Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen so welcome back from the wedding how many enjoyed the [Music] wedding so uh you are going to make this sound better this sound does not sound good my sound especially this one by the shame try to make it better because the preacher will be using this microphone so uh we I want to ask again how many here enjoyed the wedding yesterday oh my we had a had a good time I think it was a good [Music] ceremony wasn't it a good ceremony I believe it was a good ceremony it was a good ceremony indeed and we we thank God for it we thank God for brother Andrew brother Andrew thank God for uh sister phbe they did not embarrass us uh you know like I I've been wrestling with many of you young men I was I really wrestled with brother Andrew and uh he's not here but I'll share this testimony it came to a point that he was feeling he was going overage and he said pastor I've tried but I can't find a wife and I'm giving up and I'm going to marry an unbeliever so I looked at him and I told him brother and you want to marry an unbeliever it is all right with me this is your choice you see if you an unbeliever you will not go to hell but if you unbeliever you bring hell to yourself so it is your choice and I told him when the prophet says under no circumstance it does not mean that if you marry an unbeliever it will take you to hell but it will bring hell in your life whereby you will have a you will be pierced it's like sitting on a throne and you be piered throughout your life you will not be happy because you are two different people from two different uh aspects of life and you want to be sure that you you marry someone who believes like you do not only that but Maring someone who has true [Music] love true love can only be received by someone receiving the Holy Spirit that's what I preached on yester the bis of love it is true love that the Bible calls charity that one cannot fail but if you Maring on the basis of feelings which you call love oh when I think about that person me it's just feelings and that can be there tomorrow it will not be and you don't want to marry on that basis you want to marry a daughter of God so I told those things to brother Andre and I wrestled with him and I told him but brother Andre one more thing I'll tell you everything is done by faith you believe by faith you go to Heaven by faith you receive the Holy Spirit by faith even a good wife you find her by faith you may not you may not see her in the church you may not even see in other churches actually young people at dvf you have a wonderful opportunity every all the young people all over the country come to you but even after one year of hosting a youth meeting he did not find [Music] any and his wife was there but he didn't see her but I told him it is faith that does it and uh he said okay pastor brother Andrew is not a man that uh has a hard heart he has a soft heart when you adise him he hears and takes Cel all the people all the young people that have married through my hands I will tell you one thing about them M gave his testimony here I'm they all listen to C if you do not listen to the C of your and You Begin your marriage on that basis I can almost tell you you be doomed I'm telling you you have to listen to Cel it will help you it will go a long way in a way for you and said okay pastor what can I now I said what you can do is very simple just believe that God is able to give you a wife he said pastor I'm giving God only one month I told I told Brother Andrew you can even give him three days but if you take him at his word and you believe it we will pray believe it and he will do it and I told him you just need to stay in fellowship and then later on I emphasized you want an unbeliever I can even [Music] you but that's that will be your help so he said no I've decided I'm not going to just pray for me to bring my wife so we hands and we prayed in that same month he gave God one month in that same month I think was the third week he came back to me I have found [Music] her hallelujah amen I found her I've found her I said have you told her he said no so then I began guiding him on how to and I believe this is how all of you should do meetings after meetings himself and also with them both the pastor of the girl also they had several meetings with and everything went well as you saw praise the Lord amen and uh yesterday after everything uh I was telling my girls and fav let's go let's go let's go and not going say what is wrong go let's go not going I said what is wrong until told me we are waiting for the flower and I said ah the flower so all of them they like seven I think six or seven so they went behind and and sister sister phbe did like this and the flower you to see them [Applause] fighting and then do you know who got the flower do you know who got the flower we are coming for another wedding this year I will not say it publicly because some will feel [Laughter] bad but if those things are I don't know whether it is chance or what if if it is the next wedding then I will announce that she's the one who got praise the name of the Lord amen we are we are looking forward to more weddings we want all our young people to marry all of all of you who prayed at the beginning of the year said we are believing for marriage now more are coming more are coming amen those who have refused to say Amen either you young or you don't want to get married or mared so we welcome all our visitors God bless you patience I'm so happy to see you God bless you Hallelujah and I appreciated the special singers very wonderful very wonderful so today we have a friend of mine I don't know whether that is enough to call him a friend but we met brother Ken many years ago I preached in in Kenya and I was going by the stairs and then this young man came to me and he looked at me and he said I was blessed to see a young Minister and I'm younger but I also want to go into the ministry can I have your contact sure we we shared address and we started emailing back and forth and I I think I've encouraged him a little bit into going into the ministry ever since then I think either that same year or a year later I started preaching in their country I've had him come to Uganda several times also in Ethiopia and he preached in our youth first youth meetings as well and he got married later on he has a family of his own that's the trend we want to believe [Music] in get married Pur life while serving God and brother brother Ken I find him to be a very uh uh

know your ministry when we were starting our fellowship here in the house when we went down there he was with us here he has been with us so brother K is really part of this Fellowship I always tell

through we can open Daniel 11 vers we'll also read in first John and also we'll read in First Corinthians and then the rest of the scriptures can follow are you under expectation this morning I certainly feel privileged to stand before you many thanks to the pastor I like words to describe he's a man that has had an impact in my life in the ministry and it's to find such people especially in the message for a pastor to give his Pulpit someone like me as young as I am it's not something easy they they tell you sit down young man eat the word first young man eat the word fast I believe one thing when you come and exercise this gifts when we come and EXC we are right in the line of the scripture because there has to be a mod David Timothy be Titus we thank the Lord for this open door that we can stand and I know this is home so I feel so happy to be here and to have been part of the first weddding in div and we really thank the Lord for this testimony it's just an encouragement I will say that there are Cel and prayers is bearing fruits and I believe it's going to be a Gateway opened for so many more and so many more we just wish you guys all the best down in Nairobi Kenya I bring greetings from my pastor from other Brethren so many of them sent me with greetings brother Paul brother morus be preaching for them in Nairobi today have brothers that you do not know them but I believe you'll get to know them if brother M brother Moses good friends of our pastor we had him for quite some time there was a real blessing to us and I know sometimes it may sound cliche you know it's said over and over again but Brethren you're blessed don't ever get used to your pastor you might walk close to your pastor but remember this is a man given to you by God for you to receive the benefits that you lead in this life don't get used to him I know it's something strange to say when you get so familiar with someone to see them you can be able to even meet them on the street but if you want to reap the benefits what God has put in this man do not be familiar with him Accord him the respect and the honor he deserves pray for him because if you do not see the value that he has to you being that he's here I want you to know he's of value to many others so now that you have him here utilize him to the best way that can we can speak so much congratulations to the new couple I've had an experience of a Ugandan wedding together with my brother Prince we have quite a report but anyway since we came to preach the word let's turn to the scriptures in the Book of Daniel chap chapter 11 and I request that you pray for me uh the thought that I have is quite white I may not be able to push it in in one service but I just pray for the time that I shall be here I'll just give you the thought plant an idea in your heart and my prayers I was studying and preparing that I asked the Lord may this little idea be a spark that will ignite the lives of the Brethren so I pray that you'll also pray with me as you speak these things Daniel 11:32 and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but whenever you see the word it changes everything remember Peter I've toed all night I have got nothing nevertheless but when you say B everything that has been said before to be wiped away because there's something else that is going to come next you need to pay attention to so the people that do wickedly is that for you if you're a wicked person you get until there behold I go send you Elijah the prophet send you I God sent you before Elijah came you are there because I will send you Prophet without you there's no Prophet but here's the catch before the coming great and Dreadful day of the Lord uhhuh there's a prophet coming are you waiting for a dreadful day to them that are waiting for his appearing it is a great day to them so we want to read the scripture get the whole context but not be like chicken and say this is not for us it may not apply to to me it is a warning to me simply because I know I will not do wickedly let me go to the next part and see God this is the reward of the wicked I don't plan on being Wicked what about me God is a just rewarder he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek but the people that do know their God people that know their God do wicked things but the people that do their that do know their God they shall be strong hallelujah amen that is why we were singing there's a song that calls all of my strength is in you early in the morning during the daytime at night all of my strength is you God so as a strong person how do you define strength you did not Define strength by the muscles the arms you do not even measure strength your strength is measured by The Works that you do let's go to First John chapter 5 14 to 15 so we know there are people that do wickedly against the Covenant but being that is not our portion we take that scripture as a warning yes but we look for our portion now this is the thing there are people who know they God when you know something and you know that you know the Bible is defining you as a strong person and it says he will do exploits first John 5:14 says and this is is the confidence that we have in him that if you ask anything according to his will he heareth us you have a confidence that when I ask according to his will he will hear that is for a people who know their God praise the Lord amen and if we know so the knowledge is continuing we know our God and we have confidence in him and we have confidence that he hears us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him I know my God I have confidence in me I I have confidence in him I know that he hears me and big that I know he hears me I know that whatever I have asked I have it this is for our people who know and we know let me jump to 19 and we know that we are of God oh we know we are of God and the whole world lith in wickedness I want you to see something here John speaks about people that know God and wicked Daniel spoke of the same Daniel spoke of the same wickedness and people who know they God so we want to really bring a good demarcation I know we stand yes we want to do a and say you're either a wicked person and remember the wickedness and the strength of knowing your God will be seen by The Works that you [Applause] do so let's go step by step and we know that we are of God and the whole world life in darkness and we know that the Son of God is come I know I know I know I know what do you know this afternoon brother what do you know this afternoon sister and we know that the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ This is a true God and eternal life precious Heavenly Father amen we read a portion of your scripture from Lord you're going to speak a few words I ask that Lord you may give the utterance that Lord this understanding shall come down let the mind that was in Christ also be in us and when the mind of Christ is in us we will think about him when we think about him we will speak about him and when we speak about him he appears thank you Jesus as you go to speak this words father may your Holy Spirit take the to deal with each and every heart this is our prayer in Jesus Christ name amen amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus you can have your seat I want to speak about this afternoon a very small thought I've preached on on the subject uh some different texts on it I've been speaking about I know and when I knew that I was coming to this site I was really struggling in my heart and asking God what can I speak on and I still fa to continue in the same line but I want to bring a different thought and for a text I want to use this words led to a faith I've never had before I'm speaking about a faith I've never had before a faith I've never had before we know that Christian life is a journey oh sorry I have never had like it's this towel I've never had this towel before a type of faith that I have never had before no we know a Christian Life is a life of growth grow from Grace to Grace from glory to glory from anointing to anointing from power to power and I want to tell you this afternoon you also grow from faith to Faith that is what we are talking about being led the spirit of God leading you to this place where you get a faith that you've never had before our Christian Life is a life of faith brother tells us standing up from your seat and walking that he takes faith you've got to have faith that your legs are going to be able to your whatever it is that you do there's an aspect of Faith he says that faith is so unconscious it doesn't have to be intellectual it is just there you may not know it but you have faith you have faith as simple that when you breathe in you have faith that that air will go to your lungs that air will be absorbed in the blood it will go to the brain it will go to the heart it will go to each and every place how does it happen I don't know but it takes faith that is why there are certain people people that have a negative attitude they do not believe that they can be able to do a particular thing and for sure they try to do it and it fails simply because they do not have that simple faith that they can do it but I want to tell you there are different levels of Faith yes there are different levels of Faith so uh pastor preached to us one time time and he was telling us that faith is so simple we the ones who tend to complicate it sometimes when you Ser when you've served your meal maybe it's lunch you've put the meal on the table you tell the Lord bless this food may you sanctify it before I eat it you do not wait for an angel to come from heaven do not wait for the pillar of fire to come and overover over the food for you to know that it is Sanctified after saying amen you pick your spoon oh in in Uganda there are not spoons you pick your fork and you di into the F that is Faith and that is the faith that I want to talk about today the faith of you've gotten to a place where you have confidence and you can stand and say I and I want to ask you what is it that you know this afternoon Bible tells us in First Corinthians chter 13 vers 11 to 12 Saint I want to leave this pull pit I want to leave this pull pit uring that we've gotten somewhere and I know I have a short time but if you catch it within 30 minutes I'll be out of here but I'm not going to live here until you catch it the sooner you forget other things soon you're here 100% a quick short work you get to a place of know we shall be out of you 1 Corinthians 13 11 12 when I was a child I speak as a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child so the understanding which Builds on the thinking which Builds on the speaking is like that of a child but he says but when I became a man I put away childish things I put away childish understanding I put away childish thinking I put away childish speaking it is unfortunate we're Believers of the message but some of our conversations are childish conversations some of our thinking is childish thinking some of our understanding is childish understanding some of the things we have in the message today is because people still have a children mentality start and say we are bringing brother Bram in the pull pit that is childish thinking to start with can I have the pull pit for the time that I'm here to start with I never removed brother Bram from this pulit you bring back something that you had removed these are people that have moved away from Brother bram's message trying to sanctify or sanitize their conscience playing AE in the church but in real sense they need a holy ghost fi preacher come tell them get back in the line amen so we are putting away childish thinking but see as a full grown man you can take the Bible the Bible and the message is the same there is no difference because the same same Bible will tell you Hallelujah I don't know I'm getting in this life maybe there's someone here and maybe there's someone we have Malachi chapter 4 what does that speak of speaks of brother Bram that we know for sure we have Ephesians chapter 4 what does that speak of the fivefold ministry but brother it doesn't end there we also have Revelation chapter 4 where John himself is saying and I Heard a Voice from Heaven talking to me and telling me come up higher brother Bram is not the standard the fivefold ministry is not the standard Jesus Christ is a standard you Pi brother told you you pick up brother I'm told you you've taken a step you come to church listen to what the ministry you've taken a step that is not the end of the CH that is why we have Revelation chapter 10 you have the picture of the Prophet with the pillar of fire if you can display it for me Revelation chap 10 and let me say this to the young people it is unfortunate if you're here and you can be able to name the whole list of M and you're so stupid enough to be saying we bought so and so for 30 million you and who you can be able to name the full list and even the people that are on back backup yes substitute sub you can be able to name all of them but you're coming to church you cannot even say Mal 4: 5 and 6 says Revelation 10 says St Luke 1736 this is our identity Saints this is our identity have you seen it all right so now Revelation chapter 10 let me tell you Saints if there is someone that comes to you and preach to you that all things ended with brother Bram he's a DE that's right all right I I think he's not finding it but you that have that photos in your home there's a pillar of fire on top and then there's brother Branham that right there is a book of Revelation 10 but that photo is not complete because Revelation 101-6 that's the mighty Angel Revelation 107 at the bottom but there is a revelation 108 to1 I hope you're catching it all right amen yes this is it now this is the photo that I'm talking about on top here Revelation 101-6 right Revelation 107 where is revelation 108 [Applause] to1 that is the work of the ministry today to show you that you have a position and the position is the pastor is not the one with the book oh my Saints I want to believe that you know these things yes so this is it here so if I stand below here you do not even need to look at the Bible this year is The Book of Revelation 10 from top to bottom why sa you need to know you need to get to a place where you know so that you are not deceived when you know the time you're living in you know it is time to go to the angel and take the book so you not just be ding young woman you will just live any kind of life you will know the time that you're living in Praise the Lord so now a child is thinking is gone so we want to approach this and be able to get to an understanding but before we get to that I know I want to bring something across to you says this statement and he says Christians I am not trying to hurt you I am not I'm trying to stimulate your faith don't pay attention to what anybody tells you if it is contrary to that says the Lord and at the bottom there he says Now put on your thinking cup at this time he was closing but for now we opening I'm going to tell you put on your thinking cup I am opening put on your thinking cup somebody says put on your thinking cup open up your heart I want to say something here now I want you to listen close when the Holy Spirit is near I want you to put on your spiritual thinking your anointing jacket this afternoon because I want us to start thinking I want you to know before you get to to that place of knowing there are certain things that you need to understand and you need to understand before you know there's a God in heaven who knows sometimes we go through so many things in life and we start wondering does God know what I'm going through you're in school you're in college in high school there so many in the work environment and you're wondering does God know the mockery I go through having to wear this long dress my colleagues and my peers are painting their nails and their faces and I always feel I can not boy does God know what I'm going through you're having issues in your life you're battling stuff that you've gone through you went through certain things when you were little and it's unfortunate to say that some of us grow up to a certain extent but in reality we are nursing childhood traumas certain experiences that shaped our lives in a certain direction and you get into those moments where you feel does God know my issues does God know my troubles does God know that my heart is broken God know the burdens I carry sometimes the issues of Life they push you to a corner and depressed you're stressed up struggling with fear the fear of uncertainity maybe I fear marrying or getting married I don't know what is going to happen you're fearing to start a business because it collapse or maybe you're here and your business is failing you're not sure of your employment status you can be told go home anytime your children are Wayward and and there's so much heart in your so much pain in your heart does God know what I have to do does God know what I'm going through brother sister I came to tell you there is a God in heaven that knows your pain that know your cry that knows your issu and not only that oh Saints you can have a loved one who died in your heart and I come tell you brother martin oh brother I'm so sorry I know that lost a loved one I have not experienced that pain the God we serve not only knows our pain but he experienced it give me the book of Hebrews we are not serving some strange God remember it is the people who know their God right we want to know our God this afternoon we want to know what kind of a God is here does this God Have Eyes I tell you this yes he has eyes give me the pillar of fire brother does he have a hand yes he has a hand he delivered the children of Israel with his mighty arm that same hand can deliver you from trouble that same hand can deliver you from addiction that same hand can deliver you from sickness does this God have ears the B tells me in Isaiah he does he have eyes yes he has eyes which eyes not these two eyes because these two eyes can get tired they close but the other eyes regardless of where you are regardless of where you go one time one time Pharaoh thought he had CAU them but by the time Pharaoh was planning to come after the children of Israel those eyes hallelu before Moses soul before he saw praise the Lord amen we will get to it I'm feeling ched up now God had already seen and he was leading them in the front he was leading them in the front he came back those moments where you feel those moments when you feel God I'm not fing your leadership protecting you because he has eyes all you need to do keep on going by faith byth because he is Jehovah the Lord who is Ever present you're there you're feeling I'm so unrighteous I'm so unrighteous I'm righteous I don't even feel like I can come to church today don't you ever miss a church service don't you ever miss a church service this is the place where you come to be washed By the Waters of the world come come the pastor may not know may not know he knows praise God Amen he has eyes those same eyes praise God my we want to do exploits right so let's do a study your thinking caps are on your anointing jackets are on let us think on these things so now by his eyes there was a sea that was standing before them have you ever been in a situation you are in a fix you didn't know how things worked out it is because God has eyes Angry Eyes sister there was there was a young man from the world that was trying to approach your inbox you are faithful in your heart and right now you look back but where did that guy go there was a pillar of fire with red Angry Eyes amen there's a time that your business was going down there's a time where you are feeling like quitting the message our red Angry Eyes behind him Satan you're not going to have this [Applause] one amen be conscious of these things Saints be conscious of these things Hebrews chapter praise God praise God Amen Hebrews chapter 2: 16 Hebrews for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham sorry he chose he chose Hebrews 2:16 he did not come as an angel but he decided to take on the form of the Seed of Abraham and he says verse 17 wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren we have God above and then we have angels and then human beings so God himself decided to come to the lowest of he could have come as an angel but he didn't he could have decided to stay as God but he didn't but in all things all things it behoved him to be made like unto his bre you know now I might come to your house assuming you're not well off and you will only give [Music] me there'll be no at all and maybe that day that I'm visiting you I come with some meat and you cook for me that meat eat it together and then I go back home but that's not God you only have and ground that is what I will come and that is what we shall eat God as he came as a human being he came so that he can be like you in all things let's finish this and then we'll read that that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people 17 for in that he himself has suffered being tempted W look at your situation now as you're talking about these Saints this is not theory that I'm giving you the reason I'm preaching it like this because I know so I know that you also know these things so let us get ready be able to se God for who he really is because many of times you either pray or Miss and we end up missing on so many things because we do not know our God but let us know our God he himself had suffered being tempted the biggest Tri that you've gone through what the biggest Temptation that you've gone through he is able to Su them that are tempted he went through all those things so so that as you are going through them he can be able to be coming there with you son you can do this my daughter you can do this so we see one time brother Bram Ser God faithfully and was just s there wondering oh God I look at other pies this great evangelist they seem to have done so much for the kingdom of God see that have done so little they have so much money it seemed like I don't even have anything and he was just there wondering and questioning God what is wrong with me God oh God what is happening I than God he's ever faithful he hears a voice amen s we need to be connected we go through trials but when Trials come let them find me connected the only way I can be swept the only way I can be swept is if I'm not connected but if I am connected remember that ship that is on the sea no matter how much the storms may ra the wind blow everything will come and toss the Sheep but there's an anchor and it shakes the anol sickness shakes anch holds tempation shake the anchor holds children go into the world children go into the world The Anchor Holds no money in the bank the landlord is knocking you're struggling you're praying but you feel like there's no answer they anchor H amen hallelujah amen so he's here I I realized that I've lived more than half my life and I wanted to do more for the Lord and I heard a voice saying you are just starting Saint have you ever gotten to a place in such a squeeze brethren we are still knowing our god he has years to hear your prayer he has eyes to see what you're he has a mouth that gives a voice he had a voice saying you're just starting press the botle pressing again the voice said press the ble keep going and he said the voice spoke again God will ensure you hear it and you hear it right that is why he sent you a preacher every Wednesday every Friday every Sunday what is happening all the questions that you've been asking he comes here to reinforce his voice keep pressing the battle just keep pressing if you only knew what is at the end of the road praise God praise God yes the struggles are there the struggles are there the disappointments are there the challenges are there but if you only knew what is at the end of the road you keep on pressing you keep on singing you keep on praising you'll keep on giving thanks you'll keep on shouting because when you shout I hear something it may not come down in an instant it may not come down in an instance but the clock is a voice to you keep pressing the but you came to church you didn't feel like it was different come the next Sunday do you know what is happening you're like NE you're going down you came to the service washed By the Waters of the W nothing happened come to the next service come to the next service come to the next service if you only knew if you only knew what is at the end what is at the end brother the Holy Ghost is there for you salvation for your La Rapture is there for you body change is there for you praise God praise God Amen keep pressing the battle see God is a God he came down he became man and brother Bram says he's not ashamed to be called our brother look at yourself in a holy state in your lowely state he could have stayed as God and tried to do what he could have been able to do from but he didn't do that he could have come as an angel come with a proclamation and a message but he didn't do that he came down do you know the reason why when we preach we insist that you must go all the way because Jesus also went all the way he does not do any halfway jobs some he says when he saves he serves completely when he heals he heals completely Jesus goes all the way he left the seventh Dimension and went all the way where human beings are that was not enough he went all the way of hell why did he do that so that when he comes and tells you keep pressing the botle you will look at his life and say Jesus just as you overcame and you're Seated on your father's thr I will overcome and sit on your throne that's the promise for the ENT believer but you're wondering how can I overcome it's okay we will get there but let us know our God because when we know our God we will know who saved us and we know he does not do halfway job he's he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was tempted just like we are tempted because he stood the same kind of attemptation that you stand listen to this now and he took your place knowing that you couldn't take it yourself amen is that thinking clearly the reason why he came down and that's the reason that Christ God God had to become king folks to us and he come down and was made a man and he suffered Temptation and he was laugh at and made fun of and persecuted and ignored and called B boob and scoffed at and suffer death under capital punishment he had to be king folks to us he had he had to be falsely accused because you are falsely accused get these words clearly you are falsely accused he had to Bear sickness because you are sick he had to sins because it was your sins and he had to become Ken folks the only way he could redeem us was to be king folks to us and how did he become king folk by taking on the form of sinful flesh and he paid the price for our Redemption so now we see the word means to sympathize suffered all these things so that he can Su you when you tempted so that he can simp so that he can sympathize with you and there's nobody that can sympathize with you if they do not feel your pain so he he knows your pain he knows what you've gone through and that's the reason he become this that he might be sympathetic with you when you have your ups and downs and your little ins and outs he knows how to sympathize with you he sits there to make intercessions he sits there to love you and though you go astray he will not leave you and now can I tell you one thing if you know these things you cannot go astray because you already know I cannot go deep in sin the moment I do something wrong I run quickly and repent I will not let this conversations with a sister end up to meeting with her without the parents knowledge or something like that I wouldn't let it go to that place where we are talking late in the night we are meeting in certain places because you are a person who knows your god what we need is to get to a place where we get to know our God because when we know God there are certain things no matter how we go through we will be able to stand and say before I went through this God saw it God knows it so you go back to God and inquire from God God should die do because God has an answer for every situation God has an answer for everything I hope we can be able to see that now that this God has a hand that his ears are not heavy that his eyes can be able to see and that is why he could tell Jeremiah he tells him that even before you were born let me just get that exact scripture in Jeremiah 1 verse 5 we want to a we want to get to a place where we will know right says before I formed the in the belly I knew thee before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained the a prophet unto the Nations 1 verse 5 Jeremiah 29 I know the thoughts that I think towards of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end also show you that God has already planned out everything where we really miss out on is we get out of the plan of God Sint if God is making you go through a certain trial God has a reason for it remember what he said concerning job the devil was there and it was like have you seen my servant job I think let's read that in Job chapter one Job chapter one job chter 1 ver we will come back to job as we finishing and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the the earth a perfect and an upright man one that fearth God andth evil before job went whatever it is that he went through God had a testimony concerning him I can say God knew him God knew his life and if you continue reading see that sat is given permission to go and do whatever he wants with him so did God know whatever Satan was going to do yes God knows because he knows everything and if I can go ahead of my sermon and tell you this when you realize that God knows you this way it changes the way you think it changes the way you do things it's very easy during preaching to keep on quoting and saying that names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life even before the foundation of the it's very easy to repeat that stat but get me a person who knows who really really knows that their name is in the book there is nothing that you can do that can move this man his thinking is different he knows I came from God and I go back to God because why was your name written in the of because God in his book it's a great book of redemption God was playing a drama and in the preview of the drama you know before they release a movie a movie can be three hours now the young people are looking at me know these things you watch those movies before a movie is released what comes before a trailer thank you thank you for the honest Brethren there's a trailer a preview so it is just a few sections of the movie that shown in advance to give you some sight of what the drama is going to be about so the preview that God gave was a book and this book he SLE a lamb and he dipped his finger in the in the blood of the lamb and he wrote the names in the book that was the end of the preview that was the end of the preview now here we are acting out the movie what is the movie all about the drama is in the book so when the preacher is coming God is the director using the preacher relay the film to you and when you're hearing the message what is happening names are being called when your name is called it is my time let me tell you now there are certain places and certain things that were not shown and these things were hidden that is the reason why you are coming to this world was through perverted you remember the wise men they came one way went back another way what am I trying to tell you these are previews concerning you we have a drama inside a drama and the people that know it has to take people that are thought receive the understanding that John was talking about can be able to get in the drama decod their positions because what is a drama one person can wear even up to 20 masks one actor one actor and we are let by one we are led by one the producer the director said I'm not going to sit up in heaven when they shooting those films the director usually sits on a high chair he backs instructions by the director the producer of the film I'm not going to see in heaven and give instructions I am going to go down because one of those Mas involve a Dr one of those masks involve a prostitute one of those masks whatever sin you can mention all those are masks Jesus he came down I'm not going to stay up in heaven I am going to come down I am going to feel each and everything that the actors go through but this is the thing a drunkard he's an actor let me ask you something is a drunker really himself he's playing a part he's playing a part in God's Great drama we want to know so let us go back we are going to the mind of God now could not become a savior if there was no sin he could not become a Healer if there was no sickness there has to be low moments in your life so that he can be the one who lift you up I want you to understand I want you to know whatever you're going through in life that is not you I want you to look at your challenge now I want you to look at whatever has been oppressing you you've been a Believer all this time but you're not reaping the fruits of the message look at those things now now and tell them this is not me you've struggled with something for so long right now right after service speak to it this is not me speak to that issue speak to that challenge because we've started growing in the knowledge of Jesus Christ we've started knowing sometimes when these actors their roles for so long they sort of forget who they are but I thank God day after day names are being called brother Bram says you are hearing from your theop so what happens you played the part of a sick brother the part of a weak sister the part of a never failing person the part of a defeated Christian the part of a prayerless Christian but the director is holding the book and reminding you this is just God's Great drama if you feel lost if you feel lost this is what happens you know they acting on the stage and behind them is a cutting when you get so carried away in your act the director CA you a can be in your closet can be in your prayer room and gives you an Insight look the curtain of time look the C of time look the curtain of sickness look the curtain of disease look the curtain of defeat look the curtain of amnesia when you look past the curtain what is happening they you P the C of time is introducing yourself I know this will sound confusing when oh Hallelujah just allow me I'll read these quotations later they're all in the message when the message is going forth it his names being called and the names that are being called has to take another you identify Prince this is you look at your problem this is not me [Applause] [Music] this we need to know we need to know remember the story of that little boy that only had a small piece of mirror his father used to shave his beard and he had to struggle to see where the beards are and this one time they visited their auntie in the city and they happened to have a big mirror before he got to the Mirror of a perfect man before he could get to the top of the mirror he had to climb seven steps amen he had to climb seven steps while you coming to church you're climbing the seventh step from step one and as he's climbing maybe from the first step he could see the top of his head when you came to the message something in he was not agreeing with me and and preachers something and he was not agreeing with painted faces was not agreeing with wearing trousers for women you're climbing the step of Faith you could see a little portion and you climb another step you see another portion you CL again when you see your you don't start rejoicing the more you seeing the more you keep on going the more they went into the land the more they kept on fighting there was no rest the more they kept on going when you see what God has in store for you you pray a prayer today and God answers it don't stay there pray more when you're Justified and you see your face don't stop there there is still yet more land possessed and he kept on going amen and he kept on going from Faith from faith virt on and on and on until he got to the top when he got to the Top This was something strange yet so familiar does that sound something to you strange but yet familiar like that little book just like that little book sweet in mouth but be the belly why is it strange yet so because oh God how can me a creature of time be a candidate for eternity that is strange but yet again yet so familiar how can I a sea born in sin sh in iniquity become a saint be seated in Heavenly places that is very strange so familiar amen we are knowing right amen we are knowing right we are knowing right and the little bo reaches up this is strange yet so familiar lifted his hand and waved hello hello and the little boy said hello when you hear the word and something in you says amen that little boy something in oh my let me read that quote let me read that [Applause] quote praise the Lord is this good amen amen you can find it in the message says here we are for to the word image it will be quite but please allow me to read you can understand these things to be a partaker of the word Fe the by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you joined this church and joined that church you try this and that nothing satisfi that's right but one day you just recognized it and and he continues to give that story of that Mama ego I would get into it because of time he closing he says this well you jump you're an eagle to begin with you're a chicken you are a chicken you're not a chicken so he made his first jump and flopped his wings he didn't do too good but he got off the ground I would encourage you to go read this section clearly when you get home's talking about Mama e and the you see the little iglet was an eagle to start with the mama Eagle didn't come to turn the little iglet into an eagle you are a son of God to begin with and my purose here this morning is to let you know that you've always been a Son of God you are a son of God and you'll always be a son of and this realization does something to you and he says then after you've recognized the very word of God and that it was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the living you heard from your theop amen praise the Lord amen that is why coming to church if you take coming to church as an ordinary thing you what unto you the speaking to someone today praise the Lord amen so you see this here there's so many things I wanted to get to and I've not even scratched the surface but I trust we are knowing something we are getting to see our identity because since the sooner we see this the better it will be for us and we no longer going to live under privileged lives First Corinthians chapter 13 where we were we'll read verse 12 1 Corinthians 13:12 says this that we' read previously for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part then shall I know even all even as all amen since I hope we see this there's a place where we are known and I want to bring it in this context Paul says that then then then like referring to a future time that then shall I know and I just want to tell you these things then is no longer there now but then is now now let me show you this you see the Devil is a master doing things brother Bram say somewhere that if you get to a place I think she'll been Church ages where the bride where the bride knows who she really is he actually says that Satan will be powerless before her now I'm just going to take it through a little bit so that we can catch these things and he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is now I want you to understand brother bram's words Paul as he was writing was referring to a future but brother Bram is saying revelation of the true church and what she will be no but the revelation of the true church and what she is what she will stand for no sir but what she stands for and that she will do but she can do right here right now that she can do the Greater Works once she knows that then she will be an invincible Army this is the Revelation that Satan has been fighting since time Memorial he doesn't want you to look past the curtain of time he wants to look at the you that is acting the drama he does not want you to hear your name when the director is reading the script because the preaching of the word it is names that are being called Satan does not want you doing that he wants to keep you in a place where you are looking for it instead of looking at it you're looking for something in the future not realizing that it is actually right here with you remember that little boy that had a small piece of stamp that was worth quar million dollars quar million was but he didn't know what happened in his mind when he had the stamp he could only think of an ice cream and the postman he I'm going to the postman get some 5 cents and with the five cents I'm going to get an ice cream but that that stamp was wor a lot more that is why that is why we are putting our childish thinking we are putting our childish understanding we are putting our childish speaking we are coming to church to be taught so that we can understand the value of the stamp that is in our hands because five cent mentality is not going to cut it because this little boy have the purchasing power to buy a whole ice cream store and buy other things and that is the power that is in the church today only she can know but the devil doesn't want you to know even this afternoon he doesn't want you to know but I want to repeat it again they that know their God they that know who they are they shall do exploits the devil wants you to keep on postponing you keep on postponing you know we looking for that super Church you and who I have already found it I have already found it is why I'm here sweating telling her that you need to know that you need to come up here you need to go to the angel and take the little book because in the book is your identity in the book is your name amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so many things that we could get to but I just want to finish with this we've read about job a man that was loved by God so much a man that God spoke great things conc and you see he got to this place why he went through so much and he was always SE on the As and brother Bram says we are all on the aips we have our troubles our ups and downs our bad moments our sicknesses our heartaches and our disappointments but he says but then in the midst of all that trouble God came to his rescue job is seated in the asip the problem was not only his sickness he had boyss all over he had troubl he had heches his family was gone his wealth was gone and he was looking at creation and is wondering I know there is someone that brought me to this earth I just couldn't come here by myself I want Saints the moment you start asking this question know this time you're going to read it when you get back home you need to get to a place where you ask God questions for God to prove to you that you are his son Abraham was a father of many nations right but there came a time God spoke to Abraham look at the Sand generation is going to be comes to him again moves him from the dust to the stars look up to the Stars you're receiving this message that is moving you from the dust to the stars from the Earthly to the Heavenly from time to Eternity from the Earthly the terrestrial to celes but hearing these things is not enough Genesis 15:7 Abraham asks God how will I know God you said that you'll give me the Holy Ghost How Will I Know God you Sav I will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover how no God said that if I know who I am I become an invincible Army will I know that's right Saints just give me some few more minutes amen what does God do right there he enters into a covenant with Abraham you'll forgive me I wanted to rush to job so that I can finish but I've been asked to go back to Abraham so let me be obedient and I trust you'll also go with me amen so now Abraham has asked how will I know and God is a faithful God Saint so what happens here he says Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it How will I know God the promise of the Rapture the promise of a body change all these are great promises God your word is so sweet when I hear it something in my heart always says amen that God I want to move to a place of not just hearing but I have heard with my own ears and now I see and when you hear and you see now you can know and you're telling God all these things are good but I want to know and the Bible says and he said unto him Me 3 years old she T and pigon all those [Applause] things and at this point at this Point God was entering into a covenant with him and the Bible is very clear and brother Bram tells us that this Covenant was an unconditional Covenant a covenant between two people but Abraham all you need to do only be [Applause] [Music] praise God Amen and you wonder why the angel loved this song you wonder why the angel loved this song it reminds the angel of the Covenant and there's nothing as powerful as when a people that know their God and their Covenant remind God of their Covenant in his Fallen condition brother sister does not matter how far you've gone it does not matter how far the children have gone Wayward I'm against this teaching in the message I'm against this teaching in the message I'm against this teaching in the message that if your children go Wayward you leave them alone God will deal with them Pastor if I'm wrong you'll come and correct it say let me ask you why would God give you children to trouble you yeah fine we know we saved as individuals yes but why would God give you children do you know your God your God is Not That unfair the our God is Not That unfair and I'm challenging any parent today if your children have gone Wayward I want you to remind God of his Covenant this is why I said we need to put our childish thinking why would God give you children to trouble in your later years you can't sleep well at night because you're always wondering what of my children out of my children I just I'll just ask you one thing as you are bringing them up did you teach them the Bible Check Yes did you take them to Sunday school check yes did you take them to a Bible believing Church yes God I did my part to the best of my ability I apply the token I am not going to have children that are disturbing me heartaches day and night oh God God of sister intervene in my situation why you know your God while we struggle and get tossed up and about is because we do not know our God but look atun she didn't know much of the Bible she didn't know much of the message but she knew her God and when a person who knows their God goes down their knees the airport was busy that day flight to Switzerland flight to this place Europe to this place but there was an atiim that knew her God and when he got she got her prayers created a storm why she knew her God am so Abraham Abraham go bring this and what was God doing God was giving a preview of Calvary and he says this here notice this he told Abraham now he cost a deep sleep to come upon Abraham you haven't got nothing to do with this am going to do it that's the problem with young people you don't want to get into good sleep for God to give you wife sleeping means You Close Your Eyes Adam slept God gave him a wife Abraham slept God confirmed his Covenant now we see this here God was showing I want you to notice God was showing Abraham Calvary what he was going to confirm this Covenant between Abraham and Abraham's seed forever so I want you to understand that we go back to job and job says here he's in this place of disappointment and he's wondering I want you to have Calvary in mind now okay a place of disappointments his wife is telling him why don't you cast God he's looking at the tree if the tree goes down it leaves again when the flower goes down it comes up again but when a man goes to sleep when he dies the family just comes and They Mourn the death of the person and They Mourn the death of the person and they go away and he was wondering and he might be there wondering I'm having many challenges more now than even before I was a Christian more than before I came into the message we have more troubles when we become Christians and the Bible says that many is the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers him from them all so I want you to look at your challenge I want you to look at your Affliction and see the promise of God yes he promised afflictions he promised strange things some that would even be beyond our understanding but they are always done for our good that is why you have someone like Paul has gone through so many things imprisoned he's been beaten he's been mocked Shipwrecked but he stands and say I am not ashamed I know whom I have believed he says we are troubled on every side but we are not distressed we are perplexed but we are not in despair we are persecuted but we are not forsaken we are cast down and we are not destroyed why Paul knew something Paul knew something and he was speaking according to the revelation of his faith so we see you will see if you could grasp that today that all our troubles that there is none of us that is immune from them if you realize if that they are for our own good our thinking will change it is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than when the trial come that thing that you going through that challenge that you facing that Temptation that you're going through it is to bring you to a place where God can make himself more real to you than he was before the that sickness that has been troubling you for so long it is there so that the glory of God can be seen we are knowing right amen we are knowing let us keep on knowing now because many of times challenges will come we praise the challenge instead of praising God but when we know our thinkings change and brother Bram will say this himself and I want to join in this morning with job to say that I've lived a long enough life to know that that is a truth that I've seen it in my own life he was there wondering how about my life and then God comes and visits him and he says and he see Satan tries to make us nervous upset us to get us to think why did this happen why couldn't I have been like this why couldn't I have been like brother so and so why couldn't I have been like sister so you are like that so that the glory of God can be seen I want you to start knowing these things you are peculiar in his sight you you are peculiar in his sight what does that mean even if you are the only person on Earth Jesus would have still left Heaven come down to die for you that is how precious you are to him and he knows he knows your trouble and he says but you see and all these things all of them he he got to a point where he saw this is job now God is speaking about job he saw the vision of Easter remember job as he's going through all these things God knows him right he got to a place where he even stood and Sav even if he slays me yet I will still serve him brother Bram gets to a point in life even if I serve God all this time and after all my life he sent me to hell I will go to hell praising the Lord why he knew something we want to catch this things what these people knew what Abraham knew after the calary experience in that message that on Calvary brother Bram says there has never been a day like Calvary and there never will be a day like Calvary there's something special about Calvary because at Calvary that is why you know hallelujah amen we sing a song that while he was on the cross I was on his [Applause] mind since I wish we had time we could have gone through all these things in that message brother Bram says you can be honest you can be just you have to forgive me brother if you can really get that place I I feel like these things are very important because if you do not know these things we will keep on beating around the bush 64 paragraph 64 on Calvary he broke the powers of Satan he broke he opened the prison doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died what death will do to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors and he let every captive Go free that is what that is what Paul could say where is your sting where is your Victory Paul knew something because he said I want to know him and know him in the power of his resurrection you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin is there something you're struggling with today you don't have to I came all the way from Nairobi to tell you and my prayer and my hope is that you know you don't have to you don't have to no longer be Tor down by sin you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin drinking smoking gambling telling lies gossiping biting I do not know this the spirits that bother dvf but there are some here but I came to tell you that you don't have to you can be honest do you know you can be honest you can be just ight and Satan and Satan and Satan can do nothing Satan can do nothing do you know Satan can do nothing Satan can do nothing about it that is what Calvary should mean to you I'll not continue the rest but there are some other quotations and brother continues to say that that is what these people knew and that is the reason why someone like Abraham was looking for a city whose build and maker is gone that is why the elders the prophets were being buried in Israel because that is the resurrection I believe I preached this year some time back where I was asking you where was Moses buried the Bible tells us that nobody knows where he's buried but by Revelation I can tell you Moses had to have been buried in the promised land because that is the only way I could appear with Jesus in Transfiguration because rure to place in the Promised Land Elijah was taken up in the promised land that is whyless of whatever it is that you go through you need to be buried in Christ because that is the place where you find your identity and he says this then he must have seen the vision of Easter and that is when he cried I know oh my redeemer live I know that I shall see him and at the last days he will stand on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah for I know my redeemer brother Bram asks what do you know job I know I iing what do you know brother I know my God heals all diseases I know my God forgives all iniquities I know my God what do you know as he stand on our feet what do you know this afternoon and he says this and if job by a vision could stand so firmly Upon A Promise how much more ought we to do after Christ has risen from the dead and send back the Holy Spirit as a seal of promise that we too shall leave you see they were all looking forward to this things by Vision it had not really happened but for us it has happened since there's nothing new I'm bringing to you this message is to bring you to a place where you know who you are that each and every that you go through Saints I hope you really really catch this each and everything that you go through is specially designed and it is for a purpose brother Bram went through a sudden Series in his life we all know that he had that nervous condition which was a stomach problem and he saw the Lord concerning it for so long and it really troubled him so much but it got through a certain place I won't get into the story but he got into a certain place where God led him through a series of events and God confirmed to him that actually I know of your trouble and your deliverance is about to come and you know what happened that time the song that we usually sing on the wings of a snow white it usually had two verses it only had two verses but after this experience brother Bram another verse and this is what he says though I have suffered in many ways I cried for healing both night and day but Faith was not forgotten by the father above he gave me his sign on the wings what am I trying to drive atten I want you to start looking at your life not from a physical point of view I want you to change your view remember the cloud that was photographed for quite some time brother Bram used to view it wrongly until the angel came to him and told him turn it to the right and when he turned the view he could not see the face of Jesus Christ you've been looking at your life and nothing seems to be going right you've been asking a lot of questions I just want you to do something change your point of view change your eyes now pick the eyes of God look at your life Through The Eyes Of God look at your life through his and you will realize you are a supernatural being going through a natural life and after this experience these are the words that brother Bram speaks dear God I thank you for these things father you gave no other sign you gave no other sign you gave the world a sign and you give me a sign this was something that was so personal L him to this point of I know and he says this and the next they sing that eagle flying there's a message coming forth now and I pray God that you will let the dve lead Grant it Lord it led me to a faith I never had [Music] before and listen to the next words a faith that he's never had before makes him say this I know God I know it's going to be all [Music] right watch your trouble watch your situation as a brother plac for me that song Set Your [Music] Wings you can climb to a higher Place s an eagle you were born to be an eagle you might have been living among chicken you might have actually assimilated some chicken characters but I came here to tell you you are an eagle you've always been an eagle all you need to do flop

climb up and you climb to one level of justification that's good enough brother but you need to come up I don't know what level you are but I want to tell you and I came to tell you there is more

I don't know if there is another anyone here who would like to give your life to Jesus if you can raise up your hand they still here or they've [Music] left okay so if they there maybe we'll see them later on so praise the name of the Lord how many has God spoken to today amen we thank God for that you know there's something I've seen last Sunday we had Pastor Jesse and the other Su I think it is me who ministered but from the from the beginning God has emphasized the inspiration he gave at the beginning of the year he said it will be another phase and it was going you know it was about that red SE Crossing and how when they were crossing the Red Sea they were entering into another phase of their Liv and at the Red Sea when they were crossing the Egyptians also came chasing after them and God now the pill of fire brother if you could give us that pill of fire again that pill of fire was always the Bible says he was always leading the children of Israel God was dressed or clothed within that pill of fire so we can say that the pill of Fire is God it is the same Pillar of Fire that made Paul how many remember that in the book of Acts the same P of fire met Paul and blinded his eyes and when Paul said who are you out of that a voice said I am Jesus and that is the simp pill of fire and God in the in in the in in the first Exodus he he was leading them with in the pill of fire giving them light by the night and in darkness and that same pill of fire now when the Egyptians were coming to to kill them from behind running after them that pill of fire moved from the front of the children of Israel to their back and the Bible would go on to say God looked at the Egyptians through that Pillar of Fire and just by looking at them their Childs began tearing apart they you know they began dying just by God looking at them through the pill of fire oh my God and all of them were destroyed and that pill of fire is right behind us hallelujah amen and the brother spoken about the same thing also spoke about the same thing also I never told them what I was preaching God has eyes seeing through the pill of fire there are two things in this picture there is this man called William Bram a prophet of God a preacher from America he died 1965 more than 50 years ago and his ministry was actually a worldwide Ministry and his ministry fulfilled Malachi 4: 5 which the brother quoted and says behold I send you Elijah the brother Isaac if you could also put that online for our view online viewers as well and that man's ministry as Elijah had Elijah anointing upon him the anoint of Elijah does not come on a group of people it usually comes on one man it was elah the with it and Elish was the first one to have that anointed then John the Baptist was the second and now the third time we see the spirit of el coming upon another was in this man's Ministry and while he was you know because after the second world war his ministry introduc reintroduced the healing movement many people were opposing saying God cannot heal without a doctor but in William bram's Ministry we saw Divine he being restored forget about what you're seeing now on TVs and everything many of it is fake and some of it is true but that anointing was restored in the days of the ministry of this man follow me closely here because I know there are some who did not know what the brother was talking about and so his ministry also restore to us the teachings of the Bible the it Resto to us the true understanding of the Bible if you notice I'm saying restore restore does not mean to bring anything new it means to bring back what was already there so William bram's Ministry did not did not introduce a new religion but it restored the original teachings of the Bible which the churches and the religions took away I'll give you two or three examples water baptism it is supposed to be in much water in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to ad and understand and believes but the religion remove and they with infant baptism and they replace it God instead of somebody to decide for they brought introduced Trinity baptism Father Son and the Holy Ghost but but when the he came and and kicked told him let us go back let us go back to go back the gopel to the of who understand name of the Lord Jesus and the whole world there is nobody who baptized in Apostolic baptism apart from those who believes in the message of this man why because his message that's why he say that's not different from because his it brings us back to the scriptures amen and he true understanding of God because they used to teach us there are three uh persons in one God but it says all those are trash and they taught one God Father Son and the Holy Ghost those are the titles three titles of one God amen amen and that's why talk of human preachers you find them preaching everywhere you told us that is wrong the Bible it teaches us that no man supposed to be a past amen amen the churches which does not believe in women in women preachers they the one who believes in the message of William Bram amen amen now my brothers the Min of William BR rest us back to the Bible we are the true Bible belever we are the true Bible Believers because we receive the min which rest t back to the doctrine of the tell your brother your sister we are we are the True Believers he did not come to point us to himself but he came young men at the back listen to this he never came the prophet never came to tell us that I'm the prophet follow but what did he come to to point us to Jesus Christ the B that's why I believe in the ministry of William Bram because brother he never came to point us to he came to point us to the word of God he came to point us to the script he came to point us to Christ he never came to start a new religion he came to restore the old doct of the Bible and now we are restored say Amen his ministry is the one that fulfills the script Revelation 10: 7 that in the days of of the seventh angel when he started when we started the mystery of God shall be finished who remembers what Pastor J preached when he came here streaming what did he preach you forgot already okay who remembers yes brother Enoch thou shall do what thou sh prophesy again today this Minister he came and told that's what he said what demonstrated here said that if I'm also under here this is the complete now go and get your it is that that pill of fire that pill of fire who is that pill of fire is the Lord Jesus Christ the up the one who of Israel in the the one Jesus of the Old Testament who is that Jesus who came and manifested when and they photographed and they took it atbi and they exam and they proved they confirmed that the pillar of fire was and they said this the first time in the history some the phenomenon which is Supernatural to be photographed by the cameras this was the first time in the history now when you read it in but in our generation the P of fire was photographed and that is it if you have got Revelation say Amen that is revelation 10: 1 now the seventh verse what does it say in the days of the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel now here is he we've been having seven angels the Angels means The Messengers or the prophets ever since went back from the time of the Apostles the first Angel was he was called Paul now Paul other follow follow until the last generation that's when Willam came so he is the last messenger who brings the last message which is going to prepare the second coming com of the Lord Jesus Christ this is the seventh angel he said that when we begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished he started to sound he died many years ago over 50 years ago before you were Bor and and and [Laughter] you even my mother was not born you see he died in 65 you hear that so this not it's not on man it's all about the message he left we are not following man we are following his message when says that the seventh angel will start to sound when he begin that sounding is what you're speaking about and we are not pointing on the man that's what we are talking about when we are pointing on man now that message when it was given out the last one last in the eth ver he say what does he you will prophesy again you'll prophesy again now we are the one prophesying we are prophesying right now after we have eaten the opening book so let us begin Revelations 10 from verse one is up the seventh verse is in the middle of this man the E the eth verse is me say Amen brother K God bless you this is the first service
