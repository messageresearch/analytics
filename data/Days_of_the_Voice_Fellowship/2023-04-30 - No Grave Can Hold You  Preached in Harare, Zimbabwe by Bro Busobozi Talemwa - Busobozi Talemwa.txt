I think that's about 12 years ago and so I'm 32 now I was 20 then and I spent about a month and a half in Zimbabwe so I'm within our dreams at that time I was you know trying to listen to the Lord what he had in plans for us I wasn't married it was a time when I was entering full-time into the ministry and the Lord has been good ever since I've been married 10 years now and I've been serving the lord and preaching this message 17 years now and I want to say God has been good received greetings from my family from the church days of the voice Fellowship in Kampala my family I have five children my God's grace I want to say the message is good because in there is everything that we need notified how am I expecting this morning amen just those few words just to introduce myself to you so you don't figure me out as I'm preaching that the Lord will speak to us this morning God sent his son [Music] they called him Jesus thank you he came to life he lived and the night to buy my battle s [Music] is there to prove myself if you believe in sick with all your heart now because because [Music] oh my friends [Music] [Music] I will cross that River oh yes Lord I will find life I know

[Music] Lord Jesus we come to you this morning father Lord we come to you with rejoicing in our hearts Lord because you leave we confess tomorrow because you live oh God all our fears are gone and we are here this morning boldly coming before your throne of grace oh God and we ask that oh God you give us one more opportunity in your presence Lord Jesus where you can come and deliver Amen to the bound and set free the captives where you can come and open the graves oh God and cause a Deliverance cause even something to happen in our life this morning whereby we can now by the end of the service be able to say because he leaves all our fear is gone desire my prayer Lord this morning we give this service now to you Lord in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen [Music] amen take our Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 27.27 would like to while you are opening to take this opportunity to uh thank the pastor brother mahanda for uh opening the platform for us to come and speak to you this morning and uh also Pastor Joseph chikosi uh when he had that we were coming down here he asked that we come and speak to you we were invited by Brother side down I think it is in the South I'm not too sure to come and speak that we incidentally we took meetings to the same meetings we preached at the same meetings in Kampala some I think last year and that's how we go to to get to know each other and so uh we were down in Johannesburg with a brother mahere he asked us to send greetings to yourself amen so we are taking uh the reading from Matthew 27 verse 62 Matthew 27 62 I appreciate pastor mandurah we had a wonderful time at Zimmer Park uh even and uh brother Gideon in Ethiopia we also were in Ethiopia before so uh brother Solomon I think yes uh but the Gideon was asking me you need to go to Pastor Solomon's and one brother told me he would be the meetings here so the Saints uh I believe are here so we have also visited so we're reading from verses 62.62 we will read up to verses 66.66. now the next day that followed excuse me read that again now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together onto pirate saying so we remember that the deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will raise again commander of Father decepaka be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last era shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchan sure sealing the stone and setting a watch ing it is Lord Jesus well for a few moments we are speaking into the patches of your blood I ask that you will come and let your Holy Spirit come and take control now we invite you in this place in Jesus name amen may be seated I would like to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ do you mind coming stand with me brother amen I think you can come he can come up here and we preach together amen so uh my subject to you this morning is No Grave can hold you No Grave can hold you tell your neighbor No Grave can hold you Hallelujah you see Jesus Is Our Savior yes when the importance we're doing but we also know that Jesus was God in flesh God himself had come to visit uh to not only this but he had come to uh change the destiny of mankind and when he came down he came down with a sure walk you know there are many people who go into business and they're not too sure about the business and so many of those businesses end up failing because they did not maybe count the cost They Don't Know What It Takes or what it took to be able to succeed in that business but our God is Not Like a Man anymore our God is always sure about all his businesses and when he came down he came down on a short day and so today the whole world is remembering the death and barrier and resurrection of Jesus Christ and I was thinking about Jesus how when he came down on us you know he knew what he was going to do but he you know as a man he was fearful you know we believe that Jesus is God how many believe that Jesus is God Jesus 100 God but also Jesus was man 100 so when he came down he was in human flesh and the Bible says he was found in a fashion as a man anymore and so he humbled himself the death even of the Cross but he was fearful just like you and me but you know there is one thing that was sure if Jesus was going to go through that Journey if Jesus was going to die if Jesus was going to be buried there was one thing sure that the grave could no longer hold him he was sure about that he wasn't fearful about [Music] hallelujah amen and so when he died you know the whole story of how you know the suffering and the beating and everything and so then he comes to the place when now he was buried he actually went all the way to hell again his death foreign uh let me let me not talk about hell so much today because I'm talking about the grave so he went away from the grave while he was there in the grave the devil thought he could hold him the devil was walking through men who thought they were religious men who thought they knew what they were talking about who thought they had phds in theology religion for years and years and so they came and advised actually it was the Pharisees that came to Pilates you read the Bible again verse 62 it says the chief priests and the Pharisees they came to Pilots religion and politics United together and they said do you remember what the deceiver said while he was yet alive he said after three days he will rise again can you imagine the religious they called our savior this is what they are calling him again in our generation yeah they are calling him the deceiver by rejecting this message they are calling him the deceiver by rejecting what God has done in Our Generations but let me tell you do the Believers who know the truth I know he's not a deceiver we know he's a faithful Savior we know it's a faithful one and true one and every word he says will surely come to pass how many I believe that you are not saying that well don't wait for me to begin preaching you better preach with me by saying amen amen I know this is the first meeting hallelujah amen I'm not waiting for music to warm me up I'm already warmed up by the word so if you want me to preach to you to this morning forget about everything else foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] and that's why we can never leave the message because the message is true tell your neighbor the message is true the other part will be married and so they said you know he said that after three days after three days that he said he would rise up again and he said commands United States [Music] foreign they did not know he was not going to come out as a dead body he was going to come out alive that's why some people who love crucifix on the crucified yes sometimes they put a body there a dead body but our savior our savior is alive he came out of the grave and so they said you go and secure it is disciples come by night and steal him away the same people you know they will say that he is risen from the day and so the first the last era will be worse than who do you think this was [Music] [Music] [Music] but I wanted to hear what the prophet says in a message you go tell my disciples Hallelujah all right I'll just first read the same yesterday and forever Faith takes this place right there can't check it away because the word of God said I will not leave my soul in Hell notice there is I just wanted to take a moment and think about it doesn't matter how strong the grave was it doesn't matter how good you know it was protected and what seal was on there that had already gone forth now go tell my disciples he says I can see this the great morning star hanging Yonder in its sockets [Music] who had hung there since the beginning of time and I see he says I see that big morning because I begin to move I can see it take a circle Mary and them watching it what is it doing it's an angel and it's looking around for the grave where they had laid here the scripture oh my God praise the Name of Love the prophet says the scripture was getting ready amen hallelujah let me tell you why the reason why I'm excited because I am reading about Jesus I'm putting myself in that place is talking about you and me if we decides Jesus died and by the way in your sins and trespasses the scripture was getting ready to be fulfilled and he says brother sister whenever a scripture praise the name of the Lord whenever scripture of God is ready to be fulfilled don't you worry it will be right there amen God is what never fails heaven and I shall pass away but the word of God will never pass away because the word of God is always and he says I can see that stars moving around and then he says I can see the Romans standing there a hundred of them if he says 100 of them I believe it is strong with their swords bro we will see what takes place praise the name of the Lord amen can I have three brothers come up here please all right now brother can you just can you lie down this is not this is a very clean place there is a carpet so can you lie down yes lie down brother God bless you God bless you thank you so much all right yes right you lie down lie down all right okay now here was Jesus in the grave and oh brother you were coming you could come up no problem anybody wants to come and here were the soldiers standing if Sanders are such a better not as a farmer and and soldiers were standing there with the swords drawn out and here was the savior of the world and he says the soldiers are drawn their swords nobody will take him out of here we are here to keep him in here they were meeting business nobody there come and take him out of here but he says don't you worry hallelujah amen something was amen going to take place let me tell you this is not only Jesus this was you lying in that grave this was during the grave of Hallelujah and he says it turned out it turned out to be the mighty angel of God who stood there hallelujah amen do you know what the soul you know what happened to the soldiers do you know what happened he says the soldiers fainted why are you standing the soldiers Hallelujah [Applause] do you know what happened there do you think our Lord was still in there I want to say rose again this Great Mighty big angel with all the seals amen he says you know with just a brush of his hands he moved it back the stone was laid back and he broke the romance and here was our savior and they removed him out of the grave and I want to say No Grave could hold him this is what is going to happen no scientists to those demons in some sorts of grave some of you may be seated right here the graves of depression God bless you Brothers [Applause] hallelujah amen let me tell you we didn't leave the nominations no this message has one purpose and he says what does the Romans still mean to him or anything else God has to leave he has to come out he can't live among the Dead amen back in your family you might have had something that got through the family and everybody knows that in our family we don't get married or even if we got we get married we don't stay that is a grave that is a great listen the bride of Christ as long as you are a child of God you are here you are here to break the cycle you cannot live among the dead no no no no no no no we are the Believers of this Mercy we cannot live among the dead we are here to destroy the works of Saturn [Music] Your Grave can hold us whatever Jesus did he did it for me [Music] his resurrection was for you if No Grave could hold him [Applause] amen yes the Bible says in the book of Colossians 2 12. with him in baptism with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead I'm talking about you being dead in your sins time I pay you together with him having forgiven you all your trespasses whatever your trespassers Ephesians 2 1 it says and you as a quickened my visit who were dead and trespasses he walked according to the cause of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit now worketh and the children of disobedience is a transforming power is to be quick and means to be made alive opinion am I preaching to someone here this morning how can we be in the graves those Graves may not be physical Graves people many Christians are in spiritual Graves and we live below our Privileges and we let the devil bury Us in those Graves let me tell you some Believers even are in the graves of property but for us we say we are believers of the message yeah [Music] because the Bible says we should we should be heads and not tails and it is more blessed to do what to give than to receive how can you give what you don't have Jennifer I'm here to tell you why is the pride of Christ not accept any conditions of what the promises we have in the world if it is not like what the promises [Music] which the devil can't keep in the grave and they become depressed and oppressed by demons and you know they go over the same thing you know like a cycle the devil is very good at attacking us he will say believe what you want to believe as far as your life is concerned I am in control so you find many Believers not living in the life of the world hallelujah amen and God has sent preachers foreign we are Resurrected how many believe that we are Resurrected please help me put on your lips we are resurrected I am Resurrected oh that was just one percent of you I am Resurrected what is it I am Resurrected we are now now it is TV [Music] [Applause] [Music] we were once Sinners and love the things of the world Amen you remember ah let me remind you some of these things you remember when you used to go to bars oh all these people are perfect nobody has ever gone to Bath you remember when you used to go in the Disco and they jump and dance and dance you were dead those were Graves you remember when you used to smoke you smoke one cigarette you smoke another one you remember brother when you used to go around in fornication and it looked like a simple thing like a normal thing it looked like it had no problems you know you just go out like the rest of them Mother of God pray for us but it says there's many people say that they have been raised but their life proves difference your life proves what you are when you're not around by their fruits you shall know them foreign thank God for the anti-message I was a son of a priest and the story my father was a priest in the Anglican Church I thought I was going to be a priest myself I was already preaching for two years since I was 13 years and 14 years I was preaching in the Anglican church because the bishop had brought me to the pulpit and I wanted to be like the bishop yeah that wasn't Bishop you know when he had that ring and he would give the blessing I felt like this was so powerful I would wear the rope and I did not ever think of something better but because I was a seed of God God brought me this message just like you and like you like you you were in those grave thank God for the end time message hey [Applause] National Spirits can hold us not even sickness the angel of the Lord tomorrow while there but the battle was in the cave to me this is not like it was figurative and the angel of the Lord came down while he was in that Grace and he told him hear me foreign foreign Lazarus Hallelujah was in the grave how many days that was too late and then some of you while I'm preaching you might say yeah I hear you preacher but my case I wish that somebody came like yesterday or the other day or yeah but now it is too late I've already done it no God Is Never Too Late I've had some people even say this message this is the right time for the message God is never late whatever happened in your life in the past yes God allowed it so they can prove to the Devils I can still take my child out of this Lazarus was in the grave like forever don't you worry Jesus has visited Our Generation again when Jesus visited Lazarus he came to his grace he found his grave ah people go back to the days of Lazarus no Jesus is he again and he found us in our Graves you visited us through this entire message he has come to Quicken here you should not have an excuse to remain in those storms and I'm telling you your brother shall rise again yes and some of you have even unbelieving parents unbelieving brothers and sisters and I want to say Amen your brother shall rise again your family shall rise again they might be dead in those storms it doesn't matter how bad their situation is when it comes by their way that angel of the Lord comes to where they are we are married No Grave can hold them yes I still believe that with all my heart I was in Nairobi Nairobi and my mother she had even disowned me when I believe this message he said I don't want to ever see you again hey this one sometimes you tell these stories it doesn't look like it is but I hope you Brethren will be spiritual enough to believe that God does Miracles when I arrived in the church I found my mother I didn't invite her I didn't tell her anything they were no longer talking and the pastor in that church preached Pastor that's why preachers let us preach and those demons which one to stop preachers from preaching let me tell you those as our other Graves yes I'm speaking that fearing because it's the word of God God has sent us to preach the gospel and that's what creatures do those and so that preacher preached and she started looking around when she turned like this she was like shocked to see me take me to the front I said oh my God and you know I took I took a hold of my mother and we walked slowly to the Altar and when we reached there I left Saturday and I ran back in my heart I was like the angel the Lord has arrested amen hallelujah amen God still does the same thing if you have Hallelujah I'm challenging you this morning to all of you have unbelieving friends and family yes something can happen they may be drunkards they may be in living a life of sin be out there in the world if you believe something and you ask God to do something right now God's Great will hold them no more will have no choice my mother gave her life to Jesus I am by selling the same woman who disowned me let me tell you God can do the same for your loved ones we live for it right now confess it right now yes while we remember the resurrection of Jesus out of the Grave God take your loved ones out of God's grace hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to God amen amen this is not just excitement this is the reality right now the angel of the lord your loved ones right now he says you are going to say testimonies you are going to hear testimony because that's what our God does he came to set those who are in prison free amen yes Hallelujah and right there said unto Jesus if thou Art's been here my brother had not died will ask of God God will give it to them my brother shall rise again [Music] mother said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the Resurrection on that at that last day now I'm not talking about coming out of the Grave we're talking about now I'm talking about now Jesus oh my God this is a this is a missile the message is there is something I'm coming through here now Jesus is not here in his physical form that we are saying that this is Jesus but you need to understand first of all who is Jesus and I want to tell you that will die as I already shortly for you here the end time message is Christo is somebody getting the revelation [Music] not Christ Cristo is the resurrection and the life no opinion so am I right to say it is the resurrection says we are not to come together to talk about the message we have not come here to talk about the message we have come together get in the oh [Applause] he said my brother had not died when Jesus and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said well have you laid him they said unto him Lord he said come and see where morning I believe this is whatever the believer ought to do this we don't need to behave like or act like holier than that I think what the preacher's talking about is for the other one um you're dead foreign foreign [Music] come and see my grave and Jesus weaked you know something about Jesus he always understands there's a song that some brothers or some people sang there is a storm Within Me rages I don't know if I remember the words very well it goes like this [Music] [Applause] it was against my soul Hallelujah and then the other words I don't remember but it says and then it ends like saying for you always understand never was quit loving me down [Music] your faithfulness amen [Music] our father always understands Jesus wept that's the shortest verse in the whole Bible he's a high priest s you may have backslided in some ways that's a grave but Jesus understands he has the power to take you out but first I want to show you he understands let them testify let them testify that Jesus loves us Hallelujah and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died whenever Jesus is going to do something he first waits for the critics to say something while I'm talking these words I want you to examine your life before Jesus does something he waits for the critics to say something somehow he enjoys that he enjoys that because when the critics speak it gives him even a better reason to act you know to show himself that is a living God he left the Romans imagine that they brought the whole Machinery of the Roman army Roma who saw them that day when they were bringing the sale and they were putting them and bringing the soldiers blessing them everywhere you know give them to some Lions to eat them they left them to do all that they could he left them to you know to to to ashame themselves so that he can move and the same way he left everybody to speak what they were speaking while he was getting ready to move you have to be in this condition dead stinking in order for his name to be glorified Jesus therefore again verse 38 groaning in himself coming to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it is taking away the storm beside Hebrew Master the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh is but he says for he has been dead for days you know I want to say to you Church a grave hero a cave and a stone upon it this man was really buried in there it was in a grave a cave-like grapes it does not matter what this grave of yours is it does not matter how your sin stinks it does not matter how far buried you are saying let me tell you as I was writing these few words here by inspiration I I kind of felt a nudge I know God is speaking to someone about you know something here this morning it does not matter how far buried I want to say Christ is here I know he's here through the message of the hour and he's calling out your your name yes if you feel that in your soul I'm telling you this morning you're calling out your name out of this mess you have no strength of your own to put life in your life again and I want to say yield to him and he is [Music] even though he was thinking even though he was in a cage but I want to say there were some good news Jesus was on the scene he had come to change the story no matter how deep it was Hallelujah no matter how covered it was Lazarus that grave cannot hold you oh my God Hallelujah Jesus say down to her yes you should see the glory of God if you believe my brother if you believe I believe sister father you are going to see the glory of God yeah by the end of this Easter meetings and you'll see the glory of God it is a sure deal God does not do half-baked things [Music] carry me all the way from Uganda to come and tell you nonsense I am not coming here to tell you my mind I prayed about this is the mind of God for the Savage and I'm telling you if you believe you are going to see the glory of God you have a choice to believe or not to believe but as far as I'm concerned I am going to believe and if you believe the professor is you are going to see the glory of God hallelujah amen just allow me to roll away this is what Pastor Manda is doing every time they are only removing the storm but you must believe hallelujah amen then they took away the stones where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes I hope I've rolled away the stones I hope we are rolling away the storms let us roll the storms off of this grave what is your grave this morning let us roll away I will tell you how you roll out with the the Stones by saying Glory hallelujah amen when um [Music] Jesus began to speak to us and he says ask what you win Hallelujah [Music] and as soon as the stone was rolled away Jesus lifted up his eyes and he said father I thank you though has hurt me and I knew that thou Hearst me always because of these people which are standing by uh I said that you know they may believe amen and when verse 43 and when he thus had spoken he cried oh my God this is not a climax he cried with a loud voice amen that same voice is here right now is the voice of Resurrection hallelujah amen is calling us out of our grave yes sir amen this is the same voice if Jesus did not say Lazarus would have come out of their graves every day would have come out of the Grave yes but Jesus was specifically but I'm here today I'm telling the same voices here which grave are you in Jesus is Calling You Yes put your name on it is amen how many I believe that oh my God Hallelujah man and he that was dead come forth he came forth I don't know about you but in our country this may not be so good to speak on the pool people let me say it in our country we have some people who practice witchcraft even here oh yes we are in Africa all right you know Africa and you know they can call out somebody from the grave and the person is already bound so he will just beat you like that foreign [Music] [Music] we are a group of people foreign [Music] and suffered in this condition and all hope is gone past three days you don't know what to do oh God help me oh but God is coming to help you right now Hallelujah and is calling you out of that grave sister you don't have to remain in that gravey unless it is your desire I'm telling you right now in this atmosphere unless it is your desire but right now God can do anything just before we close this service God can do something in your life yes I believe that with all my eyes whenever God comes down in a building whenever the atmosphere is Jesus is just about to do something I want you to watch the service I
