[47:58] you. Amen.
[48:07] I request uh brother Melon to come
[48:11] [Music]
[48:14] he had his testimony.
[48:17] [Music]
[48:27] God bless you
[48:29] church. Would like to testify to the
[48:31] grace of God. This testimony would have
[48:34] come last last
[48:38] year but I think because of
[48:41] time I would like my wife to
[48:44] come because it took
[48:49] God and her standing with
[48:53] me. The reason we would like to testify
[48:57] this as you'll see if it was not the
[49:00] grace of
[49:01] God would not have
[49:04] happened we are expecting much much
[49:08] more but would like to thank God for
[49:10] what
[49:11] [Music]
[49:14] he uh it was
[49:17] February as you all
[49:19] know and God opened a business
[49:22] opportunity
[49:26] It's not that we saved a lot of
[49:29] money or we planned about
[49:34] it. Just think of an investment which
[49:38] would need something like 15
[49:42] million but
[49:45] then you just get it simply like that.
[49:49] Someone gives it to you.
[49:54] Secondly, uh we got a land
[49:59] opportunity shortly as the was coming to
[50:02] an
[50:04] end. It would have been so
[50:07] difficult. I didn't see it when the was
[50:11] beginning. But somehow God made it very
[50:14] fast.
[50:15] And all I can say we thank God for that.
[50:21] Then
[50:23] also then also
[50:26] uh in our cell fellowship
[50:31] meeting by the grace of God,
[50:35] God has given us two souls.
[50:40] It is a great testimony if you know the
[50:42] value of one soul.
[50:45] Come again. It's it's a big testimony if
[50:47] you know what the value of a soul
[50:50] means.
[50:52] Imagine someone born Muslim
[50:57] and then he's believing the Lord
[51:02] Jesus. And then lastly
[51:08] uh shortly towards the end of the
[51:11] year as you all know we we we we got a a
[51:17] miscarriage.
[51:24] which
[51:26] is but for me God strengthened
[51:29] me and it
[51:32] confirmed it confirmed two years ago we
[51:35] testified of our daughter.
[51:39] Maybe people would not
[51:41] understand and God preserved her
[51:45] life because of this
[51:48] bloody
[51:51] stuff which don't
[51:54] match. So when that happened, it
[51:57] confirmed the great testimony which God
[51:59] some two years back and we are going to
[52:04] trust God
[52:06] again.
[52:08] And the child shall come
[52:12] again. God bless you so much.
[52:16] Amen.
[52:20] Amen. Let's give the Lord a mightand
[52:23] clap of praise.
[52:28] So this is another testimony
[52:34] says God bless you church. I want to
[52:36] thank God who protected us as we
[52:40] traveled to and from Nakuru
[52:42] international convention. We bring we
[52:45] bring you greetings from the brethrens
[52:47] there. We saw the hand of of God in
[52:50] those meetings.
[52:52] Sister Mary Omata and Sister Groot. God
[52:57] bless
[52:58] you.
[53:00] Amen. Brother Dan, you can come
[53:04] and brother Dan has something small that
[53:07] he wants to pass on.
[53:14] God bless you, church.
[53:17] Yeah. I wanted to read the Sunday school
[53:19] report.
[53:22] Yeah, we had 12
[53:27] children and uh we learned
[53:30] about the Lord's
[53:33] prayer in the book of Matthew 6 verse
[53:39] 9-13. We learned how Jesus taught his
[53:44] disciples how to pray. And so we learned
[53:47] we have to pray in such a manner.
[53:52] And uh the offeratory was uh
[53:57] 5,700. Uh the teacher was me.
[54:02] But the little information I wanted to
[54:04] pass to our parents and the little
[54:06] children
[54:09] uh in the book of
[54:13] Proverbs it
[54:15] says when you don't have a vision when a
[54:18] man does not have a
[54:21] vision he
[54:23] perishes and it also says again in the
[54:26] book of uh
[54:28] Proverbs that if you when you raise a
[54:31] child in the right
[54:34] way. They will not depart from it when
[54:36] they
[54:38] grow. So I encourage all our
[54:41] parents to make it a
[54:44] point. Yeah, we are planning also to
[54:47] maybe to adjust the time to favor all
[54:49] the parents and the
[54:51] [Music]
[54:55] children. We also encourage the parents.
[54:57] You can also attend
[55:00] [Music]
[55:02] We're also planning for a senior Sunday
[55:07] school for our youth like uh maybe like
[55:12] 13 years and above or
[55:15] 12 because we are we children or when we
[55:20] are
[55:21] children we are like a little
[55:24] tree. If you don't make it the way you
[55:27] want it to
[55:30] be, it will grow
[55:33] inhal and when you try to correct it the
[55:35] way you
[55:38] want, you'll end up breaking it.
[55:41] So as we are still young we need to be
[55:44] grow we need to grow up in the right way
[55:46] so
[55:47] that so that when they correct
[55:51] us we cannot that we cannot run away
[55:54] from the word of
[55:56] God. God bless
[56:01] you. God bless you so much brother Dan.
[56:05] Amen. So we'll give our offerings.

[1:12:57] us because I know you are
[1:13:00] prepared a table for
[1:13:03] us. I ask Lord even as we go into the
[1:13:06] word
[1:13:08] that you will give us a good
[1:13:10] atmosphere that everyone Lord will be
[1:13:12] connected
[1:13:15] to you
[1:13:16] Jesus. Father Lord, we started this year
[1:13:19] on the
[1:13:21] 31st with this resolution that you are
[1:13:24] all that
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:27] matters and we want to say you are all
[1:13:29] that matters this
[1:13:32] morning. You are going to take us
[1:13:34] through this year.
[1:13:36] You're going to take us through
[1:13:38] everything. It's going to be a year of
[1:13:40] success for
[1:13:42] us. It's going to be a year of victory
[1:13:44] for
[1:13:46] us. And that means there are battles
[1:13:48] that must be
[1:13:50] fought and battles which will be
[1:13:53] won because if you are on our
[1:13:56] side, who can be against
[1:13:58] us? Father, we appreciate you. We give
[1:14:02] you glory. We give you honor in the name
[1:14:06] of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:08] Amen.
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:15] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:18] Maybe we you can be seated for just a
[1:14:21] moment.
[1:14:24] I don't know maybe musicians can wait a
[1:14:26] little
[1:14:27] bit. I just want to welcome you to
[1:14:31] 2025.
[1:14:35] Our first Sunday in
[1:14:39] 2025. Praise the
[1:14:41] Lord. Praise the
[1:14:44] Lord. Did you eat a lot in
[1:14:49] 2024? Your amens are very
[1:14:51] weak. Praise the
[1:14:54] Lord. Amen. Amen. So this morning we are
[1:14:58] happy to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:15:02] I did not hear visitors being welcomed.
[1:15:05] I hope there are no visitors with us
[1:15:07] today. Anyone visiting for the first
[1:15:11] time, could you please lift up your
[1:15:14] hand? God bless you, my
[1:15:17] brother. Could you be by any chance,
[1:15:19] Brother Dennis?

[1:15:29] nice to see you, brother.
[1:15:31] uh brother Steven told me about
[1:15:34] you and that you would be coming this

[1:15:39] Welcome our brother
[1:15:41] Steven. God bless you.
[1:15:44] Amen. I think he's the only vista this
[1:15:48] morning. Amen. Or the only one coming

[1:18:51] all
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:57] that. So please come and be in that
[1:19:00] meeting. Our youth camp is beginning
[1:19:03] this
[1:19:05] Friday. This Friday. Amen. Unlike other
[1:19:10] days, unlike other camps, this this one
[1:19:12] we are going to begin, we are going to
[1:19:14] have two services on
[1:19:19] Friday. So that means we shall begin
[1:19:23] earlier. Uh the first service will be
[1:19:26] around um uh around
[1:19:32] 1. Let me just pull up the program here.
[1:19:35] Our first service on on Friday will be
[1:19:40] uh 1:45
[1:19:44] p.m. that is on
[1:19:46] Friday. So let us
[1:19:49] uh try our
[1:19:51] best to come
[1:19:53] tomorrow so that we can be able to
[1:19:55] prepare for
[1:19:57] that and then um of course we shall have
[1:19:59] it Friday, Saturday,
[1:20:02] Sunday and uh then we will dismiss on
[1:20:05] Monday
[1:20:07] morning. Uh we have a lot of speakers
[1:20:09] coming.
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:12] Um and uh we we are I believe that the
[1:20:15] Lord is going to give us a supernatural
[1:20:19] time. Amen. I believe I believe it's
[1:20:22] going to be a good time
[1:20:25] uh around the world with all the people
[1:20:28] coming. I have 33 confirmed to be coming
[1:20:32] from Nairobi
[1:20:36] already. They have even already booked
[1:20:38] the place where they will be staying.
[1:20:43] Are you enthused about this
[1:20:46] meeting? I believe God is going to
[1:20:50] move. So really, especially you young
[1:20:54] people,
[1:20:56] youth can. It is a sin. If you do
[1:20:59] anything on those
[1:21:03] days, it's not bad. It's going to be a
[1:21:07] sin which I don't know if God will
[1:21:08] forgive you for it.
[1:21:11] cancel everything
[1:21:14] else. Get leave days from your
[1:21:18] work. I if they can't
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:23] escape, but I know God will give you
[1:21:25] grace to get leave
[1:21:27] days. This is for the
[1:21:30] youth, the parents. It's all right. It's
[1:21:33] understandable. Like I know sister
[1:21:34] Stella has to
[1:21:36] go and be working somewhere those days.
[1:21:41] But you see those you young people,
[1:21:42] every one of you young people, I
[1:21:45] actually expect all of you to be here
[1:21:47] tomorrow. So we can plan and see how we
[1:21:49] going to uh do things
[1:21:52] on. So come and be here. Imagine I mean
[1:21:56] people coming from east and
[1:21:59] west coming from as far as Zimbabwe.
[1:22:03] from as far as Kenya from as far as
[1:22:07] America from as far as and you who is
[1:22:10] here you say I'm busy don't you see it
[1:22:13] is a big
[1:22:14] shame so cancel
[1:22:17] everything and come not only come but be
[1:22:21] a
[1:22:22] participant also this camp we are not
[1:22:24] going to allow those who have not paid
[1:22:26] camp
[1:22:29] fee including the members of the
[1:22:33] church you are going to I know many of
[1:22:36] you members have already done some
[1:22:39] pledges
[1:22:42] um many have done more than 100,000
[1:22:47] shillings but you find in your family
[1:22:49] you have people who are um
[1:22:54] several and the minimum that a person
[1:22:56] each person should pay is 50,000
[1:22:58] shillings
[1:23:03] So if you have members in your
[1:23:06] family that are 10 years and
[1:23:09] above each of those they have to pay
[1:23:13] that camp fee of
[1:23:17] $50,000. Amen. Now, if you are part of
[1:23:20] this
[1:23:21] church and you sincerely are not
[1:23:26] able to raise 50,000 for each of your
[1:23:29] family
[1:23:31] members, I'm requesting that you come
[1:23:34] tomorrow and see
[1:23:36] me. Uh we will make
[1:23:39] arrangements. Every member of the church
[1:23:41] should be in that camp.
[1:23:45] And if you you don't you know uh you
[1:23:48] know you don't announce yourself and
[1:23:49] then you just appear there you will be
[1:23:51] turned down and you'll feel
[1:24:04] bad. So you you have to come and you
[1:24:08] know let us know that you are not able
[1:24:10] so that we can make arrangements before
[1:24:12] time beforehand.
[1:24:17] Is that a man? Inform your friends to
[1:24:21] inform their friends to make sure they
[1:24:24] pay
[1:24:26] fee on arrival or rather to come with
[1:24:30] it. If they don't
[1:24:32] have tell them it is a must to inform us
[1:24:39] beforehand. Amen.
[1:24:41] You know we are trying to get the hall
[1:24:43] at Chamogo
[1:24:47] University. We have already secured
[1:24:49] Chamogo
[1:24:51] College but uh for the
[1:24:54] accommodations the the kitchen the
[1:24:57] cooking place areas but their hall is
[1:25:00] not very
[1:25:01] good. We are trying to get the hall at
[1:25:04] Chamogo University.
[1:25:08] That's so people will just be walking
[1:25:09] crossing. It's just almost the same
[1:25:13] place. Um so um uh I don't know
[1:25:17] something I wanted to say it just
[1:25:19] skipped my mind but what I wanted to say
[1:25:22] mainly is that um those people who have
[1:25:26] even you church members who have not yet
[1:25:29] registered you need to please
[1:25:32] register. Uh is it possible for you to
[1:25:34] put up that website or
[1:25:36] that show them how to do it?
[1:25:40] DV fellowship.org dvf fellowship.org
[1:25:44] and then you will see the link to touch
[1:25:46] and then you you get yourself
[1:25:48] registered.
[1:25:51] Amen.
[1:25:53] Get yourself registered.
[1:25:56] Uh the the hall we are get going to
[1:26:00] get has a
[1:26:03] limit. It has a limit of people it can
[1:26:06] take.
[1:26:09] So that's why we have to be very strict
[1:26:11] on
[1:26:14] registrations and the camp. We don't
[1:26:16] want people to o over flood
[1:26:19] us and and we are not able to hold to
[1:26:23] handle
[1:26:25] them and yet they have not paid anything
[1:26:28] for us to help to help us take care of
[1:26:30] other uh maybe a tent or
[1:26:35] something. As you know, we are always
[1:26:38] better
[1:26:40] organized, but this year we have been we
[1:26:42] have had
[1:26:44] challenges with our
[1:26:48] venue. But when you have a
[1:26:51] challenge, always know that the victory
[1:26:53] is going to be
[1:26:55] great. So I am under great
[1:26:59] anticipation. Amen. If you've not
[1:27:02] registered
[1:27:03] yourself, you can even do it right now.
[1:27:07] right now right on your phone is very
[1:27:11] easy. Uh if if you you go on that
[1:27:15] website or after the
[1:27:17] service you'll see any of the brothers
[1:27:20] here and ask them how can I register
[1:27:24] myself but I know many of you are
[1:27:27] already
[1:27:29] registered. So I like I said I also need
[1:27:32] your
[1:27:33] prayers straight after our youth
[1:27:37] come. That following
[1:27:39] weekend I've been invited to
[1:27:43] leader I could not turn down this
[1:27:47] invitation because it's a youth
[1:27:52] retreat. Anything youth I don't care
[1:27:54] where it is I
[1:27:57] go. and and so I know it's going to be a
[1:28:00] big
[1:28:01] sacrifice both in the flesh and
[1:28:04] financially but you pray for us. Uh
[1:28:07] Pastor Michael is preparing a youth
[1:28:12] retreat of a few days
[1:28:15] uh that following weekend of 19th.
[1:28:20] Amen.
[1:28:23] Um I don't know whether you remember
[1:28:25] this but uh on the Sunday next
[1:28:29] After
[1:28:31] that on the Sunday
[1:28:33] afternoon on the
[1:28:36] 26th we are going to have our usual
[1:28:39] business
[1:28:43] meeting. You give your
[1:28:46] offerings, you give your land
[1:28:51] funds. We want to let you know what it
[1:28:53] has done this past year.
[1:28:58] So that you can know and have a burden
[1:29:00] to give
[1:29:02] more and also for on our part. It is um
[1:29:04] it is a good to be good
[1:29:08] stewards and transparent to
[1:29:12] you so that you can know how much you're
[1:29:14] giving a
[1:29:17] blessing to the work of the
[1:29:20] ministry. Amen.
[1:29:22] And so the following
[1:29:24] week, that's the last week of
[1:29:27] January, we are hosting a brother Gary
[1:29:29] Walker.
[1:29:32] We shall have a bench with
[1:29:34] him. He has a very interesting
[1:29:37] testimony. And then we shall also be
[1:29:39] taking
[1:29:40] him to
[1:29:42] Karamoja. We have a convention in
[1:29:45] Karamoja in the side of
[1:29:47] Cotto and the side of
[1:29:50] Moroto. And after that on to
[1:29:53] Ethiopia. You can see the schedule is
[1:29:56] very very
[1:29:58] tight. Just keep me in prayers. Will you
[1:30:00] do
[1:30:01] that? Amen. And we want to thank God for
[1:30:06] the new
[1:30:07] year, the new year meeting we had
[1:30:10] here. The brothers, I'm I'm so delighted
[1:30:13] that God has given us many younger
[1:30:16] brothers that are on fire for God.
[1:30:21] you know that can
[1:30:22] stand you know in the ministry. So here
[1:30:26] at
[1:30:27] DVF we can never be
[1:30:30] hungry. Never be hungry because God has
[1:30:33] given us
[1:30:34] servants who will always serve us
[1:30:38] whether the pastor is not there or he's
[1:30:40] there is food that will be spread on the
[1:30:45] table. Amen. You know there are some
[1:30:48] churches when the pastor is not around
[1:30:52] the church is
[1:30:53] dead. Even sometimes it
[1:30:55] closes when he's around. Oh, everyone is
[1:30:59] on fire. I'm glad here. We are not a
[1:31:02] worship of a
[1:31:03] pastor. We worship Jesus Christ. And so
[1:31:07] whether pastor is around or
[1:31:09] not, the word is
[1:31:11] preached. Amen. Amen. So this past year,
[1:31:14] I appreciate all of you.
[1:31:17] who have really served in different
[1:31:21] capacities, both sisters, brothers,
[1:31:24] younger men, older ones, God bless you.
[1:31:28] And I say that from my
[1:31:30] heart. You have made the work of God
[1:31:34] easy. And those of you who have been a
[1:31:36] headache to
[1:31:38] us, may God help you this
[1:31:41] year to be better
[1:31:44] children so that we can serve you with
[1:31:47] joy in our
[1:31:49] hearts. Can you say
[1:31:52] amen? Sometimes you forget to talk about
[1:31:56] that. Praise the Lord. And um there are
[1:32:00] some who brought me some wonderful
[1:32:02] gifts.
[1:32:05] uh you know around Christmas
[1:32:07] time after Christmas, the new year. So
[1:32:11] really I I'm so happy. I say God bless
[1:32:14] you so much. Shall we stand on our
[1:32:18] feet? Amen. Amen.
[1:32:21] Uh brother Polycap
[1:32:24] um said something to me
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:29] uh this past week.
[1:32:33] He brought me a question.
[1:32:35] And so today I'm sharing on something
[1:32:37] that was inspired by his
[1:32:43] question. And before we go to the word,
[1:32:46] I have a letter
[1:32:48] here from Eagle Revelation Tabernacle

[1:35:56] see it. It was
[1:35:59] grace. It was
[1:36:03] grace that
[1:36:06] turn my
[1:36:09] heart to him. Oh, and
[1:36:16] grace, my fear.
[1:36:27] How
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:37] great are you?
[1:36:43] Holy I
[1:36:53] found now when we sing it now with me
[1:37:04] 1000 yes bright shining
[1:37:11] shining
[1:37:13] as the
[1:37:26] No.
[1:37:30] Oh
[1:37:37] go we
[1:37:42] we lift up your hands and sing
[1:37:44] hallelujah.
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:53] Come on, sing it now to him. To the lamb
[1:37:56] of God that was slain for
[1:37:59] us.
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:08] Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] Oh
[1:38:36] yeah.
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:43] Amen. Lord Jesus, we are now going to
[1:38:45] open the pages of your holy word.
[1:38:51] I ask
[1:38:52] Lord that you will you will take me
[1:38:56] aside.
[1:38:58] I am nothing Lord but a humble
[1:39:02] servant. Lord, who am I to stand before
[1:39:04] the purchase of your
[1:39:07] blood? I ask that Lord you'll have mercy
[1:39:10] on me and that if I found favor in your
[1:39:13] sight this
[1:39:14] morning that you will use me father to
[1:39:18] speak to your children and even my
[1:39:20] brother who is
[1:39:22] interpreting Lord as seen as saved by
[1:39:24] Christ. I pray that you'll just come and
[1:39:28] smile on us this
[1:39:29] morning that you'll minister to your
[1:39:32] saints and anyone who might be
[1:39:35] hurting or someone who might be in a
[1:39:37] situation where they need God to
[1:39:40] speak could be here or
[1:39:42] online. My prayer Lord this morning is
[1:39:45] that you will come, you will speak and
[1:39:48] we will leave here this morning
[1:39:50] rejoicing in our hearts saying our
[1:39:52] hearts were burning within us as the
[1:39:55] Lord spoke to us. Father, we commit the
[1:39:58] service into your hands in the name of
[1:40:00] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:04] Amen. while you take your
[1:40:08] Bibles. Chapter 2.
[1:40:13] Thank you, musicians. God bless
[1:40:21] you. Vers 14.
[1:40:30] Amen.
[1:40:31] Amen. And we are reading from 14 to 26
[1:40:35] and then we shall be
[1:40:37] seated. For you to follow the story
[1:40:39] properly, I'll read in Luganda first in
[1:40:41] English first and then my brother will
[1:40:43] read after me. Amen. What does it profit
[1:40:46] my brethren? Though a man say he has
[1:40:50] faith and has not works and have not
[1:40:53] works, can faith save him? If a brother
[1:40:57] or sister be naked and destitute of
[1:41:01] daily food, and one of you say unto
[1:41:04] them, depart in peace, be you warmed and
[1:41:07] filled. Notwithstanding, ye give them
[1:41:09] not those things which are needful to
[1:41:11] the body. What does it profit? Even so
[1:41:15] faith, if it has not works, is dead
[1:41:19] being alone. Yeah, a man may say, "Thou
[1:41:22] hast faith, and I have
[1:41:25] works." Show me thy faith without thy
[1:41:28] works, and I will show thee my faith by
[1:41:32] my
[1:41:33] works. Thou believest that there is one
[1:41:35] God. Thou doest well, the devils also
[1:41:37] believe and tremble. But with thou know,
[1:41:40] oh vain man, that faith without works is
[1:41:42] dead. Was not Abraham our father
[1:41:45] justified by works when he had offered
[1:41:48] Isaac his son upon the altar? Seeest
[1:41:51] thou how faith wrote with his works and
[1:41:54] by works was faith made perfect and the
[1:41:58] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:42:00] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:42:03] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:42:06] called the first the friend of God. You
[1:42:08] see then how that by
[1:42:10] works a man is justified and not by
[1:42:15] faith
[1:42:16] only. Likewise also was not Rahab the
[1:42:19] hallot justified by works when she had
[1:42:22] received the messengers and had sent
[1:42:24] them out another way. For as the body
[1:42:26] without the spirit is dead, so faith
[1:42:29] without works is dead also.
[1:42:34] Yeah,
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:16] Are you guarantee
[1:43:44] Okay. How many believe that there is one
[1:43:48] God? That when you believe that there is
[1:43:50] one God, you do
[1:43:56] good.
[1:44:08] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[1:44:09] speech.
[1:44:32] Mhm.
[1:44:35] Wow. Get a
[1:44:41] mask. Uhhuh.
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:45:23] Wednesday.
[1:45:42] Wow. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Please
[1:45:47] be
[1:45:49] seated.
[1:45:51] Uh is a brother Brother Albert here
[1:45:56] today. Oh, okay. So, saints, this
[1:46:00] morning I want to I say that this was
[1:46:03] inspired by
[1:46:05] brother
[1:46:09] Polar. He asked me a very interesting
[1:46:13] question and um I'll just go back to
[1:46:16] that question
[1:46:18] first and read it out to you.
[1:46:22] in the book um uh he said James 2:24
[1:46:30] um you see then how that by works a man
[1:46:34] is
[1:46:39] justified and not by faith
[1:46:42] only. God bless you pastor. What does
[1:46:46] this verse
[1:46:47] mean? Especially in quotes the wax
[1:46:53] So I did not tell him I was going to
[1:46:54] read that for the
[1:46:57] people but I think how many would love
[1:47:00] to hear the answer to that
[1:47:03] question. Amen. And so I thought the
[1:47:06] whole church would need would would
[1:47:08] desire to hear that especially I'm a man
[1:47:11] who preaches
[1:47:13] grace and sometimes when you preach
[1:47:17] grace it is very
[1:47:20] tricky if you don't understand or if you
[1:47:23] don't receive the revelation.
[1:47:27] Many people who preach
[1:47:29] grace, they go off and they now toilate
[1:47:34] every sort of things everybody
[1:47:38] does. Why? Because grace covers for
[1:47:40] those
[1:47:41] things. You see, you can go and live
[1:47:44] immoral
[1:47:46] life. Grace is enough. You can go and
[1:47:51] abuse, drink alcohol, and repent later.
[1:47:55] Grace, your works don't
[1:47:58] matter. You can dress any how you
[1:48:01] want. Grace, it doesn't matter. You
[1:48:05] know, you can, we've said here, sisters,
[1:48:07] you can make your hair any way you
[1:48:10] want. You see, now you see grace, it
[1:48:14] doesn't really matter. And um so you
[1:48:16] find that
[1:48:17] people think that grace is freedom to do
[1:48:20] anything they want.
[1:48:24] And yet that is not
[1:48:26] correct. That is not the kind of grace
[1:48:28] we
[1:48:30] preach. That is not the kind of grace
[1:48:32] brother Banham stood
[1:48:33] for. Brother Banham said we believe in
[1:48:37] grace, not
[1:48:40] disgrace. You see that grace which gives
[1:48:42] you the freedom to do everything you
[1:48:45] want is a
[1:48:48] disgrace. Are you hearing me? But we
[1:48:51] believe in
[1:48:52] grace. We believe it's not our
[1:48:55] works that can give us
[1:48:59] righteousness. You know there are many
[1:49:01] terms here we shall be able to talk
[1:49:02] about if the Lord gives us the
[1:49:05] grace and then you find that others will
[1:49:08] go that
[1:49:09] way but then these others will go this
[1:49:13] way. They will preach the gospel of
[1:49:16] works and you know works and works and
[1:49:19] works.
[1:49:21] Every time you come to church, they tell
[1:49:22] you how to make your
[1:49:25] hair. They make this message and they
[1:49:27] reduce it only to how to make your
[1:49:33] hair, how to dress. If you come dressed
[1:49:37] in a certain way, if you're not careful,
[1:49:40] they can even tell you go get
[1:49:43] out yourself first. This is a believer's
[1:49:47] church.
[1:49:48] We don't dress that way. We don't make
[1:49:50] our hair that way. Did you know in some
[1:49:54] message churches that if a sister plates
[1:49:57] her hair, they can actually kick her out
[1:50:00] of the
[1:50:00] church? Why? Because according to them,
[1:50:03] she's not done a good
[1:50:05] work. That is not allowed to be done
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:09] way. And they excommunicate them or they
[1:50:13] chase them out of the church. And you
[1:50:15] know we are so much
[1:50:17] obsessed that area that
[1:50:20] side that side they are so much obsessed
[1:50:24] with how long a girl's dress
[1:50:27] is or how short it
[1:50:30] is. You know every preaching every
[1:50:33] preaching will be about what you must
[1:50:36] do. What you must not do. What you must
[1:50:39] do. What you must not do. And until
[1:50:44] believers have become
[1:50:47] um um
[1:50:51] biased and they are biased with anyone
[1:50:54] who does not do what they do, how they
[1:50:56] do it.
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] If they feel for example that for
[1:51:05] them they are the ones doing it
[1:51:08] right. Anyone else is not a a a real
[1:51:12] believer and also they will they will
[1:51:15] always have that form of
[1:51:19] righteousness and they will always kind
[1:51:21] of have a feeling these are very
[1:51:22] important things I'm talking about. They
[1:51:25] will always have a kind of feeling that
[1:51:27] they are holier than anybody
[1:51:29] else. So there will always be deaconing
[1:51:34] everybody. You know even a new person
[1:51:37] has just come to church. They don't know
[1:51:39] what you believe. They don't even know
[1:51:41] baptism in Jesus name. They know nothing
[1:51:44] and a pastor is preaching on a on on
[1:51:47] grace. But as as he's preaching someone
[1:51:51] walks into the church dressing a trouser
[1:51:55] he will say now the Holy Spirit is
[1:51:57] leading
[1:51:57] me to go to the
[1:52:01] 22:5 a woman shall not wear
[1:52:05] bad you know and and then this woman is
[1:52:08] new to the church you be like this
[1:52:11] church is
[1:52:13] difficult they have a lot of
[1:52:15] laws have you had some such comments on
[1:52:18] the
[1:52:18] message they have a lot of rules they
[1:52:22] have a lot of laws why because the
[1:52:25] ministry has presented the
[1:52:28] message as being a legalistic
[1:52:33] message. This message is not a
[1:52:36] legalistic
[1:52:39] message. This message is much better
[1:52:42] than
[1:52:45] that is higher than
[1:52:47] that. So then what do we
[1:52:50] believe? So today I want to strike a
[1:52:53] balance between works and faith.
[1:53:01] And my title today is tangible
[1:53:04] expressions of one's
[1:53:12] faith. Tangible
[1:53:17] expressions of one's faith. Praise the
[1:53:20] name of the Lord. We will get back to
[1:53:22] James 2 at the
[1:53:25] end. But let me let us first read
[1:53:28] Ephesians chapter
[1:53:31] 2. And if you give me your univ
[1:53:35] attention, I believe the Holy Spirit
[1:53:37] will help
[1:53:40] us.
[1:53:42] Amen. Praise
[1:53:45] God. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace
[1:53:48] are ye saved through faith,
[1:53:54] by grace through
[1:53:56] faith, and that not of
[1:53:59] yourselves. It is the gift of
[1:54:02] God, not of
[1:54:05] works, lest any man should
[1:54:08] boast. For we are his
[1:54:13] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[1:54:16] unto good works.
[1:54:22] which God has before ordained that we
[1:54:24] should walk in
[1:54:28] them. So now someone can say
[1:54:31] ah James is saying we are justified by
[1:54:37] works. But Paul to the Ephesians says it
[1:54:40] is by grace through
[1:54:46] faith not of works.
[1:54:49] So then which one is the right
[1:54:51] one? They are both right. And I want you
[1:54:54] to understand today how both of them are
[1:54:58] right. Amen. And I'm going to begin with
[1:55:01] Matthew chapter
[1:55:04] 19. And I want to try and be as fast as
[1:55:07] I can
[1:55:09] uh because we have another service in
[1:55:12] ENT this
[1:55:14] evening. And those of you today who
[1:55:16] would be desire to go with us
[1:55:20] please it will be
[1:55:23] wonderful. Amen. So you can get a burden
[1:55:26] to pray for that work there.
[1:55:29] Matthew
[1:55:30] 19 uh chapter 19 verse
[1:55:35] 16 I want you to look at
[1:55:38] that it says and behold one came unto
[1:55:44] him and said unto him now he's coming to
[1:55:48] Jesus and he said unto
[1:55:52] him good
[1:55:54] master everyone say good
[1:55:57] Master, what good thing shall I
[1:56:01] do that I may have eternal life?
[1:56:07] Someone who is
[1:56:09] justified is a person. Today I don't
[1:56:13] want to preach as
[1:56:16] such but I want to say something which
[1:56:19] will stay with you
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:22] forever something which will
[1:56:24] revolutionalize the way you see the
[1:56:28] world and your attitude towards this
[1:56:32] message. Here is a man who is a
[1:56:37] believer. From the time he was
[1:56:40] born, he was raised in a believer's
[1:56:44] home. He was like brother
[1:56:46] Amram raised by
[1:56:49] believers, brother praise like some of
[1:56:52] you where brother Billy Paul prays in a
[1:56:55] believer's
[1:56:56] home. Amen. And he's a good brother.
[1:57:01] He's not worldly.
[1:57:03] is a good brother. So he comes to Jesus
[1:57:06] and he said to him, "Good
[1:57:10] master, what good
[1:57:13] thing shall I
[1:57:16] do that I may have eternal
[1:57:21] life." He was raised under the
[1:57:24] law. And the law was, you know, nothing
[1:57:27] but works, works and
[1:57:31] works. They were taught how to
[1:57:36] act, how to behave, how to talk, how to
[1:57:41] dress, how to do to relate with your
[1:57:44] neighbor, everything about good
[1:57:48] works, he knew. And he comes to Jesus
[1:57:52] and he felt his heart was still
[1:57:56] empty and he needed to know what good
[1:58:00] thing can I
[1:58:01] do that I might say now this is I I have
[1:58:05] it. I have it
[1:58:08] alive. I can feel eternal life
[1:58:11] tangibly. I have it. What good thing can
[1:58:14] I
[1:58:16] do? Amen. And he said unto him, "Why do
[1:58:20] you call me good? There is none
[1:58:23] good. There is none good." Tell your
[1:58:27] neighbor, "There is none
[1:58:28] good but
[1:58:31] God." There is none good but God. If you
[1:58:35] thought you are good, you are bad.
[1:58:46] You are actually
[1:58:47] bad. You are actually
[1:58:50] evil in the way you were born. The
[1:58:53] thoughts you have been having since you
[1:58:56] were born. You are trying and struggling
[1:58:59] and you think you are good because
[1:59:01] you're dressing better and you think
[1:59:04] you're better than the
[1:59:05] Catholic because you're dressing better
[1:59:08] and you think you're better than the the
[1:59:10] Anglicans because you're baptized in
[1:59:13] much water and you think you are better
[1:59:16] than the Muslims because you believe
[1:59:18] this and you believe that. Let me tell
[1:59:20] you, you are the same like
[1:59:23] them in that regard.
[1:59:26] You cannot be
[1:59:28] better because of a certain good work
[1:59:31] you have
[1:59:33] done. Now think about the good works you
[1:59:36] have
[1:59:37] done. Nothing among them can make you
[1:59:41] better. That is the truth. Can I preach
[1:59:44] the Bible the way it
[1:59:47] is? But he
[1:59:49] says there is none
[1:59:52] good but God. Only God is good. Only God
[1:59:57] is good. I'm emphasizing certain points
[2:00:00] here. Only God is
[2:00:04] good. That has two things. Number one,
[2:00:08] he says all human beings are
[2:00:11] bad. Number two, this man called Jesus
[2:00:15] good
[2:00:16] master. So Jesus is trying to tell him.
[2:00:19] So you you have you you should now know
[2:00:21] who I am.
[2:00:40] Jesus is God.
[2:00:42] Amen. Can you shout it? Jesus is God.
[2:00:47] And you know he was
[2:00:50] admitting. Yes, I'm good. And that is
[2:00:53] because I'm I'm
[2:00:54] God. But there is none
[2:00:57] good. Only God is good. And I am
[2:01:01] good. Amen.
[2:01:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But if you as a
[2:01:07] human being will enter into
[2:01:11] life keep the
[2:01:14] commandments. He said unto him. Which
[2:01:17] commandments? Jesus said, "You shall not
[2:01:20] murder. You will not commit adultery.
[2:01:23] You shall not steal. You not bear false
[2:01:26] witness. Honor your father and your
[2:01:29] mother. And you love your neighbor. like
[2:01:33] yourself. The young man said, "All these
[2:01:39] things I have
[2:01:41] kept from my youth
[2:01:45] up.
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:48] What? How do you How do you hear
[2:01:51] that? This is someone
[2:01:55] boasting. What did you say? I should not
[2:01:58] kill. I should not commit adultery. I
[2:02:01] should not steal. I should not bear
[2:02:03] false witness. I should honor my father
[2:02:04] and
[2:02:08] mother. I have done all those good
[2:02:11] things. He began
[2:02:13] boasting. I have done all those good
[2:02:16] things. I am good. I have what do I
[2:02:20] lack? I have done all those good things.
[2:02:23] The man began
[2:02:26] boasting. But Jesus was God. And Jesus
[2:02:31] is God. And he said to him, "If you will
[2:02:35] be
[2:02:37] perfect, go and sell everything you
[2:02:41] have and give to the
[2:02:44] poor that and thou shalt have treasure
[2:02:47] in
[2:02:49] heaven and come and follow me." Now
[2:02:53] remember, you know, we are learning. So
[2:02:56] I want you to keep your thoughts
[2:02:57] together with me.
[2:03:00] so that this service can be a blessing
[2:03:01] to
[2:03:02] you. I don't want to rush rush rush. I
[2:03:05] want you to
[2:03:06] understand what I am talking
[2:03:09] about. Amen. I appreciate your
[2:03:14] amen. It means you're
[2:03:17] following
[2:03:23] it. The young man said all these things
[2:03:26] from the time I was a youth. I have not
[2:03:29] lacked. I've done them. And Jesus said
[2:03:32] to him, if you will be perfect, go sell
[2:03:36] everything you have, give to the poor,
[2:03:39] you shall receive treasure in heaven.
[2:03:41] Come follow
[2:03:42] me. Do do you do you understand here
[2:03:46] that the man
[2:03:48] Jesus the man Jesus was very poor?
[2:03:56] I want you I don't know who is the
[2:03:58] poorest here
[2:04:00] but imagine the poorest among
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:04] us standing before you and he tells you
[2:04:08] sell everything you have you you have
[2:04:11] cars you have houses you have lands you
[2:04:14] have everything and they tell you sell
[2:04:17] everything come follow me you will
[2:04:19] receive treasure in heaven the heaven
[2:04:22] you have never seen
[2:04:24] the heaven you have even maybe never
[2:04:25] dreamed of and you are not too sure
[2:04:28] whether this one has ever been
[2:04:29] there and he's telling you just do what
[2:04:33] I'm saying sell everything come follow
[2:04:36] me sell everything come follow me but
[2:04:39] you see the first thing Jesus told him
[2:04:42] before he told him
[2:04:44] that is what this man
[2:04:50] missed the sermon that Jesus gave that
[2:04:54] man was not sell
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:59] everything. That was the second
[2:05:02] gospel. The first one was I am
[2:05:07] God. Only God is good. So if you're
[2:05:11] calling me good, it means I am
[2:05:14] God. Can God tell you
[2:05:17] anything and you refuse to accept it?
[2:05:21] Now let me ask you brother Alan if God
[2:05:25] speaks to you and he tells you to do I
[2:05:29] don't know
[2:05:30] what okay if he tells you to leave
[2:05:35] mine and remain unmarried
[2:05:39] forever can you
[2:05:44] accept the brother is shaking his
[2:05:47] head in disapproval.
[2:05:51] Well, he said like that because it is he
[2:05:53] knows it is
[2:05:54] me. So he's wondering is that
[2:05:57] God or is it the
[2:05:59] pastor? But if you know it is God, you
[2:06:04] would know he can create something else
[2:06:06] for
[2:06:08] you. If you know God tells you to do
[2:06:11] anything, you will do it. You will not
[2:06:15] question. You will not doubt. You will
[2:06:18] be like a crazy
[2:06:19] man. You will go for
[2:06:22] it. But the issue is, do you have a
[2:06:27] revelation of who God
[2:06:31] is? This man missed it because he failed
[2:06:35] to understand that Jesus was God.
[2:06:59] was okay. But he failed to do one great
[2:07:05] work to have faith in God.
[2:07:12] Praise God.
[2:07:14] Now I brought that example of that rich
[2:07:17] young
[2:07:19] man to demonstrate to us the
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:28] uselessness of our works before
[2:07:34] God. Now are you telling me it is okay
[2:07:37] for someone to murder to kill?
[2:07:40] No, it is not
[2:07:41] okay. But if you do, you do it according
[2:07:45] to the law, works of the
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:48] law, then it is
[2:07:51] useless. There are many people who don't
[2:07:53] believe in
[2:07:55] Jesus but they are good
[2:07:59] people. You preach to them and they say
[2:08:02] I preach to
[2:08:03] s me I don't I don't kill I don't go to
[2:08:08] this I'm a good
[2:08:11] person but they know
[2:08:13] them I never met such people
[2:08:17] yes they know they are
[2:08:20] good my
[2:08:22] brother your
[2:08:24] goodness God it is in vain
[2:08:30] The self righteousness is nothing.
[2:08:36] I know I'm I'm this is
[2:08:40] foundations and may God help us so that
[2:08:43] we can and you go back and listen to
[2:08:45] this sermon, you realize you missed a
[2:08:47] few
[2:08:48] things. Isaiah
[2:08:52] 64:6. Isaiah
[2:08:56] 64:6. But we are all as unclean
[2:09:00] thing and all our
[2:09:02] righteousnesses are as filthy racks.
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:22] Okay. Okay. You you you you interpret it
[2:09:25] from here. But we are all as unclean
[2:09:31] things and all our
[2:09:35] righteousnesses are as filthy
[2:09:39] racks. And we we all do
[2:09:44] fed as a leaf and our
[2:09:48] iniquities like the wind they have taken
[2:09:51] us
[2:09:52] away. We all are unclean
[2:09:56] things. Now let's take it in in its real
[2:10:01] sense. I by the way if you cannot come
[2:10:03] to God on this
[2:10:06] basis you can never be
[2:10:08] accepted by God. When you come to God,
[2:10:12] you must first see yourself as a man, as
[2:10:16] a woman of law estate.
[2:10:20] Yes. And I know all those scriptures
[2:10:21] that say that we are kings, we are
[2:10:23] priests, we are. No, no, that's another
[2:10:26] level before you get there. That's why I
[2:10:29] said these are
[2:10:31] foundations. You have to first
[2:10:32] understand the foundation.
[2:10:35] You see we are an unclean
[2:10:38] thing and all our
[2:10:41] righteousnesses are as filthy
[2:10:45] rags. You know all your dressing, all
[2:10:48] your talking, all your good behavior
[2:10:51] that you have done by yourself
[2:10:55] will is as filthy rags before
[2:11:00] God. It stings for God. He doesn't
[2:11:04] appreciate it. Does it mean God doesn't
[2:11:07] like good
[2:11:08] works? No. He's a God that is holy and
[2:11:12] he wants you to be holy, but not your
[2:11:17] holiness, not your
[2:11:19] works, not your
[2:11:21] righteousness. He wants
[2:11:24] his his righteousness his works, his
[2:11:29] holiness to fill you. And how does it
[2:11:32] begin to fill you? It begins filling you
[2:11:36] the moment you receive a
[2:11:39] revelation of who he is. The moment you
[2:11:42] receive the
[2:11:44] faith of the son of
[2:11:46] God. When Jesus came to that rich
[2:11:50] man, the man
[2:11:52] missed the
[2:11:54] revelation. What was the revelation?
[2:11:57] That Jesus is
[2:11:59] Jesus is God. That was a
[2:12:01] revelation. What is
[2:12:08] faith? What is
[2:12:10] faith? Faith is a
[2:12:12] revelation. Tell your neighbor, faith is
[2:12:14] a
[2:12:16] revelation. Faith is a
[2:12:18] revelation. Oh, are you now getting
[2:12:20] there? Are you about to get there? He fa
[2:12:24] the
[2:12:25] revelation. This man did not have
[2:12:28] faith but he had
[2:12:31] works. Selfmade
[2:12:34] works without
[2:12:36] faith. But you see if that man had
[2:12:40] received a
[2:12:41] revelation of who Jesus is, he would
[2:12:45] have said,
[2:12:46] "Amen. I receive what you just
[2:12:49] said. Let me set everything.
[2:12:53] And then he would have even done all the
[2:12:55] good
[2:12:57] works. Not because of his own
[2:13:00] goodness, he would not even boast about
[2:13:04] it. He would have boasted about the
[2:13:09] goodness of the
[2:13:12] [Applause]
[2:13:14] master. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are we
[2:13:18] about to get
[2:13:19] there? Keep building now.
[2:13:22] in the message letting off the
[2:13:25] pressure. Okay, I want you to listen now
[2:13:30] today. That is the refuge that we
[2:13:34] have. Look what
[2:13:36] happens when we are recognized when we
[2:13:39] recognize he
[2:13:42] Jesus was our substitutionary
[2:13:48] death. When we realize
[2:13:51] It is not our
[2:13:55] righteousness but his. And when we
[2:13:59] accept him as a personal
[2:14:05] savior. Now why do you need a
[2:14:07] savior? Because you are unclean
[2:14:11] thing because your righteousness is as
[2:14:14] filthy
[2:14:15] rags. I don't care whether you have
[2:14:18] never done any bad thing on earth.
[2:14:21] You still need a
[2:14:23] savior. Why? Because you are an unclean
[2:14:27] thing. Your righteousness are as filthy
[2:14:30] rags before
[2:14:32] God. So you have to
[2:14:34] realize he died for you. You have to
[2:14:38] realize, amen, it's not your
[2:14:42] righteousness, but his
[2:14:45] righteousness. And when we accept
[2:14:47] him as a personal
[2:14:52] savior, that's why we cannot accept
[2:14:54] Jesus as a group
[2:14:58] savior. You as an
[2:15:00] individual, you accept
[2:15:03] him by your own
[2:15:07] revelation. And you when you catch the
[2:15:09] revelation, you even cry, you say, "Oh
[2:15:13] God, I'm a sinner. I need you to save
[2:15:16] me. Then we go to the grave with him in
[2:15:20] baptism and we die with him. If you
[2:15:24] don't, you shouldn't be
[2:15:28] buried. So when you are dead and you
[2:15:31] confess your sins and and call yourself
[2:15:34] a sinner and ask for mercy and are
[2:15:38] buried with Christ in baptism, then we
[2:15:41] are also risen with him in resurrection.
[2:15:47] Praise the name of the
[2:15:48] Lord. Okay. Now let us take another
[2:15:52] corner here in
[2:15:55] Romans. We are going to go like
[2:15:57] that. And by the time we are done, which
[2:16:01] is not going to be very long from now,
[2:16:03] you will see it
[2:16:06] differently. Uh Romans chapter
[2:16:08] 3
[2:16:14] 27.
[2:16:15] Okay. What does it
[2:16:18] say? Where is boasting
[2:16:25] then? Few people are following
[2:16:28] right. Where is boasting?
[2:16:33] Then in other words, for you to
[2:16:36] understand what I'm I'm reading here, he
[2:16:39] says, "It is not your
[2:16:42] righteousness, it is his
[2:16:45] righteousness." You remember the rich
[2:16:47] young
[2:16:48] man. He had a lot to boast
[2:16:51] about. Ah, this one, this one, this one,
[2:16:54] I have done
[2:16:57] everything. What do I lack?
[2:17:02] He was a very good message
[2:17:07] believer. I have not
[2:17:10] fornicated. I have not drunk alcohol.
[2:17:13] I've never been in a dance
[2:17:15] party. I've never done anything
[2:17:18] bad. What do I lack? I was born in the
[2:17:22] message. I've done all I don't dress I
[2:17:26] dress longer skirts.
[2:17:28] I don't dress many
[2:17:30] skirts. I'm a believer. What do I
[2:17:35] lack? That attitude
[2:17:38] is
[2:17:41] self-righteousness. Jesus did not come
[2:17:44] for people like
[2:17:47] that. Let me emphasize it. Jesus came
[2:17:51] for sinners.
[2:17:54] Jesus come for somebody who realizes I
[2:17:58] am nothing without you.
[2:18:01] Everything I am, everything I have is
[2:18:05] all filled. I need you so I can become a
[2:18:10] real man, a real
[2:18:14] woman. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[2:18:18] says here,
[2:18:21] "No, where is boasting?"
[2:18:24] Then when you realize it is not your
[2:18:28] righteousness, but his righteousness, so
[2:18:31] you have nothing to boast
[2:18:35] about.
[2:18:37] Amen. It is
[2:18:39] excluded by what law?
[2:18:42] By what law? There are two laws.
[2:18:48] There is a law of the Old Testament, the
[2:18:51] law of works. And then there is another
[2:18:54] law of the New Testament, the law of
[2:18:58] faith. And then here he says, you don't
[2:19:01] boast. You don't boast. The younger man
[2:19:06] was boasting because of his good works.
[2:19:09] By what law? By the law of works.
[2:19:13] But here the Bible says where is
[2:19:16] boasting it is excluded. And then he
[2:19:20] asks a question by what law?
[2:19:23] Of what? Of what? Answer me. Of what?
[2:19:28] Paul says to the Romans,
[2:19:31] "No." Tell your neighbor,
[2:19:34] "No, but by the law of faith."
[2:19:40] Oh, we ought to shout, "Amen." Amen.
[2:19:44] But by the law of
[2:19:46] faith, verify, we conclude that a man is
[2:19:53] justified by faith without the deeds of
[2:19:58] the
[2:19:59] law.
[2:20:02] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:20:05] Oh my. In the message, the unconditional
[2:20:09] covenant that God made with with the
[2:20:12] people, he says, "It isn't whether I
[2:20:16] hang
[2:20:18] on or not. It isn't whether I hold
[2:20:23] out. It is whether he holds
[2:20:27] up. Whether he held
[2:20:30] out, there is nothing I can
[2:20:33] do. It is what he has done for me.
[2:20:37] What Christ done for
[2:20:39] me in God?
[2:20:42] Did you realize this is the message of
[2:20:44] the
[2:20:45] hour? This is brother Bam saying this
[2:20:49] word. Which message do you
[2:20:51] believe? Do you believe the message of
[2:20:54] grace or the message of the works of the
[2:20:58] Lord? Hallelujah. The law of faith in
[2:21:01] Christ has set me free from the law of
[2:21:05] sin and death. I have been
[2:21:08] liberated. I have been set free. I don't
[2:21:12] do what I do because I want to do them.
[2:21:17] I do what I do because I am a
[2:21:20] prisoner. I'm a prisoner. Since I
[2:21:24] received this
[2:21:25] faith, I have to do what I do. Why?
[2:21:29] There is something in me which makes me
[2:21:32] do what I do. It is not because I have
[2:21:36] the ability. I have nothing to boast
[2:21:39] of. I have nothing to boast of.
[2:21:42] Friends, there is nothing I can
[2:21:45] do. It is what he has done for
[2:21:49] me. What Christ has done for me in
[2:21:52] God. That's the reason I'm saved
[2:21:56] tonight. Yes, sir. Not what I could do,
[2:22:01] not by good
[2:22:02] works are we saved. But by his
[2:22:07] mercies, God has saved
[2:22:09] us. God has saved me in Christ. Amen.
[2:22:15] Hallelujah. My
[2:22:17] salvation came by
[2:22:19] one that is Christ. God has saved me.
[2:22:24] that he had a
[2:22:26] condute that he used that is Christ. Oh
[2:22:31] hallelujah. When Jesus died, I died.
[2:22:36] When Jesus was nailed to the cross, I
[2:22:38] was nailed to the cross. Everything is
[2:22:41] suffered. I suffered in him. My
[2:22:45] salvation was done for
[2:22:48] me by God. I was saved by God.
[2:22:54] in
[2:22:55] Christ. That's why I sing at the cross.
[2:22:59] At the cross, I saw the light and the
[2:23:03] burden of my heart was rolled away. And
[2:23:07] he says God has saved us in
[2:23:12] Christ, unconditionally.
[2:23:16] [Music]
[2:23:17] That's why if you are so
[2:23:21] overwhelmed by a life of
[2:23:24] sin, stop hiding
[2:23:26] yourself. Are you
[2:23:28] hearing? Stop hiding
[2:23:31] yourself. You You don't have to live
[2:23:33] like a hypocrite.
[2:23:37] Have they seen me? Are they seeing me?
[2:23:40] Have they known me?
[2:23:45] Why believers of the
[2:23:47] message think so much about what people
[2:23:51] think about
[2:23:54] them? If you are a
[2:23:57] drunkard, drink in the
[2:24:00] open. Stop hiding.
[2:24:05] I would rather have a
[2:24:07] church knowing they are all
[2:24:10] drunkards trying to get
[2:24:13] grace. If you come here in a church and
[2:24:16] you have a spirit of
[2:24:18] drunkenness and I know you a drunkard
[2:24:21] and you have told him pastor me I'm a
[2:24:23] drunkard. I need deliverance. I will
[2:24:26] prepare a good sermon for
[2:24:28] you and I'll preach to you until the
[2:24:32] grace of Jesus until the blood of Jesus
[2:24:36] washes and delivers you from the spirit
[2:24:39] of
[2:24:40] drunkenness. But when you hide yourself
[2:24:44] and then I come here and I preach, we
[2:24:47] are kings, we are priests, we are
[2:24:50] delivered, then you are going to hell,
[2:24:52] brother. You are going to hell, sister.
[2:24:55] Stop hiding.
[2:24:58] If you're an immoral
[2:25:00] person, come out. Declare you need
[2:25:04] help. Why? Because I tell you, brother,
[2:25:08] there is power in the
[2:25:10] blood. Power to save, power to deliver.
[2:25:14] It is not your
[2:25:17] works. Hallelujah.
[2:25:19] God has saved
[2:25:21] us in Christ
[2:25:27] unconditionally. We were
[2:25:30] Gentiles alienated from
[2:25:34] God, cut off without
[2:25:37] hope, without
[2:25:40] mercy. Christ in his sovereign
[2:25:44] grace died in ourstead.
[2:25:47] He died in mystead,
[2:25:50] taking our
[2:25:52] place. Let me bring this home. He took
[2:25:56] my place.
[2:25:57] He died for me. His sovereign grace. I
[2:26:02] was without
[2:26:03] mercy. I was without hope. I was an
[2:26:06] alien from
[2:26:08] God. But he saved me unconditionally.
[2:26:13] He did not tell me do this and I'll save
[2:26:16] you. No, he saved me without
[2:26:22] condition. Amen. He brought me in. No
[2:26:26] one can take me
[2:26:28] out.
[2:26:30] Hallelujah. If he saved me without any
[2:26:33] condition, there is nothing can take me
[2:26:37] out. There is nothing can take me back
[2:26:40] to the world. Satan has lost
[2:26:43] me
[2:26:45] forever. I am delivered. I am set free.
[2:26:50] He can save me to lose
[2:26:56] me. Do you realize what grace
[2:26:59] is? He saved you without a
[2:27:02] condition. He can't save you to lose
[2:27:07] you. He has everything figured out.
[2:27:13] Therefore, if you are a sinner, you
[2:27:16] simply come to him and tell him, "Lord,
[2:27:19] I am a
[2:27:21] sinner. Save
[2:27:23] me. Deliver me. The same grace that
[2:27:27] justified you, the same grace will
[2:27:31] deliver
[2:27:32] you." Amen.
[2:27:35] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:27:38] So he says, "So it is nothing we have
[2:27:40] done,
[2:27:43] nothing we could boast
[2:27:46] in." Paul said, "God
[2:27:49] forbid that he would
[2:27:51] boast save in the cross of Jesus
[2:27:55] Christ." Amen. Amen. In Christ, he
[2:28:00] boasted. I can't boast in
[2:28:03] myself. I can't boast in my strength.
[2:28:07] I can't boast in my
[2:28:08] holiness. But I will tell you what I can
[2:28:10] boast in. I can boast in
[2:28:14] Christ. I can't boast in my
[2:28:17] words. I am a weakling. I am a sinner. I
[2:28:21] have eroded many times. And I would yet
[2:28:24] er more, but I can boast in the blood
[2:28:29] which was shed for me. I can b in a
[2:28:33] finished work of Calvar's
[2:28:39] cross. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:44] Glory to God.
[2:28:47] So you now see in Romans
[2:28:51] 3 21 he says, "But now the
[2:28:57] righteousness of
[2:28:59] God, not my righteousness, but the
[2:29:03] righteousness of God without the
[2:29:09] law is manifested."
[2:29:13] meaning
[2:29:16] the New
[2:29:18] Testament bypasses the law
[2:29:24] and and it fulfills the
[2:29:31] law. The Lord
[2:29:33] said you should not commit adultery.
[2:29:39] So if they catch you they kill you. But
[2:29:43] here is what grace did through faith in
[2:29:46] Christ. He puts his law in
[2:29:49] you. When you receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:29:52] he says before you even do it, the
[2:29:57] moment you think it, he arrest you. So
[2:30:00] you find a brother crying, "Oh God,
[2:30:05] forgive me for
[2:30:07] lust." How did you know you have lust?
[2:30:11] The law of
[2:30:12] faith arrested you to help you fulfill
[2:30:17] the law of
[2:30:20] Christ. Amen. He bypassed the
[2:30:25] law to
[2:30:29] fulfill to fulfill his
[2:30:32] ways his his word, his holiness,
[2:30:36] even the
[2:30:38] righteousness of
[2:30:40] God which is now this is what I love
[2:30:44] most. Say the righteousness of
[2:30:47] God which is by faith.
[2:30:52] Let me see how you interpret
[2:30:53] this. Which is by faith of Jesus Christ.
[2:30:59] [Music]
[2:31:05] People missed that. Did you know that
[2:31:07] the
[2:31:09] righteousness of God which is by faith
[2:31:14] not in Jesus Christ,
[2:31:17] the devil believes
[2:31:19] in but he doesn't have the faith
[2:31:25] of you get
[2:31:27] it? Many people can believe in Jesus
[2:31:30] Christ but not all have the faith of
[2:31:33] Jesus Christ.
[2:31:38] It is not my faith in
[2:31:41] him. It is his
[2:31:44] faith in
[2:31:48] me even the righteousness of
[2:31:52] God which is by faith by faith of Jesus
[2:31:56] Christ to who? unto all and upon
[2:32:02] all them that
[2:32:06] believe for there's no difference for
[2:32:09] all have
[2:32:10] sinned and have come short of the glory
[2:32:12] of
[2:32:13] God but here now he brings
[2:32:16] up yeah he says being
[2:32:21] justified you remember what James said
[2:32:25] justified by the works
[2:32:28] But I will show you how this works out.
[2:32:30] Being
[2:32:32] justified
[2:32:34] freely by his
[2:32:37] grace through the
[2:32:40] redemption that is in Christ
[2:32:45] Jesus. I am
[2:32:47] justified
[2:32:49] freely,
[2:32:52] freely, unconditionally.
[2:32:56] freely
[2:33:00] freely. If we are to take the
[2:33:04] law, you know the law when you break
[2:33:06] one, you break
[2:33:08] all. If God is supposed to look at
[2:33:11] us through the works of the
[2:33:14] law, all of you would die
[2:33:17] now, including
[2:33:19] myself. He would have no
[2:33:22] church. But a gentile church
[2:33:25] is not sanctified or justified by the
[2:33:28] works of the
[2:33:30] law, but he's justified
[2:33:33] [Music]
[2:33:34] freely by his
[2:33:36] grace through the
[2:33:39] redemption through the
[2:33:42] redemption that is in that is in Christ
[2:33:46] Jesus who whom God has set
[2:33:50] forth to be appropriation.
[2:33:56] Jesus is the
[2:33:58] propation through
[2:34:01] faith in his
[2:34:04] blood to do what? Do you know what the
[2:34:07] word declare
[2:34:10] means? You know what declare
[2:34:13] means? If I say from today you will not
[2:34:17] be poor
[2:34:19] any have you done for that declaration.
[2:34:24] done
[2:34:29] nothing. Right now, let me show you what
[2:34:33] faith in his blood
[2:34:36] does to
[2:34:39] declare, his
[2:34:41] righteousness for the
[2:34:43] remission of sins that are
[2:34:47] passed.
[2:34:49] Amen. Hallelujah. He has declared his
[2:34:54] righteousness. Abraham, the Bible says
[2:34:57] it was not sin was not imputed to
[2:35:01] him. Righteousness was imputed to
[2:35:04] him. Meaning God
[2:35:07] declared that Abraham is
[2:35:11] righteous. You have been
[2:35:14] declared holy.
[2:35:17] This is this is where we want people
[2:35:19] with inspiration for
[2:35:24] songs. Write songs about that. You are
[2:35:28] declared
[2:35:29] holy. You are declared
[2:35:32] righteous. You are declared perfect.
[2:35:36] Now if you are not if you are not the
[2:35:40] declaration of the
[2:35:42] Lord cannot fall on empty
[2:35:47] ground. That's where you begin wrestling
[2:35:51] and fighting and saying Lord your word
[2:35:55] has declared me
[2:35:57] free I must be
[2:36:00] free. I must be free. I must be free. I
[2:36:05] must be rich. I must be holy. I must
[2:36:08] overcome.
[2:36:10] Amen.
[2:36:12] When he declared to
[2:36:15] Israel that I've given you the land,
[2:36:18] they had to fight for every
[2:36:20] inch of
[2:36:22] ground. Calb said, "Give me my
[2:36:27] mountain. I am still strong. I am more
[2:36:30] than able to possess it." And he fought.
[2:36:35] for every inch of
[2:36:37] ground. Now
[2:36:39] 2025, we are going to have tangible
[2:36:48] expressions of our
[2:36:58] faith. Amen. Amen. If God says you are
[2:37:02] holy, don't say I believe.
[2:37:05] the devil's
[2:37:06] belief. Express your
[2:37:08] faith by coming before his presence and
[2:37:12] say, "Lord, you declared unto me and you
[2:37:15] said I am free. Where is my
[2:37:20] freedom? Where is my
[2:37:22] deliverance? I must break
[2:37:25] loose from this demon. It cannot
[2:37:28] frustrate me
[2:37:31] forever until the bride
[2:37:34] Come to that place brother of saying
[2:37:36] enough is enough. Enough is enough
[2:37:40] and you become
[2:37:42] crazy and you become crazy and you say I
[2:37:46] am no
[2:37:47] longer a slave to fear. I am no longer a
[2:37:52] slave to immorality. I am no longer a
[2:37:55] slave to poverty. Until you come loud
[2:37:59] praise, you will remain the way you are.
[2:38:05] Hallelujah. Galatians
[2:38:07] [Music]
[2:38:09] 2 says,
[2:38:12] "Knowing that a man is not
[2:38:17] justified by the works of the
[2:38:21] law." It's a
[2:38:24] statement. A man is not
[2:38:27] justified by the works of the law.
[2:38:33] But by the
[2:38:35] faith of Jesus
[2:38:38] Christ, even when we have believed in
[2:38:40] Jesus
[2:38:41] Christ that
[2:38:44] we might be
[2:38:48] justified by
[2:38:50] faith, listen. By faith of
[2:38:56] Christ, not faith in Christ.
[2:39:01] by faith of
[2:39:03] Christ. I'm
[2:39:06] justified by faith of
[2:39:09] Christ, the faith of
[2:39:11] Christ. And not by the works of the
[2:39:15] law. For by the works of the law shall
[2:39:18] no flesh be justified.
[2:39:25] Colossians 2:20
[2:39:27] says, "I am crucified with Christ."
[2:39:31] Put it on your lips also. Can you say
[2:39:33] it? I am crucified with
[2:39:36] Christ. Nevertheless, I
[2:39:39] live. Come on, say it. Nevertheless, I
[2:39:42] live. Yet not
[2:39:44] I. But Christ liveth in
[2:39:47] me. Say it. Christ liveth in me.
[2:39:53] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the life
[2:39:56] which I now
[2:39:57] live and the life which I now live in
[2:39:59] the
[2:40:00] flesh I live. Oh my God. Oh my
[2:40:05] God. And the life which I now live now
[2:40:10] now which I live in this flesh. I live
[2:40:15] by the faith of the son of God.
[2:40:22] Hallelujah. The son of God who loved
[2:40:24] me and gave himself for me. I do not
[2:40:28] frustrate the grace of
[2:40:31] God. For if righteousness come by the
[2:40:36] law, then Christ is dead in
[2:40:41] faith.
[2:40:43] Righteousness did not come by the law.
[2:40:46] It has come by faith.
[2:40:50] of the son of God.
[2:40:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:40:57] The life I now
[2:41:00] live. Just meditate about those
[2:41:03] words. The life that I now live in the
[2:41:09] flesh. You know these scriptures that
[2:41:11] I'm reading
[2:41:12] today, it applies to those who have the
[2:41:14] Holy Ghost.
[2:41:19] If you don't have the Holy Ghost, that's
[2:41:21] why you don't understand what I'm
[2:41:22] talking
[2:41:23] about. But if you are filled with the
[2:41:25] Holy Ghost, you can
[2:41:28] testify. Amen. The life I
[2:41:31] live is not my
[2:41:34] life. Amen. I live by the faith of the
[2:41:38] son of
[2:41:41] God. Amen.
[2:41:44] Amen. Hallelujah. In the stage of a
[2:41:46] perfect
[2:41:47] man, he says if you die, you take the
[2:41:51] blood out of a
[2:41:53] man, you imbalm him. Trouble of it is a
[2:41:57] lot of them is is never got. You take
[2:42:00] the blood out of the
[2:42:01] man, he's gone. The only thing you do is
[2:42:05] put another blood back in
[2:42:08] him. He's going to live
[2:42:11] again. But he took his blood
[2:42:14] out and now we've put the blood of Jesus
[2:42:17] Christ
[2:42:20] in. And that brings the
[2:42:23] faith of Jesus
[2:42:26] Christ. Amen. Nothing but the blood. It
[2:42:31] brings the
[2:42:33] virtue. The virtue of Jesus Christ. The
[2:42:37] knowledge of Jesus Christ. The
[2:42:40] temperance of Jesus Christ, the patience
[2:42:44] of Jesus Christ, the godliness of Jesus
[2:42:47] Christ, the brotherly kindness of Jesus
[2:42:50] Christ, the love of God which is Jesus
[2:42:53] Christ. He is the head and he controls
[2:42:57] you and your feet is the
[2:43:02] foundation. Your faith. Amen. controlled
[2:43:06] by the
[2:43:08] head. The head is
[2:43:10] Christ. There you are. There is the
[2:43:14] perfect man of
[2:43:16] God. When he possesses these
[2:43:20] virtues, the blood shall be a token unto
[2:43:23] you, the Holy Spirit, the life in the
[2:43:28] blood is the
[2:43:32] token. Listen, listen. You go read the
[2:43:35] message the
[2:43:37] token but but we can just take a quote
[2:43:39] out of it. He says the hour is
[2:43:42] here when the token
[2:43:46] himself is
[2:43:49] identifying himself right among
[2:43:54] us and proving that he not you but he is
[2:44:01] the same yesterday today and forever.
[2:44:07] Amen. He's right with the word.
[2:44:11] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do
[2:44:17] you believe it?
[2:44:22] We believed it when the year was
[2:44:25] beginning. God filled some here. And by
[2:44:29] the way, if God filled you with the Holy
[2:44:31] Ghost,
[2:44:32] testify. That's what I believe.
[2:44:36] Testify. Testify.
[2:44:40] And when we were in the family
[2:44:43] altar, I witnessed God do
[2:44:47] something in my
[2:44:49] family. You know, as I was praying for
[2:44:52] someone, I don't remember
[2:44:54] who. Then you know these two boys were
[2:44:56] following me. You can say they're so
[2:45:00] young. But you see kept on following me.
[2:45:04] I didn't know. But after a while, I
[2:45:06] realized he was following me. And uh so
[2:45:09] he began nudging my left
[2:45:12] hand, pulling it, pulling it cuz I think
[2:45:15] he was realizing everybody was, you
[2:45:17] know, getting
[2:45:19] drunk and falling the other side. And
[2:45:22] so, you know, he began nudging me,
[2:45:24] nudging me. And so I turned and right
[2:45:28] there, I looked at him. As he looked me
[2:45:31] straight in the eye, this is a very
[2:45:34] curious boy.
[2:45:36] So he looked me straight in the eye and
[2:45:38] I looked at him and right there the
[2:45:41] revelation came. I asked him, "Do you
[2:45:44] want to be filled with the Holy Ghost?"
[2:45:46] He said, "Yes." So I said, "Lift up your
[2:45:49] hands." And I prayed for him that God
[2:45:52] would fill him. Touched his heart. And I
[2:45:56] said, "God, fill him with the Holy
[2:45:58] Ghost." He left me. You know, he was
[2:46:01] just doing like that. Well, I thought
[2:46:04] maybe he's copying others and you know
[2:46:07] you know but you know I realized after
[2:46:09] one hour he was doing the same thing
[2:46:13] shaking shaking shaking uncontrollably
[2:46:16] kneeling down lifting up his hands
[2:46:19] standing up doing the same thing. And so
[2:46:22] later on his mother came and you know
[2:46:25] like we are almost finishing
[2:46:28] praying our prayer was almost 5 hours
[2:46:31] long the whole time. And so this boy was
[2:46:34] still in that atmosphere and my his
[2:46:37] mother thought maybe he's also coping
[2:46:39] us. I signaled her no presence of the
[2:46:42] Holy Spirit. And you know I tried to
[2:46:45] call him so I can embrace
[2:46:47] him. And I tried to embrace him thinking
[2:46:50] maybe he's cold or something covered him
[2:46:54] called all his hands. He was just
[2:46:56] checking
[2:46:57] uncontrollably. What do you think that
[2:47:00] was? I believe it's the same same thing
[2:47:04] that John the Baptist
[2:47:06] received the same same
[2:47:09] spirit. You know he says when he fills
[2:47:12] you he shall quicken your m of body.
[2:47:18] And by the say sometimes he quickens you
[2:47:20] so much that you speak in other
[2:47:24] tongues. You see is a busting
[2:47:28] out is the spirit of God. It's a
[2:47:31] fire and you know this little
[2:47:34] one two years old. Well you can say
[2:47:37] maybe this one is a little
[2:47:40] big 2 years
[2:47:42] old. You know he came also following. It
[2:47:46] was around the same time. So I came to
[2:47:49] him and told him, Tim, do you want to
[2:47:52] receive the Holy Ghost? Because at that
[2:47:54] moment, the Holy Spirit revealed to me
[2:47:56] that if God was able to fill John the
[2:48:00] Baptist in the
[2:48:02] womb of the mother, he can feel a
[2:48:07] 2-year-old. Yes, he can feel a
[2:48:11] 2-year-old. Amen. And so by faith I I
[2:48:16] tried to lift up his hand and I told
[2:48:18] him, "Lift up your hands." So he lifted
[2:48:20] it up and I began praying for him for
[2:48:23] God to fill him. He jumped out of there
[2:48:26] so happy came praying for the
[2:48:29] mother. Pray for everybody. Let me tell
[2:48:32] you, brethren, the God we serve is a
[2:48:36] living God.
[2:48:38] [Applause]
[2:48:40] A man that says he's got a
[2:48:44] token, he cannot deny the
[2:48:46] word. Jesus is the same yesterday,
[2:48:49] today, and
[2:48:51] forever. The token has got to be
[2:48:54] applied. The token has got to be
[2:48:57] there. The blood shall be a token unto
[2:49:00] you.
[2:49:02] Now the Holy Spirit, the life that was
[2:49:06] in the blood is talking unto
[2:49:10] you. Get to it in a moment and
[2:49:14] see the Holy Ghost is the
[2:49:18] talking. The case is
[2:49:21] closed. The Holy Spirit is the talking.
[2:49:29] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:49:33] When the token is applied unto
[2:49:35] you, then you have the faith of the son
[2:49:38] of
[2:49:42] God.
[2:49:43] Amen. Now, as we are descending to
[2:49:46] finish in James, we go now to our
[2:49:50] scripture. Amen. Verse 14. What does it
[2:49:53] profit my brethren?
[2:49:56] Though a man say he has
[2:49:57] faith and he has not worked, can faith
[2:50:01] save him? If a brother or a sister is
[2:50:04] naked and blessed of daily food, and one
[2:50:08] of you say unto them, depart in peace,
[2:50:11] be you warmed and filled, not
[2:50:14] withstanding, ye give them not those
[2:50:16] things which are needful to the
[2:50:18] body. What does it profit? Even so,
[2:50:23] faith if it has not
[2:50:26] worked is that being
[2:50:30] alone. Being
[2:50:34] alone now. Let us stop right there.
[2:50:38] Which faith is he talking
[2:50:42] about? I believe he's talking about the
[2:50:45] faith of the son of God.
[2:50:48] And he's saying if you claim you have
[2:50:51] it and it oh my god and it does not
[2:50:55] produce the
[2:50:56] work you don't have
[2:50:59] him. If you have the faith of Jesus
[2:51:03] Christ you cannot have faith without
[2:51:08] works. That would be dead
[2:51:11] faith. The rich man was asked to sell
[2:51:16] everything.
[2:51:17] and follow Christ. He will not because
[2:51:19] he simply never had the faith of Jesus
[2:51:23] Christ, but he had faith in
[2:51:26] him, but he never had the faith of
[2:51:31] him. He saw things in the
[2:51:34] flesh, his own faith that was
[2:51:38] intellectual
[2:51:40] faith and it failed him. You remember
[2:51:44] Peter one time he also had that kind of
[2:51:47] intellectual
[2:51:49] faith and it failed him. Oh if everybody
[2:51:52] leaves you I will die with you and in a
[2:51:56] moment I don't know him. What was it?
[2:51:59] Intellectual faith. Oh brother oh
[2:52:03] brother sister. On the day of
[2:52:06] Pentecost the same man Peter received
[2:52:10] the Holy Spirit. And the Bible says the
[2:52:14] pillar of fire came down divided himself
[2:52:17] up and fell upon the disciples. One by
[2:52:21] one each of them received a portion, a
[2:52:24] portion of the fire, a portion of the
[2:52:27] Holy Ghost. And Peter, a man who was
[2:52:30] fearful, a man whose intellectual faith
[2:52:34] failed
[2:52:35] him. Hey, he now had boldness. He was
[2:52:39] speaking like a lion. And he told them,
[2:52:42] "Men and brethren, we are not drunk as
[2:52:46] ye
[2:52:47] supposed." This is that which was spoken
[2:52:51] over by the prophet Torah. This is the
[2:52:54] Holy Ghost. What happened to
[2:52:57] Peter? What happened to Peter? Peter had
[2:53:02] a different kind of
[2:53:04] faith. It was no longer the faith of
[2:53:08] Peter.
[2:53:10] Come on church. It was now the faith of
[2:53:14] Jesus in Peter. And now Peter could say
[2:53:19] the life I now
[2:53:21] live in the flesh. I live by the faith
[2:53:27] of the son of
[2:53:31] God. Amen. Amen. And Peter baptized
[2:53:36] 3,000
[2:53:40] on the same
[2:53:43] day. Your intellectual
[2:53:47] faith will fail you each
[2:53:50] time. Just receive the Holy
[2:53:53] Ghost. And if you don't have him, seek
[2:53:55] him. You shall find him. Blessed are
[2:53:58] they that hung and thirst after
[2:54:00] righteousness. They shall be filled.
[2:54:03] Yeah. A man may say, "You have faith.
[2:54:07] and I have works. Show me thy faith
[2:54:11] without thy works. And I will show
[2:54:14] you my
[2:54:16] faith by my
[2:54:18] works. In the message, the testimony
[2:54:20] raising a dead
[2:54:22] boy. Never did God do
[2:54:25] that. You show me your faith without
[2:54:27] your
[2:54:28] works. And I'll show you my faith by my
[2:54:32] works. And he says, you have got to do
[2:54:36] it.
[2:54:37] And you've got to fight for every inch
[2:54:40] of
[2:54:41] ground that you have. Every man in here
[2:54:45] that's born
[2:54:47] again of the spirit of God. Know that
[2:54:51] you've got to fight for every inch of
[2:54:56] ground. Listen to this one. Look. Look
[2:54:59] at this side. He says toy to
[2:55:03] toy. You have to fight, toy to toy with
[2:55:10] Satan toy to toy
[2:55:13] with Satan.
[2:55:15] Friends, this is not a
[2:55:20] picnic. This is a
[2:55:25] battleground. When you receive the Holy
[2:55:27] Ghost, you have entered the
[2:55:30] battleground.
[2:55:32] You are in the ring.
[2:55:37] The fight has just started.
[2:55:41] You are resting because it's no longer
[2:55:44] your faith.
[2:55:47] Now is the faith of the son of
[2:55:49] God operating in
[2:55:53] you. We never come here to eat
[2:55:57] cookies. We are in a battle.
[2:56:02] Amen. Faith is a revelation of the will
[2:56:04] of
[2:56:05] God. When his spirit is in
[2:56:08] you, he will give you
[2:56:11] revelation for what he wants you to
[2:56:15] do. It will not be
[2:56:18] easy ground. But this kind of
[2:56:22] faith, are you still listening? This
[2:56:25] kind of faith I'm talking about, the
[2:56:28] faith of the son of God knows no
[2:56:35] limitations. You stand toy to toy with
[2:56:39] Satan and you push him
[2:56:42] away from your
[2:56:45] ground from your
[2:56:48] ground. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many
[2:56:51] are doing businesses here?
[2:56:55] Lift up your
[2:56:56] hand. See all these hands here or people
[2:57:00] doing
[2:57:01] businesses. The moment you receive the
[2:57:03] Holy Ghost, God reveals to you by
[2:57:07] revelation by faith. It's a battle
[2:57:10] ground. Your business is a battleground.
[2:57:12] But you know what? God spoke to us at
[2:57:16] the beginning of this year that it's
[2:57:18] going to be a year of making
[2:57:21] money. You know why? Because if we make
[2:57:24] the money then we use to serve God and
[2:57:28] as the kingdom of God
[2:57:30] comes. Are you hearing me going to be a
[2:57:33] year of s financial
[2:57:37] breakthrough? Now you see that's why I'm
[2:57:40] preaching this
[2:57:41] today. Tangible
[2:57:44] expressions of your
[2:57:49] faith. Amen.
[2:57:52] The people in the world they go and
[2:57:56] sacrifice for their businesses. Do they
[2:57:59] or they they don't? They don't. Answer
[2:58:01] me. Do they or they
[2:58:03] don't? Have you sacrificed for
[2:58:06] yours or did you think we don't
[2:58:09] sacrifice? They took the the ideas of
[2:58:12] sacrifice from the
[2:58:15] word. It is God who requires sacrifice.
[2:58:18] So you see, but it has to be by
[2:58:22] revelation. It has to be by
[2:58:25] faith. When God came down and told this
[2:58:28] woman, go borrow buckets and everything
[2:58:31] and buckets and
[2:58:33] everything. Borrow it. Bring it here. If
[2:58:37] she has said, I don't have anyone to
[2:58:39] borrow. But first, I want you to see the
[2:58:41] principle. When something is revealed to
[2:58:45] you, don't hesitate.
[2:58:49] You don't even have to have anything to
[2:58:51] start a
[2:58:53] business. You need
[2:58:55] God. That woman had nothing. She was a
[2:58:58] poor old
[2:59:00] widow. How many know of the woman I'm
[2:59:02] talking about? But when Elisha came to
[2:59:04] her, he told
[2:59:06] her, "Go, what do you have said? I have
[2:59:10] nothing to go to the neighbors, borrow
[2:59:13] buckets,
[2:59:15] jars, everything you can get. Bring it
[2:59:19] here. It was according to her
[2:59:22] strength. It was according to her
[2:59:24] ability. She went and borrowed
[2:59:26] everything she can borrow. She brought
[2:59:28] it and a man of God prayed and oil was
[2:59:32] filled.
[2:59:37] Jesus told a rich man, "Sell everything
[2:59:39] you have." He refused to do it. He
[2:59:43] became poor. But the prophet told this
[2:59:45] woman, "Go bring everything you
[2:59:48] have. You can find bring it here." It
[2:59:51] was not
[2:59:52] easy. Who can borrow our poor
[2:59:57] woman? But she obeyed. Brother, when God
[3:00:00] speaks to
[3:00:02] you, obey.
[3:00:06] Obey in this church. We never pull for
[3:00:11] money. This ministry is not about making
[3:00:14] money. As I will show you in the
[3:00:16] business
[3:00:17] reports, we have made I have personally
[3:00:20] put more money in this church than
[3:00:24] anyone. You know, I give because it's
[3:00:27] the work of God. But I'm when when I
[3:00:30] come to preach about
[3:00:31] money, I'm telling you what I'm inspired
[3:00:34] to
[3:00:36] talk church. We should do we should stop
[3:00:38] being
[3:00:40] babies. How come God would speak to you
[3:00:44] about other things but when preaches on
[3:00:47] money you become
[3:00:49] cold. You give 1,000 in offering. You
[3:00:53] give coins in offering.
[3:00:56] You a believer and you're expecting big
[3:00:59] things. I told you the principles of
[3:01:02] becoming
[3:01:03] rich. Let us exercise them this
[3:01:07] year. Let us give and I would give
[3:01:12] ourselves and I meaning everyone
[3:01:14] including the
[3:01:16] pastor. You give not because you have.
[3:01:20] You give by
[3:01:23] faith. You do that business by
[3:01:27] faith, not with
[3:01:30] capital. Faith will bring the
[3:01:33] capital. The faith of the son of God can
[3:01:36] do the impossible things. Can do what
[3:01:39] man never
[3:01:40] expected. You live
[3:01:42] right, not by trying
[3:01:45] hard. I tried and tried. You live, you
[3:01:49] live right by
[3:01:52] faith. When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[3:01:55] he will help you to live right by
[3:01:58] faith. You progress in
[3:02:01] school not by wisdom but by faith. By
[3:02:06] the way, the faith of the son of God can
[3:02:07] move
[3:02:10] mountains. The faith of the son of God.
[3:02:13] His works are all tangible
[3:02:19] expressions of one's
[3:02:21] faith. Never do
[3:02:24] anything if it is not out of
[3:02:27] faith because there is no blessing
[3:02:29] following
[3:02:32] you. But if you take and
[3:02:35] give by faith, not because you have. I
[3:02:40] had someone say, "Oh, pastor, pray for
[3:02:42] me. I want I don't want to rob God this
[3:02:45] year. So I want him to bless me so I can
[3:02:49] give
[3:02:49] tithe. So the whole year you mean God
[3:02:52] has not bless you with
[3:02:55] anything. Are you here church? Don't
[3:02:59] keep quiet because I'm now talking about
[3:03:00] money.
[3:03:02] No, you who are robbing
[3:03:06] God tithe
[3:03:09] payers. You are robbing God.
[3:03:13] Even me I pay my
[3:03:14] tithe. You are robbing God. Someone come
[3:03:18] and say pastor let me give this one as
[3:03:20] the year is
[3:03:21] ending because this year I've not been
[3:03:24] given
[3:03:28] tithe is
[3:03:30] ti 10% of your
[3:03:33] income. It is not yours. It is the
[3:03:35] Lord's.
[3:03:37] You don't give because you have a lot.
[3:03:40] You give by
[3:03:42] faith. If you are giving land fund or
[3:03:44] youth meetings or anything you are
[3:03:47] giving, you give by
[3:03:49] revelation. God reveals to you, give
[3:03:53] this
[3:03:54] much. Many times when I've received
[3:03:56] great financial
[3:03:59] breakthroughs, I did things which shook
[3:04:03] me. Take a lot
[3:04:05] of money and give it to somebody.
[3:04:09] for their
[3:04:10] need and I'm not saying okay now God is
[3:04:13] going to give
[3:04:15] me I see the same
[3:04:18] measure and much more returning to
[3:04:23] me
[3:04:24] believers if we want to be able to have
[3:04:27] a year of
[3:04:30] success every one of us I teach even my
[3:04:34] little
[3:04:35] children to pay tithe
[3:04:38] These little ones, teach them, they know
[3:04:42] when they someone gives them money or
[3:04:44] something, 10% is
[3:04:47] off. Their mothers taught them that. And
[3:04:50] I emphasized it. They know it is for
[3:04:53] God. But you find a big man with
[3:04:56] beard, he still doesn't know. You don't
[3:04:59] eat
[3:05:02] tithe. You don't eat tithe.
[3:05:05] How many want to have financial
[3:05:07] breakthrough this
[3:05:08] year? Even me, I want to. Don't eat
[3:05:13] t. Don't eat tithe. Give it to the Lord
[3:05:17] and give as much as you give. God will
[3:05:20] pop back to you.
[3:05:25] Giving is a tangible
[3:05:31] expression of your
[3:05:34] faith. You live
[3:05:37] right. You do everything you do. Why?
[3:05:41] Not so you can go to heaven. But you are
[3:05:43] expressing your
[3:05:47] faith
[3:05:49] tangibly. A brother sister tells you I
[3:05:51] have no dress.
[3:05:54] You don't say God feel you, God bless
[3:05:56] you,
[3:05:58] God. When you hear when you hear such a
[3:06:03] thing, immediately ask yourself, what
[3:06:07] would you want me to
[3:06:10] do? Don't think about somebody, you
[3:06:14] yourself. And then sometimes the Holy
[3:06:17] Spirit can tell you give that one that
[3:06:20] dress.
[3:06:23] And the Holy Spirit shows it to you in
[3:06:25] your
[3:06:26] closet or on your anger somewhere and
[3:06:30] that one. No, no, no, no, no. Of course,
[3:06:33] this person doesn't know. But it is in
[3:06:36] your mind. The whole battle is
[3:06:37] there no no
[3:06:39] no. And the Holy Spirit tells that one.
[3:06:43] And at least let me give this one. He
[3:06:46] says no that
[3:06:47] one. Brother, let me tell you, you are
[3:06:49] blessed. If you ever have such a
[3:06:54] revelation, don't question
[3:06:56] God. Take it and give it to
[3:07:00] them and give it to them and you will
[3:07:03] watch and
[3:07:04] see. You will watch and see. Blessings
[3:07:07] always
[3:07:10] fall. Being a pastor of a poor church is
[3:07:12] very hard.
[3:07:16] I'm teaching you how to be
[3:07:18] rich so that I can be a pastor of a rich
[3:07:20] church.
[3:07:23] Amen.
[3:07:25] Praise God.
[3:07:27] So we can give and give until we give
[3:07:32] [Music]
[3:07:34] others. Now there's a very good
[3:07:37] opportunity. A young fellowship is
[3:07:39] beginning
[3:07:40] in we told you we want chairs.
[3:07:43] Everybody's
[3:07:45] dancing. This is a big
[3:07:48] opportunity. Big opportunity. Ask
[3:07:51] yourself what Lord what do you want me
[3:07:52] to do? What can I do? What can I do?
[3:07:57] What can I do? And when God speaks to
[3:07:59] you, you will be
[3:08:01] restless. This man is for my children's
[3:08:03] school fees. Said no. Give buy it for
[3:08:05] change. God can do that. Speak that to
[3:08:09] you. When we went to look for that
[3:08:11] place, I also went by
[3:08:15] faith because God began moving on my
[3:08:18] heart. I couldn't rest. I had to just
[3:08:21] go. So I have to get this place and then
[3:08:25] the rest God will do and we have the
[3:08:28] place there where children of God can
[3:08:31] come and hear the
[3:08:34] truth being
[3:08:36] preached. tangible
[3:08:38] expressions of one's
[3:08:45] faith. And as I'm finishing, he says,
[3:08:49] "Thou believest, there is one
[3:08:51] God. Thou doest what?" The devils
[3:08:55] also they do
[3:08:57] what? They
[3:08:59] believe and they do what?
[3:09:05] So if you're a believer, how many
[3:09:07] believers do I have
[3:09:08] here? I'm one of them. The devil is one
[3:09:12] of us. He's also a
[3:09:15] believer. So believing is not a new
[3:09:19] thing. Devils have been believers even
[3:09:22] before
[3:09:24] us. Your believing must
[3:09:27] translate into tangible expressions.
[3:09:34] The devil believes
[3:09:37] everything but he lacks one
[3:09:40] thing. One thing in
[3:09:44] life the
[3:09:46] works that area is
[3:09:49] dry. But when it comes to believe, he
[3:09:52] believes, he jumps, he
[3:09:56] shakes. Brethren, let us have the life
[3:09:59] of the world.
[3:10:02] Express our
[3:10:04] faith that the devil may see us and say
[3:10:08] those are
[3:10:10] believers. Those are
[3:10:12] believers. Praise the
[3:10:17] Lord. Amen. Now I'll finish with this
[3:10:20] with the last quot that I was talking
[3:10:24] about. James
[3:10:26] 2:20. But will thou overain man that
[3:10:29] faith without works is dead?
[3:10:32] Was not Abraham our father justified by
[3:10:35] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[3:10:38] upon the
[3:10:40] altar? Seeest thou how faith wrought
[3:10:42] with his
[3:10:45] works and by works was faith made
[3:10:50] perfect and the scripture was justified
[3:10:53] which is
[3:10:55] saith. Abraham believed
[3:10:58] God and it was imputed unto
[3:11:02] him for
[3:11:03] righteousness and he was called the
[3:11:07] friend of
[3:11:09] God. Yeah. You see then how that by
[3:11:12] works a man is
[3:11:15] [Music]
[3:11:16] justified and not by faith
[3:11:19] only. Now
[3:11:22] justification means to be declared
[3:11:29] righteous. Now we are not declared
[3:11:31] righteous by faith
[3:11:36] only. But by
[3:11:39] works of the son of
[3:11:43] god in us.
[3:11:47] uh in the Ban says the term
[3:11:51] works is translated from Greek
[3:11:55] argon which refers to deeds or
[3:12:00] actions in the historical context of
[3:12:02] James's
[3:12:05] letter. These would have been understood
[3:12:08] as the tangible expressions.
[3:12:21] of one's faith.
[3:12:24] The early Christian
[3:12:25] community, particularly those with a
[3:12:27] Jewish
[3:12:29] background, would have recognized the
[3:12:31] importance of living out one's faith
[3:12:33] through
[3:12:40] actions. As seen in the teachings of the
[3:12:43] Torah and the
[3:12:48] prophets, if you have the faith of the
[3:12:50] son of God,
[3:12:53] We will see it by the
[3:12:57] works. What are the
[3:12:59] works? Not mechanical things you have
[3:13:03] tried but the tangible
[3:13:11] expressions of your
[3:13:14] faith and your faith as we have
[3:13:18] seen. It's your faith in him.
[3:13:21] [Music]
[3:13:22] which will do
[3:13:24] what will make you receive the faith of
[3:13:28] the son of
[3:13:33] God. What is your faith in
[3:13:37] him? Is the
[3:13:40] revelation when it is revealed to
[3:13:43] you? Oh, I'm a sinner. I can do without
[3:13:47] you. I need a change. Lord, fill me with
[3:13:51] the Holy Ghost. That is your faith in
[3:13:54] him. And
[3:13:56] then the faith of the son of God comes
[3:13:58] out. When it does, that one knows no
[3:14:03] limitations. Then he will begin
[3:14:05] expressing
[3:14:07] himself, the works, the character, the
[3:14:11] nature, the the works of the Holy
[3:14:14] Spirit.
[3:14:16] Some of them will be healing the sick,
[3:14:20] raising the dead. Amen. Do you believe
[3:14:24] that? As musicians, come
[3:14:26] please. These are the works of the Holy
[3:14:29] Spirit. You know, we are at a time where
[3:14:33] the world is so
[3:14:35] hungry to see a living
[3:14:38] God. I want to see a living
[3:14:41] God. I'm tired of trying.
[3:14:44] I want to see him in
[3:14:46] me, living in me, accomplishing the
[3:14:49] things he said he would do.
[3:14:52] Amen. Amen. Let us stand on our feet as
[3:14:55] we give him a clap of
[3:14:58] praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:15:03] Praise the Lord.
[3:15:06] [Applause]
[3:15:09] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Has it
[3:15:12] been good to you,
[3:15:22] sir? You know, we talk about these
[3:15:26] things, but it has to come to a
[3:15:29] moment where you
[3:15:32] yourself find time with
[3:15:34] God and wrestle it out.
[3:15:39] is
[3:15:40] time for coming is just about to
[3:15:45] happen. We should do everything we
[3:15:49] can. Everything in this
[3:15:51] life, it will never
[3:15:55] satisfy. Nothing of this
[3:15:58] life will ever
[3:16:02] replace what we have done for him.
[3:16:07] The only things that you are that are
[3:16:10] eternal is what you do for the
[3:16:16] Lord. I don't know about
[3:16:18] you, but I want to live for him this
[3:16:20] year.
[3:16:22] I want to be most
[3:16:24] consecrated and I want to serve him
[3:16:27] selflessly as much as I have to live for
[3:16:30] my family, do this and
[3:16:32] that, but I want to live for the Lord
[3:16:35] Jesus and do as much as I
[3:16:39] can for the kingdom of God, for his
[3:16:43] work. That is an
[3:16:46] expression, a tangible expression.
[3:16:53] of my faith in
[3:17:01] him. I can
[3:17:03] [Music]
[3:17:05] hear my
[3:17:07] savior calling.
[3:17:13] I can
[3:17:16] hear my
[3:17:19] s
[3:17:23] calling. I can hear.
[3:17:29] [Music]
[3:17:36] Take thy
