thank god none of us got injured i just jumped off the the motorcycle then my sister remained with the baby but we didn't fall down immediately after we left his brother he just ran away and left us there i thank god because the devil wanted to kill us from where exactly we were testifying from that very place where we were i thank god for that then another thing it's about my son he has been

very well you know those days i used to sleep and you think i'm sleeping with a pig inside he could breathe very badly but i thank god my son is now very okay and the last testimony now we've been struggling with transport sometimes we miss the service because of transport means sometimes on wednesday when we finish the service late we sometimes we could walk up to home because we we are not getting the means to go but i thank god that he gave us a brand new motorcycle i blessed the name of the lord for that he has taken us from far no one thought this would happen because our beginning was so small but i thank god for the fires taking us may god bless you amen he's a miracle-working god praise the lord i'm so happy this morning see i was praying and i thank god like that god is in our midst amen [Music] this morning i was praying and i was asking god if you know me is where are you [Music] yeah we have to lift our faith and believe god for things bigger [Music] [Music] over the

over singapore now you are greater than them all you have now and that's why i have come here to worship you i want to lifted up [Music] [Music] just speak to him [Music] i wonder if you will just open your heart this morning [Music] [Music] you are now [Music] this is a question [Music] have you ever had an encounter with him what do you almost think would you desire to have it again if you have never had it you desire to have it oh yeah [Music] [Music] and i pray that [Music] m [Music] let us go to our bibles of faith [Music] i think just got straight away to the scriptures for now no is that you never tell everybody chapter three of the book of luke is and we read from verse 39. true and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying thus to thou not fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation does thou not fear god seeing seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the dear reward of our deeds but this man has done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise verily i say unto thee today shalt thou would be with me in paradise you can read that brother luca [Music] [Music] [Music] those who are here i just want to greet you in the name of jesus christ also on on the youtube now for youtube we send our greetings to you tomorrow to meet dave the lord bless you come on sir um and i pray that this morning that he will speak to us maybe to talk about later but this morning i just want to straight i feel too straight i'll go to the world in trouble and i'm speaking on an encounter with a living god [Music] an encounter with a living god canonical the gospel ng this is maybe for an inspiration is a destiny changer the gospel angel is a destiny change a true son maybe i'll not speak for long i do not know about something really on my heart on my heart to speak to you pray for [Music] it is not it is a story but more than a story that's why some people have not accepted in the existence of god because to them it was something that seemed impossible to them a spirit or something that could create something from nothing seems like a fable there is no proof to that fact because man was actually meant in the beginning to be in the image of god then i've got a seed a seed replace the seed to replace cane um who is it that saith was in the image of god of adam he says the anime defender nature adam that saith was begot that saith was in the image of adam and he says he had furniture sometimes and for a long time i've actually thought it to be that way that went your fault that because saith was in the image of adam now then says furniture adam and adam was in the image of god in furniture it was in the image of god that says they are in furniture but that would mean that every human being that is born is in the image of god adam was not in the image of god [Applause] he lost his glory [Music] no matter which family you were born because adam was not able to pass on the life of god to his children because he lost he lost that that life [Applause] destiny character of jesus and his destiny was changed permanently destiny means what happens in the future [Music] the thing that someone or something will experience in the future destiny means a power i'm again that is believed to control what happens in the future so you see that now when when adam was born in the image of god he had this power around him that was controlling what will happen to him in the future and that could not and of course i know there are people who believe that your destiny cannot be changed my new idea they're going to get sober at you i will prove that to you by the bible today actually your destiny can be changed by your actions to [Music] [Applause] you can open [Applause] group can be able to drive your you know well of course the destiny is something that will happen in the future i'm again the church in twitching over our muscle as much as we do not know what will happen and we say we have [Music] as the soul of the father so also it shall die the soul that sinneth amen it shall die so in other words the soul a man that decides to sin he is that soul [Music] please follow me here now look at verse 20. the sun shall not bear the iniquity of the father shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him yet so now the decisions that i make cannot listen please cannot necessarily mold the destiny of my children the things that your father did have been teaching together color code cannot determine your destiny maybe someone has sent home again the decision of someone else cannot influence your destiny it can frustrate your present time and he said that you got to change it because of those things already in 12 years someone else has gone on to yeah because they can make your life hard or want to be accused of you so can't wait to make your life easy oh it can you know try to change you a little bit during that moment now you cannot determine your destiny maybe someone has said a woman again ago cannot shape what you will [Music] because of what my mother did or what my [Music] the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him the he cannot judge you for someone else's mistake hallelujah amen the bible said we may not even know what we shall be bible again but we know you're two man when he comes why does the bible say happy righteousness that destiny is a power that is believed to control what happens a man is destiny can be changed in just a moment one moment i can say that i can change you at this point again again forever and the bible says i believe he died because the soul that sees that son shall die and of course death means a total separation from god and of course we know that the bible says one day he's like a thousand years unto the lord and one thousand years like a day unto the lord foreign and the destiny of all those can you know it cannot affect us that's just someone that took ourselves if we can be able to live without sin seeing not to wear our water but because the nature of adam anger will turn the water on down to us the fallen would not do any better much [Music] so amen another opportunity was made a reality on the cross when jesus was on the cross yes opportunity became a reality and so knowledge one encounter all this is in canada with that god nekotundo you one encounter all those things this man called jesus no montana it is one encounter oh christine cannot come with him can change your destiny because of his encounter with him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah here are three people on the cross why do we have until assad about three people on the cross the two were thieves another one was a good man he was this jesus we're talking about [Music] [Music] one encounter with [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is there is a problem somewhere why not why do you want to see what i want to yeah of course there are those who meet him why do you have a sinkhole and have an encounter with him never financing canada their life doesn't change [Applause] who was christian save yourself well call it and save us enough for to record this was the man on the left save yourself when you call it and save enough this man [Music] if this message is true [Music] does not know jesus that's a language on a limit of people whose destiny may never change of jesus oh they can say everything they want hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] is reason these people some of them believe the message because they never believed during the first place [Music] [Music] and forever and so this other man turns to this other man whom said you walk with the nature okay and he rebuked him now a true believer anyone who tries to talk the word in the same condemnation we are in this condemnation [Music] because we are sinners so it is just category to sunny day hellbounds sinful creatures can't you see the man we deserve it and that's how all of us were where'd your friend never dwell but this man naomi said you know has done nothing i missed karina the reason why jesus was chad was uh hungry on the cross because he died [Music] foreign jesus if you be the christ oh that's the crystal if you are anointed like they say you are already kind of dangerous save yourself save us he could he did not know if jesus saved himself yesterday we could not save them if jesus served himself yes he would not save you he had to take the condemnation belonging to you so that you wait the righteousness that belongs to you your way it was an exchange why did you say destiny and of course when he took the sins that belong to you it never changed his destiny maybe i chose him again because he was the destiny maker and so here he is on the cross and this man did not realize who jesus was yes and he still you know ridiculed him and needed anything he wanted to do become very strong but this other man you know good night this man recognized yes is peace hallelujah he knew that jesus had a kingdom yeah [Music] things of the world [Applause] he also [Applause] could you come he could not go to hell yeah something was boiling down one way listen listen this man homosexual wasn't even baptized is jesus christ amen amen your destiny is changed and forever [Applause] there was a man who was a good pharisee [Music] cross did change he said there's one more thing that you ought to do everything you are done that you'll never be ordinary come follow me [Applause] [Applause] he was [Music] it is fixed amen i want to follow your jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] feature and it was like as you you enter hell [Music] it was on the end on the uh on the like on the entrance [Music] it was a place that jesus went through fast yes to chair soccer kingdom and when he went into that place the bible says he led the captivity captain he led captivity captain hallelujah [Music] [Applause] jesus knew uh joseph [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he was the last one [Applause] amen this man hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah i am sure [Applause] hallelujah cows the saints they are no longer waiting in paradise did you know none of them is seeing jesus now what do you mean i am thinking of the rapture in our blessings [Music] [Music] [Applause] come on everybody now we're ready [Music] when [Music] when those who are dead in christ when they see us then we shall meet the lord i want to sing we are the last ones to come in father and then we shall see and your destiny cannot be changed by the by the fool that is something to do denominations no it cannot be changed it has to be changed you are not sometimes you are not something because you desire to be something you are something because you are something holy natural you are what you are oriented by the will of god don't get in the flesh talking it will never work abide where god puts you sight on the world many of us are in a place where god puts us back through the movie our destiny was changed i am again like a figure some of us would not have been here we gave up many opportunities many opportunities [Music] many opportunities financial opportunity a mix [Music] [Music] i remember when my brother invited me to do business he was just starting out [Music] and i had given him connections abroad they didn't know what they are to have whatever they were those were no more known to me than they were going to cover the other
