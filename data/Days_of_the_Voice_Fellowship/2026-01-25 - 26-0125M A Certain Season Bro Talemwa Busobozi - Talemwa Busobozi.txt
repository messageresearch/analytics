You deserve it, Lord. No matter what a devil tries to do, take all the praise, Lord. I'm a believer and therefore I'm here to worship you, Lord. I'm here to glorify your holy name. The devil will take no glory. He will take no praise. Because it all belongs to you, Lord Jesus. I worship you with all my heart. I worship you, oh God, from the bottom of my heart today.

You loving Jesus, &gt;&gt; we have come to your house today. because we are grateful &gt;&gt; when we see the battles you have taken us through that you have won for us each day of our life. We are here as a testimony that you are God and you are worthy to be praised. I want to give you all the glory Lord for what you have taken us through in the past year. And Lord, we have had sermons after sermons on this platform over the years. One year come and another year go. But you have remained faithful. Regardless of what we have gone through, Lord, you've not failed us. No forsaken us. Many a times, Lord, we failed you. We forsake you in our ways. But yet, you have remained faithful to the promise you've given to us. And Lord, we know we are your sons and you are your daughters. and you will not deny us but you will accept us in the glory and that's why we worship you and Lord as we have come once again to gather here Lord in your name I ask that Lord you will come and take control take control in each heart Lord maybe the hearts of those that are needy may they understand that this is the season of their breakthrough for Lord that you have allowed us to come in this place. We cannot walk out the way we can. Would you come Lord and take over the vessels for we are vessels of clay but use us Lord this morning and bless your people father once again. We commit every hearer, Lord, both here and elsewhere, everyone that is under sound of our voice this morning, come and overtake them, Lord. Overtake them, Lord. In Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Tell your neighbor good morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now &gt;&gt; let us uh uh have a seat. We'll sing a little song &gt;&gt; as we are going to have a brother come to dedicate to his brother come and dedicate their child. As they're coming, I want you to understand that this is a couple that have lost several children. We spoke about them in the youth camp, but you know, they have not ceased to worship God. They've not ceased to give themselves to the Lord. And regardless of what they went through, they kept on standing. They never looked back. And saints, I believe that's what it means to be a believer. Amen. And and so, you know, the brothers, the brother actually came with his wife at the camp. Can you please be still and know that I'm God? And you know, he came at the camp. And um you know, even when she was expecting just But I think that that was the best decision they made. And right there, you know, they were turned back because it was already very late. And that same night, my sister delivered. Amen. So really, this is one of the most precious baby that I have an opportunity to dedicate to. And let us sing this song as they come. Be still. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am God. &gt;&gt; Sing it with me now. Be still and know that I am God. Be still. I know that I am God. &gt;&gt; With every eye closed, &gt;&gt; they waited for a long time. through thick and thin. But the Lord never failed. Maybe one of you is waiting also. God will not fail. He will not forsake you for he promised you. I am the Lord that he waiting. Sing it by faith. The Lord that he live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So sing it one more time. Be still and know. Anyone who is waiting, &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just sing it. &gt;&gt; I want you to believe it. As brother Brian is having his child in his hands, so will you carry your fulfilled promise because the Lord never fails. Friends, there's quite a presence of the Holy Spirit here right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone better grabs that blessing. If you are waiting, be still and know that I am the Lord and I failed not. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; I am the Lord &gt;&gt; and I fail not. Still I know &gt;&gt; that I am God is still I know with every head bowed every eye for I am the Lord. Lord, I fail not. &gt;&gt; For this, even this shall be a sign to you. I am the Lord. I fail not. Wait upon me. I'll come even swiftly for I am the Lord and I fail not. Oh, thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us sing one more time. &gt;&gt; Be still. I know. If you think you've waited for too long, I want you to know that God cannot fail you. Just quiet and down and wait upon him. Be anxious for nothing. &gt;&gt; He will not fail you. Whatever your desire is, whatever your need is, for I am the Lord and I will not fail with every eye and head bowed. Look at this child. I didn't even know what I was going to preach about today. I didn't even know what I was going to preach about until early this morning at 3:00 a.m. And this child is called Mercy. Lord Jesus, you are here Lord. As we hear the cry of this child, it symbolizes life. While her brother and his wife had several children, Lord, and there was no life, they could not hear the cry of a baby. But Lord this morning you are confirming your promise that you are God of mercy. Lord Jesus that you have given them this child and this cry of life shows. Your promise is accomplished. And father Lord we take this child and Lord we dedicate this child to you &gt;&gt; back to you because you gave this child and we speak to the devil. You will not have this one. We surround his child with the blood of Jesus with the protection hand of Jehovah. Lord that you'll protect his child. Lord, you keep this child away from every spirit, away from every spell, away from every part of darkness, away from every spirit of death, away from every spirit of landia in the name of Jesus that this child shall be called blessed. And Lord, through this child, this family will always remember the mercy and the grace that you bestowed upon me and your grace and your faithfulness. Thank you, Lord. We pray oh God that the angel of the Lord will walk with this child from today and even forever more &gt;&gt; as we dedicate this child now to you &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Be my knowled Be still and th I am for I am the Lord that he better stand. Sing it from your heart now. &gt;&gt; Lord that. Hallelujah. I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; Saints, I'm going to speak to you this morning on a subject titled a certain season. I know that word certain can be taken for something, a season, a time like something. But also certain can also mean something that is sure, a sure season, a certain season. Whatever you you call it doesn't matter. You can say whatever That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us read in the book of John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Brother promise just continue on a little bit. Musician just continue a little bit. I think we are done with the singing but just I want you to just continue playing those chords for just a moment. Just slowly please. First John chapter 5. Just John the Gospel 5 1. to 9. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was not I was going to speak on something completely different and I have never I mean I I couldn't sleep. The whole night I was up because I felt that God wanted me to speak about something else which I did not know. And then this came to me about 3:00 a.m. in the morning. The whole revelation just opened up and uh so uh it's just one of those that I feel that will perhaps be a blessing to someone. Not much teaching but just encouragement. John 5:1-9. After this, there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Let us take it verse by verse. Now brother promise if you can go a little bit slower like reduce the sound. Now there is at there is at Jerusalem by the ship market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five portions. In these lay a great multitude of important folk of blind, hold, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. Everybody say waiting. Verses four. For an angel went down at a certain season at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water. Whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. a certain season. Now, let me read that again. He says, "For an angel went down at a certain season, not all the time. There was a certain season when the angel came down. a certain season. It was only a moment. It was a a small time that after the angel departed and the water was no longer trouble. If you did not step in, you missed your so and that's what we're talking about this morning. And a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, "Wilt thou be made whole? Ask your neighbor, will thou be made whole? So this service is for those who have been waiting on something from the Lord. And I have good news for you. And I'm standing here boldly because I know I heard from the Lord. And I'm here to tell you, this is your season. Hallelujah. Praise God. The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool. But while I'm coming, another step is done before me. Maybe it has happened to you for a long time. You feel like everybody around you is being blessed. But not you. But like brother Brian Brian, you will be able to say after this service, this is my season. Jesus said unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk." And immediately the man was made whole, and he took up his bed, and walked. And on the same day was the Sabbath, Sabbath means rest. Hallelujah. Today is the day of your now. I'm not speaking hypothetically. I'm speaking directly to you who God sent me to. This Please be seated. God bless you. May he bless the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A certain season. I'd appreciate if we can stay put and not do a lot of movements so that we see you see what the Lord has for you this morning. Amen. There's always at right time for things to happen. I'm talking to you. a believer, there's always a right time for the the the things to happen. In the message, the hour has come. The prophet says, "Now, maybe you don't believe that." You say, "Well, my faith is weak. I wouldn't confess it." Don't let the devil know that. You don't let the devil hear your doubts. This is a new year. We are starting a new season. We are starting a new phase. Believe it or not, you are not the man that you were last year. You are now in another season. If you stay in your past, the season will pass. Something is happening now. This is a season that you have walked in and you are not here by accident. None of us is. You see, you are now yesterday you were a day younger. Now you are a day older and after this service you will be maybe two hours older. So seasons change and they change fast. Every time a clock moves, a season is shifting. A season is changing. So if you stay in your past, IF YOU STAY in the troubles of your yesterday and you still think about LIFE THAT WAY, you are failing to realize the season you have walked into. I am one person who believes that every moment of my life that passes, amen, something is happening in my life. And remember, I know who I am and have walked here as a son of God to fulfill everything that was written about me. THERE IS NOTHING IS HAPPENING BY MYSTERY. FOR ALL THINGS WORK together for good. Amen. To me who love the Lord. And I know I am called according TO HIS PURPOSE. SO THERE IS A SEASON. BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN MY LIFE. That was a season FOR THE BAD THINGS. GOOD THINGS HAPPENED. BUT YOU SEE THOSE WERE GOOD THINGS OF YESTERDAY. BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING AGAIN that will will happen must HAPPEN because there HAS BEEN A CHANGE OF SEASONS. THE problem is many Christians, many believers don't discern the time, THE SEASON. WE ALWAYS LIVE IN THE PAST. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT your brother and you you look at him according to the past. What they did to you, what they say to you and and you know, RELATIONSHIPS ARE SPOILED. YOU KNOW, CONNECTIONS ARE BROKEN BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE PAST. BUT YOU NEED TO START LIVING IN THE SEASON THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU IN. YOU KNOW THE THE CONDITION YOU HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR A LONG TIME, THE DESIRE, THE NEED YOU HAVE BEEN WANTING OR HAVING FOR A long time. There is a change of season HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AMEN. I even HAVE A FEW TESTIMONIES RIGHT IN THE CHURCH. BROTHER BRIAN FOR ONE IS ONE TESTIMONY. How many years, brother? &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS. BUT YOU SEE AFTER THE THIRD YEAR THE SEASON SHIFTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you ARE IN DEBT AND SOME of you don't even THINK ABOUT PAYING. Listen to an instruction. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Begin writing down all the debts that YOU HAVE BECAUSE SEASONS ARE going to shift. Amen. Amen. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN JOBLESS FOR SO LONG. AMEN. SO, I'M JUST HERE THIS MORNING TO PRONOUNCE A SHIFT, A CHANGE IN a season. So, you better Amen. OPEN YOUR MIND UP AND BEGIN TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING IN THE REALM OF THE SPIRIT, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT. YOU WILL NOT ONLY HEAR A GOOD TEACHING OR GOOD PREACHING, BUT YOU WILL BEGIN TO ENVISION GOD has ever REVEALED ANYTHING TO YOU. AMEN. YOU SEE IT AS IF IT HAS HAPPENED. IF YOU'VE BEEN DESIRING A HOUSE, YOU WILL NOT BEGIN to dream OR TALK ABOUT IT. YOU BEGIN TO SEE IT. YOU BEGIN TO SEE WHERE YOUR BEDROOM IS. YOU BEGIN TO SEE HOW MANY ROOMS IT HAS. AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO ENVISION IT. AMEN. WHEN THE SEASON is right, &gt;&gt; praise the name of the Lord. So listen, he says, "When you say my faith is weak, I wouldn't confess it." And he said, "Don't let the devil KNOW THAT." HE didn't say IT IS NOT CORRECT. MAYBE YOUR FAITH IS WEAK, BUT DON'T LET THE DEVIL KNOW THAT. SOME OF YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN TALKING. WILL I EVER GET MARRIED? WILL THINGS HAPPEN IN MY LIFE? CAN I EVER HAVE A CHILD? CAN I EVER HAVE A HUSBAND? CAN I EVER HAVE A HOUSE? CAN I HAVE A BETTER JOB? YOU NEED TO BEGIN CHANGING THE WAY YOU ARE BEING TAUGHT. YOU KNOW WHY? DON'T LET THE DEVIL KNOW. YOUR weaknesses and YOUR DOUBTS. Always say, "I'VE GOT GOOD FAITH. I BELIEVE GOD WITH ALL MY HEART." DON'T TESTIFY NOTHING OF THE DEVIL. IT IS TRUE. THE DEVIL HAS DONE A LOT. BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT TODAY. LET'S NOT TESTIFY FOR THE DEVIL. WHEN THE DEVIL DOES SOMETHING BAD IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU TALK ABOUT IT, YOU ARE TESTIFYING FOR THE DEVIL. HELLO CHURCH. CAN WE TESTIFY FOR GOD? YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN BEFORE GOD DOES SOMETHING, AMEN. BY FAITH YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT HE HAS DONE IT EVEN BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES. AND WHEN you accept him as YOUR HEALER, DON'T NEVER ACT LIKE YOU ARE SICK. DON'T NEVER ACT LIKE YOU ARE CRIPPLED ANYMORE. BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HEALED. BEFORE YOU ARE HEALED, BEGIN ACTING LIKE YOU ARE HEALED. BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR BREAKTHROUGH, BEGIN ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE IT. BEFORE YOU GET YOUR JOB, BEGIN ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE A JOB. DON'T WAIT TO GET A A JOB TO BEGIN PAYING LANDFER TO BEGIN HELPING TO BEGIN DOING THINGS. BEGIN TO DO THINGS. AMEN. AS THOUGH YOU HAVE A JOB. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ACT LIKE YOU HAVE IT. ACT LIKE YOU SAVE. ACT LIKE YOU HAVE HEARD. AMEN. BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HEALED. TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD ALL OVER ON God and then not on you. As long as you take AS LONG AS YOU TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD, THEN THE WORD WILL PRODUCE WHAT IT PROMISED to do. Hallelujah. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAYBE YOUR FAITH HAS BEEN DULL AND DO. Let's try to SHAKE IT UP THIS MORNING. AMEN. YOU'VE NOT SEEN AND THEREFORE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING DOWN. BEGIN LOOKING UP BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID. THE PROMISES OF GOD ARE TRUE. AMEN. Now have faith. Believe him WITH ALL YOUR HEART. NOW JESUS here was speaking. HE SAID, "FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME. THE TIME HAS COME." IF JESUS WAS ME RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, HE WOULD say the same thing. FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING FOR? THE TIME HAS COME. THE TIME HAS COME. LET ME TELL YOU, EVERY TIME I SPEAK AN INSPIRATION LIKE THIS, I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN MANY TIMES. I PREACHED THE GOSPEL FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS. AND FRIENDS BELIEVE ME WHEN I GET AN INSPIRATION LIKE THIS I AM NOT JUST GIVING AN INSPIRATION OR OR RATHER a speak or speaking OR WHATEVER. IT'S A SEASON WHEN GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE. MAYBE NOT EVERYONE BUT SOMEONE. SO THIS COULD BE FOR ONE PERSON. IT COULD BE FOR TWO OR THREE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, IF THEY RECEIVE IT, AMEN, IT WILL MATERIALIZE FOR THEM. HALLELUJAH. FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME. THE TIME HAS COME. HOW MANY REMEMBER THE PROMISES God gave them? You have a promise from God. IF YOU have a PROMISE FROM GOD, SAY AMEN. HE SAID, "FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME." WHICH MEANS THIS TIME WAS APPOINTED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. A CHILD OF GOD DOES NOT WALK INTO AN AMBUSH. WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU, IT IS TIME FOR THAT. THAT'S WHY IN EVERYTHING WE MUST GIVE PRAISE. IN EVERYTHING WE MUST THANK GOD FOR ALL THINGS WE WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD. AMEN. BUT TODAY IS NOT A TIME FOR BAD NEWS. TODAY I'M SAYING THE TIME HAS COME. AMEN. IS A SEASON FOR GOD TO FULFILL HIS PLAN. AMEN. AND there is a seasons for everything. THERE IS A SEASONS FOR EVERYTHING. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT &gt;&gt; YOU SOW IN A CERTAIN SEASONAL THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SEWING IN LAND FUN FOR A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; CAN I PROPHESY TO SOME OF YOU? THIS IS THE SEASON. AMEN. THE TIME OF SEWING FOR YOU. AMEN. MIGHT HAVE BEEN LONG BUT IT'S A SEASON NOW FOR REAPING. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. YOU SOW IN A CERTAIN SEASON AND YOU REAP IN A CERTAIN SEASON. YOU'VE BELIEVED GOD FOR A LONG TIME FOR SOMETHING. THAT WAS A TIME OF SEWING. WHEN YOU BELIEVE GOD WITHOUT SEEING SOMETHING, THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE SOWING. AMEN. YOU ARE SOWING BY BELIEVING. AMEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BUT ALL YOU KNOW IS YOU BELIEVE HIS WORD. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A SECOND SEASON TO REAP WHAT YOU HAVE SOWN. IF YOU SOW FAITH, YOU REAP SOMETHING. IF YOU SOW DOUBT, YOU REAP DOUBT. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, and you reap in a certain season. AND THERE IS SEASONS WHEN THE TIME COMES THAT'S RIGHT FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN BROTHER BELIEVES IT THAT THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN. THEN THERE IS A SEASON WHEN THE TIME COME THAT'S RIGHT MEANING A RIGHT TIME FOR THE CERTAIN THINGS TO HAPPEN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? AND THE TIME CAME ONE TIME FOR GOD TO DESTROY THE WORLD WITH WATER. AND HE SENT A MAN BY THE NAME OF NOAH AND GOT THE WORLD READY FOR JUDGMENT. AMEN. AND TIME CAME FOR NOAH TO GET INTO THE ARK. LOOK, NOAH COULD NOT GO INTO THE ARK BEFORE God was ready for him to go. BUT WHEN THE SEASON CAME, EVERYBODY SAY, WHEN THE SEASON CAME, OH, I CAN'T HEAR YOU. WHEN THE SEASON CAME FOR NOAH TO GO INTO THE EARTH, GOD SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANYONE ELSE TO EVER ENTER WAS GONE BECAUSE THAT GOD HAD CLOSED THE DOOR. AND THERE IS COMING A TIME WHEN GOD IS GOING TO CLOSE THE DOOR FOR EVERY ONE OF YOU. A MAN SUDDENLY CAN SIN AWAY AT HIS DAY OF GRACE. If this is the YOUR DAY OF GRACE, AMEN. AND YOU DON'T RECEIVE IT, WHAT IS SIN? SIN IS UNBELIEF. WHEN GOD IS SPEAKING AND YOU BEGIN DOUBTING, THAT SEASON WILL PASS. AND YOU CAN NEVER GET IT BACK. SO I'M ENCOURAGING YOU, CHURCH. DON'T SEE THAT IT'S ME TALKING. IT IS GOD SPEAKING TO YOU BECAUSE IT IS YOUR SEASON. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. DON'T SIN AWAY YOUR DAY OF GRACE. And this man was at the pool of Bethesda. Amen. First John, we read John 5:19. Look at THOSE THREE VERSES FIRST. After there was a feast of the of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there at Jerusalem by the ship market a POOL which was called uh in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda. Now &gt;&gt; what is Bethesda? Bethesda means &gt;&gt; brother Brian Brian &gt;&gt; it means house of mercy. House of mercy or flowing water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive me for acting like a fanatic. Maybe I am. LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUR BETHESDA. BETHESDA IS A PLACE OF MERCY. WHEN YOU DON'T DESERVE SOMETHING, BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE TIME FOR GOD TO DO IT, GOD DOES IT. MANY TIMES WE THINK GOD WILL DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING. BUT CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING TODAY? LET ME TELL YOU, GOD DOESN'T DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING. GOD DOES SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS THE SEASON. AND WHEN THE SEASON HAS COME, NOTHING CAN HINDER IT. NOTHING CAN STOP THE MIRACLE. NOTHING CAN STOP GOD FROM MOVING AND DOING WHATEVER HE PROMISED IN HIS WORD. WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUR BASES. THE PLACE OF MERCY, THE PLACE OF FAVOR. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WOO. Let me tell you, I don't know where whether brother shame wants me to say this or not. I didn't even preach this because of that. I I wasn't even remembering. I just remembered it now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This young man has served God for A LONG LONG TIME. NO JOB. Even now, no job. So, I'm not preaching it because he has got a job. But then some time back years ago, God shows him in a dream. I want to show YOU HOW GOD OPERATES. GOD shows him in a dream. He's going to the state house. &gt;&gt; He's going with investors, big investors. And he is working with them. If you're working with big people and you working with big people, you you cannot be a small person. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so long story short, right now, he's moving with his investment. Very soon, now be careful. Be careful what I say when I'm on the pulpit. Very soon, we will be making prayers like God touch this brother's heart to support this project of the church. If you have known what I'm talking about, you know what I'm saying. What am I saying? WHEN YOUR SEASON HAS COME. AMEN. SOMETIMES YOU WILL SEE GOD BLESSING THIS ONE, GOD BLESSING THAT ONE, GOD BLESSING THAT ONE, AND YOU FEEL, "OH, GOD, WHAT ABOUT ME? YOUR TIME OF CRYING IS COMING TO AN END. WHEN THE SEASON IS RIGHT, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOMEBODY. IT'S ABOUT THE SEASON. SOMETIMES THINGS DELAY, NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE BAD, NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING BEWITCHED, BUT BECAUSE THE SEASON IS NOT THERE YET. BUT WHEN THE SEASON HAS COME, YOU HAVE ARRIVED AS YOU HAVE THE PLACE OF MERCY WHERE IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT WHETHER YOU DO GOOD OR BAD, WHETHER YOU QUESTION OR NOT. IT IS A SEASON &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO BE BLESSED &gt;&gt; AND IT CANNOT BE STOPPED. OH, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW REMEMBER, BETHESDA IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WAITED faithfully waited. NOT THOSE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE WORLD AND DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THEN THEY COME TO THE SEASON. NO, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AT BETHESDA WAITING, WAITING AT THE RIGHT PLACE. WAITING AT THE RIGHT PLACE, BUT THINGS ARE NOT HAPPENING. UNTIL SOMETIMES THE DEVIL CAN MAKE YOU DOUBT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. MAYBE THE CHURCH, THE ONE THE CHURCH I'M GOING TO IS THE PROBLEM. MAYBE MY FAITH. MAYBE MY PASTOR IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE. MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE MY CHURCH. MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE MY RELATIONSHIP. MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE THAT. BUT ALL THROUGH THAT, YOU WAIT AT BETHESDA. NOW TO YOU WHO WAIT AT BETHESDA, YOUR FAITH UNMOVABLE. THINGS ARE HAPPENING. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT YOU WAIT AT BETHESDA. WHEN THE TIME HAS ARRIVED, NOTHING CAN STOP YOUR PLEASURE. The revelation of Jesus Christ says it and they sing the song of Moses. This is Revelation 53 53. And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways. Thou king of saints." And brother Bam now asks us, just put up there quickly. Do you see it? The lamp. Everybody say the lamb. The high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy of our sins is the Lord God Almighty. That is his present office. Present is the everpresent God. Amen. Banam said present in 1950 60 whatever. is the same God. And I'm telling you, this is his present place. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Just hold it now. That is his present office. That that is what HE IS DOING NOW. Pleading his blood for our sins. BUT ONE DAY THAT LAMB WILL BECOME the lion of THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. HE WILL COME FORTH IN POWER and glory AND TAKE HIS AUTHORITY TO reign as king. He is the coming KING OF THIS EARTH. OF COURSE, THAT does not say he's not king. Now, for he is our king. He's the king OF THE SAINTS RIGHT NOW. It is a spiritual kingdom. It is not OF THIS WORLD SYSTEM. EVEN AS WE ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD, THAT'S THE REASON WE act different from the world. Our citizenship is in heaven. We reflect the spirit of the world uh of our rebirth where Jesus is the king. That's why our women dress the WAY THEY DRESS. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THEY DON'T dress a mini skirt, mini dresses, SEETHROUGHS, EARRINGS. THAT'S WHY OUR BROTHERS DON'T DRESS THE CHUPAS. WHY THEY DON'T DRESS THOSE SHORTS AND THEY GO AROUND TOWN? WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE CITIZENS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY WE BEHAVE THE WAY WE BEHAVE. NOT BECAUSE WE ARE UNDER RULES OR LAWS, BUT WE ARE CITIZENS OF ANOTHER LIFE. THAT'S WHY OUR WOMEN DO NOT DRESS IN MEN'S CLOTHING OR THEY DON'T CUT THEIR HAIR OR USE ALL THOSE COSMETICS AND THINGS THAT THE WORLD LIKES SO MUCH. AMEN SISTERS. THAT IS WHY OUR MEN DON'T DRINK AND SMOKE. AMEN. BROTHERS &gt;&gt; AND CARRY ON IN SIN. AMEN. OUR DOMINION IS THE DOMINION OVER SIN AND IT IS IN FORCE THROUGH THE POWER THAT IS IN the spirit of GRACE that indwells us. You ought to SAY AMEN TO THAT. EVERY KINGDOM ON EARTH IS GOING TO BE torn down. AMEN. BUT OURS BUT OUR KINGDOM WILL REMAIN. HALLELUJAH. THEIR CIVILIZATION IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED. THEIR KINGDOMS ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED. YOU MAY BE A NEW. YOU MAY BE YOU MAY BE WHATEVER. YOU MAY BE PF. I DON'T CARE. THOSE KINGDOMS WILL ALL BE DESTROYED. BUT WE HAVE A KINGDOM. WE HAVE A KINGDOM AND THAT KINGDOM CAN NEVER BE DESTROYED. IT IS AN EVERLASTING KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH TO SAY AMEN. I BELIEVE my God. &gt;&gt; Bethesa. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, &gt;&gt; I'll just read through it. Mark 9:17. And one of the multitude, one of the multitude answered and said, brother, let me just read through it. &gt;&gt; Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which has a dump spirit, and whatsoever he take, he taketh him, he teareth him, and he formeth and nashth with his teeth, and pineth away. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not. You You're prepared to read it quickly, brother. He answerth him, and saith, Oh faith, faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me. And they brought him unto him. And when he saw him, straight away the spirit tear him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed forming, and he answered his father. He asked his father, "How long is is it a go since this came unto him?" And he said, "Of a child, and often times it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. And if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us and help us." This is what the parent was telling the the father of the child uh the was telling Jesus rather. Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." And straight away the father of the child cried out and said WITH TEARS, LORD, I BELIEVE. Help thou my unbelief. When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dump and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And the spirit cried and ren him so and came out of him and he was one as one dead in so much that many said he's he's dead but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose. Can you read that brother? May God anoint you to read it well and read it fast. Number one. Amen. Listen verse 22. Now often times it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us and help us. Listen, what is compassion? You know the way the father described how this demon was tormenting his CHILD and then he ends it with saying if you can please have compassion. God does not do things for you because he feels bad about what you're going through. He has suffered a lot. Let me help you. He has suffered a lot because of that. Let me do something. Brother Brian suffered very much. Let me help you. Oh, you mean that he was waiting for you to suffer too much so he can do something for you? That's not compassion. God is compassion. But the Bible says his compassion for you now. HE ALWAYS HAS COMPASSION. BUT YOU SEE HIS COMPASSION THEY FAIL NOT WHICH MEANS WHEN GOD HAS COMPASSION ON YOU CAN'T FAIL TO TAKE YOU OUT OF YOUR SITUATION. BUT NOW LISTEN. WHAT KIND OF COMPASSION? AFTER THIS MAN EXPLAINED EVERYTHING ACTUALLY WHILE HE WAS TALKING, THE CHILD WAS SMITTEN AND HE BEGAN FORMING and biting his tongue, you know, like how those things, you know, HOW THEY BEHAVE. And and WHEN JESUS SAW THAT, HE WASN'T MOVED. HE KNEW. HE KNEW BEFORE THAT CHILD WAS BORN THAT THAT CHILD WAS SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH THAT. SO, DID GOD HAVE COMPASSION OR NOT? &gt;&gt; YES. HIS COMPASSION FAIL. BUT WHY DID HE LET IT HAPPEN? HE LET IT HAPPEN BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A CERTAIN SEASON WHERE HE, &gt;&gt; THE MASTER OF THE WIND, THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, THE ONE THAT STEALS THE STORM THAT WOULD COME ON THE SCENE. THAT NOW MY FRIEND WOULD BE A CERTAIN SEASON. AMEN. A SEASON WHERE GOD WOULD HAVE TO HEAL THIS BOY. YOU KNOW THE FATHER BEGAN EXPLAINING THE FATHER WAS JUST WASTING HIS TIME. WHETHER HE EXPLAINED OR NOT THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS BEFORE WE PRAY HE KNOWS WHAT WE HAVE MADE ON BEFORE WE PRAY. SO WHY DO WE PRAY SOMETIMES AND THINGS WE HAVE PRAYED FOR WE DON'T RECEIVE ANSWERS. WE THINK WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANSWERS BUT HE PROMISING HIS WORD THAT WHEN WE PRAY HE WILL ANSWER. SO WHY DON'T WE APPARENTLY THINK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED ANSWERS. The season is not yet. HALLELUJAH. WHAT ARE HIS COMPASSIONS? THE COMPASSION OF GOD IS THE will of God. HALLELUJAH. THE MAN SAID, "I BELIEVE HELP MY ARMIES." SO, DID HE BELIEVE OR NOT? HE DID HAVE FAITH, BUT IT WAS THE SEASON FOR GOD TO MOVE ON THE SCENE AND HE HEALED HIS CHILD. AND THAT'S WHY JESUS TOOK HIM BY THE HANDS and he lifted him and he arose after casting out THAT SPIRIT is the same Jesus today. The difference is in two feet. He's in two feet. He's in you and me. So when the season is right, &gt;&gt; that spirit cannot stay in there. That demon cannot STAY IN THERE. HALLELUJAH. But the problem with us, WE GIVE UP TOO SOON. WE GIVE UP TOO FAST. MAYBE MY CHURCH IS THE PROBLEM. MAYBE THIS PASTOR is not anointed. Maybe maybe these people are the problem. Maybe the church is the problem because it's not looking so beautiful. Maybe that, MAYBE THIS. MY FRIEND, LISTEN. IF YOU ARE STANDING IN THE WORD, EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. WHEN YOU PRAY FOR SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, IT'S NOT BECAUSE GOD HAS NOT ANSWERED YOU, FRIEND. IT IS BECAUSE THE SEASON IS NOT YET. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE SEASON IS RIGHT, HIS compassions fail. Let me prove that to you. I just want you to get into this with me and then you will see what will happen to you. In 1965, brother Bannam preached a sermon and he titled it this day this scripture is fulfilled. And listen to what he said. He went into the temple. We called him a meek man. He was but many times we misunderstand what meekness is. He was A MAN OF COMPASSION BUT YET we fail to sometimes to understand what compassion is. HE SAYS COMPASSION is not human sympathy. BUT COMPASSION IS DOING THE WILL OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HE PASSED THROUGH THE POOL OF BETHESDA. THERE ARE LAID PEOPLE. MULTITUDES OF MULTITUDES IS NO CERTAIN NUMBER. THE LAME, the blind, THE WHOLE, THE WITHERED. AND HE HAD COMPASSION ON THE PEOPLE ALWAYS. And he went to one PERSON that was not lame, blind, not whole, NOT WITHERED. MAYBE HE HAD A PROSTATE TROUBLE. MAYBE HE HAD SOME LITTLE INFIRMITY THAT WAS He had had it for 38 years. IT WAS NOT GOING TO BOTHER HIM. IT WAS NOT GOING TO KILL HIM. HE WAS LYING ON A PALLET FOR 38 YEARS. SO HE WASN'T A A VERY EMERGENCY CASE. YOU COULD LIVE WITH IT. BUT WHEN HE THE MASTER CAME, HE PASSED THE LENGTH, THE HO, THE WITHERED, AND HE PASSED ALL OF THEM. YET HE HAD COMPASSION FOR ALL OF THEM. ANSWER ME, MY SISTER. WHY DIDN'T HE HEAL ALL OF THEM? YET IS A A A MAN OF COMPASSION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR SEASON. IT WAS NOT THEIR TIME. IT WAS NOT THE WILL OF GOD FOR HIM TO HEAL THEM. HE HAD COME FOR ONE MAN LYING ON A PALACE. HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. IT WAS A SEASONAL, A CERTAIN SEASON FOR THIS MAN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And he said wilt thou be made home. And the man said, I have nobody to put in the water. Put him in the water. But while I'm coming where someone steps down ahead of SO YOU COULD WALK, HE COULD SEE. He could get around, but he was feeble. Maybe that is you. It's not that you, no one may even know what you're going through. But when you are suffering, going through something for many years, you're just fe and you have owned it. me gave up. No one can hear. I have news for you today. The season is right. &gt;&gt; I HAVE COME TO ANNOUNCE A SEASON FOR SOMEONE HERE TODAY. AMEN. JESUS SAID, &gt;&gt; "RISE UP, TAKE UP YOUR BED AND GO TO YOUR HOUSE." AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING TO YOU, WHATEVER YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. WHATEVER PROBLEM YOU HAVE HAD FOR YEARS, RISE UP. TAKE YOUR BED. GO TO YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; YOUR PROBLEM IS OVER. &gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR SEASON. &gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR SEASON. IT IS YOUR SEASON. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE LEFT THE LAME, THE BLIND, THE HALT, THE WITHERED. HE HE WENT TO THE ONE THAT WAS NOT LAME. HE WAS NOT BLIND. HE WAS NOT HOLD. HE WAS NOT WITHERED. THIS MAN FOR 38 YEARS WAS WAITING, WAITING FOR his s. THIS WOULD BE GOD'S SEASON. GOD'S WILL FOR THIS MAN IS DELIVERANCE. HALLELUJAH. Waiting is not nice. WAITING IS PAINFUL. WAITING IS BORING. WAITING FEELS LIKE CHAOS. WAITING IS FRUSTRATING. THERE IS NO ONE IN THE SCRIPTURE, A CHILD OF GOD THAT GOD MADE WAY FOR NOTHING. AMEN. I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU, MY BROTHER. HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD REASON TO MAKE YOU WAIT. GOD HAS A GOOD REASON FOR YOU TO WAIT. ABRAHAM AND SARAH THEY WAITED 25 YEARS AND then came forth. HANNAH WAITED ABOUT 19 YEARS AND THEN came forth. MANOA'S WIFE WAITED OVER 20 YEARS AND BROUGHT FORTH SAMSON. ELIZABETH WAITED MANY MANY YEARS AND BROUGHT FORTH JOHN THE BAPTIST. REBECCA WAITED 20 YEARS AND BROUGHT FORTH ISRAEL. IF YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING, YOU ARE IN GOOD COMPANY TODAY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE. YOU ARE IN BAPTIST. A PLACE OF MERCY. A PLACE OF MERCY. WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, WHEN THE SEASON IS RIGHT, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN FOR YOU. THE WAY IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH OTHERS, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH YOU. THE WAY IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR OTHERS, THE OTHERS HAD TO WAIT FOR AN ANGEL TO COME AND START THE WATERS. BUT THIS ONE, AMEN. THIS ONE, THE MASTER HIMSELF, HE CAME DOWN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER AMRA, I'VE JUST SEEN YOU. THIS IS YOUR SEASON. &gt;&gt; I HAVE HEARD YOUR TESTIMONY. WHAT IS IT? DON'T DOUBT IT A BIT. THIS YOUNG MAN WENT TO KALI FOR OPERATION. THEY ALMOST GAVE HIM BAD NEWS, BUT HIS EYES COULD NOT SEE ANYMORE. THEY WERE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. AND HE WAS LOSING HOPE AND AND THEY APPOINTED HIM TO GO FOR OPERATION. HE WENT BACK AND THEY TOLD HIM YOU KNOW WHAT it is worse. So you have to go come back again for review. So he came he was almost GOING INTO A DEPRESSION AND YOU KNOW AROUND THE YOUTH TIME OF THE YOUTH CAMP ON THE FLOOR HE WENT BACK AND THEY REVIEWED HIM AGAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM ACTUALLY THIS EYE IS SEEING MUCH BETTER THAN the one which we operated. Say you don't NEED AN OPERATION. DON'T TELL ME. DON'T TELL ME OUR GOD IS NO. OUR GOD IS A HEALER. BUT SOMETIMES HE MAKES US WAIT. BECAUSE IT'S WAITING FOR THE SEASON. AMEN. YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO REMAIN AT PROPHETIC. COME TO CHURCH. KEEP THE FAITH. LISTEN TO THE WORD. GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY. EVEN WHEN YOU SEE NOTHING, EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL NOTHING, EVEN WHEN YOU TEST NOTHING. HALLELUJAH. EVEN WHEN YOU HEAR NOTHING, I AM HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. BETHESDA IS THE PLACE OF YOUR MERCY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MAN WAITED FOR 38 YEARS. BUT THIS was not without a purpose. Amen. THE MAN STARTED LYING ON A PALLET. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HISTORY SO YOU CAN SEE OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE. THE MAN was lying ON THIS PALACE FOR almost seven years before Jesus was born. Think about it. Prophecy, however, about Jesus's birth was given LONG BEFORE THIS man was actually born. Your problem looks like it HAS STAYED FOR SO long that Jesus is nonexistent. The devil would even dare ask you where is your God? For seven years the devil asked this man where is your God? Jesus was not yet born. But remember with God his thought is as good as his action. For seven years, the man was on the path and Jesus was not even born. But God had already thought about this man solution before this man was actually born. The prophecy had been given. Isaiah 61. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach about titles and the meek. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the of our God to comfort all that mourn. THIS MAN WAS A CAPTIVE. HE WAS brokenhearted but he was meek ONLY WAITING FOR THE second season of his healing. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL DID WHEN THE SEASON COME, NO ONE COULD hinder this man's and then Jesus came. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then Jesus came. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEARS LATER and he takes this book. &gt;&gt; He goes into the thoughts of God and he reads it to who do you think he was reading it to the death? He was testifying of his ministry, who he was. And he said, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has ANOINTED ME TO PREACH GOOD TIDINGS unto the meek." Notice this was in first person pronoun. This is HOW THE PROPHECY WAS GIVEN. ISAIAH WAS GIVING THE PROPHECY, not telling us what it WAS MEANING, BUT JESUS READS IT. AND WHENEVER IT REACHES on me, HE EMPHASIZES IT. THE PHARISEES ARE LOOKING AT HIM. THE SADDUCEES ARE LOOKING AT HIM. AND HE READS, "THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GOD IS upon me." BECAUSE THE LORD HAS ANOINTED ME to preach the GOOD TO THE MEEK. HE HAS SENT ME TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEART TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON TO THOSE THAT ARE TO PROCLAIM THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. HE CLOSED THE BOOK. EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HIM. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? WHO ARE YOU? AND THEN HE BEGAN TO SAY THESE WORDS. THIS DAY, THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE FULFILLED IN YOUR EARS. MEANING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE TO COME. HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; I AM THE ONE. AMEN. I'M HERE. I HAVE ARRIVED. IT IS MY TIME. IT IS MY SEASON TO COME AND HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO TAKE THOSE WHO ARE IN PRISON AND SET THEM FREE. I AM HERE TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO LOSE those who are bound. ALL HELL had to give way for the season. Pray pray and this man was there for so long and the devil begins to tempt you. Is your God alive? You think your God exists? Is even the message true? If it was true when that man of God prayed for you, why didn't things change? Let us be realistic when you went at the altar and I prayed for you. Didn't you even fall down? Did you feel the anointing? You did. What happened? Tell me what happened. Leave those ones. They don't have the power. That's why you still have your problem. And then it begins to weigh on you. I think it is true. This brother, God sent him a prophet from Nigeria. Nigeria. He told him, "Live those ones. Just come. You are even anointed that I don't know. I'll make you my associate pastor. I'll give you money. You I will improve your life. But the brother said, "No, what are you going to do when a devil comes at you like that? TO THIS MAN REGARDLESS OF HIS CONDITION WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION. WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION, THIS IS OUR SEASON. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR SEASON. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Would thou be made whole? &gt;&gt; He asked the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Would you be made whole? Stop the excuses. The man was like, "Ah, I have no one to help me. The water is troubled. No one to put me in. I can no one I have no connection." YOU DON'T NEED CONNECTIONS. STOP THE EXCUSES. TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS. LOVE THEM. TELL THEM STOP THE EXCUSES. AMEN.

BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN THE DEVIL CANNOT STOP THE ANGEL FROM MOVING AND WHEN THE SEASON WAS RIGHT, AMEN. AND THE PROPHET HAD ARRIVED, THERE WAS NO DEVIL THAT COULD STOP THAT MIRACLE FROM HAPPENING. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS, OUR PROPHET HAS ALREADY COME. WE ARE UNDER THE MINISTRY OF ELIJAH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE ARE IN OUR SEASON OF RESTORATION. AM I PREACHING TO YOU, SISTER? WE ARE IN OUR SEASON. LET'S GET IT TODAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHOUTING. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXCITEMENT. I AM TALKING ABOUT A PERSONAL REVELATION. WHEN YOU GET IT, YOU ARE GOING TO WALK OUT OF HERE.

And so me, I did not know. You know, sometimes we see women pregnant, we don't know how long. And so I said when I first heard or learned that brother Brian's wife was expecting I said my wife, isn't that too fast? Is it two months? She said, "No, I talked to her." No, women talk. It's about SEVEN OR EIGHT. OH, IT'S almost you. And I knew this is around the time that the devil was always coming. And then do you know when I knew it is done, brother Brian is when she told me that your wife is going to have a God. &gt;&gt; You remember that I told you? &gt;&gt; Yes. And had you checked? Did you know at that time you had checked? Did you talk to us? But God had already known. And then when we TOLD HIM, "YEAH, IF YOU'RE HAVING A BABY." So I knew this one the devil will not take is the season. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you this is our season as the bride of Christ. Brother Bham saw the vision the PREVIEW and I believe I was in that. I cannot die. The devil cannot have me before my time. Now I want to try and bring you to a climax. Be prepared now. This is our time our season. Isaiah 61 three to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion. Get it? Get it? Get it? Isaiah 61:3. This is what happens in our time. Amen. If you've been mourning, your time of morning is over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Receive these declarations as a word of God for your life individually, PERSONALLY. to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beautiful ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. Now, there is something I want us TO DO, BROTHER. PUT IT ON THE SCREEN. Make it larger if you can. I want to I want to speak the bad one and you speak the good one. &gt;&gt; All right. You get it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ashes, &gt;&gt; beauty. &gt;&gt; I want you to say it with me now. &gt;&gt; Ashes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You speak in English and say that what they're saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ashes. &gt;&gt; I want EVERYBODY TO GET IT. ASHES, &gt;&gt; BEAUTY. A vu. &gt;&gt; All right, WE'LL GET IT. &gt;&gt; MORNING. &gt;&gt; MORNING. &gt;&gt; OKAY. THE SPIRIT OF HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; THE GARMENT OF THE SPIRIT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, why did we do that? Because I want you to see that there is a season that at a right time for God to do something. You realize this scripture we just read is a prophecy about our generation. IT'S NO LONGER TIME FOR MOURNING. THAT'S WHY THE PENTECOSTALS ARE STILL GOING ON THE MOUNTAIN FOR 40 DAYS FOR THE NIGHT FOR REVIVAL. REVIVAL. REVIVAL. THE BRIGHT REVIVAL IS ALREADY HERE. WE'VE PASSED THE TIME OF MORNING. AMEN. WE PASS THE TIME OF ASHES. AMEN. THIS IS A TIME FOR BEAUTY. AMEN. THIS IS THE TIME FOR JOY. AMEN. THIS IS THE TIME. AMEN. FOR THE GARMENT OF PRAISE. AMEN. NO MORE HEAVINESS. NO MORE ASHES. NO MORE MONEY. AMEN. WE MIGHT BE CALLED. WHO ARE WE RIGHT NOW? WE ARE THE TREES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOT OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT COMES BY THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHT SEASON, THE RIGHT TIME. AND THEN HE SAYS THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED. BROTHER DID NOT SAY THIS THAT DAY THAT SCRIPTURE WAS FULFILLED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE FULFILLED. AND I SAY UNTO YOU, THE SAME THING. THIS DAY. IS THERE SCRIPTURE FULFILLED? IT'S YOUR TIME OF JOY. IT'S YOUR TIME OF PRAISE. AMEN. IT'S YOUR TIME OF BEAUTY. YOUR TIME OF MORNING IS OVER. Your time of morning is over. YOUR TIME OF MORNING IS OVER. GOD, MAY YOU REVEAL IT TO SOMEONE HERE. YOUR TIME OF MORNING IS OVER. YOUR TIME OF MORNING IS OVER. YOUR TIME OF ASHES IS OVER. YOUR TIME OF THE SPIRIT OF HEAVINESS IS OVER. IF YOU HAVE A SPIRIT OF HEAVINESS IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LIKE JESUS DID, I CAST IT OUT OF YOU. THE TIME OF HEAVINESS IS OVER. LET GO AND LET GOD COME IN AND LET HIM DO HIS PERFECT WORK IN YOU. LET HIM BRING FULL adoption by the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is a time of beauty. It's a time of joy. Amen. Why? Because God has moved on the scene in this generation. And they shall build the old wests. Listen to this prophecy. THEY SHALL RAISE UP THE FORMER DESOLATIONS. Read vers four. They shall build the old west. Amen. Amen. SAY AMEN. SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL BUILD THE OLD WEST. They shall build the old west. &gt;&gt; I have a question for you. What has been a worst in your life? Feel something has been a worst like Lord I'm wored when this happens. When praise comes back, when when when when when uh you know uh uh beauty comes back, when righteousness comes, when the glory of God, then you are going to be able to build the old west. That's the message of the hour. What you think was broken, what you think was western, is a time of rebuilding. I don't know who I'M TALKING TO TODAY. BUT I AM SURE I FEEL in my spirit. God is ministering to someone here. You've cried enough. YOU'VE CRIED ENOUGH. STOP CRYING FOR WHAT YOU WASTED. STOP CRYING FOR WHAT THE MISTAKES YOU MADE. IT'S A TIME OF REBUILDING.

The desolations OF MANY GENERATIONS AND strangers shall stand and feed your flocks AND SONS OF THE ALIENS SHALL BE YOUR PLOW MEN AND YOUR VINE DRESSERS. You better say amen to these things, friends. But he shall be named the priests OF THE LORD. THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD. HELLO, PRIESTS OF THE LORD. HELLO, PRIESTS OF THE LORD. HOLY, HOLY UNTO THE LORD. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. MEN SHALL CALL YOU THE MINISTERS OF OUR GOD. Ye shall eat THE RICHES OF THE GENTILES. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT?

Listen to this one now. Ye shall EAT THE RICHES OF THE GENTILES. I don't MAKE NEED TO SUFFER MAKING RICHES. I will eat the riches of the Gentiles. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what? &gt;&gt; Someone called me, &gt;&gt; the man who is selling us the church line and told me, "Pastor, uh, someone wants your church line." Uh, and he's he wants to give you 20 more million. I said, "No, sorry, I'm not saying." I said, "Okay." I've talked to him again. He's adding 40 more millions. I said, "No, we're not selling." 40 more millions. &gt;&gt; Those are riches of the Gentiles. But we have to determine what we want to eat. They should give us one more one more 100 meals. Then we will think about it. LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, GOD IS FIXING AT THIS TIME IN THIS SEASON TO DO THINGS WHICH WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.

PREPARE FOR REJOICING. I SAID PREPARE FOR REJOICING. DON'T LOOK AT ME AS IF I'M TALKING TO SOMEONE. &gt;&gt; I AM TALKING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; PREPARE FOR REJOICING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God bless you. GO BACK YOUR SEATS. THEREFORE, &gt;&gt; IN THEIR LAND, &gt;&gt; IN THEIR LAND THEY SHALL POSSESS THE DEVIL. Oh my GOOD LORD. THEY SHALL POSSESS THE DOUBLE. EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UNTO THEM. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET DOUBLE ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET DOUBLE IN EGYPT. YOU ARE GETTING DOUBLE IN YOUR LAND. IN THE MESSAGE LAND, IN THE HOLY GHOST LAND, IN CAN LAND, YOU ARE GETTING DOUBLE IN YOUR LAND. YOU ARE GETTING DOUBLE IN THE PROMISE WHICH IS FULFILLED. Everlasting joy shall be unto them. Blessed be the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the in the way of sinners, nor sitth in the seat of the scornful, BUT HIS DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW OF THE LORD. AND IN HIS LAW DOES HE MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT, AND IT SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY THE RIVERS OF WATER, AND BRINGETH FORTH HIS FRUIT, IN HIS SEASON, HIS LEAF ALSO SHALL NOT WITHER, AND WHATSOEVER HE DOETH SHALL PROSPER. I SAID, SHALL PROSPER. Now he shall in the resurrection of the tree says now he shall bring forth HIS FRUIT. GOD IS FRUIT IN HIS SEASON. Watch each his personal pronoun there HIS IT IS HIS FRUIT. GOD IS FREE IN THE SEASON THAT THE PROPHET IS BRINGING. The angel brings the fruit in God season. GOD HAS A SEASON, A CERTAIN SEASON WHEN THE ANGEL brings the fruit. BLESSED BE THE MAN. AMEN. THAT WALKETH NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNTH is in the law of the Lord. And he SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY THE RIVERS OF WATER THAT BRINGETH FORTH HIS FRUIT. GOD IS FRUIT IN THE PROPHET SEASON. HALLELUJAH. Brother says the New Testament preacher is a prophet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So in this service, little service, I am God's angel to you now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So which means I am not only to come and preach. I am dust to come and cause things to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who has revelation will see it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You get the point, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When that angel came, that angel was not God, but it was the angel of the Lord. WHEN HE CAME DOWN, he brought the healing with you. And Jesus came to SYMBOLIZE OR SHOW SOMETHING. THE OTHER WAS A SHADOW. But Jesus was the reality. So he told me, "You don't need to wait FOR THAT ANGEL ANYMORE. I am healed." Hallelujah. And what did he do? He brought healing. Jesus never prayed for healing. He gave healing. If you read IN THE BIBLE, HE TELLS YOU GO. JESUS TOLD HIS DISCIPLES, "GO CAST DEMONS, CLEANSE LEPERS." THEY HAD THE POWER TO DO THOSE THINGS. AND THE BRIDE TODAY IS IN THAT SEASON OF FULL ADOPTION, FULL RESTORATION. THAT'S WHAT THE THIRD POOL IS. THAT'S WHAT THE WORD DOES. IT RESTORES US BACK AGAIN TO THAT SAME AUTHORITY. IT'S NO LONGER HERE, GOD. HE'S NOW HEARING HIM WHO A SON OF GOD FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GOD AND THINGS WILL MATERIALIZE. AMEN. AMEN. IT IS GOD'S FRUIT IN THE SEASON THE PROPHET IS BRINGING IN. GOD IS FRUIT IN GOD'S TIME BY THE PROPHET'S SEASON. He shall bring forth his fruit in his season. So if there isn't two he's there bring forth he is God's fruit now he'll bring now he says it cannot wither is God predestinated fruit in there can't be destroyed because it is PREDESTINATED praise God I want to finish reading the quote. The seed is not held with the just pray we get it. He says the world is in a sodom condition and the church has went into Sodom with it and Lot and his wife and I say that there IS A ELECTED CHURCH somewhere in this world that's pulled out and set aside from those THINGS and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention. The manifestation of God has attracted my attention. The manifestation OF GOD has attracted our attention. We are no longer at a time of only believing and hearing things. A time of manifestation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THE SHARK HAS GIVEN FORTH HIS STRENGTH INTO THE SEA. It went on out. It was a good shack, but it served its time. WE ARE NO LONGER AT THE TIME OF THE SHEEP. FOR THE SEED IS NOT H WITH THE SHEEP. IT IS THE WORD BRIDE OF THE WORD GROOM, THE NATURAL SEED OF ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB. NATURAL SEED RATHER OF ISHMAEL, NATURAL SEED OF Isaac and SO FORTH AND HAD TO GO INTO THE ground in order to bring out this other one. And so has all these others. THE SEED HAS TO DRY. I MEAN THE SHARK HAS TO DRY RATHER. AND THE POLLEN HAS TO DRY AND EVERYTHING DIES SO THE SEED can produce itself. That's the WAY IT IS BEEN IN EVERY AGE. Denomination has been the carriers. Part of that is the word for it has been hid from the wise reformers or sealed away from them until the age of the ego has appeared a certain season. The Bible says so. Yes sir. BECAUSE WE ARE PROMISED THAT IN Malachi 4 exactly we ARE HE'S HIDDEN FROM THE EYES OF the wise and THE PRUDENT AND as we just went through the book of revelation WE FIND OUT THAT ALL THREE of those messengers all those beasts that went forth each one suited Luther just right each one seated the other one just right and which is the ox and the different animals of the Bible it went forth to justification sanctification even into the Pentecostals to bring but the fourth was an eagle. So then he begins to talk about the four beasts. Of course we know them as the lion, the horse and the the face of man and then the flying eagle. Those are the four anointings of God in different seasons. BUT NOW BUT NOW WE ARE IN A SEASONAL OF A FLYING EGO. IT HAS TO COME THROUGH AND THROUGH THAT AGE GOD RAISED IT UP. IT HAS TO come through that age to be correct. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The ego promise being fulfilled but Malachi THOUGHT Jesus was not OF MARY but came through Mary like the life through the sha. We've gone through all those denominational ages, but now it's another season. We've arrived, we have arrived at another time, the time of the flying eagle, flying higher than all the other denominational ideas and creators. We at a time of full adoption, full restoration of the bride is the bride coming of Christ revealing the very works doing the same works he did. That's why brother Bam says that now God has actually revealed one of the mysteries that he has revealed in this day is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. without sensation but doing the very same works. Let me read it for you. I want you to see something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to see something for our Amen. It says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did. Some people think here that sensation is not there. Now what brother Bam is saying he's talking about the Pentecostal SHOCK HOW when they shouted they thought THEY when they spoke in tong THEY THOUGHT THEY WHEN THEY FELL ON the phone they thought THEY BUT THEY DON'T GO BEYOND THAT WHAT IS IT THE PERSON OF THE HOLY GHOST IS MORE THAN SENSATION SENSATION WILL COME WITH IT BUT IT IS MORE THAN SENSATION WHAT IS IT IS CHRIST HIMSELF THE PERSON OF CHRIST WHERE IN YOU PERFORMING IN YOU THE SAME WORKS THAT HE DID. WHICH WORKS DID HE DO WHEN THE SEASON WAS RIGHT? HE CAME AT BETHESDA AND HE TOLD THAT MAN TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK. AMEN. HE CAME TO THIS man with A BOY WITH SIN. TOOK AWAY HIM BY THE HAND AND SAID, "RECEIVE YOUR HEALING. RECEIVE YOUR SIGHT." And I'm here also SAYING THE SAME THING. WHAT IS IT? THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S NOT ME, YOUR BROTHER. IT IS GOD IN ME GIVING THOSE DECLARATIONS SPEAKING TO YOU THE WORD. WHO IS IT? IT IS THE SAME JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER, PERFORMING THE SAME WORKS. SO WHAT IS YOUR NEED? YOU YOU WANT A CHILD. AMEN. AMEN. RECEIVE YOUR CHILD. AS SIMPLE AS THAT. MARY SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE AND WHOM IT WILL HAPPEN." JUST LIKE THAT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS NOT WHAT THE PENTECOSTALS ARE DOING. THIS IS AN ADOPTED SON SPEAKING BY AUTHORITY. RECEIVE YOUR HEALING. AMEN. WHAT ABOUT YOU, BROTHER? AMEN. WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERING FOR SO LONG? DO YOU WANT TO BELIEVE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU right now that it is your season? It is your season. Some of you, even when you go back home, you have nothing to eat. RECEIVE YOUR FOOD. I SAID RECEIVE YOUR FOOD. RECEIVE YOUR FOOD. AMEN. RECEIVE A NEW JOB, A BRAND NEW JOB. HALLELUJAH. YOU CALL THAT EXCITEMENT. NO, &gt;&gt; IT'S not excitement. IT'S BELIEVING THE WORD. WHEN THE SEASON IS RIGHT, THIS MAN LYING DOWN THERE FOR 38 YEARS. And then Jesus comes and he says, "CAN YOU BE MADE WHOLE? CAN YOU BE MADE WHOLE? AND I ASK YOU AS I FINISH TONIGHT, CAN YOU BE MADE WHOLE? CAN YOU COME OUT OF YOUR SITUATION? CAN YOU BE HEALED? DO YOU BELIEVE IT? THIS MAN STARTED COMPLAINING. I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME. STOP LOOKING AT PEOPLE. DON'T LOOK AT PEOPLE. DON'T HAVE YOUR MIND ON PEOPLE. PEOPLE HAVE FAILED YOU. PEOPLE WILL FAIL YOU. THERE IS NO HOPE IN PEOPLE. LOOK AT HIM WHO IS HERE IN THIS SEASON CARRY YOU OUT OF YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "Stand up. CARRY YOUR BED. TAKE UP YOUR BED and walk. I feel like preaching right now." AMEN. STAND UP, BROTHER. STAND UP, SISTER. CARRY YOUR BED and walk. Maybe I've BEEN HAVING AN ADDICTION, A VERY STINKING ADDICTION. STAND UP, CARRY YOUR BED AND WALK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU HAVE SUFFERED. YOUR FAMILY HAS SUFFERED. AMEN. STAND UP, CARRY YOUR BED AND WALK. TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK. COME OUT OF THAT COMFORT ZONE OF THINKING YOU WILL DIE LIKE THIS. NO. WE HAVE A GOD WHO IS ALIVE. A GOD WHO CHANGES SITUATION. AND HE'S ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE SEASON OF THE BRINGER. THE SEASON OF THE BRINGER. THE ANGEL IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT ONLY ME. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER ANGEL. HALLELUJAH. He is here right now to accomplish his word. Maybe you have been having the spirit of heaviness DISAPPOINTED FOR SO LONG AND YOU HAVE YOU'RE TIRED OF PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T FORGIVE THEM. &gt;&gt; LET GO OF THAT &gt;&gt; AND WALK OUT OF THAT CONDITION BECAUSE THAT IS A PRISON &gt;&gt; WHICH WILL KILL YOU FOREVER. COME OUT OF IT AND RECEIVE YOUR HEALING. Or maybe you HAVE BEEN HAVING A DEMON THAT HAS BEEN ATTACKING WANT TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE. AM I PREACHING TO someone here today? You know you can walk out of it right now just like that. Just like that. Just like that. Just like that. JUST LIKE THAT. What if you believe it? Stand on your feet right now. Lift up your hands. Close your eyes. Worship the Lord. Say, "Lord, I believe." Lord, I believe. We are in the season of the bringer. He has spoken to you right now. Amen. Glory to God. Glory to God. He is here now. to perform his word. That's what brother Bham would say at such a time as this. And then he would say, he is here. The Holy Spirit. But let me tell you friends, he's not only here, he's in you. He's in me and speaking to you right now. And now I put every spirit under the control of the Holy Ghost for the glory of God. Every demon that has been attacking you young people causing you to live in life of sin. I CAST IT OUT. COME OUT. COME OUT OF THEM. YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER THEM. For they belong to Jesus. Yes, they belong to this word of the hour today. What God has done in our day, if you've been having a spirit of heaviness, receive your deliverance. Receive your healing. Take up your bed AND WALK. TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK. TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK. YES, you can. Yes, you can. NOT BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU CAN, BUT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO YOU RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; YES, you can. It's not about what you have done about it. It's about the season. When the season is right, then God moves. And that's the impossible. Your family in confusion. Disagreement with your husband. Let me tell you, that's a spirit that can't destroy you. Receive your healing. Healing. &gt;&gt; Healing. Healing. &gt;&gt; Freedom. be filled with the Holy Ghost. You know, if you believe right now, you can even be filled with the Holy Ghost.

Come up here. &gt;&gt; I may start narrating nearly the past 19 years of my life and you will have to spend a lot of time here. But I promise you Let me just give a a brief testimony. &gt;&gt; So when I was in hospital, the doctors asked me how have you been managing to to go to school and this is a telescope. &gt;&gt; This is called a telescope. would sit in front here with a chalkboard about a meter away. They could use a microscope to read from what is on the blackboard. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't know how I even was blind but it could see. &gt;&gt; I just got to realize it. The doctors were asking me why did you delay? Why did it take long to just go on? And I said okay. Now it's time for operation. You will come back next time, make a review, then we take you to the theater. So I went back the second time. When I when they told me to come back here the first time. I think I was back to Uganda for about one week and a half. Then during that time already I could see that there's a change in my sight. It's not going lower. It was becoming better. So we went back again. Then their machines wrote the results and they said it is worse. It was 0.5 now it is 0.3 they said okay go back then when you get a corner you will come back. So a few weeks before then when we came back I just told that but you know if that thing is taking long just leave it. You may see that I still have a problem maybe physically or what but my sight inside is I had a white thing on my I don't know if it's still there. So my dad told me it is still there. Let's first wait for it to clear and let's go back and be certain. And I said, "Okay, no problem." &gt;&gt; And we kept on waiting and waiting. When we went back the third time, we both of us, me and dad, we went, I would read, but not much. So they told me, "Okay, now close that. You use the sick eye." Then the service I was sitting there in the service and pastor said, "Open Isaiah. I I hadn't got the scripture with my ears. So what I did I looked to the other corner that corner where you see that word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That is where I got the scripture from. before before turning here to read what is here was a problem when I'm reading it would be a very that's why I just I was quiet but smiling I was indeed God cares I have a miracle working I have I have a miracle working.

Amen. Please be seated. Maybe before I dismiss the service, just wanted to uh to let you know I have two brothers here that I know of, a brother and a family that have uh that told me that they have uh decided to make this church their home church. One is so I'd like you to help me to welcome them. One is a brother called Francis. &gt;&gt; Can you stand up, brother Francis? Francis. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're welcome to give your brother as uh is um he was already in one of our morning devotions at the youth camp and uh he's coming from the place where I come from those areas there some part in western Uganda Uganda. &gt;&gt; So uh you're welcome my brother. God bless you. Amen. And and so uh also there is another family we have already announced on on Wednesday brother Edson and his family. Are you all here? &gt;&gt; Is your wife here? Can you please stand so we can see? God bless you. Uh they have uh they have three children, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So are they all here? Why don't you bring your family here so everybody can see you very well when they see you outside they can recognize you so was an associate minister in one of the associate ministers in brother Charles child's church in but about three years ago he moved to area and I think this was the first church where he came at the time. But of course, he's been waiting upon the Lord for leadership and direction. And so the Lord led them to come and make this their God bless you. Yeah. So that's uh what the name of your wife. Okay. So, brother has also been one of the translators of the Atoeso language message books for years now and currently he recently we started on the audio translation project and is very burdened for that. So, I believe that uh it is doing a noble work. and also he's involved with an an institution at um uh what is the name of &gt;&gt; 914 in area &gt;&gt; where he's also helping them with several things. So uh it's a blessing for us uh to have him you know join the ministry uh because uh he's also a preacher of the word. I believe he will be a blessing as we will be a blessing to him. I trust that you'll be a blessing to the body. Amen. So the ministering friends, brothers, you should be happy. We are getting more hands on board. God bless you, brother. God bless you, Edith. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Shalom.
