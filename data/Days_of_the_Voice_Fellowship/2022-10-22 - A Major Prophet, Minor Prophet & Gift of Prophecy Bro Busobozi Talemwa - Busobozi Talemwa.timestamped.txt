[0:00] standing why don't you take your Bibles
[0:03] [Music]
[0:05] foreign
[0:38] I must give
[0:41] this concerning
[0:50] signing the pattern of God that's what
[0:53] we want us to want to do for us today
[1:05] is
[1:08] for the sake of our reading tonight we
[1:11] shall just read verse 7.50 yeah
[1:20] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:22] he revealed his secret unto his servants
[1:25] the prophets
[1:36] amen Lord Jesus we permit the scripture
[1:40] that we have read in the future
[1:47] to commit ourselves
[1:56] to go into a little bible study tonight
[2:05] to each and every one of us here
[2:19] we may be seated
[2:25] so I will just I want to greet you all
[2:29] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:36] I've made it tonight
[2:39] and so I I have a lot to cover and I'll
[2:43] just go straight into the scripture
[2:47] I'm requesting people decide if you can
[2:51] check this site for at least 39.
[2:58] amen Amina
[3:04] and so tonight I'm going to speak on a
[3:06] Major Prophets
[3:17] and I give the prophets
[3:27] I don't know I don't know
[3:41] okay we will understand as we go along
[3:45] I know someone interpreter
[3:50] so there are many interpretations to eat
[3:54] but uh I like Brother Martin said we
[3:57] want to look at a major prophet or a
[3:59] prophet of the age
[4:00] why are you getting the drugs
[4:08] uh
[4:12] explain it here
[4:14] if you're wrong in Spanish
[4:23] the prophetic or prophecy
[4:26] is a wonderful thing to the church a
[4:28] wonderful gift to the church in general
[4:31] [Music]
[4:35] and brother Ken
[4:38] spoken spoke about a voice
[4:43] and he he spoke about the the voice of
[4:49] the Prophet
[4:52] we should hear the voice
[4:57] whenever God sends a prophet he expects
[5:01] us to hear his voice
[5:05] but you see that this one has been used
[5:08] and misused in our generation that we do
[5:10] not uh understand its meaning anymore
[5:14] [Music]
[5:20] until that some people are really
[5:23] allergic to it
[5:28] and they do not want to hear it
[5:31] because to them a prophet is somebody
[5:34] who deceives others and takes their
[5:37] money in the name of speaking in the
[5:39] name of the Lord
[5:42] [Music]
[5:47] especially in our generation
[5:49] I'm also here in Uganda
[5:52] Uganda we have a lot of people calling
[5:54] themselves prophet
[5:56] and others even call themselves Major
[5:58] Prophets
[6:00] and so then you do not understand but I
[6:03] want us to look at this in a scriptural
[6:06] point of view
[6:10] does God still use prophets
[6:18] that's prophecy still happened today
[6:22] what is prophecy anyway
[6:25] but I would like us to see that in the
[6:28] Book of Amos he begins by saying surely
[6:30] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[6:31] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[6:35] the prophets
[6:44] so now in every generation and I would
[6:47] like you to follow me closely
[6:49] because you will be doing some quotes
[6:51] and scriptures
[6:54] on Wednesday we usually have a Bible
[6:57] study whatever you want to call it but I
[6:59] hope that we all have our spiritual
[7:02] antennas tuned tonight
[7:09] amen are you all right brother amen
[7:12] foreign
[7:17] [Music]
[7:24] [Music]
[7:41] [Music]
[8:04] they reached that time and they wanted
[8:07] that King like the people of the land
[8:10] the promised land one word
[8:16] and they said we want a king to rule us
[8:19] just like in other kingdoms
[8:24] initially the plan and the pattern of
[8:27] God was to lead his people by a prophets
[8:35] says
[8:38] or a prophet whatever you want to call
[8:41] it a prophet is a compound word one
[8:43] argument is
[8:47] just like sanctification is a compound
[8:50] word
[8:52] it means green and set aside
[8:58] and so there's many words and especially
[9:00] in English the words that are compounds
[9:44] [Music]
[9:59] so you see that is under inspiration
[10:04] but also a prophecy could mean or a
[10:09] prophet is somebody that foresee
[10:10] something
[10:15] and also in another message here the
[10:17] identification of Christ in all ages
[10:22] he says in the beginning he spoke to the
[10:24] prophets and the word of the Lord came
[10:26] to the prophets
[10:31] and the prophet being able to foretell
[10:34] Divine things and it happened just like
[10:36] that was his identification
[10:48] means one who fought tells or tails
[10:52] forth is
[10:57] a Divine interpreter of the written word
[11:05] anybody knows anybody that knows that
[11:08] knows what a prophet means
[11:13] now the English word Prophet is
[11:18] a preacher chicken
[11:21] just anybody preaching
[11:24] is a prophet
[11:27] of the Old Testament
[11:30] which was referred to as a prophet
[11:34] he was the one that forced things
[11:39] he said if there be one among you who is
[11:43] spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will
[11:45] make myself known unto him
[11:51] and what he says shall come to pass and
[11:57] what it says if it comes to pass then
[11:59] hear him
[12:02] actually in the Old Testament if
[12:05] somebody came up and said I am a prophet
[12:07] and and I'm speaking in the name of the
[12:09] Lord and he said something and it never
[12:11] came to pass they stunned him to death
[12:18] because the prophet had to be Asia
[12:25] the word of the Lord came to him
[12:29] a lot of what he said was touted or
[12:32] supposed to be doubted
[12:36] everything he said was that say it alone
[13:14] is born in the world
[13:16] he is ordained for ordained of God to do
[13:19] that
[13:24] because gifts and callings are without
[13:27] repentance
[13:33] how we are going to look and address
[13:35] this tonight
[13:38] we are going to cut it into three phases
[13:44] I'd like us to first of all look at our
[13:47] prophet
[13:48] then we look at a minor prophet and then
[13:50] we look at the gift of Prophecy time
[13:52] will Allah
[13:59] then we see the differences and what
[14:02] works when and what we have in our
[14:04] generation and what we must have in our
[14:05] time
[14:11] how can I expect them tonight
[14:14] hey man this is a good subject for us as
[14:17] Believers of the message
[14:22] now in the message
[14:27] says there never was in the age any two
[14:31] Major Prophets on the earth at one time
[14:45] [Music]
[14:49] and Elijah was the prophet until Elijah
[14:52] came
[14:54] back then when Elijah was taking off a
[14:58] portion another portion of Elijah's
[14:59] Spirit the light rather Elijah's Spirit
[15:01] Came Upon her life
[15:07] now we want to see the first thing is
[15:10] when looking at a major prophetic
[15:16] there is usually in every generation one
[15:19] major prophet
[15:24] God has to send one
[15:28] according to almost three what did he
[15:30] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[15:34] foreign
[16:38] foreign
[16:39] [Music]
[16:44] [Applause]
[16:55] [Music]
[17:38] that Jesus there is no profit
[17:45] but the Bible I read tells me
[17:48] that our God is the same and he never
[17:51] changes
[17:53] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[17:55] and forever
[17:58] the god of the Jehovah of the Old
[18:01] Testament again is the Jesus of the new
[18:04] yes
[18:16] because whatever he thinks is perfect
[18:19] the first time
[18:21] [Music]
[18:31] that's why the Bible the Bible does not
[18:34] have another Edition
[18:38] the Bible is there is the one true word
[18:41] of God
[18:44] people can write many versions of it
[18:48] according to their understanding
[18:52] of this Bible is one it's the word of
[18:56] God that does not change
[19:03] it requires today
[19:06] so we see that God uses Major Prophets
[19:12] there is a Moses
[19:20] Jeremiah
[19:23] Elijah you can go on and on
[19:26] are you and these were all prophets in
[19:29] our generation
[19:30] but God did not use a Daniel and an
[19:35] Isaiah in the same generation
[19:39] he did not use a Samuel and a Moses at
[19:43] the same time
[19:45] in one generation
[20:43] you know what the other people are
[20:45] saying
[20:48] it's not from your opinion
[20:52] if there are people
[21:05] [Music]
[21:51] with one one purpose
[21:54] anybody
[22:06] tried to run away from that calling
[22:09] me
[22:11] God tell it with them
[22:15] and even after that they had to go until
[22:21] because they were born prophets
[22:28] Anointed with the spirit
[22:31] they were born to prophesy
[22:35] speak the word of God
[23:35] it is
[23:39] foreign
[23:44] [Applause]
[24:05] he couldn't help being a Moses
[24:13] God sent him down and gave him life on
[24:17] Earth
[24:19] and all the Pharaohs in the world
[24:22] couldn't have killed himself
[24:37] when their work is
[24:43] no matter how they died
[24:52] he gave his message his voice was the
[24:56] voice of God
[25:03] they killed him foreign
[26:48] are you here
[27:01] you must know your Bible to you
[27:06] hallelujah amen Jeremiah chapter one you
[27:10] know Jeremiah was one of the Major
[27:11] Prophets
[27:13] of the Lord came unto me saying before I
[27:16] formed thee in the belly I knew this is
[27:37] amen the prophets did not need the
[27:40] ordination of the council
[27:44] the process did not need you know the
[27:46] crowning of the society or the
[27:48] denominations
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] foreign
[28:35] unto thee I Prophet from the midst of
[28:39] thee of thy Brethren like unto me
[28:42] unto him you shall
[28:45] hey
[29:00] praise the name of the Lord
[29:03] and Moses are the prophet he was
[29:06] prophesying
[29:08] and he was saying there will one day
[29:11] be another Prophet like unto me
[29:17] one of you
[29:20] hmm
[29:22] remember that God told Moses
[29:25] I will not be only a prophet with them
[29:27] but you will be gone
[29:31] and so he was a prophet
[29:33] god cartoon
[29:36] and now here he was giving a prophecies
[29:50] foreign
[30:28] and when he came in John 14 11 he said
[30:30] believe that I am in the father
[30:39] anyone else believe me for the very
[30:41] Works
[30:44] did you see how Vindicated how prophets
[30:48] have Vindicated
[31:04] Hallelujah Amina
[31:06] and he tried to show them he was the god
[31:10] yeah
[31:11] he told them he was the son of mine
[31:15] he was mine too so what was he trying to
[31:18] say yeah he was going to be clear
[31:21] I'm the prophet God that mother spoke
[31:24] about
[31:28] but did they understand did they believe
[31:31] it but they did not understand it again
[31:34] they did not understand him
[31:43] but his own received him
[31:47] but to as many as received here
[31:53] to become the son of Christ
[31:58] [Applause]
[32:00] at least if you can't believe what I'm
[32:03] saying
[32:04] let me show you the proof
[32:07] I am here
[32:13] foreign
[32:43] I mean Hallelujah
[32:47] Matthew 11 2. my name is
[32:51] now when John had her
[32:55] when John had heard
[32:59] if I wanted to get it in the Bible have
[33:02] a very big Bible in in in in your in
[33:06] your place it says Matthew 11 3 says now
[33:08] when John had heard in the prison The
[33:11] Works of Christ he sent two of his
[33:13] disciples and said unto him after thou
[33:16] he that should come oh do we look for
[33:19] another
[33:20] Jesus answered and said unto them go and
[33:23] show John again those things which ye do
[33:26] here and see
[33:32] them yes
[33:41] [Music]
[33:51] find receive their site
[33:53] [Music]
[34:04] the poor have the gospel reached to them
[34:10] and blessed is he
[34:12] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[34:20] what did the scripture say that when the
[34:22] Messiah comes will do
[34:25] [Music]
[35:02] when John was in the prison
[35:07] he sent the people to go and ask whether
[35:10] Jesus was that Prophet which he expected
[35:13] to come yes
[35:18] to really think about this for a moment
[35:24] a man who declared that this is Jesus
[35:35] and he's telling his followers
[35:38] go and find out whether he's the one
[35:42] but just go and ask him directly
[35:45] [Music]
[35:46] it seems the story has not become like a
[35:49] Pharisee
[35:54] foreign
[36:16] [Music]
[36:26] go and find out boys
[36:36] that I announced to the people
[36:39] so that if it's not the right one then I
[36:42] can apologize I give a public apology
[36:51] foreign
[37:04] [Music]
[37:44] do you know the Vindication of Batman
[37:48] [Music]
[37:49] yeah
[37:51] does it speak of him
[38:01] and so here comes Jesus yes he didn't
[38:06] begin pumping his chest
[38:08] I am the one let me do some some kind of
[38:12] uh uh uh mathematic for you
[38:16] so you can see that I am the one that is
[38:23] and he didn't even do the things he he
[38:26] could have done
[38:30] but you see the things that was written
[38:33] about him
[38:35] you have to understand that we as
[38:37] children of God are not supposed to do
[38:39] things that are are not written of us
[38:45] we are shooting of God are here to
[38:47] fulfill that which was written about us
[39:01] foreign
[39:56] we must manifest Christ to renew God
[39:59] exactly we must bring forth his nature
[40:01] his life
[40:04] praise the name of the Lord
[40:06] and Jesus was standing there yesterday
[40:09] and he he called a sick night time but I
[40:13] prayed for them he went to the lamb
[40:16] prayed for themselves
[40:34] foreign
[40:50] called himself Elijah Williams
[40:56] show me any Scripture where William
[40:57] Branham or any quote because all the
[41:00] messages of William Panama recorded the
[41:02] game again
[41:05] foreign
[41:16] [Music]
[41:33] [Music]
[42:01] the only way to vindicate a major
[42:03] prophet is whether or not he fulfills
[42:05] what is written of him
[42:13] let me ask you a question
[42:15] how many of you were in the
[42:17] denominations
[43:26] foreign foreign
[44:03] does it mean that because there is a
[44:06] major prophet in our generation God does
[44:08] not use others as prophets
[44:18] in the message is what it says to watch
[44:21] when they go to Kadesh paneer
[44:24] cartoon
[44:28] Moses sent out one of the of his tribes
[44:39] see which way they was to enter
[44:43] and he sent his General Joshua
[44:47] which was a prophet
[44:52] now
[45:13] what's that Moses
[45:19] foreign
[45:40] March the engineer during the time of
[45:43] prophet Moses
[45:45] even if it is
[45:47] not recorded
[45:49] what is important is the message of the
[45:53] major prophet
[45:56] the message of the Minor Prophets
[45:59] to individuals such a normal individual
[46:03] churches are getting all individual
[46:06] areas
[46:07] certain things
[46:10] but the message of the major prophet
[46:14] is a message to the whole world
[46:20] the whole world the whole world has to
[46:24] hear that message
[46:25] the whole world has to believe that
[46:27] message and if they don't believe it
[46:30] there is repercussions
[46:52] maybe God can use me or God can use
[46:55] somebody else to give a message to
[46:57] Uganda
[47:00] Uganda such and such will happen
[47:03] they don't even need to be Believers of
[47:05] the message
[47:09] gifts and callings of God without
[47:10] repentance
[47:13] and so don't think that this idea of
[47:16] prophets is is supposed to be those in
[47:18] your circles or those that believe what
[47:20] you believe
[47:25] that's why many people did not believe
[47:27] William blatnam
[47:30] because he did not come from their
[47:32] groups
[47:34] you know he didn't come from their group
[47:37] and yet he went in every one of their
[47:40] groups
[47:42] until one time they were so confused
[47:47] the Oneness we are saying the Oneness we
[47:51] are saying
[47:53] are you one of us really
[47:56] if you're one of us what are you doing
[47:58] yeah
[48:06] we have accepted you as a prophet of God
[48:08] choice
[48:38] that both of you are wrong
[48:41] and I am right
[48:46] beside you to Italian
[48:50] you you want to make God like as if he's
[48:53] a bunch of great cartoon
[48:57] you you want to say that he said there
[48:59] is a separate God who is the father
[49:01] because
[49:11] you want to baptize calling the name of
[49:14] each of those three gods
[49:18] and you are mistaken to think that
[49:21] father son Holy Ghost are his names
[49:31] to you my Oneness Brothers
[49:35] you understand that God is
[49:39] [Music]
[49:41] that but you are wrong when it comes to
[49:44] baptism
[49:46] because you simply baptized in the name
[49:48] of Jesus
[49:50] he said Jesus is the man
[49:53] but we know that Jesus was more than a
[49:56] man
[49:58] he has a title
[50:00] God himself so he was the Lord
[50:05] Jesus
[50:06] Christ
[50:08] and so he says I I don't believe your
[50:11] baptism
[50:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:17] and that is the interpretation of father
[50:20] son holy God
[50:23] and all the Oneness we are scratching
[50:25] their heads
[50:30] and he's still associated with all of
[50:33] them
[50:35] because he was a prophet he was sent to
[50:39] all of them
[50:41] a prophet comes from no denominations
[50:47] [Music]
[51:44] that's why I let them come foreign
[52:02] [Applause]
[52:46] foreign
[53:33] from around him tied his hand
[53:37] and said thus saith the Lord yep
[53:55] the man that he
[53:56] the man and here he was his Professor
[54:00] the man that this has bound will be
[54:04] bound in Chains when he gets to
[54:07] Jerusalem
[54:08] um
[54:13] seeing the visions of the people then to
[54:16] read of Paul storms he told them said
[54:19] don't lose from this place and go
[54:21] because it will be to your harm now we
[54:24] all know that when Paul reached in
[54:26] Jerusalem he was born in Chains
[54:30] and here is a
[54:33] foreign
[55:15] foreign
[55:46] uh Prophets
[55:48] who are anointed to give the prophets of
[55:56] in Acts chapter 21 it says and as we
[55:58] tore it there many days there came down
[56:00] from Judea a certain Prophet named and
[56:04] when he was come unto us he took Paul's
[56:06] garden and bound his own hands and feed
[56:08] and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so
[56:11] shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man
[56:13] that owned this garden and shall deliver
[56:15] him into the hands of the Gentiles
[56:17] foreign
[56:37] [Music]
[57:01] praise the name of the Lord so that was
[57:04] a photographers
[57:05] and in a message
[57:08] um
[57:12] religious dream a museum
[57:19] he says now you said well the prophets
[57:22] are the of the Old Testament okay
[57:29] the New Testament had the prophets
[57:33] was a new testament Prophet
[57:37] look at the Spirit of Prophecy falling
[57:39] down there and telling Paul about it
[57:47] from Jerusalem and found Paul and tie
[57:50] this gather around him and turn over and
[57:53] say thus says the Lord the man that all
[57:55] this will be bowing chains when he gets
[57:58] to Jerusalem
[58:44] not be
[58:46] just like we have
[58:49] pastors
[58:51] to me
[58:53] we also have the office of course
[58:59] men and women
[59:01] who are supposed to be perfect

[1:02:36] foreign
[1:03:07] he is
[1:03:12] Hallelujah I mean and you are not
[1:03:15] supposed to follow his message like life
[1:03:17] and death uh
[1:03:22] why because you already have a message
[1:03:33] and that is
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:04:03] America some other place or even or even
[1:04:07] in moment
[1:04:10] it will not be affected by my message
[1:04:22] foreign
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:52] hey man I mean
[1:04:54] so if a pastor comes and says I'm the
[1:04:56] prophet here begins to preach things
[1:04:58] that are not in the message
[1:05:23] but can prophesy
[1:05:26] you see now this is a gift to professors
[1:05:30] it's among the nine spiritual gifts
[1:05:34] and this is what you find in many of the
[1:05:37] Pentecostals
[1:05:40] and they mistake it for Prophets
[1:05:48] so let me let us go through this then we
[1:05:51] shall conclude after that
[1:05:53] Solomon is here um now there is a lot of
[1:05:57] difference between a gift to prophecy
[1:05:59] and the prophet
[1:06:00] is
[1:06:04] the prophecy may be on one night on one
[1:06:08] tonight
[1:06:19] it's them nine spiritual gifts that
[1:06:22] works in the body area
[1:06:25] but a prophet is Born the prophet
[1:06:30] all done through their life
[1:06:43] someone just walk over to you
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:48] foreign
[1:08:25] my speed
[1:08:27] must be judged
[1:08:32] and then he says but you've never seen
[1:08:33] anybody
[1:08:35] to judge them
[1:08:42] no but the Bible said if one prophesies
[1:08:45] let two or three judge whether it is
[1:08:47] right or not
[1:08:56] because Saturn can sleep
[1:09:00] yes now
[1:09:12] we have the word of wisdom
[1:09:15] word of knowledge
[1:09:17] this designing our Spirits
[1:09:20] prophecy diverse kinds of tongues and
[1:09:23] the production of tongues Faith healing

[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:28] coffee
[1:11:42] that's wisdom
[1:11:45] now that's a revelation
[1:11:48] there's a word of knowledge
[1:11:53] understood what brother had and they
[1:11:56] thought he had word of knowledge
[1:12:03] what he had was more than a word of
[1:12:05] knowledge
[1:12:06] foreign
[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:57] just think and then you give a profit
[1:13:00] if you have ever given a prophecy
[1:13:02] of the Prophet you will notice
[1:13:07] oh that is also speaking in tongues
[1:13:12] and giving a prophecy this is
[1:13:20] you understand
[1:13:24] the word of knowledge or
[1:13:26] wisdomania everybody is
[1:13:31] but one of them has a gift
[1:13:35] you understand I believe when when
[1:13:39] Solomon passed the Judgment many people
[1:13:41] must have laughed
[1:13:44] but the gift of Prophecy speaking in
[1:13:48] tongues
[1:13:50] this is inspirational
[1:13:53] it comes with inspiration
[1:13:57] you know when a preacher stands here
[1:13:59] he's asked me a gift to Professor
[1:14:02] it must be inspired
[1:14:06] it's not dry yeah
[1:14:12] it's not from him
[1:14:15] according to your prayers
[1:14:19] foreign
[1:15:05] I'll give you examples here
[1:15:07] first was one of them
[1:15:10] Hallelujah I wanted to hear the prophet
[1:15:12] of escape
[1:15:14] and one of them in John 11 49
[1:15:19] and one of them named Caiaphas being the
[1:15:22] high priest that same year I say unto
[1:15:24] them ye know nothing at all no consider
[1:15:27] that it is expedient for us that one man
[1:15:30] should die for the people and that the
[1:15:32] world nation perished
[1:15:48] foreign
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:17:11] foreign
[1:18:17] foreign
[1:18:44] so the prophets can be given by the good
[1:18:46] and the bad
[1:18:49] that's why it has to be jacket
[1:18:52] where that is right or wrong
[1:18:57] oh I love the Lord don't you love the
[1:18:59] Lord
[1:19:00] I'll give you another example here
[1:19:06] he wanted to kill David and hear this in
[1:19:10] first Samuel chapter 19 verse 18.
[1:19:13] so David flat and escape
[1:19:19] and told him that all Soul had done to
[1:19:22] him and he and so Samuel went and dwelt
[1:19:25] in Niles
[1:19:27] and it was told Saul saying behold David
[1:19:30] is at Nile in Rama and so send
[1:19:33] Messengers to David and when they saw
[1:19:36] the company of the prophets prophesying
[1:19:39] and uh excuse me and Samuel was standing
[1:19:42] as appointed over them the spirit of the
[1:19:45] Lord was upon the messengers of soul and
[1:19:48] they also prophesied
[1:20:00] foreign
[1:20:31] and I believe they even maybe had swords
[1:20:37] they were sent to go catch him alive
[1:20:50] or dead
[1:20:55] the boys
[1:21:05] I mean David was hidden
[1:21:09] question is
[1:21:12] you know Samuel was a prophet and I
[1:21:15] believe there were many other Minor
[1:21:16] Prophets
[1:21:22] we are all in one company
[1:21:31] foreign
[1:22:12] thank you
[1:22:14] what were they prophets no the spirit of
[1:22:18] Prophecy had just come upon him
[1:22:21] let us continue this is amazing and when
[1:22:25] Saul was told about peace
[1:22:28] he sent other Messengers
[1:22:31] and they prophesied also likewise
[1:22:35] everybody
[1:22:52] and the Soul said the messages
[1:23:02] your majesty oh which team send me I'll
[1:23:06] bring that boy here
[1:23:07] okay go ahead again this is the third
[1:23:10] time the third time is usually the
[1:23:12] perfect time
[1:23:13] proof and they prophesied also now
[1:23:19] even knows
[1:23:29] a big group of younger people and all
[1:23:32] people prophesying each other
[1:23:42] oh my God I mean whoever is today I must
[1:23:45] have said this is
[1:23:55] himself said let me go myself
[1:24:01] let me go myself a shortage
[1:24:04] and he came to a great way that is
[1:24:07] insectful
[1:24:09] and they asked and said where are
[1:24:12] somewhere and David
[1:24:16] where are these boys
[1:24:28] and the spirit of the Lord was upon him

[1:28:04] where there are some people who were
[1:28:06] going to judge this purpose of course
[1:28:08] why do I want this
[1:28:11] somewhere
[1:28:14] so they could tell the others
[1:28:21] Hallelujah and the man was the enemy of
[1:28:25] David
[1:28:27] but there he was the whole night sorry
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:51] and everybody was shocked
[1:28:54] his soul also has it become one of them
[1:29:01] that's how the Pentecostals are confused
[1:29:04] when they prophesy like that they think
[1:29:06] they're also prophets
[1:29:09] and they said they don't need William
[1:29:11] Brothers
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:42] because this man prophesied like this
[1:29:46] he did not repress somewhere
[1:29:51] Samuel was still there somewhere else
[1:30:03] in Acts chapter 21 verse
[1:30:06] and when we had finished our course from
[1:30:09] Tire we came to uh

[1:32:48] scripture in First Corinthians 14 293
