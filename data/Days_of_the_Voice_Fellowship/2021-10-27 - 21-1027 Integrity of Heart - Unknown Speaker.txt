[Music] oh since jesus jesus has foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] who [Music] oh [Music] [Music] everybody [Music] now i am [Music] is [Music] [Music] give him a crop of praise [Music] my bible and we will read from verses we can begin from the first verse to verses 7. to turn the killing b all right first kings 9. and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the king's house and old solomon's desire which he he was pleased to do that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me and i have allowed this house which thou has built to put my name there forever and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and with that and will keep my statutes and my judgments then i will establish the key the throne of thy kingdom upon israel forever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel now we will not ambulance all right let us read verse six and seven but if you shall at all turn from following me you or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have allowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all people i just want to greet each and every one of you in the precious name of jesus and uh we want to thank him for yet an opportunity has given us this evening i'm going to share on something very very important [Music] although you disappeared without informing us and the church where you are gone yeah what they were talking about but uh i was informed by your father names so tonight i'm going to share on the in on integrity of hearts everybody say it integrity of heart integrity of a heart away symbol and i take that from versus three four actually brother give me that verse again first kings nine three he says and the lord said unto him i have had a prayer and this application that thou hast made before me and i have allowed this house which thou has built to put my name there are there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually uh look saturn i have heard your prayer i'm pretty dope and i've had your supplication no question you need a quote that you have made before me you're my sugar and therefore i have allowed this house which thou has built johnson to put my name there there is one foreign built in the lord our house and another thing the lord received in that house one thing to do the lord something and it is another it's another but the reason is they don't go to the lord in prayer they don't seek the face of god or the mind of god about what they want to do for him but again their heart is not following the leadership of the lord but their heart is following their own desires and it has on their own objectives and and things that they have and they want to achieve [Music] and so david had wanted to build a house for the lord but before he did he inquired of the lord to see the mind of god and the lord told him no david as much as you were man after my heart i do not allow it you know has built a house for the lord and then the lord came down my command and accepted it a new manager and he said i've heard even your prayer now my name is and if thou now you solomon will walk before me you will walk before me as david your father walked several months ago i did speak on uh you know the relationship having a relationship with god so that when god comes down he is able to introduce himself as the god of so-and-so [Music] because god had a relationship with abraham commander and he introduced himself to isaac if isaac would accept also to have a personal relationship with god then now he [Music] then he becomes the god of you so we noticed here that god was already god of david and he had a relationship with david because david walked with god [Music] [Music] then i will establish your throne amen of thy kingdom upon israel forever your father david saying they shall not fail their man upon the throne of israel you are bound to receive the blessings that david received when he walked always amen i mean god honest integrity of heart symbol he was ready to bless solomon beyond measure integrity is the quality of being honest and fair away honest [Applause] [Applause] you cannot be honest when you have lasciviousness you are going to have wholeness when you have truth in your mouth when you are faithful when [Applause] so we realized that integrity category is the quality of being honest and fair always integrity this is something that originates from the from the from the type from the nature of the heart that you have and many people we are born without [Music] and by the time of the end of the service probably the lord willing we shall have you know covered a few things about this it is [Music] because david was a man after god is owned the bible says [Music] is your heart they sent you liver oh i have the joy in my heart so we also noticed that david was a man after god his own heart you know what he meant his heart is like the heart of god oh my god this was the new heart guardian the bible says in the book of ezekiel that we even god will give you what first the first thing he gives you is a new heart then he gives you a new spirit [Applause] where god is guidelines what was it he gives god his guidelines here uprightness uprightness [Applause] very number is simple you find them packaging a product and they tell you we have abcd but it is not so in a business very many people they don't have the integrity katimo business starting to find the civilian symbol in day-to-day lives sometimes they don't have integrity people around about us our communities our societies no integrity jesus he was faithful would not do anything as long as it was not in the world he asked the people come show me what i've done wrong mooned against [Music] who can tell me that i have not faithfully abided with every jesus did not do anything or say anything as long as it was not written about yes he was having integrity integrity of david's heart always he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheep folds from following the use [Music] so that he can feed the jack of his people ah say a couple of hunters so that he can feed jack of his inheritance lady of zika the inheritance of god wakatonda possession there would be a lot of something his brothers never had something his family never had enough you remember when the man of god went to david's jesus [Music] he was looking for integrity of hearts david that would be he was already trained by the sheep [Music] because remember sheep has a nature and [Music] well people known even naturally speaking that leaders must be fair and they must be honest as a matter of fact but the banham says that if you do not believe in the man of god amazing some people only direct that to the people tell you yeah you must believe in your passion you must subject yourself to your perspective you must obey you must admit go on the way where are you but that also comes to actually in church orders what's the pastor organ he's the kind of man when people uh two people have disagreements that didn't and so the bible tells me here i believe and israel all right he says so god brought him to feed them israel the people of god you cannot go higher than your pasta broth what does that mean also that's many times distracting one side if you look at it the other way the bible tells us so david fed them according to the integrity of his heart [Music] do you understand even the pastors themselves they kind of do those wildlife styles as if electricity has gone through their hair you know like in a very funny way [Applause] what does it mean i cannot go any higher than that but i want to thank god the greatest shepherd just still shaped our souls even as much as god sends us men yet they got turned out to to me the other side to shape at us they rule over us by two things yeah my young people the [Music] and the nature so that's why the bible says that he amen he fed the people according to the integrity of his heart [Music] hallelujah [Music] over his people because thou has not kept that which the lord commanded thee hallelujah and here was god ushering david into the ministry [Music] and how did he introduce him oh how i love it jesus yes he's the one who introduces a mind to the ministry i don't believe it is a man who calls another one into the ministry the secret is the anti-monetary name of awareness for the church obey can you say the denomination system all the bible your heart oh returned this integrity of heart was god's testimony oh god may you give a testimony about me will give his testimony against you amen but the lord that name will come up with jerusalem hallelujah my savior [Music] oh no my judaism and then now time will come for the judgment to be passed and guess what who will be the judge is hallelujah amen some people they say but if your actually knows the judge like that there is no condemnation anybody comes to them that are in christ after the flesh after the spirit is in fact actually i want you to see this their lack of integrity is in is in fact first an issue of the heart if my heart is right when you call me if my heart is right when he calls me if my heart is right when he calls me i'll be somewhere listening for my name if your heart is not right when he calls you back nothing will happen don't worry about to come but if your heart is right when he calls you eater you will hear your name praise the name of the lord now i want to read um another example here in genesis 20. is [Music] to project that for me now from verse one brother you can just interpret directly now abraham journeyed from there toward the towards the negev the south country even settled between kurdish and shu then [Music] she was his wife kill me so he will check my wife let me tell you tell him only half truth she's my sister oh yo man some people they don't want to lie but they want to tell half truth [Applause] your half truth is if you you know what you're supposed to say tell it all be honest [Music] and you will find out did you know there is a certain level of grace that god has given to his servants be careful before you say you are telling a white lie like abraham my abraham said again of sarah she is my sister until um god came to our marriage in a dream during the night and said behold you are a dead man because we are god's children but if we have done things wrong never to sober god was still fighting for us that is why he says not my anointed [Applause] if you don't believe me that's up to you hey what does your kid is a cheerleader but i'm preaching to you because i have a physical ground if you have a covenant with god i son of god amen or whatever you are you're not you're better god is there with you when you were stealing sin bro the movie he was with you now and the fact that he was with you again he brought god was with abraham abraham because we know that he goes on to confirm the covenant over and over god was always with him hallelujah amen our the weapons of our failure are not cannabis they bring down strongholds watch them beat everyone in a dream had not yet come near her so he said lord will you kill a people who are righteous and innocent and blameless [Music] she told me that he told me that she is my sister and she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and the bible said that david had the integrity of his heart at the bible you know where symbol is the skillfulness of his hand [Music] before you can't you take it let me present this before you can't you take it something let me present something before you let me continue and what it represents number one the integrity do you do it out of the integrity of your heart do you do it out of the innocence of your hand sometimes you find believers i said believers let me do it okay let him feel it foreign [Music] when when he heard what the man had to show yeah then god said to him in the dream god speaks through even the name he said it was i who kept you back and spared you from sinning against i did not give you an opportunity to touch are some women who claim to be believers [Applause] [Music] powerless and the king karaka could not even touch him the king would not even touch him so not only of our marriage's heart but also of sarah cartoon [Music] god is willing to protect the animals amen but let him not be able to give [Music] and uh she gave me a testimonial how she was yeah i'm going to buddha stand right here many now imagine that he is here he wants to touch you he thought it was he is a self-restraint yellow [Music] okay okay okay let me try again god you come on come on listen what do you know god eternal so mindful hello i fired you about this loved one experience [Music] what about us is right i think i'm going away i've had testimonies of people overland young people who have given me testimonies when they were almost about to backslide god saw the integrity of church we as a people today thank god and today i wanted to realize god is able to keep you from sin of course if those things happen in your past [Music] i'm preaching to you now don't let the devil bring them back to you those things are under the blood every once in a while [Music] they mean then god said to him it is i yes so now return the man his wife i didn't know zayama kaaba and before he is a prophet quite amazing how god works why was this man saved from sinning and from death for the integrity of his heart he did not intend to do it he again they did a chicken he found himself here god knows whether what you do is from the integrity of your heart [Music] if you have integrity of hearts god will ensure you do not sin katrina [Music] that is his prerogative a there but then i get up here and here is a big mountain and i say you know if i get over that mountain and save all those hundred people [Music] but when my motive and objective is right and god in my heart is leading me and i can't get over the mountains no more than i say it with that kind of a right spirit led of the holy spirit in the will of god there might not be but one little spoonful of that mountain dropped down but it's on the road how many um when you set out to go what was yours [Music] may be at you but he says if your motive is right i can be a chicken neighbor and you pray and you turn that mountain mountain no southern oregon move vow remember you have tried to go around is drop down why is the power the next day a quarter of a tournament five times you may not even see it yet but she is moving see but it is on its way going if you are standing right now and then he says i will stay right there again and watch the thing be done we are trying to collect money to buy a piece of land so we can fill a ship there today it looks impossible [Music] may not happen is [Music] [Music] give me a few moments here as i wind up with that a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bring it forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bring it forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh in of your heart you are full what you do i'm sorry i i did not mean to say that you meant to say he says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bring his first thought which is good again [Music] of their heart is mouth speaking what do you converse around when you are alone what things do you speak like good brother like for the job i'm not saying you do it who is even putting on a suit like hold on a

faster now then psalms 119 oh let me not wonder from thy commandments thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not see against you [Music] david was able to maintain the integrity of his heart that would i understand that whatsoever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the drought but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile the man that which comes out from the mouth really comes out from the heart so am i going to collect same one where is our churches our ministers where are they that will take the people in just on
