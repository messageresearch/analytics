[3:12] all your attention you can give it to me
[3:15] i want to know
[3:31] right so we're reading from verse 19.
[3:42] then then the same day at evening being
[3:45] the first day of the week when the doors
[3:47] were shot where the disciples where the
[3:49] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[3:51] jews came jesus and and stood in the
[3:54] midst and said unto them peace peace
[3:57] unto you
[4:09] foreign
[4:21] he showed unto them his hands and his
[4:23] side then were the disciples glad when
[4:26] they saw the
[4:38] to them again peace be unto you as my
[4:41] father has sent me even so send iu
[4:44] oh yes
[4:54] and when he had said this he breathed on
[4:56] them and he said unto them receive ye
[4:59] the holy ghost
[5:07] praise the name of the lord you may have
[5:09] your seat tonight
[5:12] so this we are taking part two of
[5:14] receive the holy ghost
[5:21] uh as usual for
[5:37] before you buy
[5:38] or save the service
[5:41] i mean god bless you no come about
[5:44] encouraging you to always pray for the
[5:46] service before you come back
[5:50] even as if you don't have time even as
[5:52] you are walking on the road you can be
[5:53] praying
[5:58] so we find that here jesus
[6:03] he begins to speak to the disciples
[6:08] this was shortly after the resurrection
[6:12] and you know that jesus had died and
[6:15] everybody the pharisees thought that it
[6:17] is done just finished enough
[6:43] he noticed that nothing of what he had
[6:45] created was in his image the eleventh if
[6:49] you're never turned at the world which
[6:51] are in which fought on each other it all
[6:53] came out of god beyond never living
[6:56] it came out of the spoken word
[7:00] nothing of those things that he had
[7:01] created
[7:04] was an express image of the living god
[7:11] so he needed an image
[7:14] in which
[7:25] [Applause]
[7:53] amen so we notice
[7:56] that
[8:07] [Music]
[8:08] quickly go to the book of genesis
[8:11] you can see in the okay name challenge
[8:13] already everyday
[8:15] and the bible says
[8:17] i believe
[8:21] verses 26 verse chapter one
[8:24] is truly so
[8:30] all right maybe to get a clear picture
[8:32] we can begin from verse 24.
[8:35] [Music]
[8:37] and god said let the earth be bring
[8:39] forth the living creature after his kind
[8:41] cattle and creeping thing and beast of
[8:43] the earth after his kind and it was so
[8:46] so
[8:57] and god made the beast of the earth
[8:59] after his kind and cattle after their
[9:02] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[9:04] the earth after thee after his kind and
[9:07] god saw that was good
[9:11] [Music]
[9:30] but then he noticed that he had nothing
[9:32] after his kind of his own kind oh quick
[9:49] and let them have dominion over the fish
[9:51] of the sea
[9:52] buff
[9:54] and over the fall of the air and over
[9:56] the cattle and over all the earth and
[9:58] over every creeping thing that keeps
[9:59] upon the earth
[10:01] guru never
[10:04] so you notice church that
[10:06] we the human race or children anti-faith
[10:10] was created for what purpose
[10:14] against
[10:15] to have the million
[10:58] then they found
[11:50] [Applause]
[11:55] and you know that is why as a church of
[11:57] god a nature full of angry cancer
[11:59] controversy
[12:02] to assimilate
[12:08] fire
[13:59] let me tell you we want to
[14:14] god to jail control that something else
[14:18] needs to take away
[14:20] god is no longer the one ruling over the
[14:22] church
[14:24] the church has repressed it with the
[14:26] constitution of the church
[14:42] according
[16:06] but then
[16:48] he's not gonna say what can i do to help
[16:50] you
[16:51] get into your original condition
[16:57] that is your original image
[16:59] furniture which we lost at the beginning
[17:14] [Music]
[18:12] their
[18:26] standing
[18:39] amen whereby every
[19:22] all the children that are born
[19:24] i would never die
[19:28] that's not the image of god you're
[19:30] saying hey
[19:34] that is why
[19:36] people who are
[19:49] in our churches macan saga failed them
[19:51] to know jesus christ
[19:54] many parents who are believers
[19:58] automatically their children are
[19:59] believers
[20:03] it is not so they shouldn't wait too
[20:05] until many of them
[20:07] can't take up their scenes
[20:12] until
[20:13] they themselves
[20:33] man
[20:34] has has had an experience and an
[20:36] encounter with god
[20:38] and sings
[20:40] no difference from the other peace
[20:44] he has no difference
[20:46] he may have the seed
[21:43] that right now
[21:44] my desire is after this series
[21:48] i'm just laying the foundation of it and
[21:50] we will go a little deeper the lord will
[21:52] give us grace
[21:56] i want you to be able to understand
[21:57] their characteristics that without the
[22:00] holy spirit
[22:02] we don't even have a right to be called
[22:04] a child of course
[22:25] why right because they don't have the
[22:26] holy spirit
[22:29] that is the holy spirit
[22:30] the holy spirit is supposed to be your
[22:32] ruler oh my goodness
[22:35] the world
[22:36] god is the ruler catholic
[22:51] but the way we are born
[23:33] hallelujah he came to god yes jericho
[23:36] and suggested to god
[23:39] everything was okay
[23:47] tell me a better wish than that one
[23:51] he had sacrificed his brother on a stone
[23:53] yeah yet i said
[23:56] ginger and now he was presenting himself
[23:58] before
[24:01] no difference from a witch
[24:03] [Music]
[24:05] and all of us are born with that kind of
[24:06] spirit and nature upon us
[24:09] everyone who turned their way with you
[24:11] but it was not supposed to be our
[24:13] original nature
[24:57] foreign
[25:12] image
[25:22] [Applause]
[25:26] hallelujah take it drop praise the name
[25:29] of the lord amen
[25:31] and so jesus
[25:33] comes here after the resurrection yes
[25:38] praise the name of the lord
[25:40] and and uh just take it one hour after
[25:42] that i'll just quit and continue next
[25:44] time amen
[25:45] hallelujah amen after the resurrection
[25:48] of jesus yes
[25:50] to show how important
[25:54] how important his death was
[25:58] of his death on the cross
[26:02] the moment he comes to his bill to the
[26:04] disciples
[26:07] no longer
[26:35] he showed them how he was crucified
[27:36] [Music]
[27:47] that you may be born
[27:50] because remember adam was taken
[27:52] was taken out of the east
[27:54] side
[27:58] hallelujah
[27:59] and jesus was showing them
[28:14] hallelujah
[28:45] [Music]
[28:55] the first eve
[28:59] was born that way yes
[29:02] but she's sinned
[29:04] i needed to pay a price
[29:10] a sinless
[29:24] why didn't i trust royal tidiness and
[29:27] who was it
[29:28] it was the king of glory
[29:31] god himself
[29:32] he came and took on yeah
[29:37] and then he paid the ultimate price
[29:41] on the course of calvary
[29:44] and so he showed them
[29:46] when he came to the decision
[29:48] to show them his name
[29:50] again
[29:52] and
[30:05] amen which means
[30:35] that
[30:39] they touched him
[30:42] and then
[30:45] my goodness
[30:47] there's something that is so much in
[30:48] these few verses
[30:51] concerned that we literally read only
[30:53] that and finished because it works for
[30:55] me down i have a lot of gods here but we
[30:58] didn't even cut anything you know
[31:02] a little progress
[31:16] my
[31:58] is
[32:13] it is signifying today children
[32:16] of this house of clay in the new mexico
[32:19] this house of christ and then you may
[32:21] enter spot your flesh
[32:23] that's the prison coming up
[32:26] but jesus he braved the breath of life
[32:29] to the disciples
[32:36] hallelujah amen which means
[32:38] you don't need to die to receive the
[32:40] holy
[32:50] [Music]
[32:58] [Music]
[33:23] of god

[1:02:44] holocaust they think it's just
[1:02:45] something separate from the message
