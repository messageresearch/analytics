[42:43] I've been blessed by this subject

[42:54] for us tonight
[43:00] amen I mean most of you already received
[43:03] motivated with how men already receive
[43:06] it is
[43:11] why do Christians suffer afflictions
[43:19] and I was taking a quote from the
[43:22] message
[43:25] the church age book and the message the
[43:28] judge age of small I believe it is
[43:40] I see this about on the projector if you

[43:45] gonna project
[43:46] um
[43:50] and I just have a small portion that I
[43:53] wanted to read for you there
[43:58] it says here is where you have to
[44:00] believe again in the love and goodness
[44:03] and wisdom of God
[44:05] you know
[44:10] these two is needful you know
[44:14] remember here demonished he said take

[44:43] might as well say Amen
[44:46] your father knows he who clothe us they
[44:49] really and feels the sparrow shall do
[44:52] much more for you oh yeah
[45:00] this physical things are not the true
[45:04] basic necessities of your life
[45:11] now let me ask you a question those of
[45:14] you who went to school I'm sure you will
[45:16] answer this question
[45:18] what are the basic necessities of life
[45:25] foreign
[45:57] Healthcare or medical or whatever it is
[46:00] now those are the basic needs
[46:04] but what does our Prophet said
[46:08] these physical things and intimidating
[46:11] what are the physical things
[46:19] a house to sleep in a walk Surah
[46:23] come on
[46:25] [Music]
[46:37] um
[47:03] oh I tell you I have drums and drums of
[47:05] what in my house I cannot
[47:19] I
[47:23] have a lot of food I have a garden of
[47:25] food
[47:30] some people in their house they think to
[47:33] be rich is to eat chicken and meat and
[47:34] their and fish every day
[47:42] but our Prophet has told us
[47:45] these are not the basic necessities of
[47:49] your life
[47:58] consists of the thief that's not a man's
[48:01] life does not consist of the things he
[48:03] possesses
[48:09] seek him first the kingdom of God
[48:13] and his righteousness
[48:20] it will be added unto you Hallelujah
[48:30] according to God all these material
[48:34] things of the world
[48:43] if he decides to give it to you praise
[48:45] God if he doesn't give it to you still
[48:47] love him
[48:52] it's not the proof of his love
[48:57] whether or not to give you the material
[49:00] things of the world
[49:04] those who have been following so far you
[49:07] have we have found out that the proof of
[49:09] God is love is
[49:14] elections
[49:19] raise the name of the Lord amen the
[49:21] proof of God is love is elections
[49:24] for him to prove that he loves you yeah
[49:29] he chose you in him before the
[49:31] foundation of the world
[49:34] but that's your proof right there
[49:37] so how many Allowed by God here
[49:41] hallelujah I mean if it is revealed to
[49:44] you
[49:45] in him before the foundation of the
[49:48] world
[49:51] that God loves you
[49:56] seek first the kingdom of God
[50:00] and his righteousness and all material
[50:03] Necessities
[50:07] how many of us every day when you wake
[50:10] up in the morning you seek the kingdom
[50:12] of God and his righteous
[50:19] how what percentage of your life is
[50:21] filled with how you will be able to get
[50:24] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[50:36] the reason why they are not blessed by
[50:39] God
[50:41] in their mind they are preoccupied with
[50:44] the with the with the uh with the
[50:47] material necessities
[51:46] this material Necessities as if it was
[51:49] the most important in your life
[51:56] all communities but I tell you we need
[51:58] to have a mindset change Karma Moody
[52:01] adrenal Jews and the words I have faith
[52:02] am I preaching to someone yes
[52:05] hallelujah hallelujah we need to have a
[52:08] mindset change to send the words I have
[52:11] faith do you agree with me brother
[52:12] Andrew okay
[52:14] brother Solomon you agree sorry we need
[52:17] to have a mindset change to choose them
[52:20] we need to stop seeking for this
[52:23] necessities of the world
[52:27] we need to stop seeking for material
[52:30] necessities
[52:33] this is not what I'm saying this is what
[52:37] God himself is saying
[52:39] [Music]
[52:43] fast
[52:46] kingdom of God and he is righteousness
[52:58] God can do many things
[53:05] that is
[53:10] everything he says in his word is
[53:17] to accomplish it he has to fulfill it
[53:22] is why we believe God
[53:33] condition
[53:35] testosterone
[53:37] 32 you will always fulfill his wife
[53:40] and here is what we are saying
[53:43] fast the kingdom of God
[53:51] hallelujah I mean let me find men and
[53:55] women younger men and ladies who are
[53:57] seeking for things in the world
[54:05] that's not bad
[54:07] [Music]
[54:09] for you
[54:11] know seek first the kingdom of God
[54:13] [Music]
[54:17] is going to give you food again he's
[54:20] going to give you clothes it's going to
[54:23] give you water it's going to give you a
[54:25] house
[55:06] you find someone who will always miss
[55:10] church service
[55:15] he's not there on Friday look down
[55:17] coming down
[55:19] most of us he come to anyone
[55:23] and when you ask him what is wrong with
[55:26] you brother
[55:27] the situation is not easy
[55:31] suffering seriously
[55:36] tell you things are very hard
[55:41] [Music]
[55:48] but let me tell you such a person
[55:52] seeking after the wrong thing to be
[55:55] Charmed and no matter how long it takes
[56:00] those things
[56:02] even when he attends them they will fly
[56:05] away
[56:10] God says the truth
[56:15] and if you want to attain we are going
[56:18] to be for now those things
[56:23] sick after the kingdom of God
[56:26] and he's right yes
[56:36] Hallelujah Amina that's what the Bible
[56:39] says one of the one of the of the
[56:43] Patrick said I've been young and I'm not
[56:45] old
[56:48] but I've never seen the righteous
[56:50] begging for breakfast
[56:56] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[57:04] righteousness
[57:09] so if you find a brother sister who is
[57:16] after the righteousness of God
[57:21] if you receive the Revelation you just
[57:22] shout a man
[57:24] I mean
[57:27] praise the name of the Lord
[57:29] and then God
[57:33] peace there is no one who can ever serve
[57:36] him or live for him
[57:39] and claim that your time was wasted
[57:45] you can never waste your time with God
[57:49] other people can make you labor
[57:52] and they will not pay you your wages
[58:03] if you work for God if you live for God
[58:05] if you serve God God will always pay you
[58:08] your wages
[58:13] so why do Christians suffer Affliction
[58:18] sometimes they suffer afflictions
[58:21] because they do not prioritize God in
[58:24] their lives
[58:27] because the suffering of a
[58:31] Believers only for
[59:03] Hallelujah I mean praise the name of the
[59:06] Lord
[59:07] are you following me Church
[59:10] the Lord delivereth him out of them all
[59:15] so if you suffer afflictions and God
[59:17] does not deliver you out of them
[59:22] one month
[59:25] two months
[59:27] three one yeah
[59:32] [Music]
[59:45] it is a cross of any belief
[59:50] God promised he will deliver you out of
[59:53] your Africa
[59:55] will afflictions
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:05] we find that one of us after him

[1:01:30] cannot stand before here
[1:01:32] come the time my brother
[1:01:35] poverty cannot smell on you anymore
[1:01:39] you cannot remain the same
[1:01:43] if you're being under the power of the
[1:01:46] Gods forever
[1:01:48] why do people why do Christians suffer
[1:01:50] foreign
[1:03:09] hallelujah amen I don't even see what
[1:03:12] they have
[1:03:33] they don't have visions
[1:03:41] things are difficult
[1:03:46] but whoever comes to the Lord
[1:03:48] they must suffer affliction
[1:03:53] are you following me now

[1:03:57] mind
[1:04:02] oh it's working on yours God bless you I
[1:04:04] mean
[1:04:13] but rather seeking first the kingdom of
[1:04:15] God and all his righteousness and all
[1:04:17] the material Necessities will be added
[1:04:19] down to you know
[1:04:26] hmm

[1:05:23] and by the time you reach Church
[1:05:27] several kilometers
[1:05:29] and you go to church

[1:05:48] and you just want to serve God
[1:05:51] everything the only thing in your mind
[1:05:57] and your friends
[1:06:06] 16 years later

[1:08:17] the people of God are not Material
[1:08:19] minded around
[1:08:22] say our Christ's mind
[1:08:28] do you know that many people in the
[1:08:30] world they don't want to do anything
[1:08:31] unless they know how they benefit out of
[1:08:34] it
[1:09:01] one again
[1:09:03] what is the need for me
[1:09:08] after all it is a you know it's uh it's
[1:09:11] not my work
[1:09:14] let them those ones who can but yeah but
[1:09:16] it's so good you find I always see
[1:09:18] brothers who come here and they clean up
[1:09:19] the church I was thinking about you
[1:09:23] I was really thinking about you
[1:09:26] you know
[1:09:28] that is something that you cannot do
[1:09:30] unless you're moved in your heart
[1:09:35] let me tell you something there is
[1:09:38] nothing that goes and noticeable for God
[1:09:42] whatever you do for his kingdom
[1:09:45] it is
[1:09:53] you were on his list
[1:09:55] for the people he is going to add
[1:09:57] something
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:03] hallelujah amen he said seek me and I
[1:10:06] would like
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:09] if you're christ-minded
[1:10:12] she will give you the materials
[1:10:18] he will never give you anything material
[1:10:21] that is if you're his child
[1:10:25] but if you're not his child
[1:10:28] foreign
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:11:10] so they do not seek the treasures that
[1:11:12] are below the Christians do not seek the
[1:11:14] treasures that are below
[1:11:21] amen amen it is absolutely true
[1:11:26] the majority of Christians are not
[1:11:28] worthy
[1:11:33] that's true
[1:11:48] not only because that God doesn't want
[1:11:51] them to be wealthy
[1:11:54] because they are seeking after the world
[1:12:00] I uh but but only if they were to seek
[1:12:03] after God
[1:12:05] I wanted to take your time
[1:12:09] if you don't have examples come to me in
[1:12:11] my private time I'll give you examples
[1:12:14] find Believers of this message
[1:12:20] in the things of in the material world
[1:12:23] moving and then look at their lives
[1:12:28] we look at it carefully
[1:12:30] you will notice
[1:12:32] they prioritize
[1:12:37] that's the first thing nothing comes
[1:12:39] before God
[1:12:42] that's what I've noticed
[1:12:46] their give us
[1:12:48] they give not only to the work of God
[1:12:52] they give the necessity of the Saints
[1:12:57] number three
[1:13:09] what are they made of
[1:13:11] that we are not made of
[1:13:16] good for thoughts
[1:13:23] right meaning so rather many Christians
[1:13:26] are on the Poor Side
[1:13:31] it was so in Jesus's day
[1:13:36] it was true in Paul's day
[1:13:38] and it should be true today
[1:13:42] oh it is not too true today for the
[1:13:46] Rhodesian Church age for the audition
[1:13:49] age is one of the vast wealth where
[1:13:52] often the Criterion of spirituality is
[1:13:55] an abundance of Earthly Goods
[1:13:59] um
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:12] my
[1:14:14] how rich the church is the goods too
[1:14:22] but how poor in spirit
[1:14:28] blessed be ye poor for yours is the
[1:14:31] kingdom of God
[1:14:34] the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink
[1:14:39] it's not Material
[1:14:42] it is within us
[1:14:44] a rich man is rich in
[1:15:01] God's regions that somebody had in
[1:15:05] Christ
[1:15:08] even if you are a billionaire but if you
[1:15:11] do not have Christ you are poor
[1:15:13] neighborhood
[1:15:17] but even if you are poor and you have
[1:15:20] nothing but if you have Christ you are
[1:15:22] the richest
[1:15:27] hallelujah amen that's why I believe as
[1:15:30] we must always be contented
[1:15:48] you will not stand on the principles as
[1:15:50] a Christian the principles of the world
[1:15:52] because of the love of money
[1:15:57] you will forget the word of God because
[1:15:59] of the Love of Money
[1:16:03] Christians make many many mistakes in
[1:16:05] life because of the Love of Money
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] that God wants us to have the money
[1:16:15] the Bible even said we should make
[1:16:18] ourselves friends of Mammon
[1:16:23] thereafter we have gone out of this you
[1:16:26] know world we shall be received in the
[1:16:28] Everlasting habitation
[1:16:33] it doesn't mean money will help us to go
[1:16:36] to heaven against actually sent us
[1:16:41] we will use it to serve the Lord because
[1:16:44] it's awareness we will use it as a means
[1:16:46] to live for Christ
[1:16:50] hallelujah amen money will not speak but
[1:16:53] Christ in us will speak and command all
[1:16:55] the material wealth of the world
[1:17:02] we should change our mindset to choose
[1:17:05] if you want to change your situation
[1:17:07] brother sister
[1:17:10] you must change your mind
[1:17:15] stop seeking after the worldly things
[1:17:20] speaking seeking after God
[1:17:23] it doesn't mean it should be lazy all in
[1:17:26] charge from Monday Saturday
[1:17:32] I actually do not believer the believer
[1:17:35] should be in the church from Sunday to
[1:17:36] Sunday he's a kind of situations
[1:17:47] and find time and come in the house
[1:17:52] that's why we have three services in a
[1:17:55] week
[1:17:56] and they are not like consecutive
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:09] foreign
[1:19:09] even worse than an Infidel why would I
[1:19:12] do any movie never cat videos anything
[1:19:14] you can never go in the Rapture
[1:19:17] how can you be worse than an Infidel if
[1:19:20] you will go to the Rapture movie
[1:19:25] you may believe all the doctrines
[1:19:27] foreign
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:20:04] you can say well I'm working
[1:20:07] I'm too busy
[1:20:09] that I can't come to church
[1:20:12] you have a problem
[1:20:14] oh I'm too busy with God I can't go to
[1:20:19] work
[1:20:23] so you see how how the word of God
[1:20:26] balances
[1:20:31] you see that's why even the gospels of
[1:20:34] today have made it easier for those lazy
[1:20:37] people
[1:20:40] you don't need to work
[1:20:59] you find them moving with kids
[1:21:11] even no idea of finding a job or
[1:21:15] completely no business idea but he's
[1:21:17] possessing possessing what are you
[1:21:19] possessing
[1:21:26] that's not the kind of Christianity
[1:21:27] we've been given Christianity
[1:21:31] you see
[1:21:33] praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:37] now why do Christians suffer
[1:21:41] so that way he Christ can make known his
[1:21:45] attributes to our others through us I
[1:21:47] want to know Christ
[1:21:52] let's read second Corinthians chapter
[1:21:54] one verse 3.
[1:22:02] blessed be God even the father of our
[1:22:05] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[1:22:08] and the God of All Comfort
[1:22:09] who comforteth Us in all our tribulation
[1:22:12] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:22:15] which are in any trouble
[1:22:17] by the Comfort where we we ourselves are
[1:22:20] comforted of God

[1:28:42] say I understand
[1:28:46] money hallelujah amen that's why when he

[1:31:44] delivered
[1:31:50] and he says and the old man as he stood
[1:31:53] there I begin to feel sorry for him
[1:31:59] Old Rugged
[1:32:01] courtesy
[1:32:02] my shoulders up the side of his to see
[1:32:06] if my coat would fit here
[1:32:11] I looked at his feet
[1:32:16] on his feet
[1:32:18] that's the all the way up as far as you
[1:32:21] could see
[1:32:23] where
[1:32:26] his rugged trouser leg my shoe wasn't
[1:32:29] nothing like big enough for him
[1:32:32] and I begin to look and I thought oh
[1:32:34] that poor old man maybe never had a good
[1:32:36] meal in all his life
[1:32:45] even begin to think about that brother
[1:32:51] because he himself
[1:32:53] in his upbringing he had a rugged life
[1:32:59] himself
[1:33:04] so he can Now understand
[1:33:08] you see why you have to go through some
[1:33:11] things that you go through
[1:33:15] don't begin to beat yourself up for the
[1:33:17] things that have happened in your past
[1:33:24] God permits it to happen
[1:33:27] so that
[1:33:29] you can't Comfort others going through
[1:33:31] this
[1:33:32] um
[1:33:36] praise the name of the Lord and down
[1:33:39] here I'll read the story for you he says
[1:33:40] oh the economics of the of Mexico is
[1:33:43] very poor
[1:33:46] The Brick Mason gets about eight pesos a
[1:33:49] day and it takes about four days to get
[1:33:52] a good hard labor to buy himself a pair
[1:33:54] of shoes
[1:34:02] is
[1:34:07] what does Pedro do working for about 10
[1:34:10] two pesos with six or eight children to
[1:34:13] race
[1:34:17] oh it's terrible
[1:34:20] and I thought after all that the devil
[1:34:24] has given him evil to Blind his poor old
[1:34:26] blinded eyes
[1:34:30] how cruel it was to him
[1:34:33] and I begin to enter into something
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:48] his head over on my shoulders glorious
[1:35:22] meaning glory to God
[1:35:24] and a man could see as good as I could
[1:35:31] the people begin screaming everywhere
[1:35:36] was entering into that Fellowship of his
[1:35:40] suffering in his blindness charity
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:49] you must do it
[1:35:52] before you pray for somebody
[1:35:54] you must enter into the fellowship of
[1:35:57] their suffering
[1:36:01] that's why even the bible say that Jesus
[1:36:04] is the high priest that can be touched
[1:36:08] by the feelings of our infirmities
[1:36:12] let me tell you nobody May ever
[1:36:15] understand your situation
[1:37:12] all right now he says you see so in
[1:37:17] Hebrews 4 14.
[1:37:21] seeing them that we have a great high
[1:37:24] priest
[1:37:28] that is passed into the heaven Jesus the
[1:37:31] son of God let us hold first our
[1:37:33] profession
[1:37:39] you can read it actually because
[1:37:53] for we have not a high priest which
[1:37:56] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[1:37:58] our infirmities but was in all points
[1:38:01] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:38:06] Anga is
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:19] TV
[1:38:25] because he said in all points
[1:38:30] now let me read something from the
[1:38:33] message which would stop shock you come
[1:38:35] back
[1:38:38] in the message the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:38:46] he says
[1:38:50] listen
[1:38:52] God had to suffer Temptation
[1:38:57] he couldn't suffer temptation
[1:39:00] he had to suffer sexual temptation
[1:39:09] he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation
[1:39:14] to be tempted by the devil
[1:39:18] in riches and powers and dominions
[1:39:23] he had to suffer all of that you're not
[1:39:27] yeah in order to do it
[1:39:30] he couldn't be as God in spirit he had
[1:39:33] to be God in flesh
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:43] but there is not nothing new on Earth
[1:40:49] the Bible says whatever is has already
[1:40:52] been
[1:40:54] yeah
[1:40:57] Hallelujah so whatever people are
[1:40:59] suffering today
[1:41:01] whatever whatever tricks and traps the
[1:41:05] devil is formulating today
[1:41:17] that's why he is our high priest
[1:41:21] while we are suffering through this
[1:41:23] temptation
[1:41:25] don't suffer they are silently
[1:41:30] telling you don't suffer silently
[1:41:34] don't be there alone
[1:41:37] and even fear to pray because you think
[1:41:41] you are a big time sinner
[1:41:44] let me tell you you must open up before
[1:41:46] the presence of God
[1:41:49] Amen whenever we have church here don't
[1:41:52] get closed in you open up brother sister
[1:41:59] needs to be with women and men crying
[1:42:02] and having tears amen of repentance and
[1:42:06] tears of asking for Mercy before God is
[1:42:16] knowing we are not coming before God who
[1:42:20] is in heaven with an iron road
[1:42:28] but you are coming before a high priest
[1:42:33] who understands because what you are
[1:42:36] going through he has gone through it
[1:42:39] before
[1:42:43] you two can overcome a recreation
[1:42:52] of Christianity
[1:42:54] is not one of sailing it is one of
[1:42:57] fighting every day we are fighting we
[1:43:01] are fighting against demons
[1:43:05] fighting against them let the
[1:43:07] principalities
[1:43:15] we have to fight until we overcome
[1:43:20] hallelujah amen until we said the very
[1:43:23] last drop of blood
[1:43:25] is
[1:43:31] let me tell you as long as I have some

[1:47:35] my enemies
[1:47:39] when I sit in darkness
[1:47:44] and the Bible says
[1:47:47] rebuke the devil
