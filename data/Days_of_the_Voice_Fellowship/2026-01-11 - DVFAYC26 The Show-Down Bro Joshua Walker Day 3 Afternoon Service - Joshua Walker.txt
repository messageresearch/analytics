And I made my way through some valleyies and believing I'd never get lost. &gt;&gt; I stood at the foot of what feel like knowing I have the strength for the climb. Through every desert, each test, there's one thing that's sure every time. &gt;&gt; Over and over, again, God is faithful. Over and over again and again through it all. He's made me able to stand and survive. To come through a life which should look like I couldn't win. &gt;&gt; Jesus is with me. I claim the victory over and over again. &gt;&gt; If you ask me why, I have no hesitation. God does what he says he will do. And I simply say everybody has taught me there's nothing he won't help me through. So I shouldn't dwell on the hardships and struggles. When I looked down beyond them, I see where this will end this with great celebration. And deep in my heart I over and over, again, God is faithful. Over and over again through it all. He's made me a home to stand and survive to come through a life. Oh Jesus is with me. I could trees over and over again. Over and over, again, God is faithful.

Amen. What a be wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I just want to bring the minister, but before I do that, I have some quick business to do. If you notice, I try to stay away from all these preliminaries. I always try to stay away from it because we don't come for that. We come for so I always want to go for what I have come for but uh some things you know it's good to do it to recognize those who have come. If we leave out anybody, you forgive us. But I'm going to do it by district. &gt;&gt; So um if you and I'm seeing that is I'm seeing a total of 30 districts and probably we will these are those who registered. If you do not register then of course I'm talking about the Ugandans. So if I mention a district where you you're coming from you please stand up. Uh and no one should clap you should clap after everybody several time. Amen. Sometimes I will do that and then you know people are excited so you can't stop them. Brethren from uh please stand up. God bless you. Looks like everybody wants to clap, but that's fine. I know Pastor Aaron, you know, mentioned that you were sending a bunch of young people. Had about 10 or so. God bless you. But I think it's okay to clap for these ones. They're coming from far. God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right. Also from Ginger, &gt;&gt; please stand up.

Come, come here. &gt;&gt; These ones you, brother Calb, come brother. &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Calb, you can you can represent them quickly. Run. uh brother while he's here because he's representing Mitana I have a message from his pastor who actually is also my pastor uh you know pastor me for several years when I came into the message and he said shalom good morning pastor bus we thank God together for this great success allow me to deliver my special greetings to all the ministers and the saints who have managed to come for this fourth annual youth meeting.

Pastor Pastor Leo also sent some little support for us and we appreciate it. &gt;&gt; And also believers from Wow, that's far. God bless you. I saw some of them today.

Maybe people don't know their districts. Anybody from Kataku? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, where where is everybody coming from there? &gt;&gt; Ah, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure this the believers from Nepak stood up under something else, but you're all from Kamoja. So, God bless you. I I say people don't know their districts. This is very serious. Toronto. No one from Toronto. &gt;&gt; Probably this safe town. &gt;&gt; Well, we say God bless you all. And uh yeah, God bless you. Bless you. Thank you for coming. Okay. Maybe everybody's from Wakisan campaign the city boys and girls. God bless you all. Now let us clap hands for everyone. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm having five more minutes here. Um, now before I invite a minister, &gt;&gt; brother Joel, can you please come right quick? I think um I will leave this other business uh uh for for the next service because I don't want to eat up much time. &gt;&gt; So, brother Joel, I'm inviting him because we skipped a very important part of our service. usually uh uh if you can step aside and wait for me. Uh usually on every Sunday morning in our church which was this Sunday morning which we skipped. I felt the atmosphere was just right for the world. We usually give announcements &gt;&gt; for what the gatherings of the people have been for our church land. And um because when we started the ministry about four four five years ago um you know the Lord laid it on my heart that we will not go to fellowship in a school. Not because the school is bad but because the school has a certain spirit. All who go to open church there usually they don't um you know buy land quickly. I think you will agree with me. So I said no I don't want to to to also be like this. And please, if your church is in a school, please I'm just speaking our vision. I'm not saying don't don't carry this over and cause problems at home. I I try to not cause trouble. And so, um, we we started in my house. You know, when we filled up the place, we got another little place around. We filled up the place, got a tent to fill it up. And now we you know we are renting in a a hotel in a hotel hall &gt;&gt; which is actually we can we had our first youth camp there can probably sit about 290 280 people and so we've been there now for three years now and but then God gave us this vision to start collecting fun. Most of our church member are young people. I don't know how many are inside cuz I know everybody's running around. Let me see if you're from DVF and you're here, please. They're all young people. &gt;&gt; Have you seen any elderly man? &gt;&gt; All of them are young people. &gt;&gt; But uh first of all, I want you to join us to clap for these people. &gt;&gt; As however much they are are young, they have supported the vision. So we started um I will just try to make the long story short. And so we decided, you know, to we were led to um collect funds, start a fundraiser to buy land. And uh land at the time when we started was about 150 and that was big. that we reach somewhere in the middle and and uh we we realize we cannot buy land continues to increase and we continue to use the funds whenever we have youth camp the last youth camp I used about 30 million because we we didn't have money so I had to run to land fund on the church and I spent it on the youth. That's how painful it is if you come and you don't pay fee. So someone will pay someone will take the blessing but why don't you support the cause. So um um so we you know we've u been doing it that way and it became very difficult and so I was in my office and I had even a headache how are we going to do this and go to the bank but they're going to give you a very high rate 21 18 the basis maybe 18 19%. They said we can't do this by the time we finish paying off the loan. we might as well buy another laptop. So then it was then that the Lord gave me this let's collect money weekly. God asked Moses, "What do you have?" He said, "A ro and God decided with that." So what do the people have? They may be young, but they have something. They don't have the big money, but they have something. We are not going to have a white man like our precious brother Joshua from Australia buy our land church land. All right. Because this is not his church. He also has a burden back home. we are going to do it ourselves. &gt;&gt; And and so and and so we um we made seven groups and uh these seven groups we made papers and through its psalm two. So everybody come and pick a whatever whichever you pick is your group. The groups were seven church age messengers. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Um, who's the first such age messenger? Martin up to William Brham. &gt;&gt; So now we have all the people I me I am in Martin Luther. So that's what I picked and everybody who joins our church we have team leaders can you stand up here seven of them you see young people you see you see around I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 six where's number seven somewhere ah seven I didn't see you sister so these people now all right so But all the same uh money that comes out from that's what Brother Joel is going to do to our church. We need to do it today every Sunday. So I had to explain to you and after he says it gives it in two minutes then I'll tell you how far we have gone two minutes. God bless you all. I greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ and you're most welcome to this youth meeting. Uh thank you for supporting us. Uh pastor has already given the introduction. Uh I thank God for uh this vision that he gave to our pastor and we are all standing behind him to see that this is coming to pass and I believe if the Lord tries and next time you might come when we have our own sanctuary. 23 for phase two. Paul contributed 130. May God bless you so much. Then Iranas &gt;&gt; contributed 50,000 Martin 90,000 62,000 Martin Luther 430,000. My God bless you so much. John Wasley 83,000. uh then William Branham William &gt;&gt; 164,000. So in in the total of the week we have 1 million 9,000. Uh so the the total we have the the cash now we have is 21 million 850 My God bless you. &gt;&gt; Which we actually don't have all that cash anymore because we've used some on this youth camp. But I wanted to say this currently there's a sister Susan. Where is sister Susan? She here. This sister Kim. God bless you. You know, we're in a church meeting and told them, "If anybody finds where land is, let us know." And she found the land. And she said, "In my neighborhood, we said land." And so we went and scouted it when we left just right on the road. And uh so we saw the land. Land was very expensive. Our target was 200 was 150 million. The land was for 300 million. But that's double. But you see without with faith all things are possible. So I went and met the owner of the land with a few brothers who happens to be a Pentecostal Christian. We told him help us serve the Lord. help us serve our generation and give them the gospel and and so reduce the price. Long story short, we ended up at 220 million and uh and uh we told him look at that time we had about 60 million 60 70. I told him we going to give you 100 million and the rest give us one year. He laughed. He said, "Do you think you're buying tomatoes?" Land you pay you pay 70%. And 30% you pay later, maximum three months. But our God is able. He never failed. This man finally he took the 100 millions which the 30 millions we had to find quickly find it when he accepted and we paid it. We paid it to him and we have given him some more. We are remaining with 75 something million. &gt;&gt; So very soon actually we have the first land title and uh well you can rejoice with us. It's a it's a good thing you know. So, so probably before our speakers return home, I would take them there. Uh, Pastor Tasha is an architect. You did not know that. Probably you could even do a plan for us. Who knows? For free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, well, well, well. But that's the father the Lord has brought us. And I know I've taken I've eaten up much time, but it's worth it. And brother Joshua, don't be nervous. You are at liberty. You don't have any time constraint. Just deliver whatever the Lord has given to you. And is that a man? We are here for camp. Oh, they might as well preach the whole night. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for allowing me to say those things. Can we now stand on Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a song I want to sing. and use our brother. You know, I told brother Michael and I keep calling you brother Michael uh you have to forgive me and I told brother Joshua that uh he has a burden for young people. But this is um a young man Just like I am always speak as a young man. When I say younger men, I don't mean spiritually. Don't misunderstand. I mean age- wise. But uh there is a generation shift. There's a changing of the baton. And brother Joshua, I believe with all my heart, he's one of those that God is going to use in Australia in this coming years in a mighty way if the Lord carries. And so he has an intense burden in his heart to preach the gospel. And I just pray that we open our hearts. I pray that the Lord will use him for our needs tonight. &gt;&gt; Sing along with me. Oh, all things are poor. Holy. Sing with all your heart. Hallelujah. All things are possible, holy. Sing it one more time as brother Joshua comes now. Holy. Oh, feeling. You may take your seats for a moment. Just want to say goodday like a proper Australian. We put good and day together and we say goodday. &gt;&gt; It might not translate well. But I want to say, are we happy? &gt;&gt; If we're not happy, we may as well go home. But I want to say because I won't say it at the end, &gt;&gt; but it's been a big highlight of my preaching life to be here. It uh hasn't been easy to come here, but it's been good to be here. We live in a country that is has a very high cost of living as brother Michael could tell you &gt;&gt; and I'm not one of the rich white men. I have a wife and three children and I'm the only one that works. So we're not one of the rich ones. But uh it's nice to be here &gt;&gt; and the reason I came because I have a burden for the next generation to come into what I have. And my prayer coming here was if I can say one thing that helps you, let me say that. I want to thank brother Michael for that masterpiece, that sermon this morning. Do we enjoy that? &gt;&gt; I want to preach like you. I want to preach like brother Michael when I grow up. He started preaching on the cross and again I thought somebody stop him. And I thought I'll be I'll be back in the maps trying to find something in the back of the Bible. But I want to just say this before we read a scripture that when I got married, I was 22 years old and my wife was 18. We had no money. We drove a beaten up old Corolla and my wife when we got married, &gt;&gt; she got a job because I wasn't earning enough and she made more per hour than me. Could you imagine what that does to a man's pride? But I worked more hours, so I took more money home. That's how I got through. &gt;&gt; But the amazing thing when he was talking about tithes, and the reason I bring it up when we had just got married, I took a week off work &gt;&gt; and I wasn't going to get paid for that week off work. &gt;&gt; And then we remembered we hadn't paid tithes for the week before. Remember, we had no money. We had no food. And we're like, well, we need food. That's important. &gt;&gt; I need to pay tithes. That's more important. And I made this the decision. I said, "Okay, let us pay tithes." And I want to say it's easy to say it, but when you have to do it, &gt;&gt; when you've got someone relying on you, And I wasn't going to be paid for that week off work. &gt;&gt; As I logged in on the bank, &gt;&gt; I had been paid for the week. I hadn't even done it yet. I just made the decision. So I want to say wherever you are in life, whether you got no money, put God first. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; I want to say a special thank you again to our brother Buzz. &gt;&gt; I enjoy your sense of humor. It's very Australian. Let's turn our Bibles to First Kings. &gt;&gt; I also want to say a very special thank you to two sisters. Sister Mary and Sister Shalom, they've been taking very good care of us. Shalom. We greatly appreciate you. Thank you very much for making our stay more comfortable. First Kings chapter 18. And before I read that, there's one thing I wanted to get to last yesterday, but I didn't get to. I was talking about the thoughts and temptations and I want to say there's no prayer that can remove the temptation. There's no prayer that will remove the thoughts. As brother Brandon would say, the birds are flying overhead. Just don't let them roost. So whatever that species of bird is or color of bird to you, keep it moving on. Amen. You have to capture it in your mind because the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind. First Kings 18:36 and it says first Kings 18:36, "And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said,"Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me. That this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. Then the fire of the Lord fell and it consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and it licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their face and they said, "The Lord, he is the God. The Lord, he is the God." And Elijah said unto them, "Take the prophets of Baal. Let not one of them escape." And they took them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slew them there. And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." And so Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount top top of Carmel, and he cast himself down upon the earth, and he put his face between his knees. And he said to his servant, "Go up now. Look toward the sea." And he went up. And he looked and and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go again seven times. And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said, "Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand." And he said, "Go up and say unto Ahab, prepare thy chariot, get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. A word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we've read your word and oh God, we ask that you come and add life to the words that have been read that may have an impact on our hearts. Oh God, come and change us. We pray in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the showdown. &gt;&gt; The showdown. This is a final test or a confrontation that is intended to settle a dispute. Down through the Bible, there's been disputes. There's two sides to a dispute. Evidence is needed to settle the dispute. bring evidence. But you can read in the Bible. Every time there's a dispute, God reigns supreme. &gt;&gt; And if you fall asleep on me, I'm looking. I'll summon the deacon. So, Brother Ramon would say that Elijah was going on a vision. said, "All this have I done at thy word." So in the Pergamian church age, brother Brandon would say, "Then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown." Carefully. Watch it carefully now to see it in the word. John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. He slanted the former reign and he was rejected by the organizations of his day. Jesus came and he had a mount transfiguration showdown. The second forerunner of Christ, &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and the creeds. For he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture. The first showdown was Mount Carmel. The second one was Mount Transfiguration. &gt;&gt; And the third will be Mount Zion. So now we can read in the scripture on Mount Carmel, fire fell from heaven &gt;&gt; and that fire falling from heaven proved that Elijah's ministry came from God. Elijah could have said a lot of different things, but when the fire fell, it showed that God was vindicating his prophet. And you read in the scripture, the cloud rose from the sea. What is it? A sea is a multitude or a church or a denomination. What is it? coming out of a church and then you see Mount Transfiguration that John the Baptist ministry of God. You might disagree with the ministry. But when God vindicates it, tough luck to you. &gt;&gt; A lot of people argue. God says that is my prophet. On Mount Transfiguration, the scripture says a voice came from the cloud. &gt;&gt; From the cloud and it says, "This is my son. Hear ye him." At the river, when John the Baptist baptized him, the voice said, "This is my son." and stop there on a mountain. Jesus was adopted as the son of God. So you can see now that like getting the Holy Ghost is not adoption. &gt;&gt; But getting the Holy Ghost takes you onto adoption. So you see now the tutor takes you onto adoption. So, how do I know I'm adopted? &gt;&gt; How do you go when your life falls apart? &gt;&gt; As we say in Australia, can you do you? &gt;&gt; Can you do you? &gt;&gt; What do you do under pressure? What do you do when something in life just swipes you? What do you do when someone sits in your chair? It's your chair. They sat there. What do you do? What do you do when someone side passes you on the road, steals your car park? Your reaction to life circumstances show your position. Or does the tutor need to come back to you and say, "Come on, get back up. Let's keep going." The tutor leads you into all truth. &gt;&gt; So you see, when God vindicates his prophet, you can't argue with that voice no more. &gt;&gt; So now we are coming to Mount Zion. And brother Brandon would tell us in the future home message, Mount Zion is always the bride. So we are coming to a bride showdown. There was a prophet Elijah in this day. There was a cloud in this day. So you start to see three showdowns, &gt;&gt; three Elijah, &gt;&gt; three clouds, and each time is God vindicating. This is my mouthpiece. So we can argue as much as we want. God does not require our opinion. God does not require our interpretation. And as we say, build a bridge and get over it. Tough luck. God does not need our opinion. Ask to believe the word that he has spoken. But so many people can't see the cloud rising because they're blinded by a prophet. Ahab was too busy looking at Elijah, too busy looking at the mistakes in the message to see that God was vindicating the message and they miss why he was sent. And I like that quote where brother Brandham says, "Pay no attention to the messenger. Follow the message. Why? Because the bridegroom has come. &gt;&gt; In the story of Elohim, &gt;&gt; Elohim, sorry, Eleazar Eleazar. When Rebecca came to Isaac, &gt;&gt; Rebecca didn't look at Eleazar Rebecca, I prefer you over the bridegroom. But the scripture says she got off the message and looked at the Christ. &gt;&gt; Got off the camel, shall I say? &gt;&gt; And I looked at her bridegroom. She didn't say, "Elas, you're more handsome than you've got the gifts. You've got the gifts." But she said, "That is my bridegroom. about paying no attention to the messenger. Follow the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see in Mount Carmel, &gt;&gt; they went and looked seven times. We've been looking seven times, seven church ages. And now in the evening time of the evening sacrifice, the seventh time I see a cloud rising out of a denomination. A cloud like a man's hand s Us Acts chapter one. The disciples are staring and the angel comes and says, "What are you staring at?" And they say, "See that cloud? That's what we're looking at." And the angel says, "The same way he left, the same way he'll return, he'll return for his bride on a cloud. Why stare and gaze? Our Lord has returned, for the Lord himself shall descend. with a trump and a dead in Christ shall rise and brother would say he does all three as he descends. &gt;&gt; So where are we standing? I'm expecting one Sunday morning for my loved ones to walk down through the aisle and they start telling me about the other side. Faith starts to rise in my heart. Set our wings to the winds of faith. In the evening time of the seventh age, I see a cloud. Christ is here. So, can I say the cloud isn't Christ? &gt;&gt; It's just identifying dwelling place, &gt;&gt; identifying his dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if he has descended, there must have been somewhere for him to go. &gt;&gt; I've got a ministry to declare his coming here returned in bride form. so full of love and the fruits of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; That Christ is still living after 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; Are we awake? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Brandon would say, "When the groom comes, will it not be the bride? &gt;&gt; Will it not be the bride? &gt;&gt; Will he will it not be the bride?" So people and there's a lot of websites against this sort of thing &gt;&gt; and people would say it's a fluke that brother Brandham took to vindicate his ministry. &gt;&gt; But to those with a revelation we say I see a cloud in the evening time of the seventh age. &gt;&gt; It didn't come in any other age. It didn't come in any other age, &gt;&gt; but it's my Lord up there. The Supreme Judge coming down, the glory of God coming down. Prophecy coming to pass. People desire the glory. They don't want the cloud. If you want the glory of God, you need the cloud. The cloud is identifying where the glory of God is. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, last start of the sermon, brother Brandham's talking about this cloud. He says, "Well, if you turn the picture like this and look, you can probably see it from the audience. Jesus Christ sees eyes here as perfect as could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge on all heaven and earth. The judge has descended. So can you see his eyes, his nose, his mouth? The congregation says, "Just turn the picture from the way they had it. Turn this away, the way it's supposed to be." He said, "He is supreme judge. There is none other but him." And that is a perfect identification. Again, identification that this message is the truth. God vindicating in a cloud. Once again, this Elijah ministry has come from God. He says in rising of the sun, &gt;&gt; he says that you see the face. He said it's turning to the right. This is right, isn't it? Right. &gt;&gt; It's different in Australia. We We're different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turn to the right. He says he's where he looks to the repented sinner. Is there a repented sinner here? So can I say you are identified in that cloud that when they turn to the right judge of all heavens and earth declaring you never done it in the first place. So let me say as the cloud is descending, &gt;&gt; let me accept God's mercy. &gt;&gt; Judgment is taking place for the bride on this side. &gt;&gt; Judgment taking place on this side. And brother would say, brother says says when you get to judgment, if you're not bride, when you get to judgment, he says, &gt;&gt; you'll be asked, did you know the truth? Because when you reject the cloud, you're rejecting the glory. You're not just rejecting a cloud. &gt;&gt; You're rejecting the supreme judge of heavens and earth who is coming down to declare you spotless. And when you reject it, you stand before God with a blackened soul. You stand before God as a sinner. You stand guilty. because you've rejected God's provided way. You've rejected God's righteous judgment. &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand it, leave it alone. Don't reject it. Leave it alone. I want to be declared guiltless on this side. Let me be judged on this side. Let me hear him say, "Well done." This side is available. The sin question is answered. It's not a problem no more. Sin isn't a concern no more. &gt;&gt; Sin isn't a concern no more. Let me go to my purpose. But the thing is there's two sides of scripture. There's a kora. &gt;&gt; And what is the attraction on the mountain? He says the attraction always brings the critics come to criticize. Some come for curiosity. But he says it also attracts the eagles &gt;&gt; because where the food is, &gt;&gt; the eagles will be gathered. And the scripture says there's a famine out there. &gt;&gt; There's a famine out there, not for food or water, but for hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; You must recognize what you have. You cannot recognize who you are &gt;&gt; until you recognize what you have. And when you and when you recognize what you have, you can go on to what you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Adam would say, &gt;&gt; he says Elijah had to accept what God sent. Elijah's expecting rain. He gets a cloud about you this big. God, that ain't going to be enough. But Elijah accepted what God sent. This ministry might look simple. &gt;&gt; I can tuck in with a seventh grade education and a Kentucky in with a &gt;&gt; with a bad family tree. But if you accept what God said, you stand before God as sinners righteous, &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ. So let me accept what he sent on this side and let me to be declared guiltless of this side while the blood is available because my backsliden brother. There's coming a time where the blood is going to leave that mercy seat. Stand before God with every sin you ever did in your life. For while there's time, while the blood is there, lay your sins at the foot of the cross. Lay your burdens on the foot of the cross. say, "Oh God, I'm pushing on the upward way." &gt;&gt; And people would say, "The message is bondage." And people &gt;&gt; people would say, "The message is I want to say eternal separation from God is bondage. Going to hell is bondage. death is bondage. So if the message is bondage to you, you just haven't fallen in love with the message. They say if you love your job, you never work a day in your life. I work every day. But if you fall in love with God, &gt;&gt; with the message, it's no longer work to go to church. It's no longer work to walk the right kind of life. It's no longer work to turn your head when a Jezebel walks by. your boyfriend. Amen. Just fall in love and you'll say, "I want to please my Lord because naturally in a marriage, a husband wants to please the wife, the wife wants to please the husband. And God has come down. &gt;&gt; And he says if you live this kind of life. This is a God pleasing life. Pride says I want to live a God pleasing life. Amen. Amen. So God vindicates his prophet. Our opinion does not matter. And then brother Brandham says when the seventh angel sounds all the mysteries are done but it's rejected. It's given for them to understand but rejected. It's given to them so they can go to heaven rejected. Why is because it's not in them to believe. I'm so thankful &gt;&gt; that when God released me from eternity, he put the word of God in me. &gt;&gt; That when the perfect word of God come, the perfect seed of God in me that responded to the word that sounds like home to me. is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Son of man will be revealed in a body of flesh. You people, the church, so they'll see Christ here on earth, not in the form they're looking for. Christ is here. When he looks like you, he looks a little familiar. Amen. When you look in the mirror, what is looking back at you? So, we have come to Mount Zion. Now, what is it? There's a denomination that's saying we are the bride. There's another denomination saying we are the bride and the name of the denomination. &gt;&gt; The name of the denomination, it tells me. Amen. The name of the denomination tells me where they stopped believing. I can see where they stopped. I can see where they stopped. There's a lot of different camps in the message. They identify themselves by their name. The thunders I wonder where they stopped. The two souls doctrine tapes only something in the bride says I've come here. Let me go a little further. Let me go on to adoption. Be ye therefore perfect. Let me go a little further into all things are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to skip over a few things, but when Moses built his tabernacle, he had to build it exactly like it was shown in heaven. The &gt;&gt; tabernacle had three rooms. Moses couldn't say, "God, I have a better idea. I need a sun room. I need somewhere. I need a kitchen in the tabernacle. I need a little sun room for me in the tabernacle. You had to build it exactly like it was in heaven. Designed in heaven, built on earth. If Moses had put his own opinion, his architectural twist to it, God never would have come down to that dwelling place because it was designed in heaven for God to dwell in. I don't want to I don't have the time, but you are a triune being. And when the tabernacle was completed, God come down in a cloud, what was he doing? Identifying, I have somewhere to be identifying his dwelling place. Psalm 102 verse16 Psalm 102. Psalm 102. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it to save time. When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. When the Lord shall build up Zion is Zion. &gt;&gt; I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Wake up. Come on. Zion is always the bride. The Lord shall build up the bride. Shall appear in his glory. Amen. What is he doing? &gt;&gt; He's identifying the tabernacle is ready. &gt;&gt; Know ye not? Know ye not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost. So the building is done. Down comes the glory. Solomon's temple. Down comes the glory. The message has come to prepare you to be the powerhouse of God. When Jesus was here on earth, he said the foxes have holes, the birds have nests, the son of man has nowhere to lay his head. But in the evening time of the seventh age, I see a cloud descending. Why? The son of man has a place to lay his head. The word is now resting. The word is resting in a multimembered body. But God is too great to be displayed in one person. He has a multi-membered bride attribute of God deposited into each one. They went each bride member back to their position. For without you, without you, we are &gt;&gt; without you. They cannot be made perfect. Each one has a part of God. Each one has a nugget of God. God is relying on you to bring that attribute to its rightful position has come to dwell in you. So don't go back to God sent a prophet. Follow the message. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God didn't come down just to be seen in the sky. God didn't come just to be talked about and debated to arrest him. Can I quote the message is in you as much as you let him be in you. You become the glory of God. God is saying the temple is done. I'm coming down, but it must be built through the open. You see why we had to have a prophet? We do. &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet to tie up every loose end so that the building could be completed so that God could look and say, "Now I've got a place to rest. If God can be in a burning bush, if God can be in a whirlwind, if God can talk through a donkey, talk through a donkey and be the apostles, if God can be in brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; can he not be in you and be the same God that was in a burning bush. I can't be God, but God can become me because God is too great to be in one. He's in a multi-membered body. Well done. Amen. I might sound crazy. I'm happy this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The purpose of God being so can I say the fire falling was evidence Elijah come from God. The voice speaking from the cloud was the evidence that John the Baptist come from God. Now we are come to Mount Zion. Is that what the scripture says? Now we have come to Mount Zion. So if we come to Mount Zion, God is looking for evidence. Who will be the evidence? Who will be the evidence that this Elijah ministry &gt;&gt; come from God? Satan is going through the earth saying where is my evidence? God is saying where is my evidence? You become the evidence by the life you live. You would have been stoned in the church ages. &gt;&gt; Stoned in the church ages. And now the word has gone further. There's no life in denominations. If there was life, there would be evidence of life. when there's no evidence of life. But as the bride comes into her position, there's evidence of life. The denomination has nothing to bring to the showdown. God says, "I've got evidence. I can prove that brother Brandham was Elijah. the bride. The chosen one steps the bride. You're not just some church mouse. You are the bride of Jesus Christ. Never let Satan put you in the corner. You are the audience. &gt;&gt; You are the audience of God. You are not some church mouse. Here's the evidence. Opinion doesn't matter no more. God vindicated his prophet. Cloud come down. God spoke. Here's the evidence. Amen. Amen. So they can fuss all they want. Did the message come from God? Didn't it? &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the FBI can prove it. They'll still reject it. FBI. They don't have the seed in them. The seed they have hybridized. They've watered it in. They've watered it down. And the life of Christ has been removed from the church. The life went further. And the bride said, "Be it unto me according to your word. I may not understand every revelation, but I believe every revelation. &gt;&gt; You don't need to understand it all. You just need to believe who you are and the spirit will lead you into all truth. And if it's required for a rapture, if it's required for a rapture, God will reveal it to you. You are the at the Mount Zion showdown. Psalm 132, verse 13. I'm going to read it to save time. Psalm 132, verse 13. For the Lord hath chosen Zion. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath chosen Zion. Psalm 132:13. For the Lord hath chosen Zion. What is Zion? &gt;&gt; He, the scripture says, he hath desired it. &gt;&gt; He hath desired it for his habitation. &gt;&gt; Who are you? The Lord has chosen you. &gt;&gt; Because he desires you. &gt;&gt; Don't let no one tell you. that God doesn't love you. The Lord hath chosen Zion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 14, he says, "This is my rest forever." Here will I dwell. Psalm 132 verse 14. This is my rest forever. Will I dwell for I desired it. So who are you? Desired of Almighty. God. You aren't just some church attendee. You are just some person sitting in the congregation. You are the bride of Jesus Christ. We have desired you. That's why we need the message. Because if you reject the message, God doesn't desire you because you haven't been built up to Zion. He can't inhabit the building if the building isn't ready. So he sent a prophet. He sent a prophet. And brother Brandham would say in the church age book, that the messenger of Revelations 10:7, God will vindicate his ministry. Preach the truth as Elijah did. We are ready for the Mount Zion showdown. We're the bride. We're not the bride. We're the bride. You're not the bride. There's a dispute going on. Who is the bride? But when God says, "I'm judging the world by my word. &gt;&gt; So let me summon the word. He turns around. He turns around. He looks my brother in the eye and he said, "Come forward, my word. Heavens and earth is passing away. &gt;&gt; Because the word is in him, &gt;&gt; he shall never pass away and here will I dwell forever. You have become as eternal as God is. Amen. God's great purpose &gt;&gt; preeminence in Jesus in Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we can say amen. We can see he did. But he wants to have the preeminence in the bride. But Adam lost it in the garden. Jesus went back in the garden. Jesus died more death in the garden than on the cross. &gt;&gt; And you know what happened in the garden? &gt;&gt; He prayed and said, "Not my will, but I will die." &gt;&gt; And brother would say, &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to stay with his disciples. Jesus wanted a family. &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted a house. &gt;&gt; But there was a greater purpose to him. You might want a lot of things. You might want to get married, my brother. But when you say, "Not my will," God takes you down the road to your purpose. Father, if thou be willing, remove this stuff from me. Lord, I don't want to go this way. Nevertheless, &gt;&gt; not my will, but thy will be done. And when he said that, &gt;&gt; an angel came, an angel has come, an angel has come to strengthen you. Read the word as you surrender your life. It'll lead you to Calvary. And the scripture says he prayed more earnestly. Blood, sweat and blood. And science tells us that deep grief they cause you to sweat blood grief this man was bearing. I've never sweated blood. I bet you've never sweated blood. We shouldn't bet. &gt;&gt; Just throw that in there, &gt;&gt; Australians. We shouldn't do it. Australia. &gt;&gt; Just making sure you're awake. I'm just watching. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says an angel came to strengthen him, to help him go through what was happening. Our souls were hanging in the balance. Brother would tell us in the revelation series, there is a veil of self-will. &gt;&gt; There is a veil of self-will inside each of us. I like to preach on that veil of self-will. But Jesus was praying He say, "Lord, have your way on this throne room." Heaven was his throne room. Jesus room. Man is his throne room. Man is his throne room. Three different throne rooms. But Christ, imagine this. Christ knowing full well what is to come. Will thine be done. I wonder if we knew what was tomorrow. When we say not my will. If we knew there was a whipping post coming, father not my will. If we knew your brother was going to spit in your face, father not my will. If you knew there was a cross coming, father not my will. He hadn't died yet. He hadn't risen yet. But when he said, &gt;&gt; "Father, not my will." The rest of it was a formality because the dove was leading the lamb to Calvary. It didn't matter what's happening down the road. It didn't matter what's happening down the road. God surrendered his will. And if you can surrender your will in the garden of life, in Satan's garden, the rapture becomes a formality for you. So don't stress about a rapture. Let me say this. You are the rapture. The rapture can't go without you. The rapture can't go without you. until the rapture. Just surrender your will. Let the veil of self-will be born in your life and let the dove lead you onto the rapture. Let me talk about the cross for one moment. The cross was the most painful way invented by man to die. Do &gt;&gt; you know the word excruciating it means from the cross from the cross. And sometimes we see pictures of crucifixion. They hang them way up in the air, but they didn't do it like that. They hung them at eye level. Eye level. hang them on a main road. So that everyone walking past could look in that man's eyes, see the agony, see the pain. They say the Greeks invented it. The humans perfected it. more than just feeling three nails. You would suffocate on your own blood. Not my will. He knew what was coming. He'd have to push himself up on the nails. trying to get a little breath of air, little breath of air until his strength ran out. Full back down on the nails, suffocating on his own. He should have died at the whipping post. Should have died at the whipping post. He should have died on the road to Golafa. But he said, "Nobody takes my life. I lay my life. I must get to the cross. Is on the cross. I must get to the cross. My brother, my sister, we must get to the cross. Get to a place. Die to ourselves. lay on me from this time on. Nobody takes my life. Lay my cause of the gospel. I lay my life down. Let me be the evidence of this message from God. Amen. I want to be the evidence. And they say a man could be alive for seven days on a cross. Jesus wasn't alive that long. She died back there. There she was on a cross because cursed is a man. thatth on a tree. He was cursed. So you don't have to be cursed. That family cursed power over the believer. He was cursed. You don't have to be cursed. Why has never forsaken? You never have to be forsaken. And if the serpent comes, if the serpent comes and tells you you are forsaken, the veil of self-will. He will that he never lifted his finger to summon angels because he knew the cross must men the breach for the joy for the pain and you endure the pain. You despise the shame. The rapture coming for the bride. The body change coming for the bride. Must endure for a moment. Rapture is here. You are the rapture. Amen. What was that joy? That there was a whole crop coming. Messiahs. &gt;&gt; Should I water that down? &gt;&gt; A whole crop coming. &gt;&gt; Of messiahs. And if that's too strong for you, let me say a whole crop of Messiah. The joy of fellowship, the joy of we're going back to Eden. But you can't go back to Eden until the veil of self-will in your life is torn. The veil in the temple was torn. from top to bottom showing no man could tear it. It took Almighty God to tear the veil. Now the power is given to you. If you lay your life down, veil can be torn. &gt;&gt; Amen. The amazing thing about the temple was the veil was torn. Quickly they had to close it. Quickly we had to close it. We can't let the people see that shakina of glory and the shakina glory &gt;&gt; has left the temple the people will leave church when they see there's no life in the church so quickly. Let us get an atmosphere pumping in this building. Let's get an atmosphere in the denomination. Let's sew the veil up. Let's get some entertaining song service. But when your word comes, there's no life in the way of glory. The shakana glory had left the temple. But quickly they closed the veil because the Pharisees were actors. We never want to act Christianity. It's a waste of time. We never want to go to church and fall asleep. My bed at home is a lot more comfortable than this chair. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let you drink. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The earth shook. &gt;&gt; Surely you have crucified the son of God. God, brother Brandon would say, &gt;&gt; "God was right in his everlasting covenant in the blood." &gt;&gt; Jesus who knew no sin. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I'll drink the cup, Lord. Sin came upon him that you don't have to carry your sin. So if you leave this camp, carry on your sin, your guilt, &gt;&gt; your condemnation, there's something wrong somewhere. Hear me plain and clear. You don't need to carry your sin. You don't need to carry your guilt. But on the cross, &gt;&gt; he cried. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't die once for this and forget about that. But he died once for all. So, whatever you're battling, &gt;&gt; whatever you're battling, &gt;&gt; whatever your fight is, &gt;&gt; whatever you're going through, &gt;&gt; it is finished. You don't need to walk out the doors with it. It was bruised so you don't have to. And then the scripture says he ascended up on high and there he is &gt;&gt; on the right side of the throne for my ignorance. He's not interceding for my sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; But little by little, our ignorance is being removed. Preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; Preaching of the word. Spiritual amnesia. Scales on the eyes falling off our eyes. I just want to bang your head against the rock. Bang your head against the word and watch that spiritual amnesia away from the bride. When the bride knows who she is, the rapture will take place. I want to go in rapture. Let me get the revelation who I am. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus decision in the garden paved the way. Something just come to my mind and I'm going to say it. &gt;&gt; When Jesus ascended up on high, he sat down on the right side of the throne. But when he was here on earth on the cross, he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they do." Faith is based on forgiveness. And brother Brandham said that Jesus believed the words spoken of David and he will not allow his holy one to see corruption. He knew corruption set in after 72 hours. Jesus went to the cross. believing who he was. Believing that in three days I will rise again because scripture is me and all scripture must be fulfilled. So bring me a drink. He didn't even want the drink. But he knew the scripture had to be fulfilled. He knew he knew. He knew that if he didn't ask for it, &gt;&gt; he could rise from the dead. You might not feel like some things, but if you don't do it, there's going to be no rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandon would say, &gt;&gt; "Faith is based on forgiveness." Jesus had to have faith in the scripture that David wrote to rise from the dead. So he said, Father, Father, forgive them. &gt;&gt; If you want to go in a rapture, you must forgive. &gt;&gt; You must forgive. If Jesus didn't forgive, there was no resurrection. You must forgive. It doesn't matter how painful it is. You might not want to forgive, but you must forgive. Father, forgive them. Father, &gt;&gt; I'm running out of time, but I got one more thing on my mind. When Steven was being stoned and the church members were biting him, &gt;&gt; could you imagine the church biting the pastor? I feel like it happens. I'm sure. But there he's been stoned. The stones are falling on him. And he says, "Father, standing &gt;&gt; on the right side of the throne, those who are sitting standing, &gt;&gt; Steven is getting a standing ovation from the master. Jesus, when I was on earth, that's what I did. This is my son. This is my son. When you go through things say, "Father, forgive them. This child and you can see Jesus standing on the right side of the throne. I'm going to close. So, brother Brandon would say in 1962, &gt;&gt; he says, "We're looking for Revelations 10:17 to be fulfilled. It's prophecy." But in what is the attraction on the mountain 1965? He says revelations 10 1-7 is history. So what happened in that three years the cloud came down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me take this for a last scripture. Isaiah chapter 43. Verse N. &gt;&gt; I want everyone to turn to this and I'm going to close. Isaiah 43:3 &gt;&gt; N God is looking for evidence. Isaiah verse 43:9 says, "Let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled, come to the judgment." He's saying, "Who among them can declare this and show us former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say, it is truth. Isaiah 43:10, "Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. Ye are my witnesses, he says. Let me skip to verse 12. I have declared and have saved and I've showed when there was no strange God among you. Therefore, ye are my witnesses, sayaeth the Lord, that I am God. Ye are my witnesses. The showdown has been won. God's evidence is on the scene. Revelations 10:11. Take the book. Eat the book. Testify. Prophesy over many nations and kindred and tongues. Take the word you've received. Take it into your heart. Prophesy over many nations. I am the evidence. I am the witness. Let this message come from God. But you can't give it out until you have it. So while you're here, &gt;&gt; get it in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "Let us run the race." &gt;&gt; Can I say we are in a relay race? You know what a relay is? The baton has been passed from a generation guarantee. It's been passed down and they run. They save the best runner till last such a time as this. But now &gt;&gt; when the world is at its darkest, &gt;&gt; God has said, &gt;&gt; "I've got my greatest runner. the fastest one. There shall be lights. Don't drop the battle. You disqualified the standard. I am the evidence. I am the wizard. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11. By faith, Moses, by faith, by faith by faith. And then at the end, it says they great men that they were they were great men, but they without us cannot be. Who are you? You're not just some church mouse on the back side of the desert. But you have a ministry. You have a purpose to declare to declare that this ministry is a completion for where is the evidence. Let the evidence come. I kindly I kindly think &gt;&gt; I kind of think he's waiting for us &gt;&gt; to finish the job. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the one next to you to finish the job. We are back on all the great men that were with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; All the great men with brother Brandham. They have passed on to their reward. &gt;&gt; Passed down to you now. &gt;&gt; You are the revival. &gt;&gt; You are the baton holder. &gt;&gt; Don't let no sin stop you from possessing who you are. So don't wait 40 years to give your life to him. Do it now. Don't wait till your deathbed and say, "I wish I'd done something for him. Do it now." &gt;&gt; While you've got energy in your bones while there's a life pulsated in you. Give me the pattern. Let me be the evidence and run the race to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God is looking for a witness. Can I say, can I say I have found the witness? You have become the message incarnate. You can't incarnate. Amen. Stand to our feet. There was a sister here yesterday who sung that song when he was on the cross. &gt;&gt; Is that sister here? Can you come and sing that again for us before she sings it? Let me say this. Could you imagine at the end of Moses' life? If Moses Let me just flip the scripture. I'm not changing it. I'm just own story. If Moses had become Pharaoh, if Moses had let the people go and then he gets to the end of time, he's at the judgment throne and a great big screen rolls down and it's playing out Moses' life, what it should have been. Moses would see the plagues in Egypt. He'd see the Red Sea parting see the bitter waters made sweet. He'd see it all. And God would say to Moses, "This is what your life should have been like. But you wanted the glory for yourself. You wanted to let the people go in your own strength. Moses would start sweating and crying. Say, "God, let your people go." God would say, "That was not my perfect will for your life." My brother, my sister, line your life up with God's perfect will. Because when you get to heaven, there's a great screen that's going to roll down. It will show what your life should have been your life to him. So let us look at our lives. See what we're holding on to will be to this might be the last time we ever meet. Let me say this. Preach the message. Preach it sky high, heaven high, the sin killing religion. Compromise. Never take the glory for yourself. Let us live a life for Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's coming a time that God summons you at the judgment as his witness and believe the message. Let that be me. God bless you. It's been an honor and a privilege to be here. God bless you all. Amen. As our sister sings this song when he was on the cross, &gt;&gt; there's no one among us when nothing on our own. We make mistakes and often sleep. Just come on flesh and born. But someday I'll prove just why I say. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm of a special kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For while he was on the cross. I was on his mind. M for he knew me. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God. &gt;&gt; Yes me. He whose glory makes the heavens shine. I'm so unorthy. such mercy. It's why he was on the cross. I was on his mind. The look of love was on his face. The thorns were on his head. Blood was on his scalpro stained in crim. And though his eyes were on the crowd, the day he looked inside. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; So I he was on the cross. I was so for you. You believe in saints? Yes. You love me. He who glory makes the heavens shine. Oh Lord, I'm so unworthy. Yes. When he was on the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was his m. &gt;&gt; Think about those words as you sing. Now that he glory Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. That's why he was the &gt;&gt; Close your eyes and sing it one more time. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Oh yes. You and I were on his way. Hallelujah. Sister, come back here. Come back here, sister, for just a moment. Hallelujah. I wonder if for just a moment in this atmosphere, we can close our eyes for just a few moment. God is about to do something. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just excited because it has been revealed to me, friend. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, sister, I don't know if you do, but I want us to sing Mercy Rewrite my life just look. I'm excited because Mercy is about to rewrite someone's life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Lord Jesus. Mercy re my life. You have fallen my soul on my life. &gt;&gt; Close your eyes. Lift up your hands. Oh mercy real mercy re my Oh, &gt;&gt; I could have fallen. &gt;&gt; Fallen. &gt;&gt; My soul, &gt;&gt; my soul cast down, &gt;&gt; cast down, &gt;&gt; but mercy, &gt;&gt; but mercy, &gt;&gt; reord my love, &gt;&gt; reord my love.

Lord, I am standing. I fall my soul. Mercy. &gt;&gt; Mercy. Now with every eye closed, listen. We don't plan it, but this is the most important part of camp. When the word that has been preached takes a hold of a soul. There are people here with us today that are prodigos. You had walked away from the Lord. You may not even have left church. But you you you know you are back. You had backsliden. You You're no longer having that fellowship. You had fallen. You thought your soul was cast down. But you have heard today, man of God, reading a scripture, for the Lord has chosen fire. The Lord has chosen you. He has desired you for his habitation. This is his rest forever. You are the rest. He wants to rest in you. He wants to dwell in you. He has desired to have you. This is the chosen time. This is the chosen moment. There's hope for you. It doesn't matter how far you are gone. It doesn't matter how much you have done. No one might know but you at know. Satan knows. God knows. But there is something that you know that Satan does not know that you and God know that you are going to make your life together. You are coming back home. I don't know how many that could be. It could be one I don't know. But listen, this is an invitation for you. Maybe you've been forced to come and you didn't even want to come to come, but you were here because you are his seat. He has desired you. You can't fall. The world is not your place. Denominations are not your place. The word is your place. The house of God is your place. This is where you dwell. God wants to dwell in you. Don't walk away from it. This is an invitation for you. And God is speaking to you. Come. Let us reason together. Would you walk from your seat and come? There is that thing on your heart moving on you is a spirit of God that just touched you by the preaching of the word. While everybody's in prayer, this is a very important moment. Just close your eyes and be in prayer. If you're tired of standing, seat, but let something be done in run for your life. There is mercy for you. &gt;&gt; All hope is not lost. 3. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The father is pleased &gt;&gt; to see you coming back home. Must have cried tears of joy. to see his boy come back home, to see his child come back home. God reveals his word in the season. To whom he chooses to reveal it, God chooses who he reveals it to. He chose that before the foundation of the world. All of his doings are fornown, hidden from man. He reveals them as he will. It is his chosen season. It is his chosen person. And he never did choose a party or a group of people. He chooses a person to reveal himself to. He's choosing you right now. Don't walk away. Come running back. There is mercy for you for you. Listen to other voice. You are his chosen. Doesn't matter what you have done, what the devil say. Doesn't matter how far you think you've gone. His mercy still remains strong is a gracious God. An understanding God one that is willing able to redeem you back you back and bring you to a place for you to understand not your works. his works, his righteousness that he has given unto you. You receive it by faith. Faith is based on forgiveness. He has forgiven you for your sins. Turn back to him and he will impute his righteousness on you. You are the generation of the righteous. Oh, thank you, Lord. If you have a loved one that you know has walked away from the Lord in this atmosphere, they can be restored. They can be restored. I challenge you to pray for them. I challenge you to pray for them. They can be restored. Come out. Maybe your brother or sister. Maybe your father or mother. Maybe your son or daughter. I challenge you right now to pray for them. They can be restored. Believe for it. Believe for it. Speak it. So shall it be. &gt;&gt; Because God is here. The right atmosphere, bad things will happen. The right time, the right season. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My seed reaw my I could have fallen but my soul cast but mercy rero my life. My soul says yes. &gt;&gt; Says yes. &gt;&gt; Says yes. &gt;&gt; My soul says yes to your will. Sing it again. My soul, &gt;&gt; my soul saves you. &gt;&gt; Do you crying to him? &gt;&gt; Just understand he's here to restore you. He has done that to very many before you and he's a faithful God. Oh, he is faithful. He is faithful. &gt;&gt; Sing it again. My soul, &gt;&gt; my soul says yes. &gt;&gt; Says yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, says yes. &gt;&gt; My soul &gt;&gt; My soul says yes.

Where you lead me, where you lead me, I will follow. When you call me, &gt;&gt; I will answer. Oh my. Please teach me to know your way. &gt;&gt; Listen now. &gt;&gt; Tell him, &gt;&gt; "Whatever it takes, whenever you want, One moment you choose, whatever your plan, oh my Lord, let your will be done in me. &gt;&gt; Sing my soul, &gt;&gt; my soul says. &gt;&gt; Come on, sing it now if you say yes. &gt;&gt; Says yeah. says yes. &gt;&gt; My soul says yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Says yes &gt;&gt; to your will. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Young ladies and young men that are here at the altar, everyone, please close your eyes. God knew you before the foundation of what you need to do is to stop trying to be a Christian. Quit trying. What you need to start doing is to have faith in God. If you could do it on your own, he didn't have to die on the cross. But because you couldn't, he died. He became sin that you might become the righteous. Now the scripture says, Abraham believed and was imputed unto him for righteousness. Now I want you to believe God from today. Believe God. If you have challenges, believe God. If you have temptations, if you have trials, believe him. Whatever it is, keep believing him and walking with him. He will lead you through. He give you an experience and he will lead you through. Give yourself to the world. Don't give yourself to attending fellowship. Don't miss services. Go to church whenever church is open. Stand the word. And I tell you what, he will lead you through. You don't have to worry about anything. All you have to worry is if you don't believe, just believe because he has done everything. All that is left for us is to accept sacrifice. You see, it's that simple. When the prodigal son came back to the father didn't begin to tell him about what he did, that was insignificant. The boy was still a son of his father. He just had lost the relationship. So you have lost the relationship with God. And because of the preaching of the word today, I assure you without doubt, my relationship, the fact that you are here has been restored and you're going to walk away. You go back to your church. You go back to your pastor and give them the the testimony of what the Lord has done. Now, let me pray together with you. A prayer of thanksgiving, loving Jesus. You're a mighty God. You're a holy God. I believe you're still filled with the Holy Ghost. These young people need an experience. Meet them, Lord Jesus, at the point of their need. fill their hearts. I pray Lord let them come to a place of full realization that you change to empower you convict because you have convicted them to come here Lord. It means there is faith in their heart to receive your word to believe what you have said and now Lord that relationship had been lost. I want to thank you Lord because you came because of them. We have had this come because of them and they're not going to be the same. For you have done a great work in their life. We just say blessed be your name. Thank you Lord Jesus. We commit each one of them at your hands. The young ladies and the young men, the little ones Lord, the older ones as well. You know them by name. Thank you for the word we have heard and thank you for the work you have done in blessed be your holy name. In the name of our Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. If there should be someone happy should be all of you. &gt;&gt; There is no condemnation in your heart. I want all of us to stand and actually we are going to begin the last service right now. I know brother shalom was supposed to take that shalom. Where's brother Enoch? Is he still in come? I hope brother Shalom has been taking many coming around the end. Let us stand and sing. Therefore now there's no connection. Amen. &gt;&gt; That Goliath is dead. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor Goliath is dead. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on now. Tell your neighbor Goliath is dead. Goliath. Oh, now I can't hear you. Goliath is dead. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Show. Tell Goliath is dead. &gt;&gt; Come on young people. I can't hear you. Tell your neighbor Goliath is dead. &gt;&gt; You know what we are going to do? We are going to usher in another preacher &gt;&gt; to now come and cut his head off. &gt;&gt; Well, we must rejoice about that. Thank you, brother Michael. Thank you, brother Joshua. Thank you, brother K. Thank you, brother. Goliath is dead. Amen. Brother Joshua, that was a masterpiece. Let us give the Lord a great great praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has been wonderful, having you at our campus. Thank you for coming. Now, next time you come, perhaps I'll buy your air ticket. Listen, the only thing I've not allowed these brothers to do is to spend money out of their pocket. But what I have allowed them to do is to buy their air tickets. I couldn't afford it. But let me tell you something. I could do what I can do now. And there is something we can do. I want deacons to come. You I did what I could, but you can help me to right dig into our pockets and you do what you can do. Don't just give, you know, 1,000 shillings. No. Make sure what you are giving is an a love offering. Take it from your heart. You do what you can do. Is that a man? Well, let me tell you, if there is something we can learn, one preacher came from New York recently, brother Simon Peter. Simon Peter, very wonderful minister. And he preached something to our church. He said this &gt;&gt; salvation is free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But blessings are conditional. &gt;&gt; Give it shall be given. Right? So if you want a blessing, if you want to be given, if you want a blessing, give right. That's what believers believe. So brother brother uh the brother will do that if the deacons can help with that. And this is not a force. This is not comfy. This is a love offering. &gt;&gt; Which song was that? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now listen, I know there are special songs that this is that. But at at 610 we are inviting the preacher. So if you want to go out before the preacher comes in to quickly ease yourself, you come back 610. But but the service song service is beginning right now. Mobile money. Well, those who uh need to send on mobile money, can you please can you flash the merchant cards? For those who want to send offerings, if you don't have cash, I was just told there are those who want to send &gt;&gt; please send uh those um uh things on the screen. &gt;&gt; Can I get it in a moment? &gt;&gt; You have it please.
