changed my life forever I was about 18 years old you know as a teenager you think you got it all figured out as teenagers but I realized I didn't have anything figured out but God rich in Mercy on our lives but he watched over us and brought us back to this place amen I wasn't ministering at that time but it was from that moment I would feel a call and I would actually run from it for many years

they're probably upset at me right now amen Genesis chapter 1 and verse one eins amen it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darknesses upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light and it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day um thank you Jimenez the brother in the states brother Jewel Forney he says you can't fight or preach in a coat it's like I'm just here to be myself I can't be anybody else and amen I just want to speak to you this evening on the spirit of God mood I'm supposed to be like just as I lift amen you know we're living in a very dark World darkness is coming greater and greater every day so I'm very thankful though in this dark time that we live in site in deviant lead but we have ever think but reading in our scripture about the Earth said it was without void without form it was empty it was desolate it was Barren it's about and foreign improved it was greater than the coldness that was upon the Earth it's about gloryside and light began to Dawn upon the Earth Unleashed began ourselves no doubt the Gloom in the darkness tried to hold his position kind of frogs but it could not stay because the spirit was greater guys amen then when you got up this morning the sun was in the sky that's the spoken word of God that's still hanging there today amen you felt this warmth as it begin to warm the Earth it stands there as a sign that the spirit of God is still greater than any darkness that it's greater than any lukewarmness it's greater than any Spirit of the enemy of course I see the geisters amen if we can let the spirit of God move the light will shine remember then guys God is least amen and when the light begins to shine take place the change of lives begin to happen when the spirit of God begins to move and the guys Amen brother Brandon would say it like this this is in 65. he said I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving amen I believe if he can be hungry for it we can be hungry foreign talk with me and I talk with them each blessing but even he said just what feeling out there with the spirit when it's like these guys and to see the conditions of a brother when Susan invention I have begun to feel us reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing for us we must Worship in the spirit unbeaten he said our message should be a flame of the hour as Dr Owens it should be the flame of our hearts amen he said if it's not in our hearts we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself it's like the guys must is so it's not just third word as if these little Vault but there has to be a spirit that follows the world he put it right there in Genesis 1. if we bring us the spirit of God begin to move the Geist God is the victors and then the word spoke and it brought it to pass amen so it's not just some intellectual thing that we have been passed down from generation to generation and the spirit of God is moving Among Us it's saving the laws and it's setting us on fire amen so he says you know maybe cancer has conquered you said maybe some disease he said it may look dark and gloomy to you now it may look like you'll never recovery it may look like you'll never get over it the doctor May say every hope is gone but standing right by your your side tonight ready to take you in possession stands the eyes of Faith who sees the victory over this Globus the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ you may see sickness amen you may see sinuses I see the

God's still right all clouds May cover it because the sun is still there Hallelujah it doesn't matter how many clouds are covering you today and you may feel gloomy and you may be in despair but I have good news the gospel good news can have the freedom of the spirit [Music] amen you can have the same confidence that the same God that spoke that son into existing God that is done in existence it is still hanging there it still defies the darkness it still shines he's the same God said I will heal all thy disease it's going to happen his word says He said you'll be delivered as Dr verse before it's going to happen it defies every sickness it defies depression the spirit of God is here to bring his word to pass the guys goddesses there be light that's experience [Music] you can see once again the Sun is up so the Earth was without form so the end of our own without void amen but the spirit of God moves over there guys god is perfect to see something that was void it was maybe

move on the waters the guys God has been Victor and the word spoke he said let there be light on we can't just have the spirit and no word because it is no good but the split Knicks neither can we have just word and no Spirit he knows it takes two wings to fly through gloves amen I can remember as a child we would have some chickens and some of them would fly out of the yard so if you wanted to keep them in the yard take some scissors and you would cut One Wing then after I forget [Applause] that's what the devil wants to do the Church of the Living God he wants to either cut the word off and we just bought outside cut the spirit to where you just running around in a circle in Christ but I have him to know I'm not a chicken hey man I've been given two wings and we can fly into all things are possible the kinds of America we can fly into the holy ghosts amen this is what he said in Colossians 1. you understand verse 12 passed through this giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear sons of the finstones in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins and the spirit of God Came Upon you the guys God has come out and it lifted you out of where you were too fast and it translated you into the kingdom of goddess amen the first light that they were ever given to the earth that is God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth that was God's spoken words he said let there be light as Dr asked me at the least it turned Darkness into life and it was to in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the Earth bringing seeing that ball of of nothingness [Music] there laid seeds that were in there and in this nothingness Hallelujah there happened to be a seed laying there and God knew he would have to send a light um generation in to call me forth out of the darkness Hallelujah he saw you he saw you in your darkness in your nothingness you was unworthy you couldn't do it on your own life begin to shine and the spirit of God began to move the guys out of the earth it was to bring joy and life to the Earth it takes the moving of the spirit to bring seeds to life that's why we can't just stand for a cold dead formal religion we must have the moving of the Holy amen [Applause] amen he said you know it's possible you can be sitting here it's like this is it and you have such a headache you can't hardly sit still oh do I start your cup smells he said and I wouldn't have no headache man I wouldn't I wouldn't know that you had one he said there's something dealing individual with you and he said and how the spirit of God can come down into a group of people making baptize a person in such a way and the power of God carries them to where they don't even know where they stand or the calf God is linked into an advisory and the next person sitting right next to the next next episode knows nothing about it help me Stefan Hallelujah I don't want to be that person despite the person I want to be sensitive to the moving of the spirit Specialists and zebra signs you know we have this cry Lord move in our church we need to say Lord moving me again amen we can have a moving of the spirit in the church because yeah and the geisters but did he move in your heart but before we realize it many times he's moved on by [Music] it's how many were there in the Bible with the woman with the blood issue they feel about him died and they were looking say Ah that's just Jesus found a mother a son of Mary and the son of Joseph no one's foreign [Music] might have father hey there's there's one feeling of the Holy ghosts there's many refillings I don't think I don't care how long you've been in this message we can never get to the place we know it Allah and feeling all of eternity won't reveal all of them because there's more of God for you that is amen maybe somebody said I need to renew it if you like him you need to refill it is [Applause] he will respond to their calls I remember I remember another man blind Bartimaeus there was a lot of noise that started happening foreign [Music] foreign but he cried even that much the more see the ones that were trying to quieten him they weren't blind he finally but he was blind and he said I have a name [Music] and brother Branham says that cry is a roof stop Heaven hopped in heaven he said Heaven stop it's like that he mentioned you haven't turned around through all of that noise he heard that little cry hot Eddie's incline and Husker here and he said bring them to me it's like bringing to me and the Bible says they go to they go to Blind bar the mass again yes and the master has called for the Meister the Bible says he got up and he threw the Garment down they begin to walk towards Jesus there was a faith in as Jesus is coming through this building and Jesus Come True Jesus just wanted to touch somebody Jesus and he's looking for that cry when that shout outs nothing to lose some of a lot of other people thought it was just a lot of worked up emotions just but they didn't catch the significance what was happening what was going on you know they disconnect they discount the presence of God many times yeah I'm off marketing my God is getting a as just being emotion I am emotional Stillness of God is Not emotion but it is emotional brother Brandon said I don't he told brother Eddie business he said no matter how many times the Angels Angel has come to me it's like it got to be off the angles he said I always feel like I'm going to die it brings emotions no man can come into the presence of God that was feeling amen you know a doctor said to Brother Bear I don't know he said do you think them people those Pentecostal people just excited it's like these are things that I might say no I'm best no sir I don't it's like nine he's the doctor said that's just nervousness they scream and holler and go on the doctors on the head he didn't even have roosters because he said Doctor you mean to tell me that nerves can be excited without something to excite them and it's like the doctor visits now from the guys something has to excite them it's the Unseen force of the Holy ghosts it excites that Born Again Spirit In Jesus it brings an excitement to that Spirit it Springs and guys the power of God God coming down through it enough God has come to health he said listen the Holy Ghost he said faith comes by hearing but the Holy Ghost takes the word but they're hiding against them just vote and spreads it out over the people so they will catch it is something has to cry out that must advice it's a deep calling to the deep that is amen hallelujah he said God help the day it's a god healful when we'll adopt theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Spirit you say well what year was that brother Timothy invest it was in the year he was a prophet it's like it's fighting amen [Laughter] God help the day God's hid it for him we adopt a theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said God help the day God healeth and him talk you take tithings from the church and sell it for 50 cents on a plate on you to give money to pay the preacherous he said God help the day so God heals when we substitute the upper room for a supper room [Music] the Holy Ghost preached back in his power and simplicity they're hiding you guys to look at Benedict in the eins foreign so do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some other Epistles of con Commendation to you or letters of commendation from you foreign for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart as is and such trust have we through Christ to godwardness to God not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life is so it's not just the word but you also have this have to have the spirit of the word the spirit quickens the word then the guys now the Lord is that spirit and when the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty the highest is in other words when Jesus comes then Jesus come the Fetters are broken then when Jesus comes Jesus comes chains fall off then our kittens Fallen amen blindness leaves lindtights good issues are healed amen blood issues a blue tall talk with guys cancers are healed oh yeah God heals cancer yeah yeah God's hide God heals cancer God hides Crips not just 50 60 years ago he does it today he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen amen somebody said a lot long ago brother Branham preached the gospel he said I do doctor it's like Mike here doctor said oh not that Divine Healing preach the word yeah he said the word is what I preach he said brother Brandon the gospel is the word of goddess I said not all together brother the Bible said the gospel came not in this word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy ghosts Amen to preach the word the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel Jesus doctor he said to interpret that that's the Bible means go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the word by the holy ghosts are getting out of the village on psyched the class the smartest house Hallelujah and when it's demonstrated by the power of the Holy Ghost I was convinced this demonstrated since signs and wonders will follow them will take place Deliverance doesn't take place salvation will take place the Holy Ghost will come and feel the vessels of God Amen but he said go preach today we say what signs we say what science what does that mean our vegetation we go to church we pay our dues our neighbors right that's wonderful but that ain't what Jesus says Jesus said these signs shall follow them that belief Jesus talked to dissertation foreign I don't care what anybody else says they shall lay hands and they shall recovered and they shall cast out Devils she's on the toy flow speak with new tongues noise words listen take up serpents it's like a demon drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and off the cotton league with a soliden that's the signs that Jesus said thus indications brother Brandon was saying like this in the trial he said the Holy Spirit should know because he's he's the uh uh uh the witness yes that's tiger he said the Holy Spirit should know how to get guys to be able to visit for here's the life that's in the word involved he is the one that quickens the word instead of both just like your spirit your spirit you know be dying guys quickened your body dying lightly Benedict without the spirit all the guys the body is dead it's the life truth the word is dead without the spirit on the Geist it takes the spirit expecting guys to bring forth the word and make it live and comes he is the quickener of the word it is well you say I don't know about all well just like just just hang on a minute yeah about my moments you know brother Bradham was in this place One Day in Canada in Canada it was a burn over Forest oh that was burn over and he got he got lost in the woods for a little bit it was on a moonlit night when it's possible and he said it was a very spooky place he said

in Tucson with her brother Doug Baker they put a duck Baker took me up into the mountains a year or two before they had been burnt eins so we're sitting on the side of this mountain looking over the valley um all of a sudden the wind began to pick up and he said you know I was looking at those trees it's like the shout out this ability where the Army had come through the canker worm and the Palmer worm and ate the leaves and he said I thought of that scripture she said these trees Put Me In Mind of some great big churches standing here but just as dead as a doornail the Bark's all taken off of them and the fiery trials had blazed all the spirit away from it is it foil again guys foreign message churches say in days of Miracles not just preaching the denominations preaching into US is

foreign [Music] foreign I love that story of the blind man he's sleeping because she used to find him blind and man the one where Jesus came and it was a different kind of service here come Jesus here's a blind man here comes that blender you know the disciples asked was this man born blind because he said or his mom and dad saying Jesus said no Jesus like the name he was born this way so the glory of God can be revealed the things you go through is only for the glory of God foreign my youngest son ban Jung stazon he was born with bad lungs his name is Andrew the name is Andreas and when he was first born when I said we thought we had a healthy baby this baby says in 2003. I was very young in the ministry and so I I thought we had a healthy baby I walk out to my dad and mom to tell him of a new grandson each schizophrenheit we hug and congratulate each other because my wife had to have a C-section so I go back in and when I walk in they're bringing him out he's now turned purple and blue and violet he couldn't breathe Kansas and they said we got to get him to to

Brandon would say this he said the great Shepherd was smitten it's like they closed the chef of course he was smitten back there and he said it is finished when he said that it's over I'd say that's not Divine sin is settled the penalty is paid everything is finished oh what an Easter veg and Austin's out there amen he redeemed us back to the original Garden where we were taken from I don't look at least he said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit his face and screamed for Joy foreign had to the wind shook the trees until they shook and jumped and joy together the prophet Shepherd had redeemed every name on The Book of Life and they saying that their nature was also redeemed and they screamed and they jumped as he's easy the girl went into an earthquake with the air the king in an airplane and everything taking place he said like any meetings when the shepherd reveals to you he said I've seen jumping spells and joy spells I mean help me jumping spells spells just jump I've seen okay I've seen it but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out the joy of the Lord fills the congregation I've seen my meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the things of the world foreign it's my imagination because they had recognized by the harmful is on the Book of Life his name is written down I have seen my name is Johannes when the book was open all heaven and all her yeah hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5. verse 19. it says quench not the spirit as not as as quench means to extinguishing them or to suppress to make it go out so in other words when it comes don't try to push it down don't turn it down in other words don't be a spiritual fire extinguisher foreign [Laughter] foreign we don't have to be ashamed of our worship didn't miss those feelings oh we'll have critics they'll call it rock and roll and then we don't have to be ashamed of talented musicians we don't have to be ashamed of the outpouring of the holy ghost videos we don't have to be ashamed of dancing and shouting we don't have to be ashamed of noise the approaches the prophet said wherever Jesus is there is noise so just worship Him anyhow yeah if Mama Ain't Gonna Worship I'm going to worship praise God I'm going to praise let everything let everything that has breath praise you even how many has breaths take a deep breath [Music] prize Glory you know in in in in Pensacola Florida in Pensacola Florida they have this Naval Base Air Force and I've been down there and these planes

said I tell you brother he's not going to split up when we get all the formal shackles shook off then realities is for melon captain my Lord's becoming and the spirit of God and the songs again on their Geist God is over there the leader this and get back to an old place where we can have the spirit of God moving again moving in guys goddesses the prophet can see a vision doesn't see him then powers of God will come in the church God is indigen mind then you will see Divine Healing then you will see the resurrection of Christ then you will say he's the same yesterday today and forever he said well you say I'm not a prophet he said maybe you ain't a prophet maybe you're not a prophet um but you can be an instrument an instrument he said if you've got no more than these ten right here instrumental he said you just give it vent to them as hard as you can I mean the clouds Will Survive you can't he said if you can be a prophet and Prophet this thing can't be an instrument an instrument do something to adverse to bring the spirit of the Lord to say guys Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah he said I'll say this it's like this he said when the Holy Spirit begins to move and the Heidegger guys begins his supervision to give discernment that is to bring the presence of God Among the people he said well brother Timothy the prophet is gone I didn't finish he said just like singing to him it's like is this game now shouting the message given an unknown time it brings the spirit of God Among the people a splinting guys goddess he said you've heard your pastor preach many times and he would preach unto the spirit God Among the people they would just scream out well see our minds couldn't hold their peace the spirit of God takes the word of God what does the guys God has lived us vote goddess to the congregations and it feeds them on this spicy so they can grow spiritually on the world so if we don't have the spirit of God so if anything guys God is least no matter how much word you got a god he's been vulnerable you cannot grow yes may finish that is the gospel it takes the spirit of God moving especute that's the guys to the people that's lost with enlightened so they can live so does this live in Canon if it isn't the spirit of God it is it's man's own intellectual ability and this is he said in First Corinthians 2 and verse my speech and my preaching mine was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom vanished that is mentioned but in demonstration of the spirit and the power so I couldn't bear them disguises on their craft that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men that's the advice [Music] he said see that's the thing that delivers the word he's like the word goes out that's what the Holy Spirit follows the world hiding a guy's positive vote he said your preacher or your pastor will preach it it's like the Imposter will just prayed again first thing you know goes hmm across the building goes the Holy Ghost it's the conductor of the word it's the food he said the word is the conductor of the spirit is where the word is preached the spirit will follow again wherever it goes with the spirit goes he said oh I love sound Bible teaching but the Holy Ghost has to come back and confirm it is he said if the Holy Ghost doesn't confirm it says then your wires are crossed but if you can get hooked up the right way to advise them there's two wires do I strike positive and negative positive for negative mechanics and Dynamics word and spirit forgotten guys spirit and Truth both as well Fighters if you've got them hooked up there is something that will move hey believe me I used to work with electricity when you got the when you get a hold a whole positive and the negative feather than positive something's gonna happen oh yeah you can be the quietest person on the earth finger becomes oh you can touch one of them did not happen nothing happens and nothing happens but if you touch both of them's gonna move [Applause] listen it's not just mechanics it's these numbers but if Brandon would say this he said I'm afraid we don't have well too long on the mechanics we must have both of them working together [Music] amen amen otherwise it's just a good intellectual speech this is I don't care if he screamed and hollered because I don't care if you talk real songs comes I mean you know we built a
