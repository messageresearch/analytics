[0:02] the Lord Our God spoke I'm reading
[0:04] Deuteronomy chapter 1 verses 6 to Aid
[0:07] the Lord Our God spake unto uh spoken to
[0:11] us in horrib saying
[0:13] you have dwelled long enough in this
[0:17] mountain
[0:18] and take your journey and go to the
[0:22] Mount of Amorite and unto all these
[0:25] places near there unto in the plane in
[0:29] the hills and in the veil and in the
[0:32] South and by the side and by the seaside
[0:35] the land of Canaanites and unto Lebanon
[0:39] and to the Great River the river is
[0:43] ready
[0:44] behold I have said the land before you
[0:47] go in and possess the land which the
[0:50] Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham
[0:53] Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to
[0:57] their seed after them
[0:59] blessed Jesus we thank you for the
[1:01] portion of the scripture we have read
[1:03] yes
[1:06] like a prophet tell us that every man
[1:09] can read uh they can turn the pages of
[1:11] this Bible
[1:12] is
[1:15] indeed it is true Lord maybe because he
[1:19] went to school and we know how to read
[1:20] it
[1:22] but I say that is only you who give it
[1:25] the Revelation
[1:27] give us Revelation tonight
[1:30] bless us in one way
[1:33] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37] amen me now praise be to God
[1:41] yeah this evening uh yes I was told that
[1:44] I want us to share
[1:47] together yeah we have uh it's our common
[1:51] scripture
[1:53] not common as in but it has been read
[1:56] multiple times in different Gatherings
[2:05] and uh I will take that very uh the last
[2:09] scripture we read where it says that
[2:11] behold I've said the land before you
[2:14] go in and possess The
[2:20] Landings
[2:27] my text is go in and possess the land
[2:35] praise be to God hope it is uh
[2:39] I think it's our greatest desire
[2:45] amen God wants us to go in and we
[2:49] possess our land
[2:52] and where we have read here we are
[2:55] seeing God speaking to Moses
[3:01] the Lord uh here they say the Lord Our
[3:04] God's back unto us in a horror they are
[3:07] remembering what God had spoken to them
[3:14] that's why if we keep reading the
[3:17] scripture
[3:20] we will know our promises
[3:23] because like that song say that every
[3:27] promise in the book is mine
[3:30] government
[4:04] foreign
[5:04] that all the rebellious will die
[5:08] and all of the innocent will inherit the
[5:10] land
[5:13] oh there we are they are straight around
[5:15] Mount Holly
[5:16] is
[5:18] but I believe some of them were reading
[5:22] the word
[5:24] they had a promise which God gave them
[5:28] from Moses
[5:31] praise be to God and they say the Lord
[5:34] our Gods back unto us in horrible saying
[5:40] you have dwelt long enough in this
[5:43] mountain
[5:47] ye and take your journey and go to the
[5:50] Mount of amorites
[5:55] they were comfortable
[5:58] where they are not supposed to be much
[6:01] foreign
[6:04] but God reminded them
[6:07] they remember the scripture they
[6:10] remember the promise because the prophet
[6:13] tells us that a Jew will only be blessed
[6:17] when it's in the right place
[6:21] in the promised lands
[6:24] be to God but when we are out of our
[6:27] Promised Land
[6:29] there's no way God can bless us
[6:33] and All Through the Ages
[6:39] we are seeing that unless they are in
[6:42] their right place
[6:48] amen man and told them tell me and take
[6:52] your journey and go to the Mount of
[6:54] amorites
[6:59] all the places near there in the plane
[7:03] in the hills and in the valley
[7:06] and in South and by the seaside near
[7:09] before
[7:20] I'm seeing something here
[7:22] the land which we were supposed to
[7:25] possesses
[7:42] in the plane and in the hills
[7:45] and in the
[7:50] South
[7:51] you have to possess all these places
[8:03] if you know you are right
[8:06] if you know you are inheritance
[8:09] praise the Lord maybe someone comes and
[8:12] tells you
[8:14] that your father left your land
[8:17] somewhere
[8:19] and then you are given a date
[8:21] then when you reach there say that oh do
[8:25] you know what okay I have like this
[8:28] other place the other place uh there's
[8:29] none of my business
[8:31] [Music]
[8:33] that shows that you are not
[8:37] seriously because when the encroach has
[8:40] come they will start with that pushing
[8:43] area and they will end up overtaking you
[8:46] know
[8:48] amen
[8:51] and say
[8:53] I've set the land before you again
[8:57] go in and possess the land
[9:01] which the Lord swear unto your father's
[9:05] Abraham and Isaac are from Isaac and
[9:09] Jacob to give unto them and to their
[9:13] seed after them
[9:24] that is the promise God gave to Abraham
[9:28] so this weather on the on their channel
[9:31] the promised land
[9:33] and God told them you have stayed here
[9:38] long enough
[9:39] they have seen Miracles
[9:50] amen all those things were good
[9:54] but that was not the main thing
[9:58] God had inheritance for them
[10:03] and God was expecting them to move
[10:06] forward
[10:08] and this is sample of our daily life
[10:12] we are testing about God's healing
[10:17] about God setting us free
[10:20] we have seen God doing many things
[10:34] amen that's where our promises lie
[10:39] all these things they are good believe
[10:41] it because if God is quiet
[10:44] we will not be encouraged but when it
[10:48] comes and drops these blessings to us
[10:51] it's like he's encouraging us to move
[10:54] forward
[11:02] so God was not happy with them
[11:05] and he came and told them you have
[11:08] stayed here long enough foreign
[11:31] of all the art passes over before you
[11:35] into them
[11:39] out of the tribe of Israel out of every
[11:43] tribe a man and it shall come to pass as
[11:47] soon as the souls of the feet of the
[11:49] priest that bears the act of the Lord
[11:52] the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in
[11:56] the waters of Jordan
[11:57] that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut
[12:01] off from the waters that come down from
[12:04] above and there shall stand upon
[12:07] and him
[12:09] yes
[12:20] um
[12:26] [Music]
[12:44] amen and he came to pass when the people
[12:47] removed when the people removed from
[12:50] their turn
[12:51] to pass over Jordan and the priest
[12:54] bearing the Ark of the Covenant before
[12:57] the people
[12:58] and as they bear as and and as they that
[13:02] bear the ark will come unto Jordan and
[13:05] the feet of the priests that bear the
[13:07] aqua dipped into the brims of cream of
[13:10] water
[13:11] for Jordan overfloweth all his Banks and
[13:15] all the time of harvest
[13:40] [Music]
[13:52] remember I told you that this journey
[13:54] was supposed to be for 11 days
[13:59] but because these people they doubted
[14:02] God
[14:03] they marveled against Moses and against
[14:06] God
[14:08] and God at one time want to destroy them
[14:13] stood in between them and God
[14:18] that if you will destroy these people
[14:20] what will the Heathen Nation say
[14:23] [Music]
[14:25] that their God was not even able to
[14:28] deliver them
[14:30] to God but remember when God sends his
[14:34] words
[14:36] this word will not return to him
[14:40] that word must accomplish it is
[14:45] God spoke to Moses and told him
[14:49] I will not destroy them
[14:51] God had another way of doing it
[14:57] turned into 40 years
[15:03] and all Bible readers know that uh it's
[15:06] only two whom it is the promised land
[15:11] those who are among the elders who came
[15:13] out of Egypt
[15:16] praise people
[15:24] at that time the Lord spoke unto Joshua
[15:27] make bishop knives and circumcise again
[15:30] the children of uh the children of
[15:32] Israel the second time
[15:35] and Joshua meant to him
[15:37] and circumcision of Israel at the hill
[15:41] of the foreskin
[15:43] and this is the cause
[15:45] and and this is the cause why Joshua did
[15:49] circumcise and all the people that came
[15:52] out of Egypt that were a man even all
[15:56] the men of War died in the wilderness by
[15:59] the way after they came out of Egypt
[16:02] more video
[16:04] welcome
[16:08] um
[16:36] [Music]
[16:41] amen Amina
[16:43] remember this too they had a land to
[16:45] possess
[16:46] your Korea go in and possess the land
[16:51] but there is a condition before the
[16:54] possession of the land
[16:59] here God instructed Joshua
[17:03] and told him to circumcise these people
[17:05] the second time
[17:08] remember this was the generation which
[17:11] were born in the wilderness
[17:15] because where we have read we find out
[17:18] that majority died of the elders who are
[17:21] those who came out of Egypt died in the
[17:23] wilderness
[17:29] the Young Generation were born in the
[17:32] wilderness
[17:33] [Music]
[17:35] they were not circumcised remember that
[17:38] the circumcision before the promised
[17:40] land
[17:43] again
[17:46] we must be circumcised
[18:21] [Applause]
[18:47] praise
[19:02] but all the people that were born in the
[19:05] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[19:08] out of Egypt then they are not
[19:11] circumcised
[19:12] [Music]
[19:17] for the chain of Israel walked 40 years
[19:20] in the wilderness till all the people
[19:22] that were a man of war which came out of
[19:25] Egypt which were consumed because they
[19:29] obeyed another voice of the Lord and to
[19:33] whom the Lord swear that they would not
[19:36] show them the land which the Lord swear
[19:39] unto their fathers
[19:40] that he would give us a land that flood
[19:44] with milk and honey baby
[19:54] [Music]
[19:54] um
[20:13] and their children whom it raised up in
[20:17] the uh in their state then Joshua
[20:21] circumcised for they were uncircumcised
[20:23] because they had not circumcised them by
[20:26] the way eight and it came to pass when
[20:29] they are done circumcising all the
[20:32] people that the that they are bored in
[20:35] their places in the camp till they were
[20:38] a whole and the Lord said unto Joshua
[20:41] this day have I rolled away the reproach
[20:44] of Egypt from of you wherefore the name
[20:47] of the place is called gilgal unto this
[20:50] day
[20:51] yes
[20:54] [Music]
[21:23] [Music]
[21:25] amen
[21:27] uh let's read
[21:30] 10 after 12. and the Church of Israel uh
[21:34] in the Church of Israel camp in gilgal
[21:37] and kept the Passover on the 15th day of
[21:40] the month at even in the plane of
[21:44] oh sorry of the month at even in the
[21:47] plane of Jericho and they did each of
[21:49] the old corn
[21:51] of the land on the morrow after the
[21:54] Passover and leaving cake and pastures
[21:58] corn in the same in self same day and
[22:02] Manna seized on the moral after they had
[22:05] eaten of the old corn of the land
[22:07] neither had the children of Israel
[22:10] manner anymore but they did eat of the
[22:13] fruit of the land of Ganon that year

[23:08] and the church the prophet said that
[23:10] come and let let cross the Jordan let's
[23:13] go over and possess the landing
[23:22] the trouble of it is with people today
[23:26] we are trying to depend on uh on
[23:30] experience they had about 20 years ago
[23:36] you know what happened to that manner
[24:24] it's not bad to mention that the past
[24:27] experience
[24:29] but we don't need to be comfortable with
[24:32] those experiences
[24:34] because the Bible tells us in Hebrews
[24:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday Guru
[24:52] [Music]
[25:07] foreign

[26:12] and we know that God is coming for
[26:14] church without spot or wrinkles
[26:18] and we know that when Jesus comes he
[26:22] will not step here on Earth
[26:28] we must be changed that will meet him on
[26:32] the air
[26:33] praise be to God so friends I don't know
[26:37] how you are I don't know where you are
[26:40] standing tonight
[26:41] but here is the message
[26:44] that God is commanding us to move
[26:46] forward
[26:50] coming to church
[26:54] God still has more we must grow in the
[26:59] splash of the perfect man

[29:26] Joshua went unto him and said unto him
[29:29] and now for us or for our anniversaries

[30:15] but we are seeing God reminding them
[30:21] you've stayed here too long you are
[30:25] comfortable with only shouting
[30:29] dancing in the spirit
[30:31] speaking in tongue but I want you to
[30:34] enter into the stretch of the perfect
[30:36] man
[30:42] where his presence is real
[30:45] Christian can reach a point Christianity

[33:57] good time

[33:59] but there's a time when you reach
[34:03] you want to see these things happening
[34:06] in your life
[34:08] that is the importance of reading the
[34:11] word
[34:12] because the message brings this God
[34:16] that is how he reveals God because ah
[34:22] okay he brings him more and more closer
[34:29] praise be to God and you see God
[34:31] operating in the prophet
[34:33] um
[34:35] manifesting himself amen

[34:45] praise the lord we have got to learn to
[34:48] possess please and God sent us go in and
[34:51] possess
[34:54] if you just belong to a denomination

[35:09] but no grandson and no daughters
[35:14] don't have that cartoon you just have
[35:18] sons and daughters

[39:49] what's going to keep us it is the Holy
[39:53] Spirit the holy spirit is the one who

[48:15] then he was looking at the heaviness of
[48:18] the Cross
[48:20] because God was going to reject him
[48:24] and he thought of quitting the cross
[48:33] and she was going to lose the whole
[48:36] human race
[48:48] but your will be done
[48:52] so sometimes this cross is heavy
[48:56] but Brothers quit as they don't win
[50:01] he told me
[50:10] whatever things fail Ure denied Saturn
[50:15] do you know the canes I will get
[50:19] you but if I leave my leg here
[50:24] even when I come back I will not be
[50:27] treated like the one who just who left
[50:32] but not to a True Believer
[50:35] Believers when we cross the bridge
[50:39] we are told to break the bridge
[51:12] or you die
[51:14] praise be to God Amen the same applied
[51:16] to the Church of the army of Christ
[51:20] remember we are fighting the battle
[51:23] which Jesus won long time
[51:27] instead of quitting
[51:51] we are in the army of the Lord
[51:55] we have to fight and win this battle
[51:57] today
[52:07] amen so we better decide
[52:13] ask God to give us the grace
[52:16] sir rather we are fighting battles every
[52:19] day
[52:21] yesterday I was thinking about I was
[52:23] looking at what I've gone through this
[52:25] year
[52:28] every year comes with his own challenge
[52:32] but one thing we are sure
[52:35] that when the enemy comes like the
[52:38] flowers
[52:43] praise be to God sometimes people say
[52:47] um
[52:53] where the Prophet says
[53:11] where he was saying that uh okay it was
[53:14] talking about Martin Luther King
[53:17] and say that he will lead the Negroes
[53:19] into that trap
[53:29] praise be to God and uh I was just
[53:32] looking at it in this way
[53:35] if you look at the tension between the
[53:38] blacks and the whites like in U.S mostly
[53:40] especially in U.S
[53:42] foreign
[54:29] in the world in
[54:33] and he said
[54:38] but take a heart if I have overcome
[54:42] our only refugees in Christ ages
[54:46] that's the only place where we are
[54:48] secured
[54:51] remember the grace of God is living the
[54:54] Gentiles
[54:57] and we know as God is winding up with
[55:00] the gentle dispensations
[55:15] may God fill each one of us with the
[55:18] Holy Spirit
[55:21] praise be to God that's the way my young
[55:24] brothers
[55:25] from I believed when I was in senior Too
[55:28] Fast Times
[55:30] and from that time
[55:33] I lived all my life at school for Christ
[55:38] my closest friend was the message book
[55:42] I never attended any sport game
[55:49] because to me it was a wastage of time
[55:54] but at least every day

[1:00:06] betray them
[1:00:08] praise be to God I do not have a
[1:00:11] girlfriend

[1:00:47] prayer
[1:00:51] until I married
[1:00:54] I thank God that God is still keeping me
[1:00:57] up today
