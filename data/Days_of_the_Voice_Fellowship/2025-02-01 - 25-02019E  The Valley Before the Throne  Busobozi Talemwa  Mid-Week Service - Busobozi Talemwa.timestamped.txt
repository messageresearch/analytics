[54:06] turn to the Book of
[54:10] [Music]
[54:16] Psalms Psalms 23: 1 to 4
[54:43] this is a very familiar verse um
[54:46] scripture rather many of you can recite
[54:52] it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[54:54] not want I think it's it would be
[54:57] beautiful if we all read it together
[54:58] just going to read uh uh verse verses 1
[55:02] to
[55:07] 4 shall we read it together
[55:10] now the Lord is my

[55:20] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[55:23] soul he leadth me in the paths of
[55:25] righteous nness for his name's sake yeah
[55:29] though I walk through the valley of the
[55:32] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[55:35] thou art with me thy Road and thy staff
[55:39] they comfort me amen amen may the Lord
[55:43] bless you may be
[55:47] seated so this evening I'm uh before we
[55:51] go to the word I just wanted to remind
[55:52] you the wedding of uh sister mlin
[55:54] brother uh is this
[56:03] Saturday so I'm I'm encouraging
[56:06] especially you church members come
[56:10] early I usually see that day or wedding
[56:13] day days especially here at church to be
[56:15] very
[56:19] important because we usually have an
[56:21] opportunity to have new people
[56:26] people who are not yet in the message
[56:28] who even don't even know what the
[56:29] message is all
[56:32] about so it's a a wonderful opportunity
[56:34] for them to know what we
[56:38] believe so if if not for anything come
[56:42] just to be uh a witness to someone
[56:49] new such a day I really would uh believe
[56:53] that it's not only about supporting the
[56:54] two young people it's also about um
[57:03] Outreach in Ethiopia I remember our
[57:06] first wedding brought in very many
[57:10] people you know they are there for the
[57:12] wedding of their family
[57:15] members so whether they want it or not
[57:18] you're going to preach the word and they
[57:19] will hear
[57:22] everything so it's usually a good time
[57:27] amen let us try to come and also come
[57:29] early you you members come early so you
[57:31] can welcome the The Strangers Among
[57:35] Us what what I don't remember the time
[57:38] what time is the is the wedding what
[57:40] time did you invite the people is it 10

[58:27] many people want the
[58:30] throne if you look at it
[58:33] politically you've seen that people have
[58:35] shed
[58:37] blood over the years simply because of
[58:39] the
[58:40] thr you look for example in our country
[58:43] the history of our
[58:45] country I remember when President M the
[58:49] current president wanted to be the
[58:53] president uh he was not accepted
[58:56] and even the current the the then
[58:58] president Milton
[59:01] obot spoke very big negative things
[59:04] about
[59:06] him and he even
[59:09] prophesied and he said that talking of
[59:12] says he will never test the
[59:16] throne and he was looking at him as some
[59:19] you know Village People
[59:21] whatever some
[59:23] nothing but now for the P more than 30
[59:28] years that is the same man who has been
[59:30] on the
[59:33] throne he was not without
[59:37] Bloodshed the man went to the
[59:40] bush um and fought
[59:43] war and you know many people were were
[59:47] dead as a
[59:50] result very very many actually we don't
[59:52] even know the numbers the numbers
[59:56] many paid the
[59:57] price both those who were
[1:00:00] fighting and the ones who were in the
[1:00:03] government and the local normal
[1:00:07] people they
[1:00:08] fought and others died but those who
[1:00:12] survived they eventually took the
[1:00:15] throne and we have been having the nrm
[1:00:17] government for the past so many
[1:00:21] years and we might continue having it
[1:00:24] for I don't know how many more years
[1:00:27] some of us we were born under the same
[1:00:31] government but those people paid the
[1:00:34] price they went through they had their
[1:00:36] own
[1:00:38] Valley you know before they got the
[1:00:41] throne if you talk about other
[1:00:44] people like Alexander the Great for
[1:00:48] instance was a great man he almost ruled
[1:00:52] over the whole
[1:00:54] world but you see this man
[1:00:57] fought he shed a lot of blood and then
[1:01:00] he became uh you know almost a leader of
[1:01:03] the whole
[1:01:05] world you talk about um you know these
[1:01:09] Roman
[1:01:11] emperors there was an emperor called
[1:01:13] Emperor
[1:01:14] Nero there are many many many world
[1:01:17] leaders there are
[1:01:19] many talk about also the Babylonian
[1:01:23] Empire there are many kings
[1:01:27] leaders that have at one point taken
[1:01:30] over the
[1:01:32] throne even you can talk you can turn
[1:01:34] and talk about the the west and and see
[1:01:37] the many kings that took over the throne
[1:01:40] in in Great
[1:01:44] Britain there was a lot of shedding of
[1:01:46] blood over the
[1:01:48] years then one would take the
[1:01:51] throne but you see when the King of
[1:01:54] Kings
[1:01:56] also wanted to take the
[1:01:58] throne he could not take the throne
[1:02:00] without the
[1:02:03] V he had to come down from
[1:02:06] glory and he came down in the valley of
[1:02:08] this
[1:02:09] Earth and he suffered and he was beaten
[1:02:14] he shed his own blood imagine the Bible
[1:02:17] calls it in the book of Acts the blood
[1:02:18] of God he shed his own
[1:02:22] blood and he tells us ministers to take
[1:02:25] heed feed the the flock of
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:30] God which he said which he purchased he
[1:02:34] saved and purchased with his own
[1:02:39] blood so the king of
[1:02:41] glory the lord of Lords the King of
[1:02:45] Kings the greatest emperor that has ever
[1:02:48] been the creator of Heaven and
[1:02:51] Earth he came he left the glory left the
[1:02:54] mountain he left the throne took the
[1:02:58] valley in order to now take the throne
[1:03:01] in the right
[1:03:04] way how much more
[1:03:07] us who are followers of
[1:03:11] him you know when you talk about
[1:03:14] life many people don't want to see life
[1:03:17] with
[1:03:20] valleys many people want to talk about
[1:03:23] life with only good good good times
[1:03:28] you know when if I if I begin to
[1:03:31] prophesy
[1:03:32] now and I prophesy only good
[1:03:35] things many of you will be very
[1:03:38] happy but if I can begin to
[1:03:40] prophesy and I tell you somebody things
[1:03:43] that might happen which will actually
[1:03:44] not might which will
[1:03:48] happen because some of you are 2019
[1:03:53] 15 things about to happen in your life
[1:03:58] some good some
[1:03:59] bad but you see many times we want to
[1:04:01] see the future our future as if it will
[1:04:04] only be
[1:04:07] good but there is always a valley Before
[1:04:10] the
[1:04:13] Throne before you attain anything good
[1:04:16] in this
[1:04:18] life there is always a value before you
[1:04:20] attain
[1:04:22] it there is always challenges
[1:04:26] sometimes there are times that seem as
[1:04:28] if you will never attain your
[1:04:31] goal you see a Believer has something
[1:04:34] that the world does not
[1:04:36] have a Believer has
[1:04:39] Assurance a Believer has Assurance which
[1:04:42] comes from
[1:04:44] faith believing that God is able to take
[1:04:47] and sail them
[1:04:50] through that's why no matter the valleys
[1:04:53] or the mountains or the ups and downs of
[1:04:55] Life are believer must always be
[1:05:02] joyful we must never allow the the devil
[1:05:05] to bring us
[1:05:07] sadness a Believer a True Believer is
[1:05:10] not is not a sad
[1:05:13] person yes you may go through tough
[1:05:16] times but remain joyful you might you
[1:05:19] might go through difficult
[1:05:21] time but always have hope because you
[1:05:25] hope is not in yourself your hope is in
[1:05:27] the Lord
[1:05:29] amen the Lord who made heavens and
[1:05:32] earth the Lord who does not
[1:05:35] fail so you see a Believer is
[1:05:38] solid a Believer is
[1:05:41] grounded a Believer is
[1:05:43] established a Believer is a believer of
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] word a Believer does not take the
[1:05:49] testimony of the
[1:05:52] situations a Believer takes the
[1:05:54] testimony of the word
[1:05:58] and so today I I want us to look at the
[1:06:00] valley Before the
[1:06:05] Throne that's why David said though I
[1:06:07] walk through the
[1:06:09] valley of
[1:06:13] the amen how many can speak like David
[1:06:17] tonight say I walk through the valley of
[1:06:21] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:06:25] okay I would like you to speak those
[1:06:27] words though I walk through the valley
[1:06:29] of the Shadow
[1:06:31] death I will fear no
[1:06:33] evil did you hear that I will fear no
[1:06:36] evil I will fear no evil meaning evil
[1:06:40] may
[1:06:41] come evil not made evil will
[1:06:45] come I will fear no
[1:06:47] evil why do we not fear evil because the
[1:06:51] Lord Is With
[1:06:53] Us amen and I'd like I'd like you uh to
[1:06:57] take you through the life of a man who
[1:06:59] wrote these words who said these
[1:07:03] words and I would like us to turn to the
[1:07:05] book of 1 Samuel chapter
[1:07:10] 24 vers
[1:07:13] 1 we can read from 1 to
[1:07:22] 7 and it came to pass when Saul was
[1:07:25] returned from following the Philistines
[1:07:28] that it was told him saying behold David
[1:07:30] is in the wilderness of
[1:07:39] Ang then took 3,000 chosen men out of
[1:07:44] all Israel and went to seek David and
[1:07:46] his men upon the rocks of the wild gods
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:59] so sa was an enemy of
[1:08:03] David because Saul knew that he was
[1:08:06] losing the throne to
[1:08:09] David David only one
[1:08:12] man but you see here is a
[1:08:15] king who took 3,000 chosen men out of
[1:08:19] all of
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:23] Israel to seek David
[1:08:27] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:08:29] shadow of
[1:08:30] death I will fear no
[1:08:33] evil thou with me and here is a man who
[1:08:37] said those
[1:08:39] words he's in a cave he's in a he's in a
[1:08:42] cave
[1:08:43] somewhere he he's in a you know a valley
[1:08:47] somewhere and here is a man who is
[1:08:49] coming to seek after
[1:08:52] his he's coming with 3,000 men
[1:08:57] strong man powerful men thirsting for
[1:09:01] blood I don't care how many men the
[1:09:04] devil has dispatched to come and seek
[1:09:06] after my
[1:09:09] life listen I don't care how many demons
[1:09:12] the devil has dispatched to come and
[1:09:14] seek after my
[1:09:17] soul I can stand here today and say it
[1:09:21] Is Well with My
[1:09:23] Soul amen if walk through the
[1:09:27] valley by the way let me tell you praise
[1:09:29] is wonderful when you're in a
[1:09:33] valley worship is wonderful when you in
[1:09:35] a
[1:09:37] valley don't wait for the
[1:09:39] throne begin to praise when you in your
[1:09:43] Valley don't wait for the throne begin
[1:09:47] to worship when you are still in your
[1:09:49] Valley because that is what confuses
[1:09:53] Satan canot understand a Believer who
[1:09:57] worships when they in a
[1:10:00] trial a Believer who worships when they
[1:10:03] in the
[1:10:05] valley don't fear those that the enemy
[1:10:07] has sent your
[1:10:09] away don't fear tell your neighbor don't
[1:10:15] fear and he came to the Sheep's Court by
[1:10:18] the way where was a cave and Saul went
[1:10:23] into cover his his feet and David and
[1:10:26] his men remained in the sides of the
[1:10:40] Cave the man of David can I have more
[1:10:42] sound in the in the monor please and the
[1:10:44] man of David said unto him behold the
[1:10:47] day of which the Lord said unto thee
[1:10:49] behold I will deliver thine enemy into
[1:10:51] thine hand that thou mayest do to him as
[1:10:55] it shall seem good unto thee then David
[1:10:57] arose and cut off the Scout of sw's Rob
[1:11:17] privy and it came to pass after word
[1:11:19] that David's heart SM him because he had
[1:11:22] cut of Soul cut
[1:11:29] and he said unto his men the Lord forbid
[1:11:31] that I should do this thing unto my
[1:11:32] master the Lord is Anointed to stretch
[1:11:34] forth my hand against him seeing he is
[1:11:36] the anointed of the
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:51] Lord so David stayed his servants with
[1:11:53] these words and suffered them not to
[1:11:55] Rise Against soul but rose up out of the
[1:11:57] cave and went on his
[1:12:09] way now I want you to see many times we
[1:12:12] think that our enemy is the unbeliever
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:18] devil sometimes your enemy can actually
[1:12:22] be your brother
[1:12:27] the devil sometimes can get these people
[1:12:29] riled up and
[1:12:31] anointed fight
[1:12:35] you but what what we are going to gaug
[1:12:38] you your spiritual growth
[1:12:42] by is the way you
[1:12:46] respond it shows your
[1:12:48] character it shows your spiritual
[1:12:52] growth it shows where you stand
[1:12:54] spiritually
[1:12:56] when your enemy when when someone a
[1:12:58] brother comes and speaks things that are
[1:13:00] not good
[1:13:02] about how are you going to
[1:13:04] respond maybe that's your
[1:13:06] Valley someone just comes and speaks ill
[1:13:10] against
[1:13:11] you sometimes even
[1:13:13] lies some people you know when they lie
[1:13:16] against them they feel so
[1:13:20] painful and they feel a lot of
[1:13:23] anger and they never forgive that
[1:13:26] person it shows you don't have character
[1:13:31] yet believer who has gone through things
[1:13:34] and God has given him character in his
[1:13:38] heart he will always
[1:13:41] forgive you will never have bitterness
[1:13:43] in their
[1:13:45] heart let me tell you a Believer is
[1:13:47] always free in their
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:50] heart never a spot of
[1:13:54] bitterness you should never keep
[1:13:56] bitterness in your
[1:13:57] heart you should always be forgiving in
[1:13:59] your heart you should always have the
[1:14:02] joy of God in your
[1:14:04] heart joy and bitterness cannot be
[1:14:08] together let go and let God rule in your
[1:14:12] heart and here is David and he found his
[1:14:16] enemy in the same Valley where he
[1:14:19] was but he did not kick him he did not
[1:14:24] you know kill him
[1:14:25] even when God had given him in his
[1:14:29] hand you know let me tell you one time I
[1:14:32] preached here a someon and I spoke about
[1:14:34] the importance of
[1:14:37] enemies do you know for you to
[1:14:40] prosper to go to the next
[1:14:43] level you need
[1:14:45] enemies you need
[1:14:47] enemies you need enemies not you want
[1:14:50] them you need
[1:14:52] them you need them even when God is
[1:14:56] preparing a table for
[1:14:58] you to enjoy all the
[1:15:01] goodies to enjoy all the
[1:15:03] blessings the enemies have to be
[1:15:06] there so if you say oh God kill all my
[1:15:10] enemies what about how will God receive
[1:15:14] Glory your enemies must be there to see
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:19] prosper the on who said you will never
[1:15:22] be
[1:15:23] married must there to see you getting
[1:15:27] married the on who said you never drive
[1:15:29] a
[1:15:30] car they must be there to see you
[1:15:34] driving the ones who said you will never
[1:15:36] overcome
[1:15:37] sin they must be there to see you
[1:15:41] change ghost the on who said you never
[1:15:44] make
[1:15:45] it they must be
[1:15:51] there give long life to my hallelujah
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:55] let them
[1:15:57] live they will see the
[1:15:59] good in my life amen that must
[1:16:03] be that should be he prepared the table
[1:16:07] for
[1:16:08] us in the
[1:16:11] presence David never killed his
[1:16:15] enemy he said God is
[1:16:18] Anointed I cannot stretch my hand
[1:16:21] against don't be quick to judge and to
[1:16:24] curse and to do those
[1:16:29] things but David at this time had run
[1:16:33] for refuge in the
[1:16:35] valley he was at the lowest in his
[1:16:39] life felt hunted like a
[1:16:44] dog but he was to be a
[1:16:47] king doesn't matter his current
[1:16:51] state he was running he looked like a
[1:16:55] fugitive but this man was to be a
[1:16:58] king he was actually already a
[1:17:02] king even though he had no
[1:17:05] Throne right now I am looking at some
[1:17:10] Kings even though we don't see the
[1:17:13] throne that's why brethren we must walk
[1:17:15] by faith not by
[1:17:19] side we are already
[1:17:22] Kings this man was already a king
[1:17:25] why because God had already done choose
[1:17:29] him praise the
[1:17:32] Lord amen let's go to First Samuel and
[1:17:35] look at
[1:17:37] it vers 6 chapter 16 and it came to pass
[1:17:42] when they were Cal that he looked on
[1:17:44] Arab and said surely the Lord is God the
[1:17:47] Lord is Anointed is before
[1:17:49] him you can read verse by
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:53] verse 166 166 sorry 166 now this is
[1:17:59] Samuel uh after going to the to the
[1:18:02] house of the of of U of um uh David's
[1:18:07] father and it says it came to pass when
[1:18:10] they were come that he looked onab and
[1:18:12] said surely the Lord is Anointed is
[1:18:14] before
[1:18:21] him but the Lord said unto Samuel look
[1:18:24] not on his countenance or on his height
[1:18:27] of his sture because I have refused him
[1:18:30] for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for
[1:18:32] man lookth on the outward appearance but
[1:18:34] the Lord lookth on the
[1:18:52] heart you see
[1:18:56] when he was instructed now listen I want
[1:18:58] this is very
[1:18:59] amazing when Jess was instructed to call
[1:19:02] his
[1:19:04] children he called all his
[1:19:07] children but he left David
[1:19:10] out so even Jesse did not choose any of
[1:19:14] did not choose David as one of his
[1:19:18] sons because he did not find him worthy
[1:19:20] to be a
[1:19:23] king when the the prophet
[1:19:26] came the moment he
[1:19:31] saw he was
[1:19:34] satisfied and he said behold the Lord is
[1:19:40] Anointed even the prophet of
[1:19:43] God did not find David
[1:19:47] worthy that's why the Lord came down and
[1:19:50] told
[1:19:52] Samuel let not look at the
[1:19:56] continence don't look at the height and
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:58] stru because I have
[1:20:01] refused for the Lord does not see as man
[1:20:04] see
[1:20:05] it man may see you the way you are
[1:20:08] now but God does not see you the way you
[1:20:12] are God sees you the way he chose you
[1:20:17] am hallelujah amen and how did God
[1:20:20] choose
[1:20:21] you amen like you know God not have
[1:20:25] before he
[1:20:28] chose there were no many
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:32] options no there was only
[1:20:35] him there were not
[1:20:38] many for him to choose
[1:20:40] from you get a point there was only
[1:20:45] God so if he chose you he must have
[1:20:48] chose chosen you in
[1:20:52] him which means he CH
[1:20:56] himself which means you were already
[1:20:59] perfect so when he sees you he sees
[1:21:03] himself when he sees you he sees his
[1:21:06] glory when he sees you he sees
[1:21:09] Perfection when he sees he doesn't see
[1:21:13] poverty when he sees he doesn't see
[1:21:16] lack when he sees he doesn't see
[1:21:19] tears when he sees he doesn't see
[1:21:21] suffering when he sees you he sees him
[1:21:27] because he says is all in
[1:21:29] all all
[1:21:32] sufficient he's the Alpha and Omega so
[1:21:35] when he sees you when he sees me he sees
[1:21:39] exactly what he
[1:21:43] is can God
[1:21:45] fail God cannot fail so when he sees me
[1:21:49] he sees possibilities
[1:21:52] only he does not see imposs
[1:21:56] when he sees
[1:21:57] you
[1:22:01] impurities he sees
[1:22:04] Pur he sees
[1:22:08] Perfection stop looking at
[1:22:12] yourself that's why many of you can't
[1:22:14] even worship God and serve him the the
[1:22:16] way you
[1:22:19] ow because you have never settled the
[1:22:21] sin
[1:22:23] question you've always looked at
[1:22:25] yourself as a little
[1:22:27] sinner as someone who is
[1:22:30] insufficient as someone who is really
[1:22:32] needing a lot
[1:22:34] of you know to be forgiven but when God
[1:22:37] sees you he doesn't see any of
[1:22:42] that by the way that empowers
[1:22:45] you when you get to understand that then
[1:22:49] it empowers you so you begin to
[1:22:52] ignore all the Imp
[1:22:57] you begin to
[1:23:00] ignore all your condition you think you
[1:23:03] are
[1:23:05] in when God saw David from the very
[1:23:09] beginning God saw
[1:23:13] himself God saw
[1:23:15] Perfection God saw a
[1:23:18] keing because God himself is a king of
[1:23:21] kings so that's why when he he talk to
[1:23:25] David David I give you a kingdom Without
[1:23:31] End why because God saw
[1:23:34] himself in
[1:23:38] David but David himself saw a little
[1:23:42] Rudy
[1:23:44] boy his father saw a little poor
[1:23:48] boy his brothers as we shall see as we
[1:23:51] continue they despised him
[1:23:56] the
[1:23:57] prophet he didn't even think about
[1:24:00] him when he
[1:24:03] saw if we live here we can't go nowhere
[1:24:07] this is the one because when you look at
[1:24:11] the way is wide large big the height
[1:24:15] Aman height American
[1:24:17] height when I see the eyes I see they

[1:24:26] cheeks they are really the ones the
[1:24:29] mouth the lips the teeth all the te are
[1:24:33] there the hair it is all good that one
[1:24:38] is the
[1:24:39] king he opened his mouth and said
[1:24:48] surely Prophet prophet
[1:24:52] samel he failed to see what God
[1:24:58] even your preacher your pastor can fail
[1:24:59] to see
[1:25:04] what that is
[1:25:06] shocking you can fail to see what God is
[1:25:09] [Applause]

[1:25:13] God is
[1:25:15] saying there is more in
[1:25:18] you and what we
[1:25:21] see I fail to see I fail to see what God
[1:25:25] is
[1:25:27] seeing but nothing of my failure can
[1:25:30] hinder what I'm supposed to

[1:44:54] God chose us in
[1:44:55] him that we should be holy and Without
[1:44:57] Blame before him
[1:44:59] in David was distin for the
[1:45:03] throne he had always been a part of
[1:45:05] God's
[1:45:07] plan I was the for the
[1:45:11] throne I was always a part of
[1:45:13] God I came from God I go
[1:45:17] back and I see here God announces to SA
[1:45:24] about
[1:45:26] David and I I will read it to you and
[1:45:28] then I'll ask you a
[1:45:30] question but now 1 13:4 says but now the
[1:45:35] kingdom shall not
[1:45:38] continue the Lord has s him a man after
[1:45:41] his own
[1:45:43] heart and the Lord has commanded him to
[1:45:45] be Captain over his
[1:45:48] people because thou has kept not kept
[1:45:51] the word which the Lord commanded thee
[1:45:55] I want to ask you a question when God
[1:45:57] was speaking this to
[1:45:59] sa where was
[1:46:02] David anybody
[1:46:06] knows come on
[1:46:09] now he was in the
[1:46:11] valley somewhere feeding the
[1:46:14] ship but God
[1:46:17] spoke and
[1:46:19] announc that God s him a man after his
[1:46:25] your coming here was announced before
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:30] came even if your mother tried it they
[1:46:32] could not not AB
[1:46:38] you it is impossible you were supposed
[1:46:41] to be
[1:46:42] here I was supposed to be here I was
[1:46:46] announced
[1:46:48] before and my time has come and I'm here
[1:46:53] God has announced me before I it doesn't
[1:46:55] matter where you are that
[1:46:58] moment but I want to tell you for sure
[1:47:01] in the mind of
[1:47:02] God at this time David was stilling the
[1:47:06] value of his
[1:47:08] life but God had David in
[1:47:12] mind he was a part of God's
[1:47:15] plan when sa was being selected as a
[1:47:20] King David was a shepherd for
[1:47:24] ship when David's brothers were Renown
[1:47:27] soldiers in the
[1:47:30] Army David was protecting his sheep from
[1:47:33] bears and
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:36] lions so you would sing David is a
[1:47:41] loser because his brothers are having
[1:47:44] better
[1:47:46] jobs his brothers are in the
[1:47:48] Army getting better salaries and living
[1:47:52] Better Lives
[1:47:53] but David was with the
[1:47:56] Sheep Bears and Lions coming a
[1:48:00] ship was very busy
[1:48:04] protecting little did anyone
[1:48:08] know including David
[1:48:10] himself that this
[1:48:13] suffering that he was in at the
[1:48:16] time was
[1:48:20] preparing for the throne
[1:48:25] amen I want to encourage you
[1:48:27] brother never Define your life by
[1:48:31] somebody
[1:48:35] else I'm a failure because so and so is
[1:48:38] ahead of
[1:48:40] me God has a plan for
[1:48:45] you as an
[1:48:48] individual it cannot be
[1:48:51] replaced no one can take your
[1:48:54] place stand in your
[1:48:57] place take care of your
[1:48:59] sheep take care of your little
[1:49:02] place Ser God Faithfully in your
[1:49:06] little believe God with all your heart
[1:49:08] in your little
[1:49:10] place whatever little God has given to
[1:49:14] you hold fast to it and do not look at
[1:49:19] others and feel they are better than you
[1:49:23] no one is better than
[1:49:26] me I am me because God wants
[1:49:30] to and is preparing
[1:49:32] me for me
[1:49:38] 2.0 praise
[1:49:41] God David was despised by his
[1:49:45] brother I want I want to read for you
[1:49:47] this
