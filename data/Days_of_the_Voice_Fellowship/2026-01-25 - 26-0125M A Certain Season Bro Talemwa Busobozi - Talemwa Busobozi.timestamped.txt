[1:02:34] as you lift him up,
[1:02:36] as you tell him, Lord, no matter what
[1:02:39] I've gone through in the past, I am here
[1:02:42] to tell you, Lord, take all the honor,
[1:02:45] take all the glory,
[1:02:48] take all the praise.
[1:02:50] You deserve it, Lord.
[1:02:53] No matter what a devil tries to do, take
[1:02:55] all the praise, Lord.
[1:02:58] I'm a believer and therefore I'm here to
[1:02:59] worship you, Lord. I'm here to glorify
[1:03:02] your holy name. The devil will take no
[1:03:05] glory.
[1:03:07] He will take no praise.
[1:03:10] Because it all belongs to you, Lord
[1:03:11] Jesus.
[1:03:14] I worship you with all my heart. I
[1:03:17] worship you, oh God, from the bottom of
[1:03:18] my heart today.

[1:04:46] Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] You
[1:05:01] loving Jesus,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; we have come to your house today.
[1:05:09] because we are grateful
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; when we see the battles you have taken
[1:05:16] us through
[1:05:20] that you have won for us
[1:05:23] each day of our life.
[1:05:25] We are here as a testimony
[1:05:30] that you are God
[1:05:32] and you are worthy to be praised.
[1:05:36] I want to give you all the glory Lord
[1:05:40] for what you have taken us through in
[1:05:41] the past year.
[1:05:46] And Lord, we have had sermons after
[1:05:49] sermons on this platform
[1:05:53] over the years.
[1:05:55] One year come and another year go.
[1:06:00] But you have remained faithful.
[1:06:04] Regardless of what we have gone through,
[1:06:06] Lord,
[1:06:08] you've not failed us. No forsaken us.
[1:06:12] Many a times, Lord, we failed you.
[1:06:15] We forsake you in our ways.
[1:06:18] But yet, you have remained faithful
[1:06:21] to the promise you've given to us.
[1:06:24] And Lord, we know we are your sons and
[1:06:26] you are your daughters.
[1:06:29] and you will not deny us but you will
[1:06:32] accept us in the glory
[1:06:34] and that's why we worship you and Lord
[1:06:37] as we have come once again to gather
[1:06:40] here Lord in your name
[1:06:43] I ask that Lord you will come and take
[1:06:46] control
[1:06:48] take control in each heart Lord
[1:06:51] maybe the hearts of those that are needy
[1:06:55] may they understand
[1:06:57] that this is the season of their
[1:07:00] breakthrough
[1:07:02] for Lord that you have allowed us to
[1:07:03] come in this place.
[1:07:06] We cannot walk out the way we can.
[1:07:09] Would you come Lord and take over the
[1:07:11] vessels
[1:07:13] for we are vessels of clay
[1:07:15] but use us Lord this morning and bless
[1:07:18] your people father once again. We commit
[1:07:22] every hearer, Lord,
[1:07:24] both here and elsewhere,
[1:07:27] everyone that is under sound of our
[1:07:29] voice this morning,
[1:07:31] come and overtake them, Lord.
[1:07:34] Overtake them, Lord. In Jesus name.
[1:07:38] Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. Good
[1:07:43] morning.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Tell your neighbor good
[1:07:46] morning.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; let us uh uh have a seat. We'll sing a
[1:07:55] little song
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; as we are going to have a brother come
[1:08:01] to dedicate to his brother
[1:08:08] come and dedicate their child.
[1:08:12] As they're coming, I want you to
[1:08:14] understand
[1:08:16] that this is a couple that have lost
[1:08:18] several children.
[1:08:21] We spoke about them in the youth camp,
[1:08:25] but you know, they have not ceased to
[1:08:27] worship God.
[1:08:30] They've not ceased
[1:08:33] to give themselves to the Lord.
[1:08:36] And regardless of what they went
[1:08:38] through,
[1:08:40] they kept on standing.
[1:08:42] They never looked back. And saints, I
[1:08:45] believe that's what it means to be a
[1:08:46] believer.
[1:08:49] Amen. And and so, you know, the
[1:08:52] brothers, the brother actually came with
[1:08:54] his wife
[1:08:56] at the camp. Can you please be still and
[1:08:59] know that I'm God? And you know, he came
[1:09:02] at the camp.
[1:09:04] And um you know, even when she was
[1:09:08] expecting just
[1:09:12] But I think that that was the best
[1:09:13] decision they made.
[1:09:16] And right there,
[1:09:18] you know, they were turned back because
[1:09:20] it was already very late.
[1:09:24] And that same night, my sister
[1:09:26] delivered.
[1:09:30] Amen. So really, this is one of the most
[1:09:33] precious baby that I have an opportunity
[1:09:36] to dedicate to.
[1:09:40] And let us sing this song as they come.
[1:09:43] Be still.
[1:09:49] Hallelujah.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I
[1:09:53] am God.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Sing it with me now. Be still
[1:10:00] and know
[1:10:03] that I
[1:10:07] am God.
[1:10:10] Be still.
[1:10:14] I know
[1:10:17] that I
[1:10:21] am God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; With every eye closed,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; they waited for a long time.
[1:10:27] through thick and thin. But the Lord
[1:10:30] never failed. Maybe one of you is
[1:10:32] waiting also.
[1:10:34] God will not fail. He will not forsake
[1:10:37] you for he promised you.
[1:10:41] I am
[1:10:44] the Lord
[1:10:47] that he
[1:10:53] waiting. Sing it by faith.
[1:10:58] The Lord
[1:11:01] that he
[1:11:04] live.
[1:11:13] Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; So sing it one more time. Be still and
[1:11:23] know. Anyone
[1:11:30] who is waiting,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just sing it.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to believe it.
[1:11:39] As brother
[1:11:41] Brian is having his child
[1:11:44] in his hands,
[1:11:46] so will you carry
[1:11:49] your fulfilled promise
[1:11:51] because the Lord never fails.
[1:11:54] Friends, there's quite a presence of the
[1:11:55] Holy Spirit here right now.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone better grabs that
[1:12:00] blessing.
[1:12:02] If you are waiting,
[1:12:05] be still and know that I am the Lord
[1:12:11] and I failed not.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and I fail not.
[1:12:23] Still I know
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; that I
[1:12:31] am God
[1:12:34] is still
[1:12:38] I know
[1:12:47] with every head bowed every eye
[1:12:52] for I am the Lord. Lord,
[1:12:54] I fail not.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; For this, even this
[1:13:00] shall be a sign to you.
[1:13:03] I am the Lord.
[1:13:06] I fail not.
[1:13:08] Wait upon me.
[1:13:10] I'll come even swiftly
[1:13:14] for I am the Lord
[1:13:17] and I fail not.
[1:13:21] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Let us sing one more time.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[1:13:35] I know.
[1:13:39] If you think you've waited for too long,
[1:13:43] I want you to know
[1:13:45] that God cannot fail you.
[1:13:49] Just quiet and down and wait upon him.
[1:13:54] Be anxious for nothing.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; He will not fail you. Whatever your
[1:14:00] desire is,
[1:14:02] whatever your need is,
[1:14:05] for I am the Lord
[1:14:08] and I will not fail
[1:14:11] with every eye and head bowed.
[1:14:15] Look at this child.
[1:14:28] I didn't even know what I was going to
[1:14:29] preach about today.
[1:14:32] I didn't even know what I was going to
[1:14:34] preach about
[1:14:36] until early this morning at 3:00 a.m.
[1:14:41] And this child is called Mercy.
[1:14:47] Lord Jesus,
[1:14:50] you are here Lord.
[1:14:53] As we hear the cry of this child,
[1:14:57] it symbolizes life.
[1:15:02] While her brother and his wife had
[1:15:05] several children, Lord,
[1:15:09] and there was no life,
[1:15:12] they could not hear the cry of a baby.
[1:15:15] But Lord this morning
[1:15:18] you are confirming your promise
[1:15:21] that you are God of mercy.
[1:15:25] Lord Jesus that you have given them this
[1:15:28] child
[1:15:29] and this cry of life
[1:15:32] shows.
[1:15:36] Your promise is accomplished.
[1:15:39] And father Lord we take this child
[1:15:47] and Lord we dedicate this child to you
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; back to you because you gave this child
[1:15:54] and we speak to the devil.
[1:15:57] You will not have this one.
[1:15:59] We surround his child
[1:16:02] with the blood of Jesus with the
[1:16:04] protection hand of Jehovah.
[1:16:07] Lord that you'll protect his child.
[1:16:10] Lord, you keep this child away from
[1:16:12] every spirit, away from every spell,
[1:16:16] away from every part of darkness, away
[1:16:18] from every spirit of death, away from
[1:16:20] every spirit of landia in the name of
[1:16:22] Jesus that this child shall be called
[1:16:25] blessed.
[1:16:26] And Lord, through this child, this
[1:16:29] family will always remember the mercy
[1:16:32] and the grace that you bestowed upon me
[1:16:35] and your grace and your faithfulness.
[1:16:37] Thank you, Lord. We pray oh God that the
[1:16:41] angel of the Lord will walk with this
[1:16:43] child from today and even forever more
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; as we dedicate this child now to you
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:55] Be my
[1:17:00] knowled
[1:17:09] Be still
[1:17:12] and
[1:17:16] th
[1:17:33] I am
[1:17:36] for I am
[1:17:39] the Lord
[1:17:43] that he better stand.
[1:17:48] Sing it from your heart now.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:17:57] that.
[1:18:02] Hallelujah.
[1:18:04] I am
[1:18:07] the Lord.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Saints, I'm going to speak to you this
[1:18:21] morning
[1:18:23] on a subject titled a certain season.
[1:18:30] I know that word certain can be taken
[1:18:33] for something, a season, a time like
[1:18:36] something.
[1:18:41] But also certain can also mean something
[1:18:43] that is sure,
[1:18:46] a sure season,
[1:18:49] a certain season.
[1:18:53] Whatever you you call it doesn't matter.
[1:18:55] You can say
[1:18:56] whatever
[1:18:58] That's what it's all about.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us read in the book of John
[1:19:02] chapter 5.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Brother promise just continue on a
[1:19:07] little bit. Musician just continue a
[1:19:08] little bit. I think we are done with the
[1:19:11] singing but just I want you to just
[1:19:12] continue playing those chords for just a
[1:19:14] moment. Just slowly please.
[1:19:18] First John chapter 5.
[1:19:21] Just John the Gospel 5 1.
[1:19:27] to 9.
[1:19:40] Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I was not I was going to speak on
[1:19:44] something completely different
[1:19:49] and I have never
[1:19:51] I mean I I couldn't sleep.
[1:19:56] The whole night I was up
[1:19:59] because I felt that God wanted me to
[1:20:01] speak about something else which I did
[1:20:02] not know.
[1:20:05] And then this came to me about 3:00 a.m.
[1:20:07] in the morning.
[1:20:10] The whole revelation just opened up
[1:20:14] and uh so uh it's just one of those that
[1:20:17] I feel that will perhaps be a blessing
[1:20:20] to someone.
[1:20:23] Not much teaching but just
[1:20:25] encouragement.
[1:20:29] John 5:1-9.
[1:20:35] After this,
[1:20:37] there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus
[1:20:40] went up to Jerusalem.
[1:20:42] Let us take it verse by verse.
[1:20:51] Now
[1:20:53] brother promise if you can go a little
[1:20:55] bit slower like reduce the sound. Now
[1:20:57] there is at there is at Jerusalem by the
[1:21:00] ship market a pool which is called in
[1:21:04] the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[1:21:08] portions.
[1:21:25] In these lay a great multitude of
[1:21:28] important folk of blind, hold, withered,
[1:21:34] waiting
[1:21:36] for the moving of the water.
[1:21:51] Everybody say waiting.
[1:21:55] Verses four. For an angel went down at a
[1:21:57] certain season
[1:21:59] at a certain season into the pool and
[1:22:02] troubled the water. Whosoever then first
[1:22:07] after the troubling of the water stepped
[1:22:09] in was made whole of whatsoever disease
[1:22:13] he had.
[1:22:28] a certain season. Now, let me read that
[1:22:32] again. He says, "For an angel went down
[1:22:34] at a certain season,
[1:22:42] not all the time.
[1:22:45] There was a certain season
[1:22:48] when the angel came down.
[1:22:51] a certain season.
[1:22:53] It was only a moment. It was a a small
[1:22:57] time that after the angel departed and
[1:23:00] the water was no longer trouble. If you
[1:23:03] did not step in, you missed your
[1:23:07] so
[1:23:13] and that's what we're talking about this
[1:23:14] morning.
[1:23:16] And a certain man was there which had an
[1:23:20] infirmity 30 and 8 years.
[1:23:32] When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[1:23:35] had been now a long time in that case,
[1:23:39] he saith unto him, "Wilt thou be made
[1:23:43] whole?
[1:23:56] Ask your neighbor, will thou be made
[1:23:58] whole?
[1:24:04] So this service
[1:24:06] is for those who have been waiting
[1:24:10] on something from the Lord.
[1:24:13] And I have good news for you. And I'm
[1:24:16] standing here boldly
[1:24:18] because I know I heard from the Lord.
[1:24:22] And I'm here to tell you,
[1:24:24] this is your season.
[1:24:28] Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] Praise God.
[1:24:35] The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I
[1:24:38] have no man when the water is troubled
[1:24:40] to put me into the pool. But while I'm
[1:24:42] coming, another step is done before me.
[1:24:58] Maybe it has happened to you for a long
[1:25:00] time.
[1:25:02] You feel like everybody around you is
[1:25:03] being blessed.
[1:25:07] But not you.
[1:25:09] But like brother Brian Brian, you will
[1:25:12] be able to say after this service,
[1:25:15] this is my season.
[1:25:20] Jesus said unto him,
[1:25:22] "Rise,
[1:25:24] take up thy bed, and walk."
[1:25:34] And immediately
[1:25:35] the man was made whole, and he took up
[1:25:38] his bed, and walked. And on the same day
[1:25:43] was the Sabbath,
[1:25:54] Sabbath means rest.
[1:25:57] Hallelujah. Today is the day of your
[1:26:02] now. I'm not speaking hypothetically.
[1:26:06] I'm speaking directly
[1:26:10] to you
[1:26:13] who God sent me to. This
[1:26:16] Please be seated. God bless you. May he
[1:26:19] bless the reading of his word.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; A certain season.
[1:26:33] I'd appreciate if we can stay put and
[1:26:36] not do a lot of movements
[1:26:41] so that we see you see what the Lord has
[1:26:44] for you this morning.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:51] There's always at right time
[1:26:55] for things to happen.
[1:26:59] I'm talking to you. a believer,
[1:27:02] there's always a right time
[1:27:06] for the the the things to happen.
[1:27:09] In the message, the hour has come.
[1:27:12] The prophet says, "Now, maybe you don't
[1:27:14] believe that."
[1:27:16] You say, "Well, my faith is weak.
[1:27:19] I wouldn't confess it."
[1:27:22] Don't let the devil know that.
[1:27:25] You don't let the devil hear your
[1:27:27] doubts.
[1:27:30] This is a new year. We are starting a
[1:27:33] new season.
[1:27:35] We are starting a new phase.
[1:27:38] Believe it or not, you are not the man
[1:27:40] that you were last year.
[1:27:45] You are now in another season.
[1:27:51] If you stay in your past,
[1:27:54] the season will pass.
[1:27:56] Something is happening now.
[1:27:59] This is a season that you have walked in
[1:28:03] and you are not here by accident.
[1:28:06] None of us is.
[1:28:08] You see, you are now yesterday you were
[1:28:11] a day younger.
[1:28:15] Now you are a day older
[1:28:18] and after this service you will be maybe
[1:28:21] two hours older.
[1:28:24] So seasons change and they change fast.
[1:28:28] Every time a clock moves,
[1:28:30] a season is shifting. A season is
[1:28:33] changing. So if you stay in your past,
[1:28:37] IF YOU STAY in the troubles of your
[1:28:38] yesterday
[1:28:40] and you still think about LIFE THAT WAY,
[1:28:43] you are failing to realize
[1:28:46] the season you have walked into.
[1:28:49] I am one person who believes that every
[1:28:52] moment of my life that passes,
[1:28:55] amen, something is happening in my life.
[1:28:59] And remember, I know who I am and have
[1:29:02] walked here as a son of God to fulfill
[1:29:05] everything that was written about me.
[1:29:08] THERE IS NOTHING IS HAPPENING BY
[1:29:10] MYSTERY.
[1:29:11] FOR ALL THINGS WORK together for good.
[1:29:15] Amen. To me who love the Lord. And I
[1:29:18] know I am called according TO HIS
[1:29:20] PURPOSE.
[1:29:22] SO THERE IS A SEASON. BAD THINGS HAPPEN
[1:29:24] IN MY LIFE. That was a season FOR THE
[1:29:27] BAD THINGS. GOOD THINGS HAPPENED. BUT
[1:29:30] YOU SEE THOSE WERE GOOD THINGS OF
[1:29:31] YESTERDAY. BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
[1:29:34] AGAIN that will will happen must HAPPEN
[1:29:39] because there HAS BEEN A CHANGE OF
[1:29:41] SEASONS.
[1:29:43] THE problem is many Christians, many
[1:29:45] believers don't discern the time, THE
[1:29:46] SEASON.
[1:29:51] WE ALWAYS LIVE IN THE PAST.
[1:29:54] YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT your
[1:29:55] brother and you you look at him
[1:29:57] according to the past.
[1:30:00] What they did to you, what they say to
[1:30:02] you and and you know, RELATIONSHIPS ARE
[1:30:05] SPOILED.
[1:30:06] YOU KNOW, CONNECTIONS ARE BROKEN
[1:30:09] BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE PAST.
[1:30:12] BUT YOU NEED TO START LIVING IN THE
[1:30:14] SEASON THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU IN.
[1:30:18] YOU KNOW THE THE CONDITION YOU HAVE BEEN
[1:30:20] SUFFERING FOR A LONG TIME,
[1:30:23] THE DESIRE, THE NEED YOU HAVE BEEN
[1:30:25] WANTING OR HAVING FOR A long time.
[1:30:29] There is a change of season HAPPENING
[1:30:30] RIGHT NOW.
[1:30:33] AMEN. I even HAVE A FEW TESTIMONIES
[1:30:36] RIGHT IN THE CHURCH. BROTHER BRIAN FOR
[1:30:38] ONE IS ONE TESTIMONY.
[1:30:41] How many years, brother?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS. BUT YOU SEE
[1:30:47] AFTER THE THIRD YEAR THE SEASON SHIFTED.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you ARE IN DEBT
[1:30:58] AND SOME of you don't even THINK ABOUT
[1:30:59] PAYING.
[1:31:01] Listen to an instruction. Praise the
[1:31:04] name of the Lord. Amen. Begin writing
[1:31:06] down all the debts that YOU HAVE BECAUSE
[1:31:09] SEASONS ARE going to shift.
[1:31:12] Amen. Amen. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN
[1:31:14] JOBLESS FOR SO LONG.
[1:31:17] AMEN. SO, I'M JUST HERE THIS MORNING TO
[1:31:20] PRONOUNCE A SHIFT, A CHANGE IN a season.
[1:31:25] So, you better Amen. OPEN YOUR MIND UP
[1:31:28] AND BEGIN TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[1:31:31] IF YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING IN THE REALM
[1:31:34] OF THE SPIRIT, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE
[1:31:36] IT. YOU WILL NOT ONLY HEAR A GOOD
[1:31:39] TEACHING OR GOOD PREACHING,
[1:31:42] BUT YOU WILL BEGIN TO ENVISION
[1:31:45] GOD has ever REVEALED ANYTHING TO YOU.
[1:31:48] AMEN. YOU SEE IT AS IF IT HAS HAPPENED.
[1:31:51] IF YOU'VE BEEN DESIRING A HOUSE,
[1:31:54] YOU WILL NOT BEGIN to dream OR TALK
[1:31:56] ABOUT IT.
[1:31:58] YOU BEGIN TO SEE IT. YOU BEGIN TO SEE
[1:32:00] WHERE YOUR BEDROOM IS. YOU BEGIN TO SEE
[1:32:03] HOW MANY ROOMS IT HAS. AMEN. YOU BEGIN
[1:32:05] TO ENVISION IT.
[1:32:08] AMEN. WHEN THE SEASON is right,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; praise the name of the Lord. So listen,
[1:32:13] he says, "When you say my faith is weak,
[1:32:16] I wouldn't confess it." And he said,
[1:32:19] "Don't let the devil KNOW THAT."
[1:32:22] HE didn't say IT IS NOT CORRECT.
[1:32:25] MAYBE YOUR FAITH IS WEAK, BUT DON'T LET
[1:32:27] THE DEVIL KNOW THAT.
[1:32:30] SOME OF YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY
[1:32:31] YOU'VE BEEN TALKING.
[1:32:34] WILL I EVER GET MARRIED? WILL THINGS
[1:32:36] HAPPEN IN MY LIFE? CAN I EVER HAVE A
[1:32:39] CHILD? CAN I EVER HAVE A HUSBAND? CAN I
[1:32:42] EVER HAVE A HOUSE? CAN I HAVE A BETTER
[1:32:44] JOB? YOU NEED TO BEGIN CHANGING THE WAY
[1:32:46] YOU ARE BEING TAUGHT.
[1:32:48] YOU KNOW WHY? DON'T LET THE DEVIL KNOW.
[1:32:52] YOUR weaknesses and YOUR DOUBTS.
[1:32:56] Always say, "I'VE GOT GOOD FAITH.
[1:33:00] I BELIEVE GOD WITH ALL MY HEART."
[1:33:03] DON'T TESTIFY NOTHING OF THE DEVIL.
[1:33:08] IT IS TRUE. THE DEVIL HAS DONE A LOT.
[1:33:11] BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT TODAY. LET'S
[1:33:13] NOT TESTIFY FOR THE DEVIL. WHEN THE
[1:33:16] DEVIL DOES SOMETHING BAD IN YOUR LIFE
[1:33:19] AND YOU TALK ABOUT IT, YOU ARE
[1:33:21] TESTIFYING FOR THE DEVIL.
[1:33:24] HELLO CHURCH. CAN WE TESTIFY FOR GOD?
[1:33:28] YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN BEFORE GOD DOES
[1:33:30] SOMETHING,
[1:33:32] AMEN. BY FAITH YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY. YOU
[1:33:35] BEGIN TO SEE THAT HE HAS DONE IT EVEN
[1:33:38] BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES.
[1:33:41] AND WHEN you accept him as YOUR HEALER,
[1:33:45] DON'T NEVER ACT LIKE YOU ARE SICK.
[1:33:48] DON'T NEVER ACT LIKE YOU ARE CRIPPLED
[1:33:49] ANYMORE.
[1:33:51] BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HEALED. BEFORE YOU
[1:33:54] ARE HEALED, BEGIN ACTING LIKE YOU ARE
[1:33:56] HEALED.
[1:33:58] BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR BREAKTHROUGH,
[1:34:00] BEGIN ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE IT.
[1:34:04] BEFORE YOU GET YOUR JOB, BEGIN ACTING
[1:34:06] LIKE YOU HAVE A JOB. DON'T WAIT TO GET A
[1:34:09] A JOB TO BEGIN PAYING LANDFER
[1:34:16] TO BEGIN HELPING TO BEGIN DOING THINGS.
[1:34:20] BEGIN TO DO THINGS. AMEN. AS THOUGH YOU
[1:34:23] HAVE A JOB.
[1:34:26] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; ACT LIKE YOU HAVE IT. ACT LIKE YOU SAVE.
[1:34:32] ACT LIKE YOU HAVE HEARD.
[1:34:34] AMEN. BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HEALED. TAKE
[1:34:37] HIM AT HIS WORD
[1:34:40] ALL OVER
[1:34:42] ON God and then not on you.
[1:34:48] As long as you take AS LONG AS YOU TAKE
[1:34:51] GOD AT HIS WORD,
[1:34:53] THEN THE WORD WILL PRODUCE
[1:34:59] WHAT IT PROMISED to do.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah. AMEN.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAYBE YOUR FAITH HAS BEEN DULL AND
[1:35:09] DO.
[1:35:13] Let's try to SHAKE IT UP THIS MORNING.
[1:35:15] AMEN. YOU'VE NOT SEEN AND THEREFORE
[1:35:19] YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING DOWN. BEGIN LOOKING
[1:35:21] UP BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID.
[1:35:25] THE PROMISES OF GOD ARE TRUE.
[1:35:28] AMEN. Now have faith. Believe him WITH
[1:35:32] ALL YOUR HEART.
[1:35:34] NOW JESUS here was speaking. HE SAID,
[1:35:36] "FATHER,
[1:35:38] THE TIME HAS COME.
[1:35:41] THE TIME HAS COME."
[1:35:44] IF JESUS WAS ME RIGHT NOW,
[1:35:47] RIGHT NOW, HE WOULD say the same thing.
[1:35:50] FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME.
[1:35:53] WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING FOR? THE TIME
[1:35:56] HAS COME. THE TIME HAS COME. LET ME TELL
[1:36:00] YOU, EVERY TIME I SPEAK AN INSPIRATION
[1:36:03] LIKE THIS,
[1:36:05] I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN MANY TIMES.
[1:36:08] I PREACHED THE GOSPEL FOR ABOUT 20
[1:36:09] YEARS.
[1:36:11] AND FRIENDS BELIEVE ME WHEN I GET AN
[1:36:13] INSPIRATION LIKE THIS I AM NOT JUST
[1:36:16] GIVING AN INSPIRATION OR OR RATHER a
[1:36:18] speak or speaking OR WHATEVER.
[1:36:22] IT'S A SEASON WHEN GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO
[1:36:25] DO SOMETHING
[1:36:28] FOR SOMEONE.
[1:36:30] MAYBE NOT EVERYONE BUT SOMEONE. SO THIS
[1:36:33] COULD BE FOR ONE PERSON. IT COULD BE FOR
[1:36:36] TWO OR THREE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, IF
[1:36:39] THEY RECEIVE IT, AMEN, IT WILL
[1:36:41] MATERIALIZE FOR THEM.
[1:36:45] HALLELUJAH. FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME.
[1:36:49] THE TIME HAS COME. HOW MANY REMEMBER THE
[1:36:52] PROMISES God gave them?
[1:36:55] You have a promise from God.
[1:36:58] IF YOU have a PROMISE FROM GOD, SAY
[1:37:00] AMEN.
[1:37:02] HE SAID, "FATHER, THE TIME HAS COME."
[1:37:05] WHICH MEANS THIS TIME WAS APPOINTED
[1:37:10] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:37:13] AMEN. A CHILD OF GOD DOES NOT WALK INTO
[1:37:16] AN AMBUSH.
[1:37:20] WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU,
[1:37:23] IT IS TIME FOR THAT.
[1:37:25] THAT'S WHY IN EVERYTHING WE MUST GIVE
[1:37:28] PRAISE. IN EVERYTHING WE MUST THANK GOD
[1:37:31] FOR ALL THINGS WE WORK TOGETHER FOR
[1:37:34] GOOD. AMEN. BUT TODAY IS NOT A TIME FOR
[1:37:39] BAD NEWS.
[1:37:40] TODAY I'M SAYING THE TIME HAS COME.
[1:37:44] AMEN. IS A SEASON FOR GOD TO FULFILL HIS
[1:37:47] PLAN.
[1:37:49] AMEN. AND there is a seasons for

[1:38:02] THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SEWING IN
[1:38:04] LAND FUN FOR A LONG TIME.

[1:38:25] AMEN. AMEN. YOU SOW IN A CERTAIN SEASON
[1:38:29] AND YOU REAP IN A CERTAIN SEASON.
[1:38:34] YOU'VE BELIEVED GOD FOR A LONG TIME FOR
[1:38:35] SOMETHING.
[1:38:38] THAT WAS A TIME OF SEWING. WHEN YOU
[1:38:40] BELIEVE GOD WITHOUT SEEING SOMETHING,
[1:38:43] THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE SOWING.
[1:38:46] AMEN. YOU ARE SOWING BY BELIEVING.
[1:38:49] AMEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN,
[1:38:52] BUT ALL YOU KNOW IS YOU BELIEVE HIS
[1:38:53] WORD.
[1:38:55] BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A SECOND SEASON
[1:38:58] TO REAP WHAT YOU HAVE SOWN.
[1:39:01] IF YOU SOW FAITH,
[1:39:04] YOU REAP SOMETHING. IF YOU SOW DOUBT,
[1:39:08] YOU REAP DOUBT. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, and
[1:39:11] you reap in a certain season.

[1:39:27] DON'T JUST HAPPEN.
[1:39:29] THEN THERE IS A SEASON WHEN THE TIME
[1:39:31] COME
[1:39:33] THAT'S RIGHT MEANING A RIGHT TIME FOR
[1:39:37] THE CERTAIN THINGS TO HAPPEN.
[1:39:40] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? AND THE TIME CAME
[1:39:43] ONE TIME FOR GOD TO DESTROY THE WORLD
[1:39:46] WITH WATER. AND HE SENT A MAN BY THE
[1:39:49] NAME OF NOAH AND GOT THE WORLD READY FOR
[1:39:52] JUDGMENT.
[1:39:53] AMEN. AND TIME CAME FOR NOAH TO GET INTO
[1:39:56] THE ARK. LOOK, NOAH COULD NOT GO INTO
[1:40:00] THE ARK
[1:40:02] BEFORE God was ready for him to go.
[1:40:06] BUT WHEN THE SEASON CAME, EVERYBODY SAY,
[1:40:09] WHEN THE SEASON CAME,

[1:40:18] GOD SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES
[1:40:23] FOR ANYONE ELSE TO EVER ENTER WAS GONE
[1:40:28] BECAUSE THAT GOD HAD CLOSED THE DOOR.
[1:40:32] AND THERE IS COMING A TIME WHEN GOD IS
[1:40:35] GOING TO CLOSE THE DOOR FOR EVERY ONE OF
[1:40:37] YOU. A MAN SUDDENLY CAN SIN AWAY AT HIS
[1:40:41] DAY OF GRACE.
[1:40:46] If this is the YOUR DAY OF GRACE,
[1:40:49] AMEN. AND YOU DON'T RECEIVE IT, WHAT IS
[1:40:52] SIN? SIN IS UNBELIEF.
[1:40:55] WHEN GOD IS SPEAKING AND YOU BEGIN
[1:40:57] DOUBTING, THAT SEASON WILL PASS. AND YOU
[1:41:01] CAN NEVER GET IT BACK.
[1:41:04] SO I'M ENCOURAGING YOU, CHURCH. DON'T
[1:41:06] SEE THAT IT'S ME TALKING. IT IS GOD
[1:41:09] SPEAKING TO YOU BECAUSE IT IS YOUR
[1:41:11] SEASON.
[1:41:13] HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:15] AMEN. DON'T SIN AWAY YOUR DAY OF GRACE.
[1:41:20] And this man was at the pool of
[1:41:21] Bethesda.
[1:41:23] Amen. First John, we read John 5:19.
[1:41:28] Look at THOSE THREE VERSES FIRST. After
[1:41:31] there was a feast of the of the Jews
[1:41:34] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now
[1:41:36] there at Jerusalem by the ship market a
[1:41:39] POOL
[1:41:42] which was called uh in the Hebrew tongue
[1:41:45] Bethesda.
[1:41:47] Now
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; what is Bethesda?
[1:41:50] Bethesda
[1:41:52] means
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; brother Brian Brian
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; it means house of mercy.
[1:42:05] House of mercy
[1:42:08] or flowing water.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive me for acting like a
[1:42:18] fanatic. Maybe I am.
[1:42:21] LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUR
[1:42:24] BETHESDA.
[1:42:27] BETHESDA IS A PLACE OF MERCY.
[1:42:31] WHEN YOU DON'T DESERVE SOMETHING, BUT
[1:42:33] BECAUSE IT'S THE TIME FOR GOD TO DO IT,
[1:42:36] GOD DOES IT.
[1:42:39] MANY TIMES WE THINK GOD WILL DO
[1:42:42] SOMETHING BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE
[1:42:44] SOMETHING. BUT CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
[1:42:47] TODAY? LET ME TELL YOU, GOD DOESN'T DO
[1:42:50] SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE
[1:42:52] ANYTHING. GOD DOES SOMETHING BECAUSE IT
[1:42:55] IS THE SEASON.
[1:42:58] AND WHEN THE SEASON HAS COME, NOTHING
[1:43:01] CAN HINDER IT. NOTHING CAN STOP THE
[1:43:04] MIRACLE. NOTHING CAN STOP GOD FROM
[1:43:07] MOVING AND DOING WHATEVER HE PROMISED IN
[1:43:10] HIS WORD. WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUR BASES.
[1:43:15] THE PLACE OF MERCY, THE PLACE OF FAVOR.
[1:43:21] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WOO.
[1:43:31] Let me tell you, I don't know where
[1:43:33] whether brother shame wants me to say
[1:43:34] this or not.
[1:43:36] I didn't even preach this because of
[1:43:38] that. I I wasn't even remembering. I
[1:43:40] just remembered it now.
[1:43:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This young man
[1:43:44] has served God for A LONG LONG TIME.
[1:43:47] NO JOB. Even now, no job. So, I'm not
[1:43:51] preaching it because he has got a job.
[1:43:54] But then some time back years ago, God
[1:43:58] shows him in a dream.
[1:44:00] I want to show YOU HOW GOD OPERATES.
[1:44:02] GOD shows him in a dream. He's going to
[1:44:04] the state house.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; He's going with investors,
[1:44:08] big investors.
[1:44:10] And he is working with them. If you're
[1:44:13] working with big people and you working
[1:44:14] with big people, you you cannot be a
[1:44:16] small person.
[1:44:20] Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] Praise God. And so long story short,
[1:44:26] right now, he's moving with his
[1:44:28] investment.
[1:44:32] Very soon, now be careful. Be careful
[1:44:35] what I say when I'm on the pulpit.
[1:44:38] Very soon, we will be making prayers
[1:44:42] like God touch this brother's heart
[1:44:45] to support this project of the church.
[1:44:50] If you have known what I'm talking
[1:44:52] about, you know what I'm saying.
[1:44:54] What am I saying? WHEN YOUR SEASON HAS
[1:44:57] COME. AMEN. SOMETIMES YOU WILL SEE GOD
[1:45:01] BLESSING THIS ONE, GOD BLESSING THAT
[1:45:02] ONE, GOD BLESSING THAT ONE, AND YOU
[1:45:04] FEEL, "OH, GOD, WHAT ABOUT ME?
[1:45:08] YOUR TIME OF CRYING
[1:45:11] IS COMING TO AN END. WHEN THE SEASON IS
[1:45:14] RIGHT,
[1:45:16] IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[1:45:19] SOMEBODY.
[1:45:21] IT'S ABOUT THE SEASON. SOMETIMES THINGS
[1:45:24] DELAY,
[1:45:26] NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE BAD, NOT BECAUSE
[1:45:28] YOU'RE BEING BEWITCHED, BUT BECAUSE THE
[1:45:31] SEASON IS NOT THERE YET.
[1:45:33] BUT WHEN THE SEASON HAS COME, YOU HAVE
[1:45:36] ARRIVED AS YOU HAVE
[1:45:40] THE PLACE OF MERCY
[1:45:43] WHERE IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT WHETHER YOU
[1:45:44] DO GOOD OR BAD,
[1:45:48] WHETHER YOU QUESTION OR NOT.
[1:45:50] IT IS A SEASON
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO BE BLESSED
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; AND IT CANNOT BE STOPPED.
[1:45:57] OH,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; NOW REMEMBER, BETHESDA IS FOR THOSE WHO
[1:46:03] HAVE WAITED
[1:46:06] faithfully waited.
[1:46:09] NOT THOSE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE
[1:46:10] WORLD AND DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT AND
[1:46:11] THEN THEY COME TO THE SEASON. NO,
[1:46:16] THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AT BETHESDA
[1:46:20] WAITING,
[1:46:21] WAITING AT THE RIGHT PLACE. WAITING AT
[1:46:26] THE RIGHT PLACE, BUT THINGS ARE NOT
[1:46:28] HAPPENING. UNTIL SOMETIMES THE DEVIL CAN
[1:46:31] MAKE YOU DOUBT
[1:46:34] WHAT YOU BELIEVE. MAYBE THE CHURCH, THE
[1:46:36] ONE THE CHURCH I'M GOING TO IS THE
[1:46:38] PROBLEM. MAYBE MY FAITH.
[1:46:42] MAYBE MY PASTOR IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE.
[1:46:44] MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE MY CHURCH. MAYBE I
[1:46:47] SHOULD CHANGE MY RELATIONSHIP. MAYBE I
[1:46:49] SHOULD CHANGE THAT. BUT ALL THROUGH
[1:46:51] THAT, YOU WAIT AT BETHESDA.
[1:46:55] NOW TO YOU WHO WAIT
[1:46:58] AT BETHESDA, YOUR FAITH UNMOVABLE.
[1:47:02] THINGS ARE HAPPENING. IT DOESN'T MAKE
[1:47:04] SENSE.
[1:47:06] BUT YOU WAIT AT BETHESDA. WHEN THE TIME
[1:47:10] HAS ARRIVED, NOTHING CAN STOP YOUR
[1:47:13] PLEASURE.
[1:47:19] The revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:47:24] says it and they sing the song of Moses.
[1:47:28] This is Revelation 53
[1:47:31] 53. And they sang the song of Moses, the
[1:47:35] servant of God, and the song of the
[1:47:37] lamb,
[1:47:38] saying, "Great and marvelous
[1:47:41] are thy works, Lord God Almighty.
[1:47:45] Just and true are thy ways.
[1:47:49] Thou king of saints." And brother Bam
[1:47:52] now asks us,
[1:47:54] just put up there quickly. Do you see
[1:47:56] it? The lamp. Everybody say the lamb.
[1:48:01] The high priest holding his blood as an
[1:48:03] atonement on the mercy
[1:48:09] of our sins is the Lord God Almighty.
[1:48:13] That is his present office.
[1:48:18] Present
[1:48:19] is the everpresent God.
[1:48:22] Amen. Banam said present in 1950 60
[1:48:26] whatever.
[1:48:28] is the same God. And I'm telling you,
[1:48:31] this is his present place.
[1:48:34] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Just
[1:48:38] hold it now. That is his present office.
[1:48:43] That that is what HE IS DOING NOW.
[1:48:46] Pleading his blood for our sins.
[1:48:51] BUT ONE DAY THAT LAMB WILL BECOME the
[1:48:54] lion of THE TRIBE OF JUDAH.
[1:48:57] HE WILL COME FORTH IN POWER and glory
[1:49:01] AND TAKE HIS AUTHORITY TO reign as king.
[1:49:05] He is the coming KING OF THIS EARTH.
[1:49:08] OF COURSE, THAT does not say he's not
[1:49:09] king. Now,
[1:49:11] for he is our king. He's the king OF THE
[1:49:14] SAINTS RIGHT NOW. It is a spiritual
[1:49:17] kingdom.
[1:49:19] It is not OF THIS WORLD SYSTEM. EVEN AS
[1:49:22] WE ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD, THAT'S THE
[1:49:24] REASON WE act different from the world.
[1:49:28] Our citizenship is in heaven.
[1:49:31] We reflect the spirit of the world uh of
[1:49:34] our rebirth where Jesus is the king.
[1:49:39] That's why our women dress the WAY THEY
[1:49:41] DRESS.
[1:49:43] THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THEY DON'T dress a
[1:49:45] mini skirt,
[1:49:47] mini dresses,
[1:49:49] SEETHROUGHS,
[1:49:54] EARRINGS. THAT'S WHY OUR BROTHERS DON'T
[1:49:56] DRESS THE CHUPAS.
[1:50:00] WHY THEY DON'T DRESS THOSE SHORTS AND
[1:50:03] THEY GO AROUND TOWN? WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE
[1:50:07] CITIZENS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY.
[1:50:09] THAT'S WHY WE BEHAVE THE WAY WE BEHAVE.
[1:50:12] NOT BECAUSE WE ARE UNDER RULES OR LAWS,
[1:50:15] BUT WE ARE CITIZENS OF ANOTHER LIFE.
[1:50:18] THAT'S WHY OUR WOMEN DO NOT DRESS IN
[1:50:20] MEN'S CLOTHING
[1:50:23] OR THEY DON'T CUT THEIR HAIR OR USE ALL
[1:50:26] THOSE COSMETICS AND THINGS
[1:50:29] THAT THE WORLD LIKES SO MUCH.
[1:50:33] AMEN SISTERS. THAT IS WHY OUR MEN DON'T
[1:50:37] DRINK AND SMOKE.
[1:50:39] AMEN. BROTHERS
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; AND CARRY ON IN SIN.
[1:50:44] AMEN. OUR DOMINION IS THE DOMINION OVER
[1:50:47] SIN
[1:50:49] AND IT IS IN FORCE THROUGH THE POWER
[1:50:52] THAT IS IN the spirit of GRACE
[1:50:57] that indwells us. You ought to SAY AMEN
[1:51:00] TO THAT. EVERY KINGDOM ON EARTH IS GOING
[1:51:05] TO BE torn down.
[1:51:08] AMEN. BUT OURS BUT OUR KINGDOM WILL
[1:51:13] REMAIN.
[1:51:15] HALLELUJAH. THEIR CIVILIZATION
[1:51:18] IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED. THEIR KINGDOMS
[1:51:22] ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED. YOU MAY BE A
[1:51:25] NEW. YOU MAY BE YOU MAY BE WHATEVER. YOU
[1:51:29] MAY BE PF. I DON'T CARE. THOSE KINGDOMS
[1:51:33] WILL ALL BE DESTROYED.
[1:51:36] BUT WE HAVE A KINGDOM.
[1:51:38] WE HAVE A KINGDOM AND THAT KINGDOM CAN
[1:51:42] NEVER BE DESTROYED. IT IS AN EVERLASTING
[1:51:45] KINGDOM.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH TO SAY AMEN. I BELIEVE
[1:51:57] my God.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Bethesa.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:03] Listen,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; I'll just read through it. Mark 9:17.
[1:52:11] And one of the multitude, one of the
[1:52:13] multitude answered and said, brother,
[1:52:18] let me just read through it.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Master, I have brought unto thee my son,
[1:52:23] which has a dump spirit, and whatsoever
[1:52:26] he take, he taketh him, he teareth him,
[1:52:28] and he formeth and nashth with his
[1:52:31] teeth, and pineth away. And I spake to
[1:52:33] thy disciples that they should cast him
[1:52:35] out, and they could not. You You're
[1:52:37] prepared to read it quickly, brother. He
[1:52:38] answerth him, and saith, Oh faith,
[1:52:42] faithless generation, how long shall I
[1:52:44] be with you? How long shall I suffer
[1:52:46] you? Bring him unto me. And they brought
[1:52:47] him unto him. And when he saw him,
[1:52:50] straight away the spirit tear him, and
[1:52:52] he fell on the ground, and wallowed
[1:52:54] forming, and he answered his father. He
[1:52:57] asked his father, "How long is is it a
[1:52:59] go since this came unto him?" And he
[1:53:02] said, "Of a child, and often times it
[1:53:05] has cast him into the fire and into the
[1:53:07] waters to destroy him. And if thou canst
[1:53:09] do anything, have compassion on us and
[1:53:14] help us." This is what the parent was
[1:53:16] telling the the father of the child uh
[1:53:19] the was telling Jesus rather. Jesus said
[1:53:21] unto him, "If thou canst believe, all
[1:53:23] things are possible to him that
[1:53:26] believeth." And straight away the father
[1:53:28] of the child cried out and said WITH
[1:53:30] TEARS, LORD, I BELIEVE. Help thou my
[1:53:32] unbelief. When Jesus saw that the people
[1:53:35] came running together, he rebuked the
[1:53:37] foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dump
[1:53:40] and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out
[1:53:42] of him, and enter no more into him. And
[1:53:46] the spirit cried and ren him so and came
[1:53:49] out of him and he was one as one dead in
[1:53:52] so much that many said he's he's dead
[1:53:55] but Jesus took him by the hand and
[1:53:56] lifted him up and he arose. Can you read
[1:53:59] that brother?
[1:54:23] May God anoint you to read it well and
[1:54:25] read it fast.
[1:54:47] Number
[1:54:52] one.
[1:55:16] Amen.
[1:55:37] Listen
[1:55:57] verse 22. Now often times it has cast
[1:56:00] him into the fire and into the waters to
[1:56:02] destroy him. But if thou canst do
[1:56:04] anything, have compassion on us and help
[1:56:06] us.
[1:56:14] Listen,
[1:56:17] what is compassion?
[1:56:19] You know the way the father described
[1:56:21] how this demon was tormenting his CHILD
[1:56:27] and then he ends it with saying if you
[1:56:30] can please have compassion.
[1:56:35] God does not do things for you because
[1:56:37] he feels bad about what you're going
[1:56:38] through.
[1:56:45] He has suffered a lot. Let me help you.
[1:56:47] He has suffered a lot
[1:56:49] because of that. Let me do something.
[1:56:53] Brother Brian suffered very much.
[1:56:56] Let me help you. Oh, you mean that he
[1:56:59] was waiting for you to suffer too much
[1:57:02] so he can do something for you? That's
[1:57:04] not compassion. God is compassion.
[1:57:08] But the Bible says his compassion for
[1:57:10] you now.
[1:57:13] HE ALWAYS HAS COMPASSION.
[1:57:15] BUT YOU SEE HIS COMPASSION
[1:57:18] THEY FAIL NOT
[1:57:20] WHICH MEANS WHEN GOD HAS COMPASSION ON
[1:57:23] YOU
[1:57:26] CAN'T FAIL TO TAKE YOU OUT OF YOUR
[1:57:28] SITUATION. BUT NOW LISTEN. WHAT KIND OF
[1:57:32] COMPASSION?
[1:57:33] AFTER THIS MAN EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
[1:57:37] ACTUALLY WHILE HE WAS TALKING, THE CHILD
[1:57:39] WAS SMITTEN AND HE BEGAN FORMING
[1:57:45] and biting his tongue, you know, like
[1:57:48] how those things, you know, HOW THEY
[1:57:49] BEHAVE.
[1:57:51] And and WHEN JESUS SAW THAT, HE WASN'T
[1:57:54] MOVED. HE KNEW.
[1:57:57] HE KNEW BEFORE THAT CHILD WAS BORN THAT
[1:58:01] THAT CHILD WAS SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH
[1:58:02] THAT. SO, DID GOD HAVE COMPASSION OR
[1:58:05] NOT?
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; YES. HIS COMPASSION FAIL.
[1:58:11] BUT WHY DID HE LET IT HAPPEN?
[1:58:13] HE LET IT HAPPEN BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE
[1:58:17] WOULD BE A CERTAIN SEASON
[1:58:22] WHERE HE,
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; THE MASTER OF THE WIND,
[1:58:27] THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH,
[1:58:30] THE ONE THAT STEALS THE STORM
[1:58:33] THAT WOULD COME ON THE SCENE.
[1:58:37] THAT NOW MY FRIEND WOULD BE A CERTAIN
[1:58:40] SEASON.
[1:58:43] AMEN. A SEASON WHERE GOD WOULD HAVE TO
[1:58:47] HEAL THIS BOY.
[1:58:50] YOU KNOW THE FATHER BEGAN EXPLAINING THE
[1:58:53] FATHER WAS JUST WASTING HIS TIME.
[1:58:55] WHETHER HE EXPLAINED OR NOT
[1:58:58] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS BEFORE WE PRAY
[1:59:02] HE KNOWS WHAT WE HAVE MADE ON BEFORE WE
[1:59:05] PRAY. SO WHY DO WE PRAY SOMETIMES AND
[1:59:09] THINGS WE HAVE PRAYED FOR WE DON'T
[1:59:11] RECEIVE ANSWERS.
[1:59:14] WE THINK WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANSWERS
[1:59:16] BUT HE PROMISING HIS WORD THAT WHEN WE
[1:59:19] PRAY HE WILL ANSWER. SO WHY DON'T WE
[1:59:22] APPARENTLY THINK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED
[1:59:24] ANSWERS.
[1:59:26] The season is not yet. HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:32] WHAT ARE HIS COMPASSIONS?
[1:59:34] THE COMPASSION OF GOD IS THE will of
[1:59:36] God. HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:45] THE MAN SAID, "I BELIEVE HELP MY
[1:59:47] ARMIES." SO, DID HE BELIEVE OR NOT?
[1:59:52] HE DID HAVE FAITH,
[1:59:54] BUT IT WAS THE SEASON FOR GOD TO MOVE ON
[1:59:57] THE SCENE AND HE HEALED HIS CHILD. AND
[2:00:00] THAT'S WHY JESUS TOOK HIM BY THE HANDS
[2:00:04] and he lifted him and he arose after
[2:00:08] casting out THAT SPIRIT
[2:00:12] is the same Jesus today.
[2:00:15] The difference is
[2:00:17] in two feet.
[2:00:24] He's in two feet.
[2:00:27] He's
[2:00:29] in you and me.
[2:00:34] So when the season is right,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; that spirit cannot stay in there.
[2:00:42] That demon cannot STAY IN THERE.
[2:00:45] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:46] But the problem with us, WE GIVE UP TOO
[2:00:50] SOON.
[2:00:51] WE GIVE UP TOO FAST.
[2:00:54] MAYBE MY CHURCH IS THE PROBLEM.
[2:00:56] MAYBE THIS PASTOR is not anointed.
[2:00:59] Maybe maybe these people are the
[2:01:02] problem.
[2:01:03] Maybe the church is the problem because
[2:01:06] it's not looking so beautiful.
[2:01:09] Maybe that, MAYBE THIS. MY FRIEND,
[2:01:11] LISTEN. IF YOU ARE STANDING IN THE WORD,
[2:01:15] EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT.
[2:01:20] WHEN YOU PRAY FOR SOMETHING AND IT
[2:01:22] DOESN'T HAPPEN,
[2:01:24] IT'S NOT BECAUSE GOD HAS NOT ANSWERED
[2:01:26] YOU, FRIEND.
[2:01:28] IT IS BECAUSE THE SEASON IS NOT YET.
[2:01:33] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE SEASON IS RIGHT,
[2:01:36] HIS compassions fail.
[2:01:41] Let me prove that to you.
[2:01:44] I just want you to get into this with me
[2:01:48] and then you will see what will happen
[2:01:49] to you.
[2:01:52] In 1965,
[2:01:54] brother Bannam preached a sermon and he
[2:01:57] titled it this day
[2:02:00] this scripture
[2:02:02] is fulfilled.
[2:02:04] And listen to what he said. He went into
[2:02:07] the temple.
[2:02:09] We called him a meek man.
[2:02:12] He was but many times we misunderstand
[2:02:16] what meekness is.
[2:02:19] He was A MAN OF COMPASSION
[2:02:22] BUT YET we fail to sometimes to
[2:02:25] understand what compassion is.
[2:02:30] HE SAYS COMPASSION
[2:02:33] is not human sympathy.
[2:02:42] BUT COMPASSION
[2:02:45] IS DOING THE WILL OF GOD.
[2:02:48] HALLELUJAH. HE PASSED THROUGH THE POOL
[2:02:51] OF BETHESDA.
[2:02:55] THERE ARE LAID PEOPLE.
[2:02:57] MULTITUDES OF
[2:02:59] MULTITUDES IS NO CERTAIN NUMBER.
[2:03:04] THE LAME, the blind, THE WHOLE, THE
[2:03:08] WITHERED.
[2:03:10] AND HE HAD COMPASSION ON THE PEOPLE
[2:03:12] ALWAYS.
[2:03:16] And he went to one PERSON
[2:03:20] that was not lame,
[2:03:24] blind, not whole, NOT WITHERED.
[2:03:28] MAYBE HE HAD A PROSTATE TROUBLE.
[2:03:32] MAYBE HE HAD SOME LITTLE INFIRMITY THAT
[2:03:34] WAS
[2:03:38] He had had it for 38 years.
[2:03:42] IT WAS NOT GOING TO BOTHER HIM.
[2:03:47] IT WAS NOT GOING TO KILL HIM.
[2:03:49] HE WAS LYING ON A PALLET FOR 38 YEARS.
[2:03:56] SO HE WASN'T A A VERY EMERGENCY CASE.
[2:04:03] YOU COULD LIVE WITH IT.
[2:04:06] BUT WHEN HE THE MASTER CAME,
[2:04:10] HE PASSED
[2:04:12] THE LENGTH, THE HO, THE WITHERED, AND HE
[2:04:17] PASSED ALL OF THEM.
[2:04:19] YET HE HAD COMPASSION
[2:04:22] FOR ALL OF THEM. ANSWER ME, MY SISTER.
[2:04:26] WHY DIDN'T HE HEAL ALL OF THEM?
[2:04:30] YET IS A A A MAN OF COMPASSION
[2:04:34] BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR SEASON.
[2:04:42] IT WAS NOT THEIR TIME.
[2:04:45] IT WAS NOT THE WILL OF GOD
[2:04:47] FOR HIM TO HEAL THEM. HE HAD COME FOR
[2:04:52] ONE MAN LYING ON A PALACE.
[2:04:56] HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:58] IT WAS A SEASONAL, A CERTAIN SEASON FOR
[2:05:03] THIS MAN.
[2:05:05] HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; And he said wilt thou be made home.
[2:05:11] And the man said, I have nobody to put
[2:05:15] in the water. Put him in the water. But
[2:05:18] while I'm coming
[2:05:20] where someone steps down ahead of SO YOU
[2:05:22] COULD WALK, HE COULD SEE. He could get
[2:05:26] around,
[2:05:29] but he was feeble.
[2:05:32] Maybe that is you.
[2:05:36] It's not that you, no one may even know
[2:05:38] what you're going through.
[2:05:41] But when you are suffering,
[2:05:44] going through something for many years,
[2:05:48] you're just fe
[2:05:52] and you have owned it. me gave up. No
[2:05:55] one can hear.
[2:05:58] I have news for you today.
[2:06:01] The season is right.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I HAVE COME TO ANNOUNCE A SEASON FOR
[2:06:07] SOMEONE HERE TODAY.
[2:06:12] AMEN. JESUS SAID,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; "RISE UP, TAKE UP YOUR BED AND GO TO
[2:06:19] YOUR HOUSE." AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING TO
[2:06:22] YOU, WHATEVER YOU ARE GOING THROUGH.
[2:06:25] WHATEVER PROBLEM YOU HAVE HAD FOR YEARS,
[2:06:28] RISE UP. TAKE YOUR BED. GO TO YOUR
[2:06:31] HEART.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; YOUR PROBLEM IS OVER.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR SEASON.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR SEASON. IT IS YOUR SEASON.
[2:06:41] HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE LEFT THE LAME, THE BLIND, THE
[2:06:48] HALT, THE WITHERED.
[2:06:50] HE
[2:06:52] HE WENT TO THE ONE THAT WAS NOT LAME.
[2:06:56] HE WAS NOT BLIND. HE WAS NOT HOLD. HE
[2:06:59] WAS NOT WITHERED. THIS MAN FOR 38 YEARS
[2:07:04] WAS WAITING,
[2:07:06] WAITING FOR his s.
[2:07:11] THIS WOULD BE GOD'S SEASON.
[2:07:14] GOD'S WILL FOR THIS MAN IS DELIVERANCE.
[2:07:25] HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:27] Waiting is not nice. WAITING IS PAINFUL.
[2:07:33] WAITING IS BORING. WAITING FEELS LIKE
[2:07:37] CHAOS. WAITING IS FRUSTRATING.
[2:07:43] THERE IS NO ONE IN THE SCRIPTURE,
[2:07:47] A CHILD OF GOD THAT GOD MADE WAY
[2:07:53] FOR NOTHING.
[2:07:56] AMEN. I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU, MY
[2:07:58] BROTHER.
[2:08:00] HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD REASON
[2:08:05] TO MAKE YOU WAIT.
[2:08:07] GOD HAS A GOOD REASON FOR YOU TO WAIT.
[2:08:10] ABRAHAM AND SARAH THEY WAITED 25 YEARS
[2:08:16] AND then came forth.
[2:08:19] HANNAH WAITED ABOUT 19 YEARS AND THEN
[2:08:24] came forth.
[2:08:26] MANOA'S WIFE WAITED
[2:08:29] OVER 20 YEARS AND BROUGHT FORTH SAMSON.
[2:08:34] ELIZABETH WAITED
[2:08:36] MANY MANY YEARS AND BROUGHT FORTH JOHN
[2:08:39] THE BAPTIST.
[2:08:40] REBECCA WAITED 20 YEARS AND BROUGHT
[2:08:44] FORTH ISRAEL. IF YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING,
[2:08:47] YOU ARE IN GOOD COMPANY TODAY.
[2:08:51] AMEN.
[2:08:56] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO
[2:08:58] BE. YOU ARE IN BAPTIST.
[2:09:02] A PLACE OF MERCY.
[2:09:04] A PLACE OF MERCY.
[2:09:07] WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, WHEN THE SEASON
[2:09:09] IS RIGHT, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN FOR YOU.
[2:09:13] THE WAY IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH
[2:09:15] OTHERS,
[2:09:17] IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH YOU. THE WAY IT
[2:09:20] HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR OTHERS,
[2:09:23] THE OTHERS HAD TO WAIT FOR AN ANGEL TO
[2:09:26] COME AND START THE WATERS. BUT THIS ONE,
[2:09:30] AMEN. THIS ONE, THE MASTER HIMSELF,
[2:09:34] HE CAME DOWN. HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; BROTHER AMRA, I'VE JUST SEEN YOU. THIS
[2:09:42] IS YOUR SEASON.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; I HAVE HEARD YOUR TESTIMONY. WHAT IS IT?
[2:09:47] DON'T DOUBT IT A BIT.
[2:09:50] THIS YOUNG MAN WENT TO KALI FOR
[2:09:54] OPERATION. THEY ALMOST GAVE HIM BAD
[2:09:56] NEWS, BUT HIS EYES COULD NOT SEE
[2:10:01] ANYMORE. THEY WERE GOING DOWN AND DOWN
[2:10:04] AND DOWN AND DOWN.
[2:10:08] AND HE WAS LOSING HOPE
[2:10:11] AND AND THEY APPOINTED HIM TO GO FOR
[2:10:15] OPERATION. HE WENT BACK AND THEY TOLD
[2:10:18] HIM YOU KNOW WHAT it is worse.
[2:10:23] So you have to go come back again for
[2:10:26] review. So he came he was almost GOING
[2:10:30] INTO A DEPRESSION
[2:10:32] AND YOU KNOW AROUND THE YOUTH TIME OF
[2:10:34] THE YOUTH CAMP ON THE FLOOR
[2:10:36] HE WENT BACK AND THEY REVIEWED HIM AGAIN
[2:10:39] AND WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM
[2:10:43] ACTUALLY THIS EYE IS SEEING MUCH BETTER
[2:10:46] THAN the one which we operated.
[2:10:51] Say you don't NEED AN OPERATION.
[2:10:54] DON'T TELL ME. DON'T TELL ME OUR GOD IS
[2:10:58] NO.
[2:10:59] OUR GOD IS A HEALER. BUT SOMETIMES HE
[2:11:03] MAKES US WAIT.
[2:11:05] BECAUSE IT'S WAITING FOR THE SEASON.
[2:11:08] AMEN. YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO REMAIN AT PROPHETIC.
[2:11:14] COME TO CHURCH. KEEP THE FAITH. LISTEN
[2:11:17] TO THE WORD. GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY. EVEN
[2:11:20] WHEN YOU SEE NOTHING, EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL
[2:11:23] NOTHING, EVEN WHEN YOU TEST NOTHING.
[2:11:26] HALLELUJAH. EVEN WHEN YOU HEAR NOTHING,
[2:11:29] I AM HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[2:11:32] BETHESDA IS THE PLACE OF YOUR MERCY.
[2:11:38] AMEN.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; THIS MAN WAITED FOR 38 YEARS.
[2:11:44] BUT THIS was not without a purpose.
[2:11:48] Amen. THE MAN STARTED LYING
[2:11:50] ON A PALLET. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE
[2:11:53] HISTORY
[2:11:56] SO YOU CAN SEE
[2:11:58] OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE.
[2:12:01] THE MAN was lying ON THIS PALACE
[2:12:04] FOR almost seven years
[2:12:07] before Jesus was born.
[2:12:12] Think about it.
[2:12:15] Prophecy,
[2:12:16] however,
[2:12:19] about Jesus's birth
[2:12:22] was given
[2:12:24] LONG
[2:12:26] BEFORE THIS man was actually born.
[2:12:33] Your problem
[2:12:35] looks like it HAS STAYED
[2:12:37] FOR SO long
[2:12:40] that Jesus is nonexistent.
[2:12:44] The devil would even dare ask you
[2:12:47] where is your God?
[2:12:50] For seven years the devil asked this man
[2:12:54] where is your God?
[2:12:56] Jesus was not yet born.
[2:13:00] But remember
[2:13:02] with God his thought is as good as his
[2:13:07] action.
[2:13:12] For seven years, the man was on the path
[2:13:16] and Jesus was not even born.
[2:13:19] But God had already
[2:13:23] thought about this man solution
[2:13:28] before this man was actually born.
[2:13:33] The prophecy had been given.
[2:13:36] Isaiah 61. The spirit of the Lord is
[2:13:39] upon me because the Lord has anointed me
[2:13:42] to preach about titles and the meek. He
[2:13:46] has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
[2:13:49] to proclaim liberty to the captives and
[2:13:51] the opening of the prison to them that
[2:13:52] are bound to proclaim the acceptable
[2:13:55] year of the Lord and the of our God to
[2:13:59] comfort all that mourn.
[2:14:02] THIS MAN WAS A CAPTIVE.
[2:14:06] HE WAS brokenhearted
[2:14:10] but he was meek
[2:14:13] ONLY WAITING
[2:14:16] FOR THE second season
[2:14:19] of his healing. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL
[2:14:22] DID
[2:14:23] WHEN THE SEASON COME,
[2:14:26] NO ONE COULD hinder this man's
[2:14:31] and then Jesus came.
[2:14:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:37] And then Jesus came.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:42] YEARS LATER
[2:14:45] and he takes this book.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; He goes into the thoughts of God
[2:14:53] and he reads it to who do you think
[2:14:58] he was reading it to the death?
[2:15:02] He was testifying
[2:15:05] of his ministry, who he was.
[2:15:09] And he said, "The spirit of the Lord God
[2:15:12] is upon me
[2:15:15] because the Lord has ANOINTED ME
[2:15:18] TO PREACH GOOD TIDINGS
[2:15:21] unto the meek."
[2:15:23] Notice this was in first person pronoun.
[2:15:30] This is HOW THE PROPHECY WAS GIVEN.
[2:15:33] ISAIAH WAS GIVING THE PROPHECY,
[2:15:36] not telling us what it WAS MEANING,
[2:15:39] BUT JESUS READS IT. AND WHENEVER IT
[2:15:42] REACHES on me,
[2:15:45] HE EMPHASIZES IT. THE PHARISEES ARE
[2:15:48] LOOKING AT HIM. THE SADDUCEES ARE
[2:15:51] LOOKING AT HIM. AND HE READS, "THE
[2:15:54] SPIRIT OF THE LORD GOD
[2:15:56] IS upon
[2:15:58] me."
[2:16:01] BECAUSE THE LORD HAS ANOINTED ME
[2:16:05] to preach the GOOD TO THE MEEK.
[2:16:08] HE HAS SENT ME TO BIND UP THE BROKEN
[2:16:12] HEART TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE
[2:16:14] CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON
[2:16:16] TO THOSE THAT ARE
[2:16:19] TO PROCLAIM THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE
[2:16:23] LORD.
[2:16:25] HE CLOSED THE BOOK. EVERYBODY LOOKED AT
[2:16:28] HIM. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? WHO ARE
[2:16:32] YOU? AND THEN HE BEGAN TO SAY THESE
[2:16:34] WORDS.
[2:16:36] THIS DAY, THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE
[2:16:41] FULFILLED
[2:16:43] IN YOUR EARS. MEANING EVERYTHING YOU
[2:16:46] HAVE HEARD ME SAY.
[2:16:50] HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE TO COME.
[2:16:54] HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; I AM THE ONE.
[2:16:59] AMEN. I'M HERE. I HAVE ARRIVED. IT IS MY
[2:17:03] TIME. IT IS MY SEASON
[2:17:06] TO COME AND HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED,
[2:17:09] TO TAKE THOSE WHO ARE IN PRISON AND SET
[2:17:11] THEM FREE. I AM HERE TO HEAL THE
[2:17:15] BROKENHEARTED,
[2:17:17] TO LOSE those who are bound.
[2:17:20] ALL HELL
[2:17:22] had to give way
[2:17:25] for the season.
[2:17:27] Pray pray
[2:17:31] and this man was there for so long and
[2:17:34] the devil begins to tempt you.
[2:17:37] Is your God alive?
[2:17:40] You think your God exists?
[2:17:43] Is even the message true?
[2:17:47] If it was true
[2:17:50] when that man of God prayed for you,
[2:17:53] why didn't things change?
[2:17:56] Let us be realistic
[2:17:59] when you went at the altar
[2:18:01] and I prayed for you. Didn't you even
[2:18:04] fall down?
[2:18:06] Did you feel the anointing? You did.
[2:18:09] What happened?
[2:18:12] Tell me what happened.
[2:18:15] Leave those ones. They don't have the
[2:18:17] power.
[2:18:20] That's why you still have your problem.
[2:18:26] And then it begins to weigh on you.
[2:18:30] I think it is true.
[2:18:33] This brother,
[2:18:35] God sent him a prophet from Nigeria.
[2:18:38] Nigeria. He told him, "Live those ones.
[2:18:44] Just come. You are even anointed that I
[2:18:47] don't know.
[2:18:49] I'll make you my associate pastor.
[2:18:52] I'll give you money.
[2:18:55] You I will improve your life.
[2:19:01] But the brother
[2:19:03] said, "No,
[2:19:08] what are you going to do
[2:19:10] when a devil comes at you like that?
[2:19:31] TO THIS MAN
[2:19:33] REGARDLESS OF HIS CONDITION
[2:19:37] WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION.
[2:19:42] WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION,
[2:19:45] THIS IS OUR SEASON.
[2:19:48] HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR SEASON.
[2:19:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Would thou be made whole?
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; He asked the same thing today.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Would you be made whole?
[2:20:05] Stop the excuses.
[2:20:07] The man was like, "Ah, I have no one to
[2:20:09] help me. The water is troubled. No one
[2:20:12] to put me in.
[2:20:14] I can no one I have no connection."
[2:20:18] YOU DON'T NEED CONNECTIONS.
[2:20:20] STOP THE EXCUSES.
[2:20:22] TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS. LOVE THEM. TELL
[2:20:23] THEM STOP THE EXCUSES.
[2:20:28] AMEN. Listen to WHAT GOD IS TELLING YOU.
[2:20:32] TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK.
[2:20:36] HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? EVERYTHING IS
[2:20:39] INSIDE THERE. It means let your feet
[2:20:42] walk. Let your mind be restored.
[2:20:46] It means amen. Receive your job. It
[2:20:50] means RECEIVE YOUR WIFE, RECEIVE YOUR
[2:20:53] YOUR HUSBAND. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. TAKE
[2:20:55] UP YOUR BED AND WALK.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. IT
[2:21:02] MEANS YOUR DEBTS WILL BE PAID.
[2:21:06] HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; AM I PREACHING TO SOMEONE HERE? MAYBE
[2:21:10] YOU HAVE BEEN OVEREN WITH DEBTS
[2:21:14] LIKE THAT WIDOW WOMAN. BUT THERE COMES A
[2:21:17] TIME WHEN THE DEVIL CANNOT STOP THE
[2:21:21] ANGEL FROM MOVING AND WHEN THE SEASON
[2:21:24] WAS RIGHT, AMEN. AND THE PROPHET HAD
[2:21:27] ARRIVED, THERE WAS NO DEVIL THAT COULD
[2:21:30] STOP THAT MIRACLE FROM HAPPENING.
[2:21:35] LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[2:21:37] OUR PROPHET HAS ALREADY COME. WE ARE
[2:21:40] UNDER THE MINISTRY OF ELIJAH.
[2:21:43] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE ARE IN OUR
[2:21:45] SEASON OF RESTORATION.
[2:21:49] AM I PREACHING TO YOU, SISTER? WE ARE IN
[2:21:52] OUR SEASON.
[2:21:57] LET'S GET IT TODAY.
[2:22:00] HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHOUTING. I
[2:22:04] AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXCITEMENT. I AM
[2:22:06] TALKING ABOUT A PERSONAL REVELATION.
[2:22:10] WHEN YOU GET IT, YOU ARE GOING TO WALK
[2:22:12] OUT OF HERE.
[2:22:15] AND SOMETHING WILL BEGIN to materialize.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I SAID HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; My wife has a gift of visions.
[2:22:41] And so me, I did not know. You know,
[2:22:42] sometimes we see women pregnant, we
[2:22:43] don't know how long.
[2:22:48] And so
[2:22:50] I said when I first heard or learned
[2:22:54] that brother Brian's wife was expecting
[2:22:57] I said my wife, isn't that too fast?
[2:23:02] Is it two months?
[2:23:04] She said, "No, I talked to her." No,
[2:23:06] women talk.
[2:23:09] It's about SEVEN OR EIGHT.
[2:23:11] OH, IT'S almost you. And I knew this is
[2:23:15] around the time
[2:23:18] that the devil was always coming.
[2:23:24] And then do you know when I knew it is
[2:23:26] done, brother Brian
[2:23:29] is when she told me
[2:23:32] that your wife is going to have a God.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; You remember that I told you?
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:41] And had you checked? Did you know
[2:23:44] at that time you had checked? Did you
[2:23:48] talk to us?
[2:23:49] But God had already known.
[2:23:53] And then when we TOLD HIM, "YEAH, IF
[2:23:54] YOU'RE HAVING A BABY."
[2:23:57] So I knew this one the devil will not
[2:24:00] take is the season.
[2:24:04] Hallelujah.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you this is our season
[2:24:12] as the bride of Christ.
[2:24:15] Brother Bham saw the vision
[2:24:18] the PREVIEW
[2:24:24] and I believe I was in that.
[2:24:28] I cannot die. The devil cannot have me
[2:24:31] before my time.
[2:24:35] Now
[2:24:39] I want to try and bring you to a climax.
[2:24:42] Be prepared now.
[2:24:45] This is our time
[2:24:47] our season. Isaiah 61
[2:24:51] three to appoint unto them that mourn in
[2:24:55] Zion.
[2:24:59] Get it? Get it? Get it? Isaiah 61:3.
[2:25:03] This is what happens in our time.
[2:25:08] Amen. If you've been mourning,
[2:25:11] your time of morning is over.
[2:25:16] Hallelujah.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Receive these declarations as a word of
[2:25:19] God for your life individually,
[2:25:21] PERSONALLY.
[2:25:27] to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
[2:25:32] to give unto them beautiful ashes, the
[2:25:35] oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
[2:25:38] praise for the spirit of heaviness, that
[2:25:41] they might be called trees of
[2:25:43] righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
[2:25:45] that he might be glorified.
[2:26:04] Now, there is something I want us TO DO,
[2:26:07] BROTHER. PUT IT ON THE SCREEN. Make it
[2:26:09] larger if you can. I want to I want to
[2:26:12] speak the bad one and you speak the good
[2:26:17] one.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; All right. You get it?
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Ashes,
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; beauty.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to say it with me now.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Ashes.
[2:26:34] Hallelujah.

[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; THE GARMENT OF THE SPIRIT OF HEAVEN.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,

[2:27:14] to see
[2:27:16] that there is a season
[2:27:19] that at a right time for God to do
[2:27:22] something.
[2:27:24] You realize this scripture we just read
[2:27:28] is a prophecy about our generation.
[2:27:33] IT'S NO LONGER TIME
[2:27:36] FOR MOURNING.
[2:27:40] THAT'S WHY THE PENTECOSTALS
[2:27:42] ARE STILL GOING ON THE MOUNTAIN FOR 40
[2:27:46] DAYS FOR THE NIGHT
[2:27:50] FOR REVIVAL. REVIVAL. REVIVAL. THE
[2:27:53] BRIGHT REVIVAL IS ALREADY HERE.

[2:28:34] HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
[2:28:36] THAT COMES BY THE DECLARATION
[2:28:39] OF THE RIGHT SEASON, THE RIGHT TIME.
[2:28:42] AND THEN HE SAYS THIS DAY, THIS
[2:28:45] SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED.
[2:28:48] BROTHER

[2:28:54] WAS FULFILLED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE

[2:29:40] YOUR TIME OF ASHES IS OVER.
[2:29:43] YOUR TIME OF THE SPIRIT OF HEAVINESS
[2:29:46] IS OVER. IF YOU HAVE A SPIRIT OF
[2:29:49] HEAVINESS IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LIKE
[2:29:52] JESUS DID, I CAST IT OUT OF YOU. THE
[2:29:56] TIME OF HEAVINESS IS OVER. LET GO AND
[2:30:00] LET GOD COME IN AND LET HIM DO HIS
[2:30:03] PERFECT WORK IN YOU. LET HIM BRING FULL
[2:30:06] adoption
[2:30:08] by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is a time of beauty. It's a time
[2:30:13] of joy. Amen. Why? Because God has moved
[2:30:17] on the scene in this generation.

[2:31:40] That's the message of the hour.
[2:31:43] What you think was broken,
[2:31:46] what you think was western,
[2:31:48] is a time of rebuilding. I don't know
[2:31:51] who I'M TALKING TO TODAY. BUT I AM SURE
[2:31:54] I FEEL in my spirit. God is ministering
[2:31:57] to someone here.

[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Someone called me,
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; the man who is selling us the church
[2:33:51] line and told me, "Pastor,
[2:33:55] uh, someone wants your church line."
[2:33:59] Uh, and he's he wants to give you 20
[2:34:01] more million.
[2:34:04] I said, "No, sorry, I'm not saying."
[2:34:08] I said, "Okay." I've talked to him
[2:34:10] again. He's adding 40 more millions.
[2:34:14] I said, "No, we're not selling."
[2:34:17] 40 more millions.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Those are riches of the Gentiles.
[2:34:23] But we have to determine what we want to
[2:34:25] eat.
[2:34:29] They should give us one more one more
[2:34:31] 100 meals. Then
[2:34:33] we will think about it.
[2:34:38] LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, GOD IS FIXING
[2:34:40] AT THIS TIME IN THIS SEASON TO DO THINGS
[2:34:44] WHICH WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.

[2:37:46] It's a SEASON OF REJOICING.
[2:37:49] IT'S A SEASON OF REJOICING.
[2:37:52] IT'S A SEASON OF REJOICING.
[2:37:54] IF YOU HAVE BEEN HEAVY IN YOUR HEART,
[2:37:57] PREPARE FOR REJOICING.
[2:38:00] PREPARE FOR REJOICING.
[2:38:02] I SAID PREPARE FOR REJOICING.
[2:38:05] DON'T LOOK AT ME AS IF I'M TALKING TO
[2:38:06] SOMEONE.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; I AM TALKING TO YOU.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; PREPARE FOR REJOICING.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you. GO BACK YOUR SEATS.
[2:38:18] THEREFORE,
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; IN THEIR LAND,
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; IN THEIR LAND THEY SHALL POSSESS THE
[2:38:25] DEVIL.
[2:38:30] Oh my GOOD LORD. THEY SHALL POSSESS THE
[2:38:33] DOUBLE.
[2:38:36] EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UNTO THEM.
[2:38:41] YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET DOUBLE ANYWHERE
[2:38:42] ELSE.
[2:38:44] YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET DOUBLE IN
[2:38:46] EGYPT.
[2:38:47] YOU ARE GETTING DOUBLE IN YOUR LAND.
[2:38:50] IN THE MESSAGE LAND, IN THE HOLY GHOST
[2:38:53] LAND, IN CAN LAND, YOU ARE GETTING
[2:38:57] DOUBLE IN YOUR LAND.
[2:39:00] YOU ARE GETTING DOUBLE IN THE PROMISE
[2:39:01] WHICH IS FULFILLED.
[2:39:05] Everlasting joy
[2:39:08] shall be unto them.
[2:39:12] Blessed be the man that walketh not in
[2:39:16] the counsel of the ungodly,
[2:39:19] nor standeth in the in the way of
[2:39:21] sinners,
[2:39:22] nor sitth in the seat of the scornful,
[2:39:25] BUT HIS DELIGHT
[2:39:27] IS IN THE LAW OF THE LORD. AND IN HIS
[2:39:30] LAW DOES HE MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT, AND
[2:39:33] IT SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY THE
[2:39:36] RIVERS OF WATER, AND BRINGETH FORTH HIS
[2:39:40] FRUIT,
[2:39:41] IN HIS SEASON, HIS LEAF ALSO SHALL NOT
[2:39:44] WITHER,
[2:39:46] AND WHATSOEVER HE DOETH
[2:39:49] SHALL PROSPER.
[2:39:52] I SAID, SHALL PROSPER.
[2:39:56] Now he shall in the resurrection of the
[2:39:58] tree says now he shall bring forth
[2:40:01] HIS FRUIT. GOD IS FRUIT IN HIS SEASON.
[2:40:06] Watch each his
[2:40:09] personal pronoun there HIS
[2:40:12] IT IS HIS FRUIT. GOD IS FREE IN THE
[2:40:16] SEASON THAT THE PROPHET IS BRINGING.
[2:40:22] The angel brings the fruit
[2:40:26] in God season.
[2:40:30] GOD HAS A SEASON,
[2:40:33] A CERTAIN SEASON WHEN THE ANGEL brings
[2:40:36] the fruit.
[2:40:39] BLESSED BE THE MAN. AMEN. THAT WALKETH
[2:40:42] NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNTH
[2:40:50] is in the law of the Lord.
[2:40:53] And he SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY
[2:40:56] THE RIVERS OF WATER THAT BRINGETH FORTH
[2:40:59] HIS FRUIT.
[2:41:01] GOD IS FRUIT IN THE PROPHET SEASON.
[2:41:07] HALLELUJAH. Brother says the New
[2:41:09] Testament preacher is a prophet.
[2:41:14] Hallelujah.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; So in this service, little service,
[2:41:18] I am God's angel to you now.
[2:41:23] Hallelujah.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; So which means I am not only to come and
[2:41:26] preach.
[2:41:28] I am dust to come and cause things to
[2:41:30] happen.
[2:41:34] Amen.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; The one who has revelation will see it.
[2:41:40] Hallelujah.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; You get the point, brother. Amen.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that angel came, that angel
[2:41:45] was not God,
[2:41:47] but it was the angel of the Lord. WHEN
[2:41:49] HE CAME DOWN, he brought the healing
[2:41:53] with you.
[2:41:58] And Jesus came to SYMBOLIZE OR SHOW
[2:42:00] SOMETHING. THE OTHER WAS A SHADOW.
[2:42:04] But Jesus was the reality.
[2:42:07] So he told me, "You don't need to wait
[2:42:08] FOR THAT ANGEL ANYMORE. I am healed."
[2:42:11] Hallelujah.
[2:42:13] And what did he do? He brought healing.
[2:42:16] Jesus never prayed for healing.
[2:42:19] He gave healing.
[2:42:25] If you read IN THE BIBLE, HE TELLS YOU
[2:42:27] GO. JESUS TOLD HIS DISCIPLES, "GO CAST
[2:42:30] DEMONS, CLEANSE LEPERS."
[2:42:33] THEY HAD THE POWER TO DO THOSE THINGS.
[2:42:37] AND THE BRIDE TODAY IS IN THAT SEASON OF
[2:42:41] FULL ADOPTION,
[2:42:44] FULL RESTORATION.
[2:42:47] THAT'S WHAT THE THIRD POOL IS.
[2:42:50] THAT'S WHAT THE WORD DOES. IT RESTORES
[2:42:52] US BACK AGAIN TO THAT SAME AUTHORITY.
[2:42:57] IT'S NO LONGER HERE, GOD. HE'S NOW
[2:43:00] HEARING HIM
[2:43:02] WHO A SON OF GOD FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[2:43:05] GHOST. HE'S SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GOD
[2:43:09] AND THINGS WILL MATERIALIZE.
[2:43:14] AMEN. AMEN. IT IS GOD'S FRUIT
[2:43:17] IN THE SEASON THE PROPHET IS BRINGING
[2:43:19] IN.
[2:43:21] GOD IS FRUIT IN GOD'S TIME
[2:43:24] BY THE PROPHET'S SEASON. He shall bring
[2:43:26] forth his fruit in his season.
[2:43:29] So if there isn't two he's there bring
[2:43:32] forth he is God's fruit now he'll bring
[2:43:34] now he says it cannot wither
[2:43:42] is God predestinated fruit in there
[2:43:47] can't be destroyed because it is
[2:43:49] PREDESTINATED
[2:43:55] praise God
[2:43:58] I want to finish reading the quote. The
[2:44:01] seed is not held with the
[2:44:06] just pray we get it.
[2:44:09] He says the world is in a sodom
[2:44:10] condition
[2:44:12] and the church has went into Sodom with
[2:44:14] it
[2:44:16] and Lot and his wife and I say that
[2:44:19] there IS A ELECTED CHURCH somewhere
[2:44:24] in this world
[2:44:26] that's pulled out and set aside from
[2:44:29] those THINGS
[2:44:32] and the manifestation of God
[2:44:36] has attracted its attention.
[2:44:41] The manifestation of God
[2:44:44] has attracted my attention.
[2:44:48] The manifestation OF GOD has attracted
[2:44:52] our attention.
[2:44:55] We are no longer at a time of only
[2:44:58] believing and hearing things.
[2:45:02] A time of manifestation.
[2:45:07] Hallelujah.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; THE SHARK HAS GIVEN FORTH HIS STRENGTH
[2:45:10] INTO THE SEA.
[2:45:14] It went on out.
[2:45:17] It was a good shack,
[2:45:19] but it served its time.
[2:45:21] WE ARE NO LONGER AT THE TIME OF THE
[2:45:23] SHEEP.
[2:45:24] FOR THE SEED IS NOT H WITH THE SHEEP.
[2:45:28] IT IS THE WORD BRIDE
[2:45:31] OF THE WORD GROOM,
[2:45:34] THE NATURAL SEED OF ABRAHAM
[2:45:37] ISAAC AND JACOB. NATURAL SEED RATHER OF
[2:45:38] ISHMAEL, NATURAL SEED OF Isaac and SO
[2:45:40] FORTH AND HAD TO GO INTO THE ground in
[2:45:42] order to bring out this other one.
[2:45:50] And so has all these others.
[2:45:53] THE SEED HAS TO DRY. I MEAN THE SHARK
[2:45:56] HAS TO DRY RATHER. AND THE POLLEN HAS TO
[2:45:58] DRY AND EVERYTHING DIES SO THE SEED can
[2:46:02] produce itself.
[2:46:05] That's the WAY IT IS BEEN IN EVERY AGE.
[2:46:09] Denomination has been the carriers.
[2:46:13] Part of that is the word
[2:46:15] for it has been hid from the wise
[2:46:17] reformers
[2:46:22] or sealed away from them until the age
[2:46:25] of the ego has appeared
[2:46:30] a certain season.
[2:46:34] The Bible says so. Yes sir. BECAUSE WE
[2:46:37] ARE PROMISED
[2:46:38] THAT IN Malachi 4 exactly we ARE HE'S
[2:46:43] HIDDEN FROM THE EYES OF the wise and THE
[2:46:44] PRUDENT
[2:46:47] AND as we just went through the book of
[2:46:48] revelation WE FIND OUT THAT ALL THREE of
[2:46:50] those messengers
[2:46:54] all those beasts that went forth each
[2:46:56] one suited Luther just right each one
[2:46:58] seated the other one just right and
[2:47:00] which is the ox and the different
[2:47:02] animals of the Bible it went forth to
[2:47:03] justification sanctification even into
[2:47:06] the Pentecostals to bring but the fourth
[2:47:09] was an eagle. So then he begins to talk
[2:47:11] about the four beasts.
[2:47:14] Of course we know them as the lion, the
[2:47:16] horse and the the face of man and then
[2:47:20] the flying eagle. Those are the four
[2:47:22] anointings
[2:47:24] of God in different seasons.
[2:47:27] BUT NOW BUT NOW WE ARE IN A SEASONAL
[2:47:33] OF A FLYING EGO.
[2:47:38] IT HAS TO COME THROUGH
[2:47:41] AND THROUGH THAT AGE GOD RAISED IT UP.
[2:47:44] IT HAS TO come through that age to be
[2:47:46] correct.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The ego promise being fulfilled
[2:47:50] but Malachi THOUGHT
[2:47:54] Jesus was not OF MARY
[2:47:57] but came through Mary
[2:48:00] like the life through the sha.
[2:48:03] We've gone through all those
[2:48:04] denominational ages,
[2:48:07] but now it's another season. We've
[2:48:10] arrived, we have arrived at another
[2:48:12] time,
[2:48:13] the time of the flying eagle,
[2:48:16] flying higher than all the other
[2:48:18] denominational ideas and creators.
[2:48:23] We at a time of full adoption,
[2:48:27] full restoration
[2:48:29] of the bride
[2:48:31] is the bride coming of Christ
[2:48:34] revealing the very works doing the same
[2:48:36] works he did.
[2:48:40] That's why brother Bam says that now
[2:48:44] God has actually revealed one of the
[2:48:47] mysteries that he has revealed in this
[2:48:48] day
[2:48:51] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:48:53] without sensation
[2:48:55] but doing the very same works. Let me
[2:48:57] read it for you. I want you to see
[2:48:58] something.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to see something for our
[2:49:06] Amen. It says the mystery of the baptism
[2:49:08] of the Holy Ghost without sensation but
[2:49:12] the person of Christ performing in you
[2:49:14] the same works that he did.
[2:49:19] Some people think here that sensation is
[2:49:21] not there.
[2:49:23] Now what brother Bam is saying he's
[2:49:25] talking about the Pentecostal SHOCK
[2:49:28] HOW when they shouted they thought THEY
[2:49:33] when they spoke in tong THEY THOUGHT
[2:49:34] THEY WHEN THEY FELL ON the phone they
[2:49:36] thought THEY BUT THEY DON'T GO BEYOND
[2:49:38] THAT WHAT IS IT THE PERSON OF THE HOLY
[2:49:42] GHOST IS MORE THAN SENSATION
[2:49:46] SENSATION WILL COME WITH IT BUT IT IS
[2:49:49] MORE THAN SENSATION WHAT IS IT IS CHRIST
[2:49:52] HIMSELF THE PERSON OF CHRIST
[2:49:55] WHERE IN YOU PERFORMING IN YOU
[2:50:00] THE SAME WORKS
[2:50:02] THAT HE DID.
[2:50:05] WHICH WORKS DID HE DO WHEN THE SEASON
[2:50:07] WAS RIGHT? HE CAME AT BETHESDA AND HE
[2:50:11] TOLD THAT MAN TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK.
[2:50:14] AMEN. HE CAME TO THIS man with A BOY
[2:50:17] WITH SIN. TOOK AWAY HIM BY THE HAND AND
[2:50:21] SAID, "RECEIVE YOUR HEALING. RECEIVE
[2:50:23] YOUR SIGHT." And I'm here also SAYING
[2:50:26] THE SAME THING. WHAT IS IT? THE BAPTISM
[2:50:28] OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S NOT ME, YOUR
[2:50:31] BROTHER. IT IS GOD IN ME GIVING THOSE
[2:50:35] DECLARATIONS
[2:50:36] SPEAKING TO YOU THE WORD. WHO IS IT? IT
[2:50:40] IS THE SAME JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME
[2:50:42] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER,
[2:50:46] PERFORMING THE SAME WORKS.
[2:50:48] SO WHAT IS YOUR NEED?
[2:50:52] YOU YOU WANT A CHILD. AMEN. AMEN.
[2:50:57] RECEIVE YOUR CHILD.
[2:50:59] AS SIMPLE AS THAT. MARY SAID, "BE IT
[2:51:02] UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE AND WHOM
[2:51:04] IT WILL HAPPEN." JUST LIKE THAT. WHAT
[2:51:07] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS NOT WHAT
[2:51:09] THE PENTECOSTALS ARE DOING. THIS IS AN
[2:51:12] ADOPTED SON SPEAKING BY AUTHORITY.
[2:51:17] RECEIVE YOUR HEALING.
[2:51:20] AMEN. WHAT ABOUT YOU, BROTHER? AMEN. WHO
[2:51:22] HAS BEEN SUFFERING FOR SO LONG? DO YOU
[2:51:25] WANT TO BELIEVE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU
[2:51:28] right now that it is your season?
[2:51:32] It is your season.
[2:51:34] Some of you, even when you go back home,
[2:51:36] you have nothing to eat.
[2:51:41] RECEIVE YOUR FOOD.
[2:51:43] I SAID RECEIVE YOUR FOOD. RECEIVE YOUR
[2:51:46] FOOD.
[2:51:47] AMEN. RECEIVE A NEW JOB, A BRAND NEW
[2:51:50] JOB.
[2:51:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:55] YOU CALL THAT EXCITEMENT. NO,
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S not excitement.
[2:52:00] IT'S BELIEVING THE WORD. WHEN THE SEASON
[2:52:02] IS RIGHT, THIS MAN LYING DOWN THERE FOR
[2:52:07] 38 YEARS.
[2:52:11] And then Jesus comes and he says, "CAN
[2:52:14] YOU BE MADE WHOLE? CAN YOU BE MADE
[2:52:16] WHOLE? AND I ASK YOU AS I FINISH
[2:52:19] TONIGHT, CAN YOU BE MADE WHOLE? CAN YOU
[2:52:22] COME OUT OF YOUR SITUATION?
[2:52:24] CAN YOU BE HEALED? DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
[2:52:28] THIS MAN STARTED COMPLAINING. I HAVE NO
[2:52:30] ONE TO HELP ME. STOP LOOKING AT PEOPLE.
[2:52:34] DON'T LOOK AT PEOPLE. DON'T HAVE YOUR
[2:52:36] MIND ON PEOPLE.
[2:52:39] PEOPLE HAVE FAILED YOU. PEOPLE WILL FAIL
[2:52:41] YOU. THERE IS NO HOPE IN PEOPLE.
[2:52:45] LOOK AT HIM WHO IS HERE IN THIS SEASON
[2:52:49] CARRY YOU OUT OF YOUR SITUATION.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "Stand up. CARRY
[2:52:58] YOUR BED. TAKE UP YOUR BED and walk.
[2:53:05] I feel like preaching right now."
[2:53:08] AMEN. STAND UP, BROTHER. STAND UP,
[2:53:11] SISTER. CARRY YOUR BED and walk. Maybe
[2:53:15] I've BEEN HAVING AN ADDICTION, A VERY
[2:53:17] STINKING ADDICTION.
[2:53:20] STAND UP, CARRY YOUR BED AND WALK.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU HAVE SUFFERED. YOUR
[2:53:27] FAMILY HAS SUFFERED.
[2:53:29] AMEN. STAND UP, CARRY YOUR BED AND WALK.
[2:53:32] TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK. COME OUT OF
[2:53:34] THAT COMFORT ZONE OF THINKING YOU WILL
[2:53:37] DIE LIKE THIS. NO. WE HAVE A GOD WHO IS
[2:53:40] ALIVE. A GOD WHO CHANGES SITUATION. AND
[2:53:44] HE'S ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE
[2:53:48] SEASON OF THE BRINGER.
[2:53:51] THE SEASON OF THE BRINGER.
[2:53:53] THE ANGEL IS HERE.
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT ONLY ME. WE ARE
[2:53:58] TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER ANGEL.
[2:54:01] HALLELUJAH. He is here right now to
[2:54:04] accomplish his word. Maybe you have been
[2:54:07] having the spirit of heaviness
[2:54:09] DISAPPOINTED FOR SO LONG AND YOU HAVE
[2:54:12] YOU'RE TIRED OF PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T
[2:54:14] FORGIVE THEM.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; LET GO OF THAT
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; AND WALK OUT OF THAT CONDITION BECAUSE
[2:54:20] THAT IS A PRISON
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; WHICH WILL KILL YOU FOREVER.
[2:54:24] COME OUT OF IT AND RECEIVE YOUR HEALING.
[2:54:27] Or maybe you HAVE BEEN HAVING A DEMON
[2:54:29] THAT HAS BEEN ATTACKING WANT TO DESTROY
[2:54:32] YOUR LIFE. AM I PREACHING TO someone
[2:54:34] here today? You know you can walk out of
[2:54:36] it right now
[2:54:38] just like that. Just like that.
[2:54:43] Just like that.
[2:54:48] Just like that. JUST LIKE THAT. What if
[2:54:51] you believe it? Stand on your feet right
[2:54:52] now.
[2:54:54] Lift up your hands. Close your eyes.
[2:54:56] Worship the Lord.
[2:54:58] Say, "Lord, I believe."
[2:55:00] Lord, I believe. We are in the season of
[2:55:04] the bringer.
[2:55:06] He has spoken to you right now. Amen.
[2:55:09] Glory to God. Glory to God. He is here
[2:55:11] now.
[2:55:13] to perform his word. That's what brother
[2:55:15] Bham would say at such a time as this.
[2:55:19] And then he would say, he is here. The
[2:55:22] Holy Spirit. But let me tell you
[2:55:25] friends, he's not only here, he's in
[2:55:28] you. He's in me and speaking to you
[2:55:31] right now.
[2:55:33] And now I put every spirit
[2:55:36] under the control of the Holy Ghost
[2:55:39] for the glory of God.
[2:55:44] Every demon that has been attacking you
[2:55:47] young people
[2:55:49] causing you to live in life of sin.
[2:55:52] I CAST IT OUT. COME OUT. COME OUT OF
[2:55:56] THEM. YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER THEM. For
[2:55:59] they belong to Jesus. Yes, they belong
[2:56:02] to this word of the hour today. What God
[2:56:05] has done in our day,
[2:56:07] if you've been having a spirit of
[2:56:08] heaviness,
[2:56:10] receive your deliverance.

[2:56:24] CAN, BUT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING
[2:56:26] THAT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; YES, you can. It's not about what you
[2:56:30] have done about it. It's about the
[2:56:34] season. When the season is right, then
[2:56:37] God moves. And that's the impossible.
[2:56:41] Your family in confusion.
[2:56:43] Disagreement with your husband.
[2:56:46] Let me tell you, that's a spirit that
[2:56:48] can't destroy you.

[3:15:43] Hallelujah.
[3:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:46] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother.
[3:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus cares.
[3:15:54] Now, can I have the two brothers come
[3:15:56] over here? Let us just sing this one
[3:15:58] song and then we are going to go for a
[3:15:59] meeting. If brother Joel, you can bring
[3:16:02] those files, all the files. We're going
[3:16:04] to go to a quick meeting just about 20
[3:16:06] minutes and then we'll dismiss. So,
[3:16:08] let's sing this as we are waiting for
[3:16:09] brother Joel. Brother Joel, can you go
[3:16:11] and bring the files please?
[3:16:14] God bless you church.
[3:16:19] God bless you, church.
[3:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm still lost.
[3:16:32] &gt;&gt; Come up here. Come up here.
[3:16:35] &gt;&gt; I may start narrating
[3:16:39] nearly the past 19 years of my life and
[3:16:43] you will have to spend a lot of time
[3:16:45] here. But I promise you
[3:16:50] Let me just give a a brief testimony.
[3:16:55] &gt;&gt; So when I was in hospital,
[3:17:04] the doctors asked me how have you been
[3:17:06] managing to to go to school and
[3:17:14] this is a telescope.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; This is called a telescope.
[3:17:18] would sit in front here
[3:17:23] with a chalkboard about a meter away.
[3:17:31] They could use a microscope
[3:17:35] to read from what is on the blackboard.
[3:17:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't know how I even
[3:17:47] was blind but it could see.
[3:17:49] &gt;&gt; I just got to realize it. The doctors
[3:17:52] were asking me
[3:17:56] why did you delay? Why did it take long
[3:18:02] to just go on?
[3:18:06] And I said okay. Now it's time for
[3:18:09] operation.
[3:18:11] You will come back next time, make a
[3:18:14] review,
[3:18:15] then we take you to the theater.
[3:18:19] So I went back the second time.
[3:18:22] When I when they told me to come back
[3:18:24] here the first time.
[3:18:27] I think I was back to Uganda for about
[3:18:29] one week and a half.
[3:18:34] Then during that time
[3:18:37] already I could see that there's a
[3:18:39] change in my sight.
[3:18:43] It's not going lower.
[3:18:47] It was becoming better.
[3:18:50] So we went back again.
[3:18:54] Then their machines wrote the results
[3:18:56] and they said
[3:18:58] it is worse.
[3:19:01] It was 0.5 now it is 0.3
[3:19:06] they said okay go back then when you get
[3:19:08] a corner you will come back.
[3:19:11] So a few weeks before
[3:19:15] then
[3:19:16] when we came back
[3:19:19] I just told that but you know
[3:19:23] if that thing is taking long just leave
[3:19:25] it.
[3:19:30] You may see that I still have a problem
[3:19:32] maybe physically or what but my sight
[3:19:35] inside is
[3:19:42] I had a white thing on my I don't know
[3:19:43] if it's still there.
[3:19:48] So my dad told me it is still there.
[3:19:51] Let's first wait for it to clear
[3:19:54] and let's go back and be certain.
[3:19:56] And I said, "Okay, no problem."
[3:19:58] &gt;&gt; And we kept on waiting and waiting. When
[3:20:01] we went back the third time, we both of
[3:20:04] us, me and dad, we went, I would read,
[3:20:06] but
[3:20:08] not much.
[3:20:11] So they told me, "Okay, now close that.
[3:20:14] You use the sick eye." Then the service
[3:20:17] I was sitting there
[3:20:19] in the service
[3:20:22] and pastor said, "Open Isaiah.
[3:20:25] I I hadn't got the scripture with my
[3:20:27] ears.
[3:20:29] So what I did I looked to the other
[3:20:30] corner
[3:20:32] that corner where you see that word.
[3:20:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That is where I got the scripture
[3:20:38] from.
[3:20:41] before before
[3:20:44] turning here to read what is here was a
[3:20:46] problem
[3:20:48] when I'm reading it would be a very
[3:20:53] that's why I just I was quiet but
[3:20:55] smiling I was
[3:20:59] indeed God cares
[3:21:06] I have a miracle working I have
[3:21:10] I have a miracle working.
[3:21:14] I have a miracle working.

[3:31:48] Since he loved me,
[3:31:52] since he loved me
[3:31:54] when I was even not worthy,
[3:31:57] who am I for him to love me that much
[3:32:02] and he died for me?
[3:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless you.
[3:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32:14] When you are happy, you sing a song.
[3:32:21] &gt;&gt; There's nothing can about it.
[3:32:27] When you are happy, you sing and dance.
[3:32:32] Glory to God.
[3:32:35] For great things he has done.
[3:32:38] Amen. Please be seated.
[3:32:42] Maybe before I dismiss the service,
[3:32:45] just wanted to
[3:32:49] uh to let you know I have two brothers
[3:32:51] here that I know of,
[3:32:55] a brother and a family
[3:32:58] that have uh that told me that they have
[3:33:01] uh decided to make this church their
[3:33:04] home church.
[3:33:10] One is so I'd like you to help me to
[3:33:13] welcome them.
[3:33:16] One is a brother called Francis.
[3:33:19] &gt;&gt; Can you stand up, brother Francis?
[3:33:21] Francis.
[3:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:24] You're welcome to give your brother
[3:33:27] as uh is um he was already in one of our
[3:33:32] morning devotions at the youth camp
[3:33:38] and uh he's coming from the place where
[3:33:41] I come from those areas there
[3:33:44] some part in western Uganda Uganda.
[3:33:47] &gt;&gt; So uh you're welcome my brother. God
[3:33:51] bless you.
[3:33:53] Amen. And and so uh also there is
[3:33:56] another family we have already announced
[3:33:58] on on Wednesday
[3:34:02] brother Edson and his family. Are you
[3:34:05] all here?
[3:34:06] &gt;&gt; Is your wife here? Can you please stand
[3:34:08] so we can see? God bless you.
[3:34:13] Uh they have uh they have three
[3:34:16] children, right?
[3:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So are they all here? Why don't
[3:34:21] you bring your family here so everybody
[3:34:23] can see you very well
[3:34:25] when they see you outside they can
[3:34:27] recognize you
[3:34:30] so was an associate minister in one of
[3:34:34] the associate ministers in brother
[3:34:35] Charles child's church in
[3:34:42] but about three years ago he moved to
[3:34:46] area
[3:34:48] and I think this was the first church
[3:34:50] where he came
[3:34:52] at the time. But of course, he's been
[3:34:54] waiting upon the Lord for leadership and
[3:34:56] direction.
[3:34:58] And so the Lord led them to come and
[3:35:00] make this their
[3:35:03] God bless you. Yeah. So that's uh what
[3:35:06] the name of your wife.
[3:35:16] Okay. So, brother has also been one of
[3:35:20] the translators of the Atoeso language
[3:35:23] message books
[3:35:27] for years now
[3:35:29] and currently he recently we started on
[3:35:33] the audio translation project
[3:35:40] and is very burdened for that. So, I
[3:35:42] believe that uh it is doing a noble
[3:35:45] work.
[3:35:47] and also he's involved with an an
[3:35:50] institution at um uh what is the name of
[3:35:54] &gt;&gt; 914
[3:35:57] in
[3:36:02] area
[3:36:03] &gt;&gt; where he's also helping them with
[3:36:05] several things.
[3:36:07] So uh it's a blessing for us
[3:36:10] uh to have him you know join the
[3:36:12] ministry
[3:36:14] uh because
[3:36:16] uh he's also a preacher of the word.
[3:36:20] I believe he will be a blessing as we
[3:36:21] will be a blessing to him. I trust that
[3:36:23] you'll be a blessing to the body.
[3:36:26] Amen. So the ministering friends,
[3:36:29] brothers,
[3:36:31] you should be happy. We are getting more
[3:36:34] hands on board.
[3:36:36] God bless you, brother.
[3:36:39] God bless you, Edith. God bless you.
[3:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, yeah.
[3:36:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:36:46] God bless you. Amen.
[3:36:49] Shalom.
