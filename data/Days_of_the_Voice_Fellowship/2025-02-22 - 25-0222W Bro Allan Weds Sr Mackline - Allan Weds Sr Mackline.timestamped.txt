[1:18:01] yet uh he was originally at evening
[1:18:04] light bright
[1:18:06] Tabernacle evening light bright
[1:18:07] Tabernacle and the Lord led him to come
[1:18:09] and join here at
[1:18:12] dvf since been a part of this
[1:18:16] Fellowship but this young lady has been
[1:18:18] with me since she was how old were
[1:18:23] you about seven
[1:18:27] years so raised her and then with my
[1:18:31] wife and then we went to
[1:18:33] Ethiopia she went back to her parents so
[1:18:36] when we returned she returned continued
[1:18:40] from where
[1:18:42] we it's a
[1:18:44] honor to see someone
[1:18:46] grow and then they get to this
[1:18:50] level and all the young people that are
[1:18:53] here should
[1:18:57] so we are going into the word of
[1:18:59] God and as you know I usually don't
[1:19:02] preach for so
[1:19:05] long if you want to hear me preach more
[1:19:07] you can come on Sunday
[1:19:10] morning but for you Kon and you brother
[1:19:13] Alan I would like you to be very
[1:19:17] attentive I know you you may not get
[1:19:19] much but you will certainly listen to it
[1:19:22] after
[1:19:26] Ephesians 5:
[1:19:30] 2 husbands love your wives even as
[1:19:33] Christ also loved the church and he gave
[1:19:35] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:19:38] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:19:39] Water by the word
[1:19:59] okay you also read 26 which says that he
[1:20:01] might sanctify and cleans it with the
[1:20:03] washing of the Water by the word that he
[1:20:05] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:20:07] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:20:10] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:20:12] without and without blemish
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:29] so men to love their wives as their own
[1:20:32] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:20:49] himself for no man can ever yet um hated
[1:20:53] his own flesh but now nourishes and
[1:20:55] cherishes it even as the Lord the church
[1:20:58] for we are members of his body of his
[1:21:00] flesh and of his bones for this cause
[1:21:02] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:21:05] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[1:21:07] they
[1:21:08] too they too shall be one flesh this is
[1:21:11] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[1:21:14] Christ and the
[1:21:23] church for
[1:22:00] may the Lord bless you I want to speak
[1:22:02] to you uh this
[1:22:05] morning on a subject I have titled
[1:22:07] Christ redeems his
[1:22:13] bride Christ redeems his
[1:22:17] bride nice to see you brother
[1:22:19] Dan is
[1:22:21] representing God bless you
[1:22:25] now um I'm speaking on Christ redeems
[1:22:28] his
[1:22:31] bride your neighbor Christ redeems his
[1:22:36] bride so now I'm dividing my thoughts
[1:22:39] today or my thought today into two
[1:22:44] parts and so I'm going to speak on what
[1:22:46] is to
[1:22:49] redeem and then I will speak also on who
[1:22:52] is the bride
[1:22:55] and then we shall go to The
[1:22:57] Vow is that
[1:23:00] amen now uh I want you to be comfortable
[1:23:03] we are a Bible believing church
[1:23:07] here we have no book but the
[1:23:10] Bible we have no but
[1:23:13] love we have no membership but
[1:23:16] fellow we have noed but
[1:23:20] Christ and the believer should be
[1:23:21] shouting amen right
[1:23:23] now and we believe the blood of
[1:23:26] Jesus wases us from all
[1:23:29] sin so let us
[1:23:31] relax amen and and and and so that we
[1:23:35] can make them also get I know they are
[1:23:37] nervous I'm trying to make them
[1:23:41] relax hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:45] amen like the singers we are singing the
[1:23:47] Lord has done it
[1:23:50] again the the message of Our Generation
[1:23:55] brother William
[1:23:56] Bram gave a very good
[1:24:00] definition to the question on what
[1:24:05] Redemption
[1:24:08] is in a book called
[1:24:13] church and I want to quote that for
[1:24:17] you while I start to try and explain to
[1:24:21] you what is to redeem
[1:24:24] now he says hold this carefully in
[1:24:29] mind now take the next
[1:24:32] step redeem means to buy
[1:24:38] back it restores to the original
[1:24:44] owner God by his
[1:24:47] death he shed blood both back his own
[1:24:56] let me read that again God by his
[1:24:59] death the shed
[1:25:01] blood that blood bought back his
[1:25:07] own he was not looking for new
[1:25:10] one whoever he
[1:25:13] redeemed are just the ones that were
[1:25:16] lost he just B them
[1:25:19] back the devil had chained
[1:25:22] them but he bought them back
[1:25:26] that's what it means to
[1:25:27] redeem he brought back the spoken word
[1:25:30] seed
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:34] bride whoever believes the word is a
[1:25:38] spoken word seed
[1:25:43] bride you will get these things as we
[1:25:45] continue here he says my sheep hear my
[1:25:49] voice what is his voice his voice is his
[1:25:53] word
[1:25:55] and they follow
[1:25:56] me you always was a
[1:26:00] sheep God does not redeem
[1:26:04] dogs he doesn't redeem
[1:26:07] pigs and makes them
[1:26:10] sheep he only redeems the sheep that was
[1:26:15] lost that's why he says my sheep here my
[1:26:20] voice when he sends his word
[1:26:24] his word his seed
[1:26:31] word and so she's lost but you see this
[1:26:35] word when she hears this word then she
[1:26:36] gets bought
[1:26:39] back she gets redeemed back so you were
[1:26:43] always a
[1:26:45] sheep even when you were still in

[1:26:55] snake you have always been a child of
[1:26:59] God you never wear a pig or a dog turned
[1:27:03] into a
[1:27:07] sheep have some believers who can
[1:27:10] help he says that is
[1:27:13] impossible for every kind of
[1:27:16] Life produces the same
[1:27:19] kind and there is no change in species
[1:27:26] as we were in the thoughts of
[1:27:29] God and then we were expressed in
[1:27:34] flesh the things I'm quoting for you
[1:27:37] here are even higher
[1:27:39] than a university Professor professor's
[1:27:45] knowledge who does not know the
[1:27:47] revelation of the
[1:27:48] word so I want you to feed on it and
[1:27:52] enjoy as we were in the of
[1:27:55] God you know God he looked at Job
[1:27:59] crying as where were
[1:28:02] you where were you so in other words you
[1:28:05] were you were back in my
[1:28:08] thoughts he says as we were in the
[1:28:11] thoughts of
[1:28:12] God and then expressed in
[1:28:15] flesh this is not just our
[1:28:19] beginning the marriage of your father
[1:28:21] and mother was not your beginning
[1:28:26] you started before the marriage of your
[1:28:27] father
[1:28:29] and you were in the thoughts of
[1:28:32] God you just expressed into the
[1:28:36] flesh there had to come a
[1:28:39] day when you when we would hear his
[1:28:43] voice there came a day when we heard his
[1:28:48] word and hearing that voice becomes then
[1:28:51] we become aware of our father
[1:28:59] us that is why we don't believe that our
[1:29:02] name has to be removed from a book
[1:29:04] called The Book of
[1:29:08] death have you had some preachers
[1:29:10] praying like
[1:29:12] that let me set you free
[1:29:14] today they pray and they say this oh God
[1:29:18] today remove this person's name from The
[1:29:22] Book of days and put it
[1:29:25] the B
[1:29:25] of God every up and
[1:29:29] down whoever gets saved he runs and has
[1:29:33] a big
[1:29:34] duster he cleans the name from The Book
[1:29:37] of and he writes it with
[1:29:40] a in The Book of Life their God is busy
[1:29:44] doing
[1:29:46] that our
[1:29:48] God
[1:29:51] once when did he write our names in The
[1:29:55] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:29:58] the
[1:30:01] world before you did any bad or before
[1:30:04] you did any
[1:30:07] good your name was on the
[1:30:09] book so when you came here and you heard
[1:30:13] the word you only had your father's
[1:30:19] calling and then you
[1:30:22] recognized that you were a Son of
[1:30:25] God you were always a son
[1:30:29] of we heard his
[1:30:32] voice and we cried out as that prodal
[1:30:37] son me oh my
[1:30:39] father I am returning
[1:30:42] home we were just returning home we were
[1:30:47] alone Our Father redeemed

[1:30:56] is our father bought
[1:30:59] us Christ redeems his
[1:31:03] bride today Alan is redeeming his
[1:31:08] bride she has always been your
[1:31:12] wife before you were even
[1:31:15] born God knew it pled before the
[1:31:19] foundation of the
[1:31:21] world even if you did anything
[1:31:24] you could not
[1:31:26] Escape you could not Escape him even if
[1:31:29] you
[1:31:30] wanted and let me tell you this
[1:31:33] also those that are
[1:31:35] redeemed cannot be
[1:31:40] lost
[1:31:44] ameny I'm enjoying why I preach they
[1:31:47] cannot be
[1:31:48] lost the reason why I'm happy because
[1:31:51] also me I know I cannot be lost amen
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:57] even when you
[1:31:58] SE what happen that is something that he
[1:32:04] did he shed his blood on
[1:32:07] the that blood
[1:32:10] serves today yesterday and forever that
[1:32:15] blood is still
[1:32:16] powerful if he redeemed you once he will
[1:32:20] always redeem you you cannot be lost
[1:32:26] the Bible in the book of Ephesians
[1:32:29] 523 says for the husband is the head of
[1:32:32] the
[1:32:35] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[1:32:39] church he is the savior of the
[1:32:43] body Christ is the savior of the
[1:32:46] body that's follow me as bring it down
[1:32:49] to these two
[1:32:50] people in Genesis 2:15
[1:32:54] maybe today you may hear some new
[1:32:56] things but I want you to open your heart
[1:32:59] and be ready for what God has for
[1:33:01] you as you are celebrating their
[1:33:05] ceremony in Genesis
[1:33:07] 2:15 God put man in the garden to dress
[1:33:11] it and to keep
[1:33:14] it in vers 16 and
[1:33:18] 17 of
[1:33:20] Genesis he would go ahead to instruct
[1:33:22] the man
[1:33:24] not to eat of the tree of knowledge of
[1:33:27] Good and
[1:33:30] Evil after God gave this instruction to
[1:33:32] the
[1:33:34] man and you know whenever I'm having
[1:33:36] weddings I write my
[1:33:39] notes because I don't want to over
[1:33:41] preach I want to stay within the time so
[1:33:45] I'll be reading but I want to follow
[1:33:47] meos after God gave this instruction to
[1:33:49] the
[1:33:50] man the scripture says
[1:33:54] the
[1:33:55] following Genesis 2:8 says and the Lord
[1:33:58] God said is not good now remember God
[1:34:03] had already created man and gave him the
[1:34:07] garden to keep and dress and he would go
[1:34:10] ahead to instruct
[1:34:11] him don't eat of the tree of knowledge
[1:34:14] of Good and Evil after this
[1:34:17] instruction
[1:34:20] to to the man
[1:34:23] are you following me
[1:34:25] church then God in vers
[1:34:29] 18 he said it is not good that
[1:34:33] man should dwell or should be
[1:34:38] alone after he gave him the
[1:34:41] instruction of not eating from the
[1:34:44] tree so that instruction came from God
[1:34:46] to
[1:34:48] Adam after that then he said ah man it's
[1:34:52] not good for him to do
[1:34:54] to leave alone to be alone I will make
[1:34:59] Alan help
[1:35:05] meet when God gives you a
[1:35:07] wife gives you someone for
[1:35:12] you and let me let me put I always say
[1:35:16] this if a man chooses a
[1:35:19] woman and a woman
[1:35:22] accepts the way that man is is also the
[1:35:26] way that woman
[1:35:31] is if a man is a
[1:35:35] thief and a woman accepts
[1:35:38] him likely she's
[1:35:42] also if a man is
[1:35:45] an even if the woman may say I'm fine
[1:35:49] there is a problem
[1:35:52] somewhere so you can never at any
[1:35:57] time say you a bad
[1:36:00] woman if she's bad you are
[1:36:04] bad whatever she is you are whatever you
[1:36:09] are she is she's a part of
[1:36:14] you listen now I'm I'm not talking my
[1:36:18] mind I'm talking
[1:36:20] scripture he says I'll make him a help
[1:36:22] suitable
[1:36:26] makes for you the one
[1:36:31] who God consequently made a Woman by
[1:36:35] fashioning her out of the man's
[1:36:42] ribs this woman was the Bor of Bones and
[1:36:45] flesh of Flesh of this
[1:36:52] man but
[1:36:54] later in Genesis 3 and according to
[1:36:59] First Timothy
[1:37:01] 2:4 the woman was in the
[1:37:06] transgression the man would have made a
[1:37:09] choice to stay away from the woman's
[1:37:16] transgression but there was something
[1:37:18] called
[1:37:20] love love bound him to her
[1:37:26] well knowing he to
[1:37:31] Savi decided to give himself for
[1:37:35] her for her for for for for for the Adam
[1:37:40] the man to of the same
[1:37:44] sin he died because says he that sins
[1:37:49] the that s the that same Soul shall
[1:37:52] die so accepted to
[1:37:55] die so that he can save his
[1:38:00] wife this was an act of
[1:38:04] Redemption on
[1:38:08] his what have you done the word came to
[1:38:12] me God told me we should never eat now
[1:38:16] what have you done you have eaten of it
[1:38:19] now go and die in your sins I'm still
[1:38:21] righteous
[1:38:24] but Adam
[1:38:26] knew that he is the Redeemer of
[1:38:32] his a man in all situation might redeem
[1:38:36] the
[1:38:42] wife even if you see a man trying to
[1:38:45] make signs to her you must come
[1:38:52] in maybe
[1:38:55] if you see any
[1:38:57] situation
[1:39:00] enter you the savior of your
[1:39:03] wife the bible say that Christ is the
[1:39:06] Redeemer of the
[1:39:07] body the body of Christ is the
[1:39:10] church it is the bride and the
[1:39:14] wife your body is your wife my
[1:39:17] brother and you are the Redeemer of his
[1:39:20] body
[1:39:23] when the wife of Adam
[1:39:26] sinned Adam
[1:39:28] quickly he came
[1:39:31] first and he saved the wife but listen
[1:39:34] to this this is very good how did he
[1:39:38] save
[1:39:39] her he himself I don't know I don't have
[1:39:43] sound he
[1:39:45] himself he came and entered in the
[1:39:48] situation
[1:39:54] he part and shared in the
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] Sin when he became one with that sin
[1:40:02] listen he
[1:40:06] knew that because even me I have a
[1:40:11] Savi Hallelujah when my savior comes to
[1:40:14] save
[1:40:16] me he will save me with all my
[1:40:22] belongings knew what he was doing
[1:40:26] amen I hope Alan you know what you're
[1:40:32] doing when a man chooses a
[1:40:35] woman all the woman's issues you must
[1:40:38] work upon
[1:40:40] them the scripture in Genesis
[1:40:43] 3:9 and the Lord God called unto Adam
[1:40:47] and said unto him where art
[1:40:50] thou God did not call the when
[1:40:55] he but he called a
[1:40:58] man the Bible in First
[1:41:01] Corinthians
[1:41:05] 13 but I would have you
[1:41:08] know that the head of every
[1:41:12] man
[1:41:14] is Christ and the head of the woman
[1:41:19] is the man and the head of Christ is
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:25] so if the head of if the if the head of
[1:41:28] the man is
[1:41:30] Christ it
[1:41:32] means who is the what who is the body of
[1:41:37] Christ the man if the head of the woman
[1:41:41] is the
[1:41:42] man it means who is the body of the
[1:41:46] woman the woman and the Bible says
[1:41:50] Christ is the savior of his
[1:42:00] so when God came down
[1:42:03] CHR he came down to save
[1:42:06] his
[1:42:09] body when Adam came down and he found
[1:42:12] even sin he came down to serve
[1:42:17] his to redeem his brother and now when
[1:42:21] God came down
[1:42:23] come and say if if where are you but he
[1:42:27] came looking for his
[1:42:29] body a part of himesh of Flesh of Adam
[1:42:34] Adam where are you and then when Adam
[1:42:37] answered Eve was also taken care
[1:42:44] of Adam saved his
[1:42:48] body and Christ saved his
[1:42:51] body this is Redemption
[1:42:55] is Adam was always a part of
[1:42:59] God he was predestinated unto
[1:43:03] adop by
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:06] redeeming he redeemed all his Fallen
[1:43:10] estate with
[1:43:13] it let me tell youen before I continue
[1:43:17] here I am Adam's
[1:43:20] rest I am Adam's estate
[1:43:24] I believe I am
[1:43:26] redeemed let me tell you if you a child
[1:43:28] of God and you are redeemed God must

[1:43:55] control my brother Alan it is God who
[1:43:58] redeemed
[1:44:00] you when God Saves you the Devil comes
[1:44:03] to do what he comes to kill he comes to
[1:44:07] destroy he comes to wipe away everything
[1:44:10] about you see God has something called
[1:44:14] Mercy something called Grace something
[1:44:18] called that is so
[1:44:20] powerful that is what God uses
[1:44:23] when the devil wants to snatch somebody
[1:44:26] God comes down and he
[1:44:28] says through his Mercy can sayy say
[1:44:33] no when you are saved brother when God
[1:44:37] gives you a saved
[1:44:39] woman to begin a
[1:44:42] family that will have children that will
[1:44:46] serve the
[1:44:47] Lord Brother when God redeemed
[1:44:50] you he had mine in mind
[1:44:58] here very well the words I'm
[1:45:01] speaking on every wedding I am

[1:45:20] I've been LED
[1:45:23] Romans
[1:45:25] 8:29 says for whom he did
[1:45:28] for he also did
[1:45:33] predestinate to be
[1:45:35] conformed to the image of his
[1:45:39] son that he might be the first
[1:45:43] born among
[1:45:46] many
[1:45:47] moreover oh my moreover whom he did
[1:45:51] predestin
[1:45:53] them he also called and them who he
[1:45:57] called he also
[1:45:59] justifi and whom he
[1:46:01] justified also
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:05] glorified I am
[1:46:07] glorified because I'm
[1:46:10] Justified amen because I'm
[1:46:12] Justified am called by the Lord and my
[1:46:16] precious brother because you were called
[1:46:19] it means you were predestinated
[1:46:25] before you were even
[1:46:27] born by the way when you get this
[1:46:30] Revelation understanding nothing in this
[1:46:33] world worries
[1:46:36] you
[1:46:37] predestination is like knowing your
[1:46:41] destination at your beginning before
[1:46:46] you
[1:46:48] end before you even
[1:46:51] started God knew
[1:46:55] God
[1:46:56] end you
[1:46:58] start end
[1:47:00] sister there were
[1:47:02] voices Oh The Wedding shall not
[1:47:05] hold God knew it would hold why because
[1:47:09] he had it in his
[1:47:12] mind let me tell you when God wants to
[1:47:14] do
[1:47:16] something he confounds the wisdom of the
[1:47:21] wise he goes beyond what anyone
[1:47:24] thought because God can do what man
[1:47:27] cannot
[1:47:28] do sometimes he want sometimes his
[1:47:31] children to look like they cannot be
[1:47:32] able to do
[1:47:35] something end God will do it and then
[1:47:40] God will boast and say I have
[1:47:43] done so that they will not say man did
[1:47:47] it but they will say our god did it it
[1:47:52] is God who is all in
[1:47:54] all amen he was with you before you were
[1:47:57] born he was with you after you were
[1:48:00] born with you right now and he will be
[1:48:03] with you in the fut he has your future
[1:48:06] in his
[1:48:07] hands Roman Catholics they had something
[1:48:11] which they say that if you you buy
[1:48:14] it it was called an
[1:48:18] Indulgence said if
[1:48:21] P am
[1:48:24] money your
[1:48:26] sins of the past will be forgiven your
[1:48:30] sins of the present will be forgiven and
[1:48:33] your sin of the future will be forgiven
[1:48:36] that's a lie but I tell you what the
[1:48:40] Bible tells us when you accept Christ as
[1:48:44] your
[1:48:45] savior brother when you accepted
[1:48:49] Christ your past sins your
[1:48:54] and your future SE are taken
[1:49:00] care can I ask a question what does
[1:49:03] justification
[1:49:07] means oh
[1:49:09] my I left my
[1:49:12] notes let me say this
[1:49:15] justification means you have never done
[1:49:19] it in the first place
[1:49:25] it
[1:49:28] means you have been set
[1:49:32] free you are
[1:49:35] free you are free to go you didn't do
[1:49:38] anything it is different that's why
[1:49:41] Redemption is different from
[1:49:45] forgiveness forgiveness is when you do
[1:49:49] something and you being forgiven
[1:49:54] but
[1:49:55] Redemption you were never even a sinner
[1:49:58] to begin
[1:50:02] with you were a Son of God to
[1:50:06] beginning and when he shed his
[1:50:09] blood he paid a
[1:50:12] price to buy you
[1:50:14] back so because you were a son before
[1:50:17] the
[1:50:19] SE when he pays the
[1:50:21] price for the
[1:50:23] sin he does not redeem you as a
[1:50:28] sinner he redeems you as someone who has
[1:50:31] never seen
[1:50:34] begin he says you are
[1:50:36] Justified you have never seen in
[1:50:39] the that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:50:44] chist the true salvation that's why we
[1:50:47] are so crazy
[1:50:51] about that's what Jesus did for
[1:50:53] us hallelujah amen that's why when a man
[1:50:57] is choosing a woman for a
[1:51:00] wife it is like as if he's
[1:51:04] redeeming before he takes her she will
[1:51:07] confess her
[1:51:13] life and then man will say I don't
[1:51:18] care I don't

[1:56:42] like that on their
[1:56:44] weddings not here the H out the out the
[1:56:49] back is out and you go
[1:56:53] those are wonderly
[1:56:55] things they don't have a part in the
[1:56:57] church let the Christian say
[1:57:01] Amen the bride of Christ the
[1:57:06] B that she has prepared herself and to
[1:57:10] her was granted that she should be
[1:57:11] arrayed in fine
[1:57:15] linen clean and
[1:57:18] white for the fine L is the
[1:57:20] righteousness
[1:57:23] the bride of
[1:57:25] Christ has a
[1:57:28] fin the
[1:57:31] word the bride is the Glorious
[1:57:35] Church Without spot A
[1:57:38] Wrinkle In The Blood of the
[1:57:41] word there are two
[1:57:44] churches both in the framework of
[1:57:47] Christianity there are two Vines there
[1:57:50] are two seeds one is true and another is
[1:57:54] false this has been throughout all
[1:57:58] generations you have a k you have you
[1:58:05] have you know and in Matthew
[1:58:09] 244 the Bible says these two spirits in
[1:58:11] the end
[1:58:14] time would walk so
[1:58:18] close to each other the if it were
[1:58:23] possible the El would be
[1:58:30] de but I've just told you
[1:58:32] Brethren that the
[1:58:35] elect cannot be deceived why he was
[1:58:40] redeemed how many know that song
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:53] redeem I'm
[1:58:57] redeemed
[1:59:02] forever I can never be
[1:59:07] lost so it is impossible to deceive
[1:59:11] the but this false
[1:59:15] system who is not truly the
[1:59:19] bride but she's in the framework of
[1:59:21] Christi
[1:59:25] has a form
[1:59:29] ofies the power of the
[1:59:33] word she denies it you will quote
[1:59:36] scriptures to us she will
[1:59:39] refuse because a heart is not after the
[1:59:42] word of
[1:59:47] the our heart is after pleasing our
[1:59:52] but the mark of the
[1:59:54] Bride is she will be submissive to the
[2:00:00] bridegroom she will not be led by
[2:00:03] organized religion and
[2:00:07] denomination she will submit
[2:00:10] only only to the
[2:00:13] voice of the
[2:00:16] brieg she has a longing in her
[2:00:20] heart come
[2:00:22] Lord Jesus
[2:00:24] come the false Church
[2:00:27] system will not follow the
[2:00:32] word the interest is not to please the
[2:00:36] Lord but to please
[2:00:39] herself she is not the
[2:00:42] bride those who submit to such a
[2:00:45] system you will find them believing all
[2:00:47] sorts of
[2:00:50] things all other voes
[2:00:53] you know what a prostitute does she
[2:00:56] listens to this
[2:00:59] man as long as it makes her
[2:01:01] happy if there is
[2:01:03] money but a true
[2:01:06] bride a
[2:01:07] true like I've been married with my wife
[2:01:11] for this year 12 years
[2:01:15] now she has never even winked at another
[2:01:19] man
[2:01:23] never
[2:01:25] not look at and WIS a man Wings then she
[2:01:31] smiles it has
[2:01:34] never if you're a man and you here
[2:01:39] you that's a
[2:01:43] true that who are you talking
[2:01:45] toar of your
[2:01:48] bus she has never done
[2:01:56] why
[2:02:01] that's when other brothers
[2:02:08] come you just
[2:02:12] look IM you say swe look at that
[2:02:18] maning and then man will say this woman
[2:02:21] is
[2:02:24] because they led by
[2:02:27] another they are not the bride but you
[2:02:30] are the
[2:02:31] bride you are a
[2:02:34] bride other voices the Church of Jesus
[2:02:39] which the of the
[2:02:42] church and yet she is not the bride
[2:02:45] there is a difference between the church
[2:02:47] and the
[2:02:49] bride and in five minutes I'm finishing
[2:02:52] the church and the bride the church
[2:02:55] follows what makes her
[2:02:59] happy you find women dressed in
[2:03:03] pants the Bible does not allow women to
[2:03:06] dress
[2:03:08] trousers but for them they do it because
[2:03:11] it makes them
[2:03:12] happy and they in church you find them
[2:03:17] throwing saying they dancing for Jes
[2:03:21] I am dancing for
[2:03:25] Jesus that is not the the
[2:03:28] bride but it is the
[2:03:31] church
[2:03:33] not she's listen to other
[2:03:36] voes but God has a
[2:03:38] bride and that bride is all over the
[2:03:42] world she will listen to no
[2:03:45] other this other woman she will do many
[2:03:48] other things that other voices will tell
[2:03:51] her
[2:03:52] she will baptize
[2:03:54] babies the Bible doesn't allow she will
[2:03:57] allow women
[2:04:00] preachers the Bible doesn't
[2:04:03] allow will believe in three
[2:04:06] Gods Bible
[2:04:09] doesn't she will dress any way they
[2:04:12] want the Bible doesn't
[2:04:15] allow she will pay for
[2:04:18] prayers prayer as if you have gone to a
[2:04:21] doctor
[2:04:23] that you have you have to pay they pay
[2:04:26] for
[2:04:28] prayers those are not
[2:04:31] churches but to the Servants of
[2:04:34] God freely you
[2:04:37] receive freely you g without money
[2:04:40] without
[2:04:42] price you see in
[2:04:45] this in this church she will tolerate
[2:04:49] fornication
[2:04:52] the gra of God is instead of encouraging
[2:04:55] young people
[2:04:58] to they toate
[2:05:01] things to the extent today as we as I'm
[2:05:05] looking
[2:05:06] at church worldwide in many
[2:05:10] denominations they have tolerated and
[2:05:12] accepted
[2:05:16] homosexuality is offal
[2:05:22] why she is not the
[2:05:25] bride she's not the bride she has to the
[2:05:29] spirit of
[2:05:31] Jezebel to dominate over her instead of
[2:05:34] accepting the spirit of the
[2:05:36] word but there is a true
[2:05:39] church that bride will always submit to
[2:05:44] the
[2:05:45] word when the word says one
[2:05:49] God she will say Amen aen when the
[2:05:52] church when the Bible says
[2:05:55] baptism water in the name of the Lord
[2:05:59] Jesus
[2:06:00] Christ what will the church
[2:06:03] say the true church of
[2:06:06] the say
[2:06:09] Amen when the when the Bible says
[2:06:12] dressed in mother's
[2:06:16] clothing
[2:06:18] am you will never find one
[2:06:22] them dressed in a
[2:06:26] Min you find them dressed like
[2:06:29] that that's not the Church of the Living
[2:06:31] God a true church will
[2:06:36] dress way not only women in our
[2:06:39] generation you find
[2:06:42] men men they look like siss
[2:06:52] they begin when you see them in
[2:06:55] a is that a man
[2:06:57] woman you can't understand that's not
[2:07:00] the Bride
[2:07:05] of now the Bible
[2:07:10] says
[2:07:13] don't even it says Those Who
[2:07:17] fornicate chase them
[2:07:19] away don't even eat with them
[2:07:23] unless they repent did you know that if
[2:07:25] you knew that say
[2:07:27] Amen but our churches today they have
[2:07:33] that that's why it doesn't bother them
[2:07:36] even if they Mar when they
[2:07:39] fought after all
[2:07:43] for the True Church of
[2:07:45] Jesus not fornicate young people

[2:08:14] church and we not the only ones they all

[2:11:29] struggling stabiliz I went to my father
[2:11:34] inlaw I had nothing and I'm not ashame
[2:11:37] to

[2:12:19] I was poor according to world but I was
[2:12:22] rich and I knew what I could
[2:12:25] accomplish I had purpose I had
[2:12:30] vision and God has since lifted us
[2:12:34] up have been a blessing in the home of
[2:12:38] my parents
[2:12:41] in I took all the children to
[2:12:43] school I become their
[2:12:46] father and I'm saying this because you
[2:12:50] can B A
[2:12:52] Lea when you get married there is a way
[2:12:57] things move in your
[2:12:59] favor because God says you have a vision
[2:13:02] now you have a purpose now you have a
[2:13:05] Target now then he lifts you
[2:13:09] up then lifts you up ISAC spent here
[2:13:13] many years looking for
[2:13:15] job no jobs he went abroad didn't work
[2:13:19] out no job
[2:13:22] that's the truth that's
[2:13:27] wife when he came back still no jobs
[2:13:32] then he told me I want to get married I
[2:13:35] am always positive to someone who is
[2:13:36] mure and has vision and wants to get
[2:13:39] married I'm positive to
[2:13:44] that it's not money that
[2:13:47] marri it is
[2:13:49] maturity physical and spiritual
[2:13:52] because it brings
[2:13:57] ability and after he got
[2:13:59] married one two three months
[2:14:07] powerful there is a blessing in
[2:14:11] marriage because it is the will of
[2:14:14] God no it's okay for you to get a job
[2:14:19] which gives you 5 million
[2:14:22] to wait until you get to Mar it's
[2:14:27] okay okay figuring things out and that's
[2:14:32] okay but me I'm a man who is rugged and
[2:14:35] I work by
[2:14:41] Fai and I find I'm sorry I find it to be
[2:14:43] the way of
[2:14:48] God churches
[2:14:51] many young people this church is a
[2:14:53] church of young
[2:14:55] people I'm sorry I didn't have to say
[2:14:57] all this
[2:14:59] but in churches some of them are
[2:15:03] belies they living very immoral
[2:15:07] life but because they come to
[2:15:10] church and smiling and Dred well we
[2:15:14] think
[2:15:18] they parents who are here
[2:15:21] and who are hearing this because I know
[2:15:23] you are
[2:15:24] there this under the anointing of the
[2:15:27] holy
[2:15:28] spirit let us support our children to
[2:15:30] start
[2:15:32] families it is the will of
[2:15:35] God it is the way of the
