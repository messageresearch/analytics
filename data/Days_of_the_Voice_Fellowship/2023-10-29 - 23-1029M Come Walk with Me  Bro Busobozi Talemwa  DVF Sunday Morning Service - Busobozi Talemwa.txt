23 [Music] 1 uh we are [Music] reading the Lord is my shepherd I shall not he make me Li down in GRE pastures heed me beside the Ste water he Resto my soul he leadth me in the path of righteous for

you're welcome to the house of God to see [Music] you and [Applause] how the first time that brother heard about well of course we've been ministering [Laughter] there and so the first time I for and but then he had that was baptized she was already and very I love the way he made up when he know and something is very straight with it not only him even even the sister you know we struggled because she was seeing that she knew the truth but when this other new truth came sced to be and took away for her for my brother and were there for anybody to make decision it's a wonderful thing amen praise God uh I'm happy to see uh my brother Mr love call Brother wonderful welcome [Music] back oh yeah when you do this you don't see them when you do this you don't see them so I I I I I feel you should always find good spots if you can't see my eyes I can't see you well God can see you but uh it's good that you can see one another amen so brother Andrew was there sister doas was there and others as well also brother so uh we appreciate God for Sister by faith is wedding I always feel happy whenever a young person gets married because that is the way to go amen so this morning uh before we go to the word just write on that note I have a card here for uh brother Andrew and sister phbe and it's a pledge card I uh the brother is laughing I wanted to put your name there brother SE pledge this amount one million whatever as my contribution for the wedding preparation of Andrew and phbe scheduled for 26 January 2024 collect this money on this day so you you sign that card you give it to to I think the organizing committee they will they will supply those cards for you after the service and you can pledge something if you don't want to pledge and you just want to give you can also do that I I I believe we should support our young people getting money whoever is getting getting married in the right way we should support them how many say Amen to that we should support them and those of you who have not yet started the process don't feel bad for those ones who are already in the process as a matter of fact all all of you young people who have not yet started the process you should support with more money because I tell you if you don't brother Andrew will remember you and uh and if you support him I'm sure he will support you back but that's not the reason why you support support because you are happy for them amen so I'd like to uh also announce that uh we had a meeting last Sunday and we we made a few changes regarding our youth meetings preparations we had planned to have the youth meetings here in this place but we have changed that because we found a better venue um we were going to we were planning to have a Friday night here and then Sun Saturday and Sunday in a tent which is rented at the school and then you know we we we use the school but that is proving to be quite more expensive as well as inconvenience in many ways of course if it rained if the weather was not good would also be suffering but God gave us a good a better venue I also did not know it previously it's called past's uh what's thatw P's discipleship Network it is in you can Google it and you will be able we sent out a new flyer brother Isaac made a new flyer uh if you have a smartphone and there is a Cod there does anyone have that flyer realize some people struggle with these Technologies anybody has [Music] that yes no one it's good because that means that people don't use phones in their okay I'm trying to find it here but I can't find it right you'll have to excuse me because I did not plan to show you this but we have also we have also done a few prints yes can you uh bring it up so uh it's okay you can hold your phone so you see on this flyer there is uh there there is is a how do they call it it's not a backod it's a it's called a QR code right right here right here below so if you put your camera there like I'm doing now it will bring you a link to click and it will take you to that address so what's this address showing you that discipleship Network so anyone can will be able to find the address like that so we are going to put that also on on the website is not yet up on the website and we are sending invitations to churches uh uh uh we have already printed it so we are preparing to send it out so uh it's a very nice place you will love it so we are planning that whoever will be able to uh whoever wants can be able to sleep there so they have HS where they will put mattresses I I believe that most of the most of all all of the members of this Fellowship they should sleep there help us concentrate and Camp there and uh we are going we are planning to have a wonderful time we are praying for the young people to have an encounter with God it's a wonderful time of the year for us so uh we agreed that every member of the church will at least contribute 100,000s to help contribute towards the cause we need about uh on the new venue we needed more but now we need about 26 Millions so prepare to do that to contribute on that I don't think we should make pledge cards we can just contribute uh on our channels which we already have bring it in cash to brother Jo behind just tell him it's for the Youth meetings the brothers uh the ministers have already purchased their air tickets like I told you we are having you know brother from the US brother Timothy Brother David mayor from Switzerland May uh we have also brother morus [Music] froma we have brother uh tazwell from newal and we have many of our friends also from Kenya from Nairobi from Western Ken and from other places and around the country they are preparing to come so we need to pray for the meeting and to also contribute and and then look forward for a great wonderful wonderful time amen amen so it's only two months to go so this morning I'm speaking to you on a little subject uh of course we've been speaking on an um an Elijah uh what what what what was it the ministry of yeah told to me luganda the ministry of Elijah in the end time I thought on doing something a bit uh out of the out of the ordinary today take a question and answer service Sunday morning subject but I changed my mind I'm thinking maybe uh on Wednesday uh we could plan it this Wednesday if you have some questions on that subject it's a wide subject uh how many have questions out of that subject on the coming on the five comings of Elijah I'm not going to ask you to ask now but if you have a question just raise up your hand no one has a question okay the other one was Raising and then he noticed that other okay I'll ask again how many if you have a question just lift up your hand I want to know is there only one person okay how many we following these these seven services on Elijah okay okay how many did not have a chance to follow through okay so here's what we are going to do I'm going to ask you to go uh and follow through those services all of them if you can I believe you should if you can this Friday Friday night we're going to have a question and answer session on on on on on that subject we stream it for those who can't make it they can still send their questions and then you can deal with them but this morning I just want to take a little bit of a different time and speak on another subject not a teaching as such just something to share with us and encourage us this morning let us read again in Psalms 23 vers one I'll read one verse you read the second I read the third you read the fourth the Lord the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen amen now when we speak on uh this Psalm that David wrote David if there is something that David knew David knew he God and he knew that God was up for real business he was confident that he will always be with him and he he says here that even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou with me there is something about walking with someone I don't know if some of you have ever taken a walk a lonely walk is a very difficult thing if you walk alone it's very difficult but if you walk together with somebody you you are you are happy you have company even even the Bible says that two are better than one you know God created everything and after creating everything each of them he said it is good it is good it is good when he created man in his own image he said it is not good for man to dwell alone can you imagine because man was walking alone and God knew that man desired to walk with somebody so brother Andrew now it is not good for you to be alone but very soon brother Andrew will walk with someone in this praise God those of you who are married you are not alone you are walking with somebody that is why I believe that marriage is not just marriage to have children marriage is for Comfort marriage is you know to have somebody for companionship marriage you know you someone you can share your trouble with someone that you can go through this life's journey with someone that can understand you and someone that you can understand so in the same way you know David here speaks these words he said even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death he says I will fear no evil why won't he fear because God is with him you know you don't you don't have a lot of fear if you're walking with someone bam one time spoke of a little child a little boy going through a graveyard and you know alone and you know because of too much fear you know he tried to behave as if he was fearing nothing and walked through while [Music] whistling but really that was because of fear and many people in this life are like that little boy in a graveyard they're walking alone and because they're working alone they have too much fear they have things begin to build up anxiety builds up has build up because of too much fear fear of the unknown you know like this little boy is walking through the through you know the graveyard he's imagining things because he's all alone but if I'm walking and one of the dead bodies comes out and then it finds me alone here oh all these people are dead you know the dread the fear comes with all that even just some little wind passing scar this little boy and you know life and the world is like that graveyard and you cannot go through this graveyard without Jesus and you go through well so that's why I'm speaking to you this morning come walk with me Jesus is telling us the same come with d said even though I walk through the valley of Shadow I will fear no evil why because you are with me if you with a companion if you are with a friend no matter what comes your way you know you have hope you have someone where you can run to you have somewhere where you can receive comfort and and and you know the Bible says in the Book of Genesis 5: 24 and Enoch walked with God and he was not because God took him there is something good about walking with God if you walk alone in this journey you can never overcome the Troubles of the world will consume you the problems of the world will consum I want you to understand that both Believers and nonbelievers face the same demons in times when Temptations around us B when s like C roll as the sing songwriter said when disease and pain has gripped its victim those moments when your back has hit against a wall you need to be able to speak like David spoke the Lord is my sheer the Lord is my sheer I shall not want he leadth me he's walking with me imagine those times when you don't have a coin in your pocket if you don't have a coin in your pocket at dvf we don't always talk about money but sometimes we do and this is one of those moments when you are poor when you are empty you're looking as at me as if you have never gone through that situation some of you may be going through it right now when it is very difficult when you don't have anywhere to run Jesus is telling you this morning come walk with me praise God hallelujah when when when thieves have come and stolen away something from you when the devil has come and taken away your joy you know when sickness has come and creeped your life you know when when Sorrows have come and swept over your soul when Temptations around you and trials beat and [Music] and you feel you have nowhere to run let me tell you if you have Jesus you are working with him amen you are going to be able to say the Lord is my shepherd and he says come walk with me let's take a moment to talk about a Shepherd who is a Shepherd John 10: 11 it say say I am the Good Shepherd you could open brother and read out of out of the Bible it says I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep but he that is unhearing and not the shepherd whose own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catches them and scattereth the Sheep the hearing fleeth because he is an hearing and carth not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and I'm known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and lay down my life for the [Music] Sheep [Music] all right so now he says I'm the Good Shepherd that give my life for the sheep and he give an example he gives an example of an hiring he said he not a Shepherd you know let me tell you if you have a God the Bible says if the Lord does not keep the city they that keep keep in vain they watch in vain because why let me tell you if a thief came and and a God knew that his life may be at risk he may just take off and he will run away but if the owner of the home knowing that his children are here knowing that everything he has made is here he will die trying to save his family we are not just a friend of Jesus Jesus is not just our friend Jesus Is Our Shepherd Jesus is our family we are his family we are a part of him he is a part of us he is not willing to lose us at any time he's willing to give himself for us why because he's our Shepherd can you say Jesus is my shepherd amen he laid down his life for the Sheep because he knew the way down here not easy it is not easy to go through life's journey I cannot let them walk alone I cannot let you walk alone come walk with me the way may be sorrowful the way may be straight and narrow with me we need to realize friends no matter where the the the the the Winds of Life blows us the Temptations of of this life the lust of the world the pride of life the things that keep pulling on us the sorrow of life appointments I've seen people who were once heartbroken and disappointed that they themselves became AR W completely nothing they become useless because they don't have anyone if they trusted somebody so much and this person gives them up you know dumps them I am one of those My Father I remember was in in P when my father you know sat down with us I grew up watching my father as a preacher watching him preach to the people people getting saved and then in the evening time of his life you know he gets entangled with things of life he got entangled with things of Life cares of life and he back and then you know things began to change swiftly we sat around that table I remember that clearly which class are you in brother P5 I was almost his age you know come here brother I wanted to watch this age this young boy here has a whole life ahead of you but our generation is having many of them heartbroken disappointed about life where you cannot prove to them that there is a hope that things will be better and I was his age and my father said I've taken all of you to school and I was the fourth born he said from from today I'm I wherever you have stopped is where you would I thought about that in my young head I couldn't understand and then later on he left home and we were left alone with our mother who did not almost have anything all she had was relatives who had some money she worked hard that's why mothers you should work hard for your family to stand behind your husbands and to stand behind your your family to walk with them all through there is nothing like a good mother who will walk with his children no matter what no matter what life brings their way we will walk with them my mother walked with us sometimes she would come at school and you know you know you know go and her whatever and then pull out some money and and would give it to you and said now this is my transport this is your money you can use it and she's giving you maybe 20,000 or 10,000 and she's remaining with 10,000 I would look at those things it would touch my heart because at that moment I had someone that would walk with me but I'm telling you in life you have a lot of people who are heartbroken a lot of people who are heartbroken and by the way for that I'm preaching it is Sunday morning but I want to appreciate you mother you walked with me you really walked with me praise God praise God she was young she could have gotten married again I think she was 35 or something like that but she decided not to marry again but take care to walk with her children praise God God bless you mothers who have walked with your Hallelujah there's nothing good like a mother who will stand behind children stand behind a husband stand behind a home and this is my place I am not going to allow any demons to come and destroy my children I'm going to pray for them I'm going to do everything I can to walk with them through this life journey and our generation is heartbroken many young children are heartbroken many of them have turned to drugs many of them have turned to many things to immorality not because they desire but because the people they trusted the people they looked up to forsook them left them alone and so they had no hope and what did they decide to do they decided to walk alone in this dark LLY word and even as I'm preaching to you this morning I didn't plan to preach on this but yesterday you know I Heard a Voice I didn't know what was going to preach about and he spoke to me come walk with me I knew right there that's what God was telling me to speak about this morning and there must be somebody that needed this this morning if you are listening to me and maybe you been that kind of person that you feel you can't trust nobody have faith in nobody you feel you are all alone you feel you are all forsaken you feel life has e you down you have no hope amen there is someone here saying this morning come walk with me come walk with me I am so glad that Jesus he's the shepherd amen he's always going to walk with us praise God he says I'm the I'm the Good Shepherd many people would even say have nothing to inherit I have I I feel you I'm one of them to inherit I have nothing to look up to no money that you know was passed on to me completely let me tell you if you are in that situation you a strong man or a strong woman because God wants to walk with you you may be a woman and you were forsaken by your husband and you were left all alone to figure your way through life but I'm here this morning to tell you Jesus is saying come walk with me come walk with me I am a good shepherd and I'm going to give my life for my sheep I am not a hiring no amen he says the hiring fleeth because he's uniring and he does not care for the ship I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and I am none of mine oh praise God and he said I lay down my life for the shame this is somebody that can never forsake me by the way if we if it comes down to our address and we realize we are talking about someone who is reliable we are talking about someone you can count on if you have never gone through any distress in life the suon this morning is not for you but if you've gone through those moments then God is speaking to you this morning amen because Jesus is reliable he can never forsake his subject because we are not just his subjects we are his children we are his family he will do everything and anything to save us he came down from glory and he gave his life for his family and he says come walk with me but the problem is many do not want to come Jesus is the shepherd he laid down his life for the Sheep we are the Sheep of his flock do we know him do you know him he says we know him and he he knows us Christ Alone he was crucified for us not a man not some organization you find very many people they listen to their Earthly Shepherds instead of The Shepherd of our souls but Jesus is The Shepherd of our soul he can never forsake us amen he he gave his life very life that we might have life more abundantly and even when life becomes difficult he's always there with us in First Corinthians chapter 1 verse2 he says now this I say that every one of you sayth I am of Paul I am of appos and I ofas is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you oh you baptized in the name of Paul and I thank God that I baptized none of you chispas and gas L any should say that I had baptized in my own name so who was crucified for us Christ was crucified for us with canot walk with any other name even water baptism he says come walk with me Hallelujah we we can follow anybody as long as they following Christ but if somebody tells us to follow them when they're not walking with Christ then that is a hiring and they will mislead you but Jesus Christ can never mislead you he can never mislead his own Paul here says some say that I am of Paul I am of even in the message church is coming where people begin to follow pastors let let me say something here you see we we used to have churches Pentecostal churches making sign posts and you know on their sign post they put their picture and their names just like I I put days of the voice Fellowship fellowship and I put my wife there and myself Bop what is and then people are coming to our church because they're following us and you can say anything you want to say these people are really followers of these men you will tell them anything they tell you but Papa said something as long as he said something else they don't care what the Bible says but in the message this message which we what we call the end message that is not the case for us we have one Shepherd that is Jesus Christ is the shepherd to our souls he is the one we are following we are going to follow any man as long as he's leading us to that sh you know even Paul himself in the book of 1 Corinthians 11 he said be ye followers of me even as I also I am of Christ so in other words if I I don't follow Christ don't follow me and if I follow Christ then follow me brother bam one time he said if I said anything that is not in the Bible leave it alone amen why do we brother why do we quot his messages why do we believe him as El of the end time because everything William Bram preached every do every teaching been pointing us back to our shepher back to the Bible back to Jesus Christ I do not know any religion in the world or any religious movement in points people to Christ than this message this message does not point us to a [Applause] system you know some people they go around the world and and they preach they go two by two that those people who dress always they dress properly and they will always lead you to their organization you know they will always lead to their Church they will always lead you to their man of God the enter message listen not meant to point us to William Bram are you following me it's not meant to point us toam or your P or some great man this message has one purpose to point us to The Shepherd of our soul Jesus Christ who gave his life for us Paul the first church age messenger he said I have heard from among you for us we are for us no no no no for us we are following for us we are owned by by by Paul for us we are of Christ he say what are you talking about is Christ divided I ask you a question is Christ divided Christ is one so what Christ are the denominations projecting and you even find certain times people will only go to one group they will never go to any other even when they have an opportunity and I'm not talking outside I'm talking about inside are you following me I'm speaking some very important things this morning you find that somebody like brother goes to but because he from Days of the voice Fellowship brother he cannot attend church there he cannot why because he's not a member there because for him he supposed to follow because that is the right one is the only right one the only one is following that's what Apostle Paul is he saying did die for you did Paul die for you did die for you look we have one Shepherd and that is the one who bled and died that's the only one we are following and any man amen that is leading us to that oh we want to follow that one we want to follow that person to the extent that sometimes say that if you are in a place very far and there's no good Bible teaching Church full there's no full there's no Full Gospel Church you see find a place to Fellowship don't stay at home are you following me don't stay at home find if if the Catholic church is the only place go there if the angan church is the only chch Miracle Center is the only go there but don't stay at home because you have no transport to go to church now thank God we have streaming you have no transport you can stream but if you can't stream and you can't go to church find any worship center near you and go there and eat some food that you can find of course if they serve you food with a lot of Bones you can throw away the bones and eat the food that they have given the that is what we believe we don't believe in believer state at home we are not even that follows a man or religious organization or church system no we are following Christ and wherever the word is Christ is there whenever Christ is preached the word is there are you following me now we believe you don't you don't just go to the church near you you you got to a church where you will find food for your soul you go to a place where you will find the pastor or the shepherd following Christ like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ but these days do you know how it is I will show you brother brothers come here I show you something here come come here my brother this brother last last Sunday made him stand for almost one hour God bless you you really did good amen okay now now here I am this is Jesus Christ and this one is not so now the pastors they're very busy pointing people to somebody else and the people are very busy blindly following they following when the blind Le the blind fall fall into the dit but what should we do we should follow a man who is pointing us to the right dire the right direction what the right direction Christ word Christ the moment it deviates what do we do we keep following we keep following after all he's our pastor he's our Bishop what do we do well he knows better and the man is Anointed even if is even if he not exactly but it's okay you are going to fall into the ditch with him praise God follow him as he follows Christ God bless you brother follow him as he follows Christ and I thank God for this message of the hour because the endent message does not point us to any other place points us to Christ the Bible says in 1 Peter 2:25 for you were sheep as you were she as sheep going asay but I now return and to the shepherd and Bishop of your soul Hallelujah Jesus is The Shepherd of our soul Jesus is my Bishop Say it With Me Jesus is my Bishop Hallelujah he's my Bishop he's my sheer my Bishop David said Hallelujah in those words of Faith the Lord is my sheer I also say Jesus is my shepher remember Jesus is Lord if Jesus is Lord I want to say the Lord is my shepher Jesus is my shepherd that means he leads me he guides me we don't go to a church because of their name because they called Full Gospel because they called Deliverance because heaven come down power Ministry those are just names we go to a place to Fellowship because our Shepherd is there and Our Shepherd is glorified Our Shepherd is lifted up we are living in a generation where churches are lifting somebody where churches have left the bishop of our soul and the pastors they have taken the place of our Bishop they have got this what you would call Blasphemous names you see they have taken the place of Jesus even to call a man of God even to call a man of God brother oh my God you have committed a crime how can you do that I wonder one I was a certain airport and I think maybe in Legos and then this man was a Nigerian and I told him what's your name by the time he finished I was so tired because he spoke his name for about one minute I am apost overseer blah blah blah blah blah blah I don't even remember his name but by the time he spoke his Nam he had all these big huge titles but we said when I said let's go to the word I'm sorry to use these words but I will use them he was as empty as a te no word so who made you an apostle who made you a doctor who made you a bishop who made you an Arch Bishop overseer overseer for what are you following me but who is our overseer who is our Bishop Jesus is our Bishop Jesus is our pastor he's our Shepherd he she of our soul we are 100% convinced he can never forsake us no matter what we have gone through in our life he's always going to be there for us never leave us he can never forsake us hallelujah hallelujah do you believe that church praise God so if we follow the road map it says turn on highway so and so here says turn that way if acts 238 said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins it did not turn left then you must stand that way I don't care how it is you've got to follow the road if he say the promises to you and your children that didn't mean for an age p as many as the Lord Our God shall call is what it said that is God's road map we must follow that road map the road is already marked out right it's already marked out I'm quoting words here brother B says the blood Footprints of the Lord Jesus made the road and the disciples Le on that same [Music] Foundation I am so glad I am walking on this road M the road map has already been made for us where is it we can see it by the prince on the amen the bloody footprints whenever you see the blood follow that Trail Follow that trail we in this dark lonely world but let me tell you you can walk with Jesus if you walk with Jesus you are sure of reaching the end the Bible says he will give us unexpected follow the road what is the m the Holy Bible Acts 238 if it says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins what is that it is the road map you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and your sins will be washed away and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is that is a road map but other Shepherds that are hirings they came and they snatched away people from those Pathways they told them you don't need to walk there there is no hope there you see we have been preaching for very many years before you are born what are you talking about just come and walk here they will tell them turn left yet the be saying continue straight and the preachers told them left is saying what no you can be baptized father is also it works like we don't want things that are going to work like we wanton we want the real thing are you hearing me so if if it doesn't say turn left if it doesn't say that you have to go straight but they turn left they bapti babies they a child like this one like this one you know I don't know how old he she is and they take her and they begin asking her do you accept to repent all your sins doesn't understand nothing and then they take water they say who is the god father comes does anybody know what a God yes does anybody know who knows God fathers all of you areis god father do you know what okay so do you accept to rec all the world the pleasures of the world and everything in the world follow Jesus yes I believe do you see that laughing but it's done in theur while it is done people say that is uning they're being deceived there is deception here someone should tell them and I'm here as a voice I'm just one of the lead of the voices I'm just one of the voices but I'm here to tell them that decep this child how can you answer for the child who gave you that Authority who told you you can do that it is the hiring Shepherd the ons who don't have the mandate to be a shepher what do we do take the child away from that system to begin number two once you take the child away from that system you turn away from that kind of preacher you turn away from that kind of preacher he's not a good shepherd and then you go to a Shepherd who is the shepherd not me not my church the shepherd is Jesus Christ the hallelujah hallelujah people can't understand God wants to be his own president for his own people he wants to preside over his church he wants to be the bishop of the church even the Arch Bishop of the church not a system or man but man has always desired to find somebody to to lead them when God was presiding over Israel Israel reached a moment they said no we want to have Bishops and Kings like others said do you know what they talking about do you know what they will do to you what are they doing to them now they're making them eat grass they're making them eat drink petrol all in the name of Jesus and miracles but why because they rejected the bishop of their souls that is Jesus Christ the word are you following me his blood Footprints are on the road and the disciples laid on that same Foundation can you see those blood Footprints baptism in Jesus name Faith in one God the Rapture and all these things that are in the Bible those are the blood Footprints of Jesus Christ wherever he put his feet put your feet brother wherever he put his feet put your feet brother the journey may seem too long it may seem too tiresome but let me assure you if you continue following the path one of these days hallelujah sister Ruth one of these days we are going to overcome we are going to be raptured out of here out of this dead systems of man into the kingdom of God praise God come walk with me he says and I come back to the thought but quick now my time is running let us look ATK Mark 8 8:34 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me this is important now forever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's sake the same shall save itet a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul [Music] what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adult and sinful generation h of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels how many want to walk with Jesus he says come walk with me but he says if you are going to walk with me there is a cost there is a price also to he says you have to be ready to deny yourself and take up your cross and follow him whoever will save his life whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel sake will save it I'm so glad that 17 years ago I made up a big decision in my life I have never regretted up to I decided to take up my cross and follow Jesus Christ no matter what life BR no matter what life took away I have never decided again to leave him I decided to give him my life we have very many filters in the world today filters fils and people look at life through many filters you can decide to look at life through the future of Education you can decide to look at at life through the field of secularism you can start to look at life through many ways but here he's talking about looking at life through the filter of the work accepting to deny yourself you have to understand this is why they call fools because you look and at things the way others don't look at [Music] it you know Fe was telling me here the other day the teachers at school very serious on her why can't you do makeup what is wrong with you they can't understand but if she decid to look at the at the word through the field of the word sister people can't understand why you can't do makeup people won't understand why you cannot wear trousers sisters amen people will not understand that why you have thrown your earrings away because you have decided to deny yourself you have decided to die to the way people look at things and you decided to look at it a different way CH was telling me the other day that at school their school is almost a crime not to have a girlfriend or a boyfriend Hallelujah did you get a girlfriend finally praise God did he answer okay Hallelujah it is almost a crime no no no no no it's not acceptable it's almost a crime in this generation to be in University to be a teenager and you don't have a girlfriend let me tell you Jesus said he that shall gain his life shall lose it and he that shall lose his life shall gain it Hallelujah you must decide to lose it all for the cause of the gospel for the cause of the word when others see it a different way your is a different way they can't understand they can't understand you because they did not understand him when he was on Earth they did not know who he was they did not understand why he did things way he did they thought his kingdom was here and he told them my kingdom is not of this world my kingdom is of I want to tell you Church our kingdom is not of this world if you want to walk with Jesus you cannot walk with the world at the same time listen to me young man you have to throw away those girlfriends you cannot walk with Jesus and your girlfriend you are making a big mistake it cannot happen you have to decide to die to yourself sister same thing oh Pastor what are you talking about are you telling us we should not have girlfriends boyfriend how are we then going to get married well according to scripture marri doesn't come from immorality are you following me marriage comes from God who gives a wife God gives a wife and even the Bible tells me God wants you to be happy with the wife of your youth brother and the moment you get married like the sky is the [Music] limit if you decide to take a vacation if you decide to live on Mars or to go on the moon and you stay there decision be happy with a wife of your youth have young people here but there are more more us there the Bible believes in a boy being happy with a girl in the right way the right way is when God gives you a wife where did Adam get his wife the Bible doesn't say Adam began demonstrating no not good I'm not happy now how can you do this everything is to only one my body my body my Adam was patient Adam was in the presence of God Adam waited for the will of godam did not go in immorality Adam waited for God to say it is not good for Adam to be alone and when God said that then God gave adam a wife the Bible says he that gets a wife has got favor from the Lord you see it is favor from the Lord when I say fav don't all of you go running to favor all I'm saying favor you get favor from the Lord when God gives when God gives your wife praise God oh my God Brother Martin you are favored brother fav brother fav come on anybody who has a wife here you favored let me tell you you should love your wies love them if the world out there you find them doing all sorts of things you who has your own show the world how it is done treat her like a princess show the wife that a wife is a precious thing Hollywood has taken a woman and uses a word which many people think is VG Hollywood has actually turned a woman into a sex G is what Hollywood has made a woman a woman is the most precious thing on earth after salvation when God gives you up a woman it means god trusts you so if you don't have a wife and you want one it means you have not earned the trust of God yet it means you should pray more and get God his trust so he can bring his daughter and give her and when you get a daughter of God and you treat her like your like your rug you have a very big problem brother B would say wife a good wife a wife is the next best thing to Salvation after salvation the second best thing can ever given is aous wife I can stand here today and testify God has given one of those to me yes for the past 11 years I've been having a wonderful time Hallelujah that scripture a wonderful time with a wife of your youth raising a family together does it mean you never have disagreements you will disagree many times but yet love is stronger love covers a multitude of sins and if you are if you're married and your family has had issues I have a message for you the Bible says like we have seen here David said even though I walk through the valley of the sh I will fear no evil the Lord is my shepherd walk with the Lord come walk with the Lord if you walk with the Lord he will make all things beautiful hallelujah hallelujah just keep trusting him just keep walking with him praise the name of the Lord but our younger generation must understand that you have to lose yourself in order to gain yourself you have to deny yourself in order to become to walk with the Lord praise God praise God what I what what shall a man gain what shall a man profit rather if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul what shall a man give for your soul what shall you give in for your soul see people have taken their souls and theyed it a whole lot of things in the world sful things oh God have mercy what shall a man give next for his you have One Life to Live and he says whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation I also be ashamed how many young people here and older ones alike that will say I am not going to be ashamed of Christ of the word of God you young people that are in school don't be ashamed to say I don't have a girlfriend I don't have a boyfriend I don't dress this way I don't talk that way I don't do kind of things or let's go to a party what kind of party I'm sorry I don't go to those don't be ashamed stand for the word I said don't be ashamed stand for the word and God will stand with you that's what Believers believe Matthew 19 16 and behold one one one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is not no one good but one that is God but if thou Willl enter into life keep the Commandments and he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt not murder thou sh not Comm Thou shalt not steal thou sh not beon thy father and mother and thou sh Love Thy Neighbor un th the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth what like I yet Jesus said unto him thou will be perfect go sell everything you have give it to the poor and I shall have treasure in and come and follow me praise God praise God I want us to look at two things here number one Jesus Is a Good Shepherd when he came to this young man and this young man etal life we have already seen that you have to deny yourself Lose Yourself so you can gain him but now here he's telling Jesus that uh uh what should I do please follow me here now and Jesus said go and do the Commandments okay the young man said I've done all this Commandments ever since I was a child I've done all of them Jesus now said if you want to be perfect there is one thing that you should how many want to be perfect I want to be perfect and here is one thing we should do sell everything oh my God all your possessions that means things of value in your heart in your mind sell it all after you've sold it don't bring it to Jesus now you see what a Shepherd does the shepherds today what do they say now go sell everything bring the money to the ministry the work of God and God I will pray God will shake a bless Heavens will be open for and you be blessed but that is a hearing but a real Shepherd wasn't interested in their Treasures God is not interested in your Treasures now he is not saying we should be poor he's not talking about money here he is talking about anything that you value more than Christ anything that will stand between you and the word what is for you you know it sell it away Give It Away accept to lose it accept to lose them I can tell it to you but I can't do it for you inside your deep you have to make a choice and I've given out I've given them out it is not easy thing that we are so precious doing the you love the ones you are appreci I didn't every time you go to the disc and you dance you feel good but lose that sell them them out that is what you have to do anybody who wants

all your heart your body and everything you are you must you can't walk with Jesus when you're holding on to worldly things also Jesus you there in the middle you are like a we you understand me you love Jesus you also love the world you are there the world oh as long as I'm not holding it but it is the world pulling me me I'm holding Jesus you are lying to yourself you know it very well you have to make a choice to leave it World pull me pull me world world is pulling me I want Jesus I want Jesus but the world is pulling me I would want to leave the world has refus you lying to yourself the Bible says accept to S tell Jesus now let me fight this batt you world from forth I've done a choice now leave me alone go back go go go now Jesus come we are going to walk together that decision can be made by anyone let me tell you if you want to be on fire for God you can be fire for God no man should tell you that you have to do this and that you just make a decision a decision a choice the problem is that church is very hard for very many the younger man came to Jesus but the world was with him and Jesus told him sell everything sell everything give it to the poor come follow me young man said I want Jesus it means to give up everything i' rather him but he went away s in his his heart was empty with that void emptiness because you had not surrendered to Jesus be not dece no man has ever heard the word and the same whether they believed it or not the word impacts their life to Salvation or to condemnation I want to be one of those that will be saved because of the word hallelujah Hallelujah and this man I want to find now it is 1: p.m. I want to reach a place to close and the young man kept you know he finally went away sorrowful in his heart but Jesus wanted to walk with him Jesus Is Here Wanting to do the same thing in order to get eternal life Christ Jesus wanted to walk with him no amount of our Deeds of righteousness will give us eternal life we need to walk with him so he can mold his own character in us while we are walking in this journey Hallelujah hallelu Jesus told this man come walk with me come walk with me and this invitation is still here today he's still calling to do come walk with me come walk with me now while you are walking with me things begin to change we are all changing we a work in progress he's still changing us but first the decision has to be made to walk with him and then while you walk you realize you limping and then you tell him Jesus I'm leaping he would say yes he will touch your say you can now walk say continue walking and then you'll be fine and then you realize your backs and then he will tell you it's all right my son you touch your back and then you you will walk straight that's the benefits of Walking With Jesus you can never be a loser if you walk with Jesus he says come walk with me hallelujah hallelujah praise God remember Jesus said follow me follow me get rid of what you got and follow me and that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he gave this man was the only remedy he give this businessman the only remedy he gives any body his choice he makes his decision perfect every time and we must follow him is the only way to have eternal life the leadership of God is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost so we have that invitation here today praise God I don't know how many would like to follow I don't know how many would like to walk with him I'd like us to stand as I read this quot to you it says if you could just know that that same thing that our great leader the Holy Spirit God has sent him and he's our leader and no matter what the world says how much they laugh at you and make fun of you I want to say we follow our leader God sent the Holy Spirit to be our leader and this leader will never take us from the past he will keep us right in the path of the scripture all the time but he will never go to one side for something this site for something he will stay right straight in the road of that's why we love the word and the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit when you receive the spirit of Truth what he does he leads you into the ways of the world and David knew that and that's why he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leth me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me would you just close your eyes for a moment with me I'd like to talk about your value of the shadow of death you may have walked alone for a long time and you can't seem to get through oh I want to tell you there is somebody that is telling you today come walk with me you may have gone through a lot of loss a lot of pain a lot of heartbreaks but he's telling you today come walk with me I'm the shepherd of your souls I am not going to forsake you I died for you I gave myself my life for you that you may have life and more abundant wants to help you he wants to lead you through oh about those things maybe somebody has been walking alone today and you want to sell everything and give yourself to him that you may walk with him light of his word I want to give you that opportunity while we sing this
