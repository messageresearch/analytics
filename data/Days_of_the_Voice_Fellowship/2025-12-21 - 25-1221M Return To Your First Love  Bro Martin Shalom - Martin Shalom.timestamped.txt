[1:33:40] Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Just pray for me.
[1:33:45] And the Lord will uh speak to you this
[1:33:48] morning.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] And where we have read here,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; uh, Matthew is telling us something
[1:34:01] in Matthew 24.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; If you read, uh, there is several
[1:34:06] warning in the scripture.
[1:34:10] Amen.
[1:34:13] The Bible says in vers three
[1:34:16] that and as he sat upon the mount of
[1:34:19] olive, the disciple came unto him
[1:34:21] privately saying that tell us when shall
[1:34:24] uh these things be and what shall be the
[1:34:27] sign of the coming and of the end of the
[1:34:30] world.
[1:34:49] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:34:51] "Take heed that no man deceive you."
[1:34:59] For many shall come in my name, saying,
[1:35:01] I am Christ, and shall deceive many.
[1:35:09] And you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:35:11] wars, and see that you be not troubled,
[1:35:14] for all things must come to pass, but
[1:35:16] the end is not yet.
[1:35:28] For nation shall rise against nation and
[1:35:30] kingdom against kingdom. And there shall
[1:35:32] be famine and pestilence and earthquake
[1:35:35] in diverse places.
[1:35:44] And all these are the beginning of
[1:35:47] sorrows.
[1:35:52] Then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:35:54] afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye
[1:35:56] shall be hated of all nation for my
[1:35:58] name's sake.
[1:36:00] And then shall many be offended, and
[1:36:02] shall betray one another, and shall hate
[1:36:04] one another. And many false prophets
[1:36:06] shall arise, and shall deceive many. And
[1:36:09] because iniquity shall abound, the love
[1:36:12] of many shall works cold.
[1:36:44] Praise be to God. We are seeing the
[1:36:46] disciples here.
[1:36:49] They were concerned
[1:36:52] and they wanted to know the signs of the
[1:36:54] coming of the Lord.
[1:36:58] Praise be to God. And we have read in
[1:37:00] this scripture.
[1:37:02] Very the Lord speaking about many things
[1:37:06] how nation rise against nation,
[1:37:09] kingdom against kingdom.
[1:37:12] He talks of earthquaking, diverse,
[1:37:16] wars and rumors of wars.
[1:37:20] Praise be TO GOD. BUT HERE IT tells us
[1:37:24] that when we see all these things,
[1:37:27] it is just the beginning of sorrow.
[1:37:32] The end is yet is not yet.
[1:37:36] Praise be to God.
[1:37:39] Amen. We believe, how many believes that
[1:37:41] we're in the end time?
[1:37:44] Yes, we are living in the end time
[1:37:47] and we are seeing these very things
[1:37:48] going on.
[1:37:51] BUT JESUS TOLD US WHEN HE HEARS OF WARS
[1:37:55] and rumors of wars and perplexity in
[1:37:58] nature.
[1:38:00] Amen. Talk of the earthquakes, the
[1:38:03] tornados,
[1:38:06] the typhoons and ALL THOSE THINGS.
[1:38:09] YOU SAY that when you SEE THOSE THINGS
[1:38:13] IS JUST the beginning of sorrow.
[1:38:17] The end is not yet.
[1:38:20] Nation rise AGAINST NATION,
[1:38:23] kingdom against kingdom.
[1:38:26] Praise be to God.
[1:38:28] Amen. And many times those are the
[1:38:32] things we are looking at
[1:38:39] only those are the signs of the end.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; AND WE THINK THAT THOSE are the
[1:38:45] in 12.
[1:38:48] Amen. It says, "Because iniquity shall
[1:38:52] abound,
[1:38:57] the love of men shall work.
[1:39:02] BUT HE THAT SHALL ENDURE unto the end,
[1:39:07] the same shall be saved."
[1:39:11] Praise be to God.
[1:39:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE INIQUITY SHALL ABOUND
[1:39:20] WE LIVING IN THE TIME I believe it's
[1:39:22] like the time OF JOB
[1:39:25] BECAUSE SOMEWHERE IN JOB SAY
[1:39:28] that I made covenant with my EYES
[1:39:32] not to see EVIL THINGS.
[1:39:35] I THINK DURING JOB'S DAYS
[1:39:38] IT was terrible.
[1:39:40] PRAISE BE TO GOD. BUT WE are the people
[1:39:44] who HAVE COME TO THE END OF THE WORLD.
[1:39:47] WE HAVE SEEN THE END of the world.
[1:39:51] Praise be to God. WE ARE SEEING THE
[1:39:53] FALSE PROPHET.
[1:39:55] THEY'RE RISING EVERY DAY
[1:39:58] GIVING FALSE PROPHECY.
[1:40:00] PRAISE BE TO GOD. We are the people
[1:40:02] living IN THE TIME WHERE WE HAVE
[1:40:05] PROPHETS
[1:40:07] who sees when it's going to rain.
[1:40:10] THEY FIRST SEE THE CLOUDS
[1:40:13] AND THEY PROPHESY.
[1:40:15] THUS SAYS THE LORD. It's going to rain.
[1:40:18] And then it failed to rain.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; False prophets.
[1:40:32] They're all over the uh the social
[1:40:34] media.
[1:40:36] THEY ARE DOING THINGS THAT you can't
[1:40:38] even imagine.
[1:40:42] Praise be TO GOD.
[1:40:45] THEY ARE MAKING MERCHANDISE OUT OF
[1:40:47] PEOPLE.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; There is one I saw and this was this one
[1:40:54] was kicking women this year
[1:40:58] prophets.
[1:41:00] The Bible wonders.
[1:41:03] Praise be to God. Amen. But we KNOW THAT
[1:41:06] AMIDST ALL THIS CONFUSION,
[1:41:10] there is A VOICE OF GOD.
[1:41:13] AMEN. WHEN GOD SENT MOSES TO EGYPT,
[1:41:17] MOSES HAD THUS SAYS THE LORD.
[1:41:20] THAT'S WHAT MADE DIFFERENCE.
[1:41:23] HE MET GOD IN THE BURNING BUSH. GOD
[1:41:26] COMMISSIONED HIM TO GO WITH A MESSAGE OF
[1:41:30] LIBERATION, liberate nation of Israel.
[1:41:34] Praise be to God. BUT EVEN IN EGYPT
[1:41:36] ALSO, THEY ALSO HAD PROPHETS.
[1:41:43] AND THEIR STICK OR THEIR STAFF
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; ALSO HAD VOICE BEHIND
[1:41:53] behind Moses's stuff.
[1:41:56] IT HAD A MESSAGE. LET MY PEOPLE go
[1:42:02] behind false prophet STUFF
[1:42:08] ALSO. [screaming] YOU ARE GOING NOWHERE.
[1:42:13] Praise be to God.
[1:42:15] Amen. But this morning, I want to talk
[1:42:20] about return to your first life.
[1:42:24] We can talk about this until Jesus
[1:42:26] comes.
[1:42:29] Amen. All of us, we know what love is.
[1:42:35] Praise be to God. AND ALL OF US HAVE
[1:42:38] DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION of love.
[1:42:43] But by the eye of the prophet,
[1:42:46] the message OF THE HOUR, HERE comes a
[1:42:49] prophet and gives us definition of LOVE
[1:42:54] AND THE types of love
[1:42:57] and tells us there IS A LOVE
[1:43:00] and love.
[1:43:03] IT tells us the love of agap
[1:43:06] is GODLY LOVE
[1:43:09] THAT WHICH IS UNCONDITION.
[1:43:12] Praise be to God.
[1:43:15] Amen.
[1:43:17] And then after those the ages
[1:43:26] praise be to God. BUT THE LOVE I'M
[1:43:29] talking about this morning
[1:43:31] is the love of God.
[1:43:33] RETURNING TO THAT FIRST LOVE YOU HAD.
[1:43:38] AMEN. And I can refer THAT LOVE
[1:43:42] YOU HAD WHEN you had just believed.
[1:43:46] THAT FERVENT DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD.
[1:43:52] And in church ages, WE ARE SEEING GOD
[1:43:55] REBUKING the church of Ephesus,
[1:43:58] telling them to return TO THE FIRST
[1:44:00] LAND.
[1:44:03] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:44:05] AMEN.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Let's read this scripture in Revelation
[1:44:13] chapter. I I believe it's chapter 2.
[1:44:20] Uh
[1:44:24] yeah, we're reading from chapter 2 to
[1:44:28] chapter 2 verse one to uh vers six.
[1:44:34] It says, "Unto the angel of the church
[1:44:35] of Ephesus, write these things, says he
[1:44:39] that hold the seven star in his right
[1:44:41] hand, who walketh in the midst of the
[1:44:43] seven golden candlestick. I know thy
[1:44:46] works, and thy labor, and thy patience,
[1:44:49] and how thou cannot bear them which are
[1:44:52] evil, and thou hast tried them which say
[1:44:57] they are apostle and are not, and has
[1:45:00] found them liars,
[1:45:03] and has borne, and has patience. And for
[1:45:07] my name's sake thou labored, and has not
[1:45:10] fainted.
[1:45:12] Nevertheless, I have somewhat AGAINST
[1:45:15] THEE, BECAUSE THOU HAS LOVED THY FIRST
[1:45:18] LOVE. This is what I'm talking about
[1:45:20] here.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Remember there are far FROM WHEN THOU
[1:45:26] HAVE FALLEN and repent and do the works,
[1:45:30] or else I will come unto thee quickly,
[1:45:34] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[1:45:36] uh his place, except thou repent. And
[1:45:41] this thou hast that thou hastest the
[1:45:44] deed of Nicolatans which I also had.
[1:45:48] Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; And in this scripture,
[1:45:56] God is speaking to the church of Ephesus
[1:46:00] AND IS RECOGNIZING HOW they are patient,
[1:46:05] how they never bear those who are evil.
[1:46:09] BUT HE TOLD THEM
[1:46:11] TO return to their fast.
[1:46:16] One time uh I remember I preached a
[1:46:19] sermon
[1:46:21] drifting without knowing.
[1:46:27] Praise be to God. Yeah, YOU CAN DRIFT
[1:46:32] WITHOUT realizing that you've been
[1:46:33] drifting
[1:46:37] because remember BACKSLIDING
[1:46:40] DOES NOT JUST HAPPEN at once.
[1:46:43] No, it is gradual.
[1:46:47] Praise be TO GOD. WHEN THE DEVIL COMES
[1:46:50] TO YOU, HE DOES NOT JUST COME AND KNOCK
[1:46:52] YOU.
[1:46:54] HE MUST COME with a bait.
[1:47:07] Praise be to God.
[1:47:09] Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; This very week I was talking to one of
[1:47:13] my sister's daughters.
[1:47:17] They were telling me that giving me
[1:47:19] description of Satan
[1:47:23] how he has ready eyes with horns with
[1:47:26] long teeth.
[1:47:29] And I told them no that's not true.
[1:47:34] I TOLD THEM THE DEVIL is one of the most
[1:47:39] beautiful creature.
[1:47:45] So we went to the scripture
[1:47:48] and we read about Lucifer
[1:47:51] how he was beautiful
[1:47:54] and they were like what?
[1:47:58] Praise be to God.
[1:48:01] Then I told them if the DEVIL WAS UGLY,
[1:48:06] NOBODY WOULD have loved the devil.
[1:48:09] But he disguise in beauty
[1:48:13] to entice people.
[1:48:16] Amen. I NEVER STOPPED THERE BECAUSE I
[1:48:19] KNOW THEY LOVE PAINTING THEMSELVES so
[1:48:21] much.
[1:48:23] So I went, we went and read about
[1:48:25] Jezebel
[1:48:27] and the end of Jezebel.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. SO THE devil
[1:48:35] uses beauty.
[1:48:38] He's a HANDSOME GUY.
[1:48:41] HE'S A beautiful guy.
[1:48:44] Praise be to God.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] BECAUSE JUST IMAGINE IF THE GUY COMES
[1:48:50] with a horn
[1:48:52] maybe seven heads like the way the Bible
[1:48:55] describe him that dragon
[1:48:58] seven horns 10
[1:49:03] everybody will run away
[1:49:07] BUT THIS GUY WAS HANDSOME
[1:49:10] AND UP TODAY THIS GUY IS IN BEAUTY
[1:49:15] THAT'S WHY WOMEN ARE IN TROUBLE OH,
[1:49:19] IN THE WORLD THERE THEY PAID THEMSELVES
[1:49:24] UNTIL they go astray themselves.
[1:49:30] DO YOU KNOW YOUR daughter
[1:49:34] like for those in the world NOW
[1:49:37] YOUR DAUGHTER CAN WALK UPON HER SOUL
[1:49:41] AND YOU BYPASS HER WITHOUT KNOWING THAT
[1:49:43] SHE'S YOUR daughter
[1:49:48] that is the generation we are in
[1:49:51] he will put artificial eyeball
[1:49:53] artificial
[1:49:58] teeth,
[1:50:06] artificial nails.
[1:50:10] [laughter]
[1:50:12] She will bypass you unknowingly.
[1:50:15] Praise be to God.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; You find somebody with maybe 60 kg alone
[1:50:28] of maybe the bombs, things like that.
[1:50:40] have undressed them.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; You will see a very very portable girl.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; So now here God is rebuking the EphesS
[1:50:52] church
[1:50:54] and THE CHURCH WHICH CHRIST IS TAKING.
[1:50:59] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS TO RESTORE US
[1:51:03] BACK
[1:51:04] TO THE ORIGINAL CHURCH, ORIGINAL POWER,
[1:51:09] ORIGINAL ANOINTING, ORIGINAL SEAL.
[1:51:14] YES, SIR. WHEN I'M SAVED, THE BRIDE WILL
[1:51:18] WRITE ANOTHER BOOK OF ACTS [screaming]

[1:51:26] AND SHINE,
[1:51:28] HOLINESS and purity.
[1:51:31] YES SIR. PRAISE BE TO GOD. SO THIS
[1:51:34] MESSAGE IS TO TAKE US BACK
[1:51:38] TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH
[1:51:42] and the prophets.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT TO MAKE US
[1:51:49] other creatures,
[1:51:52] not to make us a superman.
[1:51:56] NO SIR, BUT TO RESTORE US BACK
[1:52:00] OUR ORIGINAL STATE.
[1:52:03] blow our MIND
[1:52:06] FOR US TO KNOW BYPASS OUR THEOPHONY
[1:52:13] WHICH HAS BEEN CONNECTING US TO THE
[1:52:18] PRAISE BE TO GOD WHEN WE WERE BORN ON
[1:52:20] EARTH
[1:52:22] WE WERE DISCONNECTED
[1:52:25] from our THEOPHONY
[1:52:28] AND WHEN WE CAME ON EARTH WE LIVE LIKE
[1:52:31] ANY OTHER
[1:52:33] TALK LIKE ANY OTHER PEOPLE,
[1:52:36] BEHAVE LIKE ANY OTHER PEOPLE.
[1:52:39] PRAISE BE TO GOD. I WAS IN A
[1:52:41] PENTECOSTAL,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; but I not KNOW ANY DIFFERENCE
[1:52:47] BETWEEN Catholicism and Pentecostal.
[1:52:52] PRAISE THE LORD. YOU PRAY IN THE NAME OF
[1:52:54] THE FATHER, the son, and the holy.
[1:52:58] You baptize in the same name.
[1:53:00] THEY GIVE YOU BAPTISM CERTIFICATE.
[1:53:06] No difference.
[1:53:10] And we also used to laugh at them.
[1:53:14] We also used to laugh at them.
[1:53:18] We were always they were our cousins.
[1:53:23] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; But when we encounter the message,
[1:53:29] it is the message OF THE HOUR.
[1:53:33] AMEN. WHICH SHOWED US
[1:53:37] THAT WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD,
[1:53:40] THAT WE as good as God,
[1:53:44] LIVE ABOVE SIN.
[1:53:46] CAN BE CHRISTIAN
[1:53:49] AND BE RIGHT HERE, RIGHTEOUS MAN AND
[1:53:52] WOMAN,
[1:53:53] RIGHTEOUS SONS and daughters.
[1:53:57] Praise be to God.
[1:53:59] Amen.
[1:54:01] AMEN. BUT AS TIME GOES ON,
[1:54:05] THIS IS HOW THE DEVIL OPERATES.
[1:54:10] IF one man wakes up today
[1:54:14] and comes up with a go for men
[1:54:20] and says for sisters, I don't know
[1:54:21] whether it is facing this side the

[2:04:17] [screaming]
[2:04:19] FOR THE MANIFESTATION
[2:04:21] OF THE SONS OF GOD. S OF GOD. THEY ARE

[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. A CHILD OF GOD.
[2:06:08] WORSHIP IS IN HIM.
[2:06:12] THE MANUFACTURER OF YOU,
[2:06:15] DESIGNED YOU
[2:06:18] WITH WORSHIP INSIDE YOU,
[2:06:21] PRAY inside you,

[2:06:38] LAST,
[2:06:40] THEY HAVE THE RIGHT LUST,

[2:06:46] BUT THE DEVIL DIVERTED [screaming]
[2:06:50] AND HE SAY THEY GO BOO
[2:06:54] and they think that is their problem.
[2:06:57] AND AFTER THE MOMENT THE DRUNK THE DRINK
[2:07:01] IS OUT OF THEIR MIND,
[2:07:04] THE PROBLEM COMES back
[2:07:07] and you find them crying
[2:07:12] sincerely. What would I do?
[2:07:16] Things have gone astray.

[2:09:38] when you CAN SING AND SAY, "THIS IS THE
[2:09:41] OLD TIME SPIRIT. [screaming]
[2:09:44] THE DEVIL CAN'T GET."

[2:12:51] THE EYE OF GOD.
[2:12:54] THE PROPHET GOES TO GOD. THE WORD OF GOD
[2:12:57] COMES. THE PROPHET
[2:12:59] GIVES THE DIRECTION. [screaming]
[2:13:02] OF GOD
[2:13:04] IS GUIDING US.
[2:13:07] We are not guided by Tik Tok.
[2:13:10] We are not guided by YouTube.
[2:13:12] We're not guided by social media.
[2:13:16] OUR DESIGNER
[2:13:18] [screaming] IS JESUS CHRIST,
[2:13:21] THE WORD.
[2:13:23] AMEN.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:13:28] I'm here to tell you, brothers,
[2:13:31] What are those things that you used to
[2:13:33] do?
[2:13:35] You used to come 30 minutes before the
[2:13:36] service
[2:13:39] and then you come 3 hours.
[2:13:44] You are very comfortable.
[2:13:47] I'm here TO TELL YOU BROTHER
[2:13:50] NEVER LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE.
[2:13:52] [screaming]
[2:13:53] NEVER LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE.
[2:13:57] [screaming]
[2:13:59] The moment YOU LET YOUR CONVICTION DIE,
[2:14:02] YOU ARE GONE.
[2:14:05] AMEN.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REACH A POINT [screaming] WHERE
[2:14:10] YOU STRAY
[2:14:12] AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE
[2:14:15] WHERE YOU SAY PRAYERS
[2:14:18] AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE,
[2:14:20] YOU NO LONGER PRAY, you say.
[2:14:23] [screaming]
[2:14:27] Lord you also know
[2:14:29] by that it's even late
[2:14:31] coming to mid.
[2:14:34] Thank you father
[2:14:36] was full of a lot but tomorrow will be
[2:14:38] better in JESUS NAME.
[2:14:42] ONE man say
[2:14:48] uh I'm forgetting the other word
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; uh leave alone that one it says
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; is something like
[2:15:00] I don't know have something I have time
[2:15:02] Christian can become a full-time devil
[2:15:10] Christian
[2:15:12] cannot overcome a fulltime DEVIL
[2:15:16] BROTHER. LET ME TELL YOU, EVEN WHEN YOU
[2:15:19] DEFEAT THE devil today,
[2:15:24] he just leaves you for A SEASON.
[2:15:28] WHEN JESUS WAS ATTEMPTED BY THE DEVIL,
[2:15:32] THE BIBLE SAYS
[2:15:34] THE DEVIL LEFT JESUS FOR A SEASON.
[2:15:42] HE goes back into the dark gym.
[2:15:47] HE GOES BACK INTO THE SPY INTELLIGENCE
[2:15:49] OF the darkness.
[2:15:52] What can I add? REMEMBER WE IN THE
[2:15:54] BATTLE
[2:15:56] THE STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
[2:15:59] IS IN THE INTELLIGENCE.
[2:16:01] WHEN INTELLIGENCE FAIL DOESN'T MATTER
[2:16:06] HOW HOW LARGE ARMY YOU HAVE.
[2:16:11] PRAISE BE TO GOD. AMERICA HAS CIA
[2:16:15] CIA.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; THEY OPERATE OUTSIDE AMERICAN
[2:16:21] SPYING FOR AMERICA. THEY HAVE THE FBI
[2:16:25] FBI
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; THAT IS there
[2:16:31] among others.
[2:16:34] PRAISE BE TO GOD. WHY
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ARMY?
[2:16:42] So when you have loose intelligence,
[2:16:48] you already defeated me
[2:16:52] and physical things,
[2:16:55] they die, spiritual things.
[2:16:58] We are LIVING THE END TIME
[2:17:01] WITH THE PROPHET TELLS MILLIONS OF
[2:17:04] DEMONS
[2:17:06] ARE RELEASED
[2:17:08] IN THIS GENERATION.
[2:17:11] But believers they there's no
[2:17:19] brother
[2:17:21] is better than you think
[2:17:24] return to YOUR FIRST LOVE.
[2:17:27] JESUS SAID AS WAS IN HIS FIRST COMING
[2:17:33] his second coming
[2:17:35] EVENT
[2:17:37] IN HIS FIRST COMING THE SAME THING IS
[2:17:40] happening now.
[2:17:45] Praise be to God. Be connected to the
[2:17:49] Holy Spirit.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE IF NOT THE COMING OF THE LORD
[2:17:57] HE'S GOING TO FALL ON YOU UNAWARE.
[2:18:02] You will be amongst us. The foolish
[2:18:04] virgin.
[2:18:06] Are you in the church triumphant?
[2:18:09] Are you IN THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT?
[2:18:12] ARE YOU IN THE savior's bride?
[2:18:15] HAVE YOU BEEN BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY?
[2:18:19] Or you are not sure? You can't be you
[2:18:22] cannot be sure for 2 3 4 5 10 years.
[2:18:30] It's impossible. [clears throat]
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord,
[2:18:39] brother.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] You cannot.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; You have to be sure.
[2:18:54] Praise be to God.
[2:18:57] You must be sure.
[2:19:01] And when this thing is preached,
[2:19:05] people think
[2:19:07] there's another way.
[2:19:10] Brother, sister, there's no ANY OTHER
[2:19:12] WAY
[2:19:14] of giving birth.
[2:19:21] There is no other way.
[2:19:26] GIVING BIRTH HAS THE SAME PROCEDURE.
[2:19:30] You can't tell us I want children and
[2:19:34] you don't want to get married
[2:19:37] or you don't want to marry.
[2:19:42] Are you going to kidnap?
[2:19:48] Is that what is in your plan?
[2:19:53] What are you trying to say?
[2:19:55] This is what I'm trying to say.
[2:19:59] UNLESS
[2:20:02] that sit in you
[2:20:06] is quickened by the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:12] You are not even a worshshiper.
[2:20:16] YOU HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED.
[2:20:20] AND YOU ARE comfortable waiting for
[2:20:21] ranch.
[2:20:25] The magnet, the law of magnetism,
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; it only attracts the things
[2:20:34] which has the ELEMENT OF WHICH HAS
[2:20:36] MAGNET
[2:20:42] AND JESUS IS A MEGA MAGNET.
[2:20:46] And when you LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF THE
[2:20:47] RAPTURE,
[2:20:50] THE FINAL STAGE of the RAPTURE
[2:20:53] tells us we are going to meet him in the
[2:20:56] air.
[2:20:59] THERE MUST BE A FORCE IN YOU
[2:21:03] WHICH is going TO VIOLATE THE LAW OF
[2:21:05] GRAVITY. [screaming]
[2:21:09] YES SIR. AND THAT LAW IS CALLED
[2:21:13] THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:21:18] Praise be TO GOD. YOU CANNOT WALK ON
[2:21:21] WATER.
[2:21:23] BUT WHEN YOU'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[2:21:24] GHOST,
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, you can walk on water
[2:21:30] BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS THAT IN THE
[2:21:33] BEGINNING THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED THE
[2:21:38] SURFACE OF THE WATER.
[2:21:42] AND JESUS WHEN HE WAS ON EARTH, HE
[2:21:46] WALKED ON WATER, THE DISCIPLES SAW HIM
[2:21:50] WALKING ON WATER.
[2:21:54] HALLELUJAH. WHEN THEY WERE SCARED AND
[2:21:56] THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GHOST,
[2:22:00] Peter said, "If you are the Lord, be to
[2:22:04] walk."
[2:22:06] IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE JESUS,
[2:22:10] JUDGE ME.
[2:22:12] I ALSO WALK on water.
[2:22:15] Praise be to God. AND JESUS told him,
[2:22:20] "It's okay.
[2:22:22] Come on, brother."
[2:22:25] And the brother enjoy
[2:22:28] the revival was there.
[2:22:32] BUT WHEN WHEN HE MOVED HIS EYES FROM
[2:22:34] JESUS,
[2:22:37] HE started to sing.
[2:22:41] BUT EVEN THOUGH HE SANK
[2:22:44] AND Jesus held his hand,
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; he remained [clears throat]
[2:22:52] a MIGHTY MAN.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; THOUGH I SANK, BUT AT LEAST I WALKED
[2:22:56] some moment.
[2:22:59] [laughter]
[2:23:00] PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT SINKING
[2:23:04] DOESN'T mean I never walked ON WATER.
[2:23:08] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY RIGHTEOUS MAN
[2:23:11] SEVEN TIMES RISE AGAIN. [screaming]
[2:23:16] [applause]
[2:23:18] IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TIME YOU
[2:23:21] HOW MANY TIME YOU ARE BURIED IN SIN.
[2:23:24] ARE YOU WILLING TO GO?
[2:23:27] ARE YOU [screaming] WILLING TO RUN? ARE
[2:23:29] YOU WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD?
[2:23:32] PRAISE BE TO GOD
[2:23:35] IN THE ARMY
[2:23:37] IN THE WAR.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Nobody can say for me they will not even
[2:23:45] give shoot me even a bullet.
[2:23:51] Yes,
[2:23:53] there are nations
[2:23:56] that I will not speak about.
[2:24:00] I think they had that nature of army.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; They can they can
[2:24:12] promote you. Promote you when you have
[2:24:14] never even hit a bullet.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; NOT JESUS.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; He's a RIGHTEOUS JUDGE.
[2:24:26] HE'S A FAIR GOD.
[2:24:28] HAS CHANCES
[2:24:30] TO GIVE US THE SAME BULLET
[2:24:33] OF OF THAT BULLET IS FAITH
[2:24:37] IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
[2:24:39] AMEN. AND HE SEND US TO THE FIELD.
[2:24:43] HE SEND US TO THE BATTLE.
[2:24:47] EVEN WHEN WE ARE BEATEN,
[2:24:49] HE STILL COMES AND GIVES US A HEART.
[2:24:54] PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND THAT'S WHY HE SAY
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO OVERCOMES
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE THAT WILL SIT with me.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:25:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:10] Because iniquity shall abound,
[2:25:14] the love of many will.
[2:25:18] It is sin that drives that dries you up.
[2:25:25] LOSES THAT LIFE OF CHRIST.
[2:25:33] That's why the Bible tells you
[2:25:36] sh from any appearance of evil.
[2:25:42] I always tell the devil is like a
[2:25:44] hawker.
[2:25:47] In fact, the devil is a hawker,
[2:25:50] the advanced one.
[2:25:55] and is a mobile.
[2:25:59] He moves with the LASTATION
[2:26:09] and designs them in a very package.
[2:26:16] He said no this is the last
[2:26:20] they say it's the last
[2:26:24] the pastor will tell you sister I think
[2:26:26] that is your last thing after
[2:26:31] the devil will tell you
[2:26:34] how pastor is really doing you a
[2:26:37] disservice pastor you don't know how I
[2:26:39] feel
[2:26:41] whenever I look at that guy when I just
[2:26:44] think about his
[2:26:46] my heart leaps for joy.
[2:26:51] When I hear his voice,
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; I see lightning and thus
[2:26:56] even when the sky is clear,
[2:27:01] pastor, you can't
[2:27:05] just leave this.
[2:27:07] [snorts and clears throat]
[2:27:08] My daughters always tell me,
[2:27:12] my sister's daughters
[2:27:14] is not there
[2:27:16] for more than 10 years.
[2:27:19] You don't understand
[2:27:23] not say that last.
[2:27:29] You see that guy
[2:27:31] but there's something he does and you
[2:27:34] understand
[2:27:37] indeed you are under spell
[2:27:40] and that is the devil spell
[2:27:45] brother when YOU ARE HERE LAST IS LAST
[2:27:51] YOU DON'T HAVE any other NAME
[2:27:54] LIE IS LIE
[2:27:57] WE WILL NOT EVEN SAY THAT HE'S TWISTED
[2:28:01] WHEN YOU LIE, YOU ARE A LIAR.
[2:28:04] [screaming]
[2:28:09] When you steal,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; don't say no. You see, I picked some
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; you have stolen.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; I not come to tell brother
[2:28:21] I picked your phone the other day.
[2:28:26] FAIL ME. I WAS overtaken
[2:28:30] and I stole your phone.
[2:28:33] Please forgive me. That is repentance.
[2:28:42] Praise be to God.
[2:28:45] Amen.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; So the devil is a HAWKER HIMSELF.
[2:28:50] THAT'S WHY LET US LOOK AT THE CROSS.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE TELLS US LET US LAY ASIDE
[2:28:58] EVERY WAY.
[2:29:00] LET US EASILY set us.
[2:29:03] Not only that, let us look unto Jesus
[2:29:07] who is the author.
[2:29:10] He's the auth of that faith. YOU BELIEVE
[2:29:13] AUTHOR OF THE SALVATION
[2:29:16] AUTHOR OF SALVATION
[2:29:18] Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us LET US
[2:29:21] LOOK TO HIM.
[2:29:23] THE MOMENT YOU TURN YOUR EYES THIS
[2:29:27] AND YOU last up to the devil's
[2:29:29] merchandise,
[2:29:33] the guy will follow you.
[2:29:39] He will follow you until you go to the
[2:29:40] grave.
[2:29:49] This is not love. This is love.
[2:29:52] This is normal.
[2:29:58] It's okay even SLEEP WITH THAT PERSON.
[2:30:02] HOW WILL YOU know
[2:30:05] more
[2:30:07] brother?
[2:30:09] If you are not sure whether you are
[2:30:11] normal,
[2:30:14] come for prayers.
[2:30:19] Before ministers here remove their hands
[2:30:21] from you,
[2:30:24] you already prove that you are more than
[2:30:31] Hallelujah.
[2:30:34] [laughter]
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[2:30:38] SO THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL IS.
[2:30:40] BUT NOW WE living in the TIME
[2:30:45] sin is everywhere.
[2:30:48] EVERY SIDE YOU LOOK
[2:30:51] UNTIL EVEN THE CHILDREN OF God they
[2:30:52] think it is no MORE
[2:30:56] THAT
[2:30:58] IT IS NOT KNOWN.
[2:31:06] It's not known
[2:31:08] Christian they ARE CHRISTIAN
[2:31:12] TIME MEMORIAL
[2:31:14] until today
[2:31:18] and God has a reason.
[2:31:21] Do you think Mary
[2:31:23] only Mary was the only virgin?
[2:31:28] I don't think so.
[2:31:32] No sir.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; There are many virgins.
[2:31:35] because I call it the Jewish law.
[2:31:39] A girl
[2:31:42] was it was abomination. Defile yourself.
[2:31:49] That's why even Joseph
[2:31:51] planned to divorce Mary.
[2:31:58] You see, but God had a reason.
[2:32:03] Mary had a purpose
[2:32:06] and you have a purpose.
[2:32:10] Praise be to God.
[2:32:13] But I'm in this message.
[2:32:17] The message this is church 86.
[2:32:22] The city was rich
[2:32:24] and owned by the wealth.
[2:32:27] It was full of culture. Science bounded.
[2:32:32] day
[2:32:34] which is rich, the beautiful worship
[2:32:38] and formal
[2:32:41] but cold and dead.
[2:32:45] YOU ENTER IN A CHURCH
[2:32:47] AND IT'S LIKE this
[2:32:53] light changing
[2:33:04] They had
[2:33:11] smoke blowers.
[2:33:14] [laughter]
[2:33:15] Blessed in the name of VERY BEAUTIFUL
[2:33:19] WITH A NICE CHOIR
[2:33:22] dressing so
[2:33:26] by that information
[2:33:29] Catholic choirs they don't put on mini
[2:33:31] skirts
[2:33:35] and they have different singers
[2:33:39] this group sings in they call it
[2:33:43] tener
[2:33:52] Look at the adventist.
[2:33:59] No one is pure.
[2:34:13] But the people in the congregation,
[2:34:17] some of them are crossing daily
[2:34:20] WhatsApp, others on WhatsApp.
[2:34:23] Dead worship.
[2:34:31] Dead worship.
[2:34:34] Culture and education have taken the
[2:34:36] place of this
[2:34:39] of spirit given word
[2:34:42] and faith has been has been uh supered
[2:34:46] by science.
[2:34:51] THAT MAN IS VICTIM OF MATERIALISM
[2:34:57] and from out of the CHAOS OF THE MODERN
[2:34:59] SCIENCE
[2:35:02] SCIENTIFIC
[2:35:04] that's where we are LIVING IN OF CULT
[2:35:06] AND SCIENCE AND EDUCATION
[2:35:10] and all this modern stuff
[2:35:15] that's why he says iniquity shall abide
[2:35:21] Praise be to God.
[2:35:23] Let me no one here admire that kind of
[2:35:25] worship.
[2:35:33] Sincers
[2:35:38] dress the way they want.
[2:35:41] The brother can even put pins in the
[2:35:43] ear.
[2:35:48] But for us brother,
[2:35:51] sister, this is old time holy spirit
[2:35:56] that devil want.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:36:03] If you take our pastor
[2:36:06] go and preach in one of those CHURCHES
[2:36:10] just two services
[2:36:14] where they having 2,000 followers
[2:36:18] you remain with 12
[2:36:21] or 10
[2:36:25] because this old time Holy Spirit
[2:36:30] Bible say THAT THE EARLY CHURCH
[2:36:33] TIME. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE CHURCH
[2:36:36] WAS IN TENSION
[2:36:41] TENSION.
[2:36:44] I think
[2:36:47] after the death of
[2:36:51] [laughter]
[2:36:55] praise be to God. And that is the first
[2:36:57] love
[2:36:59] BECAUSE GOD TOLD THEM RETURN TO THE
[2:37:02] FIRST LOVE.
[2:37:05] God enjoyed THAT
[2:37:07] BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT FEAR FELL
[2:37:10] UPON PEOPLE
[2:37:12] IF YOU HAD TO JOIN THAT CHURCH.
[2:37:16] THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE
[2:37:18] WHERE THE BIBLE SAY
[2:37:21] THE CMI CAME TO INVESTIGATE
[2:37:25] of the MAN AND WOMAN WHO DIED IN TVF.
[2:37:31] [snorts]
[2:37:32] Have you read it anywhere?
[2:37:40] Just drop some kid on the bin
[2:37:43] and they meet the child when they are
[2:37:45] still leaving.
[2:37:48] All security organizations they will
[2:37:50] look for you.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; BUT HERE COMES A MAN WHO HAS SOLD THIS
[2:37:54] LAND
[2:37:55] AND BROUGHT THE MONEY TO THE CHURCH
[2:37:59] TO HELP DVF WITH LAND COST.
[2:38:06] PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE WENT AND SOLD HIS
[2:38:09] LAND. LET ME take
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; we remaining with 75 million.
[2:38:16] Let me get this 40 million
[2:38:20] and also take
[2:38:23] a time brother Julius gave a lot of
[2:38:26] and then he was recognized
[2:38:28] that was the spirit behind.
[2:38:32] So when I sold it 100 million,
[2:38:36] I think it was sell all and bring.
[2:38:41] She sold maybe all
[2:38:44] and brought a quarter.
[2:38:54] [screaming]
[2:38:58] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; GOD IS SO GOOD.
[2:39:02] ALL NIGHT I WAS PRAYING AND THE HOLY
[2:39:04] GHOST CAME,
[2:39:06] God moved in her.
[2:39:09] My wife is coming. You know, she was
[2:39:12] quite by anointing.
[2:39:15] She was she woke up when she was
[2:39:18] but she's coming
[2:39:20] and the pastor was worshiping.
[2:39:23] Wow. Glory.
[2:39:30] If it is pastor will speak some tongues
[2:39:33] there
[2:39:38] if he will want to excite you very well
[2:39:41] he will speak something that was not
[2:39:45] the
[2:39:51] BROTHER
[2:39:53] IS THIS ALL [screaming]
[2:39:56] hallelujah
[2:39:57] praise the lord
[2:39:59] Yes, Pastor Peter.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; God always gives chances.
[2:40:07] ARE YOU SURE?
[2:40:09] ABSOLUTELY.
[2:40:12] SURE. SURE.
[2:40:16] My brother is speaking the truth.
[2:40:20] You mean you don't trust me?
[2:40:27] All right. You have not lied me. You've
[2:40:30] lied the Holy Ghost.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Imagine
[2:40:38] brother shalom
[2:40:42] shalom falling down
[2:40:44] and dies
[2:40:46] and then you check the heartbeat and it
[2:40:48] is no longer there. I doubt whether
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:40:59] What am I trying to show you? That was
[2:41:00] the fear in the church.
[2:41:05] SISTER CAME 30 MINUTES
[2:41:12] with a new bag maybe
[2:41:15] tinkling shoes
[2:41:17] because I tr I believe they were
[2:41:22] Yeah. So everybody had to know that they
[2:41:27] and maybe the brother had a special
[2:41:29] seat.
[2:41:32] The pastor tells us that sit with your
[2:41:34] wife.
[2:41:37] So maybe that day brother
[2:41:40] came and sat in front
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; the way where usually brotherham sits
[2:41:45] there came
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; and then sister came with artificial
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; probably had put on new hair
[2:41:56] up to the back
[2:41:59] with the back
[2:42:01] and some small uh lip
[2:42:09] Yeah. There also believer say you know
[2:42:13] my lips break break.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; So I have to put
[2:42:18] China.
[2:42:20] What is the purpose of your saliva in
[2:42:22] the mouth? [clears throat]
[2:42:25] Your tongue
[2:42:28] is to to WET YOUR LIPS.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU WANT artificial one?
[2:42:35] WHAT IS THE purpose of this?
[2:42:40] This is wiper
[2:42:44] when it is raining.
[2:42:47] Yeah. They wipe that.
[2:42:49] So you remove it and you write with
[2:42:56] the rain. Sister came.
[2:43:03] I am for that.
[2:43:07] I am
[2:43:10] REMEMBER
[2:43:12] THAT WAS shortly after the PENTECOST
[2:43:17] and the pastor was preaching.
[2:43:19] Receive the Holy Ghost. NEVER LET YOUR
[2:43:22] CONVICTION DIE.
[2:43:25] THEY'RE enjoying meals.
[2:43:27] They have time to ATTEND FELLOWSHIP.
[2:43:30] HOW CAN YOU PRAY FOR TWO HOURS?
[2:43:33] ARE YOU NORMAL? GOD IS EVERYWHERE.
[2:43:37] YES. The Bible say
[2:43:40] they KNOW HOW TO QUOTE.
[2:43:43] THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN YOU'RE JUST OPENING
[2:43:45] YOUR MOUTH
[2:43:47] ANSWER, I don't have time to pray long.
[2:43:52] I just open my mouth.
[2:43:57] So what about
[2:44:01] hello? Hallelujah.
[2:44:03] Maybe
[2:44:05] when she was entering,
[2:44:08] she ped the brother of those days
[2:44:11] of those days.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; I have a test
[2:44:17] and she had even come late
[2:44:20] and MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE INCIDENT THAT
[2:44:22] HAD HAPPENED, [screaming]
[2:44:26] maybe brother Julius gave her time to
[2:44:28] give a taste
[2:44:34] Praise the Lord, brethren.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[2:44:39] God is good
[2:44:42] all the time.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That is his nature.
[2:44:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:44:48] God did it.
[2:44:51] This week,
[2:44:54] AMEN. SISTER
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; SISTER SAF
[2:45:00] is this all that you
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; Yes pastor
[2:45:08] what the husband says
[2:45:10] even me it is what I'm saying but I
[2:45:13] thank God that my wife is not like that
[2:45:18] when I say something that is wrong
[2:45:21] she will she will interject
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; But SISTER
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; don't be yes WOMAN
[2:45:35] THE BROTHER TELLING IS TELLING TO BREAK
[2:45:36] THE WORD
[2:45:39] many
[2:45:43] and pastor Peter said the men were from
[2:45:47] buring your husband
[2:45:50] buring my husband
[2:45:53] My husband left management. He was
[2:45:55] spiritual.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; You have not lied to me. But you have
[2:46:02] lied the Holy Ghost. She also felt the
[2:46:06] church.
[2:46:12] Don't joke.
[2:46:14] And if this message, if the bride is
[2:46:17] going to write another book OF
[2:46:21] let us be careful.
[2:46:25] THE FEAR FELL AMONG HIS PEOPLE.
[2:46:29] I BELIEVE WHEN THE STATE feared
[2:46:35] the president say what's happened
[2:46:39] then maybe they inhered
[2:46:50] be the name and that is the church God
[2:46:54] want us to be
[2:46:58] PRAISE BE TO GOD. WE SHOULD NEVER LET
[2:47:01] THIS CHURCH
[2:47:03] BE A FOR BE A FORMAL CHURCH
[2:47:08] NEVER BECOME A FORMER WASHER.
[2:47:12] PRAISE BE TO GOD. HOW CAN A CHRISTIAN
[2:47:16] DOES IN CHURCH?
[2:47:21] [gasps]
[2:47:23] THAT IS
[2:47:25] THAT IS a sin.
[2:47:33] Just imagine the president is speaking
[2:47:42] it is sin.
[2:47:45] And if you want sin,
[2:47:49] brother, do you have a proof?
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. When Uticus was dozing in church,
[2:48:00] God never tolerated that.
[2:48:02] He allowed him to somersault
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; and he died
[2:48:12] and this is me.
[2:48:14] I think the reason as why resurrected
[2:48:19] maybe soul was going in the wrong place.
[2:48:24] He was dozing when the own of life was
[2:48:26] speaking.
[2:48:31] So he had to be given another chance.
[2:48:35] Blessed be the name of brother says turn
[2:48:39] on the light. He says the man turn on
[2:48:41] the light. He said that the grain should
[2:48:43] mature with the light.
[2:48:48] The thing is TODAY THE CHURCH GRAIN
[2:48:50] DON'T WANT TO MATURE.
[2:48:53] WANT TO STAY BACK TO STAY LIKE IT WAS
[2:48:55] BACK.
[2:48:58] BUT THIS IS ANOTHER HOUR.
[2:49:00] THIS IS ANOTHER DAY.
[2:49:03] THIS IS THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GOSPEL.
[2:49:07] It is coming to maturity.
[2:49:11] Amen. Many of them look like Christian.
[2:49:16] Act like CHRISTIAN
[2:49:18] TO have Christ INSIDE OF YOU.
[2:49:23] WHICH IS THE WORD MADE MANIFEST.
[2:49:27] OH, IT WILL NEVER MATURE
[2:49:30] INTO A REAL BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN.
[2:49:36] NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST
[2:49:37] you
[2:49:40] because thou has left your first love.
[2:49:43] The true church has lost first LOVE
[2:49:48] as the love of bride and groom.
[2:49:53] at their marriage and year of wedding of
[2:49:56] wedded life
[2:50:01] of a of a complete love and abandonment
[2:50:05] to God.
[2:50:13] Praise be to God. Is typing it with our
[2:50:16] early life of marriage.
[2:50:22] Praise the Lord. When she steal honey,
[2:50:27] sweetheart,
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; darling,
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; babe
[2:50:36] peps,
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; sweet peps,
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Rolex,
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Rolex,
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; whichever name you want.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; But many time you forget.
[2:50:50] that honey crystallizes.
[2:50:57] That doesn't mean that's no longer
[2:50:58] honey.
[2:51:05] Praise be to God.
[2:51:07] You just need to raise some little
[2:51:09] tempering
[2:51:12] for it to melt.
[2:51:18] Blessed be the name.
[2:51:21] So that's what the prophet is typing
[2:51:22] here.
[2:51:25] First love
[2:51:27] where you come TO CHURCH. YOU SPEND A
[2:51:30] NIGHT HERE PRAYING.
[2:51:32] EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE MORNING ARE
[2:51:36] HERE
[2:51:37] AT 7.
[2:51:40] IT IS ALREADY BURNING. PRAYING PRAYING
[2:51:43] FOR THE CHAIRS. FOR PULLPIT SPEAKING IN
[2:51:47] TONG. YOU ARE CRYING TO GOD YOUR HEART
[2:51:52] FOR THE SERVICE. YOU ARE PUTTING DEMONS
[2:51:54] UNDER under rest.
[2:51:59] But time came
[2:52:06] brother sister
[2:52:08] JUST KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT PRAYING no one
[2:52:13] is praying. Amen.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:52:21] WE ARE DUTY BOUND
[2:52:23] TO maintain
[2:52:27] by the grace of God
[2:52:31] the spiritual temperature of this church
[2:52:33] high
[2:52:38] by doing our PART
[2:52:41] and we leave the rest what we cannot do
[2:52:43] for God.
[2:52:47] BUT JUST IMAGINE
[2:52:49] YOU'VE NOT prayed in the morning. You
[2:52:52] not prayed through the week
[2:52:56] and then you come to church at 11
[2:53:01] [screaming]
[2:53:02] OR AT 10
[2:53:05] OR LATE
[2:53:07] AND when you reach here
[2:53:10] you just bow your head.
[2:53:14] Amen. Amen. Amen. [snorts] Then he
[2:53:18] started clapping.
[2:53:20] You missed the morning prayer.
[2:53:23] THE MORNING ANGEL
[2:53:25] WHO DID THE FIRST roll call,
[2:53:28] you were not there.
[2:53:31] AND THEN BEFORE THE SERVICE END,
[2:53:34] YOU'RE ALREADY OUT,
[2:53:37] THE ANGEL COME BACK again for another
[2:53:38] role.
[2:53:41] When you take the list before God,
[2:53:47] you are abusent.
[2:53:50] Amen. Return to your first love.
[2:53:55] Let us return to our FIRST LOVE.
[2:53:58] LET US SEE GOD WHILE HE'S STILL NEAR.
[2:54:03] Whichever things WE ARE SEEING IS
[2:54:04] PASSING AWAY.
[2:54:07] [screaming]
[2:54:08] S F
[2:54:11] AWAY.
[2:54:13] CLOTHES FADE.
[2:54:15] EVEN THE FASHIONS THEY PASS AWAY.
[2:54:24] Today you having a nice hair
[2:54:28] before you realize
[2:54:31] it is changing.
[2:54:36] Praise be to God.
[2:54:40] YOU CARE A LOT ABOUT YOUR HAIR THAT YOU
[2:54:44] SPEND TWO hours
[2:54:48] just doing THE HAIR.
[2:54:51] YOU SPEND THREE minutes
[2:54:54] in prayer
[2:54:59] and you are Christian.
[2:55:03] Are you Christ like
[2:55:10] let this be our mirror?
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:55:19] Just know that fashion will fade away.
[2:55:23] The beautiful mothers we are seeing
[2:55:25] today.
[2:55:27] I mean the old mothers we are seeing
[2:55:28] today.
[2:55:34] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:55:34] &gt;&gt; They were once beautiful like
[2:55:45] &gt;&gt; recent just I think two days ago
[2:55:50] I was uh I went to the village
[2:55:55] and I looked at my mother
[2:55:59] and I couldn't believe
[2:56:03] But that's nature.
[2:56:08] So let the hawker devil not deceive you
[2:56:16] but be soaked in the word.
[2:56:20] LET THE WORD GUIDE YOU.
[2:56:23] LET THE WORD GUIDE YOUR DRESSING.
[2:56:26] LET THE WORD GUIDE YOUR FASHION.
[2:56:29] BLESSED be the word.
[2:56:33] AMEN. LET THE WORD BE YOUR DESIRE
[2:56:41] because heavens and earth will pass.
[2:56:45] But this word will never pass.
[2:56:49] DON'T STAY HOME IF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART.
[2:56:54] YOU CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN
[2:56:56] OUT YONDER.
[2:57:01] YOU FEEL LIKE NOT GOING to the church,
[2:57:05] but you work from Monday to Saturday.
[2:57:08] No single day you feel like not going to
[2:57:14] but you're working so hard to impress
[2:57:15] your boss
[2:57:18] for even a promotion.
[2:57:20] But let me tell you, the Bible tells
[2:57:23] promotion comes FROM GOD
[2:57:26] FORCE,
[2:57:28] BUT from Almighty.
[2:57:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so tired.
[2:57:39] Serving God is a sacrifice.
[2:57:44] Jesus reached that point
[2:57:47] and said, "Father,
[2:57:49] it is POSSIBLE
[2:57:54] WEARY."
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; Have you ever sweated blood?
[2:57:59] Jesus sweated blood.
[2:58:05] YOU ARE SAYING YOU'RE GIVING UP.
[2:58:08] THE BIBLE SAYS, "HAVE YOU EVER RESISTED
[2:58:09] SIN TO THE POINT OF BLOOD?
[2:58:19] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[2:58:28] Listen as I'm winding up
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; in here fellowship with your brother. If
[2:58:33] you don't feel that way, then I tell you
[2:58:35] it is time you go to pray.
[2:58:40] If the spirit of God is in your heart,
[2:58:45] you you will not wait for those doors to
[2:58:47] be
[2:58:50] you not sit at home
[2:58:52] when the service comes.
[2:58:55] And here he says,
[2:58:57] if you feel that way,
[2:59:01] it's time you go to pray.
[2:59:06] TALK OF YOUNG PEOPLE.
[2:59:16] YOU KNOW I HAVE examples
[2:59:20] that's why that is why I wonder
[2:59:26] somebody slept from 7 in the morning up
[2:59:29] to 6 in the evening.
[2:59:33] When he wakes up,
[2:59:36] the first thing is to go to the phone
[2:59:40] after the phone eating. After eating
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; phone
[2:59:48] bed,
[2:59:54] this is a dead generation.
[2:59:58] Bathing
[3:00:00] long time forgotten.
[3:00:06] There's a young girl I know.
[3:00:18] Uh-uh. She's not here.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; You I don't know. You know, I don't know
[3:00:24] you,
[3:00:26] but
[3:00:28] she she's
[3:00:30] she can work on herself.
[3:00:34] She
[3:00:41] amen. That is the spirit of THIS AGE.
[3:00:45] TOO LESS EVEN TO SHOWER.
[3:00:53] LET ME HOPE THEY ARE NOT HERE.
[3:00:57] Our young brothers, let me hope you
[3:00:58] don't behave like that.
[3:01:02] WHEN GOD WAS GOING TO MEET ISRAEL,
[3:01:05] THIS IS INTERESTING.
[3:01:09] Let them shower.
[3:01:13] Let them WASH THEIR CLOTHES
[3:01:15] AND NOT GET CLOSE TO THEIR WIVES.
[3:01:21] Maybe that's why you have not received
[3:01:22] the Holy Ghost.
[3:01:24] You have repented. You have done
[3:01:26] everything. But maybe you don't want to
[3:01:28] shout.
[3:01:39] Praise the Lord. THAT IS THE SCRIPTURE.
[3:01:42] GOD IS CONCERNED ABOUT OUR BODY AS WELL.
[3:01:47] YES. Even our clothes.
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; Sometime we come to church.
[3:01:57] WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO WORK,
[3:01:59] YOU ARE SMART.
[3:02:01] BUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO CHURCH, YOU
[3:02:03] REACH HOME, YOU MOVE YOUR DECENT
[3:02:06] CLOTHES,
[3:02:08] MAYBE YOU get
[3:02:10] I have to have to be very careful here.
[3:02:13] Okay. Maybe you get a t-shirt
[3:02:18] with the word Uganda
[3:02:21] Uganda.
[3:02:26] Hey, brother Martin, you're getting too
[3:02:28] fast.
[3:02:31] My brethren, what I'm trying to say is
[3:02:35] this that God IS SO CONCERNED
[3:02:39] EVEN about how we present ourselves.
[3:02:43] Amen.
[3:02:46] BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAMMER THIS,
[3:02:50] the young PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION
[3:02:53] WILL BE SURPRISED.
[3:02:55] ONE DAY brother will COME WITH A VISIT.
[3:03:03] BUT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS IN YOU,
[3:03:05] [screaming] HE WILL GUIDE YOU.
[3:03:08] I'M GOING THE FATHER,
[3:03:11] I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU ALONE. AND
[3:03:13] THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[3:03:15] HE WILL TEACH YOU THIS THING
[3:03:19] even how to conduct yourself.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus never put on a
[3:03:33] Christian showering is a must.
[3:03:44] Yeah, you know our church is we have
[3:03:47] some good passage of young people.
[3:03:51] We can't speak about this
[3:03:55] because we don't speak about betting.
[3:04:01] WE DON'T SPEAK ABOUT GAMBLING.
[3:04:04] IT'S ALL ABOUT JESUS.
[3:04:07] AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE AMBASSADORS.
[3:04:11] GOD'S AMBASSADOR
[3:04:13] REPRESENTING ANOTHER COUNTRY
[3:04:16] OF HOLINESS
[3:04:18] where purity REIGN [screaming]
[3:04:23] of decency.
[3:04:26] [screaming]
[3:04:28] YES. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY WOMEN PUT
[3:04:33] ON modest appear
[3:04:37] with SHAMEFESTEDNESS
[3:04:45] but we are in a generation
[3:04:48] a woman will look at you.
[3:04:52] You meet them outside,
[3:04:55] she will look at you like this and then
[3:04:57] you look aside,
[3:05:00] she can look at you and even wink
[3:05:03] to say
[3:05:06] what is next
[3:05:13] but not daughters of God.
[3:05:17] They have they they have some shame.
[3:05:21] All Sarah's daughters are like that.
[3:05:23] They have shame.
[3:05:26] Shame.
[3:05:28] He can be there.
[3:05:30] It's as if he's not on the thing, but
[3:05:32] he's there.
[3:05:35] It is godly to be like that as a woman.
[3:05:40] But a woman saying,
[3:05:43] "What are you waiting for?
[3:05:47] Are you a kid?
[3:05:52] Run for your life.
[3:05:58] BUT THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD, THE SONS OF
[3:06:01] GOD.
[3:06:03] OUR CRY AND OUR DESIRE IS TO BE like
[3:06:05] him.
[3:06:09] Walk like Jesus.
[3:06:11] TALK LIKE
[3:06:13] JESUS. YES. AMEN.
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; I always say
[3:06:24] whatever thing which consumes a lot of
[3:06:26] your time apart from prayer,
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; it is the devil. Amen.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; We have a small god called phones.
[3:06:47] Let us be sincere and honest.
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; Then
[3:06:56] it also has applications.
[3:07:01] You will tell me brother Martin I use
[3:07:04] this thing to preach the gospel.
[3:07:07] That is okay.
[3:07:10] But if at all you're using it to preach
[3:07:11] the gospel as you're saying,
[3:07:14] how many souls
[3:07:19] so far
[3:07:23] that have been baptized coming from your
[3:07:25] Tik Tok
[3:07:27] you are having 3,000
[3:07:30] followers.
[3:07:33] Where are they?
[3:07:36] What are they following?
[3:07:40] Are you TAKING THE 3,000 SOUL TO HEAVEN
[3:07:42] OR TO HELL?
[3:07:49] So you better go
[3:07:52] and revisit your platform.
[3:07:59] Some believers they post funny funny
[3:08:01] things because they want followers.
[3:08:06] They follow us as you follow who?
[3:08:11] PAUL SAYS, "FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW YOU.
[3:08:14] BUT BECAUSE INIQUITY SHALL ABOUND,
[3:08:17] LOVE OF MEN shall work strong."
[3:08:21] Some have platforms.
[3:08:25] AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT SOME
[3:08:27] BELIEVERS ALSO HAVE THAT PLATFORM,
[3:08:32] they have account where they do their
[3:08:34] funny things.
[3:08:38] And also another account for everyone
[3:08:46] and there they will even change.
[3:08:52] I will not put there brother Martin.
[3:08:58] Uhuh.
[3:09:00] &gt;&gt; I will not put my name there.
[3:09:05] I will look for something. Oh, nature
[3:09:15] peacock.
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, a peacock.
[3:09:22] Now, as you say, you cannot know who.
[3:09:24] Don't forget there is an eye washing
[3:09:26] you.
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN EYE
[3:09:32] &gt;&gt; WASHING YOU.
[3:09:34] I DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAKE ACCOUNTS YOU
[3:09:36] have
[3:09:39] on your social media platforms,
[3:09:43] but there's an eye. It knows every
[3:09:46] account with every name.
[3:09:50] Don't repent and change and do what is
[3:09:53] right. And the blood covers your sin of
[3:09:58] judgment.
[3:10:00] It will be presented before you.
[3:10:09] where you record yourself dancing naked.
[3:10:14] On that day we shall see the real
[3:10:16] dustless news.
[3:10:21] My brothers,
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; let us return to the first line.
[3:10:25] Real worship,
[3:10:28] genuine worship,
[3:10:30] REAL PRAYER, SERVING GOD, SUPPORTING THE
[3:10:34] WORK OF GOD,
[3:10:36] GOD.
[3:10:42] Praise be to God.
[3:10:47] We have to say these things
[3:10:50] because this is what's going on
[3:10:53] and we have to help our sisters and
[3:10:55] brothers
[3:10:58] helping ourselves.
[3:11:01] You say that brother you have gone too
[3:11:02] personal
[3:11:05] if you're doing the right thing.
[3:11:08] Why don't do things on the light?
[3:11:13] Yes. M
[3:11:17] if you're posting the right thing on
[3:11:18] your status
[3:11:22] and you block some believers from it.
[3:11:28] Yes. WhatsApp have that provision
[3:11:31] WhatsApp.
[3:11:33] You can hide things from 100 people or a
[3:11:35] thousand
[3:11:39] and you only allow two people to see.
[3:11:42] Why do you want your light to shine for
[3:11:44] only two people?
[3:11:47] Let your light shine to the world.
[3:11:51] Let me hope they are not here.
[3:11:53] If you here in your heart,
[3:11:57] I'm sorry
[3:11:59] because I've never I've never visited
[3:12:01] apart from pastor's status maybe
[3:12:05] and some few
[3:12:08] brother
[3:12:10] Julius.
[3:12:12] Yeah. But one person does not check
[3:12:14] people status.
[3:12:18] So don't quote me wrong.
[3:12:21] And I'm speaking this because I'm
[3:12:23] standing before the pool.
[3:12:27] I don't check
[3:12:30] only just button on you.
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; It is only some few. May the Lord bless
[3:12:35] you.
[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[3:12:56] and we thank for the word that has gone
[3:12:57] forth.
[3:12:59] Blessed Jesus,
[3:13:02] we know that when you send your word,
[3:13:06] it will not return to you vid.
[3:13:09] Lord, you know the integrity of my
[3:13:10] heart.
[3:13:12] I was not attacking anyone,
[3:13:16] but I just pray because you led me that
[3:13:19] way.
[3:13:21] Lord Jesus, you know our downfalling and
[3:13:24] oppression.
[3:13:26] You know our failures. Lord, you know
[3:13:29] our troubles.
[3:13:33] You know the things we are battling
[3:13:35] with.
[3:13:36] I'm not saying this because I'm perfect.
[3:13:40] I'm fighting as well every day
[3:13:44] that you give me the grace.
[3:13:47] Help each one of us where your word has
[3:13:50] caught us unaware.
[3:13:56] Father, forgive us.
[3:13:58] Be merciful unto others.
[3:14:01] Restore our faith.
[3:14:04] Give us that love again,
[3:14:07] that fervent desire to seek you
[3:14:10] to thirst after righteousness.
[3:14:14] That is the cry of our heart.
[3:14:20] Heaven Father,
[3:14:22] if there be someone whose heart he
[3:14:24] desire,
[3:14:26] may the Holy Spirit speak to that heart
[3:14:29] and compel that heart
[3:14:32] to know that is not personal.
[3:14:38] Precious Jesus,
[3:14:40] give us the grace
[3:14:42] to overcome.
[3:14:45] We cannot do without you
[3:14:47] and we are leaning on your everlasting.

[3:21:19] So our parents will also request a hand.
[3:21:23] If you have something for us, you can
[3:21:26] come and see me or see brother Jo.
[3:21:30] Uh
[3:21:32] God bless you so much.
[3:21:55] God bless you, church.
[3:21:58] I mean, I'm so happy to be here.
[3:22:02] It's been a very long time.
[3:22:06] Yeah. And I think there just a few days
[3:22:09] left.
[3:22:12] So since for the interest of time
[3:22:16] I just want to send in a prayer request.
[3:22:20] Yeah. The surgery has not yet been done
[3:22:26] and there are more risks to take ahead
[3:22:29] of us.
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The doctor said that
[3:22:38] there's a chance of working on the eye
[3:22:40] and it doesn't work out
[3:22:48] then I have to wait for one whole year
[3:22:53] to work on it again.
[3:22:57] If they work on it many times
[3:23:01] it gets scars and then later on it fails
[3:23:03] to work totally.
[3:23:10] Yeah. The other option they gave us is
[3:23:13] to work at least to improve this one
[3:23:15] which has some sight
[3:23:20] or I wait with this one for one whole
[3:23:22] year
[3:23:25] until it's ready to be worked on.
[3:23:30] And therefore I'm requesting for your
[3:23:32] prayers
[3:23:34] so that the surgery comes out
[3:23:35] successfully.
[3:23:38] It's going to be around 3rd Jan. That's
[3:23:41] when we are going to go back for
[3:23:43] operation
[3:23:46] and I'm sorry to say that I won't be
[3:23:48] around for the youth meetings
[3:23:52] and I missed you so much.
[3:23:56] May God bless you.
[3:23:57] I'm going to ask brother.
[3:24:05] Let us ask brother to come and lead us
[3:24:08] in this prayer of faith as we pray for
[3:24:10] our brother. Amen. Pray from the bottom
[3:24:14] and from the depth of your heart.
[3:24:29] Let us pray.
[3:24:33] Almighty God,
[3:24:35] creator of heaven and earth,
[3:24:38] give out every good gift,
[3:24:40] we come before your presence
[3:24:43] with all our heart,
[3:24:45] pleading to you. The Bible tells us the
[3:24:50] chastisement of our peace
[3:24:53] was upon you. By your stripes,
[3:24:58] we are healed. Heavenly Father, I pray
[3:25:00] that you may intervene.
[3:25:03] Precious upon our brother, many things
[3:25:06] that he has served you in.
[3:25:08] And as we love him, Lord,
[3:25:11] father, we desire that it's well with
[3:25:13] him. Let the power of the Holy Ghost
[3:25:15] descend upon him right now. The crown of
[3:25:19] his head, the soul of his feet. Let it
[3:25:22] surround him. Father, we pray for a
[3:25:25] miracle. Father, we know that miracles
[3:25:27] are
[3:25:30] have done them before. Lord, you can do
[3:25:32] it. Father in any way, even the person
[3:25:36] that is going to work upon you, if it is
[3:25:39] your choice,
[3:25:41] Lord, I pray that you may guide those
[3:25:44] hands
[3:25:46] by the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[3:25:50] Lord, the perfect thing might be done.
[3:25:54] We surrender our brother right now
[3:25:56] for the praise and glory of your name in
[3:25:59] the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:26:02] Amen.
[3:26:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:26:09] Amen. So the Bible says that by his
[3:26:11] stripes we were healed.
[3:26:14] Amen. And as the prayer has been made,
[3:26:16] let's keep trusting the Lord that
[3:26:18] something has been done. Praise God.
[3:26:22] Have you been blessed by the word?
[3:26:26] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[3:26:27] praise.
[3:26:29] [applause]
[3:26:31] Thank you brother Martin for the word.
[3:26:33] We thank God so much. So as we are going
[3:26:37] to close let's just sing this uh simple
[3:26:39] chorus.
