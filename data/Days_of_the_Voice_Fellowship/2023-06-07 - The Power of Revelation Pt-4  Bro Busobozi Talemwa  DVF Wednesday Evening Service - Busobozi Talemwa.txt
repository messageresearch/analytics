also would like to thank brother Johnson on behalf of Brother Joseph and I to speak to their congregation as well yes so while we are preaching to you here at dvf we are also speaking to evening light bright so may the Lord bless us in the in the world tonight amen please go to our Bibles while we stand trillion Bible is a thing in the book of Hebrews yeah Hebrews chapter 11 so even the ones that strip me in this service the ones that also will watch it after sometimes we forget to mention about you but we certainly agree to all of you the name of Jesus Christ Hebrews 11 verses but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him is [Music] so I'm speaking on the power of Revelation this will be uh part 4.4 it's just the fourth time I'm speaking on the subject I'm just continuing to get delve a little bit deeper and deeper next time I feel that the Holy Spirit has more for us I'm just going to speak to you for an hour I'm asking for you and divided attention that we just delve right away into the world so the scripture has said amen he says that if they are diligent he will reward them may I tell you tonight that there is nobody that has ever sought God diligently and God never rewarded failed to reward themes [Music] God always rewards those that seek Him diligently but also he says that without faith it is impossible to please him foreign foreign [Applause] the only way of doing it the right way is doing it through faith you can do everything you want to do [Music] foreign you saw a prayed night after night but things are not working because you're not doing it in the right attitude even going to church must be done in the right attitude seeking for anything must be done in the right time if you do it in the right attitude of Faith the Bible says You must find out God hallelujah I mean but what is Faith this is that faith is a revelation I said what is faith is something revealed if if you have a neighbor look to them and tell them faith is something revealed if you pray without faith [Music] from your wife Channel Revelation doesn't come from your boss Revelation comes from God that's God who gives Revelation how does he give it yeah the Bible here says praise the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God Romans 10 17. it is how do you receive faith when you begin to sit down under the preaching Of The World God used as a preacher the more you hear the words the more faith begins to then you receive something from above foreign [Music] all the great women of God and Men of God the power of Revelations Hallelujah I mean this message that can teach you this message God must put the message there are many things that even maybe brother but you cannot understand me where it says I believe I cannot drinks I tell you it is you must received foreign am I preaching to someone and we already saw about David and we were already sing about John the Baptist something rather Samson and brother mean that message Faith expressed I want to tell you something that's part of a moment how many of you when you were here in the world it has happened on me many times one moment I begin to feel that procession under that power what is going to happen even in your life that very moment I can say that yeah [Music] foreign Hallelujah what how can this uncircumcised the first time Goliath was tormented he remembered what God told Abraham he remembered what Moses the circumcision now listen Hallelujah [Music] I am revelation there is revealed to him um now what do you think when those Philistines said now look come there that little shrimp only about four foot and half tall to begin with with seven little cards hanging down his back like Mama's Little about Samsung although yes he's talking about something you know having you know those cars hanging down here Mama's little sister and look at us what a great Army we are isn't that ridiculous he was expressing to those Philistines what had been revealed to him he grabbed the job because that's what he puts in his hands put that in his hand that's what he believed he could do it and by doing so he was expressing to those Philistines I tell you if you hold foreign foreign foreign Hallelujah man and that moment I said Samson Samson beat that job and he's as he approached the first Village he was like Yeah The Power of Revelations Como if you believe it says [Applause] Hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord the power of Revelation and here comes John the Baptist says John the Baptist in the message works his face expressed his faith by his works and when he said they are stands the one among you now just think of that Saint John I got a scripture Saint John 1 26 he says they said you say the Messiah is coming soon why he said man what's the matter with you we've been looking for him for four thousand years he said he is standing right Among Us foreign but that's part of a moment something he knew the world you see Revelation comes from the Justice of the world are you hearing me if you don't know the world Amen is the best machine through which God throws down Revelations Faith cometh by hearing okay and so you must know the world that's why we teach the message what does that do the Builder foreign he had never known who he was here and there he was there you are standing right Among Us he said there is one standing among you now who you know not and I am not worthy to lose the latches on his shoes foreign together come here and read your quote Securities you can read quotes yourself you can read scriptures the way I act there is express myself preaching to you by revelations that's why myself Cinema when you are hearing the word even to you who are streaming on zoom and you're at home by yourself [Applause] you stand up when you have to bring that life out of you have to bring something out of you you cannot be the same if you are the same then you are not receiving is sit down two people sitting together one of them go crazy and another one is same chairs almost same place differentiate into what I'm preaching to you tonight is it was given to me on 12th May Friday I was sitting back there one of the brothers I don't remember it was maybe Brother Martin who was preached alive some of the words something is revealed to you it is foreign [Music] Hallelujah man when you are facing a trial and God reveals to you that it is time she said break out of it is time to received your freedom someone may be blind um one day he woke up different God revealed to him and that very moment his eyes open and if you want the Holy Ghost and you receive a Revelations I told you about testimony I was just walking with a young man and they were walking walking talking about Jesus Christ is the life of Jesus it is Jesus Christ himself he wants to come into your life so he can lead you I couldn't guide you so he can you know overcome and he's more willing to come in you are willingness I said yes it was revealed it was made acceptable foreign foreign [Applause] pretty Rock amen faith is revelation if you begin if God reveals to your things before you receive it you begin acting like a Botanical questions he called them a certain name like like pins and stuff but it really meant you know those babies clothes they've begun to go and buy them again so these old people buying things and things I said are you crazy we see ourselves you see us menopause but my wife foreign [Applause] for yourself [Applause] for yourself some young people come to disappoint you to discourage you organize it is not possible now the Holy Spirit led me to you so I'm preaching to you directly and they tell it is not possible but it cannot happen right now let me tell you you have faith then you must be able to tell them look for yourself don't talk for me not for yourself when you get it for me I know my story is of faith it is going to happen no demons foreign Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory how to prove that it was true working right out of the crowd well [Music] walking down through there dressed like other men said there is amen John must have said I said it I said it I said it I told you here among you yeah can't you see now the Church of Jesus Christ is beautiful I mean Jesus says upon this Revelation I will rebuild my child the girls bipolar [Applause] how many know what that condition is bipolar praise the name of God if you don't go and read about it bad condition it's like a maniac state but actually it can be controlled by medicine he came right in the prayer line we were standing there passing me down myself and other ministers and he he prophesied to that I don't know but by the power of the Holy Ghost I was right there I was in front of him this bipolarships in the name of Jesus Christ the man has gone to do some medical exams foreign Hallelujah man now to prove Jesus came out of the of the congregation yes Hallelujah man praise the number I have a few more minutes I see I may not even still get done tonight let's see so Jesus comes out yes of the congregation and then John said there's a lamb of God how do you know him um he said he that said to me in the wilderness upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending that's the one that will baptize see he knew him because there was supposed to be a sign about that time are you catching it John new you're running a mess about the hour because he was a prophet it was revealed to him but he know would be about that time he would see a sign and when he's seen that signed standing among you know it was there you must have the word first revelation is not presumptuous talking face no it is because God says it is revealed to me this scripture oh I see the signs at the end time is here I see that thing that's promised for this end time message [Music] exactly like the scripture says oh friends can't you see all the end times the Bible says that he was in the days you know the time that was the time right in the tent um right there and you know at that moment when those things were happening every time we're gonna get a muscle and we see the same condition today we can I can say by the authority of the world we are at a time truly movies you know closing of the ages be like the fools who say it has been said that the end is coming and Jesus is coming it does not happen [Music] but then it says don't you know with God one day is like a thousand years and one thousand years but for the Believers because we are going to see the signs one of the signs of the time God said he will send a prophet foreign foreign I saw on the news should have been fake news maybe because other news agencies have come up to say well it is not true but if it is not true then why why was it there out in the first place there's no fire without smoke the world is headed for total insanity make sector sport heard something about water into people that live around water around more rooms I don't think that Peter was a virgin this is Jesus came yes yes and one time when he went back to fish before he realized it his pants were down he had removed his clothes the spirit of the water and when Jesus came yes we rushed to dress himself what does Jesus intend for us yes send our testimony to our adventure yes and it is saying this I have it now because I have received God's promise he is wax is not coming out of the abundance of what has happened amen you begin to act right you begin to say I'm here foreign

chains show yourself thank you Jesus and then it will happen thank you for my healing thank you thank you for answering Hallelujah let it happen right now thank you Jesus I know Jesus is here so

many voices I'm speaking to you now in the name of the Lord and I'm telling you this that God still speaks if you accept it and you believe it he doesn't speak only by the word someone may want to say to limit him God has spoken to you from the moment you heard this message and believed it but he wants to take you deeper he doesn't speak only when you had the first time or when he read the scripture he wants to to bring that procession in your heart oh can we hunger for him I want to reach where the angels in that place where all things are possible foreign [Music] he's the same
