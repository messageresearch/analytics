[31:29] [Music]
[31:32] Genesis chapter

[31:37] 28
[31:38] verses

[32:35] his pillow and lay down in that place to
[32:39] sleep and it dreamed and behold the lad
[32:42] set up on the earth and the top of the
[32:45] the top of it reaches to heaven and
[32:48] behold the angel of God ascending and
[32:51] descending on it and behold the Lord

[33:34] portion of the scripture we have read we
[33:37] ask you Lord Jesus that may you come
[33:40] Lord and just speak to that Soul speak
[33:43] to my soul as well take me out of the
[33:47] way just come Lord and Whisper the word
[33:49] of encouragement to us Lord Jesus father
[33:52] we thank you in Christ Jesus we
[33:55] pray amen men may have your
[34:01] seats
[34:05] Christmas
[34:08] yeah what you say
[34:12] cras uh this
[34:14] evening I just have some uh thought that
[34:18] I want us to share in maybe like one
[34:22] hour and you pray for me as I told you
[34:25] now
[34:32] that's my
[34:34] consolation that God
[34:37] knew
[34:40] amen yeah
[34:42] so I want us to I'm going
[34:47] to call my text
[34:51] tonight that you need an open
[34:55] Heaven amen
[34:58] blessed be the name of the
[35:01] Lord that's all that we need in this
[35:05] life when a
[35:07] Believer prays or goes before God and
[35:11] Heavens
[35:13] open brother sister that's all we need
[35:16] amen and even as we coming to the end of
[35:18] this
[35:20] year what's going to keep us moving
[35:23] what's going to push us through the year
[35:25] is that open heaven
[35:27] blessed be the name of the Lord you know
[35:30] when Heaven opens something happens
[35:33] praise the Lord When Heaven opens it's
[35:36] not just opening for the sake of opening
[35:40] but when God opens
[35:42] Heaven he
[35:44] opens when he want to say something and
[35:48] when God
[35:49] speaks something happens blessed be the
[35:53] name of the Lord and where we have read
[35:56] in Genesis this is the uh it is the
[35:59] story of Jacob and this is what happened
[36:03] amen this is not the story of it's not a
[36:06] fable stories blessed be the name of the
[36:08] Lord but when we are talking about what
[36:11] is written in the Bible this is the sure
[36:14] word of Prophecy and whatever is written
[36:17] here it is not just a story but this is
[36:21] what happened amen when God spoke in the
[36:25] beginning that the prophet say that God
[36:28] believed his word and the world came
[36:31] into existence that's why without faith
[36:34] it is impossible to please God Amen so
[36:38] when we come before God we have to come
[36:42] believing that God is going to speak and
[36:46] when God speaks to us we have to take it
[36:49] as a serious thing
[36:51] amen praise the Lord so yeah where we
[36:55] have read you remember the the story of
[36:57] Jacob and Esau how Jacob stole his
[37:00] brother's
[37:01] Birthright but we know that how God had
[37:04] per passed before the foundation of the
[37:06] world that before Jacob was born the
[37:10] Bible says that God hated Esau and loved
[37:15] Jacob for his reasons amen not Jacob's
[37:19] reason but God's reason God loved Jacob
[37:23] and hated Esau and the sacred was with
[37:27] her mother
[37:28] Rebecca praise be to God Amen because
[37:32] you remember that she had battle in her
[37:35] womb until she had no peace the bible
[37:39] say that she went to the temple to ask
[37:42] God of what was happening in her womb
[37:46] and the Lord spoke to her and told her
[37:49] that in your womb you have two Nations
[37:52] and say that but the Elder Shall Serve
[37:55] the younger amen so she came back when
[37:59] she had already gotten the answer what
[38:01] do we see from there that when we have a
[38:04] troubl situation around us amen the
[38:07] right place to go is in the house of God
[38:10] is to go in the temple of God and
[38:13] inquire from the Lord blessed be the
[38:16] name of the Lord and God always want us
[38:20] to inquire from
[38:21] him you remember in the Bible when God
[38:24] rejected soul and so when to the witch
[38:27] of endo to
[38:29] inquire about what the Lord was speaking
[38:31] about him can you
[38:34] imagine blessed be the name of the
[38:37] Lord and
[38:41] God no I think it was I believe it was
[38:46] Ahab Saul yes it was
[38:48] Saul he went to
[38:51] inquire and the same thing happened to
[38:54] Ahab when Ahab sent his servants to go
[38:57] and
[39:00] consult and the Bible says God spoke to
[39:02] Elijah and told him to go and meet those
[39:06] Servants of Ahab and when he met them he
[39:10] asked them is there no God in Israel
[39:14] that you're are going to consult blessed
[39:16] be the name of the Lord so God always
[39:19] want us to consult from him praise be to
[39:22] God back to our sharing here we're
[39:27] seeing and uh time came for Jacob he had
[39:32] run home he sto his brother's Birthright
[39:35] and he went to laban's place where he
[39:38] was he stole from Laban by using his
[39:42] tricks and he had gathered a
[39:45] lot and not only that he had worn now
[39:49] two daughters of leban blessed be the
[39:52] name of the Lord and time had come for
[39:56] him
[39:57] to go
[39:58] back praise the
[40:00] Lord but remember where he was coming
[40:05] from
[40:08] so and where he was supposed to go he
[40:11] had issues to set out from the other
[40:14] side so he was in the middle there
[40:17] blessed be the name of the Lord but
[40:19] remember God had spoken to the mother
[40:22] that the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[40:25] and when month when Rebecca knew when he
[40:29] heard that Jacob wanted to
[40:32] bless he son he you know all the trick
[40:36] she played the role she played blessed
[40:39] be the name of the Lord and then Jacob
[40:42] things were just okay with
[40:52] him so he went to Le so from there he
[40:56] used this tricks and things were just
[40:59] okay but God wanted to meet Jacob
[41:03] blessed be the name of the Lord God
[41:06] wanted to have time with Jacob and they
[41:09] talk about this promise amen each one of
[41:13] us God want to meet us at a certain
[41:17] point and discuss with us about this
[41:20] promise brother Peter try to I need more
[41:23] voice I feel like I'm using a lot of
[41:25] energy
[41:26] amen blessed be the name of the Lord and
[41:29] here where we have read if you come up
[41:32] here see then went Esau unto Ishmael and
[41:35] took unto the wives which he had
[41:38] mahalala the daughter of ishma Abraham's
[41:41] son the sister of of
[41:44] neba to be his wife and Jacob went out
[41:48] from BBA and went toward Haron and he
[41:52] lighted up a certain place and Ted there
[41:55] all night because the sun was set and he
[41:58] took off a stone of a place and put them
[42:01] for his pillow and laid down in that
[42:04] place to sleep and he
[42:07] dreamed remember you need an open
[42:10] Heaven Jacob reached a point when deals
[42:15] could no longer serve him Jacob loved
[42:18] God inside his heart but things were not
[42:22] working out for him why he had not taken
[42:25] his time to do inventory in his life and
[42:30] that's what God wanted amen so time came
[42:35] brother we have the promise and our
[42:37] Prophet tells us that we have to fight
[42:41] for every inch of these
[42:43] promises but not until we understand
[42:47] that we do have them and they are for R
[42:51] and we must do something toward it
[42:54] blessed be the name of the Lord am so
[42:56] Jacob reached that point he wanted to go
[42:59] back he was chased from where he
[43:02] was and fin enough when they were living
[43:06] the daughters told their father's
[43:20] Gods
[43:24] amen he raised problem from either
[43:30] side but as long as you still have a
[43:35] mind brother time will
[43:38] come time is going to come when God will
[43:41] block all those
[43:43] Avenues why because he want us to look
[43:45] unto
[43:46] him he said look unto me all the ends of
[43:50] the world and the prophet says in that
[43:52] message that every time when the world
[43:54] is coming to an end there is a voice
[43:57] calling us to look unto
[43:59] Jesus
[44:01] amen he tells us to lay aside every
[44:04] weight and every sin that do easily
[44:07] beset us that to run this rest with
[44:09] patience looking unto Jesus praise me to
[44:12] God so that evening Jacob was
[44:16] troubled and Jacob had no other option
[44:20] but inside Jacob's heart there was a
[44:23] seed of God there was a voice
[44:27] speaking to him many times before we go
[44:30] deep into things that we are deep into
[44:34] maybe it is sin maybe it is trouble
[44:37] there is a voice which always warns us
[44:40] before we go
[44:41] deeper but most time we realize when we
[44:44] are already far amen and that's where
[44:47] the devil want you when you look back
[44:50] you see it's very far to come out of
[44:52] thetion you are in blessed be the name
[44:55] of the Lord
[44:57] but each one of us we have that
[45:00] voice at a certain point in the message
[45:04] from that time the prophet says that
[45:07] everything has a point when it started
[45:10] in our life whether good or
[45:14] bad he said you can still remember the
[45:17] first lie you have ever told and when
[45:20] you told when you spoke that lie you
[45:23] added you kept on lying and lying and
[45:25] lying
[45:28] today today you can even sit and cook
[45:36] a talk of habits in our lives talk of
[45:39] fornication for those who do
[45:42] fornicate there's a point when it
[45:46] started and you disobeyed The Voice amen
[45:51] the prophet calls it that red flag the
[45:54] conviction in our heart is God's red
[45:57] flag which you put in our
[46:00] heart but when you disobeyed that you
[46:04] found you realize oh found s like it's
[46:07] no longer bothering you you fornicate
[46:09] every time you want to
[46:11] fornicate blessed be the name of the
[46:13] Lord but there is a point you reach and
[46:16] you feel uhuh this is not a Christian
[46:20] Life something must happen What can I do
[46:25] that is the point I'm talking about
[46:27] right now amen and the only solution is
[46:31] you need an open
[46:33] Heaven that is where your answer is you
[46:37] need to encounter God you can call it
[46:39] personal experience with God blessed be
[46:42] the name of the Lord and when you need
[46:45] when you encounter that open Heaven
[46:48] brother that changes the whole story
[46:50] that changes each and everything in your
[46:53] life blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:56] and he dreamed and behold a light set
[46:58] upon on earth and the top of it reached
[47:03] heaven and behold the angel of God
[47:06] ascending and descending on
[47:09] it there is a point we must reach amen
[47:14] where the angels of God ascending and
[47:17] descending that is where God want us to
[47:20] reach because the prophet say that
[47:22] angels are ministering Spirits they are
[47:25] here to minister to
[47:28] Us beside the preaches stand on the
[47:31] pulpit but God's angels they are to
[47:35] serve as the
[47:37] bride and God want us to reach somewhere
[47:41] amen where are the
[47:44] angels are descending and
[47:47] ascending 20 and behold the Lord stood
[47:51] above
[47:52] it on the top of the ladder

[48:06] Abraham thy father in the god of
[48:10] Isaac in the land where thou
[48:13] liest to thee will I give
[48:17] it andto thy
[48:19] seed this man was thinking about about
[48:23] the The Inheritance
[48:26] which he told from his brother but God
[48:29] is revealing it to him now amen when he
[48:32] encountered the open Heaven God started
[48:35] to reveal to him things he did not
[48:38] know amen that this was not only about
[48:42] the inheritance but even the land where
[48:45] thou liest right now amen I have given
[48:49] it to thee amen when God reveals himself
[48:54] to us he start to reveal to manifest to
[48:58] us the things we did not know blessed be
[49:01] the name of the Lord amen there on to
[49:06] thee will I give it to will I give it
[49:09] and to thy seed not only to him and to
[49:13] his seed blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:17] you remember John the
[49:18] Baptist when Jesus appeared on the scene
[49:21] when John was
[49:23] baptizing in Matthew
[49:26] uh is Matthew 3:4 we shall read
[49:30] there can you go to Matthew chapter 3:
[49:42] 14 Matthew
[49:54] 3:14
[50:07] no I think I'm missing
[50:16] it
[50:19] three oh sorry I I was reading I was
[50:22] wondering I was in another scripture
[50:25] Matthew
[50:38] 3:14 we can start from that he says and
[50:40] then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan
[50:44] and to John to be baptized of him but
[50:48] John forbid him saying I have need to be
[50:52] baptized of thee and come th thou to me
[50:57] and Jesus answering said unto him suffer
[51:01] it to be so now for thus it becometh us
[51:06] to fulfill all righteousness then he
[51:09] suffered him and Jesus when he was
[51:14] baptized went up straight away out of
[51:17] the water and lo the heavens were open
[51:21] unto him
[51:24] amen
[51:25] after all the scripture was
[51:28] fulfilled because John he tried to
[51:32] refuse say you're the one who is greater
[51:34] than me but Jesus told him suffer it to
[51:36] be so because it be cometh us to fulfill
[51:40] all the righteousness of God and after
[51:43] the righteousness of God was fulfilled
[51:45] something happened and John baptized him
[51:49] and Jesus when he was baptized went out
[51:52] straight away out of the water and lo
[51:55] all Heaven were open unto him and he saw
[51:58] the spirit of God descending like a dve
[52:01] and lighten upon him blessed be the name
[52:05] of the Lord Jesus to continue with his
[52:09] ministry something had to happen amen
[52:13] and when Jesus was baptized coming out
[52:16] of the water heaven was
[52:19] open he engaged another gear in other
[52:23] words blessed be the name of the Lord
[52:26] Even in our Christian walk brother
[52:28] sister we need heaven to open for us we
[52:33] need that experience that is what is
[52:35] going to keep us going because after
[52:38] Jesus was baptized the Bible says he was
[52:41] led in the wilderness to be tempted of
[52:44] the
[52:45] devil he had already had what was more
[52:48] than enough to defeat the enemy blessed
[52:51] be the name of the Lord the same thing
[52:54] happened to Jacob when he got that dream
[52:58] amen something happened in his life that
[53:01] fear
[53:02] went amen and from that time Jacob was
[53:07] the changed man blessed be the name of
[53:09] the Lord what caused that it was open
[53:13] Heaven praise be to God and I'm telling
[53:16] you my brothers my sister as we
[53:19] approaching the end of this year we need
[53:21] open Heaven that is what we are that's
[53:24] what we need tonight amen every home
[53:27] need open Heaven every brother need open
[53:31] Heaven every sister need open Heaven
[53:34] amen because when Heaven opens
[53:37] Supernaturals will start taking place
[53:40] amen When Heaven opens healing will take
[53:43] over when Heaven opens Vision will burst
[53:47] in our midst When Heaven open tongues
[53:50] and interpretation will happen in our
[53:53] midst amen
[53:56] Heaven does not just open for
[53:59] excitement but God most time he comes to
[54:03] vindicate himself to us because the
[54:06] Bible says in HEB in Romans that it's
[54:09] not God of the dead but is God of the
[54:12] living and some of the characteristics
[54:14] of the living beings you know them
[54:18] amen we must have Christians who are
[54:22] sure that their God is living
[54:26] God want to speak to us lips to ear he
[54:29] want to speak to us in many ways amen we
[54:33] must have that Upper Room experience
[54:35] which is the open Heaven blessed be the
[54:38] name of the Lord and God has always
[54:41] worked like that even during the time of
[54:44] Elijah after he stopped the rain for
[54:46] three and a half years amen and when he
[54:49] open the rain again blessed be the name
[54:52] of the Lord something happened in the
[54:54] sky
[54:56] amen praise be to
[54:59] God Heaven hard to
[55:10] open why because heaven had
[55:14] opened amen and rain was going to rain
[55:18] on the earth after three and a half
[55:21] years and what the church need tonight
[55:24] we need the open heaven we need the
[55:27] outpouring of Pentecost not only on the
[55:31] out being amen but we need the life
[55:34] changing experience in our soul which
[55:37] comes with open Heaven blessed be the
[55:40] name of the
[55:41] Lord
[55:43] hallelujah amen when Jesus came out of
[55:47] the water brother sister Heaven open and
[55:50] the voice spoke this is my beloved Son
[55:53] in whom I'm well placed to to dwell in
[55:56] he him amen When Heaven opens there is a
[56:01] voice saying he him because he my
[56:06] beloved Son whom I'm well pleased to
[56:08] dwell into blessed be the name of the
[56:11] Lord so what do we need tonight we need
[56:14] open Heaven each one of us that's what
[56:17] you need brother sister our young
[56:20] students you need to open heaven to push
[56:23] you at school to protect you amen every
[56:27] time you feel like the heaven is closed

[56:32] God intercede amen and when Heaven opens
[56:36] you'll come out there when you are
[56:39] charged blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:43] hallelujah and Jesus answering said unto
[56:46] him suffer it to be so now for thus it
[56:50] becometh us to fulfill all the
[56:53] righteousness then he suffered
[56:57] him blessed be the name of the Lord and
[57:01] John chapter 1: 51 says and he says unto
[57:04] him very ver unto you Hereafter you
[57:08] shall see Heaven
[57:11] open and the angels of God ascending and
[57:14] descending upon the son of man amen When
[57:18] Heaven opens brother sister When Heaven
[57:21] opens to a sister or to a brother you
[57:24] will see nothing other than Angels
[57:26] descending and ascending upon you amen
[57:30] this is Jesus's word in John chapter 1
[57:32] vers
[57:34] 15 Jesus himself speaking to them that
[57:37] when Heaven
[57:38] open that and he says unto
[57:42] them John chapter
[57:46] 1 ver
[57:53] 51
[58:00] this was Jesus encounter with nathel and
[58:03] he told
[58:04] him when Jesus discerned him and said
[58:10] behold an Israelite indeed in whom
[58:12] there's no gu NE said unto him West thou
[58:16] knowest thou me and Jesus answered and
[58:18] said unto him before that Philip called
[58:21] thee when thou was under the fig tree
[58:25] I saw thee and nathel answered and said
[58:28] unto him rabi Thou Art the Son of God
[58:32] and thou are the king of Israel and
[58:36] Jesus answered and said unto him behold
[58:39] because I said unto thee I saw thee
[58:43] under the Fig Tree believeth thou
[58:46] believest though thou shallal see
[58:48] greater things than
[58:51] this and he said unto him really really
[58:55] I say unto you the greater things Jesus
[58:59] is now trying is expanding to him amen
[59:03] after he after he was discerned by the
[59:05] word after you are discerned by the word
[59:09] and now you believe that it was not man
[59:12] but the word of God Discerning your
[59:14] heart and Jesus told him if you believe
[59:18] this greater thing are yet to
[59:22] happen blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:25] when you believe the message greater
[59:28] things are yet to
[59:30] happen amen Jesus was the voice in that
[59:34] time and nathel came he got an encounter
[59:39] with the word of his time and Jesus told
[59:42] him if you believe amen greater things
[59:46] are yet to happen and what are those
[59:48] great things
[59:50] really very really he was putting
[59:53] emphasis here I said unto you Hereafter
[59:57] you shall see Heaven open brother sister
[1:00:02] it has not stop with only believing the
[1:00:04] word and putting on long skirts and
[1:00:07] putting on long hair amen there are
[1:00:10] things which are more than that heaven
[1:00:13] will have to
[1:00:14] open amen and God's blessings will have
[1:00:19] to rain Upon
[1:00:21] Us blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:26] and the angel of God sending and
[1:00:27] ascending upon the son of
[1:00:30] man praise the
[1:00:33] Lord in the message the unchangeable
[1:00:36] word of God the prophet says see what
[1:00:40] kind of a home an angel comes
[1:00:43] to a home that keeps the Commandments of
[1:00:47] God A Home of a people that walked
[1:00:50] upright before God and if you want the
[1:00:54] horor of the Angel visiting your
[1:01:01] homes
[1:01:04] amen angels can visit our
[1:01:08] homes literal
[1:01:11] angels angels have visited Believers
[1:01:14] home you know we have to reach we have
[1:01:16] to reach to a point whereby these things
[1:01:19] are not
[1:01:20] imagination because angels are real
[1:01:23] being
[1:01:25] they are real amen but why are we not
[1:01:30] seeing them because we have not set our
[1:01:34] heart we have not asked God to see
[1:01:37] them amen but if we do the needful the
[1:01:42] prophet tells us we shall get the very
[1:01:44] result they
[1:01:47] got so he say that an angel comes to a
[1:01:50] home that keeps the
[1:01:51] Commandment number we must keep the
[1:01:54] Commandment of God in our
[1:01:57] homes of home of people walks upright
[1:02:01] before God and if you want the Horn of
[1:02:04] the Angel visiting your home having home
[1:02:07] ready for him to visit prepare amen
[1:02:12] prepared and ready under the blood of
[1:02:14] the Lamb you want God to visit that home
[1:02:17] let us prepare be sure that you are
[1:02:20] under the blood of the lamp the angels
[1:02:22] will Vis that home
[1:02:27] brother have you ever seen an angel
[1:02:30] yes are you talking of the minister not
[1:02:32] the minister but the real
[1:02:36] angels blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:39] they are
[1:02:41] real and they're the one who God us
[1:02:45] every now and then even when we are
[1:02:47] walking multiple times sometime you're
[1:02:50] walking on the road and you're listening
[1:02:53] to the message do you think that the
[1:02:54] devil is
[1:02:55] happy
[1:02:59] no it is the Angel of the Lord
[1:03:02] protecting you against accident and
[1:03:05] other
[1:03:06] attacks very many times the devil has
[1:03:09] tried to destroy you but the angel of
[1:03:12] the Lord has been there for you the
[1:03:16] blood of Jesus has always been there for
[1:03:18] you very many time the devil speaks bad
[1:03:21] words against us but the Bible says the
[1:03:24] blood of Jesus speaks of good
[1:03:28] words the devil is a Chooser of Brethren
[1:03:32] he was before God choosing Jacob amen
[1:03:36] and God was listening he did not know
[1:03:39] that God had another plan that very
[1:03:42] evening maybe in the morning the devil
[1:03:44] was there buing like a green fly God you
[1:03:47] see Jacob you said you see
[1:03:50] Jacob you know the devil does not know
[1:03:53] what your thought is
[1:03:54] not until you speak it out but in God's
[1:03:58] mind God already had a preparation for
[1:04:00] Jacob I believe that day Jacob had the
[1:04:04] most trouble day but later did he know
[1:04:07] that in the evening time glory amen
[1:04:12] something was going to
[1:04:15] happen there shall be light in the
[1:04:17] evening
[1:04:18] time so Jacob was troubled but sometime
[1:04:22] something in Jacob's heart was telling
[1:04:24] him the Victor is just knocking at the
[1:04:27] door and the prophet says before the
[1:04:29] dead Dawn there is that gross Darkness
[1:04:32] amen but whenever you see that cross
[1:04:35] cross Darkness it is a sign that the
[1:04:37] light is coming somewhere just wait a
[1:04:40] minute when the light sprangs out the
[1:04:43] darkness will have to flee amen so Jacob
[1:04:47] was in that L
[1:04:49] time I think I believe he was now
[1:04:52] repenting oh God I toldo my brother's
[1:04:54] Birthright oh god I've cheated from
[1:04:57] Laban oh God even I don't know and the
[1:05:01] Wes that had another problem they had
[1:05:04] stolen the strange God their father's R
[1:05:08] so the man did not even know and when
[1:05:11] realized
[1:05:13] that the Bible says he came running
[1:05:16] after them and this
[1:05:18] girl the devil can anoint somebody the
[1:05:22] devil can
[1:05:28] when the father of this girl came one
[1:05:32] girl refused to come out of the earth
[1:05:34] she was Seated on the like
[1:05:42] this you
[1:05:44] see but when Jacob met when the heaven
[1:05:47] was open amen and they saw the Angels
[1:05:51] brother that settled everything
[1:05:55] Jacob
[1:06:00] knew and from that time started
[1:06:04] singing because he had encountered his
[1:06:07] maker he had an encounter with God Amen
[1:06:12] and the devil could not hold him any
[1:06:14] longer he was now a changed man he had
[1:06:18] courage to confront his brother amen
[1:06:21] after he said his family all his well
[1:06:24] and all failed God knew that Jacob
[1:06:27] needed open
[1:06:29] Heaven talk of Anna in the Bible she was
[1:06:33] troubled for
[1:06:35] years every time the the the call maybe
[1:06:39] she was giving birth every year it is
[1:06:41] possible women can give birth every
[1:06:46] year and she was giving birth every year
[1:06:49] maybe and Anna was there
[1:06:53] traed and erana was trying his best to
[1:06:56] play his
[1:06:57] part by giving her the bigger portion of
[1:07:00] each and everything that he gets but
[1:07:03] that could not satisfy Anna blessed be
[1:07:07] the name of the Lord her Joy was in a
[1:07:10] child praise be to God and Anna knew
[1:07:14] that something has to happen something
[1:07:17] must to be done many time when we look
[1:07:20] at our situation and take them for
[1:07:22] granted it will hold
[1:07:25] longer amen because you realize in your
[1:07:28] Christian Life that most time when you
[1:07:30] come out to react against Str that's
[1:07:32] when God comes
[1:07:34] down but when you just seated and it's
[1:07:37] okay with you brother even God will
