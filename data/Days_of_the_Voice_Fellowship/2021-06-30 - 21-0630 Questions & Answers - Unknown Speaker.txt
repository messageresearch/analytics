it because the quality of the video was not good and therefore i could not use it for uh the service this evening but uh uh otherwise i just want to welcome you uh i saw brother martin on here and his family but i think for some reason he's gone off uh but we will we will try to i think they might they might be having a network issue i hope that they will tune in on youtube uh i those who are on youtube god bless you and uh also uh you brother luanga your family god bless you and the saints who are here god bless you i just want to take a moment this evening and deal with the uh i want to deal with a few questions that were brought in uh from the bible study that we had on on tuesday uh i see that since the sisters are not here the sister stop is they are not here but i hope that they will be able either to stream this or to watch this later because some of these questions were from some of them uh i believe that the holy spirit will be able to take and direct these questions to the hearts of those that need it praise the name of the lord certainly i mean the answers to these questions now i've had i'll just go straight to this because uh i wanted to cover like at least two or two or three uh on tuesday one question was asked did john write everything in the book of revelation and we answered that then the other one is god eternal actually that was speaking with the godhead we also handled that then there is another question that that came up as well and this one says why does the devil hate genesis and revelation did we deal with that did we did we oh yeah we didn't why does the devil hate genesis and revelation okay now i'm going to begin with this and then i'll not dwell on this match but to those of you at home uh even those who are here i'm expecting that at least you should have a pen and paper where you can scribble down something with scripture that's something i might say and you want to uh to build on it later so that you can be able to study on it later it's always very important when you come for a service or for uh you know a session in the world to always have a parent paper by the way it's always very important so that you can always uh be able to follow very well now uh i want us to read genesis chapter 2 verse 17. if you wish to stand that's okay since since my uh gadget is down i'll remain seated so that you can be able to see me uh it says but of the fruit but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou it is thereof thou shalt surely die amen praise the name of the lord now i will begin with this this evening as uh you take your seats and uh it says but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die and the question was why does the devil hate genesis and revelation and of course in the message the revelation of jesus christ which is part of the church edge book i want to presume that most of you have already read that part i'm going to read the quote but the banham says have you ever noticed how saturn hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he is always attacking the book of genesis he's always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books he says we find saturn his origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he has to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is praise the name of the lord now i want you to to to look at this he says have you ever noticed how certain he hates two books in the in the bible more than all the others now that is not to me that all the other books are not inspired okay of course we have different bibles in the world today let me begin by talking about the bible we have different bibles in the world and when i say different bibles i mean both the versions as well as the types the major two different bibles one is the book the bible of six six books and another is the one of the 81 books maybe some of you did not even know that the bible of 81 books exists but the bible of the 81 books is the what we would call here in uganda the catholic bible or in the theater they would call it the orthodox bible and this is what they consider to be the true bible according to them but you see god by inspiration he was able to lead men during the time of the reformation of the church and inspired them for them to be able to know what is scripture and what was not inspired and just like he inspired men to write most of these books he would certainly inspire men to know which version or which scripture is inspired you understand what i'm talking about so now this they canonized this bible this the 66 book bible which we have which we read from and it too many they call it the protestant bible but it is a bible with six to six books and today we are not talking about that but what i wanted to say is that there are many proofs infallible proofs that prove that this 66 book bible is the authentic bible but also the 66 book bible the devil has also gone ahead to infiltrate it how has he done that the devil has tried to infiltrate the 66 book bible by causing it to be uh watered down and this bible has been watered down through the edges you know by the many different versions that the men have been making you know we have very many versions today the other day with you isaac we were trying to go through uh the differences between niv and kjv and i should say before i even continue to write bible that we would consider to be the right bible and would recommend for you to be able to read is the kjv king james version why because the kjv is the oldest 66 book bible that we know of and and also it is more clear than any other bible it's uh well they say it has the old elizabethan english of the thy the thou thee and things like that and so many people they say well it is hard to read it is hard to understand but what i want to tell you is it is not hard to read and it is not hard to understand as long as you give your heart to understanding it into reading it now what is more easier for you to under to try to read and see what it means or for you to take the watered-down versions and see the scriptures that are not even in the bible that some of them that are in the bible they are taken out and some of them that are not in the bible they are added in so as the children of god we must be able to know that the only right versions that we should read are those versions such as would agree with the major principles of scripture now if you have the niv or if you have one of those versions uh you can just i can give you one simple example and the other day we found very many certainly there are very many you can google it on the internet you'll find there are many differences between the kjv and many versions now these versions most of them are done by the denomination of people the theologians who try to disagree with many of the bible teachings and they try to incorporate their bible teachings into their theological teachings into the bible and many people are taken they're gullible and they're taken over they're overtaken by such a different versions that are not right now i wanted to look at one of them and that one of the verses that you can look at is a 1st john chapter 5 verse 7 first john chapter 5 verse 7. do you have another version does anyone have another version which is not kjv here any other version here in this house we had another version the other day do you have which version do you have huh someone has taken it can you please try to stop any movement around this area now uh let me ask to those of you who are online how many have a bible that is not kjv please raise up your hand so i can allow you to read for me this verse do you have a version of the bible that is not kjv no no okay okay no one has okay now maybe you can try to do that on your phone someone who has this bible on their phone just try to search first john 5 seven first john 5 7. first john 5 7 okay now i have first john 5 7 and i have it in both of the many versions here on my phone and i'm going to try and read it for you first in the kjv okay all right can you give it to me quickly first john 5 7 says do you have it can you read it for us for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the father the one the word and the holy ghost and these three and these three are one now that is we are waiting for you brother please that that is a first john first john 5 7. can you please help us brother you can sit there and try to do this first john 5 7. okay you have to try and be fast so that you can be able to uh be a blessing to the people that are streaming because if it's quite slow it doesn't help much okay now we have uh the verse there it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one can you give us verse eight and there are three that bear record on earth in earth bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one now can you give us both those verses seven and eight now verse seven the difference between verse seven and verse eight is that verse seven says that uh i need both of them on the screen at the same time so that we can be able to uh we can be able to compare verse seven is saying that there are three that bear witness rather record in heaven okay the ones in verse seven are in heaven and the ones in verse eight are on earth and then it says the ones in heaven they are one father son and holy spirit are one you you know you can't have the father without having the son and you can't have the son without having the holy ghost because these are one it's the same person but on verse eight it says that these three agree in one can you highlight that please these three agree in one now why does the bible say these three agree in one because they agree in one because they are not the same thing the the spirit and the water and the blood each of them are different a distinct and therefore that's why the bible says these three agree in one why because they are distinct they are different are you getting the idea here do you understand what i'm talking about those of you who are online you understand what i'm talking about it says that these three agree in one so now verse eight is talking about the word the spirit the water and the blood the spirit the water and the blood is actually talking about the sancti just justification sanctification and baptism of the holy spirit now water here symbolizes justification blood symbolizes sanctification and spirits in blood baptism of the holy spirit now this is these three were the three stages these are the three stages of grace and they all agree in one salvation now you are saved if you go through all that but now we see that verse seven is actually speaking on the uh the godhead okay the father the son and the holy spirit these are one okay they're not agreeing in one but they are actually one are you following that but when you look at niv verse seven for them is for there are three that testify full stop they stop there it doesn't bring out the whole point he doesn't even talk about anything verse seven is chopped off so if you're reading niv you literally have no understanding of the scripture you don't have that scripture at all so some of these bibles which are called bibles are as are school textbooks and theologia theological textbooks they are not really bibles that you can say their bibles and so that's why we really want to encourage our people to buy the kjv at least there you are certainly sure that you are going to have a proper expression of scripture and the question was about genesis and revelation and i wanted to first show you what bible to read which bible should you read which bible should you consider as the as the right bible and i wanted to say that please the right version of the bible is the 66 book version of the bi of the kjv bible and i'm sure that that will be a blessing to you if you can buy it and read it now of course even our luganda bible and many other languages it is not the correct translation many of the scriptures are chopped out they are following after the niv and other versions but nonetheless the word of god is the same and the word of god cannot be they can try to chop it out from their books but the word of god cannot be chopped out it is always the child of god will always find it praise the name of the lord so now we find out that uh the book of revelation and the book of genesis the devil hates it much and the reason why the devil hates it much the prophet has given us a reason if you can project that once again he said have you ever noticed how saturn has two books in the bible more than all others and it says he says that uh in it says the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books we find saturn we we find saturn his origin his awful ways and his destruction three things saturn is origin his awful ways and his destruction it is all the other books are inspired but in these two books genesis shows the beginning the origin of saturn and revelation shows his end or his destruction and and the scripture which i read in the book of genesis chapter 2 verse 17 shows us the origins it shows that saturn has that tree of knowledge of good and evil one person one day told me oh there we are true three trees in the middle of the garden and i told him what were those trees he said the first tree was the tree of knowledge the second tree was a tree of evil and the third tree was the tree of life i said no you need to read the scripture again what does it read give it to us again brother verse 17 but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in a day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die now can you give us that verse before the verse 17 come on scroll down to verse 16 and the lord god said commanded man the man saying of every tree of the god and thou may freely eat so how many trees were they all right now he says wait and the lord commanded man the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat now verse 16 is talking about the trees of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat now this here is talking about many trees including papaya including jackfruit including passion juices and everything that you know of the trees that you know of that bear those fruits now he says the trees from the fruits of those trees you can go ahead and eat okay can you give me verse 15. okay okay now i'm looking for another pass go down go down go down okay no no no no no i'm not looking for that can you find the tree of life uh let let's uh let's look at that closely not not not not right there genesis chapter 2 uh if you can open in your bibles genesis chapter 2 verse 8 verse 8 8 shows us all the trees very well and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground may the lord go to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and oh what are you doing can you verse okay verse eight and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed verse nine now here is a garden okay he has put man all right and verse nine and out of the ground made them lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant every tree that is pleasant to the site and good for food okay now did you see that full color in there please highlight that part the everett tree that is pleasing to the and good for food now that part which is talking of every tree that is pleasing to the site and good for food that's the part where he's talking about all the rest of the trees that we know today you can mention them can you give me some examples purple tree uh-huh mango tree huh orange tree uh-huh apple tree huh all those trees that are good and pleasing to the side and good for food okay now and he continues and he says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden now highlight this one the tree of life also in the midst of the garden now the tree of life is not a tree like purple tree this one now is talking about a person and this person because this one is used figuratively according to we will not go there but you can write the scripture down psalms chapter 1 he says that blessed is the man who walks not in the cast of the ungodly shall be like a tree planted by the waters but by the waters now we see that uh the tree usually in the scripture means person so the tree of life here is a person and this person is the person of christ it's god himself who was the tree of life and where was he in the middles of the garden now we continue on and he says and the tree so now this is the third tree this is the third category and a tree of knowledge of good and evil now the tree of knowledge was one tree but this tree of knowledge had two elements in it the first thing was good and the last words evil so what was that okay now of course i'm not dwelling much on this and i just wanted to just show you an idea here but maybe when we are talking on the serpent seed we shall be able to go in details and talk about it but i wanted to give you a little understanding here that there are three categories of trees that were in the garden of eden the first category of the trees that was in the garden of eden was the first category was the trees that were good for food number one the second category was the trees that was called the tree of life that was one tree and that i told you means god and the third category was the tree of knowledge now the tree of knowledge and the tree of life were both in the middle of the garden now the tree of knowledge that was the devil the serpent and uh of course there are many scriptures we support this but like i said i'm not going into the depth of the study for that one for today if you have any further questions about this you can send them on and we shall take it on later but i wanted to show you that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is the devil that the bible also says maybe you can search out that quickly and get it for me it says that thou were what perfect in his ways he was perfect in his ways until iniquity was found in him okay let me let me try to find i think it is in the book of ezekiel okay uh if you can open it up together with me ezekiel chapter 28 get there quickly ezekiel ezekiel chapter 28 okay now i want i will read just a few verses to emphasize on this point it's it's a very long reading so allow me to read only from verse seven okay ezekiel chapter 28 verse 7 behold there i therefore i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall drown their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring forth verse 8 they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain in the midst of the sins verse 9 wilt thou yet say before him that saith thee i am god but thou shalt be a man and no god in the mind of of him that slave thee thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of the strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god moreover the word of god the lord came unto me saying son of of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus now the king of tyra's probably this could have been existed but also the king of terrorists is figurative here to talk uh or to refresh the devil lucifer and as he continues to describe the king of terrors you will notice he's not a man okay you'll notice that this is more than a man he was an angel he was a carob in heaven but then of course because of uh uh of backsliding you know he was he became the devil take up a lamentation upon the king of terrorists and say unto him that saith the lord god thou seriously have the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty perfect in beauty not that one thou has been in head in the garden of god he has also been in eden right every preacher stone was thy covering the sardia stoppers and diamond and burial and honks and jasper and saffron emerald and the cabana and god the workmanship of thy tablets and the pipes was prepared in the in the day that thou was created so now we notice here that this was not born he's not a man who was born but this was something that was in the garden of eden number one number two he was perfect in beauty number three he was created okay now number 14 verse 14 he says thou art the anointed cherub that covers okay now he continues on to also say he is not only created he was not only perfect in beauty he is not only in the garden of eden but also he was the anointed angel kero of course we know there are many types of angels there there are caribs there are there are some suffers and they are also the the normal angels the main types of angels but for him he was not just any type he was a kid he was a general in this angelic angelica real my mind we can just go ahead and study all through but um i wanted you to see verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in thee now okay we don't have it here by the shame now the bible here is saying that this carob was perfect perfect can you say perfect and then what else was there apart from perfection iniquity can you say iniquity so here is something that is perfect but also having iniquity it has good and evil and who is he that has good and evil in him it is a tree of knowledge where was the tree of knowledge in the middle of the garden and we find out that the devil lucifer according to ezekiel 28 he was also in the garden of eden so we have no question at all whatsoever that this lucifer was actually the devil himself that this tree of knowledge was actually the devil himself right that is his origin and if you go in the in the depth of that teaching you understand that the devil was able to infiltrate the serpent and the serpent was able to bring forth its seed in into the human and mingle it with a human race and from that time things went wrong and from that time sin came in and we cannot know that unless we know what the bible says in the book of genesis it is genesis that reveals the beginnings and the origin of saturn but also revelation reveals and shows the end of saturn and these two books they never hates it to the extent that many people today in the churches do not read these books why because they have no understanding of them these two books cannot be understood fully without a prophet you would need because look these two books were not written without a prophet but these two books were written we got out to use prophets for example genesis let me ask you a question who wrote the book of genesis god bless you praise the lord now we just got interrupted here but we're back on now so i was trying to explain the point here that uh in the beginning at the first time it was actually in genesis that it reveals the origin of saturn and genesis actually is the the book that many people do not read and the reason they don't read it is simply because they don't have the understanding of it even when they really they read really a few things of course they haven't they they can try to explain and some of them like they read like poems but the understanding of of the book of genesis like god brought it through our prophet who was not even there in the same way god would bring the understanding or the revelation of it by the holy spirit through uh oh by the by a prophet through the holy spirit the help of the holy spirit and so we see that uh the book of revelation same thing god has to send a a man uh to the isle of patamus john for him to be able to see things to hear things and then to be able to write it down jesus christ himself wrote the book of j of of j of revelation uh using john and john was a prophet so we see that in the same way we will need a prophet to be able to understand the book of revelation amen amen now let us look at a a few things here i'll just read you one more quote about this i think what i've explained in this question is enough but let me read for you one quote here it says the roman catholics say it's from the church 8 book the roman catholics say that the church is built upon peter oh am i in another question i think i'm in another question excuse me okay i was supposed to read something else here yes yeah here we are uh i'll take this from the ephesian church age he says if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of good and evil is also a person it can't it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the garden of eden you know it is amazing the righteous one and the evil one stood what side by side and even today also in the same church there should be those two seats i've mentioned on that before therefore even in exactly what we've already read ezekiel 28 13 where he says thou saten thou which means satan has been in the garden in eden the garden of god and he says here is where we receive the true revelation of the serpent's seat here is what really happened in the garden of aden the word says that eve was be grieved by the serpent she was actually seduced the serpent so we can be able to get into that in more detail later but now we realize from these two books genesis and revelation that genesis shows the origin of saturn and revelation shows its end of course it is in the book of revelation chapter 20 verse 10 that says and the devil that deceived them that was cast into the lake of that and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever so the devil was cast into the lake of fire we see his end right there in the book of revelation but how can we uh uh receive this revelation of what really happens and takes place even in the book of revelation what the devil is trying to do through the ages you know through the the horse riders the bible speaks of the horse riders the false writers how the devil you know the devil ascended the same devil you know by changing colors coming over on on and on to persecute the church the depth the book of revelation reveals that and of course you can't understand that without a god sent prophet and that's why we should thank god for answer for loving this generation and sending us a message praise the lord amen okay now we have another question here uh and this question says somebody asked and said okay i don't know if we should deal with this i think we can [Music] okay it's just brief we'll deal with it it says why does the rock stand for revelation why does the rock stand for revelation and i wanted to answer this by approaching it from matthew 17 matthew 16 17 which says and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon but jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build what and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so we notice that there is a church that christ said he will build but after he had asked who he was and everybody was giving an answer on who he was then simon peter said thou art christ the son of the living god of course we talked about that so we know that some of the living word means god in flesh right so now once peter received that revelation jesus definitely knew where he had picked the revelation from he says for flesh and blood has not done what revealed these things unto you but my father in heaven has revealed it can you convert that together for flesh and blood has not read that again has not no no you're reading it very lazily has not revealed it unto thee flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee now remember he's talking about a revelation in other words peter what of course peter the word peter means a little rock so now many people many people think that the the church was built on peter but no he says thou art peter and upon this rock he's not saying that peter this rock you peter no but he's trying to say flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father in heaven has revealed it and upon this rock and brother banamiya gives the answer and he says the roman catholic said that the church is built upon peter but now that is really canon how could god build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the lord jesus and cast while doing it god can't do this church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though god had hollowed the ground at that spot yes and it isn't as the pentecostals the protestants say that the church is built upon jesus jesus is not even here today so if the church was built upon jesus you know what they did they they went and took the the body of peter batted it under do the big church call it saint peter's basilica so now this is the church the only teacher he's not talking about the body of jesus he's not even talking about peter but he says it was the revelation read it the way it is written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father has revealed it and upon this rock meaning upon this revelation ask yourself what revelation upon the revelation that you peter have of who jesus christ is upon the revelation of jesus christ peter heard of him hallelujah the church of jesus christ is built upon the revelation of jesus christ the church of jesus christ is built upon a revelation that peter had of jesus and what was that revelation that god himself has come in place hallelujah god has come in flesh that is the revelation god is as put on flesh and is dwelling among us that is the revelation so now what is the rock the rock is a revelation of who jesus christ is no man can go into the rapture unless they have understood or received the revelation of who jesus christ is and upon this revelation upon this rock i will build my church the church is built on the revelation on the thus saith the lord the church is built on who jesus christ is and jesus christ who is he he is hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever which means it has not changed but if he just said the church was built upon jesus hallelujah hey wait a moment jesus does not live in the world today physically speaking so does it mean the church is dead no the church is continuing but the church is built upon the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ the revelation that peter had and you two must receive that revelation no one is going to go in the rapture unless you receive that revelation of jesus christ being the same yesterday today and forever praise the name of the lord amen i think that answers that question okay now there is one question i was really trying to get was trying bad to get to eat and uh because this question is going to answer three questions in one and people asked this question some sisters they asked this question um and they said one question says can one have the holy ghost when he is not baptized can one have the holy spirit when he is not baptized some people are saying here no are there anyone saying yes can you have the holy spirit when you're not baptized or before you are baptized some people are saying yes others are saying no okay some people are saying yes now even those who are saying no are saying yes so i don't know you don't know you do not know what to believe okay then the other question which i want to ask here which i want to also say because it rhymes with the others there are two more one said the books mainly tell us to receive the holy ghost so that we can understand something some things can be revealed to us but now how does the holy ghost get to us how does the holy ghost get to you how do you receive the holy spirit okay now question numbers uh well i have it here as number seven now but it is still the same uh uh on the same line he said are there any other reason is there i think are there any other reasons why we are immersed in water during baptism apart from it being for a good conscience toward god of course this sister might have read or must have read this from the church edge book uh actually she might have quoted for me the place where she read it let me pick up a question quickly here in a moment well uh she quotes that being from uh can you pick it up for me someone see you with it read for me uh page uh page paragraph two page 28 paragraph two that's where she gets that uh she gets that portion and i think i also might have put it somewhere around here okay uh i think i'll read it later because i have that portion of it but maybe those of you want to underline it and see so remember those questions are three because you don't have a microphone there right so now the the the questions are three the first question is can one have the holy ghost when he is not baptized or i should even add one is not baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ because someone can be baptized but wrongly and what are the examples of wrong baptism the examples of wrong water baptisms are the following one you might be baptized in water but you were baptized against your will that's not considered as baptism number two you might be baptizing water but when you are when you are when you do not know what was happening you you were you were baptized but you did not know what was happening you did not make your own decision someone else made it the decision for you that too is not water baptism number three you might be baptized in much water even in the name of jesus christ but actually you uh uh did not these two things have said you didn't make the decision you didn't know what was happening uh maybe you're too young to understand or maybe you do not uh you know so you you you really wanted you didn't know what what you believed then and uh you didn't practically make the decision by yourself you you did not repent of your sins therefore that does not concern as a as baptism because it has to be something that you have made up your own choice now the other wrong example of baptism is when someone is baptized in much water but they are not baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ that too is not considered to be true water baptism now also there are those who have placed babies that too is not considered as a right or whatever baptism so the question is regardless of whether you are baptized in the right name or in the wrong way the question is i don't want to look at the wrong way i want to look at the right way before you are baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ can you receive the holy ghost that's the question i believe and some people said no another said yes and the other question says now how can the holy spirit get to you the other question was like uh is there any other reason for baptism apart from being it being an answer to good conscience before god now i thought these are very interesting questions and i think we should deal with them as well now i'm going to begin by reading acts chapter 2 verse 37 try it again now it says now when they had this i'm reading verse 37 now when they had this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of what sins and he shall do what receive the holy ghost the gift to the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call now the conclusion that everybody will have will be you know you see the bible says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for your sins to be washed away and fully receive the spirit the holy spirit so can you receive the holy spirit before you baptized no how come because he said repent then be baptized then your sins are washed away then you receive the holy ghost but i do not want you to look at it that way i want you to look at it this way the bible did not say that they should receive baptism first it wasn't baptism in itself with a baptism in itself that gave them the holy ghost are you following me what does the bible say the bible says rep because nana you need to understand this and i need to give it as a disclaimer now because we do water baptism and many people think oh i am being baptized to be saved water baptism does not wash away your sins scripture has said it and we will quote it if you have your bible if you have a pen and paper and you want to write it down and you read it later please do in the book of uh first peter chapter three verses uh 21 the like figure we're unto even baptism does also save now save us so peter says baptism now does what serves us but does it really literally mean that the water that you are baptized in is going to wash your sins away no no way he is trying to say baptism serves us how by the he says not the putting away of the field of the flesh it doesn't wash away your sins like you go to wash because you are nothing no do not have the old testament concept of naman going to watch his reprocessing but he says it's not washing away of the putting away the filter of the flesh but it says it is the answer of a good conscious toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ so baptism in itself does not save us it doesn't give us the holy ghost in itself now notice i'd not say but we cannot we can receive the holy ghost without baptism but i said baptism as the act in itself does not wash the person's sins and does not give the person the holy ghost but what does follow me closely the bible says repent tell them what it is what should we do he didn't say baptize yourselves and you'll see the holy ghost but it says repent that's the very first thing so the first thing to do for everyone that wants to receive the holy ghost is to do what to repent but now the question then comes what is repentance can someone who has not believed repent no can you repent without believing no you repent of your sins after hearing the gospel believing the gospel then you repent so what comes fast is faith after faith comes repentance after repentance then comes the works of faith and then after the works of faith then comes the holy ghost okay now but here the best is here is faith let us uh look at mark 16 as we examine this a little further verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every christian he that does what he that is baptized shall be saved does it say that come on now answer me what does it say he that does what believeth fast believing never forget that or else if it was baptism that is giving people the holy ghost and salvation will just simply be going and collecting every people on the roads and you tell them let's go for water baptism we push them some of them we kick them like like noah kicked easy people to go in the act we are not going to kick anyone to go for water baptism if you were kicked to go for a baptism you have to do it over again if you really feel that you should do it if you really believe the very first thing that you must do my brother is to believe if you have not believed you are not a candidate for what a baptism if you are not a believer you are not a candidate for baptism okay so believing fast and then is baptized then shall be saved okay let us go on on to another verse romans chapter 10 because how do you believe that that's another question okay how do you believe them do you believe because your parents are believers or do you believe because your mother or friend or sister whatever is a believer no romans 10 verse 13 please follow me please follow me closely now these are very very good points for whosoever shall toll i wish i had somebody who was reading for me the scriptures now whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved hallelujah whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord the bible says the scripture says shall be the same oh i thought the bible said that he was whoever believeth and his baptism shall be saved so then how come that you only need to call upon the name of the lord and you will be saved no wait a moment can you call on the one that you do not know he even continues to say how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed so you cannot recall on the name of the lord unless you are believed so it's not like saying i don't believe but i just built i just i just love jesus i love jesus jesus save me because i sing and i have a nice voice and i can jump up and down and speak in tongues i i will go on with my persecution and everything but just save me because i've called upon your name no when he's saying calling upon the name of the lord he is saying calling upon the name of the lord with the understanding also with the faith also you understand yes the bible says that at the mention of the name of jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord and now his name is the name above every name and everybody shall now listen does it mean that everybody even if they don't believe they just mention jesus and then they are healed no no way it is accompanied with faith okay you don't just say jesus serve me jesus human then it just happens because you mentioned the name of jesus jesus must be mentioned with faith like that man came to jesus and he told him please i believe you go and uh just mention the word and my child will be well just mention the word and my child will be well that man believed and because he believed he had faith when he mentioned the name jesus it did something for him so it's all about faith it's not about just speaking i don't want okay you know how shall they call in whom on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not had and how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent you see as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for it said that this was our report so then faith comes by what by hearing and hearing by what the word of god okay now i see you brother somewhere i think the family there you are struggling with the zoom if zoom is not working for you to have continuity of thought it's very good for you to go to youtube so you can be able to follow along well and you don't miss out on this because the people who ask that question might want to hear the answers to this we don't want to just cut cut the thought you want to be able to follow now are you seeing the progression of this first is calling upon the name of the lord number one if you call in the name of the lord you are what you will be saved number one number two how can you call on him unless you believe so then you must believe before you call in the name of the lord but then how can you believe without hearing the gospel of being pretty fast so then before you believe you have first hear someone preaching but then how can you hear someone preaching unless someone has been sent to you all right so then you must hear someone who is sent not just anyone that i had a drunkard speaking and then i believe no it must be someone sent but then how can he be sent how can he preach except he be sent to understand so now you need to sit under a ministry of the preaching of the word by someone that has been sent by god and then when you hear the word being preached and you believe it and you accept it then and only then can you say i have believed it all right after believing it and making your decision then and only then can you call on the name of the lord and how do you call in the name of the lord you call in the name of the lord by confessing your sins how do you confess your sins you say i accept i'm a sinner i accept the lord as my lord and savior and from today i have decided to follow him and accept him as lord and savior of my life and when the moment you do that the moment you do that is the moment that you are ready now for water baptism you are not ready for water baptism until that time if you were baptized before you made that decision oh let me tell you you are not baptized you have to be baptized over again because water baptism in itself people think oh let me just go in the water so i i can be saved no water doesn't wash away your sins water doesn't give you the holy ghost but water is only an answer to for a good conscience before god it is something to identify you with christ in his death body and resurrection water is something that uh that activates your faith or rather that proves your faith so first the important thing for you before you receive the holy ghost is having faith in god and how can you faith in god how can you have faith in god unless you have had the gospel being preached and how can you hear the gospel being preached with unless you sit under someone preaching it you can't say i'll just read it myself and then i understand no you have to sit under the preaching of the word and after sitting under the preaching of the word and you make a decision then that preacher baptizes you all right okay now let us take this even a little bit further james chapter 2 verse 17 says james chapter 2 17 okay just a moment here we have a problem uh with uh with someone coming on who is not muted okay now let us uh look at this scripture in gems it says even so faith if it has not worked is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have words show me thy faith without thy words and i will show thee my faith by my words hallelujah amen thou believers that there is one god and that was where the devils also they believe and they tremble but without all knowing man that faith without works is they never too can can speak jesus they never talk and believe that there is one god so everybody says i believe there is god in heaven yeah ever even they never believe that is good in heaven but you your faith must go to an extent whereby you do something to prove that you have faith in god you must put it to work you must put your faith to work and how do you put your faith to work by water baptism you are you can read romans 6 1 and 6 from one on down to six and you will say that indeed faith uh shows you are uh that you believe but you must show it by your watch now i want to see a scenario here and before i do let us first try to make a reconstruction of this so the question was can i receive the holy ghost before i'm baptized and the answer is yes you can receive the holy ghost the moment you believe the moment you have faith in god what gives you faith in god rather what gives you the holy ghost is faith and what gives you faith is the word of god and what what is the word of god the word of god is that which we preach you must believe it and part of it is that is baptism in water in the name of our lord jesus christ okay but the action whether you have done or not yet done it where you might be baptizing water in the name of our lord jesus christ when you don't really believe with all your heart can you agree many people get baptized and by the balance says they are like dry sinners going getting into dry and coming out wet but they are still sinners it didn't change a bit it isn't the water that serves people can be baptized and still go to hell so really it is your faith there are some people who will be baptized they get the holy ghost immediately and those who will be baptized and they don't get it and there are those who will get it even before they go in the water so it is to do with the condition of your heart it is to do with whether god it is only god who decides whether to give you the holy ghost or not and what touches god is only one thing faith in god and now does that certainly mean that well as long as you have faith in god you've got heaven even if you are not baptized in water in the name of our lord jesus christ oh the very reason why you ask that question is because you don't have faith yet because anybody with the holy ghost will never ask such a question anybody with the holy ghost will never ask whether or not they need to be baptized after hearing that they need to be blessed i'll show you an example here coronarius acts chapter 10 verse 44. stand there with me why peter yet speak these words peter was still preaching hallelujah peter was still talking like i'm talking right now and the holy ghost fell on all them which had the word the holy ghost it fell on them were they baptized that's my question but the political were they baptized yet were they baptized sister john tell us maybe you know this better these people may not know where these people baptize where is john is she's somewhere around there we're looking at acts chapter 10 where these people baptized yet or not we didn't hear your answer what whatever it is that you answered we need to hear brother peter mother peter where are these people baptized yet because the bible says that as peter was still speaking these words the holy ghost came on them so the question is were they baptized yet no they were not yet they were not yet baptized okay god bless you all right now if the holy ghost came on them and they will not get baptized now does it doesn't go against acts chapter 2 the formula because the formula should be you you you you are baptized then you receive the holy ghost so my point i was trying to show you is baptism in itself doesn't give you the holy ghost what gives you the holy ghost is your faith in god and that faith comes by hearing the word the right word that is why before someone is baptized they must first hear they must first hear and they must believe after believing and only and only then can they be baptized if someone is baptized before believing they are not baptized rightly and they must get back in the water and be baptized in the right way so peter was still speaking and he was under the holy ghost hallelujah and he was speaking and the holy ghost came upon all of them which had what the word which had the word and the they of the circumcision which believed were astonished the brothers and sisters were astonished even the holy spirit can come on drunkards as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was powered out the gift of the holy ghost for they had them speak with the tanks and magnify god then answered peter hey peter was peter was challenged he said ah these people they had never seen it on any believers the holy ghost coming one day this is challenging it's quite challenging and what did peter do peter did what no disciple has ever done read your bible over and over again in the bible there is no one who has ever asked anyone to be baptized it was always the one who is hearing the gospel who asked can i be baptized please can you take me to be baptized there is no pastor in the bible who has ever asked anyone come i baptize you no one only apostle peter and peter has quite a character on him quite a nature you remember even on the day of pentecost it was him who told them but that was after they asked him can any man forbid water that this should also should not be baptized we shall receive the holy ghost as we have can anyone any man forbid water from them can any man say they shouldn't be baptized can anybody say they shouldn't be baptized can any sister say they shouldn't be baptized like us because they'll see the holy ghost like us then listen verse 48 and he commanded them he did not request them he did not ask them he did not compel them he commanded everybody to say he commanded he commanded come on now you can serve much better than that he commanded them to be what never he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed him then they they asked him to wait for to be there for some days now listen friends paul told them oh you have received the holy ghost he told him hey wait wait wait come come here first get into this water i love that hallelujah oh man i just feel like preaching now he told them yes you are speaking tongues you are filled with the holy ghost you are anointed but come and get into the water we shall know by this whether you are believers or not you see so whether someone claims to have the holy ghost or not if they reject the word it is a clear sign they never had the holy ghost to begin with it's like a clear sign ghost and there are for my friends we must always taste every spirit and by the bottom gave us a good way of testing every spirit is by the word you give it a word test a word test when you give anything a wordy test then and only then can you know whether that thing is right with god whether that thing is of the holy ghost hallelujah now i'll give you a few quotes to confirm what i've been telling you and then i think i'll close with this because uh we have covered enough i think for today i think about four questions if you have not seen the first ones please you after the this you will just go back to youtube and watch it off if you want to share it with a friend you can go ahead and do that now and how can they claim to be a prophet now of course i'm reading from the way of a true prophet how can they claim to be a prophet of the lord and deny the very word of god how can a man baptize in the name of the father son and holy ghost them titles and deny the very name of jesus christ when it is not a scripture in the bible not to support their theory i may be hard and critical but it's the time to get that way it's the truth how can the people claim themselves to be christians today and running out here to everything and women and with bobby hair and wearing shorts and smoking cigarettes and running to uh the picture shows he means the movies there to everybody any kind of an old show and coming on tell me that that's the holy ghost tell me is that the holocaust am i talking to people or am i talking to no no don't you never tell me that you make god sick at his stomach if there was such a thing could be done yeah i'm sure you understand call yourself such as that how can there be such a thing but they are fruits you shall know them by their fruits you are now let me tell you even in these pentecostal churches which say they have the holy ghost with these things they are doing which grieve the holy ghost women in trousers in many clothes with all they are carrying on the way they were dressing in the nightclubs is the way they are dressing when they come in the church with their mini skirts with their lipsticks and they all they how many kilograms of of of painting on their face and everywhere you see you think god doesn't mind god minds about every word he puts in his bible and therefore they come in their churches and all these them a certified man of god why do they why do i call them 65 because they do not hold the word of god the way it is they hold it with the gloves you try to preach the bible calls them many pleasers you know and then they come in with their dances and they they pull the stops of the world and they begin dancing to please people you know worship these days is no longer worshipping the churches it is entertainment it is entertainment they are singing to entertainer to entertain and that kind of thing let me tell you even in the pentecostals a child of god filled with the holy ghost there cannot be happy with such a thing as that i was in hawasa i preached the message to a brother and this brother is the one who recorded those videos that you saw us posting and he was in this big big church prophetic church kind of called and he said he was this is his testimony he told me he was always telling them how can you claim that this is a church when you are doing what you are doing and this is a man who was before he received the christ he was going in a bar every night in these nightclubs he was all painted he has even the tattoos and everything on his body he has enjoyed life so-called so he came out from there and he said i was shocked when i came to the church the way the women who are being we're addressing there is the way they were dressing in the church and to make matters worse the same women that i would i would be i i was seeing that there are customers in the nightclubs because i know them i was there i was serving them they are the same women coming in the church and dressed the same way dancing the same dances so night clubs have become churches you see and they still claim to be tango talking and the demon chasing and having the holy ghost so judge by yourself is that the holy ghost no it is not that young a man he was among them his heart was not happy why because he was having the holy ghost even before being baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ and when he came to us the holy ghost let him look the bible says when he the spirit of truth shall come what will he do tell me somebody he said when he the spirit of truth shall come he will guide you into all truth so the holy ghost guided this brother he was hungering he was crying he was desiring for the holy ghost to come and speak to him but you see the holy ghost even led him to somebody that can give him the word hallelujah and when he received it he immediately told them i want to be baptized and we took him in the lake and he baptized him immediately he ran he went to his home he preached to his sister he preached to his mother they also came they said we wanted to and they are baptized what is it many of these were already filled with the holy ghost many of these were tank talking and demon chasing but they were among those churches which were not teaching the right truth so you see if you have the holy ghost no matter you can receive the holy ghost no matter where you are but the holy ghost is not sin because you're talking tongues the holy ghost is sin if you are bearing the feuds of the world that's how you you know that somebody's fueled the holy ghost if they bear the fruits of the world and and you cannot have the holy ghost and deny the truth never you can never die because the holocaust in you is that truth it's the same thing so how can he deny his own one can he he can't and and uh and then let me try to read this quote uh finish up this quote now this is another quote actually uh from the message uh god is provided away i'll read that and one more two quotes and then i i'm going to close with that i have to say this but i'm going to have to look and when you take women i'll i'll save it for one thing that's visible can see that claim to have the holy ghost and not decent enough to leave their hair grow can you imagine women claiming up the holy ghost and they're cutting their hair when the bible clearly states that if a sister cut or if a woman cuts her hair she shouldn't even come before the lord in prayer imagine very clear in the scriptures that she don't even listen enough to grow their hair there is something wrong somewhere a woman that will put on a garment that pertains to a man and wear it when the bible says it's an abomination to god for a woman to wear a garment pertains to a man and then you claim to have the holy ghost and do that he continues on actually that was from the message and i said shall possess the gate of their enemy i i joined it together here so i did not notice but then i'll continue here with god this provided way he says now remember you are just you are just accepted christ now god will give you the holy ghost in confirmation of your faith can everyone say that god will give you the holy ghost in confirmation of your faith you see it it's your faith that god gives you the holy ghost to on that basis now you get to some good full gospel church and be baptized right away you see after he is telling them after you've got the holy ghost according to your faith then run it away run and go and get baptized sometimes by the battle would say raise up your hands how many one they wanna go scare raise up your hand you pray for them they receive the holy ghost now run go to a church that baptizes in the right way in the name of our lord jesus christ and get baptized so you see it it is it's all the same thing and god is under obligation to give you the baptism of the holy ghost the moment you're baptized again it says well now the moment you are baptized god is under obligation to give you the holy ghost you cannot receive the holy ghost unless you are you are his and what confirms you that you are his is when you have a praise in his name and then now you can you can demand for it you can ask for it because then it is yours because it is a promise but even then it is him who gives he can give it to you at any time as long as you believe and have faith enough to receive it and and is under obligation to give it to you once you're baptized if you come with a true heart believing peter said just repent and be baptized and he shall receive the gift of the holy ghost god promised it now he would make everything right praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah so saints god still gives people the holy ghost and if you have baptized in a wrong way and we found out what are the wrong ways when you were if you were forced if you were asked if you were coerced into it and it wasn't your decision it wasn't your decision you did not know what you believed you never repented of your sins then you need to do it the right way that's what we have seen and found out in the scripture and i think i've answered all the other questions with that one that's how the first one was saying uh can you receive the holy ghost before baptism yes sure you can but if you have the true holy ghost then that word was must push you to go and be baptized in the in the right way in the name of our lord jesus christ praise the lord then then the other question was saying what i was saying what i want to try it or or just to give a basic answer for each of them then the other question was saying how does the word goes to get to you the oil goes against you as soon as you have faith and how does he come he can come in any way he chooses to but you see the way when he comes in your heart you do not say yeah that's the holy ghost all right but because i shouted you know he comes in and how you know when the child is being born does anyone see that ah there it is the life is coming the life is coming right there it has come it has now come in do you really see it you don't get to see the life coming but you know you only see the reaction of the life after just come so you see someone can shout dance be happy feel joy of the lord and all that kind of thing or think that it must happen it should happen to someone who has received life but you see that comes only because you have received the life but also we know the devil can impersonate it really so we cannot put the holy ghost on their breasts because someone spoke in tongues or was happy or shouted and danced that then we know that they are filled no it must be that their life agrees with the word of god they have the fruit that they have and then the other question was saying and are there any other reason why we are immersed in water during the baptism apart from being for a good yes yes there are many reasons one it identifies you in the death and barrier of our lord jesus christ according to romans chapter six and then also uh it says for the remission of your sins you see you share your faith by your works and if you believe and have faith in god then your sins will be forgiven but you say how do you have faith in god how do you know you have faith in god by by by your works by your works you show your faith in god and when you're baptized in water the bible says your sins are forgiven are washed away by what not by the water but by the blood of our lord jesus christ by that action you have done because that action symbolizes when you're baptized in that name it is the name which has the power to connect you with the blood and then your sins are remitted or washed away then also the baptism uh indeed uh is a show of our faith and the bible says he that be
