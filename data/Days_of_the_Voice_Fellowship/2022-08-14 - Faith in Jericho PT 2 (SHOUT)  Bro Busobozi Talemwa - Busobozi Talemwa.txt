a perfect chat praise the name of the lord amen i mean i also want to thank you for prayers i i had a good trip to karamoja thursday and we were able to get another brother to replace him to amen um a song shout out to the lord but if you can give us the lyrics and then as we finish that song we shall go to the book of joshua before we get seated i'd like us to sing that song it's just an inspiration of what i'm going to speak about this morning [Music] jesus my savior lord there is none like you [Music] all of my days i want to see the wonders of your mind [Applause] [Music] [Music] all that i am [Music] all [Music] mountains fall down the sound of your name [Music] you forever [Music] shout to the lord [Music] [Applause] of your name i sing for joy the work of your hands yes [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] with you [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music] i want to see you this morning would you ask him would you ask him to touch you oh yes yes [Music] [Music] [Music] me and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i believe you shout then shall you shout yes [Music] i've been speaking on the subject of faith and uh we did we spoke on the sixth sense success is he is even now jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever yes we also spoke on the battle is the lord is um and that's what we are doing this morning faith in jericho we spoke on uh the woman rahab try okay and the spies that had come to jericho never questions the spies that came out from the camp of the israelites and they had come to jericho to spy the land and there was no person there that really understood who these people were and why they came out for only a woman who actually happened to be a prostitute attended [Music] so i we realized by the bottom say that faith is actually the revelation of the will of god you see faith is not something you walk up oh cooking is a city in kitchenware corridor it's not something you say i pray too much to get faith switching to children and saying something is fast too much to get faith deceiving you for no and we know there are on prayer mountains and fast for days and days and months and months but we realized from the subjects we've been going through the attracted to summer to take it down [Music] oh i saw the [Music] of his baby animal babies because it was revealed to him but what god said is true and it is coming to pass the woman that my mother my father my brother my sister and everyone in my family who told her that these people were coming to destroy me not prevail against him so now what is this wrong this rock is not uh some people say it was jesus others say you know this rock was uh uh you know um they say it was uh you know you know jesus because jesus was the rock and the catholic church was jesus it says that jesus was buried there and therefore the catholic church is built upon that rock upon that faith rather upon upon peter therefore the catholic church is that church which jesus was speaking to was actually the revelation of who jesus christ is who do men say that i am i run toward you and say some say you are elijah and then he said what about you what do you say that i i the son of man and peter upon the revelation of who yeah queen somebody that means you're gone if you're not if you go through fire and you do not burn it means you're gold oh you shout out okay then now you can shout out now i want us to see the background of this statement now jericho now jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thy hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor yes sir if god has revealed to you what is yours there were already people living there there were jb styles and god told his people through abraham i have given you this life now you remember as they were coming everything to be seen we can't make it that's what i wanted it's better for us to go back to egypt where can it today in my city so that we uh so that we can be able to eat the onion i want not to tomato and the garlic new jew and the meat and this did not please god be no nebuchadnezzar you know the world can give you garlic in your mouth but they will give you also suffering cannot stand aside tell you [Music] cannot be reduced let me tell you actually the ones who came from egypt arrived in this city and entered into the promised land they were ingrained since from the old generation there were only two people that was joshua why did they make it right with fools i think i don't have a serious and i'm going to sign you that's the scripture now is your child when you kill me now listen to me church don't put it in the can you say so these children of his rights who are now born they were raised by the by a new generation we are going to go and take the life again again and when they reached that the brink of that land with all of our concern there was something between them and the land and that was just charged me because it was really about what i was going through the same charges god was still the same category the god of moses is the god of joshua never changes let me tell you the gentiles [Applause] in the flesh and he came to save us the land is real hallelujah hallelujah and we see that this just generation is how women but i want you to see what i want to see and then it concludes by saying the woman is here is her coverage [Applause] god respects abandoned as they were going to cross the jordan river they realized that they had the ark of the conference god respects his wife why didn't god consider them right you cannot ever falcon because these people one of them had faith there were children of abraham and because of that they had to claim to possess my hallelujah hallelujah amen these people knew i don't know anybody but nothing would stop them from they knew they would stop at nothing everybody again the person is that nothing will stop there foreign we need to learn we again we need to know together what our promises are put together of your faith we are children of god let me tell you is is able to do that even today if you receive the revelation then you begin claiming your promises i will never encounter these of you and i want to tell you our promises the message of the hour is ours why can't we just say that what faith hallelujah amen all the promises of the book is ours is is no matter what the devil tries to stand in the world if others want miracles we there he be no amount of failure any foreign hallelujah amen the devil cannot succeed the devil has given somebody to some people help me this morning let us return it to him hallelujah amen i'm sorry i came this morning determined my son you were there next to myself i am not going to forgive the day of singing and standing on you have to give him enough clothes hallelujah amen because we know our promises who we are we are children of abraham by faith hallelujah i mean oh the word is sin oh questions these things [Music] rise in the name of the lord [Applause] foreign let me tell you there is nothing too hard for god that don't have seen any religion never described on any part of that i think a man gets sick he is greater than all i have seen that you're now and when he gives his promise to the victims my sister praise the name of the lord and he says that's right again judge truth to glorify god and receive of his spirit and his blessings goodness i got turned demons knows hallelujah unto israel the more you believe that trash joe come foreign no because i am [Music] won't offend you but i love this shirt in the house of the lord i love a shout out victory a shout out to people about revelations let us go through the strategy the strategy of to defeat and possess jericho cathy jericho is the devil yeti let's type it that way did you find another way you want to destroy jericho oh yeah but also you want to possess it there's something in there that belongs to you yeah the world and the riches thereof is of the lord but we don't possess it the way it is we want to possess in the right way mongerian truth we don't want to possess by bribery the dragon i want to see everybody's giving a bribe to god into how you possess every introduction some people believe that without braving they can never be employed who tells you that yeah and i condemn him yes you can get a job or something phenomenal even without driving without cheating without stealing without killing gotta say you can make it in school but without necessarily treating examples it is possible possess jericho yeah in the right form let us look at verse 3. in chapter 6 of joshua yes and he shall compass the city and all ye men of war and go around about the city once thus shall now do six days and they and seven peace shall bear before the act seven trumpets of ram's horns and the seventh day he shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the roundhorn and when you hear the sound of the trump all the people shall shout with a great shot i love that bad part and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up my goodness i mean every man straight before him read that question three three to five era they were to go around the city once each day for six amen seven seven seven massandra mustang right now seven days here represent to us here in the new testament seven chapter edges they and all those [Music] they are very foreign foreign of the promised correct stories that [Applause] who are those people we are the people we are the final runners we are the last bride there is no other age read your bible there and in is all over the world regulations that have had that message they receive it they don't kill you they believe it they are killing them and they are not ashamed they're not even questioning to identify themselves with it quite well you pray on the last day a record is sent by the servant priests sacramento muslim carrying the act narrative would god before but again ahead of the people because hallelujah and on the seventh day they were supposed to go around seven times i who can't understand why we are so happy and free so but jordan took on unfair land and this is like heaven to me where are we now we are in heaven heavenly presence of the christ this is like heaven to me praise god sing with me now this is life [Applause] what have we done we've crossed over [Music] amen if god said jericho is yours if if you have understood it crap for the lord baby puppies please let them die oh baby let them die let them die let them die because god will do the accountability and we are the final runners in the message countdown appearing of elijah jesus and [Music] i got [Music] oh when [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] someone i got the ring [Music] i will shout why do you think god did not tell them russia simply speak more get it but they had them walk around yeah because of anger sometimes actions of faith encourage give us that one i want to see those men and women of faith who will walk around i don't care about your name i don't care about your name but just do it as a some of your words will begin to break where is the song brother it will be a great possession oh my god [Music] now [Music] me will be wrong [Music] [Music] i will amen oh my god hallelujah oh my god [Music] crumbling down descending i want to tell you what's in your life are breaking down there you may be seated [Music] the search was under reformation at the end of the six church ages by the seven by the six church ages the church was mainly in a reformation whatever god think about it the last message oh there are four living creatures the bible speaks of foreign what was the first one church the lion gum the second one ox antenna diox there's third one first of all first of all the fourth one the ego the flying ego those of you are wondering where are these people getting there right here i mean in the bible now those are four living creatures that was representing them somewhere for temple gods then he also speaks of them being the anointing the four anointings god sends into the wilderness [Music] what was it let me break they said that it was jesus writing [Applause] but why was he riding on a white horse because he was coming with her with a deception when we see white rabbit we think all the holy spirit but actually the devil was coming dressed in wise to receive the child because the people would think i don't know and say oh this is god oh no the devil i the other day i made a phrase next and i said churches today many people don't go to church even to when you know this adventure again because they can't find something for their souls everyone is suffering and going through things they go to church and all they find was give a seat [Music] and the devil has placed them on full pieces just [Applause] to churches i said why never got married he said i went to church i went out of there when i was full of lust and nun i said why it has become identifiable people making churches to make money it's after money prosperity and power [Music] it's no longer the righteous it's no longer after heaven in every [Music] [Music] and the catholic church the conservatives and this i say it's publicly because mother six to eight million christians new men and oxen is a beast of sacrifice of burden they were killed they were universal kill this woman never told me pastor mark apparently you should move a baby false charts declared that there will be no one who will translate the bible to the common language of the people and no one is allowed to read the bible amen we know this preaching that that time it seemed ratio when apparent when when a black horse came in god brought another anointing the face of a man what who translated the bible into the german arab bible man men like william tinder younger william tyndale who translated despite by the kjv's that's why we read it because they tried to kill to to destroy the spiders you know william tindall would translate many many uh uh uh uh would print many copies william kinder yakuba and the bible that is true but what i'm saying number he he did many copies and the customers would buy them and abandon them and william tindell would take the money they have given are you okay and there are many many testimonies of jerusalem when there fires on a building and they find this bible yeah and that's when the printing press was invented it doesn't even say the man who invented it never made money out of it he sold it off yeah under and then it ended up you know making more profits and making more bibles and so that a printing press was invented for the purpose of this bible have the knowledge but they don't command your translators praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah and then it comes the last anointing i'm afraid that was the devil is a mixture of black white and red and this is our generation the very last one oh gosh the devil satan has come to us i say truly with all the powers that he came in with aliyah collected together hey he has come to us with a white false red horse black horse all together the devil today satan needed seeks to deceive the child i remember the devil today seeks to kill the child today take the word away from the people anointed [Music] this is the last time hallelujah amen all our promises and the decisions we must see them there is i mean joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of the ramadans passed on before the lord and blew the trumpets and the act of the covenant of the lord the arc of the covenant follows the messengers exactly right how a person can call one somebody a prophet and then say they have the wrong in revelation some people say that is a prophet we don't bring them but then again they say he was not having a correct interpretation it's not possible if he's a prophet divine revelation comes to a prophet and here we see to look at versus starting let's skip a bit we go to verstappen starting bring it to try to bring it to our climax now are you tired all right that's good verse 13 to 15 says and seven peace bearing seven trumpets of ram's horns before the earth of the lord went on continually and blew me with the trumpets and then the army men went before them but they reward but every but the reward came after the act of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpet and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp and so they did six days and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose out in the in the alley about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they accomplished the city seven times s all right now in the same manner the bible says in the same manner the same way they went around the city the first day it's the same time they went around in the second half we believe in the blessings of god believe in the power of god from sin of the world [Music] never was in the first season can church they can say of angry was not was not a deity women priests so they said and agreed to improve on their doctor why are they not ordaining women because the word did not allow them why did they improve on their teaching simple you tell me no no no no pastor that is so what happened gotta teach you to see women why didn't they do it but now they want to accept that no need that so what happened cow anyway they're just showing that they had already back asleep now why did i say that right they went i said that to say they do not believe something because the majority are doing it the word of god is the same and does not change foreign find a sister i don't know if i'll use that name which is here i don't know sister [Music] denominational church as he has even reached to a place where it is even worse than the catholic church because at least for them they dress their gowns [Applause] amen back attending the grain and secret way it begin to ripen a tiny coca-cola that you find before the grain can ripen [Music] before it can ripen everything are we talking where are they going to go of course in the rapture hallelujah hallelujah the same grain that went in the ground the same tree that's in the bright form yes oh my do you believe this through these and come out here and then and they come to our heart to to to to now the the the head here for [Music] i don't believe that god wants to rupture a church that is so so sorry jesus christ yes chris is coming back for a chance a joke not a canister without spot without reigning company you know he's coming back for a chat that is victorious i mean i tried that out of a car they can't say one good thing not this can i use as we come to the climax now these people shout and run around i [Applause] and sometimes the preachers preach all that spirit speaks to you come on jump up shout out because of you you know i don't know you know just remain there [Applause] even if no one is [Applause] all right there was a woman once a man and her name was hannah and the voice of god spoke to her can you say that it is not service certificate again pray shall pray for yourself [Music] she when the priest said that he i want you to receive your baby in the secondary no for no man i almost have been saying hallelujah i mean praise the name of the lord joshua told them shout the last time you look same that's our time the believers of the first age had no reason to shout out [Applause] how why i don't have a job yet sinna fernan do you know how long i've looked for a wife the words can stop the children we hear that they are okay you know and uh but when you when when you hear one of them shouting out is there are many there are two great parts of the hospital a duality could be one is the motorist and another one is there is there is no lights that's why we believe our church should not be like a mortuary our church should be full of lives hallelujah amen i might even stay here that's why we develop our faith shout out while praying today you got that now that's why we don't pray like we used to pray to ourselves oh sorry amen i've got an opportunity that i have a living mother and every time we have a baby he has been the first to carry that baby hallelujah i mean and some [Applause] but i knew that she would call me in a time number understand i was yesterday is [Music] i just began smiling because those who are crying the cries of my babies i'm not a father you people who are not your father these faith [Music] hallelujah hallelujah something happened what would she get to me here now i am the one standing in the joshua inspiration because joshua is our holy ghost and i'm telling you shout out [Applause] you will never see hey [Music] hallelujah [Music] listen i'm not going to sing for you i want you to shout to the lord take it away pray like you've never prayed your victories [Music] hallelujah [Music] so [Music] is uh my savior lord there is now unlike you oh my
