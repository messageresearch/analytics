[0:00] greetings to you and welcome to this yet
[0:03] another episode
[0:04] of the voice of the days of the voice
[0:06] broadcast
[0:07] and speaking to you is uh
[0:11] last of the days of the voice fellowship
[0:14] in yangon
[0:28] um
[0:39] as we discuss in the later
[0:43] moments of this
[0:45] series of episodes
[0:51] but in the current episode we've been
[0:52] dealing with a gentile dispensation it
[0:55] was somebody to decode
[1:10] the last episode we did talk about if
[1:11] you're a different church agent
[1:15] um
[1:16] [Music]
[1:20] here
[1:21] and we've been able to find out that uh
[1:25] the
[1:26] web missionary age
[1:29] was during that time
[1:31] uh
[1:32] until
[1:34] around 1906
[2:18] age then comes
[2:20] the ladies
[2:34] oh
[2:36] [Music]
[2:50] because in 1906 we see that there was a
[2:53] great azusa
[2:55] a street revival
[2:59] while
[3:04] many of the theologians know and have
[3:06] started and the priesthood talked about
[3:15] remember
[3:16] by this time we had already had a martin
[3:19] luther commander which said it's not
[3:21] really
[3:22] martin luther
[3:23] who through whom the lord had started a
[3:26] reformation of the church
[3:47] [Music]
[3:58] [Music]
[4:27] you know at azusa street god sparked for
[4:31] the revival that went across the world
[4:58] but you see over time and you know the
[5:00] dominating of the first religion and you
[5:03] know through time you know the chat had
[5:06] relaxed
[5:08] [Applause]
[5:17] is closing in to come to the end of the
[5:20] gentile dispensation
[5:37] in its beginnings you see that happening
[5:40] with the other substitutions
[5:45] and you know revivals went across the
[5:47] world
[5:49] almost every nation on earth
[6:13] but this also
[6:15] started we
[6:16] we should say that this saw the
[6:19] beginning of the last gentile church
[6:32] for
[6:33] those things that happened were also one
[6:36] of the signs that were promised to be
[6:38] the signs of the end
[6:44] [Music]
[6:46] according to the prophecy
[6:48] of the book of job
[6:50] will not be which that which are your
[6:52] way so we say that now the lord they can
[6:54] church age was already on catchword
[6:59] but remember that whenever
[7:53] [Music]
[7:58] but remember that this is the beginning
[8:01] of the closing of the gentile
[8:02] dispensation
[8:05] [Applause]
[8:10] as people fight for their rights
[8:14] god too is fighting for the rights of
[8:16] his children
[8:20] by the late 1940s
[8:52] whenever any
[8:54] a move
[8:56] movement denominates
[8:58] god moves up
[9:06] and when he moves out he doesn't he he
[9:09] seeks so that i will receive him
[9:15] but remember this is the last generation
[9:20] by the
[9:46] and this is the time when we are
[9:48] supposed to hear the last voice
[9:54] voice of god
[9:56] [Music]
[10:03] [Music]
[10:14] from the very beginning
[11:16] this is the time to check
[11:19] that god promised an elijah cadron
[11:23] elijah the prophet
[11:30] [Applause]
[11:40] the one catholic said that
[11:43] it must come i know yet because
[11:46] he must prepare i know take a deep
[11:49] breath of jesus christ
[11:51] of christ
[12:07] [Music]
[12:22] they all believe it is something but
[12:24] never killism
[12:28] they believe uh in the move of god
[12:30] mechanism could hamburg believe in the
[12:32] holy spirit
[12:34] and suddenly god in the last day
[12:37] messenger which is going to be the
[12:38] prophet to the ledechian church age he
[12:41] will have also divine
[12:44] uh function the the grace the divine
[12:48] grace of prophetic grace to be able to
[12:50] tell us
[13:18] right they say things that the aim and
[13:21] the faithful are the true witness
[13:23] the beginning of the direction of god

[14:13] but also
[14:14] not
[14:35] somebody goes in to do their own things
