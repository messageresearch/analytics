[29:46] tonight it's like it's in a form of a
[29:51] question and it
[29:54] says which Captain are you following
[29:59] blessed be the name of the
[30:01] Lord and where we have read in
[30:04] numbers this is the story this is what
[30:07] happened to the children of
[30:10] Israel I want to thank my pastor for the

[30:14] stand before

[30:25] him that God will use me to speak to
[30:30] you if you came expecting he will speak
[30:32] to
[30:34] your blessed be the name of the Lord in
[30:37] this scripture where we have
[30:38] read we are seeing something here in
[30:42] vers 30 we this is our common
[30:46] scripture it has been re-echoed and
[30:48] echoed through the
[30:52] generation amen even
[30:54] here amen but today I will try to take
[30:58] another
[31:00] Direction and Caleb steal the people
[31:03] before
[31:05] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[31:09] possess
[31:10] it for we are well able to overcome
[31:16] it remember the Journey of Israel out of
[31:21] Egypt they came out 2 million
[31:25] people because God had given given them
[31:28] a
[31:29] promise God spoke to
[31:32] Abraham and told him that after 400
[31:35] years he would take them back to the
[31:38] promised
[31:39] land blessed be the name of the Lord and
[31:42] we are seeing you know the the story of
[31:45] Israel how they went to
[31:48] Egypt the prophet say that it was
[31:50] because of
[31:52] jealousy the brothers of Joseph envied
[31:56] him
[31:58] and he was sold in
[32:00] Egypt and when he was there blessed be
[32:04] the name of the Lord amen the Lord
[32:07] blessed uh
[32:10] Joseph and he was prosperous
[32:13] man and but remember in uh remember that
[32:17] before the foundation of the
[32:20] world God knew
[32:23] everything he knew end from the
[32:26] beginning
[32:27] so it was the will of God for Joseph to
[32:31] be sold in
[32:33] Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord it
[32:37] was not a
[32:39] coincidence amen it was just a
[32:42] coincidence for you to bypass your
[32:47] theop but God knew that it would
[32:51] happen blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:54] and out of the two million people who
[32:57] came who came from Egypt going to the
[33:00] promised
[33:02] land the Bible points Two
[33:05] Men and that is Joshua and
[33:08] Cal and calb was a type of a
[33:13] Believer blessed be the name of the Lord
[33:16] because when God met Moses in the
[33:18] burning
[33:20] bush and Moses gave many
[33:24] excuses amen and God also ask him some
[33:29] questions who made the
[33:31] dumb
[33:32] [Applause]
[33:37] the but Moses kept on giving many
[33:41] excuses praise the
[33:44] Lord
[33:47] amen
[33:49] so
[33:51] finally God asked Moses what do you have
[33:53] on your
[33:56] hand but remember if we go way
[34:00] back that how Moses was
[34:03] raised because God had given Abram a
[34:07] promise and that promise had to come to
[34:10] pass no matter regardless of whatever
[34:15] happens when God gives a
[34:19] promise nothing will hinder that promise
[34:21] to come to
[34:23] pass like the Min like uh the minister
[34:27] was telling us the other day brother
[34:30] Muka that when a seed is planted in the
[34:33] right
[34:35] ground even if you don't pour water on
[34:37] that
[34:39] ground provided that it has the right uh
[34:43] uh uh it has the right
[34:47] atmosphere that seed will have to
[34:52] germinate blessed be the name of the
[34:54] Lord in the Bible says the word of God
[34:56] is a seed
[35:00] praise be to
[35:01] God
[35:03] Amen and here we are seeing that in
[35:06] their
[35:07] Journey Moses chose chose 12
[35:12] Spies out of each
[35:14] tribe to go and spy the
[35:18] land amen and Among Us the
[35:22] 12 there was Joshua and
[35:25] Caleb and when this man go and spy the
[35:30] land they had to bring back the
[35:33] report because God had already given
[35:36] them that
[35:38] land it depends on the perspective you
[35:41] are seeing you are looking at the word
[35:43] of
[35:46] God Amen and here we are seeing uh in
[35:51] verses
[35:53] 30 when this man came back
[35:58] the 10 of them gave their report
[36:04] first according to this verse
[36:07] here the bible say that calb Ste the
[36:12] people something had
[36:15] happened
[36:17] amen until this started
[36:21] recreating asking Moses many
[36:25] questions were there no graves in
[36:28] Egypt that you brought us to die from
[36:32] here praise be to
[36:35] God
[36:37] Amen but the Bible
[36:40] says Cale steal the
[36:43] people before
[36:45] Moses remember when God met
[36:49] Moses he told
[36:51] Moses that Aaron will be a
[36:55] prophet and you will be a
[36:58] God and he said to
[37:00] Moses I speak to him lips to
[37:05] ear but to others I speak to them in
[37:09] dreams blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:12] when Moses met the pillar of
[37:15] fire the pillar fire not remain at the
[37:20] bur you believe
[37:22] that
[37:24] amen but when he met the pillar of
[37:28] fire the pillar of fire incarnated in
[37:34] Moses and mes was no longer
[37:37] Moses but was God in
[37:41] Moses and Moses's
[37:43] word was as good as God's
[37:48] word amen do you know that Moses created
[37:54] flies you know that he created frogs
[37:58] by the spoken
[38:00] word because God the creator of Heaven
[38:02] and
[38:04] Earth was in
[38:06] Moses he was incarnated in
[38:10] Moses praise be to
[38:13] God
[38:15] Amen you've heard the story of the of
[38:18] Lot's
[38:21] wife when Lord disobeyed the word of
[38:25] God because the word the
[38:28] was they were not supposed to look
[38:31] back but because she had hied a lot of
[38:35] wealth while Lord was
[38:38] running she was
[38:40] tempted to look
[38:42] back amen but remember God's word calls
[38:47] for total
[38:50] separation total separation from
[38:55] unbel amen
[38:58] and the other time when we had interview
[39:00] here with with brother
[39:04] Muka and one brother asked a
[39:08] question it was a business
[39:11] question whereby like if you have a
[39:14] business and you also have a plan
[39:18] B and I remember the way he answered
[39:21] it he said that as long as you have a
[39:24] plan B
[39:27] you will easily be driven
[39:32] back now in
[39:35] Christianity when we come to
[39:37] Christ is our plan A to
[39:42] Z Jesus is the only plan
[39:46] a is the Al and the
[39:50] Omega so when we surrender our life to
[39:54] Jesus we don't have other plan B
[39:59] either he saves us or we
[40:02] die either provide for us or we
[40:06] die either he heals us or we
[40:10] die it's the only plan we
[40:14] have blessed be the name of the Lord so
[40:18] because not's wife had a
[40:21] lot she was tempted to look
[40:24] back and it is believe it said and
[40:26] believed
[40:29] that even today when you go to that
[40:32] place you'll find that pillar of
[40:35] [Music]
[40:37] salt because Lot's wife became pill of
[40:41] salt but when Moses met the pillar of
[40:45] fire the pillar of fire entered in
[40:50] Moses amen that's why we must receive
[40:54] the Holy Ghost
[40:58] 31 say but but but the men that went up
[41:01] with him
[41:04] said we be not able to go up against the
[41:09] people they are stronger than
[41:13] we this man had forgotten
[41:17] something they had forgotten about
[41:21] God and the 10 spy in their
[41:26] testimony telling the
[41:29] congregation these men they are stronger
[41:31] than
[41:33] us they are stronger than
[41:36] we they had forgotten about that they
[41:38] had God in
[41:42] their we are nothing without
[41:45] God but when we have
[41:48] God greater is he that is in
[41:52] us there a devil in the
[41:55] world we don't about our our
[41:59] strength we don't brag about our
[42:02] muscles but we brag about our
[42:05] God how great our God
[42:08] is blessed be the name of the Lord this
[42:12] why they had the captain leading
[42:15] them and always there are two captain in
[42:18] every
[42:20] battle there some people when the battle
[42:23] is
[42:24] fierce they start to discourage
[42:28] others and they're calling for
[42:31] retweet but remember that song
[42:34] says he has sounded forth the
[42:38] trumpet and will not sound for a
[42:42] retweet amen the trumpet we have
[42:47] heard it was a call for a
[42:50] war and Jesus is our
[42:54] captain and as long as you following
[42:56] this captain
[42:59] Victory is our so they forgot about
[43:03] God and then they said this men they
[43:07] stronger than
[43:09] we and they brought up evil report of
[43:12] the
[43:15] land which they had searched the
[43:17] children of
[43:19] Israel saying the
[43:22] land uh through which we have gone to
[43:25] search it
[43:28] it is a land that eateth up the
[43:32] inhabitant
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:37] thereof how what you see what fear can
[43:44] do fear can make electricity shock you
[43:47] when even the power is
[43:55] off even for three
[43:58] days that's what fear can
[44:04] do and the Bible tells us that a wicked
[44:08] runs even when there is no one
[44:11] chasing because they live under
[44:15] fear being that this men were
[44:18] Wicked because to begin with they never
[44:21] believe the promise of
[44:24] God that's why they fabric geted the
[44:29] message and they say the other land eat
[44:32] even its own
[44:36] people
[44:39] amen the message is very
[44:42] hard young men go
[44:46] slow oh I remember in
[44:48] 70s in 80s we were on
[44:52] fire what happened
[44:59] amen which Captain are you following
[45:03] tonight which witness are you listening
[45:07] to because we are surrounded by the
[45:09] great cloud of
[45:12] witnesses but we are following the right
[45:16] Witnesses those who made it like
[45:19] Abraham who obtained like
[45:22] Moses who made it like
[45:25] Joshua those are our
[45:27] Witnesses we are looking
[45:29] at we are looking at
[45:32] Jesus who is the
[45:34] author and the finisher of our
[45:38] faith that's why the Bible says let us
[45:41] lay aside every
[45:43] way and
[45:46] every that easily be set
[45:48] out blessed be the name of the
[45:51] Lord say and there we saw the giant the
[45:56] sons of
[46:00] [Music]
[46:01] an
[46:04] listen this was the negative testimony
[46:07] from the 10
[46:12] spies it was a nagging
[46:17] testimony
[46:20] discouraging but
[46:22] remember when these people went to spy
[46:25] Jericho
[46:28] and they met that prostitute who hid
[46:31] them do you still remember her
[46:35] testimony she said that when we
[46:38] had what your God is doing outside
[46:43] there amen our heart
[46:48] melted and when Joshua and C had that
[46:54] testimony amen they picked up
[46:57] courage they knew that God had already
[46:59] given them
[47:02] Jero blessed be the name of the Lord but
[47:06] this man they had other
[47:09] interest they forgot that
[47:12] testimony that's why the Bible
[47:14] says you should not forget the Lord's
[47:19] testimony amen that's how David got
[47:23] courage King SA
[47:27] I was wearing my father's
[47:29] l and a bear came and grabbed one and I
[47:35] killed it another time lion came so as
[47:39] who is this

[48:08] congregation lifted up their voice and
[48:10] cried and the people wept that
[48:23] night they cried the whole night
[48:28] instead of praying the whole
[48:31] night they cry the whole
[48:34] night says the strongest weapon which
[48:38] God has put in the hand of man is
[48:44] prayer not
[48:46] crying take it to the Lord in
[48:50] prayer if these people had
[48:53] changed and went before God In Prayer
[48:58] that will be something
[49:01] different blessed be the name of the
[49:03] Lord and the children of Israel mured
[49:06] against Moses and against Aaron and the
[49:08] whole congregation said unto them would

[49:15] them would God that we had die in the
[49:17] land of Egypt or would God we had died

[49:35] and wherefore have the Lord brought us
[49:37] unto this land to Fall by the sword that
[49:40] our wives and our children should be a
[49:42] pray where it not better for us to to

[53:00] of Israel and the Lord said unto Moses
[53:02] how long will these people provoke me
[53:04] and how long will it be here they
[53:07] believe me for all the signs which I
[53:09] have showed amongst them I will Smite
[53:12] them with a pestilence amen amen so God
[53:16] came
[53:17] down God was
[53:19] washing he was looking at their
[53:22] Ming amen the bible say that God is so
[53:26] long
[53:27] suffering that it does not will that
[53:29] anybody should
[53:31] perish so God gave them
[53:34] time to S
[53:37] themselves God will always give you time
[53:39] to S yourself
[53:41] out but when God came
[53:44] out it was time for
[53:47] danger he told Moses now this case is
[53:51] beyond your
[53:53] level blessed be the name of the Lord SE
[53:57] of God these people they said let us
[54:00] make our make ourself a
[54:03] captain who will lead them
[54:06] back into the
[54:08] bondage blessed be the name of the Lord
[54:11] in the generation we are living
[54:13] in we have received the
[54:16] message with a voice behind
[54:19] it this message is saying let my people
[54:25] go ship
[54:27] me amen but there are those who came out
[54:31] with
[54:32] us blessed be the name of the
[54:36] Lord and for them they are not willing
[54:40] to
[54:42] move they're not willing to cross
[54:45] over when this
[54:48] reaches the prop sayses is a Jud was a
[54:51] judgment seat of God
[54:56] was supposed to be
[54:58] judged they could not cross over with
[55:02] unbelief God tried
[55:05] them destroyed their
[55:08] faith blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:11] but only two were
[55:14] approved amen one in a
[55:19] million every million one came out of
[55:24] it blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[55:29] and if you look at in the message
[55:30] lifting him out of
[55:34] History butam talked about one
[55:38] man his name was called
[55:41] amam and
[55:43] jeed that Moses and Moses mother and
[55:48] father the people they were in
[55:51] bondage but they knew the
[55:54] promise because God had G abrah
[55:58] promised that after 400
[56:01] years he will bring them out of
[56:04] Egypt and will take them to the promised
[56:07] land blessed be the name of the Lord and
[56:12] says this they knew the promise of
[56:16] God and this man would pray every
[56:20] day amen 400 years
[56:24] that uh God
[56:26] okay the 400 yard has
[56:31] reached and he
[56:34] remembered the
[56:36] promise so this man was in
[56:39] prayer and in this message the prophet
[56:42] says but there was one man and woman who
[56:45] seems to have faith in historical
[56:50] God that spoke to Abraham in time of
[56:53] crisis
[56:56] the god that spoke to Abraham in time of
[57:01] Crisis and they believe that they could
[57:03] call on
[57:05] him and he would
[57:08] answer do you believe that God answers
[57:12] prayers the Bible says whoever comes to
[57:15] God must believe that he
[57:18] is and a
[57:20] rewarder of them that
[57:23] seek so this man they remember
[57:26] historical
[57:29] God blessed be the name of the Lord and
[57:32] when we're in the
[57:33] denomination in our Pentecostal
[57:36] denomination in our Catholic
[57:38] denomination we just used to hear about
[57:41] the God of
[57:43] history but it is in this
[57:47] message where the Prophet tells us that
[57:51] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[57:56] and forever and he proved
[58:00] it blessed be the name of the
[58:02] Lord amen when Moses met the pillar of
[58:08] fire the history
[58:11] changed the god of the
[58:14] history the god of
[58:16] Abraham became the god of
[58:20] Moses amen he became the god in Moses
[58:27] blessed be the name of the
[58:29] Lord so these people they had faith in
[58:32] the god of
[58:34] hisory and this man with his
[58:39] wife he says that uh they were
[58:44] praying they were tired of the
[58:47] oppression from their
[58:50] oppress because
[58:52] remember the Bible tells us that when
[58:55] pharaoh died there Pharaoh did not know
[59:02] Moses
[59:06] amen and this man started mistreating
[59:09] the children of
[59:12] Israel blessed be the name of the
[59:15] Lord and here
[59:18] dramatized the amam and jeh
[59:23] story sometime some time ago I was
[59:26] preaching and gave a little illustration
[59:27] of how am would come home at night and
[59:30] say je I'm so
[59:40] tired I'm so tired and fresh lashes on
[59:44] his
[59:46] back for from the task Master's
[59:54] wife and she would sit down patiently
[59:56] perhaps and wash out the places and weep
[59:59] and say oh
[1:00:05] am isn't there something that can be
[1:00:09] done would hear him
[1:00:12] say dear if you have been with me
[1:00:17] today and seen them beat them young
[1:00:22] boys trying to pull those Lords
[1:00:27] but they were
[1:00:28] heartless they treated them like they
[1:00:31] were
[1:00:32] animals and that is our young men of
[1:00:36] Israel there something that can be
[1:00:42] done that is what I wonder
[1:00:45] now to see our young teenager
[1:00:49] boys that will be the men and women of
[1:00:53] tomorrow and our team today
[1:00:57] ha down in their
[1:01:01] neck ha
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:05] down and and bres pulled down over their
[1:01:17] hips with a pistol St in their
[1:01:22] side a cigarette in their in the side of
[1:01:25] the
[1:01:27] MTH what will it
[1:01:29] be it is still slavery under the
[1:01:33] devil isn't there something that can be
[1:01:37] done blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:01:41] prophet is comparing that time and the
[1:01:44] time we are living
[1:01:47] in the other time it was physical
[1:01:51] slavy but
[1:01:53] today people still under the sh of the
[1:01:58] devil amen young men with
[1:02:03] dreadlocks and they in
[1:02:05] churches they dancing for Jesus they in
[1:02:09] the choir they're playing
[1:02:11] music with huge
[1:02:14] necklaces with Balan
[1:02:18] throwers amen still under the same the
[1:02:22] devil
[1:02:24] slavery and am perhaps one of one of the
[1:02:28] only one of the nation would climb up a
[1:02:31] little
[1:02:32] stair regardless of how tired he
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:39] was there each night held call on God of
[1:02:45] Abraham the one that he had learned that
[1:02:48] come to
[1:02:51] Abraham first comes by hearing the word
[1:02:56] amen and in the hours of
[1:03:00] distress and surely if he was God in
[1:03:03] their
[1:03:04] day he would be God in that
[1:03:08] day and if he was God in
[1:03:13] Moses he is called
[1:03:15] today he just need to be called upon out
[1:03:18] of

[1:03:51] the bible say that Joshua steal the

[1:34:43] around like when Jesus was with the
[1:34:46] disciple and he told them go and we meet
[1:34:49] to the other
[1:34:50] side and the devil thought that he was
