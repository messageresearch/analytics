[38:19] and minister to us in this few minutes.
[38:24] May you outshine us tonight.
[38:29] May you fill this place with your glory.

[45:53] to back down.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of
[46:02] Praise be to God.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it is on your side.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:16] I'm sorry that
[46:18] I refuse to back down.
[46:23] And that should be our confession
[46:24] tonight.
[46:27] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And if
[46:29] you go back to the scripture we have
[46:30] just read,
[46:32] &gt;&gt; he said that it shall come to pass.
[46:36] Amen. If thou shalt hearken diligently
[46:40] unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
[46:45] to do all his commandments,
[46:48] which I command thee this day,
[46:52] that the Lord thy God will set thee on
[46:55] high.
[46:58] Amen.
[47:00] Praise be to God above all nations.
[47:05] This is the Lord giving the promise.
[47:09] If we shall obey,
[47:12] if we shall hearken unto the Lord our
[47:14] God,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord and
[47:19] hearken unto him.
[47:22] Praise be to God.
[47:25] The Lord gave us his word.
[47:28] He gave us his promise.
[47:31] Praise be to God.
[47:33] I've never read anywhere
[47:37] where we are encouraged to back down.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. BUT EVERY SINGLE
[47:45] SCRIPTURE we read,
[47:47] the Lord encourages us.
[47:50] He tells US TO FEAR NOT.
[47:53] HE TELLS US to press on.
[47:56] Amen. So we don't have any other excuse.
[48:02] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[48:04] And tonight
[48:07] that ought to be our confession.
[48:10] No matter what is happening around,
[48:14] I know the year is ending.
[48:17] All of us when the beginning,
[48:21] we had a list of things
[48:24] we blessed before the Lord.
[48:27] Amen.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[48:31] And now since you're approaching the end
[48:34] of the year,
[48:37] there are many voices speaking to us.
[48:40] And you find these voices.
[48:43] Most of them, they are negative voices.
[48:48] Trying to discourage us.
[48:51] Praise be TO GOD. BUT TONIGHT, I WANT
[48:54] you to look unto the Lord.
[48:56] Let us look at WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US.
[49:01] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF the Lord because
[49:03] that's what he promised us.
[49:06] He told us to look unto Jesus
[49:09] who is our who is the author.
[49:12] Amen. THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA OF our
[49:16] faith.
[49:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[49:21] Amen. Amen. I remember one time a pastor
[49:23] preached a message.
[49:26] No retreat, no surrender.
[49:30] Praise be to God. We are not ready to
[49:32] retreat.
[49:35] We are not ready to step down.
[49:38] We are not ready to give up.
[49:41] Praise be to God. Amen. But we ARE HERE
[49:43] TO FIGHT EVERY DAY,
[49:46] FIGHTING the Lord's battle,
[49:49] PRESSING ON
[49:51] TO THE MARK OF high calling.
[49:54] Praise be to God.
[49:57] Amen.
[49:58] And we are not going to retreat.
[50:02] We are marching on.
[50:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[50:07] Lord gave us a promise.
[50:10] He never say that our enemy will not
[50:12] attack us.
[50:15] He say THEY WILL COME
[50:18] AND THEY COMING ONE WAY.
[50:21] PRAISE BE to God. BUT GUESS WHAT'S GOING
[50:23] TO HAPPEN?
[50:27] He will strike them
[50:30] and they will scatter in seven.
[50:35] Praise be to God. When God called Israel
[50:38] out of Egypt,
[50:40] he only mentioned the promised land
[50:44] and that was the main main reason
[50:47] why he called them. He was taking them
[50:50] TO THE PROMISED LAND
[50:52] BECAUSE GOD had given Abraham a promise.
[50:57] Praise be to God. God knew that the Red
[50:59] Sea WAS THERE.
[51:02] HE knew that the challenges are on the
[51:04] way.
[51:06] Praise be TO GOD. BUT THEIR INTENTION,
[51:10] they are supposed to believe the word of
[51:12] God.
[51:15] BECAUSE WHEN GOD SPEAKS, WHEN GOD CALLS
[51:19] US,
[51:21] AMEN. It is him who called us.
[51:24] It is his calling.
[51:27] He's the one leading the way.
[51:30] PRAISE BE TO GOD. THIS other business
[51:33] alongside the way.
[51:36] That is God's business.
[51:40] Praise be to God.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet preached the
[51:45] message third exodus.
[51:48] Jesus said as it was in HIS FIRST COMING
[51:53] SHALL it be in his second coming just
[51:58] the way they had challenges in their
[51:59] first excuse
[52:03] the same things.
[52:06] Hallelujah. WE ARE GOING TO FACE them in
[52:09] this excerpt.
[52:11] Praise be to God. But remember there are
[52:14] key people in that exodus
[52:18] that is Joshua and Caleb
[52:22] who knew their promise
[52:25] who were not willing to see it.
[52:28] Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Who
[52:32] were updated with the message of their
[52:34] day.
[52:38] There's no we are not WE ARE GOING TO
[52:39] KNOW THE TIME WE are living in
[52:43] without recognizing the message of our
[52:45] day.
[52:48] The message of OUR DAY IS WHAT'S
[52:50] POINTING US TO THE promises of God.
[52:56] Amen. THAT'S WHAT IS SHOWING US THE DAYS
[52:59] WE ARE LIVING IN.
[53:02] How close we ARE TO THE COMING OF THE
[53:04] LORD.
[53:06] MANY TIME WE ARE not we are not in fire
[53:09] for God
[53:12] because we have forgotten
[53:14] about the days we are living in.
[53:17] Praise be to God. We are THE PEOPLE WHO
[53:20] OUGHT TO BE ON FIRE FOR God
[53:24] because we KNOW THAT THE BRIDE HAS A
[53:27] MINISTRY.
[53:29] Praise be to God. way.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But many time
[53:34] we we back down
[53:38] things nowadays.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. But there are men and
[53:44] women
[53:46] WHO ARE LIKE THE OTHER bunch
[53:49] whom Paul met
[53:52] who are serving unknown god.
[53:56] You find them on prayer mountain
[53:59] in the bushes.
[54:01] praying, seeking God.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But the bride in THIS GENERATION, WE
[54:08] KNOW WHERE GOD HAS CHOSEN PLACE OF
[54:10] WORSHIP IS.
[54:14] AMEN. BUT MANY TIME WE FORGET.
[54:19] BUT I PERSONALLY LIKE JOSHUA OF ALL S
[54:23] AND MY HOUSE, WE SHALL SERVE THE LORD.
[54:28] PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND I'M HERE TO TELL
[54:30] YOU tonight that you also choose ye this
[54:33] day.
[54:36] Praise be to God.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; That's why I would have say that we
[54:42] refuse to surrender or to back down.
[54:48] That's why I would have said we refuse
[54:53] to back down
[54:56] to surrender
[54:58] to step down
[55:00] to go back. But I said I
[55:07] so it's up to you.
[55:22] Amen. We have not GOT TO HAVE OUR MIND
[55:25] MADE UP.
[55:28] We have not got to have our mind make
[55:30] made up like to made up our mind.
[55:40] But let us decide IN OUR HEART
[55:46] PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[55:48] AMEN. IT IS OUR HEARTS THAT SERVE GOD,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; NOT OUR MIND.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[55:59] AMEN. BUT WE SERVE GOD WITH OUR HEART.
[56:04] PRAISE BE TO GOD. SO THAT'S WHY TONIGHT,
[56:08] LET US MAKE UP OUR MIND. LET US TELL THE
[56:12] DEVIL THAT TODAY I CHOSE [screaming]
[56:16] NOT TO STEP BACK.
[56:19] AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT IS COMING OUR WAY,
[56:24] WE ARE MOVING FORWARD.
[56:27] BECAUSE IN OUR DNA,
[56:30] HALLELUJAH. In the MIND OF GOD, BEFORE
[56:33] THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[56:35] HALLELUJAH, GOD SAW US MAKING IT. HE SAW
[56:40] US GOING THROUGH
[56:42] TODAY. AND THAT IS WHO WE ARE. THAT IS
[56:45] WHAT identified us.
[56:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Even
[56:51] our LORD JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE WAS
[56:54] CARRYING THE CROSS, HE REACHED A CERTAIN
[56:57] POINT AND HE WAS FALLING with the cross.
[57:03] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[57:07] WHEN SIMON THE SER CAME
[57:11] JESUS,
[57:13] Jesus never told him
[57:16] now have the cross.
[57:22] He would have said
[57:27] but since you have come now carry the
[57:30] cross.
[57:33] Praise be to God.
[57:37] But no matter what happened,
[57:40] Jesus was giving us an example.
[57:44] HE WAS CARRYING IT,
[57:47] FALLING DOWN AND RISING UP. THAT IS OUR
[57:51] CHRISTIAN JOURNEY,
[57:54] OUR CHRISTIAN WALK.
[57:56] HALLELUJAH. THINGS WILL NOT BE OKAY ALL
[57:59] THE TIME.

[1:00:41] But a prophet tells
[1:00:44] that there is no man
[1:00:47] that has ever had any situation
[1:00:50] like that of Jonah.
[1:00:53] Jonah was in the belly OF THE

[1:00:59] VOMIT. HE WOULD TOUCH.
[1:01:02] HE WOULD TOUCH
[1:01:04] ROTTEN THINGS. BUT HE REFUSED TO GIVE

[1:02:34] WHEN WE ARE SAVED BY OUR enemy
[1:02:37] and YOU CRY UNTO GOD, HE COMES DOWN and
[1:02:41] make a way.
[1:02:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord.

[1:10:06] Have you seen it anyway?
[1:10:11] No sir.
[1:10:15] Because it will bring bad image.
[1:10:20] We're in the time of campaign.
[1:10:23] I've never heard anywhere.
[1:10:25] President went there
[1:10:28] and somebody was in.

[1:10:55] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IS CHAINING.
[1:10:59] BUT ONE THING I KNOW, THE BIBLE TELLS ME
[1:11:03] THAT THE LORD HE HAS MAGNIFIED HIS WORD.
[1:11:09] AT THE NAME OF JESUS,
[1:11:12] EVERY KNEE PASS, EVERY TONGUE CONFESS
[1:11:15] THAT JESUS IS LORD
[1:11:18] IF AT THE NAME OF JESUS.
[1:11:22] But he SAYS IN SOME

[1:12:04] HE CAME DOWN.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER CAME TO VISIT.
[1:12:10] HE CAME TO STAY.

[1:12:36] Blessed be the name of God.
[1:12:38] We are not in guesswork.
[1:12:41] The Lord himself
[1:12:44] came down and vindicated this world
[1:12:48] and he manifested himself to you.
[1:12:52] And why did he send a message?
[1:12:55] He sent a message for us to know our
[1:12:58] identity
[1:13:00] like Jesus of old.
[1:13:02] Jesus who stood AND SAID, "I CAME FROM
[1:13:06] GOD. I'M GOING BACK TO GOD."
[1:13:10] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TELL THE WORLD

[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BUT IT WAS GOD IN
[1:13:32] FRONT.
[1:13:33] THE ONLY GODHEAD WAS IN HIM.
[1:13:37] WHY? Because he wanted
[1:13:41] us to know our identity.
[1:13:45] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:13:48] We have no reason of retreating.
[1:13:52] We have no reason of regretting
[1:13:56] what has happened this year.
[1:13:59] But I'm here to tell you
[1:14:01] just press on.
[1:14:04] LET US MOVE ON.
[1:14:06] AMEN. AMEN. THERE'S NO GIVING GROUND TO
[1:14:08] THE ENEMY.

[1:14:19] BACK AND RECLAIM YOUR GROUND.
[1:14:23] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:14:26] Let the Lord come.
[1:14:28] David say, "Lay the Lord arise and his
[1:14:32] enemies."
[1:14:35] When Jesus rose on the
[1:14:41] Amen, the storms were
[1:14:46] peace be still.
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And the sea obeyed.

[1:14:56] is speaking tonight.
[1:14:58] Bless Jesus
[1:15:00] speaking his word. Blessed shall be the
[1:15:03] name of the Lord. Whatever God has
[1:15:05] promised us in this last days, he will
[1:15:09] fulfill it. He said that in last days
[1:15:13] power must be upon all
[1:15:16] sons and daughters
[1:15:19] vision all men with dreams
[1:15:22] and upon my handmade
[1:15:25] they shall prophesy.
[1:15:27] Amen. AMEN. BROTHER, SISTER, THAT IS OUR
[1:15:31] PROMISE.
[1:15:32] and the same word
[1:15:35] you cannot go back to God

[1:15:40] he will fulfill it.
[1:15:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; We have no reason to retreat back.
[1:15:48] No reason to look back.
[1:15:52] Jesus reminded us
[1:15:55] of Lot's wife.
[1:15:57] He said remember Lot.
[1:16:00] She looked back.
[1:16:03] Amen. One leg was in the Lord and
[1:16:06] another leg was in the world.
[1:16:10] The angel told them to run.
[1:16:13] Maybe she had a lot of investment.
[1:16:19] And when she heard them busting,
[1:16:23] maybe she had petrol station.
[1:16:27] And when fire came from heaven
[1:16:30] and she had the explosion
[1:16:33] was oh

[1:16:39] if you will
[1:16:42] blessed be the name of the Lord and she
[1:16:45] turned to me
[1:16:47] and she became a pill of salt.
[1:16:50] Praise be to God. WE BETTER DECIDE
[1:16:53] TONIGHT.
[1:16:55] LET US DECIDE. IF GOD IS GOD, LET US
[1:16:59] serve him.
[1:17:01] AMEN. SOMETIME WE WORSHIP GOD IN THE way
[1:17:06] until I wonder
[1:17:10] whether indeed the Lord did something
[1:17:12] for you.
[1:17:16] Everything you're just forced to do.
[1:17:21] Other sing I am bound for the promise.
[1:17:24] Others
[1:17:26] are singing and even when you look at
[1:17:29] them
[1:17:31] body language telling
[1:17:34] that they bound to the promised land.
[1:17:38] Praise be to God. DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY
[1:17:41] ARE LIKE THAT? IT'S BECAUSE THEY
[1:17:43] THEOPHONY
[1:17:46] BOUND ALREADY THERE.
[1:17:48] THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER GROUP.
[1:18:02] There is something wrong somewhere.
[1:18:06] Give the LORD A BIGGER HAND CLAP.
[1:18:12] For you that is the bigger hand clap.
[1:18:19] But to those when he reach
[1:18:22] down [screaming]
[1:18:24] for me
[1:18:28] and he reach
[1:18:30] DOWN HIS SON FOR ME.
[1:18:35] I WAS LOST [screaming] AND UNTOUCHED
[1:18:40] without God.
[1:18:44] Then he reached
[1:18:49] for me. You find them in tears.
[1:18:54] She remember when she was
[1:18:57] in the world.
[1:19:00] Maybe she was in witchcraft.
[1:19:03] Maybe she had no consciousness.
[1:19:07] MAYBE WAS IN THE PROSTITUTE HOUSE.
[1:19:11] ONE DAY
[1:19:12] AN EVANGELIST PREACHED
[1:19:15] THE ONCOMING STORM
[1:19:18] AND SHE RECEIVED the word. Oh, he
[1:19:20] received the world.
[1:19:23] Amen. Amen. And then the Lord pulled him
[1:19:26] over.
[1:19:29] So when the song sings such

[1:19:52] they were lost and undone,
[1:19:56] brother, sister,
[1:19:58] no man could buy our salvation.
[1:20:03] Praise be to God. Let me read a

[1:22:30] and I go and fornicate,
[1:22:33] isn't that blasphem?
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] [laughter] Praise be to God.

[1:24:43] party was at home.
[1:24:46] Praise be to God. All of us we acquitted
[1:24:49] with that story.
[1:24:51] The one whose daughter gave analas.
[1:24:58] Amen.
[1:25:00] He took the Bible from
[1:25:03] blessed be the name of the Lord. There's
[1:25:05] something that I want to show you here.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; This man, they thought the Bible was his
[1:25:10] problem.
[1:25:12] But he was delivered.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; He was the Bible.
[1:25:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's
[1:25:20] why take away from him the Bible.
[1:25:24] And they swapped it with Atlas.
[1:25:28] Still when he was opening,
[1:25:31] PRAISE THE LORD AND HE SAW THE SEA
[1:25:34] THERE.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE SAW the Red Sea.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; MAYBE RED SEA.
[1:25:40] BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ISRAELITE
[1:25:42] CROSS.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; He remembered his sin was THROWN
[1:25:48] [laughter] IN THE sea of forgetfulness.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS THERE SHOUTING AND RUNNING
[1:26:00] GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And he was disrupting these people.
[1:26:08] Praise be to God.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Because he was delivered,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; he couldn't put him down, brother.
[1:26:16] AMEN. [screaming]
[1:26:17] THE DEVIL CANNOT SIT ON US.
[1:26:20] HE CAN'T PUT US DOWN, BROTHER.
[1:26:23] I'M HERE TO CHALLENGE YOU. I WANT TO
[1:26:25] TELL YOU, DO NOT ALLOW THAT SITUATION
[1:26:29] SIT UPON YOU.
[1:26:32] YOU A CHILD OF GOD.
[1:26:35] AMEN.
[1:26:36] WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Few months ago,
[1:26:47] had a lot of things on me,
[1:26:50] a lot of discouragement.
[1:26:53] Praise be to God. Amen. IT WAS A SERIOUS
[1:26:57] BATTLE within me.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah.
[1:27:01] BUT INSIDE MY SOUL,
[1:27:04] SOMETHING WAS TELLING ME
[1:27:06] YOU ARE MORE THAN OVERCOMER.
[1:27:09] Just keep pressing on.
[1:27:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. SOMETIME I
[1:27:17] REMEMBER SOMETIME WAS SO DISCOURAGED.
[1:27:21] I said today I'm not going to go for
[1:27:22] fellowship.
[1:27:25] Praise be TO GOD. YES, I'M SINCERE to
[1:27:29] you.
[1:27:32] [laughter]
[1:27:33] And the devil will give many reason.
[1:27:36] You are weak,
[1:27:38] you are sick, even the transport is not
[1:27:41] enough.
[1:27:44] But before I realize
[1:27:46] I find myself here
[1:27:51] SOMETIME
[1:27:52] YOU ARE SO LOW
[1:27:55] SO DOWN
[1:27:57] YOUR NETWORK bus
[1:28:04] have like five bars
[1:28:10] that is Jesus.
[1:28:14] Praise be to God. But there's a time
[1:28:18] when even one is not there.
[1:28:21] But still I press myself
[1:28:25] say God let me JUST COME TO CHURCH.
[1:28:29] LET ME tell you sometime
[1:28:32] during the course of the day I just come
[1:28:35] and sit here like this.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DAVID IS SAYING, I WAS GLAD WHEN
[1:28:45] THEY SAID TO ME, let us go in the house
[1:28:47] of God.
[1:28:49] HE SAID, GOD, LET ME JUST BE A DOORKE
[1:28:53] KEEPER.
[1:28:54] Let me JUST BE A RAG
[1:28:57] YOU ARE SEEING THERE.
[1:29:00] Praise be to God. AMEN. BUT I THANK GOD
[1:29:05] THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY, HE ENCOURAGES ME.
[1:29:09] IS TELLING ME THAT IS NOT YOUR IDENTITY.
[1:29:13] YOU ARE MY CHILD. YOU ARE CHILD OF GOD.
[1:29:17] JUST PRESS ON.
[1:29:20] PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:29:23] AND THAT'S WHY EVEN THIS EVENING I am
[1:29:26] standing here
[1:29:28] by the grace of God and I'm telling you.
[1:29:33] That's where I got my text from.
[1:29:37] That I chose not
[1:29:40] to back down
[1:29:42] to go back.
[1:29:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord. AND I'M
[1:29:47] NOT WILLING TO GO BACK. I'M NOT READY TO
[1:29:50] GO BACK. I [screaming] WILL NEVER GO
[1:29:52] BACK BECAUSE I HAVE DECIDED
[1:29:56] TO FOLLOW JESUS. [screaming]
[1:29:59] [cheering]
[1:30:01] AMEN. AMEN. WHEN I WAS JOINING THIS
[1:30:04] ARMY,
[1:30:06] I KNEW THAT THE PLEASURES ARE IN THE
[1:30:07] WORLD.
[1:30:09] I KNEW that there are many THINGS IN THE
[1:30:11] WORLD. THERE ARE MANY APPEALING THING IN
[1:30:13] THE WORLD.
[1:30:15] BUT I JOINED THIS ARMY.
[1:30:18] GOD GAVE ME THAT GRACE.
[1:30:21] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT READY TO GO BACK.
[1:30:26] SOMETIME I'M BEATEN DOWN.
[1:30:28] But there is a scripture that encourages
[1:30:30] me.
[1:30:32] THOUGH WE ARE PERPLEXED.
[1:30:35] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; THOUGH WE ARE BEATEN DOWN,
[1:30:39] WE ARE TROUBLED ON EITHER SIDE.
[1:30:41] BUT WE ARE NOT FORSAKEN.
[1:30:45] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES WE ARE BEATEN.
[1:30:50] MANY TIME WE ARE STRIVE
[1:30:53] BUT one thing that KEEPS ME MOVING.
[1:30:56] I AM NOT FORSAKEN.
[1:30:59] THE LORD HIMSELF SPOKE AND say
[1:31:01] [cheering]
[1:31:02] [applause] the Lord HIMSELF SPOKE AND
[1:31:03] SAID
[1:31:05] I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I WILL NEVER
[1:31:08] FORSAKE YOU. I WILL GO WITH YOU UNTIL
[1:31:11] THE END.
[1:31:13] Praise be to God.
[1:31:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE KNOWS MY TROUBLE.
[1:31:20] He knows that he challenge.
[1:31:23] BUT HE GAVE MY PROMISE. I WILL NEVER
[1:31:26] FORSAKE YOU. EVEN WHEN I'M DOWN, I'M NOT
[1:31:30] FORSAKEN. EVEN WHEN I'M TROUBLED, I'M
[1:31:33] NOT FORSAKEN.
[1:31:35] When I GO HUNGRY, I'M NOT FORSAKEN. WHEN
[1:31:38] I LACK PEACE, I'M NOT forsaken
[1:31:43] because it is thus says the Lord.
[1:31:48] Praise be to God.
[1:31:51] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING. THAT IS MY
[1:31:56] BACKBONE.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT is leading me.
[1:32:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I KNOW EVEN WHEN IT IS dark
[1:32:06] and I try to LOOK TO SEE WHERE I'M
[1:32:09] GOING,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I can hardly see.
[1:32:14] Maybe it is a forget day.
[1:32:17] I'm seeing mirage on my way.
[1:32:21] But one thing I'm sure of the pillar of
[1:32:24] fire is leading the way.
[1:32:26] That pillar of fire is leading THE WAY.
[1:32:30] I DON'T NEED TO SEE IT WITH MY FINGER.
[1:32:33] I DON'T NEED TO TOUCH IT. I DON'T NEED
[1:32:35] TO FEEL IT. BUT I NEED TO BELIEVE
[1:32:39] that he is leading THE WAY. BECAUSE THE
[1:32:42] BIBLE TELLS US WHOEVER COMES TO GOD MUST
[1:32:45] RECEIVE that reward.
[1:32:52] PRAISE BE TO GOD. SOMETIME I tell God I
[1:32:57] am not a diligent seeker.
[1:33:00] I AM TRYING EITHER WAY.
[1:33:03] Even in this weakness,
[1:33:06] Lord, I'm trying.
[1:33:08] I am believing that you are.
[1:33:12] PRAISE BE TO GOD. I HAVE NO REASON TO
[1:33:16] [screaming] LOOK BACK.
[1:33:18] I'VE COME SO FAR TO LOOK BACK.
[1:33:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:23] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; AND I THANK GOD BECAUSE TONIGHT
[1:33:30] this is my story.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS MY SONG.
[1:33:34] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:38] I'm praising my savior all the time.
[1:33:42] Sometime my wife asked me
[1:33:46] sometime she asked
[1:33:48] how we going to go out to this
[1:33:53] but brother sister
[1:33:55] God is God.
[1:33:58] He is faithful.
[1:34:00] AMEN. [screaming]
[1:34:01] HE WILL SMITE YOUR ENEMIES.
[1:34:05] BLESSED BE THE NAME of the Lord.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; THE GREATER THINGS WE CAN DO
[1:34:14] RECOGNIZE OUR POSITION
[1:34:18] IN THE LORD. RECOGNIZE YOU WHO YOU ARE.
[1:34:22] RECOGNIZE YOUR POSITION.
[1:34:25] AMEN. THE DEVIL WILL NOT BE OUR MATCH.
[1:34:31] BECAUSE THE DEVIL TO DEFEAT US
[1:34:35] HE HAS TO FIRST GO IN THE MIND OF God
[1:34:39] because our plan of defeat,
[1:34:42] our plan of victory
[1:34:45] was planned WAY BACK IN THE MIND OF GOD
[1:34:49] of our victory.
[1:34:52] Way back in the mind of God.
[1:34:55] And in that ROOM
[1:34:57] WHERE GOD SAT WITH HIS ATTRIBUTE
[1:35:02] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[1:35:04] THAT'S WHERE THE PLAN WAS MADE. THE
[1:35:07] DEVIL WAS not there.
[1:35:10] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE DEVIL WAS NOT
[1:35:12] THERE IN THAT PLAN.
[1:35:16] PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:35:18] I CHOSE
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; NOT to back down. Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; MANY TIME WE want to fast feel.
[1:35:32] I feel like I don't have faith.
[1:35:35] He never told us to feel faith.
[1:35:38] He told us to believe.
[1:35:42] Amen. Amen. I feel like not praying. He
[1:35:46] never told you to feel like praying. He
[1:35:48] told you to pray.
[1:35:54] I don't feel like reading the Bible.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You don't need to feel like reading the
[1:35:58] Bible.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You have to read and pray that read the
[1:36:01] Bible and pray every day.
[1:36:05] AMEN. [screaming]
[1:36:06] AMEN.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID THAT LET US PUT ON THE
[1:36:08] WHOLE ARMOR of God.
[1:36:11] Put on your armor.
[1:36:15] There's no time to waste, brother.
[1:36:18] PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND I'M TELLING YOU,
[1:36:22] IF YOU ARE DOUBTING YOURSELF,
[1:36:25] you are going to make it in the rapture
[1:36:27] blood.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:33] If you are not, I will make it.
[1:36:39] Because he said so. He promised, I'm
[1:36:41] going to pray your place.
[1:36:44] Where I am, you come and be there. In my
[1:36:46] father's place, I'm a man.
[1:36:48] He never said that when I said for only
[1:36:50] brother.
[1:36:52] He never say I say that for brother so
[1:36:55] I'm going to make you.
[1:36:58] You see how gracious our GOD IS. IT'S UP
[1:37:02] TO you to put that you there.
[1:37:07] And when I READ THE SCRIPTURE
[1:37:10] I READ IT THIS WAY. I'M GOING TO HE'S
[1:37:13] going to make for me.
[1:37:18] Praise be to God. That's where we are
[1:37:20] going.
[1:37:23] We don't have time to waste here.
[1:37:26] Let us do our duties here,
[1:37:29] but knowing that we are going somewhere.
[1:37:32] I know we're living in a time
[1:37:35] when things are not like they used to
[1:37:38] be.
[1:37:40] But the Bible tells us Jesus Christ is
[1:37:43] the same yesterday is the same today in
[1:37:47] the same form.
[1:37:49] He will never change.
[1:37:51] His provision will NEVER CHANGE. HIS
[1:37:54] GLORY WILL NEVER CHANGE.
[1:37:57] AMEN. AMEN. THAT GOD WILL NEVER CHANGE.
[1:38:01] IS THE SAME ALPHA
[1:38:03] THE SAME JOHN
[1:38:06] SAY I AM ALPHA
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; AND I'M OMEGA I'M THE BEGINNING I'M THE
[1:38:12] ENDING THE ONE WHO WAS DEAD AND I AM
[1:38:15] ALIVE
[1:38:19] THAT [screaming] SAME JESUS
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; IS MOVING
[1:38:23] THE SEVEN CANDLES
[1:38:27] AMEN THE SAME GOD OPEN THE EYES
[1:38:33] THE SAME GOD WHO HEAL CANCER.
[1:38:36] The same God WHO HEAL THE SICK.
[1:38:39] THAT SAME GOD IS HERE.
[1:38:42] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:38:43] AMEN. WHO MADE THE DEMON OF GADA.
[1:38:48] A MAN WHO HAD MORE THAN 2,000 DEMONS.
[1:38:53] YES, SIR.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Do you realize
[1:39:00] that Jesus
[1:39:02] never wrestled with a man of God.
[1:39:05] That's what I told you that God is
[1:39:08] presence alone,
[1:39:11] demons will faint for.
[1:39:22] Praise be to God. And that's why THE
[1:39:25] DEVIL FIGHTS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT
[1:39:29] THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND YOU is weird
[1:39:32] atmosphere.
[1:39:35] You listen to
[1:39:43] King of your heart
[1:39:46] things like that.
[1:39:52] That's what the devil want
[1:39:55] because there you are going to bleach
[1:39:57] your hedge.
[1:40:01] He want to get access over you
[1:40:05] and from there he will show you
[1:40:08] that pastor has been preaching these
[1:40:10] sermons.
[1:40:12] Brother Luang and all other ministers
[1:40:16] but it's not working for you
[1:40:19] because your head is bleached.
[1:40:26] Praise be to God.
[1:40:34] Praise be to God.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Your fortress has been bleached.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That the enemy made a hole and entered
[1:40:44] into your fortress. Praise be to God.
[1:40:47] That's why you have clear atmosphere.
[1:40:52] You feel very weak
[1:40:57] all the time. You just get up.
[1:41:00] You just speak words and even wonder.
[1:41:13] has not changed brother.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] I always say that before rapture COMES
[1:41:23] I WILL HAVE TO overcome every demon and
[1:41:26] even step my leg on his their heads.
[1:41:32] We are not just running for a narrow
[1:41:34] escape to the rapture
[1:41:45] that we are counting each day.
[1:41:48] If the day comes to an end, we say, "Oh
[1:41:50] my God,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; NO SIR, GET YOUR BIBLE
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; AND GO READ WHERE THE Bible says,
[1:41:59] WE SHALL LAY OUR HANDS ON THE SICK
[1:42:02] AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. WE SHALL CAST
[1:42:04] OUT DEMONS IN HIS NAME." YOU HAVE NOT
[1:42:08] EVEN CAST THE devil
[1:42:11] and you are running away.
[1:42:13] You are obscing from your duty.
[1:42:23] You've not even visited even the nearby
[1:42:26] clinic
[1:42:30] to go see whether they are the sick.
[1:42:33] It is a promise here.
[1:42:36] Oh, let rapture come.
[1:42:39] BROTHER, SISTER.
[1:42:41] AMEN. WE are here
[1:42:46] TO STEP ON THE DEVIL'S HEAD. [cheering]
[1:42:52] [applause]
[1:42:54] You have no reason to step down.
[1:42:59] Praise be to God.
[1:43:01] The Bible tells us, "Hidden things
[1:43:04] belong to the Lord,
[1:43:06] but those which are revealed, they are
[1:43:09] ours and for our children.
[1:43:12] Brother, these things is revealed to us
[1:43:15] and this is our heritage.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; shall we rise on our feet?
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:48] Praise be to God.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I'll just end with this
[1:43:54] after the Israelite crossed the Red
[1:43:56] Seas.
[1:43:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:02] And sister Miriam looked back
[1:44:07] and saw their oppressor.
[1:44:10] How are they drowning in the sea?
[1:44:12] Their task masters
[1:44:16] who had BEATEN THEM
[1:44:18] FOR SO MANY YEARS,
[1:44:21] their commanders drowning.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:44:29] They never had reason to. back down.
[1:44:34] The Bible say that she got her tongue
[1:44:37] and she le of Israel
[1:44:40] and they danced.
[1:44:42] Praise be to God. The reason as why many
[1:44:45] times
[1:44:47] you feel like you you feel like not even
[1:44:49] clapping or singing.
[1:44:52] It's because you're still under your
[1:44:53] task.
[1:44:57] And then you're going to shout amen.
[1:45:00] Uh
[1:45:07] as you're going to shout, you look back
[1:45:12] now. I'm waiting for you. You shout I'm
[1:45:14] waiting for you outside
[1:45:16] physical type spiritual
[1:45:20] sometime when my son is disorganizing
[1:45:24] when causing case where I sitting
[1:45:27] I just looked at him like this.
[1:45:30] and he knows what will follow.
[1:45:33] So when you're still under the devil's
[1:45:35] yoke
[1:45:37] when you WANT TO SAY AMEN
[1:45:39] THEN REMEMBER what what so I'm so say
[1:45:47] when you want to clap your hands
[1:45:50] I said but my hands are it will pain me
[1:45:54] you look at your task masters
[1:45:57] because they are still
[1:46:00] praise be to
[1:46:03] Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; But when YOU SEE BROTHER BRIAN JUMPING
[1:46:07] AND dancing shout
[1:46:10] when he looks BACK HE SEES THE
[1:46:12] taskmasters drowning.
[1:46:16] That is the difference.
[1:46:20] PRAISE BE TO GOD. NOT WITH MARIAM.
[1:46:24] OH GOD, LET ME BE LIKE HER. BUT WHEN I
[1:46:27] SEE MY TASK MASTER,
[1:46:30] I will rejoice in the Lord. I WILL DANCE
[1:46:33] LIKE DAVID.
[1:46:36] AMEN.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord Jesus.
[1:46:41] Lord, we thank you for this wonderful
[1:46:42] moment.
[1:46:44] We thank you for the refreshment you've
[1:46:46] given us today.
[1:46:48] The Bible tells us you know our
[1:46:51] downfalling
[1:46:52] and you know our uprising Lord Jesus and
[1:46:55] you taught us by the prophet
[1:46:58] perfect strength and perfect weakness.
[1:47:01] We know that we are weak Lord.
[1:47:04] We have a big brother. We have a brother
[1:47:06] WHO IS GREAT. WE HAVE OUR big profile
[1:47:09] for us. We have a God who moves the
[1:47:14] God WHO LEVELS THE BODY. WE HAVE A GOD

[2:10:03] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:10:06] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:10:10] Amen. Glory to your name, Lord.
[2:10:14] You know what?
[2:10:16] I'll tell you a testimony right here,
[2:10:19] brother Polycup. You know, sometimes you
[2:10:21] do not know what the word does in you
[2:10:23] until until you are in a in a squeeze,
[2:10:27] in pressure. This morning, he just
[2:10:30] called me. He was the first person. He
[2:10:31] said, "Pastor, I want to talk to you. I
[2:10:32] have a I said, "Well, what is it?" He
[2:10:34] said, "Um, [music] I have a testimony to
[2:10:35] share with you." And then he begins to
[2:10:37] tell me the testimony. There's this
[2:10:39] friend of his, he's the only black
[2:10:41] fellow in the school where they are, in
[2:10:43] the university where they are in
[2:10:44] Pakistan. He came from a country called
[2:10:46] Togo. And so this young man is uh
[2:10:49] younger than he is and but you know they
[2:10:51] they go to the same class. And so he he
[2:10:54] came to him he was having a lot of uh
[2:10:57] stomach trouble and he was squeezing his
[2:10:58] stomach and he was he you know he he he
[2:11:02] made his way into his dometry. And he
[2:11:03] said please pray rather he said take me
[2:11:06] to the hospital try to help me. And you
[2:11:09] know he looked around all his friends
[2:11:11] the Pakistanis that he lives with were
[2:11:13] out of the dometry and he he never knew
[2:11:15] where our hospital was. He did not know
[2:11:17] what to do for his friend. And so he was
[2:11:19] there confused.
[2:11:21] But he remembered in that moment he
[2:11:23] remembered he has a God.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God. And you know
[2:11:30] what he told him? You know what? Let me
[2:11:32] pray for you. So he laid his hands on on
[2:11:35] that f friend of his and he prayed for
[2:11:37] him in the name of the Lord. He rebuked
[2:11:40] that sickness and the young man was
[2:11:42] instantly healed.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[2:11:48] And Polyap told me, he said he thought
[2:11:52] maybe the [music] young man was not
[2:11:54] sick, but you know when the young man
[2:11:56] left, he sent him a testimony and it was
[2:11:58] a long testimony. He read it for me. I I
[2:11:59] don't have a copy of it, but he said it.
[2:12:01] He read it for me. And and that boy was
[2:12:04] so touched and he said he now from that
[2:12:07] moment on, he will never [music] doubt
[2:12:09] that God is real.
[2:12:14] He's not even a message believer yet,
[2:12:17] but I can assure you he will receive the
[2:12:19] message because he has tested the God of
[2:12:21] the messages alive.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even you tonight, refuse to
[2:12:27] turn back.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, if others are turning
[2:12:31] back, some of us are moving forward. We
[2:12:34] are moving forward. Tell your neighbor,
[2:12:36] we are moving forward.

[2:22:23] the finisher of our faith. We give you
[2:22:26] praise, Lord. And even as we leave this

[2:22:30] continue on burning in our lives. And
[2:22:32] Father, even as we are going to give,
