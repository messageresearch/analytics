Jesus this evening we are going to be speaking on the subject of eternal life is living for others shall we take our Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 25 we are reading verses 31 we will read up to [Music] 46 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then I think you need to put put it down a little bit it's too too loud excuse me so when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the gods and and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the Gods on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was UNH hungered and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when so we thee un hungered and fed thee all thirsty and gave thee drink when so we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee Oh when so we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the Kings shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto thee unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall ye say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cast into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was UN hungered and he gave me no meat I was thirsty and he gave me no drink I was a stranger and he took me not in naked and ye closed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord when so we thee un hungered or at thirst or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you in as much as he did not did it not to one of the least of these ye did not to me and this shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life [Music] [Applause] eternal for for for for [Music] amen you may be seated I believe that the subject that I'm going to speak on today is a very important one especially for us as Believers and I'm just going to really ask you to follow through uh no need for you to move out you can really stay and and listen to some people say some portion is for another another portion is for another I believe every portion is yours tonight amen amen praise the Lord so I'm speaking on the subject of eternal life is living for others eternal life is living for others now even today there are many things you would have done for somebody but you did not do them because you asked yourself this question what is it need for me and the answer was nothing and then you decided not to do it I would not ask you to raise your hand but I'm sure that if I ask you to raise you may find that we have a lot of you will find that there are many people many Christians who do things because they benefiting personally individually you even find them ministering because they're benefiting individually you know you find them you know sweeping the church because they benefiting individually imagine you brother or you sister that has never swept the church if we are told you you are going to come and sweep the church and we shall pay you an amount of 500,000 a month I'm sure if I put if I put on a b board somewhere and we say that we we advertising a church cleaner amount 500,000 there are those who will not take the job but if we put 2 million there are those who would even me I can do it so you see it's not about the thing that you're doing that's benefiting us others it's about what you receiving for self-gratification but then if you are doing something and it is benefiting you individually you you are selfish and it's not benefiting others but as we shall see here a prophet told us clearly and I'm going to also show you through many scriptures eternal life is living for others you need to come to a place you need to come to a position whereby you are ready to sacrifice you are ready to do what it takes you are ready to get out of the way to do something even when you know you are not going to benefit individually it may be you're doing it for your relative or you doing it for your friends or you doing it for a stranger a to stranger I've I've been I'm one of the people that have you know been fed by a very angry generation angry not hungry you know whereby you can actually literally do something for someone and they will they can't believe it that you doing it for no private intention they will believe that you're doing it because there's something you are planning to do that will satisfy you as an individual because that's how you know it's it's been presented we have heard even the secular singers sing about it and they songs that nobody can have pity for another without a so you know everybody will believe how can he do that when he has no intention you know um I don't know whether I told you the story here but were just uh driving from a certain pastor's home and we were coming back home I had all my family in the house in the car sry and as we were coming we met a certain uh young boy sing maze it was a bit late at night maybe almost going to um 9 or 10 9:30 so it was a bit late for a school going a school going boy to be selling maze at that time so I I felt pity for him and I wanted to know I was interested to know his story so I asked him as we were taking fuel on the on the on the U machine and so I asked him a question I said do you go to school he said yes I go to school I told him which class are you in he told me the class I don't remember and maybe P5 or uh these also can't remember the ones I was with so then I I told him uh so you so as I was still talking they finished putting fer so then I packed on the to listen to the whole story and so he said to me that um so he sells maze in the night in the evening from the from around when he comes back to school from around 600 p.m. and he said sometimes he told me he he can you know go up to midnight because his mother you know Cooks this Maze and packs it for him so he cuts it on the head and then he doesn't go home until it is fully sold reason this is where how he makes his and so he told me of course while I was asking uh that so his father is dead and so he's an orphan and I as he was telling me the stories I was getting touched everything was saying and I felt I needed to relieve him so I told him now here is what we are going to do how much M do you have H he told me uh he showed me what he had he said he had the basket so he showed me the basket where it was quite plenty of it it was almost full and he had about you know 2 three hours to go and he remember he has to again go and sleep I don't know for how many hours and then wake up very early to go to school to me it sounded very very difficult and I know some of you have come from difficult backgrounds maybe like me maybe a few I don't know but I hope some of you and you know it can be quite difficult in such scenarios because um well I I not lengthen that but so I I so then when I as I was speaking to the boy I told him bring all your maze and I would like to buy all of it if I buy all of it would you be happy he look the whole time he was looking at me suspicious suspicious so he didn't I don't know did he think that I was lying to him so anyways he he showed me all the maze I paid it all and I I we took some and we give the rest of the border border men who were there the B Riders the motorbike Riders so they each of them now had a maze and they were Che and they were very happy and but for the boy he still looked a bit suspicious so I called him and I said uh um so how much do you do you pay for tution he told me his tution money and I told him I I said so so you've not paid anything he said yeah that's why I have to work late so that we can pay up so I I asked my wife for a piece of paper and a pen and I wrote my number and I told him take it to your mother and tell your mother to call me my intention was at least for only one time to support this boy with the tution at least for one time and I did not don't know that I had a lot of money but I wanted to do something kind to a stranger that I found in a position of need they never called me until today the reason I believe the boy must have been suspicious I I don't I I don't think he has ever met someone kind like that all his life and so I believe even if his mother had the story he must have told her him she must have told him it is too good to be true I believe you must have met these people who sacrifice little children so please my boy I want you to have knowledge in your head never do that kind of thing never do that again always when I give you go and say to people and bring the money after s so that way he lost his opportunity they lost their opportunity because perhaps they did not believe good people still exist but why did I begin with that story because I wanted to show you that we are living in a generation whereby almost people have become heartless people don't believe they can do something for someone when they are not going to benefit [Music] personally whatever you want to do you must make sure you're benefiting personally and if you're not benefiting personally you are not counted you just tell them don't count me in we want people who will come and sweep the church how much are we getting Don't Count Me In we are looking for people to do this and that how much are we getting nothing don't count me in but they want to be counted actually they you you would even have a number go go to people who are who you know call for interviews what I'm speaking today is very important and I'm praying that you'll give me your undivided attention if you go out they recently called when they were going to begin the population census and they called you know applications they had tens of thousands of applications and everybody is trying to see how can I get a job how can I get this opportunity others will even break others will do this others why because they are looking for that opportunity for themselves to get some money to get gratification to be satisfied it is all about self we are in a generation of self gratification you know people are doing things for themselves that's even why you find you know you know rap you you find rape you find prostitution you you find boys you know running after girls to use them dump them afterwards you know there's no commitment anywhere you find you know mothers who have children and they squeeze them out of their B Mur them before they even born and in countries like America they even say there's a whole political party called a democratic this one supports abortion open they even said they use it as one of the points of their of their campaigns they're saying a woman has a right on her body if she wants to up to her why you know it's all about selfishness you find they don't longer want to breastfeed why selfishness you know my breasts will fall down so I don't want to do that so they will buttered their children because they they are selfish they feeling that if I do this yeah the baby will be fine but I will look bad it is selfishness you see you see it's a spirit of the age you find that you know many things are happening like you know uh corruption is all about selfishness all these things that are really is I can call it the sickness of our Lan generation it is because people do not want to live for others but eternal life is living for others if you cannot live for others you do not have eternal life in but if you want to have eternal life you must have a heart like that of Jesus have a desire to leave for another person to do things for someone else to be happy that's where you find two two boys fighting over one girl or vice versa and no one is willing to leave it for the other many times while in counseling with young people I've told them this a prophet gave a scenario where there was um it was a hypothetical scenario and then he said if there is a you know a couple like a brother you know you have a sister and this sister you you really believe that she'll be your wife and both of you maybe you are almost in agreement to to make a decision and then eventually you know the sister comes and tells you brother I'm sorry you know but there's another brother you talk to me but there's another brother that I love better than you i' would rather go with him if you are a brother what would you do brother Marin what would you what the young men today they are willing to do anything and everything if they can't win the girl's heart they will rob it if they can't rob it they will squeeze it out and if they can't do that they will mess it up for him and for the other one at least if I can't take you let me go to the other one and I tell him how bad you are so that both of you both of us will lose it that kind of heart but our Prophet told us that you brother if you love that sister and and she tells you she loves another brother better than you what you should do brother is tell her you know what I love you and I want you to be happy so if you're happier with the other man that is all right by God bless you and may he give you a wonderful marriage you see what what what is that leaving fors if someone else is happy you should be happy now let us go to the scriptures so we see um we started with this scripture in Matthew 25 but we are going to read others when the son of man shall come now in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him shall he sit upon the throne of his glory so now here is speaking about the Lord coming down to sit on the white Throne judgment we we already talked about this in some other services and I told you that the white Throne judgment is not for the bride the bride is already uh in the Rapture and the Bride Comes Down to judge together with Christ but what we see here is um he says um and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the gohost and brother emphasiz this part and he says he said listen he said these are not sheep and these are not the gods but he says why because he said as a Shepherd are you following me and he says in this time of of of History here we are not dealing with sheep and goats but he says as a Shepherd is giving an example as a Shepherd the people is going to deal with not sheep the Sheep is already in his flock that happened in the Rapture so the people is going to divide as a sheep as a Shepherd divide sheep and gods on the white thr judgment is going to be those that were in the tribulation and then came up in the resurrection and some who had died before the tribulation this is when all the dead rise books are open and another book is open which is The Book of Life and now they are beginning to be judged and they were judged according to their works so in a way this portion of scripture is really not speaking directly about the bride but when brother bam was speaking about eternal life being living for others he also quotes this portion of scripture and he uses it as an example that eternal life is living for others and so and you know he says also that scripture has compound meaning you find one scripture meaning this but also having another meaning so this evening I want us to use this scripture uh to speak of the things that we do and the life that we live and how it can pay off so let us look at vers 35 okay before that it says and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the gos on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world praise the name of the Lord Brother Sam I would appreciate if you can reduce the sterio just the sterio okay and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the Gods on the on on the on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world now they are going to inherit the king of course whenever is talking about the inheriting the kingdom he's is's talking about eternal life so now when he's saying inherit the Kingdom he goes listen he goes ahead and he gives the reason why they should inherit the kingom he says for I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was stranger and you took me in I was naked and he closed me I was sick and he visited me I was in prison and he came unto me and now the wrer said Lord when did we see you hungry and we fed you oh thirsty and gave you drink when did we see you as a stranger and we took you in when did we see you naked and we Closs you when did we see you sick or in prison and we came unto you now listen closely friends the the people who did these good works did not do it because they wanted eternal life are you hearing me they did it un knowing that they were doing it unto the Lord so the people we are talking about here my I wish you just get it we talking about a people that in them was something that made them do something for somebody else and they had no reason why they were but they just had a good heart they just had a good intention they were not saying let me do this so I can go to heav no they were not having that premeditated mind look at it this way you know if you're a donkey you will behave like a donkey if you are a cat you behave like a cat if you are sheep you behave like a sheep if you a cockroach I hope no one would say I called them a cockroach you behave like a whoever you are you behave like what your nature tells you to behave these people here had a nature they had a nature a life in them that desire to do good that desire to live for somebody else that desire to make someone's life better than theirs desire someone else to be happy but by so doing they did not know they were doing it for the Lord but they did it without a premeditated mind but some of you you even just help a brother with only small some small money and he will sing it all over the church everybody will know you are the one who helped the brother or the sister where where have we arrived at where is this aspect of eternal life leaving for others imagine visiting the sick you know when you hear a brother is sick or a sister is sick or someone is hungry they have no food and then just say God bless you brother may God provide for you may God increase you but you can't even go into your pocket you can't go into your pocket and give what you have this generation is very selfish president it is very selfish someone before they give you something they want to make sure that they also have it it is competition like someone is competing with another one H what if we help them it is their wedding but we may give them a lot of money and they they have a lot of Glory more than ours you see it is selfishness but when you me have even never done a wedding now I I give this one how am I going to benefit it is selfishness it is a spirit of the AG but the bride should go beyond amen we should know eternal life is Desiring something good for somebody else did you know when you desire something good for someone else God will give you better God will increase you more God will bless you more but we are the way we are we never change because we are selfish there is no Giver that I have never seen I've ever seen many every Giver is always having enough that's the LA if you want to receive you must give out but if you don't give out you will never receive you will always be poor you will always be needy you will always be wanting but the Bible says it is more blessing to give than to receive even if you don't have something actually if you want to receive more than what you need give out more than what you have amen am if you need a five suits give someone one suit don't give give a bad one get him the best and you remember you will get better than that more than that that's what the Bible says he says give and it shall be given back you there is even a way he calls it it says it in luganda it will be shed up it will be yeah and it will be overflowing are you hearing amen that's how you receive back that's how you receive back but if your heart is holding on to something if your heart is holding on to what you have there is no way you going to get more than what you need but if you want more than what you need then give what you have and give what you can give and some people are very busy and very good at asking they never want to give they want to ask they want to ask they want to be given they they can even preach to you to give them brother you should give and be blessed but you also need to be blessed so you need to give every one of us need to be a giver not only one person all of us if we all want to be blessed we all must be givers I said we all must be givers they don't only give money you give time we have seen here just visiting a sick person amen just giving food to a hungry person giving water to a thirsty person amen receiving a stranger and making them comfortable and taking care of them but many of us when we see a stranger we don't want to spend time with them some people come in the church especially on Sunday and you you are the one running away from them every Sunday you want to be close to a person you knew the brother you know the sister you know go to the stranger someone that is new love them before they love you give them love receive them maybe that is Christ visitting and you don't even have an idea you know the Bible actually talks about M when he came to Abraham he didn't come to the house he was passing by but he wanted to visit Abraham but what was he waiting for he was waiting for Abraham to receive him amen he did not say Abraham can I come in but he was just passing by just passing by and Abraham saw him he received a revelation this is a stranger he must be tired let me receive him amen Sarah was not even aware they were going to have visitors but Sarah had a heart also that was knitted with the heart of the husband to receive strangers these days when women receive visitors when they not expect them it can be very terrible you married sisters always receive Strangers In Your Homes people you never plan to have yes I understand the food you cooked is not enough but if he's a stranger and God has permitted him to pass your away I don't care who that man is he may be a believer or an unbeliever but let me tell you brother sister the prayer you were praying amen is being answered by this stranger receive them receive them joyfully and Abraham said hey can you pass our way and while they came Abraham opened his eyes and he did not know he was opening his arms to Jehovah God praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord he was opening his eyes to Jehovah God the creator of heaven and earth when he huged him he had huged God himself did not know amen oh hallelujah amen yes sir we see that God had mercy onam said God would have killed her when she said no and laughed in her heart when this stranger came and and and and Abraham received him the stranger began talking to Abraham and said you'll have a child this time the next year and sah was in the tent and sah had that but in her heart she laughed and this being God had what was in Sarah's heart and he told Abraham why did sah your wife and said God would have killed her there are many reasons brother bam gives but I give you a reason here another why God wouldn't kill her you know what she was doing she was very busy dressing some food for these visitors as much as she because of lack of faith or Revelation she did not believe in what the god Jehovah God did not take her life because of her works because of her good works hallelujah amen he did not know this scripture can apply to as a stranger you took me in and she received them she received them and when she received them God began opening her womb her womb which was dead many years God began opening again did you not know when you have some dead situations in your life and you open your arms to a stranger you help a stranger you give yourself away for the sake of others dead substances began Amen to come to life dead wom begins to come to life and then slowly by slowly you may not know some of the blessings you had today amen it has been brooding in your womb because of what you did for stranger some years ago opening your womb to God's blessings simply because of helping a stranger praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I've wanted to preach on this subject for about um two months but the Holy Spirit kept on telling me not yet and today he told me it's the time and so I believe it's the time and I believe that it will be a blessing to somebody I may not even be done because I say I have about 30 minutes remaining but if I'm not done I'll just carry it on another day listen closely this is very important he said I was naked and you closed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me how many visit a sick brother how many visit a sick sister how many clothes give clothes to others who do not have some of you you you cling on to what you have the same cloth the same trouser you have it year after year until it tears breaks and then you now this one is finished it can be a rug no wonder you always have the same same cloes why because you're Clinging On To What you have pack some of what you have give it to someone else who does not have and before you know more will be powered into your life more than you thought some of you even have a lot you have kept in your house you've not dressed it for years but you still love it you still want it my clothes why it brings me old memories old memories when someone has nothing to dress Believers wake up eternal life is living for others and don't you dare say this message is for the other the other if God has inspired me this message is for you every one of you every one of you I told you I never preach situations I preach Inspirations and the Holy Spirit inspired me to speak on this tonight hallelujah hallelujah if you are keeping those clothes remove them from there clean up your house you're keeping them for years if remove them Park them properly if you have nowhere to take them take them to an orphanage do you know we have orphanages maybe there's no one who has ever visited an oranage now do you know an orphan have you ever been to one people who have lost their parents they have people who are helping them there you can take those cloes there your children have grown old and those cloes are now there very small cloes and they packing them 3 years to come when God gives me another child I will I they will use oh there is someone who is having a baby now and they don't have clothes for them remove those clothes sister take them out and give them to someone who needs them by so doing you do not know you do not know what you're doing you may be helping that little one who needs it don't pack up things in your house don't pack up things in your life yourself and out yourself Hallelujah because even God himself because he loved us he gave his only begotten son he out gave everything he had we must learn to be givers rather than holders and holders of things we have we have a Sea called the Dead Sea and this Dead Sea does not have any fish in it it is so salty you can't drink the water so dead there's no any living substance because it has no trib going out of it only water comes in but it can't go out but you in the same area you also have the Sea of Galilee it is just flourishing and it is a lot of life in it a lot of fish and living organisms because it's it has a lot of other rivers going out Brethren if you want to amen have life in you if you want to grow if you want to mature if you want to prosper you know you have to give your life has to be a life of giving it has to be a life of living for others now even if your amens are very small I'm going to preach it until every believer who is supposed to hear it will hear it verse 37 excuse me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when did we see you hungry and and we fed you so it's not that you're going to see God in this person you may not even see God in that person but just do it anyhow just have the heart just have the attitude and the King shall answer and say unto them in as much as you have done it unto one of the least ones of this my brethren you have done itto me now friends let me tell you this other people say I don't give because people don't appreciate is that not true you can actually give to someone and they will begin slandering you using the same thing you gave them you give someone a microphone and he uses it to slander you it's possible so does it mean now because people don't appreciate you should not give you don't give because you want appreciation never give because you want appreciation give because you have a heart to give the more you give the more you receive but also when you give he says that you are giving unto the Lord even if it offering here you are giving unto the Lord land fund or tithe or offering you giving unto the Lord some people they would even say I don't I don't give money to church what do they use it for do they even need it I don't give my money I just use my money to to to buy food and you see they're more concerned about what the money is going to do because they're selfish they do not know whether what the money is going to do will directly benefit them directly if they are not too sure they will not give them but if they tell him we are collecting money for a wedding that why I'm going to go and eat my food I will go and eat my food and when they giving they say now how much can I give how much is the plate plate is 20 let me give 25 at least I 20 I'll eat it and five selfish friends when you give I would give yourself this principle Brethren is a principle to Prosperity we've seen many of these Pentecostal churches Even in our country they're growing and doing great big things we know they think that that is success but we know that is not but we also understand that our God wants us to prosper in things spiritual and in things physical and even if you a very good prayer Warrior even if you you come to church every day but you do not give canot Prosper you as an individual and the church will not Prosper if the church has people who don't give you know the more opportunities the more needs that come and announced here is is a more opportunity for you to get more blessings you know so whenever you hear an opportunity there is a need that's an opportunity brother sister run and give as much as you can now you don't give let me give let me now wait for the blessing that's not the attitude the people who received all these things eternal life they did not give let me I get it they didn't even know they were going to get it they just gave out of the abundance of their heart and even the people who did not give and did not get eternal life they actually did not know that they missed it because of when when God came in a form of a stranger to them realize it when when God came to them naked they did not realize it when he came to them sick they did not realize it when God came to them in form of someone in prison they didn't understand that God can do that hungry and thirst they didn't understand that and and in as much they miss eternal life Matthew 5: 43 says you have heard that it has been said thou sh love thy neighbor and Hur your enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that c you some people say I will give only to my friends give even to your enemies even to those who don't love you even to those who are ready to say something against to those that cast you the Bible says love them and bless them do good to them that Hur you that he may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and he s the rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you am I preaching to someone here tonight do not even the publicans do the same and if you Salute Your bre only what if you salute if you greet what do you more than others do not even the publicans do so be there perfect tell your neighbor be perfect how do you become perfect you become Perfect by loving your enemy you become Perfect by doing good to those that hurt you you by praying for those who use by by by by by by praying for those who persecute you you become Perfect by helping those who cannot be who are unhelpable there are some people who are unable you help someone and they use it against you but help them anyhow do not oh Hallelujah do not let the gods pull you to their Lev if you a sh remain a sh amen if you were made to bleed never do like a god does I even stop doing what I was doing for them because they have done this to me continue doing well in you seon you will that is how you can only be perfect how can they do this to [Music] me even what I did for them I did so much for that person I gave him so much money I prayed for him I prayed for her I did that for them let me it doesn't matter what you did you did it unto the Lord if that person that doesn't understand it don't you worry your reward will come hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I want to imagine that Widow that Widow who welcome the man of God and even gave him a house to sleep did she actually know that this was a prophet of God she did not know but it was out of the goodness of praise the name of the Lord James 1 ver 27 pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself and spotted from the world pure religion and undefiled before God and the [Music] father this to visit the fatherless and widows in their [Music] Affliction amen that's pure religion to visit the fatherless to visit the what the fatherless to VIs to visit the fatherless if they are good to visit the fatherless I I believe we should see message Believers going to orphanages visiting them praying with them giving them clothes we shouldn't wait for missionaries from America we are no longer going to have them those countries have left go Europe they have left God you've seen what they did at the Olympics before they receiving the EIC gods of of Egypt and they now worshiping them God is no longer with them he's only with a little bride in those countries the missionaries are no longer going to come from those countries the missionaries are coming from among our amen younger men and women and older ones as well whoch and a vision this is what I'm going to do for the Lord I'm going to help orphans I'm going to begin visiting them you sisters you don't even have to be preaching go to these places and visit them give them literature do something for them well does it mean because we are looking for the rapture we shouldn't do this no eternal life is living for others you help a brother in church who does not have something instead ofing a brother that brother does not toess that brother has a problem stop criticizing dig into your pocket get money from there tell him brother here is go buy a suit sister a dresses don't do you know sometimes these sisters who dress like that is because they don't have clothes I did not know before but as I continue to interact you can get surprised someone will tell you this and the other one is all I have then you're like oh God forgive me for judging say go buy yourself another and then you'll be so happy but if you just sit there and say that sister is very can look at how she's dressing sometimes it's not because she's canel sometimes it is because she doesn't have can you leave for her in the Book of Luke chapter 10 ver 30 and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho you're going to read it and fell among Thieves and which stripped him of his rment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he saw he was when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came uh came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds and powering in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an in and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pens and gave them to the horse and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee which now which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed Mercy on him then Jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise amen you can read it also for for [Music] amen amen amen now I want to see friends this is a parable of a Good Samaritan and this man fell into thieves stripped of his wounded and they departed and leaving him half day and by chance there came down a certain priest that way a priest came you would surely say ah a man is going to help him but what did he do he just came and I'm letting I'm late for church he didn't have time for the wounded I preached on go out quickly on Su and I want you to hear my burden we have a lot of people that are wounded by circumstances by the Devil family background lives they went through things they went through people are wounded they've been stripped naked and they are almost half dead but many of us what do we do we just go by pass by P them I don't know maybe they were thieves and they were beaten maybe they deserved it maybe we have a lot of psychology and theology in our heads why we should not help these people but the people are perishing they dying The Souls of men both spiritually but also physically many people who need God friends the god that we have received the God we have this message we have the message is a message of life if this is true what have we done about they there they're dying in bus they're dying in in nightclub they're dying you know in deceit of the enemy they're dying in prostitution they dying in immorality they're dying in the pride of life and all these things but we the church we are very busy only going to church going to church going to church no one is reaching out but where will the Good Samaritan come from we only are looking for things which will benefit us and you know the priest came and left the came and left but there came this one man A Good Samaritan and when he came down amen he saw him he quickly went to him amen and he he bound up his wounds the B says he had compassion compassion on him to have compassion means your heart goes out to someone who is in pain and suffering your heart feels for them you don't know what to do you don't even have enough yourself but your heart goes out to them and you feel like even tearing what you have so you can share with them and compassion he had compassion on him and went and and went to him and bound up his wounds and he powered oil and wine and set his him on his own beast and brought him into an in and took care of him and on the tomorrow he departed he left some money behind he said take care of him whatsoever he spends I'll pay I will repay praise the name of the Lord now we know that this I can we I preached on it before when I was preaching on Rescue the perishing and can be taken in different directions but tonight I'm speaking about this in regard to having compassion for people I don't know whether that is the right interpretation having passion for somebody else not to have crude Hearts selfish heart self-centered but to just have a heart for somebody else if you don't have something think about somebody who doesn't have what you have and I and I'll read a quote before I finish here in the message that day on Calvary then what does it do it gives you after that condition he it gives you his Spirit to follow him and do as he did he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life Jesus was our great Samaritan so he gave his life and he made an example for you you know how he came we even have many songs we sing in him he came down from Glory a believing story my God and my savior came he came from Glory came down for a stranger such as I he lived for me he died on the cross he was beat for me he has gone all these things through for me for me he died for me he played for me he suffered are you hearing Church for me he went through all these things and he said he gave his life he was just one man one perfect man he gave his life he made an example for you so what must we do then we must do the same thing for others that he did for us now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself and I told you before if you live for yourself it fulfills you but there is no reward and if you leave for others many times they will disappoint you we will see it here Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others I just don't know about you but I want my life to be spent for others I want this to be my life's purpose I want this to be you know what I will be remembered for when maybe if the Lord ties and I'm long gone that I will be remember that my life was spent for others that's perfect eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that is fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come to the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and he receive eternal life by receiving that day on Calvary and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such a bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man I don't live for myself I live for others that I may redeem that man that woman that boy that girl I don't care what they call me you know what they called our lord Jesus they called him all sorts of names but he was leing for them regardless of what they called him regardless of how they treated him amen sister or brother if you ever do something for someone and you called all sorts of things you are in good company because even Jesus our lord went through it that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you are a son you are taking Christ's place you a son you don't live for yourself you are living for others where brother B can leave for this brother because he is sure a nice man that's not it leave for that man who hurs you leave for that person who would kill you if they could I wonder how many can say Amen to this leave for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him he died that he might save them that is eternal life when you that's in your awesome you are facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things you give them up like the sheep gives its wool and you look on and you look on towards [Music] Calvary I hope this helps you to get in a place what the Tabernacle that's what all people has to has got to do that's what DF all of us do I have 100% agreement in that is find out what you are and what's the purpose church is going to chur church just um Church isn't just going to church to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God and we must recall ourselves dead and alive to Christ he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service oh God may you give us this Revelation just sacrifice ourself ourself to his service to follow him you're going to be so Restless you want to find what can I do can I take care of the church flowers what can I do can I clean the church what can I do what can I do his brother needs help here his sister needs help here someone needs help here someone needs prayer someone needs to visit them and pray with them maybe Ser in the music or whatever what can I do you're going to be so Restless until you find something that you can do are you following me I will follow him we lead the life that he lived Jesus said and spoke of it let me just give you a few quotations on it listen close don't miss it said that that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the gods and he would say to the god stand on the left side and to the ship stand on the right side and he said to the gods depart from me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was in prison and you didn't visit me I was naked and you didn't clothe me and I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me and on the ship he said I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and minister to me and noce don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done I don't know how many got done said keep this in your heart for it was so unconscious mean their heart was just good the people don't do it for line of duty a man that gives you something another because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because you ought to do it no he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life it should be a very action you know you do something not because you have to do it you are doing it because it is your life I is your life it is your very action it is you your life that's how you are but how can it be if you don't have the Life of Christ in you it was so surprising to this sheep that they said Lord when were you angry and we feed you when were you angry and we fed you when we you naked and we give you cres and thiry and give you drink seek and minister to you praise the name of the Lord maybe sometimes you may hear brother is not doing well sister so so is or whatever don't just walk away at home I'm not very close to that sister I'm not very close to that give them a call visit if they in the hospital send them some money do something kind to that brother sister you were so automatically out of love your life lived in them God let the people see what Calvary did for us so automatically Jesus didn't do these things because he thought I have to do it it was his life it was his nature even if not want to die he felt I had to do it because I was born to die I was born to sacrifice myself for my brethren that is the same way we are born for what for living to leave for others your brother your sister someone oh Hallelujah someone you are not born with someone you have no blood connection someone Hallelujah that you don't even know will ever help you you do something for them in return there is a reward Brethren that's why I always say your real brother is your brother in the house of the Lord this is your family this is your family your family is not out there where you were born from you have families those that you will spend Heaven eternity we and amen we are born here and we have the same life that's why when something happen you feel oh this is my brother my sister I have to be there for them it's more than a responsibility it is so automatic it is a life when were you Lord when you when we never knew that Look what Jesus stand and said in in so much as you have done unto this you did it unto me unselfish life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and you are so alive in Christ and so walking on on the highway that these things are just an automatic thing you just do it not saying well now Lord would I want now would Lord want me to do that it's not that you are just a part of him his spirit is in you and you act the way he [Music] acted do you get it you act the way he acted and I want to finish with Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man SS that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in wello for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have there opportunity as we have opportunity let us do good unto all all men especially unto them who are of the hous whatsoever a man Seth that shall a man reap life is like planting a field let us plant good seeds let us plant good seeds whatever you saw it shall come back to you maybe you were never born with that person maybe you don't even have a relation to it don't say oh no me I give I give to my children I give to my wife that's what I'm talking about that's a responsibility that's a responsibility that's even why when you want to pay tithe you you you cannot say well I already gave the poor I gave them my tithe your tithe is to the Lord is not for you to help the poor help the poor from your own money after giving your ti as an offering then from out of what you have out of the abundance of your heart s into someone's life there are people in this life who have really lived a life for others when you look at their life they just Prosper not only the spiritual things but also in the [Music] physical they're just like that many of you I'm sure you have examples leaving for others is a secret that the devil has blinded from many Christians in the uh in the age of John wisley Philadelphia many Believers many Christians gave up their family their wives their children and I told them I'm going to India I'm going to Africa I'm going if I don't come back we shall meet on the and sister Angela they were not going for work they were going to leave for others and give them the gospel they were going to give them the word and by so doing by what they did praise the name of the Lord by what they did as they were doing many of them die but there a reward and because of what they did we have the gospel in Africa the whole church in Africa is because of those missionaries so we are here because of them we even we know we sing a song it's dripping with blood yes it's dripping with blood the gospel is dripping with blood many men and women have given themselves for this Holy Ghost Gospel and by preaching this message I I I don't believe that we should take advantage you know you understand sister Esther does decoration and then you tell our sister come and do decoration for me and then when it comes time for payment you're like ah sister leave for me just God will bless you I don't believe in that there are many believers who use other believers and they don't pay you are getting yourself a cast if you use somebody and they give you a service and they don't pay and you are a member of this church you are getting yourself cast the the Bible even speaks about about that you know employing somebody and you don't pay them the Bible actually says pay them while they still have their sweat pay them while they still have the sweat are you hearing me but many believers they don't want to do that let me get you the scripture praise the name of the Lord theonomy 24 I will end with that very important for me to end with this 24 15 let us begin with vers 14 Thou shalt know not oppress unhired servant that is poor and needy whether he be of thy Brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy Gates you see you have a housemate you know here in Uganda many families have housemates and you find a house a home where they oppress them because they a housemate when others are sitting on the dining and for them they sit in the corner there in the kitchen when others are eating a good meal she's the one who cooks it but they actually go and give up beans when they're eating meat because house you know and and when it comes to payment many people in Uganda here they never pay housem never you find that they will make them work and they do a lot of work and when it comes to payment instead of giving them 50 they will pay them 20 instead of paying them 100 as they agre they're giving them 30 and and this is someone with the money just even some of this workers security guards and other that some of them were even getting crazy and they were saying they don't know that we have the gun we can shoot them and actually one of them I think shot his boss because they're not getting paid and they are being oppressed by their bosses and the man will tell you that man is bad he's a bad man and if you a Believer and they give such a testimony on you you will not make it to heaven until you repent if you have any work or you are having anyone work for you you must always pay them and you must never oppress them as a matter of fact pay them more than what you agreed vers 15 H at his day at his day Thou shalt give him his higher neither shall the sun go down upon it for he is poor and Seth his heart upon it lest he cry against thee unto the Lord and it shall be seen unto thee so this is someone who is poor and is working for you and at the end of the day when the day arrives you tell them I'll pay you next week I'll pay you next week I'll pay you next week it is a sin and unless you repent you can't make it do you mean that Pastor yes the Bible says it will be a sin unto you Sinners are not going to go to heaven Sinners can't make it it's only the perfect be perfect as he is perfect by leaving for others and someone did you know that Believers must actually pay their workers on the same day they agreed if you can't dismiss them you can't pay them but if you are still having someone working for you and you agreed you you they must pay you or you must pay them on this debt then you must pay them as agree on the same day the sun should not go down because this man is poor this woman is poor and he's setting all his heart to this money is doing your work so you can pay him so if you don't pay him the Bible says they will cry to the Lord and when they do it will become a sin and so if some of you have been doing this kind of you even have to repent you have to repent sincer and change your ways I've had I've had Dr come to my house before when they were still living closer he was working at a clinic in a in a in a hospital here in ch so you would come at home and um uh he you know maybe checking blood for children and prescribing some medicine and then I asked him how much is it that you have worked know it's all right it's all right you are my pastor I'm just serving God I said oh thank you my brother God bless you and then afterwards I will pay him more than I knew he needed he served I blessed him but I also paid him for his labor the Bible tells us to pay our workers for their labor that's even why we pay tith we are paying for the ministry to continue ministering to us because our 10% goes to support doesn't go to construction it doesn't go to build anything it goes to support the ministry of the word that's the purpose and and and the Bible says don't do not Mule the ox that Tre the [Music] corn praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's just read that verse um because he cannot get the the the translation in the book of Deuteronomy CH 25 uh vers 4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn and is that verse completed it's completed yeah it is it is it is trading the the is digging it's working for you and then you just you begin mistreating Apostle Paul pulls that scripture and he uses it in talking about servants in connection to preachers who preach the gospel how they should reap the physical things from you just like give you the spiritual and it's the same way also with our workers because a pastor or a preacher is supposed to be a labor is working for okay now let us take that interpretation in the book of 1 Timothy Chapter 5 this just came up I had not prepared to but I think 1 Timothy chter 5 ver 17 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they that labor in the word and Doctrine for the T says Thou shalt not musle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the laborer is worthy of his reward so you see you need to pay your labor don't mistreat your car or the the the ox that is working for you just like you love your pastor you pray for him and you pay your ti to support the cause and in the same way if you have a worker in your house you must do the same love them you knowk them for the good work they them the full of the agreement the same day asement are rules that Believers follow even when you have a company to those of you have businesses listen you have to pay your workers as per agreement there are some companies that take so long and you work and you have paid the following month after two months you have already used the money again Believers should never do like that as much as yes life is living for others on this other side you should not make someone labor and you don't pay them because you are leaving for them God bless you that stand feet I just trust that that little sharing has been a blessing to you all and uh if some of you have been you know found wanting in some area correct it right away and the Holy Spirit will help you to be able to do that amen [Music] I'd like us to pray [Music] and if you have something that you'd like to present before the Lord please do that as we pray together our dear Lord we want to thank you so much for the service this evening little things that we have shared they're very important father for every hearer I'm praying for them today that this would not be a judgment to them but let it be a Salvation to them that they will correct whatever they have done wrong and you will let your Holy Spirit mold out a character a life out of us and we shall be able to live for others father God this is such a message that comes to instruct us and to ground us in our Christian faith let the let these things be unto us according to your word in Jesus name amen hallelujah hallelujah there's a song I wanted to sing I don't know if we have
