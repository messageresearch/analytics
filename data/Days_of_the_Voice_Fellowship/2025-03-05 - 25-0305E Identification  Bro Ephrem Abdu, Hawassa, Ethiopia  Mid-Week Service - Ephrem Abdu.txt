to glorify people we came to glorify God only him deserved the glory him and him alone Hallelujah hallu God bless you you may be all seated hallelujah hallelujah I am extremely happy to be here as I was invited to stand and Minister here I was thinking the first time I come to Uganda the first time I came here I came to Pastor T's house and he told me we were going to have a service and I thought we were going to some church so in the morning everybody WS up they organize the table I don't know if there was a Pulpit there was a ppit somehow there was a chair and it was in the midst of the house and I was very surprised he came from Ethiopia he planted the church there and then now he's coming here so I just saw everything he did the song leading by himself he did The Prayer by himself he did the preaching by himself so I said amen and when the second time he called me I was expecting that same testimony and I went back to their home that second time it was that church what is the place yeah that that the church and surprisingly in just short amount of time there were people and for the first time I saw the PO translating I said this is not a man this is godu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God bless you I'm always happy to be back here I was the conference I just understood God has a lot to do here in this a lot of things to do in theow Hallelujah there is an army rising up not an army rising down our Our Calling is not to go down our calling is to go up there is many things that is calling us down many things that is calling us to sit down there is many things that is going to make us a slavery but I'm thankful to the Lord that he give us strength to stand up rise up hallelujah amen God bless you things from the message of the Cross tabac Mage the tacle the thingss hallelujah hallelujah and there some of them they have known you from the YouTube and they know the testimony very well if God allowed it they will come and visit you Hallelujah God is so good if you allow me I would like you to stand up and we read from the scripture verse The Gospel of John chapter 1se we read it in the name of Jesus and this is the record of John when the Jewish Saint priest Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are thou and he confessed and deny not but confessed I am not Christ and they asked him what then are you Elijah and he said I am not are you thy prophet and he answered no then they said unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself and he said I am the voice of the one crying in the wildness making straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah amen for [Music] Heavenly Father we thank you we bless your name we have here to hear from you may you use me as a vis may you speak to the people you reveal the word to them take me aside and speak yourself in the name of Jesus Amen you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah today I fa to speak on identification and age we live in some of them they don't know their identification we have boys saying we are girls we have girls that's saying we are men they don't know either they are woman or men so you know the age we living in has sto some of people's identity and it's a very important time that we need to have an identification even in this world where we living someone who doesn't have an identification ID he will not be known where he's coming from he will not know no one will know where this come this person is coming from in some countries it's illegal to be found someone with no identification so it is very important to have an identification identification that you have come from somewhere and if we know we have come from somewhere we know where we are going and the prophet say if we came from there we go back there but if you are not called from there we will not go back there so it's very important have an identification Hallelujah so that is the question John is being asked they come and they ask him and these people are not just normal people from the road these are teachers these are religious people so they don't use any kind of words they bring the scripture to him and they ask him are you Elijah because in the Bible in the Mali the Malachi spoke of Elijah God will send El so because they know the scripture very well they asked him are you this so he said no okay okay if this guy is saying no also Moses quoted God will rais a prophet like unto me so they asked him are you that prophet and then he said no so these people were confused because the way John is uh the character of John is telling them he came from somewhere in the scripture and because they know the scripture now they are confused to find where should we find you in the scripture the real question they want to ask you is where should we find you in the scripture Hallelujah so John gave them time to discuss after they dig out the scripture they couldn't find who John was so John replied to them and John didn't say I am the father of um somewhere my mother is Elizabeth I came from the jungle I eat honey I live a normal life yes he's a man from The Jungle yes he lives in the desert but he didn't use those things to identify himself Hallelujah am so I'm here to tell you today whatever you're going through will not identify you your identification is the scripture your identification is the word of God hallelujah no one can give you an identification the government cannot give you identification your mother cannot give you identification your identification is from the word of God came from God you go back to God hallelujah amen that's why you are special people you have a special identification you don't refer the word to identificate you you don't use education to identify you you don't allow situation to identify you you allow the word of God to identify you Hallelujah you are not what people say you are you are not what the church says you are you are what word say hallelujah so I'm here to tell you sit back relax and hear the word of God hallelujah God bless you Hallelujah so John didn't say I came from my mother Elize but he came from his mother and his father was a minister his M his father was a man who had a word from the angel his father was a religious person he didn't tell these people I came from zakar I came from the bishop I came from this church my father has big church he didn't allow those things to identify him Hallelujah I will tell you something today your identification is the word of God hallelujah and these people to ask this this different question they use the scripture to come they use the scripture to come to John and they ask him who are you what's where where should we find you they use the same scripture they use the same Bible that John is using they use the same Bible that John is reading they have read Isaiah many times and John has they know Isaiah before John was born people know the scripture better than but when John was reading the scripture and when he opened the book of Isaiah and he read the book that spoke about him that book was a different book for him yes he used the same Bible but when he read it for himself that scripture he seem very well he say this scripture is familiar this is not something new Hallelujah that's why in the message we don't make people become a message Believers we don't make them seed we don't have the power to make them the seed because it is God who give them that seed allow them to hear the word of God so for us our job is to open the reveal word and them if they respond they are the seed of God if they don't respond we don't judge Hallelujah so we don't make message Believers but we preach to the message and they will receive the word of God hallelujah so when John was reading that book when he read the book of Isaiah it was something different about that book it was not speaking to another person yet his name was not in that scripture it didn't say this scripture is written for John the Baptist a father of Zar it was not written that way that why when the scripture come when the Pharisees they came and they read the same scripture that John is reading it doesn't reveal to them anywhere because it was not talking about them it was talking to a specific individual so when John is reading that SCP the word was becoming flesh in him the word was manifesting in him hallelujah amen there is a difference for instance um whom can I use shame sorry for using your name brother shame recently became a father now his wife is being in her family now if brother shame wanted to write a letter for his wife he will have a lot of things to say so when he's writing that image he just says I love you my wife and he sent that email orer to his wife now when his wife reads that scripture when she reads that letter she knows it was not for everyone she knows it was specifically written for her and she knows he has a lot of things to say the unwritten letter she will read it what he meant to say she will understand Hallelujah am what is it it is Called Love they are loved now for let's say something happened when when he was sending a a message maybe that letter fall on the ground and someone picked it up he read the message he will know the the message for him it doesn't give that sense oh Hallelujah it was not giving any kind of sense so the Pharisees couldn't find the sense so they have to go to this man to explain to them who do you say you are tell us who you are Hallelujah so for him when John was reading Isaiah he knows this letter was written for he say I am the voice that cries in the wilderness Hallelujah that scripture was talking about it was not talking about any other people so that scripture hallelujah amen we thank the God so many people they will come to the message they will read the same they read the same Bible but cannot find the sense hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why you are specific you special people chosen for a special work Hallelujah let's read some quotesu hallelujah hallelujah um the prophet here speaks about reading between the lines in uh Redeemer and Redemption 55119 it says like this like to read between the lines the best part of the Bible is wrote between the lines H I love this message I love this message because John was reading the same Bible but the couldn't understand Hallelujah but they know the scripture more than him but for him when he's reading he sees his name there but for them when they reading they don't see their name there Hallelujah so this is why the prophet is saying the special part of the Bible right between those lines Hallelujah and for you to have that uh to able to read that scripture you need Revelation Hallelujah and Revelation is not your opinion Revelation is not knowing the book Revelation is not going to school Revelation is a special Union a personal relationship between you and Christ Hallelujah so when John was reading that book he was reading between the lall Hallelujah what did he read he wrote he read his name in the whatever that Bible is referring to he knows this scripture is not for he know this scripture is talking about Hallelujah and the prophet here says do you like to read between the light the best part of the Bible is wrote between the lines as I told you the other night the Bible is hid from every Seminary you don't know God by Seminary experience you know him by being born again experience hallelujah hallelujah so today you are not taking a lecture from theology experience today you are taking experience from Born Again Brothers Hallelujah I don't have any paper to show you I don't have any knowledge to tell you but one thing we know we can read between the lines and in the middle of the line I see my name I see myself and that is my identification Hallelujah that is your identification amen let's continue in 5443 the hand of the Lord comes upon him that's a title The Prophet says like this now this is between the lines friend that is the reason they fail to recog recogniz Jesus Christ when he comes they did read the scripture about it they fail to recognize him it is the same thing today we go we get we get our own ritual routines anything outside of that we don't believe it fundamentals as we can be God comes right in between the lines sometimes we fail to see it Hallelujah they read the same scripture in the the church they tell the people that the Messiah is going to be born and they C the scripture but yet when the Messiah was there they couldn't recognize him because they were reading the literal letters were they were not seeing what's between the lines that's why I told you my brother sham and his wife because of that love because of that Unity they have she knows what he has wrote for her it could be a simple letter but she knows what is going in his head understand what he's trying to say to Hallelujah sir I love reading for you quotes allow me to read some quotes possessing the gates of the enemy paragraph 29 it says the Bible is a special book Hallelujah this Bible we reading it is a special book Hallelujah huj I want to say it again this Bible a special book hallelujah hallelujah because it's not talking about another church it's not talking about some Bishop it's not talking about a certain people it's not talking about any other thing this scripture is a special book because it tells about you you see your life here you see your name here it identifies your life hallelujah it's a supernatural book The Prophet says it is written so that it hides from the schools it's hidden from the school andology Jesus thank God I thank Father thee that has hidden this from the wise and and God has revealed to babes learn he's saying it's a book of love when the love of God comes in your heart then you fall in love with God hallelujah it didn't say you read and then you fall in love it says the fall the love comes to you then that will reveal himself to you when you love him that will drone him come to you and when he comes to you he will reveal something to you that's why he tell them don't go to theology we see we didn't see them they go to theology we didn't see them going to schools I didn't get it we didn't see them we didn't see them then going to schools we didn't see them going to theology schol we didn't see them God electing an educated people God has left those and come to a people who can love him Hallelujah he's not looking for Education he's not looking for the ABCs he's looking for someone who can love him Hallelujah the reason that he loves us is so he can reveal his mystery to us you don't tell your secrets to the people you you don't love people you don't have chemistry with for you to to tell something for you to reveal yourself to someone that person has to love you when they love you they know you Hallelujah [Applause] that's why God says he loved the world so much that he gave his Beyond Hallelujah and Jesus Christ didn't come for everyone Jesus Christ didn't shed his blood for everyone he prayed like this I Pray father that you may reveal this things to those I have I have revealed yourself Hallelujah Jesus Christ was not going everywhere and telling them see me see me those who understood those who loved him the most were able to understand the mystery Hallelujah they say we should not just follow him we should not just eat with him they said we should not just minister with him there is something special about this Hallelujah that's why Judah was not a bad person Judah was a very religious person he never smokes he never fought with anyone he was a religious person but before we speak about Judah the Bible says when Judah dies he went to his place he went to his identification but he tried to identify himself with the word he tries to come to church he tries to pay his he even say this one is not enough for God I have to put an own a suit I have to buy the Bible and I have to preach the people until he preach so he was preaching he was preaching the Clos book and people were shouting amen amen so Judah was not a bad person Judah was a good person but you see he was not identified he was not meant to identify with the word so when he joined the disciple he was at the wrong place when he was ministering he was at the wrong place when he's using the word he was at the wrong place when he was trying to identify himself with the scripture he was a WR so God waited for the time to reveal who this man was because one of the principle Jesus had was for the whe and the seed to grow together they grow together but one is identifying God one came from God one from God hallelujah that's why k never repented not because he was very muscular or very rebellious he was a religious man but in him inside the doesn't have any space for repentance he was not there to identify himself with this so the first Mark we see that God has applied was he put on the mark and he went the Mark will be applied those who cannot repent those who cannot be baptized in the reason they are not baptized in his name is not because they are stupid it's because they don't see their name in his name Hallelujah but for you when the name is called you will say Amen because that is your identification Hallelujah you identify with him in burial you identify with him in Resurrection Hallelujah your job doesn't identify you you go through doesn't identify that's why they identify Jesus as a carpenter they told him this is a son of Joseph that's what we know they are not wrong they identifying the man with what He surround himself Hallelujah so you your name is in the scripture Hallelujah your name is in the scripture Judah couldn't find [Music] himself that's why you see him sometimes could I be here can I be there can I use my gifts to get some money that's why we get so amazed today when some so called Prophet comes and he says youing sister rise up your name is so and so your name is so and so and that lady will shout that lady will say God knows my name but yet he has called her name in the scripture but people refer Prophet calling out names so if they don't call their names so if they don't call their names God doesn't know God doesn't know if God knows her how come I not be known that is the deception we have today that is a decision we have today in the church people are there to be called names by person and I get so confused because when God calls whenever I hear his voice I know it was for a hard time it is he's going to speak something against my flesh he's going to tell me something to do against my flesh he's going to tell me something I did not from my will that is a voice I know the voice comes with an instruction Hallelujah so that's the voice I know there are times I said when when I'm going to hear that there is some atmosphere I'm going to be in when that and when that voice comes there is a certain fear I have there is certain fear I had and when that voice comes it comes straight forward against your will against your flesh the the voice of God is not used for jokes it's not used just to call out your names when the voice comes he comes for a work when the voice comes he comes to do something Hallelujah right hallelujah hallelujah so that's the voice God has hallelujah hallelujah so Judah preached the word people were saying amen rece he said even now this one is not enough because I know Jesus I had to go to people's house I have to pray for them I go to their lives I prophesy to them but yet Judah was not identified with Christ he tried to be with Jesus yet he was not let's read the scripture about Judas 1 ver Acts chapter 1: 24 and they prayed and said thou Lord which knows the heart of all men shows whether of this uh thou H has chosen that he may take the part of this ministry and apostleship for which Judas by transgression fa that he might go to his own place and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon the Matas and he he was numbered with the 11 apostle so Judas was not meant to be the disciples but he tried to identify himself he tried to say I'm the preacher he tried to say I'm the follower of Jesus Christ he was not but those who were deceived as much as he can he has deceived hallelujah amen you know Mary was a special woman the the angel could go to many womans but he chose specifically to come to Mary Hallelujah and when the angel of the Lord could to comes for an individual he comes for a specific work Hallelujah after the angel has left her Mary was not the same now Mary has a message Mary has a message for her day Hallelujah so whenever we read read the book of our Prophet brother Bram we read it we cannot be the same when the angel of the Lord comes to an individual it comes to change your lifeall it comes to change your life it comes to change your appetite that's why Mary after she received the word her appetite was changed she was telling her husband this food now I can this one is not for me it was the word that is making her to do that because the word that she has received has pregnated her and hallelujah hallelujah what going to be born it was going to manifest Hallelujah the word that we are reading is not just for hearing it has to be made flesh in your life hallelu people so much focus on the 2,000 years of Jesus Christ where the word made flesh but right now also the word is becoming flesh Hallelujah the word is becoming flesh in you Hallelujah when they are quoting Jesus they are quoting you when they are quoting the scripture they are quoting you your name is in the scripture your name is in the word you didn't come from somewhere you didn't come from somewhere from the Bible you came from the word and you go back from hallelujah hallelujah the devil has once deceived us he took us away from our identification he took us away from the scripture but God has said I will not leave my people alone I will not leave my people alone I have heard my people's cry I have heard my people's cry I will come down myself Hallelujah God has come down with a message to restore us back to our position hallelujah our position is the scripture hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why I thank God so much hallelujah hallelujah he gave us a second opportunity to become like him Hallelujah not to become your father not to become your sister Hallelujah but to come your maker hallelujah amen that image is being restored back Hallelujah your identification is his image and you are going back there Hallelujah is my time okay all right Mary when the word comes it changed her appetite it changed the way she lives what she was eating she changed this is not for me the angel has come and he has spoke the word to me and right now I'm not like any other woman Hallelujah she's a special because the angel chose her you are special because God has chosen you you could have gone to Seminary he could have gone to the big palaces but he chose you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he choses you and Mary identify herself with the word that it was spoken she know she was not like any other she say I'm not like any other woman woman that God has chosen so when I'm going to the kitchen it's for a purpose when I'm going for church it's for a purpose when I'm doing my work it's for purpose you are here for purpose to identify God on Earth Hallelujah to represent God on Earth hallelujah hallelujah but right now A Unity is happening a is taking place hallelujah hallelujah what is that Unity it's for us to recognize our head Hallelujah the bride recognizing her head Hallelujah it is a Time the prophet has said it's a uniting time where the body and the comes United Hallelujah that the bride knows her identification is ahead [Applause] Hallelujah let us read some scripture I'm going to jump many things I read this one Genesis chap Genesis 24 verse 61 24: 61 and RKA arose and her damsels and the Rope upon the camels and the followed the men and the servant took Rebecca and went with uh went his way and Isaac came from the way of the well lar for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to Med uh to meditate in the field at the uh evented and he left up his eyes and saw and behold the camel were coming and Rebeca lifted her eyes and when she saw Isaac she slightly uh she lightly off the camels for she she said unto the servant what man is that WTH in the field meeting us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself Hallelujah you can read for she took the veil and covered herself why you see was not looking for a a beauty on the field he didn't came out with the mindset of who is the beautiful one El was sent to look for a character that will fit the head Hallelujah so he was looking for a character when this message is coming to us it was not to tell us we need more education or that it was to tell us that we must fit that head Hallelujah it was looking for a character that will reign with Jesus Christ Hallelujah a character that was the church that he is having that was the search so Ela went for looking for a character that will fit the head amen hallelujah I'll read this and I'll finish in the message the seven churches Church the prophet said swe it out until he found that's right Hallelujah he he his intention was not anything how good she is or how smart she is he was looking for a church that will fit the head our Lord Jesus Christ that will obey him that will obey his word that will say Amen to the word that will say Amen to the word hallelujah hallelujah so swe it out until he found character who would he get and he trusted God and the character for what for Isaac which is the type of the church that was the natural Seed of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of Abraham the messenger hunting the bright and trying to find character if that man is come the messenger of the last day trying to find the bride of Christ he will not look for the denomination member will look for the character Hallelujah and that is the will of God character is the will of God without character we cannot rent Hallelujah character will identify us with Christ your character will identify us with Christ that's why they came to John because his character was somehow telling them something so they have to come to him and they tell him who are you see sometimes we fail from our identification because we think it's so hard there is times we fail in life there is times I I have gone to this I have given my life for this but nothing is adding up and the devil sneaks in makes his way and make us fall from our that's why God is full of grace when he called Adam Adam was not in his position Adam lost his position so when God came to the ID he didn't call Adam a sinner he didn't identify Adam as a sinner because he know it was the devil purpose to take him down if it was the devil he would said you you sinner you have sinned God will not love you you are a sinner God will not never love you but when God comes he called him Adam Adam where thou his sin never change his identity Hallelujah his situation never changed his identity God didn't say now he has done this Mist let me change from Adam to Jacob never change his name God said Adam are thou there is a calling even going now Hallelujah where are you where are you where are you hallelujah hallelujah hallu you are called by God and God is waiting for you to respond Hallelujah when you respond you go back to being in your position you allow God to lead you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you love God do you love God he loves you he loves you you are called by him you know when the Bible says it didn't say people that pray and then I will answer but he said people that are called by my name people that are called by th name Hallelujah when your name is there when your identification is there then God will come down to answer you Hallelujah he will never come quick or he will never delay he always come on the right side [Applause] Hallelujah let us all stand hallelujah hallelujah let us raise our hands God I came to hear from you the devil tried to identify us with he tried to identify us with the word the world with the sin Lord come down again and change our ID we are not called from the world we are called by God God come down break the chains of slavery break the chains of Burden Lord whoever comes to your name Lord May them rest may you give them the power to rest let them be secure secure in your name let them be secured in your identification there is no other thing that will protect us Security will not protect us the door will
