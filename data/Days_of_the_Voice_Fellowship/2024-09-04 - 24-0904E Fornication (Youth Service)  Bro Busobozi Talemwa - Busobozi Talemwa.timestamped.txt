[36:11] to sing that's beautiful God bless you
[36:16] appreciator amen wonderful you may be
[36:19] seated for just a
[36:21] moment
[36:24] amen I we have some Empty Chairs here
[36:27] and some
[36:28] young people are hiding behind the
[36:32] pillar we usually you know I'm praying
[36:35] that God will give us our own place
[36:38] soon because this one is Con
[36:41] constraining
[36:44] us sometimes you know you have these
[36:47] pillars and some young people know how
[36:49] to sit
[36:51] strategically where the pastor can't see
[36:54] them and they hide behind the
[36:58] so if you know you are behind the
[37:00] pillar kindly come and use the SE
[37:03] front that will be one if I can't see
[37:06] you you can't see
[37:09] me so I'm requesting you to
[37:11] come anduze these
[37:14] seats right here I'm hoping I'm speaking
[37:17] to those that are
[37:21] hearing amen I'll just give you a moment
[37:23] to do
[37:24] that even sister peace I think I can't
[37:27] see you properly
[37:35] bless
[37:36] Youk those should be your seats
[37:39] always yeah those should be your seats
[37:42] always praise the Lord I see uh most of
[37:46] the mothers and fathers have boycotted
[37:48] our
[37:52] service but I appreciate the uh the
[37:55] mothers that have come
[37:58] God bless
[37:59] you I I want to correct
[38:02] something whenever we say we have a
[38:05] youth
[38:07] service it does not mean others cannot
[38:12] come it means that everybody should
[38:16] come as usual but the only reason why we
[38:21] announce is because we want to let you
[38:23] know we are going to concentrate on that
[38:25] specific group
[38:31] the only services that are exclusive are
[38:33] the married coupl
[38:38] meetings whereby if you're not married
[38:40] certainly you are not going to uh need
[38:43] whatever will be talked
[38:47] about but for the for the Youth
[38:51] Services everyone is usually welcome to
[38:56] come and um also when we organize youth
[38:59] meetings we don't you've noticed that
[39:01] even other people
[39:04] come it's not only exclusive to
[39:07] the
[39:11] youth yeah it used to be some thought
[39:13] that it is only for the unmarried
[39:19] people or for the younger
[39:21] people but um it is for
[39:25] all it is for all because whatever will
[39:27] be shared certainly blesses
[39:31] everybody and some things we talk about
[39:33] cuts
[39:37] across and you find that and figure it
[39:39] out that it is very helpful
[39:43] for so we have um I have
[39:46] um about an
[39:50] hour and I have several questions
[39:54] here that I have that receiv
[39:58] received from those on the youth
[40:00] meetings
[40:05] groupsa and um some from the
[40:09] church now I'm going to request um that
[40:12] you share with me the questions that you
[40:18] have as quick as possible just right
[40:22] now if you have already it just send
[40:26] it come up and help gather those
[40:30] questions and then you um if you have a
[40:33] if you have it written just raise
[40:36] it if you need a paper raise up your
[40:40] hand and then brother Al
[40:44] will uh the purpose for this
[40:47] service we usually have these kind of
[40:49] Youth
[40:51] Services the purpose for it you know is
[40:54] to Target the young the youth
[41:00] um to edify
[41:03] them to encourage them and many times we
[41:07] do it in the in the
[41:11] holidays I think in the coming in the
[41:14] near
[41:16] future I'll be arranging uh uh it's been
[41:20] on my heart for some
[41:22] time especially when I see the need here
[41:26] among our young people
[41:29] and also I see many Ministries that can
[41:32] be a blessing to the
[41:37] youth and sometimes it is difficult to
[41:39] bring all of them in a youth convention
[41:42] or youth meetings that we
[41:47] make because I mean you imagine we have
[41:50] only one weekend
[41:53] inth in a youth youth camp
[41:57] so you cannot have say 10 people or 20
[42:01] pastors or preachers speaking to young
[42:07] people so we can only have so
[42:11] many so this this year I think we are
[42:13] going to have the
[42:16] most and I'm sure there will be a
[42:19] blessing but I also know
[42:21] others that I've desired in my heart for
[42:24] them to come
[42:27] and be a blessing not only to our
[42:31] congregation but also looking at other
[42:35] churches other some of our
[42:39] churches um you know having these
[42:42] ministers knowing that they can be a
[42:44] blessing to
[42:49] them if you pray God will answer your
[42:53] prayer and we shall start having many
[42:56] youth
[42:58] uh
[43:02] conferences uh where we can invite also
[43:05] from other
[43:08] churches um young people from other
[43:12] churches and they just all come and join
[43:15] us and um then we have you know guest
[43:20] speakers um so that we could make it a
[43:23] bit
[43:25] small uh not like the youth come the big
[43:28] youth
[43:30] come where we camp there for several
[43:33] days so let's pray over that and see how
[43:35] the Lord will lead
[43:37] us but for now I've just been taking
[43:39] these Services you know speaking what
[43:41] God has laid on my
[43:45] heart and I want to believe it's it's
[43:48] been a blessing to those who can
[43:52] hear in
[43:54] luganda we have uh they have
[43:59] proverb which
[44:04] says who is cancelled cannot die cannot
[44:09] perish fully cannot perish
[44:13] holy if somebody has been canell or
[44:17] guided that person cannot
[44:21] perish if someone is going to go if
[44:23] you're going to go and
[44:25] perish it will not because you've not
[44:28] heard the
[44:30] word or you've not been corrected or
[44:33] you've not known what to
[44:35] do but let it be because you just want
[44:39] did not want to
[44:40] [Music]
[44:41] hear the scripture would
[44:44] say that if you see someone in the
[44:48] wrong and you you do not correct
[44:51] them then their blood will be required
[44:54] upon your head
[44:57] but if you see someone in the
[44:59] wrong you correct them and they don't
[45:02] take
[45:04] heed blood will be required upon their
[45:08] own so you see as as ministers as
[45:13] pastors our duty is to
[45:16] teach is to instruct is to preach your
[45:21] duty and our duty as
[45:24] Christians is to take what has been
[45:26] preached
[45:28] and we apply it upon our
[45:30] Liv praise the name of the Lord praise
[45:34] the name of the Lord if that when that
[45:36] day comes and we have to give
[45:40] accountability as preachers especially
[45:43] pastors because the prophet says Pastor
[45:46] is
[45:48] responsible for the people is given to
[45:51] Shepherd is responsible before God he
[45:54] will give an account
[45:57] so I want it to be that when that day
[46:01] comes I will say I did my
[46:04] best I did all I had to
[46:08] do then it will not be upon
[46:11] me if one or two or three did not take
[46:17] heat praise the
[46:19] Lord um I was just saying those comments
[46:21] as I was waiting for the
[46:25] questions still
[46:28] writing uh I think it was posted and
[46:31] everybody knew but
[46:33] [Music]
[46:35] some people like doing things in the
[46:37] last
[46:40] minute now before I approach the
[46:42] questions and
[46:44] answers some of which really
[46:50] doctrinal
[46:52] others
[46:53] um about daily living
[46:58] and others are just affecting the youth
[47:03] directly so we would take
[47:07] all um I preached I want to speak before
[47:10] I go into the questions I want to speak
[47:12] on something little that really I'm not
[47:14] preaching as such I'm just going to
[47:16] State the scriptures for you again I I
[47:18] did go through this uh when most of you
[47:21] students were at school
[47:31] and I want us to go through those
[47:32] scriptures
[47:37] again and then we shall now deal with
[47:39] the
[47:43] question uh 1 Corinthians chapter
[47:48] 6 and by the way I should also
[47:52] say we recently we've had great outp
[47:55] powering of the Holy Spirit here in in
[47:56] the
[48:00] church several Services several
[48:04] weeks I don't know about you as an
[48:08] individual but in my office I've been
[48:12] dealing with not one not
[48:15] two several
[48:17] people that God is
[48:20] visiting to take them to another
[48:22] level now when God visits you how do you
[48:25] know
[48:27] he's how do you
[48:30] know he shakes the
[48:34] foundations the whole building would be
[48:37] like as it's going to
[48:39] break but you would know that the Holy
[48:42] Spirit has come he's shaking the
[48:45] foundation so that they can be
[48:48] established so that the building can be
[48:52] established the stronger wind the
[48:55] stronger the wind blows and and and and
[48:57] sways the
[49:01] [Music]
[49:02] tree it is a clear
[49:04] sign that that tree is putting its roots
[49:10] deeper and so with all these
[49:12] people some of you are here others are
[49:15] not here see they come I don't
[49:18] know really God has been doing things in
[49:22] their it's not we are not taken by
[49:24] surprise
[49:26] I believe that when the Holy Spirit
[49:28] begins to do something work in
[49:31] you he will shake the
[49:34] foundations sometimes it is a life
[49:37] people have
[49:40] lived that has not been right and when
[49:43] the Holy Spirit
[49:44] comes he shakes that puts it on the on
[49:48] the ground he exposes
[49:51] it he cleans up cleans up individuals
[49:55] cleans up life
[49:57] and I want to say whenever the Holy
[49:58] Spirit comes like
[50:01] that and he is moving on your life to
[50:04] put something right you better do it
[50:08] when you have an
[50:11] opportunity you know one thing I I would
[50:13] even say I noticed it was asked in the
[50:17] questions I have I have never
[50:21] believed thank you brother that the Holy
[50:24] Spirit
[50:27] comes to
[50:30] ashame the Holy Spirit does not come to
[50:32] ashame
[50:34] any he's longer
[50:37] suffering he comes to correct
[50:40] you but where you refuse
[50:44] correction then be
[50:46] careful he can literally ashame you
[50:50] before but he is longsuffering he's
[50:53] patient with
[50:54] us wanting none to perish
[50:58] wanting everyone to be
[51:02] right praise the name of the
[51:06] Lord now in this church I um I preach
[51:12] Grace and there are many people even
[51:14] especially Pentecostals who preach
[51:17] Grace but you see the Pentecostals
[51:19] preach Grace and their Grace is disgrace
[51:27] meaning I mean you just go and live
[51:29] anyhow you want it
[51:31] doesn't
[51:35] God grace covers for
[51:37] you now the grace I
[51:39] preach is that it teaches Your Heart To
[51:42] Fear it brings you to know
[51:46] God it it picks you up from the mar
[51:51] clay and pulls you out of
[51:53] sin and makes you come before the Pres
[51:59] so
[52:00] undeserving but you are
[52:02] received by God and and then he begins
[52:05] working on
[52:06] you begins
[52:08] sanctifying begins cleansing and then
[52:11] fills you with the that's the grace I
[52:14] believe that's the grace I
[52:17] preach but I also
[52:19] understand that there are others who
[52:23] misunderstand cuz I mean I know of of
[52:26] people who usually want to preach
[52:30] works but so the service when I'm
[52:32] dealing with young people I like to to
[52:34] discuss the
[52:39] works and today I want to deal with the
[52:41] subject of
[52:45] fornication tell your neighbor
[52:52] fornication yes and I preached on this
[52:55] um in one of the serves flee
[52:59] fornication that's what I'm going to
[53:01] talk about and um we're just going to
[53:04] discuss it
[53:06] really not so much of a
[53:09] preaching so look at 1 Corinthians
[53:11] chapter
[53:12] 6
[53:14] 17 and what questions are we intending
[53:17] to
[53:20] answer we are intending to answer the
[53:23] questions is is it okay for believer to
[53:28] live in
[53:31] fornication and yet and continue to be a
[53:34] part of the
[53:36] [Music]
[53:37] church is it right for a Believer to
[53:40] continue professing
[53:44] Christianity saying God is working on
[53:48] me but they are continuing to leave that
[53:50] kind of
[53:53] Life Is it okay is is it right and if we
[53:58] we c a brother or a sister living that
[54:03] way deal with
[54:06] it okay let's look at 1 Corinthians 6
[54:11] ver7 um but he said but he that is
[54:15] joined unto the Lord is one
[54:18] Spirit we can begin from vers 16 I don't
[54:21] know
[54:22] why yeah what know you not that he which
[54:26] is joined unto anot is one body for two
[54:29] sayith he shall be one
[54:39] [Music]
[54:40] flesh what no you not that which that
[54:43] which is okay vers 17 did I read vers 16
[54:48] 16 okay vers 17 but he that is joined
[54:50] unto the Lord is one spirit
[54:56] free
[54:59] fornication every sin that a man doth is
[55:02] without the body but he that commit
[55:04] fornication sinth against his own
[55:16] [Music]
[55:21] body so I've heard many especially in
[55:24] the Pentecostals
[55:27] I know I say this because you will come
[55:29] across it if you haven't
[55:31] already they fornication is not a big
[55:35] deal because you don't sin against
[55:38] God you sin against your
[55:41] own and matter of fact they
[55:44] say that God is Not bothered by
[55:48] it as long as you are mature enough it's
[55:51] your body you decide what you do with it
[55:55] I don't know how many have heard of
[55:57] that and so this verse looks like it
[56:00] supports their
[56:02] idea because it says that he that
[56:04] commits fornication sin against own
[56:08] body but vers 19
[56:11] says what know you not that your body is
[56:15] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[56:21] [Music]
[56:24] you and ye are not your
[56:26] [Music]
[56:29] own tell your neighbor you are not your
[56:34] own for you are bought with a
[56:40] price therefore for glorify God in your
[56:46] body tell your neighbor glorify God in
[56:49] your
[56:51] body and in your
[56:53] spirit which are God is
[56:57] you see we are not our
[57:00] own from the moment Christ paid a
[57:05] price he bought us we are his
[57:09] property you are not your
[57:12] own if someone pays something that you
[57:17] own and you take it because it is now
[57:21] yours you use it the way you want it to
[57:24] use it because it is it is now
[57:28] yours it is your property it belongs to
[57:31] you whoever owned it before
[57:35] you no longer has ownership upon
[57:40] it why
[57:43] because they have purchased it from
[57:47] him they have paid the
[57:49] price now the one who owns it uses it
[57:53] the way he
[57:54] desires now when we come to
[57:57] Christ we we we understand that we are
[58:00] accepting that we are
[58:04] B we are not up for sale
[58:07] anymore we are bought
[58:10] already we no longer belong to the
[58:13] devil we no longer belong to the things
[58:16] that the devil made us
[58:19] do therefore the devil has no right to
[58:22] make us do anything or to make us obey
[58:25] him in doing
[58:32] anything he B us soul body
[58:37] Spirit he owns us that is Jesus Christ
[58:42] we are his
[58:43] property the devil has no right to bring
[58:46] sickness to
[58:47] us the devil has no right to make us do
[58:50] things in our spirit or in our body when
[58:56] you understand that you will know you
[58:59] can you as a purchase of his
[59:03] blood you have no right of your
[59:07] own to even use your body the way you
[59:12] want if your owner does not want it that
[59:18] way your soul body Spirit belongs to
[59:22] him the one that b you
[59:26] that paid the price for and therefore
[59:29] here he says don't you
[59:30] know that your body is the
[59:34] temple so he B your
[59:36] you and and you know your soul and then
[59:40] he uses the outer
[59:42] body as his Temple his dwelling
[59:45] [Music]
[59:46] place so now my body is the dwelling
[59:49] place of the Holy
[59:52] Spirit I am of God I am not my
[59:57] own I am B with a prize and because of
[1:00:01] that I should glorify God in my
[1:00:05] body I should glorify God in my
[1:00:09] spirit the things I do in my spirit I
[1:00:13] let me put it this way the things I
[1:00:15] allow access to my
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:20] spirit should be to the glory of
[1:00:24] God we five
[1:00:27] senses in our
[1:00:29] spirit we have
[1:00:31] conscience we have
[1:00:34] imagination we have
[1:00:36] memory we have all these other
[1:00:39] senses what are they used for they are
[1:00:43] used as
[1:00:45] doors you know we can protect
[1:00:48] it or we can allow all sorts of things
[1:00:50] to
[1:00:52] come you see but now when you open your
[1:00:56] sense your physical sense for
[1:01:00] example your ears you're
[1:01:03] hearing you open it to worldly music for
[1:01:07] example you begin listening to
[1:01:10] um who
[1:01:14] singers
[1:01:17] skin okay tell me tell
[1:01:23] meu you begin listen to
[1:01:26] I don't know what would
[1:01:28] tell West Life
[1:01:31] music I used to be imprisoned by that
[1:01:35] myself more than almost more than almost
[1:01:38] 25 years
[1:01:40] ago I don't even have the slightest
[1:01:43] appetite for
[1:01:46] it I died to
[1:01:48] it you understand what kind of music
[1:01:52] beyond music I Believers don't listen to
[1:01:56] by the way you should not listen to that
[1:01:58] kind
[1:02:02] of
[1:02:06] even listen that is not our
[1:02:12] portion we are bought with a
[1:02:16] price we should not
[1:02:18] open our
[1:02:21] ears to these things because it
[1:02:23] influences our spirit
[1:02:28] and therefore can end up daming
[1:02:32] us you see you open your ears to to to
[1:02:36] to those kind of you know music some of
[1:02:39] it some of that music sounds very
[1:02:44] innocent very innocent you feel like
[1:02:47] what is wrong with
[1:02:48] it it is just talking about day to-day
[1:02:53] life you know it's just talking and I'm
[1:02:55] feeling the way
[1:02:56] feeling it can massage me a
[1:02:59] bit and because you are you are having a
[1:03:04] heartbreak caused by the things that you
[1:03:06] did in the
[1:03:08] world and then now you want to massage
[1:03:11] your
[1:03:12] heart with a music which is sung by
[1:03:14] someone who does not even know the blood
[1:03:16] of
[1:03:20] Jesus that shows what is in
[1:03:23] you that shows what you're feeding
[1:03:26] these kind of things should not even be
[1:03:27] close to us as
[1:03:30] Believers let me tell you we should
[1:03:32] clean up the
[1:03:34] house until you do that you can never
[1:03:36] receive the Holy
[1:03:39] Spirit there is no way how can you your
[1:03:43] house has to be
[1:03:45] clean it has to be clean for him to come
[1:03:48] in he says here in verse 15 know ye not
[1:03:51] that ye are the bodies sorry ye that
[1:03:54] your bodies are the members of
[1:04:00] Christ shall I then take the members of
[1:04:02] Christ that make and make them the
[1:04:05] members of
[1:04:10] anot imagine you sharing a
[1:04:15] bed with someone who is not your
[1:04:18] wife with someone who is not your hus
[1:04:21] allowing someone to touch your
[1:04:23] body someone who is not not your wife
[1:04:27] someone who is not your husband you know
[1:04:29] I've told it here many times countless
[1:04:33] times about the um the sacred Virtues Of
[1:04:37] A
[1:04:39] Woman one of them is your sacred
[1:04:46] woman yes your body the way you behave
[1:04:50] around
[1:04:51] men the way you allow men to behave
[1:04:53] around you
[1:04:56] before even they touch you we talking
[1:04:59] about the way you present yourself to
[1:05:02] them how you
[1:05:04] dress is it appealing to them of the
[1:05:09] world do you know if you're a genuine
[1:05:12] believer you will never dress to to to
[1:05:16] to bring yourself in a position whereby
[1:05:18] you will cat the eyes of those in the
[1:05:20] world
[1:05:27] it is impossible I am telling you it is
[1:05:30] impossible you will dress and they will
[1:05:33] call you
[1:05:33] old you will dress and they will call
[1:05:36] you foolish you I'm talking to you
[1:05:39] sisters you will not dress to impress
[1:05:42] them but you see you know these things
[1:05:45] come in because you dress to impress the
[1:05:48] world the Bible says we are not of the
[1:05:53] world we are in the world but we are not
[1:05:57] of the
[1:05:57] world Listen there are things that
[1:06:01] people who are of the world
[1:06:04] do that we who are in the world but not
[1:06:07] of the world should never
[1:06:12] do even if they think or feel we should
[1:06:14] do
[1:06:16] them the world does not set trends for
[1:06:19] the
[1:06:21] Believers the Believers should set
[1:06:24] trends for the world
[1:06:27] that's why the says we are the salt
[1:06:30] of am I am I talking to someone
[1:06:33] this and so um here in the book of 1
[1:06:37] Corinthians
[1:06:39] 6 he explains it he says yes you sin
[1:06:43] against your
[1:06:44] body but your body is not even yours it
[1:06:48] doesn't belong to
[1:06:49] you someone paid a
[1:06:53] price your body is not yours glory of
[1:06:58] God you cannot take it and defile it
[1:07:03] in you cannot do that and still claim to
[1:07:06] be
[1:07:07] aie you cannot do
[1:07:09] that there would be something
[1:07:12] wrong with your
[1:07:15] experience and um I know we have very
[1:07:18] little
[1:07:20] time but um I would like us to to Tex
[1:07:23] things from the service tonight which
[1:07:25] will will can change our
[1:07:30] life okay look at Ephesians CH
[1:07:34] 5 be there for followers of God as dear
[1:07:36] children and walk in love as Christ also
[1:07:39] has loved us and has given himself for
[1:07:41] us as an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:07:44] for a sweet smelling saor but
[1:07:46] fornication and all uncleanness all
[1:07:48] covetousness let it not be once named
[1:07:50] among you as becometh Saints
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:24] have you heard
[1:08:26] you you people should be able to say
[1:08:28] Amen but
[1:08:31] fornication everybody say
[1:08:33] fornication all
[1:08:36] unlean
[1:08:38] cious let it not be
[1:08:46] once
[1:08:48] sa now not only that but also
[1:08:53] filth foolish
[1:08:57] talking by the way did you know that
[1:08:59] Believers don't do foolish
[1:09:02] talking and they say ah you mean no I
[1:09:05] was just I was just being I was just
[1:09:07] fooling with
[1:09:09] you we don't fool each
[1:09:16] other we don't do that we are
[1:09:20] Christians foolish
[1:09:23] talking or justing
[1:09:28] you know which are not
[1:09:31] convenient but rather giving of
[1:09:35] thanks for this you know that
[1:09:41] no no unlean
[1:09:45] person no cous
[1:09:48] man who is an
[1:09:52] idolator has any inheritance
[1:09:56] in the Kingdom of Christ and of
[1:09:59] God let no man deceive you with vain
[1:10:03] words for because of these things cometh
[1:10:06] the wrath of God upon the children of
[1:10:11] Disobedience so these are the things the
[1:10:13] world the worldly people are
[1:10:15] doing and their pastors are telling them
[1:10:18] just come the way you
[1:10:19] are and then when they come they begin
[1:10:22] to bring
[1:10:23] sermons which Mass them to continue the
[1:10:26] way they
[1:10:28] are for us we believe in the gospel that
[1:10:30] changes you
[1:10:34] completely you come when you are so
[1:10:37] sinful you come when you are so
[1:10:39] immoral no problem come the way you are
[1:10:43] but if you are sitting under the pure
[1:10:45] word rather it should change you it must
[1:10:50] change and the reason why it is not
[1:10:52] changing
[1:10:53] you is because you are not yielding
[1:10:56] yourself but if you really yield
[1:10:59] yourself how can you know that you begin
[1:11:01] to
[1:11:02] yield when you accept you are
[1:11:06] wrong when you accept you need a
[1:11:09] change when you really begin to be get
[1:11:13] concerned what is wrong with me
[1:11:16] something is wrong with me I must
[1:11:18] receive something from you know before
[1:11:20] you get that
[1:11:22] concern you cannot get a change
[1:11:25] you will hear good sermons
[1:11:27] go but you must get
[1:11:29] concerned and something is terribly
[1:11:32] wrong with
[1:11:33] you I need God to do something in
[1:11:37] me and that something is God filling you
[1:11:39] with the Holy
[1:11:41] Spirit you know when God fills you with
[1:11:44] the Holy
[1:11:44] Spirit you cannot remain with those
[1:11:47] immoral
[1:11:50] appetites we all had them we all had
[1:11:54] them had Appetit for worldly
[1:11:57] music some for
[1:12:00] alcohol others for smoking others for
[1:12:03] you know fornication imity and things
[1:12:06] but let me tell you brother you as a
[1:12:08] child of God when you come to God all
[1:12:12] those
[1:12:13] appetites you will submit yourself to
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:18] altar I'm not talking about the physical
[1:12:20] one I'm talking about the alar of the
[1:12:23] world and you allow God to mold you
[1:12:25] slowly by
[1:12:27] slow and one day when you receive an
[1:12:32] experience that one day by the
[1:12:34] way is until you yield
[1:12:38] yourself it's not something in the
[1:12:40] future it is something in the
[1:12:43] present heing yourself doesn't take you
[1:12:45] to you know wait for something to
[1:12:52] happen I remember when I came
[1:12:56] to the
[1:12:58] message you know God had kept
[1:13:00] me by his grace that I had never been
[1:13:04] into this kind of
[1:13:07] lifestyle of the world but but I was in
[1:13:10] the
[1:13:11] world and um you know you know was
[1:13:14] listening to all the music I remember
[1:13:17] there was a time I came this close to
[1:13:22] smoking you know I put I I put um
[1:13:26] a
[1:13:27] paper together like this because I would
[1:13:31] see people
[1:13:32] smoking and began enticing me so I put a
[1:13:36] paper together like
[1:13:37] this and
[1:13:39] put put fire on it and began pulling you
[1:13:43] know SM I choked almost to
[1:13:47] death that was the close as I came to
[1:13:52] smoke and I went to God told him I'm
[1:13:55] sorry I was young about maybe 8 n years
[1:14:01] but I remember his grace carried me
[1:14:04] through
[1:14:05] that I knew from that moment smokers can
[1:14:10] die because I almost died I choked
[1:14:13] almost
[1:14:16] death but
[1:14:18] anyways I S listen to the music of the
[1:14:22] world I still thought dating was okay
[1:14:27] had you know some
[1:14:29] girlfriends as much as we were not like
[1:14:31] doing
[1:14:32] anything you know I thought it is okay
[1:14:36] but when I came to this message I began
[1:14:38] to hear to hear people talk
[1:14:41] about how come that me I don't have what
[1:14:43] they talking about it made me to get
[1:14:47] bothered and I said no no no me I have
[1:14:50] no problem with
[1:14:52] girlfriend have sever of them I talk
[1:14:55] with this one they tell me it is wrong
[1:14:58] for you to do
[1:14:59] that said how come how even possible is
[1:15:04] it to live without a
[1:15:08] girlfriend how
[1:15:11] possible live
[1:15:14] without single
[1:15:19] single but as they continued
[1:15:22] preaching as they preaching these things
[1:15:25] kept on making
[1:15:27] sense but I realized I came to an
[1:15:31] understanding and I accepted I did not
[1:15:34] have what they were talking
[1:15:37] about you know preachers can talk about
[1:15:41] something but you have to realize
[1:15:43] whether you have it or
[1:15:45] not and if you realize you don't have it
[1:15:49] that's a good thing it's a
[1:15:52] beginning of God building something
[1:15:56] but the problem we have many people
[1:16:00] presume they have it you have the Holy
[1:16:05] Spirit yes I have the Holy Spirit but
[1:16:08] when they know their
[1:16:09] life is not an overcoming
[1:16:12] life you can't have the Holy
[1:16:15] Spirit and live in the life of
[1:16:19] fornication you can't have the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost and Liv in a life of smoking and
[1:16:24] drinking
[1:16:25] and all these
[1:16:27] appetites when the Holy Ghost comes he
[1:16:31] burns all those
[1:16:34] filthy he burs them not you but
[1:16:39] he so we want to have people who are
[1:16:42] going to Y themselves to the Holy
[1:16:46] Spirit and the problem with me I cannot
[1:16:50] stick many times with teaching something
[1:16:53] and then I end up preaching it
[1:16:59] but at the end of the day God will have
[1:17:01] his
[1:17:02] way we see here that he's talking about
[1:17:05] fornication and uncleanness
[1:17:10] andness and um and all these things he
[1:17:13] says don't be deceived those who are
[1:17:16] part of that will not inherit the
[1:17:17] kingdom of
[1:17:20] Christ so forget about the
[1:17:22] kingdom if you among the doers of
[1:17:26] now in first Thessalonians chapter
[1:17:29] 4 vers 3 he says for this is the will of
[1:17:38] God even your
[1:17:42] sanctification that you should
[1:17:45] abstain from
[1:17:49] fornication that every one of you should
[1:17:52] know how to possess his vess
[1:17:55] in sanctification and honor
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:28] hallelujah
[1:18:30] hallelujah the
[1:18:33] desire he says not in the last of
[1:18:36] conscience even as the Gentiles which
[1:18:38] know not God
[1:18:46] see cons I don't know whether that's the
[1:18:49] right pronunciation means sexual desire
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] so it means not don't don't don't
[1:18:57] possess your vessel in the last of
[1:19:00] sexual
[1:19:05] desire even as the
[1:19:08] Gentiles don't know
[1:19:11] godan the people who don't know
[1:19:13] God that's how they keep their
[1:19:16] bodies their bodies actually Byam used a
[1:19:20] word which we don't usually
[1:19:23] use he said
[1:19:25] Hollywood has you know presented a
[1:19:29] woman and made her a sex
[1:19:43] G that is
[1:19:45] correct if you look at what is happening
[1:19:48] in
[1:19:49] HW all these movies they're bringing out
[1:19:56] when there is a sin of a man and a
[1:19:59] woman they don't know each other they
[1:20:01] never meet each other the moment they
[1:20:04] meet they are going into
[1:20:06] immorality they're going into kissing
[1:20:09] they're
[1:20:12] goinging and so they present this image
[1:20:15] before the generation the
[1:20:19] generation that this is all about a
[1:20:22] woman this is how a woman is
[1:20:27] and so they also begin to become so
[1:20:29] lustful in their eyes and in their
[1:20:34] mind that's why even when a girl or
[1:20:36] woman is walking on on the road they
[1:20:38] will begin calling
[1:20:41] her Hollywood has undressed the
[1:20:44] woman and instead of making her dress
[1:20:47] well
[1:20:48] modestly they have made a dress
[1:20:52] what sir
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:57] sexy going back to what the brother
[1:21:00] say this is what reduced a woman
[1:21:05] to something of no
[1:21:08] value as something I mean like this
[1:21:11] woman would go with I don't care how
[1:21:13] many
[1:21:15] men and this man would come to her tell
[1:21:19] I'm not marrying
[1:21:21] you it's just friendship with benefits
[1:21:26] is it
[1:21:27] okay says no
[1:21:29] problem what a reduction of
[1:21:35] morality it shouldn't be that way it
[1:21:39] wasn't that way from the
[1:21:41] beginning the body of a woman is
[1:21:44] virtuous because it brings forth life on
[1:21:49] Earth the very first
[1:21:53] creature that was able to break those
[1:21:56] barriers of of a woman's
[1:22:00] v was the
[1:22:02] serent and God cast it so if you're
[1:22:06] going to be among if you're going to
[1:22:08] also take the anointing of a
[1:22:10] serpent you will realize you have a lot
[1:22:12] of
[1:22:14] CES and you know you do things things
[1:22:17] are
[1:22:18] working some of these people even lose
[1:22:19] their
[1:22:20] mind they can never stabilize they will
[1:22:23] be in marriages
[1:22:25] will you know they will never settle
[1:22:27] anywhere whatever they doing here cannot
[1:22:30] see the blessing of God many of them are
[1:22:33] Christians and the reason why these
[1:22:35] things are not working for
[1:22:37] them is because they have taken the
[1:22:40] mind the world the mind of Satan the
[1:22:45] mind of the SAT and they can never
[1:22:49] stabiliz they will become VAB
[1:22:54] do you know who a vagabond
[1:22:58] is
[1:23:01] VAB not having not having
[1:23:05] stability but you take take your take
[1:23:08] the Bible and look at the men who were
[1:23:12] right men who were right in their mind
[1:23:16] they were so
[1:23:17] stable they had stable
[1:23:20] homes these women they had stable
[1:23:22] homes they they had loving
[1:23:26] husbands they had loving wives and
[1:23:29] together they built their
[1:23:30] home to the glory of
[1:23:34] God but the world is giving us an
[1:23:39] option Hollywood is giving us an
[1:23:43] option but we should not accept that
[1:23:46] option we should not we don't have to by
[1:23:49] the
[1:23:50] way we don't have to because you see the
[1:23:54] Bible here is saying that we have a
[1:23:58] vessel that you have a
[1:24:00] vessel that vessel is your
[1:24:03] body brother Peter I'm happy to see you
[1:24:05] today that vessel is your
[1:24:08] body that vessel is my body but he says
[1:24:11] this he says every one of
[1:24:14] you should possess your
[1:24:18] vessel read that part I love the way he
[1:24:21] said in English in luganda you should
[1:24:23] possess your V
[1:24:30] you should know how to possess
[1:24:34] your possessing
[1:24:36] something is taking control over
[1:24:41] it are you hearing me he's controlling
[1:24:44] it is being the Lord over it he's being
[1:24:48] the power over it are you hearing me now
[1:24:51] the Bible says our bodies we as
[1:24:55] Believers we should possess
[1:24:57] them we should control them we should
[1:25:01] have power
[1:25:02] over we should not be like the
[1:25:06] Gentiles who do not know
[1:25:09] God because they don't know God they
[1:25:12] live like
[1:25:14] animals but we know God we should
[1:25:18] possess our
[1:25:20] vessels in h we should possess our
[1:25:24] vessel
[1:25:26] not in the last of sexual
[1:25:30] desire but we should possess it in
[1:25:34] sanctification and in
[1:25:39] honor you see that's how you
[1:25:43] know you are in
[1:25:45] Christ what does it mean
[1:25:49] also it
[1:25:51] means your body
[1:25:54] will
[1:25:55] never be filled with the
[1:25:59] spirit your body will always have
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:09] those your bodies will always be
[1:26:12] that why because is
[1:26:15] born by the
[1:26:21] L you understand we were born by the of
[1:26:24] the
[1:26:26] flesh you know this flesh was
[1:26:29] born that way cannot be Chang but what
[1:26:33] does God
[1:26:35] do what what does Fai in the word
[1:26:38] do it puts the power of the holy
[1:26:43] spirit inside your
[1:26:45] body to the extent that now that power
[1:26:49] of the Holy Spirit controls your
[1:26:53] body then you who are you you are the
[1:26:57] man living in your
[1:26:59] body you are the woman living in that
[1:27:03] body now you the man the woman who has
[1:27:06] the Holy
[1:27:08] Ghost will possess your
[1:27:11] body whereby the desires will be
[1:27:15] there but you will control
[1:27:18] it that's called The Power of
[1:27:21] selfcontrol
[1:27:24] every believer filled with the Holy
[1:27:25] Ghost should have
[1:27:29] it I'll be lying to you if I tell you
[1:27:31] that you'll be so safe that that desire
[1:27:33] will go it will not
[1:27:39] go but how can a
[1:27:41] man get married and live with one woman
[1:27:45] for 10 years 20 years 30 40 50
[1:27:48] Faithfully
[1:27:56] self
[1:27:58] control that's the only
[1:28:00] way that's the only way and you have to
[1:28:04] control
[1:28:06] it because if you don't it will control
[1:28:09] you I control my body by refusing to hug
[1:28:13] a
[1:28:18] woman I'm doing I'm having control over
[1:28:21] my
[1:28:22] body even when I feel like oh I'm so
[1:28:26] emotional and I know I'm
[1:28:28] spiritual I just want to hug
[1:28:31] this
[1:28:32] myself then I have to do
[1:28:35] that because I've been
[1:28:38] told by my Prophet that no matter how
[1:28:42] spiritual you
[1:28:44] are if you are a real living human
[1:28:49] being and you hug a woman
[1:28:54] bre touches
[1:28:57] your are you hearing
[1:29:01] me you can't remain the
[1:29:06] same yes you
[1:29:12] cannot therefore that's why
[1:29:15] Believers We Don't Hug
[1:29:18] sisters we don't if you were wondering
[1:29:22] why that's the reason why
[1:29:25] in all the believer's
[1:29:27] churches Brothers don't Huger
[1:29:31] sisters we are controlling
[1:29:34] ourselves are you saying when you Huger
[1:29:36] them you going to go into
[1:29:40] a no it doesn't mean that it means I am
[1:29:45] controlling
[1:29:46] myself I'm having my
[1:29:48] vessel in honor and in sanctification
[1:29:55] that's why when we meet
[1:29:57] sisters we you young men you cannot tell
[1:30:00] a sister come visit me in my
[1:30:04] house you don't do that we don't do that
[1:30:07] as
[1:30:08] believer we do it we we are presenting
[1:30:11] our vesses in sanctification and in
[1:30:15] honor we don't give the devil a
[1:30:19] chance but you a young lady you go visit
[1:30:22] that young man
[1:30:24] and then you say heed me no you did not
[1:30:28] he you were willing to be a
[1:30:32] participant because you knew what you
[1:30:34] were
[1:30:36] doing you did not present Your Vessel in
[1:30:41] h Your Vessel must be presented that way
[1:30:44] in
[1:30:46] h and in
[1:30:51] sanctification I've heard of that I can
[1:30:53] even sh
[1:30:58] bed you
[1:31:01] lying it's not
[1:31:03] true no Pastor you just don't know me
[1:31:06] I'm
[1:31:07] Different I am sorry you were born I was
[1:31:10] born we are all the
[1:31:13] same and you've heard some people
[1:31:16] say because they were heart
[1:31:18] broken men are
[1:31:22] dogs oh women are
[1:31:26] those are cast words you should
[1:31:29] never say those words all men and all
[1:31:32] women are the
[1:31:34] same the only difference is a man or a
[1:31:37] woman who has the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] Inside there is no one who is different
[1:31:46] or
[1:31:48] better no the only difference is the
[1:31:51] Holy
[1:31:51] Ghost receive the Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] and everything will be
[1:31:58] different and
[1:32:02] you let me first read this first
[1:32:05] Corinthians chap
[1:32:07] 10 now these things were our examples
[1:32:15] that and drink and Rose up to play
[1:32:18] nether let us commit fornication as some
[1:32:20] of them committed and fail in one day
[1:32:22] 300 Excuse Me 3 and 20,000 neither let
[1:32:26] us tempt Christ as some of them also
[1:32:28] tempted and were also destroyed of
[1:32:30] serpents
[1:32:54] track what what are you reading I'm
[1:32:57] reading First Corinthians 10:1 no read 6
[1:33:00] and N oh sorry
[1:33:43] so here is talking about
[1:33:45] whatam you remember it I talked
[1:33:49] about how God this bam wanted to cast
[1:33:54] these children of
[1:33:56] Israel but um you know he could not cast
[1:34:00] them because they were right with
[1:34:03] God but the only way he was able to cast
[1:34:08] them is when he was able to get them
[1:34:11] into the parties of the
[1:34:14] world and that was a conduit for them to
[1:34:20] receive the spirit of fornication
[1:34:24] that's why
[1:34:25] Believers we should never be in those
[1:34:29] parties of
[1:34:31] nonbelievers I think you heard what I
[1:34:33] said parties of
[1:34:36] nonbeliever they could even be
[1:34:40] relatives even if your parents have
[1:34:42] allowed you to
[1:34:43] go you must have
[1:34:45] limitations you know that's why for us
[1:34:47] our parties we end Before Dawn
[1:34:50] before because we we are not going to
[1:34:53] dance that
[1:34:55] night we don't do those kind of
[1:34:58] things our night parties are
[1:35:02] overnight yes we come here and pray and
[1:35:05] dance and sing and pray and then go back
[1:35:08] home that's what we have we do it you
[1:35:11] cannot go in a night
[1:35:13] party or in a house
[1:35:15] party or in a beer party with friends or
[1:35:19] relatives or
[1:35:20] whatever that should be a no no no for
[1:35:23] you
[1:35:24] that's how you presenting your you're
[1:35:26] possessing Your Vessel with
[1:35:29] horon you are we are saying know to mix
[1:35:35] up but when they invite you you also go
[1:35:38] after all they my friend I'm just going
[1:35:41] to just
[1:35:42] enjoy I will not drink alcohol but I
[1:35:46] will just drink the you know one one
[1:35:49] one eventually after a while you learn
[1:35:54] how to take
[1:35:55] beer because they take you just take one
[1:35:58] for a social
[1:36:00] drink and you know you remember al
[1:36:02] pastor was preaching and he said it's
[1:36:03] not a sin to take
[1:36:05] Al so after all it is not a sinful
[1:36:09] thing my dear you are on your way to
[1:36:13] Hell by that kind of Lifestyle you
[1:36:16] should possess your
[1:36:18] vessel in hon it is not a sin for me to
[1:36:21] hug a sister
[1:36:23] but by not doing it I'm possessing my
[1:36:25] vessel with
[1:36:29] horon and then you know they went and
[1:36:33] they began
[1:36:34] dancing
[1:36:36] their with a worldly
[1:36:39] unbelievers and soon enough night
[1:36:44] came and all these boys and girls forgot
[1:36:48] they were
[1:36:49] believers they enjoyed it they enjoyed
[1:36:52] it knew it they were doing immorality
[1:36:56] with
[1:36:58] them and God was so
[1:37:00] angry you see by the way the sin of
[1:37:03] immortal living or fornication Grieves
[1:37:06] God so
[1:37:11] much it Grieves him so much to the
[1:37:15] extent is the only thing that balam was
[1:37:18] able to do that made God to kill them
[1:37:21] physically and spiritually
[1:37:28] and it's the only thing
[1:37:30] today that would make us Chas a brother
[1:37:33] or a sister out of the
[1:37:39] fellowship tell you brother sister if
[1:37:42] this is your life we cannot part with
[1:37:46] you your life is
[1:37:50] unclean now is that even scripture
[1:37:54] First Corinthians
[1:37:58] 5 uh
[1:38:02] 9 I wrote unto you an EP not to company
[1:38:05] with
[1:38:09] fornicators uhuh we should even have
[1:38:12] fellowship with
[1:38:14] them which company he says to
[1:38:18] associat you know with sexually immoral
[1:38:21] people
[1:38:23] to company with them now he did not say
[1:38:27] those who were
[1:38:30] fornicators he say those who are
[1:38:34] fornicators so if you have been a
[1:38:36] fornicator and you repent and put your
[1:38:39] life
[1:38:41] right repentance is a change of
[1:38:46] mind repentance is a decision to turn
[1:38:48] away from those
[1:38:51] things and stop doing it
[1:38:54] now people confuse repentance with
[1:38:58] confession repentance is
[1:39:03] change confession is saying what you
[1:39:07] did amen someone if he a fornicator and
[1:39:10] he
[1:39:11] repents and he changes his mind he turns
[1:39:15] his back on those things that
[1:39:17] lifestyle that is a brother he can
[1:39:20] fellowship with us but a brother
[1:39:24] who claims to be one of us and is
[1:39:27] continuing to live that
[1:39:32] lifestyle the Bible says we should not
[1:39:34] accompany ourself we should not
[1:39:36] associate ourself with such a
[1:39:40] person he says yet not all together with
[1:39:43] the fornicators of this
[1:39:47] world because there many everybody ass
[1:39:50] out there
[1:39:53] life but he's saying he's not talking
[1:39:55] about
[1:39:57] those all the C of the
[1:39:59] world all the
[1:40:02] extortion of the world the
[1:40:06] idolators for then we must also go out
[1:40:08] of the world in that
[1:40:11] case but he say now I have written unto
[1:40:14] you not to keep
[1:40:18] Company If any
[1:40:20] man that is called a brother
[1:40:24] or a sister for that matter be a
[1:40:28] fornicator
[1:40:31] orious
[1:40:33] anid or a
[1:40:35] raer or a
[1:40:36] drun or an
[1:40:38] extortioner someone who takes people
[1:40:40] money from
[1:40:42] people with SE anyone not even to eat
[1:40:46] with
[1:40:48] them for what have I to do to judge them
[1:40:53] that are
[1:40:58] without I only judge those who are
[1:41:03] within so you
[1:41:06] see this
[1:41:08] message is a message of
[1:41:11] Grace bring grace to you your life
[1:41:15] changes you live this kind of
[1:41:17] Lifestyle but if you having received the
[1:41:21] message continually leave wrong
[1:41:24] life then that's when you hear
[1:41:30] excommunication believe in
[1:41:33] excommunication do we say Amen to
[1:41:36] that we believe in it if someone is not
[1:41:40] accepting to
[1:41:42] change and their life is not bringing
[1:41:45] fruits and they continually living like
[1:41:48] this then we shouldn't even accomp
[1:41:54] the script is very clear
[1:41:56] about now how can we avoid
[1:42:00] [Music]
[1:42:03] fornication two
[1:42:04] ways number one which is the
[1:42:09] absolute is walking in the
[1:42:13] spirit you can't walk in the spirit
[1:42:15] until re you receive the Holy
[1:42:18] Spirit but the Bible says if you work in
[1:42:20] the
[1:42:21] spirit you will fulfill the last of the
[1:42:26] flesh now the works of the flesh are
[1:42:29] manifest
[1:42:31] for
[1:42:33] lasv
[1:42:35] witchcraft ulations wrath Strife
[1:42:41] seditions envs MDS drunkenness
[1:42:46] reings and those kind of things that
[1:42:50] they do such
[1:42:51] things not inherit
[1:42:54] the and the Bible has told us that but
[1:42:57] if you walk in the
[1:43:01] spirit the last of the flesh will be
[1:43:05] there but if we walk in the
[1:43:08] spirit we shall not fulfill
[1:43:13] it hallelujah
[1:43:16] hallelujah now
[1:43:19] lastly First Corinthians 7 it says
[1:43:22] concerning the things where of ye wrote
[1:43:24] unto me it is good for a man not to
[1:43:26] touch a woman neither to avoid
[1:43:28] fornication nevertheless to avoid
[1:43:30] fornication let every man have his own
[1:43:32] wife and let every woman have her own
[1:43:50] husband so you see even if you have
[1:43:52] received the Holy
[1:43:54] Spirit and you are walking in the
[1:43:57] spirit unless you are
[1:43:59] un the Bible says to avoid
[1:44:02] fornication you should get
[1:44:05] married but if you get
[1:44:08] married before you begin walking in the
[1:44:11] spirit even
[1:44:13] then that cannot be a
[1:44:17] solution what does it mean before anyone
[1:44:20] gets
[1:44:22] married you must receive the Holy
[1:44:25] Spirit you must begin working in the
[1:44:29] spirit you must
[1:44:31] overcome the body the flesh before you
[1:44:34] even get
[1:44:36] mared am I am I communicating to
[1:44:40] someone hallelujah
[1:44:42] hallelujah so with those words we have a
[1:44:44] few questions here we to go through
[1:44:47] quickly and someone um sent me a
[1:44:50] question I think from the youth meetings
[1:44:55] group probably they online following it
[1:44:57] up say uh God bless you Pastor this
[1:45:00] Brother David I have a question to ask
[1:45:02] are you supposed to make a public
[1:45:03] confession of an addiction you
[1:45:07] have you have
[1:45:17] overcome for example pornography
[1:45:24] uh
[1:45:26] betting most commonly
[1:45:29] those are you supposed to make a public
[1:45:33] confession now in answer to this
[1:45:37] question first of all we need to remove
[1:45:39] in our
[1:45:42] mind that it is our works that save
[1:45:45] us it is his grace that saves us is his
[1:45:49] work that saves
[1:45:51] us so then this also goes to before you
[1:45:55] even put it right before you even
[1:45:57] overcome
[1:46:00] it must it be brought to the
[1:46:03] church must it be brought to the
[1:46:08] church that oh someone is doing this you
[1:46:11] have to go and confess
[1:46:14] it we' we've had churches that do
[1:46:18] that that if you called doing anything
[1:46:21] like these things
[1:46:24] you come and confess
[1:46:26] it but you see they confess it and
[1:46:29] remain the
[1:46:30] same they confess it and it's not
[1:46:34] confession that is that magically does
[1:46:38] it it is you finding the power that
[1:46:42] changes you being filled with the Holy
[1:46:45] Ghost that changes
[1:46:48] you now whatever is said or spoken in
[1:46:51] the church
[1:46:54] must be to edify the
[1:46:59] church Philippians 48 says whatsoever
[1:47:02] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:47:04] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:47:07] whatever things are
[1:47:09] pure whatever things are lovely whatever
[1:47:12] things are of good
[1:47:14] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:47:18] be any
[1:47:19] praise then think on these
[1:47:21] things Romans
[1:47:23] 19 let us follow after the things which
[1:47:26] make for
[1:47:29] peace and things where with one may
[1:47:32] edify
[1:47:35] another are you are you are you hearing
[1:47:37] me all right 1 Corinthians
[1:47:40] 102 all things are lawful to
[1:47:44] me for
[1:47:46] me yes 1023
[1:47:52] things are not
[1:47:56] experienced so the question is is it
[1:47:59] okay I think it's not
[1:48:01] wrong if you have a testimony and you
[1:48:04] want to give
[1:48:05] it but if it is not going to it's not
[1:48:08] not every testimony is necessary for you
[1:48:10] to speak in the
[1:48:13] church all things are lawful for
[1:48:16] me all things they defy
[1:48:19] not it's like you who was a murderer
[1:48:23] and then you you come to give a
[1:48:27] testimony imagine me I'm your person I'm
[1:48:30] talking my
[1:48:32] testimony I even have a testimony I used
[1:48:35] to M People I Ked five but God by his
[1:48:42] gra if I ever call one of you for
[1:48:44] counseling you will never
[1:48:46] come because you
[1:48:50] what so my testimony never defied
[1:48:54] you you understand so everything is okay
[1:48:57] it is okay to give the testimony
[1:49:01] un but it if it doesn't
[1:49:04] edify it is not necessary for you to in
[1:49:07] the
[1:49:09] church um even so as much as ye as zous
[1:49:12] of spiritual gift sick that ye may excel
[1:49:14] to the edifying of the church that is 1
[1:49:17] Corinthians 14:12 it's all about
[1:49:19] edifying the
[1:49:21] church even CH 14: 26 where he talks
[1:49:24] about interpreting of the
[1:49:26] tongues or or speaking of tongues or
[1:49:29] having a revelation or
[1:49:31] adop you know when it is given in the
[1:49:34] church it should be to edify the
[1:49:37] church whatever we speak in the church
[1:49:41] must be for one purpose to edify the
[1:49:44] church amen all right so I think I've
[1:49:47] answered that one now question number
[1:49:49] two is it also this the same person he
[1:49:52] says also is it possible to be born
[1:49:53] again
[1:49:56] Christian of course filled with the Holy
[1:49:58] Spirit but yet you're fighting an
[1:50:03] addiction if yes and you are a minister
[1:50:05] must you first step down from your
[1:50:07] ministry or continue until you have
[1:50:09] fully overcome
[1:50:23] now I believe you cannot be
[1:50:26] addicted to
[1:50:28] smoking alcohol to
[1:50:32] fornication drugs
[1:50:35] imal and you have the Holy Spirit at the
[1:50:37] same
[1:50:39] time it is impossible you cannot have an
[1:50:44] addiction and have the Holy
[1:50:48] Spirit it is
[1:50:51] impossible and no one should should
[1:50:53] minister or preach the gospel until they
[1:50:57] have been filled with the Holy
[1:51:00] Spirit the evidence of the holy spirit
[1:51:03] is by believing Every
[1:51:05] Word by saying Amen to the
[1:51:08] word but if you are living that life you
[1:51:12] are not saying Amen to the word you're
[1:51:14] saying Amen to those
[1:51:18] things so you're still in
[1:51:21] agreement with those e fulfilling those
[1:51:25] evil I read for you a quote here from
[1:51:29] the message
[1:51:30] persever and one day this Runway Prophet
[1:51:33] back on the back side of the
[1:51:37] desert he really come on them sacred
[1:51:41] Sons to where every Minister ought to
[1:51:45] come no matter how many doctor's degree
[1:51:47] he's
[1:51:49] got a professor or College of college
[1:51:53] or whatever he may be he has no business
[1:51:57] behind the
[1:51:59] pulpit until
[1:52:02] first his C on them sacred Sons between
[1:52:05] him and God
[1:52:09] alone but he has got an experience with
[1:52:12] God that no scientist in the world could
[1:52:15] ever hmer away from
[1:52:18] him they can take that word and cut it
[1:52:21] anywhere they want to
[1:52:25] the devil uses the word and he proved it
[1:52:27] he uses the word to cut his own program
[1:52:31] out but when a man has once been back
[1:52:35] there on them sacred
[1:52:39] Sons meaning like having an
[1:52:42] experence where nothing but you and God
[1:52:45] Alone can
[1:52:47] stand nothing can take that out of
[1:52:50] you Jesus wouldn't even let the
[1:52:53] disciples
[1:52:57] preach until they went to
[1:53:00] Jerusalem and they received the Holy
[1:53:03] Ghost before they went
[1:53:06] preaching so Brother David I want to
[1:53:09] tell
[1:53:11] you that the first thing that this
[1:53:13] brother needs to
[1:53:15] do is to receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:53:18] he does not have if he's still fighting
[1:53:21] and you know with this of
[1:53:24] add when the Holy Spirit comes in your
[1:53:27] life those dark addictions
[1:53:31] break is a power to help you live above
[1:53:37] it it's a power to propel
[1:53:41] you the flesh will not be saved as I
[1:53:44] told you but there will be a power in
[1:53:48] you that will help you to live above
[1:53:51] those addic
[1:53:53] and until you have an experience with
[1:53:56] God you should never
[1:53:59] preach until you have received the Holy
[1:54:02] Spirit you should not even
[1:54:05] s you should not even be behind the
[1:54:08] pulpit until you have been filled with
[1:54:11] the Holy
[1:54:13] Spirit why because if you
[1:54:17] haven't then you not being like the
[1:54:19] disciples because Jesus Christ told the
[1:54:21] disciples to First go in the
[1:54:25] upper and and wait upon receiving the
[1:54:27] spirit of
[1:54:29] God it was only after then that he told
[1:54:31] them now you can go and be
[1:54:35] Witnesses ah there's much I can talk
[1:54:38] about someone uh wrote this
[1:54:41] question I think a sister did not write
[1:54:44] the name here he said explain John
[1:54:49] 1:1 in the beginning was the word and
[1:54:51] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:54:56] God so sister I can only tell you to go
[1:54:58] to vers
[1:55:02] 14 quickly
[1:55:06] now sister who ask this is not here so
[1:55:08] you
[1:55:11] can and the Word was made flesh and
[1:55:13] dwelt Among Us and be and we beheld his
[1:55:16] glory the only Glory the glory as of the
[1:55:18] only begotten of the father full of
[1:55:20] grace and truth
[1:55:32] so meaning God is the
[1:55:35] word the word is
[1:55:37] God and the Bible
[1:55:39] says that God DW among
[1:55:44] us and we beheld his glory he put on
[1:55:48] flesh he was made flesh and DW Among Us
[1:55:53] in other words Jesus was God in
[1:55:58] flesh but before
[1:56:05] that let be so God and His word are the
[1:56:09] same
[1:56:10] thing just like you and your words are
[1:56:12] the same thing that's why our Prophet
[1:56:14] told us man is as good as his word
[1:56:51] people should be better than
[1:56:54] Japan when you say when you tell someone
[1:56:57] I'll be
[1:56:59] there be
[1:57:01] there let your word tell of your
[1:57:06] character we should be men and women of
[1:57:09] character let it not be that when you
[1:57:11] speak
[1:57:13] something someone will have to to say
[1:57:15] let us wait and
[1:57:17] see whether he will
[1:57:19] fulfill but I want it to be
[1:57:22] that when I say something I will do
[1:57:26] it praise the name of the Lord sometimes
[1:57:29] it also Catches Us the
[1:57:33] preachers in
[1:57:36] minutes in minutes in 10 minutes in 20
[1:57:41] and you take two
[1:57:43] hours said you not as good as
[1:57:47] your I believe a man is as good as his
[1:57:52] praise the name of the Lord that's why
[1:57:54] I've always
[1:57:56] tried in the church here when I tell you
[1:57:58] this the
[1:57:59] last even if I feel I had more to
[1:58:04] say because I have to H my
[1:58:06] word God is the same as his
[1:58:10] word and we found out that the word is
[1:58:14] God and that word was made flesh when
[1:58:17] Jesus was born so God was in Jesus
[1:58:24] so Jesus is God in
[1:58:27] flesh all right I was then asked another
[1:58:29] question
[1:58:31] here is the message totally based on
[1:58:33] brother
[1:58:37] Bram is the message totally based on
[1:58:41] brother
[1:58:42] bham totally best
[1:58:48] bam the answer to that question is no
[1:58:53] it is not even based on
[1:58:56] brother the message is based on
[1:59:00] Christ so where does brother bham
[1:59:03] come brother bham like all God's
[1:59:07] servants she was a
[1:59:10] messenger to our
[1:59:12] generation who pointed
[1:59:15] us to the word
[1:59:18] Christ in
[1:59:20] fulfillment of a prophecy which was
[1:59:24] given before and I'm going to take five
[1:59:29] minutes I'll be as good as my
[1:59:32] word and show you some three four
[1:59:36] scriptures on this issue quickly open to
[1:59:39] Malachi
[1:59:41] 4 verse
[1:59:43] 5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:59:45] before the coming of the great and wful

[2:07:28] acceptable year of the
[2:07:32] Lord vers that part that
[2:07:35] portion it is the same as verse
[2:07:38] one he opened the eyes of the blind he
[2:07:42] opened the prison doors of those who
[2:07:43] were in prison he healed the sick ra a
[2:07:46] dead by doing that he was declaring the
[2:07:49] acceptable year of the Lord
[2:07:52] and
[2:07:53] that is
[2:07:56] prophesying about the first coming of
[2:07:58] the
[2:07:59] Messiah when Jesus came in Luke 4 he
[2:08:05] read the same
[2:08:07] verse and he finished
[2:08:11] here where you see this coma he never
[2:08:15] continued and then he said he closed the
[2:08:18] book and everybody looked at him he said
[2:08:22] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[2:08:25] your
[2:08:27] ear what does it mean what he had read
[2:08:30] for
[2:08:31] them was
[2:08:33] fulfilled but he never finished the
[2:08:36] second
[2:08:37] verse my God that second
[2:08:42] verse was speaking about the day of
[2:08:46] Vengeance it was still the coming of the
[2:08:50] Messiah day of
[2:08:52] judgment the second
[2:08:54] coming Jesus knew his first coming was
[2:08:59] only the great day to save the Sinners
[2:09:03] but the second coming will be the
[2:09:05] Dreadful
[2:09:07] day to judge the living and the dead how
[2:09:11] many have understood that now that part
[2:09:16] is what also Malachi is prophesying
[2:09:18] about let us go back to Malachi so then
[2:09:21] Mal says behold I will send you Elijah
[2:09:26] the
[2:09:27] prophet before the coming of the
[2:09:32] Great and the Dreadful day of the
[2:09:38] Lord okay where is the where where is
[2:09:41] the great day of the
[2:09:43] Lord is the first coming of
[2:09:46] Jesus so it is him this one is the first
[2:09:49] coming of Jesus
[2:09:52] uhhuh now this is the second coming of
[2:09:56] Jesus but before the great
[2:10:00] day and before the Dreadful day I will
[2:10:04] send
[2:10:05] you
[2:10:08] elij you have understood
[2:10:13] that okay look closely here you going to
[2:10:17] be
[2:10:19] amazed now
[2:10:22] H in the Book of Luke let us read there
[2:10:25] chapter 1:
[2:10:27] 13 but the angel said unto
[2:10:30] him okay I'm not going to read Because
[2:10:32] of time but you write Luke 1: 13 to
[2:10:39] 17 if you can't write you'll go back and
[2:10:41] listen and then write
[2:10:45] those now here he's talking about the
[2:10:48] birth of John the Baptist
[2:10:51] and there is one thing
[2:10:54] significant that is said here on verse
[2:10:56] 17 meaning
[2:10:58] John this
[2:11:00] one John he will go before
[2:11:05] Christ in the power and in the spirit of
[2:11:11] Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[2:11:16] fathers to the
[2:11:19] children so John is
[2:11:23] was to come before the
[2:11:27] Messiah before the great
[2:11:29] day to turn the hearts of the
[2:11:32] fathers to the children that's the only
[2:11:35] thing John
[2:11:37] did but Malachi says how many
[2:11:40] things fathers to children children to
[2:11:45] fathers but John his work was only the
[2:11:49] hearts of fathers
[2:11:52] to Children this is not talking about
[2:11:54] father mother
[2:11:57] no spiritual
[2:12:00] significance it is talking about the
[2:12:03] fathers of the
[2:12:05] law they said
[2:12:08] s those ones who were having those long
[2:12:11] beard the fathers of the law the ones
[2:12:14] who told Jesus why are you healing this
[2:12:19] woman John came to turn these people's
[2:12:24] heart from the
[2:12:26] law to Christ
[2:12:28] Grace by doing what by preaching
[2:12:32] repentance repent the kingdom of God is
[2:12:36] by accepting that Gospel of
[2:12:39] repentance they accepted
[2:12:42] Christ he said the one who is coming I'm
[2:12:46] not even worthy to
[2:12:49] Lon is greater than I
[2:12:52] and said now after baptizing him said I
[2:12:55] must
[2:12:56] reduce so that he can
[2:12:58] increase so John turned the
[2:13:02] Jews their hearts their FA from the law
[2:13:06] to
[2:13:07] Grace that was the ministry of John and
[2:13:12] it ended
[2:13:14] there and then Christ
[2:13:17] came if John did not come
[2:13:21] according to Mali
[2:13:23] 4 6 God would C the whole
[2:13:27] world there had to be someone to
[2:13:30] introduce the
[2:13:32] Messiah and when he came then the
[2:13:34] Messiah came he said behold the Son of
[2:13:38] God that takes away the of the world he
[2:13:41] introduced the
[2:13:42] Messiah and the Messiah now came and he
[2:13:46] did his ministry for three and a half
[2:13:48] years and then he went to heaven
[2:13:51] he died and rose again and then he went
[2:13:53] to heaven and then for almost 2,000
[2:13:58] years the world has been having a lot of
[2:14:02] things many religions
[2:14:04] churches people believed on this
[2:14:08] Mah but
[2:14:10] eventually they became so
[2:14:14] denominated so messed
[2:14:16] up that they forgot the
[2:14:19] original now
[2:14:21] in the same
[2:14:22] SC he says behold I send you the prophet
[2:14:26] who will do what who will come
[2:14:28] before the Dreadful
[2:14:32] day this elah will come before the Dre
[2:14:35] Day do what to turn the hearts of the
[2:14:41] children who are the children now who
[2:14:45] are the children now we are the
[2:14:48] children we have received the spirit of
[2:14:50] of God now we
[2:14:53] cry beloved now are we the sons of
[2:14:57] God so we are not children of
[2:14:59] Israel children of
[2:15:01] God you
[2:15:05] understand right there in in Luke he was
[2:15:08] when he was talking about
[2:15:10] John he said the children of
[2:15:14] Israel to the Lord
[2:15:17] God but this one this Elijah is going
[2:15:21] turn the hearts of the
[2:15:23] children God to who to their fathers who
[2:15:28] are our fathers the apostles and the
[2:15:32] prophets so the work of this
[2:15:35] Elijah is to turn the hearts of their
[2:15:39] children back again to their
[2:15:43] fathers John whenever you read about
[2:15:46] this John it is talking about prepare
[2:15:50] prepare something new was coming mesiah
[2:15:53] was going to be born but whenever you
[2:15:55] talk about this oneing about restore
[2:15:59] restore bringing back that which was
[2:16:03] lost back again so this one doesn't
[2:16:06] bring new things but the other one
[2:16:09] introduced all new
[2:16:11] things baptism water repentance you know
[2:16:16] new things the mesiah had come
[2:16:19] everything was new but this one
[2:16:21] no new
[2:16:22] thing now read
[2:16:25] one and then it will
[2:16:27] open for every one of you okay look at
[2:16:33] Matthew when Jesus himself is talking
[2:16:35] about
[2:16:38] Mali chter 17 verse
[2:16:41] 10 and his disciples asked him
[2:16:45] saying why then does the scribes say
[2:16:48] that Elias must first come
[2:16:55] why I wish I had time to explain the
[2:16:57] vers
[2:16:59] before but maybe what I can say I will
[2:17:02] say this you know this is the Mount
[2:17:07] Transfiguration when Jesus had gone with
[2:17:10] some disciples on the
[2:17:13] mountain
[2:17:15] brother then what happened there is um
[2:17:19] um uh I don't want you to miss this part
[2:17:23] don't miss this part I wanted to be part
[2:17:25] of us okay where was
[2:17:28] I when he had gone on the
[2:17:31] mountain remember what happened then
[2:17:35] Moses and Elijah
[2:17:37] appear and then the disciples saw
[2:17:41] Moses they saw El do you know what that
[2:17:44] represents two things Moses was you know
[2:17:49] Moses died Moses died you know you know
[2:17:52] that Moses was representing those who
[2:17:54] died in
[2:17:57] Christ and elah never died he was
[2:18:00] representing those who are alive
[2:18:02] in you know first
[2:18:04] Thessalonians chter 4 ver 11 he
[2:18:09] says when the trumpet of
[2:18:13] God then the dead in
[2:18:15] Christ shall rise those who are alive
[2:18:19] and remain
[2:18:21] shall be CAU
[2:18:24] up and they shall meet the Lord in the
[2:18:28] air so now the
[2:18:30] disciples they saw
[2:18:32] Moses he never he died they saw Elijah
[2:18:36] he never di the dead in Christ and those
[2:18:40] who are alive shall be caught up and
[2:18:44] they will meet the Lord so they saw
[2:18:46] Moses El and Jesus he had changed and in
[2:18:50] a
[2:18:52] clow so they you receive the Revelation
[2:18:55] this is the
[2:18:57] Messiah they never knew until that time
[2:19:00] they never knew he the Messiah the man
[2:19:03] is the Messiah quickly they remember the
[2:19:06] prophets of
[2:19:07] M do you know why because when John the
[2:19:10] Baptist
[2:19:11] came they had missed
[2:19:14] him they had not known that this man was
[2:19:17] the
[2:19:19] Elijah they had not know so when he came
[2:19:23] for them they they had seen this
[2:19:25] Jesus and they were
[2:19:29] here so these are the people
[2:19:32] here the other is already
[2:19:34] fulf and they never knew so they are now
[2:19:38] seeing this one and they realizing is
[2:19:39] the Messiah so they looked at him so
[2:19:43] tell us in other words if you are the
[2:19:46] Messiah why did the writers say
[2:19:51] elah will
[2:19:52] come us we didn't see
[2:19:56] Elijah but Elijah had
[2:19:59] already they had missed
[2:20:01] him do you want to know the answer of
[2:20:04] Jesus is going to explode your
[2:20:07] mind look at it Jesus answered and said
[2:20:11] unto them
[2:20:14] Elias
[2:20:15] truly shall first come
[2:20:23] oh my God you're not getting
[2:20:24] it did you get it listen Jesus
[2:20:30] now hey this you saying
[2:20:33] elij of course
[2:20:40] Elijah is it future or
[2:20:45] P you got it it is a future t
[2:20:50] Elijah truly shall first
[2:20:56] come have not but follow me El truly
[2:20:59] first come Jesus is now not talking
[2:21:02] about his
[2:21:04] coming he's talking about he's
[2:21:08] coming and he saying before I
[2:21:11] come that Elijah shall first come and
[2:21:16] this one who shall first
[2:21:17] come he says what will he do restore all
[2:21:25] things how many got it this Elijah when
[2:21:30] he comes he will restore all
[2:21:33] things all doctrines all teachings
[2:21:36] everything the apost told he will
[2:21:39] restore he will bring nothing new he
[2:21:42] will restore all things but when he said
[2:21:45] that the disciples are
[2:21:48] still don't understand what he's saying
[2:21:51] because he has already he's here so what
[2:21:54] is he
[2:21:56] meaning and then he Chang the
[2:21:59] gear but I love it in Ethiopia when we
[2:22:03] say but that's there it sounds so real
[2:22:07] he
[2:22:08] says
[2:22:11] says I sayto you Oh Brother Sam you are
[2:22:16] leaving this Revelation where will you
[2:22:18] find he says but I say unto you listen
[2:22:21] listen listen I say unto you that
[2:22:25] Elias is what come
[2:22:31] already
[2:22:33] hallelujah how many got it but I say he
[2:22:37] shall first come and restore all things
[2:22:40] but I say he has already
[2:22:43] come and you never knew him and you have
[2:22:47] done to him everything like you did to
[2:22:48] all
[2:22:51] that's when they
[2:22:54] said the Bible says that's when the
[2:22:56] disciples
[2:22:57] understood that he was speaking
[2:23:01] about but they missed this
[2:23:05] one even today they don't
[2:23:10] understand did you get it now so now
[2:23:14] Jesus himself talked about Malachi 4 in
[2:23:17] two
[2:23:19] part fulfilled
[2:23:21] and the one which was coming so now the
[2:23:24] other one was John this one is William
[2:23:27] Bram Bram why because William Bram FS
[2:23:31] that
[2:23:34] qualification what that will do when he
[2:23:38] comes his message will not will not be a
[2:23:41] new message it will be straight to the
[2:23:45] Bible he will not preach new things he
[2:23:48] will preach the old things which the
[2:23:51] church has rejected he will bring them
[2:23:53] back again I challenge you this message
[2:23:58] has no new teaching every teaching of
[2:24:01] this message is what the old Bible says
[2:24:39] repentance repentance
[2:24:43] comes willing to hear to act upon the
[2:24:48] word it won't be long brother
[2:24:51] sister you know as long as you do that
[2:24:54] you yield
[2:24:55] yourself
[2:24:57] wholeheartedly you yield yourself
[2:24:59] heartedly under the power of the
[2:25:02] word God will F you with the
[2:25:14] Holy believing unto receiving the Holy
[2:25:17] Spirit but you see that is something
[2:25:20] that comes when you have fully yielded
[2:25:23] yourself to the to God and to allow him
[2:25:25] to do a work in
[2:25:28] you you have to empty
[2:25:31] yourself and let Christ feel you all
[2:25:35] right question number six is it wrong to
[2:25:37] pray delete these words in quotes delete
[2:25:40] my name from The Book of of death and
[2:25:42] write it in the Book of
[2:25:48] Life and he says support with
[2:25:53] scripture Ephesians
[2:25:55] 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in him
[2:25:58] before the foundation of the
[2:26:00] world that we should be holy and Without
[2:26:03] Blame before him in
[2:26:06] love when did he choose
[2:26:09] us when before the foundation of the
[2:26:13] world in him before the foundation of
[2:26:16] the world that we should be what holy
[2:26:20] Without
[2:26:22] Blame so my name was always in the book
[2:26:25] of
[2:26:27] life before I was even
[2:26:31] born 1 Peter 1:
[2:26:34] 18 for as much as ye know that you were
[2:26:37] not redeemed with corruptible
[2:26:40] things as silver and gold from your vain
[2:26:44] conversation received by tradition from
[2:26:46] your fathers
[2:26:50] okay verse 19 but but with the precious
[2:26:53] blood we were redeemed you can just say
[2:26:55] this by the precious blood of
[2:26:58] Jesus as of the Lamb without
[2:27:02] blaming and without sport who very was
[2:27:05] fored before the foundation of the
[2:27:09] world but was
[2:27:12] manifest was
[2:27:14] fored before the foundation of the world
[2:27:17] that was manifest in this last times for
[2:27:22] you who by
[2:27:24] him you believe in God that raised him
[2:27:28] up from the dead and gave him glory that
[2:27:33] your faith and your hope might be in
[2:27:38] God even the lamb which washed our
[2:27:43] sins amen was in him before the found
[2:27:50] before you ever did any
[2:27:53] sin you were washed and
[2:27:55] cleaned in before the
[2:27:57] found so there is nothing like
[2:28:00] praying oh God remove this person
[2:28:06] Sin from the book of death to the Book
[2:28:09] of
[2:28:10] Life what are you talking about my name
[2:28:13] has never been in any book of
[2:28:14] death there is no book of death at all
[2:28:17] in the Bible
[2:28:21] our names have always been in the Book
[2:28:23] of
[2:28:24] Life matter of fact for us as Believers
[2:28:29] our names are in a secret
[2:28:33] Chamber Of The Book of Life called the
[2:28:37] Lamb's Book of
[2:28:41] Life the names of those all those who
[2:28:44] would be Redeemed by the
[2:28:48] lamb it was written in the ink of
[2:28:52] blood canot be
[2:28:54] deleted it cannot be
[2:28:58] removed we have eternal
[2:29:02] security that is a good
[2:29:05] one praise the name of the
[2:29:08] Lord all right so there's there's other
[2:29:10] questions
[2:29:11] here
[2:29:14] amen I I understand there's a brother
[2:29:16] here called
[2:29:18] Danish is he around
[2:29:21] he stepped out okay how do I know that
[2:29:25] this is a a right kind of a woman to
[2:29:27] marry according to God's
[2:29:36] will
[2:29:38] amen very good
[2:29:41] question um I'm going to read from the
[2:29:44] from the marriage of the
[2:29:47] Lamb I have many scriptures and many
[2:29:49] quotes
[2:29:51] but I read what comes to for the moment
[2:29:53] because of time now marriage in one
[2:29:56] sense is a
[2:29:58] typ the Earthly marriage is um now let's
[2:30:02] go over read just for a few
[2:30:05] moments to rehearse it a moment the
[2:30:08] first thing that there
[2:30:10] is there must be a decision
[2:30:13] man the first thing takes in a natural
[2:30:15] marriage is a decision has to be made
[2:30:20] the young lady has to make a a young um
[2:30:22] her
[2:30:24] decision whether she wants this young
[2:30:26] man and the young man whether he wants
[2:30:28] this
[2:30:30] young there has to be a decision man and
[2:30:33] you have to make
[2:30:36] it she must be the only woman in the
[2:30:39] world that you
[2:30:41] love he must be the only
[2:30:45] man if it isn't then you made a wrong
[2:30:47] decision
[2:30:51] now before I continue he talks about a
[2:30:54] decision here but before a
[2:30:57] decision also says a man must
[2:31:01] pray of course also a woman
[2:31:03] prays but why a man must pray because it
[2:31:07] is I preached on it last time there a
[2:31:09] man who has a
[2:31:12] vision for his
[2:31:14] home the home he wants to have and
[2:31:17] that's why it is the man that chooses
[2:31:21] out of the many what kind of woman he
[2:31:24] wants what kind of woman will build his
[2:31:26] future
[2:31:28] dream the man himself must have a
[2:31:32] dream kind of home he want to
[2:31:35] have the kind of family you want to
[2:31:38] raise and then you know with that dream
[2:31:41] you go before the Lord in prayer you ask
[2:31:44] go to lead
[2:31:45] you and to guide you on who to
[2:31:48] choose and so the moment you
[2:31:51] see you know you will see maybe a
[2:31:55] sister or another and then another thing
[2:31:59] said that you cannot get one who has
[2:32:01] everything you've
[2:32:06] Dre if you think you have I think you
[2:32:09] were duped
[2:32:18] somewhere you can't find one
[2:32:21] has the list that you
[2:32:25] want I want someone who is brown someone
[2:32:28] who is tall someone who is having a long
[2:32:32] forehead and also a long nose I want
[2:32:36] someone who has a University
[2:32:38] degree I want someone who has a
[2:32:41] car someone now you have that
[2:32:45] that you may even get
[2:32:48] everything but you find the no is very
[2:32:51] short all looking very
[2:32:54] ugly say but this is not I but you can't
[2:32:57] have all
[2:32:58] things and you'll get this one who has
[2:33:01] every physical F you
[2:33:04] wanted but Spirit
[2:33:08] zero so then what are you going to do
[2:33:12] you
[2:33:13] choose according to your cor values
[2:33:20] first value
[2:33:23] must the first one is the
[2:33:26] character of a
[2:33:28] woman because it reflects your
[2:33:33] Ambitions you see she may not have all
[2:33:35] these educations and allal Futures but
[2:33:41] she has the character of
[2:33:44] Christ you clearly see God in
[2:33:47] her you raise your children
[2:33:53] let me tell you beauty is good the also
[2:33:57] says
[2:33:59] deceptive because Beauty flies
[2:34:03] away but I agree with you it is
[2:34:06] good I also not choose an ugly
[2:34:09] woman but if you want to choose right
[2:34:13] first don't consider
[2:34:17] Beauty don't consider Beauty
[2:34:20] don't consider
[2:34:22] Beauty my wife is beautiful
[2:34:24] out but I must confess to you she's not
[2:34:27] the most
[2:34:29] beautiful what did you just say it the
[2:34:32] truth even when I was choosing at that
[2:34:35] time there are others I saw that
[2:34:38] probably had better Futures on
[2:34:42] the but I
[2:34:45] weighed and I said this
[2:34:47] one this and this and this and
[2:34:50] she's the best I could choose in the
[2:34:52] whole
[2:34:53] world I'll choose
[2:34:56] her that is how you choose a
[2:34:58] woman a wife and then he continues the
[2:35:02] decision has to be
[2:35:04] made so when you choose her you don't go
[2:35:08] you know trying this and trying that and
[2:35:09] trying that one you know one thing I
[2:35:12] love from the Scripture it says war
[2:35:16] mongers and
[2:35:18] AD God will
[2:35:22] you better not be judged by
[2:35:25] God you better be judged here in the
[2:35:28] Jud conf your
[2:35:31] sin but God is
[2:35:33] Judgment has no
[2:35:36] mercy that's no
[2:35:39] Mery you go trying this
[2:35:42] one with every one
[2:35:44] of that you are choosing if you are
[2:35:47] choosing no one will even know you are
[2:35:49] choosing
[2:35:52] you will do it
[2:35:53] secretly some of you are making very big
[2:35:57] mistakes you see sisters and then you
[2:35:59] begin asking from your friends how do
[2:36:02] you see that one how do you see that
[2:36:05] that's the mistake come to your pastor
[2:36:08] the one who will give you an unbiased
[2:36:10] spiritual
[2:36:15] advice the rest will mislead
[2:36:18] you so
[2:36:20] sister is not to choose for
[2:36:25] yourself that one is the one I
[2:36:27] want and then you begin doing everything
[2:36:30] possible to get
[2:36:33] them if they choose someone else it's
[2:36:36] going to be a
[2:36:37] problem you don't you don't do that my
[2:36:39] sister you wait upon God when a brother
[2:36:46] comes also you've been in prayer
[2:36:49] brother says you will also
[2:36:52] choose you have right to
[2:36:55] choose you choose among those who have
[2:36:57] come to
[2:37:00] you not the ones you are looking
[2:37:04] around the ones who have come to
[2:37:08] you but he
[2:37:10] came and
[2:37:14] almost told me did he tell you
[2:37:21] no that's a problem on both
[2:37:24] sides why do you give sister
[2:37:27] hope and you almost
[2:37:30] tell and then you don't
[2:37:33] tell we used to have a
[2:37:35] sister especially these musicians you
[2:37:37] people should be very
[2:37:39] careful a brother was always there in
[2:37:42] the music department not in this church
[2:37:44] another church so the
[2:37:47] sister told us
[2:37:50] she confided in
[2:37:51] us this is
[2:37:53] many it's many years ago so no one will
[2:37:56] be embarrassed and so she said there is
[2:38:00] that
[2:38:01] bre that is about to propose to
[2:38:05] me we said how do you
[2:38:08] know he whenever he's playing the
[2:38:13] guitar and the music is
[2:38:15] nice he looks at me
[2:38:18] like I know
[2:38:20] time he's about to speak the
[2:38:24] word so many brothers
[2:38:27] came and the sister chest all of
[2:38:30] them just all of them and
[2:38:34] eventually the brother she was waiting
[2:38:36] for married someone
[2:38:39] else the sister almost had a heart
[2:38:43] attack I told her how sure are you is
[2:38:48] looking at you the people are so many
[2:38:50] no I always saw him I know what I
[2:38:55] saw he was always looking at
[2:38:59] me whenever I feel like it going to
[2:39:02] f but most importantly attend every
[2:39:06] Serv your private time you just meditate
[2:39:09] on his
[2:39:10] word that's the best way I know to
[2:39:15] main Amen to stay on fire for
[2:39:19] what is total
[2:39:21] forgiveness and how can it be done
[2:39:25] genuinely I don't know who has asked
[2:39:27] this question I've preached on
[2:39:31] forgiveness uh someone help me pull it
[2:39:33] up if you have
[2:39:35] it I'm not going to spend time on this
[2:39:37] one because I've preached on
[2:39:40] it I'm going to request you to go on our
[2:39:44] Channel and watch I'm trying to find the
[2:39:47] day it was preached
[2:39:50] uh I spoke a lot about it and gave many
[2:39:53] scriptures
[2:39:57] and the media Department can you get me
[2:39:59] the Debs
[2:40:09] kindly while they find it we
[2:40:12] can God bless you in case someone
[2:40:15] mistaken me promised to marry my sister
[2:40:18] to marry a sister
[2:40:19] [Music]
[2:40:24] sister and the sister
[2:40:26] accepts but without the knowledge of the
[2:40:29] pastor and parents can it be counted as
[2:40:32] a
[2:40:35] vow
[2:40:37] no as far as I'm
[2:40:39] concerned that's the only way I can
[2:40:41] answer that
[2:40:43] question before God it might be because
[2:40:48] God knows our heart
[2:40:50] but before people you have no
[2:40:53] proof so you cannot lay um even legally
[2:40:59] say that he promised
[2:41:02] you because you have no proof that's why
[2:41:06] you should involve the
[2:41:10] parents because if you don't you can be
[2:41:15] duped and someone will walk away with it
[2:41:20] so as far as I am
[2:41:22] concerned I cannot consider
[2:41:25] that unless if otherwise we've assisted
[2:41:28] to be
[2:41:31] that now the sermon forgiveness was
[2:41:34] preached
[2:41:37] uh on on 23rd
[2:41:41] June so go and listen to
[2:41:45] it it will help you so much to know
[2:41:48] about how how to forgive
[2:41:52] genuine I want to
[2:41:54] emphasize these things of
[2:41:57] AOW our Prophet has told us that a vow
[2:42:01] has to be
[2:42:03] made and has to be made in good
[2:42:09] faith
[2:42:10] yes in a good faith so how are you going
[2:42:14] to determine that someone is giving you
[2:42:16] a vow under good faith
[2:42:22] without
[2:42:27] proper both you and
[2:42:30] them there are many things to
[2:42:32] consider by the marriage is not
[2:42:35] easy it's not something that you do on
[2:42:38] like a
[2:42:39] debt it is something you must enter into
[2:42:44] sub the reason we are having a lot of
[2:42:47] issues people enter into it
[2:42:52] [Music]
[2:42:56] unly tell you for sure whether it's been
[2:42:59] advisably or
[2:43:02] unvis marriage remains a little bit
[2:43:07] complicated there will be things that
[2:43:08] will come
[2:43:09] up they will shake the the very
[2:43:12] foundations
[2:43:14] of if you had entered into it advis
[2:43:20] prayerfully in the fear of God the
[2:43:22] chances are that you will sail through
[2:43:25] all those
[2:43:27] Str but if you are not considering to be
[2:43:30] advised
[2:43:33] and things are going to be
[2:43:36] tough you need to really enter into
[2:43:41] advis don't just merely make a
[2:43:45] vow you know these younger men can be so
[2:43:47] excited sometimes
[2:43:50] you know someone just
[2:43:52] someone I've seen here some of them are
[2:43:57] here you know they come to
[2:44:01] say that
[2:44:03] sister she's the one are you sure I am I
[2:44:08] am sure have you prayed I am
[2:44:11] prayed but the way you see
[2:44:14] someone you tell them continue praying
[2:44:18] fast
[2:44:20] some of them I tell
[2:44:22] them praying for two
[2:44:25] months come back to me some of them come
[2:44:28] back I think it was
[2:44:32] my then you are
[2:44:34] wondering I thought you told me so you
[2:44:37] see why you need the pastor you need to
[2:44:40] be advised you are accepting you seeing
[2:44:42] someone who
[2:44:47] excited like for sure this is
[2:44:50] this is the m
[2:44:53] best and then all of the sudden you
[2:44:56] realize that it was not a genuine
[2:45:03] desire so you see how why you need to go
[2:45:05] to put God in your marriage
[2:45:09] plans God bless you Pastor I remember
[2:45:12] one time in your preaching you say that
[2:45:13] everything has a beginning has an end
[2:45:20] but then I heard another preacher saying
[2:45:22] that God wasn't God
[2:45:27] before he created us to worship
[2:45:30] Him does that mean that God has an
[2:45:36] end I also said that here both phrases
[2:45:39] have been spoken by Brother
[2:45:43] Bram it is him who said that everything
[2:45:46] that has a beginning has an end
[2:45:49] it is also him that say that God wasn't
[2:45:52] there was a time that God
[2:45:56] wasn't both myself and that
[2:45:59] preacher are quoting the same
[2:46:01] Prophet so we are not fighting against
[2:46:04] each other what I can say your question
[2:46:08] is does it mean that there was a that
[2:46:11] that does that mean that God has an
[2:46:16] end whatever has a beginning
[2:46:20] has an
[2:46:23] end in our
[2:46:27] understanding what is
[2:46:30] God in our human
[2:46:35] understanding what is God
[2:46:49] yes and therefore he can exist he
[2:46:53] existed before the
[2:46:56] creation exist after the creation it's
[2:46:59] not about his
[2:47:02] person it's about his
[2:47:06] creation and uh when it comes to his
[2:47:09] title as a
[2:47:12] son you know because God even as a son
[2:47:15] is has dispensations
[2:47:17] [Music]
[2:47:19] son of man Son of God Son of David and
[2:47:23] each of these has a
[2:47:25] dispensation and it will come to an end
[2:47:28] and the scripture says that when he has
[2:47:31] put all enemies under his
[2:47:34] feet then he
[2:47:37] himself is talking about the Son of God
[2:47:39] become
[2:47:41] subject to the father so you see
[2:47:45] whatever had a
[2:47:46] beginning has an end that's why you
[2:47:48] cannot say he's an eternal
[2:47:53] son says Eternal Father etal
[2:47:58] Son there is only one who is
[2:48:01] a and that is God but when we say
[2:48:05] God is before and after
[2:48:12] creation he himself has no
[2:48:15] end he has no beginning of
[2:48:20] you know even actually it is spoken of
[2:48:22] when it's speaking about
[2:48:24] MC and when it is talking about
[2:48:28] Christ talking about his
[2:48:31] priesthood can we read it somewhere
[2:48:36] here Hebrews chapter
[2:48:39] 7 vers
[2:48:41] um one for this mized king of Salem
[2:48:44] priest of the most high God who met
[2:48:46] Abraham returning from the slaughter of
[2:48:47] the Kings and blessed him to whom also
[2:48:50] Abraham gave a tenth part of all you
[2:48:53] know we ptie to God you know
[2:48:56] this first being by interpretation king
[2:48:59] of righteousness and after that also
[2:49:00] king of Salem which is king of peace
[2:49:03] without father without mother without
[2:49:05] descent having neither beginning of days
[2:49:08] nor end of life but made like unto the
[2:49:11] Son of God abideth a priest continually
[2:49:15] you can read
[2:49:17] it for
[2:49:33] [Music]
[2:49:59] praise God whether there is one to
[2:50:01] worship him or none to worship
[2:50:06] hims God is an object of
[2:50:09] worship whether he not being
[2:50:11] worshiped meaning when whether he not
[2:50:13] God oh that's what it actually means
[2:50:17] when we say God
[2:50:19] it means object
[2:50:21] of so he was there was a time when he
[2:50:23] was not
[2:50:25] being that means there was a time when
[2:50:28] he was not
[2:50:30] G right but he
[2:50:33] still he still was so whether he's being
[2:50:37] woried or
[2:50:38] not he's God we use the word God because
[2:50:42] we have no words in our
[2:50:47] vocabulary to
[2:50:50] explain but God is what can
[2:50:54] explain before us and after us whether
[2:50:57] we exist or whatever he
[2:51:02] remains let me say he remains who
[2:51:05] he with that father with that
[2:51:08] mother they said Mary Mother of God God
[2:51:10] has no
[2:51:13] mother without beginning of
[2:51:16] days and without end of life
[2:51:20] you are God from beginning to the
[2:51:23] end praise
[2:51:25] God God bless you Pastor my question is
[2:51:29] in the scripture Matthew
[2:51:31] 243 who are these
[2:51:35] elects I thought we shall already be
[2:51:37] with the
[2:51:41] Lord let's look at it right quick
[2:51:44] Matthew chapter 24
[2:51:51] vers
[2:52:00] three and Jesus went out and departed
[2:52:03] from the temple and his disciples came
[2:52:04] to him for to show him the beginning of
[2:52:08] the temple and Jesus uh said unto them
[2:52:10] see ye not all these things where I say
[2:52:14] unto you that there shall not be left
[2:52:15] here one stone upon another that shall
[2:52:17] not be thrown down and as he sat upon
[2:52:20] the mountain of Olives the disciples
[2:52:22] came unto him privately saying tell us
[2:52:25] when shall these things be and what
[2:52:27] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[2:52:29] the and of the end of the
[2:52:32] world is
[2:52:35] that 31 Matthew
[2:52:39] 2431 vers 31
[2:52:42] okay and he
[2:52:44] shall and he shall send his angels with
[2:52:47] a great sound of a trumpet and they
[2:52:49] shall gather together his elect from the
[2:52:52] Four Winds from one from one end of from
[2:52:56] one end of Heaven to the
[2:53:00] other okay can we begin from vers 27 for
[2:53:04] as the lightning cometh out of the East
[2:53:06] and shineth even unto the West so shall
[2:53:08] also the coming of the son of man be for
[2:53:11] whatsoever the carcass is there shall
[2:53:13] the Eagles be gathered together
[2:53:14] immediately after the tribulation of
[2:53:17] those days shall the son
[2:53:19] be darkened and the moon shall be uh
[2:53:22] shall not give her light and the Stars
[2:53:25] shall fall from Heaven and the powers of
[2:53:27] the heaven shall be shaken and then
[2:53:30] shall appear the sign of the son of man
[2:53:32] in heaven and then shall all the tribes
[2:53:34] of the earth mourn and they shall see
[2:53:37] the son of man coming in the Clouds Of
[2:53:40] Heaven with power and great glory and he
[2:53:45] shall send his angels with a great sound
[2:53:47] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[2:53:49] together his elect from the Four Winds
[2:53:52] from end from the from the from the end
[2:53:55] of Heaven to the other so now we notice
[2:53:59] here is speaking of um when in verse 30
[2:54:04] it says and shall appear the sign of the
[2:54:05] son of man in heaven and then shall the
[2:54:07] tribes of the earth mourn and they shall
[2:54:09] see the son of man coming in the Clouds
[2:54:12] Of Heaven with power and great
[2:54:15] Glory can you read that in Uganda
[2:54:19] uh uh 29
[2:54:53] actually brother bam does speak about
[2:54:57] this in the 6th
[2:55:00] seal if you go to the Sixth
[2:55:03] Seal um he talks about it and we
[2:55:08] understand the Sixth
[2:55:09] Seal is the Tribulation
[2:55:12] period uh because because by this time
[2:55:16] the bride has already gone
[2:55:19] but we understand there is also the
[2:55:22] elect from among the
[2:55:27] Jews because the
[2:55:31] 144,000 are not all the
[2:55:33] Jews they the elect from
[2:55:37] among this is not speaking of the
[2:55:40] bright then it says I have found many
[2:55:43] women preachers standing with scriptures
[2:55:45] like Mark 131
[2:56:01] Mark
[2:56:05] [Music]
[2:56:10] 131 okay and he came and took her by the
[2:56:14] hand and lifted her up and immediately
[2:56:16] the fever left her and she ministered
[2:56:18] unto
[2:56:30] them can you read for me Matthew 25 2755
[2:56:50] have you seen
[2:56:52] that
[2:56:54] um and many women were there beholding a
[2:56:57] far off which followed Jesus From
[2:56:59] Galilee ministering unto him and so the
[2:57:03] question is how were they then
[2:57:05] ministering to
[2:57:09] Jesus you know also let us read fon
[2:57:22] you know people blow scripture out of
[2:57:33] perspective let us read filon
[2:57:38] 13
[2:57:44] umon filon 13 filon is just next to
[2:57:49] Hebrews or rather before
[2:57:52] Hebrews behind
[2:57:54] Hebrews after
[2:57:56] Titus it says which okay I can begin
[2:57:59] actually reading from vers 8 wherefor
[2:58:03] though I might be much bold in Christ to
[2:58:05] enjoin thee that that which is
[2:58:08] convenient yet for Love's sake I rather
[2:58:11] be be SE thee being such an one as Paul
[2:58:15] the Aged and now also a prisoner of of
[2:58:18] Jesus Christ I beseech thee for my son
[2:58:20] onesmas whom I have begotten in my bones
[2:58:23] which in time passed was to
[2:58:42] be we find that there have been many
[2:58:45] people not only women
[2:58:49] that have ministered to
[2:58:53] ministers in the bondes of the
[2:58:56] Gospel if you want to see a very perfect
[2:59:00] example you will look at the shite
[2:59:04] woman and a man of
[2:59:06] God and even Elijah and that woman you
[2:59:10] know how you know she got a place for
[2:59:12] him minister to him by maybe giving food
[2:59:17] or
[2:59:18] taking care of physical things there
[2:59:22] have been women like that in the
[2:59:23] ministry from the very
[2:59:25] beginning you know so this is also how
[2:59:28] it
[2:59:29] was in The Book of Mark
[2:59:32] 131 these women were not ministering by
[2:59:38] preaching they were
[2:59:40] ministering to the ministers in the bond
[2:59:43] of the Gospel
[2:59:49] Paul had them Jesus had them even us we
[2:59:53] have them women who are always behind
[2:59:55] the
[2:59:56] scene actually women many women actually
[3:00:00] every Ministry you'll find there are
[3:00:03] many women sometimes they they are
[3:00:05] praying some of them are giving a lot of
[3:00:07] money others are you know doing things
[3:00:10] behind Somey
[3:00:12] clothes just wash the
[3:00:14] clothes when I was in Ethiopia you know
[3:00:16] this woman that really minister to us uh
[3:00:20] myself and my wife and when my wife was
[3:00:23] here in Uganda when with another brother
[3:00:26] she really minister to us she would come
[3:00:28] and cook you know so those women were
[3:00:31] ministering that
[3:00:33] way not
[3:00:36] preaching okay so that that can be
[3:00:39] clear so Peter's Peter's
[3:00:44] mother-in-law
[3:00:46] ministering by taking care of the
[3:00:50] men okay how many Heavens do we
[3:00:54] have and some light about them like I
[3:00:58] heard that brother bam went the third
[3:01:01] heaven and found his wife and daughter
[3:01:04] there so how many Heavens do we have
[3:01:07] Enlighten more about the foolish virgins
[3:01:10] and wise virgins
[3:01:12] [Music]
[3:01:14] [Laughter]
[3:01:26] okay and also it says um uh they want to
[3:01:31] get clarification of
[3:01:32] [Music]
[3:01:37] the all right so I just want to maybe
[3:01:41] give you a little bit of a for test of
[3:01:43] this not going in the details
[3:01:51] can you open in your
[3:01:54] Bible in the book of second
[3:02:00] Corinthians chapter 5
[3:02:24] we read verses 1 to
[3:02:27] 4 we know that if our Earthly House of
[3:02:30] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[3:02:33] building of God and a house not made
[3:02:35] with hands Eternal in the
[3:02:36] heavens can read
[3:02:53] for in this we grown honestly Desiring
[3:02:55] to be clothed upon
[3:02:58] with uh our house which is from
[3:03:06] Heaven if so be that being en closed we
[3:03:09] shall not be found naked for we that are
[3:03:13] in this Tabernacle do grown being
[3:03:16] burdened not for that which would be not
[3:03:18] not not that would be unclosed but
[3:03:20] closed upon that mortality might be
[3:03:23] swallowed up of life
[3:03:40] but so we could also take other
[3:03:42] scriptures like in the Book of
[3:03:44] Genesis where he talks about h you know
[3:03:48] in the
[3:03:48] beginning God created
[3:03:52] what he created
[3:03:56] what you're not answering what did he
[3:04:00] create Heaven and Earth okay so is are
[3:04:05] this talking about the second the same
[3:04:09] Heavens so there is different
[3:04:13] Heavens when we talk about the
[3:04:16] sky the Earth is
[3:04:19] atmosphere we call it
[3:04:22] heaven but there is also another
[3:04:24] Heaven that's the
[3:04:28] Galaxy people people did not know they
[3:04:31] found it out recently that there is
[3:04:34] actually
[3:04:36] [Music]
[3:04:39] more
[3:04:41] planets that others have been discovered
[3:04:44] others have never been discovered
[3:04:48] so when it says God created
[3:04:50] heaven heaven is large that's our second
[3:04:54] heaven the
[3:04:57] Galaxy but then in the third
[3:05:00] heaven is where the Believers
[3:05:04] go um it's a
[3:05:06] Celestial in what you would call the
[3:05:09] celestial
[3:05:13] Paradise it used to be that we were when
[3:05:17] we would die before the resurrection of
[3:05:18] Jesus
[3:05:20] Christ then we would we would go uh down
[3:05:24] in in in
[3:05:26] hell this kind of paradise used to be a
[3:05:29] portion in
[3:05:31] hell but when Jesus rose again from the
[3:05:35] the Believers now don't go to hell when
[3:05:37] they
[3:05:38] die those who die not in Christ they
[3:05:40] suddenly go to
[3:05:43] hell in the regions of the dam
[3:05:47] go there but now the Believers when they
[3:05:51] die they go to that to that Celestial
[3:05:55] Paradise they go to heaven but this is
[3:05:58] not where God is
[3:06:00] also but then that that you would call
[3:06:02] the third heaven this you would call the
[3:06:04] third heaven where the Believers
[3:06:07] go that's where brother bam would find
[3:06:10] his
[3:06:12] other this is where all of them
[3:06:15] are but you see after after that you
[3:06:19] will find that there will there is um uh
[3:06:23] the real of
[3:06:25] angels another
[3:06:27] dimension and then after that you'll
[3:06:30] find another dimension where God himself
[3:06:33] is so even those who are dead in Christ
[3:06:37] they currently not with
[3:06:39] God they are waiting just like we
[3:06:42] waiting when he comes when the tapet is
[3:06:45] blown and at the last of
[3:06:48] the then the dead in Christ those who
[3:06:51] are in that
[3:06:53] third will come and then we will be
[3:06:56] changed and together we will meet the
[3:06:59] Lord in the
[3:07:01] air he says that I Enlighten more about
[3:07:04] the foolish
[3:07:06] virgins and the wise
[3:07:09] virgins the foolish virgins don't
[3:07:12] receive the Holy
[3:07:14] Spirit even they claim to have beli the
[3:07:16] word
[3:07:18] but they don't receive the Holy Spirit
[3:07:20] and the wise
[3:07:22] virgins receive the holy spirit that is
[3:07:24] the biggest distinction between
[3:07:27] [Music]
[3:07:28] them that's why it is a must for you to
[3:07:30] receive the
[3:07:32] holy if you don't receive the Holy
[3:07:35] Spirit you you are
[3:07:39] risking you might end up
[3:07:42] remaining the foolish virgins go through
[3:07:45] the tribulation
[3:07:48] The
[3:07:49] Virgins are hairs to eternal
[3:07:55] life does that make sense I've preached
[3:07:58] on it here before their hairs to eternal
[3:08:00] life they will get eternal life that's
[3:08:03] old they will
[3:08:04] get but the bride gets more than eternal
[3:08:08] life she goes in the Rapture she goes in
[3:08:11] the
[3:08:12] Millennium you know she goes in the
[3:08:14] marriage supper is then in the
[3:08:16] millennium
[3:08:19] then also has eternal life
[3:08:21] of so that's the difference and we are
[3:08:23] the wise virgins the
[3:08:29] bride okay I hope that is also
[3:08:32] sufficient now why should we
[3:08:37] P this must have been a very frustrated
[3:08:42] person praise the
[3:08:44] Lord but I think it's a good question
[3:08:48] we I just read for
[3:08:49] you
[3:08:53] here in in the book of
[3:08:57] Hebrews where he says Abraham paid
[3:09:02] tith vers 2 Hebrews
[3:09:05] 7 Abraham is the father of of our faith
[3:09:09] and he paid TI because he was a
[3:09:12] Believer all those who are believers in
[3:09:15] God they P TI
[3:09:18] God as a
[3:09:20] recognition that all the
[3:09:24] blessings that you
[3:09:28] receive from
[3:09:31] God and you always everything to
[3:09:35] him you know someone told me
[3:09:39] recently I thought you paid TI on only
[3:09:43] Sly and never ear Sly so I
[3:09:48] what about the ones who do
[3:09:50] business what what about the ones who
[3:09:53] never really have
[3:09:56] Sal as as long as God blesses
[3:10:00] you with
[3:10:02] something income you have to
[3:10:07] pay could be a
[3:10:09] gift could be something that you have
[3:10:11] received
[3:10:12] from you TI it because it is an income
[3:10:15] something that has come to
[3:10:18] and um I'll just give you an
[3:10:21] answer directly from the scripture
[3:10:24] Malachi
[3:10:33] 3
[3:10:39] says vers 8 will a man rob God yet he
[3:10:44] have robbed me but ye say wherein have
[3:10:45] we robbed thee in TI and
[3:10:56] offerings he are cast with a
[3:10:59] cur for you are robbed with you have
[3:11:01] robbed me even this whole
[3:11:05] nation bring all you bring you all your
[3:11:07] tis into the
[3:11:10] storehouse there may be meat in my
[3:11:12] house and that prove me now here with a
[3:11:16] lot of
[3:11:17] if I not open you the windows of
[3:11:22] heaven and power you out of
[3:11:24] blessing that there shall not be room
[3:11:26] enough to
[3:11:28] receive so if you want a
[3:11:31] blessing God said test him by paying
[3:11:34] your TI and by giving
[3:11:37] offerings but the question is
[3:11:40] why come of
[3:11:42] it but why do weay in the Old Testament
[3:11:46] was paid by all the
[3:11:49] tribes to the tribe to the tribe of
[3:11:53] Le and these were the
[3:11:56] priests they did not have any land they
[3:11:59] were not doing any job they were only
[3:12:02] attending to the altar to the word of
[3:12:05] God and so God said to the others you
[3:12:09] have all the uh
[3:12:11] Fields now you cultivate go work labor
[3:12:16] and all the ties
[3:12:18] that one is mine and then he came this
[3:12:21] side he said the Levites that is my
[3:12:24] tribe I'll take care of it so then he
[3:12:28] says where is my 10% give it to me bring
[3:12:32] it to the L let them take care of it on
[3:12:35] my behalf so this was God's
[3:12:38] reward to the Levites to be able to run
[3:12:42] the work of the
[3:12:43] temple so it is the same thing today it
[3:12:47] never changed that God when when it
[3:12:50] comes to rewarding labor to rewarding
[3:12:53] those who serve in the work of the
[3:12:56] ministry it still requires the Believers
[3:12:59] to pay
[3:13:01] TI and if you pay your
[3:13:04] tyes they help the
[3:13:07] pastor they help the
[3:13:09] preacher to continue preaching to you oh
[3:13:13] Pastor where is that in the
[3:13:15] Bible how many want to see
[3:13:18] no one
[3:13:21] okay all right let us go in our
[3:13:25] Bibles and uh read about
[3:13:30] that
[3:13:35] okay Romans um well we can read 1
[3:13:39] Corinthians chapter
[3:13:42] 9 ver um
[3:13:47] 11 yeah can read from
[3:13:51] 11 really it begins from up there but
[3:13:56] um let us begin from
[3:14:00] n for it is written in the law of Moses
[3:14:03] that thou sh not musle the ox the mouth
[3:14:05] of the ox that treadeth out the corn do
[3:14:08] God take care of for o oxen
[3:14:19] oh sayth he eat all together for our
[3:14:26] sex you know he's talking about the ox
[3:14:29] that
[3:14:30] digs he says don't don't tie it
[3:14:36] mouth when it is don't mistreat
[3:14:40] it when it is digging for you says does
[3:14:44] he really talk about the oxen
[3:14:48] or is meaning us the people for our
[3:14:52] sakes no doubt this is
[3:14:56] written that he that plowe should plow
[3:14:59] in
[3:15:02] hope he that plow should plow in
[3:15:07] Hope and that he that threshes in Hope
[3:15:11] should be partaker of his hope
[3:15:19] imagine brother Brian you go somewhere
[3:15:20] they give you a house to
[3:15:23] paint you happy you begin painting and
[3:15:27] when you are done child God bless you
[3:15:30] thank
[3:15:31] you really after all this work you will
[3:15:35] be shocked you'll be
[3:15:38] surprised in the same way he says he
[3:15:41] that
[3:15:42] works should work in Hope
[3:15:47] if we have sown unto you spiritual
[3:15:51] things is it a great thing that we
[3:15:53] should also reap canel
[3:15:58] things matal
[3:16:03] things he studies he after go he doesn't
[3:16:08] even have time to go for a job
[3:16:11] somewhere and people are calling him
[3:16:13] throughout the week meeting this one and
[3:16:15] that one and at the end of the day you
[3:16:19] earn your salary and there's a TI for
[3:16:23] what
[3:16:25] really when the whole week you are very
[3:16:28] busy disturbing the pastor calling him
[3:16:30] at midnight oh pray for us but you can't
[3:16:34] pay 10% the
[3:16:36] Lord to help the
[3:16:39] pastor he said if we have sown to you
[3:16:41] spiritual
[3:16:43] things is it a great thing if you should
[3:16:47] reap your kind of
[3:16:49] things so your
[3:16:51] Tye is is being raped by
[3:16:57] somebody who is showing to you
[3:17:01] spiritual if others be partakers of this
[3:17:04] power over you are not we rather so Paul
[3:17:08] was teaching
[3:17:10] something he said it is
[3:17:12] okay but for he as a
[3:17:14] man he was an apostle
[3:17:17] he decided he will not use
[3:17:19] it and people were not collecting or
[3:17:22] giving to
[3:17:23] you but he said it is
[3:17:27] obvious if someone
[3:17:29] labors if I have a minister come
[3:17:32] here like if I have usually ministers
[3:17:34] who
[3:17:35] come and when they preach don't think I
[3:17:38] just tell them God bless
[3:17:40] you because it is taken that they came
[3:17:42] to support my
[3:17:45] Ministry so I must also reward
[3:17:50] their I don't just tell God bless you go
[3:17:54] in no we all appreciate it and we put we
[3:17:59] usually put something here collect
[3:18:03] some usually I even
[3:18:06] add so that someone can it can help them
[3:18:10] so that's how it has to be so our paying
[3:18:14] of our tithe
[3:18:16] told us it does not go to building of
[3:18:18] the
[3:18:21] church it does not go to
[3:18:24] Renovations that one goes to the
[3:18:26] preaching
[3:18:28] Ministry it goes to the pastor
[3:18:31] personally I don't even use
[3:18:33] tithe I use it to support the
[3:18:36] ministry but however it is used it

[3:19:03] ones is the first Exodus second ex Third
[3:19:06] Exodus the first
[3:19:09] Exodus was the children of is leaving
[3:19:13] Egypt going to the promis

[3:19:32] Exodus was from the
[3:19:34] law to Grace the Third Exodus is what is
[3:19:39] going on
[3:19:41] now from
[3:19:43] denominations to
[3:19:45] Christ so we are in the Third
[3:19:50] Exodus which one are they two brids that
[3:19:55] Prophet talked I can't understand what
[3:19:57] this brother wrote or sister I think
[3:19:59] it's a brother the ones they the ones
[3:20:00] who write badly like
[3:20:02] this which ones are they two Brides that
[3:20:08] Prophet talked about I don't understand
[3:20:11] your question I hope I don't know what
[3:20:13] you mean but there's only one bride
[3:20:19] only
[3:20:20] one if you here and you ask this
[3:20:23] question and you want to clarify you can
[3:20:24] raise
[3:20:29] up yes are you the one who wrote
[3:20:36] this okay can someone can someone can
[3:20:40] someone give her the microphone
[3:20:51] okay thank you Pastor um we are reading
[3:20:54] today the church edges and then uh there
[3:20:58] is something that the prophet had said
[3:21:00] somewhere there about uh that the the
[3:21:03] two the two brids who were deceived so I
[3:21:07] was wondering is there another one who
[3:21:09] is the first which message was that
[3:21:17] Pam
[3:21:22] Church how can you tell the spirit
[3:21:26] apart just give them the word
[3:21:29] test if they don't speak that word they
[3:21:33] are of the evil one as the evil one
[3:21:35] deceived the first two
[3:21:39] bright he will try to deceive the Bride
[3:21:42] of this last
[3:21:44] day by trying to get had to hybridize
[3:21:47] herself through
[3:21:51] Creed the first bride who was
[3:21:54] deceived was Adam's
[3:21:57] bride and you know in Eve she was
[3:22:00] deceived according to First Timothy
[3:22:02] chapter I think
[3:22:05] three uh we can get that right quick
[3:22:08] here first Timothy
[3:22:13] chapter I think two
[3:22:18] [Music]
[3:22:19] um
[3:22:21] vers 14 and Adam was not
[3:22:24] deceived but the woman being
[3:22:27] deceived was in the transgression so the
[3:22:30] first Eve was
[3:22:32] deceived then the second Eve who was the
[3:22:36] church who was supposed to be the bride
[3:22:38] of
[3:22:39] Christ also got
[3:22:41] deceived um and you know went into
[3:22:44] denominationalism and so now Christ has
[3:22:48] his own
[3:22:50] elect in this last day that has called
[3:22:54] out out of the church system which was
[3:22:57] deceived and this one won't be deceived
[3:23:00] by Creeds and
[3:23:01] dogmas and hybridization of
[3:23:04] denominational doctrines and
[3:23:07] things she's going to be a perfect bride
[3:23:10] without sport without
