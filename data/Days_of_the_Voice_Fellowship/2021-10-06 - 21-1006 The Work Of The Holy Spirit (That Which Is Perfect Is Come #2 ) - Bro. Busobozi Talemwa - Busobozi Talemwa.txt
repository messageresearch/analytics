that which is in part shall be done away amen amen then let us look at uh verse what is shame this you need to sort this out daniel chapter sure enough someone done it we look at verse four i need a coming fbd but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal up the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased i want to greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus [Music] christ it's a wonderful time once again for us to be in the house of the lord uh we have been having many testaments coming in today with you the sister that i'll share the testimony with the church nagam assistant tourism mr munyana called me i think it was yesterday i'm not quite sure but i think it was yesterday that's the family that came to join us last uh the last service here on sunday yes and she's told me that my daughters have testimonies to share nan you know with julie she gave me the two of our daughters one is peace and another one i think is sarah is that correct say that during the time of the word she saw angels ascending and descending in this place and then another one the other side she said that she saw the pill of fire yeah amen amen hallelujah amen well this this is already two people banana to baby and you know that the bible says by the word of two or three witnesses ability do you want to greet us just for a minute when you're gonna choose that point i gotta take it again one minute yes that you can give me the microphone let him greet us god bless you saints and by the names of hosea having a praise and i come from the holy spirit way bible church from masaka and i follow him the second time then joel the third time yes the sense that i sent you greetings in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you amen prayer is the name of the lord so this is this uh afternoon uh i i don't know whether it's afternoon or evening some good afternoon evening i thought i should speak because on sunday the lord willing i will not be around uh i'll be traveling this um probably on friday we have a a wedding there junior in baguio and also uh we have something else that is going to take place there it is you're welcome we have no uh membership but we have fellowship they're trying to remember what amen amen so i'm going to be speaking on the second part of what i was speaking on on sunday [Music] i don't think it's a new it's just going to be the continuation of sunday so i want you to be sober because we have only one hour no reason and sometimes when the word is preached a bit fast fast uh pray for my interpreter is not used to interpreting for him amen amen all right so uh uh you know when when we are preaching very fast uh sometimes you may not get everything i know that it turns and that's one of the reasons why we record these meetings later when you have more time you can go back on youtube and begin to listen to youtube so this evening of course on sunday i was speaking on the that which is perfect is amen amen uh we have read in the book of daniel of course we read this question some of these beats we read them already in the previous services every single time someone called services but i wanted to follow me very well [Music] of course we'll take you deeper into the knowledge of the world but the purpose is meant to make you or to bring you into the right atmosphere to receive the holy spirit chapter 12 verse 1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble and such as never was since there was a nation even to that time even to that same time and at that time the people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in that in the dust of the earth shall awake some everlasting life and some shame and everlasting content and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the family and they that turn out many righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased [Music] foreign foreign hallelujah amen now we noticed here in the book of daniel tulane how many do not understand english here today sorry whatever let me just use one language because i notice i may end up people may end up losing everything hallelujah all right so if there is someone online i know there are some people who fellowship with us and cannot understand english at all so if they are there they are just going to operate we are apologizing to them today so now we are speaking on the that which is uh that that which is perfect is come and how many have ever read the book of daniel here raise up your hand okay what about the book of revelation raise up your hand now the book of revelation and the book of daniel has much in common do you know why because the book of revelation speaks of the things that are the things which which we shall be and the things which was and daniel the book of daniel does the same thing so we notice here in the book of daniel chapter 12 the bible is speaking about the book which was sealed it was sealed and daniel of course the angel told him daniel shout out the words and seal the book even to the time of the end so meaning you remember we talked about this and i told you that there would come a time which would be the time of the end of the ceiling of the book and here give me revelation chapter five let us also read it now as you are giving me revelation chapter 5 we have also read the book of first corinthians chapter 13 verse 10 which says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away hallelujah so we realized that it's going to be there was a time when there was something but when it was not yet perfect of course the time of paul i showed you that paul was the one who was laying the foundation of the church he was laying the foundation of faith but then there comes a time when perfection comes to the church and we know that perfection comes listen to this now that perfection of the church comes at the end of the ceiling of the book which was sealed in the book of daniel or which was sealed from we do not know when but that book was suit for a real long time so we said at that time the ceiling of that book will come to an end the people who will see the end of the ceiling of that book will be a blessed people the people who shall see in other words the opening of the book will be a blessed people and those people shall be called the people of the open book hallelujah amen they will not have a sealed book anymore but now there will be amen having a book which is now open hallelujah of course the mystery will be now open now look at revelation chapter five verse one to four you can follow unders on the screen here okay he says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side please follow this sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals they are on and and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on have you seen that this is the same book that daniel saw this is the symbol that now john is also seeing hallelujah and what was the status of this book it was sealed it was not open yet it was sealed and verse 4 and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read a book nay that looked there on i wanted to say some very important thing here no man on earth no man in heaven was worthy even today there is no matter that's why that's the very big difference that we in the message have with the denominations the denominations look at a man for leadership the denominations look at as a group of men for leadership but in the message we do not in the message we look to the one who was worthy because remember there was no man that was worthy therefore there is no man that can tell you what to do that will give you eternal life there is no man who was worthy to open the book and to lose the seals there is no man who was worthy to bring redemption by the way this closed book was a a book brother banh called it the book of redemption hallelujah and so the catholic church has a man that they look up to and that man is the one who will tell you whether you are a saint or not but i'm glad when you receive this man of the bible the man who are talking about the one who was working we shall find out who he is amen when you receive him when you accept him when you even follow his words amen his words make you a saint even before you die we don't have to die to become a saint and we don't need someone else to tell us we are saints whether we are dead or alive and remember your death does not change you death only changes your wedding place amen if you die if when you are a sinner you remain a sinner if you die as saint you remain ashamed you cannot be a sinner on earth and then you die and someone make you a saint no therefore we are so glad that this morning i aim and this evening i'm speaking to saints we are saints hallelujah we don't need to die to become saints we are saints only because we have accepted the one who was worthy we are saved because we have received the one amen who was worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof some people have thought that the one who was whether to open the book and lose the seals was by the parliament no he wasn't remember he said there was no man hallelujah there was no one in heaven no one on earth not even angel gapier not even angel michael not even mary magdalene or mary whoever not even marry the mother of jesus christ not even any prophet not even ezekiel not even daddy not even isaiah not even brother burn i'm not even anyone there was no man not any pastor bishop or whoever that you think some people even they have names but abandoned calls them uh famous names i told you that sometimes you want to call someone and to refer to them you have to first do that before you speak their name you have to put a title that will take almost a full page bishop apostle evangelist reverend doctor phd and then before you know you you know it has other titles and then now you say even the name has a hd then almost they will not mention the name hallelujah they have famous names but what about the one who was worthy amen he is simply called jesus hallelujah not dr jesus just jesus hallelujah and i tell you he is the only one who was worthy amen to check the book and to lose the seals thereof amen and we see here the reason why i read uh corinthians first christians because it says that which is perfect is come when that which is perfect is that was a prophecy amen paul was not speaking something which has already happened paul was not saying that which is perfect is come paul was saying when that which is perfect is come amen paul was saying now we are preaching in part now we have half prophecy but there is time coming when the end of the prophecy will come when the whole prophecy will be fulfilled and that is the time of the end of the ceiling of the book are you getting it that time of the end hallelujah when the book will be opened when the sales will be loosed amen then you can have an open book and therefore that which is perfect will come at that time hallelujah in other words he was prophesying of something to come he was talking of something to come and i tell you that thing does not come until the end amen of the of the ceiling of the book comes and i want us to look at verse revelation chapter 10 and i know i went through these things but i have to keep going through them until we'll capture the revelation i want to look at revelation chapter 10 verse 1 to 7. hallelujah and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven crossed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth who did he see are you following who did you see read it the way you see it who did you see another mighty angel amen where did he come down from from heaven who is this angel he is the angel who was close with a cloud and he's also the angel who had a rainbow around upon his head his feet was actually the sun and his feet was a pill of fire now let me tell you who this angel is this is the same angel that represents what john saw in revelation chapter 5 you are going to switch back to revelation chapter 5 quickly now revelation chapter 5 look at that these are certain things that we as a church need to understand very very well okay i didn't have it here i was just relying on you brother look at look at that revelation chapter 5 verses 5. okay right there okay whoever has their phone off and one of the elders said unto me whip not of course john wept much because because he found he found no one that was worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own there was no one worthy okay because john found no one was worthy he now wept much because no man was found worthy amen that's why i get the part of man there was no man found worthy to open and to read the book they are on so john wept march and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and lose the seven seals there oh hallelujah so now this was a book amen keep that there this was a book that was sealed with seven seals and there was no man worthy to open the book no to look there upon and because of that the bible says that john wept much because there was no man worthy so there was no one whether to lose the seals to remove the seals to open the book and the book was closed why because that time of the end of the mystery had not yet come there was a time even before the foundation of the world in the mind of god when the end of the time of the end of the mystery of this seventh sealed book would come that time amen would be amen the capping off of the church remember we found out in you know some of you have just come in may not understand but if you listen to the services on youtube before you understand where we are but you will notice that the church has been in building from level one level to the other hallelujah i don't know if i have this picture maybe just give you a small picture of what i'm speaking about hallelujah let's see if i can be able to do that i did not uh prepare to show it to you again today so you'll excuse me if i cannot get it quickly do you have a picture brother hallelujah okay so it looks like i am not going to be able to show you that picture because i did not prepare but some of you you can see that there right there on the on the on the station of the perfect man that that picture which has a statue of a perfect man you see it goes from faith on down to charity to god to love perfect love and it has been from the ages from the very first age to the second edge third age fourth a fifth hey look why am i talking about what i'm talking about people are lost because of lack of knowledge we need to understand what time we are living in people are just christians without even knowing where they are going where they are coming from what they are supposed to do now we find out in the book in the bible here one great prophet one of the prophets we know was a mighty prophet and his name is daniel the bible tells me he was able to know by the books of another prophet what time they were living in hallelujah he was able to take him in the book of signatures of prophet isaiah and he read and he found out how he was at the time of the ending of israel on israel being out of our homeland it was the last last year it was the last season amen but it was out of match from out of much crying and praying and interceding for his people he had this burden he needed to know what time is he living in you remember the other day the other time i asked i told you of someone who asked a baby who asked a big person who had come actually to preach in their home he said which generation are we in and the big man said pretty much we are in the mutavis generation some people think that way we are immutably generation pretty much look we need to know what is the what generation are we living in what time are we living in do we believe in the coming of the lord is he coming when is it coming what sign shall we see what things will happen is the end of the world coming oh it is not coming some people think because the world has been continuing on for ages it's going to continue like this and this others even believe there is no end others believe we shall be extinct and then after another nation another human race will come you know people have all sorts of ideas and ideologies on what is going to happen why because they do not read the bible but i tell you this bible here amen has all the mysteries in it and there are people ordaining every generation to understand the time they're living in and when they understand it even they seize the moment and after they seize the moment they prepare themselves for what is coming and we know what is coming hallelujah we know the coming of the lord is right here amen we know he's coming soon how many believe that now let me tell you according to prophecy this sealed book would no longer be sealed but that time of its end to be sealed would come but there are certain things we would know that that end has come and that's what we are trying to look at now john wept give me that verse again verse 5 chapter 5 and when john wept then a voice told him that weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judas prevailed and then when john turned to see the lion of the tribe of judah what did he see brother what did he see he saw he's so alarmed as he it was slain when please answer me now before the foundation of the world hallelujah he's so alarmed he did not only see a lamb but he's so alone full of blood and when did that lamb get bloody when was it killed islam was not alive it was a dead lamb and he saw that islam was killed before even the foundation of the world amen who is that lamb that lamb is jesus christ the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world when was jesus killed he was killed before you were born when was he killed he was killed before the foundation of the world which means amen when did we when when were we redeemed when were we saved we were actually saved listen to this now we were actually saved before the foundation of the world hallelujah here we are here only to recognize who we are amen some people prayed when someone becomes saved oh god remove his name from the book of death and place it in the name in the book of life this is no sense your name has never been in the book of death never your name has always been on the book of life hallelujah and let me even take it a step further your name was on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world but you was in sin you were born in sin shaped in iniquity not you but actually your flesh hallelujah amen and when you came amen you heard from your theophany your friend is the other body which was not a sinner which had never seen that part of you which was always godly amen but it left you you were separated from it because of the way you were born you are born out of the lust of the flesh and you are born in sin and so when you hear the word of god you recognize hey i was wrong i was a sinner then you repent by the time you repent amen you are reunited hallelujah with the person that you really was supposed to be hallelujah all that is the work of the holy spirit not the work of man actually when by the time we are done with this you will see that redemption and salvation is not the work of a man redemption and salvation is the work of the holy ghost that is why without the holy ghost you can never see god without the holy spirit you can never be saved without the holy spirit you can never go in the rapture amen hallelujah and so we see that this book was sealed but you see when john came to see when the voice told him i'll leave that part i think i'll explain in the coming meetings you see who this elder was but let me just proceed he says when when one of the elders told him he said weep not john the lion of the time of jesus prevailed and when he turned to see the lion who had prevailed he saw a lamb as it was trained before the foundation of the world and that lamb i told you was jesus christ amen his coming on the cross was a fulfillment of what he had already done remember his thought before it becomes a word is a thought and before before it actually happens he has already predetermined it and we say that the lamb went on the cross and died for us and that's when he lose the book but when he lose the book the seals did not become opened before the eyes of the people the people were still sitting across the book why because their eyes were blind jesus came and told them you have eyes but you can't see in other words i am the lamb who has come to open the book but you can't see because they were calling him they were calling him head of demons but they did not know this was the very one that was prophesied in their scrolls in their verses that they read in their temples every day they did not know it was he that was prophesied that he would come they did not even have an idea that this is the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world they didn't have an idea that this is the one daniel talked about amen they didn't have an idea this was the one isaiah talked about all the prophets talked about he had now come to fulfill his work of prophecy amen his work which was written after him or before him he had now come to fulfill it and they called him the head of demons they did not know who he was and to them the book remained sealed and the book has remained sealed to them until today the book has remained still until today they have this bible but i tell you this bible to them is a closed book they can't understand it amen but in every generation there is a group of people who will understand who will see the book open to them amen they have the bible but they can't see it he said you have eyes but you can't see you have ears but you can't hear why because their ears are closed their eyes are closed they are blind as a bat oh my how can they not see that baptism is supposed to be in the name of our lord jesus christ how can they claim they're in churches i say the churches don't live in a classroom like this one but i mean they're mega churches so called and they come to bring a choir and it's all about entertaining people they are dressed to impress you do you hear what i say they are dressed to kill they are dressed to impress the the the people it's all about a show you know like what you said let us go to a show it's a show even when a preacher comes he doesn't come to heal the sick but he comes to make a show so it can be shown on the tv show so that the people can bring in money amen they are blind they can't see that these things is nowhere in the scripture they are forgotten about holiness these things of saying that a boy should not touch a girl until marriage those things they can't understand it say what you mean you have no girlfriend you know they used to call you a fool in the world you mean you have no girlfriend at your age you're 20 and you have no girlfriend say well i have no one why because i'm not yet ready to marry you don't need to be ready to matter you only have to you need to have a girlfriend because you're of age that thing is to be worldly but these days even in the churches you find them having girlfriends and boyfriends show me anyone in the bible who was a girlfriend of someone the boyfriend of someone the only one we know is mary and joseph and these were not only a girlfriend and boyfriend but they were exposed to one another they were engaged to one another everyone knew about it it wasn't a secret affair but you see why are these things happening in the church today why because their eyes are closed they are blinded why do you find people baptizing babies children in the name of the holy trinity even the so-called pentecostals father son holy ghost they are doing the same thing of the catholic church there's catholicism everywhere when where do you find the trinity here it's nowhere to differ why do they do those things because they are blind they are reading from a closed book they can't understand it but in every generation like i said there are people that god by his grace amen will open the mystery too they will understand it hallelujah i mean it happened in the first age it happened in the second age they thought the fourth until the sick when it reaches the seventh age amen you know what is going to happen by the polycarp the end of the whole mystery hallelujah he was opening mystery one by one but by the end amen of the ages the whole mystery of god hallelujah would be unveiled i want you to look at revelation 10 now verse 1. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close to the cloud and that rainbow was upon his head and his face was it was as it was the sun and his feet has been as a fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and he left food on the earth who is this angel hallelujah who is this angel i asked do you know who this angel this angel was jesus christ this is the same lamb that we see in the book of revelation chapter 5 verse 5. it's the same one but this time are you following me in revelation 10 he now comes down with our open book he comes to declare hallelujah you know what what happens in the heavens happens here on earth it shows what is happening on the earth and this happened at one time in america in uh not to say the literal scripture but it's the symbol of it in the 19 i believe 1963 it was yes in february 1963 they made a magazine it's called life magazine and that there was a cloud that was photographed in america 1963 i wish i had it but maybe in the next meeting i'll prepare it and that life magazine had both the crowd and the rainbow over it like this these people who are doing who photograph this and put it in the paper were not believers but the cloud appeared at a place where there is no moisture to say that moisture can happen to form a cloud this thing happened there because it was supernatural showing and you know what that cloud was a crowd overhead you remember what i was telling you the body was now mature in maturing until the time even when the head comes and rests on the body from that time when that cloud you know that rainbow appeared there was something at that same season happening on the earth it was in 1963 who was born then raise up your hand here no one was born there but it is in history it is known everybody knows it that is the same time when god was calling his servant a man in america and he was at that same season at that same time going to preach on the revelation of the seven seals and god had already prepared him for some time for this to happen are you following me now i wanted to look at that bus very well brother are you giving it to me chapter 10 verse yes verse 2 and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and he is left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as a when a lion roared and when he had cried i was going to lie in it and when he had cried hand has uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices john was about to write and when he had the voice meaning john had a voice from heaven saying unto me at the same time when john had the voice when the seventh hand has uttered their voices john was going to what what does it mean it means that when the seventh time has acted it was it wasn't just something like that but it had a meaning to it so there was contents of these standards that were uttering and john was about to write the contents of the seven thunders which he had uttering their voices and then a voice from heaven came unto him saying seal up those things which the seventh thunders uttered and write them note don't write the contents of the seven standards don't write them seal them up now some people have sought to even say these seven thunders is different from the seals and therefore it is nothing to do with what the seventh angel messenger will do but my purpose here is to show you even that when this when when god said the last day messenger amen he will finish the mystery of god and actually in the church in the i don't know if i have it here keep that there in the in the the the church edge book yes in the church edge book i think i read that spot for you here i don't have it in my front here but it was saying that the seventh angel messenger uh-huh it is right here let me read it for you you can put it up if you want you we shall come back to this and i'm watching my time too now this message of malachi 4 and revelation 10 and 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that's the first thing and i want to tell and to announce to all of you who do not know this messenger of malachi 4 has already come he was the one who fulfilled the scripture of elijah coming in the end time to call out a bride out of the denominations and his message has sounded and we have responded hallelujah amen that is the first thing he's going to do number two he will reveal brother which message are you reading from number two he will reveal the mysteries because these things sense him i want people to see it's from the message number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in who is going to reveal the mysteries the message of malachi 4 revelation 27 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 we are come on now read with me which are the words the revelations so the revelations i mean in other words the mysteries of the seven thunders are the revelations contained in the seals hallelujah we don't need another messenger special man to come and reveal the seven standards it has already been revealed hallelujah this message is seven standards my friend why because the seals have been broken by who not by brother but by the lamb hallelujah now i want you to follow me here he says [Music] when i whisper in revelation 5 10 then he says and swear by him and limit forever and ever who created heaven and earth this angel who came with my angel around his head and he had what else rainbow around is that of course this shows that he was the age of the covenant amen and so that is jesus christ how we are able to know he is jesus christ and he swore so sweet brother gave us that verse he says listen to this amen and when he came he's he swore ah yeah but where's that verse for six yes and he swear by him that leave it forever and ever who created the heaven and the earth and the things that are in her and the earth and the sin that they are in uh and the sea and the things that are in that this is what he was swearing this is what he was saying that no matter what happens he is swearing by himself he swear and he said there should be time no longer hallelujah now that does not mean the end of all things and the destruction of the world but it only means that time for the sealed book to remain sealed is no longer hallelujah it is time for the seven seals now to be open the time of silence is over the time of clover blind in the eyes is over paul said amen now i am a baby i see through a glass darkly but when that which is perfect is calm hallelujah let me tell you when this time arrives amen when the time is no longer it means that our eyes shall be opened that's why we sing a song and we say our eyes of understanding they have been opened up at last sweet victory is ours who were chained up in the past through jubilee has sounded and we have responded to our god who is the original life meaning when that time comes and time is no longer even the book amen will be open amen the seals will be removed and our eyes of understanding will open up at last and now we will say we are the people of the book and now we will say we are the people that prophet paul talked about and he said when that which is perfect is come we are the people who are living in a time when we are saying when that which is perfect is come now we are living in perfection of all things affection of sin perfection of of the mystery of god perfection of the true church of god perfection of the world things and perfection there is perfection everywhere the prostitutes are perfecting their skill the politicians are also perfecting their skills their denominations are perfecting their skills the pastors especially the fake ones they are perfecting their skills these men these men they can fake people and steal millions and people still go there widely because these men have perfected their skills but in the same way god is also perfecting his church hallelujah we have come to perfection we are no longer seeing through our class directly women we are now seeing affection there is that perfect church without spot and wrinkle washing the blood let me tell you that church is the church of the end time believers going in rapture that church is here hallelujah and then we see that he said i was about to write and he said i swear i said the time will be no longer and the second thing is okay which which verse are we at seven give me that seven but in the days now when it says time shall be no longer that was what he said and now if i rise by saying but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets i want to say the days of the voice you know this church has got days of the voice fellowship because of you were coming here for the first time now you will know why because the days of the voice of the seventh angel have already come and he says when the seventh angel comes when these days of the seventh angel comes of the voice of the seventh angel he says the mystery of god shall be finished the mystery of the seven thunders shall be accomplished the mystery of the seventh seal shall be accomplished the mystery of god shall be accomplished it will all be finished amen to do what to bring forth a holy ghost church without spot a wrinkle ready for the rapture hallelujah the end of time you know speaking of the time of the revealing of the mystery this is speaking of the time of the revealing of the mystery time of the opening of the book the lamb was and ease whether to take the book and lose the mystery of the seven standards you know which the mysteries contained in in the seven seals isn't it amazing hallelujah actually brother banham says here and this is very very important we read it last time but i'll read it now again now you will understand it better in in the message is this the sign of the end when i listen to this brother it stuck with me because it has this thing that it touches your heart you need to listen to this message again brethren he says time shall be no more but abandonment expressed that part time shall be what time and here he explains it he says he announces that time is over and then he says what happens he asks again what happens and then he says could that be so now this is he's speaking this in 1962 now december and he says could that time be now could that be so now what happens what happens and then he says brethren seriously think if it is the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders meaning not in the future he means at that time and then he says you remember the pyramid message and then he says it is the capstone and then he says what did he do the holy spirit kept off the individual and sell it when we add to our faith righteousness and godliness faith and so forth and kept adding to it till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is god that is how he makes the individual and cups him and seals him with the holy ghost then he says here if that be so he's got the saving if that be so he's got the seven church ages that is his heart seven mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes he brings it from an individual from now the generations the church ages seven of them and then he says now he is he's other seven mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for and bring back and now the heads don't comes to cup of the church and then he says does the sanders mean that my brethren says is that where we are they say yes sir that is where we are has come to the church hallelujah [Music] praise the name of the living god and then here i want to now try to wrap it up it says here in the book of la the location church age it says okay i already read that i will write that for you now i'll read this other one i'll read this other one this one i've always wanted to read for the past four services and i always miss it i almost missed it today let me read it today then he says the mysteries what are the mysteries you may have had some mysteries what are the mysteries which are opened the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the greater mysteries are the great mysteries i mean the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are number one very specific to show you that we are now at that time of the revealing of the mystery the book is open amen by the bananas to show you mystery one by one by one by one by one and then tell you yeah we are living in that time that's why he said is this the end amen the time of the end says is this the sign of the end yes the sign of the end of the world of the book to be closed it's the time of the opening of the book it's the time of the opening of the mystery it's the time of the revealing of jesus christ in his fullness in his people hallelujah then he says number one brother where are you he says the mystery of the kingdom of heaven that is the one we are talking on now matthew 13 3 to 50. now i wish we had time we would explain one by one but we will not be today i just read because of time we'll explain it in another service now he says here now the second mystery is the mystery of the israelites blindness during this age romans 11. those of you who want to know about the mystery of israel's blindness you can read romans 11 or you can listen to the series we have been taking on youtube it is there it's called you can write it down the gentile dispensation you will be able to hear on the on the on the youtube channel it's called days of the voice fellowship you will be able to hear many much much much about that now third the mystery is the mystery of the translation of the living saints which is me and you at the end time of this age we are going to be translated and those are the scriptures that talk about it fourth is the mystery of the new testament church as one body composed of both jews and gentiles hallelujah oh some of you maybe didn't know that we can talk about that later number number fifth says fifa mystery is of the church as the bride of christ the church is no longer just a church amen he said after the seals he said i no longer call you church i now call you right hallelujah sixth mystery is of the living christ the same yesterday and today and forever i love this one hallelujah that is one of the mysteries that has been opened in our time amen some people say healing used to be in those days no even in this day it happens also in this day miracles used to be of the past miracles still happened today people still get filled with the holy spirit not only heavy knowledge knowledge you can take it to hell even you should not only get head knowledge your faith must be the faith of the heart and the face of action amen it must make you believe if you have too much faith must make you believe the word of god you know amen that there are certain things you need to do and things you don't need to do some people think the holy ghost means you just run around the holy ghost will take you back to the world and the seventh mystery is of god even christ hallelujah as the incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom all divine wisdom and godly race is restored to man amen that what is that to the knowledge of knowing hallelujah that jesus christ is god jesus christ is oh you don't believe me do you jesus christ is [Music] he is not the second god he is not the third god he is the same god the same yesterday today and forever the god of the old testament amen the god of isaac jacob he is our god amen and the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in the second thessalonians and so forth the tenth mystery is the seven stars of the revelation 120. we we just been through that the seven stars of the seven churches the seven messengers and so forth we know that here very well and the 11th mystery is the mystery of babylon the prostitute revelation 17 5 27 that is some of the mysteries that this angel this angel this angel is supposed to wind up all the mystery the mysteries of god and the other may i say this with reverence i'm not referring to myself but where we know but referring to the end of god the serpentis seed that's been in a hidden mystery all through the ass the reason why he's saying this and he gave a disclaimer up there because you just preached on the serpent seed and everybody knew it was who wrote and broke that mystery so now he was saying i'm not referring to myself but we know we know who the seventh engine messenger is hallelujah they suffered a seed that's been a hidden mystery all through the years the grace straightened out not disgrace but real true grace no such a thing as a tunnel and burning hell some people say oh you will go to hell and burn for eternity where is that in the bible nowhere you will burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal heart hadn't never had a beginning or end and hell was created all these mysteries hallelujah praise the name of the living god i want to say the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same words that he did some people say where it is the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation so that after you will be like a dry rock and somehow you receive the holy ghost he said also in that same part but christ performing in you the same works that he did if you receive the holy ghost truly we must see the works that christ performed being in you okay now i want to finish the mystery of water baptism and if you are here and you have not been baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ oh you have been baptized but in the name of father son and holy spirit then you must hear this as i finish the mystery of water baptism where the extremitarianism has brought into in into the title of father son and holocaust and the mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of jesus christ according to the book of the revelation that the church in this time was to receive there is some of the mysteries let me tell you church baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ is a big mystery and only the believers who believe this angel according to revelation 10 7 are the ones who have received the true revelation of god the peace of fire returning back amen that's the thing that is supposed to take place and we see we see we see i told you someone on sunday saw the purifier and we see hallelujah if you can't see it say lord help me say it open my eyes that i may see hallelujah and i tell you if
