rejoicing in our hearts saying his did our hearts burn within us us we commit the service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated for just a moment amen um there uh I do not expect sister charity she's been down brother Joel and several other families but I'm happy to see those who have been able to make it this evening I know I've been following online as we were driving to church there are more online than is here this evening but I say the Lord is going to speak to us this even amen how many are expectant amen so uh I know brother team is new to many of [Music] you uh but he Vis he last visited us uh when we were still in I always call it a little shop the other side uh you've heard me say many times that uh brother Eddie bisar fathered me in in the ministry and it was through his ministry that I was able to meet with brother Tim do and uh we've come a long way with him he wedded my wife that is 11 years ago amazing and and so um also there are many things I could say but I will say this um since we returned back to Uganda from Ethiopia we've had three team um about three teams of translators instituted in the luganda language in the um uh in the language and in the language and many of you may not know but thousands of messages out of those languages are printed every month uh in our office and um actually about 12,000 messages are printed every month um brother Tim do is the missions director of Bible behind supporting that printing work I see I know there's a brother here from kja they have been beneficiaries of these messages um for example in language the message has never been translated or printed in that language we have young men here who have been volunteering to but uh brother brother Tim do is representing those brothers that have been supporting them uh with the ink all the supplies he has been one of the translators inanda languages and so we are so honored this evening because brother Tim has been a blessing to the country of Uganda in many ways and so as a church we are honored to have him here um he will be visiting other places but for now we are the beneficiaries so I want you to open your heart and expect the Lord to minister to you but the team is a teacher of the word and be expectant maybe to learn new things in the message let us stand on our feet as we shall sing A Chorus let us sing that again as we invite him I have a father can we sing I have a father he calls me his own he'll never leave me sing it now he'll never leave me no matter where I go no matter where I go oh he knows he knows my [Applause] [Music] name he knows my every thought he see still that fall and he me where oh I'm glad he know he knows my name he knows my every [Music] that amen do you love the Lord greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be gathered together on a Wednesday night Amen Let me shake this man's hand it's been a while we sure appreciate you appreciate your pastor brother basabi has been working with us for many years anytime that we've had a burden whether it be translation printing books he has jumped into the Gap to carry on the [Music] process I say God bless you abundant amen I know him to be very diligent and very um [Music] resourceful and I'm sure you love him very much I want to bring you greetings from Canada our pastor brother Tom Ray Tom Ray and the the rest of the ministry at Cloverdale Bible Way and the church over there in Canada they send their greetings and their love to the bride in [Music] Uganda our love is not measured by the amount of money we spend in Uganda it is much greater than that when we get on the other side brother Bram said what's over there it is perfect love and there's no money over there praise the Lord so love is not measured by money even if we spend money to print books to do translation to carry on the work of God that's not what love is love is when the word of God is revealed to you and that's the reason that we do all those things well I don't want to spend too much time on [Music] introductions if you have your Bibles let's turn to the book of Ephesians your pastor wanted me to come on a weekend as they did in Ethiopia South Africa and Angola and I had to make a decision I only I only had one weekend to spare and I spent it in Ethiopia so then we came here and I said if if it's okay with your people I'll give you Wednesday night is that okay with you amen amen and then I'm heading up into the interior to visit quite a number places amen now as we look in the book of Ephesians I want to speak a subject tonight we'll just see how uh how the Lord leads us um we are late because of the traffic but let's just let the Lord have his way let's bow our heads and ask him Heavenly Father we're gathered together on this Wednesday even because we love you we love your word we need your revelation we want to meet with you tonight and Lord we didn't come to hear a man we want you to have the preeminent we want you to take complete control because you are the word that discerns every heart there is no secret that is hidden from you you know everyone individually there is no great one or little one amongst us but Lord you are the great one and we are the Sheep of your pastor so have your way this evening send your word to the hearts of your children for man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God we commit ourselves to you bless the speaker and the hearer Jesus Christ amen and may God visit those that are listening online amen Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus all right so he's writing to those in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus put your name there he's writing to you Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love when did he choose you was it when you prayed was it when you got baptized no before the foundation of the world and that's why he sent this message to you cuz he chose you amen next verse having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the [Music] Beloved Lord add his Blessing to the word you may have now many things jump out at us here in the scripture and you'll notice verse four it says he chose us for the foundation of the world and verse five says predestinated us unto the adoption of children now that's the same thought that he he wrote in chapter eight of Romans those who he forew forew before the foundation of the who he fornew he predestinated to what it says here to adoption in Romans it says to be conformed to the image of his son so he predestinated you to sunship moreover whom he predestinated he called are you with me and whom he called he justified and whom he justified he has glorified and then the scripture in Romans 8 says what sh shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us amen did he choose you before the foundation of the world if God before you who can be against you and and verse six says to the praise of the glory of his [Music] grace I want to speak about the glory of his grace Glory when we talk about Glory what do we think about you know the Bible says Solomon in his glory you know Jesus spoke about Solomon and in Matthew 6 he said consider the lies of the field he says but even Solomon in all of his glory is not AR raay like one of the beauty of the lies he says they don't toil they don't struggle they just rest in the provision of God but they have more Glory than Solon see sometimes we like to struggle we like to labor rather than rest in what God has called us to be all of the glory Belongs to the Lord we know that no flesh will glory in his presence and even he commanded us when we pray he says Le When you pray say lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory amen who is the kingdom it's his who is the power it's his and whose is the glory it's his if there be anything good accomplished in our lives if there be anything good accomplished in Uganda if there be anything good accomplished in this church it's all to the glory of God we have nothing but what he has given us without him we are nothing and if he takes his hand off of us we would fall in a moment even brother brother Bram said that if he took his hand off of us he we would just fall you know John describes him in John chapter 1 he says the word was made [Music] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory now the Bible says there was no Beauty in him that we should desire so the glory was not in Beauty but character the power of God says we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the glory of his grace amen what is Glory Glory isn't winning the World Cup I know Uganda likes uh what do you call it here football what do they call them the stars or something is that what it's called what do they call it what's the name of your your national team Uganda CR what Uganda CR okay Uganda CR all right now if they were to win the World Cup the country would be dancing in the streets come on you don't tell me you young men don't know what I'm talking about they be all rejoicing oh to the glory the soccer or the football players all the country would have a parade they would be so happy come on don't be over spiritual but that's not the glory we're talking about we're talking about the glory of the grace of [Applause] God and you are sitting here this evening in the glory of his grace you have been chosen to the glory of his grace his grace is to be glorified I'm not here because of my efforts you're not here because of your efforts you are not saved through your repentance you are saved through faith faith is a revelation from God and Christ revealed himself to you according to the glory of his grace he came to you he the Mighty God revealed himself to you he did not come down from heaven in great shining Roes but John describes him the word in the beginning was the and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory his glory was revealed to us the world couldn't see his glory the Pharisees couldn't see his glory pilate couldn't see his glory but we see his glory his glory is that he came to you that's the glory of his grace you were nobody you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity you come into this world speaking life you had nothing to offer him but he came to you Amen to the glory of his gra you're not adding to him he's adding to you he redeemed you he has clothed you with his word not to make himself any greater he's infinite he's Eternal it's to the glory of his grace you know the devil had ideas Lucifer in heaven he had ideas of what God's glory Rec constituted brother Brown says it this way message God of this evil age he thought God dwell in worldly Beauty he did that in Heaven Sin never begin in the Garden of Eden it began in heaven when Lucifer Luci the son of the morning exalted himself in Beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of Michel he thought that God dwell in Beauty see he thought that's where the glory was see Lucifer started a fight he thought there was glory in Conquest he tried to conquer Michael and the angels that remain steadfast he thought a battle was needed to settle the issue to him God dwelt in Beauty not in the humility that Michael expressed and there was a fight and he thought he could conquer you see he could not see any glory in humbling himself to him glory belonged in the preeminent position he had a wrong idea of God's glory he thought to be like God isn't that what Isaiah says about him he says I will sit on the sides of the North I will be worshiped like God he had a great ambition he wanted to be glorified he wanted to be lifted up but he couldn't see that the God the Eternal God Of Heaven could humble himself and make for himself a body to be born of a virgin laying in a Manger and we beheld his glory the glory of the Eternal God the word became James chapter 4 says 4 and verse 6 James and it says but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resist the proud but giveth Grace unto the submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded Afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourself the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up see that's the opposite of what Lucifer thought he said I will Ascend I will exalt myself I will sit upon the mountain I will be like the most high he exalted himself and he became humble and the script says humble yourself and God will lift you up amen Lucifer had the direct opposite why am I talking about Lucifer in the glory of God's grace I want you to understand that Lucifer did not understand [Music] Grace matter of fact he could not see grace even though he was going to be instrumental in the expression of God's grace see no angel can understand God's grace when we get to the marriage supper of the Lamb I think we'll all sing together Amazing Grace that saved a wetch when we sing that song brother Braham says the angels will bow their heads because they won't know what we're singing about right because the Angels don't know grace to the angels that stayed true they they didn't need grace to the angels that fell did not receive Grace see angels are ministering Spirits they're not Sons Sons are the recipient of Grace pred Grace is predestinated unmerited favor but and to God's Sons to his attributes there is Grace in the fall in the Garden of Eden we realize that there the world saw Grace for the first time when Adam and Eve sin God by Grace provided a sacrifice to come back into fellowship with them why because they had predestinated unmerited favor they were a thought in the mind of God God had chosen them before the foundation of world there was a provided way for them through Grace that's why it comes to you that way no matter where you came from no matter what happens in your life if you're a Son of God a thought of God before the foundation by Grace you are saved and that by faith not of yourselves it is the gift of God hallelujah he came to me he found me I didn't find him I didn't do anything to deserve him came by my way so it's all to the glory of his grace sometimes we we feel like we we deserve credit from [Music] God like Paul in 2 Corinthians 11 turn to it he says if I need to Glory I will glory in the things which concern my infirmities you see he says I will not glory in myself but in my infirmities now listen Paul is like many of us he says I besought the Lord Thrice take this from me Paul was a Believer he was a prophet he was full of the Holy Ghost he was the Apostle of the Gentiles he was the messenger the first age he was the example messenger he the example preacher Paul says I besought the Lord take this away from me God I Believe You're My Healer amen here's a prophet God You're My Healer my eyes bring me a Deliverance I'm going to overcome this thing I will be victorious I besought the Lord three times he said take it away from me but he said unto me my grace is sufficient for for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmity that the power of Christ May rest upon me hallelujah hallelujah the dimension that we live in time matter light was made to manifest God's grace it's different than eternity there's no Grace in heaven this is the dimension of Grace while there's no Grace in heaven Grace come from God himself to his sons his attributes expressed in their season in this Dimension so now in heaven there's no Grace this is the realm of Grace so let me ask you a question which would you rather be a perfect angel in heaven or a son of God or a son of God with all your imperfection which would you rather be you want to be an angel see sometimes on this this Earth we want to be an angel maybe I'll turn this way and pre just I'm getting just as much response which would you rather be put your name there you're an attribute of God from Mind Of God before the foundation of the world and in the mind of God for you in this realm is predestinated unmerited Grace amen give me the grace of God rather than the Perfection of an Angel let me say it again give me the grace of God rather than the Perfection of an the Apostle Paul wanted his eyes to be but God said my grace is sufficient for you give me the the grace of God give me all of his grace I want to glorify his grace that's why Paul says I will glory in my infirm Hallelujah he was caught up into heaven he saw the angels He Saw things he wasn't even allowed to speak but yet in the midst of all that says if I Glory I won't Glory about that I'll glory in my weakness hallelujah hallelujah that God's strength might rest upon now in the church age book The the message to the lateran age are you in that age you were born in that age you're called into a bride age but you were born in Le all right and it says unto the angel of the Church of the Le these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God oh if I could I could preach on that last statement for the next three hours the beginning of the creation of God but brother Bram takes it in the church age book Jesus is giving us this description of himself in relationship to the last age the days of grace are winding up Grace is coming to an end when the last member of the Bride Comes in these mortal bodies will be changed they'll become immortal we'll be United with our heavenly bodies and then there's no more need for Grace he says he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th century and has told us things concerning the ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age you know the characteristics I am rich increase with that's this age he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself that's his message to the lastage a final look at Grace a full revelation of Grace and supreme deity or if I can say it this way the grace and the sovereignty of [Music] God he will not lose one he chose you it's his choosing it's not our choosing it's his Cho he will ensure that you make it blessed is the man to whom God will not impute iniquity God has a plan of redemption in his thoughts and remember this Plan of Redemption is to the glory of his grace he chose you he predestinated you to sunship to the glory of his are you with me unseen By Angels manifested in Son of God sons of God Amen Let me let me take you a little bit further here I'm going to try and hold restrain myself here tonight I know what it's like in Africa you all have to make your way home in the dark so let's just focus ourselves stay with me I'm going to shift gears I'm going to move into a higher gear all right so let's let's go Ephesus Church AG there were two trees in the Garden of Eden both of these trees had a relationship to man or they never would have been placed there they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God or we could never impute omniscience to God in other words God put two trees in the garden a purpose amen he says that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than the way of God manifested In the Flesh all right I'm getting ahead of myself here but this is on page 102 of the church age book you read it when you go home brother Bram takes the scripture that we read in Ephesians and then he takes Revelation 133 and he says all on the Earth shall worship Satan whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world then he says that life what life the life of the Lamb could not be shared any other way that God manifested in flesh that was part of his eternal and predestinated purpose then he says this plan is to the praise of the glory of his [Music] grace it's a Plan of Redemption it's a Plan of Salvation and then he then he says right in the book he says now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man predestinate a man to that would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being let me let me sum it up for you you needing salvation is the purpose of his being Hallelujah he says thus what God worked out here in the garden was his pred destinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden then there would come a day when God would appear in the flesh and by means of his [Music] humiliation see that's what the devil couldn't understand he thought the way to overcome was to conquer battle fight that's why a church fight is never to the glory of are you with me but the devil thought that but he couldn't understand that but brother Ram says God would appear in the flesh and by means of his humiliation the most humiliating death treated in the most humiliating Way by means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal hallelujah hallelujah we we say that he's a savior and there therefore something needed to be saved but let me put it to you another way you couldn't even be lost if he wasn't a savior let me me say it again you couldn't even be lost if he wasn't a sa the reason you were lost is because he's a savior and that gives him purpose of being to the glory of his grace so let me take it further you couldn't even be sick unless he was a Healer hey [Music] Glory now now we want to shout that's why Paul said I will glory in my infirmity it's to the glory of his grace so next time you're sick or those of you that are homesick tonight your your pastor spent a good part of the day in bed today because he was sick but let me just say that when you're laying there sick you just say Lord this is because you're a Healer Hallelujah that's the true revelation of the word of God to the glory of his grace amen amen the first time Grace was expressed as I said was in the Garden of Eden in Eden God's attributes had to come to their full expression it might seem like Creation in its Perfection the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve communicating with the animals an amateur God on the earth that might seem like that's glorious but there was a hidden Glory that was not yet expressed the Redemptive purpose of God to the glory of his grace hallelujah hallelujah God had laid the plan out and when Satan accomplished what God wanted him to bring about the fall because only through the fall could God Express his grace Hallelujah Abel had a revelation of that he had a greater Revelation than Cain did it was to the glory of the grace of God it wasn't fig leaves it wasn't man's effort see Cain thought he could worship God by [Music] effort a beautiful altar a beautiful Church a beautiful form of worship but Abel knew it's his grace a god provided a blood sacrifice by and Abel worshiped God by the Revelation to the glory of his [Music] grace man Liv then for 2,000 years and then they arrive at the time of Noah and it it uh repented the Lord that he made man on the Earth it grieved him at his [Music] heart and God said he would destroy the Earth we've come to just before another destruction I'm not a political man but they just had an election in the United States I thought if that woman gets elected we're headed to World War I but it seems like God's will was that Trump would get elected so maybe he spared us a little bit more time why there's more work to be done there's more seed to come in there's more bride to be mature it's not about politics it's about God's Redemptive purpose there's more grace to be poured out and Noah when he lived in his day the time finally came for Destruction but Noah found Grace in the eyes of Lord hallelujah hallelujah when is we living this last day when the world is heading into a tribulation I don't want works I don't want to present anything I've done I just want to find Grace in it was Grace of God that provided the ark Noah that preacher of righteousness he preached the flood he preached destruction he preached rain but the same Reign that destroyed the world saved eight Souls amen the Bible says that in First Peter 3 eight Souls were saved by water it was the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah brother bradam says every time the messengers went forth brought a message of Love Grace and deliverance God's message has always been a message of Deliverance before judgment this message to the last days is rapturing Faith what is that Deliverance Before Destruction there's coming a destruction on the Earth but God sends a message to build you up into rapturing faith that will be caught up together with the resurrected Saints to meet the Lord in the air he says Noah had a deliver had Deliverance lot had Deliverance though it was a message of Deliverance people turn it down it's mercy and deliverance and people turn it down you know don't turn down this message this is the final message to the final age I don't know if somebody tonight is hearing this message for the first time we're coming to the finishing the final time of God's grace don't turn down God's grace it's God's grace that he sent us a message of Deliverance like Abraham in the city of Earth who is Abraham nobody just a normal doing a normal job but God sent a message of Grace to and by faith we are the children of Abraham his life was a story of Grace God chose him to the glory of his grace God spared Sarah to the glory of his God had a plan Sarah will have a son and Abraham was ready to to give her up imagine sisters if you had a husband like Abraham the King was interested in his wife so what's Abraham's response I'll fight to my death no he said just say you're my sister I don't think there's any sister wants a husband like that amen sisters he wouldn't even protect her what kind of a man was he he was God's chosen man the glory of Abraham but to the glory of God's Gra hallelujah hallelujah Grace sent Israel a deliverer Grace provided them a prophet when they needed a Deliverance God sent them Moses it was his grace he didn't ask them to figure out how to get delivered Propet he said a deliverer God didn't ask you to figure out the Rapture he sent you a prophet he sent a deliverer God sent Israel a rock when they needed water God sent them Mana when they needed food by Grace but still they wanted a law where there's no Grace in the law the law brings you into captivity but Grace sets you free why would people choose a la choose God's grace why would people choose dos and don'ts in the message exctly that's exactly the way you say it do this don't do that when God is offering you his you want to know how to get free of the world get more of Christ get more of his gra more of him in you less of the world because he has chosen you to the glory of his grace he chose you not to the glory of your efforts not to the glory of your pastor not to the glory of your church but to the glory of his grace Hallelujah Grace provided us a savior to redeem the attributes of God he paid the price 2,000 years ago and ascended to his father's throne and then when John saw him in Revelation 5 he was called The Lion of the tribe of Judah the ruler the King the lion of the tribe of Judah and John says I turned to see the lion and I saw the grace of God I saw a lamb as it had been SL he is the lion is the ruler he's come forth in our day with the book open to bring you back to your right but what do you see do you see a lion or do you see a lamb John saw a lamb as it had been lamb took the book The Lamb Loos the seals the lamb brought us back to our in to the glory of his grace no wonder John fell down and worshiped the lamb and the elders fell down and worshiped the lamb and the four beasts fell down think about it the four beasts fell down and worshiped the lamb not the lion the lamb hallelujah hallelujah they rejoice and they they they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seat all right I'm going I'm going in seven different directions here we go why did John Rejoice because it was the opposite of the reason that he cried I didn't get it it was the opposite of the reason that he cried wept because no man in earth or under the Earth or in heaven was found worthy brother Brown said why did he weep his name was on that book your name was on that book if it remained sealed Redemption couldn't be finished if it remained sealed you'd never know who you were there had to be a revelation of what's on the book what's on the book the sons of God the attributes of God chosen before the foundation of the world to the glory of his grace now Romans 8 says that all of creation even this creation groans waiting for the King James says manifestation of the sons of God but the word manifestation isn't actually manifestation because it's in the Greek [Music] apocalypsis in Revelation 1 and one says the revelation of Jesus Christ the apocalypsis of Jesus Christ so the revelation of the sons or the manifestation of the son is actually the revelation of the sons so then what is the revelation of the sons where is the mystery of the sons of God it's on the Lamb's Book of Life when is it revealed in this day all of creation has been groaning for this message Hallelujah this is the revelation of the sons of God Revelation one says the revelation of Jesus Christ stay with me whom he did predestinate he whom he forew he did predestinate all right whose name was on the book what book you mean God has a book in heaven how many pages does it have what's it made out of is it paper is it parchment is it lamb skin what's it made out of no book is a symbol Book of Revelation is a book is a book of symbol so what is written on the book the attributes of God not just a minute where are the attributes of God they're in the thoughts of God so the thoughts of God were sealed up the thoughts of God were sealed with Seven Seals but the lamb paid the price to unseal the thoughts of God that the thoughts of God the attributes of God you and I could be revealed because whom he fornew those in the book those in his thoughts he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son but what is the image of his son it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and that Revelation is here seals are off the book to reveal who you always were because you got to come to the revelation of Who You Are are it's got to be revealed to you personally so God opened the book to the glory of his grace that you might see yourself that you might see yourself the way that God sees you not the way the devil sees you the devil says you're a nobody the devil says you're you make too many mistakes the devil says you got all kinds of troubles the devil says there that there's nothing good about just like he did about Job God said Satan have you considered my servant job and the devil says take your hand off him I'll make him curse you but God saw job for what he was God sees you for what you are the trials he sends you the things that you go through is to prove his thinking about you correct thinking Hallelujah those who he [Applause] forew he knew you before and God's thoughts cannot change his thoughts are Eternal it always were and he has his Perfect Bride without spot or wrinkle orish or any such thing are you that bride if you're that bride now you always were that briide and you always will be that and nothing the devil can do can stop it so God sends his message to wash you in the water of the world you always were a perfect brde sends his message to wash your thoughts and let put in you the thoughts of God hallelujah [Applause] amen it's Grace oh let me just go a step further are we okay says to the praise of the glory of his grace then it says wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved but beloved is not actually the right word in English all right it's it's a form of Agape all right there's three forms of agap love love projected and the recipient of the love all right but but this word is not agapetos which is actually this word is AAP love projected all right so he has made us accepted in the projected love [Music] but now go step further and say accepted is not the right word this is amazing because the words what they meant when they were translated mean different things today if we did a literal translation that would this word accepted would be graced all right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has graced you with projected love what is Grace predestinated unmerited favor now here it is man's thinking denominational thinking is if you believe you will be accepted but the truth of the word of God is you are already accept Hallelujah and therefore you believe hallelujah amen hallelujah wherein he has made his acceptance hallelujah amen brother Bram says you're going to the wedding in the sky you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation so he slipped the wedding band on you there not here before the foundation of the world brother Adam says a wedding band represents something it's it's round and it has no ending because it represents eternity an eternal Union and this is the message invisible Union slip the wedding band on you before the foundation of the world then he says he put your name on the book The Wedding Band of predestinated unmerited [Music] Grace so then when the book is open it's to the glory of his grace hallelujah hallelujah I'll bring you one more quote and then we'll close from this is out of the paman church age from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin to his word she's a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be the fulfilled all that was promised by God to be manifested in the virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be manifested God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word in the Virgin it was an angel that brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God all right then he goes on I skip a little bit he goes on here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ sometimes we just think that's Doctrine no it's God's thinking of you you are that virgin if you know if you're a virgin it means you're not tied up with man's Creeds and [Music] dogas you've been brought to the perfect word and you believed it showing you where the virgin the one with the ring on your finger a predestinated unmar Grace and that word being revealed to you shows you who you are and that eliminates Creeds and dogmas it does a away with man's thinking it does a away with the devil's thinking cuz the devil thought he could cause job to stumble the devil doesn't believe you're the bride but God knows you're the bride because he sent his word that can only be received by the bride the word is in the bride as it was in Mary Mary said it unto me according to Thy word not my will but thy will be done that sunship that's what Jesus prayed in the garden Mary didn't ask for the for the word or the manifestation of the word in her ideas could you just wait till Joseph and I are married could it just come at a different season no the word came to her and she said be it unto me according to your word she didn't know how she didn't understand the mechanics of it but she met an angel God said his Angel to you with a message a Vindicated Prophet to tell you what God thinks about you I say be it unto me according to Thy word all right last quote when God made the first man he made the heavens and the Earth and God St back stood back on the old creation and looked upon it he didn't look upon it to judge it he looked upon it and said how good it is he admired it all right that was the first creation he says but now Satan perverted that but if God could not condemn his first creation how much more is it impossible to condemn his second creation when you are created a new in Christ Jesus what's the message to the latest in age this is from he the beginning of the creation of God you are the creation of God in Bride form amen when you are created a new in Christ Jesus you can't do it yourself no matter how much you want to you can't do it it's a gift of God no man can come to me except my father draws and all that comes to me I'll give him everlasting [Music] life and raise him up at the last day now listen when God has borne you a new by the Holy Spirit that's the new creation so now here's what he says he can only look upon you as a perfect work am because he did it himself amen that's why religion with works the law of D ands all of those man-made dogmas and Creeds will never be considered a perfect work adding something to the New Birth when God gives you the New Birth by the Holy Spirit he can only look upon you as a perfect word because he did it himself he can't condemn you that ought to make you jump he can't condemn you are his workmanship cuz then brother brandham said I feel like shouting like a Methodist Hallelujah think of it you are God's workmanship he did it by how Sovereign Grace not because you jumped not because you went to church not because you turned a new page but because God in his Mercy brought you into Christ and to fellowship and looks upon you as a perfect work of his own you are God's [Music] workmanship so let me say in closing quit believing the devil's Lies when God looks at you he sees the blood and the blood is perfect and because you are identified in the blood you are perfect he never looks upon you to condemn you there is no condemnation to them who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh the flesh will remind you of your mistakes but the spirit of God says you're my child you are created perfect in Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah oh how it makes us want to shout like a Methodist or like a message believer rejoice when John saw the lamb take the book because if the lamb didn't take the book John could never know who he really was but when the lamb took the book seals John Rejoice Elders Rejoice before anointings rejoice and we Rejoice because the book is open and we can see through the revelation of God we are in God's so whom he did predestinate he called whom he called he justified whom he justified he glorified what shall we then say to these things say it with me if God before us who can be against us hallelujah am I am persuaded that neither height nor depth principality not things present not things to come not things in this world or anywhere else nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jes hallelujah hallelujah do you believe him do you believe if you believe him stand to your faith if you believe him stand to your tell God I reject the devil's life I accept what you say about me be it unto me according to Thy word I doubt my doubts Hallelujah I put aside every man made it's not what your your culture tells you not what your education tells you family genetics tells you what the open book you're the predestinated Virgin bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you have a right to every promise Heavenly Father we bow in your presence we say be it unto us Accord if we're sick tonight be it unto us according to your word if there's anybody in fear tonight we reject it be it unto us according to your word we reject every lie of the devil be it unto us according to your word we embrace your word we let everything behind us fall aside we lay a hold on every promise according to the faith that you have deposited within us we
