[9:58] shortly
[9:59] amen how many I happy to be in the house
[10:03] of oh brother I'm happy to
[10:06] see God bless
[10:08] you amen sister Angela I'm always happy
[10:10] to see
[10:12] you and you know each and every one of
[10:16] you you know we just love you with all
[10:18] our
[10:19] hearts and know Sister Esther is
[10:22] treating a father in the
[10:25] hospital she has not failed to come to
[10:28] service
[10:30] she has not failed to uh come for the
[10:33] preparations for the
[10:35] meetings I'm deeply touched by
[10:40] that and sister because of
[10:44] that I'd like us to pray for your father
[10:47] right
[10:49] now our father is in the
[10:51] hospital and he's been there for a few
[10:54] days I spoke to him
[10:56] today and uh is's in
[11:00] pain and we need to pray that God will
[11:03] heal
[11:04] him you know it is good for us to cross
[11:08] over into the other
[11:11] life or to or to
[11:14] leave to us there's no
[11:17] difference but pain is not our
[11:20] portion suffering is not our
[11:23] portion and so let us pray that God will
[11:26] heal him out of
[11:27] it
[11:30] believe the Bible says if two shall
[11:32] agree as touching anything will be given
[11:36] to
[11:37] them so before we go to the word why
[11:39] don't we bow our
[11:41] heads
[11:43] remember loveing Jesus I've been so

[14:27] amen amen
[14:29] amen praise the
[14:31] Lord amen after the service
[14:35] tonight I'm going to the
[14:38] airport to pick our first
[14:42] guests
[14:44] amen I've hosted many
[14:49] people uh throughout my life and time in
[14:54] Ministry in Ethiopia and also here in
[14:57] Uganda ug but I've not seen
[15:01] anyone that the devil has fought with a
[15:06] magnitude like he has fought by
[15:09] timoth the devil has prevented him to
[15:13] come from the moment it was declared
[15:15] that he was
[15:17] coming and until
[15:19] recently his motherin-law took
[15:22] sick she was taken to the
[15:25] hospital I was in Kenya at the time in
[15:27] the meetings
[15:29] I spoke to the Believers and told them
[15:30] what was
[15:32] happening and we agreed together and
[15:35] prayed and uh she started
[15:37] improving and was removed from the
[15:40] hospital and uh and uh then then also
[15:43] his
[15:44] wife you know had some
[15:47] conditions and so he asked me to pray
[15:51] and he told me that if his mother-in-law
[15:52] in the you know would not be fine then
[15:55] he would not be able to
[15:57] travel
[15:59] and so I said we are believing that God
[16:01] will heal
[16:02] her and so she came out of the
[16:05] hospital and so he took the he took the
[16:08] trip and uh yesterday in Europe in
[16:14] Geneva texted me and and told
[16:18] me that there was he actually sent me a
[16:22] picture there was a huge
[16:25] storm and I asked him is it not
[16:27] dangerous
[16:29] he said he doesn't know so that means it
[16:32] had the potential of being dangerous
[16:36] to you remember Jesus before he
[16:38] delivered that man who was in the tombs
[16:40] of
[16:43] gadara you remember what happened a
[16:47] storm and so we see thatth when the
[16:50] devil raises a
[16:52] storm someone is getting ready to be
[16:55] delivered and so I I I we pray PR I was
[16:59] at home when he sent me that I was with
[17:02] brother Henry and brother martin so we
[17:06] were in the compound
[17:08] discussing that was last night right so
[17:11] we held hands and prayed and so he was
[17:14] able to get
[17:16] home and God calmed the
[17:18] storm and now he's telling me that his
[17:21] motherinlaw has been taken back to the
[17:25] hospital and the devil is trying his
[17:27] best to stop him to
[17:30] but I told the devil you are too
[17:32] late whatever you are
[17:34] hindering is not going to happen
[17:37] whatever you are
[17:38] hindering God cannot allow you to
[17:41] make praise the name of the Lord and so
[17:45] I heard him say he was on the flight to
[17:49] come that was the last message I heard
[17:51] from
[17:52] him and so tomorrow
[17:55] tonight after the service I'm receiving
[18:00] him and Brother

[25:59] grace that is in Christ Jesus and the
[26:01] things that thou Hast heard of me among
[26:04] many witnesses the same commit thou to
[26:07] Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach
[26:11] others also thou there endure hardness
[26:14] as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man
[26:18] that Warth Warth and Tangle himself with
[26:22] the Affairs of this life that he may
[26:25] please him who has chosen him to be a
[26:44] [Music]
[26:56] soldier
[27:08] [Music]
[27:13] you may be seated please I'm happy to
[27:16] see you brother
[27:18] Baka I'm always happy to see you in
[27:21] church when I single out several
[27:25] people sometimes it is because I was
[27:27] thinking of them or praying for
[27:30] them so when I see them I'm
[27:33] happy so when I see you I'm
[27:35] happy
[27:37] hallelujah praise God and uh I like I
[27:42] told you I've been feeling like an
[27:46] evangelist today I had to call out was
[27:48] it today yesterday I had to call out my
[27:51] daughter and I was evangelizing to her
[27:56] seriously things that uh this fire that
[28:00] is within my
[28:02] heart about what I believe that God
[28:05] desires for us as a
[28:10] generation and uh things that I believe
[28:14] that God wants us to
[28:17] do God wants a
[28:20] generation which will fear
[28:22] Him a generation that is going to
[28:26] desire after
[28:31] Holiness what generation will that
[28:35] be are people that will desire
[28:38] Holiness
[28:40] righteous Desiring to please God and not
[28:45] men did you know without
[28:49] Holiness you cannot see
[28:52] God God is Holy and he wants all of us
[28:56] to be holy
[28:58] and so this evening I'm sharing on
[29:00] entangling in the Affairs of this
[29:07] life and Paul writes to
[29:11] Timothy and he says Timothy my
[29:14] son be strong in the grace that is in
[29:16] Christ
[29:18] Jesus and the things that you have heard
[29:21] of me among many
[29:25] witnesses you know Paul had an Apostolic
[29:28] Grace upon
[29:30] him and there is something quite similar
[29:34] among all or most of the uh people who
[29:39] have the apostolic mantle upon
[29:46] them that they always want to be
[29:49] followed they always want to be
[29:51] heard because what they have is usually
[29:54] some kind of dispensational teaching
[30:00] that can revolutionize someone's
[30:04] life and fully and perfectly
[30:09] changing into uh some uh into something
[30:14] else and myself I fed from a
[30:19] Ministry that I believe was some kind of
[30:23] apostolic
[30:25] Ministry and I've never said on pulit
[30:29] before but brother Eddie
[30:31] bisc mentored
[30:33] me you know I had many things from
[30:37] him you know in text
[30:39] messages on emails and uh never would
[30:43] discuss and
[30:45] talk and sometimes he I don't know but
[30:48] whatever he wrote to
[30:50] me he he it really I I should say
[30:53] changed my
[30:56] life under that
[30:58] Ministry and watch service after
[31:02] service and I can see my life right
[31:06] now completely
[31:09] changed my my my my aspirations in life
[31:13] Chang my ambitions and
[31:17] plans and we see here brother
[31:22] Paul also is talking to
[31:25] Timothy and he say you have heard me
[31:28] speak
[31:30] things and I would want to you also to
[31:33] commit these things which you have heard
[31:34] me teach to Faithful
[31:40] Men shall also teach
[31:44] others and he says you should therefore
[31:47] endure
[31:51] hardness
[31:55] hardness and as a good
[31:59] of Jesus Christ and now here is where I
[32:02] took my title out of
[32:05] verse he says no man Warth entang no man
[32:10] that worth entangleth himself with
[32:13] Affairs of this
[32:18] life that he may please him who has
[32:21] chosen him to be a
[32:25] soldier now when a is a
[32:29] soldier we have one in the
[32:31] church and you know that a
[32:34] soldier is someone that lives a
[32:37] dedicated
[32:39] life a soldier dedicates his life to a
[32:44] cause and without you know pursuing
[32:49] anything
[32:51] else he intentionally closes his
[32:56] mind to other
[32:59] things that are contrary to the
[33:03] cause many many times are not even
[33:05] allowed to get
[33:08] married they discouraged from
[33:10] that others they discouraged from many
[33:13] things and when they training them they
[33:17] train them to follow
[33:20] instruction they follow them they they
[33:22] train them to
[33:23] obey they train them to submit
[33:27] [Music]
[33:28] to their
[33:30] Authority and when they when they passed
[33:33] the
[33:33] [Music]
[33:35] tests then now they are
[33:37] graduated and now they positioned in a
[33:41] place it is not
[33:43] easy at the beginning of the year you
[33:45] had a brother omet giving a
[33:48] testimony on how it was difficult and
[33:51] how many others
[33:54] died in the course which they had
[33:56] embarked on
[33:58] and I want to say this friends we are
[34:01] also
[34:02] soldiers and we have been
[34:05] enlisted on the greatest army in the
[34:08] world right now people think the
[34:10] greatest army in the world is the US
[34:15] Army but I want to say the greatest army
[34:17] in the
[34:18] world is the army of the
[34:22] Lord people that God has
[34:25] recruited people has called
[34:28] out and he did not call out anybody and
[34:32] everybody he called specific
[34:38] people you know when they enlisting
[34:42] soldiers they have they have qualities
[34:44] they look
[34:46] at they cannot St someone who is very
[34:51] short they cannot take someone who does
[34:54] who does not have a good
[34:55] weight
[34:57] because they may die the chances of
[35:01] death in training are
[35:03] high so they have to look at you whether
[35:07] you are
[35:09] fit that is even before
[35:12] training and then when they enlist
[35:15] you then that means you are almost
[35:19] fit but then many
[35:23] die because the ones that enlist them
[35:27] are not
[35:28] sure about who they have
[35:31] chosen but now in our army the one that
[35:35] enls
[35:37] Us by calling us is sure about everybody
[35:41] that he
[35:41] [Music]
[35:43] calls sister P he
[35:46] knows amen that when he chooses you you
[35:49] are going to amen go through the
[35:53] training however hard it is that's why
[35:57] he told him endure
[36:01] hardness however hard your training
[36:04] is however heard what you're going
[36:06] through is he says endure it endure it
[36:12] because you are a soldier and you are
[36:14] chosen to be a soldier and we are not
[36:17] chosen to be
[36:18] defeated we are chosen to
[36:21] fight and when we fight we must win the
[36:25] battle listen the battle we have our
[36:28] great
[36:30] enemy our greatest
[36:32] enemy is sin which is death which is the
[36:38] devil that is our great enemy and we
[36:41] here on Earth to
[36:43] war against our enemy to fight our enemy
[36:49] to overcome our enemy but is also an
[36:52] enemy that has been
[36:55] experienced for a long
[36:58] time he's not an
[37:00] amateur he knows what he's
[37:03] doing sat has fought for a long
[37:07] time the Devils we are
[37:09] fighting they the same one that fought
[37:12] against
[37:13] Adam they fought against Eve they are
[37:17] the ones that even fought against
[37:22] Moses same
[37:24] Devils until the man of
[37:27] said may God rebuke
[37:30] you to those
[37:33] Devils some devils that Josh fought
[37:36] against same Devils that even our lord
[37:40] Jesus fought against they are not new
[37:44] demons same demons same Devils that
[37:48] brother fought
[37:50] against come and demons out of
[37:54] people and when he goes to his room
[37:56] hotel
[37:57] room they would be waiting for
[38:01] him to torment him some
[38:04] Demon we are not fting new
[38:11] demons it is a demon it is not a new
[38:16] demon it has been here for ages but let
[38:19] me tell you same same demon have been
[38:23] defeated hallelu many many times
[38:27] many many
[38:28] times Hallelujah and if they were
[38:31] defeated
[38:32] before defeated
[38:35] again and I believe I am one of those
[38:39] that is born here on Earth to bring all
[38:42] hell to that these demons we are talking
[38:48] about there are people listen listen
[38:52] what I'm saying whether you feel it or
[38:55] you don't feel it
[38:57] it is the
[38:58] truth there are some people who are born
[39:02] on the Earth that were meant to be
[39:05] enlisted on this
[39:08] Army and all these people were born
[39:12] under that
[39:14] sign that they must
[39:17] defeat all hell they must defeat all
[39:22] demon they must defeat all sin must
[39:27] defeat death Temptation they must defeat
[39:32] last they must defeat whatever demons it
[39:36] is even
[39:38] sickness did you know sickness are
[39:43] demons there are people who are born
[39:47] that were never going to be overcome by
[39:54] deathu hallelujah amen
[39:57] people who can never
[39:59] die why because they have died
[40:03] already the moment they received Jesus
[40:07] Christ they were dead therefore they
[40:10] cannot die
[40:17] again that's why
[40:20] sh and he
[40:22] said where is your
[40:24] victory victory no
[40:27] death to a Believer who has been
[40:31] enlisted on this Army he is a soldier
[40:35] and he's a warrior and he's a
[40:38] defeater of demons he's a devil
[40:44] stomper I am one of them if you're one
[40:47] of them you can say I am one
[40:49] of I am one of them even if you're
[40:53] feeling like you are
[40:55] defeated amen you believe in thus sayth
[40:58] the
[40:59] Lord that I am one of
[41:03] them you
[41:05] know when when when soldiers are going
[41:07] to
[41:08] fight usually a captain comes
[41:11] up and he begins charging
[41:16] them speaking words speaking words and
[41:20] even the ones who are feeling like they
[41:22] defeated they begin to say no no we are
[41:25] going to consume our eny
[41:27] that's why we come for a
[41:29] preaching we are an army of
[41:33] soldiers and a preacher comes to
[41:36] motivate us to remind us who we are to
[41:39] tell us brother we are going to overcome
[41:41] our
[41:44] eny don't don't be overcome don't be
[41:48] fearful don't shy away don't hide your
[41:51] face stand straight and look in the face
[41:55] of your enemy
[41:57] stand straight and look in the face of
[41:59] your
[42:00] Temptation and tell him devil I am here
[42:04] I am born to defeat you I am born to
[42:08] defeat I am born to overcome you I am
[42:11] born to be a
[42:12] con because he that is a
[42:15] conqueror is in me and if me there is
[42:19] more than all the demons put
[42:21] [Music]
[42:23] together and the Bible here says endure
[42:26] sadness endure hardness
[42:31] rather as a good soldier of Jesus
[42:34] Christ Hallelujah
[42:37] soldiers amen
[42:38] soldiers soldiers always
[42:43] answer Hallelujah when they told to say
[42:47] they
[42:48] [Music]
[42:50] say hallelujah amen
[42:53] soldiers We Are Soldiers of Jesus
[42:57] oh
[42:58] love we are in a
[43:03] b we have to
[43:06] over whatever the devil will do let him
[43:10] be there
[43:11] and we must overcome this
[43:15] battle no man
[43:18] wor and tle himself with the Affairs of
[43:21] this
[43:23] life that's what I'm talking about today
[43:27] if God permits me entangling in the
[43:30] Affairs of this
[43:32] life we are
[43:34] solders but the problem of it
[43:37] is many people desire to
[43:43] entangle into the Affairs of this
[43:46] life you cannot win your
[43:50] enemy if you are
[43:53] entangling in the Affairs of this
[43:56] when soldiers go to Afghanistan to
[43:59] fight they have no time to use
[44:04] WhatsApp they have no time for
[44:08] jokes everybody and anybody around them
[44:10] is an
[44:12] enemy a potential
[44:14] enemy so they always on higher
[44:17] L knowing anybody could be an
[44:21] enemy and someone could be a
[44:24] terrorist so they're going to be on High
[44:27] alarm but the Church of Jesus Christ is
[44:31] sleeping they are supposed to be
[44:34] soldiers but we are not on high
[44:37] L we don't pray
[44:39] anymore we don't cry after God we don't
[44:42] seek after
[44:44] God we don't read
[44:46] Bible if you a Christian and you don't
[44:49] read your
[44:51] Bible you can never live an overcoming
[44:54] life we don't read the
[44:57] Bible we we used to sing read your Bible
[45:00] and pray every
[45:01] [Music]
[45:04] day but this is never done
[45:07] anymore some Believers even don't have
[45:11] Bibles now let me talk to you who don't
[45:13] have a
[45:14] Bible and you think you are a
[45:17] soldier how can you be a
[45:19] soldier without a
[45:23] sword how do you know when soldiers go
[45:26] to
[45:27] battle their gun is their
[45:31] life and if their life has been taken
[45:35] away from
[45:36] them they are considered
[45:40] dead they tell them if you fall down
[45:42] fall
[45:44] down but protect your
[45:46] gun this is your
[45:49] life let don't let your enemy touch
[45:51] it this is your lifeline and I want to
[45:55] say the same thing
[45:56] this is our
[45:58] life the word of God is our
[46:00] life but do we read it or do we just
[46:04] have it but if you don't have a Bible
[46:08] and you don't even have a h to have
[46:10] a I believe no one in this church
[46:13] especially should claim that you don't
[46:15] have a
[46:17] Bible because I believe everybody should
[46:19] have
[46:20] a and if you don't have a Bible come we
[46:23] shall buy you a
[46:24] Bible

[46:38] man who doesn't have a Bible in the
[46:39] youth meetings let them have a
[46:43] Bible I'm telling you and you cannot
[46:47] claim that you don't have a
[46:49] Bible you don't want to have
[46:51] one but God will always raise
[46:54] somebody if you don't don't have a sword
[46:58] God will arm
[47:00] you he will arm
[47:02] you because he needs you to fight and
[47:05] the Bible is one of our
[47:07] arms and we should fight with it read

[50:12] t you sing you know but these days no
[50:15] one has time for
[50:17] it when you begin a song you begin
[50:20] seeing one of one by one going
[50:23] away where are they going
[50:26] they are going to entangle into the
[50:27] Affairs of this
[50:30] life everybody is
[50:32] busy no hunger no thirst no
[50:37] desire no
[50:38] pool towards the things of
[50:41] God that's a sign of
[50:45] backsliding It's a Sign you know what do
[50:48] they do when they go out
[50:49] there you know when they together
[50:52] they're just doing you know rumors
[50:56] talking this and that did you hear this
[50:58] did you see this did you see that did
[51:02] you what hear what the pastor say they
[51:05] begin talking negative
[51:07] things about fellow
[51:10] brothers about
[51:12] sisters they begin talking about what
[51:14] went wrong in the
[51:16] church and they can never be among those
[51:18] who will bring the
[51:22] solutions why because they're entangling
[51:24] themselves
[51:26] into the Affairs of this life so then
[51:29] how can you be a good
[51:32] soldier you know all these things I've
[51:34] been talking
[51:36] about these are tools that can make us
[51:40] busy we can become so busy that we don't
[51:43] have time for
[51:46] borom you don't need a pastor to tell
[51:48] you to you know do Bible
[51:51] study or to tell to hear the message or
[51:54] to tell to go and do
[51:56] evangelism I was never
[52:00] bored growing up in in this
[52:03] message I believe it when I was 15
[52:06] years I was just a
[52:08] boy but I'm telling you what did what
[52:12] what did we used to do you know just go
[52:14] up and
[52:16] about with nothing about about this
[52:20] message brother Dixon we used to tell
[52:22] people God has sent a
[52:24] prophet we were not shying away from it
[52:28] we were not
[52:29] ashamed but you see what the thing of it
[52:33] is the young people are now
[52:37] ashamed of standing with what they
[52:41] believe do you know if you are not
[52:44] concerned you are not
[52:48] convinced but anybody who is
[52:52] concerned you will be convinced
[52:56] about telling
[52:57] others about this message I rarely went
[53:01] to church
[53:05] alone I always picked a friend in the
[53:09] week and I would share with them the
[53:12] message and prepare them up to the
[53:17] level where now they are ready to hear
[53:19] the
[53:20] preaching and I would bring them to
[53:23] church you know and while the pastor is
[53:26] preaching I would be on fire not really
[53:29] for
[53:30] myself but for my
[53:32] friend whenever the pastor hit some
[53:36] Nots that I had already discussed with
[53:39] my friend I look at him like this I T on
[53:43] him are you hearing are you hearing
[53:46] because I was
[53:48] excited this message and when you are
[53:51] excited about the
[53:52] message you are going to share it with
[53:56] let us come out of our comfort
[53:59] zones let us leave those bom
[54:02] things and let us be you know on
[54:05] fire let us not be
[54:08] entangle I never watched
[54:11] football I never went to movie
[54:15] theaters I never you know went to
[54:19] bars I never went to
[54:22] lud what was I using my time with
[54:26] I was using it to
[54:29] evangelize speak to my friends one by
[54:33] one I was you know studying the
[54:37] message I would take a book and read the
[54:42] message while I am taking notes you know
[54:45] it's not because I was a
[54:47] preacher but it was a desire to know
[54:50] more of
[54:52] God and I believe each of us can do that
[54:56] imagine if each of us did that we would
[55:00] have a big time
[55:02] Revival among
[55:05] everybody we would have no time for boy
[55:08] girl
[55:10] relationships until we are ready for
[55:13] marriage we would have no time for
[55:17] wasting but if you are
[55:20] Idol the devil will have a lot to bring
[55:23] your away
[55:25] and I don't
[55:27] mind is a devil's
[55:30] worksh the devil will come to you and
[55:33] bring
[55:35] ideas and then you will agree with them
[55:38] because you have too much
[55:40] time because you bored so the devil will
[55:44] make you
[55:45] busy but I don't know about you as far
[55:48] as I'm concerned I don't want the devil
[55:51] to make
[55:52] me I don't want to be entangled in the
[55:54] Affairs of
[55:56] I want to be entangled in the Affairs of
[55:59] the
[56:01] Kingdom what I'm speaking about I'm
[56:04] talking about the life that is
[56:07] coming let me tell you life is coming
[56:11] but also fire is
[56:13] coming what will it be for
[56:15] you you know we have to make a
[56:19] choice every one of us young
[56:21] people especially when you are still
[56:23] young you make a choice what will it be
[56:27] for
[56:28] you will it be life or
[56:32] fire as far as I'm concerned I made a
[56:36] choice it is going to be life and
[56:39] everything I do the friends I met to
[56:43] help me keep the
[56:45] life not entangling
[56:48] myself in their Affairs in their things
[56:52] because I'm a soldier I'm a soldier of
[56:56] the army of the Lord I am going to
[56:59] overcome I am not going to accept defeat
[57:03] I'm going to overcome I'm going to fight
[57:06] I am not going to be in
[57:08] tangle I am
[57:11] intentional I am intentional in
[57:12] everything I'm
[57:15] doing and that's how each of us should
[57:19] be but false
[57:22] teachers will not tell you that
[57:26] first teachers in second Peter CH
[57:31] 2:8 the Bible say speaks of them this
[57:34] wayse when they speak great swearing
[57:36] words of
[57:38] vanity they Allure they Allure through
[57:41] the lust of the flesh through much
[57:46] wantonness those that were
[57:49] clean escaped from them who live in
[57:53] error
[57:57] [Music]
[58:16] while they promise them Liberty they
[58:19] themselves are the Servants of
[58:20] corruption for of whom a man is overcome
[58:24] of the same is he brought in
[58:40] bondage we shall come to that for if
[58:43] after they have escaped the pollutions
[58:45] of the world through the knowledge of
[58:47] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they
[58:49] are again entangled therein and overcome
[58:53] the latter end is worse with them than
[58:55] the
[59:00] [Music]

[1:00:11] now this is a very good Evangelistic
[1:00:16] text let me read for you this portion
[1:00:19] the same portion in the Amplified
[1:00:23] Bible
[1:00:25] Verse 18 for uttering loud basts of
[1:00:31] folly they
[1:00:33] beguile and lure with lustful desires of
[1:00:36] the flesh those who are barely escaping
[1:00:39] from them who are
[1:00:42] wrongdoers they they they beguile and
[1:00:45] lure lustful
[1:00:49] desires yes those who are barely
[1:00:53] escaping from them
[1:00:57] who are
[1:00:58] wrongdoers they promise them
[1:01:02] Liberty when they themselves are the
[1:01:04] slaves of De
[1:01:07] privity and
[1:01:09] defilement what good is it for a
[1:01:11] preacher to preach to you Liberty
[1:01:13] Freedom
[1:01:17] power but when you know you are on your
[1:01:19] way to
[1:01:21] hell when you know your life is not
[1:01:23] right with God
[1:01:26] but it says these people they promise
[1:01:28] them
[1:01:30] Liberty when they themselves as slaves
[1:01:33] of De privity and
[1:01:37] defilement for by whatever anyone is
[1:01:40] made inferior or
[1:01:45] worse or is
[1:01:49] overcome to that person or thing is
[1:01:53] enslaved
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:58] if it is
[1:01:59] money if you become a slave if if money
[1:02:03] overcomes
[1:02:04] you if the love and the last for
[1:02:08] it if you become inferior to
[1:02:12] it are you hearing me church if you
[1:02:15] become inferior to
[1:02:18] money the last and the love of
[1:02:21] it then you become a slave of you become
[1:02:23] a slave of
[1:02:26] if you become a slave if you if you you
[1:02:29] are under that
[1:02:32] desire that last full desire for
[1:02:36] something for anything it may be
[1:02:40] anything it may be an idea or even a
[1:02:44] person it may be anything but when you
[1:02:47] accept to become
[1:02:50] inferior to become
[1:02:53] something take away anything but leave
[1:02:57] this when they touch that they have
[1:03:00] touched your
[1:03:01] heart you stop functioning the Bible
[1:03:04] says you have become a
[1:03:07] slave and we see in the world we are
[1:03:09] living
[1:03:10] now people are slaves to many
[1:03:13] things people are slaves to
[1:03:16] football people are slaves to
[1:03:19] movies people are
[1:03:21] slaves you know to games and
[1:03:26] whereby someone ask me is it a
[1:03:29] sin let me tell you if it's not a sin I
[1:03:33] ask you something are you above it or
[1:03:36] are you under
[1:03:40] it anything if it is above
[1:03:44] you if it is not Jesus it is a
[1:03:48] sin anything it may even be a wife or
[1:03:53] husband but if it's above
[1:03:55] you more than Jesus Jesus should take
[1:03:59] the first
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:01] priority in your life but we see they
[1:04:05] overtaken by this
[1:04:06] things some people they submit to
[1:04:10] last you know and then they be these
[1:04:13] lustful
[1:04:14] desires begin to rule over them and they
[1:04:18] become a slave to them you know they
[1:04:21] will submit to this desires
[1:04:25] that is entangling
[1:04:27] yourself in the Affairs of this
[1:04:30] life but as a good
[1:04:33] soldier nothing should be above
[1:04:36] you but your
[1:04:39] commander and our war
[1:04:42] Captain our
[1:04:44] commander is Jesus Christ is the word of
[1:04:48] God it should be the only thing above
[1:04:51] us everything else below us
[1:04:54] everything else should not rule over
[1:04:56] us but where you let a
[1:05:00] situation a condition it may even be a
[1:05:04] condition you are
[1:05:06] in or a
[1:05:08] thought and then you are troubled by
[1:05:11] him you are troubled by
[1:05:14] him until you can no longer think
[1:05:19] straight many people get into
[1:05:22] depression why because they have become
[1:05:25] a
[1:05:26] slave to that
[1:05:29] thought can you imagine many people can
[1:05:32] I have a thought that see I am not
[1:05:40] beautiful that's just a thought I am not
[1:05:43] beautiful and then the devil will take
[1:05:46] that
[1:05:47] thought and will
[1:05:49] slowly drag you under that thought
[1:05:56] and then you will not think anything
[1:05:59] else but that you are
[1:06:02] Ang when someone looks at
[1:06:05] you you feel bad oh they're looking at
[1:06:09] how they looking at how ugly I
[1:06:14] am oh they looking at how little or
[1:06:16] small I
[1:06:19] am or they're looking at how bad I look
[1:06:25] you have become a
[1:06:26] slave to that little
[1:06:29] thought and that's entangling
[1:06:33] yourself in the matters of this life
[1:06:36] listen I don't care whether I'm
[1:06:39] beautiful
[1:06:40] ugly
[1:06:42] handsome tall short I am a
[1:06:46] soldier I have a fight to
[1:06:48] fight I have a battle to win I don't
[1:06:52] care about how I lost these are matters
[1:06:54] of this life I have a
[1:06:58] Resturant and you see many people are
[1:07:01] overtaken by
[1:07:02] those that's why women you will find
[1:07:06] them painting
[1:07:07] themselves you will find them you know
[1:07:10] even changing their skin
[1:07:14] color they bleach
[1:07:16] it I'm so black oh goodness I'm so
[1:07:21] black I'm so black become a slave to
[1:07:26] that and the devil tells them now
[1:07:28] because you're so black bleach
[1:07:30] yourself and they begin
[1:07:33] bleaching I'm so black they become a
[1:07:37] slave why now at that
[1:07:41] moment they are becoming a
[1:07:43] slave and they entangling
[1:07:46] themselves into matters
[1:07:49] aairs they're losing
[1:07:52] focus when the devil bring a
[1:07:54] blow a bullet it will come
[1:07:58] straight because you
[1:08:01] distracted many times we are defeated in
[1:08:03] this
[1:08:04] life not because God is not with
[1:08:07] us but because we are
[1:08:12] distracted even a good
[1:08:14] driver can
[1:08:17] knock if they are
[1:08:20] distracted if you look at this or that
[1:08:24] it is people who will come in your life
[1:08:27] and I tell you without me you are
[1:08:30] nothing without me you are gone without
[1:08:34] me there is no future for you I am your
[1:08:37] blessing if you don't have me you are
[1:08:39] under cast that is a matter of this

[1:09:15] you are in the will of
[1:09:17] God no man can control your
[1:09:20] des and some people will come to you and
[1:09:23] say
[1:09:25] words that are very
[1:09:27] sharp maybe some of you are
[1:09:29] here and someone has spoken to you sharp
[1:09:33] things until you cannot go away from
[1:09:37] them and then whatever you do it fails
[1:09:40] to
[1:09:41] prosper then you
[1:09:43] say that person cast
[1:09:46] me for sure it
[1:09:50] worked let me try this and I
[1:09:52] see maybe I will prosper it doesn't work
[1:09:58] out the C is working on
[1:10:01] me you are a
[1:10:03] slave it's a
[1:10:05] thought maybe you you committed a
[1:10:08] sin in your life and it it you know you
[1:10:13] repented of it but the devil knows your
[1:10:19] memory is not like God's
[1:10:21] memory God gets every sin that is under
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:27] blood but you
[1:10:29] don't and the devil
[1:10:32] doesn't that's the only thing we have in
[1:10:33] common with the
[1:10:37] devil and he will come to you tormenting
[1:10:41] you say ah I think I'm
[1:10:44] cured I know what I did before I
[1:10:49] believe I know I'm under a cur I can't
[1:10:52] come out of this situation
[1:10:54] let me tell you you are a slave you have
[1:10:57] no freedom because you are enslaved by
[1:11:01] that thing which has made you
[1:11:03] INF it has overcome you it may be last
[1:11:07] orful
[1:11:09] desire it may be a thought like I mean
[1:11:12] this area of life where you become
[1:11:17] enslaved for if after they have escaped
[1:11:20] pollutions of the world through the you
[1:11:23] know the full personal knowledge of the
[1:11:25] Lord Jesus
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:31] Christ listen church we Are Soldiers
[1:11:34] remember don't allow any
[1:11:37] thoughts to enslave you don't allow any
[1:11:41] mind of the devil to enslave you
[1:11:45] whatever is under the blood is under the
[1:11:49] blood whatever you have walked away from
[1:11:53] it canot not amen you know change your
[1:11:57] destiny the moment you met
[1:12:00] Jesus things
[1:12:03] changed a Destiny was changed and from
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:08] moment the past cannot affect
[1:12:11] you Jesus does not come just make us
[1:12:15] better
[1:12:17] people he comes to change
[1:12:22] everything he you know a soldier is
[1:12:28] timed changed they Chang the
[1:12:32] timing they change their
[1:12:36] trajectory when Jesus comes you have to
[1:12:39] be
[1:12:41] changed are you hearing me you know the
[1:12:45] way you think it has to be change that's
[1:12:49] why some people they say is
[1:12:52] brainwashing oh yeah it is brainwashing
[1:12:56] because we are
[1:12:58] recruited in the greatest
[1:13:00] army it is an Elite
[1:13:03] Force where our mind has to be
[1:13:07] changed where our mind has to be
[1:13:10] renewed whereby we are no longer
[1:13:14] under the thoughts that rule
[1:13:17] over we are being ruled
[1:13:20] over by a higher soul
[1:13:24] which
[1:13:25] thought the thought of the
[1:13:28] world where he says I know the thoughts
[1:13:31] I have toward
[1:13:33] you thoughts of good and not of evil I
[1:13:38] thoughts of
[1:13:39] prosperity the thought of God
[1:13:42] is your mind is tuned
[1:13:47] differently oh my
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:54] and he says here we have
[1:13:57] escaped after we have
[1:13:59] escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:14:01] through the full personal
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:08] knowledge
[1:14:15] of they again after they have done
[1:14:19] that they again become
[1:14:22] entangled in those
[1:14:25] thoughts in them and are
[1:14:31] overcome that's the problem and that's
[1:14:33] what I'm talking about today many
[1:14:36] Believers after
[1:14:38] believing then they reach somewhere and
[1:14:42] they
[1:14:43] again are
[1:14:46] overcome and they get
[1:14:49] entangled and the Bible says when that
[1:14:52] happens they last
[1:14:55] condition is
[1:14:57] worse for them than the
[1:15:00] first rather if you have decided to be a
[1:15:04] soldier let us let us move as
[1:15:08] soldiers let us fight as
[1:15:11] soldiers let us you know a soldier is a
[1:15:14] soldier did you know you cannot just
[1:15:16] leave the
[1:15:18] Army did you know that the moment you
[1:15:22] recruited
[1:15:23] you cannot just
[1:15:26] leave are you hearing
[1:15:28] me if you're hearing me say
[1:15:31] Amen you cannot just
[1:15:33] leave tell your neighbor you cannot just
[1:15:37] leave you cannot just leave the moment
[1:15:40] you are
[1:15:42] recruited the moment you are amen your
[1:15:44] name is written
[1:15:46] down it is
[1:15:48] permanent you have to follow the
[1:15:50] standing
[1:15:52] order if the order says run
[1:15:55] run if the order says sit sit if the
[1:15:58] order says stand stand if the order says
[1:16:01] raise up your hand do it and here the
[1:16:03] order is saying we are going to overcome
[1:16:06] the world the order is saying going to
[1:16:09] overcome the world and so shall it
[1:16:12] be what I say we should not be in tangle
[1:16:17] in the Affairs of this life the things
[1:16:20] we left the things we foru
[1:16:23] the last we live the fornication we live
[1:16:27] the smoking we live the drinking we live
[1:16:30] the we left we should not be entangled
[1:16:35] again we should be new
[1:16:37] people because if you go back
[1:16:41] again your condition will be the
[1:16:45] worse than the first for never to have
[1:16:48] obtained a full personal
[1:16:51] knowledge of the way of righteousness
[1:16:57] have been better for
[1:17:00] them than having obtained such
[1:17:05] knowledge and then not to turn back from
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:10] command they has befallen them the
[1:17:13] things spoken of in the true
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:20] proverb the dog
[1:17:23] turns back to his
[1:17:26] own and the
[1:17:28] soul is washed only to wallow again in
[1:17:30] the
[1:17:34] may not
[1:17:37] accept to go back in your
[1:17:40] vomit brother don't accept to go back in
