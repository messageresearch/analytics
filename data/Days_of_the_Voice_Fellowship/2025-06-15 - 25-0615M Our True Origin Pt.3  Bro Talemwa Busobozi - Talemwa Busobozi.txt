If can all stand and get into the word this morning. Amen. How many love the Lord? How many love the word of God? Amen. And we are going to the book of revelation chapter 5 and uh while you are opening there I just wanted to let you know that uh I wanted us to have a a meeting after the service today but in incidentally we had I have a few people that have made an appointment with me to see me after the service. So I just want to announce that the Lord willing next Sunday after service we will stay back and have not another service but an a meeting where we will be able to discuss a few things regarding the land fund. uh generally the land fund for our land. Yeah, we'll discuss things on that as well as it is June now in the middle of June actually. So that's half the year gone. So I'd like us to also talk about uh the next youth camp. How many have been looking forward to the next youth group? I know we've not talked about much about it this year, but uh let us uh meet and discuss about it. You know that youth camp takes a lot of money and after the last one we had uh I was having mixed feelings. uh mixed feelings. When you see the impact of it, you really you know it is the will of God. When you see how much it it costs, then you get discouraged. But uh you know traveling you know uh the trip that I I've just become from um I was so impressed to see how many uh that those meetings are reaching literally in every country that I went people were just appreciating those youth meetings and how how much they impacting them. And I really felt encouraged. I said, "Lord, I do not know how, but I know it is your will. We are going to pray. I know that the Lord is is a provider." Amen. So, we will uh we will speak on those things as a church next Sunday after the service. We are reading Revelation 5. Greetings from Sister Rose. She was not able to come. She got stuck where she went for business this week. uh week and also a brother Fred is in Masaka where he's trying to uh he told me he he went do to do a trial job but uh he asked that we pray for him that God will give him a job here in Kala be able to be in the fellowship and also received greetings from sister Phoebe. I understand she went to visit family in Masa. So let's get to Revelation 5. We are beginning with verses one verses 1 to vers 10. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof?" And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look there on. [Music] And one of the elders said unto me, weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld law and I beheld and law in he in the midst of the throne uh and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and uh to me, he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. [Music] And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them hs and golden vials full of orders, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth. Amen. [Music] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us pray. Loving Jesus, there are many things packed up in my heart. I would not know how to bring it except you help me. Lord, help me this morning as I commit these people, Lord, into your hands, Lord. These are the purchase of your blood. I do not take them for granted. Lord, uh, you've called me to preach this gospel because I am the best. But Lord, because I find I found grace in you. And now, Lord, I pray that you will use me this morning, Lord, in the way that uh you you you have desired that your people will be blessed. And Lord also used my brother Henry who is going to interpret that he will be an interpreter with inspiration this morning. Lord may you bring him into the same channel that your people may hear from you. Grant it Lord I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Please be seated. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This morning I'm speaking on the third part of our true origin. Amen. Are you following me? Is that a man? Uhhuh. I'm looking for something here that uh I I read for you last night, brother. I don't know if we can be able to Okay, I'll just search it out and I know I'll get it fast. Mhm. Now friends, um, you know, I u I'm finding the the right words or the best words. Um, I thank God for this message. uh the entire message which we believe um because it's a special message. Amen. Um I um personally I came from Anglican church and in the Anglican church I thought that I knew what I knew that I knew too much. But I realized I knew nothing when I came into this mess and there is no way absolutely I can be able to return where I came from. because of what I know today. And to those of you who are in Roman Catholicism, when you came out, you realized, there was a a higher revelation you had gotten to. Uh you remember the brother I told you that I met in uh in uh uh Path in the city of Path. He told me everything you preached. is a brother actually. He follows Apostle Grace here. He told me, "Oh, you know, I've been following TB Joshua. When he died, I started following Kaki then, but now I'm following Apostle Grace and I'm following his ministry somehow from Uganda." I said, "All right." And I invited him to church. So when he came in church and he sat and heard the word, of course in the me churches we preach the message of him. He told me now everything you are preaching I could tell it was the truth. Much of it I I already had in my system. But there are other things you have said that I feel I it is an upgrade to what I already have in my system and my computer system. My computer talking about is spiritual system needs an upgrade of with what you have computer system. All these denominations They have so much light but they fall short somewhere. They fall short. And you see it's been in seasons. It has been you know right from the first church age. God has the church of Jesus has been progressing coming into maturity. But that's why you you know the the the angry angry will tell the Catholic I have father light. The Methodist will tell the angry I have father light. The Pentecostal will tell everybody else I have father life. And then you have the oneness Pentecostals the Jesus only they will tell all the other Pentecostals and all the other denominations. We have father light and every one of those is right. But the light they have cannot be any other light apart from what God had shined in their life. It was God who shined in their day. But you know the problem they denominated. They built a camp. Man has always wanted to denominate. You know it's just in man. They always want to denominate. When they denominate, they die. God leaves them and he continues without because you cannot denominate God. You cannot organize God and lock himself. All those denominations are saying ours is the truth. We are the right ones. They are right according to the revelation they had in their day. [Music] And the Holy Spirit moved on. Where is the Holy Spirit today? The Holy Spirit is not in any denomination. He has moved on. He's calling a people with an end time message to come out from denominations to come out from church systems, to come out from religion and be united again with the bridegroom Christ. And he is using what we are calling the end time message. people. The problem with people, they always wanted to denominate. You remember when he when when the presence of God came down on the mountain, the disciples saw that it was Peter, Luke, and John. And they said, "We have a suggestion because God is here and we have realized who you are. Let us make a three tents. Let us make a three denomination. We build one here, one there, one. And that's what they have always done. And how do you know the characteristics of a denomination will say this here in the right church what I'm talking about today is very important you are seeing what is happening in the world the rapture is about to happen. Open your eyes. You know when I came back when I went to Australia, I'll tell you one thing that really impacted me. I I travel many places and I have many times you realize you you had an inspiration that you preached on before. So I'll preach about it again. But when I went among some of these brothers, I could not preach the inspirations I had before I had preached to you. And I found out the reason is because these brothers are so deeply rooted in the word in the word of this day, in the message of the hour. And I said to myself, so I went to God in prayer to give me an inspiration to preach among them. He gave it to me and this is where I've been preaching since Sunday and it will be for a while. I mean different titles. It is the same thing. I want us to understand something. For so long preachers in the message are preaching what Pentecostals can even preach better. That is the truth. If I come to you and I preach to you faith, Kenneth Copeland and TD J can do it. If I preach to you healing and I make my ministry all around healing, I'm not saying it's not of God. It is of God. But I want you to understand. There are others from other revivals before our generation who can actually do it better because that's what they had for their people. But you see, revelation is progressing. God in our day is not coming for an imperfect church. He is coming for a perfect bride. So we need the church needs to grow unto the deeper things of God. Paul said, "When I was a child, I acted as a child. But when he grew, he did not act as a child anymore." We see fed them milk, but when they grow, they start eating the meat of the word. How many want the milk only? It is time for the church to mature. It is time for us to begin eating the meat of the world. Real meat, tangible, something which will re which will make you grow muscles and which will make you realize who you are. Milk can only help you at a certain stage. You have grown at a certain stage. You now not only need the milk, you need the milk plus the meat. So we are not leaving the foundation. We need all that. But we need to have the building finished on Wednesdays. Those of you who missed Wednesday, go back and listen to the on Wednesday. There are many things I said on that regard and I will not go back. And here he says the book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out. He's talking about this seven sealed book until all the ages has run out and there is no time no more. It's only revealed after church ages and denominational ages has run out. That's the reason the thing is in in such a scrapper tonight. They pick up a little doctrine and they run off here on one side and they say, "This is it. Another one picks up another doctrine and runs off this side." And he said, "This is it." and the church and each one builds a denomination under it. For us, we major on miracles. Here we speak on the inner man. Here we speak on faith. You go to such a church, you can hear all names of demons. They know them and all demon possessed people go there. There are very many things you can everybody say. We are holding this. We are holding that. picks a certain doctrine. This church is a prophetic church. That is why we only give prophecy. And you know they do they record themselves and then they they they say oh major prophecy and afterwards they say oh yeah no prophet matches our prophet. Another one makes another ministry. And this inspires people. [Music] You know, even when you you you you feel you are so weak. You go there and you you you by the time you come out, you feel you can carry the whole county, you are very strong. But as soon as you reach home, you forget everything. Why? Because these things are not the message of the hour. They do not have the power to bring about the change of your body. And these denominations have built their entire denominations on these things. And each one builds a denomination under it. until we have hundreds of way for them. and can pray for four to five hours without keeping quiet. Now when you go to such a church, you really see if you don't do that, you don't have heaven. Others they fast for 40 days. Listen brother, they build their lives. They build their miss on such a thing. The message of the hour we preach goes beyond all those. It goes beyond all those you meet others. They are only centered on the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit center around that without progressing. But when you know the message of the hour, you will know. You don't need to remain in one. You need to grow progress and you reach a level where you know who you are. What power you have? What time are you in? What promises are in the world are you supposed to fulfill? That is the message of this hour. Now listen, but still in all of it we see confusion the people are wondering what is truth and he says if that is the isn't the condition today indeed that's the condition today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But then he promises that when that time has finished out there will be the sounding of the seventh angel's message at the finishing of the time of the church ages. Amen. There would be the sounding of the seventh angel message. Okay, are you following me? Put put here Revelation 10:7. It is right there. And then the book will be revealed at that time. Listen, the lamb opened the book, but the book remained obscure until the time of the sounding of the seventh angel's message. Oh my good Lord. So there would be a time Amen. Amen. There would be a time when there will be at the seventh angel and the seventh angel's message the work his work will be revealing the seven seals. His work will be different from all what the others have done. He will tie all the loose ends through the church. Are you following me? Follow me. Just follow me. You see people when they when you don't understand the message that you believe the day you are living in. It is easy for you to go back to the denomination. But no man, no woman that has understood the mystery of the day, the message of the hour can go back to the denomination. No one can. It is impossible. It is impossible. Yesterday I met a friend of mine. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I was with him through school. preached to him the message. He believed he got baptized. But just before he could get deeper into the message where he might even be streaming, I don't know, he went overseas. So as he was overseas, he he um you know joined Fero there and so he now returned and so I sat down with him yesterday and I told him so tell me oh um what what's happening you no longer believe the message quite frankly I have never understood deeply what the message is all about but since I have been in Fero there are Many things I have learned that I never knew. And I told him, you are right only because that there is some light there. And I told him, even if you are sincere and you go to the Anglican church, you will rece. But if you've been in Fero and you go to Anglican church, you may think you're wasting your time because Fero has father compared to the other denomination. Are you understanding what I'm talking about? And then I told him but see brother there is more light. You see what you have learned? I can tell you something that we have a message in our day that is actually more like than what you have. He said for real. He said but I have been comfortable where I have been. And I told him this. I said let me tell you something. If you are in a basement and there is a a light switched on and and someone tells you come I take you there is father light outside and then you say no I'm comfortable here I am not in darkness I have light where you are right you have light where you are but that light is from electricity It is not a natural light. Every time it will go off. But but if you have revelation, you will say, "Take me, let me see this, father." And when you go out, you Oh my my understand what I'm preaching. You can't see further lie. [Music] When you stay in one place, you can't see father when you remain in your denomination. You can't see father. If you don't go out, you have to go out. And when you go out, then you will see you will rejoice at the power. And let me tell you one more thing. You cannot go back in the best when you see father. You cannot go back in. Some of you, some of us, we were in a basement. We were in a makeshift light. But now we have seen the light. The light has shined in darkness. And we have seen the light. And we have become the light. Oh Lord. Amen. That's why sisters, you no longer dress the way you used to dress. You no longer behave, brother, the way you used to behave. What happened to you? You receive father life. Father light more than the light you have. This is a natural life. can never go out until the day is done. And the day will not be done until the rapture comes. Hallelujah. Amen. That's when the day will be. We are in a new day. We have new light. Oh, father light. [Applause] Amen. If you've not seen it, don't worry. You'll see it. I met a brother. Amen. In a city of Melbourne. He's a good brother. He's a a Kenyan brother. He came from Kenya. And he went to to to Australia. And he met me and gave me his testimony. I was trying to remember his name. I can't remember his name right now. But he's a wonderful brother. And he told me, "Pastor, when I was in Kenya, I was in a message church, [Music] but I had not seen the light yet. I had not yet seen the light because he was born in the message. There are many of you born in families that believe the message. The reason why you are the way you are is because you have not seen this. But sister when you see this life something that happened to your father there something will happen this man he changed atmosphere he went to uh Australia and of course he was in all these things drinking smoking even weed he was into all of women, everything. But he said when he arrived to Australia, you know, if he came in this church and you know, you know, because he was used where he came from these people, father, mother church, it's a family church. That's why children of preachers are in a danger. Children of believers are in danger. Hey, you rather have a child that believes and come to. But those called by believers, they need to be prayed for a Lord. I'm talking about my children I have. They need prayer because they don't know what you're talking about. They still had a family religion sometimes. No wonder parents need to leave those churches to go into other message churches. I was telling my wife one of my daughters if she grows and say she wants to go to another church I won't stop her you want to have your children in the church feel good but if they don't understand what you say as a family change and go under God can reveal and they will see the light. The same man said when he went to this church he was hearing new things but I noticed the same things I used to teach but to him it was new things. It was like someone was reaching out to him and he said, "I saw the light, brother. I saw the light. I gave up my life and and I surrender to Jesus. And from that day, I have been new. Things are changed. Threw away the alcohol, threw away the trials. I love the women in the Lord. God, I love this message. I said God bless you. I told him I saw the light. Many of you have seen the light and some of you have not seen the light. Rather seek the light. [Applause] You have to know where you came from. You have to know who you are. This message is not another denomination. And by preaching this message, we are not saying all the others don't have the truth. No, all the others have some truth. Some of them have a lot of truth and especially the Pentecostal preachers. Many of them are actually reading the message directly. They are reading the message. I was thinking whether I should tell you this story or not. I think I'll tell you without mentioning names. There's a a pastor friend of mine from the UK. He told me there's this very popular preacher. He keeps talking about brother Bam in a positive way. He told me he went to him and he said brother uh why don't you believe the messenger and he told him who is a message believer this popular all of you know him if I mention this popular preacher was the one asking who is the belief of the message the one who believes the message brother Bannon preached Listen to me. Yes. He he picked up his iPad and he showed him. What is this? What is this? Is it not the message? He told him, "I believe it from 1947 to 1965 and I read it every day." He's a Pentecostal preacher. [Music] He believes the message, but he can't he be like us. Brother Banham said he can't quote like that. I read you let me do that. You have to understand why. Not because the things are not correct, but because if he does that, he will lose the association of other pastors. And there's no way he can claim publicly he believes this and he quotes it when he is not telling the people to change their ways and believe according to the all the women will live. his church will become small and money will become small. And these kind of preachers love money. The pump and the big things. Imagine if you're a pastor of 10,000 and you preach this and you you announce from today I am believing this message and I believe women should not dress this because that's what the Bible say and I believe men should behave like this church should be like this if you speak in tongues there should be interpretation you begin putting the church in according to the message You must be baptized again in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in much water because the first water baptism was not according to the Bible. If you begin to tell people these things, they will walk away. Who wants that? Not even me. If half of you leave, I may pretend I'm not feeling it. But I can feel so bad. Every preacher does because a shepherd is is a shepherd of the sheep. You want them to come. You don't want them to go away. Sometimes you say go away, but that's when you are under the anointing. You really don't want anyone to come. That's the fact. And then you see that it has happened before in Kenya. a brother who had a huge church, 5,000 people, pastor, 5,000. He believed this message. He announced half the church left. He almost had a heart attack. But he stood. He got baptized again and the whole church that remained. Brethren, I tell you it is this is the hard way. This is the hard way. You see so many people who claim to believe Jesus. They came to believe the Bible, but their life does not match and they look like they are blessed by God. They are in the wide way. But this is the narrow way. Amen. Now I've not started my sermon this morning. I was just speaking a few of my convictions. So let's um get into the message now and see how much we will go. Maybe I will speak to you for another 30 minutes and then I will continue on on on Sunday next on Wednesday. Brother Shem is going to be speaking to us. So uh there's a lot I have to say but we only lack time. Now Revelation 5 um here there are many things I can read about. I'm just going to dwell on verses 9 today. But we see the Bible here the scene is opening when John is saying he he saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side. And this book was sealed with seven seals. I and he says, "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice. Who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals there? No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the nether to look their own. And now the Bible says, "And I wept much." You see why is John weeping? John is weeping because of one reason. No one is worthy to open them. And he knew because there is no one worthy and these seals are not open. The entire human race was in the seed of God was in. Are you following me now? If the book is not open, the seals are not broken seed of God is in trouble. Which means the devil has won which means the devil has taken over. There would be nothing like redemption because this seven sealed book is a book of redemption. Man had fallen, fallen from the glory of God, fallen from the image of God. Man needed to be restored. Man had fallen away. Brother puts it this way. He was on the other side on the other end of the cousin. Here is a cousin. This side is death, is sin, is uncleanness, inability, failure, sickness, trouble. And this is where we are all born. But there's another end of the perfection, holiness of God, sons of God, image of God, impossibility is made possible. There is no impossibility. Are you hearing me? Power, healing, miracles. Are you hearing me? This is on the other side. And here was John in the flesh, knowing he's also on this side. Every man that is born of a woman is on this side. And when he saw the book of redemption, this seven sealed book in the hand of him that sat on the throne. Who is it? This is God himself. Amen. Because you know who was the owner of this book? That was Adam. Listen to me now. Brother calls it titled. This book is a title. Adam lost it the moment they sinned in the Garden of Eden. But you see, he says it could not go in the filthy hands of Sat. Are you not so glad brother that your title did the devil cannot crazy? The devil has no power. Why? It could not go into his hand because he's a filthy devil. He has no power over what doesn't belong. He is only a squatter. He has no title deed. The title deed belongs to you. Belongs to you. Oh, glory to God. Amen. I have the title D. It belongs to me. Follow me closely. Amen. You know, no one was worthy. But that title D even if no one was worthy, the devil never possessed it. What is the title deed? The seven seal book. What is the seven book? The book of redemption. What is it? The abstract title deed. The devil couldn't have it. Amen. You may be in sin, but you are not owned by Satan. You may be born in sin, but the devil does not own you. Sin may touch your body, but the devil doesn't own your soul. That's why he told Job, you know, John Satan, he's all right. You cannot touch his body. Do not touch his soul. Amen. You remember that song. You know you can touch my body. You can kill my spirit. My soul but my soul. Hallelujah. Amen. But my soul is in his hand. The devil cannot kill your soul. He can torment your spirit but he doesn't own your soul. God has a title. God has authority and he told him you know do not touch his soul that you can go do everything you want to but in all that trouble. You know Job never cast God. No matter what you are going through. Amen. If you are se of God, if you are fall, you cannot cast. [Applause] The devil may bring you poverty. You may be frustrated, but you can't cast God. You may be sick. You may have an infirmity, but you can cast God. You may be tormented in your body, in your spirit, but you can't cast God. Why? There is a seed of God in you. Amen. Why? Because you are fornown for a knowledge point to what? Because you are fornown you were predestinated. Why predestinated to be conformed to the image? Remember the castle. You were predestinated. You are here. But before you are here, you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of son. This side that's where you belong. You need to be redeemed. Amen. Amen. And for someone to come, Amen. and they say they can redeem you, no man can redeem you. No man can come. You are already cast by unbelief. At the moment you believe by choice and decision. Amen. You are passed from death unto life. No more cast has power. Hallelujah. You have crossed the castle already. And the blood of Jesus atones for all your sins. Amen. See the book went into the hand of the original owner and here is God having a book in his right hand who is worthy who can take the book who can take the title and redeem back fallen man who the other side of the castle and bring him back to where he belong. bring him back to his true identity. Who is worthy? No man was worthy. No angel was worthy. For all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God. No one was worthy. And when John saw that, he knew what this meant. He knew that everyone is doomed. And John began weeping. John began weeping. Because there was no one. But as John was weeping, oh my I wish I have time. I wanted to go to verse 9. But as John was weeping, one of the elders, everybody tell your neighbor, one of the elders. Amen. One of the elders said unto John, Amen. Where is that? Vers. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not weep not. Now, how many elders were there? 24 elders. 12 New Testament. 12 Old Testament. Amen. Are you following me? John, was he one of the elders? Oh, yes. He was one of the disciples. So, John was one of the elders of the of the of the of the New Testament. Are you following me? So, who which el spoke to John? Come on, message me church. Which elder spoke to John? Was John one of the elders? So which which elder spoke to John? I can tell you something. He must have been an elder. Identical to John. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. John spoke to John. What are you talking about? What happened here? It was a revelation that struck John. Hallelujah. Amen. As he was weeping very hard from Ethiop. Let me tell you, you may be struggling with something. But there is something else. There is another body, a word body that you have. And when you hear the word, you hear from your thoughts speaks to you every day encourages you everything. You know what? You know what David, you know you can make it. You will go through you overcome the what is happening. John spoke to John. Weep not. Amen. And he said the lion of the tribe of Judah. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Where did the revelation come from? Remember I told you when we beginning this service that revelation is the biggest thing we should pray for. When you have revelation of who Jesus Christ is, you have received a revelation of who you are. John received a revelation on who was going to take the automatically by by that revelation which had come to him. He had received a revelation of who he was. Did you get it? Yes. He could no longer weep. Hallelujah. Because he had known who he is. So why do I weep? Let me even wipe the tears. Why do I weep? Why was he not weeping? Come to him. How did it come to him? There was no angel speaking to him. there was not able to speak to him. It was a revelation which had come the same way came to Peter. The same came to Peter and he said thou at Christ the son of the living. What was that revelation? There was no one speaking but it was a revelation. Amen. that he had received from God right from within him and the same thing here is happening. Amen. Weep not John for the lion of the tribe of John prevailed. Jesus told Peter flesh and blood I revealed this to you but my father in heaven. Did Peter go to heaven? Heaven had come down. Amen. When all of us will get this revelation, the rapture will go heaven and come down. And from that moment on, Peter could no longer weep. He had received the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. John by revelation had received the revelation. Oh, who is going to take the book? Let me tell you something. Something you may not know by this time Jesus had already died on the cross. So why was John weeping? Lack of revelation. Hallelujah. I feel so good this morning. Lack of revelation. Why are you weeping? Because of your condition. Lack of revelation. You don't have a revelation on who Jesus Christ is and who you are. That's the only reason why you are with him. John who had been with Jesus who had testified about him. And when he saw the book and no one was worthy, he cried. Why do we would he cry? He would have known there was one worthy who had already come and died and and and and and shed his blood and breached the cas. He would have already received that revelation. But he had no revelation. But when the revelation struck from that moment on John stopped weeping. Weep not John for the lion. This is how we receive the revelation for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to turn and to reveal to open a seal. Are you following me now? John wanting to know and to see the lion that had come to him through that voice. He turned to see Remember whatever you were seeing was in a vision, not physically there. You could see John, but John was not there where you thought he was. John was working in the realm of revelation, in the realm of visions like us today. The Bible says we are in heavenly places. When you go in Christ, there is a place a hidden place where the devil cannot join you. Hallelujah. And that is the Sabbath rest. John was in the Lord's day. The Lord's day is Sabbath. That means the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost. The devil can't find you. rather hide yourself there. Hide yourself there. The devil can't find you. And while you in the Holy Ghost, revelations will begin to pass. Visions of rapture bast [Music] bring for whispers of love. You now know that song. You know, now know that song was inspired. That song was inspired. You now know that. That's what it means. Sometimes we sing the songs and we don't understand walking in heavenly places. And and as John was walking there, he turned to see someone might have seen him turn. What is wrong with John? Remember they took him on that island to die, but he began to bust. The devil might think he placed you in that place to die right in the middle of your trial. If you a son or daughter, the devil cannot destroy you. But the devil rides on fear. And when the angel comes down, The first thing you say, "Fear not. Don't fear not. Don't fear not. Don't fear not. Don't fear." Tell your neighbor, "Fear not. Do not fear. Don't fear what a devil can do. Do not fear. Don't fear what a devil can bring because he can't touch you. You are in another dimension. You are in another realm. You are in a heavenly place. You are a priest of God. You are the king of God. Hallelujah. Amen. You are king with God. The devil cannot destroy. And John did not fear. It was a very poisonous island, but he was there busting into revelation. Think about it. Hallelujah. May God help me to bust into revelation. When I have no money in my pocket, I can begin to pray. He speak in tongue and I b into revelation. Bing to revelation. And when I see revelation, what do I see? I see myself blessed. If I need a house for my children, I see a home built. I I need a church for my for the brethren, I see a church built. on a land that we are collecting money for. But I see the church build. When you b into revelation, these are the things you begin to see. If you need marriage, you begin to see yourself on your wedding day. So people will see you in the church, others are praying for you are doing this. What's happening? You are seeing what others are not seeing. You're on your wedding day. Oh, I want God to help us to binge. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. If you want a baby, Amen. They may say you are crazy. Oh, brother Bam talks about Abraham, how he went to buy clothes and you know these other things. The doll is for your children. They said, "Papa, what's wrong with you?" But he was seeing revelations. Revelation brings action. So if you a mother and you are a baby, hallelujah, amen, you can even lose your mind. Amen. Come to a place where you begin to play with your baby. Come on, Junior. Don't disturb them. What's happening? They can't understand. But you are saying to them, you're crazy. To you, you are seeing a real in another world. Hallelujah. Amen. That's what I'm talking about. Basting into revelation where you have nothing to feed your children. where your husband tells you you go back to that church your marriage is lost and then you go to prayer when you go in prayer you pass into revelation you begin seeing yourself in love with your husband and he's saying oh darling I love you please go to church so you come to But darling, you allowed me to go to church. Where they allow you? I told you don't go to church. Are you crazy? Of course, you'll be crazy. But when you are in the spirit, you cannot be crazy. When God shows you a vision and you just act out the vision, You just act it out. Brother raised the dead. He never just went who where's the dead? Rise up. He first saw a vision and then he went to act it. We are actors of a finished work. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And John when he turned to see what did he see? He saw a lamb. You would think a lion is the one that is worthy. But when John turned to see, he saw a lamb. The lamb he already knew. The lamb had already touched the lamb that he had already been. So, from before the foundation, which means all those that the lamb died for, it was before they were born. It was before there was a world. Some land Pentecostal babies. And I say that because we are mature Pentecost. We I mean those who are mature. But there are Pentecostal babies who are un praying like this. Oh father come here brother. Oh father let brother's name here be remove from the book of death. Let it be written in the book of life. Go brother those kind of prayers for unlanded Pentecost. Why they have not they have not received the revelation of the seals. When you are preaching from an open book, there are prayers you can't pray. There are places you can't go. There are things you can't do. Why? Because you are preaching from an open eye. But when the book is closed, you are seeing through a glass dark. You do what everybody does. After all, Bishop, Reverend Dr. But now here we see there is a book and he says when I saw the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. If he was slain before the foundation of the world, it means he redeemed those names before the foundation of the world. It means It means, are you ready for it? It means you were saved before you were born, brother. [Applause] I know where I'm standing. Just follow. Just follow. You were redeemed before you came into your mother's womb. So why do we preach the gospel? Because when you were born, you were in the other side of the country and you had your eyes blinded by the circumstances around. You had spiritual amnesia. So when the gospel is coming, you come to yourself, your eyes are open, you realize who you are. I'm a son of God. And then you begin saying many earrings. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, brothers. You begin saying bye-bye prostitutes. Bye-bye. I'm going to marry one wife. I'm going to live as a son of God. I'm going to serve God. Bye-bye. What happens? You have realized who you are. Hallelujah. That is the result of the opening of the seal book. Amen. You realize you are the redeemed of the Lord. You realize, Amen. You are not of the lost. You are not of those from certain. You realize you are a person. Amen. This world is not worthy of it. Doesn't the Bible say you are a peculiar people, a holy nation, you are royal priesthood. Amen. Amen. That's what the Bible say. But we just read those things and we go on because you have no revenge. And when you if you can stop and say why did he say I am a person the world is not worthy of I'm a priest and a king. I'm a peculiar person. I am a holy nation. Hallelujah. Am I preaching to someone? You realize you are not what your father said you are. [Applause] Stupid foolish girl. You realize that's not who you are. You realize you are not even a in a a denominational person. You are not controlled by any man. You are controlled by the Holy Ghost. Some say if you leave this church, your blessings are remaining. But then you realize your blessings are not with me. Your blessings are in the word with Christ in knowing who you are. Your blessings are there. So the lamb that was red that there was strength for the world. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And he prevailed and and and to lose the seven seals there. When he died at the cross, lose the seals. Can we say amen to that and and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and the mid of the elders. Praise the name of the Lord. Stood a lamb as it have been slain having seven horns and having seven eyes. Amen. On the lamp, what is there? Seven church agents and the messengers there. It's all in him. We sing a song. It's in you, oh Lord. You you know in revelation 3 you find a candlestick and you know stars on the right in the right hand of the son of man and he was in the middle of the candlestick is the same verse here that is speaking of the lamb he's the one in the midst of the church the church is the candlestick is the strength of the lamb. The horns is what any animal uses to fight. Amen. And I will tell you what is the strength of the animal. The strength of Christ, the strength of the lamb is you the church. You are his strength on earth. Amen. are the messengers, seven eyes. Amen. I see an eye. Throughout the ages, in every age, there has been a messenger. And you know what? There is no way the devil can come from when God is not seeing him because he has seven eyes, seven church ages. What does he have? Seven messengers anointed to see. They don't only now they see a lot when they see the enemy and they warn the bride where the enemy is coming from. Second, what do I see? They see the word and they break the word to the church. They are seers. Seers are prophets. And he came and took up took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the 20ers fell down having every one of them hed and goss full of which are the prayers of the saints. And here I'm I was just trying to rush through to come to this. And they sang a new song. Let me stop right there. Amen. Because the lamb has taken and lamb has lost. Amen. We cannot sing an old song. We have a new song to sing. Tell your neighbor. Tell your neighbor you have a new song to sing. Amen. We can no longer sing the same old song. Things are difficult. I am dying. I'm getting crazy. The world is finishing me. You have a new song, brother. I am redeemed. I am chosen. I am prevailing over Satan. I'm overcoming my sickness. I'm overcoming my trouble. I am more than a conqueror. I am a child of God. I am not going in a rapture and I'm redeemed. I have a vision of who I am. I am not a failure. I am an overcomer. You are singing a new song. I am a bride of Christ. I am no longer anomination. Amen. I am a royal priesthood. I am a holy nation. Come on church. We have a lot of things we can do. [Applause] The Bible says, "Is there someone Mary sing?" Why shouldn't we be happy when the lamb has taken and the lamb has lost? Why shouldn't we be happy? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why shouldn't you be happy and you see beyond what you see? Hallelujah. Why shouldn't you be happy? Your enemy the moment the seals are losed. Your enemy is no longer. Why should that you be happy? The seals were open. But it has to be revealed to you personally. If it is revealed to you, then you realize who you are. Why shouldn't you be happy? When you realize who you are, a son of God with the authority as good as what God has, you have no power. But you have authority. A little a little small police officer has no power. Even you brother can go and kick him or kick her down. But she has authority will stand before a very huge Sharon. Sharon come up here. You just met seven years. So you can help me preach today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I wanted to imagine a police officer like this and you are coming brothers some four people come. I want I want to demonstrate this to you so you can see it. Some big big fat people. Uhhuh. Extend the other side like go in a row. Go in a row. Go in a line. Go in a line. Behind behind. Right now they're going to move. When they begin moving, you raise your hand like this. Raise. I see how you raise it. No, not like that. Like this like a police officer on the road. You have to be like don't feel you. You have authority. I have allowed you. I'm I'm now your government. No one will touch you. I'm protecting you. So don't fear the eyes. Just raise your hand with a lot of force. So when they coming you will do that under. Okay. So when they has authority if you don't stop you will receive. Come on. You have to stop them if you want. You see? What is that? Authority. Does she have the power this one man can carry her and throw her in the air? But she has authority. I know who is why just someone backing you. God bless you brothers. God bless you sisters. The bride when you realize who you are when you know you are redeemed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Authority has been restored to you. [Applause] Amen. And you have a guarant. He's right behind you. No one can touch you. No one can do anything to you because he is the redeemer of your soul. The kings man redeemer. He also the kings man avenger. Let me tell you he's the protector of our ted. Hallelujah. And when he redeemed it, amen, what did he do? He brought it back to you. He gave you your true identity. Now you on the other side of the cage. You are no longer of the of the ones who are getting lost. You are no longer of those in sudden Aiden. You are redeemed. To be redeemed means you have never sinned in the first place. You are perfect in the other side. So you have authority to stop anything you want to stop. You have authority to speak a word by a revelation and inspiration and it will happen. I've not had time to read for you all these quotes, but I have a bunch of them here that I would have wanted to read for you, but I've not read anything. And that's okay. I will not going to read him because time is finished. But I want to tell you friends, you have authority. You're restored back to who you were before the fall. What Adam lost, Amen is now yours. You can now say Jesus is mine. Why? Because you have the same authority. Even your sins are gone, completely gone. Because it speaks of the bleach. The the the bleach. You know, if you take an ink, this is one of the quotes I wanted to read for you. If you take an ink and you throw it into the bleach, the ink will disappear. Completely. You cannot trace it back. It has disappeared. That is what the bleach can do. Bleach has power, chemical power, natural power to completely erase a a stain and the stain will be gone permanently. It's is an acid turn back completely. And now we see brother Bam quotes and talks about Abraham. Brother Moses, he says Moses was under the blood of bulls and goats as a bleach to cover their sins. But you know what? Moses was told by God he could command flies to to appear and flies appear. Frogs and frogs appear. God never spoke them. Moses spoke them into existence. Moses turned water into blood. But remember, Moses was under the power of the bleach of the blood of boots and garments. And yet his word was made good. Because Moses was given authority by God. Moses had known what who he is. Even when he was still under the blood of how much more us who are under the blood of the redeemer, the one who was worthy. The one who took the book, the one who lose the sins, he is our redeemer. His name is Jesus Christ and what he did. Amen. His blood is the bleach that we all sins there and they are remembered no more. We are restored. By the power of this blood, at this point we can speak anything. The authority we have is more than what Mo Moses had. The church of the New Testament is the reality of the shadow of the Old Testament. We can speak things into existence. We are sons of God. Let me read just a portion as I when he he crossed he separated his sunship. He's a sinner by nature. He's under this the hands of a dominion of Satan beside him and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood. But the blood of bulls and goats they did not divorce sin. It only covers sin. If I've got a red spot on my hand and cover it with white, the red spot is still there. It is still there. But God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin. It was the blood of his own son. that when our confessed sins drops into God's bleach, try to find it again. Find those sins. Where are they? Where are they? Hallelujah. Let me ask you again. Where are they? [Music] As far as removed as darkness is from God in the sea of forgetfulness. It's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I have I hope I I wish I could hear many hallelujah. The coloring of seeing God's back through the mediators down through the time until this good one. until it goes all the way. Oh my, you are going to love this one. And it heals the accuser [Applause] and he lays on him until the day of judgment. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Amen. It goes back. Why? Because of the bleach of the blood of Jesus. What happens to the son? What happens to you? He becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again. standing on the other side of the car. No remembrance of sin against you. No more. Everybody say no more. No more sin. There is no more stain of the bleach. Can see anywhere. You are free. I said you are free. Come on, say it. Amen. Believe it. Amen. You are free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just as that Clorox or that ink can can never be ink no more because it is broken up and sent back again. And when confessed sin is confessed and been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ. It kills all symptoms and every mole of sin goes back to the devil and he laid on him till the day of judgment. That's where his eternal destination will be thrown into the lake of fire and they cast him bridge and never to come in remembrance no more. and man stands justified as a son of God. Simplicity. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now in conclusion, listen to this. Moses under the blood of boo with his confession in the word of God and God could take that simple man and put his words in his mouth and he proved that he was Jehovah's servant. God proved that Moses was Jehovah's servant for he could walk out there and Jehovah spoke to him by vision. He walked out, stretched his hands toward the east. And I remember God had spoken to him. It is God's thought. God uses man. [Music] God spoke to him. It's right. He said, "Go stretch that rod in your hand towards the east and say flies flies. Locust, I think it was locust." Moses under the blood of that goat, he walked out there. took that stick, reached towards the east. Thus sayith the Lord, let there be fly. Never had a fly. He walked on back. It is already spoke. He did not wait for it. He spoke. He walked back. It is a thought now. It is spoke. It is expressed. It is the word of God. It come into a human lips. A simple man under the blood of a boy or a god. Now he says a fly begin to fly around in this pond. That pond the word of God was spoken through Moses the creator. Moses the creator. Moses the creator. the creator. Have you understood it? Do you want a situation to be created around you? You are the creator. You the word of God through you as a son of God. The creator because under the blood you standing in the presence of God and his words wasn't his word. your word, not your words. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, then ask what? Whatsoever you desire, it shall be given to you. Amen. Where is the church standing up? Let there be frogs. And there wasn't a frog in the country, but in one hour's time, there were 10 deep foot deep in places. What was it? It was God the creator hiding himself in a simple man. Now I want to ask you something. Now I want to ask you something. If the blood of a bull and a goat be used for a bleach which can only cover would put a man in a position to speak the creative word of God. and bring flies into existence. Why would you stumble at the bleach of Jesus Christ? His blood which could speak a squirrel or something into existence. What I'm talking about has happened in our day. Brother Bham under the bleach of the blood of Jesus he spoke squirrels into existence. Squirrels be here one here. If you've never heard about it, hear it tonight. Go and research about it. William man who God used. He died in 1965. He created Skittles as Moses created flogs and other things. But where does the potential come from? It is in in that bridge. The other bridge. That bridge. You're no longer under the seat. You are on the other side of the c when you are restored in power, in authority, in ability. Where are your words? They are God's words. Amen. And your thoughts are the thoughts of God. create something and it comes into existence. Many times at home without money and have no food. When the month is starting, I give my wife a monthly budget. I look for the money and I give it to her. Sometimes people the money gets finished. I tell her don't return. Make sure the money is enough. Now if it is not she has to die with it many times comes the other day came what is happening he said do you know what God has created money you mean it said yes I didn't have money I didn't know what to tell you I said God create And he she forgot but she had already spoken the word when she went back to check there was money not once not twice you may see and think we are rich by what I'm saying hallelujah the creative power is already bride. It is there that authority. It has been given us because we were arrested the authority. Now if you're going through a situation if you still love it, it is up to you. The authority is not without The authorities with you tired of bad situation have the revelation when you speak a word come out of the mouth of God, the way you've spoken, it will come to pass. They under you. You know, even even soothsayers, they proclaim because they know that there is power in the world. The devil knows it. There's a power in the world doing all those things and they make sacrifices the sacrifice must be made sacrif then they begin prophesying from today hence forth so and so you will suffer then all your doors has closed. May you suffer you not get peace. I've spoken it so and so you will suffer. And then you see somebody suffering because gave a sacrifice and spoke a word. Where does the devil get them from? That is what I'm preaching. But you don't want to believe it. And no, [Music] that is the third pool you hear about. The third pool is the word. The word must bear fruits of the word. That is a higher level of the ordinary miracles. That is not the show. But the world is going to see children have been restored if they know who they are. Hallelujah. Now after the sacrifice for the sacrifice is not of not of sheep. The sacrifice is above all sacrifices. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the sacrifice prophesy again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes sir. That is why the Bible says the book is open but it is still closed amongst men. But he says But in the grace of the valley when he begins to speak the mystery of God shall be finished. It didn't stop there. The seventh angel has already come. We have believed him. We accepted a message. It is what we eat. It is what we believe. But after eating and feeding, he says, "It is time to prophesy." Give me the verse. When I speak the scriptures, give them to us. It is the 11th chapter from verse 8. And thou shall prophesy again among many people and nations time. Hallelujah. And the voice which I heard from heaven to me again spake again unto me. Speak again unto me. And he said, take the reader book. Take the reader book. Take the deed. Take the authority. Take the power. Take your true identity. Receive your true origin. Receive your abstract tit all the way to the beginning. Hallelujah. Take the little book. This book is open now. Amen. Amen. in the hand of the angel. And what are you going to do? Give me the next verse. And I went unto the angel. Somebody should come to the angel this morning. And I went unto the angel. And I said unto him, you know what? We need to have people that really desire what I'm talking about. You won't be there and everything. They just beg you. I'm talking about it's not about those people there. It is for those who know who they are. Come to church. Come to church. You don't need to just be beaten. Revelation of God. They don't. They don't beg me. I know what I am. These are yours. This is this food belongs to those. When you go to the angel, it's not the angel going to say, "Please come. Are you getting it?" But you by revelation. Hallelujah. Angel, give me the book. Give me the book. Which angel? I wish I had another one hour. Friends, we have received an open book by the end of the seventh angel. The seventh angel is the prophet of our generation and he has preached the message. It's not his message. It is a title deed which he received open by the lamp revealed it. What is it? It's the book of redemption. What is it? Is the abstract title deal. It shows your true origin authority you have. Everything that Adam lost. Everything is restored to you. When you eat this message, when you eat the message, you read the message. Eating is reading and listening. Stop listening to those joking things in your homes. throw them out. Some of you are buying DSTV. It's a waste of time. The bride is somewhere. She's being she's eating from something nobody knows about. Get into the message, brother. Every day, every week, listen to something. Every eat something in your home as an individual. If you don't have those books or those sermons, ask we shall give you read the Bible, read the message. This is the open book. And when you eat it, when you eat it, when you eat it, then you come to a moment, you become crazy and give me the book. And he said it, "Take it. Take it. Eat it up." And that's what he has done. He taped it. Take it. Here is the message. Eat it up. And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be th in thy mouth sweet as. It will rearrange everything in you. correct everything, clean everything up. And now go to verse 10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and I ate it up and it was my mouth. My mouth sweet as honey. Isn't this message sweet? And as soon as I had eaten it, amen, my belly was bitter. Come on, brother. And he said unto me, thou must prophesy. Oh, amen. You are not like the other prophecies. They are susayers. Even those that they prophesying, they not prophesying anything because they don't have a message. They don't have the open book. The seven seals to them. They are still covered and closed. Some things I've spoken tonight, others have not gotten. Come back, come back, come back, come back. Get the messages and read. When you understand, you will get mad the way I am. Amen. Then now you're going to prophesy. That is where you will see men and women who know the authority they have when they prophesying prophesying. They no longer lead the man of God anointed man. You know the things they do for that one. I was very bad but the man of God I was bad. a man of God. I was battling a man of God. Now fine that is fine. But today this message it takes you from there and takes you somewhere now. Now it is no longer in the man of God. It is in the men and women. Hallelujah. The authority has been given to everyone that has been redeemed and restored. They can prophesy today. I am today. Let me tell you when you get the revelation, you will speak in prophecy. The prophecy spoken and anointing, it can never fail. You won't just prophesy to that person. You will prophesy unto everybody. That is where we are. When you know where you came from and where you going, that is the level you're supposed to be at. Let us stand on our feet. Hallelujah. Amen.
