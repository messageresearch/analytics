whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them welcome i'd like to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ my name is evening i just want i just have a small uh subject to speak on congress i want to speak about a blind generation to the [Music] [Music] it's not only this generation it's also all the generations before this generation america the the generations before us and even now it's been blinded to the fulfillment of prophecy a million and the holy spirit can be able to flow very well and we all can be able to connect to him am i speaking to somebody tonight it won't hurt if you respond every now and then so these generations and whenever god does something the people do not see what he is doing then at that moment they are usually so much in love with being able to recognize what god was doing and what god will do but not what god is doing but we want to be a generation that will be able to see the fulfillment of prophecy if there is one thing that is so bad is to be blind [Music] if you are blind you cannot be able to see the beauty of the things that god created [Music] if you are blind you cannot be able to see the beautiful flowers if you are blind you cannot know that there is yellow black red and blue you cannot even know purple yellow and green why because you are blind blind only knows black and dark oh yeah that's why it is so bad to be blind and now that is if physical blindness is that bad much more spiritual blindness the subject i'm speaking on actually was inspired by my sharing with him amen we are talking about blindness my subject is a blind generation to the fulfillment of prophecy you see and i was speaking about a physical blind man or woman if you are blind you cannot be able to see the beauty that god has made you see if you look around now you'll be able to see green the green flowers and then you know everything oh you will love it you know people go out to the beach maybe to rest a while and they go in the wild maybe to just enjoy their nature you see that kind of going out cannot be as as enterprising without your ability to see now [Music] it is more beautiful it is more real if you can see the beauty and then you will be able to understand [Music] you know they will not be able to see the kingdom of god if not born again you see they cannot be able to see that means to understand [Applause] to be blind he robs you of the ability that god intended for the humankind that is what we call spiritual blindness people all over the generations have had spiritual blindness around 2 million [Music] he's like you are cast you're doomed forever and we see here in the book we baptism in the name of our lord [Music] has blinded the mind the only reason why someone would be spiritually blinded and sooner you could achievement [Applause] he wants them all to come to the full do you know what happened to them in the power of the arena it was good childhood that the gospel be brought to you fast but because you have rejected it hallelujah amen in holiness and righteousness we believe in the holy amen what is it [Music] [Music] is oh such men [Music] just read a question of a quote from the message israel and the church god is what must every time be fulfilled you think you are getting by but just remember young man it's going to grind [Music] [Music] jesus okay if what you used to know hallelujah forever [Music] because now you can make yourself right your i am not preaching is the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god the scriptures right here the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare yes the way of the lord and man for our god amen i want to ask you a question what did the scripture say what you gonna be a voice where is it crying from it from the wilderness from the palace from the temple from a big church from where wilderness [Music] [Music] gonna do show us that voice save you this man i don't know about it john the baptist was a son of one of the priests did you hear that but what did he do i said did you hear that day john the baptist was a son of zechariah he said again not the prophet read it by the priest the priest was blind the priest was blind so spiritually not physical are you following me and the age of the lord spoke to him if you don't said it elizabeth knew that she had a promised child in the womb [Music] and elizabeth knew that even if the child looked dead there is a promise the [Music] [Music] [Music] and then [Music] you know the mother was like but but dear name let us leave the boy to leave his name i want this boy to be a priest like me what am i talking about but god did not want him to be a blessing god had other would you credit baker and uh and uh you know jacob neyakobo and uh essa you know that story there was something one way to go that [Music] is are you is [Applause] [Music] we don't know what exactly happened there's too many teachers to come see maybe the mother was aware about johnny's disappearance to the wife of my boyfriend [Music] but hallelujah [Music] when the mother saw him [Music] foreign um whoever believed john was a rascal chris hallelujah what a fulfillment of prophecy and when he spoke he spoke the [Music] [Music] [Applause] but because because their eyes were blinded by the eyes of an understanding we be able to see the prophecy prophecy and here comes another prophet for unto us a child is born and to ask a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsel of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace commander manager oman orbitals hallelujah what does the prophecy say abundant all of us together so now i'm for unto us i shall read that again child and his name shall be called wonderful cancer the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace so all that would be his name would it be everlasting is maybe they never a child is born [Music] yes [Music] spiritual blindness [Music] b is [Applause] you we see together that the star dominion appeared yeah just like stars appeared in our generation and we are following that story they followed that [Music] it a moment here to ticket by that time israel was under the rulership of rome [Music] the roman empire at that time was ruling they were seeing him as their savior from the bondage of rome that's what they believe so the romans knew about the prophecy [Music] and they [Music] so we can also go ahead these men walked away and when they reached the place but i had to communicate the pharisees also my father told them tell us but actually the pharisees i'm afraid i don't [Laughter] but because they maybe had their own vaginas they had [Music] and that's how they they went to the king again and the king told them like that they were confused let me tell you come on whenever you leave they start you get confused all right i'm approaching the finishing line here and so i walked by and walked and walked appeared they were excited for the prophet he sent today [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] the the shepherds who were singing passing cannabis right i don't remember but maybe they did oh they're about singing they were also there and spoke to them now you'll get another and say it is born again you know jesus always comes to the despise the bible says that he reveals that he hid himself from the wise and the prudent of the world and he he revealed himself [Music] so if this message is true why is it that all the bishops in busy pentecost and there and even in the catholic church what why is that how they know him right you don't have to know god reveals himself you mean if we many preachers are forced to i [Music] is [Applause] oh [Applause] you [Music] hallelujah amen my friends conclusions [Music] every lips were drawing down [Music] the money the boy can preach like a manga like nobody else has god [Applause] hallelujah another eyes are finished in the scriptures that is why i am blind oh [Applause] amen [Music] praise amen because jesus stand up on your feet and praise [Music] hallelujah give me i'll never forget i'll never forget [Applause] oh oh [Music] [Music] is hey man [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] so [Music] [Music] not even as we are going to give our offerings and tithes now come on guys i pray that you bless all the givers may you help us that we may serve you with all our substances for the glory of god yes god bless you and all those who have been online [Music] [Music] [Music] that i can see
