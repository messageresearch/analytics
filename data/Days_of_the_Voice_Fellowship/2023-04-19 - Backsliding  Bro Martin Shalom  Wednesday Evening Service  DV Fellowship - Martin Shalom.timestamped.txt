[32:52] are increased how shall I pardon thee
[32:56] for this
[32:58] thy children are forsaken me and sworn
[33:01] by them that are not gods when I heard

[33:09] they then committed adultery and
[33:12] assembled themselves by troops in the
[33:15] Hollywood's house
[33:32] foreign
[33:54] [Music]

[34:16] window we thank you for the reading of
[34:19] the world
[34:21] Lord you know how weak I am come on
[34:26] how insufficient I Am Lord
[34:30] and why the Lord open this the pages of
[34:33] this book
[34:36] pray that may the blood of Jesus
[34:51] in Jesus
[34:57] we are reading another scripture in the
[35:00] book of Hosea foreign
[35:26] he says this and my people are bent
[35:29] to backsliding from me
[35:32] though they call them to the most high
[35:36] none at all would exalt him
[35:40] how shall I give thee up Ephraim
[35:44] how shall I deliver thee Israel how
[35:48] shall I make thee as
[35:50] asthma how shall I set thee as zebon my
[35:56] heart is turned within me my repentance
[36:00] are kindled together
[36:03] foreign
[36:43] blessed in the name of the Lord
[36:46] this evening
[36:50] I will call my text backsliding
[37:00] praise be to God
[37:03] it may not be backsliding as in uh maybe
[37:07] committing sin like maybe falling in our
[37:10] adultery idolatry Queens
[37:16] Linda
[37:19] also it's a monk
[37:22] that's part of it also
[37:27] but mainly
[37:29] we are going to look at the conditions
[37:36] blessed in the name of the Lord
[37:39] and backsliding
[37:42] it means
[37:46] to move back America
[37:51] I remember last time we shared about
[37:53] being washful
[37:55] not to be not uh not to drift
[38:00] um
[38:05] and you know drifting
[38:10] it's not like
[38:12] a sudden movement
[38:14] it is not something which happens very
[38:18] rapidly blessed the name of the Lord but
[38:22] realize drifting
[38:24] in something that's happened slowly
[38:29] and by the time you realize
[38:33] you are very far
[38:36] blessed in the name of the Lord
[38:38] and here we are seeing God speaking to
[38:41] Israel
[38:43] where we have read in Hosea
[38:46] that is chapter 11 verses 7.
[38:51] and my people are bent to backsliding
[38:54] from me
[39:00] amen Mina and we are living in the time
[39:07] when the charge is backsliding
[39:13] the church is drifting from their
[39:15] grounds
[39:20] amen are this happening gradually
[39:24] [Music]
[39:26] that's why the Bible tells us to watch
[39:29] and be vigilance
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] what shall we pray
[39:38] amen the prophet says that we backslide
[39:42] every day
[39:46] blessed with the name of the Lord but
[39:49] the backsliding I'm looking at tonight
[39:53] is where we are drifting from our
[39:56] positions
[39:57] [Music]
[39:59] where we are moving us from the first
[40:02] love
[40:03] [Music]
[40:04] blessed with the name of the Lord and
[40:07] remember even in scriptures
[40:10] where God is rebuking the first church
[40:14] the church
[40:16] and the prophet says
[40:20] it's a compound word meaning
[40:26] it means together
[40:29] aiming
[40:40] I'm looking for it somewhere here
[40:49] blessed with the name of the Lord
[40:58] I believe I'll see it
[41:03] and relaxed
[41:08] [Music]
[41:09] blessed the name of the Lord
[41:12] rebuking them
[41:14] he's telling them to go back to the
[41:17] first love
[41:19] and he told them about
[41:21] I have someone against you
[41:24] amen man
[41:30] go back
[41:32] that you to the first love
[41:35] and what is the first love
[41:38] Jesus said I'm the alpha and the Omega
[41:41] yes
[41:43] these people they were aiming
[41:46] [Music]
[41:48] that but some of their dreams and they
[41:51] relaxed
[41:53] and God became concerned
[41:56] and he rebuked them and told them repent
[42:01] and go back the first language
[42:06] in the first way back is repentance
[42:11] the only way we can go back the First
[42:14] Love Is by repentance
[42:18] and maybe by the end of this service
[42:21] we will shake ourselves and everybody
[42:25] will see
[42:27] where is one thing
[42:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[42:32] amen
[42:34] here he says that uh
[42:37] that my people bent to backslide from me
[42:42] again
[42:47] amen amen
[42:49] message Believers are
[42:52] the message Believers have determined to
[42:57] backslide from me
[43:00] every single day
[43:03] it draws Us near to the coming of the
[43:05] Lord
[43:08] and if the church which is going to be
[43:11] Rapture
[43:12] has to be in that same condition it was
[43:16] the first church was
[43:20] where are we living today
[43:23] how far have we moved to time the queen
[43:26] can achieve blessed with the name of the
[43:28] Lord amen
[43:30] [Applause]
[43:31] I am aware of God the material
[43:34] we have the message of preparation
[43:38] preparing us
[43:42] amen man every time we come in the
[43:45] service
[43:47] the world is preparing us
[43:50] bring us to Rapture conditions
[43:55] blessed with the name of the Lord you
[43:58] cannot induce
[44:02] foreign
[44:10] praise the Lord and if you're living in
[44:13] the Rapture time
[44:15] the church must be ready
[44:18] because Christ is ready because amen
[44:24] blessed with the name of the Lord in the
[44:27] message
[44:30] the prophet says that don't fed back
[44:33] into the very things that you came out
[44:36] of there
[44:39] you are drifting
[44:43] praise the Lord amen
[44:46] amen amen backsliding is drifting back
[44:52] [Music]
[44:54] moving back
[44:58] but remember Christians
[45:00] not supposed to be neutral
[45:03] um
[45:04] you don't have to be neutral ground
[45:09] either you were hurt
[45:13] but you cannot be neutral and in
[45:17] Christianity
[45:18] God expect us to move forward
[45:22] blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:25] amen amen laying aside everywhere
[45:28] being a side every sin
[45:31] running the rest which you said before
[45:34] around
[45:36] amen this is not the microphy calling
[45:41] there is
[45:43] Jesus Christ and that's where our Target
[45:47] is
[45:54] send me the name of the Lord amen man me
[45:59] now so God rebuked them
[46:01] here God is complaining
[46:04] God is telling them
[46:08] from me
[46:11] God is willing to walk with us
[46:15] God wants us to move forward
[46:18] but many times means the church want to
[46:23] stand straight
[46:24] and remember in scriptures
[46:33] amen the church has stayed in this
[46:36] condition for so long
[46:39] we are reading the word every day
[46:42] and we are contented
[46:45] but friends we are on the journey
[46:50] amen there's no we can pitch our tents
[46:54] here
[46:59] praise the Lord
[47:01] we are on our way
[47:04] when you are going somewhere
[47:08] if you are very important Journey
[47:12] you cannot move
[47:19] remember this is the race
[47:24] the minister uh home minister told us um
[47:29] he was talking about the race
[47:32] and he said we are the last restaurant
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] amen
[47:44] started
[47:47] to Luther yeah
[47:54] [Applause]
[48:02] if you look into that kind of race
[48:08] I think it's called five thousand meters
[48:16] nobody is given a stick
[48:20] and they ran and reach somewhere and
[48:23] then they sit down
[48:26] but it's very possible with the church
[48:34] sometimes things which are impossible
[48:35] with it
[48:36] physically they are possible spiritually
[48:39] [Music]
[48:45] blessed with the name of the Lord
[48:47] amen Amina but we better watch
[48:51] [Music]
[48:52] backsliding or going forward
[48:56] you ate the backslide
[49:01] forward
[49:02] in the message Jesus Christ the same
[49:04] yesterday today
[49:10] so God wants us to move forward
[49:18] he wants his church to grow
[49:21] he want us to move forward
[49:29] every time we hear the word
[49:32] we must act upon that word
[49:36] we must live according to that word amen
[49:43] this message still takes us back the
[49:45] first love we talked about
[49:49] because the first love is the Alpha and
[49:52] the first love is
[49:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:59] is not a position with God
[50:15] [Music]
[50:16] amen but don't go back to what we we
[50:20] should not go back to what we came from
[50:24] you know backsliding is funny

[51:42] blessed with the name of the Lord
[51:45] amen that is a sign of backsliding
[51:50] you are moving back slowly
[51:54] you find even clapping for the Lord is a
[51:57] heavy burden to you
[52:00] it may not be a big thing
[52:03] but God is interested in those small
[52:06] things you are doing
[52:10] you spend the whole week without praying
[52:14] you spend the whole day without even
[52:17] singing one song

[1:36:53] they thought to us with them
[1:36:56] they presumed that Jesus was following
[1:36:59] them
[1:37:02] to me that has been the evidence that
[1:37:04] they were it is true that our ears that
[1:37:08] is an evidence that they were not the
[1:37:11] parent of Jesus because when I walk with
[1:37:13] my daughter

[1:37:19] holding Joseph's hands on
[1:37:39] every three days

[1:37:46] he was so bound with the Father's Love
[1:37:49] Yes
