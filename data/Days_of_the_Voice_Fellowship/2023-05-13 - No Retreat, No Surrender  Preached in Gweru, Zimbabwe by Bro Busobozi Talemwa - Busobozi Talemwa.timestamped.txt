[48:25] [Music]
[48:26] but from the very message churches
[48:31] separating church members
[48:35] from the bone of his bones
[48:40] the secret love message
[48:45] written in between the lines
[48:49] the unwritten words
[48:54] revealed by The Grove
[48:59] Revelation 10 7 is the only way to catch

[49:44] the next song I'm going to sing is the
[49:46] one I just recently released called John
[49:48] 3 16 amen
[49:50] it was inspired from the book the bridge
[49:53] between the seven Shades ages and the
[49:55] Seven Seals amen
[50:02] [Music]
[50:13] thank you
[50:19] [Music]
[50:24] [Applause]
[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:34] I can hear the voice of God Walking In
[50:38] The Garden on his way to see his son
[50:43] at the usual meeting place he finds no
[50:47] one there then he calls out his name
[50:51] [Music]
[50:55] oh where are you
[51:03] oh where are you
[51:09] when I demonstrate God realizes the
[51:14] damage has already been done
[51:17] the price of sin is death there's no
[51:21] other way his son and daughter now have
[51:24] to die
[51:26] the law required a sacrifice and no man
[51:31] was able to be the requirement but God
[51:36] accepted a substituted to tie in their
[51:40] place
[51:42] now I can hear
[51:45] please
[51:47] lamb
[51:51] or the day to cover up this
[51:58] thing oh but that was not enough the
[52:02] blood of animals it only covered up
[52:06] their sin but it could not wash them
[52:10] clean so they were separated no more
[52:14] fellowship with God had lost the title
[52:19] Deeds to
[52:21] eternal life and the inheritance
[52:25] they could not redeem themselves it had
[52:29] to be another
[52:33] an angel could not do it though they had
[52:37] not said it simply had to be a man
[52:41] that's why God condescended into human
[52:46] flesh a permanent solution to see him
[52:50] now you ask yourself
[52:53] why would God concern himself with you
[52:59] when it simply can create another person
[53:07] just like yours
[53:12] but God still love the world he did not
[53:16] create another one but he made a way
[53:22] back to him by the shedding of his Royal
[53:27] Blood now if you understand this story
[53:33] you will see all my she loves you if you
[53:38] can only hear his voice you can enter it
[53:46] God so loved the world he did not create
[53:51] another one
[53:54] but he made a way back to him by the
[53:58] shedding off his Royal Blood
[54:02] now if you understand this story
[54:10] loves you
[54:11] if you can only hear
[54:13] his voice you can enter in
[54:18] foreign
[54:22] his voice you can enter in
[54:26] God bless you the Lord

[1:44:41] and bless the reading of the word
[1:44:44] so this is our last service
[1:44:48] and so let us make use of it
[1:44:51] amen amen I told you if you preach with
[1:44:55] me
[1:44:55] then the holy spirit will use me
[1:44:59] and we won't have to worry about my
[1:45:01] Broken Voice
[1:45:04] The Way You Preach with me is if you
[1:45:05] hear the word just say amen amen
[1:45:12] foreign so this morning
[1:45:14] last night I just
[1:45:17] see past aside I came with a lot of
[1:45:20] preparations
[1:45:22] I had enough summons to preach
[1:45:26] but see everything I came with
[1:45:29] I preached nothing out of it
[1:45:32] and so what I'm going to preach to you
[1:45:34] today was an inspiration which came to
[1:45:37] me last night
[1:45:40] and our inspiration is always within the
[1:45:42] message
[1:45:44] we don't have another inspiration out of
[1:45:48] the message
[1:45:50] praise the name of the Lord and so I was
[1:45:53] thinking about Jesus
[1:45:55] you know how today is a resurrection
[1:45:58] morning
[1:46:00] and Jesus rose again
[1:46:03] but do you know when the battle gets the
[1:46:06] hottest
[1:46:07] just when Victory is about to come
[1:46:11] but where Victory is about to cast
[1:46:14] that's when the devil speaks louder
[1:46:18] and the devil doesn't speak from the
[1:46:21] outside
[1:46:22] but the devil begins to speak from the
[1:46:24] inside
[1:47:22] and there was
[1:47:44] but not because everything was lost
[1:47:47] because because there was something new
[1:47:50] going to come forward
[1:47:52] and Jesus yes I wondered why was he
[1:47:57] crying
[1:48:00] because he fear death
[1:48:04] Hallelujah let us not spiritualize
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:49:15] he moved away
[1:49:18] he
[1:49:32] did not want to die
[1:49:35] he feared
[1:49:41] he was a man just like
[1:49:44] and I believe at that moment
[1:49:47] many thoughts might have been going
[1:49:49] through it
[1:49:51] they never must have told him do you
[1:49:54] know what you can give this up
[1:49:58] you don't have to die
[1:50:03] how can you imagine think that you would
[1:50:06] die for the whole world
[1:50:39] so out of that okay
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:15] hallelujah hallelujah praise God let me
