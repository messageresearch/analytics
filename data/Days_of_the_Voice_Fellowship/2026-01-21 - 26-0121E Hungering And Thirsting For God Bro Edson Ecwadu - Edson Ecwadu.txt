We as the church, we we as a bride, we should never at any time accept to be caught up in some of these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, like I mean, don't let it take the better part of you. You know, I know there are people who have died, people who have lost their mind, others who became sick, maybe because, you know, the person they were supporting did not, you know, so if you're one of those, we I'm so sorry, but you know, I just want to encourage you. Don't lose hope. Have hope in Christ. Bam said, "I voted once when he voted Jesus. He voted all but in all things we thank God and we give all the glory.

I've stood here like two or three times. Yeah. Well, it's been a while since I want to appreciate pastor for giving me this opportunity to come and testify. I usually say this. I don't consider myself a preacher. I just testify what the Lord has put in my heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if you came expecting a mighty man of God, well, you might be disappointed because I'm just going to speak something very simple, a testimony. Praise the Lord. Do you love the Lord? Yeah, I'm going to uh read from the book of Psalms. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here with my wife. &gt;&gt; She's over there. You can welcome her. I'm called brother Edson. I come from Teso and I stay in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you are seeing me for the first time, then you are the vista in DVF. Praise the Lord. Because this is the first church I attended. The very first time I came to camp. Praise the Lord. Well, I've been away for a while, &gt;&gt; but I've come back home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms chapter 42, &gt;&gt; versh. Well, I don't know how long I'm going to preach. I don't know what uh what time is always given on Wednesday. Okay, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we read in the name of the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; As the heart pants after the waterbrooks, so pants my soul after you, oh God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? Precious father, we have read your word. The same word tells us that letter kills but the spirit gives. It's our prayer that may you come and inspire this also inspire me. Oh God that Lord let the spirit speak. If there is anything that I've prepared, put it aside, may you come and speak to me because you know their desires. I do not know but Lord I know you know. Speak to somebody who desires. Blessed be your majesty. Grant it father to the glory of your name in Jesus mighty and precious. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. I'm going to speak uh on hungering and thirsting for God. It might have ever been preached. It might have been preached here before. I do not know. But with God, things are always new. I believe it's not the first time you're hearing that scripture. It might have been read several days. But always God has a new thought. Praise the Lord. God wants you to thirst for him. It is God's desire that we thirst. And as a believer, you should thraise the Lord. You should have a desire deep down your soul. Something that is desiring for God, something that pushes you to know more of God, that should push you to Christ. That thirst is there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we should try to fulfill it in the way that God has purposed it. Now this scripture says that as the heart pants after the water, so my soul pants after you says here in the message thirst. He says God wants you to thirst for him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As they had punted for the waterbrook, so my soul thirst after thee of God. Now if the deer was pinging for the waterbrook, what if some somebody came along? Another bad deer could come along and say, I tell you what, I know where there is a mud hole down there. Well, &gt;&gt; the deer wouldn't want that. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't want He wouldn't It wouldn't do him any good. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't do him any good. &gt;&gt; This deer is thirsting for water, not for the M, but it's it's thirsting for the water. Somebody came along and wanted to introduce something new to him. Well, that would not be able to quench a thirst. Brother says it would not do him any good. You are thirsting after God. There's a thirst inside of you, something that is thirsting for God, something that is desiring for God. God has put that IN EVERYONE. ALL OF you here, you've got a thirst. And that thirst, you are supposed to thirst after God. But when what the devil does is to come and pervert the thirst. Hallelujah. HE COMES TO PERVERT IT, TRYING TO make you fulfill, trying to MAKE YOU QUENCH THE THIRST AFTER God with the things of the world. Praise the Lord. That is why you find people drinking themselves They are trying to fulfill. They are trying to LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL QUENCH THAT RIGHT thing that God has put in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You find people. Men are not satisfied WITH ONE WIFE. WHY? THERE IS SOMETHING LACKING. THEY ARE THIRSTING. BUT I THINK BY marrying many, THEY WILL QUENCH THAT BLESSED THIRST THAT GOD HAS PUT IN THEM. WELL, when you do that, you only MAKE MATTERS WORSE. God puts that thirst in you so that you draw close to him BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOD WHO HAS GOT A SUBSTANCE THAT CAN QUENCH THAT THIRST. HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS GOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DESIRE THAT WILL GIVE YOU PEACE. You do not have peace. GOD HAS PURPOSED IT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE peace so that you can find PEACE IN HIM BECAUSE he's the fountain of peace. People try to look for something that they think intellectually that is a SOLUTION TO THE PAST THAT GOD has put in. AND THE DEVIL DOES THAT. PRAISE THE LORD. SATAN CANNOT CREATE A BUT HE PERVERTS THE RIGHTEOUS THING THAT God has chosed be the name of the Lord Jesus. Satan poverts he does not have the power to CREATE BUT HE COMES WITH HIS EVIL POWER TO PERVERT THE right thing that GOD HAS CREATED. BLESSED BE THE name of the Lord Jesus. That's why people are meandering IN THE WORLD. WHAT ARE THEY looking for? THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TRY TO QUENCH THE BLESSED THIRST THAT GOD HAS PUT. WELL, I tell you church, today that thirst should drive you to Christ that God has PUT IN YOU, A program that God HAS ESTABLISHED IN YOU THAT YOU MAY RUN BACK TO HIM. YOU are not supposed to RUN AWAY FROM HIM. THAT FIRST HAS BEEN PUT THERE. RUN BACK TO GOD. HE'S GOT THE REMEDY. He's got the solution. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. We've got to thirst after God, not after the things of the world. Hallelujah. If you thirst for God, don't shake hands with a preacher and put your name on the book. If you are thirsting for God, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO SATISFY IT. TO MEET GOD. PRAISE THE LORD. IF YOU ARE THIRSTING FOR GOD TONIGHT, MARRYING ANOTHER WIFE cannot satisfy it. Marrying a second wife cannot satisfy. Drinking alcohol cannot help you. Praise the Lord. Running to another church cannot help you. Meeting a preacher cannot help you. Hallelujah. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SATISFY THE ONLY THING THAT CAN QUENCH THE THIRST IS COMING IN CONTACT WITH GOD. Praise the Lord. If you have a feeling in your heart, there is SOMETHING LACKING IN YOUR LIFE. THERE IS something lacking. IF YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS LACKING IN YOU. WELL, I TELL YOU TODAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING to do. IF YOU WANT TO FIND PEACE, IF YOU WANT TO FIND A TEST, RUN TO THE Christ because he has got a solution. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. You are thirsting for God. The only way you can meet him is to do that. The only way you can quench that thirst is to meet God. That's when you'll find peace. THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL FIND REMEDY. THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND A SOLUTION. WHEN YOU MEET CHRIST, YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. WHEN YOU MEET GOD, YOU WILL NEVER THIRST AGAIN BECAUSE CHRIST IS THE SATISFACTION OF YOUR SOUL. HE'S EVERYTHING YOU GOT. HE'S ALL THAT YOU NEED. Praise the Lord. Stop running around, brother. Stop running around, sister. You need to meet Christ. You need to meet God. Your thirst may be quenched. There was a man in the Bible in the names of Job. Well, sometimes God gives us a trial that so that we will know. He is the only one who can solve our problem. Job chapter 23 from verses one. Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord? Give the Lord a mighty hand of praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Job chapter 23 from verses one. Are we there church? Then Job answered and said, "Even today is my complaint bitter. My stroke is heavier than my groaning." Great. We know that Job was in a trial and he went through difficult time that I believe none of us here has got blessed be the name of the Lord. He said my complaint trouble HOW I FEEL THE PAIN THAT I'M GOING THROUGH IS GREATER THAN THE WAY YOU ARE seeing me growing. HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS, "ALL THAT I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM. IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND GOD. IF I COULD DISCOVER WHERE HE'S HIDING, IF I KNEW WHERE I COULD FIND HIM, HALLELUJAH, I MIGHT COME EVEN TO HIS SEAT." Is that your desire tonight? If Hebrews says, "Come to the THRONE OF GRACE. COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN WHAT? MERCY. THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN MERCY. DO YOU DESIRE MERCY TONIGHT? COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE. IF YOU ARE DESIRING MERCY, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE DRAWN AWAY FROM GOD, WHEN THERE'S AN INVITATION TODAY, COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN MERCY. HOW MANY NEED MERCY TODAY? HERE I TELL YOU, CHURCH IS MERCY. THE BIBLE TELLS US HIS MERCIES HIS MERCIES ARE NEW TO US EVERY MORNING. GOD HAS GOT NEW MERCIES FOR YOU EVERY DAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY. HE HAS GOT A NEW MERCY. HE HAS GOT A NEW MERCY FOR YOU FOR EVERY DAY. Come to the throne of grace that you may obtain mercy. Not only mercy, you know what? But also grace. THE GRACE. THE GRACE TO help in time of needs. It is only grace that can help you in your TIME OF NEED. WHERE DO WE FIND GRACE? COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE. IF YOU DESIRE GRACE, COME TO THE THRONE OF grace that you may find grace. to help in the time that you need it. IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE I could find. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT COME EVEN to his seat, Job knew that when he comes to the seat of God, come to God. &gt;&gt; When you COME TO THE SEAT, OF GOD. YOU HAVE COME TO THE presence of God. AND WHEN YOU COME to the PRESENCE OF GOD, I TELL YOU, CHURCH, you will never go back the same. Your life will never be the same. HE SAID, "COME UNTO ME ALL YE WHO LABOR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN. WHAT WILL I DO?" HE DIDN'T SAY, "I WILL JUDGE YOU." NO, SIR. HE SAID, "I WILL GIVE YOU REST." AMEN. What is that you're looking for tonight? God has got rest for your soul. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. HE SAID, "I WOULD ORDER MY COURSE BEFORE HIM and fill my mouth with arguments." What is that? He would speak TO GOD. HE WOULD TELL HIM WHO HE IS. HE WOULDN'T HIDE ANYTHING. SPEAK TO GOD. They would tell you know I am Edison. You know I lasted yesterday. You know I told a LIE I CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU. I HAVE COME JUST THE WAY I AM. I HAVE REALIZED ONE THING. I NEED YOU. WITHOUT YOU I AM GOING TO PERISH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AS THE HEART PED FOR WATERPROOF AS MY SOUL PSYTHER YOU FIND HIM OR YOU PERISH. Praise the Lord. IT'S A BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. The moment you know, THE MOMENT YOU DISCOVER THAT IF YOU DON'T FIND CHRIST, YOU ARE GOING TO PERISH. Then you will thirst. YOU WILL HUNGER FOR HIM. YOU WILL LOOK FOR HIM. YOU DESIRE FOR HIM. AND WHEN YOU DESIRE FOR HIM, you will be found. You will find him because God is available. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. He says, I WILL BLEED. HE SAYS, "I WOULD KNOW THE WORDS which he would answer me." WHAT A MOMENT that you COME BEFORE GOD AND TELL HIM who you are. Complain. Tell him who you are. JUST AS THE OTHER WOMAN, HANNAH, WENT AND SPOKE TO GOD. SHE WENT AND SPOKE HER AT. HALLELUJAH. WHAT DID GOD DO TO HER? DID HE CHASE HER WAY? NO. AH HE GRANTED THAT DESIRE. JOHN SAID I WOULD TELL HIM WHO I AM. I WOULD TELL HIM I WOULD FILL MY MOUTH WITH ARGUMENTS. AFTER telling him what happens I will know the words which he will answer. Well when you speak to Christ the proof that you are speaking to me he should be able to answer you BY WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM. OUR GOD IS NOT DEAD. IS A LIVING GOD. WHAT'S THE PROOF THAT HE'S ALIVE? HE ALWAYS SPEAKS BACK. YOU SPEAK TO HIM. HE SPEAKS BACK TO YOU. IT'S A SIGN THAT GOD IS ALIVE. GOD DOES NOT KEEP QUIET. HE TALKS TALKS TALK. IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD HIM, IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD GOD SPEAK, you have not yet gone to the throne to HIS SEAT. THOUGHT THEY HAVE FOUND HIM. WHEN YOU FIND HIS SPIRIT AND YOU SPEAK TO HIM, HE WILL SPEAK. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. Do you love the Lord? Give the Lord a shout of praise. He said, "I would know the words which he would answer and understand what he would say to me. Church, we've got to understand. It's one thing to know, it's another thing to understand. Praise the Lord. YOU CAN KNOW ED. THIS IS HIM. You know Ed because you are seeing me, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. SO IT'S ONE THING to know, it's another thing to understand. PRAISE THE LORD. JOB SAID I WOULD KNOW THE WORDS. ONE, know the words. Know the words of the Lord, the words that have spoken. WHEN YOU HAVE KNOWN THE WORDS, seek understanding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You cannot you cannot follow the instructions of God. Even if they have been given to you, you cannot be able to follow the instructions until you have understood. Amen. Praise the Lord. YOU CAN NEVER FOLLOW CHRIST UNTIL YOU have understood Christ. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MANY PEOPLE READ THE same Bible that Yes. BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. NO WONDER THEY CANNOT WALK and they read. Why? It's because they don't understand. One time there WAS A MAN CALLED PHILIP. He was moving and he met somebody. He was reading the Bible and he asked him, "Do you understand what you're reading? HOW WILL I UNDERSTAND UNTIL unless somebody explains it to you?" You will never understand until something has been explained. You say, "I will understand what you would say." Is that your desire that you want TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD SPEAKS TO YOU RIGHT NOW? GOD MIGHT BE SPEAKING. YOU ARE HEARING GOD SPEAKING, BUT SOME MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, but God is speaking. BUT SOME might not understand. Deuteronomy 29:29 THE SECRET THINGS BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR God then I can understand blessed be the name of the Lord he said I would know which he would ANSWER ME YOU HAVE TOLD HIM YOUR SIN WHEN YOU HAVE CONFESSED YOUR SIN TO HIM IS HE going to plead against you to meet the pastor and when you meet THE MINISTER YOU SHARE A BROTHER, YOU ARE SCARED BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU HAVE SINNED AWAY YOUR DAYS OF GRACE. WELL, I TELL YOU, CHRIST HAS GOT MERCY. Come to the throne OF GRACE. IF ONLY I KNEW. IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE I COULD FIND HIM. I MIGHT COME INTO HIS SEAT. Praise the Lord. He says, will he bleed against me with his power? Hallelujah. The answer is there. He says no. Tell your neighbor no. God is not going to plead against you with his great heart. But what will he do, but he will put strength in me. Strength is for the weak. THE POWER OF GOD IS NOT FOR JUDGMENT. NO. What is it for? It is for strengthening the weak. God will put strength in you. Well, YOU NEED STRENGTH TONIGHT. COME TO HIS SEAT. GOD IS WAITING. HE'S EXPECTING YOU. AS THE SONG SAYS, OPEN WIDE ARE HIS ARMS OF GRACE. GOD IS EXPECTING YOU. IT'S NOT NEW. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SIN. IS NOT GOING TO SHOCK GOD. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BEFORE YOU COMMITTED IT, HE KNEW THAT YOU DO IT. IT'S NOTHING NEW. THERE'S NOTHING NEW BEFORE GOD. YOU'RE SCARED FOR NOTHING. GOD ALREADY KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO COME. IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE WHO MIGHT HAVE SINNED, if you backslid, if you drifted away, I want you to know, it is not a secret to God. God knows you. He knows WHAT YOU DO. WHETHER it is night, WHETHER IT IS DAY, WELL, there's an eye that is watching you. SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE DONE CHURCH LET ME TELL YOU MY BROTHER MY SISTER GOD IS fully aware he has got the details OF YOUR SIN AND you know what he's waiting FOR YOU TO COME THAT HE MIGHT DO WHAT? That he will judge you? No. He's not waiting FOR YOU TO JUDGE YOU. He's waiting FOR YOU TO COME THAT HE MAY PUT strength in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why do you STAY WITH YOUR WEAKNESS? WHY DO YOU SIT ON your weakness when there IS GRACE? WHEN THERE IS MERCY, when God is waiting, when he's expecting you, when you are the one delaying your blessing, it is you who is DELAYING YOUR VICTORY. God is waiting. He's seated ON HIS SEAT. WAITING FOR YOU TO COME AND TELL HIM BY YOURSELF. IT SHOULD NOT BE THE PASTOR AND REPORT YOU TO GOD. NO. GOD DOES NOT TAKE secondary information. God is waiting for you. He's waiting for the CONFESSION OF YOUR MOUTH. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. It will show that you are remorseful. And when he gets that, he will not judge you. No, he will put strength in you. And when he put strength in you, you will overcome. If you HAVE NOT BEEN PRAYERFUL, COME TO THE SEAT, GET YOUR STRENGTH and go and trouble the devil. Blessed be the name of the LORD JESUS. GOD IS COUNTING ON YOU. HE'S NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE YOU are weak. God is not going to look FOR ANOTHER ONE STRONG. HE'S LOOKING for the weak to strengthen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's looking for you, that weak one. &gt;&gt; That's the one he wants to manifest his power through. He wants to strengthen you. THEN PEOPLE WILL TESTIFY. THE BIBLE says well, when when there is therefore an opportunity, do good unto all men, especially those in the household of faith, leave that one alone. Is where THE BIBLE SPEAKS. HE SAYS THAT LET YOUR LIGHT SO SHINE BEFORE MEN THAT THEY WILL SEE YOUR GOOD WORKS and thank you. NO GLORIFY YOU. NO. AND DO WHAT? GLORIFY GOD BECAUSE IT IS GOD WHO HAS DONE IT. HALLELUJAH. God is waiting for the weak. THEY WILL KNOW THAT SURELY WE KNOW THAT BOY. IS GOD. THE EDISON WE KNEW 10 YEARS AGO is not the one we know. Sure. IT IS GOD. WHATEVER GOD DOES, HE WANTS TO GET THE GLORY TO HIM. EVERYTHING THAT GOD DOES. EVERYTHING THAT GOD DOES, HE DOES IT FOR ONE PURPOSE. THAT YOU MAY COLLECT THE GLORY FOR HIMSELF. IT IS FOR HIMSELF. GOD WILL PUT STRENGTH IN YOU. I MAY GET THE GLORY JUDGE YOU NOW BECAUSE THE DEVIL WILL REJOICE. THE DEVIL WILL REJOICE WHEN GOD JUDGES YOU. YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS warned about the WORD GOING TO COME AND PUT THE CONVICTION IN YOU. FATHER, DON'T IGNORE THAT VOICE. DON'T IGNORE that conviction. It is God WHO IS CALLING YOU. NO MATTER HOW WEAK YOU ARE, GOD IS CALLING YOU SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART. MY SON, MY DAUGHTER, I AM WHEN HE PUT STRENGTH IN YOU, it will be a bomb to the devil. The devil will be ashamed and he will take your his dirty fingers off your life. When is he going to plead against YOU WITH HIS GREAT POWER? He will put strength in you. Blessed be the name of Jesus. verses eight. He says, "Behold, I go forward, but it's not there and backward, I cannot perceive you." THIS MAN WAS THIRSTING FOR GOD. I was LOOKING FOR GOD. YOU IF ONLY I COULD FIND HIM, my problems are over. If I could find God, my weakness is over. If I could find God, this lasting is gone. If I could find God, his gossiping is gone. If I could find God, his prayerlessness is gone. If I could find God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I go forward, &gt;&gt; but he's not there and backward, but I cannot pass on the left hand where he does work, but I cannot BEHOLD HIM. HE HIDES HIMSELF ON THE RIGHT HAND. BUT I CANNOT SEE HIM. But this is the thing, brother. This is the thing, sister. This is what you going to go back to. Listen to this, my brother. He knows the way that I take you. Praise the Lord. You might not see God in your life, but he's seeing you. You might not feel him. The Bible says he's a high priest WHO IS TOUCHED BY WHAT you feel. HE'S TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF INFIRMITY. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE GOD, BUT HE'S SEEING YOU. YOU CANNOT HIDE. HE KNOWS EACH TEAR THAT FALLS. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE KNOWS THE BURDEN IN YOUR HEART. HE KNOWS THE DESIRE OF YOUR HEART. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. EVEN BEFORE YOU ASK HIM, he knows it. He knows the way that I take you. God knows the way that YOU TAKE. I want to TELL YOU CHURCH, HE KNOWS IT. HE KNOWS IT. HE MIGHT BE SILENT NOW, BUT HE KNOWS IT. HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT QUIET FOR LONG, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, CHURCH, HE KNOWS IT. HE'S SEEING IT. HE KNOWS THE WAY THAT YOU TAKE. GOD KNOWS YOUR COMMITMENTS. He knows YOUR COMMITMENTS. HE KNOWS THE little that you are trying TO DO FOR HIM. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO FOR THE KINGDOM. GOD KNOWS. HE MIGHT HAVE NOT SAID THANK YOU. NOW, GOD KNOWS THE WAY THAT YOU HE KNOWS IT. He says he's a REWARDER of those who diligently seek. God will reward the reward because the way that I teach, you go forward. I can't find him on the backward. On the backward, I can't find him on the left side. I can't find him. On the right hand side, I CANNOT PERCEIVE HIM. I CAN'T BEHOLD MY LORD. NO PROBLEM. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, MY BROTHER. YOU MIGHT HAVE NOT SEEN HIM ON THE LEFT. YOU MIGHT HAVE not seen him on the right hand. You might have not seen him anywhere. You might have not PERCEIVED HIM. BUT I WANT TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU TODAY. HE KNOWS THE WAY THAT YOU TAKE. God knows it. God knows it. He knows your effort. He knows it. You are not here because you don't have what to do. No, &gt;&gt; you've got all you have A LOT TO DO. BUT BECAUSE YOU TOOK A STEP TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, HE CHOSE THE WAY THAT HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Blessed be the name of he says when he has tried me when the Lord has tried. Praise the Lord. When he has tried me, what will happen? Will you be thrown away? Will you be burnt? Will you be forsaken? Praise the Lord. What will he do? He says, I shall come forth as kings. your trial is for the purpose PROVING TO THE DEVIL THAT YOU ARE GOD. WELL, the devil doesn't KNOW WHO YOU ARE. HE'S ONLY GUESSING. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. HE'S TRYING TO ACCUSE YOU BEFORE GOD. You know what GOD WILL DO? WHEN THE DEVIL ACCUSES YOU BEFORE GOD BECAUSE OF YOUR WEAKNESS, you know what God does? TAKES YOU ASIDE AND PUT STRENGTH IN YOU AND HE BRINGS A TRIAL. THEN YOU COME OUT AS GOD AND PROVE TO THE DEVIL THAT YOU ARE NOT WHAT HE THINKS. YOU ARE IN HEAVEN MATERIAL CHILD OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT OUR God does. When he EVER ACCUSES YOU BEFORE, GOD DOES NOT ASHAME YOU BECAUSE YOU A SON. WHEN GOD ASHAMES YOU DEFEATING HIS PURPOSE. WHEN GOD ASHAMES YOU, HE'S ASHAMING HIMSELF. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF HIM. GOD CANNOT AFFORD TO EMBARRASS HIMSELF. AMEN. So the devil goes to him. You know what Edison has just done? THAT IS WHAT HE DOES. HE DID IT LAST WEEK. He did it today again. Then God will you know what God will do? God will put a conviction. It is dangerous to deny the call of God. WHEN YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART, GOD IS CALLING YOU. He wants to cheat for you. Exactly. So when you MAKE THAT MISTAKE, WHEN YOU GET into that weakness, the devil goes to accuse you. Ah, you know what God does? He waits for the devil to go and roam to and fro you with himself. Then tells the devil, you know what? Yesterday he told me this about TRY HIM. TRY HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD KNOWS that when you are tried, YOU WILL COME OUT AS GOD. THERE WAS A woman who had an issue of blood. She had a witness. But when she came to Christ, it ceased. He's waiting for you to come, with a sincere heart, not with pretense, not with hypocrisy. Don't pray because somebody is PRAYING NEXT TO YOU. PRAY BECAUSE GOD HAS PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS. HALLELUJAH. THE TIME HAS COME THAT WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL OVERNIGHTS. AMEN. That is you just shut in with God. Don't wait for Friday. Don't wait for the pastor. Don't wait for the church. A time has come for YOU TO FIND TIME WITH GOD. might plead your course that he might put strength in you so that when you come we will see that God has done a work when you pray shutting close the door speak to your God in you know what he does he who sees you in secret will reward you openly. God is not going to reward YOU IN SECRET. WHEN YOU PRAY in secret, God is going to reward you when your neighbors are singing. When your pastor is sing, when your friend in church is sing, when your wife is sing, when your daughter is sing, WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND you is sing, SURELY IS GOD who has done it. Praise God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He knows the way that I take. When he has this, the secret. I'm about to close. I don't preach for long. Praise the Lord. Jeremiah 14:7. This is this is the attitude that we should have when we are going to pray. He says, "Oh Lord," he's praying. He says, "Oh Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, I know that there's somebody here. Your iniquities testify against you even now as I speak. You know who you are. You know what you have done. As I'm speaking now, you know that I am the one. Well, there's still hope. Jeremiah said, "Though our iniquities, testify against us, do it for your name's sake. Praise the Lord. HE SAYS, "DO IT FOR your name's sake. FOR OUR BACKSLIDINGS ARE many as of truth. My iniquities testify against me. My backslidings are many. And it is not news to God. It's not going to be a shocker to him because they are new masses. Every day says your masses are new EVERY DAY. MY backslidings are many. Do it for your name's sake. You know what church? We carry the name of Christ. We have been named after him. &gt;&gt; Is that amen? We carry his name. &gt;&gt; You are carrying the name of Christ. So for the SAKE OF THAT NAME FOR THE SAKE OF THAT TESTIMONY, GOD IS going to overlook that AND HE WILL DO it for the sake of his name. What are you waiting for? Why are you sitting on your sin? Why you why are you magnifying your weakness? Why you looking at yourself as a failure? You are not the first person to commit. Praise the Lord. I am ENCOURAGING YOU TODAY. RUN TO CHRIST. RUN TO HIM. He's calling you. He's calling you. His mercies are new to us every morning. His mercies. He says somewhere that everyone that thirstes, come to the come to the waters. Come to the waters. Hallelujah. Brother, I tell you when a man is really getting hungering and thirsting for God, he will receive it. That's what brother said in the message Elijah preached 1953 October 18th paragraph 55. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES HE SAY? BROTHER, I TELL YOU WHEN A MAN IS REALLY GETTING HUNGERING AND THIRSTING FOR GOD, he will receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have not received it because You have not yet started hungry. When you GET HUNGRY FOR GOD, FASTING FOR GOD, you not wait to be told TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU NOT WAIT, YOU NOT WAIT TO BE TOLD TO PRAY AND FAST. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WAIT. YOU WILL DO IT. He says when a man has got hungering and fasting, hallelujah, for God, HE WILL RECEIVE IT. BROTHER, SISTER, start hungering. Start fasting and you'll receive it. You'll receive it. I don't have anything to tell you. I am telling you, you will receive your heart because God has promised it. God cannot fail. When you take his word of promise and you take it by faith and you believe it, that is THE ONLY TRUTH. GOD IS obligated to fulfill it. It is his obligation. IT IS his obligation. That is the responsibility. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The trouble of it IS THAT THE CHURCH IS not hungry enough tonight for God. Well, that's where the problem is. &gt;&gt; That's where the problem is. That's where you are failing. Hallelujah. That's where you have failed. You are not yet hungry for God. You are hungry for the world. You are thirsting for the things of the world. You are NOT THIRSTING FOR GOD. YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. You are hungry for God. That's why you are not receiving the Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord. And if you get thirsty for him and you get hungry for him, our prophet tells us you will receive it. The problem is you are not hungry enough. Praise the Lord. is the reason the Holy Spirit is not moving in the church. That's the reason the signs of the apostles well they say sometimes how does this healing and miracles and signs and wonders. He says it will work for you. It will work if you believe it. Amen. It will work if you believe it. Now I ask a question. What will happen if you don't believe it? It will not work. It is not working because you don't believe it. But when you believe it, it will work. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It will work if you believe it. If you will take God at his word, it will produce. Friends, the word of God is productive. It is productive. If you take the word of God by faith and you believe it, it will yield the same results yielded in the days of the apostles. It will happen. Praise the Lord. If only it is taken by faith. We are not seeing signs. We are not seeing wonders. Because we are not certain of God. &gt;&gt; WE ARE STILL DEBATING. WE ARE STILL DOUBTING. WE ARE STILL STANDING WITH TWO LEGS. ONE, ONE IN CHRIST. You have not decided. Decide and you will see God moving in your life. Make a decision. The way Job met, you seek for God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you believe it, it will work. He says, "God, let me live to prove that around the world that it is true." And so will it work today, tonight. It will work tonight, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year. IT WILL WORK HERE and take God at his word. It will happen. Not when you go back home. Praise the Lord. Not when you exit that door. It will happen here. Your desire, &gt;&gt; your blessing, your victory is within your disposal. It is at your reach. It is within you. You have not seen it because you have not sold for it. He says it will work tonight in drought or anything else. whether the sun is shining, whether there is darkness, whether there is light, whe praise the Lord. If you will meet God's condition, God will meet you on those grounds. What is the What is the condition of God? He's calling you to come. And when you come, but you've got to come to his condition. There are only three people who know. You, God, and Satan. The three of you know. Devil knows it. That's why he's accusing you before. And you also know that you have done it. Now God is calling you because he knows that you have done it and you also know that you have done it. Why run away? Why run away? He's calling you. He has seen your sin. HE HAS SEEN YOUR WEAKNESS. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU CANNOT DO. He knows that you desire to do it and yet you cannot do it. &gt;&gt; He knows it. God told Paul that you are my my strength is made perfect in a way. Look here. He said Paul &gt;&gt; my grace &gt;&gt; have you heard it? He said, "My grace is sufficient for you." PAUL HAD A WEAKNESS. He went to God and said, &gt;&gt; he said, "For this thing I BES three times, what is that thing that has pushed you to God?" Hallelujah. I thought I sold to God for his wickedness THAT HE MAY DEPART FROM ME. GOD SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? It's not about the weakness. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WEAKNESS. MY GRACE, MY GRACE, my grace is sufficient. The grace of God is sufficient for you is bigger than your weakness. Why run away? Why try to hide your weakness? Bring it to him. TELL GOD YOUR WEAKNESS. TELL HIM, "Hear the words that he will speak." AND THEN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S GOING TO ANSWER YOU. PAUL WENT TO HIM. He told him his weakness. Then he had the words. Oh, Paul, my my my my grace IS SUFFICIENT. WHEN HE HAD IT, &gt;&gt; it was revealed to him and then he understood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "When I want to do good, I find myself when I want to do good, I find myself doing bad. I don't know WHAT TO DO. WOE UNTO ME." THE SAME PAUL WHEN HE CONFESSED HIS WEAKNESS, he came out afterward. He said, "You know what? Longer I living." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOW CHRIST. YOU KNOW WHY IT WAS CHRIST now living? Because he went to him with his weakness. Go to him WITH YOUR WEAKNESS. TELL HIM WHO YOU ARE. Jesus is on the MAIN LINE. TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANT. TELL HIM WHO YOU ARE. IF YOU WANT THE HOLY GHOST, SPEAK TO HIM. TELL HIM I'M WEAK. BUT I KNOW WHEN I GET YOUR LIFE IN ME, THEN I WILL BE STRONG. HE WILL GIVE YOU. God will grant you. the desire of your heart. Stop running away. Run back to him. RUN BACK TO HIM. DON'T RUN AWAY from him because you'll run to your you will perish. You run to your death. DON'T RUN AWAY FROM HIM. RUN TO HIM. HE WILL PUT STRENGTH IN YOU. Then you will live. Amen. May the Lord bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Blessed father of Jesus, we thank you for your grace for Lord. Though we may seek you and you seem not to be found of us, BUT YOU HAVE ASSURED US THAT YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT WE TAKE WHEN YOU have tried us, we will come forth as God. Thank you for that blessed Lord. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercies that are new to us EVERY MORNING. LORD, WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING AWAY from you. Now we are running back. We are running back to you. We are running back to you. You made a reconciliation. YOU MADE A RECONCILIATION. YOU RESTORED THE RELATIONSHIP. OH MY LORD, we have come back. We know that you'll not receive. We know you not receive us. There was that prodigal son. He wasted AWAY HIS BLESSINGS. OH, BUT WHEN HE CAME BACK, HIS FATHER RECEIVED IT. AND YOU PUT A RING ON HIS FEET, LORD. WE ARE ALSO THE SAME. LORD, WE ARE COMING BACK. WE MIGHT HAVE WASTED OUR WAY, but we ARE COMING BACK NOW. WE KNOW YOU ARE WAITING FOR US. WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CAST US AWAY. You are waiting with a robe to put on us. You are waiting with a ring of gold on our finger. You are not TAKING US AS SERVANTS. OH, &gt;&gt; you are taking us back to our position. You are putting us as our in our position as sons AND DAUGHTERS. YOU ARE WAITING FOR us to come THAT YOU MAY RESTORE US TO our position. Blessed be your name of God. We thank you for that grace. Thank you for that word. Thank you for your encouragement. Lord, you are still with us. Lord, we have come. Forgive us Lord where we have errored. There's anything which we know that is there THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT HAS BROUGHT SHAME AND REPRESSION. Oh Lord, there is that cross that is still dripping with blood. Wash us with your help Lord that father will be like you. Make us more like you. Your image us Lord. Draw us to yourself that we'll be perfected. Even as you Lord, we can do all things through you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you abundantly. Let us stand our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us give the Lord another clap of praise. Amen. Let us sing. He abides. Amen. Now, I believe that that was the Lord speaking to us tonight in the in the Ephesian church age. He says the bride, she's a a beaten work, handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given. What he is, she is to reflect. What he has, she is to manifest. There is no fault in her. Amen. She is all glorious within and without, from beginning to ending. from beginning to ending. You know what amazes me is that when he saw you, when he saw me, he did not see me at the beginning only. He saw me at the beginning, but he saw me at the end. And what did he see? She is the work of her Lord. And all his works are perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God. You see that is why brother sister when you go through some thing in your life maybe a law a law and uh you feel that you know there's a song which says I've sinned and there is no use to pray and then he says I look AWAY TO JESUS WHO tells me to say I see a crimson stream of blood which flows from Calvary You know, a pretender, someone who is not truly a son or daughter of God, when something wrong goes on in your life, you just blush it away and you live on. But if you are a true child of God and something wrong happens in your life, you cannot cover it up. You You're going to hunger. You are going to thirst for something better. Like that prodical son, he hungered and thirsted for his father. He said, "Let me go to my father. LET ME PUT THIS THING right even if he doesn't accept me as A SON. AT LEAST HE WILL ACCEPT ME as a son. But it is better. Amen. To be in my father's house AS A SERVANT AND TO PERISH OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. Our thirst and hunger should be after God. And as a son of God, daughter of God, you remember this that you may look around in your life and you don't see God. But then you remember, God sees you. God knows you. That's what should always encourage us. Amen. He knows the way that you take. Let us sing. He knows. We'll sing abides afterwards. I have a maker. Sing it with me now with all your heart. He formed my heart before even time began. My life was in his hand. Well, he knows. He knows my name. He knows. &gt;&gt; He knows my &gt;&gt; Oh my every thought. He sees. each that falls and hears me when I go. I have a father. Say it with me now. I have a father. He calls me his own. &gt;&gt; He calls me &gt;&gt; his own. He'll never leave me. He'll never leave me. Think about that. No matter where I go. Oh, he knows. He knows. He knows my name. in all my every soul is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That falls and be I have a father. Close your eyes and sing it with me now. I have a father. I have a father. Say he called me his own. He called me &gt;&gt; Jesus. He'll never leave me. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No matter. No matter. away. I know. Oh, he knows. He knows my my He knows. He knows my &gt;&gt; my thought. is all deep that falls and hears me when I go with every eye closed. Saints before we leave and maybe you want to say Lord that was mine. That is me that you spoke to. What God has placed in the heart of a child is to cry when she needs milk. She doesn't even know what she needs maybe. But that that thirst in the child makes her to cry out. If there is a deep calling, there is a deep response. If you're a daughter son of God, when you are living in a life that is not right, somehow there will be something in you calling for something better. There is a thirst. There is a hunger that God places in you. The fact that you have that hunger and thirst declares that you are a child of God. And it declares that there is something better somewhere for you. That's why if you don't have a hunger and a thirst, there is something wrong. There is something wrong. But if you're a child of God, you cannot settle for less. You want something better. You want to live a better life. You want to walk right with God. You want to walk live a dedicated life. Where are you friends? As we are beginning this year, this being the first month of the year, how are you going to live your life? Because without this hunger, without this thirst to be even in his presence, filled with his spirit, you cannot overcome. For we need his spirit. When he fills us, then he sends us to the testing. Then he sends us to the to all the trials and things and but somehow there is something within us that hold and that's what we need. You can't get it without hungering after him. Maybe you want to slip out your hand and say, "Lord, I'm that sermon today was mine. Lord, I'm crying out for something in my life that you may come and fill me. Let us pray together. Loving Jesus. Perhaps there are people here with their hands up. You know each one. For there is one thing that I know. If you allow a servant of God to come behind this pullpit and permit them to speak things like we had tonight, it's only because you're discerning someone's heart. a child of God. You are reaching out to someone that has perhaps gone astray and you're pulling them back again, reminding them because they have this hunger and thirst. There is something better for them. Lord, I pray that you will come and meet each one. Lord, let your presence fill our hearts. May we be on fire for God. Lord. May you come and forgive sin. Come and wash us. Let your Holy Spirit come in our hearts, oh God, in each one, Father that is hungering for you that is desiring you, Lord. Come and take over, Lord Jesus. For we are your children, oh God. And we know that you know our name. You know every tear that falls. When no one understands, Lord, you understand because you're the God that understands and you are touched by the feelings of our infirmities and you understand whatsoever thing that my brother sister is going through Lord and you are coming down right at their address. Take over Father to move in their lives to prove to them I am the Lord and I fail not for I put strength in you. Thank you Lord Jesus. I need more of that strength. My brother here needs it. My sister here needs it. Grant it, Lord, that you come and abide. It's my prayer, my cry. Grant it, Lord. I have a father. He calls me his own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go, sing it. He knows. He knows my name. &gt;&gt; He knows. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. My every thought is se that f and hears me when I call. Amen. Let us pray for the offerings. Father Lord, as we are going to dismiss tonight, we ask your blessings, Lord, upon the people that have come here, Lord, as just to sacrifice and offer their time. Bless each one that has come tonight. And Lord, I pray that you'll also give the blessing to the substance that they're going to give out of their hands. Bless each giver according to your promises. You promise to bless us and open doors for them. Whoever will take something Lord by faith and give it to you towards your work. Lord, may you also give back to them. And I pray, oh God, you multiply whatever will be given for your king. We just love you, Lord. We give ourselves to you. We pray that you'll also bless the speaker tonight. Brother Edson, bless him, Lord. Bless his family. Lord, may you restore the strength that he has used. And father, Lord, bless him abundantly. And whenever he stands, Lord, in this place or any other place that he will be a blessing to your bride. Grant it Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Let us sing that song. He abides.
