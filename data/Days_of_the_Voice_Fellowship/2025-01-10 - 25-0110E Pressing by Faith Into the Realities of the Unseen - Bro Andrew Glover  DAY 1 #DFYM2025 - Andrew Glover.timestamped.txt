[1:29:37] year uh we had our
[1:29:39] second uh dvf Youth
[1:29:45] Camp um having finished the first
[1:29:50] one
[1:29:52] I you know have been following the
[1:29:55] ministry of brother Glover for a while
[1:30:00] online and um and um you know loved it
[1:30:04] because it's a very Dynamic
[1:30:07] Ministry how many here have had him
[1:30:10] preached
[1:30:11] before okay so um the young people in
[1:30:17] Africa brother glovera have not heard
[1:30:19] you
[1:30:21] preach and and that means is very
[1:30:26] high and so um I got in touch with
[1:30:31] him and I put it to him I asked him have
[1:30:34] you been in Africa
[1:30:37] before he said uh yes he told me a place
[1:30:41] somewhere I told him you need to come to
[1:30:43] the real Africa if you've not been to
[1:30:49] Uganda you've not been in in in the real
[1:30:52] Africa
[1:30:54] East Africa is the real
[1:30:57] Africa as much as I know Pastor Manda
[1:31:00] May disagree
[1:31:04] somehow and so he accepted my
[1:31:08] invitation and um he was supposed to be
[1:31:12] one of the speakers of the second
[1:31:15] come last year in
[1:31:18] January but when you know I love obeying
[1:31:21] the Holy Spirit
[1:31:24] and um so when I I happened to be in
[1:31:28] Germany and there was meetings
[1:31:32] there and we met with Brother Tim and
[1:31:35] brother Timothy and other
[1:31:38] brothers and as uh brother Timothy BR
[1:31:45] ministered uh you know something you
[1:31:47] know was made real in my
[1:31:51] heart like I should say the speak spoke
[1:31:54] to
[1:31:56] me that he along with Brother David
[1:31:59] would be the speakers for the
[1:32:06] 2024 and so I I did not hesitate I just
[1:32:10] told I talked with
[1:32:12] brother brother
[1:32:15] Glover and I told him brother Glover I'm
[1:32:20] sorry but I would like I would like you
[1:32:23] to allow me
[1:32:25] have brother Timothy and Brother
[1:32:29] David and brother Glover graciously
[1:32:34] accepted but we went out of touch for a
[1:32:39] while and so I did
[1:32:41] not cuz I told him we will have you
[1:32:44] speak on our next
[1:32:49] come and so but you know things happen
[1:32:52] so fast
[1:32:54] and as you saw we announced speakers and
[1:32:57] he was um you know I invited Brother
[1:33:00] Joseph
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:04] chosi and by the
[1:33:06] Wayne um we have a few clips from them
[1:33:10] you will listen to them tomorrow
[1:33:14] morning I'm not too sure whether my
[1:33:16] media team is ready with them
[1:33:18] now so we will have you listen to them
[1:33:20] in the morning
[1:33:21] tomorrow so um
[1:33:25] then I was surprised but the Wayne told
[1:33:28] me I'm coming with a
[1:33:31] brother when I come to visit in
[1:33:34] Africa so it was much later that he told
[1:33:37] me this brother would be brother Andrew
[1:33:42] Glover and I I talked to my wife I said
[1:33:46] I do not know what God is trying to
[1:33:50] do you see I did not talk about brother
[1:33:54] Glover I even told by Wayne that I had
[1:33:56] invited by
[1:34:01] Glover so I want to
[1:34:04] say this was not my
[1:34:07] invitation it was not by the Wayne's
[1:34:12] invitation like a precious Pastor Sean
[1:34:14] preached in the morning in the afternoon
[1:34:17] it is God his
[1:34:19] invitation and
[1:34:22] um um I I will speak about brother
[1:34:25] Dwayne
[1:34:28] later but when he could not be able to
[1:34:32] come many things
[1:34:34] happened and brother Glover also was not
[1:34:37] able to
[1:34:40] come um maybe he will feel to talk about
[1:34:42] it I don't know he had a few health
[1:34:46] issues and he was not able to
[1:34:49] come so he told me I am not able to come
[1:34:55] but I want to say he was not able to
[1:34:58] come I did not invite
[1:35:01] him but God made him able to
[1:35:05] come because God wanted him here
[1:35:11] today and so why did I say these few
[1:35:14] words is to make you understand this is
[1:35:18] beyond
[1:35:19] me it is beyond us as human beings
[1:35:24] when God has a plan he will accomplish
[1:35:27] it no matter
[1:35:29] what and so you that has come here in
[1:35:33] this
[1:35:34] meetings under
[1:35:36] expectation I want you to believe that
[1:35:38] God has a table
[1:35:42] spray and I've listened to a few sermons
[1:35:44] you preached brother
[1:35:46] GL an imense

[1:35:52] by brother Eddie biscow

[1:35:56] ministry and I used to watch a lot of
[1:35:59] their youth
[1:36:02] camps and that's where I saw you preach
[1:36:04] for the first

[1:43:22] messag amen
[1:43:26] the Bible says the law and the prophets
[1:43:28] were un John and since that time the
[1:43:32] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[1:43:35] presseth into
[1:43:45] it I love what Jesus says
[1:43:49] here there is a preaching of the Kingdom
[1:43:54] but there's also a pressing into to
[1:43:56] what's being
[1:43:58] preached now in Philippians chapter
[1:44:02] 3 Philippians chapter 3 and verse
[1:44:06] 13 amen I want to uh just share a few
[1:44:10] things with you tonight that's on our
[1:44:11] heart and been studying and burning on
[1:44:13] our heart lately Philippians 3 and13
[1:44:17] phili Paul here writing he says Brethren
[1:44:19] I count not myself to have apprehended
[1:44:22] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:44:25] things which are behind and reaching
[1:44:28] forth unto those things which are
[1:44:31] before you said verse verse number 13
[1:44:35] verse 13
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:47] okay I love what Paul says
[1:44:50] here there are some things behind
[1:44:54] us but they're not worthy to go back
[1:44:58] to as a matter of fact they are to be
[1:45:02] forgotten and reach forth into the
[1:45:05] things that are in front of
[1:45:06] you now watch what Paul says I press
[1:45:10] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:45:12] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:45:23] in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:45:27] 4 and verse number
[1:45:30] 13 I believe there we will find how a
[1:45:33] Believer
[1:45:36] presses Paul Paul again here in 2
[1:45:39] Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number
[1:45:44] 13 we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:45:47] according as it is written I believed
[1:45:50] and therefore have I spoken we also
[1:45:53] believe and therefore
[1:46:05] speak so a Believer presses by believing
[1:46:09] what has been spoken in The Same Spirit
[1:46:12] of faith that it was spoken
[1:46:20] in in verse number 18 Paul says says
[1:46:24] this while we look not at the things
[1:46:26] which are seen But at the things which
[1:46:29] are not seen for the things which are
[1:46:32] seen are temporal but the things which
[1:46:35] are not seen are
[1:46:47] Eternal we ask Lord to add the blessing
[1:46:50] to the reading of his word as you may be
[1:46:51] seated
[1:46:54] I want to speak to you tonight on this
[1:46:57] thought pressing by faith into the
[1:47:00] realities of the
[1:47:04] Unseen pressing by faith into the
[1:47:06] realities of the
[1:47:09] Unseen in
[1:47:12] 1960 in 1960 brother B preaches a very
[1:47:15] powerful
[1:47:17] sermon he calls it the unfailing
[1:47:20] realities of the Living God
[1:47:26] in that sermon he is speaking of people
[1:47:28] receiving the Holy
[1:47:31] Ghost he says oh how many has received
[1:47:34] the Holy Ghost Among
[1:47:37] Us he said now may it revive us to a
[1:47:40] spot that we'll go to searching and
[1:47:47] hungering and pulling for the realities
[1:47:50] of God
[1:47:52] he said God is a
[1:47:55] reality now how many believes tonight
[1:47:58] that God is a
[1:48:00] reality amen he's not just a figment of
[1:48:03] our
[1:48:06] imagination but God is a
[1:48:09] reality now we know that God is not
[1:48:12] three
[1:48:13] persons but there is one
[1:48:16] Lord manifested in three different
[1:48:19] offices brother B will say now the Holy
[1:48:22] Spirit Will not misbehave itself in one
[1:48:27] person and behave itself in
[1:48:30] another it'll make each person come into
[1:48:34] its character
[1:48:36] see because it's a spirit that lead
[1:48:40] you it brings and makes you subject to
[1:48:43] its
[1:48:45] nature you don't bring it subject to
[1:48:47] your
[1:48:49] nature it makes you subject to its
[1:48:51] nature
[1:48:53] he said now the holy spirit makes you
[1:48:55] live and love to do
[1:48:57] it how you love to give up the things of
[1:49:00] the world when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:05] in all how it cleanses you and washes
[1:49:09] you and puts a desire in you to follow
[1:49:13] him and a thirst and a Hunger for More
[1:49:16] of
[1:49:17] it see you are just bathing
[1:49:21] yourself he br brings
[1:49:24] realities another place brother said
[1:49:26] what we need
[1:49:28] today is men and women who wants a
[1:49:32] reality me not a Creed but a
[1:49:36] reality he said that's what the world
[1:49:38] needs today is not Creeds and
[1:49:41] Fashions we need realities in God see
[1:49:46] the world don't want it the world does
[1:49:49] not want it the church will not accept
[1:49:52] it
[1:49:54] but he is the god of
[1:49:57] realities now when you think about this
[1:50:00] pressing the word press means to move or
[1:50:03] to cause to move into a position of
[1:50:06] contact with someone or
[1:50:11] something by exerting a continuous
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:16] Force when we speak of this word
[1:50:19] reality it is the thing that exist in
[1:50:22] fact
[1:50:24] having previously only existed in one's
[1:50:28] mind it is a a
[1:50:31] reality is something that was in one's
[1:50:35] mind at one time but is now a
[1:50:39] fact see now we know that the most
[1:50:42] powerful force on Earth is God
[1:50:47] right brother said there's no more
[1:50:50] powerful force than God
[1:50:53] and he says one of the doctors told me
[1:50:55] the other day that the greatest power in
[1:50:58] the
[1:50:59] world is not the atomic
[1:51:02] bomb but it is a Believer who is in
[1:51:05] contact with his
[1:51:06] maker see a Believer gets in contact
[1:51:10] with his maker it will change his
[1:51:12] attitude it changes his mental it
[1:51:15] changes his habit it changes his body it
[1:51:19] changes his nature it changes everything
[1:51:23] now when a Believer comes in contact
[1:51:25] with god he has the ability to change
[1:51:29] that
[1:51:31] individual let me say science does not
[1:51:34] have the ability Amen to change an
[1:51:37] individual into what God desires from
[1:51:40] you as a
[1:51:42] Believer brother random in 1949 in in
[1:51:45] 1949 brother speaking on the subject of
[1:51:50] Science and he begins to told that there
[1:51:53] is a natural man and there is a
[1:51:56] spiritual man he says now the natural
[1:51:59] man has went into the research from the
[1:52:01] fall of the natural and what he has
[1:52:06] done me the natural
[1:52:09] man has gone into from the
[1:52:12] fall has gone into
[1:52:15] research of what he has
[1:52:19] done and what he has done
[1:52:24] and how little the spiritual man has
[1:52:26] progressed in the kingdom of
[1:52:31] God the natural man is progressing in
[1:52:34] the Earth by
[1:52:37] science the spiritual man is to progress
[1:52:40] in the kingdom of
[1:52:43] God he said now the natural man has gone
[1:52:46] out by
[1:52:47] science he has he has split open an adom
[1:52:52] he has split open in
[1:52:55] Adam
[1:52:59] uhuh he has broken Adam in
[1:53:02] two and by breaking that in
[1:53:05] two he has actually moved into more sin
[1:53:08] and
[1:53:11] ungodliness he has moved into more sin
[1:53:13] and ungodliness
[1:53:23] amen is everybody okay okay he said my
[1:53:27] friends let's Let the church move up
[1:53:31] forward let's Let the church move up
[1:53:38] forward amen you love the
[1:53:43] Lord amen he said see let's press into
[1:53:47] the
[1:53:49] Unseen see the blessings are yours
[1:53:53] and they are there for you but you've
[1:53:55] got to press into where those blessings
[1:53:59] are now brother Brandon will tell us
[1:54:01] that
[1:54:03] science has actually has actually
[1:54:06] blundered until they have moved into
[1:54:11] realities now brother Brandon will
[1:54:13] preach a sermon called looking to the
[1:54:17] Unseen he said now we look at the Unseen
[1:54:21] we look at the
[1:54:23] Unseen and believe that those things
[1:54:26] which are
[1:54:28] unseen but spoke of by God become
[1:54:33] realities we believe the things that are
[1:54:37] unseen but they're spoke of by
[1:54:40] God they become
[1:54:43] realities see when a man becomes United
[1:54:46] with
[1:54:47] God he begins to believe his
[1:54:50] word and Things become
[1:54:54] realities see you can see
[1:54:57] them and you can know that they are
[1:55:00] true so whatever God
[1:55:03] speaks must become a
[1:55:06] reality but he's got to have
[1:55:09] somebody who will believe what he has
[1:55:12] said will become a
[1:55:15] reality see it's more than just looking
[1:55:18] at
[1:55:19] something see we are not here as just ch
[1:55:22] church
[1:55:23] members we are here as
[1:55:26] Believers now brother brandom said all
[1:55:28] things are
[1:55:30] possible he said to God he said but all
[1:55:34] things are possible to
[1:55:36] you then when you begin to believe
[1:55:40] God The Impossibles is made
[1:55:44] realities when God is taken at his
[1:55:48] word when a Believer begins to believe
[1:55:51] God
[1:55:53] the word becomes a
[1:55:55] reality see it's more than just a man's
[1:55:58] word it's the infallibility of God's
[1:56:01] spoken
[1:56:03] word brother bam said if that could
[1:56:06] settle in our minds of who said it it is
[1:56:11] the spoken word he said the thought was
[1:56:14] expressed in a
[1:56:16] word now once God expresses his
[1:56:20] thought and makes it a word
[1:56:23] he can never take it
[1:56:25] back if God said you're the
[1:56:28] bride he can never take it back if he
[1:56:32] said you're going in the Rapture he can
[1:56:35] never take it back if he said you're a
[1:56:38] part of a New
[1:56:39] Jerusalem he can never take it back it
[1:56:43] must become a
[1:56:46] reality you are the reality of God's
[1:56:50] spoken
[1:56:51] word somebody spoke it and you believed
[1:56:55] it and now you are the reality of what
[1:56:59] God has Tau of you in the age that
[1:57:02] you're living in you see we are a
[1:57:04] two-fold
[1:57:06] being we have an outward man and we have
[1:57:09] an inward man do you know the outward
[1:57:13] man he looks by his eyes but the inward
[1:57:17] man he walks by
[1:57:20] faith now the outward man
[1:57:23] is but the inward man is
[1:57:26] god brother said we look with our
[1:57:29] eyes but we see with our heart we look
[1:57:33] with our eyes but we see with our
[1:57:37] heart we look at the things which are
[1:57:41] unseen by our heart the things which are
[1:57:44] seen are
[1:57:46] temporary the things which are not seen
[1:57:49] are
[1:57:50] Eternal do you realize this message said
[1:57:54] God would send us Elijah the prophet now
[1:57:58] watch He's not going to turn our eyes
[1:58:02] he's going to turn our heart because a
[1:58:06] Believer does not look with our eyes
[1:58:09] they look with our heart don't you see
[1:58:12] what this message has done it has turned
[1:58:15] our heart we are not looking at the word
[1:58:18] through our eyes we are looking at it
[1:58:21] from our
[1:58:22] heart and from our heart we believe God
[1:58:25] is the savior and from our heart we
[1:58:28] believe he's a Healer and from our heart
[1:58:30] we believe are going in the Rapture and
[1:58:33] these things are becoming
[1:58:35] realities my goodness Amen to think
[1:58:39] tonight to think tonight that the time
[1:58:42] has
[1:58:43] come for the Believers to go
[1:58:46] forward brother said we got to work
[1:58:48] together as one unit we got to get our
[1:58:51] difference away we got to lay aside our
[1:58:54] doctrines and we got to press forward we
[1:58:58] got to press forward listen and we've
[1:59:01] got to take the promises that God has
[1:59:04] given
[1:59:06] us the devil's not going to get out of
[1:59:08] our way and allow us to take our
[1:59:12] promises but there are some Believers
[1:59:15] here who are not
[1:59:17] sissies we are not cowards we are
[1:59:21] warriors we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:59:23] God we have been born from the genes of
[1:59:26] God we believe God
[1:59:30] therefore this is time for
[1:59:33] war it's time for
[1:59:36] war listen I think I think we have
[1:59:39] stayed out of our land long
[1:59:41] enough I think we have stayed away from
[1:59:44] the promises long enough we are under a
[1:59:47] Divine
[1:59:48] commission to possess Divine promises
[1:59:53] brother said a man that is commissioned
[1:59:55] of God he only looks
[1:59:58] upward and
[2:00:00] onward listen there are some things
[2:00:03] behind us but the Holy Ghost is in front
[2:00:06] of
[2:00:07] us I think it's time to be more than
[2:00:10] just church
[2:00:11] members I think it's time to be
[2:00:14] perseverant
[2:00:16] Believers you know what perseverance
[2:00:18] means it means to be persistent
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:23] to make a
[2:00:24] goal brother said we should press
[2:00:28] towards the mark of the high calling in
[2:00:32] Christ Jesus let me say we're not just
[2:00:35] pressing we are pressing towards
[2:00:39] something brother bam said to the
[2:00:41] complete
[2:00:43] identification come on church amen we're

[2:01:04] Messengers who ate the tree
[2:01:06] down there were four death
[2:01:10] Messengers who eat the tree
[2:01:16] down they destroyed the
[2:01:19] tree but there would be for Life me
[2:01:22] Messengers that would restore the tree
[2:01:25] back your complete
[2:01:28] identification is not in
[2:01:31] justification it's not in
[2:01:33] sanctification it's not even in the
[2:01:35] baptism of the Holy
[2:01:37] Ghost
[2:01:39] justification made way for
[2:01:41] sanctification made way for the baptism
[2:01:43] of the Holy Ghost which made way for the
[2:01:46] word
[2:01:47] itself to come down into the Perfection
[2:01:50] of the church
[2:01:52] we are not just Justified Christians we
[2:01:56] are not just Sanctified Christians we
[2:01:58] are not just Holy Ghost F Christians we
[2:02:01] are the reality of the spoken word
[2:02:05] bride our complete
[2:02:08] identification is in the word if it's in
[2:02:11] the word we can have
[2:02:14] it if it's in the word it belongs to us
[2:02:19] then
[2:02:20] tonight we are PR
[2:02:23] into the
[2:02:24] Fulfillment of scriptural
[2:02:26] promises now I'll say this it's time to
[2:02:30] go
[2:02:31] forward it's time to move
[2:02:34] forward it's time to
[2:02:36] advance and the only way you can
[2:02:40] advance in this hour that we're living
[2:02:43] in is by
[2:02:45] pressing you say why do you say
[2:02:48] that because the lid has come off of
[2:02:51] hell
[2:02:53] the lid has come off of
[2:02:57] Hil there are 200,000,000
[2:03:02] demons that have been loosed out of the
[2:03:04] river of Euphrates against this
[2:03:09] bride I feel like preaching on that
[2:03:12] point amen can I say something to you
[2:03:15] can I say something we can number the
[2:03:18] demons against us brother you have left
[2:03:21] me we can number the demons against
[2:03:25] us 200,000,000
[2:03:29] demons but we cannot
[2:03:32] number the Angels that's with
[2:03:35] us the Apostle Paul

[2:08:03] Devil he is

[2:09:08] service we don't have to wait one more
[2:09:11] second we don't have to wait one more
[2:09:14] second we can break through right now we
[2:09:18] can break out of the spere we can break
[2:09:21] out of the unbelief we can break out of
[2:09:23] the fear all things are possible to them
[2:09:27] that
[2:09:30] believe Hallelujah am so a prophet stood
[2:09:34] there and he preached the word and he
[2:09:37] said
[2:09:38] Lord come get in your
[2:09:41] word and as I speak your
[2:09:44] word give them faith for the glory of
[2:09:48] God
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:09:51] so a
[2:09:52] prophet was preaching the
[2:09:55] word and God was giving him the word to
[2:09:59] say to defeat the defeated
[2:10:04] enemy
[2:10:05] Amen in other words he didn't just tell
[2:10:09] him who the enemy
[2:10:11] was he gave him a weapon to kill the
[2:10:16] enemy oh Church of the Living God can I
[2:10:20] tell you what that weapon is
[2:10:22] it's the weapon of
[2:10:23] Faith come on it's the weapon of
[2:10:26] Faith you heard it this morning it's not
[2:10:30] the weapon of
[2:10:32] feelings it's the weapon of
[2:10:35] Faith see what Paul said his faith is
[2:10:39] the substance of things
[2:10:42] hopeful it's the evidence of Things Not
[2:10:45] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[2:10:49] good report
[2:10:51] and through faith we understand that the
[2:10:55] worlds were
[2:10:57] framed by the word of God so that the
[2:11:01] things which are
[2:11:02] seen were not made of things which do
[2:11:06] appear can I tell you what a prophet
[2:11:08] said he said you
[2:11:10] testify of the things you do not
[2:11:16] see oh my amen you don't testify of what
[2:11:20] you see
[2:11:21] you testify of what you don't see you
[2:11:24] have five inner
[2:11:27] senses and you have five outer
[2:11:30] senses see taste feel smell
[2:11:34] here reason memory imagination affection
[2:11:37] and
[2:11:39] conscience you have five outer five
[2:11:42] inner none of them will declare
[2:11:46] God but there is a super
[2:11:49] sense which is called the
[2:11:52] which a prophet called faith and he said
[2:11:55] faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:11:58] for it's the evidence of Things Not
[2:12:03] Seen we can see the doctor's
[2:12:06] report but we don't talk about it we can
[2:12:10] see the wayward child going further in
[2:12:13] sin come on you say brother Andrew I've
[2:12:16] got a loved one and they're going away
[2:12:19] from God and they're own they're own
[2:12:21] drugs they're drinking alcohol they're
[2:12:24] living immoral oh they're getting
[2:12:28] tattoos you can see all those
[2:12:31] things but what you can't
[2:12:33] see is more real than what you
[2:12:37] can so you
[2:12:40] testify of what you don't see when
[2:12:43] you're looking at what you do
[2:12:45] see in other
[2:12:47] words can I ask you something when did
[2:12:51] the prodical son start
[2:12:54] testifying his son was coming
[2:12:58] home did he start testifying the day
[2:13:00] that he started on his way
[2:13:03] home but the minute he left the father's
[2:13:06] house the father begin to
[2:13:09] testify he's coming back home they could
[2:13:13] see the
[2:13:14] pigs he could see the life he was
[2:13:17] living but beyond that he could see a
[2:13:20] promise
[2:13:21] that would become a reality and for day
[2:13:25] after day after day he fought against
[2:13:28] that devil he said your boy is never
[2:13:31] coming
[2:13:32] home and one day Hallelujah one day he
[2:13:37] looked across the hill and here come his
[2:13:41] son what he had believed he had spoken
[2:13:46] and it become a
[2:13:47] reality oh Church of the Living God I
[2:13:51] say tonight this is a spoken word
[2:13:54] generation speak the word and believe
[2:13:58] what you say and watch it become a
[2:14:01] reality faith is
[2:14:04] something it's born in you faith is
[2:14:11] Supernatural faith is
[2:14:13] something that you have to believe it's
[2:14:16] there that really nothing else will
[2:14:18] declare it's there
[2:14:23] brother Bram said what is
[2:14:26] Faith it's an unseen
[2:14:33] Force see it's the holy spirit that
[2:14:37] brings
[2:14:38] Faith so faith is the evidence of Things
[2:14:43] Not
[2:14:44] Seen the Bible says that Noah being
[2:14:48] warned of God
[2:14:51] of things not
[2:14:53] seen as
[2:14:55] yet I love
[2:14:59] that as yet he moved with
[2:15:03] fear and he prepared an
[2:15:06] ark you know the prophet of God said
[2:15:09] before he saw one drop of
[2:15:12] rain before he saw one cloud in the
[2:15:15] sky he moved with
[2:15:18] faith in the Amplified Bible
[2:15:22] that that
[2:15:23] phrase Things Not
[2:15:25] Seen
[2:15:27] translates to events not yet
[2:15:32] seen oh my don't we have a sermon called
[2:15:36] events made clear by
[2:15:43] prophecy in other words as Believers we
[2:15:48] do not wait for the event to believe the
[2:15:50] prophecy
[2:15:54] we believe the
[2:15:56] prophecy therefore we know the event
[2:15:58] will take
[2:16:00] place now come on church we do not wait
[2:16:04] for the
[2:16:05] event we believe the
[2:16:08] prophecy because we know where it's
[2:16:10] coming
[2:16:11] from it's coming from God and what he
[2:16:15] says will never fail what he says he
[2:16:20] will not take
[2:16:21] back if God is God then he is a Healer
[2:16:26] if God is God he's a savior if God is
[2:16:30] God he's the one who sent this
[2:16:33] message if God is God he's the god of
[2:16:36] these meetings he's the God of this
[2:16:39] Youth Camp he's the god of every
[2:16:41] preacher on this
[2:16:43] platform if God is God I believe what he
[2:16:47] said the Holy Ghost has lit a in my
[2:16:52] soul and the prophet of God said the
[2:16:56] Holy Ghost will fan the
[2:16:58] Flames until it becomes a
[2:17:02] [Applause]
[2:17:06] reality I say Satan you don't have
[2:17:10] enough water to put out this fire you
[2:17:14] don't have enough wind to stop this fire
[2:17:18] it's like fire and it's shut up in my
[2:17:21] bones it's the quickening power it's the
[2:17:24] Dynamics of the Holy
[2:17:26] Ghost and it keeps
[2:17:28] burning it keeps burning till it becomes
[2:17:31] a
[2:17:32] reality I'm going to say it I'm going to
[2:17:35] say it if a prophet said it you can
[2:17:39] believe
[2:17:41] it if a prophet said your birth is not
[2:17:44] your
[2:17:45] adoption if a prophet said your birth is
[2:17:48] not your adoption
[2:17:51] believe a prophet over what a man
[2:17:54] say if a prophet said that there is
[2:17:58] going to be an invencible
[2:18:00] army it's going to come to
[2:18:02] pass come on Church you know what he
[2:18:05] said he said a man can live so close to
[2:18:09] God till the devil don't know what to do
[2:18:11] with
[2:18:13] it I'm
[2:18:14] looking I'm looking at the reality of
[2:18:19] what a prophet spoke
[2:18:20] [Applause]
[2:18:27] Hallelujah you are the
[2:18:30] reality you are the
[2:18:33] reality you say I'm the
[2:18:36] reality well we are under the order of
[2:18:39] MDC amen we're under the order of
[2:18:46] MDC can I say what the prophet
[2:18:49] said he said we see he promised it in
[2:18:52] the
[2:18:54] Bible we believe it are y'all ready for
[2:18:58] this soul body and
[2:19:03] spirit how is that
[2:19:05] possible because the Holy Ghost is a
[2:19:10] reality that comes into you and you
[2:19:13] don't bring it subject to your
[2:19:19] nature the holy ghost brings you subject
[2:19:22] to
[2:19:24] his and the Holy Ghost believes the
[2:19:28] word I feel good I feel like preaching
[2:19:33] the Holy Ghost believes this
[2:19:35] message the Holy Ghost believes what a
[2:19:38] prophet said the Holy Ghost backs up
[2:19:41] what brother brandom
[2:19:44] said can I tell you something can I tell
[2:19:47] you something this world you're living
[2:19:50] in
[2:19:52] is the only place that does not believe
[2:19:55] what a prophet

[2:23:07] believers do you know there's three
[2:23:09] kinds of Believers brother R said in
[2:23:12] every
[2:23:13] Church there's a
[2:23:15] Believer unbeliever and a real and a m
[2:23:19] believer I bring something to you
[2:23:22] there's three kinds of
[2:23:24] Believers in every
[2:23:28] [Applause]
[2:23:32] believer you have a body you have a
[2:23:35] spirit and you have a soul don't me
[2:23:38] prove it to you your body is flesh and
[2:23:43] your flesh is a
[2:23:44] byproduct of an affair of your
[2:23:46] adulterous
[2:23:48] paren your flesh is an
[2:23:51] unbeliever it's your flesh that don't
[2:23:54] want to go to
[2:23:56] church it's your flesh that don't want
[2:23:58] to
[2:23:59] sing it's your flesh that don't want to
[2:24:02] pray it's your flesh that don't want to
[2:24:05] worship because it's an
[2:24:08] unbeliever but you move a little bit
[2:24:10] deeper and you got a spirit your spirit
[2:24:14] is a make
[2:24:16] believer if everything's going good your
[2:24:20] spirit is real high but when something
[2:24:23] goes wrong your spirit drops and your
[2:24:27] spirit begins to say things that your
[2:24:30] soul don't agree
[2:24:31] with your spirit begins to say I cannot
[2:24:36] make it and your flesh says that's right
[2:24:40] you don't need to go to
[2:24:42] church but why are you here
[2:24:46] tonight why are you here tonight
[2:24:51] because underneath that flesh underneath
[2:24:55] that Spirit there is a soul and the soul
[2:24:59] is the real you and the Soul believes
[2:25:03] God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Child

[2:30:07] Gospel is the casting out of the
[2:30:13] devil now can I can I take my Liberty is
[2:30:16] that okay amen we're living in a day and
[2:30:19] time
[2:30:21] where people are trying to shut
[2:30:22] preachers
[2:30:24] down and put a tape player in the
[2:30:31] pit well if I was the
[2:30:34] devil I would want to shut up the
[2:30:36] ministry
[2:30:38] too because For the First
[2:30:41] Time underneath this
[2:30:44] message preachers finally have something
[2:30:46] to say
[2:30:50] we're not just
[2:30:51] running we're running with a
[2:30:54] message and it's the king's
[2:30:56] message and there's so much Authority in
[2:30:59] this
[2:31:01] message it's the scepter of the
[2:31:04] king that we can tell the
[2:31:06] devil get out of my way get out of my
[2:31:10] way get out of my way you know what I
[2:31:13] say I say Satan get out of my way I'm
[2:31:18] going on with Jesus
[2:31:20] I'm going on with a message I'm going on
[2:31:23] to a
[2:31:24] complete
[2:31:26] identification I'm going in the
[2:31:28] Rapture the power of Satan is in the
[2:31:31] hands of preachers to
[2:31:37] break that's a quote he said Lord you
[2:31:41] give us the divine power to break the
[2:31:44] power of Satan over this
[2:31:48] life somebody say this with
[2:31:51] me
[2:31:52] Satan
[2:31:54] power
[2:31:56] over not
[2:31:58] in this
[2:32:01] life I am lost the power of
[2:32:04] Satan over this
[2:32:06] life not in this
[2:32:14] life amen yes
[2:32:18] sir can I say this to you the devil is
[2:32:22] not in
[2:32:23] you he's hanging over
[2:32:28] you amen because he knows that you are a
[2:32:33] part of a Joshua
[2:32:36] generation he knows if there is a
[2:32:40] Joshua there's got to be a
[2:32:42] Caleb if there's a Joshua there's got to
[2:32:46] be a Caleb come on Joshua was the the
[2:32:49] end time leader Caleb was a type of the
[2:32:52] end time
[2:32:56] generation this message is our
[2:32:59] Joshua we are
[2:33:02] calebs and the devil knows if he can
[2:33:05] oppress us he can stop
[2:33:13] us can I say this to you there is a
[2:33:18] difference in Demon
[2:33:20] oppression and demon
[2:33:30] possession
[2:33:32] possession means he has got
[2:33:34] you
[2:33:36] oppression means he's trying to get
[2:33:40] [Applause]
[2:33:42] you if the devil has possessed
[2:33:46] you he's already got you
[2:33:50] but if he's oppressing you he's trying
[2:33:53] to get
[2:33:54] you you know what the devil says he says
[2:33:58] I'm going to get you I'm going to get
[2:34:00] you I'm going to get you I'm going to
[2:34:02] get you I'm going to get you I'm going
[2:34:05] to get you you know what I say you
[2:34:08] should have got me when you had a
[2:34:14] chance if the devil was going to get you
[2:34:17] he would have done got you
[2:34:19] [Applause]
[2:34:23] but he does not have the
[2:34:25] ability to get you because God already
[2:34:29] got
[2:34:34] you he got you from before the
[2:34:37] foundation of the
[2:34:46] world Glory Hallelujah
[2:34:50] will me prove it to you by the
[2:34:52] message the prophet of God said I didn't
[2:34:56] give my heart to God at a younger
[2:35:00] age because the spirit hung over
[2:35:05] me a spirit didn't get
[2:35:08] him it hung over him you know why that
[2:35:12] Spirit hangs over
[2:35:14] you is because that Spirit does not want
[2:35:18] you to go out yonder
[2:35:20] and fully believe the
[2:35:22] word because that devil
[2:35:25] knows if you believe what has been
[2:35:28] spoken it will become a
[2:35:34] [Applause]
[2:35:35] reality but the prophet
[2:35:41] of he said God gave me and every gospel
[2:35:46] preacher who will believe him the power
[2:35:50] and the authority to break that
[2:35:57] Spirit can I make an announcement to
[2:35:59] Satan in these
[2:36:03] meetings can I send a news alert to
[2:36:07] hell I believe with all my
[2:36:10] heart every demon power that's in here
[2:36:14] at this
[2:36:15] minute is already broken
[2:36:20] hallelujah it's already broken the power
[2:36:24] of Satan is already
[2:36:27] broken you want to go out yonder and
[2:36:29] believe the
[2:36:30] word it's time to do it you want to go
[2:36:34] out yonder and believe God can heal you
[2:36:37] it's time to do it it's time to believe
[2:36:40] the spoken word until it becomes a
[2:36:43] reality

[2:48:06] Minute doubting
[2:48:09] God he's
[2:48:13] here
[2:48:14] Joshua 40 years later entered the
[2:48:18] Promised Land
[2:48:20] as the great military
[2:48:22] General when he come up against his
[2:48:25] enemies they had walled into a
[2:48:28] place there was no way for him to get to
[2:48:31] them but by faith he looked at the
[2:48:35] Unseen because God gave Moses a
[2:48:39] promise while they were yet in
[2:48:43] Egypt did I read that
[2:48:47] right they were still in leay say I mean
[2:48:50] they were still in
[2:48:53] Egypt but God already gave them a
[2:48:58] promise I give you all of
[2:49:03] Palestine generation of the upright
[2:49:06] there has been a Joshua Among Us and a
[2:49:10] Moses Among Us and he said the land is

[2:49:27] parts of the
[2:49:29] journey but there was another part
[2:49:32] there which was a third part which was a
[2:49:35] third
[2:49:36] pull you know what he said he said
[2:49:39] that's where all the promises lay for
[2:49:41] the
[2:49:44] beli we're not going back to the first
[2:49:47] and second pool
[2:49:51] that was the permissive will of
[2:49:55] God but there is a perfect
[2:49:58] pool it's called the third
[2:50:01] pool and there is where all the promises
[2:50:06] L by faith Joshua saw the walls of
[2:50:11] Jericho laying flat on the
[2:50:14] ground why he seen the inv ible
[2:50:19] one and when people here

[2:50:30] unbelief but when you look at the chief
[2:50:33] Captain the world will lay flat at your
[2:50:37] feet and will shake away every fed of

[2:51:33] captain of the host of the Lord he
[2:51:37] hasn't even made it to the walls of
[2:51:40] Jericho
