[1:34:52] greetings prise the
[1:34:55] Lord we welcome you for our meetings
[1:34:57] when we have meetings please
[1:35:02] come when you had meetings here some of
[1:35:05] my young men
[1:35:10] came and for a few weeks I had a reval
[1:35:12] in my
[1:35:19] church praise the Lord
[1:35:24] this morning I want us to talk about
[1:35:26] giving the devil
[1:35:35] Advantage it doesn't look
[1:35:40] positive is it a good thing to give the
[1:35:42] devil an
[1:35:51] advantage you see
[1:35:56] says if you are in a
[1:36:01] contest you study your
[1:36:06] enemy you study the weak
[1:36:09] points and make advantage of the
[1:36:15] wi you you you you look at your Str
[1:36:19] strong
[1:36:21] points and take advantage you we strong
[1:36:27] points if there's two teams going to
[1:36:30] play let say
[1:36:35] foot and the opposing team will always
[1:36:39] take advantage of the other
[1:36:45] team if the back is
[1:36:50] weak the team is going to make maximum
[1:36:53] use of that
[1:36:57] wickedness if the team has a we
[1:37:04] goalkeeper the strikers are going to
[1:37:06] make use of
[1:37:10] that and if the if the weak if the team
[1:37:15] gives the opponent
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:21] Advantage some of the Advantage they may
[1:37:24] give to the opposing
[1:37:26] team can rep some of the advantages they
[1:37:31] can give the opposing
[1:37:38] team is making silly
[1:37:44] mistakes within the dangerous
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:51] Zone if you are going to handle the
[1:37:54] within the penalty
[1:37:59] area you are giving yourent an
[1:38:04] advantage so you avoid this silly
[1:38:07] mistakes around this dangerous
[1:38:13] Zone you don't play with the ball around
[1:38:16] the
[1:38:19] go because you give your open an
[1:38:22] advantage
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:28] so the devil and us are in a
[1:38:36] game and we Must Be
[1:38:41] watchful not to give him an
[1:38:46] advantage I believe in James 4 verse 7
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:55] if you can read it
[1:39:01] quickly this is what the Bible
[1:39:04] says are you
[1:39:07] there submit yourself therefore to
[1:39:13] God resist the devil and he will flee
[1:39:16] from
[1:39:21] you and I want you to notice
[1:39:25] we like to say resist the devil
[1:39:30] flee but before you resist the
[1:39:33] devil you must submit to
[1:39:37] God if you don't submit you can't
[1:39:43] resist so the whole game is submitting
[1:39:46] and
[1:39:52] resisting you are not willing to
[1:39:55] submit you are playing a weak
[1:40:00] game and many people lose this game
[1:40:02] because they don't want to
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:07] submit you don't want to submit to the
[1:40:11] word and when you don't meet the
[1:40:14] word the sisters the devil sees a
[1:40:20] weakness that he can't flee from you
[1:40:28] praise the
[1:40:29] Lord so you
[1:40:32] submit surrender to
[1:40:35] God surrender to his
[1:40:39] word and when you surrendered to
[1:40:43] God you were in a position to resist the
[1:40:49] devil when Jesus came to this earth
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] he came
[1:40:59] surrendered glory to
[1:41:01] God he came completely surrendered to
[1:41:06] God and when the devil came to
[1:41:09] tempt because he was fully
[1:41:14] surrender Jesus could tell the devil get
[1:41:18] behind it is
[1:41:20] written it is written
[1:41:23] Hallelujah why did he win that
[1:41:27] battle because look at the
[1:41:30] river he surrendered to
[1:41:33] God and God filled his
[1:41:36] life so much so that he said this is my
[1:41:42] beloved
[1:41:44] Son whom I well
[1:41:47] pleased hallelujah
[1:41:50] hallelujah you are not going to resist
[1:41:53] the
[1:41:58] devil the rule of this game is that you
[1:42:00] must
[1:42:07] fully many people want
[1:42:12] Victory and many people want to speak
[1:42:14] great
[1:42:17] things but so long as the devil has a
[1:42:20] chance to hit
[1:42:26] long as there's an opening where the
[1:42:28] devil
[1:42:36] can you open a gap and the devilit
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:43] you but the only way you can Mar to
[1:42:47] resist the
[1:42:50] devil resisting the devil
[1:42:55] saying no to the
[1:42:58] devil it is not
[1:43:01] possible it can't happen
[1:43:07] iused I say
[1:43:10] no the only way you can have such
[1:43:13] Authority is when you have yielded to
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:19] God give me a money fully yielded to God
[1:43:25] and I will show you a wi
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:33] now praise the name of the
[1:43:37] Lord

[1:43:41] submit give
[1:43:43] yourself give yourself to
[1:43:46] God surrender to his
[1:43:50] word the word

[1:51:25] saw the
[1:51:27] Egyptians their imagination

[1:54:08] know the reason why many people don't
[1:54:10] believe the what the word
[1:54:14] says
[1:54:16] because maybe through
[1:54:18] life they passed through difficult
[1:54:21] moments
[1:54:24] their lives have been
[1:54:26] Scar and these scars have gone in the
[1:54:38] conscience and
[1:54:41] so why they are
[1:54:44] Christians every time they want to make
[1:54:47] a
[1:54:48] move the devil go subconscious
[1:54:58] maybe something so
[1:55:01] bad and the devil does not want you to
[1:55:04] believe that God
[1:55:09] forg he wants you to believe you are

[1:55:43] forgiven glory to

[2:09:34] himself so
[2:09:38] listen we don't give the devil Advantage
[2:09:41] we can't open our
[2:09:44] mind and Satan
[2:09:47] cannot battle against that that no no
[2:09:59] word is
[2:10:00] in when the word is Tak the
[2:10:05] seat when the word has Tak
[2:10:14] that
[2:10:15] remember Jesus said when a demon is cast
[2:10:19] out of somebody
[2:10:22] he goes
[2:10:23] out to find
[2:10:27] place and when he does not
[2:10:31] find I'll go back to my
[2:10:35] house he
[2:10:37] comes and find
[2:10:45] that nobody sitting on
[2:10:52] are there some
[2:10:54] people who who have
[2:11:01] space that is a dangerous place to
[2:11:06] be because when he
[2:11:09] sees there is space nobody sees he goes
[2:11:14] to bring seven
[2:11:19] more and he comes and
[2:11:24] this
[2:11:28] a and he cleared
[2:11:31] himself he threw away
[2:11:34] for he left his his
[2:11:38] drinking his
[2:11:40] life
[2:11:42] his everything else was
[2:11:48] clean what mistake did he do
[2:11:52] he didn't open the
[2:11:54] door for somebody to come
[2:11:57] in come in Christ the Holy Ghost to
[2:12:02] come and when you stay as a believer in
[2:12:05] the
[2:12:06] church and the Holy Ghost is not in your
[2:12:10] life you are giving the devil an
[2:12:12] advantage
[2:12:17] over have you ever
[2:12:19] wondered people get sick
[2:12:22] and they were so
[2:12:23] happy they
[2:12:26] when but after some
[2:12:29] time
[2:12:33] quiet and what they
[2:12:36] do when they were making noise they were
[2:12:38] the
[2:12:40] front they now to the back
[2:12:47] of and you are the back because
[2:12:51] you an ADV the
[2:12:53] devil and you lost
[2:12:58] something that's
[2:13:01] right praise the
[2:13:09] Lord I hope you're not there for that
[2:13:17] reason but
[2:13:19] listen you see people
[2:13:24] shout they happy when the word
[2:13:28] is then something
[2:13:32] happen and they keep
[2:13:37] quiet and when the preacher is
[2:13:41] coming is as if he coming to
[2:13:46] circumcise it's Grievious
[2:13:51] is
[2:13:53] Grievious and you want what
[2:13:56] happen in my church I can tell you so
[2:13:58] and so
[2:14:03] it's because you see
[2:14:05] them you see
[2:14:09] them they let
[2:14:13] somewhere and the devil took
[2:14:22] yes
[2:14:23] sister take advantage of
[2:14:26] you I remember one time in my I was
[2:14:29] going to
[2:14:31] preach I woke up in the
[2:14:33] morning prepared very well went
[2:14:38] w every shirt I
[2:14:40] took there was something wrong
[2:14:43] with it was
[2:14:53] something the call was
[2:14:56] not and I went through all the
[2:15:01] church and I thought what is wrong
[2:15:05] to yes he will take advantage of small
[2:15:09] things
[2:15:12] before he can take
[2:15:16] advantage and wants you to have a before
[2:15:22] the simplest thing is to tell
[2:15:24] your what is wrong with
[2:15:26] you and have a small
[2:15:30] exchange and he has an
[2:15:33] advantage and when you come to church
[2:15:36] you are
[2:15:38] condemned how many couples come to
[2:15:45] church because the devil raised
[2:15:48] something and made them qu in
[2:15:52] morning maybe through
[2:16:02] breakfast am I alone in
[2:16:10] that so I looked around every sh was
[2:16:16] B then I said it can't be the Roans
[2:16:20] wrong
[2:16:21] I'll take
[2:16:25] and whether bad or
[2:16:30] not and I se
[2:16:36] that he didn't have the
[2:16:38] advantage he couldn't make me have
[2:16:41] a he couldn't have have me defile my
[2:16:45] soul and go to church feeling
[2:16:49] guilty today you are
[2:16:51] because you
[2:16:57] give you let the devil work on your

[2:18:19] sea
[2:18:21] 10,000 Devils of the

[2:19:05] Lord you get tired you get
[2:19:11] war and you get frustrated and get you
[2:19:14] get
[2:19:19] angry you are
[2:19:21] tired so you can speak
[2:19:25] anything devil takes advantage of
[2:19:29] that

[2:19:37] day that's what he did the
[2:19:39] devil
[2:19:43] Jesus he had been preaching the whole
[2:19:46] day and was war out
[2:19:50] and he went to the ship and La
[2:19:53] down and slept
[2:19:57] finished and the devil said now we've
[2:20:00] got
[2:20:02] it and he sent 10,000
[2:20:06] Devils there on the sea because there
[2:20:09] was a man

[2:37:02] [Music]
[2:37:05] paragraph
[2:37:07] paragraph let me see
[2:37:10] this paragraph 74
[2:37:17] paragraph it says
[2:37:20] the
[2:37:22] spirit let's get
[2:37:24] it the spirit has one
[2:37:29] sense is
[2:37:31] either dominates
[2:37:43] it or doubt
[2:37:47] [Music]
[2:37:52] exactly and there is only one Avenue to
[2:37:57] e that is free
[2:38:02] moral you accept
[2:38:05] doubt or you can accept
[2:38:08] Faith either you one you
[2:38:15] want see therefore
[2:38:19] Satan begins at the principle
[2:38:23] part to call the spirit of
[2:38:30] man
[2:38:32] knows if I can
[2:38:37] here get
[2:38:39] here because there are two
[2:38:42] things faith if he believes I'm I'm
[2:38:46] finished if this man believes I'm
[2:38:49] finished
[2:38:53] so it is either he
[2:38:55] believes or he
[2:39:02] doubt do you know why what the
[2:39:07] does he preaches to
[2:39:13] you when he came to Adam in the G of
[2:39:17] Eden he came with a good
[2:39:23] maybe titled
[2:39:25] it what
[2:39:27] God today we are going to talk
[2:39:31] about said did God
[2:39:34] say you not eat of all
[2:39:40] the he said
[2:39:43] no he didn't actually say that he said
[2:39:47] we can eat over all the trees
[2:39:51] but except of the tree
[2:39:53] of that is in the middle of the garden
[2:39:57] the fruit of the tree in the middle of
[2:39:59] the
[2:40:01] garden that one we should
[2:40:07] not we do
[2:40:09] that
[2:40:12] we the devil say praise the
[2:40:16] Lord praise the
[2:40:18] Lord you will not surely
[2:40:22] die you will not surely die in other
[2:40:26] words God is not saying the
[2:40:30] truth be
[2:40:32] [Music]
[2:40:43] reasonable you not
[2:40:45] surely he just meant something in the in
[2:40:47] between
[2:40:52] and he right into the
[2:40:54] face is
[2:40:56] it and so she did what the devil did
[2:41:00] because she doubted what God Said She
[2:41:03] doubted she was
[2:41:07] surely and today can make you doubt what
[2:41:12] say what God says about
[2:41:15] your what God says about
[2:41:17] your what says about you the things you
[2:41:22] need what God says about your spiritual
[2:41:26] security God says about
[2:41:29] Grace what God says about your
[2:41:33] life if he can make you doubt your
[2:41:39] destiny and show you you are even lost
[2:41:43] already and God does not mean you are
[2:41:46] the people to go the
[2:41:49] people like you like
[2:41:52] you mean
[2:41:55] like is not for
[2:41:59] people and it makes you say okay yeah I
[2:42:02] can see I can see even my my
[2:42:06] history I came from I can see it is true
[2:42:11] it is true God could not be meaning
[2:42:13] somebody like
[2:42:15] me and once you accept what the devil is
[2:42:18] saying because you doubted
[2:42:21] God you doubt what God
[2:42:27] say God will come and take you Satan
[2:42:29] will come and take
[2:42:31] you and mess you
[2:42:34] up get in your
[2:42:37] mind because he God has given you the
[2:42:40] freedom to
[2:42:42] choose that is a very good
[2:42:45] thing you can choose to be a very
[2:42:47] spiritual sister
[2:42:51] God has given you the freedom and there
[2:42:53] are two
[2:42:54] choices there are two
[2:42:56] choices every question there are two
[2:43:00] choices there is God's
[2:43:02] choice and there's Devil's
[2:43:04] choice if you believe what God
[2:43:06] says you take What God
[2:43:09] Says and when you take what God
[2:43:12] says you have the
[2:43:15] victory you have more than a
[2:43:18] conqueror Hallelujah you are
[2:43:23] winner but if you look at what the devil
[2:43:26] is
[2:43:27] giving and you see the
[2:43:29] shadows and you see the
[2:43:32] doubt and you see the
[2:43:34] reason and your imagination brings
[2:43:37] you and your memory bring the
[2:43:42] past what the devil is a hisory
[2:43:53] and you will come around with your
[2:43:56] history and tell you what he used to

[3:03:49] you stop a
[3:03:53] little you stop at that door for a short
[3:03:59] time where he used to
[3:04:04] go remember somebody s and said the
[3:04:06] things I used to do I don't do them
[3:04:10] anymore because there is a big change in
[3:04:12] my
[3:04:15] heart but yet say the the church age
[3:04:20] book that it will come a
[3:04:22] time when the second generation comes
[3:04:26] in that desire for God goes
[3:04:32] away that Ze for the
[3:04:36] Lord and the things they never used to
[3:04:40] do they begin to do them and the things

[3:05:06] ey say is my
[3:05:09] day you have a day of
[3:05:11] your and you open the the gate to
[3:05:15] the no wonder we as powerful
[3:05:19] as the church cannot move the
[3:05:25] of this church ought to be a
[3:05:29] power this church ought to be an
[3:05:35] armyy
[3:05:38] defeated but what
[3:05:42] happened we open the
[3:05:45] door and Satan came in
[3:05:50] and P cold cold
[3:05:55] water and what do we

[3:06:49] that picture did something to your
[3:06:52] mind it is behind your
[3:06:54] subconscious did something to
[3:06:57] you that gosp did something to
[3:07:01] you it influences your
[3:07:04] decision you think nothing
[3:07:07] happened something happened
[3:07:10] inside
[3:07:12] okay you just think it don't it already
[3:07:14] got you right there that's just as good
[3:07:16] as he wants right there how many ever
[3:07:18] know Nelly Sanders well I guess I lot of
[3:07:21] you said she said well you know what
[3:07:24] said maybe if I walk up on the steps up
[3:07:27] there said maybe I'll be able to testify
[3:07:30] to some of them oh see you are right on
[3:07:33] the Devil's Ground stay out of it shine
[3:07:36] the very appearance of
[3:07:38] evil and I want to tell you that's what
[3:07:40] we
[3:07:42] do we want to get that pleas
[3:07:47] we'll testify to
[3:07:51] them one of the small things I knew when
[3:07:54] we were small young
[3:07:59] Christians never went to believer
[3:08:07] party tell us come
[3:08:11] you never come
[3:08:14] there sometimes we have business deals
[3:08:19] somebody tells let's me that
[3:08:24] that I never go
[3:08:30] to why that is the Devil's
[3:08:34] Ground And when you go the Devil's
[3:08:39] Ground you give the devil an
[3:08:45] advantage have the home ground always
[3:08:49] play your game with the home
[3:08:57] ground oh you
[3:08:59] think if I go into that CH that
[3:09:04] Society I tell them the
[3:09:08] word keep
[3:09:11] away that the Devil's
[3:09:15] Ground that the Devil's Ground
[3:09:18] and the mistake you do is to get
[3:09:22] there and the devil has a home
[3:09:25] ground advantage over
[3:09:30] you yes brother but but she walked up
[3:09:35] the top of the steps and stood there for

[3:18:06] you have had
[3:18:12] today many of these things
[3:18:17] as spirits and
[3:18:20] demons we don't even get to realize
[3:18:25] it did you know that listening to the
[3:18:28] music of the world you give an advantage
[3:18:31] to the
[3:18:36] enemy and it brings demons in
[3:18:42] [Music]
[3:18:44] you this woman near just went close CL
[3:18:47] just
[3:18:51] close to this bar and D
[3:18:57] party and she thought she would just
[3:18:59] listen for just a
[3:19:02] moment just a little
[3:19:06] bit but you know she was drawn away into
[3:19:09] the arms of this
[3:19:14] man it is just so surprising but true
[3:19:19] true that those demons entered her right
[3:19:23] there and when she came to
[3:19:27] herself she run as quick as
[3:19:30] possible the middle of the
[3:19:33] night rush to where brother bam
[3:19:37] was knock the door and the
[3:19:41] door she was a child of God but she was
[3:19:45] possessed by wrong spirits
[3:19:48] because she had given an advantage to
[3:19:49] the
[3:19:52] devil and right there you might think
[3:19:54] that brother bham would just say it's
[3:19:56] all right you are
[3:19:59] fine but he realized there are
[3:20:03] spirits there are
[3:20:05] demons that were in
[3:20:07] her and he began to cast them out and
[3:20:11] this is so real
[3:20:13] friends he said it came out of her as a
[3:20:15] big butt
[3:20:20] [Music]
[3:20:30] and as a big
[3:20:31] [Music]
[3:20:32] Shadow and when it came out of
[3:20:35] her went straight to attack brother
[3:20:39] BR and he said oh Lord
[3:20:42] God the blood of Jesus protect me from
[3:20:45] that
[3:20:47] friends this was a
[3:20:49] battle and Wayne who was sleeping in the
[3:20:51] bed jumped out of the
[3:20:54] bed and here it was like a big
[3:20:58] Shadow it circled
[3:21:01] around and went over and went down
[3:21:03] behind the
[3:21:05] bed out of the bed went
[3:21:09] Wayne Wayne ran into the next room as as
[3:21:15] it friend it was a
[3:21:19] battle the devil is roaming
[3:21:22] around trying to see who he will be able
[3:21:25] to
[3:21:26] get but he can't get you if you are in
[3:21:28] the
[3:21:30] word if you in the right
[3:21:32] ground where you
[3:21:35] belong there are certain decisions you
[3:21:37] make you need to make

[3:49:03] fast right here in this presence in this
[3:49:08] atmosphere the Lord can meet

[3:49:57] music that appetite that you have to go
[3:50:00] in a dance party or whatever it
[3:50:04] is dies

[3:50:17] videos
[3:50:20] noer your affection is now on things
