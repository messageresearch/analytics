to come to him with praise on our lips second Peter those of you who don't know where second Peter is it's just close to Revelation close to First John and [Music] revelation Martin you would need to help on this sometimes you forget to switch on this and we burning up here praise God so we just go to chapter three vers uh 3 to 14 actually begin which I stir up your pure Minds by by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the of the uh excuse me that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and our savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lasts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were are from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and petion of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some not willing that any should perish but that all should come to the to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for a Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth where in dwelleth righteousness where beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace not as an interpreter but read it for the [Music] [Music] for [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] for [Music] fore let's pray Lord Jesus we have read a portion of your word this evening no doubt there are many going to be under the sound of my voice this evening nothing of myself Lord that I can give the people Lord who have come from many different direction Lord to come and here Lord need myself we all need this and I pray Lord that if you can just come and take over help me Lord to open my heart and my mind myps Lord use The Interpreter speak to each of us Lord let every person that is in into the service tonight may you use their hearing ability to be able to get to their spirit and soul lord if there is a sinner that they will be saved if there is a backslider they might be repent if there is one Lord who has not yet been filled with the spirit father Lord may you fill us with feel each one of us Lord your coming is at hand are realize there is a time that is coming when preachers will no longer have to prepare for sermons people will no longer need to go to church because preaching will be over and the Rapture will have come but how shall we be found on that day Lord I pray that you will help us this evening give more honest he Lord help us oh God and even that brother that sister that has not been very serious Lord maybe trying to play Church you meet them fur tonight Lord maybe they've not they've been coming to church but not really hearing what the spirit say to them them Lord that they will open their hearts and that you will speak to them directly and that they will meet you father we commit the service into your hands in the lovely name of Jesus Amen you may be seated please praise God Brother Martin is this going to work okay so uh this evening I'm speaking on um and I'm wondering whether okay I see I did not share that with you uh brother Isaac I just Tred to send it now okay so I'm speaking on scoffers in the last days scoffers in the last days and I'm taking that out of uh vers three which said knowing this fast there shall come in the last days cof all right and for an inspiration uh like to tell you that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise tell your neighbor the Lord is not slack concerning his promise amen and that is taken from another verse down there vers n the Lord is not slack concerning his promise praise the name of the Lord and so we see that we some of you have come to church for uh 3 years others four others five others 10 others 20 others 30 when when this end time message came uh in Uganda and a few people received it I'll tell you what happened many of them did not think that they will continue on for the next two or three before the coming of the Lord and so so they never encourage their people to work or to go to school um and this is real you find that many people did not go to school uh many Believers did not um you know seek after the wealth of the world um you know they considered those things to be of the world so they considered thatth you know people you know giving in marriage and getting married it was worldly and that's why even up to now many uh or some I would say of the of the pastors are biased when young people want to get married it's like as if it is a worldly thing yet for them they are married but you see uh it was not coming from a negative [Music] attitude it was coming from a positive spiritual attitude that you know the coming of the Lord is at hand and as it was in the days of Lord and as it was in the days of nor so shall it be you know when the son of man and we see that you know what were they doing then they were marrying and giving in marriage and trading and kind of things and so out of that the people or the Believers concern were concerned with the coming of the Lord only whereas the Pentecostal religion or the Pentecostal denomination went on the other direction you know they went on the direction that you know God wants to prosper you God wants you to be in good health and wealth and that you know God wants to uh you know bless you and and you know they preached prosperity and they they measured on that and indeed they have prospered how many can agree with me that they have prospered and so um whereas the Believers now feared that area because apparently according to them you know the Lord was coming very soon and we did not have time to go to make money or to go you know to pray for miracles or money or wealth or or or good life on Earth it was even so that for a Believer to drive a good car was like a sin for a Believer to save up money and you go to a hotel somewhere with your family for some vacational time off was [Music] hilarious those are things of the world and anytime Jesus is coming and and so believe were really serious and they really meant it and many of them now going back 50 years ago passed away and and gone to their reward so we we know that we are sure like they were waiting upon the coming of the Lord they preached the coming of the Lord and they lived the life and I want you to read listen to me carefully this evening they the life of this message that's one thing notable about the old time believers they were very sweet people really meant what they preached and they they lived it in their own life they had genuine love they belied in Holiness and practiced Holiness you know they loved each other you know brother you would just travel and a brother meet you somewhere you would say oh you a brother and when when you realize someone is a brother you are so so happy I even remember when we you know when I believe not many years ago about 18 years ago going on the internet and you you know somehow on your messenger or something you bump into a Believer and you tells you is a believer of the message and you know you also tell him the same you would be so happy you know that You' met a brother you quick sa his contact and you can always you know talk and chat and talk about the Lord and you know people were really more serious in the in the days going by but you see but also we had especially here in Africa we did not have the full councel of the message because we had bits and pieces of the message books you know you find that many Believers even ministers did not have the whole library of the message but what they did have they had um question and answers books and some Believers would put on quote books put quote books together and then they would print it as a book from from America they would send those quote books and believer would read those quote books and you know things like that and so to even we had many pastors who had never listened to the message of brother I hope now we do not have any we in the past put up a project of the message player to try and distribute this to pastors and Believers and out of that there hundreds of pastors and ministers who have been benefited out of that well now we have smartphones and we have tablets and ipop and so we now have the full CC of the message We Now understand the whole message someone cannot just come up and say the prophet said you can you know just quickly search it even while he's speaking it and see whether it is there or not and so preachers now are cautious they don't just say the the prophet say because they are sure that the people know what the prophet said either they know because they have read or they know that they can be able to search it and so because we have now understood the message more we now understood the message was not all about the spiritual things that the message was both for the spiritual prosperity and for the physical prosperity that I can come to you and preach to you miracles amen and we say amen I can come to you and preach to you that God is going to visit you and bless you so I can preach the Prosperity Gospel using this same message that we believe and I I can preach the Rapture and the coming of the Lord but now friends listen to me it has come to a place where many Believers have now you know come to a place where they have forgotten the real purpose of the message you know we think sometimes that the message is all about um you know some Revelations oh the message is God sent a prophet how many here believe that God sent a prophet believe we believe that God sent a prophet but our message is not God sent a prophet our message is more than that our message is more than God our message is the message that God gave to the prophet to bring to our generation and so to say that God sent a prophet is not a big revelation [Music] because we believe it and we have seen it in the scripture the word of God but there is more amen let us not be distracted by the brother I want us to just follow what I'm saying praise the name of the Lord there's something I'm trying to come to and I'm trying to drive to it I want your undivided attention brother if that thing won't work just forget it because I don't want to be interrupted this evening praise the name of the Lord something really that is burning on my heart to share with the church I just give the brother a moment to get done with what he's [Music] doing speaker I can have the speaker that's what you're to praise the Lord in the last days so now when someone asks you what is the message the message is more than deep Revelations of the word message is not is not knowledge of of big Mysteries the message is part of that but more than that are you hearing me Church message is not just um you know the Seven Seals or the church ages or you know these things that you can put in your head right now if you go to Google you can actually search any part of the message and you will find it and Google will tell you everything the message says but that does not mean that Google is going has all the message even messages that I've never read messages that I read and forgot my iPad here has everything but when the Rapture comes my iPad will be left behind I am actually going in the Rapture so then see knowledge is not what takes us in the Rapture what takes us in the Rapture is something more than knowledge what takes us in the Rapture is the life of this message and if we cannot be able to live the life then you cannot claim to be a believer of this message if you cannot leave up to the standards of the message then we cannot claim that we have heard or received the message but the Bible here now the way I want to approach it here is that the Bible speaks of scoffers in the last days we will go through this these Verses first of all knowing this that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so now what I want to speak about this evening is that we have come to a place where many Believers of this message have forgotten the real purpose of the message what is the purpose of the message what differentiates you from the Pentecostal [Music] denomination why are we not attending in Miracle why are we not not going to some of these good churches for God's sake they have good buildings they have more people you know they have more money it appears they have more blessings why don't we just close down our small Lighthouse and and join them some of us came from established denominations we would have become you know great religious leaders but why did we leave why did we come in the message why why are you in the message now do not forget the reason why you were here if you you were born in the message and you eventually believe the message I I should change that statement right away if you were born in a family that believes the message and you eventually believe the message yourself ask yourself why did you believe the message did you believe because there were no other better people that you could see or you know actually there are many people out there that are better than people who are in the message people that will help you in the message you can even find a brother a brother who cannot even help [Music] you but how dare you find people who are doing great charitable work and many Believers don't even want to think about charity anymore and yet the Bible says that charity is true religion is that right church so what I'm trying to say is the why we are in the message is not because we have better people here it's not because we have more money here it's not because you know here you are going to find you know more perfect individuals that our Revelations are more better and it makes us more happy but we came in the message because we found that it was bitter HS which was going to give us a desired goal our desired goal is the rapture our desired goal is a aining the promise we have been given a promise the reason why Jesus came on Earth and he died the reason why he died and he rose again so that we might also die and rise again like he died and rose again amen we believe the message so we might attain the Resurrection The main thing in the message is the rapture is just detailed information and if you are not prepared for the Rapture every day of your life then you've not found the message if you feel whenever you come to church you don't come closer to the to the Lord if your life does not change amen if you cannot come to that place why you say well I'm am [Music] blameless spotless then you've not come in the message the message is a and the thing to make you spotless the mess is to make you blameless by faith because when you believe you receive the power to be when you believe you receive the power to become what you were not able to become amen and the promise that God gave promise of his coming because when he was on Earth he said I go but I shall come back and amen take you to myself so we believe he's coming again amen it's not a myth it is not a story it is a reality Jesus is coming back again Jesus is coming back again preachers no longer want to talk about but let me tell you this message is all about this message is all about the second coming of Jesus Christ that's what the seal is about that's what the church is about that's what the weeks of Daniel about that's what every Revelation in the Bible is about is about the bride who came from eternity going back to Eternity that's what it's all about and the coming of Jesus only to prepare you and me for that going away for that catching away but because it has taken so many years since the prophet came and went in the first few years people didn't even want to go to school why the Rapture is going to happen any time people didn't even want to get married oh because they wanted to marry so fast why because the r com you know people didn't want to work why the rupt is coming soon they would look down on people who have something in in this life and tell them brother you are leaving all these things here you better share it with everyone and when you go in the book of Acts what do you find in the book of Acts you know Believers th all their wealth and they shared it equally among themselves have you ever read that in the Bible if you haven't go back and read it that's what they did in the first church and so Believers 20 30 40 years ago they were almost like that they were so together love was so real because they believed that Jesus is coming back again even Paul himself the angel messenger of the first church he died believing Jesus is coming in his generation because he said we which are alive and remain so every believer that has ever lived before us they lived without conscience that Jesus is coming anytime soon amen they would go to pray and fasting they would go to reading the word they always wanted to live holy they always wanted their mind to be focused on the word of God even when they sinned in their imagination they would go and fast and pray for that God take away oh God fill me with the power but what is happening in our own generation Believers have forgotten the real reason why they are believers you find Believers no longer pray Believers eat and eat and eat Believers no longer fast even Believers even in church when we preach about the coming of the Lord they begin doing they begin getting B because they they have forgotten the reason why we are believer when you find Believers are playing around with sin imagine believer playing around with s going around and behaving like others and you come in church and you're conforted you know it used to be in the past that someone was a Believer or they were not and even when a brother did something and I know I've spoken against that I know and and you know the Deon needs to help me on that young lady she she doesn't need to go out now listen praise the name of the Lord I've spoken against this but they were doing it for a reason when a Believer would they would immediately arrest him arrest him bring them before the church confess what you have done it was the wrong way of doing [Music] it but there were filled with passion to keep the message and the word holy to keep the word right to keep themselves right because they did not want no a before them you know when a is in the camp the glory of God departs are you hearing me chch they wanted to be right with God they wanted to stand right with God and but what we find today we find a lot of [Music] Hypocrites why we have forgotten we have forgotten the reason why we are beli we are believers because we are meant to be special we are meant to hold the standard too high higher than thein you know what amen what what Jesus said to the disciples he said if you are righteous if your Holiness will not go beyond that of the of the religious people yeah if it do not go beyond that of who are they if it is not beyond that now that you not even started yet who are the Pharisees of today they the religious people the church people the Pentecostal denominations angan denominations Catholic denominations theti denominations all these they our religious phes and if you who claim to believe this end message if your faith does not go beyond if your life does not is not better or Beyond theirs you can't call yourself a Believer you must be in a place where amen you are the standard today listen to me I believe with all my heart that the True Believers of this message are filled with the Holy Ghost amen must be the standard today because what is the standard the standard is Christ and where is Christ Christ is in his own world and in every generation Christ is revealed in his own word because it's the word of the hour and the word of the hour today has come through the lips of our Prophet to prepare us for the coming of the Lord there is a group of people that are being prepared for the coming of the Lord every day they're being shed every being sh the world is being cut away from them every day we are coming Clos Jesus so now it must come to a place when we walk out into the world the world will not see me the world will see Christ I must be D standard you must be the standard and if you are not then you are joining the scoffers the Bible says there will be scoffers in the last days who are the scof the SCS are those who know the truth but they believe alive they know that Jesus is to come back again but because it takes so long they reach a place and say since my great grandfather how many years 40 no things have been the same way ever since is Jesus really coming back again let me tell you if you believe that Jesus is coming back again you are life will testify but if your life is doing something different then you don't believe it well you know it but you don't believe it but if you believe Jesus is coming back again every hour of your life every day of your life you are going to live conscious of you're going to live believing and knowing any time Jesus will come anytime Jesus is coming am I ready for his coming am I ready for his coming if if he should come now are you ready for his coming if you are not ready then you need to be ready the Bible says for this they willingly are ignorant of they willingly they ignorant of it willingly that by the word of God the heavens were of all and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished amen but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept inore reserved reserved what are they reserved to it is reserved unto fire against the day of judgment so fire is coming these things have been going through my mind you know the Hall of this past week and a few days Believers we leaving as if we do not believe that the coming of the Lord is real fire is coming we're not even talking about Hell Fire here we're talking about the fire that is going to come and burn this world it will burn all the proud read your Bible Mal 3 it will burn all the proud it will burn all that do wickedly it will burn them up the Lord fire is coming this Earth is reserved to the to fire is reserved un the fire against the day of judgment and pedition of ungodly men and that's why before that happens God because of his love sent end time message what is the end time message it is a message of preparation a preparing us preparing us for the coming of the Lord preparing us to be saved from the fires preparing us from the fires that are coming down preparing us from the judgments of God and if you are not ready you will not go and if you hear this message and you live the life of this message you are going to be made ready the Bible in the Book of Revelation chter 19 I believe amen he says the bride has made our ready the bride is ready we are ready by the word we are ready by the revealed word of the hour let me tell you it's time for us to be ready make yourself ready make your family ready make your children ready amen if there was a time for us to go to church this is the time time for us to pray it is the time there was no more time coming if there was the time for you young men to be serious God means to forsake everything else do it be on fire for God because to be on fire for God is a decision you make to be on fire for God a choice you take there is no power in Hell or in Heaven Can hinder you from doing that because the price has already been paid whoever wants to drink of can come and drink whoever wants the Holy Ghost can come and drink I believe this is the time if there was any shouting to be this is the time to shout pray time to because I tell you people who go to the they go praying they go shouting they go ning when the door was sh those who were on the outside were are praying shouting nashing the teeth let me tell you because time was over but now is the time for us to pray and do whatever we need to do right with God because if we don't we may have another opportunity praise the name of the Lord the message is all about the coming of the lord it's not our E I understand it is by his grace but you see what his grace does his grace doesn't take you into disgrace his grace makes you to fear his grace brings you to a place of surrender his grace brings you the realization brings you Revelation brings you understanding amen brings you you know his Spirit as long as you open your heart that's what his grace does and he continues on to say but beloved be uh not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as thousand years and thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise when you talk about SC now in the Greek the word is called empac which is to mean a the writer that is by implication a false teacher a moer one that expresses [Music] contempt contempt for what you believe contempt for what you stand for one that ridicules what you believe laugh at it scones at it you know at it you know joking jokes about it teases you for what you believe the Bible says there will be these people who are scers in the last we are going to have many people who ridicule us for what we stand people are going to mock us for what we you know people who are going to Jer at us or you know joke at with us and tease us call at us but I'll tell you why they do that because they do not recognize the their day and the message and for anyone who knowing what the Bible and the word of God says goes and does something will actually trying to SC at the word and that's why the Bible actually says that having received the light having receiv received the revelation of the word having received the mystery of the word and being rece enlightened and then you fall away you SC at it said two things one he said that you are taking Jesus Christ again on the cross and he says you're putting him to open shame number two he says they shall never be forgiven meaning they they cannot be restored gained repentance you can inter that scripture that's all right you can interpret it your way I just parhas it for you what does it show the Bible speaks about the scoffers those that will scof the word when you know what the word says but then you you laugh at it you joke about it you tease others who believe it you ridic them listen carefully 1964 recognizing your day and its message and also the Simplicity of the message and the messenger Noah wasn't scientific he wasn't uneducated man he was a poor farmer humble with a simple message it was too simple for their High Learning this message is too simple so it is so is it today God always makes it simple to get the people who will believe and trust him God is not looking for people who can reason God is looking for people who are simple and who will believe the word and who will trust God and take him at his word it's a different just a simple message a different message it says but the same God now I want you to believe it and understand that God has spoken Jesus said they sced at his Prophet they sced that no his prophet and as they scoffed in that day so will they do it again is coming God has sent a prophet to us and people have scoffed at him you go all over the Internet we have had preachers who have come and sced at William because of what he T they could not find one thing in his on they could not say he committed doubt they could not say he he he begged for money or he stole money they could not say you know he preached you know he lived a wrong kind of Life they could not say that do you know why because the God that was in him enabled him to live the life even with all the possibility of him taking the money William would have bued one of the biggest religious organizations the 19th century if he had taken the direction of many preachers but he knew his calling others became Rich because of you but he refused the riches because he knew if he gets the riches they will divert his anation from his God cold mission they gave him a very beautiful car he said how can I drive it and go preach to you know a sick woman or a very old poor woman how can I do that and he packed it away in his one man brought a check of I don't remember how much it was 2 million or something like yes 196 that's a lot of money today a lot of money they brought it to him gave it to him he refused it and the man decided to come again in the prayer L as if he was going to be prayed for and he gave him the check said I told Brother which preer could do that and those same preachers who are stealing money from people and they buying private jets standing up on their saying was a they scoffers don't stoop down to their level don't be deceived who is a liar they are the Liars that he went wrong when you ask them where did he they will tell you oh because he preached this he preached that it is because the message was different the message was so simple that the high minded could not receive it could not I saw a preacher here in and he said oh you know I met one of my daughters and she told me she's now going to another church and I found her looking bad looking so bad and I asked her why you she said uh you know in our new church we don't wear earrings we don't use makeup we don't dress you know in those and then this pastor told her all these people they going to run mad with Jesus and then he told the people they would be surprised to find to find us in heaven when we're using our makeup and all the women with those long nails like a c and make up on their you heard them shout [Music] [Applause] after what are they doing they are scers they are scorning at the word it's not a church doctrine it is a world best teaching and any Pastor who want preach it he has no backbone for the world I tell you if you're going to be in a heaven it will be another Heaven not my heaven where I am going noten where went where went where went were Godly women it will be a heaven where where Jezebel went the heaven where the saints of God went there won't be any unclean thing there there won't be any worldl there there won't be fornicators there won't be amen there won't be immorality and the Bible say all the immortal they have their place in the Lake of Fire by the heaven where I am going amen only the holy will walk holy without SP without rink washed in the blood we were like them but when we came the blood the blood which is the word changed us when we baptized with the Holy Ghost bur away all uncleanness and that's why that's why we can boldly say we are going to heaven hallelujah hallelujah amen not our Holiness his Holiness what is his Holiness his Holiness is the word of God not your church teachings not your pastor sen it is the word of God the word of God is the Holiness of God the Bible says our own Holiness our own of rightness they are filthy rugs but his word gives us his holy hallu praise God it's a different message it's the same God but I want you to believe it and understand that God has said it Jesus said the SC that his Prophet Noah as they sced in that day so will they do it again at his com they would do the same thing that's the reason that Pharaoh drowned in the sea why did Pharaoh drown in the sea he never recognized his day this is not the day of men this is not the day of churches this is not the day of denominations this is not the day of is this is the day where God is calling his sending his message say come out of her my people do not partakers of our this is this day we are living in praise God and never recogniz his day today they can't recognize the day we living he never recognized what was going on he was too hook up in the achievements of his scientific [Music] age to build cities with slave labor too busy to recognize the opportunity that he had and he turned God his Prophet messenger he turned him out into the Wilderness my good Lord God help us this is what the denominations are doing today they taking God his Prophet messenger by the way William Bram William Bram is not our Prophet only is a prophet of a whole Generation all this generation let me tell you if you did not know since the second world war there was no Revival until came on the that's when when we had a worldwide charismatic there is no powerful preacher today that has not either read or listened some or all of the messages of brother but what have they done they turn him into the Wilderness they trash it away we have one of our prominent preacher here in Cala I don't like mentioning names but I'm being tempted right now and some of us saw him and we knew he had been following brother brother we we we had been seeing but I had never mentioned brother until one day shamelessly he came out and said William Will man of God oh yes he was oh the way he was talking about you was not someone who heard about him was someone who had read and [Music] started so they know don't be deceived they know I say they know but what do they do they trash this message with his message Into the Wilderness but who is in the wilderness people in the wildness who is in the wordness oh my God Moses was in the word went in the Jesus went in the the children of Israel went in the where is the bride the Bri has been sidelined she's been pushed into the wildness but let me tell you something good is going to happen amen something is good is we are after the widerness after the wi that is something coming amen there is a Rapture there is the promised land after the wildness but don't you worry even when you are in the wildness the P of fire is right here with us God is with us and even if they claim the messages they can't debate with the light they can't debate with the life they can't debate with the life we are living let me tell the devil has ideas the devil can preach the devil can talk the devil can preach everything I'm Hallelujah but the devil has no power to live the life of the world and only in the message you are going to find people Souls Believers and preachers life are going to live the life of the world and when these false preachers begin to talk against the message just wash their lives Jesus said You shall know them by their fuit you may claim to believe this message but I don't want to hear that I want to see your life your life shout so loud that I can't hear your testimony your testimony will show what you believe praise God he never recognized this day he didn't recognize it that's the reason that things went the way they did he never recognized it if you would have only recognized the promised word of God and if the churches today would only recognize if the churches would only recognize the word of God made his This Promise for this hour this hour to the people they would not perish if you recognize the time we are living in and the word we are promising this listen to me church this message is more than Prosperity Gospel this message is more than you can do it this are you hearing this message is more than Miracles is more than power is more than signs and wonders this message is the life of Jesus and if you don't have that life in you you have not yet received it and you will perish for sure but I tell you the door is not yet closed God is still gashing out his life amen his life people that will hear this message listen you don't have to remain a luk one believer you don't have to you don't have to say I'm always Defeated come on put God on the line here go in your private prayers tell him God if what I've heard is the truth then give me the holy ghost power let me be changed once and for all I want to see your life living in me let me tell you if you challenge God God will fill you with all God is looking for people that are going to challenge him how will you challenge him you need to be desperate know you need to be desperate you need to be desperate you know like when amen this man amen went on on this PO pillar samon he had sined in knew but knew there was a god there was a God that met his parents down and he wanted to see that God he said now God he was on that P he said now God I'm crying to you this one more time amen give me back my strength was it possible according to the word it was not possible don't doubt what you had according to the word it was not possible according to the word are you hearing because the word said do not ever let him shave his [Music] hair ha was a Sy power and to cut it you had broken the V of being a Naz once The Vow is broken God did not have any obligation because you've not kept your part he won't keep his part but he was a desperate man I don't care what is written or what is Unwritten all I care about is that I have a heart that is Desiring I have a heart that is empty and I want that heart to be fed said God restore my strength praise God and strength came back and he died with the phis let me tell you that's what Believers need to do you need to challenge God you need to challenge God if you are sick sometimes it takes that desperation forget about this churchianity others you know you know you know your emotions come you happy I'm talking about individual prayer time devotional time desperation and you say now God it's time for us to have business I am here read your Bible all the men of old did that God loves that God is a man of war God hasn't like soft people oh please God just give me the hly ghost God doesn't like that God doesn't like s God likes man with God likes man like jaob who could meet him and say I am not leaving you said don't leave me let me go I'm not leaving you until you bless I am not leaving you that was a man with a B that was a man who was desperate because the situation before him was a matter of life and death and he knew his brother will kill him he need a superow he need to be charged by an anointing from above by the power of the Holy Ghost are you hearing me he said I'm not leaving you I am not leaving you until you bless and if you think God is going to change you I take that habit away from you when you can't even pray forget it you need to be desperate you need to come to him in pray yes the Bible says work out your salvation with fear and trembl praise God people fail to recognize their day and what is the message of our day is to prepare for his second coming he is coming soon let us be ready to meet him let us put aside every weight let us amen repent amen what you need to repent of make your life right with him be filled with the Holy Ghost amen go about your every day but watching and waiting in the days of John wisley men left their homes and they went overseas you to car the message of their they gave their life to the cause of Christ they died amen so that dis spok in the days of Martin Luther men were ready to be burned because of The Truth Listen to Me sisters brothers imagine a man accepting to die because of the truth believes in man like the man who translated this Bible the Catholic Church bned him with fire not Holy Ghost Fire Fire w they they tied him and they bur him and the man died and you you are just there me the they were ready to lose their life men were ready to be burned because of the truth they kept the scripture pure oh that's why we sing the song is dripping with blood yes he dripping with blood this Holy Ghost gopel is dripping with blood the blood of dis who died for the truth this holy gopel is dripping with blood men have given their blood men have given their life for this pure message for the the knowledge they had of these their day and his message these died in FA the scripture says they will rise fast they that are dead in Christ shall rise fast you believe that they didn't die in vain we are going to meet them at this precious message which we are preaching to you today men have given their life for and you you are here playing with how can you stand with them how you are a joker you cannot you need to come to a place of to surrender and Lord fill me with I can't die like tind I may not die you know like this and that I may not die but Lord I'm ready to die if it takes death I want to die to kill my pride kill my L kill my ideas I want to be born again by the power of the Holy Ghost it is now our day it is our time a prophet was promised to come with a message to the bride has he come he has come and gone so this would be a Rapture message we have received it those who would receive it will not be scoffers they will become living a we are the people in the last days that are not going to be scoffers but there are others who will scoff at what give me 15 more minutes or so book ofans 1:9 the Bible says the thing has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done there is no new thing under the Sun so now if we're talking about the end the end is again coming we had the end but there was a time when there was a end days of Noah that was an end but we are at another end let us talk about the days of no in the message hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God don't just he recognize it don't just recognize it act upon [Music] it now see it has to be quickened to you I couldn't imagine Noah saying you know what it just must be rain someday so I would just go out and build me an ark if it rains well get in the and move right away and nothing will bother me because I'm going to get in the AR could you imagine no speaking like that no that wasn't it may the elected hear it now if that would have been it the first scoffer come by if Noah had done that the first cers would have come back as the Bible said there were they SC at him he would have laid his armor down and walked away are you hearing me no he wasn't doing this wish worship he was sure about what he was doing he was sure what he had he was convinced he was concerned I have to get this act done because is the promise of God God will not be slack concerning his promise if he said is going to rain it's going to rain and I tell you in our day we have said fire is coming down and that is going to happen if you don't like what I'm saying take it up with God that's what he's saying I'm just saying what he say like men does today that starts out with Jesus when they look over and see the truth they back away from it they can't stand it like that noted evangelist said I it will tear up my Ministry one brother told me actually that one of the prominent Pentecostal preachers here in the country one say this message is the truth but if I preach it I won't have a Ministry meaning people will not come these people are not after Souls they are after money they are after Their Kingdoms friends we didn't start the preaching vocation because of money you see if God wants me to be a poor man all my life I'm satisfied if he wants to me to make if you wants to make me the richest that I'll be satisfied it's all up to him I live for him I don't leave for myself I don't even leave for my children my wife I live for him you should live for him everything else you have is because of him you see that's the difference and this man came up and he said this will tear up my Ministry I don't care for a Ministry that the Holy Ghost would tear up that I don't care for a Ministry that the Holy Ghost would tear up yes because this word is the Holy Ghost word so if you fear to preach it say because I'm going to preach against women wearing trousers I won't preach it because women will live brother sister no no no no sisters if you want to live live those sisters who believe it they will stay we don't let me give me more sound we don't believe in women wearing trousers it is a spirit of Jezebel yes come on no it is the wordy 22 a woman will not wear that which pertains to a man or man will not wear that neither a man a woman parhas go back and read it you find out that there isas a woman is gar and a man is gar and it is different and a trouser is a man's garment that is why even when you go in the public toilet even if you're a woman wearing a trouser you are conscious will tell you that is a man don't go there but the devil has attacked the women of Our Generation and he has blinded them and has burned their conscience that even their conscious can't teach you see that's why you have women taking over pulpits women preaching and teaching and because pastor's wife or pastor's daughter then you are a preacher where you may have a gift to preach if you have it sister come on in we shall ask you to preach to our Sunday school oh yes that is all right but as far as the Bible is concerned a woman should not be a teacher oring authority over men but she can teach and as well as she the older women can teach younger women it is in the book of Titus what will the older women teach they will teach younger women how to love their husbands how to be amen keepers at home older sisters teach these younger sisters how to be real mothers how to keep at home not to go here and there the Bible says it is not me to preach it even the older women to preach theer sister how to love their children which means even women need to be taught how to love their children the way of the word so sister young sister when you begin calling your children and the older mother comes to you and says don't you ever use that language don't be offended the Bible tells us to do that to teach your younger sister how to love your children how to obey your husband how a keep at it is the word of God if you don't like it it's not up to me what do we have we have a generation of people who don't like to hear those things it will tear my Ministry any Ministry that all that will be teared by the Holy Ghost it ought to be teared it ought to be tear but see it is pride so much man so much person Noah was out in the field and he heard and he recognized and he acted no matter how many scoffers come he buil right away oh praise God so we here at dvf know what we are doing if I have 10 people in the church I'll preach like I have 1,000 if I have 100 I'll preach like I have 10,000 we will keep building and those who amen have revelation will keep building with us because we know this is not about man this is not the kingdom of T this is about the kingdom of God we are going on to the Rapture praise God that's why we don't have make our sign post and we put picture of Pastor his wife who likeor and M thank God for the end message thank God for the end message don't you feel so free don't you feel so liberated h hallelujah it's all about God it's not about man oh my I'm sure demons are hanging right now let them go to hell we shall preach this message hallelujah hallelujah the devil doesn't like it but we love it oh come on give me your amen we love it what is it it is the Holy Ghost and Fire it is keeping me alive it is keeping me what is it is the joy of Pentecost Glory Glory Glory Noah was out in the field and he heard and he recognized and he acted upon the no matter how many scers come he bu right away someone came Noah you are it doesn't bother me a bit buing right away he had he had recognized it to be God he judged it by the scripture and it was he built right away on the ark regardless the waters came down the waters came down and you needed to watch those people that time around the AR [Music] ofah remember last time I help you I bought remember no was just up there is that Joy of Pentecost keeping me alive is keeping me no how could you be proud like I will not waste time in explaining to them they can't understand oh my brother they all drown they all die oh that day is coming that day is coming again it's not going to be water God SW he will not the word with water again let me remind you something here he never gave a convenant that he want with fire he only said I won't kill the world again with water but that doesn't mean he doesn't have fire fire is coming down and he will kill the world with fire oh those that are amen wish worship are with scers amen those who are fornicators the imoral living the fearful the Abominable they will be burnt with fire and brimstone but where will the bride will be she will fly away she will fly away you will fly away you will fly away you will fly away oh my I feel drunk right now hallelujah hallelujah because we are going to fly away hallelujah praise God come on you have a right to praise God don't be so cold and look warm glory to God if the devil has been tempting you don't worry just praise the Lord Just Praise the Lord amen is my now amen did you know when you praising God Victory comes down the anointing of Victory comes down upon you Hallelujah that's why we should always praise God when we hear the word we say amen hallelujah the scers they SC the unbel they SC the believer we said no maker no trousers no forication no IM living no women pastors what do they do they SC at us we believe in holiness what do they do us noties what do they do no flatting with women or with men oh brother sister never tell any girl or woman that I love you if you're not going to marry them if you do it you have to repent to put your life right with God right unless they your daughter or your father or your husband is that right no flatting when we say no flatting they begin scoffing at us where the real genuine believer will not be bothered we will not be bothered let them SC there the Bible says there shall be scoffers in the last days let them SC we know where we are standing we know what we believe let them SC come on say it let them SC amen hallelujah amen praise God now I would have finished but give me a few moments let me talk about job and then we'll all right we are not preaching to light to evening light so I can take a few more moments here job 21 but job answered and said she had diligently my speech and let this be your consolations suffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken mock on SC on as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my speed be troubled job knew what he believed he was a real believer he did everything he had to do he gave sacrifices and lived right before God as a matter of fact in Job 1 it says there was a man in the land of woods whose name was job and that man was perfect upright feared God exed evil can the same testimony be given about the friends of job continue to Mo and but job had a testimony of the promise of God and his testimony was this I know my redeemer living and they shall stand at the day day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this [Music] body whom I shall see for myself and my eyes shall be hold and not another though my rigns be consumed within me believed in the superatural job knew he was going to be healed job had received the Revelation he was going to see God he had receiv received the Revelation even of the Rapture the Lord is not slack concerning his if you a sick in your body I want you to believe as long as you're living right take sin all sin away from it and live right with God and be desperate like that woman touched him she was desperate everybody that was desperate received what they needed you can't say you believe but maybe maybe maybe not maybe desperate go in prayer and say Lord this is what I want you to do for yes we believe in medication and but we also believe in a God who is our healer and he's not slack concerning all his promises but there is this one promise he has made for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with with the voice of the AR and the Trump of God and the dead Christ rise then we which are alive and remain shall be C up together with them in the CL Hallelujah I believe that to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord where for Comfort one another with those words praise God hallelujah hallelujah let me read this last quad from sadan church h he says I will come as a thief in the night ancient sadis was constantly harassed by Bandits that swooped down from the hills and piled the people that they knew only too well what the spirit was saying in that coming of the Lord is as [Music] a vigilance preparation alone will suffice to be ready for his coming if you live in a city please listen listen I'm finishing with this quote listen if you live in a city or in a town where you are always plagued with plagued with thieves always Vigilant and you prepare that is enough to be ready for his coming now we know that this is a message for the false Vine for the coming of the Lord will be as it was in the days of no in other words to the false he will come to them as a thief because they are not Vigilant and they are not prepared because they don't know but you have received a message of preparation to make you vigilant for his the eight sa were all aware of the impending flag and being aware we prepared and but the world of the ungodly was though they daily were in contact with the righteous and had the truth many will hear from you telling them the truth by the way that is why you should always testify about the truth you have please please please always testify brother Marvin find raise up your hand this brother will always give you tracks if you need them give your friends to tell them about the truth he said that these people were always with them they turned it aside it was too late don't turn it aside those completely can people in that ancient period type are today the nominal Christians they type out of the nominal Christians today whose lives are full of ath and take pleasure in them to such an extent that they have no desire for the spiritual they're not all aware of for his appearing it's so sad brother be ready for his coming let us stand Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus
