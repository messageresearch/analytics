[41:03] 2 verses
[41:06] 18. now
[41:15] so I'm reading in English
[41:18] when Jesus came into the course of
[41:21] kaiseria Philippi he asked his disciples
[41:23] saying
[41:25] whom do men say that I the son of man
[41:27] arm and they said some say that thou
[41:29] adjoin the Baptist some Elias and others
[41:33] Jeremiah's or one of the prophets he
[41:35] said unto them but whom say ye that I am
[41:37] and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[41:40] art at the Christ the son of the Living
[41:43] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[41:45] blessed blessed at thou Simon by Jonah
[41:48] for flesh and blood has not revealed eat
[41:51] unto thee but my Father which is in
[41:53] heaven and I say unto thee that are Thou
[41:55] Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will be
[41:58] with my church and the Gates of Hell
[41:59] shall not Prevail against it is
[42:22] foreign
[42:29] [Music]
[43:00] I want to thank God for uh brother Peter
[43:04] who has song Ready for the first time
[43:10] but that was nice
[43:15] amen as you continue to humble yourself
[43:18] and heal yourself I'm sure that God will
[43:20] use
[43:24] amen we need to pray that God will keep
[43:26] lifting up others
[43:32] amen want more more give each of us want
[43:35] wants to be a gift in the body
[43:38] you know
[43:42] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[43:46] that's what I'm speaking about the Gates
[43:48] of Hell shall not prevailing
[43:52] jeans no interpret what I'm saying the
[43:56] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[44:00] yes that's what I'm speaking about this
[44:03] praise God the guests over here
[44:10] [Music]
[44:23] you know especially when I look at
[44:25] myself many times
[44:27] and really for a long time ever since I
[44:30] got to know Jesus Christ as my personal
[44:31] savior
[44:34] you got to see how much the devil fights
[44:37] [Music]
[44:38] many forms
[44:40] in my own personal life
[44:43] and how many times
[44:46] the Lord has prevailed
[44:50] then I'm able to understand that it's
[44:52] not my fight I want Integrity it is
[45:00] this I thought I I shared I shared with
[45:03] you here some time back actually
[45:07] shall accomplish
[45:11] and I shared that also in a fear it was
[45:13] a blessing to the Saints there
[45:16] you know just the thought of knowing
[45:19] that when uh when when when God speaks
[45:22] his words
[45:25] his word shall not return unto him voice
[45:31] if his word goes out
[45:34] after it has gone out
[45:37] to must accomplish the purpose has been
[45:39] sent to us
[45:42] the word of man is not that way
[45:46] many times we give promises and break
[45:49] promises
[45:51] not because we did not want to
[45:54] accomplish the promises
[45:56] but because we are human
[45:59] many times times even when it comes to
[46:02] uh you know people
[46:05] you know disappoint one another
[46:08] way not because they wanted to
[46:10] disappoint one another
[46:12] but because they are human and they are
[46:15] not filled with the Holy Ghost most
[46:16] times
[46:17] [Music]
[46:18] you remember I always see this character
[46:21] Peter
[46:24] um Peter was a very good brother
[46:27] he was one of the spiritual brothers
[46:32] and one day he told Jesus yes look at
[46:36] all this one they may leave you
[46:39] but I will stay with us
[46:44] in other words
[46:49] they can all forsake you
[46:52] um
[46:54] those were the words of a man who
[46:57] actually meant to them
[47:21] [Music]
[47:41] [Music]
[47:45] I told you
[48:13] [Music]
[48:15] but then later on
[48:19] when they had captured Jesus I believe
[48:22] Peter was among those that was he the
[48:24] one who cut off that man's ears
[48:28] because he really was he meant what he
[48:31] said
[48:32] and then when they captured Jesus
[48:36] was among the ones that were shocked
[48:39] that they could actually capture
[48:42] I believe all the disciples thought that
[48:45] Jesus was Untouchables
[48:48] they could not take him they could not
[48:51] arrest him
[48:53] arrested him it was a surprise
[48:57] it was a big surprise to the fraternity
[49:00] of the believer
[49:02] they have arrested the Messiah
[49:06] imagine if you were the one at that time
[49:08] how would you what would you think
[49:11] they have called Jesus our leader yes
[49:15] they actually handcuffed him
[49:19] Mutual
[49:21] and so the disciples scattered
[49:24] including Peter
[49:28] intended to still keep his promise
[49:36] and so he was still around
[49:40] mm-hmm and as they took Jesus everywhere
[49:48] but in a distance
[49:59] [Music]
[50:08] but for me I'm here he's a Wendy but not
[50:10] a master sincerely realistically just to
[50:14] be in a distance
[50:17] because I don't want to be arrested
[50:33] foreign
[51:43] how can you
[52:16] [Music]
[52:34] [Music]
[52:43] I said feed myself
[52:45] and everything he prophesied
[52:48] you remember the first time he looked at
[52:50] him and he said
[52:57] he discerned him
[52:59] nobody had told Jesus Peter's name
[53:03] but it was by discernment he called him
[53:07] out by name
[53:09] and I want to say by this word Jesus has
[53:12] called you out of the World by name
[53:20] amen you received the revelation of the
[53:22] world
[53:23] upon that Revelation heal the church you
[53:27] are built there
[53:29] and the words of Hell cannot defeated
[53:36] went through a lot of sufferings
[53:55] [Music]
[54:01] amen we see here in the Book of Matthew
[54:03] chapter 16.
[54:05] and Jesus came into the course of
[54:08] kaiseria Philippines
[54:10] and he asked the disciples whom do men
[54:13] say that I the son of man
[54:17] and they said some say you were John the
[54:26] Baptists
[54:29] what about you what do you say
[54:34] and now Simon Peter Simone he answered
[54:38] and he said
[54:39] you are Christ great Christian foreign
[54:50] [Music]
[54:52] what is the son of a rabbit oh man I
[54:54] welcome you average
[54:58] the son of a donkey um
[55:02] to say that Jesus was the son of God
[55:06] God is a spirit
[55:08] John 4 24 God is a spirit
[55:12] and Peter said you are the
[55:16] Christo not a Christ see a river
[55:20] Christian
[56:19] the son of the living foreign
[57:03] equipment
[57:04] and Upon This Rock
[57:07] I will build my children
[57:11] flesh and blood has not revealed it is
[57:22] Jesus
[57:25] who what's the revelation of who Jesus
[57:27] is
[57:29] that Jesus Christ is
[57:34] and upon this Revelation
[57:37] I will build my church
[57:39] the Catholic church say that the the the
[57:42] Revelation that The Rock was Peter
[57:48] and and you know the the Anglican Church
[57:51] say that The Rock was Jesus
[57:54] but you see we've received the
[57:56] Revelation in our days
[58:03] hallelujah the church is built upon that
[58:06] rock
[58:07] the church is built upon that Revelation
[58:10] he says
[58:11] because of that and before I continue I
[58:16] want to say that church
[58:18] was built from the First Ages
[58:22] the second the third video we are right
[58:26] here on the last time
[58:28] the Church of Jesus Christ
[58:47] that is why I don't care what the name
[58:49] of the church is
[58:51] the center of their teachings is not the
[58:54] revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:56] [Music]
[58:58] it is
[59:07] or if it is
[59:15] not the original chance
[59:23] of Jesus Christ
[59:26] the name of the Lord
[59:29] and that church you can track it from
[59:31] the very beginning
[59:33] at the very beginning
[59:49] they have not been a big group
[59:53] every generation
[59:55] they've been a small group
[1:00:01] talking about from the days of the
[1:00:03] Apostles
[1:00:04] they were just around like rats
[1:00:10] trying to find where they will hide
[1:00:13] Quaker it appeared as if what they had
[1:00:17] was strange
[1:00:19] and what was their greatest enemy
[1:00:23] the religious people
[1:00:25] and what did they hate most

[1:00:36] name of Jesus they did not want them to
[1:00:38] preach in the name of Jesus the church
[1:00:41] in the original in the first church
[1:00:44] their Foundation was the revelation of
[1:00:47] who Jesus is
[1:00:51] Jesus was not just a man
[1:00:55] knew that Jesus was God in France
[1:00:59] it is very easy for us to believe
[1:01:02] but it's very difficult for them
[1:01:07] foreign
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:27] they saw everything
[1:01:30] when he went to the temple and the
[1:01:34] priest would say take the children away
[1:01:37] he was Among Us
[1:01:40] when he became 12 years
[1:01:42] he started now you know challenging the
[1:01:45] priests
[1:01:47] and they were amazed at his wisdom
[1:01:52] and his parents
[1:02:03] me and your father
[1:02:06] that was the narrative at that time
[1:02:10] that was the narrative at that time in
[1:02:13] that generation
[1:02:16] that Joseph was the father of Jesus
[1:02:20] by Mary saying that me and your father
[1:02:23] have been looking for you he denied the
[1:02:25] Virgin birth
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:26] foreign
[1:03:53] because he has some little
[1:04:28] he was a threat even to the Jews
[1:04:31] themselves
[1:04:33] because the Jews they knew the
[1:04:36] prophecies
[1:04:41] he is the one coming to to uh to Deliver
[1:04:45] Us from the hands of the Romans
[1:04:48] and then it turned out that he wasn't he
[1:04:51] said my kingdom is
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:17] [Music]

[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:55] foreign
[1:07:16] do you personally have a revelation
[1:07:19] of this Jesus we are talking about
[1:07:25] and they all kept
[1:07:28] quieter while he was there yeah foreign
[1:07:58] foreign
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:09:35] was built upon the revelation
[1:09:54] you know
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] yes
[1:10:13] it's the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:28] and that's why the world hurts you yes
[1:10:32] whatever it is
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:03] the one that puts Sweetness in the world
[1:11:06] oh yeah
[1:11:08] the one loves you oh yeah yeah because
[1:11:11] the word loves you because you are like

[1:11:16] you are like Christ never finding like
[1:11:19] this Jesus is in you yes the world will
[1:11:21] automatically hate it
[1:11:25] and the disciples
[1:11:31] why why because of Jesus but the church
[1:11:36] we have today is
[1:11:38] Love
[1:11:40] by the way
[1:11:44] because the world has come into the
[1:11:46] church
[1:11:50] that's right
[1:11:52] how many believe that
[1:11:58] the preachers no longer have a backbone
[1:12:02] to say the truth
[1:12:05] the worship leaders
[1:12:07] they just do entertainment instead of
[1:12:09] worship Brothers
[1:12:12] they have teams called teams of dancers
[1:12:16] and you know they copy the stairs of the
[1:12:19] world
[1:12:20] and they bring it in the church
[1:12:23] for what purpose to attract the younger
[1:12:26] generation
[1:12:28] if the gospel we are preaching
[1:12:33] that it cannot attract the younger
[1:12:36] generation
[1:12:38] which is not worth it
[1:12:44] but they have to devise other things
[1:12:50] you find the gods and boys
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:04] and they are saying they're doing it for
[1:13:06] Jesus
[1:13:07] that is not the Jesus of the Bible yes
[1:13:10] the Jesus of the Bible has another way
[1:13:15] of attracting people to himself
[1:13:19] that is according to the Bible friends
[1:13:34] those are the things that attracted the
[1:13:37] people
[1:13:39] come and see
[1:13:41] what is this all about
[1:13:44] Gucci
[1:13:45] but the world hated the decisions
[1:13:48] because of this name Jesus yes whenever
[1:13:51] they spot Jesus
