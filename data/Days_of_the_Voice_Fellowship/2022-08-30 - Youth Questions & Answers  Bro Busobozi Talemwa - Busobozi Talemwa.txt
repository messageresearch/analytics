========================================

is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i know [Music] one day [Music] i know it was [Music] praise the lord you may have your seats for now so i want to greet you all in the name of jesus once again america modi day was scooped by mrs arinda a fumbidum charla linda mrs uh i excused myself a little bit i want to pick my uh wife and baby hospital and you know when you walk into a hospital with your wife in bad pains and then you come out with a baby and ha it is the grace of god no flu no moana um we will go to business right away because of time again again good day god bless you church i have a burning testimony of where is good church but gave birth to jesse the father of david i was wrong that was not rahab it was rude is that not so you see my children you know sometimes when preachers when we are preaching some sometimes you can give a wrong quote and speak a wrong name and place things wrongly but i believe each person who is spiritual they are able to read between the lines to me praise the name of the lord so it is the person who wrote this thank you for your correction um actually it was ruth that if you go to the book of ruth mitchell you'll notice in chapter four verse 21. salmon begat boys okay so now i have a question here the nature of the i know he says can i pay my time by helping the needy praise the lord i don't have a name according yeah to the person that uh asked this question but i want to say no you cannot know we as believers should help the need i should help the orphans and the widows i will give more details in the little videos i told you that i would be able to get along but if you go to malachi chapter 3 are you there what you say yo malacca is the last book in the old testament says [Music] and he says in taipei's an offering baby where are you and then he says here cast with the cast for ye have robbed me even this whole nation naga mama called me that if i will not open your you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it according to this verse he says bring all your tithes where are you supposed to bring it where why store house what is kept in the storehouse food meri not so super chilly so food is kept in the store cutting in this case so the word is the one that you receive from goddess storehouse whenever you come to church and you hear the word you are receiving food from the stores so then and now after receiving that food and medicine you are required as a believer to now pay your time so about two two things i'll talk about what are you interviewing you know i will not go into the details of tagging i'll give the details on the videos but for now i just want to and if you have another question out of this uh what i would say you again send it to me i will still address it on the video program you know but everyone receives income you see when you receive income maybe someone has given you a gift maybe you kept money on the bank and you accrued some interest and so this interest or whatever it is that you receive you give back to god as acknowledgement that the blessing has come from him i spoke i think about uh a few weeks ago i spoke on taithes and offerings the person that has asked this please go and listen to that now your tithe you pay your tithers to your church you see god had um levites in the old testament and these levites were men that did not get any inheritance god said don't do not worry you you you are mine and so you see your tribe the tribe of levi you you are mine and all the other tribes they were given inheritance other 10 to the high priest and of course the high priest now was standing in also for the lord to the levites and to the people of the delivered to in for the lord in other words we do not give our tithes to people it so when you for instance if you pay your tithe to me you don't give it to me as a gift over to chimpanzee you give it to me as though you've given it unto the lord recognition that you're recognizing me as a as your pastor and someone that god has placed there for you are you spiritual so now if i take that type money cutting entire sentence and i use it the wrong way that's none of your business from the very beginning we have been giving accountability of your funds that's how we've used it to get requested but there is no obligation for any person to account to you how we use [Music] if you want the details on this subject please go and listen to the someone i preached on tithes and offerings it's on youtube and also on the podcast to an evangelist [Music] someone is preaching on the road and you're like oh you're preaching so well and then you take your title if you have something to give him give him away if you have something to give the need to give them away but if you pay it to your church praise the name of the lord and um i wish i could go in detail and read you a few quotes here okay okay so that's why it's good for you to write your name so whatever you do but still i'll i'll give more details okay now i have another question here from brother sam oregon how can a person control his or her feelings maybe when tempted or maybe not oh how can a person control i think they mean if how can a person control his or her feelings when tempted or not why is that i think they are asking how can you have self-control you see self-control is not a gift self-control you can only attain it if you have the holocaust if you don't have the holy spirit you cannot have self-confidence uh i'll ask you a question many times you can do what's wrong with you and then you you say well from today i will never do this again [Music] okay and you will overcome what no one would why because you do not have self-control but you see in your control tower [Music] now it is what is on your soul a children is what is controlling you if it's the devil satan is controlling you if it's god is controlling now what is in your soul of us we are born with a mad soul twas we are born in a perverted i'm speaking about the seed of god [Music] we you can pick that from genesis we have the seed of god truly and the seed of the sabbath the seed of the serpent no matter what you do never walk all right no matter how you preach to them no matter how powerful a preacher is but they will be like a duck when it rains it will suck and soak in water and then after it finishes the rain just shake itself on it and then it will be dry again you see that is how it is very strong there are three stages of you of grace that god will take you through the way first thing you will do you will justify you when it justifies you [Music] will not [Music] people who are addicted to alcohol i ran to ramaniro you know they can say i will leave it because of some conviction so you will leave it for a while and after some time you go back again you leave it there is for the rest of your life but the only thing that changes you mentioned is what is on your control tower as you stay under the altar but it was hearing the word baptism after baptism nobody what would you say god working on you the word every time you say that coming to fellowship and hearing the word listen to the word hallelujah how does faith come to receive the holy ghost you only need to have faith [Music] so we continue living between desires we live questions would you be tempted oh yes but you can control it it's not you it is christ in europe the problem the reason why it is so hard for young people to live a christian life that's because they are trying to do it themselves you cannot do it by yourself you can't overcome anything by yourself the only thing you have to do is to yield to you where will you receive the holy ghost from that moment hallelujah he's on the control tower the one guiding you and leading you yeah when you are tempted never he's your strength and he gives you victory in every temptation hallelujah the answer to this the only way you can control receive the holy ghost praise the name of the lord and then and then one person asked for one person talked about the banner again said how have you been um how are you yeah i've been fine since i got saved and i was filled with the holocaust not just my mom took i've been you know fighting with two dogs in me the black [Music] adult naga my worry same when zeruko it will overcome the white house but if you feed the white one neighborhood it will defeat the black people so if you feed on the world category and prayer no server you receive strength of a man to overcome the flesh but if you are listening to what let me use whatever it is i'm going toward the parties all your friends are not then [Music] [Music] foreign please the question is drugs is it bad to use drugs in the case it is for a good reason so my question so now anything drugs we have a doctor here a medical doctor when a truly name is i believe if any drug was prescribed to you or for you in the hospital it is not bad to use it most of the drugs many of the drugs we use in the hospital you know actually most of them are gonna really come from herbs nancy's that's true doctor peter what's your chili so who made weed katyani according to god made with casual korean jagger right chili is that true god made with cattle but what happens to people the devil montgomery didn't know where again there is that but it is the devil satani that perverts what god has created is it satanic and evil have sex young people you how can something be holy in one context and be evil in another chin because it did not or was not done according to the rules [Music] so now when you ask me is it bad to use drugs in case it's for a good reason if the first question i'll ask is what type of drug cambodia that are going to charge if it's medical drugs if it's for medical reasons then i don't even think it's a question because it's prescribed by a doctor and it's going to be in limits whereby it will not become addictive but if you are going to take a drug like weed for example or something like that already and someone has convinced you that you see this when you take it you will no please answer me you're honest with yourself don't go deep into the thing just understand my yes it's a good reason so the person asked the scripture says that we should not um we should not fashion ourselves after the world a challenge if it's not a healthy reason to simultaneously if it's a healthy reason then the doctor will have to prescribe them but if it's not a healthy reason oh yeah there's a healthy reason i don't believe you should go and begin taking with securities according to your own prescription cutting gorgeous saliva until january that is not right because it's going to end up in um in getting addicted to the drug and sometimes you're going to be really low oh don't know what to everyone say don't take it take i don't know it's mixed with his blood or something yeah two guys say that he got the name so the doctor told him you should never leave it because if you leave it you will die now if that uncle was a member of my child i would pray for them for them to leave it and be alive so the doctor can as well prescribe something that is not really good for you as a christian a christian must have a spiritual thinking filter um i'm not sure i'm not a medical person but i think it has a lot of weed in it or something some of those elements and it's very addictive so um as a believer if you're taking something like that but when you achieve towards you even by the fact that you are taking it no comments it shows that you are not believing that god can heal you why would you take something with such a side effect and then you're like oh no it's okay as long as the doctor is prescribed it's the devil that perverts what god has made is what god has made to make it look like [Music] parents of evil it may not appear to be evil it may not be evil but as once [Music] how many understand that but still get this so i believe it's um not right for believers to take drugs if i was the one and i was prescribed to take weeds to get out of a problem i would have to put food to our test i would say god if you do not heal me i'm pregnant but if i take weed when you and you're going to get out of my problem then you would have to prove to me whether you are living i don't know how many would do that i believe our god is not so little that you would have to stoop so low um in order to go according to the systems of the world so brother i believe when you said drugs i meant believe you said weed because what we they talked about and those uh the name foreign what can i do when in school and people are praying the rosary while kneeling am i supposed to kneel like them um i would say congratulations you cannot worship idols to be politically correct [Music] you cannot as a child of god women don't have your own standards you can do anything but you cannot bow before idols if they let them kneel all the people praise the name of the lord you cannot knew before i don't have amelia you cannot kneel before the gods of rome if it's in your home you have to respectfully make it clear orinochito [Music] where i come from geneva most of my family members are not believers so if they invite me peter they make sure there is no alcohol if anything stands between me and god shall never see me i take god as my prayer is number one in my life everything else is [Music] god bless you church i'm about mexican sir i have a lot of because i want to read for each question but i'm just going to go through as much as i can and and then now i will go through each of them with them you know whatever you can understand [Music] i don't understand the question why it's people oh this this one needed to have some more grammar why it's people company about the believers to stay with unbelievers they understand the question why people why is it people company about the believers why is it that people complain about the believers is that the question about it's easy to stay with unbelievers why did the world act reject why the world believers is it good when you marry an unbeliever before getting this message of the hour okay now maybe you're asking why do the the what does the word reject believers russians it is simple christ was rejected so they will reject us one thing about the world and see you engage if you do what they want you are their friends no other thing to say you see you cannot if everybody is going to academy for example if everybody is going for a disco i mean and they are going to go down ok ok and they are and you are also going with them now do you think you are going to dress as you dress when you are coming to church and go with them but for you to fit in them you would have to dress like them or you know you would have to dress a trouser oh yeah or a meniscus if you're a young man you would have you would have to um you know these days even younger men are using makeup they are putting pins in their ears you must have to stress what the world but if you stand on your ground as a child of god rejects the devils and the demons in the world again satan the name is the demons in the world let me imagine fear [Music] the most curses being influenced hallelujah how can if you are not a cockroach well that will change how can you accompany with cockroaches oh he's not your beta navy angel is it possible to love darkness [Music] they hate lights and then you find yourself with them i'm changing them your friend that you love so much sure he loves you so much let them hear the word and change you okay that therefore in them has to die or you're standing i'm really mad you know but if it cannot food then there is a problem sorry if you continue to accompany with them and then is it good when you marry an unbeliever before getting the message of the hour i think the question should be now if you divorce one it will become his wife i hope the brother will say that amen doesn't want to matter too [Music] and so god puts that under the blood of her baby whatever you did in the past god does not remember that in in the in the years when you did not know the truth and so there are some scars [Music] for instance if a girl believes the message um and she hears what i preach in the morning that she has to be a virtuous woman to repent my husband before marriage is for not to be no queen and yes and oh what can i do now got incorrect yeah i was i did not know that noticed without knowing now because but now i've believed that the indicator is there the scout will remain it can cover it just signal because you have repented away do not make you a virgin [Music] if someone was you know moving around in the world and they get hiv and they believe this can remain in couples can god heal them oh yes we have testimonies of people that god has healed jesus on principle i'm saying this when someone has several wives and believes that scar will remain with them they will remain with the wives but it's a scar in their lives and they can't be beacons are they in koni they can't be passed why because of that in their life says neighborhood and you had a girlfriend you repent of that and leave them ah that's right i mean only one person [Music] want to give you all those words and you know it's there oh yeah yeah yeah this is a new one yes yes maybe you can to be your future wife that's really in the hands of the lord amen oh my so i'm watching the time i want to stop at six and it's fine uh this is i think a young sister come on okay so under what circumstances can i believe and marry an unbeliever attacker brother why are you trying to change the word you see the prophet says brother you have to give me more sounds let me say again some people are not being attentive you because she doesn't believe like you do [Music] not foreign this is a good one of corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers up praise the lord come here be ye not equally yoked together with unbelievers [Music] [Music] rich [Music] i would rather why can't you preach to them let god convert them again and then wait if they are really converted [Music] in many circumstances they do not have an idea to marry them when they were preaching to them [Music] maybe one of them may be your wife when he went after one month he had read it he realized it was the truth he came back now come out and he told he was around for some time not serious but he was around and this brother organ is now a preacher of the message and he's married to this sister yeah what's up and they have about i think three children now no zakatibadi mobile now and they are both having gone they never never went to zacato under so sister did not do pcm [Music] there is no circumstance my brother why do you want better yet with examples no this is another question with examples from the bible what punishment has god ever given to a church or a pastor or a prophet who misuses all mismanages the tithe and offerings of the church musumba go to what everywhere where are you go to what they've you know who misuses all mismanagers the tithe and offering for the church now i believe my brother and i have your name here but i'll not mention it and you really have guts to put your name on on such questions you see i believe you've got to ask that because you found that we are mismanaging funds here uh servants of god who mismanaged the fact that [Music] and as know executed one and when he gives his word well you'll get a chicken but it holds you accountable he holds you accountable now some people think what um that's pastors who preach this message and the people will not be judged but i tell you what every money you receive for descendants of foreign and we shall give accountability now those of you in my family know me very well i believe in accountability ask for budgets but i believe all the members of my family have come to learn and appreciate it is there a member of the family you must learn accountability [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the name of the lord some of these questions i'll spend some good time on them and give more prescriptions brother used to say the statement read between the lines what does it mean now that means that not everything he says is the way he says it is saint if you're never if we speak on on if i can preach on the serpent seed without mentioning the act that was done but then again you have to read between the lines now you got to go you're not taking [Music] many times i've been preaching and i said the scripture says then we go back again to genesis how many have read between the lines so according to you what did you do did you read between the lines and what did you see kawaii who else has another answer yes okay yes amen again [Music] yes sometimes if you visit somebody reading between the lines teach your name all right brother you're married you are married one day visit brother wanga's home rumor since you didn't understand i have to explain to you now and when i visited your home his wife gave me juice a glass of dries very nice and so i noticed brother ruanga turned to his wife the way he looked at her [Music] [Music] do you know what it means how many know what that means yes yes so you've been in a situation where you are in a place to be actually in your mind be removing the words that you now our mind and those are yours not sleep our spirit homeopathy is our mind oh you've got faith in those are your faith and some people dream other stones the subconscious and the consciousness and each of us have those one of them i know that i know in my life is my wife you can be there talking and then in a moment she explains to you what you will see now in her subconscious which take it now that's the same thing a vision is the same thing that happens when you are dreaming that here your conscious has to go to sleep and you already want mechanisms worshiping never sins they see things which come to pass others you know there are many different things that we see in our subconscious and others don't really dream there is something here that the bible says what do i achieve on a bible check i want to read it quickly for you in the book of uh 12 romans 12. and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god is [Music] and the only thing that can renew our mind is the word our mind begins to think on the things of god cutting then the words that you know what's that means to show you what i'm saying and how it is connected to dreams is um put music take a call or a nimba and go to bed way back when you sleep welcome you will begin to dream those things as if you were actually it is actually in real reality um your mind root of yamun is god communicating to me it's just to show you the same thing says when you die you don't you remain the change same person that was it to you so now if you were a roper or a thief when you die and walk out of this body oh nobody will be good you're not going to become a good man don't get the out tomorrow remain at fifa rover and he will go to hell as a thief and even your mind in hell will be a seat until you come before the white something [Music] [Music] [Music] in your life and wash your consciousness the moment you receive the holy ghost you hear the word of god [Music] did they nowhere get up and when you eat too much you dream things and in an emergency of dreams then there's also a lot of um a lot of discrepancies okay but until someone's conscious is washed and cleansed by the word of god and their mind renewed or katya i'm not gonna go call a baby into every night yeah he says when he the holocaust comes he will do what he's called show you things together gave him to every kingdom i believe he can do that in dreams so these dreams are only showing you the status of your spiritual life now embedded time that these dreams have changed praise the lord come here my question is about marriage and you don't have a name as far as seeking god's kingdom and his righteousness first are concerned his marriage also god is righteousness there are many things that married people do what would have been to know india but from baby baby that are not expected of them to do this why right it's because they need to overcome them will you overcome them i need a special relationship with god so i believe before you get married when you don't have a head coach you don't come to church you don't pay your tithe no you're not a serious christian tell him i just uh you know up and down oh yeah i was doing what you were unstable you come when you want you can pray and now how would you have a a a a a a family and guide your wife be if you cannot receive a breakthrough in prayer now before you get married so you have to break through before you get married as a christian or message believer which is the correct way of marrying that god once you choose your own wife i know that there are some people who say they are the ones who tell you who to marry man say bring this brother yeah and bring this sister oh no sister and say you too you can now talk about him yeah look at this again we see you are fit for one another but that is i was going to tell you a story but [Music] they think they uh they they are physically mature i don't want the normal video and their body is saying you must marry me so they talk to a guy the you have no business doing that you see for sure you must be open listen believers don't take it [Music] there is a difference between dating and courtship call your own or you know kubernetes for waiting and hear me you must have an income too don't marry someone's daughter and tell them who told you about you don't worry sisters [Music] [Music] everywhere [Music] [Music] um also i will no canoed a man so don't after everything has been done now you're not told me sisters are coming you're coming to church in a youth meeting like this hallelujah amen opening your eyes does not mean lasting africa for a younger lady some of you don't get worse because you're looking for the wrong thing you are looking for the character of christ in a woman you know what to look for in balancing does she does she have sacredness around her yeah as a woman [Music] because i don't want to dress a woman who will dress like this and then attract other men i want to marry someone who dresses like a believer if you see a boy a girl with all the americans and everything and yeah i don't know the meaning is just not that man is not also saved yes never god said god and saved himself he's just lying to us you show who you are by what you married you see then then so you begin looking out for christians if she's beautiful praise god how can i hear myself but if she's not oh that's simulanji that's okay as long as the character sometimes some people marry some people and they they begin splashing them all over what's happened you youtube oh my queen oh my beauty and then when you look at right because many of the times if a young man came to me the next part i would tell them go ahead and talk to us you know if they have not yet spoken well that time now you'll get her you know i always find out when they come to me after speaking together out there usually it doesn't end where i have found that in minecraft [Music] who came to me one time no one can know who they are so and this has happened on several occasions and he spoke to me i'm interested in sisterhood [Music] [Music] but when the brother was talking with the sister sister was behaving as if she was singing and that's where the problem was so usually come to the pastor for cancer or can you help me can you talk to her on my behalf you know someone asked me to talk to him said brother if you cannot talk to it means you're not ready for marriage if they refuse you now just gather yourself up away and wait for another opportunity but if they are the right ones for you they can never and of course when you start talking then you go into courtship at some point the pastor gets to know him then uh you announce your engagement when agreements are met again and then ultimately that will end up into our wedding i think i've answered that question number three i need to know and to do the rightful way of attaining a sister [Music] because i wish to pursue one come on [Laughter] i i love this i wish to pursue one i will get there rather go and pursue naked i have heard that it is allowed for sisters to to do makeups it themselves on their weddings by wearing whatever they want and painting themselves is it true or false my wife never did that and we had a beautiful word and that's all i can say can you forgive someone who tries to fail your life pastor [Music] so uh yeah the bible tells us to forgive everybody together to certainly win but i need to understand they need to go together what circumstances that are surrounding this case i i don't know what to say i don't know what you're going through cementing my childhood please come and see me okay now there is another question here okay our time is up can i can i continue a little bit more how many say but i can just close now and we'll do this on video but if you want me to continue [Music] be okay how many said 30 minutes all right so let us continue for 30 minutes um this is another brother okay here's another question here the bible talks about a time for everything and it is said that when you jump a stage that child would and that you can be one to go back don't you think one needs to involve himself or herself in what she or he is supposed to do at the time don't you think you know you know how do we know that it is time for this and that to together you know but you know and he was quoting ecclesiastes chapter three verse one you ever done um i do not know on the on what perspective but it is true there is time for everything there are times whatever you say that and i regret that i can these days i've tried my best i'm still trying to find those times but it's becoming increasingly hard i would go in um a bush somewhere what would he say that when again and just get into those thickets there are many things that have come into my life that have made it increasingly hard for me to be the way i was then parked somewhere on the roadside and i entered into a bush they would be even they may bring the news people to investigate they may think that i'm going to maybe kill someone you understand what i'm saying there are things that you can do sometimes [Music] at some levels in your life you will notice that you do not have the opportunities you had then if i say i'm going away for several days my wife will say but we need you in gangnam hi the person asking this question she was a child he said something that that when you skip something it comes back again to you that one turns into another corner as if to say that if you don't play football now you'll play it when you get older something will come that you didn't i believe as a christian ticket is so i gave up and so i lost interest in the shower and i've never been a footballer i've never been a football fan i did some games but when i got saved i left why believers believers are not supposed to gamble gambling or is a sign and symbol of listeners when you go to america now america the god of america catholic america is a woman [Music] and we should even collect money like that they are doing it now but even then in america america they used to preach against the bible says we should not fashion ourselves after the world baby but it would not find a gangnam game so most of these things are really entertainment entertainment you do now you must make sure you know that you're not being overtaken praise the name of the lord remember and maybe i'll be giving more details on that and all the histories of some of these things we're there's some games and entertainment that is not not bad and i'm not saying that believers should not have any sort of entertainment but you must watch what type of entertainment do you engage in yourself right so i have another question here is ruth still here lucy why god loves people but he wants people to save really i'll need her to clarify to save him or to serve them i don't really understand i need ask okay i was asked this question by one of the my denominational friends i need clarification on this verse at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man and at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man [Music] [Music] [Music] study of this scripture i don't understand the context but the scripture that comes to my mind right now is that if there is somebody talking about requiring blood on your head someone who helped me remind me that scripture got yes that might as well be by itself verse 5 might mean something else i'll need to have a deeper set on that but now there is another scripture that i wanted to look at already okay i also don't see it quickly here but it says if you see someone doing wrong chicken [Music] their blood will be required upon your head so that's the scripture that is coming close to this but i need to study um i'll surely deal with this on the video the question was why god needs blood of human lives this is not interpret your interpretation of this verse the person he is asking the question was why does god need blood of human lives i do not believe that god is demanding for human life i remember one day i was preaching and i said god requires blood yet the only he sacrifices never asked for is human life of christ so i don't think that's the interpretation but i need to if you are it would have done me well who asked this question i never said she was a chin are you here for anyone okay so uh i will need your name can you put your name on take a kid i will need to be sure to send you the answer yeah all right so there's another question here no i don't believe they are lost okay i i will not just justice to this one again because i want to deal with them a little more but let's go a little over it okay and i love the questions you asked by the gideon they're quite deep as well says what did jesus mean when he said that why did what did jesus mean when he say that the last the last shall come fast and the first last [Music] another place in scripture where he speaks of those that we are fast and those that were lost but they all received the same reward result and speaking of this we can look at the church edges from the very first church [Music] but the question is he was a teacher would they receive the reward yes they will receive the right name but we which are alive father and remain we are the last one father to come in we are the 11th hour workers father because they are the last bride to enter my opinion we complete everything the full revelation of the word here's what the scripture says we shall not hinder them that are asleep yakuza and remain we shall be caught up to the equality one to meet with the lord together with them in the end so but i know there is another aspect of that question and i'll get to it uh later how about if you you vow to the girl friend it's just like the many vowels we make i want to tell you christ sets you free from all those vows that you put in there is that a man so if you vote organa gideon vows to my sister receiver coming from your village and for her to yeah her father he has a v and he is displeased the bible says he has a right i know you tell her you will not marry me now according to the bible bible she is set free from that because the father refused you understand which target now if the father physical father can do that how much more god i'll take her to one that is singing and they set you free from vowels that you made before you came to the knowledge of the truth are you going to remain with your ears because you had made a vow you were actually set free from faith amen pastor is it possible for a person filled with the holy ghost to get a demon in him just like somebody asking me children can you get possessing demons in you so if you think you have demons in you you don't have the holy ghost and you need to be delivered and receive the holy ghost right what if i like an unbeliever who is well corrected well and i sent another brother to preach to her cathy marco organized [Music] [Music] is the brother and for him to even be wise enough not to express it at all and preach to her now what do you think she believes and because they are already friends if you ever have feelings for a girl who isn't a believer because you are you are if you are alive and you are normal even if you have the holy ghost but you still have blood in your in your body moving a human being right so you will see and you will like oh yeah got it and i remember when i was in school there were nothing more submarines before and after i believed the message rather i was in a high school narrative i oh [Music] [Music] please do not do that do not mix it up attraction is a natural thing that happens but it is not at all connected to marriage let me tell you that attraction fades away with time so if you're attracted can you work sinners and then you marry her no about securitism it's only a sign of weakness as a man and a human being don't even think about marriage you can't be you can't think about marriage because you are attracted to people by the way you cannot even plan marriage because of a strong feeling of marriage that should attract you to that woman so there is no character in a woman who is not a believer like oh moment angry that's when you realize she has no character right and so is it brother says the man without the holy ghost is like a beast yeah you know the behaviors of children of god what about requires us to do this you know and when you begin to especially when you you can talk about trousers about women please please i'd like to be your friend you are gone you are gone oh wait get the brother says everything give it away you said she has when you know it because if you cannot witness to somebody well what a similar buddhism to because they are attracting you [Music] it means even the spirit you were in general your word is not the right spirit you are already overtaken and you need to come to the pastors am i preaching to someone otherwise if you love somebody and love them somewhere hallelujah you are going to really pray for them and you're going to preach to them not not have feelings for them praise the lord come here all right properly is it a must that a black should not marry a white chapter oh it was just an advice and behind here america one no he wrote something and he crossed it i mentioned about that one there's an extra time did the prophet advise us not and they changed his mind is it a mask so you already know what the prophet says what the prophet says hallelujah i mean i think i've answered that no other giant all right i i i i uh if you want my opinion i'll give you my opinion right i mean you because god doesn't like me god is not a mixer and he doesn't like mexican attack black and white and yes and then you give back to children who do not have descent and he calls them yes you know they are not white they are not black so when you you as a black man you give birth you don't give back to a white and you don't give back itself [Music] [Music] dream to my whites but that's the the spirit of our of our continent oh god all right so i think that answers that but on on those on on that uh i answered again by answering you that we have one race and that is at the christian race [Music] is [Music] oh and then you [Music] [Music] is [Music] if you love somebody but when i got home too or if you have met for the first time even if you have met for the first time you love them with the bad feelings you can feed them and then afterwards no more theopia there's a sister i don't wanna thank god i was with my wife nevertheless you know she we had preached to her she loved the message she accepted it so what went from here and she started to go there yeah it means you don't appreciate us in ethiopia ethiopia i said how come that you say that uh you connect this food with ethiopia i tell you to get such an ethiopia you should ethiopia it means you want to know what happened don't worry my wife was there and so she fed my wife my wife also named and i was there too in hungary it was really weird but after a few years i preached to the believers about culture oh the bible says that a woman should not put on anything oh i mean a cloth that is for a man does it mean that a woman cannot put on a man's jacket [Music] he's not saying husband wife or something or like me putting on my wife's car for something no no no or exchange formats of clothing [Music] [Music] if i was a woman and you know so really that is impossible for a woman to dress a trouser and she doesn't show the form out of her body of a woman it actually i'll not use the what i was going to use in the middle there but i would say it attracts naturally attracts the eyes of a man oh movie the bible [Music] the bible you'll take care of your christian even the old testament and that's why women should dress clothes that cover their bodies how long is wrong so so you see sometimes we say as long as it is below the knee to come back so i hope i've answered that if a sister wants to jog for health issues what should she wear i am not yet [Music] what should she wear just like saying if a sister is going for swimming what should she wear you are a christian when you're swimming you were a christian when you were jogging you were a christian in the everywhere you are [Music] how about if you vow to the girlfriend after believing the message what is the way forward i believe in the message what is the word for what would i answer this there was a chance i think i i answered this there are many vows that can be made one way all right let us read um this one i'm about to finish i'm just closing up i have about five papers i think i should just finish them right quickly how can one come to get a close connection with god because most of the youth try their best but in most cases things fail i personally i get challenges which i cannot be open to anyone so i'm kindly requesting for both advice and health [Music] okay now you get close to god through prayer through reading the word and um what does it take to be like you a messenger of god and you don't have to be a preacher if you're a god sing in church departments here there's a video department on my video this was you know music and everything here's the key interventions cleaning the church [Music] how does one prove that a specific pastor is a true prophet of god jesus said you would know them by their fruits yes which [Music] if worldly things are taking control of you how do you always fight [Music] and in a book courtship character and conduct the prophet says one should marry one whom she or he can't live without now question what if she or he is an unbeliever but when all his or her conduct and all characteristics show that he or she can believe can one hurry huh [Music] and all characteristics show that did [Music] oh and forever again you can make it well i understand that what marries one is the acceptance of a proposal for marriage [Music] under what circumstances does this proposal become null and void [Music] it can only become null and void in several circumstances if it's been announced by the parents that they believe is especially the father of the god if the vow was not made in good faith doesn't have a vow that you've made with anybody i want you to know when you make it all move it's not turning back so be careful with your vows don't bow if you're not ready to keep it you don't know is it adultery if a lady has something like like six children from different men whereby she's not married of to any of them of course she's an adulteress woman because banger she's lived with many men but they never said it's just like that woman who met jesus with the prostitute and she um she had she had had six five and then was living with the sixth yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] all right i have one more here oh it says the elect believers on their death food go to the 16th dimension and the non-believers are uh goes to the fifth dimension on the second resurrection [Music] no the ones who are separated like sheep from god who gets salvation opportunity thereafter judgment before this when their faith is not yet decided which dimension are they the sixth or the fifth i mean so the brother is asking i don't know if all of you know what i mentioned fourth dimension in science science fifth dimension um it speaks of um uh the the souls that are uh are sleeping this one is saying that they mentioned and the non-believers well the fifth dimension which is hell okay so he says that the unbelievers they go to the fifth dimension and the believers go to the sixth dimension so cathy the goddess and the seventh dimension and so the question is there are people who are abandoned that when they on the on the white throne judgment the millennium that life the eternal life that there's nobody going together in life on the white front judge whoever will be given it already possessed [Music] but those souls that will receive grace whatever the name is the finish sir when the white front judgment in general is because they had already received it this way right now now now catch but they may not come in the rapture that's true is that true it's the truth so they [Music] because all those who believe in christ got one place i'm christopher i do not exactly know if they were with with the others with the the others who were under 60 dimension i don't exactly know if they were with the others who were waiting to get resurrection this is one that i want to uh look at more carefully who shall be these kings of the earth bringing uh glory into this okay i don't understand this into this city okay can you read for me revelation twenty one twenty uh could be cool can you read that in english for me i think he's talking about the city when i okay then you have an underneath okay verses um 21 verses 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and horner into it and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there now i believe that the bible says we the bride are the kings and the priests by the way do you know that you were king and priest over deutsche main jury cover the moment you believe christ and receive the holy ghost is that christian of name you you come into arroyo into royals oh yeah [Music] and we will also have glory because it says which part is that and they shall walk okay they shall walk in the light okay of course we always sing the song we will walk in the light the beautiful light okay then it says uh which verse is that again please 20 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it yes god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and i believe that all those people because there are those that are saved but not kings not in royalty not not not the bride so i for now believe that these kings will be the bride when you get it we will bring our glory into the city okay there's another one here but all these questions that brother you've asked i need to go through them again when i'm not tired they're deep and they need deeper studies because at this youthful age it's when boys and girls are attracted to each other and they and they jump pitch it can come back in the future when one is old for the notion of the first time for everything okay now [Music] you don't indulge in what the world does say when you are moving and you live as a different man praise the name of the lord so we are done with all the questions we've gone through with most of them i see i have i am not the one who asked that question i would like you pastor to talk about forgiveness be bilically i irrespective of what it is oh okay you're saying you're not the one who asked the question about forgiveness but you want to admit about forgiveness clarify your discussion that's why i said i'll go in detail in need but i just say that believers forgive i don't think you can explain forgiveness i don't know some people have hearts that they can't forgive somebody even when someone asked for forgiveness but the scripture teaches us if you're only going to say if someone has done something against your mother nature because they listen go to them gain the charity don't wait for them to come to you yes maybe they don't know that they did that you go to them tell them you have been offended [Music] they do is contrary you'll never become done without them you are alone what do you do
