[1:28:20] word uh I just wanted to first of all
[1:28:24] appreciate you uh the church
[1:28:27] here for your
[1:28:31] commitment towards the contribution of
[1:28:34] the land
[1:28:37] fund please clap for
[1:28:42] yourselves last week we contributed
[1:28:44] about
[1:28:49] 98,000 and uh and uh that was a good
[1:28:54] start I know some people have said it is
[1:28:57] difficult it is uh you know P pestering
[1:29:02] the
[1:29:05] people uh it is putting people in
[1:29:08] pressure um that could all be
[1:29:12] true but also we need to learn
[1:29:15] something that if you are going to get
[1:29:18] anything good in
[1:29:20] life you have to be determined to get
[1:29:27] it you know if you're not
[1:29:30] determined and you not
[1:29:32] committed you can never get
[1:29:35] anything uh Israel was given and
[1:29:38] promised the
[1:29:40] land but they had to take it by
[1:29:43] force when they got there others were
[1:29:46] very
[1:29:48] discouraged but the few who were
[1:29:50] encouraged Joshua and calb did not play
[1:29:54] around and they encouraged the whole
[1:29:57] team they said give me my
[1:30:00] Mountain I think it was Cal said give me
[1:30:02] my
[1:30:03] mountain and you know he had to take his
[1:30:06] possession by
[1:30:07] force because he had a promise so it's
[1:30:11] not easy nothing good is received
[1:30:14] easy and so we are not pressuring
[1:30:19] anybody we we these are free will
[1:30:21] control
[1:30:23] RS and you are free to give as much as
[1:30:27] you
[1:30:28] can but also give
[1:30:31] generously and let me tell you a secret
[1:30:34] throughout this entire process as we
[1:30:37] give you are going to see a lot of
[1:30:39] financial breakthrough in our
[1:30:42] church especially to those who are
[1:30:44] giving
[1:30:46] generously generous does not mean giving
[1:30:50] much it means giving with an abundant
[1:30:55] heart and a willing heart and you give
[1:30:58] as much as your heart has been you know
[1:31:01] Desiring to
[1:31:03] give and so if you want to give
[1:31:05] generously you cannot give
[1:31:08] little when you have much more so you
[1:31:11] give as God has blessed
[1:31:13] you and then he will give you
[1:31:16] more for you to
[1:31:19] give so don't feel pressured
[1:31:23] if you can only afford a
[1:31:26] little don't say I've heard of some who
[1:31:28] say well now how can we you know others

[1:38:32] details when my assistant is here next
[1:38:35] Sunday I'm sure he will do a better
[1:38:39] job so it's almost mid
[1:38:42] midday and I'm requesting you for one
[1:38:45] hour hour and a
[1:38:47] half so you keep your thoughts together
[1:38:51] do not count
[1:38:53] time uh let us be here
[1:38:57] 100% and because I have a
[1:39:00] message in my
[1:39:02] heart for the especially this goes to
[1:39:05] the young
[1:39:06] people many have been asking me
[1:39:09] questions some here in the church and
[1:39:13] others also out of the
[1:39:14] church and I thought for about 3 weeks
[1:39:17] I've wanted to deal with
[1:39:20] this uh but I think I should deal with
[1:39:22] it
[1:39:24] today I'm going to speak on the approach
[1:39:26] to
[1:39:32] marriage approach the the way you
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:48] approach the approach to marriage
[1:39:57] yes that is
[1:40:00] better
[1:40:02] yes the way you enter into marriage no
[1:40:06] the approach to
[1:40:09] marriage so now this is not only going
[1:40:12] to help the younger
[1:40:14] people but also the
[1:40:16] parents because you have
[1:40:18] children and you want don't think about
[1:40:21] yourself also think about your
[1:40:23] children because in a few years from now
[1:40:27] many of you your children are going to
[1:40:28] get
[1:40:31] married you need to to guide them
[1:40:34] properly so before we go to the
[1:40:37] award especially because of this program
[1:40:40] that we
[1:40:43] started the
[1:40:45] interviews we really needed a second
[1:40:49] camera and uh the Isaac the brother in
[1:40:53] the media Department told me we need um
[1:40:56] this camera cost about uh about 15
[1:41:02] million uh but he had found one person
[1:41:05] only who has it in the city and he has
[1:41:08] it in second hand and they can give it
[1:41:10] to us at 7
[1:41:16] Millions so I contacted the
[1:41:19] man and we negot with him down to
[1:41:23] mil some people have told me I'm a good
[1:41:28] negotiator I I hope they are
[1:41:30] right because it was successful this
[1:41:34] time from Seven went to
[1:41:38] five and I told him
[1:41:40] look by faith I had to give what I
[1:41:44] had and I took it out of the church
[1:41:48] account believing that God will supply
[1:41:50] and will be able to put it
[1:41:53] back and so I took 2 million
[1:41:56] Shillings I told him I have 2 million
[1:41:58] shs I'm going to pay it right away and
[1:42:02] then the 3 Millions we shall give it in
[1:42:04] two
[1:42:05] months he said two months is
[1:42:08] Big actually I said three months he said
[1:42:10] three months is big two
[1:42:12] months so we have to pay 1.5 1.5 for the
[1:42:16] next two
[1:42:18] months and as I was still you know Isaac
[1:42:21] was still in
[1:42:23] town then I was contacted by one of us
[1:42:25] here
[1:42:27] sister asking me Pastor how much is a
[1:42:30] camera like the one we use at
[1:42:33] church I told her well right now we are
[1:42:35] buying
[1:42:37] one and I told her like what I've told
[1:42:40] you she said I will contribute for
[1:42:43] sure so somehow she asked the right
[1:42:45] question at the right
[1:42:47] time so uh and I think that's the over
[1:42:52] there these things in the media
[1:42:54] Department are very
[1:42:57] expensive but when I see the people that
[1:42:59] are
[1:43:01] blessed because of what they receive
[1:43:03] from
[1:43:04] us I really feel that this is
[1:43:08] nothing compared to the souls that are
[1:43:11] impacted in their
[1:43:13] lives so if you feel to support that as
[1:43:17] well it is an opportunity to receive a
[1:43:19] blessing
[1:43:22] praise the Lord shall We
[1:43:35] Stand uh while we um have our Bibles
[1:43:39] open to Genesis
[1:43:44] 2 vers
[1:43:48] 18 so we are going to read before we're
[1:43:51] going to pray before
[1:43:54] we let's pray our loving
[1:43:59] Jesus we would like to thank you this
[1:44:01] this
[1:44:02] morning for the opportunity you have
[1:44:05] given to us Lord to gather
[1:44:09] here many have come from different
[1:44:12] places some from Far others from near
[1:44:17] Lord I know even some have traveled uh
[1:44:20] from as far
[1:44:23] as just to be here Lord in this service
[1:44:27] and from other places as well father I
[1:44:29] ask that you will let our gathering not
[1:44:32] be in
[1:44:34] vain and even others that are streaming
[1:44:36] with us maybe they are part of this
[1:44:39] fellowship and not able to
[1:44:41] come or maybe they from another
[1:44:44] location but they've been led to stream
[1:44:47] with us this
[1:44:49] morning maybe others will watch this
[1:44:52] after they have attended their church
[1:44:54] service Lord I pray that it will be a
[1:44:58] blessing Lord everybody that will be
[1:45:00] under the sound of the voice this
[1:45:03] morning may you uh impact their
[1:45:06] lives Lead Me Lord guide me and inspire
[1:45:10] me that what I speak Lord will uh Avail
[1:45:15] much
[1:45:16] spiritually to your people father Lord
[1:45:19] we ask your blessing
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:25] amen and the Lord God said it is not
[1:45:28] good that the man should be alone I will
[1:45:31] make him and help meet for
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:45] him God bless you you may be
[1:45:48] seated well of course one of the other
[1:45:51] reasons I'm taking this subject is
[1:45:52] because uh since after the wedding of
[1:45:55] brother uh of brother Andrew and also
[1:45:59] the prayer we prayed at the beginning of
[1:46:01] the
[1:46:07] year it looks like we have a lot of
[1:46:10] Dynamics going on in the church for
[1:46:11] people who want to get into
[1:46:17] marriage and I've noticed that many of
[1:46:19] them ask questions the same questions
[1:46:24] repeated so I thought I should just deal
[1:46:26] with it
[1:46:28] today so that we can set a
[1:46:31] standard on what we believe
[1:46:34] here and how we believe is the right
[1:46:37] approach to
[1:46:40] marriage now matters regarding marriage
[1:46:43] um will vary in understanding from
[1:46:46] church to
[1:46:49] church
[1:46:51] and so I just want you to hear what we
[1:46:55] believe and if you have any questions
[1:46:58] afterwards we can also deal with
[1:47:01] those so I I want to also read Hebrews
[1:47:09] 13:4 just one verse marriage is
[1:47:12] Honorable in all and the bed and defiled
[1:47:15] but war mongers and adulterers God will
[1:47:19] judge
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:38] so now I'm going to begin it this way
[1:47:41] looking at Genesis CH 2
[1:47:44] ver8 where he says it is not good that
[1:47:46] the man should be
[1:47:49] alone
[1:47:50] so the first question is why is it not
[1:47:54] good that the man should
[1:47:57] be I'm going to answer this question
[1:48:00] with several other
[1:48:03] scriptures in the Book of Ecclesiastes 4
[1:48:06] verse
[1:48:07] 9 it says two are better than
[1:48:12] one because they have a good reward for
[1:48:15] their
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:18] labor so if you one you are good but if
[1:48:21] you are two you it is
[1:48:25] better why because you have a good
[1:48:28] reward for your
[1:48:32] labor for if they fall the one will lift
[1:48:35] up his
[1:48:38] fellow many times you realize to you who
[1:48:41] are married when you are downcast you
[1:48:43] know like yesterday had you know issues
[1:48:45] with this and that and so I was just a
[1:48:47] little bit done cast but my wife you
[1:48:49] know took to encouraging
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:49:00] me you know she started talking to me as
[1:49:02] if she was my
[1:49:04] pastor and after the talking I felt a
[1:49:06] bit
[1:49:08] better so you see if you are two if one
[1:49:12] Falls the one will lift up his
[1:49:15] fellow but why to him that is
[1:49:19] alone when he
[1:49:21] fth for he has not another to help him
[1:49:25] up you are only by
[1:49:27] yourself and you know you are you're
[1:49:30] battling with your
[1:49:32] thoughts you don't trust anybody because
[1:49:35] you cannot share with them your
[1:49:38] secrets but when you have another one
[1:49:41] with you you can be able to share your
[1:49:44] secrets that's why never trust a married
[1:49:48] person and tell them telling you don't
[1:49:50] tell your
[1:49:52] wife I telling you the
[1:49:55] reality they will always share with
[1:49:57] their
[1:49:59] wives that is the truth if if that
[1:50:03] marriage is
[1:50:04] healthy they will always share
[1:50:07] information that is what marriage is all
[1:50:09] about you know and so they will share
[1:50:12] with one
[1:50:13] another and so the other will lift up
[1:50:16] another one but if you are only one you
[1:50:19] don't have another one to help
[1:50:21] you to get up when you're
[1:50:25] down again if two lie
[1:50:28] together then they have
[1:50:31] heat so imagine he says but how can one
[1:50:34] be warm
[1:50:37] alone you see that's another reason why
[1:50:40] it is not good for a man to be
[1:50:43] alone that's why it is not good for
[1:50:45] married people to live
[1:50:49] apart opens channels and ways for
[1:50:53] adultery because the Bible says when you
[1:50:55] are
[1:50:57] called you know and you have another one
[1:50:59] with
[1:51:00] you then you will have
[1:51:03] Heats then the bed will be
[1:51:05] warm but imagine if it is the cold
[1:51:08] season and you're all by
[1:51:11] yourself the devil is going to begin
[1:51:13] attacking
[1:51:14] you of this and that and immoral living
[1:51:20] but you see how can one be warm
[1:51:24] alone and if one Prevail against
[1:51:27] him two shall withand
[1:51:31] him praise the name of the Lord so apart
[1:51:34] from
[1:51:35] one there is also you know when you are
[1:51:39] attacked you know when you attacked but
[1:51:43] you have your friend you are together
[1:51:46] with your wife or
[1:51:48] husband you know you will with with
[1:51:50] stand that person that comes to attack
[1:51:52] you you will withand that Spirit which
[1:51:54] comes to attack you you will pray
[1:51:57] together you will believe together you
[1:52:00] will plan together you know that's what
[1:52:02] marriage is all about and then he says
[1:52:05] under three fold
[1:52:10] C is not quickly
[1:52:15] broken a threefold
[1:52:18] c now here is not talking about two
[1:52:20] wives one
[1:52:23] husband he's talking about one wife one
[1:52:28] husband and
[1:52:30] Goden if you are married and you have
[1:52:33] your wife and you know you have God in
[1:52:36] that
[1:52:37] marriage that marriage is not quickly
[1:52:41] broken you see many marriages that break
[1:52:44] it
[1:52:45] down is because they do not build their
[1:52:47] house on the basis of God on the laws of
[1:52:49] God
[1:52:52] but if a family is started on the on the
[1:52:55] right
[1:52:57] basis and that is Jesus Christ that
[1:53:00] family is not quickly
[1:53:02] broken the devil can try to
[1:53:05] fight devil can come from here from
[1:53:08] there from here but the devil cannot
[1:53:10] quickly break it he has tried to break
[1:53:14] some not easily not easily and even when
[1:53:18] he breaks them as long as God is still
[1:53:21] there those families always come back
[1:53:24] again
[1:53:25] together so if you from a marriage that
[1:53:29] is broken and you are
[1:53:31] here you just make sure God is
[1:53:34] there Whoever has left that
[1:53:37] c will come back again if it is your
[1:53:41] wife he will come she will come back
[1:53:42] again if it's your husband he will come
[1:53:45] back
[1:53:46] again a three-fold cod is not quickly
[1:53:49] broken
[1:53:52] and so we are still answering why it is
[1:53:53] not good for a man to
[1:53:56] be praise the Lord I know you are
[1:53:59] listening but I want more of your
[1:54:02] amens if you are quiet I will go
[1:54:06] dry my gift rides on your on your
[1:54:11] receiving that amen Proverbs
[1:54:14] 122 A Good Man obtain favor of the
[1:54:18] Lord
[1:54:20] but a man of wicked devices will he
[1:54:26] condemn so now if the Bible says if you
[1:54:28] are
[1:54:29] good look at yourself
[1:54:31] man if you are good you obtain favor
[1:54:35] from
[1:54:36] God now the question is are you
[1:54:40] good as far as God is
[1:54:42] concerned if you are good you obtain
[1:54:45] favor from God and how do we know you
[1:54:48] obtain favor from God
[1:54:51] Proverbs
[1:54:52] 1822 whoever find a
[1:54:56] wife find a good
[1:54:59] things and obtain favor of the
[1:55:03] Lord so in other words it is not good
[1:55:06] for a man to
[1:55:07] be but when a man finds a wife he finds
[1:55:11] a good
[1:55:13] thing and he obtains favor from God so
[1:55:17] in other words when God gives you a wife
[1:55:20] it is God's
[1:55:22] testimony about you that you are
[1:55:28] good so if you don't have
[1:55:30] one may God testimony against
[1:55:34] you praise the name of the
[1:55:37] Lord praise the name of the
[1:55:40] Lord okay 1 Corinthians
[1:55:44] 78 all right I'm still answering the
[1:55:47] same
[1:55:48] question
[1:55:51] I say therefore to the unmarried and
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:55] widows it is good for them if they abide
[1:55:58] even as
[1:56:01] I not like me because me he's talking
[1:56:04] about apost
[1:56:06] Paul he was not married so it was he
[1:56:09] says it is good you remain like
[1:56:11] me but if they cannot
[1:56:15] contain let them
[1:56:18] marry
[1:56:21] for it is better to marry than to
[1:56:26] burn you know people use a lot of things
[1:56:29] that are so
[1:56:30] funny you find them they have
[1:56:33] Toys you know they play with themselves
[1:56:37] you find them you know and many of these
[1:56:39] are
[1:56:40] Christians believers they in
[1:56:44] churches why you are burning brother you
[1:56:47] are burning sister and the Bible says it
[1:56:51] is better for you to
[1:56:54] marry than to
[1:56:57] burn no Amen on
[1:56:59] that no Amen on that what you to say
[1:57:04] Amen marriage is is not worldly it is
[1:57:10] spiritual it is not a want it is a
[1:57:15] need it's not a want it is a need
[1:57:23] are you are you hearing me you young
[1:57:25] people to say
[1:57:26] Amen don't beh so spiritual this
[1:57:30] morning but but if they cannot contain
[1:57:33] let them
[1:57:35] marry but it is better to marry than to
[1:57:39] burn why does he even say this because
[1:57:42] to the
[1:57:43] believer to a Christian forication is
[1:57:47] not is a noo area
[1:57:51] it's a no
[1:57:53] Zone and fornication imoral living is a
[1:57:55] no
[1:57:57] area the Bible says it should even be
[1:58:00] one time mentioned among
[1:58:04] you and he says if one be a
[1:58:07] pH don't even eat with
[1:58:10] him and he says he's not talking about
[1:58:12] everybody in the
[1:58:13] world because everybody in the world
[1:58:16] almost is a
[1:58:18] pH say case then we should not even live
[1:58:20] in the
[1:58:22] world he saying he's talking about those
[1:58:26] that are called by the name
[1:58:28] brother by the name sister and you are
[1:58:31] living in
[1:58:33] immorality you are having you are
[1:58:36] fornicating around the Bible says when
[1:58:39] we find out unless you repent and you
[1:58:43] change your ways we should not even
[1:58:46] fellowship with you we should not even
[1:58:48] eat with you
[1:58:50] because it is unclean
[1:58:52] living it takes away the glory of God
[1:58:55] from the
[1:58:57] church and then down here he says now if
[1:59:02] they
[1:59:03] burn well of course you are human be
[1:59:06] whether or not you're filled with the
[1:59:07] Holy Ghost your body will burn as long
[1:59:11] as you are still
[1:59:13] young and you are you are not
[1:59:16] old well of course if you're old like
[1:59:18] David
[1:59:20] you know they brought him I think was it
[1:59:24] abish and he could not even do
[1:59:27] anything the best he could receive was
[1:59:30] worms but we see here unto the mared I
[1:59:36] command yet not I but the
[1:59:39] Lord so here is the God's
[1:59:43] commandment let not the wife depart from
[1:59:46] her
[1:59:48] husband I know there are many issues in
[1:59:51] marriage and problems come up and issues
[1:59:55] come up and that's all understandable
[1:59:58] but here he says let not the wife depart
[2:00:01] from her
[2:00:04] husband it's not my words are you
[2:00:07] hearing me church it's the word of God
[2:00:10] sisters if you are married the Bible
[2:00:12] says
[2:00:13] turn never
[2:00:15] depart never go away why we need to
[2:00:18] teach about the approach
[2:00:21] of because many people want to
[2:00:25] divorce or to depart from their
[2:00:27] husbands they are those that approached
[2:00:31] the wrong
[2:00:33] way but you who are not yet married you
[2:00:36] have an opportunity this
[2:00:38] morning that we can we can teach you the
[2:00:41] right
[2:00:42] approach and when you hear it believe it
[2:00:44] and do
[2:00:45] it and God will give you a good marriage
[2:00:50] but and if she
[2:00:53] departs yeah he understands it may be
[2:00:55] difficult for you to stay especially if
[2:00:57] the husband is abusive for
[2:01:02] example even me as a pastor I cannot
[2:01:04] encourage you to stay with a man who is
[2:01:10] abusive if he's beating you up or
[2:01:12] psychologic torturing you and like
[2:01:16] that so God understands that and so Paul
[2:01:20] said and but if she
[2:01:23] depart let her remain
[2:01:27] [Music]
[2:01:29] un or be reconciled to her
[2:01:34] husband the only way a woman can
[2:01:39] Remar her first husband is
[2:01:43] dead and if your first husband is not
[2:01:46] dead you cannot remember
[2:01:49] Mar if you rem you are living in
[2:01:53] ad if you want to REM well you can REM
[2:01:56] your
[2:01:58] husband and let not the husband put away
[2:02:00] his
[2:02:02] wife the moment you marry you not going
[2:02:05] to say you go back your people you
[2:02:08] cannot do that you are married once and
[2:02:13] forever forever and ever
[2:02:15] amen even if you say when mared her she
[2:02:20] was looking beautiful she was Slender
[2:02:23] but now you know she been
[2:02:26] breastfeeding you know her breast is
[2:02:28] down now and even she's now
[2:02:31] B so now I cannot continue with that I'm
[2:02:35] not longer attracted to her I want to
[2:02:37] find another one no you should not
[2:02:39] divorce your
[2:02:40] wife she's your forever and ever
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:46] am are you hearing me don't even let
[2:02:49] those thoughts cross your
[2:02:52] mind praise the name of the Lord now we
[2:02:56] I've already answered you the question
[2:02:57] is why a man should
[2:03:00] marry why a woman also should get
[2:03:04] married but then he says I will make him
[2:03:07] and help me for
[2:03:09] him in Genesis
[2:03:13] 2:8 the Bible says now the Lord God say
[2:03:16] now this is the Amplified version it is
[2:03:19] not good meaning it is not
[2:03:22] sufficient it is not
[2:03:25] satisfactory that the man should be
[2:03:28] alone I will make him who makes for him
[2:03:33] who makes for him me chch who makes for
[2:03:36] the man God makes for the
[2:03:38] man I will make him don't worry about it
[2:03:43] sister amen God Made You for
[2:03:46] a don't worry about way
[2:03:50] knows him just pray believe and
[2:03:54] wait don't a brother God has made you a
[2:03:59] helpen if you not married and youing for
[2:04:02] a wife I want you to repeat after me my
[2:04:06] wife is
[2:04:07] somewhere God has made my wife one of
[2:04:11] these
[2:04:12] days going to see her it's a
[2:04:16] revelation and God says I will make him
[2:04:21] a
[2:04:23] meet me which means
[2:04:27] s
[2:04:29] aded
[2:04:31] compliment
[2:04:34] for sir not every woman is suitable or
[2:04:40] adopted to
[2:04:42] you are you hearing not everything I'm
[2:04:46] sorry to use that word that is called a
[2:04:47] woman
[2:04:51] that can be your wife your wife is a
[2:04:54] particular
[2:04:57] person are you hearing me now and I'm
[2:05:00] not talking about this kind of thing
[2:05:02] that you know we were you know known
[2:05:03] before no no what I'm saying according
[2:05:06] to our
[2:05:08] characters according to our ways we are
[2:05:12] raised is the way our brains
[2:05:15] function God knows
[2:05:17] you will choose for you someone that is
[2:05:22] suitable someone that is adapted to you
[2:05:26] know not everybody can be your
[2:05:28] husband there is one person and who
[2:05:31] knows that person only God knows
[2:05:35] that your mother doesn't know your
[2:05:38] father doesn't know your doesn't know
[2:05:41] but God knows that
[2:05:43] person that's why sometimes we may want
[2:05:46] someone to marry someone so bad
[2:05:50] but you know what God reveals to
[2:05:53] you who is suitable for
[2:05:56] you and we'll find out
[2:05:58] how you have to find the will of
[2:06:02] God on who she is it comes to you by
[2:06:08] Revelation and our Prophet say that
[2:06:10] faith is a
[2:06:12] revelation so in other words it comes to
[2:06:15] you by
[2:06:16] faith while you are praying
[2:06:20] ration and when Revelation stes who she
[2:06:24] is amen the will of God will not be
[2:06:28] known to
[2:06:29] you and the will of God can only be
[2:06:32] known in one
[2:06:36] way
[2:06:39] prayer it is not asking people how do
[2:06:42] you say
[2:06:47] that how do you see
[2:06:50] that how do you and people young people
[2:06:54] make this
[2:06:55] mistakes stop foolish things you can't
[2:07:00] find your wife like
[2:07:02] that one man is test is another one is
[2:07:05] another
[2:07:07] man so don't ask people to choose for
[2:07:12] you some people even come to me Pastor
[2:07:15] for me which one is better this one or
[2:07:19] this one you have a problem to begin
[2:07:22] with you have to find the will of
[2:07:26] God God is not an
[2:07:29] object God is God God is a person as in
[2:07:34] he has his own
[2:07:36] characteristics his behavior his
[2:07:39] character he speaks he
[2:07:42] hears amen he moves are you hearing me
[2:07:46] so if you believe in God
[2:07:49] you will ask God and God will answer
[2:07:56] God the first point I'm going into
[2:07:59] now we have now
[2:08:02] known why a man should not be
[2:08:06] alone some men desire to be alone you
[2:08:11] have a bad
[2:08:13] Revelation if you are alone is one of
[2:08:16] the reasons you are not completely sold
[2:08:18] to God
[2:08:21] you find some of these
[2:08:23] priests they deceived them they lie them
[2:08:28] and they tell them they should not get
[2:08:30] married and that if you don't get
[2:08:32] married You Are
[2:08:33] Holy that is not correct the Bible
[2:08:36] actually says those are doctrines of
[2:08:40] devils have you ever read it in the
[2:08:42] Bible in the book of Galatians he says
[2:08:46] those are do of
[2:08:47] devils
[2:08:48] people who forbid to
[2:08:51] marry and those who forbid people to eat
[2:08:54] some
[2:08:56] Meats he said those are teaching
[2:08:58] doctrines of
[2:09:01] devils can we read it now in the book of
[2:09:04] Galatians
[2:09:06] 3 I'm trying to open it here I have not
[2:09:08] prepared to read
[2:09:13] it these are very important
[2:09:16] principles for us to know
[2:09:19] and walk in them
[2:09:25] somebody chapter
[2:09:30] 3 oh first
[2:09:34] Timothy why was I thinking it is
[2:09:37] Galatians First Timothy chapter
[2:09:41] what chapter
[2:09:44] 4
[2:09:46] okay verses
[2:09:50] yes God bless you told must be a
[2:09:54] preacher uhhuh listen now the spirit
[2:09:57] speaketh
[2:09:58] expressly that in the latter times amen
[2:10:01] some shall depart from the
[2:10:09] faith how will they depart from the
[2:10:12] faith when they depart they will give he
[2:10:15] to seducing
[2:10:17] spirits
[2:10:18] and the doctrines of
[2:10:21] devils did you know the devil has
[2:10:25] doctrines and these people speak lies in
[2:10:30] hypocrisy having their consci seared
[2:10:33] with a hot
[2:10:35] iron forbidding to
[2:10:38] marry these are the
[2:10:40] doctrines of
[2:10:42] devils forbidden to do what to
[2:10:46] Mar even to today we have some very
[2:10:50] spiritual men of
[2:10:52] God when you tell them about marriage
[2:10:55] they will be
[2:10:57] negative they would be
[2:10:59] negative negative why because they think
[2:11:03] that to talk negative about marriages to
[2:11:06] be
[2:11:09] spiritual no no no no no no no those are
[2:11:11] doctrines of
[2:11:13] devils amen you have to talk positive
[2:11:16] about marriage
[2:11:18] because it is the will of
[2:11:22] God so those who forbid to marry they
[2:11:25] tell them you married to the
[2:11:27] church you are a brother you are n you
[2:11:31] are this and that those are doctrines of
[2:11:35] devil having their where he says and
[2:11:38] commanding to abstain from
[2:11:42] Meats which God has created to be
[2:11:45] received with Thanksgiving of them which
[2:11:49] believe and know the
[2:11:51] truth so they even refuse people to eat
[2:11:55] meat they said don't eat pork because
[2:11:59] pork is cast but the Bible has say
[2:12:03] whoever says those things is teaching
[2:12:06] doctrines of
[2:12:07] devils because that was true in the Old
[2:12:12] Testament the Old Testament was the
[2:12:15] shadow of the
[2:12:16] new from the day
[2:12:19] the blood of Jesus was
[2:12:21] shed a New Covenant was
[2:12:24] introduced and under the New Covenant
[2:12:27] there is nothing
[2:12:29] Unholy everything can be
[2:12:33] eaten you can eat your pork and praise
[2:12:35] the
[2:12:37] Lord come on Church how many love FK
[2:12:42] here amen we can eat anything any meat
[2:12:47] as long as we prayed over it the Bible
[2:12:50] say is
[2:12:51] Sanctified by the word of God and
[2:12:54] pray so don't listen to those who forbid
[2:12:58] you to get
[2:13:00] married as long as you are of
[2:13:06] age all right so how do you approach PR
[2:13:10] uh
[2:13:11] marriage first prayer and the prophet of
[2:13:15] God was asked a question
[2:13:18] in in questions and
[2:13:20] answers how do you feel is the best way
[2:13:22] to find the Lord how do you feel is the
[2:13:25] best way to find the Lord's will in some
[2:13:27] important
[2:13:29] [Music]
[2:13:35] matters what the best
[2:13:38] way find God's
[2:13:41] will in some important
[2:13:44] matters are you listening to me young
[2:13:46] people that's 10% of you are you
[2:13:50] listening 20% are you
[2:13:53] listening all right now listen he says
[2:13:56] this I had to do that because many times
[2:13:59] we preach this and they say we did not
[2:14:04] know now you have to
[2:14:07] know I tell you dear friend the best way
[2:14:11] to find the will of
[2:14:14] God some important
[2:14:16] matter is a
[2:14:19] prayer can you say Amen to that it is
[2:14:23] prayer if you have a matter that is very
[2:14:28] important is there any other matter
[2:14:30] apart from salvation that is important
[2:14:37] Mar no
[2:14:39] sure now here is the way I do it I take
[2:14:43] it before the Lord and it has always
[2:14:46] been my strength
[2:14:49] I
[2:14:50] wait upon the Lord I see what he
[2:14:54] says and I just let myself
[2:15:00] neutral you know you've not you've not
[2:15:03] made the choice
[2:15:04] yet but you are praying before you make
[2:15:07] the
[2:15:08] choice prayer happens before you make
[2:15:11] the
[2:15:14] choice not
[2:15:16] afterward and so you are
[2:15:19] neutral you don't know where to go you
[2:15:23] are praying oh God lead
[2:15:25] me God speak to me oh God guide me are
[2:15:29] you listening to
[2:15:31] me don't take either
[2:15:34] side and say now heavenly
[2:15:38] father because now in my case most of
[2:15:42] the
[2:15:46] time
[2:15:49] if it is very
[2:15:50] important I wait on a
[2:15:54] vision but many people God doesn't deal
[2:15:57] with
[2:16:03] Invision how many see
[2:16:07] Visions all right a few hands around now
[2:16:11] if everybody of
[2:16:12] you was waiting for a vision because
[2:16:15] said he was waiting for a vision
[2:16:19] let me pray until I see a
[2:16:22] vis no God doesn't deal with you that
[2:16:26] way are you following me now when you go
[2:16:30] to prayer you don't wait a brother to
[2:16:33] come and talk to you and then you go to
[2:16:35] pray you don't want to see a
[2:16:38] sister and then you go to
[2:16:40] pray I saw what you you had posted the
[2:16:43] other time brother
[2:16:45] Prince what was the name of the sister
[2:16:49] sister
[2:16:50] joy and this man was praying oh God give
[2:16:54] me sister Joy I Jo I
[2:17:01] die you don't pray like
[2:17:03] that you you your arm twisting
[2:17:07] God that is not a prayer that is
[2:17:10] last last is killing you and you're
[2:17:13] taking it before
[2:17:16] God
[2:17:18] go to prayer before you see sister
[2:17:22] Joy the prayer you pray after you see
[2:17:24] sister Joy is
[2:17:28] different okay follow me closely now
[2:17:31] because now in most times so many people
[2:17:33] I would advice for you to do
[2:17:37] that to wait on a vision because it's
[2:17:40] just some people that has visions and
[2:17:42] some does something
[2:17:45] else others they just get a revelation
[2:17:49] they see a dream others they just
[2:17:51] believe the
[2:17:52] word right others God may speak to you
[2:17:55] through a
[2:17:57] prophet God deals with people in
[2:18:00] different
[2:18:02] ways where you do something else that I
[2:18:05] couldn't
[2:18:08] do in your way of serving the
[2:18:10] lord I do something that you couldn't
[2:18:14] do so God deals with us different
[2:18:18] so I would if I was in your
[2:18:22] place and I didn't have visions from the
[2:18:25] Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and
[2:18:30] say Lord now you show me what is the
[2:18:34] decision to
[2:18:36] make and then the way you feel led
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:42] to wait just a little
[2:18:45] bit then wait a little bit
[2:18:49] and see which
[2:18:51] way which side you lean
[2:18:53] towards which way the spirit now father
[2:18:56] in my
[2:18:58] heart you know it doesn't matter which
[2:19:03] way you pray and you say but I want to
[2:19:05] know what you want to do
[2:19:08] about that's the way I do about meeting
[2:19:11] some
[2:19:13] sometimes when he's invited to meeting
[2:19:15] some
[2:19:16] places I feel kind of late to go this
[2:19:19] way or that way then I will follow this
[2:19:24] way that's the way to do it because the
[2:19:27] matter is in prayer
[2:19:30] then you are doing the best you
[2:19:33] can and I believe this my
[2:19:35] friend as Paul in the New
[2:19:38] Testament in the days going by he was
[2:19:41] between two
[2:19:43] straights which way he should go and he
[2:19:46] started on going the wrong
[2:19:48] road and he got a
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:19:56] maian and and he turned back and if you
[2:20:00] are making a
[2:20:02] decision for God and do the best that
[2:20:06] you
[2:20:07] can I believe God listen to this I
[2:20:10] believe God will correct
[2:20:16] you
[2:20:18] and see that you do not go or do it
[2:20:23] wrong I believe God will do
[2:20:26] it are you following me young people
[2:20:30] prayer is the matter
[2:20:32] here marriage without prayer is not
[2:20:36] marriage pray and then
[2:20:39] listen pray and then
[2:20:41] wait pray and then see what God needs
[2:20:44] you to
[2:20:45] do praise the name of the Lord
[2:20:48] so now the question is how long do you
[2:20:51] pray it depends on who you
[2:20:54] are if you a man you
[2:20:57] pray until you receive
[2:21:00] Revelation if you a sister you pray and
[2:21:06] wait now the question is is it possible
[2:21:10] for you sister a desire of a kind of a
[2:21:13] man you
[2:21:15] want yes it is possible is it possible
[2:21:19] for God to speak to you about the kind
[2:21:22] of man you will
[2:21:23] marry yes it is possible but what do you
[2:21:27] do about
[2:21:28] it
[2:21:31] wait sister don't pray and after
[2:21:35] praying you come back and
[2:21:37] say and deons these young men moving out
[2:21:40] you have to make sure that they come
[2:21:41] back quickly because they going to
[2:21:44] miss
[2:21:46] have
[2:21:52] have please do your duty these things
[2:21:56] very important because these young
[2:21:58] people are the ones going to do
[2:22:01] mistakes so listen when you
[2:22:05] pray you don't
[2:22:07] pray sister and then you
[2:22:11] say I've seen
[2:22:13] him
[2:22:15] brother God has spoken
[2:22:21] God has told me the right one for
[2:22:24] me and the brother says but God never
[2:22:29] spoke no brother you the one the brother
[2:22:32] begins to
[2:22:35] go spoke to
[2:22:37] me it doesn't happen that
[2:22:42] way when God speaks to
[2:22:45] you about who is supposed to be your
[2:22:52] husband but for the man after you have
[2:22:55] prayed and you wait until you receive
[2:22:59] Revelation you don't start praying and
[2:23:02] after you see
[2:23:05] her you start well before you see
[2:23:09] anyone you put out a list of what you
[2:23:14] need and then ask the Bible say says ask
[2:23:18] and he shall
[2:23:20] receive you can put out a
[2:23:23] list I need a brother who has this I
[2:23:27] need is it possible yes it is possible
[2:23:32] you put out a list of the things
[2:23:35] you before
[2:23:38] God but you don't say to God it is this
[2:23:41] or
[2:23:46] nothing this is what I
[2:23:48] want but Lead Me To Your
[2:23:52] Way praise the name of the Lord whoever
[2:23:55] your wife or husband
[2:23:58] is is right
[2:24:00] here in
[2:24:03] you it is only you that has a
[2:24:06] vision of her it is only you that can
[2:24:10] know who she is and when God tells you
[2:24:13] who she is you will receive a revelation
[2:24:17] of who she is Sister you also receive a
[2:24:21] revelation God will speak to
[2:24:24] you don't take God out of
[2:24:27] this God is a part of
[2:24:29] this God is the major
[2:24:32] part of a marriage
[2:24:36] proposal Adam was by himself and God
[2:24:39] said it's not
[2:24:41] good for man to be aone I will make him
[2:24:44] a help and God put Adam to
[2:24:48] sleep and
[2:24:49] adamle
[2:24:51] andam
[2:24:53] and for as long as he was
[2:24:57] sleeping God was very busy working with
[2:25:00] his and by the time Adam W up Adam woke
[2:25:04] up out of his sleep his wife was right
[2:25:07] next to him and Adam opened his eyes
[2:25:12] Adam said you are born of my
[2:25:14] bnes here is a revelation
[2:25:17] who saw who
[2:25:19] first Eve must have seen
[2:25:22] Adam because Adam was
[2:25:26] sleeping while was
[2:25:30] aw waiting that's why I said to sisters
[2:25:34] don't wake up Brothers before they see
[2:25:38] you that's why I don't
[2:25:45] believe so that they see
[2:25:50] you things
[2:25:52] which they will not see
[2:25:54] you these days men are very
[2:25:57] rare that is not a spiritual speech that
[2:26:01] is the worldly
[2:26:03] speech cover yourselves
[2:26:06] up your own will
[2:26:09] see even if you're putting when BL your
[2:26:12] will come and when he comes will pass
[2:26:18] and he will see you hallelujah
[2:26:21] amen they TI and
[2:26:28] they they looking for
[2:26:32] men they don't look for men like that
[2:26:35] God Sons they don't look for a wife that
[2:26:38] is dressed like
[2:26:40] that but the sons of Kan will
[2:26:43] see and they will see you very
[2:26:45] fast
[2:26:47] and then you are saying I'm in a bad
[2:26:49] marriage how did you approach it if you
[2:26:53] attracted your
[2:26:55] man that's why he is like
[2:26:58] that how are
[2:27:00] you did you have a of God about
[2:27:03] you women that have a character of
[2:27:06] God will attract sons of
[2:27:10] God but if the character of the world is
[2:27:13] on
[2:27:14] you it will attract sons of K
[2:27:19] oh God Mery those are very strong words
[2:27:21] I know that's the reality and I'm
[2:27:25] speaking to you they un
[2:27:27] mared so sister don't you
[2:27:30] worry dress as a
[2:27:34] Christian live as a
[2:27:36] Christian you don't you don't have
[2:27:39] to you don't need to make your
[2:27:43] St they will see you sister God bless
[2:27:46] you
[2:27:49] [Music]
[2:28:01] so that they can see not the sons of God
[2:28:05] the sons of God when they see
[2:28:10] that what is
[2:28:12] this what is this and brother sister it
[2:28:16] may even be a good
[2:28:18] brother but when you qu
[2:28:21] guy and you wake him
[2:28:23] up wake up I always say this you may
[2:28:27] wake up a
[2:28:29] monster because you know when someone
[2:28:31] still
[2:28:33] has what happens when he Wes
[2:28:41] up
[2:28:44] until when Abraham was being
[2:28:47] oper God injected
[2:28:50] him and he waited wait woman wait wait
[2:28:55] for him to wake up it is the man to
[2:28:58] initiate a
[2:29:01] relationship not a
[2:29:03] woman your place is
[2:29:06] waiting and the brother when he wakes up
[2:29:10] I believe Eve
[2:29:12] smiled the woman
[2:29:14] smiled she knew
[2:29:17] he's about to see me know I know he's
[2:29:22] about to
[2:29:24] see and then when he saw when she saw
[2:29:26] him
[2:29:27] turning I know what he's going to say I
[2:29:31] know and then Adam opened his mou Eve
[2:29:34] was dying
[2:29:37] Joy say it
[2:29:45] Adam if it wasn't the way that God had
[2:29:48] did
[2:29:49] it the woman would have said it
[2:29:54] first let me tell you you don't have to
[2:29:57] force your lifetime
[2:30:02] part you Brothers what is wrong with
[2:30:07] youe woman

[2:30:21] praying leave her
[2:30:23] alone leave her
[2:30:25] alone if she says I'm not even sure I'm
[2:30:29] thinking about leave her leave her
[2:30:33] alone if she's
[2:30:35] yours she won't make you turn around to
[2:30:39] make things
[2:30:40] wrong there and there and there if she's
[2:30:44] yours if you tell her like
[2:30:47] this even you will know that she has
[2:30:50] accepted even if she doesn't say yes you
[2:30:53] will know she has
[2:30:55] accepted I've seen many brothers did the
[2:30:58] sister accept said
[2:31:02] yes you ask what did the sister say she
[2:31:05] said let me pray about it how did you
[2:31:08] know that
[2:31:10] know and at the end of the day you see
[2:31:12] they W because why you can read one
[2:31:15] another's
[2:31:18] when you see yourself forcing
[2:31:20] yourself stay
[2:31:22] away Adam did not
[2:31:26] for she already knew let me also say
[2:31:30] this many times women know
[2:31:36] before you know who your husband
[2:31:40] is before he talks to

[2:34:46] it was not the truth actually in my
[2:34:49] heart
[2:34:50] something what am I trying to say and
[2:34:53] these people end up getting
[2:34:55] married and they have made married well
[2:34:57] ever
[2:34:59] since I believe they have been
[2:35:04] complimenting they didn't say Amen Peter
[2:35:06] didn't say
[2:35:09] Amen but here is the
[2:35:11] point
[2:35:14] why the woman
[2:35:16] had already seen
[2:35:19] husband and the man no matter how far he
[2:35:22] would
[2:35:23] run he could not run
[2:35:26] out I feel to say
[2:35:29] this if you go in prayer and God chose
[2:35:33] you who your husband
[2:35:34] is believe for it pray for IT stand your
[2:35:39] ground don't tell
[2:35:42] anyone if you tell anybody you will
[2:35:45] spoil the whole thing
[2:35:47] God will say okay
[2:35:48] now there are some people who dream
[2:35:50] dreams and they want to make them
[2:35:54] happen they want to make the dreams
[2:35:57] happen this is what I saw it must
[2:36:00] happen if God showed it will bring it
[2:36:04] to he says write down the
[2:36:07] vision it
[2:36:09] may will surely
[2:36:11] come sister if God shows you
[2:36:14] your for
[2:36:17] it for him and wait upon
[2:36:22] God are you hearing me now and and and
[2:36:26] and sister Eve woman
[2:36:28] saw and waited and Adam came up and said
[2:36:33] you are BN of my B my woman
[2:36:39] just molded you know she just mended in
[2:36:43] that
[2:36:44] song
[2:36:46] Bor of my
[2:36:47] B Flesh of
[2:36:50] My you be called a woman
[2:36:53] Hallelujah and then
[2:36:57] just marage should not be
[2:37:00] difficult should be
[2:37:03] easy but you approach it the wrong
[2:37:08] way are you hearing me
[2:37:14] now don't approach it the wrong
[2:37:18] way approach it
[2:37:21] prayerfully brother if you want to get
[2:37:24] married don't begin looking around and
[2:37:26] shopping around and going from church to
[2:37:31] church go to the church and lo yourself
[2:37:33] in go some other place some room go some
[2:37:37] go begin praying oh
[2:37:40] God yes you going to Mar in two years no
[2:37:44] problem veeve to me open my eyes show me
[2:37:48] my
[2:37:51] me you praying people are saying what is
[2:37:54] wrong are you going to Mar this year no
[2:37:57] but I'm praying for my Mir to come I'm
[2:38:00] believing for it to happen it begins
[2:38:03] with
[2:38:04] prayer if you do not pray there are 99%
[2:38:08] chances you'll make a wrong
[2:38:10] [Music]
[2:38:12] mistake you will make a wrong choice
[2:38:16] and if you pray and you don't follow
[2:38:18] what God is telling
[2:38:20] you the chances are you will make a
[2:38:24] wrong all right that brings us to the
[2:38:26] second stage
[2:38:28] now how many have understood the prayer
[2:38:33] part pray and when you see her don't
[2:38:37] just go and grab
[2:38:38] her do it prayerfully
[2:38:40] also for it do it with
[2:38:44] cel now when it comes to
[2:38:48] courtship this is the major
[2:38:52] partner the many mistakes are done
[2:38:55] here in this area and I want to deal
[2:38:58] with it
[2:39:00] today we can help our young people now
[2:39:03] now there is no right or wrong way of
[2:39:05] starting
[2:39:07] [Music]
[2:39:10] courtship different pastors will tell
[2:39:12] you different
[2:39:14] approaches so in Zimbabwe they do it a
[2:39:16] little bit
[2:39:18] differently I I saw that some church
[2:39:21] they announce even courtship in the
[2:39:25] church no courtship not engagement
[2:39:33] courtship like I said different
[2:39:35] countries different churches different
[2:39:36] pastors have different
[2:39:40] approaches so it really basically comes
[2:39:42] down to your parents preference or your
[2:39:44] pastor's teach apprach
[2:39:50] it depends on the way that works for
[2:39:53] them as per their
[2:39:59] experience like every
[2:40:02] Church understand what I'm saying every
[2:40:04] church has their own
[2:40:07] experiences that things have examples of
[2:40:10] things that have happened in their
[2:40:14] Church decision
[2:40:17] on how matters should be
[2:40:21] handled you're following me
[2:40:24] right now but there are certain facts
[2:40:27] that we should know
[2:40:30] how the parents according to the
[2:40:34] Bible can annal your
[2:40:39] vow that's what the Bible teaches we'll
[2:40:41] get to that
[2:40:42] shortly H numbers 30
[2:40:47] vers three let us first get that
[2:40:52] done if a woman also vow a vow unto the
[2:40:55] Lord and bind herself by a bond being in
[2:40:58] her father's house in her Youth and her
[2:41:00] father hear her vow and her Bor
[2:41:02] wherewith she has bound her soul and her
[2:41:05] father shall hold his peace at her then
[2:41:08] all her vows shall stand and every Bond
[2:41:10] wherewith she has bound her soul shall
[2:41:13] stand but if a father disallow her in
[2:41:15] the day that he heareth not any of her
[2:41:19] vows or her bones wherewith she has
[2:41:21] bound her soul shall stand and the Lord
[2:41:24] shall forgive her because her father
[2:41:25] disallowed
[2:41:33] [Music]
[2:41:44] her
[2:41:53] [Music]
[2:42:14] fore
[2:42:19] so now your your father has a very big
[2:42:21] authority over
[2:42:25] you so and um if your father does have
[2:42:30] such
[2:42:32] Authority how much more your
[2:42:36] spiritual on
[2:42:38] Earth your father your pastor how much
[2:42:43] more they have a lot of authority over
[2:42:47] you the Bible says here if the girl is
[2:42:49] still living in her father's
[2:42:52] house basically means under her father's
[2:42:55] um you know umbrella or or you know
[2:42:59] stewardship and the girl makes a
[2:43:04] vow any vow including a marriage vow
[2:43:09] then the the the if the father hears of
[2:43:12] it and he doesn't say anything
[2:43:16] it's all right the girl will be bound to
[2:43:21] that but if the father hears of it and
[2:43:25] he disallows
[2:43:26] it then the girl will be free from
[2:43:31] all so when you go and you talk to a
[2:43:35] sister and her father is not aware her
[2:43:39] pastor is not
[2:43:40] a and she you know engages with you like
[2:43:44] that
[2:43:47] the father has a
[2:43:49] right to say you will not marry my
[2:43:54] daughter you not Mar and by law you
[2:43:57] cannot actually marry
[2:43:59] her if her father
[2:44:02] dis so then what's the approach to
[2:44:07] court first of all courtship is not
[2:44:13] dating people tell each
[2:44:16] other is
[2:44:23] not courtship is not
[2:44:26] dating dating and courtship is like the
[2:44:30] same
[2:44:32] thing but dating is used in in a secular
[2:44:38] way it's the same
[2:44:40] thing is
[2:44:44] called
[2:44:46] but in the world when you are dating
[2:44:51] somebody you can go and visit their
[2:44:55] house right and spend a few
[2:45:00] nights or a few
[2:45:02] months and then you go back home or at
[2:45:05] the hostel where you are
[2:45:07] staying and you know he's buying you
[2:45:10] Pizza he's buying you this you meet
[2:45:13] everywhere you want to go whatever
[2:45:17] and you're waiting for the day he
[2:45:22] propos right so you live
[2:45:26] imally and after a long
[2:45:28] time the young man goes to somebody
[2:45:32] else deceived me he did this to me he
[2:45:35] did that to me that's the way of the
[2:45:38] world and we do not believe in dating
[2:45:40] like
[2:45:42] that we believe in cour
[2:45:46] a with the intention of
[2:45:49] [Music]
[2:45:51] marriage we don't believe in how is it
[2:45:55] called
[2:45:56] [Music]
[2:46:00] chatting is it also called
[2:46:02] slaying on the phone how is it called
[2:46:07] flatting flatting how many understand
[2:46:12] flatting you all looking at me as if you
[2:46:14] don't know I'm talking
[2:46:16] about may God forgive you flatting on
[2:46:20] the
[2:46:21] phone I love you you dare not say that
[2:46:25] to someone's
[2:46:27] daughter don't use such
[2:46:30] words someone you're not going to get
[2:46:32] married
[2:46:34] to I love you you don't know what the
[2:46:37] moment brother the moment say
[2:46:40] that s
[2:46:44] energy
[2:46:45] to this girl's
[2:46:47] house and she feels she's your
[2:46:51] property and now you come and say I'm
[2:46:54] not and those are the mistakes that have
[2:46:56] been
[2:46:57] done and we want we don't want those
[2:47:00] things to
[2:47:01] continue don't flat on
[2:47:03] phone that's why I don't believe that
[2:47:05] you have no business getting in
[2:47:09] touch you have no business getting in
[2:47:12] touch and I believe every parent has a
[2:47:14] right
[2:47:16] to know who your children are speaking
[2:47:18] [Music]
[2:47:20] to mothers fathers are you
[2:47:22] hearing well if your children are still
[2:47:25] young just know it from today you have a
[2:47:29] right to
[2:47:30] know who is your daughter speaking
[2:47:33] to because you're not going to go
[2:47:35] legalist
[2:47:37] way no
[2:47:38] phones well then if you say no phon you
[2:47:41] should get a
[2:47:43] phone get to know who is she talking
[2:47:48] to Hallelujah and all my children
[2:47:51] including the big boys they know this
[2:47:54] very well I search their
[2:47:58] phones who are you talking
[2:48:02] to even the big man like
[2:48:06] brother have taken his phone who who is
[2:48:10] that one I do it as long as I'm you're
[2:48:14] like
[2:48:16] parent I will do it as long as you are
[2:48:19] in my roof under my roof under my
[2:48:22] responsibility I will do
[2:48:24] it are you hearing parents you ought to
[2:48:28] do
[2:48:30] that get to know who they are
[2:48:35] talking well then you can be able to
[2:48:37] guide
[2:48:42] them now courtship
[2:48:46] is a time that a girl and a boy get to
[2:48:49] know each
[2:48:51] other this is the time the two families
[2:48:54] get
[2:48:56] born this is all approached
[2:49:01] advisably and in the fear of
[2:49:05] God all right so now that's why I said
[2:49:08] it's not this kind of of chitchat and
[2:49:10] they fling
[2:49:11] around your parents don't know that her
[2:49:14] parents don't
[2:49:15] doesn't know youres
[2:49:16] know so what is it that you're
[2:49:19] doing she's my friend he's my friend no
[2:49:22] I don't believe in that kind of
[2:49:24] friend I believe if someone is your
[2:49:26] friend they friend for a
[2:49:29] reason they are your friend because
[2:49:31] you're doing business with
[2:49:33] them they your friend now we have these
[2:49:36] groups some of you are sisters managing
[2:49:38] this
[2:49:39] group and you sending messages to
[2:49:42] Brothers brothers are sending to sisters
[2:49:45] that's all it is
[2:49:48] about like these sisters where is the
[2:49:50] sister Fe and other
[2:49:52] sisters who who were receiving
[2:49:55] people we are not saying oh cover
[2:50:02] your we put
[2:50:04] sisters to receive
[2:50:06] brothers sisters as
[2:50:08] well but these sisters got a lot of
[2:50:10] issues
[2:50:12] there a brother arrives and smiling they
[2:50:17] told him you should smile brother you're
[2:50:20] welcome now by the time the
[2:50:24] brother sister smiled very
[2:50:27] well comes back again sister can I have

[2:50:34] because the sister is trained

[2:50:39] contact for what reason do you
[2:50:42] give maybe let me give the brother the
[2:50:44] contact because maybe he wants me to you
[2:50:47] have already finished your
[2:50:49] work you have already finished your work
[2:50:52] don't need to give the
[2:50:53] cont and here you know you are doing the
[2:50:56] group things and then you write a
[2:50:59] brother brother have you sent
[2:51:02] your your weekly contribution oh yes I
[2:51:05] have okay okay sister God bless you amen
[2:51:10] how are you fine oh sister I like your
[2:51:13] eyes
[2:51:16] you should be able to
[2:51:18] design there is a wrong Spirit
[2:51:21] here and if you have a spirit of Jesus
[2:51:23] Christ it is not hard to design these
[2:51:28] things number one goship now you see the
[2:51:33] god brother you see the
[2:51:36] God no one sees the
[2:51:38] God after you see the god you're not
[2:51:42] 100% sure I've heard something oh you
[2:51:45] 100% sure that's when you go to the
[2:51:48] pastor not sure the matter is still in
[2:51:52] prayer you need
[2:51:54] Cel come to the
[2:51:56] pastor I've been seeing
[2:51:59] this first question I will ask you have
[2:52:02] you contacted
[2:52:03] her be honest if you have be honest
[2:52:08] about I've seen young people who come no
[2:52:11] nothing and this have been talking for
[2:52:13] three four months
[2:52:16] the moment that happens be rest assured
[2:52:20] all the I'm going to give
[2:52:21] you is now
[2:52:24] unid it will not help you because you
[2:52:27] it's best on a
[2:52:29] life if you go to a doctor and you tell
[2:52:32] him doctor I I have a problem what's the
[2:52:36] problem my problem is ABC you do not
[2:52:39] tell the whole
[2:52:40] truth thect will not diagn
[2:52:43] you
[2:52:45] you have to say the truth you have to be
[2:52:48] honest you have to be a real
[2:52:50] gentle the Bible says in Proverbs 15
[2:52:52] without Cel purposes are
[2:52:58] disappointed so you see you need Cel the
[2:53:02] moment you see before you even talk to
[2:53:04] her go to your pastor meet him and then
[2:53:09] receive
[2:53:10] councel now as your as the councel you
[2:53:13] have received
[2:53:15] you will then initiate contact with the
[2:53:19] God praise the name of the Lord usually
[2:53:22] it depends on that's why I'm saying as
[2:53:24] per the coun because you there are many
[2:53:28] scenarios there are scenarios where you
[2:53:30] may want to first visit the parents or
[2:53:32] talk to the
[2:53:34] parents there are scenarios where you
[2:53:37] may just want to contact the
[2:53:39] car there are scenarios where you may
[2:53:41] have to go through
[2:53:42] somebody it depends
[2:53:45] there is no one siiz fit
[2:53:47] all so seek for
[2:53:50] councel if you don't seek for councel
[2:53:53] you're going to see a sister and then
[2:53:55] you will tell the brother friend of
[2:53:57] yours you know I like that sister and I
[2:54:00] she's your friend please go
[2:54:03] to it has happened many times and when
[2:54:07] this when he reaches
[2:54:10] there he will say brother sister God
[2:54:14] bless
[2:54:15] you he how can I tell talk about the
[2:54:19] brother
[2:54:21] sing No No but sister you have been
[2:54:25] looking at you for a while you don't
[2:54:27] know what is in another brother's
[2:54:30] heart on
[2:54:32] your many people have married
[2:54:35] like when they go talk on of
[2:54:38] other they end up talking about
[2:54:42] themselves by the time you brother what
[2:54:45] Happ what
[2:54:47] came the sister said she loves
[2:54:50] me but is the one who did
[2:54:53] [Music]
[2:54:54] everything so as the coun contact
[2:54:59] the and a decision remember is not yet
[2:55:06] met by this time you met the pastor you
[2:55:10] prayed about it you seen the GU maybe
[2:55:13] you have contacted the guy
[2:55:15] our decision is not yet
[2:55:17] made it's not it doesn't mean now you're
[2:55:20] going to
[2:55:21] marry this is godship you getting to
[2:55:24] know who the person
[2:55:26] is so it's not a m that you Mar you're
[2:55:30] just getting to know each
[2:55:32] other right and and many of these
[2:55:36] fail and others work out so that's why
[2:55:40] in this church I contined to insist it
[2:55:44] should be a secret affair at that
[2:55:49] stage I've actually spoken to the young
[2:55:52] man you like that
[2:55:54] system how many of you
[2:55:58] told no
[2:56:03] one people will be there you don't know
[2:56:05] what is
[2:56:06] going and then by the time you know are
[2:56:10] in the late
[2:56:11] stag because why
[2:56:14] reasons in many of these
[2:56:18] circumstances you find
[2:56:20] that this young
[2:56:22] lady she's talking to this
[2:56:25] brother let us say that this brother has
[2:56:28] come to the
[2:56:29] pastor but this
[2:56:32] sister is liking this
[2:56:35] brother but this brother is not yet
[2:56:38] earning good
[2:56:40] money and then while the sister is
[2:56:42] talking to this brother
[2:56:46] brother
[2:56:48] comes brother is looking to the
[2:56:52] sister
[2:56:54] brother driving a very
[2:56:57] beauti and also talk to
[2:57:00] the without going through the
[2:57:04] pister putting
[2:57:09] his and now the sister
[2:57:11] begins going to accept Brother D
[2:57:15] but brother Dan has no
[2:57:17] money now brother
[2:57:21] is oh God help me then she also goes to
[2:57:25] her
[2:57:26] friends I have two boyfriend help me one
[2:57:30] is another is
[2:57:33] poor but he's very
[2:57:37] good no
[2:57:39] money what can
[2:57:41] I and then the sister the friends also
[2:57:45] ad
[2:57:47] jealous because they want the other
[2:57:50] brother understand IDE they will all
[2:57:53] have double
[2:57:55] standards that's why I said this The
[2:57:57] Secret
[2:57:58] of sisters don't accept a brother to
[2:58:01] cour you if they don't have the
[2:58:06] license he comes this you find one
[2:58:10] sister having 10
[2:58:12] contacts
[2:58:14] Brothers this one I'm not sure this one
[2:58:18] has some money this one
[2:58:22] has this one is from my rich family this
[2:58:25] one is very
[2:58:27] spiritual this one has
[2:58:29] everything but it's not spiritual this
[2:58:32] one now the sister is there she comes in
[2:58:35] church you think you are
[2:58:38] worshiping but she's looking at
[2:58:41] everyone brother brother
[2:58:48] around for the Lord you know have this
[2:58:51] song we usually sing you know is all
[2:58:55] over me she's doing
[2:59:05] that and she's
[2:59:08] imagining that you can't even

[3:02:44] Time depending on the
[3:02:48] couple and the
[3:02:50] circumstances give them a
[3:02:55] timeline make a decision this given much
[3:02:58] perod of time and uh and after which if
[3:03:02] a decision has not been
[3:03:05] made and you are not too sure about each
[3:03:09] other it's just better you cut off the
[3:03:12] relation
[3:03:14] praise the Lord so that other
[3:03:17] brothers can also take their
[3:03:21] chances no need to advertise you are

[3:04:11] other young people from going there
[3:04:15] they're
[3:04:19] anxious may go there and if he talk to
[3:04:24] sister may

[3:04:30] go so that he will watch
[3:04:33] out no need
[3:04:36] to if everybody no let them
[3:04:39] go if the sister receives
[3:04:42] them that she's of a bad character

[3:05:50] them support them if they told you what
[3:05:54] would you have
[3:05:56] done nothing you not we you were not
[3:05:59] needed at that
[3:06:01] time are you hearing me now goship ends
[3:06:06] in a
[3:06:09] decision ends in a
[3:06:12] choice
[3:06:13] courtship is the big deal here and I
[3:06:14] want to deal with it then I'll just
[3:06:16] finish the
[3:06:18] others so now courtship after I've
[3:06:21] showed you now how you approach
[3:06:25] it you know parents are
[3:06:27] involved pastors are
[3:06:29] involv you know and you two are involved
[3:06:33] you begin talking to one another you
[3:06:35] begin talking to one another and and if
[3:06:37] it works out praise the Lord then it
[3:06:40] must end in a
[3:06:42] decision
[3:06:44] choice and here is what a prophet says
[3:06:46] in the message the CH
[3:06:49] of please listen
[3:06:51] carefully so you must make the right
[3:06:55] choice again the kind of woman that a
[3:06:57] man would
[3:06:59] choose will reflect his
[3:07:03] Ambitions and his
[3:07:05] character say
[3:07:08] Amen the woman you choose she will
[3:07:11] reflect your ambition
[3:07:16] if you're a bad man you will choose a
[3:07:18] bad woman if you're a good man you
[3:07:21] cannot choose a bad woman because it is
[3:07:24] your character that will choose
[3:07:27] her if a man chooses the wrong
[3:07:31] woman it reflects his
[3:07:33] character and what he ties himself
[3:07:37] to it shows truly what is in
[3:07:40] him a woman reflects what is in the man
[3:07:43] when he chooses half a
[3:07:48] wife shows what is down in
[3:07:52] him no matter what he says
[3:07:56] outside watch what he
[3:07:59] [Applause]
[3:08:02] Mar no matter what I come here and
[3:08:06] say matter what I preach look at my wife
[3:08:11] you will know what kind of a man I am
[3:08:15] if my wife doesn't come to church if my
[3:08:17] wife doesn't pray if my wife doesn't
[3:08:20] raise the
[3:08:21] children
[3:08:28] sheing he it shows what kind of man I
[3:08:33] am no matter what I
[3:08:35] say so the man chooses a woman that is a
[3:08:40] reflection of his
[3:08:42] character
[3:08:44] I got to a man's office and he says he's
[3:08:46] a
[3:08:49] Christian all around the
[3:08:52] world that old boyie music going
[3:08:56] on I don't care what he say I don't
[3:08:59] believe his testimony because his spirit
[3:09:02] is feeding on them
[3:09:05] things what say if you would marry a
[3:09:08] chorus
[3:09:10] girl or if you would marry a sex
[3:09:21] it
[3:09:22] reflects it shows what he has in his
[3:09:26] mind of what his future home is going to
[3:09:31] be because he taken this woman to raise
[3:09:34] his children
[3:09:37] back the woman you choose will raise
[3:09:40] your children according to her character
[3:09:46] if you want a prayerful
[3:09:48] family choose a prayerful
[3:09:51] gu don't say I will change her later
[3:09:54] there's a problem there she cannot
[3:09:57] change
[3:09:58] later the way you choose her is the way
[3:10:00] she will
[3:10:01] remain she's not filled the Holy Ghost
[3:10:05] she won't have the Holy Ghost and she
[3:10:07] won't have anything to impact upon your
[3:10:10] children you see it reflects he shows
[3:10:13] what he has in his
[3:10:16] mind of what his future home is going to
[3:10:20] be because you've taken that woman to
[3:10:22] raise children
[3:10:25] by of all of us what we
[3:10:28] are is our mother's responsibility our
[3:10:30] mother's
[3:10:32] duty how many can say 100% that's
[3:10:36] corre you are what you are because of
[3:10:38] your
[3:10:41] mother
[3:10:43] thank God for my mother right
[3:10:45] here I remember
[3:10:48] vividly from the time I was a baby I
[3:10:52] think when I remember maybe five six
[3:10:54] years I remember everything how she used
[3:10:57] to pray sometimes you playing in house
[3:11:01] and then you bump into a bedroom and you
[3:11:04] find down on her knees praying praying
[3:11:07] and she was even
[3:11:09] Anglican praying praying so that was
[3:11:13] raising
[3:11:14] us until we would find out praying and
[3:11:18] then you humble yourself also until you
[3:11:20] get tired and sneak
[3:11:23] away because you you are learning now
[3:11:26] she doesn't teach her children by what
[3:11:28] she
[3:11:30] knows she teaches your children by what
[3:11:33] she
[3:11:36] is if her mouth is
[3:11:39] filthy the mouth of your children will
[3:11:40] be
[3:11:41] filthy if she dresses well her children
[3:11:45] will dress well you see these girls
[3:11:48] dressing skimpy
[3:11:49] SC
[3:11:51] us watch their
[3:11:54] parents their mothers they doing the
[3:11:57] same same
[3:11:58] things so the woman you choose
[3:12:01] brother her character will reflect in
[3:12:04] your
[3:12:05] children so if you want a God-fearing
[3:12:09] family a spiritual
[3:12:11] woman
[3:12:17] and whatever she is that's the way she
[3:12:19] will raise those
[3:12:22] children it reflects what is in the
[3:12:25] man a man takes a woman like
[3:12:28] that he CHS just what he's thinking of
[3:12:30] the
[3:12:33] future okay let me finish up this listen
[3:12:36] could you imagine a Christian doing a
[3:12:38] thing like
[3:12:40] that no sir I could not a true Christian
[3:12:44] will not look for such beauty
[3:12:55] queens
[3:13:02] seens Look for
[3:13:06] Christian now you can't have all
[3:13:10] things there might be one God really
[3:13:14] pretty the other girl maybe she's her St
[3:13:17] looks better than this
[3:13:20] one and you might have to sacrifice one
[3:13:23] for the
[3:13:27] other you hearing me but if she's not
[3:13:31] the St of a
[3:13:33] lady or a woman if she's not the St of a
[3:13:37] woman or yeah he says I don't care
[3:13:39] whether she's pretty or
[3:13:41] not
[3:13:43] you better look at her
[3:13:47] character whether she's pretty or not
[3:13:50] pretty you may be looking for
[3:13:56] Slender the one who can model you
[3:13:59] already imagining how you're going to
[3:14:03] live you are just
[3:14:05] imagining it's not
[3:14:07] true don't be
[3:14:10] selfish when you choose a wife
[3:14:13] you not choosing a wife you're choosing
[3:14:16] a
[3:14:17] mother to your
[3:14:21] children you're very busy thinking when
[3:14:23] I choose this one I can
[3:14:30] even but now when I choose this how can
[3:14:33] I car
[3:14:35] her I will not that you have a
[3:14:41] problemer
[3:14:43] that's not what it should Bas
[3:14:45] on Bas on Christian
[3:14:49] character let me put
[3:14:52] this look for character it doesn't
[3:14:55] matter she may be 200
[3:14:59] kg choose
[3:15:01] character if she can raise your
[3:15:04] children and bring a
[3:15:11] generation
[3:15:14] now it is becoming if a Christian would
[3:15:17] choose a
[3:15:19] wife he ought to choose a
[3:15:22] genuine Born Again
[3:15:28] woman regardless of what she looks
[3:15:34] like I don't need this very big
[3:15:38] cheeks may God have mercy on you are
[3:15:41] your cheeks small
[3:15:46] if I
[3:15:49] choose I need a long
[3:15:51] nose this nose is like it is very
[3:15:57] flat you think the nose will take you to
[3:16:00] heaven
[3:16:02] Hallelujah regardless of what she looks
[3:16:04] like it is what she
[3:16:08] is God help me you understand it if you
[3:16:13] understand it I will finish what makes
[3:16:15] her and then again that reflects his own
[3:16:19] Godly
[3:16:22] character and reflect what is in his
[3:16:25] mind what is going to be in the
[3:16:30] future for his family will be raised by
[3:16:35] such a
[3:16:38] woman for the future
[3:16:41] plans of his home if he marries one of
[3:16:45] these
[3:16:48] little sex queens and
[3:16:51] what what kind of a home could a man
[3:16:53] expect to
[3:16:56] have if he marries a girl that ain't got
[3:16:59] enough moral about her to stay
[3:17:05] home and take care of a
[3:17:07] house and want to work out in somebody's
[3:17:11] office
[3:17:12] what kind of a housekeeper would she
[3:17:15] be you will have babysitters and
[3:17:17] everything
[3:17:20] else and the prophet says now I am not
[3:17:23] much of this modernistic
[3:17:27] test women working when I seen these
[3:17:30] women with these Uniforms
[3:17:33] on riding around in the
[3:17:36] city
[3:17:38] motorcycles as police it is a disgrace
[3:17:43] C that let a woman do
[3:17:47] that to say Amen to this as many men
[3:17:51] without
[3:17:53] work it shows the modern thinking of our
[3:17:56] city show
[3:18:01] degrading we don't have them women we
[3:18:04] don't have to have them women out like
[3:18:09] that they ain't got no business out they
[3:18:12] like
[3:18:14] that when God gave a man a
[3:18:18] wife he gave him the best thing he could
[3:18:22] give outside
[3:18:28] ofation but when a woman goes to take A
[3:18:31] Woman's
[3:18:34] Place she about the worst thing I could
[3:18:37] ever get a hold
[3:18:40] of now
[3:18:42] Pastor are you saying women should not
[3:18:46] work our sisters here
[3:18:48] work we believe women should
[3:18:52] work and uh but what what the prophet is
[3:18:55] trying to say here is actually what we
[3:18:57] see actually this was 19
[3:19:03] 665 but it has gone even much
[3:19:05] worse you find women that say they have
[3:19:09] a
[3:19:11] career
[3:19:13] they're career
[3:19:15] minded they don't care about their
[3:19:17] family they care about their
[3:19:19] career to the extent many of them have
[3:19:23] convinced
[3:19:25] themselves they are um what is this kind
[3:19:28] of thing they
[3:19:30] they they are equal to
[3:19:34] man what is this called somebody help me
[3:19:36] throw the word to
[3:19:41] me
[3:19:42] feminine are they called
[3:19:45] feminine
[3:19:47] feminists the word feminist they believe
[3:19:51] everything a man can do I can
[3:19:53] do everywhere a man can work I can
[3:19:56] work I am equal to
[3:19:59] a should recognize me I am strong and
[3:20:03] not
[3:20:04] weak like that whereby they have taken
[3:20:07] their
[3:20:08] position taken it away from the world
[3:20:12] I am not here to preach to you what you
[3:20:14] want to
[3:20:16] hear I'm preaching to you what the word
[3:20:18] of God
[3:20:21] says and whether you don't like you like
[3:20:23] it you don't like the word of God never
[3:20:26] grows
[3:20:27] old same from AG to
[3:20:30] age societies will
[3:20:35] change will change but the word of God
[3:20:38] never
[3:20:39] changes and a place in a home
[3:20:42] is for the woman to take care of her
[3:20:45] family and raise the children in the
[3:20:48] fear of the Lord well where has help her
[3:20:52] husband as as your husband
[3:20:55] agrees you can go and work and
[3:20:58] help but where your husband doesn't
[3:21:00] agree for you to go and
[3:21:02] work well then he must be able to
[3:21:04] provide for everyone
[3:21:06] of for the Bible says if a man can't
[3:21:09] take care of his home
[3:21:13] worse than an
[3:21:15] INF help us a man must be able to work
[3:21:18] and take care of his
[3:21:21] home cherish his wife provide for his
[3:21:25] wife that's what the Bible
[3:21:29] says and that is the way
[3:21:33] of a choice has to be made in some other
[3:21:36] place it says a decision must be
[3:21:39] made you have to make a decision sister
[3:21:42] even you sister you must make a decision
[3:21:46] whether you want to go with this or
[3:21:48] not if you make a wrong
[3:21:51] decision knowing it is
[3:21:54] wrong then it's not up to God it's up to
[3:21:58] you you will have a wrong comp
[3:22:01] companion the rest of your life and
[3:22:04] there's nothing anybody can do about
[3:22:07] it the word of God does not allow you to
[3:22:10] Remar so then you must make your
[3:22:13] decision
[3:22:15] soberly spiritually prayerfully
[3:22:19] advisably waiting upon God and then you
[3:22:22] make the choice and when you make the
[3:22:25] choice she's the one sister you also
[3:22:28] have a
[3:22:33] choice you make your choice will you go
[3:22:38] if yes it is
[3:22:40] sealed that will bring us to the third
[3:22:42] stage
[3:22:44] now
[3:22:46] engagement and I'm not going to delay on
[3:22:48] this read a little portion for you and
[3:22:51] then after decision is
[3:22:53] made that you
[3:22:55] are then comes the
[3:22:58] engagement that you find at
[3:23:01] [Music]
[3:23:02] Al you've got to make an engagement
[3:23:04] before this Union can
[3:23:10] be and you see that's what we always do
[3:23:13] here they've really
[3:23:16] accepted a decision has been made she
[3:23:19] has already said yes so we come here in
[3:23:22] the church to make an official
[3:23:26] engagement by the time we announce it
[3:23:29] here not turning
[3:23:31] back and and he

[3:23:44] 1964 says as long as they take that
[3:23:47] vow they are
[3:23:50] mared just like a boy if a boy promises
[3:23:52] a girl to marry her under good
[3:23:59] faith he's obligated to that
[3:24:03] gu he's just as good as
[3:24:07] mared the only thing that the Lord
[3:24:10] does the Lord
[3:24:13] does is to give you a bill of right to
[3:24:15] live
[3:24:17] together to keep from being common
[3:24:19] husband and
[3:24:23] wife but when a man tells a
[3:24:26] woman I will
[3:24:28] marry honey I'll marry I'll take you for
[3:24:31] my
[3:24:32] wife you had you had the words that
[3:24:34] shame was
[3:24:36] speaking when you get to those
[3:24:39] words you married
[3:24:42] your V is
[3:24:45] sacred that's what marries you
[3:24:47] and there is not a preacher can marry
[3:24:51] you no
[3:24:53] magistrate or nothing else it is your
[3:24:55] own
[3:24:57] vow to God and to this man when you
[3:25:02] promise when you promise you are
[3:25:07] married now if shame comes up or favor
[3:25:10] comes up now and say
[3:25:13] we've changed our
[3:25:14] mind well I just tell them suit
[3:25:18] yourselves as far as I'm concerned your
[3:25:22] marri and by the time we announce the
[3:25:27] engagement as this
[3:25:29] church we decided after past
[3:25:34] experiences will no longer announce
[3:25:39] engagements before getting the is
[3:25:44] approv and how do we do that
[3:25:46] traditionally here there is what we call
[3:25:49] a
[3:25:51] previsit and when that is
[3:25:54] done of course when the choices are made
[3:25:56] decisions are made after period
[3:26:01] of two months three
[3:26:03] months you've met that time of C you
[3:26:06] know one
[3:26:07] another what are you talking during that
[3:26:09] time really to know one
[3:26:12] another what are your priorities in life
[3:26:15] what are my priorities are they
[3:26:18] compatible what about your family what
[3:26:20] about my family are we compatible you
[3:26:23] know your brothers your sisters are we
[3:26:26] compatible can we make a home in this
[3:26:30] atmosphere if it is a yes then now you
[3:26:33] go to do a
[3:26:34] previsit when you do
[3:26:36] a the parents
[3:26:40] approve it's like the the parents have
[3:26:41] said you can now
[3:26:44] call you can we officially recognize
[3:26:48] you many times they tell us here in
[3:26:50] Africa well you can go and bring us this
[3:26:55] match then you will Mar
[3:26:58] our after that you can come here
[3:27:02] publicly announce your
[3:27:04] [Music]
[3:27:06] engagement pending the finishing of your
[3:27:10] maress
[3:27:13] which then comes the
[3:27:17] introduction and then the
[3:27:19] ceremony the ceremony doesn't have to be
[3:27:22] huge we have this
[3:27:25] mentality marriage
[3:27:27] is marriage needs money Mar does not
[3:27:30] need
[3:27:31] money marriage needs a man with a life
[3:27:34] of
[3:27:37] purpose number two who
[3:27:40] income B income that can take care
[3:27:44] himself and the
[3:27:46] wife and that's all it takes as you
[3:27:49] right in God that's all you
[3:27:53] need the rest you work it
[3:27:56] together you work for it together two
[3:28:00] are better than
[3:28:01] one she doesn't come to live in a be
[3:28:04] environment she comes to help you build
[3:28:05] your
[3:28:09] environment are you are you F me church
[3:28:12] that's what marriage is you come
[3:28:14] together to
[3:28:15] build when I when I got married with my
[3:28:18] wife we literally
[3:28:23] had people
[3:28:26] who but where are they today but God has
[3:28:29] given us
[3:28:30] Grace actually yesterday we were
[3:28:32] celebrating our first daughter's 10th
[3:28:37] birthday but the the great
[3:28:40] talkers who talked
[3:28:42] against we can't even find them
[3:28:45] any but we are still here so don't
[3:28:48] listen to the people who are
[3:28:50] talking many of them who are talking
[3:28:52] they're talking because they're coming
[3:28:54] from defeated scenarios in the
[3:28:58] past faed
[3:29:00] marriages faed
[3:29:01] relationship there's a woman I heard
[3:29:06] [Music]
[3:29:07] say men are beast don't follow such
[3:29:10] words
[3:29:12] words come from broken
[3:29:17] hearts are not don't follow such words
[3:29:21] follow the word of God the word of God
[3:29:24] says if you find a
[3:29:26] wife
[3:29:27] good you favor from the
[3:29:31] Lord I'm glad shame found
[3:29:36] favor and when he got favor from the
[3:29:38] Lord he got
[3:29:40] favor
[3:29:45] and then after and then
[3:29:47] lastly comes the
[3:29:49] wedding this is where the promises are
[3:29:54] made the promises here is where you make
[3:29:56] promises to one
[3:29:59] another actually someone told me where
[3:30:02] do those promises
[3:30:04] come well you can write your
[3:30:07] own and tell me Pastor these are the
[3:30:10] promises
[3:30:12] no problem as long as they agree with
[3:30:15] the
[3:30:16] word then you will we will give those
[3:30:19] promises and you know it says that those
[3:30:21] promises have to be made to one
[3:30:24] another like that you make the promise
[3:30:27] sweetheart if you marry
[3:30:29] me I promise that I'll be loyal and
[3:30:33] true I I will look upon no other
[3:30:37] woman I look upon no other
[3:30:40] man that as a duty as a
[3:30:45] wife children I will do as a duty as a
[3:30:50] mother
[3:30:53] housekeeper all these promises has to be
[3:30:56] man should be made in a correct
[3:31:01] way now when you make these promises it
[3:31:04] doesn't have to be in a big
[3:31:08] wedding it can be five people
[3:31:12] can be 10 according to your
[3:31:15] income and your available
[3:31:19] resources we are not going to stress our
[3:31:21] young
[3:31:23] people you don't have to make a big
[3:31:27] wedding if brother Dan is going to make
[3:31:29] a
[3:31:31] wedding and and he invites his
[3:31:34] friends
[3:31:36] people don't kill him brother you are
[3:31:39] very
[3:31:42] if you give him the money he will make
[3:31:43] the one for
[3:31:47] 100 but if he if you have no money you
[3:31:50] can even come here like this on
[3:31:53] Su and
[3:31:55] you and you go back home no
[3:32:00] stress no
[3:32:02] stress so these things are supposed to
