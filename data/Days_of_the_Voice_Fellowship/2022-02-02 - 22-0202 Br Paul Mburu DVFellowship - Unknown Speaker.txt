shout the candy cane yes i can die but i cannot fail [Music] and if you hallelujah i mean let's go back to the book of deuteronomy uh chapter one just dragons again i want to appreciate you my community for this father to brought us [Applause] to caesar singing about your love of father that we so desire can fill our hearts imagine and to make us to be able soldiers in the army of the lord just surrender ourselves to you now as we just welcome your holy spirit to continue further ministering to us even through your word now and that as we listen as your children father receive those who have even had their own journeys bless them and baby with them again together we surrender to your will jesus name and the lord had the voice of your words and was wrath and swear saying surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land which i swear to give unto your fathers he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he has trodden upon and to his children because he has wholly followed the lord lord made it possible that we can be here for this period of time to say that you know it has been in my heart for quite some time been communicating with brothers here and if amen you know when when people are somewhere where something is being established they also want to associate themselves in that place so that if there are 30 years to come people always want some name some good names so i'll write somewhere here i'm going to write paul was here that people write somewhere so that they can be associated with that place establishing his kingdom in different and me personally i'm french i'm friends with churches that go for outreach real child that expresses life can you say yeah daddy you're so good i'm a man i mean i i wouldn't want to talk anything doctrinal on that son but i think if i was in a church that does not believe in outreach i would consider myself dead so i don't want to say that is how it is elsewhere no but i'm just saying he reminded us that life is living for others [Music] do you believe that so when you can reach out to someone else that means you are living what the prophet said [Music] of holy following the lord because kaleb was given the promise [Music] all baptized unto moses foreign that with many of them tivan who booked god was not least catholic amen they just said the same manner like uh they drank of the same rock they they they sang when they crossed the red seas all of them recognized moses so the prophet was a prophet but never achieved are you all talking about going to the promised land [Music] so any church in this world can you say your name that opens the bible to read as they are as their references they preach the truth even though they are their denominations that if only they can but the word is [Applause] amen amen but now the demarcation comes in here kathy oh the separating line the boundary was here and that boundary maybe it was not a physical boundary it was not even a visible boundary does not look at the outward appearance [Music] one thing is [Music] was the last book was the last castle of moses before moses dies and then before they inherited from islam to enter into the there are so many things that are going to happen what are we doing there are people who are going to neglect or despise the prophets but there's a group of people never welcome in your carbon amen who are going to they will not care i believe i'm talking to some people here [Applause] of the situations some of the very fundamental things the holy the holy laws of god and how they ought to be you know to to fear god take a he also gives blessings to the 12 tribes of israel if you uh maybe sometimes look at those blessings of moses some of them were even not contradicting but somehow they were bringing in grace to some of the tribes than the ones that jacob had given [Music] he was not even given any blessing amen because of what he had done or whatever you're calling but when moses is blessing them in deuteronomy chapter 33 is given a blessing hallelujah so it's a wonderful book but it's not about where you become from it's not how you are in the beginning like reuben what he did him to be judged that is to show you that in this journey of grace you start with condemnation when you recognize you are seen when you recognize you are not worthy you are in the condition of will be better than your hallelujah position hallelujah and now it came to where the the place that's called espana and the people suggested to moses to the promise that they went to israel and they came back with a report and the initial reports good among all of them because [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] my generous name is a bible they came with the fruit of the land but genetic arabic amen hallelujah hallelujah and i believe all of us here is that no i know long as you've been in the message church at least you [Music] we want to classify the you know that which is a great blessing and a you know a blessing that can be despised many times to do that i mean if someone came and just are just a you know testified here i want to write there now and i just [Music] at the end of the day [Music] look at me i want to tell you one day when i was in uganda here come baboon are you going to uganda i did a level in ballet at one time i lived one year in a few months there was a time all the food in the house was finished we were renting a place prior to inaccuracies so all the food got finished no rice no nothing no matter what it can be including the kerosene for the la for the for the stuff now i'm afraid when we left in the morning we didn't have anything in the house we were going to stay you know just and maybe in the evening to go and look for a friend we can try to probably together [Music] but somehow along the way just before we reached home lo and behold there was a piece of sugar cane on the side and we pretended like you were playing football with him just like that you're doing it very well my brother until you reach here there are no people what do you think i want to say yes he had lunch prophecy and we were not born again we are not even saved but i remember we watched it means you can approach it and we gave thanks to god and because i was doing something called divinity i don't know it's still there and we were studying about christian living hope in the class ate by thanksgiving we dried my chicken within a short while somebody came from kenya kenya we were not expecting him he never said he was coming and that was the end of our problems [Applause] oh out of faith so deuteronomy extremely traumatic express also the condition that was done in the wilderness things that these people went through and when they brought the evidence that the land was there and even the fruit of that land amen i mean but the the majority again i went to singapore the 10 out [Music] the word of god concerning hallelujah amen hallelujah amen i mean but now the ending point the starting shot of these 10 guys oh it was that thing we said last time about and the evidence is men never said by money their faces were you know just horrible [Music] and when these ten spies they twelve they looked uh you know in comparison [Music] the grapes the fruits [Music] it's actually because of that weakness or wonderful world enough that god chose you yes amen don't we sit by david the other brothers who are bigger [Music] god [Music] but even my mind cannot accept that but then linda was a younger branch was maybe at most 45kg [Music] amen just like jesus i assume when we see his picture what he looks a very nice man you know with a nice face with a nice shave you know where i need for now who can walk in the streets of namu gonna go [Music] that's the streets that in the wilderness now they had someone had tried the preproach of christ someone had to take oh moon the reproach of christ and stand against the others and say regardless of the structure of these men but we are more than [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] steal the people before moses and say let us go up at once hallelujah let us go up at once and possess it and see to delete that we are well able to overcome it hallelujah let us go up at once let us not sit around and try to argue with your let us go up at once hey let us preach together let us say let me go up at once let me go up at once where to my possession a really angry hallelujah i mean go preaching yourself that at home gain anger wherever we need to engineer you as you shall be on the right door preach to yourself everybody speak to yourself you'll get a jolly encourage [Music] joshua amen you're just being returned to your own possession oh democrat is a video you are going back your possession for your video i don't see your situation now i can't see your condition see that i'm better i don't care what you can tell me this has happened all i care about belongs to you i'm willing the land is yours oh i feel like telling the devil [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah amen amen [Music] amen amen oh the lord is good this is why we are here today my brother pass amen i mean you have to be delivered it's to be free to worship our god to worship god praise god we don't care about the devil to god satan we don't care about his intentions the two fights can be a gala he is already defeated [Music] amen i mean oh let's just go for the lord amen but that never stopped him from being the prophet of the age amen i mean maybe i have my own declarations yo you know they'll be angry other preachers will be angry in this generation say those words of the prophet even if you take me to hell and if i'm following the prophet and maybe you went to hell in the lord amen amen so i don't have any discussions with people on that that is they were separating themselves from god and therefore they were leaving the peace of god the joy of the lord is and now they are putting themselves in the hands of saturn where there is no peace there's no contentment there is no sobriety [Music] and the prophet says in this message stand still 1957. paragraph 16. and now the whole world seems to be alarmed just as it was in these days of caleb the world is floating with the majority of ideas and in that message after the prophet says that psychiatrists in the united states america are going to each other you know they are looking for psychiatry from our fellow psychiatrists to tell you all of them are mentally you know affected [Music] these are very landed professionals and when this security is seeing his patients may be counseling about his situation why he's drinking too much why is smoking too much wait on you oh this guy leaves him a book maybe a small manual and says you go through that for some short while 15 minutes [Music] 85 of the north american [Music] and the same spirit has caught up in kampala amen sometimes you're even crossing a road where there is a traffic you are you are passing behind a car here in america and the one who is coming here now he's really hooting at you baby man people are just rushing but really they are going nowhere [Music] amen then the prophet says then i give this solemn morning to the church are you in that church whatever can you say you are in the church of the prophet then i give this song to the church stand [Music] a new ticket people started wishing 20 to end our video in february this is the year omaha 2020. very happy it's a study like this [Music] january january
