[49:06] god is a
[49:08] Healer uh this evening I do not know is
[49:10] there anybody
[49:42] yeah sometimes I think we can even do
[49:44] without
[49:48] interpretation
[49:50] but when you ask like that people don't
[49:53] raise their
[49:55] hands and then when they go out
[49:58] there you hear them
[50:01] talking it is better with
[50:05] interpretation yeah so some people can
[50:09] hear
[50:11] English but they hear better with
[50:17] interpretation I'm happy to see every
[50:19] one of you
[50:22] this amen clap for the Lord to allow you
[50:28] it's a
[50:29] blessing uh I've been having this on my
[50:33] heart for a long long
[50:36] time but I've been waiting for the for
[50:39] the right
[50:41] opportunity I believe there is always a
[50:45] season a
[50:47] season a
[50:50] season uh I'll just say a few remarks
[50:54] before we go to the word
[50:57] by God's grace I have been opportuned to
[51:01] I don't know if that's the right word to
[51:03] uh be in starting
[51:11] congregations from
[51:15] nothing you see two people becoming
[51:18] three becoming four 5 10 20 30
[51:22] 40 I've seen that
[51:25] happen and uh here at dvf is the I can
[51:29] say maybe the third time I have seen it
[51:36] happening and um the second time where I
[51:39] have been the one you know to lead the
[51:44] flock the first being inis
[51:48] Ababa but one thing I can
[51:51] say the difference uh between a church
[51:55] that begins from scratch and a church
[52:00] that begins by separating from another
[52:10] church is um when a church begins from
[52:13] scratch everything is
[52:18] organic uh I don't know if
[52:25] the yes there is no plastic
[52:29] thing if someone doesn't know how to
[52:32] pray they don't know how to pray and
[52:33] they they want to know how
[52:36] to and they want to
[52:38] know so they will hear you teach
[52:42] them a person who does not have the Holy
[52:45] Spirit will be I don't have the Holy
[52:49] Spirit and they want to get the Holy
[52:52] Spirit but the when a church breaks a
[52:56] way and they start a
[53:00] church it becomes difficult because
[53:03] everybody thinks they
[53:06] know and so when you teach something
[53:09] they will not take it in
[53:15] easily um if you notice brother bham was
[53:18] usually going to um
[53:23] churches of so-called Believers or
[53:25] Christians
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] but the gift that he had that was
[53:31] operating through his
[53:34] ministry did not operate as
[53:41] such to a greater
[53:45] magnitude the reason
[53:47] was because these Christians they think
[53:50] they know
[53:52] much and so they becomes
[53:55] touchy they become
[53:58] cold sometimes they become
[54:01] larm and so it is difficult to break
[54:03] through
[54:06] them it takes a long time you have toach
[54:12] conv but you see when he came to
[54:15] Africa in South
[54:17] Africa to be
[54:19] precise there was a
[54:22] Revival there was a Revival and he said
[54:25] those people most of them were of course
[54:27] black
[54:29] people but you see most of them were
[54:32] just like what you would call
[54:36] nonbelievers and others denominational
[54:39] people like
[54:41] Catholics they were just hungry for
[54:45] God and when they see something they
[54:47] believe it to be of
[54:49] God and God used them in a mighty mighty
[54:53] way in such a way that they re received
[54:57] it whatever God was doing they were
[55:00] receiv and many of them were
[55:04] healed by
[55:07] thousands they CED
[55:13] crutches of people who were
[55:16] lame you know by
[55:18] thousands
[55:21] wheelchairs but people who were
[55:23] healed they were not even touched
[55:28] but because they they saw someone being
[55:32] healed they saw a little designment
[55:37] here and they believe
[55:39] it and they they all receive it and they
[55:43] were all
[55:44] here but you see with
[55:48] Believers it becomes a bit
[55:50] difficult and um and um you know in
[55:53] Believers churches each Pastor has a
[55:55] direction that God has given him a Grace
[55:57] of
[56:00] ministry and so when someone has already
[56:02] been a
[56:05] Believer when they come join a new
[56:09] church it takes some
[56:12] time for you to for them to sink into
[56:15] that new
[56:17] ministry and so the reason I say those
[56:21] things is because I've been there when
[56:24] you know churches just begin
[56:28] and I know that everything happens in
[56:33] phases and um and I'm seeing that
[56:37] happening in our little Fellowship
[56:41] here um I feel that this is the time
[56:44] this is the
[56:47] season where we many of you are catching
[56:50] the
[56:52] vision the vision of this
[56:54] ministry the vision of the message we
[56:57] have and I feel it's the right time for
[57:02] us to now start our
[57:08] overnight um some people thought I don't
[57:11] believe in
[57:14] it I believe in
[57:16] it I've always believed in
[57:19] it uh but I believe in the leadership of
[57:23] the Holy Spirit
[57:27] it's not a a a man or a group of men to
[57:29] lead the
[57:33] church go tells me pass
[57:36] there and it is difficult for me to pass
[57:39] there I will not question him I'll just
[57:43] pass
[57:44] them I'll just pass and so at this time
[57:48] it doesn't matter whether personally I'm
[57:51] cuz now I was wondering I was just
[57:53] talking to
[57:54] God and was telling asking him a few
[57:58] questions do you want me to be like to
[58:01] lose all my
[58:04] strength why are you bringing
[58:06] Revelations to
[58:09] me that uh taking away all my
[58:13] strength because I'm noticing these days
[58:15] I preach at least four day four times a
[58:19] week because of the inspiration we had
[58:22] of the home
[58:24] s and uh I thought I would not even go
[58:27] to any home
[58:29] sale but somehow it's been working
[58:31] itself
[58:32] out and then now we have
[58:36] overnight and other services but I
[58:39] realize it's not about
[58:41] me it's about God and whatever he
[58:46] says we obey and
[58:49] follow
[58:51] amen and thank you for
[58:54] coming um that means you're supporting
[58:57] the
[58:58] vision and I believe that God is going
[59:00] to bless you
[59:03] immensely there's been some wonderful
[59:06] testimonies uh from the home
[59:09] sales brother brother
[59:12] martin can you come and and give that
[59:14] testimony I think is just a wonderful
[59:16] testimony come and give it before I
[59:18] start
[59:20] preaching I'm telling you when I heard
[59:22] it I was
[59:24] amazed God is going to wonderful
[59:27] things you just wait and
[59:32] see
[59:35] us whatever the Lord tells us to do let
[59:37] us do it amen
[59:45] amen yeah God bless you
[59:48] sa good
[59:51] evening amen yeah yesterday God gave us
[59:54] a very wonderful time at our place
[59:59] last

[1:05:39] their so if they do
[1:05:42] so through your
[1:05:44] prayers I will also need to take
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:52] the yeah because everybody there how God
[1:05:55] designed
[1:05:59] yeah I've really I've always I'm one
[1:06:01] person I've always enjoyed the way uh
[1:06:03] the way God uses Pastor to package the
[1:06:09] word most especially when it comes to
[1:06:12] the message of the
[1:06:14] hour yeah so let us pray about
[1:06:18] it yeah you never know maybe it may even
[1:06:20] be
[1:06:24] tomorrow bless
[1:06:28] amen and that's not
[1:06:30] all there is also something going on
[1:06:35] in uh it all started uh with where is
[1:06:39] Sister
[1:06:42] Ruth is she inside here I can't see
[1:06:45] her she stepped out uhuh that's why I
[1:06:48] told uhhuh I was not seeing you because
[1:06:50] of this
[1:06:51] pillar that's why I requested the people
[1:06:53] who are this side to come see this side
[1:06:57] started with sister
[1:06:59] Ruth one time here in the in the
[1:07:04] service um she gave um a message in
[1:07:10] tongues and the
[1:07:13] interpretation and was calling out
[1:07:16] several names of several brothers who
[1:07:18] are
[1:07:21] ministering who are starting up in
[1:07:23] Ministry
[1:07:25] I don't know how many remember
[1:07:27] that and the message was position
[1:07:33] yourself now sometimes messages come
[1:07:35] like
[1:07:36] that and you do not everybody will
[1:07:39] interpret it their
[1:07:41] own but if the message is yours you can
[1:07:43] never
[1:07:45] understand even The Giver cannot
[1:07:49] understand but the one given will
[1:07:52] understand if it is from the Lord
[1:07:56] and so um later on sham and his wife
[1:07:59] came to
[1:08:01] me regarding that
[1:08:03] message and um you know when the message
[1:08:07] came out um the the wife of Shem thought
[1:08:13] something and shame also thought
[1:08:15] something and and they came together
[1:08:18] later on so what do you think about that
[1:08:21] message and each of them was thinking
[1:08:23] about it the same way
[1:08:26] about what the Lord had told them
[1:08:32] about where they
[1:08:34] live and what they're supposed to do and
[1:08:38] and it's a long
[1:08:40] story
[1:08:41] but um so they came to me spoke to me
[1:08:46] and we prayed together um felt that the
[1:08:49] something the Lord wanted them to do as
[1:08:51] far as Ministry is concerned
[1:08:56] and um so uh we just prayed together
[1:08:59] advis
[1:09:00] them and then they
[1:09:03] left so I think after a while Shem tells
[1:09:08] me he had seen um uh I think a
[1:09:13] dream regarding a certain denominational
[1:09:21] church and this denominational Church
[1:09:26] they he they went there and they were
[1:09:28] received and later on he also welcomed
[1:09:31] me
[1:09:32] there and these people according to the
[1:09:34] dream received the
[1:09:37] message and even the pastor was saying
[1:09:39] now I can no longer
[1:09:42] preach but the point is
[1:09:44] this that that place that specific
[1:09:49] place he did not know any church
[1:09:52] there and so he kept on asking
[1:09:57] uh what do you think it meant because I
[1:10:00] see no church in that
[1:10:02] area and I kept on asking did you see it
[1:10:05] every week I've been asking did you
[1:10:06] finally see the
[1:10:08] church I mean it's like you seeing in a
[1:10:11] vision or in a dream a church just here
[1:10:14] and you know there is no church
[1:10:19] here and so we've been trying to find a
[1:10:22] place where they can be gathering and
[1:10:24] meeting the other friends who want to
[1:10:26] also hear the
[1:10:29] message but you see according to the
[1:10:31] dream he was like okay now these people
[1:10:33] have believed we don't we don't even
[1:10:35] need a place
[1:10:39] anymore and so uh this pastor comes
[1:10:43] up and um you know believes the
[1:10:46] message anyways so that was the
[1:10:49] dream how long ago is it 2 3 weeks ago
[1:10:52] two months
[1:10:54] ago yeah two months ago and so recent I
[1:10:58] think it also happened this
[1:11:00] week it called me very
[1:11:02] excited say can you imagine I have seen
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:07] place I have seen the church at the
[1:11:10] exact
[1:11:12] place and and so he walked in there and
[1:11:16] the people received him as he had
[1:11:19] seen and the reason why he had not seen
[1:11:22] the church is because it's like some
[1:11:23] kind of Institution
[1:11:28] and so they have like a chapel
[1:11:31] there and so um and they're very
[1:11:37] receptive and um I wanted you to hear
[1:11:39] the testimony of Martin also hear this
[1:11:42] because I want you to
[1:11:43] pray God is up to
[1:11:47] something God is up to something this
[1:11:50] Gospel of the
[1:11:52] Kingdom should reach up to the uttermost
[1:11:54] parts
[1:11:58] everywhere when you hear the sister
[1:12:00] Esther was telling
[1:12:02] me also brother Marvin were informing me
[1:12:05] because brother Marvin has been going
[1:12:06] there to minister
[1:12:08] every and that they are saying that now
[1:12:12] the questions are too
[1:12:14] many I think brother Marin you had to
[1:12:16] run away one of the of the days when it
[1:12:18] had gotten
[1:12:21] Sol the people are
[1:12:23] coming at the home of
[1:12:25] es they hearing the message but been
[1:12:29] preaching and they asking
[1:12:31] questions and they are not yet
[1:12:33] satisfied they want more I tell you what
[1:12:37] we have is
[1:12:39] gone and therefore I believe the the
[1:12:42] grace that God has given to
[1:12:44] us and is giving to us to take
[1:12:47] it let's do
[1:12:49] it but remember we cannot be able to
[1:12:52] penetrate
[1:12:55] without
[1:12:56] prayer and so it is
[1:12:59] appropriate that at this time we begin
[1:13:02] our overnight
[1:13:07] prayers not 20 minutes of
[1:13:09] prayer 30 minutes of prayer several
[1:13:12] hours of
[1:13:14] prayer and before we do that I I would
[1:13:16] like us to go into the scriptures if you
[1:13:18] can stand we go to the Book of
[1:13:22] Revelations chapter 3
[1:13:31] vers
[1:13:39] 15
[1:13:40] amen we are up for a wonderful night
[1:13:47] tonight so those ones who have been
[1:13:49] planning to
[1:13:53] sleep forget about
[1:13:57] it of course you won't even have time to
[1:13:59] do
[1:14:02] it
[1:14:04] amen chapter 3:
[1:14:08] 15 and I'm I'm reading in the name of
[1:14:11] the Lord
[1:14:12] Jesus I'll begin from 14 and unto the

[1:14:17] these things sayith the amen the
[1:14:18] faithful and the true and true witness

[1:16:05] amen as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:16:08] chest be zealous therefore and
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:16] repent behold I stand at the door and
[1:16:18] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:16:21] the door I will come into him and will s
[1:16:24] with him and he will with
[1:16:36] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:16:39] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:16:42] overcame even I even I also over even as
[1:16:47] I also overcame and I'm set down with my
[1:16:49] father in his throne he that has an hear
[1:16:52] Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:16:54] the chch
[1:17:11] you may be
[1:17:16] seated so Brethren this
[1:17:20] evening um the subject I I have I don't
[1:17:23] even know whether I will touch it
[1:17:26] ingredients of
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] Revival that's what I want to talk
[1:17:33] about um you know what we are doing is
[1:17:36] not
[1:17:37] easy it's a sacrifice serving God is not
[1:17:42] easy it is a
[1:17:45] sacrifice you believe that don't
[1:17:48] you and so don't be Weare in doing well
[1:17:52] doing good
[1:17:55] in due
[1:17:56] time you shall be
[1:17:59] rewarded the Bible says I stand at the
[1:18:01] door and and
[1:18:04] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:18:07] the door I will come into him and S with
[1:18:09] him and he with
[1:18:13] me the reason why I started with this
[1:18:17] scripture is to show you where Jesus is
[1:18:20] in our
[1:18:22] generation he is outside
[1:18:25] of the people's
[1:18:28] hearts has rejected
[1:18:31] him if you notice all other
[1:18:35] Generations they never rejected him they
[1:18:39] had they accepted him but they had some
[1:18:41] elements among them that were not
[1:18:46] good but laia is very
[1:18:50] cunning
[1:18:52] stubborn this is a generation
[1:18:57] speaking
[1:18:59] ofia
[1:19:00] whatever call this is a
[1:19:04] generation that actually has many
[1:19:07] Christians professing
[1:19:11] Christians but it is the most
[1:19:14] hypocritical
[1:19:18] age whereby people are very many in
[1:19:23] church but do of the word are very
[1:19:28] few until Jesus himself has
[1:19:34] complained and he has said you've kicked
[1:19:36] me out of your
[1:19:38] hearts I stand at the
[1:19:41] door I am outside of your
[1:19:44] heart but I'm on the door of your
[1:19:48] heart and I am
[1:19:50] knocking he a personal affair
[1:19:56] you see we are
[1:19:57] Gentiles and we are not going to worship
[1:20:00] God like the Jews
[1:20:02] do to the Jews he comes to them as a
[1:20:07] nation to us he comes to us as
[1:20:12] individuals we must be ready to work our
[1:20:15] salvation with fear and
[1:20:19] trembling you must have a desire for God
[1:20:22] as an individual
[1:20:26] whether your parents are
[1:20:28] believers or not whether you have a
[1:20:32] brother as a Believer or sister a
[1:20:33] Believer or
[1:20:35] not or whether your husband or wife is a
[1:20:38] Believer or
[1:20:40] not brother sister listen you must find
[1:20:44] God as an
[1:20:46] individual because this generation
[1:20:49] ofia has kicked out
[1:20:52] Jesus but now remember they have not
[1:20:54] rejected him
[1:20:58] outright but Jesus is the one
[1:21:01] complaining that they have kicked him
[1:21:06] out but for them they are calling
[1:21:09] themselves
[1:21:11] believers they are
[1:21:13] worshiping they are
[1:21:14] praying they they in churches but Jesus
[1:21:18] is saying I am on the
[1:21:22] outside I want to say even believe of
[1:21:25] this
[1:21:26] message they have intellectually
[1:21:29] accepted the
[1:21:32] word but in their
[1:21:34] life they have kicked out
[1:21:38] Jesus in our life we have kicked him
[1:21:43] out if I ask you a question is he in
[1:21:45] your
[1:21:47] life is he how do you know he
[1:21:51] is if he is in your lifestyle
[1:21:57] if the life you are
[1:21:59] living is worthy of the
[1:22:02] Gospel if Jesus was to come
[1:22:06] tonight you would be ready to
[1:22:09] go then you know he is in your
[1:22:12] heart but Jesus is not happy with
[1:22:16] our because they kicked him
[1:22:19] out by their life they have rejected
[1:22:23] him and Jesus Jesus you know has sent
[1:22:27] the message to the
[1:22:30] messenger and he said I know your
[1:22:33] works I know your works you are not
[1:22:37] called so now what does called
[1:22:40] mean called is
[1:22:43] somebody who has low spiritual
[1:22:49] temperatures someone who rejects
[1:22:53] God someone rejects his word
[1:22:57] outright someone who even says I am an
[1:23:02] arist someone who says these things of
[1:23:05] the Bible don't tell
[1:23:07] me someone who says I am an
[1:23:12] alcoholic I'm a smoker don't tell me
[1:23:15] about God that is a cold woman a cold
[1:23:20] man that is why they can do things until
[1:23:23] you wonder
[1:23:25] they are
[1:23:27] coldhearted they don't fear God their
[1:23:31] God is their
[1:23:32] Bell as long as they have what they're
[1:23:35] doing is going to give them
[1:23:37] money they will kill they will steal
[1:23:41] they will fornicate they will commit a
[1:23:44] they will do anything as long as it
[1:23:47] satisfies
[1:23:49] them you know that is a cold
[1:23:51] person cold hearted
[1:23:55] but now toan
[1:23:58] Christians God is saying you are not
[1:24:04] called but also he says you are not
[1:24:08] hot because who is a hot
[1:24:12] Christian someone who is on
[1:24:16] fire someone you don't need to ask
[1:24:18] whether they are a Believer or
[1:24:21] not you know they are a believer
[1:24:25] by the life they
[1:24:26] live you know they are a Believer by the
[1:24:30] friends they
[1:24:31] keep by the friends they
[1:24:34] keep you know they are Believer by the
[1:24:37] friends they cut away from themselves
[1:24:40] the way they walk the way they dress the
[1:24:44] way they believe you know you know they
[1:24:46] are a
[1:24:47] Believer because of their
[1:24:50] convictions by the music they listen to
[1:24:54] you know you cannot even ask
[1:24:56] yourself is there is he a Believer who
[1:24:58] is you know no no no you already know by
[1:25:02] seeing them or by talking to them one
[1:25:05] minute but in our
[1:25:08] generation Jesus is
[1:25:11] complaining he is saying you are not
[1:25:15] cold you are not hot and is not happy at
[1:25:20] all and he's saying I wish
[1:25:24] you were
[1:25:26] cold or
[1:25:29] hot and he continues on so then because
[1:25:34] you are
[1:25:38] larm because you are
[1:25:40] lukewarm now listen church this
[1:25:44] condition is not only in the Pentecostal
[1:25:46] religions and other religion
[1:25:55] it a it is a condition of our
[1:25:59] age if you are not
[1:26:01] careful even as a believer of this
[1:26:05] message you can end up being
[1:26:09] lukewarm they
[1:26:14] religion why because they claim to serve
[1:26:18] God but when you look at the way they
[1:26:20] dress sincerely they are not serving God
[1:26:24] when you see what they are doing their
[1:26:27] life you can say no when you see what
[1:26:30] they
[1:26:32] believing you can say no these ones are
[1:26:35] they
[1:26:36] lukewarm even the preachers they
[1:26:39] preaching for
[1:26:41] money they they selling oil they selling
[1:26:45] water you know
[1:26:47] they what about the Believers of this
[1:26:50] message for me today I'm not attacking
[1:26:53] anyone
[1:26:55] I am attacking the Believers of the
[1:26:58] message because we are the ones who are
[1:27:01] believers he's saying you are
[1:27:05] lukewarm what brings this condition of
[1:27:09] lukewarmness where someone is a
[1:27:12] professed
[1:27:14] believer but their life speaks another
[1:27:20] thing that is a luk one believer
[1:27:25] where someone claims to
[1:27:27] believe but his life
[1:27:31] refuses he tells others I'm a Believer
[1:27:33] God bless
[1:27:34] you but his life is saying are you sure
[1:27:38] you a
[1:27:39] Believer and maybe you are here and you
[1:27:42] know you
[1:27:44] are God is saying you should not
[1:27:47] be be H or be
[1:27:50] cold be
[1:27:52] choose choose this day who you will
[1:27:56] serve will you continue to be
[1:27:59] lukew or you will be on fire for
[1:28:04] God what are you going to
[1:28:06] become let me tell you
[1:28:09] Church Satan can believe everything we
[1:28:14] believe did I hear you say Amen on
[1:28:17] that Satan can believe there is one
[1:28:21] God the Bible says you believe there is
[1:28:23] one
[1:28:26] you have done well even demons
[1:28:29] believe and they
[1:28:32] tremble Satan believes it and even
[1:28:36] trembles he believes in one
[1:28:39] God Satan doesn't is not
[1:28:43] aarian I want denominations who believe
[1:28:45] in the
[1:28:47] TR Satan has deceived
[1:28:50] them to believe in something he himself
[1:28:53] does not believe
[1:28:57] so he looks at them believing the
[1:29:00] Trinity and himself tells them you are
[1:29:04] dumb how can you believe three
[1:29:07] Gods me I believe there is one God but I
[1:29:10] deceived you to believe like
[1:29:12] that so you believe in one
[1:29:15] God Satan believes that
[1:29:17] too can believe all the collection of
[1:29:20] things we believe
[1:29:24] believes women should not wear
[1:29:30] trousers Satan doesn't believe in women
[1:29:35] preachers are you following me sat
[1:29:39] believes in
[1:29:41] Holiness sat believes in
[1:29:46] Holiness he believes everything the
[1:29:48] Bible
[1:29:50] says yes I am not crazy
[1:29:54] everything I'm saying is
[1:29:56] correct but there is one
[1:29:58] thing Satan has no ability to
[1:30:04] do Satan has no ability to live the life
[1:30:07] of what he believes
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:13] Hallelujah but he believes it he even
[1:30:17] anoints preachers to preach his message
[1:30:19] of holiness
[1:30:24] preaching it everywhere but he doesn't
[1:30:27] have a
[1:30:29] life to back up his
[1:30:32] message are you hearing me Church the
[1:30:35] only difference between
[1:30:37] us and religion is the ability to have
[1:30:41] the
[1:30:43] life and we cannot oh listen to me
[1:30:47] tonight we cannot only preach you into
[1:30:50] that life

[1:35:24] problem whereby he was
[1:35:27] confused about his
[1:35:29] life he was wondering some people were
[1:35:33] telling him he had a demon in
[1:35:34] him because he was hearing voices seeing
[1:35:39] visions and others were telling him of
[1:35:42] God others so he was
[1:35:45] confused which is which he read books he
[1:35:49] was preaching the gospel but still
[1:35:51] confused
[1:35:53] still
[1:35:54] confused he sat under
[1:35:57] preaching still confused you can sit
[1:36:00] under preaching and you will be
[1:36:05] confused you can hear people
[1:36:08] preaching and they will confuse you
[1:36:11] more but I'll tell you the
[1:36:14] solution brother Bram went to a
[1:36:17] cave and he started
[1:36:20] praying a place where there was no one
[1:36:25] a place where there where no one
[1:36:28] knew he didn't say hey hey I'm going for
[1:36:32] pray he went to be shut in with
[1:36:37] God he wanted to
[1:36:40] meet God so that God can explain to him
[1:36:43] things he did not
[1:36:47] understand God can explain to
[1:36:50] you things that have confused your life
[1:36:54] God can reveal to you things you
[1:36:57] confused
[1:36:59] about that is what our God
[1:37:02] can let me tell you some people have
[1:37:05] tapped the anointing of brother

[1:41:04] believer we are believing that
[1:41:07] message Hallelujah of the Angel of the
[1:41:11] Lord and that angel of the Lord is with
[1:41:13] the message
[1:41:16] of and anyone who
[1:41:19] believe that message of the hour with
[1:41:22] all their hearts
[1:41:24] nothing can stand
[1:41:28] before amen that means not
[1:41:31] demon no Spirit no
[1:41:35] addiction no sickness can remain
[1:41:39] there why because the pillar of
[1:41:44] fire is with the
[1:41:49] bright Hallelujah who is following the
[1:41:52] message
[1:41:55] so now why do we
[1:41:57] suffer and we don't get
[1:42:00] delivered and we
[1:42:03] Remain the
[1:42:06] condition because we don't want to do
[1:42:09] what
[1:42:11] did we don't want to
[1:42:15] pray Believers are the weakest prayer
[1:42:19] people
[1:42:23] do you have a relationship with
[1:42:26] God do you
[1:42:28] pray how long do you
[1:42:31] pray did you know you are supposed to
[1:42:33] pray every
[1:42:36] day did you know you are supposed to
[1:42:38] have a personal devotion with
[1:42:43] God we don't even need to call a prayer
[1:42:46] and fasting
[1:42:49] session you don't need to remember
[1:42:51] prayer when you come for overnight
[1:42:57] overnight should be one of the
[1:42:59] sessions that bring all our leaks of
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:04] fire and then we come here and we begin
[1:43:08] to light
[1:43:09] up and burn every demon
[1:43:13] Spirit but you see if you were not
[1:43:17] praying in your own prayer
[1:43:21] altar you will come here and
[1:43:24] sleep you will still you will say you
[1:43:27] are
[1:43:28] tired you know some people are consoling
[1:43:31] themselves that they are tired when
[1:43:34] Jesus was here on Earth you know what
[1:43:39] Jesus was always
[1:43:41] praying are you saying to me that he was
[1:43:44] not
[1:43:45] tired let me tell you our body will be
[1:43:49] tired but our spirit can never be TI
[1:43:56] and that's why personal
[1:44:02] intercession is the way
[1:44:06] forward and and and I'll show you here
[1:44:10] in the Book of Ezekiel chapter
[1:44:12] 9 vers
[1:44:15] 4 and the Lord said unto
[1:44:17] him go through the midst of the city
[1:44:21] through the midst of Jerusalem and set a
[1:44:23] mark upon the foreheads of the men that
[1:44:26] sigh that cry for all the Abominations
[1:44:30] that be done in the
[1:44:49] mid now now did you see this Mark
[1:44:53] let me ask you what do you think is this
[1:44:58] Mark what is this
[1:45:01] Mark because I I only know two types of
[1:45:07] Mark the first one is what Cain
[1:45:11] received The Mark of
[1:45:14] Cain which actually we realize later
[1:45:17] on the same mark of the
[1:45:21] beast and we
[1:45:23] found that everyone who does not
[1:45:27] believe the truth receives
[1:45:31] that and everyone who
[1:45:36] Associates with
[1:45:39] nonbelievers their
[1:45:41] systems receives
[1:45:45] that
[1:45:47] now how do you receive the mark of
[1:45:51] God Jesus told them go in the upper room
[1:45:55] let me ask you a question why didn't he
[1:45:58] give to them that Holy
[1:46:01] Spirit without going to
[1:46:04] pray because he's a
[1:46:07] father a father doesn't give you
[1:46:09] anything unless you ask for
[1:46:12] it did you receive anything from your
[1:46:14] father without
[1:46:17] asking you ask no even when I was a baby
[1:46:21] I was asking
[1:46:23] yes by
[1:46:26] crying you cried for everything you
[1:46:29] wanted you cried everything so he gave
[1:46:32] it to you and he gave you more than you
[1:46:37] need so now our heavenly
[1:46:42] father also says this if the Earth
[1:46:48] parents cannot withhold any good thing
[1:46:51] from their children
[1:46:55] how much more our heavenly
[1:46:59] father if we ask for
[1:47:02] bread he cannot give us
[1:47:04] stores if we ask for fish he cannot give
[1:47:08] us something else he will give us
[1:47:11] exactly what we
[1:47:14] ask now
[1:47:16] Ezekiel has taken it on another
[1:47:20] level and he has said because remember I
[1:47:23] began in the Book of
[1:47:24] Revelation where I was speaking about
[1:47:28] ladia and the Bible says in ladia there
[1:47:30] they
[1:47:32] L they are wretched they poor they
[1:47:36] miserable they are blind they are
[1:47:40] naked but they don't
[1:47:42] know now they are
[1:47:45] confused is a bunch of confused
[1:47:50] people even in our churches
[1:47:53] confus
[1:47:57] people I was so
[1:47:59] surprised when I was at
[1:48:03] ucu and I was told later on I did not
[1:48:06] know that one of the of the sisters that
[1:48:10] came wearing a
[1:48:13] trouser was a
[1:48:15] believer of the
[1:48:19] message and that when I went there I was
[1:48:22] so
[1:48:23] anointed and I preached
[1:48:26] against and by the way I never
[1:48:28] do when there are people who are we I
[1:48:31] don't know what came over me that day I
[1:48:34] really roed
[1:48:37] them and this sister was there and I
[1:48:42] heard that she was very
[1:48:46] offended and she hasn't come back to
[1:48:48] those
[1:48:49] meetings let me tell you I'm using her I
[1:48:52] don't even know her
[1:48:55] exle but I
[1:48:58] wonder that's why Paul said
[1:49:02] oh
[1:49:04] Beed who Beed you that you start in the
[1:49:09] spirit you start in the
[1:49:11] spirit and now you are so
[1:49:16] muchal let me read it for you Galatians
[1:49:20] 3 it is so
[1:49:25] heartbreaking so
[1:49:27] heartbreaking you open
[1:49:31] Galatians chapter
[1:49:33] 3 I'm trying to find it here can you
[1:49:35] read it if you found
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:45] it Galatians who has Bewitched you
[1:49:50] foolish Galatians
[1:49:53] who Beed you that you should not obey
[1:49:56] the
[1:49:58] truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has
[1:50:02] been evidently set
[1:50:05] forth crucified among
[1:50:09] you this only would I learn of
[1:50:14] you received ye the speed by The Works
[1:50:17] of the law by the hearing of faith
[1:50:25] are you so
[1:50:26] foolish having begun in the
[1:50:29] spirit are he now made perfect by the
[1:50:34] flesh now friends I want us to
[1:50:37] understand
[1:50:38] something how can
[1:50:41] someone claim to be a
[1:50:45] believer being a
[1:50:47] sister and we
[1:50:54] and
[1:50:55] walk on the road a
[1:51:00] Christian the Bible in the book of deom
[1:51:05] 22 he called such a
[1:51:07] woman
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:16] Anin and you find a sister I hope we
[1:51:20] don't have any who does that
[1:51:23] because if we do you need
[1:51:26] Deliverance the highest form of
[1:51:30] it but when we see those things around
[1:51:34] us what should it make us
[1:51:38] do a Believer called by the name
[1:51:43] believer living
[1:51:47] immorally
[1:51:50] shamess shamess
[1:51:53] because you see an immortal
[1:51:55] sin is a deliberate
[1:51:58] one you don't fall into
[1:52:04] it it was a
[1:52:07] mistake can you cannot fornicate by
[1:52:13] mistake it is impossible are you hearing
[1:52:17] it is
[1:52:19] impossible because how does it start
[1:52:23] you plan
[1:52:26] it especially it begins on the
[1:52:30] phone it begins on the phone all of you
[1:52:33] have
[1:52:34] phon how are you using your
[1:52:36] phone and I will tell you how you use
[1:52:39] that if you're not active on the church
[1:52:43] group and you're not active on the on
[1:52:46] the land F
[1:52:48] groups you never write any message
[1:52:52] any of your department
[1:52:54] groups then we know where you
[1:52:58] active because if if indeed you are not
[1:53:01] just
[1:53:03] active why do you have
[1:53:09] WhatsApp I'm sorry you know me I don't
[1:53:12] use
[1:53:13] WhatsApp delete them
[1:53:16] brother delete them
[1:53:19] sister because if you have it you are
[1:53:23] using
[1:53:23] it and if you're using it not with the
[1:53:27] Believers you are using it with the
[1:53:30] world you are
[1:53:33] compromised and you're
[1:53:36] compromising now what am I trying to
[1:53:40] say I am
[1:53:42] saying that you begin
[1:53:46] there getting into someone's
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:51] inbox and then you send a
[1:53:53] message hello dear how are
[1:53:58] you and then you also
[1:54:00] know this brother is calling me
[1:54:04] dear you also as if you did not see the
[1:54:08] word yes my
[1:54:11] brother amen how are
[1:54:14] you and then to begins there it goes
[1:54:18] degrading degrading degrading degrading
[1:54:21] as you get used you want
[1:54:23] another and before you know
[1:54:26] it you your emotions are
[1:54:30] changing your mind is
[1:54:32] changing you have
[1:54:34] entitlements to them
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:38] even how come you don't call
[1:54:42] me Brethren by the time you reach
[1:54:49] there and you need to repent
[1:54:52] you need a
[1:54:55] Revival and the ingredient of
[1:54:59] Revival is a
[1:55:02] prayer go in
[1:55:04] prayer for us when we were
[1:55:07] young and tempted by the things of the
[1:55:10] world the only way we need to
[1:55:14] overcome is going in
[1:55:17] prayer you just create a
[1:55:20] situation I will not eat I'm not do
[1:55:22] anything you're going in prayer you are
[1:55:25] in
[1:55:27] church you fight with all those little
[1:55:30] demons and then you come out feeling you
[1:55:33] a
[1:55:33] Victor they come again you go back they
[1:55:38] come again you go back they come again
[1:55:41] it is a
[1:55:43] battle if the devil Wes war on
[1:55:47] you you also
[1:55:50] declare declare a
[1:55:53] and the only way a Believer declares
[1:55:57] war is by going into fasting and
[1:56:01] pray you know Israel is a
[1:56:04] nation that fears no
[1:56:07] man even they said even if America does
[1:56:10] not stand with
[1:56:12] us we will go we will
[1:56:17] fight and they are fighting a war on
[1:56:20] seven fronts
[1:56:24] but they are fighting all of them and
[1:56:26] they a very small nation but the reason
[1:56:29] why they are
[1:56:30] fighting is not because they're very
[1:56:33] powerful but I'll tell you two reasons
[1:56:36] number one they fighting for their
[1:56:40] life they have a reason to
[1:56:43] fight their war is not like the American
[1:56:45] war on
[1:56:48] lib no there war is a war of survival
[1:56:54] and there second reason they
[1:56:56] fighting they know the word of God is on
[1:56:58] their
[1:57:00] side they know they have a
[1:57:03] promise president nany saide
[1:57:07] Minister he said recently when he was
[1:57:10] speaking in
[1:57:11] America I believe in the senator
[1:57:13] wherever it was he said that land was
[1:57:18] given to us by
[1:57:20] God am was on that line Our Father Isaac
[1:57:25] was on that so they know they have
[1:57:29] entitlement to that land because it was
[1:57:33] given to them by
[1:57:35] promise now our land of Holiness our
[1:57:40] land of righteousness has been given to
[1:57:44] us by a Divine
[1:57:48] decree when Jesus died he died for us
[1:57:53] soul body
[1:57:57] Spirit if the devil attacks you in your
[1:58:01] body don't go and begin crying like a
[1:58:04] baby go in prayer where your
[1:58:08] war against the
[1:58:10] enemy but believers they just accept and
[1:58:14] they
[1:58:15] surrender don't sing I surrender to
[1:58:21] Satan when you feel like you have
[1:58:25] fever and you know whenever you say I'm
[1:58:27] going to
[1:58:28] pray the devil brings a lot of reasons
[1:58:31] for you not
[1:58:32] to you know you're feeling fever some of
[1:58:36] you dragged the Holy Spirit dragged
[1:58:40] you I wanted to go today
[1:58:42] but I'm having
[1:58:45] fever maybe I should tell the pastor he
[1:58:47] will understand even the back is and you
[1:58:50] have not been sleeping prop
[1:58:53] the whole of this week I think really
[1:58:56] for
[1:58:57] sure why the devil knows that the only
[1:59:01] way this guy or this woman will defeat
[1:59:05] me is if he goes in prayer so demons
[1:59:09] always be watching
[1:59:11] you
[1:59:13] don't
[1:59:15] don't you know when they were asking uh
[1:59:17] when they were asking President
[1:59:20] Biden whether you know something about
[1:59:24] you know Iran and
[1:59:26] whatever he was just saying
[1:59:29] don't I believe demons are standing
[1:59:31] around
[1:59:32] us and each time you want to go to
[1:59:35] prayer
[1:59:37] don't
[1:59:39] don't
[1:59:41] don't let meay for
[1:59:45] don't don't
[1:59:49] don't and then you are in a spiritual
[1:59:52] you don't
[1:59:53] know even here you have come here but
[1:59:57] demons will try
[2:00:01] to that's when you will feel very
[2:00:04] heavy if you're watching a documentary
[2:00:06] or
[2:00:09] something can watch for
[2:00:12] hours when will you sleep I will
[2:00:17] sleep but when you begin praying
[2:00:23] I know how the other ones make
[2:00:26] it the problem I'm tired you are not
[2:00:30] tired brother those are demons they're
[2:00:33] trying to stop you they're fighting with
[2:00:36] you that's they come to you and they
[2:00:40] give you all sorts of
[2:00:41] excuses brother don't
[2:00:45] accept the only W that you should
[2:00:48] declare that is just
[2:00:52] is a war for your
[2:00:56] survival if you do not
[2:00:59] fight you will not
[2:01:02] win but if you fight you will
[2:01:06] win sometimes you are passing through
[2:01:09] things that you can't
[2:01:12] understand may not be in the
[2:01:15] flesh may be in the
[2:01:17] spirit even you are making money and
[2:01:19] money is refusing to come
[2:01:23] let me tell you go in
[2:01:25] prayer
[2:01:26] pray pray I was hearing some of these
[2:01:30] old
[2:01:32] pastors one of them was giving a
[2:01:34] testimony that even when they wanted
[2:01:36] visas and JS and things like
[2:01:40] that they they were getting it in
[2:01:45] prayer thatth when they go to get a
[2:01:49] job and this man refuses the
[2:01:53] you have the job they will boldly speak
[2:01:55] to them you are
[2:02:06] fired and then he goes in prayer and he
[2:02:10] fires that man or
[2:02:14] that and afterwards he goes and gets the
[2:02:18] job
[2:02:22] don't joke with prayer
[2:02:24] Brothers don't joke with prayer let me
[2:02:27] read for you something
[2:02:29] here don't joke with
[2:02:32] prayer
[2:02:34] prayer is is the only thing a Believer
[2:02:40] has now
[2:02:43] listen is okay I'm reading from the
[2:02:46] paman church
[2:02:48] age I didn't plan to read this but just
[2:02:50] the Holy Spirit brought it to me
[2:02:53] praise the name of the
[2:02:56] Lord historians acknowledge that now
[2:02:59] this is about
[2:03:01] mtin historians acknowledge that
[2:03:04] uh on at least three
[2:03:14] occasions
[2:03:16] he on at least three
[2:03:19] occasions he raised the Dead by
[2:03:23] faith in Jesus name in one instance he
[2:03:28] prayed for a dead Bo
[2:03:31] baby like elishah he
[2:03:35] stretched himself upon the baby and
[2:03:38] prayed he came back to life and
[2:03:44] health on another occasion he was called
[2:03:48] to help deliver a brother who was being
[2:03:52] away to his death in a time of great
[2:04:00] persecution by the time he arrived the
[2:04:03] poor man was already
[2:04:05] dead they had hanged him upon a
[2:04:08] tree his body was
[2:04:11] lifeless and his eyes protruded from the
[2:04:15] sockets but
[2:04:17] Martin took him
[2:04:19] down and when he had PR the man was
[2:04:24] restored to
[2:04:25] life and to his rejoicing
[2:04:29] family do we serve the same
[2:04:33] God but we don't see the
[2:04:36] things because we don't pray
[2:04:40] enough hallu Mar never did fear the
[2:04:45] enemy regardless of who it
[2:04:49] was thus he went to personally f a
[2:04:52] wicked
[2:04:55] Emperor who was responsible for the
[2:04:57] death of many spirit filled
[2:05:02] sin the emperor would not Grant an
[2:05:07] audience sotin went to see a friend of
[2:05:09] the
[2:05:15] emperor so he went one to a man called
[2:05:18] Damascus
[2:05:21] cruel Bishop of
[2:05:24] Rome and the
[2:05:26] bishop being a nominal
[2:05:30] Christian of the false
[2:05:34] Vine he refused to
[2:05:37] intercede for
[2:05:39] Martin Martin went back to the
[2:05:44] Palace now imagine those moments when no
[2:05:47] the answer is
[2:05:49] no you want things and
[2:05:54] listen Martin went back to the Palace
[2:05:57] but by the by now the gates had been
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:02] locked and they would not allow him to
[2:06:05] enter he laid down on his face before
[2:06:08] the
[2:06:10] Lord the gates closed they W allow him
[2:06:14] to enter what do you do he laid down
[2:06:19] before the Lord
[2:06:22] and
[2:06:23] prayed that he be able to get into that
[2:06:29] place oh I want that kind of Reckless
[2:06:35] face may God give us
[2:06:40] that to believe for the
[2:06:44] impossible to believe God is more than
[2:06:48] enough prayer can do anything
[2:06:53] prayer is not a
[2:06:54] joke God is in
[2:06:58] prayer he had a voice beating
[2:07:02] him
[2:07:04] arise he was not
[2:07:07] dreaming he was not
[2:07:09] dreaming this was
[2:07:13] real when he did
[2:07:15] so he saw the gates
[2:07:19] open by theirselves
[2:07:23] he didn't ask who opened it he knew he
[2:07:28] had so he walked into the
[2:07:30] court but the Arrogant
[2:07:34] ruler would not turn his
[2:07:39] head to speak to
[2:07:41] Martin Martin was
[2:07:43] there this one did not even turn his
[2:07:47] head he had closed Martin outside
[2:07:53] and God brought Martin
[2:07:55] inside let me tell you it doesn't matter
[2:07:57] where your blessing has been

[2:22:07] atmosphere where you
[2:22:10] realize that you are in the
[2:22:13] presence of God and you're
[2:22:17] moving to then in the deepest of of
[2:22:25] sincerity first is a
[2:22:29] worship oh Jehovah how I love you you
[2:22:33] see it then after the
[2:22:37] worship then you
[2:22:39] come with a sincere
[2:22:42] heart
[2:22:45] asking praise the name of the
[2:22:48] Lord hallelujah Hallelujah that's how to
[2:22:52] pray that is how to approach
[2:22:55] prayer father the hour has come that
[2:22:58] message then you got to read in the
[2:23:00] Bible and you find out that none of the
[2:23:02] things that Jesus said was going on in
[2:23:05] the
[2:23:08] church this shall follow
[2:23:13] them it doesn't
[2:23:17] follow Jesus said they shall follow them
[2:23:20] that
[2:23:21] believe not they may be
[2:23:26] will perhaps they
[2:23:30] will they will for a certain amount of
[2:23:35] time

[2:23:43] them that
[2:23:45] believe brother let me tell you if you
[2:23:48] don't know what to pray for let me tell
[2:23:49] you what to pray for
[2:23:51] if miracles signs and wonders are not
[2:23:55] following your
[2:23:56] life then go in prayer my
[2:23:59] brother something is not right and don't
[2:24:02] settle for what you
[2:24:05] have I need a miracle Lord I need a
[2:24:09] miracle in my home in my children in the
[2:24:13] church in the work of God I need a
[2:24:16] miracle I need to see them following me
[2:24:20] if they are not there then I need to
[2:24:22] check my experience with
[2:24:25] God and it was promised to the end of
[2:24:27] the
[2:24:29] world I want the page and the scripture
[2:24:31] where he said he took it away from
[2:24:36] them then he would contradict his own
[2:24:40] way see what a mess you would get
[2:24:43] into this sign shall follow
[2:24:47] them that was a marking a Memorial a
[2:24:51] mark of True
[2:24:54] [Applause]
[2:24:58] Believers that he was in the
[2:25:02] mid
[2:25:04] Hallelujah I will mark
[2:25:07] them them who cry and
[2:25:09] S for the Abominations that are done in
[2:25:12] the
[2:25:13] city how will he make you with signs
[2:25:17] Fall Away
[2:25:21] because he showing himself and
[2:25:23] manifesting himself by these
[2:25:26] signs now to think a church built being
[2:25:31] built on
[2:25:33] that let the world creep
[2:25:39] in why certainly it will Rouse the
[2:25:41] indignation of a real true servant of
[2:25:43] God it is
[2:25:46] [Music]
[2:25:49] wrong let's get the thing out of
[2:25:53] there get away from this old lukewarm
[2:25:56] halfway say a little prayer over
[2:26:02] morning
[2:26:04] amen prayer at
[2:26:06] night and go to bed and get up the next
[2:26:10] morning no wonder we are getting
[2:26:14] wildly no wonder we are
[2:26:17] getting do you believe this
[2:26:21] no wonder we are getting
[2:26:24] worldly no wonder the world is Creed
[2:26:27] into the
[2:26:29] church because we don't stay in
[2:26:32] prayer there is no more
[2:26:35] agonizing there is no more staying
[2:26:37] before
[2:26:38] God
[2:26:40] stay not just 1 2 3 4 20 minutes
[2:26:44] no
[2:26:46] stay before God agonizing
[2:26:50] praying from the
[2:26:54] heart there is no more digging
[2:26:57] out cleaning up we need a old fashion
[2:27:05] Revival we just pull ourself we are in
[2:27:07] the assemblies we in the Pentecostal we
[2:27:09] are the Oneness we are we are this we
[2:27:11] are that we don't have nothing with that
[2:27:13] other group
[2:27:17] no that is where the Holy Spirit leaves
[2:27:20] you
[2:27:27] and someone may say that is from
[2:27:31] 1956 but let me read you something from
[2:27:36] 1963 oh Lord just once more they
[2:27:39] remember of seeing that Jo born in his
[2:27:43] hand and saying who else wants some of
[2:27:46] this he was a man who could speak he was
[2:27:50] man who was anointed of
[2:27:52] God God promised to bless him he was in
[2:27:55] the strength of
[2:27:57] Jehovah oh no doubt there is many here
[2:28:01] can remember back when the church stood
[2:28:03] in that kind of
[2:28:08] strength but
[2:28:10] now all broke
[2:28:12] up all kind of
[2:28:14] denominations one fighting the other the
[2:28:18] old all night prayer Mee meetings is not
[2:28:20] hard of no
[2:28:23] more Street meetings is absolutely
[2:28:28] gone they are
[2:28:31] obsolete yet we've got our
[2:28:35] structure we got the
[2:28:38] framework but where is the god of the
[2:28:43] Miracles frankly many
[2:28:45] denied they even deny Divine Healing
[2:28:50] let me tell you many of our M churches
[2:28:52] have nice buildings
[2:28:54] now but I have one question where is
[2:28:58] that God of the
[2:29:00] Miracles where is that God that will
[2:29:02] fire up younger
[2:29:05] men not old men young men and they will
[2:29:09] go on the streets and begin
[2:29:12] preaching younger ladies and they will
[2:29:15] be constantly in
[2:29:17] prayer you see how old these Revival
[2:29:19] start
[2:29:23] it was out of
[2:29:25] prayer God used a man called William
[2:29:29] Sim uh you know spoke of Thea
[2:29:33] Revival but you
[2:29:35] see these men were men of
[2:29:39] prayer men of prayer men and women of
[2:29:43] prayer we need a
[2:29:45] Revival we need a Revival in our lives
[2:29:50] you see if we prayed like some of the
[2:29:52] denominations
[2:29:54] pray we would have been very far because
[2:29:57] the bride
[2:29:58] Revival is not only the Revival of the
[2:30:02] word but it is also the Revival of the
[2:30:06] power let us stand on our feet we warm
[2:30:09] up and go to prayer this is the time
[2:30:12] where you feel
[2:30:14] tired where the Devil comes to begin
[2:30:16] smiting the musici can
