nairi uh and is going to minister the service this morning amen and uh so I'll just uh take these announcements out of the way and then we receive the word so uh two three things here to uh brother and before the announcements when I turned this side a Noti I had forgotten to announce sister Charity's visit as well sister charity God bless you if someone doesn't Rush she's our next M here yeah but if someone rushes and goes beyond then maybe you will steal the blessing amen amen so um as um a father and a pastor to and Sh on their behalf I would like to really appreciate you the church for standing with us you know different people did different things God bless you so much amen sh and will appreciate you in details yeah brother Prince has been with us for uh for four months ever since he um came to visit us is been and let's see two conventions the youth meetings and then the Easter conv vention Easter what which one is the third oh there was another weekend challenge okay yes then weekend challenge so three meetings he attended as well as he has also been uh in many weddings you know how many weddings you've been in come come up here so uh several weddings but um this week this week he has also ministered many places the last week he was in um um you're going to forget my sluggishness I'm a bit tired so he was inia and also he has been in um uh in Zana and he ministered here as well but it has come to time when he's now going to return back home but since you have been in many weddings I hope you have tapped the anointing and the next time we see you let us hear good news so before you go I'd like you to tell these people how bad they have been to you if they have been bad but if they have been good appreciate them and then for just about two minutes then God bless you hallelujah hallelujah I'd like to thank you greatly for the opportunity to get to meet you and to get to know you uh a lot of times you think you are in a certain place and you are the only one like Elijah who thought that he was the only Prophet who was left told there so when you are in Zimbabwe you only think that the bride is in zimb but then when you get to travel you see a lot of other Saints who are part of the Bride who believe the same message its total it gives you hope that this indeed is nothing but the truth I would like to thank you greatly I know when I came here I was coming to a people who had their own programs but I would like to thank you for going out of your way to make me feel comfortable [Music] some when they were supposed to be doing different deals and different things they would try to adjust so that I that means a lot may God richly bless you and I hope that we will meet again one way or the other if it is not on the side of the river we are going to meet again beyond the CST but this is the enest of our Salvation that we meet to part and we part to meet again may the good Lord bless you rich and may He put more where you removed and may he give you the possessions that are yours in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Applause] amen sister Anna I forgot to announce sister Anna as well where is she right in the back here lift up your hand have

in the family Ministry where he he's been the associate pastor brother Gideon so it's uh if it is sad for them it is also sad for us and especially my family related with him as well yeah so that goes

to change the word of God has power to transform this is our expectation this morning Ephesians chapter 1 we'll read uh from verse 1 to 7 I will read some other scriptures but we [Music] will shall we bow down our heads for prayer before precious heavenly father I stand behind the sa desk Lord standing before me are your children Lord Lord the pches of your blood your sacred Church your lord and as I open your sacred word Lord knowing Heavenly Father we can be able to flip through the pages of this Bible but it has to take your Holy Spirit ministering to us Lord that that word can have an effect Lord you come down may your Holy Spirit anoint the speaker Lord even as I stand together with my interpreter here Lord anoint even the hearers of your word Lord Jesus Christ your word shall go forth in power to have an impact in our lives to bring about the desired change spirit of God move sweep over us this moment to bring about life Lord anything that is dead Lord Jesus bring about a resurrection Father Here we are in another Easter morning we commit ourselves unto you have your own way father this we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen Ephesians chapter 1 verse 1 to7 Bible says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in you're praying for blessings it's already done but the only way you can access this blessings if you are in Christ any other blessing that is outside of Christ it's going to ruin you the Bible says the blessings of the Lord they make rich and they add no sorrow so the kind of blessings that we want today are the blessings that we received when we were in Christ so let us go back in Christ and seek the blessing that we received when we according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so we were chosen before the foundation of the world and you are chosen to be holy you are chosen to be blameless you are chosen to walk before him in love Abraham was told by God walk before me and be th perfect Jesus told the disciples be perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and you might ask how can I I am man a young woman inala how can I living in the in the street of Cala be able to be perfect I am facing Temptations right left and Center brother you are chosen to be perfect you are chosen to be holy you are chosen to be blameless let us go back to that place where this things can be possible the problem is we are unplugged we are unplugged from the source of our blessings we are unpluged from the source of our joy we are unpluged from the source of our happiness we are unpluged from the source of our peace but let us go back for we were chosen in Christ amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his [Music] will the prayer of not by Will but then be done does not only apply when you're going through the valley of the shadow of death sir it also applies to your Perfection it applies to your Redemption it applies to your restoration it applies all the way around not my will be to the praise of of the glory of his grace wherein he have made has accepted in the [Music] Beloved in whom we have red through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen you can have your seat praise the name of the Lord Jesus I request that you pray for me let's let's forget other things be really focused on the word of God right now soak ourselves in his presence I want to speak about this morning for a subject um I'll be speaking about God's elective love God's elective love you know it's usually said sometimes in this season you know when there engagements and weddings and all these things you know they say that love is in the air I think maybe I'm not so far off as we talk about God's elective love today and I want to use these words for my text I choose you we are talking about God's elective and we'll get to see it father and father but I'll be focusing on I choose you and this I is not brother Ken standing before you you know I'm just a servant of the Lord I'm just a prisoner to Christ and today it has fallen upon me actually I have nothing need to bring I just be moving somewh between Genesis to Revelation so if this is the first time being in the service not try to wonder what is this person trying to talk about so fear not I just bring a love letter from your groom and he was his bride it is not my letter to you it is his letter to you the only thing that happened it it fell upon me to be the one to read it today on Wednesday will be the other time it will be it will be it will be another brother brother martin brother another brother it is not their letter but it's a letter from Jesus to his bride so I do not have any words to tell you brother I do not have any words to tell you but I'm just a mouthpiece that is repeating what he has already said so let us remember we are hearing what he has said so if I tell you now let me tell you something this thing is very serious when two people are in brother Bram says that the Bible is God's love story to his church you don't have to be smart to understand the Bible you have to have a humble heart and this love story it has been hid from the scholars in the world and it is only known by one thing yesterday we were hearing that the secret of of of the couples you know that have been married 20 30 40 years the secret was the knees brother Bram is telling us the only way you can be able to understand the love story is not by theology but by neology brother sister I want to tell you the things that you're going to hear in today if you've been someone that has been on your knees calling to the Lord don't speak to me on that service I am going to your house speak to me you are going to hear from your he is known by neology and when two people are in love people in a relationship you can tell your wife get that thing get that thing put it in that place and give it to a certain brother and other thing that I put there you take it and give it to the sister you that are hearing what I'm saying it is Greek to you it is Greek to you it is French to you but to my wife she knows what I'm talking about because before I left the house there's this thing here there's this thing here there's this thing here and that is how it is between Christ and the pride he has hid these things from the wise and the pr and brother Bram would say when he was away in meeting the wife would write letter you know dear you know I'm sitting in the house here I'm writing you this letter it's been a very long day just put the kids to sleep brother Bram says that he can be able to read in between the lines he can be able to hear or read what the wife is not telling him why they're in Fellowship maybe that time if brother Bram was home after the K have been put to sleep maybe that is the time that sit honey love you so much do you remember the day that we got married brother sh let never never let a day go by before you sit down with your wife and tell her that you love her tell her how beautiful she is every married man in the house you have a responsibility what are you doing you having secret communication you're having Fellowship so brother Bram would say I am able to read between the lines I am in love with my wife but someone that is not in love with their wife they have no clue they have no idea and if you're not in love with Jesus if you do not take time to go through his letter understand what he's saying some of these things will be passing you but now now we want to read in between the lines we want to understand yes we go through so many things we will go through trials and temp but I've come with a message my brother God today Jesus today is saying regardless of anything regardless of everythingoes get this off now 1 we want to read in between the lines right first Peter 1: 2 say elect according to the four knowledge of God the Father elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father someone else he says to the elect lady brother sister who's this elect lady she's the one that I'm standing before today elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit and to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace to you and peace be multiplied do you know something brother you are the elect of God you are the elect lady that Jesus chose you and in Romans chapter 8 he says this and he know that all things work together for good to them that love God catch these words now not to them who are called to them who are they called there's a category of people that are called the C that are called The Chosen that are called the elect Hallelujah are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also Justified I want you introduced to you another name of this group they called the justifi and whom he justify he also glorify I want to give you another they also called glorified it's a finished Ro brother it's a finished Ro sister I finished work in Christ Jesus and he says what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son that delivered him up for us all now I want us to draw a line today let's read this and then we shall We Shall We Shall zero on it as we go on but deliver him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things and then a question is asked here who shall lay anything to the charge of God's El it is God that justif I want to tell you something brother you are an elect it is God that justifies you it is God that is working on you brother sister I want to bring you to your realization where you get to see that you're living out a pre life Hallelujah Jesus did come to die you know he just came to die so whosoever will believe let them believe no sir it was for a purpose it was for a reason of let me read it for you me read it for you so that you believe it brother Bram says that God does not run his business like that he didn't just come to die up hazly he had a purpose he had a reason it was not just happening out of chance I think it's right here all right he says this God's covenant with Abraham he says now notice God when Satan done this evil thing here's what I think of God that he knew right then what will be the entire plan that he would use to bring man back to himself you know when the fall happened Adam had sinned Eve had oh Satan knew this is it God you kick me out of heaven and thought you going to make Jes God God but little did he know the jokes on you because what did God do he went and took saints Saints there's something I really want to bring I want you to help me now I want you to help me something needs to get home today so this is what happened there's a circle of Eternity you are a part of that eternity it's a circle it's a circle but now sin entered the world When sin entered the world a piece of that Circle broke when a piece of that Circle broke it came from eternity and dropped hallelujah amen look at it like this is a Son of God he fell do you know what happened he did not lose the designation of a Son of God he was a Son of God in a fallen condition so what does he become a fallen Son of God brother you are a son of God you are a daughter of God your situation does not change who you are it might change your name not change who you are you might be a fallen son of Son of God but still the predominant thing the denominator I am a Son of God a daughter of God chosen [Music] so the portion of the circle time it didn't change it was still a part of the CLE was still a part of the C hallelujah hallelujah you are not a creature of time passing time you're a creature of Eternity going through time you are not a man from Uganda and and that is why I am bringing a Reb if you did not come to church today because of the rain because you thought as Pastor was saying that you're going to melt you're taking the the scripture so liter and God formed man out of the ground that is the part you want to hold on to that you are formed out of the ground so you this body where do you come from my brother I come from Lake Victoria Islands this is soil from Lake Victoria but hidden in this flesh hidden in this flesh there is something that came from eternity there is something that came from God you did not come to church because of the challenge you today says you will not get anything from God without sacrifice forgive me if I'm going to be an evangelist I was telling Pastor that his last previous sermons have been very fiery they've been really really fir so I think I'm we can't go like this we cannot go on like this we cannot say that we've received a message that is going to change these bodies and it is these bodies keeping in our houses now I understand even if you do not invite me again fine there might be some reasons but I want to ask you is that a reason that if Jesus was coming to preach here would he we need to stop Jing we are not ugandans we are not ugandans so stop behaving like Uganda you are children of the most high God [Music] how do you expect the people in this area to be bringing people that are dying on their Death Beds for you to come and pray for them to rise up again they will come and find that nobody came to church because it was and we supposed to have a Ministry like that of Jesus the days of Jesus Christ wherever Jesus was they were actually removing the roofs we are not ugandans we are sons of God living in Uganda after our purpose in Uganda so let us stop behaving like ug ug spirit kick it out even in matters of traditions we do not want ugan tradition we are not transferring Ugandan Traditions to our children forgive me I didn't mean to say you know when we sitting down you know as ug how we do you and who else El you else let ugandans deal like ugandans sons of God deal like sons of God another generation we must know who we are we must know that we chosen know that we are called we are the elect we are the Justified we are it's no longer business as usual now we are knowing where we are we are a part of that Circle that came we are a part of that CLE amen this is what happened brother Bram says somewhere and he says this brother Bram he says I see let's read it we'll go back to my quote remember thank you so much for those that are flowing with me in the spirit thank you oh my feel so much wonderful so we see devil had come oh God the jokes on you these people that you think you're going to have another kingdom and God you actually said you've given him Dominion you've given him Authority you've made him a ruler of all the Flesh and I was just walking up and about naming the animals but now he has fallen God jokes on you he was there the other day telling this tree that was it seemed as if it was in the wrong place was operating the creation was bowing to him God jokes on you oh god oh jokes on you it is finished I've destroyed heaven and youve brought me on Earth I've also destroyed it and God is just [Music] there he's wondering what am I going to do and you see God he does not change his mind about his a moment you'll do that you shall surely die God was bound by his word he goes to Adam you know you know what Adam does blames it on the woman woman blames it on the do you realize something God never turned to The Serpent and asked the serpent why he did what he did what happens judgment strikes and then he turns to Adam you know what I'm going to do now this is so painful but he takes a lamb he takes a lamb and slays the L and it takes the clothes the skin allow me to paraphrase it because of time puts it on them and brother say and I want you to catch this words preparation and then when I see Adam as it was standing there and the beautiful St of her and while she's standing there these old bloody ship skins the blood of the ship skins running down God standing there pronouncing death destruction watch then I can see Eve put her lovely head over on Adam's this is a prophet when we read the message we said we are reading in between the lines right when brother Bram says I see a figment of his imagination this is an exodus an e as SE is opening up as he's saying I can see it is not thought on his head a sin is opening up before remember Moses wrote about Abraham he wrote about Genesis 1 and he says in the beginning God created Moses was was not in the beginning Moses was an eagle he could go back and we see something that's the Old Testament in the New Testament we find another E Matthew is the lion Matthew is the lion Matthew is the lion Matthew Mark Luke and John Matthew is Li and Then followed by and Then followed by Luke and then John Matthew Mark Luke and John the lion the ox the face of a man and an E look at the way John writes the gospel there is something different John among all the writers is the only one that could bring the of Jesus Christ as a lion portray him as a king king of the we are reading the Bible a frh the Bible has become a new book so an E when he says in the beginning he does not par Moses he qu Moses but he does not par Moses Elijah but does not part Elijah we are EOS we are not pars we set our wings and we fly and the higher we go better we able to see went higher what did he see in the beginning God created what did John see in the beginning hallelujah amen praise the Lord so when we have another Prophet that is right here and he says that I see this is not a fragment of his imagination he could see this is why mes wrot about that's why he wrote about Abraham he wrote about and evees wasn't there but he could see oh brother sister that was a first Exodus we've also received another Exodus [Music] Prophet when he says he sees listen carefully because there's something right there and what time he looked what did he see he saw that the wife of zakas was called Rebecca praise God this are not just story say and then I can see he put her lovely [Music] head and and him put his arms around her they started weeping turned around and started walking out of his presence God depart from him he had sinned and there is your judgment when I can hear so he could also hear going down along that path through the garden of something like this what is it blood sh skins slapping on Adam's leg as he went down the ship skins against Adam's legs what is happening they walking out of the presence of God says let me tell you something each and everything in the spoken word each and everything in the message is there for a reason remember that sound and he says then I could see all that great spess eternity coming forming down like a funnel to four little words four little words l o children so much he couldn't turn them away then I hear him say stop I'll put anity seat what is God doing promising a Redemption he's making a preparation for a Redemption let's go to another message God's provided approach to Divine fellow this is what he says and I can see now I hear an old something bumping over the [Music] streets going out towards Calvary and as I look there was a little fellow the B said there was no beauty that we should desire him he had a cross on his shoulders and the blood stried across his back there was a mocking crown on on his face and they had spot on him and done all these and he says this as he starts up that mountain I see his garments just socked in blood splashing against the sides of his leg the first scenario the first scenario is the first Adam the second scenario second Adam there's one thing that is there there's a sound there's a sound the circle of Eternity has been broken it is coming falling into time that is Adam moving out of the presence of God the circle is broken that small piece coming down but the slapping sound there but now we see something else brother says I see his garments just soaked in blood previously God took a physical but now here comes one when he was washed at River Jordan the prophet made a declaration behold the lamp of God away the so now Adam had been covered with ship but now was the second ad the L of God himself Saints all that you need in this life is finished everything that you need it is finished what am I saying brother Jesus is that perfect sacrifice amen so he comes down the small piece of Eternity has fallen down and we are seeing another one the perfect L of God clothes Zing blood say that I want you to take it and describe it in your heart you know many times we struggle with so many things and this is simply because we do not understand did for us we don't understand what Calvary did for us I see his garments just socked splashing against the side of his leg a sight that no man that ever know what that meant could look and Saints I want to give you the secret of living an overcoming life you know sometimes we we can be confused when you preach when you preach a hard message this brother is legalist when you preach a soft message they tell you that oh brother you're not getting seen first of all I want you to understand message is hard whether it is soft I have no heaven to take you I have no heaven to if it is hard praise the Lord if it is soft praise the Lord but the bottom line is I have to tell you what the word of God say so if the Bible says you're the elect lady I have to tell you what the Bible calls you how you interpret it that's up to you but one thing my Prophet is telling me you cannot look at that site and know what it means and yet remain the same so if your life has been the same you need to go back to Calvary you need to get to understand what it means this is what it means brother the first Adam came down but now that piece of Eternity came down to time has to be restored back and now if something is broken there has to be glue that reconnects the what is this glue the thing that God used in the time was the blood of the L but now here comes the perfect sacrifice Adam had fallen and after Adam had fallen Jesus Christ came he condescended even lower than the Angels what was he coming to do he was coming to take that pie and as he's caring the cross he's going back Adam came from there with blood against Jesus is choosing you is choosing you and is speaking you with why is it taking you to reconnect you you came from Hallelujah brother why do you understand that you can never be the same again listen Saints Jesus did not come to die he knew what he was doing that's why John 3:16 God so loved that he gave his only that whosoever he does not say whosoever believes on him whoever believes in him those that were in him those that were in him those that were part of that Circle believe Hallelujah you're not understand you're not believing the message now Hallelujah let me give you one thing amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus says this message question and answers of 9 he chose us in love before the found and having predestinated us and to the adoption of children and he says what about that brother Mike isn't that wonderful is it it wonderful to know that he chose you wonderful to know that he predestinated and he says this he loved you he loved you before there was a world before there was a wild before you were born by your parents he loved you before your parents were even born he you before Oh My Hallelujah before your grandfather was born he led you before there was a Hallelujah why amen you are part of that Circle you are part of Eternity I don't care what the devil tells you Satan I am hallelujah hallelujah Satan has no power over you who came first Satan who came first who came first I am here to stay he loved you before there was a word he your nature do you have temper do you have something that you're do you have a problem in your life he knew your your your struggles amen he know your weaknesses those things that the devil preaches to you day and night they knew them God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah you're too late my God he know your habits what are you struggling with today something that has been oppressing you God knew it God knew it you realize knew it will never remain the same Hallelujah he know all about you what he was going to be and then when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said he you Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah he made why I am the chosen I am the I Am The Bride of Jesus hallelujah praise the name of the Lord it doesn't matter what has the devil been preaching to you that you're a loser you're a failure I want you to turn back to the gods my failure God knew my weaknesses God knows my short and despite all he says brother that's God's elective love that is God's elective love that is God's elective [Music] love amen he would have chosen he would have chosen this piece of Eternity has come down to time I let them go and these two ends that are remaining it have complet Adam left the presence of God he was weeping oh my what was going to happen you know what had happened at that time here was ad was Eve Eve was already judged and condemn but you see Adam the Bible says Adam did not sin Adam was not beged was not deceived but you see Adam had a choice to let go and Adam would have remained with God but what did Adam [Music] do at that point preached to God [Music] hallelujah oh I do not care it does not matter know this is father when we were having our wedding you know remember that River and the weather was so and the tree of life was standing and you know I vowed that you're born I said that I love you through there was nothing such as still death do us I said I love you I didn't know the pastor who is [Music] godam shall leave God because God was the father Hallelujah God is bound by his own word brother so if Adam would have chosen to remain with god of the world have the same word commanded you must leave father and you must leave me who is your and CLE unto your so as Adam is telling actually at this time saying you know what honey I choose you okay my father my mother he going hallelujah hallelujah but you see he's living but now God knew one thing a type the way that Adam chose his wife let's look at what brother Bram says love the Lord Jesus says this [Music] church let us examine this first phrase as many as I love this was now the message to the ludan church in the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I he does not say as many would feel he should say he does not say the way many other people would want him to say and what other people would want him to say is instead of as many as I love is instead to say as many as Love Me Now what people want God to say they want God to say as many as love me that is not what God says God says as many as I God love so I want you to get that distinction it's not about if you love God the question here is as many as God chooses as many as God justifies many as God call that is why they are called I hope you understand that praise the name of the Lord Jesus and we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours are you catching what I'm saying you remember that story brother you know he's there and you know he'd left some meetings he'd been away for some time Rebecca and S the little girls were waiting for him unfortunately he arrived later and early the next morning he had gone and sat somewhere outside and Rebecca who's the eldest happened to wake up and you Dad out she was running and as she was running toward fortunately or unfortunately happened to Star Sarah as she was sleeping so what happened is Sarah woke up and she sleep what happened and you see Rebecca does not even tell her sister where she's going s justone and then Sarah catches a revelation she looks outside daddy's outside and she also follows and he said brother put like this Saints this are not stor the way we read the message is not like how we read the newspaper in between the lines the stories that brother Bram gives these are Parables do you believe that he was the son of man he was a son of man these are The Parables of a son of when we read the message we want to cut the message in a message praise the name of the Lord Jesus so you seeca is a little bit older so she can be able to run faster but you see sah is the she's a little bit smaller and at the same time you know how it is with families hand me downs I don't know how you call them here hand me downs the clothes of the elders so the clothes that Sarah was wearing actually a bit bigger was but eventually they all arrived buta arrived first and by the time Sarah is getting there you see Rebecca is all over the place and you know he's really she's really feeling herself and then turns to the turns to the sister and says ohcc I'm sorry Rebecca says to SAR I'm sorry you're too late I'm sorry there's no space for you I have all of that and you know how little girls sometimes are very emotional and she felt so sad brother bham catches extends the leg to sah and ask Sarah comes sits on the now there's also something here Sarah is tall so her feet able to reach the ground and she's very stable but unfortunately for for for Sarah she's a bit wobbly and here she has already been told I have all of daddy but then when brother Bram sees he holds her and secures her family and after some time Sarah turns to the sister my dear sister you know you're actually right you have a of dadd but can I tell you something Daddy Daddy has all of me that's what we are talking about that story of that girl knew the king but the king didn't know her so breaking but can we find joy can we find Comfort let's finish with this here praise the name of the Lord Jesus and he says so once again we find ourselves gloring in his salvation purpose and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignity of God even as he said in Romans 9:13 Jacob have I loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn n to him by no means is this so so he also declared in Romans 9:13 es have I hated and in verse 11 Spirit Bly calls out for the children not being born nether having done any good that the purpose of God according to election not of works but of him that call this love is elective love it is his love elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit it says that the purpose of God stands in amen which is exactly opposite to works or anything that man has in he says something here and he see there are some people that couldn't figure out God's love for them and they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that and he says this the proof of his love is election you can read that in the simanian Church AG that the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto [Music] salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did with Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign that it isol with a purpose since if you're going through trials if you're going through Temptations and you know that you are the elect of God you go about it differently it does not matter how comes your way you know that your eternity is secure we sing this song I love him I love him because hallelujah amen now we can sing I Choose You I choose you because you fast CH so today I stand like Daniel with a purpose in my heart I choose not to defile myself amen God never went halfway with you he never went halfway with why are you going halfway with you went all the way as a matter of fact he went to the deepest part of you know what took him to the Cross you took him to the Cross do you know what kept him on the cross the moment they started spting on him I would have said enough is enough but he chose Hallelujah they put a th of crowns on his head ah this is as I can but he [Music] brother sister it was not three Nails two on the hands and one on that it was three words what did that make him do he chose me and at the end of it all he said it is finished amen praise the name of the Lord let us stand up on our feet Oh Glory to God hallelujah brother sister he chose God chose you do you understand what that means do you understand what that means brother Bram say something here I had a lot of quotations but just allow me he says this seem to have lost it you know many times people confuse and said that because I was predestinated I can do whatever I want you can't do whatever you want you are chosen for a purpose you are chosen for a reason there was this man by the name of of of there was this young man that was driving a car one time and he got to a certain place and the castle of broke down he tried to adjust few things there and there but nothing seems and then after some time there came a very a very classic you know a rich man stepped out of it a man that was well dressed came and asked him what's the problem my car can't seem to stop and he asked him can I have a look and he went and popped the trunk and start made a few adjustments and then know he told him why don't you start it and he started the car and it started he Reed the engine and he stepped the car he didn't even switch it off because he was fearing that it might go off again and stepped out and asked what did you do and this man said I cannot stand and watch any one of my creations not perform what I manufactured it to perform I didn't get [Music] it know who this man was this man was Henry Ford a vehicle manufacturer that saw one of his vehicles on the streets like and if such a rich man could have a lot of affection for his own work how about you and I Ephesians chter 3 for we are his workmanship Philippians chter one he that started at good work God will not sit down and watch you fail sit down you up Hallelujah brother Bram says this now notice Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for aard well I'll die up there and perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved no no no no no no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus come for one specific purp that was to redeem those that God for would be redeemed now God is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repent but in order to be God he had to know and he says in speaking of predestination the people sometimes Le to that God just predestinated you to push you through a little pipe or something that's not right destination looks back to for a knowledge knowledge looks to Des my brother my sister you have a choice to make this afternoon he has already made his choice as you sing that song I have decided to follow you he has already chosen you the love letter that I've been reading to you about today he's just been telling you that I chose you every person that is here today we all know this story as I finish now this young man there was this Ranch somewhere and the father was the president of thatch [Music] company you can get the s secret going away of the church and you see the son was coming to visit the ranch and people didn't know this but actually the son was looking for a wife his intention he was looking for someone to marry he'd come from the city all the women there were had painted leaves and painted all these cosmetics you know beauty that is very superficial when he arrived in the ranch the same same thing that he found there were some ladies there some and they also dressed the same way with an intention that they were desing to get married to the son they if you get married to the son we become an air to everything and I want to tell you something Jesus is also on a mission and this Mission he's looking for a particular thing that little piece of Eternity that is what he came to look for and if you're not a part of [Applause] that I'm sorry my brother my sister I have no good news for you but if you've heard the word tonight if you've had the message you've heard from your theop there's something that is identifying you you need to make a choice and the young man came and that time they were holding a party he looked all around oh brother he looked around your how many of us here their parents do not even believe the message fathers do not even believe they do not have relatives that he chose you he left all the rest and went out of the party room and somewhere back there there was a kitchen and there was a little girl that was doing some clean and Jesus looking around all the churches looking around all the homes looking for a wife looking for a bride that is clean you see this guy was always about washing the pants and utensils Jesus is looking there such a bride that says I'm going to stay right under the blood she's looking for a prde that is coming to the service that is being washed By the Waters of [Music] the and this is the thing he gave his promise to the little girl and I just want to ask you this brother put it here he gave the promise to the God but the man went back but you see he had already given his word to the God and after that man left it was the duty of the god to keep herself to prepare and make ready based on the choice that the man had made she was working day and night up the little money that she sure that she gets the dress So when he comes he comes he will find me ready Saints Jes Jesus has already chosen you but there's a work that you must and he says so he threw herself in his arms that time when the man came and he said darling I have had a man stationed on this Ranch since I last year and he's brought me a of everything that you've done and he continues to say God has got a man stationed in this temp he is called the Holy Spirit he knows the secrets of your heart he knows everything that you've done or what you think he tells the father everything [Music] have you been faithful to that choice you see she was ready she had lived and been the kind of woman that he had [Music] wanted every head bowed as he sing that song
