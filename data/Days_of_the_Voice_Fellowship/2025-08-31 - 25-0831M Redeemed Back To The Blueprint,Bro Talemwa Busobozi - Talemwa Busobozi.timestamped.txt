[1:20:05] inspiration you've given me this morning

[1:20:53] of your word
[1:20:56] and even those that are not able to be

[1:20:59] Lord our sister Esther
[1:21:02] sent in a prayer request Lord

[1:21:39] Amen. Give the Lord a clap of praise.
[1:21:44] God bless. God bless you all. God bless
[1:21:46] musicians.
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:50] We turn uh to our Bibles this morning
[1:21:55] to the book of Genesis.
[1:22:01] Verse chapter 1 vers 26.
[1:22:20] If you're there, you say amen.
[1:22:27] I take it that you are not yet there.
[1:22:31] When you get there, say amen. Then I
[1:22:32] know you are.
[1:22:35] Okay. If you are there and if you don't
[1:22:38] have Bibles,
[1:22:40] please buy a Bible.
[1:22:42] If you can't afford one, we'll help you.
[1:22:46] But meanwhile, you can maybe follow the
[1:22:48] screen.
[1:22:50] Uh chapter Genesis 1.
[1:22:55] Amen.
[1:22:57] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:23:01] image, after our likeness, and let them
[1:23:04] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:23:07] and over the f of the air, and over the
[1:23:09] cattle, and over all the earth, and over
[1:23:12] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:23:14] the earth." So God created man in his
[1:23:17] own image, in the image of God created
[1:23:20] he him. Male and female created he them.
[1:23:24] And God blessed them and and and and
[1:23:26] said unto them, "Be fruitful, and
[1:23:27] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[1:23:30] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[1:23:32] fish of the sea, and over the fall of
[1:23:34] the air, and over every living thing
[1:23:36] that moveth upon the earth.
[1:23:46] Foreign
[1:23:54] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:21] Amen. So this man was created in the
[1:24:23] image of what?
[1:24:30] Which image? Church.
[1:24:34] Have we come to church this morning?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; In whose image?
[1:24:40] God bless you. Now let us look at
[1:24:42] Genesis chapter 2
[1:24:46] vers 7.
[1:24:48] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[1:24:51] of the ground and breathed into his
[1:24:52] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:24:54] became a living soul.
[1:25:05] So, how did he form him?
[1:25:10] I'm expecting answers
[1:25:14] out of the
[1:25:16] dust of the ground.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And the Lord God formed uh
[1:25:20] planted a garden eastward in Eden. And
[1:25:23] there he put the man whom he had formed.
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:37] Vers 15.
[1:25:39] And the Lord God took the man and put
[1:25:41] him into the garden of Eden to dress it
[1:25:43] and to keep it. And the Lord God
[1:25:45] commanded the man, saying, of every tree
[1:25:47] of the garden, thou mayest freely eat,
[1:25:49] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:25:52] evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in
[1:25:54] the day that thou eat it thereof, thou
[1:25:55] shalt surely die. And the Lord God said,
[1:25:58] "It is not good that a man should be
[1:26:00] alone, and I will make him an help for
[1:26:02] him.
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:25] So now the man of Genesis 1, we notice
[1:26:28] that he's in the image of God.
[1:26:33] But you see, he's is um he's a spirit
[1:26:36] man, as we will see.
[1:26:40] And then the man of Genesis 2
[1:26:44] is now a formation
[1:26:47] formed out of the ground and then he is
[1:26:50] given rules to follow.
[1:26:54] But then he had
[1:26:56] he was a free moral agent.
[1:26:59] He could do choose to obey what God said
[1:27:03] or not to. It was a choice.
[1:27:07] Then now we see man in Genesis 3
[1:27:13] 19.
[1:27:17] In a sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:27:22] till thou return unto the ground. For
[1:27:24] out of out of it was thou taken. For
[1:27:27] dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
[1:27:29] return.
[1:27:43] So we see now in Genesis 1, this is a
[1:27:46] created man
[1:27:49] in the image of God. And then Genesis 2,
[1:27:52] we see this is a dust man
[1:27:55] formed out of the ground. And Genesis 3,
[1:27:59] we see that this is fallen man.
[1:28:04] and uh uh you know we'll we'll be able
[1:28:06] to uh talk much about these things.
[1:28:11] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:14] Genesis 1,
[1:28:17] created man in the image of God.
[1:28:19] Genesis 2, dust man not fallen.
[1:28:25] Genesis 3, dust man
[1:28:29] fallen.
[1:28:31] May God bless bless the reading of his
[1:28:33] word.
[1:28:35] You may be seated please.
[1:28:37] And I want to greet each and every one
[1:28:39] of you
[1:28:41] in the much uh precious name of our Lord
[1:28:44] Jesus Christ.
[1:28:46] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:28:48] Lord?
[1:28:50] I see a lot of people behind with no
[1:28:51] seats.
[1:28:54] We have some seats here so the deacons
[1:28:57] may want.
[1:29:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Just before we get into the word, I
[1:29:03] wanted to let you know
[1:29:05] that Sister Rose lost a brother, a
[1:29:08] brother.
[1:29:11] So I she she informed me when I was very
[1:29:16] busy and not I did not have time to
[1:29:17] inform.
[1:29:22] You know we have a way that when one of
[1:29:23] us loses somebody
[1:29:27] the brothers and sisters try to believe
[1:29:30] with them.
[1:29:33] So even if you're not able to go but at
[1:29:35] least if you can send a message or
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:40] is always encouraging
[1:29:42] when you know you have a family that has
[1:29:44] your back.
[1:29:47] Amen. A spiritual family.
[1:29:50] and also sister Esther.
[1:29:53] She's um you know having an issue with
[1:29:56] her health
[1:29:58] and she asked that we remember her.
[1:30:02] Brother Marvin, you have the pictures.
[1:30:04] Yeah. Uh yes. Um I think it was Tuesday.
[1:30:08] We had a a a baptism a mega baptism
[1:30:11] service
[1:30:14] and um we had a few who I also
[1:30:17] understand there are some who wanted to
[1:30:18] be baptized.
[1:30:21] But it has they were not they either did
[1:30:23] not know on time
[1:30:25] or were not able to make it. Is that
[1:30:28] sister one of those?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sister Beatric. Where is she?
[1:30:33] Oh, right over here. Please let us
[1:30:36] welcome sister Beatric.
[1:30:39] God bless you, sister Beatric
[1:30:41] all the way from
[1:30:43] and she's I think a workmate of brother
[1:30:46] Julius
[1:30:48] and unfortunately she was not able to
[1:30:49] make it for the baptism service
[1:30:53] she also wants to be baptized.
[1:30:56] Amen. Amen. It used to be in in our days
[1:31:00] when we hear that someone wants to be
[1:31:01] baptized
[1:31:03] everybody would be excited
[1:31:05] because we understood what it meant.
[1:31:08] But I don't know your generation is
[1:31:09] different. We are saying someone wants
[1:31:12] to be baptized.
[1:31:13] People are just shaking.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'm saying someone who wants to be
[1:31:17] baptized.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's a wonderful thing.
[1:31:22] Yes.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; The day I decided to be baptized,
[1:31:26] people were like 10 in the church.
[1:31:29] But the noise was like over 100.
[1:31:32] I was like, is it a big?
[1:31:36] So, it it kind of encourages the person
[1:31:40] and uh so yeah, can we dim the lights a
[1:31:43] little bit, brothers?
[1:31:47] This um I hope that you have them,
[1:31:49] brother Dan, as well online.
[1:31:57] Yeah. Can you dim a little more, brother
[1:31:59] Shem?
[1:32:01] Okay, I hope you can see.
[1:32:04] You see the brother who is standing
[1:32:05] right there in the middle of everybody.
[1:32:10] Well, you need to have a seat,
[1:32:12] but he wanted to make sure he hears
[1:32:14] everything I said.
[1:32:17] Now, we know that a person that is to be
[1:32:19] baptized
[1:32:22] must be someone that has reached the age
[1:32:24] of accountability.
[1:32:28] But we do not know personally I do not
[1:32:30] know the age of accountability.
[1:32:34] Uganda says it is 18.
[1:32:36] Um as some other countries say it is 17.
[1:32:41] But u I believe that God has his age of
[1:32:44] accountability much lower than that.
[1:32:50] As as far as you can hear
[1:32:53] and refuse to believe
[1:32:55] or hear and believe.
[1:32:58] you have reached that age
[1:33:00] and um so um um my daughter my first
[1:33:05] daughter baptized I think it was seven
[1:33:06] years
[1:33:09] when she really asked me and pressed me
[1:33:13] I said well let's go for it and I think
[1:33:16] the second one as well
[1:33:18] Sharon came once
[1:33:21] I told her you're not ready so she never
[1:33:23] came back again and u then now eloo
[1:33:28] has been on my case for several months
[1:33:31] on and off
[1:33:33] but recently it became intense
[1:33:37] and for I think about three weeks
[1:33:41] every day in that period he has been
[1:33:45] waking up
[1:33:47] and asking me daddy are you going to
[1:33:48] baptize me today are you going to
[1:33:50] baptize me morning evening morning
[1:33:53] evening morning evening it's like he was
[1:33:55] just dreaming and thinking about it the
[1:33:56] whole
[1:33:58] And one time I asked him why do you want
[1:33:59] to be baptized?
[1:34:01] He said well I want to go to heaven but
[1:34:04] I also want to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:34:06] and and I also want to be a child of
[1:34:08] God.
[1:34:09] So um because you know he hears when we
[1:34:12] are preaching
[1:34:14] and he he wonders but I'm not baptized.
[1:34:17] So I thought maybe it's just young
[1:34:21] it will wear off but it kept on
[1:34:25] constant.
[1:34:26] So you can see what I'm talking about
[1:34:29] there. I did not know I I gave them a
[1:34:32] few pictures but I didn't
[1:34:34] when I saw this I remembered.
[1:34:37] You can see he was attentive
[1:34:39] listening to everything. After this
[1:34:42] little preaching,
[1:34:44] he came out with a question. Actually,
[1:34:47] you know, the people were many. So, he
[1:34:50] wanted to ask and then we went out
[1:34:52] before he asked.
[1:34:54] And then when we came out, his mom came
[1:34:56] and told me that he had a question. I
[1:35:00] said, "Oh, sorry. I did not know that
[1:35:02] you had a question." So, I don't
[1:35:04] remember the question you asked, but we
[1:35:06] went through it and
[1:35:08] and who was baptized
[1:35:11] At 5 years old,
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I was I was thinking he made a record.
[1:35:17] He made a record in our home.
[1:35:20] The youngest to be ever baptized.
[1:35:23] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:35:25] Amen. Amen. And uh uh also I think two
[1:35:29] children of brother Langa.
[1:35:32] One of them when they one of them had I
[1:35:34] was announcing we have a baptism
[1:35:35] service.
[1:35:38] One of them came right here.
[1:35:41] or from there up to here. And he was
[1:35:44] very bold. I
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; think brother Victor, where's brother
[1:35:46] Victor? Victor, right over here.
[1:35:50] He came, pastor, I want to be baptized.
[1:35:53] And he was very serious.
[1:35:56] And so we had a little time with them
[1:35:57] and
[1:35:59] just to be sure it's not the parents
[1:36:00] telling them
[1:36:03] and it was their decision.
[1:36:05] So if a child decides,
[1:36:08] here's the word.
[1:36:10] leaves the world, decides,
[1:36:13] then the child is ready.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; With the children today
[1:36:19] with in this generation being so young
[1:36:23] doing things you can't even believe they
[1:36:24] can.
[1:36:26] It shows we are living knowledge has
[1:36:28] increased.
[1:36:31] So even on the spiritual side, I believe
[1:36:34] God will call his
[1:36:37] and he will he will find them early.
[1:36:40] Amen. And and so yeah, you can see me
[1:36:44] there talking to the little ones.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; You can continue, brother.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:36:50] you only have a little photos today.
[1:36:54] So uh we we have uh I don't know who
[1:36:57] this sister is. Sister Patience. We're
[1:37:00] baptized. Is this the patients here
[1:37:02] today?
[1:37:06] Oh,
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; but I think you're not the one here.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Another sister. She's a patient. She's a
[1:37:13] sister that we met at the baptism place
[1:37:18] and uh she finally made a decision and
[1:37:21] she was baptized and you can see her
[1:37:23] here. She's very very senior.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:28] And also there's sister to uh uh sister
[1:37:32] Martha
[1:37:33] sister Grace. God bless you sister
[1:37:35] Grace.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And uh also brother David Bassim and his
[1:37:40] wife over here. God bless you so much.
[1:37:44] Amen. These were baptized before in the
[1:37:47] Pentecostal church
[1:37:50] but they wanted to do it in the correct
[1:37:51] way.
[1:37:53] Amen. Brother just give me all the
[1:37:55] pictures you have.
[1:37:57] every all the pictures all the pictures
[1:37:59] let's keep them rolling I think I've
[1:38:01] forgotten a few other sisters but we had
[1:38:02] several of them and
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; and it was a good time so allto together
[1:38:07] baptized nine people
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:17] are not for
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; amen so this morning
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; uh I'm going to speak on redeemed back
[1:38:26] to the blueprint
[1:38:34] I forgot but I was supposed to bring a
[1:38:36] blueprint
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; of a building because there are some
[1:38:42] people who don't Are you one of them?
[1:38:44] They don't understand what a blueprint
[1:38:45] is.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Blueprint.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I was supposed to bring to
[1:38:49] bring a blueprint.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; We call it a plan in Uganda.
[1:39:00] Yes. How many understand what I'm
[1:39:02] talking about?
[1:39:04] So, I was supposed to to bring it so I
[1:39:05] can spread it out to you,
[1:39:09] but I just it skipped my mind. So, but
[1:39:12] I'm speaking on redeemed back to the
[1:39:15] blueprint.

[1:39:44] bless you my sister. Uh I I did not
[1:39:47] know. So look with all these engineers
[1:39:51] their job well the other ones are also
[1:39:54] mechanical engineers brother. So just
[1:39:56] just make sure because the brothers may
[1:39:58] be offended for us butch they also
[1:40:02] engineers
[1:40:03] they are mechanical engineers.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Don't worry it's a language issue. So
[1:40:08] now an engineer
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; uh a structural engineer
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; will will be able to tell you know about
[1:40:17] the pillars and the structure of the
[1:40:19] building
[1:40:22] and then you know they will draw the
[1:40:23] whole uh diagram and
[1:40:27] how everything is going to look
[1:40:30] you know inside and outside.
[1:40:33] And uh you know now when someone comes
[1:40:36] later
[1:40:38] to build. We also call him engineer, but
[1:40:40] I don't know the right words.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that's the man.
[1:40:46] Now, when he comes to lay the bricks and
[1:40:47] to do everything
[1:40:49] to make the foundation and
[1:40:53] he does not do according to what he
[1:40:55] likes.
[1:40:57] He builds according to the blueprint.
[1:41:03] If it veers off,
[1:41:06] the owner of the building has a right
[1:41:09] to tell him to put everything down.
[1:41:13] It must be according to the plan.
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:17] So when I talk about the blueprint, I
[1:41:18] mean the plan.
[1:41:22] The father God had a plan
[1:41:26] for your life. Amen. He said, I know the
[1:41:30] plans I have for you.
[1:41:33] So you already made a plan
[1:41:36] before we came here
[1:41:39] and that plan cannot fail.
[1:41:44] We have to be redeemed back.
[1:41:48] But the way we were born, we were born
[1:41:52] fallen.
[1:41:53] So what you see today is not fully the
[1:41:57] plan or the blueprint that the father
[1:41:59] had.
[1:42:04] Now let us take this now scripturally.
[1:42:09] Amen. And uh just go with me this
[1:42:11] morning so that you do not miss
[1:42:15] and I do not know if I'll finish this
[1:42:16] thought today.
[1:42:19] But we shall see how the Holy Spirit
[1:42:20] will help us.
[1:42:23] Um look at Genesis the first scripture
[1:42:25] which we read.
[1:42:28] I'm still struggling with my sound
[1:42:29] brothers. So, first Genesis chapter 1
[1:42:33] 26.
[1:42:35] Are you there?
[1:42:38] Are we Bible believers? Church.
[1:42:41] So, let us get into our Bible.
[1:42:45] Amen. Genesis 1. Look at verse 26.
[1:42:50] And God said,
[1:42:52] "Let us Yeah, this is better brother
[1:42:54] shame. Let us make man in our image,
[1:42:58] after our likeness,
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:43:04] of the sea,
[1:43:06] and over the fall of the air, and over
[1:43:08] the cattle, and over all the y,
[1:43:13] and over every creeping thing that
[1:43:15] creepeth upon it.
[1:43:17] So God
[1:43:19] created man in his own image.
[1:43:26] in the image of God
[1:43:28] created he him.
[1:43:32] Now this was God's original thought or
[1:43:35] design
[1:43:39] that man was to be in his image.
[1:43:46] What was the image of God in
[1:43:48] the image of God if you want to to look
[1:43:50] at it in Genesis uh in John chapter 4
[1:43:56] today. Brother Marvin be
[1:43:59] very fast and try to put those
[1:44:00] scriptures for the people if you can.
[1:44:03] John chapter 4 vers 24 it says God is a
[1:44:13] my class today is a little dog.
[1:44:17] God is a
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:44:22] You know Sunday morning is usually Bible
[1:44:24] class.
[1:44:27] So let us enjoy the word.
[1:44:29] I want you to respond to me. I want to
[1:44:32] know your following.
[1:44:34] So God is a spirit
[1:44:36] and they that worship him must worship
[1:44:39] him in spirit
[1:44:41] and in truth.
[1:44:44] So God is a spirit. So to those who are
[1:44:47] saying God said let us make man.
[1:44:52] And therefore these was three gods,
[1:44:57] father, son, spirit. Each of them
[1:44:59] occupying a throne.
[1:45:02] Each of them a separate god.
[1:45:05] It defeats the very essence of God.
[1:45:09] Because God is a spirit
[1:45:12] and you cannot quantify a spirit.
[1:45:18] You cannot count a spirit.
[1:45:22] Spirit is
[1:45:25] um without end without beginning.
[1:45:29] Spirit cannot be closed in a bottle.
[1:45:35] So you cannot bottle God
[1:45:38] and say there is no other God.
[1:45:41] But God can be in this bottle
[1:45:43] but also be everywhere else.
[1:45:47] Amen. That's what it means for him to be
[1:45:51] omniresent.
[1:45:54] He is present in this bottle.
[1:45:57] Even when you go in hell, he's there.
[1:46:02] We don't we sing the song the love of
[1:46:04] God.
[1:46:06] It goes to the lowest hell.
[1:46:08] And the Bible says he's in the thickest
[1:46:10] of darkness.
[1:46:12] That's what the Bible says. So God is
[1:46:14] everywhere.
[1:46:18] He's on earth. He's in heaven. He's
[1:46:21] under the earth.
[1:46:23] He's the um the cover the spirit that
[1:46:27] coverth.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He's everywhere.
[1:46:33] Understand first who God is. If you do
[1:46:36] not understand who God is, therefore you
[1:46:39] cannot understand what you need to be
[1:46:41] redeemed back to.
[1:46:47] you you will not even understand the
[1:46:49] original plan of God for you.
[1:46:53] The original blueprint, the design.
[1:46:57] So the design, the original design of
[1:46:59] God
[1:47:00] was for man to be like him.
[1:47:05] And God was a spirit.
[1:47:09] You see, so man was supposed to be in
[1:47:11] his image.
[1:47:14] So he say let us make money.
[1:47:17] But you see within that God
[1:47:20] there are many attributes
[1:47:25] and that's why he said brother get get
[1:47:28] the right words. Yes. So that's why he
[1:47:30] says let us
[1:47:34] because God is many
[1:47:38] and also God is one. When you say many,
[1:47:42] I don't mean as in persons.
[1:47:45] I mean as the attributes that make him.
[1:47:51] This water is many
[1:47:54] but it is one is many in that it has a
[1:47:58] lot of attributes.
[1:48:00] It has sodium, potassium, calcium,
[1:48:04] magnesium, iron, chloride, sulfate.
[1:48:09] But it is one. But not one like your
[1:48:12] finger.
[1:48:13] You understand? But it is one. And
[1:48:16] that's how God is.
[1:48:19] Amen. And when I say this water, I don't
[1:48:22] mean this bottle.
[1:48:24] I mean the water itself. So God is a
[1:48:27] spirit and he's one but he has a lot of
[1:48:30] attributes and he can be in one
[1:48:34] container
[1:48:36] but also be in many other containers.
[1:48:39] even at the same same time.
[1:48:44] So that's why you know he says let us
[1:48:46] because he's there's a lot of attributes
[1:48:48] within him.
[1:48:51] He wanted to be a father, he wanted to
[1:48:53] be a son, he wanted to be a redeemer, a
[1:48:55] savior, a friend and many many other
[1:48:58] things. All that are the attributes that
[1:49:01] make God.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wanted to create man
[1:49:08] that was in his image,
[1:49:11] a spirit man.
[1:49:14] But that spirit man remember was going
[1:49:17] to be in the image of God.
[1:49:20] So he like God was also going to be one
[1:49:24] man
[1:49:25] but with attributes in him.
[1:49:29] That's why he says male and female
[1:49:33] created he
[1:49:35] He created man in his own image. Male
[1:49:39] and female created he him created he
[1:49:42] them.
[1:49:44] How many did he create?
[1:49:46] One or two one. But within him was more.
[1:49:54] How many?
[1:49:56] So that's how God was. And the man that
[1:49:59] was created also had more attributes.
[1:50:04] the woman was in him.
[1:50:07] That's why when it came to molding a
[1:50:10] woman, when it came to formation in
[1:50:12] Genesis 2,
[1:50:15] you don't find God molding two times.
[1:50:19] Read your Bible very well. He molded
[1:50:22] once and he breathed into him the breath
[1:50:25] of life. And then out of what he had
[1:50:28] molded,
[1:50:31] he took a rib
[1:50:33] and formed a woman. He didn't mold a
[1:50:36] woman separately
[1:50:38] because he didn't create a woman
[1:50:40] separate.
[1:50:42] A woman is a part of a man
[1:50:44] just like the man he created
[1:50:47] in his image,
[1:50:49] a part of God.
[1:50:52] Oh my. Are you beginning to get it?
[1:50:55] Amen. So when you say God,
[1:50:58] you are saying man
[1:51:01] because when you say man, you are saying
[1:51:04] woman because the the moment man was
[1:51:07] created,
[1:51:09] the woman was inside.
[1:51:11] The moment God existed,
[1:51:14] man was inside.
[1:51:17] So what is the true origin of man?
[1:51:20] The true origin of man is the true
[1:51:22] origin of God. Hallelujah.
[1:51:27] Let me say it this way in a lemon
[1:51:29] language. Wherever God came from,
[1:51:33] man came.
[1:51:36] Whenever whenever God existed,
[1:51:40] man existed. I'm talking about the man
[1:51:44] that was in his image.
[1:51:49] This man was not the dust of the ground.
[1:51:53] This man was in a spirit in the image of
[1:51:57] God. He was a spirit man in his
[1:52:01] likeness.
[1:52:03] He had dominion.
[1:52:05] He was created to have dominion.
[1:52:10] This spirit man was created to have
[1:52:13] dominion.
[1:52:15] He will, you know, his will.
[1:52:19] The will of this man
[1:52:21] was perfectly in alignment with God's
[1:52:25] will.
[1:52:30] This is very beautiful stuff that we're
[1:52:32] getting into this tonight. Amen. And and
[1:52:35] you know, you talk about the will of
[1:52:36] God.
[1:52:38] Today, we have to pray and find the will
[1:52:40] of God.
[1:52:42] Adam of Genesis
[1:52:45] was always in the will
[1:52:48] because remember he was in the image of
[1:52:49] God.
[1:52:51] Whatever he saying God said. Whatever
[1:52:54] God said
[1:52:56] because they were one with God
[1:52:59] that oneness which was within their
[1:53:02] essence
[1:53:05] one.
[1:53:10] He was perfect. He was sinless.
[1:53:14] And I want to tell you one more. This
[1:53:16] man of Genesis 1 could not be tempted,
[1:53:22] could not fall.
[1:53:27] Just like God cannot be tempered, cannot
[1:53:31] fall. That's how this man
[1:53:35] perfect. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:53:38] Let me read for you some quotes as we we
[1:53:40] carry on
[1:53:42] in the message demonology physical
[1:53:44] realm.
[1:53:49] Brother Martin, you might want to check
[1:53:50] this. So how that God back in the
[1:53:53] beginning, what he did there,
[1:53:57] how he moved down into the earth and how
[1:54:00] that he made man in his image.
[1:54:04] If you give me your undivided attention,
[1:54:06] we are going to have a very good
[1:54:07] spiritual meal this morning.
[1:54:11] Amen. And how he moved down into the
[1:54:13] earth and how he made man in his image.
[1:54:18] And then God turned around and he was
[1:54:22] made and he was made in the image of a
[1:54:24] man
[1:54:27] to redeem man.
[1:54:30] We shall come back to around the end.
[1:54:33] Now when God made man in his image,
[1:54:37] he was a spirit man.
[1:54:43] Amen. In the message, God is power to
[1:54:45] transform.
[1:54:48] Now we find out that many times it looks
[1:54:52] like the Bible repeating or saying
[1:54:53] something to what it doesn't say.
[1:54:57] For instance, in Genesis 1, we find that
[1:55:00] God created man in his own image.
[1:55:03] in the image of God created he men and
[1:55:06] female created he and then go he goes on
[1:55:10] and many many things happened upon the
[1:55:12] earth
[1:55:14] then we come to find out there was no
[1:55:17] man to till the ground
[1:55:21] then God created a form man out of the
[1:55:25] dust of the ground
[1:55:28] that was a different Man,
[1:55:33] hold your thoughts together now.
[1:55:35] And he breathed the spirit of life into
[1:55:38] him
[1:55:41] and he became a living soul.
[1:55:46] The first man was in the image of God
[1:55:50] which is which is spirit.
[1:55:53] How many are following so far? The first
[1:55:55] man was in the image of God which is
[1:55:57] spirit.
[1:55:59] John 4 says, "God is a spirit that they
[1:56:01] that worship him
[1:56:03] must worship him in spirit and truth."
[1:56:05] But God is a spirit. And the first man
[1:56:08] that he created was spirit man.
[1:56:13] And he was in the image and in the
[1:56:16] likeness
[1:56:18] of God.
[1:56:20] Are you following?
[1:56:22] All right. Now, let us just follow me
[1:56:24] closely as I'm trying to build this for
[1:56:26] you. spiritual signs of the time.
[1:56:32] Brother Bam said something there that I
[1:56:34] want to when God made man in his own
[1:56:38] he was a spirit man and there was no man
[1:56:42] to till the soil
[1:56:45] then he put him in the earth
[1:56:49] rather he put him in five senses.
[1:56:53] Amen. Are you getting it now? We learn
[1:56:56] about five senses in school.
[1:56:58] You know, see, taste, smell, touch,
[1:57:03] hear. These are five senses
[1:57:07] that we are currently in.
[1:57:11] But you see we cannot be able to um you
[1:57:18] know, how can I put it for you to
[1:57:20] understand it very well? The five
[1:57:22] senses,
[1:57:24] we cannot have them if we do not have a
[1:57:28] body,
[1:57:34] a body that can contact
[1:57:37] the earth.
[1:57:40] That's why now it explains why God now
[1:57:43] begins in Genesis 2 to form
[1:57:49] a body.
[1:57:51] [Music]
[1:57:53] You notice that your body
[1:57:57] has all the contents of the soil.
[1:58:03] Whatever the soil is made of,
[1:58:07] your body is made of.
[1:58:10] That's why a true believer does not
[1:58:13] concentrate on this body.
[1:58:17] No matter how beautiful you think your
[1:58:19] body is,
[1:58:21] it is very cheap.
[1:58:26] How much? Does someone know some good
[1:58:28] scientist here?
[1:58:31] A few cents. Yes.
[1:58:34] Huh? 94 cents.
[1:58:47] Your body is not even worth $1.
[1:58:54] And that's true. If we were to take your
[1:58:56] body and burn it
[1:58:59] and we will take it and separate it in
[1:59:02] all these elements
[1:59:06] it can be both
[1:59:09] those elements
[1:59:11] potassium
[1:59:13] what it will be separated zinc
[1:59:17] and the total cost the total price
[1:59:22] is 94 cents
[1:59:27] Think about it. So you don't have to
[1:59:29] spend all your time
[1:59:32] on this body.
[1:59:35] That's why believers don't even waste
[1:59:37] their time with with with makeup.
[1:59:43] We don't have time for that. Our sisters
[1:59:46] don't have time for that
[1:59:49] because they have a revelation.
[1:59:52] They're worth much more than this body.
[1:59:59] They are putting all their time
[2:00:02] in beautifying and making up something
[2:00:06] that is worth much more than the body.
[2:00:12] Hallelujah.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And and the makeup of that is the word.
[2:00:21] Amen. So we see that the body had to be
[2:00:26] uh formed
[2:00:29] so that now man can be able to contact
[2:00:32] the earth where he has been placed.
[2:00:37] And uh you know those senses were given
[2:00:39] to him and these senses help him to
[2:00:42] contact the earth
[2:00:45] so that he can be able to rule over the
[2:00:46] earth so that he can be able to subdue
[2:00:49] the earth have dominion over the earth
[2:00:52] control the other animals. He had to be
[2:00:54] a part of them.
[2:00:56] So then he says now we are looking at
[2:00:59] Genesis 2. He made him an animal
[2:01:04] with the spirit of God in him.
[2:01:09] He made man an animal
[2:01:13] with the spirit of God in him.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Okay, follow me now. We are m
[2:01:21] What does a mamo mean?
[2:01:23] warm blooded animal
[2:01:28] and and and the quote I'm reading here
[2:01:31] was spoken by someone who only finished
[2:01:33] senior P7.
[2:01:36] So he most of these things he was
[2:01:38] inspired
[2:01:40] because he was a prophet. He says we are
[2:01:43] a warm-blooded animal
[2:01:45] which means we are an animal. God came
[2:01:48] down in the form of a man also.
[2:01:52] A man as a man took the form of God.
[2:01:56] Then God took the form of a man
[2:01:59] to redeem back. And we shall come. We
[2:02:01] shall come back to that part of the end.
[2:02:04] Okay. Now, but let us for now focus on
[2:02:06] Genesis uh 1, 2, and 3.
[2:02:10] Look at Genesis 2:7.
[2:02:12] It says, "And the Lord God formed man of
[2:02:15] the dust of the ground.
[2:02:18] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[2:02:20] breath of life,
[2:02:22] and man became a living soul.
[2:02:26] And the Lord God commanded and uh sorry,
[2:02:28] the Lord God planted a garden eastward
[2:02:30] in Eden,
[2:02:34] and there he put the man
[2:02:37] that he had now formed.
[2:02:41] And out of the ground,
[2:02:43] the ground he made to grow many trees.
[2:02:47] And now he came to this man and he told
[2:02:50] him the man he had formed out of the
[2:02:52] glass. He told him now you will eat of
[2:02:57] everything but do not eat of the tree
[2:03:01] of knowledge of good and evil. Do not
[2:03:05] touch, do not eat it rather,
[2:03:08] but others you can eat. So now this man
[2:03:12] of Genesis 2 was placed in this place
[2:03:18] so that he will be subjected to tests.
[2:03:25] So that he will be subjected to tests.
[2:03:28] Tests
[2:03:34] I think that's a different word brother.
[2:03:37] You know he says what he said is free
[2:03:39] will. Yes. He was subjected to free
[2:03:41] will,
[2:03:44] but he was also subjected to tests or
[2:03:46] temptations.
[2:03:52] You know, God is the master architect.
[2:03:57] He's the one who made the blueprint.
[2:04:00] He's the one who made the blueprint
[2:04:03] and he knew how everything would end.
[2:04:08] So there is a reason why he put man he
[2:04:13] removed him from the other place where
[2:04:16] he was and he placed him here in Genesis
[2:04:18] 2
[2:04:22] because he wanted man to be subjected to
[2:04:25] tests.
[2:04:30] Yeah.
[2:04:31] And also because God is a good God.
[2:04:36] He did not want this man to be tempted
[2:04:38] and to be overcome on the basis of what
[2:04:41] God had decided.
[2:04:54] It is what God chose. God is a good God.
[2:04:58] Tell your neighbor, God is a good God.
[2:05:01] Why? He gave this man something.
[2:05:06] He gave him the ability
[2:05:09] that he never gave to animals.
[2:05:12] That ability is called free moral
[2:05:14] agency.
[2:05:15] Agency,
[2:05:18] free will.
[2:05:21] Now, this man of Genesis
[2:05:24] had the ability to decide to do
[2:05:27] something
[2:05:29] or not to do it.
[2:05:31] So this man of Genesis 2 had his own
[2:05:36] will.
[2:05:42] Remember the man of Genesis 1
[2:05:45] did not have his own will.
[2:05:48] Oh yes, he had a will. that this will
[2:05:53] was automatically aligned and
[2:05:55] synchronized with the will of God.
[2:06:02] But the man of Genesis 2,
[2:06:05] his will was independent of God's will.
[2:06:13] So he could decide
[2:06:15] to submit subject to the will of God
[2:06:19] or he could decide to do his own will.
[2:06:25] That's the ability that that man had
[2:06:28] but then God put him under that and he
[2:06:32] said I give you the word now eat
[2:06:34] everything but don't eat this. Now that
[2:06:39] was a test.
[2:06:42] Will you be subject under my will?
[2:06:45] My will is don't eat that tree of
[2:06:50] knowledge.
[2:06:52] But it's up to you. So it's up to you.
[2:06:55] You can do what I want or you can do
[2:06:58] what you want.
[2:07:01] [Applause]
[2:07:02] But man, even if he was in a body of
[2:07:06] flesh
[2:07:08] within him was the life of God.
[2:07:13] And the devil knew that.
[2:07:16] That is why he never came to man.
[2:07:21] He came to a part of a man.
[2:07:25] The woman and when he came to the woman,
[2:07:28] he was very sure this one I can make up
[2:07:31] for.
[2:07:32] This one I can deceive. And if you check
[2:07:35] your Bible, the Bible says it was not
[2:07:39] the man who was deceived.
[2:07:42] 1 Timothy chapter 2, I believe vers 16
[2:07:45] or 17, he says that it was not, it was
[2:07:49] the woman
[2:07:50] who being under transgression,
[2:07:55] you know, she was deceived.
[2:07:57] Oh brother, I wish you had given me the
[2:07:59] the verse quickly.
[2:08:02] Let let us check it out now.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. Listen now. He says,
[2:08:06] "Uh-huh.
[2:08:11] But I suffer not a woman to teach."
[2:08:16] All right. Okay. Verses uh
[2:08:20] Yeah. verses um 14. For Adam was first
[2:08:24] formed and then Eve
[2:08:26] and Adam was not deceived.
[2:08:31] And Adam was what?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Come on church. Come on church. And Adam
[2:08:36] was not.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; So always remember that
[2:08:41] in what I'm trying talking about it has
[2:08:43] a meaning
[2:08:45] a son of God. He that was taken out of
[2:08:49] God
[2:08:51] even if he was in a downgraded version
[2:08:57] he could not be deceived.
[2:09:01] But the devil was so subtle
[2:09:05] that he came in another version
[2:09:09] of Adam and deceived her.
[2:09:13] But the woman being deceived
[2:09:16] was in the transgression.
[2:09:20] Now follow me closely. So why was the
[2:09:23] woman deceived?
[2:09:25] Because the Bible says she was the
[2:09:27] weaker vessel.
[2:09:31] But after she was deceived, oh my, I
[2:09:34] want to go ahead of myself a little bit,
[2:09:35] but after she was deceived,
[2:09:39] she came to Adam
[2:09:42] and Adam said what
[2:09:45] blah blah blah blah blah.
[2:09:48] Adam would have decided that from today
[2:09:53] I am chasing you out of here. I you're
[2:09:55] no longer part of me. You have sinned.
[2:09:58] You have been deceived. Let me tell Papa
[2:10:00] God that you have spilled our our
[2:10:03] lineage.
[2:10:06] But Adam could not do that because Adam
[2:10:09] had a revelation.
[2:10:11] This woman is a part of me.
[2:10:15] She does not have another redeemer.
[2:10:18] I
[2:10:20] son child of God. I am the only of the
[2:10:24] chief.
[2:10:26] If I let her go, no one can help her.
[2:10:31] And so will every man
[2:10:34] have that revelation
[2:10:37] to know you are the savior of the body.
[2:10:43] Every husband knows that.
[2:10:46] Every husband will protect his wife.
[2:10:49] Every husband will fight for him.
[2:10:53] If you you attack a wife, of somebody
[2:10:56] you very well automatically know that
[2:10:59] money is going to bring you hell.
[2:11:03] Even me I'm a good brother
[2:11:06] but you touch my wife you will see.
[2:11:09] That's why in the world there when you
[2:11:12] find husband and wife they slapping each
[2:11:15] other
[2:11:17] and then you come and begin to beat the
[2:11:20] man where he be
[2:11:23] that woman can turn against you
[2:11:26] saying who who told you to come and in
[2:11:28] our things.
[2:11:32] What am I saying? You see the woman is a
[2:11:34] part of a man
[2:11:36] and even now Adam knew I am the only
[2:11:39] hope that she
[2:11:42] Amen. A man must love his wife
[2:11:45] so much that he must be ready to die for
[2:11:48] her.
[2:11:49] Just like Jesus loved his bride so much
[2:11:53] that he was ready and willing
[2:11:56] to die for her so that he can redeem
[2:11:59] her.
[2:12:01] Hallelujah. In the same way, Adam knew I
[2:12:04] am the redeemer of my wife.
[2:12:07] I have to redeem her. And Adam knew, the
[2:12:09] prophet says, Adam knew what he was
[2:12:11] doing.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing when he
[2:12:17] accepted
[2:12:19] to partake of the fruit.
[2:12:22] He knew what he was doing because he
[2:12:24] knew the moment he partakes of the
[2:12:26] future he would have become one with him
[2:12:30] with a woman
[2:12:33] partners in crime.
[2:12:37] So when his redeemer
[2:12:41] when his redeemer comes he will not
[2:12:45] destroy the woman.
[2:12:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; But he will have to destroy Adam.
[2:12:52] But he could not destroy Adam.
[2:12:56] You go and read your Bible. You will
[2:12:59] find that the Bible says when God came
[2:13:02] down, he asked the man, "What have you
[2:13:05] done?" He said, "The woman you gave me."
[2:13:07] And he asked the woman, "Where have you
[2:13:09] gone?" And the woman said, "The
[2:13:11] serpent."
[2:13:13] Now when God began cursing,
[2:13:17] he said, "Cast you be the serpent.
[2:13:20] What you have done from today, you are
[2:13:23] cast above all creatures." This was an
[2:13:27] animal
[2:13:29] with four limbs,
[2:13:33] like you and me. It could talk. Like you
[2:13:37] and me. Can you imagine?
[2:13:40] It was the closest being to a a human
[2:13:42] being.
[2:13:47] It did not have a soul.
[2:13:51] So the devil came into it incarnated it
[2:13:57] and then
[2:13:58] it came and beguiled Eve
[2:14:02] and after Eve was completely defeated
[2:14:06] then she brings the same thing to her
[2:14:09] and he was a partaker of it and when
[2:14:12] this happened God came down and so he
[2:14:15] began by cursing the Sabbath.
[2:14:18] Why? Because he could not he didn't have
[2:14:19] time to worship the Sabbath.
[2:14:22] The serpent was never in his image.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; It was just a creation.
[2:14:29] And then he said, "Cast be you. From
[2:14:32] today you will crawl on your belly. You
[2:14:35] will eat dust.
[2:14:37] So it could no longer have legs.
[2:14:40] No longer eat like us. All the hands
[2:14:42] were deformed and everything." So a
[2:14:44] snake,
[2:14:46] we know where it came from.
[2:14:50] It was not a snake in the in a snake in
[2:14:51] the beginning.
[2:14:56] Some of you didn't know that.
[2:14:58] That is the missing link.
[2:15:02] Come on. That's the missing link. People
[2:15:05] think we came from evolution. No, man
[2:15:10] did not come from evolution. Evolution.
[2:15:13] Man did not come from evolution.
[2:15:16] The reason why they say that because
[2:15:18] according to science they see there is a
[2:15:20] resemblance
[2:15:23] between the mammals animals
[2:15:27] and the man and they feel perhaps
[2:15:31] my man was an animal
[2:15:34] and he was like this he went on changing
[2:15:38] he went until what he is today. But the
[2:15:41] prophet of God, his name is William
[2:15:44] Brham. William.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. When God spoke through
[2:15:49] him, he gave a revelation
[2:15:53] that had made scientists scratch their
[2:15:55] head for centuries.
[2:15:59] He told them, "No, the missing link is
[2:16:02] not that."
[2:16:04] And you know the science has been trying
[2:16:06] to find the missing link.
[2:16:10] What exactly happened?
[2:16:13] I can't understand
[2:16:16] because it is so chained.
[2:16:20] It is not in the original form.
[2:16:25] They've tried to make different animals
[2:16:27] see mingle with the humans
[2:16:31] to see whether a human can.
[2:16:33] It is not possible because God cast it
[2:16:37] beyond repair.
[2:16:41] meaning that it can never again
[2:16:43] mingle with a woman to bring forth a
[2:16:45] child.
[2:16:47] But you see it is a serpent. It's a
[2:16:49] snake. Today it is the missing link. We
[2:16:52] know
[2:16:57] that was the mystery.
[2:17:00] What happened in the beginning?
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Follow me closely. Praise the name of
[2:17:08] the Lord. So God cast this scripture,
[2:17:11] beyond repair, beyond recognition.
[2:17:15] And then he come to the woman. He said,
[2:17:17] "As for you, you will give birth in
[2:17:20] pain.
[2:17:23] And your desire shall be upon your
[2:17:25] husband, the man.
[2:17:28] From that time, women are no longer
[2:17:31] allowed to be teachers of the word."
[2:17:37] If you if you read in 1 Timothy chapter
[2:17:39] 2,
[2:17:41] that is even the reason God gives.
[2:17:45] He says, "Let the women learn in silence
[2:17:47] with all subjection,
[2:17:51] but I suffer not a woman to teach or to
[2:17:53] assert authority over the man,
[2:17:57] but to be in silence." And the reason is
[2:18:00] because Adam was first born, then Eve,
[2:18:04] vers 14. And Adam was not deceived, but
[2:18:07] the woman was being deceived. She was in
[2:18:10] the transgression.
[2:18:12] But not withstanding, she shall be saved
[2:18:18] in childbearing
[2:18:20] if they continue in faith, charity,
[2:18:22] holiness,
[2:18:24] and sobriety. So now even when you go in
[2:18:26] the book of Titus
[2:18:29] where the Bible says women must be
[2:18:31] teachers of good things,
[2:18:36] What kind of teachers are they going to
[2:18:38] be tomorrow?
[2:18:41] The Bible is very clear.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Brother
[2:18:47] Marvin, if you help me, we shall go
[2:18:49] fast. But if you don't,
[2:18:51] we are going to have trouble today.
[2:18:53] Amen. Because it looks like today I'm
[2:18:54] full of scriptures.
[2:18:57] All right. Look at at at this one here.
[2:19:01] All right. What does it say?
[2:19:04] He says that about about Okay. Where
[2:19:06] where is it?
[2:19:10] Is it chapter
[2:19:12] chapter 2
[2:19:14] verse what? We don't have Bible readers
[2:19:17] here.
[2:19:20] Vers 14.
[2:19:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:19:32] Chapter 2 verse.
[2:19:36] Oh yes, God bless you. Listen. The edged
[2:19:39] women likewise
[2:19:42] that they be in behavior becometh as
[2:19:44] becometh holiness,
[2:19:47] not false accusers,
[2:19:49] not given too much wine.
[2:19:55] teachers of good things that they may
[2:19:58] teach the young women to be sober,
[2:20:03] to love their husbands, to love their
[2:20:06] children, to be discreet, church,
[2:20:09] keepers at home, good, obedient to their
[2:20:12] own husbands that the word of God may
[2:20:15] not be blasphemed.
[2:20:17] That is the work of the women who are
[2:20:20] seasoned.
[2:20:23] They teach the younger women how to do
[2:20:27] these things. Amen. When a woman leaves
[2:20:30] that and she comes on the pull pit as an
[2:20:34] apostle
[2:20:36] or as a pastor
[2:20:39] or as a bishop, she has left her place
[2:20:44] because in the book of 1 Timothy chapter
[2:20:47] 3, the Bible talks about the
[2:20:50] requirements of a bishop.
[2:20:53] or a pastor. He says if a man desires
[2:20:56] the office of a bishop,
[2:20:59] he desires a good work. And then he
[2:21:02] begins to talk about it. And then he
[2:21:04] says he must be a man
[2:21:06] who is married with one wife, not a
[2:21:10] woman who is married with one husband.
[2:21:14] So every woman
[2:21:16] who is calling herself a bishop,
[2:21:19] she's out of the will of God. who is
[2:21:21] calling out ourel a pastor is out of the
[2:21:24] will of God. I am so sorry. Here at DVF
[2:21:26] we preach the Bible.
[2:21:31] It doesn't matter how it makes us feel.
[2:21:35] Oh pastor, you are hurting my feelings.
[2:21:37] I am so sorry to hurt your feelings, but
[2:21:40] I'm not so sorry to talk about what the
[2:21:42] Bible say.
[2:21:47] No, I'm trying to build something for
[2:21:49] you. And then when he reached the man he
[2:21:53] could not place any cast
[2:21:59] what did he do? He said cast be the
[2:22:03] ground
[2:22:05] from where you came from.
[2:22:07] He did not cast the man that was in the
[2:22:11] image of God. But he cast the ground.
[2:22:15] That is why until today
[2:22:18] our ground is sick.
[2:22:21] Our ground is sick.
[2:22:24] Where is our ground? Where we came from?
[2:22:29] Right here. The one you saw in the
[2:22:32] mirror before you came.
[2:22:35] The one you washed, the one you perfume,
[2:22:39] the one you put on very good jelly and
[2:22:41] lotion,
[2:22:43] they are cast.
[2:22:47] So every time we walk, we have a cast
[2:22:50] around us.
[2:22:52] This flesh,
[2:22:54] it is cast. That's why no matter how you
[2:22:58] wash,
[2:23:00] it will stink.
[2:23:06] Try it. Go and shower.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Perfume yourself.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Put on a very good lotion
[2:23:16] and then begin doing this. We used to do
[2:23:18] it when we were little babies
[2:23:21] and then
[2:23:26] it's cast
[2:23:28] and the ground you know it will bring
[2:23:32] forth thorns.
[2:23:34] This one begins to bring cancers.
[2:23:38] Where does cancer come from? Where does
[2:23:40] HIV come from? Where does you know all
[2:23:43] these diseases come from? The ground is
[2:23:45] cast. Have no hope in this ground.
[2:23:49] Have no hope in this place.
[2:23:52] That's why let me tell you all your
[2:23:53] substance
[2:23:55] everything that you do serve the Lord
[2:23:58] with it.
[2:24:00] Because this flesh, you will take care
[2:24:03] of it. You will do everything you can.
[2:24:06] It will die.
[2:24:08] The Bible says it came from the ground.
[2:24:10] He will go back to the ground.
[2:24:12] But there is a man who came from God and
[2:24:16] he's going to be redeemed to God
[2:24:21] according to the blue.
[2:24:26] Hallelujah. You see? So now when God
[2:24:29] redeemed when God comes down to redeem
[2:24:32] the man,
[2:24:34] that was his plan. Amen. He allowed him
[2:24:37] to come and visit.
[2:24:39] He allowed him to exercise his free
[2:24:41] will.
[2:24:43] Him as God
[2:24:45] knowing that man
[2:24:47] will make the wrong decision.
[2:24:51] He did not make man to make the wrong
[2:24:52] decision.
[2:24:55] But man in himself
[2:24:59] decided
[2:25:01] using the faculty
[2:25:04] of free moral agency,
[2:25:06] he made a wrong decision. But God before
[2:25:10] the foundation of the world, before he
[2:25:13] created man,
[2:25:15] he knew when I give man the ability to
[2:25:20] make his own choice, he will make a
[2:25:22] wrong choice.
[2:25:24] So that me as God, I can have my other
[2:25:29] attribute
[2:25:31] of redeemer
[2:25:34] so I can come forth
[2:25:36] and I redeemer.
[2:25:40] Hallelujah.
[2:25:42] It was a provided way.
[2:25:45] God knew how everything would end.
[2:25:48] That's why I always say we are
[2:25:51] predestinated.
[2:25:55] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; He knew our end
[2:25:59] to that destination.
[2:26:02] [Music]
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; And then he saved man.
[2:26:07] But when man was redeemed,
[2:26:10] everything he had
[2:26:13] everything he
[2:26:15] and everything he had was redeemed with.
[2:26:21] Hallelujah. Amen. The the the the woman
[2:26:25] was the very first one. She was
[2:26:27] retained.
[2:26:29] Amen. Did you even know that according
[2:26:33] to the Bible,
[2:26:35] a woman wasn't supposed to be married
[2:26:39] if she was not a virgin.
[2:26:46] If they found out they would stone her
[2:26:47] to death
[2:26:50] and you know the the
[2:26:54] but now
[2:26:56] under grace dispensation
[2:26:59] that's no longer the case the Bible says
[2:27:02] all things are
[2:27:05] dead are passed.
[2:27:08] For if any man be in Christ
[2:27:11] he's a new creature. Old things are
[2:27:14] passed away. Old things are new.
[2:27:18] It was only I I have not don't have
[2:27:20] time. It was only the the the the man
[2:27:24] that could enter the Holy of Holies.
[2:27:41] If we follow the Old Testament,
[2:27:44] the women wouldn't get it.
[2:27:47] But when Adam was redeemed, everybody
[2:27:50] was redeemed with that.
[2:27:53] And today, everybody received the Holy
[2:27:56] Ghost. Men and women, children.
[2:28:00] The Bible says there's no more women.
[2:28:01] There is no more men. There is no more
[2:28:03] children. There's no more two.
[2:28:05] We are all free men
[2:28:09] in the spirit.
[2:28:10] for Christ. That's why the Holy Spirit
[2:28:13] will come upon every
[2:28:15] woman, man, and children. They begin
[2:28:18] prophesying. They begin telling dreams
[2:28:20] that you know interpreting tongues.
[2:28:24] Praise the name of the Lord. And the
[2:28:26] ground too was redeemed. Hallelujah.
[2:28:30] Everything.
[2:28:31] Now, let's continue here. This man was
[2:28:35] formed
[2:28:36] from the dust.
[2:28:39] This man was subject
[2:28:42] to test and free will.
[2:28:47] He fell. Everybody say he fell.
[2:28:51] But the plan
[2:28:54] of redemption
[2:28:56] remained intact.
[2:29:01] What was the plan of redemption?
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:05] It was there. It was called the
[2:29:08] blueprint.
[2:29:10] The plan of redemption
[2:29:12] was Genesis chapter one
[2:29:17] man in the image.
[2:29:23] Hebrews chapter 2.
[2:29:26] Then God I just read a quote out of
[2:29:28] that. It says, "Then God made man out of
[2:29:30] the dust of the earth.
[2:29:33] He gave him a hand like a chimpanzeee.
[2:29:36] He gave him a food like a bear.
[2:29:39] He gave him made him on the he made him
[2:29:41] on the image
[2:29:44] the the earthly body in the image of the
[2:29:45] animal life
[2:29:49] and it's made out of the same kind of
[2:29:51] material.
[2:29:53] Your body is made just the same kind of
[2:29:55] material like a horse, dog, anything.
[2:30:01] It's made out of calcium, potassium,
[2:30:03] petroleum, cosmic light. All flesh like
[2:30:06] that is not the same flesh.
[2:30:10] It's different flesh, but it's made out
[2:30:13] of the dust of the earth.
[2:30:16] But the difference between an animal and
[2:30:18] a man
[2:30:20] is God put a soul in a man
[2:30:24] and he didn't put it in the animal
[2:30:26] because the soul that was in the man is
[2:30:28] that theophony
[2:30:32] in the message. Who is this Melisedc?
[2:30:35] You know what the earnest money is?
[2:30:37] Don't you
[2:30:41] know are you you have to you have to
[2:30:44] always pray for preachers
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; because you see you study and you wait
[2:30:48] and on the Lord and you pray and you get
[2:30:50] a lot of things to read and a lot of
[2:30:52] things but you want it to make sense to
[2:30:54] the people.
[2:30:58] So you as you you're hearing just pray
[2:31:00] for me
[2:31:02] and you will walk into the place where I
[2:31:05] am
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; and then you will your your soul will be
[2:31:09] fed.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; So listen an earnest and this if the
[2:31:15] Lord gives us time we shall come to it
[2:31:18] later.
[2:31:20] The earnest.
[2:31:22] So the earnest is a down payment.
[2:31:24] He was wounded for our transgression.
[2:31:27] With his stripes we are healed. Notice
[2:31:29] how wonderful we love him.
[2:31:32] Now this body is subject to the spirit.
[2:31:36] Have not ye entered into the word form
[2:31:40] but we are still in the flesh form but
[2:31:42] subject to the word.
[2:31:48] Death in the flesh will take us there.
[2:31:53] That's the same thing. Think of a little
[2:31:54] baby.
[2:31:56] There's something I'm trying to explain
[2:31:57] to you. You can take a woman, no matter
[2:32:01] how evil she is. When she's pregnant and
[2:32:05] fixing to be mother,
[2:32:07] before that baby is born,
[2:32:11] I don't care how cruel the mother might
[2:32:13] be,
[2:32:14] she will get real kind.
[2:32:18] There is something about her son
[2:32:23] how she talks.
[2:32:26] It seems godly to see a little mother
[2:32:28] fixing to become a mother.
[2:32:34] Is that true?
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Women who are about to give birth are
[2:32:37] always sweet.
[2:32:40] I am asking you mothers, is that true?
[2:32:42] [Music]
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; Well, you may not answer me. I know it
[2:32:50] is true because I am a wife.
[2:32:53] And I've seen whenever she's about to
[2:32:55] give birth,
[2:32:57] she's always very dandy
[2:33:00] and happy.
[2:33:02] Why that little body
[2:33:06] now? It's not alive yet.
[2:33:09] The only thing it is just the flesh and
[2:33:11] muscles.
[2:33:14] That little jumping that's just muscles
[2:33:16] jacking.
[2:33:19] But when it comes forth from the womb,
[2:33:23] God breathes the breath of life in it
[2:33:28] and then he screams out.
[2:33:31] See, as sure as there is a natural body
[2:33:34] being formed.
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:41] There is a natural body being formed
[2:33:47] in the body
[2:33:49] of a woman of a mother. There is also a
[2:33:52] spiritual body
[2:33:55] to receive it as soon as it gets here.
[2:34:00] When I'm now in the same way, when a man
[2:34:03] is born again
[2:34:06] from heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in
[2:34:10] Christ.
[2:34:14] Brothers and sisters,
[2:34:16] I pray that God will impress this on
[2:34:18] your heart.
[2:34:20] I'm showing you how you get back to
[2:34:23] Genesis 1.
[2:34:28] Tell your neighbor, you have to be born
[2:34:29] again.
[2:34:31] [Music]
[2:34:34] And then when this robe of flesh is
[2:34:37] dropped,
[2:34:41] there is a natural body
[2:34:45] theophony.
[2:34:47] A body not made with hand
[2:34:50] neither born of a woman
[2:34:54] that we go to
[2:35:00] when we a man dies
[2:35:03] having been born again.
[2:35:06] Oh, may God help you to bring this
[2:35:07] brother. Amen. When a man is born again
[2:35:11] of the spirit of God and he dies, the
[2:35:15] moment he dies, he drops this body
[2:35:20] and he walks into another body.
[2:35:25] The body he walks into
[2:35:28] is called theophony body.
[2:35:32] It's a body like this one.
[2:35:36] You don't just become a vapor or spirit.
[2:35:41] It's a spiritual body you walk into.
[2:35:46] It's not made with hands.
[2:35:49] It's not Genesis 2.
[2:35:52] It's not a dust of the ground.
[2:35:55] Amen. It's not born out of a woman.
[2:35:59] Then that body returns back
[2:36:04] and picks the glorified body.
[2:36:07] Now some of these things we're going to
[2:36:09] get it slowly. Listen, that's the reason
[2:36:12] Jesus went to hell.
[2:36:14] When he died and preached the souls that
[2:36:16] were in heaven,
[2:36:18] he came back
[2:36:20] with a a theophony.
[2:36:25] Oh, marvelous. Thank God. 2 Corinthians
[2:36:28] 5. If this body be dissolved,
[2:36:31] this tabernacle,
[2:36:33] we have another one. And we, you see, we
[2:36:37] bypass that
[2:36:41] to come straight from God,
[2:36:45] the attribute to be flesh, to be tempted
[2:36:50] and tested by sin
[2:36:53] like Adam did.
[2:36:56] Don't worry, I'll explain it to
[2:37:01] But when testing of his word is over,
[2:37:05] then we are taken up to this body that
[2:37:08] was prepared for us before the
[2:37:10] foundation of the world.
[2:37:14] When the testing is over, when the time
[2:37:17] of temptation is over,
[2:37:19] brother sister, we are going back again
[2:37:25] to the image we lost.
[2:37:30] We are going back again
[2:37:33] to the offic.
[2:37:36] Hallelujah.
[2:37:38] This is not my real body.
[2:37:41] Wait and see me over there.
[2:37:45] This body becomes sick.
[2:37:47] This body is lustful.
[2:37:50] This body is sinful. This body can be
[2:37:53] tempted.
[2:37:54] I tell you what, even when you have the
[2:37:57] Holy Ghost, you will still have
[2:37:59] weaknesses in this body. But brother,
[2:38:01] sister, wait until we cross over.
[2:38:06] Wait until we drop this body.
[2:38:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; When we walk into our body that we will
[2:38:13] see a body, we will be the man of
[2:38:18] Genesis 1.
[2:38:21] We will be the man in the image of God,
[2:38:26] a man that cannot see, a man that cannot
[2:38:29] fall, a man that is perfect.
[2:38:34] Let me build it for you a little more.
[2:38:36] Amen. And then we become the word.
[2:38:40] Here we are formed
[2:38:42] to the word image.
[2:38:45] So right now brother one we are being
[2:38:47] formed.
[2:38:54] Amen. Genesis 1. God speaks the word.
[2:38:59] Let there be man in my image.
[2:39:03] Man was formed. Man was created.
[2:39:07] in the image of God. And then Genesis 2,
[2:39:10] man forms,
[2:39:12] God forms man
[2:39:14] in the dust of the ground. Are you
[2:39:17] hearing me? And man to do what? To be
[2:39:21] tempted. But then brother is saying
[2:39:24] while we are in this body after the
[2:39:26] coming of Jesus,
[2:39:29] in this body we are now again
[2:39:33] [Applause]
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; being formed.
[2:39:38] I am being formed.
[2:39:41] Hallelujah.
[2:39:42] Why do you think I'm sweating?
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; It's not me. Amen. Is God because my
[2:39:49] body listen my body cannot take the
[2:39:53] pressure
[2:39:55] of the spirit. The spirit in me is the
[2:39:58] one forming you,
[2:40:01] speaking through me like a gun will
[2:40:04] shoot a bullet.
[2:40:05] What is happening? You're being formed,
[2:40:09] not the body, but your spiritual body.
[2:40:14] You are being formed in it. As you hear
[2:40:17] the word, you begin to hear
[2:40:21] from your spiritual body.
[2:40:24] You begin to connect
[2:40:27] with your spiritual body.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, deacons, help us. Amen.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; You begin to connect.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Yes.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. That
[2:40:38] young man is connecting.
[2:40:41] Just listen here. Don't be distracted.
[2:40:44] Don't be distracted. When you hear the
[2:40:47] word, your fear body
[2:40:50] is connecting
[2:40:53] [Applause]
[2:40:56] connecting
[2:40:58] connecting. And when it has fully
[2:41:01] connected,
[2:41:03] you will drop this one.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking? You
[2:41:12] will drop this one
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; and you will put on the other one.
[2:41:17] [Applause]
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, listen.
[2:41:22] Amen. You see that little spark of life
[2:41:27] that you had in you from the beginning
[2:41:32] when you started your journey, many of
[2:41:35] you can remember it.
[2:41:37] You know, before we continue, deacons,
[2:41:39] you should always be on a lie.
[2:41:43] Amen. You know, go go when when the word
[2:41:45] is going on, things are happening. All
[2:41:49] right. So, please let us be proactive.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; You know, you don't want someone falling
[2:41:56] down and breaking their their leg or
[2:41:58] something. You can always help them.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; When someone is in the spirit, please
[2:42:02] always help them. Amen. See you you had
[2:42:05] a little spark of life that you had in
[2:42:07] you from the beginning
[2:42:10] when you started your journey. Many of
[2:42:13] you can remember. You joined this church
[2:42:16] and you joined that church. You tried
[2:42:18] this. You tried that but you were not
[2:42:22] satisfied.
[2:42:23] [Applause]
[2:42:25] Are you like me? I was not satisfied.
[2:42:28] But one day when you heard this message,
[2:42:32] you recognized it.
[2:42:36] What was that?
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; You heard from your spirit of
[2:42:46] Praise the Lord. Now, let me try to give
[2:42:48] you a little summary.
[2:42:51] You may be seated if you can. Now,
[2:42:53] listen.
[2:42:54] In Genesis 1,
[2:42:57] here we see spiritual man.
[2:43:01] What do you want to call him? Theophony.
[2:43:05] Spiritual man. He was a spirit man
[2:43:09] created in the image
[2:43:12] of God. The word body.
[2:43:15] The word body.
[2:43:17] Theophony. The word body. And you see
[2:43:20] this body was in the condition
[2:43:23] that it was eternal
[2:43:25] sinless and cannot
[2:43:29] be tempted.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; Cannot
[2:43:36] be tempted.
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:43:41] We are not yet in that body again
[2:43:45] until right now.
[2:43:48] Spiritually some of you already are
[2:43:53] but not fully because this body is
[2:43:54] spirit.
[2:43:58] Okay listen in the message you will see
[2:44:00] Jesus in the beginning God was a spirit
[2:44:04] and all the fountain of goodness
[2:44:07] and mercy and power and all the good the
[2:44:11] good things of life.
[2:44:13] God was the center
[2:44:16] of that fountain.
[2:44:19] And then the locos that went out
[2:44:24] of God in the beginning become what we
[2:44:28] would call a theophony,
[2:44:33] a supernatural body.
[2:44:36] God is just not like the air
[2:44:40] but is in a body.
[2:44:43] Hallelujah.
[2:44:46] A you remember when God when Moses said
[2:44:51] I want to see you God said all right
[2:44:56] he saw a back of
[2:44:59] hey
[2:45:01] you can see a body
[2:45:05] [Applause]
[2:45:07] God was in that body
[2:45:10] it's not a physical body is aopa
[2:45:13] spiritual body When we die, when we are
[2:45:17] changed, we walk into that body.
[2:45:21] It is as real as this is
[2:45:24] and more real because this dice, the
[2:45:26] other one does not die.
[2:45:30] Moses seen him pass
[2:45:33] and he said it looked like a back part
[2:45:34] of a man.
[2:45:37] And then that same Theophony
[2:45:40] was made flesh
[2:45:43] and dwelt among us. Hallelujah.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; He beheld his glory,
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; the only begotten
[2:45:50] of the father,
[2:45:52] Christ.
[2:45:54] Now that's Genesis one.
[2:45:57] That's a spirit man.
[2:46:00] And that's his form
[2:46:02] which he was in. Genesis 2, he was a
[2:46:06] dust man not yet fallen. When God
[2:46:10] breathed into his nostril the breath of
[2:46:12] life, he became a living soul. You see,
[2:46:15] his nature was dusty body
[2:46:19] with the breath of God in him. So he was
[2:46:23] a living soul. So he was innocent.
[2:46:27] He was not fallen. But he was capable of
[2:46:30] choosing.
[2:46:34] of falling or not.
[2:46:37] But you see, why did God bless him
[2:46:41] to be tested in free will?
[2:46:46] So that God can manifest
[2:46:50] more of his attribute
[2:46:53] as a redeemer. Are you following now?
[2:46:56] Now Adam in Genesis 3,
[2:46:59] he was totally fallen dust.
[2:47:05] The net is dust
[2:47:09] now fallen
[2:47:12] completely separated from his theophony
[2:47:20] guilty
[2:47:22] cast
[2:47:25] reproduction by sex
[2:47:30] you know and and and that's how Adam was
[2:47:34] and you know he passed sin and death
[2:47:39] onto all his sin.
[2:47:42] All of us here brothers and sisters, we
[2:47:45] are born that way.
[2:47:49] We are not even born according to the
[2:47:51] man of Genesis
[2:47:53] 2.
[2:47:56] We are born according to the man of
[2:47:58] Genesis 3.
[2:48:02] I hear people say on weddings
[2:48:05] in the image of God.
[2:48:10] Who are you in the image of God? You
[2:48:12] know what you're talking about.
[2:48:14] You're talking about Genesis 1.
[2:48:22] None of them is
[2:48:26] image of God. You know what you're
[2:48:28] talking about.
[2:48:30] But many believers
[2:48:33] have have arrived in Genesis.
[2:48:35] Hallelujah.
[2:48:39] Amen.
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; That is not our end.
[2:48:44] Genesis 2 helps us to hear from our
[2:48:47] fearful.
[2:48:52] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:48:55] whereby
[2:48:56] we are we have we have heard from
[2:49:01] and we have power
[2:49:04] to make a choice because remember we are
[2:49:08] still in the dust body
[2:49:12] the dust body
[2:49:14] can fall
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; and can refuse to
[2:49:25] As long as
[2:49:28] that of life,
[2:49:32] as long as that Holy Ghost is there,
[2:49:36] as long as that the Holy Ghost is there,
[2:49:39] it's a part of your fearfulness.
[2:49:44] Now, when you hear the word, you receive
[2:49:48] the word, you receive the Holy Ghost.
[2:49:51] What happens to you? You are still a
[2:49:54] dust man.
[2:49:57] Not in the image of God.
[2:50:00] As far as your body is concerned,
[2:50:04] but spiritually,
[2:50:08] you are in the image of God. Hallelujah.
[2:50:16] A man with the Holy Ghost,
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; a man dust body
[2:50:22] can still do wrong things
[2:50:25] if he decides to.
[2:50:30] But a man with the Holy Ghost
[2:50:34] cannot sin,
[2:50:37] do any wrong things according to his
[2:50:39] decisions.
[2:50:42] You are like Adam
[2:50:44] when his wife came. He would have said
[2:50:47] no or yes. But he said yes and he fell.
[2:50:53] But he knew he had a redeemer.
[2:50:56] But Jesus died once he will not do
[2:50:59] twice. That's what the Bible says. After
[2:51:01] we have come to Jesus Christ, after we
[2:51:04] have seen the light, after we have
[2:51:07] tested of the gift of
[2:51:10] the Holy Spirit, if we go back again,
[2:51:15] there is no more sacrifice.
[2:51:19] Hallelujah.
[2:51:20] When a man receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:51:23] let me tell you, brother, you have a
[2:51:26] power within you
[2:51:28] to bring this flesh
[2:51:31] and subjection
[2:51:34] to begin to control
[2:51:37] your seeing,
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; you are hearing, you are touching, you
[2:51:42] are touching.
[2:51:44] You have the power
[2:51:47] within you. Hallelujah. But this is not
[2:51:50] the end.
[2:51:53] This is the earnest.
[2:51:56] The the Bible says the Holy Spirit is
[2:52:00] the earnest is a down payment.
[2:52:05] There's more coming.
[2:52:07] Genesis 2 is the earnest.
[2:52:11] Genesis one is on the way.
[2:52:14] What is Genesis 1? We must be fully back
[2:52:19] again our theophony body.
[2:52:26] Hallelujah.
[2:52:28] [Applause]
[2:52:30] I tell you friends,
[2:52:32] this is true. Follow me closely now.
[2:52:36] Praise the name of the Lord. Are you
[2:52:38] enjoying the word? Says
[2:52:42] Adam forfeeded everything
[2:52:45] in the bridge. Brother Bham says
[2:52:49] he forfeited the book of redemption.
[2:52:52] And where is the book now? It is back to
[2:52:55] its original owner
[2:52:57] because it has been forfeed by a son,
[2:53:00] the first son in a human race.
[2:53:05] And when he fades
[2:53:08] to listen to Satan, he gives it up. What
[2:53:12] did he do? He accepted Satan's wisdom
[2:53:16] instead of God's word.
[2:53:19] Now, couldn't we stop here a while?
[2:53:23] Sons of God will take a seminary
[2:53:26] seminar's idea about it
[2:53:31] instead of the word of God.
[2:53:33] Same thing indeed. He fulfaded his
[2:53:37] right.
[2:53:40] You don't say, "Oh, I need to go and be
[2:53:41] taught theology."
[2:53:43] That's not the way to know God. The way
[2:53:46] to know God, read the word.
[2:53:49] listen to the word and pray.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God wants to fill you with the
[2:53:56] Holy Ghost.
[2:53:57] And when it did, it went right straight
[2:54:01] back.
[2:54:05] When Adam did
[2:54:08] the book returned,
[2:54:11] the original owner who gave it out,
[2:54:14] can you see where those ages has been
[2:54:18] went? right back again to the original
[2:54:19] holder.
[2:54:22] Now, what is redemption?
[2:54:25] Redemption is not just patching up
[2:54:30] of the fallen dust man.
[2:54:37] You understand?
[2:54:38] Many times when we we we think of
[2:54:40] redemption, we think of going back to
[2:54:43] Genesis 2.
[2:54:48] And we think we're going to remain
[2:54:49] dusty.
[2:54:52] Pashed up.
[2:54:55] Redemption means
[2:54:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; God restores
[2:55:02] back
[2:55:04] to his original salt.
[2:55:10] the blueprint man
[2:55:15] of Genesis 1,
[2:55:18] his image, his likeness,
[2:55:21] his true attribute.
[2:55:25] That's redemption
[2:55:31] to with the change of our bodies.
[2:55:35] This is why Paul said in Colossians
[2:55:37] 3:10,
[2:55:39] "And put on the new man,
[2:55:43] the new man which is renewed
[2:55:48] in knowledge
[2:55:50] after the image
[2:55:53] of him that created him."
[2:55:57] Hallelujah.
[2:56:00] Amen.
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; That's redemption.
[2:56:03] putting on a new man
[2:56:06] after the knowledge
[2:56:09] after the image
[2:56:11] of him that created him.
[2:56:14] The book of redemption
[2:56:17] is an abstract title deed.
[2:56:23] If you have ever seen a title deed, it
[2:56:26] shows the owners.
[2:56:28] An abstract title did
[2:56:31] an abstract is different from what did
[2:56:36] an abstract title did is always searched
[2:56:39] way back again to the beginning.
[2:56:45] So all right waiting what is it doing?
[2:56:48] The book is in the hand. I'm now quoting
[2:56:51] from the bridge. The hands of God
[2:56:54] waiting for redemption claims.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Marvin, while you are seated
[2:57:03] there, get in the spirit. Preach with
[2:57:06] me. Amen. By now, I should have had
[2:57:09] Revelation 5.
[2:57:12] You see here is the one that is sitting
[2:57:14] on the throne
[2:57:17] and in his hand was a book
[2:57:20] on his hand was a book
[2:57:24] sealed
[2:57:26] with seven seals and there was no one
[2:57:30] whether to take the book of
[2:57:33] so what is he doing on the throne he's
[2:57:37] waiting listen church he's waiting for
[2:57:40] redemption ion claims.
[2:57:46] He's waiting for somebody to claim the
[2:57:48] book.
[2:57:53] Someone who has the ability
[2:57:56] to bring forth redemption.
[2:58:01] Someone who can pay the price of
[2:58:02] redemption.
[2:58:05] See, he was waiting for him. So, he made
[2:58:08] a way of redemption.
[2:58:11] He made a way back
[2:58:13] and somebody sorry someday the redeemer
[2:58:16] is to take it back.
[2:58:22] You see where we are getting to now? We
[2:58:24] will watch this fellow sitting upon the
[2:58:26] throne.
[2:58:29] All right. Waiting for redemption claim.
[2:58:34] What? Listen church. Now just just
[2:58:35] listen. What is this book of redemption?
[2:58:39] This title deed abstract title did you
[2:58:42] say abstract?
[2:58:45] What does abstract mean? Means it is
[2:58:48] searched all the way back to the
[2:58:50] beginning
[2:58:54] like that little drop of ink this
[2:58:56] morning.
[2:58:59] When it struck that bleach,
[2:59:02] it went all the way back.
[2:59:07] And when sin has been confessed
[2:59:12] and fallen into the blood of Jesus
[2:59:14] Christ, it gives an abstract
[2:59:19] right straight back to the creator
[2:59:21] again.
[2:59:24] How many of you know bleach?
[2:59:29] Oh, how is it called?
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; You call it jig.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; When you take ink
[2:59:37] and you put bleach.
[2:59:49] When you take ink
[2:59:51] and you power it in jig in bleach,
[2:59:56] would you see that ink?
[3:00:00] It disappears.
[3:00:04] where to where
[3:00:07] it has gone back again
[3:00:12] before it was formed
[3:00:14] until it completely disappeared.
[3:00:17] Are you following? And he says when a
[3:00:19] sin has been confessed,
[3:00:22] it is fallen into the blood of Jesus
[3:00:25] and that gives an abstract. It is it is
[3:00:27] go gone back again to this creator
[3:00:29] again.
[3:00:33] Sin is not remembered anymore.
[3:00:37] The moment it falls in the blood.
[3:00:40] That's why in the beginning we sang the
[3:00:42] blood.
[3:00:44] The bleach
[3:00:47] is the blood.
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; You become a son of God.
[3:00:56] An abstract title deed is held in the
[3:00:59] hands of the almighty. His
[3:01:03] redemption means all legal possession
[3:01:10] to to all that was lost by Adam and Eve.
[3:01:16] What ought that to do to a born again
[3:01:18] Christian?
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:22] Everything
[3:01:24] lost.
[3:01:29] You would have regained them back again.
[3:01:31] It is redemption.
[3:01:34] What were they in the beginning? They
[3:01:37] were in Genesis one in the image of God,
[3:01:42] but they lost it. They lost it because
[3:01:45] of the decision of Adam.
[3:01:47] The recklessness they had
[3:01:50] is lost. But oh Jesus when he came,
[3:01:55] he came with what we call the bleach.
[3:02:00] He was he was a redeemer.
[3:02:04] He could come and bring back everything
[3:02:09] that Adam lost.
[3:02:13] If I were you,
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; I would start to order
[3:02:19] give me what belongs to me
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; because you understand
[3:02:23] Satan has no
[3:02:27] you are redeemed.
[3:02:29] You are redeemed back again to the
[3:02:32] image. You may not be physically
[3:02:36] but spiritually you are
[3:02:38] seated in heavenly places
[3:02:41] with the Christ Jesus. This is the
[3:02:43] mystery that has now been unveiled.
[3:02:47] What is the mystery? Christ in you the
[3:02:51] hope of glory. You can now have the
[3:02:54] power
[3:02:56] to claim
[3:02:58] everything
[3:02:59] that the devil stole from you.
[3:03:02] Hallelujah.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; You claim your joy.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; You claim your innocence.
[3:03:08] [Applause]
[3:03:09] You claim your marriage.
[3:03:11] &gt;&gt; You claim your righteousness. You claim
[3:03:14] your power. You claim your victory. You
[3:03:17] claim your house. You claim everything.
[3:03:20] Whatever the devil stole from you as a
[3:03:24] believer, even before you get to Genesis
[3:03:27] 1,
[3:03:29] you have the authority
[3:03:31] to begin claiming
[3:03:34] one by one.
[3:03:38] [Applause]
[3:03:39] And after that, you tell Satan, "This is
[3:03:43] just the beginning."
[3:03:47] [Applause]
[3:03:48] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; This is just the beginning.
[3:03:52] Soon and very soon, you know what? I
[3:03:56] don't want to sing. Soon and very soon,
[3:03:58] we're going to see the king. I want to
[3:04:00] sing soon and very soon. Soon and very
[3:04:03] soon, we are going to go back again to
[3:04:07] our real body.
[3:04:14] Hallelujah.
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:18] Okay, just give me a few minutes.
[3:04:22] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:04:26] On Tuesday, I'm going to Ethiopia.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; And so I'm not preaching on on on on
[3:04:30] Wednesday.
[3:04:32] So give me 20 more minutes, guys.
[3:04:34] Amen. Hallelujah. Can I finish this?
[3:04:39] Amen. Adam could not meet the
[3:04:41] requirements
[3:04:43] of redemption after he found he lost it.
[3:04:48] He had sinned and he had separated
[3:04:51] himself from God was on this side of the
[3:04:55] chasm.
[3:04:57] So he could not redeem it. He just could
[3:05:00] not. He needed the redemption himself.
[3:05:03] He could not
[3:05:05] even you like Adam could not. But the
[3:05:09] law required
[3:05:11] kings man redeemer.
[3:05:14] The law of God required a kinsman
[3:05:16] redeemer.
[3:05:18] And and the prophet says you need to
[3:05:19] mark that down.
[3:05:21] Kings man redeemer.
[3:05:24] Everybody say kings man redeemer.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; Not a stranger,
[3:05:36] not a friend,
[3:05:39] a brother.
[3:05:44] And the devil was jumping and dancing.
[3:05:47] They don't have anyone. Adam was the
[3:05:50] only one.
[3:05:52] Adam was the only one. No one can
[3:05:54] redeem. Adam was the only one. No one
[3:05:58] can redeem. He has no kinsman. According
[3:06:01] to the law of God, he has to have a
[3:06:03] kinsman. But Adam was the only one. But
[3:06:07] someone wants to tell the devil
[3:06:10] there is just about to be a brother
[3:06:15] Adam is just about
[3:06:17] &gt;&gt; to have a brother
[3:06:19] not just a brother.
[3:06:24] Satan was confused.
[3:06:27] There is no brother after Adam. All who
[3:06:30] are born after him are sinners. Before
[3:06:34] him they are no brothers.
[3:06:37] Satan did not understand that Adam came
[3:06:42] from Genesis 1.
[3:06:44] Before
[3:06:46] [Music]
[3:06:48] he came to Genesis 2,
[3:06:54] did Adam have a brother in Genesis 1?
[3:07:00] I ask again,
[3:07:02] did Adam have a brother in Genesis 1?
[3:07:05] Adam
[3:07:07] [Laughter]
[3:07:10] in our image.
[3:07:14] Hallelujah.
[3:07:15] [Applause]
[3:07:20] So there was already a brother.
[3:07:23] Hallelujah. You and Jesus, me and Jesus,
[3:07:29] we are both in there.
[3:07:32] Hallelujah. We are both in there.
[3:07:34] Satan did not know. We were both in
[3:07:38] there.
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; We had a brother before we were born.
[3:07:43] Hallelujah.
[3:07:47] Hallelujah. We had a brother.
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; Satan did not know
[3:07:53] &gt;&gt; and even today he doesn't know. But I
[3:07:57] say we have a brother.
[3:08:02] Hallelujah.
[3:08:04] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; If you have a doubt,
[3:08:07] listen to first Corinthians
[3:08:10] chapter 15 vers 45. This one will shake
[3:08:14] you up.
[3:08:15] And so it is written, "The first man
[3:08:22] was made a living soul."
[3:08:26] Yes, sir.
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; Is that a man?
[3:08:29] &gt;&gt; Is that a man?
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; Is that a man?
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3:08:33] The last Adam.
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; Wait, please. I'm confused.
[3:08:43] Pause everything.
[3:08:45] Let me understand the Bible.
[3:08:48] You mean there were two Adams created?
[3:08:55] &gt;&gt; I didn't know.
[3:08:57] The first Adam
[3:08:59] was made a living soul.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; But the last Adam,
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; which means this second Adam
[3:09:09] came after the last Adam.
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it, brother?
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; Listen. This last Adam was made
[3:09:27] a quickening.
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; The first one was a a living soul.
[3:09:42] But the second Adam
[3:09:44] was not just a soul
[3:09:48] was a spirit.
[3:09:53] What were you in the beginning?
[3:09:56] You were a spirit.
[3:10:00] Hallelujah. A spirit man.
[3:10:03] Let us create man in our image. Oh, God
[3:10:08] created man in his own image.
[3:10:13] Who was God? A spirit. So, who is the
[3:10:17] second Adam? A spirit, not just a
[3:10:21] spirit.
[3:10:23] A spirit
[3:10:25] that quickens.
[3:10:28] [Applause]
[3:10:30] Hallelujah.
[3:10:32] Listen.
[3:10:34] When in when when Adam became a living
[3:10:36] soul,
[3:10:38] it was after
[3:10:42] it was after the quickening spirit
[3:10:46] had been put in him
[3:10:48] by God that quickenth.
[3:10:56] Now I'm confused.
[3:10:58] is the second Adam, my brother
[3:11:02] or the very God that made me come into
[3:11:09] the voice over because I'm confused.
[3:11:12] I need to understand this is the second
[3:11:15] Adam.
[3:11:16] The God that created the first Adam
[3:11:20] or just a brother.
[3:11:22] He was both.
[3:11:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:11:30] How b that that was not first which is
[3:11:33] spiritual but that which is natural
[3:11:38] and afterward that was spiritual.
[3:11:41] The first man is of the earth.
[3:11:46] The second man
[3:11:49] the second man.
[3:11:51] The second man
[3:11:53] is the Lord from heaven.
[3:11:59] [Applause]
[3:12:01] Hallelujah.
[3:12:02] &gt;&gt; The second what
[3:12:06] does does language have meaning anymore?
[3:12:09] The second what
[3:12:12] man.
[3:12:17] Who is God?
[3:12:19] God is a
[3:12:23] second man. The second man was our
[3:12:25] quickening.
[3:12:29] The second what
[3:12:31] man. Please say it so you can get it.
[3:12:35] &gt;&gt; The second what
[3:12:38] was a
[3:12:40] quickening spirit
[3:12:43] who was the Lord
[3:12:47] from heaven.
[3:12:49] [Applause]
[3:12:51] In simple terms, the Lord from heaven,
[3:12:55] the quickening spirit
[3:12:58] became a man.
[3:13:00] Hallelujah.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[3:13:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, give me that verse.
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; John one.
[3:13:12] In the beginning was the word and the
[3:13:15] word was
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; with God.
[3:13:19] And the word was
[3:13:24] the same was
[3:13:26] in the beginning.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; Give me the next verse quickly. Quickly.
[3:13:37] Go. Go behind. Go behind. Go behind,
[3:13:39] brother. Go behind. Verse three. Listen.
[3:13:40] Read with me. All things
[3:13:44] wait. Read again.
[3:13:47] All feelings.
[3:13:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Go behind. Go behind.
[3:13:55] Oh, go back again.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the
[3:14:02] And the word was
[3:14:05] And the word was
[3:14:08] okay. Don't worry. You'll get it. Vers
[3:14:11] two. The same who
[3:14:14] who the word who was in the beginning
[3:14:18] with
[3:14:21] God. Okay. Verse three.
[3:14:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. All things
[3:14:28] all
[3:14:31] read with me were made by him.
[3:14:37] &gt;&gt; Who?
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; God. who is
[3:14:41] &gt;&gt; the
[3:14:44] And without him,
[3:14:46] &gt;&gt; without him
[3:14:48] was not anything made that was.
[3:14:56] Amen. Whether there be thrones, whe
[3:14:59] there be kings, whether it be heaven,
[3:15:01] whether it be earth, whether it be hell,
[3:15:04] whatever was made, there was nothing
[3:15:07] made that was made.
[3:15:11] without the world
[3:15:13] making it.
[3:15:18] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Give me verses 14.
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; And the word was
[3:15:26] made.
[3:15:32] And the word was
[3:15:35] flesh.
[3:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to think.
[3:15:42] &gt;&gt; And the word was
[3:15:44] made flesh.
[3:15:47] Who was made flesh?
[3:15:54] Who is the word?
[3:15:56] God.
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. Can you now read it again?
[3:16:00] And God
[3:16:03] was made.
[3:16:06] [Music]
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; Satan must be confused.
[3:16:14] [Laughter]
[3:16:17] Hallelujah.
[3:16:18] &gt;&gt; I feel like shouting.
[3:16:21] God was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[3:16:28] Hallelujah. And we beheld his glory,
[3:16:33] the glory
[3:16:35] of the only begotten of the father,
[3:16:40] &gt;&gt; full of grace and truth.
[3:16:43] [Music]
[3:16:45] [Applause]
[3:16:47] So the word was begotten
[3:16:53] &gt;&gt; by the father.
[3:16:57] Amen. So what does it mean? It means
[3:17:00] Jesus is called the second Adam
[3:17:05] because he was begotten.
[3:17:09] &gt;&gt; Just like Adam in the beginning was
[3:17:10] begotten.
[3:17:14] So that's why he's our brother.
[3:17:18] That's why there is nothing like eternal
[3:17:20] son.
[3:17:23] God the father,
[3:17:25] God the son. rubbish.
[3:17:28] Check your Bible. Those words are not
[3:17:30] there.
[3:17:32] There is nothing like God the Son.
[3:17:35] He's only the son
[3:17:37] who is a manifestation of the father
[3:17:41] and he had a beginning
[3:17:44] of his office and the end.
[3:17:50] Sons begin and end.
[3:17:55] But God has no beginning.
[3:17:59] You are about to see something here.
[3:18:01] This God put on flesh
[3:18:05] and he called it the son.
[3:18:09] But actually
[3:18:13] it is actually
[3:18:17] words like a meaning.
[3:18:22] It is God himself
[3:18:25] [Applause]
[3:18:30] coming
[3:18:32] &gt;&gt; into the flesh.
[3:18:33] [Music]
[3:18:36] They call him the son,
[3:18:39] son of Mary. He's more than son of Mary.
[3:18:43] He's God himself
[3:18:46] tabernacle
[3:18:48] in man.
[3:18:50] Philippians chapter 2.
[3:18:54] Let this mind be
[3:18:59] brother quickly. Let this mind be
[3:19:05] as it was in Christ Jesus.
[3:19:11] Who? Who? Jesus. Yes.
[3:19:14] &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God.
[3:19:22] &gt;&gt; Thought it not rob to be equal with God.
[3:19:30] &gt;&gt; Exactly. You said it right.
[3:19:32] &gt;&gt; Wait, church. I'm coming to the climax
[3:19:34] very soon.
[3:19:36] He was in the form of God,
[3:19:39] but he never made himself even equal
[3:19:42] with God.
[3:19:44] Give me the next verse.
[3:19:47] But made himself
[3:19:51] of no reputation.
[3:19:59] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Check your Bible
[3:20:02] quickly.
[3:20:04] John 1:14 said what?
[3:20:09] Please church tell me
[3:20:13] the word was brother we are still here
[3:20:15] don't go away don't go away don't go
[3:20:16] away the word was
[3:20:21] who made it
[3:20:26] but made himself
[3:20:29] hallelujah
[3:20:32] of no reputation
[3:20:38] he was god
[3:20:40] He made himself
[3:20:42] of no reputation,
[3:20:45] and he took upon him
[3:20:49] the form
[3:20:51] of a servant,
[3:20:53] and was made
[3:20:56] in the likeness
[3:20:59] of men,
[3:21:02] being found in a fashion as a man. Come
[3:21:04] on. Come on. Continue. Continue,
[3:21:05] brother. Hallelujah. Vers 8. where I
[3:21:09] forgot no no and being found in a
[3:21:11] fashion as a man,
[3:21:15] he humbled himself
[3:21:17] in and became
[3:21:20] obedient unto death
[3:21:23] even the death of the cross.
[3:21:26] So who was it? It was God who made
[3:21:30] himself of no reputation
[3:21:33] and he came and he died. What was he
[3:21:36] doing? She was proving a point. She was
[3:21:40] proving a point that I am here to redeem
[3:21:44] everything that was a part of me in the
[3:21:47] beginning.
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man was in my image, I must
[3:21:53] redeem him. Whatever it takes, I am
[3:21:57] going to do it. If it takes me to become
[3:21:59] a man, I am going to become a man. If it
[3:22:02] takes me to lose my reputation, I will
[3:22:04] do it. I must come down.
[3:22:07] I cannot leave part of me to be
[3:22:11] destroyed.
[3:22:16] That's why Adam did what he did
[3:22:19] because he knew the blueprint.
[3:22:23] He knew the blueprint.
[3:22:27] Everything must go according to plan.
[3:22:31] Brother, do you have that little picture
[3:22:34] which I sent on the media team group?
[3:22:37] You did not get it. Oh, praise the name
[3:22:39] of the Lord. Try to get it if you can.
[3:22:42] See, I wanted to show you a little
[3:22:45] image so you can understand.
[3:22:48] Genesis 1, the blueprint man
[3:22:54] in the image and likeness
[3:23:00] of God. Don't you worry about brother M.
[3:23:03] I never told him. He's just there. If he
[3:23:04] gets it, he gets it. If he doesn't get
[3:23:06] it, no problem. Let's just continue here
[3:23:09] cuz I want to reach the climax and
[3:23:10] finish. So man Genesis one
[3:23:15] blueprint man
[3:23:17] was in the image and likeness of God
[3:23:19] Genesis 2 he was a vessel man
[3:23:23] formed from dust
[3:23:25] living so
[3:23:28] then we see the fall coming
[3:23:31] man losing dominion
[3:23:33] Genesis 3 then we see Revelation 5
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; you see how it jumps from beginning to
[3:23:44] redemption
[3:23:46] through Christ.
[3:23:48] Quickening spirit,
[3:23:50] restoration
[3:23:53] to the blueprint
[3:23:56] back again to the Genesis one.
[3:24:00] He was the quickening spirit,
[3:24:04] the creator himself coming down
[3:24:08] to redeem his blueprint.
[3:24:12] and he said, "Oh, the father has given
[3:24:14] me." Hallelujah.
[3:24:18] He knew them.
[3:24:20] No man can cast them from my hand.
[3:24:24] Amen. I will raise him up at the last
[3:24:26] day.
[3:24:28] But as many as have received him, to
[3:24:31] them gave him power to become the sons
[3:24:33] of God. That is true spiritual adoption.
[3:24:38] given unto them
[3:24:40] that believe on his name,
[3:24:43] which were born,
[3:24:46] which were born not of blood,
[3:24:50] nor of the will of the flesh,
[3:24:53] nor of the will of man,
[3:24:57] but the will of God.
[3:25:00] Now let me stand here and reaffirm.
[3:25:07] I have received him
[3:25:10] and therefore I'm a son of God.
[3:25:13] I have believed on his name. I am not
[3:25:16] born of blood. I am not born of flesh. I
[3:25:20] am not born of the will of man. I am
[3:25:22] born of the will of God.
[3:25:26] according as he has chosen
[3:25:28] me in him before the foundation of the
[3:25:32] world that I should be holy.
[3:25:35] You see now holiness. Genesis 1
[3:25:42] that I should be holy and without blazer
[3:25:45] before him in love
[3:25:48] having predestinated me
[3:25:51] and to adoption
[3:25:53] of children of a child by Jesus Christ
[3:25:58] to himself.
[3:26:01] Now listen to this part my brother.
[3:26:03] according
[3:26:05] to the good pleasure
[3:26:09] of his
[3:26:11] his
[3:26:13] will.
[3:26:15] Whether you want or not. Hallelujah.
[3:26:19] Whether the devil want
[3:26:25] to go,
[3:26:29] it is not your will. It is not my will.
[3:26:34] He said, "All of mine,
[3:26:36] all of them will get lost. They're in my
[3:26:39] hands." Hallelujah.
[3:26:41] &gt;&gt; According to the pleasure of my will,
[3:26:48] who loved you to get saved
[3:26:51] all your
[3:26:57] way. Hallelujah.
[3:27:01] He loved it.
[3:27:03] For you're his brother.
[3:27:04] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[3:27:07] He must restore and bring you back.
[3:27:11] Hallelujah. The bride
[3:27:14] has an eternal part in him.
[3:27:18] I was remaining with one quote, but I'm
[3:27:20] not going to read it.
[3:27:22] But let me just say this. Amen. The
[3:27:25] blood of Jesus that has been redeemed
[3:27:28] back to the blueprint has an eternal
[3:27:32] path
[3:27:34] that cannot be destroyed.
[3:27:40] When we preach the word and we hear the
[3:27:43] word and we receive the word, we hear
[3:27:46] from our the
[3:27:50] [Applause]
[3:27:53] body
[3:27:55] Let me read the scripture as we finish.
[3:27:58] There is a body that we are waiting to
[3:28:00] enter in. There is another body.
[3:28:04] Hallelujah. 1 second Corinthians 5.
[3:28:08] For we know rather quickly. For we know
[3:28:12] that if our earthly house
[3:28:17] of this tur
[3:28:21] dissolved,
[3:28:23] &gt;&gt; we have a building of God.
[3:28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a building of God.
[3:28:31] We have a building of God.
[3:28:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Even if your father
[3:28:36] has no house,
[3:28:41] help me to finish this. Even if your
[3:28:43] father has no house,
[3:28:45] even if your home have never owned a
[3:28:47] house,
[3:28:48] let me tell you, there is a building of
[3:28:50] God.
[3:28:52] Jesus said, "I go to prepare a house.
[3:28:57] There is a mansion. There's a building.
[3:29:01] Every one of you has
[3:29:03] [Applause]
[3:29:06] in my father's house.
[3:29:09] How many mansion
[3:29:11] I go to prepare a place for you.
[3:29:14] What is that place? What is that
[3:29:17] building?
[3:29:18] &gt;&gt; What is that house?
[3:29:20] &gt;&gt; That is your spiritual body.
[3:29:26] Jesus,
[3:29:26] &gt;&gt; yes.
[3:29:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not a living soul because he
[3:29:32] was a spirit that gives life.
[3:29:35] There's a part which I didn't go to. Let
[3:29:36] me try to summarize everything right
[3:29:37] now. Jesus who has a spirit which gives
[3:29:40] life that Jesus never bypass his
[3:29:44] spiritual body.
[3:29:47] He was born as the word.
[3:29:50] Amen. He came first
[3:29:55] then flesh
[3:29:57] then back again. Now listen listen I'm
[3:30:01] trying to close so help me close now.
[3:30:05] Jesus when he came in this tent,
[3:30:10] &gt;&gt; the only reason Oh, thank you Jesus. The
[3:30:13] only reason why he was not defeated
[3:30:18] is because
[3:30:20] he never he never bypasses theophony
[3:30:29] because everyone in the flesh
[3:30:35] must be tempted
[3:30:37] and defeated.
[3:30:41] Jesus only was the one who came in the
[3:30:45] flesh and was tempted. All right,
[3:30:49] Adam of Genesis 2.
[3:30:52] But he, Jesus, the second Adam was not
[3:30:56] defeated.
[3:31:00] &gt;&gt; Why? because he was the Lord from
[3:31:02] heaven.
[3:31:05] Because he was the quickening spirit.
[3:31:09] And when we say we are going to be
[3:31:13] redeemed,
[3:31:16] it's not just to Genesis 2
[3:31:19] because Genesis 2 still you can still
[3:31:20] fall.
[3:31:23] You have your own will.
[3:31:28] Amen. Yeah,
[3:31:29] &gt;&gt; but we are being taken all the way back
[3:31:33] &gt;&gt; to a place
[3:31:35] where
[3:31:37] you will not have a a a a will that is
[3:31:41] different from the father
[3:31:49] today as a believer when you receive the
[3:31:52] word and believe the word and receive
[3:31:55] the Holy Ghost even when you are in this
[3:31:58] flesh.
[3:31:59] You become Genesis 2 man.
[3:32:02] But even then you will fight. You will
[3:32:06] fight. But each time you are saying let
[3:32:10] your will be done. Let your will be
[3:32:13] done. Meaning you have a will.
[3:32:17] You have a will but the will of the
[3:32:20] father is in you. So you are fighting.
[3:32:24] You are fighting. You're trying to do
[3:32:26] good. Evil is around you because of the
[3:32:29] flesh, because of your will. Your
[3:32:32] greatest enemy is the flesh.
[3:32:35] But brother, sister, we must fight. We
[3:32:39] must fight because the Holy Ghost which
[3:32:43] has been given to us is the earnest.
[3:32:48] And you cannot overcome
[3:32:50] if you don't have the Holy Spirit.
[3:32:55] You must be baptized
[3:32:58] with the Holy Spirit. It is the power to
[3:33:01] help you fight.
[3:33:04] Without the Holy Ghost, every little bit
[3:33:07] temptation will protect you.
[3:33:10] But when you have the Holy Ghost,
[3:33:13] you will fight on
[3:33:17] sometimes.
[3:33:20] Things can go wrong. But still
[3:33:29] in the ring fighting and one of these
[3:33:32] days the honors which you have been
[3:33:34] given
[3:33:35] the full payment will come. Oh
[3:33:37] hallelujah.
[3:33:44] We have a house
[3:33:46] tabernacle building of God.
[3:33:50] Not men with hands.
[3:33:54] Hallelujah.
[3:33:57] Not according to dust man of Genesis 2
[3:34:03] of Genesis 1,
[3:34:07] not with
[3:34:13] eternal in the heavens.
[3:34:16] In this we grown
[3:34:19] honestly desiring
[3:34:22] desiring
[3:34:24] to be closed
[3:34:28] with our house
[3:34:30] which is from heaven.
[3:34:32] If so be that being closed we shall not
[3:34:36] be found naked.
[3:34:40] For we that are in this tabernacle
[3:34:44] do grown
[3:34:47] being burdened,
[3:34:49] not for that we would be uncloed,
[3:34:55] but we want to be clothed
[3:34:57] that mortality,
[3:35:00] mortality
[3:35:03] might be swallowed up of life.
[3:35:07] Now he has wrote us
[3:35:10] For the selfs same thing is God who also
[3:35:14] has given us the unness of
[3:35:21] he is the one who has put us
[3:35:25] the earnest
[3:35:29] to confirm
[3:35:32] we must finish this. Hallelujah.
[3:35:35] Therefore, we are always confident
[3:35:39] knowing that while we are at home in
[3:35:42] this body,
[3:35:44] we are absent from the Lord.
[3:35:47] But we walk by faith,
[3:35:51] not by sight.
[3:35:54] We are confident, I say, and willing
[3:35:57] rather to be absent from the body
[3:36:01] and to be present with the Lord.
[3:36:03] Whereof we labor that whether present or
[3:36:08] absent
[3:36:10] we may be accepted of him.
[3:36:13] There are two ways we can make it. We
[3:36:17] can go by the way of the grave.
[3:36:19] Those who die. The Bible says in
[3:36:22] Thessalonians
[3:36:23] they will rise up again. Do you know
[3:36:26] what they will do? When they rise, you
[3:36:28] know when they die they get their fear
[3:36:30] for the body. But when they they they
[3:36:34] they on the resurrection morning,
[3:36:36] they'll come back again here on the
[3:36:38] earth to pick their glorified body.
[3:36:44] Why? Because corruptible
[3:36:48] has to put on incorruption.
[3:36:52] Are you following me?
[3:36:55] Oh my. When Jesus died and went to the
[3:36:58] grave and he rose, the body did not
[3:37:01] remain there.
[3:37:04] What happened? That body
[3:37:07] dressed another body and the other body
[3:37:12] dissolved
[3:37:15] and Jesus had a glorified body.
[3:37:21] Let me tell you, those who die in Christ
[3:37:25] shall rise fast and they will be also
[3:37:27] clothed
[3:37:29] with a glorified body. And we which are
[3:37:31] alive and remain, let me tell you
[3:37:33] brother, this one is going to dissolve.
[3:37:37] So the quickening power that is in us is
[3:37:42] going to quicken us and change us and we
[3:37:45] shall put on corruption.
[3:37:48] [Music]
[3:37:50] [Applause]
[3:37:53] will be glorified.
[3:37:55] We can appear and disappear.
[3:37:58] We can eat food like Jesus.
[3:38:02] Hallelujah. We will be here in a
[3:38:04] millennia.
[3:38:06] What are you talking about?
[3:38:08] Hallelujah. We are redeemed.
[3:38:15] I can almost preach for the whole day.
[3:38:20] Friends,
[3:38:24] I thank you. I thank you Jesus.
[3:38:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[3:38:29] We are redeemed.
[3:38:31] Let us stand our feet saints.
[3:38:34] Give him a clap of praise.
[3:38:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:38:42] Hallelujah.
[3:38:45] Soon we shall have our redeemed bodies.
[3:38:52] Corruption
[3:38:54] will put on incorruption,
[3:38:56] no more temptation,
[3:38:58] no more worries,
[3:39:01] no more sin,
[3:39:03] no more poverty,
[3:39:05] no more problems.
[3:39:08] the scholars,
[3:39:10] no more books,
[3:39:13] [Music]
[3:39:14] no more jobs to do.
[3:39:18] Everything will be done.
[3:39:22] But for now,
[3:39:25] if you have not received the Holy Ghost,
[3:39:27] you need to receive the Holy Ghost
[3:39:29] because you are you have left you are
[3:39:30] left behind.
[3:39:33] If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you
[3:39:35] can't receive the final pay.
[3:39:41] You can't receive the full redemption.
[3:39:45] The Holy Spirit is your redemption as an
[3:39:49] earnest.
[3:39:52] How do you receive the Holy Spirit?
[3:39:54] Repent and be baptized every one of you
[3:39:56] in the name of God.
[3:39:59] And when you do that, your sins will be
[3:40:01] washed away and he will fill you with
[3:40:04] the Holy Spirit.
[3:40:08] If he's still filled, I'm baptized.
[3:40:11] I I I I can't say I have received the
[3:40:14] Holy Spirit.
[3:40:17] Wow.
[3:40:18] He cannot lie.
[3:40:22] Whatever God says is true.
[3:40:26] So you have to receive the Holy Spirit.
[3:40:28] You must receive the voice.
[3:40:31] As simple as that.
[3:40:33] And what do you why need you to do?
[3:40:36] Ask
[3:40:37] &gt;&gt; and he shall receive.
[3:40:40] Knock and it shall be offered. Be hungry
[3:40:44] for him.
[3:40:46] In your heart the Lord Jesus.
[3:40:49] Lift up your hand and say Lord.
[3:40:52] You know it can even happen now.
[3:40:58] You lift up your hands and say, "Lord,
[3:41:01] feel me." Now,
[3:41:04] the Holy Spirit is not God doing
[3:41:05] something for you because he's giving
[3:41:06] you a reward.
[3:41:11] It is a promise which he promised to all
[3:41:15] as an earnest of their redemption.
[3:41:20] And when you are ready, he's ready.
[3:41:23] He was ready before you were ready.
[3:41:26] I remember even when you received the
[3:41:27] Holy Spirit, you are still in this
[3:41:30] tabernacle.
[3:41:32] But then you need him to fight.
[3:41:35] So since I was baptized, there's been
[3:41:38] battles. That's a sign.
[3:41:41] Something is happening in
[3:41:44] the battle increased.
[3:41:46] The fighting has been intense.
[3:41:48] That's a sign that you have now entered
[3:41:51] the ring
[3:41:53] only by the Holy Ghost.
[3:41:55] You will overcome.
[3:41:57] You will overcome.
[3:41:59] You have to fight to reign.
[3:42:03] Praise God.
[3:42:05] Don't you feel lovely?
[3:42:08] Close your eyes everybody. The Holy
[3:42:10] Spirit is here now.
[3:42:12] He can prove to you what I just preached
[3:42:13] to you.
[3:42:15] So you as an individual, you can receive
[3:42:18] a surge of the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3:42:24] he can fill you. And I want you to
[3:42:27] imagine
[3:42:29] is he not able to fulfill his word.
[3:42:33] So what is the Holy Spirit? It is the
[3:42:36] supernatural life of God.
[3:42:40] part of your theology of
[3:42:44] part of the work
[3:42:47] being made alive in you
[3:42:49] so that you can be able to exercise your
[3:42:52] free will
[3:42:55] by his guidance
[3:42:58] and when he comes in you just like a
[3:43:00] baby chs and shouts
[3:43:04] you know you you will have an emotion
[3:43:07] that's why you feel the way you
[3:43:10] Some of you even as I'm speaking right
[3:43:12] now,
[3:43:14] something is happening in your life.
[3:43:17] Something is happening in your life.
[3:43:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Wow.
[3:43:23] Amen.
[3:43:25] I can only say it because it has been
[3:43:27] revealed to me.
[3:43:30] Praise God.
[3:43:32] Look, just lift up your hands and say,
[3:43:33] Lord,
[3:43:35] feel me now.
[3:43:38] your power. That's the power to live for
[3:43:40] him
[3:43:43] in this world which is sin stricken.
[3:43:46] We can't do it without him
[3:43:50] more than anything.
[3:43:54] You need that honesty
[3:43:56] and he is here to give you that down
[3:43:58] payment.
[3:44:00] You see, you don't have to mind about
[3:44:02] anybody
[3:44:03] who is around you. Your battles are
[3:44:06] yours. because you know and you might as
[3:44:08] well fight this one and not lose this
[3:44:10] one and say Lord I I this is my moment.
[3:44:14] It's my time. I need to be filled. I
[3:44:17] need to be filled with the earnest of
[3:44:19] your power
[3:44:21] that I may be able to fight and I be
[3:44:24] able to win.
[3:44:27] [Music]
[3:44:28] You may have been filled before
[3:44:32] when he can he can he can refuse.
[3:44:36] You see where you what you received
[3:44:38] where it came from there is much more.
[3:44:41] You can never finish God.
[3:44:44] He overflows.
[3:44:47] Let him fill your cup
[3:44:49] and then let your soul overflow
[3:44:53] with his spirit.
[3:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:44:58] Amen. You young people,
[3:45:01] some of you cannot overcome without it.
[3:45:04] You need the Holy Spirit.
[3:45:07] Think about the battle you're fighting.
[3:45:09] How can you make it without you? Tell
[3:45:11] him, "Lord Jesus, I am desperate for
[3:45:14] you. I fill you now. Feel me now."
[3:45:18] That's the only prayer you can pray
[3:45:19] right now.
[3:45:21] That way, it will be granted.
[3:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You have to be desperate for
[3:45:27] him.
[3:45:29] You cannot do it.
[3:45:32] If you have hazard,
[3:45:36] you are not letting go.
[3:45:39] You are not letting loose.
[3:45:41] You are still in your own little world.
[3:45:44] You need to be free
[3:45:46] because the Holy Ghost is a spirit of
[3:45:49] God that goes off and beyond your
[3:45:52] humanity.
[3:45:55] So you have to let your humanity down.
[3:45:58] If the Lord of heaven can humble himself
[3:46:01] to a form of a
[3:46:04] how about you today? Can't you humble
[3:46:06] yourself and ask him to feel you? Can't
[3:46:10] you accept me vulnerable?
[3:46:13] I I don't even know what I'm doing. I
[3:46:15] believe it is him him pulling for you.
[3:46:22] So, don't let don't don't let it pass by
[3:46:25] you.
[3:46:27] You may say, "Well, I'm a sinner. I'm a
[3:46:29] big time sinner. I've done a lot of
[3:46:30] things."
[3:46:32] Come on, sister. Come on, brother.
[3:46:35] That's the reason I'm asking you to
[3:46:36] receive the Holy Ghost.
[3:46:39] You too can receive. Because when you
[3:46:41] receive the Holy Ghost, the things that
[3:46:43] overcame you before
[3:46:45] will not by any means overcome you again
[3:46:48] because you will have the power to
[3:46:49] overcome.
[3:46:51] Receive you the Holy Ghost. Receive you
[3:46:53] the Holy Ghost right now in the name of
[3:46:56] Jesus Christ. Lift up your hands and
[3:46:58] receive him.
[3:47:00] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Right now,
[3:47:03] not tomorrow, right now.
[3:47:06] &gt;&gt; Believe him.
[3:47:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Jesus.

[4:10:58] don't request for comfort on a meeting
[4:11:00] like
[4:11:03] It means there is one or two people who
[4:11:05] have sponsored it.
[4:11:09] That's just what it means. And it means
[4:11:12] that all the blessings are going to
[4:11:14] that.
[4:11:17] And we don't want that. We want to be a
[4:11:20] support.
[4:11:22] Last night, yesterday I spoke to Pastor
[4:11:24] John and I was asking him, is there
[4:11:26] something we can do?
[4:11:30] So um we as a church are intending to
[4:11:33] support both conventions.
[4:11:37] We are collecting a lot of money money
[4:11:38] for this money.
[4:11:41] We have decided not to collect
[4:11:44] but I would like you to all of you
[4:11:46] before you leave before you leave to
[4:11:48] meet brother Daniel back there
[4:11:54] if you want to support the meeting or
[4:11:56] something.
[4:11:58] Whatever you put, we shall send it to
[4:11:59] them.
[4:12:01] We shall add something and then send it
[4:12:03] to you. If you don't, I'm determined to
[4:12:07] send something to each
[4:12:10] You let me take the blessing alone.
[4:12:14] I hope not. You can tap from that
[4:12:17] blessing.
[4:12:19] Amen. So pray for me. I'm going to be
[4:12:23] away from Tuesday
[4:12:26] preaching in northern Ethiopia.
[4:12:31] That's a completely new area. No church
[4:12:33] but we have a few members
[4:12:36] and also it's not politically safe
[4:12:42] but you need to remember us in prayers
[4:12:44] there you shall come also minister in
[4:12:45] adab
