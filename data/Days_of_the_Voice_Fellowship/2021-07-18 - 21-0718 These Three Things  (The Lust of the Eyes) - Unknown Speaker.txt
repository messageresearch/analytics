i would like to take this moment lord to thank you for giving us this opportunity to be i pray that your holy spirit will be able to guide us i pray that you will speak to each and every one of us let that life that was in jesus christ dwell in each of us [Music] [Music] um we are reading first john chapter 2 verse 15. is come here let's do it love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him a month for all that is in the world the last of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but he is of the world to be very and the world passes away and the last they arrow but hey that do with the will of god abides forever but i wanted to look at it again it says and the world passes away did you hear that is your maturity can every one of you tell your neighbor the world passes tell your neighbor the world passes away right now and see eggs and he says the last thereof but he that do with the will of god can we now go have our seats if you're standing by doing me today now since this morning by the grace of god i would like to uh pick up from where i stopped last sunday nandia got dented and declared nakama sunday wednesday and uh i would like to take a party too of the subject these three [Applause] so i would like to uh request for your undivided attention i know it is quite difficult for us to have online chats because when you are in the church here there are deacons or people who usher you and they kind of watch you your behavior and so they make sure that everything is is is going well come on it is usually quite difficult for you to be attentive second thing through h.o.k and while i am speaking on these subjects i have the young people at heart but also the older ones alike these things are affecting not only the younger ones but both the old and the young alike these three [Applause] in these three things that's why my subject is these three things and on sunday last we spoke on the last of the flesh this sunday of this morning i'd like us to speak on the last of the eyes he emphasizes and he says the things that he says love not the world again neither the things that are in the world no one converted into every demon so there are many things in the world and again someone will simulate injuries are the things that are in the world so which means that there are people who can be in charge but having the love of the world they can be in church but they are loving the things that [Music] right what are the things that are in the world the lust of the flesh will be the last of the eyes and the pride of life [Applause] i do not apologize to be a believer no way jose jones i do not apologize to do the will of god [Applause] because i know i will abide forever [Applause] but is that thing which you last after but when the origin of that last is from your body from your flesh and now by the end of the service you may realize that many of you might have been somehow somewhere at one point in your life or maybe even now overtaken by the last of the eyes some people think the last of the eyes is only only the fornicators have it and i'll begin reading the with a i'll begin with this uh quote from the church edge book relation let me get a brief squad we read this also last sunday wherein jesus is tempted of the devil our yes we are coming by satan he overcame the personal temptations of saturn by the word and by the word only never overcome by your own power [Applause] um somehow try to make sure you find some youtube youtube amen you know internet has you it has been used by the devil to kill very many young people but i always say just like david used the sword of goliath to kill him [Applause] as the bride of jesus christ christ we as the church of nazareth also use the very something happened and now i [Applause] [Music] yes that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the last of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life came of your name since [Applause] he fell to the personal temptation of saturn by failing to use the word [Music] sin and to me it's not the things you do is similar interview collab sin is not fornication sin is not adultery is not drunkenness sin is not smoking you've seen because she failed to [Music] [Music] is the in your life tell them hallelujah you apply the as always i don't always believe in the lengthy preaching but somehow when the holocaust comes down you just spare with me a little more and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant for the eye to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one white she took of the fruit they wrote and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it [Music] oh [Applause] not available [Applause] oh i tell you this is so beautiful the last of the eyes the last of the eyes so tell somebody that is the last of the eyes so you know it is that thing which you know it appeals to you you desire to have it go [Music] oh is [Music] they [Applause] [Applause] it is okay hallelujah amen john emphasizes that these three physical things do not last your camera can be retrieved it does not last they will pass away you see but god is and how he overcame yes because you you are a failure to begin with always take away the words and you come to your singer you are not your sister the power of god man you gotta control the rest of jesus that gave you the power to overcome your quran not dormant the word is activated by the power of jesus christ the messiah jesus christ is now listen matthew chapter 4 verse 11. the devil takes keep up and exiting my mouth [Music] [Applause] hollywood all those things [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] i don't know [Applause] [Applause] jesus teaching me sir please listen to me without preaching the gospel of the eyes when you come to jesus christ foreign amen i will fall down and worship single government [Music] today single guarantee the lord is good what is that verse 11. then the devil leaves him and behold him just came and ministered unto him jesus said unto him get thee and satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve yes sister gloria where are you god bless you yesterday hallelujah hallelujah young people right here can you see any of you better [Applause] hallelujah okay there is a place for a child of god to be you to be one way forward i said there is a place for you to be following your creator jesus overcame satan yes he knew who he was he separated the air from here he was separated from everything else may it is tonight that when god calls men brother isaac where's the quote hallelujah [Applause] god [Applause] that if it would be necessary [Applause] god wants you to get to that place if it is necessary [Music] what [Applause] [Music] but it is [Applause] trying to place that before this he says he says it is all right don't misunderstand me to have those things but it says do not try to place it before this before the reality is of course they said that to make them feel good but listen there was a very little time now i can say that that god gets you away from all your associates buddies all those bodies that the wisdom of the world becomes so insufficient against anymore then he used to be like oh let me take it out repent tomorrow my i'll tell you i tell you now it will come you'll be like what is that catalyzer at the last of the eyes will get so deep that you can't see those things anymore put that off i want to ask you a question i wanted you to business let me put you up here so i can be able to speak up [Music] now oh [Applause] uh oh foreign when someone gives you money you'll
