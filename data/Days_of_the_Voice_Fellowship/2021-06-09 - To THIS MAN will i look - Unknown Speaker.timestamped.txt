[5:43] amen i want to greet the three of you
[5:46] that are here
[5:47] in the name of jesus christ and also
[5:50] the three connections uh on zoom
[5:53] i'm happy to see sister lydia brother
[5:56] joel and the family there
[5:58] and uh may the lord bless you and
[6:01] those that are gathered at my home now
[6:03] we did not announce
[6:07] to the believers yet that we shall be
[6:09] connecting by zoom
[6:11] as those of you are here and and
[6:14] some of you already know we are in
[6:18] lockdown here again
[6:20] so we cannot be able to meet uh
[6:23] i'm trying to see whether my audio
[6:28] okay brother joel is asking for the link
[6:30] just get a link for my status
[6:33] you can be able to share that with
[6:35] whoever wants it
[6:37] uh i hope my audio is fine now uh
[6:40] we have not yet announced the believers
[6:42] how we are going to be doing this
[6:44] but i think we shall this is the way to
[6:45] go we'll just be doing it by zoom
[6:47] because for
[6:48] a period of uh two two months we are not
[6:51] going to be able to meet in the church
[6:54] because of the soaring
[6:58] cases of the covet but i believe that
[7:00] god will give us grace
[7:02] to go through it again amen
[7:06] so let us just start use a few minutes
[7:08] uh
[7:09] probably about 30 or 40 minutes just uh
[7:13] i thought it is a must as much as i had
[7:15] not announced it but it is a must
[7:17] to fellowship and and give the world the
[7:20] bible says that we should be
[7:22] ready in season and out of season
[7:26] amen and so it looks like out of season
[7:28] this time
[7:29] but we don't have to sleep and say that
[7:32] i will not do it
[7:33] now uh i do not think that there is
[7:36] anybody who needs interpretation
[7:38] uh if there seems to be somebody i'll
[7:40] let you know
[7:42] all right let us go to isaiah 66.
[7:45] if there is anyone who needs
[7:46] interpretation please just
[7:49] send us uh send us a text so we can be
[7:52] able to have the brother interpret
[7:54] uh isaiah 66 verse one two five
[7:58] brother kelo i'm happy to see you i know
[8:01] that you have uh been battling as well
[8:05] uh how are you now yeah i can see you're
[8:09] strong
[8:09] we thank god we thank god i believe many
[8:12] people were infected but
[8:13] the grace of god is taking us through
[8:16] brother kelly you came here on sunday
[8:18] and i know you couldn't even finish the
[8:20] service
[8:21] but we thank god that he has given you
[8:23] grace and healing
[8:26] thus faith the lord i'm reading from
[8:27] verse 1 of isaiah 66
[8:30] that saith the lord the heaven is my
[8:32] throne and the earth is my food still
[8:35] where is the house that he built unto me
[8:37] and where is the place of my rest
[8:39] for all those things has mine hand made
[8:42] and all those things
[8:43] have been saith the lord but to this man
[8:45] will i look even to him that is of a
[8:48] poor and of a contrite spirit
[8:49] and trembleth at my word he that killeth
[8:52] an ox is as if he's
[8:53] you a man and he that sacrifices alarm
[8:56] as if he cut off a dog's neck
[8:58] he that offereth an oblation uh as if he
[9:01] offered swans blood
[9:02] he that burneth incense as if he blessed
[9:05] an idol
[9:06] yeah they have chosen their ways their
[9:09] own ways and they are
[9:10] so delighted in their own abominations
[9:13] amen may the lord bless you and bless
[9:16] his word you may have your seats
[9:18] and by the shame i don't think you may
[9:20] want to tamper with that until as
[9:22] we hear that if somebody says the
[9:24] because you cannot be able to monitor
[9:27] the sound for now
[9:31] okay but uh i think but brother joel or
[9:34] sister
[9:36] can you tell us if the audio is fine
[9:38] before we
[9:39] we start the sharing is the audio fine
[9:42] you can answer that through whatsapp or
[9:44] just through the
[9:45] your whatsapp the zoom
[9:49] message so that i am sure that the audio
[9:52] is fine
[9:53] and no one is answering me so i can't
[9:55] continue i do not know if the audio is
[9:57] fine
[9:58] okay he just said it is fine now
[10:01] uh i i was trying to connect
[10:04] this on the on the new channel that i
[10:07] just created
[10:08] uh called days of the voice fellowship
[10:10] on youtube
[10:12] but as i somehow failed
[10:15] because i had not tried to to use the
[10:17] new channel yet
[10:18] uh the other channel the message site i
[10:20] just wanted to leave it for
[10:22] uh the outreach mainly you know because
[10:25] these are long meetings one hour or so
[10:27] and uh but the other channel i'm just
[10:30] really
[10:30] been praying and thinking about
[10:32] continuing to make some of these clips
[10:34] that we made in in our sign your house
[10:36] is the lydia
[10:38] uh the lord willing we shall be able to
[10:40] make more of this
[10:41] here uh just for the for the outreach
[10:44] so the other channel i'll leave it for
[10:45] that and uh
[10:47] and then uh the uh this other new
[10:50] channel which i created we can be able
[10:52] to use it to stream the
[10:54] uh the meetings the meetings here for
[10:56] whosoever
[10:57] may want to stream that from from the
[10:59] youtube later
[11:00] so but for now i think i'll have to just
[11:02] either upload this later
[11:04] or we'll just have to begin streaming
[11:07] from another service so i would like
[11:10] i've already
[11:11] preached on this two times so i want to
[11:14] have
[11:14] uh to take to speak on it again this
[11:17] that time
[11:19] to this but to this man will i look and
[11:21] i take that from uh
[11:23] i take that from this verse
[11:28] verses two for all those things as my
[11:30] handmade and all these
[11:32] those things have been saith the lord
[11:34] but to this man
[11:35] will i look uh even to him that is of a
[11:38] poor and of a contrite spirit and
[11:39] trembleth
[11:40] at my word so suddenly you have been
[11:42] following and you know
[11:44] from verse one we have been able to see
[11:46] god saying that
[11:47] everything that is he is the one who has
[11:50] created it the heaven and the earth
[11:52] and everything therein the heaven is his
[11:55] throne and the earth is his footstool so
[11:56] which house
[11:57] can you build for the lord and indeed we
[11:59] found out that there is no house
[12:01] we can be able to build for the lord
[12:02] because he does not delight in a
[12:05] physical building
[12:06] he does not delight in a physical house
[12:08] in a physical uh focused building but
[12:11] he has something that he delights in and
[12:13] he has been able to say
[12:14] on verse two he says that for all those
[12:16] things his hand has made
[12:18] but then he says but i will look to this
[12:20] man will i look
[12:21] but to this man will i look now which
[12:24] man is he speaking of we have been able
[12:26] to
[12:27] in detail uh talk about this man and uh
[12:30] i first of all in the uh previous
[12:33] service i was able to
[12:34] we went a little bit in the godhead some
[12:37] of you might have thought it was a
[12:38] little off topic but it wasn't because
[12:41] uh it was jesus that was the perfect
[12:45] manifestation
[12:46] of the of god as you see
[12:50] in the book of malachi chapter 3
[12:53] and i think we shall read it quickly
[12:55] malachi chapter 3
[12:57] i did speak of this but i did not read
[12:59] it previously so let's read it
[13:01] malachi 3 1 he says behold i will send
[13:05] my messenger
[13:06] and he shall prepare the way before me
[13:08] and the lord whom you seek
[13:09] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[13:11] the messenger of the covenant whom ye
[13:13] the light in
[13:14] behold they shall come saith the lord of
[13:16] hosts so the messenger of the covenant
[13:19] is the same as the lord okay
[13:22] he is the one who made the covenant with
[13:25] uh
[13:25] with noah that he would not let the wild
[13:28] or
[13:28] not destroy the earth with water again
[13:30] and he put that
[13:31] [Music]
[13:32] rainbow as a sign as a convent as a sign
[13:35] of the covenant that they made or to
[13:37] seal the covenant that they made
[13:39] and so then here we notice that is the
[13:41] also the one that
[13:42] uh swore by himself to be able to do the
[13:45] work of redemption or the work of
[13:46] salvation
[13:47] and also we see he says that and the
[13:49] lord whom he is sick of course the jews
[13:51] at this time they were seeking for the
[13:53] lord of hosts the
[13:55] god of glory the the one who was the
[13:57] creator of heaven and earth the god of
[13:58] abraham
[13:59] isaac and jacob and he says the lord
[14:02] whom he is sick
[14:03] will now come in his temple suddenly
[14:05] will come in his temple
[14:06] now suddenly before anybody would know
[14:08] anyone would find out
[14:10] before even the religious man would
[14:12] figure out
[14:13] amen who that god is he would suddenly
[14:15] come in his temple
[14:16] and we notice that that temple in the
[14:18] new testament jesus christ picks up the
[14:20] scripture
[14:22] and he says you can destroy this temple
[14:24] you can destroy this temple in one day
[14:26] and i will be able to raise it up in
[14:28] three days and of course they thought he
[14:30] was meaning the temple the body
[14:32] uh the building rather the building of
[14:34] solomon
[14:35] the temple of solomon and they were so
[14:37] sad they were angry actually at him
[14:40] how can you destroy this temple in how
[14:42] can you destroy
[14:43] and and how can you raise it up in three
[14:46] days
[14:47] when we have built it for very many
[14:49] years i think it was about 40 years
[14:52] 40 something years we've raised this
[14:54] temple for over 40 years
[14:56] and you being one man you were actually
[14:58] saying that you can raise it up in three
[15:00] days
[15:01] so this was offensive for them because
[15:03] they did not understand
[15:05] that jesus was no longer speaking of the
[15:07] building made with hands
[15:08] he was now speaking over a more holy
[15:11] temple he was now speaking of a more
[15:13] precious temple he was now speaking of a
[15:16] temple that was not made with hands
[15:18] a temple that he himself built a house
[15:21] where amen he would be housed he would
[15:24] be able to dwell
[15:25] now god had changed the dwelling place
[15:27] he was no longer dwelling in the holy of
[15:30] holies and somebody was asking me that
[15:31] what is the shekinah glory
[15:33] the sheikah glory is the presence of god
[15:35] that dwelt
[15:36] in the holy of holies and that no man
[15:38] was uh was able to end all would enter
[15:41] there
[15:42] but only he that was sanctified only he
[15:44] that was
[15:45] ready and worthy to enter in and uh that
[15:48] was the high priest
[15:49] and he also did not enter in whenever he
[15:51] wanted he entered in
[15:53] that place once in a year and
[15:56] he entered in there to be able to stand
[15:59] between or to
[16:01] uh to to uh uh to mediate
[16:04] for the sins his own and and those of
[16:07] his brethren
[16:08] and uh he would enter in there as we saw
[16:11] with chains on
[16:12] on his uh or you know tied on him
[16:16] in case he fell down they could not even
[16:18] enter in there
[16:19] all they had to do is to pull him out
[16:21] because that was the holiest of holy
[16:24] it was where god dwelled it was where
[16:26] the act of the covenant
[16:27] was it was where the presence of god was
[16:29] it was where the shekinah glory was
[16:32] and so in there was life and god himself
[16:35] dwelt in there
[16:36] so the jews respected that place the
[16:38] jews respected the temple of solomon
[16:40] because the temple of solomon was the
[16:41] dwelling place of god literally dwelling
[16:43] place of god himself
[16:45] amen god who dwelled in heaven
[16:48] amen now had come down among the men
[16:50] tapping accord with men
[16:52] in that temple of solomon but now notice
[16:54] when
[16:55] jesus christ came amen he had now
[16:59] transferred the dwelling or the coming
[17:01] of jesus
[17:02] transfer the dwelling place of god from
[17:05] just the building which was
[17:07] made with the hands of men to allow
[17:10] a building which was created by god
[17:13] himself
[17:14] you know he would say which which which
[17:16] place will you will you build for me
[17:19] which dwelling place will you make for
[17:20] me which house would you make for me
[17:23] heaven is my throne and the earth is my
[17:24] footstool
[17:25] so which place which which place will
[17:27] you build for me that my hand does not
[17:29] mean
[17:29] and so we see that there was no place
[17:31] but the one that he himself had created
[17:34] by the spoken word
[17:36] and jesus christ actually is the spoken
[17:38] word of god
[17:39] jesus christ is the flesh is god himself
[17:41] spoken into the
[17:43] human body and so we see that he was
[17:45] that temple
[17:46] the temple now was transferred from
[17:48] being the temple of solomon
[17:50] it was now jesus christ so jesus was now
[17:53] at that time the temple of god
[17:56] so notice but we
[18:00] have to take it from there 2000 years
[18:02] ago because when we talk about jesus as
[18:04] being the temple of god
[18:05] we are talking about what happened 2000
[18:08] years ago
[18:08] but we have to take it also from 2000
[18:11] years ago and bring it to our time now
[18:13] what is
[18:15] what place what house will we build for
[18:17] the lord what will be the dwelling place
[18:19] of god is now no longer
[18:20] also the body the literal body of jesus
[18:23] because it's no longer here on earth
[18:26] but there's another body amen a body
[18:29] which
[18:30] amen he has prepared for himself to
[18:33] dwell in
[18:34] it's no longer the body of the literal
[18:36] man jesus but it's the body of jesus
[18:38] christ here on after day
[18:40] amen which is you and me amen which is
[18:42] the
[18:43] the bodies of the the the the hearts of
[18:46] the predestinated
[18:48] amen those seeds of god who have been
[18:49] known before the foundation of the world
[18:51] amen that they will receive eternal life
[18:54] those are the ones that god would like
[18:55] to dwell
[18:56] in today in our generation that's why he
[18:59] says but to this man
[19:01] we like luke at the time of jesus he was
[19:03] able to look unto him and even
[19:05] sounded him and the voice from the
[19:07] heavens and he said
[19:09] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[19:12] pleased
[19:12] of course to dwell in and we see that
[19:14] that at that time was jesus but today
[19:17] amen it is me says jesus it is you the
[19:20] body
[19:21] amen that he is calling in amen
[19:24] we the body of christ on earth today the
[19:27] body of christ is
[19:28] all over the world it's not in one place
[19:30] it's not in one fellowship
[19:32] it's all over the world and that body of
[19:34] christ
[19:36] is they that have had the gospel
[19:39] believed the gospel filled with the holy
[19:41] ghost amen going through those three
[19:43] stages of grace
[19:44] they've been called by the grace of god
[19:47] and
[19:47] justified and have been sanctified and
[19:50] they have been
[19:51] filled with the holy ghost they are the
[19:54] body
[19:54] of our lord jesus christ and and then he
[19:56] says but to this man
[19:58] will i look and we notice that he is he
[20:01] says that
[20:01] what type of a man the man that is of a
[20:04] poor and
[20:05] a contract spirit and he that trembleth
[20:08] at my word at his word
[20:10] we noticed that i also took you through
[20:13] the genesis and we talked a little bit
[20:15] about cain we talked about abel
[20:18] and we examined each of them and saw
[20:20] that cain
[20:22] did not have a faculty within him
[20:25] to receive the word because cain was
[20:28] serpent seed
[20:29] no matter what you would do no matter
[20:31] how many preachers would preach to him
[20:33] no matter how anointed the preacher
[20:35] would be
[20:35] he could not move the heart of cain
[20:37] because cain did not have a seed
[20:40] jam in him that would be able to sprout
[20:42] out
[20:43] that would be able to bring forth life
[20:45] you see cain was a serpent
[20:47] uh seed he was the seed of the serpent
[20:49] he was not the seed of god
[20:51] and and and today we have that seed in
[20:54] the world today
[20:55] you see all people in the world are not
[20:57] equal no matter how
[20:58] much you want to make them equal all of
[21:01] them are not equal
[21:02] and somebody told me so you mean god is
[21:03] a segregationist
[21:05] i said well i do not know how you want
[21:07] to understand it but
[21:08] here is what i believe that all human
[21:10] beings on
[21:11] on this earth are not of the same seed
[21:14] amen there are those
[21:15] the bible says are the children of the
[21:17] devil and there are those that the bible
[21:18] says are the children of god
[21:20] and then the bible says that they that
[21:22] are born of god
[21:23] amen do not sin why can they not sin
[21:27] because the seed of god remains in them
[21:30] so no matter how much you would like to
[21:33] bring the equality and
[21:34] try to say that all human beings on this
[21:36] earth are equal and they
[21:38] are entitled to the same rights that's
[21:40] not the god i know
[21:41] the god i know has only one right
[21:45] that he has given to every believer or
[21:47] not even a believer
[21:48] to every human being and that right is
[21:50] the right to make a choice
[21:52] be it serpent seed or goddess seed they
[21:55] have
[21:56] even their free moral agents they can be
[21:58] able to decide what is it that they want
[22:00] to do
[22:01] what is it that they want to live what
[22:02] kind of life they want to live
[22:04] what kind of thing they want to do where
[22:06] they want to go
[22:07] what they want to do what they want to
[22:09] be god doesn't decide those things for
[22:11] you
[22:12] no matter what is in your heart you
[22:14] decide hey don't think they can do those
[22:16] kind of things for you
[22:17] you know god has made you a free moral
[22:19] agent so that well of course
[22:21] he being god he for one knew
[22:24] he knew what would be but he never made
[22:27] what
[22:27] was to be do you understand what i'm
[22:29] what i'm saying
[22:30] he knew what would be he knew that he
[22:32] would be a believer but he never tried
[22:34] to pull you
[22:35] and enforce you and and make you a
[22:38] believer no
[22:39] you had the word you had the gospel and
[22:41] when you hear the gospel in your heart
[22:43] you yourself you receive it and accept
[22:45] it why because
[22:46] in your heart there is a seed of god and
[22:48] now when you accept it god knew that you
[22:50] would accept it why because within your
[22:52] heart is a seed to believe
[22:54] but god never uh coerced or foster
[22:57] or moved on on your heart and and and
[23:00] forced you
[23:00] but he moved on your heart and them and
[23:03] compelled you by his word
[23:06] for you to make a choice you see
[23:09] eve eve was a child of god
[23:12] you could say she was a seed of god but
[23:15] eve was the same
[23:17] why was she deceived she was deceived
[23:20] because she chose to be deceived she
[23:23] knew the word but she was
[23:24] deceived because she accepted she gave
[23:27] in
[23:28] amen now we have a right also amen to
[23:31] either give
[23:31] in to the devil or refuse the devil amen
[23:35] even what is going around now
[23:36] around the world called the coronavirus
[23:39] and killing very many people and even
[23:40] here in uganda many people starting to
[23:42] die
[23:43] and many other countries but here is
[23:44] what i want to tell you as believers
[23:46] yes we have to take all the
[23:48] precautionary measures but we have to
[23:50] understand
[23:51] that our goal the god we believe is much
[23:53] greater
[23:54] than any disease that would ever come on
[23:56] this planet
[23:57] whether it is formed in a laboratory or
[23:59] whether just coming as a pandemic or
[24:01] whether
[24:02] it is sent out from god i don't care
[24:04] what i want to believe
[24:05] as believers we we have to stand out
[24:08] amen against all these
[24:10] demons you see but what does the devil
[24:12] do the devil brings in fear in our
[24:14] hearts
[24:15] to make us disbelieve what god has said
[24:18] so that he can be able to take us away
[24:20] from our god-given rights and our
[24:22] god-given rights is to make a choice now
[24:24] we
[24:24] amen have made a choice to believe what
[24:27] god has said and god has said
[24:28] tell me that by my stripes you are
[24:31] healed
[24:32] amen and we should keep believing that
[24:35] but abandoned say that
[24:36] you know even if he prayed for i don't
[24:38] know how many thousands of people
[24:39] and each of them died they would still
[24:41] be preached and believe divine hearing
[24:44] why amen it's not about how many people
[24:46] have been healed
[24:47] when he prayed for them it's about how
[24:49] many people
[24:50] it's about his faith in the word of god
[24:52] it's about our faith in the word of god
[24:54] not about
[24:55] what we have seen happen but what we
[24:57] have heard him say
[24:59] he said it we believe it that settles it
[25:02] you believe that with all your heart
[25:04] hallelujah
[25:06] and so he says but to this man we like
[25:09] luke
[25:10] and then he begins to describe the kind
[25:11] of man that is going to even look at now
[25:15] why did he look at jesus did you know
[25:18] that when jesus was on this earth the
[25:20] whole
[25:21] eyes of heaven were upon him did you
[25:24] know that
[25:26] all heaven all heaven was on jesus
[25:31] and brother banham said that whatever
[25:33] was in god he powered in jesus
[25:35] he pardoned christ and whatever was in
[25:37] christ he powered in the church
[25:40] amen all the eyes of heaven was upon him
[25:44] why
[25:45] because he was even the begotten son of
[25:48] god
[25:48] he was a born of bones of god and nature
[25:51] of the nature of god the flesh
[25:53] of the flesh of god and every character
[25:56] that was in him
[25:57] was the character that was in god and so
[26:00] all eyes looked upon him did you know
[26:03] that jesus never did
[26:04] anything but what was written in the
[26:06] word about him
[26:08] you know they came john sent them go and
[26:12] find out if he
[26:13] is jesus and uh and uh
[26:16] uh and he said that uh they went to him
[26:20] and they tried to
[26:21] uh they tried to do them they asked him
[26:24] are you
[26:25] john said he sent us to you to ask you
[26:28] are you jesus
[26:29] are you the one oh we should wait for
[26:32] another
[26:34] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[26:38] and uh john answered rather jesus
[26:41] answered and told
[26:42] told them he said
[26:46] go and tell john what you have seen and
[26:48] heard me do
[26:50] because john knew jesus
[26:53] rather jesus knew that john was
[26:57] a bible prophet and that john
[27:01] would understand that if jesus
[27:04] was the messiah he would do everything
[27:08] the bible told or spoke of him
[27:12] so now if you want to know who you are
[27:16] if you want to know whether you're a
[27:17] seed of god if you want to know whether
[27:20] you're a child of god
[27:21] it's not difficult it's very easy
[27:24] the only thing you need to do my brother
[27:27] my sister
[27:28] is to ask somebody else
[27:31] ask your brother ask your sister how am
[27:34] i
[27:35] they will tell you by your works by your
[27:38] fruits
[27:40] he said by your by their fruits you
[27:42] shall know them
[27:45] by what you do and by what you say go
[27:48] and tell john
[27:50] what you have heard and what you have
[27:52] seen
[27:55] go and tell him it's by what you do and
[27:58] it's by what you say
[27:59] that's how we judge you that's how we
[28:02] judge you
[28:03] that's how we can be able to tell what
[28:05] kind of seed
[28:07] is in your heart and now we are able to
[28:10] know who jesus was
[28:12] not because he at any time said i am
[28:15] jesus the messiah
[28:16] but because of what he did what he did
[28:19] spoke of what he would do
[28:21] in the world when he comes
[28:24] he stood up and he knew right where the
[28:28] bible spoke of him and he took up
[28:30] the book of isaiah
[28:34] chapter what's this verse chapter 61 i
[28:38] believe it is
[28:40] you can open it up quickly
[28:44] praise the lord and he takes it and
[28:48] begins to read and he says the spirit of
[28:50] the lord god is upon me
[28:53] because the lord has anointed me to
[28:54] preach the good tidings unto the meek
[28:56] he has sent me to bind up the
[28:58] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[29:00] captives
[29:01] and the opening of the prison to them
[29:03] that are bound
[29:04] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[29:07] lord and he ended it
[29:09] there and he said everybody looked at
[29:12] him
[29:12] let us hear what you will say about the
[29:15] scripture
[29:16] remember what he's going to say will
[29:18] tell who he is
[29:20] this day is the scripture fulfilled in
[29:22] your ears
[29:23] what is said was exactly what was
[29:26] happening or what had happened at that
[29:28] time
[29:28] jesus even was invading himself
[29:32] amen as the savior of the world as the
[29:35] redeemer
[29:36] as the kinsman our kingsman redeemer as
[29:39] the one
[29:40] that came to declare the acceptable yeah
[29:42] of the lord
[29:44] he declared who he was amen by knowing
[29:48] what part of scripture spoke of him he
[29:51] knew what
[29:52] where he was in the word of god do you
[29:55] know where you are in the word of god
[29:56] now of course
[29:57] all eyes in heaven were upon jesus now
[30:00] we see
[30:01] today all eyes in heaven are upon you
[30:03] and me
[30:04] hallelujah and how do we know
[30:08] that we know that because it says but to
[30:10] this man now of course we are reading in
[30:12] isaiah 66 where we've been
[30:14] but to this man will i look which house
[30:17] will you be with me but to this man
[30:19] will i look even the man who has a poor
[30:22] uncontrolled spirit what is a poor and
[30:25] contrast spirit
[30:26] we did talk about that a little bit a
[30:28] poor and a conduit spirit is
[30:30] that kind of spirit that will receive
[30:32] the word
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] that kind of spirit that will tremble
[30:36] that kind of heart which will tremble at
[30:38] the word of god
[30:39] whatever the word of god says you
[30:40] believe regardless of your own opinion
[30:42] you will be ready to surrender your
[30:44] opinion for the word of god
[30:46] no matter how much you feel that this
[30:48] should be this way
[30:49] in your own opinion but what is god's
[30:53] word
[30:54] is no longer our opinion that is why we
[30:57] believe this message
[30:58] that is why we receive this message my
[31:00] brother my sister
[31:01] because we have desire to surrender our
[31:04] own opinions
[31:05] amen to receive the word of god
[31:08] regardless of what i think about it
[31:10] regardless of how i want it to be
[31:12] regardless of what i thought it should
[31:14] be amen is what god has said it should
[31:17] be
[31:18] not my opinion of what it should be
[31:21] hallelujah i will receive his word no
[31:24] matter what i think
[31:26] no matter what i want no matter what i
[31:28] feel
[31:29] i will receive his word if you
[31:32] also will be that way then he says to
[31:34] this man well i look
[31:36] such a man and on on on sunday
[31:39] i did speak a little bit about
[31:43] the the the three things that god is
[31:46] going to do
[31:47] as it comes in to take over your heart
[31:50] and i was reading a quote for you i
[31:52] never did finish it but i think i'll
[31:54] take that verse
[31:55] once again and read it and then finish
[31:57] up the other quote which i started
[31:58] and then we can finish for tonight and
[32:00] i'll sanctify now of course i'm reading
[32:02] in
[32:03] ezekiel chapter 36 to those who were not
[32:05] uh
[32:06] here on sunday ezekiel 36 23
[32:10] to 27 and i will sanctify
[32:14] and you'll forgive us we did not prepare
[32:16] to give you the quotes
[32:19] today it's the first time we are doing
[32:20] this zoom
[32:22] this zoom thing and i'll sanctify my
[32:25] great name which was profaned among the
[32:27] heathen
[32:28] which we have profaned in the midst of
[32:30] them all mine
[32:31] and the heathen shall know that i am the
[32:33] lord saith the lord god
[32:35] when i shall be sanctified in you before
[32:37] their eyes
[32:38] and i did speak and dwell on that march
[32:40] on sunday for i will take you from among
[32:42] the
[32:43] hidden and gather you out from or gather
[32:46] you out of all countries
[32:47] and i'll bring you into your own land
[32:50] then will i sprinkle clean water upon
[32:52] you
[32:53] and you shall be clean from all your
[32:55] filthiness and from all your idols
[32:57] will i cleanse you now many people come
[33:00] to the lord but they do not want to let
[33:02] go of their idols
[33:05] what is an idol an idol is something
[33:07] that you worship other than god
[33:09] and who is god god is a spirit but god
[33:11] is a
[33:12] a dwell god dwells in his own word
[33:16] and so an idol is something or that
[33:18] opinion of yours that you have
[33:21] that you cherish so much or higher than
[33:24] god
[33:25] and that kind of opinion it can be an
[33:26] opi opinion that you hold
[33:28] it can be a thought that you hold it can
[33:31] be a
[33:31] something that you have it can be
[33:33] anything whatever it is
[33:36] as long as it is anti-word it's against
[33:39] the word
[33:40] it is an idol but i'm gonna say that
[33:43] i'll clean
[33:43] you i will take you away from all these
[33:47] idols
[33:49] i'll bring you to your own land amen
[33:52] i'll take you from all these things
[33:55] and i'll take you from all your idols
[33:56] and i will cleanse you
[33:58] the desire the purpose of god for you
[34:01] and me my brother
[34:02] is for you for for us to be cleansed
[34:05] for us to be watched for us to be
[34:08] sanctified
[34:09] not only justified remember when he says
[34:11] i will take you
[34:13] it means i will justify you because
[34:16] justify
[34:17] means to be rendered sinless
[34:21] you were a sinner by choice amen
[34:24] an iron by birth but now you've been
[34:26] adopted
[34:27] you've been made sinless you've been
[34:29] made holy
[34:30] you've been made a child of god you've
[34:32] been made perfect
[34:34] before the sight of god even without you
[34:36] doing anything yet
[34:38] and that is justification when you hear
[34:42] the word of god
[34:43] and you receive it then it takes you
[34:45] from your idols
[34:46] that it takes you from the world and he
[34:48] takes it from the heathen from among the
[34:49] heathen
[34:50] that is justification and when he brings
[34:52] you down here then he says that i will
[34:54] cleanse you from all your idols
[34:58] then i'll cleanse you from all your
[34:59] opinions then i crazy from all your
[35:02] perspectives this is how i see it that's
[35:04] how i see it
[35:05] amen in this message it is no longer how
[35:08] you say it
[35:09] it is how god says it amen no matter
[35:13] even if all the world sees something in
[35:15] one way
[35:16] you will see it another way because god
[35:19] sees it another way
[35:22] such a message and a bad nego
[35:26] they were told to bow down they were
[35:29] told to bow down to an idol
[35:32] but because their god saw that in a
[35:36] wrong way in a bad way
[35:38] he saw that something wrong they
[35:41] also refused to bow down to the idol
[35:45] the king said when you hear the drums
[35:48] when you hear
[35:49] all kinds of music bow down
[35:52] and worship so you see we can go on that
[35:56] match but
[35:56] here's my point you see the king had
[35:59] everything arranged
[36:01] he had everything figured out how the
[36:04] people would be able to dance to his
[36:05] music
[36:07] and every day the purpose of the king of
[36:10] the world
[36:12] the purpose of the devil today is to
[36:14] make us
[36:15] dance to his music my brother he wants
[36:17] us to dance to his music
[36:19] he wants us to dash to his music and
[36:21] eventually he wants us to bow to his
[36:23] idols
[36:25] but god amen by his grace
[36:28] hallelujah he has given us a mind to
[36:31] understand his word he has given us
[36:34] a new mind he has given us a new
[36:36] understanding
[36:37] he has given us a new faith able to
[36:40] receive his word he has cleansed us from
[36:42] all our idols and when these people
[36:46] saw and heard the music they said we
[36:48] will not bow
[36:50] we will not bend we will not bow we will
[36:53] not bend
[36:55] my brothers and sisters let us not bow
[36:58] let us not bend no matter what the devil
[37:02] does
[37:03] let us not bow let us not bend
[37:06] and if there be any young person
[37:08] listening the others would could go
[37:10] in the dance parties and in the beer
[37:12] parties
[37:14] but you even whoever had the word of god
[37:16] and you've been released from your idols
[37:18] you will say i will not bow i will not
[37:21] bend
[37:22] they can go on with their smoking but
[37:24] for you you will not bow
[37:26] you're not burned they can go on with
[37:28] their alcoholism you will not bow
[37:30] you will not burn to these things they
[37:33] can go
[37:33] on even with their you know uh uh
[37:36] fornications and um one day i i
[37:39] i will speak on those three things the
[37:41] pride of life
[37:44] the last of the flesh and the last of
[37:46] the eyes
[37:47] i want to speak only on it probably when
[37:48] i'm done with this
[37:50] and i believe that the lord will bless
[37:52] you so much especially for the young
[37:53] people now
[37:54] i want you to understand that god by his
[37:57] grace
[37:58] is calling us out of all these things
[38:02] like message saddrish and a bad neighbor
[38:04] to say
[38:05] even if all the world forsake jesus
[38:09] even if all the world bows down and
[38:12] bends to the
[38:13] sound of the music of the king of the
[38:16] world
[38:17] i will not bow i will not bend do to me
[38:21] whatsoever you will
[38:23] and god has never forsaken his own god
[38:26] will not forsake us
[38:28] he will stand with us he will fight for
[38:30] us he he'll give us
[38:31] victory if we don't bow and if we don't
[38:34] bend
[38:37] the others can take the bribes and they
[38:39] can
[38:40] you know try to even some believers it
[38:44] is so it's a shame
[38:45] it is a shame you know some believers
[38:48] that try to put bribes in the bible
[38:52] and try to support it say if you're
[38:54] driving and
[38:55] a traffic officer arrests you then he is
[38:58] like well i'll take you to jail
[39:00] i'll take you to jail unless you you
[39:02] give me something so
[39:03] he says well settle with your with your
[39:05] neighbor before he takes you to court or
[39:07] whatever
[39:08] so that was how settle i would settle
[39:10] with her i'll settle with a traffic
[39:12] officer let me give him something small
[39:14] if you do that you have already bent
[39:16] your your back you have already bowed
[39:18] down to the idol
[39:21] we want believers god is looking for
[39:23] believers who will not bow
[39:24] who will not bend amen they will speak
[39:27] with a word
[39:29] hallelujah amen even if it is something
[39:32] small
[39:33] even if it is you know something which
[39:35] looks so small you will stand
[39:37] him and write to the values of god amen
[39:39] the word of god because
[39:41] that is what god wants you to live by we
[39:44] do not
[39:44] live by anything else we live by faith
[39:47] in the word of god
[39:48] we do not leave amen by the the the
[39:51] the favor of man we live by the word of
[39:55] god we do not even
[39:56] leave amen by other people helping us
[40:00] or by somebody doing something for me or
[40:03] because
[40:03] you know those kind of things we live by
[40:06] faith in the word
[40:07] a sincere child of god don't even live
[40:09] because of your job
[40:11] amen you go to work and you put in all
[40:14] your efforts but you don't even
[40:15] leave by your job or work you leave by
[40:19] faith in the word of god i'm living by
[40:21] faith in the word of god
[40:22] you must live by faith in the word of
[40:24] god faith will always take you through
[40:27] because we have sinned and had it in
[40:29] this day that a
[40:31] prophet has told us that faith in the
[40:33] word of god
[40:34] as long as you believe the word of god
[40:36] for the word of god amen
[40:38] we will be faithful at all times
[40:43] in any time the word of god will ever
[40:44] come in any season in any place
[40:47] it will overcome the word of god will
[40:50] take you through
[40:51] the word of god will guide you all your
[40:52] life
[40:54] hallelujah to this man will i look

[41:00] idols that he's going to cleanse us from
[41:03] i will cleanse you allow god to cleanse

[41:12] you to be
[41:14] a new heart also will i give you and we
[41:17] found out that's the first thing he will
[41:18] do
[41:19] and a new spirit will i put within you
[41:21] and i will take away the stony heart
[41:23] out of your flesh and i'll give you a
[41:26] heart of flesh
[41:28] praise the lord and i'll put my spirit
[41:30] within you
[41:31] and cause you to work in my statutes and
[41:33] ye shall be my shall keep my judgments
[41:36] and do them amen the only way
[41:40] you can be able to do the judgments of
[41:42] god and to keep
[41:44] his word is if you have his spirit in
[41:46] you and that's why he says i'll give you
[41:49] a new heart
[41:50] and i'll give you put within you and
[41:52] your spirit and
[41:53] eventually i'll give you my spirit
[41:57] and when you receive his spirit then you
[41:59] can be able to do his will
[42:01] we cannot be able to do his will in the
[42:03] nature that we have been
[42:04] having from birth we need to be
[42:07] reborn we need to be born again we need
[42:10] to receive a divine
[42:12] nature that is picked off in in the book
[42:14] of peter will not receive the divine
[42:16] nature the nature of christ
[42:20] what is the nature of christ the nature
[42:22] of christ
[42:24] is the opinion of christ about life
[42:28] is the idea of christ is the perspective
[42:31] of christ
[42:32] is the life of christ you don't look at
[42:36] things anymore the way others look at it
[42:38] you look at things in a different way
[42:40] with different eyes in a different
[42:42] fashion
[42:43] and others will say you are different
[42:44] and some of them may even say what is
[42:46] wrong with you because they can't
[42:48] understand
[42:49] what kind of life you are living my
[42:51] sister you will dress
[42:52] that dress because you you have the
[42:55] nature of christ
[42:57] you will throw away them trousers you
[42:59] will throw away
[43:00] at the miniskirts you would throw away
[43:02] those things of the world and make ups
[43:04] you will throw them all away
[43:05] and people can't understand why you do
[43:07] that but because you have received the
[43:09] divine nature the nature of christ my
[43:12] brother you leave
[43:13] them dance parties and their beer
[43:15] parties and them
[43:16] and the and the smoking and the
[43:18] drinkings and all those
[43:19] pleasures of the world why because even
[43:22] you have received that divine nature
[43:23] a nature which is not of the world the
[43:25] nature which is of christ and
[43:27] sometimes we think it's living only the
[43:28] bad things but also even leaving the
[43:31] evil communication because the bible
[43:32] says do not have evil communication
[43:34] through your mouth
[43:35] you find yourself sometimes when you are
[43:37] you you know you are together with the
[43:39] people with the believers what do you
[43:40] talk what
[43:41] the bible says think on these things
[43:44] what things is there praise on them
[43:46] is there you know is there a virtue on
[43:50] them
[43:50] you know think on these things things
[43:53] which will build your
[43:54] inner man amen we have to encourage one
[43:56] another whenever we meet
[43:57] you know why because the devil doesn't
[44:00] like it but you see
[44:01] we love it we love the nature of jesus
[44:04] christ
[44:05] praise the name of the lord let me read
[44:07] a little bit of a function of this
[44:09] of this uh uh
[44:13] of this quote and then uh
[44:17] we can we can we can finish up
[44:19] [Music]
[44:20] praise the name of the lord now i'm
[44:23] reading from the message why
[44:25] so many christians find it hard to live
[44:32] why is it that so many christians find
[44:35] it so
[44:36] hard to leave a christian life now that
[44:38] is uh
[44:42] 570303 for those who might want to look
[44:44] it up
[44:44] now he says
[44:50] well now we got all kinds of everything
[44:52] for coming and you haven't got it
[44:54] till you get it now he's talking about
[44:55] the holy spirit
[44:57] but brother you haven't got it until you
[44:59] until there is
[45:00] the spirit of god comes from heaven and
[45:02] changes your life
[45:03] so your life has to be changed and by
[45:05] the time your life gets changed then you
[45:07] can now tell that you have the holy
[45:08] spirit
[45:10] it's not a feeling it's not an emotion
[45:14] so i can feel it now i have it mm-hmm
[45:18] we found out that that will be the new
[45:19] spirit but not the holy spirit
[45:22] actually one of the mysteries that the
[45:24] prophet was able to open to us
[45:26] in this hour is the baptism of the holy
[45:29] ghost
[45:30] without sensation did you hear that the
[45:32] baptism of the holy ghost
[45:34] without sensation that's one of the
[45:36] mysteries that have been revealed in
[45:38] this day
[45:39] so what does it mean does it mean you
[45:41] receive the holy ghost like a baptist
[45:43] certainly not but it just rather means
[45:46] that the holy ghost
[45:47] is no longer ascribed uh to being
[45:50] shouting uh to being speaking in tongues
[45:53] to being any of these emotions or gifts
[45:56] but at the holocaust
[45:57] is rather the life of jesus by the
[46:00] nature of jesus christ living in you
[46:02] bringing forth that which was in christ
[46:06] whereby people will be able to see you
[46:07] and see the fruits
[46:09] amen emanating out of you human which is
[46:11] no longer
[46:12] that of you on making but that
[46:15] that christ has made through you
[46:19] it's like he said now you leave my word
[46:23] you will do my word and you will
[46:24] keep my judgments you see because it's
[46:26] another life in you
[46:28] i've got a life of g of christ in me
[46:31] i've got a life
[46:33] of christ in me i've got his nature
[46:36] i've got his ability i have the life
[46:39] of jesus christ in me it's no longer
[46:43] my emotions it's nothing to do with it
[46:46] follow here he says
[46:49] but brother you haven't got it until
[46:51] there is the spirit of
[46:52] of god comes from heaven and changes
[46:54] your life
[46:55] that makes the future of your life a
[46:57] different person did you hear that
[47:01] when he comes in oh my
[47:04] hallelujah everything about you changes
[47:08] you become a different a different
[47:11] person means
[47:12] your nature your character changes
[47:17] and then he says but they are fruit you
[47:18] shall know them that's the reason you
[47:20] have so much
[47:21] ups and downs you get a new spirit
[47:25] you know you get a new spirit you quit
[47:27] your drinking
[47:28] you get a new spirit you quit your
[47:30] you're lying you get a new spirit
[47:32] you can do most anything with that
[47:33] spirit did you hear a lot
[47:36] with that news now remember the new
[47:38] spirit is not the holy spirit
[47:40] the new spirit is your spirit that god
[47:43] gives you
[47:45] but it says under that face
[47:48] of your spiritual life you can do most
[47:51] of the things that a christian does
[47:54] you can quit your life you can quit your
[47:56] drinking you can actually
[47:58] speak times you can you can
[48:02] be lovely many things will happen you
[48:06] can shout you can dance you can
[48:08] yell you can laugh in the holy ghost why
[48:11] because you have a new spirit
[48:14] and it says under you get a new spirit
[48:16] you can do most of everything
[48:18] with that spirit but that isn't what god
[48:22] is talking about
[48:25] [Music]
[48:26] a new spirit he said i will give you
[48:29] now watch i'll give you a new heart and
[48:32] a new
[48:32] spirit why he would have given you he
[48:35] would have given you a new spirit
[48:37] he would have to give you a new spirit
[48:39] to live for him
[48:43] amen when he gives you a new spirit
[48:46] it enables you it gives you the ability
[48:49] even to live for him to yield yourself
[48:54] because with your own spirit in that old
[48:57] nature of yours
[48:58] you cannot be able to yield to him
[49:02] you are starchy cold you
[49:05] you are formal you you are in your own
[49:08] ways
[49:10] you have a stretchy spirit but it says
[49:13] but to this man when i remove
[49:15] he hallelujah that has a poor
[49:19] and a contrite spirit
[49:22] and the poor and accomplished spirit is
[49:25] the
[49:25] new spirit that god gives to you
[49:30] and it says why you couldn't even live
[49:32] with yourself
[49:33] with the spirit you did have
[49:36] oh many people with the old spirit the
[49:39] old nature that they had
[49:40] him and many of them even commit suicide
[49:44] can you imagine someone can hate
[49:46] themselves so much that they take their
[49:48] own lives
[49:50] so with the old spirit that you had it
[49:53] says you couldn't even live with
[49:56] yourself
[49:59] you couldn't even live with your
[50:00] neighbor
[50:02] you couldn't even associate with the
[50:03] next man in the next corner
[50:07] you couldn't even associate with these
[50:08] christians you can't
[50:10] because that old spirit of yours is
[50:13] selfishly
[50:14] bad why
[50:18] you would have an awful spirit you had
[50:21] it
[50:22] so he has to give you a new spirit my
[50:25] brother hallelujah
[50:29] amen he has to give you a new spirit
[50:32] i'll give you a new heart
[50:33] amen and a new spirit now watch and i'll
[50:36] put after
[50:37] all that then he says and i will put
[50:40] amen
[50:41] my spirit in you
[50:45] and he says there is the difference i
[50:48] will put my spirit in you
[50:51] and there is where you find it so hard
[50:53] that you go down to church and you get a
[50:55] different concept
[50:57] you know what i believe i ought to go to
[50:59] church
[51:00] then you go back home and say hallelujah
[51:02] i got it
[51:03] now you haven't then you go down to
[51:06] church and you say oh
[51:07] i believe that something just happened i
[51:09] believe something happened to me
[51:12] i don't look at things the way i used to
[51:13] do hallelujah and then in a few days you
[51:16] find yourself right down into the same
[51:17] old rat that you was
[51:20] he here you find that you got down into
[51:24] the
[51:24] same old rat that you was doubting
[51:28] reasoning everything else
[51:31] you see what did you get it wasn't the
[51:33] holy ghost it was the new spirit
[51:35] when you receive the new spirit it can
[51:37] get you get into all those kind of high
[51:39] ups and you feel like oh yeah
[51:40] i got it then you go back down in your
[51:44] old life you find that
[51:45] oh you're still being defeated it is
[51:47] hard to live a christian life
[51:49] these things are so boring it is so hard
[51:52] it's
[51:52] oh god i can't make it have mercy on me
[51:56] why because all you got was a new spirit
[51:58] and your spirit will help you
[52:00] to come close to god to have an
[52:02] association a relationship
[52:03] but you see within it it's there's no
[52:05] holding power
[52:07] there's no you know power of of con
[52:10] uh uh of sustaining sustainability in
[52:14] the christian world
[52:16] and he says well now if pastor if pastor
[52:18] so and so say that that wasn't right
[52:20] i don't believe it's right i'll just
[52:22] take his word for it
[52:23] and i and i tell you i'm going to do
[52:26] this and do that
[52:27] and you find yourself up and down in and
[52:29] out you just didn't go far enough
[52:32] so many christians find it so hard to
[52:34] live a christian life because they did
[52:36] not go
[52:36] far enough even they go as far as
[52:38] receiving a new spirit but they don't go
[52:40] as far as receiving the holy ghost
[52:42] and so you find that they sometimes this
[52:44] looks like they have it and sometimes it
[52:45] looks like they
[52:46] they are very far away sometimes it's
[52:48] easy for them to you know say amen to
[52:50] the world sometimes it's so hard
[52:51] sometimes they will take something
[52:52] because the pastor said it sometimes you
[52:54] know
[52:54] it's a struggle why because they have
[52:56] not yet received the holy ghost
[53:01] and you say brother panama i got all the
[53:03] evidences
[53:04] you know i can talk tongues i can shout
[53:06] i can you know dance to the holy ghost i
[53:08] can do that on this
[53:09] i can roll on the floor i'm a holy
[53:11] roller it means i have the holy ghost oh
[53:13] no no wait a moment
[53:15] he says i know but we are not talking
[53:17] about evidences
[53:20] we are talking about the product
[53:23] hallelujah
[53:25] that's right yes sir i've seen even
[53:28] shout
[53:28] i've seen them speak with tongues i've
[53:30] seen them lay down a pencil
[53:32] and write in the unknown tongues and on
[53:34] them and i wish raise
[53:36] up and read it and interpret and tell
[53:38] the truth
[53:40] if a man could speak with times if a man
[53:43] could shout
[53:44] if a man could see visions if a man
[53:46] could do any of those things
[53:48] that he can do without divine love they
[53:50] are lost
[53:53] divine love brother banana is trying to
[53:55] bring in here as the product because
[53:57] remember he says god
[53:58] is love and so if god is love then
[54:02] our product is to be like him is to have
[54:04] his nature his character
[54:07] that's right christ is the christ is in
[54:09] the heart he has to be
[54:10] in there so don't be deceived by signs
[54:12] and evidences
[54:14] they are all kinds of signs the bible
[54:17] said in the last days false prophets
[54:18] will rise up and show signs
[54:20] it will deceive the very elect if it
[54:23] were possible do you know why it would
[54:24] have
[54:25] almost received the very elect because
[54:27] the elect
[54:29] would only believe the world okay and
[54:31] these signs that these first prophets
[54:33] will show
[54:34] are part of the world so the elect will
[54:36] almost want to believe it because they
[54:38] see it in the world until we have even
[54:40] had some believers
[54:41] who say let me go to prophet saw and so
[54:43] even if it's a pentecostal but at least
[54:45] what he
[54:45] he does is in the bible it is what is in
[54:47] the bible he has a gift you see
[54:50] it would almost deceive the very elect
[54:52] and let me tell you never go there
[54:54] because you would be deceived
[54:57] and if you are the elect you shun them
[55:00] things and your
[55:00] source will be the message of the hour
[55:02] your source will be the word
[55:04] of god for this day hallelujah
[55:08] if you will deceive the vedic that if
[55:09] you are possible thank god is not
[55:11] possible
[55:12] come back to the bible science notice
[55:14] now i'll give you a new spirit and i
[55:16] will put my spirit
[55:17] now notice the new heart is put right in
[55:19] the middle of you
[55:21] and the new spirit is put right in the
[55:23] middle of your new heart
[55:25] and his spirit is put right in the
[55:27] middle of the new spirit
[55:29] his spirit is put right in the middle of
[55:31] your new spirit
[55:34] and it's just like the main spring in a
[55:37] famous watch
[55:39] the mainspring in a famous watch where
[55:42] all the other
[55:44] how do they call it they move around
[55:46] that mainspring
[55:49] when that main spring sets in the middle
[55:50] of the watch it controls every movement
[55:52] of that watch
[55:53] and that's what the matter friends now i
[55:56] hope you see this
[55:57] and i'm not saying it to try to twist or
[55:59] to be indifferent
[56:00] i'm only saying it because i know that
[56:02] some but someday
[56:03] i'll stand in the judgment with you you
[56:06] see if the holy spirit is in the middle
[56:08] of your spirit
[56:09] and that watch spring makes all the rest
[56:11] of the movements just stick
[56:13] just exactly to the place keeping
[56:15] perfect
[56:16] time when the holy spirit is in the
[56:18] middle of your spirit
[56:19] it makes every action of the holy spirit
[56:21] in you
[56:22] tick off just exactly according to god's
[56:25] time piece
[56:26] the bible so you don't lie
[56:29] you don't steal you you you got
[56:31] associates and you are and you are
[56:32] lovely
[56:33] and you've got peace joy and long
[56:34] suffering goodness weakness patience why
[56:37] oh the future of the spirit just sticks
[56:39] right with that main spring see what i
[56:41] mean
[56:42] oh my this is just so lovely hallelujah
[56:44] you see
[56:45] now i'm about to finish now it says now
[56:47] it's the main spring that does it it's
[56:49] the
[56:49] holy ghost that does it it's your church
[56:52] that does it it isn't just church that
[56:55] does it it
[56:56] isn't your pastor that does it it is not
[56:58] your shouting that does it
[57:00] it's not your speaking with tongues that
[57:02] doesn't it's not your healing service
[57:03] that does it it's the holy ghost
[57:05] that does it god is holy ghost in the
[57:08] middle of your new spirit
[57:10] it makes the whole church operate just
[57:12] exactly
[57:14] one big band of life
[57:18] hallelujah and he says friends

[57:25] the way

[57:28] ourselves every day

[57:35] is that he will give you that holy
[57:37] spirit he will give you that
[57:39] part of him he himself will give himself
