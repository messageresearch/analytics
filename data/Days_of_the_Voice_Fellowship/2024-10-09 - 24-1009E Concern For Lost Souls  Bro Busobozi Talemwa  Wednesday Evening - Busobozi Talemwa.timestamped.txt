[37:38] Ezekiel 3: 16 we'll begin from 16 and
[37:42] read up to vers
[37:45] 21 and I read in the name of the Lord
[37:48] Jesus and it came to pass at the end of
[37:52] seven days that the word of the Lord
[37:54] came unto me saying son of man I have
[37:57] made thee a Watchman unto the house of
[37:59] Israel therefore hear the word hear the
[38:02] word at my mouth and give them warning
[38:05] from me hear the word at my mouth and
[38:08] give them warning from me when I say
[38:11] unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die
[38:14] and thou givest him not warning nor
[38:21] speakest nor speaketh to warn the wicked
[38:24] from his Wicked way to save his life the
[38:28] same Wicked man shall die in his
[38:30] iniquity uh but his blood will I require
[38:33] at thine hand yet if thou warn the
[38:37] wicked and he turn not from his Wicked
[38:40] way wickedness nor from his we Wicked
[38:44] way he shall die in his iniquity but
[38:48] thou Hast delivered thy Soul again when
[38:51] a righteous man doth not doth turn from
[38:55] his righteousness and commit iniquity
[38:57] and I and I lay a stumbling block before
[39:00] him he shall die because thou Hast not
[39:03] given him warning he shall die in his
[39:06] sin and his righteousness which he has
[39:09] done shall not be remembered but his
[39:12] blood will I require at thine hand
[39:15] nevertheless if thou warn the righteous
[39:17] man that the righteous man the righteous
[39:20] sin not and he doeth not sin he shall
[39:24] surely live because he is warned all
[39:27] also thou Hast delivered thy
[39:32] Soul amen let us pray father Lord we uh
[39:36] commit these words that we have read
[39:37] today into your hands may you give us
[39:40] inspiration Lord and move over the
[39:43] congregation the people that are here
[39:45] and the people that are streaming this
[39:47] by the way of the internet Lord may you
[39:49] come and minister to each of us and by
[39:51] the end of the service may we indeed say
[39:53] that we have heard from the Lord and
[39:55] that he has convicted our hearts Lord in
[39:57] Jesus name we ask it amen you may have
[40:00] your
[40:05] seats nice to see uh you brother
[40:07] Emmanuel I'm happy to see you as well
[40:09] God bless you
[40:12] uh uh you remember the convention we had
[40:15] in eastern Uganda uh brother Emmanuel is
[40:17] the son of the pastor there and they
[40:19] doing a great work so we are so happy uh
[40:22] this evening to be in the house of the
[40:23] Lord and you know I believe there is
[40:26] something
[40:27] and and uh oh is that sister Ruth God
[40:30] bless you nice to see you thank you for
[40:33] you know making it tonight um it's you
[40:36] know I feel that God is doing something
[40:40] in our midst and we are really turning
[40:43] some sort of a corner in the in the
[40:45] fellowship here in the work of God that
[40:48] he has given to us here uh because these
[40:52] days whenever I go maybe praying or
[40:56] meditating
[40:57] he speaks to me very clearly about uh
[41:02] where we are supposed to go what we are
[41:04] supposed to do as a fellowship and uh
[41:06] that is
[41:08] why uh we have actually um we did not
[41:12] get a chance to announce it this Sunday
[41:13] because I was not around uh but we shall
[41:16] announce it properly on on on Sunday
[41:20] this coming Sunday we felt I felt
[41:23] inspired by the Lord the leadership of
[41:25] the Holy Spirit to
[41:27] um uh start uh what I called a home
[41:31] sales or Fellowship fellowships in
[41:34] different areas where Believers are
[41:36] coming from and um so we we started this
[41:42] this
[41:43] Monday um we've put fellowships almost
[41:47] in every area and the purpose is to get
[41:50] the message out the purpose is to do
[41:53] evangelism the purpose is to win souls
[41:55] for the Lord amen
[41:58] and we have uh different um and before I
[42:02] even continue I want to say something
[42:03] here
[42:07] um you know when you talk about a vision
[42:10] a vision is something that is usually
[42:12] very difficult to
[42:17] attain you know something that you can
[42:19] actually say and some people will laugh
[42:21] at you and because it looks impossible
[42:23] or difficult
[42:28] so I remember we were just
[42:30] about um 30
[42:33] people and I announced to you that we
[42:35] needed to collect money for the church
[42:41] land right at the beginning you know God
[42:43] showed us where we would go how the
[42:46] fellowship would
[42:50] go it doesn't mean it would be
[42:54] easy if God has given the vision it is
[42:56] got to accomplish
[43:00] it so we started um you know
[43:03] contributing you know monthly on a
[43:05] monthly
[43:08] basis and um we pledged quite a good sum
[43:12] of of money about within
[43:15] about I think two
[43:21] years um and about 30 Millions
[43:26] also from just about 30
[43:29] people or even less those who were
[43:31] pledging and
[43:35] giving and it looked very
[43:39] difficult and almost impossible that we
[43:42] will attain our
[43:45] goal and so well we increased and filled
[43:49] the place and so we needed a
[43:54] tent and then we filled that place so we
[43:56] needed
[44:01] place and by God's grace we came
[44:05] here now uh coming here made us lose
[44:08] some amount of
[44:12] money I think about 10 million or
[44:16] so and so it it was a big
[44:23] discouragement and so it discouraged
[44:26] many to give those who
[44:29] giving they gave up they stopped
[44:32] giving so I would go in my little study
[44:35] and I begin praying and meditating oh
[44:37] God what next what
[44:40] [Music]
[44:43] next brothers and sisters there is
[44:47] something about being led by God
[45:04] when by
[45:08] God there you will know that whatever
[45:11] God tells you must come to pass but when
[45:14] you are led by
[45:17] somebody you will not be sure whether
[45:19] the thing will whether come to pass
[45:23] on that person may forsake you or may
[45:26] let
[45:28] but God will never
[45:30] do if God has promised something we'll
[45:33] fulfill
[45:34] it so God led
[45:38] me that's why in
[45:41] Mage we have no
[45:43] headquarter where the one the one in
[45:46] command is the one who gives all in the
[45:49] message all of us we
[45:53] see and all of us we hear from our Arch
[45:56] Bishop
[45:59] fellow every Fellowship is that Pastor
[46:02] to listen from the Holy Spirit and so um
[46:05] and so God will lead me you know got
[46:08] another
[46:11] idea of get dividing us into several
[46:16] groups and um the target was that each
[46:19] group would at least raise
[46:25] 250,000 and um we divided the church
[46:28] into seven
[46:32] groups I talked to one person he said
[46:34] that is not
[46:39] sustainable people will give
[46:41] up people canot sustain that
[46:45] pressure I also was seeing
[46:48] it but one thing that gave me
[46:51] strength was it was the leadership of
[46:53] the Holy
[46:55] Spirit I have so confidence in the Holy
[47:00] Spirit even when others
[47:03] fail the Holy Spirit Can't
[47:05] Fail when I fail when you fail the Holy
[47:10] Spirit cannot
[47:12] fail so we divided the church into seven
[47:17] groups and within 30 I think last Sunday
[47:21] was how many weeks 35 weeks yes that is
[47:24] 35 weeks ago weeks
[47:28] and we by God's grace have been able to
[47:31] raise um a total sum of 30 uh I'm
[47:35] looking at a brother to tell me he not
[47:37] here how
[47:39] much in the past 36 weeks 35
[47:44] weeks 36 Millions yes 36
[47:49] millions and so and for a total sum
[47:52] right now we have 62 million
[47:57] now that looked like a
[47:59] dream but we are closing in on our
[48:04] Target we only need 210 million or 200
[48:09] Millions God is able to do
[48:12] that hallelujah amen we are going to
[48:15] attain
[48:16] it because it was it was a leadership
[48:19] from the Holy
[48:21] Spirit those without jobs God is going
[48:23] to continue giving them
[48:25] jobs know
[48:27] and those with with less income God will
[48:30] increase the
[48:33] income and even God is able to do it in
[48:36] the way we never
[48:39] expected you know God can give us land
[48:41] that is
[48:43] cheap he's the owner of this
[48:46] world you know God can you know raise
[48:48] someone Among Us and you know donate a
[48:50] big sum
[48:54] of or maybe someone following the
[48:56] service on
[48:59] whichever way but I know he will do
[49:01] it and know the way brother would say it
[49:05] if he's coming back next year if we know
[49:07] he's coming back next
[49:08] year let him find us doing something for
[49:11] the
[49:13] Lord it won't hurt
[49:15] anything praise the name of the Lord
[49:17] amen and so I had this leadership
[49:21] then to also set this home sales home to
[49:25] be able to do evangelism around the city
[49:28] and around where Believers come
[49:32] from because as you can
[49:35] see is mid
[49:41] services or less
[49:45] comes of different
[49:47] reasons one of them being
[49:52] transport and so um it was a burden to
[49:56] me how can I do it how can we do
[50:00] it until this idea just came to me you
[50:04] know um we can divide the fellowship in
[50:08] different uh segments or
[50:16] areas and start fellowships
[50:20] there we have many brothers Among
[50:24] Us who can preach and can
[50:28] witness they may not necessarily be
[50:30] accomplished preachers but at least they
[50:31] can
[50:35] witness and that's all we need to do and
[50:37] encourage the
[50:40] Breen let's say it may be difficult for
[50:43] you to bring someone here to
[50:45] church but it is easy for you to bring
[50:48] to call someone to your
[50:50] home or take them to a home of another
[50:53] believer
[50:57] that is the
[50:58] purpose and so we've I I will announce
[51:01] those home sales all of them on on
[51:05] Sunday but it has already
[51:08] started I was invited right away when
[51:11] sister PE heard of
[51:13] that she's um one of the students that
[51:16] are at
[51:18] ucu so she told me Pastor you are you
[51:21] are
[51:22] here every Monday
[51:26] this
[51:27] Monday we went there by God's
[51:30] grace and they they you know they
[51:32] collected them they gathered
[51:34] themselves I think we have um two
[51:37] Believers from this Fellowship there two
[51:39] or
[51:41] three and then
[51:44] one and then two from um uh another
[51:50] church that we have so far known that
[51:53] the university has I was told more than
[51:57] 10,000
[52:00] students talking about a very huge
[52:06] congregation if they will not come to
[52:08] church we will take the message to where
[52:09] they
[52:12] areion we now have we will take the
[52:14] messenger if on the streets we shall
[52:17] take
[52:17] it on radio we are taking it wherever in
[52:22] their homes we will go we are going to
[52:25] print tracks we will send
[52:29] and so they also invited their
[52:32] friends so they were about 10 students
[52:38] there and I preached on God's provided
[52:41] way for the end
[52:44] time and one person asked about what a
[52:49] baptism they explained it to them and
[52:52] they promise they will come back
[52:54] again we believe it's going to be a
[52:58] amen not only there but in every place
[53:02] where
[53:03] Believers we should be under
[53:07] expectation we should be on fire
[53:09] for we don't have much time what we have
[53:13] received is
[53:15] gold it's not just for us to receive and
[53:18] sleep is for us to receive and be on
[53:22] fire to spread it to somebody
[53:25] else praise the name of the Lord amen
[53:28] and so we have read
[53:31] today from
[53:33] eel and I'm speaking to you on concern
[53:36] for lost
[53:41] souls and he said if when you see a
[53:44] wicked
[53:47] man and um and he says
[53:52] you okay I'll begin up there he says um
[53:55] I have made you a Watchman unto the
[53:57] house of
[54:03] Israel um you know a Watchman is someone
[54:06] who watches for
[54:13] danger he sees danger
[54:16] coming and he warns the rest of the
[54:18] people hey danger is
[54:21] coming danger is coming watch
[54:25] out so now he says he has made us he has
[54:28] made you a
[54:32] Watchman every believer is a
[54:35] Watchman we are a watch I am a
[54:39] Watchman he says I have made your
[54:42] Watchman unto the house of
[54:46] Israel therefore hear the word at my at
[54:49] my
[54:51] mouth and give them give the people give
[54:54] them warning from me
[54:58] when I say unto the wicked you will
[55:02] die and you don't give them the
[55:05] warning no speakest to warn the wicked
[55:09] from his Wicked
[55:13] way to save his
[55:16] life the same Wicked man shall die in
[55:19] his
[55:22] iniquity but his
[55:24] blood will I require at your
[55:28] hand
[55:29] imagine that you may be
[55:33] guilty you may be
[55:35] condemned not because you did not
[55:38] believe but because you believed and
[55:42] ignored or you did not have the concern
[55:44] for the lost
[55:48] souls may God help us to have concern
[55:51] for the lost
[55:53] soul but you see instead of Believers
[55:55] having concern for the lost
[55:59] soul you find them actually also
[56:02] conniving with the lost souls to
[56:09] sin do you know do you know the worst
[56:12] thing that God
[56:14] hats what God hats most
[56:18] more is a Believer who knows the
[56:22] truth but becomes a stumbling block to
[56:24] those who do not know
[56:28] the Bible says such a person is a person
[56:32] who has seen the
[56:34] light and then he goes into the
[56:37] darkness and he does those works of
[56:39] darkness that God redeemed him out
[56:43] of he says he will even be he's even
[56:47] worse in other words he says is taking
[56:50] back Christ on the
[56:54] cross and he said there is no no more
[56:57] blood or shed for
[57:01] them no more
[57:03] sacrifice you see how serious it
[57:06] is when you know the truth when you have
[57:10] received the truth you must not only
[57:13] keep it under
[57:14] your if indeed it is true you have
[57:17] received the
[57:19] truth you are going to be on
[57:21] fire you want your neighbor to know the
[57:23] truth your
[57:26] you want to go with someone to church to
[57:28] hear this
[57:30] message you want to not only hear the
[57:33] message but you want someone else to
[57:34] hear
[57:36] it you are convinced about this
[57:39] message therefore you are concerned
[57:41] about
[57:42] it you may not be a preacher but you
[57:44] will do something to redeem that
[57:49] person and in a message convinced and
[57:52] and then concerned
[57:56] says I don't want anyone to be
[58:00] lost amen amen I am concerned about
[58:05] you I am concerned about the
[58:08] people because I'm convinced that Jesus
[58:11] is
[58:14] Christ how many are convinced this
[58:16] message is the
[58:18] truth if you convinced this message is
[58:21] the
[58:22] truth you are going to be
[58:25] concerned about telling someone about
[58:28] it you're going to be
[58:30] concerned about telling someone God has
[58:33] sent a
[58:35] prophet you are going to be
[58:38] concerned oh my I want you to follow me
[58:41] here he says I'm convinced that we are
[58:43] living in the last
[58:46] days some people know we are living in
[58:49] the last
[58:51] days but they are not convinced about
[58:55] it I wonder how many are convinced we
[58:57] are living
[58:59] in that's the reason I well on the field
[59:03] I saided many years ago he says I could
[59:07] have been two times a million I said I
[59:09] could have been two times a
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:17] multi-millionaire but but it says why he
[59:19] says you know they were giving him money
[59:21] and you know what but he says why didn't
[59:23] I why didn't you take it
[59:28] your pastor here knows that how many
[59:30] times thousands times thousands of
[59:33] dollars we turned
[59:40] down brother by the way had an
[59:45] opportunity of being one of the richest
[59:49] preachers one of the
[59:51] richest forget about the ones you
[59:53] reading
[59:55] about brother bam had a
[59:57] gift that would have made him a
[1:00:02] multimillionaire you see these people
[1:00:04] these days they just have a little gift
[1:00:07] of
[1:00:09] designment which even has a margin of
[1:00:13] error but see how many people they
[1:00:16] have and see how much money they have
[1:00:18] made
[1:00:20] for but many times brother Bram refused
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:24] man he turned down the
[1:00:27] why because he said I know we are living
[1:00:29] in the last
[1:00:31] days I'm convinced we are at the end
[1:00:35] time and I'm concerned about the
[1:00:38] condition of the church here at the
[1:00:42] end here at the
[1:00:45] end how many are concerned about what is
[1:00:47] going on in the
[1:00:49] world I wonder if this message is not
[1:00:52] becoming so common to us
[1:00:56] may this message never become so common
[1:00:58] to
[1:01:00] us amen amen you know I want you to see
[1:01:04] here in the book of Isaiah chapter
[1:01:08] 6 ver
[1:01:10] 5 it says then said I why is me uh you
[1:01:15] can read it out of Isaiah 658 if you can
[1:01:19] it says then said I W me for I am undone
[1:01:23] because I am a man of unclean lips and
[1:01:25] and I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:01:29] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:01:32] king the Lord of hor then flew one of
[1:01:36] the seraphim unto me having a live call
[1:01:39] in his hand which he had taken with the
[1:01:42] tongues of the Altar and he laid it upon
[1:01:45] my mouth and said
[1:01:47] Lo this has touched thy lips and thine
[1:01:50] iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[1:01:53] purged
[1:01:58] also can vers verse 8 also I heard the
[1:02:01] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[1:02:03] send and who will go for us then said I
[1:02:07] here am I send me friends I want you to
[1:02:09] follow me closely
[1:02:10] here we see this man
[1:02:13] Isaiah well of course it says that in
[1:02:15] the in the in the year that died he saw
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:21] Lord but you see he found himself to be
[1:02:23] unclean
[1:02:26] many reasons people when they receive
[1:02:27] this message they feel they unlean to
[1:02:29] preach
[1:02:31] it because this is a holy
[1:02:34] message praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:02:37] are you following me I don't want you to
[1:02:40] be distracted because I know you are
[1:02:41] used to brother interpreting but Brother
[1:02:43] Martin also can actually interpret and
[1:02:45] so I want you to uh don't not be
[1:02:48] distracted I want you to follow me
[1:02:49] closely praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:02:52] because I understand some when you're
[1:02:54] used to someone when you're used to your
[1:02:55] pastor are preaching in a certain way
[1:02:56] and another preacher comes on the pulpit
[1:02:58] you get concerned on how the words are
[1:03:00] coming more than what is coming
[1:03:11] out so I want you to hear the
[1:03:13] words not the way it is brought
[1:03:17] out and pray for The Interpreter and for
[1:03:20] myself as well now I want you to follow
[1:03:22] closely here because something that I
[1:03:23] have really on my heart to share with
[1:03:25] you this evening
[1:03:27] he says why is me I am undone because I
[1:03:30] am a man of unclean
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:35] lips and I dwell in the midst of unclean
[1:03:39] people people who have unclean
[1:03:43] lips but you see this man could not go
[1:03:46] and
[1:03:48] tell he could not go and
[1:03:51] testify he would not go and
[1:03:54] witness because of the kind of life he
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:58] had you see because he knew the way he
[1:04:04] was he
[1:04:06] admitted he
[1:04:08] accepted that he needed a
[1:04:11] change that he need an encounter with
[1:04:14] God by the way let me tell you that's
[1:04:16] one of the things why people don't have
[1:04:18] an encounter with
[1:04:22] God they don't
[1:04:24] accept they don't accept you don't admit
[1:04:27] your
[1:04:28] wrongdoing you you don't accept you need
[1:04:31] a
[1:04:33] savior you don't accept you are
[1:04:35] bad you are pretending you are
[1:04:38] good even when you know you are
[1:04:41] bad and because of that God doesn't
[1:04:45] visit
[1:04:46] you but brother sister the moment you
[1:04:48] get to
[1:04:50] understand I am bad I need a savior I am
[1:04:56] struggling I need a
[1:04:58] change when you are concerned about
[1:05:01] yourself and youed about the
[1:05:05] word God will visit you and when God
[1:05:09] visits you he will change you and when
[1:05:12] it changes you then he will give you a
[1:05:16] burden and a
[1:05:18] concern the lost souls out
[1:05:21] there amen because you will have a
[1:05:24] desire
[1:05:25] for God to visit
[1:05:28] someone the way God visited
[1:05:31] you hallelujah amen I remember when I
[1:05:34] was 15
[1:05:36] years when when God visited me and I
[1:05:41] believe this
[1:05:42] message I received a
[1:05:44] burden because I was
[1:05:47] shocked I was
[1:05:50] shocked you know
[1:05:52] like the way God visited me
[1:05:56] the way God changed
[1:05:58] me don't know what I'm talking I was
[1:06:01] very
[1:06:03] hard I was very
[1:06:06] difficult you know someone who's
[1:06:08] difficult Hard
[1:06:10] Hearted I believed in my
[1:06:14] church in the doctr of the Anglican
[1:06:18] Church I even wanted to be a
[1:06:21] bishop because that's something I had
[1:06:23] grown under I had grown under the bishop
[1:06:25] and I seen how God is using him and I
[1:06:27] thought this is the closest you can
[1:06:35] be and so when I would see him with that
[1:06:39] ring and the cross on
[1:06:42] him and you know he would raise up his
[1:06:45] hand and bless
[1:06:48] everyone in my heart I also wanted to
[1:06:50] bless
[1:06:52] everyone I felt that is serving God
[1:06:56] I felt that is being close to
[1:06:59] God but when God visited me and he spoke
[1:07:03] to me I received a burden in my
[1:07:07] heart amen and I believed this message
[1:07:11] and I was baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ from that day I received a new
[1:07:19] concern in
[1:07:21] my a con for Souls
[1:07:25] conc for L
[1:07:27] Soul like I was no I I never stood I've
[1:07:32] never in all my
[1:07:33] life stood up to preach I've never done
[1:07:36] it because I was promised
[1:07:41] money I've never preached for a meal
[1:07:46] ticket I've never preached because I was
[1:07:48] going to get something out of
[1:07:51] it let me tell you even if you all
[1:07:53] stopped paying your ties
[1:07:57] I will
[1:07:58] preach why am I saying that I don't care
[1:08:02] whether I am a pastor or an apostle
[1:08:05] teacher
[1:08:08] or all I care
[1:08:10] about is the burden God has put on my
[1:08:14] heart is the concern for the Lost
[1:08:18] Souls not because I'm a
[1:08:21] preacher because I'm a Believer

[1:25:49] liberated we have been set
[1:25:52] free by the power of the message

[1:25:57] reason to go out and tell

[1:28:21] Christ amen but inia we are so busy the
[1:28:24] building our
[1:28:27] organizations we are so busy fasting
[1:28:29] about who is the greatest Among
[1:28:34] Us you have even had some people in the
[1:28:38] message saying our pastor is the best
[1:28:41] pastor and preacher in the
[1:28:45] world that doesn't
[1:28:48] matter you know we are busy finding out
[1:28:51] who has more people in his church
[1:28:57] who preaches
[1:28:58] better and we have neglected the message
[1:29:02] of our
[1:29:04] day it is a
[1:29:07] disgrace we are so busy educating
[1:29:12] ourselves going to schools and schools
[1:29:15] and
[1:29:16] schools and yet Our Generation has
[1:29:18] produced the generation of fools
[1:29:26] people who have done so foolish things
[1:29:28] that even when you check the generations
[1:29:30] before us they couldn't
[1:29:38] do so we becoming more educated or are
[1:29:40] becoming more
[1:29:44] foolish in a country where you tell me
[1:29:47] that these are people who are
[1:29:53] educated you cannot ask a question who
[1:29:55] is a
[1:29:58] woman the moment you ask a question who
[1:30:00] is a
[1:30:01] woman you will be called all sorts of
[1:30:04] things you a bigot you are this you
[1:30:07] that simply because you ask somebody who
[1:30:10] is a woman or are you a woman or are you
[1:30:11] a
[1:30:15] man is that education of
[1:30:20] foolishness and they're bringing it in
[1:30:22] our curriculums
[1:30:25] it's not only in
[1:30:27] America Europe it's coming to Africa
[1:30:31] it's taking over the
[1:30:33] world time will
[1:30:35] come when believer
[1:30:44] teachers many Believers in
[1:30:47] America started their own
[1:30:49] schools or they homeschool their
[1:30:52] children because filth is so
[1:30:57] great instead of becoming wise they
[1:31:00] became fools
[1:31:02] the you read your Bible it says they
[1:31:05] profess to be
[1:31:08] wise but they became
[1:31:11] fools we are so committed to making
[1:31:16] money and yet we give less
[1:31:22] money than the is before
[1:31:25] us we no longer have time to go to
[1:31:29] church we are too
[1:31:32] occupied with Big
[1:31:35] Dreams Big Dreams that can never be
[1:31:39] achieved yet
[1:31:41] heaven heaven is the only realistic
[1:31:48] dream those who have trusted in Jesus
[1:31:54] never been
[1:31:57] confounded am let me tell you friends
[1:32:01] you may call me all sorts of things by
[1:32:03] saying these
[1:32:06] words but that's the
[1:32:08] truth that's what is
[1:32:11] f and we need young
[1:32:14] men we need young
[1:32:17] ladies mothers fathers married people
[1:32:20] and single
[1:32:22] people who will have
[1:32:25] Vision according to the program of
[1:32:29] God I don't care about your
[1:32:31] program God has a
[1:32:34] program and God's program is the
[1:32:38] word praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:32:41] see brother Message thean Church
[1:32:44] age he says they were not burden for
[1:32:48] Souls but they were burdened with wealth
[1:32:52] with we wealth wealth
[1:32:57] that's right they have the wrong
[1:33:01] burden they had a burden for their
[1:33:03] wealth but not a burden for lost
[1:33:09] souls the scripture say they didn't know
[1:33:12] that they were
[1:33:18] wretched miserable and
[1:33:21] blind they think that they could take
[1:33:23] money and convert the
[1:33:27] world or if we could just get a program
[1:33:30] on and we could get a lot of money
[1:33:36] here I believe we can we could convert
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:40] world some people actually even know
[1:33:42] some brothers who cannot do anything for
[1:33:44] God because they have no
[1:33:49] money we need 37 million shillings to
[1:33:53] prepare the upcoming youth
[1:33:59] meetings as I speak we have
[1:34:03] zero and we need it in two
[1:34:08] months how possibly could we have raised
[1:34:13] that a church of only barely 100
[1:34:17] people 37 million
[1:34:20] shs you could say impossible let us dump
[1:34:22] the dream
[1:34:26] but listen friends it's not money that
[1:34:29] serves
[1:34:31] God it's not money that converts the
[1:34:35] world it is a
[1:34:38] burden it is a
[1:34:41] concern oh if you could just get a
[1:34:44] program
[1:34:46] on that we could get a lot of money
[1:34:50] here oh someone says if some of the rich
[1:34:52] people in our church
[1:34:58] if you could just get them to dig
[1:35:03] out and I believe that we could start a
[1:35:08] society that that would go
[1:35:11] around and convert the
[1:35:14] world we could take
[1:35:17] airplanes and drop literature all over
[1:35:19] Africa
[1:35:23] things like
[1:35:25] that if we just had some
[1:35:28] money
[1:35:30] brother the world won't be converted by
[1:35:36] money someone is not hearing this the
[1:35:40] world will not be converted by
[1:35:44] money the world will be converted by the
[1:35:46] Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost hallelujah amen by what by the

[1:36:37] the disciples like
[1:36:39] that they never talked about them as if
[1:36:41] they were preaching like men who didn't
[1:36:43] know what they were talking

[1:39:37] does to a man or a
[1:39:41] woman when it strikes their
[1:39:44] heart when it strikes your
[1:39:47] heart and it takes a
[1:39:50] board there is a thir
[1:39:54] there is a
[1:39:55] thirst and a
[1:39:57] hunger for L
[1:40:01] Soul that's what the matter with the
[1:40:03] meetings
[1:40:06] today there is not enough Spirit touch
[1:40:09] in
[1:40:13] it to go for L For The Souls of the Lost
[1:40:16] and the
[1:40:18] dying it is more to make a name
[1:40:25] to make a
[1:40:26] church
[1:40:28] aaut
[1:40:31] aomination instead of a soul winning
[1:40:37] program and brother bam says how
[1:40:41] pitiful praise the name of the
[1:40:44] Lord praise the name of the
[1:40:46] Lord and when you receive the Holy
[1:40:49] Ghost you can't

[1:40:56] somebody you have a concern for the lost
[1:40:59] soul Romans 10 says whoever shall call
[1:41:01] upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:41:05] saved but how then shall they call on
[1:41:07] him in whom they have not
[1:41:10] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:41:12] him whom of whom they have not
[1:41:16] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:41:20] preacher and how shall they preach
[1:41:24] except they be
[1:41:26] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[1:41:29] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:41:30] of
[1:41:34] peace when he says except they be
[1:41:39] sent the denomination that sends
[1:41:44] you it is God that sends
[1:41:47] you when you meet that Pillar of
[1:41:50] Fire it doesn't matter who you are
[1:41:52] sister or
[1:41:54] brother in the message the lamb and the
[1:41:57] dove he says no matter how much you
[1:42:01] preach you got a real ill
[1:42:05] temper don't it doesn't do you so much
[1:42:09] good to
[1:42:14] preach doesn't do you much good to
[1:42:17] preach no matter how much you join
[1:42:19] church and try to
[1:42:22] impersonate you are crabbing and nasty
[1:42:24] with your
[1:42:28] neighbor you will never win him to
[1:42:31] Christ
[1:42:32] then it is the fruit of the
[1:42:37] spirit as my wife used to tell me
[1:42:40] actions speak louder than
[1:42:44] words that's right leave me a
[1:42:48] someon instead of preaching me
[1:42:53] good thing leave me a
[1:42:56] sermon all of us can be
[1:42:59] preachers through a lived
[1:43:02] someone our life s don't have to go and
[1:43:05] take a microphone
[1:43:08] and you can live through your
[1:43:11] life the way you live the way you dress
[1:43:15] the way you deal with your
[1:43:18] neighbors you see some neighbors are
[1:43:21] very naughty
[1:43:25] wildly you know and then they see they
[1:43:27] can relate with you the way they relate
[1:43:29] with other
[1:43:34] women then you
[1:43:36] also you also let that
[1:43:39] happen you've just failed to preach
[1:43:42] someone you have an opportunity
[1:43:45] sisters to preach to your

[1:44:06] Vibes but that of the holy spirit let
[1:44:09] them test and see that the Lord is good
[1:44:12] in your
[1:44:14] life that you a different kind of
[1:44:18] woman that there will be so much pulled

[1:45:16] person and The Story
[1:45:18] Goes that he
[1:45:21] died or went into trans and he said he
[1:45:24] went up to
[1:45:27] heaven of course when he
[1:45:29] died and when he got to the
[1:45:38] Pates the caretaker come to the

[1:47:05] Gates when he said I want to come in
[1:47:08] this
