[1:05:44] you Hallelujah God is so good if you
[1:05:49] allow me I would like you to stand
[1:05:52] up and we read from the scripture
[1:06:10] verse The Gospel of John chapter
[1:06:17] 1se we read it in the name of
[1:06:20] Jesus and this is the record of
[1:06:23] John when the Jewish Saint priest
[1:06:25] Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who
[1:06:28] are thou and he confessed and deny not
[1:06:32] but confessed I am not Christ and they
[1:06:35] asked him what then are you Elijah and
[1:06:39] he said I am not are you thy prophet and
[1:06:42] he answered no then they said unto him
[1:06:46] who art thou that we may give an answer
[1:06:49] to them that sent us what sayest thou of
[1:06:53] thyself and he said
[1:06:56] I am the voice of the one crying in the
[1:06:58] wildness making straight the way of the
[1:07:01] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah
[1:07:24] amen for
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:58] Heavenly Father we thank
[1:08:00] you we bless your name we have here to
[1:08:04] hear from
[1:08:06] you may you use me as a vis may you
[1:08:09] speak to the
[1:08:11] people you reveal the word to
[1:08:13] them take me aside and speak yourself in
[1:08:18] the name of Jesus Amen you may be
[1:08:22] seated hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:26] today I fa to speak on
[1:08:32] identification and age we live
[1:08:36] in some of them they don't know their
[1:08:44] identification we have boys saying we
[1:08:46] are
[1:08:48] girls we have girls that's saying we are
[1:08:53] men they don't know
[1:08:56] either they are woman or
[1:08:58] men so you know the age we living
[1:09:02] in has sto some of people's
[1:09:08] identity and it's a very important
[1:09:13] time that we need to have an
[1:09:17] identification even in this world where
[1:09:20] we
[1:09:21] living someone who doesn't have an
[1:09:24] identification
[1:09:27] ID he will not be known where he's
[1:09:30] coming
[1:09:32] from he will not know no one will know
[1:09:35] where this come this person is coming
[1:09:38] from in some countries it's illegal to
[1:09:41] be found someone with no
[1:09:45] identification so it is very
[1:09:49] important to have an
[1:09:53] identification identification
[1:09:57] that you have come from
[1:09:59] somewhere and if we know we have come
[1:10:02] from
[1:10:03] somewhere we know where we are
[1:10:05] going and the prophet say if we came
[1:10:09] from
[1:10:10] there we go back there but if you are
[1:10:14] not called from there we will not go
[1:10:16] back there so it's very important have
[1:10:19] an
[1:10:21] identification Hallelujah so that is the
[1:10:24] question John is being
[1:10:28] asked they come and they ask him and
[1:10:31] these people are not just normal people
[1:10:33] from the
[1:10:36] road these are
[1:10:38] teachers these are religious
[1:10:40] people so they don't use any kind of
[1:10:44] words they bring the scripture to
[1:10:47] him and they ask him are you
[1:10:50] Elijah because in the Bible in the Mali
[1:10:55] the Malachi spoke of
[1:10:57] Elijah God will send
[1:11:00] El so because they know the scripture
[1:11:03] very
[1:11:03] well they asked him are you
[1:11:07] this so he said
[1:11:10] no okay okay if this guy is saying
[1:11:14] no also Moses
[1:11:17] quoted God will rais a prophet like unto
[1:11:22] me so they asked him are you that
[1:11:24] prophet
[1:11:26] and then he said
[1:11:28] no so these people were
[1:11:31] confused because the way John is uh the
[1:11:35] character of
[1:11:37] John is telling them he came from
[1:11:39] somewhere in the
[1:11:42] scripture and because they know the
[1:11:45] scripture now they are confused to find
[1:11:48] where should we find you in the
[1:11:52] scripture the real question they want to
[1:11:54] ask you
[1:11:56] is where should we find you in the
[1:12:00] scripture
[1:12:02] Hallelujah so John gave them time to
[1:12:08] discuss after they dig out the
[1:12:12] scripture they couldn't find who John
[1:12:15] was so John replied to
[1:12:19] them and John didn't
[1:12:21] say I am the father of um
[1:12:27] somewhere my mother is
[1:12:29] Elizabeth I came from the
[1:12:31] jungle I eat honey I live a normal
[1:12:36] life yes he's a man from The
[1:12:39] Jungle yes he lives in the desert but he
[1:12:43] didn't use those
[1:12:44] things to identify
[1:12:48] himself Hallelujah am so I'm here to
[1:12:51] tell you today whatever you're going
[1:12:53] through
[1:12:55] will not identify
[1:12:57] you your identification is the
[1:13:00] scripture your identification is the
[1:13:02] word of
[1:13:03] God hallelujah no one can give you an
[1:13:08] identification the government cannot
[1:13:10] give you
[1:13:11] identification your mother cannot give
[1:13:13] you
[1:13:14] identification your identification is
[1:13:16] from the word of
[1:13:18] God came from God you go back to God
[1:13:23] hallelujah amen that's why you are
[1:13:25] special
[1:13:26] people you have a special
[1:13:29] identification you don't refer the word
[1:13:31] to identificate
[1:13:34] you you don't use education to identify
[1:13:39] you you don't allow situation to
[1:13:41] identify
[1:13:43] you you allow the word of God to
[1:13:45] identify
[1:13:46] you Hallelujah you are not what people
[1:13:50] say you
[1:13:50] are you are not what the church says you
[1:13:53] are you are what word
[1:13:56] say hallelujah so I'm here to tell you
[1:14:01] sit back
[1:14:03] relax and hear the word of
[1:14:05] God
[1:14:07] hallelujah God bless you Hallelujah so
[1:14:12] John didn't say I came from my mother
[1:14:18] Elize but he came from his
[1:14:21] mother and his father was a
[1:14:24] minister his M his father was a man who
[1:14:27] had a word from the
[1:14:30] angel his father was a religious
[1:14:33] person he didn't tell these
[1:14:36] people I came from
[1:14:40] zakar I came from the
[1:14:42] bishop I came from this church my father
[1:14:46] has big
[1:14:47] church he didn't allow those things to
[1:14:49] identify
[1:14:51] him
[1:14:52] Hallelujah I will tell you something
[1:14:54] today
[1:14:56] your
[1:14:58] identification is the word of
[1:15:00] God
[1:15:03] hallelujah and these people to ask this
[1:15:07] this different
[1:15:09] question they use the scripture to
[1:15:13] come they use the scripture to come to
[1:15:17] John and they ask him who are
[1:15:21] you what's where where should we find
[1:15:24] you
[1:15:27] they use the same
[1:15:29] scripture they use the same Bible that
[1:15:33] John is
[1:15:34] using they use the same Bible that John
[1:15:38] is
[1:15:39] reading they have read Isaiah many times
[1:15:42] and John
[1:15:45] has they know Isaiah before John was
[1:15:49] born people know the scripture better
[1:15:52] than
[1:15:55] but when John was reading the
[1:15:58] scripture and when he opened the book of
[1:16:02] Isaiah and he read the
[1:16:04] book that spoke about
[1:16:07] him that book was a different book for
[1:16:11] him yes he used the same
[1:16:14] Bible but when he read it for
[1:16:17] himself that scripture he seem very well
[1:16:20] he say this scripture is
[1:16:22] familiar this is not something new
[1:16:26] Hallelujah that's why in the
[1:16:28] message we don't make
[1:16:31] people become a message
[1:16:35] Believers we don't make them
[1:16:38] seed we don't have the power to make
[1:16:40] them the
[1:16:41] seed because it is
[1:16:44] God who give them that
[1:16:46] seed allow them to hear the word of
[1:16:50] God so for us our job is to open the
[1:16:55] reveal
[1:16:56] word and them if they respond they are
[1:17:00] the seed of God if they don't respond we
[1:17:03] don't judge Hallelujah so we don't make
[1:17:07] message
[1:17:09] Believers but we preach to the
[1:17:12] message and they will receive the word
[1:17:14] of God
[1:17:18] hallelujah
[1:17:20] so when John was reading that
[1:17:23] book when he read the book of
[1:17:26] Isaiah it was something different about
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:31] book it was not speaking to another
[1:17:35] person yet his name was not in that
[1:17:39] scripture it didn't say this
[1:17:41] scripture is written for John the
[1:17:45] Baptist a father of
[1:17:49] Zar it was not written that
[1:17:52] way that why when the scripture come
[1:17:54] when the Pharisees they
[1:17:57] came and they read the same scripture
[1:17:59] that John is
[1:18:01] reading it doesn't reveal to them
[1:18:05] anywhere because it was not talking
[1:18:08] about them it was talking to a specific
[1:18:12] individual so when John is reading that
[1:18:16] SCP the word was becoming flesh in
[1:18:19] him the word was manifesting in him
[1:18:23] hallelujah amen there is a
[1:18:26] difference for
[1:18:29] instance um whom can I
[1:18:33] use
[1:18:34] shame sorry for using your
[1:18:37] name brother shame recently became a
[1:18:42] father now his wife is being in her
[1:18:48] family now if brother shame wanted to
[1:18:52] write a letter
[1:18:56] for his
[1:18:57] wife he will have a lot of things to
[1:19:02] say so when he's writing that
[1:19:05] image he just
[1:19:08] says I love you my
[1:19:10] wife and he sent that
[1:19:14] email
[1:19:16] orer to his
[1:19:18] wife now when his wife reads that
[1:19:23] scripture when she reads that
[1:19:26] letter she knows it was not for
[1:19:31] everyone she knows it was specifically
[1:19:34] written for
[1:19:36] her and she knows he has a lot of things
[1:19:38] to
[1:19:41] say the unwritten letter she will read
[1:19:45] it what he meant to say she will
[1:19:50] understand Hallelujah am what is it it
[1:19:54] is Called
[1:19:55] Love they are
[1:19:58] loved now for let's say something
[1:20:01] happened when when he was sending a a
[1:20:06] message maybe that letter fall on the
[1:20:09] ground and someone picked it up he read
[1:20:13] the
[1:20:15] message he will know the the
[1:20:17] message for him it doesn't give that
[1:20:20] sense oh Hallelujah
[1:20:24] it was not giving any kind of
[1:20:27] sense so the Pharisees couldn't find the
[1:20:31] sense so they have to go to this
[1:20:34] man to explain to them who do you say
[1:20:38] you are tell us who you are Hallelujah
[1:20:42] so for him when John was reading
[1:20:45] Isaiah he knows this letter was written
[1:20:49] for he say I am the voice that cries in
[1:20:53] the wilderness
[1:20:55] Hallelujah that scripture was talking
[1:20:58] about it was not talking about any other
[1:21:00] people so that
[1:21:05] scripture hallelujah amen we thank the
[1:21:11] God so many people they will come to the
[1:21:16] message they will read the
[1:21:18] same they read the same
[1:21:21] Bible but cannot find the sense
[1:21:26] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:21:28] why you are specific you special
[1:21:31] people chosen for a special
[1:21:35] work
[1:21:37] Hallelujah let's read some
[1:21:40] quotesu hallelujah
[1:21:44] hallelujah um the prophet here speaks
[1:21:46] about reading between the lines
[1:21:54] in uh Redeemer and
[1:21:59] Redemption
[1:22:06] 55119 it says like
[1:22:08] this like to read between the
[1:22:14] lines the best part of the
[1:22:18] Bible is wrote between the
[1:22:23] lines H I love this
[1:22:27] message I love this message because John
[1:22:30] was reading the same
[1:22:32] Bible but the couldn't
[1:22:35] understand Hallelujah but they know the
[1:22:38] scripture more than
[1:22:39] him but for him when he's reading he
[1:22:43] sees his name there but for them when
[1:22:46] they reading they don't see their name
[1:22:49] there Hallelujah so this is why the
[1:22:53] prophet is saying
[1:22:54] the special part of the
[1:22:57] Bible right between those
[1:23:01] lines
[1:23:03] Hallelujah and for you to have that uh
[1:23:07] to able to read that
[1:23:10] scripture you need
[1:23:13] Revelation
[1:23:14] Hallelujah and Revelation is not your
[1:23:18] opinion Revelation is not knowing the
[1:23:22] book Revelation is not going to
[1:23:25] school Revelation is a special
[1:23:29] Union a personal
[1:23:31] relationship between you and
[1:23:33] Christ
[1:23:37] Hallelujah so when John was reading that
[1:23:41] book he was reading between the
[1:23:47] lall
[1:23:49] Hallelujah what did he
[1:23:51] read he wrote he read his name in
[1:23:57] the whatever that Bible is referring
[1:24:01] to he knows this scripture is not
[1:24:05] for he know this scripture is talking
[1:24:09] about Hallelujah and the prophet here
[1:24:13] says do you like to read between the
[1:24:18] light the best part of the
[1:24:21] Bible is wrote between the lines
[1:24:26] as I told you the other
[1:24:28] night the Bible is hid from every
[1:24:34] Seminary you don't know God by Seminary
[1:24:38] experience you know him by being born
[1:24:41] again
[1:24:44] experience hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:24:47] today you are not taking a lecture from
[1:24:50] theology experience
[1:24:55] today you are taking
[1:24:58] experience from Born Again
[1:25:01] Brothers Hallelujah I don't have any
[1:25:03] paper to show
[1:25:05] you I don't have any knowledge to tell
[1:25:07] you but one thing we know we can read
[1:25:11] between the
[1:25:12] lines and in the middle of the line I
[1:25:16] see my name I see myself and that is my
[1:25:22] identification Hallelujah that is your
[1:25:27] identification amen let's
[1:25:31] continue in
[1:25:36] 5443 the hand of the Lord comes upon him
[1:25:39] that's a
[1:25:42] title The Prophet says like
[1:25:45] this now this is between the lines
[1:25:51] friend that is the reason they fail to
[1:25:53] recog recogniz Jesus
[1:25:58] Christ when he comes they did read the
[1:26:00] scripture about
[1:26:04] it they fail to recognize
[1:26:07] him it is the same thing
[1:26:10] today we go we get we get our own ritual
[1:26:17] routines anything outside of
[1:26:21] that we don't believe it fundamentals as
[1:26:25] we can
[1:26:27] be God comes right in between the
[1:26:33] lines sometimes we fail to see
[1:26:36] it
[1:26:39] Hallelujah they read the same scripture
[1:26:42] in the the
[1:26:44] church they tell the people that the
[1:26:46] Messiah is going to be
[1:26:49] born and they C the
[1:26:52] scripture but yet when the Messiah was
[1:26:56] there they couldn't recognize him
[1:26:59] because they were reading the literal
[1:27:03] letters were they were not seeing what's
[1:27:07] between the
[1:27:09] lines that's why I told you my brother
[1:27:13] sham and his
[1:27:14] wife because of that
[1:27:17] love because of that Unity they
[1:27:20] have she knows what he has wrote for her
[1:27:26] it could be a simple
[1:27:27] letter but she knows what is going in
[1:27:31] his
[1:27:32] head understand what he's trying to say
[1:27:36] to
[1:27:38] Hallelujah sir I love reading for you
[1:27:42] quotes allow me to read some
[1:27:46] quotes possessing the gates of the
[1:27:50] enemy paragraph 29
[1:27:54] it says the Bible is a special
[1:27:57] book
[1:27:59] Hallelujah this Bible we
[1:28:02] reading it is a special
[1:28:05] book Hallelujah huj I want to say it
[1:28:08] again this Bible a special book
[1:28:12] hallelujah hallelujah because it's not
[1:28:15] talking about another
[1:28:17] church it's not talking about some
[1:28:19] Bishop it's not talking about a certain
[1:28:23] people it's not talking about any other
[1:28:26] thing this scripture is a special book
[1:28:31] because it tells about
[1:28:32] you you see your life here you see your
[1:28:36] name here it identifies your
[1:28:40] life
[1:28:42] hallelujah it's a supernatural
[1:28:46] book The Prophet says it is written so
[1:28:49] that it hides from the schools
[1:28:57] it's hidden from the school andology
[1:29:02] Jesus thank
[1:29:05] God I thank Father
[1:29:08] thee that has hidden this from the wise
[1:29:15] and and God has revealed to babes
[1:29:21] learn he's saying it's a book of love
[1:29:25] when the love of God comes in your
[1:29:28] heart then you fall in love with
[1:29:32] God
[1:29:34] hallelujah it didn't say you read and
[1:29:37] then you fall in
[1:29:39] love it says the fall the love comes to
[1:29:44] you then that will reveal himself to
[1:29:49] you when you love him that will drone
[1:29:53] him come to you
[1:29:55] and when he comes to you he will reveal
[1:29:58] something to
[1:29:59] you that's why he tell them don't go to
[1:30:03] theology we
[1:30:05] see we didn't see them they go to
[1:30:09] theology we didn't see them going to
[1:30:13] schools I didn't get it we didn't see
[1:30:15] them we didn't see them then going to
[1:30:18] schools we didn't see them going to
[1:30:20] theology
[1:30:22] schol we didn't see them God electing an
[1:30:25] educated
[1:30:27] people God has left those and come to a
[1:30:32] people who can love him Hallelujah he's
[1:30:37] not looking for
[1:30:38] Education he's not looking for the
[1:30:41] ABCs he's looking for someone who can
[1:30:43] love
[1:30:45] him Hallelujah the reason that he loves
[1:30:49] us is so he can reveal his mystery to us
[1:30:55] you don't tell your
[1:30:57] secrets to the people you you don't
[1:31:01] love people you don't
[1:31:03] have chemistry
[1:31:06] with for you to to tell
[1:31:11] something for you to reveal yourself to
[1:31:14] someone that person has to love
[1:31:17] you when they love you they know you
[1:31:21] Hallelujah
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:24] that's why God says he loved the world
[1:31:28] so
[1:31:28] much that he gave his
[1:31:31] Beyond Hallelujah and Jesus Christ
[1:31:35] didn't come for
[1:31:37] everyone Jesus Christ didn't shed his
[1:31:39] blood for
[1:31:41] everyone he prayed like this I Pray
[1:31:45] father that you may reveal this
[1:31:48] things to those I have I have revealed
[1:31:51] yourself
[1:31:54] Hallelujah Jesus Christ was not going
[1:31:56] everywhere and telling them see me see
[1:32:01] me those who
[1:32:05] understood those who loved him the
[1:32:08] most were able to understand the
[1:32:12] mystery Hallelujah they say we should
[1:32:15] not just follow
[1:32:16] him we should not just eat with him they
[1:32:20] said we should not just minister with
[1:32:21] him there is something special about
[1:32:23] this
[1:32:28] Hallelujah that's
[1:32:31] why Judah was not a bad
[1:32:36] person Judah was a very religious
[1:32:40] person he never
[1:32:42] smokes he never fought with
[1:32:45] anyone he was a religious
[1:32:50] person but before we speak about Judah
[1:32:54] the Bible says when Judah
[1:32:58] dies he went to his place he went to his
[1:33:03] identification but he tried to identify
[1:33:09] himself with the word he tries to come
[1:33:12] to church he tries to pay
[1:33:15] his he even say this one is not enough
[1:33:18] for
[1:33:19] God I have to put an own a suit I have
[1:33:22] to buy the Bible
[1:33:24] and I have to preach the
[1:33:26] people until he
[1:33:30] preach so he was
[1:33:33] preaching he was preaching the Clos
[1:33:36] book and people were shouting amen
[1:33:41] amen so Judah was not a bad
[1:33:45] person Judah was a good
[1:33:48] person but you see he was not identified
[1:33:51] he was not meant to identify with the
[1:33:53] word
[1:33:58] so when he joined the
[1:34:00] disciple he was at the wrong
[1:34:03] place when he was
[1:34:05] ministering he was at the wrong place
[1:34:08] when he's using the
[1:34:10] word he was at the wrong
[1:34:13] place when he was trying to identify
[1:34:15] himself with the
[1:34:18] scripture he was a
[1:34:21] WR so God waited for the time
[1:34:25] to reveal who this man
[1:34:28] was because one of the principle Jesus
[1:34:33] had was for the whe and the seed to grow
[1:34:38] together they grow together but one is
[1:34:42] identifying
[1:34:44] God one came from God one from
[1:34:49] God
[1:34:51] hallelujah that's why k never
[1:34:56] repented not because he was very
[1:34:59] muscular or very
[1:35:03] rebellious he was a religious
[1:35:06] man but in him inside
[1:35:11] the doesn't have any space for
[1:35:15] repentance he was not there to identify
[1:35:18] himself with
[1:35:20] this so the first Mark we see
[1:35:25] that God has
[1:35:27] applied
[1:35:29] was he put on the
[1:35:31] mark and he
[1:35:34] went the Mark will be
[1:35:38] applied those who cannot
[1:35:41] repent those who cannot be baptized
[1:35:44] in the reason they are not baptized in
[1:35:46] his
[1:35:47] name is not because they are
[1:35:50] stupid it's because they don't see their
[1:35:53] name in his name
[1:35:57] Hallelujah but for you when the name is
[1:36:00] called you will say Amen because that is
[1:36:03] your
[1:36:05] identification Hallelujah you identify
[1:36:08] with him in
[1:36:09] burial you identify with him in
[1:36:12] Resurrection Hallelujah your job doesn't
[1:36:15] identify
[1:36:17] you you go through doesn't
[1:36:20] identify that's why they identify Jesus
[1:36:23] as a
[1:36:26] carpenter they told him this is a son of
[1:36:30] Joseph that's what we
[1:36:33] know they are not
[1:36:35] wrong they identifying the
[1:36:39] man with what He surround
[1:36:44] himself
[1:36:46] Hallelujah so you your name is in the
[1:36:50] scripture Hallelujah your name is in the
[1:36:53] scripture
[1:36:55] Judah couldn't find
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:58] himself that's why you see him
[1:37:01] sometimes could I be here can I be there
[1:37:05] can I use my
[1:37:07] gifts to get some
[1:37:10] money that's why we get so amazed
[1:37:14] today when some so called Prophet
[1:37:20] comes and he says youing sister rise
[1:37:26] up your name is so and so your name is
[1:37:30] so and so and that lady will
[1:37:33] shout that lady will say God knows my
[1:37:38] name but yet he has called her
[1:37:42] name in the
[1:37:44] scripture but people
[1:37:46] refer Prophet calling out names
[1:37:57] so if they don't call their
[1:38:02] names so if they don't call their
[1:38:05] names God doesn't know God doesn't know
[1:38:10] if God knows her how come I not be
[1:38:15] known that is the deception we have
[1:38:18] today that is a decision we have today
[1:38:21] in the
[1:38:22] church people are there to be called
[1:38:24] names by
[1:38:27] person and I get so
[1:38:31] confused because when God
[1:38:33] calls whenever I hear his
[1:38:36] voice I know it was for a hard
[1:38:40] time it is he's going to speak something
[1:38:43] against my
[1:38:45] flesh he's going to tell me something to
[1:38:47] do against my flesh he's going to tell
[1:38:50] me something I did not from my will
[1:38:57] that is a voice I
[1:38:59] know the voice comes with an
[1:39:03] instruction
[1:39:05] Hallelujah so that's the voice I
[1:39:08] know there are times I said when when
[1:39:11] I'm going to hear that there is some
[1:39:13] atmosphere I'm going to be
[1:39:16] in when that and when that voice comes
[1:39:19] there is a certain fear I
[1:39:22] have there is certain fear I
[1:39:25] had and when that voice comes it comes
[1:39:29] straight
[1:39:30] forward against your
[1:39:32] will against your
[1:39:35] flesh the the voice of God is not used
[1:39:39] for
[1:39:40] jokes it's not used just to call out
[1:39:43] your
[1:39:44] names when the voice comes he comes for
[1:39:47] a work when the voice comes he comes to
[1:39:51] do something
[1:39:55] Hallelujah right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:58] so that's the voice God
[1:40:01] has hallelujah
[1:40:03] hallelujah so
[1:40:05] Judah preached the word people were
[1:40:08] saying
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:11] rece he said even now this one is not
[1:40:15] enough because I know
[1:40:17] Jesus I had to go to people's
[1:40:20] house I have to pray for them I go to
[1:40:23] their
[1:40:24] lives I prophesy to
[1:40:27] them but
[1:40:29] yet Judah was not identified with
[1:40:34] Christ he tried to be with
[1:40:37] Jesus yet he was
[1:40:40] not let's read the
[1:40:42] scripture about
[1:40:45] Judas 1
[1:40:51] ver Acts chapter 1:
[1:40:56] 24 and they prayed and
[1:40:59] said thou Lord which knows the heart of
[1:41:03] all men shows whether of this uh thou H
[1:41:07] has chosen that he may take the part of
[1:41:11] this ministry and apostleship for which
[1:41:14] Judas by transgression fa that he might
[1:41:18] go to his own place and they gave forth
[1:41:21] their lots and the lot
[1:41:23] fell upon the Matas and he he was
[1:41:28] numbered with the 11 apostle
[1:42:01] so
[1:42:02] Judas was not
[1:42:05] meant to be the
[1:42:08] disciples but he tried to identify
[1:42:11] himself he tried to say I'm the
[1:42:14] preacher he tried to say I'm the
[1:42:16] follower of Jesus Christ he was
[1:42:20] not but those who were deceived
[1:42:23] as much as he can he has
[1:42:27] deceived hallelujah amen you know Mary
[1:42:31] was a special
[1:42:34] woman the the angel could go to many
[1:42:40] womans but he chose specifically to come
[1:42:43] to
[1:42:46] Mary Hallelujah and when the angel of
[1:42:49] the Lord could to comes for an
[1:42:51] individual
[1:42:54] he comes for a specific
[1:42:56] work Hallelujah after the angel has left
[1:43:02] her Mary was not the same now Mary has a
[1:43:06] message Mary has a message for her
[1:43:09] day
[1:43:12] Hallelujah so whenever we read read the
[1:43:15] book of our Prophet brother
[1:43:21] Bram we read it
[1:43:24] we cannot be the
[1:43:25] same when the angel of the Lord comes to
[1:43:28] an
[1:43:31] individual it comes to change your
[1:43:36] lifeall it comes to change your
[1:43:38] life it comes to change your
[1:43:42] appetite that's why Mary after she
[1:43:45] received the word her appetite was
[1:43:49] changed she was telling her
[1:43:51] husband this food now I can
[1:43:54] this one is not for
[1:43:56] me it was the word that is making her to
[1:43:59] do
[1:44:00] that because the word that she has
[1:44:03] received has pregnated
[1:44:06] her and hallelujah hallelujah what going
[1:44:09] to be born it was going to
[1:44:12] manifest Hallelujah the word that we are
[1:44:15] reading is not just for hearing it has
[1:44:19] to be made flesh in your
[1:44:21] life hallelu
[1:44:24] people so much focus on the 2,000 years
[1:44:26] of Jesus
[1:44:30] Christ where the word made
[1:44:33] flesh but right now
[1:44:35] also the word is becoming
[1:44:38] flesh Hallelujah the word is becoming
[1:44:41] flesh in
[1:44:42] you
[1:44:44] Hallelujah when they are quoting Jesus
[1:44:46] they are quoting
[1:44:48] you when they are quoting the scripture
[1:44:51] they are quoting you
[1:44:53] your name is in the scripture your name
[1:44:55] is in the word you didn't come from
[1:44:58] somewhere you didn't come from
[1:45:01] somewhere from the Bible you came from
[1:45:04] the word and you go back
[1:45:07] from hallelujah hallelujah the devil has
[1:45:11] once deceived
[1:45:12] us he took us away from our
[1:45:17] identification he took us away from the
[1:45:20] scripture but God has said I will not
[1:45:23] leave my people
[1:45:25] alone I will not leave my people alone I
[1:45:29] have heard my people's cry I have heard
[1:45:32] my people's cry I will come down
[1:45:35] myself Hallelujah God has come down with
[1:45:40] a message to restore us back to our
[1:45:44] position hallelujah our position is the
[1:45:48] scripture
[1:45:51] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:53] hallelujah
[1:45:56] hallelujah that's why I thank God so
[1:45:59] much hallelujah hallelujah he gave us a
[1:46:02] second
[1:46:05] opportunity to become like
[1:46:09] him Hallelujah not to become your father
[1:46:13] not to become your
[1:46:15] sister Hallelujah but to come your
[1:46:19] maker
[1:46:21] hallelujah amen
[1:46:24] that
[1:46:26] image is being restored
[1:46:29] back Hallelujah your
[1:46:32] identification is his
[1:46:35] image and you are going back
[1:46:37] there
[1:46:39] Hallelujah is my time okay all right
[1:46:43] Mary when the word
[1:46:46] comes it changed her
[1:46:49] appetite it changed the way she lives
[1:46:54] what she was eating she changed this is
[1:46:57] not for
[1:46:58] me the angel has come and he has spoke
[1:47:02] the word to me and right now I'm not
[1:47:04] like any other
[1:47:06] woman Hallelujah she's a special because
[1:47:09] the angel chose
[1:47:11] her you are special because God has
[1:47:14] chosen
[1:47:15] you you could have gone to
[1:47:17] Seminary he could have gone to the big
[1:47:20] palaces but he chose you
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:29] hallelujah he choses
[1:47:32] you and Mary identify
[1:47:37] herself with the word that it was
[1:47:41] spoken she know she was not like any
[1:47:45] other she say I'm not like any other
[1:47:48] woman woman that God has
[1:47:51] chosen so when I'm going to the
[1:47:54] kitchen it's for a purpose when I'm
[1:47:57] going for
[1:47:59] church it's for a purpose when I'm doing
[1:48:02] my work it's for purpose you are here
[1:48:05] for
[1:48:06] purpose to identify
[1:48:09] God on Earth
[1:48:12] Hallelujah to represent
[1:48:15] God on Earth hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:48:19] right now A Unity is happening
[1:48:25] a is taking
[1:48:28] place hallelujah

[1:48:58] knows her identification is
[1:49:02] ahead
[1:49:03] [Applause]
[1:49:05] Hallelujah let us read some
[1:49:09] scripture I'm going to jump many
[1:49:12] things I read this
[1:49:16] one Genesis chap Genesis 24
[1:49:23] verse
[1:49:29] 61 24:
[1:49:34] 61 and RKA

[1:49:44] the servant took Rebecca and went with
[1:49:48] uh went his way and Isaac came from the
[1:49:52] way of the well lar for he dwelt in the
[1:49:57] South
[1:49:58] Country and Isaac went out to Med uh to
[1:50:02] meditate in the field at the uh evented
[1:50:05] and he left up his eyes and saw and
[1:50:09] behold the camel were coming and Rebeca
[1:50:13] lifted her eyes and when she saw Isaac
[1:50:17] she slightly uh she lightly off the
[1:50:21] camels for she she said unto the servant
[1:50:25] what man is that WTH in the field
[1:50:29] meeting us and the servant had said it
[1:50:33] is my master therefore she took a veil
[1:50:38] and covered herself Hallelujah you can
[1:50:51] read for
[1:51:34] she took the
[1:51:36] veil and covered
[1:51:39] herself
[1:51:40] why you
[1:51:45] see was not looking for a a beauty on
[1:51:49] the field
[1:51:53] he didn't came out with the mindset of
[1:51:55] who is the beautiful
[1:52:00] one El was sent to look for a
[1:52:05] character that will fit the
[1:52:09] head Hallelujah so he was looking for a
[1:52:14] character when this message is coming to
[1:52:18] us it was not to tell
[1:52:21] us we need more education or
[1:52:25] that it was to tell
[1:52:27] us that we must fit that
[1:52:31] head Hallelujah it was looking for a
[1:52:35] character that will reign with Jesus
[1:52:39] Christ Hallelujah a
[1:52:42] character that was the church that he is
[1:52:44] having that was the
[1:52:48] search so Ela went for looking for a
[1:52:51] character
[1:52:54] that will
[1:52:55] fit the head amen
[1:53:00] hallelujah I'll read this and I'll
[1:53:03] finish in the message the seven
[1:53:08] churches
[1:53:13] Church the prophet
[1:53:16] said swe it
[1:53:19] out until he found
[1:53:25] that's right Hallelujah he he his
[1:53:28] intention was not
[1:53:31] anything how good she is or how smart
[1:53:33] she is he was looking for a
[1:53:37] church that will
[1:53:39] fit the head our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:53:44] will obey him that will obey his word
[1:53:47] that will say Amen to the word that will
[1:53:50] say Amen to the word hallelujah
[1:53:54] hallelujah
[1:53:56] so swe it
[1:53:59] out until he found
[1:54:02] character who would he
[1:54:05] get and he trusted
[1:54:09] God and the character for
[1:54:13] what for
[1:54:17] Isaac which is the type of the
[1:54:21] church that was the natural Seed of
[1:54:26] Abraham this is the Royal Seed of
[1:54:31] Abraham the
[1:54:33] messenger hunting the
[1:54:36] bright and trying to find
[1:54:39] character if that man is
[1:54:42] come the messenger of the last day
[1:54:46] trying to find the bride of Christ he
[1:54:49] will not look for the denomination
[1:54:50] member
[1:54:52] will look for the
[1:54:54] character Hallelujah and that is the
[1:54:57] will of
[1:54:58] God character is the will of God without
[1:55:01] character we cannot
[1:55:03] rent Hallelujah
[1:55:07] character will identify us with
[1:55:11] Christ your character will identify us
[1:55:14] with
[1:55:16] Christ that's why they came to
[1:55:18] John because his character was somehow
[1:55:21] telling them
[1:55:25] something so they have to come to him
[1:55:28] and they tell him who
[1:55:31] are you see sometimes we fail from our
[1:55:36] identification because we think it's so
[1:55:40] hard there is times we fail in
[1:55:44] life there is times I I have gone to
[1:55:48] this I have given my life for this
[1:55:52] but nothing is adding
[1:55:54] up and the devil sneaks
[1:55:57] in makes his way and make us fall from
[1:56:04] our that's why God is full of
[1:56:09] grace when he called
[1:56:12] Adam Adam was not in his
[1:56:16] position Adam lost his
[1:56:18] position so when God came to the ID
[1:56:24] he didn't call Adam a
[1:56:26] sinner he didn't identify Adam as a
[1:56:29] sinner because he know it was the devil
[1:56:33] purpose to take him down if it was the
[1:56:38] devil he would said you you
[1:56:40] sinner you have sinned God will not love
[1:56:44] you you are a sinner God will not never
[1:56:47] love
[1:56:49] you but when God comes
[1:56:52] he called him Adam
[1:56:54] Adam where thou his sin never change his
[1:57:01] identity Hallelujah his situation never
[1:57:04] changed his
[1:57:06] identity God didn't say now he has done
[1:57:09] this
[1:57:10] Mist let me change from
[1:57:13] Adam to
[1:57:15] Jacob never change his name God

[1:58:24] name people that are called by th
[1:58:27] name Hallelujah when your name is there
