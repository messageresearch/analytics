will heal her a solomon also as you have heard it traveled early in the morning uh was it last night and a show i know some have been asking he told me that his mom was sick and so he had he had an appointment with the doctor for to operate on the eyes uh brother polly kept giving a prayer request say try your best to come to church on sundays never cook but for kids no one was telling me that some students at school what were you a young man i feel bad i just feel like going home what what's the word they use bacon is that the gambot i believe a child of god should also be under stress if they refuse to go to church so this morning by the grace of god already i have a subject i want to take from what we have read and i want you to follow me closely the same god who uses them is the same god that uses it and his word is the same it is a church praise the lord come here so we don't boss over any ability the true enemy is supposed to be the best in the ability of the word of god to transform our lives and give us what we need to watch so i have a very funny subject do not go very fast negative these words were not spoken by me but by pharaoh if you can't move in the caesar and pharaoh is uh was a man who thought he was god falafel just like we had a man here in uganda and he was able to convince people to believe him and instantly is a man out of my own tribe so in our tribe we had a god so sometimes when i tell people my name is they asked me are you also part of osaka's religious that is because he comes from the same tribe like i do that name is meant to say he is the one with all authority because god has no beginning and god has not ended until he had been coming and that's why when jesus died he rose again when jesus died he rose again yes [Music] egypt and they missed it it was through their great grandparents and you remember how joseph was so blessed and how he was favored even among the foreigners the egyptians and how god used him in a mighty way and how they received him and all his people able now and they gave them a place for and that place was called gossip so they lived in goshen for most of their lives you have to understand many died and many were born casually others died and others were born but all of them were born into becoming servants of pharaoh [Music] amen who has experienced in those things to help us know where all of you are holy oh my gosh brother you also don't know don't feel bad it is just a testimony all people are scratching their heads you know what it is it is something they dress [Music] we are born in this tradition we are born we find ourselves some of you you found ourselves wearing um how do they call uh i don't know these words you know you'll excuse me you know rosaries all you know is it's a family tradition [Music] you find yourself bowing before images you don't know why but all you know you are born in that tradition are you now about it [Music] [Music] anyone who knew me when i was young i was a defender of my religion one day i told my mother i said don't worry about me because there were some people teaching me this message [Applause] [Music] a friend saying not a framework when we go out but you can never we don't got to collect people until we are not people collect us we are reaching out to the predestinated seed of god [Music] [Music] and so [Music] him when he was twenty thirty forty fifty six the seventh petrol but god waited at eight i've had some of you regret oh i wish i knew this truth when i was twenty nine again [Music] because we identify let the name of kirisa and i'm following the message as i will speak for maybe one hour it's 12 so maybe by one i'll be done so i want you to follow me closely yo why do you have a gun for the football game oh brother isaac god bless you all come come and come back for jesus so i want you to support your team you can comment here let and sacrifice to the devil has no problem with you serving god satan but where is that inaudible the devil has no plan in hindering you from serving god satan is aware as long as you he wants you to serve god i cannot wait he wants you to be born again oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and all the saints will listen for they got all the angels really sinful they cannot join that song when i redeem a gathering take the chorus with me now who went down [Music] relief i will say [Music] [Music] [Music] unto the lord to set down and we are and the devil has a way that he can trap people he will tell them you can worship the lord and you do what you have been doing no cigarette go what have you ever done as long as you pay your tithe custody and you bring your offerings to the church no i remember your mechanism is okay you know you can remain with your girlfriend you know what i was doing [Music] as long as you are also paying his taxes [Music] [Music] [Music] baptized into [Music] supposed to rule [Music] fully mumbai it is like saying you went to the shrine to to because you wanted some quiet time and so i went to the shrine [Music] but i was not really doing what they were doing nevertheless i just wanted to exercise my mind and everything how can you serve god atmosphere you cannot serve god and mama [Music] [Music] like prostitutes on the pulpit with with fingernails as for birds they can't even cry because they don't know how to clean their eyes this is so full of pain that it will just go down is how can we sacrifice [Music] satani his plan and he doesn't want us to go far because when he came to uh they they used the lights when they refused to remain without god no signal in the land you told them okay you can leave my denomination religion teachings and god worship okay now with it together one two three go cut the summation only okay one more time one two three go only you shall not go very but they are not actually christians for christianity because they have obeyed the commandment of satan they are christians but they are not going so deep into christianity naomi crystal the bible when you go so deep into christianity they will call you a fool bro they will call you a holy roller [Applause] because they want you to do what they do they will tell you i am a christian and i do this and i have been a christian for 20 years oh we need to separate the church from the world church is a place where we meet god for what it is it is different from an entertainment whole place [Music] but verses i think is it 16 i'm not quite sure just quickly be really fast i am rich [Applause] [Music] if you cannot open quickly just look on the screen and just write down those scriptures so we can go together amen [Applause] no [Applause] [Music] that is [Music] or whatever living in you manifesting it outside the way what is it god dried in the fire so i am rich [Music] and repentance means is the beginning don't go very fast he knows we are we are going to be washed personally i'm an individual and the devil can never hinder us to worship god you may delay us but he cannot be in the ass from stop me from washing it you can bring his temptations like a river i don't care maybe think about last year [Music] he says there is no you you've seen you there's no use to pray somebody who knows it look at my teeth [Music] and yes but what how does that start brother did you get this i see a crimson stream of blood but then i want is it in that stance oh my i just i just wanted brother did you get it okay give me that stanza split up for us so so i can put it for me up here so i can see it i i want you to hear these words you're always the target of the devil me okay continue i have not seen it yet there you go when gloom and sadness we spa and naku no [Music] and he tells me to say what does he tell you to say i see a crimson street if you see it sing it [Music] [Music] [Music] put for us on the screen revelation 13. ordinary iraq coming in here and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which you had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did leave and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause and cause that as many as would worship the image of the beast should be killed and it causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bound to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads some people have been saying that this mark of the beast is going to be received through vaccinations and they have told and scared people to resist or disease from being vaccinated i want to say that it's just not true however much i would like to believe it but it's not true i got the chick it is an institute because you have already been given a shower the profession we know the mark of the beast is real [Music] what is this image which will be made like under the beast it's going to be the union of all denominations together we already sing it for me to cheer [Music] of the [Music] under [Music] and as many as you would not worship the image of the beast should be killed ejaculated i will never touch since the cabinet when we talk about one world religion but together could be me and see your name it's a reality and it's already for me if you are not a member what do you think i mean are you not that is true that is true i don't have time to get into this and so we find that this one world religion an opinion will [Music] we know that those will be the foolish so when they'll be king that's why the bride of christ will not go through the tribulation the main nominal church will go through the tribulations [Music] and amen there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are oh help me now with the father faith [Music] it is burning now within my heart oh glory to his name i'm so glad [Music] i'm i will not worship the image of the beast that you find in your church i am one of them i am a member amen i wonder galatians 1 verse 6 i marvel but ye soon you are soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel he says he knows he in of christ such a crystal to another gospel let me ask you a question who is he talking to here anyone [Music] move with them which is such a crisis the gospel i'm trying to go into the depths of holiness don't dress like an old woman you know put some spice on it [Music] [Music] shall have assumed that they are wearing bumble and buddy and to make matters worse they are telling me if they find a sister like this one wearing a very good dress what which fandom of the police officers a java city carry checking how how long their dresses chino charity give me a moment i'll show you this picture this is how serious it is but we noticed today ah it's not no longer the story uh what makes it so bad at the church has connived with the devil about the gospel of christ thank god for you hallelujah i want to show you this picture what happened everything can change you i understand that times change i understand all that even change one thing i know that you know does out of the outside [Music] and then he will begin you see our generation has been perverted we challenge it to the gospel and the preachers perverting it is a somebody who has to answer for the little baby he's a big person where do you find that in the bible [Music] [Music] what has gone wrong what has gone wrong oh is it he's not supposed to be that way baby take it when you speak about what it's supposed to be you are called a first preacher because the people themselves don't don't want to hear that pastor [Music] catholicism they say you're not spiritual where do you find that in the bible you all speak in tongues do all speak today and then no there is no interpretation you will not understand what i'm saying but then he says if someone speaks [Applause] [Music] angelia charm is the one but there'll be some who pervert the gospel of christ so the next time you hear a preacher a pastor a prophet or whatever [Music] [Music] today there is a perimeter to know with the authority to change [Music] that what has been given is enough [Music] but people choose to believe they are preachers rather than the word that's why the prophet said if you want to get deeper in christ when the may god and then he says in the book of god 1 6 that he has soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ another i think we've read that then in jude 1 we read jude 1 4 he says for there are certain men crept in unawares young who were before of all ordained to this condemnation ungodly men are said yeah turning the grace of god into las vegas they come from the training of man the training of the holy ghost wants to use you now he doesn't want the support of man that is what he has used from the very [Music] amen but these men never said about where did they come from the next thing you know they are on the pulpit telling you everyone hug [Music] oh [Music] what is happening teaching chickens they are done in the grace of god no matter how spiritual you are never even if you are baptized never [Music] it has to be the correct name for meaning they have to speak those words of the lord jesus christ of the church he's not a preacher of all this is not our reference it is jesus yeshua is the shepherd of our soul yes our faith is our high priest hallelujah oh suffering they shall leave to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables can you imagine [Music] did you know that believers [Music] have accuracy should have only fiances [Music] and wives meaning by the time you get a girlfriend you are intending to get married keep your old cultural traditions english to those traditions of the dead christians should not be in such a christian it is sanctioned by gods but journey into the wilderness but i guess we'll deal with that next time but for today let's read this course be [Music] this is [Music] [Music] give [Music] we don't believe in words this is not me only since he said every one of us say nobody wanna know it used to be that when we came in the message one thing that attracted us into a chat security it was alive those people [Music] jeffersonville but i
