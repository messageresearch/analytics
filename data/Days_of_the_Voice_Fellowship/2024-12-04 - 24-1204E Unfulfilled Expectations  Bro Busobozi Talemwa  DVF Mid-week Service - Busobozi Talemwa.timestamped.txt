[49:59] and you can be able to get the link
[50:04] there this evening I'm speaking on
[50:06] unfulfilled
[50:08] [Music]
[50:12] expectations we are coming to the end of
[50:14] the
[50:15] year um today is 4th
[50:19] December we only have about um just
[50:22] maybe 3 weeks or
[50:25] less uh to end the year and then and
[50:29] then you know when usually when the year
[50:31] a year is
[50:33] beginning many people plan
[50:37] things and um you know by the end of the
[50:39] year I will accomplish
[50:43] ABCD so now usually at a time like
[50:48] this many people are feeling many of
[50:51] them that they have unfulfilled
[50:54] expectations
[50:59] they plan things and they see that my
[51:01] list is not yet
[51:05] Al accomplished maybe 20% or 30 or 40 or
[51:09] 60 or
[51:11] 80 some even decide to go into
[51:17] depression because they feel that time
[51:19] is
[51:20] running and they left
[51:23] behind and things did not work out the
[51:25] way they had
[51:28] many times many people go into um uh
[51:34] anxiety and
[51:37] depression because of unfulfilled
[51:42] expectations look at it this way if
[51:45] someone was to give you a
[51:48] promise and say tomorrow you will come
[51:51] to me I'll give you 1 million
[51:54] Shillings and you go to to him tomorrow
[51:57] and he says oh I'm sorry I don't have
[52:01] it you will have a broken
[52:04] heart not because you've not um not
[52:08] because he failed to get the
[52:11] money but because he promised you and so
[52:14] you would say why did you promise me if
[52:16] you if you were you knew you not going
[52:18] to accomplish
[52:20] it so unfulfilled expectations
[52:28] is a um something that is a source of
[52:31] many
[52:34] heartbreaks spiritually
[52:37] psychologically you know
[52:41] physically maybe some of you listening
[52:43] to me
[52:45] today you have unfulfilled
[52:51] expectations and you know to expect
[52:54] something
[52:56] you know it is sure
[52:57] deal and then it doesn't happen it is
[53:02] unfulfilled it is usually
[53:05] painful it is usually
[53:08] heartbreaking but today I want to speak
[53:10] on unfulfilled
[53:14] expectations and the Lord will give us
[53:16] Grace to be able to address um our needs
[53:21] tonight I plan on speaking on something
[53:24] else
[53:26] and um then the the last night I
[53:29] couldn't um get a hold on
[53:33] it so I let it go I just went to bed
[53:37] then I woke up very early in the
[53:40] morning and I was still you know
[53:42] pondering to see what the holy spirit
[53:43] will give
[53:45] me and I couldn't get it so the whole
[53:49] day I've been
[53:51] laboring maybe there was still someone
[53:54] praying
[53:57] oh God was waiting for someone to
[53:59] pray so that he can lay something on my
[54:02] heart and so I couldn't get
[54:06] anything until later on maybe at 2 3
[54:09] p.m.
[54:10] today you know the so sweet
[54:14] friends I heard like a
[54:18] whisper unfulfilled
[54:22] expectation that is how I got that
[54:25] title and so when I got it I began
[54:27] shouting and
[54:30] rejoicing and then I said now Lord I've
[54:32] had the title but where am I preaching
[54:37] from and and so he began to lead me to
[54:41] um several courts of the
[54:44] Prophet but first he gave me this
[54:46] scripture
[54:49] on N the leaper and so we will really
[54:52] best on that as we see how the Lord will
[54:55] lead us tonight
[54:58] so the Bible says Nam was a captain of
[55:01] the hor of the king of
[55:04] Assyria he was a great man with his
[55:07] master he was
[55:10] honorable and you know I want you to
[55:12] imagine a captain of the host of The
[55:15] King he was a great man with his
[55:19] master he was
[55:22] honorable you know like we have MPS we
[55:25] call honorable
[55:28] and now here is something that really
[55:29] moved me he said the Lord by him gave
[55:33] Deliverance to
[55:38] Syria there is no one that is great that
[55:41] God has not made
[55:44] great whether he's among the house those
[55:47] among from those of the house of the
[55:49] Lord or from
[55:51] outside even Kings and presidents
[55:56] determines all those
[55:58] things so this man was made honorable by
[56:01] God I
[56:03] believe he was honorable he was a great
[56:06] man with his
[56:07] master he was a captain of the host of
[56:10] the
[56:11] king and the
[56:13] Lord not another God the same God we
[56:17] worship had amen gave Deliverance to
[56:20] Syria by
[56:23] him and so he was a mighty man of
[56:28] You' call him a great
[56:30] man
[56:31] brave but despite all of these
[56:34] accomplishments that n
[56:38] had n was a
[56:41] leaper tell your neighbor was a
[56:45] leap and so I wondered why the Holy
[56:48] Spirit Led me there and I began to look
[56:49] at
[56:52] leprosy and in the message the
[56:54] resurrection of Lazarus
[56:57] the prophet says
[56:59] leprosy there was no cure for
[57:04] leprosy they haven't found it
[57:07] yet only God can cure
[57:12] leprosy they haven't found nothing for
[57:15] it to help it but leprosy is a type of
[57:21] sin it sets in so gradually
[57:26] it is
[57:27] painless you don't feel the pain when
[57:29] you are getting
[57:31] it it's not like
[57:33] malaria Begin by headache and fever and
[57:37] joint pain
[57:39] and comes in so gradually and
[57:44] painless just moves right
[57:47] in my my I have it's like very loud
[57:50] brother if you can put it like put it a
[57:52] little down okay so they haven't found
[57:55] even nothing for it
[57:58] says just moves right in you don't know
[58:02] it until you are
[58:05] dying big white big white whats come out
[58:09] all over
[58:10] [Music]
[58:12] you Lim limbs drop off and
[58:17] everything eat you right into just eats
[58:20] you
[58:23] up Jesus was the only one who could K
[58:26] this
[58:27] [Music]
[58:28] leprosy are you following me Church he's
[58:31] the only one only the only one
[58:34] today who can heal this
[58:38] liy now this message brother bam spoke
[58:40] it in
[58:43] 1953 and I was searching by the
[58:49] 1980s they found the Cure of
[58:53] leprosy but you know I also found is not
[58:56] a really permanent
[59:00] cure because Li say the chances of it
[59:04] reoccurring after someone has been cured
[59:06] are very
[59:11] high so Li being a type of
[59:15] sin represents anything that upsets your
[59:18] walk with the
[59:22] Lord lipro represents anything that
[59:25] upsets your walk with the
[59:29] [Music]
[59:31] Lord I want you to imagine something
[59:33] that eats you up
[59:36] slowly something that you have been
[59:39] forced to live
[59:42] with you know you you are forced to live
[59:44] with
[59:45] it it could only you know it can be
[59:48] anything it can be
[59:51] poverty you know people here in Africa
[59:53] by the it has been said
[59:56] you know many people have gone
[59:59] mad they have become
[1:00:01] mental because of
[1:00:04] poverty one time I'll talk about
[1:00:06] poverty as a subject very good
[1:00:09] subject many have lost their
[1:00:12] mind because of poverty you know if you
[1:00:15] want to know how they can become
[1:00:18] mad just look at the man the husband in
[1:00:21] the home without
[1:00:24] money many men without money are very
[1:00:27] very
[1:00:29] angry they like a
[1:00:31] lion you don't want you to say
[1:00:34] anything why because there is no money
[1:00:37] but when there is money is all
[1:00:39] happy many many problems here in Africa
[1:00:42] that we have both physically and
[1:00:45] spiritually can be solved when you get
[1:00:52] money oh I I said I would talk about
[1:00:54] that as a subject later
[1:00:57] so you see poverty can be your
[1:01:01] leprosy disappointment can be your
[1:01:05] lios maybe you have an
[1:01:07] addiction it is eating you
[1:01:10] slowly is your lios some of you you have
[1:01:15] failure and you done many things and you
[1:01:18] have failed at
[1:01:20] it and you feel you are a
[1:01:22] failure so it has become your liy
[1:01:26] and others have
[1:01:28] heartbreaks oh all these subjects we we
[1:01:30] could spend a lot of time on
[1:01:32] them heart breaks also can be a big
[1:01:37] lios maybe you are sick in the body and
[1:01:42] you know something becomes an
[1:01:45] encumbrance and you know it becomes your
[1:01:48] leprosy fear some people have
[1:01:51] fear whatever they want to do they then
[1:01:54] fear comes and overwhelming
[1:01:58] or maybe someone wants to do something
[1:02:00] or go apply for a job or go to school or
[1:02:03] go do that and fear comes
[1:02:08] over you know some of those people
[1:02:10] you've seen them even they can't talk to
[1:02:13] someone if they go to someone older than
[1:02:17] them they're shaking they shaking no one
[1:02:21] has some of them even begun you know
[1:02:23] tears
[1:02:24] coming no one has beat there no one has
[1:02:27] said anything negative but fear has come
[1:02:30] over them it can be a
[1:02:33] leprosy some of them become
[1:02:36] hopeless and hopelessness can also
[1:02:38] become a
[1:02:40] lios
[1:02:43] defeat and I'm going to speak one by one
[1:02:45] that the Holy Spirit made known to me as
[1:02:47] I was
[1:02:50] studying and you know when why when your
[1:02:52] lios is mentioned right there you know
[1:02:54] God is going to speak to me
[1:02:59] you know when you become
[1:03:01] hopeless you you go into a
[1:03:04] state where you don't see hope
[1:03:08] anywhere no one can advise you no one
[1:03:12] can talk to you that's why hopelessness
[1:03:15] can make even people commit
[1:03:19] suicide a girl who had kept
[1:03:22] herself she can reach a point she's
[1:03:26] hopeless and she feels no one will marry
[1:03:29] me no one wants to marry me so let me go
[1:03:33] and leave
[1:03:34] worldly why it is the liy of
[1:03:38] hopelessness That Came Upon them and
[1:03:42] made them do that and some of them have
[1:03:45] a lios of
[1:03:48] defeat
[1:03:50] anxiety you know you think and think and
[1:03:53] think and think
[1:03:55] the deeper you think about the
[1:03:59] situation the more closed doors you
[1:04:04] see and so you become
[1:04:06] anxious you go into
[1:04:09] depression so it becomes a
[1:04:12] leprosy others have a lios of
[1:04:15] unbelief they hear the word but it can't
[1:04:20] enter
[1:04:21] joblessness you know complexes
[1:04:25] oh my these are all good subjects to
[1:04:27] talk about
[1:04:28] friends people have many many different
[1:04:32] complexes someone can have a complex
[1:04:35] that me I'm not
[1:04:38] loved and just from from from
[1:04:41] nowhere they wake up and think that they
[1:04:44] are not
[1:04:46] loved they wake up and think everybody
[1:04:48] doesn't appreciate
[1:04:50] them you know they just wake up and say
[1:04:53] I think this woman hurts me
[1:04:57] it's a
[1:04:59] complex some of them can even dream a
[1:05:01] dream after thinking so
[1:05:05] much someone you know running after them
[1:05:07] with a
[1:05:09] p simply because they had a they had a
[1:05:14] complex that says bewitching me that's
[1:05:18] why in the message we don't believe in
[1:05:21] wichcraft we know witchcraft is in the
[1:05:23] world but we don't believe that they can
[1:05:24] be witchers
[1:05:28] but in the world you know people just
[1:05:30] even a m someone looking at you begin to
[1:05:32] think oh I think he's going to
[1:05:37] be simply because of having
[1:05:41] complexes you do not have I say tonight
[1:05:45] to leave with any of that Li that you
[1:05:52] have was a leaper
[1:05:55] but you see the problem
[1:05:57] with he never laid in the presence of
[1:06:03] God there is something about the
[1:06:05] presence of
[1:06:06] God that when you walk into the presence
[1:06:09] of
[1:06:10] God every
[1:06:12] liy has to be
[1:06:14] healed every
[1:06:16] complex every problem every poverty
[1:06:20] whatever your Li
[1:06:23] is you see when you walk into that
[1:06:26] presence it becomes no
[1:06:29] more I want you to hear in the message
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:34] supernatural says
[1:06:36] notice this man was a great
[1:06:40] fellow but he was a
[1:06:42] leaper there is so many people
[1:06:45] today even even I'm sad to
[1:06:49] say but even in the
[1:06:53] Pulpit that there's great man
[1:06:57] but listens to man's
[1:07:00] theology instead of staying in the
[1:07:03] presence of
[1:07:06] God do you know there are many
[1:07:09] preachers who go to read other books and
[1:07:12] other stories and other fiction
[1:07:16] books in order to preach to
[1:07:20] people what is the problem you see they
[1:07:23] have a
[1:07:24] liberos beliers a true preacher will go
[1:07:28] into the presence of
[1:07:31] God to bring spiritual
[1:07:34] manner let me tell you we have been
[1:07:36] visited in our
[1:07:40] generation we have been given a super
[1:07:43] message for a super
[1:07:46] chch hallelujah amen this enter message
[1:07:50] is a super message for a super
[1:07:54] chart because we are going for a super
[1:07:58] flight it is eag food chicken can't
[1:08:02] understand
[1:08:03] it but some people are hands they are
[1:08:06] scratching scratching scratching but for
[1:08:09] us we are flying high and high and
[1:08:12] high high in
[1:08:13] Revelation we have no time to preach
[1:08:17] from CNN or to pre from
[1:08:20] Google amen let me tell you we have
[1:08:22] enough
[1:08:23] food amen
[1:08:26] oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the name
[1:08:29] of the Lord and these Great Men you know
[1:08:31] they they go to
[1:08:34] theology instead of staying in the
[1:08:36] presence of
[1:08:37] God and there still a
[1:08:40] leaper having a form of
[1:08:43] godliness but denying the power they
[1:08:46] own they influential
[1:08:49] speakers they are
[1:08:52] forceful but still never knows what it
[1:08:55] it is to be born
[1:08:59] again not only
[1:09:01] pict even
[1:09:04] musicians someone can be so
[1:09:08] talented but he doesn't know what it
[1:09:11] means to be born
[1:09:13] again you are a
[1:09:16] leaper you have not entered into that
[1:09:19] presence to believe they have never
[1:09:22] believed in the Supernatural
[1:09:25] and they cannot understand
[1:09:28] it except they come into the kingdom of
[1:09:34] God he will explain it away through
[1:09:36] reasonings every
[1:09:39] time let me tell you brother give me the
[1:09:43] word don't give me
[1:09:45] reasoning there are many people who have
[1:09:47] come to this
[1:09:49] message and they reason
[1:09:51] everything whatever the message says
[1:09:55] it away I don't want to reason the world
[1:09:59] I want to believe every part of the
[1:10:02] world without reasoning
[1:10:05] it for he's never lived this man he has
[1:10:09] never lived in this
[1:10:13] atmosphere but a
[1:10:15] man this moved my heart ever comes in
[1:10:21] there he has to become a son and
[1:10:24] daughter of God
[1:10:28] then his nature is like
[1:10:31] God who believes the
[1:10:36] supernatural do we believe in the
[1:10:39] Supernatural now let me tell you a
[1:10:41] little bit about the
[1:10:43] supernatural the supernatural power of
[1:10:48] God happens by Divine
[1:10:52] unction no man controls it
[1:10:56] only the word
[1:10:57] does faith faith in the
[1:11:01] word a true Prophet minister of the of
[1:11:04] the Lord will always bring a
[1:11:07] message that will Asher in the Pres
[1:11:10] people in the presence of
[1:11:13] God I was speaking with the minister
[1:11:15] down in the
[1:11:17] South and we both
[1:11:20] agreed that to know that someone
[1:11:23] preached a powerful sermon
[1:11:28] is when people entered into that
[1:11:32] presence this message is not some
[1:11:35] intellectual
[1:11:38] thing we did not believe the message to
[1:11:40] just
[1:11:43] understand we believed the
[1:11:45] message to enter into that divine
[1:11:49] presence to be ushered into that divine
[1:11:53] presence we thank God for the prophet
[1:11:56] Mal because his message has ushered us
[1:11:59] the Believers into that divine
[1:12:02] presence a place where the
[1:12:05] supernatural a place where the where the
[1:12:09] supernatural power of
[1:12:11] God becomes naturally
[1:12:17] natural I want you to think about it a
[1:12:20] place where any time you expect a
[1:12:22] miracle
[1:12:25] you've heard people who have said that
[1:12:28] money was
[1:12:30] created have you not heard about it some
[1:12:33] of you maybe are
[1:12:34] here amen others who said food was
[1:12:39] created I had no food and food was
[1:12:42] created now to you who is reasoning you
[1:12:45] can't understand
[1:12:48] it the prophet said you can't understand
[1:12:51] it if you have never entered into that
[1:12:53] place
[1:12:56] but to you who have ever entered
[1:12:58] there you know there is something
[1:13:02] Divine
[1:13:05] Supernatural that can just Open the Eyes
[1:13:07] of the
[1:13:09] blind that can make the L
[1:13:12] walk that can raise the dead that can
[1:13:15] change a
[1:13:17] sinner do you mean a sinner can
[1:13:20] change and completely
[1:13:23] convert a small worker can change and
[1:13:27] completely convert a prostitute can
[1:13:31] change and completely
[1:13:33] convert are you telling me these things
[1:13:35] are
[1:13:36] possible this is what happens when you
[1:13:40] enter into that
[1:13:42] presence when you enter into the
[1:13:44] presence amen something
[1:13:48] Supernatural happens and takes
[1:13:50] place this is what this enti message is
[1:13:56] the en message brother is not head
[1:14:00] knowledge we should cry for more
[1:14:05] Supernatural I'm saying we should Cay
[1:14:07] for
[1:14:08] it if we are seeing less of
[1:14:11] it oh I want to see more of
[1:14:14] it I want to see more of it can you
[1:14:18] imagine because many people have not
[1:14:21] changed they don't they can't believe or
[1:14:24] even conf that Jesus can
[1:14:29] change praise the name of the Lord but
[1:14:33] let me tell you something
[1:14:35] today if you're a Believer even before
[1:14:39] changing you have to begin
[1:14:41] confessing that Jesus
[1:14:44] changes when someone is a
[1:14:46] doubter and he comes and is reasoning
[1:14:49] with the word even if you have not yet
[1:14:53] changed do not stand with them because
[1:14:56] that is the seat of the
[1:15:01] SC stand in a place of a Believer stand
[1:15:06] in a place of someone who
[1:15:08] believes amen that God is able to
[1:15:12] change God is able to change a
[1:15:15] liar a liar your lying tongue can
[1:15:19] change your immoral you know ways can
[1:15:22] change
[1:15:25] Your Lust can
[1:15:26] die your pride can
[1:15:29] die do you believe what I'm saying
[1:15:32] today God can
[1:15:34] change that's the supernatural power we
[1:15:37] are talking
[1:15:39] about and you cannot experience
[1:15:42] it until you walk into that
[1:15:47] presence praise the name of the
[1:15:49] Lord and so n was a
[1:15:52] leaper but n was a great
[1:15:56] man you can be great you can be
[1:16:00] anointed but yet you are still a
[1:16:03] leer you can be a professed
[1:16:06] believer but yet still a
[1:16:09] leaper that is why never trust someone
[1:16:12] because they come to
[1:16:15] church no don't trust someone because
[1:16:18] they are called
[1:16:20] Believers many times those are even the
[1:16:23] worst
[1:16:26] a professed believer who has not walked
[1:16:28] into that presence is the worst to deal
[1:16:35] with he can shat he can kill he can do
[1:16:40] anything are you hearing me Church why
[1:16:43] because he has not entered into that
[1:16:46] presence why is he worse because he's in
[1:16:50] a place where God is doing the
[1:16:52] supernatural
[1:16:55] instead of changing is becoming darker
[1:16:57] and darker and
[1:17:00] darker but let me tell you Brethren I
[1:17:03] came into this message so I can be
[1:17:07] changed I am not going to
[1:17:09] rest until every evil In Me Is
[1:17:13] Dead until I see Christ revealed through
[1:17:16] my
[1:17:18] life until I see the life of
[1:17:22] Jesus Through My Life
[1:17:26] praise the name of the Lord we have many
[1:17:28] n in the
[1:17:29] message we have many n in the
[1:17:32] church they will borrow money from you
[1:17:34] they will never
[1:17:36] pay they will cheat you they will lie to
[1:17:39] you they will do anything to you as long
[1:17:42] as it benefits
[1:17:44] them rather the Bible says prove all
[1:17:49] things hold fast to that which is
[1:17:52] good you know you have to to have a
[1:17:54] spirit of
[1:17:56] discernment to know who is
[1:17:59] who not because a brother is saying God
[1:18:02] bless
[1:18:02] you then this one is a very good brother
[1:18:06] see his
[1:18:07] life as he walked into that divine
[1:18:10] presence is he CH it doesn't matter
[1:18:14] whose son he
[1:18:15] is it doesn't matter whose daughter she
[1:18:18] is listen many times even pastor's
[1:18:22] children are the worst
[1:18:25] I am a pastor so I can say it
[1:18:29] boldly many many times Pastor children
[1:18:32] are the
[1:18:33] was they have never changed they have
[1:18:37] never walked into that
[1:18:38] presence so don't trust
[1:18:41] somebody because they are called
[1:18:44] Believers rather find that person to
[1:18:48] deal with that has walked into the
[1:18:51] supernatural presence of God
[1:18:55] and you if you were bornn in a
[1:18:57] believer's
[1:18:59] home seek to walk into that
[1:19:03] presence amen don't presume you are in
[1:19:07] it walk into
[1:19:10] it if your life has not yet
[1:19:13] changed amen cry if you have to pray if
[1:19:17] you have to fast if you have to listen
[1:19:20] to the message if you have to do
[1:19:22] everything you can because anytime soon
[1:19:26] Jesus is coming back and all the
[1:19:29] preaching will be over and all the
[1:19:32] church will be over and all the singing
[1:19:34] will be over if you are not filled with
[1:19:37] the Holy Ghost if you are not changed
[1:19:40] you simply be
[1:19:43] aaper may God help me
[1:19:46] tonight may God help our
[1:19:49] children to walk into that presence
[1:19:54] and in verse two he says and the syrians
[1:19:58] had gone out by the companies by
[1:20:00] companies and had brought away captive
[1:20:03] out of the land of Israel a little maid
[1:20:06] and she waited on the on nam's wife and
[1:20:08] she said unto her mistress would God my
[1:20:11] Lord we the prophet that is in Samaria
[1:20:15] for he would uh would God my Lord were
[1:20:18] with the prophet that was in Samaria for
[1:20:20] he would recover him of his
[1:20:23] depressy now here
[1:20:25] you see these syrians are taken a a
[1:20:28] little little girl out of
[1:20:32] Israel and you know she was now like a
[1:20:36] little Maid like a little slave
[1:20:40] girl and so this
[1:20:43] girl you know she's just so
[1:20:47] amazing you know this girl had lived in
[1:20:51] that
[1:20:52] influence of the supernatural
[1:20:57] amen do you know
[1:20:59] Brethren that it doesn't matter how
[1:21:02] young someone
[1:21:05] is but if you are in a home if she grows
[1:21:07] in a
[1:21:09] home where the presence of God comes
[1:21:13] down she can never be the same
[1:21:16] again can we have a conversation with
[1:21:18] Believers
[1:21:20] tonight the Bible says raise up a child
[1:21:25] in the way you want him to
[1:21:27] grow when he when he grows in the way
[1:21:30] you want him to grow when he
[1:21:32] grows he shall never depart
[1:21:35] from how many believe that to be the
[1:21:38] truth now how come many Believers
[1:21:43] children are not
[1:21:46] Believers how come they have left that
[1:21:50] way how come they have departed from it
[1:21:54] I want to say to you especially the

[1:22:23] will take for your
[1:22:27] children you you I'm not talking about
[1:22:29] your parents I'm talking about you
[1:22:32] now you know the word you know the

[1:23:44] brother B I made up my
[1:23:46] mind many years ago that I will raise my
[1:23:51] children according to this message
[1:23:54] if I believe if this message is the
[1:23:57] truth then I should raise my family my
[1:24:00] children by
[1:24:04] it and he said I I I made up my
[1:24:07] mind he had four children that I will
[1:24:10] raise all of
[1:24:12] them in the fear of the Lord and they
[1:24:15] will never depart from and he said I

[1:31:20] go and I will send a letter unto the
[1:31:21] king of Israel and he departed and took
[1:31:23] with with him 10 talents of silver and

[1:33:06] Emperor he knew
[1:33:08] nothing about the birth of Jesus in The
[1:33:12] Stables he was born right there in the
[1:33:15] Stables but they knew nothing about it
[1:33:19] it took people who were humble
[1:33:21] enough now wait for this
[1:33:25] people who are humble enough to see the
[1:33:29] star you know to see the star you need
[1:33:32] to be
[1:33:34] humble and to understand you are blind
[1:33:37] until the star leads
[1:33:41] you and when they saw the
[1:33:43] star then they rejoice and followed the
[1:33:47] star and they start L them to
[1:33:51] Christ now I hear many people who say
[1:33:53] where I believe Christ I don't believe
[1:33:55] the message of
[1:33:57] brother they are blind and they can
[1:33:59] never see
[1:34:01] Christ because the message is leading
[1:34:04] you to
[1:34:06] Christ amen Christ was having our
[1:34:09] ministers Seven Stars in his right hand
[1:34:14] amen each star to each
[1:34:17] age and in our age we have a star
[1:34:20] brother and that star is prophet of our
[1:34:25] age and his message is leading us to
[1:34:31] Christ not the man himself but his

[1:43:01] sin and then the man comes and says no
[1:43:05] no no no forget
[1:43:08] bam Apostle Paul meant
[1:43:11] this which authority should we listen
[1:43:15] to you as my
[1:43:18] pastor or the prophet of the
[1:43:20] age the word comes to the
[1:43:24] pastor the word comes to a

[1:43:31] the final
[1:43:34] Authority on the on the on the
[1:43:36] revelation of the

[1:43:41] Authority in in revealing the Bible to
[1:43:45] us if we don't if we can't say
[1:43:48] that then we don't need
[1:43:51] him but this Bible has been here for
[1:43:54] hundreds and thousands of
[1:43:57] years but the people have become more
[1:44:00] confused see how many religions they
[1:44:03] have each of them has a quote from the
[1:44:06] Bible but when God sends a
[1:44:09] prophet he settles the
[1:44:13] matter the matter is
[1:44:16] settled the prophet is in the
[1:44:19] land and his message is thus sayth the
[1:44:22] Lord
