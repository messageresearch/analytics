[11:38] every word we speak
[11:41] every word that comes out of our mouth
[11:45] if it's not edifying
[11:48] we better not speak it out

[12:01] let the Lord come with some
[12:04] this one with testimony
[12:07] this amen Nina blessed with the name of

[25:01] is going to get worse
[25:04] if the world will stand another 50 years
[25:07] the whole world would be totally insane
[25:15] the prophet spoke these words in 1964.
