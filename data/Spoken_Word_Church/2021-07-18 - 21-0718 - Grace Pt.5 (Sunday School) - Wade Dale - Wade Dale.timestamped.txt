[0:05] sister ann and brother al willis
[0:06] watching in downstairs
[0:08] that is wonderful that's good so if you
[0:11] would we're going to start on
[0:13] continue on grace today i was going um
[0:16] finish this up anyway today on on grace
[0:19] grace and then we'll let
[0:22] under current situation let bob start
[0:24] doing sunday school
[0:26] next start next sunday and brother
[0:28] richard height will be with us next
[0:29] sunday
[0:30] to do our services but brother bob will
[0:32] be doing the sunday school class
[0:36] um in the morning so if you would let's
[0:38] start talking again about grace
[0:41] and i was thinking yesterday
[0:45] grace was only mentioned a few times in
[0:47] the old testament
[0:49] just very few times because according to
[0:52] man there was
[0:53] not any grace in the new in the old
[0:55] testament
[0:56] according to what they saw now there was
[0:59] grace all the way from that when adam
[1:01] did what he did and eve did what she did
[1:03] that we know there was grace way before
[1:06] but god gave him the law and then
[1:09] brother brown you know he preached the
[1:10] sermon
[1:11] taking law for they took law should have
[1:14] took grace but they took law they took
[1:15] the law
[1:16] and what did the law do the law
[1:18] condemned you the law put you in jail
[1:20] the law said
[1:21] if you do this don't do that if you were
[1:23] caught committing adultery
[1:24] you got stoned and you were killed there
[1:26] was no uh court of appeal
[1:29] there was no because the law said you
[1:31] know remember the guy that picked up
[1:32] sticks on
[1:33] on the sabbath just picked up sticks
[1:37] and they stoned him god said stone him
[1:39] he's he's
[1:40] he's doing something on the sabbath day
[1:42] so there wasn't a lot of grace to that
[1:45] but now we know what who brought grace
[1:47] jesus christ is the only person that can
[1:49] bring grace
[1:50] and have grace for the people so that's
[1:52] where we're gonna if you would let's
[1:53] look
[1:54] at the uh the two definitions
[1:58] of uh of grace number one in the hebrew
[2:00] lexicon
[2:01] it's favor or as i was saying last
[2:04] sunday
[2:06] now listen god is not a respecter of
[2:08] persons but he does have his favorites
[2:11] he has his favorites because he sees a
[2:14] bride
[2:16] that's going to do what he says so
[2:19] according to that we have found favor
[2:22] as we saw that noah found grace our
[2:25] favor
[2:26] in the eyes of the lord and we also know
[2:28] that the world you know the
[2:30] world calls it grace when you walk down
[2:32] the aisle gracefully and you're
[2:33] you're flowing and elegant and all that
[2:36] so
[2:37] we're not going to worry about that
[2:38] we're just going to worry about the one
[2:39] in the bible
[2:41] where it is favor and then we see that
[2:44] the definition of grace in the
[2:46] uh webster's dictionary is where brother
[2:48] branham talks about
[2:50] unmerited now look divine assistance
[2:55] because i don't care how perfect you are
[2:58] and how perfect i am
[3:01] you still have your favorites and you
[3:02] lean towards your favoritism you show
[3:04] favoritism i don't care it doesn't
[3:06] matter who you are
[3:07] all right just admit it we we do show
[3:11] favoritism and the way god shows
[3:13] favoritism though
[3:15] is by grace by grace he saw a group of
[3:18] people and by
[3:19] election or go back to for knowledge he
[3:22] knew that there would be a group of
[3:24] people
[3:25] that he was going to have to give grace
[3:26] for but they would stay under that
[3:28] that's why the prophet god says
[3:30] we are now misgrace amen
[3:33] if we stay under that then we are fine
[3:36] but if we get out from under that then
[3:37] we'll miss disgrace
[3:40] because there is disgrace that we're not
[3:42] going to talk about we
[3:43] going to talk about grace all right but
[3:45] it's unmerited
[3:46] so and i'm going to read the scripture
[3:47] here because there's always the
[3:49] contention or the warring of the
[3:52] james says it's by works and paul says
[3:54] it's by
[3:55] faith or by grace and then you know you
[3:58] look at
[3:58] and brother branham took a prophet come
[4:00] works is what
[4:02] faith expressed so he put both
[4:04] scriptures together
[4:06] and made it work made it just a
[4:08] beautiful picture works
[4:10] is faith expressed well that's what
[4:12] james was really trying to say he wasn't
[4:14] trying to say it's just by works
[4:16] and paul wasn't saying it's just by
[4:17] grace it's by both because
[4:19] under grace you will do you came to
[4:21] church this morning
[4:22] under grace amen you came to church
[4:26] under grace
[4:27] unmerited divine look assistance
[4:32] see in the old testament like the
[4:33] prophet of god said he said i thought
[4:34] jehovah
[4:36] hated me and god love or yeah all right
[4:39] and jesus loved me said
[4:40] found out they was the same people and
[4:43] what he was talking about is is they
[4:44] were under the law in the old testament
[4:46] but they were under grace in the new
[4:48] testament that we see now
[4:50] like i said before don't forget grace
[4:52] wasn't developed
[4:55] in the new testament grace was before
[4:57] the foundation of the world
[4:59] when god saw you and me down here doing
[5:03] what we're doing there had to be grace
[5:05] already there
[5:06] or we would have not made it to here's
[5:08] everybody got that
[5:10] we would not have made it here without
[5:12] grace
[5:14] that's why that god give a grace
[5:18] of marriage and divorce he give a grace
[5:21] not only
[5:21] of human marriage and divorce but
[5:25] spiritual marriage and divorce
[5:29] that you and i were married to the wrong
[5:30] person and then by grace
[5:34] we were married to christ but our old
[5:37] husband had to be dead we couldn't have
[5:38] a living husband or we couldn't be
[5:40] married to christ
[5:41] amen so unmerited divine assistance
[5:44] given to humans
[5:46] for their regeneration or sanctification
[5:49] i like this one a virtue coming from god
[5:51] so it didn't come from man like i said
[5:53] before
[5:55] as as close as we can get to being
[5:58] impartial we're still partial because we
[6:02] got family we got situations
[6:04] blood's thicker than water you know you
[6:06] go through all that things and you know
[6:08] my family before yours okay
[6:11] but we see though that under
[6:13] christianity though
[6:15] because of the brotherly kindness that
[6:17] we haven't got to because of brotherly
[6:18] kindness though you look at
[6:20] you've got to extend grace back just
[6:21] like jesus did that's right
[6:23] right regardless of what you think about
[6:27] who's your favorite preacher and who's
[6:29] your favorite person who's your favorite
[6:30] this
[6:31] if you're under brotherly kindness it's
[6:33] supposed to be just like this
[6:35] that's right right exactly right no big
[6:37] eyes no little use no i'm going to
[6:39] prefer this one over this one or that
[6:41] one over that one i was reading
[6:43] last night in the conduct order and
[6:44] doctrine book brother brown was talking
[6:46] about
[6:47] if you have a true pastor he's a he's a
[6:49] servant he's not a master or an overlord
[6:52] or
[6:53] or someone that beats you to death and
[6:54] you know brother dale's been a servant
[6:57] he's given his self amen
[7:01] he's give himself
[7:04] you know what so that you can make it
[7:06] right not so much that we can make it
[7:09] that you can make it right
[7:13] it's pretty profound see that's a true
[7:15] that's a true
[7:16] preacher that's a true servant not to
[7:18] put your you know let god put you up
[7:20] here
[7:20] right right if god puts you up here no
[7:22] man can take you down but you put
[7:24] yourself
[7:24] up here first person is going to take
[7:26] you down as god
[7:28] that's that's the first person that's
[7:30] going to take you down is god
[7:32] amen right right all right so
[7:35] let's get on with that because that's
[7:36] another another subject
[7:38] a state of sanctification enjoyed
[7:40] through divine see how many times it
[7:42] says divine
[7:44] so it has to come from god grace has to
[7:46] be developed from god
[7:47] is god and will always be god because
[7:50] look even when we leave here where does
[7:52] the grace go that we're here where does
[7:53] that grace go to
[7:55] it goes to the jews to take out 144
[7:58] 000 according to the bible not 150 or
[8:03] 244 000 according to the bible
[8:06] grace is extended to them and then grace
[8:08] leaves the earth
[8:09] we'll talk about that this afternoon
[8:11] because that's when the battle of
[8:12] armageddon happens
[8:13] it's when grace is gone from the earth
[8:15] there is no grace left
[8:17] even for the foolish virgin they're
[8:18] going to be given eternal life grace is
[8:20] going to be extended back
[8:22] or into the um to the i was i tell you
[8:25] what folks i was something was on
[8:28] youtube and it showed them
[8:30] it was mount carmel baptist church we
[8:32] were talk we've been talking about
[8:33] doctrines
[8:34] i'll stop here just a minute but it's
[8:35] mount carmel it's not the one down here
[8:37] i thought it was so i was going to see
[8:39] what the little pastor were talking
[8:40] about but it's mount carmel up here in
[8:41] denver's
[8:42] well this guy is preaching i'm talking
[8:45] about grace for us now
[8:47] because he's standing behind a pulpit
[8:48] he's a baptist preacher and he's talking
[8:50] about things that can be discussed and
[8:52] things that can't be discussed
[8:55] he said you cannot discus the trinity is
[8:58] not discussable
[9:00] it's a fact he went over here just like
[9:03] this
[9:04] he said now what he was talking about
[9:05] was speaking in tongues and the gifts he
[9:07] said those
[9:08] can be debatable that's what he said
[9:09] debatable
[9:11] he said in other words he looked did
[9:13] this right and he said
[9:14] it's not debatable every one of you are
[9:17] going to stand before the white throne
[9:18] judgment
[9:21] wow that's their doctrine that's what
[9:23] they're built i'm telling you
[9:24] i tell you this in the sermon brother
[9:26] they've been telling you for years
[9:28] just go listen that's exactly what they
[9:30] build their doctrine on
[9:32] they're gonna have to stand before the
[9:34] white grown judgment and give an account
[9:37] of everything he said right right that's
[9:39] right
[9:40] then he said now now the tongues and
[9:42] interpretations and prophets that's
[9:44] debatable
[9:45] but the trinity is not debatable and
[9:48] you got to go see what i mean
[9:52] not debatable maybe not to them
[9:56] but but to us see it's great grace grace
[9:58] grace grace give to us we know it's
[10:00] false
[10:01] we know it's not true there's no truth
[10:04] to what he's saying here
[10:05] and there's no truth to what he's saying
[10:07] here so
[10:08] i'm telling you that there's only the
[10:10] grace extended now listen
[10:12] there is grace for them maybe at the
[10:14] whites on judgment right
[10:16] but when he stands and denies the word
[10:18] of god
[10:20] what's he going to take to the white
[10:21] throne judgment
[10:24] lord lord have i not and see he even
[10:26] brought that scripture in talking about
[10:28] prophets
[10:28] he even read that exact scripture he
[10:30] said lord lord have i not
[10:32] prophesied have i not done these great
[10:34] mighty things he said depart for me i
[10:35] never knew you
[10:36] he even read that scripture itself
[10:42] grace folks grace
[10:46] it's grace to know this message of the
[10:48] hour not just
[10:49] know it but to live it it's grace
[10:53] and look approval right
[10:56] we have been approved noah was approved
[10:59] and found grace
[11:00] under the old testament moses found
[11:03] grace and god actually
[11:06] did what moses said moses said if you're
[11:09] gonna kill them you're gonna have to
[11:11] kill me
[11:12] amen portraying christ are
[11:15] part of grace but remember that was
[11:17] looking toward
[11:19] mr grace that was coming and then now
[11:21] that mr grace come jesus christ
[11:24] there is a misgrace
[11:27] which is us that's right because in
[11:29] zechariah 4 as
[11:30] as somebody was talking about the other
[11:32] night
[11:35] it's going to be double grace grace
[11:38] grace unto it because it's going to be
[11:39] grace
[11:40] listen it's grace that you got the new
[11:42] birth
[11:44] that god came to give you the new birth
[11:46] not the birth like they have out there
[11:48] but a new birth according to malachi 4
[11:51] according
[11:52] to luke 17 30 that we are born again
[11:55] the correct way through justification
[11:57] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[11:58] ghost amen
[12:00] that we know these things and this grace
[12:02] that's extended
[12:03] but not only that but we're talking
[12:05] about this afternoon which we talked
[12:07] before that malachi 4 does two things
[12:09] the second thing he does is we're going
[12:11] to reveal the seals
[12:12] which will give grace to this guy
[12:14] because listen
[12:17] without the grace on it i'm not
[12:19] preaching i'm saying
[12:22] grace grace to your soul
[12:26] it's one thing but the problem
[12:30] and the mystery that man that guy that
[12:33] was there mount carmel church
[12:35] i hope they're not listening i shouldn't
[12:37] have said that but
[12:39] look this has got to die
[12:43] this is so unholy this is
[12:46] it ain't gonna make it so we gotta get a
[12:49] brand new
[12:52] i guess when we stand before the white
[12:54] throne judgment they're gonna give it
[12:55] god's gonna give us a brand new one
[12:56] because this one was worthless
[12:58] you see what i mean now listen
[13:02] god didn't preach that sermon satan
[13:04] preached that sermon
[13:06] i'm just saying the way it is folks any
[13:09] false doctrine couldn't come from god
[13:12] so we know that we get grace for the
[13:14] soul and that we get grace for the soul
[13:16] even if we have to go by the way of the
[13:19] grave
[13:19] we're going to come up in this body made
[13:22] new full redemption
[13:26] full grace great he says what the
[13:28] headstone coming crying
[13:30] grace grace unto it zechariah 4 verse 7.
[13:33] oh great
[13:34] mountain what statue of a perfect man no
[13:36] man's ever retained to that
[13:38] with the full headstone with with christ
[13:41] coming and revealing the seals except
[13:42] this
[13:43] end time
[13:48] also we look trying to cut this short
[13:50] real quick
[13:52] let's go to john 1 verse 14.
[14:00] john 1 verse 14 we're going to skip down
[14:02] a few from proverbs and all that so john
[14:04] 1 14
[14:05] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[14:06] us we behold his glory the glory of the
[14:08] only begotten of the father
[14:10] look full of grace and truth
[14:14] john bear witness of him and cried
[14:15] saying this is he that whom i spake he
[14:17] that cometh to me is preferred before me
[14:19] for he was before me and of his fullness
[14:22] have all we received and grace
[14:25] for grace amen for the law was given by
[14:29] moses
[14:30] but grace and truth came by jesus christ
[14:32] now remember
[14:34] he christ came under the law to not
[14:37] eradicate or do away with the law but to
[14:39] make it what honorable
[14:42] jesus lived under the law even when we
[14:44] were talking about the book of luke
[14:45] the bible says jesus went to church
[14:48] such as the custom was that synagogue
[14:52] was open
[14:53] the word had to be in the synagogue
[14:55] right hey man he didn't he didn't uh
[14:58] you know he didn't say well bless god
[15:00] i'm god i don't have to go in there no
[15:03] he wanted to go i believe he was
[15:06] compelled to go
[15:08] because he had work to do but grace and
[15:11] truth came by jesus christ
[15:13] and we see now that truly ruth i'm
[15:15] trying to skip through and get to the
[15:16] last one ruth and esther
[15:18] we see grace but let's go all the way
[15:21] over to
[15:23] romans 3 verse 24.
[15:27] yeah okay that's fine just stay right
[15:28] there romans 4 15
[15:31] because the law worketh wrath for where
[15:33] no law is there is no transgression
[15:35] so the law had to be given for
[15:37] transgression because
[15:39] you would not know that you're an
[15:40] adulterer if they had not been a law
[15:42] saying you don't need to
[15:43] you don't need to have somebody else's
[15:45] wife
[15:48] and all the other things that the law
[15:49] was given but remember
[15:52] therefore it is of faith that it might
[15:56] be
[15:56] by grace to the end the promise might be
[16:00] sure to all the seed not to only that
[16:02] which is of the law
[16:03] but that also which is of the faith of
[16:05] abraham who is the father
[16:07] of us all let's go to romans 5 verse 19
[16:10] for as by one man's disobedience many
[16:12] were made sinners now who was that that
[16:14] was adam
[16:15] so by the obedience of one shall many be
[16:18] made righteous
[16:19] moreover the law entered that the
[16:21] offense might abound all right there had
[16:23] to be something to judge by
[16:27] all right right but remember you walk in
[16:30] and the judgment is done and you
[16:32] you they took you out and stoned you
[16:33] there was no there was no court of
[16:35] appeal
[16:37] you you had no court of appeal in the
[16:38] old testament you did
[16:40] you did the crime you did the time all
[16:42] right
[16:44] but look but where sin abounded grace
[16:47] did much more abound
[16:48] why that grace was already there
[16:52] before adam even did what he did or god
[16:55] would have had to kill
[16:56] adam and eve
[16:59] that's right all right but he saw
[17:04] himself and adam trying to save eve as
[17:06] much as he could
[17:09] we know adam couldn't save me but he
[17:10] tried
[17:13] grace did much more abound all right so
[17:15] you got sin
[17:16] and then you got grace grace is always
[17:19] above sin but listen
[17:21] you can't what happens with us i say
[17:24] us what happens with the world is they
[17:26] take and do it like this
[17:31] grace over sin they sin and try to get
[17:34] grace
[17:36] and that makes it disgrace
[17:39] because listen folks i'm telling you
[17:41] when you pray
[17:42] and you ask god to forgive you the
[17:44] prophet that god tells
[17:46] me and the bible tells me that's put in
[17:48] the sea of god's forgetfulness
[17:50] never to be remembered by god again
[17:53] whether the world remembers it whether
[17:55] your neighbor remembers it
[17:56] whether your family remembers it god
[17:59] cannot
[18:00] remember that because of grace
[18:05] because listen folks you and i got to
[18:06] come to a spot i thought
[18:08] in this message of the hour that the
[18:11] real you didn't do it anyway and you
[18:12] that's a revelation
[18:15] of grace that was extended before the
[18:17] foundation of the world not just when
[18:18] you got saved
[18:19] not when you just got on your knees and
[18:21] asked god to forgive you but it was
[18:22] covered before the foundation of the
[18:24] world
[18:24] right amen but now let's don't make it
[18:26] disgrace and say well it doesn't matter
[18:28] then what i do because
[18:29] well you know what god saw you say that
[18:32] and you're under disgrace
[18:34] that as sin hath reigned unto death even
[18:37] so my grace reigned through
[18:39] righteousness look
[18:40] unto eternal life
[18:44] eternal life by jesus christ our lord
[18:45] we've been talking on eternal redemption
[18:48] and see grace is part of that eternal
[18:49] redemption so let's go to
[18:52] i've developed a cough look romans 11
[18:56] 5 says even so then at this present time
[18:59] also there's a remnant
[19:00] according to the election of grace
[19:04] and if by grace then is there's no more
[19:06] of works you're talking about here
[19:09] otherwise grace is no more grace
[19:12] remember
[19:12] do's and don'ts do's and don'ts won't
[19:15] get you into heaven
[19:16] right and i want us to see that we we've
[19:19] we've got a lot of new people coming in
[19:21] and a lot of people
[19:22] asking questions about the message of
[19:24] the hour and i don't want them to see
[19:26] that
[19:28] that we're living outside the bible i
[19:29] just want them to see that we're trying
[19:31] to live as close to the bible
[19:33] because my question to many people is
[19:37] they say well see they make excuse they
[19:38] say well that hair and address things in
[19:40] the old testament well no it's in the
[19:41] new too
[19:43] well so it's the ten commandments are
[19:44] you gonna take the ten commandments out
[19:45] of the oh no we love those ten
[19:47] commandments but now that wearing the
[19:48] garment playing the man that's just old
[19:49] testament
[19:50] when i want to ask them i want to say
[19:52] look who told you you could do what you
[19:55] do
[19:56] because it wasn't the bible
[20:00] right who told you sisters you could cut
[20:02] your hair had to be a man standing in a
[20:04] pulpit
[20:07] disgracing the word of god now brother
[20:10] brown said what was it the weakness of
[20:12] the pulpit
[20:13] it's what allowed those people to do
[20:15] what they did it allowed those
[20:16] pentecostal people
[20:18] right amen
[20:21] so it is of works that we do after grace
[20:24] once i see grace
[20:28] i don't want long hair i don't want to
[20:29] drink a beer i don't want to smoke a
[20:31] well i don't want to smoke cigarettes i
[20:32] want to come to church i want to do
[20:34] these things
[20:35] and you look at me and you say well
[20:38] that's just words
[20:39] it's not works when it comes from the
[20:40] heart that's right
[20:42] amen because i'll promise you if you
[20:45] don't have the new birth on down the
[20:47] line just like we're seeing now they're
[20:49] going to drop off like flies
[20:52] because there's nothing to hold them
[20:53] because you can't continue by words look
[20:55] at the catholic church they built
[20:57] everything they got on works
[21:01] and look what it's getting them nothing
[21:05] they're called the mother of in
[21:07] the bible
[21:08] but if it be of works then there's no
[21:10] more grace
[21:11] doesn't understand what paul's saying if
[21:13] it by grace then it is no more works
[21:15] otherwise grace is no more grace what is
[21:18] grace grace is for what you did in your
[21:20] past that was wrong
[21:23] you're wrongful things no you don't you
[21:24] don't get grace for doing things right
[21:27] you get grace for doing things wrong
[21:29] amen
[21:31] and it's not for something you're going
[21:32] to do it's for something you already did
[21:35] right but if it be of works
[21:39] then it's no more grace
[21:42] if i live the ten commandments look at
[21:44] the rich young ruler he met grace
[21:45] himself and
[21:46] the rich young ruler said i've done
[21:48] every commandment since my birth
[21:51] that's right now by works he made it
[21:55] right but he didn't get grace because
[21:57] because grace was standing there and
[21:58] grace told him what to do and he didn't
[22:00] do it
[22:01] that one little thing he didn't do
[22:04] otherwise
[22:04] work is no more work what then
[22:08] israel has not obtained that which it
[22:10] seeketh for but the election has
[22:12] obtained it
[22:13] and the rest were blinded in other words
[22:15] the gentiles got it
[22:17] the jews were blinded by god
[22:21] now let's go to uh
[22:24] ephesians 2 verse 7 will be finished a
[22:26] couple of scriptures here
[22:27] then in the ages to come he might show
[22:29] the exceeding riches of his grace
[22:32] and his kindness toward us through
[22:35] christ jesus for by
[22:36] grace are you saved through faith
[22:40] you got to have faith
[22:44] because how you're going to get grace if
[22:45] you don't have faith
[22:48] because it's nothing tangible there's
[22:49] nothing that i can say okay i've bought
[22:51] your freedom here's your
[22:53] here's your key to freedom no it's by
[22:56] faith
[22:57] right right faith is unseen i'm sorry
[23:00] i don't have this turned on
[23:06] for my grace are you saved through faith
[23:08] and that not of yourself
[23:11] it is the gift of god and not that you
[23:12] were born under the right family and you
[23:14] were born in the right church and you
[23:16] watched the prophet and you you got you
[23:18] know they
[23:20] you got uh um dedicated by the prophet
[23:23] and
[23:24] you understand what it means so it's not
[23:25] of that it's not it works
[23:27] thank god because that wasn't there
[23:31] i could have been dedicated by brother
[23:32] brown he died in 65 i was born in safety
[23:34] that could have happened but it did not
[23:36] and most of you here didn't either not
[23:39] of works
[23:40] lest any man should boast all right so
[23:43] let's go to second timothy 1 verse 9
[23:46] who hath saved us and called us with a
[23:48] holy calling
[23:49] not according to our works
[23:52] listen you can't get good enough to be
[23:55] saved
[23:55] get saved and then god will make you
[23:57] good enough
[23:59] amen you do then you'll do your works
[24:03] afterwards in a work of love
[24:06] not a work of have to right right yeah
[24:09] see if you think this morning you had to
[24:11] get up come to church because brother
[24:12] way to preach against you if you didn't
[24:13] then you're
[24:14] you're in trouble you need a new birth
[24:16] that's right that's right
[24:21] because that would put it under works
[24:23] but according to his own purpose and
[24:26] grace
[24:26] which was given us what in christ before
[24:29] the world began there's your
[24:31] answer right there before the world
[24:34] became look
[24:35] but it's now made manifest it didn't
[24:37] stay in the
[24:38] mind of god it didn't stay in the
[24:39] beginning
[24:41] it unfolded itself down right here
[24:44] but now it's made manifest by the
[24:46] appearing of our savior jesus christ
[24:47] look who has to abolish death
[24:52] i thought that might make you happy and
[24:54] hath brought life and immortality to
[24:56] light what
[24:57] through the gospel let's go to hebrews 4
[25:00] 16 musicians get ready to come

[25:05] the throne of grace

[25:11] do all these things do's and don'ts to
[25:13] get into the holy of holies
