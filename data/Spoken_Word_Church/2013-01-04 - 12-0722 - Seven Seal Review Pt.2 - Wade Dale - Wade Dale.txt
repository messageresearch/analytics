========================================

Timo falling in love and Lincoln County we have to handle things oursel here so our technician is star well Stars hadn't hit him yet but he's distracted distracted that's right he distracted yeah he'll look up and stars will hit him in the head one day in reality he'll s himid going to be too late yeah it's too already too late I think he already been hit between I yeah I think so cupid has just shot about a dozen at him and hit him in all 12 so but that's okay you know what so did we at one time most of you were not born married that's for sure so so we were searching and God was putting us all together wasn't he so we could come down here to realize why we're here in this age Revelations chapter 6 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal I heard of were a voice of Thunder one of the beasts saying come and see now we know what Beast that was we're going to just kind of review a little bit from last week that Beast was what a lion all right and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer he went out as a what a white righteous church under the under the um leadership of Satan he started a church but under the leadership of God God had already started a church in Acts 2 and 38 right and that church was a was a white righteous church for their time they had all the scriptures lined up right of course there wasn't any scriptures for them to read except the Old Testament Scrolls because they were writing the scriptures for the New Testament they were writing the New Testament that's why it had to be a white righteous Church in the first age cuz your uh Church a messenger was Paul and Paul was commission to write 80% of the old of the New Testament after the New Birth there in in the book of Acts so he had to be spot on he had to be right he couldn't be wrong now there was partial things that he didn't understand because even there was things that Peter didn't understand that Paul preached right Peter says Paul this thing hard to be understood but there was a white righteous word went out well then what happened was Satan just pulled under that and started riding in a spiritual form a saying that like uh what brother Bob was what was the what was that guy's name arimus arimus onesimus yeah he um remember he started that Jesus wasn't God he was a light Stu well see that was back under um polycarp and all them that was back in in the time that this all was formulating and then it goes up to 300 you know 325 ad the n and counsil um I'm reading a little book now about that how the Constantine and some of the popes came up they were vicious and vile people they weren't they weren't wonderful popes some of the popes had so many bastard children till they made a choir out of them so I mean I thought a pope wasn't supposed to have a life so you know back in the early time but see it was a it was a saying people what do you think about this or what do you think about this or what do you think about this and then it was a crown was given brother R said that was the false prophet what happened was he become a man he become a puddle then they you can't put a crown on a spirit so you got a crown a man right so he crowned his Doctrine was crowned right cuz it come forth from the Pope but now also the white righteous Church went through the first church age truly the right church right white church and the lion was the lion of the tribe of Judah so that covers your first three ages Paul irenius and Martin Great Men of Faith Great Men of the word great men that knew that the scripture said that water baptism was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ knew that that the U that the right uh wording is is go not God in three persons but one God with three manifestations see how close it is right real close right but they went down another group come up they went down another group come up into the fourth age which is truly a horrible age but it had to fulfill scripture so but let's go back here and cover that we're covering justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in our life because see I just told you that was history what I just told you it was all history that was something done back in the past they lived their life they're dead and gone well God didn't just cut that off and throw it off somewhere and say well I'm done with that one they fulfill this I'm just going to do something else no he comes and shows us that even in in all this that we are coming to a state of justification to where our sins are chopped off and God is beginning to deal with us right even in a sa cuz see the person of Jesus Christ is not inside you in the new birth until the baptism of the Holy Ghost still got the devil in you when this happen right but there's you go to church and they begin to make sayings they begin to say you need to read acts 238 you need to see this you need what it was a saying all right so a saying goes out at your justification you need to be born again okay and here's where you need to start your journey right here justification your past sins are chopped off M you're still a sinner right you got to repent for tomorrow because that same devil that made you do it yesterday is going to make you do it tomorrow that's right but you've come to a position though in the in in the word that somebody's speaking the word is going forth when it spoke to you it begins to Quicken things in Scripture that you've never seen before even in justification all right see the Bible says you know all Mysteries and not have this you're nothing that's right Mysteries oh serpent seed and all that yeah you can know every bit of that and not have the Holy Ghost that's right cuz the devil knows it you think the devil thinks it was an apple you think the devil believes in three Gods when it was just him and and him right mhm but he doesn't know the Revelation behind all that all right you don't think the devil knows that we're supposed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he knows that right but he started a saying that moved over into this age where they started baptizing 606 ad they started they said that Jesus was the light substance of God and begin to baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and brother Brown said father Son and Holy Ghost come from the pits of Hell the baptism right come from the pits of hell what it's started down here you say what about Luther and Wesley that's the mystery God wined at that that was partial understanding that's all they can understand so they baptized in the name father son Holy Ghost and and God said all right it's already out there all right but we got to develop from that okay this has got to go into the ground but this has got to start bringing it back up all right in the ages so justification first seal read the first seal and read it not as a white um devil riding off and not all just read it and look at your justification it's a journey here stands a lamb and there goes a white horse rider in opposition well don't you think God was got sure say here stands the lamb but God was already riding through this church these three Church agents with the real word of God that's right cuz remember Satan is always a copycat he never comes up with anything original right cuz he can't create right if he can create it' be God that's the only thing he can't do he can't create but he can pervert and make it look so close it's not the devil out here and Satan back here no they're so close right that it cance the very deceive the very elect all right to but in justification you can be deceived yes you're still deceived until that unclean Spirit goes out because it's the same Spirit unclean all right but you got we got to see that now they were in their time they were righteous okay but see this first three ages they were pure they didn't have Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism to fight you know they had little sayings like the like the man would go out you know that Jesus was a like substance of God well you know what that devil that man died 2,000 years ago that man you just said but that devil is riding right on end of the end time right now with the River Jordan doctrines and all that junk like that all right so the Devils don't die they just move around take a little different form all right now let's go to number two second seal and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which was a what O say come and see and there went out another horse that was red same Rider different horse that was red and power was given look at all this power was given God allowed these things to happen power was given to him that set their own to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword other words it goes from a saying to a deed Doctrine pretty much evolving remember the church ages lap over so that the seals one ends and the other one begins but if you put them in the church ages they got to laugh over with the ages all right so coming out of this third age going over into the fourth age which was what the Dark Ages Columba all right there was an eroding of the word the Catholic Church takes over and physically kill 68 million Christians red blood physical blood they shed physical blood right it says here do what take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another so so-called Christians killing real Christians killing one another right excuse me and there was given unto him a great sword or a great word was given to him what he become a viker he become a uh right in here is where the evil real evil part of the popes began in other words like I said having prostitutes and doing all these these things and the the communion with the dead and all the all the uh novenas and and and and you know one of the Pope said it's better that we kill them in the name of Christianity than for them to die in what we're calling now protestantism but it wasn't called protestantism until somebody named Martin Luther protested the Catholic church that's why it's called Protestant all right so in this age it was nothing more than if you said you were a Christian you denied the Catholic faith you died so there was a physical red blood went out through that age and killed 68 million people and brother Rand says Untold billions by their Doctrine all right so the doctrine is what killed worse than the physical killing is the doctrine that the people hold because what does that Doctrine do it goes from one over into another one from one right over into another one then that one takes it and goes over into another and that one takes it that's what happened here they had the pure unadulterated word right right but it be began to be eroded by this this because people started accepting it oh it's white it's righteous it's pure it's holy they're trying to do you know don't read the Bible we'll we'll interpret it for you and we'll you know we'll tell you when when God speaks and we'll tell you when he doesn't speak that's what a pope is right that's right he's the biker he's the one that speaks for God all right now that white came over into red because the people didn't pay attention Their Eyes Were blinded that's why they call us the dark AG ages it was a dark time for the Christian because they could only say I believe in Jesus Christ I believe he's the son of God and I don't believe in paying penants or or novenas or or any of that stuff I don't believe in any of that cuz remember if you'll watch you know watch the movie Martin Luther cuz you're going to see the end of this age appear That's right in the in the movie cuz remember the priest goes out and he goes in that square and he puts up he said okay if you sinned you need to pay so many pence and if you did this you so and it's just like a checklist it's like a it's like going to a a restaurant and ordering what you need you know it's this and this and this well that's what he posted see the people started paying the novion for him to intercede but then Martin Luther comes along and says Hey cuz he did it he craw remember in the movie he crawled all over the ground he laid on those rocks he stuck his face in the dirt he cried out to God why he had had so much of this indoctrination in him right until he was God was getting it out of him but he as a human was struggling with it he was a priest he loved the Catholic church but he saw when he read that scripture and I believe the light shined on that said the just shall live by faith not Penance not no venience not an intercessor not a not a a saint you got to pray to not that was the Revelation he had he didn't have a revelation that son the Holy Ghost wasn't baptism he didn't have a revelation that that there was one true and living God he was trinitarian he believed the you know he believed what the Catholics has said but God winked at that part of the ignorance of the man but he took that one scripture and Martin Luther comes out and remember he comes out in that square and he says no he said the just shall live by faith alone he said not by Penance not by works and then he goes out and starts to preach all right so what was he doing he was breaking the spell of this red horse ride over the people because remember these things are going to continue riding on they're riding in this age today that's right white righteous people they think breed blood brother said if you kill a man's influence you kill the man all right then black and then we get to the pale but let's stay right here for a second and finish here all right which also all this we were talking about back in the in the ages this was the longest age and they endured through that age and when they endured through that age they come out into the black horse which is going to be number five and six in your church ages but let's step back in number two and see that what does red always represent cleansing sanctification there's always a red heer there's always a red atonement there's always blood there's always something red and that Sanctified the people right the blood of the animals bulls and goats Sanctified the people it didn't give them the Holy Ghost right it Sanctified them because the blood I mean the life in that blood of the animal couldn't go over into the human being had to have a Kinsman all right that's what we're talking about in Revelations 5 upstairs but right here is where the unclean Spirit goes out the unclean Spirit still unclean Spirit goes out of a man whatever you done you stop doing right here cursing drinking smoking gambling uh smoking all that they didn't go out here right God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel if you're not clean here he's not going to put this in you that's right ain't that the truth that's what brother R said I'm bring you 100 quotes but you ought to be able to quote them yourself that's right right here's where the unclean Spirit goes out that's right that's where I stopped on my junk right here so God could give me this and and then I didn't do this anymore cuz it had been what eradicated red through red red his his covering his atonement through my red Sin makes a white sheet of paper that's just preach my sermon this afternoon all right sanctification is when the unclean Spirit goes out walketh in dry places seeketh rest and findeth none that dude's going to come back and bring seven religious just Devils with him not seven times drunk and you going to be a seven time worse drunk no you going to come church and right here is when your name goes on the book as a Believer that's what the prophet said your name goes on the book is a Believer at sanctification you have entered into a religious order well that's what they did in the Catholic Church they went into a religious order right all right so they went into that religious order riding this red horse which was false but now these people that gave their life for God they were Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost for their age because that's the age that they live in that's what they accepted that's right we're not going to be that that's true the unclean Spirit went out of them and God comes in cuz if God doesn't come in right here he's just going to make you a religious devil all he's going to do all right but you know what somewhere it's going to manifest itself somewhere doesn't matter if it's now or 10 years from now or 2 years from now if you're just Sanctified somewhere you're either going to fall off the wagon or you're going to get born again one of the table all right cuz you can't stay right here if you stay right here guess what them seven buddies is going to make you feel at home that's true right that's right you going to sit right here and you're going to do what you're going to die spiritually not physically you going to die spiritually and that's going to be the worst Bible says she's dead while she liveth all right and that's the worst thing to have right here all right so Sanctified life that means everything goes out its sanctification and then if you fill it with the Holy Ghost then all that's gone I think we were talking about the other day you know I used to chew the back and and and dip snuff and stuff and you know it never bothered me never bothered me at all after after God took all that away from me they never B bothered me until just a few weeks ago somebody walked by smoking a cigarette and I hated them didn't I I hated cigarettes and I walked by and somebody a customer or something was smoking out th on it that smell pretty good but you know what cut the thing off walk on didn't want to didn't even it wasn't a desire but it was this old guy right here that's right that's right this old guy right here he was moving up just a little bit remember I told you I was going to say that touch word and and I believe at that time I was already filled with the Holy Ghost but there's times when you but God hit me me right here in the chest I believe the Holy Spirit went and I went you know just blowed a bunch of air out well that's all it was to begin with just a bunch of air but you know what if if you're truly Sanctified God will God will fill you with the Holy Ghost if you're truly Sanctified because you're cleaned and set aside for service not put in service see not put in service you set aside for service all right so there's your first two ages that we reviewed now let's go to three and four and then we'll probably jump into them real quick and then next Sunday uh we will back up and do just what we did just just now cuz I want to it's been three or four months I want you to get your mind back involved with the seals all right and then dad's fixing to start on them upstairs so you ought to be able to enter right in I like that kind of I like that kind of message and I like that kind of teaching and that kind of sermons I don't like the shotgun pastors shouldn't be shotguns I mean surely they got to direct to an issue sometime they got to go over here and get an issue and bring it over here but most of the time they need to be plowing right down through you know right down through and you can follow that's right you can follow everything that they're saying and you don't have to wonder well what's he saying over here now he's plowing right down the middle of the field now but like I said you have to pull over sometimes cuz you know you guys you guys operate to GI if there something in your life needs to be taken care of he'll pull it over here and but now he'll always come back and go down you know he always come back and go there's a visitor upstairs you watch dad today he'll he'll pull over here a little while and then he'll jump right back over here and go right right back down the line again so third age the third age or the third seal is age number five and six which is Luther and Wesley and and they were a man all right so let's read and when he had opened the third seal I heard the Beast say come and see all right what Beast was that man intelligence all right this is when everything happened this when everything exploded printing presses uh Transportation all that stuff was you know was coming in the intelligence of man they were coming out of the Dark Ages or if you want two kids in school we we heard it as Medieval Times m e i d e v i l medieval medieval time you know when he had the kns and all that's what we were coming out of right here coming out of the crossbags you know Constantine had this vision of a cross and he won all these battles well you know what that's what I was telling somebody the other day Satan is so close you can say well God answers my prayers God answers the prostitute's prayer so don't ever say I'm right because right don't ever say I'm right because no if your life's wrong your life's wrong period but don't say well I must be right because God God answer prostitutes Ain that what brother Brown said yes prostitute come across a platform she'll get her healing Christian won't get hers cuz she got all these things running around in their mind prostitute just walks up in says I believe what that man says and God says okay I'll take her faith right so let's don't let's don't get you know let's don't and I'm telling you this is very important because this is the this is the terrible place to stay is in sanctification cuz Satan will feel you so much full of himself till you'll think you're God and you're really not but somewhere down the line it will manifest itself all right but just be careful I have never put my experience on that God answered my prayer because of this right okay cuz remember the Bible says in Malachi 3 that if you'll pay your ti God will pour out a blessing you can't contain now he didn't say if you're my child or if you're a Christian I never depended on any of that external stuff to say I'm right the reason I'm right is is because what is in here Compares with that right not just degrees compares to it all right now the third state the third seal and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld in l a black horse and he that set on him had a pet balances in his hand and Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny say thou not hurt the oil and wine now remember brother ran went through that that's when that's kind of lapping back over cuz they see they're still charging from novans they never stopped that because Luther protested it they never stopped charging for indulgences and charging for purgatory and charging they they prayed John Kennedy out of purgatory they don't tell how many millions of dollars that the Catholic Church gave I mean the Kennedy family gave the Catholic church cuz they knew it was a womanizer and all those things they knew he wasn't a Christian man but they prayed him out of purgatory so see this this horse remember this horse is still riding whatever this horse did back in this age he's still doing now right not dead that's right the only time death destroyed a little bit later on but right here we see it was a black horse it was the intelligence of man it was a man age Luther and Wesley they were coming out of the Dark Ages coming over into the fifth and sixth Church age and you see the characteristics we don't have time to go through the church ages but they surely compare they don't parallel with each other they compare with each other cuz see you got one two and three in the first seal four in the second seal five and six and the third seal and seven and the fourth seal you can't put the church ages in the seals five six and seven cuz the bride takes a Rapture right here there's no more bride in the fifth and sixth seventh SE got it right we're here we receive the revelation of it the spiritual part of it then we drop back and go on Rapture but see this is rapturing Faith for all believers whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life we're going to talk about that this afternoon cuz see I believe there's a book of books CU there's book inside the book right there's a lamp there's Eternal section but there's one section that's going to realize that this thing's going to be changed right here these people never got a body change they died in their group right right you say what about the Sabbath I thought we were at the end of the S Church age if we stay in sevens that's 49 77 49 we got to take a 50 brother BR preached us into eternity right in 1963 he began to preach his message which was at the End of the Age all right everybody understand that we should because it's been talked to you for years but the Rapture definitely takes place on the four seal all right that's what makes people crazy CU they say oh you got five six and seven remember all this is to the Jews cuz we're already gone right now we know this happens now this and this and this cuz we can see it going through the ages but five six and seven physically happens over there five whoever died is giving eternal life right six is when the two prophets come and they open up and they have earthquakes and this and that and the other right then the Seven Seals when Christ comes back to pick them up but remember this is the secret catching away nobody knows about this one this is the one everybody misses they missed this coming the one that's here now see it's like a thief in a night it's not in the Eastern Skies with a split M if you see that that means he's coming back there in the battle of armag actually to fight for Israel Gentiles are done away with so the Gentile age ends right here that's the seven Church age is that too fast for you we may drop back a little bit okay but you got to remember that's Gentiles yes but we get the spiritual part the Jews get the natural part all right anywhere in Revelations from 41 like daddy's talking about the bride goes up in 4:1 and she's not seen until revelation 19 but everything in between is exactly what you and I get as a spiritual walk until we do physically come R in Revelations 19 we'll read it this afternoon in Revelations 19 we physically come riding back with Jesus Christ in the Millennium on this Earth all this is already done everybody got that all right the Gentile Church age is over though when this age ends Gentile churches when the door of the Gentile age is closed God will anoint a church we're going to you be around for a little while but when God shuts the door that's it right got to hurry real quick so it's a black horse you say well how is this a type of the Holy Ghost and it's black well it means death right death that black horse means death it was charged in for things Penny see thou hurt not the oil and wine which is who you and I all right a black horse he had said only had a pair of balances in his hand you know know what happened with the natural but the black horse you got justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that's when you die you're dead you're exed out you're you are no more your own all right and then where is it at right here the intelligence of man that's where it's coming to the intelligence of man I said of man not of God it's intelligence of man because the intelligence of man they still baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost they still had trinitarian Doctrine they still thought it was an Apple so it was man's intelligence but God accepted that and said hey I've got to have that as a platform cuz like we'll see this afternoon like Dad made it today we got to realize that when that lamb takes a book in Revelations 5 there had to be seven Church ages already finished cuz it had seven horns and seven eyes so he couldn't take the book in the first age he couldn't take the book in the third age he couldn't take the book in the seventh age as we see that book being taken it's at the end of that age that's why taking the book is he's putting our names right so everybody's name wasn't in that book till after the Sabbath Church all three see was not in that book in the first second third fourth let's clarify that it was in the book it just wasn't made known cuz the book was written for the foundation of the world we got to get and we got to get away from God doing this yeah right it's when you're made known it's when you become the book right cuz we'll get into that this afternoon because the you know the the even the sayings of man says I can read you like a your life is an open then who are you you're a book all right we can't do the fourth one we'll do the fourth one next time we got to keep up with our time Lord bless you bless read the read the four still or just read well yeah read actually come back and read the first but read them all no really honestly read the four seal because that kind of culminates everything before
