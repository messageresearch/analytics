[16:16] times you know when we try to Fellowship
[16:18] together and we pray the Lord would give
[16:20] us good weather and good conditions and
[16:23] everything right Heavenly Father we
[16:26] thank you Lord because we know realize
[16:29] one thing without you there is no hopes
[16:31] of us whatsoever we would not be here
[16:34] there would be no problems we would just
[16:36] would not come be in existence without a
[16:38] Heavenly Father you created us you
[16:40] brought us for a purpose of one thing
[16:43] and that was to glorify you and may we
[16:45] do that this morning I mean this evening
[16:47] Lord in in the message of trying to
[16:50] glorify our father to speak about you
[16:54] but it's not talking about us none of
[16:56] the things we speak of has anything to
[16:59] do with us other than the recipient
[17:01] orever how we say it of that that we can
[17:04] enjoy the benefits of these things but
[17:07] Salvation is of the Lord and we believe
[17:10] you and we thank you just have your way
[17:12] now forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[17:15] unrighteousness and guide us in your
[17:17] grace and love in Jesus name amen amen 1
[17:21] Thessalonians
[17:26] 4 we'll begin verse 13
[17:30] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[17:32] Brethren concerning them which are
[17:33] asleep that you should that ye saw or
[17:37] not even as others which have no hope
[17:39] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[17:41] rose again even so them which also sleep
[17:45] in Jesus will God bring with
[17:48] him for this we say unto you by the word
[17:51] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[17:53] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[17:56] not prevent them which are asleep where
[17:58] the Lord himself shall descend from
[18:00] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[18:02] the Archangel and with the trumpet of
[18:04] God Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[18:06] shall rise first so let's read that this
[18:09] way for Jesus himself shall descend from
[18:13] heaven is that the way the prophet is
[18:16] explaining right and he does all three
[18:19] of these things so he's going to descend
[18:21] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[18:23] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[18:25] God and which is conjunction tying in
[18:29] together and the dead in Christ shall
[18:31] rise first then we which are alive and
[18:33] remain shall be caught up together with
[18:35] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[18:37] the hour and so shall we ever be with
[18:39] the Lord you may be seated and what did
[18:42] he say wherefore
[18:44] Comfort ye one
[18:46] another all right
[18:49] Comfort
[18:51] right
[18:54] now you think about
[18:57] comfort
[19:00] that you know it's a position
[19:04] of you know knowing relaxing or whatever
[19:08] you want to do or call it the word
[19:10] comfort and we Comfort one another with
[19:13] these
[19:14] words but now I'm honest because I've
[19:17] always tried to be that
[19:20] way when we used to read that and had it
[19:23] with a you know Lord descend from heaven
[19:26] with a shout and a great big holler and
[19:28] and
[19:29] and then we had a voice of an archangel
[19:31] something out of the sky come down on
[19:33] something and then a big to do do
[19:36] trumpet there wasn't much comfort in
[19:40] that you know cuz I didn't understand it
[19:43] did you but now since it's been
[19:47] explained then we can have at
[19:52] least um
[19:55] comforting uh you know thought right
[19:59] that it can take place amen you know
[20:04] it's it can be real so then we're just
[20:07] not talking about something you know
[20:09] some idea or some
[20:11] thought but looking at the truth of the
[20:14] word
[20:16] now I've been speaking for quite a while
[20:19] and it's going to be odd when you see
[20:20] this in a minute to tie into something
[20:23] else and uh I pray that God will keep
[20:27] our thoughts in align to understand but
[20:30] we've been talking about the Rapture and
[20:33] we know the word rapture is not in the
[20:35] Bible That's caught up as we just read
[20:38] will be caught up all right and then the
[20:41] word caught up is it it's not meaning
[20:45] something of what we look at at looking
[20:48] at it as trying to get our thoughts in
[20:51] there but looking at it that it's a
[20:56] process and we covered it this morning
[20:58] morning we've been over and over
[20:59] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[21:01] in Christ
[21:02] Jesus I believe the moment you receive
[21:04] the new birth no matter what age you
[21:07] were in no matter where Luther Wesley
[21:09] who what age Pentecost or any of them
[21:12] that the minute they received that Holy
[21:14] Ghost that brought that soul up into a
[21:17] caught up condition Hallelujah it
[21:19] brought it up out of the world into a an
[21:22] eternal State for the soul you know in a
[21:26] position and it started
[21:29] the uh part of
[21:32] the going
[21:34] away right all right cuz we had to get
[21:37] the new birth before we could even start
[21:39] talking about going away you know and
[21:42] it's it's something to be able then to
[21:44] say well you know uh we have been in the
[21:50] Rapture from the time we received the
[21:52] new birth but we just didn't know that
[21:55] was what was taking
[21:57] place we we taught it as we believed and
[22:00] done the best we could but now we see
[22:03] that something has been going on you
[22:04] know amen it's not something way off or
[22:08] way back under or something it's
[22:10] something going on now amen I I like to
[22:14] be present tense you know and I like to
[22:17] be I'm prompt I'm doing you know I love
[22:20] to be on time and I like to know what's
[22:23] going on and you tell me to be at your
[22:25] house at 10:00 I'll be there at 10 till
[22:28] but that's just the way I am you know I
[22:31] I want everything because I I'm I'm just
[22:33] built that way well in the gospel I want
[22:36] to know what's going
[22:38] on right and and and you know I want to
[22:42] be not What's called the end thing of
[22:44] today of the young
[22:46] terminologies but I do want to be in on
[22:49] what God is doing you know and be a part
[22:52] of it and all but as I said now from the
[22:56] time we receive the new birth
[23:00] that it starts us into a caught up
[23:03] condition and that will continue until
[23:06] we are totally caught up and taken out
[23:10] of this world and that's what we talk
[23:12] about a
[23:14] Rapture amen which you can see then that
[23:16] I'm talking about something in
[23:19] process you know something that's been
[23:20] going on Amen all right we we read that
[23:25] the Lord would descend from heaven with
[23:27] a shout now I didn't bring all these cuz
[23:29] we read them over time enough that we
[23:32] know the shout is the
[23:33] message that was brought forth but I
[23:36] would like to read you uh this one I
[23:39] like to look at other translations
[23:41] sometime and see what they're saying to
[23:43] see if they can hold a point you know
[23:46] and the JB
[23:48] rotham uh new
[23:50] translation says this in
[23:54] Thessalonians because the Lord himself
[23:58] with a word of
[24:00] command with a chief
[24:03] messenger voice and with the trumpet of
[24:07] God shall descend from heaven Hallelujah
[24:11] now is that close enough to what we see
[24:14] that the Lord himself shall descend from
[24:16] heaven with the shout the
[24:18] message all right now we've done enjoyed
[24:21] the message yes right yes you know all
[24:25] right then the voice of the Ark Angel is
[24:28] the same one that raised the dead back
[24:31] there the prophet said the same Lord
[24:33] Jesus so then he's going to be here to
[24:37] raise the dead in the end time but not
[24:39] in a physical Corporal
[24:42] body CU we meet that in the a going
[24:44] toward the Millennium right but we'll
[24:47] read in a minute where he said he will
[24:49] become visible among us and we'll raise
[24:52] the dead and go into Rapture visible
[24:55] what as brother dick said a while ago
[24:56] then when you when you see would be
[24:59] standing here and the doors open
[25:01] and 3 or 4 hundred people come running
[25:03] through the doors everybody in here is
[25:05] going to know
[25:06] it but if no door opens and nothing
[25:09] happens and and you just look and you
[25:13] see somebody standing
[25:15] there then you're going to realize
[25:17] something is taking
[25:18] place but everybody's not going to
[25:20] realize it right you know because
[25:22] they're not
[25:24] prepared amen and if we haven't heard
[25:27] the shout
[25:28] there's no need of talking about the
[25:30] voice of the
[25:32] Archangel or anything about the Trump of
[25:35] God or the trumpet it says Trump there
[25:38] in the scripture but look at up it just
[25:39] means trumpet all right see
[25:44] then as we'll read in just a second the
[25:47] prophet said Jesus does all
[25:49] three
[25:52] well then our part is
[25:56] what to to believe
[26:00] God except what he
[26:02] says and and depend on that and then not
[26:06] have to worry about anything else all
[26:09] right and see then that message that we
[26:12] have already
[26:13] heard right do you believe it's this
[26:17] message that we've heard you know the
[26:18] message that brother Brandon brought in
[26:19] the end time is that message am
[26:24] now I will not get to it now May later
[26:27] if I choose to pick it up but it does
[26:30] say there in the scripture at the
[26:31] light's
[26:32] Trump for the trumpet shall
[26:35] sound that does sound like two
[26:38] trumpets but that's not what it is right
[26:42] it's one trumpet but it's who's doing it
[26:47] and and the background for that if you
[26:49] go back to to when Joshua was going
[26:53] there and he was told to go around the
[26:54] walls of
[26:55] Jericho and uh he instructed the people
[26:59] with I'm just honest now it doesn't
[27:02] matter whether he did or not I'm just
[27:03] making a
[27:04] point it wasn't the voice of Jo of
[27:09] Joshua that brought the walls
[27:13] down it was when the
[27:16] people said the same thing Joshua said
[27:19] amen you read your Bible go around go
[27:23] around go around do all the things you
[27:24] do and then stop turn around to the wall
[27:26] and Shout
[27:29] right well see then God does allow
[27:33] things for you and
[27:34] I and there will be a people you say
[27:37] well brother Dale you was preaching this
[27:39] morning that that you was looking for a
[27:41] BL to come from Heaven I read what
[27:44] brother brandham said about it that's
[27:46] reason I believe it because he was a
[27:48] Vindicated Prophet but you know I
[27:50] believe it's been revealed to me and I
[27:52] can see it that not another messenger is
[27:56] going to come forth we've done her the
[27:58] message not another Prophet to come into
[28:00] being not somebody to raise up in this
[28:03] message and correct all of the wrongs
[28:06] the prophet has said and tell us the
[28:08] right and you know I don't believe in
[28:13] junk I believe that amen out of this
[28:20] message a people is going to
[28:23] come right yes sir who as we were bre
[28:26] reading this morning that will recognize
[28:29] who they are and what they're here
[28:32] for and then it's going to be them that
[28:37] speaks now anything else you want to put
[28:40] with that if you want to go into all of
[28:41] the days and the things that everybody's
[28:43] doing go right ahead just don't leave
[28:46] the bride
[28:48] out because I said about Eve this
[28:51] morning I believe she was brought into
[28:52] the world for the
[28:55] purpose that Adam would not necess
[28:57] necessarily had to sit out there and
[28:58] said let there be and there been no fall
[29:01] or anything it would have been Eve
[29:03] because she was chosen for that to bring
[29:05] forth whatever Adam and that's Bri that
[29:09] brings the
[29:10] bride I've defended the sisters because
[29:13] I've seen what this message has done
[29:16] it's been a wife beater message by 90%
[29:20] of what's in it and you know what I mean
[29:22] by wife beater you know they beat the
[29:25] women to death they don't never say
[29:26] anything about the man he struts you
[29:29] know he oh he's great something you know
[29:32] they beat the women to death well
[29:34] I'm I'm not a femish
[29:39] preacher I believe I'm just tough enough
[29:41] to forget all the rest and I do believe
[29:44] that we all have a part and I do believe
[29:48] that we are the bride of
[29:50] Christ amen and no matter whether it be
[29:53] men or women that's right it is the
[29:56] bride of Christ right because that's
[29:58] what we're chosen to be all right so I'm
[30:01] not looking for something else I'm
[30:03] looking at what we've got right so then
[30:07] before we start on into the part of the
[30:09] message I want to say the message is a
[30:12] shout right all right so the Lord
[30:17] descended and brought a message to you
[30:19] and
[30:20] I all right that message will bring
[30:26] Christ to Earth amen
[30:29] right all right then he will be the
[30:32] voice of the Archangel right that will
[30:36] raise the
[30:37] dead amen all right and then there'll be
[30:41] a
[30:42] trumpet and we'll deal more with that in
[30:44] this message today CU I hope you
[30:47] understand the voice of the Archangel
[30:49] without having to go into a lot about it
[30:52] if the voice of the Archangel was Christ
[30:53] back there and brother R said see it's
[30:56] the same loud voice
[30:58] that raised Lazarus all right that's who
[31:00] we're looking for right and looking for
[31:03] him to become visible Among
[31:06] Us and raise the
[31:08] dead because it's not you and I but we
[31:11] just happen to be the people that the
[31:14] end of all things has come upon am all
[31:17] right
[31:19] now so as we approach this point I want
[31:22] you to think
[31:23] about
[31:26] something
[31:27] we think of
[31:31] rapture as being caught
[31:35] up right now I just went through it so
[31:37] don't lose your
[31:40] mind when you get to New Birth you're
[31:42] caught up and you're being caught up
[31:44] okay that's fine that way but our
[31:46] thoughts is not just on that basis of a
[31:48] birth our thoughts has always been of a
[31:51] Rapture is going up you know going out
[31:56] cuz that's human terminologies all
[32:01] right but now if Jesus does all three of
[32:04] these in his
[32:06] descending why are we looking as much of
[32:09] going away as we're looking as what's
[32:12] taking place among
[32:18] us cuz you're going to be surprised that
[32:20] maybe another message
[32:22] later when we try to tie
[32:26] together
[32:28] caught
[32:29] up in the coming of the
[32:42] Lord you just you're just too too deep
[32:44] you're too just is any problem with the
[32:47] words I
[32:48] use I mean caught up and
[32:55] coming listen church if you can't get
[32:57] nothing else that I'm talking about get
[32:59] one
[33:00] thing I
[33:03] believe that the Rapture is already in a
[33:09] process and and a big portion of the
[33:13] things have already
[33:15] transpired that we would be looking for
[33:17] them to take
[33:20] place all right so now remember looking
[33:24] back we lose it looking forward we lose
[33:26] it amen let's just recognize what's
[33:30] taking place
[33:32] now and what God is doing Among Us
[33:34] that's
[33:37] right there is uh looking back can be a
[33:41] faith
[33:42] Builder but that's not Faith that's
[33:45] right that's a fact that's right right
[33:48] when you're looking back that's a fact
[33:50] it's already happened right now tomorrow
[33:52] is not
[33:54] here and remember when you get to
[33:57] tomorrow tomorrow becomes today right
[34:01] right so why worry about either end of
[34:06] it that's all I've ever tried to get you
[34:08] to see all of the time of ministry is to
[34:12] try to get us to see what's going on
[34:14] right now
[34:16] amen a God that's living revealing
[34:20] himself
[34:24] now and that ought bring something
[34:26] personal to that's right all right let's
[34:30] just read a little bit and then we'll
[34:32] we'll get our thoughts
[34:34] together so go ahead with number one
[34:37] Brothers it's taken from the Rapture
[34:39] message paragraph 129 130 through
[34:47] 131 and back into 130 you'll find it
[34:50] 1129 you'll find that he's saying uh the
[34:53] words used there's three things that
[34:56] happens before the Lord himself
[35:05] appears three things before he appears
[35:09] and well he just misunderstood you know
[35:12] may he he made a slip of the
[35:17] well there's three
[35:20] things there's three things that happens
[35:22] before the Lord himself appear quickly
[35:24] now so we can close the first thing
[35:27] notice the shout of voice and trumpet
[35:29] let's read it now and see it that's
[35:31] right the Lord himself 16th verse shall
[35:33] descend from heaven with a shout with
[35:35] the voice of the Archangel and the
[35:37] trumpet of
[35:38] God three things happens a voice a shout
[35:42] a voice a trumpet has to happen before
[35:45] Jesus appears now he still got the same
[35:47] thought come
[35:51] on
[35:53] right now to give you a key to go with
[35:56] it to remember in his coming there's a
[35:58] difference between the appearing of the
[36:00] Lord and the coming of the
[36:04] Lord what your Prophet
[36:07] said okay now hold on
[36:11] then say Jesus does all three of them
[36:14] when he he he he's descended the shout
[36:17] the shout it's the message going forth
[36:20] first the living bread of life bringing
[36:23] forth the bride all right
[36:25] now
[36:27] so then the first part or whatever you
[36:30] want to call
[36:32] it or the
[36:35] Rapture in the basis of what it is when
[36:39] it brings it was brought by the prophet
[36:43] it's already over right right y we're
[36:46] looking for something to happen and God
[36:49] saying it's done took
[36:52] place now right to make that right and
[36:55] correct in our
[36:57] human
[37:00] terminologies I've always been a type of
[37:02] person who believes in kind of like
[37:03] progressiveness and starting at an
[37:05] Earnest going to to a you know positive
[37:09] you know somebody just hears the message
[37:12] today well you can't expect them to say
[37:15] they know the message that's right so to
[37:19] them it's just beginning that's right
[37:21] amen that's why it says in the days d a
[37:25] y s it didn't say d a y d a y s days of
[37:31] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[37:35] shall begin to sound the mysteries of
[37:38] God should be finished right so that
[37:41] means
[37:44] days you know in other
[37:47] words to brother
[37:50] colie he heard of it in
[37:54] 71 okay sister Trudy maybe you heard of
[37:59] it in what 855 90 when she first heard
[38:03] of the
[38:03] message all right see he's heard of the
[38:06] message a long time before she
[38:09] is but it's the same message is the same
[38:12] God so it's in the days of the voice all
[38:16] right so we're still in the days of the
[38:18] voice the m just still going around the
[38:20] world and people are receiving the
[38:23] message right all right so they're It's
[38:26] Beginning so it's a process that's right
[38:30] all right but Jesus does all three in
[38:33] his
[38:37] descending now here's our words
[38:43] descending
[38:47] ascending we're still thinking Rapture
[38:50] is going
[38:54] up remember all three of these takes
[38:57] place before you go
[39:02] up
[39:04] well we better get our mind out of
[39:07] Heaven that's true and get down to
[39:11] earth amen what was that saying if I
[39:14] misquote it but it's close some people
[39:16] are too Heavenly minded to be of any
[39:18] Earthly good
[39:21] right some people are so Earthly minded
[39:23] they're no Heavenly good all right
[39:27] right you know everybody wants to
[39:30] spiritualize
[39:32] everything well it's
[39:34] good but you had never you was in the
[39:37] Baptist you know in the Baptist we
[39:39] preached that there was a great God who
[39:41] healed the sick and done this that and
[39:43] the
[39:43] other and when it come to the Blind Men
[39:46] you know
[39:48] man and the Lord prayed for him and his
[39:50] eyes was
[39:51] healed you know well we preach that is a
[39:55] spiritual happening
[40:00] well first all we didn't believe in
[40:01] Divine Healing
[40:03] but you know we preached that that was a
[40:07] spiritual
[40:09] happening and everybody is so happy that
[40:12] it was a spiritual we thought it was a
[40:16] physical well it was both of them if we
[40:20] did had it
[40:21] right it was a physical
[40:25] healing all right
[40:27] and then they could go on and receive
[40:28] the Holy Ghost to get their eyes
[40:31] opened but we got to get it all you know
[40:35] figured
[40:37] out and I know and realize one
[40:42] thing you can sit and listen to brother
[40:45] random every day of your
[40:51] life play the takes 24 hours a day and
[40:55] never
[40:58] turn them off never go to
[41:00] sleep and live 50 years and listen to
[41:04] Tes end of that you have a head
[41:07] full but there's no Revelation unless
[41:10] God's revealed
[41:13] it as I say in this morning we than the
[41:15] prophet said it it's revealed no quick
[41:18] as he spoke it it put it right back into
[41:20] a
[41:22] prophecy this message is still a
[41:24] prophecy until it's revealed to you and
[41:27] I all right
[41:30] now so in dealing with it should we be
[41:34] dealing with something going
[41:38] up or in how it comes
[41:48] down are we dealing with the going the
[41:51] way or the coming come on that's good
[41:54] well no we're dealing with going away
[41:56] brother Dale I'm sitting tired this
[41:58] whole world I don't to get out of here
[41:59] only way we can get out of here is for
[42:01] him to come down
[42:03] here that's right right that's right so
[42:07] then maybe were to get concerned about
[42:10] it all three of these things shout voice
[42:14] of an archangel Trum happens here on
[42:19] Earth all
[42:23] right Paul says that
[42:27] but he doesn't speak of he uses the word
[42:29] caught
[42:32] away but in his word caught away he says
[42:36] we're caught up to meet the Lord in the
[42:41] air
[42:43] now he doesn't bring out
[42:48] dire come on put it up there let's read
[42:51] it 1 Thessalonians
[42:53] 4:16-17 I want you to just read your
[42:55] Bible I like like to read the Bible I
[42:57] like for you to read the Bible so go
[43:00] ahead and pull up 1 Thessalonians 4 this
[43:03] should be number two when you notes in
[43:06] there the Lord himself shall descend
[43:08] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[43:09] of an archangel with the Trump of God
[43:12] and the dead in Christ shall rise
[43:16] first now so you got
[43:19] the things that to transpire in the dead
[43:24] raises right all right
[43:27] then we which are alive and remain shall
[43:29] be caught up together with them in the
[43:32] clouds that's
[43:34] good but there's a little word missing
[43:41] there all right go to 1 Corinthians
[43:44] 15 and let's read what Paul
[43:50] says behold I show you a
[43:53] mystery we shall not all sleep
[43:56] but we shall be
[43:58] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[44:00] an eye at the Li's Trump oh for the
[44:04] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[44:06] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[44:11] changed all right now we're coming
[44:16] into a situation of understanding
[44:20] something that maybe brother brandham
[44:22] wasn't dealing with it when he preached
[44:24] the message of the rapture
[44:29] in the bases that we think going
[44:37] up maybe he knew
[44:40] that going up wouldn't help us a
[44:45] lot but if God can come down here
[44:50] yes I know the first time I saw that and
[44:53] the prophet I heard him one day like
[44:54] this and he said
[44:56] he said Jehovah the Old Testament he
[44:58] said God back there he said in all the
[45:00] sin of Israel and all the bad that they
[45:02] were doing he said God busied himself
[45:05] like a father with his family I just
[45:07] cried I thought you mean God would love
[45:10] me enough to come down
[45:14] here the whole of the
[45:19] Bible the whole of the Bible the entire
[45:22] concept of the Bible all that you got is
[45:25] him coming here
[45:30] amen we ain't got to worry about it we
[45:32] just got to worry about getting him
[45:34] here
[45:38] sir and if it's right that the prophet
[45:41] would cover it we'll get to later that
[45:44] the coming of the Lord is the revealing
[45:45] of his word
[45:47] amen why are we still looking for some
[45:50] physicals or some forms or
[45:54] something instead of look looking what's
[45:56] taking place that's
[45:59] right so now Paul adds together with
[46:03] Thessalonians he gives you a
[46:06] key so now we read
[46:10] Thessalonians the Lord himself shall
[46:12] defend from heaven with the shout voice
[46:13] of an archangel and from
[46:16] God and we'll be caught
[46:20] up overlay Thessalonians Corinthians
[46:23] together and your thought and what do
[46:24] you see the Lord himself shall descend
[46:27] from heaven with the shout voice of an
[46:29] archangel Trump will be changed and
[46:33] caught
[46:36] up change is going to take place
[46:39] here because that's what he said it
[46:41] change a moment twinkle of an eye and
[46:43] then we'll go to meet the
[46:45] Lord I mean why can't we just sit down
[46:48] and simply think things out
[46:54] okay go one time time he's seemingly
[46:57] covered Heaven would shout voice trumpet
[47:00] and we're done
[47:02] gone the next time he's dealing with it
[47:06] and it seem like he's
[47:08] saying you know something's going to
[47:11] happen
[47:13] here we're going to be
[47:16] changed we got to be changed before we
[47:19] can be caught up or taken off the
[47:23] Earth so now you'll see what I'm do
[47:25] driving
[47:26] at I'm driving at one
[47:30] thing something takes place
[47:34] here everything takes place here and
[47:38] then we go
[47:40] there are you listening yes so then I'm
[47:44] not looking for some splitting of the
[47:49] skies in him
[47:53] coming I'm looking at the
[47:57] message already be in the shout right
[48:02] amen and that then Jesus has already
[48:06] descended now let me get this
[48:11] clear I'm not of that
[48:14] group that years ago used to preach that
[48:18] in
[48:19] 1963 the Lord
[48:24] came now I don't believe like they
[48:27] do I I believe the Lord came yeah okay
[48:31] but I believe he came on day of
[48:34] Pentecost I believe he came in the
[48:37] garden I believe he's been coming all
[48:40] along but there's no you won't get me
[48:42] tied up with that perusia and or paria
[48:46] as they say the word
[48:48] is I honestly believe in his
[48:51] presence but I don't want God standing
[48:54] right here beside of me
[48:56] thank you I want him inside of
[48:59] here he's standing right here he going
[49:02] to have to kill me for what I
[49:06] do and you too that's
[49:09] right it's all
[49:11] right you see I require I know I do I
[49:14] require that you
[49:17] think why not we were giv the brain
[49:20] that's right right but you know what a
[49:23] lot of people do they want to take them
[49:24] out like a BB in a car box and play with
[49:28] them you know what that means don't you
[49:30] bb in a car box some people shaking
[49:32] their head these people from foreign
[49:34] countries they don't know what we talk
[49:35] about a lot a BB in a car box couldn't
[49:37] you just hear
[49:39] it that's all it's doing put in a
[49:41] matchbox where you could realize and go
[49:43] Shak sh sh sh it's just rattle rattle
[49:45] rattle rattle rattle
[49:49] rattle cuz there ain't nothing to
[49:53] it but what about a god
[49:57] who would create a human
[50:00] being amen so perfect yes so wonderful
[50:08] yes so A beautiful
[50:13] Masterpiece and then come down here to
[50:15] live with
[50:18] us you know one of these days a future
[50:20] home is going to be
[50:24] where
[50:27] my understanding I thought it was coming
[50:29] down so maybe we need to get away from
[50:32] wanting to go up so
[50:35] much you know is to start realizing
[50:38] things are taking place down
[50:41] here you know that brother randam said
[50:43] about the change he said you just turn
[50:46] around
[50:48] and what he said them saints now was
[50:52] like 20 ft at a slant I don't know how
[50:54] to explain that
[50:56] I ain't a scientist but it's another
[51:00] dimension
[51:02] right see we can just turn around and be
[51:05] right here not in this
[51:09] garbage but you be here in a
[51:11] Utopia if you don't get nothing out when
[51:13] we get into the message of the coming of
[51:15] the Lord maybe that'll help
[51:18] us because my whole point for ever since
[51:22] I started in this message and begin to
[51:23] see what that Prophet was talking
[51:27] about it's talking about God coming
[51:34] here not us going
[51:39] there boy what you just being that old
[51:42] Baptist and I'm not throwing off on them
[51:43] it's just where I come
[51:44] from Bo one of these days these bodies
[51:48] God's going to give us a new one cuz he
[51:49] can't do nothing with this one he's
[51:51] going to give us a new body and then
[51:53] we're going to leave this world we're
[51:54] going up in the clouds and we're going
[51:55] to sit on the harps and play I mean sit
[51:58] on the clouds and play Harps you
[52:01] know well I never was no good at playing
[52:04] instruments I own a lot of them back
[52:06] here but I can't play one of
[52:10] them and I don't think a change of the
[52:12] body would make me be able to
[52:15] play I'm not interested in
[52:19] that and listen I know I made the
[52:22] statement years ago and I know that
[52:25] brother Dale I made the statement and I
[52:28] still believe
[52:30] it when I come in the message I looked
[52:32] at it you know as upwards as goings and
[52:35] whatever because that's what we believed
[52:37] in the Baptist but you know one
[52:39] day I stood right here and told you I
[52:42] said I'm not looking
[52:44] anymore to go to
[52:51] heaven for 40 something years I've not
[52:53] been trying to go to heaven
[52:58] I've been trying to get heaven to come
[53:00] here sir a lot of difference in
[53:04] it you know and I'm not a good old
[53:08] Jehovah Witness is we're going to be
[53:10] going along here today building cars and
[53:12] tomorrow God's going to come and we're
[53:13] going to be happy and everything's okay
[53:15] or be the same no not garbage can I'm
[53:19] just saying and I try to be
[53:21] sensible to think things over and let
[53:25] God reveal
[53:28] it we can talk about going to heaven all
[53:31] we want to I believe was brother Woodby
[53:34] I think was the one that said it
[53:36] in he said you know we got to have a
[53:38] little
[53:40] heaven to go to heaven on that's
[53:43] right if God don't come
[53:47] here if he don't come here then the
[53:50] Bible's
[53:53] wrong God I want you to show me in the
[53:55] Bible I'm open for women kids anybody to
[53:59] show me in the Bible where everything is
[54:00] going
[54:03] up well all it does to me it just turns
[54:05] right around and we're right back
[54:09] here you see but yet you're destroying
[54:12] all of my thoughts cuz mama told me one
[54:15] day we're going to sail through the sky
[54:23] yeah but listen
[54:29] if Jesus all does all three in his
[54:31] descending you know what that's his
[54:38] coming I don't ask you to amen it's a
[54:41] quiet congregation anyway around here
[54:44] because you
[54:45] know
[54:47] U as one brother said you know amen is a
[54:51] little nod he said if you really get
[54:53] happy it's
[55:00] it's hard to think when you're hollering
[55:02] amen that's right now I try to amen a
[55:05] lot because I amen what I
[55:09] believe but I amen here one day and
[55:12] about that time that brother
[55:14] went some of them come to me later and
[55:16] said you amen what he said I said no I
[55:19] didn't I said I amen what he had said
[55:23] not what he went on and said
[55:30] now but if Jesus does all three in his
[55:35] descending then the
[55:37] Rapture must be in some way connected to
[55:41] the coming of the
[55:47] [Music]
[55:49] Lord my point is we try to deal or talk
[55:52] about a Rapture or a going up
[55:56] when the prophet is talking about a
[56:03] descending I'm talking about Paul I'm
[56:05] talking about brother
[56:06] brandham if we believe the shout is the
[56:09] message as he says it is then that's
[56:12] taken place here and has already
[56:20] happened then the Lord coming
[56:23] here not as a physical
[56:29] returning but coming here in Bride
[56:32] form you know in his
[56:35] bride where's the voice of the Archangel
[56:38] going to
[56:48] be all
[56:49] right then if the
[56:52] trumpet as the prophet go CED in the
[56:55] Rapture
[56:57] message that Israel was
[57:00] gathered at the Feast of the
[57:03] trumpets the trumpet would sound and the
[57:05] people would
[57:10] gather he said well there's a lot more
[57:12] goes of that yes I'll agree because go
[57:14] on to the next
[57:16] quote that a trumpet denotes I don't
[57:20] mean on the message here they're getting
[57:22] ahead of me now
[57:27] see the Lord
[57:30] Jesus it's not like you and I think
[57:33] about it that's right of his
[57:38] coming it's not that a
[57:43] way
[57:44] it's the thing of it need to do we need
[57:47] to get down if you don't get nothing
[57:48] else and I'll try to get away from this
[57:50] is to get it's got to be
[57:53] somebody cuz connected to his
[57:57] coming if it's not a
[57:59] physical that's right you know if it's a
[58:04] physical we can understand he just
[58:05] stepped down on
[58:08] Earth but then your Prophet said he
[58:10] doesn't do that and the Bible says we
[58:12] meet him in the
[58:13] hour and the prophet said he don't set
[58:16] foot on Earth until the
[58:20] Millennium
[58:23] well and ident even the
[58:28] trumpet as a gathering of the children
[58:30] of Israel
[58:32] together it also means the
[58:36] announcing of a great
[58:40] person is a
[58:44] trumpet you remember when the king would
[58:48] go out right and they'd be a
[58:52] trumpet to announce the coming that's
[58:55] right of the great king listening to
[58:58] brother Brandon one day and I thought
[58:59] well that's true he said even if an
[59:05] actor was in the part of a
[59:08] play and said that trumpet sound he said
[59:10] that actor
[59:13] quit you remember
[59:15] that he said if he's selling his
[59:19] goods and he's just reaching out for his
[59:23] money
[59:26] we hard to put that
[59:28] today all right we said he's reaching
[59:31] out for his money and he said the
[59:34] trumpet sound that he bows to his knees
[59:37] well you know what happened
[59:40] today and you finally get down after you
[59:42] snatch the money
[59:44] out but that wasn't exactly what he was
[59:48] explaining he was showing the
[59:50] sincerity of the trumpet that's right
[59:53] you know what
[59:55] you get your head cut off we're not
[1:00:00] doing what they told you that's right
[1:00:04] very
[1:00:06] serious but
[1:00:14] listen if the shout is a
[1:00:19] message then was this brother bram's
[1:00:22] message or was it the message of the
[1:00:24] Lord
[1:00:25] come
[1:00:26] on or did he say the messenger in the
[1:00:28] Lord's message is that a
[1:00:32] scripture the messenger in the Lord's
[1:00:37] message see we want to make it R around
[1:00:39] his
[1:00:40] message that's fine because he brought
[1:00:42] it that's right and he gets honor for
[1:00:44] bringing it but it was not his message
[1:00:47] that's right it was the message of God
[1:00:50] hallelujah it was not the descending of
[1:00:53] William brandham come on
[1:00:56] brother it was the Lord Jesus amen using
[1:01:00] a man amen looking down out of the sky
[1:01:04] am I quoting it there in Arizona they
[1:01:06] talk about the people saying that that
[1:01:08] 63 the Lord
[1:01:13] descended but now they're said none of
[1:01:15] that ain't
[1:01:16] right wrong time and all this that and
[1:01:19] the
[1:01:22] other we see
[1:01:26] if God hadn't to come in the prophet on
[1:01:29] the Ohio River and declared what his
[1:01:32] message was going to be right do you
[1:01:35] think 63 would have been worth
[1:01:37] anything right and like I said the other
[1:01:40] day in the spoken words of Original Seed
[1:01:42] where brother brandham
[1:01:43] says Lord what can I do I got him out on
[1:01:46] a
[1:01:48] limb he said pick up your pen and write
[1:01:51] he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:01:54] fulfilled come
[1:01:55] on read spoken words reading of seed
[1:01:57] probably about 125 is a big
[1:02:02] book but think about
[1:02:05] it maybe we should quit trying to deal
[1:02:08] with going
[1:02:10] away and try to deal with what's taking
[1:02:14] place CU
[1:02:17] remember we have got to get to a
[1:02:20] place that these things can take place
[1:02:23] amen that's right all right
[1:02:28] okay before we go
[1:02:32] there we have to be right here
[1:02:36] amen and see then there's no uh can I
[1:02:39] quote the scripture without you going
[1:02:41] the wrong way Flesh and Blood shall not
[1:02:43] enter the kingdom come on
[1:02:47] amen that's
[1:02:50] that's but it doesn't mean that we won't
[1:02:52] be in flesh and be there that's nothing
[1:02:54] nothing to do with it that's right it's
[1:02:56] not Jesus when he said touch me because
[1:02:58] the spirit has not flesh and Bone he's
[1:03:01] not explaining that this his blood was
[1:03:03] laying off over here and this is over
[1:03:05] here he just telling you like it is all
[1:03:09] right but you see if Flesh and Blood
[1:03:12] shall not inherit the Kingdom then
[1:03:14] something going to have to happen here
[1:03:18] right before we go there that's
[1:03:21] right he said well I understand this
[1:03:24] brother well maybe the person next to
[1:03:26] you don't right right and I wouldn't go
[1:03:30] to sleep if I was you and think you
[1:03:31] already had it I might surprise
[1:03:34] you
[1:03:36] okay but look when the prophet made this
[1:03:39] statement go to Number Four Brothers
[1:03:42] when he made this
[1:03:44] statement and the first time I remember
[1:03:46] it it was really a shocking
[1:03:49] thing roll it on up it's off of the what
[1:03:52] was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:03:55] how long how long how much longer God's
[1:03:59] waiting on me and you right cat that
[1:04:03] right there the church is waiting on me
[1:04:06] and you adoption time when God can pour
[1:04:10] into us his fullness his power his
[1:04:13] resurrection amen Now where's the
[1:04:15] resurrection going to be then we want to
[1:04:17] talk about the power where's the
[1:04:20] resurrection that when the church in
[1:04:22] Christ be comes so close together till
[1:04:26] Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[1:04:29] raises the dead and we go into
[1:04:33] Rapture
[1:04:36] visible Among
[1:04:42] Us you're confusing me no no you're
[1:04:45] already confused I'm trying to get you
[1:04:47] straight in
[1:04:50] out well you talking about a coming and
[1:04:53] around talking about a going show me
[1:04:54] where he's talking about to
[1:04:56] going I'll ask
[1:05:03] you go and run around his message and
[1:05:05] see what he's talking about a
[1:05:08] going he's always talking about
[1:05:10] something here that's
[1:05:14] right obliged to come forth a refilling
[1:05:18] of the holy spirit
[1:05:21] amen that you worked in party
[1:05:25] said brother Dale are you expecting a
[1:05:27] refilling I sure
[1:05:31] am but you know what every day when he
[1:05:34] revealed that word to me I get a
[1:05:36] refilling amen that's why I'm happy this
[1:05:40] morning when I saying it I'm not sad and
[1:05:42] down and out I'm happy
[1:05:44] because right when I get down and out I
[1:05:47] know something's fixed in the open
[1:05:51] am I've learned that much
[1:05:54] why because the devil's trying to keep
[1:05:56] me right from believing it when it
[1:06:03] comes what you think brother then we
[1:06:05] going to get a refilling they got many
[1:06:07] fillings in the book of
[1:06:10] Acts
[1:06:12] amen those that already had the Holy
[1:06:15] Ghost many feelings only one new birth
[1:06:19] that's right but then when you drop to
[1:06:21] the pyramid and look at it
[1:06:25] virtue not you're being born again by
[1:06:29] The Incorruptible word of God so
[1:06:32] something's in process
[1:06:34] am church that that's all I've ever
[1:06:36] tried to
[1:06:37] say God doesn't do things just like we
[1:06:40] think
[1:06:42] it it's always a
[1:06:46] process I've always told you you can
[1:06:48] believe what you want to I'm just make a
[1:06:49] point but I'm trying to make a show you
[1:06:51] a
[1:06:53] process we think of them all them
[1:06:56] animals getting on the
[1:06:59] ark
[1:07:02] right I believe it I believe there two
[1:07:05] of each kind of every animal on the
[1:07:07] earth now there wasn't 49,000 different
[1:07:09] kind of dogs it was two dogs in the two
[1:07:12] dogs with everybody everything in two
[1:07:14] horses they was all the horses they went
[1:07:16] 99 different stages of horses that's
[1:07:18] right don't be silly that's
[1:07:22] right then get out up to think the
[1:07:24] Unicorn didn't make it cuz he didn't
[1:07:29] exist but you see I've told you my
[1:07:34] thoughts 120
[1:07:36] years Noah was
[1:07:40] preaching it took 120 years to get that
[1:07:43] now I don't know my
[1:07:45] continents right when I say Africa I
[1:07:48] mean Africa I don't know I don't know
[1:07:49] the continents I don't know who's
[1:07:51] connected to who but you don't there's a
[1:07:54] lot of water and there was then and land
[1:07:55] and but you just think about that old
[1:07:57] elephant say that elephant was 4,000
[1:08:01] miles
[1:08:03] away right so he was on the other side
[1:08:06] of the world see you think it was maybe
[1:08:08] together but it's all
[1:08:11] right you know what I think about and
[1:08:13] more elephant started
[1:08:17] moving he moved five miles and he died
[1:08:20] oh Lord he had a baby and it moved five
[1:08:23] more miles
[1:08:26] right you know what had a while that
[1:08:29] 4,000 miles done covered and there goes
[1:08:32] two elephants walking on the ark they
[1:08:34] started 120 years before that's right
[1:08:37] God getting them ready amen he doesn't
[1:08:40] do anything abruptly come
[1:08:43] on that's good he works on both ends
[1:08:46] amen that's
[1:08:48] right brother R said look what he had to
[1:08:50] do is he had to breed this to that to
[1:08:52] this to that this to that to get you
[1:08:53] here
[1:08:57] some of these days take your
[1:09:02] journey I was a sinner out in the world
[1:09:05] and one day I become a presbyterian oh
[1:09:08] Lord thank you Jesus and then I kept
[1:09:12] walking and I heard the message
[1:09:15] Hallelujah
[1:09:16] right you know God doesn't do like we do
[1:09:20] he don't worry about time he's not
[1:09:22] concerned
[1:09:24] and wor about 120 years get two animals
[1:09:26] on the
[1:09:28] ark I'm just trying to explain God
[1:09:32] right that God is Not So as we think it
[1:09:38] took him a long time to get all of you
[1:09:40] sitting here that's
[1:09:42] right right think about it he says
[1:09:45] waiting on you and I that's
[1:09:47] right okay put that in there I won't
[1:09:50] charge you for
[1:09:52] it what you he said he raised the dead
[1:09:55] and we go in
[1:09:59] Rapture because he's become
[1:10:01] visible among
[1:10:03] us all
[1:10:05] right so if he's visible Among
[1:10:08] Us it's him going to be raised the dead
[1:10:11] that's right see that's what everybody
[1:10:13] says you know I first come in the
[1:10:15] message let's go on that third pool one
[1:10:17] day I'll get that word and I'll just
[1:10:19] speak that
[1:10:21] word I'll just speak it it'll happen I
[1:10:24] said you got to get it first that's
[1:10:28] right what was wrong with that
[1:10:30] statement brother Dale don't understand
[1:10:33] we are in the message oh
[1:10:37] Lord but is the message in us come on
[1:10:45] brother so there any problem with the
[1:10:48] shout already being taken place
[1:10:52] no was the message you brother around
[1:10:55] Andro any problems with
[1:10:57] that is any problems then if that's
[1:11:00] taking place at divorce of the
[1:11:03] Archangel would be here with us
[1:11:09] yes yeah but I thought boy we I thought
[1:11:12] one of these days we going to that's
[1:11:13] what we we we see we we that was Eve's
[1:11:16] problem in the garden that's
[1:11:19] right and she just simply waited on God
[1:11:22] everything would have taken place there
[1:11:23] wouldn't have been no problem but she
[1:11:25] couldn't wait that's right she had to be
[1:11:27] so spiritual get it all figured
[1:11:35] out so then the voice of the
[1:11:40] Archangel if the shout is correct of the
[1:11:43] message and we've done receed the voice
[1:11:45] of the Archangel is
[1:11:47] here that's
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:56] it took
[1:12:00] God want to say 2,000 years
[1:12:05] almost to bring Israel to the promised
[1:12:08] land or maybe even
[1:12:12] more you know the whole time they was
[1:12:17] marching you know when Ezekiel Saw that
[1:12:19] wheel in the middle of the wheel and all
[1:12:21] of them animals running all he saw the
[1:12:23] travel of Israel we know he probably saw
[1:12:25] it down through the church ages too as
[1:12:28] they were being killed by this group of
[1:12:29] people they moved to another
[1:12:34] place God's tender hand of
[1:12:38] Love why didn't he just go down get back
[1:12:41] over
[1:12:45] there C 6 million Jews their
[1:12:50] lives just that along that we know of to
[1:12:53] get them back to the
[1:12:56] Homeland right
[1:13:01] right does that look like a loving God
[1:13:06] yes it took all that to get them
[1:13:09] back but you know what and your Prophet
[1:13:13] come along and preach the fifth seal
[1:13:16] message and he said n not ever Jew we
[1:13:19] said those people from Calvary down to
[1:13:23] this end
[1:13:24] time have been killed and run about all
[1:13:27] over but he said God's going to give
[1:13:29] them white
[1:13:32] robes amen
[1:13:36] right doing them a
[1:13:40] favor I know I think different than most
[1:13:43] people
[1:13:44] but I used to read the Bible and God
[1:13:47] would tell the children of Israel said
[1:13:49] go into them amorites them jebusites and
[1:13:52] all kind of sites and they he need say
[1:13:54] destroy every one of them men women and
[1:14:00] children I used to
[1:14:02] think okay Lord old people live young
[1:14:07] people's
[1:14:08] live but why them babies right that's
[1:14:13] right one day I heard the prophet say it
[1:14:15] like this he said all babies go to
[1:14:19] heaven
[1:14:21] right and I thought
[1:14:24] you
[1:14:26] know if it hadn't been for him doing
[1:14:28] that all them babies would have went to
[1:14:30] hell that's right he done them a favor
[1:14:34] but taking their
[1:14:35] life send them to
[1:14:37] Heaven you're a funny preacher I agree
[1:14:40] with you but I like it you know I like
[1:14:42] it this way I can at least stay in the
[1:14:45] Bible
[1:14:48] amen what would be the trouble then if
[1:14:52] we can believe that the
[1:14:54] shout was the
[1:14:55] message and the V of the course of the
[1:14:57] Archangel would be in the bride in the
[1:15:00] end time to call the dead but you might
[1:15:02] not believe that because you may believe
[1:15:04] in other terminologies but somewhere
[1:15:06] somebody's going to call the dead I
[1:15:08] believe that so whatever you believe you
[1:15:11] still got to put it that they're
[1:15:12] depending on
[1:15:14] somebody whether you want to make it
[1:15:16] just brother random coming back and
[1:15:17] doing it or where you want to make it to
[1:15:18] bride or whatever you still got to say
[1:15:20] there got to be somebody that's going to
[1:15:22] be used amen but you know what it won't
[1:15:25] be that
[1:15:26] somebody it' be Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ
[1:15:31] right all right what about the trumpet
[1:15:40] then what about the
[1:15:43] trumpet well we used to think that one
[1:15:46] day we'd
[1:15:48] hear you
[1:15:51] know we hear a trumpet
[1:15:58] but what about that trumpet let's just
[1:15:59] read a few quotes and then let you think
[1:16:02] about what's going on look at number
[1:16:07] five taking to Revelation chapter 4
[1:16:10] paragraph
[1:16:13] 159 when the Bible
[1:16:16] comes the word of God and every word of
[1:16:20] God is a
[1:16:21] trumpet every sound of the word is a
[1:16:25] trumpet the gospel
[1:16:31] trumpet the gospel
[1:16:37] trumpet what about
[1:16:40] it look at to patma Vision page
[1:16:45] 48 when a trumpet is blown it has an
[1:16:48] urgency about it it is like The Hurl of
[1:16:51] the king's messenger coming to the
[1:16:52] people
[1:16:53] he blows on a trumpet it is an urgent
[1:16:57] call the people gather to
[1:17:00] listen Israel was always assembled by
[1:17:04] the sounding of a trumpet something
[1:17:07] important is at hand listen to it know
[1:17:11] this voice had the same urgency of
[1:17:13] appeal as did the trumpet clear and
[1:17:15] strong it was startling and Awakening oh
[1:17:18] that we might hear the voice of God as a
[1:17:22] trumpet this day but it is the gospel
[1:17:24] trumpet sounding forth the word of
[1:17:27] Prophecy to make us aware and prepared
[1:17:31] for what is coming upon the Earth right
[1:17:35] amen a gospel
[1:17:41] trumpet go ahead to the next
[1:17:45] one the 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews
[1:17:51] preaching and uh 60 1211 the morning
[1:17:55] service are we which are alive and
[1:17:58] remain under the coming of the
[1:18:01] Lord down here shall not prevent or
[1:18:05] hinder Now where's that at is that first
[1:18:08] Thessalonians right that's what it is
[1:18:11] isn't
[1:18:13] it them precious ones that seal their
[1:18:16] blood seal their testimony with their
[1:18:19] blood not prevent or hinder those that
[1:18:22] are
[1:18:23] asleep for the trumpet will
[1:18:26] sound something will take
[1:18:29] place the gospel something will
[1:18:35] sound the announcing of
[1:18:39] his
[1:18:42] coming and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:18:44] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:18:46] shall be change that's putting
[1:18:48] Thessalonians and Corinthians
[1:18:51] together you understand what I done
[1:18:53] while IO right I said overlay them come
[1:18:56] on this scripture up here about sleep
[1:18:59] and all Lord himself s descending now
[1:19:01] he's down here talking about a change
[1:19:02] he's putting Thessalonians and
[1:19:05] Corinthians together
[1:19:08] amen but what's he saying gospel
[1:19:11] something will
[1:19:15] sound
[1:19:21] now he
[1:19:25] said the announcing of his
[1:19:32] coming he's putting Thessalonians and
[1:19:34] Corinthians together to talk about
[1:19:36] announcing of his
[1:19:41] coming well I I thought it going that
[1:19:45] way
[1:19:47] yeah we might order to talk about his
[1:19:51] coming
[1:19:56] but we think about a trumpet as what
[1:19:58] look at the next one which is the Feast
[1:20:00] of the trumpets
[1:20:02] 647 uh 19 the morning service 142 143 I
[1:20:08] notice the trumpet is to call together
[1:20:09] the people assemble themselves together
[1:20:12] for
[1:20:13] something sometime it
[1:20:15] announced an important person now he
[1:20:19] just said to one before that it was his
[1:20:22] coming
[1:20:25] right like in Joseph they sounded a
[1:20:27] trumpet and Joseph was appearing which
[1:20:29] is a symbol of the great
[1:20:33] trumpet right go to Feast of the
[1:20:35] trumpets and read the great
[1:20:38] trumpet that we speak of and get to
[1:20:40] after a while in Isaiah and when the
[1:20:43] Great trumpet sounds when that ins sign
[1:20:45] will be lifted up right up there and
[1:20:49] then there will come a time when the
[1:20:51] Great trumpet will be sounded
[1:20:53] and all the nations were gathered to
[1:20:56] Jerusalem that's when the Millennium
[1:20:59] starts the great
[1:21:02] trumpet so if the great trumpet is
[1:21:05] dealing with bringing Israel to the
[1:21:08] Millennium what about the
[1:21:11] trumpet it's going to bring you and I to
[1:21:14] a place of being
[1:21:20] changed see the coming of the Lord and
[1:21:23] the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:27] Christ has to be connected
[1:21:34] together look at number
[1:21:38] nine taking from why Christ PE paragraph
[1:21:43] 47 going all the way to the bottom of it
[1:21:45] you read in between keep on rolling it
[1:21:47] up cut it on
[1:21:49] down supposed to be marked there we go
[1:21:53] when we see a God who can take a cancer
[1:21:56] that's eat a man to a shadow and raise
[1:21:59] him up to a strong healthy man
[1:22:01] Hallelujah that order to give rapturing
[1:22:03] Faith to the people right that when that
[1:22:07] light flashes from the
[1:22:09] sky and the trumpet sounds the body of
[1:22:13] Christ will be quickly gathered together
[1:22:15] come
[1:22:17] on Chang in a moment and taken into the
[1:22:21] heavens yeah there's got to be something
[1:22:24] like that happened in our schools of
[1:22:27] theolog theology can never produce that
[1:22:31] yet they intellectually are all right
[1:22:33] but you got to meet that light you got
[1:22:36] to find something right on to the next
[1:22:40] one questions and answers
[1:22:44] 64 will the bride be gathered together
[1:22:47] in one place at the
[1:22:51] Rapture when will it be in the west
[1:22:55] nope don't have to be
[1:22:58] there yep or yeah the bride will be
[1:23:03] gathered together in one
[1:23:07] place now he just said in the west he
[1:23:10] said no now he's turning back around and
[1:23:12] said it's going to be gathered in one
[1:23:13] place come on where's that one place
[1:23:16] come on this is
[1:23:18] true but not
[1:23:20] until the resurrection
[1:23:26] that's right not until the resurrection
[1:23:29] by which are alive and remain to the
[1:23:31] coming of the Lord Ephesians first
[1:23:34] second but it's really first test on and
[1:23:35] it's the fourth
[1:23:36] chapter he was a human
[1:23:39] being I believe it is we which are alive
[1:23:42] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:23:43] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[1:23:46] are asleep universally for the trumpet
[1:23:49] of God shall sound and the dead in
[1:23:52] Christ shall rise and which and we shall
[1:23:54] be caught up together with them to meet
[1:23:57] the Lord in the hour therefore the bride
[1:23:59] will all be together when it go be
[1:24:03] together when it goes to meet the
[1:24:06] Lord we're going to be together when we
[1:24:08] go meet the
[1:24:11] Lord that's after the
[1:24:16] resurrection all right so if the voice
[1:24:17] of the Archangel raises the
[1:24:21] Dead
[1:24:24] don't you think there'll be a gospel
[1:24:30] trumpet like brother dick said while
[1:24:33] ago the do swing open and all you
[1:24:36] everybody know something went on when
[1:24:38] it's a secret
[1:24:41] thing but now how many times have I made
[1:24:44] this illustration and I'm going to make
[1:24:46] one more
[1:24:49] time you mean we see the dead raised
[1:24:52] Among
[1:24:56] Us and I call up brother Mark and I said
[1:24:59] brother
[1:25:00] Mark we seen the dead
[1:25:04] ra ain't that
[1:25:06] something he said well yeah I guess it
[1:25:09] is but I got to go sell some
[1:25:15] cars right and I called Brother Dean I
[1:25:19] said Brother Dean you know we've seen
[1:25:21] the Dead
[1:25:23] gra he said well that's good but but
[1:25:27] I've got to work on a
[1:25:30] tractor now I don't think that's exactly
[1:25:35] what's going to take
[1:25:39] place
[1:25:41] right when they say the Dead's raised
[1:25:43] Among Us I say who are they who' it look
[1:25:48] like we got pictures
[1:25:51] downstairs they let you know who these
[1:25:53] look like when they

[1:25:59] pictures down there about 20 best we can
[1:26:02] do I want to know what to look

[1:26:50] resurrection part of right we're going

[1:29:57] God's trying to tell us he's coming this
[1:30:00] way let's get our directions
[1:30:04] right and get what it's supposed to
[1:30:07] be the Lord will descend from heaven and
[1:30:10] he already has with the message in that
[1:30:13] message is the voice of the
[1:30:14] resurrection and the trumpet is to
[1:30:17] gather the people
[1:30:20] together the prophet said after the
[1:30:26] resurrection I'm looking forward to that
[1:30:28] time I don't know about

[1:30:43] difference I'm too far up the

[1:31:07] looking at it this
[1:31:10] way I'm trying to preach what your
[1:31:12] Prophet
[1:31:13] said he evidently was talking about the
[1:31:16] descending CU he's the one who said
[1:31:20] it
