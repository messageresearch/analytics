[0:00] fear and we have this outfit fixed we
[0:03] will head into the book of Romans again
[0:08] hope yet so far enjoying it roaming the
[0:10] second chapter of it it's good and then
[0:15] I'm gonna read in fact I got a long
[0:17] while let's read like the four first
[0:20] four verses you read them up here I'm
[0:23] gonna read the guideline okay you have
[0:26] to taking that look remember in Chapter
[0:31] 1 when we enter chapter 1 remember
[0:34] remember that man foot chapters in Paul
[0:37] just wrote a letter so he's continuing
[0:40] his thought of the before which was last
[0:48] Sunday we were talking about without
[0:50] understanding covenantbreakers without
[0:51] natural affection implacable unmerciful
[0:54] know what the judgment of God that they
[0:57] which commit such things are worthy of
[0:58] death not only do the same but have
[1:00] pleasure in them to do them I think our
[1:03] pleasure ended up now he's beginning
[1:05] this talk
[1:06] therefore thou art inexcusable o man
[1:09] okay so this is we start okay therefore
[1:12] thou art inexcusable o man thou who
[1:15] judges up for in 1000 other they'll
[1:20] condemn estai self since now the judge
[1:25] does practice the same thing verse 2
[1:32] then but we know that the sentence of
[1:35] God is according to truth unto those who
[1:38] practice such things and dust they'll
[1:42] think this oh man
[1:44] thou who judges those practicing such
[1:47] things and yet are doing this thing that
[1:50] thou shalt escape the sentence of God
[1:52] question mark
[1:53] barred us now despise the abundance of
[1:56] His goodness in for
[1:58] and patience being ignorant that this
[2:01] goodness of God entices thee to a
[2:04] Reformation select first for let's read
[2:12] it again as well ain't it
[2:14] our dust out despise the abundance of
[2:16] His goodness and forbearance and
[2:18] patience and being ignorant that this
[2:21] goodness of guarding tosses thee to a
[2:23] revelation alright so now let's go back
[2:26] and read therefore thou art it's
[2:29] inexcusable o man delivers whosoever
[2:31] thou art the judges for more in dumb
[2:34] judgest another thou condemn us thy self
[2:36] or thou that judgest doest the same
[2:38] thing now what's Paul talking about he
[2:44] sees a natural group of people doing
[2:47] these inexcusable things fornicators all
[2:51] that list before well what's he saying
[2:54] like I told you last Sunday we look at a
[3:00] two-fold thing because these people here
[3:05] are doing experiments he speaks in the
[3:07] government they have the same devil they
[3:12] don't have to touch they don't have to
[3:13] commit adultery or they don't have to be
[3:16] homosexual or anything like that but
[3:19] that demon what that demon does that
[3:21] demon causes you to do certain things
[3:25] burning your own lesson all those things
[3:28] that we'll do this before but what about
[3:30] talking about because remember I think
[3:33] if I go commit adultery against you not
[3:35] getting standing the book or some people
[3:36] did I can't stand in the pulpit and
[3:39] preach against adultery but now if I
[3:43] have a denominational spirit on me I've
[3:45] never touched a woman in my life that's
[3:46] why I said we don't realize folks this
[3:48] thing right here does not stand this
[3:50] flex light does not sin Jesus told them
[3:56] he said all you gotta do is look on a
[3:58] woman now nobody bad that's here that's
[4:01] not here cuz I'm sure the preachers
[4:04] not going never touch the wall Jesus did
[4:08] yeah but that same adulterer spirit that
[4:11] your that you won't accept me in other
[4:14] words he said you won't accept me
[4:16] because of your denominational ideas or
[4:18] your mmm Trinitarian concept or whatever
[4:21] you want to in it your false doctrine
[4:24] cuz remember false doctrine contrary to
[4:26] God is just like that whole list of
[4:28] people adulterers liars and all those
[4:30] things living right I mean you hit it
[4:34] it's just spirit because like I don't
[4:38] think I'm puttin this this week sermon
[4:40] even in the third seal and come at the
[4:42] black course it was the blackness of
[4:46] Cain we will talk about this afternoon
[4:48] it was the blackness of Cain that's what
[4:51] killed him right
[4:52] it was his doctrine it wasn't that he
[4:56] killed Abel it was his doctrine what the
[5:00] only God jay-z movies doctrine the
[5:02] problem with the game was he had no
[5:05] repentance just like watch this look the
[5:10] goodness of God led to speak to repent
[5:11] Cain never repented never repented okay
[5:16] but he would have repented I got the
[5:19] devil in it the ones first thing he done
[5:22] the worst thing Kane could have done was
[5:24] the last thing he did he went out from
[5:26] the presence of God so he showed his
[5:31] true colors we'll talk about that this
[5:33] afternoon but who long time the third
[5:34] single back to Genesis chapter 4 right
[5:38] so what's Paul saying he he's not
[5:41] judging me and listen we don't judge
[5:43] people you're not supposed to judging by
[5:47] remember the Bible says you guys
[5:48] whatever you do that'll be me to back to
[5:50] you we are judgmental people but we
[5:53] should not judge we should let God judge
[5:55] because what
[5:56] in verse 4 watch verse 4 in the emphatic
[6:00] die Glocke what our dust our despised
[6:04] the abundance of His goodness and
[6:07] forbearance and patience see God was
[6:09] patient with us dug for being with us
[6:11] amen and the problem with us is it is
[6:15] God for bearing with us but but we don't
[6:17] want to be forbearing with my head yeah
[6:20] we want that person to see it my way or
[6:22] the highway
[6:23] okay the consolation forbearance and
[6:29] patience being ignorant that this
[6:31] goodness of God incasa's the reclamation
[6:37] we always see my honey that's my but we
[6:41] are sure that the judgment of God see
[6:43] even if even it's mastered we don't like
[6:49] brother l said he don't he don't speak
[6:50] to your flesh that's the problem that's
[6:54] the problem that like I was covering
[6:56] last Sunday that's the problem the
[6:58] message when they first got started the
[7:00] message of the hour beat the flesh
[7:03] didn't do anything for the stove be the
[7:06] flesh beat you into submission
[7:12] instead to say it fifty years later it's
[7:15] still doing some of that and some people
[7:16] they think is their address yeah but if
[7:19] we would have ever got that group
[7:21] boarding in called them that's my
[7:24] brother Branson new versus the hilltop
[7:26] subject and people don't usually teach a
[7:28] lot just plain messy brother you got the
[7:30] sea then you come alive with you born
[7:31] again and you did you come Church don't
[7:33] you well know it half the time anymore
[7:37] so he can't say that okay so what if we
[7:47] count it therefore thou art inexcusable
[7:49] o man whosoever thou art that judges for
[7:56] wherein thou judgest another thou
[7:58] condemned as myself well now that judges
[8:01] same thing one more time sure as a
[8:06] minister and as the gift that we have we
[8:10] have to stand before the people and
[8:12] remind you of what God's already said we
[8:14] can't bring judgment it's already there
[8:19] you being judged but we're gonna read
[8:21] and just dumb may if we get everything
[8:24] go this is what we don't want
[8:33] and the original says works okay see but
[8:38] watch you know credit daddy's got not
[8:44] give it up but we are sure that the
[8:48] judgment of God is according to truth
[8:49] let God judge you but as we preach the
[8:52] word that should be the judge the
[8:55] conviction it's not me going that's like
[8:57] oh that was when we've seen it many
[8:58] times a preacher will go back to get
[9:02] somebody that's they don't want to come
[9:04] to the Oliver I don't agree with that
[9:06] even that's it makes it too full more
[9:08] child help brother I'll sit down all
[9:14] right so you can't go back then get them
[9:18] because the goodness of God leads to
[9:20] repentance you got to look and see that
[9:22] you are lost and God is bringing
[9:25] something to you
[9:27] that's good that's why the most
[9:30] illiterate person can receive the
[9:32] baptism of Holy Ghost he realizes the
[9:34] goodness of God he doesn't have to do
[9:36] the do's and don'ts
[9:38] okay because we'll read it maybe in them
[9:43] I think I haven't in the scripture with
[9:45] the third seal maybe not I would look at
[9:47] these come in yet today or last night
[9:48] but I may not have put it in there but
[9:54] I'm not judged by preacher I just told
[9:59] you that preacher can't judge you he
[10:02] just tells you what the words already
[10:03] say it he just said - what words already
[10:07] say it and then where does the
[10:08] conviction come it comes on you by what
[10:13] he said okay that's what Paul is saying
[10:20] he's saying man you always standing up
[10:22] Peter you inexcusable man so there's no
[10:26] excuse you inexcusable preachers are
[10:30] preaching a false doctrine just for the
[10:33] blackness of this a a blackness of that
[10:36] black horse rider is so bad because
[10:39] everybody will read
[10:40] this afternoon everybody thinks that
[10:42] their life is like but if the Bible says
[10:47] if your life be darkness how great is
[10:50] that darkness when you think it's like
[10:53] when you think you made the Christ and
[10:55] you're worshipping the devil that's the
[10:58] worst you can take I'm gonna be playing
[11:00] horse homosexual you can take them the
[11:04] most vile people in the world it's not
[11:07] as bad as that because that's a spirit
[11:10] anointing them to do that with their
[11:12] flesh but if you ever got that soul
[11:15] converted say oh it doesn't mean that
[11:18] all that goes away right you still
[11:21] remember youth they don't know when your
[11:22] body we bear the marks of sin right
[11:25] because of all of it but inside we're
[11:28] claiming member the one that they breath
[11:30] round pray for the drops you the
[11:32] prostitute
[11:33] Jude the drunk but God saved her what
[11:36] was her name
[11:39] Rosella Street prostitute drunk got
[11:43] saved or so now she's testifying now
[11:46] they don't render what she done right
[11:49] but if she is born again where you gonna
[11:53] put her
[11:57] she didn't do gender an assault our body
[12:03] did that's why we have down barriers in
[12:05] divorce when we make number that it's
[12:07] that something I believe in the third
[12:08] seals were rather round really saw the
[12:11] grace of marriage and divorce because
[12:13] your husband's gonna be dead black dead
[12:16] in order for you to marry cross all
[12:19] right so you gotta be like brother
[12:21] whoever brother once said you gonna be
[12:22] zeroed out all right
[12:25] but what's Paul talking about Paul
[12:28] talking about spirits I go back to that
[12:32] example where brother Branham discerned
[12:35] this guy walk and do them room that he
[12:38] was committing adultery he had an
[12:40] adulterous spirit my brother around
[12:42] listen brother Graham didn't see a
[12:43] vision if he installed vision even know
[12:45] what to do because he didn't ever seen
[12:47] the vision of him with another woman he
[12:49] just saw there was a spirit riding with
[12:52] that guy as he walked through the room
[12:55] okay he attacks this they'll do that
[12:58] well then brother branham remember he
[13:00] talks with him and he says he said I
[13:03] went on further loudly what God done God
[13:05] showed him the vision come see brother
[13:07] Branham was getting ready to judge by
[13:08] when he saw and I believe God said he's
[13:14] not committing adultery against his wife
[13:16] he's messing with organized religion and
[13:18] that is the same level that produces all
[13:21] these back here reprobate mind been
[13:28] righteousness fornicators wickedness
[13:29] covetousness full of envy murder debate
[13:31] deceit malignity whispers that's all
[13:37] done by spirit
[13:39] it's just manifested through your body
[13:42] okay Cain committed murder again stable
[13:50] when he did not take Abel's way of doing
[13:55] things which was God's Way because God
[13:59] was what pleased with that so there
[14:02] wasn't a there was a now remember the
[14:05] Holy Spirit
[14:05] went back there when I say Holy Spirit
[14:07] people didn't have the Holy Spirit but
[14:09] he did have an anointing of the
[14:11] spiritual part of him that God accepted
[14:14] what he accepted his channel of worship
[14:16] and he told Ganga feel worship like your
[14:19] brother
[14:20] you'll be fine what he came to Cain has
[14:24] spirit on him that wouldn't let him do
[14:26] that because we're going to look at the
[14:29] black of what was the blackness of Cain
[14:31] sure it was that it wasn't anyone out
[14:34] from the presence of God
[14:36] that's the manifestation but the whole
[14:41] problem was is that he accepted his way
[14:45] instead of God's way right and he was
[14:48] not repentant and he didn't have a
[14:49] sorrowful have acute lower heat this
[14:52] afternoon so Cain was more Cain was just
[14:56] like us he was more worried about his
[15:01] own self then he was he just killed Abel
[15:05] and he said God this is more not better
[15:11] so see what I mean what we need to do is
[15:15] that I think the thinking of this here
[15:19] it's the goodness of God that leads to
[15:21] repentance so if God can if if this
[15:26] person these people person can see God
[15:30] through you see our problem is as we go
[15:34] judging everybody else
[15:36] okay well then remember if we joined
[15:38] everybody else just me to run back to
[15:40] you the same all right and when it's
[15:43] meted back to you the same God told me
[15:46] said if you can't forgive your brother I
[15:49] can't forgive you
[15:53] and forgive ya forget it no we can't
[15:57] forget it well we sure can forgive so
[16:03] that's the rough part of this you saw
[16:05] I'm not in that group over there the
[16:07] covetous travelers them but what about
[16:09] that ideas you got this against the Word
[16:11] of God same demon same devil you say
[16:17] even with the Holy Ghost even with the
[16:19] whole ego come that's in your soul when
[16:24] you raise a new reasoning in your your
[16:26] five middle senses right okay yes for
[16:30] your reasoning out because remember God
[16:32] no reason with itself God don't argue
[16:36] with this hell the reason we argue with
[16:39] God is goes around here in this memories
[16:41] and cons of things okay you said are you
[16:43] done yeah we argue with God every day
[16:46] why may you
[16:48] why'd it happen to me what are you doing
[16:49] that way and Paul is saying look guys
[16:53] you're inexcusable because then people
[16:57] are what they're just manifesting what
[16:59] they're doing in their flesh and you're
[17:02] harboring the same spirit in your spirit
[17:06] that's what he's saying cuz of you
[17:09] Jackie look but we are sure that the
[17:14] judgment of God so you think about the
[17:16] gun the judgment of God in the cording
[17:19] countries against them which commit such
[17:21] things and think it's now this cold land
[17:25] still come my god
[17:27] then just then which do such things and
[17:30] doest the same that thou shalt escape
[17:32] the judgment of God you will not are
[17:36] despised down the riches of his goodness
[17:38] and forbearance and longsuffering not
[17:40] knowing that the goodness of God leads
[17:42] thee to Reformation in the original
[17:46] let's read five now you read that I read
[17:49] this the boon Michael love it up here
[17:53] according to the hardness listen this is
[17:57] the problem herein lies our problem
[18:01] our problem is is we justify the spirits
[18:06] that we have I do you can meet what are
[18:14] you doing out there you do but what is
[18:18] it it's hardness and impenitent heart
[18:21] let's look at that word of thing Dada it
[18:28] many no change of mind unrepented now
[18:34] how in the world can you live a
[18:35] Christian life without repentance that's
[18:40] why I ask time to forgive you don't mean
[18:42] dealing with to a situation of the thing
[18:43] we just really end this that down and
[18:45] just forgive each other
[18:48] right but ask God to forgive me but I
[18:51] had to ask you to forgive me complete we
[18:53] were having enough Colley we have a
[18:55] problem
[18:56] bad it was all she done
[19:04] okay what I'm after first off
[19:06] accompanied by - oh she doesn't know it
[19:10] was something she done and I reacted
[19:12] wrong
[19:12] so this problem was it okay when we make
[19:21] them but after the harness and antenna
[19:25] don't know what forgiveness here and
[19:29] they say y'all they believe you might
[19:30] think I'm saying something there even
[19:32] I'm not same way with God because we got
[19:35] withdraws itself from you cuz we're
[19:39] supposed to have relationship with God
[19:40] right well when we have a problem I said
[19:42] we have a probably you don't ever go
[19:44] wrong we have a problem what do we do
[19:47] pull yourself away right God who are you
[19:52] well he's right where you left right and
[19:55] that's what Paul is saying goes watch
[19:57] it's gonna keep going we won't get to
[20:01] the hall today the pole is gonna bring
[20:03] us right back into to them to by patient
[20:08] continuance in well doing seek for glory
[20:10] and honor immortality and eternal life
[20:13] Paul always gives you a way out
[20:16] God always give you a way out man but
[20:20] you got to go through those steps so
[20:22] when you give them a headache died you
[20:24] said I've never been mad at God yeah
[20:26] even then again yeah God why did you
[20:29] when you say why the god you're in your
[20:32] you're in the devil's playground right
[20:33] there right why God well don't ask you
[20:37] what thank you Lord and let me realize
[20:42] what you're doing because I want to have
[20:45] that intimate relationship with you
[20:47] begin right okay that's why we read the
[20:51] other day that the things that we see
[20:53] there in verse 1 the things that we see
[20:56] in our life has to creepiness to
[21:00] Christian people even is to unchristian
[21:01] but as to Christian people husband wife
[21:04] walk too much the Bible said it should
[21:07] be as Christ and the church or the body
[21:11] right right
[21:12] the way you treat your wife the way you
[21:14] treat your husband same thing alright
[21:16] I'm at four you said here's an example
[21:20] of how we go through our day and walk
[21:22] alive when we have our problems but
[21:24] remember we are finite and god's
[21:29] infinite so the argument that we had was
[21:34] an argument we have God won't argue
[21:36] so I say when you say why the God is
[21:38] he's like go back over there you need to
[21:41] rethink this thing delano why and me
[21:44] alright cuz you know what he's gonna do
[21:48] he's gonna say read what I already wrote
[21:50] okay I already put in its contract dear
[21:54] read this read what I wrote but most of
[21:59] the people don't religious people now
[22:01] that you are not having to do this in
[22:03] your flesh but what you have in you is
[22:06] the same thing that those the whole list
[22:10] yes that's why I don't wanna be judged
[22:14] by my work if I put myself in Christ
[22:18] he's already been judging I don't have
[22:21] to be jealous today okay
[22:23] not sure there's a judgment of be
[22:25] studying the body was a good bet that is
[22:27] correct but that is not in yourself it
[22:29] doesn't mean whether you were literally
[22:31] turn or a big eternal no you're just an
[22:33] eternal is gone even if you want again
[22:35] okay
[22:36] God don't he's not a respecter of person
[22:38] I will read unjust men but after the
[22:45] hardness and impenitent heart there's a
[22:48] problem after our hardness and
[22:50] impenitent our unrepentant heart
[22:54] treasures up unto thyself wrath against
[22:58] her
[23:05] there's what you doing baby but after
[23:09] the hardness and dependent of our
[23:11] treasure is white look it's like oh that
[23:15] was always said it's true we do the same
[23:17] thing with God you get mad at your wife
[23:21] than you you just build this case up you
[23:25] know you just build this thing up and
[23:26] then boy you're ready to come in and
[23:27] just let her have it or she get ready to
[23:29] let you have it and then you see the
[23:33] love so when love projects grace takes
[23:36] over you mean you don't worry about all
[23:39] that so what you're doing is if you have
[23:40] a hard and infinite heart you're laying
[23:43] up treasures them to thyself wrath
[23:46] against the damn wrath and revelation of
[23:48] the righteous judgment of God who will
[23:52] render to every man according to his
[23:54] deeds or the Bible says we will award to
[23:58] each according to his works
[24:00] I look to them goodbye patience know
[24:04] what do them goodbye patient patient
[24:08] continuance in well doing seek for glory
[24:11] and honor and the immortality and
[24:13] eternal life in other words we'll have
[24:15] problems but we still got to strive have
[24:19] patience because he's inserting this for
[24:22] us no watch but then he goes back to
[24:24] verse 8 but unto them that are
[24:27] contentious and do not obey the truth
[24:30] but obey unrighteousness indignation and
[24:33] wrath tribulation and anguish upon every
[24:35] soul oh man - do the people on the Jews
[24:38] first notion of the Gentile let's read
[24:41] the Greek had non life indeed to those
[24:47] verse 7 who by perseverance and good
[24:50] works are seeking for glory and honor
[24:53] and incorruptibility but indignation and
[24:57] wrath to those who are fatuous and obey
[25:01] not the truth but obey unrighteousness
[25:03] legend and distress on every soul of man
[25:05] working evil first of the Jews and then
[25:09] at the Greek look look verse 10 the
[25:17] glory and honor and peace to everyone
[25:19] working good to the Jew first and also
[25:25] the Gentile now what's he doing remember
[25:28] Paul speaking to the Romans the Romans
[25:30] are Gentiles Romans are not Jews the
[25:34] Romans are Gentile the next time back to
[25:36] the Jews first because Christ came to
[25:38] the Jews first and then rejected him now
[25:41] he's going to the Greeks are the
[25:43] Gentiles verse 11
[25:46] very plain for there is no particular
[25:50] allottee God he doesn't pick this one
[25:55] I'll make this one better than the other
[25:56] one
[25:56] all right you can't because it can't be
[25:59] a righteous joke if he does what's right
[26:01] okay okay far as many as halves and
[26:04] without law shall also perish without
[26:07] law and as many as have sinned in the
[26:09] law shall be judged by the law
[26:12] let me read verse 12 again therefore as
[26:15] many as sinned without local parish also
[26:18] without law and as many as stand under
[26:21] the law will be judged by the law now
[26:23] he's fixing to interpolate the you verse
[26:29] 13 now he's going to interpolate this
[26:31] hole now the word fifth thing see the
[26:34] quotation so he's interpolate he's in
[26:37] interjecting a thought to help you
[26:40] understand them before and after
[26:44] so now excuse me for me doing
[26:48] this they believe we're gonna have no
[26:50] wife let's take out thirteen fourteen
[26:52] big thing whereas many have sinned
[26:54] without long job so perish without law
[26:57] and as many as have sinned in the home
[26:59] shall be judged by the law in the day
[27:04] when God shall judge the secrets of men
[27:06] by Jesus Christ according to my gospel
[27:07] then he leaves a lot he leaves are
[27:12] thought to be desired there
[27:14] so what it's going to do God brings the
[27:16] thought of Paul and he's going to
[27:18] explain it right here in 1314 beeping
[27:21] that's the interval interpolating part
[27:24] Paul is not interpreting he's
[27:26] interpolating he's what he's stopping to
[27:29] make sure that you understand the point
[27:30] and he's giving you a few other little
[27:32] pointers to understand what God said
[27:34] we're not the hearers of the law are
[27:36] just before God but the doers of the law
[27:39] shall be justified for when the Gentiles
[27:41] which have not to LA cuz remember
[27:43] Gentiles no more the law do by Nature
[27:47] look there's a lot of things that the
[27:50] Gentiles did by nature that was in the
[27:54] Torah that Jews are not supposed to do
[27:58] they just didn't do it
[28:00] just like one brother Brown said about
[28:02] the statue of a perfect man he said
[28:04] there's a lot of what people have these
[28:06] virtues now they're not godly virtue but
[28:08] they have the human part of that and
[28:10] don't even a not even born again so the
[28:13] Gentiles but see that doesn't that
[28:15] didn't make the Gentiles right so you
[28:20] see what I'm saying just because you
[28:21] live a good and I see that and he just
[28:24] it burns in my heart I I saw it over a
[28:27] couple in the airport the other day when
[28:30] we were going to Arizona and what they
[28:33] were you know they were probably in
[28:34] their eighties but I mean they were just
[28:38] so lovey-dovey and oh just you know
[28:41] getting together and said and smiling
[28:43] and talking not you know what God you
[28:46] probably give them a good life but if
[28:48] they're not born again
[28:50] they're both may end up in hell
[28:52] I stripped away together so it's not the
[28:56] goodness of the Gentiles hmm come to
[28:59] Gentile hey listen the Jews lived along
[29:01] one got never lost so the wall has no
[29:05] strength in it Nepali tell us that later
[29:07] on okay mmm it was weak while I was ill
[29:12] all week it beat on this guy okay
[29:16] you can get in the stall and change that
[29:18] person if you let him change that person
[29:21] for when the Gentiles let's have enough
[29:24] to law do by nature the things contained
[29:26] in the law these having not too long our
[29:30] law to themselves so they've made your
[29:32] own law right we show the work of the
[29:35] law written in their hearts their
[29:36] conscience also bearing witness and
[29:38] their thoughts the mean while accusing
[29:40] or else excusing one another so let's
[29:43] read the Little Miss read the Greek
[29:46] verse thirteen we're not the hearers of
[29:50] law are just before God but the doers of
[29:53] law will be justified when therefore now
[29:56] remember you be justified and not be
[29:58] born again it's ready because you will
[30:01] be there will be a group of people guys
[30:04] by law because remember the law was good
[30:10] before Christ came all those in the Old
[30:11] Testament lived under the law but that's
[30:18] due to know
[30:22] who that verse 14 when therefore those
[30:25] Gentiles not having a law naturally
[30:29] perform the things of the law these
[30:31] though they do not possess a law our law
[30:35] to themself okay demonstrate the work of
[30:39] the law written on their hearts their
[30:42] conscience
[30:43] Khoa testing what that word is ATP is
[30:48] int and the reasoning between each other
[30:51] accusing are defending now you paste the
[30:56] thought back that in the day when God
[30:58] shall judge the secrets of men hearts by
[31:00] what by Jesus Christ don't agree this
[31:03] right here then in the day when
[31:08] according to my glad tidings God will
[31:11] judge in things of men through Christ
[31:16] Jesus now watch what he done he took all
[31:21] first sixteen verses and put it in one
[31:25] verse right because God is gonna judge
[31:29] the secrets and that's when he stole my
[31:31] way up there did I tell my wife I listen
[31:34] it's not a secret I stay another day you
[31:36] know if you if you out your workshop and
[31:40] and your doors open you you know
[31:42] gobernador you thinker you stump your
[31:44] toe and you say that the mad word you
[31:47] know and your neighbor hears you
[31:49] well that's not a witness but what more
[31:54] if there was no way around than you said
[31:56] it
[31:56] God hurt you right see so what I'm
[32:00] saying is that's a secret
[32:03] it ain't a secret if you sit on your
[32:05] front porch and drink the twelve like a
[32:06] beer I mean your neighbor sees you
[32:08] that's not as either but if you got
[32:12] something in your refrigerator and I'm
[32:14] just drawing like this is natural think
[32:15] I'm gonna you understand I'm talking
[32:17] about spiritual things that we hide
[32:20] because remember we are controlled by
[32:22] spirits I want us to realize that we're
[32:25] hmm if you don't get anything from these
[32:27] seals get one thing there's not a horse
[32:31] running through your life you'd
[32:37] understand one thing they're not a
[32:38] natural horse riding through your life
[32:42] is it they'll give you power in the day
[33:00] one guard to adjust the secret square
[33:03] thanks brother and today when God shall
[33:09] judge the secrets of men by who Jesus
[33:11] Christ according to my gospel
[33:15] look how positive he was don't you two
[33:19] realize something what was inside of his
[33:22] gospel he didn't say the secrets of men
[33:28] hearts active Jesus came and 90% of the
[33:35] world never knew well 99% of the world
[33:38] never knew you'd fall ones 99% of the
[33:42] people never heard he's gone at that
[33:45] time and the time he wrote that is man
[33:47] you got to go back to the time he wrote
[33:49] it once he was writing it now not now
[33:51] that's when all over the world
[33:53] machines prophesy good look if you take
[34:00] this Bible too much there's this one do
[34:03] you take this Bible all over the country
[34:07] today people are preaching now that
[34:08] Bible in there Peter if they preaching a
[34:10] false doctrine they're gonna be judged
[34:11] by what Paul just said okay surely so we
[34:20] if we don't get it correct get those
[34:24] little demons of whatever happened the
[34:27] whole they are called a Jew and rest us
[34:30] in the law and make us not boast in God
[34:34] and know if it will and approve is the
[34:37] things that are more excellent being
[34:40] instructed out of the law no watch any
[34:48] reason
[34:49] maintain and knoweth didn't will induce
[34:53] discern superior thing this is verse 18
[34:56] notices will improve the things that are
[34:58] more excellent way and dust desert
[35:01] superior things being instructed out of
[35:05] the law no words the law is good but but
[35:09] what are they doing his will is is your
[35:11] be instructed out of the law okay you're
[35:17] being instructed now what am I saying
[35:19] we're not living under the wall right
[35:20] now if you're born again you've come out
[35:24] from under the law and you're under
[35:26] grace but now there is a group of evil
[35:28] then we'll be doing is under the law
[35:30] okay now watch verse 19 and has to
[35:35] believe their self to be a guide of the
[35:37] blind and lot of those in darkness an
[35:41] instructor of the foolish a teacher of
[35:44] bait which has the form of knowledge and
[35:47] of truth in the law and the reason
[35:52] hearing what an instructor of the simple
[35:56] a teacher of babes having the form of
[36:01] knowledge and of truth in the law does
[36:05] out then 321 you will stop right about
[36:09] 22 if you'll recall you watch it's
[36:12] thought that rent talks in hill
[36:15] interpolate and a man he'll start on
[36:18] something and something else which I
[36:21] would put a chapter in there but you
[36:23] know I don't know how they did that but
[36:24] you know what God didn't ask me I went
[36:27] born that's me like a man struck to the
[36:33] foolish teacher Basil's have formed
[36:34] knowledge and truth the law verse 22 now
[36:38] thou art staying do not commit adultery
[36:41] dost thou commit adultery oh no I never
[36:46] touched the woman no I don't go back to
[36:48] 21 everyday just about men who are
[36:52] teaching another not instruct
[36:57] when we're preaching the gospel we're
[36:59] getting it to okay now who are preaching
[37:05] do not steal that's now steal you saw
[37:08] I've never I don't steal time don't
[37:13] think when we have to miss onion peel
[37:16] the layers you say naw don't steal we
[37:19] did not steal it in your life and I'm
[37:20] going out bucks hell wide open that's
[37:25] what they're gonna do
[37:25] they're gonna stand up on a day of
[37:27] judgment this is what's gonna happen and
[37:29] they're gonna say God I didn't steal
[37:32] okay god I did and they're gonna be a
[37:36] checklist of things that they're gonna
[37:38] say I didn't do this I didn't do them
[37:39] but there's gonna be one thing whatever
[37:43] it is it's gonna be one thing and God's
[37:46] gonna say you disbelieve me doesn't
[37:51] matter this big laundry list of things
[37:53] that I did not do and even the big
[37:56] laundry list of the things they didn't
[37:57] do
[37:58] God's gonna say I came to you on a
[38:01] certain certain day and I'm presenting
[38:05] myself to you and you turn me down
[38:08] that's all it's gonna be it's not gonna
[38:10] be you know God's not gonna send a
[38:13] friend go now
[38:15] Bob black you didn't and you did and you
[38:19] didn't and you didn't know he's gonna
[38:22] say you remember that day that I came to
[38:25] you and you tames actually where
[38:28] everybody in the world he's got to come
[38:30] to is not they need to expect a person
[38:32] then he'll say did you turn me down
[38:36] right a jig second and you'll just bow
[38:40] your head and you'll say I turned you
[38:41] down because you'll know when you know
[38:42] and your safety and your person you
[38:44] turned you down
[38:45] well there's your judgment not that you
[38:47] did this and the whole laundry list of
[38:49] things right the dudes it somewhere
[38:54] break down brother around what is sin
[38:56] smoking drinking gambling cussing
[38:58] running around no no those it's
[39:02] disbelieving
[39:04] God's Word
[39:05] and he'll say that day you disbelieve
[39:10] that that was me coming to you and
[39:13] therefore judgment is nobody claps
[39:16] because what happens is when you do that
[39:19] unbelief all those other things are just
[39:21] attributes remember brother Graham said
[39:23] those are attributes of sin sand in the
[39:26] bottom line and a red coral yesterday I
[39:30] don't think I brought it hey brother I
[39:35] was talking about something he's making
[39:36] a comment to somebody and what about
[39:39] that but he was talking about unbelief
[39:43] he said y'all say all these things
[39:45] whatever we're talking my preachers
[39:47] doing this don't do that y'all saying
[39:49] all these things he said it boils down
[39:52] to either you blaspheme the holy though
[39:54] oh he was talking about somebody come to
[39:57] him and said well what about these women
[39:58] that are doing abortions and stuff like
[40:00] that
[40:00] they they sold their soul they Bluff he
[40:03] said no he said no that's not true he
[40:09] said the only thing they're gonna be
[40:10] judged by for when they turn the word
[40:11] down or not if you're a word rejecter
[40:14] work rejecters go to hell if your word
[40:17] of objective then that come to the time
[40:19] where that means you blacks being on
[40:20] young black men with all because it's
[40:24] the only way that you will not make it
[40:25] to heaven
[40:26] yeah you saw no telling you my brother
[40:32] Brown said he said don't worry about all
[40:34] this all I was hooking up last night it
[40:36] was about this we're talking about Saul
[40:37] committing suicide so didn't commit
[40:40] suicide but even brother I'm talking
[40:42] about people committing suicide we're
[40:44] not lost
[40:47] they could have a demon attach
[40:49] themselves to the person's spirit make
[40:52] you do things that well you know let's
[40:55] just be honest we think I've seen in my
[40:58] life older people that were I I feel
[41:04] we're born-again Christians but when
[41:06] they come down to be about 90 years old
[41:08] in their life but their brother the
[41:11] message he just got this spirit of
[41:13] cussin and what's being mean and but
[41:17] that wasn't him see that was that body
[41:19] that was that spirit realm that had
[41:22] overcome and they took over in this
[41:27] realm and so you don't you really don't
[41:30] that's enough they see you'd say well I
[41:32] judge that man he's going go to hell no
[41:34] he's on throwing it on the black it's
[41:37] just that he lost his mind what about
[41:40] the brother
[41:40] the brother Ramsay God come on Christian
[41:45] man those can get some six-pack of beer
[41:47] and just in other words he continually
[41:49] he let his spirit get on him and he
[41:52] didn't want to get it off of him so God
[41:53] said look you can't walk around this
[41:55] community with a beer in your hand
[41:57] you're my child I'm taking you home
[42:00] you know why do you did the best thing
[42:01] you could have done what's took that man
[42:03] home right okay he could blast me in the
[42:07] Holy Ghost so God wasn't away keep going
[42:09] keep going keep going with that spirit
[42:11] honey so let the Lord judge and let the
[42:16] work
[42:17] [Music]
