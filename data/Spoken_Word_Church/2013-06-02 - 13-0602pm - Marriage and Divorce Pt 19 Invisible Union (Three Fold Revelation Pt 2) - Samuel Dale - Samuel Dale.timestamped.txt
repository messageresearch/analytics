[0:00] in you we know if you ever saved one
[0:03] person if anybody else will reach that
[0:05] same position the same point of Faith or
[0:08] thinking upon you then you'll save them
[0:10] also because you're God and you cannot
[0:13] change we love you and we thank you have
[0:15] your way now speak to us and let your
[0:18] love be made manifest in each one of our
[0:20] hearts and lives and keep us in Jesus
[0:23] name
[0:25] amen Romans
[0:28] 7
[0:32] know ye not brethren for I speak to them
[0:34] that know the law how that the law had
[0:37] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[0:41] but now there's the key to the whole
[0:44] thing if we don't die and become born
[0:50] again you're still under the law that's
[0:52] right you said no the law was done away
[0:54] at Calvary Christ is the end of the
[0:58] law the Bible says for
[1:02] righteousness the law is still in
[1:04] existence out here the world will be
[1:06] judged by the Ten Commandment
[1:09] law is still in existence until you're
[1:12] born again only the Born Again believer
[1:15] is not under the
[1:17] law now think of those things I know
[1:20] sometimes maybe that I make strange
[1:23] statements but think about what is
[1:26] said unless you're born again you're
[1:29] still under the law
[1:31] right so then we've got to
[1:34] die that's the best way to get it you
[1:37] know right we got to die to ourselves
[1:39] and become born again now an
[1:42] illustration see for the woman which
[1:44] hath a husband is bound by the law to
[1:47] her husband as long as he liveth but if
[1:50] the husband be dead she is loose from
[1:52] the law of her husband so her old
[1:54] husband must be dead for us to be born
[1:56] again right so then if while her husband
[1:59] liveth
[2:00] she' be married to another man she be
[2:02] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[2:05] husband be dead she is free from that
[2:07] law so that she is no adulterous though
[2:09] she be married to another
[2:11] man wherefore my brethren you also are
[2:14] become dead to the law how by the body
[2:17] of Christ that you should be married to
[2:20] another even to him who is raised from
[2:22] the dead that we should bring forth
[2:26] fruit unto God or when we were in the
[2:29] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[2:31] the law did work in our members not the
[2:34] Ten Commandments the law there see it's
[2:36] the law it's the law that while we were
[2:38] in the flesh we were controlled by the
[2:41] flesh see there's many laws in the Bible
[2:45] that is not just Ten Commandment law
[2:48] when you say law to most people it say
[2:49] Ten Commandments the whole
[2:52] Bible is the
[2:54] law unless you're born again all right
[2:58] for when we were in the flesh the
[2:59] Motions of sin which were by the law
[3:02] because of that law of us being where we
[3:05] were born did work in our members to
[3:07] bring forth fruit unto death but now we
[3:10] are delivered from the law what that
[3:13] being dead wherein we were held that we
[3:17] should serve in the newness of spirit
[3:18] and not in the oldness of the letter
[3:20] amen you may be born you may be seated
[3:23] cuz see if you're born again you may be
[3:25] born again I
[3:28] hope two thoughts in the same
[3:32] mouth that's pretty
[3:34] good my wife laughs at me because I have
[3:38] been guilty of of reading a book and
[3:42] listening to a
[3:43] tape and uh the tape would be one
[3:47] message and the book would be another
[3:51] one she said what are you
[3:54] doing but see I'm just listening to a
[3:57] point on that tape to till I get a
[3:59] thought cuz I know it's in that message
[4:01] then I stop and write it down you know
[4:03] but uh you know so you it does work
[4:06] sometimes it does split and work and I
[4:08] hope we ar born again because if we're
[4:10] born
[4:11] again then we don't have to worry about
[4:14] the rest of it all right now to get back
[4:16] to the point of this morning what is our
[4:22] thought that in the message called The
[4:25] Invisible Union is a marvelous message
[4:28] to me I really enjoy reading it now if
[4:31] you could just see the one I've got back
[4:32] in the office it's just one slap out
[4:35] from reading so much on it you know and
[4:38] writing notes and things on it but to me
[4:42] you can take that message and just go
[4:45] through it and you can just glean out
[4:48] the thoughts that he's bringing you can
[4:49] see that he's speaking to a
[4:51] denominational
[4:53] World in a denominational
[4:56] church and telling them how bad
[4:58] organized Rel religion
[5:02] is that's an amazing thing that they
[5:04] even let him come and preach you know
[5:07] and do but he's preaching the new
[5:10] birth but he's preaching about marriage
[5:12] and divorce he's preaching about law and
[5:15] Grace he gets on the future home and
[5:18] he's preaching about the soul of man
[5:20] being saved and he's preaching about
[5:24] these bodies being
[5:26] changed then he's preaching of a future
[5:28] home that will go live in when this
[5:30] world is totally
[5:32] redeemed but see then you just read the
[5:34] message and you don't glean out which
[5:36] way he's placing it maybe that's not the
[5:39] right word for it but you know you just
[5:41] kind of listen to what he's saying so
[5:45] then thereby as we were talking last
[5:46] night about you know the progressiveness
[5:49] of of the word as it unfolds to us see
[5:52] maybe the first time you read invisible
[5:54] Union first time you read the future
[5:55] home maybe you only were thinking about
[5:57] the new birth right
[6:00] well that's what you were receiving from
[6:03] it but then it moves up see into the
[6:07] future home in the in the invisible
[6:09] Union moves up that's what I'm trying to
[6:12] do now in a three-fold revelation is to
[6:14] talk about the New Birth because as I
[6:18] was trying to express this morning
[6:20] there's no need of you worrying about
[6:22] whether your marital problems is messed
[6:24] up or
[6:25] not until you're born again right
[6:29] because until then you're only dealing
[6:31] with and I was looking a moment ago I
[6:32] should have ran it off where the Prophet
[6:34] says we try to make these
[6:39] bodies come under
[6:42] law and that's
[6:45] commendable that's
[6:47] great I'd like to see a whole world
[6:51] full of
[6:54] people that were trying to do right
[6:58] wouldn't you right amen it it would be a
[7:02] Utopia but see it's not so because it's
[7:05] what Paul said we had that motions of
[7:08] sin developed in us and it'll never be
[7:10] that way there's always going to be
[7:12] killings and and everything else because
[7:15] mankind are not born
[7:17] again but yet
[7:21] still if we could just think about the
[7:23] new
[7:25] birth and think about how that every
[7:29] thing is hinged upon whether or not
[7:32] you're born
[7:34] again don't worry about the marital
[7:37] situations don't worry about the the uh
[7:43] Rapture because if you're not born again
[7:45] you're not
[7:47] going why worry about something you're
[7:49] not going to be a part
[7:51] of see why the prophet would say the new
[7:54] birth is the most important thing in the
[7:57] world right and like I said it would be
[8:00] then the very first
[8:03] doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[8:06] right that you must be born
[8:09] again the first thing that he was trying
[8:12] to deal
[8:13] with was to get people saved amen but we
[8:18] worry about the other
[8:20] things well brother Dale just can't you
[8:23] explain this to
[8:27] me let's get get born again
[8:31] right and then we can see that even the
[8:34] same
[8:35] illustrations of the new
[8:38] birth you know remember the message I
[8:40] went through about illustrating you know
[8:42] you illustrate something you give an
[8:44] example Paul is talking about a man must
[8:46] be
[8:48] dead then he's illustrating it as a like
[8:52] a marriage and divorce situation but
[8:54] he's really talking about law and Grace
[8:58] right but see let's get it into the
[9:00] point of what we need for the time or
[9:02] what we're
[9:03] doing maybe we'll do like the lbby said
[9:06] the other day she said Papa's been
[9:08] preaching on my name for a
[9:11] while her name's Abby Grace so she
[9:14] picked that up I've been preaching on
[9:17] Grace well see we we quote a lot but do
[9:21] we really understand right the Bible
[9:23] says that we saved by
[9:26] what because I shouted spoken T cried
[9:29] and done this and done that and I was a
[9:32] good person and and and you know no it
[9:36] says you're saved by
[9:38] grace now what's the point it doesn't
[9:41] say you're saved by
[9:44] faith oh I had this great Revelation I'm
[9:47] saved I can see the message so I'm
[9:51] saved it doesn't say that it says you're
[9:55] saved by
[9:56] grace amen that's through
[10:00] Faith amen through is a journey right
[10:03] amen of life that we're going through
[10:06] through Revelation sure then what is the
[10:09] new
[10:09] birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[10:13] personally to you is that what the
[10:14] prophet
[10:16] said not all these other things is
[10:18] whether or not you're born again all
[10:21] right so then we'll try to take that
[10:23] point and I was asked a little question
[10:27] so he gave me an opportunity
[10:29] excuse me about the cough drop because I
[10:31] have to put him in or I have to shut him
[10:34] up one so we'll put in the cough
[10:39] drop I've been doing good here lately
[10:41] preaching preaching many services but I
[10:44] know when I tax my voice a little hard
[10:46] like this morning I got a problem but
[10:49] forgive
[10:51] me but you're saved by grace through
[10:55] faith right that not of works lest any
[10:59] man should boast what good thing is it
[11:02] that we could do to be
[11:09] saved now you know that I'm not throwing
[11:11] stones at nobody but you know yourself
[11:14] you go to churches
[11:16] and back some of the old days and things
[11:19] and he said well that brother and I know
[11:22] he was a bad brother but he paved the
[11:23] parking lot he's going to be in
[11:26] glory they always want to put it on some
[11:29] form of something we done or didn't do
[11:35] right well I never did lie to cheat or
[11:37] steal that don't make no difference
[11:38] you're lost
[11:41] amen it didn't make me lost because I
[11:44] began to lie and cheat and still that
[11:45] just part of my
[11:47] nature that's just part of my
[11:49] ways and then it always comes up see to
[11:52] try to preach the truth it's a whole lot
[11:55] easier to preach a lie than it is the
[11:57] truth and you you try to tell the truth
[11:59] and then people say you don't want us to
[12:01] live good no I don't want you to live
[12:06] good think that
[12:10] over out in the world I there just
[12:12] listening to it think it over I'm honest
[12:15] I want you born
[12:16] again if you get born again it'll take
[12:19] care of the
[12:20] life the r said don't you women think
[12:24] that you're hiring you're dress and
[12:25] clothes that means you're saved that's
[12:28] right
[12:30] where would it be by
[12:32] grace through a revelation from God's
[12:35] word that's the prophet what is a new
[12:37] birth he said it's the revelation of
[12:40] Jesus Christ as I said a minute ago
[12:42] personally to you amen not to brother
[12:44] brandom right and
[12:47] you God uses people to speak to us right
[12:51] amen go Faith cometh by
[12:55] hearing but see it's a personal
[12:57] experience
[12:59] of a new
[13:01] birth and you're not born again in your
[13:05] body right there's no faculty part of
[13:07] your body that can be born again that se
[13:10] taste field smell
[13:12] here you know all right you're not born
[13:15] again in your spirit because your spirit
[13:18] is memory reason conscience affection
[13:21] Love and stuff like
[13:23] that you can love
[13:26] God and still be lost that's right
[13:30] right
[13:32] right you see people that that are just
[13:35] great
[13:37] people but that they don't claim
[13:42] salvation being good then is not what it
[13:44] is so you're not born again in your
[13:48] body you're not born again in your
[13:51] spirit you're born again in your soul
[13:55] amen and that soul is the part of you
[14:00] that was what I was asked while ago when
[14:02] was I going to maybe bring another
[14:05] series on the
[14:07] soul so we'll just put a little bit in
[14:09] right here pick up our
[14:11] thought to make sure that we
[14:16] understand see what's the difference in
[14:18] a human being and an animal we're
[14:20] nothing more than just a higher form of
[14:22] an animal that's right we're just the
[14:25] highest form of a
[14:27] mammal you know warm-blooded
[14:32] beings but there's the secret and
[14:34] mystery that we never could understand
[14:36] of Darwin's theory of evolution and
[14:39] couldn't see the difference between or
[14:41] the connection between man and the
[14:43] monkey and you know they've tried to
[14:45] breed the man and the monkey together to
[14:47] try to get things out of it and they
[14:48] can't get
[14:50] it all
[14:51] right because that that was a different
[14:56] makeup right but in the Gard
[14:59] Garden there was an animal between man
[15:02] and the monkey right and that animal
[15:06] would be called in Genesis the
[15:09] beast but it would be called The
[15:11] Serpent that's the key to the thing it
[15:14] says the Ser the the the serpent the the
[15:18] the Beast was the most subtable of all
[15:20] of the
[15:20] serpents you know
[15:23] all he wasn't a snake to start with if
[15:27] you even got a scoffield Bible
[15:29] if you'll read in the Bible of the Beast
[15:31] that even scofi
[15:33] himself in your Bible if you'll turn to
[15:36] the front and read his footnotes he said
[15:38] it was an upright
[15:40] creature made a
[15:43] snake see it was a
[15:46] beast all
[15:47] right it's the missing link that Darwin
[15:50] could not figure out how to get those
[15:52] two together right he could cross
[15:55] everything else but he couldn't cross
[15:57] that line because it was just
[15:59] destroyed cuz that's what happened the
[16:02] beast in the garden it was destroyed
[16:05] made a snake see where was an upright
[16:08] creature then it was made a
[16:11] snake all right in other words put in
[16:14] the snake
[16:16] domain never to be able to mingle back
[16:20] again all right but in doing that see
[16:24] then that caused CU what we believe that
[16:27] Eve had a relationship ship with the
[16:29] Beast right amen and I said this morning
[16:32] that surely wouldn't eaten apples right
[16:35] but to do that it made the human race
[16:37] being born
[16:38] wrong well now how much more could a
[16:40] seventh grade education man say
[16:44] than the way the prophet described
[16:48] it and he said that Beast that was in
[16:50] the garden said he was an upright
[16:52] creature look just like a man he could
[16:54] talk he talked with
[16:57] Eve
[16:59] but said he didn't have a soul
[17:02] right said he had a place for a soul but
[17:06] didn't have one now what's he meaning
[17:09] was an empty compartment in the Beast
[17:14] you know some hole some
[17:16] place or is that a
[17:19] terminology right of a person to express
[17:22] what it
[17:26] is that Beast was just look just like a
[17:32] man but it had no soul it had no
[17:35] connecting of a
[17:37] being that was with inside of it that
[17:41] would make it long after
[17:46] God because that's what the soul of man
[17:50] is then no matter where in the world you
[17:52] are you find people searching for God
[17:56] worshiping totem poles
[17:59] animals
[18:00] Stars
[18:02] cows uh
[18:04] whatever
[18:07] why because within man there's a there's
[18:10] a part that the animal don't
[18:12] have and that's a soul amen right and
[18:16] that Soul was created in the image of
[18:20] God and remember Ezekiel 184 says All
[18:23] Souls are mine
[18:25] amen I know there's doctrines in the
[18:27] message no need to worry about them but
[18:30] they teach that Satan gave you a soul
[18:32] well he can't do it cuz he can't
[18:37] create he cannot create that's the old
[18:39] two Soul doctrin forms but Satan can't
[18:43] create but he can
[18:45] pervert all right so as quick as the
[18:49] babies came or or quick as the not the
[18:52] babies but Adam and Eve to start he
[18:54] immediately through the Beast attacks
[18:57] Eve
[18:59] and he gets her to do wrong and that
[19:02] perverts the wound and that makes all of
[19:04] us born
[19:06] wrong there are doctrines among
[19:09] organized religion I heard of this many
[19:12] many many years before I heard of the
[19:14] Prophet that they believe that man
[19:17] didn't have a soul until the law
[19:20] came because you can go through the
[19:23] scriptures and by Paul saying by that
[19:26] coming the way we did we have a
[19:28] knowledge of sin
[19:31] yeah but see the Bible said that Adam
[19:34] became a living Soul
[19:36] right right so God created all the
[19:41] animals I believe in
[19:43] evolution but not the way man teaches it
[19:47] I believe in Creative
[19:49] Evolution God created this animal the
[19:52] next animal in a higher form the next
[19:53] one a higher the next one a higher each
[19:55] one that way science could go crazy
[19:59] trying to put the parts back
[20:02] together and miss the whole thing right
[20:05] right but then he came up and he made
[20:07] the Beast then he made the man and he
[20:10] made the man a living
[20:12] Soul so what is a soul of an
[20:18] individual really what is a
[20:24] soul see then you're a body Spirit soul
[20:29] as a triun being that we
[20:31] are the animal has the body he has the
[20:35] spirit form of
[20:38] life and certain amount of reasoning
[20:41] factors goes with the animal race I said
[20:45] a certain amount because he can't do a
[20:46] whole
[20:47] lot but yet didn't be trained because
[20:50] see he has the brain he has the mental
[20:54] capacities of the of the a little bit of
[20:57] memory reasoning conscience and things
[20:59] about
[21:01] him that it's amazing what they can do
[21:04] with an animal right but still you take
[21:07] the animal you turn it loose it'll do
[21:09] just exactly what it's been
[21:11] doing you can teach a bird to
[21:16] talk
[21:18] right but you turn him loose he go back
[21:20] and build his nest the same way build it
[21:22] the first
[21:23] time why because he cannot continue on
[21:27] that thought
[21:29] right any more than to be able to speak
[21:31] outwardly from the mental part of a
[21:33] brain of an
[21:36] animal but mankind see that's why he was
[21:39] cast out of the garden if you remember
[21:41] cuz the Bible says the imagination of
[21:43] man's mind is continually
[21:46] evil so we had to run him out of the
[21:49] garden all
[21:51] right see because that's the part of us
[21:54] that something with inside of
[21:56] us makes us just always wanting to be
[22:01] creating doing things
[22:03] different and and I'm enjoying it myself
[22:07] now whether you are or not I like an air
[22:09] conditioned house I like an air
[22:11] conditioned church I like an air
[22:13] conditioned
[22:14] car you know I I like the good things of
[22:18] Life all right I was raised where you
[22:22] know everybody likes but it's no joke
[22:25] where you could look through the wall
[22:26] and see the neighbor coming without
[22:28] opening the door you could look down
[22:30] through the floor and see the chickens
[22:32] under the house and you could look up
[22:34] through the top and see the
[22:36] stars a lot of you was never raised that
[22:39] way you know it was colder inside the
[22:42] house than it was
[22:44] outside I never could figure that
[22:47] out
[22:49] but but see I enjoy that because that's
[22:52] the part of man he's building look at
[22:54] him and he says you got to put him out
[22:56] cuz see nothing is withholding from
[22:59] man the prophet of God said he's broke
[23:02] into God's laboratory look at him take
[23:06] what's in my
[23:07] hand
[23:09] Adams send a
[23:12] rocket millions of miles into the
[23:15] sky and bring it
[23:19] back why because of that soul of that
[23:22] man right that's in the image of his
[23:25] creator he's a little Creator himself
[23:30] all right but what really is a
[23:34] soul see we can look at the body and we
[23:36] can see the sea face taste feels melon
[23:38] here we can look at the spirit and we
[23:40] can see the memory reason conscious
[23:41] affections and but what is really the
[23:43] soul of man cuz that's the part of you
[23:45] that God is working
[23:48] on we'll read this in just a second I
[23:50] just pulled these up to where we could
[23:51] read some and then we'll try to finish
[23:53] our thought of this
[23:56] morning and see see that soul is
[24:00] a part of
[24:02] you that makes you what you are
[24:07] right
[24:10] now you can be in a coma you know laying
[24:14] in a
[24:17] bed you have no recognizable ability to
[24:20] be able
[24:21] to uh
[24:25] communicate but yet
[24:29] they'll tell you in a hurry don't go in
[24:30] a hospital room with somebody in a coma
[24:32] and talk
[24:34] wrong right because there's something
[24:37] about that person that will be able to
[24:41] remember those
[24:43] things something about you that's more
[24:46] real than the animal righten you can
[24:48] teach the animal to talk you can te him
[24:50] teach him to count you can teach him to
[24:52] do all kind of things but
[24:55] yet it's like I've always told you
[24:59] you the buyer the old boy buyer will
[25:03] even kill his own
[25:05] offspring to cause the female buyer to
[25:08] become receptive for him
[25:12] again and she will fight him to the
[25:15] death of her over over her
[25:18] Offspring right but in a few months
[25:21] she'll be looking up the
[25:23] buyer to make
[25:25] again because that's just the way
[25:27] they're
[25:28] made they can't bring it to a reasoning
[25:32] Factor but see that's what we can
[25:35] do God made us with that ability to
[25:38] think things
[25:39] out and to
[25:44] communicate have you ever noticed it's
[25:46] always been amazing to me I always
[25:48] wonder you know when a dog goes off well
[25:53] it I go down
[25:55] to Spanish Town and I hear the dog going
[25:59] ar ar is he barking in Spanish or is he
[26:01] barking in
[26:07] English right you say it's silly but I
[26:10] just try to make a
[26:13] point the dog understands
[26:17] go or what would be Spanish for go
[26:21] see
[26:23] well y they got a certain amount of
[26:26] ability but we're just hire that we can
[26:29] come up with all those languages but now
[26:32] think about
[26:33] it what makes you so
[26:37] different is because with inside of
[26:41] you is a
[26:46] soul that that Soul has a longing for
[26:53] God we perverted by the things of the
[26:56] world and the the way we live and what
[26:58] we
[27:00] do but every little kid is born with a
[27:02] good nature about him right now we call
[27:06] it turo
[27:07] twos we're just turo 73s I guess but you
[27:13] know but we we think about it being
[27:19] terrible but it's still has a love about
[27:24] it that's
[27:26] amazing coming from something with
[27:29] inside of it and then you just think
[27:30] about
[27:32] everybody is in some way or other is
[27:35] trying to find God right the said would
[27:39] it be the cow the totem pole the the
[27:42] images of whatever is made of people you
[27:44] worship or ancestry worships
[27:48] or and then doing all of
[27:51] that you're trying to find something to
[27:54] satisfy that inward part
[27:58] not just the body and the
[28:01] spirit cuz in the body and the spirit in
[28:03] the spirit realm especially because
[28:05] there memory reason and con see you can
[28:07] deal with a person and they can be
[28:09] converted from one thought to another
[28:12] one Doctrine to another one belief to
[28:15] another all
[28:17] right but once that Soul anchors
[28:22] amen he'll never be the
[28:26] same one contac in of with God no matter
[28:30] how bad you turn out you'll always have
[28:33] something to remember that because
[28:35] that's where God deals with a person
[28:38] at is in the
[28:41] soul because if he can get that Soul the
[28:44] prophet said to stand
[28:49] still you see salvation is not a
[28:51] horrible or a bad thing or a hard
[28:54] thing it's simply believing
[28:59] amen but you know there's a lot of
[29:01] people cannot put because of their
[29:02] training in life their the way they've
[29:04] been brought up they cannot that old
[29:06] husband we were talking about this
[29:08] morning that we were married to the
[29:10] Natural nature and because of all of
[29:13] that you wind up in being just not able
[29:16] to sensibly reason out things you've
[29:20] talked with people like that had you
[29:22] they said they just couldn't get them to
[29:24] reason about anything well I don't see
[29:26] God
[29:28] well I don't see nothing but
[29:33] God well see there's just a difference
[29:35] in the way you're
[29:37] doing but that soul that you
[29:42] are that soul will either answer here or
[29:47] later and the Bible doesn't say the
[29:49] spirit that sin us shall
[29:51] die it says the soul that sinth so the
[29:55] soul is a real part of you right amen
[29:58] now speaking spiritually speaking as we
[30:00] call
[30:02] it Jesus couldn't lay a finger on those
[30:06] Pharisees they had kept his word to the
[30:10] letter what about you trying your best
[30:13] to to bring people to a
[30:16] position and they're living exactly the
[30:18] way that you describe
[30:21] it you know exactly the way you want
[30:26] it
[30:28] and yet you try to contact them and they
[30:31] don't want
[30:35] you brother R said birth birth pains I'm
[30:38] pretty sure he said he couldn't get them
[30:41] Pharisees to admit they were Sinners
[30:45] where they could be
[30:48] saved because see you'd have to first
[30:50] realize your lost
[30:54] amen see then that way of preaching
[30:58] sure you watch it now you you've been
[31:00] around you you're old
[31:03] enough yeah I can get up here and preach
[31:05] on hir and dress and make you cry and
[31:07] laugh and scream and go home and change
[31:12] clothes but a few weeks later you'll
[31:14] have them back
[31:16] on cuz there's no conversion to it I can
[31:20] preach against
[31:22] alcohol and you can get up and SAR that
[31:25] you're not going to drink anymore
[31:28] a few weeks later you're going to be
[31:31] drinking preach against
[31:33] smoking people take them out lay them on
[31:35] the
[31:36] altar right throw them
[31:39] away two hours later they're out digging
[31:42] up butts as we call them the end of the
[31:43] cigarette that's left over from
[31:49] smoking one because there been no
[31:54] change mentally you were contacted
[31:58] even spiritually of the memories the
[32:00] reason the things you're
[32:03] contacted but yet that Soul doesn't
[32:07] change so no matter
[32:10] what and you can train people like you
[32:13] can train a
[32:16] dog you can train a dog to do
[32:20] things you can train people not to smoke
[32:23] not to drink not to
[32:26] chew
[32:27] and they can get in that as we talking
[32:29] about this morning that sanctification
[32:30] stage and they can come to that place
[32:33] until they just they they love God and
[32:37] they're just in a
[32:39] Warfare you
[32:41] know they're fighting constantly to try
[32:44] to keep theirself under
[32:48] control and they think that's
[32:53] Christianity but Christianity require
[32:57] requires death right
[33:01] amen it required that almighty God die
[33:05] Amen in human flesh am we know God can't
[33:09] die Spirit form FR come
[33:11] on but he died in that flesh that life
[33:14] left that body to go up and come back in
[33:18] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[33:20] Ghost on the dead of
[33:21] Pentecost into a group of people into
[33:23] their
[33:25] soul they had to hear that
[33:30] word cuz the Bible says faith comes by
[33:33] hearing if they had not heard the word
[33:35] there's no new birth until you hear the
[33:38] word amen come on you don't just fall
[33:42] out over the world Why didn't it fall
[33:44] out on the day of Pentecost to
[33:47] everybody right because it was only 120
[33:49] of them that had the word and held it
[33:52] yet 500 had seen him after his
[33:54] resurrection come on I'm quoting
[33:56] scripture where was the other 380 that
[33:58] even seen Jesus after his resurrection
[34:00] amen right they didn't hold
[34:03] on no M no doubt they might have been
[34:06] good people no doubt they in flesh and
[34:09] spirit realm they might have been
[34:11] Christians as we call them good
[34:13] people they didn't make it to the upper
[34:16] room cuz Jesus in the parable he said
[34:19] the so went forth and
[34:21] swed said when he s deceit said some
[34:24] took the word and held it right
[34:27] they counted it worthy they knew that it
[34:30] was
[34:33] something and see that's why that was
[34:35] talking about this morning Billy Graham
[34:37] said I can have 10,000 converts and
[34:39] maybe have 10 or 30 brother Rand said it
[34:43] like this he said Paul go into a meeting
[34:45] he got one he said he comes back in a
[34:48] few years and he got
[34:50] 30 he said Paul carried his own the
[34:54] group that he had a person on to a
[34:57] personal
[34:59] experience something with God dealing
[35:03] with that soul in other words Paul daily
[35:06] was sitting there there talking about
[35:08] the scriptures and the things with that
[35:10] person bringing them
[35:12] through trying to get him to
[35:15] see what salvation really
[35:18] was he was speaking to the
[35:21] soul you see as I said a moment ago
[35:24] preachers preach to the bodies and try
[35:26] to clean them up they preach to the
[35:28] spirits and they get people shouting and
[35:30] Glory Hallelujah they go out the door
[35:32] and live like the
[35:36] devil but you see that one
[35:38] person who was it DW Moody that was it
[35:41] told of him one to of them where the
[35:43] lady rented the barn and and got the
[35:46] preacher to come in and have a meeting
[35:47] and she thought it was a
[35:50] failure one person came
[35:53] right that one person came to the alar
[35:56] that night and got saved I believe it
[35:57] was Dr Moody I believe that's the
[35:58] correct one millions of
[36:02] souls won the glory because of that one
[36:05] little woman's job she
[36:08] done she probably died thinking that
[36:11] she'd
[36:13] failed but yet Dr Moody got an
[36:16] experience amen so I believe in an
[36:18] oldfashioned experience of justification
[36:22] chopping off your pie sins
[36:24] repenting I believe in Sint ification to
[36:27] come and cleanse the vessel and set it
[36:29] in order but I believe in the New Birth
[36:32] coming and living within that soul of
[36:34] that
[36:35] individual
[36:37] see then you know the story that even
[36:41] you can be anointed in your spirit with
[36:44] a genuine holy spirit of God and do
[36:46] great
[36:47] wonders bam
[36:51] was come on his his writings is in the
[36:54] Bible what he wrote was in the Bible not
[36:56] just about
[36:59] him but you
[37:01] see God is dealing with that
[37:06] soul and that soul may go a long
[37:09] time before it will ever move very
[37:14] much see it's that real part of
[37:17] you amen right see if you die the Bible
[37:21] says what your body goes to the Grave
[37:23] right the Bible says your spirit goes
[37:26] back to God who gave
[37:29] it but where does your soul
[37:36] go we know from The Prophet's message
[37:38] then the Soul goes beyond the curtain of
[37:42] time into the sixth Dimension as we call
[37:47] it in the Old Testament it was called
[37:49] Paradise the bosom of
[37:52] Abraham but it was the soul of the
[37:55] individual and when Jesus Christ died on
[37:58] the
[38:02] cross he said my soul is
[38:07] troubled then he said into thy hand I
[38:09] commend my
[38:12] spirit you know what God done he just
[38:15] exited out of that body and left that
[38:18] body hanging on a tree they took the
[38:19] body put it in the grave had it went
[38:22] long enough it would have rotten but it
[38:24] couldn't because it already said I not
[38:26] leave his soul in
[38:27] hell so what went to hell amen the Bible
[38:32] had done said that right
[38:34] David neither will I suffer my Holy One
[38:36] to see corruption so he was coming up
[38:38] before the corruption set
[38:41] in but his soul went to hell
[38:45] amen Paul or Peter I believe it picked
[38:47] it up and called it the spirits in
[38:49] prison they were disobedient in the
[38:51] longsuffering in the days of Noah
[38:53] because the word spirit and soul is an
[38:54] interchangeable word form even into the
[38:57] Greeks and the things you cannot Define
[39:00] a lot of times what it's speaking of you
[39:03] must take the example that it's bringing
[39:05] it in to understand what it's
[39:09] meaning but he said I'll not leave his
[39:11] soul in hell you realize he went to hell
[39:13] for you and I he didn't have to go to
[39:16] hell for himself he had no
[39:19] sin amen he that knew no sin the Bible
[39:22] said became sin what became my sin right
[39:26] he took my place I don't have to go to
[39:29] hell then right nobody has
[39:32] to all you got to do is be born
[39:37] again but he send his Spirit back on the
[39:40] day of Pentecost and we call that this
[39:41] well of spirit but the prophet done a
[39:43] wonderful job one day of saying said he
[39:45] sent back his spirit in the
[39:48] form IM morphe form where it
[39:52] was of the soul of
[39:55] God what was was it come back on the day
[39:57] of Pentecost just an anointing of a
[39:59] spirit falling
[40:04] down no that's right the soul of
[40:07] almighty God because see he had spent
[40:09] three and a half years getting them 120
[40:12] cleaned
[40:13] out planting enough words that it could
[40:15] drive that unclean Spirit
[40:18] out and then when that Holy Ghost came
[40:20] it just quickened that
[40:22] Soul it made that Soul alive so what is
[40:25] the soul of man it's the party you it's
[40:27] not your brain it's not your
[40:30] thoughts it's the part of you that is
[40:33] going to live on that's why I said a
[40:35] while ago the the Bible says the soul
[40:37] that
[40:40] sinth what does the bible say that the
[40:42] life's death is the death of the
[40:46] Soul why because that's you right you
[40:50] said well we're a unit well I agree and
[40:52] I got a quote
[40:54] here that
[40:57] we are Tri
[40:59] being Body Spirit
[41:02] Soul without any one of those things
[41:04] taken away you're not
[41:08] complete
[41:11] right you be laying there as I said in a
[41:13] coma you're still living you're still
[41:15] breathing you're still doing and even
[41:17] people will be talking Danny we was up
[41:19] in the hospital with him years ago when
[41:22] he had that real bad
[41:23] fall and for three or four no matter how
[41:26] many days we don't know he would sit up
[41:29] in the bed and talk to
[41:33] us he said we already have know it when
[41:35] the doctor said you need this operation
[41:38] he said get on with it that's what he
[41:40] said he said you ought to know I
[41:42] wouldn't
[41:44] awake but for so many days he talked to
[41:48] us and one day he woke up you know and
[41:55] wondered what was going on we had to
[41:56] explain to him what had taken
[42:00] place but yet he was still alive right
[42:04] he could remember certain things because
[42:06] of that ability of the human part's
[42:10] working but you see church I've never
[42:13] tried to get anybody saved in
[42:17] body I've never tried to get you saved
[42:19] in just a spirit real to get you to come
[42:21] to church and be good and and all of
[42:24] that if you're born again I don't have
[42:26] to worry about the rest of it you see
[42:28] yeah but all these preachers are after
[42:32] money I don't let you know what they
[42:35] are but that's all right that's their
[42:40] business but you see it's not your money
[42:44] that I'm after right
[42:46] am it's your soul that I'm after
[42:52] amen as a preacher I can contact that
[42:55] body
[42:56] and I can contact that spirit and I can
[42:58] get you to just put money in the
[42:59] offering
[43:01] plate you know just give it to me and I
[43:04] can just buy me and you Cadillac and man
[43:06] I can do all kind of
[43:10] things but you don't what to happen one
[43:12] of these days somebody will come along
[43:13] with a little better way of dealing with
[43:15] that spirit and they going to get you in
[43:17] their church and they going to have a
[43:18] new
[43:19] Cadillac and I'm going to be driving an
[43:21] old
[43:25] one talking about a soul but see if I
[43:28] can get you born
[43:31] again you mean you'd
[43:33] think if there was only two in this
[43:36] building today that's born again just
[43:39] two you mean those two would let me be
[43:44] hungry and be in
[43:49] need no they'd give me everything they
[43:51] got wouldn't it I do it to you I have
[43:53] done it so nobody can't argue the point
[43:55] what I have
[44:01] done you see that's the difference in
[44:03] being born
[44:05] again and just being a Christian by
[44:07] Christian Realms or whatever God is
[44:10] dealing with that
[44:13] soul that part of you
[44:17] that's so close to God until it's almost
[44:21] an immortal part of
[44:23] you brother random will even sometimes
[44:26] called it Immortal may even talk about a
[44:29] sinner but it's not an eternal part
[44:31] until it's born
[44:33] again but it's the real
[44:36] you it's that part of you that keeps you
[44:39] moving and going and doing and thinking
[44:42] correctly and then when everything goes
[44:45] wrong you
[44:49] know you know what I mean that when
[44:51] Trouble Comes away a lot of people just
[44:53] blow up and run off right you cross
[44:55] their Doctrine or ideas I was ending up
[44:57] this morning talking about
[45:00] it if you get upset with me for
[45:02] preaching the
[45:04] truth and you don't want to have nothing
[45:06] to do with me I still love you anyway it
[45:07] don't make no
[45:09] difference I still do anything in the
[45:11] world I could do it to help
[45:12] you but you see that's the way I can
[45:14] tell the difference whether you're
[45:15] genuine or
[45:17] not see a genuine a lot of times maybe
[45:20] not they don't understand they think
[45:22] you're throwing off on them they think
[45:24] you're calling their names you know when
[45:27] you're trying to save their
[45:29] soul and see then they realize it one
[45:32] day and then they just nothing can ever
[45:33] separate that
[45:35] part May separate in human flesh and
[45:37] live in different parts of the world but
[45:39] it'll never separate that
[45:41] part you cannot
[45:44] separate me from the man that brought me
[45:48] in this
[45:51] message because he dealt with My
[45:54] Soul
[45:56] for two
[46:00] years until I become born
[46:03] again you think I could ever deny that
[46:06] part no because it's part of my being
[46:10] part of my nature part of what I
[46:13] am you see the soul of an individual is
[46:17] it's it's entirely different than just a
[46:19] thinking of a some nature or some ways
[46:22] or some
[46:23] doings you are a person
[46:29] and there's a personality about
[46:33] you that no matter every soul is not the
[46:37] same you know what I mean now by that
[46:40] see it's according to your natures and
[46:42] your ways brother BR said if you're born
[46:44] again under a an emotional atmosphere
[46:47] you know spicing and he said that's what
[46:50] you want to deal
[46:52] with he said but if you're born again
[46:54] under a quiet more
[46:56] atmosphere he said that's the way you'll
[47:00] be why because it's the spirit of
[47:02] almighty God they can come
[47:05] in see then on the day of Pentecost when
[47:08] that that spirit of God came
[47:13] down and it touched that word that them
[47:16] them disciples that held 120 of them in
[47:18] the upper room the Propet called him
[47:20] spoken words Original Seed called him
[47:21] Little Seeds pulled back in the upper
[47:24] room little so little individuals
[47:27] sitting there waiting on
[47:29] something the one said hey look like we
[47:32] already got it let's just take it by
[47:33] faith and walk out somebody got up in
[47:35] the crowd and said wait a minute we
[47:36] don't have what he said right
[47:40] amen and I know I'm just natural
[47:43] carnal if that had have been me you know
[47:45] what I'd have
[47:46] said they jumped up bless God we got it
[47:49] we got it let's go let's just go face
[47:51] the world tell them about this Jesus and
[47:53] say okay you number one open the door
[47:59] you go open the
[48:00] door you go preach it if they don't kill
[48:03] you will'll help
[48:06] you you know what I'm saying there
[48:09] wasn't nobody going to go out that door
[48:11] cuz they were scared to
[48:13] death right amen but when that soul of
[48:17] almighty God dropped down into them
[48:20] individuals that little lick of fire
[48:22] that is it called it tongues of fire set
[48:25] on each one
[48:27] one not just sat on it come down and
[48:29] dwell in
[48:32] them and when it did they walked out of
[48:34] there every one of them want to
[48:36] die showed something happened on that
[48:39] inward
[48:40] part that was different from the body
[48:42] and the spirit of the
[48:44] man Paul said it's not I that liveth but
[48:47] Christ that liveth in me the life that I
[48:49] now live in the flesh I live by the
[48:51] faith as a Son of God he didn't claim to
[48:53] be living no more he claimed to be dead
[48:55] he claimed his old husband died the old
[48:58] nature of his soul not the nature of
[49:01] your
[49:03] body anybody in here get born again did
[49:05] it change the nature of your body other
[49:07] than the things you were
[49:08] doing you know you quit doing all of
[49:11] these other things you know what I'm
[49:12] saying Prophet said my new birth didn't
[49:14] take the nature out of me to want a
[49:17] hunt my brother how back are grinning at
[49:19] me he didn't take it out of him he loved
[49:22] to
[49:23] hunt right that's just the way it
[49:27] is I I love to make a
[49:31] garden cuz I was born and rais pl of mu
[49:36] well that's all I
[49:39] know but it still holds on I love to see
[49:41] stuff
[49:43] grow you
[49:45] know but you see it didn't change me
[49:48] when I got born
[49:49] again I still love to hunt and
[49:54] fish and see my my nature is kind of on
[49:57] a a lighter side of comis I guess you'd
[50:00] call it being
[50:03] comical because that's just part of me
[50:06] but if You' have known me up until I was
[50:07] 16 years old you'd know the
[50:10] difference I used to I couldn't look you
[50:12] in the
[50:14] face I was so embarrassed I talked look
[50:17] it
[50:19] away but see something happened one day
[50:22] not even my conversion to do that I made
[50:25] up my mind you know
[50:27] what he ain't nobody in this world no
[50:30] better than I
[50:33] am I made up my
[50:36] mind I might have plowed an old mule ate
[50:40] beans and ters but they ain't nobody no
[50:43] better than I am but you know
[50:46] what now that I'm born again I think
[50:48] everybody's a whole lot better than I
[50:51] am cuz it changed that part about me
[50:56] we see children kids young girls and
[50:59] boys ain't nobody know better than you
[51:04] are somebody make fun of you go up and
[51:07] hug their
[51:08] neck and say I love
[51:14] you show them something within
[51:17] you as an individual right we sure
[51:21] change a lot of things that's right I
[51:23] get on this and get slowed on but
[51:28] listen God is working on that
[51:32] soul to get that Soul saved let's read
[51:35] some of the things the prophet had to
[51:36] say the go ahead brother we got these
[51:40] and we'll we don't have to give the
[51:42] numbers but some of you that are holding
[51:43] the notes you'll see number one on your
[51:46] thing but look what he says in the end
[51:49] time evangelism 62 uh
[51:53] 603 Jesus said you must be born again
[51:55] again in in order to be born again it's
[51:57] letting yourself go and die and the
[52:00] spirit of Christ come into you then
[52:03] you're no more yours is Christ in you
[52:06] see the Holy Spirit Paul said I Die
[52:09] daily yet I live not I but Christ liveth
[52:12] in
[52:13] me see what is the soul then see that's
[52:17] the part I'm trying to talk
[52:20] to to get away from your memories your
[52:23] reasonings your factors and speak to
[52:26] that inward part of
[52:29] you that inward part that when you go
[52:39] home I used to I've told you about it
[52:41] and I don't tell it to be nothing just
[52:43] TR
[52:45] truth if I have stayed with God when I
[52:48] saw him in about 11 years
[52:50] old it been a lot of
[52:52] difference but I didn't I was taken away
[52:55] from that by the world and the things of
[52:57] life but even as a sinner because I
[53:01] never even claimed salvation whatsoever
[53:03] in the Baptist until my wife and I were
[53:05] married and that was 1958 which I'd been
[53:07] 18 years
[53:09] old I'd go out and do things
[53:12] wrong and I'd feel sorry for
[53:16] it because it was a
[53:19] remembrance of a
[53:24] god
[53:27] a totem pole people they they have a
[53:30] remembrance of a God and they'll take a
[53:32] baby and feed it to an alligator to try
[53:34] to appease that
[53:36] God there a remembrance of you that's
[53:38] that soul of you that's that part of you
[53:41] that's longing to be
[53:46] saved see all you got to do is touch
[53:51] that and just touch that with the
[53:53] thoughts of God
[53:56] then what you need to do is let yourself
[53:58] go and
[54:02] die just say
[54:05] Lord I'm
[54:08] sorry how many of you ever done that
[54:10] this they said Lord I'm
[54:13] sorry there must be a
[54:16] God I never had any thoughts that there
[54:18] was never a
[54:21] God because I had met God
[54:26] I'd experienced something that I didn't
[54:27] ever call everybody would call after new
[54:30] birth I can Mark the Spot he was
[54:32] standing
[54:35] old and about 10 or 11 years
[54:39] old I wanted somebody to get me to that
[54:47] God but everybody I talk to about it
[54:49] they'd say you need to go to a
[54:51] Pentecostal Church you need to do this
[54:53] you need to do that they didn't
[54:56] understand I had met a god that was
[55:01] alive you said well how come you thought
[55:03] that you wouldn't born again when you
[55:04] come in mess CU When that Prophet
[55:06] started talking about that God I seen
[55:09] that God dwelling in a man's
[55:15] voice I heard the words that I wanted to
[55:21] hear us Baptist talked about a god up in
[55:24] heaven one of the days we're going to
[55:25] get there if we're
[55:29] good you know but he talked to a god
[55:32] living down here that was longing to
[55:36] fellowship with
[55:40] you God created man for Fellowship he
[55:44] wanted to come down and be with us amen
[55:48] what he did come we killed him you see I
[55:50] didn't do it if you'd have been there
[55:52] you would have so just shut up on that
[55:54] part
[55:56] you think there's some holy pie
[55:57] something wouldn't have done we would
[55:59] have done exactly how come we doing it
[56:00] now that's
[56:06] right I believe you must be born again
[56:08] to have eternal
[56:11] life I believe you must receive the life
[56:14] of Jesus Christ to come and live in your
[56:17] soul the prophet said if he can get that
[56:19] soul to stand still long enough he said
[56:21] it'll
[56:23] die
[56:26] see because that's what's wrong with
[56:28] people there's so much shout Glory
[56:31] Hallelujah I believe in never been that
[56:33] I love
[56:35] it I can talk about the presence of God
[56:38] to even smell him until he would be so
[56:46] close but yet you got to have a personal
[56:50] experience that's right in that Soul
[56:53] part of you amen
[56:55] look what he says on the future
[56:57] home go ahead with the next
[57:05] one sorry for being a little emotional
[57:08] but I love
[57:10] him and I want to see you
[57:13] saved what you think about
[57:16] me we'll put that in the sea of
[57:20] forgetfulness it may take a while to get
[57:22] it there I'm on honest I'm a human
[57:26] being but it'll be put there look what
[57:29] he says you remember the Bible said if
[57:32] that Soul won't do as he did said do he
[57:35] will even destroy that
[57:39] soul but you see he can't destroy
[57:41] himself and remain God so if that soul
[57:44] is of the world it has to be
[57:48] destroyed and one day it will be if
[57:50] we're not born
[57:52] again but if it's eternal
[57:58] with God it never did begin what the
[58:00] eternal life never did begin the soul
[58:02] begun when you were a
[58:06] baby because it's a part of God it can
[58:08] never be destroyed amen what a beautiful
[58:10] how how thankful that the church ought
[58:12] to be to see
[58:16] that to see that you could be born again
[58:18] and become
[58:20] Eternal but we're taught in the message
[58:22] by everybody and that's why those false
[58:24] doctrines that's law and Grace will get
[58:27] more on I come into the world with
[58:29] eternal life well if you did Jesus
[58:32] Christ died in vain right come on that's
[58:36] worse than the
[58:37] Pharisees
[58:39] amen but you see that's what we believe
[58:41] because it's what somebody taught us
[58:43] they taught it to our
[58:46] intellect and that Soul has become
[58:50] perverted I say a while ago the baby's
[58:53] made perfect body spirit and
[58:55] soul not Eternal but
[58:59] perfect and then we perverted
[59:04] it oh I've done everything I could to
[59:06] save my
[59:08] kids come on it's like I've told some of
[59:10] you you wanted to pray for your kids to
[59:13] get here and you got your kids here and
[59:14] then you started laying out yeah there
[59:16] you go
[59:17] amen am I
[59:20] mean or is that the
[59:23] truth maybe the reason your kids is not
[59:26] in this church today is because of you
[59:28] I'd go to my kids and apologize to them
[59:31] yes sir amen that's right they don't
[59:33] listen to me we'll write them a
[59:38] letter I ain't going to apologize my
[59:40] kids I've done the best I could that's a
[59:42] religious hypocrite Pharisee get mad at
[59:45] me and do what you want to I'm
[59:48] tired I'm through with playing sugar
[59:51] tits if you're going to stay here you're
[59:53] going to hear it straight from now on
[59:54] but with the greatest love that I could
[59:56] ever
[1:00:00] have let me scream till I die my voice
[1:00:03] out you got to be born
[1:00:07] again going to church is
[1:00:10] wonderful if you're not born
[1:00:15] again
[1:00:18] see let's look what he says on souls in
[1:00:23] prison paragraph
[1:00:27] 36 see we're we're we're brought up and
[1:00:30] we've been taught throughout the message
[1:00:32] the soul is just the nature of the
[1:00:33] spirit there is no quote for that there
[1:00:37] is no quote that the soul is just the
[1:00:38] nature of the spirit that was added by a
[1:00:40] man that was producing a Doctrine right
[1:00:44] the quote is the soul is the nature of
[1:00:46] the
[1:00:46] spirit cuz when he said the soul is just
[1:00:49] the nature of the spirit you're just
[1:00:51] making it anything it's just the nature
[1:00:53] of something it's just a you know it's
[1:00:55] not a real
[1:00:57] being but when you say the soul is the
[1:00:59] nature of the
[1:01:00] spirit now you can have the Holy Spirit
[1:01:03] is being a
[1:01:04] being do you believe that do you believe
[1:01:07] the holy spirit is a being that is the
[1:01:09] being of
[1:01:11] God the only way you can be saved is
[1:01:13] have that being to come in and
[1:01:18] live not just a Doctrine an idea a
[1:01:22] quote now the soul of man is not not the
[1:01:24] body of man it's the
[1:01:27] soul and the soul is something that's
[1:01:30] the nature of the
[1:01:32] spirit cuz that's exactly right and then
[1:01:36] when the nature of a man in other words
[1:01:37] we it's
[1:01:40] nature when he said we are dead well we
[1:01:42] would agree with
[1:01:44] that because until you're born again you
[1:01:47] are dead you know people they don't want
[1:01:49] to
[1:01:50] die right now Ain talking about
[1:01:53] physically yeah they don't want to die
[1:01:55] but the Bible tells you you were born
[1:01:59] dead why worry about what you want to be
[1:02:01] you already are dead we're just not dead
[1:02:06] enough cuz we ain't dead to the right
[1:02:09] things we need to be dead to ourselves
[1:02:12] that's right see and when he said we're
[1:02:14] dead the scripture plainly tells us we
[1:02:16] are dead and our lives in his are hidden
[1:02:18] God through Christ sealed out by the
[1:02:21] Holy
[1:02:21] Spirit now it wasn't that your body
[1:02:25] died y I want you it wasn't your spirit
[1:02:34] died Ezekiel didn't say I give you a new
[1:02:36] heart and a new spirit because you
[1:02:38] did it's a conversion working on the
[1:02:42] body Spirit soul of
[1:02:45] mankind it wasn't your spirit it was the
[1:02:47] nature of your spirit died see the
[1:02:49] nature which is the
[1:02:51] soul amen well it's just nature or
[1:02:56] something that's where the wrong is at
[1:02:59] see it's just a bird dog chases
[1:03:06] Birds
[1:03:09] right a cow dog will chase
[1:03:12] cows you know how to train a bird dog to
[1:03:15] point you know that how many of you ever
[1:03:18] seen bird dogs you don't have to train
[1:03:20] them to point I never did understand
[1:03:22] with them little bitty fellas they walk
[1:03:24] out there and they see Mama and they
[1:03:25] walk up and Mama you just go they
[1:03:29] go they don't know what they're doing
[1:03:31] but they just doing what Mama but you
[1:03:33] know one day you turn him loose out in
[1:03:34] the field he finds a bird and he
[1:03:37] goes it may be a a brown threr or maybe
[1:03:41] anything cuz he don't know the
[1:03:43] difference until he
[1:03:46] learns but you know there's one thing
[1:03:48] that all dogs will
[1:03:50] do you know what that
[1:03:53] is all dogs will chase
[1:03:56] cars it's a lot of them kill cuz that's
[1:04:00] just part of it they're born with that
[1:04:02] nature
[1:04:03] look it wasn't your body that died it
[1:04:06] wasn't your spirit that
[1:04:07] died the nature which is the soul now
[1:04:11] watch here's the quote see it's just the
[1:04:14] nature of the Soul here's the quote look
[1:04:17] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:04:22] born again right right
[1:04:27] if not if it's not it's of the
[1:04:31] world and you don't hear that by the two
[1:04:33] Soul peoples and the people quoting
[1:04:36] see the nature of your
[1:04:38] soul if you're born again is of
[1:04:41] God but if not it's of the
[1:04:44] world cuz you can't be no high gray area
[1:04:47] half in between right you're either born
[1:04:50] again or you're not born again that's
[1:04:52] right you're either a white bird or a
[1:04:54] black bird right that's not throwing on
[1:04:58] human ey talking
[1:05:00] fleshly
[1:05:02] listen anything that begin has to end so
[1:05:07] therefore the only way that you can have
[1:05:09] eternal life is to have a life that
[1:05:11] never did begin and then your life did
[1:05:14] begin when you were born when God
[1:05:18] breathed the breath of life into your
[1:05:20] nostrils and you became a living soul
[1:05:24] then you begin
[1:05:26] then a little
[1:05:30] baby just breathe into there and they
[1:05:32] become a living
[1:05:33] Soul you know what's so odd about it is
[1:05:36] what I
[1:05:39] love every one of those little babies is
[1:05:44] different identical
[1:05:48] twins right look Alik so perfect you
[1:05:52] ain't tell the difference but there's
[1:05:53] always a little difference in that's
[1:05:56] right sister Trudy or somebody had a
[1:05:59] magazine years ago you've seen those odd
[1:06:01] freak things happened to where that they
[1:06:02] would be just one part of a body this
[1:06:05] picture was was was two little girls and
[1:06:07] they were 12 13 14 years old or
[1:06:09] something two bodies up here but only
[1:06:12] down here was just one set of legs and
[1:06:15] things but two entirely different Head
[1:06:17] Shoulders everything and one of those
[1:06:19] little girls like boys and the other one
[1:06:22] didn't you see that's is silly
[1:06:26] no we're all
[1:06:29] different because you see God made us
[1:06:32] that a
[1:06:34] way he made us the way he wanted us we
[1:06:39] perverted what he
[1:06:40] made but he made us the way he wanted
[1:06:43] us that's a beautiful
[1:06:48] story what about it
[1:06:51] Church the nature of your well I didn't
[1:06:53] know I talked to a man up in
[1:06:55] Jeffersonville and I he was talking
[1:06:57] about the two Soul Doctrine and he
[1:06:59] talking about Soul just the nature of
[1:07:00] spirit I said that's not correct tried
[1:07:02] to show him what the prophet had said
[1:07:03] and I said have you ever read in souls
[1:07:05] in prison where brother BR said the
[1:07:06] nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:07:07] born again if not it's of the world he
[1:07:09] said how can you have two
[1:07:13] Natures I said why don't you go ask the
[1:07:17] prophet you know I mean that's all I
[1:07:20] said to him cuz I have no more to talk
[1:07:21] to him about he couldn't understand what
[1:07:24] talking about he wasn't going to believe
[1:07:24] what the prophet said so he's denying
[1:07:26] what he
[1:07:28] said so I just didn't care look what he
[1:07:31] said let's go on now just a little but
[1:07:34] remember the nature of your soul is God
[1:07:35] if you're born again if not it's of the
[1:07:37] world so we got one nature or the other
[1:07:39] living inside of us if the nature of the
[1:07:42] world is inside of us it's going to do
[1:07:43] the things of the world there's where
[1:07:45] you cut in your hair and you paint in
[1:07:46] your face and you dress and your shorts
[1:07:48] and your clothes and the men and all of
[1:07:49] the hoopaloo goes for that yep because
[1:07:53] it's the nature of the
[1:07:56] world but look what he says here in
[1:07:58] 1961 when they ask him says please
[1:08:01] explain this is question and answer
[1:08:04] 61 paragraph 159 he says please explain
[1:08:07] the difference between the spirit and
[1:08:08] the
[1:08:13] Soul now the Bible what is Hebrews
[1:08:17] 4:12 I paraphrase it so if I miss it
[1:08:20] just to hire you read it it says that
[1:08:23] the spirit can divide between the
[1:08:24] difference between Soul and Spirit and
[1:08:27] joint and
[1:08:30] Mira see only the Des scripture as I
[1:08:33] said if you go in the Bible and you look
[1:08:35] up Spirit it'll give you a definition of
[1:08:39] that word you look up Soul it'll give
[1:08:41] you the same definition now you you know
[1:08:43] that you've looked it up
[1:08:45] right the only way you can decide what
[1:08:48] it's talking about is to find the
[1:08:50] context or thought that it's in right
[1:08:53] and then then you can see what it's
[1:08:54] talking about amen other than that you
[1:08:56] got the same
[1:08:59] definition all right but now
[1:09:02] watch well he said now that's a hard one
[1:09:05] but as I said Hebrews 4:12 said that
[1:09:07] Spirit can divide between Soul and
[1:09:09] Spirit and joint and miror it can tell
[1:09:12] you the
[1:09:13] difference in your soul and your
[1:09:17] spirit if that Soul within
[1:09:20] you will keep on agreeing with the word
[1:09:23] is got to be of
[1:09:26] God but if it stops agreeing with the
[1:09:29] word it's of the devil I don't care how
[1:09:31] much it's agreed up to if it ever stops
[1:09:34] agreeing it's the
[1:09:36] devil it's your old adamic nature that
[1:09:39] old husband we talking about this
[1:09:41] morning that's still
[1:09:44] alive he's still married to it because
[1:09:48] you're connected to
[1:09:50] it now that's a hard one but the first
[1:09:52] thing you are trying being just like
[1:09:54] Father Son and Holy Ghost now look at
[1:09:56] the prophet could take father son Holy
[1:09:57] Ghost about one God and explain a person
[1:10:00] or take a person of a body spirit and
[1:10:02] soul and describe
[1:10:04] God see because the spirit divides the
[1:10:07] difference the word reveal will to tell
[1:10:10] you what that soul is inside of you amen
[1:10:12] how do I know what I'm born
[1:10:16] again let me talk to you a little while
[1:10:18] we'll find
[1:10:20] out let me Rake you over the Cs about
[1:10:22] something
[1:10:27] and you sit there in body and say man I
[1:10:29] tell you what I'm hating this cuz I'm
[1:10:32] getting chewed out and I can't get up
[1:10:35] because he won't let me stand up and say
[1:10:37] nothing
[1:10:39] right but then on the inside of
[1:10:41] something
[1:10:42] says you know you already to listen to
[1:10:44] what the man's
[1:10:46] saying you know that might just be your
[1:10:48] spirit
[1:10:49] real but then after a while something
[1:10:51] says you know what he told me the truth
[1:10:55] you remember the lady that said brother
[1:10:56] brandham called her a a what was a
[1:10:59] vulture she said brother brandham called
[1:11:01] me a
[1:11:02] buzzard other lady said he called me an
[1:11:06] eagle According to which one you
[1:11:07] listening
[1:11:10] to one of them will show you of God and
[1:11:12] the other show you're
[1:11:14] not I guess we'll get on to what the
[1:11:16] soul is
[1:11:19] anyway we see like father son Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] three titles go into the one person
[1:11:24] which is Jesus Christ and you're soul
[1:11:27] body Spirit but it takes those three to
[1:11:29] make you with just one of them you're
[1:11:32] not
[1:11:33] you one by yourself you're not
[1:11:36] you all right I I want this whole
[1:11:40] being to agree with the word what about
[1:11:43] you I want my whole being to be involved
[1:11:47] in in in the
[1:11:49] word the word that that my decisions is
[1:11:52] made from that
[1:11:55] right and and we know we live
[1:11:59] humanly this doesn't do away with with
[1:12:01] living as a human
[1:12:03] beings and being
[1:12:05] people just because you're a Christian
[1:12:07] doesn't make you
[1:12:09] odd being a Christian you're
[1:12:10] automatically
[1:12:12] odd you don't have to make
[1:12:14] nothing you just do what the word says
[1:12:17] right us men we walk through Walmart and
[1:12:20] then nobody say there goes a Christian
[1:12:23] right they don't never walk up to you
[1:12:25] hey you're Christian cuz
[1:12:29] you don't never say
[1:12:32] that
[1:12:33] right but they walk around to the
[1:12:36] sisters and look at them and
[1:12:38] say you must be a
[1:12:41] Christian amen right well because they
[1:12:43] can see something I old men were just
[1:12:45] nothing anyway make no difference that's
[1:12:47] why with the ugly part of the side of
[1:12:50] it that's why it's it's a wife of a
[1:12:53] bride that God is coming back after that
[1:12:56] he's concerned
[1:12:58] with a people you all right takes those
[1:13:01] three to make you just one of them not
[1:13:04] you it takes a three to make you like I
[1:13:06] said the other day this is my hand this
[1:13:08] is my
[1:13:09] finger this is my nose this is my
[1:13:12] eyes but who's
[1:13:17] me right who's
[1:13:21] me who is me
[1:13:23] that this belongs
[1:13:26] to who is me that what all you see
[1:13:28] belongs
[1:13:32] to and we know the Plan of Salvation
[1:13:35] that these bodies will be redeemed right
[1:13:38] but you know God didn't
[1:13:40] die to just save our bodies amen
[1:13:46] right he died to save our
[1:13:51] soul he died that that Soul could have
[1:13:54] an
[1:13:55] opportunity Hey listen I've said this
[1:13:59] and I mean it from the bottom of my
[1:14:00] heart if I die and go to
[1:14:03] hell I want to see my family have an
[1:14:08] opportunity the reason I preach
[1:14:11] today I don't have to preach to be
[1:14:15] saved that has nothing to do with it but
[1:14:19] the reason I preach is to try to save
[1:14:21] your soul amen I want you to have an
[1:14:24] opportunity not to just be left at the
[1:14:27] hand dogs of this message preachers that
[1:14:29] are screaming holler their doctrines and
[1:14:32] run you all over the
[1:14:34] country I want you to have a
[1:14:37] change to see
[1:14:41] God I don't even talk about the things
[1:14:44] he he's done in my
[1:14:47] life some of you never heard what I said
[1:14:50] what I go about before that I saw God
[1:14:52] when I was was 11 years old cuz I don't
[1:14:54] get every Ser I seen God you got to come
[1:14:57] to me I seen
[1:14:58] God every service I don't tell you that
[1:15:01] I saw three times an
[1:15:04] angel a man standing in the
[1:15:08] room till the first time I seen it I
[1:15:10] grabbed a 357 and went after
[1:15:13] him that's how real it
[1:15:17] was but that ain't going to save you
[1:15:20] that's
[1:15:22] right
[1:15:24] you put your thoughts on that it ain't
[1:15:26] going to save
[1:15:28] you it's that
[1:15:31] word let me anchor that word let me
[1:15:34] preach that
[1:15:35] word amen until you can at least make a
[1:15:41] decision you got a choice I refused for
[1:15:44] years to open up this to an internet
[1:15:49] system I did you know that we started is
[1:15:53] sending out
[1:15:54] tapes it become so popular we were
[1:15:56] sending out $300 worth a
[1:15:59] month to paying for Foreign Fields to
[1:16:02] get the message to
[1:16:03] them cuz everybody wanted to hear and
[1:16:06] they said brother Dale let us get your
[1:16:08] tapes I said I can't do it cuz you got
[1:16:10] to get your pastor to okay it and the
[1:16:13] pastors wouldn't okay
[1:16:15] it some of them that was your pastors at
[1:16:17] that
[1:16:18] time wouldn't
[1:16:21] okay them to listen to what I was
[1:16:23] saying so one day I said God what can I
[1:16:28] do Richard Joe some of them here kept on
[1:16:32] and said wait them open it up
[1:16:36] Daddy go to the Internet with it at
[1:16:39] least they can
[1:16:41] hear I opened it up started on the
[1:16:44] internet
[1:16:45] system wonderful now at least some
[1:16:48] people can hear I'm not the internet
[1:16:50] pastor and I never will be I've had to
[1:16:53] write me notes and say we want to know
[1:16:55] about the answer to this question I said
[1:16:56] I refuse to answer your questions I am
[1:16:59] not your pastor I've even had pastors to
[1:17:02] do it there back I can tell you pastors
[1:17:04] would write and say I'm a pastor and I
[1:17:06] want to know I said I will not answer
[1:17:08] you go to the message but I will tell
[1:17:12] you I preached the Ser on
[1:17:14] that that's up to them to go to the
[1:17:17] series you know all right but listen I'm
[1:17:22] trying to deal with your soul who is me
[1:17:26] that these things belongs
[1:17:29] to who am
[1:17:31] I that the king would die
[1:17:36] for who are we that God would come from
[1:17:40] Glory right
[1:17:42] amen and give his
[1:17:47] life then in the message I just argue
[1:17:49] over whether it was a man or
[1:17:52] not
[1:17:53] brother brother said no man ever died
[1:17:55] like that man said ain't no man could
[1:17:57] die that way said sure he was a man in
[1:18:00] body but said they wouldn't no man like
[1:18:02] that man said he was God in human flesh
[1:18:07] amen but yet some of you had rather hear
[1:18:11] and rejoice over what you hear of some
[1:18:13] of what is said by some of these out
[1:18:15] there than to listen to the
[1:18:17] truth I'm not responsible for
[1:18:20] that I'm responsible right here
[1:18:23] to try to tell you and let you
[1:18:25] read
[1:18:27] see it's what's on the inside of me
[1:18:31] that's the intelligence that's it
[1:18:34] brother Brown said you've never seen
[1:18:36] me he said you see the body I
[1:18:40] inhabit that's right and you know I can
[1:18:41] deceive every one of
[1:18:43] you
[1:18:46] right but I can't deceive
[1:18:50] myself and I can make everybody in here
[1:18:52] think I'm a CH
[1:18:54] Christian but there's an intelligence
[1:18:57] intelligence inside of
[1:19:01] me that's telling me what I
[1:19:04] am okay if this eye if this hand if this
[1:19:08] body could body
[1:19:10] should body stood here just as it is
[1:19:14] today yet I could my body could be here
[1:19:17] but me could be gone what I am whatever
[1:19:21] I am inside of me is going on that's the
[1:19:25] part part that is the spirit watch the
[1:19:28] soul is the nature of that
[1:19:33] spirit cuz come on
[1:19:36] folks whatever is in the inside of you
[1:19:39] whether you want to call it Soul or you
[1:19:41] want to call it spirit that is the
[1:19:43] motivating factor of you it's working
[1:19:46] outwardly we try to work inwardly right
[1:19:50] we want people to quit this and quit
[1:19:52] that
[1:19:54] well don't you think you ought to preach
[1:19:55] to the
[1:19:57] women get them lined up well what are
[1:20:00] you trying to say is your wife worthy of
[1:20:03] the Gospel is that what you're trying to
[1:20:04] say I've heard preachers you have two
[1:20:07] preach an hour and a half two hour
[1:20:09] sermon or trying to line up
[1:20:13] women I think they ought to line them up
[1:20:17] I don't make no
[1:20:20] jokes when I hear a man say something
[1:20:23] there any problem with me repeating
[1:20:24] him and the man said I didn't have
[1:20:27] nothing
[1:20:28] today said and I went down to
[1:20:32] Wallmart and I got a
[1:20:37] sermon well he didn't preach on the
[1:20:39] price of eggs or
[1:20:41] clothes or
[1:20:44] lawnmowers he preached on
[1:20:47] women and how they
[1:20:50] looked well what was he looking at
[1:20:55] you know come
[1:20:58] on if all you preach on is women you
[1:21:01] preach on split dresses you know
[1:21:06] what well she got a little
[1:21:08] split and going a longer split boy
[1:21:11] that's way
[1:21:17] up I wonder what's wrong with
[1:21:21] people I thought brother brandom said
[1:21:23] that was my sister am that's right don't
[1:21:27] you relate me to them slip down dressed
[1:21:30] women and call them my sisters if they
[1:21:32] get born again what are
[1:21:37] they come
[1:21:41] on but you see then I don't agree with
[1:21:43] all in splits and things because I'm
[1:21:46] trying to tell you in the correct way
[1:21:48] that if you act like that you're lost if
[1:21:50] you wear them clothes you're want
[1:21:52] somebody to lust after
[1:21:55] you if my daughter is split and run out
[1:21:58] on the world and went out there naked
[1:22:00] and all running around and she'd have
[1:22:02] called me and said Daddy there's a boy
[1:22:03] over here insulting me I'd have went
[1:22:05] over there and I'd have said Son get
[1:22:08] on get out of here I'd have protected
[1:22:11] her as a daddy but I'd have turned
[1:22:13] around and told her you were the one
[1:22:15] that caused him to lust after you
[1:22:17] that's so you caused
[1:22:21] it that's right
[1:22:23] come on so you don't want me to preach
[1:22:24] on clothes and hir and
[1:22:26] dress cuz I get too plain right I get
[1:22:30] down where we live
[1:22:31] at
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:36] watch that's that's the part part that
[1:22:39] is the spirit the soul is the nature of
[1:22:41] that spirit and when the Holy Spirit
[1:22:43] comes upon you it does not do
[1:22:50] nothing oh
[1:22:54] listen to the rest of
[1:22:55] it you it changes or converts your
[1:23:00] spirit to a different
[1:23:07] soul
[1:23:11] what it
[1:23:15] converts converts means you change from
[1:23:18] one form to another I thought or of
[1:23:20] misst understanding of the word convert
[1:23:22] or
[1:23:24] saved it converts your spirit to a
[1:23:27] different
[1:23:29] soul and that soul is a different nature
[1:23:32] that's on that Spirit right see so the
[1:23:35] soul is controlling the spirit the
[1:23:37] spirit controls the
[1:23:42] body
[1:23:46] right so the soul is the nature of your
[1:23:51] spirit well it's just the nature of
[1:23:54] something no it's the nature of what it
[1:23:57] is a bird dog is a bird dog you don't
[1:24:01] expect a bird dog to chase
[1:24:04] cows he's not trained for
[1:24:07] that you see somebody that can't control
[1:24:10] herself they're
[1:24:12] a got the wrong nature inside of
[1:24:15] them right come
[1:24:18] on it's your nature it's the difference
[1:24:21] let's see first you were mean and evil
[1:24:23] and hatred hatred and Malice and strife
[1:24:26] now you're loving sweet
[1:24:30] kind there's the
[1:24:34] difference it's your
[1:24:36] nature I I I'll call it that it's your
[1:24:39] soul that's been
[1:24:41] changed I believe in that but I don't
[1:24:44] believe in
[1:24:48] exchange I've heard preachers read that
[1:24:51] and say exchange instead of to
[1:24:55] change you exchange you take out
[1:24:57] something put something in the place of
[1:24:58] it but if you change
[1:25:02] it he's still working on me it's just
[1:25:06] something he's doing right look what he
[1:25:08] said the old soul
[1:25:11] died you remember the quote before then
[1:25:13] now it wasn't your body that died it
[1:25:16] wasn't your spirit that died it was the
[1:25:18] nature of your
[1:25:21] soul
[1:25:22] right the old soul died and the new Soul
[1:25:25] which is in your nature was born into
[1:25:27] you that's the life of Christ your brain
[1:25:31] is not your
[1:25:33] intelligence right
[1:25:36] right come on now it's your spirit
[1:25:39] that's in you is your intelligence so
[1:25:41] your brain is a bunch of matter and
[1:25:42] cells and so forth it has no
[1:25:44] intelligence in itself if it did then as
[1:25:47] long as it laid there whether you was
[1:25:50] dead or alive it would still operate see
[1:25:53] but it's not it's not your brain it's
[1:25:56] your spirit inside of you and your soul
[1:25:59] is the nature of that Spirit that's the
[1:26:02] soul of the spirit that
[1:26:05] controls the spirit that controls the
[1:26:08] body seat there you
[1:26:11] are what is
[1:26:14] it that new birth comes in and starts
[1:26:18] working from the inside
[1:26:21] out
[1:26:23] right let's get one
[1:26:29] more go ahead to souls in prison
[1:26:32] paragraph 42 let's get a couple more and
[1:26:33] then we'll quit we'll just make this
[1:26:36] part of the
[1:26:37] message then we'll continue on that old
[1:26:40] husband cuz that's what I'm talking
[1:26:41] about our old husband is our old
[1:26:44] nature and that old husband has got to
[1:26:46] be dead that's right not just divorced
[1:26:50] not just left him well I don't act like
[1:26:52] that anymore I know I'd like
[1:26:57] to
[1:27:00] right brother around said you take a man
[1:27:02] that's a drunk and he gets
[1:27:06] converted if that nature don't go away
[1:27:09] don't pice a bottle under his
[1:27:11] nose right right Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:27:15] can car you so far but they can't
[1:27:17] convert
[1:27:20] you used to smoke
[1:27:25] and you still have the desires or
[1:27:26] thoughts of that now let me explain that
[1:27:30] one many of you have heard me explain my
[1:27:33] life over and over I guess cuz that's
[1:27:35] all I can talk about is
[1:27:38] myself that ain't the right way to say
[1:27:40] that but I'm the only one I know about
[1:27:44] okay not just talking about
[1:27:47] myself I I never did
[1:27:50] drink I just didn't want to
[1:27:54] I've explained to you privately what it
[1:27:56] looked like to
[1:27:57] me and I don't like
[1:27:59] it I used to smoke a little bit oh yeah
[1:28:02] we were all kids come on kids everybody
[1:28:04] wants to off on the kids they want the
[1:28:05] kids to get so converted and make
[1:28:07] everything so great you know why don't
[1:28:09] you act like me if you acted like me you
[1:28:11] know what you'd done you'd have done
[1:28:12] what I
[1:28:13] done I had a 56 Chet 55 56 is one we
[1:28:18] have every little boy had up over the
[1:28:21] Sun
[1:28:23] visor a
[1:28:26] pipe mine never got burned enough to
[1:28:28] even get to
[1:28:29] taste CU I didn't care about
[1:28:33] it but you know what then after I got
[1:28:35] born
[1:28:39] again and I never did have a bad mouth
[1:28:42] to cush I like my teeth in my face you
[1:28:45] know don't look too good but I wanted it
[1:28:48] to stay
[1:28:49] together and I never cussed and stuff
[1:28:51] like that cuz it was
[1:28:53] just why I told a man at work one day
[1:28:56] he's cussing like I said you ain't got
[1:28:57] nothing he had a college education I
[1:28:59] said you ain't got nothing with a bird
[1:29:02] brain he said I'll feed you the Lions
[1:29:04] one day that's all
[1:29:06] right well I said you ain't got nothing
[1:29:08] but a bird bra you can teach a bird how
[1:29:09] to cuss say something without
[1:29:13] cussing see it makes you look like
[1:29:15] you're
[1:29:17] big every word there's one down there a
[1:29:20] guy that comes in there the shop he
[1:29:23] can't say nothing unless he cusses take
[1:29:26] his cussing out and you would have but
[1:29:27] three
[1:29:29] words hi how you doing
[1:29:32] bye come on
[1:29:34] folks I just didn't do them
[1:29:37] things that didn't make me a
[1:29:41] Christian I just didn't want to do
[1:29:46] it but yet when I got
[1:29:50] converted and I i' walk up and somebody
[1:29:53] would maybe be smoking a
[1:29:55] cigarette and that old booger says don't
[1:29:57] that smell
[1:30:03] good come on I'm honest I don't I don't
[1:30:06] lie to you see somebody drinking and
[1:30:10] they we had a hunting camp together and
[1:30:13] some guys dranked at it and Wade was
[1:30:15] worried about it I said just tell him to
[1:30:17] make sure and give me a drct
[1:30:19] pepper cuz I didn't want my mouth water
[1:30:22] and over their liquor because it was
[1:30:23] liquid that was main thing you could
[1:30:25] have doubt me well water done just as
[1:30:28] good but get what I'm
[1:30:31] saying and you know that even I would
[1:30:34] start to
[1:30:35] talk and a dirty word would come into my
[1:30:38] thought that I'd have to stop from
[1:30:39] saying
[1:30:42] it he said Brother D after you're born
[1:30:44] again yes cuz that booger will get on
[1:30:47] that shoulder he's trying his best to
[1:30:49] break you if he can do it he's got
[1:30:54] you but you got to keep saying I
[1:30:57] wouldn't do it if I
[1:31:00] could oh I don't mind talking
[1:31:05] pling I wouldn't drink if I was on a
[1:31:07] desert island by myself but I'm honest
[1:31:10] if they wasn't nothing else to drink I
[1:31:12] ain't going to starve to
[1:31:15] death I'm not
[1:31:20] stupid come on
[1:31:22] on why can't we be honest that's
[1:31:26] right are you just too honest well okay
[1:31:28] I'm too honest but at least tell it to
[1:31:31] you like it is Lord have mercy mercy so
[1:31:36] let Lord help
[1:31:40] us all right listen to what he
[1:31:43] says off of souls in prison paragraph 42
[1:31:47] then see after he done made man in his
[1:31:49] own image created he them male and
[1:31:51] female M there was no man to tell the
[1:31:53] soil and he put him in the dust of the
[1:31:54] earth and therefore became he was that
[1:31:56] man this human man was mammal see he was
[1:31:59] animal but he put this spirit of God
[1:32:02] alive into him and made him on the bases
[1:32:06] that he could make a
[1:32:08] choice and then when this
[1:32:11] man see when he made the
[1:32:15] choice look what he goes on to say but
[1:32:18] that Soul that's in their
[1:32:20] sea that soul is what God is working
[1:32:24] on he's not working on your body he's
[1:32:27] not working on your
[1:32:28] spirit he's working on your
[1:32:31] soul if he can only get that nature that
[1:32:35] Spirit to agree with him then that
[1:32:38] nature
[1:32:41] dies
[1:32:43] right and the nature of the love of the
[1:32:45] world dies and the things of the world
[1:32:47] is dead see because if you love the
[1:32:49] world the things of the world the love
[1:32:50] of God is Not In You and a man must be
[1:32:52] born again so this Nature has to die and
[1:32:55] the nature of the world comes in and
[1:32:57] lives in you and God is the only thing
[1:33:00] that there is that and no beginning and
[1:33:02] no
[1:33:04] ending you see what I'm talking about
[1:33:06] what is a soul it's what you really
[1:33:09] are it's what you really
[1:33:12] are you
[1:33:14] know and what a wonderful thing to find
[1:33:16] out what we are
[1:33:18] amen what was that that made you
[1:33:21] different
[1:33:26] right what made you not do the things of
[1:33:29] the world that other people around you
[1:33:33] done you mean I had Eternal no I didn't
[1:33:36] say that
[1:33:37] now but see God has the ability to work
[1:33:40] on people why would and I'm not throwing
[1:33:43] off on Africans anything when I say
[1:33:46] these things I'm using the terminology
[1:33:48] of the Prophet why would have taught and
[1:33:49] taught in Africa
[1:33:52] that's never heard of God of any
[1:33:54] way but yet he builds an idol and he
[1:33:58] believes that that imaginary God comes
[1:34:00] in that Idol that Idol is not his God
[1:34:04] it's an imaginary thing that connects
[1:34:06] him and he believes it and he'll feed
[1:34:08] his children to that
[1:34:10] alligator because of his
[1:34:13] sincerity that's a soul of an individual
[1:34:16] that's crying out for a
[1:34:19] God you know what I love
[1:34:22] I love the word of
[1:34:24] God you know why this Prophet say it see
[1:34:28] that's always was a burden to me is what
[1:34:30] about that hot and
[1:34:32] tot that Eskimo that person that had
[1:34:36] never heard of a
[1:34:38] god what is God going to do with
[1:34:42] them oh you just throw them all in
[1:34:46] Hell CU it got to be burned again but I
[1:34:49] agree to that but what are you going to
[1:34:52] do with
[1:34:53] that I love that quote where the Prophet
[1:34:56] come along he said God will judge them
[1:34:59] according to the way they lived under
[1:35:03] their own
[1:35:04] laws he said you go to Africa and won't
[1:35:08] find this was the old AG cuz a lot of us
[1:35:10] started there but he said you won't find
[1:35:12] one veneral
[1:35:16] disease he said a girl had to
[1:35:19] prove that she's a virgin
[1:35:22] before she can
[1:35:27] marry he said what would you do in
[1:35:30] America today in the choirs across the
[1:35:34] land but they'll be judged according to
[1:35:37] their own
[1:35:38] laws and the way they do with that law
[1:35:41] God will judge them when they never
[1:35:43] heard about Jesus Christ that is a
[1:35:46] wonderful God
[1:35:49] Amen but he said you and I will be held
[1:35:51] accountable because we didn't take the
[1:35:52] word to
[1:35:53] them
[1:35:57] right a lot of difference in it in let's
[1:36:00] stand together we're going to take the
[1:36:02] communion today Terren is one so I took
[1:36:05] part of his time cuz he'll be very
[1:36:07] short
[1:36:09] you and communion will be very short
[1:36:11] with him because that's he's short and
[1:36:13] plain and
[1:36:14] blunt I'm blunt he just short and
[1:36:19] plain anybody have a before we go into
[1:36:22] the
[1:36:24] communion cuz what I've done is got the
[1:36:26] deacons and things to serve the
[1:36:29] ministers to serve the deacons to serve
[1:36:32] because they're supposed to be able
[1:36:36] to and let them serve you because that's
[1:36:40] what they're supposed to
[1:36:42] be has anybody got any needs or anything
[1:36:44] let's just saying
[1:36:46] I love
[1:36:49] you I
[1:36:56] because he first just come and let's
[1:37:00] pray and believe before we go into the
[1:37:09] communion our sisters having a pain in
[1:37:12] their back or shoulders and trying to
[1:37:15] take her breath
[1:37:16] away so let's
[1:37:18] believe right
[1:37:21] let's believe that he
[1:37:24] is and that he
[1:37:27] heals we don't have to lay hands on our
[1:37:29] sister when she left that seat and come
[1:37:31] this way there was a spirit inside of
[1:37:32] her made a
[1:37:35] decision that Soul within her is longing
[1:37:37] to be
[1:37:38] delivered because it's not happy in a
[1:37:40] body that's
[1:37:42] sick am God wants to live in us as
[1:37:46] healthy beings so he heals
[1:37:49] us we just lay hands upon own her and
[1:37:51] believe with her right father in the
[1:37:54] name of Jesus Christ we raise our hand
[1:37:57] towards you with a sign that I Love You
[1:38:00] Lord may we always have that thought in
[1:38:03] mind and father then transmit that down
[1:38:07] to our
[1:38:09] sister that you would come down and take
[1:38:11] away this pain that's in the body and
[1:38:14] Lord use the vessel as just a
[1:38:16] transmitting ability or a thought or a
[1:38:18] touch or a
[1:38:20] contact to where that she can say by
[1:38:22] your stripes I'm
[1:38:24] Healed and the pain is gone away we
[1:38:27] condemn this hurting this cutting off
[1:38:29] the breath and all the thing we condemn
[1:38:31] it in the name of Jesus
[1:38:34] Christ and believe in your word that by
[1:38:36] your strip she's healed thank you Father
[1:38:40] we love you in Jesus name amen anybody
[1:38:45] else before we turn the services
[1:38:48] over he love him
[1:38:53] I love
[1:39:15] you want to know about his job and
[1:39:17] things and connection but that's the
[1:39:19] secondary part in this mind
[1:39:22] cuz he wants to know if he's born again
[1:39:26] amen what a greater thing could be
[1:39:28] thought
[1:39:32] about you that are born again remember
[1:39:35] the day you thought about it and
[1:39:38] wondered but then a day came that you
[1:39:40] had a pieace in your mind about
[1:39:42] it brother Mo used to call it and he had
[1:39:45] a funny way of saying things he'd say
[1:39:47] we'll pray with you and said God will
[1:39:48] give you just that little tug on your
[1:39:50] heart
[1:39:52] to let you know that all is well amen
[1:39:56] well see a tug on the heart can be a
[1:39:57] many a
[1:39:58] thing you could shout speak in tongues
[1:40:01] cry life
[1:40:03] Rejoice could be many things that could
[1:40:06] take place through that little contact
[1:40:08] of the tug of the heart but we just want
[1:40:11] God to speak right so let's just
[1:40:15] believe and as I said about sister Freda
[1:40:19] see when our brother left the office and
[1:40:21] walked down
[1:40:23] here there was a lot settled right

[1:40:32] you can't even move your hands without a
[1:40:35] spirit motivating you or leading you so

[1:40:38] believe
[1:40:40] father in the name of our Lord and

[1:40:45] asked for the greatest possession that
[1:40:48] life could ever exist of it's not

[1:40:53] all of the great things popularities and
[1:40:56] all that it's a born again experience in
[1:40:58] our hearts and our lives and we just lay
[1:41:01] our hands up on our brother believing
[1:41:03] that Lord you'll contact him right here
[1:41:06] and that you speak to his heart he's
[1:41:08] done his part he's repented he's
