[8:20] she asked me some time back when you
[8:22] sing again sing this one so
[8:25] we're in the sea
[8:29] but uh just thinking about
[8:36] this i week thinking about
[8:42] brother tom earnest passing on and
[8:45] uh
[8:49] first time i ever met brother tom we
[8:50] were in
[8:52] gainesville when brother biscuit came
[8:54] and preached at the
[8:55] meeting yeah sat across to the table
[8:58] from me
[8:58] in the minister's breakfast that's the
[9:00] first time i ever met him
[9:02] and he knew my he knew my grandmother
[9:04] sister grace
[9:05] and so we had a lot to talk about and i
[9:08] always remember
[9:09] i'll never forget of all the things i
[9:11] remember about brother tom
[9:12] was when he come here and he was talking
[9:14] about preaching too long or preaching
[9:16] too
[9:16] short or trying to know how long a
[9:19] preacher should preach
[9:20] you know brother branham said one time
[9:22] that everybody was complaining about
[9:24] you know 20 minutes is too long he said
[9:26] what you need is a good four hour sermon
[9:28] to get you some gospel vitamins and
[9:31] everything
[9:32] and i always never forget brother tom
[9:33] ernest talking about that four hour
[9:35] sermon
[9:35] and so you know you mentioned that a few
[9:37] times from the pulpit people start
[9:39] getting nervous but
[9:41] but you know the different ones that
[9:44] have
[9:45] that have passed stone and you know
[9:47] there's
[9:48] many that are still in the battle and
[9:51] you know i
[9:52] every day i i pray there's so many that
[9:55] you know battling covet and
[9:56] and different things and sister karen
[9:59] pruitt passing away and
[10:01] you know different ones and
[10:04] i was thinking about this song today and
[10:08] it's called i've never been this
[10:11] homesick before
[10:13] and and i think it really speaks to the
[10:15] day that we live in because
[10:17] you know it's the the bride has to get
[10:21] herself ready
[10:22] it has to be our desire to be ready you
[10:25] know when we get when we get to the
[10:26] place where you know
[10:27] we don't be in this pest house any
[10:30] longer you know
[10:32] because it's as brotherhood said it's
[10:35] it's desperation time
[10:36] it's it's it's for the bride to get
[10:38] desperate so amen
[10:41] if y'all know the word young help me
[10:42] singing
[10:42] [Music]

[17:07] amen amen isaiah chapter 40
[17:11] verse 25 i entitled this in the in the
[17:15] cleft of the rock
[17:18] and having having gotten to see a lot of
[17:22] mountains that i've never seen before
[17:24] never
[17:24] i'd seen the rocky mountains in pictures
[17:26] but i can say i've
[17:27] i've actually got to see them up close
[17:30] and
[17:31] there's a lot of folks here brother i'm
[17:32] talking about there's a lot of folks
[17:33] they like the beach and different things
[17:34] like that
[17:35] i can tell you i was in my element i'm a
[17:39] mountain person i
[17:40] i like the wilderness that's that's
[17:42] that's
[17:43] that's the person i am i just
[17:46] it's beautiful and if you've never been
[17:48] you ought to go but i like i told
[17:50] people i said well we got a glimpse of
[17:52] what heaven is going to be like
[17:55] but uh here in isaiah 40 verse 25
[17:59] i want you to listen to this that's what
[18:01] struck me as
[18:03] god says to whom then will ye liken me
[18:08] or who shall i be equal saith the holy
[18:12] one
[18:14] a pretty powerful statement he steps out
[18:16] there because you know what he goes
[18:17] through and you start reading about
[18:18] isaiah and all the things that have
[18:19] happened in the
[18:20] in the in israel and all the things that
[18:23] they've been through and everything like
[18:25] that but then he comes out here and he
[18:26] begins to speak about this
[18:29] you know because they chase false gods
[18:31] they've chased false doctrines they
[18:33] fought they chased all these other
[18:34] things
[18:36] but he comes back says well which one of
[18:38] them is like me
[18:40] who can be an equal to me
[18:43] you you've walked in in the world of sin
[18:45] you've done all these things but who can
[18:46] be my equal
[18:48] he says lift up your eyes on high and
[18:50] behold who has created these things that
[18:53] bringeth out their host by number
[18:55] he calleth them all by names
[18:58] by the greatness of his might for that
[19:00] he is strong in power
[19:02] not one faileth why says thou o jacob
[19:05] and speak of
[19:06] israel my way is hid from the lord and
[19:09] my judgment
[19:10] is passed over from my god
[19:13] hast thou not known hast thou not heard
[19:16] that the everlasting god the lord the
[19:19] creator
[19:20] of the ends of the earth fainteth not
[19:23] neither is weary there is no searching
[19:26] of his understanding
[19:30] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[19:34] that have no might he increa increases
[19:38] strength even the youth shall faint and
[19:41] be weary
[19:42] and the young men shall utterly fall
[19:46] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[19:48] renew their strength
[19:50] they shall mine up with wings as eagles
[19:52] they shall run and not be weary they
[19:54] shall walk
[19:55] and not faint
[19:58] and we could just stop at that and
[20:00] almost go home but
[20:03] job chapter 39 verse 27
[20:07] he says dot the eagle mount up at thy
[20:10] command
[20:11] and make her nest on high she dwelleth
[20:14] and abideth on the rock
[20:16] upon the crag of the rock and the strong
[20:19] place
[20:20] i want you to remember that and from
[20:22] hands and from fence
[20:24] she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold
[20:26] afar off
[20:27] her young ones also suck up blood
[20:30] and where the slain are there is she
[20:34] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[20:35] seated
[20:45] so and psalms 103
[20:50] it says and
[20:53] if they want to bring it up they can
[20:54] they don't have to
[20:56] but it's very familiar scripture he says
[20:59] bless the lord on my soul and all that
[21:00] is within me bless his holy name bless
[21:02] the lord on my soul and forget not all
[21:04] his benefits
[21:05] who forgiveth all thy iniquities who
[21:07] healeth all thy diseases
[21:09] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[21:11] who crown of thee with loving kindness
[21:13] and tender mercies
[21:14] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[21:17] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[21:19] eagles
[21:20] the lord executed righteousness and
[21:23] judgment
[21:24] for all that are oppressed
[21:32] so i want to speak tonight
[21:37] on the on the cleft of the rock
[21:41] and you know i was thinking about seeing
[21:43] all these
[21:45] rock structures and all these things and
[21:49] you know christ the scripture tells us
[21:52] in first corinthians that
[21:54] you know the rock was christ
[21:58] you know he said he led the children of
[22:00] israel through the wilderness
[22:03] and he said they all ate of the same
[22:05] spiritual meat
[22:06] and he said they all drank the spiritual
[22:08] drink
[22:09] he said but god was not uh
[22:13] pleased with them he said that rock
[22:15] followed them all their journey
[22:18] everything that they had neither was
[22:19] right there with them
[22:21] and they were and god was not well
[22:22] pleased because they didn't they didn't
[22:24] want by faith
[22:27] and so you know they didn't want the way
[22:29] god but god
[22:30] led them and god
[22:34] was trying to take them to a place and
[22:36] he had a place
[22:37] for them to be and for them to be
[22:39] blessed
[22:40] and yet they didn't walk the way he
[22:42] wanted them to walk
[22:44] what was given to him they didn't follow
[22:45] any of that
[22:47] but god continued to fall you know to
[22:50] lead them
[22:52] and that rock that was behind you know
[22:54] stayed right there behind them the whole
[22:55] time
[22:57] and when they became thirsty there was
[22:59] water that came out of the rock
[23:01] and everything that they had need of god
[23:03] was there to meet it
[23:06] and you know hearing the message brother
[23:09] man i'm speaking of
[23:10] israel and the church
[23:14] brother brahm says up on they come into
[23:17] the smitten rock
[23:19] he said notice when they come to the
[23:21] rock they had
[23:23] need now moses smote the rock
[23:26] with the rod that's where he we left
[23:29] last night smote the rock
[23:31] with the rod and the rod wasn't god's
[23:33] judgment and god the rod was god's
[23:35] judgment rod
[23:36] and he smoked the rock and there was a
[23:39] cleft in the left side of the rock
[23:41] where the children of israel got hungry
[23:44] there
[23:45] went they went there and a beehive
[23:48] a bee got in there and made a hive and
[23:52] they got honey out of the rock
[23:54] everything they had need of was in the
[23:56] rock
[23:57] the rock followed the church and the
[24:00] rock was christ jesus
[24:02] when they were thirsty they drank from
[24:03] the rock when they were hungry they ate
[24:05] from the rock
[24:06] wherever they went the rock followed
[24:08] them and the rocks still following the
[24:10] church
[24:11] christ is the rock that was in the
[24:13] wilderness
[24:14] notice now there's the same rock
[24:19] so the same rock is still here today
[24:23] so when they walked and they had a need
[24:24] there was a rock for them to go to
[24:28] now when we go back and look and he
[24:30] begins to speak of the eagle
[24:33] brother i'm talking about the eagle
[24:34] being in the rock and having
[24:37] and you know he said they came from the
[24:38] storm and they hid from the storm there
[24:40] was a place for them to go to
[24:42] and that's what i i liked about what job
[24:44] had to say because
[24:46] here's job talking about you know who
[24:49] allowed he said does the eagle mount up
[24:52] at thy command
[24:54] you know it wasn't it was job didn't
[24:56] have the power to control
[24:57] any of that but see god set all that in
[25:00] motion that was all that god had done
[25:02] he said she dwells she dwelleth and
[25:04] abideth on the rock
[25:07] and that rock was christ and brothers
[25:09] and sisters we're
[25:10] eagles god tightens us as eagles
[25:14] we're god's heritage so there was a rock
[25:16] that was given for you and i to stand
[25:18] on and he said for us to come to that
[25:20] rock to stand on
[25:21] so when he met their needs in the old
[25:23] testament and that rock was behind them
[25:25] and everything that they had need of
[25:27] they came to the rock
[25:28] then the thing he said that same rock
[25:30] follows us today so
[25:31] brother sisters we have a rock to come
[25:33] to a sure foundation
[25:35] and everything that we have need of is
[25:37] in that rock
[25:38] we have a rock to stand on and he has
[25:40] placed that rock before us
[25:42] and he said everywhere they had to go it
[25:44] was right there and everything that we
[25:45] have need has been has been given to us
[25:47] in this day
[25:49] well because we live in it we live in a
[25:51] world that is nothing but shifting sand
[25:54] there is no sure foundation but brothers
[25:56] and sisters we have a sure foundation
[25:59] we have a sure word of prophecy that
[26:01] when everything else is falling apart we
[26:03] have a place to stand
[26:05] why because we have we live in an hour
[26:07] where everybody has turned against this
[26:09] message they've turned against the word
[26:11] and they live lean to their own
[26:12] understanding but the thing is is
[26:14] everything that everybody has linked to
[26:16] has failed everything else is collapsed
[26:23] you know one of the things that i was
[26:25] thinking about was you know brother
[26:26] branham talks about these
[26:28] these stories and and people that well
[26:31] they're just they're just stories
[26:33] but there's real biblical truth in what
[26:35] he had to say
[26:37] and number two i don't care if anybody
[26:39] i'm just going to go ahead and say this
[26:41] i don't care if anybody says well
[26:43] science says it can't happen
[26:46] well if brother branham said it i'm
[26:48] going to take what brother branham said
[26:50] over what science ever says
[26:55] amen because they were saying they said
[26:57] all these stories about
[26:59] brother i'm talking about the and it's
[27:01] not that they were talking about brother
[27:02] branham specifically
[27:03] specifically but it was about the
[27:06] stories
[27:08] and how you know the eagle carries the
[27:12] young and all these different things and
[27:13] they were saying well this
[27:14] this can't happen said said the young
[27:17] eagles by the time they get out of the
[27:19] nest they're too heavy for
[27:20] the mother to carry and then
[27:24] they come up with these different
[27:25] different reasons about different things
[27:26] and so like i was like well listen
[27:27] brother branham said he was sitting in a
[27:29] on a horse in a saddle with binoculars
[27:32] and he was watching
[27:33] that mother eagle take them baby eagles
[27:36] back up in the mountain
[27:39] that's exactly it's good enough for me
[27:43] but you know it's just like everything
[27:44] else people have taken everything that
[27:47] brother branham had to say
[27:48] everything about the word and they have
[27:50] said it to the side
[27:51] and they they spent all their time well
[27:53] did this really happen
[27:54] did that really happen is it is this
[27:57] true
[27:58] is that that's right true
[28:02] the problem is is people have not come
[28:04] to a sure foundation
[28:07] why because if you lean to your own
[28:09] understanding if that's all you have is
[28:11] is your finite mind then you have no
[28:13] place to stand
[28:14] you're not ever going to reach anything
[28:16] because there's no foundation in
[28:18] in a human in a human body and our human
[28:21] element our human mind
[28:24] we're not ever going to make it
[28:30] but we know that in the last days that
[28:32] one thing would take place that
[28:34] everything that could be shaken would be
[28:36] shaken
[28:37] because anything because everything that
[28:39] can be shaken will be shaken because
[28:41] you're going to find out
[28:42] that nothing else is going to stand
[28:43] because that which is sure
[28:45] and that is that is true is the only
[28:47] thing that's going to stand
[28:50] and because you know we live in a we
[28:52] live in an hour in a day
[28:53] that we see that because god has called
[28:56] a bride
[28:57] and the bride has been called to the
[28:59] place that god has
[29:00] called her to and it's to be the
[29:02] fulfillment of the word
[29:04] and every age god called a bride to be
[29:06] the fulfillment of the word for that day
[29:08] and he has called a bride in our day to
[29:10] fulfill the word
[29:11] and we are to be the word made flesh in
[29:13] our day and we're to be the
[29:15] manifestation of what god has wanted in
[29:17] this hour what the word it says
[29:19] what we should be but we can stand there
[29:23] and we can worry
[29:24] and and and get all frustrated about
[29:26] things but you know what god has called
[29:28] us to a place
[29:30] god has a place for us and that is in
[29:32] the cleft of the rock
[29:35] god has called us to a place
[29:40] why because he wants us to be like jesus
[29:46] you know here's here in the in the
[29:49] message show us the father
[29:52] 1950 brother brown says he was a god-man
[29:57] i believe he was the infinite son of god
[29:59] born of the virgin mary that's right
[30:01] everything the bible said he was i
[30:02] believe he was
[30:04] when he was on earth he looked like god
[30:08] he talked like god he preached like god
[30:10] he rose like god he ascended like god
[30:12] amen
[30:13] he god was in him god manifested here
[30:16] in a body of flesh on the earth in a
[30:18] form his son
[30:19] christ jesus notice
[30:22] god was in his son he was always god
[30:25] deals back there
[30:26] in the beginning when he was with the
[30:28] israelites coming through the wilderness
[30:30] there was there was a rock going along
[30:33] there
[30:33] following them a spiritual rock god told
[30:36] moses smite the rock
[30:37] it'll bring forth water what was it he
[30:40] smoked with the rock
[30:41] that was in his hand the rod wasn't
[30:44] wasn't moses rod that was god's rod the
[30:47] judgment and he smoked the rock
[30:48] and the rock brought forth water
[30:52] he said when one time they wanted a
[30:54] drink
[30:55] they went to the rock when they wanted
[30:57] something to eat they went
[30:58] down there and a bunch of bees had a
[31:00] hive in there
[31:01] in the rock there was a cleft god stood
[31:04] in that cliff the bees had their nest in
[31:06] the cliff
[31:07] everything they had in need of they went
[31:09] to the rock
[31:10] the bible clearly teaches us teaches
[31:13] that christ was the rock was that rock
[31:15] that was in the wilderness
[31:17] he said if you're thirsty not go to the
[31:18] rock if you want honey sweetness go to
[31:21] the rock
[31:21] if you want life go to the rock if you
[31:23] want to believe god was in his son
[31:25] go to the rock he was in the rock speak
[31:28] to the rock and it'll bring forth waters
[31:30] there you are god in his son
[31:33] that's right so when jesus came he said
[31:37] he said
[31:38] i am my father or one and he was the
[31:40] manifestation of that he said everything
[31:41] that my father
[31:43] shows me that's what i do he said i do
[31:45] not the son does nothing of himself
[31:46] except that what the father shows him he
[31:50] said he said i walk
[31:51] here he said because i'm here to please
[31:53] the father
[31:54] he said i'm here to do the will of god
[31:56] and he said he walked like god he talked
[31:58] like god
[31:59] everything was god why because that's
[32:00] who he was
[32:03] and brothers and sisters that's who you
[32:04] and i are as the children of god is the
[32:07] offspring of god
[32:08] is to manifest god in this hour
[32:14] and see it is such a blessing to know
[32:16] who we
[32:17] are and to know what we have but as
[32:19] brother branham said we live so far
[32:21] below our means
[32:22] amen we don't claim what's ours amen
[32:26] because you know god has poured out all
[32:29] things to us
[32:30] and you know you you think of what what
[32:31] he done in his in his life
[32:34] when he came forth all the things that
[32:36] he gave up
[32:39] when he when he left the splendor of
[32:41] heaven and when he when he came and he
[32:43] became
[32:44] to be born of a virgin and he came to to
[32:48] into into this world and he was in a
[32:51] manger over a manure pile
[32:55] here here he was and he came and you
[32:57] know he came to suffer the same things
[32:59] that you and i
[33:00] suffer and he comes to see go through
[33:02] all the same struggles that you and i
[33:04] come through and you know he is our high
[33:06] priest
[33:07] because he can be touched by the feeling
[33:08] of our infirmities and of all the things
[33:10] that he came to do
[33:11] and he came to to close that gasoline to
[33:15] bridge the gas the chasm that was
[33:17] between man and god
[33:18] and he came to do that and bring us back
[33:20] into fellowship with him
[33:21] and to give us all things well the
[33:24] scripture tells us
[33:26] he said we are heirs of god and joint
[33:28] heirs with christ
[33:30] so all the things that he had he said
[33:33] all that god was
[33:34] he poured into christ and then he said
[33:36] all that christ was he poured into the
[33:38] believers
[33:39] so all things have been poured had been
[33:41] given to you and i have been poured into
[33:43] you and i
[33:44] why because we we are just what he is
[33:52] and yet we find people that that don't
[33:55] really
[33:56] they get so so tied up in in the world
[33:59] and you know and the day-to-day life and
[34:01] and we get so bound and we we get so won
[34:03] because all we see is
[34:05] what we see in our in our in our view of
[34:07] these things of these walls and
[34:09] and you know just this three elements
[34:11] that we're you know these three
[34:13] um
[34:17] what's the word brother dimension thank
[34:20] you
[34:20] i knew somebody would know but i mean
[34:23] you know this all we lit we live in
[34:24] these three dimensions and that's all we
[34:25] see we just live in this
[34:26] in this flesh and it's always see
[34:30] and you know we still we still live
[34:31] under this this uh veil
[34:36] we said we you know we live under this
[34:38] thing and you know that's that's the
[34:39] devil's job is to walk around
[34:41] and you know he's he's here to blind you
[34:45] we get so blinded to the things of the
[34:47] world
[34:50] you know you know we're we're spiritual
[34:52] beings but we've we've come to have
[34:54] you know to have a natural as brother
[34:56] ernie always said you know
[34:57] we're we're not natural beings having a
[34:59] spiritual
[35:00] uh experience he said where spiritual
[35:02] beings have unnatural experience
[35:04] but you know how we've come and but you
[35:06] know that's his desire is
[35:08] you know to walk around and you know he
[35:09] just wants us to have blinders on
[35:12] and you know we just walk around with
[35:13] her with our eyes blinded and we can't
[35:15] see but god's trying to
[35:17] the whole time he's trying to remove the
[35:18] veil and you know as
[35:20] as the scripture tells us in revelation
[35:22] you know he said he said buy of me
[35:24] i sav that you can see he said you know
[35:27] there was i salve of the word that he
[35:29] wanted to bring to the people
[35:30] to clear their vision because they
[35:32] couldn't see why because it was so
[35:33] clouded
[35:34] and so many times we allow the devil to
[35:36] come back and cloud our vision
[35:38] of who we are
[35:42] and so many times we see what brother
[35:44] what the prophet told us what brother
[35:45] branham said and what the scripture
[35:46] tells us
[35:47] and then we see these things and we
[35:49] wonder why we don't
[35:50] why we don't advance why because nobody
[35:54] steps out
[35:59] you know and i i i'm preaching on myself
[36:02] i'm the world's worst
[36:05] but when god has called us to a place
[36:07] he's called us to a higher place
[36:10] he's called us to a greater revelation
[36:12] he's called us to a greater thing
[36:14] and then you know what you know what and
[36:15] then we stay in the same place
[36:17] that we've always been we always stay
[36:20] here and god calls us
[36:21] up higher and yet we don't go
[36:25] but brother branham was speaking of an
[36:27] eagle coming in and being born in that
[36:29] rock
[36:30] and brothers and sisters that's you and
[36:32] i we have been born in the rock
[36:35] we've been born of christ jesus we've
[36:38] been born of the word
[36:40] and so we have been born on a sure
[36:43] foundation
[36:44] we have been built on on the foundation
[36:47] of the word of the apostles and the
[36:49] prophets
[36:51] so we have a sure foundation that you
[36:52] have been given to that he has called us
[36:54] to this place
[36:56] it wasn't what you've done it's what he
[36:58] done he's the one that's done it
[37:00] he's the one that's brought you to this
[37:02] place he's picked you here and he wants
[37:04] you to walk in the liberty of it
[37:18] this is from the message the eagle
[37:19] stirring her nest
[37:25] brother ram says he says yet an eagle
[37:29] all he hears how much different he is
[37:31] from the chicken but they're
[37:33] they're both birds what is the chicken
[37:35] the chicken is a denominational brother
[37:36] but he's a chicken
[37:38] how much different is from chicken but
[37:40] the eagle goes just as high as he can
[37:42] and builds his nest in the cleft of the
[37:44] rock and he goes up there so no predator
[37:47] can get to him
[37:48] he said that's the way a real preacher
[37:50] builds his church
[37:51] as an eagle of god he places it on the
[37:53] word and the spirit of god
[37:56] he says you know all these old gappers
[37:57] and different things none of this
[37:59] can affect you
[38:02] he said because he could send eagles so
[38:04] high born in the kingdom of god
[38:07] you talk about these you know elvis
[38:08] presley and all author godfrey
[38:10] the bunch of stuff just turn away for it
[38:13] because you are
[38:14] eagles in the hour in the hour of god
[38:17] is as the spirit of the living god he
[38:20] said they're high ambitions
[38:23] so you know the eagle goes to the the
[38:26] highest place
[38:28] the highest place that he can reach well
[38:31] because that's what god has called us to
[38:33] to a higher place to the highest place
[38:35] that we can reach
[38:37] why because it's always a stepping stone
[38:40] why because
[38:41] you know you you come from from your old
[38:44] life and there's
[38:44] there's a step of justification which is
[38:47] a little higher in god
[38:48] and then their sanctification is a
[38:49] little higher in god and the new birth
[38:51] is you know the baptism of the holy
[38:53] ghost is a little bit higher in god
[38:54] but then there's more steps above of
[38:56] that to keep on climbing in
[38:58] in god amen
[39:02] and the message and hearing the message
[39:05] the eagle in in her nest brother bran
[39:08] was speaking he says and as the church
[39:10] was born in the cleft of the rock he
[39:12] said we cannot be satisfied there
[39:16] god stirs up the nest sometimes comes in
[39:19] with a mighty rushing wind like he did
[39:21] on the day of pentecost
[39:22] and all the old worldly loose feathers
[39:24] fly out he sends a pentecostal revival
[39:27] and shakes up the nest then he gives a
[39:30] certain scream
[39:31] and all the little eaglets know
[39:32] something's fixing to happen
[39:34] they're eagles that's the reason when
[39:36] you see a shaking
[39:38] time come eagles are ready for a
[39:39] blessing the church is ready for
[39:41] something the true
[39:42] church of god when they see a shaking
[39:45] time coming
[39:47] amen and brothers and sisters
[39:50] we are living in a shaking time
[39:57] but god has called you to a place
[40:02] so whatever place god has called you to
[40:05] you know there's a higher place to come
[40:07] to
[40:08] and he says a real true eagle is not
[40:09] going to be satisfied where she's at
[40:13] so there's a higher place to come to so
[40:15] there's a because he said he said when
[40:17] when it's time to move and sometimes we
[40:19] get stuck in a place where we don't move
[40:21] he said then the winds of revival start
[40:22] blowing the holy ghost
[40:24] starts moving for us to move on
[40:27] so it's time and many times we we fail
[40:29] to move when the holy ghost moves
[40:33] many times many times we've had times in
[40:35] our lives where things have
[40:36] come and the lord's tried to speak to us
[40:38] to move on and we fail to move on
[40:41] why because we're so afraid to step out
[40:43] in faith to move with god
[40:45] why because we but see if we fail to
[40:48] realize who we are
[40:50] and what god has called us to and who we
[40:52] are if we know who we are
[40:55] anyway i mean it's it's so because you
[40:57] know it's just like a child
[41:01] you know i i talk about my my boys you
[41:04] know
[41:05] my little levi wherever he's at he just
[41:07] turned 16.
[41:10] little he is like my dad always said
[41:14] he's in the back like my dad always said
[41:16] i never was little
[41:17] so i used to tell everybody when i was
[41:19] little my dad said you never was little
[41:21] so i'd always tell everybody when i was
[41:22] young he couldn't he couldn't argue with
[41:24] that
[41:26] but you know when when children you know
[41:28] they put their full trust in you
[41:34] you know it's like it's like you know
[41:35] you you walk up to when they're little
[41:37] and you
[41:38] get your nose and you and they're like
[41:41] oh yeah
[41:42] no i still got it but you know they have
[41:46] trust and what is it i mean
[41:47] you'll stand there and they'll jump off
[41:49] of something
[41:51] and they believe you'll catch them
[41:54] you get a few more years like you know
[41:56] what i don't i wouldn't jump off this
[41:57] right here too much you know
[42:01] you know going to hold on to something
[42:05] and then everybody's like well you know
[42:06] we got to start looking to see what
[42:08] what could happen well they don't do
[42:11] that
[42:13] why they they have trust
[42:18] and if we had faith you know because you
[42:20] know i can fail
[42:22] you can fail know that everybody but you
[42:24] know what there's one thing that god
[42:26] cannot do
[42:28] he cannot fail
[42:31] god cannot fail
[42:34] and so when god says listen i have
[42:36] something for you
[42:39] so if he has something for us then you
[42:41] know what it's not it's
[42:42] he's not an indian giver so if he's
[42:45] called us to this place
[42:46] that we can get into to be on this rock
[42:50] right to have a sure foundation that you
[42:52] know we don't have to worry about what's
[42:54] coming
[42:56] do we need to just put our full trust in
[42:58] him and believe have confidence in what
[43:00] god says
[43:01] and we can just walk with god and not
[43:03] have to worry about everything
[43:06] but we allow when the winds blow and
[43:08] things happen
[43:09] and then we start to worry what's going
[43:11] to happen
[43:13] well you know what it's not that i put
[43:15] my trust in a man
[43:17] i don't have i don't have trust in a man
[43:20] amen
[43:21] but i do have trust in the and the god
[43:24] of that man i don't have trust
[43:27] i don't you know because i don't put
[43:29] brother branham up on a pedestal
[43:31] we honor and reverence the man for the
[43:33] god-given
[43:34] gift in his life and the call that he
[43:36] was given in the office that he had
[43:37] but that didn't change who he was he was
[43:39] still a man and he still had to pass
[43:42] away but you know what that didn't
[43:43] change the god that was in that man
[43:47] we don't we we don't worship a pastor
[43:50] but we honor and reverence a pastor
[43:52] because he's a god-given man
[43:54] and he's been given a call and he's been
[43:56] given an office
[43:57] to do a job for us he is a servant to us
[44:02] and so he said brother branham said that
[44:04] he was ordained of god to lead you
[44:06] through but you know what
[44:08] a a pastor is not somebody to be your
[44:12] babysitter
[44:13] he's not somebody to push you along but
[44:15] he's supposed to guide you along
[44:17] and you know it's not his job to answer
[44:19] every little single question why because
[44:21] there's a time
[44:22] that he can guide you but he's guiding
[44:24] you to christ and it's between you
[44:26] and god not not not to have somebody to
[44:30] you know
[44:30] do i have to ask him every single
[44:32] question no we've got to grow up
[44:33] and realize that he can see that god is
[44:36] being manifested in you
[44:40] that's right so then then
[44:43] brother he doesn't he doesn't have to
[44:45] you know worry and and all these things
[44:47] you know and worry about what's going to
[44:48] take place and all the stress that comes
[44:50] with
[44:51] it
[44:54] one because if you and i stand on our
[44:55] own two feet then you know what then he
[44:58] can see
[44:58] that we are following the word that has
[45:00] been preached
[45:02] as he stood up here the other other
[45:04] sunday and said you know he said
[45:06] we can say that the word has been
[45:07] preached in this church we've had the
[45:09] word in our day the word has come
[45:11] through
[45:11] from this pulpit then you and i we can
[45:14] stand and walk on that
[45:17] but it's not but it's not been a man
[45:20] it's been gone all the way
[45:22] and so then you know then god wants us
[45:24] to continue in that
[45:28] so when things happen when things come
[45:30] our way it's not a man that we're
[45:32] looking at
[45:32] it's god well because the one thing that
[45:34] hasn't changed
[45:36] even though you know brother dale maybe
[45:37] not be preaching at this time but
[45:39] there's one thing that we're not looking
[45:40] at we're not looking at a man
[45:42] we're looking at god god is not changed
[45:44] you nothing has changed
[45:46] god's still the same
[45:52] so then i have i have total confidence
[45:54] in and whatever's going to take place
[45:56] why because god has it in control
[45:58] i don't have any control i don't have to
[46:00] worry about it
[46:04] and many times people will almost get to
[46:05] the point where they start to get
[46:06] white-knuckled about things i don't have
[46:08] to
[46:09] god wants you to know that there's no
[46:10] need to be like that
[46:12] because if you're in the in the cleft of
[46:14] the rock that was that was christ if
[46:16] you're in that cleft
[46:17] then you don't have to worry about the
[46:18] storms you don't have to worry about the
[46:20] heartaches and the pressures
[46:22] why because as brother branham said he
[46:24] said when that eagle went into that
[46:25] cleft of the rock and stayed there he
[46:27] said then he could let off the pressure
[46:33] so we have a place that we can go to
[46:37] god wants us to be firm at our
[46:40] foundation
[46:41] to be where god wants us to be
[46:48] so we don't have to worry about what
[46:51] takes place
[46:53] god has it under control but you know
[46:57] you and i are the ones that we have a
[47:00] responsibility
[47:03] we're the ones that brother brown said
[47:05] we're supposed to be praying for our
[47:06] pastor
[47:08] then you know we have we have that
[47:10] responsibility to do that
[47:13] amen why because he has stood
[47:17] he has stood for us so many times and
[47:18] now it's our time to stand for him
[47:29] but uh you know and if i
[47:32] can say anything tonight you know
[47:35] i i just i just won't i just want your
[47:37] faith to be built
[47:40] i want you i want your faith to rise up
[47:45] i want your hearts to be comforted
[47:48] i want i want you to walk out of here
[47:50] tonight knowing that god is in
[47:52] control whatever you've heard today and
[47:54] we we get so wrapped up on things that
[47:56] happen in the world
[47:57] and the things that we hear and what the
[47:59] devil sits on our shoulder and tells us
[48:01] what the doctor has told us all these
[48:03] different things that have talked to us
[48:04] but let me tell you what
[48:06] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[48:08] and forever
[48:09] what he said in the past is still the
[48:11] truth today and it didn't change
[48:13] that's right why because the one that
[48:16] came
[48:16] the one that one that set all the stars
[48:18] into heaven in orbit
[48:20] and he spoke all things into existence
[48:23] came in human flesh and came
[48:25] and became became your redeemer
[48:28] and became your father and became your
[48:30] god and he became your advocate
[48:33] and he's the same one today that he's
[48:35] your healer
[48:36] and of all these things that he's done
[48:38] he's come and now he's going to tell you
[48:40] no fear let your hearts be comforted
[48:45] so if you begin to say all these things
[48:47] the brothers and sisters let me tell you
[48:48] that's what god wants you to have
[48:51] whatever you have need of all you've got
[48:53] to do is reach out and get it one
[48:54] because he said
[48:55] because he said that rock followed them
[48:58] and he said it's the same rockets
[49:00] following the church today and if it's
[49:02] the same rock that's following you and i
[49:03] today
[49:04] it's right there for us but many times
[49:07] we fail to realize
[49:09] that's that that the cleft of the rock
[49:11] that smitten rock was right there
[49:18] when all the storms and all the things
[49:20] happen
[49:22] we don't have to worry amen
[49:26] there's a cleft in the rock you know the
[49:30] the cleft
[49:33] was when moses struck the rock and it
[49:35] created that cleft in the rock
[49:39] brother brown said that was the spear
[49:41] mark in the side of jesus amen
[49:45] that's right he said it opened up
[49:51] it created the access
[49:55] so when the bride came out from him but
[49:58] he said that's where the bride came back
[49:59] to
[50:01] right in the heart of god amen
[50:10] see many times we fail to realize what
[50:12] god thinks of us
[50:14] what god sees of us
[50:18] he said he said when you get to this
[50:20] place he said it's not a place to weary
[50:24] he said he said we get so worried about
[50:26] things and we get so wrapped up in
[50:27] things but he said he said this is not a
[50:29] place to be worried
[50:30] he said this is a satisfying place he
[50:33] said this is a place to be satisfied
[50:36] so that because when it was as in psalms
[50:38] that we're reading in psalms 103
[50:40] he said he said he fills my mouth with
[50:42] good things so that my youth are renewed
[50:43] like the eagles
[50:45] why because when that eagle went back
[50:46] into that cleft of the rock then he had
[50:48] a place that he could let off the
[50:49] pressure
[50:50] brother brown said when he went into
[50:51] that place and he and he was there then
[50:53] that he could scream out that he was
[50:57] that he was relieved of those pressures
[51:02] so we have a satisfying place god wants
[51:04] us to realize who we are
[51:06] and what god thinks of us
[51:10] see many many times many times we get so
[51:12] we get so mindful of
[51:14] the things of the world that we don't
[51:15] realize what god thinks of us
[51:17] and we don't we don't think of what god
[51:18] thinks of us then we don't realize what
[51:20] god wants us
[51:21] what has in store for us what the good
[51:24] that he has
[51:25] for us you know and it's and it's so
[51:28] good because even even when we do wrong
[51:30] yet as the scriptures as we were reading
[51:32] there when we took the communion there
[51:34] you know then we are chastened to the
[51:36] lord
[51:37] well because that's god's love to us
[51:39] that he would chasten us
[51:41] he said that we will not be condemned
[51:42] with the world
[51:44] well because there's a separating where
[51:46] we're separated from the world
[51:48] we're not like the world there is a
[51:50] blessing a covenant that we have that
[51:52] the world doesn't
[51:53] know anything about they don't have what
[51:55] we have
[51:56] but you know there's a place that we can
[51:58] come to that we can do we show the world
[52:01] what god who god is and what god is what
[52:04] the love of god is
[52:05] the world is looking to see what these
[52:07] things are when it's you and i
[52:12] but you know so many times we we just we
[52:14] just let ourselves get wrapped up and
[52:16] we're just
[52:16] we're just you know uh living the normal
[52:20] life
[52:20] just we're just an employee somewhere
[52:23] we're just
[52:23] a college student we're just a high
[52:25] school student we're just a kid
[52:27] we're just you know just going through
[52:29] the norm we're just going through the
[52:30] normal way of life the normal routes and
[52:33] everything and not realizing
[52:35] you know god you can be god to people
[52:40] god wants to show the world jesus christ
[52:42] the love of god
[52:43] well who is he going to show that to
[52:46] through
[52:52] so god has called us to this place
[52:58] that we can we can be what god has us to
[53:02] be
[53:04] to come into that cleft of the rock
[53:09] that christ was smitten and it opened up
[53:13] he opened up access for you and i to
[53:15] come
[53:16] to come back he wanted us to come back
[53:20] to
[53:23] so many times you know we we get into in
[53:26] our lives and we're so we're so bound
[53:29] down by things
[53:30] and we don't realize who we are what god
[53:33] has done
[53:34] what the blessings god has given us and
[53:37] he's called us to these things that we
[53:38] need
[53:39] to step forward and and walk in the
[53:41] liberty that he has given us
[53:43] to understand that we are in this cleft
[53:45] of the rock and if we're standing in
[53:47] this cliff
[53:48] then then we have we have to the
[53:50] pressure to let off
[53:53] you know brother bran was speaking of of
[53:54] that
[54:00] of the eagle and one time he was talking
[54:04] about
[54:04] you know he tells the story about that
[54:05] old eagle
[54:08] and he said you know they're in a and
[54:10] that old eagle you know he gets he gets
[54:12] all bound down with all these bad
[54:15] uh growth and and different things and
[54:18] he just gets so
[54:18] hardened and he gets so bound down with
[54:22] things of the
[54:23] of the world the cares of life and he
[54:25] said he said he gets all over his beak
[54:27] and he gets all over his head
[54:30] and he said when he gets so bound that
[54:31] you know he can't he can't live in that
[54:33] situation
[54:35] he said he's got to go to the rock
[54:38] and he said he said when he goes to the
[54:40] rock he said there's a place for that
[54:42] eagle to go to and he said
[54:45] he said you know when he he's you know
[54:46] he's down there and where he's born he's
[54:48] on that one rock but there's a higher
[54:50] rock to go to and he keeps climbing and
[54:52] he goes to the highest one that he can
[54:53] get to
[54:54] and he's in there and he finds a place
[54:56] and then and job it talks about he said
[54:58] he said he said he goes to the crag of
[55:00] the rock he said you know he's on the
[55:02] solid rock he said then the cry
[55:04] the crag of the rock and he said a
[55:06] strong place
[55:07] and he said he said that eagle goes into
[55:09] that place and he said he'll stand there
[55:12] and realizing that if something doesn't
[55:14] take place he's going to die
[55:17] he gets to a place of desperation and
[55:19] when he's in there he walks up to that
[55:21] rock and he said he
[55:22] begins to beat his head on that rock why
[55:25] because
[55:26] through that rock is the is the way that
[55:28] he is
[55:29] comes back to life and he stands there
[55:31] and he begins to beat and he says
[55:32] oh he said he goes through all kinds of
[55:34] torture going through that
[55:36] that beating that he has to go through
[55:38] all that stress and the trauma that he's
[55:40] going through
[55:41] to have that stuff removed from his head
[55:43] and he said he begins to beat on that
[55:44] thing and he said you know then it just
[55:47] rattles his brain but he goes up there
[55:49] and he keeps doing that
[55:50] and he keeps beating on that and he said
[55:52] that's the way you and i are we have a
[55:54] place to go to
[55:55] that we can have all that stuff removed
[55:56] but you know what you've been called to
[55:58] that
[55:59] you've been called to that place to do
[56:01] that there's a place you know because
[56:03] you know
[56:04] you have to desire to have that stuff
[56:05] removed he said he said you know as long
[56:08] as that eagle is there
[56:09] he said as long as he can feel a little
[56:11] bit of that stuff hanging on
[56:12] he'll stay right there and beat his head
[56:15] until he gets all that stuff
[56:17] beat off of him and so he said there's a
[56:20] place that you come to why because it
[56:21] begins to move all of the things of the
[56:23] world
[56:24] and all the things that that has that
[56:26] has been in the past
[56:27] that's held him down that has that has
[56:30] uh
[56:30] limited him in all these areas but he
[56:33] realizes he said it becomes a
[56:35] he sees the blood as it begins to flow
[56:36] and all these things as it goes through
[56:38] but he said he realizes there's a place
[56:40] for him to be
[56:41] and he begins to beat and he begins to
[56:43] beat and he said you know there's a rock
[56:45] there that has
[56:46] there's a special rock that's there that
[56:48] he has to beat his head on to break all
[56:50] that stuff loose
[56:51] and there's a destinated place for him
[56:52] to come to for him to beat all that
[56:54] stuff loose
[56:55] and he knows what he has to do and
[56:58] brothers and sisters there's a rock that
[57:00] you and i have come to
[57:01] and then and that special rock has been
[57:04] called to
[57:04] you know we can stand on a sure
[57:06] foundation but you know there's things
[57:07] in our lives we still got to get rid of
[57:09] there's things that still hold us back
[57:11] that we've held on for too long
[57:12] that bind us that hinder us and there's
[57:14] a way to get rid of it
[57:16] and brothers and sisters we have been
[57:18] stood before a rock
[57:21] a rock there has been a rock one because
[57:24] there's a way to get rid of
[57:26] of the things of the world the things
[57:28] that hold you back why because you can
[57:30] be a son of god
[57:31] or whatever but there's still things
[57:32] that god wants to wants to get out of
[57:34] our lives and we have to be molded into
[57:36] the image of christ
[57:37] and there's a place that we can go to
[57:38] that special rock that's honed a certain
[57:41] way
[57:42] i was reading i was reading an article
[57:43] this man was speaking of of the rock
[57:45] formations and
[57:46] and you know he was talking about a
[57:47] craig and most of the time we think of a
[57:49] crag just being a
[57:51] extension out of a rock that comes out
[57:53] to a certain point and
[57:54] you know sometimes they have points and
[57:56] different things but the one
[57:57] i was reading this article and the man
[57:59] was talking about a crag of a rock and
[58:00] how it comes up out of the mountain
[58:02] and he said the one thing that he
[58:03] mentioned that struck my attention was
[58:05] he was talking about how this thing is
[58:06] honed
[58:07] this rock is home to a certain point and
[58:09] so when this rock is home
[58:11] why because there's a honing that has to
[58:13] be done
[58:14] there's a special rock that we come to
[58:16] one that's home to the
[58:17] to this word that has come to the day
[58:20] that we live in
[58:21] that is to own us to that so you know
[58:24] it's no longer i
[58:25] it's not me but to cut away all of the
[58:28] worldly
[58:29] all of the old man all the other things
[58:31] that we can be just
[58:32] jesus christ that we molded him the
[58:35] image of jesus christ and there's a rock
[58:37] that can come in and just cut all that
[58:39] away and we have been given that in our
[58:41] day that we can
[58:42] you know that we have to come to this
[58:43] foundation but there's a rock that's
[58:45] here to cut all these other things away
[58:47] from us
[58:48] amen and we can be cut and we can we can
[58:51] be
[58:52] free from all these things and he said
[58:54] as long as he
[58:55] begins to feel just a little bit of that
[58:57] old
[58:58] junk that he's held on that has bound
[59:00] him he said he's going to stay right
[59:02] there and he's not going to leave
[59:04] and he said he's going to stay right
[59:05] there and he's going to get all that
[59:06] stuff loose
[59:08] and he said until he breaks all that
[59:10] stuff loose and when he gets off of his
[59:12] head
[59:12] and off his beak and everything when he
[59:13] gets free he said then he begins to
[59:15] scream
[59:16] he begins to scream that he's free that
[59:19] he is that he's been freed from these
[59:21] things and brothers and sisters when you
[59:23] receive the word in our day when you've
[59:24] received the word of freedom and liberty
[59:27] and he has set you free
[59:28] then you can see and stand up and
[59:30] proclaim your liberty and freedom and
[59:31] say
[59:32] who you are
[59:35] god has called us to these things that
[59:37] you can that we can stand up and
[59:38] proclaim what god has done in our day
[59:45] not to be bound by the things of the
[59:46] world
[59:49] but god has called us to this place
[59:53] god has called us to the place that we
[59:54] can be free from these things
[59:58] and i'm so thankful that we have a word
[1:00:00] that has been given in our day
[1:00:06] as he said add to your faith
[1:00:10] so your faith is where that foundation
[1:00:12] is where you're on that rock
[1:00:16] but he said he said that eagle gets to a
[1:00:18] place where they start wanting to find a
[1:00:19] higher place
[1:00:21] he said they can't be satisfied where
[1:00:22] they are
[1:00:25] what is that he said add to your faith
[1:00:27] virtue
[1:00:29] and to virtue knowledge in that honing
[1:00:32] rock
[1:00:32] that stone as you're going up there's a
[1:00:36] honing that's taking place
[1:00:38] why because as because when god starts
[1:00:41] to speak to you
[1:00:42] you still feel the things of the world
[1:00:47] but you know that's what he's doing he's
[1:00:48] calling you to realize hey i still got
[1:00:50] things i got to get rid of but he's
[1:00:53] called you to stand in the cleft of the
[1:00:55] rock
[1:00:56] that you can be free from these things
[1:01:01] and so we stand in the cleft of the rock
[1:01:02] and we see these things and god wants us
[1:01:04] to be free of these things
[1:01:06] many times the word is bred has been
[1:01:08] brought forth why because it shows us
[1:01:10] what needs to be taken place
[1:01:12] lord let us be free from these things
[1:01:14] lord help us get rid of these things
[1:01:17] what is it that needs to what we need to
[1:01:18] do lord help us
[1:01:20] that we can step forth and we can cut
[1:01:22] all these things of the world loose from
[1:01:23] us
[1:01:24] lord we don't we don't want to be bound
[1:01:25] by the things of the world
[1:01:28] while we still we still fight a carnal
[1:01:29] mind
[1:01:31] this body is still under under the curse
[1:01:33] of death
[1:01:35] but what there's a word that's been
[1:01:36] given that we can cut away all these
[1:01:38] things
[1:01:39] that we can be free to walk in the
[1:01:43] liberty of the word
[1:01:45] the word has called us to a body change
[1:01:47] well if he's called us to a body change
[1:01:49] then what is the body
[1:01:50] then the word has called us to cut away
[1:01:52] all these things well
[1:01:53] death is still holding on but you know
[1:01:55] what he will not hold us
[1:01:57] why because the word has been given to
[1:01:59] us to cut all that away
[1:02:02] when the when death when death starts up
[1:02:04] your sleeve when the death
[1:02:06] angel comes or whatever you know what
[1:02:07] he'll have to pass you by why because he
[1:02:09] don't have a hold on
[1:02:11] there's a place that we can come to
[1:02:12] there's a body change that's been called
[1:02:14] to us
[1:02:15] a group of people and we've been called
[1:02:17] to that place
[1:02:19] and i want you know realizing that how
[1:02:21] fortified you are
[1:02:24] when all the storms that rage and all
[1:02:27] the things that take place
[1:02:28] you're on a sure foundation
[1:02:33] just as just as moses there you know
[1:02:36] god's speaking to moses and
[1:02:38] you know he began to speak to him he
[1:02:39] said lord i want to see you
[1:02:42] lord i want to see who you are
[1:02:48] and in that time god told moses he said
[1:02:51] i have a special place for you
[1:02:54] he said i want you to come stand in this
[1:02:56] rock
[1:02:57] in this cleft of the rock
[1:03:02] braham was speaking he said that
[1:03:06] moses smote the rock and it created the
[1:03:08] cleft
[1:03:10] it brought forth the water but then
[1:03:11] moses went back in that cleft
[1:03:14] to see god and god has a place for you
[1:03:18] you want to see more of god there's a
[1:03:19] place
[1:03:20] to be standing right that you can see
[1:03:22] more of god god has a place for you
[1:03:24] amen and so that cleft is for everybody
[1:03:29] there's a higher place to come to
[1:03:32] that we can come to that we can see god
[1:03:37] brother brown says this is from letting
[1:03:39] off the pressure brother brahm says
[1:03:41] he said i know a rock the man can come
[1:03:45] to
[1:03:45] and he said and can beat and be beat
[1:03:48] until all the doubt is gone
[1:03:50] all the worry and cares of the world is
[1:03:52] gone
[1:03:53] when he's beat the crust of sin from
[1:03:55] around him
[1:03:56] until the blood has sanctified his soul
[1:03:59] then eternal life is sure to come
[1:04:01] he can just sit back and let off the
[1:04:03] pressure because he
[1:04:05] eternal life is sure oh eagles today
[1:04:07] that's why
[1:04:08] you're here your eaglets but if the
[1:04:11] crust has begun to blind your eyes
[1:04:13] the cares of the world or you just can't
[1:04:15] swallow all the food of god
[1:04:17] let's come to that rock in a weary land
[1:04:20] that's come
[1:04:21] let's come there and beat upon the altar
[1:04:23] until the crust is broke
[1:04:25] and our eyes can see clearly jesus again
[1:04:28] and the cares of this world has passed
[1:04:30] away then the pressure will let off
[1:04:33] he's a rock in a weary land a shelter in
[1:04:35] this time
[1:04:36] in a time of storm a refuge a haven of
[1:04:39] rest for the weary
[1:04:40] he said let's come to that place
[1:04:43] amen god bless you tonight you can
[1:04:46] stand how the musicians come
[1:04:56] i want to sing that song brother brother
[1:04:59] boyd
[1:05:00] uh he hideth my soul
[1:05:04] in the cleft of the rock
[1:05:08] that shadow's a dry thirsty land
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:16] you know you can be in a weary place you
[1:05:18] can be in a dry place but you know what
[1:05:22] god's there and if that rock is there
[1:05:25] behind you
[1:05:26] he's oh look how dry it is and they were
[1:05:29] like just like the children of israel
[1:05:30] they were so afraid that they were going
[1:05:32] to be
[1:05:32] they're going to dry they're going we're
[1:05:34] going to die right here
[1:05:36] and not realizing the rock is right
[1:05:37] there everything that they had needed
[1:05:39] was right there
[1:05:41] and many times we get wrapped up well
[1:05:43] what's going to happen next what's going
[1:05:44] to happen next
[1:05:46] well you know what god has every
[1:05:48] footstep the footsteps
[1:05:50] of the righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:05:53] so whatever
[1:05:53] happens you know what god has his hand
[1:05:56] in it amen
[1:05:58] so if if you know if sickness comes my
[1:06:01] way
[1:06:02] then you know what it doesn't change the
[1:06:04] fact that he's still the healer
[1:06:06] and if and if you have any kind of
[1:06:09] problem in your life
[1:06:10] if it's financial then you know what he
[1:06:12] still knows how to make a way
[1:06:15] well because the scripture tells us that
[1:06:18] peter was there with jesus and they had
[1:06:20] to pay their taxes well you know what
[1:06:21] they went fishing
[1:06:25] when the woman had had to pay your bill
[1:06:27] and the prophet come to her and told her
[1:06:28] so we'll gather up all the vessels
[1:06:33] well then you know what they started he
[1:06:35] said and then when when it became a
[1:06:37] famine
[1:06:38] and and i i love i love i love that
[1:06:41] story elijah
[1:06:42] you know he's sitting he's sitting down
[1:06:43] there by the uh
[1:06:45] the uh brook cherith he's sitting there
[1:06:48] and the ravens are feeding him
[1:06:51] you know he's getting spiritual
[1:06:52] sandwiches
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:55] he's getting fed meat and bread and he's
[1:06:57] sitting there beside the
[1:06:58] brook and he's and he's drinking and
[1:07:00] he's just enjoying himself in the
[1:07:02] presence of the lord
[1:07:04] and god tells him said listen i've
[1:07:06] prepared a widow woman
[1:07:09] to sustain you
[1:07:12] i'm doing pretty good right here beside
[1:07:14] this brook but there's this woman over
[1:07:16] there
[1:07:17] with her and her son and she's starving
[1:07:19] to death and she's milling
[1:07:21] measuring out the meal and wondering how
[1:07:23] long her meal is going to last
[1:07:26] and she's sitting there scraping in the
[1:07:27] barrel trying to figure out where she
[1:07:29] was
[1:07:29] what's going to take place but you know
[1:07:31] what she did not realize
[1:07:33] she did not look in that other realm
[1:07:35] because there was a way that was already
[1:07:37] made for her but she didn't see it
[1:07:40] she didn't see what god had prepared for
[1:07:42] her
[1:07:43] but she was sitting just scraping by on
[1:07:46] that little meal
[1:07:48] but when when elijah came out of the out
[1:07:50] of the wilderness and he came to her
[1:07:52] and he spoke to her then you know what
[1:07:55] she done she
[1:07:56] went along with what he said he said can
[1:07:59] you give me can you give me a drink of
[1:08:01] water
[1:08:02] and you know what didn't hinder her
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:06] and he said oh can you make me a little
[1:08:07] cake you know that called her attention
[1:08:11] but you know what she stood there and
[1:08:13] said i'm you know i'm the prophet of god
[1:08:17] and i have brought you a word that's
[1:08:19] right amen
[1:08:20] and i want to tell you something sister
[1:08:22] he said if you make me a little
[1:08:24] cake first he said you'll never go
[1:08:27] hungry all through this famine
[1:08:30] he said everybody around you is going to
[1:08:32] be starving to death
[1:08:33] and you're going to see death and
[1:08:35] destruction and all these things but it
[1:08:36] won't touch you
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:40] why because god had made provision for
[1:08:42] her
[1:08:43] and she went out there and made it and
[1:08:44] didn't matter how little that cake was
[1:08:47] she followed the word that the prophet
[1:08:48] had given her and she made that cake
[1:08:51] and he took that cake and because she
[1:08:53] honored his word
[1:08:55] and she followed what he had to say that
[1:08:57] she was blessed
[1:08:59] and brothers and sisters we've been
[1:09:00] given a word in our day and we take this
[1:09:03] word
[1:09:03] and we believe it and if we pray for
[1:09:06] for somebody and they don't get healed
[1:09:08] well then they should send us into
[1:09:09] desperation
[1:09:10] but you know what i'm not going to give
[1:09:12] up i'm going to continue to pray till
[1:09:13] they get healed
[1:09:16] whatever you have need of then you know
[1:09:18] what we can stand here and claim it we
[1:09:20] don't have to lay hands on you you
[1:09:21] believe it you stand up and proclaim it
[1:09:23] you say what god said
[1:09:27] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:09:29] that what is your confession tonight
[1:09:31] because if you're standing in that cleft
[1:09:33] that he has opened the word to you
[1:09:35] and you're fortified behind the word
[1:09:37] then you can say
[1:09:41] he said he said you say to this mountain
[1:09:45] and don't doubt in your heart
[1:09:48] brothers and sisters we should get rid
[1:09:50] of because god's made a way for us to
[1:09:52] get rid of the doubt
[1:09:53] that we can stand behind the word and we
[1:09:55] can proclaim what god has said
[1:09:58] why because we can claim our families
[1:10:00] and not have to worry when do things go
[1:10:02] up and down and all things go sideways
[1:10:04] we don't have to worry when you
[1:10:07] when you go to the doctor and he gives
[1:10:08] you a bad report then you know what we
[1:10:10] go
[1:10:11] to the great physician and i tell you
[1:10:13] it's always a good report
[1:10:18] what if you if you have a need and
[1:10:20] financial or whatever spiritual whatever
[1:10:23] it is
[1:10:23] if you're praying about something you
[1:10:25] say well lord i just don't see these
[1:10:27] things
[1:10:27] in the scripture just right i don't
[1:10:29] understand how these things put together
[1:10:31] and i've heard brother wade preaching
[1:10:32] i've heard brother dale preaching the
[1:10:33] brothers
[1:10:34] they preached these things and i've read
[1:10:35] what you what you said i just don't see
[1:10:37] it to come together it just
[1:10:39] it's cloudy and it's a little i don't
[1:10:40] understand these things
[1:10:42] speaking of what he said he said a real
[1:10:45] true eagle
[1:10:46] will understand
[1:10:49] well then you know what i can just put
[1:10:51] my faith in i put my confidence in that
[1:10:55] well i don't know when it's going to
[1:10:56] come it may not you know brother dale
[1:10:58] can tell you
[1:10:58] all those years that he said reading
[1:11:00] written seven eight books seven five
[1:11:02] books whatever listen to two tapes all
[1:11:03] the things
[1:11:04] you know he didn't it just didn't come
[1:11:06] overnight just fall in his lap
[1:11:09] well because it came gradually it came
[1:11:12] bit by bit
[1:11:13] little little by little
[1:11:17] he said you know hear there a little bit
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:21] word upon word line upon line precept
[1:11:24] upon precept so he began to add upon
[1:11:26] those things
[1:11:29] well brothers and sisters don't fail to
[1:11:31] hold on
[1:11:32] don't fail to hold on to what god
[1:11:34] whatever you claim that hold on to it
[1:11:37] don't back up don't worry about the
