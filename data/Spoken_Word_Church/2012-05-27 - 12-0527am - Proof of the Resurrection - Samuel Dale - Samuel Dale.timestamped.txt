[4:59] Malachi 4
[5:01] and First Corinthians right
[5:07] now remember as I said this afternoon
[5:09] only the services will be at 1 45
[5:12] we're trying to be in the Pulpit by two
[5:14] o'clock okay
[5:16] so we can get done okay and behold the
[5:19] Day comments that shall turn they'll
[5:21] burn as an oven and all that the proud
[5:23] yay and all that do wickedly shall be
[5:25] stubble
[5:27] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[5:29] up set the Lord of hosts said it shall
[5:31] lead them neither root nor branch but
[5:33] unto you that fear my name shall the son
[5:37] of righteousness arise with healings in
[5:39] his wings and ye shall go forth and grow
[5:41] fish calves from the stall and you shall
[5:43] tread down to Wicked for they shall be
[5:45] acted Under The Souls of your feet in
[5:48] the day that I shall do this saith the
[5:50] Lord of hosts now let's go to First
[5:53] Corinthians
[5:55] 15 beginning with verse 12.
[6:02] now Christ be preached that he rose from
[6:05] the dead now watch
[6:07] and if Christ be preached that he rose
[6:09] from the dead
[6:11] I'll say some among you that there is no
[6:15] resurrection of the Dead
[6:19] and we'll get to that in a little bit
[6:20] because see there's a lot of people in
[6:22] this message even believe that there's
[6:24] no physical resurrection of a body
[6:27] that we're going to go through this kind
[6:28] of a change in that kind of a change and
[6:29] one of these days we're going to get
[6:30] back with it later on down the road
[6:32] somewhere I never did understand what he
[6:33] was talking about but they don't believe
[6:35] in the physical Resurrection
[6:37] I believe whatever goes down the prophet
[6:39] said we'll come back up Jesus died rose
[6:43] with nail prints in his hand amen all
[6:45] right see we're not looking this this
[6:47] body to be redeemed and that's what he's
[6:49] saying here and if Christ be preached
[6:52] that he rose from the dead
[6:54] I'll say something among you that there
[6:55] is no resurrection of thee but if there
[6:58] be no resurrection of the dead then
[6:59] Christ is not risen so amen if there's
[7:03] not going to be a resurrection or if
[7:04] it's not a resurrection then
[7:06] Christ is not risen all right plain sins
[7:09] and if Christ be not risen then our
[7:11] preaching is vain and your faith is also
[7:14] a vain
[7:15] yay and we are found false Witnesses
[7:20] oh God now what about that amen if you
[7:24] don't believe in the resurrection of the
[7:25] Dead you're a false witness amen but
[7:28] people in this message are still saying
[7:30] that they don't believe that to them all
[7:32] right
[7:33] because we have testified of God
[7:37] that he raised up Christ
[7:39] now nobody wouldn't say that Christ
[7:40] didn't raise amen
[7:43] all right
[7:45] they wouldn't do with that see they hold
[7:46] that point but it's just the rest of it
[7:48] all right whom he raised whom he raised
[7:51] not up if so be that the Dead Rising on
[7:55] or if the dead rise not then is Christ
[7:57] not raised all right
[8:01] and if Christ be not raised your faith
[8:03] is vain
[8:04] you are yet in your sins
[8:07] then you all they also which are falling
[8:10] asleep in Christ are perished
[8:14] if in this lot only we have hope in
[8:17] Christ we are of all men most miserable
[8:20] you may be seated over that is blessing
[8:22] to the reading of the word now I know
[8:26] that's plain language
[8:28] but I didn't write it amen I just read
[8:31] it that's that's the point you know
[8:34] and I think the word is true don't you
[8:37] yeah
[8:38] even in this message now after all the
[8:40] prophet is said in times that there are
[8:43] those that teach that there will not be
[8:45] a physical Resurrection
[8:48] um you know and uh I tried to listen
[8:50] earnestly to it the person that I heard
[8:52] was talking about it and uh you know I
[8:56] uh couldn't understand because like I
[8:59] said
[8:59] I know someone said you know well we
[9:02] don't race physically we raise in some
[9:04] kind of a theophany and then after we go
[9:07] through the Millennium and all of the
[9:09] things and then somewhere in the future
[9:11] home we get back with our body well I
[9:13] don't understand that I just I don't get
[9:15] it because Jesus didn't raise that away
[9:17] and you know he was the resurrection and
[9:21] the scripture here says that you don't
[9:23] don't believe in the resurrection you're
[9:24] still in your sins
[9:25] that's plain enough you know I don't
[9:28] have to interpret that I just read it in
[9:31] you know trying to get to that point now
[9:35] but what I want to talk about
[9:38] this morning is just a little message on
[9:40] my heart will start this afternoon on
[9:42] the uh you know in the study of the Book
[9:45] of Revelations leading up to chapter
[9:48] five all right but this has just been a
[9:52] message I've had on my heart for a while
[9:54] and I want to preach it this morning but
[9:56] now see I believe
[9:59] that we have proof
[10:02] of the resurrection and that's the title
[10:04] of the message
[10:05] that now here
[10:08] among us we don't have to wait we'll get
[10:11] to some of the things later and see I
[10:13] come down through some of the baddest
[10:15] doctrinal situations and some of you
[10:17] come from your churches and and what was
[10:19] taught about it and you know people will
[10:22] say well yeah we don't believe in in
[10:24] Divine Healing but we believe one of
[10:27] these days it'll all be done to set away
[10:29] or the other well you know I'm not
[10:31] arguing with nobody I'm just saying that
[10:34] uh I just don't see it that way because
[10:36] see God has given us proof
[10:39] that right now Among Us is already proof
[10:44] of the Resurrection we don't have to
[10:46] wait you know till a time comes it's
[10:50] already proof of that and it's Divine
[10:52] Healing amen all right now we're going
[10:54] from Divine Healing on in a minute we'll
[10:56] go over to to uh
[10:58] when we get in there where the Throne of
[11:00] righteousness will rise with healing is
[11:02] winning but I want to hold it to the
[11:04] point of thinking of Divine Healing and
[11:07] what it's talking about now I know and
[11:10] the reason they differed was run around
[11:11] them on a lot of things about it well
[11:13] see when you say Divine and they put out
[11:16] you know Divine healer come into town
[11:18] Etc now brother random emphatically
[11:20] stated over and over if you'd like these
[11:22] I could find them in a hurry for you uh
[11:25] he said I'm not a Divine healer he said
[11:28] even Jesus
[11:31] that's right was not a Divine healer
[11:33] amen he said he said that he had done
[11:36] only what the father showed him all
[11:39] right so then you know we're not talking
[11:41] about that and that's why the people
[11:43] don't misunderstood right around because
[11:45] when it would advertise Divine Healing
[11:48] see then they would take the word divine
[11:50] and they would interpret it and being
[11:53] you know and saying well Divine Healing
[11:56] you know this this person that believed
[11:58] in Divine Healing well then they bring
[12:01] their Doctrine as we'll cover them in it
[12:03] uh of saying well we don't believe in
[12:05] Divine Healing until the whole product
[12:07] is taken care of you know uh in the
[12:10] Mortal put on immortality well okay
[12:13] that's fine
[12:14] but you're leaving off your proof of the
[12:16] Resurrection you're leaving off the
[12:18] truth of the entire Bible that would
[12:21] show you know where we're at and what
[12:24] we're doing we don't have to wait to a
[12:26] time to come to have proof of things you
[12:29] know we can have it here while we're
[12:31] alive and and taking care of it but see
[12:33] Divine Healing then is the earnest
[12:37] of the Resurrection but it's proof of
[12:40] the Resurrection
[12:42] no Divine Healing now how many times do
[12:45] you want that off the prophet we'll read
[12:46] a good many of them but no Divine
[12:49] Healing no Resurrection all right
[12:52] now so if there's no Divine Healing then
[12:56] you know
[12:58] we don't have to worry about it we're
[13:00] just a glorified monkey off of the tree
[13:02] you know amen and we're just fall and go
[13:04] to the grave and don't worry about it
[13:06] you know but if we're going to believe
[13:08] in Christianity and the truth of the
[13:11] Bible then we're going to try to
[13:13] understand what it is and what's taking
[13:16] place all right but see now like I said
[13:19] people say well we don't believe in a
[13:20] Redemption of the body
[13:23] but we believe in the Redemption of Soul
[13:25] the prophet said the same word for
[13:28] salvation for the body is the same word
[13:30] for salvation for the soul he said it's
[13:33] the same word he said then it's all
[13:34] applied and he said now if Jesus Christ
[13:38] died let me get me the question to you
[13:40] and I
[13:42] then if he died in Rose then Redemption
[13:47] was over before the foundation of the
[13:49] world
[13:51] because God knew before would be saved
[13:54] and who wouldn't amen that's the first
[13:55] Doctrine to hit us when they come into
[13:57] message they're into in the late 60s was
[14:00] you couldn't be saved after 63 you know
[14:02] Redemption was over when the seal was
[14:04] broken Etc and uh I said well according
[14:07] to the Bible it said it was over for the
[14:08] world ever begun amen and so that's all
[14:11] right I'm not going to worry about it
[14:13] but now think of it
[14:15] Divine Healing
[14:18] is the earnest
[14:22] of the Resurrection in other words it's
[14:24] proof yes
[14:27] the if there's anybody in the world
[14:29] today anywhere or has ever
[14:33] been anybody since the foundation of the
[14:36] world
[14:37] because Divine Healing was in the Old
[14:38] Testament under the atonement as well as
[14:40] the New Testament all right
[14:42] but if any one person
[14:45] get my point now I'd like to drive it
[14:47] down this way if any one person was ever
[14:50] healed
[14:53] then that was Divine Healing
[14:56] and proof of the Resurrection all right
[14:59] if any one person
[15:03] would ever be saved any word down
[15:06] through time has been or whatever
[15:09] then it proves there is a God and let's
[15:12] say here
[15:13] and it proves that he did raise from the
[15:16] dead amen all right so then we don't
[15:18] have to worry about it we say we
[15:20] understand that right you know we're
[15:22] we're following that point but I want
[15:24] you to to think about it a little a
[15:27] little stronger today than what we've
[15:30] thought about it
[15:32] oh Divine Healing being an earnest
[15:35] of the Resurrection
[15:37] you know a down payment a part payment
[15:41] of the Resurrection our proof
[15:44] of the Resurrection
[15:45] and like I said now if you've ever been
[15:47] healed the proof is not that we read
[15:49] we'll read them into where your
[15:51] Resurrection is even inside of you right
[15:55] right because this is not an outside
[15:56] thing now talk about something somewhere
[15:59] else it's inside of us all right but
[16:01] let's get started on just reading and
[16:03] let the prophet of God say a few things
[16:05] to us and just try to come in along the
[16:07] way as we go and see what he's had to
[16:10] say about this and you say well why are
[16:12] you using it because we believe in it
[16:16] all right but do we believe in it in the
[16:19] correct way
[16:21] God would spend so much time to do all
[16:24] of these things and then we uh come
[16:28] along and say well I've read it I
[16:30] believe it
[16:32] no
[16:33] all right we we there's a lot of
[16:35] sickness Among Us right
[16:38] if nothing else there's a lot of old age
[16:39] Among Us okay
[16:42] yeah
[16:44] but see there's a lot of sickness Among
[16:46] Us
[16:47] so we need healing
[16:51] but are we trying to get healed
[16:56] to be by begging God to heal us Etc
[17:00] little Abby Grace Satan straightened her
[17:02] grandmother out nanny
[17:04] one day when Nanny was talking about
[17:06] something about feeling so bad and
[17:09] little Abbey Grace is five years old
[17:11] today's her birthday and she's not here
[17:13] of course and a sick this month but
[17:16] anyhow little Abby Grace said Nanny
[17:18] you're not supposed to say that you're
[17:21] supposed to say that you're well
[17:24] something to that order at least she's
[17:27] hurt so if she's corrected you know out
[17:30] of the amount of baits you know come
[17:32] forth wisdom all right because of
[17:35] confession
[17:37] see how do you get healed
[17:40] by begging God to heal you no
[17:45] no
[17:46] asking him to heal you yes
[17:48] but really the healing comes by the fact
[17:52] of stating that he has already done it
[17:57] and that what we need to do is thank him
[18:01] for it
[18:02] now that's hard to do sometimes when
[18:05] you're sick when you're hurting and all
[18:08] this that and the other it's hard to to
[18:10] say buy Stripes I'm Healed
[18:13] you know
[18:15] when we're we're feeling so bad
[18:17] but what else are we going to say
[18:20] but is that statement though now here's
[18:22] my point for the whole message is that
[18:24] statement that we make we're going to
[18:26] say I'm already healed all right now
[18:30] keep confessing that
[18:32] until it comes to pies amen all right
[18:35] and the main thing until it comes to
[18:37] pasting you not you know not the healing
[18:40] taking place but to it comes to the
[18:43] place that you can say within yourself
[18:59] but see you you've got to say what God
[19:03] says but now to just verbally say the
[19:06] words
[19:08] foreign
[19:09] to verbally say the words
[19:13] that's wonderful but that's a confession
[19:16] and you're confessing there now listen
[19:19] without a possession
[19:23] and that's good just keep confessing it
[19:25] for sure don't lose your confession all
[19:28] right all right but when it comes to a
[19:31] time to worry that that it just comes
[19:33] over you and you say I'm Healed
[19:36] and then it don't matter how long it
[19:38] takes
[19:41] it no matter how long it takes
[19:44] it takes this
[19:46] you had it amen to call that Faith all
[19:49] right
[19:50] now you understand what I'm saying then
[19:52] we've got to confess it until it comes
[19:54] to a possession
[19:56] but that's where a problem is like I've
[19:58] always tried to describe to you and I'm
[20:00] I'm sorry I just be I'm honest but you
[20:02] see people say we're cancer
[20:04] and they hold on
[20:07] when they're told they got cancer they
[20:09] say bye Stripes I'm Healed I want
[20:11] everybody to know it put it in the
[20:12] newspaper put it on these all of these
[20:14] things websites and send it to everybody
[20:16] that I'm Healed
[20:18] oh God says I'm Healed and I believe it
[20:21] all right
[20:24] but then after about three or four
[20:25] months things starts getting a little
[20:27] worse
[20:28] you know their testimony begins to
[20:30] dwindle away and sure they'll say oh
[20:33] yeah I I still believe that I'm Healed
[20:37] um
[20:39] but I think I better go to the doctor
[20:41] well let's do it you would have went and
[20:44] start with
[20:45] no problem we're going the first time
[20:47] amen but then you start saying what the
[20:50] doctor says
[20:52] then you'll start propping it up okay
[20:54] now I've got this cancer and and what
[20:57] I'm doing I'm trying to show you you're
[20:59] losing your faith
[21:01] all right because you can do that for
[21:03] healing you can lose your faith
[21:05] that's right and you start saying well
[21:06] you know maybe they need me as a guinea
[21:09] pig
[21:10] to try this new medicine
[21:12] so let's try but I still healed God's A
[21:16] Healer no you just lost your confession
[21:19] you're back to a mental thought right
[21:23] you're back to saying what the word says
[21:25] but not possessing
[21:28] the reality of it and here I start
[21:31] coughing okay
[21:33] my stripes on heels
[21:38] all right but see in doing that then if
[21:41] we lose our confession
[21:44] it's not God's fault
[21:47] it's ours
[21:49] the sickness comes back if you heard the
[21:51] prophet say it like this he said you can
[21:53] be healed of something today he said
[21:54] tomorrow can come back because healing
[21:57] is not Eternal right right that's why
[21:59] they just sent a moment ago they they
[22:01] had problems with the way that it was
[22:03] said about Divine Healing through
[22:04] brother Brown's Ministry because they
[22:07] would take the word divine as being like
[22:09] Eternal right and then you could never
[22:13] get sick again
[22:14] well see that's not correct right around
[22:16] never talk nothing like that the Bible
[22:17] don't teach nothing like that
[22:20] all right
[22:21] see then getting now to the point
[22:25] Divine Healing
[22:28] if there is no Divine Healing then there
[22:31] is no Resurrection all right but now
[22:34] here's where we get down and we dwindle
[22:36] on that
[22:37] and we take that as no Divine Healing no
[22:39] Resurrection when I'm sick
[22:42] I'm sick
[22:45] but that don't have anything to do with
[22:47] the resurrection
[22:49] huh
[22:51] but you see then we lose our faith by
[22:54] our confession of negativism by saying
[22:57] you know
[23:00] and even try to say it this way we say I
[23:03] I know it's him you can't tell me I
[23:05] ain't healed
[23:06] well who you're arguing with amen
[23:09] you arguing with me are you arguing with
[23:12] God about it
[23:14] but then when you say no Divine Healing
[23:16] no Resurrection we're not having any
[23:18] signs of Wonders Among Us so we're
[23:21] wondering what about the resurrection
[23:22] now you surely have got into a bad trap
[23:25] of the devil
[23:28] because
[23:29] I don't care if God never heals anybody
[23:31] else
[23:33] he is the Healer I don't care if he ever
[23:36] saves anybody else
[23:38] he was a savior amen
[23:40] why can't we actually say it that way
[23:42] but see we always want to have some kind
[23:45] of assumption to prop it up with
[23:48] or to to base it upon well we've seen
[23:50] this we've seen that oh back in brother
[23:52] Brown's Ministry you know they had
[23:54] healings and signs and wonders
[23:57] now there's a statement I want to make
[24:00] to you
[24:01] thank you
[24:02] I wish you'd write this down
[24:05] during the time
[24:07] because we'll get back to it in a little
[24:09] while
[24:09] of the greatest
[24:13] and of signs and wonders
[24:17] that the world has ever seen and I'll
[24:19] give it to you in a minute we're brought
[24:20] around said that there's more people
[24:22] healed in one of his meetings than even
[24:24] is written in the Bible of the Lord
[24:27] Jesus but he said now the Lord Jesus
[24:29] doesn't it he never took no credit right
[24:32] all right we get what I'm saying
[24:34] during the time of the greatest healing
[24:37] campaigns that the world ever existed
[24:40] you know ever saw
[24:43] right worldwide we talk about revivals
[24:46] being worldwide this was a Divine
[24:48] Healing campaign that stripped the world
[24:51] right all right during that time is when
[24:54] the prophet made the statements no
[24:56] Divine Healing
[24:58] no Resurrection
[25:00] I wish you'd write that down put it in
[25:03] your computer home you know what I'm
[25:04] talking about your brain
[25:06] let it float around up there a while and
[25:09] maybe it'll drop down a little lower you
[25:11] know to get into the soul
[25:13] but just think about it
[25:15] how many times go run it in your
[25:17] computer I don't I didn't look it up and
[25:19] see how many times but I'm sure it would
[25:21] go into 40 50 times or more that the
[25:24] prophet said no Divine Healing no
[25:26] Resurrection
[25:28] during the time that he would say bring
[25:31] me 24 of your worst cases and I'll
[25:34] guarantee you healing for every one of
[25:36] them
[25:38] during the time that he would say more
[25:41] healings in one one service than it's
[25:45] written in the Bible amen
[25:51] it's during that time he was making no
[25:53] statements
[25:55] well what's he talking about
[25:59] surely he's not talking about that there
[26:01] was not any signs and wonders because
[26:03] they were worldwide amen
[26:07] well what is he dealing with
[26:12] what is he dealing with
[26:15] what does Divine Healing speak of now
[26:17] let's get him to a go ahead and pull up
[26:19] number one brother and let's read a
[26:20] little bit
[26:22] of what the prophet had to say
[26:25] this was the message of the ten virgins
[26:27] paragraphs 11.
[26:30] now I underlined to emphasize but you
[26:33] underline the whole plan
[26:35] all right
[26:36] and I do believe in Divine Healing it's
[26:38] one of the greatest doctrines of the
[26:40] Bible that was 1960 12 11 in the morning
[26:42] series
[26:44] but Divine Healing has more to it than
[26:47] just Divine Healing amen
[26:51] Divine Healing only says that there is a
[26:54] God who's coming again now if you
[26:57] isolated that statement you would have a
[26:59] very negative point
[27:02] Divine Healing only
[27:05] says
[27:08] so you you emphasize the only and you're
[27:10] breaking it down very narrow but if you
[27:12] boost up the only you're getting it in
[27:14] the right order divide him even when he
[27:16] says that there's a God who's coming
[27:18] again it means he's he's going to be
[27:20] here he's going to come huh
[27:23] what does Divine Healing speak of it's
[27:26] the earnest of the Resurrection
[27:33] see and if there is no Holy Spirit now
[27:36] to baptize us there is no eternal life
[27:39] in the world to come
[27:41] I like the way he makes statements don't
[27:43] you
[27:44] right those are straight plain and don't
[27:46] need to be interpreted do they
[27:49] the Bible said this is the earnest of
[27:52] our salvation and you know what the
[27:54] earnest is it's the down payment see if
[27:56] you'll go down and pay say you bought a
[27:58] farm you just wanted to put the money
[28:00] down but what is it the baptism of the
[28:02] holy spirit is just the earnest of
[28:04] what's coming
[28:05] or what will it be like then amen Divine
[28:09] Healing is an earnest
[28:13] of a glorified
[28:15] Eternal Body amen
[28:19] now the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:23] is the earnest
[28:26] of the completion of redemption
[28:29] that would take us to a change of the
[28:31] body
[28:33] so we don't have the baptism of the Holy
[28:35] Ghost we're in bad shape to start with
[28:38] right
[28:40] it's for everybody right
[28:44] but everybody won't receive it that's
[28:46] right right salvation is for everybody
[28:50] but everybody won't receive it amen all
[28:53] right
[28:54] so now whose problem is it is our
[28:56] problem
[28:57] see we reject
[28:59] the way that God does things
[29:03] you know
[29:04] and then we try to figure it out
[29:08] and then we quote somebody else who was
[29:10] it buddy Robinson I believe it was I
[29:12] heard about this preacher one time say
[29:14] that too and I believe it was Buddy
[29:15] Robinson went out in the cornfield who
[29:17] was it looked around referred to was
[29:19] there and he said God if you don't save
[29:22] me said you'll find a pile of bone
[29:23] sitting right here amen well I heard
[29:25] that statement before I come in dementia
[29:28] of people you know that would make that
[29:30] shape see that was more or less a
[29:32] positive statement well I now the one
[29:35] wrote around was talking about got the
[29:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:39] but now that's just saying what somebody
[29:41] else says all right
[29:44] see I extend your talk to you all day
[29:46] about the healings that God has done in
[29:48] his body but you know that will not do
[29:50] you any good and right
[29:53] unless you believe it
[29:55] my blood type had totally been changed
[29:57] from a positive to a negative medically
[30:01] proven
[30:04] medically proven the doctors is the one
[30:07] that said it huh
[30:09] but see they don't I won't heal you
[30:12] but all that does is shows you as we're
[30:14] reading there then God is here
[30:18] if you hear one person why wouldn't he
[30:19] heal anybody out well we say well maybe
[30:22] it's not for me that's exactly right
[30:24] it's not for you if you believe that
[30:26] that's it
[30:30] it's not for you because your confession
[30:32] is wrong but what is Divine Healing
[30:35] speak of now
[30:37] Divine Healing only is only the earnest
[30:40] but it says that there is a God who's
[30:42] coming right
[30:46] all right
[30:47] Divine Healing says there's a God that's
[30:49] coming
[30:51] because it has to tie on over to
[30:53] immortality In the Flesh to take this
[30:55] one out of here in the coming of the
[30:57] Lord right we'll get to that in a moment
[31:01] but Divine Healing
[31:03] it speaks of greater things than just
[31:06] healing the prophet see it it speaks of
[31:10] the Resurrection amen
[31:12] R is proof
[31:16] of the Resurrection
[31:18] all right
[31:19] now as I said
[31:22] if you've ever been healed you've had
[31:24] proof in your body amen
[31:28] if you've ever seen anybody else that
[31:30] was healed you had proof in your body in
[31:33] the body you got it there you can see it
[31:34] all right
[31:36] well now let's just get into earnestly
[31:38] thinking
[31:40] see because here's where the Prophet go
[31:41] ahead with number two
[31:43] he says I'm actually called phase
[31:44] paragraph 1 1961 813.
[31:49] when you've got to use faith in when
[31:52] you've got to use faith in God to make
[31:54] it work see so you've got your own
[31:57] Resurrection inside of you
[32:02] so now the heroes inside of you amen if
[32:05] the resurrection is inside of you that's
[32:07] right the savior is inside of you
[32:11] all right no if you're born again
[32:14] all right now the reason an actual
[32:16] person to make sure nobody don't
[32:17] misunderstand it to a natural person not
[32:19] born again can receive healing
[32:27] they believe it but they don't have an
[32:30] inside person to confess their heel so
[32:33] they're only doing it from their mental
[32:35] conception and it produces well what
[32:37] about a born-again Christian
[32:41] I believe this is what you're talking
[32:42] about don't you
[32:44] yeah you talking about a born-again
[32:45] Christian that has laying inside of you
[32:48] your Resurrection right
[32:52] Resurrection is not laid inside of a
[32:54] sinner
[32:56] come on
[32:59] it's land inside of the true born-again
[33:01] Christian the other is a mental concept
[33:03] that produces
[33:05] and you go beyond your natural thinking
[33:07] until you can believe it and be healed
[33:09] you see people walking across the
[33:11] platform healed healed healed and then a
[33:13] Christian
[33:14] lose it not get it amen
[33:17] is that true good luck see your
[33:20] Resurrection lays inside of you and your
[33:22] spirit
[33:23] now you know when Jesus died on the
[33:24] cross his soul descended into hell then
[33:27] preached to the souls that were in
[33:28] prison that repented not in the long
[33:30] suffering and they don't know his body
[33:31] went into the grave but before he died
[33:33] he committed his Spirit into the hands
[33:34] of God into the hands into thy hands
[33:38] commit my spirit
[33:40] so you see his Spirit went to God his
[33:43] soul went to hell his body went to the
[33:45] grave but now that spirit that was in
[33:48] him was the spirit of God and that
[33:51] spirit and sundered times and diverse
[33:52] matters anointed the prophets to bring
[33:54] the message to the people in the last
[33:56] days through Christ and now in these
[33:57] days through the gospel all right so
[33:59] what are we talking about
[34:00] your soul is being his person his spirit
[34:05] we can go through explaining the
[34:06] difference in Soul and Spirit to do
[34:08] we're in the early Ministry in a way he
[34:10] brought it and then he brought it into
[34:11] the later in the ministry to show him
[34:14] because in the early Ministry he put
[34:15] Body Soul spirit
[34:18] but in the later Ministries it was Body
[34:20] Spirit and soul but it doesn't matter he
[34:23] was explaining the you you don't have to
[34:25] worry about whether or not he corrected
[34:27] that he always said the body has five
[34:29] cents and she takes Fields metal here
[34:30] the second Rim whatever you call it
[34:33] you want to call it Joe Jim or Charlie
[34:36] it still would be counted five cents it
[34:38] reads the memory conscious effect then
[34:40] the inner Center Rim only had one chance
[34:43] all right so now get what are you saying
[34:46] Jesus went to hell
[34:50] his soul went to hell
[34:52] what raised him
[34:56] the Bible says if
[34:59] the spirit that was in him that raised
[35:01] him from the dead
[35:04] be in you that's right
[35:07] it will Quicken or make alive your
[35:10] mortal body amen truth and all we got to
[35:13] worry about is whether we got the new
[35:14] birth or not and that's where the
[35:16] Prophet said the most important thing in
[35:18] your life is whether you're mourning it
[35:20] or not and well people nowadays don't
[35:22] even kick the new birth they're so
[35:23] glorified into the message and throw
[35:25] anointed and so up into the great Realms
[35:28] of the of the the what they call them
[35:30] actually until they don't even talk
[35:32] about the New Birth anymore
[35:36] have you heard even somebody preaching
[35:38] justification sanctification of baptism
[35:40] and all another
[35:42] now that we're beyond that
[35:44] you'll be on what
[35:47] I mean you kind of got your foundation
[35:49] Knocked Down Under yet amen right
[35:52] you kind of mentioned it up all right
[35:54] but now think about it
[35:58] think about what's being said
[36:00] all right
[36:04] within him laid the resurrection
[36:09] Within You by the new birth
[36:12] lays that same Resurrection
[36:16] all right
[36:18] so now fishing with inside of you why
[36:20] are you hunting from somewhere else
[36:22] man why are you trying to Pump It Up
[36:25] prime it up
[36:27] no now I I don't want to listen I know I
[36:30] say things that I shouldn't say but I
[36:32] just try to make a point
[36:36] I know a people that you've heard of
[36:38] them probably and probably might have
[36:39] done it but I know some brothers told me
[36:41] one time that they played tapes 24 hours
[36:43] a day in their home
[36:46] well that's wonderful now I'm not saying
[36:48] anything against that heaven forbid I'm
[36:50] not talking against it I'm just saying
[36:53] plain language
[36:55] what good did it do that's right
[37:04] and people like to take all of the you
[37:06] know do it and I try to they take all of
[37:09] the healing campaign you know all of the
[37:11] healing lines are the prophet and they
[37:13] put it out into tapes where you can just
[37:15] play it over and over and over and over
[37:18] and over
[37:19] well let's do it
[37:22] maybe there's something in there will
[37:24] cause a mental connection to be able to
[37:26] bring somebody to heal it
[37:29] but you know I never have understood all
[37:31] about how people had to do everything
[37:33] because
[37:35] and I believe firmly in Divine Healing
[37:39] I've done confession activities okay if
[37:42] you want to hear some more about the
[37:43] things that was in this body that was
[37:46] corrected you you just would talk about
[37:48] it
[37:49] because I've seen it done I've seen
[37:52] everything but blinded eyes open and
[37:54] sister back there we're certainly
[37:56] praying about that and believing it the
[37:59] dead rays are still healed and
[38:00] everything else so we believe in Divine
[38:02] Healing so now when I make this
[38:04] statement don't misunderstand it
[38:07] you know that the greatest prophet
[38:10] of all the Bible speaks of and we're not
[38:13] talking about brother random in this day
[38:15] John the Baptist amen
[38:18] John the Baptist
[38:20] the introducer of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:25] the man who stood there
[38:27] to do the greatest work that could ever
[38:29] be and not one
[38:32] shine following his ministry
[38:35] amen well yeah we build everything on
[38:38] signs and wonders
[38:41] well that's a good reason I believe in
[38:44] it but it also be the devil's trap too
[38:47] because you know yourself there's more
[38:50] of the many hens and the the people
[38:52] that's out there now on the healings
[38:53] that are taking place that's right right
[38:55] why don't you just go out there with him
[38:59] I mean what's holding you here
[39:02] if you're looking for signs and wonders
[39:05] now come on folks and then I'm telling
[39:07] you there's nobody in this building that
[39:08] leaves and signs and wonders more than
[39:09] this man does
[39:11] because I've seen it
[39:13] I walked out and I've confessed it until
[39:15] it come to pass
[39:17] all right
[39:18] yeah so in doing that then what are we
[39:20] talking about
[39:22] in the greatest time of all that could
[39:25] be here are the statements the prophet
[39:27] is saying
[39:28] the greatest healing campaigns that ever
[39:30] struck the world
[39:32] and he's saying no Divine Healing no
[39:35] Resurrection
[39:41] and he says it speaks of greater things
[39:46] let's think about that boy number three
[39:48] really
[39:49] respect to enjoy 57 18
[39:54] 67.
[39:57] if Jesus is raised from the dead
[40:00] listen
[40:03] if it's for me and you that's not for
[40:05] him right he's not infinite he's not
[40:08] wondering where it's right or not
[40:09] when the Bible said if the spirit that
[40:12] was in him and that's not wondering
[40:14] about whether it's right or not that
[40:15] could even if you and I all right if
[40:18] Jesus Christ is raised in the dead then
[40:21] then he's already healed
[40:26] he's already saved
[40:30] they ain't be talking about an
[40:31] individual above here
[40:35] but he's talking about truth right
[40:37] that's right that if Jesus Christ is
[40:40] raised in the Dead
[40:41] then the healing is over with
[40:45] the Salvation is over with amen
[40:48] it's whether or not we can believe it
[40:52] right right
[40:53] he's not going to die again
[40:57] he's not going to be beaten again for
[40:59] the blood for our stride you know he
[41:01] looks already done it simple language
[41:04] right
[41:06] he took away your worry he's Jehovah's
[41:08] original he's Jehovah Rapha he's every
[41:12] name tonight that he was then he is now
[41:15] and the blood of Christ has covered and
[41:18] redeemed you from everything that Adam
[41:20] did to you
[41:21] now you don't have
[41:23] you don't have it in the fullness
[41:27] I'm watching
[41:28] I mean this is a man standing there to
[41:30] guaranteed
[41:32] healing for 24 cases you know and
[41:35] nobody's ever done that outside the Lord
[41:36] Jesus
[41:39] but he's telling you
[41:41] but you don't have it in the formation
[41:45] huh
[41:46] but you have it as the earnest of your
[41:49] salvation
[41:51] if there's no Divine Healing there's no
[41:54] Resurrection now there's that statement
[41:55] is he running it too
[41:58] no signs and wonders taking place
[42:03] when they were taking place no we're
[42:05] telling how many people was healed in
[42:06] this minute and this message it is I'm
[42:08] quoting from
[42:09] what does he saying
[42:16] if there's no but you have it as the
[42:19] earnest of your salvation the baptism of
[42:21] the Holy Ghost is the earnest
[42:24] amen your soul the prophet Africa got it
[42:27] in here he said your soul is not
[42:28] complete man my code is not Phoenix
[42:31] that's the factor of perfect man that's
[42:33] all the things that's coming up in
[42:35] adoption and all of that
[42:37] all right
[42:40] now your healing is not complete because
[42:43] you can be healed today sick tomorrow
[42:46] all right but you've got the earnest of
[42:49] it right all right
[42:51] let's see if there's no Divine Healing
[42:53] there's no Resurrection that's right if
[42:56] there's no joy in the Lord then there's
[42:57] no joy there in the Lord
[43:00] we just got the earnest that's the down
[43:02] payment of the
[43:04] what would it be when we see him and get
[43:06] the full value of his Redemption
[43:08] man man
[43:10] I said when they said divine
[43:14] Divine see the preachers immediately
[43:16] picked up and began to say Divine healer
[43:21] oh this guy thinks he's going to heal
[43:23] you
[43:25] and he said I can't do that
[43:27] he said if even Jesus was standing here
[43:33] in this suit of clothes on and I said he
[43:35] couldn't heal you man
[43:37] my brother I think he wouldn't remember
[43:39] what well is that right or wrong
[43:41] and
[43:42] he's already healed us
[43:46] he's already saved us
[43:51] all we got to do is confess it amen
[43:54] until we possess it
[43:57] keep on saying it
[44:03] keep on saying it don't ride over my
[44:05] tombstone he died for this right away he
[44:07] just got wore out
[44:13] but now listen
[44:16] listen
[44:18] God's Commission
[44:21] commissioning Moses 1963 606. he's 16.
[44:29] now listen
[44:30] he's talking about Dr best right
[44:33] and when they had the meeting up there
[44:34] and you know the pillar fire came down
[44:36] and I think well you know what he said
[44:38] Dr Beth when they finally turned it over
[44:40] to him uh you know
[44:42] Dr vest preached him a good Camelot
[44:44] sermon
[44:47] now
[44:48] that's not talking about Alexander
[44:51] Campbell
[44:53] he was in on those parts but a good
[44:55] Methodist or good bad discernment
[45:00] probably like you do now but you know
[45:03] you wasn't even listening
[45:07] listen to what Dr best says
[45:10] and see if it if you can remember when
[45:13] you heard it that way
[45:20] he said I was robbed in a Bagless Trail
[45:24] and that's something for a prophet to
[45:26] say that
[45:28] I know what Baptist Doctrine is
[45:33] he preached now here's the Baptist
[45:35] Doctrine
[45:37] he said no no we bad this we didn't
[45:39] here's the Baptist doctor and that's
[45:40] what your Prophet is saying amen
[45:44] huh
[45:46] he preached that after this Mortal
[45:49] immortality when this Mortal puts on
[45:51] immortality that'll be Divine Healing
[45:55] and that's Baptist doctor in other words
[45:58] he means that's organized religion
[45:59] Doctrine amen now
[46:02] watch it
[46:04] he said well sure
[46:07] we'll tell you when there's more to put
[46:09] you on immortality that'll be Divine
[46:11] Healing sure we play that
[46:14] but if you're sitting here saying we
[46:16] believe that we believe in Divine when
[46:18] it takes place but there's no healing
[46:20] now
[46:21] we're just here in this world and we
[46:23] gotta go to the doctor and we got to do
[46:26] this and we got to do that you know
[46:29] and that's what people turn out to be
[46:32] looked
[46:34] well sure we all believe that but what
[46:37] about this if there's if we have no
[46:40] Earnest of our salvation
[46:43] the blessing that we have in our heart
[46:45] of the baptism of the holy spirit is the
[46:48] earnest watching them are the down
[46:50] payment if there's no Divine Healing
[46:54] there's no resurrection of the body amen
[46:59] there's no Earnest of it so we have the
[47:02] earnest of our Salvation now amen
[47:08] see we have within us as we're quoting
[47:10] there a moment ago our own Resurrection
[47:12] lays within us not our Resurrection
[47:16] no more than run around they'd say well
[47:17] you know so many people were healed he
[47:19] said Jesus done it amen
[47:22] to Jesus in my Ministry heal more than
[47:25] one service
[47:27] than he did in the written writing of
[47:29] the Bible he's not talking about himself
[47:32] man
[47:33] let's see salvation
[47:36] we have the blessings of Salvation which
[47:39] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:42] we have the blessing of the
[47:45] Divine Healing for our bodies
[47:47] which is the earnest
[47:50] of a glorified body
[47:53] and we'll read that in a minute
[47:55] the earnest of our body to be able to
[47:57] make it glorified is the fact that it
[47:59] can be healed now amen what are we
[48:03] talking about
[48:04] he not just talking about no Divine will
[48:06] ain't no Divine Healing ain't no
[48:08] Resurrection or nothing so we just don't
[48:10] see nothing I keep emphasizing that
[48:13] during the time that this man would
[48:15] guarantee healing for
[48:17] people
[48:19] he's saying these statements
[48:23] oh no Divine Healing no Resurrection
[48:29] now I sure would want to see a whole lot
[48:32] more
[48:35] of God
[48:38] um
[48:39] but if he never healed anybody else
[48:43] I'm still anchoring what he said
[48:48] all right see if we can be that then we
[48:50] don't have to worry about it
[48:52] the cause of life and the things like
[48:53] that won't worry us look at the next one
[48:59] E7 which is 1951 718.
[49:06] not healing now there's no resurrection
[49:08] of the
[49:11] place right on this thing
[49:16] Divine Healing is the earnest of our
[49:18] redeemed body
[49:22] uh surely we would understand that if
[49:24] God and God can give you plenty of these
[49:26] we'll run around and talk about a person
[49:28] you know cancer eating up person laying
[49:31] there and he said in a matter of a few
[49:33] minutes see him standing up walking and
[49:34] thinking amen
[49:37] see if we can believe that church why
[49:39] can't we believe what Divine Healing is
[49:41] earnest of our redeemed body
[49:46] Resurrection amen
[49:50] all right
[49:51] now
[49:53] if there's no Divine Healing then when
[49:55] you go at the grave
[49:57] that's all of it
[50:00] but nobody even
[50:03] when you go to grave that's all of it
[50:06] you'll be there forever and your dust
[50:08] will go away and there will be no more
[50:10] of you
[50:13] that's pretty blonde isn't it amen
[50:16] seeing if we have the earnest of our
[50:18] salvation
[50:19] and completeness back the way we was in
[50:22] the Garden of Eden all right now watch
[50:24] and I think that the power of God that
[50:27] would take a cancer-ridden woman here
[50:29] that the doctors had just give a few
[50:31] days and she's one of the thousands
[50:33] that's on record not just the man the
[50:36] person's testimony but the doctor's
[50:38] testimony one of the thousands and her
[50:41] eat up with a few hours to live my
[50:44] cancer and by the earnest of her
[50:46] redeemed body
[50:49] will put her in
[50:52] the condition it is now in other words
[50:54] healing
[51:01] right and the condition is that what
[51:03] would it be when she draws the full
[51:05] value of the resurrection of Jesus
[51:07] Christ
[51:08] man that's just the down you know what
[51:11] the down Easter initiative part payment
[51:12] and that cancer and everything like that
[51:15] she's sitting well to normal
[51:19] see that not only just speaks of a
[51:22] healing God
[51:25] that speaks of a glorified body
[51:29] so there's no Divine Healing there's no
[51:30] glorified body
[51:33] huh
[51:34] put time together the glorified body
[51:36] it's not tied together just that if
[51:38] there's no healing
[51:41] than what we got we're going out there
[51:44] then
[51:45] I mean I'm honest I don't have no
[51:47] problem
[51:49] I just try to be in what I am all the
[51:52] time this is the way I talk every time
[51:53] all the services not just one
[51:57] you know me this church was never built
[51:59] on the basis and tried to beg somebody
[52:00] to come to church
[52:02] it's never been built on that I know I'm
[52:04] not a good pastor I agree with you 100
[52:09] the most pastors when somebody lays out
[52:11] of church they call them up want to know
[52:12] what's wrong
[52:13] I don't know care about hearing when I
[52:16] understand
[52:22] I just don't turn them back here and all
[52:24] that so I just don't do it
[52:26] if I'm wrong I'm wrong I'm sorry you're
[52:29] supposed to call me it doesn't say in
[52:31] the Bible for the pastor to call a sick
[52:33] to pray for him
[52:35] he said if you're sick call the pastor
[52:39] for the elders or somebody yeah it's not
[52:42] just the bases and this church ain't
[52:44] been built on trying to beg people to
[52:46] come
[52:48] you know I know I ain't no no good at it
[52:50] and I'm sorry but it's just not built
[52:52] that way it's built on one thing whether
[52:54] the word is here or not man I did not
[52:58] take care of the rest of it right but
[53:00] you see what he's talking about
[53:03] the full value of the resurrection of
[53:06] Jesus Christ
[53:10] see when he raised
[53:14] he not only
[53:17] healed
[53:20] because that was the only way that the
[53:22] life that was within him
[53:24] could come out of him it was a death
[53:27] amen and when he raised
[53:31] me no wonder the scripture said he is
[53:33] risen and let's say he has risen or was
[53:36] will raise or what he said he is risen
[53:38] right now she's in the full resurrection
[53:42] of Jesus Christ will go all the way
[53:46] to the change of these bodies
[53:52] that's what I believe
[53:55] that's why I believe in healing
[53:57] so I believe in God Among Us see
[54:02] I just love to see it more you know what
[54:04] our problem is
[54:06] you know and the problem with God it's
[54:08] us
[54:11] my father said you go down the courts
[54:12] and do it if you just us you know well
[54:15] that's about true it's just us it's
[54:17] causing us a problem
[54:21] but see note about healing no
[54:23] resurrection and not just talking about
[54:25] we don't have the signs and wonders so
[54:28] keep repeating it
[54:31] during the time of the greatest healing
[54:33] campaigns the world has ever seen is a
[54:35] man talking about no Divine Healing no
[54:38] Resurrection amen
[54:40] Joy evidently must be pointing to that
[54:43] resurrection and tying it more into
[54:46] proving other than just healings
[54:50] but he's taking it to the glorified body
[54:54] all right now according to my
[54:56] understanding
[54:57] if I'm wrong correct me I never knew
[55:01] that people that were Sinners that were
[55:03] didn't have the new birth would get a
[55:05] glorified body
[55:07] and don't ask me what kind they did I
[55:09] don't know I ain't worried about it I
[55:11] know they don't have it connected to the
[55:12] new birth
[55:15] the our new birth is connected our
[55:17] Resurrection
[55:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost glorified
[55:22] body
[55:23] total eternity of the entire person that
[55:26] you're looking at amen
[55:29] because it were Christians
[55:33] we're Christians
[55:36] all right and believe in it to
[55:38] understand it
[55:40] I don't mind giving you even statements
[55:42] like this look at the next one but I
[55:44] tell you I'll give you all of it but
[55:45] then we try to put it all together see
[55:47] what it's talking about
[55:48] now let's talk about the death side
[55:51] now how could this is a demonology
[55:53] Physical Realm 53 608 paragraph 40.
[55:59] and how could a person on that estate in
[56:01] that kind of a condition ever be said
[56:06] now the Lord Jesus Christ was even sin
[56:09] right but look before he's making how
[56:13] could he even be sick because that your
[56:15] body is not yet redeemed amen now all
[56:20] right now you go to Future home and
[56:22] he'll tell you that that your soul is
[56:24] redeemed waiting the Redemption of your
[56:25] body
[56:26] but then he'll tell you
[56:29] in the message what
[56:31] he's already we're already renamed
[56:35] but he's just making a straight honest
[56:37] statement you know what our problem is
[56:39] the reason we're sick
[56:41] of course everybody's not Eternal and
[56:43] does that need a big boat to turn on
[56:48] our bodies are not eternal
[56:52] the Redemption that's done finished but
[56:55] it hasn't been applied to the Physical
[56:57] Realm of mankind
[57:00] so then the prophets say your body's not
[57:02] redeemed
[57:05] huh but he's not contrary to the Bible
[57:07] it will tell you already redeemed
[57:12] he's explaining this realm out here that
[57:14] we're in
[57:15] your body's not redeemed
[57:18] no matter how much or how good you are
[57:20] or a saintly or how holy how much Holy
[57:23] Spirit that's only your soul
[57:27] and your soul is not complete yet it's
[57:29] just got the Bless you that's right amen
[57:31] then he says no Divine Healing no
[57:33] Resurrection
[57:37] you're talking about the Redemption of
[57:39] the entire person
[57:42] proof of the Resurrection
[57:45] if God can come down and heal a body
[57:49] now we need disease well whatsoever
[57:51] any thought headache or any problems he
[57:54] could do that
[57:55] in his proof
[57:58] that he can raise it up
[58:02] well because he's already raised
[58:04] he went through Divine Healing didn't he
[58:07] as the world caused Divine Healing he
[58:09] went to eternal life he went to
[58:11] immortality in the flesh
[58:16] why because
[58:18] he paid the price
[58:20] all right but we're not trying to get
[58:22] into
[58:24] heal us there's a problem
[58:28] we're trying to figure out some way and
[58:30] it's good what do we do when we get sick
[58:32] we start repenting right which is good
[58:37] but the first thing you do is start
[58:38] repenting
[58:40] you start trying to clean up that's good
[58:45] but I don't heal you
[58:50] that's what he just said no matter how
[58:51] good you are what's going on
[58:54] I don't hear you
[58:58] I just like fasting
[59:00] fasting doesn't do anything but one
[59:02] thing
[59:03] you should be fast you do this fasting
[59:06] only gets you out of the way
[59:10] it don't bring God on the scene that's
[59:13] right
[59:14] it only gets you out of the way then he
[59:16] can come on the scene yes I know I got
[59:18] in trouble years ago quote I'm going to
[59:20] random right around and said I never
[59:21] fasted over three days of my life
[59:25] now you want that quote
[59:27] he said there's no such thing in the
[59:30] Bible of a 40-day fashion amen
[59:34] now we know the Lord Jesus did he said
[59:37] the reason he did cause he's God
[59:39] because we can't live 40 days without
[59:42] food I know some of them's trying to do
[59:44] it make pictures and they have a big fat
[59:46] belly and the next time you see them
[59:48] they're standing there you know in the
[59:49] pants and photo know what to do they
[59:50] suck their belly in and get about 10
[59:52] size too big and pull them around they
[59:54] don't buckle them up make it look like
[59:56] and you know that's no joke it's true
[1:00:02] because there ain't no such thing as a
[1:00:03] 40-day package fasting only gets you out
[1:00:06] of the way
[1:00:11] the prophet said if you're led to fast
[1:00:13] you'll not get hungry amen I can witness
[1:00:15] that that's right
[1:00:18] but then I've tried it on my own and got
[1:00:20] you hungry I've been glad to eat
[1:00:21] anything in the world
[1:00:25] right that's right but now listen
[1:00:30] see we're trying to conquer this body
[1:00:34] let me say this to you
[1:00:37] we think if we can conquer this body
[1:00:41] that some way
[1:00:44] we can bring about healings and
[1:00:46] different things
[1:00:48] and I just got to say it repentance is
[1:00:50] good
[1:00:52] see we don't have that
[1:00:55] that's wonderful
[1:00:57] don't stop doing that because I know one
[1:00:59] person told one time said the way y'all
[1:01:00] preach about us being God in flesh
[1:01:03] that then we don't have to repent
[1:01:05] because who do we repent to if we're God
[1:01:09] I said you didn't understand what's
[1:01:10] being taught
[1:01:14] we are children of God we're God in
[1:01:16] human flesh right but that don't do away
[1:01:18] with God and that don't do away with the
[1:01:20] fact that we do wrong because the Bible
[1:01:22] says and the prophet said only
[1:01:23] Christians have sins because everybody
[1:01:25] else is condemned on a higher level amen
[1:01:27] don't tell me brother Dale I'm a sinner
[1:01:30] no I'm not going to tell you God did
[1:01:34] huh
[1:01:38] no I got born again ain't no sin in me
[1:01:40] to run around and said that lady you
[1:01:42] know Jack Cole said that time
[1:01:46] I said about the lady that got a friend
[1:01:49] said you know I ain't told a line
[1:01:50] whatever so he said lady said she said I
[1:01:53] want to lay my tongue when I ordered he
[1:01:54] said ladies there's only 14 foot across
[1:01:56] here and it ain't long enough
[1:01:59] why because reacted he acting or lying
[1:02:03] about it
[1:02:05] Bible said if you say you have not
[1:02:07] sinned you are a liar
[1:02:11] but now if Christ in US can't see him so
[1:02:15] don't blame the one on the inside amen
[1:02:18] it's this body and spirit we're dealing
[1:02:20] with and that's our problem yeah that's
[1:02:22] what I'm talking about now we try to
[1:02:25] move something to put it into a place to
[1:02:26] justify the reasons of these things and
[1:02:29] there's no need to try to justify
[1:02:30] anything just face up and go right
[1:02:32] straight at it
[1:02:33] and look right at it and just just see
[1:02:36] all right
[1:02:37] look at the next one
[1:02:42] this is a message called Fellowship
[1:02:46] um
[1:02:48] 1955 813.
[1:02:50] e14 paragraph and Jesus came to restore
[1:02:53] the human race everything that he lost
[1:02:55] and eaten we were on our road okay good
[1:02:57] point now we have the earnest of that
[1:03:00] Deliverance
[1:03:03] now if we have the earnest
[1:03:05] wonderful
[1:03:10] that's good it'll come in time
[1:03:14] but give me the earnest
[1:03:17] you know you go down and you put down
[1:03:19] money on a car Ernest yeah right you put
[1:03:22] down money on a house
[1:03:24] you know you got so long
[1:03:26] and of course you don't make the
[1:03:27] payments after then they're gonna come
[1:03:29] and get it but you got so long that they
[1:03:32] can't touch that
[1:03:34] one because it's an earnest
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:38] and they got to give you a certain
[1:03:40] amount of time all right so if I just
[1:03:43] have the earnest of mine heard
[1:03:47] if I just have
[1:03:49] healing in my body that God has
[1:03:51] manifestation if I just have the new
[1:03:53] birth simply as
[1:03:57] just a vape in Christ
[1:04:01] I still got it
[1:04:04] you know brother Gary's talking about
[1:04:05] this the other day you know God revealed
[1:04:08] something to you Glory Hallelujah stand
[1:04:11] back but you try to figure out the rest
[1:04:13] of it it won't work
[1:04:16] we're supposed to take one step at a
[1:04:18] time but you only step when you see
[1:04:21] what's in front of you we're not trying
[1:04:23] to walk on water
[1:04:27] we're trying to walk on the word then if
[1:04:30] it takes it he can move out through the
[1:04:31] water I don't have to worry about
[1:04:32] sinking oh man
[1:04:35] well you understand what I'm saying if I
[1:04:37] just got an Earnest or something
[1:04:39] Gloria Hallelujah
[1:04:44] that's why I've always been the way of
[1:04:45] being church and I've always tried to
[1:04:47] preach you no take away the earnest from
[1:04:49] the people amen the church we were in
[1:04:52] the pastor started preaching it you
[1:04:54] didn't have the new birth
[1:04:56] like in in the book of Acts
[1:05:00] and I sat there and cried when he would
[1:05:02] tell people and they'd say but brother
[1:05:03] uh I I received a new birth no you just
[1:05:07] got an anointing I'll explain it to you
[1:05:09] one day so you were taking away
[1:05:10] everything in the world that those
[1:05:12] people had
[1:05:14] don't take away what somebody's got if
[1:05:16] it's just a word
[1:05:19] stand on that word
[1:05:21] keep moving
[1:05:23] don't worry about it well I don't worry
[1:05:26] about my time or not what do you mean
[1:05:27] who's winning the hell is not
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] if God reveals something to you don't
[1:05:33] worry about it come to pass
[1:05:37] but the problem is it's hard to wait
[1:05:38] sometime for that to come to pass right
[1:05:40] and
[1:05:42] we want to try to make it work on it
[1:05:44] look at the next what do we got I'm
[1:05:45] still on that one okay
[1:05:49] deliverance we have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:51] which is the life of God in a portion
[1:05:54] portion or a small part okay
[1:05:58] when we are in his presence at the end
[1:06:00] of life then we will have the full
[1:06:02] spirit
[1:06:03] this is called the earnest of our
[1:06:04] Salvation now we also believe that we'll
[1:06:07] have an immortal body someday
[1:06:10] when Jesus comes these vile bodies will
[1:06:12] be changed and we'll have a body like
[1:06:15] his own glorious body how many believe
[1:06:16] that thank you I'm happy to see that you
[1:06:18] believe that I look for that day myself
[1:06:20] notice if we have that
[1:06:23] and that was included in Redemption
[1:06:26] we've got to have Divine Healing for the
[1:06:29] earnest in order we've got the salvation
[1:06:31] of the Soul knowing we've got to have
[1:06:33] Divine Healing for the earnest of our
[1:06:35] complete deliverance
[1:06:37] huh
[1:06:38] if there's no Divine Healing there's no
[1:06:41] resurrection of the Dead
[1:06:42] how about that teach
[1:06:44] ER if there is no Divine Healing there's
[1:06:47] no Resurrection Divine Healing is the
[1:06:49] earnest of the Resurrection if the holy
[1:06:51] spirit is here and that is the earnest
[1:06:53] of our eternal life do you believe that
[1:06:55] if you have eternal life in your soul by
[1:06:58] the new birth that's the earnest
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:04] there's no way to lose that
[1:07:06] now we can lose healing but we can't
[1:07:09] lose salvation
[1:07:11] belated the vulnerabations of our
[1:07:13] confession
[1:07:14] we keep confessing the crucified let me
[1:07:17] get a few more
[1:07:20] we'll just try to cover this because I
[1:07:21] don't know we ain't gonna get to the
[1:07:22] last part I finished the season go ahead
[1:07:24] with the next
[1:07:26] this is paragraph 72 who is this
[1:07:29] MailChimp paper 72 73 74. well it's just
[1:07:32] melted at 65 to 21 evening
[1:07:35] and what is it
[1:07:36] the earnest of the Resurrection if
[1:07:39] you'll notice what I do a lot of times I
[1:07:41] I wish you would pay close attention
[1:07:42] that last quote was from 56. this quote
[1:07:45] is from 65. I like to do that
[1:07:49] because a lot of people say well he
[1:07:51] changed his mind later yeah amen
[1:07:55] he talked different later
[1:07:58] when I where's it at
[1:08:01] do they say now well he he talked a new
[1:08:03] bird back here but now he taught the new
[1:08:05] birth different in the later mention I'd
[1:08:07] like to see that called future home he
[1:08:09] said I taught three processes from a boy
[1:08:12] but see they don't want to hear that
[1:08:13] quote
[1:08:19] but listen what he's saying
[1:08:21] and what is it the earnest
[1:08:26] on the resurrection this body will be
[1:08:28] raised again because it's already
[1:08:30] started
[1:08:33] it was once subject to sin and mind
[1:08:35] ain't talking about your body
[1:08:38] this body will be raised again because
[1:08:40] it's already started
[1:08:42] man
[1:08:44] well I want to get in the resurrection I
[1:08:46] want this out of the other
[1:08:48] so really started again that's right
[1:08:52] I like that song He's still working on
[1:08:54] me yeah
[1:08:56] watch it but it's got to be Earnest I
[1:08:59] went a few it was 170 percent in my
[1:09:01] introduction but now it's got the
[1:09:02] earnest it's turned Evelyn now that's
[1:09:04] the earnest that you're going into
[1:09:06] rapture
[1:09:10] a sick person laying down nothing left
[1:09:13] but dead that's all can happen I've seen
[1:09:16] a shadow of people who've done eat up
[1:09:18] with cancer and tuberculosis and sitting
[1:09:20] them persons a little while after that
[1:09:23] perfectly normally strong if there's no
[1:09:25] Divine Healing then there's no
[1:09:27] Resurrection because Divine Healing is
[1:09:29] the earnest of the Resurrection
[1:09:32] see my point church is one thing
[1:09:36] to me all of the quotes coming from the
[1:09:38] prophet during the time of the greatest
[1:09:39] healing campaigns it's ever been of no
[1:09:42] Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:09:45] he's not condemning us because we're not
[1:09:47] having
[1:09:48] great humongous signs and wonders Among
[1:09:50] Us
[1:09:52] it's condemning us because we do not
[1:09:54] believe
[1:09:57] the reason we're not having signs and
[1:09:59] wonders among us like we would like to
[1:10:01] have is because we do not believe
[1:10:05] I am praying and have been now for about
[1:10:07] three months
[1:10:09] for a Revival
[1:10:13] among the people
[1:10:16] all right
[1:10:19] but now yours your the problem
[1:10:21] when I said Revival
[1:10:24] you're thinking about something much
[1:10:26] like the
[1:10:27] Pentecostal Revival on Azusa Street
[1:10:32] that's wonderful
[1:10:35] but that can happen in this day to
[1:10:38] non-believers
[1:10:40] of a Revival
[1:10:43] because they can mentally work herself
[1:10:45] into a position to believe me
[1:10:48] and the prophets did in the last days
[1:10:50] God would pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:10:52] Flesh
[1:10:54] the Bible says it the prophet said
[1:10:57] what kind of Revival brother Dale are
[1:10:58] you looking for revived Hearts amen
[1:11:02] right around and made a statement one
[1:11:04] time I remember years ago when I first
[1:11:05] heard it he said I had rather see love
[1:11:09] in a church
[1:11:10] listen
[1:11:12] then to see it was either five or ten
[1:11:15] thousand
[1:11:18] should saved
[1:11:25] well you got quiet
[1:11:28] so did I when he said amen
[1:11:31] what do you mean
[1:11:34] you'd rather see love among the people
[1:11:37] than to see ten thousand people saved
[1:11:42] see you don't know the rest of the
[1:11:43] quotes
[1:11:46] see the rest of the quote is if you get
[1:11:48] love among the people you're going to
[1:11:50] have a whole lot more than ten thousand
[1:11:52] people saying
[1:11:54] so I'm praying for a Revival of Love
[1:11:56] among the people not free love no
[1:12:00] Hallelujah
[1:12:07] a love of Brotherly kindness amen
[1:12:12] but this church right here needs more
[1:12:14] than anything in the world is a Revival
[1:12:16] of Brotherly kindness amen
[1:12:20] tell me you won't even hardly speak to
[1:12:21] the other person would you claim to go
[1:12:24] into the same heaven right yeah that's
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] suffering just left all right
[1:12:31] a Revival to come Among Us
[1:12:38] to put us so much in love with Jesus
[1:12:40] Christ until we be so much in love with
[1:12:42] each other until it won't be any problem
[1:12:49] brother Dale if you get straight down I
[1:12:51] love you more when that's all right
[1:12:54] just pray for me
[1:12:57] but is that going to make you love
[1:12:59] anybody
[1:13:00] I thought love was conditioned upon
[1:13:02] yourself
[1:13:04] right
[1:13:05] I didn't know love was if you love me I
[1:13:08] love you
[1:13:10] I didn't think that worked that way I
[1:13:13] thought it worked I love you whether you
[1:13:15] love me or not
[1:13:20] I love my wife whether she ever loves me
[1:13:22] if not that's that's her part of the end
[1:13:24] of the deal that's not mine
[1:13:30] and we don't we don't want to get into
[1:13:32] talking like that do we
[1:13:34] but we're going in a rapture
[1:13:39] okay we can also go to the nation
[1:13:43] I get free should I'm doing the wrong
[1:13:44] thing I know it's not hurt feelings
[1:13:46] sorry about it
[1:13:48] this is
[1:13:50] e47 taken from Abraham Bridge 66 1208.
[1:13:54] see I'm going backwards and four active
[1:13:55] before
[1:13:56] every person would ever healed every
[1:13:58] person would ever say would say when
[1:13:59] Jesus died at the cross and finished and
[1:14:02] every person ever healed every person
[1:14:03] ever saved was saved when Jesus died at
[1:14:06] the cross and finished the work he
[1:14:07] screamed to the father is finished all
[1:14:09] of it the complete Plan of Salvation and
[1:14:11] now we have the earnest of our Salvation
[1:14:13] now Divine Healing is not on the same
[1:14:15] basis of Salvation now we know that's
[1:14:18] true right
[1:14:19] well you can be sick today you'll be
[1:14:21] healed and be sick it's not
[1:14:24] eternal
[1:14:26] with salvation for the shoulders eternal
[1:14:29] healing is not on the same basis as
[1:14:31] salvation now why he's not saying it's
[1:14:33] not on the same base you've got two
[1:14:34] different bases
[1:14:36] now you understand he's not saying two
[1:14:38] different bases this is based on this
[1:14:39] and it's based on that
[1:14:41] no it's all based on faith
[1:14:44] but it's simply the fact that you can be
[1:14:46] sick and healed and sick and healed but
[1:14:48] you can't do that in Salvation you're
[1:14:50] not saved and lost saved and lost saved
[1:14:52] and all right at least we ought to be
[1:14:54] far enough to know that
[1:14:56] it's not on the same basis
[1:14:58] Divine Healing was included in the
[1:15:00] atonement truly the old atonement had
[1:15:03] Divine Healing and the new one is much
[1:15:05] better than the old one so if it's
[1:15:07] better it's got to be better in every
[1:15:09] way but Divine Healing salvation is of
[1:15:12] the soul and you become a new creature
[1:15:15] eternal life
[1:15:16] you don't have eternal Health by healing
[1:15:20] amen all right nurses basis right but
[1:15:22] it's an attribute it's the earnest of
[1:15:25] your Resurrection if there's no Divine
[1:15:27] Healing then there's no Resurrection see
[1:15:29] but now what is it it's your own
[1:15:31] personal faith in a finished work of
[1:15:33] Christ now let me just turn over to the
[1:15:36] back here and just preach a little bit
[1:15:39] and we'll leave these it says in Malachi
[1:15:42] 4.
[1:15:44] that the son of righteousness would rise
[1:15:46] in healing with healing in his wings
[1:15:48] all right
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:52] as I was keep stating that during the
[1:15:55] time of the greatest Revival of healings
[1:15:57] and things and they they credit brother
[1:15:59] Brown and Oral Roberts as being the two
[1:16:01] of the beginning of the Divine Healing
[1:16:04] campaigns in other words Etc to sweep it
[1:16:07] out now FF Bosworth and then was way on
[1:16:09] back Seymour and then was our in the
[1:16:10] healings and signs and wonders took
[1:16:12] place right but to bring it out like
[1:16:14] they did even the world the religious
[1:16:17] world even credits would have ran them
[1:16:18] into the beginning of it now
[1:16:21] and in that town he would say no Divine
[1:16:23] Healing no resurrection of the greatest
[1:16:26] signs and wonders could take place
[1:16:28] now I've tried to preach this to you
[1:16:30] back then a long time ago to get you to
[1:16:32] see because it says in Malachi 4 that
[1:16:35] the son of righteousness would rise with
[1:16:37] healings in his land
[1:16:38] so it was a healing campaign that
[1:16:40] started back there
[1:16:43] all right but we've read over and over
[1:16:44] to proof of what we're talking about no
[1:16:46] Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:16:48] all right
[1:16:49] the Resurrection The the new birth
[1:16:51] covers it for the soul the resurrection
[1:16:53] of the body is an example of healing of
[1:16:56] the body then he can change the body
[1:16:58] right all right now he then the son of
[1:17:01] righteousness would rise see he not only
[1:17:03] left us because healing has been here uh
[1:17:06] it's reason I got to that point I'll
[1:17:07] just cut it off with the rest of the
[1:17:08] nation
[1:17:09] and do it this way we covered that that
[1:17:13] healing was under the Old Testament
[1:17:14] atonement
[1:17:16] all right we just read it and he lives
[1:17:18] in the New Testament atonement he said
[1:17:19] even greater why because you've got the
[1:17:21] inside believed right right where's the
[1:17:24] person the Old Testament don't have an
[1:17:26] outside
[1:17:26] right they were believing in their
[1:17:28] spiritual realm and their their body but
[1:17:30] not in their soul because her Soul's
[1:17:31] lost but in the New Testament your soul
[1:17:34] is pure and clean so then you can
[1:17:36] believe and accept God and believe it
[1:17:38] all right but the son of righteousness
[1:17:39] would rise with healings in his wind so
[1:17:42] he not only left us with that statement
[1:17:44] gee if you understand what I believe a
[1:17:46] prophet would do it not Divine Healing
[1:17:48] no Resurrection
[1:17:50] all right
[1:17:52] you see Paul could have said don't
[1:17:54] Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:17:56] Irene is Martin Colombo Luther Wesley
[1:17:59] right
[1:18:01] Azusa Street Pentecost no Divine Healing
[1:18:04] no Resurrection they could have said
[1:18:06] that because that's true because this is
[1:18:07] that's what I'm trying to get you to
[1:18:09] look at
[1:18:10] but then here in the end time God would
[1:18:12] send a Divine Healing campaign
[1:18:15] that would sweep out and cover the world
[1:18:19] what
[1:18:20] proof that the resurrection was coming
[1:18:27] right that's right proof that they would
[1:18:29] be a physical Resurrection coming
[1:18:34] all of the times the prophet would stand
[1:18:36] there in those healings and was proof
[1:18:38] that a resurrection was coming in other
[1:18:40] words it was speaking of it
[1:18:42] do you see a Divine Healing campaign
[1:18:44] sweep the world
[1:18:48] I'm going out there in the son of
[1:18:49] righteousness rise with healing in his
[1:18:51] wings
[1:18:53] until the world had to confess
[1:18:57] but see God was doing that because he
[1:18:59] was fixing the brain a prophet on the
[1:19:02] scene right that's right amen
[1:19:04] do we just didn't bring the prophet on
[1:19:06] the scene
[1:19:08] and let him start his message
[1:19:12] come on what'd he do he brought a
[1:19:15] healing campaign
[1:19:17] to cover the world
[1:19:19] to show that God is real
[1:19:22] and that healing campaign slip out
[1:19:25] then out of there
[1:19:29] a man started with his message and you
[1:19:32] read the message of the Rapture in a
[1:19:33] different place and I'll be glad to show
[1:19:35] them to you but run around and said his
[1:19:36] message begun in the seals another
[1:19:38] Reformation didn't begin in the 40s that
[1:19:41] was a restoration back to the Bible
[1:19:43] that was what they were saying that was
[1:19:45] what they were teaching
[1:19:47] he come into the third in 63 he came
[1:19:49] into his message he said not the years
[1:19:52] of preparation go read it
[1:19:55] he brought his message begun with no
[1:19:57] seals open
[1:19:59] all right and went forward because that
[1:20:00] was a message to the end time but now
[1:20:02] listen to what I'm saying and this is
[1:20:04] the point
[1:20:06] if there had to be a Divine Healing
[1:20:08] forerun the mission now we know what the
[1:20:11] prophet said right healing was what
[1:20:14] Bay on the hook
[1:20:16] to get the attention of the people where
[1:20:19] they would hear the message
[1:20:21] all right
[1:20:22] now all down through there he was
[1:20:24] preaching
[1:20:25] but he was preaching the same Peter and
[1:20:27] Paul and James and John and all them
[1:20:29] preached right
[1:20:32] bringing it back to talk about the faith
[1:20:34] of the father
[1:20:38] but then the message would come
[1:20:40] now if if gun healing is proof in the
[1:20:44] resurrection
[1:20:49] now you're listening
[1:20:51] then the message the prophet brought
[1:20:53] would be that Resurrection into the
[1:20:57] higher form
[1:20:59] Amen to be able to take us to the change
[1:21:01] of these bodies
[1:21:04] because it was none of them taught the
[1:21:06] statue of a perfect man Even though
[1:21:07] Peter and him preached it
[1:21:09] but they couldn't attain unto the
[1:21:10] position to bring a chain to the body
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:13] a sensual it didn't happen
[1:21:16] well you shouldn't say they couldn't
[1:21:18] make I'm not saying they couldn't I said
[1:21:20] they didn't
[1:21:22] they didn't they couldn't
[1:21:24] all right argue with that
[1:21:27] but listen
[1:21:29] then that Divine Healing campaign only
[1:21:32] spoke of that brother that God was going
[1:21:34] to send a message
[1:21:36] that would not be
[1:21:38] used to message his people thinks about
[1:21:40] but would be the very message of the
[1:21:43] Resurrection
[1:21:46] that's why that Prophet would stand
[1:21:47] there
[1:21:50] and he said the son of man was back
[1:21:52] there
[1:21:53] man
[1:21:55] who said
[1:21:57] he could tell the people their thoughts
[1:22:00] he said and let me stand here
[1:22:03] and God used me to tell you your
[1:22:05] thoughts what
[1:22:09] Joy even in his early Ministry that the
[1:22:11] son of man was already coming into view
[1:22:14] but then one day the son of man came to
[1:22:16] bring his message not right around him
[1:22:18] the Lord Jesus Christ came down United
[1:22:20] with the prophet of God in 63 and
[1:22:23] started bringing the message right amen
[1:22:25] sure he was using the man he had to
[1:22:28] but that not only showed listen no
[1:22:30] Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:22:33] that could be said all the way down
[1:22:34] through time
[1:22:38] what's in here we're going to profit
[1:22:42] and what was he saying
[1:22:46] can I translate something to you where
[1:22:48] it won't offend you
[1:22:50] when he was saying no Divine Healing no
[1:22:52] Resurrection
[1:22:53] after
[1:22:54] the opening of the seals what was he
[1:22:56] saying
[1:22:58] please
[1:23:00] no
[1:23:04] he was saying if you don't get the
[1:23:06] message
[1:23:10] and can't stand on Divine Healing
[1:23:13] what are you going to do when uh
[1:23:16] a bunch of Bible say
[1:23:18] if you can't keep up with the footman
[1:23:21] he said then there's no way to worry
[1:23:23] about keeping up with the horsemen right
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:28] you're saying the message I've just
[1:23:30] brought to you is the resurrection
[1:23:35] and if we have the Holy Spirit within us
[1:23:38] and that is the resurrection with inside
[1:23:39] of us and if we have the Holy Spirit
[1:23:42] we'll agree with the message
[1:23:47] there's the proof of whether you're born
[1:23:48] again or not it's whether or not you can
[1:23:50] agree with the nation now not just agree
[1:23:52] with sometimes
[1:23:53] like I told you the other day when I was
[1:23:55] preaching marriage and divorce yeah
[1:23:56] people are oh I won't marriage and
[1:23:58] divorce I won't be set free for my my uh
[1:24:00] things that I've wronged where I had too
[1:24:02] many wives or too many husbands or
[1:24:03] whatever you know I'm glad I set free Oh
[1:24:05] Glory to God he was a prophet then you
[1:24:07] said well what about this well I don't
[1:24:08] believe he's right down
[1:24:11] we don't want you just lost your
[1:24:12] marriage
[1:24:14] you just lost your grace
[1:24:17] you made a disgrace you just lost it
[1:24:21] you say all you want in the rest of your
[1:24:23] life I'm free if you don't believe the
[1:24:24] prophet he said this is to my followers
[1:24:26] only now followers mean followers right
[1:24:30] they don't mean leaders and going the
[1:24:32] opposite direction right right
[1:24:35] man but everybody's trying to straighten
[1:24:37] out the man that brought the grace of
[1:24:39] marriage and divorce amen I'm saying
[1:24:41] he's wrong here what year did I already
[1:24:43] been this
[1:24:45] you see this message
[1:24:49] it's proof of a glorified body amen
[1:24:53] they've never been anybody in the Bible
[1:24:55] come on listen to me I know what Paul
[1:24:57] and him taught I know what Peter them
[1:24:58] taught and they talked to daily walks in
[1:25:00] Salvation Etc yeah right but none of
[1:25:03] them would ever concerned with the
[1:25:04] Redemption of the body right because it
[1:25:06] was not the day that's right that's
[1:25:08] right this is the day for the body to be
[1:25:11] redeemed Hallelujah
[1:25:17] I'm talking about physical amen
[1:25:21] not talking about change of the body
[1:25:23] without this message there would be no
[1:25:26] change
[1:25:27] I'm talking about this prophet's message
[1:25:29] that started in 63. that would bring the
[1:25:32] chains in the body
[1:25:35] but there was a Divine Healing campaign
[1:25:38] struck back there
[1:25:40] and went for it to prove that there was
[1:25:43] something coming
[1:25:44] the Shelton coming was the message
[1:25:48] right
[1:25:50] not the message
[1:25:53] about something but the message optional
[1:25:57] the message of eternal life
[1:26:02] come on
[1:26:03] to quit
[1:26:05] I've even invited you to do this
[1:26:07] get one of those books where you can
[1:26:09] look at the titles of the sermons
[1:26:12] you know what I'm talking about yeah the
[1:26:13] index books just get one one day and
[1:26:16] just sit down and turn over the Earth to
[1:26:19] 63.
[1:26:23] and start reading the titles
[1:26:26] of the sermons
[1:26:29] just the tiles
[1:26:33] read the titles of the sermon
[1:26:40] you had all of those back there you know
[1:26:42] about Jezebel religion
[1:26:44] all kind of things you know
[1:26:48] but when you get after the seals
[1:26:51] he preached in 57 that Melchizedek was
[1:26:54] almighty God back and read it
[1:26:58] but when he preached it again he
[1:27:00] preached who is this
[1:27:05] he always preached that Jesus was one
[1:27:07] true and living God but he preached
[1:27:10] Christ in this community of God
[1:27:12] just read the titles
[1:27:15] future home
[1:27:16] of the Heavenly bridegroom Earthly bride
[1:27:19] yes
[1:27:21] things that are to be
[1:27:24] Mighty God unveiled
[1:27:26] invisible Union
[1:27:30] this day the scriptures fulfilled amen
[1:27:33] just read the titles of the sermon
[1:27:37] you can see the message went into
[1:27:39] eternal life amen while we're living
[1:27:44] no that we can't have a resurrection of
[1:27:46] Divine Healing while we're living then
[1:27:48] there is no resurrection of the body
[1:27:49] right if we can't have salvation to
[1:27:52] deliver us now by the soul of eternal
[1:27:55] life then there is no eternal life to
[1:27:57] come
[1:27:57] and
[1:27:59] but if we can get it all together it'll
[1:28:01] come to the right place
[1:28:02] no Divine Healing
[1:28:05] no Resurrection
[1:28:08] no salvation
[1:28:10] no eternal life to come
[1:28:14] we just die and go by the grave
[1:28:18] oh no no we don't believe that I agree
[1:28:21] with you we don't believe that believe
[1:28:22] that but that's what we're talking about
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:25] as I said there a moment ago the
[1:28:27] Baptists Don't Preach well we don't want
[1:28:30] healing or nothing now because we don't
[1:28:32] want to do this they just preaching
[1:28:34] stuff for them
[1:28:35] yeah
[1:28:36] if God wants you ever heard him
[1:28:38] I've been married
[1:28:40] if God wants to heal now he can do what
[1:28:42] he wants to
[1:28:43] because he's God
[1:28:46] but we just don't believe it that's
[1:28:47] right and we just don't teach it that
[1:28:49] way why were there so much against
[1:28:50] brother Branham when he was going
[1:28:51] forward with a healing campaign if they
[1:28:54] believed in healing
[1:28:58] why was there so much against daddy
[1:28:59] Seymour and them into the juicer Street
[1:29:02] when they were going forth with a great
[1:29:03] Revival and he even said to Chef I was
[1:29:05] reading it yesterday out of some things
[1:29:07] of Wade has on the rooster Street and he
[1:29:09] said himself he said this is not basis
[1:29:11] on healing excuse me he said it's not
[1:29:13] just based on speaking in tongues
[1:29:17] he said it's not gestational speaking in
[1:29:19] tongues
[1:29:20] he said this is based upon God living
[1:29:22] among us
[1:29:26] a sister Street was God living among us

[1:29:30] wear a suitcase street but around said
[1:29:32] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost judge
