[1:08] tiny school but that's crap spies or
[1:12] Jesus we thank you God for allowing us
[1:14] to come together to hear more about you
[1:15] or pretty too up and out of our heart
[1:17] and understanding or grin upgraded to
[1:20] remember all those it couldn't be here
[1:21] today and they're sick and afflicted
[1:23] remember wait is it created better going
[1:26] this morning granted voted she'll be
[1:28] with us this morning where the services
[1:29] it with your name yes I'm brother Joe
[1:35] itself you'll have to deal let's turn it
[1:40] on to first Peter five and love 88 and
[1:45] then to 10 worst
[1:57] 510 a 2d said beast over there don't eat
[2:07] because your adversary the devil and
[2:09] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[2:12] he may evolve more resistant to step
[2:16] path and baton on that the same
[2:18] afflictions are accomplished and your
[2:20] brother and there are in the world but
[2:23] the god of all grace who has called us
[2:25] on to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ
[2:28] after they do have supper law make you
[2:30] perfect establish strength and settle
[2:34] you now let's go to Ephesians chapter 6
[2:39] verse 10 to 17
[2:49] said finally my brother them be strong
[2:52] in the Lord in the power of his might
[2:54] put on a whole armor of God that you may
[2:57] be able to stand against their world the
[3:01] devil when we wrestle not against flesh
[3:04] and blood but against principalities
[3:06] against powers against the rulers of the
[3:09] darkness of the world this world against
[3:12] spiritual wickedness in high places
[3:14] wherefore take on to yourself the whole
[3:17] armor of God that you may be able to
[3:19] stand in the evil day having done all to
[3:22] stand stand therefore having a longer to
[3:27] heaven on their breasts place roaches
[3:30] net and your feet shod with the
[3:32] preparation of the gospel of peace above
[3:35] all things that Sheila fate where you
[3:38] shall be able to quench over very dark
[3:42] period darts of the wicked and take the
[3:45] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[3:47] Spirit which is the word of God I was
[3:50] wondering read another scripture we got
[3:52] so much stuff to cover so I'm going to
[3:55] skip that LeBron said a devil is almost
[4:01] all most harmless I let's even have
[4:04] somebody to work in and that's the way
[4:06] God does too he has to have us he's
[4:09] dependent on us to work through
[4:19] he said now do you know we have wars up
[4:22] two wars and rumors of wars and the
[4:24] Earth's tank will have plenty more Wars
[4:26] but do you realize there's only two
[4:28] powers in all the universe all of the
[4:32] other difference between nations and
[4:33] differences between each other and
[4:35] everything at all mounts up to two
[4:38] powers there's only two power there's
[4:40] only two kingdoms to pursue and to
[4:43] Kingdom all the rest the little minor
[4:45] things are connected either one of those
[4:48] powers and those parties Gus power and
[4:51] Satan power that's what every war every
[4:54] disorder everything that comes along as
[4:56] either controlled by God's power or
[4:58] Satan's power so that's how it to power
[5:00] their dearest and that is the power
[5:03] about life and the power of death that's
[5:07] not a two-parter so we had to choose
[5:09] between life and death now we should
[5:12] already which site want to be and Satan
[5:16] can only his part only pervert it you
[5:20] know he's only got the power that God
[5:22] gives in to like it did with Joel you
[5:24] can do what you want but you can't touch
[5:26] his life
[5:34] so I normally at first and getting ready
[5:36] for a battle first upset got to be a
[5:38] select asst some soldiers they got to be
[5:42] dressed for fighting they got to be
[5:43] trained for fighting can you imagine
[5:45] going on the war and you don't have no
[5:47] life on or nothing you've done so we had
[5:50] to be equipped if we want to fight the
[5:52] road and I believe that the greatest
[5:55] battle that our squad is now ready to go
[5:59] on that song I believe that God has been
[6:01] said select any soldiers I believe he's
[6:04] being dressing them training them and
[6:06] the battle super Mel C getting ready to
[6:09] start this first grade metal it was her
[6:13] fault beginning heaven when Michael and
[6:15] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[6:17] his angel it first started the first bed
[6:20] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[6:24] on earth it originated in heaven and
[6:27] then it was thrown down from heaven
[6:30] Tesla I heaven to the earth I fell on
[6:33] human being then the bell from angel
[6:35] became human battles and same come to
[6:39] destroy God's creation what God had
[6:42] created to be for himself he has same
[6:45] come to destroy that that's what is /
[6:47] was to destroy it from then the battle
[6:50] began here on earth and again in us and
[6:52] we have been raging ever since now
[6:55] before a battle can be put in the rate
[6:57] of first they have to choose a meeting
[6:59] ground or place where the battle is to
[7:01] be fought
[7:06] he said when this great battle started
[7:08] on earth they had to be a mutual place
[7:09] there the big place select for the
[7:12] battle to begin and for the Bibble read
[7:14] and that battle ground began than their
[7:16] mind they're actually the battle store
[7:19] the human mind was chosen for the place
[7:22] of the bell so decisions are made in the
[7:25] mind there's were say meet you and
[7:27] decisions or because they've got made a
[7:30] man that way but what is that choose
[7:34] isn't it the horror of the soul
[7:53] he said that he got census see text
[7:57] field spell here they're all right but
[7:59] don't trust them unless they agree with
[8:01] the world they all right but if this
[8:02] they disagree really worked on listening
[8:05] to them imaginations conscious memory
[8:08] reasonable effects of it all right if
[8:09] they agree with a world but your
[8:12] affection doesn't agree with the work
[8:13] get rid of it you said that's your
[8:18] battleground you're better learning it
[8:19] back here and that one in the beginning
[8:21] back here in the soul back in your mind
[8:23] it opened up the mind is the gate to the
[8:25] soul you said the gate of spirit whether
[8:29] you might open i set the spirit or to
[8:31] reject the spirit you can have little
[8:33] consciously little feelings a little
[8:35] sensation all this thing that has
[8:38] nothing to do it that's just little
[8:41] sensations and things but when it comes
[8:43] to reality your mind opens it up you
[8:47] either accept it or reject it see it's
[8:51] your mind has opened up the door opposed
[8:53] to the door and listened to your
[8:54] consciousness listen to your memory
[8:56] listen to your affection but when your
[8:58] mind calls itself to these things and
[9:00] make up the spirit of this world come in
[9:03] it blows the rest of the stuff up every
[9:06] dollar is going every fear is going
[9:07] everything station of doubt it's gone
[9:09] every feeling is gone there's not him
[9:11] there but the war of God and Satan
[9:14] cannot battle against it well sure you
[9:17] cannot battle against it now you hear me
[9:22] ok oh that's a problem in four starts
[9:28] but give God that might give God work
[9:32] the first place a man can't even come to
[9:34] god he can't sin here it is American on
[9:39] sin until first he kisses outside God's
[9:42] Word he can't even sing that's disbelief
[9:45] until a person gets railed I work work
[9:48] the presence of God he cannot sin
[9:57] there there's a bell at first the very
[10:01] first try mine but that's not you
[10:04] prevention Tony use a 22 rifle is that
[10:07] let's use an atomic bomb and what is the
[10:10] atomic bomb if they had th and his word
[10:14] faith in his work
[10:27] he said God is training for this great
[10:30] battle Matthew said there and also Dale
[10:33] said there will be a time of trouble
[10:34] such as never liked enough before and
[10:38] we're living in a time when culture
[10:40] education thing this mother of the world
[10:42] the Word of God and got it into recent
[10:45] and so for the battles now who will
[10:47] stand a fellow radical and she's the
[10:50] right now look what a great opposition
[10:52] we got younger who would be like there
[10:56] is that you stand let the uncircumcised
[10:58] police think that part of them the
[11:01] father armies of Living God holla go
[11:03] fight him and man hello once men and
[11:06] women this morning blue can raise up and
[11:08] say I'll take the Lord at his word so
[11:12] David you were or still you know he was
[11:15] anointed to be king no matter whatever
[11:16] the giant wasn't
[11:24] he says that the brains of the army lays
[11:27] in the captain thing Teletoon is that
[11:29] roma Roma in Germany was the brains of
[11:32] Germany not Hitler I say horror military
[11:35] man hadn't those men were at the front
[11:38] it depend on which way they get over you
[11:41] follow your captain if he survived kind
[11:43] of a general it is a right if he's
[11:45] a force or Jam his pocket he's been
[11:48] proven to be right for him though he may
[11:51] seem wrong to you to go on to the front
[11:54] do as he is told he said we got a five
[11:59] star general would run first door down
[12:04] spell j esus Jesus yes place him faster
[12:10] than us fe idea was to fade he's never
[12:14] lost a battle City conquer dead hell on
[12:19] the grid if the tables out of the way is
[12:21] the great ship captain so the devil
[12:23] isn't isn't even in the picture these
[12:31] are America addresses are soldiers in
[12:33] the best they can have to dress with
[12:36] steel helmets and armors or whatever
[12:38] they got armor thanks for every God God
[12:40] dress his army what kind of equipment we
[12:44] use the spirit of the sword the Word of
[12:46] God amen the Word of God is sharpening
[12:49] that to a sword people's for Pierce and
[12:52] hit into a thunder boom given the narrow
[12:55] of the bone even at the sir that top of
[12:57] the mind the Word of God to believe his
[13:00] work and that's the way God armor
[13:20] he said here we see the Texas tactics of
[13:24] the devil how do we do now I got a lot
[13:26] of scripture here a profit of pants
[13:28] where we come to them and different
[13:30] people through the Bible and done the
[13:32] same thing it's always a step that is to
[13:35] try to get the people to disbelieve the
[13:37] world we're listen your soldiers of the
[13:42] cross when you just believe one word of
[13:44] God cuz written Bible your disarm
[14:00] it says same army bring this easy that's
[14:03] what say that he's a destroyer saying
[14:06] the whole team not Satanists sickness
[14:08] dead and sorrow frustrations and were
[14:12] worried all on Satan god is love faith
[14:16] joy peace and so on
[14:30] brother Brown said devil don't have to
[14:34] fire a shot he's got us shooting at each
[14:38] other to say he's got one punch coming
[14:42] at you whatever your weakness it its
[14:45] cover that spot it's going to hurt it a
[14:49] bit yeah be careful the way we talk to
[14:54] each other because God is Dennis people
[14:59] so I thought I talking bad about
[15:01] football for fellas or anybody you
[15:03] talking bad luck on what I'm saying
[15:05] something so John 15 12 this is karma
[15:12] Matt this is my commandment that you
[15:14] love one another as I have loved you
[15:17] let's go to John 13
[15:36] 34 35
[15:44] a new commandment I give unto you that
[15:46] you love one another as I have loved you
[15:48] did you also love one another by this
[15:53] shall all men know that you are my
[15:55] disciples and if you have loved one that
[15:58] you have love one to another
[16:06] e
[16:11] now we're here they're not to serve
[16:14] ourself here to serve each other we do
[16:17] that you're staring heaven and the face
[16:21] it said that when you're in the army of
[16:25] the soldier gets wounded you don't you
[16:28] don't need nobody behind you don't leave
[16:29] no man behind so when a brother or
[16:32] sister gets hurt or somebody hurt so we
[16:34] help them to come up we're all one body
[16:40] of Christ so when somebody gets hurt
[16:45] somebody tells them something something
[16:47] we help them pick them up and even look
[16:50] in the other one if you have to you of
[16:52] you have to carry them no no no man is
[16:57] left behind like Moses said we're going
[17:01] with all with our young horses and cows
[17:03] or where were you all right nobody left
[17:08] mine
[17:11] now the devil already has that people in
[17:14] the world I mean they already killing
[17:18] each other Levin said that pressure is
[17:21] going to be like that well well well
[17:22] still carry a gun to protect yourself I
[17:25] think in my nose California wasn't they
[17:31] already called like Gunsmoke what is it
[17:34] what's the name is a tombstone yeah like
[17:39] you know it was a shooting at each other
[17:41] across you know actually this week a 14

[18:18] you but brother Richard you know what a
[18:19] nice timing but that's to go to parades

[18:25] doing your training and when you're not
[18:27] in the battle of something you were
[18:30] called for taste so I don't think we

[18:34] battle every day so we need to wear for
[18:36] taste another he dressed be dressed for
