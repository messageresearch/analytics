========================================

so we learned that my brother was homeless and he didn't tell anyone and so the only person he could call was pastor tony down in six flags and well he contacted us and the first thing we could think of is try finding a place so we all thought okay let's find him these extended stays down there and we did he stayed a week there he found a job and then we were like okay we don't want to pay another 330 a week let's see if we can find an apartment for him or a roommate for him so i went down there and i told him okay i'll go talk to a few of the sisters and brothers at brother tony's just to find out who knows of an apartment somewhere or you know where to start looking and i went i got some numbers and but pastor tony told me before you go let me take you to an african store down there in austral and they list on the window there on the outside you know somebody looking for a roommate and they have a list of numbers there and like we called all of them and they were all taken and then while we were in the car i told my brother well let's go and he said too let's go back in there and tell the shopkeeper that you know if somebody's looking for a roommate just call me and i left my number and then there was somebody behind us who wanted to pay whatev for whatever groceries he had and then he had the conversation and he said oh uh brother you're paying 3 30 that's a lot in a week uh i got a living room you can come live with me but i also know of a friend of mine who told me yesterday he's looking for a roommate i said okay can you give us his number and he did and he said well let me call him first so he did and we contacted him and he was willing to take my brother and we drove and he found a roommate now and he found a place to stay so it was a coin i told him it was not a coincidence that he walked in at that time we were having that conversation and he had the whole conversation and decided to help and um so he's somewhere and he's settled in he's working and we found him akai and all that and that's why the last two sundays i kinda had to be down there and you know settle me in yeah but i thought that was just not a coincidence that that happened like that

these cloth things on it's just rough to sing especially as you get a little bit older young people won't have to worry about it but older people have to worry about stuff like that so remember wednesday brother dale's already announced he's preaching on wednesday night so that's a good middle of the week jump we can have a man also remember too by way of a few announcements next sunday a brother jewel called and i'll be preaching for him next sunday so you'll either do two or whatever he decides he'll tell you wednesday night okay but i'll be a brother joel fournies on sunday the 7th on also on the 14th i'll be at brother richard hyatt speaking for him and also on the 21st brother trevor emonds from um jeffersonville i guess he goes by the nathan bryant's church he's the brother that members of the uh little booklet the sp the seven church age book the little booklet the little study booklet that we got all of us got one our brother trevor is the one that put that together so he'll be here with us lord willing on march the 21st all right and be speaking for us both services so everybody got that we'll be announcing it again also on june the 17th 18th 19th i'm going to keep saying it we're going to have our father's day fishing trip annual trip and the sisters are going to have their annual sister's day fishing trip they going to find some water somewhere so they might not be fishing but uh keep all that in your mind write it down on your calendar so you don't come up one day and go i forgot so get you a big old calendar me and jim got them all over the house now we have all calendars for this and calendars for that and we got a big one in there in the in the uh in the study so we're still creatures of time so let me have us gotta get up and go to work tomorrow then we're still creatures of time well we might not be creatures of time but we need to work make some money but for right now let's just settle down and listen to what the lord has for us so we're still in on eternal redemption today we're going to go into the um try to get through five of the dimensions um boy i got to studying a little bit on the fourth dimension on the radio waves and it just kind of curled my toes and i just said no we're going to stay simple we just we're just going to stay simple but i'll bring out some things that's really interesting because the fourth dimension is the dimension that we can't contact we cannot contact the fourth dimension we have to have a piece of equipment that catches i mean it's here it's right here right now proving it by one thing i'm speaking it's going into this right here by airwaves it's going back there and it's coming back through these speakers so there you go you know and but you can't see them you can hear my voice sure you got receptors to hear it but you had to have something to hear with because if i muffled this and cut it off those in the back couldn't understand so we had to have something extra to help us to contact that fourth dimension and we'll talk about that just a little bit but we're not going to try to bore you i just want us to know why we in this plan of redemption yesterday my whole thought was as brother dale's whole thought was was before the world what what was i mean this plan has been laid out god's got he knew he's going to need a fifth dimension he knew he was going to need a sixth dimension he knew that we were gonna if we didn't have a fourth dimension we'd have never got the prophet's message never would have picked it up if we hadn't had that fourth dimension where he stands up there in 1947 and he says we've got this new device i think maybe you said or something gadget we got this new gadget in 1947 and really the first ones were on a wire and then the next one were on the lp like a record player and then the next one were the uh the uh eight um eight inch reels which are magnetic it was a magnetic voice it was a magnetic reel that picked up the voice and then it sent it back to me and you so the voice of god in this age was used the fourth dimension more than anybody ever used it amen so god had that dimension there and you know what there's another guy that uses it too the devil uses it also he puts all of his other junk through the fourth dimension uh your your uh internet and everything else is in the fourth dimension all right so we'll talk about that just for a little bit but i want to um get on the chart just a little bit because god knew what was going to happen the plan was the way god saw it so he had to have a fifth dimension he had to have a sixth dimension he had to have a paradise we're going to talk about that a little bit today he had to have a paradise a place to wait before you could go into another dimension now see you see where the catholic church is brother john the catholic church sees satan is so close the catholic church says you got to go through purgatory before you can get into heaven and purgatory is kind of that place between heaven and hell well we're going to see that brother brown can totally tells us that the fifth dimension is hell but it's not a burning hell it's a place of holding the catholic church is just saying while you're down there getting held we can pray you out for a little extra cash for a little extra atm work we can get you out of we can get you out of hell but no you'll hear what the prophet said he said once you leave this earth your decision was made here and you can't change it when you get there like brother dale's talking on predestination see that part that is predestinated so let's bow our heads i think we got all the announcements out of the way damn the father we thank you for this day we thank you for the word that you give us already we pray that you'd give us more father just pile it on to us today lord but give us understanding that we can understand it ears to hear eyes to see and lord just be with each one lord that six is to christine and all the different ones ones that are outside lord by the kern he's coming out and bless his heart lord he's been to the church service and we thank you for that and we know one thing's for sure that that effort has not been overlooked you knew it before the foundation of the world that we would want to come to church more than our sickness but lord we have to do certain things lord to keep it away we pray that you'll just be with each one of us bless us take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit lord you be the active participant in this service you take over and do the work father we pray for the bride around the world that you'll take care of each one lord and raise us up lord so that we can get out of this place or not be babies lord we'll be full-grown christians that we can get out of here lord and go home we thank you for all things that you have given us even this temporary home we thank you for giving us that lord our jobs and our health and all the different things our family and all the different things that you give us lord to even be here in this first three dimensions lord you've give it to us lord for us to make a choice and may our choice be you father bless each one lord we ask in jesus name amen hebrews 9 verse 11 says but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the bloc by the blood well that's hard to say by the blood of bulls and goats bulls goats and calves bob got me messed up and now he's got it up there he's bob's running out so you can blame him but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us so you may be seated in the lord's blessing but remember what we're trying to get get to this plan of redemption is not changed can't change won't change will not change in midstream this is the plan the plan will work god's already saw it work why why in the world would you uh you know you you put your faith in this and you put your faith in in your car and i see some of y'all you know you you put faith in your car and your car maybe your mule kicks every once in a while and something part falls off but now with god his parts don't fall off this planet he has and once you get on it it's going to take you to the future home amen and then god knew that you would decide make the choice of whether to be a part of it or not so he having obtained eternal redemption for us and as we're going to read here in ephesians again as we always read because he told us he chose us in him so we were chosen in him but let's read the first quote from job 1955 brother brown says redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the planet of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god foreseeing see there's always foreknowledge reason we have a problem with that word for knowledge because we don't have it i wish well sometimes not i wish we were foreknowing but god is he's not have a problem with that god foreknew he foreknew the plan he foreknew the destiny he for he foresaw what was going on and and like someone said he said i don't want to know what tomorrow holds he said i might not want to be there so see that's what brother brown tells us he said you know he said god gives us what we need but god saw down through 6 000 years of time what was going to happen who was going to be here who what choice they were going to make and even as brother dale was talking this morning i thought you know brother brown says and the bible tells us that your thoughts are louder in heaven than they are on earth why they've already been said up there they've already been said in the mind of god whatever your thoughts are you thought it before the foundation of the world in the mind of god not you standing up there thinking it but he knew when you got here what you would think amen so why be scared man the promises of god just hold on to the promises of god because the promises of god will never fail he'll lead us and guide us into what he's saying he promised us all truth not just part truth all truth all right so god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world so see adam was covered eve was covered they were already covered before they got here right if not he would have had to kill adam just as soon as what they did and surely he would have killed eve without even asking adam because we're going to see that that when we get to this land of paradise see paradise is not the fifth dimension and paradise is not the sixth dimension paradise was a place of holding in the old testament to prove that they didn't have the new birth in the old testament i'll read it to you because the blood of bulls and goats wouldn't allow them to go into the sixth dimension or into a dimension higher they had to wait until christ died and when he did he what he emptied out paradise and we'll talk about that in just a minute but look at titus 1 verse 1 says in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began so when did god promise you eternal life before the world began when did he pay for your eternal life before the world began amen you've just got to connect yourself to it i like what one preacher said one time he said he said make sure that you have attached yourself to eternal life because you didn't come here with it you got to find it find god and attach yourself to it and once you attach yourself to eternal life then that means you're chosen in him so whatever he gets you get right and man that's why the bible tells us in romans he says we're what heirs and joint heirs in christ amen so whatever he gets we get so guess what if he had obtained if he has obtained eternal redemption for us we're the recipient of it and we enter into that and now you're a part of the plan of redemption because somebody's going to get redemption through you a cup of water in my name being good to the bride somebody's going to get eternal life by just being good to you now they won't be bribed they won't be living in the city but guess what they'll be eternal they won't be in a burning hell they will be eternal because of you so that makes you brother chris a part of the plan of redemption you're sisters you say well we don't preach you preach a sermon every time you get up out of the out of the chair and go get in a car and go down to walmart or go down to target or go down to wherever and you are an example of christianity and they'll either somebody be condemned by what they say about you or they'll be given eternal life by what they said about what you are doing on this earth thank god for that that's that makes you part of the plan man right you are part of the plan of redemption that's why the whole christ is the mystery of god reveal that's why that i believe that brother brown told us to go back to christ the mystery of god revealed if we didn't get it in the seals go to christ the mystery god revealed because it's what where's christ revealed amen in you paul even picked that up and he said christ in you the hope of glory to me that's the seventh seal is to realize that where christ is christ is in you christ in you the hope of god but how are we going to learn about this through preaching amen through preaching and studying right there it says in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times manifested his word to preach in other words paul's saying he made the promise before the world was even formed but he's going to have to get it to you by some way he's got to come to you by some way it's got to come and even the bible tells us the foolishness of preaching because you would think oh man why do i have to that's the plan that's the plan you can't change it i was going to say a certain city can't change it but you know what i'm talking about and people can't change the word of god nobody can change the word of god through the foolishness of the five-fold ministry you will be perfected no other way amen too much too much complacency when you just have to press play as brother aaron was talking about wednesday night just a lot of complacency when you just kind of can sit somewhere and turn it off when you get tired you need to eat your potato chip or something or or change you know changing into your jammies and no it's an effort to overcome to get to church it's an effort i know it is and some of you drive a lot further than i do i think about this the other day some of you drive hour and a half sometimes two hours and you know we live eight miles away we we're fortunate in that to be that way but some of you it's a little bit more of a struggle but i believe god will give you a lot more blessings right you know god will bless you right hopefully it freaks your transmission well we all with transmission now what's going on here i think the sister johnny's check engine light came on several others around here but we're going to pray that you'll get to like tc we'll get them things fixed we won't have to deal with them no more ephesians one verse one or let's go to verse four according to us he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption now brother dale i'm sure is going to cover this but you everybody's predestinated to adoption everybody because you receive according to romans 8 verse about 14 or so it says you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry father father or daddy daddy you're a crime babbling baby you start out down at the bottom of the pyramid you start out with diapers you start out with drinking milk amen right but he doesn't want you to stay that way because he's given you he's predestinated someone to come to adoption so he had to make a way like they told the the the color brother you know he said well uh mose can you jump through that wall and he said well if he said if god wants me to he said he'll have to make a hole if god tells me to jump through the wall he'll have to make a hole for me to get through it so god made us a way to come to adoption right here verse 5 by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory i was thinking this morning you know brother dale you're speaking on the predestination what's john 3 16 for god so loved not one individual for god now he knows who won't who will but he's got to put the blanket out there because how many times have you heard that for god so loved the world he loved everybody in the world he has no haters there's no hatred towards somebody the the the part of it is is you're hating god i didn't like him too much when i was coming up i wanted to do the things that was contrary to him i don't know about you but i wanted to do them then you know what he took the one out when he took the one out and i attached myself to that eternal guess what paul says we must have the mind of christ not a mind of christ or not a part of the mind of christ that thought about adolf hitler and judas and all these different ones no you and i are literally a part of that thought we're not just the thought that goes out right as we're looking at in the fourth dimension it's not just that thought but we receive it and it becomes a reality what you receive on the books and the tapes and from preaching and from talking to brothers and sisters when it sparks a revelation in your heart that's eternal that didn't come from this first three dimensions you can't you can't communicate with god in these first three dimensions the devil's playground is right here because remember god is not in time god is in life but it's eternal life and god's also in matter because he made the world you look at the first verse god created the heaven and the earth he created matter before he created you something solid something that we can that he when he put adam on it there was adam and then adam got to walk on this matter but what happened though at the fall and i hope you're getting this when the fall happened it slowed everything down to where now the day you eat thereof that day you'll die you can't take your matter matter and take it into another dimension now adam couldn't move all the way around the world and be just have all control no he was confined because why a carnal mind began to tell him now he's got to be a daddy he's got to be he's got to be a father he's got to be a husband he's got to be this he's got to be that he was it just shrank down to where these dimensions that brother adam was telling us i pulled the quote up but i didn't bring it where there was a fog came over the earth and there was a fog came over adam basically between his soul and the rest of him because remember let me tell you something i was thinking about that this morning my brother dale was preaching something just struck about a virgin you know a virgin is you can say well i'm not a virgin if you're born again today you better be one but you're only virgin in your soul right your soul is a chaste virgin to christ one man amen now we came through all the other husbands that's why they all got to be dead right that's why that's got to die if that died do you know if a if a sister is married and her husband dies and she marries again she's a virgin amen now not like the catholic does it's not going to convert you back to a real one you understand what i mean but in god's eyes what a great god what if he just said no what if he just said no no way you've got to live single the rest of your life no he made provisions if your husband dies your wife died you're free to marry only in the lord we know those they're stipulations but still there is stipulations that you can do that well that's why that christ can be married to you when all your husbands are dead he can marry you and you're a virgin so in your soul you're we're all virgins in saul and god works in that soul right boy not in my notes but i'd like to preach on that for about two hours the virginity of your soul the purity right and you know what being a virgin you don't know a man you hadn't known a man yet so you don't know all the junk that needs to be right oh come on that's why paul said he said i wish that you could stay the way you are why he knew all the things that he said you know remember brother brown said he that brother brown talked about that he said well he paul said i wish the the boys would stay celibate and the women would stay celibate he said because then you have christ as your head then you have to put more into christ but once you get married you got a wife then you got an economy then you got friends and you got in-laws and then you got you understand what i'm saying it's not to say please if you want to get married if you have a desire please do it's the most wonderful thing in the world besides salvation is being married to a wonderful woman amen and the men said amen i don't know how i got onto that but we're we're on stealing ephesians one in whom we have redemption through his blood but see that's all part of it though because see you and i were dirty we were prostitutes but by the plan of redemption he has taken what was bad rahab woman at the well he has taken that bad and made it pure now he couldn't turn rahab back to a virgin but in type you and i were just like her we had all kind of thoughts seeds planted but when christ comes along when salman said where's your accuser she said i don't have any they're all dead right that's right jesus looked at that woman and said i can't even condemn you because i haven't seen it he doesn't see our sin he hears our voice this is all part of the plan of redemption in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has to bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us not somebody else not another church age he's made known to us the mystery of his will and brother brown said what was his will to adopt us so we've come to the stage you heard where brother branham was on that tape where he's talking about luther being the two shoots couldn't come to total perfection now they were born again in the body of christ but that's not perfection you can't perfect you're not even got a seed yet but when you come even to the stalk not seed yet but the seeds inside of it come to the tassel not seed yet but it covers the seed but you and i are come back to where we have exactly what was planted in the ground two thousand years ago called jesus christ you and i are part of that we are that seed now and what are we doing with that seed we're planting it in soil we're planting it in earth and watching the fruits come up through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost the plan of redemption according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times it took time it took time to go through the church ages it took time to get a prophet here on earth it took time that we could understand what a first seal was and the second seal on the third seal and all the different seals where we could understand the revelation that was what sealed up until the end time glory then in a disposition of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ in other words not not in 13 000 denominations in the message but one one both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we also have obtained an inheritance being predestinated what according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will god knows down through time and he said okay you're going to need a martin luther okay you're going to need a john wesley okay you're going to need the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost 1906. then i'm going to send a prophet according to malecon 4 we're going to need that listen we can sit and listen to a good justification message but what's that going to get us right it's not even going to put us in the body good justification message but if you'll preach a progression of justification it'll take you to what adoption amen those who he's justified he's already glorified but you know what it's not just a you don't just drop kick it into into heaven nope you got a what play the game right you got to get in the plan and listen this plan will work it's already worked if we'll realize that i'll read you a quote in a minute i think i may have left it i think i left it till later where brother brown said what do we fear it's all been destroyed by jesus christ it's all been destroyed when he came out of that grave he conquered death hell in the grave romans 8 28 we know all things work together good them to love the lord or love god to them who are be called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate i'm just going to read through this we've covered it brother dale's going to cover it real good on wednesday night also did predestinate what to be conformed to the image listen god didn't have to conform to your image your image is rotten my image was rotten the first image that came on this earth that i'm looking at is dying but if you're conformed to what to image the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and then the next statement is god be for us who can be against us all right so let's read number one we've already read this before but i think brother dale may have read it this morning but the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better is everybody getting this i'll promise you look at man wake up there is a rotten wrong teaching in this message about predestination it's false it will lead you nowhere false doctrine cannot take you up that statue of a perfect man you can say what you want to you might get part of it who just wants part of god right i want everything he's got the door open for me and you the door's open the door's open for me and you you know what step in taste and see that the lord is good you've got to reach and get it off the table and put it in your mouth predestination looks back to foreign just what i mean you got to look for knowledge four no four new right four known 4c before anything he four knew he also forned you all these false doctrines too he foreign the good with the bad sorry you know why that way he can make sure that his plan works because he looks at the tactics of the devil and he's he's just his plan is going to work and you know what he's going to make the poor old devil he's a part of the plan because he's the one that torments me and you every day right he's the one that gets us he's the one that gets us and we have to repent we have to say i'm sorry god doesn't mind you saying i'm sorry he hates it when you don't amen or forgive me lord but god's not going to set an order a little whole did everybody understand that that's what brother dale was talking about god did not predestinate cement he didn't just say this is it right here going no other way no he saw what would happen he knew what you would choose therefore he could predetermine your destiny that's what pre-determined or predestinate but look he predestinated us to be conformed to his image there's a group of people that's why you can't say well now i'm predestinated so it doesn't matter what i do now that's one in doctrine in the message i'm predestinated i'm already in the millennium already i'm already this great something well then you get adulteries you get drunks you get sorry i see it i can name names because of these doctrines that's come through the message you know why because it's so close it's so close it makes you feel good makes you want to do other things no let's stay in the word of god if it's born to you then it just be born to you but the word of god is the word of god and the way it's taught around here we don't run the aisles and we don't scream and holler and and maybe you like that that's okay it's all right to get somebody in that does but what are you hearing what are you taking home what are you applying to your life i really would rather you sit and be quiet and listen i really would i like a little bit of shouting and emotion that's not bad at all don't get me wrong but can you sit down and tell me what i just said that don't happen a lot you can't do three things at once i promise you but anyway now where'd that come from but set an order like a little hole so see that's what god god then what predestinates by what not by his will by your will if god predestinated for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believes in him now look that's a big old blanket but now remember he knew who would and who wasn't but he can't just say for god so loved the world that ray gabriel's the only man that's going to get it and i'm going to send my son remember what brother brown says about that he says some people think that and i've heard it myself well jesus came down here to die and whoever felt sorry for him enough that's who he was going to save oh come on people good grief no he knew before the foundation's world who he is coming for but being god being a righteous judge bible calls him a righteous judge so in other words he's not a judge that is that is like the judge that you go to that couldn't make a mistake listens to two sides does not have foreign knowledge he has to take what evidence that he's given and sometimes a lawyer will give them false evidence nothing against lawyers but they lie they'd like to protect their client satan does that but god's already seen the end from beginning he already knows what happened he knows what's going to happen so in god in order to be god he knowed the end from the beginning so he could predict and set things in order to happen right you know god even before the foundation of the world he knew we'd want to go see the grand canyon he knew some people would love mountains he knew some people would love valleys he knew some people would love um oceans and seas and different things like that he knew that that's why he put it out here got of variety he's the one that made it all these different natural wonders why is there seven seven's completion he made seven natural wonders and nobody can make them things but god nobody can make them things and give man knowledge to do these things but seven natural wonders all right now here's a here's a wonder that that man has wondered at since the beginning of time number two how can i take a cuckleberry and make a grain of wheat out of it right impossible for me to do it the only way it can be done is because inside that cucumber has been transmitted from a cockaburr wheat a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life then you bury that kookaburra it'll produce a grain of wheat that's the whole thing satan thinks he's got you boy he's got prophet's up there in jeffersonville and he's been dead for 60 years and that kuckleberg is laying up there dead boy is he going to get a is he going to get a uh rude awakening when when the rapture gets red will not rapture but when the dead saints come out of the ground he's gonna go pick that kuckleberry up because it was transferred one day to a grain of wheat that grain of wheat is gonna pick that kuckleberry up and make it a wheat we're gonna come right back here brother tatum and all the different ones they're coming back they're not coming back as cuckoo birds they're coming back as sweet because the wheat is greater than the cucumber what's inside you today by the new birth is greater than anything man can produce on the face of this earth doesn't matter what it is and even though like if we get to it we'll get to if we don't we won't the fourth dimension listen you and i are barred from the fourth and the fifth dimension and the sixth dimension in this life we're barred from it can anybody here listen if you're hearing voices in your head we need to you need some prayer i mean really but you can't hear am 55 going through your head right now if you can then hold your hand up we're going to pray for you but can you no you're listening to me or you're listening somewhere else or your mind's over somewhere else right but it's going right through this building brother brown said radio waves going right through this building it doesn't matter about the thickness of the walls but it's going right through this building right but you can't pick it up see we're barred from it we've been barred from the sixth dimension brother branham was allowed to go beyond the curtain of time to tell us what he saw but he had to come back into this dimension and he died in this dimension he couldn't take this he couldn't take his natural body over to the sixth dimension no one's ever took their natural body why because cuckoo bird stays here the wheat's what goes in the other dimension because it's what it's christ that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in the kuckelberg and the life of the cuckoo bird has been taken out but the nature of the cocoa bear is still sticky he's talking about the outside guy and it will be until this new life has fully been developed now we've read that enough we know that when will that happen that will happen at the change but listen i'm going to tell you something we got to get so close to that in this life until the dead saints will come out of the ground by what we say that kookaburra may be standing there that's why that the devil he can't understand it you know we're all sitting here we're getting older we're all we're all have trials and tribulations and the devil's going why can't they just stay home why can't they just curse god and die why can't they just because that's all he knows he can't get in that inside of the inside of you he can't change that inside man once you've been what once that nature's been dead taken out of you and be alive the bible says in christ satan can't understand that why he's not been that's not happened to him because he decided that that's not what was going to happen to him amen pretty simple psalms 139 says my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth you and i had to come to this earth we had to when what happened to adam and eve that stuck him in those three dimensions and then you had to have the sex act in that dimension because it never happens in any other dimension only in the first three time life and matter it happens in this dimension it can't happen in another dimension amen we have a spiritual birth a spiritual seed planting from now on but you've got to get here first by psalms 1 39-16 the knights did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them your name was written in the book of life before the foundation of the world because god knew you'd want it but see he knew that judas is carrot's name could be put in the book of life and be taken out because of the things he done while he got here and see a lot of the things you brother branham you know the brother brown tells you if you if you really break it down and we've we've done it over the years brother dale has not we brother they broke it down to us and even brother brown tells us he said when you become sanctified your name goes on the book as a believer well now it's it's an act of a play it's not an angel sitting up there going well now his name wasn't on here so i'm just going to write it on and then i'm going to erase it off if i need to no it's an acts of a play it's it's an allegory it's telling you what happens that you brother brown said your name goes on the book as a believer so you move into a believer mentality under sanctification but now that doesn't put you in the lamb's book of life that's been there before the foundation of the world and it's not going to ever be changed but you've got to move over into that and god knows whether you will or you won't really pretty simple all right let's look at the dimensions real quick light time and matter and he proved it in luke 16 verse 25 let's go to that said but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise lives with evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented bless you and besides all this between us and you there's a great gulf fixed in other words there's something there but now remember they can see each other see in the in the old testament you got to remember there were several things that happened you look at the witch of endor i heard brother branham uh preaching the other day he said that some people said that that she just saw like an apparition brother brown said no she saw samuel because she said i see god's and said why have you told me this and there's their sin he said brother brown said there stood samuel in his prophet's robe had on his prophets clothes and he was standing there and it wasn't an apparition he said because that thing talked back to her and he prophesied still in another dimension in paradise he prophesied and looked at psalms said tomorrow you're going to be with me so how real is that but now brother brown said you can't do that now you can't bring somebody out of another dimension why because the the fifth dimension was set up the sixth dimension was set up later on when jesus christ i believe when he emptied up paradise see you can't do that anymore and and you know for those of you that went with us to jeffersonville a few years ago i'll just say this they used that as a as a scripture to bring brother branham back heard it with her own ears i just can't that's to me that's grabbing its straws that's old testament that's a witch bringing a prophet back how in the heavenly days do you want to get a witch to bring brother branham back but that was their whole pretense as well that happened back then it can happen now but remember that only happened under the blood of the bulls and goats that did not happen and cannot happen now because we'll look and read that paradise was emptied out when jesus came and went and preached to the souls in prison brother brown said he came right back up picked up paradise and took him into another dimension right everybody got that luke 17 says beside luke 16 says and besides all this between us and you there's a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from this in other words there's no way to cross back and forth into another dimension once you're dead you're dead i mean even though the witch of endor brought samuel up into this dimension it didn't change samuel right it really didn't change saul he was going to die the next day anyway right so it didn't change anything right and see it didn't change anything when brother brown went across the curtain of time because he had to come back into this dimension his soul went to that dimension his body didn't go that's right do i need to read it we've read it for years he said i look back and there laid my body on the bed so what was in the sixth dimension his soul somehow had transferred out of his body for mine in your for us not for anybody else but for our whatever for our information to take away the sting of death because paul said death we're just standing great for your victory now remember he went across the curtain of time but remember he only saw his people all right brother brown didn't see paul's people he only saw his people he said who are these branhams he said no they're your converts he said well did paul make it well you know what if paul was in that dimension he could have looked in saw paul he didn't see paul he saw his converts you will be gathered with your people right and brought before the lord the ones that will be last to be first the ones will be first to be last amen but it didn't change brother branham it changed him sure it changed him you understand what i mean it didn't change him where he had to stay over in this dimension actually he's been there he went over there to look and tell us but he had to come back and get back in that kookaburra again that his mom and daddy brought but he come to a place to realize that wasn't his real mama and daddy really you understand what i mean but then he had to physically die and that kuckleberg is laying up there and i hate to say that but that's just what we are every one of us paul kookaburr irenaeus martin that part that was brought here by mom and daddy having an act he's got to stay here but the soul is what's the important thing that's what moves between the dimensions that's what god can speed up and god can make faster we can't do it sure god's give us a radio or or whatever we want to say television to receive that information from another dimension but you and i are not going to go to that dimension we're not going to the fourth dimension we're either going to five or six you're not going to seven either because you're already in seven inside your soul sitting in heavenly places right let's don't don't let's don't be confused but we've got light time and matter now remember time will continue but one day time's going to run out right when we get into the future home there'll be no time amen but we're still going to have light and we're still going to have matter so it's not going to do away with all that but it's going to be a different kind of light it's not going to be a light that we need we need sunlight listen if we didn't have natural sunlight we'd die right natural sunlight if we didn't have spiritual sunlight spiritually you'll die wither up and die and let's pray that lord give us some sunshine i've had enough of this gloomy weather but if this is what god wants us to have but you know what we can pray you say how you just said that you can't change god knows whether you're going to pray or not god knows whether you're going to pray earnestly that it rain or play earnestly that it don't rain amen let's look at number two let's skip number one present stage of my ministry brother brown tells us about time light and matter you have five senses of the body see tastes filled smell and hair now none of these senses will declare god what did god give us those five senses for to declare the earth or to what contact with the earth now listen let me get this point to you that even though adam had to be put in the human body amen it wasn't that he was blind and then when god put him in a human body you could see no remember adam ruled the world not even in a flesh body yet spiritual body first then he put him in a natural body everybody got that same man amen put him in a natural body so that he can declare those senses to the earth but before then he could see and not like i think somebody said one time said well we didn't know about our senses well man look at him over in the sixth dimension brother brown said i felt them i knew they were women right when they hugged them but there was look there was no filial love there was no lust it was all agape love when you take all that other love out you can hug a sister don't try it now go see you're in this dimension still got to carnal minds kucleber still works amen but when we get over the other side he had feeling he had questions who is that right right and the lady said that 90 year old woman was was uh converted in your in your ministry and he said there she was a 18 year old beautiful woman so he had sea taste filled smelling here but it's greater than he had in this dimension and that's the same way with you and i this is just this is the so limited part of our listen this is the most limited you'll ever be even though we look at the advancement of science we might get in fourth dimension we may not but you look at the advancement of science and you see what they've done you know they got rockets now used to when they shot the rocket out you know the rocket would have to go at an angle and this part would drop off and this part would drop off and then it would come back and it would have to have a parachute and they'd have to go out there in the middle of the ocean and pick them up right they're not doing that now you see them the other day i think it was elon musk they got two rockets they fired them they went out went around the world come back and landed right on the same path that they that they went off on landed them things looked just like a pencil sticking up and they just landed it right back on earth technology do you know your cell phone well some of you maybe danny's flip phone i don't know about that but someone says what is a flip phone i saw one another day at walmart they were giving them away i think but uh you've got more technology in your phone today than was on the first lunar what they sent to the moon not just going around the world what they sent to the moon you've got more technology in your phone than they did taking them to the moon and back you've got it in your phone you see how much advance well now how far though i was thinking of the day how far advanced that is you're going to let the devil advance further than god if that happens in the natural you and i should end the spiritual we should be more advanced than we were before we should be able to hear from god brother brown said we would have supernatural intelligence be able to hear from god but none of these senses we got declares god when god made man he made him in his image instead of man's and he put him in five senses to contact his earthly home not to contact god with but now remember you've got to contact through that to get to god but remember what you see what you see is not all god you understand what i mean taste filled smelling here these senses don't declare god they declare the earthly home where the man had to contact his earthly home he had to see taste field in here but by but faith is the substance now see faith you can't see it you can't touch it you can't feel it you can't taste it literally you understand what i mean literally but by spiritual eye of faith by spiritual hearing by spiritual feeling and the bible says taste and see that the lord is good so there's your taste see taste phil smelling here but look by faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you do not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it see what i mean now we're continuing a little bit further exodus 20 and john 12 we see many times people saw the thundering and the lightning and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoke what was happening god was bringing the message to moses on the top of a mountain amen john 12 28 says father glorify thy name then came their voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again how is he going to glorify it again in me and you amen we got to have a thunder sound in this message the people therefore that stood by though heard it that it thundered like brother chris said you know and i've met people this is oh we leave those seals along we leave those thunders along we don't know what you're not preaching the message then you're not preaching the message if you're not preaching the seals and the thunderstorm oh yeah you got little you got your milk but brother brown didn't come just to give us milk paul gave us milk but he said i like strong meat and that's what we got the people therefore stood by heard it listen we heard the thundering how many millions of people by the way of the fourth dimension has heard the prophet of god's voice millions untold millions upon millions have heard it they heard it in the time of the prophet and a lot of them will tell you that they just went to see the miracles yeah they'll tell you that if they're real honest they just went to see the miracles so they weren't hearing them sure they were hearing what was going on they were seeing what was going on but they weren't getting the message not in the years of preparation i mean brother diego was talking about it's not in the years of preparation but when he brings in other words when he thunders something that no one else can understand except the bride it's something for me and you the people around it are going to get thunder they're going to get hear a voice they're going to see this they're going to see lights flashing but do they hear the voice because that voice is not just to this ear it's to your spiritual here revelations 10 verse 1. so almighty angel this is all for me and you verse 4 and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write in other words john saw what they said so if john can write it i ought to be able to understand it because john was born again believer just like i am but he did not have a prophet a seventh angel prophet telling him what they said we have had a seventh angel prophet messenger tell us what it said because of what happened out in arizona in 1962 we'll read that in a second but look jehovah jair in 1961 they tell me when a plane is trying to get through the sound barrier it just almost shakes the bolts out of it have you ever watched when chuck yeager broke broke the sound barrier he thought the plane was going to fall apart but once he got through that 700 miles an hour broke the sound barrier he said it was just like floating on ice no nothing it's just getting through that one little and that was everybody see that's that barrier that everybody's afraid of because it starts shaking about 600 miles an hour and you think you're you think your plane's going to fall apart but look what brother brown said look it almost shakes the bolts out of it but after through that sound barrier it's all right then it can just run with ease if we can just break through that static of superstition and things then the holy spirit just begins to fall around like anointing and just blesses the people but so many people of today are so babied just petted little petty what once the ship starts shaking the rats get off first sorry about that who's the first one off anyway but see man had come to a natural thing that he came to that sound bear they would always they'd get to that 600 mile an hour spot and they'd back off they'd get to that 600 mile an hour spot maybe 620 and they'd think man this my life's gonna fall apart everybody get everybody with me now my life's gonna fall apart because everything's shaking but if they would have only went i think it's 620 miles an hour is when it really starts shaking if they'd only went just push the throttle that's what chuck yeager did he said i just made myself push the throttle because he still had throttle left he said i made myself force that throttle he said when i did when i hit that 800 mile he said that thing went kaboom everybody heard it he said but it was just like flying on ice he said there was no bumps you see it was just smooth sailing is that what me and you've come up to is that what men you've come up to in our life just remember just a few more miles an hour just to press that throttle just a little bit more listen when things get hard press the throttle right yeah how you want to get out of a shaking car donnie how you want to get out of shaking car that that salad you know that thing will get about 60 miles an hour and hear that thing will start going thinking i gotta because your wheels are out of balance but what you either back off or go 70. let's go 70. right let's push through this thing i know some people are worried about the virus and people are worried about these different things humanly we all should be worried we should all be cautious but still we if we don't push through this thing just like chuck yeager he said i knew there was more throttle listen there's more to this then what we're seeing there's more throttle have you ever seen a i'm you don't have to forgive me i'm watching airplane videos i may want to try to fly an airplane one day but anyway you got a throttle and you push that thing all the way to the front ryan's downstairs he knows what i'm saying that throttle goes all the way in well that's your takeoff speed but you don't keep that throttle up there to blow the engine up you have to back the throttle back off some but what chuck yeager he said i looked down he said i saw there was about two or three more inches of throttle and he said i just he went through the sound barrier and see now that was only 700 miles an hour a regular airplane that you fly flies at about 500 miles an hour so it's normal now i mean you got jet fighters that fly at 1500 miles an hour so they're twice what chuck yeager was why because the advancements of technology you have artificial intelligence now that all flies the plane for you right brother brown says here let's just condense this down number four reason i'm saying this i want you to know what happened in this end time what broke a sound barrier in this end time no other time the wright brothers 30 miles an hour in a pedal bicycle run off of kitty hawk and made it about 100 feet at 30 miles an hour with a bicycle you know twirling the propellers then you had the old stop with camel that you had won i mean it was maybe 100 miles an hour then you come up with a jet engines and then you come up and you got now supersonic right they just those two rockets was like at 14 000 miles an hour 14 000 miles an hour wow there was a blast let's go on down he's talking about the birds watch it was little birds bigger birds no sooner that day got out of my sight i turned again westward what happened there was a blast that shook the whole earth what was happening the sound barrier was being broke by a supersonic jet they can call whatever that is they want to it wasn't a jet it was god coming into this dimension to give us something that's never been here before they've never had a cloud like this but every time you break the sound barrier you look at the pictures when that thing goes at 700 miles an hour there's a cloud forms all the way around the airplane oh hallelujah there's a there's a it's around us now you just gotta see it you say brother wade that's wrong no the bible says a great cloud of witness we've got it all around us why because we're breaking the sound barrier how do you think we're going to get out of here we're going to have to break some kind of barrier to leave this earth not leave just step over into a faster dimension right right that was a blast that actually shook the whole earth for those of you on tape if you don't believe this you turn it off okay i'm giving you time i'm gonna take a drink of water first a blast thought it sounded like a sound barrier ever what you call it when planes cross the sound the sound comes back to the earth just shook like roared everything then it could have been a a great clap of thunder and lightning light i didn't see the lightning i just heard that great blast that went forth that sounded like it was south from me towards mexico but it shook the earth and when it did i was still looking westward and way off into where eternity i saw a constellation of something coming it looked like it might have been little dots remember brother brown said i sat up there in the woods and he said i want to get something from god he said 2 times 2 is 4. 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4 2 includes 4. what coming down into this dimension faster from a faster place into this place that's why i believe that cloud came those angels came from an eternal dimension into this dimension there could have been no less than five no more than seven but they were in the shape of a pyramid like these messengers coming and when it did the power of almighty god lifted me up to meet them he's the only man that could have survived that if not somebody else would have and i can see it it's never left me eight days is gone and i can't forget it yet i never had anything to bother me like this my family will tell you i could see those angels those shaped back wings traveling faster than sound could travel they came from eternity listen what we got the message we got came from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eye that bible not enough to bat your eye just to twinkle they were there i didn't have time to count we know there were seven afterwards he comes back and tells it again i don't have time no more than just look mighty ones great powerful angels snow white winged set heads and they were and when it did i was caught up into this pyramid a constellation they came into light time and matter and it made a noise it created a cloud but was it the picture that was took or was it the experience that he had that you and i are looking at right no we're looking at the voice that came behind it we're looking at the voice that came into this light time and matter and was put on recording tape and that you and i can hear it and it's the voice of god speaking to us thank you lord that we're recipients of that because you know what there's a group of people said that's false there's a group of people said that was just a regular rocket a group of people don't even know that that even exists when you look at people and you go to a flea market and you go hey you got a time magazine is it time or life time you got time magazine 1963 you know whatever it is and they're going dude i wasn't even born back then why because it doesn't mean nothing to them but to you and me how much would we pay to get one somebody want to say how much they paid to get one i think it's up in about 300 now just to buy a 25 cent why because it means something to us but listen it means nothing if you ain't got the voice behind it because remember this whole thing that whole scene don't turn it that whole scene was to take brother branham and put him in a position of adoption if you want to say that and but he told him to go back to jeffersonville the seals were not revealed out there in arizona he said go they said go back to jeffersonville it'll be told you then what to do but he had to have an experience first knowing that it came from eternity and that he was going to get a message that was going to break a group of people out of this three dimensions and get us out of here because the seals are the full plan of redemption not just part it's the full plan of redemption everybody okay say amen all right let's let's just do the fourth dimension and we'll do the fifth later on brother bob you won't have to pull up all that but if you got your little things here you can look on it says fourth dimension is the tree of knowledge and see that fourth dimension is where all that knowledge is science if you look here at science or the tree of knowledge brother brown tells us that man has what broken into god's laboratory because when you look in this fourth dimension that's where i picked up a bunch of things i'm going to read a few of them to you it's really interesting then we'll close we'll pick this up next time brother i'm number five let's read present stage in my ministry now but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact that but yet they have a tube or a crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifests them so you see right in this building now it's live actions of people in the air live voices they're here they're absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they catch it on i don't understand the mechanics of these things that science has embedded but we know that it proves to us that there is a fourth dimension now we know there is a fourth dimension why because you turn on radio you're going to talk on a cell phone you go to the internet right if you're on the internet with wi-fi you're not connected to anything remember when brother branham even you take 1945 i was looking into even the principles of radio was in the 1880s 1880s the principle i said not the radio the principle of it but remember in 1945 you look at the tree of knowledge every time there's a war there's an advancement after the war why because they bring the greatest scientists they have they bring the greatest people they have and they put them together and say look we need this then when world war ii was after over 1945 when did brother brown start preaching in 1947 they already had radio so now that he can have that radio or that wire thing or that new advancement he calls it so god is letting us use the tree of knowledge of good and evil but man has used it to bring what to bring all the raw things i was thinking the other day you know even in 1962 you look at what brother branham was talking about going through now sure there was how many of you remember 19 even 1968 and 70 there was only four channels right four television channels two five eleven and if you got the antenna turned the right way you might get green for one every once in a while and you can watch wrestling on saturday morning hello somebody didn't miss that wrestling that was channel four but you had to turn the you had to turn you had to go outside and turn that you see what that was from the 60s now look at we've got what six 800 channels now that they got look at what we have to deal with and you you don't think i'm an idiot but listen brother branham when he was there in the 40s think of the airwaves wasn't full of a lot of stuff understand what i mean there was no internet there was no cell phones didn't even have shortwave radios except the government had them but you didn't have them so when he said there was people going through here in 1963 even he talks about and on the sixth seal i believe it was he's talking about voices going through this room people going through the room it wasn't so full think about right now how many billions of cell phones there are and billions i mean billions there's not millions there's billions of cell phones that are on now well according to your pastor you better not have them on right now but if you you know what though if you turned your phone on i could call jamaica stand right here and talk to brother keith reed right so his voice must be in this room somewhere but the same guy that's watching pornography two doors down i don't know who he is doesn't matter but you know what i'm saying that's going through here too what brother branham saw he knew we would have to overcome all that but you know what so did god right god knew we would have to be equipped totally different we had to be the astronaut that wore the helmet that wore the pressurized suit and you know even in advancement you know they got up so far flying an airplane and you get up to whatever how many thousand feet 12 15 18 000 feet and your oxygen runs out a lot of airplane pilots died because they tried to get on up a little bit higher and they didn't have any oxygen well then the government comes up with the oxygen tank with a little it wasn't nothing but a tube you stuck the tube in your mouth and you got fresh oxygen so you could get up to 20 000 feet but they were freezing themselves to death because it was like five degrees up there but now guess what you and i fly 35 and 40 thousand feet just in a regular jetliner we're sitting there with slippers on watching a television playing on our cell phone and eating a meal look at the difference that tree of knowledge of good and evil let's read this next quote and then we'll read two quotes and then we'll stop countdown 1962. now we have known there's another dimension which is the fourth dimension because science has probed into it and found it and it is radio there's no senses of our body can detect radio or television over that ether wave yet right through us now is coming people's voices and i'll tell you how fast it is in just a minute right through here is coming television pictures but we have nothing in us no way at all to contact that in our self it takes a crystal of some for some sort now some of you young kids don't realize it but when we were all growing up you know why it's am 55.5 and 79 and 97 and 104.7 megahertz because in the old radios donnie what'd you have diamonds real diamonds little bitty teeny tiny ones but they were cut a certain way and that's what picked up a certain radio so it was either 104 cut for 104.7 because remember those of you that's old enough brother gage krantz knows what i'm talking about how many remembers when am fm was a option in a car how many can't remember when air conditioning was an option in a car a motor oh no but these kids don't realize that you could get standard am with no air conditioning no power steering and when have you ever done one of this one window okay some of you so not old enough to know that but that was an option but the radio was actually a dial and it physically dialed it it physically pushed a little red line across and what happened was is you would hit that crystal that was in that radio well that crystal was cut at a certain ohm and that certain ohm was what was in the air the certain wave and that's what picked that up of course now it's done been coming digital and all this other stuff but listen that's how it got started and look what it is now you don't have no you don't have a diamond in there you don't have to put a vic trolling needle in if you ever we used to have to change them needles old vic trolling needle you know because it just sit there and bounce play the same same song all over again skip three or four times they're coming back now anybody seen those things they're coming back now yeah all that stuff the deanna's got an old radio we bought her and it of course it's got all the advancements in it but it looks like one of them old radios and then she now she wants a 45. um she's got one doesn't she yeah she's got one but anyway all that old stuff comes back don't worry but it ain't got the technology that it had before and in a television you've heard brother dale and honestly the television was as big as this thing right here and the screen was about the size of that right there and you had tubes and it was hot man it was hot they were yeah there were tubes about that big around that it had light and you plugged them in or you had somebody come by and work on them you know you understand what i'm saying look at the advancement that fourth dimension has always been there but man has now been able to tap into it now totally unlimited can tap into it put 600 one television and put 600 channels through that one television internet service you get 10 000 youtube videos comes right through your house right into your little device you know what use that for god say god i am now a receptor i'm not just a cut diamond i'm a receptor please give me that give me that knowledge not always off the tree of life but the knowledge off of god pray and read your bible that's pretty tough there's no sense in our body can detect it but we have nothing in us no way at all to contact that in ourselves it takes a crystal of some sort a magnet to contact that but it speaks that there is another dimension now that's four dimensions now let's go to enticing spirits 1955. now this morning we're going to talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in people's body look at this now such as cancers and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease that it's in another dimension sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it right that's why my brother adam could stand there remember what's the first thing happened the first sign he got was what vibration in his hand remember he said the vibration is gone remember it would pimple up and all these different things but what was it vibration he said lady the vibration is gone your sickness is over right it was a vibration what it was another dimension those demons were he said oh can't you hear that demon that lady's got cancer over there and this lady's got cancer there's a black line going from one to the other and there's two demons screaming at each other for help what dimension was he in he wasn't in this one he was in the fourth dimension because he was a prophet any other time he wouldn't see all that but most of the time he he would always say i don't know what dimension i'm in i don't know where i'm at thank god you and i don't have to go through that but let me read you this real quick you don't have that on there we'll we're going we're going to talk about hell next time because hell is not a burning place at this moment we know that hell is a place of holding it is a place reserved in the fifth dimension brother brown said you're caught between heaven and hell i'm in heaven and heaven and earth you can't get back to earth you can't go to heaven but we'll cover that next time i want to read this it's not on there so just listen to what i'm saying i got this off i got this off the internet radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation best known for their use in communication technologies such as television mobile phones and radios these devices receive radio waves and convert them to mechanical vibrations in the speakers to create sound waves it's in waves listen to this the radio frequency spectrum is a relatively small part of electromagnetic spectrum the electromagnetic spectrum is generally divided into seven regions wake up this don't enter you can go outside seven regions hmm in order of decreasing wavelength and increasing energy and frequency according to the university of rochester the common designations are radial waves microwaves infrared ray visible light ultraviolet x-rays and gamma rays guess where we're stuck at out of those seven we're stuck right in the middle visible light's the only thing we can see and what is invisible light i mean visible light all the other is invisible we can't see them but we can see visible light oh come on yeah we see seven colors god not only put that in the sky back in noah's time he was telling us that's what you're going to see that's all you're going to see you're going to see because that the seven colors of the rainbow income passes every color that you've ever seen how many have ever went to home depot and they got colors for everything they got this wall plaster they come from seven colors of the rainbow and you can only see you and i can only see the seven colors of the rainbow we can't see radio waves we can't see microwave we can't see infrared we can't see ultraviolet we can't see x-ray and we can't see gamma rays but you know what there is a device and i'm not going to go through it there's a device for each one of them where you can see them right you can see the the manifestation of them all right the same way with god but watch this listen to this i'll tell you how fast this is then we'll close radio waves have the longest wavelength in the ultra electromagnetic spectrum according to nasa ranging from 0.04 inches to more than 62 miles they also have the lowest frequency listen to this radio waves the slowest frequency of radio waves travels 3 000 cycles per second when you say 1001 it's already circled a three it's already done three thousand cycles when you say one thousand 1001 that's how fast it is but they have the high spectrum which is 300 billion hertz or 300 gigahertz which means it cycles 300 billion times in one second that's how fast that radio wave is that's why it can go through and they go listen they go through and they tell you that you know you don't need much for here for surface right you don't need much because there's nothing that you have to go through then little walkie-talkies you get but now what about if you want to talk to a submarine what about if you want to talk to miners that are 20 20 miles into the ground they can talk to them they just change the speed of the radio wave and it penetrates further down now this is limited man what do you think god speaks to you with because you know what sometimes mine in your head is a lot harder than anything man's had to penetrate had to penetrate on this earth doesn't matter how many miles down or how many miles up you know they can communicate with satellites now that are on the moon and one at mars they got pictures guess what that cycle is over 300 billion cycles per second to get that picture who knows how many miles it is from here to mars it's further from here to california promise you that but those ready those things are coming and we're picking up pictures of another world listen by spiritual eyesight though see that's limited what man has done let's stand come come on musician by limited man we seem like we're almost unlimited but we haven't picked listen when them when a man passes away the bible says it doesn't matter if he's in the depths of the sea you know what the bible says that soul is going to go into some dimension it doesn't matter if you're ten thousand miles down in the earth and you die they're not gonna have to dig a hole to get you out sure your cuckoo bird is gonna stay there but your soul is gonna go right into another dimension a faster dimension a faster wave that's way past the 300 billion because 300 billion you can go right through that wall and not even it not even bother anything even at 3 000 cycles per second we're hearing radio i mean you put a little radio right here and you can pick up radio waves right here at 3 000 which is going through that wall at super super sonic speed and listen folks your new birth put you in another dimension in your soul your body's stuck in this but your soul is sitting in heavenly places your soul is communion with a god that can travel he doesn't need dimension one two three four five six seven sure we know he lives in seven right now but he can still come down here and visit you he can still come down here and talk to you by the baptism of the holy ghost he can come right there in your room and like i said before go through the thickest thing that ever was made on the face of the earth and that's your skull to get to your brain to tell you that he loves you to tell you that this plan of redemption is eternal so how do you exhaust anything that's eternal we're going to be talking about this plan if you know we got bible sure that bible but you know you can read that bible in probably a good day you could probably read it if you read fast enough but you didn't get won't get much out of it but what about living this thing though what about making each character come alive and each witness and each time somebody gets born again by one scripture then it opens up a whole another world how many worlds is the soul worth ten thousand worlds unlimited ten thousand worlds we think this earth is great your soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds but you know what god didn't leave us in this dimension folks he made a way for us to either get out of here by death or get out of here by the chains of the body we are going to go into another dimension and by the baptism of the holy ghost you're already in that dimension what we got to do is just let it start working on this thing he's still working on me right amen let's sing a song god bless you but that fourth dimension is right here god uses it but satan uses it too children listen we're influenced by the fourth dimension either good or bad because it's bombarding us whether we know it or not it's right there beating us and because you know what you're a spiritual being right you're human but you got a spiritual spirituality a part of you that is faster than the speed of light your soul but when you get born again god thank god he seals that in but see still that spirit world though that spirit world twirls around that brother chris and satan can jump right in there by that fourth dimension and he can try to influence me and you but you know what god said resist the devil and he'll flee from you you don't have to chant you don't have to even call the pastor for that one it's good to call and get pastor to pray for you don't get me wrong but if the devil's beating on you just resist him start singing boy that'll do it start singing a good gospel song i don't do it i'll guarantee you that'll that'll make him that'll make him want to leave so let's sing a song god bless you brother remember today's the anniversary of the cloud oh is it today's the anniversary of the cloud appearing that's right it is february 28th that's right so anyway so i didn't know that but thank you god bless you that cloud was real that cloud was given to us for a sign that cloud was not it was not william branham it's that man right there jesus christ william branham just happened to be the what he was the radio he was the receptor though but what did he do he slowed it down boy i just got that he slowed it down even he spoke slow his slow kentucky english but you know what that was god speaking to me and you he came from that other dimension and gave it to the prophet and the prophet broke it down and gave it to me and you right here in this dimension listen we needed it had to have it you can't get it any other way you cannot leave this earth without having this message in you and it be alive okay i'm sorry you just can't it is february 28th yes it is february you're right it's february 28th you're right man you're right if i didn't know that was the day that i thought it was in march but march is when he went out to the went out to arizona and yeah i could be wrong no i think you're right anyway february 28th okay bro chris knows see he don't have no hair to we have hair and it kind of bounces off we don't get much revelation but then ball-headed when they get pretty good in revelation god bless you let's thank us amen this thing all fly away i'll fly away oh some glad morning when this life is over [Music] it's already there we just gotta get to it john sawyer coming down now to heaven and came down to this dimension [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music] has flown [Music] [Applause] [Music] way [Music] listen to this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] stop thank you every time you listen to me every time the song leader says let's let them play one they're playing their heart out when you're singing and then they go right you can't hardly hear them i want to hear every one of you just like we're not singing i mean like we are singing you got it amen do it for the glory of the lord if you ain't got a set of lungs use your hands for your lungs all right so we're going to sing i'll fly away and then they're going to play one verse you ready i want to hear it or we going to do it again football coach said do it again didn't do it right that time i'm not talking just to you it's okay oh i'm going to fly away oh glory [Music] fly away [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that sounds good [Music] [Applause] second time [Music] i'll be raptured [Applause] remember we're eagles we're not earthbound birds this age we're supposed to not stand and look up and you know how brother branham would stand and he'd look up he said i always wanted to go places i'd see them airplanes go across well right there where me and terrence and daddy live is the flight pattern from the north part of hartsville when it was going very well you every minute there'd be a plane in three three sections here they come and you know what there was people up there in them and there was 30 000 feet between me and those people but they ain't 30 000 feet between you and god you ain't got to get up there you already got the vehicle inside your soul to bring that god glory to here every day god's not over the sea he's not away from you anywhere but you and i must realize we're heading toward the end of this thing and it's okay we can learn you know it's nice to learn the dimensions and all but use them use them for the glory of the lord call out to god study read your bible pray pray you don't have to plug in anything just pray pray without ceasing go down the road i know brother ryan does he sits there with chickens all dead chickens are live chickens all day long how did eagle get caught with chicken exactly but anyway i mean but you do study though right i mean you get i love brother ryan he gets his study time in sitting in the truck how many of y'all study just kind of sitting don't do it at a red light but but you pray without ceasing you've got you listen you don't need an instrument to contact god with i wish it was that easy by the way brother ray we go now for 49.95 and two ginsu knives you you can you can have this device that'll help you talk to god well everybody buy one and get the two knives but you don't have to have that all you got to have is what a soul sorry amen all you gotta have is a soul that's what god wants to contact he wants to contact your soul glory remember what brother brown said if i can ever get that soul what still long enough what realize you're lost realize now that you're born again realize that you're going up the statue of a perfect man realize that we need god more than anything else we need in this world and that prayer is cheap doesn't cost a dime you don't have to get hooked up to anything talk to god please and let him talk back to you let's make this year like i said before let's make this year to let that inside guy talk let him out he wants out he is in a prison house called your old self but if you'll let him out inside here your musicians same thing let it out pour it out to god and he'll pour it back to you and i hope he pours it out where you can't control it and your spoon will fall out of your bowl right aaron god bless you let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray that something lord has been said to help us lord we tomorrow we go back and fight the devil probably going to have to fight him once we get out the doors of the church but father you give us equipment it's not anything we have to buy we don't have to go to publishers clearing house or any other place to buy these things you've equipped us lord with everything we need to get out of here father you've given us eternal life and our soul and lord i pray that you'll let that thing speak more than anything let it speak to the demons let it speak to whatever's bothering each individual whether it be your family lord your friends and anybody lord sickness disease and all these different things lord let that thing inside speak because without you lord we're nothing we have to depend on doctors and mechanics and all these different things that that we we're stuck in this three dimensions but lord we're not stuck in our soul our soul is eternal by the baptism of the holy ghost we should have a full direct line to you in any dimension you decide to be in and lord i pray that you'll touch us now lord give us lord's supernatural strength be your brother dale lord wednesday night as he comes to minister be with us during the week father bless the musicians the song leaders all the different ones that has a position and even the ones lord that fills the pew and says amen lord we pray that you just bless each one forgive us of our sins lord be with us give us your loving kindness lord we need it more than anything it's just maybe not we have to feel literally feel your presence but we know you're here we know you're here we know you've sent a prophet he's gone off the scene he's left us the word he's left it here that we can that we can hear it and lord i pray now that we'll let it not just be a thundering noise not let it just be words on a page but lord let it be our living reality in our heart father give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses bless each one on the highways lord as we come back together lord as one in you and on wednesday night lord be with each one forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes and faults we love you for all the many blessings that you've already given us lord and we pray that you just pile on more for us lord we ask these things in jesus name lord amen you're dismissed god bless you
