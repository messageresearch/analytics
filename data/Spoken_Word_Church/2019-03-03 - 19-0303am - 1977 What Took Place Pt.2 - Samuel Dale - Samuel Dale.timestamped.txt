[0:00] leviticus i want to make sure you
[0:03] follow me through the message to preach
[0:06] the last
[0:07] sunday there and i want you to you know
[0:11] if you have any questions and answers
[0:13] then we can handle that later or
[0:15] whatever
[0:16] but i want to make sure you understand
[0:19] what i'm saying
[0:20] whether you agree with it or whatever
[0:23] because it ain't up to me to reveal it
[0:25] i can't reveal it but if i can say what
[0:29] the prophet says then you've got to at
[0:30] least believe what he's saying
[0:33] see that's a very important thing
[0:35] because
[0:36] you know you say well well uh we don't
[0:39] believe the prophet said that well if
[0:41] when i read it to you
[0:43] you can't argue that point you know i
[0:46] mean that's that's a settled situation
[0:48] you know
[0:48] you can't argue that but just we'll
[0:50] we'll go back through that and
[0:52] try to cover some things uh brother dick
[0:54] called this morning and said he wasn't
[0:56] able to make it so be much in prayer for
[0:58] him
[1:00] and remember wade will be ministering
[1:02] the lord willing this coming wednesday
[1:05] but then remember he's leaving out
[1:07] thursday
[1:08] to go to the philippines and like i
[1:11] announced the other day if you have
[1:12] anything you'd like to give to him
[1:14] you know feel free to do so if you want
[1:17] to
[1:18] delete lisa and let her handle it every
[1:20] which way
[1:21] whatever but if you have something you'd
[1:23] like to give to him
[1:24] you know we pay the expense of the
[1:27] our trips and the stuff like that but we
[1:30] you know
[1:31] we uh leave the other uh but if you have
[1:34] anything you want to give make sure you
[1:35] do that
[1:36] okay all right um let's see what else
[1:41] two now after this evening service
[1:45] we'll have a little short period there
[1:48] because
[1:49] uh you know sometimes we leave things
[1:51] just kind of open
[1:52] and don't explain a lot of things so we
[1:55] want to go through just a little quick
[1:56] run through
[1:58] of the offices of the church and what's
[2:00] expected out of the officers and things
[2:03] we was going to do it yesterday but we
[2:06] decided to put it over let it be this
[2:08] afternoon
[2:09] and we can take care of that and cover
[2:11] all of the offices and what
[2:14] is the prophet has said about these you
[2:16] know for their doing
[2:17] all right now something else i forgot
[2:20] what it was
[2:21] um maybe i'll think of it a minute it
[2:23] will be for everybody so
[2:24] everybody's included right everybody
[2:26] stay
[2:28] and do it won't take but just a minute
[2:29] it's not just doing but two
[2:31] yeah uh we haven't had anybody to say
[2:34] yet they wasn't going to
[2:36] stay in their position office or
[2:38] whatever it is
[2:40] so then that's good but now if you do
[2:44] you know want to step down or whatever
[2:46] you want to do make sure you let us know
[2:48] where we can announce it this evening
[2:49] and cover things and try to get them
[2:51] covered
[2:52] but we appreciate that okay all right
[2:56] so let's just go into our scripture and
[2:58] i want to approach it little kind of
[3:00] backward
[3:01] way because uh i don't think
[3:04] that we we were doing it last night we
[3:07] had a real good time into
[3:09] bible study last night i thoroughly
[3:10] enjoyed it we were covering a lot of
[3:12] things
[3:14] uh you know that it didn't start that
[3:16] way we had
[3:18] brother ryan with about 10 questions
[3:21] short that we could answer and then
[3:24] we got into uh we started on something
[3:28] and it wound up the whole service we
[3:30] spent on one topic
[3:32] so if you want to listen to it uh feel
[3:35] free to do
[3:36] do so it'll be made for you we had a
[3:39] good time
[3:40] doing it but i'm saying that
[3:44] a lot of times sometimes you know
[3:45] sometimes i do especially i just say
[3:47] things
[3:48] expecting you to understand that
[3:53] but then to realize that uh you know
[3:56] sometimes you do say something and
[3:58] people hasn't read that
[4:00] or they haven't studied that point or
[4:02] line or thought
[4:04] and it leaves the mind kind of uh blank
[4:07] upon saying well
[4:08] well i didn't know it said that but if
[4:11] you just take the message the bible and
[4:13] let the prophet tell you what it is go
[4:15] read that scripture
[4:17] and read those things over and over
[4:19] until you see it
[4:20] and then you can can realize what's
[4:22] taking place so let's go to leviticus
[4:26] 25 because this will be where we'll be
[4:28] getting back to in the message in a
[4:29] minute
[4:30] and let's just read what the bible has
[4:33] to say because we're still on
[4:35] talking about the jubilee
[4:38] what did we find we'll read in a minute
[4:41] what did the prophet
[4:42] say he said i didn't know it
[4:45] until yesterday or today or something he
[4:47] said in
[4:48] 1977 is the jubilee
[4:52] well we're looking at a year it has
[4:55] nothing to do with a year except falling
[4:58] on that date
[4:59] or time he said it's a jubilee
[5:03] well why would we try to figure out how
[5:05] long this is how long that is what
[5:07] find out what it is
[5:10] you know and then we can see that it
[5:13] it will will open up our eyes to the
[5:16] truth
[5:17] all right and the lord speaking to moses
[5:19] in mount sinai
[5:20] saying speaking to the children of
[5:22] israel and say unto them
[5:24] when you come into the land which i give
[5:26] you
[5:27] then shall the land keep a sabbath unto
[5:30] the lord
[5:31] six years shalt thy soul thy field
[5:34] and six years shalt thou prune thy
[5:36] vineyard
[5:38] and gather in the fruit thereof now
[5:40] that's the land right
[5:42] all right but in the seventh year shall
[5:46] be
[5:46] a sabbath of rest unto the land
[5:50] a sabbath for the lord thou shalt
[5:55] thou shalt neither sow thy field nor
[5:58] prune thy vineyard in other words you've
[5:59] got to leave it lay it out
[6:01] okay but watch what you can do and can't
[6:03] do now
[6:04] that which groweth of its own accord of
[6:07] thy harvest
[6:08] thou shalt not reap now we're going to
[6:10] read about two more verses
[6:12] that you can't eat it but remember the
[6:15] word reap is to
[6:16] reap it to sail or to uh store up or
[6:20] to together is that point all right
[6:24] neither gather the grapes of thy
[6:26] vineyard undressed
[6:28] for it is year of rest un unto the land
[6:31] and the sabbath of the land shall be
[6:33] meat for you
[6:35] for thee and for thy servant and for thy
[6:37] maid
[6:38] in father hard servant and father for
[6:41] thy stranger that so journaleth with
[6:43] thee
[6:44] and for thy cattle and for the beasts
[6:47] that are in thy land
[6:49] shall all the increase thereof be meat
[6:52] all right so you can eat
[6:55] but you don't try to store up all right
[6:58] verse eight now
[7:00] thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[7:02] years unto thee
[7:04] seven times seven years and the space of
[7:08] the seven sabbaths of years
[7:10] shall be unto thee forty and nine years
[7:14] then thy shall cause the trumpet of the
[7:16] jubilee
[7:17] to sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[7:21] month and the day of atonement shall you
[7:24] make the trumpet sound
[7:25] throughout all your land now watch and
[7:28] you shall hallow the 50th year
[7:31] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[7:33] land
[7:34] unto all the inhabitants thereof and it
[7:37] shall be a
[7:38] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[7:41] every man
[7:42] unto his possession and you shall return
[7:44] every man
[7:46] unto his family now it's gone to the
[7:47] person first you're covering the land
[7:52] they were they would take and they would
[7:53] work six years
[7:55] and take a sabbatical as we call it
[7:57] every how you pronounce that big word
[7:59] they would take a year off the land laid
[8:01] out
[8:03] they didn't gather they didn't do but
[8:05] you could go in
[8:06] you could eat what was there you just
[8:09] couldn't
[8:11] take it and reap it and try to sell it
[8:13] or or
[8:14] to store it up and we'll you can go into
[8:17] the bible and say well how are you going
[8:19] to do that
[8:19] or he'll give you see
[8:23] that's why i say i get in the scripture
[8:24] then you've got to cover scripture that
[8:26] you don't intend to cover
[8:27] but in the bible see he gives you
[8:31] in the sixth double for the seventh
[8:34] right he gives you the increase god
[8:37] takes care of those things
[8:39] and makes it to work all right now and
[8:41] you shall hallow the 50th year and
[8:43] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[8:45] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[8:48] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[8:50] shall return every man
[8:51] unto his possession and you shall return
[8:53] every man
[8:54] unto his family a jubilee shall that
[8:58] fiftieth year
[9:00] be unto you and you shall not sow need a
[9:03] reap that which growth of it
[9:05] self in it or gather the grapes
[9:09] in it of thine of divine
[9:12] undressed for it is the jubilee it shall
[9:15] be holy unto you
[9:17] you shall eat the increase thereof i
[9:20] don't see what i'm saying
[9:22] you can eat the increase thereof but you
[9:24] don't store it up you don't do it
[9:26] and in the year of this jubilee
[9:30] you shall return every man unto his
[9:32] possession
[9:33] you may be seated the lord had his
[9:35] blessing to the
[9:36] reading of the word now i spent
[9:42] a lot of time there sunday
[9:45] covering some things to try to make a
[9:48] background
[9:50] to where that when you do read the
[9:52] scriptures that you
[9:54] you get your answer out of it all right
[9:58] now then as i tried to cover and i say
[10:02] this then i want to back up
[10:03] all right i tried to cover the point for
[10:06] you to see
[10:08] that it's not to look at dates and times
[10:11] and seasons
[10:12] although they have a meaning to things
[10:17] when world war one ended it was an 11th
[10:20] day 11th hour 11th year et cetera
[10:22] it meant something all right when
[10:27] it come to israel being established as a
[10:29] nation in 46
[10:31] it meant something it meant something
[10:33] that one did to israel
[10:35] because it was them to come back a
[10:37] nation but also means something to us
[10:39] because 46 was the year may the 6th was
[10:43] the
[10:44] year of establish or the date of the
[10:45] establishment of israel
[10:47] as a nation then the second the next day
[10:50] may the seventh then you have the
[10:53] prophet coming god meeting him
[10:55] sending him to the world with a message
[10:58] to the world all right now
[11:00] watch all that as it ties together in
[11:03] this when you sound the trumpet
[11:07] in in that year and you find a jubilee
[11:10] now
[11:10] as i told you if you look it up and you
[11:14] study it and you go into the bible and
[11:16] you say well i'm going to run in jubilee
[11:18] in my uh a study of the bible
[11:23] well you got to spell it correctly see
[11:26] we spell it j-u-b-i-l-e-e
[11:29] the bible spells it j-u-b-i-l-e
[11:33] you don't have the two e's you just have
[11:36] one but
[11:37] when we spell it we put two e's on it so
[11:40] if you're doing that
[11:41] i'm i do that to where somebody'll come
[11:43] along and say well we can't find the
[11:44] word jubilee
[11:46] the way you spelled it well all right
[11:48] that's the way it's spelled
[11:50] i do that to try to help you to
[11:52] understand
[11:53] all right but now let's approach this
[11:56] this way because
[11:58] we said we read there in leviticus that
[12:03] there was a jubilee and it's 7 times 7
[12:06] or the 49 was the time
[12:10] all right which is seven sabbaths
[12:13] you had a sabbath for the land and you
[12:15] got a sabbath for the people
[12:17] all right now when it come to that time
[12:20] there were special things took place
[12:22] when you say jubilee to most people they
[12:25] think 50.
[12:27] that's an automatic thought in your mind
[12:29] process
[12:30] is a 50. but you you don't you can't
[12:33] stay in the bible with that
[12:35] you got to get it correctly as to the
[12:38] numbers coming up
[12:40] before you can go to a 50
[12:43] you got to go to your sevens and seven
[12:46] sabas
[12:47] and get it lined up to where you got
[12:49] your rest correctly
[12:51] you got all of your things there's a
[12:53] jubilee in the bible
[12:56] there was a jubilee every seven years
[13:00] we think jubilees have said it's a 50.
[13:02] you had to go
[13:04] 7 times seven and then you go to your
[13:07] 50.
[13:08] all right and you line up things but you
[13:11] say well what need is to that
[13:12] it's very vital to me
[13:16] because it'll tie together all of the
[13:17] scriptures and if you can't tie together
[13:19] the scriptures
[13:20] see then you don't know what you're
[13:23] talking about that's just plain language
[13:25] all right well i well i just ain't got
[13:27] time to read you've got time to do
[13:29] everything else
[13:31] you know i mean if we're in school today
[13:33] and they assign a topic
[13:34] you're gonna have to answer questions
[13:36] next week you need to read what's
[13:38] assigned
[13:39] so i ask you to do that and then most of
[13:41] the time i just read all of it myself
[13:44] but i know how the mind works i don't
[13:47] know what this means to me
[13:48] well you don't even know what i'm saying
[13:51] i could ask you what did i just read i
[13:54] don't know
[13:56] but see that way you blame me for being
[13:59] too deep what's being deep when you can
[14:03] read
[14:03] like i told a man at work one time he
[14:05] said what are you trying to do i was
[14:07] showing the sabbath was a rest
[14:10] all right in the seventh and how it
[14:12] worked out
[14:13] and sunday was the first day of the week
[14:17] well see to him all he had was sabbath
[14:22] he couldn't understand he said what are
[14:24] you talking about
[14:25] what are you trying to prove i said i'm
[14:27] simply showing by the bible
[14:31] in the calendar
[14:35] that the whole original sabbath was
[14:37] saturday
[14:38] because it's the seventh day in the week
[14:43] sunday's the first day of the week
[14:47] and it says what i'm trying to show you
[14:48] the sabbath and the rest
[14:50] that goes with it well see that didn't
[14:52] mean a thing to him
[14:55] but that's in the old testament they had
[14:58] the sabbath as
[15:00] which is your seventh day of the week
[15:03] right you see we worship in honor we
[15:06] call we don't have no certain day to
[15:07] keep
[15:09] one over the other i'm quoting brother
[15:11] branham we worship
[15:12] on the first day of the week in honor of
[15:15] the resurrection
[15:16] because jesus raised the first day not
[15:19] the seventh day
[15:20] see we're still in those denominational
[15:22] ideas and you'd be surprised what they
[15:25] are
[15:26] a lot of people think jesus was
[15:27] crucified on wednesday
[15:29] raised up early or late saturday
[15:31] sometimes hung around all night long
[15:34] and then appeared to mary magdalene them
[15:36] on the first day of the week
[15:38] well you sure got a mix-up but that's
[15:42] why you don't
[15:43] follow the scriptures it plainly tells
[15:46] you
[15:48] jesus being risen
[15:51] early the first day of the week well
[15:54] then why don't we read it that way
[15:58] and see then that way that's where we
[15:59] miss all right but we're going to get to
[16:01] this in a minute
[16:02] where your prophet said
[16:06] that 1977
[16:10] is the jubilee
[16:15] well why don't we read that then why
[16:17] don't we believe it like that
[16:20] and that 1977 he said it's the 70th
[16:23] jubilee
[16:25] well you know exactly what jubilee is
[16:27] talking about
[16:28] from the beginning of jubilees in
[16:30] leviticus
[16:32] all right which is really your jubilees
[16:34] begin
[16:36] you go back i try to not to write so
[16:38] much in
[16:39] because it covers my but if you go back
[16:41] to abram
[16:43] abraham abram and you'll find that those
[16:47] things
[16:47] is laid in order to there in genesis
[16:51] 12 i think it is where you go back to
[16:54] the starting with
[16:55] with the time starting with abraham
[16:58] which was abram
[16:59] all right and that's where brother brown
[17:01] come up within 1954 years
[17:04] because he covered it from back there
[17:06] over to here to get his numbers
[17:08] correctly all right but now listen
[17:10] so listen to what i'm trying to say to
[17:12] you
[17:14] follow the point and listen there's a
[17:17] sabbath in the bible
[17:18] every seven years
[17:22] they had a sabbatical you worked
[17:25] six years you rested the seventh
[17:28] all right that was a sabbatical a time
[17:32] that you had a a year off of rest now
[17:35] that's in the bible so
[17:36] let's read those things and see but now
[17:39] remember
[17:40] now i'm going to give you one in a
[17:41] minute if you don't believe it
[17:44] brother branham says in the message
[17:45] feast of the trumpets
[17:47] how your seventh sabbath is for the
[17:50] seven church ages
[17:51] and he's right back before then he's
[17:53] covering how the
[17:55] there's a rest every seven years so
[17:58] we'll get to that in a minute all right
[17:59] just hold on
[18:00] don't say well i don't know where that
[18:02] just hold on we'll get to
[18:03] the minute where the prophet says that
[18:06] there's a rest every seven years
[18:09] all right but let's read the bible on it
[18:11] now
[18:13] but it's like i've told you we read for
[18:16] what we think
[18:17] and i know what brother branham has said
[18:19] i've read it over and over and over
[18:22] and talked trying to understand he talks
[18:26] about
[18:27] arrest he talks about it this way
[18:31] but then he lines it up in the
[18:32] scriptures all right
[18:34] and as he gets it lined up if we'll
[18:36] follow that
[18:38] it'll come out to right where we're at
[18:40] exactly to the understanding
[18:42] so now here we are we're in leviticus
[18:45] and we just read in leviticus so pull it
[18:48] back up now
[18:51] go back up where we was leviticus 25.
[18:55] all right to save reading we drop down
[18:58] to get it to where verse three six years
[19:01] shalt i sow thy field
[19:03] in six years shall i prune your vendored
[19:06] but in the seventh year you shall
[19:08] shall be of what a sabbath of rest
[19:12] unto the land a sabbath for the lord
[19:15] thou shalt not sow you know
[19:17] neither sow nor like into that because
[19:19] it's something happening every seven
[19:20] years
[19:21] seven years is a rest
[19:25] all right god worked six days
[19:29] right and rested the seventh
[19:35] now god in creation worked six days
[19:38] rested the seventh he as a type
[19:45] then jesus when he came in see look
[19:48] where he picked up because he was having
[19:49] to speak of what was coming
[19:51] he said come unto me all you that labor
[19:53] in heavy laden and i'll give you a
[19:55] sabbath
[19:56] i'll give you a rest speaking of the
[19:59] holy ghost that was to come
[20:02] all that old testament laid in order is
[20:05] a perfect type
[20:06] to be able to pull from it in the new
[20:08] testament see then jesus when he come
[20:11] into the new testament
[20:12] so you don't jump over and try to keep a
[20:14] day
[20:16] you get what it is not just a day
[20:21] jesus raised early the first day of the
[20:24] week
[20:26] all right would you go back to the one
[20:28] when you circle you you keep going
[20:30] all right to the number eight okay
[20:34] now but when he was here
[20:37] the holy ghost eternal life was inside
[20:39] of him
[20:41] but he's saying if you come to me and
[20:42] all you labor in heaven i'll give you my
[20:44] rest
[20:46] not just a sabbath of the old testament
[20:49] but a rest but all of that spoke of
[20:54] if you read something on that order you
[20:56] get a whole lot better picture
[20:57] all of those things spoke of the new
[21:00] testament
[21:02] see why would they have
[21:05] a sabbath why would god put it in the
[21:08] scripture
[21:09] like he did here in leviticus that you
[21:11] work six years and rest the seventh why
[21:16] would he put it in the scriptures to
[21:17] work six days
[21:18] and rest the seventh
[21:23] you don't think about well why did he do
[21:25] that he done that to where
[21:27] there would be a type of the new birth
[21:29] to come on over
[21:30] in the new testament to an eternal
[21:33] sabbath
[21:35] all right see you'd come to an
[21:37] understanding
[21:38] of why then that you know jesus raised
[21:42] the first day of the week
[21:45] he didn't raise the sabbath the old rest
[21:47] day
[21:49] he raised the first day of the week
[21:52] which is eternal life it's the eighth
[21:55] day
[21:56] all right so now listen to what we're
[21:58] saying all right
[22:00] so we're reading it and what does it say
[22:02] now
[22:04] pull it back up and let's just go on
[22:06] down
[22:09] go to verse 6 and the sabbath of the
[22:11] land shall be meat to you
[22:14] for thy servant for thy mate and for the
[22:17] hard servant
[22:18] so you can even make you couldn't even
[22:20] make the people that work for you
[22:22] they got a sabbatical too
[22:25] everybody got a sabbatical everybody got
[22:28] a rest
[22:30] everybody would work six days rest to
[22:32] seven
[22:33] and god would always give on the sixth
[22:36] double portion
[22:37] where it will carry through so you can
[22:39] come on over to your
[22:41] past the sabbath you didn't have to get
[22:43] up and do it
[22:44] all right the land it would go through
[22:46] but then you could go out in the land
[22:48] and you could take your stuff and eat it
[22:51] but you didn't try to preserve it or
[22:52] keep it or anything
[22:54] because god gave you the double you're
[22:56] supposed to do that in the sixth
[22:58] make everything ready for the seventh
[23:01] everything run like that
[23:02] you say well did they go through that
[23:04] they went through that every day
[23:07] every day they had to count to days to
[23:10] wind up and see what sabbath
[23:13] then a lot of times they would have
[23:14] double sabbaths
[23:17] ain't going to get into that but a lot
[23:19] of times they was and they'd have
[23:21] two like things happen all right you'd
[23:23] have to cover what's taking place
[23:26] okay but see numbers mean something
[23:29] to god it meant something to the prophet
[23:33] when the bible says when the day of
[23:34] pentecost was fully come
[23:39] then the holy ghost failed right it
[23:42] didn't fall on the third
[23:44] fourth fifth or sixth it even didn't
[23:47] even fall on the seventh
[23:50] it fell on eternity which is christ
[23:54] all right now so watch now
[23:58] verse nine or verse eight because this
[24:01] is where we'll get the point
[24:02] in a little bit thou shalt number seven
[24:05] sabbaths of years unto thee
[24:07] seven times seven years and the space of
[24:10] the seven sabbaths of years shall be
[24:12] unto thee
[24:13] forty and nine years okay now you're
[24:16] going to have a
[24:17] a sabbatical a rest every seven years
[24:22] okay now it's got to tie with the rest
[24:25] of the bible and keep it going all right
[24:27] so let's jump over now
[24:30] let's go to exodus
[24:34] you can keep reading in leviticus and
[24:36] read it when you get time
[24:38] but let's go to exodus
[24:41] now these are the judgments which thou
[24:43] shall set before them if thy by
[24:46] an hebrew servant six years shall he
[24:49] serve
[24:50] and the seventh he shall go out free for
[24:53] nothing
[24:55] all right so rest is gonna come
[24:58] every seven years okay
[25:03] we'll read it a little bit where the
[25:04] prophet said he goes out totally free he
[25:06] don't
[25:06] owe nobody nothing but that's where that
[25:09] we don't
[25:10] follow we think we've got something
[25:12] because we got a word or a thought
[25:16] there is no slavery to that
[25:21] but brother branham will call it a slave
[25:23] sold in the market
[25:24] remember a slave sold in the market he
[25:27] didn't go free after six years
[25:29] you see yeah the bible said everything
[25:31] goes
[25:32] well he's a slave
[25:36] the guy that gets bored near sure don't
[25:38] go free
[25:40] right he stays a slave to the master
[25:43] rest of his life
[25:44] but get all of that to a lie and the
[25:46] brother brandon will use the word slave
[25:49] and talk about it being a slave
[25:53] but read your bible and listen to what
[25:55] then he says
[25:57] he said a true born israelite
[26:03] now i'll read that to you in a minute a
[26:04] true born to israelite
[26:08] ain't talking about this to anybody
[26:10] because i told you the children of
[26:12] israel had slaves
[26:19] you you don't follow to line up with the
[26:22] scriptures
[26:23] and then you get all muddled up and well
[26:25] i don't understand what that means
[26:27] brother dale seems to be so happy about
[26:29] this and i don't know what in the world
[26:31] he's saying
[26:32] well why don't you read your bible
[26:38] i thought that's what we're supposed to
[26:40] read
[26:43] but how many of you get your bible down
[26:45] and read when somebody gives you a
[26:46] topic or a thought how many of you go
[26:49] home and read it
[26:50] how many of you listen to the services
[26:52] when you miss
[27:01] well i just don't understand brother
[27:03] dale he's been on that for four weeks
[27:04] now
[27:06] if you'd been here and listen at least
[27:09] you'd know
[27:10] mentally in your mind right
[27:13] it's up to god to do the revealing okay
[27:15] be sorry i'm just sorry to try to
[27:18] say things but then when i try to say it
[27:20] i look at faisal
[27:22] i don't have to understand that
[27:28] i'll give you the pulpit how did brother
[27:31] branham come
[27:32] up with a jubilee
[27:36] of 1977
[27:40] if he hadn't been studying the bible
[27:48] well god just spoke to him now he said i
[27:51] didn't know
[27:54] this until just the other day so we'll
[27:57] get to it but look
[28:00] now these are the judgments which i
[28:02] shall set before them
[28:04] if thy by an hebrew servant six years
[28:07] shall he serve
[28:09] and in the seventh he shall go out free
[28:11] for nothing
[28:13] six years because the seventh is the
[28:15] release
[28:16] the word jubilee is the same word as
[28:19] release
[28:21] listen if you just listen without
[28:24] figuring it all out
[28:26] when i finish this up maybe it'll be
[28:28] next sunday
[28:29] i hope to the lord willing that you can
[28:31] get out of the old testament and get
[28:33] into the new testament
[28:35] and find out that when that jubilee
[28:38] sounds
[28:40] it's the same thing as
[28:44] first thessalonians
[28:48] and it's the same thing as corinthians
[28:51] that says at the last trump for the
[28:54] trumpet shall sound
[28:58] and thessalonians says the lord himself
[29:00] descended with a shout that's the same
[29:02] word
[29:03] as jubilee in the old testament i've
[29:05] preached these for 40 years
[29:08] where have you been
[29:12] that jubilee is the same word as shout
[29:15] out
[29:20] but we we'd like to have things that
[29:22] make us interesting
[29:23] why don't you get interested in the word
[29:27] i ain't got time okay you argue with god
[29:31] about whether you've got time
[29:32] according to brother branham uh john
[29:34] wesley's mother and they had
[29:36] how many kids to have 13 or 16. 13 or 16
[29:39] kids
[29:40] and she had an hour a day to at least
[29:42] take her with him
[29:48] okay now watch look how beautiful
[29:52] the scripture says it it tells you right
[29:55] to the t what you need to know
[29:58] if thy by a hebrew servant six years he
[30:01] shall serve
[30:03] and in the seventh he shall go out free
[30:06] for
[30:06] nothing amen
[30:10] it don't matter what he owes so what is
[30:13] it when you're doing that way
[30:15] i was explaining brother colley
[30:18] i sell i i'll get on debt to brother
[30:20] colley
[30:22] you know all right i go to him and say i
[30:24] can't pay that debt
[30:27] i'll go in bondage to you for six years
[30:34] well now i'm like oh we got a scripture
[30:37] down in here in a minute it's going to
[30:38] slap you in the face with all this
[30:40] but i i don't know whether i wanted to
[30:42] work how long do you think he's got to
[30:44] work six years to pay me so and so on so
[30:46] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[30:50] you don't turn down that man that's
[30:53] asking for
[30:54] money even though he owes you a million
[30:56] and the other guy owes you two dollars
[30:58] you treat him the same cause it's a
[31:02] brother
[31:06] we're going to read it you don't send a
[31:09] man out empty-handed
[31:14] even though he's owes you and come into
[31:17] bondage to you
[31:19] and you work six years you give him
[31:21] enough to be able to get started
[31:24] well what do you mean i ain't getting
[31:25] that's the old jew
[31:28] you're gonna find out one of these days
[31:29] why
[31:31] the 50 never was kept right
[31:36] it never was honored
[31:40] by the jews they didn't even honor the
[31:43] seven but they had to honor some
[31:45] because they say that's god's doing now
[31:47] look
[31:48] look what happens to
[31:53] if he came in by himself
[31:56] i go to brother colley i owe him money i
[31:59] can't pay him
[32:00] i said brother call that work for you
[32:01] six years
[32:05] well you owe too much for me to work six
[32:07] years you're going brothers
[32:09] that ain't a brother i'm trying to get
[32:11] you to see something for once in your
[32:13] life when the bible speaks of a brother
[32:15] it speaks of a brother
[32:18] the bible says that you do this
[32:22] to where there won't be no poor
[32:25] in israel
[32:31] it's got a reason for all the doing you
[32:34] can't turn the man down
[32:36] it ain't a slave to go and sell out
[32:40] it's if i owe my brother i could work
[32:43] for him six years
[32:46] then the seventh i go free
[32:49] now watch what it says if he came in by
[32:54] himself
[32:56] he shall go out by himself
[32:59] if he were married then his wife shall
[33:02] go out with him
[33:05] now this is under a seven so watch what
[33:07] it's saying
[33:13] if he came in by himself he goes out by
[33:15] if we're married his wife go
[33:17] and if his master hath give him a wife
[33:20] and she have borne him sons or daughters
[33:23] the
[33:24] wife and the children shall be her
[33:25] masters
[33:27] and he shall go out by himself
[33:32] do you understand what that's doing if i
[33:35] go in bondage to brother colley
[33:38] six years if i come in with a wife
[33:42] we go out cause that's a brother
[33:46] but if not and he gives me a wife at the
[33:48] end of the six years
[33:49] she don't go free
[33:54] because see now you're going to say well
[33:56] how did you get that well listen
[33:58] because there's no rapture in any church
[34:02] age
[34:02] and this seven sabbath represents i'll
[34:05] read your prophets saying it
[34:07] represents the seven church ages
[34:12] it was limitations in the church ages
[34:15] right
[34:17] every church age wasn't even engaged the
[34:20] same
[34:20] there's limitations there's no rapture
[34:24] the church ages had the new birth yes
[34:28] but other things bound them look what
[34:29] it's saying if his master gave him a
[34:32] wife and she
[34:33] more sons and daughters he goes out and
[34:36] his wife don't if the servant shall
[34:37] plainly say
[34:39] see we want to lay on to that most of
[34:40] the time don't even read these others
[34:43] and if the servant shall plainly say i
[34:45] love my master my wife and my children i
[34:48] will not go out what do you do take him
[34:49] down boy
[34:50] in the ear is that what it says and his
[34:53] master shall bring him unto the judges
[34:55] and he shall bring him to the door or
[34:58] into the doorpost
[35:00] and his master shall bore his hear
[35:02] through
[35:03] will and all and he shall serve him
[35:05] forever
[35:07] that's the one we deal with we don't
[35:09] think about
[35:11] if you go into bondage with a wife well
[35:13] i don't know what that would mean
[35:15] follow the thought
[35:19] follow the thought of the church ages
[35:23] every one of those ages is in the ground
[35:26] i don't care how much they had of the
[35:28] word
[35:29] they're in the ground waiting on
[35:32] us
[35:36] to get them out of the ground well
[35:39] because that's a hebrew
[35:40] buying hebrew okay there's exodus saying
[35:44] it if a hebrew buys a hebrew okay go
[35:47] ahead to deuteronomy
[35:48] 15.
[35:52] due to running 15. at the end of every
[35:56] seven years
[35:57] thou shalt make a release
[36:00] and this is the manner of the release
[36:03] every creditor that lendeth
[36:05] ought unto his neighbor shall release it
[36:08] he shall not exact it of his neighbor or
[36:12] his brother in other words he can't
[36:13] keep it and just throw the guy out
[36:17] you know comes up to the ends i said to
[36:18] brother colley and i go to him and i
[36:20] said well
[36:21] i'm fir tomorrow's my last day brother
[36:24] oh you know and i'm going to be leaving
[36:28] well get out no he's going to say
[36:32] what do you need what do you need to
[36:36] help you get started
[36:38] and he's going to give it to me that's a
[36:40] brother to a brother
[36:44] that was old testament see
[36:48] every creditor that lendeth all unto his
[36:50] neighbor
[36:51] shall release it he shall not exact it
[36:54] of his neighbor
[36:55] or of his brother because it's called
[36:56] the lord's release
[37:00] it ain't me paying brother colley
[37:04] it's god paying brother cawley because
[37:07] he rewards him
[37:08] for what he does for me right
[37:12] or foreigners i must exact it again see
[37:15] how specific to scripture in other words
[37:17] if you've got your own slave he don't
[37:18] have to go free
[37:21] you are a foreigner you don't have to be
[37:22] released
[37:24] because you're dealing with a hebrew to
[37:25] a hebrew or a brother to a brother
[37:29] that's type salvation or a foreigner and
[37:32] a mass
[37:33] thou must exact it again because you
[37:36] tell him hey you pay me but
[37:38] with that which is done with thy brother
[37:42] thy hand shall release
[37:46] if it's a brother you've got to release
[37:47] it now watch
[37:50] save now look how specific the scripture
[37:52] is
[37:53] then we're going to read one down here
[37:54] it says it'll never be that they'll
[37:56] that is you know they'll never be that
[37:57] the poor's the poor is going to be with
[37:59] us always
[38:00] but look save in other words it might be
[38:03] a case come up
[38:05] when there shall be no poor among you
[38:09] if there's no poor among you you don't
[38:12] have to do a lot of the things
[38:15] right that's god's doing now watch what
[38:18] he says
[38:20] for the lord shall greatly bless thee in
[38:23] the land which thy lord the
[38:25] which the lord thy god giveth thee for
[38:27] an inheritance
[38:28] to possess it
[38:34] what happened to who was it back in the
[38:38] old testament
[38:41] jacob and his wives
[38:46] he worked for laban
[38:49] right he's supposed to go free spoofs
[38:52] let him help that wife
[38:54] he tricked him give him another one but
[38:56] then he turns around works seven more
[38:57] goes back to that
[38:59] now i've always said you can argue with
[39:02] me about things but let's put it in
[39:03] scripture spiritually
[39:06] did jacob have to wait 14 years to get
[39:12] rachel
[39:14] he worked six years seven
[39:20] and he done all it was to do for his
[39:23] wife leah
[39:25] her time her doings
[39:29] as a wife he had to stay with her for so
[39:31] long
[39:34] according to the bible really you
[39:36] wouldn't suppose man was supposed to go
[39:37] to war for a year and all that
[39:39] see i don't know what to lend the time
[39:40] that he was
[39:42] but what would be wrong with would take
[39:44] with jacob taking
[39:47] rachel
[39:50] before the 14 years was up
[39:54] this is salvation this is not just
[39:57] dealing with dates and times and farts
[39:59] and thoughts
[40:00] like i just read you i go into bondage
[40:03] to brother collie
[40:04] he's my brother when he gets ready for
[40:08] me to go home
[40:09] i'm not going to be a lazy bum for the
[40:11] six years i work
[40:14] because i'm working for my brother i'm
[40:16] going to do everything i can to help him
[40:18] and god's going to bless did we read it
[40:20] because god will bless
[40:22] god's going to bless and brother
[40:23] callie's going to gain ground from
[40:25] all he's going to do is just say brother
[40:28] take what you need
[40:32] just take what you need whatever you
[40:34] need to get started again
[40:37] take it and let's go because he's my
[40:39] brother
[40:41] salvation is involved in the whole thing
[40:44] what
[40:45] save when there shall be no poor among
[40:47] you for the lord shall greatly bless
[40:49] now look only if thou carefully hearken
[40:52] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[40:54] to observe to do all these commandments
[40:56] which i command thee
[40:59] for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he
[41:02] promised thee
[41:03] and thou shalt lend unto many nations
[41:10] but thy shall not borrow you don't
[41:13] borrow from the nations
[41:15] but you can lend thou shalt reign over
[41:18] many nations
[41:19] but they shall not reign over thee
[41:22] now watch it if there be among you a
[41:25] poor man
[41:26] of one of thy brethren with any of thy
[41:29] gates
[41:30] in thy land which the lord thy god
[41:32] giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine
[41:34] heart
[41:36] nor shut thine hand
[41:40] from thy poor brother
[41:44] now that's a commandment you see why
[41:46] israel is so condemned
[41:48] they never done that
[41:52] they never put their brother first they
[41:55] extracted
[41:56] god open that hand wide unto him then
[42:00] thy shall surely let him lead him
[42:02] sufficient for his needs
[42:04] in that which he wanteth
[42:08] you give him the brother goes home you
[42:11] give him
[42:12] something now watch
[42:15] beware what's israel and how god curses
[42:18] them
[42:19] because they don't keep the 50th come on
[42:22] beware that there be not a thought
[42:26] in thy wicked heart
[42:31] saying the seventh year the year of
[42:34] release is at hand
[42:36] and then i shall be evil against thy
[42:39] poor brother
[42:42] and thy give us him nothing and he
[42:44] crying to the lord against thee
[42:46] and it be sin unto thee
[42:51] are you reading the bible
[42:56] the israel's got the wicked heart they
[42:57] ain't never let nobody go free
[42:59] they ain't going to do it so they're
[43:02] keeping
[43:03] their sin and holding them come on read
[43:06] it
[43:07] if your brother thou shalt surely give
[43:09] him and thy heart shall not be grieved
[43:12] when thou give us unto him well i would
[43:14] give you
[43:16] i would give you provisions for a week
[43:18] but i think you can get by with two days
[43:20] i'm just i'm not going to give you but
[43:22] two days that's a wicked heart
[43:24] you give him whatever he needs and tell
[43:27] him if he needs some more to come back
[43:28] and you'll give him some more
[43:29] that's a brother to a brother i'm
[43:32] talking about salvation whether you
[43:33] believe it or not
[43:34] simply preaching salvation but i'm so
[43:37] deep you can't understand what i'm
[43:38] trying to say
[43:40] salvation was dire
[43:44] look that's what surely give him and
[43:47] thine heart shall not be grieved
[43:49] when thou giveth unto him because that
[43:52] for this thing
[43:53] the lord thy god shall bless thee in all
[43:56] thy works and in
[43:57] all that thou putteth thy hand unto
[44:00] for the poor shall never cease out of
[44:03] the land
[44:05] now he's a toad up there if it's a time
[44:08] that it happens to be
[44:10] that there's no poor you don't have to
[44:12] abide by all of the laws of giving and
[44:14] doing
[44:15] if there's no poor but now he's telling
[44:18] ain't gonna never be that way
[44:20] for the poor she'll never cease out of
[44:21] the land therefore i command thee saying
[44:24] thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
[44:27] brother
[44:28] and unto unto thy brother to thy poor
[44:31] and to thy needy in the land and if thy
[44:34] brother and hebrew
[44:36] or a hebrew woman be sold
[44:39] unto thee he shall serve these six ears
[44:43] then in the seventh thou shall let him
[44:45] go free from thee
[44:48] and when thou send us him out free from
[44:50] thee
[44:51] thou shalt not let him go away empty
[44:55] are you following what i just preached
[44:59] thou shalt not thou shalt furnish him
[45:01] liberty
[45:03] out of thy flock and out of thy floor
[45:07] and out of that wine press
[45:10] of that wherewith the lord thy god hath
[45:13] blessed
[45:13] thee thou shalt give unto him why
[45:19] and thou shalt remember that thou was
[45:22] the bondman
[45:24] in the land of egypt and the lord god
[45:27] thy god redeemed thee
[45:28] therefore i command thee this this
[45:32] thing today and it shall be if he say
[45:35] unto thee
[45:37] i will not go away from thee because he
[45:40] loveth thee in thine house because
[45:42] he is well with thee then thou shalt
[45:44] take him in
[45:45] bore him in the ear he becomes his life
[45:49] so the bible keeps laying down in order
[45:52] what you're looking at
[45:53] okay okay
[45:58] let's go to what we got left
[46:04] all right so you see
[46:08] there's a release every seven years
[46:12] and that's what it speaks of back there
[46:15] that they had a rest
[46:16] every seventh year they had a rest every
[46:19] seventh day
[46:21] that was the type that jesus could say
[46:23] come unto me all you that labor in
[46:25] heaven
[46:25] and i'll give you eternal rest
[46:29] all that just typed it so if you don't
[46:31] keep your types right
[46:33] how are you going to do anything else
[46:38] you keep your types in order you'll come
[46:40] out to your antitype
[46:43] the fulfillment because if you don't
[46:47] all right so remember we're talking
[46:48] about salvation
[46:51] well brother dale's salvation to me i
[46:53] come into all and repent of my sins and
[46:55] i asked the lord to forgive me
[46:59] that's what all of that's talking about
[47:03] that's what all that old testament is
[47:05] talking about
[47:08] is a way of salvation jesus when he came
[47:12] took it from honoring the seventh
[47:16] the rest he honored them himself he kept
[47:19] him himself
[47:21] then he spoke of a day to come
[47:25] which would be salvation finished but
[47:28] you know what that old testament under
[47:30] the sevens
[47:31] and the release that i just read that's
[47:34] their
[47:35] jubilee that's their release
[47:39] that's what's all that's what it's all
[47:40] about
[47:42] that's why you got to read all of that
[47:46] and know what it's saying well i don't
[47:48] know where
[47:49] okay go ahead at number six and let's
[47:52] read this
[47:54] let's let the prophet answer the
[47:56] question if you say well i don't know
[47:58] about this
[47:59] seven year release
[48:02] jubilee year paragraph 49. now jesus was
[48:06] prophesied by the
[48:07] isaiah to preach the acceptable year
[48:09] that's what we want to deal with on
[48:11] tonight
[48:12] now the acceptable year was this
[48:16] that enduring the time in other words
[48:20] back there
[48:23] okay come on back there in the old
[48:25] testament
[48:26] in the time because uh between so many
[48:29] years
[48:30] acceptable year is the year called in
[48:32] the old writings
[48:34] the year of jubilee they come i believe
[48:36] it was either
[48:38] every seven years was a jubilee
[48:41] year so now all that i've said you see
[48:45] why
[48:45] that i cut off sunday because i just
[48:47] said
[48:49] you got to release every seven years in
[48:50] the bible how many of you went home to
[48:53] look that up to see if that release was
[48:54] correct
[48:56] or how many of you've ever read exodus
[49:00] deuteronomy
[49:02] and all of these scriptures if you read
[49:05] them real slow you get a beautiful thing
[49:10] what we were doing there last night you
[49:12] take the combat beast
[49:16] the combat beast in the book of
[49:17] revelation
[49:19] the man the ox blind the eagle turned
[49:22] right around and put them in the old
[49:23] testament
[49:25] and then israel camped they count
[49:30] three tribes three tribes
[49:33] three tribes and three tribes
[49:39] how many of you know that it was
[49:42] originally to have been
[49:43] 13 tribes
[49:47] there was 13 tribes in the beginning
[49:51] when israel was in her travel journey
[49:53] there was 13
[49:54] tribes go to the church age book i'll
[49:58] give you the page number your prophet
[50:00] says it
[50:01] because the levite never had anything he
[50:04] didn't have no land no inheritance or
[50:06] nothing
[50:07] he was sitting in the middle the levite
[50:11] was where the ark of the covenant was at
[50:13] and like wade was talking about it i've
[50:15] used dan but it was judah
[50:17] let's see how do you get 78 can't
[50:18] remember to get all them day but
[50:20] i used to preach on this 30 40 years ago
[50:22] really enjoyed it
[50:24] you realize that they count that away
[50:26] they count three three three and three
[50:28] and there was the priest and the word
[50:30] right in the middle
[50:32] they were guarding that when they got
[50:34] ready to leave judah went out first
[50:36] two more tribes went with him here comes
[50:39] the next one i don't know what the next
[50:41] one was
[50:41] it comes out and in other words six
[50:45] thousand of them
[50:46] they have a yes six thousand and then
[50:49] here goes the word
[50:52] and then there's two more groups
[50:55] following that word
[50:56] that word's protected that levite never
[51:00] had an inheritance
[51:02] but because of dan and ephraim if you
[51:04] read your bible
[51:06] dan and ephraim sinned and when they're
[51:09] dead their name was taken out
[51:11] under heaven didn't say
[51:15] in heaven it says under heaven dan and
[51:22] ephraim is put back in in the millennium
[51:24] because heaven starts ruling over earth
[51:26] again and dan and ephraim is put back in
[51:29] and joseph and minas was taken out and
[51:30] levi put right back in the middle and
[51:32] you got your 13th drive
[51:35] but if you don't read the bible
[51:38] then somebody says i don't know whether
[51:40] that's in the bible or not
[51:42] i ain't never heard nothing like that
[51:44] well i i've
[51:45] i get it out of the bible
[51:51] what i just quoted to you is out of the
[51:53] bible there was no inheritance father
[51:55] levi
[51:56] levi said to god you know where's mine
[51:59] in other words god said i'm your
[52:01] inheritance
[52:02] oh i love brother random when he said
[52:04] look out there seen them great big
[52:05] buildings
[52:06] great big buildings great big things at
[52:08] holly and he said god
[52:10] where's mine he said i'm your portion
[52:14] i'm your portion
[52:17] come on church
[52:21] acceptable year every seven years
[52:26] they let the ground rest
[52:30] they growed no fruit
[52:34] on it or no planted
[52:38] they didn't plant all right
[52:42] they let their crops in the fields rest
[52:45] every seven years
[52:47] at that time was a jubilee
[52:50] a sabbatical a jubilee
[52:54] the priest wrote through the land
[52:56] sounding the trumpet
[52:58] we'll read what the prophet says the
[53:01] priests
[53:02] sounded the trumpet to announce the
[53:04] jubilee because it had to fall
[53:06] if you was listening to leviticus 25
[53:10] 8 when was reading there it tells you
[53:12] the exact date that it has to be done
[53:16] it's on the 10th day of the month of
[53:18] october
[53:22] which is the atonement all the dates has
[53:26] got to be right
[53:29] but we don't read it for that well i
[53:30] don't need to read that you don't even
[53:32] know
[53:32] you don't need to read about the
[53:33] atonement
[53:37] okay go ahead we're still in in the
[53:42] message jubilee here
[53:43] go ahead now the same thing was in the
[53:46] days of the lord
[53:47] when they took a slave and sold it then
[53:50] every seven years there was a jubilee
[53:53] year come by and this was a great time
[53:56] and it has a great significance to the
[53:59] people of today
[54:03] oh
[54:08] that release has a significance or a
[54:10] meaning
[54:11] to you and i today just like it had a
[54:14] meaning
[54:14] for 46 for israel to be established as a
[54:18] nation
[54:19] the next day god sent a prophet to the
[54:22] world with a message
[54:24] that had a meaning that had a meaning
[54:28] when 11 11 falls
[54:30] on the 11th our people
[54:35] right that had a meaning of what 77 is
[54:40] then there were seven years i shall be a
[54:41] jubilee year come by
[54:44] it was a great time and has a great
[54:46] significance to the people of today
[54:48] wrote it on but then every seven years
[54:52] it was the law of god
[54:54] that there was a jubilee year you don't
[54:56] wait to your 50s you got to get your 49s
[54:59] in the old testament
[55:00] then you go to 50s will cover and carry
[55:03] you into the new testament
[55:06] because the old testament will end when
[55:09] jesus was crucified
[55:11] and raised the first day of the week
[55:13] that ended that
[55:14] old testament seven seven seven sevens
[55:20] it wound up to be an 8 which would be no
[55:23] numbers whatsoever
[55:25] so it would go into eternity
[55:30] right look
[55:35] but then every seven years it was the
[55:36] law of god that there was a jubilee year
[55:41] and when this jubilee year come by then
[55:43] the priests rode the land
[55:46] now if we don't get there you just
[55:48] remember this prophet went around the
[55:50] world
[55:51] don't forget that one okay
[55:55] sounding the trumpet the lord himself
[55:58] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[56:00] trumpet and every slave that had been
[56:03] bought with a price and become a servant
[56:05] was given the privilege to be free go
[56:07] back home again
[56:08] back to his loved ones he was redeemed
[56:11] by back by grace he didn't have to pay
[56:14] anything
[56:16] his loved ones didn't have to pay
[56:17] anything it was an act of god
[56:20] what a beautiful illustration
[56:26] going to the next one number eight
[56:31] are you getting the point the point is
[56:34] the prophet is saying every seven years
[56:37] is a release are you getting that point
[56:39] that's what i mean that's what i'm
[56:41] covering that every seven years was a
[56:43] release
[56:46] then we'll get to the 50.
[56:50] but we've got to go through the sevens
[56:54] all right this is still in a returning
[56:55] jubilee now if somehow
[56:57] or other the individual lost their
[57:00] inheritance
[57:01] that was given to them by god there come
[57:04] a year called the jubilee year
[57:07] and that was ever seven years they had a
[57:11] rest
[57:12] a sabbath every seven days
[57:15] they had a sabbath every seven years
[57:18] they had a sabbath
[57:19] and seventh sabbath was 49 years what
[57:23] 1770 and the 50th year was the jubilee
[57:28] that's exactly right but get your sevens
[57:31] right first
[57:34] and in this jubilee every man that had
[57:35] lost his inheritance by some means
[57:38] if he was a freeborn then it was
[57:42] it was freeborn and a true blooded
[57:44] israelites
[57:46] now that ain't talking about slaves that
[57:48] you buy and try to sail
[57:53] the prophet uses slavery because that's
[57:54] the terminologies of the of our lives
[57:58] yours he's not using slavery what's he
[58:01] using
[58:02] in his jubilee man that had lost his
[58:04] inheritance by some means
[58:06] if he was a freeborn and a true blooded
[58:09] israelite
[58:10] no matter who held the possession it had
[58:13] to go back to him free
[58:15] he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't
[58:17] have to do a thing
[58:18] just stop what he was doing and go back
[58:21] to his inheritance
[58:25] that was every seven years
[58:29] now if that could be so wonderful to be
[58:31] that way what is the jubilee
[58:33] of the fifty
[58:38] what are you listening they had a
[58:42] jubilee
[58:43] every seven years in the old testament
[58:47] right we gave you
[58:50] exodus deuteronomy
[58:54] we gave you the prophet covering this
[58:56] now let's take a step forward
[59:00] let's just move up a step and watch all
[59:04] of these fall into place
[59:06] because all of that's tops and shadows
[59:08] go to the next one
[59:10] which is the feast of the trumpets
[59:14] and seven sabbaths is the seven church
[59:17] years
[59:18] church ages he's blinded waiting all the
[59:21] time on pentecost the first one
[59:23] seven church ages being seven sabbaths
[59:27] so every time they had a church every
[59:29] time they had a sabbath
[59:30] it was a type in the church ages
[59:33] because it's 49 years right
[59:38] 49 7 7's is 49.
[59:42] all right listen what he's saying
[59:44] exactly seven sabbaths from the
[59:46] pentecostal jubilee trumpet
[59:48] a pentecostal jubilee
[59:52] a pentecostal jubilee feast unto the
[59:54] waving of the sheaf
[59:55] and the pentecostal jubilee and then
[59:58] from the jubilee to the atonement of
[59:59] seven sabbaths
[1:00:00] fifty days and at the end of the fifty
[1:00:03] days as the atonement is made
[1:00:04] you get it and this has been a type at
[1:00:07] the church
[1:00:10] those seven sabbaths back there when we
[1:00:12] read in leviticus
[1:00:14] 25 8 that you'd multiply 7 times 7
[1:00:21] would come up with 49 years the 49 years
[1:00:24] of leviticus and the 49 of deuteron all
[1:00:27] of them the years are coming
[1:00:29] naturally would be a type of the seven
[1:00:31] church ages
[1:00:34] all right in the seven church ages
[1:00:38] you had a release every seven years
[1:00:42] i'm not talking about church ages laying
[1:00:43] out with a seven year thing
[1:00:45] you get what i'm saying it wasn't just
[1:00:48] seven years it was hundreds of years
[1:00:50] but each church age represented a
[1:00:53] release
[1:00:54] because the people were released from
[1:00:56] satan's bondage
[1:00:57] in each church age each church age had
[1:00:59] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:01] the new birth they had went from the
[1:01:04] natural rest
[1:01:06] of the sabbath to the spiritual rest of
[1:01:08] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:13] the new birth right all right
[1:01:16] what'd it turn out to be then
[1:01:22] brother branham what is 1977
[1:01:27] why would you use that
[1:01:32] we can understand why he used 11-11
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:36] we can understand why use uh
[1:01:39] uh 46
[1:01:42] we'd understand those things
[1:01:45] but can we understand what is 1977.
[1:01:51] oh it was a year that the prophet said i
[1:01:54] read you them
[1:01:55] over and over and over i got two to just
[1:01:57] put them on your
[1:01:58] but i read you like sunday over and over
[1:02:01] where the prophet said
[1:02:02] i do not say god told me 77
[1:02:06] said if they say that the 77 was to be
[1:02:10] the coming of the lord
[1:02:11] he said they're wrong
[1:02:14] he said i predicted there's not a
[1:02:18] statement of 77 other than with the
[1:02:20] predictions
[1:02:21] or that i can find now
[1:02:24] other than the predictions and the
[1:02:27] saying the lord didn't tell me
[1:02:29] and he said it's not a prophecy
[1:02:33] come on church in the 60s late 60s and
[1:02:36] early 70s
[1:02:37] we set for hours for preachers to preach
[1:02:39] about
[1:02:40] a prediction as a thus saith the lord
[1:02:43] and if we pass 73 and a half we're going
[1:02:46] to be lost
[1:02:51] some of you didn't raise up into that
[1:02:53] but we did
[1:02:58] that's why i preached in 74 what i did
[1:03:02] but it didn't shut up nobody because he
[1:03:05] wasn't even listening
[1:03:07] they cared nothing about it they had
[1:03:09] their own predictions
[1:03:10] like i told you told a dream in like
[1:03:13] about 70
[1:03:14] a little girl about this high and little
[1:03:16] boy about this high
[1:03:18] and that little girl was to be our
[1:03:20] little girl me and nanny
[1:03:22] and that little boy was to be and in the
[1:03:24] dream i knew that was to be
[1:03:26] brother moat's son forrest
[1:03:30] forest and anna's right about the same
[1:03:31] age and everybody liked
[1:03:34] because 70 see by 73 if the baby was
[1:03:37] born right then it'd only be two or
[1:03:38] three years old
[1:03:40] if it's seven it wouldn't have to be ten
[1:03:41] years old no you're going to miss it
[1:03:46] you're going to miss it you don't
[1:03:49] believe the prophet
[1:03:54] they got tired of listening to service
[1:03:56] after service
[1:03:58] about those things all right
[1:04:02] but you know what we're here now and you
[1:04:05] know what anna's not here because
[1:04:08] the lily's sick but you know anna she's
[1:04:10] quite a little bit more above
[1:04:12] that now and so is forest
[1:04:15] but you know they're here and you know
[1:04:16] we're still here
[1:04:19] so something must have went wrong we
[1:04:21] must have not
[1:04:22] got it figured out if we had it it would
[1:04:25] have happened
[1:04:27] if it had been a thus saith the lord
[1:04:30] it would have happened but it wasn't of
[1:04:33] thus saith the lord
[1:04:35] he said the visions god showed him but
[1:04:38] he said i predict
[1:04:41] okay listen
[1:04:44] go ahead to number 10. we'll try to get
[1:04:46] these
[1:04:48] which is taken from the 70th week of
[1:04:52] daniel
[1:04:55] and here comes around and shows and then
[1:04:57] i predicted
[1:04:59] i never said the lord told me that but
[1:05:01] standing there that morning
[1:05:03] in the church i said the way progress
[1:05:08] i got back to one end of the wall and
[1:05:11] run to the other end of the wall
[1:05:13] and i said the way god the way prog
[1:05:16] progress is going on
[1:05:18] i'll predict at the time i don't know
[1:05:21] why i'm saying this
[1:05:23] but i predict that that'll happen
[1:05:27] all between right now 1933
[1:05:31] and 1977.
[1:05:35] yeah he said i predict that'll take
[1:05:38] place
[1:05:39] you know what i believe he believed that
[1:05:42] because he sure spent a lot of time
[1:05:43] explaining it didn't he
[1:05:50] i believe he knew what happened that
[1:05:51] year
[1:05:56] i said something happened that's where
[1:05:57] people don't know
[1:05:59] listen i don't know why i'm saying it
[1:06:04] so it's not a number pulled out of the
[1:06:06] air you know
[1:06:07] and he he didn't read i don't think he
[1:06:10] might have read the pyramids of egypt
[1:06:12] which in one of those
[1:06:13] the guy says the end of the wall is 1977
[1:06:16] and that was put out before brother
[1:06:17] branham
[1:06:18] made any or the life's thoughts about it
[1:06:20] or was somewhere i forgot the exact year
[1:06:22] but he knew nothing about brother
[1:06:24] branham it was just a prediction
[1:06:27] but brother branhams was predictions
[1:06:30] not thus saith the lord it was
[1:06:33] predictions
[1:06:35] well i'll take brother brown's
[1:06:36] prediction for okay
[1:06:38] go ahead take the predictions all you
[1:06:41] want to
[1:06:41] the only thing i want you to do
[1:06:44] would you mind reaching over and
[1:06:47] pinching your hand
[1:06:54] right how about pinching your hand
[1:06:57] you know what i mean by that don't you
[1:06:59] you're still here
[1:07:01] we're all still here
[1:07:05] what's the profit wrong
[1:07:10] but nobody won't tackle 77.
[1:07:14] because he don't know what it is and i
[1:07:17] wouldn't either if he hadn't told me
[1:07:22] but let's read he said i don't know why
[1:07:24] i'm saying it
[1:07:27] that was back when he was saying it a
[1:07:29] few years before then
[1:07:30] now watch him but i predicted it all
[1:07:34] happened between right now
[1:07:35] 1933 and 1977 and not knowing it
[1:07:40] watch him god knows my heart
[1:07:43] i never knowed it until yesterday what
[1:07:46] was he doing
[1:07:50] he was studying the years
[1:07:54] that israel was going to house and from
[1:07:58] their start to where it was
[1:08:01] and when he did he did he winds up with
[1:08:03] the number 77 listen
[1:08:07] and not knowing god knows my heart i
[1:08:09] never noted
[1:08:10] until yesterday that 1977
[1:08:14] is the jubilee
[1:08:18] no that's a year you are poured
[1:08:24] come on church at least wake up
[1:08:27] come on can't you do one thing
[1:08:31] you're here how many years past 77 are
[1:08:34] we here
[1:08:37] right on 40-something years right
[1:08:41] but everybody had it figured out it's
[1:08:42] going to be there
[1:08:46] what happened why did it not take place
[1:08:55] you say you're arrogant and hateful
[1:08:57] there's one thing about it but you ain't
[1:08:58] gonna misunderstand me
[1:09:00] i'm gonna make it so plain until you'll
[1:09:02] at least know what i'm talking about
[1:09:04] you may not believe it and that ain't
[1:09:06] nothing to me
[1:09:07] but it's whether or not god can say it i
[1:09:10] ain't saying it brother branham said
[1:09:12] 77. he said it was the jubilee
[1:09:16] right 77 was the tripoli
[1:09:23] no 77 was a year oh boy
[1:09:28] something happened in 1977.
[1:09:35] i told you last sunday 1977 meant more
[1:09:38] to me
[1:09:40] than 11 11
[1:09:44] 46 with the angel coming well because it
[1:09:47] had something to do with me
[1:09:50] that's when the message became alive to
[1:09:52] me
[1:09:54] two years later i preached the seven
[1:10:00] seals
[1:10:06] that 1974 came out of the series of
[1:10:09] daniel 70 weeks
[1:10:16] that i had preached before then
[1:10:21] because there's where he sent it
[1:10:25] look i never know to yesterday 1977
[1:10:28] is the jubilee now brother dale i want
[1:10:31] to ask you a question what's 1977
[1:10:34] what'd the prophet say
[1:10:39] he said don't you say that i say it's
[1:10:42] going to be the end
[1:10:43] or the lord's coming or the rapture is
[1:10:45] coming right so it ain't none of them
[1:10:48] brother branham what is what was 77
[1:10:53] he said it was the tripoli
[1:10:59] there was a release took place there
[1:11:05] if you want to stay all afternoon we'll
[1:11:07] preach a little while about how the
[1:11:08] church ages ended
[1:11:12] because you're birthed out of the age we
[1:11:15] won't go that way
[1:11:18] look 1977 is the jubilee
[1:11:22] and exactly the same amount of time run
[1:11:25] out that he gave with israel
[1:11:27] and everything at the end so we're and
[1:11:30] here we are
[1:11:31] at the end of the age at the coming in
[1:11:34] of the 70th week
[1:11:36] what is it but brother dale we're not
[1:11:39] supposed
[1:11:40] to know the dates of the times and
[1:11:43] seasons
[1:11:46] all right go ahead to number
[1:11:50] 11
[1:11:53] based on seven visions along with the
[1:11:55] rapid change
[1:11:57] which have swept the world in the last
[1:12:00] 50 years i predict
[1:12:02] i do not prophesy that these visions
[1:12:05] will have all come to piss
[1:12:07] by 1977. though many may feel that that
[1:12:11] is an
[1:12:12] irresponsible statement in view of the
[1:12:15] fact that jesus said that no man knoweth
[1:12:18] the day or the hour
[1:12:20] i still maintain the prediction
[1:12:23] after 30 years because
[1:12:26] jesus did not say no man could know the
[1:12:29] year
[1:12:35] month or week in which his coming was to
[1:12:38] be completed
[1:12:42] so don't throw it to me and say well we
[1:12:43] ain't supposed to know the day in the
[1:12:44] hour brother dale
[1:12:47] he says we can know within a year but
[1:12:50] one time he said it may be a hundred
[1:12:52] years i may miss it
[1:12:55] you remember that one last week he said
[1:12:57] it may be a hundred years
[1:12:59] maybe 20 years maybe a hundred years
[1:13:02] okay but listen
[1:13:07] people who say brother brown said jesus
[1:13:09] come in 1977
[1:13:11] off the message the 70th week he said i
[1:13:13] never
[1:13:14] i never said no such thing jesus may
[1:13:17] come today
[1:13:19] but i have predicted that between 33 and
[1:13:21] 77 something would take place
[1:13:25] okay now let's go real fast
[1:13:29] now we're back up to where we started at
[1:13:32] okay go back to number one let's go for
[1:13:34] real fast
[1:13:37] do you jump back in you're doing back to
[1:13:39] number one
[1:13:40] the number one is the one where brother
[1:13:42] branham just said
[1:13:44] 1977 is
[1:13:47] the jubilee what jubilee
[1:13:50] now we're going to read down here what
[1:13:51] that jubilee is because he said it's the
[1:13:54] 70th jubilee
[1:13:56] 1977 was the 70th jubilee
[1:13:58] since the beginning of jubilees from
[1:14:00] according to leviticus 25
[1:14:02] 8 that's what he said
[1:14:06] so 1977 was the 70th jubilee
[1:14:12] it wasn't a date or a time or a season
[1:14:17] it was an opportunity for a release
[1:14:22] okay come on
[1:14:25] i predict that between 1933 not knowing
[1:14:28] it
[1:14:30] he said it's it's the jubilee right
[1:14:33] i predict no no going up now let's let's
[1:14:35] read real fights we've got 10 minutes
[1:14:37] this is taking starting on paragraph 195
[1:14:41] of the 70th week of daniel so he's
[1:14:44] coming down
[1:14:45] and he's bringing striking statement
[1:14:47] from the time god made the promise to
[1:14:48] abraham
[1:14:49] that's in genesis 12. i believe that's
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:53] don't miss this from the time god made
[1:14:56] the promise to abraham
[1:14:57] yeah genesis 12 3 to the time of christ
[1:15:00] being rejected in a.d
[1:15:01] 33 by the jews according to galatians 3
[1:15:04] 16 and 17
[1:15:06] and according to ushers usher's chronic
[1:15:09] chronology of the hebrews
[1:15:11] the power of god was with the jews
[1:15:13] exactly 1954 years
[1:15:16] okay now watch him god dealt with the
[1:15:19] jews 1954 years according to the
[1:15:21] chronology
[1:15:22] of the jews and according to galatians 3
[1:15:24] 16. all right coming on up
[1:15:26] now counting the time we find that we
[1:15:29] have exactly
[1:15:30] listen 17 years left and we will have
[1:15:32] the same span of time given to us as god
[1:15:34] dealing with us
[1:15:36] in the power of the holy spirit since
[1:15:37] a.d 33
[1:15:40] to 1977 the same span of time 1954 years
[1:15:49] see people spent time trying to prove
[1:15:50] right around wrong
[1:15:52] they've never tackled that because they
[1:15:53] don't know what he's saying
[1:15:56] because that's 1944 years that's 1954
[1:15:59] years or not
[1:16:03] come on it's 19 when you come into 1954
[1:16:07] you subtract 33 from 77 what will it
[1:16:10] give you
[1:16:12] 1944. there's a 10-year discrepancy
[1:16:16] but remembers how many times the
[1:16:18] calendars have been changed
[1:16:19] since you started back there in genesis
[1:16:22] now mark it down in a little
[1:16:23] in a book a little scripture here i want
[1:16:25] to give you
[1:16:27] now we got the jubilee established
[1:16:31] 77 is that
[1:16:35] listen beginning with the eighth verse
[1:16:38] god calls the jubilee every 49th year
[1:16:42] the 50th year was the jubilee we know
[1:16:44] that we understand that from the first
[1:16:46] jubilee
[1:16:47] of leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the
[1:16:51] 70th jubilee
[1:16:53] making exactly 3 430 years jubilee means
[1:16:57] to going up the release
[1:17:00] how did we come to that number
[1:17:04] if you take a jubilee being ever 50
[1:17:08] you're going to come to the wrong number
[1:17:11] because 70 times 50 to be 3 500.
[1:17:13] is that a mathematical is that since
[1:17:16] there's a lot of educated in here they
[1:17:17] can count that far
[1:17:18] i take my shoes off
[1:17:22] but he said 1977 be the 70th jubilee
[1:17:26] since the beginning of jubilees simply
[1:17:29] multiply 49 times 70.
[1:17:34] that's 3 430 years he was right through
[1:17:36] the day
[1:17:37] 1977 was the 70th jubilee
[1:17:42] they had had 70 jubilees
[1:17:48] in 1977 was a sad deal making 3 430
[1:17:51] years he knew the years it was
[1:17:55] now once did you get that god has dealt
[1:17:57] with us exactly the same amount of time
[1:17:59] that he dealt with the jews
[1:18:00] from the time he gave abraham the
[1:18:02] promise until the rejecting of the
[1:18:03] messiah
[1:18:04] in 1833 was 1954 years and now we have
[1:18:08] 17 years left that's where he's counting
[1:18:10] from where the messages preach watch 61.
[1:18:14] we've got 17 years left until 77 will be
[1:18:17] the 70th jubilee
[1:18:18] since the beginning of jubilees and what
[1:18:21] will it be
[1:18:26] what will 77 be what would you believe
[1:18:28] be
[1:18:32] what would the jubilee be
[1:18:37] what will it be oh brother watch close
[1:18:39] now don't miss it
[1:18:40] it'll be the jubilee of the going up
[1:18:43] of the gentile bride
[1:18:47] and the return of christ to the jews
[1:18:48] when they go out of bondage
[1:18:52] that one's been argued over they can't
[1:18:54] figure that out because you ain't
[1:18:55] listening to what he says
[1:18:57] 1977-70 jubilee
[1:19:01] 1977 you had had 70 jubilees
[1:19:05] making 3 430 years what will it be
[1:19:09] what will 77 be no what will the jubilee
[1:19:13] be
[1:19:19] what will the jubilee be it would be a
[1:19:23] release
[1:19:25] when the gentile bride's goes in the
[1:19:28] rapture
[1:19:30] you say yeah but then it's just a little
[1:19:33] and that's been a way back there
[1:19:35] you ain't listening 1977
[1:19:38] set a process in motion that your bride
[1:19:41] can take a change of the body
[1:19:43] a jubilee a release
[1:19:47] when we go out of here israel gets this
[1:19:49] message
[1:19:50] right you know what they get it under
[1:19:54] a 49
[1:19:58] we get it under a 50 to take the rapture
[1:20:00] they get it under a 49.
[1:20:04] so had it taken place in 1977
[1:20:08] you give israel a 49 you had 49
[1:20:14] on two
[1:20:17] that will put you one more jubilee 34 30
[1:20:21] add 49
[1:20:24] on to 1977 and you come out to be
[1:20:28] 20 16 26
[1:20:32] 20 26 right 1977
[1:20:36] plus 49 would carry to 2020 26
[1:20:39] 20. all right is that right
[1:20:44] 2026. make sure we get it right on the
[1:20:46] tape 2026.
[1:20:48] all right he said yeah but
[1:20:52] that's to them what about us 1977 was
[1:20:55] the 50th to you and me
[1:20:58] you add 50 you just get one more year i
[1:21:01] never taught no such thing
[1:21:02] that the rapture was coming at 77. show
[1:21:05] me i got the tapes i can prove i didn't
[1:21:09] don't go to your well i heard you say so
[1:21:11] and so
[1:21:12] well you didn't hear me say that
[1:21:16] because i've never taught any dates or
[1:21:17] times or seasons
[1:21:19] i said then it's 1974
[1:21:22] we can go past the year 2026
[1:21:27] and not break the prophet's message
[1:21:31] nor the bible i said that
[1:21:35] in 1974
[1:21:38] i still say it today
[1:21:42] he said well brother dale that's getting
[1:21:43] us closer hey let me give you another
[1:21:46] calculations
[1:21:49] we're in the year 2019 right
[1:21:52] you add seven more onto that what you
[1:21:54] got
[1:21:56] 2026 right what if that seven is
[1:22:00] israel's ministry
[1:22:03] we could be leaving out of here today
[1:22:09] what if that other part is to israel
[1:22:13] it don't make no difference to me
[1:22:15] because you see i ain't never tried to
[1:22:16] prove no dates
[1:22:17] and i ain't scared of what's going on
[1:22:22] i've been settled in my mind about dates
[1:22:25] and times and seasons
[1:22:27] from all the way back there
[1:22:31] it can go to 2026
[1:22:34] not break the prophet's message now
[1:22:35] here's one that's going to slap you in
[1:22:37] the face
[1:22:38] if that's israel to carry the 49 it'll
[1:22:41] be 2026.
[1:22:42] if it's the bride to carry the 50 we can
[1:22:45] be here to the year 5 000
[1:22:48] 10 000 100 000.
[1:22:52] oh you didn't hear them things that i
[1:22:55] said back there
[1:22:59] you know why because if you enter the 50
[1:23:02] you ain't got no time 1977 we entered
[1:23:08] a release when this message will be what
[1:23:11] will take us
[1:23:12] now give me a second then we'll quit
[1:23:15] according to leviticus you've got the
[1:23:17] messenger coming
[1:23:18] to 7-7 just 49.
[1:23:22] all right but around this message struck
[1:23:24] the earth
[1:23:28] right struck the earth back there
[1:23:33] because i believe he was the one to ride
[1:23:35] through the land to tell us we could go
[1:23:37] free don't you
[1:23:39] so 1977 would have started an
[1:23:42] opportunity
[1:23:45] if we'd just listen to the prophet
[1:23:47] instead of our own ideas
[1:23:49] we'd have been out of here a whole lot
[1:23:50] quicker
[1:23:52] but we're still here so that means you
[1:23:54] know what that means everybody that
[1:23:56] comes in
[1:23:57] has got to come in that means as wade
[1:23:59] said the other day if we're looking for
[1:24:01] the life seed
[1:24:02] it may be the life seed sitting in this
[1:24:03] church it may be the last person in
[1:24:05] india
[1:24:06] but it may be the last person that got
[1:24:08] saved five years ago
[1:24:12] because growth development is involved
[1:24:16] in the stature of a perfect man
[1:24:19] so you see but brother dale you're just
[1:24:23] so
