[31:11] and the way i got this thought was and
[31:14] it's really strange you know how
[31:17] brother branham one day picked up a pack
[31:18] of cigarettes or a pack
[31:21] out in the woods that somebody throw
[31:24] down and he preached a very profound
[31:26] sermon from that a thinking man's filter
[31:29] uh kind of strange but you know what
[31:31] that's what god used
[31:33] so i was thinking the other day about
[31:34] all the sickness and all the stuff
[31:36] everybody's going through and i look out
[31:38] at the world and
[31:39] and you know you you go to these places
[31:41] and we're all trying to be good and
[31:43] we're trying to wear a mask and we're
[31:44] trying to
[31:45] social distance and then here goes a guy
[31:47] walking by you smoking a cigarette
[31:49] and you know beers fall out of his car
[31:53] and he's just living any way he wants to
[31:55] and
[31:55] he's not sick it makes a human wonder
[32:00] if it doesn't make you wonder then
[32:01] you're not a human but it does make you
[32:04] wonder why do the heathen rage why can
[32:08] they do what they do
[32:11] yet the little bride seems to be
[32:12] suffering
[32:14] but we'll show i believe what the bible
[32:17] told us
[32:18] how to take care of this because
[32:21] remember this is not our world
[32:24] this is not our home unless that guy
[32:27] gets regenerated and gets
[32:28] born again the cigarette smoking guy
[32:31] he's not going to make it past
[32:33] just white throne judgment he has no
[32:35] other future
[32:36] but you and i we have a future it's not
[32:39] even really a future
[32:42] it's here if you have eternal life today
[32:45] it is here
[32:46] okay but but we do have a future home
[32:48] something we can go to
[32:49] right because of maybe sometimes of our
[32:52] little sufferings that we suffer
[32:54] but um brother aaron i'm sure he's
[32:56] downstairs because levi didn't drive
[32:58] himself to
[32:59] church so thank goodness
[33:03] but pray for brother aaron will be
[33:05] speaking wednesday night we're going to
[33:06] keep on this line
[33:07] where the brothers will be doing
[33:09] wednesday and i'll be doing sundays
[33:11] till we get the until we get the
[33:13] plowmaster back
[33:15] we want them we want the brother they're
[33:16] plowing again amen
[33:18] and i know he's watching in and i told
[33:21] brother bob and this is the way
[33:23] this is the way god works i believe
[33:26] because brother dale and i we don't
[33:27] discuss a lot of things because you get
[33:31] sometimes you catch each other's spirit
[33:33] and and
[33:35] i'm i'm i'm praying that's the holy
[33:36] spirit that we catch
[33:38] and but you get something may pull you
[33:40] off one side or the other brother claude
[33:42] always
[33:43] said that would be stealing your fire so
[33:45] the other night i was
[33:47] staying with mom and dad and i was
[33:49] thinking about this sermon
[33:51] and and just kind of putting it in and
[33:53] and kind of
[33:54] not being in the framework of the two
[33:56] spirits and
[33:58] you know how dad cuts and paste you know
[34:00] he literally cuts it out and paste it on
[34:02] the
[34:02] on the piece of paper well he was
[34:05] sitting across the room there and him
[34:07] and mom and
[34:08] and i was sitting on the couch and i had
[34:10] my computer up
[34:12] and i was getting sermon ready and he
[34:15] little did he know and he'll know it a
[34:16] little bit later on little did he know
[34:18] all
[34:19] not all but every he just started
[34:21] preaching
[34:23] so he's ready to go we just got to get
[34:25] his body but i'm sitting there
[34:27] typing almost what he's talking about
[34:32] and he's not we're not i'm just going
[34:34] uh-huh and i'm just doing this and he's
[34:36] you know he's talking away and preaching
[34:37] the way and talking about death and how
[34:39] that you know we suffer this and we do
[34:41] go through this again i'm just sitting
[34:42] there putting quotes in
[34:43] writing left and pulling scriptures up
[34:45] and cutting and pasting them in
[34:46] what you're going to see right now it's
[34:48] basically what he was preaching on so i
[34:50] i kind of figured this is in a good line
[34:53] if he was thinking about it then you
[34:55] know
[34:55] and brother bob there he was wednesday
[34:57] night and brother louise everybody's
[34:58] kind of been plowing in the same
[35:00] same field so we appreciate that you
[35:03] ought to appreciate that because that's
[35:05] god
[35:06] that's not me and bob and and louise and
[35:08] aaron and dad get together
[35:10] and go now what are we going to preach
[35:12] on no
[35:14] no we kind of let god talk to bob
[35:18] god talk to brother louise different
[35:19] ones you understand what i mean
[35:21] so he'll he'll probably smile when we
[35:23] start reading some of these scriptures
[35:25] and quotes that
[35:26] that he was talking about uh the other
[35:28] night sitting at the
[35:29] sitting around the uh in the living room
[35:31] so but he's getting that he's getting on
[35:33] the man next sunday we're gonna do the
[35:34] same thing so just keep doing the same
[35:36] thing we've been doing for a little
[35:37] while
[35:38] and uh may the lord bless you and keep
[35:40] you and we're just gonna preach today
[35:42] just a little bit
[35:43] and talk about a man named david
[35:47] so let's go to the lord in prayer the
[35:49] heavenly father thank you for
[35:51] this day and hour that we're living in
[35:53] as the scripture said there brother
[35:54] callie was reading the day of the lord
[35:57] this is truly not a 24-hour day lord
[35:59] this is your day
[36:00] this is your time this is your bride
[36:04] this is your word that you give us for
[36:05] this end time you have equipped us for
[36:08] everything we need
[36:10] lord all we have to do is put on that
[36:12] helmet
[36:13] grab the sword put on the shield all the
[36:16] different things lord that we need to do
[36:18] and
[36:19] and go out to battle because we've
[36:21] already won
[36:23] we've just got to have faith to believe
[36:27] that it's happening now and it's not
[36:29] coming in the future
[36:31] father we pray that you bless the ones
[36:32] that are sick the ones that are not here
[36:33] today father we pray that you'd be with
[36:35] them
[36:36] be with the ones on the highways be with
[36:37] the missionaries lord be with all them
[36:39] in the foreign field lord they're
[36:40] everybody's kind of uh on their own now
[36:43] and not
[36:44] traveling back and forth so much so i
[36:46] pray that you would lift the people up
[36:48] lord
[36:48] and take care of them and lead them in
[36:50] guide and by your holy spirit lord
[36:52] we know you do the work but you said you
[36:54] would do it through human beings lord
[36:56] so we pray that you would touch all of
[36:58] us here in the building
[37:00] lord use me for your service bless this
[37:02] day in jesus name
[37:03] amen now here's david
[37:06] the great king in psalms 2 verse 1
[37:10] right at the very first of the psalm he
[37:11] says why do the heathen rage
[37:15] and the people imagine a vain thing
[37:20] the kings of the earth set themselves
[37:22] and the rulers take counsel together
[37:25] against the lord now there's your two
[37:26] spirits
[37:28] and against his anointed saying
[37:31] let us break their bands asunder and
[37:34] cast away their cords from us
[37:38] but watch what david said he that
[37:40] sitteth in the heavens
[37:42] shall laugh
[37:46] the lord shall have them in derision
[37:50] in other words whatever they got god's
[37:54] already up there
[37:55] he's already got the plan worked out he
[37:57] already knows what they're going to do
[37:58] and he already has provision
[38:00] made he didn't have to create a standard
[38:03] he
[38:04] just raised it up now man because he is
[38:06] the standard you may be seated in the
[38:08] lord as blessing
[38:09] the reading of his word
[38:13] like i said today we're just going to
[38:14] preach a little bit we'll just kind of
[38:16] take that subject there
[38:17] why do the heathen raise and i want you
[38:19] to keep that in your mind because it
[38:20] does go through your mind
[38:21] why in the world i know uh sister ruth
[38:24] sitting here you know and i thank god
[38:25] for her
[38:25] being in that covert ward helping us to
[38:28] find out the different times we
[38:30] i don't want to say lost him but um
[38:33] we didn't lose him like that but you
[38:35] know the hospital kind of moved him
[38:36] around so
[38:37] anyway it's good to have friends in in
[38:39] places like that
[38:40] and a good sister to take care and may
[38:42] god protect her to take care of all
[38:44] these but she see
[38:45] like she said today this morning she was
[38:47] talking about a 90
[38:48] 90 year old the older lady 90 year old
[38:51] lady that had coveted and she's walking
[38:53] around
[38:54] bouncing off the walls trying to get out
[38:55] of the hospital has hardly any symptoms
[38:57] at all
[38:59] but yet you see a 30 year old or a 40
[39:01] year old come in there and they have to
[39:03] put them on a respirator well why does
[39:05] you know you why does all this happen i
[39:07] i've
[39:08] and like i said before you know you you
[39:10] try to go into walmart you try to go to
[39:12] these different places and
[39:14] and you walk around and you're trying to
[39:15] keep your lungs clear
[39:17] and you're trying to do the best you can
[39:19] do and the first thing you do is you
[39:21] walk through this cloud of of cigarette
[39:23] smoke
[39:26] right yes you see the guy laughing with
[39:28] the beer in his hand and he's just
[39:30] having a good time and
[39:31] wow i mean you know it just makes you
[39:34] wonder
[39:36] and i believe that's what happened to
[39:37] david because here's david now let's
[39:39] take david just for a minute
[39:41] and then we're going to read on a little
[39:43] further in the psalms
[39:45] in psalms 18 in just a minute but look
[39:47] now david as a young boy was anointed
[39:51] by samuel to be king amen so he knew
[39:55] he believed what his prophet said
[39:59] that sounds familiar we believed
[40:02] even though before he even set one foot
[40:06] on the throne
[40:08] samuel anointed him the prophet of the
[40:11] hour
[40:11] anointed this boy but the boy had to
[40:15] mature
[40:17] but he anointed him nonetheless and so
[40:20] god sent us a prophet in the end time
[40:24] and he proclaimed an anointing on you
[40:27] and i
[40:27] that we were going to what we were going
[40:30] to mature
[40:31] or come to maturity like no other age
[40:34] has come to maturity
[40:35] amen and that you and i are going to
[40:38] come to a body change that no one else
[40:40] has come to except the lord jesus
[40:42] himself
[40:43] no man is reaching immortality except
[40:46] what jesus christ
[40:47] amen no one you say what about enough
[40:51] see you go asking ques
[40:52] i i don't worry about that god's got
[40:56] that
[40:57] i'm just going by what i see that the
[41:00] prophet of god told us
[41:02] that we are going to someone is going to
[41:05] take a body
[41:06] change in this hour that death is going
[41:09] to be destroyed
[41:11] death will be just like a toothache or
[41:13] brother bryan said cancer would be like
[41:15] a toothache well look at what's going on
[41:16] now
[41:19] look at this how it affects people like
[41:21] we were talking this morning you
[41:22] you just can't figure the thing out
[41:25] that's the problem it kind of bounces
[41:26] around all over people and we're talking
[41:28] about this covered but
[41:29] let's go back to david he was anointed
[41:31] by his
[41:32] prophet of the hour at a very young age
[41:37] remember he went through all them
[41:39] brothers
[41:40] nope not the first age not the second
[41:42] age not the third age not the fourth
[41:44] he come to the seventh
[41:48] he come into the seventh church age and
[41:50] he said oh you are now
[41:52] anointed to be king and no doubt david
[41:56] probably realized it but you know what
[41:58] david went right back out into the field
[42:02] and was watching sheep the very next day
[42:03] why because he was an obedient child
[42:06] but in his mind he got a revelation
[42:10] now listen this is what i'm asking you
[42:12] today do you believe what your prophet
[42:15] anointed you with if you believe then it
[42:18] doesn't matter that's why i said about
[42:20] david
[42:21] david went through all this adversity
[42:23] even as a young child he killed a bear
[42:25] he killed a lion
[42:26] and as a very young boy he killed a man
[42:29] named goliath
[42:30] those things were just bumps in the road
[42:33] for david because he
[42:35] that seed had been planted in his mind
[42:37] in the womb of his mind
[42:40] that he was going to be the king you
[42:41] know why because he believed samuel
[42:44] and i believe while he was swinging that
[42:45] thing and he was
[42:47] he said got to get through this this is
[42:50] my next battle
[42:52] i got to get through the next one
[42:53] because you know what my throne is in
[42:55] jerusalem
[42:56] my throne is down there that's where
[42:58] i've got to go and this is what i got to
[43:00] get by
[43:02] this is what i got to get through as
[43:04] brother bob was talking about
[43:06] uh wednesday night sometimes and we do
[43:09] we get we get caught up with
[43:10] circumstances and we get caught up with
[43:13] in our mind why does this why does this
[43:15] person that seem not to affect and why
[43:18] we don't need to worry about that david
[43:20] didn't worry about
[43:22] he didn't even worry about saul
[43:25] and saul became his enemy he didn't
[43:27] worry about king saul he
[43:29] he knew that was only temporary
[43:32] he knew what he was fixing to do to
[43:34] goliath was only temporary
[43:37] but he had to do it he had to go through
[43:40] it
[43:41] he had to kill the bear he had to kill
[43:42] the lion he had to kill goliath
[43:44] he had to do these things in his journey
[43:47] but what was the
[43:48] end result david did sit on that throne
[43:52] and became i this is what i was thinking
[43:54] about yesterday david was so blessed as
[43:57] a king
[43:58] god thought so much of david he said
[44:00] your throne is going to be all the way
[44:02] into the millennium now remember
[44:04] david's not going to sit on the throne
[44:06] but the son of david
[44:08] jesus christ is going to sit on the
[44:10] throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel
[44:13] in the millennium as the throne of david
[44:19] that's how much you thought about that
[44:20] man that took what his prophet said
[44:23] and just kept walking doesn't matter the
[44:27] adversity that david had david had many
[44:29] opportunities
[44:30] to to just say i quit
[44:33] i'm done i'm finished
[44:37] but he killed goliath now watch then he
[44:39] made saul
[44:40] mad then he had to depend on god
[44:45] to get by saul because saul was a king
[44:50] no doubt saul had spies it wasn't just
[44:52] one man saul trying to kill david
[44:55] no he had a counsel that he i'm sure he
[44:57] said all right guys
[44:59] first time you see this man right here i
[45:00] want him dead
[45:03] so david had to take that into account
[45:06] every day
[45:08] something was trying to kill him
[45:12] something was trying to end his life
[45:15] be it coveted be a cancer be whatever
[45:17] you want to talk about
[45:19] every day of your life something is
[45:21] right here
[45:24] remember there's a shadow of death but
[45:27] remember what brother brown said thank
[45:28] god for a prophet
[45:29] brother brown said there had to be a
[45:31] light to be a shadow
[45:34] yeah though i walk through the valley of
[45:36] the shadow of death
[45:37] so there's got to be light there but
[45:40] that shadow is what's cast behind us and
[45:42] that shadow was cast behind david
[45:44] pretty much all his life
[45:48] but he believed
[45:52] what his prophet told him and he sat on
[45:55] that throne
[45:55] just exactly like samuel said he would
[46:00] now remember there had to be a saul
[46:01] there at first
[46:05] then you had david he won many battles
[46:08] folks
[46:12] remember the mulberry tree
[46:15] david said god should i go now well now
[46:18] the first time he was with the felis
[46:20] he was fighting the philistines kind of
[46:22] strange he started fighting with him at
[46:23] one time
[46:24] you read that he started fighting with
[46:26] the philistines the philistines
[46:28] that he had killed the the big the big
[46:30] giant and he started fighting with him
[46:31] but hearing one time i was reading
[46:33] last night where he comes to a place he
[46:35] says god
[46:36] how many times do we do that see that's
[46:39] why david was the apple of god's eye
[46:41] every time he come into a battle he
[46:44] didn't just
[46:45] force his way into the battle
[46:48] he said god should i go up today
[46:53] god should i put my feet on the ground
[46:56] and go to work and fight the traffic and
[46:59] fight the heathens
[47:01] god says david go up for the battle is
[47:03] yours
[47:05] wow you say oh i've never heard that
[47:06] voice in my head
[47:10] you got the word that's right what do
[47:13] you need anything else
[47:15] you got the word to tell you what to do
[47:17] it's already been spoken
[47:19] all right so then you got another time
[47:24] where david says okay god here's the
[47:26] philistines we've got them in we've got
[47:27] them in this and we got them in that and
[47:28] he says
[47:29] wait he said go sit under that mulberry
[47:33] tree
[47:34] he said when you hear the going or the
[47:36] rushing in the mulberry tree he said
[47:38] then the battle will be yours see now
[47:39] what would have happened
[47:41] if david would have just took off he'd
[47:43] lost that battle
[47:45] why because he went ahead of the plan of
[47:46] god amen amen
[47:48] god's plan was now you say well why did
[47:51] god make him wait
[47:52] obedience god's looking for obedient
[47:57] people that you want to try to rush in
[48:00] something or try to take care of this
[48:01] situation yourself
[48:04] yeah i owe myself too how many of you
[48:07] are guilty of that
[48:08] if you don't raise your hand i'll raise
[48:09] your hand for you amen
[48:11] okay all right it goes up just like this
[48:14] because every one of us have been in a
[48:16] situation but what did david do
[48:18] david didn't say now lord i think we can
[48:19] get it right now right now is when we
[48:21] can get it
[48:24] he said okay lord i'm gonna go sit under
[48:27] that mulberry tree
[48:28] i don't know what you got for me but
[48:30] they're right there
[48:32] he said david the battle is yours
[48:36] when you hear the going in the mulberry
[48:37] tree he said you take up
[48:39] arms and he literally run him out of the
[48:42] country
[48:43] amen so that's what the devils in our
[48:45] life that we've got to do
[48:48] in our everyday life is listen for that
[48:51] going of the mulberry tree what
[48:53] what brother brown say about elijah uh
[48:56] elijah had a lot of things on his plate
[48:58] but he waited for that still small voice
[49:02] he had all the shouting and all the
[49:03] glory and all the different things but
[49:05] he was like david
[49:06] he went and sat under a mulberry tree
[49:09] and said okay lord
[49:11] what's next and why do the healing rage
[49:15] why
[49:15] lord do we sisters have to have this
[49:18] long hair
[49:20] well we we were somewhere the other day
[49:22] and i saw this woman
[49:23] she's an older lady bless her heart her
[49:25] hair was as short as
[49:27] is that and i thought man all she's got
[49:29] to do is get up in the morning and just
[49:30] kind of do like we do shake it off and
[49:32] you know don't even have to brush your
[49:34] hair kind of like
[49:36] tempo back there you know it looks all
[49:38] messed up all the time
[49:40] but
[49:43] see that's easy but your sisters have
[49:46] long hair
[49:48] you can't just go out the door am i
[49:51] y'all with me today um see the things
[49:54] that we're
[49:55] this is the light suffering or the small
[49:58] suffering things that we do
[50:00] we're looking at it all wrong because
[50:01] i'm going to read you many many
[50:03] many many scriptures and many quotes
[50:05] today brother brown said character
[50:08] is a victory not a gift
[50:11] amen we have gifts of the spirit that
[50:13] god will give us these gifts love joy
[50:15] peace long suffering
[50:16] even these but now re remember that is
[50:19] character
[50:20] amen that's right character
[50:24] is a victory yes not a gift what a
[50:27] profound statement
[50:28] i have a few t-shirts that i wear that i
[50:30] wear proudly
[50:32] because i enjoy it that's a wonderful
[50:33] quote i do have quotes by brother
[50:35] branham on my chest and quotes by
[50:37] whoever amen amen
[50:41] so here we have david
[50:45] but now remember david comes to a point
[50:50] he comes to a point and he says
[50:53] lord i we kind of messed up the other
[50:57] day you know
[50:58] what are you what are we doing we we
[51:00] lost a few men and we
[51:02] we might have lost a little battle here
[51:03] so what what's going on
[51:05] david just didn't realize that he was
[51:07] fixing to get drove
[51:08] off of his throne by his own kid
[51:14] and i believe that's when i believe that
[51:16] david
[51:18] in the stillness of the night just like
[51:20] you and i
[51:21] all have doubts and fears and you go
[51:24] why lord does the heathen rage
[51:29] david says god i know i'm an anointed
[51:32] king
[51:33] and now i don't even have a throne to
[51:35] sit on but you know remember though what
[51:37] david did
[51:37] david didn't he didn't complain
[51:41] he just made a statement lord why does
[51:44] the heathen rage
[51:47] and the people imagine a vain thing
[51:52] i'm your i'm the king
[51:55] he had the whole of the of jerusalem or
[51:59] israel
[52:00] behind david but he had one little
[52:02] problem
[52:03] and when he did he got thrown off the
[52:04] throne
[52:07] and i'm sure he sat up on that hill and
[52:09] just like jesus sat up on that hill and
[52:10] said jerusalem jerusalem
[52:13] how oft would i have hovered you under
[52:16] my wing
[52:17] why but you would not because they what
[52:20] rejected him remember david was a
[52:21] rejected king
[52:23] amen so i and david but now remember
[52:26] david didn't have a pity party because
[52:27] he knew
[52:28] still even though he was in the valley
[52:31] even though
[52:32] he was a king in exile even though he
[52:33] only had about 600 men where he had 60
[52:36] 000
[52:38] but i promise you one thing i'll take
[52:41] the 600 david had
[52:44] you imagine three men fighting for two
[52:46] miles
[52:47] through the philistines just to get to
[52:50] him a drink of water you think that's
[52:52] how much they thought of that man david
[52:55] and david took it with so much honor he
[52:57] said i'm not even worthy to drink this
[53:01] and pour it out on the ground now he
[53:02] didn't pour it on the ground for
[53:03] anything he
[53:04] remember the bible said he poured it out
[53:05] for an offering to god
[53:08] that them three men fought their way two
[53:11] miles through the philistines to get
[53:13] that
[53:14] for david they thought that much of him
[53:18] but he was driven out of his kingdom
[53:21] and i'm sure he sat up there one day and
[53:23] this is where psalms 2 comes from
[53:24] because we're going to read down
[53:25] if you pull up psalms 18. because
[53:28] there's a time when david had victory
[53:30] over all of his enemies
[53:33] there's a time when he come to where he
[53:34] said look this is to the chief
[53:36] musician the psalm of david the servant
[53:38] of the lord who's spaking to the lord
[53:39] the words of this song
[53:41] in the day that the lord delivered him
[53:44] from the hand of all his enemies and
[53:47] from the hand of saul
[53:48] and he said i will love the o lord my
[53:50] strength
[53:51] now remember david it went through a
[53:53] whole lot
[53:54] amen giant bear
[53:57] kicked out saul's trying to kill him
[54:01] david's got the enemies and on every
[54:03] hand
[54:05] the lord is my rock in my fortress and
[54:08] my deliverer
[54:10] my god my strength in whom i will trust
[54:13] my buckler in the horn of my salvation
[54:15] and my high tower
[54:18] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[54:20] to be praised so
[54:22] shall i be saved from mine enemies
[54:26] the sorrows of death compassed me
[54:30] wow pretty close why because saul was
[54:33] going to kill him
[54:34] and he sent people every day to try to
[54:36] kill david
[54:40] so i'm telling you folks if you have the
[54:42] hand of the lord on you if you're born
[54:43] again believer the footsteps of the
[54:45] righteous like i said are order of the
[54:46] lord you will not go
[54:48] until god's done with you and when he's
[54:50] done with you i'm ready to go
[54:53] amen amen when god's done amen
[54:56] circumstance whatever it is the sorrows
[54:58] of death compass me and the floods of
[55:00] ungodly men made me afraid
[55:04] we walk out in this world and don't tell
[55:08] me we don't have a certain amount of
[55:09] fear
[55:11] i said a certain amount we're supposed
[55:13] to walk by faith but we're not going to
[55:14] walk out here in the middle of this road
[55:15] and say god you're going to stop that
[55:16] 18-wheeler
[55:19] now if god gives you a vision and god
[55:22] gives you an anointing
[55:23] you can walk out into the end of the
[55:25] road and god will save you like you did
[55:27] the prophet with the bull and all the
[55:28] different things but listen
[55:30] he hasn't done that to me now if he's
[55:32] done it to you that's fine i'm not going
[55:33] out there
[55:35] because there's danger and i'm afraid
[55:37] that's going to hurt me
[55:39] but what are we going to do though folks
[55:40] when it comes see it's come personal to
[55:43] all of us now
[55:45] everybody has been impacted whether it
[55:48] even be not
[55:48] covered but now it just feels like i
[55:51] don't know if it's with you but there's
[55:53] just a sickness in the air
[55:55] it's just a fog brother donny's
[55:59] daughters are dealing with stuff you
[56:00] know and all everybody's even got
[56:02] people and he was dealing with stuff it
[56:04] wasn't coveted related but it's
[56:05] all sickness it's all seems like that
[56:08] you know lord where are you and that's
[56:10] why
[56:10] david why does the heathen rage who was
[56:12] he talking to he's talking to god
[56:16] why do you why do you let
[56:19] people prosper that are seem to be evil
[56:22] men
[56:23] have you not ever thought that you know
[56:25] i ever wondered like sister ruth said
[56:27] well never wonder that you know you got
[56:28] this just a
[56:30] i mean just a vile person cursing and
[56:33] smoking and drinking
[56:34] he walks in and he might have a little
[56:36] case of cold and they give him a couple
[56:38] of shots and out the door he goes
[56:40] then you bring in a godly saint or a
[56:42] godly saint of god
[56:44] and they have problems and it's they
[56:48] seem to struggle with it
[56:49] i mean in your mind today you we all
[56:52] struggle with it
[56:55] but david asked that one question why
[56:59] does the heathen rage and the people
[57:03] in other words bring a vanity
[57:07] vanity of vanities folks listen we're
[57:11] living in this world
[57:13] temporarily
[57:18] just realize one thing's for sure if
[57:20] you're born again today
[57:22] doesn't matter what god let's allow
[57:24] happen to you
[57:26] it's for your benefit
[57:27] [Music]
[57:29] i'll clap myself it's for your benefit
[57:32] we don't know
[57:34] it's like brother bob said those what
[57:35] sparked some of this sermon
[57:37] is that like david david now listen
[57:40] we're not prophets that we know what's
[57:42] going to happen tomorrow
[57:43] but we see road maps and we see signs on
[57:46] the way
[57:47] signs follow the believers okay so you
[57:50] look at the signs and david looked a
[57:52] sign he said i killed a bear
[57:55] that wasn't too bad killed a lion
[57:59] who is this it's just another bump in
[58:03] the road
[58:05] it's just another something that i got
[58:06] to get through because
[58:10] i'm going to be king now why are you and
[58:12] i we're in revelations 5 we're told
[58:14] we're to be priests and kings
[58:16] and that will rule and reign on the
[58:18] earth now it doesn't say that you're
[58:20] going to have a flowery bed of these
[58:22] it doesn't say that you're just going to
[58:23] one day pop up and
[58:26] no the bible says fiery trials
[58:31] afflictions we'll read those in a few
[58:32] minutes we'll read what brother brown
[58:34] said about it but i want you to look at
[58:35] david though
[58:36] the sorrow of hell compassed me about
[58:38] the snares of death prevented me
[58:41] in my distress i called upon the lord
[58:43] now remember
[58:45] remember the end of this story where did
[58:48] david end up
[58:49] he was on the throne he died
[58:52] the king of israel amen
[58:56] and then he had solomon of course we
[58:58] know that but anyway
[58:59] david is restored just like job look at
[59:02] job circle none of us just went through
[59:04] what job's went through
[59:07] boils all over our body our wife telling
[59:10] us to curse god and die
[59:11] all your kids died
[59:16] your house was destroyed you're setting
[59:19] on the ashes of your house
[59:23] but what did he do with job job said i
[59:26] know
[59:28] in other words i know i've been anointed
[59:30] for some purpose
[59:31] and this journey is yet but a light
[59:34] affliction
[59:36] because remember he was restored double
[59:41] you and i are restored double you know
[59:43] why because we get we got eternal life
[59:45] now but we're going to get eternal life
[59:46] in this body
[59:48] this body's going to be eternal job
[59:50] didn't have that joe said oh i know joe
[59:52] said i know i got to go to the grave
[59:53] because i see people go down they don't
[59:54] come back
[59:55] up he said but i know my redeemer liveth
[59:57] and in the last days
[1:00:00] in my flesh i shall see god
[1:00:04] amen amen in my distress i called upon
[1:00:06] the lord and cried unto my god and he
[1:00:08] heard my voice
[1:00:10] out of his temple and my cry came before
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:14] even into his ears look how personal it
[1:00:17] is
[1:00:17] god's got ears yeah god's a human
[1:00:19] remember
[1:00:21] then the earth shook and trembled
[1:00:24] this world is going to tremble and shake
[1:00:27] when we come to what bob was talking
[1:00:29] about the manifestation of the sons of
[1:00:31] god
[1:00:33] we're getting a little piece of it every
[1:00:35] once in a while now
[1:00:37] but when this thing starts coming
[1:00:38] together which i believe it is now
[1:00:40] we come into speaking condition listen
[1:00:43] there's one thing for sure the anointing
[1:00:45] that's on us
[1:00:48] is going to israel in those two prophets
[1:00:51] and they're going to take that sixth
[1:00:52] seal and they're going to pull plagues
[1:00:54] as many as they want to pull
[1:00:56] earthquakes as many as times as they
[1:00:57] speak well don't you think you and i are
[1:00:59] going to have a small
[1:01:00] temporary amount of that on this side
[1:01:02] because it's the same anointing
[1:01:05] and to get us out of here to get david
[1:01:07] listen what protected david from saul
[1:01:10] killing him
[1:01:11] god and the belief
[1:01:15] that he was going to sit on the throne
[1:01:17] same way with me and you
[1:01:21] why did the heathen raise lord why why
[1:01:24] is my neighbor
[1:01:27] why is my brother that don't even serve
[1:01:29] you no i'm not talking about mine but
[1:01:31] you know you know some of you don't have
[1:01:32] brothers who serve the lord
[1:01:33] why is my sister why is my kid why
[1:01:37] why cry
[1:01:40] why cry listen i
[1:01:44] preach every sunday
[1:01:47] with the promise that my children are
[1:01:50] going to be sitting right here all of
[1:01:51] them
[1:01:52] have one back there but i'm talking
[1:01:53] about my daughter
[1:01:55] i don't i don't go home oh yeah in my
[1:01:58] humanity i do
[1:02:00] i go home and i as the old saying is
[1:02:03] kick the dog
[1:02:05] no i don't kick the dog toby i don't
[1:02:07] kick toby he's too little
[1:02:09] but you know you kind of you kick the
[1:02:11] table and you go what in the world is
[1:02:13] going on my kids are
[1:02:15] now abraham didn't do that abraham just
[1:02:18] kept walking
[1:02:20] that's what you and i got to do keep
[1:02:22] walking and you will walk into it but do
[1:02:25] not stop walking
[1:02:27] amen circumstances is what's killing us
[1:02:33] but listen circumstantial evidence will
[1:02:35] not stand up in the court of law
[1:02:38] our evidence is what the word told us
[1:02:42] what we were going to be in this hour
[1:02:45] not not luther not wesley not pentecost
[1:02:47] this hour
[1:02:49] this day of the lord then the earth
[1:02:51] shook and trembled the foundations of
[1:02:53] the hills moved and were shaken because
[1:02:54] he was wroth
[1:02:55] there went up a smoke out of his
[1:02:56] nostrils and fire out of his mouth
[1:02:58] devoured
[1:02:59] coals were kindled by it he bowed the
[1:03:01] heavens also and came down in darkness
[1:03:04] was under his feet you know why
[1:03:07] he came to judge but if you and i have
[1:03:10] already been judged
[1:03:12] we don't stand there we've already took
[1:03:16] the fiery judgment of god when christ
[1:03:17] went to the cross
[1:03:19] and took that judgment i know this is
[1:03:20] elementary and i know this is going to
[1:03:22] be simple
[1:03:23] but i want you to build yourself to
[1:03:25] where you can see
[1:03:26] that it's not god has not left us
[1:03:30] and just because the little things that
[1:03:32] we do or don't do or have done or
[1:03:35] are the light afflictions as paul would
[1:03:38] tell us
[1:03:40] how many of y'all been stoned
[1:03:44] how many have you been stoned
[1:03:48] how many have had 39 lashes twice
[1:03:53] i'm talking about bent over tied to a
[1:03:56] post
[1:03:59] and i'm sure they're not going
[1:04:03] no in it like 39
[1:04:07] and 40 they say it was kill you or
[1:04:09] something you know he got 39 twice
[1:04:12] paul said these light afflictions
[1:04:18] and we got problems this light
[1:04:22] affliction he wore those stripes his
[1:04:24] whole life
[1:04:29] psalms 37
[1:04:33] the steps of a good man now remember we
[1:04:36] always quote it
[1:04:37] the steps of a righteous man that's not
[1:04:38] in the bible this is the scripture we're
[1:04:40] talking about
[1:04:42] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:04:45] the lord
[1:04:45] and he delighteth in his way
[1:04:50] though he fall we're going to
[1:04:54] he shall not be utterly cast down for
[1:04:56] the lord what upholdeth him
[1:04:58] with his hand i have been young now this
[1:05:01] is david now
[1:05:02] david's in the psalms i have been young
[1:05:04] and now am old
[1:05:06] yet have i not seen the righteous
[1:05:07] forsaken nor his seed
[1:05:10] begging bread listen we've never been
[1:05:11] hungry
[1:05:13] we've never been hungry i went to kroger
[1:05:16] last night and the place had millions of
[1:05:18] dollars worth of food in it and i just
[1:05:19] bought what i needed
[1:05:23] we're not in any kind of tribulation
[1:05:24] here okay
[1:05:27] we're still able to eat what we want to
[1:05:30] but you know what satan knows that our
[1:05:33] body is weak
[1:05:36] because we're getting stronger and
[1:05:37] stronger inside that inside man's
[1:05:39] getting stronger
[1:05:40] and stronger and stronger and satan
[1:05:43] cannot
[1:05:44] hinder that except through your body
[1:05:49] and then he can get in your spirit realm
[1:05:50] and he can give you a memory he can say
[1:05:52] oh
[1:05:53] don't you know that that pain
[1:05:58] i'll get you how many times you ever had
[1:06:01] somebody a little voice in your head say
[1:06:02] you're gonna die
[1:06:05] about once or twice every hour
[1:06:09] i'm going to get you today devil told me
[1:06:12] one time he said
[1:06:13] you'll never see your wife again
[1:06:16] i spend months ago months ago he's a
[1:06:19] liar
[1:06:22] if he does get to you he's got to ask
[1:06:24] god's permission
[1:06:25] that's right amen amen he's got to come
[1:06:28] to god
[1:06:29] and he's got to go can i do something to
[1:06:32] him
[1:06:32] please can i do something to him and
[1:06:35] god's like
[1:06:37] touch his body but leave his soul alone
[1:06:39] that's what he did with job right
[1:06:41] right right he said you go ahead
[1:06:44] but god knew what you would be at the
[1:06:47] end
[1:06:48] that's right and what we've got to
[1:06:49] believe is is that we believe the same
[1:06:51] thing god believed
[1:06:53] we got to believe the same thing god's
[1:06:54] already believing about us right
[1:06:56] because he's going to have a bride that
[1:06:58] will make it he's going to have a bride
[1:07:00] and speaking condition
[1:07:04] but the steps of a good man are ordered
[1:07:07] by the lord psalms 27 verse 1.
[1:07:11] this is a little bit of long reading but
[1:07:12] i want to read this right here anyway
[1:07:13] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:07:16] whom shall i fear
[1:07:20] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:07:22] whom shall i be afraid
[1:07:24] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:07:26] foes come upon me
[1:07:31] to eat up my flesh
[1:07:36] now remember you got to use the
[1:07:38] metaphors not eat
[1:07:41] consume satan has consumed this flesh
[1:07:44] because you know what we're getting
[1:07:45] older
[1:07:46] and older and older but that remember
[1:07:49] we have an example abraham was 99 years
[1:07:53] old when god
[1:07:54] produced the promise
[1:07:58] we know he was changed back but abraham

[1:10:13] angels

[1:11:07] that's what a rock is right he shall set
[1:11:08] me upon a revelation
[1:11:11] and now shall my head be lifted up above

[1:11:19] offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:11:21] what joy
[1:11:23] i will sing yeah i will sing praises
[1:11:25] unto the lord hear o lord when i cry
[1:11:27] with my voice

[1:11:30] answer me
[1:11:32] when thou saitest seek ye my face my
[1:11:34] heart sent unto thee thy face lord
[1:11:36] will i seek remember this is obedient
[1:11:38] child
[1:11:40] verse 9 hide not thou face far from me
[1:11:43] put not thy servant away in anger thou
[1:11:46] hast been my help
[1:11:47] leave me not neither forsake me o god of
[1:11:49] my salvation
[1:11:51] when my father and my mother forsook me
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:55] then the lord will take me up
[1:11:58] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[1:12:00] brandon brother i'm saying
[1:12:02] i'm a son of god teach me thy way o lord
[1:12:06] that's what we've been for 50 and 60
[1:12:08] years god has been
[1:12:09] teaching us how to get deliverance from
[1:12:13] what we're
[1:12:14] in in our daily right now today not six
[1:12:17] year months ago or
[1:12:18] or who would have thought this a year
[1:12:20] ago we're coming up on a year almost but
[1:12:22] who would have thought this a year ago
[1:12:24] right teach me thy way o lord and lead
[1:12:27] me in plain past because of my enemy
[1:12:29] because now look look we're gonna we're
[1:12:33] gonna look in just a few minutes
[1:12:34] why does he keep saying enemy you got to
[1:12:37] have an enemy
[1:12:42] to be approved you got to have an
[1:12:44] adversary
[1:12:46] to build character if it's a victory it
[1:12:48] has to be a victory over an enemy
[1:12:51] it's not a victory over the victorious
[1:12:54] it's victory over that number two spirit
[1:12:56] that we've been talking about
[1:13:00] so look that's why i kept i put in the
[1:13:02] word enemies and boy look at all the
[1:13:03] stuff
[1:13:04] comes up but you got to have them jesus
[1:13:07] had an enemy
[1:13:09] everybody in the bible had an enemy
[1:13:13] it was an enemy somewhere in the picture
[1:13:19] so you and i why are we different we
[1:13:22] ain't different that's right
[1:13:23] same enemy different tactics though
[1:13:26] because what he's done now he's moved
[1:13:28] into the religious realm
[1:13:30] but see if he can't get us in the
[1:13:32] religious realm
[1:13:33] if we've been taught well
[1:13:37] if we're sitting together in heavenly
[1:13:38] places he's been taught well
[1:13:40] and we know how to handle what's coming
[1:13:42] the shots that the
[1:13:43] that the devil's taking what's the next
[1:13:45] thing he's going after
[1:13:47] this guy because he still knows he has a
[1:13:51] little bit of hold on your flesh
[1:13:53] and he for sure can run into your memory
[1:13:55] reason conscious effects and imagination
[1:13:59] deliver me not over unto the will of
[1:14:03] mine enemy
[1:14:05] for false witnesses are risen up against
[1:14:07] me
[1:14:08] and such as breathe out cruelty i had
[1:14:11] fainted
[1:14:12] unless i had believed in other words i
[1:14:15] was going to faint
[1:14:17] i'm getting faint but i had believed to
[1:14:21] see the goodness of the lord
[1:14:23] in the land of the living amen wait on
[1:14:26] the lord yes
[1:14:28] that's our problem
[1:14:32] wait on the lord be of good courage and
[1:14:34] he shall strengthen thine heart the very
[1:14:37] heart of you
[1:14:38] wait i say on the lord now he said that
[1:14:42] twice
[1:14:44] so we better do that if he says
[1:14:46] something twice
[1:14:47] we better listen to what he's saying
[1:14:49] isaiah 59 18 this is very familiar but
[1:14:52] we're going to read it again according
[1:14:53] to their deeds
[1:14:54] according he will repay fury to his
[1:14:57] adversaries recompense
[1:14:58] listen folks you and i
[1:15:02] even though what all we're going through
[1:15:05] we're not going to go through what this
[1:15:07] world is going to go through when we
[1:15:09] leave here
[1:15:11] god has took us in that pavilion he's
[1:15:14] put us in a rocket ship
[1:15:16] and he's going to eject us out of here
[1:15:19] and then all hell is going to break
[1:15:21] loose this ain't nothing compared
[1:15:24] to what's coming to what god has
[1:15:25] protected you from even though you fall
[1:15:28] over the day without a breath in your
[1:15:29] body
[1:15:29] you're more alive that way than you are
[1:15:32] sitting here today because today you're
[1:15:33] dying
[1:15:36] but over that sixth dimension you cannot
[1:15:38] you are eternal
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:43] according to their deeds according he
[1:15:45] will repay so don't worry why does the
[1:15:47] heathen rage
[1:15:48] don't worry we are we are the same as
[1:15:52] the lord jesus we want this whole world
[1:15:54] to be saved
[1:15:56] listen i'm telling you if you walk
[1:15:57] through that listen i didn't walk
[1:15:59] through that cloud of smoke
[1:16:00] saying god strike that man dead that's
[1:16:03] not the right attitude to have
[1:16:07] god give that man my sickness no what'd
[1:16:10] jesus say give it to me
[1:16:14] jesus said i'll take it i'll take every
[1:16:17] sin you did
[1:16:19] i'll take every sickness you'll ever
[1:16:20] have
[1:16:23] that was enough for just one person he
[1:16:25] did it for the whole world
[1:16:28] think of the circumstances
[1:16:32] he still got scars yes that's right for
[1:16:35] your sins and my sin
[1:16:38] amen according to their deeds according
[1:16:41] he will repay so don't worry
[1:16:45] you and i have already been judged so it
[1:16:47] does not matter what happens to this
[1:16:49] flesh
[1:16:49] that's right it will come back
[1:16:54] 100 yes
[1:16:58] as job says as a flesh of a baby
[1:17:04] but folks they don't have a hope
[1:17:08] it's going to be horrible when we leave
[1:17:10] this place
[1:17:13] the bible says your flesh will run off
[1:17:15] of your body
[1:17:16] and the birds will eat your flesh while
[1:17:18] you're still alive
[1:17:21] and we go home and go oh what was me i
[1:17:24] got up
[1:17:28] light affliction temporary
[1:17:34] if you don't look at it that way folks
[1:17:35] it's going to drive you crazy
[1:17:40] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[1:17:43] he will
[1:17:44] repay recompense so shall they fear the
[1:17:47] name of the lord from the east and his
[1:17:49] glory from the rising of the sun
[1:17:52] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:17:53] flood which we know they will
[1:17:56] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:17:58] standard now remember
[1:17:59] he didn't have to build it
[1:18:03] he just lifted it up it's already been
[1:18:06] built
[1:18:06] right he's just going to lift it up
[1:18:10] if satan goes higher he just keeps going
[1:18:12] higher you know i sat there and
[1:18:13] i got a bit boy here's colby i didn't
[1:18:16] know about was coming up so i got
[1:18:20] no already done yeah
[1:18:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:18:27] and the redeemer shall come to where
[1:18:30] zion
[1:18:31] that's you and me and to them that turn
[1:18:34] from transgression in jacob he's talking
[1:18:36] about the jews
[1:18:38] as for me this is my covenant with them
[1:18:41] saith the lord now look my covenant
[1:18:45] does god ever break a covenant never
[1:18:49] as for me this is my covenant with them
[1:18:51] saying the lord my spirit that is upon
[1:18:53] thee
[1:18:54] and my words which i have put in thy
[1:18:56] mouth shall not depart out of
[1:18:58] your mouth nor out of the mouth of thy
[1:19:01] seed
[1:19:02] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[1:19:04] from henceforth and forever
[1:19:07] god said it that settles it
[1:19:11] henceforth forever micah 7 verse 7
[1:19:15] therefore while i look into the lord i
[1:19:17] will wait for the god of my salvation
[1:19:19] my god will hear me rejoice not against
[1:19:22] me o mine enemy
[1:19:24] when i fall i shall rise
[1:19:29] now you that's what i mean you you look
[1:19:31] at those people out there in the world
[1:19:32] that has
[1:19:33] absolutely no hope you want god to help
[1:19:37] them but you know what they can't even
[1:19:38] help their self
[1:19:41] they can't help themselves all they got
[1:19:43] to do is do what you did
[1:19:45] because you was in the same shape they
[1:19:46] were
[1:19:49] we weren't born with a silver spoon in
[1:19:50] the mouth
[1:19:53] our light brother we said um brother but
[1:19:54] we weren't burned when they turned on
[1:19:55] the eternal life in our soul we were
[1:19:57] born
[1:19:57] with an eternal gene that was in god
[1:20:01] and god was waiting boy how patient
[1:20:05] god was waiting on you to say i want
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:09] amen and what god do mary did not carry
[1:20:13] around
[1:20:14] this literal seed to bring jesus christ
[1:20:17] she wasn't born with it she had to
[1:20:21] receive it
[1:20:23] same way with you and i we weren't born
[1:20:25] with jesus in our soul
[1:20:27] we had to receive it one day you had to
[1:20:29] stand here
[1:20:30] or wherever you were and say be it unto
[1:20:32] me absolutely
[1:20:34] according to thy word you said
[1:20:37] if i'll be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:20:39] christ if i repent and be baptized that
[1:20:42] you give me the holy ghost
[1:20:45] there's your seed
[1:20:48] because your seed is a word amen
[1:20:52] not a little seed so see when you make
[1:20:55] even the seed is the word you weren't
[1:20:56] born with the word
[1:20:57] listen you weren't even born by the word
[1:21:01] natural remember you had to be born by
[1:21:05] the breath of god spiritually
[1:21:06] that's why you look i don't see why
[1:21:08] these people in the message don't
[1:21:09] believe they look at they look
[1:21:10] they're just like um
[1:21:14] nicodemus jesus said you must be born
[1:21:19] again
[1:21:20] nicodemus should have said i was born
[1:21:22] right the first time
[1:21:25] no nicodemus what'd he say have i got
[1:21:28] carnal
[1:21:29] have i got to go get back into my
[1:21:31] mother's womb
[1:21:33] and be birthed again if i was jesus i'd
[1:21:36] say no that's what's killing you now
[1:21:39] he said no nicodemus you got to be born
[1:21:41] from above
[1:21:44] amen you got to be born from above and
[1:21:46] he didn't understand any of that
[1:21:48] but you and i do nothing in our natural
[1:21:51] birth but in our spiritual birth is what
[1:21:53] regens us or regenerates us and takes us
[1:21:56] away from all this
[1:21:57] not from pain and sorrow and sickness
[1:21:59] not please
[1:22:01] rejoice not against me oh my enemy when
[1:22:03] i fall i shall rise
[1:22:07] when i sit in darkness the lord shall be
[1:22:09] a light
[1:22:10] unto me i will bear the indignation of
[1:22:14] the lord that's what i said before
[1:22:16] we all
[1:22:19] it's nothing we gave up
[1:22:22] god took it away from us i
[1:22:26] cursed i drank never smoked
[1:22:30] cursed i drank god took that away from
[1:22:32] me
[1:22:34] he took it away he didn't just suppress
[1:22:37] it
[1:22:38] no he took it away from me
[1:22:42] but when people look at you and you you
[1:22:44] talk out in the world and they try to
[1:22:46] hand you a beer

[1:26:26] are eyelash extenders but you see what
[1:26:29] they go through and say that it's good
[1:26:33] they say this is normal right go ahead
[1:26:38] it would scare you to death in the
[1:26:40] morning
[1:26:41] before she put the stuff on yeah
[1:26:45] it's fake yes this is original
[1:26:50] this is the original that god wants
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:54] thank you they think we're crazy
[1:26:59] saw a guy walk out
[1:27:04] we were living in gainesville you know
[1:27:08] when the
[1:27:09] kids first started wearing their pants
[1:27:10] way down to here you know
[1:27:13] this is no joke this guy
[1:27:17] walks out of a convenience store
[1:27:21] and this is his comfort zone
[1:27:25] because he didn't bother me to go buy a
[1:27:26] beer in the store or the one
[1:27:28] in the restaurant why because they
[1:27:30] weren't born again i had a familiar
[1:27:32] spirit like they did
[1:27:34] so birds of a feather flock together but
[1:27:35] here's this guy
[1:27:37] he you'd see this he's got
[1:27:41] two 24 packs
[1:27:44] a bud light because it's in blue
[1:27:49] he comes out the door and he pushes the
[1:27:51] door open and i'm getting gas you know i
[1:27:53] look he's got him right here and and he
[1:27:56] has to walk
[1:27:57] sorry he has to walk like this because
[1:28:00] he don't have nothing to pull his pants
[1:28:02] up with
[1:28:03] so he's walking and i thought what an
[1:28:05] effort
[1:28:08] he just spent 40 dollars
[1:28:11] to get drunk and probably destroy
[1:28:14] something
[1:28:15] marriage somebody's property say
[1:28:17] something he ain't gonna
[1:28:18] want doesn't want to say you hear what
[1:28:20] i'm saying
[1:28:22] this is normal though and he can't pull
[1:28:25] his i mean his are down to here
[1:28:26] and he's going out to the car and i
[1:28:29] thought dude
[1:28:33] that's normal you know his friends are
[1:28:35] going whoa
[1:28:36] he carried beard he can't be pans pulled
[1:28:39] up
[1:28:40] that's normal but that is to them
[1:28:45] and then here you go up and pay for your
[1:28:47] gas and get you a coke or whatever in a
[1:28:48] pack of crackers or something
[1:28:50] and then you say god bless you and the
[1:28:52] guy behind the counter i almost have a
[1:28:53] heart attack
[1:28:57] because mostly they'll look at you and
[1:28:58] go what god you talking about that's
[1:29:00] right

[1:31:52] i used to do i mean by not just studying
[1:31:55] more and
[1:31:56] praying more and but you know what god
[1:31:58] knows that that's why i'm going to read
[1:31:59] to you in just a little bit when i get
[1:32:01] to it
[1:32:01] that's why god has to put us through
[1:32:03] this yes
[1:32:06] amen yes he knows what you need as an
[1:32:10] individual
[1:32:11] if you're a child of god and your
[1:32:14] footsteps are ordered the lord
[1:32:15] brother zach don't look at what some
[1:32:17] other brother's having to go through
[1:32:19] you look at what you got to go through
[1:32:21] everybody look at what you got to go
[1:32:23] through because it's an individual
[1:32:24] affair with god
[1:32:27] i will bear the indignation of the lord
[1:32:29] that's what i said before that's what
[1:32:30] we're bearing

[1:33:26] judgment
[1:33:26] for me he will bring me forth to the
[1:33:30] light
[1:33:30] and i shall behold his righteousness
[1:33:33] then she that is mine enemy shall see it
[1:33:36] and shame folks let me tell you
[1:33:38] something
[1:33:39] the most shameful people are going to be
[1:33:41] is is that person that shamed you down
[1:33:43] here
[1:33:45] and they're going to stand before the
[1:33:46] judgment bar and they're going to have
[1:33:48] to look at you
[1:33:52] because remember you didn't shame the
[1:33:53] lord oh yeah you did
[1:33:55] but you shamed the lord through that
[1:33:58] person
[1:34:00] wow then she that is mine enemy shall
[1:34:03] see it and shame shall cover her which
[1:34:05] said unto me
[1:34:06] where is the lord thy god
[1:34:10] in other words people ask well why
[1:34:13] why we're we're supposed to be this
[1:34:14] great christian you know bride of jesus
[1:34:17] christ why in the world
[1:34:18] are we getting this dreaded disease
[1:34:22] it's for mine and your perfection can't
[1:34:25] come no other way
[1:34:27] won't come no other way it's what you're
[1:34:29] going to do with it
[1:34:30] it's what's going to determine your
[1:34:35] journey it's your it's the journey
[1:34:38] that's right
[1:34:39] okay mine eyes shall behold her
[1:34:42] now shall she be trodden down as the
[1:34:45] mire
[1:34:46] of the streets how many times we read
[1:34:47] that scripture where it said they're
[1:34:49] talking about satan that he would be
[1:34:52] just something laying on the side of the
[1:34:53] road
[1:34:54] and we're going to look down and say is
[1:34:55] this the man that wrought destruction on
[1:34:58] kingdoms
[1:34:59] that gave me all that torment
[1:35:03] that's what we're gonna and listen i
[1:35:05] believe we're gonna look on him now
[1:35:07] right amen because
[1:35:10] that is the last enemy
[1:35:14] is death physical death is the last
[1:35:17] enemy we got to defeat
[1:35:20] and where does that come from satan it
[1:35:21] doesn't come from god
[1:35:23] that's what brother dale was talking
[1:35:25] about and i was writing i was getting
[1:35:26] quotes and we might get to them we might
[1:35:28] not so
[1:35:30] so let's go to the first quote listen to
[1:35:32] what brother brown said in the smyrna
[1:35:34] church
[1:35:34] everybody all right say amen all right
[1:35:37] just a little bit of encouragement here
[1:35:39] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:35:41] reign with him oh brother
[1:35:43] what him well he's reading the bible he
[1:35:46] can't
[1:35:46] he's reading what the bible says all
[1:35:48] right unless we suffer with him we
[1:35:50] cannot reign with him
[1:35:51] you have to suffer to reign now you say
[1:35:54] oh now
[1:35:55] god is no he knows if he lets you go
[1:36:00] what you'll do
[1:36:04] he's a good daddy but he's a just daddy
[1:36:10] you have to suffer the rain the reason
[1:36:12] for this
[1:36:13] is that character simply is never
[1:36:16] made without suffering
[1:36:20] you got to have an enemy gotta have one
[1:36:23] right got to have the two spirits you
[1:36:25] got to have the enemy yes
[1:36:28] but the enemy just doesn't know that
[1:36:29] god's using that enemy to push you
[1:36:31] closer to god not closer to the enemy
[1:36:33] if you're a child of god character is a
[1:36:37] victory
[1:36:38] not a gift so god's not just going to
[1:36:40] give you a gift of character
[1:36:44] it's a victory something you want he
[1:36:46] that overcometh
[1:36:47] a man without character can't reign
[1:36:49] because power apart from character is
[1:36:52] satanic
[1:36:53] have you ever thought about this god is
[1:36:55] all-knowing
[1:36:57] he has no limit right
[1:37:01] if god doesn't have character
[1:37:05] look what he could do he'd just destroy
[1:37:09] us all
[1:37:11] he could do whatever he wanted right he
[1:37:14] still can
[1:37:15] but he doesn't want to his character
[1:37:18] forbids him
[1:37:22] because satan has no character so he
[1:37:24] just kills everything he sees
[1:37:25] right perverts and in that way it dies
[1:37:29] a man without character can't reign so
[1:37:30] now if you and i have the mind of christ
[1:37:32] supposed to be having the mind
[1:37:34] of christ we're supposed to be having
[1:37:36] the character that is the character of
[1:37:38] god right there
[1:37:40] then how are we to act the same way
[1:37:46] power apart from character is satanic
[1:37:48] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:37:50] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:37:52] throne he's talking about revelation 3
[1:37:56] about us sitting in the throne
[1:38:00] on the same basis that he overcome and
[1:38:01] has set down with his father's throne
[1:38:03] that we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:38:07] all right see they didn't know he's in
[1:38:09] church don't they
[1:38:11] and say and since he wanted to share
[1:38:13] even a strong a little temporary look
[1:38:16] a little temporary suffering we go
[1:38:18] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:38:21] to the tremendous glory that be
[1:38:24] will be revealed in us when he comes
[1:38:27] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:38:29] who are willing to enter into his
[1:38:31] kingdom
[1:38:32] through much tribulation
[1:38:35] thinking not strange concerning the
[1:38:36] fiery trials that detroit you
[1:38:38] that is what peter said is it strange
[1:38:41] that god wants us to develop a
[1:38:42] christ-like character that comes through
[1:38:44] suffering
[1:38:44] no sir we all have trials we are all
[1:38:47] tried and chastened as sons
[1:38:49] not one but goes through it amen
[1:38:53] so we're not immune folks the church
[1:38:56] that is not suffering now this one's
[1:38:58] hard to swallow
[1:39:00] the church that is not suffering and is
[1:39:03] not being tried
[1:39:05] it isn't of god
[1:39:10] we believe our prophet now no we believe
[1:39:12] what he said good about us back yonder
[1:39:13] yo
[1:39:15] no the church that is not suffering and
[1:39:17] is not being tried
[1:39:18] hasn't got it it isn't of god
[1:39:22] whoa all right keep going hebrews 12
[1:39:26] 6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:39:28] and score just every son whom he
[1:39:30] receiveth
[1:39:31] but if you be without chastisement
[1:39:33] whereof all
[1:39:34] are partakers no one's excluded
[1:39:38] then you're bastards and not
[1:39:42] sons now this special condition in
[1:39:46] smyrna must be applied to
[1:39:47] every age there is no age free from it
[1:39:51] there is no true believer free from it
[1:39:54] this is of god this is the will of god
[1:39:58] keep reading it is needful
[1:40:02] we need the lord to teach us the truth
[1:40:04] that we are to suffer and be christ-like
[1:40:06] in doing it
[1:40:07] love suffereth long and is kind he goes
[1:40:11] to matthew 5
[1:40:12] 11. blessed are you when men shall
[1:40:15] revile you
[1:40:16] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:40:18] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:40:20] my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding
[1:40:22] glad for great is your reward in heaven
[1:40:27] we're so persecuted they the prophets
[1:40:30] which were before you
[1:40:33] this is where i want to come here i may
[1:40:34] just close right here and i'll pick up
[1:40:36] the rest later bro joe just hang on i've
[1:40:38] got many many scriptures that we'll read
[1:40:39] but let's just read this and we'll close
[1:40:41] 11 40 now the cloudy skies
[1:40:45] and storms of life are no sign of god's
[1:40:49] disapproval
[1:40:50] you can't measure what's going on in
[1:40:54] your daily life
[1:40:56] by that
[1:41:00] that is not a measure
[1:41:04] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:41:06] no signs of god's disapproval
[1:41:09] neither when you get up in the morning
[1:41:11] and the birds are singing and a
[1:41:13] butterfly lands on your finger when you
[1:41:14] go outside
[1:41:16] and you think oh the lord is with me
[1:41:18] today i got so much anointing on me so
[1:41:21] nothing can bother me
[1:41:22] you go get in your car and you go whoa
[1:41:30] are you getting going down the road cass
[1:41:32] in your motor goes boom
[1:41:33] four thousand dollars worth but you
[1:41:35] still got that butterfly on your finger
[1:41:41] neither are bright skies and still
[1:41:43] waters signs of his love and approval
[1:41:47] what do we got to base it on right here
[1:41:49] his approval
[1:41:51] of any of us is only
[1:41:54] in the beloved who is he that's jesus
[1:41:56] christ his
[1:41:57] love is elective which he had for us
[1:42:01] before the foundation of the world
[1:42:03] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[1:42:06] know
[1:42:08] we shall know because he said so
[1:42:14] not the cloudy skies not the sunny days
[1:42:20] not the trials that we're going through
[1:42:21] now all the different things
[1:42:24] but how shall we know we shall know
[1:42:26] because he said so
[1:42:28] and manifested that he did love us for
[1:42:31] he brought us
[1:42:32] to himself you ought to be so glad of
[1:42:35] that
[1:42:36] that that takes care of everything else
[1:42:37] that you're going through
[1:42:40] and gave us of his spirit placing us his
[1:42:44] sons
[1:42:45] and how shall i prove my love to him
[1:42:48] by believing what he said and conducting
[1:42:52] myself
[1:42:53] with what anger
[1:42:57] no and conduct by conducting myself
[1:43:00] with joy amidst the trials that he
[1:43:04] in his wisdom allows
[1:43:09] to come to pass what a quote
[1:43:13] what a quote
[1:43:16] i want to read this one more if you'll
[1:43:18] take this quote down to the layout to
[1:43:19] see in church age brother joe just go
[1:43:21] scroll through that go down let's read
[1:43:22] this one and then we'll finish i love
[1:43:23] this one all right look
[1:43:25] this is us to him that overcometh will i
[1:43:27] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:43:29] as i am overcome and i'm sitting down
[1:43:30] with my father he had to overcome too
[1:43:33] jesus christ had to overcome the devil
[1:43:35] just like you and i do
[1:43:38] hello
[1:43:41] and did you do it with signs and wonders
[1:43:43] no he told the devil what the bible
[1:43:45] already said
[1:43:48] to him that overcometh while grant has
[1:43:49] sit with me in my throne in not on
[1:43:52] even as i also overcome and i'm sitting
[1:43:54] down with my father in his throne
[1:43:56] now what are we to overcome we'll stop
[1:43:58] right here all right
[1:43:59] what are we to overcome that is the
[1:44:01] normal question to ask here
[1:44:04] why does the healing rage why do i have
[1:44:06] to get up and
[1:44:07] and say my prayers and if i gotta listen
[1:44:10] to one more tape today no it should be a
[1:44:12] joy for that to happen
[1:44:15] that's what lights your fire not turning
[1:44:17] on the news and watching
[1:44:20] the liar's channel and all them other
[1:44:21] things
[1:44:26] i mean come on you're gonna sit and
[1:44:28] listen to a lie for an hour and then
[1:44:30] instead of listening to a tape or listen
[1:44:32] to or listen to
[1:44:34] or read your bible that's life
[1:44:38] to me that's normal
[1:44:41] it should be normal for you
[1:44:44] now that is not the actual thought of
[1:44:46] this verse
[1:44:48] for it is not so much what we are to
[1:44:50] overcome
[1:44:51] but how we overcome it
[1:44:55] remember i always talked about a laundry
[1:44:56] list don't write a laundry list
[1:44:59] because you're going to be going well i
[1:45:00] don't do this i don't do that i do this
[1:45:01] i don't do that
[1:45:02] god don't love me because of this uh god
[1:45:04] i did this somebody did that
[1:45:06] no it's not it's not what you overcome
[1:45:11] it's how you overcome it
[1:45:15] now this is logical for does it matter
[1:45:18] much what we are to overcome as long as
[1:45:21] we know how we overcome it
[1:45:25] wow a quick look of those scriptures
[1:45:27] which involve the lord jesus overcoming
[1:45:29] will bring out
[1:45:30] the truth of this proposition
[1:45:33] in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of
[1:45:35] the devil he overcame the personal
[1:45:37] temptations of satan
[1:45:38] what by the word and by the word only
[1:45:42] in each of three major trials that
[1:45:44] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[1:45:47] of the garden of eden remember the lust
[1:45:48] of the
[1:45:49] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[1:45:50] of life anybody got that
[1:45:55] remember it's in two spirits in the
[1:45:56] beginning it's them two spirits standing
[1:45:58] here right now
[1:46:00] in this and then us look this one i want
[1:46:04] you to read
[1:46:05] he fell to the personal temptation
[1:46:09] of satan by failing to use the word
[1:46:15] okay second eve what are we supposed to
[1:46:17] do then use the word
[1:46:19] we're the second eve right first he fell
[1:46:21] by not using the word
[1:46:24] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[1:46:27] word
[1:46:29] but jesus overcame by the word
[1:46:33] and right now let me say this that that
[1:46:35] is the only way to be an overcomer
[1:46:38] also it is the only way that you can
[1:46:40] know if you're an
[1:46:41] overcomer because that word can't fail
[1:46:45] now notice again how jesus overcame the
[1:46:47] world systems of religion
[1:46:49] and here we talk about the two spirits
[1:46:50] two religious spirits now
[1:46:52] when he was repeatedly badgered
[1:46:56] we think we have problems listen they
[1:46:59] hated jesus
[1:47:01] they didn't even want him around they
[1:47:02] didn't want him in the synagogue they
[1:47:04] hate him so much they killed him
[1:47:05] you're right i really would like
[1:47:08] somebody to hate me that good
[1:47:14] why didn't you say he's like jesus
[1:47:18] if we don't get persecuted like jesus
[1:47:20] did then i don't know that we're of
[1:47:22] jesus
[1:47:22] that's what he's saying when he was
[1:47:24] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[1:47:26] of his day
[1:47:27] he constantly applied the word he
[1:47:30] spake only what the father gave him to
[1:47:32] speak there was not a time when the
[1:47:35] world was not
[1:47:36] utterly confused boy
[1:47:40] by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of
[1:47:43] god what are you and i supposed to have
[1:47:46] faith virtue knowledge
[1:47:49] temperance patience godliness
[1:47:53] and the love of god which is agape love
[1:47:56] they were not a time when the world was
[1:47:58] not utterly confused
[1:48:00] that's the same thing they are with us
[1:48:01] when they question us as they're if
[1:48:02] they're they're in a confusion
[1:48:04] musicians come they're in a confusion
[1:48:08] they're confused that well this this
[1:48:10] this is normal
[1:48:12] listen even the religious
[1:48:15] realm of people if you even meet a real
[1:48:18] good nominal christian
[1:48:20] and you start talking to them about
[1:48:22] water baptism
[1:48:24] or about no eternal hell or about all
[1:48:26] these great doctrines that we've been
[1:48:28] re that's been revealed to us they think
[1:48:31] you're strange
[1:48:34] not just in people out there that smoke
[1:48:35] and drink and don't go to church i'm
[1:48:36] talking about church people
[1:48:38] i'm talking about people that walk
[1:48:39] around they go to church and have on
[1:48:41] their you know the
[1:48:42] women they have women preachers in their
[1:48:43] congregation are in their pulpits and
[1:48:45] all that which
[1:48:46] is totally contrary to the word of god
[1:48:49] amen so see
[1:48:52] as we get closer can we be
[1:48:57] in the ranks of the message the same way
[1:49:01] because we teach daniel 70 weeks the way
[1:49:03] it's supposed to be taught i'm just
[1:49:05] going to be truthful here
[1:49:06] the seals daniel 70 weeks the great
[1:49:08] doctrines has been preached from this
[1:49:09] church and been
[1:49:10] preached in truth the people in the
[1:49:13] message do the same thing to us
[1:49:16] oh be careful don't don't let them in
[1:49:18] your pulpit they may
[1:49:19] they may preach something that yeah
[1:49:24] yeah when you got preachers in this
[1:49:25] message that has a sign in their office
[1:49:27] that says please don't preach on
[1:49:28] marriage and divorce we got a problem
[1:49:33] and that's the truth i haven't seen it
[1:49:35] but i've seen people that have seen it
[1:49:38] so what are we up against now we're up
[1:49:39] against the two spirits now that's so
[1:49:41] close
[1:49:44] that it's your idea it's what's gonna
[1:49:47] kill you
[1:49:49] listen god don't have ideas oh i got
[1:49:52] this idea
[1:49:53] oh he's already got it as soon as he
[1:49:55] thinks it it becomes manifest
[1:49:58] the devil has to think through these
[1:50:00] things i'm sure he does
[1:50:02] because he's not a god you know satan is
[1:50:05] not
[1:50:08] i'm going to say this satan is not as
[1:50:12] much of god as you are
[1:50:14] if you've got god in your soul
[1:50:20] you have a creator inside of you that by
[1:50:23] your
[1:50:24] own voice you can create satan cannot do
[1:50:27] that
[1:50:31] i mean how many up listen how many of us
[1:50:32] let's stand to our feet how many of us
[1:50:34] think
[1:50:34] all right here's god now we know there's
[1:50:36] just one there's not three of them
[1:50:37] sitting up there
[1:50:38] there's one god then here's the devil
[1:50:41] and then here's us
[1:50:47] god don't see it that way
[1:50:52] he created the devil
[1:50:55] and the devil went wrong now you and i
[1:50:58] came because of that wrong
[1:51:00] but he created us in that genesis 1 26
[1:51:03] man and satan
[1:51:04] does not understand that and cannot
[1:51:06] touch that
[1:51:08] because that is god a peace of god
[1:51:13] satan is not a peace of god no
[1:51:16] he's a created being he's not even human
[1:51:18] brother brahms he's not a human
[1:51:21] he can't create where does he get his
[1:51:24] power
[1:51:25] from fear and being your enemy
[1:51:30] but let me tell you when we finish this
[1:51:31] next sunday you'll see
[1:51:33] that enemy is what's driving you
[1:51:38] to the homeland the two hundred thousand
[1:51:41] thousand demons that got in eichmann and
[1:51:42] hitler them same demons when eichmann
[1:51:44] and hitler died
[1:51:45] they came on me and you through
[1:51:47] persecution of government and
[1:51:49] everything else and even somebody even
[1:51:51] your neighbor
[1:51:53] but what brother brown say he said it'll
[1:51:55] drive you to your homeland
[1:51:59] which is this message of the hour
[1:52:02] to me then we can be settled
[1:52:06] come what may we
[1:52:09] will win
[1:52:12] we will overcome we will win
[1:52:17] and i didn't get to i didn't get to the
[1:52:19] part where dad and i were talking about
[1:52:20] talking about death
[1:52:22] but even now you know death's all around
[1:52:24] us
[1:52:26] it's just become a normal thing
[1:52:31] so when it comes up to me and you what
[1:52:33] are we going to do
[1:52:38] because it's always that great big enemy
[1:52:39] it's that great big goliath it's that
[1:52:41] thing that stands up that really when
[1:52:42] death comes up you really can't see
[1:52:44] nowhere
[1:52:46] it's just all around you but remember
[1:52:49] yea though i walk through the valley
[1:52:53] of the shadow of death i will fear
[1:52:57] no evil because i'm looking at the light
[1:53:01] i'm not looking at the shadow because
[1:53:04] remember what is a shadow of shadows
[1:53:05] behind you
[1:53:07] if you got this if you got the s-o-n in
[1:53:09] front of you
[1:53:10] your shadow's back here
[1:53:14] put your cares on jesus yes i know this
[1:53:17] was
[1:53:17] simple but i it spoke to my heart the
[1:53:20] other day when we were talking about
[1:53:21] you walk through life and and we do as
[1:53:23] human beings and you know what
[1:53:25] don't have a pity party you're going to
[1:53:27] have one
[1:53:29] because you're human but don't have a
[1:53:30] long one
[1:53:33] shake yourself
[1:53:36] devil you're a liar god's word is the
[1:53:39] truth
[1:53:41] and just set your eyes toward home
[1:53:44] because that's what this is not our home
[1:53:46] yeah we're coming back to this but i'm
[1:53:47] talking about this cosmos this world
[1:53:49] order
[1:53:50] is not having it's nothing for a
[1:53:52] christian to be in
[1:53:54] but god has protected us though being in
[1:53:57] this age
[1:53:57] he has put a dome over us and protected
[1:54:00] us
[1:54:00] because you and i would go crazy
[1:54:04] literally crazy if we didn't know the
[1:54:06] truth
[1:54:08] that's why they're going crazy out there
[1:54:09] they don't know the truth well what's
[1:54:11] going to happen if i die
[1:54:12] i was thinking another day one of the
[1:54:13] greatest things is bro god let brother
[1:54:15] brown go across that curtain of time
[1:54:19] you know to me that destroyed death for
[1:54:21] him
[1:54:22] i know he had to physically die but that
[1:54:24] destroyed death because he know he said
[1:54:27] what am i afraid of i don't even want to
[1:54:30] go back there
[1:54:33] look which one was the greatest i will
[1:54:35] go back there
[1:54:36] right but he could come back and tell me
[1:54:39] and you
[1:54:40] don't fear that don't fear death
[1:54:44] that's just a tool to get you from here
[1:54:48] to god into your manifestation of who
[1:54:51] you are then you got to wait on somebody
[1:54:54] that's right somebody's got to stand one

[1:59:31] it in the name of jesus christ your own
[1:59:34] understanding that's your authority
[1:59:36] just lean on not just the anointing
[1:59:40] that's just a cloth but your mouth
[1:59:44] your confession you put that confession
[1:59:48] in the airwaves and see if god
[1:59:51] will not do what he said he would do
[1:59:55] lay it on there and pronounce it in the
[1:59:56] name of jesus christ
[1:59:58] satan hates that name
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:02] of jesus christ let's sing it now
[2:00:06] we have been made more than conquered
[2:00:11] you believe that
[2:00:14] overcomers in this life
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:19] oh we've been made victorious
[2:00:25] through the blood of jesus
[2:00:29] and guess what we had a prophet
[2:00:32] pronounced one day
[2:00:34] he said the bride is the blood
[2:00:38] by the spirit so that blood
[2:00:41] that covering we have become that
[2:00:45] the bride is the blood by the spirit so
[2:00:48] by the spirit of god that's inside of
[2:00:50] you
[2:00:50] listen it wasn't the physical blood that
[2:00:52] saves you the physical blood just kind
[2:00:55] of went down into the ground and it's
[2:00:56] kind of gone
[2:00:58] but the life the power
[2:01:02] that laid in the life that flowed
[2:01:04] through that blood
[2:01:05] that's what you need to accept
[2:01:08] but the bride is the blood by the spirit
[2:01:12] what a quote think about that
[2:01:17] that might says can't vote
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:21] where's the dna come from yep you say oh
[2:01:23] no it comes from
[2:01:24] a hat your hair is what makes you look i
[2:01:27] mean your blood what makes your hair
[2:01:29] your blood's a lifeline right without
[2:01:31] your blood you don't have anything
[2:01:33] but that life in that blood it's the
[2:01:36] life behind
[2:01:38] that makes the demon tremble
[2:01:42] satan thought he had him he had him
[2:01:43] hanging on a cross the blood was coming
[2:01:45] out of his body
[2:01:46] but he just didn't know that he released
[2:01:51] the most powerful force that had ever
[2:01:54] been released that somebody said let
[2:01:56] there be
[2:01:59] because he released it out of that shell
[2:02:04] and the first thing satan knew he was
[2:02:05] standing looking at him face to face
[2:02:08] satan says what are you doing down here
[2:02:11] he said well i just paid a price
[2:02:16] and i've come to claim what's mine
[2:02:20] give me the keys
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:23] give me the keys and while i'm at it i'm
[2:02:26] going to stop by paradise and all them
[2:02:28] that died in faith
[2:02:30] i'm going to take them with me satan you
[2:02:33] don't even know where i'm taking them
[2:02:36] and on the day of pentecost there was
[2:02:38] 120 little jesus is born and satan's
[2:02:40] going crazy and been going crazy ever
[2:02:42] since
[2:02:45] he has no power unless god allows him
[2:02:48] and if god allows him it's for your
[2:02:51] benefit
[2:02:53] i'll read it next sunday it's for your
[2:02:54] benefit when god releases the devil on
[2:02:57] you
[2:02:59] because satan thinks he's going to turn
[2:03:01] you some way he's going to try to turn
[2:03:03] you
[2:03:04] back to serving him but what is there
[2:03:07] there's an anchor
[2:03:10] there's something in there satan cannot
[2:03:12] understand
[2:03:14] he can't understand why you can't go
[2:03:17] right back to what you were doing
[2:03:19] because he don't have that thing in him
[2:03:23] but you do you hold on to that trials
[2:03:26] tribulations
[2:03:28] whatever it is sickness death sorrow
[2:03:30] pain
[2:03:31] we got to go through it we must suffer
[2:03:34] the rain
[2:03:36] but you know what the reigning
[2:03:39] is for an eternity this mile that we're
[2:03:43] going through now
[2:03:44] it's just mild but that rain will be for
[2:03:49] an eternity and you'll never have to
[2:03:51] worry about sickness death sorrow pain
[2:03:54] no more
[2:03:58] that's why brother we were talking about
[2:04:00] you know you can't kill a christian
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:04] you can just separate him from this
[2:04:06] dimension but you can't kill a christian
[2:04:09] you're actually more alive when you're
[2:04:10] in a city like jesus jesus was trapped
[2:04:13] in the body
[2:04:13] like it was 50 years old but it was only
[2:04:15] 30 right
[2:04:17] but when he died on that cross and
[2:04:19] released that life
[2:04:21] there was that 20 year old god that
[2:04:23] satan said
[2:04:25] didn't i meet you back
[2:04:29] where are we didn't you create me or we
[2:04:32] he's looking at that 20 year old guy
[2:04:34] again
[2:04:36] the creator that's why you and i are
[2:04:40] gonna be changed back to a young man and
[2:04:42] woman because jesus
[2:04:43] our god has always been a young man
[2:04:46] because we were created in his image not
[2:04:48] this image we were created in his image
[2:04:50] so
[2:04:51] you're right now we're all the same age
[2:04:56] 18 20 years old inside of you
[2:04:59] it's what's going to carry you out of
[2:05:02] here
[2:05:03] if you don't have it in you folks it's
[2:05:05] not going to carry you
[2:05:08] you're going to you're going to suffer a
[2:05:09] worse fate
[2:05:11] than you ever think a little bit of
[2:05:12] suffering of not doing this and not
[2:05:15] doing i can't go to do this and i can't
[2:05:17] have a beer with my friends
[2:05:18] come on people
[2:05:22] just hold on hold on
[2:05:26] hold on to god forget about the world
[2:05:30] hold on to what god said
[2:05:34] because listen if you grab a hold of
[2:05:36] satan's hand you know where he's going
[2:05:38] to take you
[2:05:39] he's going to take you to hell he can't
[2:05:41] take you anywhere else
[2:05:43] he'll start with hell on earth and he'll
[2:05:44] take you to hell in that other dimension
[2:05:47] but if you hang on to god
[2:05:51] i like what a preacher said one time he
[2:05:52] said we have attached ourself to the
[2:05:55] eternal
[2:05:57] amen and that's what it is we've
[2:05:59] attached ourselves to the eternal
[2:06:01] so how can we lose we can't lose god
[2:06:04] bless you let's buy our hands still
[2:06:05] heavenly father thank you for this day
