[3:52] [Music]
[3:54] we've been in this scripture now for
[3:56] quite a while
[3:59] but we'll finally get around to the end
[4:02] of it one of these days you know let's
[4:05] just go over to verse twenty-two and
[4:09] twenty-three as we're reading in first
[4:12] Peter says seeing you have purified your
[4:15] souls and obeying the truth through the
[4:17] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[4:20] Brethren see that you love one another
[4:22] with a pure heart fervently being born
[4:25] again not of corruptible seed but of the
[4:29] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[4:32] liveth and abideth for ever now we go
[4:35] over to 2nd Peter now remember what we
[4:37] brought out Sunday though now you say
[4:40] well worried is it that we hear so much
[4:42] about the new birth is the birth of the
[4:44] word well not right there plainly tells
[4:45] you that you're being born again by the
[4:48] incorruptible Word of God which liveth
[4:52] and abideth forever so that that should
[4:55] be enough for you two to know and
[4:57] understand all right now we'll go to 2nd
[5:02] Peter 1 Simon Peter servant an apostle
[5:07] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[5:08] obtained like precious faith with us
[5:10] through the righteousness of God and our
[5:13] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[5:15] multiplied unto you through the
[5:17] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[5:19] according as his divine power hath given
[5:22] unto us all things that pertain unto
[5:24] life and godliness through the knowledge
[5:27] of him that have called us to glory and
[5:30] virtue whereby are given unto us
[5:33] exceeding great and precious promises
[5:36] that by these you might might be
[5:39] partakers of the divine nature having
[5:42] escaped the corruption that is in the
[5:43] world through lust and beside this
[5:45] giving all diligence add to your faith
[5:48] virtue and then a virtue or knowledge
[5:51] you may be seated the Lord that is
[5:53] blessing to the reading of the word now
[5:56] I pray that maybe some of you miss the
[6:01] Sunday services the morning service
[6:04] there I would ask you if you would to go
[6:07] back and listen to that service
[6:11] because I've listened to it
[6:13] two-and-a-half times so far and you know
[6:17] I had a point trying to get it in mind
[6:20] to each and every one of us all right
[6:24] see the prophet of God now don't
[6:27] misunderstand me and think I'm saying
[6:29] well he didn't do this he knew just
[6:30] listen the prophet of God never came to
[6:34] tell us it was wrong to drink and smoke
[6:37] and Gamble to run around with women and
[6:39] cuss and he didn't have to do that the
[6:43] new birth was supposed to take care of
[6:47] those things we see that we wait and in
[6:50] commercial well I didn't know it was
[6:52] wrong to do that well you know
[6:55] all right the in fact settles it you
[6:57] just you're that far off on your
[7:00] thinking then you know there's no need
[7:04] of even discussing that with you but
[7:05] trying to get a point to you now we
[7:08] didn't consider a lot of things I tried
[7:10] to emphasize that Sunday some of the
[7:13] things that the Prophet said we didn't
[7:16] consider those things maybe we didn't
[7:21] think about those things maybe because
[7:23] we were not told they were wrong
[7:25] by the preachers etc and things like
[7:29] that you know so we went along with
[7:31] those things you know and and you'd be
[7:34] back during the Baptists and I well
[7:36] remember they preached pretty heavily in
[7:38] the 50s and on into 65 and coming on
[7:42] through there with us
[7:43] there was against drinking but there was
[7:47] although you know it's okay to smoke
[7:49] uh-huh we'll see you can say well I
[7:52] didn't know what's wrong do this do that
[7:53] well all right then the Prophet came now
[7:56] you have no excuse so there's no
[7:58] argument about the point the point is
[8:01] that the Prophet didn't have to tell us
[8:04] a lot of things the new birth is
[8:07] supposed to take care of that you don't
[8:09] have to say well give me a quote where
[8:11] the Prophet said is wrong to drink you
[8:13] know that's where you're getting in to
[8:16] the point of just being plumb
[8:18] outlandishly silly because you're to
[8:22] know that with the the way it was and I
[8:24] was what I was trying to get across
[8:25] Sunday because I believe the new birth
[8:29] is the birth of the word that you
[8:32] receive and that birth brings you to as
[8:37] we read of the Prophet to the very
[8:41] divine nature of Almighty God in the
[8:45] basis that it brings the life of Christ
[8:47] within you in the new birth it puts the
[8:52] person of Jesus Christ in you in the new
[8:55] birth and it can be called the divine
[8:58] nature because it's taking away your
[8:59] nature and bringing in his nature
[9:03] cleansing us by that new birth
[9:06] all right then in growth development
[9:09] sure as we go along and we'll get on
[9:12] into this later
[9:13] you know the divine nature of God that
[9:16] it takes all of these virtues to bring
[9:19] in to us the divine nature of God all
[9:23] right so then that should solve the
[9:25] problem that we can look at it and it's
[9:27] look it is like that what we've read
[9:30] being born again now you when you've got
[9:35] the new birth you were being born again
[9:38] it was a process if you were going
[9:41] through through justification
[9:43] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[9:45] Ghost you were in a process of being
[9:47] which means it's a stage or a journey or
[9:51] something coming all right but then
[9:54] after you receive the baptism of the
[9:55] Holy Ghost the new birth then you come
[9:59] to the basis of what is it now
[10:02] being born again being born again is a
[10:09] process in the stature of a perfect man
[10:12] all right and that's what we've tried to
[10:15] express and I'm trying to move on into
[10:18] getting the understanding that what
[10:22] we're looking at sea is the stature of a
[10:25] perfect man in 2nd Peter it's not
[10:28] telling you there about you know that
[10:32] you need to be born again that should be
[10:34] settled in the basis of the new birth
[10:38] of faith as we'll get to in a minute and
[10:41] reading some the Prophet had to say all
[10:43] right but it's that is a growth
[10:45] development in the second Peter to try
[10:48] to get us to a place that we need to be
[10:51] in Christ Jesus
[10:53] all right now it'll take those virtues
[10:56] to bring us to the place and people
[10:58] would say well why are we still here
[11:00] and after all these years and a prophet
[11:03] gone because we haven't been taught the
[11:06] correct way the people of the message
[11:08] haven't listened they won't pay
[11:10] attention to what you're saying they
[11:12] just run off with some quote or an idea
[11:15] and I got a quote for this you know and
[11:16] they'll just give you what you can give
[11:18] a quote for anything you want to
[11:20] anything you say I can give you from
[11:24] memory probably a quote from the Prophet
[11:27] that would seem totally opposite from
[11:30] what he's saying all right but that
[11:33] can't be true and see then my point that
[11:37] I've tried to get you to see is a growth
[11:40] development you've got to be born again
[11:44] the born-again experience it takes
[11:48] justification chopping off you PI sins
[11:51] it takes sanctification the unclean
[11:55] spirit being driven out and it's driven
[11:57] out by the word coming and indwelling to
[12:00] drive out that out of your soul now not
[12:03] out of your body and spirit because the
[12:05] Newburg don't take place in the body in
[12:07] spirit it takes place in your soul all
[12:10] right so you drive out that unclean
[12:12] spirit then the Holy Spirit can come in
[12:15] and dwell into our hearts giving us the
[12:19] new birth all right but that makes us
[12:21] babies as the Bible called it desiring
[12:25] the sincere milk of the word that we may
[12:27] grow thereby that's where the Prophet
[12:29] told it well just reading our minute ago
[12:31] he said that's where you Pentecostals
[12:33] messed up said you thought the new birth
[12:35] was the inner he said that's just the
[12:37] beginning
[12:38] you know the new birth is just the
[12:40] beginning it's not the ending it's not
[12:42] you got everything and it's all settled
[12:45] you know no no it's just the beginning
[12:47] you just got into the family of God
[12:50] by the new birth you just become born
[12:53] again you become a Christian
[12:55] alright see then the Prophet would come
[12:58] along and even all through his life
[13:00] would be teaching things that would
[13:03] sound like that he's contrary one to the
[13:06] other and he talked about the baptism of
[13:09] the holy ghost and the new birth is
[13:11] maybe being different you know you said
[13:15] well if you go back and take those
[13:18] things and study them out and listen
[13:21] you'd find out that the new birth is
[13:24] bringing us into the body of Christ
[13:27] justification sanctification baptism
[13:29] with old ago new birth brings us into
[13:32] Christ into the kingdom of God but we're
[13:35] babies alright then the Holy Ghost
[13:38] itself coming to be our very tutor our
[13:42] leader our God and everything to help us
[13:45] grow in the development of Christianity
[13:49] all right and then we'll get back to
[13:51] these more later as we cover it that is
[13:56] a told you over and over Peter and
[13:59] second Peter is telling you how to
[14:02] attain unto where he was this is address
[14:06] to what those that are in Christ Jesus
[14:09] not address to the world not address to
[14:12] everything it's addressed to those that
[14:14] are in Christ Jesus because only those
[14:17] in Christ Jesus can understand what
[14:19] Peter's saying because see Peter would
[14:22] say add to your faith virtue well no I'm
[14:26] a virgin I'm a virgin today so I've got
[14:31] that part straight down well the Prophet
[14:34] he said that ain't gonna do it no that's
[14:37] its wording he said that ain't that's
[14:39] what we think see we get the wrong you
[14:42] understand what I'm saying we get the
[14:44] wrong understanding of things instead of
[14:48] trying to listen to what the Prophet is
[14:50] saying and all of those years he was
[14:52] trying to preach adoption and all of the
[14:56] things to the church to get him to see
[14:58] you know what was taking place to where
[15:01] they could be brought into the family
[15:03] tutored
[15:04] and raised and all like that coming to
[15:06] sonship all right see then it should be
[15:10] a help to you to understand what I've
[15:13] drove for the longest that Peter is
[15:16] telling you how to do this add to your
[15:21] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
[15:25] temperance patience godliness and your
[15:28] coming up the statue of a perfect man
[15:30] the growth growth development of
[15:33] Christianity within your being all right
[15:36] Paul comes over and tells you how that
[15:40] you're born into the family and you're
[15:43] just as much of a child as you'll ever
[15:45] be a child and then he's bringing you up
[15:48] through the tutor and the Holy Spirit
[15:50] being the razor and bringing you up to
[15:53] the position of adoption to where God
[15:56] can come on the scene and adopt his own
[15:59] son into the family all right
[16:01] see now to me that's a wonderful thing
[16:03] because that puts all of the Bible and
[16:07] the two main writers I like the way Wade
[16:12] was bringing it out the other day about
[16:13] Paul the Paul wrote the most biggest
[16:16] portion the New Testament you know and I
[16:19] guess Peter wrote maybe basically more
[16:21] than any of the rest of them you know so
[16:24] Peter and Paul is bringing us to trying
[16:27] to get us to see what God wants he wants
[16:31] a dwelling place he wants a body which
[16:34] we are the body of Christ by the new
[16:36] birth he wants that body dedicated to
[16:39] God to live for God and manifest God
[16:43] through the world that they can see and
[16:45] others that can follow in your footsteps
[16:48] all right see then that's what it all
[16:51] comes to bringing us to the the growth
[16:55] development of Christianity huh
[16:58] see then when a prophet would come along
[17:00] and he'd say is I bringing out Sunday
[17:02] you know he'd say ah you get everything
[17:05] you need when you're born again well
[17:06] that's right that's exactly right a baby
[17:11] gets everything it needs when it's born
[17:14] it don't grow no extra parts and limbs
[17:17] and legs
[17:18] whatever it's got everything it just
[17:20] needs a growth development we have the
[17:24] new birth the new birth is the person of
[17:28] Jesus Christ coming and dwelling within
[17:32] our soul to make our soul eternal
[17:35] bringing us his nature his ways and
[17:38] things and in that then that new birth
[17:42] has got everything that we have need of
[17:45] but we need to grow we need to grow up
[17:51] in them as the Bible says alright see
[17:54] then that's what I've been driving at
[17:55] now trying to get you to four months and
[17:58] all driving that point of the new birth
[18:01] and the vital point of seeing what that
[18:05] new birth is alright then we've read it
[18:11] and they emphasize the last couple of
[18:13] messages about words talking about being
[18:15] born again by the incorruptible Word of
[18:17] God so you ought to see the new birth is
[18:20] the birth of the word and it's the
[18:23] incorruptible Word of God that will
[18:27] bring you in I up the stature of a
[18:29] perfect man okay we'll get back to those
[18:33] things later as we going on through the
[18:37] message but I've have reach to put
[18:39] position now to work that we're going to
[18:43] start tonight to looking at the growth
[18:46] development and that's what's wrong with
[18:49] the people of the message
[18:50] like I said Sunday this message is
[18:54] taught to her that it fits the Jews
[18:59] it fits the bride it even goes down and
[19:04] drops low enough to work with I'll use
[19:07] it like that of the foolish virgins and
[19:10] the different things you know all the
[19:13] realms of Christianity is involved in
[19:16] the Bible
[19:17] alright see then bringing all of those
[19:20] things together
[19:22] look we're how you would go off because
[19:26] I've always emphasized this when you
[19:29] talk about the second coming to Jesus
[19:30] cry
[19:31] you got the bride coming across coming
[19:33] out of the church you got him coming for
[19:35] the bride right you got him coming to
[19:39] Israel
[19:40] you got him coming into millennium and
[19:43] then you got his final coming to her
[19:46] that he would come to the Future home
[19:47] all in the second coming of Jesus Christ
[19:52] well then you take a quote from brother
[19:54] Branham and he's talking about the
[19:57] coming of Christ to the Jews and then
[20:01] you read that for yourself let's see
[20:03] you're out because that's not what is
[20:05] talking about to read it though to see
[20:08] that he's talking to the bride then he's
[20:10] not talking about Israel see we need to
[20:13] understand those things and then that
[20:17] way you won't be confused when you're
[20:19] reading in some writers don't understand
[20:22] how come he says easier like I told you
[20:27] about the two brothers I said and talked
[20:29] with one day and one of them said when
[20:31] he got morning in he's adopted he got
[20:34] everything no he said it the other one
[20:38] said well I did four we said of course
[20:42] you don't have nothing he said we just
[20:47] don't have nothing I said would you two
[20:49] guys mind if I stay in the middle
[20:51] cuz I certainly can't go with neither
[20:53] one other games because I know the new
[20:57] birth is eternal life that means you
[21:00] have something so this wouldn't be wrong
[21:03] saying you don't have nothing then this
[21:06] wouldn't be wrong to say you get
[21:07] everything when you believed because
[21:09] that wouldn't work out easy so you stay
[21:12] in the middle and you always and that's
[21:15] always been ever since I've been in this
[21:17] message we have the tapes back there at
[21:20] least - mm - and I probably got my notes
[21:26] I've got Evernote that I've ever sermon
[21:28] I've ever preached so if you want to go
[21:31] back sometimes and sister Johnny said
[21:33] one time said brother they'll let me
[21:35] take those notes you got and put them in
[21:38] to type them in put them in the computer
[21:41] I said well
[21:43] first all you've got all that second off
[21:46] you couldn't read what it said third off
[21:48] you wouldn't understand what was being
[21:50] said because of the way that I am and
[21:53] the way I say things and all you know
[21:55] like that but I've always it's always
[21:59] been since starting this message of
[22:04] knowing and seeing the stature of a
[22:06] perfect man is dealing with a growth
[22:09] development in Jesus Christ after you're
[22:13] born into the family by the new birth
[22:16] that's what it's always been
[22:18] that's that's what I've taught from from
[22:21] the very beginning because that was wet
[22:24] come brother mow preach statue a perfect
[22:26] man in 71 leave us right
[22:29] brother Colley 71 all right so you know
[22:33] it goes away on back you know and I
[22:37] thoroughly enjoyed those days of his
[22:39] teachings on those things all right but
[22:42] see a lot of people differed and says
[22:44] well we don't have this we don't have
[22:46] that that's nothing to me that's between
[22:50] you and God
[22:50] but when you come and tell me I don't
[22:53] have it
[22:54] these are night that does that changes
[22:57] things you tell me I'm not trying to
[23:00] convince nobody of anything I've never
[23:04] tried to convince anybody who I am or
[23:06] where I'm at or what's happening I've
[23:09] tried to preach Christ well but you can
[23:12] see then that would be almost 50 years
[23:17] if I'm say into the 70 71 you know it
[23:21] being 40 something years that I've been
[23:23] teaching the same thing got the tapes to
[23:27] prove it
[23:28] desire to hadn't changed and change this
[23:31] out of the other my change I'll tell you
[23:34] you'll be the first one to know if I
[23:37] miss something changed I've had to
[23:39] correct sometimes yeah I remember one
[23:43] thing I used to I used to think the
[23:45] fusing the theophany
[23:46] you had no feelings whatsoever you know
[23:50] I mean I believed that I believed you
[23:53] didn't have no feelings but then one day
[23:54] I read where the Prophet said you
[23:56] theophany you know you can faithlyn well
[23:59] that change that and you know what I
[24:00] don't I come here and told the church
[24:03] they were I was wrong and what the truth
[24:06] was about it I've always tried to be
[24:08] that away no trying to get it to you to
[24:10] see that I believe Peter was teaching us
[24:16] how to come to work he was which is when
[24:22] you'd look at the pyramid as you'd see
[24:24] where it says brotherly kindness and the
[24:27] Holy Spirit there on the pyramid all
[24:29] right now then showing that Peter says
[24:35] will you death he said but you're you're
[24:37] born again at faith and then your growth
[24:42] development is to going on into other
[24:45] thing which brother branham will bring
[24:47] it down and he said Christ coming down
[24:50] through God's Holy Spirit sealing all
[24:52] these things together Christ coming down
[24:55] through God's Holy Spirit see you just
[24:57] go haywire but if you just listened to
[25:01] the Prophet he said that's what it's in
[25:04] the stature of a perfect man I know one
[25:06] time I think it's twice he said I come
[25:09] to build individuals into this stature
[25:14] that's his purpose to build us in the
[25:17] stature
[25:18] alright now you understand what I'm
[25:20] saying about it and I'll get this and
[25:21] get over it see then that he didn't come
[25:24] to tell us what the new birth is that
[25:26] what he didn't have to come and tell us
[25:28] it was wrong to do this and to do that
[25:30] will denote it was wrong to do you
[25:33] didn't have to tell me it was wrong to
[25:35] cause I didn't have to when I come in
[25:41] this message I didn't have to find a
[25:42] whole bunch of things that I've been
[25:43] used to doing and get rid of them he
[25:48] said well you mean you throw school
[25:50] listen I just tell it like it is you're
[25:52] where you want to believe it or not I
[25:55] can go a long ways own if you want tall
[25:58] I never drank me a sinner
[26:00] I never cussed with me a sinner and
[26:08] ever had them bad habits and me a sinner
[26:14] well you believe that or not that's your
[26:16] business but I'm just trying to tell the
[26:19] truth that ain't bragging oh nothing but
[26:21] one thing that's why I believe the way I
[26:25] do that a human being a human being not
[26:30] even a born-again believer a human being
[26:33] has within that human being a soul and
[26:37] that soul motivates that person and it
[26:41] doesn't matter if he's a healer in
[26:42] Africa worshipping idols or if he's any
[26:45] kind of a worse than ancestry the reason
[26:48] that human soul within him is longing
[26:52] out for the God of creation because he
[26:59] that's what happened with me in my
[27:01] Christian life once I met God at 11
[27:06] years old there's never been a day since
[27:08] then and I didn't want to be more like
[27:09] that that I met I don't have to worry
[27:12] about that I've always told it I believe
[27:16] it I believe the soul the prophet said
[27:19] the soul of an individual what is it
[27:21] really
[27:22] basing it on the best you can want the
[27:24] soul of an individual is really a moral
[27:27] obligation that is within the human
[27:30] element that causes that human element
[27:34] to want to serve God no matter how what
[27:37] you're talking about your God is being
[27:39] there's a desire in there if you won't
[27:42] run around and we'll get into it he
[27:44] talked to me he said Moses had these he
[27:46] said every person born into the world
[27:48] had that same thing every person in the
[27:52] world has a drawing power to pull them
[27:57] pull us to a position if we just listen
[28:01] to it well what do we do we let the
[28:04] things of life we let those thing come
[28:06] and take over now don't you remember
[28:12] back in your early years for you started
[28:14] into a life of doing wrong don't you
[28:19] remember that there was a moral
[28:20] obligation of
[28:22] something within you that you didn't
[28:24] want to go do those things you didn't
[28:26] want to lie you didn't want to cheat and
[28:28] steal the time but you overrode it come
[28:36] on church you put your life there comes
[28:43] that's where my life's always been my
[28:46] life has always been one time an open
[28:51] book I don't well no closed pages in
[28:55] this man's life that's what my wife
[28:58] always says that you you always just
[28:59] tell everything too much that your nun
[29:01] tell I'm just open that's what I was
[29:06] trying to get at Sunday at one time the
[29:09] Prophet didn't have to come to tell us
[29:11] to live good and be good and to quit
[29:14] this and quit that even a moral
[29:20] obligation told you to do that
[29:22] but you claimed most of you claim to
[29:25] have been born again for you heard of
[29:26] the Prophet well then how come that Holy
[29:29] Spirit didn't direct you
[29:40] come on see I get into that and it goes
[29:42] and you you don't like it because you
[29:44] don't like to be talked to that way but
[29:47] I'm truthful and straight and have
[29:50] always been that I believe in being a
[29:54] Christian is the right life hey we all
[29:59] fail don't worry about it
[30:01] well we're about it you're gonna fail
[30:03] anyway cuz why would you to need an
[30:05] advocate why would you need a Savior why
[30:07] would you need a Oh God if if if you
[30:09] wouldn't don't fail you we're gonna do
[30:12] that but we don't have to do it
[30:13] voluntarily and for heaven's sake we
[30:17] don't have to really don't bother me to
[30:19] do that I can't find where the Prophet
[30:21] said it was wrong to drink
[30:26] you didn't need the Prophet to tell you
[30:31] okay I'll get off for Sunday's message
[30:33] all right now think about it so we've
[30:40] been studying now for quite a while
[30:42] about the new birth and the things
[30:44] trying to get it laid down for sure to
[30:48] understand that the new birth is the
[30:51] born to get experience of Jesus Christ
[30:55] to come and live in each one of us to
[30:59] give us his nature and it has to be if
[31:03] we're babes in Christ when we're born
[31:05] again then it's a baby nature what else
[31:07] would you say is there any other way of
[31:10] saying it I don't know because it would
[31:12] be a baby nature it wouldn't God would
[31:15] not expect you to do all of these things
[31:17] where do we get into the statue of a
[31:19] perfect man a little father when brother
[31:21] Ron said look here he said God waited
[31:26] all this way before we have to do this
[31:32] you think he don't understand this he
[31:36] waits all through our life for us to
[31:38] come to a place of understanding all
[31:41] right so didn't listen we become
[31:45] partakers of the divine nature by being
[31:48] born again brought into the family of
[31:50] God by the new birth
[31:52] then we start in that group development
[31:55] in that divine nature as that nature
[31:59] inside of us starts coming back outward
[32:02] into our body and spirit because you're
[32:04] not born to get in your body you're not
[32:06] born again in your spirit you're only
[32:07] born again in your soul all right now
[32:11] see then that becomes to the point that
[32:14] we then begin at the new birth now
[32:19] here's where we're starting tonight so
[32:20] listen we begin in the new birth and
[32:23] that new birth is faith in God right the
[32:31] new birth the birth of the word and we
[32:34] become partakers of his divine nature as
[32:37] the growth development of Christianity
[32:41] into our hearts and lives as we study
[32:43] the Word of God as we pray and we listen
[32:47] to the message you know and and all of
[32:50] those things because listen see then the
[32:53] Prophet didn't have to come to tell us
[32:55] we didn't wasn't supposed to drink again
[32:58] when smoke run around chromatid ultras
[33:00] that he come to give us a message that
[33:07] would bring us back to the faith of the
[33:08] father is that the message of the hour
[33:12] this message is to bring you and I to
[33:16] the divine nature of Almighty God within
[33:19] our human beings we see here is where
[33:22] we're at but I don't see it in you well
[33:27] you know what I always see it in you so
[33:29] now what we got we got a standoff we've
[33:34] got an argument a fuss between and what
[33:37] good is that you don't like my ways I
[33:45] don't like your ways but I've never
[33:49] decrease you not anybody on that basis I
[33:54] never tried to tell nobody they've lost
[33:56] because of their ways that's between you
[33:59] and God
[34:04] I've been totally misunderstood about
[34:07] the rims and the ways that I've took
[34:09] this message and brought it forward to
[34:11] the people but I'll be glad
[34:13] thanks God with what I've tried to bring
[34:15] because I've tried to bring it to a
[34:17] place that this message was to bring you
[34:20] and I to the place that we could have a
[34:24] bodily change that was prophesied in the
[34:28] Bible but was never attained untrue by
[34:32] anyone now you can go back to Enoch but
[34:34] you got a lot to remember with him and
[34:36] the things like that walking off the
[34:39] earth all right
[34:40] but then Church listen Peter tells us in
[34:48] his writing that we've read first one
[34:53] our second Peter verse one through five
[34:55] he's told us over and over that this is
[35:00] written to the church those that are in
[35:03] Christ Jesus all right and trying to
[35:07] tell us how to become into the stature
[35:12] of a perfect man the growth development
[35:17] of Christianity and we'll read in a
[35:20] minute where the Prophet said everything
[35:22] that we have is based up on faith in God
[35:29] all right now what he said everybody
[35:33] here in the building wants to know how
[35:35] to become closer to God he said I guess
[35:39] brother and sister kids about the oldest
[35:41] the tourism and he said everybody said
[35:44] you asked and say their desire in their
[35:46] heart is to be closer to God now if
[35:51] that's not within your heart you need to
[35:53] get a new birth well I'm satisfied where
[35:57] I'm at well that's all right that's
[36:00] between you and God too
[36:01] so you go ahead all right but we're all
[36:04] trying to find out how to come to a
[36:08] place to be AB Wehling place for God to
[36:12] live in
[36:15] right you remember all of those out of
[36:17] the Statue a perfect man and knowing
[36:21] that we must come to that position if
[36:27] we're gonna get out of here if there's
[36:29] going to be a rapture of change things
[36:32] it's not just something that well town's
[36:35] gonna run out no the Bible says there's
[36:42] a time to all things it doesn't say
[36:44] there's a time for all time it says
[36:46] there's a time to all things so then
[36:50] there's got to be a place of position
[36:52] some were that somebody's going to reach
[36:55] the place all right
[36:59] but if it's not talked to the people how
[37:01] can they attain unto go to this serious
[37:08] then put them out for each statue of
[37:10] perfect man that's the question I asked
[37:11] I said now how do I get these how do I
[37:16] get these virtues because if they're
[37:20] necessary then we must have some way
[37:24] well I that's what this prophets message
[37:27] come to bring to do two things restore
[37:32] the faith of the fathers right and then
[37:36] bring the thunders which the revelation
[37:37] containing the seventh seal and it'll be
[37:39] them divinely revealed truths that
[37:41] literally turn us back that's 327 church
[37:44] age we'll read it when you get home but
[37:49] first is to return the faith of the
[37:50] fathers the revelation the faith to the
[37:55] position that the disciples were thrown
[37:58] around instead statue of a perfect man
[38:00] he said those disciples had these
[38:04] virtues uh-huh he said a little bit now
[38:11] before we lose all of it same message he
[38:13] said they didn't have the headstone he
[38:16] said cause the headstone hadn't come yet
[38:20] we said to add these virtues all right
[38:24] he said I come to build individuals
[38:28] into these virtues so the message of the
[38:32] hour is to bring you an eye to the
[38:36] stature of a perfect man where the
[38:38] disciples were that was called the faith
[38:41] of the father's see the faith of the
[38:47] father's is just not to get a new birth
[38:49] that's where you start from
[38:52] but you must grow in grace and knowledge
[38:57] right see until it comes to that
[39:01] he said well brother the way you talk
[39:05] about it that it don't look like it's
[39:07] gonna be a lot of us brother around him
[39:14] you want him he said I doubt it doesnäôt
[39:18] of this generation you want him you want
[39:20] a quote with the Prophet yeah but
[39:25] there's millions following this message
[39:27] today amen he wouldn't be Christian eyes
[39:31] nobody but he said it's a small farm
[39:35] flock right he said what about one out
[39:40] of a state well that puts you to safety
[39:49] what about all the types in the shadows
[39:52] of Enoch one representing the rapture he
[40:09] said well yes you scare me well in order
[40:11] scare us because that's what we'll get
[40:13] back to it on blasphemous names that
[40:16] sister said the way you taught it
[40:18] brother Branham read it blasphemous
[40:20] names over and over
[40:21] cuz we're gonna get back into that said
[40:24] the way that you taught it said there's
[40:28] any way for any of us to have this she
[40:35] was concerned whether she had the
[40:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost or not well
[40:38] yet you just base it upon well I believe
[40:41] the message
[40:43] well she was sitting like they're
[40:44] listening to the messenger she said but
[40:49] the way you're teaching it said it
[40:51] sounds like we don't know see we we want
[41:02] to be come to the dwelling place of
[41:04] Almighty God and to do that would
[41:08] require the new birth to start and the
[41:15] virtues of Almighty God and we won't get
[41:19] to it tonight because we're going to go
[41:20] into it another way but see faith is not
[41:24] a virtue faith is a birth faith is a
[41:31] birth and don't say add two five don't
[41:35] say add faith Peter don't say add faith
[41:42] he said that virtue to your faith faith
[41:46] is a birth virtue is an impartation of
[41:53] the life of God to come into us because
[41:55] of the development of Christianity when
[42:02] I tell you what it is that's what gets
[42:04] me this enriched me to all smithereens
[42:08] as everybody thinks that brother Dale is
[42:10] so deep they can't understand you know
[42:15] what start talking about the new birth
[42:17] and bringing it right down to talking
[42:20] about were you and I were and how God
[42:23] began to deal with us and we could
[42:26] accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and
[42:29] yet you think that's deep
[42:31] how much more simpler can it be gotten
[42:37] you explain what you see everybody I
[42:41] know you just too deep we can't
[42:42] understand no you don't want to
[42:44] understand you won't listen and do like
[42:48] that lady and say Lord do I have the new
[42:53] birth
[42:56] how many of you have searched your soul
[42:59] since we've been preaching about the new
[43:01] birth and thinking about well I wonder
[43:04] whether I have the new birth or not no
[43:12] no go cuz no brother Dale I could never
[43:15] say that in the house a new birth
[43:16] I know I got the new borough how do you
[43:20] know see then we put it on well I
[43:27] believe the message I'll remind you that
[43:32] the shop owner must have been pretty
[43:33] good believers because I stayed with it
[43:35] for three and a half years and they
[43:38] still didn't get it right until Holy
[43:39] Ghost can no that's that true but all
[43:45] right what you see how do we become the
[43:49] dwelling place of Almighty God is
[43:52] because this body physically speaking
[43:56] this body is a body that mankind lives
[44:01] in brother branham's was talking about
[44:03] it or something
[44:04] wait I guess what was about that all
[44:07] this just holds together you know you
[44:11] got flesh and things around and it just
[44:13] keeps that all that stuff in fact and we
[44:17] keep trying to increase it making a
[44:19] bigger place you know all right let's
[44:23] see this body is just a flesh to house
[44:27] what's within us but now physically
[44:32] speaking that will cover it
[44:34] we see then we talk about a house being
[44:36] a tabernacle a building a church or etc
[44:40] or a temple
[44:40] you know and that's well and good but
[44:44] what is the house of God it's the new
[44:50] birth in your soul that is the house of
[44:55] God
[44:57] right you get it that is the house of
[45:01] God is that new birth and that new birth
[45:04] has to have physical things together
[45:08] around to hold it all together until we
[45:11] finish alright and see then we come into
[45:15] that body of Christ by the new birth
[45:21] being born again by the incorruptible
[45:23] Word of God bringing us to that new
[45:27] birth to become a partaker of his divine
[45:30] nature alright we'll get back to this
[45:35] and in a little while but that one the
[45:37] one in order strike you real good
[45:38] where I give it to you the other day on
[45:40] the position of a believer in Christ but
[45:42] a run said after coming into the body we
[45:45] become protected let's get let's start
[45:47] with that where we at
[45:48] I told them we didn't know where we'd
[45:49] start where we're gonna end let's see
[45:52] okay that'll be number eight brothers so
[45:56] if you want bring it up while he's
[45:59] getting there he said what is the
[46:00] tabernacle of God a body God
[46:03] tabernacling in a body all right he said
[46:07] he changes our nature by sending upon us
[46:10] this is from the statue of a perfect man
[46:12] sitting upon us the Holy Spirit then we
[46:15] become into the divine nature of God
[46:18] then we've become a dwelling place for
[46:21] God Jesus said at that day you'll know
[46:23] that I'm and the father father and me
[46:25] and I on you you'll know then because
[46:27] you become the dwelling place now look
[46:29] where he takes you this is 1955 this is
[46:34] 62 statue of perfect man look how far
[46:36] back of what he was talking about on the
[46:38] position of a believers that's all in
[46:40] the adoption the believers the position
[46:43] I would invite you to listen to those
[46:45] tapes and things or read on the adoption
[46:47] because we will eventually be into it
[46:50] look at that bruise wounded torn open up
[46:54] his side with a Roman spear in order
[46:56] that by the Holy Spirit we could be
[46:57] baptized into his body
[46:59] protectors of his divine nature you get
[47:02] it then you become a partaker after
[47:05] coming into his body a partaker of his
[47:09] divine nature Christ nature in you if
[47:12] you be a protector in Christ and you
[47:14] become a new creature old things passed
[47:16] away and all things have become new
[47:21] divine nature you get the new birth that
[47:26] gives you baby nature of God which is
[47:29] the divine nature of Almighty God to
[47:32] come and live in your soul by the new
[47:34] birth but then I after becoming into the
[47:36] body you become partakers of His divine
[47:41] nature see a growth development a growth
[47:46] development into Christ - were look what
[47:51] he goes on on this one this is all for
[47:54] the the position of them believer roll
[47:55] that back that let's see if we got it no
[48:00] bring that back down or up every which
[48:02] way y'all go okay
[48:04] then you become four take her now listen
[48:08] you become a partaker after coming into
[48:11] his body and particular of his divine
[48:12] nature Christ nature in you how can you
[48:15] cheat still live backslide process must
[48:18] have a price time somebody else tell it
[48:21] I can't everything else with a divine
[48:23] nature of Christ in you how can you do
[48:25] those things with the divine nature of
[48:28] Christ in you it's impossible let that
[48:30] soak just a few minutes kotas right if
[48:32] you be a partaker in Christ then you
[48:34] become a new creature old things has
[48:37] passed away the watch all of our
[48:41] warnings warring excuse me a-- and
[48:44] fussing and stewing and arguing and
[48:48] temper and all of these things pass away
[48:52] did you see it those are the things that
[48:57] god's trying to get us to get rid of he
[49:04] says on the message of the stature of a
[49:06] perfect man paragraph eighty one faith
[49:09] holds the key that unlocks Christ to the
[49:11] people unlocks it reveals it so today
[49:15] we're going to try to take that same key
[49:18] to unlock the way to become a virtuous
[49:21] Christian in the stature of God that and
[49:25] be a living tabernacle for the Living
[49:28] God to dwell in what about
[49:35] he's going to open ok what's it going to
[49:39] turn out to be he goes on over to
[49:44] paragraph 82 I don't think this one's up
[49:50] for them I think it paragraphing 93 and
[49:55] look you say I'm supposed to have virtue
[49:58] it's on a virtue that's what he's saying
[50:03] right here I'm supposed to live
[50:05] gardening this so I'll just have it well
[50:12] brother I've got a that's where we're
[50:14] gonna get to it in a minute
[50:15] Rodale I'll try to live a good Christian
[50:19] live well amen that's good what's the
[50:23] new birth ought to be the other son why
[50:28] you're only trying to place feathers
[50:31] though they're in your reach you can't
[50:35] put the feathers in the wrong bird now
[50:41] you know what he's talking about black
[50:42] birds and the things right now let's
[50:44] just read awhile
[50:45] come on let's pick this up we'll get on
[50:47] go to number 11 statue a perfect man
[50:49] paragraph 94 well that's the way it is
[50:51] trying to manufacture Christianity you
[50:54] can't do it
[50:55] see that's the way it is trying to
[50:58] manufacture Christianity you can't do it
[51:01] all right first thing you got to do is
[51:07] to be born again you got to be changed
[51:10] we're where we need to be on paragraph
[51:12] 94 do it just go ahead and bring it on
[51:17] up to 94 because that's all right well
[51:19] that's the way it is trying to
[51:20] manufacture Christianity you can't do it
[51:23] first thing you got to do is to be born
[51:25] again you got to be changed and when
[51:28] you're changed you become a new creation
[51:29] now you're getting right now now you
[51:32] don't have to worry about the feathers
[51:35] now you know what he's talking about
[51:36] cutting it short what is it he said you
[51:39] can people claim to how this portion of
[51:41] these virtues are not even being born
[51:42] again and he said they do people you met
[51:46] people that are actually
[51:47] people in live good lives etc he said
[51:50] but that's like a black bird you know
[51:52] trying to put peacock feathers in and
[51:54] all kind of changing the birds it won't
[51:56] work you got to be born again alright
[52:00] now look you don't have to worry about
[52:02] the feathers if you get born again right
[52:08] it'll take care of itself when you're
[52:11] born again but you got to be changed you
[52:14] got to change his nature and the rest of
[52:16] him will take care of itself
[52:18] notice you must be born again that is
[52:20] change there's got to be a change but he
[52:24] isn't a Christian until he's born again
[52:26] you're supposed to have read all of
[52:27] these so listen to what he's saying
[52:34] go ahead 90 100 and 101 okay they can't
[52:40] understand it until that man is born
[52:42] again then when he's born again then
[52:46] he's in line of fellowship because he's
[52:48] a new creation that old suspicious
[52:50] doubting character he was is dead now
[52:54] he's a new creation so you see he don't
[52:56] have to add anything to his now because
[52:59] it automatically be added all right now
[53:05] are you following me
[53:06] the first thing to do in the in the
[53:09] statue of a perfect man is to be born
[53:11] again and we'll read it in a minute
[53:12] which is faith how faith and be born
[53:16] again all right then you don't have to
[53:19] worry about it all you got to do it eat
[53:22] look at the 50 years that we've had to
[53:26] study this message why should there be
[53:28] any problem why should they be thousands
[53:34] of different ways of everybody pulling
[53:36] apart in the message they've got one
[53:40] message in fifty years to study it
[53:50] to see if they'd I don't like somebody
[53:52] to stay and say come show me where I've
[53:54] been off fifty years and fathered all
[53:57] these garbage can doctors that you
[53:59] followed oh yeah we've had them here
[54:04] they jumped up and down on the floor and
[54:05] stomped her feet and said gal for this
[54:08] stuff trying to force us to believe this
[54:10] oh yeah we've been through a lot of it
[54:15] go no watch what he says because it'll
[54:19] automatically be added all you got to do
[54:22] is get born again now listen you said
[54:27] well all I gotta do is get born again
[54:28] and they're not everything no because
[54:31] when you get born again you're just in
[54:33] start we're gonna read in a minute
[54:34] that's when you start growing that's
[54:36] when that nature within you is pulling
[54:38] if that nature could be pulling me as a
[54:41] sinner to word it I would repent of the
[54:44] sins that I doing as a sinner and me
[54:49] still a sinner how much more would it be
[54:52] to realize the opening of the word and
[54:56] the studying of the word is to bring the
[54:58] nature of God into you and me and do
[55:04] away with our old nature our old being
[55:06] old parts that we still are comes listen
[55:09] when your first born again as a baby you
[55:13] want me to put it this way this is what
[55:15] I've always preached and always with you
[55:17] know that ever born-again believer new
[55:19] birth eternal life in so born-again
[55:22] believer you know what you start off as
[55:24] a baby now let's see if you agree with
[55:27] this one ever newborn baby is a legalist
[55:35] now you're gonna differ there so go
[55:38] ahead you're a legalist when you first
[55:43] start because you can't be nothing else
[55:49] yeah
[55:50] now you see one of them preachers all
[55:52] they can do stay on legalism that's
[55:57] there better that ain't mine but you
[56:00] know Alling preach on tired and read
[56:02] some clothes and it's nothing you know
[56:04] I'm a firm believer and every bit of it
[56:06] I don't believe you have to be beat to
[56:09] death I believe if you feed a baby
[56:13] it will grow but if you don't feed it
[56:17] right it ain't gonna grow right so is it
[56:22] with a Christian and I want now watch
[56:24] what he says you must be born again and
[56:26] when you're born again you can't be born
[56:29] again without having faith now what's
[56:32] this thing on the Statue of perfect man
[56:34] what does it start with it says add to
[56:36] your faith they don't say add faith now
[56:42] faith is the new birth all right what's
[56:46] he saying you can't be born again
[56:47] without having faith that's right so you
[56:49] see on my chart here I got the very
[56:51] foundation faith faith is the foundation
[56:54] of all of it far without faith it's
[56:57] impossible to please God he that cometh
[56:59] to God must believe that he is and a
[57:01] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[57:03] Him see he must be and when you're a
[57:06] skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic
[57:08] of the word being right you just might
[57:10] as well stay back until first you
[57:13] believe it what is sin unbelief so what
[57:20] are you stay back until you get that
[57:21] unbelief out there's only two elements
[57:24] that controls the human being that's
[57:26] either doubt or faith one of the other
[57:29] you possess the one that dominates your
[57:32] life just depends on how much faith you
[57:35] have how high you can rise but first
[57:39] it's got to be faith and let me stay on
[57:41] that foundation for a while now faith
[57:43] faith is what you must believe faith is
[57:46] what faith is the substance of things
[57:47] hoped for it's your if you already have
[57:52] it when you have faith because it's
[57:55] revealed in faith come on faith is the
[58:01] substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11
[58:03] well what kind of an evidence a holy
[58:05] evidence you might have hope just keep
[58:09] dodging to this and dodging to that but
[58:13] when you got faith you know it because
[58:15] it's the evidence
[58:17] that you've got it okay keep on going
[58:20] because we're just reading it I have a
[58:22] statue of a perfect man that should be
[58:24] what number eleven twelve okay this is
[58:29] just one after the other to read
[58:31] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient
[58:33] infinite that's God so when they make a
[58:36] phone call and say pray that contacts
[58:39] and your faith brings God it's the thing
[58:42] that brings a prayer and God together on
[58:44] the scene prayer faith changes from here
[58:47] to here it brings it together speak on
[58:50] the word and you say the word has
[58:52] everything is right all right
[58:53] faith does the rest of it faith does the
[58:57] rest
[58:57] so you just have faith for a foundation
[59:00] all Christianity oh you are all you'll
[59:05] ever be is the based upon faith in the
[59:09] word that's the reason I believe the
[59:11] word everything is based upon faith so
[59:16] that's why faith is your foundation for
[59:18] the Statue of a perfect man is the word
[59:21] faith because it's the substance of
[59:25] things hoped for the evidence of things
[59:28] not seen
[59:28] okay go ahead first you've got to be
[59:34] born again and when you're born again
[59:36] you have faith you believe the word
[59:38] until you're born again you'll argue
[59:40] against it it's if you're just
[59:44] religiously inclined he talks about it
[59:46] should do right would never be able to
[59:47] argue and all I care about and born
[59:49] again it produces faith all right then
[59:52] after you get faith this right here FAI
[59:55] teenage faith then you're just in
[59:57] position of growing and a lot of people
[1:00:04] go up to the altar and I listen and pray
[1:00:07] and say Lord forgive me and a great
[1:00:09] experience of sanctification come upon
[1:00:14] them and things then you have a great
[1:00:16] time you get up to the altar shouting
[1:00:19] you go back say bless God I got it
[1:00:22] no you just started to a place or you
[1:00:25] can grow remember how much we emphasize
[1:00:30] on
[1:00:30] vacation because that's the danger one
[1:00:32] because you think you're right because
[1:00:34] you get new desires you get new thoughts
[1:00:37] new ideas new things you go to church
[1:00:39] you read you the word you pray you do
[1:00:42] things he says you're not right yet you
[1:00:46] just laid the foundation now you're
[1:00:49] gonna build a house you pour the
[1:00:50] foundation say boy I got her you got the
[1:00:53] foundation to build your house on now
[1:00:56] you got to build a house now there's
[1:00:58] where the thing comes in this morning
[1:01:01] we're going to talk about now all right
[1:01:03] a house this foundation is for what is
[1:01:06] the foundation of Christianity faith in
[1:01:08] the Word of God that's your foundation
[1:01:11] then you begin to grow then you start
[1:01:13] you begin to add to this foundation you
[1:01:18] begin to add to your foundation now
[1:01:23] remember when we get started up the
[1:01:25] pyramid
[1:01:25] you're going to see the Holy Spirit
[1:01:27] seals in these things and that's where
[1:01:30] the trouble is out you say you got faith
[1:01:34] in virtue and you look on our silver
[1:01:36] brother Dale I got brotherly kindness
[1:01:38] you don't know how the brotherly
[1:01:40] kindness of Jesus Christ is right
[1:01:43] because you're gonna have to wait until
[1:01:45] each one seals in to get up to that you
[1:01:48] can't have brotherly kindness before you
[1:01:51] get all of these other things now that's
[1:01:54] your prophets words let's see you're not
[1:01:58] gonna listen to that go read the book
[1:02:02] I've asked you to read the book huh what
[1:02:06] is the foundation of they'll try to know
[1:02:10] okay you're going to build a house now
[1:02:14] there's where the time these things come
[1:02:15] in to found out what is the foundation
[1:02:17] of Christian faith in the Word of God
[1:02:19] that's your foundation then you begin to
[1:02:20] grow then you start you begin to add to
[1:02:22] this foundation okay quit a little bit
[1:02:29] one third fall and we jump over to three
[1:02:33] 3:09 after you come after you doesn't
[1:02:36] come from here to here to here to here
[1:02:39] to here to here now now you're coming
[1:02:41] into the full stature now a son of God
[1:02:44] but you've got to have this plus all
[1:02:47] this and you can't even start until you
[1:02:52] get this and that that a sensible
[1:02:56] statement you've got to have this and
[1:02:59] then all that and you can't even start
[1:03:01] you said well brother Dale I just jump I
[1:03:05] just wait on y'all I just jump up here
[1:03:07] brother kindness no you got to have this
[1:03:10] and then this seals in and this seals in
[1:03:14] and this seals in and this seals in that
[1:03:16] sealed in and brother Brown comes up to
[1:03:18] God on this and he said look you come
[1:03:20] all this way and look what God required
[1:03:25] he gets up to godliness and the statue
[1:03:27] of perfect man he said you come all this
[1:03:29] way they ain't got to hold a ghost yet
[1:03:35] you see there's a lot in this message
[1:03:38] that needs to be understood after you
[1:03:44] done come through here here here you're
[1:03:45] coming into the full stature now of a
[1:03:47] son of God but you got how this plus all
[1:03:51] this and you can't even start until you
[1:03:53] get this and remember the black bird
[1:03:55] with peacock feathers don't forget him
[1:03:57] don't try to add it to your actually
[1:04:01] born again I don't care how much you say
[1:04:05] you got knowledge it's not head
[1:04:07] knowledge it's holy ghost knowledge well
[1:04:12] I got brother in the kindness brother
[1:04:13] Dale if you don't have faith virtue
[1:04:16] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:04:17] your brotherly kindness is not correct
[1:04:22] well why can't I have that because God
[1:04:25] said you can't the Prophet said you
[1:04:27] can't do this do you get this okay don't
[1:04:33] try to add it to your actually born
[1:04:35] again cuz it won't work you can't make
[1:04:38] it work it comes to this or this here
[1:04:40] it'll crumble somewhere so you try to
[1:04:45] say I've got brotherly kindness and you
[1:04:49] ain't even got virtue or knowledge it'll
[1:04:52] crumble
[1:04:53] why because it's not sealed in
[1:04:56] all these things have got to be
[1:04:58] vulcanized sealed in and you seal them
[1:05:00] in one at the time you don't seal
[1:05:02] something way up to top and then wait
[1:05:05] and see if something down to bottom and
[1:05:06] seal some you know you gotta have faith
[1:05:08] for the warning and experience to seal
[1:05:10] you in the body of Christ then virtue
[1:05:12] has to seal you in to Christ before you
[1:05:18] can talk about Holy Ghost knowledge I
[1:05:22] wish I could ride back through the
[1:05:24] mountains that I rode years ago that was
[1:05:27] going over to brother Ben Howard's and
[1:05:30] the Lord began to deal with me about
[1:05:32] faith virtue and all these tempers and I
[1:05:34] could see how each one was a further
[1:05:36] development of the ones before you see
[1:05:42] you got faith in virtue that's the only
[1:05:44] way you'll ever come to Holy Ghost
[1:05:46] knowledge is to have faith in virtually
[1:05:49] as Holy Ghost faith and virtue you never
[1:05:53] come to brotherly kindness until you
[1:05:55] come up the statue of a perfect man
[1:05:57] there's where it's been so much talk and
[1:06:00] people don't listen they don't listen to
[1:06:03] the profit you get downs you know
[1:06:05] genuine born-again dove then you don't
[1:06:08] add nothing it adds to you comes on up
[1:06:15] all right coming into perfection man all
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:18] what about it coming on into perfection
[1:06:23] what about it Church do we have the new
[1:06:31] birth
[1:06:36] do we have the new birth
[1:06:45] let's go to 132 come back to that one
[1:06:49] number thirteen would be 132 paragraph
[1:06:53] 132 they come back to number 13 now a
[1:06:58] lot of people go up to the altar and
[1:06:59] pray and that's where he says you know
[1:07:00] they come out shout and he go back see
[1:07:02] bless God I got it no you started to a
[1:07:04] place to where you can grow you ain't
[1:07:06] done nothing yet see the only thing you
[1:07:09] doing is just laid the foundation now
[1:07:11] you're gonna build a house you pour the
[1:07:13] foundation you got to build it they're
[1:07:15] older don't know you talk about it now
[1:07:17] all right watch what he say it a house
[1:07:20] this foundation is first what is the
[1:07:23] foundation of Christianity faith in the
[1:07:26] Word of God what does it come out to add
[1:07:31] faith to your virtue listen to this one
[1:07:34] go ahead we'll get number fourteen then
[1:07:36] we're gonna pick up real quick
[1:07:37] fourteen I think we've done been through
[1:07:39] it but after you come from here to here
[1:07:41] to here to here here you're coming into
[1:07:43] full stature son of God but you gotta
[1:07:45] have this plus all this and you can't
[1:07:48] even start until you get this why
[1:07:50] because what are you doing you're like a
[1:07:53] bird a black bird with a peacock feather
[1:07:54] calling and saying I got it there's no
[1:08:00] need of trying to say what you got the
[1:08:02] best thing to do is try to get it and
[1:08:05] find out how to get it and then go that
[1:08:08] way right know whether who was it was it
[1:08:14] brother would be used to make that
[1:08:16] statement he said you've got to go where
[1:08:18] the fellows got to stuff you know if you
[1:08:23] want dope you got to go to where the
[1:08:26] fellows got to stuff right
[1:08:30] that truth if you want Christianity you
[1:08:34] got to go to the fellows got the word
[1:08:37] well brother Dale do you think you're
[1:08:39] the only one ain't never said that
[1:08:42] never will say that why would you say it
[1:08:47] because I spent my life I have given
[1:08:52] over fifty years of my life to studying
[1:08:57] the Word of God
[1:08:59] and all people can get out of it is
[1:09:02] you're thinking you're some intellectual
[1:09:03] something I can't help it
[1:09:07] if God has given me what he'd give me
[1:09:09] but neither will I deny what he's giving
[1:09:12] me either
[1:09:13] I'll stand on it until we pass away this
[1:09:18] message is right it don't need nobody to
[1:09:22] interpret it
[1:09:23] it needs somebody to believe it and
[1:09:29] accept it and move on all right you come
[1:09:33] to a dwelling place that's why you find
[1:09:36] scrap seats of ministers of Christians
[1:09:41] piled along the way now that's what he's
[1:09:44] done we find the scrap heaps piled along
[1:09:48] the way is because they didn't go into
[1:09:52] it right that's paragraph 139 statue of
[1:09:58] perfect man that's why I'm here this
[1:10:00] morning paragraph 140 is to try to teach
[1:10:05] this little church and myself how that
[1:10:10] we can become the dwelling place of the
[1:10:12] Living God and they would like to be
[1:10:16] that the dwelling place and here is what
[1:10:20] we do you got it up and here is what we
[1:10:25] do what's the first thing we have faith
[1:10:28] and be born again let's lay in the
[1:10:31] foundation then after you lay it lay the
[1:10:33] foundation secondly add to your
[1:10:35] foundation add to your faith Peter said

[1:10:53] added so get to start with a with a
[1:10:56] faith all right now right here we're
[1:10:58] knocks a lot of us down yes sir add
[1:11:03] virtue to your faith that doesn't mean
[1:11:07] living a virgin life
[1:11:13] the adverts are doesn't mean to live a
[1:11:17] virgin life you know like the manner of
[1:11:23] the woman and so forth that doesn't have
[1:11:24] nothing to do with that virgin life do
[1:11:34] you know what the definition for the
[1:11:35] word the definition in a statue of a
[1:11:42] perfect man for the word faith there's
[1:11:48] two times listed our faith our virtue
[1:11:51] excuse me
[1:11:51] it means of virtuous now listen to the
[1:11:54] difference listen to what the man is
[1:11:56] saying the world thinks virtue means a
[1:12:01] virgin life it ain't got a thing to do
[1:12:04] with a virgin life virgin life don't
[1:12:11] mean you're a Christian right to be a
[1:12:17] virgin doesn't mean you're a Christian
[1:12:19] why would your prophet say that because
[1:12:27] he knew what that other definition
[1:12:29] listen to the definition of the word
[1:12:31] virtue it means a virtuous course of
[1:12:35] thought now listen we're going to give
[1:12:40] you this definition then brother Branham
[1:12:42] is going to give you his understanding
[1:12:45] because he pulls over the word virtue
[1:12:48] and takes it to Luke and talks about
[1:12:53] power
[1:12:56] there's brother Brandon believing a
[1:12:58] virtuous life but he knows a virgin it
[1:13:02] didn't make no difference I don't mean
[1:13:04] your Christian cause you a virgin
[1:13:08] right means you're a Christian whether
[1:13:11] you're born again or not so then what is
[1:13:16] the word virtue in the statute of
[1:13:18] perfect man are the Peter that we read a
[1:13:20] virtuous course of thought feeling and
[1:13:24] action means virtue means moral goodness
[1:13:30] any particular moral excellency as
[1:13:35] modesty and purity you say well that's
[1:13:38] that's not the Virgin that's not just
[1:13:40] being a virgin that's being a virtuous
[1:13:43] Christian come on you don't have to be a
[1:13:51] virgin to be a virtuous Christian no
[1:13:54] don't tie it all together the virtuous
[1:13:59] Christian is one who has what
[1:14:03] praiseworthy
[1:14:05] a virtuous course of thought the brother
[1:14:09] Branham says in a minute we're going to
[1:14:11] read it he said you've got to have
[1:14:13] virtue and a pice for it to go out now
[1:14:20] what is the Pais for it to go out the
[1:14:26] life you live before others is the Pais
[1:14:30] that lets virtue go out for others to
[1:14:33] see it right but a virgin a virtuous
[1:14:43] life a life lived in Christ is the
[1:14:51] greatest soul-winning thing that there
[1:14:54] is Oh we'll get into it in a minute
[1:14:57] where the Prophet says yeah I said
[1:14:58] that's the reason said they see you in
[1:15:00] church acting like a Christian oh you're
[1:15:03] a good Christian here
[1:15:04] you don't Dyer dress and act and talk
[1:15:08] and everything here like you do at home
[1:15:11] or out somewheres I haven't well you
[1:15:17] know the people out there is once
[1:15:18] looking at you that's why I love the
[1:15:23] Bible
[1:15:23] I remember this in the Baptist Church
[1:15:27] you know that to be a deacon we think
[1:15:33] he's supposed to have this this or this
[1:15:35] is it you know what the Bible says about
[1:15:36] a deacon sure all of those are right
[1:15:39] supposed to be the husband one wife he's
[1:15:40] poor bill but you know what it mainly
[1:15:41] said of a good report of them that are
[1:15:47] with out her to set up a deacon we're
[1:15:54] not supposed to go among the
[1:15:55] congregation and ask them what they
[1:15:57] think of him we're supposed to go to the
[1:15:58] neighbors around it and see it and where
[1:16:01] he works at and think a good report of
[1:16:05] them that are without the Bible say okay
[1:16:08] virtue the Prophet said it's not just
[1:16:12] being a virgin
[1:16:14] but he knew it was to be a virtuous life
[1:16:18] because all Christianity's be based upon
[1:16:21] a virtuous life not a virgin life a
[1:16:24] virtuous life a life that Christ is
[1:16:28] within you living back out that others
[1:16:31] can say and want to act like you I told
[1:16:39] you I worked with these two women in a
[1:16:41] job that I had it we work side by side
[1:16:43] 24 hours a day I mean eight-hour today
[1:16:45] and one day his sister our lady she got
[1:16:49] a little upset and begin to say
[1:16:50] something I said you want gonna be
[1:16:53] talking like that that's what I
[1:16:56] understand I said I have my problems too
[1:16:58] she said Sam I worked with you you're in
[1:17:00] you're out said I've never seen you with
[1:17:04] a down expression
[1:17:13] maybe she didn't live close enough to me
[1:17:15] but that's alright but listen
[1:17:19] okay now we're going to go ahead because
[1:17:24] I got this I want to keep this right
[1:17:27] here to where we get to it but the words
[1:17:31] word virtue in Peter comes to the basis
[1:17:36] of a virtuous life in other words a life
[1:17:42] lived in Christ with moral goodness
[1:17:45] goodness and thing and a procurer moral
[1:17:48] in excellency as modesty and purity but
[1:17:55] a random rule were going to read it in a
[1:17:57] minute where he says strength is what
[1:18:00] it's talking about as a virtue there and
[1:18:02] he said strength is like in Luke you
[1:18:07] remember in Luke where it said virtue
[1:18:08] went out mark and Luke both talked of
[1:18:14] the virtue that went out we think it and
[1:18:22] it was now listen it was that he got
[1:18:25] weak but that wasn't it was what caused
[1:18:28] him to get weak don't go with just being
[1:18:31] weak because you can run a five-mile
[1:18:35] footrace and you're gonna be weak that
[1:18:37] ain't got nothing to do with what he's
[1:18:40] talking about but look that one that's
[1:18:45] used in this in the statute of a perfect
[1:18:47] manner in Peter is using that then in
[1:18:50] Luke it's using doing the must this
[1:18:55] means power like dynamite basically
[1:18:59] power mighty work strength miracle my
[1:19:02] virtue my strength power ability in hurt
[1:19:06] power power residing in a thing by
[1:19:10] virtue of its nature or which is a
[1:19:12] person or thing exerts and put forth
[1:19:15] power for performing miracles moral
[1:19:19] power and excellency of so the power and
[1:19:22] influence which belong to riches and
[1:19:24] wealth don't get tetanus on
[1:19:26] it belongs with power and resources
[1:19:29] arising from numbers power consisting in
[1:19:34] our resting upon like armies or it
[1:19:37] forces our host something to back it up
[1:19:39] so now listen I want to get this one and
[1:19:43] then we're gonna do about two and
[1:19:45] they'll quit do we say the Bible say it
[1:19:48] or he's just that it doesn't just mean
[1:19:51] living a virgin life you know I look
[1:19:54] like a woman or a man it doesn't just
[1:19:56] mean that it means the living a virtuous
[1:19:58] life a life in Christ right nothing to
[1:20:04] do with that part nothing to do with it
[1:20:06] the Bible said we read over here in the
[1:20:08] Book of Luke where it said virtue went
[1:20:10] out of him that right congregation says
[1:20:13] amen if we're going to be like him we
[1:20:17] must have virtue then we must have it to
[1:20:20] be like him is the first song that I
[1:20:26] ever loved in the hems one of the
[1:20:28] greatest words to be like Jesus well if
[1:20:30] I'm going to be like Jesus I got to have
[1:20:32] virtue and a pice that it can Pais
[1:20:36] forward from me to the people what did
[1:20:41] they see in Jesus oh they didn't agree
[1:20:46] with him about the first season as ever
[1:20:47] but what did they see a man going about
[1:20:50] raising the dead healing the sick
[1:20:52] casting out Devils feeding the people
[1:20:55] had a good virtuous life didn't it that
[1:21:00] drawed power or strength to them that
[1:21:04] needed it now listen because virtue went
[1:21:07] out of him to the people virtue and
[1:21:09] before you can let it out you've got to
[1:21:11] have it first you haven't got it it
[1:21:13] won't come out there's nothing for it to
[1:21:15] come out of what if somebody tried to
[1:21:18] draw virtue out of us and the check
[1:21:20] would return insufficient funds see no
[1:21:23] no none the arts are draw from check
[1:21:26] balance
[1:21:27] somebody looking at you as a Christian
[1:21:30] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[1:21:33] on like a sinner are you listening
[1:21:39] not much virtue can be drawn from that
[1:21:42] remember you got out of the virtue but a
[1:21:44] pice come on virtue must be in us until
[1:21:48] we get virtue then when we get true
[1:21:51] virtue we can add it to our faith true
[1:21:55] virtue you understand it that's the next
[1:21:59] foundation wall first you must have
[1:22:02] faith faith alone won't do it
[1:22:04] you got Peter said then add virtue to
[1:22:07] your faith you must have virtue in order
[1:22:10] to add it to your faith come on then it
[1:22:14] might be the reason you don't have it
[1:22:16] because many churches of today teach you
[1:22:18] don't have to have it are the days of it
[1:22:21] is past you don't have to have it only
[1:22:24] thing you have to do is just join church
[1:22:26] your days of spice now how many sermons
[1:22:29] that are preached then it's not this you
[1:22:32] come to church the new birth is not you
[1:22:35] come to church you come to the altar you
[1:22:37] cry and you pray and you say you're
[1:22:40] saved
[1:22:40] how many sermons did a preach on that
[1:22:43] how many hours have we spent into what
[1:22:46] he's saying about it many churches of
[1:22:49] today teach you don't have to have it
[1:22:50] are the days of it is past you don't
[1:22:54] have to have it only thing you have to
[1:22:55] do is just join church it days is past
[1:23:00] virtue anyone knows what the word virtue
[1:23:03] means seeing we must have it if virtue
[1:23:06] went out from him to heal the woman that
[1:23:09] was sick he's expecting the same virtue
[1:23:12] in his church because he was our example
[1:23:15] and if he had virtue to give to the
[1:23:17] people he expects us to have virtually
[1:23:19] to give to the people and what is virtue
[1:23:21] virtue is strength or power then
[1:23:27] watching because he's going back to Luke
[1:23:28] with it right some of them don't even
[1:23:30] believe in the power of God they say
[1:23:32] that's pious only thing you got to do is
[1:23:34] just put your name on the book and be
[1:23:36] sprinkled report or baptize or whatever
[1:23:38] more and that's all you have to do how
[1:23:40] many sermons did I preach what you
[1:23:42] needed to do as a Christian how you
[1:23:44] needed to get born again that's because
[1:23:47] of that statement look Peter says here
[1:23:50] add virtue and Peter's talking about
[1:23:52] building the house of
[1:23:53] see the temple of God fixing it to a
[1:23:55] place and after you have virtue
[1:23:56] you must have after you have faith you
[1:24:00] must have virtue with it that's right
[1:24:01] how virtue for the whole world what does
[1:24:06] it mean to do with this virtue that it
[1:24:11] drugs it gives it how you remember the
[1:24:15] lily it makes a beautiful shot for that
[1:24:18] admirer it opens up itself for honey and
[1:24:21] the beaze coming to see it you remember
[1:24:26] what we read up there a moment ago
[1:24:28] the run says you've got to have virtue
[1:24:32] and a pice for it to come out what is
[1:24:37] the pious it's your life living before
[1:24:41] others what about it
[1:24:48] your life living before others they can
[1:24:53] see that and they can draw virtue have
[1:24:57] you ever witnessed the Prophet in what
[1:25:04] he said did he get weak have you ever
[1:25:08] witnessed that have you ever witnessed
[1:25:12] the Lord Jesus getting weak have you
[1:25:17] ever witnessed that have you ever had it
[1:25:20] to happen to you that because of
[1:25:24] something and all you get weak
[1:25:34] I'm on you ever had it
[1:25:42] better brother McGarity come up here to
[1:25:44] be prayed for one time and he asked me
[1:25:49] to pray for him about something that was
[1:25:51] bothering him I prayed for him and I
[1:25:57] held his hands and prayed for him and I
[1:26:02] knew he didn't get it so what did I do
[1:26:12] the Bible says remember that the man
[1:26:18] they prayed for you know that they took
[1:26:21] him and held him until strength came in
[1:26:24] his body
[1:26:25] brother McGarity began to just fall away
[1:26:29] I got a decent amount of strength he was
[1:26:33] a little bit of guy which I was proud of
[1:26:35] at that time
[1:26:36] but as he began to just fall away I just
[1:26:39] took his hands and I just lifted him up
[1:26:43] and I held him and we kept praying after
[1:26:54] a while he was standing on his own two
[1:26:56] feet and I turned him loose because I
[1:27:02] had literally picked him up virtually
[1:27:05] almost in midair to hold him because I
[1:27:08] knew he didn't get it and he needed
[1:27:10] something but when I felt that from him
[1:27:13] pulling to me then I knew there was a
[1:27:16] saddle product I don't tell that for
[1:27:21] nothing but the honor and glory of God
[1:27:22] your you ought to be able to tell in
[1:27:24] your Christian experience something in
[1:27:26] your life where you've had things like
[1:27:28] that have you ever had something to just
[1:27:30] come to you you knew that was it that
[1:27:32] was settled it's finished
[1:27:33] there's no matter what anybody else said
[1:27:35] it was finished you ever been that way
[1:27:38] have you ever prayed until you got weak
[1:27:40] and praying you know I mean you just
[1:27:44] literally got weak that was what
[1:27:49] happened to the Lord Jesus when strength
[1:27:51] went out of him
[1:27:53] all right he got weak strength went out
[1:27:58] of it but was it all together strength
[1:28:02] of her might or was it God pulling upon
[1:28:11] his gift was God and brother branham
[1:28:16] when he said he'd pray until he could
[1:28:17] just these have set him down virtue went
[1:28:25] out of it but you know what while that
[1:28:29] virtue went out of caused the people
[1:28:31] that come to that meeting come expecting
[1:28:36] right they knew he had virtue and a pice
[1:28:43] what was brother Branham his pice the
[1:28:47] life he lived for a profit to make this
[1:28:54] statement was outstanding to me he says
[1:28:57] I have lived so close to God until it
[1:29:02] forced the gift to operate you hear that
[1:29:06] he said I live so close to God it forced
[1:29:09] a gift to work that man had a lot of
[1:29:16] Indian life he had the statue of a
[1:29:18] perfect man he had the virtues and he
[1:29:21] knew what they were he said I'm trying
[1:29:24] to tell you what they are and not only
[1:29:27] that would tell you how to get them like
[1:29:31] I said and I've said it many times
[1:29:35] 3:27 church age book tells you how to
[1:29:38] get the faith of the father 327 church
[1:29:42] age book tells you how to get the
[1:29:45] virtues and what did he say this
[1:29:53] messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will
[1:29:57] do two things 1 turn the hearts of the
[1:30:01] children back to the faith of the father
[1:30:03] that's what he came for to bring that
[1:30:06] part right
[1:30:07] but then he come to bring his messages
[1:30:10] because the faith of the fathers was not
[1:30:12] brother branham's message no more than
[1:30:15] it was his message to try to tell us how
[1:30:17] we need to live right that was the
[1:30:20] Christian experience from the Bible the
[1:30:22] disciples had these virtues and they had
[1:30:25] the staff they had the point to wear
[1:30:28] that the faith of the fathers dwelt
[1:30:29] within those apostles and they taught
[1:30:32] others how to come to the place they
[1:30:34] were that was in the word lorentz
[1:30:41] message he said didn't begin until the
[1:30:44] opening of the word of the seals he said
[1:30:46] not in the years of preparation and all
[1:30:49] he said but when he begins to silent
[1:30:53] that goes into the part to love what I
[1:30:58] said any he'll reveal those seven
[1:31:01] thunders which are the revelation
[1:31:03] contained in the seven seals
[1:31:05] it'll be these Ravalli reveal mystery
[1:31:08] truths that literally turn our hearts
[1:31:12] back but everybody's afraid to talk
[1:31:18] about thunder seals this that or the
[1:31:21] other they're scared I'll be scared when
[1:31:25] I'm saying what he said I might not be
[1:31:36] able to produce it but let me at least
[1:31:38] talk about it let me at least tell you
[1:31:43] I'll talk about it contain concern about
[1:31:45] arresting see it doesn't matter to me
[1:31:50] what happens in this individual but it
[1:31:53] means a lot to understand what will
[1:31:55] happen to you if I don't bring you the
[1:31:57] truth and I'll do anything I can to try
[1:32:02] to get you to see the word I've done it
[1:32:05] for 40 something years preached to you
[1:32:08] never backed off from anything and never
[1:32:11] allowed you to fall off into doctrines
[1:32:13] and ideas that some even would move a
[1:32:16] little bit and I'd say haha that's not
[1:32:17] right this is not right here
[1:32:21] that's that's not right
[1:32:25] become an enemy to a lot of people
[1:32:27] because that I would try to tell the
[1:32:29] church the truth not to get you to act
[1:32:33] like me but to get you to become a
[1:32:35] Christian read statue of a perfect man
[1:32:39] the Prophet said he came to teach us how
[1:32:42] to become into that stature of a perfect
[1:32:45] man well then why can't we believe
[1:32:47] that's what's supposed to be taking
[1:32:49] place it'll be these divinely revealed
[1:32:57] mystery twos that literally turn our
[1:32:59] hearts back why are we afraid of the
[1:33:05] Word of God I hope you follow me and
[1:33:11] understand what I'm talking about you
[1:33:14] can take words and twist everything into
[1:33:16] any direction you want to go when a
[1:33:21] prophet was like I said want to go he
[1:33:22] would say that he said virtue is not
[1:33:25] living a virgin life he wasn't against
[1:33:29] living a virgin life but he was against
[1:33:32] telling people that a virgin life was
[1:33:34] what was going to make you physical
[1:33:37] virgin life is wonderful honourable
[1:33:42] commendable praise God but it is not
[1:33:46] Christianity Christianity is the new
[1:33:49] birth the birth of the Word of God which
[1:33:54] would then make us sons and daughters of
[1:33:57] a living God in the virtuous Christian
[1:34:01] of a statue of a perfect man
[1:34:04] why are we still here because the people
[1:34:10] don't want to believe and put our whole
[1:34:13] being in to what the Prophet has to say
[1:34:19] then we have an excuse with well I don't
[1:34:22] really know you don't know you don't
[1:34:23] know what it is really day of God I
[1:34:25] don't know what it is he died and took
[1:34:26] it with him I ain't gonna argue with you
[1:34:32] about him dying taking it with
[1:34:35] I'm gonna argue with you at all
[1:34:39] but if he died and took you with him
[1:34:41] then evidently we don't need it so I
[1:34:45] ain't worried about it right what I'm
[1:34:50] concerned with is what we need the
[1:34:53] statue of a perfect man is what we need
[1:34:56] we need these virtues to be brought in
[1:34:59] to us by the opening of the word how
[1:35:03] else are they going to come in agent you
[1:35:09] say I need versus others have it that's
[1:35:13] a peacock and the Buzzard flirt feathers
[1:35:17] or something put into it but when we
[1:35:21] look straight at God's Word and take
[1:35:23] God's Word and believe what he says and
[1:35:27] he'll add what we have need of he'll add
