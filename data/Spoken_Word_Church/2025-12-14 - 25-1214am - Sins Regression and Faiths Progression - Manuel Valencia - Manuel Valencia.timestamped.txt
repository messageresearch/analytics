[0:00] We'll get ahead and do a word of prayer.
[0:02] Heavenly Father, we do submit to you.
[0:05] We're so grateful that we're here, that
[0:07] you brought us here, that you're giving
[0:09] us, Father, a a time to set aside this
[0:11] morning to start a brand new week. No
[0:13] doubt a busy week, this uh time of year.
[0:16] Um I pray that you will restore to us
[0:19] strength, vision, and give us, Father,
[0:22] what we have need this morning. and as a
[0:24] family, as individual that we come to
[0:25] hear your word. I pray that you will um
[0:28] give us supernatural food in due season
[0:30] here this morning. Uh prepare the minds
[0:32] and the hearts for service uh for later
[0:34] on for the sermon, Father, and for the
[0:35] worship service. As we pray, as we unite
[0:38] our faith, a lake of fires, Father, that
[0:39] we brought to have a good bonfire this
[0:41] morning, I pray. And I pray that you
[0:43] would uh quicken these words to us of
[0:45] eternal life in the name of the Lord and
[0:47] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the
[0:50] Lord.
[0:52] God bless you all saints. So today I'll
[0:55] be talking about um sin. We're going to
[0:57] be hitting it really hard today. So if
[0:59] you brought your uh mud boots on, put
[1:01] them on because we'll end in a good
[1:03] note. But you know uh lately I know
[1:05] noticed that there's been a lot of uh
[1:07] good encouraging word coming through and
[1:09] a lot of uh you know hopeful studies and
[1:12] and such. But we do know that sin is sin
[1:16] and and the word is the word and the
[1:18] word is and God is righteous. you know,
[1:19] he's a god of grace, but he's a god of
[1:21] uh correction and righteousness. So, I
[1:24] think this it's it's a very important
[1:25] thing that we uh really hone in and and
[1:28] really understand these these uh
[1:30] portions of scriptures. So, this is
[1:33] sin's regression. I was going to call it
[1:35] the sin progression meaning like how
[1:37] does sin progress because there's a
[1:38] scripture that tells you this that
[1:40] happens then this then this and it's
[1:41] actually four components that happen.
[1:44] But by that I mean the steps of it,
[1:46] right? But it's actually not a
[1:47] progression as we know. It is a
[1:49] regression. So with that, I would like
[1:50] to subtitle is faith progression.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Right? I think I do believe that God's
[1:55] word is is amen and amen and it is
[1:57] positive. Amen.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; So with that uh if you have James um we
[2:03] can go to um let me put this display
[2:05] setting in a different way here to pick
[2:08] a slideshow. There you go. So with this
[2:09] we have uh James 1 and this is going to
[2:12] be our anchor verse uh two verses a
[2:14] scripture 14 and then 15. It's
[2:16] noteworthy that you note it those that
[2:19] are following along. So
[2:22] look at the progression here. You know
[2:24] what ends up being a regression, right?
[2:25] It goes down not upwards. But every man
[2:28] is tempted. Before that it was talking
[2:31] about that God cannot be tempted, right?
[2:33] Of evil and he doesn't tempt himself
[2:36] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[2:41] and enticed.
[2:44] Then when lust hath conceived, look at
[2:48] the illustration there, conception in
[2:51] the womb, it bringeth forth sin,
[2:56] and sin when it is finished
[3:00] bringeth forth death.
[3:02] Amen. So I have it here with the the
[3:04] highlighted verses where it says, "But
[3:07] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[3:10] away." Okay. So there's a separation
[3:11] that happens of his own lust and
[3:14] enticed.
[3:16] Then when lust has conceived, it
[3:19] bringeth forth sin. And sin when it is
[3:22] finished bringeth forth death. So look
[3:26] at the progression here. We have a
[3:27] drawing away. A drawn away which usually
[3:29] means a stepping out. It usually means
[3:31] uh in order for you to sin, you had to
[3:33] actually come out of God's protection.
[3:36] You had to actually deny God's word to
[3:38] begin with. You have to start the first
[3:40] step and process of a disbelief
[3:44] of of a certain word, a precept
[3:47] um that has been set before us. And then
[3:51] picture this lust is is conceived.
[3:54] You're drawn away. Then lust. Then you
[3:57] have enticement which comes with the
[4:00] lure. It comes with the word enticement
[4:02] also means being uh captured. It also
[4:05] means that you are already hooked,
[4:08] right? So that's sins hook and it means
[4:10] that you're trapped really.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Then it says
[4:17] when lust is conceived, of course it's
[4:19] it's it's a conception now. So it's
[4:21] going to bring forth sin
[4:24] and then when sin sin is finished, when
[4:26] it has accomplished his work, it's going
[4:27] to bring forth death. So, you know, we
[4:30] are going to get a little bit on the on
[4:31] the sins progre regression there. And
[4:33] then uh just do note that we're going to
[4:36] get the head out of water out of this.
[4:37] So, because it is going to be uh you
[4:39] know, plenty of scriptures that that
[4:41] describe sin and really how horrible it
[4:43] is. You know, we know we got a message
[4:45] and we know that in our soul the the the
[4:47] born again child of God, bride of God um
[4:51] has been given a promise, right? That we
[4:53] didn't do it to begin with and that, you
[4:54] know, in our soul either sin or
[4:56] disbelief. But you know there's other
[4:58] aspects of us right there's people in
[4:59] different growth there is also uh you
[5:02] know you have your flesh you have your
[5:03] your spirit right the human spirit as
[5:05] well so picture it so it's lust enticed
[5:10] sin death
[5:13] that's James again so this is the cycle
[5:14] if you look at it it's you're drawn away
[5:18] then there is lust by his own lust not
[5:22] your neighbor's lust then you're enticed
[5:26] then there's sin and then there's death.
[5:29] And this is exactly all the scriptures,
[5:31] all the words that that James wrote
[5:35] about. This is how it it happens.
[5:39] And and to prove that in Romans 6:23, it
[5:42] says, "For the wages of sin is death,
[5:46] but the gift of God is eternal life
[5:48] through Jesus Christ our Lord." And here
[5:50] it's inevitable to to note that in order
[5:54] for you to have this eternal life and
[5:55] the gift and all that even to want a
[5:57] gift is you would have had to been a
[6:00] participant of wages right of sin and to
[6:04] actually be given that death as a wage
[6:07] of your sin. then you're a candidate
[6:11] to to hope for to want to aspire for
[6:16] something you can earn a gift of eternal
[6:19] life. So I had the same cycle here. I
[6:22] was like late last night trying to
[6:24] picture this so it could really uh sink
[6:26] in. It's the same cycle. Drawn away,
[6:30] lust, enticed,
[6:33] sin.
[6:35] But then
[6:37] it said at death after that, but
[6:39] somewhere between that or right after
[6:41] death, that's when you're in a position
[6:43] to to ask for forgiveness for the most
[6:46] part, right? For the for the ungenerate
[6:48] unregenerated person, for the for the
[6:51] person who's uh out away from the Lord.
[6:54] Of course, uh we'll bring a balance to
[6:56] this here as we go forth it. So, look at
[6:58] this. Proverbs 22:3. I I love this
[7:01] scripture, especially how it reads in
[7:02] Spanish. A prudent man foreseeth the
[7:04] evil. And this means the forewarn, the
[7:07] one that has been warned about
[7:08] something. Forese ahead of time. But
[7:12] when a prudent man sees evil from afar,
[7:15] it says he he does not pass by it. And
[7:17] here it says he hideth himself. But a
[7:20] simple one, a simple person pass on and
[7:24] are punished. So even when they see it
[7:26] afar, they actually do the opposite.
[7:29] They're drawn away
[7:32] then, you know, by his own lust.
[7:35] They're drawn away by his own I got to
[7:37] keep on the mic. They're drawn away on
[7:38] it by his own lust and then they are um
[7:41] they're uh enticed and then of course it
[7:45] sin is conceived and then it brings
[7:48] forth sin and then when sin is finished
[7:51] it produces death. Right? So
[7:56] the the scripture that is burning in my
[7:58] heart here's an illustration if anybody
[7:59] can guess what what this is going to be
[8:01] about is the simple one the the youth in
[8:05] Proverbs 7. So, and if you did single
[8:08] out your scriptures there, it's it's
[8:10] worth having it there because we're
[8:11] going to look at uh Proverbs 7, 6, and
[8:14] five. Those three relate to a same
[8:16] similar story. It's very near and dear
[8:19] to the heart because it I think it lays
[8:22] out the pro the progression again, the
[8:25] the steps that really, you know, result
[8:28] in in uh death. So, Proverbs 7 starting
[8:30] at verse 6,
[8:32] and I think we're going to go pretty
[8:33] close through the whole chapter. So for
[8:36] at the window of my house I looked
[8:38] through my casement
[8:41] and beheld among the simple ones
[8:46] I discerned.
[8:48] It's almost like could see it happening
[8:50] before it even happened
[8:52] among the youth a young man void of
[8:55] understanding
[8:57] passing through the streets near her
[8:59] corner
[9:01] and he went away. He went the way to her
[9:04] house that that was being drawn away in
[9:08] the twilight in the evening in the black
[9:12] and dark night.
[9:14] And behold, behold, there met him a
[9:17] woman with the attire of an harlot and
[9:20] subtle of heart. But have you heard that
[9:22] before? Right. Subtle. She's loud and
[9:25] stubborn. Her feet abide not in her
[9:28] house. Now is she without now in the
[9:31] streets and lith and wait at every
[9:34] corner. So she caught him that's
[9:37] enticement and kissed him and with an
[9:41] impotent face said unto him, I have
[9:44] peace offerings with me this day I have
[9:47] paid my vows. Therefore, come, excuse
[9:51] me, therefore came I forth to meet thee
[9:54] diligently to seek thy face, and I have
[9:57] found thee, and I have decked my bed
[10:00] with coverings of tapestry, with carved
[10:02] works, with fine linen of Egypt. I
[10:05] perfume my bed with myrr, alos, and
[10:07] cinnamon. Cinnamon. Come, let us take
[10:09] our field of love until the morning. Let
[10:11] us sol ourselves with love. For the good
[10:14] man is not at home. He is gone a long
[10:19] journey.
[10:20] He hath taken a bag of money with him
[10:23] and he will come at the day appointed.
[10:26] Let's go to 21.
[10:28] With her much fair speech she caused him
[10:32] to yield.
[10:34] This is the the steps. With the
[10:37] flattering of her lips she forced him.
[10:40] So she this is where disbelief is really
[10:42] conceiving now. The the the sin. This is
[10:44] where it happens.
[10:46] He goeth after her straight way as an ox
[10:49] goeth to the slaughter
[10:52] or as a fool to the correction of the
[10:54] stocks. That's prison to a dark strike
[11:01] to a until a dart strike through his
[11:04] liver. Here here's where death is
[11:06] starting to come set in. As a bird
[11:08] hasteth to the snare and knoweth not
[11:11] that it is for his life. Right? That's
[11:14] what sin does. Look at this image here.
[11:16] Her house, the the house of sin, right?
[11:19] This is an illustration of adultery, but
[11:21] you you fill in the blank
[11:23] is the way to hell, going down to the
[11:26] chambers of death.
[11:30] So, here's the illustration between
[11:32] Proverbs 7 and James 1. Drawn away. In
[11:36] verse 8, it said, "Passing through the
[11:37] streets near her corner and he went away
[11:41] to her house." He was drawn away. and
[11:44] then lust. So in the twilight, right, in
[11:48] the black night, and behold, there met
[11:50] him a woman with an attire of a harlot,
[11:52] subtle of heart,
[11:55] and it was in ties, she caught him and
[11:57] kissed him. Verse 13. In verse 21, it
[11:59] says, "With her much fair speech,
[12:03] see that's what happened to Eve, right?
[12:04] There was another voice that
[12:06] contradicted. We either have faith or
[12:07] disbelieve. You have faith or sin.
[12:10] Believe or unbelief."
[12:12] So she started to believe in a lie,
[12:14] right? So with her much fair speech, she
[12:16] caused him to yield. With a flattering
[12:18] lips, she forced him. And then here's
[12:21] what happened in verse 23. Until a dart
[12:23] strike through his liver and knoweth not
[12:25] that it is for his life. But see before
[12:28] this happened, there were some
[12:29] instructions given in the same chapter.
[12:30] You can note there the first five verses
[12:32] of chapter 7 of Proverbs and the very
[12:36] last few verses of the same chapter 7.
[12:39] Look at the instructions that they were
[12:40] given precisely against that topic. The
[12:43] strange woman.
[12:45] Proverbs 7. My son, keep my words and
[12:48] lay up my commandments with thee.
[12:52] Keep my commandments and live in my law
[12:55] as the apple of an eye. Bind them upon
[12:59] thy fingers. Write them upon the table
[13:02] of thine heart. Say unto wisdom, Thou
[13:05] are my sister.
[13:07] and call understanding my king's woman
[13:10] cousin or something that they may keep
[13:14] thee from the strange woman
[13:17] from the strange which flatterth with
[13:19] her words which lies which unbelief
[13:22] which antichrist
[13:25] teaching right
[13:27] proverb 7 see it starts and it ends
[13:29] here's the 24 verse where it ends was
[13:31] with the instruction hearken unto me now
[13:33] therefore all ye children and attend to
[13:36] the words of my mouth Let not thine
[13:38] heart decline to her ways. Go not astray
[13:41] in her paths. See, it's a very concise
[13:44] chapter. It's all about that topic. And
[13:47] and we saw what happened between verse 6
[13:49] and 23.
[13:51] But it it started with the instruction
[13:54] and it ended with the instruction for
[13:56] her ha verse 26. For she hath cast down
[13:59] many wounded. Yeah. Many strong men
[14:04] sin. Many strong men have been slain by
[14:07] her, that house of death, the house of
[14:10] sin. Proverbs 5 is a very similar um
[14:13] concept. My son, attend to wisdom and
[14:15] bow thy near unto understanding. You see
[14:17] how it starts with the instruction
[14:18] again. That thou may regard discretion.
[14:22] It's a very important thing. Discretion
[14:24] that thy lips may keep knowledge for
[14:27] thou for the lips or the other lips now,
[14:29] not the lips of knowledge of a strange
[14:30] woman drop as a honeycomb. You see the
[14:32] the copycat here where you know the the
[14:35] word is as sweet as a honeycomb and and
[14:37] it says and her mouth is smoother than
[14:39] oil but her ant is bitter as warmwood
[14:42] sharp as a two-edged sword. Where have
[14:44] you heard that before? Now it's not a
[14:46] two-edged sword. It's ass. Kind of like
[14:49] like the lion, right? Satan is not a
[14:51] lion. He's roaring ass a lion. He has no
[14:54] teeth. So it it's it's really a
[14:57] perversion, right, of the original. So
[15:00] but it is here. It's trying to do the
[15:02] opposite of of what it's a two-edged
[15:04] sword, but it does something different
[15:06] than what God's two-edged sword does,
[15:08] right? And it's pretending to do that.
[15:09] Proverbs 5 and six in parallel. So her
[15:12] feet go I'll go a breeze through this
[15:14] because then I want to get us out of
[15:15] this house of sin that we're walking
[15:17] through here to exploring. So her feet
[15:20] go down to death, her steps take hold of
[15:24] hell, lest thou shouldest ponder the
[15:27] path of life. Her ways are movable, not
[15:29] immovable, that thou cast not know them.
[15:32] Hear me now, therefore, oh ye children,
[15:35] and depart not from the words of my
[15:37] mouth. Remove thy way. See, that's
[15:39] different than being drawn away. Far
[15:42] from her, and cup not nigh, he was kind
[15:45] of lingering around the corner,
[15:46] remember? Nigh the door of her house,
[15:49] the house of sin. Lest thou give thine
[15:53] honor unto others, and thy years
[15:58] unto the cruel, lest strangers be filled
[16:02] with thy wealth that took you so long to
[16:05] to attain, and thy labors be in the
[16:08] house of a stranger.
[16:11] And thou mourn at the last, when thy
[16:14] flesh and thy body are consumed, and
[16:16] say, How have I hated instruction, and
[16:19] my heart despised reproof, and have not
[16:22] obeyed the voice
[16:25] of my teachers, nor inclined mine ears
[16:27] to them that instructed me, Bible,
[16:29] right? Message. So, Proverbs 7, drink
[16:31] waters out of thine own system. So, why
[16:33] would it say that in this relation to
[16:35] this and running waters out of thine own
[16:38] well?
[16:40] It's in relationship to stay to your
[16:42] own. Stay to what what's rightfully
[16:44] yours. Because remember sin is
[16:45] righteousness perverted. So let thy
[16:48] fountain be blessed and rejoice with the
[16:50] wife of thy youth. Whatever is your lot,
[16:52] you know, whatever my lot, he has taught
[16:54] me to say it is well with my soul. If
[16:55] your lot is to be a chasteed unto the
[16:58] Lord, to be a single person, to be a
[17:01] bachelor, to be a married person, to be
[17:02] a grandma, to be someone who has couple
[17:05] has gone by. It's is keep with your
[17:08] fountain. It's let it be blessed and
[17:11] rejoice with what what you have. Let her
[17:14] be the word whatever God's comfort in
[17:16] your life. Be as a loving high in a
[17:18] pleasant role. Let her breast satisfy
[17:20] thee at all times. Be thou ravish always
[17:24] with her love. Love what the Lord has
[17:27] done for you and is doing for you.
[17:29] Because look what he says here in the
[17:30] message in uh power of transformation 65
[17:32] random speaking says now he deformed
[17:35] these seeds talking about perversion.
[17:37] Now he could not destroy them. He just
[17:39] deformed them. Now we realize that sin
[17:43] is righteousness perverted. It's just
[17:46] that a lie is a truth misrepresented.
[17:49] See anything in adultery is the right
[17:51] act that God ordained just took in the
[17:55] wrong way. See anything and death
[17:59] is a perversion of life. Just that death
[18:03] just takes see deforms life.
[18:07] Death cannot produce life though.
[18:10] And continuing on verse 5, chapter 5
[18:12] verse 20 of Proverbs. And why will thou
[18:15] my son be ravished with the strange
[18:18] woman and embrace the bosom of a
[18:21] stranger? Why would you get outside of
[18:23] God's protection of of his word and go
[18:26] do something else that's not for you?
[18:28] You you have plenty of garden to live
[18:30] life in and to take comfort, to take
[18:33] nutrients, to take distress, to take to
[18:36] be rested, to to decompress, I meant to
[18:38] say, from stress. For the ways of men
[18:41] are before the eyes of the Lord, and he
[18:43] ponderth all his goingings, all his
[18:46] goingings everywhere he goes. His own
[18:48] iniquity shall take the wicked himself,
[18:51] and his own iniquities, remember, by his
[18:53] own lust. And he shall beholden with the
[18:56] courts of his sins, his sins, his
[18:59] disbelief. He shall die without
[19:01] instruction. If you don't have
[19:02] instruction, and in the greatness of his
[19:05] folly foolishness, he shall go astray,
[19:08] drawn away. Verse chapter 6. And it
[19:12] says, "For the commandment is a lamp and
[19:14] allow the way of life. I I'll breeze
[19:16] through here to keep thee from the evil
[19:17] woman, from the strange woman, right?
[19:19] That that she wants to lust after her."
[19:22] It says, "Lust not after her beauty in
[19:24] thine heart, neither let her take thee
[19:28] with her eyelids.
[19:30] For by means of a horish woman, a man is
[19:32] brought to a piece of bread." And the
[19:35] adulteress will hunt for the precious
[19:37] life. Can a man take fire from the bosom
[19:40] and his clothes not be burned or smoked
[19:42] or stenched? Can one go up upon hot
[19:45] coals and his feet not be burned despite
[19:47] what you see on TV? So he had goth. So,
[19:51] so he that goeth to his neighbor's wife,
[19:54] whosoever toucheth
[19:57] her shall not be innocent.
[19:59] John 8:34 Jesus answered then, "Verily,
[20:02] verily I say unto you, whosoever
[20:04] committh sin is a servant of sin." In
[20:06] Hebrews 3, he says, "But exhort one
[20:08] another daily while it is called today,
[20:11] lest any of you be hardened
[20:15] through the deceitfulness
[20:17] of sin." Sin is a deceit. You saw the
[20:20] the regression of it. Be not deceived.
[20:23] Again, Galatians uh 6:7, God is not
[20:26] mocked, for whatsoever a man seweth,
[20:29] that shall he also reap. I'll go fast
[20:31] because I got some stronger scriptures
[20:33] at the end. John 16. And when he has
[20:36] come, he will reprove the world of sin
[20:38] and of righteousness and of judgment of
[20:41] sin because they believe not on me. See,
[20:44] sin is unbelief. this Bible message. I
[20:46] know this message came to us and it told
[20:48] us these things, but it's in the
[20:50] scripture. Here's another scripture for
[20:51] it. John 8, I said, "Therefore unto you
[20:54] that ye shall die in your sins. For if
[20:58] ye believe not that I am he,
[21:02] ye shall die in your sins." Remember, he
[21:05] who does not believe is condemned
[21:07] already.
[21:09] Brother Brandon brought that a lot in
[21:11] the ministry explained 50. Brother
[21:12] Brandham says, "What is sin?" Question.
[21:14] What is sin? Two question same question.
[21:16] Not drinking, not smoking, not gambling,
[21:18] not rejecting church. Sin is unbelief.
[21:21] It is the right. I mean, excuse me. Is
[21:24] that right? He that believeth not is
[21:26] condemned already. See, you're you're
[21:29] not you don't you're not destroyed or
[21:32] separated from God because you're a
[21:34] sinner. You're separated from it says
[21:37] you're separated to God or from God
[21:39] because you refuse to walk with him to
[21:42] walk in his provided way.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; In Galatians 6:8 it says, "For he that
[21:47] sweth to this flesh shall reap shall of
[21:51] the flesh reap corruption and but he
[21:53] that sweth to the spirit shall of the
[21:56] spirit reap life everlasting." And in
[21:59] Acts here we see and he commanded us to
[22:02] preach unto the people and to testify
[22:04] that it is he which hath ordained of God
[22:08] to be the judge of the quick the living
[22:11] and the dead. To him give all the
[22:14] prophets witness that through his name
[22:17] whosoever believeth in him shall receive
[22:20] remission of sins. While Peter yet spoke
[22:23] these words that I just read, the Holy
[22:26] Ghost fell on all them which heard the
[22:29] word. So the prudence temptation
[22:32] progression. In the same book in chapter
[22:34] one, I'm speeding up here in James, you
[22:36] saw 14 and 15 and we saw how um that was
[22:39] sin's regression when a temptation
[22:42] happened. But if you it actually starts
[22:44] with James 2 and 4 which actually speaks
[22:47] about the same temptation on a children
[22:50] or a believer and actually you'll see
[22:52] the difference response. So it produced
[22:55] maturity, endurance, faith, joy,
[22:57] patience. Let's read on. So remember it
[23:01] says here in James 1:24, "My brethren,
[23:04] count it all joy when so talking about
[23:06] the brethren now. when ye fall into
[23:09] diverse temptations, diverse many of
[23:11] them, knowing this, that the triangle of
[23:14] your faith workketh patience, but let
[23:17] patience have her perfect work,
[23:18] maturity, that ye may be perfect and
[23:22] tired, wanting nothing. Different
[23:25] result, right? So, we do know that, and
[23:28] we're going to the wrapping of of uh the
[23:31] conclusion here. So, well, here's
[23:34] another's man response to the same
[23:38] temptation.
[23:40] Joseph, a perfect type. Remember, not
[23:42] that he was perfect, but he was a
[23:44] perfect type of Jesus, brother said.
[23:46] Genesis 39:10-12.
[23:48] And it came to pass as she spake to
[23:51] Joseph day by day, same concept as
[23:53] Proverbs 7, that he hearkened not unto
[23:55] her to lie by her or to be with her. And
[23:59] it came to pass about this time that
[24:01] Joseph went into the house to do his
[24:04] business. So the purpose of the motive
[24:07] was right. And there was none of them,
[24:10] none of the men of the house there
[24:12] within. And she caught him just like on
[24:15] the other one, right? By his garment,
[24:17] saying, "Lie with me." And he left his
[24:20] garment in her hand and fled and got him
[24:23] out. Amen. So, and in here, uh, time um,
[24:27] fails us, but here's a good contrast
[24:29] between the I versus the me in Romans 7,
[24:32] like between verses, uh, 14 to 25, where
[24:35] it kind of goes back and forth. I don't
[24:37] want to do this, but I do. And here's a
[24:39] list of the me talking about the outer
[24:41] man and the I speaking about the inner
[24:43] man. So, that's a good contrast of of
[24:46] how it happened. And to wrap it up here
[24:48] for the message of this age,
[24:51] it's been a controversy for many time.
[24:53] It's uh 1 John 1 and two
[24:57] in contrast with 1 John 3 and five
[25:00] because we've read where we said he
[25:02] who's born of God does not commit a sin.
[25:04] But we also read where it says that if
[25:07] we say that we have not sinned, we lie
[25:09] and make God a liar.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; So here's the balance. So you want to
[25:13] just go to those scriptures one John 1
[25:15] and two, 1 John 3 and five. Here's what
[25:19] we have. First John 1. But if we walk in
[25:22] the light as he is in the light, we have
[25:24] fellowship one with another and the
[25:25] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[25:27] us from all sin. But if we say that we
[25:29] have no sin, we deceive ourselves and
[25:33] the truth is not in us. If we confess
[25:35] our sins, he is faithful and just to
[25:37] forgive us our sin and to cleanse us
[25:39] from all unrighteousness. Look at the
[25:41] context here. If we say we have not
[25:44] sinned, past tense,
[25:47] it's not so much saying, you know,
[25:49] sinner or unbeliever. It's basically
[25:50] saying if you it's saying it this is the
[25:52] way you ask for forgiveness. It's first
[25:54] John. He's developing the the the letter
[25:58] here. So just do look at the context
[26:00] here. A lot of people have taken this
[26:01] and just ran with it and kind of put
[26:02] them side by side. I went through a lot
[26:05] of scriptures and parallels Spanish
[26:07] English and I realized that this speaks
[26:08] completely in the past tense. So it says
[26:10] if we say that we have not sinned
[26:14] because it's telling you how to ask for
[26:16] forgiveness when you mess up. Okay? And
[26:18] I know that you've been raptured in the
[26:20] soul, but you still have a spirit to
[26:22] contend with and a flesh that is
[26:24] neutral, but you can flow through good
[26:26] things or bad things out of it depending
[26:28] what who's in the tower.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And maketh him a liar and his word
[26:31] is not in us. First John 2:12 starts now
[26:34] with the recommendation. My little
[26:35] children, these things I write unto you
[26:37] that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we
[26:41] have an advocate with the father. Look
[26:43] at the context. Jesus Christ the
[26:44] righteous. And he is the propitiation
[26:47] for our sins and not for ours only but
[26:51] also for the sins of the whole world.
[26:53] And first John says I write unto you
[26:55] little children because your sins are
[26:57] forgiven you for his name's sake. See
[27:00] the hope here. So it's not about judging
[27:02] or judgment. It's about 1 John 3:46.
[27:05] This is what happens in the soul. Now
[27:07] whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
[27:09] also the law. For sin is the
[27:11] transgression of the law. And ye know
[27:14] that he was manifested to take away our
[27:17] sins and in his in him is no sin. Right?
[27:21] So whosoever abideth in him sinnth not.
[27:25] Whosoever sinnth
[27:28] hath not seen him neither known him. And
[27:31] it says little children, let no man
[27:33] deceive you that he So may he that doth
[27:36] righteousness is righteousness even as
[27:39] as he is righteous. He that committh sin
[27:41] of is of the devil. For the devil sinnth
[27:44] from the beginning, for his purpose, for
[27:46] this purpose, the son of God was
[27:48] manifested that he might destroy.
[27:50] Brother Bannon taught a lot about this,
[27:52] the works of the devil. So that's the
[27:54] purpose here. Whosoever is born, the
[27:57] inner man now of God does not command
[27:59] sin in the soul. We believe, right, by
[28:01] the number of birth, for his seed
[28:03] remainth in him, and he cannot sin
[28:06] because he is born of God. And five it
[28:09] says, "We know that whosoever is born of
[28:11] God sinnth not." Wrapping up here, "But
[28:13] he that is begotten of God keepeth
[28:16] himself, and that wicked one toucheth
[28:19] him not." Touch not the oil and the
[28:21] wine.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews. For we have not a high
[28:25] priest which cannot be touched by the
[28:27] filling of our infirmities, but was in
[28:29] all points tempted
[28:32] like as we are yet without sin. That's
[28:36] our example in our but the scripture
[28:38] hath concluded all understand that the
[28:41] promise by faith of Jesus Christ might
[28:44] be given to them that believe but before
[28:46] faith came we were kept under the law
[28:49] shut up unto the faith which should
[28:52] afterwards be revealed to faith that's
[28:55] revealed and in Romans 6 for sin shall
[28:57] not have dominion over you for ye are
[29:01] not under the law but under grace. Amen.
[29:04] For as much then as Christ hath suffered
[29:07] for us in the flesh, arm yourself with
[29:10] the same mind. For he that hath
[29:14] suffered, look at this. In the flesh
[29:16] hath ceased from sin. A lot of times
[29:19] wonder why we're corrected. That he no
[29:22] longer should live the rest of his time
[29:25] in the flesh. If you suffer in the
[29:27] flesh, it's a deterrent from sin to the
[29:31] lusts of men.
[29:34] but to do the will of God. Amen. And
[29:36] brother man goes a lot to say you never
[29:37] did it to begin with. Justify stands
[29:39] through as never sin at the first place.
[29:42] You are standing completely. You never
[29:44] sin at the first time at the first
[29:46] place. God don't even know nothing. It's
[29:48] in the sea of forgetfulness. You never
[29:50] did it. You never It's just you never it
[29:52] it says you were accused of it by the
[29:55] accuser. But readily from the beginning
[29:58] you were predestined to be a son and or
[30:00] and a daughter of God. You're standing
[30:02] there washed and your old book of
[30:05] divorcement is put away and it's dead.
[30:08] Absolutely out of existence. Even in the
[30:10] mind of God, you're the virtuous bride
[30:12] of Christ, washed in the blood of
[30:14] Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son
[30:16] of God, standing with a pure,
[30:19] unadultered bride word that he washed by
[30:23] the water of his own blood that become
[30:27] flesh and manifested that he might take
[30:30] you with which were predestined in the
[30:33] bosom of the father before the
[30:35] beginning, the same as he was. He was
[30:39] that great attribute of God called love.
[30:42] From sense regression to faith
[30:44] progression. God bless you brothers.
[30:46] Amen. Praise the Lord.
