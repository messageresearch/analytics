[4:33] you'd like to turn in your scriptures we
[4:36] have a couple of questions that we want
[4:38] to cover this morning and we'll try to
[4:42] get that part and you know so go to
[4:45] Colossians where we've been reading and
[4:48] first Corinthians now remember the Bible
[4:52] study this coming Saturday
[4:54] remember that ring with the spring
[4:56] festival will be the 13th so remember
[5:00] these you know and keep everything in
[5:03] mind the Lord willing Wade will be we're
[5:06] gonna put him back into rotation and get
[5:09] him back in and with we like for him to
[5:11] go other place and preach we would like
[5:13] him to preach here so he's going to
[5:15] minister this evening and try to give us
[5:17] a report from all of the things and then
[5:20] if he don't finish he's just going over
[5:22] to Wednesday night and finish up them
[5:25] and take care of it okay all right so
[5:27] remember these announcement any other
[5:29] announcement then we're all of the sick
[5:31] ones among us there's many many
[5:33] sicknesses many things you know we don't
[5:38] have to accept the fact that we're
[5:40] getting older but that is a fact and
[5:42] it's happening but all we got to do is
[5:45] just keep saying by stripes I'm healed
[5:47] saying thank you Lord for it
[5:49] and I believe it'll just be made
[5:52] manifest don't you all right Colossians
[5:55] 3 in first corinthians father we thank
[5:57] you for this day and we thank you for
[6:00] your love your grace your kindness thank
[6:03] you for you we just ask you now that
[6:05] you'd come among this Lord and that you
[6:08] would first cleanse us from all sin and
[6:10] unrighteousness to make us all worthy
[6:12] for you to come into our presence and to
[6:15] dwell with each one of us and we ask you
[6:17] to help us remember the sick ones among
[6:19] us just touch each one of these lords
[6:22] that are having to view in and all we
[6:24] thank you for that opportunity that
[6:26] things can be done like that but we
[6:28] don't
[6:29] or in the fact that we can use it we
[6:32] just use it for your glory so we ask you
[6:35] to guide each one of us in this have
[6:36] your way forgive our sins most of all
[6:39] cause that's what we want to be covered
[6:41] and be completing you keep us now as we
[6:44] try to speak your word and try to answer
[6:47] questions and things Lord and you just
[6:49] have your way in Jesus name Amen
[6:54] so we'll just read the scriptures we
[6:56] don't because it was on the par but
[6:58] we'll go to Colossians 3 and we'll just
[7:01] pick up verse 10 and have put on the new
[7:05] man which is renewed in knowledge after
[7:09] the image of him that created him see
[7:12] that's Genesis 1 right ok where there is
[7:17] neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or
[7:19] uncircumcision barbarian Cynthia bond
[7:22] they're free but Christ is all and in
[7:26] all
[7:26] they men so let's go over down to
[7:30] Corinthians where we've been reading
[7:32] from we'll go to verse 15 chapter 15
[7:35] verse 26
[7:37] well I stood enemy that shall be
[7:38] destroyed his death for he has put all
[7:41] things under his feet
[7:43] but when he said to all things are put
[7:45] under him it is manifest that he is
[7:48] excepted which is which did put all
[7:52] things under him in other words this
[7:53] manifest he is complete he's done he's
[7:56] doing it is what he's doing not what
[7:58] we're doing okay and why all things
[8:01] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[8:04] son also himself be subject unto him
[8:07] that put all things under him that God
[8:10] may be all in all you may be seated the
[8:15] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[8:18] the word now we covered this past
[8:23] Wednesday and bringing forth you know
[8:27] what we've been trying I thought we
[8:29] would try to get it to an end on that
[8:31] but really what it's done is just
[8:33] unfolded to more of the same thing but
[8:35] it won't be the same point so we'll be
[8:38] picking up in moving on you know into
[8:41] that
[8:42] as we go along and you'll see how I
[8:45] believe the Lord willing that it ties
[8:47] together you that how the note for this
[8:50] morning put them up and keep them for
[8:53] next week because that way we won't have
[8:55] to make no new ones and that way we'll
[8:58] give you a whole week that you can read
[8:59] you can figure out what I'm gonna try to
[9:02] say you know all of that so just do it
[9:06] that way alright so let's just get into
[9:09] thought we have some questions to do on
[9:12] another part that I'll wait till later
[9:14] to try to cover that but this is just
[9:19] specifically to the time right where we
[9:21] were Wednesday in trying to minister you
[9:26] know in all an hour I wish you would
[9:28] listen to that message again not a time
[9:31] that good of a minister but if you can
[9:33] retain all the things I said in that
[9:35] message Wednesday night by listening one
[9:38] time are you in a hurry I can even
[9:42] though I said it that's a good way of
[9:47] saying it well we got a couple of
[9:50] questions it would be related right into
[9:52] the area and see they didn't a person
[9:55] facing the knows question didn't know
[9:57] that I had this top part of my notes for
[10:01] this morning to make sure and Express
[10:03] something so it's the very thing that I
[10:06] have written down you know to work in
[10:08] alright question number one in the new
[10:11] heaven and new earth there's all three
[10:13] sons named come to an end like you've
[10:16] got son of God son of man son of David
[10:20] so that God will be all and in all
[10:24] all right now I'm like this even though
[10:30] I'll cover it in a minute even though we
[10:34] would talk about maybe redemption being
[10:39] over or this being done or that being
[10:42] done remember you will never forget I
[10:46] don't believe in eternity that you'll
[10:50] ever forget of his name here or anything
[10:55] Redemption all right because see I
[10:58] believe when we get diary list unfold
[11:00] more of the redemption but it'll still
[11:03] be that we'll know that he was the son
[11:04] of God son of man son of David we'll
[11:09] still know that but it'll be increased
[11:11] to give us better understanding of you
[11:17] know what it is it's not to do away it
[11:21] really means where it says that we read
[11:24] you know the son himself shall become
[11:26] subject he didn't do away see if you
[11:30] followed the way I was expressing it in
[11:33] the way the Prophet was bringing it said
[11:35] the kingdom that Jesus would give to the
[11:38] father
[11:39] all right see that something has to
[11:41] transport fire transpire into that do it
[11:45] but how did he say that it does
[11:47] he said God the Father would hover over
[11:52] the son
[11:54] in other words become one and to me it's
[11:58] the same thing as I said maybe we need
[12:00] to get in anointed one Nkosi I've seen
[12:02] that's what happened I believe that's
[12:04] what happened there on the River Jordan
[12:07] that people are so confused about to put
[12:10] them it's very simple he was born Lord
[12:13] to Christ he was Almighty God he didn't
[12:17] become God at the River Jordan
[12:19] he became anointed all right he didn't
[12:23] become the Messiah he became the
[12:26] Anointed Messiah all right see then that
[12:30] makes him too worth it it's just
[12:33] unfolding see when we get dire we won't
[12:35] forget this when I try to illustrate it
[12:38] I don't believe it'll be a a father over
[12:41] here or son over here and the Holy Ghost
[12:43] fluttering here anything like that I
[12:45] believe we'll see Jesus and know he is
[12:49] Almighty God because that was what he
[12:53] said he said if you've seen me you've
[12:54] seen the father
[12:55] well right what does the father look
[12:57] like the son what if the son looked like
[12:59] the father that's sensible that's not uh
[13:02] you know it's not a point something hard
[13:07] to understand it's just sensible
[13:09] it's plain language to say the that what
[13:14] happens each one of those manifestations
[13:17] God has many manifestations all right
[13:20] see he's a road to sharing the lily the
[13:22] valley the bright and Morning Star none
[13:24] of that will be forgotten or done away
[13:26] with
[13:28] yeah it'll never be it won't be none of
[13:31] that will be done away with all of it
[13:33] just keeps you what would you call it
[13:35] it keeps spreading out more all right
[13:40] becoming greater in our understanding
[13:43] many manifestations let's see you know I
[13:47] mean I'm at the house and and you know
[13:50] me and nany weird are at the house by
[13:52] ourselves well see you'd say well only
[13:55] you ain't nothing but a husband no as
[13:59] long as I have children there somewhere
[14:01] there's no one in thinking about me it's
[14:04] being a father what's in it she calls me
[14:06] daddy I call her mama
[14:08] you know it's not the point of trying to
[14:10] to be it's the point of understanding
[14:13] who we are you know we follow that point
[14:17] you know you know and see it'll never be
[14:19] don't ever think about God anything in
[14:23] God being done away with because if if
[14:27] you could do away with God how you know
[14:30] it just don't work okay so think of that
[14:33] as the increase brother mote had a way
[14:36] of expressing like God you know we think
[14:40] of God as as being like an apple
[14:42] you know you cut it up brother I'm
[14:44] talking about you your your the way you
[14:46] try to express it and and brother Moe
[14:49] had it like this he said you take an
[14:50] apple you cut it up and you give it out
[14:53] where you just run out of pieces
[14:54] well you've run out of God but that's
[14:57] incorrect see if you're gonna take the
[15:00] Apple you cut to pieces hand it out and
[15:02] more grows back that Apple keeps getting
[15:05] bigger and bigger instead of running out
[15:08] see that's that's the way God does
[15:10] things because his is entirely different
[15:12] from than the way we do things because
[15:15] he can do it he's increasing in
[15:22] that are decreasing and let's see what
[15:24] was that word that thinking what are you
[15:26] expanding himself yeah that's been about
[15:30] 50 some years ago yeah he preached don't
[15:33] expanding himself
[15:34] alright see if this keeps unfolding
[15:38] unfolding unfolding so that it's not
[15:41] doing away in other words will be
[15:42] sitting there in the future home with
[15:44] him but will know him as this or that or
[15:48] the other but that was the pointed I
[15:50] wrote down do you realize in the future
[15:52] of home that's why me that's why the
[15:54] scripture said that God may be all and
[15:57] in all or all in all not now we covered
[16:04] it to where you wouldn't understand it
[16:07] doesn't mean everybody in the world's
[16:08] got the Holy Ghost now we know better
[16:11] than that
[16:12] they don't mean all in all like that
[16:14] well everybody's going to be saved
[16:16] because the Bible said God is all in all
[16:18] no not that away but remember you know
[16:23] brother Donnie had asked me a little bit
[16:25] yesterday on something
[16:26] just remember this point this is the
[16:28] best way I can comprehend what will take
[16:31] place when we leave this world
[16:33] and going on into the millennium in the
[16:35] future home and thing is to think about
[16:41] there is a bride all right and that's
[16:47] what it's talking about that God may be
[16:50] all and in all
[16:52] he's going to be in the bride because
[16:55] he's going to give her eternal life in
[16:57] their soul right here right all right
[17:01] but now what about those that are given
[17:03] eternal life what about the Jews what
[17:06] about the the foolish virgins what about
[17:09] those there'll be people be given
[17:13] eternal life but now the eternal life
[17:16] that's given to them is an impartation
[17:20] Adam it was imparted to Adam he turn a
[17:24] life Adam never had a new birth because
[17:28] he wouldn't know a new Burt in the Old
[17:30] Testament so you didn't have that away
[17:31] so Adam was imparted
[17:34] you know eternal life see the foolish
[17:38] virgins and people like that to choose
[17:40] all who ever get eternal life you know
[17:43] after this world I'll put it that way it
[17:47] will be an impartation seeing an
[17:50] impartation is not a birth so do you see
[17:55] the difference in the bride and who she
[17:57] is
[17:58] we are his children where his out spring
[18:01] we are him made manifest in another form
[18:05] called a bride all right see that's not
[18:09] it just an impartation that's something
[18:13] that you receive yes
[18:16] but in God before the world ever begun
[18:19] he already knew who is going to receive
[18:21] it he already knew what would take place
[18:24] within the all and all see you said well
[18:28] it's just a bride no it's not just a
[18:30] ride no oh we'll get to it cuz I got the
[18:36] notes for the next message coming on in
[18:39] the future home do you realize in the
[18:42] future home that the bride can live in
[18:46] the city other people can't live in the
[18:49] city but now if they are now here's the
[18:57] wording if they are redeemed if they get
[19:04] eternal life that is the eternal life of
[19:09] God but what's the difference between
[19:13] them what's the difference between the
[19:16] ones that are nations and the thing and
[19:18] the bride it's what it is it's the way
[19:23] it comes the bride is part of him then
[19:27] remember what we gave from brother
[19:28] Branham God is not complete runaround
[19:30] sin without you you realize if the bride
[19:35] is and the prophet said it she is the
[19:38] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[19:41] that's not talking about every person in
[19:44] the world I told about the Bride of
[19:46] Christ
[19:46] all right see then when it says the all
[19:50] and all you've got to put that on to
[19:53] first the bride and she gets eternal
[19:58] life making her the offspring of God we
[20:04] see the foolish virgins they only go if
[20:06] the father's they can go is
[20:08] sanctification they can't go to the
[20:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right see
[20:13] there will be people giving eternal life
[20:17] I'll think about it
[20:19] people will give an eternal life which
[20:21] would be more because they would
[20:23] remember there was Nina representing the
[20:26] rapture and Noah represented foolish
[20:30] virgins and the things see that's eight
[20:31] times more of them so there'd be a whole
[20:35] lot more people giving eternal life
[20:38] somewhere else down the road we're not
[20:41] concerned with that we get eternal life
[20:43] here that's what makes us the bride the
[20:49] greatest the Jews can be to come back
[20:52] into the way that it's supposed to be
[20:54] still they will never be the bride
[20:58] now people out of the Jews people out of
[21:02] the nations that can be part of the
[21:04] Bride of Christ right all right BC one
[21:07] gamma
[21:08] when you say all in all look who's
[21:13] talking about in Colossians it plainly
[21:18] tells you who is talking about universe
[21:21] did you catch that
[21:32] and now put on the new man who's this
[21:38] the born-again Christian which is the is
[21:43] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[21:46] him that created him goes all the way
[21:48] back to Genesis the new creation so then
[21:53] you you understand what I'm saying then
[21:56] when you say all in all
[21:58] look who's talking about you remember
[22:01] the story I Ellis trait it over and over
[22:03] why are you out by doing it but still at
[22:06] least you ought to get to pulling little
[22:08] run said you know we're so mixed up in
[22:10] our language do we we can't understand
[22:12] what say it and say you say board that
[22:18] can be a lot of different words but if
[22:21] you explain what you're talking about
[22:24] the board can be that board can be on
[22:27] different words but if you say come on
[22:30] board stand on this board and I'm bored
[22:37] with you we'll see you before and the
[22:41] after has explained what you're talking
[22:43] about
[22:44] so is it with the scriptures in the
[22:51] scriptures it will explain what is
[22:54] talking about if you'll read what it's
[22:56] talking to the context it's in our who's
[23:00] it talking to so then the all and all
[23:04] think it's bride all right you got that
[23:12] that's a group of people that's a
[23:14] special designation of himself that says
[23:17] in the church age book alright they
[23:21] receive eternal life here at the new
[23:23] birth but these others is going to
[23:26] receive eternal life later alright see
[23:32] then they can be the all in all as to me
[23:36] is why the Bible says it like that
[23:37] what's the difference in eternal life in
[23:39] you are the eternal life given to a
[23:41] foolish
[23:42] the eternal life is society right if she
[23:48] turn alive but it's the difference in
[23:51] who it is - and the people it's -
[23:55] alright so then when you're looking at
[23:58] it see all right in the new heaven and
[24:03] new earth
[24:04] there's all three suns come to an end
[24:07] so God something man some David so that
[24:10] God will be all in all
[24:12] oh they don't come to an end there's
[24:15] still manifestations they're still
[24:18] taking things taking place when you and
[24:21] I walk off of this earth right 144,000
[24:27] is gonna get eternal life
[24:29] right but that don't make them bride
[24:32] they rejected that that's where the
[24:35] prophecy explains these things that we
[24:38] in organized religions we didn't have
[24:40] enough understanding to be able to place
[24:43] it in order but he explains it all right
[24:48] so then that group that gets the eternal
[24:51] life in the bride if you'll be inside
[24:54] the city convinced for later she'd live
[24:57] in the city but those that are given
[25:00] eternal life that are not bride they
[25:04] can't come and live in the city you tell
[25:07] how eternal life there won't be no death
[25:15] no sorrows won't be done to that dark
[25:17] botella they just won't be bribed I mean
[25:21] to me that's that means the whole Bible
[25:25] is unfolded us that we understand all
[25:27] right now watch see then God will be
[25:31] all-in all over the time the future home
[25:34] comes to pies all read it deforms will
[25:39] be completed right all redemptive forms
[25:46] will be completed but it won't do away
[25:49] with the name that's where I differ with
[25:51] the people of the message that's what
[25:53] they're trying to find
[25:55] either trying to find some new name I
[25:58] don't I don't go that route is the name
[26:03] of Jesus gonna be done away with how can
[26:08] it be done away with when you got your
[26:10] kings of the earth that brain girl glory
[26:13] and honor into the city they're still in
[26:19] the point of understanding what takes
[26:23] place don't you thank me and you will be
[26:26] understanding his name may change his
[26:35] name may change you may get a new name
[26:37] all right
[26:39] have no problems but it'll never do away
[26:43] with his all-night me and then he got
[26:46] married all right when we got married
[26:49] she took on a new knight right it didn't
[26:55] change mine it changed hers she got a
[26:59] new knight but did her new name make
[27:02] that something unrelated to me know
[27:09] everything she receives is related to me
[27:14] so what didn't she ever forget my name
[27:19] no you don't do that so the children
[27:23] come along as an increase of my name
[27:28] right she never goes back to her he's
[27:32] increasing by name all right
[27:34] more manifestation in my name grandkids
[27:38] come along more manifestation of my name
[27:41] great grandkids come along more
[27:45] manifestations in my night well then she
[27:49] can call me daddy
[27:51] I'm not her daddy but in the gospel I'm
[27:57] her daddy
[27:58] her father she can have different
[28:02] meanings to that then why are we trying
[28:05] to find some new name
[28:08] because we're trying to find a rabbit
[28:10] out of a hat trick to get us out of here
[28:13] that's the best way I will say it after
[28:15] 50 years looking and what people are
[28:18] trying to do trying to find something
[28:20] that can get them out of here instead of
[28:23] believing the word is here and receiving
[28:26] that word all right what do you follow
[28:28] now listen because they said on here
[28:32] there's no son's name in the new heaven
[28:36] and earth
[28:37] well it doesn't list it in the Bible now
[28:39] it doesn't give a name in the Bible that
[28:45] he changes from Jesus or anything it
[28:48] doesn't do that we go with the Prophet
[28:50] we believe it all right but yours my
[28:54] point about the new name but uh this is
[28:56] where I look at if you're the Bride of
[28:59] Christ now every morning I wake my wife
[29:11] up well what would you do walk in waking
[29:17] life up you know you guys what do you do
[29:21] if you don't wake her up
[29:24] she tell you what I say I say the same
[29:28] thing every morning Dona
[29:30] I don't say Peggy nanny I say Sleeping
[29:39] Beauty wake up
[29:42] see that's something between her and me
[29:45] I don't call you up and say Sleeping
[29:49] Beauty wake up cause I don't have
[29:55] anything to do with anybody else besides
[29:58] me and her now you know what I'm talking
[30:00] about Lisa Nene she's nee nee naw naw
[30:05] naw naw if you've got 1,400 ways of
[30:08] saying Nene but Terence has got a
[30:13] private name for her that he says you
[30:18] know Wade's got a private name for Jim
[30:22] you got a private name for your wife
[30:25] right it's something in relationship to
[30:30] you go write whether if you say
[30:35] sweetheart honey whatever you know it's
[30:38] just see that's what I see about in your
[30:41] name when we get dark the bride in that
[30:45] city the MINIX it's the next week
[30:50] when we get there in that city it'll be
[30:55] a never-ending unfolding of the name of
[30:58] Almighty God and you will never lose the
[31:04] name of Jesus I don't believe that yeah
[31:10] but if he gets a new name you don't need
[31:11] that hey let's reason a little if he
[31:17] gets in your name it only has to do with
[31:19] a pet name for the bride who's them
[31:22] other people don't call it who's in
[31:26] people outside the city that's coming in
[31:28] now who look what are they gonna call me
[31:30] they can't call him the new name because
[31:33] there's no way to pronounce you
[31:35] hey come on they having trouble with JV
[31:37] hates you j vh v you you can't pronounce
[31:41] it let alone getting there yeah I was
[31:45] used to but one of these days we'll get
[31:46] a new name then we'll be changed
[31:53] all right but will it do away with the
[31:56] name of Jesus
[31:57] no we'll always know that he was son of
[32:03] God son of man son of David it's none of
[32:06] Abraham you all here you'll never do
[32:11] away with Alpha and Omega beginning and
[32:16] end you'll never do away it just keep
[32:19] enhancing he keeps unveiling what he
[32:23] really is to each one of us
[32:25] come on I'm glad to see her company come
[32:27] in all right now let's go to part two in
[32:38] the Millennium does Jesus Christ
[32:41] continue to sit on his father's strong a
[32:43] son of David and then takes his own
[32:46] throne in the new heaven and new earth
[32:50] okay now the Father's throne is the
[32:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit to the
[32:59] company we're trying to we always say to
[33:02] you when you come one time your visitor
[33:04] two times you're part of us are welcome
[33:05] but we're trying to answer some
[33:08] questions that's why I love brother
[33:14] Branham the message like a deal I gave
[33:17] it to you in the message that I was
[33:20] preaching on brother Branham covers in
[33:22] the Millennium what will take place God
[33:26] will come down in the Millenium hover
[33:30] over that human flesh that we call Jesus
[33:33] and like the anointing that I was
[33:35] talking a minute ago at the River Jordan
[33:37] the anointing didn't make him a
[33:39] different God he just made that manifest
[33:42] right God will be all in all in the
[33:46] Millennium you know why cuz he's already
[33:50] all in all now do you you and me to the
[33:52] bride before the Millenium ever comes
[33:54] he's all in all she understands she
[33:57] knows who he is
[34:00] he's in the only difference between the
[34:03] future home and the millennium is
[34:06] because of the things that were going
[34:10] through in the Millennium he will hover
[34:15] over and show as himself as being one
[34:19] sitting on the throne because he is
[34:21] Father Son and Holy Ghost may manifest
[34:24] as one there's not three guards
[34:27] so in when the Prophet would cover the
[34:30] hovering over the that's in the
[34:33] Millennium Drive son of God son of man
[34:37] son of David son of David is the
[34:39] rightful throne of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:42] through the promise of the son of David
[34:45] which was the son of David and the
[34:47] natural with Solomon the spiritual son
[34:49] of David is the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:51] all right so he'll set on the throne in
[34:54] the Millennium but God will come down
[34:57] and so engulfed in all ways because
[35:00] remember God is the spirit you can't see
[35:04] he's got to have a form to reveal
[35:06] himself so he comes down in the
[35:10] Millennium but then as something happens
[35:14] we go into a future home and when you do
[35:20] then God becomes all in all he's all in
[35:25] all in the Millennium
[35:28] now listen you'll get the point he's all
[35:33] in all to you and I he's all in all when
[35:36] the Jews receive it he's all in all in
[35:39] the Millennium but remember
[35:41] there'll be people after the Millenium
[35:45] at the white throne that will receive
[35:49] eternal life you agree
[35:53] so then this thing is not finished see
[35:57] there'd be something about him that he
[35:59] can't fully make manifest in the
[36:01] Millennium even though God's it can
[36:04] become so one until we won't look at him
[36:08] and see two or three people running
[36:09] around we will see Jesus and know who he
[36:12] is we'll come riding back into the
[36:17] Millennium according to revelations 19
[36:19] to live a thousand years here with Jesus
[36:23] Christ and he'll be on the throne of
[36:25] David but he won't be distance son son
[36:29] of David - you and I you'll be the all
[36:31] and all there's still some Redemption
[36:36] left and that's what I've always said
[36:38] everybody wants to do away with this no
[36:41] Ellen if you're going to do it preach it
[36:44] correctly if you're going to give a new
[36:46] name tell me who it's - and how did it
[36:49] that it comes to pious because at the
[36:51] white throne he'll be there but we'll be
[36:57] sitting around him on many throne at the
[37:01] white throne and judging and people will
[37:08] be given eternal life as long as you're
[37:12] dealing with eternal life being given
[37:14] don't try to do away with a nun Jesus
[37:17] come Jesus means Redeemer anybody that
[37:21] ever gets eternal I get sits on the fact
[37:23] of Redeemer did you catch that season in
[37:27] the Millennium will see him as all in
[37:30] all will know who he is what's taking
[37:33] place called he'll be our husband and
[37:38] God can give us a private name that's
[37:40] fine but it won't never be made known to
[37:44] the world the world will always know him
[37:50] the foolish virgins of Juicer always
[37:53] will understand him as Jesus if you're
[37:57] trying to get him a new name
[37:59] just remember it'll only be a pet name
[38:02] that's the best way for me to say
[38:04] it'll be a pet name given between him
[38:07] and her that nobody else you said words
[38:11] the Bible it says will get a name that
[38:15] only we will know I can't tell you
[38:22] people's done that you know in the
[38:23] message I remember one brother you know
[38:25] he he had a lot of problems and a couple
[38:27] of hours but anyhow he wound up one of
[38:30] his wives told him what his new name was
[38:32] well that'd be pretty good for Peggy to
[38:36] tell you my new night hateful arrogant
[38:42] stubborn stupid come on Sarah what do
[38:52] you call it era dummy
[38:55] don't answer keep that quiet okay
[39:03] are you following me see there's a lot
[39:06] to the all and all I didn't have time to
[39:09] explain I was just putting it out in
[39:12] point but I got a question that will
[39:14] help us now to understand that part he's
[39:19] all in all too many groups of people but
[39:22] it takes in the finality in the future
[39:24] home in the finality of the future home
[39:27] dwelling on earth the new city all right
[39:31] see by that time everybody that's ever
[39:34] going to get eternal life will have it
[39:37] okay
[39:39] and by that the all in all will be there
[39:44] because he'll be all in all but that
[39:51] order these understanding to you right
[39:53] now that hey he's my Savior he's my God
[39:57] he's my healer he's my delivery he's my
[40:00] father
[40:02] he's my all and all and he's in all did
[40:09] you catch it is it the white throne
[40:12] there'll be people giving eternal life
[40:14] well the Millennium he can't be fully
[40:17] all in all coz there's something left
[40:20] will be the time to future home come
[40:22] into being the white throne everything's
[40:26] that happened he'll be all and in all
[40:35] the do you understand that he'll be all
[40:39] in all what cuz everybody's gonna have
[40:43] his life right are you following me
[40:47] with time you get to the future home
[40:49] those who have eternal life will be the
[40:52] life of Jesus Christ no matter what
[40:55] parts you put it in foolish virgins
[40:57] choose bride and the way I love it
[41:06] because you get eternal out here you
[41:09] ain't gonna look down on people die
[41:10] right you're gonna realize what God done
[41:17] for you alright now let's get the rest
[41:21] of this part because it they were saying
[41:24] them from the Prophet said it in the
[41:27] this day the scripture is fulfilled says
[41:30] the father strongly still in the
[41:32] Millennium that's right
[41:34] now watch my point that's written I told
[41:38] you these two things to remember Christ
[41:41] the mystery of God revealed brother
[41:42] branham is not explaining the future
[41:45] home the city he's explaining Jesus
[41:49] Christ coming into the millennial reign
[41:54] and he can be all in all in the
[41:58] millennial reign to you and I but they
[42:01] still Parks is to be revealed later
[42:03] though time he comes to the future home
[42:05] then at that time he's all and in all
[42:10] everybody that has eternal life will be
[42:14] part of his own life
[42:17] he said what what that's right we get in
[42:21] here what's the difference between the
[42:24] bride and the 144,000 they get eternal
[42:28] life after we leave out of here right
[42:31] but I don't like them bride foolish
[42:39] virgin gets eternal life that don't make
[42:42] them bride but you just keep on going
[42:48] till one day all is in all all right
[42:52] here's the quotation Jesus came in three
[42:56] names he came in Son of Man which was
[42:59] prophet and that's what he did he proved
[43:01] his ministry by being a prophet we all
[43:04] know that every one of us knows it he
[43:06] never said he was the son of God see
[43:08] Jesus never declared himself to be Sun
[43:10] God he declared himself to be the Son of
[43:12] man read Matthew Mark Luke and John all
[43:15] right he said he was the son of man now
[43:19] today he's the son of God which he he
[43:23] returned back and now he is in the form
[43:26] of the Holy Ghost the unseen person the
[43:29] new birth the Father's throne spirit
[43:31] within us right but yet God the Son of
[43:35] God in the Millennium he sits upon his
[43:37] Father's throne which he'll be son of
[43:41] David God sits on the throne what will
[43:48] you see there it won't be three Thrones
[43:51] that's what I've tried to get you to
[43:53] city that's what I kept asking the
[43:55] question when you get to the future home
[43:58] what do you expect to see
[44:06] I I see by revelation that Jesus is
[44:11] Almighty God is that the way you see it
[44:16] that he's all of God that in him dwelt
[44:20] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[44:26] see that's what I see Jesus is being oh
[44:30] mighty God that's the only name God ever
[44:33] had
[44:34] CJ v8 sphere j vh u is not a name
[44:37] Jehovah it's not a name Jesus is his
[44:44] night well you take Jesus and run it all
[44:49] the way back you can't take your hope
[44:51] and run it all the way back cuz you're
[44:53] gonna run out cuz you're gonna come up
[44:55] to somebody like nice gonna throw
[44:57] Scripture out the Jesus that Jehovah
[44:59] said back there as you call him you know
[45:01] oh he was your over he said by my name
[45:03] Jehovah what I never known so that told
[45:07] you over witnessed some time we were
[45:08] talking to when they're talking about
[45:10] the name of God is Jehovah give them the
[45:12] scripture this is my name drop by my
[45:15] name's your eyes never known there was
[45:19] no way to pronounce that is j vh v j vh
[45:23] u now that's the to putting them
[45:26] together and i'm saying it the way
[45:28] brother Branham says it so you say well
[45:31] it's j vh v is j vh you you won't find j
[45:35] vh v separating from j vh you he's
[45:38] expressing it and see there's no vowels
[45:43] now you got a AEIOU you got a you in it
[45:46] but there's not enough vowels to
[45:49] pronounce the name in the Old Testament
[45:51] even your scholars will tell you that
[45:54] that there's not there was no vowels to
[45:57] pronounce it was j vh v r j vh you
[46:01] really brought around and put some boat
[46:03] together to at the same point he doesn't
[46:06] define it he puts them together j vh v j
[46:09] vh you in the same message alright
[46:12] see because you can't pronounce it
[46:17] then they have that G to a certain way
[46:21] Oh
[46:21] D that did you draw it out and write it
[46:24] out as is saying that that is God but
[46:27] they have no way of pronouncing it and
[46:29] they say before they'll ever write that
[46:30] it's so holy and reverence to them
[46:33] because it represents Almighty God
[46:35] they'll stop lay the pen down and go
[46:37] take a bath come back and then they'll
[46:38] write that night
[46:39] there's no reverence that much but you
[46:44] see then what is it
[46:45] see without brother branham explaining
[46:47] now listen he's explaining Christ the
[46:52] mystery of God revealed that in the
[46:54] Millennium God will be sitting on his
[46:58] throne Jesus the human flesh will what
[47:01] leave what you see but God will be in
[47:04] that flesh because that's who he is God
[47:09] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[47:10] himself all right that's Christ the
[47:15] mystery then he receives the revelation
[47:18] he goes into the future home at a later
[47:21] date and he brains the same scripture
[47:25] that God may be all in all for the
[47:30] future home didn't he knows and sees
[47:35] Christ the mystery he sees the Millenium
[47:39] who do you think you're gonna see end of
[47:42] millennium sitting on the throne are you
[47:44] gonna see three Thrones one for the
[47:45] father one for the son one for them no
[47:47] we don't believe in the Trinity there'll
[47:50] be one throne but who will be on the
[47:52] throne Jesus but you realize who he is
[47:58] by then see we're getting who is here
[48:02] and I am we're supposed to be realizing
[48:04] who he is here that's what's gonna get
[48:06] us dark he's realizing who he is that he
[48:11] is the all and in all
[48:14] he's in ever born-again believer today
[48:17] that has eternal life but that ain't all
[48:25] of his redemptive plan the other other
[48:27] places the Jew
[48:29] the the foolish virgins the different
[48:32] ones it has to be added there'll be
[48:35] things in the Millennium then that are
[48:39] not in the future huh you won't fully
[48:42] bring forth the complete revelation in
[48:44] the Millennium but it's a revelation
[48:46] enough to know who that the Jews will
[48:48] see him sitting on that throne hey
[48:50] listen we're supposed to be seeing him
[48:52] now we've got to wait to the millennium
[48:55] to see Jesus sitting on the on David's
[48:57] throne and realize what's taking place
[48:59] that's to the Jews that's their time the
[49:04] millennium is to the Jews where they're
[49:06] on a honeymoon
[49:12] those Jews will see him as all in all
[49:15] but they'll see that he's already in
[49:18] this group they'll see that he's all in
[49:21] all in his wife then they'll see what
[49:27] happens to them cuz you 144,000 when we
[49:31] leave out of here
[49:32] they get eternal life they're gonna
[49:33] realize right there who they are right
[49:39] here they're going to realize who they
[49:41] are and they'll have to give their life
[49:43] you under 44,000 give their life for the
[49:47] gospel all right they're all killed two
[49:51] witnesses are killed all right seed in
[49:54] the Millennium it would be to the Jews
[49:57] they will be the one that will be trying
[49:59] to understand who he is
[50:01] it ain't gonna be me and you you and me
[50:03] is gonna be able to explain who he is
[50:05] that's what I've told you about it
[50:07] that's why the Bible covers it what is
[50:10] it is even though it's not as they can
[50:13] win it where there be a millennium
[50:16] Temple is equal 40 to 44 will be the
[50:21] Millennium temple built no bill
[50:24] millennium temple there will be no
[50:27] sacrifices they won't be no doing like
[50:29] that no it's there for an explanation
[50:32] all right but in the future home
[50:39] there won't be no temple because the
[50:44] lamb is the temple I'm quoting you
[50:46] scriptures
[50:47] I'm gonna lay in here in front of me
[50:50] revelations read it 21:22 in it there'll
[50:54] be no temple
[50:58] there'll be no light because the lamb
[51:05] and God is the light now is that two
[51:09] people remember God can't be same so in
[51:14] the future home you ain't gonna be
[51:16] saying well I'll see God in the future
[51:17] huh no you'll see the body of Jesus and
[51:21] know who that is
[51:24] you really see who is in but he said
[51:28] when you see me you've seen the father
[51:30] we can't understand that now but
[51:35] remember the father was in that flesh
[51:38] walking upon the earth so in the
[51:44] Millennium he will sit on the throne of
[51:47] David who Jesus the human element flesh
[51:51] man Jesus the body which is made eternal
[51:54] and who be living in that the father he
[52:03] said he didn't overcome and sit with me
[52:04] in my throne as I've overcome and sit
[52:06] with my father in his throne he overcame
[52:08] unto death on the crucifixion and come
[52:11] to the Father's throne
[52:12] baptism of the Holy go now in the
[52:14] Millenium the father comes to the throne
[52:19] of David through the Son of Man which is
[52:23] the Lord Jesus Christ this all the
[52:28] correct story are the acts of a play
[52:31] that is unfolding down through there
[52:35] that God may be all you know see that
[52:44] it's not looking like in the Millennium
[52:46] well there's only two of them here
[52:47] but in the future home all three of them
[52:49] gets together
[52:52] is that now who is your God what are you
[52:59] expecting to see in the Millenium the
[53:06] same one that'll be in the future home
[53:09] the Lord Jesus Christ he said Philip
[53:16] have I been so long we Philips its
[53:19] shorts the father he said have I been so
[53:22] long with you have you've seen me you've
[53:24] seen the father
[53:30] very still it see we want to make Jesus
[53:36] that's the problem with the people of
[53:37] the nation they want to make Jesus a
[53:39] body spirit and soul man and then try to
[53:44] some way on the River Jordan bring this
[53:46] in and bring this in and let him become
[53:49] God and the more it keeps coming in till
[53:51] finally all three have winds up back
[53:53] together well I don't believe that
[53:56] whatever you believe you do what you
[53:58] want to but I don't teach nothing like
[54:00] that I believe when that baby was born
[54:06] the Bible's right a body thou has
[54:11] prepared me but one said it was the
[54:16] father provided the body then he turns
[54:18] around said it was those Old Testament
[54:20] prophets that built the body that was
[54:25] what God was doing to provide but when
[54:27] that spirit and that soul stepped into
[54:29] that body it wasn't a spirit my soul
[54:32] just of a man it was a very soul of
[54:36] Almighty God it was a very spirit of
[54:39] Almighty God his spirit his soul was
[54:45] eternal he said yeah but wait a minute
[54:47] he's tempted you got to eternal life you
[54:50] ever have any problems are you ever
[54:54] tempted ain't gonna asked how many times
[55:00] we yield asked many times were tempted
[55:05] what are you following me see that God
[55:09] may be all you know that comes in stage
[55:16] you see he's an ever born-again believer
[55:19] right here today around the world he's
[55:24] all in all he's in all born-again
[55:27] believers but there's more about him to
[55:32] be made manifest so when we get out of
[55:35] here
[55:35] you get 144,000 Jews that will get
[55:40] eternal life to them he'll be all in all
[55:43] and they'll look and see that that bride
[55:47] was that very all and all that he
[55:50] cherished you didn't come back to get
[55:53] them now come on he come back to get his
[55:57] bride the Jews wound up as part of it
[56:02] because they were part in the beginning
[56:04] all right are you seeing what I'm
[56:07] talking about it's unfolding the all and
[56:09] all is the bride then when he steps into
[56:13] another manifestation with the Jews
[56:15] there they are they all in all when he
[56:19] comes to the white throne he will give
[56:21] eternal life to the foolish virgins in
[56:23] different groups then he's all in all
[56:28] all in all just keeps getting greater
[56:30] and greater and greater when it comes to
[56:34] the white throne he's given to the
[56:36] foolish virgin all in all and then
[56:40] everybody that has eternal life will be
[56:45] the all and in all
[56:52] when we're gonna get down to believe in
[56:54] the Prophet how many times you ever
[57:00] heard him say all that God was he poured
[57:02] into Christ all that Christ he pours
[57:05] into the church take her back to the
[57:07] Garden of Eden how many times you heard
[57:09] him say that
[57:14] know what you think he's talking about
[57:23] when he says God is not complete without
[57:26] us do you how many quotes do you want
[57:29] that we are a part of God right now him
[57:37] any quotes do you own of the Prophet
[57:38] where he said we're a part of God well
[57:40] you know that many simple language then
[57:43] there's the whole fullness if you take
[57:46] out one little piece he's not complete
[57:49] right if there's anybody in the world
[58:00] today that hasn't received he turn align
[58:02] but does receive eternal life you
[58:04] realize he ain't complete until then
[58:06] eternal life comes into that person
[58:09] right is that sensible see it's the
[58:20] expanding of God revealing himself in a
[58:24] greater way and you realize they'll make
[58:28] this statement quit on it as a series
[58:30] anybody else got any questions so if
[58:31] you've got anything raise your hand
[58:33] we'll go you realize it's you and I now
[58:39] the greatest opportunity that has ever
[58:44] existed in this world for us to have the
[58:51] very interpreter in our soul to
[59:00] interpret God's Word all of the compound
[59:04] names of Jehovah applying to Jesus
[59:07] Christ and we're his wife
[59:18] where his wife where his children how
[59:23] can you explain that you realized the
[59:25] Bible says he's my brother he's my
[59:27] Savior
[59:28] he's my Redeemer he's my healer he's my
[59:31] father he's my son he's my holy goat
[59:33] he's all of those titles and how can you
[59:37] explain it and one thing if you're a
[59:48] born-again Christian today you have part
[59:51] of God's life in you and until that
[59:55] happened to you God is not complete cuz
[1:00:01] we're apart you get all the parts
[1:00:04] together
[1:00:09] no come on are you listening and just
[1:00:11] because ever born again believer the
[1:00:14] Bride of Christ
[1:00:14] even though she receives eternal life
[1:00:16] there are some parts of God that are not
[1:00:18] made manifest he's got to go to the Jews
[1:00:23] and get them he's got to go to the White
[1:00:25] Throne and get them there are some parts
[1:00:28] I can't say it no other way that's not
[1:00:33] been made manifest we're talking about
[1:00:39] all the plan of redemption is over that
[1:00:41] was one of the first doctrines that hit
[1:00:43] me in the message they told me I
[1:00:45] couldn't be saved after 63 because
[1:00:46] Redemption was over I'm sorry that I'm
[1:00:51] hard-headed and everything else and just
[1:00:54] kind of like to read a little I told him
[1:00:57] I said well according to my Bible
[1:00:59] redemption was over before the world
[1:01:01] ever begun till then he known he all
[1:01:07] saved because you're saying it was after
[1:01:12] 63 you know you couldn't get saved
[1:01:14] mm-hmm it was before the world he died
[1:01:19] as a lamb before the world you see
[1:01:24] for sure of one thing you know for sure
[1:01:30] of one time the person who'd tell you
[1:01:34] you couldn't be saved laughter 63 they
[1:01:37] made sure they got saved before 63 right
[1:01:42] because it wouldn't go get up and say
[1:01:44] you couldn't be saved after 63 and and
[1:01:47] I'm in the same shape because I can't be
[1:01:48] saved either cuz I ain't saved yet you
[1:01:51] see how silly we are when we've got the
[1:01:55] greatest opportunity of comprehending
[1:01:58] God's Word to be able to go all the way
[1:02:02] back to Genesis and come straight down
[1:02:05] through the Bible and come out to the
[1:02:07] end of the full plan of redemption to be
[1:02:10] delivered to us to take us straight to
[1:02:12] the future home you remember what I told
[1:02:16] that man at my home that day when he was
[1:02:18] telling you know I see I know what
[1:02:19] you're doing you're thinking you gonna
[1:02:21] go beyond brother Branham you gonna tell
[1:02:23] us something brought around him didn't
[1:02:24] tell us I said go ahead and tell me but
[1:02:27] I said start after the future home cuz
[1:02:29] he got me that far
[1:02:32] well he just shut up
[1:02:34] God where are you going I said tell me
[1:02:37] something life in the future home I said
[1:02:40] probably preach this to the future all
[1:02:44] well he didn't like it I was a smart
[1:02:47] aleck sorry I agree to be an Alec ain't
[1:02:51] too smart but do you understand what
[1:02:55] it's simply anybody got a question not a
[1:02:57] relation do you need a brother Ryan Oh
[1:03:00] somebody better get the microphone wait
[1:03:04] let me get a microphone worth
[1:03:18] okay go ahead brother you probably
[1:03:23] already answered this and maybe I missed
[1:03:24] it but in the Millennium will Jesus be
[1:03:29] sitting on the throne in a corporal body
[1:03:32] you know and that'll be in the temple or
[1:03:36] what would that be it could be in the
[1:03:37] temple cause temple will be there right
[1:03:39] it's just not a temple made for
[1:03:41] sacrificial or anything else it's a
[1:03:44] temple that was all thank you he'll be
[1:03:46] there in a physical body you know what
[1:03:48] benefit let's go I ain't gonna say
[1:03:50] physical that's an eternal body but it
[1:03:52] he'll be an eternal body that's physical
[1:03:54] all right God we're gonna be there in
[1:03:56] eternal bodies that's physical come
[1:03:59] we're gonna have a body like he is right
[1:04:01] and we're going to be there with him in
[1:04:04] physical bodies the bodies that are made
[1:04:07] eternal now to the rest of this art
[1:04:10] they're not gonna be eternal because
[1:04:15] he'll be sitting on the throne and they
[1:04:18] be designated son of David if you want
[1:04:20] to put it that way but just remember my
[1:04:22] point would all the way through if he's
[1:04:24] sitting on that throne there is Almighty
[1:04:29] God
[1:04:30] there's father son Holy Ghost Alpha and
[1:04:33] Omega the beginning in the rows are
[1:04:35] sharing the lily of the valley the all
[1:04:37] of the father son holy go all of it
[1:04:40] sitting right there in that body and
[1:04:46] we'll be around him and he'll be all and
[1:04:49] all anybody else sister Judy
[1:05:05] the bride is the only one that has a new
[1:05:09] birth right of all the people that have
[1:05:11] eternal life
[1:05:12] yeah the bride is the only one because
[1:05:15] when you said an importation is not a
[1:05:19] birth right so everybody else has given
[1:05:21] an impartation right of eternal life
[1:05:24] right okay that was only the bride has
[1:05:28] the new birth because see she's gonna be
[1:05:30] part of him right that's why the new
[1:05:33] birth is the one I believe it like I do
[1:05:35] what is the new bird brother Dale
[1:05:37] brother branham what is the new birth
[1:05:39] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] personally to you the word in other
[1:05:47] words revealed to you is that new birth
[1:05:51] well what could be revealed to a foolish
[1:05:53] virgin that he's a foolish virgin but he
[1:05:58] can be given eternal life because of it
[1:06:00] is the things that he done anybody else
[1:06:03] somebody else's brother
[1:06:13] mother John first nimbler the border one
[1:06:15] of the two coating so yes brother I know
[1:06:18] in the I think it's the the breech
[1:06:21] brother Burnham is saying that Jesus
[1:06:22] Christ is leaving the Father's throne to
[1:06:25] take his own throne right so just wonder
[1:06:28] if you can explain that a little bit
[1:06:30] okay and getting into your in
[1:06:33] revelations four and five okay
[1:06:35] that's where waves in that part I'll
[1:06:37] just make an emphasis over the little
[1:06:39] the end revelations chapter for you go
[1:06:43] to heaven you see the throne there's
[1:06:46] nobody on it it doesn't list somebody on
[1:06:50] it it sees the throne first and then you
[1:06:53] see somebody on it see it's separating
[1:06:55] it the throne is there alright that
[1:06:59] throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:01] down through the seven church ages
[1:07:03] that's the throne of God alright now
[1:07:06] here there's something close to that in
[1:07:08] that now this perforated brother Brennan
[1:07:11] said see the lamb he said he comes forth
[1:07:15] in City comes around from behind said
[1:07:19] he's been back here making redemption
[1:07:21] through the church ages he said he comes
[1:07:23] forth may now I may have this backwards
[1:07:27] but he comes for takes the book out of
[1:07:29] the one sitting up on the throne climbs
[1:07:31] up on the throne and sits down and said
[1:07:33] I'm the one that did it
[1:07:35] what does that mean that means God is in
[1:07:38] morphing and you're seeing him they
[1:07:43] could spend hours okay because where
[1:07:47] does the lamb come from the lamb comes
[1:07:50] from the church age is the you climb
[1:07:54] upon the throne he does and sits down
[1:07:56] and then sees he can open the book
[1:07:59] because he becomes one with the one
[1:08:03] sitting on the throne not it takes two
[1:08:05] different people
[1:08:06] he just keeps evolving or in morphing
[1:08:08] changing his form until here comes all
[1:08:12] of God finally interview and he sits
[1:08:14] down on the throne that's in Chapter
[1:08:17] five you gets upon the throne sits down
[1:08:20] and says I'm the one who done it
[1:08:23] not now I'm brother branham said it this
[1:08:26] wait I'm gonna make the statement called
[1:08:27] wave coming actually that one of these
[1:08:28] day though
[1:08:30] chapter five is the opening of the seals
[1:08:32] we go to six and try to read this and
[1:08:35] read and read brother branham said
[1:08:38] chapter five is the opening of the seals
[1:08:42] that don't even sound sensible to our
[1:08:45] human minds because it's the fifth sixth
[1:08:48] chapter he's starting to see the opening
[1:08:50] of the seals is not to the bride is to
[1:08:56] Jews alright that enough for the board
[1:09:02] okay so we got anybody else
[1:09:13] you see to me the more you see the word
[1:09:17] the more of God you're seeing ok sister
[1:09:23] Anna it's just a quick question now the
[1:09:27] sequence will be the the the dead in
[1:09:30] Christ will rise first and then we'll be
[1:09:33] here for a few days like 30 days then we
[1:09:35] take their rapture okay my mind went to
[1:09:39] I know some believers will be left
[1:09:42] behind those who don't have the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost and they know the word and they'll
[1:09:47] know that maybe the bribes gone up
[1:09:51] somehow probably they'll know now the
[1:09:53] foolish virgins are the ones who will
[1:09:56] die
[1:09:57] when they give their life for the gospel
[1:10:00] right I was just my mind just went
[1:10:03] wandering one and I kept wondering okay
[1:10:06] if some believers would know that
[1:10:09] something has happened
[1:10:10] well okay and they know probably I'm
[1:10:12] a-gettin he's about to come on mm-hmm
[1:10:14] nuclear war well if somebody decides to
[1:10:17] take a gun and shoot themselves and
[1:10:19] they're really okay they know the word
[1:10:21] is that will they be foolish friend you
[1:10:25] know will they be lost just wondered
[1:10:27] about that little Eve totally left up
[1:10:29] there to guard himself as to what those
[1:10:33] people would be because I can say it
[1:10:35] this way that's where we would always
[1:10:38] taught if you killed yourself he was
[1:10:39] gonna die and go to hell
[1:10:40] we'll see the Prophet straighten that
[1:10:42] out that's not that he said it doesn't
[1:10:44] matter said you could take a gun and
[1:10:45] blow your head off
[1:10:46] he said that has nothing to do with your
[1:10:47] salvation see we was told he did was
[1:10:50] taught that we've lost see because of
[1:10:53] that because that was the Catholic
[1:10:54] trying to scare you
[1:10:55] let's see the foolish virgins in other
[1:10:59] words we go out of here or are the
[1:11:01] resurrection comes now I'm quoting
[1:11:04] brother Branham we'll get to quote some
[1:11:07] of the people as you said they are not
[1:11:09] into bride so they don't get it they
[1:11:11] don't see what's taking place but now
[1:11:14] here's the one statement I see but a run
[1:11:16] said a little voice will say you missed
[1:11:21] it
[1:11:23] we'll see everybody will look at our
[1:11:25] I've heard people say said look at
[1:11:26] either the head the Holy Ghost cause
[1:11:28] who's the little voice telling them the
[1:11:30] little voice telling them as a soul
[1:11:31] that's when a man that sees that he's
[1:11:35] done lost it and he don't have no hopes
[1:11:38] to go in the bride so then he'll have to
[1:11:43] give his life for the gospel and he
[1:11:47] could be given eternal life but remember
[1:11:49] if you turn this message down there is
[1:11:54] no hopes at the white throne now if you
[1:11:58] turn it down you're gonna face him as an
[1:11:59] unbeliever so don't put the foolish
[1:12:03] virgin just in a lump you know something
[1:12:05] remember he said there'll be a little
[1:12:09] voice say you missed it that's not the
[1:12:13] Holy Ghost telling you you missed it
[1:12:15] because the Holy Ghost going in rapture
[1:12:18] it's just a voice in your inner being
[1:12:20] which is your soul I'll let you realize
[1:12:23] hey I've missed this and what can I do
[1:12:28] what can you do but give your life for
[1:12:30] the gospel I sure don't stand in that
[1:12:38] place I'm gonna say this planing blunt
[1:12:41] to you you here in Lula you can think
[1:12:44] what you won't do what I've told what
[1:12:45] I've been all the years and what's been
[1:12:47] talked to you all this year don't you
[1:12:49] ever think you can qualify for a foolish
[1:12:50] virgin don't get that in your mind if I
[1:12:54] don't make it your rapture all this go
[1:12:56] as a foolish virgin you better be
[1:12:58] careful now some of the churches across
[1:13:02] the country I'm just plain for what
[1:13:05] they've taught and everything that
[1:13:06] people might be foolish virgins sitting
[1:13:08] there and get eternal life when the
[1:13:12] pastor will even lose and I didn't get
[1:13:14] it itself but you have no excuse you
[1:13:18] think that as being an exalted statement
[1:13:20] do what you want to cause for
[1:13:23] 40-something years I've been teaching
[1:13:26] these things and you come show me where
[1:13:28] I changed and show me where I change my
[1:13:31] doctor
[1:13:35] if I see I'm wrong I'll be glad to tell
[1:13:37] you I'm wrong I don't have to worry
[1:13:40] about it I preached for years that
[1:13:45] beyond the curtain of time they didn't
[1:13:46] have the census but one day I found a
[1:13:52] prophet said they did
[1:13:53] I came right here and told you I was
[1:13:55] wrong the Prophet said then beyond the
[1:13:59] curtain of time had CTAs field I mean
[1:14:01] had memory reason cause they were
[1:14:04] remember what took place I don't mind
[1:14:08] telling you I'm wrong so if you think
[1:14:11] I'm wrong come tell me anybody else
[1:14:16] whose sister Barbara
[1:14:27] I was just curious no the 144,000 are
[1:14:30] going to become servants to the bride
[1:14:33] the five or six million shoes that died
[1:14:36] in the Holocaust oh they also be
[1:14:38] servants to the bride well see your your
[1:14:44] talk about a fifth feel Jew and that's
[1:14:46] not servants to the bride you got a desk
[1:14:48] designate there can only be 144,000 and
[1:14:51] servants to the bride you know because
[1:14:54] they get now that's the the here's the
[1:14:56] catch here is that one two three still
[1:14:58] me we get eternal out here and we leave
[1:15:02] out the foolish of the 144,000 get
[1:15:06] eternal life then they give their life
[1:15:09] the foolish virgins and other Jews and
[1:15:12] if I get eternal life at the white
[1:15:14] throne in time so they need that
[1:15:17] different stages see they won't be food
[1:15:19] servants to the bride they'll just be
[1:15:21] that khalsa promise okay because they
[1:15:23] get robes of righteousness that's what I
[1:15:25] was wondering
[1:15:26] come on now they get the white robes
[1:15:30] they're given white robes well that
[1:15:35] would be it's a white throne but uh I'm
[1:15:38] technical or I've told it and I believe
[1:15:43] it the fields you don't go to the white
[1:15:46] throne now if you find what brother Owen
[1:15:48] said he did all right that's it let's
[1:15:50] hear it but I want to hear it from him
[1:15:53] because that feels fields you according
[1:15:56] to the Bible is given white robes and
[1:15:59] told to wait now listen that's why not
[1:16:04] what throne they're told to wait until
[1:16:08] their fellow brethren which is the
[1:16:10] 144,000 are killed so that feels sealed
[1:16:14] you has to be somewhere between us
[1:16:16] stepping out of here and God going to
[1:16:19] the Jews for the hundred forty-four
[1:16:20] thousand that feel sealed you cuts off
[1:16:23] somewhere right there there will be no
[1:16:26] more of them they'll be given white
[1:16:28] robes well if they're given what it rose
[1:16:30] why are you going to the Lots wrong
[1:16:32] you said well they're going to a white
[1:16:33] throne to get robe now that your way
[1:16:34] back over here you're not getting it
[1:16:36] you're not listening
[1:16:38] point the point is we leave out of here
[1:16:41] there's somewhere running are there
[1:16:43] going to be a cutoff for that Jew of the
[1:16:47] fifth seal Jews because the next will be
[1:16:49] the redemption to 144,000 now they will
[1:16:53] be Jews because they'll be just like
[1:16:56] foolish virgins they'll beads use it to
[1:16:57] white throne because they can qualify
[1:17:01] for foolish virgins right and be given
[1:17:06] eternal life at that time
[1:17:07] but that's specific that's why old man
[1:17:10] church you talk about something when
[1:17:12] that prophet when I read that and that
[1:17:14] feel seal all that opened up a lot of
[1:17:18] things to me that I'd always wondered
[1:17:21] about it sound like some group of people
[1:17:25] with our but we couldn't understand what
[1:17:28] to do with it you realize God blinded
[1:17:33] their eyes that we might be saved he
[1:17:41] blinded them that we might be saved
[1:17:44] oh what a wonderful everything else
[1:17:49] anything that's it anybody else before
[1:17:53] we go come on musicians think on these
[1:18:02] things like I said now keep these notes
[1:18:04] that you got because when you look at
[1:18:06] you get your notes you're gonna see
[1:18:08] automatically that we're going to a
[1:18:11] position because you're gonna sit here
[1:18:18] then if God's not complete without of us
[1:18:20] you realize in that city it's gonna be
[1:18:25] carnal statement but listen you realize
[1:18:28] in that city now in the city not in the
[1:18:31] world or anything in the city if you are
[1:18:37] supposed to be that light and they're
[1:18:39] not there there'll be a dark spot as
[1:18:43] plain language they'll see you're the
[1:18:46] light of the world
[1:18:51] now know neither the like if you ain't
[1:18:55] there
[1:18:55] the city won't be lit those you're part
[1:19:00] of going I wish would get that I wish we
[1:19:05] could just realize and I'm talking about
[1:19:07] me I realize hey we're a part of God not
[1:19:10] this here that eternal life that dwells
[1:19:14] within you is a part of God cause it's
[1:19:19] his own life go ahead brother what we
