[10:09] persecute you what that ye may be the
[10:13] children of your father in other words
[10:15] you may have the nature of your father
[10:16] because that was what he had right that
[10:21] you may be the children of your father
[10:22] which is in heaven or he maketh his son
[10:25] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[10:27] sendeth rain on the just and on the
[10:29] unjust or if you love them which love
[10:32] you what reward have you do not even the
[10:34] publicans the same and if you salute
[10:37] your brethren only what do you more than
[10:39] others do not even the publicans so many
[10:43] summed it up by saying one know where
[10:45] this is the way to be like the father
[10:46] right be therefore perfect even as your
[10:49] father which is in heaven is perfect
[10:51] alright let's go over to the first Peter
[10:54] down to stick of it a scripture first
[10:58] first Peter I might've said second Peter
[11:00] by the first Peter first Peter one
[11:04] when we get reading the verse 7 that the
[11:09] trial of your faith being much more
[11:11] precious than gold that khurshid do it
[11:14] be tried with fire might be found into
[11:16] the praise and honor and glory or at the
[11:19] appearing of Jesus Christ whom having
[11:22] not seen you love in whom though now you
[11:24] see him not yet being believing you
[11:28] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[11:31] glory receiving the end of your faith
[11:33] even the salvation of your soul of which
[11:36] salvation the prophets have desired and
[11:38] searched diligently who profits out of
[11:40] the grace that should comin to you
[11:42] searching water what manner of time the
[11:45] Spirit of Christ which was in them did
[11:47] signify when it testified before hand
[11:50] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[11:53] that should follow unto whom it was
[11:55] revealed now once these revealed them
[11:57] that it wouldn't happen in their day
[11:58] speaking of us coming down right unto
[12:01] whom it was revealed that not unto
[12:03] themselves but unto us they'd administer
[12:06] the things which are now reported unto
[12:08] you by them that have preached the
[12:10] gospel and to you by the Holy Ghost sent
[12:13] down from heaven which sings the angel
[12:15] is desired to looking into we're for now
[12:18] watching gird up the loins of your mind
[12:20] of the sober and hope to the end for the
[12:23] grace that is to be brought to you unto
[12:26] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[12:29] and they succeeded the Lord at his
[12:31] blessing to the reading of the word
[12:33] nobody get it too hot lately may have to
[12:37] click a little about her where we can
[12:39] survive right but now as I said I've
[12:46] been trying for a while to speak about
[12:50] something that I'm leaving it's been
[12:53] needful to each and every one of us in
[12:55] it and trying to bring it now its
[12:57] message 18 and I know I'm pretty slow
[13:00] but that's the way things go you just
[13:01] keep on going and do it too to
[13:04] understand the the word and I you know
[13:09] you can't you can't exhaust the word so
[13:13] you just keep believing it enough we've
[13:15] been talking about the topic of what be
[13:17] there for perfect now and a human morals
[13:22] realm life me and you you know us there
[13:27] is no way for any human mortal to be
[13:31] perfect he calls that the way we're born
[13:35] is the psalmist David said we were born
[13:37] in sin shape with an iniquity equipped
[13:39] with three scriptures together and we
[13:41] were spouse from our mothers wound and
[13:43] go forth a liar you you you don't want
[13:46] to say it about them but you look down
[13:47] in a little baby you know and you see it
[13:49] and you say well that value is a product
[13:51] of mother and Daddy through the wedding
[13:54] bed you know you know coming forth but
[13:57] still it's born in this realm out here
[14:00] we're all born in a realm which belongs
[14:03] to the devil like one that even the Lord
[14:06] Jesus or remembering the temptation
[14:08] there that Satan offered him this and he
[14:11] offered him that offered him he said all
[14:13] the kingdoms of the world well jesus
[14:16] never argued with him did it hide he
[14:20] just said get behind you say no cuz it
[14:23] even out of argument with him about it
[14:24] because Satan does own all of this all
[14:28] of this out here in the
[14:29] world belongs to Satan in his domain and
[14:32] that's why the trouble is so horrible
[14:34] among the other thing around the world
[14:36] today is it Satan knows he had just a
[14:39] little season the Bible said so he's
[14:41] doing everything he can to tighten it
[14:43] down and everything else and you know
[14:47] and destroy mankind because that's his
[14:49] purpose but see the lord jesus said be
[14:53] therefore perfect even as your father in
[14:55] heaven is perfect well now that's the
[14:58] requirement he didn't say maybe you will
[15:01] my hope he will think about it you know
[15:04] whatever he just made a statement be
[15:08] therefore perfect even as your father in
[15:10] heaven is perfect well then if he made
[15:12] that statement our requirement that he
[15:15] must be able in some way to produce that
[15:19] whatever would take to be able to make a
[15:23] person perfect and we as human mortal we
[15:26] can't be because we're bored ears our
[15:29] mind or are thinking this is a whole
[15:32] messed up because of all of the things
[15:34] that happened in life and it always say
[15:37] to you about a little baby you know we
[15:40] love them and they're so sweet but yet
[15:41] they little baby when it opens his eyes
[15:43] in the nursery Verena in the hospital
[15:46] the first thing it here's the first
[15:48] thing it sees it right and then it
[15:51] here's a couple of nurses and they said
[15:53] well if that blankety-blank little baby
[15:55] come in here messed up her to all our
[15:57] whole day you know and we were going to
[15:59] have some funds another in the poor
[16:01] little baby he starts out wrong right
[16:03] you know you said well I don't an open
[16:05] well here you go back to very different
[16:06] lives it does you know and then they're
[16:09] always said my head yours a full moon
[16:10] you know we're gonna have a bunch of
[16:11] babies tonight so what you know but it's
[16:15] it's the fact in a way that we're born
[16:17] and perverted all right then it's surely
[16:20] a fact if we know that we need salvation
[16:23] that's right we know that without even
[16:26] having anybody to talk to us about it we
[16:28] realize that we need salvation
[16:31] and no matter where you would go in the
[16:32] world you would find people that have
[16:35] never even heard of Jesus Christ or
[16:37] something like that and you'd find them
[16:39] worshipping something right you know
[16:42] totem pole miles animals whatever you
[16:45] know and as they're doing they're
[16:48] showing what it is in man panco we were
[16:50] made for that price we were late for the
[16:53] point to where that we need a Savior all
[16:55] right so then the only way that mankind
[16:58] could ever come to a thought of thinking
[17:00] about being perfect it wouldn't have to
[17:03] mean that God would have to make away
[17:05] his self and that sits within it that he
[17:09] would have to make away right all right
[17:11] you said well there's none of it perfect
[17:12] i greatly we're predicts exactly right
[17:15] we're not perfect all right then you get
[17:18] the points a lot of people say I'm not
[17:19] perfect I just forgive it what i don't
[17:22] realize if you're forgiven if God
[17:25] forgives you then that wipes the slate
[17:27] clean bad he doesn't remember what you
[17:31] asked him to forgive me write you about
[17:34] it's gone and the Bible caught it in the
[17:37] sea of this forgetfulness and you know
[17:39] you can can go out there and then you
[17:41] can't find the bottom of the ocean know
[17:43] where they go down as moment and they
[17:45] still just keep going but you know I'm
[17:47] sure they can technically now find
[17:49] things but this the point of it is our
[17:52] sins are in see if we're giving us and
[17:53] God all right now if they're gone you
[17:57] know now i know we we grandmother's and
[18:00] granddad's to talk different than your
[18:02] other people now you know our kids
[18:04] always said my kids hello with a little
[18:07] horny you know because Richard kids are
[18:10] gently the meanest ones you you know and
[18:13] deacons phone right behind that but yes
[18:15] and they pointed each other you don't
[18:17] say much the other one but there comes a
[18:21] grand babies you know and they come
[18:23] along and you know what we saw
[18:27] everything in the world our kids done
[18:29] and then when the grandkids came I mean
[18:34] our kids to tell you don't get on the
[18:37] bed
[18:38] you get a woman we're getting on the bed
[18:40] we're here comes the grandkids you right
[18:43] up in the middle of the bed this Max's
[18:44] morning mean because it kind of gets
[18:47] we're using you your you don't see as
[18:49] much I'm trying to show you how God is
[18:52] you know right now the great grandkids
[18:54] come along it just gets the worse and
[18:56] worse and worketh anyway no they just
[18:58] don't do anything wrong I mean they
[19:01] didn't matter what they just don't do
[19:03] anything wrong we'll see take that is an
[19:06] example of what God would be with his
[19:09] children that he looks down to you and I
[19:12] and he sees us not as sinners cuz he's
[19:16] looking through the bud abbott all right
[19:19] now that's what i've tried to express
[19:21] see if that blood of the bulls and goats
[19:23] in the Old Testament when they would
[19:25] offer the lamb you know and the gun at
[19:27] each year for further they hold you know
[19:33] group of Israelites and that covering
[19:37] would cover them for a year ma you know
[19:40] that God couldn't see them as I tried to
[19:43] explain to you were bailiff company in
[19:44] that time you know and he tried to show
[19:46] God the bad parts of Israel he looked at
[19:50] her and CEO nice called a hundred parts
[19:52] you know look down and see look what
[19:54] they're doing God says I don't see him
[19:57] Haven one was it he couldn't see him now
[20:03] being the omnipotent omniscient annoying
[20:05] and everything we know that he knows
[20:08] about it but yet see he had made a
[20:10] sacrament with his real man that if they
[20:15] would make the sacrifice they would
[20:18] cover their scene right he abides by his
[20:22] word yep that's where I love about the
[20:25] word of god I love to read the Word of
[20:26] God card i love to regency it promises
[20:28] man no i don't i said really and it said
[20:32] one day said you'll be there with your
[20:33] offspring we know what I believe that
[20:35] okay well but I let they gotta be safe
[20:38] too but I believe they're coming to that
[20:40] point you know the worthy will but I
[20:42] just believe what I say
[20:43] alright so we've looking at it is
[20:45] ruining season but yet he's covered
[20:48] they're covered by a covering of the
[20:51] blood of an animal it would offer but
[20:54] you know that animal could not saving
[20:57] buddy it could only cover their sin all
[21:00] right year later they had to make
[21:02] another atonement leave a year later
[21:05] they had to make another atonement it
[21:07] had to be done on the yearly basis all
[21:10] right but then one day the all of that
[21:14] came to an end event with that God
[21:17] Himself came down to pay the price
[21:22] because the animal has no soul they
[21:26] could not come back upon the belief and
[21:28] it's just an animal it has a life it has
[21:30] a spirit about it it can be trained to
[21:32] do things they can even teach them to
[21:34] call and things but they can't make
[21:37] decisions like the mortal human being
[21:40] because that when dealing with their
[21:42] soul of that person so the animal has a
[21:45] life he has a spirit about it you can
[21:48] give me talk but yet he still feels his
[21:51] bird that's the same way you know we got
[21:54] a couple o rabbits we have to deal with
[21:55] all the timing you know they're smart
[21:58] enough to figure out how to get out of
[21:59] the pen but you know I've rewired
[22:03] everything I'm thinking about putting an
[22:04] electrical shock all the way around the
[22:06] whole thing yes now then booters are
[22:10] smaller cubes the mother day of nine one
[22:15] of these we call it dog chain fence
[22:18] things you know and the boogers went
[22:20] right in the corner and over that money
[22:21] up you got out that's not well they
[22:24] pretty smart now really looked around to
[22:27] see if I can find anywhere pliers if
[22:29] they took the paint looks with you
[22:31] because linea I'm you going to get to
[22:34] wireless when you can't make me with
[22:35] your hand you go in a try no but you
[22:38] know but anyhow but they still can't
[22:41] reason it out right because of
[22:42] acceptable let's stay in that be I know
[22:45] what goes to of the neighbors has got
[22:47] dogs and they love rabbits so I'm
[22:50] chasing rabbits to keep him on getting
[22:52] the dogs and getting to Lamar but my
[22:55] point is that rabbit he can't make pain
[22:58] but if he was he'd be coming at the back
[23:00] door knocking won't get my but he gets
[23:04] thing I and that's the difference a
[23:07] human mortal tomorrow baby a baby no
[23:10] matter how small they are they thinking
[23:14] right I mean they're very something
[23:17] begins inside of them to motivate and
[23:20] it's amazing to me to seal I always
[23:22] wanted to be able to some way
[23:24] scientifically take about faith the legs
[23:28] but little Matthew is and take him and
[23:34] be able to some way get into his brain
[23:37] and here when you love to just get into
[23:40] his brain to be able to see what he was
[23:42] thinking he's looking at Cindy's
[23:43] grinning be seeing them man i got it
[23:48] made look at everyone leading the whole
[23:52] plane wasn't it anytime the only thing i
[23:55] just go man they just room I mean you
[23:59] think they don't think I lately though
[24:00] because that's the soul of the baby it's
[24:03] beginning to develop within and which
[24:05] sold means real you that's what it isn't
[24:07] so lead you let's that's the difference
[24:08] of what the animal doesn't have that
[24:11] interior he has a body in a life we have
[24:14] a body spirit and soul to make us an
[24:16] individual come on but I get the point
[24:19] that animal I couldn't come back so God
[24:23] came himself down in human flesh
[24:26] according to the scriptures Emmanuel God
[24:28] with us and he paid the price I thought
[24:32] he died did he might release him life
[24:35] right as i say of it many times we have
[24:39] the only
[24:40] religion in the world that required that
[24:43] our for our instigator are the one who
[24:47] started it maybe had to die the end is
[24:51] nigh to give his life that you and I my
[24:53] legal right that simple simple doing in
[24:56] it says he gave their life then there
[24:59] was an ability for that life to come
[25:01] back alright so there are in the Bible
[25:06] He gave His life they put him on the
[25:07] cross they didn't kill him right my sins
[25:11] and your sins is what killed Herod right
[25:14] all we had to do he said I can call
[25:16] twelve legions values we come delivering
[25:19] that's 12 Legion that's 1200 for 12,000
[25:25] close out huh wormwood destroyed the
[25:28] world water just that would take one
[25:30] right so he could call all of that but
[25:33] instead of that he he stayed there for
[25:35] you and me then we might receive that
[25:37] life that was even he answered mmm do we
[25:40] may be able to receive Jesus Christ as
[25:43] our Savior right can be able to accept
[25:46] him and let him become the one they
[25:49] would be living within us all right now
[25:51] we know God is perfect right right no
[25:54] problem good run going is perfect all
[25:58] right joy he put his lap within us yep
[26:02] right now he breaks his life and gives
[26:05] it to you and I who were that lastly
[26:07] that would have to be perfect because
[26:09] that's what he done he made it perfect
[26:11] right I am coming and living in US makes
[26:15] that sold our body spirit i'll still the
[26:17] sunny yeah I here in this body that that
[26:21] I'm here I'm still a sunny I have
[26:24] problems with this body is getting older
[26:27] it's all they think are happening do it
[26:28] right and I have a spirit within late
[26:31] which is rim the memory reason concerts
[26:33] effects it done in that real I have
[26:37] trouble living in life but as a
[26:40] Christian inside of us the our soul has
[26:45] been my eternal by the new birth
[26:46] whatever you want to call it being born
[26:49] again salvation
[26:50] your words you want to use coming to a
[26:53] place to accept Jesus Christ as your
[26:55] Savior not just a little talk that's
[26:58] what a lot of people teach and believe
[27:00] that salvation is a mental thought but
[27:03] it's not it's an experience of Jesus
[27:06] Christ coming and living within you cuz
[27:10] that was the Rings again he could give
[27:12] us a little talk without having to die
[27:15] true right and with us did you know but
[27:18] he had to die to release his life Evan
[27:21] that life to come back in me and you
[27:23] yeah and to give us then his own life
[27:27] well I've been his life is perfect yeah
[27:30] bad right as I said we look at the baby
[27:33] and we say what's perfect in our eyes it
[27:37] is the little grandbabies ladies man
[27:42] they can get you you know t ho I want a
[27:45] puppy with you and I gonna be alone
[27:49] you'll have a puppy one because it if
[27:52] you just can't stand them little eyes
[27:55] looking at you talking you know and all
[27:58] of that this gets in the heart and
[28:00] everything we know that's the way God
[28:02] does us he hears our prayers yours are
[28:07] crying out unto him saying Lord forgive
[28:10] me I guess I didn't mean to do that I
[28:14] didn't need to go that away I need more
[28:16] rest more in you and just be a Christian
[28:18] not to be worth if we look at somebody
[28:20] said well you think you're perfect know
[28:22] I know I'm not perfect but he's perfect
[28:27] he's living inside of me where he living
[28:31] that part is perfectly good my Bible
[28:34] said God will dwell in an unclean vessel
[28:36] all right now if he won't dwell we're
[28:39] seeing as that then it would have to
[28:42] take away the sin and that's what he
[28:44] does he comes to you and I we accept him
[28:47] as our side here and he comes to the
[28:49] lives in us to make our soul eternal
[28:52] right all right now I know that a lot of
[28:55] doctrines of people is it like we're
[28:57] going to get eternal life over there
[28:58] that's the sign that's
[29:00] you're looking at but why would Jesus
[29:04] cries out to die if it's gonna be over
[29:06] there he died to release his life now I
[29:10] to make this as we read there in the
[29:12] scripts right about the children of God
[29:14] Oh Congress is all free man what about
[29:20] being the children of Almighty God Evan
[29:22] and you know the thing of it is we know
[29:24] the truth about it we god no how no
[29:27] grandchildren he ain't like of us he
[29:32] don't have grandchildren he had sons and
[29:35] daughters all right now the reason I'm
[29:37] saying that is and sometimes he asked a
[29:39] witless right then that can tell you
[29:43] he's only one that ever got a spike in
[29:45] of the grandkids and I really whooped
[29:47] him good i mean i just really you know
[29:49] one day like that and he cried for an
[29:51] hour but because he didn't know pop all
[29:53] can do stuff like that well little happy
[29:55] she's come along you know we've had to i
[29:57] minus her a little bit no he it's just
[30:01] the way it is but see you're trying to
[30:03] raise the child to were that the child
[30:07] do what's right no you heard about that
[30:10] he was going up down the ladder never
[30:11] taught me two years old about three and
[30:14] lisa well i used to take him out set him
[30:18] up home instead of reading right up on
[30:19] the top of the peak of the roof of a
[30:21] house that was dirty foot off the excite
[30:23] and he just said sorry you know and he
[30:26] said popo i'm flying us now you're not
[30:28] you can't get off he set up her Whitney
[30:30] you know we we would be working on times
[30:32] but thee sometimes you have to correct
[30:37] your children's by and God has to
[30:38] correct other side don't we already his
[30:41] offspring and he wants us to raise up to
[30:43] be right but you raise a child to be
[30:46] right I don't want to raise a child up
[30:49] to be uh you know they're bad enough as
[30:51] it is because living in life but you
[30:54] don't want to raise them up to worth it
[30:55] there this to spoil brat sometimes you
[30:59] gotta say to the kids no you don't get
[31:00] it I don't like it of course like I said
[31:06] now the grandkids come along and they
[31:07] say daddy I want it near more in for
[31:09] more lenient in on maybe in half get
[31:12] back to the story
[31:14] salvation comes and lives within each
[31:16] one of us i saw crash 94 that's right he
[31:19] died to give us his old life to make us
[31:22] a new creature we've been talking about
[31:24] a new creation me we're not still the
[31:29] same as we was inwardly outwardly we
[31:32] look the same salvation is not in your
[31:35] body it is not in your spirit is in your
[31:38] soul it makes a soul eternal alright
[31:41] then from dire is supposed to work out
[31:43] where this right the life of God out
[31:47] through you and I to were that we can
[31:49] accept Corrections and in doing you know
[31:53] and be his children to be his offspring
[31:56] but one because they said now the blood
[31:59] of bulls and goats imma let me do was
[32:01] cover right but the blood of jesus
[32:05] christ he release the life right yeah
[32:12] cuz the animal heads instead alive and
[32:14] he has a blood and think but it is no
[32:17] solar but when Jesus Christ came up on
[32:20] earth you would body spirit and soul oh
[32:22] mighty God huh the Yeti was in flesh
[32:26] like we are his body was a virgin born
[32:29] body not either he demon huh Mary didn't
[32:33] produce the egg because we did that
[32:35] would have made the body coming from
[32:36] from area and that will work or the
[32:39] virgin birth is the creative old egg and
[32:41] sperm and put them together all Mary was
[32:44] with an incubator all right you see that
[32:47] today man right right we're in a day
[32:50] when when the virgin birth can be seen
[32:52] easily won because you can go down there
[32:54] they can have a test tube baby right
[32:56] right right take a journey from this one
[33:00] of the sperm from this one put it in our
[33:03] Joseph virgin birth and what it was a
[33:05] man that God created the egg his firm
[33:08] remember what the words you want to use
[33:09] German whatever the words you want to
[33:11] use
[33:11] Nikoli for it Lee and when he did Mary
[33:15] was it was an incubator right that's why
[33:17] he never did show in description he
[33:18] never called her mother right now listen
[33:21] I got a little sense I may look Don but
[33:24] I got a little since I know when he was
[33:25] a baby called her mother right right I
[33:28] mean he did go around saying who are you
[33:30] he knew who it was he called her mother
[33:32] but when it come up in his life to his
[33:34] head of his men entered his ministry and
[33:37] begin to preach she never called her
[33:39] mother anymore he called a woman why
[33:42] because even she rejected him as to be
[33:46] in virgin born the hell up to the time
[33:49] he's about 12 years old remember the
[33:50] temple they come back hunting him and
[33:53] she said your father and I right there
[33:58] was really saying Joseph is his dad he
[34:03] turned around and rebuked her he said I
[34:06] must be about my father's yesterday but
[34:09] she showed up and hurried it because she
[34:13] knew that he was correcting her the word
[34:17] was what was doing it right because it
[34:19] was God coming down to give his own life
[34:22] and you and I right so you could come to
[34:24] this place of being perfect right man
[34:26] Marnie now it may have been down through
[34:30] time that we didn't understand these
[34:32] things we understood that you earth and
[34:35] the things but we might not have talked
[34:37] about it but I've heard people arguing
[34:38] discuss it what Jesus were talking about
[34:41] you know i'll be there for perfect and
[34:43] you know over what i just read it i
[34:45] could say as he required it and God made
[34:47] away and he did so in the end time at
[34:51] the revelation that's why we read in
[34:52] Peter the race that is to be brought to
[34:57] you and I at the revelation of Jesus
[35:00] Christ in the meantime we are to receive
[35:04] the revelation to finish of all things
[35:06] you agree no that's the purpose of us
[35:08] being here we were to come down to this
[35:10] end time and we started all regarding
[35:12] Peter where it said that the appearing
[35:16] Jesus Christ all right now the other
[35:19] scripts you'll find at the coming of
[35:21] Jesus Christ cuz he can appear along
[35:24] today and that not literally be his
[35:27] coming he's coming is through the
[35:30] revealed Word and then it brought to you
[35:32] and I that's right he appeared in the
[35:34] end time wants to pay the price all
[35:37] right so everything's pointing down to
[35:39] where we're at right we are the people
[35:43] at the end of the earth of coming home
[35:45] honey we're the ones that Hebrews 11 40
[35:48] says they without us cannot be made
[35:51] perfect right that we're perfect means
[35:56] of completeness full age you know you
[36:01] look at a child you say they've said
[36:03] Luke look Lou Matthew a specter knees he
[36:07] said well he's perfect but that means
[36:09] he's got every part unless something
[36:11] goes wrong with him in life you know
[36:14] some happen he's got his fingers he's
[36:17] got his toes he's got it dude he hung
[36:19] out some teeth before long then you know
[36:22] when I'll Lydia start biting Matthew for
[36:24] calling in Matthew ace mr. days Matthew
[36:27] but do he'll see he begins to develop
[36:33] would have but against no new parts
[36:38] right in the Christian life we don't
[36:41] gain hearts as we go along we gain
[36:44] growth development we grow up right you
[36:49] read the Bible then you read it but then
[36:52] you go back one day you read it again
[36:54] and it begins to open up you begin to
[36:58] see more we go back you read it again
[37:01] you begin to see one because a growth
[37:04] development is happening heaven so then
[37:08] you don't dare turn around a little
[37:09] little ace when he gets about five years
[37:12] old and you handing the keys to him and
[37:14] go get out of the car no no no goes its
[37:19] growth developments not enough right
[37:21] when you're 25 you can rust amenities
[37:24] you notice that I said 25
[37:27] no no that's we all kids are they power
[37:31] start out they have all the wrecks in
[37:34] the first year that's why when they
[37:36] hadn't come along you know the boys egg
[37:38] roll clunkers it didn't make them here
[37:40] long as they got the earth it didn't
[37:42] matter Volkswagens or road trucks or
[37:45] whatever you know low and chanukah long
[37:47] you know everybody is you gonna buy a
[37:50] new car huh we found her a
[37:54] four-hundred-dollar toyota corolla for
[37:57] the bureaucrats headed we bought it nana
[38:00] looked at it she said daddy you mean you
[38:04] want me to drive that that's it n and
[38:09] many kids in schools got a car 16 years
[38:14] old got car none so I said drive it I
[38:22] was in the first year so if you have any
[38:24] reaction or Nothing right turns up any
[38:27] honey well when she come alone after a
[38:29] while we bought her a nice ricardinho
[38:31] honey one because she learned her to
[38:34] drive that's the way God does he starts
[38:37] at all and he lives out of races and
[38:43] then he knows how to raise children
[38:44] don't let him he did well sometimes he
[38:50] says no you can't have that yeah but
[38:56] daddy I wanted no you're not old enough
[39:00] yet alright so Ashley does in the Bible
[39:02] that in the Word of God he he gives us
[39:07] gradually what we have need of habit our
[39:11] growth development starts to wear that
[39:13] we can comprehend dammit that's right
[39:15] the funds all right and to do that means
[39:18] that grace must be hard probably read
[39:21] that scripture brought to you too grace
[39:23] that is to be revealed at the revelation
[39:27] of Jesus Christ Oh grace is unmerited
[39:30] favor but it's a wonderful word of
[39:35] saying you don't deserve what you're
[39:39] getting
[39:40] that's their right much call American
[39:43] fight was a good webster huh but it's
[39:47] saying you don't deserve it but I'm

[41:42] reading and studying God's Word I
[41:44] learned to overcome a man what I'm
[41:47] really learning is is the nature of my
[41:49] father all right Evan at that right
[41:53] because that way I'm learning that my
[41:56] father didn't do these things right

[42:55] take it easy I'm not going to hurt
[42:57] somebody but see God knows how to train
[43:00] his chew em I think you're right but he
[43:05] does it's my giving his word you know

[43:58] daddy is if I was orphaned and somebody
[44:00] raised me I take you over who I had for
[44:03] my mom and dad right you know what not
[44:08] what my father to have all the honor and
[44:11] glory for raising me right right Evan I
[44:14] won't even reveal yourself to me through
[44:16] the words rang it on and show me hey
[44:19] Jimmy its nature show me his waves
[44:21] through the word I lead in the word and
[44:24] I found out it you know he would turn
[44:27] the other cheek what I need to get that
[44:30] nature I want that nature of him there
[44:33] of his nature his character because i'm
[44:37] wanting to be a new creation the word
[44:40] creation our creature is the same word
[44:41] which you know it is it's really Jesus
[44:46] Christ came down upon the earth he was a
[44:47] new creation I thought that he was not
[44:51] of the old he was not a product of the
[44:54] virgin birth prove that he was not a
[44:56] product of the old nature of ways of man
[44:59] he was a new creation event all right he
[45:04] proved it in his life and living happily
[45:06] when he was a kid whose kid I'm desert I
[45:09] don't believe he was in living I'm going
[45:12] to hurt a lot
[45:13] never have thought nothing like that I'm
[45:14] always thought he was raised up he was
[45:18] raised in a good family and good home
[45:19] and taking care of you know all of that
[45:22] and you heard a trade he was partner you
[45:26] learn a trade with somebody right you
[45:28] know and you went out making his own
[45:30] living oh you know really furniture all
[45:34] right but in that it was Almighty God
[45:37] showing himself right as I said even had
[45:41] to correct his mother when he was like
[45:42] 12 13 years Overson because she was
[45:47] wrong you see then when come down to
[45:50] words it was that she learned enough
[45:52] confidence in him because you remember
[45:53] the first thing that happened he went to
[45:55] a wedding you remember in the Bible when
[45:56] it first starts his ministry and he went
[45:59] to a wedding and they were running out
[46:01] of wine since she's goes to him and said
[46:07] no Jesus they're running out of one he
[46:09] said my times not yet did you know but
[46:15] she didn't take that house she doesn't
[46:16] sing him all through it laughs and
[46:18] seeing the way later than what he done
[46:19] should she goes over the pic would say
[46:21] whatever he says do you do it right so
[46:26] we turn to reading okay pour water out
[46:28] and it became wine all right now he had
[46:34] the nature of God because he was gone
[46:36] all right then we need to have the
[46:39] nature of God heaven living within other
[46:41] it would solve a lot of our problems you
[46:44] know there's like I say the kids wear
[46:46] that little band around on her arm you
[46:48] know what would Jesus do well that's
[46:51] good as long as they're doing it right
[46:53] you know but you know you say well walk
[46:57] with Jesus doing it so if I say
[46:58] something you punch him in the no that's
[47:00] not exactly the way that Jesus was doing
[47:02] that you know I think it was a kid but
[47:07] yet he was a wonderful kid at a man
[47:09] that's right you know but just think
[47:12] about it now that's what I'm trying to
[47:13] get you to see at the revelation of
[47:17] Jesus Christ another word here at the
[47:18] end time when God has opened the
[47:22] unto us I given us the understanding of
[47:26] God of these words to be able to see who
[47:28] we are I think what we're doing and
[47:31] what's happening then you know in life
[47:36] and do it and we even know by reading
[47:39] the Bible what will happen when we leave
[47:41] here I think God will turn to Israel and
[47:44] save them right we know that there will
[47:46] be a millennial reign is recorded in the
[47:48] Bible and for a thousand years of
[47:51] perfect peace upon this earth and thanks
[47:53] and then they'll be an Armageddon or
[47:56] battles and things that will take place
[47:58] alright and then there'll be a future
[48:02] home if we read in Revelation 2 21 22
[48:05] right in there we know all about this
[48:07] one because he's given us his word
[48:09] that's right and by giving us his word
[48:12] he's given us that revelation of Jesus
[48:15] Christ right Emmett thought is the
[48:18] prophet of God said if you read the
[48:20] Bible and they'll see Jesus and then
[48:21] reverse back reading again mmm well I
[48:24] admit I read the guy she lunch what we
[48:26] got short sojourn to open got cilantro
[48:27] until I got tired of reading so intro we
[48:30] got so and so but then I realized one
[48:32] day that right in the middle of all that
[48:34] it would say something that would be a
[48:36] real key that I needed an understanding
[48:39] so I went back and I read it again right
[48:41] all right because it was showing the
[48:43] ledge right now handling it would come
[48:47] down to where this lineage come from
[48:48] this and this group come from this and I
[48:51] needed to know those signs not that I
[48:53] had to have it as a Christian but to
[48:55] know the leads of God coming down
[48:58] through mankind would come out to Jesus
[49:01] Christ that's the Langley that's right
[49:02] that's right you can see who we are and
[49:06] what we're doing is the hour that we're
[49:08] living right this is the time to come to
[49:11] understanding who you are right Luther
[49:16] taught the judge shall live by faith we
[49:18] believe that Wesley come along call
[49:22] sanctification we believe that the bag
[49:24] has come along with bringing back
[49:26] eternal security
[49:28] and immersing by going daily water you
[49:31] know and bringing back the baptism not
[49:34] going in the water with it cuz imagine
[49:36] this had got forth with the sprinkling
[49:38] is that i'm not against all that i'm
[49:39] just showing you that each one of those
[49:41] and a truth for their time and then we
[49:44] came in around the zoo the street and
[49:46] there you come in what you call a
[49:47] Pentecostal people as they begin to
[49:51] speak in tongues and Sons & wonders
[49:53] begin at a place and that's where we're
[49:56] at we come down here to an end nor God
[49:59] is people unfolding right to the end of
[50:04] quote Monaco the end of the earth is
[50:05] come you used to enter look around a bit
[50:10] when I talking about tomorrow and
[50:12] whenever code I've never been concerned
[50:14] about when the end of the world would
[50:15] come I'm concerned about getting ready
[50:18] to accept Jesus Christ and walk off the
[50:21] earth well I'm not concerned with dates
[50:24] and times and seasons and Paul said I'm
[50:26] a scared of the eye because you do those
[50:29] things right but that's just people
[50:31] trying to figure out things right all
[50:33] right we come down to where we are the
[50:35] end time that the word is open unto us
[50:38] not a sinister the word through the way
[50:41] of a profit that would leave came and
[50:43] brought us to life stay messy all right
[50:45] do we believe that and we want with it
[50:47] but we don't make that profit God we
[50:51] don't worship no man we worship Jesus
[50:53] Christ we do as Paul said won't sit
[50:57] follow me is I Pollock rock all right
[51:00] I'll follow anybody that follows christ
[51:03] ever had right because we need someone
[51:07] to help us we are human morals that need
[51:10] someone to guide us and better all right
[51:13] we follow anyone who would lead us to it
[51:15] you said I believe in all of the real
[51:18] cute true genuine Christian if we follow
[51:21] HYFR then we walk in the light yeah man
[51:24] all right then when we do we come forth
[51:27] as being one God wall right he wants his
[51:31] nature to be instilled in us then I'm
[51:34] just to be babies right you don't want
[51:38] us to stay babies we just a picture
[51:40] all of all the kids from the baby was
[51:42] born up to there whatever age they were
[51:46] but I was looking at that one day my
[51:48] thought we ought to be good you could
[51:50] pick out an age and say well I was late
[51:51] at that one did you say that our tariffs
[51:54] has happened and at that one you know
[51:55] but you know what if I stayed are we
[51:57] with the hell no Matthew and Josh it we
[52:05] will now know that right so it's really
[52:08] selfish to think about what we do we
[52:12] shouldn't want our kids to just remain
[52:14] right as they are they brought into the
[52:19] world for the purpose of growing up
[52:20] right and having their own family now I
[52:25] don't believe in pushing them out and
[52:26] make them get married no I believe you
[52:28] just wait around long enough you find a
[52:30] rough life than ever and then when you
[52:32] do that'll be your wife I'm leaving
[52:34] praying no for a wife all right in the
[52:39] Nano that'll take care of it but you
[52:41] what I'm saying we are new creation in
[52:44] Christ Jesus and he keeps unfolding his
[52:48] word to show us his ways and what he
[52:52] wants out of your night we're not in the
[52:56] days of all of the things that would
[52:59] happen in the bag on days we're here in
[53:02] the end of all things and we're saying
[53:04] Lord come on the scene now and give us
[53:07] what she wants to have because that is
[53:12] the grace grace God promised it right he
[53:18] promised to bring us to the place that
[53:22] they could be a change of these bodies
[53:25] there could be an end of all things they
[53:27] can be a rat sure that we spoke out of
[53:29] me of that he promised that well like I
[53:35] said to start with them when he said me
[53:38] therefore perfect if that's God's Word
[53:42] then God is required to make away for
[53:47] somebody to reach that so he did to
[53:50] himself amen
[53:52] alright George we're going to take a
[53:53] change to the body we're going to have a
[53:55] rapture whatever words you want to use
[53:58] and terminologies see then he made from
[54:06] he promised it lion you better believe
[54:11] my kids my grandkids I what I had to do
[54:14] they say daddy can we nice and we'll
[54:16] make well they just got ready yeah oh
[54:20] they knew whatever possible could be
[54:22] done I do it because I would give him my
[54:25] word me and I didn't want to break it I
[54:28] wanted to do what I could do that we see
[54:31] God when he gives his word he came right
[54:33] back heaven he got to keep it I that's
[54:37] why he says our description Romans 10
[54:38] hell you want to be excited than what is
[54:41] the clue believe in your heart confess
[54:47] with your mouth right now it's fine to
[54:52] believe in the heart whether we don't
[54:54] confess with thy mouth more but it's
[54:58] good to believe in the heart but if we
[54:59] know you know if we don't have it in our
[55:01] mind our thinking I do believe and then
[55:06] confess alright so what do we need at
[55:14] the revelation of Jesus crown can we
[55:20] believe that Jesus Christ with Almighty
[55:22] God that drivin now know the Trinity
[55:25] doctrine and etc is the oneness I know
[55:28] both sides of the doctrinal issues of
[55:30] the teachings of the Godhead but yet I
[55:35] believe what your mom will say hey there
[55:38] my old said he was born Lord the Christ
[55:41] the Bible said he was a man you and God
[55:43] with us
[55:44] all right he came down to play the prize
[55:47] it's you and I and that would
[55:49] opportunity to be cited hey all right
[55:51] then why are we looking for another gone
[55:53] or another thought right that's right
[55:55] yeah but we've been taught that us
[55:57] that's fine because you taught that you
[55:59] come down to life yeah but now let's get
[56:02] down to read the Bible hey that's right
[56:05] jesus said unless you believe that i am
[56:07] he you will dine you're safe now
[56:11] according the gospel right so it wasn't
[56:17] two or three guards Almighty God made
[56:20] manifest in human flesh yeah that's
[56:22] right yes their old testimony was called
[56:25] Jehovah God Father and wouldn't call it
[56:27] son in Jesus Christ upon the earth now

[56:32] Spirit you're a fonder right your son
[56:41] run mother Kali your father okay
