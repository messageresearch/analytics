only on for them that wants to move that's right nice to catch you you want to move it's on for you hey man good to see everybody in the house of the Lord and have everybody with us I think we have a visitor with us today by the time being here we always say weather second time you come be part of it so whatever just we don't have anything here to join we don't have to do anything and everything we just part of the body of Christ good to see your brothers and sister back there amen so we get ready to just hear the word of the Lord sit back and listen because that's what we're intended to do thank you for all of the time that we spent to coming together we had a wonderful time Friday night Saturday night and and looking forward today and then looking forward to you know a time together after we finish the the natural meals you know I mean the spiritual meals then we go to eat a natural meal we want everybody to stay and eat with us and just have a good time and all in the Lord we appreciate you ahead of time for fixing and making everything ready appreciate sister Gail she always fix the flowers for the the Easter time because this sea is the resurrection this is the resurrection thank God for the resurrection you know we went for the resurrection it wouldn't be any good for me and you right so let's just sing that he is here because see the way that I tell you and you know it the way God is here is through the faithful Ministry to speak to you in a minute that's the way he's here so he's Rising yeah he's not dead Easter the prophet said prove what all Jesus said the large statements could be made was it when he raised that saw the problem amen that settled the whole thing proved who he was so then let's just sing that brother he is here I will explain it it was a loud message foreign I know holy holy holy Christ amen well one thing to see him in the prophet is one thing to see him in your pastor in the ministry the the deacons the elders the trustees another thing deceiving yourself that's it you want to see him in his word because we're not going to assume in a physical form and we don't see him in his word as well and so God help us today just to minister the word that will make make it a reality to us right amen he is always today as always he's the central theme of our gathering nice and purpose uh for our uh our living our breathing our existence our very existence is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ holy holy holy you know I love singing brother Madam talked about singing so much I love singing and and just what's accomplished uh by singing I think Saul had an evil spirit one day or it's evil spirits one day and uh you know what delivered with good songs amen he called for David said bring the heart start playing start singing those beautiful glorious songs and all of a sudden the spirits just lifted and uh and that's the purpose of a song service that's the purpose of the song service that's right and you know brother vanson about singing he said uh well he talks he says number one he said you know he said this Bible is a dispensational book God's a dispensational god brother Bantam found out he was a dispensationalist and he said every Revival he said produces its own songwriters because when God unfolds more of his word their songwriters here to pick it up and take that Revelation and put it to music and we sing about those things that have such a a present tense meaning and it reinforces those very things that your pastor speaks from wait expect those things and uh I say this and I'm thinking that it's not gonna be critical by any means but the little song uh that we were singing uh uh every promise in the book is mine right and it just struck me so wait wait not really not really there's a lot of promises brother man said there's in the message unbelieving God he said there's 600 something Promises to the bride all right now those are the ones you want to claim but really you don't want to claim every promise in the book because there's a promise of tribulation to a lot of people who respect I want to claim that one there's a promise of Hell to the wicked and I don't recline see there's there's a promise there's many there's Promises to the Jews that ain't gonna apply to us so I can't I can't claim his promise or that promise so is is we are as well dispensationalists we look in the scriptures we see well that applies to me that applies to me that's a promise to the bride that's a promise thing you see what I'm saying those are the ones we want to claim right right so you know it might be better every promise in the book that's mine I will claim through the there was love divine you see be more specific so that's the way we are this message has made us it's made us specific about things and so right A lot of times I know back back home into your pastor brother Wade has been there we have we have a projector here you're the lower ceiling wouldn't allow you to do that but we project our uh songs back there and the brothers have the computer and we can even just change words on the Fly because sometimes we'll be singing a song yeah and it's you know that might be good in the Pentecostal age of the back because all the songs that we have were written in other ages that's recently got Pentecostal songs and back to songs about not to say the meaning of those you know we can't still sing those because I like Amazing Grace they'll always be amazing grace to us but we're going to understand Grace like the world they don't understand and so uh and so uh dog's just doing wonderful things among us and we certainly love him uh today uh now let's just get right to the word this morning I want to read two verses of uh two places let's get to Revelation chapter one verse 17 and 18 and then also be turning to Second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7. and while you're turning I want to say how much I have thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed my visit here first time in Louisville Georgia I trust it won't be my last not necessary to come to preach but just a fellowship with uh with your pastor and I find it just to be just a wonderful brother lovely brother and it's just an honor for me and really I see if my bottom of my heart just an honor for me to be here my brother Jim sister Darlene from our assemblies come come with me and we appreciate them coming and nothing's expensive anymore getting your car traveling there it's it's just expensive to do that but uh we've had such a wonderful wonderful time I met your pastor probably been 15 18 years ago I don't know if you remember it was a Gerald Hughes ministers meeting way way back when and uh we didn't really get a lot of course there's 15 20 minutes to get a lot of time to just disband him and we just kind of long cut lost contact and went our separate ways and so forth so I'm glad the Lord has brought us back together not something I orchestrated I didn't look through a message directory and say what's I'm gonna call him and it doesn't work that way so the Lord knows who to put together he knows who knows whose spirit is going to be commensurate and spirit and so forth right so um so we just want to say how thankful we are for the sisters that have cooked meals and and just tended to us God bless you richly for that I just appreciate it so so so so very very much Revelation chapter 1 verse 17. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I'm the first to have the last now John's speaking also was the type of the Bride saying fear not I'm the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death of hell and of death amen all right now let's go also over to Second Timothy chapter one and verse 7. excuse me the Apostle Paul speaking Apostle Paul speaking second Timothy chapter one and verse 7. now watch his words here for God hath not given us the spirit of fear right right but of power and of love and of a sound mind let me read it again for God has not given us a spirit of fear right exactly the power and of love and of the sound of my couldn't could we just throw our hands in a word of prayer this morning heavenly father it's it's an honor it's a privilege to assemble on this Sunday morning the Lord to honor the resurrection and it is the day that we've set aside Lord to be conscious and uh remembering what you have accomplished this day brother Adam said it was the day that he proved everything that he said we've become the benefactors of that Resurrection he said what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is because he lives we can live also thank you for that Lord thank you for that father so Lord as we turn our attention toward the word uh today I would pray as David did let my tongue be is the pen of a ready writer to take the word Lord May the Holy Spirit and describe it on the tables of our hearts that we might be written Epistles unto God known and read of all men may we be a walking letter a walking word a walking representation of the Lord Jesus Christ in whom we love and appreciate and adore thank you Father for our time together May the Holy Spirit weave this word into the fabric of our soul that we might live here leave here a better people better prepared to face the challenges and the adversaries Lord the forces that Satan has placed out there the 200 million demons and so forth you have a strength to overcome in this hour for we'll ask in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ all of God's people said praise the Lord praise the Lord God bless you may be seated amen this morning I want to uh I want to wax more pastoral this morning Sunday morning is generally the time uh to do that so uh I had several ways that we could go but the Lord just seemed to impress this direction on our hearts I ran across I ran across a quote a while back that I'd like to share with you this morning and this pretty much kind of give me the foundation uh to go in this direction brother Benham said in the message is really katus barnia he said the greatest thing I find against the church tonight is fear right right the greatest thing I find this is Brother Adam's observation she's looking out over the Turks and he said the greatest thing I find he said tonight in the church's fear Everybody's scared to death about something he said what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy right and free just like these fellas singing up here and the brother testified back there he said just read there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ God has promised interesting statement isn't it the greatest thing I find against the church tonight is fear right now let me qualify that granted he made this statement 58 years ago and it certainly won't be this way when the bride leaves the Earth nevertheless the prophet is identifying what he would perceive to be an obvious problem uh in the church as was the Apostle Paul as he wrote to Timothy and he said God has not given us the spirit of fear so he must have seen it as well among his people all right so where did it come from he said now God didn't give us the spirit of fear but what he did give us is this he gave us the spirit of love and of power and of a sound mind which actually means a uh a sane mind right it means the same mind a mind of a singer in one's in one's senses fear of them according to Paul is contrasted with soundness of mind or sanity of of the Mind one comes from God and the other comes from the devil so if there's fear present then it'll always serve to to buff it or to fight with your true sanity or your true soundness of mine all right and so once again it gets right back to the greatest battle ever fault the Battleground being the mind is that right now in the message the way to have Fellowship in Chicago 1955 brother Ben said there's only two faculties that govern a human one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear right which has no value in it all so if we're not being being led and motivated and encouraged by by faith and walked by faith which brings the results the others fear which has no value in it at all right faith is of god fear is of the devil fear makes you worry and fear makes you wonder right now I want to speak uh for a few minutes this morning on the subject of uh a subject of fear obviously you probably figured that out you'll appreciate my uh my uh my grasp on the obvious I'm sure would you believe that fear is mentioned 385 times in your Bible 385 times another 189 times the word afraid is spoken of and you'll uh if you dig a Little Deeper you'll find that the phrase is fear not fear ye not you shall not fear fear no evil be not afraid or nor be afraid another 101 times in the Bible so almost 600 times the Bible draws your attention to some kind of fear right brother random mentioned fear or fright almost 3 000 times now when a prophet and the word of God give a subject that much attention I'm thinking there must be something to it right man something maybe we ought to ought to look at is it any Wonder Jesus said in the end time Luke 21 26 men's Hearts would be failing them for what fear so it's a very present entity this spirit of fear is that right so I just want us to be conscious and we don't do it just a little bit uh of these things that we already know but just to be remembered and reminded of these things now the word that is used for fear is uh is the Greek word Phobos fomos and it means that which strikes Terror yeah and of course Phobos is the word from which we get our English word phobia how many has ever heard of the word phobia I mean that's what a phobia is a phobia refers to a panic that is completely out of proportion to the perceived threat behind it right let me say that again it's a panic that is completely out of proportion to the perceived threat that's behind it right now the dictionary defines phobia as an intense persistent abnormal irrational or illogical fear of a specific thing or situation that compels an individual to avoid the feared stimulus despite the awareness and reassurance that it's not dangerous it's an exaggerated and often disabling fear usually unexplainable inexplicable or baffling or incomprehensible or mysterious to the subject and having sometimes a logical but unusually and illogical or symbolic effect what a phobia is now the Discovery Channel a few years ago they did a story on the top 10 phobias that people have I don't know you always make studies about everything so they looked at and they questioned a lot of people what are your phobias what are you scared of what are you scared of and let me just share a few of them with you number 10 was necrophobia you know what that is that's the fear of death They concluded that it causes some people to worry so much about dying that they just have very little quality of life because they're just so worried about dying number nine was brontophobia now that's not the fear of brontosauruses that's not what it is it's the it's the fear of thunderstorms you ever known anybody who's afraid of thunderstorms well many people are I read a little story a story a little while back it said One Summer Night During a severe thunderstorm a mother was tucking her small son into bed she's about to turn the light off when he asked in a trembling voice mommy would you stay with me all night smiling the mother gave him a warm reassuring hug and said tenderly I can't deer I have to sleep in Daddy's room a long silence followed at last it was broken by a shaky voice saying the big the mind of a child bro Dan told a similar story in a mighty God and Bill remember that he said you must bear and not mine we go to church certainly we read the Bible we pray we are a Christian family we believe in God and we believe that in storms and whatever goes on God is our protection he said Mama I believe every bit of that she's talking to a little boy mom I believe every bit of that but when that life amen amen he said so I think not only junior he said but all of us feel that way right and then number five the Discovery Channel found out through their polling that number five was claustrophobia of course it's the fear of being trapped in a small space or confined space and then number four was agoraphobia and that's the fear of open places and wouldn't have thought that number three was aerophobia which of course is the fear of flying and surprisingly the number one fear among the people that were polled is arachnophobia and of course that's the spirit uh Spider it's the number one fear that people have affecting half of all women and one out of ten men now that's a fair with you can't really I mean you know and that really got you gripped the cancer is not the place you want to be and we not only have the black widows but we have the brown recluse and they can make a mess of you when they go to bite you what not we got them everywhere right got them everywhere so you got to kind of watch the spiders uh psychologists tell us that they're actually they've identified over 530 types of phobias or what they call phobic disorders or phobic neuroses that they've discovered in their treatment people over the years now now really what they're talking about is the devil they just give him a name right over 530 different fears that people come forward and say I just feel different whatever and so that's what they've done now some of them are let me let me share with you some of the more obscure phobias that you've probably never even heard of and maybe even never knew they existed I'll skimp through some of them there's mysophobia which is the fear of dirt there's erythrophobia which is the fear of blushing there is uh the fear of beards a pogonophobia by the way if you find people avoiding you can't figure out why they might be scared of your beard and there's a fear for that there's a scientists tell that there's a fear they got poking a phobia you might want to say dude got poking a phobia what do you see what I'm saying yeah so we're getting a little education here then there is neophobia which is the fear of anything new there's the fear of becoming bald how acrophobia it's called there's the fear of animals zoophobia there's a fear of wild animals which is agrazophobia I read a story about uh two explorers that were on a Jungle Safari uh when suddenly there was the Ferocious lion jumped out in front of him and the first explorer whispered to the second he said now keep calm remember what we read in a book about wild animals if you stand perfectly still and let the iron in a line in the eye he'll turn and run sure said the other fella you read the book and I've read the book but has the lion read the book I think you know that's right and there's a fear of childbirth there's four words for that tocophobia man and I won't read all those there's the fear of children the pedophile yeah there's uh I'm sorry excuse me pedophobia and a pedophobia pedophobia then there's the fear of hairy people there's the fear of water there's a fear of being afraid and all these have a phobia there's a fear there's cyber phobia that's that's the fear of computers are working on computers a lot of people you find got that cyber phobia right and that's where you got Brothers like brother Joe Brother Richard different ones like that now he used that cyber phobia if that's what you got there's uh there's a fear of religion theophobia there's a fear of hurricanes and tornadoes a fear of gain and weight obesiophobia there's a fear of marriage gamiophobia there's a fear of listen this there's a fear of your mother-in-law a panther Brothers now you got a name point now you got a name for it brother pantheraphobia there's the fear of Growing Old there's a fear of ugliness hechophobia can you guess what odontophobia is believe it or not it's the fear of teeth you can imagine that the fear of teeth there's a fear of wealth called Pluto phobia there's a fear of work called ergophobia I run into these kind of folks there's a fear of long words get this hippopotomonstrosis quip to daliophobia fear of long words I just feel almost just come on me as I read that yeah so you're just saying it two or three times getting into fear of long words but perhaps the two most dangerous phobias of all are ecclesiophobia and homophobia you know what things are these are the fear of church and the fear of sermons yeah this might be why you're past you couldn't see some of you every service wake up it might be a homophobiac fear of churches you might be an ecclesiophobia you have a fear of sermons see so now you got a name for your fear yeah if you have either one of these phobias today brother sister you're in trouble you're in trouble how many has ever experienced fear before you ever experienced fear sure we've all experienced fear at one time or another one author writes that fear is the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind yeah somebody said to be human is to experience fear and there's truth to that right and for some that just seems to be no limit to their fears the truth is that every person every Christian has to wrestle they have to battle with their own fears of some sort right some perhaps greater than others Corey ten Boom once said in my times of fear I don't wrestle I Nestle drawings are close to my Lord and Master that I feel his continual shelter and protection did you know the Apostle Paul admitted to having fears within the great Apostle Paul II Corinthians 7 and 5 he said for when we came to Macedonia we had not rest but we were troubled on every side without we're fighting within we're fears right so just like you and me he experienced the fear of inadequacy the fear of failing we're told that Moses struggled with some things right he had some fears we read of Leah it read of Leah in the Bible she had a fear of rejection how about job job had various fears Elijah had fears and the list goes on and on and on but nevertheless do you realize that that that babies human beings are born with only two uh instinctive or two basic fears to inherent fears did you know that only two were born with it one is the fear of loud noises get around a baby oh I think that's that's a natural fear and the other is the fear of unexpected falling those are the only two fears all of the other fears are actually learned fears or fears that are are developed or given to us or put on us at some time in our lives right and we read a few minutes ago that God has not given us the spirit of fear right amen see well where did it come from all right see he's given us the spirit of love and a part and of a sound mind now in the scriptures there's about six variations of the Hebrew word that's translated sound mind it generally means to be in control of your senses it means to be sane right it means to be sober to be tempered it speaks of one who's able to curb his desires or curb his impulses it speaks of a call to moderation and self-control and that's what the scripture speaks of of a sound mind and so this is what God says I will give you this I want you to have this I want you to to to be adorned in this this sanity this sound mind this same mind and I think that's where you'll find I think in Romans 12 welcome to be not conform to the world but transformed by what the renewing of your mind and a word transform is actually translated right and it's the same word you'll find in Matthew 17 where Jesus taketh Peter James and John up to the Mount of transfiguration and was transformed or translated before them right so so here this mind element there must be a transformation of the Mind before there's a translation of these bodies amen think of that so there's a connection here now so God says I'm going to give you A sound mind amen and brother Adam said listen he said the whole world out there is about one degree from Total and Sandy right so what does that mean that means the spirit of fear is so rampant see it's so prominent right that uh that uh that men's hearts and the end time just be feeling better for fear that's right but now that's not the uh that's not a word to the bride there now that's that's it he's not talking about the bride Hearts you know failing and so forth like this so here's here's what I present to you today brother sister and Justin away Justice maybe just a pastoral challenge if you've got fear in your heart fear in your mind in your life I want you to know that God didn't put it there right yeah exactly God didn't give you that and God doesn't intend you to have that or live with that right but he does offer you deliverance from it right right amen all right give you accept it that's right you believe that now keep in mind again the greatest battle ever been fought is still rages in the human mind and fear is a very definite product of the mind so there's two very real forces here this morning striving for control of your mind right amen no wonder Jesus said men's Hearts failing for fear and looking after those things which are coming on the earth we talk about those things last night I would imagine so if an unbeliever was here and we just kind of kind of listed it'd be you know well where can I hide where can I go what can I do there's got to be a provision and there is a provision and that's what we were that's what you call it right I swept the prophet of God there is a provision there is a provision and so uh he said those things are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken right now let me know it's really been an hour right all right remember Paul's teaching on that several years later on the subject he said in Hebrews 12 26 6 whose voice then shook the Earth talking about Moses in the first Exodus his voice shook the Earth and now he's promised saying yet once more I'll shake not only the Earth this will be in the Third Exodus I'll shake not a listen if the voice of Moses shook the Earth I'm telling the prophet of God takes the message around the world seven times and says the world again is falling apart there's a voice in the land that's seeking the Earth amen but he says not only that now he's not going to shake heaven also and this word this expression Paul says yet what's more this expression he said this once more it signifies the removing of those things that are seeking as the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain I mean those it's a shaking time that's right we're in a shaking time right I remember where is it uh I believe Psalms 50 when David says our God talking about our God is here he said Our God told us him and he said it would still be very tempestuous round about it it'll be very stormy say well I'm in The Loving Arms of Jesus that's true but on the other side it's very tempestuous around about it you remember in Mark chapter 4 the disciples got in the boat with Jesus he had finished preaching the evening had come he said now it's time to pass over to the other side I love that when evening time has come the breaking of the day said it's time to pass over the other side all right Jesus is speaking something to him so they get in the boat with him and then what happened brother bam testimony on the seat said every day with every devil in hell swore that they were gonna gonna drown at those disciples save that boat that night right what what would they have said it's very tempestuous round about him very stormy about it and so that's what we're promised to shaking time right and hear the word shaking means this to cast down from your secure and happy state to overthrow to move to agitate the minds what they're shaking is talking about they're shaking I'll shake everything it means to agitate the mind so they shaken up not a physical shaking out there in buildings moving and so where that'll be here in due time there's an earthquake still on the tell them the docket here still on the calendar right to come but he's talking about the agitation of the mind that needs to disturb so it's only those things that only the only those that cannot be shaken or agitated in the mind see those that are not living under the spirit of fear but have taken the spirit of love and power and of a sound mind see and the only way to withstand is shaking now this greatest battle the only way to come out Victorious is to make sure I've got a sound mind by the word of the Lord now Paul wrote to the Thessalonians he said that he said I would that you be not soon shaken in mind right right or be troubled neither my spirit nor by word nor my letter is from us as the day of Christ is at hand right amen now various versions of the Bible interpret the verse this way uh not to allow your minds to be quickly unsettled or disturbed or kept exiled or alarmed do not let your minds be easily upset do not be troubled by a spirit so we've got sufficient warning here in the scripture don't let a spirit of fear trouble you don't let it shake you don't let it agitate your mind now which bird is he talking about that's going to agitate and disturb your mind well it's the spirit of fear right and that's the spirit that troubles your mind see the spirit of fear so why then are we so troubled by fear right why are we trouble by fear we fear something simply because we don't understand it all right we call that the fear of the unknown ever heard that expression see what's going to happen tomorrow yeah what's going to happen down the road what's going to happen next week what's going to happen to squeeze coming I'm seeing that's the reason we deal you know business we deal with those things and take that fear off of it that's right she's old now I see oh now I understand now I Got Confidence see now I got I got peace in my heart see what I'm saying see so the fear of the unknown what's going to happen what's going to happen next year what's going to happen to my family what's gonna happen to my business what's going to happen in my marriage what's gonna happen to my retirement my future what is it fear of the unknown right then we fear other things because of certain bad experiences that we have right see a dog let me see now I'm afraid of dogs I read of a plane crash and I'm afraid to fly somebody threw me into the pool when I was a child so now I'm afraid of the water my parents divorced when I was when I was a young person so now I'm afraid of marriage and I'm afraid of commitment I was in a car wreck so now I'm afraid to drive you see that and on and on the list could go but I think you get the point these kinds of things brother sister things that just happen in life calamities and misfortunes and and and setbacks and tragedies and overall bad experiences in life will undoubtedly contribute now to certain phobias and complexes that we may we may have here today that if we were to dig deep enough you could actually get to the root of and discover its origin you could do that matter of fact there's a whole scientific field devoted to that very purpose they call them shrinks Psychiatry and psychologists and psychoanalysis and and behavioral psychologists why why is it such a booming feel because so many struggle with fears and follow me and then we're afraid that other times because we just we lack control we feel helpless and even though we've been given scriptural authority over principalities and powers and darkness and over disease and the unknown sometimes we just feel helpless but what I'm saying to you is this that fear is very much a part of our Lives perhaps in some areas just way too much a part of our Lives because look considering the economy as it is now you might be afraid of losing your job or your health or losing your finances or losing your retirement losing your Investments maybe you're afraid of uh if you're afraid of rejection and not being accepted by others or maybe you're just afraid of growing old or maybe of disease or of terrorism or maybe of natural catastrophes of plagues and sweeping the Earth all of us got have got things that caused us to experience the emotion that we call fear are you with me and as a result in many cases we try to take precautions to protect ourselves don't we right we buy insurance policies to cover those things we consider valuable like our families in our material accumulations we put bars on our windows and our doors we buy security alarm systems to protect our automobiles in our homes all this because of what fear right researchers at John Hopkins University reported that 30 years ago the greatest fears of great school children were these the greatest fear was animals the second fear was being in a dark room the third fear as they rank in order high places the fourth fear strangers and the last was loud noises now you know what the top top five things that kids are scared of today not one of those 30 years ago fears uh month of the kids today the top five things kids are scared of number one divorce number two nuclear war number three cancer number four pollution and number five being mugged or kidnapped it said that the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin so feared for his safety that his residence in Moscow contained eight bedrooms each night's stolen chose a different bedroom at random to ensure that no one knew exactly where he was sleeping you know why he did this you know what motivated to do this fear during World War II military Governor met with General George Patton and Sicily when he praised Patton highly for his courage and bravery the general replied sir I'm not a brave man the truth is I'm an utter Craven coward I've never been within the sound of gunshot or in the sight of battle in my whole life that I wasn't so scared that I had sweat in the palms of my hands years later when Patton's autobiography was published it contained this very significant statement by the general I learned very early in life never to take counsel of my fears yeah right let me give you two definitions number one something is perceived as real a real tangible experience for the humans that experience them the origin of which you do not perceive that you're in control of fear does not occur I'm sorry fear does occur the most uh for the most for most humans you simply wait for the precise circumstances to appear you wait for the mugger you wait for the rejection you wait for the disease to establish itself in your body often motivational speaker Zig Ziglar says it like this fear f-e-a-r false evidence appearing real second and I like this definition the best fear is a creation of the human mind right that's right did you create it right here in your mind your career and it only exists for the reason you allow it to exist so you have control over this if you allow fear into existence then there is the provability that you are capable for you to determine not to exist to determine for it not to exist I should say what I'm saying to you this morning brother sister as that whether our fears are the result of something unknown or the result of sin or the result of learned behaviors or the result of bad experiences we need to face them right at some point in time we've got to confront our fears listen to me we've got to confront our fears and expose them for what they really are because when we expose them identify them and expose them guess what we can be delivered up right but not until then all right man Charles Allen writes in his book entitled victory in the valleys he writes five-year-old Johnny was in the kitchen as his mother made supper she asked him to go into the pantry and get her a can of tomato soup but he didn't want to go in alone it's dark in there and I'm scared she asked again and he persisted finally she said it's okay son Jesus will be in there with you Johnny walked hesitantly to the door and he slowly opened it he peeked inside and he saw it was dark he started to leave then all at once an idea came to him and he said Jesus if you're in there would you hand me that can of tomato soup so first we got to identify our fears the next thing we've got to do is overcome these fears to eliminate them deliverance from them listen to me lest they seize control and paralyze Us in certain areas in our lives you say it can't happen well you never convinced Joe with that because he said it did happen right Joe 3 and 25 he said for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me right you read that amen and that in that which I was afraid of is come unto me I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble came why did trouble come right right he created something in his life why did trouble come because of his fears right according to job he tells us that fear actually became a creative Force that brought the problem to him right the things that he feared why'd you say the thing I greatly for did not go about this little concern don't worry about something but he greatly feared It Came Upon him right and that which I was afraid of is come unto me the new life version says what I was afraid of has come unto me what filled me with fear has happened the Christian Standard Version said for the thing I feared has overtaken me and what I dreaded has happened to me the Contemporary English version said in my worst fears have all come true all right yep listen to how brother Brown let me go to the prophet's message listen to how he answers this one question in August of 1964. are you listening to this morning the question was asked him and I this is question 389 it's on page 11 59 qld book two when a person realizes that he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this somebody's concerned about it asking the prophet of God now the person who's asking this question number one recognizes he or she whoever was has a complex right they recognize it right now what's a complex it's an exaggerated or obsessive concern or fear so they were they were concerned about the spirit now a psychoanalyst would tell us that a complex is a combination of emotions and impulses that have been rejected from awareness but still influence a person's Behavior you don't know why you do a certain thing right and he said if you've rejected the awareness of that but something deep seated caused you to be fear about this fearful about that and you think why why am I why am I concerned Why am I fearful about that you see how subtle a complex can be sometimes you're not even aware you have it right because it has been rejected from awareness but still influences a person's Behavior amen all right so this person firstly recognizes I've got a complex and number two he wants to do something about it right huh he wants to overcome it he's tired of it he's tired of this fear this complex controlling his life anymore he wants to overcome this thing he doesn't want to live with it anymore he's tired of it right now watch brother Madam's answer here he doesn't just suggest well just learn to live with it just accept it just tolerate it he doesn't tell him there's nothing you can do about it just don't forget about it that's not what he tells him he doesn't tell this believer well go find a good treat he'll help you out that's not what he says because he knows what Paul wrote to Timothy concerning the spirit of fear he knows that Satan put fear on that person and he knows that God wants to deliver him of it and this is how he answers the person right brother Madam says uh take exactly the opposite yeah you're pretty simple he said turn right back around and give everything you got the other way right yeah if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got so Brothers identifying selfishness as a complex he said you want to break through with that break free of that thing start giving away what you got do whatever just go the vice versa you know what that means just the other way all right see just flip it around that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote continue to the next verse again he says take on the next uh paragraph he says take the very vice versa from it now we know the promise in this age is to the Overcomer right praise God we have to overcome we've seen it we testify we we overcome all right now let me ask you a question if we're not careful we'll we'll limit what what we consider to be overcoming uh to you know just include our own little definition of it oh yeah we'll confess well I've overcome the Odyssey I'll come out of Babylon I've overcome this little besetting sin uh I've overcome the Antichrist system and I to that I would say amen amen amen that's a good start right but where do you want to draw the line right yeah where do you want to stop is that all there is to it is there anything else see you search your own soul and ask yourself this morning see don't you want don't you want here's my question to you don't you want to overcome everything the devil puts on you right amen I don't think we have to accept anything the devil puts off to you amen or tries to I should say it like that see I've overcome my sins I'm overcome my temper I've overcome my anger my lust my Envy my quick tongue my laziness my mouth as well my greed and that might be your confession and I would say what was that all yeah is there more I'll ask you again where do you draw the line where do you want to stop overcoming how about your fingers can we include that I think we should all right man overcome means to defeat another in competition or conflict needs to Prevail over to conquer and and Triumph over the opposition to be victorious to render powerless over the victory it means to deal with successfully right deal with the issues of Life successfully that's it now what now what is it what is it then what what what is it to overcome see what is overcome so it does it include fear yeah can I overcome these fears that I have yeah right so what's the prophets advice here to this brother sister disregard your fears refuse to face them ignore them right uh let them dictate the direction of your life will take throw your hands up and discuss and they're not exactly he says he says he says he says you want to overcome these things he said just take the opposite right see are you afraid of water today you need to go put on your water wings and jump in the lake you afraid of heights you need to plan your trip to Pike's Peak you scared of flying you need to get on an airplane you scared of spiders you're gonna run up step on one right you're a lot bigger than he is right what's brother man I'm telling us he's telling us that your fears will control you right if you don't control them overcome them amen and we've all got some sort of fear or fears that we have to overcome but and here's the catch you've got to be willing to overcome your fears and that's where a whole lot of people married to the lamb page 11 Phoenix 1962 brother said if you'll notice he's quoting Revelation 19 11 and 12. he said she has made herself ready so many says that the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from life or from stealing then I'll serve him he said but that's up to you yeah you got something you got something too exactly see and we I mean we've just I don't know maybe just been taught Through The Years God delivered me this God deliver me that God brother and trust me I says no that's something you've got to do that's part of that process making yourself ready that's right he said something you got to do right they that overcome shall inherit all things see he says he said you can't he said God can't push you down a four inch pipe pull you out the other hand but set you up on your feet and say bless it he's overcome said he had nothing overcome right amen so you got to do they that are going to inherit all things they that overcome equation now watch this you've got power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down there it is right I'd be willing to be delivered got to be willing to control it got to be willing to to confront this thing right how about laying down your fears she's made herself ready he goes I like that word Dr Martin Lloyd Jones recognized by many have been one of the finest British preachers of the 20th century he was a minister of Westminster Chapel in London from 1938 to 1968. and he made this statement he said when a man is defeated by life it's always due ultimately to the fact that he's suffering from a spirit of fear the spirit of fear is the real the ultimate cause of all failure in life and of all unhappiness that's right spirit of fear the culprit the culprit that's right of all figuring life and happiness quite a statement in the message show us the father it'll satisfy brother Madam said you must be willing to whatever it is lay it aside every weight that nothing easily beset you and run the race with patience now he's quoting the Apostle Paul in Hebrews 12 and 1. where Paul is dealing with the believer's besetting sins and he only mentions them one time in all of his letters Paul does and beset beset when Paul calls him besetting sins it means to attack from all sides sins that trouble persistently to harass to him and her surround now Paula said these are the things that we want to address identify address and be willing to overcome all right now let me ask you let me ask you a a a question did Brother about a preach a sermon entitled a total Deliverance anybody ever read it what do you think you might be talking about right in total Deliverance right what was his message in that sermon he said God wants to bring you to a total deliverance from everything that's got you Shackled everything that's got you bound and fettered God wants to bring it delivers right you know what Deliverance is is literally the rescue from Bond ordained or danger yeah I suspect some of us here today perhaps need to be be delivered from the bondage of of a fear in some way because fear is not a believer's natural response to that thing the confront you it's a spirit that Satan has put on you and the prophet of God tells us that God wants you and I to be delivered can you say Amen convinced then concerned Chicago 62. he said we must be willing and open to receive God and whatever God's got for us with an open heart we must receive it all right whatever is God's got we must receive it all right now if God's promised a total Deliverance where do we stand if we come short of it all right right now right right total you know what it means it means complete it means absolute it means including everything without conditions or limitations is complete in extent or degree and in every particular let me read your statement from that same message brother bam said I was thinking on this subject a total Deliverance the church has been in the minority it always will be in members until Jesus comes but it's living under its god-given privileges if we only knew this is the Church of the Living God he goes on down to paragraph 77 he says now for hearts condemn us we want complete deliverance right and we won't complete the lyrics we don't want to be halfway church we want to be a real church or no church at all we don't we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all we want Total deliverance from our habits from our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence whatever we've done we want Total Deliverance always hit home this morning brother sister he goes on down paragraph 92 all Jesus Works was complete everything was complete totally delivered he totally delivered the leper from leprosy totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died the day of the atonement totally delivered every sin he delivered the church there's no need for us to live underprivileged people right memory you hear what he says there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and Powers subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you not even a spirit of fear right all right see he said we're Christians we're filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have to have the devil dictate to us through What Fear right Christ delivered us total lyrics delivered us from evil delivered from sin Deliver Us from Habits delivers from talking right amen and I don't think he just means you know you don't got talking he's talking about talking about gossiping you know rumor bearing things like that he delivered us from all that stuff right delivered from black garden I have no idea what Black Guard is maybe some of you Southerners can fill me in on that but he says we know there's some Black Guard uh delivers from all kinds of smutty things he totally delivered us and put us into his holy heads a complete total lyrics The Devil is defeated he said we won't Deliver Us amen can you say we won't deliver it he goes on to say he's praying now in paragraph 98 he says Dear God we know you don't take things unless it's totally delivered wow wow how about the bride all right well he take us on a Rapture if we're filled with fears and worries and doubts and insecurities let me read again he said Lord God you don't take things unless it's totally delivered you cannot receive a sacrifice for the blemish owner for we want a complete and total deliverance from everything Lord that would keep us from being the light of the world a candle that set on a hill not a bushel over it but a candle's out on a hill that gives light to God people's feet in the way that's right granted father great Glory yes listen to David's prayer in the 34th song The psalmist David the man who was after God's Own Heart amen David said I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears David what'd you beseech the Lord for talk about secret Lord signature it was for a specific command all right thank you I got some fears here I'm not going to leave with I'm not going to be holding shackle about by all these fears can't do this keep doing that because I've created something in my mind I'm praying this phrase this idea see what I'm saying so David said man after God's Own Heart I assault the Lord he heard me and delivered me from all my fears and God is not a respective person so if God can do that for David in the Old Testament he can do it for you today that's right and do it for me today if if if if you're wanting to be delivered if you're willing to be delivered right you got to ask yourself am I willing to that's right you take your control the truth is he can deliver you from fear from the bondage of your brother sister only if you're willing to be delivered if you're happy with your fears and accepting of your fears and willing to let and willing to let them control your life well I would feel sorry for you but that's your decision that's your choice amen David said I sought the Lord for what Deliverance of his fears amen David said I've got fears I've got phobias I've identified my life and they're controlling me they're holding me in bondage and check he absolutely knew the same thing Paul knew that God has not given me these fears and he reveals to us those writings and he wants to confront these fears and he wants to receive calling the lyrics from these spirits and God said I'll do it and he did it amen amen thank you Lord man sooner or later brother sister we don't have to deal with this picture here right yeah right you may know where I was going here first John 4 17 18. and we're going to have to do something with it we're going to have to look at this and do something with it watch what happens in the hour when perfect love comes on the scene first John 4 17 here it is our love made perfect God perfected his love now right that we may have boldness now amen which is courage it's Assurance in the day of judgment because as he not was or will be but as he is right so are we in this world so it's identify what he uses as he is so are we same word speak to the green speech of the Bride amen right amen identify myself a part of it the word for boldness there is parhesia and it means fear I'm sorry free and fearless confidence cheerful courage assurance first John 4 18. John likes this there is no fear in love right but perfect love all right wow all right amen what's the effect what's what's perfect love gonna do well it's gonna cast out your feedback if you're willing if you'll let it right amen perfect love Dustin Stay With Me cast out fear amen all right now I've got a question for you if fear wasn't going to be an issue for the ride of this end time why then does the Holy Spirit bring this to our attention at this time and Associate it with this perfect love that is to be present and manifested in this hour in the lives of his people right amen I'll tell you what because John who is a type of a bride knew that this would be the day and the hour that the spirit of fear would have to be personally identified and confronted and dealt with and delivered from right so two things we're told the perfect love will do number one it will create in us a Fearless hi mother said if you got they said if you know your position you know you're standing the word he said you can be Fearless he said you can tell anybody everybody it don't matter what anybody says anybody does you can stand alone not even just like the lives of the rest of them just stand alone it doesn't matter because you've got a revelation this word right yes that's right didn't Jesus say in John didn't Jesus say that in John 8 32 he said you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free a lot of times we call it set you free but it's different except free and make free right he'll make you free make you free John's telling us that fear and perfect love cannot coexist and once the closer you get the Capstone the further you're going to get from theater right the more delivered you you uh you are from fear that you actually become right amen so in the word now this cleansing purging perfecting uh element of the word is going to make you free now the word here make means deliver or said it Liberty come on the world will deliver you the word will set you in Liberty in other words this word this Revelation this message will deliver you and liberate you from all these fears that Satan has uh just loaned you for a while right so Jesus is saying as you get to know me as you learn to think the way I want you to think as you begin to live a life worthy of the Gospel the way that I want you to live as you learn the truth then you will be not just set free but made free from fear from sin from the uncertainties of Life why because perfect love casts out fear when Jesus was asked about the greatest commandment he answered without hesitation he said love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all of your strength is that what he said now what happens if I truly love God with all my body and my mind and my emotions that means I'll no longer be afraid of what could affect me physically exactly Jesus said fear not what men can do it right but you better fear Him who can actually take the body and soul and throw you in the Lake of Fire amen so I'm no longer them to be afraid of what can afflict me physically I no longer need to be afraid of mental anxieties I no longer need to be afraid of emotional insecurities and uncertainties why because perfect love right perfect love Christ The Headstone is here and perfect love cast out fear all right amen listen if your security depends on your bank account it depends on your Visa and Mastercards it depends on your good health on your own good relationships with family friends and church members we're doomed to failure right right I'll tell you right now the only secure relationship we can have is in Christ Jesus the word right amen all right because he is the element He is The Source by which perfect love casts up here right that's right the message translation says this there is no room in love for fear well-formed love banishes fear a New Living Translation says it expels Fear The Net Bible says it drives out fear since fear is crippling a fearful life fear of death fear of judgment is one not yet fully formed in love wow that's something right we're talking about getting interaction conditions what we're talking about exactly does that sound like a Rapture Runner believer filled with fears and phobias and doubts and worries and insecurities and affordables and things like that I don't think so that's right but first we need to expose our fears then we need to eliminate overcome our fears because Verse 18 watch Fear half torment amen you know what that is you know what torment is is Middle anguish Middle English and sometimes it even refers to it refers to great great physical pain see not testifying of his gifts Hammond Indiana 1952 Alabama said so don't fear fear is of the devil Everything Jesus would say fear not fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not if you're not they're right always fear not and God don't want you to fear all right he wants you to believe right so every one of you believe in one Accord one Accord every one of you amen God made a way for us in Jeffersonville 52 he said and through the services this week trying to show people that there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear if you're willing to live with the worst thing the devil can put on you I don't know I'm just talking about risk hold my if I was at home I'd say something like I'm ashamed of it but I'm not home so I can say that yeah go ahead I think better though you know what I'm saying all right brother yeah right the worst thing the devil can't put on you is I hear all right he said even if you had cancer didn't fear and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad of shape right God take care of that if you were sick whatever it is and if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place Upon Us I've had a little publication here excuse me an old publication call today in the word you may have heard of it I was all started today published back in August of 1992. and it was about it was about a fella called black Bart ever heard of black Bart he was a professional Thief whose very name struck fear as he terrorized the Wells Fargo Stage Line from San Francisco to New to New York his name became synonymous with the danger of the frontier between 1875 and 1883 which is about eight years he robbed 29 different Stagecoach Crews amazingly Bart did all of this without firing the shot because a hood hit his face no victim ever saw his face he never took a hostage and was never trailed by a sheriff instead black bark used fear to paralyze his victims his Sinister presence was enough to overwhelm the toughest Stagecoach guard yeah think of that boy old Blackboard just use fear to paralyze his victims yeah I wonder where his inspiration came from using fear to paralyze his victims no wonder brother baham said fear is one of the worst things that's taking place upon his trash right place upon a person man right there was a lady who died in 1916 whose name was Eddie green she was called America's greatest Miser when she died in 1916 she left an S an estate valued at a hundred million dollars 1916 now that's probably half a billion dollars now or more valued a hundred million but she was so miserly that she ate cold oatmeal in order to save the expense of heating the water oh my god when her son had a severe leg injury she took so long trying to find a free clinic to treat him that his leg had to be amputated because of Advanced infection no money you got a hundred million dollars and you're so miserly you won't even turn the stove on to heat up would you say there was a spirit of fear had something to do with that would you say she was shackle she was paralyzed absolutely what was her fear what was the phobia she was worried about losing her wealth so she didn't even enjoy her life at all right I don't think any of us you'd probably have anything to worry about but just in case you're a stockpiling millions of dollars and depriving yourself and others I'm not saying throw caution to the wind and uh you know forget about retirement planning and such program said you know just go ahead you don't just keep telling the roofing things like that keep on doing it right but if you're stockpiling Untold Fortune for 50 years from now forget it the Catholic church is really going to love you brother sister because we don't like you they're going to be your beneficiary all right brother Brown tell us about a woman they're not closing here just a minute let me all right because it just doesn't matter so robot in the message Faith cometh by hearing Chicago 1954. he said well the woman had been in the insane Institution for years he said many of you knows Romaine redigar was the same thing she was brought down the house here she was delivered right there the Lord Jesus healed her right there she's the mother of two children now that was Mother Romaine he says he continues only says so the other lady who's been in the institution many I believe I'm not mistaken it was 10 years she had a phobia all right now phobia I read a bunch of all these hobies now this one put it in the insane Institution for 10 years now the other one came obviously in this dude brother man prayed for the spirit left and she was able to look have a nice a piece of life children and everything else brother man said it was 10 years she had a phobia when she'd get in the room they'd turn her loose she'd run Jump Through the Windows like that she jumped out of a two-story window almost taken her life yeah what did that fear phobia because she didn't deal with it right huh maybe she didn't know how right we're more privileged today because we do know how to deal with it right nms is Prophet Elijah Chicago 54. brother Adam said Jesus Christ that come along and delivered the man in gadera is here tonight to deliver you from this and take that phobia from you listen here's your prophet of God he said the Lord Jesus is here to deliver you and take that phobia from you and drive the devil from you that you can return to your home well he said do you believe that do you believe these that he sent me here to do this for you all right I'm telling you brother sister the prophet of God was dead serious about the people needing to get delivered from their fears and their phobias he absolutely saw what he was doing to people Dawson Creek British Columbia from that time you'll remember this what's the matter Soldier Boy remember that you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy you've only got a phobia right now this boy's phobia was causing him to consider suicide say something you want to play around with no that's just a little dude he said he's lying to the devil's lying too he will drive you insane if you believe him deny him renounce the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ for announce the devil except Jesus Christ you're a Healer you'll go back and be a gentleman a real real man you know what he's talking about right because the boy would say uh he was homosexual right he says do you sin raise up your hands uh to God and say praise God that's right and I go home and be well now you're remembering brother biscoll's testimony tape that he was with brother Adam a few days later and they ran into that young boy the little diner and they talked with him and the boy had received his Deliverance he didn't go commit his uh um uh suicide thank you yeah he was uh and he was delivered so here's the danger and I'm closing now the musicians uh may come I understand number one I want you to understand this if you take notes write this down fear is a curse there's a curse listen to me brother sister if you're living in fear today you're living in an emotional prison right you're living Behind Bars more powerful than steel fear I want you to know is a destructive force it destroys abilities and dreams it'll destroy potentials and gifts and talents that you might have fear has destroyed homes and marriages and family relationships is destroyed health and in fact fear will kill you may prove they will right doctors Maryland Cleveland of Cleveland and Charles S Hirsch of Cincinnati concluded that acute stress can provoke changes in the heart that may lead to death the two doctors recently identified 15 cases in which people died after a physical assault although the injuries alone would not have been enough to kill him 11 of the 15 cases showed a type of heart cell death called myofibrillar degeneration similar to a reaction in experimental animals who are helpless to anticipate or avoid Danger I'd rather have a fella not long ago who got locked in a refrigerator truck you know what those are those 18 wheelers the refrigerated trucks and the next morning they opened the door they found the boy dead he froze into death but they found there was a little problem there the refrigerator unit was not even on the temperature was not over 50 degrees but you know what happened this boy was so convinced that he was going to freeze to death his fear now just like job it it come upon him and it brought about his death in other words his fear controlled his mind and his body completely shut down the boy died said because he created this thing in his mind that was not even real right right that's a shame in it right all right another man said this kind of fears of the devil right so the devil controls fear and because the devil is a liar he'll never present fear to you as fear right because fear always masquerades as something else right sure right you know well that's just not my I just don't like you said see you know it's timidness sometimes uh he'll expose itself as a lack of confidence perhaps even procrastination quirky Behavior Ultra cautious Behavior insecurity in many different ways all right there's a number of ways that fear impersonates what we would call acceptable behavior and only because we refuse to acknowledge that there is a fear or fears in my life you know what we do we just simply learned to live with it yeah yeah I was going to live with it to form my life around this thing and instead of confronting them and dealing with them scripturally by letting this perfect love headstone that's available to us drive it out and expel every fear that torments us at different times in our lives see that's what that's the challenge that's the four of us today right I understand brother sister it was both the mission and the message of Jesus Christ to deliver Mankind from the slavery of fear that's why the two words Jesus used most in his Earthly Ministry were these fear not right right fear not life because I'm the way the truth and the life fear not death we did it earlier that living was dead in the ball of my life forevermore and have the keys of death and hell right fear not the unknown he said I'm Alpha I'm Omega the beginning the ending saith the Lord that which was which is which is to come the almighty right 63 times in the Bible we're told to fear not amen fear not Martin Luther made an interesting observation in his little magazine called table talk he said God and the devil take opposite tactics in regard to fear the lord first allows us to become afraid that he might relieve our fears and comfort us the devil on the other hand first makes us feel secure in our pride in our sins that we might later be overwhelmed with fear and despair then we could go on and on and on and on talking about the phobias and things like that but understand listen fear is absolutely harmful fear will paralyze us it'll keep us from doing things that we should do or even want to do how many times you want to do something but fear kept you from it right well I'd like to go out on a boat with everybody but you know I understand there will be water there won't they you'd love to go but I can't because I've got a fear that I haven't been delivered of that I need to be delivered up that I can be delivered because God wants me to be amen that's right perhaps the preaching of this message today brother sister has reminded you of some fear that might torment you in your life of fear that you need to overcome and Conquer your day right see and understand I'm closing with this come fear it's not a matter of self-determination well I'm just going to turn to be a better person I mean it it's a matter of total dependence on The God Who has called us in redeemed Us by his Amazing Grace right it's a matter of belief in the words of Jesus Christ and his promises to you it's a matter of recognizing the devil's pitiful attempts to you and paralyze you with fear and God's Majestic Grace in giving you power and love and a sound mind amen Paul said Philippians 4 30 I can do all things through him who gives me strength right right you believe that amen now your hands will be a word of prayer heavenly father I offer prayer this morning for those Among Us who may be imprisoned and held hostage by some form of fear we understand it's not your will or that we should live in this tournament but these weeks should be adorned in the same sound Righteous Mind of Christ Our husband may we recognize Lord that this is your will to heal us and Deliver Us from these crippling fears and phobias as you desire us to experience total freedom and liberty in Jesus Christ I'll always many others here today offer my life to you Lord on the altar of sacrifice I'm going to confront my fears o God and allow this perfect love through the means of the perfect work to invade these fearful darkened areas of my life that I've lived with for so many years and to be totally set free from the bondage of these fears I accept it we accept it we receive it lord it's your promise it's your guarantee to us that as your elected children may you even now dear God begin to break the chains and the feathers of the spirit of fear that might exist will not be subject to this Incarnation any longer Lord but will claim our total Deliverance amen begin on God to work in us now oh holy spirit let your cleansing delivering power amen may it work in us and we might be Rapture Ready in the hour that she called us home I claimed victory for every son every daughter of God here today verse in the name of our redeeming Savior and our husband the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen stand your feet with me see the little course you're seeing here we've been made more than conquerors right Overcomers in this life we've been made Victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Amen brother I don't know what key it's in but just give me some key um foreign he lives amen amen I can live also Lester singing Glory amen yes I know the year has told me severeign yeah you see all you gotta do is lay it on the Altar and bravely I always had a fear when he'll be traveling because I hadn't been that way before and I prayed and Lord took that away because we have a little dispatcher problem and one day I was going down the road and they said you know I said look along the way here and said these houses everywhere down this road and said this Road's going somewhere so that means somebody put it there yeah you know I've never had that fear anymore he delivered me from that fear just by telling me to look along the road because I had the fear but now you're thinking about driving on the highway somebody flipped her yeah so it had to go somewhere yeah but see you say well I don't have fear that Wellness you know everybody's got some kind of fear but all you got to do is put it under the blood right that's it man that's it that's right give it to the Lord let him take away that fear and then you find out that 99 of the things never come to pass right that you're afraid of right and it's been all day in your mind contemplating you know and you find it never takes place and that's just a figure that's a phobia in your dimensions foreign because that way if there's any problem with yourself a problem right there's no trouble and I didn't have any problems with
