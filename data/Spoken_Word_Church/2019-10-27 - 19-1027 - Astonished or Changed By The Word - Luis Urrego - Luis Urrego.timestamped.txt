[0:00] you know we all want to be filled with
[0:02] God right yeah you know we sing those
[0:05] some more and more of you I've had it
[0:08] all but what I need is more of you I
[0:11] heard something one time said I want to
[0:13] be filled with God so much that when a
[0:18] mosquito bites me he goes out and says
[0:22] there was power and I believe that's the
[0:36] desire everyone was not satisfied with
[0:40] one one one experience with God but I
[0:46] believe there's multiple experiences
[0:48] multiple refilling of the Holy Spirit
[0:51] every time the word opens to you every
[0:54] time you receive a revelation from the
[0:55] word that's sort of that's a revival see
[0:59] and you shouldn't take that lightly and
[1:03] now the thing is just getting it from
[1:05] here
[1:06] button in here so that it can come into
[1:09] action all right and that's what we
[1:10] desire so you want to
[1:12] act on the word and not just have it as
[1:15] information because you know this
[1:19] scripture right here that there that we
[1:22] read in John chapter of John chapter 1
[1:27] verse 22 this is when when the Pharisees
[1:33] and they came to John and said and they
[1:38] were asking him this if you start thus
[1:40] there verse 19 assists and this is the
[1:43] record of John when the Jews sent
[1:45] priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
[1:47] ask him who art thou and he confessed
[1:51] and did not not but confessed I am NOT
[1:54] the Christ and they asked him what then
[1:58] art thou Elias and he said I am NOT
[2:01] although that prophet and the answer no
[2:04] then said they unto Him who art thou but
[2:08] now watch the reason why you are asking
[2:10] they said this is the reason why they
[2:12] were asking that we may give an answer
[2:14] to them that sent us what say is dialed
[2:18] I said now take that right there and you
[2:24] see what the purpose that they were
[2:25] asking me who who are you
[2:27] they weren't asking for because they
[2:32] wanted to be a Muslim
[2:33] think what they wanted to repent they
[2:35] wanted to know they were asking because
[2:38] they wanted some information to take
[2:42] back to the but now you go you go and
[2:45] look at what happened for example with
[2:47] Paul at that time you saw when he was
[2:50] growing too
[2:51] and on the road to Damascus and the Lord
[2:54] appeared to him you know the scripture
[2:56] I'm talking about
[2:59] he asked the exact same question he said
[3:03] who art thou Lord see one question the
[3:09] same question one Brock was just for
[3:13] information and knowledge but the other
[3:15] one was for a transformation so you see
[3:18] sometimes sometimes we we might be uh we
[3:24] ask many questions or we might have that
[3:26] that might sit well this is just
[3:28] information you know this is just
[3:30] knowledge but it's got to be more than
[3:32] that he's got to be for temple cuz Paul
[3:35] from that day forward was not the same
[3:37] so he knew that when that when that
[3:40] light shone on him this is he said Lord
[3:45] who art thou he knew that that was that
[3:48] without what that wasn't from a man that
[3:50] was God no no it's got on the scene and
[3:53] from then on his name changed and this
[3:56] is life change and then on so you know
[3:59] in this world that we live in you know
[4:01] where we are so we're so getting used to
[4:04] you know google eyes the answers when
[4:09] you have we asked google things and we
[4:11] get the answer quickly
[4:12] you know we're becoming very slow oh
[4:15] yeah because of those things
[4:18] technologies really exceed it's
[4:20] beneficial it's wonderful I think one of
[4:22] the greatest things for new for me at
[4:24] least as far as technology is concerned
[4:26] is GPS
[4:28] DPS and I think it's wonderful and
[4:32] hopefully Google with Google Maps and
[4:34] there were charges for their further
[4:35] service but yeah but I think it's it
[4:39] it's been so helpful but really if you
[4:41] think about it ice deliver pizzas for
[4:44] Papa John's and we didn't how do you
[4:47] have GPS back in the 90s yeah I would
[4:50] have to look at a map and remember their
[4:53] album and they not go and not get there
[4:56] and see now now we would punch it on the
[4:59] GPS
[5:00] and the GPS is doing all the work and
[5:02] back then my mind was doing the
[5:05] now that's
[5:06] cases of dementia a lot of things like
[5:09] that because people are not using their
[5:10] right in hi they're not adding no more
[5:13] wrinkles to their brain like I was
[5:14] talking about ago and then in that and
[5:17] that's that's that's that's why it's
[5:19] good you know we get involved with
[5:20] things that kind of exercise the mind
[5:22] you know how the chest is one of my
[5:24] favorites so chess is great but but
[5:27] we're so used to these Google eyes
[5:29] dancers now but if you think about it
[5:31] you know God answers quickly there's
[5:33] verses in the Bible that says I will
[5:34] answer you know you call it to me and I
[5:36] will answer speedily you know a lot of
[5:39] that this is that just lets me know that
[5:42] he's the original Google he answer
[5:45] speedily maybe not at the timeframe that
[5:48] you think that he should answer me
[5:52] but but to him you know one day is a
[5:55] thousand years and a thousand years is
[5:57] one day to him you see so he's the one
[6:00] who gives us the word he said I will
[6:02] answer you click the Outlands to me
[6:03] quickly maybe not in your timeframe it
[6:06] could take five years six years ten
[6:08] years but to him that's quick because he
[6:11] knows exactly the time that you need
[6:13] that answer it can't be any anytime
[6:17] sooner bikini time later it's exactly at
[6:20] that moment and so that's why I call him
[6:23] the perfect Google
[6:27] he sees the answers quickly and he gives
[6:30] the exact answer so but you know
[6:34] sometimes by the word where we read that
[6:38] we either
[6:38] we're either a stop a lot of the work or
[6:41] where they're changed by the work you
[6:45] know there's there's there scriptures in
[6:47] the Bible for example in Luke chapter 2
[6:50] I'll go there real quick to nurse is 47
[7:11] Just Breathe I guess from verse 42
[7:13] assists and when he was 12 years old
[7:15] speaking of Jesus they went up to
[7:17] Jerusalem after the custom of the Beast
[7:19] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[7:21] they returned the Child Jesus tarried
[7:24] behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his
[7:27] mother knew not of it now you you think
[7:32] is your child PL you know it shouldn't
[7:37] be you looking out after your child but
[7:40] see they were so consumed and so
[7:41] concerned with because in fact then they
[7:45] have to travel you know and it was like
[7:48] they it was like whole families
[7:50] traveling and the reason why they would
[7:52] do it that way is because they could
[7:53] protect one another for my thieves that
[7:55] would come on the way and things like
[7:57] that so I'm sure there was a big caravan
[7:59] of people traveling and so yeah many
[8:02] little children that you weren't careful
[8:04] they could probably get loose and you
[8:07] not know where they where they're at so
[8:10] that was the case from here with Mary
[8:11] and Joseph and when they had fulfilled
[8:13] those days as they returned the Child
[8:14] Jesus tarried behind them through some
[8:16] and Joseph and his mother knew not of it
[8:18] but they supposing him to have been in
[8:22] the company you see they went a day's
[8:26] journey and they sought him among their
[8:29] kinsfolk and acquaintances you think
[8:33] about you've gone a day without your
[8:35] your your your child without that your
[8:40] lives are night but that's exactly what
[8:43] the Bible says they went a day's journey
[8:47] without Jesus being around them and I
[8:50] guess they were just so comfortable
[8:51] among their family kinfolks that you
[8:54] know what I don't have them something I
[8:56] you know my brother or my sister you
[8:57] know they must be watching them you know
[8:59] look they left Jesus behind
[9:02] know that he was and when they saw him
[9:07] the signal Mozart and it came to pass
[9:11] that after three days they found him in
[9:13] the temple so three days later they were
[9:19] looking for him right I'm sorry let this
[9:24] verse 45 I'm get ahead and when they
[9:26] found him now they turned back again to
[9:28] Jerusalem seek me now that they realize
[9:31] they lost him now they're looking for
[9:32] you and it's the same thing with the
[9:35] United States if we don't realize that
[9:37] we need and you don't seek him you're
[9:42] not gonna find
[9:44] that's what you said seek and you shall
[9:46] find you know not and it shall be opened
[9:52] unto you and I think sometimes we have a
[9:55] hard time believing that that when you
[9:58] go to prayer when you get down to pray
[10:00] you are you are a bomb
[10:06] you know before before God them and
[10:09] that's an explosion to them to the devil
[10:12] safe alert when you get down to prayer
[10:15] in sincerity not just not just in a
[10:19] ritual but in a sincere way Lord it's
[10:23] you and I'm and I have this need
[10:27] sometimes maybe we didn't even we don't
[10:29] even have to bring needs before you
[10:31] sometimes you get in a quiet place and
[10:33] just just listen and just kind of just
[10:37] meditate on him that brings him that
[10:40] brings him on the scene I don't know for
[10:43] me Saints but that just being personal
[10:45] with you over something what helps me
[10:47] enter in is I think I think of God
[10:51] now I know he's a Keenan right and I
[10:55] just feel like I'm coming before him and
[10:58] he's sitting on the throne he's sitting
[11:00] on the throne and I imagine the Hoffmans
[11:04] head of Christ see the way he's looking
[11:07] and he's looking at me concerned he's
[11:09] looking at me with a concern that that
[11:12] he's concerned about that he wants me to
[11:15] feel good he wants me to get me to meet
[11:18] my need and and so that kind of helps me
[11:22] enter intimacy so visualize them in that
[11:27] way of that if that will help you you
[11:29] know visualize them in those in those
[11:30] ways because it's good to enter into
[11:35] good sincere prayer but anyways here's
[11:37] Mary and Joseph and they lost and they
[11:39] lost him and so they go back to looking
[11:40] for him in that in verse 46 they came to
[11:43] pass that after three days they found
[11:45] him in the temple sitting in the middle
[11:47] of God in the midst of the doctors both
[11:49] hearing them and asking them questions
[11:51] now watch verse 47 and all that heard
[11:55] him Jesus now all that heard him were
[11:59] astonished at his understanding and
[12:01] answers but we never read where they
[12:06] were changed by his understandings and
[12:09] the answers people are astonished
[12:15] as powerful but nothing ever happens
[12:19] about that they never take action post
[12:21] innocency for whatever reason and when
[12:26] they saw him they were amazed and his
[12:29] mother had said unto him see they were
[12:31] amazed I think a lot of people sometimes
[12:33] they come they come to church and they
[12:37] remain and it's a lot it's a lot like
[12:40] that at the beginning when you don't
[12:41] have a real grounded word birth it's
[12:47] like that at the beginning it's Victor's
[12:50] baby it could be like that you have to
[12:52] be very careful to not just be
[12:54] astonished by the word or astonished by
[12:56] the revelation or astonished by the
[12:58] depth of the word man that's powerful
[13:02] but then you can go out and then we
[13:04] don't do anything about that that's
[13:07] that's why that's what kills us that's
[13:09] why it hurts us and so many times you
[13:12] know we've seen it
[13:14] here in this church we've seen it that
[13:15] people you see them fairly excited about
[13:18] the word seem very then some point later
[13:25] they're not hear anything so it's one
[13:28] thing to be astonished by the word and
[13:30] changed by the word I want to be changed
[13:33] see I want to be change it's okay at the
[13:39] beginning to be astonished and amazed I
[13:41] believe that's the human element of it
[13:43] because of Revelation think about it
[13:46] sings a revelation isn't something that
[13:47] just goes directly to your heart when
[13:50] you hear the word it doesn't just go
[13:52] directly to your heart you have to
[13:55] process it here first right you have to
[13:58] hear it here and then process it here
[14:00] the human element of it then it goes
[14:03] down to the heart but that's but that's
[14:06] if you continue in that word because not
[14:09] all the time not now right away
[14:10] God gives you a revelation sometimes you
[14:15] could hear maybe brother Dale saying
[14:16] something or a minister saying something
[14:18] and and you know that's the truth but
[14:22] now you know that's the truth you're not
[14:24] disputing it but it may not be till like
[14:28] two years later that you say oh my
[14:31] goodness that's exactly what I had heard
[14:34] that two years before Oh am i good and
[14:38] now that causes you to take action on
[14:40] that that's a revelation out there
[14:44] that's a revelation
[14:46] the best example I can give is water
[14:48] baptism
[14:49] Jesus Christ a lot of people out here
[14:52] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:55] but it's not a revelation to them I mean
[15:01] you can know water baptism in Lord Jesus
[15:03] Christ that's just information sometimes
[15:07] we get it confused with Revelation
[15:09] knowing but when you act on it and you
[15:12] know the purpose the reason why you're
[15:14] doing it that's the full revelation of
[15:17] it
[15:18] see the revelation of the word to you
[15:23] I believe it's uh it's it's taking the
[15:28] physical part of it but then acting on
[15:31] that as well praise God
[15:34] we got minutes let's go to Matthew
[15:40] chapter 7 Matthew chapter 7 I know
[15:44] everybody's tired and everybody had had
[15:49] the Fall Festival yesterday and
[15:51] everything but just hang on just hold up
[15:58] [Music]
[16:03] sneaks away see like I'm not sleek
[16:13] Matthew 7 Matthew 7 28 and 29 the Bible
[16:18] says here and it came to pass and it
[16:25] came to pass when Jesus had ended these
[16:27] sayings the people were astonished at
[16:29] his doctrine where he taught them as one
[16:34] having Authority and not as the scribes
[16:37] we don't here we don't read with that
[16:40] dr. changes them see
[16:42] but you see would you see that they were
[16:45] astonished look at that the word
[16:49] astonished amazed astonish in another
[16:58] place I was looking at last night gave
[17:00] something a different different though
[17:02] [Music]
[17:12] to stun or strike done with sudden fear
[17:15] terror surprise or wonder to amaze to
[17:20] confound with with some sudden passion
[17:23] daniel was astonished at the vision
[17:26] now we're Stunna shhhht that's wonderful
[17:29] that's app it's good now let's do
[17:30] something enough let's lift this because
[17:34] the word the word is not in need only or
[17:39] it word only Amen we just don't want it
[17:41] just we don't want it just information
[17:44] we want a transformation by that word
[17:52] two-strike without a fifth to strike
[17:54] with sudden and usually greater wonder
[17:56] surprise amen
[17:59] praise God and then another instance in
[18:03] Silicon John John 732 they said they
[18:08] said about then came the officers to the
[18:13] chief priests and Pharisees and they
[18:14] said unto them why have you brought him
[18:16] officers answered never a man spake like
[18:20] this man
[18:22] [Music]
[18:24] but that never takes them you see we
[18:29] don't see where those officers you know
[18:30] in that in that specific scripture they
[18:33] were changed that they follow Jesus they
[18:36] are they are they may be I don't know
[18:38] they were enough Illuminati did the word
[18:41] will cause you to act on on that work
[18:44] amen
[18:45] and that's what that's what we want to
[18:46] do is act act on the word grace go
[18:54] see Jesus for example the phrase Dow has
[18:59] the words of eternal life
[19:00] right Peter said those things where can
[19:06] we go
[19:07] you're the only one that has the words
[19:08] of eternal life but when Peter said that
[19:10] he wasn't born again you see isn't he he
[19:16] had it here and he knew that that was
[19:21] the Christ
[19:22] but really what sealed it for him was
[19:24] when he got the Holy Ghost in the upper
[19:26] room because what happened that that he
[19:30] received about him knowing the Christ
[19:32] caused him to act on the day of
[19:34] Pentecost he took action boldness came
[19:37] upon him and he started thinking the
[19:39] word and was building one word on top a
[19:41] word on top of word on top of word so
[19:43] it's a fight him to action when that
[19:46] really became a revelation now you're
[19:49] not just the Christ but you're my Lord
[19:51] Lord the Christ II see
[19:55] Jesus was recognizing his day not as a
[19:59] powerful speaker but as a speaker of
[20:02] powerful words sometimes sometimes uh
[20:08] you know we don't always need to have
[20:11] the whooping hollering that's one thing
[20:14] but pay attention to the words that are
[20:17] being spoken you know that's what brings
[20:20] power see
[20:25] amen so anybody have any comments or
[20:29] anything like that so let's just just a
[20:31] little thought you know wasn't anything
[20:32] big we're running out of time this is to
[20:35] be his stuff not just the astonished by
[20:37] the word but let's be changed by the
[20:39] word and there's other other examples
[20:41] you can
[20:48] [Music]
[20:55] right yes like when he was 12 years old
[20:58] talking to this you know you need the
[21:01] word now you know I think he was brother
[21:05] Brenda said it says something on the
[21:07] lines up
[21:08] he probably may not even know that he
[21:11] was saying those things Jesus at that
[21:14] age I mean you think of a 12 year old 10
[21:17] and you know you know fella she's 12
[21:19] years old you know I can see the her
[21:23] maturity level one sometimes they might
[21:24] say things they might mean you know what
[21:26] they're talking about in their mind they
[21:28] might think they do but but but
[21:31] sometimes you know but it was because he
[21:34] was the word see all of God was in him
[21:36] so it was that word speaking through so
[21:40] and I think that's a quote from brother
[21:42] Brandon I'm not mistake I heard it the
[21:45] other day
[21:47] any other comments or questions we've
[21:49] got like two more minutes
[21:53] so Thomas you need to change and the
[21:59] word to stop the minute go spin and end
[22:01] with a bass you know we're seeing I'm
[22:03] amazed all right let's do something
[22:06] about it I'm amazed that you love me
[22:09] well I love you too boy and let me show
[22:13] it let me show it to you and how do we
[22:16] show it my loving one another
[22:18] by the way we treat one another because
[22:21] John said that you know you love God you
[22:23] say you love God you're gonna love one
[22:25] another
[22:26] mr Barber
[22:32] suddenly one day
[22:36] yeah
[22:43] that is wonderful Saints I believe God
[22:46] is doing great things in our mist and
[22:48] even in this hour sometimes you know we
[22:51] think that that things have to be done a
[22:53] certain way that but you know God knows
[22:57] exactly what we need how it needs to be
[23:01] in order to affect us according to your
[23:04] makeup because the way he deals with
[23:07] where the Bob may not be the exact same
[23:09] when he deals with me because brother
[23:10] bob is made up a different way than I am
[23:12] but it's always gonna be by the word but
[23:17] by the truth so god bless you
[23:22] [Music]
