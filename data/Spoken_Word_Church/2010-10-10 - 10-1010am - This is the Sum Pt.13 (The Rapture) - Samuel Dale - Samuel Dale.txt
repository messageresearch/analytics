and Ecclesiastes 12 father we thank you for an opportunity of gathering this this morning Lord to be able to come together and to be Lord just be able to sit down for a little while and rest under the shade tree as we call it and listen to you as you would speak to our hearts and our lives we ask you now that you would just Lord come among us and that you'd have your will in way with us and Lord that you may be the preeminent one in us and using us not just as the one that we can you can record our deeds and actions but to come and live in our hearts and lives we love you and we thank you bless those that are not here remember each one and just keep us in Jesus name amen amen now I want to read the first six verses we've been reading verse one all right we've been reading verse one from Hebrews 8 but let's read six verses now now the things which we have spoken this is the PSAL and remember the point the entire seven chapters preceding now he's summing it up this is the sum of what he's been talking about right what is it we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is a necessity that this man have some what also to offer for he were on Earth he should not be a priest what now for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law H now we'll get to that in a minute see this is talking about almighty God coming down to dwell with us all right there is people who were offering those things you understand what Paul is to say who serve unto the example and Shadow of Heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see sayith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount but now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry but how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises now if God's word is yay and amen amen and all the proom promises are Y and amen then we stand on a better promise more Y and amen right all right Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 13 let us hear the conclusion Ecclesiastes the preacher now he's telling you let us hear the conclusion of what he's been trying to explain in in 11 chapters said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God now what is the conclusion fear God and keep his Commandments for the this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word we have been covering now for some time speaking on the what is called the seven compound names of Jehovah we know that there are many more uh names of Jehovah are titles however how you want to say it but it's basically summed up in the uh the compound names of Jehovah like Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tishu Jehovah RI Jehovah shama each one we've covered all of these coming down bringing it to a basis to try to understand that then we would understand if you if you don't value one above the other one that uh you are coming out to the correct understanding now we know we say well we need a savior more than we need a Healer well that's understandable that's that's that's all right but the thing of it is it was the same atonement that made manifest Hallelujah see and if he is our healer our savior he is our healer amen and if he's our healer he's our savior if he's our if he's our peace see then see the shama then he can be anything tiu which is the the one of our righteousness and it's all talking about the one true and living God the Lord Jesus Christ all right now see then he is the high priest that we have we have a great high priest right and other words had he done all of those things without sending a high priest so you say yeah but he was that I agree with you but get the point see that's what I'm trying to get you to see that he if he is all of those things that was revealed and and uh you know spoken of throughout the Bible then surely we would realize that he is and would have to be almighty God made manifest in flesh right because all of that spoke of him and see as I said you'd say but but we need a savior more than we need a Healer but it doesn't work that way that's your mentality that's your uh human thinking of a situation right because you can't separate the atonement that's right if you believe him as I said to be your savior well then you must believe that at the same thing that according to to uh Isaiah 53 that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity and with his stripes were're heal H see it's all tied together into one uh I don't like to use lump some because it's not a that's just a human words that we use it's all gathered together into revealing the one true and living God which would be that the Jehovah of the Old Testament right would have to be the Jesus Christ of the new right you can't separate him and make him a second person third person or whatever you know because that's not uh that's not correct and that's what I'm trying to get us to see if he's one thing he has to be the other if he's our savior he also has to be our Banner to be lifted up if he's our Banner then he has to be our healer and that's the point I'm trying to get us to see that you can't separate it cuz when you try to separate it you're going back toward the trinitarian concept that you're trying to make one person do one thing another person do another thing and another do another or something and you're right back where you would be in the Trinity concept but if you truly believe the Bible that is one true and living God then you believe that there is many manifestations of that God Amen all right that's what I've tried to get you to see about it that uh like Abraham Abraham needed a sacrifice and that was why it came up to be Jehovah J now Abraham at that point didn't need a Healer so whatever God was for the time to him and that's what he must be to you and I sure he must be a savior to save us but then we should realize that once we receive the Savior that all of the other things of God are involved in that one point of Salvation because even the uh the Greek word for healing is the same Greek word for salvation which is the word Soo it's the same word but see if he's one thing to us then he's another now listen I tried to explain it this way if you need a Healer then you don't pray for God to send you a banner you know you don't you don't pray for him to send you a revelation of how righteous he is you're needing a Healer all right see God is whatever we have need of and that way he can manifest himself he did in the Old Testament as we would call it to father but then he come on over Jehovah then he came on over in the New Testament we talk about which is Jesus Christ then he comes on over to where that it's the Holy Ghost dwelling in the people well that's the same God it's not three Gods that's that same God revealed in three manifestations he said well that's what they try to explain to Trinity no now you go talk to them and you ask them and and they'll they'll tell you real quick that they believe it's God in three persons Blessed Trinity and they got make them coal and coeternal well see that that won't tie up with the scripture but get the point I've been trying to make if we need say a banner to come down like it uh it was there you know when the Gideon the it was told to him that it'd be Jehovah to where that would represent a banner now he wasn't praying for a savior he wasn't needing like Abraham a sacrifice in other words see you you put it all together and you just say well well what it is is just one thing you know and then You' say well now there it is to Gideon what he needs is he needs an offering to make he needs a a ram to you know no he didn't need that God reveals himself to us as to what we have need of do you understand that what we have need of what it is for the time that we need but right here today in the building see there's many re many needs cuz one would need a maybe a savior one of maybe a Healer one needs a banner to be raised up to help you know or revelation of the righteousness of God but he doesn't do it like that all at one time to an individual but he reveals himself personal to each one and that was why it was written like that of Jehovah see then it was putting something personal for the moment all right you following me whatever was needed is what God brought forth amen okay now in doing that then he brought it to a place that he could reveal himself throughout the word and not showing himself to one person and that be all but he would reveal what that person needs but then see the next person would need something else that's all I've been trying to explain and that way you keep the one true and living God in the right understanding but it's something personal now listen to what I'm trying to say and don't misinterpret what I say please all of the seven compound names of Jehovah were in the Old Testament okay now Jehovah Gyra is the Lord provided sacrifice okay all right now Abraham and it's going to be hard I told my wife I had to try to explain something Abraham didn't need a savior Isaac was one that needed the sacrifice come on am I right now Isaac was the one that needed the sacrifice Abraham had as I trying to explain there Wednesday he had to sacrifice he was going to crucify right there or kill his own son and burn him up because God told him to right right all right he was walking by faith and saying when Isaac said now Lord here's the wood here's the I mean Daddy here's the wood here's the the fire right we got the knife but where's the sacrifice he said the Lord will provide for himself a sacrifice amen now he was speaking by faith that was great but Abraham wasn't the one that was needing the sacrifice Isaac was the one that was needing it all right now so really then Jehovah Gyra is the Lord provided sacrifice right now then that meant that and other words to fulfill that that was only as we read in the Hebrews these things happen for a an example all right all that we've covered about the seven compound names of Jehovah that's why I said that there's not a Rapture tied into that we'll get to more of that later cuz that's what I want you to look at all right now Gideon as I said he didn't need a sacrifice he needed a banner to be raised up he needed God to come on the scene to fight a battle amen all right now we talk about it to say well now here it is now uh you know and here' come Moses down in Egypt and he'd say well God sent me down here to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt you know out the desert and he said what we're going to do is build an ark you said well they did have the Nile River but that wasn't exactly where they were going the way they were going was totally desert so they didn't need an ark right all right God gives you what you have need of and he gives it to you for the time that you have need of it he you need peace in your heart you're troubled you're worried and things and you need peace that's one of the Jehovah shama see his peace shalom shalom if I get those crossed up you put them in the right place I'm trying to preach but see we cry out for peace and he sends us a Healer that wasn't what we're crying for we crying for peace see God gives you what you have need of now he may not give it the way you want it right but he'll give it to you but you see what we need to do is pray for what we need and let God come on the scene to answer the prayers of what we have need of right that's right but tomorrow we may today we may need a savior tomorrow we may need a Healer so get in your mind because it's going to be very needful once we get on over cuz see we're still in the Old Testament I haven't brought out anything to tie together these names in the New Testament right I'm using it deliberately the Old Testament but that is types and shadows right when you look back there and see what we have need of right right right now the reason I do it is just like Jehovah gy to Abraham Abraham didn't need the savior he didn't need a sacrifice Isaac was the one that needed to sacrifice to be in his place now bring that on over to the New Testament do you know that that sacrifice only preserved Isaac it didn't say Abraham right it only preserved Isaac all right then down in in in the the Wilderness with Moses he needed Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RI he needed the Healer so God didn't send down a ram you understand what I'm driving at he gives you what you have need of write that down in your mind all right if not on paper so here you are out in the the Wilderness with Moses the snakes come up to bite the people he didn't need it a banner to be raised up he didn't need a revelation of the righteousness of God he needed the Healer so God came down and manifested himself as the Healer that's right and it was called Jehovah Gyra I mean Jehovah Raa I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases now if you think that didn't work too good you better remember the way the prophet explained it to us cuz we already been able to read it and see it 40 years in the wilderness and the Bible said their shoes growed on their feet read your Bible the Bible says their clothes never wore out I brother around and said one day said Moses was the only doctor they had and 2 and A2 million people so now you want to look into Moses's little Satchel you know like the doctor carries a little black bag you know he carry he said look down in there what does it say said I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases well everything they had need of it didn't come out of a little Satchel bag it come out of the revelation of Moses speaking to the people CU they got in trouble over there one time and what they do Moses told Aon grab your sensor run among the people right they needed all kind of things in the Bible and God would come on the scene for whatever they had need of right now listen to what I'm trying to say then and please listen we that are saved do we need a savior today now come on we want him all the time right all right come on Stay With Me but what do we need today well as many of sick what we need to heal right as many of us need peace well we need that and God will give those things but you see what you and I need is a fresh Revelation from God Amen as to what's going on in this day amen hallelujah amen we can't live the P brings Faith yeah come on but the the P won't bring it to you correctly because it's the Tope of the Shadow right cuz he's Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice that didn't bring Salvation to Abraham right it brought a Deliverance to Isaac come on Amen if you want to go anywh for types of Salvation you back up into the 15 12 and 15 of Genesis and get where God appeared to Abraham about it to type our salvation but those things back there were a type right amen but look what a wonderful thing it was right don't you think Isaac was pretty happy right amen he didn't have to die right well Abraham was was pretty happy too cuz he didn't have to kill his son right a Deliverance was brought amen but that did not give Isaac the new birth right he didn't give Abra excuse me Abraham the new birth right it was what they needed for the time right and having the need for the time would speak of what you and I have need of but it must be magnified into a greater understanding even to move into the New Testament if Jehovah Gyra was the Lord's provided sacrifice for Abraham to save his son how much more would Jehovah Gyra be to you and I under the new birth right amen what does it bring to you and I H Moses needed a Healer right right and the Lord said I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases Jehovah RI but you see to you and I the Healer if actually inside of us right amen does not God live in You by the new birth that's right amen well then where's your healer bless it that's why I proved the point I hope at least it did to my understanding that we don't put Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah Rea into the same place of the atonement we make one higher than the other oh my because we confess what the doctor says oh my the doctor says you're sick all right that that's fine you are sick Richard and I were talking about it the other day when they told him he had cancer son-in-law they told him he had that he said I just turned around to him and told told him said now Richard a negative confession won't you know just a confession won't do it in other words you confess it right amen we need to do that right but that's not the Healer that's right you confess your way into it you keep confessing it until it becomes a reality right yes sir but just a statement from your mind out is not enough but we ought to realize the healer is inside of us by the new birth then we wouldn't be praying somewhere else to get a Healer that's right we'd be talking to the god that dwells within us no we say what the doctor says we say the doctor says this when I do that on your salvation the devil says you're lost why don't you confess that come on I'm not being sarcastic I'm telling it like it is you're not going to say what the devil says are you well you I I put it like this the doctor tells me what's wrong with me I say that's what he says right I say by strips I'm Healed that's right amen he says I'm this I say this right I go to him thank God for our doctors amen I was over there in in Brazil when that brother he he was just coming into the message and he was a doctor and he was actually a plast what you call plastic surgeon for the face you know and everything really fancy thing and he was telling how that he was that even his cohorts was amazed at the way that he could cut around where that he knew where the nerves were at and that he could actually do that plastic surgery to your faces and places and not even destroy a nerve because he knew where they were at and doing you know I said Doctor don't you realize that's a gift God gave you a gift he sat there and just cried was he gave you a gift thank God for doctors but there's plenty of quacks too but let's solve the problem there's plenty of quack preachers like your Prophet said it one day he said I find more doctors that agree with Divine Healing than I do preachers oh my now that's what he said about it yes why because the truth is the truth I told you about that up gam when I go to he said they actually some of his cohorts said to him one day said how can you know as you do all about medical science and agree that God is the Healer he said he turned and looked back at him he said how can you know all you know about medical science and not know that God is a right amen amen I said Thank You doc but listen what do we have need of today now all that we see all that we're talking about everything is an example right everything is a foundation all that we've talked about this about the seven compound names of Jehovah is just a foundation because we brought none of them into the New Testament form amen and see then you get the wrong idea when I say things like well Abraham didn't need a savior that was not salvation to Abraham it was salvation to Isaac L those years but it wasn't salvation to Isaac to give him a new birth right it did not bring him eternal life right all the things that God revealed to those Old Testament Saints and look at the marvelous things he revealed and the great things happened but not any of it brought them a new birth cuz Jesus Christ hadn't died they couldn't be anym that's why they couldn't be Rapture back there that should be a simple point for you to understand and it shouldn't have been a a a hard thing when I made the statement that that I hadn't preached anything about the Rapture in the seven compound name cuz all I was preaching about is what's over Earth right now all those sell compound Nam is right here even coming down to Shamar meaning what his presence right well if he don't come here we don't go there right right then what should we be praying for well I'll figure out one of those compound names and it'll fit in there and I'll pray for that that won't work why not pray for the complete revelation of all the compound names amen cuz you know what they wound up being you take every one of them that's what I've been preaching every one of those compound names comes out to be where to bring Jesus Christ upon the Earth amen all of that Old Testament offering those lambs and those sacrifices and things was only speaking of Jesus Christ right you know that that only that didn't do away with sin that only covered it just you know and it was every bit pushed to Calvary that's why the scripture said he died once for all when Jesus Christ died on the cross he died for the Old Testament Saints as well as the New Testament cuz he had to pay the price for them but are we bringing it over to our day are still talking about oh it's a great wonderful thing that Abraham had Faith but you know what if that's all we know about it it should be embarrassing to us to realize that Abraham didn't have the new birth all that was brought to Abraham never gave him eternal life right man he toal dependence was Upon Jesus Christ to pay the price that's right am am just because it was Jehovah gy the Lord's provided sacrifice that only meant there was a lamb to be supplied there am but it spoke that there was a lamb come I am the Lord that heals all of th diseases Moses in his doctor satel to heal the diseases of the people that only spoke of Calvary amen Gideon was a great man of Valor raised up that God called it a banner that only spoke of what happened at Calvary cuz you see the seven compound names of Jehovah just like what your Prophet says about it Jehovah is not a name they translated that out of jvh they translated Jehovah from that and he says in the scriptures by my name Jehovah was I never known right and that's scripture when I told Jehovah Witness one day I wasn't making light of him I just told him I said Jehovah is not a name sir well yeah it is it's Jehovah I said no it's a title right it's a title to a name right it's not a name thank you it was only speaking of Jesus Christ that's why when the prophet saw that it was such a great thing for him to understand that Jehovah the old was a Jesus of the new making it one true and living God right amen and then seeing it then seeing him manifest himself that dire all of those things was only speaking of the day that he would walk on earth right he's our peace he's our Banner right he's our Shepherd Hallelujah when we took that Wednesday night and tried to to show it there and save that one to the life of the seven compound names with Jehovah r r a a h they spell it two three different ways that's all right to think did you catch what I was saying that it took many many books many many places for God to cover that he was Jehovah jarak to one Jehovah RFI to another Jehovah Banner to another one Jehovah peace to another but we took it right there from the 23rd psalm in showing that in there in five verses cuz there six verses 23rd but the six verses are summing up with what was said in five verses the psalmist David went through all seven compound names of Jehovah and there even are 10 compound names because you got mananas Manasses you got all and all of those is in Psalms 23 what about a man catching that revelation that summed up in five verses the entire revelation of Jehovah God and the man wouldn't even born again that received the Revelation there was no person in the Old Testament in a born again experience cuz Jesus Christ had not died that's why we read all the other in Hebrew cuz he he see you can't have the New Testament without you got to death to the testator right that's why I say to people you know turn to the book of New Testament they'll turn to Matthew that's not the first book of the New Testament cuz Jesus was still under the law in Matthew he why he told him he said healed the people they said go down there and offer the offering to Moses right see the New Testament never come into being until the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came Jesus Christ was that New Testament amen and he had to shed his life for that life to be able to come into somebody why he told Nicodemus you must be born again the way we do it is we say well what he said to Nicodemus Nicodemus you just need to know about all of the compound names with Jehovah now you think Nicodemus didn't know it the Bible call him the original translation called him the teacher Jesus said th a teacher the original translation said th the teacher the highest of all the teachers of Israel and he couldn't comprehend what the new birth was of course we Baptist come along and what we said well all you got to do is believe oh now Paul said have you receive the holy ghost S you believe that's right that don't mean anything not throwing off on the bad is where I come from cuz this is what I Su you I know what her Doctrine was right but you see then according to the Baptist Doctrine then Nicodemus was a born again believer oh my cuz he believed everything Jesus said and he brought he put his life on the line in other words he'd be throw out from being in any line of priest or anything if they found him sitting over talking to the Lord Jesus right amen come on am right he put his life on the line he put his job on the line to get to Jesus and Jesus said you must be born again what do you you mean I know all the laws I know all the rules I know all about Jehovah gy I know all about Jehovah Rafa I know all about Jehovah tishu I know all about these things but Jesus said that's not what I'm talking about I'm mean you got to be born from above cuz that's what your original translation say You must be born from above Jesus was from above right you got to be born from where I come from right cuz I'm the head of the New Testament but you see then do we really see that what we need is a personal revelation today amen hallelujah of the hour that we're living come on Amen and we'll get to it this afternoon some that's why Paul said therefore leav in Hebrews 6 leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go into Perfection right I'll repeat this evening what I'm saying therefore let's leave the principles of the doctrines of the seven compound names of Jehovah and all of them applying to Jesus Christ and let's go on to Perfection come on Hallelujah wasn't that what Paul said but get to the point of what I'm saying we talk about a Rapture but see Rapture is a revelation unto you healing is a revelation you can't be saved right you cannot be saved without a revelation of Jesus Christ amen cuz you're only saying the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost that's right amen so you're only saying what somebody else said the preacher said it your daddy said it your mother said it thank God for all the says but what is it to you is it something personal is it something real to you come on Hallelujah well I'm just in the message preach brother no oh my Paul said have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost Since You Believe come on have you have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you come in this message come on brother what do you mean prove the come in oh my well don't worry about you're fixing to leave anyway oh cuz that's what people are going to do that's right you can't help but manifest what you are that's right amen you let this thing go on for just a little bit longer right amen she's dragging pretty low now people are walking out amen you let her drag a little further that's right but see those who really have it will stay those who don't will be moving on oh to somewhere else CU they don't know what's going on oh Father but you see your Prophet said Jehovah the old and Jesus is the new right so then all of the compound names of Jehovah must be applied in a new testament form amen as to Jesus Christ Hallelujah am I right right I believe it he must be all of those things that's right but he must be all of those things to you and I by revelation amen amen before we can talk about going on to Perfection oh my you know that Paul understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new you think Paul and him didn't understand the the seven compound names of Jehovah you know that really the revelation of some compound names of Jehovah would only be based in our in doing the New Testament would only be based in the face of the father because they understood exactly what Jesus was talking about after the New Birth came that's right amen they didn't understand what he's talking about at all right but when the new birth came it was brought to their remembrance what he had said have you read your Bible and then they were willing to give their life for what they believe that's right so then what is a Rapture Rapture is a revelation amen Rapture is a revelation what is healing how do you get healed let's start off how do you get saved sa what does the Bible say about salvation how do you get saved he that cometh God must believe that he is and reward of them that diligently seek him that's scripture right amen but what does he say in Romans there he said because what confessing it with your mouth that's not all of it plenty of confessions is made by the mouth right that's what I said you talk to people about Christianity you talk to them about one true and living God and you know what they'll tell you most of the time I can't deny the father I got to believe in a trinity if I deny the father I'll deny the son yeah talk to them ask no about it and see what they'll tell you but see it says what to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth now what's in the heart must be said the same by the mouth that's why I quoted that other scripture it said he that cometh to God must believe that he is amen not was that's right he is right now amen personal to you right and a rewarder of that diligently seek him see that's why people don't get saved they quote what somebody else says now God don't have to to to honor what somebody else says right you go to him talk to him so and so said so and so he'll just tell you I don't care what he said but go to him and say you told me that's right and he'll come right on the scene that's right because it's got to be something personal to you it's not just words letters on the page doctrinal issues that's right it's believing in your heart right that God ha died for you and I right and raised for our justification as the scripture says right and then to confess that with our mouth what that he died for me amen not that I shout and spoken tongues cried or done something right oh that's wonderful but that's after the baby gets here let's get the baby in with life first right normal baby what happen when it comes forth in the womb a lot of times the struggle of doing that will make it gasp out and start crying but something takes place life comes right right but then it cries and T what because it's a baby Christians cry why because they're Christians Christians speak in tongues why because they they're Christians right Christians see Vision why cuz they're Christians but don't try to base it on something you've done right based on what God Said right but you see that's hard for people to do they can't do like I've told you my experience of two years after coming in this message to not claim that I could read six books a day and listen to two tapes would be my salvation not claim that I could explain the one true and living God to the letter back there too but I based it on a personal experience that I had after 2 years amen of confessing it well you sure what's slow I guess that's about right I am I still am now bless I got something Hallelujah and what I've got is Hell me after all these 40 something years come on but it's held me to the word it's hel me to the word then I can read back there and I can see Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new and then I can read that Jesus according to Paul said is not I that liveth but what the Christ that liveth in the the life that I now live in thee flesh I live by thee faith of the son cuz who's living in you Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RI all the seven compound names are living inside of you by the new birth we don't have to go somewhere else to try to get it it's not that you got to pray it down from heaven come on it's inside of you come on Amen it's in thy mouth as Paul said right the word of faith that we preach that's right Hallelujah but we must say from the mouth what God says right that's where our trouble's at we say what somebody else says we talk about what somebody else believes put it in your own oh my thank you see I'm honest you this way explain to me your Revelation amen thank you don't tell me brother Brown said so and so and so you know that's fine I understand but tell me what's in your heart that's right amen tell me something personal about yourself come on Amen cuz see Rapture is a revelation amen for you to be saved it must be revealed to you Amen Brother D I've never had a revelation I say well then I'm just as honest as I can be I know one man one time said something to me and I offended him because I told him I said people are saved don't act like that come on he walked out the door and didn't come back he said I degraded his Christianity no I didn't I just told him the truth right right I mean brother Donnie if I told you would say now you they know about you you out drunk you done all these things and I said Christian don't act like that did I degrade your Christianity no you didn't have any that's as blown as I can be if you had it you wouldn't do that what you brother Dale you offended brother so and so for what for telling the truth come on listen the seven compound names of Jehovah all right now they all had an Old Testament application I'm trying to get it down a quit right they all had an Old Testament application and every one of them was to people that were not born again right now you agree there were the people that were not born again well now if we're born again how much greater should those things be to you and I right amen do I need to say it over and over and over I know I do a lot I repeat a lot because I want you to think about it it didn't bring Salvation to Abraham it brought Deliverance to Isaac right it never brought Abraham the new birth you couldn't do that in the Old Testament you had to wait till Jesus Christ came and died to be able to have the new birth now I'm not saying they were lost I explained that what they done pushed to Calvary and Jesus Christ paid for that right amen not saying they were lost no but I'm saying they wouldn't born again that's right amen cuz that's the New Testament amen the New Covenant amen which would require a New Birth come on listen L each one of those things of the seven compound names of Jehovah only spoke of of what was to take place in the New Testament all right each one of them was dealing like I said about Jehovah is not a name see Jesus was the name they didn't name him Jehovah when he came right and the Bible said it's supposed to name him Emmanuel come on right right is that Bible right his name Shall be Called Emmanuel and you know out the four writers not one of them named em Emmanuel that's right and Paul of all his writings and the thing he never brought it to that why because what was the name of Emmanuel Jesus Jesus God what was the name of Jehovah Jesus the first time that it was spoke to a human mortal right by another human mortal right it brought John the Baptist to life that had been dead in his mother's wom Hallelujah he hadn't moved or anything read your Bible that's right it brought life the first time that it was pronounced amen it because now get me come on the word Jesus I'll show you where the Prophet said this so you went on a problem with it amen don't have it with me but the name Jesus has been used many many right that wasn't a a thing that it waited until right there at that point and in the name Jesus just happened to appear no no the name Jesus was used many many times before then that was that was a name but when it was spoken by the lips of a mortal being that had an experience come on of knowing what that name was it brought life right that's why you can say Jesus Jesus and not get nothing you pray Jesus Jesus but who you praying to come on Brother come on well brother D I'm praying to the second person so he can take care of it with the third person and all these secretaries and I I just don't agree with that no you know how secretaries mess everything up right all they got to do is misunderstand the boss and they write the wrong letters right that's right and they send out to places and they send things and some of you that are secretaries are grinning because you know it's happened that you send out the letters to the wrong people because you're secretaries you don't know what the boss wanted you're only reading off the paper and you misunderstanding and you goof everything up right I don't want no secretary I want to talk to the person all right when I talk to Jesus I'm not saying Jesus will you take this and deliver it up to the father I know who I'm talking to right and his name is Jesus amen where did the Rapture I'm going to end it right here cuz I won't get it this evening now it'll be later where did the rapture start right amen well it started in 63 I well you sure didn't listen to the series I preached on when did he start his second coming he started his second coming on the day of Pentecost right it will climax in this age the Revelation and the doings will climax here right right but he's been coming all the way there when they received the new birth on the day of Pentecost I thought the Bible said that they were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah now remember what I'm saying just what it took me a long series to preach on the second coming that there's plenty of things that take place in this day yes and the rapture could not have come until this end time yes but the Rapture started on the day of Pentecost when the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into the hearts of the Saints because it resurrected them and set them in Heavenly places the Rapture is inside of you amen cuz it's a revelation amen it's a revelation I'm just leave that part but I want you to think on that the Rapture started when the day of Pentecost came with the Holy Ghost descending CU it raised them people up into Heavenly places but there's a lot to the Rapture that's got to take place because according to the prophet of God and the Bible there's like three things that take place in the Rapture right the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel of trumpet right and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which will arive and remain will be changed right so there's a lot to take place don't go say brother Dale says the Rapture is just the new birth I didn't say that right so you're lying I never said that the second coming of Jesus Christ was just the holy ghost coming on De Pentecost I never said that I said it would have to climax because if it don't climax in this day that's why I've been reading that scripture over every service this is the sum of what I'm talking about right this is a summing up of all the message that your Prophet has brought in all the scriptures and over 40 years of preaching on it this is the sum of it don't think I'm backing up you're going to get out on the limb when you do that yes but brother Dale it's very simple I thought it was supposed to be so simple that an that an illiterate child can understand it the days of Simplicity that's why people don't understand me I preach simple and they try to figure me out of something deep very simple cuz I'm very simple-minded I try to relate everything back to you I got a note from a person from today and they listening to the seals that I preached in 198 2 said you got a unique way of trying to make things instead of it being so great big out to people that you make it simple thank you as being in our hearts and lives right why is it not that way that's right but you see if something has to be revealed Brother Gary now listen to me something has to be revealed to you brother Gary you know what that means you didn't know it right is that simple enough if it's something to be revealed that means you didn't know it you may know all the mechanical lineup right you may know all the quotes right you may know all of the statements right but it's not revealed come on that's just like so you come up here and I say anybody need to be prayed for and you come up here well I'm not not going to say that I'm sick what you doing up here right I mean you admit you're sick by walking up here come on right then you going to turn around and say I'm not going to admit I'm sick what's wrong with you well I'll tell you the doctor said what's wrong come on well brother Dale that's reason I don't call you oh well the reason you don't call me you don't want to know it like it is oh my cuz I'm sick brother Dale and you tell me that no I don't tell you're not sick I tell you I know you're sick cuz you wouldn't call me if you wouldn't sick but you see we like to make them great big confessions confession is fine if it's what God Said right amen that's it but if not it's what somebody told you come on musicians come on Rapture is a revelation it's the word of God revealed to you okay it's a revelation we must speak it before God Can Make It manifest right well then it I saying a moment ago then you say well brother Dale I I know I've got to say it so I'm saying by Stripes I'm Healed now listen if you're telling me by Stripes I'm Healed I come to brother col I said brother call going tell you something by Stripes I'm Healed that means I'm admitting in in the inside of me in the conscience form and the part of humanity that I am I'm admitting I'm sick right cuz I'm telling you to pray for me if I ain't sick what I want in to pray for me well don't want anybody to pray for me if I'm not sick you see we try to make it in some kind of a great thing that we think we have instead of it being simple by his stripes I'm need and I believe it and I'm going to confess it yes Lord salvation is the same thing believe in your heart confess with your mouth what about the man that brother around talked about you know that that was blind and and there he was selling newspapers out on the street everybody was making fun of him why because he was out there saying you know extra extra read all about it you know how they sell the newspapers and he said by St I'm he I see and I said you're lying you can't see but you know he kept confessing it to one day sitting in a barber's chair and the barber was fixing the ladder him up and get ready to shave him he said you know kind of making light of him you know said I thought you out here confessing you can see he said I can and that his eyes po open me jumped up and took off why cuz he confessed it until it become a reality don't right on my Tombstone I died of cancer right on there that he died of of the effects of what they call cancer but until his last breath was drawn he said by Stripes I'm Healed why because let me say what he said because listen folks you don't do your salvation that way right you don't say I'm saved and then somebody comes along gets on well I don't really know where I am or not well I think I am but I don't know where I am or not you no no you keep me your confession right so is it in all things with God right you confess yourself into it cuz you say what he said if you need salvation just start saying I'm he saying Lord thank you for saving me thank you for saving me well I said it 2,000 times we'll try one more right cuz that's the way God did let's Stand Together 188 188 anybody has a need come in let's see and let's look from his glor everything my God and Jesus was his name my brother hurt his back so let's believe what let by his stripes he's he go to the doctor let them check you out do whatever you got to do for the human elements take pain pills and all of that right cuz it ain't Faith to say I'm going to deny talking about Richard said you deny that you that won't save you when you look right straight at it and say thank you Lord for healing me the same as you said thank you for saving me Father we lay our hands upon our brothers knowing that this pain and Agony from the back that we've laid in the floor and cried Lord done everything trying to get relief and knowing that there's only one Healer father just reach down and touch our brother and take away that pain father if there was any way that as human possible we would take the pain that he has but that cannot be done and it wouldn't help if we could cuz it wouldn't bring you into Glory and Honor you are the one that's getting the honor of all of the healing you're the Healer you're the all and all in Jesus is your name so just touch our brother and deliver him in Jesus name anybody else just believe it say I'm Healed to you he to sa my father you heard our little sister Lord Jesus she made her word to you to confess what you say
