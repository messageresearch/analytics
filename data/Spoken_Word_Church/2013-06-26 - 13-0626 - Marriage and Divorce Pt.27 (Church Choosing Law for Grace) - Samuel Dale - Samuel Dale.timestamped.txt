[3:49] eyes of understanding unto you
[3:52] as to what you would desire for us
[3:55] in this hour
[3:57] and lord just remember the sick touch
[4:00] each one father because we know that you
[4:02] said you in your word that you said you
[4:04] sent your word
[4:05] and healed us and delivered us from
[4:07] destruction so we believe you and we
[4:10] thank you
[4:11] we just ask you to make it a
[4:12] manifestation now into the hearts and
[4:14] the lives of the people we love you and
[4:17] we cherish lord your presence tonight
[4:19] with us to speak and not us
[4:21] but that you would take over and use our
[4:23] lips to speak unto your people
[4:25] for this purpose we've gathered tonight
[4:28] to serve you lord and to love you in
[4:30] jesus name
[4:31] amen
[4:35] due to us we'll go to
[4:37] the romans first and then deuteronomy
[4:40] no you're not brethren for i speak to
[4:42] them that know the law
[4:43] have the law had dominion over a man as
[4:45] long as he liveth
[4:47] but the woman which hath and husband is
[4:49] bound by the law to her husband
[4:51] but a woman which excuse me which hath
[4:54] in husband is bound by the law to her
[4:56] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[4:59] husband be dead she is loose from the
[5:01] law of her husband now remember
[5:03] this is what
[5:04] an illustration
[5:07] not just speaking necessarily of
[5:09] marriage and divorce et cetera but an
[5:11] illustration
[5:13] of how that
[5:15] we've got to be dead
[5:17] to be born again right so if then while
[5:19] her husband lives she'd be married to
[5:21] another man she shall be called an
[5:22] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[5:24] she is free from that law so that she is
[5:26] no adulteress though she'll be married
[5:28] to another man
[5:30] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[5:32] dead to the law by the body of christ
[5:34] that you should be married to another
[5:36] even to him who is raised from the dead
[5:38] that we should bring forth fruit under
[5:40] god for when we were in the flesh the
[5:42] motions of sin which were by the law
[5:45] did work in our members to bring forth
[5:47] fruit unto death but now we are
[5:50] delivered from the law that being dead
[5:52] were in we were held that we should
[5:54] serve in the newness of spirit
[5:57] and not in the oldness of the letter
[6:00] okay
[6:01] let's go to deuteronomy 2
[6:04] while you're getting there remember this
[6:06] is
[6:07] the first one then we turned and took
[6:09] our journey into the wilderness and and
[6:11] all in was a mount around mount seer
[6:14] verse three is where we want
[6:16] uh verse two said in the lord speak unto
[6:18] me saying verse 3 there's where we want
[6:21] to take our thought from
[6:22] you have compassed this mountain
[6:25] long enough
[6:26] to turn ye northward you may be seated
[6:29] the lord had his blessing
[6:31] to the reading of the word now
[6:36] we have been
[6:37] trying to cover these things of
[6:41] speaking of law and grace
[6:43] speaking of marriage and divorce
[6:46] speaking of the invisible union
[6:49] and trying to tie it all together as to
[6:52] where that we can
[6:54] come forth and look at
[6:56] the uh
[6:57] the situation but we're not wanting to
[6:59] look at the situation back there that is
[7:02] a lot of times our point our thought
[7:05] people will build their message
[7:07] around back there
[7:10] and you know the the secret mysteries
[7:12] and the things that were back there and
[7:15] and all instead of bringing it down to
[7:18] where we're living now tonight i want us
[7:21] to get down to the very nitty gritty
[7:23] points of you and i
[7:25] and maybe that's why a lot of people's
[7:27] out tonight
[7:29] they sensed that so you know
[7:31] okay
[7:33] we're going to be talking about you and
[7:34] i tonight not somewheres else we will
[7:37] mention
[7:38] other things and talk about it but
[7:40] mainly about you and i
[7:43] because i think
[7:45] that
[7:47] you know we've been here long enough
[7:49] after the passing of the prophet
[7:52] and i think it's our fault
[7:55] you know i don't think it's god's fault
[7:58] i think it's our fault i think it's like
[8:01] the prophet of god said
[8:03] moses was there ready
[8:06] but the people wasn't ready
[8:09] so
[8:10] god had to take moses to the wilderness
[8:12] and kept him out there for 40 years
[8:15] until the people got ready
[8:18] and when they began to cry out unto god
[8:20] for a deliverer god
[8:22] sent them a deliverer through moses
[8:25] all right but
[8:27] the point is the waiting the prophet
[8:29] said in the church age book there of the
[8:31] especially the part that ties with
[8:33] spoken words original seed
[8:35] that
[8:36] the part of it was was waiting on the
[8:39] people
[8:42] to be crying out
[8:44] well
[8:45] maybe we're not hungry enough maybe
[8:47] we're not burdened enough maybe we're
[8:48] not into a lot of things
[8:51] i certainly don't want to try to preach
[8:53] as a doomsday style
[8:55] but
[8:56] you know the prophet did say the church
[8:58] always done better under persecution
[9:01] because that's when the time comes that
[9:03] we show our colors and and do you know
[9:06] and and all of that but
[9:09] if you can't keep up with the footman
[9:11] don't worry about it when the horsemen
[9:12] get here
[9:13] because you just won't be there you know
[9:15] if you can't uh come to church and and
[9:18] serve god now just don't worry about it
[9:20] then it'll all be taken care of you'll
[9:22] have a good excuse for not to coming
[9:24] around
[9:25] but somebody's going to be there
[9:28] and i'm contending and i'm one of them
[9:31] i don't know how you feel but i contend
[9:33] i'm one of those and i want to i want to
[9:35] be prepared
[9:37] and then to look at it and to see
[9:40] ourselves
[9:41] and the thought for tonight
[9:44] is church
[9:46] choosing law for grace
[9:50] now i ask you to listen to that message
[9:52] where brother around and preached it you
[9:53] know and title it i think it's 61.
[9:57] oh maybe let's see
[9:59] it's 61 something i know it's in 61.
[10:01] 316. 316 1961 all right i ask you to
[10:05] listen to that to see ourselves
[10:09] because in that message he's bringing it
[10:12] down to you and i am
[10:14] church
[10:16] right
[10:17] right
[10:18] church
[10:20] choosing law for grace
[10:22] now we went through sunday and gave a
[10:24] good bit of points of thinking where he
[10:27] was talking about church
[10:28] choosing law instead of grace
[10:32] now to choose something instead of is is
[10:36] not too bad
[10:38] you know i mean it is but still you
[10:40] you're doing it and knowing what you're
[10:42] doing
[10:44] but when you're choosing something for
[10:46] something else
[10:48] and thinking it's the same thing right
[10:51] now there's where the danger part comes
[10:55] to think well you know well brother dale
[10:56] we you know we ended up by saying
[10:59] that the prophet gave an illustration of
[11:01] two classes of people
[11:03] and one class was i go to church
[11:06] i pay my child i do everything you know
[11:09] and all like that and he said that's
[11:10] good and well and all he said the other
[11:13] one says i do these things
[11:15] but said i do it because of the love
[11:17] that's within our my heart
[11:20] because i want to
[11:22] all right
[11:23] now which one of those do we want to
[11:25] classify ourselves as being
[11:28] you know
[11:29] right
[11:30] you you can
[11:32] force yourself to come to church and and
[11:34] to do and try to live right
[11:38] but the biggest problem is when we
[11:40] become to the place and this is the
[11:41] thought for the message tonight so
[11:43] listen
[11:44] is when we come to the place to think
[11:47] that
[11:49] what we're doing is right
[11:53] when it's not right
[11:57] now
[11:58] as we were talking downstairs before we
[12:00] come up today
[12:02] you know it was all right for martin
[12:04] luther to believe i don't mean it was
[12:06] all right
[12:08] but martin luther believed in the
[12:09] trinity
[12:11] believed in the catholic church he only
[12:13] wanted to try to convert to church he
[12:15] didn't want to get out of it
[12:18] that's his own words
[12:19] all right
[12:20] but see that won't fit today
[12:24] right
[12:25] why
[12:27] because word has been revealed
[12:30] truth has been opened unto us and we can
[12:33] see that there's got to be more than
[12:36] just
[12:37] going to church
[12:40] being good
[12:41] and all of that
[12:44] because that's not what god is coming
[12:45] back after
[12:47] he's coming back after a word-born bride
[12:53] well
[12:54] that's what he's been waiting for
[12:59] all right and that's you know that's our
[13:01] thought
[13:02] church choosing law for grace in other
[13:05] words choosing a way that would
[13:08] be some other way than what god wants
[13:12] but to believe that's the way he wanted
[13:13] now i i hope i proved the point sunday
[13:16] afternoon that some of you didn't hear
[13:18] the message and i made the statements
[13:20] and showed where the prophet said they
[13:22] thought they were right
[13:25] they thought they were right
[13:28] in other words they thought that's what
[13:30] god wanted
[13:35] god had done explained to them who they
[13:37] were and what they were
[13:40] and they said well
[13:41] oh good
[13:42] now give us something to do
[13:44] in other words we we're here now we
[13:46] believe you
[13:48] we want something to do
[13:51] and he said that was their fatal mistake
[13:57] and see by doing that they didn't think
[13:59] they were wrong
[14:02] do you think cain thought he was wrong
[14:05] very sincere he worked himself to death
[14:08] to gather up some fruit to bring to god
[14:14] see are we
[14:15] then putting it to something that
[14:18] would be killing us
[14:24] and us not knowing it
[14:28] now that would be the worst part
[14:29] wouldn't it
[14:31] you remember the story brought around
[14:32] told about the old eagle that they'd
[14:34] caught and brought in and put him in the
[14:35] cage and
[14:37] he's beating his feathers out in his
[14:38] head and bumping it against the cage
[14:40] that he was
[14:43] built to go into the sky
[14:46] but he said now that is bad
[14:50] but he said to see people
[14:53] sitting in churches
[14:55] thinking they're right
[14:58] when they're not amen
[15:01] he said that's horrible
[15:03] well let's talk about lula today
[15:05] everybody else out there that's on the
[15:06] internet can be listening if they don't
[15:08] count themselves a part of this then
[15:10] we're just talking they're just
[15:11] listening
[15:14] don't cost them anything
[15:18] but now
[15:21] what about choosing law
[15:24] instead of grace
[15:26] i've got an opportunity to take this
[15:30] or i got an opportunity to take that
[15:33] that was the thought for the sunday's
[15:35] message
[15:38] all right
[15:39] they thought this was right over here
[15:42] with the law and the things
[15:45] and that was the way they went
[15:48] all right
[15:50] now let's step it up a step tonight
[15:55] to go on
[15:56] choosing law for grace
[16:00] not going over here
[16:02] and something else over here
[16:09] because it's like i've always tried to
[16:10] explain that we
[16:12] we say poro nicodemus
[16:15] when jesus said you must be born again
[16:18] all he had to do is believe
[16:22] right i'll probably use that about 40
[16:24] 000 times
[16:26] this year i guess
[16:28] but
[16:32] see we think well all that just believed
[16:36] well he was a pretty good believer
[16:39] he confessed
[16:40] that no man can do the things you do
[16:43] unless it be of god
[16:45] put his life on the line his job on the
[16:47] line
[16:50] but we think all that does just believe
[16:51] it
[16:53] we see that was death
[16:56] will you agree
[16:59] will you agree in your own thinking
[17:02] now that to
[17:06] nicodemus
[17:07] what he
[17:09] chose
[17:13] was death
[17:16] he had an opportunity for life
[17:20] right
[17:21] thank god the prophet explained it that
[17:24] through that believing that nicodemus
[17:26] had he said nicodemus and gamalia would
[17:28] be there as a foolish virgins
[17:31] i thank god for that that's that's
[17:32] wonderful
[17:34] because they they've kind of put forth
[17:36] an effort see
[17:38] and it god didn't leave them out of it
[17:40] right
[17:41] now
[17:43] but nicodemus
[17:46] he chose to stay where he was at
[17:52] instead of moving on
[17:55] right
[17:58] now
[17:59] trying to illustrate what we're talking
[18:01] about tonight
[18:02] of a church choosing law for grace
[18:07] hypothetical situation but explaining it
[18:10] or expressing it illustrating it
[18:12] see today the problem is is
[18:16] the nicodemus is us
[18:20] are presented the opportunity
[18:24] and we receive that opportunity
[18:31] and we become born again christians
[18:38] but then because of our
[18:40] theology
[18:47] we walk in a way that we think is the
[18:49] way of god
[18:53] that's choosing law see in other words
[18:56] nicodemus you'll see what i'm talking
[18:57] about the children of israel we'll take
[18:59] this
[19:00] instead of this
[19:02] nicodemus said i got to stay with this i
[19:04] can't go with you
[19:06] but see we step out we go with him
[19:10] to me that's what paul is talking about
[19:13] why is paul speaking to the romans
[19:17] that are born again christians
[19:22] right
[19:24] go back to about the first chapter
[19:26] you'll probably hear him saying speaking
[19:28] to the saints
[19:30] because the bible's not written to the
[19:31] world it's written to christians
[19:34] and
[19:36] paul is explaining that
[19:39] we must be dead to the law
[19:42] he's explaining in his own words later
[19:45] on that
[19:47] what i thought was life
[19:49] i found to be death
[19:52] if there's nothing wrong with the law
[19:55] he expressed that
[19:59] but you see if we just step out and walk
[20:01] even with christ
[20:05] and we still hold on to any little idea
[20:10] any thought
[20:13] any concept whatsoever
[20:17] we were life and dinner while ago and i
[20:19] come up couldn't even find it richard
[20:21] had finally found it he said he need to
[20:22] give me an alphabet i said i know the
[20:24] letters i just can't get them in order
[20:28] but
[20:29] brother brown speaks about
[20:32] dialogue remember how you pronounce it d
[20:35] e
[20:36] what is d-a-c-e-l
[20:39] dialogue
[20:40] it's d-e-c-a-l-o-g-u-e
[20:45] all right
[20:47] and he tells you what that is
[20:52] and we were talking about that
[20:55] in the basis of uh
[20:59] what it means
[21:01] it means an organization
[21:05] back phrasing now coming backwards i'm
[21:07] getting the for the definition of
[21:09] organization to come over to
[21:12] the dialogue or dialogue or how you
[21:14] pronounce the word you pronounce it i
[21:15] spelled it where you'll know what it is
[21:21] but you see we can take
[21:24] and i'm not de-christianizing anybody
[21:26] i'm talking i'm talking about christians
[21:29] born again believers
[21:33] and what is keeping us here
[21:37] is our own ideas
[21:42] no i'm waiting on you
[21:45] well that's your idea
[21:47] right
[21:49] and all you got to do is get a couple
[21:50] agree with you and you've got a
[21:52] dialogue or how you pronounce that word
[21:56] huh well you get a group
[22:00] and that's what we all want isn't it
[22:05] you know my definition of why people are
[22:07] caught from for crimes because you you
[22:10] just can't keep your mouth shut
[22:13] you just feel so dirty that you went out
[22:15] and killed 18 people
[22:18] maybe you just feel bad
[22:20] you can't sleep
[22:22] so you go down to the neighbors and you
[22:24] tell the neighbor
[22:27] well you know he ever thought about
[22:28] killing somebody
[22:31] the neighbor said well no if he said no
[22:34] i wouldn't do that well you can move
[22:35] that neighbor and you go to another
[22:36] neighbor but and while you're gonna find
[22:38] somebody that'll sympathize with you
[22:41] and then you can tell them well i killed
[22:43] 18 people i just feel bad
[22:46] well they'll say well that's all right
[22:47] because i kill 19 and i feel bad too
[22:51] you say that's stupid
[22:53] that's exactly what i mean
[22:56] that's how stupid you and i are
[23:00] if you don't like those words
[23:02] talking to my neighbor today i said
[23:03] sometimes i tell the people the door
[23:05] swings out
[23:07] you know
[23:08] i said i don't want anybody to leave the
[23:10] church but in fact if what i say to you
[23:12] makes you leave then that's your problem
[23:16] but listen i'm trying to dig down into
[23:18] you and me
[23:21] and dig out these
[23:24] problems and ideas
[23:28] why did the prophet say we're in these
[23:30] problems of marriage and divorce
[23:32] he said misinterpreted theology
[23:36] we read some quotes our sunday where
[23:39] that the children of israel wanted a
[23:40] theological
[23:42] thing
[23:43] where they could argue about it
[23:50] don't that sound like organizations
[23:56] some of you've been in the message long
[23:58] enough that they don't say it too much
[23:59] now because it's kind of got a
[24:03] i guess people rebuked it so much but
[24:05] how many of you remembers when you would
[24:08] go somewhere and they'd say uh
[24:11] what group you in
[24:17] who do you follow
[24:22] see some of you haven't been out enough
[24:23] to run into those type of people
[24:26] but they're out there
[24:30] but you see church what i'm trying to
[24:32] get us to is just like we're talking
[24:33] about israel
[24:36] israel wanted something to do
[24:40] now i told you my definition of that is
[24:43] because then it finally winds up that
[24:45] they said we want a king
[24:47] they looked around at the people around
[24:49] them
[24:51] and they seen the temples they built the
[24:53] shrines the the things for their gods
[24:57] and brotherhood said they seen the
[24:59] nations
[25:02] now this is his wording
[25:03] he said
[25:05] israel was never to have been a nation
[25:12] you need that
[25:14] he said they were the people of god
[25:21] they didn't need to be a nation
[25:23] oh we want the nation of israel
[25:27] organize religion
[25:31] that's what caused them to want to be a
[25:33] nation
[25:38] that's what causes you and i want to
[25:39] join up with somebody we want to try to
[25:41] find somebody that'll agree with us
[25:47] i guess
[25:50] you've probably got a pastor that's
[25:52] dumb as hard-headed as a rock of a
[25:54] fellow that could ever be but
[25:56] i just can't follow what people say
[25:59] unless it leads me to the god i see
[26:02] amen
[26:04] you know i mean no matter how good it is
[26:07] how beautiful it sounds if it doesn't
[26:09] tie together with with the god that
[26:11] saved me
[26:13] well you're you're just trying to be one
[26:15] that's right i can be a one-man
[26:16] denomination
[26:23] then i believe i've tried so that's
[26:25] enough to settle that
[26:27] but
[26:28] see they wanted law not as a law
[26:32] you remember they didn't want a law that
[26:35] told them to go dig 40 foot every day
[26:41] they didn't want that kind of rules
[26:47] they wanted
[26:50] if you don't like anybody else's
[26:51] definition this is the best one i can
[26:52] come up with
[26:54] they wanted a set of rules
[26:56] to tell them they were right
[27:04] that's what they wanted
[27:07] they wanted to be like the people around
[27:09] them
[27:15] and they chose not they didn't want a
[27:17] book of rules
[27:22] they just wanted something they could do
[27:29] do you think that they want it thou
[27:30] shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
[27:36] do you think they really sat down and
[27:38] asked for all of those things
[27:41] something wrong with you mentally not on
[27:43] anything else
[27:45] man don't want rules like that
[27:50] that's why they didn't get what they
[27:51] thought they got
[27:54] they thought they got a set of rules
[27:55] that make them righteous
[27:57] there was no way to be righteous except
[27:59] in god
[28:02] so they chose another way thinking that
[28:04] was god's way
[28:05] you remember the prophet we gave it
[28:07] there
[28:07] sunday where he was talking about
[28:11] it was never god's will to give the law
[28:16] i could just see people in their
[28:19] mouth dropped on the internet especially
[28:21] that and maybe i haven't been around the
[28:22] message a while
[28:24] oh that poor ignoramus
[28:27] the law is god's word
[28:30] amen
[28:34] and that wasn't what they wanted
[28:39] they didn't want god's word
[28:41] they wanted god to okay what they had
[28:43] done
[28:44] or would do
[28:49] what about you and i
[28:55] everybody wanting recognition right
[28:58] i've done that first
[28:59] i said that i saw that
[29:04] and i don't care who saw it first as
[29:06] long as i get it
[29:08] that's my point
[29:09] if it's a revelation i don't care if
[29:11] everybody in the world got it before i
[29:12] did i just want to finally get it that's
[29:15] right
[29:19] but you see what i'm talking about in
[29:20] the natural
[29:22] they wanted things related to the places
[29:24] around them
[29:25] they wanted to look like the nations
[29:27] around them
[29:28] they finally wanted a king
[29:36] you think dayton and court walked up
[29:38] there on their own against moses
[29:42] no
[29:44] they had a group of people with them
[29:47] best i remember the ground swallowed up
[29:49] a good many of them
[29:52] they wanted a group they got a lot of
[29:54] preachers of the day with them
[29:56] because in one account there you know
[30:00] earth opened up and swallowed up 250
[30:02] priests
[30:03] with sensors with coals right off the
[30:05] altar
[30:12] but do we
[30:13] have we chosen law for grace
[30:19] have we chosen our ways
[30:23] as to be the way of god
[30:25] or have we sought the ways of god
[30:32] which way is it
[30:38] you remember what we went through
[30:40] grace
[30:41] the prophet said had already provided
[30:44] them a prophet
[30:50] pillar of fire to lead them
[30:55] a healer
[30:57] a deliverer
[31:01] an atonement to be made
[31:07] i still ain't got offer preaching on
[31:08] that
[31:11] unconditional covenant yet
[31:16] because we think an unconditional
[31:17] covenant would just i don't have to do
[31:19] anything to get it you got to believe it
[31:22] now you take that off of it and go ahead
[31:25] i don't have to believe it well then you
[31:26] ain't going to be safe go ahead
[31:32] you got to believe it
[31:33] it took god dying for you to get it
[31:36] right that's a pretty good condition
[31:40] and remember
[31:41] under the unconditional covenant they
[31:44] had to keep making sacrifices i hope
[31:47] that bore down into your thinking at
[31:50] least a little bit
[31:53] if it was unconditional why did they
[31:54] offer a sacrifice
[31:59] unconditional like we call it
[32:02] so that's what i'm trying to do tonight
[32:04] to look at it as church choosing law for
[32:06] grace
[32:07] of thinking that we're choosing this is
[32:09] the way of god this is what god wants
[32:15] and i'm happy to do it
[32:20] you know is that the way we think
[32:24] what if he comes down and tell us that's
[32:26] not exactly right
[32:29] that wasn't the lord talking to me
[32:32] right
[32:37] because it's contrary to my thoughts
[32:45] see grace
[32:47] had provided a way
[32:50] for them in their life
[32:54] to walk according to his commandment he
[32:57] said that in exodus 19
[33:01] and made them the people of god
[33:06] but they wanted to be the nation of
[33:08] israel and that was never god's will
[33:13] they were to be the people of god
[33:19] well you're going to get in trouble in
[33:20] the bible trying to divide the nation of
[33:21] israel i guarantee you that go ahead and
[33:23] try it
[33:24] because you're going to get where 10
[33:26] tribes goes this way and 12 goes this
[33:27] way and this is unreal this is unsure
[33:29] born this is under
[33:30] you've got a lot of trouble in the bible
[33:33] trying to study out some kind of a
[33:34] nation
[33:40] but see grace had made a way now watch
[33:43] for them there down there whatever they
[33:45] are
[33:46] of salvation
[33:51] right
[33:53] the law never provided one ounce of
[33:56] salvation
[34:00] the law as i was bringing sunday was a
[34:02] record keeper
[34:06] it wasn't transgression until the law
[34:08] came because he didn't have a record
[34:10] keeper
[34:11] it was an individual between him and god
[34:18] now it's a record keeper
[34:22] and they had everything they needed
[34:26] to brought them to christ
[34:29] you tell me something else they needed
[34:32] they had to sacrifice they had the
[34:34] profit they had the pillar of fire
[34:37] they had the healer they had to deliver
[34:39] and all other things joel gyra jove with
[34:42] this can you over all of the jehovah
[34:44] seven compound names
[34:50] and it would have brought them to christ
[34:58] and yet when they got to christ what did
[35:00] they do
[35:01] they killed him
[35:03] why
[35:06] you're a man making yourself god
[35:09] that's what the whole bible had spoke of
[35:11] that would stand there
[35:16] why because it organized
[35:23] right
[35:26] they even had the token
[35:33] what else did they need
[35:39] and it would have finally brought them
[35:40] to christ
[35:42] can i get on down a little further and
[35:43] then just back up
[35:45] brother said look at these pentecostals
[35:47] he said if they just stayed where they
[35:49] was he said the millennium would have
[35:50] been on real quick
[35:57] but he said they organized
[36:03] now why have we been around here isn't
[36:04] it kind of odd that the children of
[36:06] israel was 40 years into wondering and
[36:09] a few years and this and a few years and
[36:11] that and amounts up to about
[36:12] close to 50 years and their problems
[36:14] coming out of egypt and a different
[36:15] thing with the time moses was there and
[36:18] the the time that they rejected him
[36:20] would be even 40 years and
[36:25] in and odd we've been about 50 years
[36:29] bumping pretty close right
[36:31] since the leaving of the prophet
[36:34] of course there'll be a lot of times and
[36:35] shadows when that happened we at 50.
[36:43] why
[36:46] and remember i'm talking to lula georgia
[36:49] not out there now
[36:58] see all the way through the bible and
[37:00] then spoke of the coming of the messiah
[37:04] and they were looking forward to it
[37:07] all the way from genesis
[37:09] constantly they made the atonements
[37:15] but after doing all of that
[37:17] and god telling them how perfect they
[37:19] were
[37:21] they still wanted something to do
[37:27] now
[37:28] like brother branham said i was looking
[37:30] at him one day other day and he come up
[37:33] he said it may be in one of her notes
[37:35] but he said they've tried for i forgot
[37:38] how many years to add
[37:42] anything to god so loved the world i
[37:44] believe it's a scripture
[37:50] he said how can you add anything to
[37:53] the word
[37:58] so now understand what in my
[38:00] illustration of them and then bring it
[38:01] down to us
[38:03] if you had the pillar fire
[38:05] the prophet
[38:07] the atonement
[38:10] all of those things
[38:13] what else would you want
[38:20] god told him just go inhabit the land
[38:24] it's yours i give it to you
[38:30] said abraham has walked all over this
[38:33] land and everywhere he put his foot
[38:36] belongs to you
[38:43] but they wanted the law
[38:49] i hope you're breaking down on one thing
[38:50] to get away from what is this law law
[38:53] law ten commandments that's all it is
[38:55] law
[39:00] i hope you're getting down to
[39:02] understanding what i'm trying to say
[39:08] we're trying to find a way of getting
[39:10] some form of salvation apart from are
[39:13] let me put it in another way
[39:18] what we really want is to
[39:24] heaven help me lord
[39:30] they wanted to be like the people around
[39:32] them
[39:35] and the people around them they've seen
[39:36] them over in front of their god they're
[39:38] idle
[39:42] they were working and
[39:45] slaving and
[39:47] bringing
[39:48] offerings and
[39:50] everything and laying down
[39:56] let me just speak like brother brown
[39:57] would speak about it
[39:58] then you see him getting me look over on
[40:00] another side there rhode is another
[40:02] nation and oh they're just rejoicing
[40:06] they're shouting speaking in
[40:08] tongues that the way he'd say it
[40:19] well this group over here they got
[40:20] miracles
[40:26] okay
[40:28] they got gifts
[40:35] what's wrong with gifts
[40:36] nothing
[40:40] if they're used correctly
[40:43] they're of god
[40:46] but if they're not used correctly what
[40:47] did the prophet say
[40:49] the gifts without the virtues is a
[40:51] stumbling block
[40:53] but i hope you understand what i mean
[40:55] they looked around and seen the way
[40:58] people were doing and they wanted their
[41:00] god to know that they loved him and they
[41:02] wanted to serve him like that
[41:06] thinking that was what he wanted
[41:09] he didn't want that
[41:16] you know what god always wanted
[41:22] and we'll get to it in just a minute
[41:29] as i mentioned a little sunday afternoon
[41:35] you go read the ten commandments
[41:42] and i want you to show me in there where
[41:43] it says you're supposed to love the lord
[41:45] thy god with your heart and your soul
[41:46] and
[41:54] i'd be dyson now and i'm not going to do
[41:56] it but i'll say it in a way how many of
[41:58] you have ever read the ten commandments
[42:04] but what if i started quoting some
[42:06] things to you
[42:07] would you raise your hand that uh
[42:10] and say i sent the ten commandments
[42:19] how many of you believe the bible says
[42:21] that
[42:22] every tub will sit on the song bottom
[42:29] ain't nobody for that
[42:37] see we quote what somebody said to call
[42:39] it bible
[42:46] i've heard people say it's better to put
[42:48] your seed in the belly of a than
[42:50] plant it on the ground
[42:52] i want you to give me scripture for that
[42:59] you can't tell the difference in the
[43:00] seasons except
[43:02] the shedding of the leaves and the bud
[43:04] to the trees
[43:06] i want that in the bible
[43:10] but yet we swear by it
[43:17] how much of the bible do we have as
[43:18] fictional
[43:20] thoughts of others
[43:25] what's been said to us
[43:30] i'm going to jump a little bit and get
[43:32] to something on the point but
[43:38] in the ten commandments the first
[43:39] commandments
[43:40] says what
[43:44] exodus 20 and 2
[43:46] that shall have no other god before me
[43:53] but when they ask jesus in matthew 22
[43:57] can you jump over to number five brother
[43:58] joe wherever who's pulling that part of
[44:00] it
[44:01] being number five on your quotes
[44:03] brother anderson see
[44:08] when they asked jesus
[44:11] what was the great commandment in the
[44:12] law
[44:22] what is the great commandment in the law
[44:29] is it one of the ten commandments
[44:34] that said what jesus said
[44:38] jesus said unto them shall love the lord
[44:40] thy god with all thy heart all i sow
[44:42] with all my mind this is the first and
[44:44] great commandment
[44:46] that's not the first commandment the
[44:48] bible first commandment about have no
[44:51] other gods before me
[44:57] deuteronomy is used six or seven
[45:02] times the same quote that jesus made
[45:06] but my point is it's not in the ten
[45:08] commandments
[45:13] so if we deal with ten commandments is
[45:15] all the law is
[45:16] or the word of god
[45:20] but it is in the word of god thou shalt
[45:22] love the lord thy god
[45:26] what did he mean when he said i'm fed up
[45:28] with your
[45:29] sacrifices and
[45:31] it's become a stink in my nostrils
[45:35] i said i would
[45:37] and listen to a man with what
[45:40] an honest and a contrite heart
[45:45] that's what god wanted all the time
[45:48] he didn't want israel to be a nation
[45:51] he wanted them to be the people of god
[45:55] he didn't want israel to have a king
[46:02] he was their king that's right
[46:05] that's it right there
[46:08] why would jesus come up with the
[46:09] greatest commandment and the second he
[46:11] said is likewise that i shall love thy
[46:13] neighbor
[46:14] as thyself
[46:21] but yet we take
[46:24] in our organized mind
[46:31] and we we organize
[46:33] it
[46:34] and then we'll go to somebody else and
[46:36] we'll say uh
[46:37] ain't it in the bible
[46:41] didn't the prophet say so-and-so
[46:44] what do you want
[46:47] want somebody to agree with you
[46:51] is it going to make it any different if
[46:52] they agree with you or differently
[46:56] if it does you're in bad shape
[46:58] in other words if you've got to have
[46:59] brother call if you've got to have
[47:00] brother dick to agree with you that
[47:01] something's right
[47:03] you got a problem
[47:04] you don't believe what you believe is
[47:06] right
[47:08] you see you want to organize it
[47:10] okay now brother d now do you believe it
[47:14] well yeah i believe william brother dean
[47:15] now do you believe well now we're
[47:16] getting it brother chris hey we got four
[47:22] it says that right
[47:25] but what if it ain't in the word
[47:30] you just organized
[47:36] and you know where i'm going eventually
[47:38] brother brown said organization is death
[47:46] you see they wanted something to do
[47:49] they wanted to be like the people around
[47:52] them
[47:55] and they wound up wanting the king
[48:02] it's the nature of man the prophet said
[48:05] number one
[48:08] paragraph or e46 e47
[48:12] return in jubilee
[48:13] 62 11 22.
[48:19] look what he says
[48:27] excuse me number one
[48:29] probably said number two
[48:35] they called
[48:36] look the church now is like israel
[48:40] and we're not back there he's moved up
[48:41] now he's not back there
[48:43] he's off of israel but he's illustrating
[48:45] with israel
[48:47] the church is like israel when it come
[48:48] up out of egypt
[48:51] when miserable was down there in egypt
[48:52] now here's where we're going to fail
[48:54] tonight
[48:55] because we're going to read about
[48:58] uh
[48:58] the pentecostals the baptists and
[49:00] methodists in a little bit
[49:03] and we're going to look back and say
[49:05] they organized
[49:09] we're going to say they organized he's
[49:11] preaching about them
[49:17] i wonder who he was talking about when
[49:18] one day he said
[49:20] the sickest body
[49:22] that i know of any word is the bride of
[49:24] jesus christ
[49:27] you need that quote
[49:35] look what he says
[49:41] when israel was down in egypt god by his
[49:43] marvelous grace without an organization
[49:45] or anything else he called israel to his
[49:47] health
[49:48] what
[49:49] he called them to their inheritance
[49:53] why they was going towards calvary where
[49:56] christ would meet him
[50:00] he grace furnish them a prophet greatest
[50:02] person filler power grace friends of the
[50:04] lamb sacrificial lamb grace gave them
[50:06] power grace gave them deliverance grace
[50:09] gave them victory grace give them all
[50:12] those things
[50:13] and they danced in the spirit and
[50:15] shouted and praised god about it
[50:23] sounded like a pentecostal meeting
[50:26] but they didn't know that they were five
[50:28] days
[50:30] away
[50:31] but they made their rational stake in
[50:33] exodus the 19th chapter where they
[50:34] accepted the law instead of grace where
[50:36] they turned down god's way
[50:39] to have a way for them their sales
[50:42] give us something to do that's been
[50:44] man's idea all along
[50:48] give us something to do
[50:50] now remember it's been man's idea that's
[50:52] the nature of man adam expressed that in
[50:54] the garden of eden
[50:56] when he was lost instead of going back
[50:58] to god for grace
[51:01] now read it
[51:07] what did he do
[51:08] he tried to make himself an apron and
[51:10] ever since then he's tried to have
[51:12] something to do with redemption
[51:13] when redemption is a free offer of grace
[51:16] my god
[51:17] god alone there's nothing you can do to
[51:20] save yourself god saved you no way at
[51:22] all you can do but man wants something
[51:25] to do into it
[51:29] now why
[51:30] would we want something to do in it
[51:36] okay get at number two
[51:40] this is earnestly contending for the
[51:41] faith that was once delivered to the
[51:43] saints paragraph 67
[51:45] or e-67 57
[51:48] god said i've seen him from the hilltops
[51:51] hallelujah his church's group why they
[51:53] wasn't a nation
[51:56] but god never wanted a nation
[52:00] you say what he's always called him the
[52:02] nation
[52:03] he never wanted to call him a nation he
[52:05] wanted to call him his people
[52:07] they wanted to be a nation
[52:13] they wasn't
[52:14] an organized
[52:16] like the rest of the people
[52:18] now watch it
[52:20] they had organisms but no no nation
[52:25] he said the people will dwell
[52:27] among themselves
[52:29] they'll not be a nation
[52:32] and that's the way the church of god
[52:34] today is a called out group of people
[52:37] it doesn't mean because you're
[52:38] methodists it doesn't mean because
[52:40] you're pentecost
[52:42] it means out of every group
[52:47] god's calling people out giving them
[52:49] holy ghost the holy ghost and that's the
[52:51] church called out certainly it is
[52:54] he's called he calls them out
[52:57] they're not an organization they're an
[52:59] organism
[53:00] their hearts are beating together
[53:02] they're one in christ jesus hallelujah
[53:05] israel started out
[53:08] loving and serving god
[53:11] from their
[53:12] heart
[53:14] but when man's ideas begin to take over
[53:19] they organized
[53:21] become a nation
[53:27] got a king just like everybody else
[53:33] trying to find some way to please their
[53:35] god
[53:38] they started out right
[53:41] where'd he wind up
[53:43] but notice now
[53:46] he said well what's the difference
[53:48] brother dale in an organization
[53:50] and an organism
[53:52] now i'll read you a definition of
[53:54] brother branham
[53:55] over in a little bit what he called a
[53:57] organization
[53:59] but webster says
[54:02] that an organization
[54:06] is a body of persons
[54:09] organized for some end
[54:11] you know gathering together
[54:14] for some end all right
[54:16] but run said it's the people that makes
[54:18] themselves a set of rules and dialogue
[54:22] every how you pronounce it
[54:25] he said like the ten commandments that's
[54:26] what webster says about it when you get
[54:28] on down
[54:29] later
[54:30] a group of people joined together
[54:34] for an organization
[54:37] general motors is an organization
[54:40] there was people got together and they
[54:41] formed a corporation
[54:43] to become an organization
[54:48] churches are organizations
[54:55] but the bride of jesus christ is
[54:57] supposed to be an organism
[55:01] the reason it's an organism is because
[55:03] it is a many-membered
[55:06] body
[55:08] right
[55:10] so then you go over to the organism of
[55:12] the body and you understand
[55:14] the things
[55:17] we're supposed to be a body of believers
[55:20] around the world
[55:24] with a common goal for one thing
[55:30] and that is to serve god
[55:32] from my heart
[55:36] but
[55:37] can we find that today
[55:49] he said well brother dale you
[55:51] you're in the middle of all of it
[55:55] but i can stand here and say i tried
[56:02] what makes you think you're right
[56:06] it's not what i think
[56:09] it's whether or not that word says i'm
[56:11] right
[56:19] you see an organism
[56:21] is a group of believers
[56:24] and that's what started on the day of
[56:26] pentecost
[56:28] back there
[56:29] 2 000 years ago
[56:31] a group of believers
[56:34] but it wasn't long until it become
[56:37] an organization
[56:44] the body of christ is supposed to be an
[56:46] organism
[56:49] parts
[56:50] supplying what need
[56:53] they have
[56:55] to run
[56:57] the body of christ
[57:00] there's nothing wrong we'll read a
[57:01] couple there's nothing wrong with
[57:02] organism or an organism
[57:08] it's an organization
[57:12] now what did brother random say about an
[57:14] organization the problem he said it says
[57:17] i believe this this this this this
[57:20] period
[57:22] that's right
[57:23] he said when you do that you died right
[57:26] there
[57:29] he said when you say i believe this this
[57:31] this this
[57:32] with a comma that says anything else
[57:35] that god will reveal
[57:38] you're an organism
[57:42] is that simple enough
[57:44] i'm supposed to be a deep fellow you
[57:45] know
[57:46] but is that plain sense
[57:49] if we put that period down and say we
[57:51] lula's got it
[57:54] we're the only ones that's got it
[57:57] and you know i ain't never said that
[58:03] but if we do that
[58:05] then we're an organization
[58:12] but if we believe that there is a body
[58:14] of christ
[58:15] around the world
[58:18] that's striving to come to place you
[58:21] know the place god wants us
[58:24] each joint supplying is power then we
[58:26] describe
[58:30] we become the wonderment of the bride of
[58:32] jesus christ which is an organism
[58:45] you see the body of christ then
[58:47] being a group of people
[58:51] we're together
[58:52] because an organism
[58:55] now listen to the webster
[58:57] a form of life composed of mutually
[59:00] dependent parts
[59:02] that maintain
[59:04] various possessions
[59:06] or processes
[59:10] it's good to be an organism
[59:14] i believe around the world today i've
[59:16] always told you that and you know it
[59:19] that there's people that believe the
[59:21] truth
[59:23] i'm just searching for them
[59:28] because i'm fed up with running around
[59:30] the mountain
[59:37] accused of having an antichrist spirit
[59:39] on us because we go to fellowship
[59:41] meetings
[59:45] i can accuse you of having one for going
[59:47] to walmart
[59:50] it's a pretty good organization
[59:56] but listen what does it matter what
[59:58] anybody believes about us
[1:00:01] it's what our goal is
[1:00:07] my goal is to preach the gospel for us
[1:00:09] to be able to walk off of this earth
[1:00:14] and i thank god the way that i believe
[1:00:16] it
[1:00:16] that there's not going to be a bunch of
[1:00:18] old bodies going in the rapture
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:24] i mean i said about walk off the earth
[1:00:31] you see the people of god
[1:00:36] you can't organize the holy ghost
[1:00:42] we want to get back on some more of this
[1:00:43] but you can't organize the holy ghost
[1:00:47] he gets out of it every time
[1:00:51] he was there in the days of martin
[1:00:52] luther
[1:00:55] right
[1:00:56] but when they begin to organize on what
[1:00:59] luther taught
[1:01:01] he just moved out
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:07] and he started to come on with wesley
[1:01:09] and pentecost
[1:01:14] because if you organize you die
[1:01:19] that's why he said now he said the
[1:01:21] lutheran
[1:01:22] church will never come forth again
[1:01:28] right
[1:01:29] he's because it died
[1:01:32] but he said the holy spirit moved out
[1:01:34] and people just kept moving
[1:01:37] people move when the holy ghost moves
[1:01:40] and that's an organism
[1:01:45] well brother don't you think we ought to
[1:01:47] write up a book here at lula
[1:01:50] and tell everybody what we believe i try
[1:01:52] to every service
[1:01:54] you know
[1:01:55] well i mean don't you think we already
[1:01:56] do that
[1:02:02] i don't have no problems with it if you
[1:02:04] want to do it brother mark right now is
[1:02:07] having the clc reason i preached in 82.
[1:02:11] he's having some of them put in the
[1:02:13] book for him
[1:02:15] he's paying for it
[1:02:17] i've never offered to give him a dime he
[1:02:20] ain't never offered to want one
[1:02:22] he done it himself
[1:02:25] he asked my permission i said yes sir
[1:02:31] but you see when they hear that and read
[1:02:32] that they're going to hear me saying
[1:02:34] just what i'm saying right now
[1:02:36] if you denominate this message you die
[1:02:39] if you organize this message you've run
[1:02:41] around says you can't denominate the
[1:02:42] message
[1:02:44] he said but you can organize it in the
[1:02:45] lady of seal
[1:02:47] when you do you die
[1:02:51] well brother dale we we believe you
[1:02:53] preach the truth to us good i do too
[1:02:57] i'm trying
[1:03:00] but we're not the only one
[1:03:05] because if you are saying that then the
[1:03:07] bride is here
[1:03:09] and i don't quite agree with that
[1:03:16] i believe around the world there's
[1:03:18] people that are getting fed up with
[1:03:20] organized religion
[1:03:29] you know
[1:03:31] i felt i headed in the wrong direction
[1:03:33] one day
[1:03:37] and a brother told him
[1:03:42] he said you're trying to make these
[1:03:45] gentiles live
[1:03:48] after a book of rules
[1:03:53] you remember
[1:03:55] paul always stood peter to the face
[1:04:01] see peter proved he had the holy ghost
[1:04:04] because as quick as paul said it
[1:04:07] he shed his mouth
[1:04:10] and later
[1:04:14] he didn't sneak around write little
[1:04:16] notes and
[1:04:17] put it in somewhere you know i wrote
[1:04:19] really wrong when paul rebuked me i was
[1:04:22] trying to do what was right
[1:04:24] later he said
[1:04:27] i have to admit paul said things hard to
[1:04:28] understand
[1:04:32] he said people wrestle to their own
[1:04:33] destruction
[1:04:36] he never said a word about it he took
[1:04:38] his correction
[1:04:40] he proved he was part of an organism
[1:04:45] to be part of a bride of christ is an
[1:04:47] organism
[1:04:57] not an organization he says
[1:05:04] let's go to number three
[1:05:07] maybe we'll try to get a few of these
[1:05:08] things
[1:05:10] submerging church age
[1:05:14] 1960 1203 paragraph 38
[1:05:18] now we come to this samuel they said now
[1:05:20] they come to us this time
[1:05:22] make us or make us a king
[1:05:24] and lord told him that he rejected that
[1:05:27] idea
[1:05:33] and god rejected the idea
[1:05:37] and the lord him that told him he
[1:05:38] rejected the idea
[1:05:41] but exactly what he rejected here with
[1:05:44] just exactly what he rejected here with
[1:05:47] organization
[1:05:53] it's odd brother branham can take
[1:05:56] illustrations and make it an
[1:05:58] organization
[1:06:05] you know that moses when he smoked a
[1:06:06] rock
[1:06:07] the second time
[1:06:13] brother brown said he set up a
[1:06:14] denomination
[1:06:19] and that's why god later told him you
[1:06:21] ain't going to the promised land because
[1:06:22] you sanctified yourself
[1:06:26] is that bible
[1:06:30] just like he rejected that he rejects
[1:06:32] organization
[1:06:34] he rejected them having a king
[1:06:38] well watch what he said he don't reject
[1:06:40] organism
[1:06:41] but organization
[1:06:44] organism we have to have that
[1:06:47] what organization we don't have to have
[1:06:49] because it draws lines
[1:06:52] we are so-and-so we are christian
[1:06:55] i'm methodist or you're christian i'm
[1:06:57] baptist that don't mean no more than a
[1:07:00] pig and a pig pen that has nothing to do
[1:07:02] with it not at all a christian so what
[1:07:05] is it today
[1:07:08] or you're a christian i believe the
[1:07:09] message
[1:07:18] who do you follow
[1:07:20] i follow the two souls the two lords
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:22] proves
[1:07:30] what's the difference
[1:07:35] what's the difference an organization
[1:07:36] back there in an organization here
[1:07:41] you don't reject organism he rejects
[1:07:43] organization
[1:07:47] that's how close this thing is folks
[1:07:50] that's how it is with that quote i give
[1:07:51] you the end our sunday
[1:07:53] the one goes to church
[1:07:56] keeps the book of rules does everything
[1:07:59] the other one does it out of love
[1:08:01] what's the difference in what you see
[1:08:06] you can't see the love
[1:08:08] you see both of them doing identically
[1:08:10] the same life
[1:08:12] whose side would you have been on in the
[1:08:13] days of the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:08:17] and that went on down in your heart
[1:08:18] tomorrow what side would you have been
[1:08:20] on
[1:08:24] what kind of priest
[1:08:30] come on
[1:08:35] watch what he has to say on number four
[1:08:39] how close he gets and what about
[1:08:40] speaking to these people and telling
[1:08:42] them this
[1:08:44] on the message investments 1963 803
[1:08:48] to be a part of me
[1:08:50] and i don't belong to any organization
[1:08:54] once
[1:08:55] nothing but this full gospel man
[1:08:58] and yet it is an organization
[1:09:03] i want you
[1:09:05] and when it becomes
[1:09:08] then of course i'll have to leave it
[1:09:15] now what did he have
[1:09:17] methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:09:19] pentecostals
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] christian businessmen were all of
[1:09:25] denominationalisms right
[1:09:27] catholics were there
[1:09:32] and he said they're not organized yet
[1:09:35] then when they do
[1:09:37] i'll have to leave it
[1:09:39] because it's i it's an organization and
[1:09:42] an organism is all right
[1:09:45] but not an organization
[1:09:48] how close
[1:09:50] can these things be
[1:09:58] organization is what number six we got
[1:10:02] on five or a minute to go so go to
[1:10:03] number six
[1:10:05] summer in church age church age book
[1:10:07] page 251
[1:10:09] this is what organization is this world
[1:10:11] system show me a world system church
[1:10:14] that is full of the holy ghost
[1:10:18] that's what he asked
[1:10:22] i want to see it
[1:10:24] if you can show me such a church
[1:10:27] you're my finding a mistake in the word
[1:10:34] no sir not one of these messengers was
[1:10:37] organized
[1:10:38] either they were put out or out or got
[1:10:41] out because they
[1:10:43] were convicted of the sin of
[1:10:45] organization that were they were
[1:10:46] convicted they were
[1:10:48] they was they found the wrong of
[1:10:50] organization
[1:10:51] they weren't convicted of sin of
[1:10:53] organization
[1:10:54] how can the holy spirit possibly be an
[1:10:56] organizat be an organization
[1:11:00] when it is
[1:11:01] organization that takes the place of the
[1:11:03] spirit and denominations take the place
[1:11:06] of the word
[1:11:07] remember organization is death it just
[1:11:10] can't be any other way if the world
[1:11:12] takes over the spirit departs
[1:11:17] first step
[1:11:19] a little saying a little doctrine
[1:11:22] right you remember this from the seals
[1:11:26] second step
[1:11:28] you begin to see groups getting together
[1:11:32] and following their ideas
[1:11:36] then they begin to say if you don't
[1:11:38] believe like we believe
[1:11:44] you're forming an organization
[1:11:50] now come on church a lot of you've been
[1:11:52] around long enough you've heard them
[1:11:53] words right
[1:11:55] you don't belong to their group you're
[1:11:57] out
[1:12:01] we'll tell you when this comes
[1:12:08] it's death
[1:12:11] but brother dan we're we're lula we're
[1:12:13] not in these churches we're not in the
[1:12:15] baptists of methodist
[1:12:21] you get your coating hat and move over
[1:12:22] here got still the same ideas
[1:12:30] see any idea you have or i have
[1:12:34] that is contrary to the word of god
[1:12:37] is anti-word
[1:12:39] sensible
[1:12:45] and because we can get a group of people
[1:12:47] to follow it it's where we think it's
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:51] now you want something personal swallow
[1:12:55] the reason brother dale believes he's
[1:12:57] right because he walks by himself
[1:13:05] i have been put out
[1:13:11] a lot i got out
[1:13:14] that's why i believe i'm right
[1:13:18] well that don't prove nothing i agree
[1:13:20] with you
[1:13:22] don't prove a thing
[1:13:24] but neither does it prove anything
[1:13:26] because you can get members to join with
[1:13:28] you
[1:13:31] that don't make you right
[1:13:34] come on can i quote brother random
[1:13:36] without being vulgar
[1:13:38] he got into a situation like that one
[1:13:40] time he said prostitution went up last
[1:13:42] year is it of god
[1:13:45] that's the way he said it
[1:13:50] a christian don't have to have nobody an
[1:13:52] eagle don't have to have no eagle to
[1:13:54] walk with it
[1:13:57] they certainly don't need a
[1:13:59] hawk
[1:14:00] it can't fly with it
[1:14:04] god wants people i'm reading it today
[1:14:07] individuals
[1:14:09] who'll follow after his word
[1:14:14] but then with individuals by doing that
[1:14:16] it automatically will have an organism
[1:14:19] in the body of christ around the world
[1:14:25] just because you've got a thousand
[1:14:26] following or ten thousand
[1:14:28] or something following what you're
[1:14:30] talking about that don't mean it's right
[1:14:34] there was one man standing there with
[1:14:36] all of israel
[1:14:38] turned against him
[1:14:42] right
[1:14:46] see a man with the holy ghost walks
[1:14:48] alone
[1:14:54] if you don't see that
[1:14:56] if you can't see that in the life that's
[1:14:58] been before you for some of you close to
[1:15:00] 40 years
[1:15:03] that you've seen the way i've walked
[1:15:07] that i tried to help everybody else
[1:15:10] i went overboard trying to help
[1:15:16] but then it come down i had to walk
[1:15:17] along
[1:15:24] is out there on the internet and i don't
[1:15:25] care
[1:15:26] i don't have a church i can go to preach
[1:15:28] at
[1:15:32] you name me one
[1:15:37] i said preach at it i didn't go say go
[1:15:39] there and talk on a good sermon and have
[1:15:41] a good time in the lecture
[1:15:43] shout out hallelujah
[1:15:45] then a place in the world that i can go
[1:15:47] preach what i believe
[1:15:52] name it
[1:15:58] he said well brother dale you're you're
[1:16:00] saying then you're the only organism
[1:16:03] i don't got through explaining that so
[1:16:05] go right ahead
[1:16:07] i believe around the world there is a
[1:16:09] bride of jesus christ
[1:16:11] and every member in that bride is
[1:16:12] walking alone
[1:16:14] because you see folks you got to walk
[1:16:16] along
[1:16:20] it's not you and your wife it's not you
[1:16:22] and your children
[1:16:24] it's not you and your husband
[1:16:26] in christ as you and god alone
[1:16:35] if you walk any other way then you're
[1:16:37] not walking in god's ways
[1:16:40] but then you take all of those people
[1:16:41] around the world that are following god
[1:16:44] and walking in god's word the way they
[1:16:46] can you've got an organism which is the
[1:16:48] body of jesus christ
[1:16:56] the outside of that you're trying to
[1:16:57] organize it
[1:17:02] i don't call someone check out what i
[1:17:04] preach before i preach it
[1:17:09] he said well maybe york too i might or
[1:17:11] two that's all right i don't do it
[1:17:15] i didn't say i didn't listen to other
[1:17:16] people
[1:17:18] you misunderstand me
[1:17:20] i listen to people i go to meetings and
[1:17:23] i listen and i listen sincerely
[1:17:27] wade told me something today that will
[1:17:28] come up later
[1:17:32] but you see i had to go pray
[1:17:38] he said daddy i want you to speak at the
[1:17:39] next minister's meeting that we'd be
[1:17:41] having here
[1:17:42] i said
[1:17:43] i already knew i was going to
[1:17:46] i didn't even know where they're going
[1:17:47] to have it we didn't know that until
[1:17:49] today
[1:17:50] my wife is a witness i told her
[1:17:53] driving down the road yesterday
[1:17:56] i said if we have one at lula i'll
[1:17:58] preach
[1:18:03] you see an eagle walks alone a lot of
[1:18:05] times
[1:18:08] but then i have to go pray
[1:18:10] and i'll be praying from now till that
[1:18:12] day i walk up here not to have a
[1:18:14] sarcastic hateful attitude
[1:18:19] because i can take the word and kill
[1:18:21] with it
[1:18:26] but if god helps me i can take it and
[1:18:27] deliver to
[1:18:29] i've seen it both ways
[1:18:34] i've always told you it's not me and my
[1:18:36] wife that's not me and my family i want
[1:18:38] my wife i want my children i want my
[1:18:41] grandchildren and great-grandchildren to
[1:18:43] have a personal experience with jesus
[1:18:45] christ as their savior
[1:18:48] not because papa daddy or whatever they
[1:18:50] call me
[1:18:55] i want every one of you to have an
[1:18:57] experience
[1:19:01] with god
[1:19:05] that denominationalism won't bother you
[1:19:07] then
[1:19:10] let me scan through a couple of these
[1:19:14] we won't try to pull them up brother joe
[1:19:15] because it'll be too fast
[1:19:20] i ask you to listen to the message of
[1:19:21] church choosing law for grace
[1:19:24] paragraph 50.
[1:19:25] he said the church would have been a
[1:19:27] church tonight
[1:19:28] glorious
[1:19:30] without spot or wrinkle if the fathers
[1:19:32] would have accepted and stayed with the
[1:19:33] holy spirit
[1:19:35] that god had brought them out of them
[1:19:37] organizations
[1:19:39] but they went right back into it like a
[1:19:42] dog
[1:19:43] to its vomit
[1:19:44] and a hog to its wallet
[1:19:48] now let's move that up a notch
[1:19:53] he's talking about the church
[1:19:55] that come out of organized religion
[1:19:56] except a pentecostal movement right
[1:20:01] come on is that right
[1:20:06] now what about
[1:20:07] the church has come out
[1:20:10] after the prophet brought the message
[1:20:18] come on
[1:20:20] all the typologists oh they're real good
[1:20:22] ain't he
[1:20:25] and they typed that brother branham had
[1:20:26] to go into the wilderness in 40 years or
[1:20:29] something later he's coming back
[1:20:31] to lead us to the promised land
[1:20:35] you know sometimes i wish that was true
[1:20:39] i mean you don't believe it no i don't
[1:20:41] believe it
[1:20:42] i don't believe he's going to come back
[1:20:44] and preach anything to us to perfect us
[1:20:46] right that's right
[1:20:48] if it can't be done with what he brought
[1:20:50] he couldn't come back he'd take him
[1:20:52] longer than he did to start with i've
[1:20:54] always told you what i believed about
[1:20:55] that
[1:20:57] and we're going to have 30 40 days after
[1:20:59] the resurrection
[1:21:01] you think we're gonna be well the lord
[1:21:04] every day it's been raised saw brother
[1:21:06] random walk in the street said when i
[1:21:07] whoop down folk oh
[1:21:09] um
[1:21:14] it's going to be a happy time along in
[1:21:16] there
[1:21:17] and brother branham can go about and
[1:21:19] preach to us for 30 40 days i have no
[1:21:21] problems with that
[1:21:25] that's where you don't take what i
[1:21:27] say and what i mean you want to
[1:21:28] interpret my thoughts
[1:21:32] he can be the first in the resurrection
[1:21:34] in the last phase
[1:21:36] i have no problems with that first to me
[1:21:38] life's life should be first
[1:21:43] i don't believe he's going to come back
[1:21:45] and preach anything to us to make us
[1:21:46] perfect
[1:21:47] because if the message he brought to us
[1:21:49] can't do that
[1:21:50] then he'd have to preach 40 years over
[1:21:52] again
[1:21:52] come on i'm just
[1:21:54] honest he said they went back into the
[1:21:57] hog like a hog
[1:22:01] to the waller in the mirror
[1:22:04] now if you can't sit at church and
[1:22:06] listen to me without getting sarcastic
[1:22:08] or building me up to that point
[1:22:11] you know that's what's happened in this
[1:22:12] message people around the land
[1:22:19] take every one of them doctrines one at
[1:22:21] a time i did to you and showed you it
[1:22:23] come right out of the old organized
[1:22:25] religion come right over into the people
[1:22:28] of this message
[1:22:31] two souls was a mormon doctrine of
[1:22:34] pre-existence
[1:22:35] two lords were just a little higher
[1:22:38] river jordan doctor that jesus wouldn't
[1:22:40] go to the river jordan comes straight
[1:22:42] from the nicean council
[1:22:45] yet you think i'm mad or hateful to talk
[1:22:47] about those things
[1:22:55] but where can you go and tell the truth
[1:23:04] he gets onto paragraph e16
[1:23:07] that's the way it is today
[1:23:09] that's the way it was 40 years ago with
[1:23:12] our fathers
[1:23:14] our pentecostal fathers
[1:23:17] grace had given them a revival
[1:23:19] and it brought them out of the world out
[1:23:21] of the chaos
[1:23:22] that they were in in their formal
[1:23:24] denomination and organization so forth
[1:23:26] and it brought them to the greatest
[1:23:28] revival tomato zeus coming down from
[1:23:31] there right
[1:23:33] pentecostal
[1:23:35] poured out the holy spirit upon them
[1:23:37] fill them with the fire of the spirit
[1:23:39] with a spirit
[1:23:41] they were singing dashing in the spirit
[1:23:44] having a wonderful time and little did
[1:23:46] they know
[1:23:50] they were all years away from the full
[1:23:51] promise
[1:23:56] what about the people setting the night
[1:23:58] listening
[1:23:59] to him as he preached this message
[1:24:05] come on that's who he's talking to
[1:24:07] was he talking about what they were
[1:24:09] what's he doing condemning them
[1:24:14] i thought we read up here that's the way
[1:24:15] it is today that's the way it was 40
[1:24:17] years ago
[1:24:25] but as it was with israel natural
[1:24:28] so is it with israel spiritual
[1:24:36] it goes on to explain where is the light
[1:24:38] it's by faith
[1:24:42] it goes right on down paragraph 16.
[1:24:44] notice but they were all this away
[1:24:46] because they refused to accept what god
[1:24:49] had provided for them
[1:24:51] and they wanted to add something to it
[1:24:54] that's where we always make our mistakes
[1:24:57] is when we try to add something to what
[1:25:00] god has done
[1:25:02] yeah that's the lord's prayer he said
[1:25:04] they tried to add one word to the lord's
[1:25:05] prayer
[1:25:06] all his years and can't do it
[1:25:11] paragraph 17.
[1:25:14] they had to have a law they had all of
[1:25:16] the things the healing but they wanted a
[1:25:18] theological experience
[1:25:21] so they could have something to fuss and
[1:25:22] argue
[1:25:24] and break them away
[1:25:28] paragraph 18 same message
[1:25:31] or e18
[1:25:33] where did we make our mistake
[1:25:37] is it up there okay where did we make
[1:25:39] our mistake
[1:25:41] like israel did
[1:25:45] oh let's change that right there this
[1:25:48] i know ain't asking him to do it in
[1:25:50] there but let's make that we us tonight
[1:25:53] in lula georgia
[1:25:55] okay
[1:25:57] where did we make our mistake in lula
[1:26:00] georgia
[1:26:07] like israel did
[1:26:08] they couldn't get along just getting
[1:26:10] going the holy spirit was leading us
[1:26:12] we had to add something to cause
[1:26:15] unbelief
[1:26:17] to come in
[1:26:24] mighty quiet
[1:26:26] if israel would have went ahead
[1:26:28] following the way the lord was leading
[1:26:29] them within two weeks they had been in
[1:26:31] the promised land
[1:26:33] but they had to substitute something if
[1:26:36] the pentecostal church would have moved
[1:26:38] on in the spirit the way god ordained it
[1:26:40] to go and at all and had already proved
[1:26:44] that he was in it
[1:26:46] we'd have been living in the
[1:26:48] millennium listen
[1:26:51] but they didn't but they did the same
[1:26:53] thing that they did back there as the
[1:26:55] bible said in corinthians another
[1:26:58] example what happened the first thing
[1:27:01] we couldn't
[1:27:03] raise it up
[1:27:05] what happened
[1:27:08] we're in okay the first thing
[1:27:10] we couldn't be go on believing led by
[1:27:13] the spirit in a group of believers
[1:27:20] we had to have something
[1:27:22] to tack a name onto it
[1:27:34] we wanted to make an organization
[1:27:36] tack a name onto it
[1:27:39] where's the other one
[1:27:40] i don't they don't have it now but
[1:27:45] where's that
[1:27:47] and then lost my place on my notes
[1:27:50] we gave it sunday it's on jehovah jireh
[1:27:53] paragraph 61
[1:27:55] jehovah jorah priest in
[1:27:58] 1960 i guess or something i can't even
[1:28:00] read them onto it
[1:28:05] to make themselves some kind of a name
[1:28:12] you want a knife
[1:28:16] i'm a two soul
[1:28:18] i'm a two lords
[1:28:21] i'm a no holy ghost group
[1:28:26] i'm a lula eyed
[1:28:36] no wonder the lord hadn't been able to
[1:28:38] come
[1:28:44] look how easy it is to do it
[1:28:46] so that form what would made it somebody
[1:28:48] got a revelation now watch got a
[1:28:51] revelation that revelation wasn't wrong
[1:28:53] and you watch it
[1:28:55] you ain't explaining that so don't get
[1:28:56] the idea that's wrong watch it
[1:28:58] now you ought to be baptized in the name
[1:29:00] of jesus instead of father son and holy
[1:29:02] ghost that was a revelation from god
[1:29:05] because that was the move of god
[1:29:08] it had to later go on from the oneness
[1:29:09] into the lord jesus christ but that had
[1:29:11] to come you know later on all right but
[1:29:14] they had that name
[1:29:16] instead of that then what happened
[1:29:20] instead of moving on with the
[1:29:22] name of jesus baptism
[1:29:24] they formed assemblies they got to the
[1:29:27] pa pafw pfjc and different ones one
[1:29:31] covenant with a horse other one coming
[1:29:33] on the cloud
[1:29:37] there's where you make a mistake
[1:29:41] there's where you're horribly sin
[1:29:50] grace has always tried to lead us to the
[1:29:52] right thing
[1:29:57] but it's within man and brother branham
[1:29:59] is all even explaining at one time
[1:30:02] he said even man made in the order of
[1:30:04] his making i mean body spirit soul the
[1:30:07] memory reason of consciousness he said
[1:30:09] that made him into a place
[1:30:13] to where he would organize
[1:30:16] because he's always wanting somebody
[1:30:18] with him
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:27] we got more people than anybody else
[1:30:33] what about it
[1:30:39] go down to the last one let's get that
[1:30:40] and we'll quit
[1:30:42] just bypass a couple of them
[1:30:48] should be number 13 brother
[1:30:55] this is off of the message
[1:30:57] identification priest in 1963
[1:30:59] 123 paragraph 14
[1:31:02] 9 through 153
[1:31:06] he talks about a revival of things
[1:31:07] happening you see i belong to my church
[1:31:09] my church is as good as your church
[1:31:15] listen
[1:31:16] i like even this comical i think brother
[1:31:18] adam was very comical in a lot of ways
[1:31:20] he got a point across
[1:31:22] when he said these women said you know
[1:31:24] that stuff that that old manicure they
[1:31:26] got on their face
[1:31:30] don't tell me he didn't know the
[1:31:31] difference in manicure and mascara
[1:31:36] he know there to get his point across
[1:31:40] right he said well i belong to my church
[1:31:42] my church is good at your church they're
[1:31:44] both made out of the same kind of but
[1:31:45] build it same kind of materials that's
[1:31:48] right the building has nothing to do
[1:31:50] with
[1:31:50] organization is a group of men
[1:31:53] who gets together
[1:31:56] make up a
[1:31:57] die
[1:31:58] the count dr lock
[1:32:00] you pronounce it
[1:32:01] of what they stand for
[1:32:04] and that's it
[1:32:08] write up something that you stand for
[1:32:09] look what he even said
[1:32:10] nothing against them that's all right
[1:32:14] listen
[1:32:15] but it ain't what i'm talking about
[1:32:19] you wear the same kind of clothes maybe
[1:32:22] they're decent
[1:32:23] what other believers would do and still
[1:32:26] that doesn't make it but now looking
[1:32:28] here what is it
[1:32:30] it's the spiritual revelation
[1:32:33] of the word of god
[1:32:38] the spiritual revelation of the word of
[1:32:40] god
[1:32:40] is the only thing that's not an
[1:32:42] organization pull that on up let's read
[1:32:44] it
[1:32:46] is that the bottom of it brother joe
[1:32:49] no it's not the end of it
[1:32:52] you talking about a sanctified body
[1:32:55] if you were in that day what group would
[1:32:57] you be identified with
[1:33:00] with the prophet
[1:33:02] with a vindicated word
[1:33:04] although they were in the minority or
[1:33:06] would you be with the popular opinion
[1:33:09] folks
[1:33:10] well i'll tell you i believe that man is
[1:33:13] crazy
[1:33:14] now watch what he says roll it on up
[1:33:19] i believe that man's crazy look
[1:33:22] and the only way
[1:33:24] that you'd ever know
[1:33:26] he wasn't crazy
[1:33:29] come on the only way
[1:33:31] you know he's not crazy
[1:33:33] is for the same god to reveal to you the
[1:33:36] same thing he revealed to moses
[1:33:42] how do you know where anybody's got the
[1:33:43] truth or not when god speaks to you to
[1:33:45] reveal to what they're telling you
[1:33:49] and the only way that you'll ever be
[1:33:50] able to be
[1:33:51] the images of god and the sons of god is
[1:33:54] for god to reveal to us
[1:33:57] and express himself through his word to
[1:34:00] us and us to the world that's the only
[1:34:03] channel for christ was the image here on
[1:34:06] earth
[1:34:08] that you could see
[1:34:10] god in a man expressed image of god
[1:34:13] because god was in him so much
[1:34:16] that they were one
[1:34:18] and now
[1:34:20] when christ left
[1:34:22] he sanctified the church that the church
[1:34:25] might take his place and express the
[1:34:28] word of god see it's the only way it can
[1:34:31] be done
[1:34:33] the only way you'll ever know where
[1:34:35] anybody's preaching the truth or not
[1:34:37] is for you to be in the truth
[1:34:40] outside of that don't worry about being
[1:34:42] confused
[1:34:44] you already are
[1:34:47] i hope you follow the point
[1:34:50] brother rather was speaking about people
[1:34:52] 50 years ago up to his time
[1:34:55] i think we should be speaking uh from
[1:34:58] his time
[1:35:02] up to where we are 50 years later
[1:35:06] right
[1:35:10] where can you find a group of people
[1:35:11] following the message
[1:35:21] forgive me for even saying anything
[1:35:23] about that one ago
[1:35:26] but where have i got a place and i'd go
[1:35:27] preach
[1:35:34] preach from the bottom of my heart
[1:35:37] i can't do it
[1:35:42] and you know sometimes it even gets hard
[1:35:44] here to preach
[1:35:45] from the bottom of my heart
[1:35:59] because
[1:36:02] of two things
[1:36:07] one thing
[1:36:10] is there some of you
[1:36:12] that don't believe the way i do
[1:36:15] yet you've told me you did from your own
[1:36:17] lips but then told others you didn't
[1:36:27] then there's some of you that have told
[1:36:28] me brother dale we can't make it without
[1:36:30] you
[1:36:35] i'm torn in the middle
[1:36:39] because if you make too much out of me
[1:36:40] you're going to put me off the scene
[1:36:43] i've warned you about that
[1:36:45] twice in my ministry it's come up here
[1:36:48] that i was a prophet in the five full
[1:36:51] ministry and i've rebuked that openly
[1:36:54] twice
[1:36:56] because i'm not
[1:36:59] leave me alone let me be what i am
[1:37:02] i just ain't got nowhere else to preach
[1:37:04] so try to put up with me
[1:37:10] see just make god what he is
[1:37:14] it ain't been god it ain't been no man
[1:37:16] except this church said on the word
[1:37:21] it's been god
[1:37:24] not me
[1:37:25] but god to keep his church to prove it
[1:37:28] can be done
[1:37:33] yes i'm shook hands with and hug next
[1:37:35] and call brother we love you brother
[1:37:37] dale
[1:37:38] you're a great teacher
[1:37:41] but where's the invitation to go teams
[1:37:54] and let me stay in the middle
[1:37:57] just don't make too much out of them
[1:37:58] because i ain't too much up here for you
[1:38:00] to look at
[1:38:02] and that comes from a
[1:38:04] heart of love for 40 something years
[1:38:06] preaching to you
[1:38:07] and i've tried to get you to see jesus
[1:38:09] christ
[1:38:11] and for us to not organize like the rest
[1:38:13] and follow some doctrine
[1:38:15] you know what i'm getting at
[1:38:17] we follow a doctrine and an idea if that
[1:38:20] idea ain't truth we're an organization
[1:38:21] just like anybody else that's right
[1:38:27] and that's why we've been here
[1:38:28] 40-something years
[1:38:34] it's because we've never seen what god
[1:38:36] is among us
[1:38:41] and that don't build no man up
[1:38:47] to see god among us
[1:38:51] why would it
[1:38:54] who am i what am i just a christ like
[1:38:57] the rest of you
[1:38:58] the sinner's saved by grace
[1:39:04] but you had a no stupid nuthead enough
[1:39:06] to at least say i'm going to stay with
[1:39:08] the prophet the best i can
[1:39:16] in that way i love everybody
[1:39:22] and i don't worry about it let's stand
[1:39:24] come on brother
[1:39:26] i think we've been around the mountain
[1:39:28] long enough
[1:39:30] i think it's about time to turn
[1:39:32] northward
[1:39:36] like a brother told me one time he said
[1:39:38] lord told me to go north
[1:39:41] he said i come to athens
[1:39:44] stayed there a while said he spoke to me
[1:39:46] again i said go north
[1:39:50] because he got his directions messed up
[1:39:51] just a little bit that's all right
[1:39:55] see he told me to go north go to lula
[1:39:58] he told me this
[1:40:02] then one day he told me he said i won't
[1:40:03] talk to you
[1:40:04] because he kind of like something here
[1:40:06] that got missing you know like an old
[1:40:07] cart that starts missing and then when
[1:40:09] it does it'll finally quit
[1:40:11] you know
[1:40:12] but that's what he started doing and
[1:40:13] then one day he called me wanted me to
[1:40:14] come down to athens to meet him
[1:40:17] i went down there and ate with him and
[1:40:18] he said
[1:40:19] brother i got a revelation from the lord
[1:40:22] the lord told me to go south
[1:40:29] i listened to him
[1:40:31] when he finished
[1:40:33] i said brother god didn't speak to you
[1:40:37] but he didn't like it
[1:40:39] i said because you're out of the bible
[1:40:44] show me in the bible then i said in the
[1:40:46] bible the children of israel went into
[1:40:48] promised land
[1:40:52] they could go
[1:40:54] east
[1:40:55] they could go west they could go north
[1:40:57] but if they went south they went out of
[1:40:59] the land
[1:41:05] ain't nothing to do with me since
[1:41:09] he asked me to tell him what was
[1:41:11] what i thought from my heart
[1:41:15] and i did
[1:41:17] but i become his enemy because i told
[1:41:18] him the truth there is no scripture you
[1:41:20] can't go back how can you go back where
[1:41:23] you come from
[1:41:28] you know
[1:41:31] go back to them organizations where you
[1:41:33] come from
[1:41:35] they won't have you
[1:41:39] i'm just trying to get us right here to
[1:41:41] not sit down and become one of our own
[1:41:47] and move on with god
[1:41:51] well that's all i've ever had quit
[1:41:52] brother 139
[1:41:54] 130
[1:41:58] i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk
[1:42:02] away for the hand of god in all my life
[1:42:07] i see
[1:42:09] and the reason of my blessings
[1:42:25] hallelujah

[1:44:38] we send this prayer involved in our
[1:44:40] sister lord

[1:46:03] it's like it just went amen amen
[1:46:08] what he said
[1:46:10] and he sent his work and healed us
[1:46:14] he said his word
[1:46:16] that's the kind of healing i like
[1:46:19] is to see it just there it is and just
[1:46:21] start
[1:46:23] simply believe it
[1:46:29] i have a close friend who's going from
[1:46:31] chemotherapy
[1:46:34] he's got cancer in his spine
[1:46:37] and
[1:46:38] you know i just wish that
[1:46:40] you'd hear the truth
[1:46:42] you know that god could heal him before
[1:46:44] he went tomorrow to take him
[1:46:46] or i believe that but it's his faith
[1:46:50] amen
[1:46:51] yes remember that
[1:46:53] anybody else
[1:46:57] just pray one for another remember
[1:46:58] brother bob
[1:46:59] we kill him a lot
[1:47:01] he's young and getting started and he
[1:47:03] needs a lot of prayers to help him along
[1:47:06] and he's really progressing greatly
[1:47:08] and we really really appreciate him and
[1:47:11] everything and
[1:47:12] his daddy made a great comment
[1:47:14] there one day not when he was here this
[1:47:16] time but he made a great comment one day
[1:47:19] he said the prophet said you love my
[1:47:21] children
[1:47:22] he said i love you for that or something
[1:47:24] he said i love y'all
[1:47:27] for loving my son
[1:47:31] that's good
[1:47:34] i love you for loving my son
[1:47:36] that's a good point
[1:47:39] heavenly father we thank you we pray
[1:47:41] that lord
[1:47:42] what we said would be
[1:47:44] right and needful and we realize a lot
[1:47:47] of it be misunderstood because people
[1:47:48] won't know me in my ways and my actions
[1:47:52] but they've always been one thing in my
[1:47:53] heart and mind lord is to serve you from
[1:47:55] the bottom of my heart
[1:47:58] all my heart all my soul
[1:48:00] all of my mind
[1:48:04] that's what we want to do a lot of times
[1:48:05] lord we want to talk about you and say
[1:48:07] it's in the soul when it's really in the
[1:48:08] mind
[1:48:12] not have a
[1:48:13] revelation but have an intellectual
[1:48:14] debate about something or a
[1:48:17] theology
[1:48:20] lord we realize that we've been around
[1:48:22] here for 40 something years now because
[1:48:25] we haven't taken what you said by the
[1:48:28] lips of your prophet and just walked
[1:48:29] straight forward
[1:48:31] and called it straight like it is
[1:48:34] prophet said i'll be glad when they'll
[1:48:35] be like it was in the book of acts and
[1:48:38] say you ain't saying what paul said
[1:48:41] well when we do that lord we walk alone
[1:48:44] but yet i'm never alone because
[1:48:48] i know who's with me
[1:48:51] and just helping guide us
[1:48:54] be with the people on the highway give a
[1:48:56] safe journey lord let your love be made
[1:48:58] manifest in each heart and life
[1:49:00] we thank you father for everything
[1:49:02] forgive our sins and cleanse us lord
[1:49:04] lead us in jesus name
[1:49:07] you dismiss
[1:49:12] they were in the upper chamber
