TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I use the video today it says we keep having audio problems with the other some have said that it's a little bit staticky and whatnot on that yeah so we're going to continue our thought on communion uh before we get started let's just go the Lord in prayer and we have I know brother Matthew said he was up all night with a fever hey you know when you get uh when the when the Lord's fixing to do something then I believe that Satan and Satan all always tries to hinder and he'll start um shaking things up right and that's one of the things I want to talk about this morning is how things get shaken up to see what you're gonna do and how you're going to react and to bring you into communion with anything that's right and maybe in a lot of Our Lives he's he's shaking things are getting shaken a little bit but there's there's one in us that's greater than everyone that's in the world God we thank you Lord Jesus are your grace to us God I pray though that you'll come on sing for real Matthew this morning God granted I pray that your leader brother dawn this morning Lord and God gather the doctor's hands Lord and give him strength to recover quickly Lord Jesus and just be with him you give him strength in the sorrow Oh God God I pray that you'll be with Brother Gary and all the other ones the Lord Jesus that are sick and Afflicted and going through trials Lord granted Lord Jesus said to me with the service and be with us a little lesson this morning God that you'll help us to doing something that's wrong amen amen because you know prayer is important because uh if you just stay with your nose in the Bible all the time you you got to you've got to combine what you learned let the Spirit come and Quicken it amen prayers when you get in with that little secret place and let communion with God and let it speak back to you right now so I wanted to start off forward just kind of look at this little picture because the the scene we just read was was Paul as he's describing in First Corinthians chapter 11. communion and you know a lot of times we read through the the verses about how uh about how a woman should have a long hair and a man should have short hair and we we kind of look at that as do's and don'ts but make a read between the lines and look at look at how God is trying to bring us into communion how he's trying to bring the bride into headship with my husband and the angels are bringing us the the the the the prophets down Through the Ages the ministers the angels angels bring us into are trying to bring us into fellowship with God Amen back in the Garden of Eden those four cherubims were driving driving us away from the Tree of Life and now they're driving us back towards it towards the Tree of Life the fellowship with him and real communion with God starts not like that uh that that that that building that that Satan building down through Christian nimrods that starts at the head but real communion starts at the foundation right it's got to start at the feet that's what Jesus said he told Peter if if your feet are clean if you're if your foundation is right then you're all clean you're you're everything's everything's it's it's right it's good to go so get your foundation right get it get your foundation the foundation planning and him on faith where God's faith is given to you and it's it's a faith that cannot be shaken no matter what what the devil throws at you amen it's something that that's unmovable and then you're you're planning on Firm Foundation I don't think in seconds so the Holy Ghost was really uh even before before Jesus began to preach John on the River Jordan he preached this little sermon and he was he was telling the people on the on the river he said I indeed bam tip baptized you with water under it but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly prepared it for him and gather his weed into the garnery but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire now that's what that's what God's doing through the new birth you start off on that found that firm foundation and he begins to roll through you now think about all the things that we've covered we cover the stone that came out of the mountain and it rolls through Babylon it's cleared it out we're talking about the Holy Ghost that is a consuming fire that's purging the Earth and purging to believe her Persian the believer of all unbelief so that when somebody quotes you a little scripture or or tells you something that they heard in the Bible you don't say well is that right or not but you can stand upon your faith believing and that faith will take you yet resting on the written word of God the revelation of the written word of God will is what will take us into the Rapture the fan is in his hand and he's thoroughly Purge his floor Malachi chapter 4 verses one through two that's speaking of the same thing but for behold the day cometh that's your burn as an oven and all the proud ye all and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord have hosted it shall lead them neither root or branch now when you when you look at scripture God has to give you a revelation up because one brother can say well I see that God is going to clean the Earth off and you say well I got it now but then now apply that personally to your old life that you know that God can God get there's there's uh as he you know how brother Brown talked about how when the Seven Seals were open it was like fireworks bursting off there's so many little aspects and different things that you can see as God's word begins to reveal to you so he's cleaning off the Earth but he's cleaning this Earth so that's what I kind of want to focus today you know the the Earth is going to be cleansed but we're our focus and that's kind of what brother Matthew was getting at yesterday is it at the focus of the Bride the specialty of the Bride in this day is to take a body change there's going to be an elect a little group of people that's going to believe God up until the end and just and just going to step off the Earth just like Eno did for behold the day cometh they shall burn as an oven and all the proud of you and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up say at the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves with a stalk now we know how brother explained uh the son of righteousness arrives with healing in his wings yes he's come to give us healing in our body but what's the ultimate goal of the healing in our body to completely heal it and to give us a Rapture to change our bodies into immortality and how are we doing it by eating by feasting on the revealed word of God by growing up as calves of the star a little calf in the star just keeps eating and eating and eating eating on the word that God has given to us which is why it's so important that God sent a prophet in this last day to seal up to to finish up everything so there's no there's no questions anymore there's no doubt it takes away all of that in the days of divorce of the seven of Asia when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hit the glad to servants the prophets there's no more doubt about whether there's there's one God or three gods or or what happened on the River Jordan or or what's going on because the whole mystery of God is finished and now we're supposed to know who God is and who we are and how we fit in the picture and and not just uh like like the have pieces and the puzzle Miss right right now look this is this is one of my favorite scriptures and this is one this is the scripture that brogram read when he was preaching Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen well I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given the mission to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his sight Amen to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ amen the hope of glory amen I believe everybody should have that scripture just uh just memorize and some of you know when you come to my house that's the wireless password to my network so Colossians 1 27. you gonna get on the internet you gotta type that in which is Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery that God is revealing today that God has he came to unfold himself in in in in the person of Jesus Christ and in his bride and now he's restoring eating back and all these things he's that stone was coming through rolling through to restore everything back to take that uh to take us back to the to the original condition and and this is the scripture uh brother Branham also read when he was explaining without controversy great is the mystery of God unless God was manifesting the flesh justified in the spirit singing of angels preached another Gentiles believed over in the world received up into glory and all these Mysteries should be if we're in the word and constantly stand prayed up and studying they should be unfolding to us so that there's no doubt amen because the whole point is to get to bring us in the communion communion is Union communion with God takes is taking two things that are separate and bringing them together whether it's disagreement you can't one can't talk or the other one can't know what the other's all about and he's bringing us together so that we can be one you know and this is a scripture that we all should know Revelation is 11 15. and this just ties into death of 70 weeks and the Seven Seals and and uh the the whole purpose of what God's doing the seven things will sound it right before the third world yeah the second world has come the third world is on its way which is the third world war uh the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven now what's what's the message supposed to do it's supposed to just bringing us so that we're saying the same thing as God what we are we have the same conversation we have we're saying the same thing Adam uh uh when Adam was walking through the Garden of Eden he like brother Louise was preaching he he knew exactly what God wanted those animals to be named he he had the same mind of God and that's what God is bringing us up we can say exactly what he's saying we know what he wants and we say the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever amen now you look at the kingdoms of this world but also all the kingdoms of this world right all the little ideas and things that I had all the denominational things that from Luther Wesley all that stuff has been purged by the Holy Ghost and Fire now so there's the nuns live it's it's being rooted out and blasted away right and remember what Satan's kingdom is the stone tore down Satan's kingdom what is Satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have a light his kingdom is Darkness the inner of his death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom brother Brandon repeat it again it must be good let's be important what is Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the word of God right amen anything contrary to the precepts of God the word of God is not God what is it what is sin righteousness perverted what is death life perverted what is the kingdom of Satan anything that's setting something to take the place of the word anything any teaching one word just one word you might believe every bit Eve believed every bit of it to that one word that one word is all she needed to disbelieve that one word is all you need to disbelieve amen foreign which is what God's doing he's tearing it out he's he's all the unbelief and the guy brother Reynolds said at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being why is that so important so we'll have faith so we can believe God's word when when when when when Jesus stood in the temple and said this day this scripture is fulfilled he was identified himself with what the scripture said you can identify yourself with the written word of God it gives you power to believe you know when when when uh you just look all the all the Old Testament people that went through these little stories and things where God could come down and show them what was written them and you could you see yourself in the word I'm going to show you a little scripture in a second that when I was born again God showed me myself in the world the clarity among the Nations this is a scripture in Jeremiah chapter 50 verse 2. declarity among the Nations and Publishers set up a standard publish and conceal not say bad is taking Baal the confounder which we looked at The Bell the confounder is confounded by the the fullness of preaching right by the the Simplicity of the Gospel Meredith the rebel is broken in pieces her Idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces and Daniel chapter 2 which we read that sauce to the stones cut out without hands we smoke the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break into pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken the pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors look at that now of the summer dressing flowers and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone to smooth the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth right became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors where did Ruth find Boaz what was he doing right he was working away he was busy doing something then Naomi her mother-in-law said under my daughter shall I not seek rest for the internet made me wealthy and now as Boaz of our Kindred when whose maintenance that I was behold he went on with barley tonight in the threshing floor because God's not just sitting by because Boaz you know is a type of Christ and Christ is not just sitting by when when Adam and Eve went out he said I am going to make away afterwards he began to winner get separated he said I'll put enmity between the woman's seed and the serpency and you could say well as soon as he died on the cross it was finished but it's not finished to you right until you have the new birth right now until that until the woman's seed is given to you right is is part of you enjoying inside of your soul you and God together like brother Randall said then you can say there's enmity between the Surface seed and the woman's seed as he begins to win them and in your life right and get rid of all the all the unbelief and all the things that aren't supposed to be there so what what's he doing he's working away and this is a picture of a a man with a fan in his hand winning the barley and what he would do is he take this this uh uh this little fan and he'd fill it up with with uh the the tears and the wheat and everything and and then he he kind of bounce it up so that the wind would blow away all the stuff that's not supposed to be there and it would fall it would blow away now the gospel message is blowing away everything that's not supposed to be there you say well I don't need to come to church you better get in that wind if there's no wind blowing you got to get all that all that chaff and everything yeah the gospel is the the prophet's message you got to stay into the message like that calf is growing in the stall that we just read and and uh and and all those things so so God just imagine God over the last since Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden right he got to work yeah he was doing this getting things back trying to trying to do everything he could to bring us back in the perfect communion with him which is what this type is in Ruth chapter 3 verse 14-15 she laid his feet into the morning ready to do whatever it takes and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the veil of thou has to pull me and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and later on and she went into the City and brother random said that was six thousand years and God was working six majors of barley until the whole thing the whole process is finished and full Redemption is completed now that was full Redemption you've got the Holy Ghost full Redemption is is our bodies are changed we go back to the way the whole process is completed right and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six majors of barley gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter because look when you get the new birth you're not working you're not trying to do something it's not you it's God doing it inside of you that's right it's the power of God it was the power of God to delivered the Israel from the Egyptians sanctification as they cross the Red Sea it's the power of God that took them over the Jordan River right the Baptist and the Holy Ghost the power of God is what will deliver you from things of this world Amen if it's the power of God if they had to come over the Red Sea and still been arming armed with the Egyptians that shows us something's wrong right because the power of God can deliver you from things of this world you say well I I got the Holy Ghost but I'm still going out to alcohol or or any of those any tobacco whatever you want to say what are all those things in the world then it shows uh you're you're going back and you're walking arm and arm with Egyptians that should have been consumed by the Water by the power of God that was destroyed destroyed all the Egyptians in the Red Sea and they came over and kept on their Journey until they until they crossed over the Jordan River amen but that when they crossed over that Jordan River they were resting and it was God that delivered Jericho in our hands it was God that delivered the amalekites and the the all the other tribes it was God and did that they picked up the sword and went after him but you know not one perished a God God would fight their battles right and that's what's what God is doing in the New Birth we're resting in him as he delivers us from our unbelief amen until I knew how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest now see there's a picture we're resting but God is busy yeah God is a working diligently to purify us for the man will not be unrest until he have finished the thing this day right he will not rest until we're until our bodies are changed until until there's somebody that takes a body change and Hebrews 12 24-29 it's Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of April see that ye refuse not him to speak it for if they escape not who refused him that speckled Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speak it from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth and now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and what's he doing he's shaking to get rid of all this stuff that's not supposed to be there amen amen and he's gonna shake the Earth to get rid of all the chaff so we can live on it with him all right and this word get once more signify the removing of those things that are shaking as of things that are made everything that's made will be removed but only only the things that are Eternal will remain and that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved amen let us have Grace whereby we may serve God except to live with reverence and godly fear and there he finishes it that's where we started isn't that good for God God is a consuming fire amen he's rolling through the Earth clearing out everything that shouldn't be there yeah and you're rolling through our lives I see why it's so important that you have the new birth that's right because without the new birth you don't have that fire inside of you to cleanse and purify you right amen and get you ready real comedian now this is the scripture this is after I got the new birth this is one of the first things that God revealed to me and really I I began to see myself in the scripture and I called up I know I was calling my brother Aaron McGee back then I said brother look at what I see in the scripture but uh Galatians 2 20. I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the Faith by my faith it's not my friend by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself so there's just one seal that's right the grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are seal until the day of redemption and that's that that's what God gives you his faith you know to begin carry out all unbelief from your life and then you're sealed in what was the Holy Ghost to give it for this is this is one of the most if you go back and look and you just see the continuity of the message even back in the you know people want to throw out the messages that program preached before the seals and stuff but way back then he was preaching things that he would preach later just by The Inspirations always and uh so many good things in this message what was the Holy Ghost given for you can see the statue of perfect man you can see full Redemption all these things in this message that so I encourage you to go back and listen to it and see what the Holy Ghost was given for that's it what the Holy Ghost was given for what I was talking about is to bring us in the communion with him there's only one way to find out find it there's there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and become like weak or chaff on the threshing floor let that stone the Christ Jesus that stumbling Stone to the world a stone of an offense a laughing Stone a stumbling block to the church but a precious and a low Stone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest resting like Ruth I know that I've passed from Death unto life my soul is at rest and then he goes oh come unto me all ye that labor and every Laden and I'll give you rest to your soul assign this to be evil spoke enough said to talk to Mary it'll be a sign amen and Daniel saw the same thing or rocks took the world was cued out without hands and the whole image of the systems was broke down and become like chaff on a summer threshing floor remember I just read this read down so it it we just got a few more minutes let's kind of review remember we were looking at Nimrod the three things that Nimrod wanted to do you want to set up a kingdom he wanted to build a strong nation which he started from the head of gold right instead of starting in humility from the feet he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished and he said let's go to let us build us a city in the tower whose top May reach unto hell and let us make a name unless we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth because a real a real relationship with God always starts in humility God save me I can't do it on my own man you ought to help me all right somebody was was uh somebody was telling me about how years ago they were in a church and and they remember this this little sister she get up and sing and she'd say I'm gonna make it what about you you know pointing fingers and I'm saying I I wonder maybe if we are instead of pointing fingers maybe pulling our fingers in inwards a little bit and examine our own lives examine our own self and humility Washington one another's feet like Jesus did our example to help one another along instead of instead of judging so much this is a quote we're all familiar with notice again now what's his threefold purpose this is the purpose God's purpose and then prayer that with with nimrod's purpose nimrod's trying to set up a kingdom and God's trying to set up a kingdom and I'll finish in just a second now notice again the what's this three-fold purpose manifests itself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the premise to what restore back you can bring on the back that which was lost yeah the only thing out of it where all the rest of his things was in order God in his body let's be able to express himself in full and so forth as God in a deity through his church have the pureness in this church make us Anointed with the word amen and this is what I kind of wanted to finish on because communion is bringing two things and we just read it first Corinthians 11. as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup eat this bread and drink this cup there's two things that can be you do show the Lord definitely coming back so what did Jesus tell the woman at the well in John chapter 4 20 23 24 the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeking such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in him who be also trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and who also after that you believe you are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise even with your new birth it's a joined together and I see some Sleepy Eye so I'm gonna go ahead and stop here because you want me to be awake for church amen hallelujah God bless you thank you again
