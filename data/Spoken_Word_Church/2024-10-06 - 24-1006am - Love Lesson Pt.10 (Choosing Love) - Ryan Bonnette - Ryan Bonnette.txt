24-1006am - Love Lesson Pt.10 (Choosing Love) - Ryan Bonnette
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and I'm filling in for brother uh brother Bob here this morning teaching Sunday school so the last lesson I taught I've been on this series of Love lessons and the last one was on the Divine Romance just to summarize that lesson basically all I was talking about was to say that there's a romance uh love story if you will going on between Christ and the bride and all the elements are there and pointed out basically you know just to name a few of them this uh longing for a companion hope I have it plugged in good that Christ wanted to be revealed he wanted to manifest himself and reveal himself and he wanted just like a man uh wants to be you know have a wife and you know he wants to be a father he wants to be a husband um just the same way Christ wanted to be revealed in all of his all the attributes that he was so he that was this longing there for that for a companion if you will that was this first meeting this time when you first met the Lord I got that blowed in there that else you can try but anyway there was this longing for um this first meeting there was this attraction and falling in love there we go thank you brother Josh or whoever anyway and then this courtship and communion that was gifts we talked about last time salvation itself is a gift the whole entire Redemption plan of God is a gift to us from God healing is a gift word his word he's given us his love letter if you will as a gift so there's all these gifts the nine spiritual gifts that he gives us and there's also the proposal the engagement there's the wedding the future home the wedding supper the intimacy um you know between Christ and the bride so all these elements are there of this great love story that's taking place and and we're supposed to as we journey with the Lord in this great Union of this romance we're supposed to become stronger and deeper in our love for the Lord that was my point of last time this lesson is going to be on love lesson number 10 uh choosing love or love as a choice cuz I think there's kind of a misconception about love Hollywood kind of paints this picture as we'll get into um this kind of fairy tale image these are movies that I grew up with um of these Disney movies and I don't necessarily have anything against them I'm just saying that the the message they convey is Boy Meets Girl they fall in love love at first sight then they get married live happily ever after ride off into the sunset that same theme is portrayed in books and movies even to adults and it's like that's the end of the story The happily ever after but that's the beginning of the story when two people come together in a holy Union of matrimony that's the beginning of something that's supposed to last a lifetime and actually supposed to intensify and become greater the devil always wants you to stop things you know he's always trying to stop the work of the Lord and sort of like in a marriage when you come together in a holy Union of matrimony it's supposed to become greater but the devil wants you to think it's you're done that's it and then you find out it's the beginning and same thing with salvation you come to the altar you start your walk with the Lord or wherever you met with the Lord and that's not the end the devil wants you to think you're done now congratulations you go to heaven when you die but that's this just the beginning you're supposed to start this journey that lasts a lifetime with you and the Lord so just bear that in mind this slide was in my notes a week ago I was supposed to teach this last Sunday and then uh I got rescheduled because brother Bob couldn't make it you know Tennessee to preach brother Andre because of the flood so this shows you how the Lord works that brother Lis preached this Wednesday tonight it was already in my notes remember he was talking about how when you see something by Revelation you're supposed to grab a hold of it you know and be uh real assertive and not just kind of be uh sort of aax about it God wants immediate action if you love him throw everything else aside and take him if you believe his word cast everything else away and take his word it's a simple decision you have to make up your mind remember I'm talking about love as a choice so make up your mind be assertive be certain be absolute and Resolute that you're going to walk with the Lord and serve him the rest of your days the invisible Union bride he says separate yourself the Bible said from unbelief in the green there you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band of Grace and Merit it of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world s the wedding b band on you there put your name on the book so I'm going to go ahead and I mentioned I I forgot to pray before I start of this lesson let's go ahead and pray but that's the what we're going to be talking about dear heavely father pray just bless this lesson let it be a blessing to your people and and help to all those who may hear it Lord and help me to get the things in order that you want me to say I pray to be a blessing to them in Jesus name amen so keep in mind then we're talking about this whole lesson if I lose you in any of my examples all I'm saying is love is a choice okay this came from I think was an excerpt from the uh Life Bible app it used to be TARTA Bible app first Corinthians 13 and he's talking about what is love love is patient and kind it does not demand its own way love never gives up this famous chapter about love gives us one of the most eloquent descriptions of Love ever written love is a commitment and a choice of conduct that produces powerful feelings you say Ryan I want to just fall in love be swept off my feet and my spouse and I just be like you know on cloud n for the rest of our life yeah Cloud that cloud n feeling all those great feelings you know those come but first there's got to be this fundamental Foundation of real love as a choice that you choose to love that person you're committed to that person no matter what okay it's not based on what they do or how they react or respond it's just a simple commitment that you're going to love this person no matter what and same thing with the Lord when I started with the Lord at 12 I said I'm going to serve Jesus Christ for the rest of my life don't care if I live to be 80 or 100 I'm going to serve him all of my days no matter what I didn't promise him that I just said that I made that determination in myself that I'm going to serve the Lord all my days no matter what it was a commitment it was a choice if you practice the qualities and behavior described in these verses you will experience satisfaction and fulfillment Beyond imagination a great Rich love and feeling of love and infatuation comes from first having a real love for your spouse in this case I'm also talking about with the Lord you can take all these things that I'm applying to our walk with the Lord and really apply them to your marriage it does a really great thing in marriage there is John 15 there's no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends love is willing to sacrifice for the good of others even to death and then he makes the distinction between love versus lust 2 Samuel 13 since he was stronger than she he raped her in Sly amance love turned to hate don't mistake Lust For Love love always involves commitment to the other other person's welfare it has that element of selflessness it's not about yourself it's about what you can do for your spouse and our love for the Lord is what we can do for him Jesus said remember talking about um I wrote this down I didn't write down where it was from but in one of the gospels he says love those who hate you pray for those who despitefully use you so that's love as a choice you choose to love somebody no matter what years ago my dad called me he was upset about one of our certain family members somebody that married into our our family and had um um had caused some problems in our family and my dad was all upset and I was too it was burdensome to us all as a family but I said dad you know what he's part of our family I'm going to love him cuz I choose to no matter what he does I'm going to love him no matter what and sometimes the Lord lets us go through hard times he knows what's best we don't understand we don't question him we just say Lord I love you I'm G to serve you no matter what when we thought IA was fixing to die a few years ago she was so close to death we came to church anyway and uh in essence what I was doing is showing the Lord I'm going to serve you no matter what and that example has been made here by all these so many widows and widowers who keep coming to church and serving the lord though God take away the most important thing to them in this world they keep on Faithfully coming and serving the lord amen so we have that example over and over again in our midst so I'm going to emphasize a little bit about um predestin ation here in a moment because some things opened up to me recently through what's been preached and there again goes back to Choice um by the way if you don't have this book and you're married please get this book it's from I think their name is the Kendrick Brothers they're in Athens Georgia I believe is where they're from but gab and I read this book over you know a time or two and it's it's really really rich um love is unconditional it's a choice unconditional love is a choice God demonstrates his love toward us and that while we're yet sinners Christ died for us how unlovable were we as Sinners yet Christ died for us he did the the the most wonderful Act of love he could have possibly done Romans 5 there in the Highlight the only way love can last a lifetime if it's if it's unconditional the truth is this love is not determined by the one being led but rather by the one choosing to love the Bible refers to this kind of love by using the Greek word Agape which we well familiar with ILO and iros are more responsive in nature and can fluctuate based on feelings Agape Love on the other hand is selfless and unconditional so unless this kind of love forms the foundation of your marriage the wear and tear of time will destroy it Agape Love is in sickness and in health love for richer or for poorer Love For Better or For Worse love it's the only kind of love that is true love that's because it's God's kind of love he doesn't love us because we are lovable but because he is so loving the Bible says in this is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins 1 John 4 if he insisted that we prove ourselves worthy of his love we would fail miserably but God's love is a choice he makes complete on his own it's something we receive from him then we share with others we love because he first love US 1 John 4 if a man says to his wife I've fallen out of love with you it's actually saying I never loved you unconditionally to begin with his love was based on feelings or circumstances rather than commitment that's the result of building a marriage on filio or Eros love there must be a stronger Foundation than mere friendship or sexual attraction unconditional love agape love will not be swayed by time or circumstance so this is a a really important quote that brother Bob made two Sunday ago it was his closing comment on his Sunday school lesson and it was explosive to me this goes all the way back to 2007 there were two doctrines so prominent in the message that brother Dell had presented to us and said this is the one side this is the other side you you know basically he said you choose but um he he made it clear his his stand on him you know when it looks like there is a contradiction in the message or in the Bible it's not a contradiction it's your lack of Revelation and a revelation ties the two apparent different sides together so you see you can take these quotes over here and those quotes over there and tie them together by Revelation I was riding pastor's coattail I didn't have that Revelation and when it came down to it where the rubber meets the road I had to make a decision what do I believe about these two doctrines because it looked like I could see both sides and I begged God for Revelation but he didn't give it right then I had to wait and wait 2007 little by little over the years until now it EXP exploded two Sundays ago and I saw it more clearly than I've ever seen it from this comment from Brother Bob he makes this distinction so important really really study this for a moment from what is the genan seed part two you as an individual you ain't nothing without the word it's the word the Eternal thought the attribute that God thought of before the foundation of the world God knew that one day you would hear that word and the word would drop down into your heart and that would be predestinated eternally he's making a distinction between a sinner and then a born again person okay when the word drops into your heart then now you're caught up into what God thought of and now you continue that along that trajectory so we can say that it's the seed word that comes predestinate eternally but when that seed lives in a person the person is part of God's plan and you're caught up into the Eternal brother Wade calls that genesis6 um and this is my the red there is just something I said believe what you can't see until your faith becomes sight so keep believing what you do see walk in the light that you see for for right now but beg God for Revelation because he'll reveal it in his time if you don't see what I just said quoting from Brother Bob just keep praying and ask God to reveal it and it might take 20 years you know or 15 years but God will show you in his time here's the problem that I see and I'm not condemning ministers I don't think they mean to do this but they kind of throw out these blanket statements of congregation you know kind of mixed Congregation of you know he always was eternal in these quotes from brother bham and and and then people who maybe are still Sinners maybe haven't come to the Lord yet you know start to say well maybe I always was eternal and I just needed to hear the word and word crossed my path and I just came to life all of a sudden you know but you know you're trying to bypass God's plan his plan is repent and start your walk with the Lord get saved get born again and keep walking with the Lord come through sanctification and then you're being caught up to that part that's predestinated because the word seed found you it will find you it can't not find you the word of God comes predestinate eternally to find you it will find you wherever you're at and I'll show you that as an example if I have time brother banon is the one that said this predestination is a bad word for minister to use before an untrained congregation well we're trained you know brother Dell made it really plain in teaching us what predestination is and so we know what predestination is and that is based on choice right the whole thing I'm talking about today is choice you choose God over everything else but make a real firm choice not a one-time choice but a daily Choice every day several times a day every time you open your Bible you're making a choice every time you get down before God and pray you're making a choice every time you meditate on his word you're making a choice and you're choosing Christ over and over throughout your day not just one time I said it and I'm done and I'm going to heaven when I die I've Got My Ticket No it's a it's a daily thing [Applause] okay so question and answers uh brother Banner says predestination is a bad word for Minister youth for an untrained congregation see I don't use it sometimes here at the church but when out in the audiences in the big where everything is piled in from everywhere I watch that word I always use the word for knowledge because predestination is only for knowledge of God God being infinite by for knowledge he knew everything or he is an infinite he knew what would happen so by for knowledge he could predestinate that's the reason I believe God that God doesn't just so he looks at our choice he knew what we would choose and that one day we want it more than anything not that we would just choose it one time but then never come to church again not that we choose it one time and that we'd come to church and maybe try to live by code of rules and maybe be good but that we'd be fervent and on fire for God and that's the kind of choice I'm talking about making so the signs of his coming what is a lie it's a truth perverted it was actually the truth and somebody misquote it made it a lie the serpent um I put that in there the serpent what is a wrong thing it's a right thing perverted everything the devil cannot create nothing and everything that's wrong the devil perverted what was right to make it wrong and if there's a real world real word of God there's a so-called word of God that's false so close to the truth like I said I don't think I'm not condemning ministers for St here and throwing that blanket statement out you always was eternal just believe God you know I'm not condemning them for doing that I don't think they mean any harm by it but for years I struggled with that cuz I could see it looked like they were saying that I didn't even need to get BN again in the first place like I just saw it and always was so there's false prophets as some as there's true prophets but the true Prophet how you mark him he will stay with the word always okay this this brother Dell my paraphrase the best that I can remember how he said this the spirit not something so easy to receive that we just breathe it in paraphrasing brother Dale the Holy Ghost is not something we just fall into nor is it something so hard that one cannot attain to it God's spirit comes by God's process the new birth right right so it's your choice brother Bon says and question answers uh they so they went down in this beautiful Rebecca come out in the water and prayed and watered the camels and whatever more and then you'll notice Rebecca and the final Choice had to come to Rebecca he asked the father for the girl and he asked the mother sorry didn't me H that for the mother for the girl and they neither one could agree wanted to say stay for a while he said don't hinder me on my work and Rebecca had to make the choice cuz he said she is the ma let her make the choice and as soon as it was made her quickly her mind was made up she said I'll go she mounted upon her camel went to meet look the very camel she watered was the camel that packed her to her bridegroom and all of her success and the Very camel the power of the beast in the Bible represents power and the Very power that we give water and praise to Water of Life praise to the word is the very thing that packs us into glory land to meet the bridegroom that's right this is Brother Luis a couple months ago uh June 24th he was preaching on the Lord is peace you're not here at this moment amen just by because by accident and nothing that has happened in the last few years has happened by accident it was the plans of God so we can rest on that amen the vents in our lives are not surprises but they are expected by God because they're what he seen as part of predestination amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm talking about your journey and I'm going to talk for a moment about Gabby's Journey so you kind of take this and maybe I guess you say transpose it to your life and think of how God brought you on the way that he brought you how did he get you here CU that's where I see predestination most clearly that I was a sinner and I was raised a Baptist came to the Lord but I was still far from where I needed to be how on Earth was I going to get in this church even in the message in general how was was I going to get here without some plan of God that the word cross my path and sister gwy Silas would give me a church age book say God sent a prophet and I'd say what's a church age you know and I just started there and started asking questions and probing and seeking God and praying for Revelation Gabby as you see here on the left at 16 about 16 years old her name was Jesse Martin was her given name she was in the uh you know she was a foster kid an orphan if you will and in her journey at the beginning of it she was far away from the Lord just a sinner she grew up in and out of a lot of churches and all those foster homes then on the right you see here a Godly Christian lady that look she didn't just make a choice and just say I going to serve the Lord she sits up till 2: in the morning listening to these sermons from these ministers from Brother Wade brother Aaron Brother Bob brother Luise our ministers till 2 am I'm not saying you need to do that you do it works for you right brother Bob does it working in the yard he used to do it on MAR bus and Mar train you able to weit on the lawn mower now he does it delivering mail you do whatever works for you in your life I have my way it works for me you find where you can meet with God but for her personally she sits up till 2: a.m. listening to sermons she's got to get up at 5:00 a.m. and get four kids ready for school cuz I'm at work all night and most of the day I'm not there at all she's basically a single mom raising four kids herself pretty much cuz I'm at work is that a choice is that fervent is that what you call adamant about serving the lord so she loves this so much she's willing to give her sleep up for it that's what I'm talking about being desperate that's a choice for Christ I'm not trying to make anything of her I'm just trying to show you an example now she that's the end result of where she is today in her journey that God knew she wanted it so bad that she'd do that she give up her life her sleep for this for the message for the word of God she wants it so bad not just a casual choice I just say yeah Lord I'll serve if you ask any old sinner will you serve the Lord I guess you know yeah I'll serve I guess I want to be in heaven yeah I'm not talking about that I mean a real fervent Choice and then over here on this side she's a sinner how on Earth is God going to get her from there to there and he do he didn't sit back and ring his hands and say how am I going to do this I don't know what I'm going to do no he had a predestinated plan just for her catered just to her he knew exactly what he needed to do so he said I'm going to send Arley and Sharon and these message parents that love kids and adopt kids into their home and they weren't wanting another girl they wanted a boy so they came to this picnic one day and I told the story briefly before they came to the picnic where these kids orphans come to meet potential adoptive parents and he they came there and they said we want to adopt a boy they had their mind already on this certain boy so they went they took a picture of this boy they got to meet the boy boy but they also talked to Gabby and her sister Jackie um and they weren't thinking about adopting him they took a picture of the boy that went home and had it had it developed and in the picture was Jackie and Gabby but they were out of the frame when the picture was taken that's what I'm talking about predestination that's a part of predestination where God said my word has got to get to that girl somehow because I know she wants it more than anything so I'm going to get a to her whatever it takes even if that camera has to pick up something not in the frame so they did that they got home they said maybe the Lord wants us to adopt those two girls instead of this boy so they did they adopted those two girls in the middle of there Gabby is on the kind of left Center and Jackie on the right they adopted those two girls they already had enough girls they had PL plenty of girls so predestinate Journey Jeremiah 29:11 for I know that thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of you able to give you an expected end he knows exactly how to get you from point A to point B if you just desire it that's all if you really want it he knows how to get you there but do you really want it do you want more than life itself more than anything more than your next breath more than sleep more than anything you have to really want God it's not a casual just make a choice then shall you call upon me and you shall know you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search with for me with all of your heart and I'll be found of you he how could he not let you find him if you're looking and you're really digging and you're searching and you're seeking what kind of God would just shun you and push you away say no I'm not going to let you find me he'll find he'll let you find him and he'll come and he'll meet you there you just keep waiting and praying and seeking him with all of your heart and I will be found of you say the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations from all the places where I've have driven you sayith the Lord and I will bring you again to the place I cause you to be carried away captive I'm going to close a few minutes early because I know we have a lot to do today so just uh falling in love with the Lord is in the same way takes reading the Love Letter listening to sermons meditating praying Real Love Is by choice it produces feelings we have feelings for the Lord no doubt we have strong feelings for the Lord but that's to me kind of like the side note you know and in marriage we have feelings we have strong infatuation but there's got to be something more firm than that I'll just give a couple more slides here about this um what I was talking about a minute ago beware of uh Matthew 7 beware of false prophets which come to you and sheep's clothing inwardly they are ravening wols you shall know them by their fruits brother the B called that Doctrine you know the what a minister preaches is fruit so do men gather grapes with thorns or figs with thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a crup tree brings forth evil fruit all I'm saying in this is when making your choice about what you believe about Doctrine things listen carefully to a minister and weigh it out in your mind you can't just take it because he's a big name preacher and just assume it's all right and and maybe sometimes we just misunderstand ministers about certain things but uh uh going on down there to the definition of Strong's false prophets is one who acting the part of a divinely inspired Prophet utters falsehoods under the name of divine prophecies these things come so close to the truth uh the musicians if you will go ahead make your way up here please and then from anointed ones brother B said what is fruit the word for the fruit for the season that's what it is their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the Season what time it is man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine but or of God's word of the season when you hear things preached no matter how good it sounds or how how good maybe it's a feel-good Doctrine weigh it out in in your mind and pray and ask God for Revelation walk in the truth because it is is so important to keep right on the truth it's your choice though at the end of the day what you believe and what you follow is your choice and choose Christ Above All Else serve him with all of your heart and the scripture says 1 John 4 try the spirits see where they be of God because and I'm talking about spirits in this case as Doctrine because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confess Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God every spirit that confesses Jesus not come Christ is I'm sorry every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God that that Spirit of antichrist it's so close to the truth just beg God for Revelation and put God first in all that you do I'm going to go aead and close there God bless you thank you [Applause]
