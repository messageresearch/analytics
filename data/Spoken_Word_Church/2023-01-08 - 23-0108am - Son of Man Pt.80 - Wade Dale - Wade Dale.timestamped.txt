[13:18] not made up of Lulu and guildsville and
[13:20] Alto and Baldwin and it's made up people
[13:23] all over the world
[13:24] amen so this is and we you know what
[13:26] it's a worldwide God
[13:28] a man that brings us all together so
[13:30] let's remember them in prayer I also
[13:33] remember brother Joe uh Silas says she
[13:36] wants to thank everyone that went to the
[13:38] nursing home yesterday they really
[13:40] enjoyed it they want them y'all back
[13:41] every month every week and every day
[13:45] let's try months bros y'all let's try
[13:48] months for a little while I don't think
[13:50] we'll need to go up there every every
[13:52] week or every day but but you know what
[13:53] it's it's a it's a Ministry
[13:56] it's a Ministry just like this is
[13:58] Ministry it helps people it's a conduit
[14:00] that God can get to the uh to the older
[14:03] ones ones that are shut in ones that
[14:05] their family won't even go see them
[14:06] anymore sadly
[14:08] and that we can give them just a little
[14:10] bit of sunshine
[14:12] in their life one day maybe out of the
[14:14] month right so remember that well
[14:16] remember the mission trip we're going to
[14:18] pray this afternoon out or today after
[14:20] the first service have all of them come
[14:22] up brother Michael
[14:23] sister Nyla says Jordan
[14:26] and Bob and Louise's family we're going
[14:29] to come up and have prayer
[14:31] for you before you leave amen I believe
[14:33] in prayer amen I believe in going to the
[14:36] Lord in prayer just remember that
[14:37] mission trip
[14:38] coming up they'll be leaving on
[14:40] Wednesday the 11th and be back on the
[14:43] 23rd I think it is
[14:45] 23rd which will be a Monday all right so
[14:48] just remember them in prayer and like I
[14:52] said this afternoon's offering to go to
[14:54] them too plus the church is going to
[14:55] give them some extra so just remember
[14:58] that by way of announcement again uh if
[15:00] you can't see it but that window back
[15:03] there where the media room is it's been
[15:05] insulated a little bit because and I've
[15:08] been guilty of it myself the media room
[15:10] doesn't need to be a place to joke talk
[15:12] or cut up because you can hear it out
[15:15] here in the sanctuary all right so if we
[15:17] have anything personal to say we need to
[15:19] step outside going the other Sunday
[15:20] school class or what more that needs to
[15:23] be left
[15:24] to
[15:26] um I know brother
[15:28] Joe sometimes gets aggravated because
[15:30] and we all do they get so full there's
[15:32] no way to do your job so let's just stay
[15:34] out of there if you're not part of the
[15:36] media room then just kind of stay out of
[15:38] there and let them do their job and they
[15:41] do a wonderful job amen
[15:43] yes
[15:44] they do a wonderful job they get this
[15:47] message around the world people are
[15:49] streaming in now and then they'll be
[15:50] watching online you just don't know who
[15:53] you're going to affect
[15:55] amen
[15:57] so we thank God for them
[16:00] all right also brother Aaron to be
[16:02] speaking for us Wednesday
[16:05] um
[16:06] we will have a prayer service next
[16:09] Saturday at seven o'clock next Saturday

[16:13] meeting where only then we'll be a
[16:15] couple weeks away from the youth service
[16:18] which will be not the third Saturday
[16:20] this month it'll be the fourth Saturday
[16:22] because some of our youth are going to
[16:24] be gone so we're going to have it on the
[16:26] 28th and 29th brother Daryl Ward will be
[16:30] with us that whole weekend all right so
[16:32] let's keep that in prayer we'll have
[16:33] prayer meeting on the 14th at seven
[16:36] o'clock and I know most of you do know
[16:38] that there is a wedding coming up on

[16:43] and on March the 24th you'll everything
[16:46] you need to know is downstairs on the

[16:51] a Monica that they need to
[16:53] nothing else they need to okay just read
[16:55] that and and RSVP accordingly you can do
[16:58] it online and it would be a
[17:01] good thing for you too sign up early
[17:04] still don't know who's coming also the
[17:06] Valentine's banquet will be February the
[17:08] 11th and we need to know who's coming
[17:10] and who's bringing do we have a list
[17:12] back there yet though Lisa forgot it
[17:16] she has so much to do what you want
[17:18] somebody else to do it
[17:20] you got it okay all right I mean she
[17:22] she's just got she's got so many hands
[17:25] she's like an octopus sure she needs to
[17:26] be one well this is going everywhere but
[17:29] we appreciate Sister Lisa but there'll
[17:31] be a list downstairs for you to sign up
[17:33] and to sign up the people that you're
[17:36] bringing and brother Dutch got to be
[17:38] with us that weekend to preach for us
[17:41] and to be there on February 11th all
[17:43] right one more thing most of you know
[17:44] June was going to have surgery a couple
[17:47] weeks from now which will be the 18th
[17:48] for a hysterectomy but that has been
[17:50] canceled because she's going to have
[17:53] shoulder surgery
[17:54] Wednesday right and I can't change my
[17:58] schedule so I probably won't be there so
[18:01] I need y'all to kind of pitch in and see
[18:04] if she needs anything all right and I
[18:06] know you will so I don't have to say any
[18:07] more about it I'm going to try to get
[18:09] back my flight gets back in at 12
[18:11] o'clock Wednesday so we'll try to be
[18:13] back for that but she needs a touch from
[18:15] the Lord for her shoulder and The
[18:17] Guiding of the operator's hands that
[18:20] it'll all come out just right because
[18:22] they were talking about total shoulder
[18:25] replacement surgery last week
[18:27] that's the only thing you can do total
[18:29] shoulder replacement surgery and then
[18:31] they came back a few days later and said
[18:33] no I talked to a colleague and we think
[18:36] we can put that thing back together for
[18:37] you so we just we just rotator cuff and
[18:39] I've had it too and uh it's it's just
[18:42] something that the muscles won't ever
[18:43] attach unless you
[18:45] help them a little bit so thank God for
[18:47] doctors that help us amen so let's just
[18:50] remember that in prayer let's go to the
[18:51] Lord in prayer as we stand here today
[18:55] Lord Jesus
[18:57] we love you so much Lord
[18:59] there's a part of us Lord that
[19:03] Longs for home
[19:05] but there's also a part of us that knows
[19:08] that there's more work to be done
[19:10] their souls to be brought into the
[19:12] kingdom there's there's the Bride of
[19:15] Jesus Christ to to mature into a wife
[19:18] and
[19:19] and Lord come to full maturity and get
[19:22] away from the milk and and start eating
[19:24] meat

[19:29] now in the furthermore this service that
[19:30] we may
[19:31] have some meat Lord
[19:33] your word is so full of promises
[19:36] and it you promised that if two or three
[19:38] are gathered in your name that you would
[19:40] be in the myth so Lord all these
[19:43] requests you've heard all the things
[19:44] that we're doing for the coming up year
[19:46] and the ones that are going on a trip
[19:48] Lord we pray that you would sanctify
[19:50] them Lord that means clean them and set
[19:52] them aside and then put them in service
[19:53] Lord
[19:54] for all of us Lord I pray that we'll
[19:56] bind ourselves together more each one
[19:58] that has a position in this church Lord
[20:00] I pray that we would come to a full
[20:02] statue of a perfect man Lord so that we
[20:04] can as the prophet said lead others into
[20:07] that same path father thank you for the
[20:09] visitors that are among us we pray that
[20:12] you'd bless them today Lord be with the
[20:14] ones Lord that are sick there's many
[20:15] that's out today with covet and
[20:17] different things Lord we pray that you'd
[20:19] rebuke that devil and Lord that you
[20:22] would heal them and bring them up Lord
[20:23] for your honor and Glory father just
[20:25] give us this day our daily bread in
[20:27] Jesus name we pray
[20:28] amen
[20:30] like my dad always says
[20:34] Logan and Angela you're not going to get
[20:36] greeted again because you're just part
[20:38] of us the next time you come to service
[20:39] so don't think we're going to call your
[20:41] name again okay don't be so embarrassed
[20:43] nope
[20:45] your face stay red like that a lot
[20:47] you need to check your blood pressure
[20:48] all right let's go to Son of Man part 80
[20:51] but it's good to have you here on the
[20:53] front row if you come with Donnie you're
[20:54] gonna sit on the front row you ain't
[20:55] gonna step back under you're gonna set
[20:56] up there
[20:57] Donnie gonna lead you I'm gonna lead you
[20:59] to the front be like his daddy you good
[21:01] up front boy
[21:04] so let's read in the beginning was the
[21:06] word
[21:06] and the Word was with God
[21:09] and the Word was God
[21:10] and the Word was made flash so this word
[21:13] that we've all we know what a Bible is
[21:16] right
[21:17] most Mo the the highest selling book in
[21:20] the world is the Bible but do they
[21:22] really know the author of The Bible do
[21:25] they really know that those words
[21:26] written on there are going to become
[21:28] flesh in a in a group of people
[21:30] especially in the end time that's going
[21:33] to take this and give it to the people
[21:35] and we're going to take a body change
[21:37] we're going to get out of here there's
[21:39] something that we're that we're heading
[21:41] toward and I appreciate that look the
[21:43] world's heading towards something
[21:44] so why can't we be heading towards
[21:47] something
[21:48] they're heading toward destruction
[21:50] you and I are heading toward Rapture
[21:51] amen
[21:53] like what somebody said the other day
[21:55] they said you know you look in the Bible
[21:56] you see that there's Eagles and then
[21:58] there's buzzards the Eagles go up the
[22:01] buzzards eat the people that are here so
[22:03] which which dinner do you want to go to
[22:06] think about that for a minute and the
[22:08] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[22:10] and we beheld his glory to go the only
[22:11] begotten of the father we believe it's
[22:13] here today right we believe you brought
[22:15] a piece of him with you
[22:17] so there we are full of grace and truth
[22:20] proverbs 31 10 says who can find a
[22:23] virtuous woman for her price is far
[22:25] above rubies you may be seated in the
[22:27] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[22:29] the word
[22:31] who can find a virtuous woman that's
[22:33] what we're going to try to background a
[22:35] little bit because we do have some
[22:36] visitors here in background just a
[22:37] minute on on this we're not now now we
[22:40] always want to
[22:43] um
[22:44] be diligent in telling our sisters and
[22:46] our brothers to stay virgins until
[22:49] you're married all right stay there
[22:51] strive do the best you can and then give
[22:54] everything you've got to that man or
[22:55] woman that that you're getting ready to
[22:57] marry all right
[22:59] and and if you don't then you know just
[23:02] pray to God that everybody else coming
[23:05] up would hold their self
[23:07] to a place that who can find this is
[23:10] this is Solomon talking about his mother
[23:13] who can find a virtuous woman for a
[23:16] price as far above rubies this is
[23:18] Solomon that had so much gold you
[23:20] couldn't even count it
[23:22] so much gold I mean the Vatican ain't
[23:24] got anything in Solomon
[23:26] Solomon had all brother Brown said
[23:28] richest country richest man richest king
[23:31] that ever was
[23:33] and he says that if you can find one
[23:35] virtuous woman her price is far above
[23:39] rubies all right now in Genesis 2 9 now
[23:41] we're going to talk about a little this
[23:43] afternoon I hope we get to it on
[23:45] knowledge now remember when we we talked
[23:47] a little bit Wednesday night about
[23:48] knowledge you're going to have to pull
[23:50] knowledge apart
[23:53] because there's Holy Ghost knowledge
[23:55] and there's Satan's knowledge
[23:58] all right right here they are right here
[24:00] in the Book of Genesis and out of the
[24:02] ground Genesis 2 9 may the Lord God to
[24:05] grow every tree that's Pleasant to the
[24:07] site and good for food now stop
[24:09] that's natural food that's that's apples
[24:12] oranges pears whatever that grows on a
[24:16] tree now nuts fruits and all that is
[24:18] everybody with me now these two trees
[24:20] he's fixing to talking about talk about
[24:22] here they're not natural trees
[24:25] all right because there's that little
[24:27] pause to stop he says the tree of life
[24:31] also in the midst of the Garden or in
[24:33] the middle
[24:34] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[24:36] Evil so there's two trees there one of
[24:38] them
[24:39] God told if you eat off this tree you'll
[24:41] live if you eat off this tree you're
[24:43] going to die all right so there's no in
[24:45] between you're eating off today you've
[24:48] walked into this church and you're
[24:49] eating off one of the two now I know for
[24:52] a fact that you and I have to look and
[24:55] well you drove in on a tree of knowledge
[24:57] of Good and Evil
[25:01] most of y'all ain't got in your hand
[25:03] right now a lot of people
[25:06] your cell phone
[25:09] well get quiet on me would you
[25:12] but that's where it come from
[25:14] but well you know what God is so much
[25:16] smarter than Satan he'll just let Satan
[25:18] just bring all this out and then he'll
[25:20] just use it
[25:22] right for the glory and honor or the
[25:23] Lord he'll just use it for you to call
[25:25] and pray for somebody or text somebody
[25:27] hey I'm praying for you I appreciate you
[25:29] I love you and then people can say hey
[25:30] please pray for me where you don't have
[25:32] to get on the phone and do it you know
[25:33] 30 or 40 times you just throw a little
[25:35] WhatsApp out there or or Marco Polo and
[25:38] and you can uh you can get to a lot of
[25:41] people that can start praying really
[25:42] fast and we appreciate that so so Satan
[25:46] slipped into God's Eden but you know
[25:47] what
[25:48] God slipped right into Satan's Eden
[25:52] and started using what he's already had
[25:54] off that tree of knowledge of Good and
[25:56] Evil to what to help us eat off the tree
[25:59] of life because who is the tree of life
[26:00] not a tree remember it's not bark and
[26:03] Roots it's Jesus Christ he's a rude and
[26:06] offspring of David a root that comes out
[26:08] of the stem of Jesse amen a branch he's
[26:11] talked about many many times of being a
[26:13] tree and that's why they have they hung
[26:15] him on a tree right because he was the
[26:17] tree of life so Isaiah 28 9 says Whom
[26:21] Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall
[26:23] he make to understand Doctrine who
[26:26] then that are weaned from the milk
[26:29] and drawn from the breast
[26:32] all right now I had a little milk this
[26:33] this morning with my toast and egg
[26:37] but I'm gonna have that again this
[26:39] afternoon
[26:40] I'm gonna have some sweet tea and some
[26:42] Brunswick stew got a lot of meat in it
[26:46] that was good last night that wedding we
[26:48] were out so anyway y'all can watch us
[26:50] eat it
[26:51] um
[26:52] Isaiah 53
[26:54] now watch look
[26:56] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him we
[26:58] know who this is talking about talk
[26:59] about Jesus Christ he has put him to
[27:01] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[27:03] offering for sin his soul the real being
[27:06] of himself all right he shall see his
[27:08] seed which was his progeny his children
[27:12] all right he shall prolong his days and
[27:14] the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
[27:16] in his hand he shall see of the travail
[27:19] of his soul and shall be satisfied by
[27:23] his knowledge
[27:25] shall my righteous servant justify many
[27:27] so there's not anything wrong with God's
[27:29] knowledge because we're going to have to
[27:31] look at knowledge on the pyramid and
[27:33] that has nothing to do with God's
[27:34] knowledge
[27:36] the knowledge of God Is So opposite of
[27:39] Science and all this out in the world
[27:41] until it's just night and day difference
[27:44] but sometimes man can't tell the
[27:46] difference between the two because the
[27:48] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's
[27:50] so enticing
[27:51] and so go it's just beautiful you know
[27:54] Jesus wasn't very beautiful when he was
[27:56] hanging on the cross but he was saving
[27:57] your soul and my soul amen by his
[28:00] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[28:01] justify many for he shall bear their
[28:04] iniquities now how are we going to see
[28:06] that we Bob was talking about this
[28:07] morning
[28:09] there is one truth there is not a truth
[28:12] there is one truth and it is Jesus
[28:15] Christ
[28:16] Thy word is true this Bible is true
[28:18] there's not anything in here that's
[28:20] wrong there's not an error in it there's
[28:22] not a denomination in it there's not 14
[28:24] 000 different ideas in it
[28:27] but man off the tree of knowledge of
[28:30] Good and Evil has been eaten and he has
[28:32] been eating to what to discredit this
[28:35] right here and I say man I say Satan
[28:37] through man
[28:39] listen you don't come up with ideas of
[28:42] your own you're influenced and then you
[28:44] make a decision everybody with me you
[28:47] you are influenced and then you make a
[28:49] decision all right so what are we going
[28:52] to do we're gonna we're gonna the Bible
[28:54] even tells us this try the spirits
[28:57] try the word
[28:59] come and see taste and see that the Lord
[29:02] is good you can eat off the world's tree
[29:04] or you can eat off eat off God's tree
[29:05] one of the two all right but he says
[29:08] sanctify them who's them us
[29:10] through thy truth Thy word is truth as
[29:13] thou has sent me into the world so even
[29:15] I also sent them into the world God
[29:17] didn't save us and put us in the Bible
[29:18] and say all right you stay right here
[29:21] he said so let your light shine among
[29:24] men
[29:25] shine among men that's right
[29:29] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[29:31] Jesus Christ talking about himself that
[29:34] they also might be Sanctified what
[29:36] through
[29:39] a truth
[29:40] through the truth
[29:43] all right now we know that for the ones
[29:45] that's that's just here today
[29:47] sanctification we know that word
[29:50] we've always called it sanctification
[29:53] but really it's a compound word that
[29:55] means you're you're cleaning something
[29:57] up
[29:59] and you're putting it aside for service
[30:00] you're not putting it in service yet
[30:02] it's like it's like washing the washing
[30:05] the glass the glass was dirty and felt
[30:08] in and like you in the world and God
[30:10] picked you up out of the out of the mud
[30:11] he justified you he said I'm going to
[30:13] use this glass I'm going to use this
[30:15] person
[30:16] but you're still really dirty inside you
[30:19] got mud in you you got sticks and you
[30:21] got all these different things but then
[30:23] God takes you by the washing of the
[30:25] water of the word come to church
[30:26] come to church and let the what let
[30:28] brother Brown say get them under the
[30:30] fountain
[30:31] what is the Fountain and that's not it's
[30:33] a fountain coming from that tree of life
[30:36] a fountain flowing with living water
[30:39] that's what Jesus said I'll give you
[30:41] living water you don't worry about this
[30:42] whale I'm going to give you something
[30:43] that'll never run dry
[30:46] so what is he doing that means that he
[30:48] takes that word and washes us cleans us
[30:51] up cleans the glass and he didn't want
[30:54] to drink out of it yet he's going to put
[30:56] it here and then he's going to decide
[30:58] what he's going to do with it
[31:00] everybody with me he's going to decide
[31:02] what to do with this glass
[31:04] he's either gonna
[31:07] let it
[31:09] fall back into the dirt
[31:12] because remember still your free moral
[31:14] agency
[31:15] you fall right back into the dirt and
[31:17] you get all covered with mud again
[31:18] because remember the unclean Spirit goes
[31:20] out
[31:21] of a man walks in dry places seek a
[31:23] thrift finders none cometh back and
[31:25] brings more mud
[31:28] brings more sticks brings more junk of
[31:31] the world and then the person is seven
[31:33] times worse than he started but if
[31:36] you'll get yourself Sanctified cleaned
[31:38] up and set aside for service then what's
[31:41] going to happen is God's gonna come into
[31:42] your soul and he's going to what he's
[31:44] going to cap it off or seal it off so
[31:47] that it won't get out
[31:48] all right this can get out now look
[31:52] um
[31:54] but when I close it up it won't
[31:56] that's what God wants to do to give you
[31:58] the Holy Ghost he wants to drive the
[32:01] unclean Spirit out that's why we don't
[32:03] act like the world
[32:04] listen we don't we should we should not
[32:06] even think like the world
[32:09] they're thinking to do this and thinking
[32:11] to do that and thinking to smoke and
[32:13] drink and curse and do all the different
[32:14] things that's what they're thinking
[32:15] that's their motive and objective it's
[32:18] what the God of this evil age they're
[32:20] ready today this Sunday
[32:22] we got ready to go to church they got
[32:24] ready to play football
[32:29] they put their favorite hat on they put
[32:31] their favorite uh jacket on some of them
[32:34] didn't put on nothing at all because
[32:36] they're gonna they're gonna tape their
[32:38] favorite
[32:39] football team over around on their chest
[32:41] and get shown on ESPN
[32:44] that's what the world thought we've
[32:45] never nothing I I hope none of y'all
[32:47] ever thought that but if you did your
[32:50] doctor's open
[32:54] I come on Sunday to listen to the word
[32:56] of God it's not a day that all everybody
[32:58] plays football
[33:00] and that I enjoyed that part
[33:02] all right
[33:05] I said I wasn't going to do it but I'm
[33:07] going to say it anyway
[33:10] I get in trouble so I'm gonna say it
[33:11] anyway
[33:12] I looked the other day you know Georgia
[33:14] won the SEC Championship you know
[33:16] remember one point you know so I did
[33:18] watch the game uh later we were here I
[33:21] watched it afterwards
[33:23] so
[33:25] they showed a little snippet the next
[33:27] two or three days on YouTube of people
[33:29] in their room in their house and they
[33:31] were videoing it with their
[33:33] boy's shaking his head and Terence is
[33:35] too I think you know they're they're
[33:36] they're they're they're in their living
[33:38] room and everybody's glued to the
[33:39] television and as soon as that field
[33:42] goal was missed
[33:44] where Georgia beats Ohio State
[33:49] I'm not taking anything red with me up
[33:51] there I'm going to Ohio tonight so I'm
[33:52] not going to take anything red I don't
[33:54] want to get shot
[33:55] so uh
[33:58] so anyway we're just human beings
[34:02] but you see those people there they're
[34:04] anticipating something
[34:06] kind of like you are now you're
[34:07] anticipating something
[34:09] but buddy as soon as that guy from Ohio
[34:11] State hooked that field goal and Georgia
[34:13] won
[34:15] I wish some of y'all would act like that
[34:19] we'd at least would really have to clean
[34:21] up then
[34:24] they were throwing stuff beating each
[34:26] other up jumping over couches
[34:29] for a ball game
[34:31] why can't we do that for the spirit of
[34:33] God
[34:34] and let God have his way one day and let
[34:37] us do that let us be under anticipation
[34:40] and be sitting there under anticipation
[34:42] Hey listen you got to be watching the
[34:44] game
[34:45] to know what happened you got to be in
[34:47] church you got to know what you're doing
[34:48] with the word of God to be happy about
[34:50] when some incident happens that what the
[34:53] emotion just starts flowing right all
[34:55] right
[34:56] and and it did with them and it just I
[34:59] mean if you well look at that you go
[35:00] these people are crazy
[35:03] they're just idiots but that's the way
[35:04] we acted when we were out in the world
[35:06] we did the same identical thing all
[35:08] right
[35:09] jump up and down let's jump up and down
[35:11] for Jesus let's get something a little
[35:12] bit Eternal on our mind all right but
[35:16] what does God tell us I'm moving right
[35:17] along I'm just I'm assuming
[35:21] what was the whole deal it was obeying
[35:24] what God Said to do
[35:25] which brought our power it brings our
[35:27] power now
[35:29] is doing what obeying what God Said to
[35:31] do what brought virtue is obedience to
[35:35] the word of God
[35:36] all right now look we know and we we
[35:39] don't uh know if our brothers talked to
[35:40] brother Donnie much but we believe God
[35:42] in the end time sent us a prophet he
[35:44] sent us somebody and people have a
[35:46] problem with prophets I don't because
[35:48] the Bible's full of them Paul was one
[35:50] Peter James John all the different ones
[35:53] uh job Isaiah
[35:57] um all the ones in the Bible Paul they
[35:59] were all prophets and they have no world
[36:00] has no problem with them because they're
[36:02] they're way back younger
[36:04] but when you get in their face and tell
[36:06] them God sent a prophet according to
[36:08] Malachi 4 according to Luke 17 30 and he
[36:11] was Vindicated to take this Bible and
[36:14] give us the truth not a truth
[36:16] not 70 different translations or 7 000
[36:19] different translations one translation
[36:22] all right so we believe and that's why
[36:24] we quote him because we believe as
[36:26] others quote Charles Stanley as others
[36:28] quote nothing wrong with these guys as
[36:30] others quote John Hagee and the
[36:32] different ones McCarthy Oh They'll quote
[36:34] them all day long Spurgeon they'll put
[36:35] it up on the screen they'll quotes
[36:37] Persian and which are great men
[36:41] but they didn't all have the truth
[36:44] they had a truth they were for their
[36:47] time they they you will see them in
[36:49] heaven
[36:50] Dwight Moody you will see him in glory
[36:53] but he didn't have the message of the
[36:55] hour he was not a Vindicated scriptural
[36:58] prophet
[36:59] we believe that William Brown was a
[37:01] scriptural Prophet because he he he just
[37:05] fit the mold of everything God said we
[37:07] needed in the end time he fit it and I
[37:10] believe it all right so this is what he
[37:12] said he said we're not building an
[37:14] organization I'm not here this morning
[37:16] to build an organization Christ never
[37:18] sent me to build an organization Christ
[37:20] sent me to build individuals
[37:23] all right if you don't drink milk that's
[37:25] okay that will sustain you but it will
[37:27] not make you grow in Grace and knowledge
[37:30] grow and strength and virtue and
[37:32] different things that they might be the
[37:34] PowerHouse you know if you take a little
[37:36] axle and you just keep giving him milk
[37:38] and giving him milk and giving him milk
[37:39] and he's 14 years old and you don't give
[37:41] him nothing but milk he'll be
[37:42] malnourished
[37:44] that's the same way you are in the
[37:45] gospel there's a birth you and I are
[37:47] birthed into this gospel by the New
[37:49] Birth by the holy ghost coming into our
[37:51] soul changing our life changing Who We
[37:54] Are
[37:55] and then what happens we have we're a
[37:57] baby
[37:58] with Christ that God please give me I I
[38:01] you don't remember that but you know why
[38:02] a little bit later on my kids are are
[38:05] almost 40 and well 37.
[38:11] they better not come crying to me
[38:14] for some little something
[38:16] I said grow up boy
[38:19] That's What God Says though he tells us
[38:21] he says grow up boy
[38:22] grow up girl you need to grow up all
[38:25] right quit doing these things I'm over
[38:27] and over again I'm doing this stuff for
[38:29] you grow up all right that they might be
[38:33] that what he's going to build
[38:34] individuals not just build them and they
[38:36] sit there they're going to be a what a
[38:38] Powerhouse and the dwelling place of the
[38:41] spirit of God by his word
[38:43] by his words he build up the individual
[38:46] to that place and we believe we're
[38:49] talking about the word Virtue virtue is
[38:51] strength it's something that comes from
[38:53] inside of you and it is pushed out it's
[38:57] like I said many times before
[38:59] um Logan if I needed somebody to pray
[39:01] for me I'm not going to the drunk
[39:03] I'm not going to the mechanic
[39:07] I'll go to the mechanic if I need my car
[39:09] fixed because I don't have a clue how to
[39:10] fix my car I know how to go key turn and
[39:14] after that is yours all right I don't
[39:17] even want to pretend that I know how to
[39:18] fix a car amen so I don't but now if I
[39:21] need something from God I don't go to
[39:23] the mechanic
[39:24] I go to where their strength I go to
[39:26] where I can draw something out of I go
[39:28] to God all right so should you you
[39:30] should go to God and not have to go to
[39:32] all these other things
[39:34] then the prophet God tells us there's
[39:35] virtue anyone knows what the word virtue
[39:37] means see
[39:38] and we must have it and virtue went from
[39:40] him to heal the woman that was sick then
[39:43] really it didn't have anything to do
[39:44] with him being a virgin we know he was
[39:46] but he didn't have nothing to do with
[39:47] him being a virgin it's because there
[39:49] was power and that word power means
[39:52] dunamis are where we get the word
[39:53] Dynamite which that's the power of the
[39:56] holy ghost in a believer that we cannot
[39:59] keep it with us that we give it out
[40:02] that we can what preach the unreachable
[40:05] unsearchable reaches of God to who
[40:09] to each other and to this world
[40:12] this world will never hear about Jesus
[40:13] Christ unless do you
[40:15] never
[40:17] all right
[40:18] he's expecting the same virtue in his
[40:20] church because he was our example
[40:22] and if he had virtue to give to the
[40:24] people he expects us to have virtue to
[40:26] give to the people and what is virtue
[40:28] virtue is strength or power today we
[40:31] came to what as this next word said we
[40:33] came to what pull on God we came to pull
[40:36] on a gift that God give me give you give
[40:39] brother Joe give all the different ones
[40:41] to what to break the spell of what
[40:44] you've had all week
[40:48] oh so y'all been okay all week
[40:51] we'll pray for me I got dumped on and so
[40:54] did Brother boy he's got his hand up
[40:56] twice
[40:57] but what brought us here we knew we
[40:59] could get strength here
[41:01] when you you can't we could get virtue
[41:03] here it was a pull that was pulling us
[41:05] and we know that the prophet had three
[41:07] pulls in his life or what to what to
[41:09] perform or carryout to draw the
[41:11] supporter attention of and the first
[41:13] poll was what he would show his hand he
[41:15] would hold somebody's hand and they
[41:17] would bumps go across his hand and he
[41:19] would tell them that they were sick
[41:22] to through looking at the hand flesh
[41:25] then the next pull or the next part of
[41:28] his ministry was he would literally
[41:30] bring people up to the platform and he
[41:32] would tell them where they came from
[41:33] what their mother's name was what how
[41:36] many times hundreds of thousands of
[41:38] times never been wrong one time
[41:40] he'd tell you he said I see a doctor
[41:42] with a clipboard in his hand he's blind
[41:45] and he's got on glasses how detailed is
[41:48] that he was looking at the thing he
[41:50] wasn't guessing he was looking at the
[41:53] vision of you at the doctor's office oh
[41:55] I see you grabbed your side
[41:57] he's always cancer in your in your in
[41:59] your kidney or something you know he'd
[42:01] tell them what it was I need to say if
[42:03] you believe
[42:04] all things are possible
[42:06] we see a lot of we saw a lot of people
[42:08] we have some in our Sanctuary today that
[42:10] were in those meetings
[42:12] that saw those things happen and we
[42:15] still see them happen you know I that's
[42:16] okay to live to no it's not I'm sorry
[42:19] it's not it's not okay to live back
[42:21] there
[42:22] we need to have an updated Revelation to
[42:24] where we can see those things happen all
[42:26] right the discernment's coming forth
[42:27] from the word of God now not so much as
[42:29] a prophetic gift because that gift was
[42:31] brother Adam said one to a generation
[42:33] in a way he said one to a generation
[42:36] that kind of gift
[42:38] but you and I are what we are we are
[42:41] required to have gifts
[42:43] of the spirit so we all can have a gift
[42:46] and a gift of discernment and different
[42:47] things of wisdom and faith and all the
[42:50] speaking in tongues and interpretation
[42:52] so the second
[42:54] or the second part of his ministry
[42:57] but the virtues in brother Brown because
[42:59] remember when he would stand in that
[43:01] line and there'd be 20 or 30 people and
[43:03] and he would he would tell them who they
[43:05] were and tell them what their what their
[43:08] uh issue was about 20 or 30 people later
[43:10] he was totally exhausted why because his
[43:13] Humanity was being used by God and and
[43:17] those people were pulling the virtue out
[43:19] of him and he would actually collapse
[43:22] because of that
[43:24] but we come now to where we're going to
[43:26] get to a little bit later on is the
[43:28] opening of the word or the Seven Seals
[43:30] will not talk on that too much today
[43:32] because it we need to stay like we need
[43:35] to stay all right everybody good
[43:37] so what today was is I was thinking
[43:41] the other day
[43:43] that we quote a lot of things we quote
[43:48] that we don't explain
[43:52] all right because remember we quoted the
[43:54] quote this messenger Malachi 4 will do
[43:56] two things remember turn the hearts to
[43:57] the fathers to the children I mean to
[44:00] the children to the fathers and then
[44:02] open the Seven Seals well we just kind
[44:04] of throw that out there all right well
[44:06] I'm going to try to help us understand
[44:10] because don't show your hands but how
[44:12] many of you really know when we say the
[44:14] faith of the fathers can you explain
[44:15] what that is
[44:19] can you really explain when I say we've
[44:22] got to get back to the faith of well if
[44:23] I explain something you don't know what
[44:25] the faith of the fathers are how do you
[44:27] know you got back there
[44:29] how do you know those things are working
[44:31] in your life
[44:32] if you don't know what the faith of the
[44:34] fathers is now the fathers is what those
[44:37] saints that were way back 2 000 years
[44:41] ago they saw the Lord Jesus most of them
[44:43] did they got the holy ghost Legos right
[44:46] there on the day of Pentecost and they
[44:48] were the fathers of the Gospel all right
[44:53] John was
[44:55] during that period of time and John
[44:57] would take he was taking the the Old
[45:00] Testament the old Saints and he was
[45:03] showing them a new way
[45:05] everybody with me say Amen
[45:07] Behold the Lamb of God to take he didn't
[45:10] say Behold the Lamb that Caiaphas is
[45:12] going to put on the altar
[45:14] is that okay if we go this way today
[45:15] it's okay I feel like we're led to go
[45:17] this way he didn't say Behold the Lamb
[45:20] that Caiaphas is going to put on the
[45:21] altar that's going to forgive your sins
[45:23] just for one year
[45:25] if you're a liar you're going to still
[45:26] be a liar if you're a thief you're still
[45:28] going to be a thief but God's covered
[45:30] you by that blood but when you turn to
[45:32] the New Testament we knew that the Bible
[45:35] told us that a virgin shall conceive and
[45:37] that we would have somebody come that
[45:39] would be a council of the Prince of
[45:40] Peace the Mighty God I read to you there
[45:42] and if you want to read who Jesus Christ
[45:44] is read that book that I told you about
[45:46] you go into Isaiah 53 and you see what
[45:49] he did for us
[45:50] so what was John doing John was in the
[45:53] Old Testament but he was pointing them
[45:55] from the faith
[45:57] right
[45:59] guy everybody with me all right
[46:02] from them he's going to turn them to a
[46:05] new gospel Behold the Lamb of God that
[46:06] takes away the sin of the world and this
[46:08] Jesus comes along and as Jesus comes
[46:11] along that Faith starts building in
[46:14] those fathers
[46:17] they've got these virtues working in
[46:19] their life Silver and Gold Have I None
[46:20] read the book of Acts and that's what
[46:22] the Bible was talking about Discerning
[46:24] whether somebody was holding back a few
[46:25] dollars cost them their life
[46:28] but that was discernment during that
[46:31] faith of the fathers
[46:33] but now remember that guy
[46:36] well well I'm not going to read it but
[46:38] it says you've lost your first love what
[46:39] happened man starts getting involved and
[46:42] starts making denominations and tearing
[46:44] the word apart isn't that what Satan's
[46:46] job is is to tear it apart
[46:48] God is to build a church Satan is to
[46:50] tear it apart
[46:52] all right so look
[46:54] let's watch this right here just for a
[46:55] second then let's stop in the layout of
[46:57] seeing Church age the property God said
[46:59] this master of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[47:00] is going to do two things now I'm going
[47:03] to make this into two parts
[47:05] because I want to explain this quote all
[47:08] right let him praise the Lord all he
[47:10] wants to
[47:11] I wish some people we've got some people
[47:13] never even uttered that in the whole
[47:15] time in this church
[47:16] one according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[47:19] the hearts of the children
[47:22] to the fathers
[47:24] all right where were the fathers the
[47:25] fathers were way back two thousand years
[47:27] ago the faith of the fathers in other
[47:30] words to what the foundation of the
[47:33] church
[47:33] the real Church the foundation let me
[47:36] say brother Michael of the Bride
[47:38] church not just the church the church
[47:41] comes through all through that but the
[47:42] bride continues through all right
[47:45] everybody with me
[47:47] so Malachi 4 is gonna
[47:49] turn the hearts of the children
[47:52] to the fathers
[47:54] because the children have got down to be
[47:56] nothing but just babies and they they
[47:58] accept word of baptism in the name of
[47:59] the father son Holy Ghost which is false
[48:01] they accept that there's hell there's
[48:04] Eternal which is false she always false
[48:06] doctrines that they that they uphold
[48:08] saying that it's Doctrine and it's not
[48:12] amen
[48:13] so somebody
[48:16] God's got to use human flesh
[48:19] he's not coming back here himself and
[48:21] stand on the earth until everything's
[48:23] done and wiped out he said I'm going to
[48:25] do it through my people
[48:27] and the Word was made flesh your flesh
[48:32] Satan will be conquered by you
[48:36] Devils I mean Jesus is already conquered
[48:38] him kicked him out of heaven
[48:42] he just wants us
[48:44] to do it in flesh
[48:46] because Satan said I'm going to weaken
[48:48] this whole group I'm going to put them
[48:50] in flesh
[48:51] they can't stand it they can't stand to
[48:54] God's word they can't stand up to the to
[48:57] the trials of Life they can't look what
[48:59] I did to Eve I only told her just a few
[49:01] words and the whole world fell
[49:04] that's what he's thinking about me and
[49:05] you
[49:07] he's thinking he can whip us because of
[49:09] our weakness in the flesh and oh my I'll
[49:11] tell you
[49:12] week to week it looks like it sometimes
[49:16] everybody with me well if all of you
[49:18] that don't have no problem pray for us
[49:19] to do
[49:23] if you don't have a problem in life I
[49:24] think the devil may already have you
[49:27] hello somebody
[49:31] so the Revelation that brother Branham
[49:33] was to bring or this messenger of
[49:35] Malachi for
[49:37] according to what we've been talking
[49:39] about
[49:40] he brings us a revelation of who the Son
[49:42] of God is
[49:43] Jesus walking on the face of the Earth
[49:45] he was the son of man he was God in
[49:48] human flesh
[49:49] but now we come to this place to where
[49:51] there's a revelation the prophet says
[49:53] through the church ages of the son of
[49:56] God
[49:57] which means that there can be now listen
[50:00] to me real real careful there can be
[50:02] some error
[50:04] in that
[50:05] in God not in the word but in man
[50:09] God accepted Luther's light
[50:13] as truth
[50:15] of a father son Holy Ghost baptism but
[50:18] what was inside a Luther
[50:20] didn't believe that kind of a paradox
[50:22] there you think well how can that happen
[50:23] well that's how strong the devil is
[50:26] folks
[50:27] That's How Strong the devil is getting
[50:29] into a church and tearing a church apart
[50:31] I'm talking about this church I'm
[50:32] talking about church world
[50:35] all right trying to tear the bride up
[50:36] Andy what'd he do he did just like he
[50:38] did in heaven he told his tail
[50:42] remember he told his tail to those
[50:44] angels and a third of the Angels came
[50:46] with him he's a real good preacher if
[50:48] you don't understand what I'm talking
[50:50] about he's not something that sets
[50:52] around with horns and it's red and got a
[50:54] tail
[50:55] no he's gonna tell you a tail all right
[50:57] it's gonna be a lie but the devil is
[51:00] beautiful the Bible says Satan was
[51:01] Lucifer was the most beautiful angel
[51:06] and he still is today
[51:08] because he'll throw you beauty
[51:12] more than he will to obey the word of
[51:13] God
[51:16] amen
[51:18] because as we've always said there's a
[51:19] lot of things in the word of God that we
[51:21] do that the world says oh we don't have
[51:23] to do that
[51:24] we don't have to do that to be a
[51:25] Christian
[51:27] well we don't what do you mean you gotta
[51:29] what do you mean about this pants and
[51:31] cutting hair and all that you'll learn
[51:32] that later on but it's in the Bible
[51:35] it's in the Bible that you don't do it
[51:37] somebody had to tell you you could do it
[51:40] and it wasn't God no
[51:42] so it had to be what man had to be the
[51:45] devil so the devil's here I mean he he
[51:46] came to church he got here before y'all
[51:48] did
[51:49] right amen
[51:50] I hope you didn't bring him with you but
[51:52] he got here for what he did
[51:54] so the revelation of the Son of God that
[51:56] when the master of Malachi 4 is going to
[51:58] do two things number one he's going to
[51:59] what turn us back to the faith of the
[52:01] fathers the faith of the fathers is what
[52:04] the statue of perfect man working in our
[52:06] life Faith virtue and all this
[52:07] temprification godliness brother
[52:08] kindness but now remember you got to
[52:11] stop there where it says love
[52:15] because that wasn't in the church ages
[52:18] that kind of love now the love of God
[52:20] was but not that kind of love everybody
[52:22] with me because here's the second one
[52:25] because the third pull is or the third
[52:27] part of his ministry was he will reveal
[52:30] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[52:32] Revelations 10. now look John solemn
[52:35] but he couldn't write them
[52:37] mystery keep it so there is something
[52:40] there
[52:41] it's not just something floating around
[52:43] in the air there was something John saw
[52:45] and God said or the Christ that angel
[52:48] which was Christ said no seal it up John
[52:50] Till the time of the end but in the days
[52:52] of the voice of the seventh angel that's
[52:54] where we believe that our Prophet come
[52:55] in and got involved in the word of God
[52:58] so in Revelations 10 which are the
[53:00] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[53:03] see the Seven Seals now let let me not
[53:06] make it so strong I don't mean the Seven
[53:08] Seals don't have anything to do with the
[53:10] Statue of perfect man but you can come
[53:12] to Faith virtue in all his temper's
[53:13] patience God listen brotherly kindness
[53:15] without even knowing what the seals are
[53:22] Paul didn't know anything about sales
[53:24] John's the only one that really wrote
[53:26] anything down about him
[53:28] but now look the word of God though is
[53:31] like a puzzle you have to fit that
[53:34] puzzle together Paul spoke about the
[53:37] seals John spoke about the seals Peter
[53:40] spoke about the seals
[53:43] everybody spoke Matthew Martin Luke and
[53:45] John they all spoke of it but it took a
[53:48] profit in the end time to what pull them
[53:51] together
[53:53] so it pulled it together what it would
[53:55] be these divinely revealed mystery
[53:57] truths that literally turned what the
[53:59] hearts of the children us that are born
[54:01] again in the message to growing grace
[54:03] and knowledge not old Pentecost
[54:06] the first part of brother Brown's
[54:07] Ministry was to get old Pentecost
[54:09] babbling bunch of babies back to
[54:11] establish the faith of the fathers
[54:13] establish what had been lost for two
[54:15] thousand years he was establishing that
[54:18] during his first part of his ministry 47
[54:21] and about 1963 is everybody with me now
[54:23] listen we're not a church that believes
[54:25] you need to throw your books away before
[54:26] 1963. you will never understand the
[54:29] sales without that Foundation of
[54:32] 1947-1963 if you don't understand what
[54:34] I'm talking about that was when brother
[54:35] Brown started preaching and then in 1963
[54:37] in other words 61 or two he says I'm
[54:39] fixing to enter into a new phase of my
[54:41] Ministry all right and that new phase
[54:43] had never been
[54:45] since Jesus Christ was on the face of
[54:46] the Earth
[54:48] that new phase was just for me and you
[54:50] sitting here today
[54:57] he missed the field goal
[55:00] that's what you should have said
[55:03] the devil missed the field goal
[55:05] and we win okay so that's for us it's
[55:08] the seals and you say you see where the
[55:10] god hits for the seals or the son of man
[55:13] Revelations which we hadn't got to yet
[55:14] but we got to have all this Foundation
[55:16] to get to here because remember that was
[55:19] what was rejected who was the chief
[55:22] headstone it was the Lord Jesus they
[55:25] didn't understand
[55:26] all about him walking around in flesh
[55:30] and he was almighty God not just a piece
[55:33] of God he was God
[55:35] everybody with me they couldn't
[55:37] understand that so that was a mystery so
[55:39] so
[55:41] um irenius could say no he was God
[55:44] and then serenthius could come along
[55:46] another minister in the gospel another
[55:48] message believer come on somebody
[55:50] he was a preacher but he was preaching
[55:53] that it was what a light substance of
[55:55] God so that carried into 325 A.D brother
[55:59] where I'm sitting said a lot of old
[56:01] prophets and a lot of what a lot of
[56:02] people that had the truth went to nicaea
[56:05] but there was so much overwhelming power
[56:08] of the Devils everybody with me with
[56:10] this that not sound familiar it's what's
[56:12] happening now the overpowering power of
[56:16] the devil in the men
[56:19] yeah change their doctor
[56:22] change their Doctrine to say well I
[56:24] think we'll just take father son Holy
[56:25] Ghost that's what Jesus said in Matthew
[56:29] yeah I know it's what Jesus said in
[56:30] Matthew
[56:33] but the name he was talking about is in
[56:35] Acts 2 38.
[56:38] because what is the name of the father
[56:39] to the son Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus
[56:41] Christ
[56:45] I would not give somebody the keys to my
[56:47] house if I didn't think they could
[56:48] handle it
[56:50] right
[56:51] would you
[56:53] no but sure enough Jesus gave the keys
[56:56] to Peter
[56:58] and said whatever you bind on Earth I'm
[57:00] bind in heaven whatever you're loose on
[57:01] Earth I'll loosen haven't sworn today of
[57:02] Pentecost Peter loosed a Doctrine
[57:06] and man took it immediately and flipped
[57:10] it around
[57:11] oh we'll take this over here so that see
[57:13] those so the seals are the revelations
[57:19] um four five six seven and eight all
[57:22] that in there
[57:23] was for the son of man coming back in
[57:25] the end time the chief headstone which
[57:27] what he's what's he going to do here
[57:29] he's going to carry us out of here
[57:31] all right the Lord Jesus is going to
[57:33] come back he's already here
[57:35] but he's back in his bride now he's in
[57:37] Bride form he wanted that
[57:41] because look what he says look the
[57:42] evening messenger this is 1963. this is
[57:45] uh
[57:46] right before the silver priest actually
[57:48] 116 1963 silver preached in March right
[57:52] so look bring back the church to the
[57:54] word now what is this messenger of
[57:56] Malachi 4 to do restore back the
[57:59] original faith
[58:01] the resurrection faith
[58:06] what was the sign of the Resurrection
[58:08] the discernment
[58:11] that was the silent son of man
[58:13] because that's what the sign of son of
[58:15] man is now brother I'm stood years and
[58:16] years and years he said this is the sign
[58:18] of the son of man
[58:20] that discernment would go for Sarah in
[58:23] the tent behind laughing and him knowing
[58:26] what was going on look restore back the
[58:29] original Faith the resurrection Faith
[58:32] because remember they didn't have a
[58:34] resurrection faith
[58:36] not all of it
[58:40] man immediately said no let's let's make
[58:42] it this let's let's say well we can be a
[58:45] Baptist and we can be a Methodist and we
[58:47] can be a Pentecostal and we can be a a
[58:49] presbyterian and and you know each one's
[58:52] got their own little caveat that they
[58:54] can do you know Presbyterian
[58:55] Presbyterian you can drink a little
[58:58] you know and the Baptist they don't mind
[59:00] you smoking a little but don't drink
[59:03] and the Presbyterian says well we can
[59:05] have a little we have a little alcohol
[59:06] We're Not Gonna smoke well that ain't
[59:08] got nothing to do with the Bible
[59:10] if they get the baptism of the Holy
[59:12] Ghost in their soul they kick both of
[59:13] them out
[59:15] so who's right the Holy Ghost is right
[59:19] not to smoke and drink and cussing
[59:20] listen that's not sin
[59:22] sin is you not believing that the word
[59:25] of God can take that out of your life
[59:28] I'm telling you I didn't smoke but I
[59:30] chewed tobacco since I was 14 years old
[59:32] played baseball and I went through I'm
[59:35] talking about Red Man
[59:37] switched over to Levi Garrett when it
[59:39] was two for one
[59:44] dip snuff
[59:46] but today God saved my soul right here
[59:48] the day God saved me
[59:51] my wife's a witness I had it all over
[59:54] the house I had it in the car I owed it
[59:55] to people you know how you do sometimes
[59:57] you know cigarette hey man you got a
[59:58] cigarette yeah here take a pack well I
[1:00:00] had people that I owed children tobacco
[1:00:02] too so I went and bought it for them I
[1:00:03] did because I owed it to him you're
[1:00:05] strange well this is family here okay
[1:00:07] they all call Daddy strange about some
[1:00:10] things he did so it's out of the same
[1:00:12] way but you know what that desire of
[1:00:13] doing that went away and I've never had
[1:00:16] that desire again
[1:00:17] I've had that temptation
[1:00:22] but I've never had that desire
[1:00:25] to put that junk in my mouth
[1:00:28] amen same way with alcohol same way with
[1:00:31] women same way what it was just unbelief
[1:00:33] I didn't believe God's word could do
[1:00:34] that to me
[1:00:36] but when I become a Believer that's why
[1:00:38] they call it Believers when I become a
[1:00:40] Believer old things passed away
[1:00:43] that mold cleans unclean spirits went
[1:00:45] out on me I didn't want to do that
[1:00:46] anymore
[1:00:47] you know why because the want to do it
[1:00:50] left
[1:00:51] and then what the want to do the will of
[1:00:54] God came in praise the Lord
[1:00:58] bring back the church to the word now
[1:00:59] what is this master of Malachi 4 to do
[1:01:01] restore back the original faith
[1:01:04] that they've seen Jesus after he had
[1:01:07] raised from the dead seen him working
[1:01:09] among them they were men of few words
[1:01:12] they went forth and preached the word oh
[1:01:14] look I'm going to read this one I didn't
[1:01:16] put it red but I'm gonna read it anyway
[1:01:17] oh they preached long
[1:01:20] well don't get quiet
[1:01:23] Paul preached All Night One Time make
[1:01:26] the visitors nervous
[1:01:29] Paul preached all night one time and you
[1:01:31] know what a man fell asleep
[1:01:35] some of y'all if y'all was on a building
[1:01:38] we'd be praying for you too
[1:01:40] a man fell out of the building and
[1:01:42] killed himself
[1:01:43] he laid his body over and Paul did and
[1:01:46] brought him back to life you know why if
[1:01:47] I'd have been Paul I'd have said that
[1:01:49] was my fault
[1:01:53] I thought he went to sleep but boy the
[1:01:56] word was so good and you always amen and
[1:01:58] ain't man in a minute and he just nodded
[1:02:00] off and fell out the window
[1:02:02] and then Paul went down there and laid
[1:02:04] on his body on him and what brought him
[1:02:06] right back to life amen
[1:02:08] so don't get scared we can pray for the
[1:02:10] sick
[1:02:11] if y'all fall asleep and fall out of the
[1:02:13] chair
[1:02:14] and the layout of seeing churches this
[1:02:16] is 1960. this is a couple years before
[1:02:18] the seals and the Heart of the children
[1:02:20] to fathers now when this great Elijah
[1:02:22] comes in the end of this age
[1:02:25] he'll be taking the message of Pentecost
[1:02:27] look to turn the children what
[1:02:30] Pentecostal children
[1:02:32] Pentecostal speaking in tongues all that
[1:02:35] is is speaking in tongues you speak in
[1:02:37] tongues you got the holy ghost that is
[1:02:38] not true Devils speak in tongues all
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:43] he'll take the message of Pentecost to
[1:02:45] turn the children to the faith of the
[1:02:47] fathers because he'll be rebuking them
[1:02:50] because they didn't keep this same faith
[1:02:53] that was in the beginning
[1:02:55] all right there's the faith of the
[1:02:56] fathers the faith of Paul irenius
[1:03:01] John
[1:03:02] Matthew Luke all the different ones all
[1:03:05] right read the book of Acts that's where
[1:03:07] it'll be
[1:03:09] he'll rebuked him because they didn't
[1:03:11] keep this same faith that was back there
[1:03:12] in the beginning amen now I believe we
[1:03:15] pretty well realize it's going to be
[1:03:17] Elijah don't we now we know it
[1:03:21] and there he was standing talking to us
[1:03:23] all right the spirit of Elijah Brother
[1:03:25] Brad wasn't Elijah he had a spirit of
[1:03:26] Elijah on him because God promised he'd
[1:03:29] send the spirit of Elijah in the end
[1:03:30] time according to Malachi 4. 1961
[1:03:33] Abraham's Covenant confirmed
[1:03:36] brother Brown said look and notice here
[1:03:37] the first Elijah was to come or he lies
[1:03:40] he would turn the hearts of the children
[1:03:42] well he he messed up he said the hearts
[1:03:45] of the fathers to the children what see
[1:03:48] the old patriarch fathers the old
[1:03:50] Orthodox the legalist the law he turned
[1:03:53] it back to the faith of the fathers here
[1:03:55] to the children what the new age
[1:03:59] Behold the Lamb of God like I said
[1:04:00] before it takes away the sin of the
[1:04:01] world get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:04] it's not going to be just an anointing
[1:04:05] it's going to be a failing and it's
[1:04:06] going to be God entering into a person
[1:04:09] and doing the work not just anointing
[1:04:11] him
[1:04:12] right right
[1:04:14] the faith of the father is here to the
[1:04:15] church
[1:04:16] the hearts of the children this new
[1:04:18] message that John was preaching see of
[1:04:21] the coming Messiah at hand he turns the
[1:04:24] hearts to this but now watch the next
[1:04:27] time John appears he turns the hearts he
[1:04:30] meant he means Elijah you know that he
[1:04:32] turns the hearts of the children back to
[1:04:34] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so
[1:04:37] it'd be back to the original message
[1:04:40] and you'll know when it gets here
[1:04:44] a lot of people didn't folks but you
[1:04:46] don't know when he gets here it's here
[1:04:50] it'll be a restoration to send that
[1:04:53] lukewarm gladysan church back to that
[1:04:57] original Faith back Yonder again yes sir
[1:04:59] and he will be anointed to do so when
[1:05:02] this Elijah comes he'll be a prophet he
[1:05:05] will pull no punches he will cut right
[1:05:07] and left
[1:05:09] what's he talking about restoring Joel
[1:05:12] promised him
[1:05:14] Joel 2 25 says I will restore who got
[1:05:17] will restore to you the years that the
[1:05:20] locusts eat canker worm caterpillar Palm
[1:05:23] worm these are all the same bug eating
[1:05:24] on the same tree
[1:05:26] my great Army which I sent among you and
[1:05:29] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:05:31] well now remember this is after the
[1:05:33] restoring
[1:05:35] read restoration of the brine tree
[1:05:37] he got to eat down to a stump they
[1:05:39] wouldn't have much life but you can't
[1:05:41] kill God
[1:05:43] can't kill God
[1:05:45] you make a little you say well where's
[1:05:47] God he's in his people
[1:05:49] he's not in your government he's not in
[1:05:51] your gas tank he's not in the car you
[1:05:54] driver he's not even in your
[1:05:56] place of work
[1:05:59] if you're at your place to work God's
[1:06:01] there
[1:06:03] that's why folks I'm telling you when
[1:06:05] this world when the bride leaves this
[1:06:07] world think about the absolute chaos
[1:06:10] that's going to come on this Earth
[1:06:16] family will be against family they'll
[1:06:18] fight each other
[1:06:20] it's coming don't worry
[1:06:22] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:06:24] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:06:26] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[1:06:28] with you and my people shall never
[1:06:32] be ashamed
[1:06:34] that's your perfect ma'am that's where
[1:06:35] brother Ram talks about one little nod
[1:06:37] just a little nod from God that's all
[1:06:39] God had to do then nothing's going to
[1:06:41] stop them they didn't question and study
[1:06:43] and hum Hall and worry like we do
[1:06:45] whether we should do this or that they
[1:06:47] went ahead and done it anyhow just one
[1:06:49] little nod from God that done it just as
[1:06:53] soon why how could they know it was a
[1:06:55] nod from God they had these virtues in
[1:06:57] them
[1:07:00] all these qualifications and the first
[1:07:02] little knot of God compared with every
[1:07:03] bit of this and with his word they note
[1:07:06] it was the word of God and the way they
[1:07:07] went don't have to worry about nothing
[1:07:09] else when God spoke it they went
[1:07:15] we're going to read this right here
[1:07:16] probably going to stop right here so we
[1:07:18] will uh pick this up a little bit later
[1:07:20] on or this afternoon
[1:07:22] um
[1:07:23] a virtuous woman is what a crowned to
[1:07:26] her husband
[1:07:29] but she didn't maketh she didn't maketh
[1:07:31] ashamed as rottenness in his bone
[1:07:34] folks God's going to have a bride he's
[1:07:36] got one now
[1:07:37] she's virtuous sinless he has we have
[1:07:40] been washed
[1:07:41] we have been changed back what's inside
[1:07:44] listen you may not be a virgin in your
[1:07:46] flesh but God can make you a virgin in
[1:07:48] your soul
[1:07:53] brother Brown says a woman can be
[1:07:55] forgiven but she can't be justified once
[1:07:57] you lose your virginity it's gone all
[1:07:59] right but
[1:08:01] but but thank God
[1:08:04] for God
[1:08:06] that calls you now by the new birth he
[1:08:09] has changed you to a virgin in your soul
[1:08:13] you can't be a virtuous you can't be a
[1:08:15] virtuous send this Pride to Jesus Christ
[1:08:17] without it
[1:08:19] a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[1:08:21] husband but she that maketh the same as
[1:08:22] rottenness to the Bone listen the pro
[1:08:25] the prophet of God and the word of God
[1:08:27] in the first church age he said you have
[1:08:31] become Nicolaitans
[1:08:33] and I hate you
[1:08:36] do we not need to read that we read it
[1:08:39] last Wednesday night
[1:08:41] God said you've left your first love
[1:08:44] he said but you also what I have that
[1:08:47] you have I I appreciate you hating the
[1:08:49] nicolaitan spirit
[1:08:51] like I hate it
[1:08:53] so what's he doing now a virtuous woman
[1:08:55] is a crown to her husband all those
[1:08:57] seven Church ages under their messenger
[1:08:59] were a crown to Jesus Christ
[1:09:02] but the ones that were outside of that
[1:09:04] he was ashamed of them
[1:09:07] God's ashamed of me and you when we do
[1:09:10] things wrong
[1:09:11] but there's something there's an anchor
[1:09:13] that holds inside
[1:09:14] we're human beings on the outside folks
[1:09:17] we know that
[1:09:18] we fall we make mistakes
[1:09:21] but if you got a typos if you got a
[1:09:23] Rudder under that ship of yours
[1:09:25] that spiritual Rudder will tell you what
[1:09:27] to do
[1:09:28] that spiritual writer will tell you not
[1:09:30] to put that cigarette in your mouth not
[1:09:31] to put that dip in tobacco not to say
[1:09:33] those bad words we used to say
[1:09:36] because what is it it's the spirit of
[1:09:38] God
[1:09:40] how can I be a Christian and all that a
[1:09:42] little bit try to act a little bit like
[1:09:43] a Christian or like God
[1:09:48] yeah but you this easy
[1:09:52] we all sin and come short of the glory
[1:09:54] of God but down inside your soul is
[1:09:58] something that they don't have
[1:10:00] it's something that if you do fall it'll
[1:10:03] pick your hind back up and you'll go do
[1:10:05] something good
[1:10:07] I'm a Christian I'm not I'm not counting
[1:10:10] the ways that I am and the ways that I
[1:10:12] ain't you shouldn't either
[1:10:15] brother Graham said what did he say he
[1:10:17] said the
[1:10:19] the mark of a true
[1:10:20] believer was that they get back up
[1:10:24] right and start
[1:10:27] yeah but you know what if you fall and
[1:10:29] stay there you wasn't a Believer to
[1:10:31] begin with
[1:10:33] a Believer will fall and get back up and
[1:10:36] say God forgive me of that I won't do
[1:10:38] that no more
[1:10:39] and then continue on because you know
[1:10:41] what the devil's going to train all his
[1:10:43] guns on us
[1:10:45] listen this real quick we'll close a
[1:10:47] virtuous woman in other words the bride
[1:10:49] of Christ cares for her family
[1:10:51] she's a hard worker
[1:10:53] while she talks Faithfully in meeting
[1:10:55] the needs of her own family she also
[1:10:58] doesn't forget to help the other needy
[1:10:59] people God brings across her path
[1:11:02] a virtuous woman also takes the time to
[1:11:04] look after her own health and be a good
[1:11:07] Steward of her body
[1:11:09] we're the body of Christ right
[1:11:13] show our virtuous woman meaning applies
[1:11:16] to the heart and then to every area
[1:11:19] of life
[1:11:22] Paul says life and godliness all right
[1:11:24] this should this should help us live
[1:11:26] life a lot better as we were saying
[1:11:28] before
[1:11:30] you know what it would be if everybody
[1:11:31] was a born-again Christian
[1:11:35] there'd be no divorce court
[1:11:37] there'd be no divorce lawyers praise God
[1:11:42] there'd be no liquor store on the side
[1:11:44] of the road I mean there'd be no
[1:11:45] alcoholic laws there'll be no DUIs
[1:11:48] there'll be no Police Department
[1:11:50] Well we'd have Deacons
[1:11:52] but that's where it's going to be in the
[1:11:53] new heaven new Earth isn't it
[1:11:57] you ever thought about that I mean
[1:11:59] listen we're still in humanity we're
[1:12:00] stuck brother John in humanity
[1:12:02] but we still have a quality
[1:12:05] that I don't need a DUI a DUI Law to
[1:12:08] change for me to get upset about it
[1:12:12] I don't I don't have to have a divorce
[1:12:14] court change the law and me get upset
[1:12:16] about it
[1:12:18] do you
[1:12:20] know cigarettes are five dollars a pack
[1:12:22] now
[1:12:23] so
[1:12:25] don't bother me anymore
[1:12:27] but you hear the world that's all
[1:12:29] they're saying
[1:12:33] I'm gonna go buy some lottery tickets so
[1:12:35] I can pay for these
[1:12:39] I'm just saying
[1:12:42] by being born again bride of Jesus
[1:12:44] Christ it automatically makes you think
[1:12:46] different
[1:12:47] and it automatically separates you from
[1:12:49] the world
[1:12:50] you mean you don't cuss no more no I
[1:12:52] don't cuss no more I used to cuss a lot
[1:12:55] because the customer's not in me anymore
[1:12:58] the Custer died
[1:13:01] I didn't say Custer I say Custer
[1:13:04] if Custer was a curse Custer he died too
[1:13:07] so
[1:13:09] but it applies to the heart look and
[1:13:10] then every area of your life
[1:13:15] you don't need a fresh air
[1:13:19] um uh what you calling things uh um
[1:13:21] diffuser
[1:13:23] to cover up the cigarette smoke because
[1:13:24] the preacher's coming to your house
[1:13:27] come on somebody
[1:13:30] that ashtray is full
[1:13:34] I don't even I had one in my house in 50
[1:13:37] years so why that bother me do you
[1:13:39] understand what I'm saying you say oh
[1:13:41] brother wait we got problems yeah we got
[1:13:42] problems I'm telling you you you you
[1:13:44] you're rubbed shoulders with the world

[1:13:50] and you see what they're going through
[1:13:52] sure we're having issue sure we're
[1:13:54] having problems but my heaven we have
[1:13:57] got a place to go
[1:13:59] we've got a man we can talk to we've got
[1:14:03] a holy ghost-filled group of people that
[1:14:05] we can bind together and not bind
[1:14:07] together and say
[1:14:09] I slipped up and had a couple of drinks
[1:14:11] of the day I'm not going back to
[1:14:12] Alcoholics Anonymous this is not alcohol
[1:14:14] it's anonymous
[1:14:16] this is not Reformation
[1:14:19] this is restoration restoring it back to
[1:14:21] where little axle there behind Smoked
[1:14:24] Cigarettes whole life has he
[1:14:26] bless his heart he hadn't drunken drunk
[1:14:27] and drink alcohol has he hadn't said a
[1:14:29] cuss word has he let's get back to that
[1:14:35] well remember we're born babes in Christ
[1:14:37] with
[1:14:42] us but now you let me let him get 13 14
[1:14:43] years old and listen to the world say
[1:14:45] these things and do these things we're
[1:14:47] influenced by this outside world let's
[1:14:49] stand to our feet
[1:14:52] a virtuous woman the bride and come on
[1:14:54] musicians
[1:14:55] goes in the strength of the Lord and
[1:14:57] Faithfully completes
[1:14:59] whatever task he has for her to do now
[1:15:01] what's our task our task to go to a body
[1:15:04] change
[1:15:05] our task is not just to be Christians
[1:15:08] and live out our life and and and and
[1:15:10] and die and and you know go to the other
[1:15:13] side
[1:15:15] it's for us to live so close to God that
[1:15:18] Satan don't know what to do with us
[1:15:21] when a person is described as having
[1:15:22] virtue it is seen as a quality that sets
[1:15:26] one apart look apart
[1:15:29] from everyone else in character strength
[1:15:32] and morality it is a common
[1:15:35] characteristic that can be found within
[1:15:37] the mindset of several women in the
[1:15:39] Bible like Ruth Esther and Mary as well
[1:15:41] as described of others through countless
[1:15:44] verses we'll read this and then we'll
[1:15:46] close a virtuous person exhibits The
[1:15:49] Joint Excellence of reason and character
[1:15:51] we hadn't even gotten to knowledge yet
[1:15:52] but that has a lot to do with that
[1:15:54] that's why knowledge is right these
[1:15:56] things are right exactly where they need
[1:15:57] to be
[1:15:58] you got to have Holy Ghost knowledge to
[1:16:00] even know about Temperance place at
[1:16:01] regardless of Brotherly kindness all
[1:16:03] right but you got to have virtue that
[1:16:05] strength to have the knowledge know
[1:16:07] where to go to get it
[1:16:08] The Virtuous person not only knows what

[1:23:59] apart
[1:24:01] for put your confidence on the world
[1:24:05] ever
[1:24:06] we put confidence in doctors and
[1:24:08] different things to help but God's the
[1:24:10] Healer and that's why we take these
[1:24:12] prayer closet we know in the book of um
[1:24:15] of Acts that they took cloths off of
[1:24:17] Paul he was so anointed you thought
[1:24:19] about that he was so anointed that even
[1:24:22] his clothes were anointed but it was a
[1:24:25] belief that they had it was that contact
[1:24:28] we need contact with God then we take
[1:24:30] these prayer cloths and we anoint them
[1:24:32] with oil and we give them to you and
[1:24:33] we've seen cancer healed
[1:24:35] we've seen broken bones go back together
[1:24:38] we've seen people
[1:24:40] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:42] we've seen you there's one standing
[1:24:44] there in the very back with a black
[1:24:46] shirt on that keeps the prayer cloth
[1:24:48] with him all the time
[1:24:51] he shouldn't actually be here
[1:24:54] there's a lot of you shouldn't be here
[1:24:56] well the dirty different ones that are
[1:24:58] they're not here today because of coming
[1:25:00] brother Kali but we've seen God it's not
[1:25:03] Hocus Pocus it's not something that's
[1:25:05] weird
[1:25:06] it's something that God told us to do
[1:25:09] he said lay hands on the sick and they
[1:25:10] shall recover anointing with oil that's
[1:25:12] right and pray the prayer of faith and
[1:25:14] you'll be healed so whatever you believe
[1:25:16] today you need to believe that God can
[1:25:19] do it Satan's not going to do it for you
[1:25:20] he's going to make it worse
[1:25:21] God's going to do it for you make it
[1:25:23] better God cannot listen God can't go
[1:25:25] against his own self
