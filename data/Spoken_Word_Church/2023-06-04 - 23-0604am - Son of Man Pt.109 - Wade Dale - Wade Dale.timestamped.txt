[13:43] world but he didn't decide to work the
[13:45] Plan of Redemption through Angels cows
[13:49] horses through human
[13:51] beings the lowest form supposedly that
[13:55] we are he took the lowest God's always
[13:58] that way
[13:59] he can take one and make a million he
[14:01] can take one and and defeat a thousand
[14:04] he's not in

[17:37] John said a renewing of our mind a true
[17:41] Resurrection a resurrection of the truth
[17:44] in our hearts and Lord let it not be
[17:47] that we're conformed to this world but
[17:49] that we're that we're renewed Lord by
[17:53] your mind coming into us and us being a
[17:57] part of you as we our worshippers We
[18:00] Worship You Lord today we worship you in
[18:02] song now we're going to worship you in
[18:04] word and deed as the Bible tells us
[18:08] father be with the ones that are sick
[18:09] sister Freda and different ones sister
[18:11] Johnny Sister Mary different ones that
[18:12] are not here we pray that you'd be with
[18:15] them and give them strength father we'd
[18:17] love to see them here in service and
[18:19] Lord I know they want to be here too so
[18:21] I pray that you'd raise them up father
[18:23] for your honor and glory Lord and help
[18:26] them with their situations Lord I pray
[18:29] that you'd be with us now in the
[18:30] furtherment of this service forgive us
[18:32] of our sins give us a blessing today
[18:34] that we cannot contain in Jesus name we
[18:37] pray amen that's part 109 we're still on
[18:40] the son of man but we're on
[18:42] godliness and then we'll talk a little
[18:44] bit on brotherly kind uh brotherly
[18:46] kindness because brotherly kindness is
[18:48] going to be a little uh maybe a little
[18:50] lengthy and a little touchy on certain
[18:52] some things but that's okay that's the
[18:54] last one right before we get to to the
[18:57] the Holy Ghost ghost sealing Us in all
[19:00] right so we want that that's what we
[19:01] want we want to come to the Statue of
[19:03] perfect man we don't want to just have
[19:04] this as as a meeting today and we just
[19:07] going to meet and we did our duty and
[19:09] we're going to get done with the service
[19:11] and go to the house all
[19:14] right you're wasting your time if you do
[19:17] that Amen in the beginning was the word
[19:20] word was with God and the Word was God
[19:22] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[19:24] among us and we beheld his glory the
[19:25] glory of the only begotten of the father
[19:28] full of grace and truth second Peter 1
[19:32] that's where we've been with our thought
[19:34] and besides this giving all diligence
[19:37] add to your faith virtue and the virtue
[19:39] of knowledge now remember we're going to
[19:41] get back to that when we go to that
[19:42] interval part look at that word add add
[19:45] to your faith faith is not an ad you're
[19:48] adding to your faith all right so you're
[19:50] adding to your faith all right and to
[19:53] knowledge Temperance to Virtue knowledge
[19:54] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[19:56] patience godliness and to Godliness
[19:58] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[19:59] kindness charity and it continues on it
[20:01] says if these things be in you abound
[20:03] it'll make you that you'll be what
[20:05] prosperous as brother John was talking
[20:07] about the natural part it does meld with
[20:10] the spiritual part uh there there's if
[20:13] you have chaos in your life then you
[20:14] probably got a little chaos in your
[20:16] spiritual life hello somebody amen all
[20:19] right so you may be seated the Lord as
[20:20] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[20:22] and we'll get into that just a little
[20:23] bit because we were talking last night
[20:25] about the about the horse forehead and
[20:27] it's kind of a strong word to use but
[20:29] it's in the Bible all right is everybody
[20:32] with me it's in Jeremiah we'll read it
[20:33] in just a little bit but I kind of went
[20:35] over at Wednesday night and and if you
[20:38] if you weren't here Wednesday night I
[20:39] would appreciate if you'd listen to that
[20:41] one again because it really did help me
[20:43] and some of you said it really helped
[20:44] you uh that were here uh to know what
[20:48] godliness is godliness is something that
[20:51] we put like on this great huge tall
[20:54] mountain and we can't get
[20:57] there
[20:59] we ain't good enough you ain't good
[21:00] enough I ain't good enough you know we
[21:02] went through our whole life you ain't
[21:03] good enough and then if you try to tell
[21:05] talk to somebody that's the first thing
[21:07] they said you ain't perfect and I ain't
[21:08] perfect well we know that but we can
[21:11] live closer to God than the world I
[21:15] hope we're supposed to be in the world
[21:17] but not of this world all right so
[21:20] that's come to a place and two there was
[21:22] a there was a little question last night
[21:25] we were talking about babies and I want
[21:27] to cover that and just too because it
[21:29] does help us in all this of going up the
[21:32] statue of perfect man you you got to be
[21:34] born again and you got to know that
[21:35] you're born again you got to know the
[21:36] difference in being born again and being
[21:39] saved all right 1 Timothy 3:16 Says look
[21:43] without controversy so when we talk at
[21:46] the toward the end of this you're going
[21:48] to see the mystery of godliness where is
[21:52] it it's a mystery to the world but it's
[21:55] not a mystery to me and you amen we know
[21:58] where to find godliness it's in the true
[22:01] Bible the true word of God and in the
[22:03] message of the hour if you'll live it
[22:05] through the word of God not just say I'm
[22:07] a message believer I don't cut my hair I
[22:09] don't smoke I
[22:11] don't okay so without
[22:15] controversy great is the mystery of
[22:17] godliness why because the people in the
[22:19] world are going to say you can't be like
[22:22] God and I can't be like God all right
[22:24] but the mystery is that we can and God
[22:28] told us he'd be with us in John 177 he
[22:30] didn't tell he didn't tell us he'd take
[22:32] us out of the world he'd tell us how to
[22:34] live in the world all right as we were
[22:36] talking last night you can't you can't
[22:39] not rub shoulders with the world you
[22:42] can't put yourself in a bubble you can't
[22:44] put yourself on a mountain somewhere and
[22:46] and be a prepper and think you can live
[22:48] off of uh your own self and but that
[22:52] makes me Godly no it doesn't make you
[22:54] Godly there another word for that but
[22:58] without controversy great is the mystery
[23:00] of godliness God was manifest In the
[23:03] Flesh now we know this talking about
[23:04] Jesus but who else is talking about me
[23:06] and you yes me and you can do this
[23:09] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[23:11] preaching to the Gentiles believed on in
[23:13] the world received up into Glory you
[23:15] know that's exactly what we're doing now
[23:16] we're preaching to the
[23:18] Gentiles believed on in this world and
[23:21] we're going to be received up Glory
[23:22] we're going in a Rapture amen this is
[23:24] the whole part of this that we're
[23:26] looking at we're going to take a rapture
[23:28] yes as we were talking about last night
[23:30] all right so that word is is Strife or
[23:34] dispute or or quarrel so without
[23:36] controversy without any quarreling we're
[23:39] going to talk about today the how to get
[23:43] Godly and do it without being some you
[23:47] know Superman cape and and all that
[23:49] stuff that you got to put on all right
[23:52] remember Superman did have a
[23:54] weakness all right at Kryptonite well
[23:57] our weaknesses is
[23:58] sin but we will prevail because we're
[24:00] not Superman all right we're God man
[24:03] with a Superman in us all right so this
[24:06] Plan of Redemption that we we were kind
[24:08] of touching on last night and I'll tell
[24:11] you some of the things that we were
[24:12] talking about we've talking about babies
[24:13] going to heaven and and come to the age
[24:15] of accountability and will they go into
[24:17] Rapture and I kind of thought I would go
[24:19] over it just a little bit more um got a
[24:22] call uh that was still questioning a
[24:24] little bit but last night we were
[24:27] talking about
[24:28] if you take a child and say junor and I
[24:31] have a child and and it doesn't come to
[24:33] the age of
[24:34] accountability it can't be it's covered
[24:38] under this great Plan of Redemption okay
[24:41] all right but we've got to see
[24:43] categories in that great Plan of
[24:46] Redemption everybody with me all
[24:49] right you can be
[24:52] saved and not born
[24:55] again but you can't be born born again
[24:59] and not be
[25:01] saved all right one more
[25:04] time all right you can be saved and not
[25:06] born again two different words but you
[25:10] can't be born again and not be saved you
[25:12] got to come through that process of
[25:15] salvation but saved does not put you in
[25:18] a
[25:20] Rapture saved will not put you in a
[25:24] Rapture saved will not put you in Bride
[25:29] the only way you can be bride and come
[25:31] up in the first
[25:33] resurrection is to be born again in your
[25:36] soul before you
[25:39] die some of these people can be saved
[25:42] under the Plan of Redemption pass away
[25:45] but they and be given eternal life but
[25:48] they're not bride they're not coming up
[25:50] in the in the first resurrection and
[25:52] they'll not live in a new city but
[25:54] they'll be saved because the Bible says
[25:55] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[25:57] thou shalt be saved okay there are
[26:00] millions and billions of people that get
[26:02] saved everybody with me but now to
[26:06] continue on as that you got the Baptist
[26:09] say once saved always saved well brother
[26:11] Brown he didn't believe that neither do
[26:12] I but I do believe once Born Again
[26:15] always born again all right you can lose
[26:18] see that's where people you can lose
[26:19] your salvation but you can't lose listen
[26:23] you can't lose that new birth in your
[26:25] soul right you can be saved
[26:29] today and you continue on and you go
[26:32] back doing the same thing you were doing
[26:37] before don't work like Brother Don said
[26:39] don't work you didn't go on to just to
[26:42] sanctification you didn't go on to the
[26:45] indwelling of the Holy Ghost but now
[26:48] this all covered under the Plan of
[26:49] Redemption so if a baby dies before the
[26:52] age of accountability you could consider
[26:54] them saved because they're saved under
[26:56] the blood of Jesus Christ CH all right
[26:58] and they're giv eternal life they're not
[27:00] born again everybody with me all right
[27:04] they're not bride they're not going to
[27:06] live in a new city sorry it's just
[27:09] that's what I was telling them I want my
[27:10] kids not just saved I want them filled
[27:13] with the Holy Ghost I want them doing
[27:16] things in church I want God to bless
[27:18] them as
[27:19] bride not just barely get them by by the
[27:22] Skin of Their Teeth but you know what
[27:24] I'll take that amen I'll take that that
[27:27] means I'll get to see them for an
[27:28] eternity all right but the Bible says
[27:31] you'll be there with your offsprings in
[27:32] the Millennium that means somewhere down
[27:34] the line they got to get the new birth
[27:35] not just a deathbed confession which
[27:38] that is
[27:39] saved everybody okay with that does
[27:41] everybody understand that's kind of what
[27:43] we were talking about last night but you
[27:45] can be saved and not be born again but
[27:48] you can't be born again and not be saved
[27:49] because the saved part starts you on
[27:51] your journey yes all right now if you're
[27:54] saved and God listen this is all left up
[27:56] to God we were talking about last night
[27:58] brother Brown said God's infinite
[28:00] omnicient I'm the present he knows
[28:02] everything so before you get here he's
[28:04] going to know that you're just going to
[28:06] come to
[28:08] Salvation and and then you you know it's
[28:10] not just like we were talking about last
[28:11] night you don't just get this good
[28:13] feeling or or or or get
[28:18] caught find Jesus in
[28:21] jail then when you get out you leave him
[28:23] in the jail housee amen seen it seen it
[28:27] hundreds of times I've seen it stick but
[28:30] I've seen that now listen if they if
[28:32] they're truly repentant and
[28:35] saved if they die somewhere quickly
[28:37] there it's got to be left up to
[28:41] God but they will not go into Rapture
[28:43] and they're not considered born again
[28:45] and they're not in the sixth Dimension
[28:46] all right so this PL great Plan of
[28:49] Redemption
[28:51] is that where everybody's covered under
[28:55] a Redemption plan we've been talking
[28:57] about about the Plan of Redemption for a
[28:58] long time everyone is covered under that
[29:02] now whether you accept it or not is your
[29:03] business
[29:05] okay but now the Bible tells us when we
[29:08] come to the knowledge of the truth
[29:11] there's no more sacrifice for that all
[29:13] right when you come to the knowledge of
[29:15] the truth you sit in this church and say
[29:16] well I'm saved I'm going to heaven I'd
[29:19] be careful you've been taught different
[29:22] you've been taught to go through the
[29:24] three stages you've been taught that you
[29:27] the cuts off your past sins and puts you
[29:30] what in line to be born again but you're
[29:32] not born again yet all right but God
[29:35] Knows by for knowledge according to
[29:37] Romans
[29:39] 8 according to Romans 8 according to
[29:42] everything else God knows who's going to
[29:43] make it up statue of perfect man
[29:45] therefore he puts it there puts you in a
[29:48] place to get
[29:49] it that's what we were talking about
[29:51] last night you got to remember he has to
[29:53] put you God's obligated to get you here
[29:55] yes sir you're not you have no choice we
[29:57] talked about this a couple sunds ago you
[29:59] have no choice to get
[30:01] here but God got you here through
[30:04] permissive will through your parents and
[30:07] and the other question last night was
[30:09] and somebody asked brother Ram about
[30:11] illegitimate children could they be
[30:13] saved in other words could they go into
[30:15] Rapture well we just kind of broke it
[30:17] down again and and
[30:20] um you take this over
[30:23] here and you see that that when we look
[30:26] at
[30:27] I bastard children in the Old
[30:30] Testament that was so hideous the
[30:32] prophet said the Bible says four
[30:34] generations a 10 Generations 400 years
[30:38] so brother R said great great great
[30:39] great great great he named a bunch of
[30:41] great grandkids couldn't go to
[30:43] church because of that one act of
[30:45] adultery or fornication or living
[30:48] together before you're married and
[30:50] producing a child that child under the
[30:54] blood of bulls and goats he had to bear
[30:56] that or she had to bear that
[30:59] burden of what their mother and father
[31:01] did now me and you uhuh we're on this
[31:04] side of Calvary the blood of Jesus
[31:07] Christ I don't care if you come to the
[31:10] age of accountability you give your
[31:11] heart to God you receive the baptism of
[31:14] the Holy Ghost in your soul you're just
[31:16] as Eternal as God is God doesn't hold
[31:19] that against you he can't cuz he can't
[31:21] remember
[31:24] it so praise God don't worry if my Mom
[31:27] and Daddy was count the years back and
[31:30] make sure they were
[31:31] married you you know I have to be
[31:34] careful sometimes when you say I've born
[31:36] so many years and you look at your kids
[31:37] and your kids are twice you know two
[31:39] years older than that you
[31:41] go
[31:43] so but it makes you think you know
[31:45] because you know what we're humans
[31:46] that's the first thing we think we go
[31:48] something
[31:49] happened well you know what it wasn't
[31:51] the kid's fault never fault the kid God
[31:55] doesn't fault the kid that's right now
[31:57] when that kid comes to the age of
[31:58] accountability and he gets up 12 13 14
[32:00] years old and he looks back and says
[32:02] well I can't make it because I'm a
[32:04] bastor child no no no he's been taught
[32:08] wrong you tell him or her they have just
[32:11] as much opportunity as I do and you do
[32:14] that were born under holy wedlock to
[32:17] make it as anybody else all right is
[32:20] everybody with me that ought to settled
[32:22] a lot of it for for for a lot of people
[32:25] cuz they're all covered under the planet
[32:26] of ber
[32:27] iion God knew that yes sir he knew
[32:33] that for whom he did for o he also did
[32:36] predestinate to be conformed to the
[32:38] image of his son that he might be the
[32:40] firstborn among many Brethren Mor over
[32:43] whom he did what predestinate them he
[32:45] called yes sir and whom he called them
[32:48] he justified and whom he justified them
[32:50] he also glorified the call for John
[32:52] Wesley was was to live a Sanctified life
[32:56] a little bit higher than Martin Luther
[32:59] all right then the Pentecostals come
[33:01] along and they are
[33:03] required are
[33:05] predestinated to stay in the plan of God
[33:08] you have to be predestinated to that
[33:11] plan but it's by choice he saw your
[33:14] choice you saw what you would need he
[33:16] saw today what you would need you would
[33:18] need a certain word and that's what
[33:20] we're going to talk about uh maybe this
[33:22] evening we'll talk about that as good
[33:24] seed going into the good ground we
[33:27] talked about a little bit last night CU
[33:29] what is the seed the seed is the word of
[33:30] God today you came to receive the seed
[33:34] word of God now what you do with it is
[33:37] your business if it come from God I'm
[33:39] telling you if this came from God today
[33:41] it's going to strike your
[33:44] ground your Earth and then what you do
[33:49] with it is going to
[33:51] determine how good it's going to be for
[33:54] you tomorrow and the next day and the
[33:55] next day everybody with me all right
[33:58] didn't the Bible tell us the Bible tells
[34:00] us how Dreadful it is to be in this
[34:03] place the house of
[34:05] God it's for
[34:08] correction but for me when I come I want
[34:12] Deliverance I want to know what I did
[34:14] wrong and I want somebody to expound on
[34:17] it so that I can quit doing what I was
[34:20] doing
[34:21] before is that not what you're here
[34:24] for all right we ain't come to that kind
[34:26] of perfection yet but we're getting
[34:29] there brother BR talks about the basis
[34:32] of free moral agency you can turn it
[34:33] down or accept it so I'm not going to
[34:35] have to read these quotes over again
[34:37] I've read them three or four times we
[34:39] believe that you have a choice yes in
[34:42] what you're doing today you have a
[34:44] choice all right buy a free moral agency
[34:49] and as we were talking about last night
[34:51] moral you see that word moral we just
[34:54] kind of say free moral agency moral is
[34:56] the morality te and then we're going to
[34:58] talk about a horse forehead in just a
[34:59] minute brother John we I'll expound on a
[35:01] little bit more from last night cuz
[35:04] sometimes you do you throw out that word
[35:05] and it's kind of a harsh word and and
[35:08] but there's a meaning behind it go if
[35:10] the Bible says it I'm going to be able
[35:11] to say it well another words I didn't
[35:13] make that word up brother Bri didn't
[35:15] make the word up the word was in the
[35:16] Bible already and Jeremiah was talking
[35:19] about a country or a a a nation called
[35:23] Israel but guess remember what though
[35:25] you and I are spiritual Israel
[35:27] so we have to take the the good and the
[35:29] bad from the Old Testament see the Old
[35:32] Testament was given to tell you give you
[35:36] to condemn you remember brother BR said
[35:38] get you in the pawn shot but couldn't
[35:39] get you out Grace is what got you out of
[35:43] the pawn shop coming over to the New
[35:45] Testament and the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:48] but it didn't take away you being your
[35:49] free moral agency it didn't take that
[35:52] away you're still
[35:55] free morally
[35:58] you're the agent or agency to decide yes
[36:02] and no as brother John was talking about
[36:05] yet you know you listen to God's Nos and
[36:08] you better listen to them them's the
[36:10] best yeses you'll ever get if he says no
[36:13] see remember God's infinite he knows
[36:15] that if he lets you go down that path
[36:17] what will happen to you before you think
[36:19] brother John this is the best job this
[36:21] is what I need to do this is where I
[36:23] need to go I need to live in this
[36:25] $500,000 house this $150,000 house and
[36:28] you know what God will just let you go
[36:30] if you don't re if you really just want
[36:32] to go you just push your way right
[36:34] through it and it'll be a
[36:37] disaster all right I love what brother
[36:40] John's bringing because it molds
[36:41] Christianity and your and your natural
[36:44] life because the Bible tells us here in
[36:46] Peter that this stature of a perfect man
[36:49] is pertaining to life and godliness
[36:53] we'll read that in just a minute your
[36:55] life and godliness all right so we're
[36:58] it's attached you can't like we were
[37:00] talking about last night uh you know the
[37:02] Bible says you know like flee from this
[37:04] and and from such turn away that doesn't
[37:07] mean that if if you you know if you work
[37:10] in a group of heathens and there are all
[37:11] bunch of heathens and they curse and
[37:13] drink and smoke and you're the only
[37:14] Christian in the group well I'm going to
[37:16] quit this job cuz I you know the Lord
[37:19] told no God may have put you in that job
[37:22] to show them that Christianity can be
[37:25] lived
[37:27] amen so you stay
[37:30] there pray to God to give you another
[37:32] one if you want to but if he keeps you
[37:34] there as we were talking about dad last
[37:35] night and the several brothers that were
[37:37] here brother collie and different ones
[37:39] that worked at General Motors with him
[37:41] 1,200 1500 people heathens they were
[37:45] having church service and they didn't
[37:47] walk out of the church service being
[37:49] bless God I'm taking an extra 10 minutes
[37:51] for the
[37:52] Lord right no they stayed under the law
[37:57] of humanity the law of what that um
[38:01] establishment said you get a 15minute
[38:03] break now they didn't take 30 and say
[38:04] well them 15 we shouldn't do that no see
[38:07] they would have
[38:08] lost uh and I'm going to say this cuz
[38:11] I'm going to say something when we get
[38:12] to the end of the
[38:13] service you when you come to some and
[38:16] you you're you're held to a position uh
[38:18] brother Dale was held to a position
[38:20] brother him brother Mo him and brother
[38:21] Mo were kind of held to a position that
[38:23] they were ministers and they were
[38:24] bringing this gospel and they were the
[38:27] 15 minutes instead of eating their lunch
[38:29] they were having church service now what
[38:32] if what if though they were held to this
[38:35] people would see that what if they were
[38:37] held to this and then when they walked
[38:39] out in the parking lot there was brother
[38:41] Dale and brother Mo sit on the back of a
[38:43] truck drinking Budweisers and smoking
[38:46] cigarettes now that never happened you
[38:48] know well those of you on the internet
[38:50] that didn't never happen I'm just saying
[38:52] what if you're held to this position you
[38:56] have a
[38:57] position everybody's going to be
[38:59] watching you and the devil for sure is
[39:02] going to watch you through people to
[39:03] make you try to fall or to lose your
[39:09] testimony but when you keep seeing day
[39:12] after day after day you living just a
[39:15] normal life but it's different it it's
[39:17] it's Christianity the way it's supposed
[39:19] to be not some not some emotion or not
[39:22] some um you know and I'll read it in
[39:25] just a minute we'll talk about the horse
[39:26] forehead and it really fits with
[39:28] today all right that was written by
[39:30] Jeremiah some 4,000 and something years
[39:33] ago but it's for today yes cuz I'll read
[39:37] what it is I I know some of you don't
[39:38] know what it is but I'm going to read it
[39:39] to you and it'll tell
[39:42] you pretty much what Jeremiah Was talk
[39:45] or God was doing talking about through
[39:46] Jeremiah brother M says in time of
[39:48] decision I really like this
[39:52] because this takes care of you saying
[39:55] well I can't be any other way but this
[39:57] God's going to pull me through a tube
[39:58] God's going to he's predetermined that
[40:00] this is what I do brother Braham said
[40:03] now you got to make up your mind you've
[40:05] got to make a choice and this may be
[40:08] your last time to make a choice now he's
[40:10] given an altar call all right he's
[40:12] giving an altar call but it's working
[40:15] today same as it did back then and this
[40:19] may be your last time to make a choice
[40:22] excuse me tomorrow may be too late God
[40:25] might have ch you now look God chose
[40:28] everybody to eternal life God would that
[40:31] all be saved
[40:33] amen we know he just died for the bride
[40:36] we know he just died for certain people
[40:38] but but before
[40:41] that Jesus knew he was there for a
[40:44] purpose and only a certain group of
[40:45] people would have it but God the Father
[40:49] even from the Old Testament all down he
[40:51] said hey I'll give eternal life to
[40:52] whoever wants it all right believe in my
[40:55] son believing in Jesus Christ God might
[40:59] God might have chose you to eternal life
[41:01] now you think man if God chose me to
[41:02] eternal life I'm some of this great
[41:04] something and I'm bride and I'm this and
[41:06] I'm
[41:07] that God might have chose you to eternal
[41:10] life but if you don't make up your mind
[41:12] and accept it somebody else will take
[41:15] your
[41:16] place amen somebody else will take your
[41:22] place that's kind of a wow quote there
[41:25] wow somebody else will take your place
[41:27] yeah I can see that cuz God's going to
[41:30] move
[41:31] on if you don't want to move with him
[41:33] you're here he's keep he's going he's
[41:36] going to find somebody come on people
[41:39] he's going to find somebody that'll
[41:40] worship him right he's going to find
[41:42] somebody that says that ain't nothing
[41:44] but the truth every word of God is right
[41:47] that's what we're talking about when we
[41:48] talk about godliness it's not something
[41:50] that we live sinless Perfection there's
[41:53] no way you can do that prophet of God
[41:55] tells us he said this this thing will be
[41:56] sticky until the
[41:58] change you still got that nature you got
[42:01] to deal with that you were born in the
[42:03] world with memories and conscious
[42:04] effects and
[42:05] Imagination but the Bible tells us in
[42:07] Philippians through Paul that you may be
[42:10] what blameless and harmless we blame
[42:12] oursel every
[42:14] day when we going to get to see though
[42:16] that God doesn't hold that the same way
[42:20] we hold
[42:21] it the sons of God without rebuke in the
[42:25] midst
[42:27] in other words let me rephrase that in
[42:29] the midst of rubbing shoulders with the
[42:33] world are a perverse Nation among whom
[42:37] you
[42:38] shine as lights in the
[42:41] world that's why Genesis 17 when he
[42:44] talking about Abram Abram was 99 years
[42:46] old the Lord appeared to Abram he wasn't
[42:49] even Abraham yet and he said I am the
[42:51] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[42:54] complete be th thou perfect in other
[42:57] words Abraham do what I ask you to
[43:01] do and he did right so look that means
[43:05] one who lacks nothing in physical
[43:07] strength or beauty sound or
[43:09] wholesomeness complete look morally
[43:14] innocent try that in the end
[43:17] time and having Integrity like I said
[43:20] before if you got a position that's why
[43:21] I always say if you got a position in
[43:23] this church you should be at every
[43:25] meeting you should be at every function
[43:28] you why because people are looking at
[43:29] you and if you're not there and you're
[43:31] supposed to be on this position right
[43:33] here and you're not there you lose all
[43:36] credibility all
[43:38] credibility so if you don't want that
[43:40] position you can give it to somebody
[43:42] else just simple as
[43:45] that all
[43:47] right one who is morally and ethically
[43:50] pure now watch this we looked at the how
[43:53] we going to get this we're going to get
[43:55] it through through the five-fold
[43:56] ministry we're going to get it through
[43:58] preaching we're going to get it through
[43:59] the Bible tells us in Ephesians the
[44:00] perfecting of the
[44:03] Saints All Of Us
[44:05] Together which means completely
[44:07] Furnishing not making you a god zombie
[44:10] as I was talking about the other night
[44:12] it's not something that you know you got
[44:14] you're this robot you're this artificial
[44:16] intelligence and it's just all
[44:17] God we're coming to that we will be that
[44:21] when we get on the other side but we're
[44:23] on this side today we're still dealing
[44:26] with the born in sin part the the
[44:28] shaping in iniquity part everybody with
[44:31] me but we're going to realize one day
[44:33] that that's got to come out of us and
[44:36] overtake that part that Mom and Daddy
[44:38] brought
[44:40] here who's our worst
[44:43] enemy
[44:45] yourself I am my worst
[44:47] enemy so don't blame others blame
[44:50] yourself right second Peter 1 says
[44:53] according as he divine power this is
[44:55] where we've been reading on statute of
[44:57] perfect man he's given unto us all
[44:59] things that look pertain unto life and
[45:02] godliness so it's your life that you

[45:38] it's going to happen when they leave

[45:42] were unless you decide to change unless
[45:46] you decide to hang on every word like
[45:48] it's the last sermon you'll ever hear
[45:52] and I need
[45:53] that to get to heaven then you'll then
[45:56] you'll keep yourself awake it is hot up
[45:57] here though Aaron's not here to regulate
[45:59] the the U the Heat or the cool part but
[46:03] this whole thing pertains to life and
[46:05] godliness so we're not just coming in
[46:07] here and say well just going to be the
[46:08] godliest people in the world listen if
[46:11] you'll live like
[46:14] that let God live through you like that
[46:18] amen but don't try to do it yourself
[46:21] don't try to stick peacock Fe I mean
[46:23] yeah peacock feathers and and if you're
[46:25] still a buzzard that's right and have
[46:27] y'all seen as many
[46:29] buzzards I don't know I must be I must
[46:31] be you know my mail route it's like
[46:34] going through herds of them and you're
[46:36] trying to you know they're in there's 20
[46:38] of them on the road and and they're
[46:40] eating one little bless their heart one
[46:42] little squirrel that died and they're
[46:43] all trying to eat him you know and
[46:44] there's 20 of them and when you drive up
[46:47] I hit one the other day I hit his tail
[46:49] but have you ever seen that many you
[46:51] know they're fixing to eat all these
[46:52] people it's going to die I guess I don't
[46:54] know where by are given unto us exceeded
[46:57] they're ugly too great and precious
[46:59] promises that by what these promises
[47:01] that we're talking about today you might
[47:03] be partakers of the divine nature now
[47:05] listen that's our
[47:07] goal is partake of the divine nature of
[47:09] God not our own nature listen if you're
[47:12] used and good and yourself is just
[47:14] really good you need a new
[47:17] birth you need to be born
[47:20] again and besides this giving all
[47:23] diligence add and we got to Godliness
[47:25] here
[47:26] we'll get to this real quick godliness
[47:28] means what reverence respect piety
[47:31] towards God now remember we're going to
[47:33] talk about horse forehead but stop just
[47:36] a second you can't find that in the
[47:38] world
[47:40] today people are so
[47:43] irreverent
[47:46] unrespectful and they just think God's
[47:49] whatever he wants to be LGB or
[47:52] t you know I mean he's and and put him
[47:55] in a pull pit and that's what we're
[47:56] going to talk about a horse forehead
[47:58] because God saw that that that's what
[48:00] would happen in the end time it's just
[48:01] now it's just now where where even they
[48:05] have no respect for ministers used to
[48:07] you know you'd have a little bit of
[48:08] respect for ministers and I mean you I
[48:10] don't go around like Brother D says you
[48:12] know uh preachers that used to you know
[48:15] say oh bless God I'm a preacher put me
[48:16] where they don't smoke you know I you
[48:18] don't do that but but now they just say
[48:21] whatever they want to around you used to
[48:23] you know they wouldn't they wouldn't
[48:24] curse if it's around daddy or anything
[48:26] like that you know when we go to places
[48:29] to hunt and all but after the last
[48:31] couple of
[48:32] years they just slip right back in
[48:35] listen you're going to be who you
[48:37] are you are going today this day is
[48:41] manifesting time you've got to you can't
[48:44] hide it for years it's going to come out
[48:49] today today you're going to prove who
[48:52] you
[48:53] are amen if if you believe that then you
[48:56] need to look at
[48:58] yourself and say am I just
[49:00] saved or am I Born Again so we get back
[49:03] to the point we were talking about last
[49:06] night brother Ms look if you got genuine
[49:08] Faith then put genuine virtue to it
[49:11] knowledge Temperance now he says genuine
[49:13] you're moving right on up the line all
[49:15] right fifthly add godliness oh my
[49:18] godliness to be added what does
[49:20] godliness mean okay looks in several
[49:22] dictionaries and it means to what to be
[49:24] like God all right pretty
[49:27] simple but now look he said after you
[49:29] get Faith got faith virtue knowledge
[49:32] Temperance patience then be like
[49:35] God all right you say I can't do that
[49:38] brother brandham all right everybody
[49:39] believe brother Bram was a prophet
[49:41] everybody believe that what he said
[49:43] we're supposed to do right he is the
[49:46] final Authority the final voice of the
[49:48] final age we are but it's under our
[49:50] Prophet messenger and what he said about
[49:52] us and to us right he said oh yes you
[49:55] can
[49:56] abely amen oh yes you
[50:01] can he didn't stumble
[50:03] around they said I can't do it brother
[50:06] brandom oh yes you can you can't do it
[50:08] oh yes you
[50:10] can you got to want
[50:15] to then he's talkinging about a few
[50:16] scriptures reading all the virtue all
[50:18] the things that in God is in you all
[50:22] right be therefore p r f c is that
[50:25] perfect in other words complete all
[50:28] right you get way up here before you're
[50:31] asked to do it though God is mindful of
[50:33] all of us that when we're babies we're
[50:36] babies when we're babies we can't handle
[50:39] stuff like we did before all
[50:44] right see some of you kids running
[50:46] around outside and I'm like man you know
[50:49] give them about five or six years and
[50:50] they won't be doing that give them about
[50:52] 20 years and they sure won't be doing
[50:53] that all right but a baby's a baby
[50:56] though but that baby's going to grow up
[50:58] yes sir and when that baby grows up the
[51:01] attitude needs to
[51:04] change naturally and spiritually all
[51:08] these things has to be added first so
[51:10] brother M is giv us the total
[51:11] prescription of what to do then when you
[51:13] get up here he's asked you now to be
[51:17] perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of
[51:20] God how many things you could say on
[51:22] that so let's go back to what we're
[51:24] talking about without controversy so
[51:26] when we start talking about this
[51:27] godliness there's no controversy well I
[51:29] can't but no there's not well I can't
[51:31] but the prophet of God said yes you can
[51:36] sir it's just whether you want to bad
[51:39] enough or
[51:39] not because all that live Godly in
[51:42] Christ what will suffer
[51:46] persecution right that's what we're
[51:48] heading to that's what kill Jesus they
[51:50] didn't kill him for his good
[51:52] works they killed him because he said he
[51:54] was godone right yes ain't that what
[51:57] they told him we don't kill you for that
[51:59] we love your healing programs we love
[52:01] your your Ware programs where you can
[52:03] take five fishes or two loaves and five
[52:05] fishes and or vice versa and and feed
[52:08] 10,000 people we love that but don't
[52:10] tell us you're
[52:13] God and that's the same thing today
[52:16] because you get that same thing you
[52:17] ain't perfect I ain't perfect everything
[52:19] is kind of molded and meshed together in
[52:21] this age all right but you and I are
[52:25] told to stand above
[52:28] that everybody with me all
[52:31] right First Corinthians
[52:34] 11:32 says but when we are judged this
[52:37] is what the scripture we read for
[52:39] communion but when we are judged we are
[52:43] chastened of the Lord now watch here's
[52:45] your separation that we should not be
[52:48] condemned with the
[52:51] world all right Paul's telling them said
[52:53] you need to do this
[52:55] and when you're chastened of the Lord
[52:58] through a five-fold Ministry through a
[53:00] prophet messenger tapes and books every
[53:02] how you want to do it that we should not
[53:04] be condemned with the world because we
[53:06] know the world is condemned the cosmos
[53:09] the world order now he didn't say take
[53:11] us out of it he just said he separate us
[53:15] where we won't be condemned with the
[53:17] world all right in other words we've
[53:19] been instructed on how to do it and we
[53:22] read that list on Wednesday night and
[53:23] I'm gonna read it again
[53:26] because when we come to Godliness we
[53:28] can't again we can't look at our faults
[53:32] we can't look at our failures we can't
[53:34] look at the things that that that that
[53:36] sometimes you can't help the things you
[53:39] do cuz you're I I could I could try to
[53:41] be quiet like Sister Barbara and it'd
[53:44] kill
[53:46] me but Don it wasn't that funny it's
[53:49] pretty funny
[53:51] okay it would be a disaster if I tried
[53:55] to be quiet as Sister Barbara bless her
[53:58] heart or car she was trying to get to
[53:59] church bless her heart it's good to see
[54:01] all y'all back again y'all
[54:03] too and uh but but I just can't that
[54:07] ain't me God didn't make everybody to be
[54:10] quiet I thought Lenny a said he said why
[54:13] do you somebody asked said why do you
[54:14] sing he said I sing for those who can
[54:15] and those who
[54:18] can't God's given me the gift the same
[54:20] for those who can't and for those who
[54:23] can so I kind of like that that all
[54:26] right but you got to take that apart
[54:28] though and say hey now God used
[54:32] this so let's look at some of these a
[54:36] list of
[54:38] things now listen the world is condemned
[54:41] all right you with me just just a few
[54:43] minutes the world is
[54:46] condemned we're supposed to be not
[54:48] condemned with the
[54:50] world right so now we look at the world
[54:54] but now we we look at the world now as
[54:56] the world looks at the world it's okay
[54:59] for women to wear pants and it's okay
[55:01] now for even to wear them in a sanctuary
[55:03] it's okay for a woman to stand up in a
[55:05] pull pit and preach with a pair of pants
[55:08] on with hair short as mine that is
[55:10] Christianity to the world that's
[55:13] condemnation that will not
[55:16] be
[55:18] fruitful oh it may be in natural things
[55:21] they they may preach prosperity and and
[55:24] you know everybody's going to get money
[55:26] if you do this or send me some first
[55:28] though yeah yeah but we're away from
[55:32] that we know that we've been taught that
[55:34] that's not it that's right so we sisters
[55:38] don't cut our hair because the Bible
[55:41] tells us that it's an Abomination
[55:44] brother brandham even comes and he
[55:46] expounds and
[55:47] says if you cut your
[55:50] hair sisters your husband has a right to
[55:53] put you away
[55:55] for dishonoring your head and that's
[55:59] what the Bible says actually it wasn't
[56:00] it brother brandham said it the Bible
[56:02] said it first you dishonor your head if
[56:06] you cut your hair now look so now what
[56:08] does that do that separates about 1% of
[56:10] us that don't to the 99% that do and and
[56:14] they're covered under their
[56:16] Christianity all right but we're not
[56:19] going to be condemned with that if we
[56:21] don't do
[56:22] it amen amen right right and you know
[56:27] whether you've cut your hair or
[56:29] not so but that'll be your condemnation
[56:33] because you will be condemned with the
[56:35] world the Bible says it's an Abomination
[56:38] to put on a garment pertaining to man
[56:41] now we are we good here all right if you
[56:44] don't do that then guess what you've
[56:46] moved over to this Godly side and
[56:50] removed yourself from this ungodly side
[56:53] because the Bible says it's an
[56:57] Abomination to God to put on a pair of
[57:01] pants is everybody with me so you so
[57:04] you've taken
[57:05] yourself and put yourself in the
[57:07] godliness
[57:09] part all right hairdress actions manner
[57:13] of life I hope and pray uh and I know
[57:19] there's some are not here today but
[57:23] you've got these big groups and big
[57:25] programs in different churches for
[57:29] divorcees hang on I'm not going to bash
[57:31] anybody don't get nervous about marriage
[57:33] and divorce I'm going to make a point
[57:36] but it's common to them it's common to
[57:38] not work out your problems go ahead and
[57:40] get a divorce cuz maybe you're already
[57:42] fooling around with somebody anyway
[57:43] hello
[57:45] somebody all right now I hope we're not
[57:49] worrying about that in this church
[57:51] Hallelujah I hope that we don't have to
[57:54] have a Planned
[57:59] Parenthood or a singles
[58:03] group where they teach you how to
[58:05] worship and love God in a divorced
[58:09] condition now listen if you're divorced
[58:11] listen I'm not I'm telling you this is
[58:13] what they do over
[58:15] here and they call it godliness they
[58:17] call it helping people because they got
[58:19] people in our congregation that's
[58:21] fighting and fussing and committing
[58:22] adultery and XYZ and they day you can't
[58:25] get their stuff worked together and
[58:26] they're just going to
[58:28] divorce well let's go back to the
[58:32] Bible only one way a woman can divorce
[58:36] there is no way a woman can divorce a
[58:39] man no
[58:41] way unless he's dead and that's not a
[58:44] divorce that's dying and marrying again
[58:47] so we've been instructed then how to
[58:49] come over into this godliness group and
[58:52] not be covered in this condemned group
[58:54] right everybody with me so see now
[58:57] godliness
[58:59] now I believe we're living it I think I
[59:02] think what we're doing is we're living
[59:04] it but we don't think we
[59:06] are everybody with me we're expecting
[59:10] this great I don't have any bad
[59:16] thoughts not going to happen but if you
[59:19] see the condemnation of the world and
[59:21] you read the Bible it says to not do
[59:24] this and if you're doing it you're
[59:25] condemned that's right if you're not
[59:28] doing it you're
[59:30] not you've come out of that that's right
[59:32] come out of what her that church that
[59:36] denomination that whes
[59:39] forehead and listen we don't need an
[59:42] Alcoholics Anonymous program in this
[59:44] church we don't need a smokers Anonymous
[59:46] in this church we don't need a Gamblers
[59:48] Anonymous in this church but some
[59:51] Churches
[59:52] do sad to say amen that's Christianity
[59:56] to them right we don't believe in
[1:00:00] AA we believe in Deliverance absolutely
[1:00:03] cuz AA tells you once an alcoholic
[1:00:05] always an alcoholic no you get born
[1:00:08] again you will never be an alcoholic
[1:00:11] again that part of you is gone sir but
[1:00:14] see the world can't they can't think the
[1:00:17] way you think so that puts us in that
[1:00:20] godliness
[1:00:22] group everybody okay with that yeah I I
[1:00:25] think it's something that's
[1:00:26] insurmountable so much that when we say
[1:00:28] godliness we think I can't never do that
[1:00:31] brother Brown said what yes you can if
[1:00:34] you'll go about it the right way all
[1:00:37] right so let's look at this horse
[1:00:38] forehead real quick and then we'll close
[1:00:40] right here we won't get too far we can
[1:00:41] finish a little bit more of it tonight
[1:00:44] or this afternoon all right listen this
[1:00:47] is a strong word and I know we got young
[1:00:49] kids in here but it's what the Bible
[1:00:51] says because as we were talking about
[1:00:53] last night you got you got to
[1:00:55] remember we're going to look at this
[1:00:57] word it's a little bit different
[1:01:00] than a prostitute because a prostitute
[1:01:02] charges a is just a loose woman or
[1:01:05] a
[1:01:07] man well get quiet but you need to
[1:01:09] explain that to your kids if you don't
[1:01:11] hadn't already because the Bible tells
[1:01:13] us that in Jeremiah therefore the
[1:01:15] showers have been withholden look the
[1:01:17] showers what is it former and latter
[1:01:20] rain former rain teacher rain latter
[1:01:21] rain is Harvest rain it's talking spirit
[1:01:25] in other words I am withholding your
[1:01:28] blessings because you're doing this
[1:01:30] right here Israel You're My Children
[1:01:33] you're my wife but I'm fixing to divorce
[1:01:35] you cuz you have a horse forehead you
[1:01:38] have went and committed adultery with
[1:01:40] someone
[1:01:42] else and there hath been no latter of
[1:01:45] rain and thou Hast a whse forehead right
[1:01:49] here thou refuses to be ashamed
[1:01:57] bless God it don't matter what I wear to
[1:02:01] church bless God it doesn't matter how
[1:02:03] much I cut my hair bless God it doesn't
[1:02:06] matter how much I drink God just loves
[1:02:08] me anyway he does love you but he loves
[1:02:12] his word more than he loves
[1:02:15] you because that's who he
[1:02:18] is you can't he can't love you like you
[1:02:21] think he loves you and go against his
[1:02:23] word can't do that therefore the showers
[1:02:27] have been withhold and there ha been no
[1:02:28] light or rain thou Hast a horse forehead
[1:02:31] thou refuses to be ashamed now last
[1:02:34] night we were talking about I want you
[1:02:36] when you when you think about that word
[1:02:38] what do you think about a loose
[1:02:41] woman or a loose man someone that can't
[1:02:43] control theirself someone that's that's
[1:02:45] um uh sexually promiscuous okay
[1:02:48] everybody with me all
[1:02:52] right look at this definition
[1:02:57] the definition of that word in the
[1:02:59] Hebrew lexican is highly fed and
[1:03:03] therefore
[1:03:04] wanting highly fed I'll raise it up so
[1:03:07] y'all can see it above the piano highly
[1:03:10] fed and therefore wanting in other words
[1:03:14] can't control their self wants to eat
[1:03:17] all the time has to be partaking of
[1:03:22] something all the time
[1:03:26] and wanting with it in other words
[1:03:28] there's no
[1:03:29] barrier whatever goes and that's what
[1:03:31] they're doing in churches now whatever
[1:03:33] goes that's what it is if it's a trend
[1:03:35] that's what we're doing that's why the
[1:03:37] Methodist church thank God there are
[1:03:39] some and I believe God will stand for
[1:03:40] those people that stand for what they
[1:03:42] believe and keep those women and LGBT
[1:03:45] out of the pull pit but now there is a
[1:03:47] group that says not we're pulling away
[1:03:49] and that's what we're fine God God's
[1:03:51] good God loves everybody yeah we going
[1:03:55] to find that out when he when he becomes
[1:03:57] a just God at the white Throne judgment
[1:03:59] you going to find out how loving you
[1:04:01] think God is all right so strongs
[1:04:06] means highly fed and therefore wanting
[1:04:08] it also does to mean to commit
[1:04:10] fornication or be a harlot because
[1:04:12] remember you got to look in the Book of
[1:04:14] Revelations where there's what there's a
[1:04:16] mother and there's daughters are
[1:04:20] harlots that's the hor forehead but
[1:04:22] watch to be unfaithful
[1:04:26] to be
[1:04:27] unfaithful Jeremiah says you become
[1:04:30] Unfaithful Israel but the whole problem
[1:04:34] is they don't
[1:04:36] care they don't
[1:04:38] mind they have no conscience of right
[1:04:41] and wrong oh actually they don't have no
[1:04:43] conscience of wrong a't that what today
[1:04:46] is people have no conscience of wrong
[1:04:48] that's why they'll kill8 and 10 20
[1:04:50] people that's why there'll be mass
[1:04:51] shooting that's why the the husband will
[1:04:53] kill the wife and and vice
[1:04:57] versa y'all see the other day that
[1:04:59] really nice she's some kind of self-help
[1:05:01] person or does something and and she was
[1:05:03] bragging on her kid and bragging on her
[1:05:05] husband they got her in jail now for
[1:05:07] killing her husband poisoned
[1:05:11] him watch
[1:05:15] out but see that's what the world's got
[1:05:17] to watch
[1:05:19] out see the world has got to watch out
[1:05:21] for
[1:05:23] that because that's the mentality of the
[1:05:27] world
[1:05:28] right we don't have that
[1:05:31] mentality I hope Zach don't have to look
[1:05:34] at his food and make sure this and Lily
[1:05:37] walks out the
[1:05:41] door but you understand that's what the
[1:05:43] world that's what they always got that
[1:05:45] worry you should never have that worry
[1:05:48] if you're worried about stuff like that
[1:05:50] you need to get born
[1:05:53] again so now the forehead means the brow
[1:05:56] or what right here what's Expos right
[1:05:58] here in other words you're Forward
[1:06:02] Thinking so you're wanting you you eat a
[1:06:06] lot you can't control yourself and
[1:06:09] everybody can see
[1:06:13] it let's
[1:06:15] look now brother R didn't say anything
[1:06:18] about a horse forehead he just made a he
[1:06:19] just read the
[1:06:21] scripture but I looked online and uh
[1:06:24] some several commentaries and and excuse
[1:06:26] me for reading them they're not from
[1:06:28] brother brandham they're from and I
[1:06:29] didn't put the guy's name down because
[1:06:30] it doesn't matter cuz I feel by the Holy
[1:06:32] Spirit I looked at it through my filter
[1:06:34] and it seems like it was right all right
[1:06:36] this is used in the Bible as an analogy
[1:06:39] for a person group the nation of Israel
[1:06:42] in Jeremiah's case are a
[1:06:46] church who has broken all meaning of
[1:06:50] integrity so
[1:06:53] severely
[1:06:54] they no longer recognize the damage or
[1:06:58] the evil of their
[1:07:02] actions it doesn't matter what the Bible
[1:07:05] says about pants I'm going to wear them
[1:07:08] anyway oh that's Old Testament stuff
[1:07:10] well let's talk about the New Testament
[1:07:12] stuff The Cutting of the hair the
[1:07:14] drinking the smoking the cussing um not
[1:07:17] coming to church I mean people in the
[1:07:18] world now I was talking to one girl she
[1:07:21] said well we can't have seconds we we
[1:07:23] quit having seconds service I said
[1:07:24] because of Co you should know because
[1:07:26] people quit
[1:07:27] coming about true
[1:07:30] here maybe you get enough first time I
[1:07:33] don't
[1:07:36] know a church who has broken now church
[1:07:38] is a what a
[1:07:40] body but you make up that body all right
[1:07:45] they no longer recognize the damage or
[1:07:47] the evil of the action and that same way
[1:07:49] with all of us oh that's all right I can
[1:07:52] just do this because all right it is a
[1:07:56] relevant term today describing how the
[1:07:59] average person's sense of wri and wrong
[1:08:02] has been warped right from what is
[1:08:05] natural is that not this
[1:08:07] world this has led to the destruction of
[1:08:10] marriage massive numbers of fatherless
[1:08:13] homes and bastard births 30% to Upward
[1:08:16] of 80% illegitimacy rate in some group
[1:08:21] wow they just don't care anymore you
[1:08:24] know when I was growing up if if the
[1:08:26] girl if a girl had was got pregnant
[1:08:28] before she got married they hauled her
[1:08:30] off she got I mean she was gone all
[1:08:33] right just say it now it's just
[1:08:36] everybody just you married no but we
[1:08:39] yeah we're
[1:08:41] good no it's not it God didn't ever make
[1:08:44] a provision for that it's still
[1:08:48] wrong but we have accepted it and
[1:08:51] there's a lot of things that sister
[1:08:53] Trudy um callings we were talking about
[1:08:55] last night a lot of this we can't throw
[1:08:57] to the m to the out there in the
[1:08:59] denominations anymore it's
[1:09:01] here it's things we accept and we let
[1:09:04] things get by that we usually would not
[1:09:07] have let get by
[1:09:08] before open and increasing sexual
[1:09:11] perversion homosexuality pedophilia
[1:09:14] transvestites beastality pornography
[1:09:16] adultery prostitution and the
[1:09:18] sexualization of young children
[1:09:20] especially girls all right these
[1:09:23] passages all have a similar context they
[1:09:26] were written just prior to the fall and
[1:09:28] scattering of either Israel to the North
[1:09:31] or Judah to the South each shows a
[1:09:33] wealthy
[1:09:36] people that not us a wealthy people
[1:09:41] unblinkingly focused on their
[1:09:46] pleasure giving no thought to God they
[1:09:49] are casually uninterested in the moral
[1:09:53] where well welfare of their nation that
[1:09:55] is crashing into utter depravity shame
[1:09:59] for sin has disappeared and that's
[1:10:02] exactly the
[1:10:03] truth shame for S it's no shame to sin
[1:10:06] anymore you know why cuz Satan said well
[1:10:08] it's all right everybody else does
[1:10:11] it I mean how can you read the
[1:10:14] Bible even even our our precious
[1:10:17] neighbor down lives besid Daddy and him
[1:10:20] he said how can you read the
[1:10:22] Bible and let something like that in
[1:10:24] your pull pit he's talking about the
[1:10:27] LGBT cuz he's a Methodist how could you
[1:10:30] do that it's still written in the
[1:10:32] Bible in every translation it stayed the
[1:10:34] same it's an Abomination but they have
[1:10:37] accepted it that's right but they'll be
[1:10:40] condemned with the
[1:10:41] world we are not condemned with the
[1:10:45] world because of our
[1:10:47] godliness cuz we're acting closer to God
[1:10:50] than anybody on the face of this Earth
[1:10:53] cuz we've been taught
[1:10:55] right the interpreter's commentary of
[1:10:57] the Bible states that the Bible shows
[1:10:59] that in the period before these nations
[1:11:01] fa think about this nation ready to fall
[1:11:03] their society show significant breakdown
[1:11:06] in two areas political and business
[1:11:09] leadership and family life with specific
[1:11:13] blame falling on women all right in
[1:11:17] these passages the following
[1:11:18] characteristics are either directly
[1:11:20] named or strongly implied watch look
[1:11:22] Rebellion
[1:11:24] obstinacy
[1:11:26] betrayal distrust shamelessness and
[1:11:30] greed comprising an audacious self
[1:11:33] centeredness against God and fellow man
[1:11:36] now that didn't talk about brotherly
[1:11:37] kindness does it all right these are not
[1:11:41] the characteristics of a nation that
[1:11:42] would bring honor to God that's not a
[1:11:45] characteriz a characteristic that bring
[1:11:48] to this nation
[1:11:50] Amen to honor God at one time in in the
[1:11:53] history of this nation the overwhelming
[1:11:55] majority of people expressed a strong
[1:11:57] sense of Shame when they sin can't you
[1:12:00] remember that
[1:12:01] am strong sense of Shame and
[1:12:04] sorrowfulness and
[1:12:06] repentance they ain't got to repent for
[1:12:08] anything now they put everything that
[1:12:10] was listed to be repented of over here
[1:12:12] they put it over here as it's all right
[1:12:13] to do
[1:12:16] amen so that's the horse forehead that's
[1:12:19] what that means it's it's you have come
[1:12:21] to a place where you don't care if your
[1:12:22] neighbor knows your or you your
[1:12:24] daddy knows you a or anybody know
[1:12:26] they don't care I'm a
[1:12:28] I'm Mist I'm Baptist I'm
[1:12:31] Presbyterian I'm
[1:12:33] bromite overwhelming majority of people
[1:12:36] Express a strong sense of Shame when
[1:12:37] they sin it's in other words don't away
[1:12:39] with sin was an ugly thing and due to
[1:12:42] this sense of Shame they did whatever
[1:12:44] they could to hide their moral flaws
[1:12:45] from others now they
[1:12:47] don't but he said some of that still
[1:12:49] exist the period of 1950s and early 60s
[1:12:52] however was probably the beginning of
[1:12:54] the end of that attitude sin was
[1:12:56] gradually carried less of a stigma and
[1:12:59] the sense of Shame has been slowly
[1:13:01] replaced by a growing boldness of
[1:13:05] attitude a flaunting of
[1:13:09] sin now have we come to
[1:13:16] that much of that sense of Shame has
[1:13:18] disappeared from the American psyche
[1:13:21] some remains in a small percentage
[1:13:26] hello some remains there's some Grace
[1:13:30] yes and a small percentage of the
[1:13:33] population yet increasingly bold
[1:13:36] immorality has become the way of life so
[1:13:40] that sin is now blatantly
[1:13:43] committed because it's all lumped over
[1:13:46] here you can go to church and do all
[1:13:48] these things right here and you're fine
[1:13:52] no God godliness brings you out over
[1:13:55] here and teaches you that you can live
[1:13:58] Godly in Christ but you're going to
[1:14:00] suffer persecution from this group as it
[1:14:04] gets exceedingly bigger right used to it
[1:14:08] might have been
[1:14:09] equal now it's heaped over on this side
[1:14:13] because we just let it go that's
[1:14:18] why you can't get
[1:14:21] perfected by that's in
[1:14:26] play you got to have somebody stand in
[1:14:28] front of you and tell you what you doing
[1:14:34] wrong you got to have somebody to preach
[1:14:37] the gospel to you to perfect you away
[1:14:40] from this group over here amen you got
[1:14:43] to have that you know why cuz God saw
[1:14:46] that's the only way we would get it and
[1:14:49] really get
[1:14:50] it civility is becoming a thing of the
[1:14:54] past rudess and
[1:14:57] open Brazen
[1:15:00] misconduct is becoming the normal way of
[1:15:02] doing things that's right this is the
[1:15:05] kind of conduct of horse forehead
[1:15:06] pictures it represents the blatant
[1:15:09] audacious sin of the street walker who
[1:15:12] is out in public openly displaying what
[1:15:14] she is in other words walking through
[1:15:16] Walmart with her well most nothing on in
[1:15:20] Walmart openly displaying what she is
[1:15:25] promoting herself yes not
[1:15:29] ashamed and tempting others to engage
[1:15:32] with
[1:15:33] her the horse forehead represents
[1:15:37] obdurate practice of sin done overtly
[1:15:40] with no attempt to
[1:15:43] camouflage this attitude is reminiscent
[1:15:45] of the story of righteous lot dealing
[1:15:47] with the homosexuals in Sodom just
[1:15:48] before God dropped the fire and
[1:15:50] brimstone on the people of that B City
[1:15:54] so that's what a horse forehead is it is
[1:15:56] blatantly saying hey Lord I it doesn't
[1:15:59] matter what the Bible says this is what
[1:16:02] my denomination says this is what my
[1:16:04] teacher says this is what my whatever
[1:16:06] this is this is what I think right this
[1:16:09] is what I think no it's What God Says
[1:16:13] and that's it that's the whole thing
[1:16:16] it's what God says we're going to put it
[1:16:17] at that and leave it at
[1:16:21] that you love the Lord yes sir so we're
[1:16:24] talking about life and godliness we're
[1:16:26] talking about uh we'll get to deity this
[1:16:28] afternoon because listen the only way
[1:16:31] you can live this Godly life is that
[1:16:34] something Godly must be inside of
[1:16:37] you can't do it yourself because you are
[1:16:40] that group over here you've been called
[1:16:42] out of that group you ought to be happy
[1:16:46] that God at least called you whether you
[1:16:48] come out your
[1:16:51] business but if you live Godly you will
[1:16:54] suffer persecution we'll read that this
[1:16:56] afternoon you love the Lord amen I want
[1:17:00] to talk to you for just a
[1:17:02] minute on a couple of things just
[1:17:04] to
[1:17:06] um try to get my notes together
[1:17:09] here now I
[1:17:14] appreciate
[1:17:17] everybody in this building all right I
[1:17:21] do and it's because
[1:17:24] of a lot of you most of you I've come to
[1:17:28] be I believe closer to
[1:17:31] God all right because God puts people
[1:17:33] and I'm not talking about bad people I'm
[1:17:34] talking about put people in your life to
[1:17:36] help you all
[1:17:38] right and then when whatever happened to
[1:17:41] to brother Dale that we we see that he's
[1:17:43] not been preaching all right so I have
[1:17:46] been given the opportunity
[1:17:48] to not take over but to assist in trying
[1:17:53] to help all of us as a group and
[1:17:56] individually okay and and and I'm not
[1:17:58] here for a vote of doing a good job or a
[1:18:00] bad job CU I know I've done a bad job
[1:18:03] but I want to ask you a
[1:18:05] question as long as I stand in this pull
[1:18:08] pit there's certain things that I like
[1:18:10] to
[1:18:11] do right I like to have special
[1:18:15] meetings I think they're
[1:18:17] valuable I think that if we don't we
[1:18:20] become so inclusive that we have no
[1:18:25] Fellowship okay so that's why I have and
[1:18:29] I'm sorry if I strain your you know your
[1:18:31] lifestyle that's why I've tried to have
[1:18:34] special meetings at least maybe once a
[1:18:35] month twice a month or for sure have
[1:18:39] something for the Youth and I believe
[1:18:41] it's work um someone came to me one time
[1:18:45] a year or so ago and said well we're
[1:18:47] having too many of them all right of
[1:18:50] course it wasn't a kid was an older
[1:18:51] person
[1:18:53] so I we decide now to do it every other
[1:18:56] the third Saturday of every other month
[1:18:59] and I announced this and it's it's there
[1:19:01] I don't announce it 15 minutes before
[1:19:03] the service starts right I try to
[1:19:05] announce it three months or two months
[1:19:08] before we have any kind of special
[1:19:10] meeting and sometimes longer than that
[1:19:13] everybody with me all right now when I
[1:19:16] go to a church another church like say
[1:19:19] brother Joe Green he's got uh always the
[1:19:22] first week in August he's had camp
[1:19:25] meeting 50
[1:19:26] years and it's always the
[1:19:29] first there there's and and every person
[1:19:32] in his church is
[1:19:33] there cuz they know that's a special
[1:19:36] meeting they know it's there to let our
[1:19:40] light shine or their light shine and we
[1:19:43] we're recipients of that because a lot
[1:19:45] of us have went some of you have not and
[1:19:47] that's okay like I said I'm not here to
[1:19:49] beat anybody now I just want us to be
[1:19:50] aware that as long as we have special
[1:19:53] meetings I would like for y'all to be
[1:19:56] here okay two weeks ago we had a f we
[1:20:00] had a meeting with the youth all right I
[1:20:03] announced it two months in advance that
[1:20:05] we were going to have extra people here
[1:20:07] and we
[1:20:09] did a bunch of y'all decided not to show
[1:20:12] up
[1:20:15] Saturday my wife hobbling on one leg did
[1:20:19] about 90% of the work and my poor old
[1:20:21] 80y old mama did the other part and
[1:20:23] sister Esther helped some I don't mean
[1:20:26] that bad I just mean they came in
[1:20:29] later knowing we had a special
[1:20:37] meeting knowing we had and I was telling
[1:20:39] you weeks in advance we were going to
[1:20:43] have more people at that than we'd ever
[1:20:45] had in any kind of Youth service and
[1:20:47] that we needed some
[1:20:49] help and a bunch of y'all decided to go
[1:20:51] somewhere else
[1:20:54] I don't like that you shouldn't have
[1:20:57] done that and not just my wife and my
[1:20:58] poor
[1:20:59] Mama but that was a disservice to the
[1:21:02] people that he because you know what
[1:21:03] happened some of the visitors
[1:21:08] helped Saturday some of the visitors
[1:21:10] helped serve the
[1:21:12] people that doesn't show
[1:21:16] good so if you're not going to back if
[1:21:19] you're not going to back this church up
[1:21:21] all right the you need to tell
[1:21:23] somebody I don't want to do that on
[1:21:25] Saturday I'm not going to be here
[1:21:27] ever and then we can decide I'll hire
[1:21:30] somebody to help
[1:21:33] us but shame on
[1:21:35] you for saying you're part of this
[1:21:38] church and then you just run off and
[1:21:40] disappear and it didn't just happen two
[1:21:42] weeks ago we've had special meetings
[1:21:44] before and people decide to go somewhere
[1:21:46] else
[1:21:48] now like I said before I I'm not mad at
[1:21:51] anybody I'm just upset
[1:21:54] that we don't think
[1:21:55] enough of what we're doing in this
[1:21:57] church to be a part of
[1:22:02] it okay and as I said before if you have
[1:22:07] a named position in this church as long
[1:22:10] as I'm standing right here you have if
[1:22:12] you have a named position in this church
[1:22:14] you need to be at every special meeting
[1:22:16] you need to be at every church service
[1:22:18] that you can I know there certain times
[1:22:21] I'm talking about just BL ly not being
[1:22:25] here Bible
[1:22:28] study if you don't want that position
[1:22:31] you need to let me know or brother Dale
[1:22:33] know or brother Terence know that you
[1:22:35] don't want that position anymore if
[1:22:36] you're not going to hold that position
[1:22:39] to an honorable place so that people
[1:22:42] look and say well
[1:22:44] where's where's I don't know they're off
[1:22:48] you know at a basketball game or
[1:22:51] something
[1:22:55] okay position if you don't want it just
[1:22:59] tell somebody I I don't want to do that
[1:23:02] I I in other words I can't be here every
[1:23:05] first Saturday of every month for Bible
[1:23:06] study I'll find somebody take you place
[1:23:08] that
[1:23:09] will and like I said it's not it's not
[1:23:13] something that I you know but it is it's
[1:23:15] it's the way I feel I feel this and if
[1:23:18] you don't like it you can come to me and
[1:23:19] tell me but this is the way I feel that
[1:23:23] this church should be the most important
[1:23:25] thing at the time that we have meetings
[1:23:27] and at the time that them doors are open
[1:23:29] do you mind if I tell you what brother
[1:23:31] Brown said about opening the doors of a
[1:23:34] church listen I know vacation
[1:23:38] folks vacation is only once or twice a
[1:23:42] year I'm talking about all the
[1:23:45] time you go on vacation yeah vacation
[1:23:48] what you get about two three weeks I
[1:23:50] know some of y'all are retired but you
[1:23:51] know what
[1:23:53] I do the same thing now when I go to
[1:23:55] Illinois you know what I do I go during
[1:23:56] the week so that I don't miss a
[1:24:02] weekend I go during the week I take my
[1:24:04] own time
[1:24:06] off I ain't beating nobody's drunk
[1:24:08] brother Dale same way we go somewhere
[1:24:10] and he say find us a church we're going
[1:24:13] to church even on a Wednesday night find
[1:24:15] us a church I we'd find one somewhere or
[1:24:17] we'd go somewhere we' drive two hours to
[1:24:19] go to church when went to Kansas all
[1:24:21] right Richard was with or
[1:24:23] some it's your desire though and you
[1:24:26] know what I believe God blesses that
[1:24:28] desire but I believe also you come over
[1:24:31] into this
[1:24:33] group when you dishonor
[1:24:36] God I don't want to be in this group I
[1:24:39] don't be like the
[1:24:41] normal I want to be like
[1:24:45] God God's going to show up whether you
[1:24:47] do or not but he you know what he's
[1:24:49] going to do though he's going to show up
[1:24:50] in
[1:24:51] somebody
[1:24:54] that's how he's going to get here sure
[1:24:55] he likes to be here but listen God is
[1:24:58] not effective not in
[1:25:00] people you think about
[1:25:03] that God's always tied to somebody
[1:25:05] you're praying for somebody and God
[1:25:07] comes on the scene you're praying for
[1:25:09] somebody and God comes on the scene
[1:25:11] you're studying for a sermon and God
[1:25:13] comes on the scene and says hey say this
[1:25:16] I'm going to read something this
[1:25:16] afternoon where brother Rand on spoken
[1:25:18] words Original Seed the Holy Spirit told
[1:25:20] him to pick up his pen and write do you
[1:25:22] know what he wrote probably half the
[1:25:25] people even in this message don't
[1:25:27] believe
[1:25:28] it and it was written by the Holy Ghost
[1:25:30] he said the Holy Ghost pick said pick
[1:25:32] the pen up are we following the false
[1:25:36] prophet are we following false teaching
[1:25:39] here I hope not please say something if
[1:25:42] we
[1:25:44] are but we ought to show
[1:25:46] it by supporting and backing up
[1:25:49] everything that goes on in this
[1:25:51] church
[1:25:53] because I'm telling you like I said
[1:25:54] before all the special meetings I've
[1:25:56] ever been to everybody in the
[1:25:58] congregation that I know are there
[1:26:01] because they know it's a special meeting
[1:26:03] and they know that people need help and
[1:26:05] we like to serve the people I like to be
[1:26:07] a
[1:26:08] servant I actually did Saturday I served
[1:26:11] the people did I not we took out trash
[1:26:14] and all the different things we did do
[1:26:15] and that's okay you know what I don't
[1:26:17] mind it I'm not somebody brother Dale's
[1:26:19] never been that way and I appreciate
[1:26:21] that he's never been somebody that sits
[1:26:24] back over here on his big old throne
[1:26:26] with his wife and said bless God y'all
[1:26:29] I'm the pastor y'all do all the work no
[1:26:30] he jumps in before y'all do that's a
[1:26:33] servant's
[1:26:34] heart and you know what that's an
[1:26:36] example that I try to live by so we need
[1:26:40] to what practice what we
[1:26:42] preach okay so just just be mindful like
[1:26:45] I said before I'm not I'm not sing I'm
[1:26:47] not singling any one person out I'm just
[1:26:49] throwing it out look that's the way I
[1:26:51] want us to be from now now
[1:26:53] on if you're not going to be here for a
[1:26:55] special meeting you need to tell look
[1:26:57] I'm not going to be here all right I I
[1:27:00] don't believe in them I know some of
[1:27:01] y'all don't that's why you weren't here
[1:27:05] Saturday but that's a youth service
[1:27:08] whether you got youth or not I didn't
[1:27:10] have any youth here and I was
[1:27:13] here cuz I wanted to hear from
[1:27:15] God and you know what I wanted to do I
[1:27:18] wanted to see our youth do something for
[1:27:23] God I'd rather listen I'd rather see the
[1:27:26] youth do something for God than
[1:27:27] you cuz we're older we should be
[1:27:30] established we're Christians but maybe
[1:27:32] they're struggling maybe they're having
[1:27:34] a hard time maybe they're in that
[1:27:35] transition period of
[1:27:37] teenagers where they need more support
[1:27:40] than ever
[1:27:41] before and then you got you got the
[1:27:43] group like Jonas and different ones that
[1:27:45] are and and Thomas that are heading
[1:27:47] toward that uh teen
[1:27:50] years it's right rough and like I said
[1:27:54] before look what the world has given
[1:27:56] them that's right I just read you that
[1:27:58] whse forehead is out there in the school
[1:28:01] in the
[1:28:02] churches in families we're trying to get
[1:28:05] them out of that and put them over here
[1:28:08] where they can look and say oh that
[1:28:11] church supports youth we're going to go
[1:28:14] there just say let's stand to our
[1:28:17] feet I learn I learned this from Brother
[1:28:19] Dale he used to do this before the
[1:28:21] service started it you could tell
[1:28:22] everybody's head was cut off and they
[1:28:24] didn't even listen to what he said so I
[1:28:26] thought well today I'll do it afterwards
[1:28:29] and then you can chew on it at lunch you
[1:28:32] can throw you can throw your maters and
[1:28:34] ters at me if you want to and that's
[1:28:35] fine cuz that's what I'm having for
[1:28:36] lunch is tomatoes and I mean maters and
[1:28:39] and U carrots so been trying to lose a
[1:28:42] little weight but listen it's it's
[1:28:44] pencil sharpening time for all of us we
[1:28:47] need to step our game up because you
[1:28:49] know what God wants us that's what that
[1:28:50] is that's stepping up our game game
[1:28:52] that's not just being a numb
[1:28:55] Christian oh it's okay whatever no it's
[1:28:59] a
[1:28:59] fight it's a fight and we'll look at it
[1:29:02] this afternoon in Matthew 13 way I'd
[1:29:04] never seen that before about the seed
[1:29:06] and where it fell into because remember
[1:29:09] you look at some of those scenarios and
[1:29:12] it looks like he's talking about people
[1:29:13] of the world no the Bible says that that
[1:29:17] group of people is the children of the
[1:29:19] Kingdom that's me and you and there
[1:29:22] things that happen in our life that we
[1:29:24] need to get rid of Amen let's bow our
[1:29:26] heads dear heavenly father if there's
[1:29:28] anyone that needs to be prayed for or
[1:29:31] has a need father I pray that you'd just
[1:29:33] touch them where they're
[1:29:35] sitting we pray father that what we said
[1:29:37] have been pleasing to you Lord we been
[1:29:41] uh running it over in our head and
[1:29:43] trying to get your thoughts not mine to
[1:29:46] help each one of us not to hurt anyone
[1:29:49] Lord I pray that you would be with us as
[1:29:52] a
[1:29:53] church I feel that we're trying to do
[1:29:55] the best we can at the time Lord I pray
[1:29:59] that you'd be with each person that has
[1:30:01] a position we're going to talk a little
[1:30:03] bit that tonight when we come to
[1:30:05] Godliness and brotherly kindness we need
[1:30:06] to know who we are we need to know our
[1:30:09] position and as we were talking about
[1:30:11] last
[1:30:12] night brother Brown said when the bride
[1:30:15] realizes who she is and also her
[1:30:18] position what's going to happen she'll
[1:30:20] be an invincible Army
[1:30:22] because we know we'll know who we are
[1:30:25] and we're only going to know who we are
[1:30:26] by the foolishness of preaching you
[1:30:29] we're going to have to all hear the word
[1:30:30] we got to all come up to the Statue of
[1:30:32] perfect man we've got to all come to the
[1:30:34] unity of the faith we've got to all come
[1:30:36] to this full stature of Christ so that
[1:30:38] the headstone can come back on the
[1:30:40] church and then we will be a Powerhouse
[1:30:43] just for a moment thank God you sent us
[1:30:46] a prophet to tell us just for a moment
[1:30:48] even in the darkest time just for a
[1:30:50] moment God's going to speak through his
[1:30:51] church one more time and then we're
[1:30:53] going to be taken off the Earth and then
[1:30:55] the wrath of God will be poured out on
[1:30:57] this whole entire Earth but praise God
[1:30:59] we'll be gone we'll be gone in the
[1:31:02] twinkling of an eye we'll be in another
[1:31:03] dimension and and nuclear power is not
[1:31:06] going to hurt us there nothing's going
[1:31:07] to hurt us no harm we'll have no
[1:31:09] sickness no
[1:31:11] disease we'll be
[1:31:13] Eternal Father I pray that you give us a
[1:31:16] piece of that while we're here let us
[1:31:19] see that you're working in each of our
[1:31:21] life Lord Lord and the things we do
[1:31:23] father forgive us of our sins and our
[1:31:25] mistakes that we make Lord just be with
[1:31:26] us as we go with a natural meal and come
[1:31:28] back today this afternoon Lord I pray
[1:31:30] that you be with the ones that are
[1:31:31] watching in the ones that are sick that
[1:31:33] you'll bless them Lord and bring them
[1:31:35] back to church service father we ask
[1:31:37] these things in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:40] amen your dismiss God bless
