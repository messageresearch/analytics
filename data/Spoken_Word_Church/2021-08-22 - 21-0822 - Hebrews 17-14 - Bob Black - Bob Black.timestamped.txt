[0:00] eat it
[0:04] and we'll just go into the a little a
[0:06] little sunday school lesson for for the
[0:08] next 30 minutes
[0:10] before the song service
[0:12] and uh as you as you know we've been
[0:14] going through if the builders could pull
[0:15] up their little powerpoint slide
[0:17] uh the book of hebrews
[0:19] and i think we've made it to about verse
[0:20] seven
[0:23] and uh
[0:25] and and hebrews is really trying to uh
[0:28] that paul trying to really set the stage
[0:30] of trying to set within the people's
[0:32] minds that the of who they believed and
[0:34] that this is this this this man jesus
[0:37] christ that's come on the scene and and
[0:38] and began to speak the
[0:40] the message that we have heard that they
[0:42] heard back then in the early church
[0:45] is more than just a man uh
[0:47] as the the apostles and the prophets or
[0:49] the the the people spoke down to the
[0:52] ages they kind of gave a little
[0:53] reflection a little bit of the light but
[0:56] now this man came on the scene and they
[0:57] could see clearly um
[1:00] who it was that that that we believe
[1:03] so let's just kind of review um hebrews
[1:06] 1 1-6 it says god who has sundry times
[1:09] and in diverse manners spake in times
[1:11] past unto the fathers by the prophet so
[1:13] at many times many different ways
[1:16] somebody was actually speaking through
[1:18] to them through the to the fathers by
[1:20] the prophets and it was this it was this
[1:22] one
[1:23] jesus christ who had now and verse two
[1:25] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:27] by a son now was actually had ministered
[1:30] to them in the flesh and they were able
[1:32] to to hear him and and sit on the shores
[1:34] of galilee and listen to him speaking to
[1:36] them and and as thomas did put his
[1:38] fingers in his side and they could
[1:40] actually hug this man and and and talk
[1:42] to him and listen to him hath in these
[1:44] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[1:46] he hath appointed the heir of all things
[1:49] and we know appointed because he had an
[1:50] appointment to actually come and die for
[1:52] us on the cross and to fulfill the word
[1:54] of god that he was appointed to do and
[1:56] he was appointed heir of all things in
[1:58] other words he was appointed he he being
[2:01] god himself he was heir of everything
[2:04] by whom also he made the worlds so this
[2:07] man that walked on the shores of galilee
[2:09] is actually the one that spoke the
[2:10] worlds into existence that spoke
[2:12] everything into existence
[2:14] who being the brightness of his glory
[2:16] and the express image of his person in
[2:18] other words like jesus said if you if
[2:20] you've seen me you've seen the father if
[2:22] you've seen me you know everything there
[2:24] is to know about the father you you i i
[2:26] am the brightness of his glory and the
[2:28] express the express image of who the
[2:30] father is and upholding all things by
[2:33] the world
[2:35] all things by the world of his power
[2:37] when he had by himself purged our sins
[2:40] set down on the right hand of the
[2:41] majesty on high
[2:43] and and that that verse rather sat down
[2:45] on the right hand of the majesty on high
[2:47] that's got a lot of things kind of
[2:49] packed into that that maybe we'll get to
[2:51] time permitting sat down on the right
[2:54] hand of the majesty on high there's so
[2:56] many every it's like everything that
[2:58] paul says is just so packed full of
[3:01] richness richness and so that's
[3:03] what we want to do as we go through this
[3:05] the the book of hebrews is just kind of
[3:07] unpack some of these things that paul is
[3:09] talking about
[3:11] being made so much better than the
[3:13] angels in other words being made so much
[3:15] better than the ones that were speaking
[3:17] down to the old testament the ones that
[3:19] you know so much better than than
[3:21] gabriel that the little bit of light
[3:23] that they could shed as they were going
[3:26] as they were speaking down to the old
[3:27] testament gabriel would come to daniel
[3:30] and shed a little bit of light and and
[3:32] uh and and david and all the prophets
[3:34] would speak and a little bit of
[3:36] light but now here was the one
[3:38] that was that they were speaking of made
[3:40] manifest before them as he has by
[3:43] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[3:47] name than they
[3:48] and the name that he inherited that the
[3:50] name was jesus christ that he came he
[3:53] came in the name of the father
[3:56] for unto which of the angels said he at
[3:58] any time thou art my son of this day
[4:00] have i begotten thee this day have i
[4:02] have have i birthed you and again i will
[4:05] be to him a father and he shall be to me
[4:08] a son which to which of them had did he
[4:10] to the angels to the prophets which of
[4:12] them did he say that and again when he
[4:15] bringeth in the first begotten in the
[4:16] world he saith
[4:19] and let all the angels of god
[4:22] worship him so let's go to the next
[4:24] slide in hebrews 1-7 it begins to talk
[4:27] about angels so we'll just kind of sit
[4:29] on this a little bit and and start to
[4:30] unpack that talking about the angels
[4:33] what did brother what did brother paul
[4:35] really mean when he was beginning to
[4:37] talk about the angels and how this man
[4:39] was more excellent than the angels
[4:42] he said
[4:43] of the angels he saith
[4:45] who make his angels spirits i want you
[4:47] to notice how much is packed into their
[4:49] scripture spirits his angels now now we
[4:52] know i got these little cards
[4:53] highlighted here
[4:54] let me not step away too far from the
[4:56] mic
[4:57] angels the definition in the in the
[4:59] greek of an angel is a messenger
[5:01] so angels are messengers
[5:03] and a minister a minister is somebody
[5:05] that ministers to people and of the
[5:08] angels he saith who maketh his angels
[5:10] spirits so the angels there's something
[5:13] spiritual going on something
[5:14] supernatural and his ministers a flame
[5:17] of fire
[5:18] a minister a flame of fire
[5:21] so much so much goodness here to unpack
[5:24] so let's go through it
[5:26] and see what um the prophet that we
[5:28] believe that came in this last day had
[5:30] to say about these things
[5:31] now go to the next slide and in hebrews
[5:34] 1 7 and brother branham said in the
[5:36] message and that he preached in 1951 in
[5:38] the ain't called the angel of the lord
[5:40] he said
[5:41] the whole book of revelation was showed
[5:43] john by an angel
[5:45] i jesus has sent my angel to testify
[5:48] he's quoting scripture is that right
[5:50] so angels are ministering spirits you
[5:52] usually come in the form of lights and i
[5:55] truly personally as i started to say a
[5:56] while ago with my bible over my heart
[5:59] i believe that the angel of god i've
[6:01] seen it since i was a little boy
[6:03] and that little cabin they told me he
[6:05] come in that you see in the picture that
[6:06] the lady
[6:08] drawed last night of a little cabin
[6:09] where i was born that that doesn't make
[6:11] me even equal with the church
[6:14] or the people
[6:16] that's right in other words he was
[6:17] saying i'm not sharing this to make
[6:18] myself a big person or somebody that you
[6:21] would highly regard in that way
[6:23] he said it isn't the idea today who's
[6:25] great and who's not great
[6:27] the idea of it today
[6:29] is to get people to believe the lord
[6:31] jesus
[6:32] so in other words we believe we believe
[6:34] in the supernatural there's a
[6:35] supernatural element there's a
[6:37] supernatural unseen world that that we
[6:40] can't see with our natural eyes and in
[6:42] that world are these supernatural beings
[6:44] angels that are moving around that
[6:46] sometimes you know people will get a
[6:48] glimpse of something supernatural with a
[6:50] light and you've heard people testify in
[6:52] some church meetings where they'll look
[6:53] over and they'll see an angel standing
[6:54] there as the preaching of the gospel is
[6:56] going on so i really want to stress to
[6:58] you that it's not a strange thing for us
[7:00] to believe a prophet that saw an angel
[7:02] because paul said the very first church
[7:04] age messenger
[7:05] that he's that an angel came and told
[7:07] him to not to fear with the ship was
[7:09] wrecked when he was on his journey and
[7:11] an angel actually came an angel came and
[7:14] loosed him out of the jail so we believe
[7:16] in a supernatural element we we're we're
[7:18] it's not far-fetched to believe that
[7:20] there are angels there are angels the
[7:22] bible says that angels will visit you
[7:24] unaware and they might look like just a
[7:26] normal human being one of my favorite
[7:27] stories is
[7:29] where brother branham was he was going
[7:31] into his home
[7:32] and he said there was a man with a
[7:33] little flat nose outside and he and he
[7:35] told him uh you know he gave him a
[7:37] little a little warning about you know
[7:39] watch out for such and such i don't
[7:40] remember the specifics and all of a
[7:42] sudden he disappeared
[7:44] and it was a uh you know you take that
[7:46] it was something supernatural happened
[7:48] it was a supernatural visitation so we
[7:50] believe we believe in angels but now to
[7:53] get really get the sense of what paul's
[7:54] talking about here
[7:56] he's kind of he's kind of bringing the
[7:58] supernatural down to where you can
[8:00] actually you're actually sitting in a
[8:02] church service and you're actually
[8:03] listening to a messenger you're actually
[8:05] listening to somebody bring you the word
[8:07] and so he's actually bringing you he's
[8:09] actually trying to to bring to your
[8:11] knowledge and understanding that the
[8:13] angels that you might be thinking of
[8:14] might not be the angels that he's
[8:16] talking about
[8:17] and he said so let's go to the next
[8:19] slide and of the angels we're talking
[8:21] about this this scripture uh hebrews 1 7
[8:24] of the angels he saith who makes his
[8:26] angels spirits and his minister is a
[8:27] flame of fire
[8:29] now brother brown said in the message
[8:30] faith in 1956 he said now what happened
[8:32] just now so he's talking about again
[8:35] another world
[8:36] it's an unseen world there's an unseen
[8:38] world beyond the veil of our flesh that
[8:40] we can't perceive by our natural eye
[8:43] we become so conscious of looking at one
[8:45] another like this
[8:46] but there's an unseen world and you it's
[8:49] greater than anything you can see now
[8:52] think about that that even as you're
[8:53] sitting here
[8:54] you know waiting we're about to enter
[8:56] into the song service i'm about to hear
[8:58] the preaching of the word that there's
[8:59] actually an unseen world that angels
[9:01] could be walking even even your loved
[9:03] ones could be appearing over the
[9:05] banister of heaven listening to the word
[9:07] that you're hearing right now
[9:08] and all of these things cannot be
[9:10] perceived by your natural eye but yet
[9:12] it's there because there's an unseen
[9:14] world that you can't perceive
[9:16] he said there's an unseen world and it's
[9:18] greater than anything you can see in
[9:19] this world in this building here are
[9:22] evil spirits and war
[9:24] and christians anointed and the angels
[9:26] of god encamped about them trying to
[9:29] energize them with faith
[9:32] now isn't that just a powerful scripture
[9:34] to think
[9:35] to think that the angels of god are
[9:37] encamped around about you and they want
[9:40] you to believe they're here trying to
[9:42] help you now let's keep going on let's
[9:44] go to the next slide and and brother
[9:45] brown said in the greatest battle ever
[9:47] fought he said
[9:48] now here the bible comes right back and
[9:50] tells us here that god sends forth
[9:52] angels
[9:53] what are they
[9:55] ministering spirits the glory now see
[9:57] now now the kind of picture he's
[9:59] bringing it down
[10:00] to earthly where you're sitting at a in
[10:03] a
[10:04] service
[10:05] and you're hearing a messenger
[10:07] preach you the word that's been anointed
[10:10] by a spirit from another world that's
[10:13] been anointed by the holy spirit to
[10:15] bring you a message that will help you
[10:17] out of the predicament that you're in
[10:20] that sends forth angels glory what are
[10:23] they ministering spirits glory
[10:25] ministering spirit sent from the
[10:26] presence of god
[10:28] what what to do minister his word
[10:31] they're not to minister some theology of
[10:34] some denominational group but to
[10:36] minister his word that's it ministering
[10:39] spirit set forth how do we know they are
[10:42] the bible said that the word of the lord
[10:44] came to the prophets is that right
[10:48] these angels minister his word
[10:51] through his spirit minister the word
[10:54] through the holy spirit and the spirit
[10:56] and the word came to the prophets and
[10:59] the prophets had the word of god
[11:01] so now we're bringing it down to the
[11:03] earthly where you can actually sit in
[11:05] church and listen to an angel bring you
[11:08] the word an angel that's anointed by
[11:11] something from another world by
[11:13] something supernatural to give an action
[11:15] so that they can speak the word to help
[11:18] you
[11:19] now let's go to the next slide he said
[11:20] in hebrews now this is where we really
[11:23] nail it down where brother brown was
[11:24] preaching the series on hebrews and we
[11:27] got to chapter 2
[11:28] he began to really nail down what these
[11:31] angels are that paul was talking about
[11:34] and he said what do we find the angels
[11:36] to be
[11:37] prophets
[11:38] god spoke in sundry time now you have to
[11:41] make not our own idea our own idea might
[11:45] be that we need to hear we need to we
[11:47] need to put all our confidence only in
[11:49] seeing a light or having some
[11:51] supernatural thing come but our
[11:53] confidence is on the word of god
[11:55] not a feeling or a sensation or
[11:57] something that we've that we've you know
[11:59] maybe some supernatural a dream that we
[12:01] had or something like dreams are nice
[12:03] and their dreams are wonderful and we
[12:05] need dreams but
[12:06] so many times you can't put confidence
[12:09] on a dream but you can put confidence on
[12:12] the word of god
[12:13] what do we find the angels to be
[12:15] prophets now you have to make not your
[12:17] own idea our own idea but the bible now
[12:19] the first chapter the first verse god
[12:21] who at sundry times in diver's manner
[12:24] spake to the fathers by the prophets
[12:26] now he goes over here and say again for
[12:28] the words spoken by angels were
[12:30] steadfast
[12:32] and what does an angel mean a messenger
[12:35] if god anointed messenger and then if we
[12:38] be anointed
[12:40] if we be anointed by the supernatural
[12:42] element by the holy spirit
[12:44] we are gods and messengers all right
[12:47] now let's tie it all together let's go
[12:49] to the next slide so let's tie some of
[12:50] these scriptures together it says in
[12:52] hebrews 1 7 and of the angels he saith
[12:55] who maketh his angels spirits and his
[12:57] ministers of flame of fire
[12:59] and now in the the last of of this first
[13:02] chapter and in verses 13 14 it says but
[13:06] to which of the angels said he at any
[13:08] time sit on my right hand until i make
[13:10] thine enemies thy footstool
[13:12] are they not all ministering spirits
[13:15] and sent forth to minister
[13:18] for them who shall be heirs of salvation
[13:20] so so again now he's ministering spirits
[13:23] he's talking about
[13:25] ministers behind the pulpit
[13:27] and then he says hebrews chapter two
[13:29] verse five to six now now this is what
[13:31] brother brown is really talking about he
[13:34] says it says for unto the angels hath he
[13:36] not put in subjection the world to come
[13:38] wherever we speak but one in a certain
[13:40] place testified
[13:41] one in a certain place testified now
[13:43] who's he quoting he's quoting david now
[13:46] he's saying an angel said and then he
[13:49] quotes david so if it was an angel like
[13:52] a supernatural angel with wings or light
[13:54] or whatever some kind of supernatural
[13:56] thing then he would not be able to quote
[13:58] a man that actually spoke these words
[14:01] the man david said what is man that thou
[14:05] art mindfully of him or the son of man
[14:07] that thou visitest him so then we kind
[14:09] of can clinch that in the ground that
[14:11] the angels that paul are speaking of
[14:13] are now these men that have been
[14:15] anointed by something supernatural
[14:18] now now you can actually go back and
[14:20] listen to hebrews chapter 2
[14:22] and and the message that brother branham
[14:23] priest where he really clinches that
[14:25] into the ground that we're talking about
[14:27] now men that can actually minister to
[14:29] you
[14:30] so and let's go to the next slide he
[14:32] said see in your body inside of you we
[14:34] got another question on that directly
[14:36] that that'll answer it better so when
[14:38] inside of you is a spirit another man
[14:40] the outside of you is one man the inside
[14:42] of you is another man so the inside of
[14:44] you is the supernatural
[14:46] the outside of you is the physical and
[14:48] this being
[14:49] if you are spirit led by god
[14:52] you became a messenger of god
[14:54] or an angel
[14:56] god's messenger
[14:58] god's angel is the very same word can't
[15:01] separate it god's messenger or god's
[15:03] angel
[15:04] and which has the greatest authority now
[15:07] this is this really clinches it
[15:09] which has the greatest authority an
[15:11] angel from heaven or an angel at the
[15:13] pulpit which has which has it the angel
[15:16] at the pulpit
[15:18] paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[15:20] and preaches any other gospel to you
[15:22] than this which i've already preached
[15:24] let him be accursed so the angel
[15:27] anointed with the holy spirit and with
[15:29] the word stands next to god
[15:32] in the heaven his authority
[15:34] now that's for something that's that's a
[15:35] really weighted quote to read that an
[15:38] angel in the pulpit in other words
[15:39] somebody that's got the holy ghost on
[15:41] the inside and knows the correct
[15:43] interpretation of the word and actually
[15:45] god is building up their faith here that
[15:47] they can actually stand in this element
[15:49] of time in flesh and speak the word out
[15:52] and deliver some money from their
[15:54] predicament actually is in a higher
[15:55] place than an angel and they have
[15:58] greater authority than it why because
[16:00] they're actually tied in by the new
[16:02] birth with god with eternal life and
[16:04] they're speaking from a place like that
[16:06] the scripture says a minister should
[16:08] speak as of the oracles of god because
[16:10] they're speaking as though they're
[16:12] reflecting the light from within that
[16:14] holy place they're speaking they're
[16:16] reflecting out the light of the holy of
[16:18] holies so that you can get a glimpse of
[16:20] the eternal things that god wants you to
[16:22] see
[16:23] now let's go to the next slide he said
[16:25] the greatest battle ever fall now if you
[16:27] go back and listen to the greatest
[16:29] battle ever fault brother brown really
[16:30] nails down how the benefit of ministers
[16:33] to the church and see that's exactly
[16:35] what paul is laying down here in the in
[16:37] in this church in in this chapter that
[16:39] ministers and the greatest battle ever
[16:41] fought what does brother ryan say that
[16:42] ministers will give you something to get
[16:44] you out of the eggshell they'll get you
[16:46] they'll give you a gift they'll give
[16:48] they'll arm you with the word to give
[16:50] get you out of depression and out of sin
[16:52] and out of that life of iniquity
[16:55] and things and brother abraham says in
[16:56] this message he said these are
[16:57] ministering spirits
[16:59] sent from the presence of god to be
[17:01] ministers to minister what his word not
[17:04] some theology but god's word
[17:07] they are ministering spirits sent forth
[17:09] from god to minister and remember if it
[17:12] ministers something besides the word it
[17:15] didn't come from god
[17:17] because thy word is always confirmed in
[17:19] heaven
[17:20] always in heaven the word god watches
[17:23] over it and he'll never send a spirit to
[17:26] minister something besides the word
[17:30] now let's go to the next slide and he
[17:31] said
[17:32] now now he begins to talk about micah
[17:34] and micah is one of those stories in the
[17:36] bible if you just kind of reset set your
[17:38] remembrance those three kings went to go
[17:39] fight a battle and they had 400 prophets
[17:42] and jehoshaphat said well let's let's we
[17:44] wanted to find a real prophet so they
[17:46] went out searching for a real prophet
[17:48] micah came on the scene and brother
[17:50] brown uses him as an example of what a
[17:52] ministering spirit was because he didn't
[17:54] listen to all the stuff that the 400
[17:57] prophet said he was going to stay
[17:59] straight with god's word why because he
[18:01] was anointed he was anointed with a
[18:04] supernatural spirit
[18:06] something that allowed him to see
[18:08] into another into that other realm and
[18:11] he had a supernatural understanding of
[18:13] what was actually going to take place
[18:16] so that made him a ministering spirit
[18:18] that he was able to deliver a message
[18:20] that was beyond anything that you could
[18:22] understand with the flesh and was far
[18:25] beyond anything that those 400 prophets
[18:27] those 400 lying unbelieving prophets
[18:30] were able to to bring
[18:32] now so brother brahma said in the
[18:34] message the greatest battle ever fought
[18:35] he said why his flues had been cleaned
[18:37] down and what are your flues your memory
[18:39] reason consciousness affects your
[18:40] imagination in other words he was
[18:42] discarding all of that stuff and just
[18:45] taking god's word he didn't care what he
[18:47] remembered or imagined or or thought up
[18:50] he was just going to take god's word and
[18:52] that was it
[18:53] he said his mind had opened up to the
[18:55] word of god
[18:56] and the word of god only would he
[18:58] believe that's a ministering spirit
[19:01] that's a ministering spirit that's what
[19:03] a ministering spirit is he said i don't
[19:06] know what to say now
[19:07] but i'll tell you this one thing
[19:09] i'll only say what god tells me to say
[19:13] now let's go to the next slide and
[19:14] brother brahm said how do we know they
[19:16] are the bible said the word of the lord
[19:18] came to the prophets
[19:19] these angels minister his word
[19:21] through his spirit talking about angels
[19:24] these angels minister his word
[19:26] through the holy spirit and the spirit
[19:28] and the word came to the prophets and
[19:30] the prophets had the word of god
[19:33] that's the reason they could do the
[19:34] miracles that they did
[19:36] it wasn't the man it was the spirit of
[19:39] god in the man
[19:41] the spirit of christ and the man for the
[19:43] word of god what had he done cleaned out
[19:46] every channel god had chose him and he
[19:48] was anointed with the holy ghost and
[19:51] that's the spirit the ministering spirit
[19:54] it's the holy ghost in the man
[19:56] to minister and to speak out to you and
[19:58] to help you get out of your predicament
[20:01] now now so you you you gotta like blend
[20:04] these supernatural the supernatural
[20:06] element and the earthly element where
[20:09] god can actually get in the earth let's
[20:10] go to the next slide and speak out
[20:12] through somebody and help you
[20:16] now so this is i've got a little picture
[20:18] of a of of the three men
[20:21] three men that came to abraham
[20:24] and so let's read what brother brown
[20:25] said about that so we got there we got a
[20:27] supernatural type
[20:29] typing something that actually happened
[20:31] in the flesh in this day
[20:33] now because brother brown said he said
[20:35] there was three angels came to abraham
[20:37] the church elected two of them went down
[20:39] in sodom and brought out lot and his
[20:42] wife and daughters she turned around
[20:44] sodomites burned
[20:46] so there's three supernatural men that
[20:48] came and spoke and we know who those men
[20:50] are but now in this day let's bring it
[20:52] down there were actually
[20:54] angels fleshly men that were speaking
[20:57] out to deliver a message and he and
[20:59] brother brown compares
[21:01] two of them he said two of them a modern
[21:03] billy graham and an oral robbers
[21:05] in this day
[21:07] his messages went down into sodom
[21:10] preaching the word blinding them with
[21:12] the word to disbelieve the word you are
[21:14] blind the preaching of the gospel blinds
[21:17] the unbeliever and that's what billy
[21:19] graham and those evangelists are doing
[21:21] blinding so i'm really nailing down this
[21:23] morning that the angels these ministers
[21:26] the oral roberts and billy graham were
[21:28] earthly ministers that were anointed to
[21:31] preach a message to deliver a message
[21:34] because that's what an angel is as a
[21:35] messenger
[21:37] and they've got a message and so they
[21:39] had a message but now there was a third
[21:41] one now
[21:42] the lord himself that actually came down
[21:44] and he had a message so maybe just just
[21:48] meditate on that for a little bit
[21:49] let's go to the next slide and and uh
[21:52] we'll be done in just a few more minutes
[21:54] and can go on into the song service and
[21:56] it says in hebrews chapter two brother
[21:58] i'm preaching again he said for the four
[22:00] if the word spoke by angels
[22:02] what do we find the angels to be
[22:05] prophets
[22:07] now now let's go go to the next slide
[22:09] i'm i'm running through some of these
[22:10] kind of quickly but i i i think i think
[22:13] you get the idea
[22:16] and brother brown said in discernment of
[22:17] spirit now now this is what confuses
[22:19] people when you get into what a new
[22:21] testament prophet is brother braham said
[22:23] a new testament prophet is a preacher
[22:26] a preacher we said we all know that just
[22:28] any minister that's a preacher
[22:30] is a prophet
[22:32] a new testament prophet if he's
[22:34] prophesying preaching not try to to try
[22:37] to edify himself to make a big name or
[22:40] to edify his organization and go down to
[22:42] the next the next verse he said now if
[22:44] we'll notice the motives and objectives
[22:46] of the old testament prophets
[22:49] them men had one objective and that was
[22:51] jesus christ they had one thing that
[22:55] their whole theme of the old testament
[22:56] was built around the coming messiah
[22:59] in other words their whole objective was
[23:01] jesus christ it was not to build up a
[23:03] big following not to amass a great big
[23:06] pile of money
[23:07] not not any of the things you know uh
[23:09] popularity anything like that their
[23:12] whole motive was jesus christ so let's
[23:15] let's examine that word prophet and and
[23:17] maybe we'll take that into
[23:19] some of this into the next week as well
[23:21] but the word prophet in the greek
[23:22] lexicon in greek writings an interpreter
[23:25] of oracles or of hidden things in other
[23:27] words they're speaking by supernatural
[23:30] anointing to interpret actually and to
[23:32] speak what the word says one who moved
[23:35] by the spirit of god and hence his organ
[23:38] or spokesman solemnly declares
[23:41] a spirit of god and hence his organ or
[23:43] spokesman solemnly declares the men what
[23:46] he has received by inspiration so a new
[23:49] testament prophet
[23:51] preacher
[23:52] is going to be speaking by inspiration
[23:55] and it will we'll get into the
[23:56] difference between what a new testament
[23:58] prophet is and what a prophet is in the
[24:01] five full ministry and what a prophet is
[24:04] that would be over the seven church ages
[24:06] the kind of prophet was that that
[24:09] all these different kind of things
[24:10] because i i think sometimes it kind of
[24:12] confuses people
[24:13] when you talk about a new testament
[24:15] prophet preacher
[24:17] you begin to wonder well are you saying
[24:19] that they've got the same kind of gift
[24:21] of discernment and all these kind of
[24:23] things that that that like brother
[24:25] branham did it it's it's kind of putting
[24:27] different labels on on things so that
[24:29] you can be the new testament prophet is
[24:31] someone that speaks under the
[24:33] inspiration of the holy spirit to preach
[24:36] the word under inspiration
[24:39] like like brother brown was saying in in
[24:41] the greatest battle ever fault to get
[24:43] you out of your predicament to help you
[24:45] to loose you from your sins to get to
[24:48] build up your faith to a place where you
[24:50] know that god has done something for you
[24:52] that he cares about you to to bring up
[24:55] in your mind the question of whether or
[24:56] not you care or not and why that's
[24:59] important and he said so in 2e down
[25:02] there at the bottom he said a men filled
[25:04] with the spirit of god and the musicians
[25:05] can start going coming forward and we'll
[25:07] start transitioning to the next part of
[25:09] the service of men filled with the
[25:11] spirit of god who by god's authority and
[25:14] command and words of weight
[25:16] pleads the cause of god
[25:18] and urges salvation of men
[25:21] and that's a new testament prophet and
[25:23] that's why we're talking about in in in
[25:25] hebrews chapter 1 verse 7 and of the
[25:27] angels he saith
[25:29] who maketh his angels spirits
[25:31] and his ministers a flame of fire
[25:35] and maybe just take that and meditate on
[25:37] it through the through the week and uh
[25:39] and god bless you thanks
