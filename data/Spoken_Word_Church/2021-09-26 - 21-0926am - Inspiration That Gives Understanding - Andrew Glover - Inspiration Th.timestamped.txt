[12:35] see him uh still on the firing line amen
[12:37] we appreciate the invitation to come the
[12:39] opportunity to minister to you today
[12:42] let's look here in the book of job
[12:44] the 32nd chapter
[12:46] in the eighth verse
[12:48] uh the bible here says but there is a
[12:50] spirit
[12:51] in man
[12:52] and the inspiration of the almighty
[12:56] giveth them understanding
[12:58] great men are not always wise
[13:01] and neither
[13:02] do the aged understand judgment now job
[13:06] here is using a very powerful word it's
[13:09] the word of understanding but watch here
[13:11] he says there's a spirit in man
[13:14] and it's the inspiration so it's the
[13:16] inspiration of the almighty which is our
[13:18] god that giveth them understanding
[13:21] great men are not always wise and
[13:24] neither do the age understand judgment
[13:26] now if we could look here in the book of
[13:28] first john the fifth chapter
[13:30] i want to pick up this word here again
[13:32] in first john uh the fifth chapter
[13:35] and in the the 18th verse
[13:38] first john 5
[13:40] and verse number 18.
[13:43] you love the lord this morning
[13:45] amen the book of john first john the
[13:47] fifth chapter
[13:48] the 18th verse
[13:50] john here writing says now
[13:52] we know that whosoever is born of god
[13:56] senteth not
[13:57] but he that is begotten of god
[14:00] keepeth himself and that wicked one
[14:02] toucheth him not i love i love how
[14:05] john's writing here he's writing to the
[14:07] believer's knowledge and he says and we
[14:09] know
[14:10] that we are of god and the whole world
[14:13] lieth in wickedness john's not
[14:15] questioning this he's standing there
[14:16] with an authority we know that we are of
[14:19] god in verse 20 and we know that the son
[14:22] of god is come and hath given that word
[14:24] given means delivered something or to be
[14:27] administered hath given amen us an
[14:30] understanding that we may know him that
[14:33] is true and that we are in him that is
[14:35] true even in his son jesus christ this
[14:40] is the true god
[14:41] and eternal life and john closes by
[14:44] saying little children
[14:46] keep yourselves from idols amen we ask
[14:50] the lord this morning to add the
[14:51] blessing to the reading of his word as
[14:52] we just borrow our hearts together here
[14:54] this morning how many would just have a
[14:56] special need upon your heart you would
[14:58] just say lord come and speak to me this
[15:00] morning amen heavenly father lord as
[15:03] your believers have gathered here today
[15:05] on this beautiful sunday morning this
[15:07] beautiful resurrection sunday that
[15:09] you've given us father lord when the sun
[15:11] is shining on the outside
[15:13] father we are so privileged to be
[15:15] walking under the prophet's message lord
[15:18] to be walking under a message it is the
[15:20] rising of the sun
[15:22] and lord to hear your prophet say in
[15:23] this hour there's been a dual sun rising
[15:26] the s-u-n has risen but the s-o-n has
[15:29] risen in our hearts to bring that
[15:31] promised life to that promised seed and
[15:33] this morning lord as we gather here
[15:35] today you know the needs of your
[15:37] children lord whether they be great or
[15:39] small whether they be financial material
[15:42] lord spiritual physical lord whatever
[15:45] the need would be father we are
[15:47] confident this morning that there is no
[15:49] need to great there is no situation too
[15:52] big but what you can move up on the face
[15:54] of the circumstances and i pray this
[15:56] morning lord as we have sung the songs
[15:58] of zion as the liberty of the holy ghost
[16:00] just come into the meeting now father
[16:02] may you anoint both speaker and hear
[16:04] lord may you take these thoughts that
[16:06] you've laid upon my heart may you help
[16:08] me to get myself out of the way lord
[16:10] that you could come and minister to your
[16:12] children father and may you not only
[16:14] anoint me to speak but may you anoint
[16:16] the children to pull and to receive from

[16:20] accomplished here today we'll be sure to
[16:23] give thee all the praise all the honor
[16:25] and all the glory for it's in the
[16:27] wonderful name of our lord and savior
[16:29] jesus christ we pray and all the
[16:31] believer says
[16:33] amen and amen and may god bless you this
[16:36] morning amen as you may have your seats
[16:38] here amen you love the lord today amen i
[16:41] believe we've just got uh one one
[16:43] meeting here with you this morning so
[16:45] maybe we could just take a few moments
[16:46] here in the word and if i would title
[16:49] this this morning i want to speak to you
[16:50] for a few moments here on inspiration
[16:53] that gives understanding
[16:55] inspiration that gives understanding and
[16:58] i i have just been uh here for a little
[17:00] bit in a bit of a series or study on the
[17:02] benefits of god amen how many believes
[17:05] that god has given us benefits amen when
[17:07] you when you read the book of psalms the
[17:09] 68th chapter the 19th verse david will
[17:11] actually say he says blessed be the lord
[17:14] who daily loadeth us with benefits
[17:17] even the god of our salvation now we
[17:20] realize that these benefits are not
[17:22] coming just once a year or once a month
[17:24] or in a camp meeting amen but david says
[17:27] the benefits of god are continuous
[17:29] they're daily that god will daily load
[17:32] us with benefits now another word for
[17:35] benefit is privilege and that word
[17:37] privilege actually means a special right
[17:39] it means an advantage an immunity
[17:42] something that's been granted or is
[17:43] available only to a particular person or
[17:46] group it is an advantage it is a right
[17:49] it is a benefit entitlement birthright
[17:52] do freedom and liberty so amen
[17:55] privileges are not just given to
[17:57] everybody but they're only given to a
[17:59] particular person or a particular group
[18:01] now the prophet of god will say this
[18:03] this is a great hour and i'm so glad to
[18:06] be living here he said you know moses
[18:08] would have loved to have lived in this
[18:10] time all the apostles amen would have
[18:12] liked to have been living in this time
[18:15] he says and here we are living in this
[18:17] time and we are living under our
[18:20] privileges think about that here we are
[18:22] amen living in this time when the
[18:24] apostles were looking forward to this
[18:26] time he meant when moses was looking
[18:29] forward to this time and the prophet
[18:31] says here we are living in this time he
[18:34] says and we are living under our
[18:36] privileges how that god amen wants to
[18:38] bless his people amen think about that
[18:41] amen that it is not a burden to god to
[18:44] bless you amen but it is actually the
[18:46] desire of god to bless his people
[18:48] brother brahma will say it this way the
[18:50] church amen is living a thousand miles
[18:53] below their privileges another place he
[18:55] will say the church is living a million
[18:58] miles amen below their privileges so in
[19:00] other words what he is telling you is
[19:02] it's time for the church of the living
[19:04] god amen to come up higher amen it's
[19:07] time to come up higher john will say it
[19:09] like this amen let's come up higher
[19:11] let's come up in the power amen of the
[19:13] word of god now when you begin to look
[19:15] at all the benefits and the privileges
[19:17] of god amen there's no way to cover all
[19:19] the benefits of god amen but this
[19:21] morning if i could take for just a few
[19:23] moments with you amen i'd like to i'd
[19:25] like to speak to you on one here and it
[19:27] is on the benefit of inspiration amen
[19:30] that'll give us an understanding or that
[19:33] will broaden our understanding the
[19:34] prophet of god says in a message hear ye
[19:36] him he says now when a man is inspired
[19:39] and he reads the inspired word he said
[19:42] the two inspirations gives a result he
[19:45] said no matter how well you study the
[19:47] word it'll never do you no good so you
[19:49] are inspired yourself it takes your
[19:52] inspiration amen for the words already
[19:55] inspired so what we need today is an
[19:58] inspiration over us he said see amen the
[20:02] word amen god sweeping down with a new
[20:05] inspiration and breathing over us his
[20:07] power and his love in himself amen that
[20:10] it might inspire us amen and quicken us
[20:14] and awaken us to his word he said then
[20:16] the word being brought into the spirit
[20:18] of inspiration then you'll see miracles
[20:21] amen and things take place because the
[20:23] two amen just comes together amen so the
[20:26] word this morning is already inspired
[20:29] can you agree on that the word is
[20:31] already inspired amen so we didn't come
[20:33] here this morning to inspire the word
[20:36] amen but we came here that the word
[20:38] might inspire us amen then our
[20:40] inspiration connecting with the inspired
[20:42] word amen then you will see miracles
[20:44] amen the prophecy this way he said what
[20:47] type of people are we to be he said and
[20:49] inspired people amen amen aren't you
[20:51] thankful that god has sent a message
[20:53] amen that has inspired the church
[20:56] amen can you say amen amen the message
[20:59] of the hour has inspired the church we
[21:01] we are not an uninspired people amen we
[21:04] have received a message of inspiration
[21:07] he said see and inspired people through
[21:09] all ages amen acts strange to the world
[21:13] amen but they're doing god's will think
[21:16] about that an inspired people is strange
[21:19] to the world amen but they're always
[21:21] doing god's will amen i think it's
[21:24] amazing how that a prophet will begin to
[21:26] pick up this inspiration and in a
[21:28] message without money without price he
[21:30] said now the message has gone forth and
[21:33] i'm so glad that you received it how
[21:34] many this morning has received the
[21:36] message amen we received the message of
[21:39] the hour he said i'm so glad that you
[21:41] have received it and i pray that it'll
[21:43] do you good amen for it did me good to
[21:46] speak it
[21:48] in that powerful we have now received
[21:50] the message and i pray that it'll do you
[21:53] good for it did me good to speak it he
[21:55] said and i pray that the same
[21:58] inspiration somebody say the same
[22:00] inspiration amen the same inspiration
[22:03] that was given to me to speak it to you
[22:07] you received it in the same inspiration
[22:09] that it was sent in amen so the message
[22:12] was not sent in one inspiration and you
[22:15] received it in another inspiration amen
[22:18] and it's performed in another amen but
[22:20] the same inspiration that spoke it amen
[22:24] it's the same inspiration you received
[22:26] in him and the prophet said if you
[22:28] receive it in the same inspiration that
[22:30] was spoken you'll receive the benefits
[22:33] amen the same way it was spoke amen then
[22:36] may i say this morning this message is
[22:39] inspired amen the inspiration has not
[22:42] left this message amen the inspiration
[22:44] is on this message then right here this
[22:46] morning amen the same inspiration that
[22:49] was on the ohio river when the
[22:51] commission comes it's the same
[22:53] inspiration
[22:54] that is in this building today the same
[22:56] inspiration amen that came down in a
[22:59] tree and commissioned the prophet it's
[23:01] the same inspiration that is in the
[23:03] church of the living god amen there are
[23:06] no true inspirations amen the same
[23:08] inspiration that it was given to him
[23:11] that it was spoken it's the same
[23:13] inspiration you have received it in now
[23:15] amen when you look at this word
[23:17] inspiration it means the process of
[23:20] being mentally stimulated amen to do or
[23:23] to feel something it is especially to do
[23:26] something creative it is the quality
[23:29] amen of being inspired especially when
[23:32] evident in something i love this it is a
[23:35] sudden it is a brilliant it is a
[23:37] creative somebody say creative amen so
[23:40] inspiration deals with creation
[23:44] it is a sudden brilliant creative or
[23:47] timely idea it is the divine influence
[23:51] amen to believe believed to have led to
[23:54] the writing of the bible amen another
[23:56] place the word understanding means amen
[23:58] the ability he meant to understand
[24:01] something he meant to comprehend
[24:03] something amen to perceive the intended
[24:06] meaning of amen words of language or of
[24:10] a speaker amen now think about this amen
[24:13] understanding is not just hearing amen
[24:16] but it's actually catching it's actually
[24:18] receiving it's actually perceiving amen
[24:21] the intended meaning of what's being
[24:22] said i think it's amazing the prophet
[24:24] says in the first part of adoption he
[24:26] says i believe amen at this time he says
[24:30] i think it might be good to kind of
[24:31] bring the church to what i think to a
[24:34] complete understanding amen see
[24:36] positionally of what we are in christ
[24:39] jesus he said see preaching usually
[24:42] catches the sinner brings him under
[24:44] condemnation by the word he said but
[24:46] teaching places of man positionally amen
[24:50] knowing what he is and we can never
[24:52] rightly be able to have faith amen until
[24:55] positionally amen we know what we are
[24:58] amen then may i say this morning amen
[25:01] the bride now positionally amen by the
[25:04] word knows who she is amen the first
[25:07] seal the prophet said now watch he said
[25:10] it would be known in the last day but it
[25:12] comes forth in a church symbol do you
[25:14] understand it church it comes forth in a
[25:16] symbol amen of a church that they know
[25:19] there is a seal amen but just what it is
[25:21] yet they don't know because well it's a
[25:23] white horse rider he said but it's only
[25:26] to be revealed at the last day when the
[25:28] seal is actually broken broke into who
[25:31] amen not to christ amen but to the
[25:34] church amen so the opening of the seals
[25:37] amen was not coming to christ it was
[25:40] coming to the church amen notice oh my
[25:42] that just makes me tremble amen i hope
[25:45] the church truly understands it see amen
[25:48] your people i'm going to call you bright
[25:51] amen now we have quoted that for years
[25:53] we we have danced the aisles on that
[25:55] quote for years i'm no longer going to
[25:57] call you church i'm going to call you
[25:59] bride amen but there's a powerful sense
[26:02] behind that amen i'm no longer going to
[26:04] call you church i'm going to call you
[26:06] bride that you will understand amen see
[26:10] a prophet was not calling you bride amen
[26:13] just to separate you and give you
[26:15] another title he was calling you the
[26:17] bride amen because only the wife of a
[26:20] husband understands the secrets of a
[26:23] husband and he was fixing to release
[26:26] amen the rapturing faith he was fixing
[26:28] to release the mystery of the word and
[26:30] there was only going to be a group of
[26:32] people called the bride of jesus christ
[26:35] that would catch the revelation that
[26:36] would understand what was being said
[26:39] amen may i say this morning this message
[26:41] did not come amen to make a bunch of
[26:43] narrow-minded preachers it didn't come
[26:45] to make a narrow-minded church this
[26:47] message come amen to broaden our
[26:50] understanding in the word of god not in
[26:53] the ideas of man in the traditions of
[26:55] church but in the word of god now the
[26:58] prophet preaches a message to church and
[26:59] his condition amen he said i want to
[27:01] speak to you this morning he meant on
[27:03] the parable on some way that even the
[27:05] most unchurched person here would be
[27:08] able to understand he said now we come
[27:11] to church he meant to better ourselves
[27:13] right
[27:15] we come to church he meant to better
[27:17] ourselves we come to make ourselves
[27:19] better people better christians better
[27:22] citizens better fathers better mothers
[27:25] better neighbors he said we come because
[27:28] christ has told us if we would come and
[27:31] ask anything in his name where we are
[27:33] assembled together as many as two or
[27:35] three that he would be with us and he

[27:40] any more be any better to us today than
[27:43] to know that we have at the church for
[27:47] to embatter ourselves and to broaden our
[27:50] understanding see a prophet here is
[27:52] saying we're not looking for something
[27:54] to embed ourselves we're not looking for

[28:04] takes to embetter our understanding he
[28:06] says how many would say that's what i'm

[28:20] understanding of god it must come out of
[28:23] god's word amen for the word is what god
[28:26] gave us a meant to feed our hungry souls
[28:29] he says and the holy spirit somebody say
[28:31] the holy spirit the holy spirit was sent
[28:34] he meant to take the word of god and to
[28:37] feed us by the word amen then we are the
[28:40] sheep of his pasture amen right here
[28:43] this morning we are the sheep of his
[28:46] pasture he said now we're going to speak
[28:48] on that a little bit the sheep he said
[28:50] the threefold being of god when he could
[28:52] have complete control of us amen he can
[28:55] lead us and he can guide us now what did
[28:59] jesus say he said my sheep hear my voice
[29:03] and i know them amen and they follow me
[29:06] amen in the lean not to not understand
[29:08] him he said what is a voice a voice of
[29:10] course is his word when he is speaking
[29:12] in other words they will not understand
[29:16] a theological voice that's teaching
[29:18] contrary to the word for the sheep don't
[29:21] understand that no more than an eagle
[29:23] last night could understand the clucky
[29:25] to the hymn they don't understand it
[29:27] amen because he was an eagle and the
[29:30] same thing with the genuine born again
[29:32] child of god they only understand amen
[29:36] the things of god amen then god has not
[29:39] brought you here this morning to open
[29:41] your understanding amen to the ideas of
[29:43] psychology he has not called you ain't
[29:46] meant to open your understanding to the
[29:48] ideas of the nomination amen but he sent
[29:51] you a message
[29:53] what can we preach this morning he has
[29:55] sent you a message and that message has
[29:58] come amen to open your understanding of
[30:01] the word of god amen see them the spirit
[30:03] of the spirit of god comes down how many
[30:06] knows the spirit amen and the word come
[30:09] together the prophet said the spirit and
[30:11] the word causes the sheep to react amen
[30:14] have you ever been sitting in a service
[30:16] and you've been hearing the preacher
[30:18] preach and while he's preaching
[30:19] something on the inside of you begins to
[30:22] stir amen something begins to pulsate
[30:24] amen maybe he's preaching on something
[30:26] that has always been a mystery to you
[30:28] amen but all of a sudden amen it's like
[30:31] something just clicks
[30:33] have you ever been there he meant
[30:35] something just clicked you know what the
[30:37] prophet said he said you've heard your
[30:39] pastor preach a many a time on the word

[30:45] and they just screamed out now i know a
[30:46] lot of message people don't believe this
[30:48] no more but it's still in the message
[30:50] amen he said they just screamed out they
[30:52] could not hold their peace any longer he
[30:54] said why because the spirit of god takes
[30:58] the word of god to the congregation and
[31:01] feeds them and they grow spiritually on
[31:04] the word amen that when a person hears
[31:06] the word and that word connects amen
[31:09] with something on the inside of them and
[31:11] they can't hold their peace they got a
[31:13] shout out hallelujah amen amen thanks be
[31:16] to god amen that's not emotion amen

[31:34] the hour to let the word take
[31:37] preeminence in the church of the living

[35:35] in this age amen malachi 4 luke 17 30
[35:39] john 14 12 joel 2 28 these promises is
[35:43] exactly like john the baptist identified
[35:47] himself in the scripture then today

[36:44] the season you're living in this day
[36:46] this scripture is fulfilled amen then
[36:49] what are you saying i'm saying we're not
[36:51] looking for faith we have found faith
[36:54] amen faith has been delivered amen to
[36:57] fulfill the promises look here in jude
[36:59] chapter one verse three the bible says i
[37:02] exhort you that you should earnestly
[37:04] contend for the faith which was once
[37:07] delivered unto the saints amen jude here
[37:10] was going to write of the common
[37:12] salvation but the spirit moved over him
[37:15] inspiration moved over him and said
[37:17] don't write about that write about the
[37:19] faith that was once delivered to the
[37:21] saints he said see it had to come from
[37:24] somewhere if it was delivered to the
[37:26] saints he said see
[37:28] ask this question who delivered it who
[37:31] delivered this faith then he goes and
[37:33] says a little while and the world will
[37:35] see me no more yet you shall see me for
[37:38] i will be with you even in you to the
[37:40] end of the world and the things that i
[37:42] do amen shall you do also amen see he
[37:45] says the faith that he represented he
[37:48] delivered to the church to take it to
[37:51] the ends of the world then the faith to
[37:53] believe the message and to receive the
[37:56] message was the same faith that was in
[37:58] jesus christ
[38:00] glory to god it's not another kind of
[38:03] faith it's not a baptist faith it's not
[38:06] the denominational faith it's the faith
[38:08] of jesus christ and it's been delivered
[38:10] to the church to believe the message to
[38:13] receive the message amen see faith has
[38:16] come to believe that the book is open
[38:19] and to receive the open book amen how
[38:21] did we get the open book revelation 10 1
[38:24] a mighty angel descends amen which was
[38:26] christ amen with an open book and he
[38:28] delivers that open book to the seventh
[38:30] angel upon the earth see william branham
[38:32] is not the book of william branham it's
[38:34] the book of redemption it's the book of
[38:37] jesus christ it's the revelation in the
[38:39] hour you're living in him the prophet
[38:41] said see that seven seals and seven
[38:43] seals has the book sealed amen the book
[38:46] is
[38:46] absolutely sealed do you see it he said
[38:49] until the seven seals is broken amen how
[38:52] many thanks god for sending a prophet to
[38:55] break them seven seals amen to preach
[38:58] the revelation of them seven seals it is
[39:00] sealed up with seven seals now that's
[39:03] different he said from them seven
[39:04] thunders he says this is the seven seals
[39:07] on the book he says and the seals will
[39:10] not be released until the message of the
[39:13] seventh angel he says so we are
[39:15] presuming but the genuine revelation of
[39:18] god will be made perfect he meant in
[39:21] that sounding and vindicated truth he
[39:24] said see the seven sealed book remember
[39:27] it was closed in revelation the fifth
[39:29] chapter amen but in revelations 10 that
[39:32] book is open amen it's closed in
[39:34] revelation 5 revelation 10 that book is
[39:37] open amen then see what happened to us
[39:40] amen revelation was brought to us
[39:42] inspiration was brought to us the
[39:44] prophet says it like this in the breach
[39:46] he said see amen these messages are all
[39:49] kept until this earthly vessel until the
[39:52] time of god's appointed time at the last
[39:55] messenger of the earth he said and all
[39:57] these things that people has judged at
[39:59] and said i know it's there i believe
[40:01] it's there they fought at it they
[40:04] brought it forth and produced things by
[40:05] faith they believed it somebody say but
[40:07] now
[40:09] well say it like you're awake but now
[40:11] but now it's going to be brought to us
[40:14] in revelations and from the hand of god
[40:17] by vindication amen see it's going to be
[40:20] brought to us amen in revelations amen
[40:23] from the hand of god by vindication amen
[40:26] then notice this when brother branham
[40:28] talks about them seven seals i'm not
[40:29] going to read you all these quotes i've
[40:31] got them if you want to see them but it
[40:32] amazes me brother brother luis when
[40:34] brother brown talks about them seven
[40:36] seals he automatically connects the
[40:38] seven seals amen to inspiration here's
[40:41] what he says he says if you ever heard
[40:43] it if you ever believed anything i ever
[40:45] said in a sermon inspired you take them
[40:48] tapes of them seven seals amen and if
[40:51] you ever heard anything that's really i
[40:53] can say it's thus saith the lord get
[40:55] those amen that was in a message called
[40:57] perseverance souls that are in prison he
[41:00] says seven seals was finished and when
[41:02] those seven revealed truths and if i
[41:04] ever preached anything in my life that
[41:07] was inspired it was in that what shall
[41:10] we do with this jesus call christ who
[41:12] would dare amen say that was it the
[41:14] inspired word of god when he foretold it
[41:17] here and sent it out beyond the to
[41:19] arizona brought it right back even with
[41:22] science and everything else and proved
[41:24] it so amen this book is already opened
[41:29] amen a vindicated prophet's words this
[41:31] book is already open that's right it's
[41:34] just waiting for the seventh seal to be
[41:37] identified amen the coming of christ
[41:40] amen world again falling apart 63 if i
[41:43] ever preached anything that was inspired
[41:46] in my life it was in them seven seals i
[41:49] know we're at the end time
[41:52] are you hearing the words of a prophet i
[41:55] know we're at the end time in the feast
[41:57] of trumpets immediately after the angels

[42:02] prophet
[42:03] amen and preach them seven seals and if
[42:06] i ever said anything that was inspired

[42:13] i love this and the bible become a new
[42:15] bible he said there it opened up and
[42:18] revealed all the things that the
[42:20] reformers had left out it was the
[42:23] complete revelation of jesus christ
[42:25] altogether new to us amen but perfectly
[42:29] exactly with the scripture that was the
[42:31] word which has always been now notice
[42:34] this i was so inspired and directed he's
[42:38] just testified about receiving the sword
[42:41] in his hand which was the king's sword
[42:43] which was the word of the lord which was
[42:46] the vindication of his ministry and he
[42:48] says i was inspired and i was directed
[42:51] god's power to transform amen since the
[42:53] opening of those seven seals i'm not a
[42:56] broken record i'm going somewhere okay
[42:58] amen since the opening of those seven
[43:00] seals amen the angels just behind the
[43:02] mountain yonder this bible has become a
[43:05] new book it's the thing that's been hid

[43:10] revelation to him he would do and we are
[43:14] the privileged people amen what is a
[43:16] privilege it is an immunity it is a
[43:19] benefit it is a liberty it is a freedom
[43:22] it is an entitlement that is only given
[43:24] to a particular group of people we are
[43:27] the privileged people that god has
[43:29] chosen on the earth that we might see
[43:32] and understand these things which is not
[43:36] some mythical fleshly mind of a man of a
[43:39] person trying to make it up it's the
[43:41] word of god made manifest old church of
[43:44] the living god if anybody got a right to
[43:46] shout in lula georgia this morning it's
[43:49] the bride of jesus christ if anybody got
[43:52] a right to rejoice this morning it's the
[43:54] believers of the message of the hour you
[43:57] say what do we got to write this shout
[43:58] about amen you're seeing things that
[44:00] moses longed to sit in the service and
[44:02] hear you're hearing things that the
[44:04] apostles longed to hear but they did not
[44:07] live long enough to live in this time
[44:09] but here you are living right in the
[44:11] middle of it what are you saying
[44:13] preacher i'm saying come on eagles amen
[44:15] spreads your wings it's time to fly it's
[44:18] time to come into heavenly places
[44:22] this message didn't come to ground the
[44:24] church it come to lift the church
[44:27] come on now and then this message didn't
[44:29] come to ground us it come to lift us
[44:32] amen we was on the ground amen through
[44:34] the man age through the oxage through
[44:36] the lion age but under that fourth
[44:38] anointing amen would come a flying eagle
[44:40] which would be a sign amen of a group of
[44:43] people who were not earth-bound but they
[44:46] were heavenly bound people by the
[44:48] revelation of the hour they were living
[44:50] in
[44:52] now i know some people think i look they
[44:54] get a little emotional a little
[44:55] fanatical amen but let me just ask you
[44:57] something amen if a bunch of
[44:59] pentecostals have been painted face amen
[45:02] bob tared women amen can shout at a
[45:05] bunch of music amen if a bunch of
[45:06] deacons married four and five times amen

[45:12] you thank the redeemed amen privileged
[45:14] sons and daughters of god who has seen
[45:17] the word who has received the word let's
[45:19] believe the word don't you think we got
[45:21] a right to rejoice

[45:28] amen can you say amen
[45:30] amen we got a right to rejoice the word
[45:33] has been revealed he said see that we
[45:35] might see and understand these things
[45:38] now i read all those quotes about a
[45:40] prophet saying amen that those seven
[45:42] seals was inspired amen to come to this
[45:44] point he says i've never preached
[45:46] anything under inspiration that i had to
[45:50] take back
[45:52] now think about that he's never preached
[45:54] anything under inspiration that he had
[45:57] to take back he said see i never
[45:59] preached anything in my life under
[46:01] inspiration i had to take back because i
[46:03] don't depend upon my own understanding
[46:06] and if my understanding is contrary amen
[46:10] to god's word then my understanding is
[46:13] wrong
[46:14] so a prophet is sowing you if you're
[46:16] going by your understanding amen you're
[46:19] understanding it's wrong amen if you're
[46:21] going by denominations understanding
[46:23] your understanding is wrong amen but
[46:25] when you receive the understanding of
[46:27] god which comes by the inspiration of
[46:29] god he said it's got to be right always
[46:33] amen now what are you saying i'm saying
[46:35] this message is inspired
[46:38] without your opinions without your ideas
[46:42] without my interpretations without my
[46:44] faults this message is the inspired it's
[46:48] the inspired word of god revealed in the
[46:50] age we're living in amen how many knows
[46:52] the prophet told a story one time he
[46:54] said see he sent them them seven seal
[46:56] tapes and then they got down there in
[46:58] the interior of jamaica he said they
[47:00] were down there listening to him he said
[47:02] while they were listening to him a lot
[47:03] come in the room he said and a lot hung
[47:05] over the tape recorder that them tapes
[47:08] were playing on he said and he said they
[47:10] brought that picture to me he said we
[47:12] took that picture placed it by the
[47:14] picture here in houston coliseum in
[47:16] 1950s he said it was the same thing in
[47:19] houston coliseum that it was amen down
[47:22] there in jamaica
[47:25] amen has another vindication that the
[47:27] angel of the lord accompanies the
[47:30] message always
[47:32] are you with me the angel of the lord he
[47:35] does not accompany andrew glover's ideas
[47:37] he just not a company a preacher's
[47:39] thoughts but he does accompany the
[47:41] message because the message is the
[47:44] inspiration of god in the age we're
[47:46] living in
[47:47] now can i say it to you like this amen
[47:49] i'm not trying to be fanatical here amen
[47:51] but i do want to share something with
[47:52] you in case the devil's telling you that
[47:54] the message is no longer inspired amen a
[47:56] few weeks ago i was out in tucson
[47:58] preaching at doug baker's while i was
[48:00] preaching i was preaching along these
[48:02] lines right here and brother bob i
[48:04] looked over at brother doug and brother
[48:05] doug was just kind of staring up in
[48:07] space and i thought well even you know i
[48:09] didn't know what was going on he was
[48:11] just kind of looking at me had this look
[48:12] on his face well after service he come
[48:15] to me he said with andrew in the back
[48:16] room he said lander i don't mean to i
[48:18] don't mean to be to be fanatical he said
[48:20] i'm not he said i can count on my hands
[48:22] the time i've seen it he said but this
[48:24] morning if you notice me looking above
[48:26] your head i said i did he said i was
[48:28] looking he said because while you were
[48:30] preaching about that word being inspired
[48:32] he said there was a lot come in the
[48:34] building and it hung right over the
[48:35] pulpit amen i said brother doug that's a
[48:38] sign amen though oh god the angel of the
[48:41] lord is still with this message
[48:45] just say what the prophet said and watch
[48:47] the power of god amen come in the church
[48:50] say what the prophet said and watch the
[48:52] liberty of the holy ghost break over the
[48:55] people amen see we are in an age we are
[48:57] in an ephesian age the prophet said see
[48:59] we are given the understanding by the
[49:02] word somebody say by the word that we
[49:05] are going to understand it amen because
[49:08] it will come to an ephesian age and we
[49:11] are here for them calls this age an
[49:13] abrahamic age he says where are we in
[49:16] this great time we're standing this
[49:18] great hour we're living in he says all
[49:21] the visions has been fulfilled then he
[49:23] automatically turns amen to junior
[49:25] jackson's dream of the pyramid on top of
[49:28] it taken off little crowbar like saying
[49:31] reaching in there and getting those
[49:32] little rocks remember said see i stood
[49:34] there a little bit and then the holy
[49:36] spirit revealed it i said the entire
[49:38] bible as much as has been revealed to
[49:40] man through justification sanctification
[49:43] baptism of the holy ghost baptism in
[49:45] jesus name all these things has been
[49:48] revealed but there is secrets that's hit
[49:50] inside because the bible said that it's
[49:53] silva seven seals i must go there to
[49:55] find it he said then that morning when
[49:58] those seven angels come down and blasted
[50:01] the earth and rocks flew every way seven
[50:04] angels stood there and said return back
[50:06] to jeffersonville from where you come
[50:08] from for the seven seal of the seven
[50:11] mysteries will be open now listen this
[50:13] quote and here we are today
[50:17] can i preach here we are today i love
[50:20] how he says this brother zach
[50:21] understanding
[50:24] here we are today understanding he said
[50:28] serpent seed in a few days if god's
[50:31] willing we'll understand the correctness
[50:34] of marriage and divorce and all these
[50:36] things that god has opened every seal
[50:39] the mysteries since the foundation of
[50:41] the world and we've been in joy in the
[50:44] presence of his blessings that is true
[50:47] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[50:50] then the prophet told you before he went
[50:52] off the scene there's not another one
[50:54] coming amen to bring you understanding
[50:57] if you've got the holy ghost
[51:00] are you with me this morning if you got
[51:02] the holy ghost then the same holy ghost
[51:04] that was up on the mountain it's the
[51:06] same holy ghost in the pulpit the same
[51:09] holy ghost william branham had is the
[51:11] same holy ghost you got zach it's the
[51:13] same holy ghost you got brother lewis
[51:15] it's not a different holy ghost it's the
[51:18] same inspiration inspiring the church to
[51:21] believe the message
[51:24] i love it how the prophet said we've
[51:25] been in joy amen we haven't been
[51:27] depressed we ain't been sad we ain't
[51:30] been all tore up we have been enjoyed in
[51:32] the presence of his blessings
[51:36] do you see what happens when a prophet
[51:37] comes along and brings an understanding
[51:40] he brings a revelation amen to those who
[51:43] receive amen that word it settles the
[51:46] argument
[51:48] are you with me it settles it it's
[51:51] finished when a prophet speaks it's over
[51:54] see then the bible says there is a
[51:55] spirit somebody say a spirit there is a
[51:57] spirit in man it's not the spirit of a
[51:59] preacher it's not the spirit of a
[52:01] prophet it's the spirit of god it's the
[52:04] inspiration of the almighty that giveth
[52:07] them understanding look at what this
[52:09] word spirit means it means a wind
[52:12] it means a breath it means a mind a
[52:14] spirit of heaven it is a prophetic
[52:16] spirit i love this imparting a war like
[52:21] energy have you ever heard anybody say
[52:24] something negative about the message and
[52:26] something rose up in you as anybody in
[52:29] your presence amen amen ever said
[52:31] something a little a little negative
[52:33] towards the prophet or towards the word
[52:34] and something rose up in you it was like
[52:36] you wanted
[52:38] well let me just tell you in tennessee
[52:39] hillbilly terms it's like he is wanting
[52:41] to fight
[52:42] [Music]
[52:44] come on we're all human amen amen don't
[52:47] step on this message amen something rose
[52:49] up in you amen you didn't know what it
[52:51] was amen but a bible amen tells you it's
[52:54] an imparting a warlike energy it's a
[52:57] spirit in you it's a breath in you it's
[53:00] a wind in you the prophet said it this
[53:02] way in the battle for truth we are in
[53:05] the battle for truth he said them ends
[53:08] that has been lost well god said he
[53:11] would be restored again the last days i
[53:13] will restore saith the lord then ezekiel
[53:16] comes along and says a new spirit will i
[53:19] put within you amen i will take away the
[53:22] stony heart out of your flesh i will
[53:24] give you a heart of flesh the prophet
[53:27] said watch the order of the scripture
[53:28] now amen i will give you a new spirit i
[53:30] want you to watch the order he said they
[53:32] think they got the holy spirit but they
[53:34] just got a new spirit
[53:37] watch i'll give you a new spirit and a
[53:39] new spirit then will i put my spirit he
[53:43] said god had to give you a new spirit
[53:44] that's the new spirit god gave you so
[53:46] you could go along with the holy ghost
[53:48] amen with that old spirit you had you
[53:50] couldn't get along with your neighbor
[53:52] you couldn't get along amen with
[53:54] yourself so you know you couldn't get
[53:56] along with god amen so god gives you a
[53:59] new spirit amen see notice this and many
[54:02] times under enthusiasm i hope i'm not
[54:04] hurting but i hope i'm just uncovering a
[54:06] lot of times you think you'd have the
[54:08] holy spirit oh you said i sung i spoke
[54:11] in tongues being that close to it you
[54:14] might do all of that but that isn't the
[54:16] holy spirit yet see the holy spirit
[54:19] bears record of jesus christ amen then a
[54:23] new spirit will open within you then
[54:25] you'll receive my spirit the prophet
[54:27] said after a new spirit amen god
[54:30] promised he would put his spirit which
[54:32] is the holy spirit in us amen that will
[54:34] drive out fear it'll drive out unbelief
[54:37] it'll drive out reasonings it'll drive
[54:40] out fear oh you're hearing me the spirit
[54:42] of god will do to you what it did to
[54:45] elijah brother what did he do to elijah
[54:47] the prophet said it made elijah fearless
[54:52] he said i kind of believe that's added
[54:53] to the church now or anytime he said
[54:56] anybody's sickness nothing bothers us as
[54:59] long as the spirit of god is near and
[55:02] you know it amen amen are you hearing me
[55:05] amen can i preach to you amen y'all been
[55:07] through some sickness here lately amen
[55:09] but you're still here amen y'all been
[55:11] through some hard times here lately amen
[55:13] but you're still here amen brother
[55:15] dale's been fighting here lately but
[55:17] he's still here amen you know why
[55:19] because the same inspiration
[55:23] are you hearing the church the same
[55:25] inspiration that was there when the
[55:28] bible was being wrote it's the same
[55:30] inspiration amen y'all just celebrated
[55:32] 50 years didn't you amen 50 years amen
[55:35] has this church been dedicated he meant
[55:37] to the preaching of the message of the
[55:40] hour then the same inspiration that was
[55:42] there when edmond wave fell over it's
[55:44] the same inspiration in spoken word
[55:47] tabernacle the same inspiration that was
[55:49] there amen when hattie wright received
[55:51] her two boys it's the same inspiration
[55:54] that's in spoken word tabernacle you
[55:56] have received the message you have
[55:58] believed the message you've accepted the
[56:01] message
[56:02] oh glory to god what are you saying
[56:04] preacher i'm saying we are a fearless
[56:07] church by the inspiration of the holy
[56:10] ghost
[56:12] yes sir he should let a person ever be
[56:14] so sick and let the holy spirit come in
[56:16] the room and anoint that person you'll
[56:19] see a changed person in a few moments
[56:24] hello
[56:25] you'll see a changed person in a few
[56:27] moments yes sir why because his word
[56:30] which is scripture says by my stripes ye
[56:34] are healed
[56:36] i am the lord that healeth all thy
[56:38] diseases are you hearing me then what is
[56:41] scripture given by it is given by divine
[56:44] inspiration what did paul tell the temp
[56:46] say to timothy he said all scripture is
[56:50] given by inspiration of god he's now the
[56:52] prophet picks this up and says the same
[56:54] word somebody say the same word
[56:56] that inspired the disciples it inspired
[56:59] the first row of disciples then the next
[57:01] as they followed down to the lutheran
[57:02] age through the methodist age in every
[57:05] age and is just as sufficient
[57:08] and inspiring today to us as it was the
[57:11] first day it was given
[57:15] think about that amen the first time
[57:17] that moses read i am the lord that
[57:20] healeth all thy diseases amen that same
[57:23] inspiration that oh god are you with me
[57:26] that moved over moses to go before two
[57:29] million people with one prescription for
[57:31] a journey amen i am the lord god that
[57:34] healeth all thy diseases that same word
[57:37] is being preached here today and the
[57:40] same inspiration amen can we open up and
[57:42] have church amen the same inspiration
[57:45] that was on moses when he spoke it is on
[57:48] you when you read it and receive it it's
[57:51] the same word it's the same inspiration
[57:54] of god
[57:55] amen the prophet said see then what does
[57:57] real inspiration do he said real divine
[57:59] inspiration comes amen by doing the will
[58:02] of god it's not human inspiration amen
[58:05] it's divine inspiration see in other
[58:07] words the prophet says god would be
[58:09] known to his church not in three people
[58:11] but as one person the mystery of god
[58:14] would be revealed and when that was
[58:17] completely revealed then the seven
[58:18] mysteries would open the church because
[58:20] in there somebody say in there because
[58:24] in there the church would be living
[58:26] under the inspiration of the holy ghost
[58:30] the church would be living under the
[58:32] inspiration of the holy ghost he says
[58:35] him moving in and out and showing his
[58:37] signs of being alive and among us living
[58:40] among us we're then worshipping the
[58:42] living christ that is among us we are
[58:46] worshiping the living christ that is
[58:49] among us amen see that what is
[58:51] inspiration done it has been poured out
[58:54] somebody say poured out it has been
[58:56] poured out upon the elect of each age
[58:58] the prophet said if that genuine holy
[59:00] ghost is in you which is the word
[59:04] manifested you will see
[59:06] the message of the hour
[59:09] because it's the holy spirit that does
[59:11] it amen but if that if there has to be
[59:14] something like that off inspiration
[59:16] strike you and if you pour water on the
[59:18] ground on the ground and there's no seed
[59:21] in there to strike it how can they ever
[59:23] bring forth anything there's nothing
[59:25] there to bring forth that's it only the
[59:28] elected of god will see it he said see
[59:30] now while the inspiration's poured out
[59:33] amen together the bride together it's
[59:37] only the elected who will see it what
[59:39] did the prophet say he said an inspired
[59:42] people will always be a strange people
[59:44] to the world but they'll always be doing
[59:47] the will of god amen then he comes along
[59:49] in modern events and says when you see
[59:51] the church getting worldly like it was
[59:53] in the days of sodom you see the church
[59:55] world going into worship the god of this
[59:57] evil age and seeing that how many sees
[59:59] the church world getting worldly

[1:00:08] amen the church world is getting worldly
[1:00:10] amen amen sinners can look at
[1:00:11] denominations and see they're nothing
[1:00:13] but a bunch of hypocrites amen worldly
[1:00:16] amen sin loving amen immoral living are
[1:00:18] you with me this morning amen the church
[1:00:21] world is getting worldly at the same
[1:00:23] time the prophet said the world the
[1:00:26] church world amen is worshipping the god
[1:00:28] of this evil age how many knows they're
[1:00:30] worshiping the god of this evil age he
[1:00:33] said and see in that amen now we see the
[1:00:36] negative don't we brother bob we see
[1:00:38] sodom we see the church world getting
[1:00:40] worldly we see them worshipping the god
[1:00:42] of this evil age seeing that but then
[1:00:44] seeing a little minority group who would
[1:00:47] be gathered out under the inspiration of
[1:00:50] god producing again the life of jesus
[1:00:54] christ by the scriptures amen that's
[1:00:57] supposed to happen you know what hour

[1:01:42] name of the father of the son and the
[1:01:44] holy ghost you know why they're baptized
[1:01:46] like that because a man told them that's
[1:01:49] the way they all are baptized are you
[1:01:50] with me now amen you know why they're
[1:01:52] wearing makeup because a man told them
[1:01:54] it's okay you know why they're cutting
[1:01:56] their hair because a man told them that
[1:01:59] was paul's day that's not this day amen
[1:02:02] but william branham came along and
[1:02:04] picked up the bible and said it wasn't
[1:02:06] so from the beginning and for the first
[1:02:09] time in hundreds of years
[1:02:13] glory to god there is a bride on the
[1:02:16] earth who is not following a man she is
[1:02:19] following the son of man she's following
[1:02:21] the word that's been revealed in
[1:02:24] inspiration in the age she's living in
[1:02:28] glory to god come on church we ain't
[1:02:31] following a man we're following christ
[1:02:33] the word under inspiration
[1:02:38] producing again
[1:02:40] the life of jesus christ
[1:02:44] by
[1:02:45] the
[1:02:46] scriptures god have mercy
[1:02:49] producing
[1:02:50] the life of jesus christ
[1:02:54] by the scriptures see then what does the
[1:02:56] bible speak of the scriptures speak of
[1:02:58] two types of people
[1:03:00] a people
[1:03:01] without understanding
[1:03:03] and the people with understanding hear
[1:03:05] now this in jeremiah 5 21 hear now this
[1:03:09] oh foolish people and without
[1:03:11] understanding he says which have eyes
[1:03:15] and see not
[1:03:16] which have ears and hear not
[1:03:19] jesus comes along in matthew 15 16 and
[1:03:22] says are ye also yet without
[1:03:25] understanding he said see jesus is here
[1:03:28] with the spirit of god on him and it's
[1:03:30] come upon every one of you that's been
[1:03:32] born of the holy ghost and the devil
[1:03:35] doubter was upon them ecclesiastical
[1:03:38] clergy in them days and it's the same
[1:03:41] thing today
[1:03:44] isn't it amazing the same people brother
[1:03:46] that'll tell you you're fallen a man are
[1:03:48] the same people anointed with a doubting
[1:03:50] spirit
[1:03:56] it come from the devil without
[1:03:59] understanding he says spiritual
[1:04:02] understanding of the scriptures now
[1:04:05] watch this so people with a middle
[1:04:07] understanding amen they say well i got
[1:04:09] middle understanding they're still
[1:04:11] without spiritual understanding because
[1:04:13] to really read the bible with a
[1:04:15] spiritual understanding you must fall in
[1:04:18] love with the writer when paul was
[1:04:20] writing to the church of colosse in
[1:04:22] colossians 1 9 he says seek and to
[1:04:24] desire that you might be filled somebody
[1:04:27] say field
[1:04:28] with the knowledge of his will in all
[1:04:30] wisdom and spiritual understanding that
[1:04:33] she might walk worthy of the lord unto
[1:04:35] all pleasing being fruitful in every
[1:04:38] good work and increasing in the
[1:04:40] knowledge of god he says strengthened
[1:04:43] with all might according to his glorious
[1:04:46] power until all patience and long
[1:04:49] suffering with joyfulness see so the
[1:04:51] people of spiritual understanding they
[1:04:54] will stand alone but they will be
[1:04:56] gathered out there under the inspiration
[1:04:58] of god in the bible you read about
[1:05:00] joseph do you realize joseph was hated
[1:05:04] do you know why the prophet said because
[1:05:07] of his spiritual understanding in the
[1:05:09] book of genesis cain was a modern man
[1:05:12] who built a church he said he built that
[1:05:14] church by a mental understanding abel a
[1:05:17] spiritually minded man by election was
[1:05:19] elected to the truth of redemption by a
[1:05:22] spiritual understanding only those with
[1:05:25] a spiritual understanding will be able
[1:05:28] to overcome in the last days amen
[1:05:31] without an understanding of god you'll
[1:05:34] never overcome remember i said look on
[1:05:36] the opposite side how that moses stood
[1:05:38] there and pharaoh could not understand
[1:05:40] him he said he didn't have this
[1:05:42] spiritual understanding that moses had
[1:05:44] he said nor could he understand the
[1:05:46] attitude that moses taken do you realize
[1:05:49] this message has changed our attitude
[1:05:54] are you hearing me this message has
[1:05:56] changed our attitude brother louis it
[1:05:59] has changed the way we look at things it
[1:06:01] has changed our approach it has changed
[1:06:04] the way we handle tragedies it has
[1:06:07] changed the way we handle situations it
[1:06:09] has changed the way we handle death
[1:06:13] come on it has changed brother said
[1:06:15] moses stood there and pharaoh looked at
[1:06:17] him and pharaoh couldn't understand him
[1:06:20] because his understanding had changed
[1:06:22] his attitude amen do you realize we're
[1:06:25] an oddball we're an odd group of people
[1:06:27] i was down there the other day brother
[1:06:28] zach at sister karen pruitt's funeral
[1:06:31] amen let me just share this with you
[1:06:32] we're just walking out of the graveyard

[1:06:36] her body getting ready to be let down in
[1:06:38] the ground amen and and we're walking
[1:06:40] out of the graveyard and there's people
[1:06:42] standing around there talking about some
[1:06:44] morning between six and nine
[1:06:50] testing i said we're walking out of the
[1:06:52] graveyard they're fixing to let her body
[1:06:54] down and there's believers walking out
[1:06:56] of the graveyard talking about some
[1:06:58] morning between six and nine do you know
[1:07:00] what brother dale i think that those
[1:07:02] funeral directors have conventions year
[1:07:05] round to try to figure out what these
[1:07:06] crazy people are talking about in
[1:07:08] funerals when they're talking about some
[1:07:10] morning between six and nine ain't it
[1:07:13] but i'll tell you why we're talking like
[1:07:14] that because we had a prophet come who
[1:07:17] had understanding of the rapture and he
[1:07:20] said now here's the way i see it amen
[1:07:22] there's been three watches amen and some
[1:07:24] morning i think between 6 and nine the
[1:07:27] rapture will take place are you hearing
[1:07:30] me then you know what that tells me i
[1:07:32] can look the devil in the face and say
[1:07:34] for what you got at me but you ain't
[1:07:35] gonna defeat me amen because my attitude
[1:07:39] has been changed by the understanding of
[1:07:42] the opening of the word in the age i'm
[1:07:44] living in come on church let the devil
[1:07:47] throw a stroke in our brother dale he'll
[1:07:49] stand up and say is that the best you
[1:07:50] got devil let the devil fold covered at
[1:07:53] the church we'll stand up and say is
[1:07:55] that the best you got devil
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:07:58] are you hearing me our attitude has been
[1:08:01] changed by the understanding of the
[1:08:04] revealed word and the age we're living
[1:08:06] in
[1:08:07] glory to god where was moses's
[1:08:09] convictions coming from they was coming
[1:08:11] the prophet said by his spiritual
[1:08:13] insight he was seen in the unseen
[1:08:19] i ain't got time to stop here and preach
[1:08:21] on it but can i drop it to you for a
[1:08:22] second how many knows the prophet said
[1:08:24] amen you live between two worlds
[1:08:28] he said you live between two worlds it's
[1:08:31] a beautiful study sometime on visions
[1:08:33] amen he said i'm standing here and he
[1:08:35] said but i'm actually over there
[1:08:38] oh help me jesus i'm standing here but
[1:08:42] i'm actually over there
[1:08:44] he says now here's what happened then
[1:08:46] i'm speaking over there
[1:08:50] but you're hearing over here
[1:08:57] i'm speaking over there
[1:09:00] but you're hearing over here
[1:09:03] see he was seeing in another dimension
[1:09:06] but he was speaking and he was hearing
[1:09:09] what he was saying over here was coming
[1:09:12] from over there
[1:09:13] in other words he was not speaking to
[1:09:16] you as you were here he was speaking to
[1:09:19] you as he saw you there
[1:09:23] come on church amen if these preachers

[1:09:27] preach another sermon in their lives

[1:09:56] holy ghost they just sit there and they
[1:09:58] come dragging out as brother donnie says
[1:10:00] with a big old long mule face and they
[1:10:02] walk out after service and they go to
[1:10:04] golden corral and they're pushing their
[1:10:06] tray down the aisle and the woman at the
[1:10:08] end at the end of the aisle is trying to

[1:15:42] amen the number of years where of the
[1:15:45] word of the lord came to jeremiah the
[1:15:47] prophet that he would accomplish he
[1:15:49] meant 70 years in the desolations of
[1:15:52] jerusalem and i set my face unto the
[1:15:55] lord god to seek by prayer and
[1:15:58] supplications with fasting sack coffees
[1:16:01] sackcloth and ashes now you know brother

[1:16:58] well let me just preach we got a bunch
[1:17:00] of spiritual ignoramuses that's left his
[1:17:02] message and they think they're doing the
[1:17:04] church of favor by telling them that
[1:17:06] brother branham used some of larkin's
[1:17:07] material i think they're pumped crazy
[1:17:10] because brother branham told us that
[1:17:11] himself

[1:17:17] larkin's book dr smith's book dr
[1:17:20] schofield's notes

[1:17:24] everywhere and yet i cannot put theirs
[1:17:27] together to make it come out right i've
[1:17:30] been reading it and i'm trying to put it
[1:17:32] together man's inspiration man's
[1:17:34] understanding a prophet brother lewis
[1:17:36] was looking at it but he couldn't bring
[1:17:38] it together to make things come out
[1:17:40] right he said been visiting the
[1:17:41] libraries in kentucky and some of the
[1:17:43] ancient astronomy and calendars and
[1:17:45] times picking up from the libraries and
[1:17:47] so forth all the ancient books and
[1:17:49] having my trust solemnly in jesus christ
[1:17:52] to reveal it to me because i do not want
[1:17:55] it to say i know this and i know that he
[1:17:58] knows my heart he's listening at me but
[1:18:01] i want it that i might enlighten his
[1:18:03] people therefore i believe that he will
[1:18:07] give it to me then larkin didn't give it
[1:18:09] to him scofield didn't give it to him
[1:18:12] amen smith didn't give it to him amen
[1:18:14] but the lord himself amen give him the
[1:18:17] revelation
[1:18:19] are you healing me church and the
[1:18:21] prophet said now i bring that revelation
[1:18:24] to enlighten you upon your future you
[1:18:26] all are well taught on daniel's 70 weeks
[1:18:28] so i'm not going to dig into it but i am
[1:18:29] going to hit this high point and then
[1:18:31] we're going to go eat
[1:18:33] are you with me
[1:18:34] amen daniel was in captivity and gabriel
[1:18:37] come in there to instruct him on his
[1:18:40] future gabriel did not come he meant to
[1:18:43] comfort him in his captivity and to tell
[1:18:46] him daniel things are terrible and
[1:18:48] things are horrible he come to say
[1:18:50] daniel 70 years will be accomplished
[1:18:52] upon israel
[1:18:54] oh god but in the end there will be a
[1:18:57] people who will come out of here and may
[1:18:59] i say this morning church we was in
[1:19:01] captivity of denominations we was in
[1:19:04] captivity of man's ideas about the
[1:19:06] rapture
[1:19:08] come on church some of you always in
[1:19:10] captivity about the coming of the lord
[1:19:12] you thought you was going to be on 85 in

[1:19:17] and he was going to wreck your car and
[1:19:19] clothes was going to be laying on the
[1:19:20] interstate and
[1:19:22] come on but that was man's understanding
[1:19:25] sister june that was man's understanding
[1:19:28] that it brought the church into
[1:19:29] captivity

[1:19:49] on the serpent seed on the gifts of the
[1:19:51] spirit he meant on the water baptism on
[1:19:53] the godhead but all of a sudden he went

[1:19:58] angel that met moses the same angel that
[1:20:00] met paul met william branham and
[1:20:03] delivered him an understanding and he
[1:20:05] brought that understanding of the church
[1:20:07] and he said here it is there are no
[1:20:09] three gods there's one god here it is
[1:20:11] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:20:13] christ here it is the evidence of the

[1:26:53] tongues
[1:26:54] and kings
[1:26:56] preacher what are you saying i'm saying
[1:26:57] this
[1:26:58] you've been inspired
[1:27:00] to speak
[1:27:04] the devil
[1:27:06] has paralyzed your vocal cords
[1:27:09] long enough
[1:27:13] you've been crying
[1:27:14] long enough
[1:27:17] it's time to speak
[1:27:20] it's time to speak
[1:27:22] and it's time to move forward
[1:27:26] are you hearing me
[1:27:28] that devil's bound you long enough
[1:27:31] there's an inspiration in this body
[1:27:35] it's time to speak
[1:27:36] and it's time to move forward
[1:27:39] you're inspired
[1:27:41] you're inspired to do so you really you
[1:27:43] got a bob right there sis
[1:27:46] you realize in that bible there's
[1:27:48] there's thousands of verses
[1:27:51] but do you realize that bible was wrote
[1:27:53] under inspiration
[1:27:55] you realize that bible wasn't wrote
[1:27:57] under fear
[1:28:00] when david wrote i've been forsaken but
[1:28:03] the lord took me up that was not wrote
[1:28:04] under fear
[1:28:06] you know why when you're down and you
[1:28:08] feel forsaken and you go read that verse
[1:28:10] you know why something picks you up
[1:28:12] are you hearing me
[1:28:13] you know why something encourages you
[1:28:15] because there's a lingering inspiration
[1:28:18] over what was wrote
[1:28:21] so when she reads that if it was wrote
[1:28:23] under fear then a spirit of fear would
[1:28:25] come upon her
[1:28:27] because it was wrote under inspiration
[1:28:30] faith raises up in her heart
[1:28:33] you know there was a bible verse
[1:28:35] amen i'm trying to quit but y'all's
[1:28:36] pulling
[1:28:39] there was a bible verse in mark 11 23
[1:28:42] when jesus looked at a tree passed by a
[1:28:44] tree one day and he cursed it and said
[1:28:46] let it die
[1:28:47] cursed at the roots and let it die and
[1:28:48] it dried up died
[1:28:50] and he said these next words he said
[1:28:52] like this
[1:28:54] whatsoever things you desire
[1:28:57] when you pray
[1:28:59] believe
[1:29:00] you receive
[1:29:02] and you shall have them
[1:29:04] if you say to this mountain
[1:29:08] if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:29:10] removed and don't doubt in your heart
[1:29:13] that mountain will have to move do you
[1:29:15] realize the prophet was preaching for
[1:29:17] years and he said i could not preach on
[1:29:18] hell because i did not have an
[1:29:19] understanding
[1:29:21] he said then i come to mark 11 20 23 24
[1:29:24] i never could preach on it he said
[1:29:25] because i never had an understanding of
[1:29:26] that
[1:29:27] he said but then i'm giving you this and
[1:29:29] he says like this he said then i'm up
[1:29:31] there
[1:29:33] on the water
[1:29:34] fishing thinking on mark 11
[1:29:36] and there's a dead fish you know the
[1:29:38] story
[1:29:39] speak to the fish little fish gets his
[1:29:41] life back
[1:29:43] still saying
[1:29:45] he don't have understanding
[1:29:49] goes up to vermont in a meeting couple
[1:29:52] on the front row making love what are
[1:29:53] you going to do
[1:29:55] say the right thing i forgive him
[1:29:57] walks out forgiven

[1:30:09] squirrel hunting indiana kills three
[1:30:11] squirrels there still thinking on mark
[1:30:13] 11 but he can't preach on it and he
[1:30:15] finally tells the lord he says lord if
[1:30:16] you ever call me to preach on mark 11
[1:30:18] here's what i'll say
[1:30:19] it was six years before the atonement
[1:30:21] was made
[1:30:22] so the only thing i can say is it was
[1:30:24] christ that done it
[1:30:26] he said then i come down to kentucky to
[1:30:28] hunt on them squirt to hunt them
[1:30:29] squirrels is this okay
[1:30:32] he says i come down there and he said
[1:30:34] i'm sitting there thinking on mark 11
[1:30:36] and he says then he comes down and
[1:30:37] reminds me
[1:30:39] who was it that spoke through moses
[1:30:42] william branham who's speaking through
[1:30:43] you
[1:30:44] is it you saying those things he says
[1:30:46] it's me the lord speaking through you
[1:30:49] he receives the revelation listen the
[1:30:52] same inspiration that was up on jesus
[1:30:55] when he spoke mark 11 was the same
[1:30:57] inspiration come down upon brother
[1:30:59] branham to receive the understanding of
[1:31:02] mark 11. all right now i'm going to
[1:31:03] close right here he leaves the mountains
[1:31:06] runs down to the house and he's sitting
[1:31:08] there and on the other side of the wall
[1:31:10] sister june is a lady named hattie
[1:31:12] wright hattie wright is a widow woman
[1:31:15] she don't have hardly any money brother
[1:31:17] samuel but she's hearing a prophet speak
[1:31:20] about the third pull
[1:31:22] about speaking squirrels into existence
[1:31:24] and he looks at brother woods and
[1:31:26] charlie and he says the only thing i can
[1:31:28] say is he's still jehovah jireh
[1:31:32] the only thing i can say is he steal
[1:31:36] jehovah jireh he said hattie wright
[1:31:38] heard that on the other side of the wall
[1:31:41] and you know what she said
[1:31:43] that ain't nothing
[1:31:44] but the truth are you with me the same
[1:31:47] inspiration upon jesus to speak it was
[1:31:50] the same inspiration that came upon
[1:31:52] brother branham to believe it and to
[1:31:54] understand it brother lewis was the same
[1:31:56] inspiration that come up on hattie
[1:31:58] wright and she said that ain't nothing
[1:32:01] but the truth he said hattie whatever
[1:32:03] you ask it'll be given to you right now
[1:32:06] the healing of your sister shall get up
[1:32:08] a million dollars it'll come into
[1:32:10] existence right now whatever you ask
[1:32:12] hattie whatever you speak is yours and
[1:32:15] hattie wright looked at him and said
[1:32:16] brother branham i desire the salvation
[1:32:20] of my two boys let me leave you with
[1:32:22] this the reason why the devil don't want
[1:32:24] inspiration and understanding to come in
[1:32:27] the church is because when it does the
[1:32:29] devil loses his hope
[1:32:33] when inspiration and understanding comes
[1:32:37] in the church the devil
[1:32:39] the devil somebody shot the devil
[1:32:42] loses his hold and brother madam looked
[1:32:44] at her and said hattie i give you them
[1:32:47] two boys can we finish the trail of
[1:32:49] inspiration hattie wright's now come
[1:32:51] under that same inspiration and she's
[1:32:53] now received the salvation of her two
[1:32:56] boys on the other side of the wall was
[1:32:58] two rebellious teenagers who was
[1:33:01] laughing at what a prophet of god was
[1:33:03] saying but when heidi wright said the
[1:33:06] salvation of my two boys that same
[1:33:08] inspiration fell upon them two boys and
[1:33:11] they fell upon their face before god are
[1:33:13] you hearing the church what are you
[1:33:15] saying preacher i'm saying open up the
[1:33:17] door and let the inspiration of the holy
[1:33:20] ghost come back in the church
[1:33:22] as our musicians come
[1:33:25] let the inspiration of god blow again
[1:33:28] [Applause]

[1:33:46] that identified the first bull is the
[1:33:47] same one identified the second pool
[1:33:50] he said but aaron is the same one that
[1:33:51] has identified the third pull
[1:33:53] and he says the third pull
[1:33:55] is
[1:33:56] here
[1:33:58] so what he said
[1:33:59] the third pull is here

[1:57:05] good time we had a real good time
[1:57:07] yesterday in the youth service and the
[1:57:09] youth here today and
[1:57:11] and i'm like brother andrew they if they
[1:57:13] can if they can build a website
[1:57:15] they can understand this message
[1:57:18] if they get the inspiration to build to
[1:57:21] build a website they can get the
[1:57:22] inspiration to study this message and
[1:57:25] and they get the same holy ghost we do
[1:57:27] it's not a young one
[1:57:29] it's the same holy ghost and man the
[1:57:31] holy ghost is not old or young it's the
[1:57:32] same right and it affects people the way
[1:57:35] you want it to affect you
[1:57:37] remember the holy ghost is a gentleman
[1:57:40] he'll only do what you allow him to do
[1:57:42] you say no that's god he can do whatever
[1:57:45] sure but our prophet that he's been
[1:57:47] talking about for two days our prophet
[1:57:49] said he was a gentleman
[1:57:51] the holy ghost was a gentleman he was
[1:57:52] timid he would he would go out on a limb
[1:57:55] if you if you did something wrong so we
[1:57:58] want to invite him in i believe we
[1:57:59] invited him today
[1:58:01] i believe he got invited back into some
[1:58:03] hearts that maybe we're
[1:58:04] going astray a little bit maybe we're
[1:58:06] not
