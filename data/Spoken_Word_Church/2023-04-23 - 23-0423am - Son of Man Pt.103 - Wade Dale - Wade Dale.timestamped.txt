[26:10] class or a cooking class no date has
[26:11] been set
[26:12] yet now May the
[26:15] 7th May the 7th I know I'm jumping
[26:17] around a little bit but I just
[26:18] remembered these as I was writing them
[26:20] down May the 7th here at the
[26:23] church at the second
[26:25] service all right we will have a vow
[26:28] renewal service all right if you want to
[26:31] renew your vows with you and your
[26:33] sweetheart buy her a
[26:35] bouquet and we will have a vow renewal
[26:38] we've done this several times over the
[26:39] years and then also we will warm the
[26:43] pool up outside and if you want to be
[26:46] baptized or re-baptized we're going to
[26:49] have that the same thing on the second
[26:52] service on May the 7th all right is
[26:54] everybody with me that's the weekend
[26:57] before
[26:58] Mother's Day all right so May the 7th
[27:00] vow renewal and baptismal service if you
[27:03] want to be re-baptized or baptized
[27:05] that'd be a good time we baptized 20
[27:07] people last year and we sure appreciate
[27:09] the Lord being with us and then I pray
[27:12] that the Lord will carry on what he's
[27:15] doing with those 20 and then more and

[29:02] amen so some of you that are that are
[29:05] that are here as visitors um I'm a
[29:08] little slow southern guy so we're on
[29:10] part 103 that's 103 sermons so it's been
[29:14] a year or so we've been on this on the
[29:16] son of man and we haven't even got to
[29:18] the son of man yet we're actually on the
[29:19] Statue of a perfect man so if you'll
[29:21] just bear with us I'll try to background
[29:23] a little bit but let's read the
[29:25] scripture in the beginning was the word
[29:27] the the word was with God and the Word
[29:28] was God and the Word was made flesh now
[29:32] 2,000 years ago the word was made flesh
[29:37] amen not
[29:39] all that's not all and the Word was made
[29:43] flesh right here yes sir just as the
[29:47] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[29:50] there he's here now in the hearts of his
[29:53] Believers making us what him made
[29:56] manifest in another form called The
[29:58] Bride not two different people but these
[30:00] two are one as we were at the U at the
[30:04] wedding yesterday we these two are now
[30:06] one one flesh and the Word was made
[30:09] flesh and that's what we're trying to
[30:10] pick up the thought today and dwelt
[30:12] among us and we beheld his glory the
[30:14] glory of the only begotten of the father
[30:16] full of grace and truth you can have
[30:17] your seats and we'll finish reading
[30:20] second Peter 1 verse5 says besides this
[30:22] giving all diligence in other words
[30:25] diligence not dilator
[30:28] diligence add to your faith now it's
[30:30] become your
[30:33] faith brother R said this is my eye God
[30:36] gave it to me this is my Holy Ghost God
[30:39] gave it to me it's not his anymore it's
[30:41] mine all right I possess that in my soul
[30:45] so in our soul we're born again but
[30:47] remember the spirit realm or the
[30:50] memories and conscious effects and
[30:51] Imagination that is still bombarded by
[30:54] the devil that is where the greatest
[30:57] battle ever fought is in your mind and
[30:59] it's your memory if your memory don't
[31:01] bother you today then come
[31:05] preach reasoning conscious affs and
[31:08] Imagination all these things are
[31:10] contrary to God or they can be used by
[31:12] God one of the two and we're praying
[31:14] today that if you're born again in the
[31:16] soul you don't have faith and doubt you
[31:18] have faith or doubt you don't have the
[31:20] devil and God you have one or the other
[31:23] today there's no gray area now you can
[31:25] be you can be heading toward the new
[31:27] birth you can be justified you can be
[31:30] Sanctified but without the baptism of
[31:32] holy ghost in your soul to burn that old
[31:34] nature out of you you are of the
[31:38] devil I'm just plain the things I did I
[31:42] do them no more why the thing that made
[31:44] me do it is not in there anymore all
[31:46] right praise the lord we believe in
[31:48] Salvation in this church we believe in
[31:50] Redemption we'll talk about that in just
[31:51] a second but this is a furtherment of
[31:53] the Plan of Redemption not just to get
[31:55] you born again but to get get you an
[31:58] active participant in the economy of God
[32:00] or the plan of God all right you can be
[32:03] born again that's fine but listen we
[32:06] have babies here today and and some very
[32:09] new ones and you know they're sweet and
[32:11] they're lovely and you know we do all
[32:12] the things for them and and they're cute
[32:14] and beautiful but you don't take that
[32:16] baby as soon as it's born and put it in
[32:18] a closet and shut the door oh that's a
[32:20] beautiful baby you know you could
[32:21] probably put a a a window and say oh
[32:23] it's a pretty baby about a month later
[32:26] that baby's going to what die that's
[32:28] right even though it be a human even
[32:30] though it be a baby so we believe in a
[32:33] furtherment of the Gospel in this church
[32:35] we believe in growing in Grace and
[32:37] knowledge as the Bible tells us the only
[32:40] way to do that is by a five-fold
[32:43] Ministry all right Apostles prophets
[32:45] Pastor I'm just telling you what the
[32:46] Bible says can't erase that out of the
[32:47] Bible the Bible says the only way you
[32:49] going to get perfected is by listening
[32:51] to the message of the hour through a
[32:53] five-fold Ministry all right you can get
[32:56] born again listen to tapes you can get
[32:57] bored again reading books if you want to
[33:00] but you cannot grow without a solid
[33:03] Ministry to help you grow now we know
[33:05] that right and besides just giving all
[33:08] diligence add to your faith now it's
[33:11] become your faith that's at the bottom
[33:12] of the pyramid that's your faith yes so
[33:15] you're going to add to your faith virtue
[33:16] and The Virtue knowledge you say brother
[33:18] way I've already got these things the
[33:20] prophet told us yeah you as a
[33:23] baby have every faculty to become a
[33:26] mother
[33:28] or a father but guess what not going to
[33:32] happen till you get
[33:33] older so you're not growing any new
[33:36] parts so in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[33:38] we're not growing any new parts we're
[33:40] just growing in Grace and knowledge
[33:42] we're growing in what God wants us to do
[33:45] we we didn't know when we were a kid
[33:48] that that oven was hot as Josh our son
[33:51] first word he said was hot because the
[33:52] oven stayed on he stayed at Nanny's a
[33:54] good bit Nanny runs them yeah there oven
[33:57] oven you hear that not Michael wave
[33:59] oven okay all right or
[34:04] drive-thru what do you
[34:06] have but he said
[34:08] hot you know why he said hot he touched
[34:11] it one time didn't touch it again but
[34:14] now he's 40 we'll be 40 this year Lord
[34:17] 40 wow yeah everybody go ahead
[34:20] wow but he'll be 40 this year he don't
[34:23] say that anymore he knows it's hot same
[34:26] way with you and I we didn't know what
[34:29] we were doing when we got born again
[34:30] even like yesterday when
[34:32] those listen I'm not laughing for no
[34:35] other purpose but it just shows you one
[34:37] thing you can have a purity in your
[34:40] Humanity amen they didn't even know how
[34:43] to
[34:44] kiss because they' never done it before
[34:48] hallelujah how many y'all can say don't
[34:50] raise your
[34:52] hand your wedding day was that your
[34:54] first kiss nope not my most of you I
[34:57] know Bob and Monica for sure cuz he told
[34:59] us that but they were so
[35:03] awkward but it was so cute and it was so
[35:06] innocent cuz they got married and now
[35:09] they're going to be able to enjoy they
[35:10] don't know what that kiss is now amen
[35:12] and they'll lawfully be able to do what
[35:14] they can do with that kiss amen they can
[35:16] carry it on and that's what with the
[35:17] Lord Jesus when you get born again
[35:19] you're a baby in Christ you make
[35:20] mistakes you fall down you hit the wall
[35:23] uh you throw food you know you you get
[35:25] choked on something but boy as you get
[35:27] older guess what God expects you to walk
[35:30] on your own God expects you to study on
[35:33] your
[35:35] own God expects you to give back to him
[35:40] what he's already give you which is the
[35:42] scripture and the word of God and the
[35:44] message of the hour amen We Believe
[35:46] without the message of the hour you
[35:48] might you might slide in the Rapture but
[35:51] I doubt
[35:52] it don't get quiet on me now we believe
[35:55] that
[35:57] and besides this giving all diligence
[35:58] add to your faith virtue to Virtue
[36:00] knowledge to knowledge Temperance
[36:01] Temperance patience to patience
[36:03] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[36:05] kindness and we're heading to that in
[36:07] just a little bit and brotherly kindness
[36:10] charity 1 Timothy 3:16 Says look without
[36:13] controversy listen when the prophet of
[36:15] God came on the earth there was so much
[36:17] controversy Till There Was denominations
[36:20] everywhere and he was preaching to
[36:23] them in their Arenas and in their
[36:26] churches yes amen but now we've come to
[36:29] a place that I don't I know for sure I
[36:32] passed three Baptist Church one of them
[36:34] Jun and I got married in 40 something
[36:36] years ago 43 years ago 44 years ago
[36:39] coming up I'm not going I didn't stop in
[36:41] that
[36:43] church I come to this one why I know
[36:46] that that's not where I need to be I
[36:49] know what the Baptist teaching is a
[36:51] Methodist teaching is and look at the
[36:52] Methodist Church now even our little
[36:54] town of Gillsville 300 people there's a
[36:57] few Methodist churches and one of them
[36:58] suing one one suing the other and
[37:00] they're suing each other and they're not
[37:02] United Methodist Church anymore they
[37:04] have been pulled apart why cuz some say
[37:07] we ain't going to have a gay woman
[37:08] standing in the pull pit and some says
[37:09] well that's okay we can everybody's the
[37:13] same
[37:16] no God gives us a
[37:19] standard and when brother Brown came on
[37:21] the scene that standard was so
[37:23] convoluted that standard was so fogged
[37:26] up
[37:27] he calls it Loose Ends there was so many
[37:30] Loose Ends till to to even a new
[37:33] Christian didn't know what in the world
[37:34] to
[37:35] do but now as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[37:38] in 2023 after 60 something years after
[37:41] the prophet left we are finally seeing
[37:44] that without
[37:47] controversy you don't have to try to
[37:49] prove to me that brother R was a prophet
[37:51] I know
[37:52] that I'm sold
[37:55] out
[37:57] the voice of the day but I know one
[37:59] thing for sure that voice wasn't quite
[38:02] it came and rang out in a group of
[38:03] people called the bride and the bride
[38:06] knows what she's doing with the word
[38:08] today like never before so without
[38:11] controversy great is the mystery of
[38:13] godliness Absolut God was manifest In
[38:15] the Flesh
[38:16] who that's Jesus well yeah that's you
[38:19] too amen justified in the spirit Sint of
[38:23] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[38:24] believed on the world received up the
[38:26] glory now great is the mystery without
[38:30] controversy in other words without
[38:31] dispute without quarrel I'm not going to
[38:34] quarrel over you that brother Brown was
[38:35] a prophet or not I'm not going to
[38:37] quarrel over you that there's one true
[38:38] and living God I know there is the Bible
[38:41] backs it up all right I don't want to
[38:44] hurt your feelings but you you've been
[38:46] here a long time you know what I'm
[38:47] saying I don't need a quote to tell me
[38:49] that absolutely it's in my heart this
[38:53] comes from my heart it comes from your
[38:55] heart sure we love the quote you're
[38:57] going to hear me right here there's one
[38:58] right
[38:59] there but I don't need a quote to
[39:01] explain to me what a
[39:04] baptism I can see in the Bible when I
[39:07] was 14 years old wasn't even born again
[39:09] we come in the message you know when I
[39:10] was like 9 8 1968 and I could read the
[39:14] Bible and when I become 14 years old I
[39:16] kind of knew what happened in the
[39:18] garden wasn't an apple that got me in
[39:21] trouble everybody with me so this great
[39:24] Plan of Redemption we're beginning to
[39:27] see more because the prophet tells us
[39:29] and we'll look at that in just a minute
[39:30] and this afternoon um brother Ryan we're
[39:33] going to talk a little bit about choice
[39:34] we're going to slide that in there just
[39:35] a little bit cuz I believe in making a
[39:37] choice I believe in free moral agency I
[39:39] don't believe you came here with eternal
[39:41] life and that's all there is and you're
[39:42] not going to do anything but be you know
[39:44] this and have a halo around your head I
[39:46] don't believe that I don't believe
[39:48] brother rown believe it either because
[39:49] I'm going to read you where brother
[39:50] Brown said God gave you a choice he said
[39:53] you people out here today you have a
[39:55] choice yes choose God or choose death
[39:59] Cain you had a choice if you'll do well
[40:01] listen it wasn't even through a preacher
[40:04] God himself told Cain if you'll do good
[40:08] but if you don't what sin L at the door
[40:11] so you and I we have choices even though
[40:13] I'll read you where brother Brown said
[40:14] God made a choice God didn't have to
[40:17] have us that's right he was
[40:19] self-existent he was Ill on him he
[40:21] didn't need the world he didn't need me
[40:23] and you but you and I were inside of him
[40:25] an attribute born you and I were inside
[40:28] of him in the eternal life that he had
[40:30] to give as a father and as a son and
[40:34] coming down in the Plan of Redemption to
[40:36] be the bloody lamb this was his plan
[40:39] that's right and we're just what we're
[40:40] supposed to get into the
[40:42] plan now remember what is a plan a plan
[40:45] is something that you structure together
[40:47] toward an end yes sir something you put
[40:49] together all of youve made plans house
[40:51] plans plans for your future plans for
[40:54] this plans for that and guess what being
[40:56] human beings they get derailed about as
[40:58] long fast as we write them down is that
[41:00] all right they get just as soon as we
[41:02] write a plan down it changes God's plan
[41:06] never will
[41:10] change so this Plan of Redemption is set
[41:14] in blood yes it is it's a plan like a
[41:18] coach at a football team you know he's
[41:21] got the plan and he he's got a plan to
[41:23] what win I've never seen a coach that
[41:24] went to a football game had a plan to
[41:26] lose
[41:27] he had a plan to win God had a plan to
[41:30] win he had a plan though first to show
[41:32] his attributes down Through the Ages and
[41:35] not just be that we're this you know
[41:37] zombie walking around uh not being able
[41:40] to have our own choice and not be able
[41:42] to have our own free will and to worship
[41:45] Our Father the way we're supposed
[41:47] to everybody with
[41:49] me so this coach has a has a plan and
[41:54] every plan when I play football you you
[41:56] know all the X's and O's were on the
[41:57] board when I was growing up they still
[41:59] had Blackboard sorry about that you're
[42:01] do it on the computer now but most of
[42:03] you that don't know what a Blackboard
[42:05] is and being a teacher's pet wasn't an
[42:08] apple that was taking them erasers and
[42:09] going outside and making all kind of
[42:11] dust everybody know what I'm talking
[42:13] about raise your hand you young people
[42:15] don't even know what I'm talking about
[42:17] you'd come in you'd have chalk all over
[42:19] you you have it on your head you'd have
[42:20] it in your hands but you know what you
[42:22] were the teacher's pet cuz she would use
[42:24] that to erase the board when she was
[42:27] writing stuff on it okay so he put He
[42:30] put a plan up he said we're going to do
[42:32] this we're going to run this we see the
[42:34] weakness of the team and this is what we
[42:35] want to do but you know what that coach
[42:37] couldn't take that piece of paper and go
[42:40] out to the 50 yard line and throw it on
[42:41] the field and
[42:43] win everybody with me it took what
[42:47] execution by
[42:49] him it took an execution of that plan
[42:52] and the coach knew that I'm going to put
[42:54] the best player right here I'm going to
[42:55] put the best player here but the best
[42:57] player here that I know of and listen
[42:59] when God puts the player in place he
[43:01] don't ever change
[43:03] him all right so we're not talking about
[43:06] a plan that we see on television you see
[43:08] well we're going to pass a little bit no
[43:09] we can't pass cuz they're doing this we
[43:11] got to change God never changes that's
[43:13] why I love the word of God it never
[43:15] changes every plan this whole Plan of
[43:16] Redemption never
[43:18] changes now man has changed it that's
[43:21] why I tell you cuz let me tell you there
[43:23] was a a guy named Satan that was his
[43:26] assistant
[43:29] coach he had his own idea though he
[43:32] wanted his own plan so he got his own
[43:35] players and it's been a fight ever since
[43:37] but he just knows he just don't know
[43:39] that he is
[43:40] whipped he's whipped from the beginning
[43:43] so which so so which team are you on
[43:47] today amen if you'll be on the winning
[43:50] team get on the team that executes the
[43:52] word of God his brother Ryan was talking
[43:55] about you know you know you you you got
[43:57] to look at the words I don't I don't
[43:58] like that word execute when they're
[43:59] killing somebody but execution means
[44:02] that you're doing something you're
[44:03] getting something done so we're going to
[44:05] have we're going to execute the plan but
[44:08] remember what we were talking about in
[44:10] the Garden of Eden and this Plan of
[44:11] Redemption we're going to read here in
[44:12] just a little while where we look in the
[44:15] garden and you see two
[44:16] trees now we as um you know looking here
[44:21] and watching like we would a TV screen
[44:25] you would think well one of these trees
[44:26] the tree of life is just
[44:29] beautiful brother Robbie it's just every
[44:32] limb is
[44:34] straight no leaves fall it's so
[44:38] beautiful sunshines on it and it
[44:39] glistens and
[44:41] glows that may not be because my tree of
[44:43] life had a crown of
[44:47] thorns my tree of life had stripes on
[44:49] his back my tree of life had holes in
[44:52] his hands my tree of life had holes in
[44:55] his feet
[44:59] ugly the world didn't want to look on it
[45:02] that's my tree of life but the tree of
[45:05] knowledge of Good and Evil no that's the
[45:08] one with straight limbs beautiful
[45:12] flowers cuz which one did they choose am
[45:15] which one did you choose but now we tell
[45:18] I'll tell you that what the prophet said
[45:20] though it's not the Tree of Life over
[45:22] here and the Tree of Life of knowledge
[45:23] of Good and Evil over here right what
[45:26] did the prophet of God tell us they
[45:29] intertwined their limbs and you couldn't
[45:31] tell one from the
[45:33] other wow that's coming to the end time
[45:36] that's coming where we're going to talk
[45:37] about anoing ones at the end time a
[45:38] little bit later on because when you
[45:39] come to Godliness there is a godliness
[45:41] that you're supposed to be like and then
[45:43] there's a form of godliness that you
[45:45] better not be like but it is a form of
[45:47] godliness but denying the power thereof
[45:50] and that's what Satan did he denied the
[45:52] power of God and he got his own team and
[45:54] he got his own players and he went One
[45:56] Direction but you know what he wants to
[45:57] fight to get back he'll never get
[46:00] back praise the Lord so this Plan of
[46:04] Redemption is for
[46:06] real and it's not something that you got
[46:09] you know I you coach I see the I see the
[46:12] play but I don't want to do
[46:15] that I don't want to do
[46:18] that that was one time make it a little
[46:20] funny that was one time I was I'm the
[46:23] center I was the center of the of the
[46:25] team Center
[46:27] Snapper so this guy runs in from the
[46:30] side we used to run our plays in from
[46:32] the sidelines you'd run an extra you one
[46:33] guy in and one guy out well this guy
[46:36] comes running in he's flying in you know
[46:37] and he comes up and he he gets in line
[46:39] he gets right beside of me cuz he's
[46:41] playing guard he gets right beside of me
[46:43] in the Huddle and we kind of lean over
[46:44] and here's a
[46:47] quarterback
[46:50] silence Rick not it wasn't Ricky then it
[46:52] was Dan he said what's the
[46:54] play he said I
[46:58] forgot I said run something just run
[47:02] something and then when we got and the
[47:04] coach said why' y'all run that
[47:06] play I said coach I ain't going to call
[47:09] his name bless his heart he's not here
[47:11] today he forgot so we just improvised
[47:15] and ran our own play well that's not the
[47:16] way with God we we can't run our own
[47:19] play cuz God's going to say why' you do
[47:22] that that makes it a little Elementary
[47:25] so uh like Ryan I like Ryan how Ryan
[47:27] weaves everything into his life because
[47:30] you know what that's where it's
[47:32] at in the Life brother R said that's
[47:34] where we're losing it too is in that
[47:36] life but we are winning it in that life
[47:39] if we live it correctly under his Plan
[47:42] of Redemption all
[47:45] right and then we'll come to that great
[47:48] as we were talking about the third pull
[47:50] which is pulling us to something it's
[47:52] not pushing us it's pulling us to
[47:53] something all right so brother Brown now
[47:55] how does he how do we know this plan
[47:57] though how do we know this plan's
[48:00] real well that's God he must be no
[48:04] there's a Playbook called a Bible but
[48:07] the master coach stood back before time
[48:11] and by Foreign knowledge by him foreign
[48:14] knowing what you would do he then pulled
[48:18] himself back and predetermined this
[48:21] whole thing now that way I'll agree with
[48:23] you I will not agree with those people
[48:25] says you don't have a choice now brother
[48:27] BR plainly tells us he did not put you
[48:31] in a tube and pull you through it now
[48:36] plainly but you know what that is
[48:41] predestination that's why it's not a
[48:42] good thing to use if you're not
[48:45] knowledgeable
[48:46] right cuz you say oh no cuz predeter
[48:49] predestination is
[48:51] predetermined destiny that means when
[48:53] you got here your destiny was already
[48:55] predetermined
[48:56] now that's absolutely the truth in the
[48:58] mind of God cuz it can't change if God
[49:02] ever loved you he'll never unlove
[49:05] you if he never did he never will I
[49:09] agree with that but listen we got to
[49:10] come down into
[49:13] time time is where Redemption happens
[49:17] time is where he is our
[49:19] father time is where he is our savior
[49:22] our healer Our Redeemer but what's he
[49:25] doing with this plan he's taking us back
[49:27] to the Garden of Eden Before Time ever
[49:30] happened now I'll agree with you there
[49:32] but I will not agree that there's
[49:35] nothing I can do about this is just the
[49:36] way I am y'all know brother Dell hadn't
[49:38] preached that in 50 years one thing's
[49:41] for sure you have a choice of everything
[49:43] you do all right you can believe it and
[49:46] accept this today or you can reject it
[49:48] cuz brother R said by your choice I'll
[49:49] read it this afternoon by your choice
[49:52] that's where he got the quote that we
[49:54] like to quote where he said you either
[49:56] better or worse when you go out that
[49:58] door why cuz you got to make a
[50:00] choice every service we make a
[50:04] choice well I'm just not going to come
[50:06] well that's your choice but you're
[50:08] against the
[50:10] plan see you go back to the plan you're
[50:12] against the plan of God so for knowledge
[50:15] looks back and says that he foresaw this
[50:18] he knows that's the reason he could tell
[50:20] the end from the beginning so he looks
[50:22] all down through your life he sees what
[50:24] you do he sees what what would I do if I
[50:26] didn't even meet you you said oh no that
[50:28] ain't no God is infinite absolutely
[50:32] infinite that means he knows that way
[50:34] that way that way that way what you
[50:36] chose and what you will chose somewhere
[50:38] else some other way
[50:43] wow let me tell you we'll talk this
[50:46] afternoon for some of you that not going
[50:47] to be here there's one thing for sure
[50:51] you did not make a choice to get
[50:53] here you had no choice choice of how you
[50:56] got
[50:57] here that was God's
[51:00] choice he even actually saw your
[51:03] character and put it in a germ in an
[51:07] egg and then met your mama with your
[51:11] daddy and got you here but once you get
[51:13] here that's when your choice
[51:16] begins I'll read it I've got about 10
[51:18] quotes this afternoon I'm going read
[51:20] where stat said exactly he said God made
[51:23] a choice to get you here
[51:26] you had no choice to get here but God
[51:29] found the
[51:31] character in your
[51:33] mama and your
[51:36] daddy and put them together in holy
[51:38] wedlock and guess what out you came to
[51:41] do what to make a choice now when you
[51:43] got here God knew what choice you're
[51:44] going to make cuz he already saw you
[51:46] getting here that's just to me is a so
[51:50] simple that God saw it all first for
[51:53] knowledge he had knowledge of it
[51:55] beforehand yes sir he knows who's going
[51:57] to go up the statue of perfect man he
[51:59] knows who's not but he makes it
[52:01] available for
[52:04] everyone and these virtues as according
[52:06] to the prophet said in the statute of
[52:07] perfect man these are required listen
[52:10] these are required
[52:14] curriculum if we go to school if we're
[52:16] going to have a plan if we're going to
[52:18] have a plan to graduate graduate is a
[52:20] body
[52:21] change then we got to go through the
[52:23] curriculum that set for for by God
[52:26] Almighty and he does not have books that
[52:29] we don't need I said he don't man does
[52:32] he don't we need the
[52:35] Bible and we need about 1,00 her books
[52:39] to go with that cuz that enhances the
[52:42] Bible and tells you what it says didn't
[52:44] change it prophet of God didn't come
[52:46] here to change the Bible he didn't come
[52:48] here to change the way to be a Christian
[52:51] nope New Birth was way before brother
[52:53] Brown got here her dress was way before
[52:56] brother Bown got here water baptism name
[52:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ way here before
[52:58] brother Bown got here but it had been
[53:01] lost people had got away from the plan
[53:02] they said not I'm going to that Stadium
[53:04] Baptist I'm going to that one Methodist
[53:06] I'm going to that one
[53:07] Pentecostal no you got to get back into
[53:09] one that God
[53:11] fornew would be the right one which is
[53:13] this scripture we're not going to get to
[53:15] anywhere
[53:17] today okay he knew what hour and what
[53:20] day you'd be living in he knew how much
[53:23] pressure you could stand so he puts you
[53:26] in this age to stand the pressure the
[53:30] astronaut
[53:31] pressure you know used to back in the
[53:33] 60s I remember
[53:35] 1969 when they first went to the moon in
[53:38] April I believe it was we were at the
[53:40] Big Bag Cafe up in gamesville and I know
[53:42] some of you well Joyce is not here but
[53:43] Charlotte we may have been there during
[53:45] that time um but we were watching it on
[53:47] television the TV screen was about that
[53:50] big up in the corner in the restaurant
[53:54] and it's all grainy and black and
[53:58] white not
[54:00] HD huge
[54:02] devil not HD but you know
[54:05] what there was a plan for them to get
[54:09] off the Earth whether you believe they
[54:11] went to the moon or not that's your
[54:13] business it don't matter if what I you
[54:15] think or I think if they did they did
[54:18] Brother R said if they go they'll not
[54:19] find anything so okay so way up whatever
[54:21] I don't care I'm not going to argue
[54:23] listen without controversy
[54:26] I'm not going to argue with that cuz
[54:27] there's no basis to any of it let's just
[54:30] say they did go they had to make plans
[54:33] you know how they you know how they made
[54:34] plans cuz nobody ever went up into space
[54:36] and had zero grav gravity right you know
[54:39] how they you know how they trained
[54:41] anybody know
[54:44] underwater they trained underwater they
[54:47] went underwater and it made all that
[54:48] gear lightweight it made them
[54:50] lightweight so they did all those
[54:52] Moonwalks in 20 ft of water but remember
[54:56] that was an intelligence of man what
[54:58] about the intelligence of God that
[54:59] already knew about
[55:01] pressurization then he puts you in this
[55:03] end time puts you in a message church
[55:06] and says here this is the way out of
[55:12] here and let me train
[55:14] you yes come to church read your Bible
[55:18] pray for
[55:20] people pray for each
[55:22] other so brother R says look now God
[55:25] secret mystery so now here's the secret
[55:26] mystery it's been made known cuz now as
[55:30] I see that we we say well we and we put
[55:33] a lot on on brother brandom uh being a
[55:36] prophet I understand that I agree 100%
[55:38] there's no greater man walked on the
[55:40] face of the Earth outside of Jesus
[55:41] Christ but William brandom not a man
[55:44] born of a Woman by sex was ever as great
[55:47] as brother brandham everybody with me
[55:51] all right he wasn't Jesus Christ he
[55:52] wasn't my God still ain't that's right
[55:55] and I say ain't everybody from here well
[55:57] they might know what ain't is not know
[55:58] what but I know the brief of making know
[56:00] what ain't
[56:04] is so back in the back part of God's
[56:07] mind there was something he was going to
[56:09] trying and was going to achieve so to me
[56:12] when God went when God sent the Prophet
[56:14] by
[56:15] prophetic um gift he put that Prophet
[56:18] into the mind of God which was what the
[56:20] totality of the Plan of
[56:22] Redemption everybody with me the
[56:25] totality of the Plan of Redemption the
[56:27] truth of everything predestination one
[56:29] God water baptism all these different
[56:31] things that we take for
[56:34] common told y'all the other day what we
[56:37] discuss in this building what we listen
[56:41] to on tape and and
[56:44] books take 20 people just go up in
[56:46] Gainesville and get 20 people bring them
[56:49] down here and set them down they'll be
[56:51] the most confused people in the world
[56:53] but we're here sitting going Glory
[56:55] that's exactly right that ain't nothing
[56:57] but the truth and them other 20 are
[56:59] going they're
[57:00] crazy and most of them that come in that
[57:03] ain't supposed to be here they usually
[57:04] go out that door or that door pretty
[57:05] quick right we've seen it before amen
[57:09] why because there's nothing inside to
[57:11] respond oh there's something inside to
[57:13] responds all right but it doesn't
[57:15] respond the right way but as the prophet
[57:19] of God what's your point well if brother
[57:21] Brown went back in the back part of
[57:22] God's mind listen he opened the seals
[57:24] but did he close them no he opened the
[57:28] mind of God he opened all these and we
[57:31] walked into it you and I are recipients
[57:35] of a
[57:37] prophet but not just thank God for a
[57:40] prophet now he's gone we're waiting for
[57:41] him to come back to me that's the most
[57:44] lazy people in the world lazy Christians
[57:47] waiting on waiting on somebody to come
[57:48] back I'm not even waiting on the Lord
[57:50] Jesus to come back I'm bringing him back
[57:55] he's here now I'm just waiting to
[57:57] resurrect him inside of here and you
[58:02] where's the resurrection inside of
[58:06] you prophet of God will come out of the
[58:08] ground first to be last last to be first
[58:09] he'll come out of that ground just as
[58:10] sure as I'm standing here but he will
[58:13] only come out when we come to a
[58:16] place that The Headstone in the church
[58:18] has brought Jesus Christ back to the
[58:20] Earth with no death that's through US he
[58:23] say I can't do that way I'm fixing to
[58:25] read you here in just a minute now back
[58:27] to back part of God's mind there was
[58:29] something he was trying what the plan he
[58:31] was going to plan it and what achieve it
[58:35] and he had a
[58:38] motive what's the motive to get us back
[58:42] list has been several thousand years
[58:44] since he communed with Adam in the
[58:45] garden face to face flesh to flesh human
[58:49] human human he can't do that now he has
[58:51] to work
[58:53] through a group group of people through
[58:55] your eyes through my eyes through a
[58:57] five-fold
[58:58] Ministry so he's waiting to see his
[59:00] bride like the armor meat packing gu I'm
[59:02] sure for a year he's
[59:04] like can't wait but I got to wait I told
[59:08] her I'd be back in one
[59:09] year I told i' be back one
[59:12] year and did he come back yes he did
[59:17] same way here but he had a motive in
[59:19] doing it in order to let himself be
[59:21] expressed now how is he expressed to me
[59:23] and you everybody with me so now I can't
[59:25] do
[59:28] this I can't had to come from the devil
[59:31] that didn't come from
[59:33] God 1 Corinthians 1:7 so that you come
[59:37] behind and no gift waiting for the
[59:38] coming of the Lord who shall also
[59:40] confirm
[59:42] you confirm
[59:44] you unto the end that you may be
[59:48] what read that with me I make it big so
[59:52] you older people can see it
[59:56] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
[59:58] Christ when is that day oh that'll be
[1:00:00] when we get over here and get a body
[1:00:02] changeed you better start working on it
[1:00:04] now God is faithful by whom you were
[1:00:07] called into the fellowship of his son
[1:00:08] Jesus Christ Our Lord now I beseech you
[1:00:11] brother now I compel with you brother by
[1:00:14] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that

[1:04:54] taking an ink pen and she just marks
[1:04:58] something papers flying everywhere Josh
[1:05:01] walks by he said D I stop that I
[1:05:07] said she's
[1:05:09] mine he said dad what would you done to
[1:05:11] me I said i' killed
[1:05:19] you thank God God's not a
[1:05:22] granddaddy amen don't the old grandpa
[1:05:25] everything's fine don't worry no you're
[1:05:28] he's a daddy he's a father that says hey
[1:05:31] do
[1:05:32] this because it's in the word of God do
[1:05:35] this cuz it's my will for you to do this
[1:05:39] sir get in the plan of
[1:05:41] God and not be I don't want God to be a
[1:05:45] do to your granddaddy cuz you know what
[1:05:46] that makes us lazy dilatory not diligent
[1:05:51] it makes us not Shameless not blameless
[1:05:55] but when the character of God comes in
[1:05:57] us or when he fills somebody with the
[1:05:59] Holy Ghost that's when the problems
[1:06:03] begin so the best thing for us to do is
[1:06:05] have patience we went through uh virtue
[1:06:08] virtue means strength knowledge is not
[1:06:10] the knowledge of of the world it's the
[1:06:13] knowledge of God to know that these
[1:06:14] things that I'm telling you are right or
[1:06:16] wrong something's inside of you right
[1:06:19] now right
[1:06:21] now see I I just I don't Envy brother
[1:06:24] Brandon for having
[1:06:27] discernment I don't want to know what
[1:06:28] you're thinking about me right
[1:06:31] now most of you
[1:06:33] anyway right if I could just read your
[1:06:36] mind H 10 seconds ago not now
[1:06:39] everybody's cleared the Slate
[1:06:41] today but 10 seconds ago what you were
[1:06:44] thinking about me I don't want to know
[1:06:46] but God
[1:06:48] knows but patience I mean knowledge to
[1:06:53] know that we do have discernment like
[1:06:56] dad's always said I don't need
[1:06:57] discernment I can see it on your
[1:06:59] face if I'm hitting you right between
[1:07:01] the eyes you know you got both eyes
[1:07:03] crossed you got that Furrow in your
[1:07:06] brow everybody with me so knowledge is a
[1:07:10] knowledge of God knowledge where to go
[1:07:12] knowledge what to read knowledge what to
[1:07:15] see and not see knowledge and then
[1:07:18] having Temperance not just Temperance to
[1:07:22] just let everything happen no but temp
[1:07:24] that if something does happen that thing
[1:07:26] don't rise up inside of you cuz we all
[1:07:28] got that um look at road rage road ra
[1:07:31] road
[1:07:32] rage road
[1:07:35] rage run rampant somebody kill you if
[1:07:37] you run them off the
[1:07:39] road not intentionally you know but
[1:07:41] they're going to they they'll kill you
[1:07:43] so that's the temperance of man which is
[1:07:45] nothing but the temperance of me and you
[1:07:47] is like Jesus said I forgive you for
[1:07:50] that hit him on the head Drive the nails
[1:07:52] to his hands I forgive you you for that
[1:07:55] so now we're at patience just for a
[1:07:57] moment and then we'll go to Godliness
[1:08:00] real quick and we'll have to do that
[1:08:02] this
[1:08:04] afternoon hot up here in the New
[1:08:07] Testament the the word patience is not
[1:08:09] even in the Old
[1:08:11] Testament cuz listen without the Holy
[1:08:13] Ghost you can't have Holy Ghost patience
[1:08:15] right hello
[1:08:18] somebody and they didn't have the new
[1:08:20] birth in the Old Testament there was not
[1:08:24] spiritual Rudder to make them be patient
[1:08:28] but when the New Testament comes then
[1:08:31] Jesus said I've come not just to cover
[1:08:33] you I'm going to come inside of you and
[1:08:35] then I'm going to live my patience
[1:08:38] inside of you and I'm going to live it
[1:08:40] out all
[1:08:42] right a man who has not swerve from his
[1:08:45] deliberate
[1:08:48] purpose n listen God had a plan a
[1:08:50] purpose you got to get into it when you
[1:08:51] do then you'll see the deliberate P
[1:08:53] purpose that God did these things and
[1:08:55] his loyalty to Faith and piety by even
[1:08:58] the greatest what what that's a trial
[1:09:02] says trials suffering
[1:09:05] sufferings patiently steadfastly brother
[1:09:09] R said the statute of perfect man you're
[1:09:11] beginning to reflect the works of Christ
[1:09:13] but so many of us try to do the works of
[1:09:15] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[1:09:17] is in us what about somebody pops up in
[1:09:20] 1955 and says all right we're going to
[1:09:22] the Moon just get in one of these
[1:09:23] airplanes and take
[1:09:25] off now they want to do the same thing
[1:09:28] that happened in
[1:09:29] 1969 they want to go to the
[1:09:32] moon but they're doing it the wrong way
[1:09:35] by the time they get in that airplane
[1:09:36] get about 35 or 40,000 ft up in the air
[1:09:39] gravity is going to release and they're
[1:09:41] going to
[1:09:42] die amen that's the same way brother R's
[1:09:44] talking here everybody that wants to go
[1:09:46] out and do their own thing and have
[1:09:48] something in front of the plan of God
[1:09:51] but so many of us try the works of
[1:09:53] Christ before the reflection is in
[1:09:55] us now there's the
[1:09:58] trouble now there's the
[1:10:02] trouble
[1:10:03] what there's the trouble so many of us
[1:10:06] try to do the works of Christ before the
[1:10:08] reflection of Christ is in it now
[1:10:09] there's the trouble we find those things
[1:10:12] happening you know what I know it we see
[1:10:14] these stumbles along the road we find
[1:10:16] scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians
[1:10:18] piled along the road is because they
[1:10:20] didn't go into it right he say
[1:10:22] Christians
[1:10:24] he didn't say Sinners he say
[1:10:26] Christians and that's why I'm here this
[1:10:28] morning is to try to teach this little
[1:10:30] church it's why we need teaching teach
[1:10:33] this little church and myself how that
[1:10:36] we can become the dwelling place of the
[1:10:38] Living God that should be everybody's
[1:10:41] purpose is to be the dwelling place of
[1:10:44] God this is my beloved Son and whom I'm
[1:10:47] what please to
[1:10:49] dwell we'll get to the hear you him it's
[1:10:52] it's working but but you got to be
[1:10:54] pleased to dwell first see everybody
[1:10:56] wants to jump up and be adopted and be
[1:10:58] you know be a manifested Son of God as a
[1:11:01] baby
[1:11:02] power without
[1:11:04] character is what SAT satanic but Power
[1:11:08] with character what is charact that's
[1:11:10] character that is the character that's
[1:11:12] the stature of a perfect man the Lord
[1:11:15] Jesus himself the Lord is not slack
[1:11:17] concerning his promises some men count
[1:11:19] slightness but longsuffering to us word
[1:11:22] not willing that any should perish but
[1:11:23] that all should come to repentance
[1:11:26] brother R said 1960 El Shad now God just
[1:11:31] look Abraham Abraham's what the father
[1:11:32] of our faith right and then Abraham we
[1:11:35] found out didn't obey God just right
[1:11:38] H remember God said get up and go lot
[1:11:41] got up I mean he got up and went but he
[1:11:42] took lot with him out of the will of God
[1:11:45] right there now watch now he made ready
[1:11:50] and had faith in the
[1:11:51] promise but see we can still have faith
[1:11:55] in the promise and not
[1:11:58] obey still it hinders
[1:12:01] us obey what obey what's going what what
[1:12:04] the word of God says remember what I
[1:12:07] said uh the quote that I got from
[1:12:08] brother Donnie he says you only really
[1:12:10] believe what you obey think about that
[1:12:14] you only really believe what you obey
[1:12:15] because if you don't if you don't
[1:12:17] believe it you're not going to obey
[1:12:19] it 55 miles speed Z speed limit sign if
[1:12:23] you believe that the C will make sure
[1:12:26] you
[1:12:28] do but look that doesn't do away with
[1:12:30] that
[1:12:31] sign that doesn't do away with that law
[1:12:34] well I'll just get it on for myself I'll
[1:12:36] just yeah no you're not we can still
[1:12:41] have faith in the promise and then not
[1:12:42] obey still it hinders us what did Saul
[1:12:45] do one time Saul Saul comes up and and
[1:12:48] Samuel the prophet here we go the
[1:12:50] prophet of the hour the prophet Propet
[1:12:53] of the day walks on the scene and says
[1:12:57] kill them
[1:12:59] all men women children and those two
[1:13:03] kings for sure I want them gone right
[1:13:07] through Samuel the prophet not the do
[1:13:11] old
[1:13:13] granddaddy so Saul says I'll take part
[1:13:17] of
[1:13:19] that ain't know what he said well no no
[1:13:22] brother way he didn't say that well yeah
[1:13:23] he did because he brought him back with
[1:13:25] him he didn't do what his Prophet told
[1:13:27] him to do everybody with me he didn't do
[1:13:30] what his Prophet said do he got him in
[1:13:32] tryall yes Samuel walks up and says hey
[1:13:36] what's that out here hey what's them two
[1:13:39] kings doing in
[1:13:40] prison I told you to kill them all and
[1:13:44] praise God he drugg them two kings out
[1:13:46] cut both their heads
[1:13:48] off a
[1:13:51] prophet for not obeying
[1:13:54] he said to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:13:57] oh but but brother but brother Brandon
[1:13:58] we going we going to bring all these or
[1:14:01] Samuel whatever you want to say we're
[1:14:02] going to bring all these and we're going
[1:14:03] to offer all this that's not what the
[1:14:07] prophet said the prophet God said
[1:14:09] through the prophet kill them
[1:14:11] all same way with me and you with all
[1:14:14] the demons we got to deal with now
[1:14:16] brother Brown says look patience with
[1:14:17] what what kind of patience first thing
[1:14:19] have patience with
[1:14:21] God if you got real genuine faith you'll
[1:14:24] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:14:26] worketh patience When God says anything
[1:14:29] you believe it that's all you got
[1:14:31] patience Isaiah 40: 28 but they that
[1:14:34] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:14:37] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[1:14:39] as Eagle they shall run and not be weary
[1:14:41] they shall walk and not faint somebody
[1:14:43] ought to write a song about
[1:14:45] that statue of perfect man and we should
[1:14:49] have patience with one another too yes
[1:14:51] sir like I've tried to get this message
[1:14:53] over to the Tabernacle to see that each
[1:14:55] member of the Tabernacle look becomes
[1:14:57] this I'm sure he's pointing at
[1:15:00] that it's hard to do I've tried to have
[1:15:05] patience now watch he's a
[1:15:08] prophet they know to a degree he's a
[1:15:11] prophet because of his
[1:15:14] discernment but what are they doing
[1:15:16] about it brother Brown said you read it
[1:15:19] you can read it behind me how many times
[1:15:22] has he preached on women cutting their
[1:15:24] hair painting their
[1:15:26] face how many times we preach to y'all

[1:21:42] God Matthew 10:22 say you shall be hated
[1:21:46] of all men for my name's sake but he

[1:22:05] don't run away from
[1:22:08] it run toward

[1:23:17] with the bride come on somebody cuz
[1:23:19] we're going to talk about anointed ones
[1:23:21] they're going to attack theirself to the
[1:23:23] bride and you're not going to be able to
[1:23:24] tell the difference except a
[1:23:26] revelation of the son of man you
[1:23:30] cannot you say prove it okay there was
[1:23:33] 12 people sitting at a table everybody
[1:23:36] with me there was 12 people sitting at
[1:23:38] the table with
[1:23:40] Jesus Jesus starts telling them he
[1:23:43] stands up he's the what he's not the Son
[1:23:44] of God at that moment he's the son of
[1:23:46] man he's God in human flesh he's the son
[1:23:48] of God in a man so that makes him the
[1:23:51] son of man all right so the son of man
[1:23:54] is sitting at a table and and listen
[1:23:56] supposedly now listen listen to me real
[1:23:59] real real close supposedly those are his
[1:24:01] 12
[1:24:02] disciples that believe what he
[1:24:05] says and does what he says that's what a
[1:24:08] discipled
[1:24:09] does they weren't that yet they weren't
[1:24:12] there they didn't have the Holy Ghost so
[1:24:15] they were wondering well who's the best
[1:24:16] in the Kingdom who this what are you
[1:24:18] going to do when you get back do we have
[1:24:19] to do this do we have to do that Lord
[1:24:21] who's this person
[1:24:23] that's going to betray
[1:24:26] you he said the
[1:24:28] one that puts
[1:24:31] their thing in the bowl which would be
[1:24:34] the bread in the bowl and and probably
[1:24:35] soop up a little gravy said that's the
[1:24:38] one that's going to betray me and the
[1:24:39] Bible says Judas did it and they
[1:24:43] still didn't know what he was doing but
[1:24:47] one man did the son of man knew he was
[1:24:50] fixing to be betrayed all them other 11
[1:24:53] had no
[1:24:54] clue the religious part of the church at
[1:24:57] the time but now on the day of Pentecost
[1:25:00] when the Holy Ghost came remember Paul
[1:25:01] Peter stands up and he tells about the
[1:25:03] one about the one that betrayed Jesus
[1:25:05] They Knew What Judas was had done then
[1:25:07] but when they were sitting at that
[1:25:10] table cuz Judas had a form of
[1:25:13] godliness and he was so close till they
[1:25:16] could not tell cuz the Bible says it
[1:25:19] could deceive the very elect if it were
[1:25:21] possible that's what we're heading
[1:25:23] toward that's what we're looking at
[1:25:25] let's sing a song God bless you thank
[1:25:27] you for being
[1:25:30] attentive that will
[1:25:33] be when my
