Description:
ROMANS 8:30-39
»     30     †     Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
»     31     †      ¶  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 
»     32     †     He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 
»     33     †     Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. 
»     34     †     Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 
»     35     †     Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 
»     36     †     As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 
»     37     †     Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 
»     38     †     For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
»     39     †     Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

but it was so real to me what I got sir and how I get it and it's so precious until I'm still holding on to it and I would say in my heart God what happened to my black friends what happened to my people and I believe Paul thinks about that but when he read Romans 11 amen am and I prayed that someday this wonderful message would reach their heart amen and it wasn't too long amen I could see my colored friends Jamaica we don't say colored we say black black is beautiful and so first time I went to South Carolina and the Revival for the black people start around there I was so happy amen

fullness amen will bring the Rapture exactly right is that right amen glory he get it in the fullness we get little by little on little byad little church Glory we belong to that same family amen that's right I want to be long have the I would like to put it here a little knowledge of the royal family I work with Princess Alice great granddaughter of Queen Victoria host of to is working at the guest house whenever she's on the island right she would come so I know a little of that Royal thing right when she is coming right she used to be at the um university of the West Indies she come each here for the great radiation and she finish off that part then she comes down to the house she will stay two or three months all royal families is like this there were questions and questions some brother talked to me about how did Brother Bram get to the Palace they can't find it in know history and things like that but God know how to do it am my wife and myself we work there right and so I could tell a little of what I see or what I learn even how get there but brand was going to England and it spreads around right and if you read B told about it when this granddaughter of the nurse there in um South Africa what's your name again somebody yeah great granddaughter and you'll see see her in the book and things like that right well they heard brother BR was going to to England for a meeting and on the way they try to get her to England to be prayed for and the story starts like that there is a man from Canada lives in Ireland re race horses that's the part of it okay and uh he buys race horses for the queen Queen have a lot of resources and so forth and that man would come yearly also to stay in the house for a month or so and this one that works for the queen in England right he was sent to the what you call it Derby he here down there that's where you get your best arst to buy and things like that so he's supposed to go down there and by house is for the queen and so he stopped by maybe they don't know that and the same man would stop at the house where this man from Ireland he's from Canada he lives there yeah and would buy race horses also so he sto for two or 3 days and he would shoot there okay if you follow me a little bit and so that's how it comes up right so he knew somebody in um Texas right and they were talking how the king is sick and in bed and some are the other it starts right there and you know and I know the English people don't believe in the American religion okay they mock the preachers and things like that but somehow they were just talking right so he met with that one down there right and he was just talking and the one in Texas I found it in my wife's diary cuz she get everything written down I didn't even know it just after dead I was just going through some her diary and I saw the old thing she wrote out right and that's how it starts okay and the man was just telling him that's the Queens right trainer said man they could only get that man named William brand right and he was just boasting about William brandham he's a preacher he's a Healer things like that and I'm sure he could pray for that kinging jorgia 6 and God will do something for him so anyway the word get back when he called me out and things like that I put one of brother Bam's life story book in the in their library in the house right so my wife when went all over she said I'm going to ask her if she knew about it and I was standing right there when she asked the princess if anything went like that he said oh yeah oh yeah but it's not published yeah you say on the way right they told Brother brandom when the P plane landed was Tak him straight to the p yeah so the plane landed but brah don't even know about it you understand me and things like that so when the plane landed they took him straight to the Palace he was in bed and he prayed for the King right secret prayor or maybe the way they kept it but it was not published and he went and he play his game po right God healed him that's how he get to go to the Palace to fulfill what God told him right he would pray for kings potentate and if you I'm sure you read the book right had the opportunity to go to Rome and see the pope and they all lined up oh yeah and they came and said well when your time come you'll have to kiss his ring and you'll have to kiss the ring on his toe and maybe this is the only preacher said no all the rest kiss his ring and kiss his ring on his toe but Ram said I would not bow down to a man said I've got one to bow down too and that's Jesus [Music] Christ so he didn't get to go in he step aside yeah but he could have gone in like any other preacher if he would just decide can you they got to tell you what you have to do right when the princess is at the home where I work and things like that one day a car drove up was in my uniform tunic and everything Crown buttons and things and the car stop little bit he drove up he said could I see the princess cuz they got to go through me there's police around too but I'm the but there right so I went to the top secretary or secretary I said there's a principal here from ask school would like to talk to the princess she said go and to him and tell to tell you right the matter give you the matter I went three times I said sir if you just tell don't tell me all of just tell me that I can take this to the secretary and the secretary take it and he said no no no I can't tell you and I went back to the top secretary I said he said he won't tell me he said he just want to tell it to the princess three times went back the last time she went told the princess the princess said no if he cannot tell me what he wants right right because I got to take it to the secretary I it's not me going to tell the princess but I had to tell the secretary and the secretary and he said no he said well tell him he'll never see the princess and he didn't see either and if the man would just only said well I'm a principal I'm having a something in the school and I like H that's all he couldn't say and he had to just reverse and go back so that is why you know in the message they try to get every little details and every little details so preacher was talking to me and I smile I said I'm a living evidence that's right that's right bu that he went there right that's right I said I put his life story book yeah in the shelf right there in the home right I I said my wife ask her and she smile and she give the full story right am and my my wife wrote it down I want to said Church you
