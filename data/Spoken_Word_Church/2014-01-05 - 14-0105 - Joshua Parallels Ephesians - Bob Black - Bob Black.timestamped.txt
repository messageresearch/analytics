[1:02] and then we're gonna go look at
[1:03] ephesians

[1:08] got three inches and it's climbing and
[1:09] they gotta drive through that
[1:52] they went up to colorado springs their
[1:54] grandma
[1:55] yeah because that was her son you know
[1:58] my grandmother got run over by a
[1:59] reindeer
[2:02] i'd have got out there yesterday no it's
[2:04] so grounding
[2:07] so um by the way he wanted to put in a
[2:09] prayer request i told brother terrance
[2:11] to pray so let's let's pray before we
[2:13] read our scriptures real quick
[2:14] lord we thank you god for this day lord
[2:17] another day to serve you another year
[2:18] that you brought us through lord we
[2:20] thank you god for opening your word to
[2:22] us lord jesus
[2:24] god granted i pray that as our brothers
[2:26] and sisters travel or that you'll just
[2:28] be with them and watch them on the road

[2:32] jesus let your angel of mercy just guide
[2:34] them safely safely and sound lord to
[2:36] their destination lord i pray god that

[2:46] in grace and knowledge even more lord
[2:48] that you'll just be with us and make
[2:50] yourself manifest and known to us lord
[2:52] we pray in the name of the lord jesus
[2:53] christ
[2:54] amen
[2:57] now um
[2:59] last time we were talking about
[3:02] how joshua and ephesians compare one to
[3:06] another because they're both talking
[3:08] about
[3:09] the the placing the placing of
[3:11] of christians how you come you you're
[3:14] filled with the holy ghost and joshua
[3:15] types of the believer that's
[3:17] crossed over the river jordan and
[3:19] they're led by the holy ghost and to be
[3:22] placed into their inheritance so i um
[3:25] you can kind of as you read the book of
[3:27] ephesians you can see in there that paul
[3:30] is talking about a journey of a believer
[3:32] that begins when you are filled with a
[3:34] holy ghost and a lot of people um
[3:37] when you talk to people they
[3:39] i i feel like a lot of people mis miss
[3:42] that when you get the baptism of the
[3:43] holy ghost
[3:45] when you're born again
[3:46] that there's more to come that you're
[3:48] growing and grace and knowledge you
[3:50] don't automatically have
[3:52] every you know you haven't already
[3:54] defeated all of the anakins all of the
[3:57] amalekites all the gergeshots all of the
[4:00] uh the the
[4:03] uh problems in the flesh that were tied
[4:06] right there in joshua
[4:08] so i wanted this morning to read in luke
[4:10] chapter 2
[4:11] verse 52.
[4:15] just kind of start off
[4:21] and jesus increased in wisdom and
[4:23] stature
[4:24] and in favor with god and man
[4:27] that's kind of a strange that's a maybe
[4:29] a hard thing to wrap our minds around
[4:31] that jesus increased
[4:33] increase in wisdom and stature now take
[4:35] it all the way back to when he was a
[4:36] little baby as a little baby he didn't
[4:38] he had no understanding his little baby
[4:40] of what he was sent for and maybe take
[4:42] it a year forward
[4:44] maybe he maybe still just a one-year-old
[4:47] year old little baby running around and
[4:49] in a diaper or whatever they did back
[4:51] there had no understanding as he as each
[4:54] year grew by went by you know then god
[4:56] will begin to speak to him and he'll
[4:58] begin to
[4:59] understand more and more about what his
[5:01] purpose was so even jesus
[5:04] uh the fullness of the godhead bodily
[5:06] that all of these scriptures wrapped up
[5:09] and bottled up like brother brown said
[5:10] bottled up into one man
[5:12] grew
[5:13] in grace and knowledge
[5:16] in wisdom and stature and that's what
[5:18] we're talking about we're growing into
[5:20] the stature into his stature the statue
[5:23] of a perfect man because the only
[5:25] perfect man is christ jesus we're
[5:27] growing up into the statue of a perfect
[5:29] man that where he can be made manifest
[5:31] in us
[5:32] and in favor with god a man and look
[5:35] what he was doing
[5:36] before right before the scripture was uh
[5:40] we read this scripture about what he was
[5:41] doing just before that was he was
[5:43] sitting in the temple
[5:45] and under solomon's porch probably or
[5:47] wherever and uh
[5:49] listening
[5:50] to the to the priests
[5:53] you know speak about the the word the
[5:55] scribes and the pharisees and the ones
[5:57] they were teaching and that's how we
[5:59] grow
[6:01] a lot of times we uh you know we hinder
[6:03] our growth because we don't we don't put
[6:06] enough time into the father's business
[6:08] like what jesus he said i must be about
[6:10] my father's business
[6:12] the father's business is to
[6:15] in our life i believe is to study and
[6:18] read and pray and dedicate our life and
[6:21] you know over in in uh ephesians paul
[6:24] talked about how we are now in heavenly
[6:26] places
[6:27] when those heavenly places
[6:29] are
[6:30] the sphere a higher sphere of lifting
[6:33] ourself up and by devoting our life to
[6:35] god by uh you know making time to pray
[6:38] and read and and study lifting ourselves
[6:40] up into a higher realm where god can
[6:43] fellowship with us and heavenly the
[6:45] heavenly place that paul talked about in
[6:47] ephesians
[6:48] the parallels the canaan land that
[6:50] joshua uh the which types the holy holy
[6:53] oath led the children of israel into
[6:56] that uh everything everywhere they
[6:58] looked they could it was their
[6:59] inheritance their possession and these
[7:01] heavenly places the things that are in
[7:03] these heavenly places uh god in this
[7:05] pace
[7:07] excuse me patience temperance knowledge
[7:09] and and not just in the statute of a
[7:11] perfect man but healing for our body and
[7:14] and uh
[7:17] the walk of a christian life uh
[7:19] mortifying the flesh as paul said all of
[7:21] these things are are in part of the
[7:24] heavenly place and
[7:26] um
[7:27] so last time we were talking about how
[7:29] um
[7:31] how
[7:32] what what god did on the cross with this
[7:34] the brass serpent remember we talked
[7:37] about how the fiery serpents came out
[7:39] and and that he uh
[7:41] fired serpents from biting people and
[7:44] moses typed in in the old testament that
[7:47] he lifted up that brass serpent which
[7:49] types what christ did on the cross by
[7:51] becoming judgment being judged for us so
[7:54] that we wouldn't have to face
[7:56] judgment for we wouldn't have to um
[7:59] he did what we could not do
[8:01] by
[8:02] taking on all of our sin every
[8:05] everything that
[8:06] had been held account
[8:08] put to our charge in the garden of eden
[8:11] and uh
[8:12] just the
[8:13] sand and and so forth and then we looked
[8:16] at how
[8:21] the story of arthur neal and axa which
[8:23] was uh you know
[8:25] josh will let the children of israel
[8:26] over into canaan's land and and he told
[8:29] every
[8:30] joshua types the holy ghost putting
[8:32] everyone into their inheritance and he
[8:34] told each one where their part of the
[8:36] inheritance was and he put caleb in in
[8:40] hebron
[8:40] and and then he caleb gay uh he told uh
[8:44] austin neal if you'll go take this city
[8:46] cage's safer courageous safer than uh
[8:49] the city of the book then you can have
[8:51] this wife and and that times christ
[8:54] going and taking dying for our sins and
[8:56] taking the book
[8:58] to win back a wife
[9:00] and
[9:02] you know brother brown talked about how
[9:05] um
[9:06] when he when when when christ died on
[9:09] the cross
[9:10] remember we're talking about joshua and
[9:12] ephesians typing the believer claiming
[9:15] their inheritance or
[9:17] that or
[9:18] because god gave it to you on the cross
[9:21] there it is and joshua they they crossed
[9:23] over the river door and there it was
[9:25] laid before them all their inheritance
[9:27] they just had to go to go claim it to go
[9:30] i believe it god has given it to me
[9:33] and that's what i believe we're doing as
[9:35] we journey of the statute for of a
[9:37] perfect man as uh i was talking to the
[9:39] stat about the statue of perfect man to
[9:40] somebody and they they said uh well it
[9:43] sounds like what you're saying is is
[9:44] that you're talking about works that
[9:46] you've got to you like pressures like
[9:49] try to do something all the way up the
[9:50] statue of perfect man
[9:52] but
[9:52] you know what in in
[9:54] canaan's land
[9:55] they weren't
[9:57] uh
[9:58] who fought the battle
[10:00] you know uh
[10:01] i was listening to brother brown talk
[10:02] about how when they
[10:04] when they uh began to fight their
[10:06] battles and and just you know the first
[10:08] when they can uh took the babylonian
[10:11] garment of gold he just a few it was
[10:14] just a handful of people that died but
[10:16] joshua fell on his face and and uh
[10:19] something's wrong because we're not
[10:22] fighting the battle god is fighting
[10:23] battle if anybody dies at all
[10:26] something's wrong because this you know
[10:28] we they were carrying the swords and
[10:29] they were running in into battle with
[10:31] their shields but it was god that was
[10:34] fighting the battle that was
[10:35] all down through the old testament to
[10:37] get in and uh you know all the different
[10:39] things that happened to the old
[10:40] testament warriors of faith
[10:43] like a samson that could kill a thousand
[10:45] philistines with an old uh
[10:49] soggy jawbone you know just that was
[10:51] half rotted that's that was a samson
[10:53] doing that
[10:54] that was a almighty god the power of god
[10:57] being manifest in his life that's not
[10:59] that we're we're fighting this battle to
[11:02] destroy the amalekites in our flesh but
[11:04] it's god doing work in us we have to
[11:06] allow him to do that
[11:08] by mortifying our flesh as paul said
[11:11] letting ourself laying our life down so
[11:13] that he can work out his uh his fulfill
[11:17] his word in us
[11:20] and um
[11:21] bill abraham talked about how this
[11:22] inheritance is when he died on the cross
[11:24] he didn't he didn't leave an inheritance
[11:26] it was always written in him before the
[11:28] foundation of the world not uh sometimes
[11:31] when we think about an inheritance that
[11:33] we think about earthly possessions that
[11:35] when somebody dies they're going to
[11:36] leave you stuff
[11:38] and but this
[11:39] maybe look at a little bit different
[11:41] when christ
[11:42] because in him was written all of these
[11:44] attributes all these qualities about
[11:46] himself that had to be made manifest and
[11:48] you know broadband talked about in
[11:50] genesis that there was all these
[11:51] attributes that he wanted to fellowship
[11:53] with and so out of him came a little
[11:55] part of himself designated
[11:58] so that he could fellowship with you
[11:59] know a part of him called a
[12:02] you know genesis 1 26 27 and he began to
[12:05] make himself manifest and and so that he
[12:08] could god and his family and
[12:11] all these attributes be being made
[12:13] manifest love joy peace long suffering
[12:16] temperance goodness meekness and all of
[12:19] these things that himself
[12:21] are our inheritance and if you can't
[12:22] make him manifest and now he's making
[12:24] them made manifest in us and we looked
[12:27] at in the that old testament story of
[12:29] arthur neal and axa how axa
[12:31] her name is the unveiling the unveiling
[12:34] of god and god is unveiling himself and
[12:36] his people today
[12:39] and so um
[12:42] brother graham also talked about it and
[12:44] we'll look
[12:45] in a second we'll kind of start going
[12:47] through ephesians
[12:48] let's see how some of these types play
[12:50] out in ephesians but your inheritance is
[12:53] israel graham said your inheritance is
[12:55] weighty in the city of jerusalem until
[12:57] you're endued with power from on high
[12:59] because your inheritance begins
[13:02] with the new birth and
[13:04] you know
[13:07] we were listening to the token this
[13:08] morning driving to church and and
[13:10] brother brown just kept he spent so much
[13:12] time talking about having the old
[13:14] testament they when they offered that
[13:15] old testament sacrifice there was that
[13:17] life there was
[13:19] an animal doesn't have a soul there's no
[13:21] there's no way for that life to come
[13:23] back
[13:24] on a believer and make them live the way
[13:27] that they should but now with that with
[13:29] this perfect sacrifice that brass
[13:31] serpent that was offered up for us that
[13:33] life can come back and live in the
[13:35] believer
[13:36] and that
[13:37] all wrapped up in that when he when he
[13:40] when that token comes and lives inside
[13:41] of you then wrapped up in there is the
[13:43] attributes that could be made manifest
[13:45] and you your inheritance that land of
[13:47] canaan that the believers were taking
[13:50] taking over by faith
[13:52] now
[13:53] remember uh uh they didn't get that
[13:56] inheritance
[13:57] just because god gave it to moses
[14:00] they didn't get any inheritance because
[14:02] god gave it to
[14:03] to uh joshua they got it because he had
[14:06] promised it to abraham
[14:10] how many hundreds of years before
[14:12] by faith by grace through faith and
[14:15] that's how we get the inheritance in him
[14:17] is by it's by faith by his grace to us
[14:20] by our believing it and they they
[14:22] believe that promise that had been
[14:24] promised to abraham and that's how they
[14:26] were able to take over now what if um
[14:30] uh oh what if uh you know
[14:33] that god had promised that promise to
[14:35] abraham and he and that promise had
[14:37] journeyed now that they they
[14:39] you know they all had that confession we
[14:41] serve the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[14:45] because that's the god that they knew
[14:47] had made these promises to them and they
[14:48] were
[14:49] they were
[14:50] in that nation of israel that served
[14:52] that that one true living god and they
[14:55] when they crossed over jordan they knew
[14:57] that that the god that promised to
[14:59] abraham
[15:00] that
[15:01] that this land was theirs was was able
[15:04] to fight their battles and so uh
[15:06] what if and when he told caleb to go
[15:09] take this hebron from the giants what if
[15:11] caleb said well i just can't do it you
[15:14] know you know
[15:15] that that story already played out when
[15:17] they got the cash barnette when uh
[15:19] most of the spies said well we can't do
[15:21] it but caleb he went over he'd already
[15:24] seen canaan and he said i i know they're
[15:26] disabled i know my god is able to to do
[15:29] it and you know look at this uh stature
[15:32] i'm kind of uh moving into tying into
[15:35] kind of brother wade's territory a
[15:36] little bit but the statue of a perfect
[15:38] man is is that that canaan's land that i
[15:41] know god is able to to deliver it
[15:44] and to fulfill it in my life to give it
[15:47] to me that even though there's giants
[15:49] then in in canaan there were seven
[15:51] different uh the gergis shines the
[15:53] malachites the
[15:54] all the different seven different
[15:56] foreign tribes and each one was far more
[15:59] powerful than any of them
[16:01] there was no way that they could take
[16:03] the land just by their buy their own
[16:05] uh
[16:06] you know their own carnal
[16:08] taking up the sword and swinging it and
[16:10] there's no way that we could take
[16:12] there's no way that in myself that i
[16:13] could be godly or patient or uh
[16:16] temperate but
[16:17] by the token by that new birth then it
[16:20] it
[16:21] he made it possible
[16:23] so um
[16:24] we got about 15 minutes
[16:27] let me uh let's turn over to ephesians
[16:32] and we'll just kind of
[16:36] i thought i'd have a little bit more
[16:38] time
[16:39] i got a little bit wordy i'm sorry
[16:48] ephesians
[16:59] i'm going to skip around a little bit so
[17:01] we'll start a hebrew ephesians 1 and
[17:03] just kind of go through the whole the
[17:04] whole book um
[17:06] maybe quickly
[17:08] um so look look who this this this book
[17:10] is being written to now
[17:12] the little church's emphasis was started
[17:14] by paul and apollos and and cool and
[17:16] priscilla and paul stayed there three
[17:18] months when he's when he started the
[17:19] church when he left and then the next
[17:21] year the beginning of the next year he
[17:22] came back and spent three years there i
[17:25] believe it's three years and so that
[17:27] this you know brother i'm talking about
[17:28] this was just a little group of people
[17:30] but they were strong they were fortified
[17:32] they they were like the children of
[17:34] israel that crossed the jordan river
[17:36] that had been come to a place where they
[17:38] knew the god that they served they had
[17:40] knowledge that he was the same yesterday
[17:42] today and forever
[17:43] and they knew that he was more than able
[17:45] to fight their battles and that's that's
[17:46] the kind of people that paul was writing
[17:48] this book to
[17:49] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[17:51] will of god to the saints which are at
[17:53] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[17:55] jesus
[17:56] grace be to you in peace from god our
[17:58] father and from the lord jesus christ
[18:00] blessed be the god and father of our
[18:02] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[18:03] with all spiritual blessings
[18:05] in heavenly places in christ
[18:08] and heavenly places now now that's what
[18:10] i'm talking about it paul says he uses
[18:12] the phrase heavenly or heavenly places
[18:14] five times in his book but he's because
[18:16] he's typing that he's drawing on that
[18:20] that canaan land experience that they
[18:22] have crossed over jordan into heavenly
[18:25] places and now they have set before with
[18:27] them all the the inheritance that god
[18:29] has laid out before them and all they
[18:31] have to do is like like that table that
[18:32] brother i'm talking about all the you
[18:34] know if you need healing just reach out
[18:35] and grab it and claim it and say lord i
[18:37] this is what you have promised and if
[18:40] there's any aikens in my life let me
[18:42] destroy them let me lay them down on the
[18:44] altar of your sacrifice and let and and
[18:46] you just take it out of my life so that
[18:49] all of your promises can be made
[18:50] manifest
[18:52] because he promised it if if he promised
[18:54] it and something is not being fulfilled
[18:57] and there's something wrong there's
[18:58] something wrong somewhere because he
[19:00] promised it
[19:02] now now that's how they looked at in the
[19:04] old testament and i believe that's how
[19:06] we've got to look at it too
[19:12] according as he had chosen us in him
[19:13] before the foundation of the world that
[19:15] we should be holy and without blame
[19:16] before him in love having predestinated
[19:19] us unto the adoption of children by
[19:21] jesus christ himself according to the
[19:23] good pleasure of his will predestinated
[19:26] us into the adoption because in in the
[19:28] old canaan land they were predestinated
[19:30] they were called out chosen people
[19:32] predestinated you remember last time we
[19:34] were talking about how the um the
[19:37] their mamas had prophesied as they gave
[19:40] she gave birth where they were gonna
[19:43] where they were gonna be placed in that
[19:44] land
[19:45] and uh hundreds of years later joshua by
[19:48] the spirit of the lord put them exactly
[19:50] according to that prophecy because it
[19:52] was predestinated god had put them had
[19:54] an ordinary place for them to to be
[19:57] placed and
[19:59] and that's how the believer is in christ
[20:01] god will and remember this book of
[20:03] ephesians places the church he talks
[20:05] about husbands and wives and how masters
[20:08] are supposed to treat servants and how
[20:11] of apostles and prophets and teachers
[20:13] and how everybody in the church is
[20:15] supposed to treat one another and your
[20:16] place and and he puts everybody the
[20:19] spirit of god is putting everybody in
[20:21] place just like
[20:22] in the old testament with joshua in whom
[20:25] we also have it let's see where am i
[20:26] going
[20:33] i'm going to skip around a second
[20:35] all right let's get down to verse 10.
[20:37] so that i i believe you can read
[20:41] in ephesians paul begins to talk about
[20:44] building a body
[20:46] building a church and he you know
[20:48] brother branham used any preacher statue
[20:50] of a perfect man he used scripture from
[20:52] ephesians because paul is talking about
[20:54] once you are born again
[20:56] then you begin to grow in grace and
[20:59] knowledge just like jesus growing grace
[21:02] because he's he's building something
[21:03] he's building a church down through
[21:05] seven church ages he was building a
[21:06] church and in your own personal life
[21:09] he's building you up in the stature of a
[21:12] perfect man of the image of christ and
[21:14] when that building is completed
[21:19] let me find that quote
[21:22] when the building is completed
[21:27] there it is
[21:28] statue of a perfect man paragraph 451
[21:30] add to your faith virtue add your virtue
[21:32] knowledge to your knowledge temperance
[21:34] to your tempers patience to your
[21:35] patients godless to your godless
[21:37] brotherly love to your brother love the
[21:38] holy spirit
[21:40] and christ will come
[21:42] christ will come when the building is
[21:43] completed
[21:48] oh man there's so many that
[21:51] you know the coming of the lord is the
[21:52] revealing of his word
[21:54] he's uh
[21:56] well i'm gonna get off but um so let's
[22:02] so
[22:03] we were looking at uh verse 10
[22:05] chapter one verse ten that in the
[22:06] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[22:08] might gather together and one all things
[22:10] in christ
[22:11] both which are in heaven heaven and
[22:13] which are on earth even in him and whom
[22:15] also we have obtained an inheritance
[22:17] we've obtained it in him by being part
[22:19] of him being predestinated according to
[22:21] the purpose of him who worketh all
[22:23] things after the council of his own will
[22:25] that we should be to the praise of his
[22:27] glory who first first trusted in christ
[22:30] and whom he also trusted after that he
[22:32] heard the word of truth
[22:33] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[22:36] after that he believed you were sealed
[22:38] with that holy spirit of promised which
[22:41] is the earnest of our inheritance now
[22:43] crossing the river is the earnest
[22:46] and i keep stressing that because i that
[22:48] that's a difficult thing
[22:50] to realize that there's more to come
[22:53] after you receive the holy ghost lay
[22:55] yourself down
[22:56] on the altar of god's sacrifice so that
[22:58] god can
[22:59] can give you
[23:01] your full inheritance and full
[23:03] redemption full inheritance
[23:05] is the body change and that's what we're
[23:07] working for
[23:08] full inheritance full redemption
[23:11] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[23:13] until the redemption of the purchased
[23:15] possession under the praise of his glory
[23:19] ah let's go to
[23:23] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1.
[23:26] and you have to quicken
[23:29] who are dead and trespasses and sins
[23:32] i keep stressing this because he's
[23:33] talking to a people he's talking about a
[23:35] road and a journey and building and all
[23:38] these different things building up a
[23:39] body because
[23:41] and here he's talk the people that he's
[23:43] talking to are the ones that are
[23:44] quickened they have been quick and
[23:46] they've been filled the holy ghost now
[23:48] this is the scriptural proof to in the
[23:50] statute of perfect man how i've got a
[23:53] list of quotes i was going to read about
[23:55] how the the statue of a perfect man is a
[23:57] requirement
[23:58] is something that is part of god
[24:00] requires and it begins at the new birth
[24:02] the foundation and this is
[24:04] this is the scriptural proof for that
[24:06] you have to quicken who were dead in
[24:08] trespasses and sins and uh
[24:12] and and go down to verse six and have
[24:14] raised us up together and made us sit
[24:17] together there's heavenly places again
[24:19] in heavenly places you're in canaan's
[24:21] fair and happy land
[24:23] that in the ages to come he might show
[24:24] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[24:26] his kindness toward us through christ
[24:28] jesus
[24:29] for by grace
[24:31] are ye saved through faith that's how
[24:33] they got canaan's land because abraham
[24:35] had promised it
[24:37] uh god had promised it to abraham and
[24:39] abraham believed it by faith that
[24:41] everywhere you defeat your feet walk
[24:43] this land is giving you everywhere you
[24:45] can see this is your this is your
[24:47] inheritance for by grace are ye saved
[24:50] through faith is that not of yourselves
[24:52] it is the gift of god
[24:54] not a works because they all they could
[24:56] do was put take up that jawbone of an
[24:59] ass or their
[25:00] spear or their their sword and and just
[25:03] trust the lord that he would put it
[25:05] where it was supposed to go
[25:06] not of works unless any man should boast
[25:09] for we are his workmanship created in
[25:11] christ jesus and the good works which
[25:13] god has before ordained that we should
[25:15] walk in them
[25:18] let me see what else i had
[25:21] let's go to
[25:27] chapter 2 verse 20.
[25:29] now here he starts talking about the
[25:31] building
[25:33] let's start at 19. now therefore you are
[25:34] no more strangers and foreigners but
[25:36] fellow citizens with the saints and of
[25:37] the household of god and are built upon
[25:39] the foundation of the apostles and
[25:41] prophets jesus christ himself being the
[25:43] chief cornerstone and whom all the
[25:46] building fitly framed together groweth
[25:48] unto a holy temple in the lord
[25:51] in whom ye also
[25:53] are building see now there's
[25:55] there's the
[25:56] the whole church the whole building down
[25:59] through seven church ages is building a
[26:00] big building with every all the
[26:02] believers and then inside of that
[26:04] individually the believers are growing
[26:06] into a statue of a perfect man in whom
[26:09] we also are building together for
[26:10] inhabitation of god through the spirit
[26:12] the church
[26:14] and the individual
[26:17] for what purpose let's go down to
[26:20] verse chapter 3
[26:22] verse 9.
[26:25] to make all men see what is the
[26:27] fellowship of this mystery
[26:29] now
[26:30] remember what the purpose of those
[26:33] believers going into canaan's land when
[26:36] they crossed over jordan river remember
[26:37] they were looking out across the uh
[26:40] from jericho and they were began to
[26:42] tremble that was rahab's testimony that
[26:45] everybody would tremble when they saw
[26:47] you the pillar of fire leaving you and
[26:49] you come across the water just parks and
[26:51] here you come so they were a testimony
[26:54] to make all men see was the fellowship
[26:56] of the mystery to make everyone
[26:59] to when they looked upon them and saw
[27:01] the power of living god and they
[27:02] manifested the people then they uh it it
[27:06] was a revelation to the nations that god
[27:09] was alive that he's still alive and well
[27:11] i think he's alive and his people
[27:13] and
[27:14] that's
[27:15] it's just beautiful how these two
[27:16] compare one one to another and to make
[27:19] all men see what is the fellowship of
[27:20] the mystery which from the beginning
[27:23] of the world have been hidden god who
[27:25] created all things by jesus christ to
[27:28] the intent that now unto the
[27:29] principalities and powers in heavenly
[27:31] places
[27:32] might be known by the church the
[27:35] manifold wisdom of god now that
[27:37] believers are in heavenly places there's
[27:39] heavenly places again making known to
[27:42] the world
[27:43] by you know
[27:45] god revealing himself and in the of a
[27:47] perfect man to his people
[27:49] now
[27:52] let's let's compare
[27:54] uh that scripture to the to the intent
[27:56] that now to the principalities and
[27:57] powers in heavenly places might be known
[27:59] compare that let's jump over to chapter
[28:01] 6
[28:03] verse 12.
[28:09] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[28:11] blood
[28:12] but against principalities
[28:14] against powers against the rulers of the
[28:17] darkness of this world against spiritual
[28:19] weakness in high places
[28:21] and i'm going to finish on that because
[28:23] i'm about to run out of time now now in
[28:25] the old now this this is just so
[28:26] beautiful
[28:27] he's talking about in the old testament
[28:30] they they fought their battles with us
[28:31] with a sword they picked up a sword and
[28:33] they cut down you know we talked about
[28:35] those three giants that you know typed
[28:37] that the
[28:39] the trinity and how caleb and often went
[28:42] through there and just slew slowed down
[28:43] because they were restoring into that
[28:44] land the belief in just one god
[28:47] and and
[28:49] so they wrestled with with giants so
[28:51] they could see
[28:52] uh big old huge guys but now we wrestle
[28:55] on our knees down on our knees but
[28:57] asking god to help us and and
[29:00] you know you
[29:02] when you begin to pray for somebody
[29:03] that's lost or
[29:07] you your kids or whatever
[29:09] then that's fighting something that's
[29:12] maybe even a greater fight than was
[29:14] fought in the old testament so now let's
[29:16] let's just read on down for we and
[29:19] remember we're talking about
[29:20] building and fighting and overcoming
[29:23] taking your inheritance in the old
[29:25] testament joshua they fought with the
[29:27] knife now look how we fight when we
[29:29] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[29:30] against principalities against powers
[29:32] against the rulers of the darkness of
[29:33] this world against spiritual wickedness
[29:36] in high places
[29:37] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[29:39] of god that you may be able to withstand
[29:41] in the evil day and having done all
[29:43] to stand
[29:45] stand therefore having you will learn
[29:47] loans gird about with truth
[29:49] and having on the breastplate of
[29:50] righteousness
[29:52] and your feet shod with the preparation
[29:53] of the gospel of peace
[29:56] above all
[29:57] taking the shield of faith
[29:59] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[30:01] the fire and darks of the wicked and
[30:04] take the helmet of salvation and the
[30:05] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[30:08] god
[30:09] praying always with all prayer and
[30:12] supplication in the spirit and watching
[30:14] there unto you with all perseverance and
[30:16] supplication for all saints now all
[30:19] these pieces of the armor of the full
[30:21] armor
[30:23] of god
[30:24] are
[30:26] you know
[30:27] girl about with truth
[30:29] you gotta study a little bit you gotta
[30:31] read take some time and read a little
[30:33] bit before you even know how have an
[30:36] inkling of what truth is
[30:38] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[30:40] of peace be ready to give an account for
[30:42] what you believe
[30:44] above all taking the shield of faith and
[30:47] all these things is not so that you can
[30:50] fight but so that he can fight for you
[30:52] and so you can believe and trust him so
[30:54] let's just stop
