TRANSCRIPT
========================================
seated god bless you saints good to be back in the house of the lord all right we're continuing on with our little sunday school lesson in the book of hebrews and uh if the brothers could go ahead and pull that powerpoint up for the next few minutes and uh just kind of summarize where we left off it's been been a while so you might not remember and uh so um this this first slide is just kind of a review of where we left off in hebrews one just kind of summarizing so the the the main topic of chapter one in hebrews is is god has he's revealed himself in a lot of different ways in the in the past and through the old testament and at the culmination of the old testament and then jesus christ the one that was speaking to the prophets comes upon the scene himself the one that had been foretold and and he's kind of the uh the fulfillment of the all of the old testament uh being manifested there at the end and so paul is setting forth that christ christ's greatness that he's the heir of all things he's the one who's both the creator and heir and he's also a perfect reflection of god if you want to know what god is look at that man because he's the the express image of his person his and his word is so powerful that all he's made is sustained by that word everything that you can see every the world the the the the moon circling the planet earth the sun everything the way that everything is situated that the the grass growing in the in the in your yard every everything that you can see is uphill by his word and it's this person who's provided pure if you keep reading through hebrews just to kind of summarize where paul's going he's this this person who has provided purification for sins and taken his seat at the right hand of majesty in heaven and that paul's going to get into that more in chapter 8 and 10 and 12. but he's got a position jesus christ and he has a position and eminence far beyond anything that the angels can claim so paul's setting the setting the stage for us to understand the deity and the magnificence and who this man is that that came so that the hebrews could have understanding that this is not just another preacher or a good prophet or something but this is actually god manifest in the flesh so if we kind of read the actual if we go to the next slide and just kind of read what paul actually said just real quick before we get into the lesson here god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and that's uh it it just it just almost boggles my mind how every one of these things every one of these sentences that paul said is just laden down with so many rich things that we want to unpack and one one of the things that sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so maybe we'll get into that a little bit this this morning as as paul kind of at the end of hebrews chapter one he gets into that thought again sit sat down so we'll look at that a little bit later being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they and what what more excellent name could that he have obtained and he he was actually god in the flesh he was he was he was god manifested for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten in the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him again so paul setting up setting the stage that that this is this is actually god manifest in the flesh and of the angels he saith who make it his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire so let's dwell on that last scripture and in the previous lessons if you remember we kind of laid out the case that paul when he speaks of angels he's actually begins we brought the thought down to down actually to the earth where the angels that he's speaking of actually the ministers to bring the gospel to share to bring the word to you and so he's saying here who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire and we talked about how the ministers are actually anointed by a supernatural by anointed by deity minister spirits they're ministering spirits to bring the word so they're anointed by by they're bringing a thought that it's not something that they thought of it's actually something that they're bringing a thought that god is giving them a a supernatural idea who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire now to kind of to kind of take that thought you have to kind of you know think about how when when moses as he was in the wilderness uh you know he when he when he met that that burning bush he it it was it kind of set his life on fire and he began to he began to have have something to say and and you know the psalms 104 says who maketh his angels a lot of times paul when he's when he's when he's uh writing in the book of hebrews he's actually quoting the old testament prophets and you can see that in psalm 104 uh probably 50 of the things he says in hebrews are actually quoting from from the old testament he's just repeating verbatim almost what what they said so moses when he when he got a revelation of of what the word was he began he began he was able to begin to relate that to people and it's like a burning fire and jeremiah kind of speaks to that in jeremiah chapter 20 where it says then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay in other words he had he had a message in his heart and he had he had he was compelled to deliver it you know a lot of times you hear you hear uh people say a young man or whatever they begin to feel like maybe god is placing a calling in their life and they begin to wonder if if they're called to preach if they're called to minister and i maybe just kind of echo these words here if if you've got it like like moses and like jeremiah if you've got a revelation in your heart and it's burning and you've got to share it then that that's that's really maybe god's working doing something in your life but first before you can preach before you can preach you got to have something to preach and i believe any man that's called to preach is preaching not not for fame or popularity or anything like that but because he's got a revelation that he wants to share that can help somebody that when god reveals something to you it it's it's to give out it's to help other people so that's that's really what i minister a minister a flame of fire because there's there's a message in his heart that's burning within him burning burning to give out and you know you know a lot of times you think um you know ministers gotta gotta hop hop around and run up down the aisles and and that's really what the flame of fire is but the flame of fire is actually that there's a message in you to give out to people and you may be able to maybe deliver it calmly and just plainly i think it's almost more important to be able to to to deliver in a way that people can understand and grasp it then maybe to just get so uh hyped up sometimes if we the main thing is that the word is the thing that will deliver us the word is the thing that gives us power and that's why it says his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with for barry and what did job say in in chapter 32 for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me in other words he's got something to say he knows something about god and when you have a revelation from god that can help somebody you want to give it out in psalm 39 my heart was within me my heart was was hot within me while i was amusing the fire burned then spake eye with my tongue and all these places in the scripture it's talking about it's talking about the word that's down in your heart is actually burning so much you got you've got to share it if you've ever you ever had a conversation with somebody and you you can almost see that they're they're they're kind of like in a prison and and that word just goes to burning if you could if you could get them out of their predicament so you want to share something with them in acts chapter 4 says we cannot for we cannot but speak we can't help but speak the things which we have seen and heard we've if you if you've got it all bottled up in you you've got to share it if you've got a revelation of the message of the hour then you've you've got to give it to somebody let's go to let's go to the next the next verse we're just kind of unpacking these scriptures one at a time this morning but under the sun he saith thy throne of god as forever and ever a scepter of righteousness as the scepter of thy kingdom and again he's quoting he's quoting from david that said in chapter 45 of psalms thy throne o god is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter thou lovest righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and if we'll go to the next slide a a a scepter is is is a sign of of authority or sovereignty and and you know a lot of a lot of scholars or whatever will write that down and there's like a long scepter a scepter is what you hold up that has you wears held up to to show that he was had authority when esther came into the into the throne room and there uh so scholars will break that down and there'd be a long staff that that symbolizes royal authority and a short staff that symbolizes royal military power but what what is what is christ's scepter the thing that shows his his power and his authority it's actually his righteousness and that's what he's saying is his scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom and the new living translations translation says you rule with a scepter of justice and the nirv says your kingdom will be ruled by what is right so you think about that that god is god is uh everything about god is what is right and so if you want to be right then get into god if you want to be correct then get into his word because that's the only way that you can find out what is right and true and if we go to the next the next scripture in hebrews 1 9 it says thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with all of gladness above thy fellas now the the uh the the definition for that word righteousness in the in the hebrew lexicon is it refers to the quality of being righteous or in the right and or or just or justness and justice and brother brown said he made these comments about righteousness he said satan's eden is established in sin because satan is sin god is righteousness and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin and he said again the beginning of righteousness is god's revealed truth and the entire church of the living god is built upon that so if we want to know what righteousness is we can open up our bible and we begin to read and out of the pages of god's living word comes comes what right righteousness is and he said righteousness is the attribute of salvation and he said again it's up to us to see that all god's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his righteousness his word so now we're kind of just opposing we're juxtaposing these two thoughts righteousness and iniquity and we're holding these two thoughts up side by side so righteousness is god's word if you want to know what anything right is then you look into god's word and god's word will tell you how to live right and how to do right now to dress right it'll clothe you right it'll make you walk right it'll make you it'll make you come to church and sit in the congregation of the lord it'll line you up so that you're doing right and then so everything that's right is is in god's word because his word is righteousness so now let's look at iniquity and what do we think iniquity would be iniquity would be would be taking that rightness and making it crooked now we'll look at we'll look at where that crookedness comes from crook that the word iniquity in the in the old testament comes from the hebrew word avon which means perversity or depravity or iniquity guilt punishment of iniquity the consequence of punishment for iniquity and brother ram defined iniquity is to know not to do something and to do it anyway and vice versa so in other words if the word says that you should be going to church if the word says that you should be doing it or the word says the words we put it like this the word says you need to be born again you need to be born again and you go in the other direction see that's iniquity working iniquity is to twist the word of god it's actually to take the word of god like like the devil did and speaking through the beast in the garden of eden he took the word of god which was thou shalt surely die and twisted it and made it a little bit crooked and bent it up and so you're you're not gonna you're not gonna surely die just a little bit got a little bit crooked there so iniquity is taking that word of god and twisting it off a little bit let's go to the next slide and an iniquity that word i've owned is related to the word ava means which means to bent to be bent and and uh you know you you follow all it's really interesting how these hebrew words are all kind of related that the same word that means like a bent a crooked road is related to the word that means like a old man with his back all crooked and that's related those all those words are related to the word iniquity avon is related to ava now let's see what ava means a va means to bend or twist or distort to be bent be bowed down be twisted or be perverted to twist or distort to do wrong to commit iniquity to commit to actually commit iniquity so a va that this bending the twisting and you think about why it's almost it's almost almost comical that god as punishment for for the beast twisting the word would turn him into a serpent that goes slithering and twisting and and crook in his crooked way through the through the leaves and through the bushes to as a symbol of what he had done he took the word of god and twisted it so there you got there you got these two things righteousness and iniquity now the only thing the only thing to be right is to get into god's word but to to take god's word and go the other direction to go the other way is iniquity so that's why the bible says that iniquity was found in lucifer back way before before they even the battle even came to the earth iniquity was founded and what was found in him there was something crooked in him that he was taking the word of god and going uh uh going a different path with it amen so in hebrews let's go to the next slide it says thou has a love to righteousness and hated iniquity we're just kind of continuing to dwell on that and brother brown says that iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and will not do it and he said iniquity is something that you've done wrong that you know better that you ought not have done it if i conceive iniquity in my heart god will not hear me iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but won't do it it's iniquity see you know now here's where he's really placing it you know they should stay with the word of god but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of god and do what the organization says the word so straying from the word of god well i don't know my church says we should do it this way and i believe it this away see and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it that's iniquity depart from me you that work iniquity and jesus said you workers of iniquity i didn't even know you and iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and will not do it that's right i see how he's placing it with the word a lot of times we'll get when you when you hear sometimes it preached on or whatever you begin to think well i know i should have shut the fridge door and i didn't do it all right i know i you know i i shouldn't have left that food out on the counter to rot or whatever that not we're talking let's narrow it down to the word it's your attitude to the word that's what we're talking about when you see the word presented plainly before you and you step away from it you go in a different direction then there's there's iniquity and he said uh that that next the last quote you workers of iniquity i didn't know you and iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and will not do it and every man knows now here he's placing it plainly every man knows that he's got to be born again by the spirit of god we know that you've got to be born again that's the word that that jesus told the nicodemus jared in john chapter 3 you've got to be born again to so anything contrary to that when you begin to go in a different direction there's iniquity iniquity is what iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding to it when you know your creeds are wrong and you still hold to it that's iniquity now now the remedy for iniquity if we go to the next slide in psalm chapter 32 david said i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not heard i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin and isaiah tells the story about the the sarah from coming with the live coal and it took his iniquity away so what takes your iniquity away iniquity is taken away when you come to the one that has the righteousness you come to his word and his word will actually take your iniquity away and that's why in the next verse or if you go to the next slide it says it keeps going on it says thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even that god hath anointed thee with it all of gladness above thy fellas and now that's a reward almost that that when you when you come to the place where you would rather have a nic a righteousness than iniquity come to the place where you begin to respect the word of god then god will fill you with the holy ghost now see he filled jesus with the holy ghost without measure because he was god god in fullness the fullness of god made manifest for us so brother ram says about that and we'll just have a few more minutes and then we'll we'll we'll we'll stop here he said and god keeps his word he said oh we're anointed with the oil of gladness talking about what the oil of gladness is not all out of your body and the whole nothing can come out of your body that can do you any good and the whole armor of god is supernatural what is the armor of god and he goes on and he says again in the green text nothing you have to see nothing you have to feel you got to believe it jesus never did say did you see it did you feel it he said did you believe it did you believe it so the oil of gladness and and a man rented from the presence of the lord he said pour in the oil of gladness this week lord in our souls it's the spirit quickening the word and you to make it come to life and in the next on the next slide he said in john chapter 3 for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily in colossians 2 9 and isaiah 61 says the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meek so that the oil of gladness was upon him the whole all of the spirit was poured out on him and i think i think as christians we we have confidence to know that that same spirit that was in him is in us by the new birth to accomplish the same works to do the same things in our lives that was done in him and and real quick on the next slide just to kind of close out this this topic anointed by the word he is the anointing christ coming to his body he said christ is the word we all know the anointing is christ it comes on the word that makes the word live that is the anointing christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in divine healing whatever more see and christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife to become one now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the bible all of it is yours everything is promised at this age is yours because that same spirit that was in him is in you and and it makes us anointed for a purpose if we'll go to the next slide now charles spurgeon said about the oil of gladness that he said the gladness of our lord lord jesus may be viewed first as the gladness which he had in his work in other words he had a purpose in his life he was anointed to actually to to accomplish something and you know i i i think i've said this many times before if you want to kind of get rid of depression or whatever you know you you find a find a purpose in your life and that's what the holy ghost is for us to give you a purpose in your life something to do and that's why in luke chapter two he said when his when his parents uh he he turned up missing and his parents came out uh began to look for him he said how is it that you sought me wished ye not that i must be about my father's business because he had a purpose in his life there was something for him to do and in john 4 32 he said he told he told the disciples when they went looking for him at the at the well when he was talking to the woman at the well and they and they were asking him if he was hungry and he said i've got meat to eat that you know not of and his meat was to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work in other words he was anointed to do a purpose he had a purpose in his life so if you've got that oil of gladness in your heart you're anointed also for a purpose and your purpose is to fulfill his word just like his purpose was to fulfill the word of god in psalm 47 chapter 40 it says i delight to do thy will o my god ye thy law is within my heart i believe every christian here today wants to do the will of god and we'll we'll maybe close on this scripture because the bible in hebrews chapter 1 verse 10 the next slide and and it closes yeah it goes it goes into the next this next scripture it says that thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture thou shalt fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail and i think again you know the whole the whole topic of hebrews chapter one is paul's trying to sit in your mind in the in the mind of those hebrews who this man is that he's talking about and here he's kind of continuing on that thought that this man is is the unchanging god in the beginning he's the one that laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of his hand so you can see how you know over time as things begin to um uh the earth begins to change and trees fall over and get washed away in the river and and and land and the land changes but yet god remains the same despite how we we we you know we we get old and we're gonna get frail as we get older but yet he's the same his word is the same age after age now down at the bottom right hand corner you can see i i i guess there's a movie or something about los angeles sliding in the same sea so i i stole a picture of that and put it up there so you can see that even even law saying that god's word is going to be fulfilled and his despite everything around you that that uh you know things changing all over the place his word is the same thou art the same and thy years shall not fail so we'll just we'll just kind of quickly read rita if we go to the next slide real quick and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but under the sun he saith thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with all of gladness above thy fellows and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens of the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool and we'll stop there and continue there the next time god bless you the musicians can go ahead and come forward
