6 and then we'll be reading from matthew 23 and titles the measure of the fathers and i just want to look at a couple of things tonight so let's just all bow our heads and just speak to the author before we read our heavenly father lord jesus we just so thank the lord to be in your house again father lord that lord we are your purchase of your blood lord it's not anything that we could do in ourselves lord but it's you lord that we have nothing to boast in but you and lord we're just so thankful lord that you've brought us this far lord lord be just so thankful for amazing grace where would we be without grace tonight lord jesus father we just pray that you come and have your will and way with us tonight lord come speak lord minister to each heart and each life each need represented in this building lord father we continue to remember the ones that are sick and afflicted lord jesus the ones that are not here with us and lord we just know that you have your hand upon them lord we still continue to call their name lord but lord realize that lord that it's all in your hands and lord we just give you praise for the lord because we know it's a finished work of calvary lord we know by the scripture says that by your stripes we were healed and lord we know it's the finished work and we just give you thanks in honor for it and lord for each one that has a need here tonight lord jesus we know that you're the waymaker lord you're the problem solver lord for whatever we have need of lord you're here with us tonight you said where are two or three are gathered in

lord just continue to strengthen them bless them for their labors lord we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen ephesians chapter 6 and it says children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord and so we'll go to matthew chapter 23 and beginning at verse 27 here and jesus is speaking to the scribes and the pharisees and he says woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like undelighted sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and goddesses sepulchers of the righteousness and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets we know they're liars wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets you serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify and some of them you shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood upon the earth from the righteous from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zechariah's son abercross whom ye slew between the temple and the altar verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation amen god bless you tonight you may seated i think uh did i skip this verse i did i was that was what i was thinking because i got to look and i'm thinking i missed one hey i missed the very one that i was looking at he says where verse 31 says therefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers and this is your serpent you generation of vipers how can you escape the nation of hell amen so god bless you um yeah i was i got to think i'm trying to figure out i've missed my point somewhere amen i didn't even try to go down the rabbit trail i guess i was going down one but uh praise the lord tonight i thought about the measure of the fathers and you know it's a i was reading it and it they just kind of stood out to me and uh you know the lord just brings inspiration to things in the scripture when you're reading it just brings things out but uh yeah i was thinking about father's day and you know i don't always like a lot of ministers we don't try to think about father's day or mother's day or christmas or or whatever but uh you know sometimes it just that's the way it comes to you and you just pick up the inspiration and but um i was i was thinking about this and thinking about father's day and the fathers and you know i appreciate the the men of god that have been placed in in my life that i've been associated with and the the the men that have really just been real real men of god real fathers and you know brother branham said in and the world is falling apart in 1963 and and brother brown says he said how far they missed the the meaning of christmas and he's talking about the holidays it's become just a commercial act all the holidays have become that mother's day father's day and every day ought to be mother and father's day and then somebody they have christmas and all these things but he said every day ought to be father's day and mother's day you know well as a reason i read the scripture there where paul said in ephesians that we ought to honor our father and mother obey your parents in the lord for this is right you know and i got thinking about my dad i thank god for my dad for what he meant to me i was reading where brother brown was talking about his dad you know a lot of people didn't wouldn't have thought much highly of charles branham but he thought a lot of him you know he really loved his dad and he might not had a a great name but he meant a lot to brother brownham and what is what his dad done for him and you know i i appreciate the the men that that have been placed in my life and what has um the men that have crossed my path it's been a blessing to me and uh i wrote several years ago when i posted uh there were four men in my life that really just were a blessing to me that i i thought highly of and two of them are here tonight and uh one of them was my dad he's going on and i had a math teacher in high school and he's still alive he lives in north carolina and danny seaver is his name and when i i had a hard time uh growing up we all have we all have our uh times in life where you feel like you don't fit in you're you know you have to go through all these things and you you'll be surrounded by people and you always feel like you're on an island and you know we all go through those times of growing up it's just part of being an adolescent you just have to learn how to grow you know and and he really was a a person that really stood out to me that was a real blessing to me to help me out and then the two that are here tonight that really have been a blessing to me is brother donnie and pop brother dale and i tell you what uh i don't know what i'd have done with them over the years if it hadn't been both of them and they've been a real blessing to me and so i just want to say thank you and you know i look back and if i if i accomplish anything in this world if i if i'm out to anything if if i'm a asset to the kingdom of god then i can say that brother dale has you know he has a part of that because i wouldn't be here without him and i certainly wouldn't be here without brother donny and i just want to say i appreciate that and all your other brothers i appreciate each one of you and y'all been a blessing to me and you know and so i i want to i want to look at this tonight i just want to get that off off my heart because you know i'd rather give you a rose now than a a wreath later on you know i i you know i just want i just want to say that one thing you know i appreciate you and you know like brother like uh brother wade was talking about you know pat on the back sometimes you know i think i'd take a pat on the back sometimes more that would take money i you know it mean that means more to you than than a lot than a lot of other things you because you just can't buy that sometime you can't put a price on that but i i want to go back and and look at this this word of the measure of the fathers and you know we've all had fathers and um one one one part of this would be you know we have a heavenly father and and he and he's the one that's over all this and he controls all of it and then we have fathers in the gospel we have natural fathers we have father figures the scripture tells us you know always go back to the scripture where paul's i believe he's telling timothy you know he said entreat the older one he said rebuke not an elder but and treat him as a father and he said the older women treat his mother the younger ones are sisters and you know so we treat each other as brothers and sisters well you know to they said and to give those that are due double honor we give them higher honor and so you know there's there's people in my life that i i think of as as a father and i you know and i whatever i do because you know there's so many times in life when we see things that come our way and and you know we want to be we want to be we want to make people proud you know we want we want to be what you know that somebody can look up to and and these things and you know but many times when we go through things in life and things don't work out the way we expect them to and everything like it you know when you when you have children and you and you see things that go on you you can only lead your children so far you can only take your children and you know you as as the scripture said you know fathers don't bring your children to wrath but bring nurture them bring them up in the admonition of the lord so you know there's a there's as they grow you know you can you can only bring them so far i think i think about brother dale always talking about josh being little and you know getting close to the wood stove and you know you just tell him hot hot you know well you know what you can only tell them that much so many times you know it's just like you know the boys you know when they were growing up you can only tell them so many times about something but then you know what you got to let them do it themselves it's like don't stick that in the in the light socket don't stick that in the wall well here you know what if you want to stick this clothes pin or this paper clip in there just go ahead well you can tell them not to do that but you know what they're still going to do it why because they'll get to the point where i'm going to find out and so many times in life you know we have children and you can only go so far to do what you can for them but you know what that doesn't never whatever they do you know it doesn't change the love that you have for your children and you know and so you see you know they they disappoint you and no doubt you disappoint them they they they know how brother brown said you know they walk on your feet one day and the next time they walk on your heart but you know what you never you never lose that love for them now you don't agree with the way they act you don't condone their actions you don't condem you don't condone the things that they say but it doesn't change who they are and if and if so much more that that we do that for our children how much more does our heavenly father love us for what he's done for us and where we came from and then where we've come to today what god has done for us that he loves us and if we see if we as as he was jesus was speaking he said you know if if you have a son and he asks for bread or if he asked for you know uh for a fish he said he said would you give him a stone or would you give him a serpent and he said he said ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children he said how much more will your heavenly father give unto you that ask and one place he actually says how much more will he give you the holy ghost to them that ask so all the things that we have that we have that we desire everything that we have a need for that he's already given to us it's already our possession but the problem is is do we claim what god has given us because we'll we allow the devil to get in our way and he'll stand there and and we can we'll take condemnation when he tries to tell us that you know what he doesn't remember the things of the past when he tries to tell us all of these things are in the sea of god's forgetfulness well praise god we serve a god that is so great he can forget when we can't forget when we can't forgive ourselves here's one that will lead us to the place to show that we can forgive ourselves because there's a there's a process that we can overcome these things and take them out of our mind so we can overcome our stinking thinking so all of these things are such a blessing to us that what god has has called us in this hour what god has called us to how blessed we are and so to see now here in in matthew when jesus is speaking to the to the pharisees the scribes and the pharisees you know it's so it's so amazing and and we're going to get lord when we'll try to get into some other scriptures later on but i i want to i want to show you this this here in the scripture because when you look at what jesus is speaking to the pharisees the scribes and the pharisees and what they were doing and here they are talking now can you imagine here these men are well renowned men have to have these great educations all of this scholarship and all of the great things that they have and here they are these men standing out here looking at these great uh sepulchers these great monuments that are built to people and uh sepulchers these great monuments that are built to people and here they are standing here in front of all of these people in here and here they are talking about the great things that god done in the past here they are standing there polishing these great these great monuments to these great people oh isaiah and ezekiel killing all these great men and talking about what god done and what god said all the great things that took place in the past but you know here they are talking about their fathers were the one that killed them and they were out there saying well you know what if i was there i wouldn't have done that i wouldn't have never done that now now my father's our our ancestors now they killed them they rejected the word and they killed the killed the prophets and the righteous and put them in the graves but we wouldn't have done that here we are we're standing here looking at all these great things talking about it and saying they're talking to jesus and jesus is speaking to them and telling them that you're hypocrites you're a generation of vipers why because you've done the exact same thing that they done because the first thing that they done was reject the word and here they're standing in front of the scribes and pharisees and he's saying listen he said y'all done the exact same thing you have rejected the word jesus is standing there in front of him and tell him it searched the scriptures and see that if if i don't fulfill every single word he said in them you say that you have eternal life he said but they testify of me but you've rejected what i've said when he pointed out in the scripture now here's now here is this foundation that has been laid because they're speaking and then jesus says see your own testimony your own witness says that you're the sons of those men and and and so and really in two ways he brings it out number one he brings out the fact that they are the the physical children the lineage of those men but he's also bringing out the fact that they are also the spiritual lineage of the devil because they are the father that's their father and he said they're the son and he said you're doing a generation of vipers he said you're fulfilling exactly what jesus what the devil done what satan done he was a rejecter of the word and what did he do when they rejected the word they killed him exactly what he done what they done from the beginning what did kang do cain started in the beginning and when he would not accept the word when he would not change his way why would he made him a murderer well because if you can't deny the word if you can't get rid of the word then what are you going to do how do you get rid of the effect of the word is you get rid of the people then what did brother ram say in the church age book how does how does he going to destroy trying to destroy the bride is by decree discrediting the word of god and then he's trying to destroy the people of god what is was every gun against the bride why because he's trying to discredit the word so that's this whole thing is trying to destroy every effect of it but here they are speaking of these things and he said yeah but he said when you look back when you look back in the and see what your fathers have done what your ancestors have done and you realize hey they've done that and those men were righteous because the word that the prophets because the word of the lord that came to the prophets came to pass so when it came to pass then you know what your fathers were they were liars and hypocrites and you could see how they were fought they were the children of the devil and when they've done all these things then when he turns around and says you see what they've done and here you are doing the exact same thing he said you're worthy of greater damnation than they are why because when you look back and you see what has taken place and you don't walk in it then to them that's iniquity he said you're you're you're children of hypocrisy and iniquity why because you've not walked in what you've seen because your own testimony is what holds you it's what binds you you're held by your own testimony and he says see then then he says then he tells them he said well then fill ye up the measure of your fathers so what is he saying the the the the doctrine the actions the legacy of your fathers whatever has come in the past whatever they've done that's the measure that's come and he said all of that that took place in the past he said then you fill up or what or if you if you look at other translations of it it says you fulfill the let the measure or the height the level that your father said so what your fathers have set as a goal as a as a as a uh try to think of a of a good uh as as a as a legacy or a level a a hike that they've set then that's what you're coming to he said so go ahead because you know what you walk in the fullness of what your fathers have done he said then go ahead and fulfill it come into the fullness of that because that's your legacy because that's what you believe then go ahead and do it all the way to its fullness walk in the fullness of that and manifest exactly what you are and so if he's calling them to do that all bring that all the way to a fullness bring it all the way to completion bring it up you know don't don't do it halfway don't don't just hold back but just do every bit of it bring it to a fullness then then when we look at this then be he said full up fill up the measure of your fathers so as we see that that later on we'll look a little more at that but to understand that whatever you have your fathers have brought then that is what we should fill up that's what we should manifest so when we look at this you know because it becomes it it's a several different things to look at tonight but you know one of the things we look at just in the natural you know the the legacy or the the way that you bring your children up the scripture says you know bring them up in the admonition of god he said train up a child in the way it should go he said when it's old it won't depart from it well you know brother branham said he said the problem is he said it's not children delinquent it's not juvenile delinquency he said his parent delinquency so what is the problem he said the problem is is the parents have not brought the children to the place but he says now bring your children to the place that you've that you've laid out for your fathers have laid this out and that's where you should go see it it's so important you know to hold to hold the standard in front of your children because they they have you know because they can find all kinds of friends in the world that you know that have all kinds of ideas and and worldly spirits and all kinds of stuff but you know they need to have somebody that they can look at and not just not just parents but you know everyone in the church i i was thinking about where brother dale went when he goes to dedicate babies and you know it's like listen we dedicate all of us why because we are all charged with one thing and that's living a life in front of that child that they see jesus christ it's not just the parents but you know what if we come to this church and we and we claim that we claim the name of jesus christ to be christians then we ought to live a life that that is pleasing to the lord that is above reproach you know that is that is that is my goal and you know i i fall short of that i know that but you know that's still my goal i still my desire to come to that place i still have a goal that i'm still trying to reach but you know what i'm not giving up but you know i still want i still want people to see jesus christ i still want as the song always talks about i love that song and one of these days maybe i'll sing it but you know it the words are when they looked they beheld him when i spoke they could hear him when i walked my every footstep led them all to calvary he said let others have worldly fame but when someone speaks his name let them recall they first saw him and me i want i want the world to know which side that i'm on i don't want i don't want there to be any kind of ambiguity or anything like that where somebody gets confused i want them to know which side that i'm on i want somebody when they look at me that they know this is a christian not somebody just playing games or playing church or just looking or trying to act apart i want somebody know that this is this is a real born-again son of god that has that has come under a crimson flow and has been changed by the holy ghost that the word in me has changed me into his image that they can see what takes place when when you come through the calvary what happens to a man what happens to a woman when you come through calvary and they can look and say that's that's a christian that's what i swear that's what my goal is not just not just play church let's be the bride now this is uh jeremiah 31 and beginning at verse 27 to bring that up jeremiah says behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of men and with the seed of beast and it shall come to pass excuse me that like as i have watched over them to pluck up to break down to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they break although i was an husband unto them saith the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and right in their hearts and i will and will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord and i will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more amen so when we go here jeremiah's speaking to the the children and we know that jeremiah was a um captivity um when they went into captivity was one of the prophets there and and you know when when he began to speak to him as they had went in and you know he began to tell them what was going to take place and here they they go in when uh babylon takes over and and all that when when they go in you know the the children when they come up from under all of this and they see all these things you know the children are the ones they blame their parents for this and the scripture says you know that he said the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge meaning meaning that that that the fathers committed a committed a sin and now now the children are paying for it they're in they're in captivity because of what their fathers have done and so here they are you know they're they're talking about these things but here's here's god's speaking through jeremiah tell them he said now listen hey you blame you blame your parents for where you're at but then he said listen he said i'm going to there's coming a day when i'm going to speak and put my law in your hearts and i'm going to speak to you and take you and you're going to be my people why because they were already his people but what had happened is they came out from underneath it but when you when you see when when jeremiah begins to rebuke the children of israel for their condition when where they're at and what was going on the problem was they're looking back and they're complaining about what the fathers have done and jeremiah comes on the scene and he begins to tell them your problem is not what your fathers have done that's where you're at right now because of what your father's done the reason you can't come out is because you're still holding on to the doctrines and the things that your father's held on to and that's what's holding you back in captivity is because you're still down there doing the exact same things the same idol worship and all the same things that your your father's done they're in the same condition and so you know many people they want to try to find somebody why why they're into why they're in the condition they are today just like brother branham said we can't blame adam and eve for our problems we know that the fall happened because of what they done but you know what today is not we can't just turn around and say well you know what i don't have to do nothing because we're just going to blame adam and eve for it well it's not adam and eve's fault anymore why because you know what there come a day that you and i we both came to a an age of accountability and we had to we had to take accountability for ourselves we're now accountable for what we do has as a man said one time that he said it's it's not it's not bad to be in he's wrong and be in these places he said the problem is a stay in there people people go well i i'm just this way i'm just like no you there's a way out we were all born in sin shaping iniquity we all come into this world speaking lives we're all children of wrath even as others what he say ye have who he has quickened who were dead and sin and trespasses and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god rich in mercy god has made a way for us so we can look back well you know we come this way but you know what we don't have to stay this way but the problem is is people just want to sit down he's like well i i just have i just have this well you know what it's not that god hasn't made a way to get out from underneath that you know it's just like going to the doctor and you know er you know you have some kind of ailment or some kind of problem or whatever and you know what whatever the issue is and you don't follow the doctor's directions i i knew i knew a young man when when he was about my age now but when he when he was baby he had had problems with his feet he had club feet and all these things and and they had to had to do surgery to fix his feet where he could walk and and they had to do both of his feet and work on them and everything and you know there came a time where you know his parents when they told him after he had the surgery you know they had to do physical therapy on him and there was a lot of stretching and massaging and all these things that they had to do with him and it was just a long process you know it's not going to fix it overnight but this is what you've got to stay on top of you've got to do this on a regular basis you've got to be faithful to taking care of this problem and the problem was is when he got when he started growing well you know what he just cried too much well you know what ain't nobody gonna gonna be wanting to do that when you when you operate on their ankles and you and you do all those things and then you turn around it's like well we got to massage those feet we got to stretch all those things to get their feet lined up well you know you walk around with your feet turned in all the time well you know when he grew up he still had problems with his feet why because his parents didn't do what was what the doctor told him to do and you know the problem is when he grew up and as he got older you know he had more problems that he had to work on taking care of himself why because his parents didn't take care of it and brothers and sisters it's the same way when we have children you've got to bring them up and you've got to put them on the right path and you've got to fix them and hold them up and get them ready where they can walk because you know what it ain't going to be pleasing to you and it ain't going to be pleasing to them but you've got to make sure that they get on the right path that they can stand on their own two feet whatever it is you've got to get them ready that they can do these things why because it's like well we just want to pray the lord let the lord take it well god gave you sins and he gave you time and he gave you the effort he gave you the intelligence to do it yourself and he gave you the holy ghost and he gave you the word well then you know what it's something that you've got to do you've got to do it for yourself you know what we just we can we can pray and for for the holy ghost to fall but you know what you've got to be there holy ghost you've got to be the one that's got a lot to raise them up and stand between them and the devil in the world and hold hold things back and you've got to be the one to set an example and you've got to set a standard and you've got to resist the devil getting into your home all those things because you know what you can stand there and you can tell them oh what are right and wrong but you know what they've got to stand up one of these days is take a take account for themselves we see we see kids and you know they get out and every you know every little thing that comes along is shiny and flashy this worldly you know kids are attracted to it young people are attracted to it well i should say everybody's attracted to it you know as long as as long as you're in this world you still got something you know there's things in the world that still draws you and turns your eyes no i'm superman nothing phases me i don't i don't know who you come from but you you walk in the the christian walk a lot of the rest of us are walking because you know what it's a battle every day but you see these things they they draw kids attentions they got young people's attention they're trying to well you got to stand between all that you got to be the one to break all that all that silliness the world's full of it and everything you try to try to bring your children up a certain way well you know the thing is is when children get you tell them and you try to set examples and you and you try to set things a standard and and all kinds of things well you know and and the situ in the world that we live in today the situation that we live in today there's lots of kids that are out there and they all got cell phones they got little mini computers and you see you know i mean it got so bad at our plan well they had to put signs up saying you know don't walk in this way looking at your com your phone because peop we got forklifts and people are looking at it like this and don't even know where they're tripping over stuff because they can't get out of their cell phone long enough and some of them some of them are the ones that the companies actually paid for they give them the supervisors and they still can't walk around without running into stuff but you see these kids you know they get on these things and you know you tell them listen and you try to set parameters and everything like that and you kids aren't kids aren't above being tempted and you see these kids and they got these little uh apps and um software and all kinds of stuff well you know what there's kids that sit and spit all day long and they're trying to hack software they're trying to get passwords so they can get past the the firewall or whatever they got set up on their phones because they're trying to get in there so they can get to the good stuff they spent all our time trying to get everybody you know because you're trying to keep them from stuff and it's like well you don't need to be on on all this tick tock and everything else and then you know they get on youtube and everything like that and then you know you you can try to lay out a a plan and you you try to tell them what the scripture says well the first thing you do they brother madam says if you don't get your children to christ he said if you don't get them to god he said rock and roll's going to get them you know what that's every kind of garbage music that's out there that's what rock and roll is and people people say well i don't i don't i don't know about that what do you mean by rock and roll well let me let me give you an example if you go to um and you don't have to but you can take my word for it if not you can look it up but i i promise you this is this is true you go to the rock and roll hall of fame and you look up and see and you know what and they put people in there from every genre of music in the rock and roll hall of fame there's rap artists there's country artists everybody that you can think of that's music and you know why because every one of them and they'll tell you every one of them is an influence in what rock and roll becomes so when you put in all these even when you put in christian artists and all this stuff when you put all these ones in the rock and roll hall of fame then don't tell me that rap music ain't part of that one brother said rock and roll don't tell me that rap music don't fall into it don't tell me that country don't fall into that don't tell me all this other stuff that goes don't fall into that same category if they're if they're putting it in the hall of fame it's the same thing so you know what if you don't get your children to christ if you don't get them to the right place and what do they do they're going to be feeding on that and you can you can do whatever you want to and and live the best kind of life and and do whatever around your mom and daddy and all this kind but god knows where you're at god knows what you do god knows what you listen to god knows what you read god knows what you're watching you can feed your mind on foolishness if you want to you can feel you feel your mind full of garbage but you know what you can't feed on that on a continuous basis on a continual basis and feed on garbage and have anything but have garbage come out whatever you sow whatever seed whatever kind of seed you're sowing is what you're going to reap whatever you see on the cakes on the inside whatever you're feeding whatever you're living on is what's going to be manifested you're not going to get away from it but they feed on that stuff all the time and they oh man this is so good it's so good and they they oh they they they love trying to get people they so they love that that excitement that comes when hey mama don't know this and daddy don't know this so we're sneaking around and god knows and just remember every time you open open that stuff up and you get in there and you're and you spend hours and hours and hours listening to whatever you just you just put it in there your christian rock whatever you want to put your label oh so well it's only it's only such and such you know it's only this it's only that you know listen if it's not pleasing to the lord you know what brother branham said brother man said there is no such thing as a white black bird there ain't no such thing as a drunk sober man and there ain't no such thing as something that's of the devil that's pleasing to the lord you're not you're not going you're not going to have that well that's that's free tonight but just remember you'll give an account for it some some men's go before them some men's sins go after we all give account for it ezekiel this is ezekiel 18 and i've i put the whole chapter on here but i promise you i'm not going to read the whole chapter but that is that is the whole chapter but i just want to read a few scriptures here ezekiel 18 verse 1 says and the word of the lord came unto me saying came unto me again saying what mean ye that you use this parable this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel he said behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die he said but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right and have not eaten from the mountains neither have lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife neither has come near to a mistress woman and hath not oppressed any but have restored to the dead or his pledge has spoiled none by his by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the nakedness with a garment he that hath not given forth upon usury neither to have taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity have executed true judgment between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god so we say when when he begins to speak of all this as jeremiah was speaking that you know they were saying this is this is a hard hard thing that because he's saying we're we're we're under we're under this problem that our fathers created and we're so we're bound by this and we're still under this but then when he comes ezekiel comes to him and says listen you're never going to have this issue again because i'm coming to lay out the word to you that you can't blame the ones in the past you can't when ezekiel began to tell him listen this is a statue that i'm going to give you just like jeremiah was telling them he said listen this is this is the way this is going to be it's it's laid out now you can't blame them in the past because it's going to be laid out before you that you've got to learn how to walk you've got you've got to do these things and so he lays out all as he tells them all these are things that you've got to do you've got to walk in my statutes and you've done none of these things and he said you shall live but as we continue on so we see these things that what that they had to do in verse 14 when he begins to talk about the men that have done all these things and that having a son he says now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like he said that have not eaten upon the mountains and if you if you don't know what that is that's where you when they were sacrificing and eating unto idols they were in the mountains so that's what they were doing that's where they had their revelry and and their and their parties and and such neither have lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel have not defiled his neighbor's wife neither have the pressed any hath not withheld the pledge neither have spoiled by violence but have given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment that hath taken off his hand from the poor and hath not received usury usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in his statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live for as his father because he truly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and that that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all his statutes and hath done them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die of the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither and neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteous the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him and if the wicked shall turn from his sins that he hath committed and kept all his statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him and his righteousness he hath done he shall live have i any pleasure at all with the weak that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed in all his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal here now o house of israel is not my way equal or not your ways unequal when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die so and when when you read all of this and and so you know when you see what what god is telling them and when they when they go back and look and when they see what has taken place when when the son sees that his father has sinned and all the wickedness that his father has done when he takes account of that and he doesn't do what his father has done he said then his father's sin doesn't rest upon him he said but his father's sin rests upon him but then when he goes down later and he picks up the scripture later on you can walk in righteousness but he said as soon as you turn from your from the way of righteousness and he said when you walk away from that and you and you still and whether you die in that wickedness and you can you can walk good and you can you can walk in the way of the lord all these years but as soon as you turn away and you die then you know what it doesn't remember any of the any of the good that you've done all it remembers is the is the sin that falls upon you and he says he said that the wicked can the wicked and his son can be wicked also and they can all do all the wickedness they won't do but when they get to the place where they turn from their wickedness and they begin to walk in the statutes of god he said then all the things in the past doesn't remember them anymore and so here they are then then when the children of israel come before god and they're saying well god that's not fair how is it how is it that somebody can walk because you know they have a scale set up and it's like well you know what i only do 25 bad stuff but i do 75 percent good stuff so that all the way the scale i don't tip the scale in my favor well you know what i only do just this a little bit over here and i just do this a little bit over here but no it's all sin it's either you walk in the ways of god and you walk in the statutes of god and you do the way of god or you're not in the way of god at all you know he's not god don't have a scale where you where you he don't grade you on a curve you don't have it you don't have any of these get out of free jail cards or anything like that there's no there's no gray areas with god it's either you're in the way or you're not and so that's what he was telling if you're going to walk in the ways of god then you've got to be in the ways of god all the time but you know when you see those things when you see that your fathers have done those things then you've got to get away from the things or they if they do the right thing you see them walking in righteousness then you have to walk in their footsteps then you should be following what your fathers have done you shouldn't be following something else i was thinking about that old song about uh i'm looking for a hundred because 99 and a half won't do well because god if you're not going to if you're not going to be fully sold out and committed to god you know god don't want to don't want something 99.9999 percent well how many of y'all want to go to work in the morning and and the boss comes in there and says listen we're only paying you 99 and a half percent of what you make well ain't that good we're paying you 99.7 percent of your money is that good what if i what if i pay you 99.9999 percent of your pay it's like listen we're either going to get a hundred and we're gonna we're gonna do the math right or i'm getting out of here i ain't working for free and i ain't working on a prorated discount either i'm gonna get all of it or ain't gonna do none of it well don't think that god's gonna play around and allow you to get above with someone he said if if eve if the whole thing if all creation fell off of one word how you gonna get back if you don't be taken all the word what if the mailman come by and delivered 99.9 of your mail and the things that you're looking for don't show up but you get your coupons and your bills but all the other stuff that you're really looking forward to don't show up now how many's gonna be happy about that it's like no i want all of it now you can keep the coupons and you can keep the junk mail you can keep all the flyers because you work for the mail hey listen and we don't we don't need any more uh political advertisements praise the lord there's coming a day there won't ever be another political advertisement you will never have to see one come in the mail because all you have to do is end up throwing them in the trash praise the lord get rid of passing all of it but you know if if you're if you won't want a hundred percent god wants a hundred percent god wants a hundred percent from you and i that we give a hundred percent not not just not not just a portion but no we have to be totally sold out surrendered to god i'm not i'm no i'm no longer my own i belong to jesus i'm not my own i've been bought with a price i am what he's made me i'm a prisoner of love the love of god see we have to come to this place to realize god wants us to be this way what we've seen we've got to be totally surrendered totally sold out now this is uh hebrews chapter 12 verse 6 says he says for whom he says for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth he said if you endure chastening god dealeth with you deal with you as with sons as sons as with sons for what son is he whom the lord chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and have and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastising chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness and to them which are exercised thereby i uh going to tell a little story and uh every time every time i read this this scripture and it was one of the first times i ever preached here and uh mom my mom and dad were here and uh first time actually the first time they ever got to hear me preaching in person but dad was sitting back toward the back and i was reading this scripture and and talking about having having fathers that chastised us and we gave them honor and i was i was talking about the way you know my mom and dad you know and dad dad was uh for for y'all that that knew my dad you know my dad didn't play no games he's a yeah when it come when it come down to business there's lots of sunday mornings i woke up and he would come in and jerk the covers off of us and hit us and wake up well you never wanted him to come back in there to wake you up that was time you woke up praise the lord and hit the floor running because you didn't ever want him to come back in there and wake you up now mom might come in there two or three times and wake you up dad didn't play that game but you always always told the story that i said you know mom you know she might she might beat you but dad's the type person that he'd tell you like listen we got to go outside cause i don't want to get blood on the floor and when i told dad in here dad was sitting toward the back back there where kind of where sister anna is back here and dad was going he stared at me and he come out the door the first thing he told sister dale when he come out the door and he walked outside he said that didn't happen that didn't happen that didn't happen but let me tell you something my dad meant business you know i didn't you don't play games there's time for joking a time for seriousness and you don't want to cross up the two but he said whom the lord loveth he chases there's one thing about it you know when when god speaks god god's not confused about what he's saying just like my dad he didn't he didn't play no games he didn't get confused and when he when he speaks that he if you're a son of god then he said he chasteneth you and deals with you as a son and he and he says we were given fathers who chastened us and he says he said he chastened us after their own pleasure and uh you know always told everybody it's like yeah that's when you know they you think sometimes they just they just whip you because because that feels good but you know what it's not but you know it's it's what they thought was right they chase they chastened us after their own pleasure which means what they thought was correct and you know and and i i will tell one thing about my dad my dad has come back and apologized when he was wrong about things and i tell you what that takes a man and i thought man if i could just be half the man that he was because you know what that really meant that meant a lot to me because you can't because not everybody owns up to their mistakes but he says but he for our prophet why because god don't make mistakes you know god don't make mistakes god don't so whatever god does it's for our benefit you know god don't do things he's like oh i i shouldn't have done that no he doesn't he does it right the first time that we might be partakers of his holiness that all these things come about because they they bring out what god houses for us he says now no chastising chastening of the present seem to be joyous but grievous you know i i've never in the in the process have i ever have ever been happy by it he said well you know all things work together for the good to them that love the lord and it's like well you know you know sometimes we're we just hold on to that scripture because you know we can't see any how this is going to work out we don't see any benefit any of it but you know what god knows how to work it all out he said after he said nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby so these things will benefit us in the in the future and the things that we go through it's a benefit to us so we are we we go through these things and and they're uh a blessing that we don't sometimes we don't see these things but they are a blessing to us and and so as as we see here you know we see the the things that we we saw in the old testament there and and jesus speaking to them as they see the the pattern that they walk in and the measure that the the children walked in as as was a hindrance and a f as a a really a condemnation of falling to them but here he is speaking these things come upon us that it's to be a blessing to us and so as we as we look you know as we see that this this is the the fathers as they went one way was a condemnation this is a blessing so as we see there's a there's a change here that we see that one is one way and one is the other because you know god places people in in our in our lives to bring us to a place and he allows things to happen to bring us to a place and so you know you know i think i thank god because you know when we see the things that that god has has done for us you know because the scripture tells us he he gave us a fivefold ministry the scripture tells us that he gave us he gave us uh pastors to feed us and and not only were they they defeated us but they had hearts their hearts was turned to the people that god could work through them because it was the heart of god in the pastors and in the fivefold ministry to reach the people so all these things that have taken place then it was all of these things were blessings and so um all of these things have come you know ephesians 4 i will read this right here it says ephesians 4 verse 4 says and there is one body one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of us all of all who is above all through all and in you all but unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of god wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first in the lower parts of the earth but he that descended is the same also that ascended far above far above all heavens that he might feel all things so we know that when when these things came we've all been given a measure by the gift of god so we know that he said fill up the measure that your father's laid so as we see what they done is you've seen what your fathers have done and you and you can you're to be held accountable for what you do according to reading there in jeremiah and ezekiel you know what you've seen in the past you've you're held accountable for what you do and it has turned to you and each one of them have to hold on to their accountability they're responsible for their own way and so we see these things and and we know that as they saw this pattern that was laid before them and you know brother branham i was speaking in in the message return and jubilee and and here he's speaking and he says he said you were born you were born again son of god he said stay the way god made you that's right he said many of you pentecostal women he said when a woman does that faults on the outside the outside only expresses what's on the inside it's false on the inside she's got a false denomination she's holding on to instead of christ ought to fill her life with the power of his resurrection instead of that she's took some man-made creed the outside always expresses what's on the inside the trees known by the fruit that it bears oh my i know you might think i'm critical but i'm not critical i'm just trying to tell you what's truth look where it's got our churches today look where we're at he said while our mothers wouldn't have thought of such a thing speaking of of the pentecost he says our brothers wouldn't have thought of such a thing as an organization why you went back there in in his early days and said something about that they'd laugh you right in your face we said we come out of that vomit we come out of that wall oh god called us out he said we went back and see what we got the same thing same thing they are pot all the kettle black yes sir that's right six of one half dozen of the other creeds and things just separated us but brother oh i could hold on to this a long time but let's not do it let me give you one one good news brother he said i i could just hold this for a little time this is the year of jubilee if you've got mixed up in that kind of stuff let's return we got an inheritance the fathers of pentecost fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas let's not walk in this flowery bread of ease by joining some denomination or settling down and saying god bless i'm pentecost he said let's get the experience let's get back to god let's go back to the eagle food let's go back to the leadership of the holy spirit let's go back to the word of god let's go back to the fast and pray while the church forgot the street meetings long ago the church forgot its long nights of prayer why they can't pray 15 minutes no more oh my when it does it it's some it's some little formal thing and half of them fall asleep why it's it's a disgrace children trying to eat a chicken's trying to eat eagles food you can't do it won't digest that's right you're not built for it you're not built for that rugged part got to be built rugged and the only way you'll ever get that is to be born again and change your way and come back he said yes sir return to what it's time to return return to what brother branham return back to the organization i come out of no return back to your inheritance the heritage that our fathers that our father left us he said what kind of inheritance did he leave wait ye in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high that's the inheritance not go join this one and go join that one and go join this one wait till wait till the power comes from on high how long until he said he said until one day two days wait until don't take some little emotion some little frustration wait there until you are dead and buried and born again anew in christ jesus and every pulsation of your life beats out jesus christ so you can see the life of christ reflected right in your living the way you go yes sir till you can find that power like they had back there in the beginning back to a pentecostal inheritance yes sir that's your position possession dominant denominations not your possession pentecost is your possession not a pentecostal organization your fathers came out of such thing the pentecostal experience is your possession examine yourself the sounding of the trumpet what kind of trumpet the word god's trumpet the word of god the whole holy spirit holy ghost is the word in the word amen so i'm gonna finish up here i have have a little bit more but i i just want i just want to share with this you know as as we have we've seen the as that we've laid the foundations of what they've done in the past what we've seen in the past what they saw then you know what it's it's us to fulfill the measure of the fathers and you say what what is what is the measure it's malachi 4. the measure that was given was malachi 4. because he said he said that the the the prophet of malachi the messenger was going to do two things laodicean church age book he said the messenger of malachi 4 revelation is to do two things he said he said according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers too he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so so what when we see that you know when jesus was looking back at them and told them who they were and he says you fulfill fill you up the measure of your fathers well who are our fathers the word that came before us all of the ones he said he said this message would turn us back to the pentecostal fathers to the word that came before us one because then when we see how it turns to goes back to that because here they are they rebuked to do all that god has called us to do because he rebuked them for doing the things that their fathers had done and he told them said you go do what your fathers have done well brothers and sisters god has called us to do the exact same thing walk in the way that he has made he called us to walk in the way that that has been given that's been prepared for us that we've seen that we've seen the ones and he was speaking of the ones in pentecost and what what pentecost done in the past and those that have come before god laid it out before us he said what kind of people are we to be what kind of people we ought to be he said in every work and every deed and every action what kind of people we ought to be because if we've seen what has come before and he said he said they didn't come they didn't come through on a flowery bed of these he said when you see that they had to had to fight to win the prize when all the things that they went through has come to us all the way you know because though all the word has come to us and and all of the all the bloodshed and all the things that has happened all the way to you know because we you know all the sacrifices that has been made all the things that has taken place you know what then we have to what kind of people ought to eat to be if we've seen the things that have taken place if if god has been gracious enough to show us these things what kind of people ought to eat to be that we should face every every day brother i said he said you know every day we should live and walk and speak like it's our last why we should we should walk and we should fulfill walk in the fullness thereof walk in the floor everything that god has given you walk in the fullness of it walking at one because it's because our fathers the ones in the past that have have paved the way have done all the work have struggled and sacrificed to bring us to this place then you know we should be standing so much higher than where we are we should be so thankful and and realize who we are and what and every single thing as brother brian said whatever you do everything we should pretend think look at this like it's our last this we don't we don't know what our last day's going to be but we ought to give our fullness to god we should give every ass to everything we should pay a more earnest to the word that we have heard do the fulfill fill up on the word be the fullness thereof amen let's all stand will have the musicians come i have that desire thank god that we've had fathers that have brought us to this place fathers in the gospel you know i was thinking the other day then you know we have people come in our lives and you know just like children you know you have you have a you have children that that grow up well you know you can only do so much for them when that when they're little you know you can you feed them and you clothe them and you bathe them and you do all those things and you get to the point where you try to teach them how to feed themselves and teach them how to walk but you know there's only so much that you do for them and then the next time you know what they get to a certain age and there comes a teacher and you got to send them off to school try to teach them their abcs and learn how to read and all those things well you know what then there's other people that's got to come along and lead you amen i was thinking about brother dale where he's talking about you know he said all the preachers that's come before him and he said when he even in the baptist church he said all the the pastors that were there you know he thanked them for what they've done for him why because they brought him to a place and so you know they you know all the ones that have come and even even the pastor i think about the pastors that i've had in this message you know and the brothers you know they've done what they could but you know what that wasn't the place that i was supposed to be there was there was a place that each one of them brought me to but you know what i had to go on beyond that and so you know what you don't teach your kids algebra but you know what you want them to learn it so there's somebody else that's got to come on and take this and carry it further and so you know there there is a group that's coming to the fivefold ministry that's continued to carry this thing on and thank god we've gotten to the place that we've got somebody that can carry us all the way and so here we are now we've reached this place well you know now we can come to the fullness that we can come to the finish and that's what that's what my desire is i want i want to do all that i can i i was telling brother donnie i was i was thinking about a message i preached years ago when when you see when you see things and and you see the condition that things are in and there was a the man that told him i was heard about and and years ago he this this man and i i don't remember his name but i just remember the story but he was a he was a missionary in india and every so often he would come to he would come to the united states and as when he come he would come to churches and he would preach and they would raise money for the missions and things that were going on in india and so as he was traveling through this is decades ago but this man was coming through and as he was driving through the midwest he it was going down the road he saw these uh combines out in the field it was on a sunday and he was traveling from one church to another one and he was coming through and he saw all of these combines going through the middle of the the fields everybody just working as fast as they can trying to get everything done and he stopped and he stopped one of the men and he asked him he's like what are y'all doing he said i figured all these people out here church going people he said why are y'all out here working he said oh brother we are because you know he told him i'm a minister he said brother we are he said but you see this field he said it's white it's time for harvest we got to get this field in he said there's a storm coming he said there's a storm coming and he said we're working right now he said because whatever we don't get in is going to be lost and he said brother he said i can't stand here and talk anymore he said i got to get out and he said well god bless you and he went on down the road so thankful that there is a place that we can hide because we can hide under the shelter of his wings why because he has promised that to us but you know what we've got to prepare and we've got to be the ones that the only people that the world's going to know that there's a storm coming that they're not going to be able to stand and that is us we've got to make everyone know we need to make sure the world understands listen you're not you're not going you ain't got some back door way of getting in there's a there's a storm coming and i tell you i that was like five years ago and i that was that just laid on me i and there's times it's still just i i get so wrapped up in that we we need to walk in the fullness fill up on the measure that god has given us walk in the fullness thereof god bless you tonight we'll sing a song i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the pilgrim way for the hand of god and all my life i see and the reason of my bliss yes the secret all is this that the comforter abideth in me he abides he
