[14:46] so there's many sicknesses among us this
[14:49] morning you reach down and touch each
[14:51] one as the word goes forth we love you
[14:54] and we thank you in Jesus name Amen
[14:59] so we go to first Peter we read this
[15:03] because that we're tying it in as one
[15:07] thing of being born again something has
[15:10] taken place now I wish we would I'll try
[15:15] to repeat it a little bit in a minute
[15:17] but see I believe what makes this
[15:21] message hard for people to follow is
[15:25] that it covers such a large area all
[15:30] right and it covers to Israel it covers
[15:34] to the bride it covers a large area and
[15:37] you get a tall reading it and mingle it
[15:41] together without having it you know
[15:45] understanding then it makes it confusing
[15:48] a lot of times when you read the Bible
[15:51] and you wonder we'll watch this or
[15:53] what's it talking about who's it talking
[15:54] to whatever and all and it may
[15:57] it confusing and see that way it has to
[16:02] be revealed so we break it down go see
[16:06] the Bible is written the Prophet said
[16:08] that all scripture and things are
[16:10] compound meaning and compound revelation
[16:13] see like he brought his son out of Egypt
[16:15] all right which was Israel coming out of
[16:18] Egypt then Jesus comes out of Egypt all
[16:21] right compound meaning with that way
[16:24] then by having a compound meaning if you
[16:27] don't get it applied to which way like
[16:31] for instance I remember like the second
[16:34] coming of Jesus Christ see you got it to
[16:37] the bride you got it to Israel you got
[16:39] it to the Millennium you've got a whole
[16:41] bunch of things that are related to the
[16:44] second coming of Jesus Christ
[16:46] and if you get those scriptures you know
[16:49] and read them and don't understand how
[16:51] they're placed then surely it is
[16:55] confusing to read the Bible and say well
[16:59] now what is this what is that let's see
[17:01] if you'll just go read the before and
[17:04] the after
[17:05] if you'll just simply sit down and look
[17:08] and see what it's a talking about then
[17:12] you'll have it in the correct order you
[17:15] know like we say that but run said to
[17:17] our English language the messed up with
[17:19] a word board you know you say come on
[17:21] board stand on board cause on board
[17:23] that's three different ways of looking
[17:25] at one word but if you take the before
[17:29] and the after to understand it you say
[17:32] come on board that means you're
[17:34] directing to come on board like a ship
[17:36] or something stand on this board you're
[17:38] specifically telling what the board is
[17:40] it's a plank guy and then it says
[17:43] because I'm bored with you now you
[17:45] understand by the before and the after
[17:48] of what it is well that's what it is
[17:51] with me and the Bible in see then I'll
[17:54] repeat this but I want this up here see
[17:57] this stature of a perfect man it's not
[18:01] just to try to tell us how to be born
[18:03] again it's the entire growth of the
[18:07] individual all the way through life
[18:11] and goes all the way to the chains of
[18:13] the body all right see then to take this
[18:17] over here and put it over here what have
[18:20] you doing
[18:20] and see I'm trying to lay it down to
[18:24] where that everything will stay in order
[18:27] and that way we can follow the line up
[18:32] all right see that's why I keep reading
[18:34] the same scriptures and things to where
[18:38] that we can get an understanding okay
[18:40] now we go to verse 18 the first Peter
[18:44] for as much as you know you were not
[18:47] redeemed with corruptible things as
[18:50] silver and gold from your vain
[18:52] conversation received by tradition from
[18:56] your father's but with the precious
[18:59] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[19:01] blemish and without spot Hoover Lee was
[19:04] foreordained before the foundation of
[19:06] the world but was manifest in these last
[19:08] times to you who by him do believe in
[19:12] God that raised him up from the dead and
[19:16] gave him glory that your faith and hope
[19:20] might be in God seeing you have purified
[19:23] your souls in obeying the truth through
[19:25] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[19:27] Brethren see that you love one another
[19:29] with a pure heart fervently once done
[19:32] being born again now what is the new
[19:37] birth the new birth is a birth of the
[19:41] word right now read it right now there
[19:44] is the thing you say well brother that
[19:47] why will you hammer so much that the new
[19:49] birth is a birth of the word because
[19:51] that's what it is
[19:52] Oh what I don't need you're not in not
[19:57] doing you're not listening you're
[19:59] wanting into something in your ways to
[20:01] do it I'm talking about what the Bible
[20:03] says so read it right there from the
[20:05] Bible being born again not of
[20:10] corruptible seed so now Nicodemus was
[20:15] right when he said it would it do any
[20:17] good for me to go to my mother's wound
[20:19] and come back out if you're telling me
[20:22] that was corrupt and I'd do it again how
[20:24] would it help me
[20:25] so listen to it being born to get not of
[20:30] corruptible seed but of incorruptible
[20:34] now what he explains what incorruptible
[20:37] is and what he's home by the Word of God
[20:41] which liveth and about us forever so
[20:44] what is the new birth it's not the
[20:49] corruptible things it's the Word of God
[20:52] that is uncorruptible you know our
[20:55] incorruptible ever how you want to bring
[20:57] the the thought all right and see your
[20:59] being born again which means something
[21:02] is taking place the child is growing up
[21:06] all right so then the whole thing of the
[21:09] Bible is to not to just tell us his
[21:13] weight is bringing out in the seals and
[21:14] it's not to just tell us that we need to
[21:17] be born again that's wonderful that's
[21:20] great that's where you start out but it
[21:25] tells you your whole life your journey
[21:28] and on into the change of the body see
[21:33] right in the very word of God the
[21:35] scriptures that we read now let's read
[21:37] from Ephesians then we'll go back to 2nd
[21:40] Peter so we're going to Ephesians 4
[21:43] verse 8 wherefore said he when he
[21:49] ascended up on high and let that
[21:51] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[21:54] men now he that ascended what is it but
[21:58] that he also descended first into the
[22:02] lower part of the earth so that's what
[22:03] Christ had to come and docume alright he
[22:07] that descended is the same also that
[22:09] ascended up far above all heavens that
[22:12] he might fill all things now what did he
[22:15] say in verse 8 and gave gifts unto men
[22:19] now what gifts here's a before and after
[22:26] what gifts is he talking about what he's
[22:30] talking about tongues speaking at all
[22:31] shouting glory and Allah is that what he
[22:35] says here
[22:38] alright verse eight and he gave gifts
[22:41] unto me and it tells about him ascending
[22:43] and descending you know and look and he
[22:46] gave some apostles and some prophets and
[22:50] some evangelists some pastors and
[22:52] teachers what for for the perfecting of
[22:55] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[22:58] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[23:00] till we all come into the unity of the
[23:03] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[23:06] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[23:09] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[23:15] now Paul uses stature Paul uses coming
[23:22] to a measure do it but he's not talking
[23:26] about physically growing all right now
[23:31] he's talking about spiritually growing
[23:33] Peter doesn't use the word stature in
[23:37] all of his writings he doesn't use the
[23:39] word stature but that's what he's
[23:41] talking about
[23:41] right see Paul is saying the end - we
[23:45] all come into the unity of the faith and
[23:47] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[23:49] perfect man unto the measure of the
[23:52] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[23:54] we henceforth be no more children see
[23:57] you want to grow up right why or you
[23:59] won't be children tossed to and fro and
[24:02] carried about with every wind of
[24:04] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[24:06] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[24:09] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[24:13] in love may grow up into him in all
[24:21] things which is the head even Christ you
[24:25] may be seated
[24:26] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[24:28] of the word and you understand what I'm
[24:31] saying that the Bible is written not to
[24:40] just get us born again that's wonderful
[24:44] that's the beginning that's the point
[24:47] that we need to follow in it's trying to
[24:50] tell us how to be born again
[24:51] right but then the Bible is telling you
[24:55] about the growth development and how you
[25:00] grow up and how you do this and how
[25:02] everything happens it's explaining those
[25:05] things to the tea to us and like I said
[25:09] then Paul uses the word stature but a
[25:15] Branham uses the word stature in the
[25:16] statue of a perfect man and he uses he
[25:19] quotes the scripture but he doesn't take
[25:22] it and read it as a point and bring it
[25:25] out but he uses the word the scripture
[25:27] that I just read in the stature of a
[25:30] perfect man you may heard me the other
[25:32] day say Paul didn't you appeared in uses
[25:35] over here you know in his duties doesn't
[25:37] but he's telling you how to do it he's
[25:41] telling you how to come to the stature
[25:44] of a perfect man all right now in that
[25:50] Peter is laying down the way Paul tells
[25:55] you how we need to come to that we'll
[25:59] get to those later on adoption when he
[26:02] comes in to the child being a child and
[26:05] then tutored and and brought into the
[26:07] stature our growth development and look
[26:11] up that word stature it means Heights it
[26:14] means like growing it means like things
[26:16] like that but it also means maturity
[26:22] maturity is your greater understanding
[26:26] of the word stature it means maturity
[26:30] that have our sister with us glad it's
[26:33] gonna be with us today
[26:34] all right the stature then the height
[26:38] the growth development not of an
[26:40] individual it is Christ within us
[26:46] growing up that we may grow up in him
[26:50] and who is he he's the word as I said
[26:54] when we started there one the new birth
[26:57] what is it's the birth of the word you
[27:02] heard the word you accepted to work
[27:04] you you saw the work the word said for
[27:07] you to do the word said Nate when they
[27:09] ask him what must we do to be saved
[27:11] then they said repent every one of you
[27:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[27:15] the remission of sins and you shall
[27:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right
[27:18] in - they answered it was scripturally
[27:20] all right
[27:21] because what is the birth being born
[27:24] again not of anything corruptible it
[27:28] wouldn't do no good Nicodemus knew that
[27:32] Nicodemus is a city with Jesus
[27:34] it ain't written out as - we read but
[27:39] yet they didn't have a five-minute
[27:41] conversation there was maybe hours of
[27:44] discussing the thing and Nicodemus knew
[27:47] what Peter I mean what Jesus was saying
[27:51] the Jew did you need to be born again so
[27:56] then he brings it up with would it do
[27:57] any good for me to go back to my
[27:59] mother's womb no because you're saying
[28:03] that I've born wrong because I need to
[28:07] be born again all right
[28:09] why would he tell him he need to be born
[28:11] again if he wouldn't tell him it's more
[28:13] wrong if he said you had born right your
[28:17] lineage is right everything's ok we're
[28:18] on our way to heaven
[28:19] no he didn't tell him that it's not
[28:22] written out we read the Bible as to
[28:25] understanding what God is bringing to us
[28:29] that way we take the before the after
[28:32] the entire word we bring it together and
[28:35] we can see where it fits together in a
[28:39] beautiful picture all right so as I said
[28:42] then I've been over and over it two or
[28:45] three times to the message and then
[28:48] we'll get back and try to put it
[28:49] together into one thing but Peter is
[28:53] telling you how to come to where he was
[28:57] at Paul is telling you what you would be
[29:01] when you get that Paul describes the
[29:05] full growth of a son and child of God
[29:07] adoption bringing it into being brings
[29:11] us to the stature of Jesus Christ
[29:14] because it's not the stature of me and
[29:16] you
[29:17] it's the statue of Jesus Christ in you
[29:20] and me that's what Peter is explaining
[29:23] to them alright so then in doing that it
[29:28] comes forth to be a beautiful picture of
[29:31] the entire Bible showing us that you
[29:37] know who you know you go to do a lot of
[29:40] places today in this world what do we
[29:42] need to know all of this about we just
[29:43] need to be saved I don't care about this
[29:48] or what I'm gonna have when I'm getting
[29:49] heaven I just want to get to heaven well
[29:54] how you gonna get to have them if you
[29:55] don't know how may I quote the Prophet
[29:59] did the Prophet I'll give you a quote
[30:01] here while back he said out what good
[30:03] would need about the Holy Ghost if you
[30:05] don't know what it is her phrasing it
[30:10] but it's close
[30:10] what good is it if we don't know what it
[30:13] is he said it's been so misunderstood so
[30:16] much the Holy Ghost has missed out until
[30:20] we don't even know how to place it all
[30:23] right what you see then if we take it to
[30:27] what he's trying to get us to say okay
[30:32] and we listen to it in the right way
[30:36] then we be able to follow what is being
[30:40] said right because you know but a random
[30:47] talks about well let's just go the way I
[30:49] said I'd go in my minds okay
[30:51] I had to change things around wala going
[30:54] in everything because you know I needed
[30:58] to express something through you so go
[31:01] ahead and our brothers and pull that up
[31:02] on on the second Peter I had this
[31:05] schedule to read before receipted but I
[31:08] wanted it to to be worth it you would
[31:11] think about it I wanted to emphasize
[31:14] each scripture to were you would think
[31:20] about what is being said and how far
[31:24] that we've come into what we're doing
[31:27] all right now remember the pole
[31:31] Paul is explaining the measure the
[31:37] height the stature that not how tall you
[31:40] are but what you are in Christ he goes
[31:44] into Romans and explaining adoption how
[31:48] a child is a charming Galatians and you
[31:51] know how the child is a child now that
[31:57] then like we talked about last Sunday
[31:58] there one a babies born with ever part
[32:01] normal baby born with ever part that'll
[32:04] ever how it's born with everything
[32:06] you'll ever need it just needs a growth
[32:08] development all right here comes brother
[32:11] Branham now look people in to match
[32:13] their quote I got a quote brother
[32:15] Branham that when I got born again I got
[32:17] everything I needed
[32:19] we don't want that's a direct quote
[32:21] that's exactly what he said verbatim
[32:24] word for work that sounds like a bad
[32:29] doctrine um once saved always
[32:30] saved got everything but that's right a
[32:34] babies got everything that it needs when
[32:40] it's more that's born with everything it
[32:42] needs what does it need to do eat what
[32:47] does a Christian need to do eat the Word
[32:49] of God and grow in that word until we
[32:53] become that word any problem we see it
[32:58] simple if we take it but I've got quote
[33:00] you can't tell me I'm born again but I'm
[33:05] not trying to I'm trying my best to tell
[33:08] you and me what we need to have it's up
[33:12] to you to find out whether you're right
[33:14] or not all right but listen let's look
[33:17] at the scripture we've been reading a
[33:19] lot and emphasized just a little bit on
[33:23] each part so he says in 2nd Peter now
[33:28] like I said 1st Peter he tells you you
[33:31] need to be you know you you're born here
[33:33] you need to be born again you need to
[33:35] come into Christ you need to grow
[33:36] development and being warned against a
[33:38] cut Peter he begins to tell you
[33:41] now who's he telling
[33:43] listen Simon Peter servant an apostle of
[33:46] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[33:49] like precious faith with us through the
[33:51] righteousness of God and our Savior all
[33:53] right this is not written a prophet said
[33:55] it's in a message factual perfectly this
[33:58] is not written to the world this is
[34:01] written to those that are in Christ
[34:03] because unless you're in Christ you
[34:06] can't understand anything about the
[34:08] righteousness of Jesus Chrysler and
[34:10] whatever one because no man can call
[34:13] Jesus the Christ whaat
[34:14] except it be by an inward dwelling of
[34:17] the Holy Spirit just not so you're
[34:23] saying what somebody else says you're
[34:26] just reading the Bible Ariza all right
[34:28] but he says what now to them that have
[34:31] obtained like pressure in other words he
[34:33] said I've got this I've got this
[34:37] experience of salvation and I'm trying
[34:41] to tell you how to see that if you have
[34:46] that same experience then we have like
[34:51] precious faith see if you're born again
[34:57] we have like precious who is it written
[35:00] to all right who is the Bible written to
[35:04] to those that are in Christ Jesus
[35:06] how do we get into Christ Jesus by one
[35:09] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[35:11] all right so then were we a see to them
[35:16] he's not talking to the world he's
[35:18] talking to them that are already in
[35:21] Christ Jesus by the new birth you must
[35:28] first what the prophets say have faith
[35:30] and be born again all right now you're
[35:35] supposed to read the message okay now
[35:37] listen but watch what he goes to say
[35:39] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[35:42] through the knowledge of God and Jesus
[35:44] our Lord now like I said if he's not
[35:47] talking to people with the new birth why
[35:49] is he talking about the Grace and peace
[35:50] multiplied through the knowledge of God
[35:52] you just have human knowledge but if you
[35:56] got the baptism with a
[35:57] the ghosts you have the inside teacher
[36:00] right all right and that's who he's
[36:03] talking to
[36:04] so then what am I talking to today now
[36:07] listen won't say I'm talking to those
[36:09] that say they have the new birth to
[36:12] those that don't have the new birth the
[36:14] order is open that's all you can
[36:17] understand head knowledge you get it all
[36:21] blowed up and thought and you get and
[36:23] think you got everything but no man can
[36:25] call Jesus Christ unless he's got that
[36:27] new birth in his soul to tell him what
[36:32] it is all right then what now look hey
[36:36] he's going according as his divine power
[36:38] have given unto us all things that
[36:42] pertain unto life and godliness
[36:44] we got everything glory we got all
[36:47] things amen but we need a growth
[36:52] development right according to His
[36:58] divine power given unto us all things
[37:00] that pertain to life and godliness
[37:02] through the knowledge of him that called
[37:05] us to glory and virtue now brother what
[37:12] made a statement years ago and he never
[37:14] did preach it he said one of these days
[37:18] don't want to preach about glory and
[37:22] virtue well what does that mean glory
[37:30] and virtue
[37:30] now the word virtue here as a basic
[37:38] different meaning the word Verte than
[37:40] the Virts word virtue when the Prophet
[37:42] says add to your faith virtue because
[37:47] this virtue here means a Christian life
[37:50] to be lived and manifested outwardly
[37:54] whereas the one in the statue of a
[37:57] perfect man your prophet said it he said
[38:00] it means strength or power and that's
[38:04] the same thing is in Luke so you go over
[38:07] and Luke and Matthew where Jesus said
[38:10] stray
[38:11] has gone out of me in other words I've
[38:12] got weakened that means he got
[38:14] physically weak power had went out all
[38:19] right but look he's cut work hard now
[38:21] what's what I'm getting that only those
[38:25] that enter Christ only those that are in
[38:30] Christ sealed in the Christ by the
[38:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost can know and
[38:35] see the knowledge of God and follow him
[38:39] through the word because whether you're
[38:41] gonna say what somebody else says and
[38:43] that's all you're doing all right now
[38:46] then it comes down to showing His divine
[38:48] power he's making sure it's gonna work
[38:50] and what he's doing he's have called us
[38:55] to glory and virtue he realized now
[39:04] listen you realize that ever born-again
[39:10] believer is called to glory and virtue
[39:16] ever born-again believer is called to
[39:21] glory and virtue the glory to the fact
[39:26] of being in God and virture to the point
[39:30] of the Christian life being lived all
[39:33] right now are you listening ever
[39:36] born-again believer is called to glory
[39:39] and virtue right but that just starts
[39:48] you burn now when we drop on down to the
[39:54] virtue part in the statue of a perfect
[39:56] man you see it picks up because you see
[39:59] only those who can follow into the end
[40:03] time the message of the hour can
[40:10] understand what glory and virtue really
[40:14] is because else you're going to read
[40:17] words
[40:23] come on because in second Peter where it
[40:28] says virtue that definition is the same
[40:35] definition is it says when it says Adam
[40:38] to your faith virtue which means a
[40:49] Christian life now the Prophet said the
[40:54] word virtue when he's used it in the
[40:56] statute of a perfect man of coming on
[40:58] over to add to your faith virtue he said
[41:01] that's not a virgin life he said that's
[41:04] not what he's talking about he's telling
[41:12] you a different definition for the word
[41:14] than even the strongest concordance will
[41:19] give you a definition go Strong's
[41:21] Concordance will give you a definition
[41:23] of virtue that's virtually there in
[41:26] second Peter now listen I say that to
[41:31] make you stop long enough to think just
[41:35] a little bit but then you start running
[41:38] on out and miss what I'm talking about
[41:42] ever born-again believer is called to
[41:46] God's glory and God's virtue to live a
[41:49] virgin
[41:49] virtuous life a Christian life brother
[41:56] branham never had to come to tell us it
[41:59] was wrong to drink and run around with
[42:01] women and cuss and snort and do it all
[42:04] of those things once what they hope but
[42:06] brother brown told her he didn't have to
[42:09] tell it he didn't have to tell me that I
[42:11] had to put up the pastor fence when L
[42:13] could I let the cow get out but yet you
[42:17] read it said well I found out I should
[42:19] have put that since I didn't have no
[42:21] thoughts about putting the fence back up
[42:23] if that got tore down I put it up why
[42:26] because I was gonna get today life beat
[42:28] out of me when I got home and then I
[42:30] have to go put the cow up put the fence
[42:32] up but around them didn't have to tell
[42:34] me
[42:36] then it was wrong to lie cheat and steal
[42:39] and commit adultery and all I can but
[42:44] the people to this message just like
[42:45] they didn't know nothing until run
[42:47] around and told us run around told us
[42:49] run around told if you had Karl to glory
[42:55] in verse you buy the new birth
[42:58] there's no excuse to come along and say
[43:01] well brother bream told us we didn't
[43:03] need to do this not like I I think we
[43:04] need to quit doing that you mean it was
[43:08] all right to lying cheating stealing and
[43:10] all like that commit adultery and all
[43:12] before the Prophet came but then when he
[43:16] comes and reminded us of it we decided
[43:18] to quit and think it's he's it's God
[43:20] telling us more to quit it now the new
[43:22] birth like wage saying the seals is not
[43:30] to bring you a new birth the new birth
[43:37] is supposed to be the birth in Christ
[43:38] that's what I've been driving at
[43:40] hammering at for weeks now on one thing
[43:43] the new birth and what is it it's the
[43:46] person of the word we just read by the
[43:49] incorruptible Word and when you come to
[43:55] incorruptible Word and get a new birth
[43:58] you have a portion of those virtues
[44:02] dwelling within you just like a baby has
[44:06] a portion of its life within it it just
[44:10] has to grow up into being able to be
[44:14] used and dies right but listen everybody
[44:24] is called that's born again it's called
[44:28] the glory and virtue we should have
[44:34] known all along it was wrong to do the
[44:37] effort don't do it but a run said you
[44:41] don't have to tell people that's wrong
[44:43] to commit adultery
[44:48] yeah but we didn't know it was wrong to
[44:51] do this and I did so we went and done it
[44:54] now you're a liar is that strong enough
[44:58] your own conscience let you know it was
[45:01] wrong you just didn't have nothin to
[45:06] condemn you with one of these days I'll
[45:09] get around to preaching one of the law
[45:11] was given you know what was given to
[45:13] condemn you
[45:15] you know what the letter of this message
[45:18] does condemns you it kills you but we
[45:26] didn't have to have that well I didn't
[45:29] know it was wrong to cuss now come on
[45:34] folks
[45:35] I see people using little words you know
[45:41] a lot of times oh they don't cuss but
[45:45] they get so close to it until it's
[45:48] amazing until when I look up the word of
[45:51] the dictionary it spelled it saying well
[45:59] they don't bother me to say and I'll say
[46:02] it or that you'll know what I'm talking
[46:04] about because a lot of people are a lot
[46:08] of people claim they don't know I've
[46:10] heard a lot of you say burn when
[46:12] something would go wrong no I don't know
[46:16] how to even spell that do you are in or
[46:18] out it is I just know it's a bad word
[46:20] for me we wouldn't talk to use them kind
[46:23] of words right come on you hit your
[46:32] finger and you you blurt out little
[46:34] things but you don't oh no no no I
[46:36] didn't say I didn't I didn't cuss I got
[46:41] close I don't like to use that word D
[46:49] a.m. I know what it means downer to hold
[46:53] the water but I know what people use it
[46:56] for
[47:01] it's a slang word what do you need a
[47:06] slang word for you hit your finger while
[47:09] I wrap this say Oh best thing to do
[47:19] stick it in your mouth you know why cuz
[47:22] it's just a mouth up from saying them
[47:23] words and you suck on it a little bit
[47:27] and it'll quit hurting come on church
[47:30] talking about Christianity that we think
[47:34] we've had to wait til the Prophet come
[47:35] to tell us it was wrong
[47:38] we were already
[47:42] what was the word what word you used for
[47:44] in other words we had a TV and
[47:46] everything we come into message would
[47:47] you know what we'd already started
[47:49] telling the kids things they couldn't
[47:51] watch never heard of the Prophet never
[48:01] heard of it we'd already started
[48:04] programming our kids to those things oh
[48:09] yeah we had a Christmas tree oh yeah
[48:13] well we'd already started telling them
[48:16] what was wrong
[48:18] that was for we heard of the Prophet
[48:20] probably didn't have to come tell me not
[48:23] to cuss or to lie or to cheat is that
[48:30] what you think he came for now the new
[48:36] bird folks take care of those signs well
[48:39] because we're called of glory and virtue
[48:45] we're called to live a virtuous life but
[48:53] it don't bother me to do this act well
[48:55] then maybe you need to get a good
[48:57] salvation well you can't find word a
[49:00] prophet said it I remember one time I
[49:03] say this is kind of funny but he was
[49:05] coming along into the message part and I
[49:08] had an old flattop haircut you know
[49:11] brother mode he had here
[49:13] it was kind of round and it was already
[49:15] starting coming out you know
[49:16] so here's wasn't necessary that stand up
[49:19] flat top in somebody said something bad
[49:23] to preach the message you know about him
[49:24] them fellers for them flat top haircuts
[49:27] and brother mode he said one day he's
[49:30] you know out shirts and starts brother
[49:32] there he said I ain't found a thing
[49:33] brother Brennan said about a flattop I
[49:35] said I searched it all
[49:36] I said because this is the haircut I
[49:43] wore all my life I mean it I've had a
[49:46] flat top I said now I don't have the
[49:48] duck tail Elvis Presley you know or some
[49:52] of them I didn't I didn't have enough
[49:54] iron to do it all back and make a good
[49:58] duck tail we didn't worry them in our
[50:00] day but we just wore flat old flattop
[50:04] you know right well well we found where
[50:10] the Prophet said you don't need the
[50:14] Prophet to live a Christian life
[50:16] if you gotta have the Prophet to make
[50:20] you to live a Christian life you need to
[50:22] get born again that's as plain as I can
[50:25] say it we never miss church when we were
[50:34] in the Baptist ain't got a thing in the
[50:39] world about people going on vacations
[50:41] everybody needs something ain't saying a
[50:45] word about it you say you aren't I'll
[50:48] tell you you're a liar to your face will
[50:49] face god I never said a thing about
[50:52] people with their vacations but now when
[50:54] you get back in from your vote vacation
[50:58] on Friday evening and you too lazy to
[51:01] come Church on Sunday morning I mean
[51:03] Saturday evening and you can't make it a
[51:05] church on Sunday then you are lazy they
[51:08] something wrong with you you ought to be
[51:11] at church you come in early enough to
[51:13] get your you certainly ain't gonna come
[51:15] in Sunday and miss Monday because that's
[51:18] work day oh I didn't this was not meant
[51:23] to be okay
[51:25] alright I'll change in a second but let
[51:27] me get to thought off what does it mean
[51:29] to be called a glory and virtue ever
[51:33] born-again believer or to be called a
[51:35] glory and virtue ever born-again
[51:37] believer or to have an inward dwelling
[51:39] or have to have one to be a Christian
[51:41] and then we're dwelling of Jesus Christ
[51:44] and all like that that's the new birth
[51:48] that's the being born again because now
[51:52] start being born again with a 2-foot to
[51:54] four fold out what being born again the
[51:57] day you receive the baptism in the Holy
[51:59] Ghost
[51:59] you're being born again but then you
[52:01] start a growth development that goes
[52:03] through your Christian journey of being
[52:05] born again as you eat the word right we
[52:14] see we're all called to glory and virtue
[52:17] we're all called to live a Christian
[52:20] life
[52:24] okay look whereby are given unto us
[52:30] exceeding great and precious promises
[52:34] they'll run said down by these promises
[52:36] these always emphasize that right that
[52:39] by these you might want be partakers of
[52:42] the divine nature having escaped the
[52:45] corruption that is in the world through
[52:47] lust
[52:47] now last Sunday we were preaching on the
[52:50] divine nature the Wrentham covers your
[52:54] divine nature I gave you a bunch I still
[52:57] have a bunch laying here if you want
[52:59] your divine nature is in a two-part
[53:01] thing when you're born again a babe in
[53:05] Christ you take his nature because
[53:10] that's the divine nature that comes in
[53:12] to drive out that unclean spirit right
[53:15] your new birth is the divine nature
[53:18] right it's the nature of God to come in
[53:23] to live and drive out all of the things
[53:25] that Satan had left in us but see then
[53:32] going into a growth development from
[53:35] that into a divine nature
[53:43] so then the profit gets over in the
[53:47] message he's talking about the divine
[53:49] nature we'll read these if you want them
[53:51] he's talking about how he's addressing
[53:53] this to the church those that are in
[53:54] Christ Jesus and that divine nature is
[53:57] the divine nature of you partaking of
[54:01] that divine nature these mortal body now
[54:08] that we can be protected he said these
[54:14] mortal bodies you know this outside
[54:18] don't act unless the inside tells it to
[54:23] their will to be concerned about that
[54:25] but look when he gets over to the
[54:28] message the position of a believer in
[54:30] Christ which is on the own adoption he
[54:34] said after coming into the body we are
[54:40] to be partakers of the divine nature do
[54:44] you understand what I was getting that
[54:45] last Sunday when you're born again that
[54:50] soul is as pure and clean and eternal as
[54:55] it ever will be you don't grow in
[54:58] eternity eternity pushes outward through
[55:02] the rest of us to bring into
[55:04] manifestation all right so when you're
[55:07] born again you're a partaker of his
[55:09] divine nature but then to compare that
[55:17] divine nature as a growth development
[55:19] you're like the sister was in the in the
[55:23] dream on blasphemous names that she
[55:25] didn't know the way brother branham was
[55:27] preaching it she didn't know whether she
[55:29] had to hold a ghost or not you remember
[55:31] that we'll get back to that message she
[55:35] didn't know she was concerned because
[55:40] she didn't know what because he's
[55:42] preaching the divine nature he's
[55:45] preaching through the statue of a
[55:46] perfect man a divine nature
[55:51] and speaking of the fact of a new birth
[55:53] the new birth is to bring you in either
[55:59] divine nature you can't have God coming
[56:06] and living in your soul and your old
[56:08] nature still dire the unclean spirit was
[56:14] driven out at sanctification when I talk
[56:18] about body and spirit we're talking
[56:19] about the soul the soul is where the new
[56:22] birth takes place it doesn't take place
[56:24] in your body in your spirit
[56:26] that isn't how it would work from the
[56:28] inside to come out and control the
[56:31] outside and it's the divine nature of
[56:35] Almighty God that's why brother Branham
[56:37] is so missed confused and misunderstood
[56:40] he's speaking of a divine nature and
[56:42] bringing it up here - a hot development
[56:45] of a growth development in Christ that
[56:47] means a Christian that has walked in
[56:49] Christ a long time and it's partaker of
[56:52] that divine nature but then he's
[56:54] explaining at the same time that there
[56:57] was the divine nature that come into you
[56:59] the day you was born again it made you a
[57:01] baby in Christ there's any problem with
[57:06] that but that's what makes the message
[57:10] confusing so I've got a quote you just
[57:17] killing yourself without those things
[57:21] coming together but when he gets over
[57:25] there in a position in Christ which is
[57:28] actually preached with for the statute
[57:31] of perfect man was positioning Christ
[57:33] preaching 55
[57:36] he is already speaking of a divine
[57:39] nature that after you're born again go
[57:46] back to 1955 interval and listen to him
[57:51] talk about he said a living
[57:54] instrumentality of Christian God walking
[57:57] into feet in human beings
[58:00] he was already preaching that he was
[58:04] preaching that all the way
[58:05] down through there that's why the people
[58:09] couldn't understand him look the lady
[58:13] said I don't listen to you brother on
[58:16] him and it sounded exactly like brother
[58:19] branham preached in a lot of time that
[58:21] you don't have nothing right but then
[58:28] he's telling you that we're Christians
[58:30] being partakers of the divine nature
[58:34] he's one of us trying to go grow into
[58:39] I'm quoting from statue of perfect man
[58:42] how that we must be protectors of His
[58:45] divine nature now each one of us are
[58:47] trying to grow into the stature of God
[58:55] then that's where people don't
[58:56] understand him Godfrey's I'm saying that
[58:58] I didn't that's were in you hearing him
[59:02] expressing things and you hear him
[59:06] describing and it sounds like one time
[59:09] he's talking about the new birth next
[59:11] time he's talking about a group
[59:13] development in height than Christ and
[59:16] the human mind has trouble bringing
[59:19] those things together and see you talk
[59:25] about a divine nature and you talk about
[59:30] getting it to a place that you don't
[59:32] have no more troubles
[59:36] you know how troubles live in a
[59:38] Christian life and then you turn around
[59:42] said what brother Dale I'm having
[59:43] trouble it sounds like the Prophet says
[59:46] I'm not born again
[59:53] right sounds like he's saying it I'm not
[59:57] born again that was what was wrong with
[59:59] the sister she was so concerned she
[1:00:02] thought that maybe she wasn't even born
[1:00:04] in one because of the way that he was
[1:00:11] preaching it and we know that we have
[1:00:19] been told at least they taught it coming
[1:00:23] down through in some ways that the
[1:00:25] Christian life was to be controlling the
[1:00:28] individual the Christian life is cool
[1:00:34] controlling the individual until we even
[1:00:39] condemn ourselves for the least little
[1:00:40] thing you remember that let's see then
[1:00:48] we turn around on the other side of the
[1:00:50] scale and we talk about coming to
[1:00:52] temperance and read about them catch the
[1:00:54] temperance and he starts talking about
[1:00:59] how you still got a little too well you
[1:01:06] got one side telling you you ain't got
[1:01:08] nothing you got those that looks like
[1:01:10] you can just get by with anything that's
[1:01:15] why it's hard to preach a Christian life
[1:01:18] because of the way we've been taught it
[1:01:24] the way we've been taught all we need to
[1:01:26] do just come to our door and cried and
[1:01:28] accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and
[1:01:29] walk back off an in water try to live if
[1:01:32] we can then if we don't we don't make it
[1:01:39] you know what would come back we're you
[1:01:42] say something buddy you think you
[1:01:44] perfect you never had that throw do you
[1:01:48] phase and you start talking about
[1:01:51] Christianity and so much you think you
[1:01:53] perfect ain't none of us perfect
[1:01:55] we all have problems just a second or
[1:01:56] two before then they was as perfect as
[1:01:58] they could be right now that do you
[1:02:05] understand what I'm getting at
[1:02:07] we're all called of glory and virtue
[1:02:11] we're called to live a Christian life
[1:02:15] we're also called to a growth
[1:02:17] development in Christ that is to bring
[1:02:22] out the things and get rid of that other
[1:02:24] part of that nature of us see our nature
[1:02:27] is in our body our spirit and our soul
[1:02:30] as a sinner that nature is the nature of
[1:02:34] the devil called the Adamic nature of
[1:02:37] mankind right you get what I said when
[1:02:40] we're babies before you born again that
[1:02:43] nature that we have in our body is just
[1:02:46] a display of what our spirit is and the
[1:02:48] Spirit is a display of what's in our
[1:02:50] soul so we've got the whole nature to be
[1:02:56] dealing with right and salvation is us
[1:03:03] trying to explain Sunday what you repent
[1:03:08] of your sins why cause you're condemned
[1:03:11] for living wrong and doing wrong you
[1:03:13] repent
[1:03:14] that's justification that's taking out
[1:03:17] that thing of sin that was in our lives
[1:03:22] we say oh look said when when I when I
[1:03:25] got saved I felt so good I said now why
[1:03:29] do I feel so bad I always felt so
[1:03:34] wonderful there now I feel bad because
[1:03:40] justification only chops off you
[1:03:43] Pisceans it does nothing to the nature
[1:03:46] of mankind sanctification starts dealing
[1:03:50] in the nature of man and that's in his
[1:03:53] soul it's the soul that's part of
[1:03:55] repenting but we do a lot of Wrath in
[1:03:57] here oh you know they say the talk is
[1:04:05] cheap unless you hire a lawyer but you
[1:04:10] know it's cheap to say are easy to say
[1:04:13] I'm sorry we teach our children go tell
[1:04:16] them you're sorry
[1:04:17] well it's good I mean on well now I'm
[1:04:19] not going on
[1:04:21] tell you wrong now but I'm just telling
[1:04:23] you you tell the kid to go you go tell
[1:04:26] that person you're sorry come on you
[1:04:34] didn't do it yourself so don't look at
[1:04:37] me when you were told to go say I'm
[1:04:41] sorry you didn't mean it
[1:04:43] oh yes I did you didn't mean it you got
[1:04:52] caught you had to go apologize
[1:04:54] biggest portion of people's apology has
[1:04:57] no more meaning than a word I'm sorry
[1:05:05] I've always tried my best to teach you
[1:05:07] you know don't tell your children God
[1:05:11] don't want you to do them thing now you
[1:05:13] go apologize don't read it don't make
[1:05:16] God in between these tell them to go
[1:05:18] pologize cuz we dollar most bank you
[1:05:26] well how many kids run over and
[1:05:28] apologize because they know they're
[1:05:31] gonna get a whoopin if they didn't right
[1:05:36] okay we live human but see a lot of our
[1:05:42] repentance means nothing I like what the
[1:05:47] Bible says there's a repentance that
[1:05:49] need not to be repented of do you need
[1:05:52] that scripture that there's a repentance
[1:05:54] that need not to be repented of what
[1:05:56] does that mean a repentance that need
[1:05:59] not to be repented of it simply means
[1:06:04] you need to repent from something
[1:06:09] controlling you from the inside instead
[1:06:12] of I'm sorry now come on kids you know
[1:06:16] it and come on adults you live the same
[1:06:19] life and you know I'm telling the truth
[1:06:22] you wouldn't sincere when you apologized
[1:06:28] come on get over and let's live right
[1:06:30] and get straight
[1:06:32] you wouldn't apologize and you'd
[1:06:34] apologize cause you got cold you know
[1:06:36] that's the problem with a lot of people
[1:06:38] their apology comes because of getting
[1:06:41] caught how many of them apologizes for
[1:06:44] they get caught no I got a lot of that
[1:06:51] didn't you but see Christian life is
[1:06:55] were called a glory and virtue we're all
[1:06:58] called to live a Christian life just at
[1:07:01] your new birth you're called to live a
[1:07:02] Christian life let's say brother Branham
[1:07:07] didn't have to tell us it was wrong to
[1:07:09] commit adultery you know what he had to
[1:07:14] tell us about that
[1:07:15] now come on he had to come tell us him
[1:07:20] denomination and them people back there
[1:07:22] that told us about this that and the
[1:07:24] other about adultery was wrong right
[1:07:28] come on
[1:07:29] are you with me are you winning this
[1:07:33] then he didn't have to tell us it was
[1:07:37] wrong to do them things he told us we
[1:07:40] was wrong we listened to what others
[1:07:42] told us it was all right to do them
[1:07:43] right and it made us come - come on in
[1:07:50] Ruth let us come to a basis that we just
[1:07:52] live like the devil and put it up or I
[1:07:54] couldn't help it that was my nature it
[1:07:56] made me do that well some were in a line
[1:08:00] somewhere in man there's a way of
[1:08:03] getting rid of a nature and I thought
[1:08:08] we've called to do that we're called to
[1:08:13] be Christians was called to live for God
[1:08:19] that's what he wanted us to do was to
[1:08:23] live for him all right call the glory
[1:08:27] and virtue call to be a Christian the
[1:08:32] Neuberger calls us to this be this the
[1:08:34] new birth is to the born-again
[1:08:35] experience it calls us to be a Christian
[1:08:40] don't make an excuse that we can get by
[1:08:42] with things because it were called
[1:08:46] like I said you know our most of our
[1:08:48] repentance is cause we call them
[1:08:50] something right let's see in a Christian
[1:08:57] will not have to be told is wrong to do
[1:09:02] do you mean I've got to tell you it's
[1:09:04] wrong to commit adultery
[1:09:06] now there's something wrong but brother
[1:09:10] Dale after a job not ain't my job the
[1:09:16] Holy Spirit was supposed to took care of
[1:09:17] that one who got it yeah but we didn't
[1:09:21] know I was wrong oh we wouldn't talk so
[1:09:22] you're using excuse you're the same
[1:09:27] thing if you get one combi you're the
[1:09:29] same thing as the little boy go
[1:09:31] apologize I'm sorry is that the way we
[1:09:37] do
[1:09:38] we're found guilty we go before God we
[1:09:40] say I'm sorry just remember he knows
[1:09:49] whether you're or not okay now we're
[1:09:54] gettin to Christ because that
[1:10:00] justification just chops that seeing off
[1:10:04] I'm in future home come on
[1:10:07] it just chops off you Pisceans it does
[1:10:12] nothing to your nature I'm quoting
[1:10:15] brother Branham all it is Lord I'm sorry
[1:10:21] and it is really what we say come on now
[1:10:27] you gonna be honest enough to admit it
[1:10:28] we come before God when said god I'm
[1:10:30] sorry did Lord I'll try my best not to
[1:10:33] do it again that's a better answer than
[1:10:36] to tell him I won't do that no more Lord
[1:10:40] right best answer is just be honest with
[1:10:43] him Lord I'm sorry if you'll help me
[1:10:47] I'll try to get rid of that but I ain't
[1:10:51] gonna tell you ain't gonna do it again
[1:10:55] my brother to hell you're crazy
[1:10:57] you sure are fun
[1:10:59] the way you preach that I agree but a
[1:11:01] God likes it sometime
[1:11:02] cuz I believe it's the truth we'll see
[1:11:08] our apologies before God they're not
[1:11:10] worth anything unless they're meant from
[1:11:13] an inside and that's why the Bible says
[1:11:16] now listen the Bible says the goodness
[1:11:21] of God leadeth thee to repentance and it
[1:11:28] speaks of a repentance that need not to
[1:11:30] be repented of that means it's taken
[1:11:36] away whatever it is so you see when the
[1:11:40] Prophet was covered in look how
[1:11:41] wonderful justification just jumps off
[1:11:45] that Piscean you're the same identical
[1:11:49] person you was you're just a repentant
[1:11:51] sinner right then God begins to deal
[1:11:57] from the inside of you not on the
[1:12:00] outside justification is chopping off
[1:12:03] for the sins of the soul is not chopping
[1:12:05] off the sins of the body in the spirit
[1:12:07] that's what we think it is it's got to
[1:12:10] be done from the inside the goodness of
[1:12:12] God leadeth thee to repentance LeBron
[1:12:15] says a human mortal ever mortal is made
[1:12:18] to serve God am i right ever mortal
[1:12:22] being that's why they serve they worship
[1:12:25] idols and totem poles and time we're
[1:12:27] made to worship God but then
[1:12:32] sanctification see starts cleansing that
[1:12:35] inside that nature you remember how we
[1:12:39] brought it out lye Sunday then what you
[1:12:42] start repenting and that nature if you
[1:12:45] just get in that word and live in that
[1:12:47] word that word will start taking out the
[1:12:49] desires of doing those time.if start
[1:12:52] letting you know that it's wrong to do
[1:12:54] that something's working on the inside
[1:12:57] then you're the seal still the same
[1:13:01] person in body and spirit but it starts
[1:13:05] dealing from the inside of you a moral
[1:13:10] obligation
[1:13:12] is the best definition I've ever been
[1:13:14] able to find in my study of the message
[1:13:17] about a moral obligation God knows we
[1:13:24] will turn our selves or to know that we
[1:13:28] will come into this world lost and
[1:13:29] doomed and on the way to hell will to
[1:13:31] know that without even a preacher to
[1:13:32] preach it - we were to understand that
[1:13:35] because this goodness is what's leading
[1:13:38] us what brought you to where you are
[1:13:41] what turns you around in Christ
[1:13:44] what started your journey in a different
[1:13:46] direction something from with the end
[1:13:49] what it didn't change the other people
[1:13:51] that was around you come on church I've
[1:13:58] tried to explain it without people
[1:13:59] listening to and say well who do you
[1:14:00] think you are I've told you over and
[1:14:03] over that as a sinner when I would do
[1:14:06] wrong they was something that was
[1:14:09] burdening me and I'd ask God to forgive
[1:14:13] me of course I went back and done the
[1:14:16] same thing again because I'm telling you
[1:14:18] then that was the only thing I could
[1:14:20] pray God do something about this man
[1:14:23] that I am cause one part of these
[1:14:26] wanting to do good the other part of me
[1:14:32] just can't find a way to do it now come
[1:14:36] on don't let's don't get in the Baptists
[1:14:37] with it you know the Baptist's believe
[1:14:39] that Paul had that burden in him when he
[1:14:41] said the things I do not I would not do
[1:14:43] it on evil would I do not he said it was
[1:14:44] the you've never been in the Baptist you
[1:14:47] the order to listen brother Brian I'll
[1:14:48] tell you them Baptists you better listen
[1:14:50] they'll tell you some word you know what
[1:14:52] the Badgers bleed about Paul Romans one
[1:14:55] two three four five six
[1:14:59] he was explaining how to get saved seven
[1:15:08] he started the condemnation to bring the
[1:15:11] words Christ and explaining what was
[1:15:12] happening in his life the eighth chapter
[1:15:17] there's no condemnation in Christ Jesus
[1:15:19] and how does it start 8:1
[1:15:26] but I couldn't agree with it then
[1:15:28] because it didn't work I didn't know the
[1:15:31] words though when the Prophet said it a
[1:15:35] holiday men he said Paul was writing to
[1:15:39] the Christians he was explaining what
[1:15:42] was happening in his life after he got
[1:15:45] mourned again I mean if you read Romans
[1:15:52] wonder what he was talking about the
[1:15:54] things I would I do not the things I do
[1:15:55] I would not and then if it's not this me
[1:15:57] said then I followed by the outward man
[1:16:00] I followed the things of the flesh or in
[1:16:02] other words of the body he said but by
[1:16:04] the N word man I served the law of
[1:16:06] Christ he wasn't explaining how to get
[1:16:10] born again he's explaining how we are I
[1:16:12] do we get born again how do we get born
[1:16:15] again it's the inside that's living
[1:16:17] you're not born to get in your body
[1:16:19] you're not born to get in your spirit
[1:16:22] that's why you can be anointed on your
[1:16:25] spirit with a true Holy Spirit they did
[1:16:28] not save you because it's not the new
[1:16:32] birth that birth has to be with inside
[1:16:35] of you and it comes out early that's the
[1:16:39] goodness of God that leaders they were
[1:16:41] dependent he starts working on the
[1:16:43] inside of man to get contact I just
[1:16:46] didn't have nobody could explain it to
[1:16:48] me
[1:16:48] but I do that I did I do wrong and
[1:16:51] things and I thought I shouldn't do this
[1:16:52] you didn't go to church and sit in the
[1:16:55] pews and realize that preacher preaching
[1:16:57] at you right
[1:17:08] this one's yours I'm trying to get you
[1:17:12] to see something that's real to me and
[1:17:15] supposed to be real to each one of us in
[1:17:17] our heart that nuber starts on that
[1:17:20] inward man and works its way out it
[1:17:24] don't start on the outward man it starts
[1:17:28] on the inward man and works its way
[1:17:31] outward Li cleansing it driving out the
[1:17:35] unclean spirit out of this role where
[1:17:37] the Holy Ghost can come and dwell in the
[1:17:39] soul and give you a new birth the end
[1:17:44] that Holy Spirit that gives you that new
[1:17:47] birth begins to work out through your
[1:17:49] spirit now you got something on your
[1:17:52] side you ain't got this - I quit that
[1:17:56] didn't do it no more what I wanted to do
[1:17:58] it and I would have done it but right I
[1:18:00] know if I got caught how many of you
[1:18:03] ever lived in that state well I'm glad I
[1:18:11] didn't do that because I got caught okay
[1:18:14] come on but when you get truly born
[1:18:18] again you find out there's something on
[1:18:20] the inside living he's dealing with your
[1:18:25] nature
[1:18:26] they said Paul said Peter speaking of a
[1:18:30] divine nature and that soul becomes
[1:18:34] eternal the divine nature of God is
[1:18:37] living within it but then he starts
[1:18:39] dealing with in the outward and the
[1:18:41] Prophet said after coming into the body
[1:18:43] the adoption series 55 he said after
[1:18:49] coming into the body your protector of
[1:18:51] the divine nature right now every moment
[1:18:54] of our lives should be a desire in our
[1:18:56] hearts and lives to have the nature of
[1:18:59] God well Brunel I think I'm doing pretty
[1:19:05] good right there you just stumbled all
[1:19:07] over the biggest problem you got you you
[1:19:12] just exposed yourself when you think
[1:19:16] you're doing pretty good well I don't
[1:19:21] lie don't cheat
[1:19:22] don't steal well praise God so does the
[1:19:24] neighbor yeah but he don't believe the
[1:19:27] message like me
[1:19:28] no he believes more of it cuz he ain't
[1:19:32] using this as an excuse right no come on
[1:19:37] listen to be partakers of his divine
[1:19:40] nature wonder where we can become into a
[1:19:44] reflection of Jesus Christ to live in
[1:19:47] Christ so I pull it back up now and
[1:19:53] we'll finish this and we'll quit
[1:19:55] we'll get another few minutes go ahead
[1:19:57] and pull second Peter back up
[1:19:59] all right we're called a glory in virtue
[1:20:00] so you got that your new birth or to
[1:20:04] call every one of us to a Christian life
[1:20:06] because that's what that virtuous life
[1:20:08] means dark
[1:20:09] that means a virtuous clean sweet
[1:20:12] Christian life you want the definition I
[1:20:16] got him laying right over here from the
[1:20:18] Strong's in the time all right now look
[1:20:21] from that point on watch whereby are
[1:20:24] given unto us what he's give it to us
[1:20:28] all the way precious promises he might
[1:20:30] be partakers of the divine nature having
[1:20:33] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:20:35] world through lust and beside this
[1:20:37] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:20:39] virtue and to virtue knowledge that's an
[1:20:43] entirely different word from that word
[1:20:44] I've got them laying here this word is
[1:20:49] the same identical one in the scripture
[1:20:52] but your prophet this one is a virgin
[1:20:57] lies to him this one is strength or
[1:20:59] power so it's got a growth development
[1:21:03] added to it when you're called to glory
[1:21:08] and virtue now listen you realize then
[1:21:11] now listen you're gonna think I've
[1:21:13] throwed a curve so listen every
[1:21:17] Christian is called to glory and virtue
[1:21:19] every Christian is called to live a
[1:21:22] virtuous life ever Christian is supposed
[1:21:25] to be living in Jesus Christ letting
[1:21:27] Christ live from the inside out to bring
[1:21:30] us to a life that is that becomes to
[1:21:33] work that he can guide us and direct us
[1:21:35] throughout our lives and we'll be
[1:21:37] Christians right but you know what if
[1:21:45] you're not in the truth of the hour how
[1:21:49] can you be being called a voter in
[1:21:51] virtue we just moved up a step now so
[1:21:55] listen how can you say your call to
[1:21:58] glory in virtue if you don't even know
[1:21:59] what glory and virtue is you realize the
[1:22:07] faith of the fathers has got to be into
[1:22:09] an individual before these virtues are
[1:22:12] worth anything I'm quoting brother
[1:22:14] Branham he said gifts without these
[1:22:17] virtues as a stumbling block
[1:22:20] Tumbo block is actually the correct word
[1:22:25] but listen Church get it let me see if I
[1:22:30] can find something to I wrote my notes
[1:22:34] we'll hold on a second there was a word
[1:22:39] that I wanted the definition of I'll get
[1:22:42] it later
[1:22:43] it stands in and in that but listen
[1:22:47] come on musicians come on listen Church
[1:22:56] there's got to be a growth development
[1:22:58] in the Christian life to grow up in Him
[1:23:04] who is the head because you know you'd
[1:23:08] have to admit where are we today now
[1:23:11] listen are you following where are we
[1:23:13] today in comparison to the Apostles you
[1:23:18] realize then that we've got to come to
[1:23:19] where they were yeah we can't never kind
[1:23:24] of worked ours where you're lying
[1:23:26] because you're taking your thoughts from
[1:23:28] what's been in your life before the
[1:23:31] Prophet said these things are required
[1:23:34] he said Lord you sent me I'm quoting
[1:23:38] from statute of perfect man he said Lord
[1:23:41] you sent me to bring these things or
[1:23:43] build a church into these things he said
[1:23:46] again the Lord filled me up with these
[1:23:48] virtues that
[1:23:49] I may teach other apostles prophets
[1:23:51] evangelists pastors and teachers for the
[1:23:53] perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:23:56] edifying of the body of Christ you will
[1:23:57] all come to the unity of the faith you
[1:24:04] see then that's the job of the file for
[1:24:06] ministry
[1:24:09] now you're gonna flop this go ahead flop
[1:24:12] because you always have with me brother
[1:24:15] branham was not sent for the perfecting
[1:24:16] of the saints I want the scripture I
[1:24:21] want the scripture and I want the
[1:24:23] Prophet but I'll state it this way the
[1:24:31] fivefold ministry without this prophets
[1:24:33] message is not sin either nope
[1:24:39] but the fivefold ministry that sent them
[1:24:42] God to bring this message to the people
[1:24:44] after the Prophet left the scene is to
[1:24:47] bring us to these things and that's the
[1:24:52] group of people that's called to glory
[1:24:54] and virtue you realize you and I are
[1:24:57] called to a higher height than any of
[1:25:00] them down through any age any age you
[1:25:04] realize the Apostles in the faith of the
[1:25:07] fathers they're still in the ground
[1:25:08] waiting on you and me that's according
[1:25:11] to the Bible according to the Bible they
[1:25:15] without us cannot be made perfect so
[1:25:20] then what is the fivefold ministry to do
[1:25:21] preach what the Prophet probably we
[1:25:24] don't have a message of our own it's not
[1:25:26] made that way that's why it's done that
[1:25:28] away that's why I went to Ephesians
[1:25:31] we'll go back over it again and over and
[1:25:32] over because remember he gave gifts unto
[1:25:36] men
[1:25:37] what's the gifts that he sent unto the
[1:25:39] church
[1:25:45] you know that brother branham was
[1:25:48] predestinated as a prophet to bring the
[1:25:53] Word of God
[1:25:54] not him physically because that goes
[1:25:58] with it but his gift his life his doings
[1:26:02] was predestinated to bring us a message
[1:26:05] the fivefold ministry is predestinated
[1:26:08] to bring the message I didn't say it's
[1:26:10] your prophet said they'd break these
[1:26:13] things down
[1:26:14] I see we don't want a fivefold ministry
[1:26:20] we think we've got it just cause we've
[1:26:23] you're the Prophet but then somebody
[1:26:26] comes along and quote something and you
[1:26:28] don't even know what the Prophet said
[1:26:31] that's what I said people can tell you
[1:26:36] all about brother branham's message they
[1:26:38] can tell you all about the seals and the
[1:26:41] seventy weeks of Daniel and a lot of
[1:26:42] money even Network never read the book
[1:26:45] they can tell you all about it
[1:26:47] and you know what most of you will sit
[1:26:52] and listen to that when the first thing
[1:26:55] you were to ask him have you ever read
[1:26:57] the book well no brother ain't that read
[1:27:01] the book we'll just shut up they don't
[1:27:08] need listening to you shut up you don't
[1:27:10] never read the book you can tell me all
[1:27:12] about it and that what most people have
[1:27:21] done to the Bible they've never read the
[1:27:24] Bible but they can tell you all about it
[1:27:27] right let's Dan well we got really
[1:27:36] we've got to be become the very nature
[1:27:41] of Almighty God
[1:27:44] that's what's keeping us here after 50
[1:27:47] years the prophets left the same it's
[1:27:50] because we're not listening to his word
[1:27:52] we're not following what he says and
[1:27:59] it's showing up you might have a need
[1:28:14] remember what I'm trying to break a
[1:28:17] Christians brow how the glory and virtue
