[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] okay ready yeah let's pray everybody
[0:11] normally probably thank you for that
[0:13] skips guys are they in your name or for
[0:15] services in the Sun that's cool prayers
[0:17] blesses everything that's done
[0:18] materially help us teach in the Senate
[0:22] school no sources upstairs we'll just
[0:27] nothing ministers that's just be nice to
[0:29] hear understanding the words that come
[0:31] forth I pray one straighten out one
[0:40] thing the last time I have taught two
[0:42] lessons last time back-to-back and I had
[0:45] said I was gonna be arrogant and about
[0:47] something I was arrogant I think about a
[0:49] lot of things okay all right it sounded
[0:51] like it anyway but on that second lesson
[0:53] grab the start of it I was specifically
[0:55] a lot of 15 minutes for talking about
[0:58] mine and Gabby's marriage and about
[1:00] dreams that EULA had and so forth and I
[1:03] felt like that was being arrogant but
[1:04] all I simply doing is trying to show
[1:06] y'all how that you put Christ in your
[1:09] marriage and God will bless you for it
[1:10] and that's all that I took those dreams
[1:11] to me not have not many anything I was
[1:14] just assuming that the Lord was telling
[1:16] us I'm pleased with what you're doing
[1:17] okay it's all I was trying to say I
[1:19] wasn't trying to brag but anything we've
[1:20] done I hope taken that way but later
[1:22] this lesson I'll try to get back into
[1:24] that topic about marriage and putting
[1:25] Christ in your marriage and starting to
[1:27] make more sense because I believe in
[1:30] sick and gone in every facet of your
[1:32] life every single thing and you're
[1:34] individually and together in your
[1:36] marriage
[1:36] and on your job and wherever you're able
[1:39] to think about the Lord meditate pray
[1:41] and read your Bible and so forth so I
[1:45] just want to set that straight cuz I
[1:47] didn't feel right about that other thing
[1:51] if I talk about fish sticks anybody ever
[1:54] seen a fish stick and its natural
[1:55] habitat I mean you read it for I'll read
[2:09] it down a little fine frame over the
[2:11] bent stick pipefish occurs in marine
[2:14] waters throughout much of Indo West
[2:16] Pacific in Australia is known from the
[2:19] central coast of Western Australia
[2:22] around the tropical north and south to
[2:25] central New South Wales the bent stick
[2:28] pipefish has a long snout and a head
[2:31] that projects at a slight angle to the
[2:34] body its coloration is variable from
[2:37] yellow to brown red or black
[2:39] also commonly called the stick fish
[2:41] these I'm sorry the thick the fish stick
[2:45] these creatures are captured battered
[2:47] and fried it can be typically found in
[2:48] the frozen section of supermarkets
[3:01] this is going down it's only showing
[3:10] like they're doing yeah what's that
[4:09] Becky Becky caller always run around
[4:13] with Rebecca one Thank You Colin and
[4:20] we're both the same thing or that
[4:22] from Becky burn anyway the little
[4:25] colleagues browser we have got a still
[4:33] too heavy to money I mean you know she
[4:41] was she
[6:00] I'm gonna throw progress autofill what
[6:02] about technology and this was a
[6:04] Christmas gift so sorry I remember we
[6:16] talking a few years ago about sheep
[6:17] right learned another lesson about sheep
[6:20] this time a little bit more in depth
[6:21] okay the reason for that little story
[6:23] was to show you how cool we are
[6:25] okay like sheep and I want to believe
[6:28] that story I know some of y'all caught
[6:29] on to it but I would have believed it is
[6:30] I'm told me that there is such a thing
[6:32] as a fish stick swimming in the ocean
[6:36] but actually there's a processed white
[6:38] fish meat and so for that thing
[6:40] I'm leather you know alright so all we
[6:42] like sheep have gone astray the title is
[6:44] the west part that going astray as they
[6:47] have 53 all we like sheep have gone
[6:49] astray we have turned every one to his
[6:51] own way and the Lord has laid on him the
[6:54] iniquity of us all psalm 119 176 I've
[6:59] gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy
[7:01] servants rod do not forget thy
[7:03] Commandments so the objective is to
[7:10] better understand the Sheep like nature
[7:12] we have as humans and to recognize that
[7:13] we have a tendency to go astray I'm
[7:16] gonna put up some definitions for y'all
[7:17] because I know I'm going to step on some
[7:18] toes and I'm not leaning and calling by
[7:20] stupid but actually there's there's a
[7:22] good definition here a minute about
[7:23] stupid what it really means and in
[7:26] Scripture we're locking on a sheet this
[7:27] is our sheep like that and results in a
[7:30] great need for a Shepherd the goddess
[7:33] okay stupid is having or showing great
[7:38] lack of intelligence which is a kind of
[7:41] derogatory way to use it or common sense
[7:44] and I'm talking about the common sense
[7:46] part all right
[7:46] so use that word in this lesson I'm not
[7:49] calling anybody stupid like in the
[7:51] derogatory sense intelligence is the
[7:54] ability to acquire and apply knowledge
[7:56] and skills we all have that
[7:59] right we know we have that and we're not
[8:01] lacking that so we're not stupid in that
[8:02] sense we have the ability to acquire
[8:04] knowledge and skill that's why we're
[8:05] here we're learning about the Lord and
[8:07] we're growing like humans sheep are
[8:10] actually intelligent however due to
[8:12] their instincts they can easily be led
[8:14] astray right ignorant means liking
[8:19] knowledge or awareness in general
[8:21] uneducated or unsophisticated and poor
[8:24] Christian that's actually a good place
[8:26] to be in directions in a good position
[8:27] if you are an educated unsophisticated
[8:29] but if you're already obtained if you
[8:30] know I mean I have a little bit of
[8:33] college education and I have to actually
[8:34] try to suppress that some time because I
[8:36] get to this know-it-all mentality this
[8:38] intellectual mentality and that's not
[8:40] the way to approach God alright my next
[8:43] lesson is gonna be about humility I'm
[8:45] talking about how we approach God in
[8:47] humility and in the humble way okay so
[8:51] just laying some of these things out
[8:52] there I'm not calling anybody dumb
[8:54] alright just I just really want
[8:57] everybody recognize how bad we need a
[8:59] shepherd a fivefold ministry we need the
[9:00] Holy Ghost to guide us and direct us
[9:02] okay
[9:02] and the better the sooner we can
[9:04] recognize that better all right so there
[9:09] is no such thing as being too dumb to
[9:12] understand the mysteries of God he
[9:15] reveals them to babes to the uneducated
[9:18] the unsophisticated the simple and the
[9:21] humble that will tell you to dumb them
[9:25] tell me that it's not too hard or too
[9:28] complex to understand we simply need to
[9:31] read listen and pray then trust God to
[9:33] bring the understanding the revelation
[9:35] okay
[9:40] and I'll play a little bit of a tape if
[9:43] this technology will work
[9:44] I already forget that speaker over there
[9:47] to work so I had to bring something else
[9:55] there's $1 for long because this is a
[9:57] lengthy quote so that's why my brother
[9:59] Brennan traded to us from the unveiling
[10:03] of God it's all you know the older Hart
[10:06] sisters it was in that day doors they
[10:09] asked to stay away from it now are you
[10:20] behind the word it was C the Word of God
[11:00] is not far off its nightly the Bob says
[11:02] he's in thy heart and my mouth the Word
[11:04] of Faith which we preach right Romans
[11:07] 10:8 he's trying to reveal himself it's
[11:10] us that's lacking because we're not
[11:11] studying in framix he can go to like we
[11:13] showed he's here he's very prevalent and
[11:16] very available to us right and brother
[11:19] said he had blasting himself right out
[11:20] as bright as the Sun not trying to hide
[11:23] himself he hide himself from the wise
[11:24] and prudent but to us he's trying to
[11:26] reveal if we'll make ourselves available
[11:27] who humble ourselves okay that's going
[11:33] amen God University and tight hose is
[11:38] coming from the presence of God with the
[11:41] Word of God for that age watching
[11:45] we're not Exodus 19 miss this mountain
[11:49] Exodus 19 Moses is kind of the presence
[11:53] of God into the word the worst mineral
[12:06] idea the presence of God with the word
[12:10] he had the word for the age there's a
[12:14] word for a change
[12:16] hey all just coming forth his face shine
[12:21] so you get out to the people the true
[12:29] word got it rolled it and was ready to
[12:39] be benefit he was the word today he was
[12:44] a living worth it healed himself
[12:48] Moses had to put a veil over his own
[12:50] face he was that was that just give up
[13:07] something to think about
[13:08] she instinctively follow the lead sheep
[13:11] and their flaw hey I looked all this up
[13:14] on Wikipedia if you want to verify some
[13:15] of this similar to our instinct the
[13:19] Adamic nature okay sometimes that leader
[13:21] can be just the first sheep that moves
[13:24] to another location you know she just
[13:27] followed that instinct it's so ingrained
[13:28] in them that they can actually like the
[13:30] grass they're eating they can
[13:31] getting fat good food and then all of a
[13:33] sudden they have the flock just sort of
[13:34] migrate or whatever you call it over to
[13:36] another part of the field say over there
[13:38] and this there's one shakes like willing
[13:40] like this food all along because it's so
[13:43] instinctive he's not really thinking
[13:44] about it it's just an instinct
[13:47] however she often followed the oldest
[13:50] mother which is called the you dance I
[13:53] pronounced that in the flaw so lucky you
[13:56] if you notice you is like half the
[13:58] letter off from being Eve humans do the
[14:01] same thing we tend to follow our mother
[14:02] Eve you know our that that nature that
[14:05] raising on the Word of God instead of
[14:07] letting God reveal it to you I like the
[14:09] denominational churches following the
[14:11] mother or you know the daughter harlots
[14:12] following the mother floor and so forth
[14:14] we tend to follow the old mother and we
[14:18] do that this just by our nature it's our
[14:19] instinct if you will that's part of us
[14:21] that we have to overcome
[14:23] no brother BAM I'm saying hiding behind
[14:31] something simplicity para flinch was
[14:34] because the man was made up in the
[14:36] beginning not to try to shift for
[14:38] himself a man was made to rely
[14:40] completely upon God that's the reason
[14:42] we're liking under Lambs of sheep a
[14:44] sheep cannot lead himself he has to have
[14:46] a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed
[14:48] to lead us so man has made that way
[14:50] brother that was always talking about
[14:51] how that God made things how he wanted
[14:53] her in the Garden of Eden if you want to
[14:55] know how God wants something you look
[14:56] back to the patterns of the original and
[14:58] you know how I want it and in the end
[14:59] beginning in the garden he made man
[15:02] brother Graham said with that nature he
[15:05] made man with this part of him that he
[15:07] needs a shepherd he needs to be led
[15:09] right but will follow the other leading
[15:11] fall the wrong leading if we're not
[15:13] careful we'll go off on her own way
[15:15] especially if we choose not to follow
[15:16] anybody well we're off on our own way
[15:18] but you do not follow a pastor or
[15:20] whatever kind of try to hurry through
[15:25] some of these because it's a long lesson
[15:26] and sheep we have a natural tendency to
[15:30] go astray from common sense and sound
[15:33] doctrine when one dares talk about
[15:36] these lists of things here just mostly
[15:39] natural examples to show you how stupid
[15:41] we really are and a lot of things a lot
[15:44] I'm not teaching about finances of
[15:45] parenting and driving I'm just going to
[15:47] show you how doubly stupid whatever you
[15:49] want to call us in that in those things
[15:52] of life if we don't seek the coach or a
[15:54] wisdom you know we're not going to
[15:56] counsel or whatever about some of those
[15:57] things from the time that financially
[16:00] just for a moment
[16:01] they remedy you're all familiar with him
[16:03] I think what this man and I agree with
[16:07] him I appreciate him not condemning
[16:09] anything he does because he self not
[16:10] watching out a lot but what he does if
[16:13] you really think about it at its root
[16:15] this man is making money off of telling
[16:18] people to bounce their checkbook you
[16:19] shouldn't have to be talkative that or
[16:21] tell people to live below what they make
[16:23] you should have to be told a thing that
[16:24] he always said I teach you what your
[16:26] grandma taught you but I keep my teeth
[16:28] then all I'm doing is saying this is
[16:30] what's supposed to do you know it not
[16:32] going to do it right so he's doing a
[16:34] shepherd in that regard and these are
[16:36] selling in slogans calling cents is not
[16:38] really that common common sense is so
[16:41] uncommon that it is now deemed a
[16:43] superpower all we like sheep have gone
[16:48] astray even in our finances we just go
[16:50] just do what feels right just do it
[16:52] feels good borrow a car here's and make
[16:54] little but spend a whole lot and wonder
[16:56] why we're having problems parenting
[17:00] modern parents typically do not spank
[17:02] their children because they consider
[17:04] that to be abuse if I'm also most
[17:05] talking about here implement like in the
[17:07] world you go to Walmart and stuff and
[17:08] people are begging their children to try
[17:11] to suffice um you know say we just give
[17:13] them a good
[17:13] banging proverbs 13:24 he that spareth
[17:17] his rod hateth the Sun but he that
[17:19] loveth Sam chasing us in The Times these
[17:23] are the guidelines in the Bible about
[17:24] raising children all verbs 2313 withhold
[17:28] not correction from the child for if
[17:30] thou beatest him with the rod he shall
[17:32] not die
[17:33] I was 26 train up a child we should go
[17:35] and then he's old enough apart from it
[17:37] but all we like sheep have gone astray
[17:38] we just go do what feels right maybe
[17:40] maybe the maybe Junior will behave a
[17:42] little better if I try the a surprise
[17:43] notice come in spanking and then
[17:45] rewarding when he does good you know I'm
[17:47] not an expert parent I'm just trying to
[17:49] you know driving all right eyebrow 4:11
[18:02] and watch a lot of people actually I
[18:03] don't drive as much as I do just watch
[18:05] people because it's not that far to stay
[18:07] in between the lines it's hard to not
[18:09] hit someone because everyone likes to
[18:11] plant their car in front of a tractor
[18:13] trailer often more than you would think
[18:15] or front of whatever vehicle you drive
[18:17] you don't know what happens there's a
[18:19] couple of basic principles in driving
[18:21] that I'm going to discuss with you that
[18:23] are often neglected and we know to do
[18:26] these things everybody knows the
[18:28] three-second rule what everybody knows
[18:29] to keep a good phone just even if you
[18:31] don't count to three I don't I just stay
[18:33] really far away from people they get on
[18:35] the brakes and I can't stop in time I'm
[18:38] too close you know so just follow far
[18:42] away and you'll be all right
[18:43] and the speed limit commonly broken now
[18:47] and those too low let's see those broken
[18:50] very often and I say wrecks were little
[18:52] from and I see maybe a couple of wrecks
[18:53] a week on average I do I saw one wreck
[18:58] like this several years ago after our
[19:01] first turn of driving I was coming up 62
[19:04] four-lane divided highway now Ronald
[19:06] Thompson Bridge Road all right right on
[19:08] Thompson bridge and there was a convoy
[19:10] of cars like this pass to me because I'm
[19:12] a big stinky chicken truck Ron spiel and
[19:14] they're all mine mr. Pat over to get
[19:16] around that's okay the one in front
[19:18] decided to stop really hard because of a
[19:22] little piece of plastic and rope
[19:23] kind of dumb but that's okay it would
[19:26] have been alright if the others were not
[19:28] following some clothes the problem was
[19:30] that that one was being followed very
[19:32] close by three or four the car my window
[19:34] was down as it was hot and I heard these
[19:38] cars as they are I'm not any smarter
[19:49] than them I'm just trying to follow good
[19:51] and sound advice and instruction and on
[19:53] phone calls so they all probably thought
[19:56] well it's this guy's fault really
[19:58] you're not gonna fall closer whatever
[20:00] several things we just lets go astray
[20:02] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[20:04] did what everybody else does doesn't
[20:06] matter to make sense or not don't even
[20:07] have credible thought we just do it
[20:09] because every bus is demand and your
[20:11] finances and your drive and your
[20:12] parenting just you try whatever bail to
[20:13] us know what it is it's there we have
[20:20] this one little speed zone over by our
[20:21] house now that construction is on it's
[20:23] 35 years big 55 every single time got
[20:26] their their car on my bumper tanker
[20:33] trucks gas tankers past me in the dope
[20:35] in the in the center growling I don't do
[20:48] that anymore you know say all of those
[20:51] speed limits like it's a limit you know
[20:52] a lot of people take the speed limits
[20:54] that well that's a good starting point
[20:55] let's go up from there let's build on
[20:57] man yeah I'm with ya suggestion yeah
[21:05] this is yes okay
[21:16] this is not so much about what you do
[21:18] for a career this is about you know
[21:20] putting on in your career choice when
[21:22] you choose what you're going to do and
[21:23] yeah and hang about there I made a big
[21:26] mistake over this career
[21:27] several years ago I had a trial and a
[21:29] test and I fell but we went back you
[21:31] made it right and our career choices we
[21:33] often lose sight of what our real goals
[21:35] should be in life we strive for the best
[21:37] paid jobs and all facility cetera how
[21:39] the job will affect our relationship
[21:41] with Laura we should strongly consider
[21:43] whether career choice will cause us to
[21:45] miss church or take away time from the
[21:47] Lord this is another area where we like
[21:50] sheep go astray all right real quick my
[21:54] little testimony about that so about 10
[21:56] or 11 years ago me about 11 years ago we
[21:59] were engaged and I was interested in a
[22:01] job where I could keep her at home I
[22:03] have a strong conviction about that
[22:04] because what brother Brennan said that I
[22:06] want my wife at home and at the same
[22:08] time I have a scripture that says I need
[22:10] to be in church now these two things we
[22:12] need to be in church so I came worked so
[22:15] much that I have to miss church I'm into
[22:16] work enough to keep her at home at the
[22:18] time I dog was not big enough evidently
[22:20] to fulfill both those needs because I
[22:24] said well my boss that way if you want
[22:26] to drive and he was all for me the dog
[22:28] and ask him he said if you have this
[22:30] crowded up but if you're gonna drive you
[22:32] gotta miss church some I should have
[22:34] said no if you want me in the job you
[22:36] make it to run off to miss church but I
[22:38] let my bar my guard down because I
[22:40] wanted to fulfill this part which was
[22:42] all right keep my wife at home that's
[22:44] that's good and honorable but I thought
[22:46] well God can't do both you're not big
[22:48] enough Lord so I'll just go ahead and
[22:49] forget that scripture for a little while
[22:50] well eight years I did that we missed
[22:53] half the windsor night services for
[22:54] eight years because i was having to work
[22:56] late every wednesday almost or every
[22:57] other wednesday finally had this
[23:00] terrible conviction of my heart and i
[23:01] really hated that my phone worked out my
[23:03] boss for three years now i'm not mr.
[23:05] Salem Wednesday night
[23:06] because I simply went to not shift you
[23:08] know we worked it out and you know the
[23:10] Lord blessed us and helped us in that
[23:12] but saying what I have done to let my
[23:14] guard down for that little while and
[23:15] just simply fail the test you know and
[23:17] kept trying won't work it out you know
[23:19] and he I kept getting the sense that you
[23:22] know you got yourself into this you get
[23:23] yourself back out I just made a mess
[23:25] because I was simply trying to fulfill
[23:27] two things and didn't think God was big
[23:30] enough to to fulfill both those leaders
[23:31] okay all right one of the attributes of
[23:38] Satan's Kingdom is busyness
[23:40] I don't mean the work in general
[23:42] business I mean busyness and many
[23:44] scriptures say this depicted is
[23:46] wandering to and fro restless fearful
[23:48] striving totally worried Christ gives us
[23:51] peace that passes understanding a firm
[23:53] foundation promise of a future and
[23:55] expected in Jeremiah 29:11 rest
[23:58] contentment fulfillment Joe etc few
[24:03] scriptures on that so y'all know the
[24:06] parable of the sower of the seed of the
[24:08] Sun so the seed and nineteen thirteen
[24:11] eighteen here you therefore the parable
[24:12] is so you know all the different things
[24:14] others skip down to this part he also
[24:16] that received seed among the thorns is
[24:19] he that heareth or and the care of this
[24:22] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[24:24] choke the word and he becometh
[24:25] unfruitful okay so the business of the
[24:30] chores and things around the house and
[24:32] doing things in the yard and whatever
[24:34] else you got to do that you think it's
[24:35] so important but I think it's something
[24:37] where this is the biggest conflict in my
[24:40] life really for most of the time is this
[24:41] the biggest damn struggle with its
[24:43] trying to put God first around the house
[24:45] not do all the tour's first because the
[24:48] tour firm necessary sometimes need to be
[24:49] done but I'm a perfectionist and try to
[24:51] do just exactly perfect and if I don't
[24:53] have to always be perfect but the
[24:55] problem comes when I thought read my
[24:57] Bible and pray over me and Gabby don't
[24:58] read and pray together until after all
[25:00] well then I'll run out of time so the
[25:03] thing the thing to do is to cook trucks
[25:05] first always and this is a very
[25:07] difficult thing is easier said than done
[25:09] thus the apex of Satan in the apex of
[25:11] Satan's even we tend to succumb to these
[25:13] same attributes by setting our sights on
[25:16] the wrong goal even in our household
[25:18] duties we can easily become distracted
[25:20] like Martha being careful about anything
[25:23] let's read that Luke 10 but Martha was
[25:31] cumbered about much serving Martha
[25:33] wasn't in a honky-tonk or a marshal or
[25:35] anything and really wrong she was
[25:36] serving right doing a good thing good
[25:39] deed and came to him and said Lord dost
[25:41] thou not care that my sister has left me
[25:43] to serve alone bettered therefore that
[25:45] she help me and jesus answered and said
[25:47] unto her Martha Martha they are careful
[25:49] and troubled about many things he did to
[25:50] say you know you're deep in sin you need
[25:53] to know we're pandering thing he just
[25:54] said you're troubled and careful about
[25:56] many things but one thing is needful and
[25:59] Mary have chosen that good part you
[26:01] remember what she was doing just in the
[26:02] feet of Jesus and she was having
[26:04] communion if she was just hearing the
[26:06] Word of God and she no doubt wanted to
[26:09] go he'll probably yearning to go help
[26:10] Martha and do all these chores you know
[26:12] but yet she was living to put that down
[26:15] for in just a minute and go listen to
[26:17] the Lord put it now for just a minute
[26:18] and go listen to the sermon this is our
[26:20] little tiny speaker there twice turning
[26:22] on in her house and you know you can do
[26:24] that while you're doing chores
[26:26] actually you only live another long go
[26:28] through that sure and Mary have chosen
[26:30] that good part which shall not be taken
[26:32] away from her
[26:38] I look too young remember of course
[26:42] tears was in the temple to spewing the
[26:45] word with the Pharisee and so forth at
[26:46] 12 years old well they call about the
[26:47] age of accountability recognizing who he
[26:49] is and mines here he said I must be
[26:52] about my father's business and that's
[26:53] what we need to say we must see you've
[26:54] found father's business we tend to put
[26:56] like these little chores and the little
[26:58] things we do around the house and work
[26:59] and so forth right on par with operating
[27:02] in prayer and it's not just another
[27:04] thing to do this should be up here and
[27:06] then the other things are down here that
[27:08] are so temporal okay it's not that these
[27:10] are not important for now those things
[27:11] are important but nothing in comparison
[27:13] to reading the word and pray and study
[27:15] meditating Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing
[27:18] we also are compassed about with so
[27:20] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[27:22] aside every weight and sin which doth so
[27:24] easily beset us and let us run with
[27:25] patience the race that is set before
[27:29] Matthew 6
[27:34] lay down for yourself treasures upon
[27:36] earth where moth and rust doth corrupt
[27:39] and where thieves break through and
[27:42] still volectro so treasure in heaven
[27:43] where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
[27:46] and where thieves do not great Civic
[27:48] still where your treasure are there will
[27:50] your heart be also be careful not to get
[27:52] distracted and Satan Satan with all the
[27:54] cares of life get much time to God and
[27:56] then marriage talk a little bit about it
[27:59] long ago brother Brown said a lot of
[28:02] things about marriage and about you know
[28:05] basically they talk about Adam and Eve
[28:07] in the garden with the Lord right having
[28:08] communion and if you look up in the cool
[28:10] of the day that's where I found this in
[28:12] the cool of the day if you look that up
[28:14] you find several books about this now in
[28:16] the beginning when God came down the
[28:17] evening and talked to Adam and Eve and
[28:20] the cool of the day and there's great
[28:22] voice whispered to them and they have
[28:23] fellowship love one another now or how
[28:27] the moving of the Spirit went through
[28:29] the bushes the lines came up the Tigers
[28:31] all of them and they worship the Lord
[28:33] man was conscious at all times that his
[28:35] presence was with them they had oneness
[28:37] you know they had a unity and that's
[28:40] what you can experience if you and your
[28:42] spouse if you're able to die no matter
[28:43] if eyes they would do that but if your
[28:45] spouse will sit down after me and talk
[28:46] about the Lord together fellowship read
[28:48] and pray together listen to sermons
[28:50] together and individually that's not to
[28:52] replace the individual quiet time a
[28:58] traditional wedding ceremony takes place
[29:00] in a church sanctuary before Wow before
[29:06] a preacher and in the presence of both
[29:08] God and man presumably the couple being
[29:10] married adhere to this tradition because
[29:12] it is our for God to bless their
[29:13] marriage you would think that when
[29:15] people above the altar that for a
[29:18] wedding ceremony right now obviously the
[29:20] reason they're doing that having this
[29:22] traditional things because in the
[29:24] presence of God man because they want a
[29:25] blessing on their man so with God to
[29:27] make their marriage fruitful or else I
[29:29] just fall in tradition which ever make
[29:32] the last thing a fruitful a holy
[29:33] matrimony which nominal holy means like
[29:36] sanctified means consecrated to God it
[29:38] means God is in it basically what I'm
[29:40] saying however though maybe Christians
[29:43] happen
[29:43] they felt to seek God collectively in
[29:46] their marriage
[29:46] now I'm not be Christian as anybody not
[29:48] saying they're not Christians you can
[29:50] both be and do your individual quiet
[29:52] time but just forget to come together
[29:53] and do that together with you in the
[29:55] Lord and there's a great blessing in
[29:57] that there really is all right this is
[30:01] yet another way we like sheep go
[30:03] straight after the wedding a true holy
[30:05] matrimony should have not gone into the
[30:06] marriage and into the hunt their daily
[30:08] bar reading and prayer talking about the
[30:10] Lord listens phones etc spend time
[30:12] together with the Lord and then the last
[30:15] thing is this we're going to go into our
[30:17] part two next week because I'm out of
[30:18] time with pretty much the Christian life
[30:20] this is the most important thing when I
[30:21] get to like halfway through this lesson
[30:24] so if we're not careful we can go
[30:27] straight even on our Christian
[30:28] experience saving Peter 3:17 a therefore
[30:31] beloved seeing you know these things
[30:33] before beware lest ye also being led
[30:35] away with the error of the wicked fall
[30:37] from your own steadfastness we're not
[30:41] immune okay
[30:42] we have to keep keep steady going this
[30:44] is a race we're running still second
[30:46] Peter 2 but there were false prophets
[30:48] also among the people even as there
[30:50] shall be false teachers among you who
[30:51] privily shall bring in damnable heresies
[30:53] even denying the Lord that bought down
[30:55] and bring upon themselves Swift
[30:59] destruction and many shall follow their
[31:01] pernicious way a reason affirmed the way
[31:03] of truth shall be evil spoken of you
[31:06] know people really do speak evil the
[31:08] message in general you know the world
[31:09] speaks evil with us but there's even
[31:11] folks within the message that speak evil
[31:13] of this church and our pastor and so
[31:15] forth they don't understand first Peter
[31:18] 2:25 for you are a sheep going astray
[31:20] but are now returned to the Shepherd and
[31:23] Bishop of your soul Holy Spirit now I'm
[31:31] gonna play a little game with y'all I
[31:33] think this is this is a little game
[31:36] called name that preacher I've got a
[31:41] quote here from one of our five
[31:43] ministers
[31:44] in this church I'm going to start trying
[31:46] to do this in some of my listeners I
[31:47] want to read the quote to you it's very
[31:49] profound the reason for doing this is
[31:51] because of one sec scripture probably
[31:54] did not without honor in his own country
[31:56] and among his own kin mark six for you
[31:58] say well brother Del's my you know
[32:00] kinfolk or it's just brother Dale's just
[32:02] growing legs just brother Bob you know
[32:04] what long to God I know we don't really
[32:07] come right up and say it but in our
[32:08] heart we really think it by our actions
[32:10] we prove because we don't go back and
[32:11] hear these sermons my conviction is that
[32:13] we should listen to these men the tapes
[32:15] hear over and over and over until we
[32:18] really understand because you don't get
[32:20] it I don't understand I don't get it
[32:22] just sitting in the service that's right
[32:24] distraction is leaving us and so forth
[32:26] kids and whatnot
[32:27] all right this is a really good quote
[32:29] from our pastor I want y'all to say that
[32:32] God is in our thoughtful ministry that's
[32:34] how I'm doing this okay he is really
[32:35] here what about the constant listening
[32:38] to the word and letting the word clean
[32:41] you out now who do you think said that
[32:44] one of the five ministers here how good
[32:50] guess wait just like it's brother nail
[32:56] that was on 1:7 that a.m. service the
[32:59] sermon was salvation Guaymas would be
[33:01] born again I put a timestamp reading
[33:04] find that an hour twenty five minutes
[33:05] into the service what about the constant
[33:07] listen to the word and let the word
[33:08] clean you out y'all believe that that's
[33:10] a constant thing it's not my life put in
[33:12] my duty I listen to once around the dam
[33:14] okay
[33:14] listeners means you have time for a
[33:16] minute you can make time for brother
[33:19] Dale this was rather dealt in his
[33:21] reference to Jesus convert Jesus
[33:23] conversation with Nicodemus you know he
[33:26] was trying to explain with the new birth
[33:28] is to Nicodemus releve oldest right no
[33:30] that just says what about the constant
[33:32] listing of the word Hebrew six twelve
[33:37] that she'd be not slothful but followers
[33:39] of them through faith and patience
[33:41] inherit the promises this is me and I
[33:44] have witnessed our fivefold ministers
[33:46] inherit the promise of the new birth
[33:48] thus I follow them I see what they're
[33:51] doing brother Dale stands up often not
[33:53] bragging I've never took it as bragging
[33:54] these things up and says I used to
[33:55] listen to two types of a and read six
[33:57] books I take that if my pastor tell me
[33:59] how he got in such a progressed level
[34:01] the revelations so close with the Lord
[34:03] I want to be in there too this was the
[34:06] path I follow right respective persons
[34:09] if brother nailed up there that way I'll
[34:10] get there that way so that you be not
[34:14] slothful questions you need to study
[34:15] them the followers of them who through
[34:17] faith and patience inherit the promises
[34:20] God keeps his word brother Branham say
[34:22] us oh this is one brother never make
[34:26] reference to a couple weeks ago in his
[34:28] sermon but you go into a place where I
[34:29] pass through the solid gospel teacher my
[34:32] gosh all hell will never move that
[34:35] church really strong flow do the
[34:38] processing yesterday today forever it
[34:40] works so much greater in foreign
[34:42] countries that then it doesn't American
[34:44] because we have been so and documented
[34:46] with different teachings so forth so
[34:48] many times we've failed to get the real
[34:49] power of the gospel out of the gospel
[34:52] because we're trying to make it so
[34:55] complicated and to see how simple it is
[34:57] we missed it by that way
[35:00] how many more minutes I got David good
[35:03] ok so we go about real people time I
[35:05] want sure if you're going back I'm
[35:07] really late
[35:07] well that one said it's like three more
[35:10] minutes he only got three minutes okay
[35:12] alright nevermind oh come on give us
[35:14] five minutes yeah he's got having so
[35:17] simplicity we expect it to be some great
[35:20] something we missed the simple thing we
[35:22] stumble over simplicity the Salamis
[35:23] college by strolling over simplicity God
[35:26] is so simple
[35:27] until the scholars of these days and all
[35:30] days miss him a million miles because in
[35:32] their intellects they know that there's
[35:33] nothing like him so great buddy in his
[35:35] revelation he makes it so simple you
[35:49] find yourself not in revelation that's
[35:51] gone not there with you as much as you
[35:53] would like this is not his fault it is
[35:55] not slack concerning his promise
[35:57] he's like a paper three now we'll pick
[35:59] up there the next time
[36:11] [Music]
