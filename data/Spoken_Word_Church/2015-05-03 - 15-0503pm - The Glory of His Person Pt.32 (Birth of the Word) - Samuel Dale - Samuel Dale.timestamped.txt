[10:39] word that you have given unto each one
[10:41] of us we ask you father that just help

[11:18] things Lord and and just touch him we
[11:20] commit it all to you in Jesus name amen
[11:24] amen
[11:31] Revelations
[11:32] 1 that we've been reading
[11:35] about for quite a while
[11:38] now one of these days we'll get around
[11:40] where we can preach on it and I turned
[11:42] to see the voice that spake with me and
[11:45] being turned I saw seven golden
[11:48] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[11:49] seven candlesticks one lik un to the son
[11:51] of man clothed with a garment down to
[11:53] the foot and G about the PS with a
[11:55] golden girdle remember the symbolics and
[11:57] the things showing of who he is his head
[12:00] and his hairs were white like wool as
[12:03] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[12:05] flame of fire and his feet like un
[12:07] Define Bryce as if they burned in a
[12:10] furnace and his voice is the sound of
[12:12] many Waters let's go over to
[12:16] Luke I've chosen Luke to read there's
[12:20] three times this Parable is
[12:24] um written out in the Matthew Mark and
[12:28] Luke I don't it's not in John it's
[12:31] mentioned as to things but not as laid
[12:35] out so let's go to Luke 8 and we'll
[12:38] start reading at verse
[12:40] 4 and when much people were gathered
[12:43] together and and were come to him out of
[12:46] the city he spake by a parable so went
[12:51] to sew his out to sow his seed and as he
[12:54] sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[12:56] was shoten down and the fouls of the a
[12:58] devoured it
[12:59] and some fell upon a rock and as soon as
[13:02] it was spraying up it withered away
[13:04] because it lacked moisture and some fell
[13:07] among thorns and the Thorns sprang up
[13:10] with it and choked it and others fell on
[13:12] good ground and sprang up and bear fruit
[13:15] hundredfold and when he had said these
[13:17] things he cried he that hath an ear let
[13:19] him hear now remember this in this
[13:23] gospel that without a parable spake he
[13:26] not that he might hide it
[13:31] we were always taught you know that God
[13:33] made it
[13:34] simple no he spoke in Parables to hide
[13:38] it that's what the Bible says all right
[13:41] now listen in his verse n his disciples
[13:44] asked him saying what might this Parable
[13:47] be and he said unto you it is given to
[13:49] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[13:51] God but to others in Parables that
[13:54] seeing they might not see and hearing
[13:57] they might not understand
[13:59] now the parable is this the seed is the
[14:02] word of God now I don't want to keep you
[14:05] standing but I want to point your mind
[14:08] the kingdom of God is the baptism of the
[14:11] Holy
[14:12] Ghost all right everybody with me the
[14:15] kingdom of God is the baptism of the
[14:17] Holy Ghost the way into the kingdom is
[14:21] being described amen all right the new
[14:26] birth all right and that's what he was
[14:29] describing now the parable is this the
[14:32] seed is the word of God those by the
[14:35] wayside are they they that hear then
[14:37] cometh the devil and taketh away the
[14:39] word out of their hearts see being sold
[14:43] lest they should believe and be saved
[14:46] and they on the Rock are they which when
[14:48] they hear receive the word with joy and
[14:52] these have no root which for a while
[14:55] believe on in a time of Temptation Fall
[14:58] Away wait and that which fell among
[15:01] Thorns are they which when they have
[15:05] heard go forth and are choked with cares
[15:09] and riches and pleasures of this life
[15:11] and bring no fruit to
[15:13] Perfection but that on the good ground
[15:16] are they which in an honest and a good
[15:18] heart having heard the word keep it and
[15:23] bring forth fruit with patience all
[15:27] right now remember that keep it so go to
[15:29] Mark now as we'll just read that one
[15:32] scripture that we said was there that I
[15:34] wondered if he'd knew it was there verse
[15:37] 13 Mark 4 and13 and he said unto them in
[15:40] the explaining of the parable know ye
[15:43] not this Parable the parable what the
[15:46] parable of the so that's what's right
[15:48] above there all right and look what he
[15:50] says know ye not this
[15:54] Parable and how then will you know
[15:59] all Parables you may be seated the Lord
[16:01] at his
[16:03] Blessing so to me the key is the
[16:07] understanding of the parable of the soar
[16:10] of the
[16:12] seed because that's into the kingdom
[16:15] because if you don't get into the
[16:16] kingdom you you you won't have no
[16:18] understanding it it won't be there but I
[16:21] want you to keep that in mind when you
[16:22] come back to it and hear it and remember
[16:26] now in the parable as it's being
[16:29] said I said now that is the speaking of
[16:33] the kingdom of God the new
[16:36] birth
[16:37] salvation into the kingdom into the new
[16:42] birth all right are you with me now it's
[16:45] not just a simple little parable of uh
[16:50] just you know well he he tried to make a
[16:53] parable where they can understand now it
[16:55] says there that he spake in Parables you
[16:58] you know that it might be hidden
[17:02] right all right now I'm going to say it
[17:05] this
[17:06] way I believe brother Brandon spoke a
[17:08] lot of Parables absolutely right all
[17:12] right and in speaking those Parables I
[17:17] believe that's what hid
[17:20] it you know am the same way the Lord
[17:23] Jesus spake in Parables to hide it not
[17:27] to make it plain cuz some of the things
[17:29] brother brandham says and and you bring
[17:32] out and the new birth is one of them
[17:33] when we get down to it to really see in
[17:36] what he's saying you'll find out it it's
[17:38] really a parable I I believe Daniel 70
[17:41] weeks is a drastic
[17:43] Parable that was spoken but it you know
[17:47] because it says in the 70 weeks book
[17:49] that it's you know the message he
[17:51] brother R said this is a parable all
[17:53] right and he's sping Parables to hide it
[17:57] amen from the eyes of the wise and
[17:59] prudent I believe the entire message was
[18:02] spoken
[18:03] Parables all
[18:06] right but see we think we understand the
[18:09] parable oh well we know the Parables
[18:11] we've read those things and we we've
[18:12] heard this but did you notice in hearing
[18:15] it that when it used is used in Matthew
[18:18] 13 that it says that they took and
[18:21] understood it
[18:25] right right right it says in mark
[18:29] 13 Mark about four there it says that
[18:32] when it in other words when they heard
[18:34] it they receive it right all right it
[18:38] says in Luke that we just read that they
[18:42] take it and keep it
[18:45] right what was it what is the parable of
[18:48] the so he started off telling you the
[18:51] parable of the so the store is the
[18:56] word right read all four in all three of
[18:59] your Parables about the and it's the
[19:02] word the seed right the word right that
[19:08] is planted all right now when we get
[19:11] back to that you follow that real close
[19:14] and it'll help you in what we're doing
[19:17] but now do not spend a lot of time on it
[19:20] every one of the writings
[19:22] uses
[19:24] uh Luke 814 it talks about the believe
[19:29] and is saved and talks about the
[19:31] heart in Matthew 13 it says that he that
[19:36] understandeth it not in his
[19:39] heart all right it says in Mark
[19:42] 4:5 that Satan cometh and immediately
[19:46] and taketh away the word that was sown
[19:49] in the
[19:50] heart all right now as we said this
[19:53] morning then talking of the new birth it
[19:56] the word heart is the center of man
[19:59] which is really what you
[20:01] are all right so then we could easily
[20:04] say you know that see Satan cometh
[20:08] immediately and taketh away the word out
[20:10] of your
[20:12] soul not out of your thumping gizard
[20:15] called a heart that you can take a
[20:16] transplant and Aaron told me somebody
[20:19] lived 300 and something days with a
[20:21] mechanical heart well that's not exactly
[20:25] the uh you know the heart is the center
[20:28] of anything
[20:29] and that's what you are the soul the
[20:32] being the person you are all right but
[20:35] all of the parables are leading to one
[20:38] thing which is the birth of the word or
[20:42] the seed that was
[20:44] sown all right see then it has to be
[20:47] sown that's why I'm not going to argue
[20:49] with people about it but I do tell you
[20:52] what I believe and why I believe it that
[20:55] way so much is laid in the message of I
[20:58] come with this seed in
[21:00] me
[21:02] well where's it at and what is
[21:06] it then others say I come into the world
[21:09] with eternal life I got a quote I've got
[21:11] one
[21:13] too but you don't like
[21:16] mine Judas went hung himself and you go
[21:19] do likewise that's a direct quote how
[21:22] many times you want to hear the prophet
[21:23] say that but you that's not but brother
[21:27] Dale no no just the point see you say
[21:30] I've got a quote we were talking about
[21:32] it last night in the Bible study that it
[21:35] have been brought to my attention that
[21:37] brother randam said right before the
[21:39] Rapture it would return to a Garden of
[21:41] Eden
[21:42] condition you remember
[21:45] that now do you think the world is going
[21:48] to turn into a Garden of Eden if you do
[21:51] I'd like to sell you some stock in
[21:53] alcatra we're going to make it a tourist
[21:56] attraction would you already have it you
[21:59] understand what I mean there'll never be
[22:02] until the millennial Reign an Earthly
[22:05] situation of being like the Garden of
[22:09] Eden so now you go back to the Garden of
[22:11] Eden and what do you find that can be
[22:14] here
[22:18] now all right what we talking about W
[22:21] was bringing up the new birth puts your
[22:23] soul back like the Garden of Eden with
[22:26] eternal life well that's a Garden of
[22:28] Eden
[22:30] existence right while you're in the
[22:32] worst world conditions that could ever
[22:33] be thought of so this because you got a
[22:38] quote don't lay everything on a quote
[22:41] well bless God there's going to be a
[22:43] Gard if it ain't a Garden of Eden
[22:44] condition happens around here for the
[22:45] Rapture I just ain't going to believe it
[22:47] was was the word go out ahead go out
[22:51] ahead you remember one time when brother
[22:53] BR said it like this on a message he
[22:55] said I believe one day the black and
[22:57] white will fight again die like
[23:01] flies the next
[23:04] message he said that was my
[23:08] opinion not thus sayth the
[23:14] Lord see then we can say well I've got
[23:16] this I've got that all right but does it
[23:19] line up with the rest of the message
[23:21] that's
[23:23] right can you bring it all together to
[23:25] where you don't have to leave out
[23:26] something right yep
[23:30] or deny something or say that can't be
[23:32] true I just explained it to you there's
[23:35] a Garden of Eden conditioned by the
[23:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost into your soul
[23:39] in your soul is the Garden of Eden
[23:41] condition not in the rest of the things
[23:42] not in your body and your spirit cuz you
[23:46] got a
[23:49] battle but now what have we been dealing
[23:51] with I I don't want to get to start I
[23:53] want to try to finish this part and you
[23:55] know we're not through with this part of
[23:57] it we're just uh trying to bring it to a
[24:00] conclusion to where you can understand
[24:02] what I've been driving
[24:07] at then you're not born again in your
[24:11] body you're not born again in your
[24:14] spirit you're born again in your
[24:17] soul the new birth doesn't take place in
[24:20] your body doesn't take place in your
[24:22] spirit goes you can your body is useless
[24:26] death doomed and everything else
[24:29] the spirit can be
[24:30] Anointed with and can be the genuine
[24:33] Holy Spirit and you still be lost so we
[24:37] better get to the condition of
[24:39] understanding and I want to bring this
[24:41] out later as we get into it but I want
[24:44] to lay down some little things and read
[24:45] something and then we'll we'll get to
[24:47] that point all
[24:50] right think about these things what is
[24:52] the new
[24:54] birth then
[24:59] brother brandham what is the New
[25:04] Birth the one that we claim to believe
[25:07] the
[25:09] prophet then we should be able
[25:12] to take what he
[25:16] says contrary to all of our former
[25:19] teachings right and uh Believe
[25:24] it or else if you can't believe what he
[25:28] taught on the new birth then you can't
[25:29] believe what he taught somewhere else
[25:31] that was a reason for me emphasizing
[25:34] that do it that Jesus said if you don't
[25:39] understand this parable of the sore of
[25:41] the seed then how then can you
[25:44] understand any of The Parables right now
[25:48] what was his first Doctrine you must be
[25:50] born again that's right all right so
[25:54] then the the parable would be being born
[25:58] in into the kingdom of
[26:01] God the seed is the word of God
[26:06] Amen but yet if you're going to still
[26:08] hold all of those things you know of
[26:10] saying then then you're annihilating the
[26:13] scriptures from helping you in any form
[26:17] as I was saying a second ago when you
[26:19] you say I come into the world with this
[26:21] seed in
[26:22] me well where's it
[26:25] at brother brandom said
[26:29] that the seed was put in you before the
[26:33] foundation of the
[26:35] world now that's a direct quote right
[26:39] amen but where is it at and what is it
[26:43] Jesus said the seed is the word of
[26:48] God well he didn't seem to be putting it
[26:52] to where that you was born with
[26:56] something I believe his emphasis say was
[26:58] that the kingdom is lik UN to a seed
[27:02] that was
[27:03] sown and the word sown into our
[27:07] heart and I asked a simple
[27:11] question to people that were talking
[27:13] about the seeds and the
[27:15] things and I believe what the prophet
[27:18] said about it always have been and
[27:20] always been able to accept it that way
[27:23] but I asked a person I said are you born
[27:26] again by the SE did you come into this
[27:29] world with in
[27:31] you as you think or was it the words you
[27:34] heard after you got here that's
[27:38] right that's all I want to
[27:42] know because see if you say it was a
[27:44] seed you were born with you don't need
[27:47] no
[27:48] preacher you don't need no Prophet you
[27:51] don't need nobody to explain
[27:54] it right all you need is the spirit of
[27:57] God to
[28:01] descend and if everybody in the day of
[28:05] the time of the Holy Ghost coming of
[28:08] 120 from The Upper Room at one time and
[28:11] then 3,000
[28:14] outside they were surely more right
[28:16] around that period of time of days and
[28:18] weeks or months or
[28:20] whatever from the day of Pentecost there
[28:23] were surely a lot of other people saved
[28:25] right you agree right well how come I
[28:28] didn't get it on there
[28:36] Pentecost oh brother Dale you're so deep
[28:39] you're so this you're so is that
[28:42] deep that's simple speaking of asking
[28:45] you a simple
[28:49] question if you know what you're talking
[28:51] about you can answer the
[28:55] question right but I put that out across
[28:58] the land from the internet anyone to
[29:01] show me the truth about that not as
[29:04] sarcastics or aggravating I want to know
[29:06] the truth you know what I've got
[29:09] probably between 80 to 100 people
[29:11] sitting in this church that are
[29:14] depending in one way or the other at
[29:15] least a little bit upon what I'm
[29:18] saying it may be just a little bit but
[29:21] it's all right and I I want to tell you
[29:23] the truth and you know what my soul is
[29:26] involved you know what what I want to
[29:28] know the
[29:31] truth I'm sincere about it but I'm just
[29:36] showing you or trying to to get you to
[29:39] think the way into the
[29:42] kingdom is made plain and simple by the
[29:46] Lord Jesus in The
[29:49] Parables first you hear it comes into
[29:52] your heart you believe it some people
[29:56] believe it more than others because they
[29:58] hold on longer than others some take it
[30:01] and go all the way
[30:03] through and receive the new birth
[30:06] right all
[30:08] right then what is the new
[30:14] birth what is the natural
[30:17] birth wasn't that what we were talking
[30:19] about the other day of of the Nicodemus
[30:22] you
[30:22] know what is the natural
[30:26] birth it takes a planting of the
[30:29] seed it takes the life to the
[30:32] seed it takes the years and you know I
[30:35] mean a months in the times of nine
[30:37] months to bring forth a natural
[30:41] birth of the one little seed
[30:44] germ that you started
[30:47] with well I
[30:49] thought that that was
[30:52] what you know the Lord Jesus was talking
[30:55] to Nicodemus about
[30:58] was explaining the natural birth for you
[31:00] be able to understand the spiritual
[31:02] birth all
[31:05] right you understand the natural
[31:09] birth the birth of the seed that is
[31:13] planted right
[31:16] right that's the baby right that's where
[31:19] the baby come from from the seed that
[31:21] was placed into the wound and
[31:26] germinated right
[31:28] and it come forth a baby now there's
[31:30] your natural
[31:32] birth all right what would be your
[31:34] spiritual
[31:35] birth
[31:37] right there's never nobody in the Bible
[31:40] ever got the new
[31:42] birth without first hearing the
[31:46] word that's now come on show me in the
[31:50] Bible let's quit playing right show me
[31:53] in the Bible somebody that got saved
[31:55] without hearing the word first
[31:59] come on you know it's not even that
[32:01] ain't even
[32:04] sensible well brother D I just got it I
[32:06] just I never heard nobody I just sitting
[32:08] out under a tree and it dropped okay if
[32:11] you got but don't tell me you never
[32:12] heard it from nobody that's
[32:15] right if you read the Bible you heard it
[32:18] from
[32:19] somebody
[32:21] right do you understand then amen so
[32:25] what is the new birth
[32:28] we'll read in a minute what your Prophet
[32:30] says the new birth is all right then
[32:33] we'll continue on into the process but I
[32:36] want you to read this so go ahead with
[32:38] number
[32:39] one and let's see what the prophet has
[32:42] to bring out about this new
[32:45] birth is taken from the message of a
[32:49] paradox which is preached in ' 63
[32:52] paragraph
[32:53] 98 the Virgin birth was a mystery to the
[32:56] people they couldn't understand it just
[33:00] like the new birth is today the new
[33:03] birth is a mystery to the people right
[33:07] they can't understand it they don't know
[33:10] what you
[33:12] mean they have belittle it bring it down
[33:17] saying you know saying they make it
[33:20] little bring it down by saying well just
[33:22] because you believe
[33:25] something there's people that believe
[33:27] that right just because you believe it
[33:30] that you're born again what dides he say
[33:33] the Devils believe the same and tremble
[33:36] right is that scripture right watch it
[33:40] isn't what you
[33:41] believe it's what God has actually
[33:46] done all right the new birth is a
[33:51] birth it was a new it was a paradox when
[33:55] God brought new life to the human race
[33:58] to reject it is eternal separation to
[34:02] receive it is eternal
[34:03] life all right this new birth started by
[34:07] the birth of a baby we call
[34:11] Jesus because that was where it was
[34:13] transmitted down to you and
[34:16] I to bringing us to that position all
[34:19] right going to Christ is a mystery go to
[34:22] number two Christ is the mystery of God
[34:24] reveal paragraph 240
[34:29] the new
[34:31] birth is
[34:33] Christ is a
[34:36] revelation God has revealed to you this
[34:39] great
[34:40] mystery and that's a new
[34:42] birth see now you can blow that into
[34:45] your mind of your thinking he's talking
[34:48] about Christ as a mystery of the
[34:49] three-fold Revelation that's fine
[34:52] because if you don't get fold number one
[34:54] of a three-fold revelation you ain't
[34:56] going to get the other too
[34:59] amen right so then solve the
[35:03] problem but see God has revealed to you
[35:07] this great mystery now he just said up
[35:09] here that the new birth is a
[35:12] mystery what do you mean it's a mystery
[35:15] all you need to do just get B again okay
[35:17] tell me
[35:19] how well you just
[35:22] believe well the devil
[35:25] believe well you
[35:31] shout well a lot of people the prophet
[35:33] said shouted and didn't get it right you
[35:36] speak in
[35:37] tongues a lot of people spoke in tongues
[35:40] and didn't get
[35:44] it right so what is the new
[35:48] birth so we see it's a
[35:50] mystery and like I said about Nicodemus
[35:53] we say about Nicodemus well that poor
[35:55] old ignorant Nicodemus
[35:58] all he had to do was
[36:02] believe and he didn't know what the new
[36:04] birth is it's just
[36:12] believing what is the new
[36:15] birth
[36:19] okay he said here it's
[36:22] a
[36:25] mystery then he says it's a revelation
[36:28] right
[36:31] y so it must be the mystery revealed is
[36:34] the new
[36:36] birth you following me the mystery
[36:40] revealed to you is your new birth amen
[36:45] amen now what else are you going to make
[36:46] it well I shouted no that's the
[36:49] attributes that's the baby after it gets
[36:51] here that's not the birth of the baby
[36:53] remember the birth of the baby is an
[36:55] example a parable are type of the birth
[36:59] of the new birth that's why that it's
[37:01] got to be water blood and spirit that's
[37:02] why it's got to be seed planted word
[37:05] Made Alive and then the birth of the
[37:07] baby right all right so you got to hear
[37:10] the
[37:11] word it's got to be
[37:14] quickened it's got things that it does
[37:16] through that
[37:19] process of justification and
[37:21] sanctification and then the life or
[37:24] eternal
[37:25] life all right
[37:28] so it's a revelation look at the next
[37:31] one this is taken from the patmas vision
[37:34] preached in 1960
[37:40] 12:04 prph 71 now ask God while we're
[37:44] talking on Revelation ask him to give
[37:47] you a revelation of this now watch it
[37:51] for it can only be known by
[37:55] Revelation and you can only be saved by
[38:02] Revelation well I I just I just felt
[38:09] it
[38:12] no if I'm P for today forgive me
[38:16] okay because I'm going to get this off
[38:18] my
[38:20] heart what happened in the upper room
[38:28] you know there was a whole lot of things
[38:29] transpiring in the upper
[38:31] room where it was filled with the spirit
[38:34] of God and the floating around that
[38:38] doing but didn't it come down to one
[38:41] final
[38:44] analysis and it said tongues of fire set
[38:48] on each one of
[38:52] them paraphrasing brother brandham what
[38:54] did he say that was that's the new birth
[38:58] when that Pillar of
[39:02] Fire that lick of fire that was on each
[39:05] one of them came into the soul of each
[39:10] individual it wasn't the shouting it
[39:13] wasn't the doings it wasn't the speaking
[39:15] in tongues that was outside
[39:18] later right right are we right he said
[39:22] and they spake with tongue here you
[39:24] sitting upstair downstairs maybe might
[39:26] have been 30 minutes later or whatever
[39:27] it was they were outside speaking in
[39:34] tongues but you got to put it back to
[39:36] where he said when that lick of fire was
[39:39] sitting on each one of
[39:42] them all
[39:45] right you can only be saved by
[39:48] Revelation you have a knowledge of it
[39:50] intellectually but you can't be saved
[39:53] until it's revealed to you amen now no
[39:56] man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[39:59] the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible
[40:02] says no man can say Jesus is the Christ
[40:05] until he has received the Holy
[40:09] Ghost right amen come
[40:12] on he might say the pastor says so the
[40:16] Bible says so them are truths the church
[40:19] says so that is true but you don't know
[40:22] know yourself until the Holy Ghost has
[40:24] revealed it to you and he's become in
[40:30] you no man can call Jesus the Christ
[40:33] only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge
[40:36] not by
[40:38] intellectual all right first it's a
[40:43] mystery second it's got to be
[40:46] revealed
[40:47] thirdly you can only be saved by
[40:52] Revelation well brother D I just went up
[40:55] to the altar shook the preacher's hand
[40:56] and said want to be
[40:59] saved or I cried I done
[41:06] this are are you trying to tell me I
[41:08] ain't born
[41:11] again why would you say
[41:17] that why would you say right that that
[41:21] you're thinking like
[41:23] that it could be a signing something
[41:26] wrong with you
[41:27] it could be a sign you need to be
[41:30] saved I didn't get no Revelation when I
[41:32] got the new birth well according to the
[41:35] prophet you didn't get it right
[41:38] y bless God you ain't going to tell me
[41:41] that way I'll just get up and late
[41:45] goodbye not
[41:47] joking dead serious more than any time
[41:51] in my life cuz I'm facing something I've
[41:53] got to express to you
[41:58] I'm not
[42:00] joking he said well if you had said so
[42:02] and so think a lot of people would still
[42:04] be here did I run anybody off by the
[42:06] word of God let me ask you a simple
[42:09] question why didn't you go that's
[42:14] right amen yes
[42:18] sir that's all I got to say why didn't
[42:22] you go
[42:29] okay but you see I try to do everything
[42:31] I can and to bring it down the way that
[42:33] I can bring it for you to
[42:38] understand because I'm not trying to be
[42:40] popular I'm not trying this church
[42:42] wouldn't build on
[42:44] popularity it's built on one thing what
[42:47] does the word say all right now look
[42:52] see first it's a
[42:55] mystery then it's a revelation to
[42:58] explain the mystery only to
[43:01] you because you're the one getting the
[43:04] birth all right then you're saved by
[43:07] Revelation from God's
[43:10] word now look what he says go ahead with
[43:13] number four when you must be born again
[43:15] 1961 12:31 in the
[43:18] morning now false teachers will bring
[43:21] false birth
[43:27] now do you understand what he means by
[43:31] that do you realize if you have been
[43:34] taught that you're speaking in tongues
[43:36] as your new birth that's a false teacher
[43:38] that taught you that the word of God
[43:40] didn't teach you that if you're taught
[43:42] that you cried you got the new birth
[43:44] that's a false
[43:46] teacher if it's just believe the
[43:48] prophet's message that's a false teacher
[43:51] that's right
[44:00] but watch what he says true prophets
[44:02] will bring the
[44:05] word all right brother brandom brought
[44:08] the word right but anybody true whether
[44:11] it be male female whoever that tries to
[44:14] bring you to Christ fits in that
[44:16] category right amen if they really got
[44:19] the word or seed all right watch what he
[44:21] said true prophets will bring the word
[44:24] the birth of the word Christ
[44:28] right false prophets will bring false
[44:31] birth birth the birth of churches the
[44:35] birth of Creeds the birth of
[44:36] denominations and here you are
[44:38] Pentecostal Brothers false sin or
[44:42] Sensations and tell a man he's got the
[44:44] Holy Ghost because he speaks with
[44:45] tongues I've seen Devils speak with
[44:47] tongues pencils lay on lay down and
[44:50] write in unknown tongues that don't mean
[44:53] a thing see it's got to be a life
[44:58] y by their fruits you shall know
[45:01] them brother brandom do you believe in
[45:04] speaking in tongues yes sir you believe
[45:07] in shouting shouting yes sir to be a
[45:10] Christian I believe that I believe God's
[45:14] word but if the life isn't there to back
[45:17] it
[45:18] up now where's it
[45:21] at number five spoken word Original Seed
[45:25] 1962
[45:27] 3:18 paragraph
[45:30] 151 now for the birth of the word is
[45:35] Christ not have polluted with
[45:38] denominations the early church no
[45:40] denomination just a word and spirit
[45:44] irrigated brother and the god laid the
[45:47] word down like that and the Holy Spirit
[45:51] irrigated it and there she went she
[45:54] brought forth children certainly
[45:58] so now what is it right the birth of the
[46:01] word y all
[46:05] right back to Christ the Myster of God
[46:07] revealed picking up on
[46:09] paragraph 233 and read just quite a bit
[46:14] all right so go ahead that would be
[46:16] number
[46:17] six look Christ in you makes you makes
[46:21] him the center of the life of the
[46:22] Revelation see Christ life in you makes
[46:24] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[46:26] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[46:27] complete revelation of Christ Christ in
[46:30] you makes you the complete revelation of
[46:32] the whole thing see what God is trying
[46:35] to do what is the new birth then you'd
[46:38] say well brother brandom what is the new
[46:43] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[46:46] Christ personally to
[46:51] you
[46:53] right then you shout then you cry then
[46:57] you speak in
[46:59] tongues but Revelation
[47:02] first right amen not you joined the
[47:05] church you shook a hand you done
[47:07] something different you set a Creed you
[47:09] promised to live by or C of Ru but
[47:11] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[47:14] revealed to you and no matter what
[47:17] anybody says what takes place it's
[47:22] Christ Pastor priest or whatever it
[47:24] might be is Christ in you that is the
[47:27] Revelation that the church was built
[47:29] upon roll it on up you got some little
[47:32] things in between you read it what is it
[47:35] is Christ being revealed and he is the
[47:38] word and when the word is revealed it
[47:40] expresses itself see that's God's
[47:43] purpose for Jesus Christ was to express
[47:45] himself to take his own laws and live by
[47:50] his laws and fulfill his word by
[47:53] death and Christ God do in flesh in
[47:56] order to them sin in the flesh that he
[47:58] might bring to himself a glorious bride
[48:00] redeem
[48:02] back that will be leave only in the word
[48:05] of God and not swap it like Eve did for
[48:08] intellectual conceptions of man you see
[48:10] it that's Christ's idea that's God's
[48:13] idea the new birth reveals
[48:16] this
[48:19] okay
[48:21] now may I put a point
[48:24] in he just said that God had to die in
[48:28] flesh right to bring us this new birth
[48:33] amen do you believe
[48:35] that God had to die in flesh to bring us
[48:37] his new
[48:38] birth well then how come there so much
[48:41] in the message that everybody says you
[48:43] always was eternal that you already had
[48:45] it when you got here what do you need
[48:47] Jesus
[48:52] for what do you need a new bird for
[48:55] right you mean e in flesh to make it
[48:58] known to you that you always was I know
[49:01] what brother BR was talking about come
[49:03] on we've been over and over you read
[49:07] it when he says you always was eternal
[49:10] look back in what he said he said if you
[49:13] have eternal life
[49:17] today the eternal life was always
[49:21] Eternal there's not but one
[49:25] seed that's
[49:27] right and that's the word of God Amen
[49:31] look and if a man says he's born again
[49:34] and try to place these promises of God
[49:36] in this last day days to some other day
[49:39] making him Christ yesterday but not
[49:41] today then that man or that person has
[49:43] been in a delusion by Satan if that man
[49:46] says that he believes that and it
[49:48] doesn't manifest itself through
[49:52] him
[49:54] okay that's far enough
[49:58] all
[50:01] right what is the new
[50:04] birth it's the birth of the
[50:07] seed as the natural birth was a birth of
[50:09] the seed that was planted into the wound
[50:12] of the mother and must be given life and
[50:15] then the child comes forth the spiritual
[50:17] birth is the birth is the word that is
[50:22] sown and that's The
[50:24] Parables the word is sown
[50:27] the Holy Ghost comes to irrigate the
[50:32] word and the child comes
[50:36] forth the natural is the top of the
[50:39] spiritual
[50:43] right okay so what is the New
[50:46] Birth the birth of the
[50:52] word the birth of the word right
[50:59] so then that means the word has to be
[51:04] planted that's right I mean I just got
[51:07] to planting a garden we did the other
[51:10] day you
[51:12] know Nanny and Terence and I doing Zach
[51:15] heing on some of the others we planted a
[51:17] garden well you know wouldn't it be
[51:19] something to walk out there and look and
[51:22] and we know exactly what we planted in
[51:24] what rows we planted it
[51:27] but even if you some beh have something
[51:29] happened that we have three rows of
[51:35] okra and that three rows of ochre comes
[51:37] up to be turnip
[51:43] greens wait just a minute that wouldn't
[51:47] want our
[51:49] sold right remember you get what you
[51:54] plant and remember the birth is a birth
[51:57] of what you plant
[52:00] right any seed your Prophet says has to
[52:05] what
[52:08] rot planted beans about probably four
[52:12] weeks ago I guess got maybe a half a
[52:14] dozen stocks well you know what
[52:17] something
[52:18] happened they didn't rot and come forth
[52:22] and produce more beans I left them
[52:24] because I hope they will
[52:27] but I went right by the side of them and
[52:29] planted more beans cuz I wouldn't go
[52:32] take no change cuz I just you say well
[52:35] you you will you a farmer yeah yeah and
[52:38] I realized that before that seed can do
[52:40] anything the outside has to
[52:44] rot before you can be born again you got
[52:47] to rotten
[52:49] away die to
[52:52] yourself before the life can come
[52:57] so if I come into the world with eternal
[52:59] life why do I need God
[53:02] for they don't read where brother
[53:04] brandham said it's a seat of
[53:08] representation from
[53:12] predestination and another one says a
[53:14] representation by
[53:19] predestination well you just took away
[53:22] everything that that that I I I believe
[53:25] that I list when I first heard it
[53:27] brother so and so explained that and I
[53:29] just seen that I always was
[53:38] eternal how'd you get
[53:42] it now where does God have anything to
[53:44] do with
[53:45] it will he give it to me well when did
[53:48] he give it to me well it was put in me
[53:50] when I come into the
[53:52] world the quotes are there
[53:57] it's all right you got quote but what
[53:59] about going back a little bit further
[54:00] where he said the seed was put in for
[54:01] the foundation of the world how about
[54:03] that
[54:07] quote and remember it's the birth of the
[54:12] word so the word has to be planted
[54:15] that's right how can we hear without a
[54:18] what and how can he do what unless he's
[54:24] what right amen I ain't no preacher have
[54:28] anything to do with my
[54:30] salvation did you read the
[54:34] Bible well yeah well that was some
[54:37] preachers a whole Bible full of
[54:40] them somebody had to bring the word to
[54:43] you why did brother brandham say if he's
[54:46] not tying together a lot of things he
[54:49] said the seed comes through the body
[54:51] right right he said that's why that who
[54:54] was it Philip had to go down
[54:57] to the Ethiopian
[54:59] unic and remember there was some people
[55:02] in the Bible that were some of the
[55:05] Apostles that were trying to get the
[55:07] Holy Ghost to fall on some people and it
[55:11] wouldn't do
[55:12] it you remember
[55:15] that that's in the book of
[55:18] Acts and they sent for Peter and John or
[55:21] something what was it and they came down
[55:23] and they just said a few words and the
[55:24] Holy Ghost fell amen
[55:31] but brother Dale I just don't feel good
[55:33] when you
[55:36] preach brother so and so preaching I
[55:38] just feel so good I want to get up run
[55:41] with
[55:44] him I'm not making no
[55:47] liot I'm telling the truth
[55:52] true I thought that we believe that if a
[55:56] dumb
[55:58] donkey was able to correct a
[56:04] prophet that we were supposed to believe
[56:07] the word it didn't matter who it come
[56:13] from but I just don't feel it what do
[56:16] you
[56:18] need you need chill bumps we'll run
[56:22] downstairs and get some ice water pour
[56:23] it on you
[56:27] not a
[56:29] joke I'm dead
[56:33] serious wouldn't you do it if you
[56:36] believe that would be what would bring
[56:37] the Holy Ghost on it
[56:40] right would you not go get the ice and
[56:43] pour water down somebody's back come on
[56:45] sisters brothers whoever wouldn't you do
[56:47] that if you believed that that would
[56:49] bring the Holy Ghost
[56:52] righten but you know what they done in
[56:54] the days of the Methodist may I quote
[56:57] your
[56:58] Prophet they poured water on them that
[57:02] were in the floor shouting to keep the
[57:05] holy ghost from coming on them that's
[57:09] right do you need that
[57:13] quote the Holy Ghost was there and then
[57:17] pouring water on them drove it
[57:24] away I'm sorry
[57:28] but I thought we wanted the
[57:31] truth
[57:36] am what is the New Birth the birth of
[57:39] the
[57:41] word to the disciples it says they took
[57:44] it they understood it said they received
[57:47] it they said they kept it or keep it
[57:50] there a correct word
[57:53] there what was the difference in the
[57:55] disciple
[57:58] what was the difference in those that
[58:00] were
[58:02] uh the Bible said that Jesus was seen of
[58:06] over 500
[58:09] Brethren well what happened to 380 of
[58:15] them because there were only 120 in the
[58:18] upper room well they just didn't get the
[58:20] message they didn't get the
[58:23] memo yeah
[58:32] what about it folks what is the new
[58:34] birth why is it so important for you to
[58:37] hear this
[58:40] message would you like for me to turn
[58:42] over and read the LI one I have on you
[58:44] where brother brandham says your
[58:46] Pentecostals turn down the birth of the
[58:51] word and you know what he related that
[58:54] to
[58:56] he said as
[58:59] Mary denied the Virgin birth of the Lord
[59:04] Jesus when she said your father and I
[59:09] have sought you
[59:11] diligently brother BR said she turned
[59:13] down the birth of the word and you know
[59:17] who Mary
[59:23] represents ausa Street Pent C
[59:27] right is that Masterpiece or seed not
[59:30] hour with the sh cuz that quote is from
[59:32] the seed not hour with the
[59:33] sh that they turn down the birth of the
[59:40] word I never been there and do those
[59:43] things I've seen it but I've seen it in
[59:45] Jamaica when uh people were taking the
[59:48] little kids and grabbing their chin and
[59:51] pulling it up and saying say it say it
[59:53] say it say it say it say it say it
[1:00:04] sorry
[1:00:06] folks but just for a moment now I want
[1:00:08] to ask you a serious question I want you
[1:00:09] to listen with me and if I say ha High I
[1:00:13] see you getting sleeping everybody stand
[1:00:14] up okay because I I want
[1:00:17] this on
[1:00:19] tape in the way that I've tried for 40
[1:00:22] something years to explain it
[1:00:26] and to put it into simple
[1:00:29] terminology cuz I've waited for
[1:00:32] that all
[1:00:35] right what is a
[1:00:40] soul it's you the prophet
[1:00:43] said you're a
[1:00:46] soul you're a being your
[1:00:50] person when that baby comes from the
[1:00:53] mother and dropped a little boy girl
[1:00:56] drops
[1:00:57] forth they start immediately forming
[1:01:00] their
[1:01:03] nature of what they
[1:01:06] are their little
[1:01:09] soul doesn't know a whole
[1:01:13] lot you don't recogniz there certain
[1:01:15] things around them but there's a soul
[1:01:17] within that
[1:01:19] baby or else is
[1:01:22] dead all right
[1:01:26] even Jesus when he was a little fell in
[1:01:29] the Cradle could not die for your
[1:01:34] sins even at 12 or 13 years of age that
[1:01:37] he could confound the wives he could
[1:01:38] still not die
[1:01:42] because the soul of that
[1:01:45] person had not fully
[1:01:49] developed into what it would be when he
[1:01:53] would reach the age of accountability
[1:01:55] know coming up then he would come on and
[1:01:56] then he would gain ground and he would
[1:01:58] keep going and he would be 30 years of
[1:02:01] age correctly to say 29 and a
[1:02:05] half because the Bible doesn't say 30 it
[1:02:08] says becoming 30 that's the only way you
[1:02:12] can explain that Jesus was born in April
[1:02:15] and crucified in
[1:02:17] April now do you believe that that's
[1:02:19] what your Prophet said he was born in
[1:02:21] April crucified in April now how could
[1:02:24] he preach three and A2 years
[1:02:29] so he was becoming 30 the Bible says for
[1:02:31] the priest to enter the Ministry Jesus
[1:02:34] at 29 and a half began his
[1:02:37] ministry and as he did his first message
[1:02:40] was you must be born again
[1:02:47] am it took all those years to bring that
[1:02:50] person to that
[1:02:51] place that that soul that being that he
[1:02:55] was was then
[1:02:58] ready
[1:03:00] to do whatever was necessary and bring a
[1:03:04] message when a baby is born naturally it
[1:03:07] starts programming being programmed it
[1:03:09] looks up it sees lights it looks around
[1:03:11] it hears the nurse is cussing and saying
[1:03:13] Full Moon and blanky blank all these
[1:03:15] babies being born the poor little thing
[1:03:17] enters the world in a bad
[1:03:22] shape it goes like we were saying this
[1:03:24] morning when it comes to the age of
[1:03:26] accountability God doesn't record a lot
[1:03:28] about
[1:03:30] it you
[1:03:31] know but when it reaches that age of
[1:03:34] accountability then God puts on a record
[1:03:36] the prophet said and it begins to record
[1:03:38] our lives that's right all right so
[1:03:41] you're not repenting for just being a
[1:03:42] baby when you repent you that's that's
[1:03:47] not the
[1:03:48] point all babies go to heaven right
[1:03:51] right do we need that quote because of
[1:03:54] the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't
[1:03:56] matter what Mom and Daddy is or who is
[1:04:00] what all babies under the age of
[1:04:03] accountability go to heaven wonderful
[1:04:07] God we serve all
[1:04:09] right
[1:04:11] now so the molding of that baby's nature
[1:04:15] we'll call
[1:04:18] it we'll call it that for the purpose of
[1:04:22] following the lineup throughout the
[1:04:24] message of
[1:04:29] understanding and the spirit is the
[1:04:31] nature of the Soul or displays what the
[1:04:34] soul
[1:04:36] is the soul has a nature it's either of
[1:04:39] God or it's of the world so
[1:04:42] automatically when it's first born it's
[1:04:44] of the world all right that's why it
[1:04:46] needs to be born again all
[1:04:49] right that nature for years it took that
[1:04:53] to build that
[1:04:55] and the environment you are
[1:04:58] around is what causes you to be the way
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:03] are I've even preached to you that I
[1:05:06] don't believe in homosexualities are are
[1:05:10] lesbian form of being some genetic form
[1:05:15] of some germ you happen to be born with
[1:05:18] that others were not I believe it's
[1:05:23] hereditary well Mom and Daddy wouldn't
[1:05:25] in that and no but there was little
[1:05:27] things you see certain people you know
[1:05:30] and you'll say well you know they kind
[1:05:32] of act a little odd because they were
[1:05:35] raised by mama and
[1:05:38] Grandmama
[1:05:40] right hi
[1:05:44] higher raised by Grandma and Grandpa was
[1:05:49] not involved so they act a little bit
[1:05:53] on I'm glad you said that they don't
[1:05:55] like like for me to use that word
[1:05:59] feminist right that's right that's why
[1:06:02] the boy needs the
[1:06:05] masculine leadership see because it
[1:06:07] forms a little different in
[1:06:09] him by his
[1:06:12] father building a
[1:06:15] nature bringing a person to a place that
[1:06:18] they become a real
[1:06:24] person and see then one
[1:06:27] day that
[1:06:30] person that has been molded which is the
[1:06:33] soul inside of you and that's why I
[1:06:35] believe like I do what the prophet says
[1:06:37] page 80 of the Hebrew Book that your
[1:06:40] soul is your
[1:06:42] theop now I know you're looking at that
[1:06:44] and I still ain't got to her to preach
[1:06:46] on it but you're thinking my theop is
[1:06:48] way up your I hear my theophany calling
[1:06:52] me that's a pretty song but it
[1:07:01] scripture but it's a pretty
[1:07:04] song see everybody thinks that theop is
[1:07:06] way up
[1:07:09] yonder brother R says your soul is your
[1:07:12] theophany that's right and he says the
[1:07:15] nature of your soul is going
[1:07:20] downward if you're not born again said
[1:07:23] when it you turn it turns upward
[1:07:26] so then a sinner has a
[1:07:28] theophany which is a
[1:07:34] body right The Sinner right today if he
[1:07:37] dies where does he
[1:07:40] go it's easy for us to think where the
[1:07:42] Christian goes right come on
[1:07:47] you what did it even the angel of the
[1:07:50] Lord referred to when brother Brandon
[1:07:52] was beyond the curtain of time the angel
[1:07:54] of the Lord referred to souls under the
[1:08:01] altar but I've always been taught that
[1:08:03] I've got this and my theop is way out
[1:08:07] under where did they get it from brother
[1:08:10] Brandon
[1:08:14] right show it in the message
[1:08:17] right show it in the Bible no it's what
[1:08:21] you've been listening
[1:08:23] to you've been listening to somebody
[1:08:25] explain something that they had no
[1:08:34] Revelation see because your soul is the
[1:08:37] real
[1:08:38] you the real you is your
[1:08:42] theophany remember there is a theophany
[1:08:45] of The Sinner a body that they step over
[1:08:50] into out of the human flesh or they
[1:08:53] don't step over into it that's really
[1:08:56] incorrect it's not that they step over
[1:08:58] into it it's just that Soul leaves that
[1:09:02] body what about an amazing thing that
[1:09:05] your Prophet could go
[1:09:07] there and be young like they were and
[1:09:11] look back and see his body wiggling on
[1:09:14] the
[1:09:16] bed
[1:09:21] right see then the important thing is
[1:09:23] the revelation
[1:09:26] right you say yeah but the Bible says if
[1:09:30] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:09:33] have one waiting look at all the
[1:09:35] questions if it be dissolved right
[1:09:39] brother random who is this MCH we don't
[1:09:43] have the bodies yet that's
[1:09:46] right but you don't want that
[1:09:53] quote but you see
[1:09:57] that little baby that Soul begins to be
[1:10:01] molded into the person that it
[1:10:04] is and even if they're identical
[1:10:08] twins they's still two different Natures
[1:10:11] there even the the magazine thing for
[1:10:14] sister Trudy that showed that where that
[1:10:17] there was two parts of two body parts up
[1:10:20] here two heads two
[1:10:23] THS and grow it into one one body down
[1:10:26] here with
[1:10:27] flesh and one of them girls like there
[1:10:30] was two girls and one of them like boys
[1:10:32] and the other one
[1:10:33] didn't two different
[1:10:36] Natures even though they were so
[1:10:40] conjoined is that they were hooked
[1:10:42] together with only like the bottom parts
[1:10:45] that's being
[1:10:49] one see takes quite a while to build
[1:10:52] that nature into what we are
[1:10:56] amen and it takes quite a while for God
[1:11:00] to get that nature to agree with him
[1:11:02] that we read this morning on who is it
[1:11:05] on
[1:11:08] um what is it I'll get it in a minute
[1:11:11] souls in prison brother R said if he can
[1:11:14] get that nature to agree with him he
[1:11:16] said it'll
[1:11:22] die now where's the wrong and what a
[1:11:29] problem see then if you can see that
[1:11:31] your soul is the real you that's what
[1:11:33] you
[1:11:35] are and it took a long time to bring you
[1:11:37] to where you
[1:11:39] are and what you've been taught all of
[1:11:42] your life is what motivates you or has
[1:11:44] brought you to the place that you
[1:11:46] believe what you believe right all right
[1:11:50] some way
[1:11:52] somehow God enters into that
[1:11:56] person not in body cuz that won't save
[1:12:01] you not in spirit cuz that doesn't save
[1:12:05] you God in some miraculous
[1:12:10] way can enter and speak to that inner
[1:12:15] being the real
[1:12:18] person that you
[1:12:21] are and if you'll just do like the
[1:12:23] disciples
[1:12:26] cuz remember it says many took it and
[1:12:30] believed it but the cares of life and
[1:12:33] the things went on and they lost it but
[1:12:37] some believed it you had never read
[1:12:39] where the Dr disciples would
[1:12:42] say now we
[1:12:45] believe you that you are this that and
[1:12:48] Jesus even would say do you now believe
[1:12:51] right
[1:12:54] y you know as it come to the place that
[1:12:57] you believe they were living the parable
[1:13:00] that he was talking
[1:13:03] about the word was being swn into their
[1:13:08] heart their being their
[1:13:11] soul the word was being planted into
[1:13:15] them but to some it just got to the
[1:13:19] brain out they went some it got a little
[1:13:22] further and got into the spiritual Realm
[1:13:25] you know the spirit part and to begin to
[1:13:28] act like they were
[1:13:30] Christians Judas is a good example
[1:13:33] right because you want to use him as a
[1:13:35] dirty gu all the time
[1:13:37] anyway and
[1:13:40] uh well it took
[1:13:42] three and a half
[1:13:49] years are you
[1:13:51] listening it took three and 1/2 years to
[1:13:54] drive that unclean Spirit out of them
[1:13:59] disciples it took three and A2 years to
[1:14:03] plant the
[1:14:04] word that they would finally say where
[1:14:08] can we go thou Hast the words of eternal
[1:14:12] life yet turn right back around and say
[1:14:15] we don't understand what's going on are
[1:14:16] you going to restore the kingdom now
[1:14:19] because they didn't understand that in
[1:14:20] the book of Acts they got over acts one
[1:14:22] and along in there right they were still
[1:14:25] looking for a literal Kingdom after all
[1:14:27] they'd heard and
[1:14:28] seen but you know
[1:14:31] what they only had one thing to their
[1:14:34] advantage they stayed with the Lord
[1:14:38] Jesus to hear the
[1:14:42] word you ever notice brother brandom in
[1:14:45] what he
[1:14:48] says he said Paul never left his
[1:14:53] converts he he stayed with them until
[1:14:56] they got
[1:14:57] anchored what's he talking
[1:15:00] about he said that was Billy Graham's
[1:15:02] problem he said because they didn't have
[1:15:04] anything you know they didn't stay with
[1:15:05] them and keep them going he said Paul
[1:15:07] went and live with the man
[1:15:10] right now like we was explaining to
[1:15:13] somebody there
[1:15:14] yesterday suppose the man that Paul was
[1:15:17] talking to received this new
[1:15:20] birth we see Paul then could stay with
[1:15:23] that man and and teach him the stature
[1:15:26] of a perfect man up to right
[1:15:32] here you know what he come out to be
[1:15:34] faith of the
[1:15:35] fathers but what about somebody that
[1:15:38] never got the new birth exactly when he
[1:15:41] first expressed
[1:15:44] it what about some of them like at the
[1:15:47] house of of apoll what in know Words the
[1:15:50] book of Acts when they were having a
[1:15:53] great Revival talking about Jesus
[1:15:58] Christ but they didn't know he had come
[1:16:00] and died they knew about him and they
[1:16:03] were talking about it and Paul explained
[1:16:06] to him that he was dead now and he'd
[1:16:10] come to do what he said he's going to
[1:16:15] do and you know what they got the new
[1:16:21] birth but does that help you understand
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:25] three and a half years the disciples
[1:16:27] live with this man I come on don't be
[1:16:31] silly with me you said well the
[1:16:33] disciples only with him about 3 years
[1:16:35] two months and three days boy you're
[1:16:36] really
[1:16:38] smart You're just showing how dumb and
[1:16:40] idiot you
[1:16:42] are don't be playing
[1:16:46] words you can get yourself in trouble
[1:16:48] with God playing with
[1:16:51] words trying to show how smart you are
[1:16:57] forgive me but that's
[1:17:00] truth you think you straighten something
[1:17:02] out because it was not that wasn't my
[1:17:05] wife is real bad I'll say we went to
[1:17:07] town on Thursday it was
[1:17:10] Friday I said we got there Thursday at
[1:17:13] 2:00 it wasn't it was Friday at 3: she's
[1:17:16] really got to keep me right on what
[1:17:18] we're
[1:17:20] doing cuz she thinks I'm losing it
[1:17:22] upstairs
[1:17:25] and you know what I never did have
[1:17:26] anything to
[1:17:28] lose I probably lost that a long time
[1:17:31] ago but is it true I'm not throwing off
[1:17:34] on her I'm telling you just like we all
[1:17:37] are we love to correct each
[1:17:40] other okay get you to life before you
[1:17:43] get away from that sad part
[1:17:48] listen what happens in the New Birth
[1:17:50] then
[1:17:55] see the disciples we'll use those as
[1:17:58] examples to leave it but speaking of
[1:18:01] us the disciples had the opportunity for
[1:18:04] three and A2 years to not just hear what
[1:18:07] the man said but question him about what
[1:18:09] he was talking about and he would
[1:18:12] explain it to them privately of what he
[1:18:15] was
[1:18:16] saying and what was going on you know
[1:18:19] that this is the way into the kingdom I
[1:18:22] spoke in Parables to hide it from the
[1:18:23] others but now you can understand what
[1:18:26] I'm talking about I've come to die I
[1:18:29] must give my life I must set a stage and
[1:18:32] fix it to where you can have what I have
[1:18:35] but the only way it can be done is
[1:18:37] you're going to have to have it done in
[1:18:40] that
[1:18:41] soul that being that person that you
[1:18:45] are all
[1:18:47] right as I said and we say it again
[1:18:51] however old you are as how long you've
[1:18:53] been working on your nature
[1:18:55] in your
[1:18:57] ways that's your soul that I'm talking
[1:19:01] about no that's my body Spirit no no no
[1:19:04] no no no body without the spirit is dead
[1:19:08] Spirit can be Anointed with a Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] and still
[1:19:12] wrong we're not dealing with that you're
[1:19:14] not birthed there you're birthed in that
[1:19:17] stroll cuz that's the only place the
[1:19:19] word
[1:19:21] stays you take that word and you hold it
[1:19:24] you you say I don't understand it that's
[1:19:27] right I didn't understand this message
[1:19:30] when I walked out of the Baptist Church
[1:19:31] did you understand it when you left
[1:19:33] where you were
[1:19:36] at no it took years to
[1:19:44] understand they didn't run me out of the
[1:19:46] Baptist Church I left in my own accord
[1:19:48] because I knew I was contrary to their
[1:19:50] Doctrine and thereby I couldn't stay in
[1:19:53] that church
[1:19:55] that's what they asked me when I come
[1:19:56] out my mother asked my brother where you
[1:19:58] going I said I don't really know I said'
[1:20:00] I know what I'm doing now I'm going up
[1:20:01] to a church at Gainsville because i'
[1:20:03] been up there a couple of times but I
[1:20:04] said I don't really know my brother said
[1:20:06] are you a preacher I said don't know
[1:20:07] nothing about it don't make no claims to
[1:20:09] me he said well if you want a church
[1:20:11] we'll just build you a
[1:20:13] church well I had enough power in that
[1:20:15] church to probably sway the whole church
[1:20:17] and took it over cuz what I didn't have
[1:20:19] on my side my brother-in-law had it on
[1:20:20] his side all I had to do is get him a
[1:20:22] degree and he had aund and I had a 100
[1:20:25] and there was a half a dozen left that
[1:20:26] couldn't fight
[1:20:28] it
[1:20:30] right but you
[1:20:32] understand something begin to dwell
[1:20:36] within those disciples heart now think
[1:20:38] of yourself what it says think of
[1:20:42] yourselves of your life and your coming
[1:20:44] and where you're
[1:20:46] at say when you first heard of this
[1:20:50] message and see for some reason you
[1:20:53] believed it
[1:20:56] yes maybe you wouldn't even born
[1:20:59] again maybe like me maybe you found out
[1:21:01] you wouldn't born
[1:21:03] again because of the
[1:21:06] message maybe you were born again but
[1:21:09] something started ringing a bell hey you
[1:21:12] know this is
[1:21:14] right that's the most simple I've ever
[1:21:16] heard that scripture explained and the
[1:21:19] Bible just become started becoming alive
[1:21:22] you remember
[1:21:23] it and the things that used to be
[1:21:25] mysterious
[1:21:27] Mysteries you begin to
[1:21:30] gradually
[1:21:33] understand you know the Bible does say
[1:21:35] being born again that's right by The
[1:21:38] Incorruptible word of
[1:21:40] God which is being is a process taking
[1:21:43] place over a long period of
[1:21:46] time
[1:21:50] right but you see we put it on well
[1:21:55] I believe I'm born again cuz I come to
[1:21:56] the message I wouldn't have come to the
[1:21:58] message if that been for that well the
[1:22:00] disciples walk with the message and put
[1:22:03] their life on the line with the
[1:22:05] messenger for three and a half
[1:22:09] years that they were people were
[1:22:11] fighting against their
[1:22:15] master and was putting wanting to put
[1:22:17] him to death and trying to kill him and
[1:22:20] and then you know what they wound up
[1:22:22] getting done the same way
[1:22:25] after they had received what he
[1:22:30] had
[1:22:33] then maybe sometimes it takes a long
[1:22:36] period of time for the new birth to
[1:22:40] process see we want to think oh I I come
[1:22:42] to the
[1:22:48] altar it doesn't make any to to you but
[1:22:53] when I saw what Brandon was talking
[1:22:55] about I said I do not have the new birth
[1:22:59] he was speaking
[1:23:02] of because first
[1:23:04] off I didn't have the
[1:23:08] word I was a trinitarian how many of you
[1:23:12] were that
[1:23:15] right how many of you believed in your
[1:23:17] father or Son and Holy Ghost I remember
[1:23:19] when sister Gail she got to the point
[1:23:22] she be to see the truth of about the the
[1:23:26] understanding of the godhead and you
[1:23:28] know she used to sing with the what
[1:23:30] Atlanta Christian choir course
[1:23:34] on up to the voice like an
[1:23:38] angel right but then she told me one day
[1:23:42] she said I just kind
[1:23:45] of Li
[1:23:47] through that part where it says Father
[1:23:50] Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity you
[1:23:53] just kind of live through it are you
[1:23:54] changing or you you ever do that
[1:23:58] bless right there you go she put
[1:24:00] something else in the place what if
[1:24:03] they' put her on the microphone somebody
[1:24:05] probably run her out of the group she
[1:24:06] wouldn't have been singing with the
[1:24:07] group no more but
[1:24:09] okay see it takes a long time
[1:24:13] sometime few you come to the place that
[1:24:15] actually the spirit could Quicken it cuz
[1:24:18] I want to ask you some simple questions
[1:24:20] now give me a few more minutes
[1:24:25] can God
[1:24:27] Quicken the word that's not
[1:24:31] real see the Trinity can't be revealed
[1:24:33] cuz there's no such thing right I got a
[1:24:36] revelation of the Trinity who'd you get
[1:24:39] it from you had to get him the devil it
[1:24:42] certainly didn't come from God cuz it
[1:24:44] can't be revealed cuz it ain't
[1:24:48] true but that's what we thought
[1:24:52] right see it takes a maybe for that
[1:24:57] word that
[1:24:59] seed that you
[1:25:02] heard to dwell within your soul long
[1:25:05] enough for you to make a
[1:25:10] decision and to see that you're
[1:25:13] lost the prophet said that Jesus
[1:25:16] couldn't get them Pharisees to realize
[1:25:18] they were lost so he could die for them
[1:25:26] now what about us Pharisees and
[1:25:30] Sadducees but I when I heard it I
[1:25:33] believed
[1:25:35] it
[1:25:37] okay but don't talk to me about it
[1:25:41] okay I'm sorry I'm mean hateful and
[1:25:45] arrogant but I remember sometimes when
[1:25:48] it took months and years for to drive
[1:25:52] that Trinity out of you the you would
[1:25:54] tell anybody else later W as quick as I
[1:25:57] saw it I didn't believe that no
[1:26:00] more well why did I have all the
[1:26:03] problems we trying to get you to see the
[1:26:07] truth well brother Dale it just looks
[1:26:09] like this Tre there's got to be
[1:26:11] something I can't
[1:26:12] understand you know I'm sorry I I got
[1:26:15] too good of a
[1:26:19] memory right
[1:26:25] but you see those disciples for three
[1:26:27] and a half
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:29] years heard the
[1:26:31] word the pure unadulterated word
[1:26:36] straight from the mouth of almighty
[1:26:40] God and they still was sitting in the
[1:26:44] upper room like a bunch of scared
[1:26:48] chickens afraid somebody was going to
[1:26:51] open the door any minute and expose them
[1:26:57] but when the Holy Ghost
[1:26:59] came they went right out of
[1:27:03] there to let the world see something had
[1:27:07] happened the word has been given birth
[1:27:10] now quote the prophet paraphrase just a
[1:27:12] her but it's close spoken word's
[1:27:15] Original
[1:27:16] Seed he said they was and he calls them
[1:27:20] seeds I checked that to make sure he
[1:27:23] said those seeds were pulled into the
[1:27:25] upper room which meant 120
[1:27:30] individuals that had believed enough of
[1:27:33] the word to go there and
[1:27:36] wait when the other 380 that had seen
[1:27:39] Jesus after his resurrection did not
[1:27:42] make it to the upper
[1:27:43] room something went wrong the cares of
[1:27:46] Life the threatenings of the parable of
[1:27:49] the of the things throughout the the
[1:27:52] parable of the s
[1:27:56] the 500 of them Rejoice to see his
[1:28:02] resurrection but some what 10 days later
[1:28:05] or
[1:28:06] something they couldn't be
[1:28:08] found but you know what I love about the
[1:28:12] Bible I don't think it plays with words
[1:28:16] I believe those 380 come on to
[1:28:19] Salvation you want me to prove it to you
[1:28:21] in the Bible
[1:28:24] because the Bible called him Brethren to
[1:28:26] start
[1:28:28] with you didn't notice
[1:28:31] that he said he was seen of other F more
[1:28:35] than or something like that 500
[1:28:39] Brethren I believe they come on to the
[1:28:42] truth eventually that's just personal
[1:28:44] that's all right that's not nothing you
[1:28:47] know no argumentative just a
[1:28:52] point but what is the new birth then
[1:28:54] brother
[1:28:55] Dale for 40 something years I've tried
[1:28:58] to explain something to
[1:29:01] you because I've always believed it that
[1:29:04] way since I've seen what had happened to
[1:29:06] me and what I believe the prophet was
[1:29:08] trying to explain in the Bible that
[1:29:10] you're not born again in your body
[1:29:11] you're not born again in your spirit
[1:29:12] you're born again in your soul I've
[1:29:13] tried to teach that for 40 something
[1:29:16] years
[1:29:18] right and some of you would remember it
[1:29:21] cuz my wife brought it back to me last
[1:29:23] night I was listening to them talk I
[1:29:24] like to do that I like to get you into a
[1:29:27] good little discussion and I shut up and
[1:29:29] listen to see if you know what you're
[1:29:31] talking
[1:29:33] about brother collie where you remember
[1:29:36] that I said one of these days I'm going
[1:29:38] to get him into the biggest argument in
[1:29:39] the world with somebody and I'm going to
[1:29:40] back off in the corner and I S it over
[1:29:42] I'm going to find out what this boy
[1:29:43] believes you
[1:29:45] know
[1:29:47] but how many times have you ever heard
[1:29:50] me explain go ahead and pull up now the
[1:29:52] three rings here maybe I can get it in
[1:29:55] 10 minutes all
[1:29:57] right pull up the the the three rings
[1:30:00] brother I know who's there
[1:30:02] brother um brother Bob was back there
[1:30:07] all
[1:30:07] right the three rings of mankind the
[1:30:10] outer part the sea tast SP smell here
[1:30:12] the inner part memories and conscience
[1:30:15] and the Soul as the center which is
[1:30:17] Faith or doubt all right
[1:30:21] now what is the new birth
[1:30:27] the dis the disciples heard the word
[1:30:30] they saw it they could partake of it
[1:30:33] smell you know do the thing they could
[1:30:36] taste the Heavenly gifts they had the
[1:30:38] feelings and
[1:30:40] all they had come into an inner real
[1:30:43] from the outer Court into an inner realm
[1:30:45] until they had come with the affections
[1:30:48] the memory the reason the conscience and
[1:30:51] things of them in their spirit
[1:30:54] real that when they come to that they
[1:30:57] said well we know you've got the words
[1:30:59] of eternal life there ain't nowh else to
[1:31:01] go but remember this as far as it got
[1:31:05] right when the Bible
[1:31:08] says that he breathed on him and said
[1:31:11] receive you the Holy
[1:31:12] Ghost your Prophet explained that right
[1:31:16] what does that mean they did not get it
[1:31:19] right then it was a promise to come now
[1:31:22] I'm going to quote brother
[1:31:26] brandham brother Brenham says you
[1:31:28] believe unto eternal life and he said
[1:31:30] see th the discipl believed on him and
[1:31:32] had eternal
[1:31:39] life now this getting to a spot
[1:31:43] now you can't have eternal life until
[1:31:45] the death of Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ so evidently brother R saying
[1:31:51] something
[1:31:53] I believe you believe un eternal life
[1:31:56] that's right and I believe by
[1:31:59] predestination God knows you're going to
[1:32:02] have eternal
[1:32:03] life so as far as he was concerned the
[1:32:06] disciples already had it but that didn't
[1:32:09] mean they had it in their
[1:32:12] possession
[1:32:15] okay
[1:32:17] now the word out
[1:32:19] here the outer real the C tast field
[1:32:22] smelling here you got to hear it got to
[1:32:24] come in then it goes through your
[1:32:25] memories and and how it goes through
[1:32:28] there I don't understand because all of
[1:32:30] this is garbage can of the best we can
[1:32:32] do with the memory reason but some way
[1:32:35] the birth of the
[1:32:40] Soul so that word coming this far won't
[1:32:43] save
[1:32:44] you the word coming this far won't save
[1:32:49] you amen the word's got to come into
[1:32:52] your being and it took three and a half
[1:32:55] years to drive out that unclean
[1:33:02] spirit and you know that brother randam
[1:33:05] even said
[1:33:06] it to show you how technical the man was
[1:33:10] in his
[1:33:11] wording it hits me how great a man could
[1:33:15] be to say it he said those disciples
[1:33:18] were only potentially
[1:33:20] Justified he said they were only
[1:33:22] potentially San
[1:33:24] he said because Christ had not died
[1:33:28] yet that's right right but you see the
[1:33:32] word they heard drove the unclean Spirit
[1:33:36] out of the man brother Brown said John
[1:33:38] preached
[1:33:40] justification Jesus preached
[1:33:46] sanctification because Jesus preached
[1:33:48] the planning of the word the planning of
[1:33:51] the word into those disciples now the
[1:33:53] day of Pentecost could
[1:33:55] come the Holy Ghost could fall now
[1:33:58] here's where you're going to differ with
[1:33:59] me but you can go ahead and do what you
[1:34:00] want to because I'm just dumb enough to
[1:34:02] Keep On Believing what I believe I'm
[1:34:07] sorry that baptism of the Holy Ghost can
[1:34:10] anoint your
[1:34:11] flesh that baptism of the Holy Ghost can
[1:34:14] anoint your
[1:34:18] spirit
[1:34:20] right does the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] go in your soul
[1:34:25] soul don't answer too quick cuz you
[1:34:27] might
[1:34:29] get clicked a little okay just hold your
[1:34:33] point does the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] go in your
[1:34:41] soul or does it make alive the word
[1:34:45] that's in your
[1:34:49] soul now you're getting somewhere
[1:34:54] it makes alive the word that's in your
[1:34:55] soul it don't have to go in
[1:34:58] there it just
[1:35:00] irrigates quickens makes alive the word
[1:35:05] that you've held within
[1:35:11] you he said but I always thought it was
[1:35:13] the baptism well now you're confused out
[1:35:16] here because you don't know what the
[1:35:17] baptism fits
[1:35:18] in come on I'm not against that we'll
[1:35:21] get through the message I believe the
[1:35:24] Holy Ghost comes
[1:35:25] down and it doesn't matter where you got
[1:35:28] two people standing there and one of
[1:35:30] them winds up being an anointed one the
[1:35:32] other one winds up being a genuine
[1:35:36] Christian the anointed one he's got no
[1:35:40] word in his soul in the P
[1:35:46] Purity he's allowed the cares of Life
[1:35:48] the things to happen to take him over
[1:35:51] he's allowed his church that he's going
[1:35:52] to he's allow lot of things to keep him
[1:35:55] from coming to that inside man would say
[1:35:59] I don't know what I'm disciples I don't
[1:36:02] know what it is but I know one thing you
[1:36:04] got the word of eternal life and if
[1:36:06] there's any hope for me whatsoever let
[1:36:08] me believe
[1:36:11] that
[1:36:14] right when that Holy Ghost came down on
[1:36:17] the day of
[1:36:18] Pentecost it anointed their spirit
[1:36:23] because come on the Bible said in the
[1:36:25] last days you brought my spirit upon All
[1:36:26] Flesh your sons and your
[1:36:28] daughters that's
[1:36:31] Bible sir do you have to put the holy
[1:36:33] spirit
[1:36:35] inside that's okay if you want to say
[1:36:37] that I'm not going to argue with
[1:36:41] you I'm just going to
[1:36:44] say that word that you've took right in
[1:36:46] there is the real
[1:36:49] you that Peter as much as he was and
[1:36:52] even deny but yet he was the one that
[1:36:54] made the confession thou aren't the
[1:36:56] Christ the son of the Living
[1:36:59] God God had made that known to the man
[1:37:03] what was his birth on the day of
[1:37:05] Pentecost that that he had
[1:37:08] said Was Made
[1:37:15] Alive the Holy Spirit comes down through
[1:37:18] does it have to come and dwell
[1:37:21] here see there what we want to call it
[1:37:23] the
[1:37:24] baptism and now you're getting into
[1:37:26] confusion cuz the prophet says you can
[1:37:29] have the
[1:37:30] baptism
[1:37:33] right every day of your life and miss it
[1:37:36] why if that Holy Spirit comes right here
[1:37:39] Why didn't it birth that birth that
[1:37:44] person how come that person don't get
[1:37:47] the new birth then we want to call them
[1:37:48] anointed ones they've got Christianity
[1:37:52] in our they've got Christianity in the
[1:37:54] spirit they've got the anointing of the
[1:37:56] Holy Ghost they got the gifts they got
[1:37:58] the signs they got the Wonders they got
[1:38:00] the love of God they got their
[1:38:03] things but yet they're not forign
[1:38:06] again
[1:38:11] why is God a respector of
[1:38:17] persons cuz you
[1:38:19] see if I've got any ounce of the that
[1:38:23] old man left in me right you remember
[1:38:26] last
[1:38:27] Sunday I tried to express something to
[1:38:30] you where the Bible says it's holy ghost
[1:38:33] in fire that's the scripture brother R
[1:38:37] says all right now that you know
[1:38:39] paraphrasing him he said really when you
[1:38:42] saying it said it's the fire and Holy
[1:38:45] Ghost now he's not correcting the
[1:38:47] scriptures he's just explaining what's
[1:38:50] happening cuz you see when that Holy
[1:38:52] Spirit comes down to here that Holy
[1:38:55] Spirit yes comes in here into the point
[1:38:57] of burning out
[1:38:59] everything that's left of
[1:39:02] you that is not
[1:39:05] right why there's not a lot of New
[1:39:08] Birth because the people don't have the
[1:39:11] word planted in their hearts that's
[1:39:15] right how can God Quicken a trinity
[1:39:19] you're in your makeup your being and
[1:39:20] you're still as trinitarian as can be
[1:39:29] what's
[1:39:30] wrong is God a respect to a person that
[1:39:32] he would anoint this person here and
[1:39:34] that would be you here or anybody else
[1:39:37] here but yet he'll give you the new
[1:39:44] birth
[1:39:47] right it gives you the new birth but to
[1:39:49] the other person it's just
[1:39:52] anointing cuz you see the anointing does
[1:39:54] the same in both
[1:40:00] people the anointing anoints the
[1:40:03] spirit that's right yes
[1:40:06] sir the birth of the word is in the
[1:40:14] soul that word is
[1:40:20] Christ quotes from The Prophet yeah it's
[1:40:23] God and you together as persons now what
[1:40:25] does he
[1:40:28] mean you've got some
[1:40:32] problems is we're trying to say this
[1:40:35] morning the prophet says you grieve that
[1:40:38] Holy Spirit he said he goes out on the
[1:40:42] limb now are he lost when he goes out on
[1:40:45] the
[1:40:49] limb if all you can deal with is in here
[1:40:52] and he comes out of here here then
[1:40:54] you're leaving the person lost or
[1:40:56] unregenerated you see what I mean for 40
[1:40:59] years I've tried to explain
[1:41:04] that because I saw what your Prophet was
[1:41:08] saying that anointing come down upon the
[1:41:11] spirit of
[1:41:13] mankind pour it out on All Flesh
[1:41:18] right but why didn't it give birth to
[1:41:21] all
[1:41:23] because they never had the word swn into
[1:41:26] their
[1:41:27] hearts and you say well brother
[1:41:32] Dale and for 40 years or more going into
[1:41:37] 50
[1:41:39] now started in
[1:41:42] 1971
[1:41:45] preaching first message was
[1:41:50] 1969 and you know it was so odd the
[1:41:52] message I preached in
[1:41:55] 1969 that the Bride of Jesus Christ was
[1:41:58] the son of
[1:42:03] man cuz that's what I
[1:42:08] understood you said brother Dale now the
[1:42:11] disciples we've seen them they took the
[1:42:14] word they held the word it drove that
[1:42:16] unclean Spirit out of them it planted
[1:42:19] the word into that Soul into that being
[1:42:22] of Peter to where that he was standing
[1:42:25] there but what was he he was a seed he
[1:42:29] was rened out enough but he needed a
[1:42:34] life and that lick of fire came down on
[1:42:37] the day of
[1:42:39] Pentecost and brother Brandon said went
[1:42:41] on each one of them he said and went
[1:42:43] into
[1:42:45] their
[1:42:49] soul and
[1:42:51] quickened the word
[1:42:53] that's right you mean I've got to
[1:42:56] understand every see I try to pick up
[1:42:57] the mind if you're thinking you mean
[1:42:59] I've got to understand everything Peter
[1:43:00] understood no no no no Martin Luther
[1:43:04] Martin Luther was a man he was all into
[1:43:07] the trouble it was but he fought the
[1:43:09] Catholic church he they had protested
[1:43:11] Catholic Church people had before Luther
[1:43:13] come along and Luther was right in that
[1:43:16] protest against her
[1:43:17] systems and when he was all at once
[1:43:21] something happened when he was reading
[1:43:23] Romans and he said do Jo shall live by
[1:43:25] faith did that make p that make Luther
[1:43:29] quit drinking did it make him stop
[1:43:31] smoking a poipe no because he didn't
[1:43:33] have the word to take that out of him
[1:43:36] but he had enough word that he said the
[1:43:40] just shall live by faith we don't have
[1:43:42] to do these penances we don't have to go
[1:43:45] to the pope we go straight to Jesus
[1:43:48] Christ amen for our Salvation yes sir
[1:43:52] amen and you know what that was the
[1:43:58] birth John
[1:44:00] Wesley believed and taught what Luther
[1:44:04] taught now you want some records of it I
[1:44:06] got some books at home if you'd like to
[1:44:07] read
[1:44:08] them John
[1:44:10] Wesley he never was the first one to
[1:44:13] come up with
[1:44:14] sanctification he got on the boat headed
[1:44:16] to America matter of fact he came to
[1:44:18] Georgia right and in his journey he was
[1:44:23] coming over here as a missionary under
[1:44:25] the just shall live by
[1:44:29] faith but yet he had seen everything had
[1:44:32] went so far away from Luther's real
[1:44:34] correct teaching of the just shall live
[1:44:37] by faith by Revelation that the man was
[1:44:40] sincerely seing for God what's
[1:44:43] wrong what's a
[1:44:48] matter you know what God used
[1:44:51] somebody every how you pronounce it
[1:44:53] moravians or moravians or
[1:44:56] something they were the original
[1:44:58] teachers of sanctification he was on
[1:45:00] that boat headed here they taught him
[1:45:03] the truth you know what he come back
[1:45:04] home he said I went to America to
[1:45:07] convert the Heathen he said come to find
[1:45:09] out I was a heathen myself and needed to
[1:45:12] be converted then it was as a prophet
[1:45:15] calls it the new birth of
[1:45:21] sanctification fell in into a man's
[1:45:24] heart there were a lot of protests and
[1:45:27] things right around the turn of the
[1:45:29] century against those things and theusa
[1:45:32] Street was not the original teachings of
[1:45:35] one God the zeusa street was
[1:45:39] trinitarians Daddy Seymour and those men
[1:45:42] they were still
[1:45:43] trinitarians but yet they felt that call
[1:45:46] in their lives that to see that the
[1:45:49] people had gotten away from the real
[1:45:51] truth and to begin to C C out and God
[1:45:54] answered that with gifts and signs and
[1:45:55] wonders but we just put it all they got
[1:45:57] was gifts now they got the person of
[1:45:59] Jesus Christ you want me to quote
[1:46:00] brother
[1:46:05] random he said the Holy Ghost came
[1:46:09] himself on the day of
[1:46:11] Pentecost it's about 464 seal book he
[1:46:17] said another great
[1:46:21] prophet he calls isusa Street a great
[1:46:25] prophet he said but then like
[1:46:28] others at the end of the
[1:46:32] age he said then the messenger came who
[1:46:36] was brother
[1:46:40] brandham ausa Street came forth with the
[1:46:43] birth of the word not just
[1:46:48] gifts the birth of the
[1:46:51] word each age has been the birth of the
[1:46:55] word may I quote the Bible have you
[1:46:58] received the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:00] since you
[1:47:03] believe have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:47:05] after hearing of this
[1:47:09] message what do you mean I had it I
[1:47:11] wouldn't come in message well the
[1:47:13] devil's here did he get
[1:47:17] it now get away from stuff like that cuz
[1:47:20] that's that's junk in your mind
[1:47:25] well don't you think that God led me I
[1:47:27] said it I believe God led me into this
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:35] message but then this message brought
[1:47:38] Christ to me and I seen that I didn't
[1:47:42] have that new birth that's right and I
[1:47:45] cried out to God to receive it and it
[1:47:47] took two years to get enough word
[1:47:51] planted to where the holy GH ghost could
[1:47:56] fall two
[1:47:58] years that I've read six books in one
[1:48:01] day and listen to two
[1:48:05] tapes brother col is witness to a lot of
[1:48:07] it all I done was read I set up there
[1:48:10] where he was at working me and him was
[1:48:12] talking about the Lord or just sitting
[1:48:14] down there all day long A lot of times
[1:48:17] reading I've told you about it and you
[1:48:19] just you look at me like I'm crazy or
[1:48:20] something the man I worked with on his
[1:48:23] end of the table he had Playboy
[1:48:24] magazines we had a table for our desk
[1:48:27] for working he had Playboy magazines he
[1:48:29] had filthy on the other end I had the
[1:48:31] Bible and the prophet's
[1:48:34] message well brother Dale is
[1:48:38] you brother see brother
[1:48:47] said I'm a human
[1:48:50] being we don't have to expl explain that
[1:48:54] there was just something inside that was
[1:48:58] controlling till even told you about the
[1:49:00] time that he told me and I was speaking
[1:49:02] on the pyramids here and he told me he
[1:49:04] said Playboy magazine has got an article
[1:49:07] on the pyramids of
[1:49:09] Egypt I said would you bring it and let
[1:49:11] me read
[1:49:13] it I was sitting in the office he was
[1:49:16] outside working we changed positions but
[1:49:18] we were up I was sitting there reading
[1:49:20] the Playboy magazine
[1:49:23] and a man come walking down the line and
[1:49:24] looked over oh he found a preacher he's
[1:49:27] in there reading Playboy magazines this
[1:49:30] was a great big Husky built white guy
[1:49:33] Luther
[1:49:34] Beck some of them here knows him he
[1:49:38] grabbed that guy and he slammed him
[1:49:40] against the office and he said he's not
[1:49:43] reading that he's studying on something
[1:49:46] that he is preaching on as his church
[1:49:49] and you know that was never mentioned
[1:49:51] again
[1:49:55] he was willing to fight that man over
[1:49:58] me Tom asked him one day when he found
[1:50:02] out that Tom knew about brother
[1:50:05] brandham Tom said how did you learn
[1:50:07] about he said Sam Dale he said what do
[1:50:09] you think of Sam Dale on a scale from 1
[1:50:11] to 10 he said he's an
[1:50:16] 11 that's what he
[1:50:20] said because he knew what I
[1:50:24] was day by
[1:50:27] day but church do you understand what
[1:50:30] the new birth is you've got to hear the
[1:50:33] word it's got to clean that unclean
[1:50:35] Spirit out it's not because you quit
[1:50:37] drinking you quit smoking you quit doing
[1:50:40] those things it's when that inside man
[1:50:42] drives out through the spirit through
[1:50:44] into the body and it cleanses you by the
[1:50:47] washing of the water of the
[1:50:50] word that's right yeah and then you got
[1:50:53] the birth of a
[1:50:55] baby you know what we don't like that
[1:50:58] but it's still true I don't care how old
[1:51:02] you were the day you reive the new birth
[1:51:05] you got the new birth as a baby Desiring
[1:51:09] the sincere milk of the word that you
[1:51:11] may grow thereby you may think you had a
[1:51:14] lot of head knowledge I could quote a
[1:51:16] lot of the
[1:51:17] Bible studied the Bible that was my
[1:51:20] whole thing
[1:51:23] but yet I
[1:51:26] realized and brother Mo said brother
[1:51:28] Dale I can't figure you out he said
[1:51:30] there
[1:51:31] something he said I know you're not
[1:51:34] trying to find some something that you
[1:51:37] could do or not do and it would bring
[1:51:39] you to a Salvation that you'd accept he
[1:51:42] said but you got to remember one
[1:51:45] thing he said he is the
[1:51:49] word and said the new birth is the birth
[1:51:53] of that
[1:51:56] word and you know that was
[1:51:59] it that was the day I received the new
[1:52:05] birth you know what that come to me as a
[1:52:10] revelation the new birth was no longer a
[1:52:13] mystery it was something that had been
[1:52:15] revealed to me did you understand
[1:52:17] everything no still don't ever
[1:52:20] understand everything
[1:52:23] but I
[1:52:24] saw Christ as the
[1:52:28] word and I said Thank You
[1:52:31] Lord my wife right beside of me fell one
[1:52:35] way and I fell the other
[1:52:37] way we all kind of laugh about it cuz
[1:52:40] there was no drunk sitting on the front
[1:52:42] row down at Holly Hots and he was at
[1:52:44] sitting on that front row and when we
[1:52:46] got down to pray and I went fell one way
[1:52:49] and she fell the other way and she fell
[1:52:51] right under that old drunk's
[1:52:53] feet he was just looking at her he
[1:52:57] trying to get over you know but you know
[1:52:59] what it didn't bother
[1:53:02] her she didn't get upset excuse me I'll
[1:53:04] go lay down somewhere else you know no
[1:53:07] she didn't I have no control over
[1:53:10] that it just ended that
[1:53:14] situation she brought it back to me last
[1:53:16] night she said you've always taught that
[1:53:19] it's the birth of the word
[1:53:24] well I can't see any other birth what is
[1:53:26] it that's right you explain to me what
[1:53:29] it
[1:53:30] is you tell me something that Satan
[1:53:32] can't
[1:53:33] impersonate
[1:53:37] right but what did Brother R say the
[1:53:39] thing he can't do he can't bring the
[1:53:42] word word by
[1:53:47] word he said he can't do
[1:53:50] it that's right I hope I hope you
[1:53:52] understand if not I wish you would do me
[1:53:54] a favor and go back and listen to this
[1:53:56] tape about three times before you say
[1:53:58] anything to anybody else that I don't
[1:54:01] agree with brother Dale because of so
[1:54:02] and so and so and so would you go back
[1:54:04] and listen to the tape and see if what I
[1:54:06] said you owe me that
[1:54:09] respect but you won't do
[1:54:12] it you'll go away telling people you
[1:54:15] don't agree with that cuz I believed
[1:54:17] that I believe when I got it I cried I
[1:54:19] was there today I got well I ain't
[1:54:21] saying you didn't get it
[1:54:23] right but I'm saying one thing for
[1:54:27] certain may I quote brother
[1:54:32] Brandon he said if you got the Holy
[1:54:34] Ghost speaking in tongues he said it is
[1:54:37] not according to the
[1:54:44] Bible now do you need that
[1:54:48] quote he said it's not according to the
[1:54:51] Bible
[1:54:54] see because we put the tongues and the
[1:54:56] things the head put the birth first and
[1:54:58] then shout and Glory Hallelujah all you
[1:55:00] want to cuz what did we read when we
[1:55:02] reading brother Brown said it's a
[1:55:05] life he never done away with saying that
[1:55:09] the evidence of the Holy Ghost was the
[1:55:11] Life of Christ show me
[1:55:14] that but we want to say that well he
[1:55:17] done away because it could be the love
[1:55:18] anybody man fact love
[1:55:23] but he never taught that it wasn't an
[1:55:25] experience and that the Life of Christ
[1:55:27] was supposed to live in us after the New
[1:55:30] Birth comes because before then we're
[1:55:32] only saying what somebody else said amen
[1:55:36] that's right you can't call Jesus the
[1:55:38] Christ except by the Holy Ghost I quote
[1:55:41] the prophet except by the baptism of the
[1:55:43] Holy Ghost the new birth cuz you're
[1:55:45] saying what somebody else
[1:55:50] says forgive me for being hard this
[1:55:54] afternoon but remember 40 something
[1:55:57] years I've tried to explain
[1:56:03] this I'm not against
[1:56:06] nobody I love
[1:56:09] everybody no matter what you do to me or
[1:56:12] have done to me or whatever that has
[1:56:13] nothing to do with anything and this man
[1:56:15] you're looking
[1:56:17] at because this man has one thing in the
[1:56:20] mind and that is to try to serve Jesus
[1:56:29] Christ and I know I make the statement
[1:56:31] and you don't some people don't like it
[1:56:33] but the men that's helped me the most in
[1:56:35] this message was the men that hurt me
[1:56:37] the
[1:56:41] most can you say
[1:56:44] that can you say that the ones that
[1:56:46] helped you the most was the ones that
[1:56:48] hurt you the
[1:56:49] most no you say the ones I don't don't
[1:56:52] like was one to hurt
[1:56:56] me you know they made you
[1:56:59] think they made you consider they made
[1:57:02] you
[1:57:06] pray I've always told you we were
[1:57:08] referring to it last night I was a kind
[1:57:11] of a
[1:57:12] person and I'll finish with this
[1:57:15] thought I could understand in the old
[1:57:17] days that when they they would just get
[1:57:19] a word of mouth and you don't get mad at
[1:57:21] each other what and they would just take
[1:57:23] their handkerchief out and they'd just
[1:57:25] slap a man in the face with a
[1:57:26] handkerchief and I'll meet you in the
[1:57:28] morning at
[1:57:32] daylight you know what man would go and
[1:57:36] they'd take two guns and they'd stand
[1:57:38] off certain Paces with each other and
[1:57:41] they shot each
[1:57:43] other I can understand that because the
[1:57:47] greatest insults you can give a person
[1:57:49] is to slap their
[1:57:50] jaws don't please slap your children in
[1:57:54] the
[1:57:55] jws get you
[1:57:57] a I know the football guy got into
[1:58:00] trouble by using a little paddle but at
[1:58:03] least nobody hadn't gotten into trouble
[1:58:04] yet using a little Hickory so get you a
[1:58:06] little Hickory and kind of work on the
[1:58:08] other end you know surprisingly it gets
[1:58:10] back up to the
[1:58:13] head right but don't slap them in the
[1:58:16] Jaws my brother-in-law hit my nephew so
[1:58:20] hard underneath until he knocked his
[1:58:23] intestines
[1:58:27] out don't do
[1:58:30] it you get
[1:58:34] mad but you see I always wondered if
[1:58:37] somebody slap my jaws could I take
[1:58:40] it and I have had ever right to hurt a
[1:58:43] man that work because I've told you
[1:58:45] about it he kept pinching me between the
[1:58:47] legs in the wrong place and I told him

[1:58:53] touch somebody in the wrong place don't
[1:58:55] do it
[1:58:56] now and I caught him one day sitting on
[1:58:58] the table and I meant
[1:59:01] to I didn't pray to be forgiven before I
[1:59:04] went and done
[1:59:06] it I just knew what I was going to do
[1:59:09] and I went over and I put my hands on
[1:59:10] his knees and I looked him in the eye
[1:59:13] and I raised up and if you want to hurt
[1:59:15] somebody do that to him when I came down
[1:59:18] he came off of that table straight up
[1:59:20] cuz it was just total I mean I bounced
[1:59:22] him off the table and when he did he
[1:59:24] slapped my jaws plow not
[1:59:30] easy I stood and looked at
[1:59:33] him I grin at

[1:59:41] word he just slid off that
[1:59:44] table and he he went to work he never
[1:59:48] touched me again in the wrong place but
[1:59:50] you know he stayed away from me about an
[1:59:52] hour or so I guess he figured he needed
[1:59:53] to let me calm down you know but you
[1:59:56] know what I never had no part or thought
[1:59:59] about hitting him
[2:00:01] back I said Thank You Lord I needed
[2:00:05] that you ever heard brother Brown say
[2:00:08] that God will let somebody say something

[2:01:12] again something's taking
[2:01:14] place now that unclean spirit is drove
[2:01:17] out of the soul but that unclean spirit
[2:01:20] is still dwelling in our body and our
[2:01:22] spirit even till this day now if you
[2:01:25] don't agree with that there's something
[2:01:26] wrong with
