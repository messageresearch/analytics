[6:04] of this stuff about you know we're
[6:06] supposed to play tapes now and the
[6:07] fivefold ministry don't weigh with I
[6:09] warned another who got the authority to
[6:12] say that because I'll show you where the
[6:14] Bible says it is to continue and I'll
[6:17] show you where the Prophet says is to
[6:18] continue children you can do what you
[6:21] want to want your time I believe the way
[6:23] we here is by the fivefold ministry
[6:26] don't fight cometh by hearing hearing by
[6:28] the word of the Lord let's just sing
[6:30] that under the motor open the eyes of my
[6:34] heart Lord open the eyes of my

[7:37] [Music]
[7:57] me
[7:58] [Music]
[8:10] elderly if you want you could be seated
[8:15] for gesture we love to greet each and
[8:21] everyone in the precious name again the
[8:23] Lord Jesus Christ just still alive and
[8:26] well amongst people doing what he
[8:29] promised and fulfilling his word amen
[8:34] and I'm so grateful to see some that
[8:37] maybe for the first time email let's
[8:40] make it plain it's not my first time
[8:43] here today Matt and I each time I come I
[8:48] just feel welcome and everything just
[8:52] just right rest I'll write like a
[8:56] crystal anyway and so sometimes at home
[9:03] we all seem likely rest enough and here
[9:08] there and everywhere so sometimes when I
[9:13] come and can come here and things like
[9:16] that get rest up get feed up get such a
[9:21] lot some weight and I believe since I
[9:24] come I began to gain them back a man
[9:28] believe the Lord is really doing
[9:31] something in this last days in the
[9:35] church back home still going on amen and
[9:38] we hope to go on for till the rapture
[9:41] yeah that's what we are waiting on then
[9:44] I'm great change is a spoken word of God
[9:50] I mean there is going to be rubber
[9:54] as a body a man just calling pudding
[9:58] pudding pudding right a man not believe
[10:02] this something to put in and that one I
[10:05] believe it's got more power so it won't
[10:08] be too long
[10:09] amen the great eternal change will come
[10:14] on and I'm looking for it because it's
[10:17] promised by Jesus Christ amen and every
[10:22] one of God's promise will be fulfilled
[10:26] in the natural I'm just getting to hate
[10:29] this body man hey man I think I said
[10:36] that my last Sunday in church I said I
[10:40] don't like college and I don't like I
[10:42] don't believe you God really feel bad
[10:45] when I say that amen I have a lot of
[10:50] things to do and you sold me back and
[10:53] for the Lord and for myself
[10:58] amen it means and that it comes you know
[11:02] you have to have money if some of us
[11:04] don't worry the insurance and things
[11:07] like that so we feel it on every side
[11:10] remember gives a great promise and it's
[11:15] not too far to be manifested is that
[11:21] right Amy want the only Disney move I
[11:27] could pull out my fast it won't need
[11:30] them
[11:33] you want you know walking stick again to
[11:36] help us and it's kind of mad at me
[11:40] amen and I'm looking forward a man for
[11:44] that promise to be fulfilled and we are
[11:49] Abraham's children and thinking that
[11:52] happen to Abraham not to us
[11:54] is that right amen
[11:58] but knowing that it was full filled like
[12:04] sometimes the river Branum puts it and
[12:06] sage and knowing that is supposed to
[12:09] happen to us - amen that theophany is
[12:15] calling me
[12:18] amen and I believe amen I'm answering
[12:23] right is that right like those there in
[12:27] Revelation hold on hold on
[12:30] is that right somebody asked my question
[12:34] about that
[12:36] amen to be fulfilled he meant come a day
[12:41] without us I will not be made every
[12:48] person that right right that's what it
[12:56] scripture said day we don't owe
[13:01] so we bit a shaper amen it is because
[13:07] they're having that feeling also oh but
[13:11] it shall be
[13:13] come on we'll fill
[13:15] praise the Lord man I believe if I was
[13:18] at home I would be right at the pulpit
[13:21] at this very moment and things like that
[13:24] so I'm not really scared or anything
[13:29] like that because I would be home doing
[13:31] the same fear amen
[13:35] let us see the warm faces and the smiles
[13:37] and things like that and everywhere too
[13:41] so we learned that and we understand it
[13:44] and so each time I see my precious
[13:50] friend got a Dale and remember
[13:53] couple years ago a man I met him first I
[13:57] know that there was something you think
[13:59] that I want to pull oh I remember to
[14:05] better keep that your brother Keith
[14:07] let's plan of service because that man
[14:10] has got something for us
[14:13] amen
[14:14] but I see my church and his church
[14:17] something like that
[14:19] and let's see people get all little
[14:22] groups together because that man I've
[14:25] got something to tell us
[14:29] amen
[14:32] and I believe if Amanda was the holy
[14:36] spirit doing that I always say that and
[14:41] so we are happy to know we are still in
[14:44] that word Phyllis
[14:48] amen there's so many things going around
[14:50] Oh that breaks our heart and sometimes
[14:54] way back there we hear of names that
[14:58] follow better than a message for 40
[15:00] years
[15:01] amen and then I don't know because when
[15:03] you leave this where can you go
[15:09] and but that's a part of it it's got to
[15:11] be that way I Drive amen
[15:14] it's got to be that way with a Julia saw
[15:19] this or that you thought right
[15:22] and you had to sit there on to his time
[15:24] come on
[15:26] but the bottom set is going to be three
[15:28] kinds of believers is that right amen
[15:34] so my all will come for the rapture
[15:36] somebody else our will come just like
[15:39] Pharaoh email just like Judas amen
[15:44] because it's the Prophet puts it down in
[15:47] this world so I don't really get drunk
[15:52] or anything like that come back up and
[15:57] good friend of mine from Trinidad
[16:00] creatures lives in the States and didn't
[16:05] seem for a couple years and things like
[16:06] that but italic was the phrase Lord and
[16:09] things like that then he shot attorneys
[16:11] to God's a mean I sit and listen
[16:19] amen because I know the Bible said what
[16:24] the Bible said Yero Ezra the Lord your
[16:30] God is one God
[16:35] have to have a revelation for that I
[16:39] remember when the revelation King to be
[16:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:44] Christ I was sitting in my Church of God
[16:48] that first baptism father son Holy Ghost
[16:53] but when I heard Amen that you got to be
[16:57] baptized in name of the Lord Jesus
[16:58] Christ I know that there was something
[17:02] really a man
[17:06] but couple of us and start to pray pray
[17:09] pray pray God still I'm surprised and
[17:13] standing here every time I remember that
[17:16] Macedonia call Hansard and we get
[17:21] together when service over and night
[17:25] something like that night services and
[17:27] we stare on that flat concrete cold and
[17:32] things like that not like overhearing
[17:34] hope but we stay there all night and we
[17:37] pray Lord send somebody send somebody so
[17:45] I know what Matty Donna called done for
[17:48] me when I read a Bible and what those
[17:53] preachers was saying was so far off amen
[17:59] and then we began to pray God
[18:04] unsuppressed
[18:06] send brother green over Amen I remember
[18:13] that Sunday morning just like this they
[18:16] really stayed here and for the first
[18:19] time what many ministries minister is
[18:23] going to be around that area
[18:25] and I remember it came out just like all
[18:30] your sit down their church was just the
[18:32] same maybe same amount of people at the
[18:34] time and he was just looking and looking
[18:36] and looking and he said if you are going
[18:40] to start start right because if you
[18:45] don't start right you won't in right
[18:49] didn't even know what it was to say same
[18:53] but the perfect cook came and he took
[18:57] his message and we going to preach a
[19:00] Matt and baptism and I like her I may
[19:09] say they were ready here but I just say
[19:11] it again come maybe somebody wasn't here
[19:13] a mentor now Holy God's Word is when you
[19:19] hunger for God Alleluia can he keep
[19:25] looking looking and he said if you're
[19:28] going to start start right another time
[19:35] there was in Jamaica a group going
[19:39] around Black Power Group Lynette there
[19:43] was over here I never said they were
[19:46] trying to get a young ones say don't
[19:51] worry King James Version because these
[19:53] white this was just written for white
[19:58] people and some people caught on to it
[20:03] oh we thought is strange
[20:06] and so when you begun to talk about the
[20:11] baptism and things like that
[20:13] Amen and bring them scriptures and so
[20:17] forth but the green will go as far as
[20:19] you can
[20:20] just like a bullet out of a gun and you
[20:22] gotta ride fast and we try to get some
[20:25] of the Scriptures done because we talk
[20:28] he took her some kind of American
[20:30] baggage that we didn't have but we went
[20:41] over and we took Oh a bad thing four of
[20:45] us and we begun to search the Scriptures
[20:52] Jesus's surface scriptures amen we began
[20:58] to fulfill that script ribbon on a
[21:00] search and we found though that is same
[21:03] Bible he was preaching the same Bible
[21:07] been reading for years but we never
[21:12] heard anything about that never see them
[21:15] scriptures I was on the schoolteacher
[21:18] but I've never seen that he got to be
[21:20] baptized Jesus name and so we decided to
[21:27] get baptized so one of the reading said
[21:32] we'd have to tell the pastor so he
[21:39] decided to go so he went on he totally
[21:42] passive pastor we just love you and he
[21:45] was a gifted man pray for the sick and
[21:47] you couldn't deny we love him real real
[21:51] real pastor good pasta when he goes off
[21:55] the word dance and so he said he can do
[22:00] it he's not going to do it so he said we
[22:04] can ask brother Hannah greeny people
[22:06] dirty say yes so we asked and he said
[22:10] yes he will do it just have copied ate
[22:13] on the island and so we trying to work
[22:16] fast as you could can we taught you to
[22:19] be alright so we stayed up again all
[22:25] night actually Saturday night and we're
[22:28] going to go to the ocean to get baptized
[22:31] and so I'm sure we talk and we talk and
[22:38] we go over back being Scriptures use a
[22:40] truck by baptized in Jesus name when God
[22:44] the common man and I think I read them
[22:47] things that someone good to us and so
[22:51] decide we've been to take a nap and I
[22:56] don't know they got up before I got up
[22:59] and said are you going but a Brady has
[23:02] hidden no sir you've all gone I do it
[23:05] another time
[23:08] tobacco are they winter and get by the
[23:15] Green River was staying there in his
[23:18] house and they went on down to the ocean
[23:22] and I went back to sleep
[23:24] could be a vision or a dream and it
[23:26] mixed up with that sometimes and I saw
[23:31] like a white woman all dressed in way
[23:37] and things like that and in that little
[23:41] dream I call it I was going this way and
[23:44] she was coming to me this way on the
[23:47] beach white sand and she had on white
[23:49] tears no and as we come together just
[23:56] like that she said are we going to
[23:58] baptize this morning I said no man no
[24:01] man and she said it three times and I
[24:05] said no man and I woke up and I could
[24:09] hear of all I said no man and I look
[24:11] around in the room and I didn't see them
[24:13] and then it comes back to me that we
[24:16] also go together so I just get some
[24:19] clothes and I run two miles
[24:22] they have ready been baptized was coming
[24:25] back I say you take me down
[24:31] and so it happened that way and so from
[24:37] there I started father spray it up and a
[24:40] man honest I used to go to the Baptist
[24:44] Church where I used to work couple of us
[24:47] there and there's a Sunday off and
[24:50] things like that it was go but I
[24:53] couldn't take in those doctrine just sit
[24:57] there so definitely I never really
[25:01] wanted to join any church I wanted God
[25:05] in my soul I wanted the real God in my
[25:12] soul and that's how they be going to
[25:17] pray and we get hungry for God and
[25:19] fasting and praying and things like that
[25:21] and then it's happened
[25:25] hey man they turn us over to church we
[25:28] didn't know where to go because we
[25:30] didn't know any Pentecostal Church at
[25:33] things like that so we start to preach
[25:35] on the street and so forth and they
[25:40] thought it strange but we see God in His
[25:43] Word and we try to stay with it
[25:48] we go in further still praying still
[25:51] praying still praying this is 9 to 6 6
[25:55] to 1 for the green came to Jamaica 6 to
[25:58] 2 he gave me an invitation to the United
[26:01] States went and I got my visa was
[26:06] another brother but brown and so forth
[26:08] he knew about but abandoned but I didn't
[26:10] know him or anything like that he was a
[26:12] bishop the Pentecostal church was here
[26:15] and sober both of us came over here and
[26:21] it was so strange when I come because
[26:24] maybe holidays are life is you see black
[26:26] people black people I was working for
[26:30] white anyhow so I kind of have a little
[26:34] knowledge about the way but when I came
[26:37] here it was so different
[26:40] very mad and I'm just still in my
[26:45] testimony Loretta's hotel were here and
[26:49] then he said but a brady brother branham
[26:55] is going to be in Southern Pines
[26:58] but Papa Thomas Church and so he said we
[27:04] are going over there and he took me and
[27:10] brother Brown over there and I want to
[27:14] tell you church for the first time I've
[27:17] heard about billig Ryan heard about
[27:20] shaggers heard about all the Evangelist
[27:24] great vandalism for America in those
[27:28] days and so forth and things like that
[27:31] but I've never heard read the band he's
[27:36] a good magazines from the Church of God
[27:39] and things like that and so that morning
[27:47] was a special morning as I said I've
[27:52] never heard of his name never nice at
[27:57] there and brother Brown we open the
[28:00] front and when that man walked out from
[28:04] that little room he would come to the
[28:09] puppy just like this and he said good
[28:12] morning friends there is some feelings
[28:18] quite different first I'm going to sing
[28:24] and I just look at him and I know I've
[28:28] been reading the book of Acts and I said
[28:31] that's the church I want to be there got
[28:34] to be a church like that I always say
[28:39] that visit churches and churches but I
[28:42] said I don't know but when I read the
[28:45] book of Acts I said Dutch Church it got
[28:47] to be on her its own area I will not see
[28:50] that man for the first time
[28:51] walk OH
[28:52] I said that's the man I remember he said
[29:05] start we said there is some people going
[29:09] around and said the coming of the Lord
[29:15] is already happened
[29:20] they are in the Millennium didn't know
[29:24] too much about those things but I like
[29:28] to tell them the coming of the Lord is
[29:33] different said this is the appearing of
[29:38] the Lord he's appearing now but the
[29:43] coming is different I heard him say that
[29:48] brother Brown because a seen a preacher
[29:52] seen a bishop and things like that they
[29:55] know it's all their bishops he said give
[29:59] me system and he said after but a parent
[30:02] looks straight over where I was sitting
[30:04] and he said said those things
[30:07] he said brother Brady we have a group
[30:10] from America have them at home for all
[30:13] week and as a doctrine day was putting
[30:17] down and things like that but I just
[30:24] believe what better balancing the coming
[30:28] of the Lord is different from the
[30:30] appearing and he said that still I don't
[30:34] know anything about brother Branham or
[30:36] anything like that but when the prayer
[30:42] line came I saw the way he operated and
[30:47] God was so good the church I was
[30:49] visiting and Charlotte or inhibits until
[30:52] somewhere here there was a sister in
[30:55] there wanted a child for couple years
[30:58] after marriage and Jim told 11 year she
[31:01] said and better Bannon pointed her out
[31:06] and said go home get everything for your
[31:08] baby son this way and I kept up with but

[37:25] way prophets say oh we're little crew we
[37:29] waited until the church could be go 8:30
[37:33] see the people walking down so I walk
[37:38] with you let me get off near near near
[37:42] to the door
[37:43] until we heard like somebody's inside
[37:48] then finally the door open when it were
[37:52] open
[37:52] Oh Lord right so they rush like I would
[38:02] say back there I didn't know why people
[38:05] get rough sometimes we taught him so
[38:10] soft ever for them but the way they
[38:14] react should go through that door but a
[38:17] rolling sliding a little bit and when I
[38:19] got to make it I could make it cut the
[38:23] door was just crowned and I didn't want
[38:26] to push and Russian squeeze anybody cuz
[38:30] I was going like that fearful and see if
[38:34] it was home I know I would just and I
[38:41] slide one of these times and I just get
[38:45] up his right side by the ropes and who
[38:48] my heart is but I don't know if I
[38:51] squeeze anybody or things like that
[38:53] trying to look over my shoulder to see
[38:55] anybody and things like that so anyway
[39:00] everything was alright I took the letter
[39:04] when I was going this time it is my coat
[39:06] pocket and to happen again when that man
[39:12] come from that door come to the pulpit
[39:17] something different and he will be
[39:19] looking just like this and when it said
[39:24] is here again there's a holy horse

[39:31] the whole place if you drop a pin you
[39:35] could hear it I know something funny was
[39:39] you understand but I don't understand it
[39:42] and it will be just looking looking just

[39:46] the any City is here since when he said
[39:50] he is here is another feeling full
[39:55] Oh Lord and he would just look then he
[40:03] would exalt and then he would go
[40:05] straight to the words that morning he
[40:08] preached the anointed ones in the end
[40:10] times I could not understand because I
[40:15] already get mixed up with Pentecost no

[1:01:25] was granted that she should be arrayed
[1:01:30] in fine linen clean and white for the
[1:01:36] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:01:40] same this is the word of the Lord I
[1:01:48] believe we all believe the word of the
[1:01:50] Lord came l want to give God thanks amen
[1:02:00] and I wonder maybe I read this last time
[1:02:06] I just wander fallacy
[1:02:12] again we are living church when it comes
[1:02:20] to the revelation of the Word of God
[1:02:26] this little Gentile bride gay men
[1:02:34] getting herself ready
[1:02:37] is that right and this is from Tommy
[1:02:44] Osbourne one to preach brother Branham
[1:02:49] right memorial service and I picked this
[1:02:58] up and I ever wanted to meet him I don't
[1:03:04] know if he still alive but I really
[1:03:07] wanted was to meet him in the last time
[1:03:10] because he said something that I would
[1:03:13] say and he said this was the closing
[1:03:19] revelation something had to happen it
[1:03:23] couldn't go as past regulate generations
[1:03:28] and God this one is it like it there for
[1:03:35] in God's divine mercy somehow stepping
[1:03:40] beyond the bound of ordinary measure he
[1:03:45] had four ordained at this hour to send
[1:03:49] again this prophet some are going to
[1:03:55] think I am suffragists are off
[1:03:57] doctrinally and it doesn't really matter
[1:04:01] but God came again I like that word
[1:04:05] again in human flesh and said apparently
[1:04:13] i'ma show them again I must remind them
[1:04:20] again they must see
[1:04:25] one more time once again they must know
[1:04:31] what God is like and he stepped down and
[1:04:39] sent a little man a prophet but more
[1:04:44] than a prophet this time Jesus man
[1:04:50] this time Elijah was not there this
[1:04:55] which we have beheld is more than Moses
[1:05:01] was not that for because of the
[1:05:05] different dispensation in which he lived
[1:05:09] it couldn't be what we have seen more
[1:05:14] than that a Jesus man a man full of God
[1:05:20] but sent as a special sign to a
[1:05:25] generation a generation supernatural
[1:05:30] sign an extraordinary measure why it was
[1:05:36] done before why do it again to assure
[1:05:42] this last generation once more to be the
[1:05:48] poor runner once more to be sure the
[1:05:53] record is clean hallelujah once more to
[1:06:02] be sure that is no excuse and to be sure
[1:06:09] that God has demonstrated afresh to be
[1:06:14] sure there can be no mistake and to be
[1:06:19] sure that we are reminded afresh of what
[1:06:23] God is like how Jesus was and what God
[1:06:31] but get this now doesn't flesh to be
[1:06:35] sure that this generation
[1:06:39] charged with bringing back the king
[1:06:43] would know without question what it must
[1:06:49] be like what the work must be to do and
[1:06:53] what the minister must be so we would
[1:06:58] not even know what our mission is to
[1:07:04] perform what our witness is how we are
[1:07:10] to perform and execute it what we are to
[1:07:14] do and how we are to up once more to be

[1:07:38] Branham didn't have any fear to say
[1:07:42] Minister I didn't hear a voice I didn't
[1:07:47] know that it had been said of him and I
[1:07:52] didn't know that the voice from heaven
[1:07:55] had spoken these words I knew nothing of
[1:08:00] that I had not been with any of the
[1:08:04] ministers that believed in him for most
[1:08:08] of those that I was with did not believe
[1:08:12] in him but like a voice and yet not like
[1:08:19] a voice I heard it I knew it
[1:08:22] it came to me have done the Baptist was
[1:08:27] sent as the forerunner of his first
[1:08:33] coming William Branham is sent as a
[1:08:38] forerunner of his second coming
[1:08:43] I know that I was on inexperienced young
[1:08:48] preacher like myself I like to put
[1:08:52] myself
[1:08:53] I was not a corrosion like myself I did
[1:08:58] not know the scripture why I knew this I
[1:09:03] do not know but I knew it I said thank
[1:09:08] God he cross my path thank God
[1:09:15] I learned thank God I caught on it did
[1:09:22] not take ten nights only one night
[1:09:31] hallelujah

[1:09:36] sign and another one and still another
[1:09:41] one one is enough for the bride if
[1:09:51] you're not the bride you're waiting for
[1:09:53] a hundred but if you're the bride one
[1:10:01] time Oh hallelujah is that I caught on

[1:10:23] is that right this generation must be
[1:10:27] without excuse for unto this generation
[1:10:33] he's committed the task to do this so he
[1:10:38] sent forth a particle particle human is
[1:10:45] that rightly that this generation must
[1:10:49] be without excuse alike that he sent
[1:10:53] forth particle human better surrounded
[1:10:57] by supernatural science
[1:11:01] to attract attention and to make this
[1:11:06] way war generation Luka ponder search
[1:11:13] and think thus the halo of light that
[1:11:20] appeared at his birth the star the angel

[1:11:31] were given for that purpose hallelujah I
[1:11:38] didn't hide it to show us God again keep
[1:11:46] that in your heart to show for God again
[1:11:50] to repeat what he showed us in Jesus
[1:11:55] Christ when he came in the form of flesh
[1:12:00] and to remind us one final time like
[1:12:06] Jesus brother Branham read Eman straited
[1:12:10] the very thing which made men believe
[1:12:13] that the true Messiah has come he was a
[1:12:21] seer he saw he lived in both worlds
[1:12:27] the seen and the unseen at the same time
[1:12:33] translate both of them practically all
[1:12:36] the time jesus said My father worketh
[1:12:40] here too and I work the son can do
[1:12:44] nothing of himself but what he seeth the
[1:12:49] father
[1:12:51] here comes brother Branham along in the
[1:12:54] 20th century wonder which one you're
[1:12:57] living in and does exactly the same way
[1:13:02] God in the flesh again crossing our path
[1:13:09] exactly the same way think of that many
[1:13:13] did
[1:13:13] not no they would not have known him if
[1:13:18] they would have been here when God
[1:13:22] crossed their path in their body they
[1:13:25] called Jesus Christ get this now people
[1:13:30] have not changed those who questioned
[1:13:34] then get it the son can do nothing of
[1:13:41] himself but what he sees the father
[1:13:43] doing for watching so every do it these
[1:13:48] also does the son likewise for the
[1:13:52] father loveth the son and show him all
[1:13:57] thing I want to say amen to that
[1:14:06] and I want to say church as he said he
[1:14:11] was inexperienced amen
[1:14:15] but God knows how to get you is that
[1:14:22] right and in this revelation as he
[1:14:26] speaks right we believe that we are
[1:14:32] living in the end time we believe that
[1:14:37] we are not living at the beginning of
[1:14:41] the book neither the middle of the book
[1:14:46] God allows his word to every age and
[1:14:53] then he comes down on the theme in each
[1:14:58] age and interpret his world and brings
[1:15:03] it to pass if the world is supposed to
[1:15:09] be updated he called in the right time
[1:15:15] whether you want to believe because if
[1:15:18] you are not a believer you can't believe
[1:15:23] don't care what and how long your father
[1:15:27] is you just follow it long enough until

[1:16:08] to return I'm not too shocked if I hear
[1:16:14] certain certainty believe the message

[1:18:32] are they always hear church when we must
[1:18:38] know who we are

[1:34:04] his word to every age and then he comes
[1:34:10] on the scene in each age and interpret
[1:34:17] his word and bring it to pass we are now

[1:34:26] world history we are living in the back
