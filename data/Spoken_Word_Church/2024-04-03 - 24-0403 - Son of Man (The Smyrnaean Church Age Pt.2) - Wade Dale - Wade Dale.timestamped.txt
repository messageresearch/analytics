[19:17] him to you yeah we we got a living God
[19:21] we got a God that can do what he said he
[19:23] was going to do we just got to trust him
[19:26] all right put it in his hands Brother
[19:28] John
[19:29] let him he's perfect I don't know if
[19:31] y'all know that or not God's perfect
[19:34] whatever he does it's always
[19:37] right and we'll get into something just
[19:39] a little bit um that really struck me
[19:42] yesterday as I was thinking about it and
[19:45] you know God doesn't make a mistake
[19:47] right right every move he makes is
[19:50] calculated already seen it so he he
[19:53] weaves everything to his to his plan and
[19:56] purpose right every one of these Church
[20:00] A's
[20:01] Messengers were we talk about brother
[20:03] brandham you know being a prophet we
[20:05] know he was a major prophet and and Paul
[20:07] was a major prophet and the ones in
[20:10] between were reformers but brother Adam
[20:12] calls them all prophets he calls them
[20:14] all prophets so they'd be prophets but
[20:16] God that's God we didn't just have the
[20:19] voice of God in this
[20:20] age they had the voice of God in Paul's
[20:23] age cuz it was God telling a group one
[20:25] group of people that little circle up
[20:28] there that group of people in Ephesus
[20:31] and they're the only ones to catch that
[20:32] dream or that Vision or whatever
[20:34] whatever it is that that Paul was
[20:35] preaching they were the only ones that
[20:37] caught it you and I are the only ones
[20:39] that's going to catch the truth of this
[20:41] message only ones and and that's not
[20:44] something I'm trying to exclude God did
[20:47] that God excluded the
[20:50] trash and brought the Bride As I was
[20:53] telling y'all the other day you know God
[20:55] does speak to other people but you know
[20:56] I can speak to um the sister Alicia or
[20:59] or to U Anna my sister or speak to
[21:02] Sister Julie or somebody and I can speak
[21:04] to a sister but I'm not going to speak
[21:07] to them like I speak to my
[21:09] wife God speaks to his wife different
[21:12] than he does to other
[21:13] people amen he whispers secrets to us
[21:17] that's what I was getting yesterday oh
[21:20] man he whispers his secrets to us just
[21:23] us you know why because you and I will
[21:27] listen
[21:29] God called a lot of people many are
[21:31] called but few are chosen you and I are
[21:34] the chosen group of people to see this
[21:37] thing to the end so God bless you we
[21:39] love you with the love of the Lord thank
[21:40] you this past weekend we had a wonderful
[21:42] time with the with the brothers there
[21:44] with brother Tim and brother Solomon um

[23:02] washing uh plus we're going to have the
[23:04] baptismal service so would and we can't

[23:48] brother Aaron the other night because
[23:49] that's what sparked some to get baptized

[28:24] anybody see that should be able to all
[28:26] right Revelations 1:10 say I was in the
[28:28] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[28:30] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[28:34] how many of you have heard the
[28:35] voice you heard the voice in your day
[28:39] all right you heard and that was what it
[28:41] was the voice of God it was the voice of
[28:43] the son of man speaking and John turns
[28:46] and
[28:47] sees saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[28:50] first and the last what thou seest right
[28:51] in the book sent it to the seven
[28:52] churches Asia Ephesus Smurda pergamus
[28:55] thti Sardis Philadelphia Lea he saw the
[28:58] son of man standing in the candlesticks
[29:02] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[29:03] with me being turned I saw seven golden
[29:05] candlesticks and in the midst of those
[29:07] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[29:09] of man clothed down to the foot down
[29:13] garment down to the foot and GED about
[29:14] the PS with a golden girdle I'm getting
[29:17] ahead of myself cuz I like I appreciate
[29:19] what the brother said about the star i'
[29:21] never thought of it that way that star
[29:23] in Bethlehem it didn't show the star the
[29:26] star showed them where Jesus was so
[29:28] that's what the stars that seven stars
[29:30] that that that that brother bradam saw
[29:33] those seven stars as seven men the Bible
[29:34] says it was seven men so there were
[29:36] seven men destined for each age and that
[29:39] was a mouthpiece of God and they didn't
[29:41] show their self they showed Christ they
[29:43] LED them to Christ and they and brother
[29:45] R he led us to Christ all right he had
[29:49] in his right hand Seven Stars and out of
[29:51] his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword
[29:52] you can be
[29:53] seated Lord add his Blessing now today
[29:56] we're going to get to Revelations 2:8 to
[29:58] the
[30:00] angel of the church in smrna right these
[30:02] things sayith the first and the last now
[30:05] watch this we want to get into this in a
[30:06] minute which was dead and is alive you
[30:08] think that's strange it is strange you
[30:12] and I started alive and then we died
[30:14] whoever this person is they died and
[30:16] then now they're
[30:18] alive ah I Know Thy works and
[30:20] tribulation now watch he didn't say I'm
[30:23] going to get you out of your
[30:26] tribulation he didn't say I'm going to
[30:28] get you out of your
[30:30] poverty he said I know what you got to
[30:33] go through I know that you're going to
[30:34] go through problems I know that you Lula
[30:37] church is going to go through
[30:39] problems God knows that but remember for
[30:42] our character building even Christ had
[30:44] to go through things that he suffered to
[30:47] be made perfect and so were you and I I
[30:50] you know what I don't hate it I I
[30:52] thought the other day I said man I just
[30:53] hate that we have to be all beat down
[30:55] but listen you and I have to be led by a
[30:59] chief Shepherd not
[31:01] me Lord Jesus Christ all right and to be
[31:05] led by Lord Jesus Christ he said if
[31:08] you're not chastened you're a bastard
[31:11] child in other words so you're not one
[31:12] of
[31:14] mine so now we but what does that do
[31:16] that doesn't keep God in line right it
[31:19] keeps up Us in line keeps us going in
[31:22] the right path all right and we're just
[31:25] that way we're we're we're hard-headed
[31:27] sheep
[31:28] well pray for me sorry about if y'all
[31:30] are not I am pray for me June raised her
[31:33] hand why'd you do that
[31:35] for and I and I know the blasphemy of
[31:38] them which say they are Jews and are not

[31:42] later next service but are now look he

[32:24] death you and I die here right all right
[32:28] the second death is going to White
[32:29] Throne judgment that's all
[32:32] right so now let's remember as in
[32:34] alwayss I want to keep telling you this
[32:38] because I want you to see the pattern
[32:40] and know that and you say this is kind
[32:42] of silly I want you to know that brother
[32:43] Brandon was the seventh angel messenger
[32:46] I want you to know
[32:48] that by what by the
[32:51] characteristics uh we've had some you
[32:53] know had some people uh debate and and
[32:56] not only uh just recently but it's
[32:58] always been they said well now if
[33:00] brother ran was a prophet show him to me
[33:02] in the
[33:06] Bible
[33:08] right we see him all over the
[33:11] Bible as a messenger as Luke 1730 as
[33:14] Malachi 4 all the different ones and we
[33:17] see that and it's revelations 10:7 in
[33:19] the days of the voice of the seventh
[33:21] angel when he shall begin to sound but
[33:22] some people want to know exactly I want
[33:25] to see a
[33:26] name well your name's not in that book
[33:29] either
[33:31] verbatim but you in Christ you're in
[33:35] every
[33:36] verse that all right so I want you to
[33:39] see that God sent us a prophet I want
[33:42] you to see that God sent us a star to
[33:44] point us to Christ everything we do
[33:47] everything we when we get up into The
[33:49] Spar of of of of U statue of perfect man
[33:53] maybe not so much but the seals and and
[33:56] revealing of the son of man
[33:58] remember it's Christ that died for us
[34:01] without him we don't have a
[34:04] revelation we thrive on
[34:06] Revelation and that's what I said about
[34:08] the bride the bride loves Revelation and
[34:11] she receives Revelation because it's a
[34:14] secret to the
[34:15] world have you not tried to
[34:19] explain the
[34:23] godhead and that's another one you know
[34:24] they want to find brother Brown name in
[34:26] the Bible find the word Trinity in the
[34:29] Bible it ain't
[34:31] there if you want to find verbatim words
[34:34] but I go back to this one quote where
[34:36] Jesus stood one day and he said I thank
[34:38] you Father I thank you
[34:41] Father that you have hid this from the
[34:45] wise and prudent but revealed it to
[34:47] babes such as would learn in other words
[34:50] if we start
[34:52] right we'll end right if we start as
[34:56] babes realize we're Bab
[34:58] realize sometimes that we did things
[35:00] wrong and that we need
[35:03] Grace But realize that and don't say
[35:05] well bless God I got Grace and now I
[35:07] just get greasy all over again no that's
[35:10] greasy
[35:12] Grace no but listen God gave Grace
[35:14] because he knew we' sin that's right
[35:17] we'll get into that later on up into the
[35:19] church ages he knew that he knew every
[35:21] one of us were going to S every Church
[35:24] agent was going to have a messenger that
[35:25] was going to pour his heart out and then
[35:27] that message was going to be turned down
[35:29] and it was going to be refuted so much
[35:32] to where God had to send another
[35:34] Messenger to pick that message up bring
[35:36] a new one not a new one you understand
[35:38] what I mean but bring another one for
[35:41] that group of people cuz we believe
[35:44] God's a dispensationalist right
[35:47] amen and you know what we can understand
[35:49] him by being
[35:51] dispensationalist we can understand how
[35:53] God works by being dispensationalist
[35:56] amen
[35:58] so there's an announcement in heaven
[36:00] I'll get through with this C drop in a
[36:02] minute out of the mind of God comes to
[36:06] logos and I want you to understand
[36:08] something we'll look at in just a
[36:10] minute irenius I've been reading really
[36:14] deep into into many different
[36:16] commentaries of of
[36:18] irenius man he was he was a
[36:21] powerful
[36:23] powerful um and and we can say
[36:25] Theologian if if I may but he was the
[36:27] Holy Ghost fil Theologian he was a
[36:29] church age messenger so God give him he
[36:33] even we'll read it here in just a little
[36:35] bit through the history there was a
[36:37] disputation that there was more than
[36:39] four
[36:40] gospels because you got the book of
[36:42] mccabes you got another book over here
[36:44] you got the book of this one the book of
[36:45] that
[36:46] one irenius thank God irenius is the one
[36:50] that sat down and said no this is
[36:52] Matthew no this is Mark no this is Luke
[36:55] no this is John there's your four
[36:58] gospels so that's kind of how God weaved
[37:01] him into and he also had a very good um
[37:06] interpretation of what the Lost was and
[37:08] we'll get into it in just a minute
[37:10] because remember brother Brown didn't
[37:11] bring the word logos logos has been from
[37:13] a long time theologi called that it was
[37:16] the logos back before the foundation of
[37:17] the world way before brother rman got
[37:19] here all right so there was an
[37:22] announcement in heaven out of the mind
[37:24] of God comes to logos a sealed up
[37:26] message is open
[37:28] something that maybe has never been
[37:29] heard
[37:31] before ain't that
[37:34] familiar ain't that
[37:38] familiar has somebody been witnessing to
[37:40] you and you say all right now where'd
[37:41] you get that
[37:42] at where'd you get that I've read my
[37:45] Bible all this time and where'd you get
[37:48] that at oh let me tell you about
[37:51] this prophet in the end
[37:54] time I'm not ashamed of the having a
[37:56] prophet in the end
[37:58] I'm not ashamed of this gospel that he
[38:00] brought I'm not ashamed to call his name
[38:03] that's right that he helped me to get to
[38:05] Christ he was the Star Messenger that
[38:09] clarified listen not only who Christ is
[38:12] but where he's
[38:14] at he's in his bride he's not out there
[38:16] somewhere he's in his bride he's working
[38:19] in his
[38:20] people and brother bram's whole message
[38:22] he comes down he he comes where brother
[38:24] Tim read it she is
[38:26] him I now call you bride you see him
[38:29] honing all that all that away that maybe
[38:31] even Martin Luther couldn't say
[38:35] that he said the just shall live by
[38:39] faith and he preached a powerful message
[38:41] to get them out of Catholicism from
[38:43] crawling in on on sticks and stones and
[38:46] rocks he said hey the just shall live by
[38:49] faith so there's a mystery unfolded same
[38:51] with Luther and same with Wesley to the
[38:54] star of the age or the messenger picks
[38:56] up the logos of God
[38:58] we were talking about matching pieces
[39:00] really
[39:01] realize what God's done for all of us
[39:04] every Church age God has sent a person
[39:08] with a
[39:10] message separated him from everybody
[39:13] else polycarp was wonderful and he was
[39:16] great to be with probably was a a a good
[39:20] um teacher and
[39:22] probably was a good spokesperson because
[39:26] everybody loved him if you read about P
[39:27] the carp I mean he was he was well known
[39:30] and then of course his death is well
[39:31] known
[39:32] also but he wasn't picked as a church a
[39:35] me putting everything
[39:37] together under a different head so
[39:40] there's a trumpet sounds a messages
[39:42] proclaimed in other words our trumpet as
[39:45] we'll get to in in leosa our trumpet
[39:48] sounded sin in
[39:50] 1947 there was a message
[39:52] proclaimed brother R stood and he said
[39:55] hey we've got these new gadgets that
[39:57] were
[39:59] using recording on wires and recording
[40:02] on on great big 45 and and 78 records
[40:06] you know at first then they went with
[40:08] the tape
[40:10] player but that message was proclaimed a
[40:13] church age begins a distinct and
[40:15] declared message I want you to
[40:17] understand something brother random
[40:19] comes remember in the lap over so
[40:22] irenius has got to come in the lap over
[40:24] read it in just a minute but brother
[40:26] Brown comes in the laugh laap over from
[40:28] Methodist or the Wesley age into
[40:31] Pentecost from Pentecost into the
[40:33] message of the hour and it took him from
[40:35] 47 to 63 to try to turn us back to that
[40:39] faith that was in the that was in the
[40:40] first church age that's how far we got
[40:43] away we got away from everything they
[40:45] stood for in the first church age
[40:46] because there was no denomination on
[40:48] every corter there was no water baptism
[40:50] name father son Holy Ghost there was no
[40:52] eternal hell there was no trinitarian
[40:54] Doctrine in that first church Age first
[40:57] second and third it got eroded toward
[40:59] the third age but that first age was
[41:02] pure it had the lion anointing l i o n
[41:08] bold so it starts a spiritual
[41:11] war think of brother brand him in 47
[41:14] everybody loved him because he was just
[41:16] like the fishes and Loaves he you know
[41:18] he he he he packed houses out with with
[41:21] people sincere cuz they were
[41:23] sick and I thank God that he came along
[41:26] when he did because remember there was
[41:27] no cure for a lot of things that stood
[41:29] before him and a lot of people got
[41:31] delivered for leukemia cancer and all
[41:34] the different things that was going on
[41:35] during that time that that modern
[41:37] medicine had not touched
[41:39] yet and if they had just listened to him
[41:42] they'd have understood a lot of the
[41:43] other that was going on all right
[41:45] talking about it being a bruised cell
[41:47] and about how this was a spirit and it
[41:48] worked like this and man he was a
[41:51] master at telling you what was going on
[41:54] in your body but it starts a spiritual
[41:56] war the true word of God versus false
[41:59] Doctrine there's only truth and
[42:02] false not an in between all right so the
[42:05] messenger then brings his message he's
[42:08] laid
[42:09] away listen you can say what you want to
[42:12] remember God don't make a mistake if
[42:15] brother Ram was the Star Messenger for
[42:17] this age and none
[42:20] other he took him home in December of
[42:25] 1965 God did
[42:28] did I don't get no amen that was God
[42:32] doing that God took him home he was done
[42:34] he was finished there was nothing else
[42:35] for him to say God took him
[42:38] home he was laid away just as Paul got
[42:41] his head chopped off all the different
[42:42] Messengers listen this Holy Ghost
[42:46] Gospel you remember the song it's
[42:48] dripping with blood the blood of
[42:52] Martyrs and you and I are A persecuted
[42:55] group of people you just don't know it
[42:57] yet but when that squeeze comes they're
[42:59] going to turn against you your best
[43:01] friends that you've had for a long time
[43:03] maybe they're going to have to make a
[43:05] choice one
[43:09] day so are
[43:11] you so are
[43:13] you
[43:15] friends or the word of
[43:17] God world or the word of
[43:22] God that's why it could almost deceive
[43:25] the very elect if it were possible but
[43:28] it's not possible to deceive
[43:31] someone that way listen that way that
[43:34] has the Holy Ghost In other words that's
[43:37] to turn the word down because the Holy
[43:38] Ghost can't turn itself down the Holy
[43:40] Ghost has got to coincide with itself
[43:42] now you can be mixed up and confused and
[43:44] all backslid and all that other stuff
[43:46] but some people when they say I'm
[43:47] backslid you got to have something to
[43:49] slide back
[43:52] from hello somebody you look at them and
[43:55] say you ain't been on the mountain yet
[44:01] on cuz listen everybody we all go
[44:05] through the problems but it's how we
[44:07] rebound from
[44:09] it oh I'll just quit going to church cuz
[44:12] I don't feel well God didn't tell you
[44:15] that who told you that the devil so you
[44:18] going to do what he
[44:20] said all right so look people accept it
[44:22] or reject it it brings a temporary
[44:24] judgment what it brought to the
[44:26] Pentecostals they went right on they
[44:28] kept making denominations they just kept
[44:31] M filling the world fall of
[44:32] denominational churches after brother
[44:34] Brandon was taking off the scene but
[44:36] they're dead the prophet of God said
[44:38] they're dead they're like
[44:40] ljes moose LOD and all that other
[44:42] different stuff just got a membership so
[44:45] spiritual death but they think they're
[44:47] alive remember that girl he found in the
[44:50] motel you know she was half neaked and
[44:52] drunk she'd been on some kind of uh some
[44:55] kind of retreat and she comes down
[44:56] through the hallway and she said who be
[44:58] this is life and brother rown said she
[45:00] did not know that that was
[45:03] death what she thought was life was
[45:06] killing her same way with me and
[45:10] you what is life life is coming to
[45:13] church on Friday night and getting a
[45:15] good
[45:16] sermon
[45:18] amen so spiritual death to the ones who
[45:20] reject their
[45:22] messenger cuz
[45:24] remember who was it Samuel or of them
[45:27] yeah when Israel was looking for a for a
[45:29] King Samuel says have I not done all
[45:32] this for you guys have I not done this
[45:34] even brother Ram says have I not done
[45:36] this have I not done that I'm not asked
[45:37] for a dime I I I've prophesied and it's
[45:40] come to pass I took care of you I prayed
[45:43] for you yeah but we want a king and then
[45:46] remember Samuel goes and say God they
[45:48] turned me down what' God tell him no
[45:51] Samuel they didn't turn you down they
[45:53] turned me
[45:54] down so if you turn down the truth
[45:57] you're not turning the man that's
[45:58] bringing it down I don't care how he
[46:00] brings
[46:03] it if it's the truth you're turning God
[46:06] down that's right you're not turning the
[46:07] man down all right so now the next days
[46:10] there's an announcement in heaven it all
[46:12] starts over again but you and I the only
[46:14] announcement we get is we're going in a
[46:19] rapture we are the Omega bride we are
[46:22] the end of it all we get all the curses
[46:26] but we get all the blessings we get all
[46:29] the
[46:30] overcoming that's we have had a sealed
[46:33] up message that is opened by a prophet
[46:35] but we didn't just seal it back up and
[46:37] throw it in a
[46:39] closet God knew they'd be people they
[46:42] knew they'd be Messengers brother Tim
[46:45] cross brother Solomon young guy brother
[46:47] Bob brother Lise brother Aaron amen they
[46:50] could carry this thing further just keep
[46:52] going keep going with it listen if God
[46:55] started it he's going to finish
[47:01] you can say well I'll just stop
[47:03] that yeah try to stop
[47:07] god listen doesn't ever work I just want
[47:11] to give you a secret there it don't ever
[47:12] work try to stop
[47:14] god let's just get in as as the brother
[47:16] said let's just get in and
[47:18] help don't tackle the guy with a ball on
[47:21] your own
[47:22] team protect him protect us all we got
[47:26] all we all got
[47:28] problems but in the age of Pentecost
[47:31] 8030 there was a messenger that was the
[47:32] Holy Ghost and the reason I'm coming
[47:35] back to this you're going to see that
[47:36] really plain when we get over coming out
[47:38] of uh Wesley's message into Pentecost
[47:42] into brother rand's message there had to
[47:43] be an age of Pentecost to get a prophet
[47:48] in the end time end of the age to bring
[47:53] his
[47:54] message all right so we'll get to that
[47:57] so the alpha age was the Ephesian Church
[47:59] age Paul founded the church in Ephesus
[48:01] midcentury so the date of the Ephesian
[48:04] Church age started in ad
[48:06] 53 and went on to
[48:09] 170 Paul died around 64 to 67 so right
[48:13] in the middle of it he passed away the
[48:15] messenger went off the scene does that
[48:17] sound
[48:19] familiar so it just died went on and I
[48:21] mean it just fell apart and there was
[48:23] nothing else going on and well they just
[48:25] went back to the Pharisees and the
[48:27] Sadducees and they said oh we're so
[48:28] sorry we no they didn't they became more
[48:31] bold they became so bold they gave their
[48:34] life as Paul gave his life they gave
[48:37] their life for what they beli and listen
[48:39] they didn't have an internet so he can
[48:40] look up
[48:43] everything praise
[48:45] God Google brother brandham
[48:51] sometime no
[48:55] don't if you got any doubt brother R was
[48:57] a prophet of the end
[49:01] time there's a space right here for
[49:04] you it's called an altar to get your
[49:07] heart
[49:08] right he's
[49:11] gone I I like when Joshua remember when
[49:14] Joshua got his
[49:16] commission and God tells him say now
[49:18] look Moses thy servant is dead I don't
[49:21] think and I've got to go back and look
[49:22] but I don't think I ever in the whole
[49:24] book of Joshua he ever said now Moses
[49:27] said he never said that he had a
[49:30] commission to do what he was going to do
[49:33] and he went forward and done it quit
[49:34] looking back he went forward he knew
[49:37] though that he was built on Moses
[49:40] message but Moses
[49:42] wasn't Moses wasn't coming
[49:47] back God's pattern is when he takes a
[49:50] messenger he does not raise him back
[49:53] up so you can you can argue with God
[49:57] that's
[49:58] right we better get right what's
[50:01] now and we'll we'll worry about this
[50:04] Elijah coming back out of the
[50:07] Grave when this message is fulfilled and
[50:11] a group of people called a bride not one
[50:13] person anymore all right so now we look
[50:16] at this and we see that we've kind of um
[50:19] I'm I'm sorry and apologize uh but I
[50:22] think Dad did this first and then
[50:24] brother Joe and the different ones put
[50:25] those red in there when he preach we
[50:27] preached on the porter he did too where
[50:29] you can see that there was a Pentecostal
[50:31] age over here we just saw that the Holy
[50:33] Ghost fell
[50:35] ad30 Peter was a spokesperson not the
[50:38] messenger to an age there was not one
[50:41] because the Ephesian age Paul was the
[50:44] porter now remember when we read this
[50:47] remember a porter is a doorkeeper not
[50:50] the
[50:52] door so if you keep that separate then
[50:55] you'll know brother Rand wasn't God in
[50:57] the term that people think he's God he W
[51:00] brother BR wasn't the
[51:03] door Christ is the
[51:06] door brother Ram showed us how to get in
[51:09] the door but brother Ram didn't shove
[51:10] you through the door
[51:12] either he gave you a choice he said
[51:15] right here's the door this is the way
[51:18] through water baptism and receiving the
[51:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost and repent and
[51:22] and become Justified and Sanctified
[51:23] filled with the Holy Ghost that's what a
[51:25] porter does tells you what
[51:28] in the
[51:29] door and tells you all about that what's
[51:31] behind that door so that's what we're
[51:33] looking here we see all over in the very
[51:35] we see Paul so Paul comes at the end of
[51:39] the Pentecostal age brings his message
[51:41] see the ARA going up with Paul so now
[51:44] we're going to go through that just for
[51:45] a few minutes look at all that light
[51:46] that was that was just um and I don't
[51:50] understand
[51:51] uh how in the world they got all that to
[51:54] everybody because they didn't have
[51:55] social media they didn't have phones
[51:57] they didn't have this that we're looking
[51:59] at today it was word of mouth and
[52:02] somebody really they were subscribes
[52:04] that would would would not couldn't
[52:06] write a whole sermon because you can't
[52:08] sit there and have somebody say oh now
[52:09] wait a minute hold on what was that you
[52:11] said again listen the Holy
[52:14] Ghost was in these
[52:17] people you want me to prove it to you
[52:19] look at
[52:21] Luke Luke was not with Jesus not one
[52:25] minute
[52:27] and he wrote the whole book of Luke with
[52:29] perfect understanding he said he sat
[52:32] down and God told him what to
[52:35] write brother R sat down God told him
[52:38] what to
[52:39] write he told him one time said pick up
[52:42] your pen and write this
[52:44] down who was that for him no it for us
[52:48] so Paul comes at the end of the
[52:49] Pentecostal age brings his message a
[52:53] powerful message 80% of the New
[52:56] Testament
[52:57] and then what happens at the end he's
[52:59] going to tell us here in a second that
[53:01] Grievious wolves are going to come in
[53:03] we're going to have a santhus and all
[53:04] the different ones that's going to come
[53:05] in and dilute the word of God and then
[53:10] God's going to send an irenius here in
[53:12] just a second at the end of the Ephesus
[53:15] or Ephesian Church age in the lap over
[53:18] or the open door God's going to send ir
[53:20] readus and say
[53:23] hey here's the door I'm going to tell
[53:26] you a little more about it Paul told you
[53:28] about it but I'm going to tell you some
[53:30] more about it so we'll look at it in
[53:32] just a second so everybody got that and
[53:34] that pattern runs all the way because
[53:37] you had to have Elijah brother R came at
[53:39] the end of this
[53:42] age to bring a
[53:44] message wasn't 47 to 63 that was
[53:48] restoration that was trying to get them
[53:49] Pentecostal people out of that
[53:52] overlap everybody with me but when he
[53:56] finally finally in 1963 he said now the
[53:58] message
[54:00] begins then that's the Elijah that
[54:02] brings the message to who you and I that
[54:05] puts us into
[54:07] eternity praise God it's all perfect for
[54:11] some reason God's perfect
[54:15] I that's why I can put my dependency on
[54:17] that there is somebody perfect running
[54:20] the show there is somebody that does not
[54:23] make a mistake running the show but you
[54:26] know what we got to do we got to get to
[54:28] show not show him who you
[54:32] are show who he is through
[54:37] us all right the first trumpet sounded
[54:39] the first seal was tore loose Paul was a
[54:42] messenger what' he do he declared war on
[54:44] Orthodox Church what he was always with
[54:47] the Pharisees he was always in the
[54:48] temple he was always causing trouble
[54:50] then he brings a guy called Barnabas in
[54:52] then he brings Silas and he brings all
[54:54] these guys in and never they just hate
[54:56] them
[54:57] all they hate every one of them throw
[55:00] rocks at them try to kill
[55:02] them took a legion of of of Army and
[55:06] tried to find Paul God warned Paul they
[55:08] let him down from a a roof and down a
[55:11] wall and got him out of there God
[55:14] protects his
[55:18] message so he declared war on the
[55:20] Orthodox Church for not believing the
[55:22] Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to
[55:24] them why they should have have know it
[55:27] they should have know him remember Paul
[55:28] come at the End of the Age Now what's he
[55:30] talking about the end of Ephesus no he's
[55:33] talking about coming at the end of the
[55:34] Pentecostal
[55:37] age ad50 ad30 of her room all right all
[55:43] the messengers come at the end of the
[55:45] age it's at the end time when these
[55:47] things are brought forth John 10 verse1
[55:51] so verely verely I say unto you he that
[55:52] entereth not by the door into the
[55:54] Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[55:57] the same as a thief and a robber see you
[55:59] can't try to get in any other way you
[56:02] can
[56:03] try but remember there was a scenario
[56:06] where somebody got found inside there he
[56:08] didn't come he didn't have the right
[56:09] garment
[56:10] on Jesus said kick him out he didn't
[56:13] come in the right way kick him out
[56:15] weeping wailing nashing of teeth but he
[56:19] that entereth in by the door can we just
[56:21] not do what God said that's
[56:24] right are we do we just be so contrary
[56:28] to what God
[56:30] Said the world is they're
[56:36] contrary did y'all see what happened on
[56:40] I'm sure the media didn't show
[56:44] this but
[56:46] Sunday was declared by our
[56:49] president as National transgender
[56:53] day yes look on the why House website
[56:57] wh.org and it says I Joseph Biden
[57:00] declare this day March the
[57:05] 31st which was Easter
[57:07] Sunday as National transgender awareness
[57:11] day to bring all of us together to
[57:15] understand
[57:17] them you can be a Democrat all you want
[57:21] to it's all
[57:24] filth but that the epitome of
[57:28] felt that is Sodom and Gomorrah all over
[57:31] again at the highest
[57:34] office from the White
[57:36] House and I'm sure somebody will
[57:39] probably try to take this off of
[57:40] YouTube it's okay with me but you didn't
[57:43] hear that on any of the national news
[57:45] because the national news is owned by
[57:46] the Democrats
[57:49] right and the Liberals but that was
[57:52] signed into
[57:54] law I think on like the 26th or
[57:57] something that the or somewhere before
[57:59] that that the 31st was going to be now
[58:02] now it will be
[58:03] national uh and I wouldn't be surprised
[58:06] if that wasn't one of my new holidays
[58:08] for the post office
[58:11] so have all them other
[58:14] ones well let's get off of that to him
[58:17] the porter openeth now Look to Him the
[58:19] porter opening so the porter the door's
[58:23] closed the Porter is the one that open
[58:26] opens the door all right and he calleth
[58:30] his own and the sheep hear his voice and
[58:32] he calleth his own Sheep by name and
[58:35] leadth them out and when he putteth
[58:37] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[58:39] the Sheep follow for they know his voice
[58:41] like I said before the reason the Sheep
[58:43] know they know his voice but they also
[58:46] if they don't don't see him they sure
[58:48] can't smell him amen cuz the shepherd
[58:50] smells like the
[58:53] sheep and a stranger will they not
[58:56] follow but will flee from him for they
[58:59] know not the voice of
[59:03] strangers that's why when we hear
[59:05] strange Doctrine or something maybe a
[59:07] little bit off what is it do I hope I
[59:10] hope there's enough Holy Ghost inside of
[59:12] you to go hey wait a
[59:14] minute you feel that little check hey
[59:17] wait a
[59:18] minute let's look at this again don't
[59:21] jump up and say you false prophet no but
[59:24] you check it out I promise you that
[59:25] whole ho ghost is to lead you and guide
[59:27] you into what all truth amen not some
[59:31] truth all truth because the Holy Ghost
[59:33] does not know
[59:38] error only the devil knows error there
[59:41] is no error in God right it's Error in
[59:46] man so the Greek word
[59:49] for Porter is the one that keeps the
[59:52] door or door keeper or are a watcher God
[59:57] sent us in every age he sent a watcher
[1:00:00] he sent somebody like arenus to say hey
[1:00:03] this is what the truth is now cuz I'm
[1:00:05] going to read you some things about
[1:00:07] irenius that you can see Paul Paul said
[1:00:09] Grievous wolves he died in ad60
[1:00:12] something well then now you got irenius
[1:00:14] he was born in I I I will look at it in
[1:00:17] a minute but his age was 170 to 312
[1:00:20] we're heading toward NAA and what's
[1:00:23] happening already when arenus stands up
[1:00:25] he has to write a
[1:00:27] book called against
[1:00:33] heresy we'll look at in a
[1:00:35] minute he wrote a book on the whole
[1:00:38] thing of of of nosism which is many gods
[1:00:40] and whoever wants to be and all that not
[1:00:42] not one true Living God so the lap over
[1:00:45] brother R says look keep bearing in mind
[1:00:47] that these Church ages start now watch
[1:00:49] whatever is in that one Church age it
[1:00:51] goes all the way through every Church
[1:00:53] age so you're sitting here today going
[1:00:55] well that was just in the Ephesian
[1:00:56] Church age and that was just in the Smur
[1:00:58] Church age and that was just in the no
[1:01:00] it's sitting here today that devil
[1:01:03] hasn't died
[1:01:06] yet so every time you see the salutation
[1:01:09] oh Hallelujah but you better look and
[1:01:11] see where the one he said that hey you
[1:01:14] got a name that you call yourself but
[1:01:16] you're dead amen if you're not bride and
[1:01:19] you call yourself bride that don't
[1:01:21] matter to God you got to come the
[1:01:23] prescribed way to be bride let God call
[1:01:26] you bride right brother brandham look G
[1:01:30] through William brandham called us bride
[1:01:32] now look everybody in that congregation
[1:01:34] was not bride
[1:01:38] right
[1:01:40] sorry brother R said there's three
[1:01:43] kinds all
[1:01:45] right but he did speak to the ones that
[1:01:48] heard
[1:01:49] him the ones that heard him was bride
[1:01:52] they were elect he knew they would
[1:01:54] respond his brother T saying respond to
[1:01:58] it listen the word can be pure and
[1:02:00] unadulterated but if you don't respond
[1:02:02] to
[1:02:07] it you going to be held responsible if
[1:02:09] you don't respond to
[1:02:11] it hello
[1:02:13] somebody God's word won't return void if
[1:02:15] it goes out you can sit there with your
[1:02:17] arms folded all day
[1:02:19] long ain't for me ain't for me ain't for
[1:02:24] me well you better find something it
[1:02:28] is you better find something it is cuz
[1:02:30] it's getting late they we always call it
[1:02:33] redo ain't no redo
[1:02:36] sh that rhymed didn't it there ain't no
[1:02:39] redo we ain't got time for a
[1:02:41] redo we're going forward and this we
[1:02:43] were talking yes um Sunday brother R
[1:02:46] said they'll keep on after the
[1:02:50] bride no more gentille saved he said
[1:02:53] people will still go to church thinking
[1:02:55] they're getting
[1:02:57] saved why because they've been taught
[1:02:59] that oh just s in the message church and
[1:03:01] you're
[1:03:02] fine wait till brother Brown gets back
[1:03:04] cuz we don't know nothing that's
[1:03:08] hogwash you're lazy if you do that
[1:03:11] that's just lazy bunch of people what it
[1:03:13] is I'm just waiting waiting on
[1:03:17] what you get the Holy Ghost you'll be
[1:03:20] moving right so whatever's in that one
[1:03:23] Church age it goes all the way down
[1:03:24] through every Church age and each one of
[1:03:27] the church ages lap over one
[1:03:31] another it's like laps like laying over
[1:03:34] each other like these steps one right on
[1:03:35] top of the other and one Church AG is
[1:03:37] going out the angel or star that comes
[1:03:41] in between there is to call back that
[1:03:43] church to the faith it once lost it's
[1:03:47] always been that way and then I didn't
[1:03:49] see this but the book of Jude is right
[1:03:51] in the Book of Revelation right before
[1:03:52] the Book of Revelations all the other
[1:03:55] writers had died except Jude and John
[1:03:57] and Jude writes and says hey we need to
[1:04:00] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:04:02] once delivered from those people back
[1:04:03] over here and Paul and Paul and James
[1:04:06] and John and all I'm not John but Paul
[1:04:08] and different ones because John was the
[1:04:10] only one standing here on the a of
[1:04:12] patmas and Jude was right behind him so
[1:04:14] the lapping over between the apostles
[1:04:17] and the coming of the Book of
[1:04:18] Revelations because most apostles were
[1:04:20] dead then see it was gone on so what was
[1:04:23] Jude judee's the lap over between the
[1:04:26] writings of Paul and and different ones
[1:04:29] lapped over to get to the Book of
[1:04:32] Revelations there was one living at that
[1:04:34] time that was John the Divine he's the
[1:04:36] one that's writing what we're talking
[1:04:37] about
[1:04:40] tonight so now watch the angel appears
[1:04:42] right at the end time just at the end
[1:04:44] time to rebuke the church for it losing
[1:04:46] its first love and how it got away from
[1:04:48] God like they did down Through the
[1:04:50] Ages same thing the messenger does
[1:04:53] tonight the angel messenger comes back
[1:04:55] to rebuke them each age for what they
[1:04:58] had done so that makes a lap over and
[1:05:00] each one of the church ages just lap
[1:05:02] right over one another like that like
[1:05:04] coming upstairs it's laying in laps like
[1:05:07] that going up does everybody understand
[1:05:08] what I'm talking
[1:05:10] about and and then you know that's what
[1:05:12] I said that during that time it's Grace
[1:05:14] has God giv you
[1:05:16] Grace cuz you're stuck between the
[1:05:19] two some of those old Pentecostals were
[1:05:21] stuck between Pentecost but listen
[1:05:24] Pentecost was true
[1:05:26] hello somebody Pentecost when that Holy
[1:05:28] Ghost fell in 1906 in isusa street that
[1:05:31] wasn't a false holy ghost that was the
[1:05:33] real thing it restored the gifts I they
[1:05:36] may have had a baptism that was false or
[1:05:39] or trinitarian doctrine but God was
[1:05:41] dealing with that right
[1:05:43] then they were
[1:05:46] reformers but God sent a
[1:05:48] prophet to bring it
[1:05:54] back
[1:05:56] brother brandham listen he come to a
[1:05:58] point where I know if I'd have been in
[1:06:00] Pentecost I wouldn't have went and seen
[1:06:01] him
[1:06:04] anymore he rebuked them all the
[1:06:07] time what did he do then he rebuked the
[1:06:09] Pentecostal age just like Paul rebuked
[1:06:12] them getting away from Pentecost ad30
[1:06:15] brother Brown said you've lost your
[1:06:17] first love you you've cabage down on
[1:06:20] this and that and the others speak in
[1:06:22] tongues and it doesn't matter how you
[1:06:23] live just speak in
[1:06:24] tongues right he said you've
[1:06:28] stopped you stopped and God kept
[1:06:32] going what' he do he kept going from the
[1:06:35] lap over into brother brandom tries to
[1:06:38] pick them up and bring them out of
[1:06:39] Pentecost is that not right am I not
[1:06:41] telling you the r he didn't want to
[1:06:42] leave anybody in
[1:06:45] there why did Paul go to the Sanhedrin
[1:06:47] why' Paul go to the Pharisees and sades
[1:06:50] he didn't want to listen he wasn't
[1:06:51] standing there just to say I'm Paul I'm
[1:06:54] Paul I know more than you do he want to
[1:06:56] get them people
[1:06:57] out that's what we all do we want to all
[1:06:59] get out of everything sin that we do all
[1:07:02] the different things we want to pull us
[1:07:03] out of that
[1:07:04] thing that's our
[1:07:07] job that was brother R's job he loved
[1:07:09] those people he said he hated the
[1:07:12] denomination but what loved the
[1:07:15] people hate to sin Love The
[1:07:19] Sinner that's what we're
[1:07:22] doing so Paul come at the end of the age
[1:07:24] and on down lap over of each
[1:07:28] age that's what makes it lap see to the
[1:07:31] angel speaking what it was this laps
[1:07:33] over here to the angel to the end of
[1:07:35] that age brother R what he's doing is
[1:07:37] he's going down through the Book of
[1:07:38] Revelations made the lap stair steps
[1:07:41] going up seven Church agents patma
[1:07:43] Vision now watch here's another you got
[1:07:45] to got to take this one
[1:07:47] too every evil that was in that first
[1:07:50] church lapped over into the next one
[1:07:54] just kept going on down till it finally
[1:07:56] ends up in complete apostasy in this day
[1:08:00] cuz remember there was a little light
[1:08:02] all the way through there and there's
[1:08:04] just a teeny bit in our day and remember
[1:08:08] it was total darkness brother R said I
[1:08:10] put that light in
[1:08:13] there you ought to be running aisles bro
[1:08:15] sis that was me and
[1:08:17] you that was a chance that we
[1:08:21] had to become the light of the
[1:08:23] age he put it there thank God for a
[1:08:26] prophet that stood in the
[1:08:30] Gap if it wasn't for Moses God would
[1:08:32] have killed all of Israel he said Moses
[1:08:35] get out of the way had enough of them
[1:08:39] yeah God gets mad you didn't know
[1:08:41] that God hates did you not know that
[1:08:44] Bible say he
[1:08:45] did God even
[1:08:50] repented he repented for making man
[1:08:53] knowing what they'd do
[1:08:58] he just can't stand sin though he can't
[1:08:59] stand to see it that's why there's a
[1:09:01] blood buffer even from us to him much
[1:09:05] less the world there's a blood buffer
[1:09:06] that he hears our voice saying God
[1:09:09] forgive me God forgive me for what I
[1:09:13] did and he knows whether you mean it or
[1:09:15] not that's right but every evil was in
[1:09:18] that first age lapped over to the next
[1:09:19] one just kept going on down until it
[1:09:21] finally ends up in complete apostasy in
[1:09:24] the last day but I want you to look
[1:09:25] where what happens
[1:09:29] is there's more churches on every corner
[1:09:31] than there's ever
[1:09:33] been and you you just wait something
[1:09:36] happened like 911 something something
[1:09:38] happened they'll all go start going back
[1:09:39] to church oh
[1:09:43] yeah and I I do know why that is but I
[1:09:46] really would it it's striking that it
[1:09:49] stays that way all the
[1:09:52] time it was proven here three years ago
[1:09:59] brother Dale had a stroke Church filled
[1:10:01] up next
[1:10:02] Sunday people crying want to come back
[1:10:05] where they at
[1:10:08] today what
[1:10:10] changed God don't change the Holy Ghost
[1:10:13] don't
[1:10:16] change quit fearing
[1:10:19] change our
[1:10:22] change to what to his perfection amen
[1:10:25] cuz remember we all are
[1:10:28] imperfect but we look to a perfect
[1:10:34] God so you just wait something's going
[1:10:36] to happen I'm probably when that tsunami
[1:10:38] happened in Japan they probably don't
[1:10:39] have no churches over there but if it
[1:10:41] would something happen you wait till
[1:10:42] California sinks on you won't be able to
[1:10:46] get in the church it'll be too late then
[1:10:49] don't try to come to Spoken Word Church
[1:10:52] it'll be too
[1:10:53] late there will be a Time folks when
[1:10:56] it's too
[1:10:57] late I'm not trying to scare you young
[1:10:59] people there is a time when not just
[1:11:01] that physical door is closed God will
[1:11:04] shut the
[1:11:05] door of the Ark and you can't get
[1:11:09] in and praise God we can't get
[1:11:14] out every evil just keeps lapping over
[1:11:17] in each age every little look
[1:11:19] ISM remember
[1:11:24] nism started in the first church
[1:11:26] age a
[1:11:28] saying oh we really don't need to go to
[1:11:32] church we're just going to wait
[1:11:35] till brother brandom gets back
[1:11:39] and I promise you there's a lot of
[1:11:43] people that wish he want that want him
[1:11:46] back they really
[1:11:48] don't cuz he'll start tearing their hide
[1:11:51] and they'll be going no that's really
[1:11:52] not him what' he do to Jesus
[1:11:56] we're looking for messiah we're looking
[1:11:57] for messiah we're looking for messiah
[1:11:58] we're looking for messiah and he came
[1:12:00] down he stood one day and he said what
[1:12:02] part of this Bible have I not
[1:12:05] fulfilled they killed him right said no
[1:12:09] you're not God you're the
[1:12:11] devil they call us that don't they we
[1:12:14] preached a little hard and they say oh
[1:12:15] he had a little Devil in him tonight I
[1:12:17] said
[1:12:22] tonight but there's great there's Grace
[1:12:25] in the lap
[1:12:26] over cuz what God does he sends a
[1:12:29] messenger to pull those people out of
[1:12:31] what they were falling into you see
[1:12:33] where that overlap was it was a thing it
[1:12:35] dipped down they pulled them out of
[1:12:36] there and praise God there was a group
[1:12:39] of
[1:12:39] people that came out of that that's
[1:12:42] right same way in the end time there's a
[1:12:44] group of people that caught the real
[1:12:46] message from Pentecost into the bride
[1:12:48] Age and and and brother Brandon was able
[1:12:52] to get some of them out some of them
[1:12:54] couldn't get out
[1:12:57] all right so look Revelations 2:1 to the
[1:12:58] angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:13:01] write so remember that word is of and
[1:13:04] the word in leosa is of the rest of them
[1:13:07] are
[1:13:08] in excuse
[1:13:10] me the rebuke is if you lost your first
[1:13:13] love Paul was a messenger skip through
[1:13:16] here real
[1:13:17] quick now Paul and Barnabas wax bold we
[1:13:21] might ought try to do that every once in
[1:13:22] a while it doesn't hurt to be bold it
[1:13:25] doesn't hurt to know what you tell
[1:13:26] people what you know and not be boastful
[1:13:28] about it but tell them that how you
[1:13:32] candle got lit right but Paul and
[1:13:35] Barnabas waxed bold and said it was
[1:13:37] necessary that the word of God should
[1:13:38] first spoken to you but seeing you put
[1:13:41] it from you he's talking to the
[1:13:43] Jews all right and judge yourselves
[1:13:46] Unworthy of everlasting life L we turn
[1:13:49] to the Gentiles so that started now that
[1:13:52] didn't start the Gentile age it started
[1:13:56] on the day of Pentecost cuz 3,000
[1:13:58] downstairs got saved and they weren't
[1:14:00] Jews but the but the big core of them
[1:14:03] was Jews up here but 3,000 downstairs
[1:14:05] wasn't all Jews you reading your
[1:14:08] Bible but there was a time when Paul
[1:14:11] listen every time Paul went to the
[1:14:14] Jews they stoned him boed him out right
[1:14:19] so he just quit going to them he said Lo
[1:14:21] we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the
[1:14:24] Lord commanded us saying I have S thee
[1:14:25] to be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[1:14:27] should us be for salvation to the ends
[1:14:29] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[1:14:32] this and when the Gentiles for those of
[1:14:35] y'all that are asleep you're a gentile
[1:14:38] right and when the Gentiles heard this
[1:14:42] they were
[1:14:45] glad thank
[1:14:47] God and glorified the word of the Lord
[1:14:50] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:14:52] life they believed
[1:14:55] Romans
[1:14:57] 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you
[1:14:59] should be ignorant of this mystery lest
[1:15:01] you should be wise in your own conceit
[1:15:03] that blindness in part is happening to
[1:15:05] Israel until the fullness of the
[1:15:07] Gentiles become come in God blinded his
[1:15:10] own
[1:15:12] children just so that you and I could
[1:15:14] get in that's why he has P compassion on
[1:15:17] Israel that's why there is a fifth SE
[1:15:19] Jew that's why there is Jews that are
[1:15:21] going to be given eternal life just
[1:15:22] because of
[1:15:23] Jews just because they're Jews fif Ste
[1:15:27] Jew is just because they're Jew they're
[1:15:28] not
[1:15:30] Christians but they stood for who they
[1:15:32] were and God stood for them but he had
[1:15:36] to Blind them so that you and I could
[1:15:37] come
[1:15:38] in then what's he going to do when the
[1:15:41] Gentiles over age is over he's going to
[1:15:43] lift his hands go to the Jews and
[1:15:45] they're going to go oh my word we missed
[1:15:47] it where did you get those scars in
[1:15:49] other words we missed the whole Messiah
[1:15:51] deal and those two Prophets You know
[1:15:53] what they're going to do they're going
[1:15:54] to say look
[1:15:55] it looks
[1:15:56] bad I'm going to say look Church it
[1:15:58] looks bad sometimes it looks
[1:16:01] bad but those two prophets are Grace to
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:07] 144,000 he they're Grace to him and
[1:16:09] they're going to preach Grace to him hey
[1:16:11] you might have missed
[1:16:15] that but you're getting this and this is
[1:16:19] eternal life that's eternal life you
[1:16:22] missed that you missed being the bride
[1:16:24] but God didn't forget you oh what two
[1:16:26] witnesses I I don't think I'd love to be
[1:16:29] one of them because that's not they're
[1:16:30] not bride but to be standing there and
[1:16:33] watch them proclaim the message and
[1:16:35] their and the Jews their eyes just pop
[1:16:38] open they're like oh and then they like
[1:16:41] I said they they become so uh remorseful
[1:16:44] they're like well we're doomed we messed
[1:16:46] the we messed this whole thing up and
[1:16:48] then for the two prophets to stand in
[1:16:50] the pull pit and say look it was done
[1:16:52] for a purpose amen if you believe in
[1:16:56] this Lord Jesus Christ come to the
[1:16:58] altar we're going to pray for you to
[1:17:01] become a Christian a real Christian oh
[1:17:05] praise God listen God's so
[1:17:07] gracious he have to do that he have to
[1:17:10] do any of this but he did it for
[1:17:16] us Paul said if if any man preach any
[1:17:19] other gospel unto you that that you have
[1:17:21] received than that you have received let
[1:17:24] him be a cursed wow for do I now
[1:17:27] persuade men or God whoa or do I seek to
[1:17:31] please men Paul didn't do that for if I
[1:17:34] yet please men I should not be the
[1:17:37] servant of
[1:17:38] Christ he's also the same one that says
[1:17:41] have I made you my enemy because I've
[1:17:43] told you the
[1:17:45] truth probably one of brother Dale's
[1:17:47] most quoted
[1:17:48] quotes have you become my en enemy
[1:17:51] because I told you the truth but I
[1:17:53] certify you Brethren that the gospel
[1:17:55] which was preached of me is not after
[1:18:00] men listen the gospel brother bradam
[1:18:03] brought us was not of any other man he
[1:18:07] took pieces and parts
[1:18:10] sure but Paul took the Old
[1:18:13] Testament and he brought it alive in the
[1:18:16] New Testament and there was no other
[1:18:18] preacher could tell him any
[1:18:20] different there was no other preacher
[1:18:22] that could sit with him and teach
[1:18:26] Paul Paul went to the back side of
[1:18:28] desert he rolled the Scrolls up went
[1:18:29] back there and said God you call me for
[1:18:35] something this is all I
[1:18:39] got he didn't have one of
[1:18:42] these he was writing
[1:18:45] about that much of
[1:18:48] this but there was this much of it that
[1:18:50] was in Scrolls and he laid it out you
[1:18:53] know what the Holy Ghost said pick up
[1:18:55] your pen and write right pick up your
[1:18:58] pen and write I got something to say to
[1:18:59] my people those Corinthians may be all
[1:19:02] messed up but I want to tell them how to
[1:19:04] get
[1:19:05] unsed those Ephesians they're good
[1:19:07] powerful I want to tell them some real
[1:19:10] meat write this
[1:19:13] down we just happen to get it in tape
[1:19:16] and book
[1:19:19] form don't get quiet this this message
[1:19:22] is it folks I'm telling you you read all
[1:19:23] James doson you read all that stuff if
[1:19:25] you want to this message is
[1:19:27] it if it's not then we're just all
[1:19:30] deceived and we're all going to hell and
[1:19:31] I don't think that's going to happen
[1:19:34] amen but I certify you Brethren that the
[1:19:37] gospel which was preached to me is not
[1:19:38] after men for I neither received it of
[1:19:42] man neither was I taught
[1:19:45] it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:48] now look that was the first church AE
[1:19:49] messenger he said well I can get it just
[1:19:51] like he can get it no you can't you
[1:19:54] ain't Paul
[1:19:56] right Paul was a chosen vessel remember
[1:19:58] what God told anas That's My Chosen
[1:20:02] vessel you go pray for him receive the
[1:20:04] Holy Ghost I got to work for him now
[1:20:06] when God says he got to work for
[1:20:09] you that's why Paul was a prisoner
[1:20:12] that's why Paul either had bad eyesight
[1:20:14] or something was was buffing him every
[1:20:16] day he said God can you take this away
[1:20:19] from us it's really strange that brother
[1:20:21] R had about the same thing only he had a
[1:20:23] stomach issue praying for people that
[1:20:25] was throwing up and he said go back over
[1:20:27] there and eat you some potatoes go back
[1:20:29] over there and eat you some some Mexican
[1:20:31] food and he goes home and throws
[1:20:35] up it's a burden he beared for the
[1:20:38] people but now remember one day he was
[1:20:42] delivered of that that squirrel come out
[1:20:44] and he was
[1:20:47] over you see
[1:20:50] what I can't make it any more plain you
[1:20:52] see what people go through
[1:20:55] to bring you a
[1:20:59] message you look at all these great
[1:21:02] warriors they
[1:21:04] died to bring somebody a message brother
[1:21:07] Brown died to bring us a
[1:21:11] message brother Dale wore his body out
[1:21:14] bringing us a
[1:21:20] message but we got
[1:21:22] it we got the message
[1:21:25] we know I believe we we know where we're
[1:21:27] going we know what we're doing we know
[1:21:29] what God's doing I know that for
[1:21:31] sure but I look at Paul one day
[1:21:35] Paul he looked at a group of
[1:21:37] people he said now behold I know that
[1:21:40] you all among of whom I have gone
[1:21:42] preaching the kingdom of God shall see
[1:21:44] my face no
[1:21:46] more God was revealing something to him
[1:21:48] he wasn't coming back he said wherefore
[1:21:51] I take you to record this day that I am
[1:21:54] pure from the blood of all
[1:21:57] men wow can you stand and say that for I
[1:22:01] have not shown to declare unto you all
[1:22:05] the counsel of
[1:22:07] God take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:22:10] and to all the flock over the which the
[1:22:12] Holy Ghost has made you overseers watch
[1:22:14] how he put Holy Ghost made you overseers
[1:22:17] not you made the Holy
[1:22:19] Ghost Holy Ghost made you
[1:22:22] overseer to feed the Church of God which
[1:22:25] he hath purchased with his own blood for
[1:22:28] I know this that after my departing
[1:22:30] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[1:22:32] listen Paul was a spiritual man
[1:22:34] obviously he could see that demon
[1:22:36] already
[1:22:37] starting he could see that thing all
[1:22:39] that Spirit already creeping into the
[1:22:42] church so he said
[1:22:44] Beware not sparing the flock look also
[1:22:47] of your own
[1:22:49] s he had some judases standing with him
[1:22:53] hello somebody
[1:22:56] he said among you shall men arise
[1:22:59] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:23:01] disciples after them therefore watch and
[1:23:05] remember that by the space of three
[1:23:06] years I cease not to warn everyone night
[1:23:08] and day with tears and now Brethren I
[1:23:11] commend you to God and to the word of
[1:23:13] his grace which is able to build you up
[1:23:16] and give you an inheritance among all
[1:23:19] them which are
[1:23:21] Sanctified you have an inheritance
[1:23:23] tonight
[1:23:28] so remember the city of Ephesus we'll we
[1:23:30] we've already been through all that the
[1:23:31] city of Ephesus really when you start
[1:23:34] reading about it it basically is was the
[1:23:37] book end of what leot is now we thought
[1:23:39] it was we think it's bad here but we
[1:23:41] know it is but morally they were
[1:23:43] horrible over there
[1:23:45] too but that's where God chose for our
[1:23:48] Paul to set up to live for a little bit
[1:23:50] and set up the first powerful church at
[1:23:52] Ephesus in that chaos he's doing it now
[1:23:57] right in this chaos of what I just told
[1:24:00] you that our president did right that
[1:24:02] shouldn't shake you that should point
[1:24:05] you more toward Calvary that should
[1:24:08] point you more
[1:24:09] focused to forget about
[1:24:13] politics it's all
[1:24:22] rotten that's where John lived it's
[1:24:24] where Mary lived Jesus's mom they all
[1:24:28] went to that one place and lived and all
[1:24:30] that around them but yet they held their
[1:24:34] faith and it was cited that John came
[1:24:37] back and wrote The Three Little gospels
[1:24:39] and that Mary was there and they were
[1:24:40] all together in one house I think Julie
[1:24:42] and them were there right didn't you go
[1:24:43] to to Mary's house beautiful place I
[1:24:46] mean from the outside but they were able
[1:24:49] to see that and that's where Mary lived
[1:24:51] and John was there and U of course Paul
[1:24:54] died Rome but some of the other ones
[1:24:56] there and that first powerful Church got
[1:24:58] started
[1:24:59] there so I declare to you that the first
[1:25:02] that the the last powerful church is
[1:25:04] looking in front of me right now this is
[1:25:07] the last powerful church that will ever
[1:25:08] hit the face of the Earth you I don't
[1:25:11] know about
[1:25:14] that not up to you it's you to yield
[1:25:19] yourself yield yourself members yield
[1:25:23] your members to
[1:25:28] God don't do
[1:25:30] more as far as
[1:25:34] works I'm always careful of people that
[1:25:37] that try to work their way into
[1:25:40] heaven had a situation not too long ago
[1:25:43] I mean this boy he work work work work
[1:25:46] work work work work everywhere he went
[1:25:47] work work work work work well come to
[1:25:50] find
[1:25:50] out he was working on some bad
[1:25:55] stuff while he was
[1:26:03] working balanced Christianity is what we
[1:26:05] need to look
[1:26:07] for
[1:26:09] balanced
[1:26:10] Christianity not go over here on one
[1:26:12] side on the Wild Side on this side cuz
[1:26:14] usually if you're doing this you're
[1:26:15] trying to cover up
[1:26:19] something don't come to me and say I'll
[1:26:21] paint your
[1:26:23] house
[1:26:24] well somebody could if they wanted
[1:26:26] to keep me from having to do it I'm just
[1:26:30] kidding but no let's live the Bible says
[1:26:33] live Godly live live live to the
[1:26:36] Lord you know I I'm not the kind of one
[1:26:38] that I I don't want a birthday party
[1:26:40] ever every year I don't want a
[1:26:42] anniversary party I don't want a big old
[1:26:44] Christmas gift I ain't made for that I
[1:26:47] told y'all many many times before
[1:26:50] brother Dale would just rather have all
[1:26:51] y'all Born Again than to have any gift
[1:26:54] that will you ever give him but gift
[1:26:57] cards
[1:26:58] are good good way to start I'm just
[1:27:02] kidding but no I mean we don't we don't
[1:27:06] build kingdoms to our
[1:27:09] sou it ain't all give it to me give it
[1:27:12] to me we're
[1:27:15] servants when brother Bob gets up here
[1:27:17] he's a servant he what he's done is is
[1:27:19] the hour and whatever he's preaching he
[1:27:21] spent maybe two or three hours and then
[1:27:23] all during the week while we were doing
[1:27:25] other things come on somebody well and
[1:27:27] brother Dale while we were doing
[1:27:29] something he was up at 2:00 in the
[1:27:30] morning 3:00 in the morning trying to
[1:27:32] bring you just some content to get to
[1:27:35] you on a church
[1:27:42] service and you see it more I mean I see
[1:27:44] it more
[1:27:45] now that you got to stay in something
[1:27:49] you can't just have hazly do something
[1:27:51] when it comes to the word of God
[1:27:52] especially in the end time
[1:27:55] you got to be so precise because the
[1:27:56] devil's just on one little crack and
[1:27:58] he'll he'll slide right in there so you
[1:28:01] got to keep those cracks cinched up make
[1:28:04] sure like like you know I am like my dad
[1:28:08] in that way Dad tried to tear down
[1:28:13] doctrines and if he got a good one he
[1:28:16] tried to refute
[1:28:19] it instead of just going what that's it
[1:28:22] oh yeah that's see it right there buddy
[1:28:25] yeah that angel walked right through
[1:28:26] that wall and and told me to tell you
[1:28:29] all y'all are are you ain't got to do
[1:28:31] nothing but just believe the message and
[1:28:32] that's it and you're born
[1:28:37] again what if an angel walked through
[1:28:39] and told you the same thing brother Ram
[1:28:42] said that's bait for Pentecost that's a
[1:28:45] feeling I got an angel you got an angel
[1:28:49] all
[1:28:50] right he might not be a white
[1:28:52] one amen right if it's false Doctrine
[1:28:55] it's false Doctrine
[1:28:58] sorry Revelations 2:7 says he that hath
[1:29:00] an near let him hear what the spirit
[1:29:02] sayith to the church is to him that
[1:29:03] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:29:05] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:29:06] the paradise of God Revelations 22:12
[1:29:09] says behold I come quickly and my reward
[1:29:12] is with me to give every man according
[1:29:15] as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[1:29:18] Omega there's the beginning and the end
[1:29:19] the first and the last blessed are they
[1:29:22] that do these Commandments that they may
[1:29:24] have right to the tree of life and may
[1:29:27] enter in through the great through the
[1:29:28] gates into the city now you and I we
[1:29:31] know what the tree of life is it's not a
[1:29:33] literal
[1:29:34] tree they might be some over in the in
[1:29:37] the future home but the tree that was in
[1:29:39] the Garden of Eden was not an apple
[1:29:41] tree it was Jesus Christ and
[1:29:44] devil two trees good and evil tree of
[1:29:49] life that's what we're living by right
[1:29:52] now so look at at that first church
[1:29:55] age they were promised they could eat
[1:29:58] from that tree if you'll just persevere
[1:30:01] if you'll just overcome this is what you
[1:30:03] got looking you you're looking at this
[1:30:05] right in the face but you know what a
[1:30:06] lot of people turned it down so God had
[1:30:08] to send another church age a saman
[1:30:11] church
[1:30:12] age I forgot my R saman Church age
[1:30:16] Revelations 2:8 says to the angel of the
[1:30:18] church in Smyrna right these things
[1:30:20] sayth the first to last which was dead
[1:30:23] and is alive I Know Thy Works in
[1:30:26] Tribulation and poverty but thou are
[1:30:27] rich I know the blasphemy of them which
[1:30:29] say they are Jews and are not but are
[1:30:32] the synagogue of Satan fear none of
[1:30:35] those which Thou shalt suffer behold the
[1:30:37] devil will cast some of you in prison
[1:30:39] that you may be tried how many of us I
[1:30:41] didn't think so and you shall have
[1:30:43] tribulation 10 days be thou faithful
[1:30:46] unto
[1:30:47] death be thou faithful unto death can we
[1:30:51] hold on have we got what it takes to
[1:30:54] hold
[1:30:56] on because it is I'll give thee a crown
[1:31:00] of
[1:31:01] life eternal life he that hath an ear
[1:31:05] let him hear what the spirit saith un
[1:31:07] the churches he that overcometh shall
[1:31:08] not be hurt of the second death now the
[1:31:11] word Smyrna means bitter or that's where
[1:31:14] the word m comes from smna it comes from
[1:31:17] the word myr which was used in inbombing
[1:31:20] the dead so this Mur in church age
[1:31:23] brother R said look the word Smyrna
[1:31:24] means also a bitter being derived from
[1:31:27] the word myrr myrr was used in inbombing
[1:31:29] the dead thus we have a twofold
[1:31:31] significance found in the name of this
[1:31:33] age it was a bitter age filled with
[1:31:36] Death Watch the two Vines within the
[1:31:38] framework of the church were drifting
[1:31:40] further apart with an increased
[1:31:43] bitterness toward the True
[1:31:48] Vine that's why bride don't fight bride
[1:31:50] if you got two people
[1:31:52] fighting okay all right right there's
[1:31:55] bitterness toward the True Vine on the
[1:31:57] part of the false death was not only the
[1:32:00] seed of false Vine but even in the True
[1:32:04] Vine now listen even in the True Vine
[1:32:08] there was a creeping
[1:32:11] paralysis and impotence because they had
[1:32:13] already drifted from the unadulterated
[1:32:16] truth of the first few few years after
[1:32:19] Pentecost now watch and no True Believer
[1:32:23] is in I like to put this in red no True
[1:32:26] Believer this is Brother Brown no True
[1:32:28] Believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:32:31] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[1:32:34] and adherence to the pure word of
[1:32:37] God that's profound only a prophet could
[1:32:41] bring that out of the mind of God to
[1:32:42] tell us that no True
[1:32:45] Believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:32:48] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[1:32:51] and adherence to the pure word of God as
[1:32:54] seen by multitudes of examples in the
[1:32:56] Old Testament organization was growing a
[1:32:59] pace confirming and augmenting the death
[1:33:02] of the membership for Holy Ghost
[1:33:04] leadership was deposed and the Word was
[1:33:07] replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made
[1:33:12] rituals I want you watch this when
[1:33:14] Israel entered into unlawful alliance
[1:33:16] with the world and formed Fellowship by
[1:33:18] marriage the day finally came when the
[1:33:20] world took over and Babylon carried away
[1:33:24] the people of God into captivity look
[1:33:27] now when they the Jews went into
[1:33:29] captivity they went in with a priesthood
[1:33:32] a temple and the
[1:33:35] word but when they came back they had
[1:33:38] rabbis a theological order of Pharisees
[1:33:41] a synagogue and a
[1:33:43] talmood and when Jesus came they were so
[1:33:46] corrupt he called them of their father
[1:33:48] the devil and this in spite of the fact
[1:33:51] they were of Abraham according to the
[1:33:56] flesh could we be
[1:33:58] message according just to the
[1:34:03] flesh I'm gonna preach it anyway that's
[1:34:07] right we're all Abraham's seed by by by
[1:34:11] birth but are we the Royal Seed of
[1:34:15] Abraham now watch in this age we see the
[1:34:18] same thing happening however as all
[1:34:20] Israel is not Israel and not all bride
[1:34:23] is bride
[1:34:25] but a little group were were the true
[1:34:27] spiritual Israelites so there would
[1:34:29] always be a little group of true
[1:34:31] Christians the bride of Christ until he
[1:34:33] came for his own doesn't matter how much
[1:34:35] Satan squeezes it you go there's going
[1:34:36] to be a bride in every age that fulfills
[1:34:39] every part of it and that's what you and
[1:34:41] I are in right now so this age started
[1:34:43] around 170 ad to 312 the messenger was
[1:34:48] irenius brother Bram said using our
[1:34:51] god-given rule of choosing the messenger
[1:34:52] for each age when unhesitantly declar
[1:34:56] that irenius was exalted by the Lord to
[1:34:58] that position he was a disciple that
[1:35:00] great Saint Warrior faith polycart and
[1:35:03] it's no doubt as he sat at the feet of
[1:35:05] that great man he learned the Christian
[1:35:07] Graces that FL flowed from his
[1:35:09] consecrated life for polycarp was one of
[1:35:12] the true illustrious Saints of look of
[1:35:14] all ages pretty nice guy when viewed in
[1:35:18] the light of a blameless life you will
[1:35:22] remember from your own reading that
[1:35:23] olart was martyred too old to flee too
[1:35:26] sincere a man to allow another to hide
[1:35:28] him and then suffer a penalty for doing
[1:35:30] so he gave himself up to death but
[1:35:32] before he did he asked for and was
[1:35:34] granted permission to pray two
[1:35:38] hours can we get five
[1:35:45] minutes but before he did he asked and
[1:35:47] was granted permission to pray two hours
[1:35:49] for his brethren in the Lord for the
[1:35:52] governor and for his
[1:35:55] enemies and his
[1:35:57] captors like the great great Saints of
[1:36:00] all ages and Desiring a better
[1:36:01] Resurrection he stood firm refusing to
[1:36:04] deny the Lord and died with a free
[1:36:06] conscience he was placed at the stake he
[1:36:09] was untied at his own request and the
[1:36:11] fire was lit the fire bent away from his
[1:36:14] body refusing to touch him he was then
[1:36:16] pierced through with a sword as this was
[1:36:19] done water gusted from his side and
[1:36:21] drowned the
[1:36:22] Flames what a saintly
[1:36:24] man what a
[1:36:26] testimony his Spirit was actually seen
[1:36:28] to depart in the form of a white dove
[1:36:30] released from his bosom yet for all this
[1:36:32] great testimony this student of John the
[1:36:35] Revelator was not militant against the
[1:36:38] nickan system for he himself leaned
[1:36:42] toward organization not realizing that
[1:36:45] the desire for fellowship and what
[1:36:48] appeared like a good plan to Foster the
[1:36:50] work of God was really a trick of the
[1:36:53] day
[1:36:54] a trick of the enemy with irenius this
[1:36:57] was not so he was militant against any
[1:36:58] form of organization all also his life
[1:37:01] history where he served the Lord was one
[1:37:03] of much manifestations of the Holy
[1:37:05] Spirit and the Word was taught with
[1:37:07] unusual Clarity we'll see that in just a
[1:37:09] second we'll get to it and then we'll
[1:37:10] close in Conformity to its original
[1:37:13] precepts his churches in France were
[1:37:14] known to have the gifts of the Spirit
[1:37:17] among them for the saint spok in tongues
[1:37:19] prophesied raised the dead healed the
[1:37:20] Sick by the prayer of faith he saw that
[1:37:23] danger of any kind of organized
[1:37:25] Brotherhood among the elders pastors Etc
[1:37:27] he stood solidly for a unified
[1:37:29] Spirit-filled gift manifesting local
[1:37:32] church and God honored him for the power
[1:37:35] of God manifested among the saints he
[1:37:38] was also clear in his understanding of
[1:37:40] the godhead see was since he was a
[1:37:42] disciple of the polycart who in turn was
[1:37:45] a disciple of John you can know he sure
[1:37:47] had a perfect teaching is possible on
[1:37:49] this subject so the messenger was
[1:37:52] irenius he was born in 130 ad and he
[1:37:54] died in
[1:37:55] 202 this is some of the things that some
[1:37:57] of the quotes that he said I want you to
[1:37:59] listen to this the glory of God is Man
[1:38:02] Fully
[1:38:03] Alive not God Fully Alive the glory of
[1:38:07] God is Man Fully
[1:38:10] Alive these are direct quotes from him
[1:38:12] Jesus the Incarnate Word is a meeting
[1:38:15] place between God and
[1:38:18] humanity and he wrote the book against
[1:38:20] heresies we'll look at that just a
[1:38:22] minute are are
[1:38:24] gnosticism he was a disciple of polycarp
[1:38:27] who was a disciple of John the Revelator
[1:38:29] and then it was recorded that he set the
[1:38:31] four gospels as the cannon of scripture
[1:38:34] he took out all the other ones the book
[1:38:35] of the mbes and all that that they were
[1:38:36] trying to force on the people he took
[1:38:38] these four and he said these are the
[1:38:41] gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John so
[1:38:44] they started using them as the
[1:38:46] gospel the central point of irenius is
[1:38:49] theology is the unity and goodness of
[1:38:51] God in opposition to the Gnostic theory
[1:38:54] of God which is a number of divine
[1:38:58] emanations and that's what gnosticism is
[1:39:00] you got many many gods along with a
[1:39:03] distinction between those two people boy
[1:39:06] that's a a read if you want to read it
[1:39:07] about the monad and the D merge irenius
[1:39:11] used the logos theology watch that he
[1:39:15] inherited from Justin
[1:39:17] Martyr the word martyr just didn't mean
[1:39:19] that just a martyr was martyred
[1:39:21] everybody with me I enus was a student
[1:39:24] of polycart who was said to have been
[1:39:26] tutored by John the Apostle now John had
[1:39:29] used logos terminology and the Gospel of
[1:39:31] John in the letter of First John irenius
[1:39:34] often spoke of the Son and the spirit as
[1:39:36] the hands of God though he also spoke of
[1:39:38] the son as the
[1:39:41] logos wow what a revelation irenius
[1:39:46] had and to the angel of the church in
[1:39:48] smna write these things sayith the first
[1:39:50] and the last which was dead and is alive
[1:39:52] and I wrote dead then alive Adam was
[1:39:55] alive then he died so it's not talking
[1:39:58] about him you were alive and then you
[1:40:00] died ain't talking about you who you
[1:40:02] talking about Jesus Christ whoever this
[1:40:05] is took death and turned it into
[1:40:10] life that's the guy we
[1:40:13] serve that's the guy that destroyed
[1:40:16] death as we say last Sunday in the
[1:40:19] resurrection let's
[1:40:22] stand he took death and turned it into
[1:40:28] life Sunday we're going to have a water
[1:40:30] baptism we're going to take death and
[1:40:33] turn it into life am you love the
[1:40:37] Lord I'll read some more of next Sunday
[1:40:39] about irenius but man he had a
[1:40:41] powerful powerful
[1:40:44] Ministry um in that second Church age
[1:40:48] and he didn't have like I said didn't
[1:40:50] have books and tapes if he was a student
[1:40:52] of Poli carp he had to hear what
[1:40:54] polycarp
[1:40:55] said put it in his filter and then speak
[1:41:00] it same way with polycart with John the
[1:41:03] Revelator cuz John the Revelator was
[1:41:04] pretty old when polycart was being
[1:41:07] polycart was he was teaching polycart so
[1:41:10] he had to remember all these things and
[1:41:12] we have a problem remembering scripture
[1:41:13] I can't hardly remember what scripture I
[1:41:15] read first part of the service but I do
[1:41:18] but I got wrote down right here but but
[1:41:21] you see what God did though and I don't
[1:41:23] say this to be frivolous but I mean
[1:41:26] we're just sometimes we're brain dead
[1:41:28] because we don't use our
[1:41:30] brain they had to listen they had to
[1:41:34] listen to every word they couldn't Veer
[1:41:36] off into space or or fall
[1:41:39] asleep if they did Paul prayed for them
[1:41:42] brought them back to life and started
[1:41:44] preaching again but they had to listen
[1:41:46] to what the spirit said they couldn't go
[1:41:49] back and say no no what was in Psalms
[1:41:51] what they didn't have a book of Psalms
[1:41:54] they have the Bible put
[1:41:57] together we got all this information yet
[1:42:01] sometimes we don't know a thing about
[1:42:04] God we got it right here that's why we
[1:42:07] have no excuse that's why in this age
[1:42:09] there when the Great Falling Away
[1:42:11] comes there's not anything to pick us
[1:42:14] back
[1:42:14] up because the great falling away is to
[1:42:17] come is coming from the last Church age
[1:42:20] messenger so if it's coming from that
[1:42:22] that's the last one then it goes to like
[1:42:25] brother R said it goes into complete
[1:42:27] apostasy which is Satan as we'll get to
[1:42:30] in a little while they will not sit in
[1:42:33] the synagogue of Satan they will be the
[1:42:36] very seat of the
[1:42:39] devil the Pope the Antichrist he will be
[1:42:43] the devil
[1:42:45] incarnate just like he incarnated the
[1:42:47] Beast back in the Garden of Eden he'll
[1:42:50] incarnate that man called a pope and you
[1:42:53] better not be
[1:42:55] here run to God flee to the ark don't
[1:42:59] worry about anything else don't worry
[1:43:00] about brother and sister worry about
[1:43:02] getting yourself there worry about
[1:43:05] getting yourself in
[1:43:07] but we all have a chance everybody will
[1:43:11] have a chance to come to God or you've
[1:43:14] already had it one of the other so let's
[1:43:16] sing a song God bless you then we'll be
[1:43:18] dismissed remember the water baptism

[1:44:32] through these Church ages that very name
[1:44:36] got
[1:44:37] lost it got lost in the churches they
[1:44:40] started baptizing in
[1:44:43] titles making him a third person or a
[1:44:45] second person of a
[1:44:46] trinity but praise God we've been
[1:44:49] restored back by true Messenger so
