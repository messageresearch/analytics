TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to see amen and amen and amen to see the Lord you look into his word and then turn around and look back at his people don't you amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we're reading from Matthew 19. and we will continue our thought on marriage and divorce now this question was laid on my office probably six or eight months ago and I've announced it many times we'd be preaching on it so you know just take the thought from the Lord and ask him to speak to you about all of the things because it won't end with just a physical situation you read marriage and divorce but if you will read the invisible Union because if we can't tie together the literal fact of it though then we will not see what is meant totally in the spiritual fact you know of the invisible Union because that was a great message he said it was a greater portion of marriage and divorce so then that way you know we knew it but you know and I like to say to people somebody maybe hear this in Internet or something then you know you wonder well way we have to lay it down sometimes it it looks like there's no hopes for anybody but then just remember uh the best way of saying it there's only one sin unto death and that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost because of marital problems wouldn't be a sin unto death you know so then hold on and God always can give an answer because if there's any question or thought then there has to be an answer to go with it so remember that now remember the Bible study will be Saturday the the first Saturday in May at six o'clock remember the fellowship meeting will be on the third Saturday 3 30. brother Jonathan Jones will be here preaching for us now if there's any of you from out of town you know we've got a sign up sheet down there a dose from out of town now not because Wade and them can come over the house and spend the night not close in you know but from out of town and you need a place to stay on that fellowship meeting Saturday night there's no need of driving back home but there's a sign up sheet down there sign up and somebody will put you in their home you know and and everything and it won't be any problems you won't have to be traveling backwards and forth on on your doing so remember that just you know keep it in your mind right I know you already have but pray for Brother Gary Krantz his father he's in bad shape and also just keep praying for him the Lord would would touch him and and do any other announcements hi Jimmy Mirch okay all right let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for all things and we just ask you this morning to come Among Us and be not an onlooker or a recorder of our lives and our Deeds but to be the preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives that you can reveal yourself unto us because lord it's a it's a day when we need more there's the prophet said we need Revelation more than anything so then we ask you to just come Among Us and speak to us and God each one of us Lord in your love and Lord just bless those that are not with us remember the sick among us and just help each and every one of us to walk in you and to be with brother Gary's dad our Lord he's on up in age so remember him and and just be with him and comfort him have your way with each and every one of us in Jesus name amen all right Matthew 19. that said we'll read this scripture basically in every thought until we get you know to doing because it covers the whole thing all right Matthew 19 and verse 3. foreign also came unto him tempting him now what's tempting him saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause we've got Moses we know what he's taught us you know any calls whatsoever all right does Jesus cover it for any cause no and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he was made them at the beginning made them male and female that's it for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they Twain she'll be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put us under they say unto him so he kind of softened it down a little making you know well we still have some scriptures and things but uh you know what are you saying they saying to him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away if all of that you know we go back to the beginning why did he do it and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committest adultery and whosoever committeth whosoever Matt heard that is put away does commit adultery you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we as I said the other day some people connect on and they don't know and hear uh I try to make this announcements every once in a while about it I'm not picking on anybody uh I'm trying to preach what I believe is the truth and that way then I believe the truth can make us free well do we really need to know this brother Dale well I believe it's necessary and beside it was a question given unto him in as a minister of the Gospel I'm Duty bound to try to answer those questions and a lot of people if you asked a lot of ministers that say I don't know and I ain't gonna get into it well okay that's their business but you know we are responsible amen right or wrong responsible for making a statements and doing things to do that but all right now we've tried to study there this is the fourth message and we've taken the part of the garden and trying to understand you know the things and seeing what happened in the garden and to do just a small amount of review we know that they're in Genesis about 313 Eve said the serpent beguiled me all right now we know that in the doing that beguiled means defiled and now and she lays the point to the serpent beguiled me now um if we were of the organized religion form of life for most people we would just say well the the you know you can R you can get them to discuss the regional sin being unbelief they'll talk with you about that you know they'll talk about what yeah sure it was unbelief uh you know it was disbelieving and then they'll go on to the carnality of of the attribute being an apple to eat or some partaking of some form but yet they would still even go with you on the point of the unbelief and that would be the first case of unbelief in the garden well that's that's that's fine and all but yet we're trying to get down to see what actually took place and as I was trying to cover on the last message then what is the seed of the serpent uh we say it was the the Beast with Eve well that's the seed of the Beast right you know that that brought the Natural Things of over what is the seed of the serpent because it speaks about him and said he was in the garden you know well then the seed of the serpent is what I tried to bring out as to be that he injected his thought or idea into Eve to get her to reason upon what God had promised or said you know would take place all right see then we've got to go to that to the to the Intercourse of the Mind before you can go to the Intercourse of the physical to do anything well that's you know let's hold that point so and you'll see a little later when I get down to a couple of more messages you'll see why we we have to lay on to that more uh you know harder to try to place a point to what I want to say all right because I asked the question about it that we know that polygamy came into being would be dealing with a little bit of that today but why is it that the animal was placed under polygamy what caused that you know you can understand the human race you know and even those who would be arguing that it was just unbelief or eating an apple they would still tell you that polygamy came into being throughout the Old Testament because it can't argue the point because David had you know 700 wives Solomon had a thousand but each one of those was his wife and they could not have another husband they would go with you on those things to be able to come down to type Christ in the church but yet uh you know why is it the animal was placed under the polygamy I'm trying to hit a few points that I've never covered on this when I would just try to go through it I would just start out before basically what is a marriage and we will probably deal with that Wednesday or or next Sunday you know what is a marriage and you know and what's this and who can marry and who can to a little bit this afternoon but see this time I kind of picking the points to make you think not to just preach the message over again because you know we've been through those things three or four times in the 40 years that I've been here and you know doing it probably every five years or something down the road to try to help all of us but uh you know I come up with questions myself and you know one question all we've had was was you know how was Eve created any different than Adam you know what she made of some form that made her so sexually or or desirous and things that was that her doings well if it was then God created her that away and you got a problem if you only deal with that right but if you bring her into being as a perfect being as we've tried to bring you know not an eternal a perfect being standing in the garden then how that she could come with her reasoning factors to the spirit of man memory reason conscious of factions Etc Satan could approach her and through the Intercourse of her mind he could get her polluted see Eve was just as polluted standing there more in really sense of God and Mankind she was more polluted by the Intercourse of the Mind than she was by the physical the physical was just an attribute that's why we say and the prophet will tell you what sin is not ranking gambling smoke and run around with women adulteries and thought he said that's the attribute that's the display of what was causing the problem all right so then she's she's causing that problem by her uh intercourse of the mind she accepts Satan we'll get to that in a second but she said she was defiled beguiled all right now if there was not a physical connection I'm asking this question we'll get back to it in a minute I like to ask questions I love questions and answers I would do that every service if it wasn't maybe that you know you would get hooked up in in one or two with all it would be asking the questions so I like to ask the questions that way I can direct things the way I desire and my question is if there was no physical contact in the basis of these beasts the serpent uh if it was just an apple Etc trying to take those things out of some people's mind my point is why would the serpent wind up and be cursed I mean why would you curse him if if there was no connection to him are you listening to them and just I just I like questions I like to get you to think if there was no connection then why would you curse him we'll get to it in a minute I've got them in here and we'll read it we'll run around and said God didn't curse Adam all right here's another God didn't curse Eve he cursed the ground he cursed the serpent but he never cursed Adam and Eve all right then see why would it be that we would deal with any form if there was not some physical connection between the The Serpent and Eve now we went through it to see that Eve never received her name until the fall her name was woman she was taken from man and then she wants to fall came she became Eve which is what the mother of all living because we know that then there was a lineage seed that came down from the Beast and there was a lineage seed that came down from Adam all right we know that we believe it because even science says there's got to be something between the man and the monkey because they've tried to interrelate that you know bringing it together and trying to produce a child that won't do it but see they can't find that Beast right if they would even just go back and think about it a little amen and surely smart men think of these things but why won't they come out and state those forms of things I would like for you to if you've got a Scofield bible I don't gently go with his footnote some of them are good and some of them are not uh film I like some of them I don't care too much for uh let's see where's it at hang on a minute after serpent yeah if you've got a Scofield bible it'll be on page eight he's referring back to the serpent he says the serpent in his adamic form is not to be thought of as a wreathing or a wiggling you know reptile that is the effect of the curse right Genesis 3 14. the creature which lent himself to Satan May well have been the most beautiful as it was the most subtle of creatures less than man look traces of that beauty remain despite the curse every movement of a serpent is graceful and many species are beautifully colored in the serpent Satan first appeared as an angel of Light now that's just Schofield with his dollars but yet if you'd probably ask him about it and he'd probably still thought he ate he made an apple he just figured out the Beast gave the Apple to him because remember the the it says the serpent was the most subtle of all beasts so he was a beast upright creature first the point between man and the monkey that's why they can't find it the missing link if they've hunted far all right because all of the other there is a link between all things and we do not believe in the natural point of evolution but we we believe in creative evolution in that God created one higher than the other each stage coming up we believe in that that's that's wonderful you know but if you went back there and tried to see and find those and then Darwin would have just been able if he'd read the Bible instead of sitting out there on that island with his mind running um you know he could have done a whole lot of hallucinating out there and got all his thoughts but uh if he just sat down and read the Bible then he just said hey there he is we don't know what happened to him but here's the link but see that would have been something that would have made it not a mystery that's right and it would not you know as we'll read in a minute it would not have required a revelation amen all right but now think of it as I said if there's no physical connection with the natural between Eve and the Beast serpent ever how you want to relate it um why was he cursed what was the purpose you know I mean you you walk out Donnie's got a horse over there and he's over there and he's rubbing that horse and he's you know getting ready to ride her and you know he stands there and she picks up her foot and sets it down on his toe well now some of them meant to do that because I've been around enough animals to know they mean to do that you know I mean they'll they'll get you they'll kick you they'll do everything but we're just saying a natural thing happens when he turns around and he just beats the Daylights out of her and he you know he curses the the horse for stepping on his foot I don't mean physically I'm using that because of the other point of the curse right yeah why it was at the animal's fault or was it his fault even if it was Ivan hive there would be no reason for cursing the animal are you following me there was no reason to curse the serpent or beast either one if you're only going to go with an apple effect because the animal has no he it was no problem of his Satan was using him to do that all right now listen to what I'm saying the natural curse was involved because see Satan had already fallen out of heaven and he was already cursed so you don't have to curse him in the Bible you said we don't find no scripture where Satan is cursed now he started off anyway for what he done in the garden that's why when I was in the series on the the uh coming down to the Bible in Revelations you remember we we emphatically stated two or three times that uh Satan doesn't have to even go to the white throne he's cast into the Lake of Fire he doesn't have to go to the watch room then your Bible proves that because he's not a human being right it's not a soul involved the it's a spirit it's a person I mean a spirit but not a person all right so now father with me what I'm saying he said the serpent beguiled me and but God means to defile right serpent seed paragraph 163 these I'm just quoting they won't have them up all right by the Intercourse of the mind that was covered a while ago that Eve had to be first approached and like he said no woman can have intercourse with a man until she first accepts that in her mind a rape case those things those are not considered to be we will eventually get to that I I don't believe a rape case is any problem I believe the the girl is still a virgin now physically you can't prove that but spiritually I believe it because it's not her fault but when she's involved in it then it's her fault all right so that's paragraph 178 through 186 spoken words Original Seed we covered those Wednesday quoting from the scripture of second Corinthians 11 3 says but I fear lest that by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrected from the Simplicity that is in Christ now I've never preached that scripture the way that I see it because when I see it there I see the the angels of Satan Delights the Ministers of the Gospel that the Bible speaks of as Ministers of righteousness but are Satan's ministers they are corrupting the Simplicity that is in Christ in other words they're not bringing it according to the word and by not bringing it according to the word they're they're corrupting it you know because to me when I look through the Bible now after the years of study I see Christ through every verse right and the prophet said if you don't see him in every verse go back and read it again he said you missed it see but then we turn around and try to make him to peoples try to make him two Lords try to make him all of these things and make him not God until the river Jordans Etc then we're we're corrupting the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus we're doing exactly what happened in the garden I believe today is the day that you and I can be sit back and look at Satan doing exactly what he done in the garden but see what we want to do is look at it like this looking at you the yeah no no no you better go look in the mirror you mean we shaved him this morning you women you fixed is higher this morning you looking in the mirror that's the one you got to worry about because no matter what it is up here if you got God in your heart dire there's no deception can come from here that will take you down might pervert you in harmony for quite a while but won't be able to destroy you okay now just thinking of those things all right then we got in Wednesday night to the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil funny looking tree yeah yeah me funny looking tree then people want to end the message people especially a lot of them I know the quotes from Brother randomly gave much of them Wednesday Eve is a tree right but show me what run around and said Eve is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil she's a tree you're the You're The Offspring of your mother you're you know she's a tree she brought you into being she reproduced the husband to bring you into being but the tree of knowledge would have to be in your intelligent parts of you because in in uh Strong's Concordance it says which is uh 1847 where it says knowledge there in Genesis says knowledge knowledge or perceptions skill uh discernment understanding or wisdom now that tree had to be a tree of wisdom smartness understandings Etc not just a tree see you're no different than than when you say that and placing Eve as to be the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the the you're you're no different than the denominations to say that it was an apple that they ate of you know because you're still off with the line of what the truth is about it right see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is Satan all right and the prophet said every time we take a bite off of the tree of knowledge now see he said we're still being perverted that's where it was at on the the the basis of Fellowship this past Wednesday all right see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and remember I laid a lot on this Wednesday night it was told to Adam before Eve was created right not to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil there is really no statements directly to Eve after she came in to be right right when she came into being there's no no scriptural statement to tell her to do that what the because that was said to Adam all right and being to that he said he didn't say now now Adam have you partaken of Eve when he come down he knew what was how what had happened right but he said Adam have you partaken of the tree of knowledge of good and evil or the tree that I told you not to partake of Lee he's the one that brought death upon the human race in Adam the Bible says all die and he refused Eve there wouldn't have been any death in the garden in that basis there would have been one death that would have been Eve but yet he loved her and you can say he topped Christ in the basis of going out to bring her back be very mildly using the type there of Christ because you don't want him to be partaking of the wrong thing you just want a covering to be made so all right but see when you say the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is Eve then so you're you're putting it back to a a point that I believe that it's the said is no more than believing an apple sure she was the tree sure Adam was not to partake of that tree until a certain time it's always say because you can argue the point see there are people who split churches and do different things over the basis of whether it was to be a physical intercourse in the garden to bring us into being or a creation I'm not going to argue with you either way I don't have enough time to because that's just irrelevant you can go quotes this way quote that's a way but it what is the point we know for certainty one thing the fall did come and then the prophet would say that ends that he said that ends from the beginning all right now when he says that he ends from the beginning that means there was no other way that could have ever come because God could not have displayed all of his attributes had there not been a fall in the garden right see so then we're looking at it in the correct form all right but as I said the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the when we'll read in just a minute when God didn't curse Eve he said well look what he done to it no he didn't curse her now you don't have to argue with the prophet so it's all right man I don't have no trouble with I just said what he says and you just get mad at me because I find money saying that's always been funny to me you know I mean I say something brother Brown said and then you get mad because I found it well that's all right but now listen so if Eve and Adam was not cursed if there was no physical contact why was the curse of the Beast then it fell now watch and you'll tie it together just a little bit I'm saying that well I want it you'll tie together just a little bit of how come the animals fall in the situation no polygamy but we won't cover that for a few minutes because I'd like to get you to thinking in a line at least because if I am a teacher I'd accept a point of saying that I am very slow and you know and and keep repeating myself and that's what we've done in school but we did learn didn't we one plus one equals two the next day the teacher says what is it one plus one equals two the next day the teacher said and for 300 how many days I mean 150 or 60 days ever today she said one plus one equals two no matter why you say teacher at least get on the two plus two you know because you've been on that but there's one thing about it it went into the memory bank of your brain your mind and you know what then you went and went to outer space right when they lifted off the Earth and went past the moon and all into the Stars what was it the basis was one plus one equals two that's right it wasn't like us kids used to say say how much is one plus one they said eleven kids didn't never joke about that one you need to hold them up like that you know but now listen if he didn't curse Adam let me pull this one up right where we got it okay go ahead Brother Anderson I'm going to jump you around today all right pull up to one paragraph 320 set 325 which is really 327 325 uh the future home preaching 64.0802 all right he'll get it up every time I get through reading a little and he's got in there all right paragraph 325 through 327. but that was the closest thing see they they can't find that species between the chimpanzee and the man so each one is evolved up from the birds and on up to the monkeys and so forth up to the chimpanzee then there's a lost that was the serpent not a snake and reform is lost from him because he was cursed all right what now God didn't curse Adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the Earth thorns and thistle he didn't curse Eve but said Adam would be her ruler from now on she ain't trying any preaching or anything Adam is her ruler and all the days of your life in sorrow and you'll bring forth bring your life into the Earth but he said I'll put enmity between your seat all right so now he didn't curse Adam and he didn't curse he but he cursed a snake he cursed the Beast put it on the ground as a crawling snake all right now you say well is that no no that wasn't the first creation of the snake because that wouldn't be Evolution creation right that wouldn't be creative evolution the snakes were there he just put him in the snakes some have inferred that that would be the poisonous snakes that's none of my business I don't really care he just went there anyway you know and uh I'm afraid of all of them yeah and and I have to say one thing for sure The Curse still is on the snake yeah okay right because if I find him you know and I know the difference in them so I want there's certain snakes we've got one up in the building our homes about we've got one that's five or six foot long and maybe this big around is an old chicken snake we don't kill him you know he's good for getting rats and things and and if I see a king snake I won't kill it I don't go around just killing every snack I see but if I see a poisonous one he doesn't have any change of it we were we were deer hunting one time and had this property and uh I went down to Sister pig and give me your stand and hunted one afternoon and that was the plan I was hunting afternoon she was a hunter morning she said see if anything was coming by for the whole day you know and uh so I was going down through and I heard something like foreign I better look around well I look around and I couldn't find no rattlesnake but we've got a little old snake that he's crazy for doing it I guess but he does it and that's his defense I forgot what the name's eraser but he'll stick up his tail and he'll rattle the leaves just like a rattlesnake I started to walk off because I knew it was not I thought Sister pig is coming in the morning if that comes out in the morning she's going to be scared so the old boy was hanging on a tree when she came in the next morning I told her about but get the point now he didn't curse Adam he didn't curse Eve he cursed a snake all right putting that snake in a position to where that there was oh no way to take him back right you understand why that you don't curse Adam and you don't curse Eve see whatever God curses is cursed now the world is cursed because it's not a soul of being apart but one day it will be renewed you know or made Eternal but it has to be totally burned over renovated Etc uh to be able to brought back but see the snake has no hopes whatsoever of being able to go back to be the Beast because he was cursed all right so then Satan would have to be cursed all the way through just getting a little points now watch then that alone of what we've covered or to say that he didn't conceive that he didn't curse Adam that he cursed the Beast should be enough to let us know what took place in the natural Act yeah Adam would go to tilling the ground he would go to the multiplication and that should show you what she'd done Adam falling to tilling the ground would be because of his part Eve because of her part would be the sorrows in childbearing right so that would show you what happened in the garden in the physical now whereas Eve was once co-equal with Adam right that's how beautiful she was made co-equal you said now she was a byproduct well see now what are you making about product we're going to read your Prophet said that she was co-equal so then you know you you're not you won't listen to it I know that you're not going to change people's mind I learned that a long time ago I used to think that you know if I could just walk down to people and just tell them that they would just say well that's right now you can tell them all you want to we're going to get on a quote in a minute from the prophet if marriage and divorce is not revealed and I'm going to say it like this I don't care if you were sitting there and heard it if it's not revealed to you what good is it that's right the whole world can read it is it any good for them no see then then get down and just think sensibly all right now so what happens with the fact and I want to get into that now and we'll get started on our message for this morning fun with the fact that Eve was created co-equal you know there was only one Covenant until the fall there wasn't two covenants when Adam was created and when Eve was taken from Adam that didn't make two Covenants no huh now when we get into that please don't run over to to uh Paul in his study of of the two covenants one from Mount Sinai and one from the Jerusalem which is above that's that's not exactly the covenants we're talking about that that would be you know you'd be going on over too far that's the two covenants Paul spoke of but that's not what happened in Genesis the two covenants all right but now before we start talking about the two covenants I want to just read these so look what the prophet says on paragraph 274 272 excuse me of marriage and divorce priests in 1965 221 in the morning service now under marriage and divorce it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it now I lost contact with a man years ago and I always say this to illustrate how that preachers and people will do not against him he was my brother I loved him he's dead and I loved a man but I lost contact with him because I used to he used to eat in my home or I'd be at his home or or you know sometimes once a week and telephone conversations sometimes daily uh you know and discussing the message and preaching for him at just all kind of times or anytime I wanted to go by there I could just stop by you know you know but I was preaching on the seals and I said this is my revelation a lot of you've heard this statement but it's making it as a point he said he sent word that he said I don't have a revelation said you said you had a revelation that's wrong he said I don't have a revelation he said I have the Revelation that brother random had the revelation well after all that was said and done that was kind of carnal because I said I had a revelation he said he had a revelation both of us were saying the same things but I didn't ever argue with a man no more I just loved him and forgot it forget it you know all right but now listen if it's not revealed see what he was saying wrote around and said it it's revealed that's what most of your people in the message say right right what do you mean revealed the prophet said it that is the Revelation no no it was a revelation to him right but now when you first worked brother random say one God did you have a revelation and believe that run off no no no no no no no right well if it was a revelation why didn't you because you'd only be saying what he says the Bible says no man can call Jesus or say that Christ is a curse except what by the Holy Ghost himself okay see it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it but he promised in the last days why didn't Paul and all of them preach about marriage and divorce very much or the serpent seed or the the things I thought it would be the last day where would it be at in this age where we're at that every hidden Mystery in the Bible will be revealed how many knows that Revelations the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it that all of these hidden mysteries on on marriage and divorce and all these other Hidden Mysteries that's been revealed would be revealed in the end time now where did he say it come from he goes on to the seventh angel number two where did he say it come from which is from marriage and divorce paragraph 311 where did it come from God bore me witness on that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word let them go on in as they are and sin no more Supernatural Revelation has God revealed to you that that is your wife but that is your husband as he revealed all right then if it's been revealed see then there's no way of of uh breaking that you see why I say it this way and I know it's Natural praying carnal but you know I never have after I come in the message and heard what the prophet had to say about it and things and and how he placed things together you know I've never worried about my wife running around on me I mean not more than one reasons first off she's Christian she would have done it so that means she's not a Christian she died all right so she needs to get straight well second off if she's going to make it in she's gonna have to come back and tell me about it it's going to be straighten it up somewhere so I don't have to worry about it right you say well that's a funny way I love my wife's a reason because that's cornelling he said well these are not trust you I love her well I a lot of people love women that and Men you know different things it didn't solve a lot of problems right right okay so now what do we got something that's got to be revealed have you asked God to reveal to you marriage and divorce no I was sitting there when he said it wonderful but did God drop down to you speak it may I say that what they say about the future home that when brother Branham came out he said I can count on Billy Paul or something did you get it yeah Daddy I got it or something like that you know something going on he said I count on my hand how many got it and also I heard last night where sister Freda she's not here all right they said that brother Perry green coughed up that cancer that was down in his throat or something and it was like a spider that was spitting out of him and I prayed to God I believe you know that God is still the Healer and I know he had been real sick now I'm quoting from Sister Freda that got her information from somebody else and I pray that that God I still believe he's a Healer I I do that I don't have any problems all right but now listen I'll read in a minute where brother Brown was a saying that she in such a high place how could she do what she done you realize what co-equal means is there any sinful situation could be encounted in between Adam and Eve in the beginning and it would be calling co-equal foreign form of sinful situation whatever you want to think about don't make them co-equal sinners let's don't go that way okay how could she be co-equal and her be created wrong that's that's just all I want to know I'm full of questions because look what your Prophet had to say and you say well now we know about the two covenants but what about the first Covenant go ahead brother number three think of a marriage divorce program 195 194 excuse me 65 221 the morning now notice after the fall Jesus said beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that and watch the Covenant was co-equal right so with only one Covenant but now after the fall there is another covenant made now she was no longer a ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant now first it was just one Covenant koiqua let's read the next one before I make my comments back up go ahead to number four paragraph 104 marriage and divorce why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him we've all known now that she lost her co-equaleness with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from here on here out now that's the scripture all right but now think about it she was co-equal no sinful situation whatsoever but then he had to make another Covenant we'll read in a second where he says one with a product and one with a byproduct so then you develop into what B that's the title of the message today two Covenants but as I said let's don't go over now in the two covenants to Paul dealing with the the people there in the scriptures and all I got written somewhere in here don't go over there trying to talk about the two Covenants because you got one from Mount Sinai which is the law and then you got the other one from from uh Heavenly Jerusalem which is from above so don't go into that form of two covenants keep it back in the garden where we're at now two Covenants a double Covenant he says a separate Covenant now I want to ask you a simple question is there one way for a woman to be saved and another way for the man to be saved and that's what it sounds like doesn't it because it sounds like just two covenants when you don't express it you just read it it sounds like two Covenants and he's not explaining these things as much because he's got a lengthy message to preach well yet he says two Covenants I Covenant with her and a covenant with him well I thought there was only one Covenant of salvation right there would be man woman Jew Gentile who whatever there's only one Covenant of salvation there's not two Covenants it's not the woman got her special way and the man got his special way and we're all Born Again amen brought into the Covenant of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost whether it be male or female right so get that part out of your mind and it'll help you to understand what's really being said that you're not talking about the prophet is not talking about the salvation of a soul or how to be saved he said well brother Dale I can take you over and okay go ahead and run over all you want to you're going to come back where I'm at because you say I can go to the to the invisible Union where she's got this and that's right we'll get to that wonderful that is but that's something natural the Bible says Jonah 2 9. oh me there's only one salvation salvation to the Lord that's why I said to start with marriage and divorce won't send you to hell because whatever you make out of it is an attribute on the physical side they won't send you to hell but blaspheme in the Holy Ghost will what if blaspheming the Holy Ghost the prophet said it's attributing the works of God to the devil that's right amen so if you sat down and frown up and you say blaspheme and Holy Ghost go ahead do what you want to do that's your choice well God I don't believe I didn't say God you didn't believe it like I believe it if you don't believe what the Bible says and the prophet says and that's unbelief now questions about this no problems there's no problems with questions about God's word that's not blaspheming the Holy Ghost you realize what he's just saying they're tripping in the works of God to the devil in other words you said the devil said that the devil's done that the devil taught that the devil made him do that when it was God you better be careful in marriage and divorce because you've got a lot of things to cover that is really stressing upon the human mind God told the prophet one day to go marry a prostitute and have children by her right I think she run off and left him I believe it's right he went back and got her again you won't try to explain that I'm not that's one of the things I won't tackle because it's not been revealed to me I'll talk about anything that's been revealed but when it ain't revealed I leave that alone but I just know it's dark you tell me that how that brother Brown said Bathsheba was made for David now you tell me about that and I don't know that's what he's saying okay got a lot of questions just go over what the Lord's revealed to what we have all right so then it's not talking about a covenant of salvation for the woman and a covenant of salvation for the man all are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ all are saved by uh an indwelling of the spirit of almighty God into our souls to make us Eternal beings and you don't find in the Old Testament anywhere uh sacrifice is separate that that the woman had to make except for her purification so that shows you where the curse went see all right but it's still not salvation you know everybody understand me where I can move on what do you believe what I believe or not that's all right I don't ask you to believe it I ask you to consider it right salvation is based upon the blood of Jesus Christ not upon the basis of what we do in the flesh or haven't done we're not saved because we're so goody goody but we're neither safe because we're so bad we're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ all right salvation but now what's these two covenants then what is these two Covenants what do you think about it where once it was just one Covenant and they were co-equal then another Covenant comes into being equal and it's automatically it says to the woman that you were under your husband and he'll rule over you two Covenants go ahead with number five paragraph 195 198 excuse me when I'd eat 199 of marriage and divorce two Covenants now that closes the beginning in other words in back there in the beginning when he created man and woman equal one Covenant fall closes that no way to get back finished now you got two Covenants all right what are those two Covenants two covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning we got another notice it's another Covenant now there's a covenant for the product and the byproduct notice the fall brought trouble death to every creature of the creation making a difference in all nature now let us notice what Jesus said about it from the beginning it wasn't so now it is not so from it is now it is after the beginning now there is a double Covenant first was just a covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal one man one woman another woman sinned and what does she do that drove them all to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant here it is right here in Genesis 3 16 he made another Covenant all right now but random knew about these a lot of these things back in his early Ministry you get in conduct order and Doctrine especially and he'll say the Lord has made ways in places like this before you know he's stating things but he can't come out and preach on it but he knows on back in his early Ministry some things so let's read a couple of them 64 was marriage and divorce right 65 excuse me all right looking 63 number six the evening messenger 63 11 A 1 16. paragraph 308 309 306 307. look what he says then you'll begin to develop an idea and I see right now I'm going to not get through these two covenants this morning no problem the Bible said it's a shame for a man to have long hair looks like a woman God made two now watch you one with Adam one with Eve he dressed him different they're different all together they're almost always been different there's two covenants right on down through the Bible I'd like to preach on that double Covenant one night sometimes show you what the difference is oh my is tremendous it's even in your marriage and divorce so now you say well what's higher and clothes Got to Do with It okay it's tremendous that even in your marriage and divorce case if you only knew the truth on that would settle that whole matter that's right all right again now while we be sure now come won't you talking about her and clothes and he's tying it to the two Covenants of marriage and divorce okay going to the next one from that time E90 62 713 talking about women and their privilege they were doing and forcing the rights and I say I can dress the way I want to it's none of your business it's not me brother sister it's the Bible God made a man and he made him dress like a man and he made a woman to dress like a woman made them act different and made two covenants with them and everything else always been now find me any word in the message that he speaks the double Covenant form and puts it to be salvation as I tried to express a moment ago he's not cursed Adam is not cursed a double Covenant appears because of the Fall both of them have an opportunity to be saved by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but you see we haven't been taught that it was wrong to do things that's why like my wife will always tell you there's one thing for sure if you've come here as much as five years you've heard marriage and divorce any of you girls and boys don't have no excuse we even had a discussion one time with the girls and my wife and I took them and sat down with them and talked with him about what marriages were and what things were was going to get to the boys we never did get to see them I guess we need to go now and get them but you don't have an excuse you here you don't you don't say well well we don't know brother that we haven't been taught this maybe some of you that had come later you you've never been probably taught marriage and divorce you've never been taught that a boy and girl should do nothing but even they shouldn't even hold hands and things until they're engaged and no kissing until the wedding takes place the veil lifted we went through that we will go through it again you see because I've tried to explain to you and how many girls in here could say you've never kissed my boy you know somebody other than your husband I had to raise our hands on that one time and and I said it in a way that was you know boys and girls is dating dude and I only had one couple here that said that they never kissed until they were married now I'll have to answer this honestly they didn't say they never kissed anybody else because I didn't ask that question I was asking if they had not kissed me by dating you know all right that's why there's a lot of things that jump when you come to me and want to know about getting married we have a lot of discussions about things but it's only for the basis of trying to be right I'm not trying to be Lord over I'm trying to be right and I'm trying to get you to be right well then if there is no hopes with the grace of marriage and divorce then we must rule that to be the major factor of our lives and must gain ground towards that but can you can you receive the grace of marriage and divorce if it's not revealed to you that that's the only question I have go to that way you can just go over here to the neighbor and say marriage and divorce have been preached you believe brother Brown was a prophet everything's okay now he said to my followers only don't tell your neighbors about marriage and divorce come on Lulu we'll get you straightened out now you come up here you're going to find out how bad we are you can't take this to the world you can't do that church it's not for the world it's for the Believers only all right and the Believers in this message only all right so let's think about what he's saying and he said that where do we read that he gave the scripture well we want to look at number and let me read a little bit look at number eight you'll find this is about five paragraphs of marriage and divorce there we go so remember as we're starting on the talk the two Covenants the you're thinking about what are you doing brother Dale I'm trying my best to figure out a way to say things to where you can understand it and it follows the correct way so if I pause and wait that's just the old human mind I ain't that smart sometimes if we didn't run our mouth so much we might be able to you know we've got two ears and one mouth right what does that mean twice as much listening as there is run in the mouth right okay now if I don't get through with this we'll come back to it but the main point I want you to get because he gives you the scriptures all right so this would be paragraph 194 and it'll go all the way up to 200 or something of marriage and divorce preaching 65 to 21 in the morning service now notice now after the fall after the beginning After Time begin back in the eternity it was a eternity back and that was eternity is over notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there was a need to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you the scripture to prove that this is the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there is another covenant made now she is no longer ruler with him are we right now she's no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant I'm going to stop there because I go any further I'm going to tie up a lot of things okay let me just preach a minute and then we'll we'll end it so the two covenants is not the Mount Sinai eye Paul which is Hagar and you know the Heavenly Jerusalem it's not that Covenant all right the two covenants in the garden if he didn't curse Adam and he didn't curse Eve then are you dealing with a death situation that's the point I want you to look at why didn't he just kill Eve now of course we got it in the message how come you know they got into the message that Adam grabbed Eve and throwed her on the ground and had intercourse with her and that saved her if that's true Brother Gary let's go back down on 10th Street and start over again right with the hippies with all of the doings some of you don't like the way I talk but I'm sorry at least I get you to think some of you think this old boy don't know what he's talking about how many of you've ever looked up polygamy to see what it means we got a little bit to look at this afternoon so we'll hold that point but if you ever just looked at it to see what it means I said it meant only for a man with more than one wife I got the Bible now what do you got he said not just male or female I know what the word polygamy means but I got the Bible what do you got did Eve have more than one husband yes because she had two different partners which does not have to be recognized as marriage is according to the law I'm quoting Wikipedia all right so we'll listen this afternoon give you something to think about but think about it now for a second if God didn't curse Adam and he didn't curse Eve then why is so much damnation preached against women right that old byproduct one you gave to me I told you I don't like jokes I like jokes that are good clean fun yes listen to them take last night wrote around and said you know God even had a sense of humor was sin okay good but he said God's got a sense of humor now you tell God he sinned you remember when he said Jesus said that now go tell that fox there was some joke about Herod being called a fox Jesus knew the joke and he said it but you see that's where we just take a quote we eat ourselves to death by it but if it was no curse put on Adam and no curse put on Eve you know cursed cursed means destroyed or annihilated something that's cursed now you want scripture how can you curse what God has blessed is that scripture right so the curse was placed upon the snake serpent but not on Adam and Eve if it depend on Adam and Eve they would have both been destroyed at that time because whatever you want to take whatever you want to do however how much you want to try to preach that Adam was not deceived that makes him that much worse because he partook of the ACT physically knowing amen what would take place now you argue that point right he knew what was going to take place that's why the Bible says in Adam all die doesn't say an eve but he won't blame me for everything right sure she done what she done my brother Brandon said on one side she is the the example of everything vulgar and and all but he said on the other side said she's the example of all things that are pure and true a good wife is a good wife hey I know I can understand a lot of things but you know there were some good women back there in the Bible right there was some real good women back there and some of those husbands love those women they were good women but some of them you know done what that wife said sometimes got them all messed up see everybody just thinks a woman is a garbage can you know to an Israelite a woman is a secondary product if you think they don't know what the fall is why is it and see the people of this message preach that there's no salvation for women outside of having a head meaning physically you never heard a preach on it you must have been asleep her husband her head but if her daddy's dead and her husband's dead she's got one head and that's God if she's a true Christian and she's doing what's right see the years when we get out none of that headship but the point is thinking Adam and Eve wasn't cursed to death they didn't have dialed right to her the day you eat thereof that day you'll die which means they didn't live a thousand years because God had done said that but you know Adam and Eve wasn't lost right oh you can take that about Adam can't you well why is it that Adam got a skin to put on why didn't Eve just get the skin I like for you to think Adam partook knowing what he was doing yes and that put the whole human race under sin we don't want to blame Adam we don't blame the woman well you know she wasn't cursed that's what you get you get the preacher's a message you listen you you got cursed women everywhere that's oh now there's a certain line there now if y'all keep that line pretty straight right down that line right there y'all maybe you'll not be able to be saved now show me in the Bible where there's a certain line for a woman to be saved and a certain line for the man to be saved right uh we're going to get into some questions one of these days you know Paul maybe sometimes it's hard to be understood but you know Paul spoke of a man having a virginity as well as a woman but it's not said about him just read the next paragraph the next paragraph says he has to marry a virgin now you are self-interpreting no man has a right to marry a woman that's not a virgin oh Abigail only after her husband was dead this thing lays so close until what did the prophet say he said it's even into Heathen race when that King will get to it eventually that's right as quick as he found out that that was Abraham's wife but he immediately run back with her and said I was deceived the Lord said I know you would that's why I didn't kill you but you see we thank the man he can just go out and do what he wants to but see neither one of them was cursed if they can't be saved amen right because he's not talking about a double Covenant being you know two covenants being two different ways of being saved I'll say this words in any end y'all come ahead musicians we'll be dealing this afternoon with the manner of life because there's your double Covenant I gave you the reasons and that man for woman cutting her hair man's supposed to have short hair and woman first half long hair supposed to dress different he said that's the double Covenant he showed you right there I want the double Covenant would be not that Eve was so lustful and Adam was so beautiful wonderful right you know what brother Dale I want to know this out the other get on down there we get on down there we got to go here first right all right sisters are going preparing for the lunch together I thank God he's given me 73 years three years above what I've promised so I'm on vacation I'm on borrowed time he didn't know it to me some of you may say I wish it had took him in the 70s so I went out to put up with him but that's all right you may not like my former's preaching or ways but there's one thing about it when it's finished we got something to stand on there's never been challenged by anyone out there to say you're wrong and that's a statement now that you say well are you arrogant or hateful no I'm just truthful because if you put down the word in the correct order they won't say nothing to you now they'll go around the corner and talk all they want to and that's all right he'll get out there and just blah blah blah blah you know brother devils are all messed up but you know what if the man paid me a compliment one time he told me he said I heard two brothers talking about you brother Dale I said what he said one of them said you said so and so he said I told him you didn't say it he said God I know you and I know you wouldn't say that I said thank you brother that was a compliment the fact that he knowed I wouldn't say it you just think about brother Branham standing there and Billy Paul coming to him and said Daddy will you marry me in Lois he says no they got married somewhere by somebody and there's no record that brother random didn't go to the wedding you say there's no record he did okay we're standing 50 50. no problem right he was the one that got it in all for that girl you know but then he turned around and he said that's a wedding but did he condemn Billy to hell or call him an adulteress and he called lost an adulteress for marrying him that would make two wives no don't you think he felt good when God told him the truth of marriage and divorce told them to go on as they are because he's seen his own son this is serious it's not play matters he said well what does it do to our Salvation it may not have nothing to do with the point of whether you're born again or not but this thing here that you're looking at is involved of course if we believe like everybody in the message tries to believe you're going to get you a new body a different one well I guess that's okey dokey throw it away let's get us another one but if we're going to believe what the prophet said he didn't believe in that right now how can you be that carnal in your mind if you don't see Satan in his subtility like he was in the garden approaching your mind the way he did there why in the world would a preacher get up in the pulpit and say I'm going to get me a new body I'm going to throw this in a way when the prophet said Resurrection is not replacement he said Jesus come up with the same body went down in but I believe the prophet and everything he said you know I believe Satan is still in the simplicity let's Stand Together that's just saying a verse while we're waiting on the what we got waiting on their sister to get ready for us to go eat together I invite you to come eat my birthday of course you had to cook it in my room wow person thank you you ever got down to you just didn't know what to say and how to pray and a burden on your heart then they start singing it to him in your relationships good morning me my mother 's day come on wow always foreign a double Covenant but he's not talking about salvation so it must mean something in this life you ready all right let's think of that something in this life there was only one Covenant in the beginning there'll only be one Covenant in glory that's right Regional Covenant was correct an obeyed a way to be in heaven and what about it father we thank you for this day and what we've tried to say Lord just help us in understanding open our understanding to the people especially in order to what we've tried to say because there's nobody trying to condemn nobody we're all in a big old mess called life but we know who can straighten everything out make all things right Lord we just ask you now to go with us as we go eat a natural meal sanctify the food to our bodies and us into your kingdom that we may be what you want us to be Just Have Your Way Lord guide us now in Jesus name you dismissed there is God day with no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky go Shore what a day glorious day that will be when my dreams National Snyder look upon his face the one who said Me by his grace and he takes me by land and leave me through that Promised Land for the day a glorious day let me know
