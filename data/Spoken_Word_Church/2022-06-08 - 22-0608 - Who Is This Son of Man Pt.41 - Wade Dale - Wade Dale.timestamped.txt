[9:41] tonight
[9:43] i want to read you this little quote and
[9:44] then we're going to uh get right into
[9:46] the word of god
[9:48] the prophet of god in the world falling
[9:49] apart is this world not falling apart
[9:53] they're saying now that a dozen eggs
[9:55] will be 12
[9:57] a dozen
[9:59] by august
[10:01] talk about inflation this is what
[10:03] happened in 1929 and 30 when the market
[10:06] crashed
[10:07] they were selling fl flour at the end
[10:10] that time for 10 and 15 dollars for a
[10:12] pound of flour
[10:14] pound of flour just a little pound of
[10:15] flour
[10:16] to make stuff with so you uh
[10:20] we need we need the lord not to get us
[10:22] out of this we need the lord to get us
[10:24] out of this world
[10:25] and man i don't want to dodge the
[10:27] bullets
[10:28] i want to be gone
[10:30] i want to get out of here and i think
[10:32] that's what we're trying to do this last
[10:33] push we've had almost 20 people baptized
[10:36] and uh i told brother boyd standing in
[10:38] the back i said all those that are
[10:40] baptized i hope they either will fill
[10:41] with the holy ghost can get more or
[10:43] they're going to be filled with the holy
[10:44] ghost and we'll have a good time amen
[10:46] because that's what we're going to try
[10:47] to talk on we're going to get to the
[10:49] baptism of the holy ghost this afternoon
[10:51] or this evening so brother adam says
[10:52] given a prophet this is world falling
[10:54] apart in 1963
[10:56] they were given a prophet what they do
[10:57] each time they stoned them because they
[11:00] didn't agree with their system
[11:02] and put them to death
[11:03] jesus said you garnish the walls of the
[11:05] prophets and the tombs and your fathers
[11:07] is the one to put them in there
[11:09] and you testify that
[11:11] that's your children see they do it it's
[11:13] just too bad
[11:14] but that's the world see it's always god
[11:17] sends his word and wisdom
[11:20] tries to in other words verse
[11:22] the word
[11:23] that's the way it was at the beginning
[11:25] the very thing started the whole system
[11:27] of sin was because somebody eve
[11:29] satan produced a better plan than god's
[11:34] see we think we got a worldly plan to
[11:36] make it through this thing nope nope
[11:38] sorry
[11:39] satan produced a better plan than god's
[11:41] he produced wisdom
[11:42] they ate from the tree of knowledge
[11:45] wisdom always takes you away from god
[11:48] faith brings you back to god
[11:50] you don't know you don't know god by
[11:53] your great wisdom
[11:56] it's no good it's of the world it's
[11:58] foolishness to god but it pleased god
[12:01] through the foolishness of preaching his
[12:03] word to save the lost so god always uses
[12:06] somebody foolish
[12:07] and simple so here he is today
[12:10] foodless and simple that's me
[12:14] and you come to hear the word of god
[12:16] you didn't come to hear me you come to
[12:17] hear the word of god so let's buy our
[12:19] heads
[12:20] lord jesus thank you for this
[12:21] opportunity we have to stand before the
[12:25] greatest group of people that ever came
[12:26] on the face of this earth
[12:28] the people that the bible
[12:30] was written about
[12:32] lord we know that many prophets and
[12:34] seers and different ones down through
[12:36] the ages
[12:37] we're looking for a group of people like
[12:39] this lord that was gonna
[12:41] bind the
[12:42] acts of satan
[12:44] right here in his eden
[12:46] and lord i pray that you and
[12:48] that you will
[12:49] identify us
[12:51] we are the bride lord i pray that you'll
[12:53] identify us by signs and wonders and
[12:55] giving people the holy ghost and by the
[12:57] many things that we need lord

[13:38] amen
[13:49] i had toby laying in my lap yesterday
[13:54] he'd already died
[13:56] and i told him i said i'm sorry
[14:01] i'm sorry toby that i can't speak your
[14:02] life back into you
[14:04] i'm sorry i'm such a sorry person
[14:08] that i haven't been able to manifest
[14:10] what the bible tells us to manifest
[14:13] but don't you worry little little kid
[14:15] i'll see you again
[14:18] we'll be with our the ones that we love
[14:22] but have you ever done that before have
[14:23] you ever come to a situation that said
[14:25] i'm supposed to be able to handle this
[14:27] what about a prophet with a possum
[14:30] that's what i'm looking for you say well
[14:31] that's for that's for that's for the
[14:33] prophet to god well there's the door you
[14:34] need to go find you on
[14:37] it's a manifestation of these sons and
[14:39] daughters of god
[14:40] us that have the baptism of the holy
[14:42] ghost that that
[14:44] maybe our lives are not always the way
[14:46] it's supposed to be we're not living
[14:47] exactly the sharpness that we should be
[14:49] living to where we can look down at an
[14:51] animal
[14:52] and say life come back into that animal
[14:55] that burdens my heart not for just a
[14:56] little toby we'll see him again i mean
[14:59] he's in a better place but
[15:01] us on this side
[15:03] is the ones i'm worried about i'm
[15:05] worried about the ones on this side that
[15:07] we can come to that situation and be
[15:08] able to speak in that
[15:10] and that life breath of life goes right
[15:12] back into that
[15:13] dog we've seen it with humans
[15:16] we've seen it with different ones we've
[15:17] seen it with animals
[15:19] but lord i wanted to see where like
[15:20] brother brown says like it's popping
[15:22] popcorn to where every time we speak
[15:25] something happens
[15:26] amen so let's read this who is this son
[15:28] of man
[15:29] this is part number 41.
[15:31] john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was
[15:33] the word where it was with god the word
[15:35] was god
[15:36] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[15:38] among us and we beheld his glory
[15:40] the glory of the only begotten of the
[15:41] father
[15:42] full of grace and truth you may be
[15:44] seated the lord has his blessing to the
[15:46] reading of the word
[15:50] now we've been talking about just to
[15:51] back up a little bit for
[15:53] our visit or something we were talking
[15:55] about this has been a a 41 or 42 sermons
[16:00] on the life of a man called jesus christ
[16:04] but now not only the life of jesus
[16:06] christ back in history but the life of
[16:08] jesus christ and a group of people today
[16:11] amen and when we come to this place that
[16:13] we look in scripture and we see ourself
[16:16] and we see the time that we're living in
[16:19] we see that god has given us provision
[16:22] to make it to this time he has given us
[16:25] what a predestinated plan
[16:28] as we see there predestinated to
[16:30] adoption according to the book of
[16:31] ephesians we are predestinated in this
[16:33] end time to adoption so adoption is
[16:37] placing adoption is not just getting the
[16:39] holy ghost adoption is
[16:41] like i was talking about just it's god
[16:43] moving and god acting in everything that
[16:45] you do and everything that you see you
[16:47] know and it's not look it's not a
[16:49] flowery bed of ease it's not going to be
[16:50] that you're going to lay out on a cloud
[16:52] and your bills are going to quit coming
[16:54] due and you know your neighbor's going
[16:56] to
[16:57] instantly start liking you and
[16:59] you know it's not going to happen that
[17:01] way we know that but it does make things
[17:03] a lot better if we do have the baptism
[17:05] of the holy ghost and have these virtues
[17:08] working in our life
[17:09] as i said before the prophet of god
[17:12] tells us that it becomes a stumbling
[17:13] block
[17:14] if we are christians and then we have
[17:16] these little rough edges that we that
[17:18] people see that we have to deal with
[17:20] the little rough edges and that's what i
[17:21] want to
[17:23] next sunday we'll deal on or this coming
[17:25] sunday we'll deal with those rough edges
[17:26] because that's what faith that's what
[17:28] knowledge temperance patience guidelines
[17:30] brotherly kindness all that is knocking
[17:32] off the rough edges
[17:34] because remember you get everything you
[17:35] need when you get the holy ghost but you
[17:38] got everything in your in your being
[17:40] when you were born to be a mother to be
[17:42] a father to be a car driver to be
[17:45] somebody that can fill out a checkbook
[17:47] but you're not going to do that until
[17:48] you reach what the age of accountability
[17:51] or the age where you mature enough to
[17:53] where you'll be able to make a what a
[17:55] sound decision
[17:56] on all these matters same way with the
[17:58] word of god he's not going to give it
[18:00] we've been reading and reading and
[18:01] reading where where paul gets tells i've
[18:03] been feeding you milk i've been feeding
[18:05] you milk i've been feeding your milk i'm
[18:07] trying to feed you strong meat but i'm
[18:09] telling you what strong meat is what's
[18:10] going to make you feel better it's going
[18:12] to make you grow milk's going to be okay
[18:15] but you can't keep a baby on milk all
[18:16] the time
[18:18] and man so you got to grow up in god
[18:22] and we were looking now at the three
[18:24] stages of adoption the first stage is
[18:26] obviously
[18:27] you got to start with the birth you got
[18:29] to start where you get into the body of
[18:30] christ you got to get into this family
[18:33] of god
[18:34] because these virtues are not human
[18:38] virtues they're not virtues that humanly
[18:40] you're going to be able to just
[18:42] completely because remember virtue if
[18:45] you look up the word virtue in an
[18:47] encyclopedia it means being virtuous or
[18:49] being a virgin
[18:51] all right well you can be a virgin and
[18:53] die and go to
[18:54] hell in your physical being
[18:57] amen
[18:58] so that really has nothing to do it is
[19:00] it is according to god's word you need
[19:02] to be one before you get married
[19:05] but it's not a requirement for salvation
[19:08] it's a requirement that you be virgin up
[19:10] here
[19:12] everybody with me
[19:13] i'm gonna try to just do it a little bit
[19:14] slow i was gonna speed through this but
[19:18] i feel like i need to drop it back just
[19:20] a minute
[19:22] because the first stage is the birth now
[19:24] what is a natural birth it's water
[19:27] blood
[19:28] and life
[19:29] everybody with me
[19:31] all right it's water it's got to come
[19:33] the water's got to break the blood's got
[19:35] to come and then smack the baby on the
[19:37] rear end and the baby cries that's when
[19:40] that baby's soul enters its body is
[19:43] everybody with me
[19:44] all right now we know that by the
[19:46] prophet of god and we know that
[19:48] and and i'm not going to argue when
[19:50] conception and life and and all these
[19:52] other roe versus wade you that
[19:55] i take what the prophet of god said
[19:57] prophet of god said you're wiggling
[19:58] muscles until you come forth and god
[20:00] breathes the breath of life inside of
[20:02] you so okay so all right you're just
[20:04] wiggling muscles and you're getting
[20:05] ready to be birthed but you know what
[20:06] you're not birthed yet right
[20:09] we're not birthed yet if you're not if
[20:10] you're in justification and
[20:12] sanctification you haven't been born
[20:13] again yet
[20:14] you're still what yeah you had a first
[20:16] birth i can see that i'm looking at it
[20:18] right here i see your first birth
[20:21] and it was wrong it's killing you
[20:24] remember the scripture tells us that
[20:25] we're supposed to we're supposed to what
[20:27] do we do we we are joyous and happy and
[20:29] have a all kind of a big party for the
[20:31] birth of a baby the bible doesn't tell
[20:33] us that the bible tells us we're
[20:35] supposed to cry when a baby's born and
[20:37] rejoice when a saint goes to heaven we
[20:40] get it totally reversed
[20:42] we cry like a baby when somebody goes to
[20:44] heaven and we just you know this little
[20:45] baby just we look it's born dead
[20:50] time goes on long enough that baby will
[20:53] die
[20:54] so we're born with death inside of us
[20:58] natural death
[21:00] and if we're not born again by the
[21:02] spirit of god it's a spiritual death and
[21:05] to me that's worse than a natural death
[21:09] bible says don't fear the one that can
[21:11] kill your body
[21:12] you better fear the one who can kill
[21:13] your soul and the only one that can kill
[21:15] your soul is the one that gave you the
[21:16] soul
[21:17] but in between that point and that point
[21:19] there's got to be a change
[21:22] there's got to be a change there's got
[21:24] to be a place to where we become sons
[21:27] and daughters of god and we start
[21:28] changing our attitude and it's it's uh
[21:30] we got to quit the things that we did
[21:32] before because the things that we did
[21:34] before what does that get us that got us
[21:36] death
[21:38] right that's what we're looking at now
[21:39] this is what got us death our first
[21:40] birth that's why jesus told nicodemus
[21:42] that ye must be what born again
[21:46] not born from your mother again born
[21:48] from heaven
[21:51] and christ has got to come down and
[21:52] we'll read that in just for just a
[21:54] minute let's hurry through this pretty
[21:55] quick right here this point and then
[21:56] i'll stop and slow down
[21:58] romans 8 verse 14 says romanians are
[22:01] look led by the spirit of god i want you
[22:03] to look at these these words lead
[22:06] power
[22:07] uh and and all these things that the
[22:09] holy ghost is going to give supposed to
[22:11] give us when we get born again everybody
[22:13] with me on that and we'll get to that in
[22:14] just a little bit
[22:16] but as many as are led by the spirit of
[22:18] god they are the sons of god how many
[22:20] were led by the spirit of the devil
[22:21] before they were led by the spirit well
[22:23] everyone even raised your hand everybody
[22:25] everybody raise your hand because you're
[22:27] going to testify you were a son
[22:30] and daughter of the devil before you
[22:33] became a son and daughter of god you
[22:34] were not born a son of god
[22:37] now in the mind of god yes but not right
[22:39] here you've got to make a choice you've
[22:41] got to come to a place to where you got
[22:44] to what you got to be sick and tired of
[22:47] being sick and tired
[22:49] and that's what i hope we've come to
[22:50] that's why i always pray for my kids and
[22:52] your kids anybody that's
[22:55] that's kind of wavering on the on the
[22:57] fence i say lord
[22:59] stir their water don't let them sleep
[23:01] let them have the most restless night
[23:06] and i mean that
[23:08] i want to see that person in about three
[23:10] days you know about half
[23:12] asleep i said what's wrong they said we
[23:14] can't go to sleep i said praise the lord
[23:15] keep them up a few more days
[23:18] clean them out lord
[23:19] clean them out
[23:21] keep them keep them up just a little bit
[23:22] longer
[23:24] and fill them with the holy ghost
[23:25] because we need some holy ghost filled
[23:26] people's what we need amen for as many
[23:28] as are led by the spirit of god they are
[23:30] not going to be they are the sons of god
[23:32] for ye have not received the spirit now
[23:35] look at all this spirit
[23:36] spirit you don't receive the spirit of
[23:38] bondage but you receive the spirit of
[23:40] adoption whereby you cry as a baby
[23:43] father father our daddy daddy the spirit
[23:46] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[23:48] that we are the children of god
[23:50] now remember we got to look back and
[23:52] we'll see in a minute that that ezekiel
[23:54] and the different ones tell us
[23:56] that you get a new spirit
[23:58] and then he puts his spirit in
[24:00] all right so we're talking about a
[24:02] spiritual thing this is not a natural
[24:04] happening today this is the spiritual
[24:06] happening
[24:07] the only way i know that you've got the
[24:09] holy ghost or you know that i've got the
[24:10] holy ghost is what we manifest on the
[24:12] outside it's not that we get this tattoo
[24:15] or this 666 that we're going to have the
[24:17] mark of the beast over here and it's
[24:18] going to have a big number in the
[24:20] forehead and no come on people good
[24:22] grief we know that it's in your forehead
[24:24] not on your forehead what is inside your
[24:26] forehead intelligence
[24:28] your intelligence is inside your head
[24:30] and that's where the devil is going to
[24:32] play
[24:34] that's his playground
[24:36] that we are the children of god and of
[24:37] children than heirs heirs of god
[24:40] wow and join heirs with christ
[24:42] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[24:43] may also be glorified together so we got
[24:46] to start with justification we were
[24:48] talking about
[24:49] last sunday
[24:51] but what says we the word is nightly
[24:52] even thy mouth in the heart the word of
[24:54] faith which we preach
[24:56] that thou shalt confess with thy mouth
[24:58] the lord jesus that's why no baptizing
[25:01] in titles how can you baptize entitled
[25:03] father son and holy ghost and be and be
[25:06] excuse me and be identified with
[25:07] somebody
[25:09] there there is a each one of us come
[25:11] from a family of whatever your life's
[25:13] name is
[25:14] and you're identified with that okay
[25:17] we're everyone human beings right
[25:19] we're everyone's spiritual beings too
[25:21] where everyone we we're most of us are
[25:23] fathers most of us are mothers and sons
[25:26] and we got all these different titles
[25:30] but look there's you know 60 people
[25:32] sitting in here right now
[25:33] who am i talking to
[25:35] why are you talking to everybody no i
[25:37] need one specific person
[25:40] so what i do i call you by name
[25:43] ruth mcferrin because he just walked in
[25:44] the door
[25:46] ruth made fear well then now
[25:49] john durrett didn't jump up and go
[25:50] that's me
[25:52] right
[25:53] you're identified by your name that's
[25:55] why we baptize in the name of the lord
[25:57] jesus christ because it is identifying
[25:59] who we are
[26:01] and what we're heading toward we're
[26:02] going into the family of god so we need
[26:04] that name
[26:06] when you're born what name do you get
[26:08] the name of your family you get a family
[26:11] name all right not just human
[26:13] everybody's a human
[26:15] but one specific person you got a name
[26:17] and there's only one name that whereby
[26:20] we can be saved and whereby we need to
[26:21] be baptized and that's the name of the
[26:23] lord jesus christ
[26:24] and if thou shalt confess with thy mouth
[26:26] the lord jesus and believe in your heart
[26:28] that god hath raised him from the dead
[26:30] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[26:32] man believeth unto righteousness and
[26:33] with the mouth confession is made unto
[26:35] salvation
[26:36] when we come to this place of
[26:37] justification we've got to come to a
[26:39] place
[26:41] thinking back on my life you look at you
[26:42] look at your life
[26:44] there's no way you can justify yourself
[26:46] there's no way you can clean yourself up
[26:47] god's the only one who can clean you up
[26:49] but if you're so sorrowful where you're
[26:51] where you come to a place and say god i
[26:53] don't want to do that anymore
[26:55] see that's why people say
[26:57] the do's and don'ts part is well i got
[26:59] the holy ghost because
[27:01] i quit that don't have nothing to do
[27:03] with it i wanted you to get that out of
[27:05] your mind
[27:07] it's not do's and don'ts that the holy
[27:09] ghost now justification you won't do
[27:11] what you used to do
[27:13] but you still got that unclean spirit in
[27:15] you and you can do
[27:17] if you continue to yield yourself you
[27:19] can do and will do because there's
[27:21] nothing there to stop you yet
[27:24] but listen folks but if the if it say if
[27:27] justification
[27:28] is a part of the new birth it is a part
[27:31] of the new birth and god knows whether
[27:33] you're going to make it you don't but if
[27:34] you persevere
[27:36] those who he has justified he's already
[27:38] glorified so in the mind of god but
[27:41] you've got to start at justification
[27:43] you got to start going to the water be
[27:45] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[27:46] christ confess your sins repent say god
[27:49] i'm sorry
[27:51] sorry for what i did and i'm going today
[27:54] i'm going to as many as sister ruth did
[27:56] and and sister regina a different one
[27:58] says this is my state this is what i'm
[28:00] putting down right here
[28:02] no more
[28:04] devil no more right here is where i'm
[28:06] putting this steak down when i go into
[28:08] this water i'm going to die
[28:10] when i come out i'm going to come in
[28:11] newness of life and god i want you to
[28:14] fill me with the holy ghost if i already
[28:16] got it fill me some more
[28:18] fill my cup lord
[28:20] let it run over
[28:22] that's what we got to look for folks we
[28:24] can't look for a trickle
[28:26] i don't want a trickle holy ghost
[28:34] i was thinking the other day
[28:36] i thought lord
[28:38] here i am out here with this
[28:40] watering can and
[28:42] i'm just
[28:44] y'all saw my garden if you look at
[28:46] what's that or on marco polo it's bigger
[28:48] than this room
[28:49] and i'm out there going
[28:55] and it's drying up about as quick as i
[28:56] go back over here
[28:59] i said lord just in about five minutes
[29:03] you can water this whole garden and give
[29:05] it everything it needs
[29:07] and i'm out here for two hours
[29:11] squirting a little water here and
[29:12] squirting a little and that little plant
[29:13] is going
[29:14] i need some more
[29:17] that's the kind of god we serve
[29:18] see that's that's why you say well i
[29:20] don't know if i don't want to bother him
[29:21] no he bother
[29:25] right him on his door
[29:27] thank god i need and we did we cried for
[29:29] rain a few weeks ago and got plenty of
[29:31] rain we cried for rain and it got rained
[29:33] again so thank god for the rain
[29:38] and my little corn plants they got their
[29:39] little things up just like this right
[29:41] here they were like this that's how we
[29:43] are as christians when we don't get
[29:44] water when we don't come to church when
[29:45] we don't read our bible guess what we
[29:47] become malnourished
[29:49] but boy when that rain comes you know
[29:51] what it does it turns those leaves up
[29:52] and you know what it does when it turns
[29:54] the leaves up that's the funnel that
[29:56] funnels it right down to the stalk
[29:58] and then it runs right down into the
[30:00] what a mighty god we serve
[30:02] funnels it right down to the roots to
[30:04] where it needs it it needs it in the
[30:06] roots
[30:07] and the root system and that's what menu
[30:08] i'm trying to get us to where we're
[30:10] rooted and grounded and settled to where
[30:12] we won't be shaking because you know
[30:14] what
[30:15] war is coming
[30:17] i talk about war physical war i'm
[30:18] talking about a spiritual war
[30:20] war is coming satan does not want us to
[30:22] get anywhere so he is going to what
[30:24] oppose everything we're doing
[30:27] but he cannot win
[30:30] we've we we've read the playbook
[30:33] and we've already won the battle he just
[30:36] don't know that
[30:37] so being justified freely by his grace
[30:40] through the redemption that is in christ
[30:41] jesus
[30:43] whom god has set forth to be of
[30:44] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[30:47] to declare his righteousness for the
[30:49] remission of sins that are past we
[30:52] cannot get forgiven for sins that we're
[30:54] going to do because we don't know what
[30:55] we've done
[30:57] or what we're going to do we do know
[30:58] what we've done
[31:00] you know today the things you've done
[31:02] that were wrong
[31:03] you didn't know him this morning
[31:06] how things changed we didn't know
[31:08] yesterday morning that was gonna lose
[31:09] toby but we did
[31:11] and that's okay
[31:13] but now in god
[31:15] you're supposed to get up and you say
[31:16] god whatever you got coming for me put
[31:19] the shield up
[31:21] but if i miss something then when we get
[31:24] to that spot i'm going to ask for
[31:26] forgiveness how can you ask for
[31:27] forgiveness for something you ain't done
[31:28] yet
[31:32] but you get re you get the there's
[31:34] righteousness for the remission of sins
[31:36] that are past
[31:37] and what does he do he is just in the
[31:39] justifiers we were reading there to what
[31:41] forgive you of that even now when we're
[31:44] up on the
[31:45] on the the top side of the mountain is
[31:47] as this uh song says we're looking up on
[31:50] that side of the mountain even with the
[31:51] baptism of the holy ghost we still have
[31:53] to say god forgive me and he is just to
[31:56] forgive us for the things that we're
[31:58] doing amen
[32:00] we just don't need to keep doing over
[32:02] and over and over again
[32:04] to declare i say that this time his
[32:06] righteousness
[32:08] not mine
[32:09] you can't get good enough to get saved
[32:12] you really need to get bad enough
[32:16] and realize you're bad
[32:18] that's what i come to i realized i was
[32:20] bad and i needed salvation because i
[32:23] didn't i didn't like going the direction
[32:24] i was going in
[32:26] but i didn't have that spiritual rudder
[32:27] to tell me
[32:28] and keep me what from the winds of war
[32:31] my war
[32:33] kids your war we all have a war
[32:36] pray for the holy ghost to give you that
[32:38] spiritual rudder to where if the winds
[32:39] start blowing in that direction but you
[32:41] need to go in that direction turn that
[32:42] rudder and say god i can't do it do it
[32:45] please do it for me
[32:46] and then what's he going to do the the
[32:48] big the big captain on top of the ship
[32:50] what's he going he's going hey turn the
[32:52] rider who's most important the captain
[32:54] or the guy the guy down there turning
[32:56] the rudder the guy down there turning
[32:58] the writer and that's what the holy
[32:59] ghost is giving for
[33:01] it's given to what to help us and we'll
[33:03] talk about it just for a second just in
[33:05] a second where's boasting then it's
[33:07] excluded by what law works there's no
[33:10] time we should boast about anything
[33:12] except what god's done for us
[33:14] nothing that we do
[33:15] therefore we conclude paul that a man is
[33:18] justified by faith without the deeds of
[33:21] the law the do's and the don'ts
[33:24] he said well now brother wave what are
[33:25] you talking about what about the dudes
[33:26] and the don'ts well under sanctification
[33:28] to me that's when uh but like brother
[33:31] brown said you become on in a religious
[33:33] order your name's put on a book you
[33:35] start your life starts changing not it's
[33:38] a new birth but it's sanctification when
[33:40] all that uncleanness starts going out of
[33:42] you
[33:43] when you say god i don't want to smoke
[33:45] anymore god i don't want to drink
[33:47] anymore i don't want to curse anymore i
[33:50] don't want to do this that or the other
[33:51] whatever you got your laundry list is
[33:53] the same as mine it just might have
[33:55] different list
[33:56] things listed on it because the bible
[33:58] says when the unclean spirit has gone
[34:00] out of a man he walketh through dry
[34:02] places seek his rest and find us none
[34:03] when he said i will return to my house
[34:06] satan says he's going to return to his
[34:08] house
[34:09] from whence he came out of he was
[34:10] comfortable
[34:12] we made devils comfortable that's why we
[34:14] don't get rid of them
[34:16] the prophet of god remember he
[34:19] he drove that spirit out of that woman
[34:21] and then later on brother he said
[34:23] brother brown they said brother brown
[34:24] that spirit came back on a woman you
[34:26] know what he said he said she liked it
[34:30] so she didn't just want it out she was
[34:32] opening the door saying
[34:34] get back in here
[34:36] i like you get back in here
[34:41] you got to get to where you hate a demon
[34:44] i mean you got to get to where you
[34:45] really hated demon
[34:46] when you hate a demon now he's going to
[34:48] hate you but when you hate a demon you
[34:50] give him the word of god he can't stand
[34:52] the word of god he can sit in a church
[34:54] he you can you can throw we can put this
[34:56] oil plus 55 gallon drum but when you're
[34:59] not ready to get rid of him he will not
[35:01] leave
[35:03] but when you're ready to get rid of him
[35:05] when you get sick and tired of being
[35:06] sick and tired and you don't want no
[35:07] more of it
[35:08] you want to change now that's us in the
[35:10] new birth also folks we got to come to a
[35:12] place to where daily were
[35:14] sanctified when the unclean spirit has
[35:17] gone out of a man walks through dry
[35:18] places seek rest finds none then he said
[35:20] i will return to my house from whence i
[35:22] came out and when he has come he findeth
[35:23] it empty
[35:24] swept and garnished
[35:26] then go ahead and take it with him seven
[35:27] other spirits more wicked than himself
[35:30] and they enter in and dwell there and
[35:31] the last state of that man is worse than
[35:32] the first
[35:34] wow
[35:35] even so shall it be into this wicked
[35:38] generation
[35:41] i was mentioning something the other day
[35:44] when
[35:46] we watched many times like i said before
[35:47] i looked in 2015 2016 and some of the
[35:50] people that we baptized and they're no
[35:52] longer here
[35:53] they're no longer serving the lord even
[35:55] they're just right back out in the world
[35:57] well you know what that it wasn't a
[35:59] waste of my time it wasn't a waste of
[36:01] god's time i believe it was a waste of
[36:03] their time
[36:06] because god was willing to save them i
[36:08] was willing to baptize them in the right
[36:09] way they were just were not willing to
[36:11] continue on with god
[36:13] because of the 17 or 18 that we baptized
[36:17] i'm sorry law of averages
[36:20] i hope they all get the holy ghost
[36:23] but i don't know
[36:25] two months from now
[36:27] well my cat's got diarrhea i don't know
[36:29] if i can make it to church tonight or
[36:30] not
[36:32] well my neighbor's tree fell on my
[36:34] garden and i think i better
[36:36] see when you start with excuses
[36:38] you go right back into the same junk you
[36:40] were in before
[36:42] please don't do that
[36:44] because you know what that's the devil
[36:45] doing that
[36:46] that's the devil putting that in front
[36:48] of you that's not god but now god's
[36:49] gonna let him tempt you to see whether
[36:51] you're a child of god now not that god
[36:54] will see but where you'll see whether
[36:55] you're a child of god or not so please
[36:57] don't please persevere i think about
[36:59] today listen this is a fight
[37:02] this is a battle i mean i'm talking
[37:04] about bloody noses i'm talking about
[37:06] blood running out your ears i'm talking
[37:08] about dirt in your face
[37:10] that's the battle that we're in
[37:12] and especially in the end time because
[37:14] satan has got his hold on the whole
[37:16] world except for me and you
[37:19] he's already got them so he's turned his
[37:21] guns all on us
[37:23] and he's going to what he's going to
[37:24] fight you in your mind
[37:27] because that's his playground
[37:29] nevertheless the foundation of god stand
[37:31] is sure
[37:32] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[37:34] that are his and let everyone that
[37:36] nameth the name of christ depart from
[37:38] iniquity what is iniquity it's a hideous
[37:40] sin it's knowing to do better and you do
[37:41] it anyway or knowing not to do it or
[37:44] knowing to do it and you don't do it
[37:46] but in the great house there are vessels
[37:48] of gold and silver and we'll talk about
[37:49] that in just a minute
[37:50] but also of wood and of earth and some
[37:52] to honor some to dishonor
[37:55] you know where they found a dead sea
[37:56] scroll where they find them in
[37:59] they found them in earth and vessels
[38:01] they found them in clay pots
[38:03] where you gonna find the word of god in
[38:04] the end time
[38:06] in clay pots
[38:08] we'll talk about that in a second
[38:10] questions and answers from genesis
[38:11] brother ryan said judas this carrot was
[38:13] justified by faith now we've already
[38:14] read this a bunch of times he was
[38:16] sanctified he was justified power to
[38:18] cast out devils
[38:20] they they healed the sick and they came
[38:22] back sanctified now sanctified none of
[38:25] them were filled with the holy ghost yet
[38:27] they just had an anointing they had that
[38:29] new spirit that that ezekiel's telling
[38:31] us about they got a new spirit they
[38:33] didn't get the spirit of god
[38:35] because god hadn't
[38:37] jesus hadn't died on a cross yet so
[38:38] there's no way he could transfer
[38:40] everything he had into them he just gave
[38:42] them power temporary power over those
[38:45] unclean spirits amen
[38:48] because with the baptism the holy ghost
[38:50] if you'll use it right you don't have
[38:52] temporary power you have power anytime
[38:54] you need it
[38:55] because the holy ghost is power
[38:58] all right and jesus said don't rejoice
[38:59] because the devil's a substitute but
[39:01] rejoice because your names are written
[39:02] in the book of heaven and judah says
[39:04] carrot was one of them called out
[39:06] sanctified in his name written in the
[39:08] lamb's book of life
[39:09] read matthew 10 and see if that's not
[39:11] right
[39:11] he called each one of the judas and
[39:13] everyone
[39:15] so we must be careful and not try to
[39:18] think that sanctification is our new
[39:20] birth we've been through this for years
[39:22] and years but please that's why i said
[39:23] don't settle down
[39:25] i got
[39:26] baptized no you get baptized you gotta
[39:29] start pushing you gotta start growing
[39:31] there was something planted that day
[39:35] you got planted in water
[39:37] but we come up in newness of life
[39:40] not death
[39:43] yeah we want everything that you don't
[39:44] want dead
[39:47] but not you
[39:49] we want a vessel of honor
[39:53] i'm glad jesus didn't throw the clay
[39:55] away aren't you
[39:57] a vessel of honor
[40:00] you're not tossed about by everything
[40:02] you know where you're standing
[40:04] there something happens
[40:06] you know that you're a real quick
[40:08] christian you know that you've been in
[40:09] contact with somebody that loves you
[40:11] and that's not filial love that's not
[40:13] just a little tickly
[40:14] in your heart that's knowing that god
[40:16] loves you but he loves you by corrective
[40:18] hands not by just i'm gonna shower you
[40:20] with everything
[40:22] hunky dory kumbaya and all that other
[40:24] stuff no
[40:26] it's a fight remember it's a battle and
[40:28] you've got to what
[40:30] jesus said if you'll draw nigh unto me
[40:33] i'll draw nigh unto you you've got to
[40:36] meet him somewhere all right
[40:39] you know that something happened down
[40:40] here and it's refreshing
[40:42] not only that but you'll refresh others
[40:44] you've seen people that was nice people
[40:46] but just couldn't hardly stand to be
[40:47] around them now he's talking about being
[40:49] a little creator now here's one i want
[40:50] to read real quick he said he'd give you
[40:52] a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's
[40:55] spirit so when you come under
[40:57] justification you've still got that old
[40:59] nature that you're fighting with you've
[41:02] just come out of the world and man is
[41:03] fresh on your mind and everything you
[41:06] did is right in front of you
[41:10] unless you moved
[41:13] but most of us most of us
[41:15] give our heart to god and we still live
[41:16] in the same place that we're living
[41:18] before as far as natural living right
[41:20] so all the things around you all the i
[41:22] had all the skull cans you know i had
[41:24] all the wild turkey and ginger ale and
[41:27] i'm just telling you the truth
[41:29] they were they were just like ornaments
[41:31] in my
[41:32] house i guess i'm the only one
[41:37] forgive me but i've been saved from them
[41:39] things
[41:40] hey man
[41:41] and you point you put yours up there and
[41:43] say i've been saved from that thing
[41:46] amen
[41:47] so i didn't and i didn't you know i some
[41:49] people put that stuff up and look at it
[41:51] and say well it don't tempt me no more i
[41:52] got rid of it
[41:54] get rid of that stuff
[41:56] don't ever tempt god or the devil
[41:59] you will lose on both points
[42:03] he'll give you a new spirit now that
[42:04] isn't god's spirit that's your spirit
[42:07] what's he doing he's he's cleaning your
[42:10] spirit up as brother brown said he said
[42:12] he said you know god
[42:14] he picks up this this dirty container
[42:17] out of the mud and he's it's all dirty
[42:19] and and what's the justification he he's
[42:22] justified in picking you up
[42:25] as we're going to see in just a minute
[42:26] god's justified when he takes that pound
[42:30] of clay
[42:32] still dirty
[42:34] still you're just changing the
[42:36] environment that it was in
[42:39] amen
[42:42] then you're going to clean it up
[42:45] but you're not going to drink out of it
[42:47] while it's got the mud still in it
[42:50] you got to clean it up you got to give
[42:52] it a new spirit what a clean spirit
[42:55] where you start going to church reading
[42:57] your bible come into bible study
[43:01] and when you don't do those things folks
[43:03] don't fool yourself
[43:05] you're not born again
[43:07] if that if that is see now look you say
[43:09] well you said everything was hard to do
[43:11] yeah it is hard to do but the overcoming
[43:13] part is when you get here
[43:16] amen you've overcome you've come here
[43:20] ask god to change something
[43:22] i'm asking god to change something now
[43:24] me
[43:26] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[43:28] out then he says i'll put my spirit in
[43:30] him but the thing god has to do is give
[43:33] you a new spirit make your nature a
[43:35] little more gentle and settle down
[43:38] or he couldn't even live with you
[43:41] wow
[43:43] so he has to get you fixed up first
[43:46] thank god for a fixer-upper
[43:50] so he can come in i'll give you a new
[43:52] spirit then you take him anywhere
[43:55] you go all kind of oh yeah brother wait
[43:57] i go back to the bars now no you can't
[44:01] because that's not where he's going
[44:05] you got to be led by the spirit of god
[44:06] led by the spirit of god is not going
[44:08] back to the beer joint
[44:09] led by the spirit of god comes church
[44:12] get in a circle of friends get in and
[44:15] get out of the ones that you were in
[44:17] you can't do that you can't there we go
[44:20] temp god now you can be a light and i
[44:22] know we have to live among the people
[44:23] but but you don't have to partake what
[44:25] you did before because they've got to
[44:28] see something different
[44:30] you're going to display what's inside of
[44:32] you i don't care what you do
[44:35] you're going to manifest what's inside
[44:36] of you
[44:37] he's got to get you fixed up
[44:39] so you can entertain him right tonight
[44:42] we want to entertain the holy ghost but
[44:45] our problem is is we got the devil that
[44:47] we're entertaining him too
[44:48] and he's got the joker thing on
[44:51] because he's going to fool you
[44:53] into thinking that it's god
[44:56] wow
[44:57] i felt good that was good but he he said
[45:00] the preacher that was good i felt good
[45:01] but he said something i didn't like and
[45:03] i ain't gonna do that
[45:05] okay
[45:11] disobedience is the first thing you
[45:12] better get over
[45:14] so that's when you're on the first altar
[45:16] but when you hide away you get his
[45:18] spirit that's what we're going to talk
[45:20] about in a minute then the holy spirit
[45:21] none other than god himself comes and
[45:23] dwells in you that's what we want
[45:26] we don't want just my old spirit or or
[45:29] another spirit that makes me feel better
[45:31] and do things right
[45:33] i want god's spirit that's what we're
[45:35] going to talk about in a few minutes
[45:36] it's not just the holy ghost it's the
[45:38] holy ghost and fire
[45:40] something's got to burn you out
[45:43] it's kind of we were talking about last
[45:44] sunday about baptismal
[45:48] you start with a cucumber
[45:51] when you put it in the or baptize it or
[45:53] baptizo dip baptizo and then baptismo
[45:57] when it goes into that whatever pickling
[45:59] agent vinegar and uh and the pickling
[46:02] salt
[46:03] it comes out of cucumber abby
[46:06] where's she at you just ate one a little
[46:08] bit ago but smell good but you know what
[46:09] it was once a cucumber
[46:11] it looked like a cucumber
[46:13] it acted like a cucumber
[46:16] it didn't smell like one because it
[46:17] smelled like white vinegar but it became
[46:20] a pickle
[46:21] and there's no way that pickle can be
[46:23] reversed back to a cucumber yet it still
[46:25] looks like a cucumber praise god
[46:29] that's what the holy ghost will do for
[46:30] you he'll change you and there's no way
[46:32] you can go back
[46:34] that's the problem we get to a certain
[46:36] place and then we won't go any further
[46:38] with god we won't we'll we'll go to that
[46:40] first part where he washes us up and
[46:43] gets the cucumber ready and you know and
[46:46] and then
[46:47] we stop
[46:49] we turn the oven off
[46:51] because you got to heat it up
[46:53] gotta put pressure
[46:55] a good pickle tea of good pickles
[46:58] pressurized
[46:59] parents likes pickles
[47:01] a good pickle though has got to go
[47:02] through a pressurized process you don't
[47:04] just lay it out there and go well i'm a
[47:06] pickle now no it goes through a process
[47:09] it's got to be heated up
[47:11] it's got to be changed
[47:13] from a cucumber to a pickle
[47:15] but it still looks the same
[47:17] we're just all a bunch of cucumbers
[47:20] until you get the holy ghost then when
[47:21] you get the holy ghost you're a pickle
[47:24] you look the same but you don't act the
[47:26] same until they definitely don't taste
[47:28] the same
[47:29] amen then the holy spirit none other
[47:32] than god himself comes and dwells in you
[47:34] and then there's something about you the
[47:36] neighbors love you the people likes you
[47:39] excuse me interval
[47:42] let's get on down here to the bottom now
[47:44] even you pentecostal people a lot of
[47:46] times just mistaken in that you get a
[47:48] new spirit that's not god's spirit
[47:49] that's you
[47:50] that isn't god you get a little happy
[47:52] because you get a new spirit you jump up
[47:54] and down you run around over the floor
[47:55] maybe or shout a little bit speak with
[47:58] tongues run around a little bit and
[47:59] think you got the holy ghost that's not
[48:01] it that's a new spirit god gave you
[48:03] that's you
[48:08] like what somebody said one time you
[48:10] know we talk about special meetings and
[48:12] we go we act different at special
[48:13] meetings
[48:15] we do because they're special
[48:17] there's special meetings we see people
[48:19] shout speak in tongues run around run
[48:21] out you know run all over the house and
[48:23] and have prayer lines and all these
[48:24] different things but the preacher was
[48:25] making a point he said but
[48:27] you ain't gonna do that every sunday
[48:32] every sunday though you come back to
[48:34] this meeting
[48:35] and this is a meeting where the shepherd
[48:37] and the sheep get to know each other
[48:40] and you do something wrong that shepherd
[48:42] is going to smack you upside the head
[48:44] he's not going to be out there and just
[48:45] ah it's a special meeting you know he
[48:47] said that's okay go to special meetings
[48:49] cause they're special
[48:50] but when you come back here he said you
[48:52] expect to hear from god he said you
[48:54] don't expect to hear from all that
[48:56] shouting and speaking in tongues and all
[48:57] that running around you need to hear
[48:58] from god
[48:59] amen in the quietness of the preaching
[49:03] by a pastor for his sheep
[49:07] that's a new spirit god give you that's
[49:09] you
[49:10] then after he gives you your spirit then
[49:11] he says i'll put my spirit
[49:13] that's what's a matter of this missed
[49:15] meal cramps
[49:17] that's what we're explaining and two
[49:19] that does mean that you've missed meals
[49:21] and that's what it is you go how many of
[49:22] you come to church remember if you come
[49:24] to church you either gonna get full
[49:27] or you're gonna have a missed meal cramp
[49:31] you're gonna either miss something or
[49:32] get something
[49:34] some of y'all look like you ain't got
[49:35] many you haven't missed many meals
[49:37] naturally
[49:39] but i want to be fat spiritually
[49:42] hey man
[49:43] i don't care about no diet plan in the
[49:44] spiritual realm
[49:46] i won't know this keto that i'm on now
[49:48] that i'm trying
[49:49] or this weight watchers i don't want
[49:50] none of that stuff i want to eat all i
[49:52] can when i'm in this building because
[49:54] these vitamins is what's important
[49:57] oh yeah bodily
[49:59] bodily exercise prophecies a little
[50:04] don't be sedentary get up and do
[50:06] something
[50:07] now notice you put a new spirit god has
[50:09] to give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[50:10] even get along with him because you know
[50:12] what you're doing you were alienated
[50:14] from god
[50:15] at your first birth
[50:17] you were alienated god you were not in
[50:19] the you now listen down here now in the
[50:21] mind of god you were but down here you
[50:23] were alienated from god you didn't have
[50:25] a clue what you were doing you got the
[50:27] things you did god was nowhere around
[50:31] oh yeah he was around but he was up here
[50:32] looking down at you
[50:34] or over in another dimension going come
[50:36] on
[50:37] come on
[50:38] come on you got to get through that one
[50:39] come on you missed that one you got to
[50:40] go back come on come on but you're down
[50:42] here struggling like you wouldn't
[50:43] believe
[50:45] but god knows what he's doing
[50:48] so he gives you a spirit to get along
[50:50] with he takes that spirit out of you and
[50:52] gives you a spirit to get along with him
[50:54] get along with yourself to begin with
[50:57] didn't we hate ourself in the world
[51:00] come on just
[51:02] i hated myself i got to a place where i
[51:05] just hated being me
[51:08] and
[51:08] most people that was around me did too
[51:12] praise the lord anyhow
[51:15] but what happened
[51:16] god justified me you've heard my story i
[51:19] got justified and sanctified i got
[51:21] cleaned up got water baptized felt just
[51:25] a freshness come over me and felt an
[51:27] emptiness where everything emptied out
[51:29] but you know what
[51:31] i didn't
[51:32] disappear from church
[51:34] i didn't quit reading my bible i didn't
[51:37] quit studying i didn't quit coming
[51:39] around you guys
[51:42] i knew that was part of my journey but
[51:44] not the complete journey
[51:46] i had to get around some good
[51:48] sheep not some black sheep or some ghost
[51:53] they say but
[51:58] and i know you did too you move forward
[52:00] into that next realm you've moved over
[52:02] into that sanctified place and it was
[52:04] all new it was all beautiful
[52:07] you heard from god
[52:09] but you can't stay there
[52:10] you got to keep moving
[52:12] you got to keep going
[52:14] i've seen people and you i don't have
[52:18] god knows i don't have any discernment
[52:19] but you can watch people and see kind of
[52:21] where they're at you know there's people
[52:23] it's just like like the children of
[52:24] israel they're going around horrible and
[52:26] they just continued you know about every
[52:30] from 40 years to every two years they
[52:32] looped that mountain they looked down
[52:33] and they said well that's my footprint
[52:36] i've been here before
[52:38] they were on an indian death march
[52:40] that's the way we were on an indian
[52:42] death march just around and around but
[52:44] one day god said stop
[52:49] i've had enough of this you either going
[52:51] to go north you're either going to go
[52:53] and possess that land or i'm going to
[52:55] give it to somebody else

[59:18] didn't let you go
[59:20] right
[59:21] boys don't do that anymore brother boy
[59:22] he's delivered from that but there was a
[59:24] point in time in our journey that we
[59:26] knew that he was
[59:27] a little bit on the temperamental side
[59:29] so but you know what god will sell you
[59:30] there want him he'll give you a red
[59:32] headed wife being born again
[59:36] not of corruptible seed but of
[59:38] incorruptible
[59:39] by the word of god god will give you
[59:41] something to straighten you out if
[59:42] you're a child of god i promise you
[59:45] what did moses moses was the meekest man
[59:47] in the world zappora was not
[59:51] okay
[59:53] but you see how this look and i'm making
[59:56] a funny joke but this is all life it's
[59:58] the life that we're living it's the true
[1:00:00] life that we're living it's not some
[1:00:02] it's not something painted up you know
[1:00:04] it's not somewhat bob ross
[1:00:07] nice
[1:00:09] trees
[1:00:12] and we're gonna draw mountains
[1:00:15] and now we're going to draw flowers
[1:00:18] it's not that this is not a flowery bed
[1:00:20] of ease
[1:00:21] this is a battle
[1:00:23] you got to turn that brushstroke into a
[1:00:25] pistol or a sword something
[1:00:30] honestly folks
[1:00:32] me included we're not fighting as much
[1:00:34] as we should
[1:00:36] we are not fighting and using remember
[1:00:38] the warfare
[1:00:40] it's not of the guns that we haven't
[1:00:42] it's the word of god
[1:00:44] versus satan
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] and where's god if he's in you you're
[1:00:50] doing the fighting he's doing the
[1:00:51] fighting through you if the devil's in
[1:00:52] you he's doing the fighting through you
[1:00:54] all right but this now let's talk about
[1:00:56] this being born again not a corruptible
[1:00:58] seed but of incorruptible
[1:01:00] by the word of god so the only way you
[1:01:02] can get born again is what by the word
[1:01:04] of god
[1:01:05] not by your mama not by your daddy not
[1:01:08] by listening to a good preacher
[1:01:10] that helps
[1:01:12] but by the word of god let it sink down
[1:01:14] inside of you
[1:01:16] see that's when i realized i had the new
[1:01:17] birth is it was not something
[1:01:20] external
[1:01:22] it was something internal
[1:01:24] because we're going to read here in a
[1:01:25] minute where the bible even tells us
[1:01:26] that you don't need a teacher anymore
[1:01:27] the teacher's inside of you now listen
[1:01:29] i'm going to tell you like the prophet
[1:01:30] god said he said
[1:01:32] that don't mean you sit at home and get
[1:01:33] all that by yourself
[1:01:35] no he give us teachers in the body to
[1:01:37] what to coincide with that teacher
[1:01:40] that's inside of you
[1:01:42] if you don't have the teacher inside of
[1:01:44] you there's nothing to connect to
[1:01:47] you will not understand a word i'm
[1:01:49] saying tonight without the holy ghost or
[1:01:51] the quickening power that heads you
[1:01:53] toward the holy ghost if you're in your
[1:01:55] journey praise god
[1:01:57] realize though that it's a journey and
[1:01:59] you've got to this point that you're
[1:02:01] trying to get to this point and god help
[1:02:03] us to find out where we are and help us
[1:02:06] to find out how much we can get further
[1:02:12] because listen
[1:02:14] in the mind of god
[1:02:17] he had an
[1:02:18] image and he was going to make sure that
[1:02:21] image come to pass
[1:02:23] and what was that image
[1:02:25] it had to start as a spiritual image
[1:02:26] first
[1:02:28] genesis 1 26
[1:02:31] let us make man in our own image after
[1:02:34] our own likeness
[1:02:36] let them have dominion over the what the
[1:02:37] fish of the sea flesh
[1:02:41] you say anything about angels
[1:02:43] you ever thought about that
[1:02:45] give him dominion over the fish of the
[1:02:47] sea and defile the air and every living
[1:02:49] creature that's on the face of the earth
[1:02:51] god give this person dominion
[1:02:54] put him in a spiritual form first
[1:02:58] and then he created the physical form
[1:02:59] and he said you are over this group
[1:03:01] right here
[1:03:03] then god said okay
[1:03:10] i got this lump of clay
[1:03:12] and i'm going to put it on the wheel
[1:03:16] and i'm gonna work on it
[1:03:19] as a prophet god tells us that there
[1:03:21] stood adam in the garden of eden
[1:03:23] in genesis 2 7 he's getting ready to put
[1:03:25] that spiritual man
[1:03:27] inside of an earthen vessel
[1:03:29] inside of a pot
[1:03:31] called adam
[1:03:33] adam physical
[1:03:35] everybody with me
[1:03:37] and here as as the prophet of god
[1:03:39] illustrates it looks like adam is
[1:03:40] standing in the garden of eden and his
[1:03:42] toes are like roots of a tree
[1:03:45] because that's where he came from
[1:03:47] the potter takes the clay listen the
[1:03:49] potter has to go down to the earth
[1:03:52] to get the clay
[1:03:54] the clay's not in the air
[1:03:57] the clay's on the ground
[1:03:59] the clay's on the earth
[1:04:01] and he picked up a special pot of cla
[1:04:04] thing clay hey you know what
[1:04:06] clay
[1:04:08] threw it on the wheel
[1:04:11] he said all right
[1:04:16] breath of eternal life
[1:04:19] that thing's now living
[1:04:21] but i made it
[1:04:24] it's living but i made it
[1:04:27] i'm the creator
[1:04:28] i'm the one that'll make it
[1:04:30] and then i'm gonna put my life inside of
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:34] but i'm not gonna be finished with that
[1:04:36] i want them to bring forth little pots
[1:04:41] and more little pots and the pots that
[1:04:43] you that they make
[1:04:45] i'm gonna
[1:04:46] give them life
[1:04:48] and then i'm gonna give them a chance or
[1:04:50] an opportunity to become eternal
[1:04:54] everybody with me here
[1:04:56] bible says right here all flesh is grass
[1:04:58] it's just there i mean it's just there
[1:05:00] flesh
[1:05:01] and all the glory of man is the flower
[1:05:03] of grass the grass with us and a flower
[1:05:05] therefore falleth away but the word of
[1:05:06] the lord endureth forever
[1:05:09] this is the word which the gospel is
[1:05:10] preached unto you they found those dead
[1:05:12] sea scrolls
[1:05:14] in caves
[1:05:15] in pots
[1:05:17] they were preserved for thousands of
[1:05:20] years in earth and vessels
[1:05:22] and that's what god wanted in the
[1:05:25] beginning until that got marred
[1:05:28] by eve his second pot
[1:05:36] got marty we had to come the way we are
[1:05:38] now
[1:05:40] but you know what
[1:05:41] he's a master potter
[1:05:44] he puts the clay on the wheel
[1:05:48] he spins the wheel
[1:05:50] he uses water
[1:05:54] and you know what you got to do i've
[1:05:56] watched many times we grew up working
[1:05:58] there's a pottery place right across the
[1:05:59] road probably you've seen it cravings
[1:06:00] pottery it was world famous at one time
[1:06:03] huge 20 some million dollar company
[1:06:05] and they made they made tractor trailer
[1:06:07] loads of pots by the day
[1:06:09] you know what it all started from if you
[1:06:11] go out and look now you can see still a
[1:06:13] pile of it it's the ugliest mountain you
[1:06:15] ever see in your life because it's been
[1:06:16] rained on it's been it's collapsed it's
[1:06:18] turned colors
[1:06:20] that's what happens when you don't have
[1:06:21] god
[1:06:22] as a master potter
[1:06:25] that master parter though what does he
[1:06:26] do he takes that clay what happened with
[1:06:28] that one out the physical part of that
[1:06:31] that clay is what it's needed
[1:06:34] it's getting all the impurities out but
[1:06:36] it comes to a tube about this big and
[1:06:37] what happens is if you've got a one
[1:06:39] gallon jar or two gallon jars that
[1:06:41] somebody sits and cuts them off
[1:06:43] well this one is made for a specific
[1:06:45] thing but listen to what happens
[1:06:49] it's got to be soft
[1:06:51] so it can be molded
[1:06:52] like i said before god has to give you a
[1:06:54] new spirit
[1:06:56] so that you can get along with the
[1:06:57] potter
[1:06:59] because you know what you can't say to
[1:07:01] the potter why'd you make me this way
[1:07:04] remember the bible
[1:07:05] you got to be molded and you're going to
[1:07:07] be listen we're all molded in his image
[1:07:12] adolf hitler was molded in his image
[1:07:15] but there was something put down inside
[1:07:17] of adolf hitler called a soul to make a
[1:07:19] choice
[1:07:20] and he made a horrible choice
[1:07:23] but god just continued to let that
[1:07:25] vessel go
[1:07:26] and it'll get its reward but they have
[1:07:28] special pots
[1:07:29] their special
[1:07:31] special clay the kind that he has to go
[1:07:34] and get and pick up and put on the wheel
[1:07:37] and then spin the wheel
[1:07:40] and let me tell you something i've been
[1:07:42] and worked for a year or two over that
[1:07:45] cravings pottery and it's the messiest
[1:07:47] place you'll ever see
[1:07:50] but it starts out a real nice pretty
[1:07:51] clean piece of piece of clay
[1:07:53] but he puts it on that wheel and most of
[1:07:55] them when you put on the wheel you got
[1:07:56] to smack it down on the wheel
[1:07:58] because you don't want it to move
[1:08:00] you want it to be perfectly straight
[1:08:02] where you when the hands go like this
[1:08:04] it's not wobbling or your pot is going
[1:08:05] to look like this
[1:08:07] but put it in there and guess what's the
[1:08:09] first thing they do
[1:08:12] they take water
[1:08:14] there's always water right here
[1:08:17] there's always water
[1:08:19] and he takes the water
[1:08:21] he splashes it on the
[1:08:23] on the um
[1:08:25] clay and it becomes wet
[1:08:28] and those beautiful hands
[1:08:30] that was making that pot
[1:08:33] has now become as dirty as the pot
[1:08:38] god had to come down here
[1:08:40] he had to come down here and get dirty
[1:08:42] with us
[1:08:44] because god made a body on a wheel one
[1:08:46] time
[1:08:46] it's called jesus christ 2000 years ago
[1:08:48] and he came here as a baby
[1:08:50] but he had to get his hands dirty
[1:08:52] and every time he deals with me and you
[1:08:54] know what he does he gets his hands
[1:08:55] dirty
[1:08:56] and then old dirty hands oh my my cousin
[1:08:58] and and joe craven and all them they'd
[1:09:00] have mud all the way to here and they
[1:09:01] would actually wear an apron because it
[1:09:03] just swings everywhere
[1:09:05] so whatever came out of the clean part
[1:09:06] is not clean anymore
[1:09:08] but what's he doing he has got something
[1:09:10] in his mind that he's going to make
[1:09:14] whether it be a one pound jar strawberry
[1:09:15] jar whatever it is and all the things on
[1:09:17] the outside all the markings that he's
[1:09:19] going to mark on the outside
[1:09:23] but you know what he's got to do
[1:09:26] when he turns that wheel
[1:09:29] his hands get dirty
[1:09:31] but what's the first thing he does to
[1:09:34] make a pot you got to put your hand down
[1:09:36] in it
[1:09:38] first thing he does is he takes his hand
[1:09:40] and he pushes
[1:09:41] puts a little pressure on the pot
[1:09:44] everybody with me
[1:09:46] he puts a little pressure on the pot
[1:09:48] and what's the first thing he does he
[1:09:49] reaches and gets it like this and he
[1:09:51] starts up the wall
[1:09:55] and if it is an impurity guess what he
[1:09:57] stops
[1:09:58] he doesn't go get another piece of clay
[1:10:01] he uses that piece of clay
[1:10:03] he smashes it back down
[1:10:05] with the trials and tribulations that we
[1:10:07] have remember if we
[1:10:08] if we don't pass the test what do we do
[1:10:10] we take it again
[1:10:12] so he matches it back down because
[1:10:14] remember it's still pliable
[1:10:16] it's water it it's still something that
[1:10:18] god can work with
[1:10:20] it's still something that he can use
[1:10:22] he's still got it in his mind what he's
[1:10:24] going to use they had to have in their
[1:10:26] mind a strawberry jar a one pound jar or
[1:10:29] a jar with a handle and drive without a
[1:10:30] handle that's the master potter he knew
[1:10:34] and he knew how high to make it because
[1:10:35] he had a what he had a
[1:10:37] a guide
[1:10:41] he had a comforter
[1:10:43] he had a guide
[1:10:44] and they literally they did it was a
[1:10:46] stick and you turned the thing and you
[1:10:47] moved it down and had a little pen
[1:10:49] sticking out and that's how you made
[1:10:51] that certain pot and you'd make it that
[1:10:52] pot up to that side and make a lip to it
[1:10:54] and it would be perfect just what you
[1:10:56] needed but god had i mean the potter had
[1:10:58] to first do is stick his hand down in
[1:11:00] that pot
[1:11:03] and get it clean
[1:11:06] he had to get it clean and here he goes
[1:11:09] still
[1:11:10] forming to the lip and it's still
[1:11:13] spinning the whole time
[1:11:14] we think our life is spinning out of
[1:11:16] control
[1:11:18] let's try to think that's god molding us
[1:11:21] if it's spinning that's all right let it
[1:11:23] spin listen if you're of gods it will
[1:11:25] not go off that that wheel
[1:11:28] it'll stay there because when they get
[1:11:30] ready to put that pot somewhere else
[1:11:31] they have to literally take a a like a
[1:11:34] fishing line pull it as tight as they
[1:11:36] can and they do this right here
[1:11:38] underneath it to cut it off of that
[1:11:39] wheel
[1:11:40] when god's finished with you he'll cut
[1:11:42] the will he'll know what to do and he'll
[1:11:44] put your pot over there to use
[1:11:46] everybody with me
[1:11:48] but we have to go what we have to go
[1:11:50] through
[1:11:52] a process
[1:11:55] we have to go through
[1:11:59] a drying process
[1:12:02] the unclean spirit's gone out
[1:12:05] god's justified us by using that piece
[1:12:06] of clay he's sanctifying us because he's
[1:12:09] what he's cleaning us up getting us
[1:12:10] ready to put it in service because that
[1:12:13] jar has got to be at a certain
[1:12:15] um
[1:12:16] moisture content before he puts it in
[1:12:18] the fire
[1:12:19] if it's too low it won't kill if it's
[1:12:21] too high
[1:12:22] it'll blow up
[1:12:25] but what's the next thing god does
[1:12:28] he takes fire
[1:12:30] i mean the potter sorry the potter
[1:12:33] knows there's an oven right over there
[1:12:36] that's what i used to do i used to fill
[1:12:38] it full and but now remember when you
[1:12:40] did that when you got that when you got
[1:12:42] a new spirit you had to be careful
[1:12:44] because you could still bust the pot
[1:12:46] everybody with me that's all right
[1:12:49] on wednesday night
[1:12:50] okay
[1:12:53] it's still pliable but it's drying
[1:12:55] the unclean spirit's gone out
[1:13:01] it's being moved to a new area
[1:13:04] it's being moved closer to the fire
[1:13:08] but now once that pot is taken and put
[1:13:11] in that kill okay i only killed
[1:13:14] it's heated to like 1500 degrees
[1:13:17] you stack them here and you stack them
[1:13:19] oh we used to stack that thing
[1:13:20] completely full then we would put fire
[1:13:23] bricks on the outside and it up
[1:13:25] with
[1:13:26] clay
[1:13:28] to keep the fire from coming out
[1:13:30] but when we got finished
[1:13:33] what do we have
[1:13:35] a vessel of honor
[1:13:38] because jesus didn't throw that part of
[1:13:40] the clay away
[1:13:41] he put it in a kill
[1:13:43] he baptized it with the holy ghost and
[1:13:46] fire
[1:13:47] and now guess what
[1:13:49] you're not pliable anymore
[1:13:53] you're a hardened christian
[1:13:55] now you got a soft heart
[1:13:57] but they'll never be able to make that
[1:13:59] cucumber i mean that pickle of cucumber
[1:14:01] again you'll never be able to make that
[1:14:03] pot
[1:14:04] when you drive by there and you look you
[1:14:06] drive by cravings party you look you see
[1:14:08] all that all those pots they turn red
[1:14:12] somebody say it man they turn red when
[1:14:15] they get to the fire
[1:14:17] because when you put them in there
[1:14:18] they're flesh-colored
[1:14:21] everybody with me
[1:14:22] but when you put them in that kill they
[1:14:24] turn an orange red so you know they're
[1:14:26] finished because when you look out in
[1:14:27] that parking lot you can see that that's
[1:14:29] a finished product
[1:14:32] and you can see that it's what getting
[1:14:34] ready
[1:14:35] to be bought with a price
[1:14:39] and then to be put in use not going to
[1:14:41] sit out there all the time somebody's
[1:14:43] going to use that
[1:14:45] that's the same way with us being
[1:14:46] predestinated look after you heard the
[1:14:49] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:14:50] salvation after you believed after
[1:14:54] after you were molded
[1:14:56] after you had the water after you had
[1:14:59] god cut you off of the wheel and put you
[1:15:01] over in a place closer to the fire to
[1:15:03] get you what to get you ready to receive
[1:15:05] him
[1:15:08] everybody with me which is the earnest
[1:15:10] of your inheritance when i put that pot
[1:15:12] in there that was an earnest
[1:15:15] that pot didn't get put in use inside
[1:15:17] that kill
[1:15:20] you can barely listen i think my tennis
[1:15:22] shoes i think i wore 20 pair that
[1:15:26] summer you walk in there and they just
[1:15:28] melt
[1:15:29] so we had to wait we had to have those
[1:15:31] fire gloves but when we brought them
[1:15:32] things out and put them out and let them
[1:15:34] cool
[1:15:35] let the coolness of the holy spirit blow
[1:15:38] over that vessel
[1:15:40] he's going to say use me lord
[1:15:42] use me lord i'm i've turned red now
[1:15:47] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:15:48] i've turned red in your blood
[1:15:50] i'm accepting you lord and now whatever
[1:15:53] you got for me i may be shipped to
[1:15:57] xyz
[1:15:58] but i'm going to be used i can't be used
[1:16:01] as a lump
[1:16:03] i've got to be put on the potter's wheel
[1:16:05] and god you got you got to get your
[1:16:07] hands dirty with me
[1:16:12] that's what he did
[1:16:17] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:16:19] into what
[1:16:20] the redemption of the purchased
[1:16:21] possession
[1:16:23] to the praise of his glory
[1:16:25] i want that pot right there
[1:16:27] that's a good looking pot
[1:16:30] that pot's been through the fire
[1:16:32] that pot's been through the potter's
[1:16:33] wheel and i know there's a potter behind
[1:16:35] that that got his hands dirty
[1:16:37] i know there's a potter that's slaved
[1:16:39] that probably spent hours
[1:16:42] making that whole pallet
[1:16:44] of vessels of honor
[1:16:47] i am today
[1:16:48] aren't you glad jesus didn't throw the
[1:16:50] clay away
[1:16:52] i am so glad
[1:16:54] john 14 15 says if you love me keep my
[1:16:56] commandments
[1:16:57] and i will pray the father and he shall
[1:16:59] give you another comforter that he may
[1:17:00] abide with you forever
[1:17:02] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:17:04] look the world cannot receive this holy
[1:17:06] ghost
[1:17:08] i'm talking about the world general
[1:17:11] i was thinking about it yesterday
[1:17:14] you know you can quote charles stanley
[1:17:18] you can quote jensen franklin which is
[1:17:20] right up here
[1:17:22] you can quote
[1:17:24] jim baker what everything he done they
[1:17:26] still put him up on a pedestal you can
[1:17:28] quote jim baker
[1:17:30] god forbid tammy baker
[1:17:33] but you can quote all these people john
[1:17:35] hagee john hagee's a good man
[1:17:38] john mccarthy he's a good man he's a
[1:17:40] good he's nominal preacher good guy
[1:17:43] and whatever that one in texas is i
[1:17:44] can't remember his name the big guy
[1:17:47] but anyway these are these are guys that
[1:17:49] they they quote like uh well max locato
[1:17:53] uh and and all the different ones
[1:17:55] alistair begg all that
[1:17:56] you hear those quotes and you hear them
[1:17:58] quoting things all the time but you say
[1:18:00] william branham said
[1:18:06] what do you mean
[1:18:08] y'all still read his messages
[1:18:11] 60 years and quote his message after
[1:18:14] he's already been dead
[1:18:16] i say yeah you do the same thing
[1:18:20] billy graham's been gone almost that
[1:18:22] long
[1:18:24] or roberts has gone almost that long and
[1:18:26] you're still quoting him
[1:18:28] the problem is
[1:18:31] it's just like that quote i read you
[1:18:34] we want a prophet
[1:18:37] but we're going to kill him and put him
[1:18:38] in a tomb because we don't like what he
[1:18:39] said
[1:18:41] because he came a different way
[1:18:43] he was a different looking pot
[1:18:46] god made that pot now listen god made
[1:18:48] these brothers too i'm not saying
[1:18:50] anything against them but why can we get
[1:18:52] why we get ostracized because we can
[1:18:54] quote william branham we can quote a
[1:18:55] preacher from the past and everybody
[1:18:58] else quoted each preacher from the past
[1:18:59] and it's okay
[1:19:02] it's the spirit behind it
[1:19:05] he was different he brought us the truth
[1:19:08] of water baptism the truth of no eternal
[1:19:11] hell the truth of all these different
[1:19:13] things the true way to get the baptism
[1:19:15] of the holy ghost
[1:19:16] he brought those things to me and you
[1:19:18] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[1:19:21] behold i'm going to put that pi i'm the
[1:19:23] potter i'm going to put that special
[1:19:24] clay on there
[1:19:26] and instead of just molding him i'm
[1:19:28] going to make a whole truckload of them
[1:19:31] little messiahs
[1:19:36] the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:19:37] cannot receive the world can't receive
[1:19:39] truth
[1:19:40] well hey listen
[1:19:43] the best read magazines are those that
[1:19:44] says that there's an alien came down and
[1:19:46] had a baby with a woman and and they had
[1:19:48] kittens
[1:19:54] jonathan don't look at me like that
[1:19:55] you've been standing in line with some
[1:19:56] encounters who looked at the national
[1:19:57] enquirer
[1:19:59] and you're looking it but the whole
[1:20:01] world says oh that's that's to be the
[1:20:03] truth
[1:20:05] and you tell the word of god and they go
[1:20:06] now no don't give me any of that why
[1:20:09] they don't have the right spirit
[1:20:12] they haven't been through justification
[1:20:14] and sanctification like you should go
[1:20:16] through
[1:20:17] and the baptism of the holy ghost god
[1:20:18] wants to put you and me in
[1:20:20] into a
[1:20:23] listen we're not above the world
[1:20:27] we are not special people only that god
[1:20:30] made us special people
[1:20:32] you and i are all come from the same
[1:20:35] place
[1:20:36] but by receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:20:38] ghost though that makes you different
[1:20:42] by making a choice that makes you
[1:20:44] different
[1:20:47] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:20:49] come to you
[1:20:51] yet why in the world will see me no more
[1:20:53] but you'll see me how many of you have
[1:20:55] ever seen jesus in the flesh
[1:21:00] on folks i'm looking at him
[1:21:03] and the word was made flesh
[1:21:05] your flesh
[1:21:07] your vessel
[1:21:09] your pot of clay that you think man this
[1:21:10] thing is just awful i'm all bent all
[1:21:12] over and and i can't hold much
[1:21:15] water but you're a vessel of honor
[1:21:19] because god's the one that made you
[1:21:21] now we got to give something back to the
[1:21:23] potter
[1:21:24] yet a little while the world sees many
[1:21:26] more but you'll see me because what i
[1:21:28] live you shall live also
[1:21:30] at that day the prophet of god said this
[1:21:32] day
[1:21:33] you shall know that i am in the father
[1:21:35] and ye and me and i and you
[1:21:37] that's why there's not two or three gods
[1:21:38] running around and even with us involved
[1:21:40] it's not two or three gods running
[1:21:41] around one god
[1:21:43] one god inside of me and you
[1:21:46] these things have i spoken unto you
[1:21:47] being yet present with you but the
[1:21:48] comforter
[1:21:50] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[1:21:51] will send in my name he shall teach you
[1:21:54] all things and bring all things to your
[1:21:57] remembrance whatsoever
[1:21:59] i have said
[1:22:00] unto you
[1:22:02] how many times have you been sitting and
[1:22:04] thinking on god or or or have an issue
[1:22:07] that you're working through and you come
[1:22:09] in here and you sit down and and you
[1:22:11] swear that the the preacher was with you
[1:22:13] the whole week
[1:22:18] that wasn't you
[1:22:20] that wasn't the preacher
[1:22:22] that was the holy ghost the one the
[1:22:23] spirit of truth that was with you
[1:22:28] he said he wouldn't abide
[1:22:30] with you he'd abide in you
[1:22:33] so what you look at he looks at oh come
[1:22:35] on now hold on a minute brother wait
[1:22:37] yeah
[1:22:40] what he looks at we look at
[1:22:43] what he what you say
[1:22:45] we better be careful
[1:22:48] let's read this real quick and then
[1:22:49] we'll close
[1:22:50] and john bear record saying i saw the
[1:22:51] spirit descending from heaven like a
[1:22:53] dove now this who is coming to abide on
[1:22:56] jesus now we know that jesus was the
[1:22:57] word we know that jesus didn't need the
[1:22:59] holy ghost
[1:23:00] he was the holy ghost the the spirit
[1:23:03] inside of him was the holy ghost he
[1:23:04] didn't need he didn't walk as many have
[1:23:07] said he didn't walk 30 years as a mortal
[1:23:10] man yes he did walk 30 years as a mortal
[1:23:12] man but he was god
[1:23:14] he was different than me and you he was
[1:23:16] not born in sin he didn't have a carnal
[1:23:18] mind his spirit wasn't all messed up
[1:23:21] sure the devil tried to get to him many
[1:23:22] times but he never defeated him
[1:23:26] that's right
[1:23:30] but now john you're a prophet this is
[1:23:32] john the baptist now john you're a
[1:23:34] prophet
[1:23:36] maybe he's sitting on a rock one day and
[1:23:38] he's got his head down and thank god
[1:23:40] he's dipping them locust and that pure
[1:23:42] honey
[1:23:43] man that'll make that'll make anything
[1:23:45] taste good
[1:23:49] being a beekeeper i should know that
[1:23:52] but he's dipping that locust and wild
[1:23:54] honey and he's eating it and
[1:23:55] he's fixing up his camel hair and
[1:23:59] he's getting ready to go out and
[1:24:01] god speaks to him and says hey i know
[1:24:03] you're a prophet
[1:24:04] i know you can see spirits
[1:24:06] you can see things ascending and
[1:24:08] descending because watch remember he's
[1:24:09] standing in the water and he's looking
[1:24:10] he sees two or three men walk by which
[1:24:13] are from the temple
[1:24:15] he says hey you generation of vipers
[1:24:22] ax is going to be laid in the room of
[1:24:23] your tree you don't even have the right
[1:24:25] kind of father what are you doing what
[1:24:27] was that discernment he saw the spirit
[1:24:29] of god with us descend on caiaphas
[1:24:31] caiaphas would go behind the curtain and
[1:24:33] he would offer
[1:24:34] the um
[1:24:35] the blood for the year and come back out
[1:24:37] and say all is well and inside of him
[1:24:39] he's black as black can be
[1:24:42] because he put jesus on a cross
[1:24:45] so john
[1:24:48] bear record saying i saw the spirit
[1:24:49] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:24:51] it abode on him who jesus
[1:24:53] and i knew him not but he that sent me
[1:24:56] to baptize with water
[1:24:57] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[1:25:00] shalt see the spirit descend
[1:25:02] and remain
[1:25:07] different kind of guy
[1:25:10] he wasn't an anointed one
[1:25:14] because an anointed one you can have the
[1:25:17] spirit of god on your flesh and on your
[1:25:19] spirit every day of your life and you
[1:25:20] can die go to hell be just as black
[1:25:22] inside as you ever have been that's
[1:25:23] exactly the way kaipas was but god
[1:25:26] specifically told john said look i know
[1:25:28] you're watching in the spirit realm
[1:25:30] but when you see that spirit come down
[1:25:32] and go on somebody and stay there with
[1:25:34] him and remain that dub just didn't
[1:25:36] light on his shoulder
[1:25:40] it disappeared
[1:25:43] because it went inside of him
[1:25:46] and remaining on him the same as he
[1:25:49] which baptizes
[1:25:50] with the holy ghost or baptismal
[1:25:53] changed the
[1:25:55] cucumber into the pickle
[1:25:58] john 7 37 says in the last day that
[1:26:00] great day of the feast jesus stood and
[1:26:01] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[1:26:03] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[1:26:05] on me is the scripture that saith out of
[1:26:07] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:26:09] water but this spake he of the spirit
[1:26:11] which they that believe on him should
[1:26:13] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[1:26:15] given
[1:26:17] sometimes we don't quote that scripture
[1:26:19] the holy ghost was not given the woman
[1:26:22] at the well didn't get the baptism of
[1:26:23] the holy ghost the new birth
[1:26:28] mary didn't get the new birth until the
[1:26:30] upper room and neither did elizabeth
[1:26:32] neither did john
[1:26:33] they got the holy ghost they got an
[1:26:35] anointing
[1:26:37] because the holy ghost had not been
[1:26:38] released yet there stood jesus with the
[1:26:41] holy ghost
[1:26:42] he said i can't give it to you now but
[1:26:44] i'm going to go away and then i'll come
[1:26:46] back
[1:26:47] and when i come back that's what i'm
[1:26:49] going to do i'm not just going to come
[1:26:50] inside of you i'm going to remain and
[1:26:52] i'm going to
[1:26:54] burn out
[1:26:56] everything
[1:26:57] all the impurities
[1:26:59] not one speck of you
[1:27:01] it's going to be wet
[1:27:04] i'm going to dry you out
[1:27:07] but i'm going to put inside of you
[1:27:08] something
[1:27:10] that out of your belly
[1:27:13] will flow rivers
[1:27:15] of living water
[1:27:16] your belly
[1:27:19] i just read you that we're joined heirs
[1:27:20] with god
[1:27:22] if he if out of his belly flowed rivers
[1:27:24] of living water same way with us what
[1:27:26] are we doing now we are preaching the
[1:27:28] word of god we're receiving the word of
[1:27:30] god and what is it it's a river that's
[1:27:32] flowing out
[1:27:33] there's a river of life
[1:27:35] flowing out from me what makes the lame
[1:27:38] to walk and the blind to see
[1:27:41] open prison doors set the captive free
[1:27:45] there's a river of life flowing out of
[1:27:47] me
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:52] let's read this right here
[1:27:54] but you shall receive power that word
[1:27:57] power is dunamis like dynamite you've
[1:28:00] heard brother
[1:28:01] god bless his soul brother ernie
[1:28:03] villanueva has gone on to be with the
[1:28:04] lord but every time he preached he would
[1:28:07] use that word dunamis
[1:28:08] because listen there with the holy ghost
[1:28:11] everywhere you see the holy ghost it
[1:28:12] says power
[1:28:14] but you shall receive power after that
[1:28:16] the holy ghost you're not listen you're
[1:28:18] powerless without him

[1:29:38] goodness filled with all knowledge able
[1:29:40] to add to it also to admonish one
[1:29:43] another first corinthians we'll stop
[1:29:45] right here
[1:29:46] musicians get ready come on
[1:29:49] first corinthians 2 verse 12 says now we
[1:29:51] have received not the spirit of the
[1:29:52] world
[1:29:55] we need to get rid of the spirit of the
[1:29:57] world
[1:29:59] but the spirit which is what of god
[1:30:03] vessels of honor
[1:30:06] that we might know the things that are
[1:30:08] what freely given to us of god
[1:30:12] if you're not getting something from god
[1:30:14] you've got a problem
[1:30:16] i got a problem because it's not god's
[1:30:18] problem
[1:30:21] which things also we speak not in the
[1:30:23] words which man wisdom teacheth
[1:30:25] tonight if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:30:27] you don't understand half of what i'm
[1:30:29] saying
[1:30:30] i am sorry
[1:30:32] but please say god i want to understand
[1:30:35] i want to know what this is i want to
[1:30:37] know about this person i've never met
[1:30:40] before
[1:30:41] meeting folks he's right here where you
[1:30:43] can meet him
[1:30:45] the holy ghost is not way out younger
[1:30:48] it's right here now thee
[1:30:50] which things also we speak not in the
[1:30:52] words of man's wisdom but which the holy
[1:30:54] ghost what teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:30:58] things with spiritual
[1:31:00] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:31:02] things of the spirit of god there it is
[1:31:05] for they are what foolishness unto him
[1:31:09] neither can he know them because they
[1:31:11] are what spiritually discerned
[1:31:14] but he that is spiritual
[1:31:17] judges all things
[1:31:19] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[1:31:22] who hath known in the mind of the lord
[1:31:24] known the mind of the lord that he may
[1:31:25] instruct him
[1:31:27] but paul says but we have
[1:31:29] the mind of christ musicians come
[1:31:32] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:31:34] only but also in power that's what i'm

[1:32:22] for it's impossible for those who are
[1:32:23] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:32:26] heavenly gift and were partakers of the
