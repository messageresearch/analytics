TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i just do because we got ministers meeting this coming saturday that brother bob and i are going to and um i'll drive and it'll give him time to get a sunday school club get a center code i can sleep better driving all right um and then the next sunday i want you to mark this on your calendar because i want you to really pray for i don't want you to pray that that anything i do is right is that god will do it through me because i'm going to miami for five services in four days on may the fourth uh we're gonna fly out on the 14th again and i both just go with me it'll be the 15th one service 16 point service 17th one service in the 18th could be two services and it's a convention with the haitian brothers and sisters down in miami so just keep me in your prayers i'll be doing all five services so yeah i did it in jamaica six nights in a row but let's travel that's that yeah plus an hour and a half there an hour and a half back we actually hit a dog in this plastered that thing all over them i never woke up i never knew we'd even hit anything when we got home were you driving no not in jamaica i don't drive anywhere you were sleeping they drive on the wrong side of the road i'd have been driving way to hit more than a dog but um brother aaron was in the front and brother brad was with me and i was in the back and i think it was like the fifth or sixth night or fifth night man i was beat we got home with brother keith and they're all they all get out every one of them they're looking at the front of the car and what's why are you looking in front of the car he said you didn't feel it hit that they hammered a big old dog that didn't kill it there's a hammer i said no i just started with one of those bumps in the road in jamaica like they always are so just remember and that was oh six so that was about uh almost 10 years ago so i'm 10 years older now so just start praying for me well i'm going to start actually with this is what i'm going to do so you can pray about it i'm going to start with poor knowledge predestination for knowledge and then do like what brother dale's been doing on the masterpiece family but i'm going to put it in the genesis 126 series that i've been doing so and then run us all the way to um revelations just watch service up there all right bob i won't do that um no signal bob how about on the other end all right let's turn anyway to second peter technology is not going to stop us that's all right if it doesn't happen we'll be all right i'll just turn it back on real quick that's okay it's got to be the uh the next one no the next one there we go let's go to dropbox and now we're right back where we started second peter one now what we're doing is for for our brother that's here now we've been through this is numb part 40 five so we've been since about december on the statue of repurpose before that wasn't it but october on a statue of a perfect man taking each virtue and showing it and applying it to our life and applying it in scripture and we saw that you must have the new birth before you can start receiving the virtues now the prophet of god said that you can have these virtues and not be born again but they're not godly virtues you've got you can be a virtuous person and not be born again but these these virtues that we're talking about for the past 45 many sermons or sunday school classes have been godly virtues add to your faith so in other words as to what you have virtue add to what you have knowledge because peter james and john they had these virtues working in their life paul had these virtues working in their life because that was the faith of the fathers that was where jesus had tutored them for three and a half years then the holy ghost fell on the word that they held that's why you've got to hear the word you got to hear the word first you can't just get a revelation from nothing sorry you can't faith comes by hearing faith doesn't come by preaching faith comes by hearing you gotta hear from the five-fold ministry and that's what brother brown when he gets up to godliness we read a little bit last sunday but when he gets up to godliness he throws it right back to ephesians 4 and 12. so that's the only way you're going to get godliness is you're going to have to hear evangelists pastors teachers prophets and apostles the fivefold minister there's no other way of getting it there's no one you don't receive the holy ghost just because it falls out of the sky the seed life comes through the body right right all right the seedlife comes through the body you got to hear the word first why didn't paul just get the holy ghost when jesus knocked him down on the master's road he didn't right he had to go see anna that's right which was the holy ghost-filled person right and had to receive the holy ghost by laying on the hands by him nice all right so i believe the same way with these virtues you can't just acquire these virtues it would be too easy to be able to just buy them and and be like you know something very easy to me these are victories as brother keith reed said these are trials of life right right because remember simon peter let's read here i'll show you right here simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained so you got to get it you're not born with it hello you're not born with it that's right right you're born with a representation that you're going to come to it but you're not born with it right if you were born with a new birth you wouldn't need a new birth all right so your first birth was wrong and you needed a new birth yes to be born again simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained obtained means go get something right you know the the um grocery store some of them do deliver but the grocery store doesn't just if you need some eggs they don't just bring you eggs you got to go get them so in other words you got to go get in your car so this is something that you've got to do you've got to obtain those that have obtained a lot of precious faith i was kind of thinking meditating the other day on how to approach a few things in in miami and and you don't want to be so bold but but the bible says that the kingdom of god is taken by force you can be meek and mild and humble if you want to i'm just not that way i'm like peter pull the sword first right then we'll talk about it later okay i'll cut your head off and then i'll pray for you put it back on and i'll pray for you but the kingdom of god the bible says is taken by foreign brother bob uh preach the sermon on it so it's not that i'm i am very leery of these preachers that walk around with this humble attitude and i just don't i don't get that right bible says the kingdom of god is taken by force remember what jesus told peter said peter put your sword up that's not the way it's done but that was a natural type of what the spiritual was going to be he knew peter was going to pull his sword on the day of pentecost peter pulled his sword but he wasn't the natural sword it was the sword of the word right all right so jesus was training them and teaching them that instead of using the natural force it's going to be by spiritual it's going to be a spiritual force and we must be confident because the bible says come boldly to the throne of grace paul paul gets up one day and he says you'll be judged by my gospel why can't we stand up and say that as ministers if we're preaching 100 word of god why can't we stand up and say you're going to be judged by what i say today that's right amen right why aren't we coming to the place to where we can look at people in the eye and say you're not preaching what brother mountain's preaching right i'm glad they kicked that preacher out of that church a couple weeks ago yeah should have done it a year ago amen and you know nothing against the brother but if he's going to sit there and land back brother brown but he was wrong here and couldn't get it straight in here well then don't follow him come on then don't follow him out get out of the message just go do something different that's not true well if this message doesn't change our body then we need to find one that will because there's a there's a proof of the resurrection in what the prophet taught us so with the statue of a perfect man i believe it's one of the most ill-taught i said ill-talk subjects in the message they just said oh that's that's your perfect man you know you just gotta have this no you those are required these things are required brother brown said they're required yes they're required for a body change you're not going to take a body change as a baby that's right you're not going to take a body change it virtue right though you may have godly virtue the only way you're gonna take a body change is you see that little top up there that says love that little mini pyramid at the top that's gotta come to you in its pure form right and you can't jump up there and get it that's right twice took 50 years since the prophet left the scene for us to just now really realize what he preached i believe we just now are getting that's right the real essence of the message of the hour that's right back before it was hair and dress and living right and doing right and you know trying to trying to change it god sent a prophet and and the prophet's right well you know now they've come to where we've took the voice and i believe we as a church and as many other churches we are as the voice are the voice of that angel but now they're trying to tear the voice down after all these 50 years all right so you see that there's a mixed multitude just like there was in the when israel came out the mixed multitude was the one to give them the problems all right so the mixed multitude and the message is what's giving us the problem but here if we have obtained like precious faith let's read it with us through the righteousness of god our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord so the only way you're going to get it is through the knowledge of the lord because paul says we must have the mind of christ it's like daddy was talking about last night in the bible in the bible bible study this message did not just turn us back to the day of pentecost with peter james and john this message takes us back in the mind of god before the foundation of the world because after eating this is fallen this is the permissive will of god but paul says we must have a mind of christ the mind of christ didn't fall exactly right that's why that genesis 1 26 man it's so important for us to see that that genesis 1 26 man never sinned right never did anything wrong never never had a bad thought never never disagreed with the word of god and when you connect with that see that brings that is the mind of god that's where the that's where this was developed it was developed in the mind of god brother i said let's go back in the back part of god's mind back part the intelligence let's go back paul says we must have the mind of christ what are they talking about they like to think like that's right well see our carnal thinking is what got us out of the garden that's right so our carnal thinking is not going to get us back in the garden right so we must jump over just for a better word jump over all that that happened in the garden we got to go back to that genesis 1 26 man to where he is back in power again because that genesis 1 26 man is what controlled the world that's right before the fall right amen and we see a little bit of that now because each one of us like we're talking about last night um someone was praying sister susan was praying mom and dad was praying that this big storm that was going to have tuesday and wednesday it was going to come through 100 chance of rain hail lightning storms we were going to have all kinds of stuff didn't touch us he didn't touch us we had a little wind and i said okay and it was your prayer and i believe until we get to the other side you're not going to really know that you're simple what's your simple little prayer change but your simple little prayer and you said a prayer and something didn't happen you said well that was choice or that was chance or no i don't believe in choice i believe in choice but i don't believe in chance right i believe in luck that's right i believe in love if you're a christian you're not lucky you're blessed you're part of the family and god's going to take care of his family members what a what a great god that takes care of his family like he does all right so i'll start preaching here in just a minute let's go back to this grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of god and jesus according as his defined his divine power hath given unto us so you take his divine power you give it unto us all things that pertain into what life that's your natural living and godliness now roman goblin is here that godliness is the same godliness as far as a uh definition but to me godliness covers all virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brother that's all godliness because if it comes from god it's all godly all right because the word godliness is simply to be like god all right now according to his divine power have given us all things that pertain to life and godliness so we're talking about our life lessons and how to live like god through the knowledge of him and how we're going to get the knowledge if you got the new birth you got everything you need but you're going to have to hear the word from a preacher our teacher our brother our sister a sister all right to get this knowledge of god all right now we we know sisters don't preach but i'm going to tell you something brother brown said a holy ghost phil woman can help you that's right if you'll listen to him say we don't listen to him in the torped but they got to go up this statue just like we do it ain't just for the men there was women in that upper room and at 120 they were some sisters up there they came out with the same holy ghost of men have we don't believe in a female holy ghost and a male holy ghost that's right only one right one of those stinking doctrines we were talking about a male holy ghost and a female holy ghost anyway through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises so this is exceeding and great that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this he has brought a dissertation of what you've got to have and all this all bringing it all the way down and he says beside this so in other words verse 1 through 4 is talking about your new birth that's your baby form new birth being born again as a baby nobody understand that say amen amen and besides this so it must be something you got to add too and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue convert your knowledge knowledge temperance temper patience patience godliness godless brother kinds brother congress charity for if these things be in you and abound in other words they're going to overflow remember the dream sister shepard had about the pyramid the water was overflowing out of that pyramid and pushing trash out of what was the water brother brown said that was the holy ghost the holy ghost was getting the trash out yeah even after you're born again you still got trash hello you're not born again in your spirit i wish you're not born again in your flesh for sure that's right but you're born again in your soul and then you let your soul work out through the spirit into the spirit into the flesh all right but your flesh only does what the inside man tells them to be that's right for if these things be in you and abound they make you remember that word i said last sunday they make you in other words they're gonna it's gonna make you become a christian that's right all right they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful look at the promise you won't be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ now that word godliness which is we're on now means holiness reverence respect piety towards god godliness now first timothy 3 says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh of who jesus right justified in the spirit of jesus sin of angels jesus preached unto the gentiles jesus believed on in the world jesus received up in the glory now let's make it a little personal and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifested in if we don't see something personal then it just happened to jesus and that's denominational or what happened to jesus therefore i got it no that ain't it it's got to happen to you you got to put your name so if god was manifest in your flesh that's right and the word was made flesh that's right justified in your spirit this way scene of angels we all got one don't we don't we believe we got an angel brother we did we got an angel right don't you think the angels doesn't see us they're ministering spirits they're helping us get through this life we just don't see them right preaching to the gentiles absolutely what we're doing now believe not in the world and then when we take a body change we're received up in the glory actually in the soul you're already received up in the glory because you're sitting in heavenly places you've got to read the scriptures for that not as something over there this has got to be you if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine where unto thou has attained as that word attained again but refused profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness so godliness is an exercise not bodily exercise exercise opening the book read the bible listen to tape all right for bodily exercise profit is little it does profit a little but godliness is profitable unto all things so when we get up here you know it's like i said before patience is something you got to deal with right temperance is something you got to deal with and when it comes to godliness godliness breaks out from you and the people got to see that they got to see that god's working in your life all right for bodily exercise prophet is little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is well it's not just going to help us in the life hereafter it's promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come all right so it's going to carry you all the way through now look what paul sums it up and says this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation in other words it's worthy of accepting this if you will accept it now look second timothy 3 5 we didn't get to but brother branham i looked up this morning there's 396 quotes that brother brown has the word godliness 396 396. about 390 of them he quotes the scripture right here having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away you can't deny the power of god if you have it in you that's just one two one plus one is two right you can't you cannot say it's not powerful and have it in you so you you can have a form of godliness like brother burns said you can even paul said you can know all mysteries he said you can know the bible from front to back you can even live a good godly life but unless the power is behind that from such turn away in other words get away from it but 390 quotes brother brown quotes this scripture and he's talking about denominational people and people that have a form of godliness now we don't want to have that's not a form of godliness that is godliness a form of godliness is satan right a form of godliness is the devil the devil wants to be just like god he don't want to be a drunk or uh or or a prostitute or or any no he don't want to be that he he's here today he got here before you did if you'll admit it we probably brought him with us that's right because he plays on this playground right here the power of god is his word that's right it's the power of god and the salvation the word of god that's why we have to exercise so i said in timothy it's barely exercise prophecy little but godliness is profitable in all things but you can have a form of godliness all my brother brown said you can have the holy spirit on your spirit every day in your life and die and go to hell well what that does is it's an anointing that's what anointed ones at the end time are they're anointed by the true holy spirit balaam was anointed by the true god that's right right caiaphas was anointed by god that's why accomplished could feel things that's why typhus he was a high priest he was in that office but he yielded for fame and fortune and money and all that other stuff and had a form of godliness because he denied the power that was standing in front of him which was jesus christ and anytime you deny jesus christ there's one thing for sure you do not have the power in you not saying that you can't get born again but at that moment you're not a part of the family of god if you deny the power so that's why we come up to godliness and we'll uh we'll just read i want to read one down we didn't get to this let's read this one first is that you were perfect ma'am excuse me let's turn to ephesians four and find out i'm sorry i got my fonts too small but i i got to learn what font to use maybe that's a little better let's turn to ephesians 4 and find out over here what in the book of ephesians it says about this thing too about how we should do it ephesians the fourth chapter beginning with the twelfth verse ephesians four twelfth verse all right let's begin at the 11th verse and he gave some apostles some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office that's what our problem is and the message we've got pastors evangelizing we've got evangelist pasteurizing that's exactly what it is pasteurizing we got apostles that want to go all over the country and and apostle the world but then they want to pastor a group of people so they can make money and don't have to work then you got teachers and evangelists and all the people like that so and brother brown fulfilled all five offices because he was a prophet he could do that this thing's loose he's a prophet he can do that he's not he wasn't a five-fold ministry prophet though right he was a prophet to the age he wasn't a part of that he was the fifo ministry for his time okay but he wasn't a prophet in the fifo ministry right he was a prophet to the age the church age right and he fulfilled all because remember the scripture says do the work of an evangelist he had to get the word out that's what he was sent here for to get the word out in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he got the word out then you see all these places if you if you'll look even in look at the different places you went florida and look at the city in those cities there's messy churches now right lima ohio um of course jeffersonville's got three or four you got macon georgia he went there then you got florida you've got um louisiana rutherfordton north carolina if you'll look at some of the sermons he preached within ruth which is you know all right little rock all the way you'll see that's where he had to get the message out he had to get it out to the people so remember don't try to take the other man's office all right see some evangelists some pastors some teachers i'll read it and we can look at it later for the perfecting of god he said does that read like that congregation says no all right the perfection of what saints saints who are the saints the sanctified ones amen the ones that started from down here i believe he was talking about the pyramid down here all right perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry ministry of jesus christ for the edifying of the body of christ for the edifying building it up edifying until till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the son of god and to the perfect man unto the assurance of life to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so that's what we're looking at is we're looking at now godliness let me see oh he says the song to be like jesus to be like jesus we seen it on earth i want to be like him now watch his watch his last statement when he sings this song that's godliness when he was smack smile on one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoken rough too he didn't speak he didn't ride back godly always looking for one thing all right so it brings it down to one point always look into one thing i always do that which pleases the father boy now how short are we jesus always please the father now that's our commission in godliness is to always please the father that's what it says i always do that which pleases father see yes sir always that's godliness to be about the father's business now i know we have life and stuff that we have to live and i don't want us to be uh in this church there's some that are real liberal and there's some that are real strict i think we're kind of in the middle i like to be in the middle of everything all right but if you're in the middle and you say well yes we believe in hair and dress but if you're not born again you're still going to wear pants you're going to slip around and do it if you're not born again you're going to cut your hair i don't care who you are because something's going to get on you and it's going to happen it's just the way it is but if you're born again you won't do those things right so get born again then you don't it's not that we put that away but paul says leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ right paul knew about the statue of a perfect man but he didn't know it like brother brown drew it on the chart and and all that but paul knew that peter said add to your faith virtue knowledge typically and all these things and he knew that and he said hey leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ listen i like milk i have a glass before i go to bed pretty much every night that's not all i have i like meat like i told benny you know benny's on that vegetarian diet thing you know there was a brother claude me and i were talking about he said he said there was a preacher one time was sitting in a in a uh airport and there was this lady scent beside him and they got to talk and she was a vegetarian and she got a call and said well now the lord says you know to eat the herbs of the field and the grass and all that stuff and all that you know and all that and said the preacher looked over and said well that's fine sister said but god gave me the wrong kind of teeth for that he gave me he gave me canines and incisors so i could eat meat with it so if god wanted me to be a vegetarian he gave me the wrong kind of teeth but see you can you can take that though and and this having a form of godliness you can make everything be a form you can say well if you do this or don't do that if you do that and we do believe in dudes and don't right right but if you're not born again you're going to do it anyway right so then you just look at that and you say well how are we going to know whether we go up the stack of a perfect man one gage to me and i fall short of it too from right here i don't read and study like i used to yeah because when i first started as a young christian i was reading three or four books a day like that because i'm about to read three or four books a day and i don't listen to tapes because i can't i'm just that way i can't concentrate on a tape i'd rather read a book i get more from a book i can't tape my mind wonders when there's a tape on but when i'm reading a book i have to read and concentrate but but that's okay you might can listen better and that see that doesn't make you wrong in me right or me right and you're wrong that's right it's how you can get it that's how god put it to you but you know what if you don't read more than you used to you got to be backslid yeah are you really never come to the fullness of god one of the two if you don't attend church more than you used to well the scripture says i'm not listen i'm not being mean about it the bible says more as the day approaches you go to church more so if you don't go to church more now than you did before you got a problem admit your problem much more the bible says as they approach it so we're some of us are going backwards it says much more well i got this hey i know we all got things we got to do and if somebody took a job and and you had to work two months and you was out of church so what but then the next two months you say well i got six more months of it and then i got another year of it and then i got well i got this is don't kick your ox in the ditch if your box gets in the ditch get it out that that's a brother that's what daddy always says he said now if yours gets in the ditch that's okay but if you kick him over in the ditch just so you can stay out of church to get him out you got a problem you buy you a brand new cadillac can't pay for it you got to work on sunday you got a problem if your job takes seven days you remember when one time i had to be out one sunday morning because of my job and that's because our plant manager was dying of cancer and i had to go in on sunday morning and about kill me but that was one time in 15 years that's one time in 15 years how about some of us did we used to go to church every wednesday every sunday and then now we just make it every once in a while on sunday and can't get back on sunday night get full on sunday morning i guess and then wednesday night's hard i know that a lot of you live a far away and that's that's why we got the internet that's why we've got the live streaming but don't use that as a crutch and how many of you are really looking at the live streaming when you are at home oh we know you can tell yeah while i'm meddling again all right let's go but listen when we come to godliness we got these points have got to be look how it's going look how that pyramid is shaping up it's getting narrower and narrower so what's got to happen is we gotta fit inside that narrow gap it's not way down here in phase where we can got a little wiggle room and a little movement yes a lot of people got faith but then a lot of people got gobbling and definitely brotherly kindness i told you brother kindness is gonna be rough did you say while ago that the flesh only does what the soul tells you your flesh only does what the inside tells you do you flash there's nothing more than still fine this would never be perfect i mean but it will be perfect for what's inside it will be perfect for what's inside from what's inside your flesh is seed taste fill smell in here that has nothing to do with the holy ghost right so that was my question your body is contrary but god give us those five senses to contact this world we're going to keep those five senses listen when brother i went across the curtain of time they still had their five senses and they weren't even in flesh bodies right so you're going to keep your seed taste filled smelling here but it's going to be all of our seed tasteful smelling hair is contrary to god in the state it is now right but you're never going to lose that but if you take the spirit out of this man take the soul out of this man that body can lay there for 100 years and it'll never do anything wrong you got it now yeah the body without the fly i mean the the body without this soul is dead you just lay in there there's nothing to it that's why you can knock people in the head and you can you can they can go into comas well they still got their soul but their body can't work and look at the elderly people when as you get older your body doesn't work your mind doesn't work you know brother brown said you can go crazy and still have the holy ghost why because it's this thing this thing this spirit inside of you it's not the soul i look at brother tatum and sister tatum and a good example of a godly man and god the woman we all believe that amen but here they are they had to be put in a nursing home and you know they would you know they get mad at each other or you know but to me that god don't see that but we're so encapsulated in this oh nasty flesh till that's what in our spirit which is memory reason conscious affection imagination now that can be used of god or it can be used with the devil but see in your flesh as your flesh gets weaker things happen more you you brother ramsay you can go crazy and still have the holy ghost okay you can still go crazy and still have a holy ghost okay so that doesn't include that doesn't do anything with the inside god what happened is we're so much in this sin cursed world that this is cursed so as it gets older the curse stays on this that's why somebody's going to take a body change it's got to come from within it can't be what mom and daddy brought you it's got to be what's inside works its way out and changes this thing that's why your chain starts at the new birth right because it makes this body that used to hold the beer in its hand now hold the bible same hand same mouth that i used to say bad words i used to curse people now i hope to god that it helps people you understand it's the same amount right but it's the motivation that's inside that brings it out okay all right you
