[1:24] the house of God I trust that you are
[1:27] appreciate you all praying for us while
[1:29] we were away this this past Sunday we
[1:33] were in Beaufort South Carolina
[1:35] administering their brother Samuel now
[1:37] head US church a little Spanish church
[1:39] there not far from brother Jason Watkins
[1:41] church and it's just a little group he's
[1:44] been there a few years it's got a small
[1:47] group but it's a growing group and so he
[1:51] invited me to come out there and we had
[1:52] some good fellowship brother Samuel
[1:54] sends his greetings to brother Samuel
[1:56] and brother Wade and he knows of you of
[1:59] both of you but just about I've invited
[2:03] him to come to the youth meeting because
[2:05] he's got some youth there at the church
[2:06] so Lord will and maybe he'll be here in
[2:08] July if we if we have it so so but we
[2:12] had a good time and also got to spend a
[2:15] little bit of time with brother Jason
[2:17] DeMars down there he he knew I was in
[2:19] the area so he we uh he invited me and
[2:22] we went over to his house had some
[2:23] fellowship and talked about a couple of
[2:26] projects maybe that he needs some help
[2:28] in in the Spanish area on the Spanish
[2:31] side so so we uh we had a good time
[2:33] really really wonderful brother to uh to
[2:36] to fellowship with so really had a good
[2:39] time I appreciate all of your prayers I
[2:41] want I want you all to be seated for
[2:44] just a moment I wanted to just give just
[2:47] right before we go to the word just give
[2:48] about five minutes just a quick report a
[2:51] little mission report on on the on
[2:54] what's going on in Honduras right now
[2:56] because if you don't know we there's a
[2:59] brother that we support there on a
[3:01] monthly basis in Honduras brother Eric
[3:03] and he's a pastor there and is if you
[3:07] remember he was the one that that the
[3:09] church helped to buy him some brand new
[3:12] tires for the truck that he he travels
[3:16] back and forth about an hour and 20
[3:17] minutes back from from his house to
[3:21] church to be able to minister to the
[3:23] little church that God gave him and so
[3:26] unfortunately he he has not been able to
[3:30] go to the church to actually minister at
[3:35] the church because of the lockdowns that
[3:38] they have in in in Honduras the city
[3:41] where he lives they cannot even go out
[3:44] out of a certain radius and so since the
[3:47] church is in the church is located in
[3:50] another municipality they have not been
[3:53] able he's only been been being able to
[3:54] visit it like once every 15 days so the
[3:57] church there they have people there in
[3:59] that municipality where the church is
[4:01] located
[4:02] there's brothers that are ministering at
[4:05] the church but brother eric has not been
[4:07] at the church and they don't have any
[4:10] resources as far as being able to stream
[4:13] in and things like that because it's let
[4:15] me tell you this area is is in the woods
[4:18] pretty much where the church is and it's
[4:21] very remote so and most of the
[4:23] individuals that live and go to the - -
[4:26] brother Eric's church there are older
[4:30] older people so they're not in tune with
[4:32] technology and things like that so so he
[4:37] is he's just having to do whatever he
[4:39] can but right before all the pandemic
[4:41] all this stuff happened with the
[4:43] coronavirus there was a church there in
[4:46] the city where he lives that a couple of
[4:48] years ago when I was there last time in
[4:50] Honduras the pastor was there was
[4:53] unfortunate events that took place
[4:55] regarding the pastor so he had to step
[4:58] down and when he stepped down the church
[5:01] had about I'd say maybe 80 people in the
[5:04] church when he stepped down he took he
[5:07] took all the of the pulpit the the the
[5:11] chairs everything from the church and
[5:13] left the people without anything and so
[5:16] and and so the church was pretty much
[5:20] you know kind of split so some of the
[5:23] people from the church some of the
[5:25] leadership that was still left there at
[5:27] the church asked brother Eric if he
[5:28] could come and work with them and maybe
[5:31] help them so being that the church is
[5:34] located in the area where he lives he's
[5:37] been able to work with these people more
[5:38] often so it's kind of strange how that
[5:41] worked out
[5:42] and he knew of the group and I even met
[5:45] some of the people from the group when I
[5:47] was there last time but he's been
[5:49] working with them full-time and let me
[5:52] tell you brother eric is a hard-working
[5:55] brother be as young as he is trying to
[5:59] hold two jobs and as a matter of fact
[6:01] one of the jobs he's gonna give it up
[6:03] mainly because he wants to just come by
[6:06] faith just fully dedicate himself more
[6:09] to the ministry that's a big leap of
[6:11] faith especially in a country like
[6:12] Honduras and so so he's having to work
[6:17] there quite often working on the radio
[6:19] as well
[6:20] and he that's where he had asked me if I
[6:24] could help
[6:25] send sermons went on a weekly basis
[6:28] there on the radio and it just the radio
[6:30] spreads out a big area there in that
[6:34] city named tal anga and it goes out
[6:37] quite a few miles so on a day on a
[6:40] weekly basis I've been preaching at the
[6:43] house and so what and so what I what I
[6:46] do I've been preaching I'd say maybe for
[6:50] the last - two months - or two and a
[6:52] half months and but the thing is is that
[6:55] it's gone out to a lot of people because
[6:57] not just believers listening to this
[6:58] radio station it's it's unbelievers out
[7:02] and don't you know that there are
[7:03] listening to it as well
[7:04] and so it's been a blessing and a lot of
[7:09] work to be done there's a lot there's
[7:10] people that this church now by the help
[7:13] that the brother eric is is given to the
[7:17] church there the church is now getting
[7:19] back to its feet again
[7:21] they haven't been they haven't declared
[7:23] any any pastor yet so that's something
[7:27] to be praying about but the church is
[7:30] getting back to his feet some young
[7:31] people are going back to the church
[7:33] there's people there wanting to get
[7:35] baptized so they're trying to leave kind
[7:37] of their past behind you know and just
[7:39] trying to move on with the word so you
[7:42] all pray for that little work there for
[7:43] that church now he says that there's
[7:45] about 70 people now so it's a it's a
[7:48] good sized group and there's lots of
[7:50] work to be done so every time he talks
[7:53] to me about that stuff I just want to go
[7:54] so
[7:55] I want to go so bad but you know God has
[7:59] his people that there and uh at least we
[8:01] everybody preach to him I know through
[8:03] the radio so but you all pray for
[8:06] brother Eric and he sends his greetings
[8:08] to each one of you thanking you once
[8:10] again brother Dale by the way at each
[8:11] one of you for for the support on a
[8:13] monthly basis as well all right so let's
[8:17] stand to our feet again and we're gonna
[8:20] go to the Word of God we're gonna read
[8:22] in Matthew chapter 6 verses 9 through 13
[8:27] Matthew 6 verses 9 through 13 this is a
[8:34] very familiar scripture to all of us the
[8:36] Bible says here after this manner
[8:39] therefore pray pray ye Jesus speaking
[8:41] our Father which thou art in heaven
[8:44] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[8:48] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[8:52] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[8:55] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[8:58] our debtors and lead us not into
[9:01] temptation but deliver us from evil for
[9:04] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[9:08] the glory forever amen amen so this this
[9:13] evening I want to speak on the on the
[9:17] topic the hidden I forgot I forgot the
[9:19] title now but the hidden kingdom the
[9:22] hidden kingdom in plain view and this is
[9:24] a preach this a couple of years ago and
[9:27] I just felt led to revisit this again
[9:29] especially for some of the newer ones
[9:31] that are coming in and also some of the
[9:33] the young people that have that are
[9:36] coming in and trying to serve the Lord
[9:39] maybe just be something that could help
[9:41] them so hey the word of god is the word
[9:43] of God sometimes we just forget things
[9:46] and and I just felt so pressed to to
[9:49] speak about this so let's just bow our
[9:51] heads our gracious Lord Jesus we thank
[9:53] you Father God once again for your love
[9:56] mercy and grace father and we just pray
[9:58] now that you bless your word Lord as it
[10:00] goes forth father garden are you just
[10:02] anointed Lord anoint my lips Lord that I
[10:04] may say father God what your people need
[10:06] to hear and what will glorify you
[10:08] may you Heavenly Father just anoint the
[10:10] ears and let them hear father God reveal
[10:13] to them your word Lord and the
[10:14] importance father god of of the kingdom
[10:16] of God being within us Lord Jesus - so
[10:19] father God that we can manifest it
[10:21] father God on the outside Lord Jesus to
[10:23] a dying world Lord who needs to see
[10:25] Christ in action father Lord we love you
[10:28] we thank you we commit this time into
[10:30] your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:33] pray amen amen god bless you saying so
[10:36] you may be seated
[10:40] amen so we're gonna try to go through
[10:43] this as quick as we possibly can I last
[10:47] last time when I had a I had a prayer a
[10:51] PowerPoint I had a lot of content there
[10:53] and so what I did is I tried to condense
[10:55] it as much as I possibly could and and
[10:58] there was still a lot of content so so
[11:01] you just pray for me you bear with me
[11:03] and and and and and just just pray that
[11:07] God would that you get something from
[11:09] the Word of God this evening hey man I
[11:11] believe this is very important
[11:13] praise the Lord all the Word of God is
[11:14] very important so amen so if the
[11:17] brothers could start with uh with the
[11:18] first slide amen amen now let's look at
[11:25] the phrase of the King the kingdom of
[11:27] God so we see that that phrase is
[11:29] mentioned many times throughout the
[11:31] Bible and the phrase the kingdom of God
[11:34] started to be used at the time with John
[11:36] the Baptist coming that's when you
[11:38] started noticing that that phrase was
[11:40] was being used and it the phrase is used
[11:45] commonly between tert Angley with the
[11:48] phrase is the Kingdom of Heaven or the
[11:49] kingdom and so whenever you see those
[11:52] phrases in the Bible it all means the
[11:55] kingdom of God and it's not anything
[11:57] different it's it's the kingdom amen
[11:59] praise God let's go to the next slide
[12:02] now in Matthew you these are the
[12:05] scriptures in Matthew three one two two
[12:07] and those days Came John the Baptist
[12:09] preaching in the wilderness of Judea and
[12:10] saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[12:13] heaven is at hand Matthew 4:17 from that
[12:16] time Jesus began to preach and to say
[12:18] repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[12:21] and you have to think about it that way
[12:24] because as we're gonna see here in just
[12:25] a moment that the kingdom of God is God
[12:29] amen is him a man so here's the kingdom
[12:32] of God manifested physically when Jesus
[12:34] was here on earth amen praise God but
[12:37] that wasn't enough in God's plan you see
[12:40] God's plan needed to be go go further
[12:42] than that it wasn't just enough to have
[12:44] the kingdom of God standing in flesh
[12:46] just in the body of Jesus Christ and
[12:49] just in one man do you see what I'm
[12:51] saying
[12:51] it had to also manifest itself in a
[12:54] manner many member body that was the
[12:57] fullness of God's plan that's what God
[12:59] wanted amen that was the thought he had
[13:01] from the beginning amen so it's so easy
[13:05] to get caught up with with all Jesus on
[13:08] the cross and and and Jesus Jesus Jesus
[13:11] Jesus which is good we thank God for
[13:14] what he did for us but now there's
[13:17] brother Graham said that there's a part
[13:18] that he's done that he didn't fulfill
[13:20] that we need to fulfill in this hour
[13:22] that's a direct quote from brother
[13:24] Branham you see because let me tell you
[13:27] what Saints and you think about this
[13:29] nobody in this hour has been a nobody in
[13:33] this day has been available fulfill what
[13:35] what Paul talked about there in
[13:37] Thessalonians nobody not even brother
[13:41] Brandon to be changed in a moment in the
[13:43] twinkling of an eye that's gonna be
[13:46] somebody in this day that that word
[13:50] still needs to be fulfilled it was
[13:52] written but it still needs to be
[13:54] fulfilled Jesus didn't fulfill that
[13:57] neither did brother Brandon now
[14:00] somebody's got to fulfill it I say it's
[14:03] just you and me
[14:04] amen praise God let's go to the next
[14:07] slide
[14:08] so this is what Kingdom meaning of a
[14:12] kingdom is a kingdom or territory it's
[14:14] all used in the New Testament to refer
[14:16] the rule of the Messiah but I like this
[14:19] here says a royal power kingship
[14:21] Dominion rule not to be confused with an
[14:25] actual kingdom not to be confused with
[14:30] actual Kingdom but rather the right or
[14:32] authority to rule over a kingdom
[14:35] praise the Lord when you get the Holy
[14:38] Ghost in your life that gives you the
[14:40] rule amen
[14:42] over that kingdom praise God now or that
[14:46] kingdom gives you power which we will
[14:48] talk about in just a moment gives you
[14:50] power to rule over your worst enemy and
[14:55] who is your worst enemy it's yourself
[15:00] that's your worst enemy brother Dale is
[15:03] not my worst enemy the president is not
[15:07] my worst enemy there's no way that you
[15:09] know the word the Hitler was not even
[15:12] not worst enemy the devil is not even my
[15:14] worst enemy it's myself I've got to be
[15:18] able to put myself down amen
[15:22] that he could take over and that he can
[15:25] rule properly because when you're in the
[15:28] way he can't he can't be in the way when
[15:32] you could you get you're in the way a
[15:33] man next slide
[15:35] I appreciate the brothers in the back
[15:37] and then now let's look at this that
[15:40] Jesus did not establish a physical
[15:42] Kingdom when he was here on earth that
[15:44] was not his purpose his purpose was not
[15:48] to come and and and give the Jews what
[15:52] they wanted what they wanted was a
[15:54] somebody to come down and stump out the
[15:57] Roman rule that they had in that day
[15:59] wanted to just completely take him out
[16:02] and and some and and just come down at
[16:05] the corridors where kfs was the high
[16:08] priest and just ruled and they now at a
[16:12] later point those things will happen
[16:14] there will be a physical Kingdom to be
[16:16] established but it's got to start lowly
[16:20] meek humble first it's got to start
[16:23] something like it doesn't even look like
[16:24] it's the kingdom that's how God wants to
[16:28] start the kingdom amen
[16:30] then those men in John chapter 6 verse
[16:32] 14 then those men when they had seen the
[16:34] miracle that Jesus did said this is of a
[16:37] truth that prophet that should come into
[16:38] the world when Jesus therefore perceived
[16:41] that they would come and take him by
[16:43] force to make him a king he departed
[16:46] again into a mountain himself alone
[16:49] they were the Jews were trying to make
[16:50] him a king by force because they saw
[16:53] potential in him they saw miracles they
[16:56] saw signs they saw things and these are
[16:58] these is the only man that could take
[16:59] out these Romans but he that's not what
[17:02] he had come for he went out on by
[17:04] himself
[17:05] what humility what power amen nextslide
[17:11] so and this for the in Luke it says for
[17:14] the Son of man has come to seek and to
[17:16] save that which was lost and as they
[17:18] heard these things he added in spake a
[17:20] parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem
[17:22] and became and because they thought that
[17:25] the kingdom of God should immediately
[17:27] appear they were seeking for a physical
[17:30] kingdom that's what they wanted next
[17:33] slide and even the disciples in Acts
[17:36] after Jesus resurrection were still
[17:39] seeking a physical Kingdom thinking that
[17:41] something was was physical about what
[17:43] was going on look what look what they
[17:45] asked him here in Acts chapter 1 when
[17:47] they therefore were come together they
[17:49] asked of him saying Lord will doubt at
[17:52] this time restore again the kingdom to
[17:53] Israel now watch what Jesus says and he
[17:57] said unto them this is Jesus it is not
[17:59] for you to know the times or the seasons
[18:00] which the father hath put in his own
[18:03] power but look he turns it back to
[18:06] what's really important and to what they
[18:08] don't recognize that that's what he was
[18:10] trying to preach to them for
[18:12] three-and-a-half years to come to this
[18:15] but ye shall receive power after that
[18:17] the Holy Ghost has come upon you now
[18:20] watch how this kingdom is going to be
[18:22] spread out and ye shall be witnesses
[18:24] unto me both in Jerusalem and in all
[18:27] Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[18:30] uttermost part of the earth but first
[18:33] they had to receive the power without
[18:36] the power a man they were that kingdom
[18:39] could not be established in the hearts
[18:41] of man again it was established in Jesus
[18:45] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[18:47] bodily but the kingdom needed to also
[18:50] now be transferred to you and I Amen
[18:52] that life of Jesus needed to be
[18:54] transferred to you and I therefore we
[18:57] cannot rule and overcome in this kingdom
[19:00] of God
[19:01] trying to establish next slide now let's
[19:06] look at this here Jesus standing before
[19:07] Pilate because this is something very
[19:10] interesting we read in John chapter 18
[19:13] jesus answered my kingdom this is the
[19:17] pilots talking to Jesus and asking him
[19:20] are you a king of the Jews and and he
[19:22] asked him do you say that of your own or
[19:24] did somebody just tell you in other
[19:27] words is this Britain revealed to you or
[19:28] did somebody just tell you so jesus
[19:31] answered an incest to him my kingdom is
[19:33] not of this world if my kingdom were of
[19:37] this world then would my servants fight
[19:40] that I should not be delivered to the
[19:43] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[19:46] hence so Jesus was very very loyal to
[19:52] the kingdom Jesus body yeah you see he
[19:56] was loyal to because he saw he knew what
[20:00] was coming so he wasn't going to bow his
[20:02] that's the reason why he didn't bow his
[20:04] head his knees to Satan when Satan was
[20:07] trying to tempt him see if he would have
[20:10] given up and turned those breath those
[20:12] stones into bread he would have been
[20:15] given into what and it would have been
[20:17] giving up the kingdom but he knew that
[20:20] that kingdom needed to stay in place
[20:22] amen Pilate therefore said unto Him art
[20:25] thou king then jesus answered thou
[20:28] sayest that I'm a king to this and was I
[20:30] born and for this cause came I into the
[20:32] world that I should bear witness unto
[20:34] the truth everyone that is of the truth
[20:38] or that Kingdom I put in parentheses
[20:40] here with my voice when you are of that
[20:44] Kingdom amen you're gonna hear that
[20:47] voice amen
[20:48] there's no other way if that word has
[20:51] been planted in you amen you're going to
[20:54] hear that voice there is no other way
[20:57] you're going to hear from the kingdom so
[20:59] to a true child and daughter of God
[21:01] you're you're hearing from that kingdom
[21:03] every time the word goes forth every
[21:06] time you read the word every time you
[21:08] even go into prayer you're hearing from
[21:11] the kingdom to draw closer come closer
[21:14] amen they almost reminds me of the
[21:17] pilgrims progress
[21:18] remember read read that as he was
[21:20] traveling in his way and he was walking
[21:22] in his way he was getting closer to the
[21:25] kingdom closer to the kingdom and the
[21:26] only way that you're gonna grow in life
[21:29] and and draw closer and closer that this
[21:32] kingdom can manifest in its fullness
[21:34] through your life is for you to be in
[21:36] the word there's no other way no other
[21:39] way
[21:40] praise God next Luke chapter 17 the
[21:46] kingdom of God is not seen physically
[21:48] see it's very easy for us as human
[21:52] beings just as it was for the Jews to
[21:55] seek for physical things to feel
[21:58] something all the time it's always been
[22:02] that way that if I don't feel it or if I
[22:04] don't see it or if I don't smell it or
[22:07] hear it must not be real but God is
[22:11] trying to get us to get out of that
[22:12] mindset Saints that we don't have to
[22:16] physically feel it physically see it
[22:19] physically here amen
[22:22] if we could just believe what God said
[22:24] about you and I and just step into that
[22:26] amen by faith you will see that that
[22:29] Kingdom amen will conspire through your
[22:32] life and and it's in a way that we don't
[22:36] we can't explain but that's what God
[22:39] wants us wants to do amen
[22:42] so look what he says here in Luke and
[22:44] when he was demanded of the Pharisees
[22:47] when the kingdom of God should come see
[22:49] the Pharisees were even asking them the
[22:51] same thing when is the kingdom of God
[22:52] see they were carnal
[22:54] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[22:57] God comes
[22:58] not with come not with observation in
[23:01] other words the kingdom of God is not
[23:03] something that you see the kingdom of
[23:07] God is not something that you can
[23:09] observe or study there is a you study
[23:13] the kingdom yes as a believer but
[23:16] there's not something that a scientist
[23:18] could grab and just break it down and
[23:20] study it look it under a microscope now
[23:22] the kingdom of God is not that way
[23:25] neither shall they say lo here
[23:28] or lo there there's the kingdom or or
[23:30] there's the kingdom and in such and such
[23:32] a place or out west or up north now for
[23:35] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[23:39] that's the reason saying that you cannot
[23:42] explain amen and we're looking at here
[23:44] in just a moment there you cannot
[23:46] explain the new birth in reality you
[23:51] really can't you really the only you
[23:54] can't explain it you just know that it's
[23:56] there you just know that you experience
[23:59] something amen because the kingdom of
[24:03] God is something that you cannot see
[24:05] amen next look what brother Brown says
[24:10] here now I put the COG is not material
[24:12] but within years the COG is the kingdom
[24:14] of God and the smyrna in church age the
[24:17] lair to scene age is one of vast wealth
[24:20] where often the criterion a spirituality
[24:23] is an abundance of earthly Goods my how
[24:26] rich the churches and goods but how poor
[24:29] in spirit my if we could just reverse
[24:32] that right there what a powerful church
[24:34] would it be at this moment now I'm not
[24:36] saying it's not powerful but what I'm
[24:38] saying they may more of that kingdom
[24:40] would be manifested externally amen
[24:42] if we got those roles reversed right
[24:44] there Amen both sometimes we are so
[24:47] looking at earthly Goods and looking at
[24:49] earthly things and and and and yeah and
[24:52] and I'm gonna say young people listen I
[24:54] know you have plans I know you have
[24:56] things in life but let me tell you
[24:58] you've got to seek the you got to seek
[25:00] the kingdom of God first in your life if
[25:04] you want to get somewhere with God and
[25:06] you want to fully have success in life
[25:09] you've got to seek he got first then
[25:12] there's no way around it there is no way
[25:16] around it so if you try to make it on
[25:18] your own and if you're trying to do your
[25:20] own thing and you're not going to get
[25:23] anywhere you're gonna come you're coming
[25:24] to a big fall in your life you're coming
[25:27] to something great that's gonna damage
[25:29] you because of a choice that you make
[25:31] that's why it's so important to seek
[25:34] amen to - to not think about earthly
[25:37] Goods and earthly things but be be
[25:40] strong in spirit
[25:41] instead blessed be poor for yours is the
[25:44] kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not
[25:46] meat and drink it is not material it is
[25:49] it is within us a rich man is rich in
[25:52] God not in worldly things brother
[25:54] Branham says praise God next slide
[25:56] that's a rich man there's God God's
[26:02] kingdom is not of this earth God's
[26:04] kingdom is in our hearts it's the
[26:07] spiritual Kingdom that we're born into
[26:09] it see Jesus said the kingdom of God
[26:13] comes but with not not without violence
[26:16] and what he meant there without
[26:17] observation and the kingdom of God is
[26:20] within you
[26:21] watch the Holy Spirit God's kingdom
[26:24] moving in the man and governing and
[26:26] controlling him that's the kingdom amen
[26:30] that's the kingdom Saints that's going
[26:33] to it's going to establish Amen that at
[26:37] a later point that it be manifested
[26:39] physically which we will look at here in
[26:40] just a moment again it's hard to - next
[26:44] slide again it's something that you
[26:46] can't explain you you have to experience
[26:48] the new birth all comes down if you
[26:52] experience the new birth then you
[26:54] realize what this kingdom is about other
[26:56] than that you're not going to understand
[26:58] it because all you are is just a natural
[27:01] man a natural woman is as the scripture
[27:04] says you have to be born again
[27:07] first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom
[27:10] of God is not in word but in power so
[27:15] this is the kingdom of God is power now
[27:17] I'll put there the word kills but the
[27:19] Spirit is the one that gives life
[27:21] that's why Saints is so important in
[27:24] this hour that you you can have the nut
[27:27] you can have knowledge of this word you
[27:29] can you can know the message from from
[27:32] back and forth and explain every story
[27:35] that brother Branham went through and
[27:37] different stories in the Bible but that
[27:40] is not power that is not the new birth
[27:44] and I'm afraid a lot of many of us
[27:47] sometimes we we can explain things in
[27:50] the Bible but we don't know anything
[27:52] about that power that power of how
[27:55] to overcome this earth that power of how
[27:59] to overcome the line how to overcome
[28:01] cheating how to overcome smoking how to
[28:04] overcome pornography how to overcome all
[28:06] these things that constantly bombard us
[28:11] you need more than just the stories you
[28:15] need more than just knowing the letter
[28:17] you need the life amen that's the only
[28:20] thing that's going to combat your enemy
[28:23] you it's gonna combat you amen
[28:26] acts 1:8 says but ye shall receive power
[28:29] and that power that word power there is
[28:32] Dunamis which comes from the word that's
[28:35] where they get the word dynamite Dunamis
[28:38] you don't want EXO sia power not the
[28:41] part that the disciples had when Jesus
[28:43] gave them power to cast out devils heal
[28:45] the sick and do all these different
[28:47] miracles that's not the power you want
[28:49] that's that the if we get if you get
[28:53] Dunamis power you get all that to you
[28:56] see you can just get that Dunamis power
[28:58] because that Dunamis power is the Holy
[29:00] Ghost amen but if you you can have the
[29:04] letter you can have the physical things
[29:05] I was telling the church there in
[29:06] Beaufort you can do all these physical
[29:09] things as shout and sing loud and shake
[29:13] the preachers hand and do all kinds of
[29:15] but if you don't have the Holy Spirit in
[29:17] your life none of that none of that will
[29:19] benefit you amen none of it will benefit
[29:23] you it it helps you but it won't it's
[29:26] not the Holy Ghost after that the Holy
[29:28] Ghost is come upon you is when you'll
[29:30] receive that power amen I'm here still
[29:33] with me praise God next slide we're
[29:36] trying to move as quick as we can
[29:38] brother Brown says here what is the
[29:40] kingdom of God is within you the
[29:42] kingdoms in you and when the word comes
[29:45] in there now watch what does this word
[29:48] begin it turns itself into power you see
[29:54] I like the way he's explaining this
[29:56] making it say just exactly what it said
[30:01] that is one thing about the new birth
[30:05] that it's going to always lead you to
[30:06] the Word of God and it
[30:08] I always make you say what the word says
[30:10] if you if you are outside of the word or
[30:14] if you're saying something contrary to
[30:16] their word then it's not the Word of God
[30:18] in you because it's not the Holy Spirit
[30:21] in you amen
[30:22] must be your spirit must be your own
[30:24] thought but it can't be the Holy Ghost
[30:25] because the Holy Ghost only gives me
[30:27] indication to its own word amen you stay
[30:31] with the word brother branham says there
[30:33] it is see and it makes it power Jesus
[30:37] Christ the same yesterday today and
[30:39] forever praise the Lord next slide now
[30:44] just real quickly what the kingdom of
[30:47] God is not in Romans 14:17 the Bible
[30:51] says for the kingdom of God is not meat
[30:52] and drink but righteousness and peace
[30:54] and joy in the Holy Ghost if you read
[30:58] that whole chapter which we don't have
[31:00] time to do but you can read there that
[31:02] Paul was speaking to a group who were
[31:04] concerned about the physical things
[31:05] about if I should eat this or not eat
[31:08] this or what more you can read that on
[31:11] your own but I think sometimes
[31:13] especially at the early uh the early
[31:16] part of the when people received a
[31:18] message and and it's been like this
[31:20] throughout all of the ages but sometimes
[31:22] we think that by our works we're going
[31:24] to be able to please God and advance
[31:27] this kingdom or by the things that we do
[31:30] or don't do in a reality that's that
[31:34] that's not what it advances the kingdom
[31:36] that's not what Kurt Amen that's part of
[31:38] the kingdom but that's not the heart of
[31:40] the kingdom and the Satan will want to
[31:43] try to come in and confuse that in your
[31:45] life and say look because you have long
[31:47] hair because you wear long dresses
[31:49] because you brothers don't sag your
[31:51] pants or their or you don't wear tight
[31:52] jeans and all this kind of stuff
[31:54] you must be alright you must be in this
[31:57] kingdom you must be in the word amen but
[32:01] it's that word changing you from day to
[32:03] day is that life in you making you draw
[32:07] closer to the Lord loving the Brethren
[32:09] Amen loving the word wanting to come to
[32:12] church there's a lot of things that go
[32:14] into this kingdom than just dressing in
[32:17] and all this types of stuff so so when I
[32:20] put here faith without works is
[32:22] so you can have faith and not have works
[32:26] because the two go hand-in-hand a man
[32:28] it's dead
[32:29] the life is dead but and also works
[32:31] without faith are dead also so you can
[32:35] do lots of things in the physical but if
[32:37] you don't have that faith in the Word of
[32:38] God amen if that faith has not come in
[32:41] there then it's it's all dead so we got
[32:43] to have both of them right we got to
[32:45] have both things amen next slide the
[32:47] Bram says here God's blood bound
[32:49] promises makes us free from sin and
[32:51] shame and different from the rest of the
[32:53] world you don't have to dress different
[32:56] anybody can dress different you have to
[32:59] be on the inside different the life is
[33:02] on the inside not dressing wearing the
[33:06] kingdom of God is not meat and drink or
[33:08] wearing of apparel but it's the
[33:10] long-suffering goodness gentleness
[33:11] patience in the Holy Ghost amen next
[33:15] next slide then we're going to come over
[33:17] on the Armenian side what do they get
[33:19] works that's the holiness groups works
[33:21] bless God I'll let my hair grow out the
[33:23] women in oh praise God I won't even wear
[33:25] a short sleeve shirt see we all saw
[33:30] those things back in the day you know
[33:32] the man will all will will and so forth
[33:35] like that brother Branham says that has
[33:37] nothing to do with the kingdom that has
[33:40] nothing to do with the king the next
[33:41] slide and the quote continues no sir you
[33:44] can let your hair grow long you can wear
[33:47] dresses whatever you want to or you can
[33:50] do this that or the other and it won't
[33:52] have nothing at all to do with it so
[33:55] that's why I feel terrible when when you
[33:58] win children or young people are taught
[34:00] that that's that's what the message is
[34:03] about that's not what the message is
[34:05] about if you think that that's what the
[34:07] message is about then you need to read
[34:09] the message you need to go back and read
[34:11] what the message is about because that's
[34:13] not what brother Branham was what was
[34:15] preaching amen if so God would just have
[34:18] made some patterns of such Jesus
[34:21] wouldn't have had to die if it was by
[34:24] the way brother dawn would dress Jesus
[34:26] wouldn't have had to die because we all
[34:29] can look the part we all can do it we
[34:33] can look we can look the part but
[34:35] doesn't mean we have the part doesn't
[34:38] mean we have Christ in us amen you're
[34:41] saved because that God saved you by
[34:43] grace and you do these things just in
[34:47] appreciation common decency will tell
[34:50] you that you do those things and
[34:51] appreciation see you you're saved you
[34:55] received a new birth and because you
[34:57] appreciate God for giving you the new
[34:59] birth that's why you've let your hair
[35:00] grow out that's why you stopped sagging
[35:02] your pants that's why you stopped
[35:04] smoking cigarettes and you stopped
[35:05] listening to hip-hop music and you
[35:07] stopped doing these things because you
[35:09] appreciate what God has done for you
[35:11] amen that's why see don't don't put the
[35:16] cart before the horse
[35:17] don't don't think because you do these
[35:18] things you're going in no it's not that
[35:21] way next slide mark chapter 12 now you
[35:27] can be I want to just quickly touch on
[35:29] this not far from the kingdom see some
[35:32] some of us think that that that we can
[35:35] be you can be close to the kingdom you
[35:38] can know the word this goes back to
[35:40] knowing the word knowing knowing the
[35:43] letter but that's just being close to
[35:45] the kingdom that K that doesn't have to
[35:47] be necessarily be in the kingdom there
[35:49] and there Jesus was had said to a scribe
[35:52] that that he was not far from the
[35:55] kingdom because of his knowledge of the
[35:56] word he didn't tell them put him in the
[35:59] kingdom a man if you can go back and
[36:02] read that yourself mark chapter 12 verse
[36:04] 28 to 34 so being close to the kingdom
[36:07] does not mean you are in the kingdom
[36:09] Pilate was standing right there in front
[36:11] of the kingdom that didn't put him in
[36:14] the kingdom
[36:15] many people touched Jesus in that day
[36:19] that touched the kingdom of God
[36:22] physically that didn't put him in the
[36:24] kingdom amen
[36:26] many people and all throughout the ages
[36:29] have gone to church have cried have have
[36:33] have had sensations have had all kinds
[36:36] of feelings and all kinds of things
[36:38] but then some of them where are you
[36:40] there at now
[36:41] where are they now and if it wasn't for
[36:44] the grace of God where would I be where
[36:46] would you be it's only being by the
[36:49] grace of God that you are still that you
[36:50] are here listening to the word this
[36:52] evening a man is only by his grace by
[36:55] His mercy that you have that desiring
[36:58] you to want to hear the word of God amen
[37:02] praise God so you can be close to the
[37:05] kingdom that does not mean that you are
[37:06] in the kingdom next slide you can be
[37:09] here at church
[37:10] that doesn't mean that your church is in
[37:12] you that God's in you so how do you
[37:17] receive this kingdom again we go back to
[37:19] John chapter 3 where Jesus was talking
[37:21] to Nicodemus
[37:22] we're just on verse 3 and we're just
[37:25] skipping in this chapter jesus answered
[37:27] and said unto Him verily verily I say
[37:29] unto thee except in other words this is
[37:32] the only way except a man be born again
[37:35] he could not see the kingdom of God
[37:38] there's no other way around it you want
[37:41] to get to heaven you want to get closer
[37:43] to God you've got to be born again
[37:44] there's no other way around it don't
[37:48] come to a place in life where you are
[37:49] forced to come to that point III hope
[37:54] that nobody here comes to that point you
[37:59] you fix things with God now while there
[38:01] is time amen except a man be born again
[38:05] he cannot see the kingdom of God next
[38:07] slide
[38:07] Brown says you are born into the kingdom
[38:10] of God how by the Holy Ghost what is the
[38:16] Holy Ghost is the word it's the life of
[38:20] God
[38:21] that's God's witness he gives witness by
[38:24] the Word of God see that we've passed
[38:27] from death unto life because we are in
[38:30] the kingdom of God next slide so Jesus
[38:33] continues talking to Nicodemus and the
[38:35] cadenas Nicodemus is spellbound I mean
[38:38] he's confounded he does he doesn't
[38:40] understand what Jesus is telling him and
[38:42] jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[38:45] thee except a man be born of water and
[38:47] of the spirit he cannot enter into the
[38:51] kingdom of God so he cannot he cannot
[38:54] see the kingdom of God
[38:55] now he cannot enter into the kingdom of
[38:57] God and in the water and what is the
[39:02] water and what is the spirit is the Word
[39:03] of God it's the life of God amen praise
[39:06] God so next slide or the Bram says here
[39:10] no matter what it looks like here we
[39:11] don't look at what we see we look at
[39:13] what we do not see is that right anyhow
[39:15] to see doesn't mean to look up the word
[39:18] see means to understand Jesus said
[39:22] except a man be born of water and spirit
[39:24] he cannot see the kingdom of God in
[39:27] other words he can't understand the
[39:30] kingdom of God until he's born again see
[39:33] you have to accept it by faith and then
[39:37] when he comes into you you understand it
[39:41] amen I like that when he comes into you
[39:45] then you can understand it in other
[39:48] words when you let that when you hear
[39:50] that word in that word does something in
[39:52] you and you say and you say amen to that
[39:55] word that word is mine amen and you let
[39:58] that word change your life amen that's
[40:00] that that's him coming into you amen
[40:03] then you can understand the kingdom then
[40:05] next slide it's got to be by revelation
[40:09] the kingdom of God is something that
[40:11] cannot be explained Jesus again speaking
[40:15] to Nicodemus and I like this this verse
[40:18] because at the time when I was studying
[40:20] this a couple of years ago III read this
[40:23] and got and God would just revealed this
[40:25] to me and and it was wonderful to me but
[40:28] Jesus tells Nicodemus that the wind
[40:31] blows where it listeth and and you and
[40:34] you hear the sound of it but you cannot
[40:36] tell where it comes or where it goes and
[40:40] so is every one that is born of the
[40:44] Spirit you see how he ties that in there
[40:49] the Holy Ghost is something that you
[40:51] cannot explain you like for example your
[40:54] outside you feel the wind and you hear
[40:57] it sometimes but maybe you cannot
[40:58] explain where it comes from or where it
[41:00] goes they meant but but you feel the
[41:02] effects of it and that's the same thing
[41:04] with the new birth amen
[41:06] you don't understand how it came you
[41:08] know what happened you just know that
[41:10] it's there because it's manifesting
[41:13] itself through your life amen and we'll
[41:16] look at this here just a moment next
[41:19] brother Brown says here verily verily I
[41:22] say unto you except a man be born again
[41:24] he cannot see the kingdom of God now you
[41:27] couldn't see the kingdom of God because
[41:28] the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit so
[41:32] I'm standing here will not taste the
[41:34] death till they see the kingdom of God
[41:35] coming in power he said next slide then
[41:39] the kingdom of God the Bible said is
[41:41] within you it's within you the Holy
[41:44] Spirit in you can't see that with your
[41:46] eyes so see means to understand I can't
[41:51] I can't show brother dawn and you know
[41:55] the Holy Ghost in me amen
[41:57] neither can you a man it's just it's
[42:00] shown it's by your fruits you shall know
[42:02] them the Bible says amen it's it's the
[42:08] only way you'll know that the kingdom is
[42:10] being established in your life next how
[42:15] many are still with me amen now that
[42:19] brother Brown says here now that
[42:21] translation there is really understand
[42:23] understand the kingdom of God the
[42:25] kingdom of God's within you so you
[42:27] couldn't actually see it lest you see it
[42:30] operating right that's the only way to
[42:32] see the kingdom but the only way you'll
[42:34] ever be able to understand it you've got
[42:36] to be born together again it's the only
[42:39] way next slide to be borned again you've
[42:43] been filled with God's Spirit then
[42:45] you're in Christ and when you're in
[42:46] Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the
[42:48] Bible that manifested Christ is in you
[42:51] to recognize his own self amen and his
[42:55] own self is the word and then again and
[42:59] the kingdom of God is the word now God's
[43:01] kingdom is not of this world and when
[43:03] Christ was here he give us the program
[43:05] of this kingdom he gave us the program
[43:07] of God's kingdom the father's kingdom
[43:09] which is his word now if you want to
[43:12] know how you get into that kingdom this
[43:14] words got it that it's it's through the
[43:18] word next trying to go quickly here
[43:22] now the kingdom of God is a mystery now
[43:24] revealed in mark chapter 4 you you in
[43:29] Luke 8:10 you see Jesus was telling his
[43:32] disciples until you it is given to know
[43:34] the mystery of the kingdom of God see
[43:36] they knew the mystery they maybe they
[43:39] knew though at that time but they had
[43:41] not experienced it it's one thing to
[43:44] know and one thing to experience amen
[43:46] until you it is given to know the
[43:48] mysteries of the kingdom of God Jesus
[43:49] would tell them and really they were
[43:53] they were predestinated to that but it
[43:56] wasn't at that time it wasn't until the
[43:58] new birth amen nextslide
[44:01] and Paul continue saying in Colossians
[44:04] even the mystery which hath been hid
[44:06] from ages and from generations but has
[44:08] now made manifested to his Saints
[44:10] so throughout all the ages throughout
[44:14] all the ages that the new birth that has
[44:16] come has come throughout all the ages
[44:18] that mystery has been made manifest to
[44:20] his Saints amen
[44:23] that's not that's not something that's
[44:25] not something new but it's something
[44:27] that we must experience which is the new
[44:29] birth which is Christ in you as
[44:32] paulkaiju said to whom god would make
[44:34] known what is the riches of the glory of
[44:36] this mystery among the gentiles which is
[44:38] christ in you the hope of glory see so
[44:42] it wasn't just Christ Christ in flesh
[44:47] just the body of Christ amen but now is
[44:50] that Christ in you living his life
[44:52] through you amen
[44:55] so that that's that's that's been
[44:59] experienced throughout all the church
[45:01] ages next slide
[45:02] but now when in revelations chapter ten
[45:05] verse seven and we are very familiar but
[45:07] of this verse but in the days of the
[45:09] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[45:10] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[45:14] be finished as he had declared to his
[45:17] servants the prophets now I say amen to
[45:19] that I believe that with all my heart
[45:22] but that's not where it stops because
[45:26] after that next verse a man you John had
[45:31] to go in and grab that mystery and
[45:33] get in and eat it again that goes back
[45:37] to you know the word and you know the
[45:39] message and you know the mysteries but
[45:41] that if that needs to be in you you need
[45:44] to experience that because what this is
[45:47] about how can I live closer to God how
[45:49] can I give this up in my life how can I
[45:51] stop doing this in my life you've got to
[45:53] have that word in you through the Holy
[45:55] Spirit manifesting they meant many of us
[45:59] even young people and children you know
[46:02] we've grown up in the word we've grown
[46:05] up learning this message from left and
[46:07] right and we know all the stories and
[46:09] the story of the possum and and and all
[46:12] those good things and that's wonderful
[46:14] and that's lovely but have you had an
[46:16] experience with God have you no is this
[46:19] word making you live closer to God is
[46:22] this word making you obey your parents
[46:24] is this word making you draw wondering
[46:27] put that desire in you amen to want to
[46:29] come to church to obey authority to obey
[46:36] yea those in charge amen
[46:39] praise God as he had declared to his
[46:42] servants the prophets
[46:44] nextslide and God said let us make man
[46:48] in our image after in Genesis 1:26 this
[46:53] spiritual Kingdom must now manifest
[46:54] itself in its fullness
[46:56] look what Genesis 1:26 brother Waits
[46:59] favorite scripture God said let us make
[47:03] man in our image after our likeness and
[47:04] let them have dominion over the fish of
[47:06] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[47:08] over the cattle and over all the earth
[47:09] and over every creeping thing that
[47:11] creepeth upon the earth and I believe
[47:14] this this is the Dominion that we lost
[47:18] we lost that I mean we have some sort of
[47:22] dominion over the cattle but but really
[47:26] still the cattle is kind of afraid of us
[47:29] the fish is afraid of us the birds are
[47:32] afraid of us and there's something that
[47:34] wants to connect with them but they're
[47:37] that that sin right there that thing
[47:39] Amen that that that broke that
[47:41] fellowship with that with the kingdom
[47:44] with that kingdom a man needs
[47:46] be back restored in our lives so again
[47:49] it has to start with a new birth it has
[47:52] to start with the Word of God in your
[47:54] life amen
[47:55] next brother Graham says here unless we
[47:59] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[48:01] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[48:05] for this is that character simply is
[48:07] never made without suffering see
[48:11] character is a victory not a gift a man
[48:14] without character can't reign because
[48:16] power apart from character is satanic
[48:20] that's why we we cannot rule over the
[48:24] this physical kingdom here on earth
[48:27] because some of us like that character
[48:30] some of us lack a man what that
[48:34] character a man in order to reign the
[48:37] way we need to reign the way God
[48:39] ordained it to be it from the beginning
[48:42] next slide I think it's a continuation
[48:46] of this but look what brother Branham
[48:47] says but power with character is fit to
[48:49] rule how do you get that power by the
[48:53] Holy Ghost amen
[48:55] and since he wants us to share even his
[48:58] throne on the same basis that he
[49:00] overcame and is set down in his Father's
[49:02] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[49:05] with him who do we overcome us
[49:10] I'm not overcoming I'm not all recommen
[49:13] Loren I'm not overcoming brother Don or
[49:15] brother Dale no I'm overcoming me I'm my
[49:18] own problem you are your own problem you
[49:22] are your worst enemy nextslide can't put
[49:27] it all on the devil can't blame it all
[49:30] on the devil this is we are the ones who
[49:33] God gave us free moral agency we're the
[49:35] ones who make decisions in life
[49:37] we're the ones who make the right
[49:38] decisions we make choices we make the
[49:41] right choices or we make wrong choices
[49:43] amen and just real quickly look what
[49:47] character means moral excellence and
[49:48] firmness and then in other words having
[49:52] the good characters the way you behave
[49:53] when others are not watching you how do
[49:57] you behave when others are not watching
[49:59] when you're not in
[50:00] how do you behave what attitude do you
[50:03] have what what what thoughts amen
[50:06] are they pointing you back to the word
[50:08] are your actress pointing back to your
[50:11] work to the word and if you don't know
[50:14] how to rule over your your earth your
[50:15] body how can you rule and reign over the
[50:18] planet Earth you see so you you have to
[50:23] have that Kingdom already spiritually
[50:25] established in you
[50:26] Amen that's what I'm trying to get to
[50:28] next oh I think they missed something
[50:32] there okay so I think oh I lift this out
[50:35] I'm sorry but this is where I was gonna
[50:37] have the statue of a perfect man that's
[50:40] why these virtues need to be established
[50:41] in the believers life after the kingdom
[50:43] has come into the believer a man see the
[50:48] those virtues our Holy Ghost virtues
[50:51] they're not your virtues you didn't come
[50:55] it is Earth with these virtues a man you
[50:59] have a little bit of faith and you have
[51:01] some some virtue and some knowledge some
[51:03] human knowledge and some temperance and
[51:06] some patience you know with one another
[51:08] I many of you you're not going to hold a
[51:09] job if you don't have patience with
[51:11] people you some godliness you know you
[51:14] can you can be good to others but there
[51:17] there is a difference between physical
[51:20] of human of those things and Holy Ghost
[51:24] of these virtues you see and the only
[51:26] way you can have these things forming in
[51:30] your life is that you've got to have the
[51:32] Word of God the Holy Ghost by the new
[51:35] birth in your life a true genuine Holy
[51:38] Ghost experience in your life amen
[51:42] again I'm saying these things to kind of
[51:45] simplify it amen for the for the younger
[51:47] ones as well
[51:48] amen next slide so I do apologize for
[51:51] the older ones that maybe I've already
[51:53] heard this that's alright it's good to
[51:55] hear it again because this is what the
[51:58] kingdom is about the kingdom in you will
[52:00] call forth a resurrection amen all of
[52:05] the subjects and poor takers of this
[52:06] kingdom must resurrect and complete
[52:08] fullness in other words that that life
[52:11] in you amen
[52:12] all of us amen
[52:13] well one day call out that the dead from
[52:16] the grave the dead Saints from the grave
[52:17] amen
[52:19] and it's not that we're standing up in
[52:21] our in a in a graveyard calling forth
[52:24] you know different names no a man it's
[52:26] just that that there's a pool there
[52:28] there's a pool there that that that the
[52:31] subjects of this kingdom must all be in
[52:33] fullness a man in order to meet the king
[52:36] amen praise God then we which are alive
[52:40] and remain shall be caught up with them
[52:42] and of course as we read in 1st
[52:43] Thessalonians 4 13 through 17 you see
[52:46] this is what this key so in order for
[52:48] you for this to be an experience a for
[52:51] you to experience this in your life you
[52:53] have to already have that Kingdom in me
[52:55] you see
[52:56] that's calling you to a physical Kingdom
[52:59] amen
[53:00] it's calling you because they're God's
[53:02] kingdom will be established here on
[53:04] earth physically but it's got to be in
[53:07] you first into in order to mold your
[53:10] character so that God can have complete
[53:13] confidence in you that you are going to
[53:15] be the Kings and the priests that God
[53:17] made you out to be amen because the
[53:20] Bible says that in the latter day
[53:21] there's gonna be kings and priests we're
[53:22] gonna we're made kings and priests
[53:24] amen next slide first Thessalonians 4:16
[53:30] 4:17 for the Lord himself shall descend
[53:32] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[53:34] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[53:36] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[53:38] first that has not been fulfilled yet
[53:43] that still needs to be fulfilled then we
[53:48] which are alive and remain shall be
[53:50] caught up together with them in the
[53:52] clouds to meet the Lord in the air that
[53:55] has not been fulfilled yet so again I
[53:58] say you and I are men are the ones to
[54:01] fulfill that in this time and I believe
[54:03] the hour is upon us I don't know about
[54:05] you amen but I feel that the coming of
[54:08] the Lord is soon at hand I feel I feel
[54:10] that and you know maybe he could be you
[54:12] another hundred years who knows but I'm
[54:15] gonna live my life like he's coming
[54:16] tomorrow
[54:18] amen I wanna I wanna pray like he's
[54:20] coming tomorrow and I want to read like
[54:22] he's coming tomorrow and I want to come
[54:23] to church like he's coming tomorrow I
[54:25] don't want to be caught doing something
[54:28] else and and doing my own thing amen and
[54:30] thinking that I'm gonna I'm gonna make
[54:32] it in no unfortunately there's people
[54:40] that are gonna be here they're gonna be
[54:41] left that has to be fulfilled as well
[54:45] that's a scripture that has to be
[54:47] fulfilled so make sure that you have the
[54:50] kingdom established in your heart it's
[54:53] not something hard not something
[54:55] difficult it's something that you just
[54:56] experience as you stay in the world you
[55:00] cannot explain it just stay in the word
[55:02] keep doing what you're supposed to do
[55:05] amen
[55:06] is that encouragement to you now keep
[55:09] doing what you're supposed to do
[55:10] amen to each one of us amen keep reading
[55:13] the word keep listening to the word and
[55:15] I believe as you're every little tape
[55:17] that you hear every word that you read
[55:19] every sermon that you put in that
[55:21] establishes you more and more into that
[55:24] kingdom or it better yet that kingdom
[55:26] establishes more and more than you it's
[55:29] not difficult amen
[55:31] next it's not difficult in the sense of
[55:34] that it that you know to explain it I
[55:38] mean you know you can but it's it's it's
[55:41] it's a life that it can be difficult
[55:44] it's hard to live because this thing
[55:47] gets in the way this is what gets in the
[55:49] way amen now Satan builds his kingdom
[55:56] with no sure foundation from the head
[55:58] down to the feet now if you remember
[56:00] this is Nebuchadnezzar statue in Daniel
[56:03] chapter 2 this is the dream that
[56:05] Nebuchadnezzar had and this is how how
[56:10] Satan how Satan establishes his kingdom
[56:13] from the head down to the feet in other
[56:17] words he starts from the head and goes
[56:20] down to the feet now you're really
[56:21] supposed to build from the ground up
[56:23] right all right but but he the way he
[56:26] starts is through the head in other
[56:29] words through knowledge human now
[56:31] human-human everything and see this is
[56:35] what I'm saying if you think that you
[56:37] can make it on your own in life you're
[56:39] going to crumble because we see later on
[56:42] in this in this in this vision that Rock
[56:46] a mint comes down and knocks it at its
[56:48] feet and completely demolishes it now
[56:50] there's a lot that goes on to this and
[56:52] there's that's a whole study within
[56:53] itself but I'm just trying to bring it
[56:55] to our life amen
[56:56] you see that's what Satan that's how
[56:59] Satan that's how and that's how all
[57:01] those kingdoms of this earth have been
[57:03] established because if it's Satan that
[57:06] established it it's gonna go it's gonna
[57:08] fall it's gonna crumble you
[57:10] it starts out heady highminded no
[57:12] humility whatsoever you see next slide
[57:17] but this is how Christ builds his
[57:19] kingdom and then from the feet to the
[57:22] head amen it has to start humble and
[57:27] meek and if you if you don't get
[57:31] humility in your life you're not gonna
[57:32] get anywhere in life the humility will
[57:36] draw you closer to God but if you're a
[57:38] proud heavy high-minded lover of
[57:41] pleasure more than lovers of life you're
[57:44] gonna crumble next slide no crumble just
[57:51] and what's gonna humble you is Jesus
[57:53] Christ right the rock it's coming down
[57:58] it's down in it that's what's gonna
[58:00] humble you and I don't want it to be
[58:02] that way young people I don't want it to
[58:04] be it doesn't have to be that way
[58:08] amen and that's why Kingdom that's why
[58:11] Satan's Kingdom will not stand and you
[58:14] see right now we're seeing these things
[58:15] coming together I mean it's been coming
[58:17] together all these kingdoms have been
[58:20] have have been destroyed the this is
[58:23] what's happening right now
[58:25] daddy Pope I don't know what's going on
[58:27] but he's on behind the scenes and then
[58:29] yeah there's no telling what's going on
[58:33] but it's going to crumble no matter no
[58:37] matter it's gonna crumble next slide
[58:42] Thanks
[58:43] cannot stand Daniel chapter 2 verse 35
[58:46] it says then was the iron the clay the
[58:49] brass the silver and the gold broken to
[58:51] pieces together and became like the
[58:54] Schaaf of the summer threshing floors
[58:56] and the wind carried them away that no
[58:58] place was found for them and the stone
[59:01] that smote the image became a great
[59:03] mountain and filled the whole earth amen
[59:12] hey man that's Christ that's what say
[59:16] Amen when that stone that stone hits
[59:19] your life that's what's going to stand
[59:22] it's going to form Christ in your life
[59:24] until you get hit by that stone they man
[59:27] you're not you're gonna do your own
[59:28] thing you've got to crumble that Christ
[59:33] may make me
[59:34] may the image of Christ may grow in you
[59:38] amen next slide now you see Daniel was
[59:43] seeing this Daniel was seeing that a
[59:45] physical kingdom was being established
[59:47] many many years ago see now that this
[59:51] kingdom that is being there was
[59:53] established in his Saints now it's going
[59:55] to come to fruition into full
[59:57] manifestation at some point Daniel 2:44
[1:00:00] and in the days of these kings those
[1:00:03] kings that there were named there in the
[1:00:05] statue shall the God of heaven set up a
[1:00:08] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[1:00:11] now let me tell you what in the days of
[1:00:13] this kings in other words while those
[1:00:16] ages were coming God was setting up up
[1:00:18] and kingdom in people's hearts God was
[1:00:22] setting up his kingdom - Satan was
[1:00:26] setting up his kingdom but God was
[1:00:28] setting up his kingdom in the hearts of
[1:00:29] man in unseen Kingdom and what who's the
[1:00:33] one that ends up winning and the Kingdom
[1:00:35] shall not be left to other people but it
[1:00:38] shall break in pieces and consume all
[1:00:41] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:00:42] forever the kingdom of God next slide
[1:00:47] but the RAM says here we're almost
[1:00:50] finished enough God already took up his
[1:00:52] abode potentially all right the kingdom
[1:00:55] of God is in the earth now
[1:00:57] right right now in the heart of his
[1:01:01] Saints amen
[1:01:03] it's his attributes that he began in the
[1:01:06] beginning now his attributes is redeemed
[1:01:09] what's he waiting to redeem the earth to
[1:01:13] say his attributes on it that's you and
[1:01:16] I amen
[1:01:17] to fulfill exactly his predestinated
[1:01:20] plan so it wasn't just about coming to
[1:01:23] church he wasn't just about reading the
[1:01:25] Bible it wasn't a man it's God
[1:01:28] manifesting himself walking on this
[1:01:30] earth ruling over creation ruling over
[1:01:34] the animal kingdom ruling over
[1:01:35] everything amen exactly the way Adam did
[1:01:38] except we probably have it greater than
[1:01:41] because we have we're Adam then it was
[1:01:43] an eternal in his flesh amen
[1:01:46] we would have eternal life in our flesh
[1:01:48] amen as well
[1:01:50] praise God next slide then our headship
[1:01:54] is a kingdom the kingdom of God is
[1:01:57] within you said the Bible Jesus the
[1:01:59] kingdom we are not a denomination we
[1:02:01] belong to a kingdom and the Kingdom is
[1:02:03] the word of God made spirit and life in
[1:02:06] our own life amen they're hitting the
[1:02:10] kingdom coming in plain view next slide
[1:02:13] oh this is the continuation of that
[1:02:16] quote bringing to pass every promise in
[1:02:19] this day as it did in that day when the
[1:02:21] word and God was one and the word in God
[1:02:24] is one in his church today making it the
[1:02:26] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:02:28] bring the message in the last day and be
[1:02:30] taken up from the dead that's what's
[1:02:34] coming next in the resurrection to go
[1:02:37] back and restore again as Adam and Eve
[1:02:39] in the beginning in the Garden of Eden
[1:02:43] that's that's the that's the whole plan
[1:02:46] that God had in mind amen
[1:02:48] next slide so I say Saints seek ye first
[1:02:55] the kingdom of God that's why Jesus said
[1:02:57] seek first the kingdom of God in
[1:03:00] everything that you do seek him first in
[1:03:03] every plan that you have seek him first
[1:03:07] this goes from the adult to the younger
[1:03:09] one here
[1:03:10] everything that you do seek the kingdom
[1:03:12] of God first
[1:03:13] Jesus himself commanded us to seek the
[1:03:16] kingdom of God it wasn't just a
[1:03:18] something that he just you know it
[1:03:21] wasn't a suggestion it was a commandment
[1:03:24] seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:03:29] righteousness and look and all these
[1:03:31] things all these jobs all these houses
[1:03:37] all these cars all these marriages all
[1:03:40] these things amen all the things that
[1:03:43] you want in life shall be added unto you
[1:03:48] seeking the kingdom of God first is the
[1:03:51] most important thing it's the most a
[1:03:54] essential thing that you must do amen
[1:03:57] above anything else and and let me just
[1:04:02] simplify what is seeking the kingdom of
[1:04:04] God first it's putting God in first
[1:04:06] place in everything everything in your
[1:04:08] life you have the option to do something
[1:04:12] else a man is and come to church I come
[1:04:15] to church you have the option to - to do
[1:04:19] something else or pray I pray you have
[1:04:22] the option they meant to go spend time
[1:04:24] with your mom or go spend time with your
[1:04:26] dad or go spend time with your with your
[1:04:28] with your brothers and sisters instead
[1:04:29] of coming to church I'll go I'll go to
[1:04:31] church that's just an example of seeking
[1:04:35] the kingdom of God first and when that
[1:04:37] is not manifested in your life then we
[1:04:39] just know who is in first place in your
[1:04:40] life it's you and it's not the kingdom
[1:04:44] next slide
[1:04:46] Luke 18 28 verse 30 then Peter said lo
[1:04:50] we have left all and followed thee see
[1:04:54] they they left everything and followed
[1:04:56] you and look what Jesus was blessing me
[1:04:58] he said unto them verily I say unto you
[1:04:59] there is no man that hath left house or
[1:05:02] parents or brethren or wife or children
[1:05:05] for the kingdom of God's sake who shall
[1:05:09] not receive manifold more in this
[1:05:11] present time in other words you're gonna
[1:05:13] be rewarded for that decision here in
[1:05:16] this life
[1:05:17] in this life you're going to receive
[1:05:19] results and you're going to receive
[1:05:21] rewards for making the right choices to
[1:05:23] seek the kingdom of God first and the
[1:05:27] world and not just in this present time
[1:05:29] but in the world to come life
[1:05:30] everlasting so it pays to seek the
[1:05:34] kingdom of God amen
[1:05:36] next slide I think I think all right so
[1:05:41] we're just this I think is the closing
[1:05:43] slides I want you to read this with me
[1:05:45] this is what we opened with and let's
[1:05:47] close with this Matthew 6 verse 9
[1:05:50] through 13 after this manner therefore
[1:05:52] pray ye our Father which are in heaven
[1:05:55] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:05:59] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:06:03] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[1:06:06] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:06:10] our debtors and lead us not into
[1:06:14] temptation but deliver us from evil for
[1:06:17] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:06:21] the glory forever amen
[1:06:25] praise the Lord when you have the
[1:06:28] kingdom of God in you you you read that
[1:06:30] difference you read that different I
[1:06:33] think that's it so to see the Lord's
[1:06:35] Prayer is the bride's prayer amen
[1:06:40] the Lord that's that's that's the Bride
[1:06:44] of God's prayer that's because you have
[1:06:46] the Lord inside you have the kingdom in
[1:06:49] you that will manifest on it on the
[1:06:52] outside man I did pretty good
[1:06:54] I thought I was just gonna be that was
[1:06:56] it right brother's not like they can
[1:07:04] that was 50 slides and I'm like home I
[1:07:07] couldn't as I'm gonna be keeping them
[1:07:08] till 9 but praise God
[1:07:11] you know I mean I just didn't go through
[1:07:13] a much jibber-jabber
[1:07:15] but Saints young people listen this is
[1:07:21] this is again like I preached last time
[1:07:23] the hour that we're living in now I want
[1:07:26] to say this things are gonna get worse
[1:07:29] I mean they're already saying that
[1:07:31] things are gonna get worse and whether
[1:07:32] you believe it's a conspiracy or not
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] it's gonna get worse all right things
[1:07:38] are gonna get bad it's time for us to
[1:07:42] really like I said last time get shut in
[1:07:44] if God and really man it really seek out
[1:07:50] this kingdom in your life because what
[1:07:52] what does it matter for you to go in and
[1:07:55] and do everything else and forget about
[1:07:57] God when this world is dying and it's
[1:08:01] falling apart at this very moment that
[1:08:03] you're living at this very moment that
[1:08:05] you're living is crumbling into pieces
[1:08:07] man can't get their story straight and
[1:08:09] this guy you cannot put any any trust in
[1:08:13] governments you cannot put the trust in
[1:08:15] in any man in this earth only in what
[1:08:19] God said in his word for you to just go
[1:08:25] on the side and say look I'll just do it
[1:08:27] later you do not know if you have later
[1:08:29] in your life you do not know there is no
[1:08:32] guarantee that you have tomorrow so why
[1:08:35] don't you do what you can today again
[1:08:39] it's my plea amen to each one of us amen
[1:08:41] to do the first works over you lost your
[1:08:44] first love go back to your first love
[1:08:46] amen you love you wherever you left God
[1:08:49] that's where you're gonna find him if
[1:08:52] you left them in your prayer life that's
[1:08:53] where you're gonna find him go back into
[1:08:55] prayer if you left him and come into
[1:08:57] church go back to coming to church amen
[1:08:59] if you left them in it whatever way you
[1:09:01] left him that's where you'll find him
[1:09:03] that's where you're gonna find him
[1:09:05] waiting for you it's not time for us to
[1:09:09] get consumed with what we want to do and
[1:09:11] forget God
[1:09:13] it's time for us to seek the kingdom of
[1:09:16] God first listen I have plans I still
[1:09:19] have things that I want to do and I
[1:09:21] wonder I want to be able to fulfill I
[1:09:22] want to be able to Amen but I put this
