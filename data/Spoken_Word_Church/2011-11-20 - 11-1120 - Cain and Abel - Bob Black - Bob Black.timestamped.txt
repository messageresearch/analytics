[0:00] she says all is well and they're giving
[0:02] her medicine and running tests but she's
[0:05] at home today because of the medicine
[0:06] they're giving her and she said she got
[0:08] a little bit of a stubborn Spirit about
[0:10] not able to take the medicine and so she
[0:12] listened to for the baby in brother
[0:14] Rayner preached why and at the end
[0:16] somewhere in the tape he said some some
[0:19] people get such a stubborn attitude when
[0:21] the doctor gives them medicine they
[0:22] don't want to take it
[0:24] so she said I'm taking the medicine now
[0:26] but I don't want to
[0:28] um but anyway she's she says all is well
[0:31] but she just needs prayer for her faith
[0:33] and sanctification for the medicine and
[0:35] all is well
[0:40] and found out what it was no not yet
[0:42] they're still looking for the reason
[0:45] oh man
[0:52] all right
[0:57] last time we uh we continued on looking
[1:00] through Genesis
[1:01] Genesis chapter four
[1:03] and I think we made it to
[1:07] we were on the first five
[1:18] Genesis chapter four
[1:26] let's go ahead and read through those
[1:28] verses I'm I'm probably only going to
[1:30] get to maybe verse 10 today so let's go
[1:33] ahead and read through those just to
[1:34] pick up where we were
[1:36] Adam knew Eve his wife if she could see
[1:38] the bear came and said I have gotten a
[1:40] man from the Lord
[1:42] but she again buries brother Abel Abel
[1:44] was a keeper of sheep Cain was the
[1:46] daughter of the ground and in process of
[1:47] time it came to pass that came brought
[1:49] on the fruit of the ground and offered
[1:51] him to hold
[1:52] and Abel he also brought the first
[1:54] things of his Flocka and the Lord had
[1:56] respect of Abel and to hit to his
[1:58] offering but unto cane into his offering
[2:00] he had not respected and Cain was very
[2:02] Roth and his countenance failed
[2:05] so last time we were talking about how
[2:07] um
[2:08] staple brought his sacrificed by faith
[2:11] and God Vindicated the sacrifice that it
[2:13] was true that his message that you must
[2:16] bring a sacrifice was true and then we
[2:19] started talking about how God Vindicated
[2:20] the prophet's message and how he
[2:22] Vindicated a Believer and um we were
[2:25] looking at uh just kind of
[2:27] taken the story of how Rahab saw the
[2:30] children of Israel coming out of the
[2:31] Wilderness and she saw the pillar of
[2:33] Fire coming first and how the pillar of
[2:36] fire leads the believer and have
[2:37] indicated a Prophet by you know it was a
[2:41] photograph was taken on the pillar of
[2:42] fire and then the next thing we were
[2:45] going to look at was the Ark of the
[2:46] Covenant which is the word the spirit
[2:48] leading the word and the spirit of the
[2:51] word uh
[2:52] leading the believer so let's um
[2:58] let me get my quotes now the way
[3:02] there's there's lots of ways that you
[3:04] could say how brother bearings have
[3:05] indicated about the all the all the
[3:07] different the many wonderful amazing
[3:08] things but um
[3:11] you know Christ was revealed in
[3:13] Simplicity and what a lot of people
[3:15] overlooked is that a true prophet and a
[3:18] True Believer are both Vindicated
[3:20] because they stay with the word
[3:23] and uh you know when Joshua told the
[3:26] children originally when they were
[3:27] crossing the river Jordan
[3:29] stay close to the heart because you
[3:31] haven't gone this way before
[3:34] so um
[3:35] you know we're we're crossing uh the
[3:38] River Jordan the Rapture too and uh it's
[3:42] it's crucial to stay close to the word
[3:45] because we haven't gone this way before
[3:49] um so let me just read some quotes from
[3:51] brother and said the size of his tummy
[3:53] he said but the true prophet
[3:55] how you'll Mark him he will stay with
[3:57] the word always
[3:59] the president stays in my Ministry he
[4:02] said
[4:03] he was talking about Paul now everything
[4:04] forsaken him Paul
[4:06] but it was at this time that God stepped
[4:09] in on the scene because any man that
[4:10] knows the word will stay with the word
[4:12] knowing that the word is God
[4:15] and God's power to transform he said
[4:17] True predestinated Believers will stay
[4:19] with the word because they are part of
[4:21] that order
[4:26] and one as he said
[4:32] that's when he said in his church that's
[4:33] what he said he would do believes the
[4:35] word not the Creed not the Dogma but the
[4:38] word and by doing this he shows himself
[4:40] in them by confirming his word making
[4:42] the same life that he lived once live
[4:45] over again bring his word to pass
[4:49] and I just
[4:51] I was thinking about you know how God
[4:55] through brother Brandon he revealed to
[4:57] us the Mysteries that are in the Bible
[4:59] so they could be revealed at us
[5:03] oh he got he was the prophet was
[5:06] identified in the scripture and we are
[5:09] identified in this scripture because
[5:10] what's written in the scripture has to
[5:12] come to pass in our lives
[5:14] what's predicted in the scripture about
[5:16] him
[5:17] he the scripture predicted that they
[5:19] would have Prophet a prophet would come
[5:21] on the scene in Malachi 4 and Revelation
[5:24] 10 7 all the many scriptures we know but
[5:27] also predicted that there'll be people
[5:28] that would believe it and I I was
[5:31] reading the scripture where he said the
[5:32] same Pillar of Fire the same God that
[5:34] led you led me here to preach to you
[5:36] tonight is the same God that leads you
[5:38] here to hear me
[5:44] um
[5:45] so we're we're identified with the
[5:47] message
[5:49] five different identifications of the
[5:51] True Church of the Living God he said
[5:53] somebody had seen him somebody was
[5:55] trying to tell him about it and they did
[5:56] not believe it if that isn't the same
[5:58] thing today we know he lives
[6:00] we have the witness of your spirit in us
[6:02] we see his power move over the audiences
[6:04] and tens of thousands of people discern
[6:07] their thoughts thoughts and hearts just
[6:08] exactly like he did
[6:10] when he was here
[6:12] like the Bible said the word of God if
[6:14] he is the word of God in the beginning
[6:15] was the word and the Word was with God
[6:17] and the world was made flesh and grown
[6:18] Among Us the word of God is sharper more
[6:20] powerful than a two-way sword
[6:22] cutting even to the mirror of the bone
[6:24] and discern of the thoughts and intense
[6:25] of the heart
[6:27] Christ The Works that I do show you also
[6:30] see him doing that how many seen him do
[6:32] it sure we know he doesn't he lives here
[6:34] he's in our hearts
[6:36] you know I I believe a real True
[6:40] Believer when they
[6:41] when they hear something
[6:43] if if maybe you don't understand that
[6:45] you'll always take it back to the word
[6:47] that's what brother Brown said when an
[6:48] angel came and when the angel came and
[6:50] told him something he didn't just say
[6:52] okay that's the truth he took it back
[6:54] and proved it by the word right that's
[6:56] that's the a Vindication of a True
[6:58] Believer is not just saying yeah that's
[7:00] that's the truth but let me go prove it
[7:12] why I'm against organized release and he
[7:15] said now look this message of the day
[7:17] just can't be something saying we got
[7:18] the truth and we got this that it has to
[7:21] be foretold in his word
[7:23] and then after the word is brought forth
[7:25] it has to be properly Vindicated by the
[7:27] word
[7:29] why I'm against organized organized
[7:31] religion now if you go to The
[7:32] Seventh-Day Adventists say we got her
[7:34] just keep the Sabbath you show me that
[7:36] in the scriptures
[7:38] Miss Eddie baker said she had it show it
[7:40] to me
[7:41] Jehovah Witness said they had to show it
[7:43] to me see methodists say they got it
[7:45] show it to me Baptists say they got it
[7:48] show it to me show me any organizations
[7:50] I'm proving to you that they are every
[7:52] one out of the will of God every one of
[7:54] them contrary teaching traditions of man
[7:56] instead of the word of God
[7:58] I don't know one of them that would
[8:00] accept the things that's really written
[8:02] in the Bible the way it is that's right
[8:03] but when somebody comes by and said I
[8:06] got the message of the day he must
[8:08] properly be seen first and foretold to
[8:11] come
[8:13] when John the Baptist walked out there
[8:15] they said are you the Christ he said I'm
[8:16] not
[8:17] said are you the Elijah he said I'm not
[8:19] he said who are you he could identify
[8:21] himself he had the message of the hour
[8:23] he said I'm the voice of one crying in
[8:25] the wilderness
[8:29] the word identifies the prophet the
[8:32] messenger and it identifies the believer
[8:35] persevere he said why it was the word
[8:38] that was in him God's word for that day
[8:40] see that's how they were Vindicated that
[8:42] was their credentials none of them
[8:44] belonged to an organization not one
[8:46] never did their credentials was their
[8:47] Ministry
[8:51] a prisoner he said
[8:54] people say it was a mental telepathy who
[8:57] would refuse such to come into their
[8:58] church and everybody permit you to
[9:00] mention one word of serpency eternal
[9:03] security and the things that the Holy
[9:04] Spirit has revealed and proved to be the
[9:06] word I mean challenge after challenge to
[9:08] come and prove this to be wrong
[9:12] they are um
[9:14] this uh this next quote from thirst
[9:19] I'm trying to move a little bit faster
[9:21] okay
[9:25] you know uh
[9:27] I'm about to share something a little
[9:29] personal with you this is kind of scary
[9:31] sometimes but I
[9:33] I want a few years ago the lord gave me
[9:35] a dream where
[9:36] I was talking to somebody about the
[9:39] the word and in the dream I saw um they
[9:43] were telling me something wrong
[9:45] and I saw that groom in my heart and uh
[9:49] out of the side
[9:50] arm came with a hammer and every time
[9:52] that would speak that arm would swing
[9:54] and hit that drum and it would go bloop
[9:56] Bloom like it wasn't sounding it was it
[9:59] was wrong in my dream I said that's not
[10:02] right
[10:03] because it doesn't work their record
[10:06] what's in my heart
[10:12] and I always wondered if that dream was
[10:14] true
[10:15] until I read this I heard brother Brown
[10:18] say this quote
[10:20] from thirst
[10:28] and then I thought comparing the deer
[10:30] with a man that's thirsting for God
[10:32] before the enemy gets there
[10:35] is something about a child of God that
[10:37] when you once are born into the spirit
[10:38] of God receive the baptism of the Holy
[10:41] Spirit there is something about the
[10:43] person that can sense the enemy
[10:47] you can take a man when he's taking the
[10:48] scripture and reading this scripture and
[10:51] try to inject something to that script
[10:52] this this contrary to the scripture a
[10:55] man that's filled the Holy Ghost can
[10:57] sense that right quick
[10:59] there's something out of the way when he
[11:01] gets into a place and that little
[11:03] certain sense in there that it's done to
[11:05] protect your life you mustn't you must
[11:07] never go for anything unless it's
[11:09] exactly the word of God
[11:11] you must stay right exactly with that
[11:13] word
[11:14] and now and we are secured with that
[11:16] sense as long as we are in the Holy
[11:17] Spirit
[11:19] now then you find a person get up there
[11:22] and say now that was for the apostolic
[11:23] age that now right quick if you ever see
[11:26] the Holy Spirit you've been endowed with
[11:27] that sins it sets it off there's
[11:30] something wrong there
[11:32] see they try to explain it away it is
[11:34] for another day that really you don't
[11:35] need those things today
[11:37] but Jesus said these things shall follow
[11:39] them to believe see there's a little
[11:41] something sits off in you a little
[11:43] buzzer and knowing that that's wrong and
[11:45] that's the way of this
[11:47] because Jesus said if we have one word
[11:49] to this or take one word from our part
[11:52] that's taken out of the Book of Life
[11:54] see not one scripture we must take it
[11:56] just the way it's written
[11:57] and God watches over his word to perform
[12:00] it and we know that it's got to be just
[12:02] right so therefore no matter what a
[12:05] church would say what anyone else would
[12:07] say if you're born of the spirit of God
[12:09] you become part of the Bible God told
[12:11] Ezekiel he the prophet he said take the
[12:13] scroll and eat it then the prophet and
[12:15] the scroll became part of each other and
[12:17] that's the believer when he receives the
[12:18] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the
[12:21] Bible and the spirit of God is the word
[12:23] of God
[12:24] my words are Spirit In the Beginning was
[12:27] the word and the Word was with God and
[12:28] the Word was God and the world was made
[12:30] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[12:32] he is the same yesterday today and
[12:34] forever and when you are part of that
[12:36] word oh then let something come up
[12:38] contrary to that word there is a little
[12:40] buzzer sets off right quick
[12:42] it's just a warn you that death is in
[12:44] the road we should never do that
[12:46] there's also these that thirsts are just
[12:48] natural they are natural for the
[12:49] Christian they are natural for the human
[12:52] being
[12:53] so God gives us a little something to
[12:57] tell us when something is wrong and then
[13:00] when you hear something wrong you go
[13:01] back to the word and prove it because
[13:03] that's the Vindication of a True
[13:05] Believer he's going to take it back to
[13:06] the word and prove it just like brother
[13:08] random every time that angel would come
[13:10] he'd go back to the word and prove it
[13:12] now the next thing
[13:14] imagine Rahab looking out her window
[13:16] she's seeing the children of Israel
[13:17] coming out of the Wilderness the pillar
[13:19] of fires leading the Ark of the
[13:20] covenants with them all the children of
[13:22] Israel were gathered around the ark
[13:24] guarding it
[13:25] Matthew Martin Luke and John all around
[13:27] it coming out
[13:29] and then behind them
[13:31] comes the signs and wonders
[13:36] and they had
[13:38] they had an atonement a rock that was
[13:41] cleft they had the Brazen serpent that
[13:45] was a type of sand already judged
[13:48] and you know all the
[13:50] people think signs and wonders a lot of
[13:52] times are kind of like a magic trick but
[13:55] God gives us things when we need them
[13:56] their clothes never brought it off
[13:58] because they needed their clothes
[14:00] he gave them water out of that rock
[14:01] because they needed it all right the
[14:04] things that they had Nico he provided
[14:12] the faith that was once delivered to the
[14:14] Saints
[14:16] his Vindication was there his power was
[14:18] there there was a smitten Rock a brass
[14:20] Circle an atonement going before them
[14:22] with a sign of God other than what signs
[14:24] and wonders
[14:25] the same thing from Cain and Abel now
[14:28] not fundamental fundamental two but
[14:30] signs of following the Believers these
[14:32] signs shall follow them that believe
[14:36] ERS always have signs and wonders among
[14:38] them Jesus said in Saint Mark the 16th
[14:41] chapter these signs shall follow them to
[14:43] the end of the world
[14:44] they that believe and is baptized shall
[14:47] be saved he that believeth or not shall
[14:49] be damned these signs shall follow them
[14:51] that believe
[14:53] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[14:55] speak with new tongues if they take up
[14:57] serpents or drink deadly things it'll
[14:59] not harm them if they lay hands on the
[15:01] sick they shall recover
[15:02] and today the churches you preach that
[15:04] Doctrine they take the confirmation as a
[15:06] man that goes to church and they require
[15:08] a religious type of man
[15:10] Pays His ties a quarter to the church
[15:12] believes in the church
[15:14] brother that's no sign at all that's the
[15:16] world sign but God's sign is what he
[15:19] said it was
[15:29] and you know brother Branham had signs
[15:31] he had the two the two signs that were
[15:33] given as a witness
[15:35] the sign in the hand uh the sign of
[15:37] discernment and then
[15:40] you know he talked about how Moses had
[15:42] two sons also but the third sign was a
[15:46] lie to the believer and death to the
[15:48] unbeliever and you know if you look at
[15:51] Deuteronomy
[15:53] and I like this the word Deuteronomy
[15:56] means two laws
[15:58] if you obey God you live if you disobey
[16:01] God you die
[16:03] and we can see those two laws all the
[16:05] way from the beginning and eaten
[16:08] and in a second if we have time we'll
[16:11] take it all the way to emphasis to the
[16:13] Ephesian churches let's see what
[16:15] happened there but first let's go back
[16:17] to the Genesis story verse six
[16:32] and the Lord said unto King
[16:35] why are there a Roth and why is that
[16:38] counting Us Falling
[16:40] if thou do us well shall not be accepted
[16:43] and after I do it's not well
[16:45] send lines at the door and unto thee
[16:48] shall be his desire and thou shall rule
[16:50] over him
[16:53] now
[16:56] let's kind of split this up without
[16:58] taking a piece at a time if thou do us
[17:01] well shall thou not be accepted
[17:03] and if thou doest not well sin life at
[17:06] the door
[17:07] now remember Cain had seen the fire of
[17:12] God fall on the evil sacrifice
[17:14] he saw it and just like in this day
[17:18] we've seen the Vindicated proof that
[17:21] this is true we've seen the other
[17:23] believers around us that their their
[17:25] testimony is true
[17:27] right and uh
[17:29] so let's just see what Robert has to say
[17:32] about this
[17:33] Divine Healing
[17:36] now he that willfully he that sins
[17:40] and what is sin unbelief
[17:43] he that will turn his back on Truth when
[17:45] it's presented to him there remaineth no
[17:47] more sacrifice for sin
[17:49] did you ever read it like that he that
[17:52] disbelieves the willfully after truth
[17:53] has been present to him because his
[17:55] church believes different
[17:56] that's when you cross the line
[17:59] he that sins a willfully after he has
[18:00] received the knowledge of the truth
[18:01] there remaineth no more sacrifice
[18:04] that's because you've seen the sacrifice
[18:06] you've seen it right there in front of
[18:08] me and you turn your back on and say I
[18:10] don't I don't want
[18:12] there's no more sacrifice because that
[18:13] is a sacrifice
[18:19] God's power to transform
[18:22] he said why didn't why are you looking
[18:24] like that said if you'll do well
[18:27] go do like your brother is doing out
[18:29] there I'll receive you and bless you
[18:31] I'll do for you the same thing
[18:34] think about it he'll give you the same
[18:37] Holy Ghost baptism he'll give you the
[18:39] same leading of the Holy Spirit the word
[18:41] and you revealing the signs and wonders
[18:43] falling
[18:45] that's not in the quote but he just
[18:48] couldn't do it he said now if you don't
[18:50] sin of unbelief lies at the door
[18:53] God's power to transform but you see
[18:57] now notice what that done to Cain and
[18:59] it's going to do the same today and make
[19:01] Cain go away on will for willful sinner
[19:04] he willfully was disobedient
[19:07] every person will be the same way
[19:10] willfully disobedient after he had seen
[19:12] Abel's message so Vindicated of God that
[19:14] it was the truth and refused to do it
[19:17] done the same then then he crossed the
[19:19] dividing line
[19:21] now everybody's got a dividing line
[19:22] because God is such a gentleman that
[19:24] he'll call you and call you but if you
[19:26] turn it away he's very polite and he
[19:29] won't override your freedom on ways
[19:31] that's right
[19:34] that dream
[19:40] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[19:43] thou shalt rule over him
[19:55] how is their normal sacrifice
[19:59] because
[20:02] and brother Brian gives the example of
[20:04] that preacher who
[20:05] just Dives quickly yeah I remember the
[20:08] story of the uh I think it was he said
[20:12] Abraham Lincoln gave the pardon and the
[20:15] Man in the prison wouldn't he turned
[20:17] down the pardon and so they went ahead
[20:20] and uh executed it so if you turn down
[20:22] the pardon
[20:23] you rejected the pardon there's nothing
[20:26] that can be done for you because you've
[20:28] turned it down and you just paid to pay
[20:31] the sacrifice once for all for us all
[20:33] but he's not going to force any of us to
[20:35] receive it right
[20:37] right that's right
[20:46] now the question a lot of people when
[20:49] they were receiving the Holy Ghost
[20:50] looking to receive it I talked to a lot
[20:53] of young people that feel this way as
[20:54] the devil will tell you you send away
[20:56] your day of Grace
[20:58] and how did you know if you send away
[21:00] your day of Grace it's very simple if
[21:02] you don't want to come to Jesus
[21:05] you send away your day of Grace
[21:08] um
[21:09] I don't know if I I was looking at a
[21:12] quote and I had that quote in here was
[21:14] talking about a young lady and he said
[21:16] October
[21:18] that
[21:19] um
[21:20] if anybody needs that I'll I'll be back
[21:22] oh
[21:27] I know to leave shall be his desire and
[21:29] thou shalt rule over him now in the New
[21:31] Testament we heard how Jesus was telling
[21:34] Peter Satan desires to Sifty like wheat
[21:37] but I prayed for you and this is really
[21:40] the same kind of thing if you if you
[21:42] will do like your brother
[21:44] then you'll roll over sin and death and
[21:46] Satan because you know
[21:49] if you're on God's side or Satan can't
[21:52] do one thing against you without the
[21:54] Lord's permission
[22:08] in chapter eight I mean sorry verse
[22:10] eight in chain talk with Abel his
[22:12] brother and it came to pass when they
[22:14] were in the field that Cain rose up
[22:16] against Abel his brother and slew him
[22:20] now
[22:21] what did Abel say to Cain
[22:25] let's turn to John chapter 8.
[22:29] and I this is probably won't be as far
[22:31] as
[22:36] yeah
[22:37] John chapter 8.
[22:43] verse 31.
[22:48] now I I just you know
[22:52] Jesus was the second Adam
[22:55] that said to correct all of the things
[22:58] that Adam brought into the world and I
[23:01] just imagined that the conversation must
[23:04] have gone like this because
[23:06] he's talking to
[23:09] well let's just read
[23:12] it then said Jesus to those Jews which
[23:14] believed on him
[23:16] if you continue in my word
[23:18] then argue my disciples indeed dislike
[23:21] he told to Abel come do like or told the
[23:25] Cain come do like your brother Abel if
[23:27] you'll believe on my word and do
[23:30] then you'll uh be accepted and you shall
[23:33] know the truth and the truth shall make
[23:34] you free
[23:36] they answered him we be Abraham's seed
[23:38] and we're never in bondage to any man
[23:39] how safe is thy you shall be made free
[23:42] and that was always people are always
[23:43] looking for genealogy to proved by your
[23:45] learnings that you're saying but we're
[23:48] not saved by Adam seed he got us into
[23:50] this man we're Saved By the Sea of the
[23:52] woman which is Christ
[23:54] Jesus answered them verily verily I say
[23:57] unto you whosoever committed sin is the
[24:00] serpent of sin there's serpency right
[24:02] there
[24:05] of sin and the sermon abideth not in the
[24:08] house forever but the son abideth ever
[24:11] if the sun therefore shall make you free
[24:13] ye shall be free indeed
[24:16] I know that you're Abraham City but you
[24:19] seek to kill me because my word hath no
[24:21] place in you
[24:22] I speak that which I have seen with my
[24:24] father and you do that which you have
[24:26] seen with your father
[24:28] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[24:30] is our father
[24:31] Jesus saith unto them if you were
[24:33] Abraham's children you would do the
[24:34] works of Abraham
[24:36] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[24:38] hath told you the truth which I have
[24:40] heard of God this did not Abraham you do
[24:43] the Deeds of your father then said they
[24:46] to him we be not born of fornication we
[24:48] have one father even God
[24:50] now
[24:52] a lot of people don't know this but the
[24:54] Jews have a history of teaching serpent
[24:56] seat they actually if you look back at
[24:58] what the early rabbis from uh about 2000
[25:02] years ago or whatever their writings
[25:03] they taught that there were two atoms
[25:05] one with a soul and one without a soul
[25:07] and uh
[25:09] we don't have time to get all into that
[25:11] but they so that's they're telling them
[25:14] we know by this servancy business and
[25:18] we've been I've won a fornication we
[25:19] have one father even God
[25:21] Jesus said unto them of God we're your
[25:24] father and you would love me for I
[25:25] proceeded forth and came from God
[25:27] neither came out of myself but he sent
[25:30] me
[25:30] why do you not understand my speech even
[25:33] because you cannot hear my word
[25:35] year of your father the devil and the
[25:37] lust of your father you will do he was a
[25:40] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[25:41] not in the truth because there's no
[25:43] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[25:46] speaketh of his own he is a liar and the
[25:48] father of it and because I tell you the
[25:50] truth Believe Me Not
[25:53] and we're at 25 minutes after the hour
[25:56] so I go ahead and stop right now
