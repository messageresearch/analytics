TRANSCRIPT
========================================
BL you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord I'm excited for What the Lord Has in stay store for us today let's uh see if this works there we go I want to start off just we've been kind of meditating on what um Paul was talking about with uh the the sacrifice that Christ made and how we're identified with that sacrifice and we've got to give ourselves up I'm just looking at this um quote that brother Ram said in the message the token where he said a lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't take claim its own can lay it right down and Shear the wool off of it that's the only thing that's got so I just as we're studying these scriptures this morning just kind of uh think about the attributes of a Christian and the attributes of you know when you're living out in the world and you're not saved you you want things done for you you want to take you want you know you start you're living from a more selfish perspective but a Christian it changes everything instead of taking you're giving and look at this little lamb just like Christ died on the cross he gave instead of taking he was giving and a lamb a little that Christian nature is is just it's just going to give out and that's that's that's really you start identifying like uh that sermon that brother R preached the serment of spirits he talked about how that uh uh the spirit of God when it's manifested in a Believer it's just going to act out the nature of Christ and there's the nature of Christ being acted out that that lamb they like a dove a lamb just real just real simple and um and humble and just it's just making wool it's just giving out you you come and take the wool off of it get some laneline get all the things that it's given out just natural and he said it never never says anything about it just sacrifices everything as God that's a lamb even you know Monica talks about how when she was growing up they she's got that story of how her family would kill all the Lambs they'd have the lamb killing day and she'd wake up in the middle of the night with the lamb laying on the you know the the kitchen table and she'd look up there and see the Lambs there but to the lamb the lamb would just that they just bite their tongue and they don't make any sound when they're being killed they just they just give it up they they not struggle and that's what lamb of that Christian nature just just ready to give and and give to somebody else now see there's the difference between that worldly nature wants to take from everybody but a Christian nature is about living for others there's Christianity is living for others doing for others always putting the other first and that's what real humility is that's what real uh all the things that you can trace out through the scripture real Christianity is for others that's a lamb it gives everything it gives everything away itself and all it is so as we study out what Paul said about uh uh sacrifice let's let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we study these things out Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning today and Lord to look into these things and studying them out Lord and Lord every little line that Paul spoke was just packed full of goodness and richness and treasures Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll just help us to unpack the things that Paul said in every little line of the things that he spoke be with us today Lord I pray you'll be with brother Wade as he's prepared and studying Lord Jesus and Open the Eyes of our heart Lord As we sing that song Lord as you'll open our eyes of understanding to know Lord whatever we have need of Lord that you'll help us in your name amen so Paul is saying here he said wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate so he went beyond all their ideas all the ideas of the Pharisees all the ideas of the people of that day and went outside the gate to to be to die to to give up everything not to take but to just give it all up he said let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp so we got to follow behind him and do the same thing with our with our own lives bearing his reproach for here have we no continuing City but we seek one we seek one to come and that should give us that's the confidence of a Christian because a Christian Life you know really really you start meditating on how a you you think that a Christian Life would be a flowery bed of roses and just nice and neat and everything but really when you get dive into Christianity you start giving your life to God you become a prisoner to God like Paul said I'm a prisoner and it begins begins to be maybe you go through times like job where you just look around and it's just a lot of sadness and things you're going through those deep those valleys but you know it's a valley a valley like the the three Hebrew children that went into the fire that's a valley when you see when you really see Christ on display and because because we have that confidence that he we have no continuing City we're we're on the road for something we're we're marching to something we're looking we're we're looking at not the things that we can see around we're not looking at the valley but we're looking to Christ and that's where our confidence is so we go out we got to go out beyond the camp following after Jesus and going beyond the camp brother brand said now watch what he says to do now in closing put out of the camp where the sacrifices was burned and that's what we're talking about Christ was a sacrifice and that's where he belonged he was the sacrifice now if we follow him out we've got to sacrifice our own self as well just like a little lamb just giving everything up ready to give up your own life and you think as we study this out you think about all the things that a Christian has to sacrifice even here when you when you sit here in church and maybe something will be explained that you don't quite understand like like so many times people will struggle with the those little basic what we call Basic doctrines of of of of Oneness of the godhead and how to be baptized and things and you got to sacrifice your old denominational ideas the way that you were maybe were raised up you got to lay that down and you got to battle it out and it's a sacrifice maybe it might take a long night of hard prayer to maybe you're searching through the scripture where does it say that anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and you battle it out and and after a while you just got to lay down your own thoughts and take what God's word says and that's that's how it is all through the scripture you you battle it out so so many times you know you see people they look at a quote or they look at a scripture and they're just they you can see that it says it right there on the page but they just can't sacrifice their own idea and just take what it says and that that's that so the whole Christian Life is sacrifice you got to sacrifice your ideas you got to sacrifice your thoughts you got to sacrifice your will you have to sacrifice everything for God for the other person you got to lay down yourself for the other now brother Ram said in going beyond the camp he said too he said now brother sister do you know that each one of you all must sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice sacrifice the things of the world sacrifice your own pleasures of this world sacrifice the things of this world you know the reason that people won't do it and he said we're not asked to manufacture something we we're asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit just like the little lamb that we're talking about that is the inside of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man has got Christ on the inside it makes him Christlike on the outside not some artificial put on now see there I I love quotes like this and where we're studying on sacrifice because that makes our pattern that we're following we sometimes you get so caught up in looking at somebody else as an example of how you should be as a Christian but our p pattern is the word and the word says that we're supposed to be like a little lamb or a little Dove just willing to lay everything down so that Christ can live in us and so Hebrews 13:15 says by him therefore let us offer what the sacrifice of praise that even your praise is a sacrifice and that's where sometimes many of us we struggle in church because we're so careful about what somebody else thinks about us that we don't want to say Amen we don't want to lift our hand because we're so careful it's it's and where where I'm going with this lesson is selfishness selfishness where you're so you're more concerned about yourself than really letting loose and praising God or laying down yourself that's that's what it all you got to sacrifice yourself but what when you when you really can break through and not care just Worship in the way that God wants you to maybe just cut loose with with crying or or or just whatever way that that that you are made to be and and begin to sacrifice that's when you can really see God begin to move let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased so the whole Christian Life doing good and and acting out Christianity all those things it's it it's all sacrifices everything that a Christian does is sacrifice and show us the the father and it suffices he he says but now back to Cain and Abel when Cain worshiped he built an altar he sacrificed he worshiped God but that wasn't enough and it was beautiful no doubt the flowers and things that grows in the field and he de decorated his altar while soon as Easter come while soon as as soon as Easter come across the Nations there'll be million dollars spent for Easter flowers that go on the altar well God don't care about that Easter flower on the altar he wants you on the altar you're the person for the altar not your flower or your money he wants you the altar was built for you to sacrifice your own will to his will now there's there's the thing of look looking in the scripture seeing what God says you're supposed to do and and then laying down your own will and saying I I accept God instead of my own will my own thoughts I'm willing to lay down everything that's why so as we study these things out we'll find out some things that we got to sacrifice one we got to sacrifice our personal desires and self-will just like uh Jesus was was showing us as an example as he died on the cross Jesus said in Matthew chapter 16 If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross what what does that mean deny yourself so that you can prefer somebody else in your whole Christian Life that's that's how that's how you have a good marriage as you get so selfish and you're like well I ain't taking out the trash that's your job or whatever but if you're willing to to lay down your own life and serve your spouse lay down your own life and serve your children when you get home from a hard day at work and and you uh you're too tired to have devotions but but you do it anyway maybe you're too you're too tired to pray but you you're willing to lay down your own self-will and and get on your knees and and pray for a little bit you because you're it's the whole thing is sacrifice for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it in questions and answers brother Ram said see Satan was once the Archangel of God and we're talking about uh sacrifice in your life giving versus taking and we'll see here that the nature of Satan is actually to take and to exalt himself rather than to Humble himself he once dwelt in the heaven he once was the greatest person in the heavens outside of God he was God's rightand man to fellowship and he got puffed up in his heart and isn't that just the way that people get today let God just bless a fell and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know-it-all he gets to be he's got to start an organization or he's got to do something that's different why AR thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that see a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a God why is it so hard because what we're battling is self we're battling our self and when you begin to see self rise up you know that's not of God because the that Godly christly nature is going to be like a little lamb that's willing to just give whatever it produces give it away when you begin to see self rise up that's something's something's off-kilter and questions and answers brother R said as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God that's that's that humanism humanism is where you begin to worship yourself instead of God you start looking at your ideas well I I I'm I don't I don't care what the Bible says I'm going to take my what I think is the authority he wants wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do what me and me and mine all that that's the wrong attitude God's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and more he blessed the little the man will become a ain't that something the more He blesses you that the smaller and the liter you become that's right that that's got to be a supernatural act for for somebody to overcome self so much until they can get smaller and smaller and little the more that God pours out his blessings on them so selfishness is the biggest enemy brother BR said the greatest enemy you got is yourself that's the reason we have to Die daily that's the reason Paul had to Die daily he had to die to Paul in order that Christ could live in him what what does that mean to die every day every day every day you come home from work maybe and you you want what you want instead of instead of maybe like brother R said he come home and course we all fail at this you come home I certainly do you come home and and and rather than doing something for your spouse you just want everything done for you you want the whole family to serve you you want everything done for you and instead of instead of trying to do for others and and and that's see that's the battle that that's and that that's really you know that's what a minister gets up behind the platform and they they've laid down their own life through the week they got home after after work and they went to studying and they study and pray and study and pray because they're trying to give out something selfishness getting rid of yourself getting rid of your own ideas and your own Ambitions and things just like Jesus there in the Garden of Gethsemane that we keep laboring the point on that he could have said well I'm I want my own way that I'm going to have a family I'm going to I'm going to get married to a nice girl have a family I'm I'm going to just lay what what my plan and purpose is aside but instead of that he said not my will not my will I'm laying I'm crucifying My Own will there in the Garden of Gethsemane he's laying his own will down and doing what his plan and purpose was which was to that's the hard Road that's hard that's why Christianity sometimes is hard to lay down your own will and do what God wants to to see done so that his plan and purpose can be fulfilled self-will self-will is always to lift yourself up but God's will see I got a little picture here this man in front of the mirror he's doctoring himself up he's got a little Halo he's thinking great of himself boy look at me I I've got a nice suit I got a brand new haircut that probably cost me $150 I'm I'm somebody I got this halo over my head look how great I am but on the other hand you got somebody that's willing to do something for somebody else willing to go take some get get some groceries for a little old sister or help somebody Christianity real Christianity is living for other people living for others and that's why I I love this Parable what the Jesus told in Luke chapter 14 I'm not going to belabor the point but down there at verse 11 he said who whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted now there's the story of real Christianity in that little lamb just willing to just give out give out for other people so selfishness selfishness is really you could say it's is it the greatest evil it's it's certainly an evil and as aw pink said he said the very essence of sin is the determination to have my own way and and you can follow that all through the Bible look at look at Cain who said if if I'm going to come to God it's going to have to be my way could you imagine a man sitting there seeing the fire of God come down and consume Abel's sacrifice and saying I don't care I'm going to do my own way anyway I don't care and that's how so many people look at the Bible they read the Bible that way they can see it Vindicated and the life of Christians all around them and the life of brother brandham and that they'll turn away from it because they're unwilling to lay down their own life and accept what is plain as day before their face and Martin Luther Martin Luther said he said the sin underneath benath all our sins is to trust the LIE of the serpent that we cannot trust the love and grace of Christ and must take matters into our own hands that that's self selfishness and he said again God created the world out of nothing so long as we are nothing he can make something out of us now you see how that permeates every every fast we we'll go you know maybe maybe today some of you will go home and you'll think uh maybe you'll be upset maybe some of the the way that the that Christianity is is presented and you'll go home and you'll have your own conception of how things are and you and you maybe you won't come to church and you'll battle it out you'll think I would rather have Christianity my way than to do what the Bible says I'm going to just stay at home and and stew in my little uh my my little situation and be upset at that this or that or or be upset at the way the gospel is presented or something that happen in that church and I'm just going to stay away from church I'm not going to repent I'm not going to lay down my life and there is selfishness that's why that's the worst the worst thing is selfish you f follow that all the way down through scripture from Judas and balum God come down and told balum how to prophesy and yet balum said I I'd rather have the money I'd rather have the popularity s popularity and money and all those things where we're unwilling so look at look at all these stories in Scripture it was Adam and man selfish decision to eat what was forbidden that led to sin entering the world in the fall of humanity when God told him not to do it but they'd rather believe their own their own way and their own ideas instead Cain's jealousy and selfishness led him to murder his brother Abel when giving a choice lot selfishly chose the best land for himself that's because you given a choice and somebody like lot will always choose for themsel and the Rich Young Ruler selfish attachment to his possessions kept him kept him from following Jesus and Judas is carot his selfishness led him to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver and ananas and Safar selfishly kept back a portion of the proceeds from their sale of the land while claiming to get everything to the church and you look at uh uh just kind of studying this out in in Isaiah chapter 14 it talks about Satan's and you know really if you meditate on this the war in heaven started before way back before the foundation of the world and that that great battle began to be fall out between the angels and and and and Satan Satan and and all the angels that he pulled away and those same Angels now are in the church anointing people anointing people that with the same attributes they come and they they uh that same battle now has come to the Earth and they're anointing you so the same attributes that s Satan demonstrated now is being demonstrated here on the earth you can see the selfishness of Satan can be is now being demonstrated in the selfishness of people look look at what Satan said in Isaiah 14 I will Ascend into heaven so Satan wanted to exalt himself I will exalt my throne above the stars of God Satan's ambition to have authority and dominion over the angels He said I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and these are if you study this out these are the five wheels of Satan in Isaiah 14 I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high the ultimate expression of Satan's pride and his desire to be equal with God so look how you can discern you can discern because the the attribute of Christ is always to just give out like a little lamb just give out and the attribute of Satan is always to take to se be selfish to to to gather to himself I will Ascend into heaven Proverbs 16:18 says Pride goeth Before Destruction and an Hy spirit before a fall and in James 4:6 he says but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and you know I got this little Point here just written out true greatness comes from through serving others and Mark chapter 10 he said but Jesus called to them and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many Satan said I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in other words I I want to have control instead of submitting to God's word to submitting to his will I want to be in control but Matthew 6:33 says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you Satan said I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds in other words uh you you're pursuing after to pursue after power and control over your circumstances and things that's that's where we go wrong is we look at circumstances and we get so worried about politics and things and instead of just submitting to God and trusting that God's going to bring things to pass he's going to he it we like James said submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you and Proverbs chapter 3 says trust in the Lord will all with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths now that's where we struggle is to trust in God and not our own understanding to look to the word for our guidance and not our own thoughts or not our own will but if the word says that the word we've got that promise the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth and the word is what is guiding us and leading us I will be like the most high the human temptation to act as our own God determining what is right and wrong for ourselves and others when God Alone is the source of Truth and we should submit to his will like Isaiah 55 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and in John chapter 14 it said Jesus saith and him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me and my wife and I were walking down the the the road one day and we we stopped there was a man at his mailbox and and he started talking to us and he was saying all all religions all religions lead to Salvation and I my my mind went back to this scripture that he said I am the way Jesus is the only way but that's see that's the battle when the Bible says something and our mind and our thought and our background and the way that we raised says something different are we willing to lay that down and take what the Bible says instead to take what God Said now that's what the sacrifice is to sacrifice your will and your thoughts and your ambition and lay everything down like Jesus did at the Garden of Gethsemane and just lay it all down for Christ then Christ can really use us if we're willing to sacrifice it all God bless you Saints [Applause]
