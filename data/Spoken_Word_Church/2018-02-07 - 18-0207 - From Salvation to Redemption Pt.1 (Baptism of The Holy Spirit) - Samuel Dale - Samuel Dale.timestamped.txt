[0:15] openly
[0:21] from the eyes of my heart
[0:24] [Music]
[0:27] I want to see a man

[1:36] [Music]
[1:39] amen and amen amen
[1:41] I think if you take a look around you
[1:43] might find in mind good to see everybody
[1:45] in the house of the Lord
[1:46] you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[1:48] turn what we've been reading in Jonah 2
[1:51] and it will go to Ephesians 1 remember
[1:56] all the people that are out with all of
[1:58] the sicknesses and everything is just
[1:59] scattered everywhere and everybody is 6
[2:02] or that that gives us a point - that
[2:05] puts us to a basics that we need to do a
[2:08] lot of praying you know because I'm just
[2:12] straight as I say it like this you
[2:15] praying for somebody else is good but
[2:17] you know what next week you might need
[2:19] somebody pray for you all right so it's
[2:22] a good point that we need to do a lot of
[2:24] praying and pray one for another for all
[2:26] of these that are sick and all I kept
[2:29] the little one sometimes and this
[2:30] wretched Lord would touch each one
[2:33] remember now the fellowship meeting will
[2:35] be here on the third Saturday in March
[2:38] brother Ernie Villanueva the Lord
[2:40] willing we'll be ministering for us that
[2:44] weekend so we'll keep these things in
[2:46] your prayers the other announcements
[2:50] Terrance's made them and everything so
[2:53] just whatever we have coming up just
[2:56] remember each one and now on to I would
[3:01] ask you to listen to this past Sunday's
[3:05] message now if you have it and don't
[3:08] have an ability to do it on the computer
[3:11] all you got to do is let Richard know it
[3:14] and you make you a copy of a you know of
[3:17] a CD that you can play on yours and
[3:20] things because that was a very timely
[3:27] and relevant Rev relating message to me
[3:32] to her that we could follow in and you
[3:35] will see that where I'm going as it's
[3:37] dropping right in behind it and I'll
[3:40] actually be quoting and coming in to the
[3:43] same
[3:43] things he was Sunday and you know he he
[3:47] kind of got a little bit length these
[3:49] are about two hours of it but we didn't
[3:52] have anything else to do and the
[3:53] services and things and you know and it
[3:55] wouldn't really you know that bad but
[3:58] yet we don't want to take a chance with
[4:00] people coming in and getting hurt and
[4:03] all coming up and going back so we try
[4:06] to do and we try to contact all of you
[4:09] after all we do we're gonna miss one so
[4:13] of what I say to you and they're gonna
[4:15] make up a list trying to get it right is
[4:18] anytime that there's a bad weather
[4:20] condition existing call somebody or go
[4:24] to the to the internet systems that were
[4:27] everybody is to contact everybody see if
[4:30] you'll do that then you'd find out in a
[4:33] hurry that you know which would not and
[4:35] not come on you know and do everything
[4:38] and do it and even I've always been
[4:41] tried to encourage you that even if you
[4:43] do come on may be real careful about it
[4:46] and if you feel in danger don't do it
[4:48] just at home we've got the tapes we can
[4:52] play it and things like that but now
[4:54] that would be a real good when I was
[4:56] reading the thing the other day for a
[4:58] guy the cartoon in the paper and he was
[5:01] telling that you know kind of like the
[5:02] guy that said he couldn't go I couldn't
[5:04] go to work that day because his wife was
[5:07] sick and he's sitting out on the creek
[5:08] bank you know fishing well that's pretty
[5:10] well like a lot of people do you know
[5:13] they'll say well you know we can't go to
[5:15] church may be a good time to go fishing
[5:17] you know but okay just keep it in your
[5:23] mind and keep your thoughts running on
[5:25] that alright let's go - Jonah - and then
[5:30] we'll go to Ephesians one father we
[5:34] thank you for the day in the hour that
[5:36] we have and thank you for your love and
[5:38] your grace unto us that were Father that
[5:41] we can follow into your footsteps and
[5:43] walk in the light of your love we ask
[5:45] you to bless each one Lord we know that
[5:47] brother
[5:48] lluís and his family sick Lord little
[5:50] lilies are sick and the different ones
[5:52] here many here that are sick among us
[5:55] and coughing and
[5:57] everything father we plead the blood of
[5:59] our Lord and Savior and believe in that
[6:02] by your stripes we are healed and we
[6:05] thank you for it and we just commit it
[6:08] into your hands and believe in that
[6:09] you'll take care of everybody and let
[6:12] everything be all right we love you as
[6:14] we read your words you come and speak to
[6:16] our hearts in Jesus name all right we'll
[6:24] you'll see in a moment that we are
[6:27] changing titles not thought the titles
[6:32] so we'll get along with it and and move
[6:35] on to that in a few minutes but let's
[6:37] read this from Jonah because we we've
[6:40] been bringing that thought but I will
[6:44] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[6:46] Thanksgiving I will pay that I have
[6:48] vowed salvation is of the Lord we don't
[6:52] have to read the next we know what
[6:54] happened God then delivered Jonah all
[6:58] right now let's go to Galatians excuse
[7:02] me Ephesians and start with verse 4 and
[7:06] just read and then when we get to the
[7:09] mess with the part of changing the title
[7:11] you'll see where we wedged in from back
[7:13] here because our title is going to
[7:15] change we've been using the title called
[7:18] salvation alright
[7:20] that meaning deliverance okay now we're
[7:23] going to pick up and the title for a
[7:26] while will be from salvation to
[7:31] Redemption okay so you'll you'll catch
[7:35] the point of what we're doing as we go
[7:38] along and try to give understanding
[7:42] verse 4 according as he has chosen us in
[7:45] him before the foundation of the world
[7:47] that we should be holy and without blame
[7:49] before him and love having predestinated
[7:52] us unto the adoption of children by
[7:55] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[7:57] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[7:59] of the glory of His grace wherein he
[8:02] hath made us accepted in the beloved in
[8:05] whom we have redemption through his
[8:08] blood the forgiveness of sins the court
[8:10] to the riches of his grace Corian he
[8:14] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[8:16] and prudence having made known unto us
[8:19] the mystery of his will the prophet said
[8:22] that was to adopt us we'll get into that
[8:24] in a later messages on the adoptions and
[8:27] they having made known unto us the
[8:30] mystery of his will according to his
[8:33] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[8:35] himself that in the dispensation of the
[8:38] fullness of times he might gather
[8:40] together in one all things in Christ
[8:42] both which are in heaven and look what
[8:46] your Redemption is going from heaven to
[8:47] earth ever all things which are on earth
[8:50] even in him in whom also we have
[8:53] obtained an inheritance being
[8:55] predestinated according to the purpose
[8:57] of him who worketh all things after the
[9:00] counsel of his own will that we should
[9:02] be to the praise of his glory who first
[9:06] trusted in Christ in whom ye also
[9:09] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[9:12] truth know after you heard the word of
[9:16] truth
[9:18] Holy Ghost ain't gonna following anybody
[9:20] that ain't heard the word what would it
[9:23] do you got to hear the word first right
[9:25] after you heard the word of truth the
[9:28] gospel of your salvation and whom also
[9:31] after that you believed you were sealed
[9:33] with that now notice the statement
[9:36] though that that's why would this not
[9:39] say he'd be sealed with a with the Holy
[9:41] Spirit
[9:42] since we ye were sealed with that holy
[9:47] spirit of promise now he tells you what
[9:50] the holy spirit of promise is what is it
[9:53] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[9:56] until the redemption of the purchased
[9:59] possession unto the praise of his glory
[10:04] you may be seated
[10:05] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[10:08] of the word
[10:11] now as I said the other day and I'm
[10:13] truthful in doing it and trying my best
[10:16] to get us to understand and we covered
[10:19] where brother Branham said that there
[10:21] was over 900 different on churches and
[10:26] things you know denominations and and
[10:28] all I gave you the message are a couple
[10:30] of times and he said that that meant
[10:32] there was over 900 different ways of
[10:35] seeing the new birth or the born-again
[10:39] experience of what nine hundred and
[10:42] somethin different ways of seeing one
[10:44] thing that Jesus first message that he
[10:48] preached was you must be born again now
[10:53] the mass confusion then is not centered
[10:56] around the seals the plagues of ours the
[10:59] trumpets the marriage and divorce of
[11:00] things the mass confusion of the day is
[11:06] centered around because honestly come on
[11:10] now it's just think the way I do for a
[11:12] little bit you don't have to worry about
[11:14] the Baptist Methodist and I'm not
[11:15] talking at them but they don't preach
[11:17] the seals the plagues the vials of
[11:19] thunders no and the marriage and
[11:20] divorces and all like that they Pete
[11:23] preach what do they preach now what did
[11:26] brother Brown said about Billy Graham
[11:27] the greatest man that he said ever was
[11:30] it had the message of salvation now he
[11:34] bragged on him he said nobody had it
[11:36] like he had it all right see if you can
[11:39] go out and people even in this message
[11:40] and a lot of you said it we need to know
[11:43] something about salvation well right and
[11:46] now we're getting the opportunity let's
[11:48] see what you do with it let's see what
[11:52] you do with this opportunity of trying
[11:55] to talk about salvation I noticed on the
[12:00] internet kind of tickle to me the my
[12:04] popularity rate
[12:07] you know we can see on there how many
[12:09] hits you get and my popularity rate
[12:13] since I've started in this new birth I
[12:15] told you the deaths and you don't have
[12:17] to preach all those deep things just
[12:18] break up the churches my popularity
[12:21] right check it you that looking in the
[12:23] Internet has went down drastically
[12:26] there's not a lot of people connecting
[12:29] on as a matter of fact the last time I
[12:31] looked at the licenses they wasn't
[12:34] enough on there to be how many people
[12:36] here that do connect on that didn't
[12:42] connect I don't maybe you're getting
[12:45] bored about this that I'm trying to
[12:49] bring what do you understand the
[12:50] situation now I'm trying to express
[12:53] don't worry about to imagine a divorce
[12:56] or seals a thing the denominations are
[12:58] not teaching them what are they teaching
[13:00] what is all basic organizations teaching
[13:03] a form of salvation a new birth a
[13:07] born-again experience a baptism of the
[13:10] Holy Ghost
[13:11] that's that true icon I mean that's the
[13:16] point that I'm getting it that still
[13:18] after all of this time it's your prophet
[13:20] said there's 900 different ways of
[13:22] people saying that I didn't make them
[13:27] state let's see you're gonna have to
[13:29] argue with him about it one of these
[13:30] days I have I become your enemy called
[13:35] enemy because I found the truth you know
[13:38] that's a little different when scripture
[13:40] was true in it all right let's see think
[13:43] about it the whole world and the basics
[13:47] of salvation you know Christianity
[13:51] preaches a redemptive message
[13:55] and don't want to get into the deep
[13:58] things right now come on is that right I
[14:04] mean you think about what are they
[14:06] preaching right over here
[14:08] what are they preaching out over here
[14:10] they're preaching you need to be saved
[14:12] they're preaching you need to do this
[14:14] the preaching you need to do that and
[14:16] you know what they're getting people to
[14:18] come to the altar they're getting
[14:20] salvation for the people they're getting
[14:23] people coming to churches they're
[14:24] filling the churches up and all and I
[14:32] know so you think that I'm just hateful
[14:34] because of doing it but if I told you
[14:36] the truth I mean is that the truth if
[14:39] that's not the truth somebody stand up
[14:41] and tell me that that's not the truth
[14:43] and I'll quit right now I won't finish
[14:46] this sermon because you know you can't
[14:52] argue that point you know what I'm
[14:54] saying is the truth that the world
[14:56] Christian systems deals basically with
[14:59] memberships with getting the people to
[15:03] churches getting them saved
[15:06] getting them to Sunday schools getting
[15:09] them to youth camps getting them to do
[15:12] it and says works right over into the
[15:14] message you know until it's word that
[15:19] people don't want to hear anything about
[15:21] salvation
[15:22] they won't mean about the depth of the
[15:25] message they want to hear some simple
[15:27] thing about salvation and I'm sorry but
[15:35] you think I don't do it but I cry and
[15:37] pray all the time this message right now
[15:39] that I'm trying to bring you is the
[15:41] hardest part that I've ever preached in
[15:43] my life no well no back up no thoughts
[15:49] no problem I'm just telling you that
[15:52] it's burden my heart because the one
[15:54] time
[15:56] I'm responsible for your soul but if I
[16:01] tell you the truth I'm not responsible
[16:03] so if I have to borrow no bum not gonna
[16:06] bar any holes in this I bar hold you
[16:09] think I don't look what I do a lot him
[16:11] but if it comes down to it I'll call
[16:13] names because people say I never heard
[16:20] brother so-and-so say that well maybe he
[16:25] didn't hear that in the more than you do
[16:26] hear me but that's alright if I do then
[16:31] you just forgive me yeah I know it's
[16:36] it's going with it what I'm just trying
[16:38] to get you to see the and spending or
[16:43] was it 17 sermons on salvation and never
[16:48] got out of the Old Testament because the
[16:54] word salvation in the Old Testament is
[16:57] deliverance and they had salvation back
[17:02] there they had deliverance they had God
[17:06] living in them they had things happening
[17:09] under that salvation they had a place to
[17:12] go to when they died it provided all of
[17:15] those things under salvation
[17:19] but I wouldn't a profit that said that
[17:22] the Old Testament only spoke for the
[17:25] knew that there was no redemption
[17:29] there's no word repent I mean the word
[17:32] redemption is used about fourteen times
[17:35] I think maybe a little less in the Old
[17:37] Testament but it's basically speaking of
[17:40] a redemption like a price paid for an
[17:43] individual it speaks nothing of a soul
[17:46] or a relation like you're doing the new
[17:49] work so that's what we've been over and
[17:50] over and over and over that nobody in
[17:53] that Old Testament had the new birth
[17:57] there was no way to have it because
[17:59] Jesus Christ had not died what you see
[18:04] I'm sorry but you see you make that
[18:09] statement and you say Church I
[18:12] understood that in the Baptist Church
[18:15] before I ever heard of this message or
[18:17] anything because I could read the Bible
[18:19] I could read the Bible you didn't read
[18:25] it the Bible tells you that the Holy
[18:31] Ghost is not been given because Jesus
[18:34] has not been crucified and the greatest
[18:41] of all I knew that in the Baptist Church
[18:42] and talked about it to the people were
[18:45] that it talks about John the Baptist the
[18:47] greatest of all we have one of the Bible
[18:50] said that said the least in the kingdom
[18:53] is greater than John what's the homem
[19:01] let's see I know now see you freeze up
[19:04] on there I don't know how to discernment
[19:06] don't have to have I got sense you
[19:09] freeze up when I say they didn't know
[19:13] baptism with the Holy Ghost back there
[19:15] I've went through everything sermon
[19:18] after sermon trying to express it even
[19:20] like we had their last Sunday you know
[19:22] talking about where brother Branham said
[19:24] to Adam only potentially and had the
[19:31] Holy Ghost I don't remember the exact
[19:33] wording but he said the prophets they
[19:37] just had the potentially went through
[19:42] trying to get you to see that even John
[19:46] the greatest of all receiving that Holy
[19:50] Ghost while he was in his mother's womb
[19:56] yet that did not put him in the kingdom
[20:03] that didn't put him in the kingdom now
[20:07] watch it we're going to get back to
[20:09] something in just a minute the Prophet
[20:10] said he said what's wrong with he said
[20:14] the baptism when the Holy Ghost is not
[20:17] taught correctly you remember that less
[20:20] famous names if you miss it I don't get
[20:22] that far
[20:23] he said we say baptism he said we say
[20:26] that like an automobile he said a lot
[20:28] goes with an automobile and I don't
[20:34] understand that's that's what I don't
[20:35] understand because taking what brother
[20:38] Branham has said and bringing it to you
[20:40] for 40 years over a lot of things that
[20:43] knowing that Adam had eternal life in
[20:46] his soul but over and over I've been
[20:50] through it with you Adam never went
[20:52] through justification sanctification and
[20:55] got the bad views and when the holy God
[20:57] no it was imparted to Adam he his way
[21:01] said to her Sunday he there was nothing
[21:04] had him at Dorney they had to repent to
[21:07] get life in him because he got life to
[21:09] start with he didn't have to repent to
[21:13] get it
[21:15] John the Baptist I've tried my best I've
[21:19] searched for 40-something years knowing
[21:22] that John received the Holy Ghost before
[21:25] in his mother's womb but knowing that it
[21:28] was not quote the baptism of the Holy
[21:33] Spirit because that come onto their
[21:36] Pentecost the last Sunday they're trying
[21:40] to get you to see that John never went
[21:43] to justification sanctification
[21:48] none of those Old Testament Saints could
[21:50] go through it
[21:51] Abraham only typed it he just typed it
[21:56] in the things that was doing in his life
[22:03] because they couldn't get eternal life
[22:06] back their end of their soul as a new
[22:08] birth
[22:13] because it wasn't dire well is that
[22:16] enough who can argue the point of
[22:23] salvation upon what I've just said what
[22:26] you know everybody ain't gonna believe
[22:27] it
[22:27] are you ain't gonna believe it you're
[22:29] sitting on now figuring out this
[22:30] figuring out now you wait'll we get over
[22:32] about another message from now and start
[22:34] reading some things brother Branham say
[22:36] it that literally looks like he don't
[22:40] know what in the world he's talking
[22:43] about we'll let him be the one that says
[22:47] it see that's what I say things like
[22:54] that then it just goes dead well you're
[22:58] trying to correct a prophet if I'm
[23:00] telling you what that prophet said you
[23:04] tell me some other way you tell me some
[23:10] other way than telling you what he said
[23:14] what are you following me
[23:17] the we went through Hebrews 9 where it
[23:22] speaks off that's nice they're back
[23:23] darkness on the internet for people out
[23:25] there in Hebrews nine or did it speaks
[23:29] of without the death of the testator you
[23:31] couldn't have a New Testament right
[23:35] there was no way to have a New Testament
[23:38] without the death of Jesus Christ
[23:43] so then it was potential which meant it
[23:46] was a partial realization you can even
[23:53] call what they had back there and
[23:54] earnest which is gonna have to be real
[23:57] careful because once we get this message
[23:59] out there's a little bit one more
[24:01] message we're gonna come into where
[24:03] we're not going to be talking about
[24:05] partial realization we're gonna be start
[24:11] talking about perfect realization but it
[24:15] would be perfect realization for right
[24:16] here but tomorrow it becomes partial
[24:20] until it's finished that's the message
[24:22] of why we changed the title we're
[24:25] talking about from salvation that comes
[24:30] basically on the point of you believing
[24:35] and we're going to go all the way to the
[24:39] redemption of the body and then you can
[24:45] say I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[24:52] because it's but what the Prophet What
[24:56] did he say he said it's been so
[24:58] incorrectly taught oh you little brother
[25:02] do you think you're teasing it correct
[25:04] come and show me I'm not arrogant or
[25:08] hateful come and show me I've never
[25:12] asked for anybody to do anything with
[25:13] that
[25:14] I've asked those that left here to come
[25:17] and show me where I wrong they ain't
[25:19] done it yet
[25:21] you can say what I think whatever well
[25:24] they ain't done it yeah well they do
[25:30] just know you're too arrogant hateful
[25:32] you ain't gonna listen well you know
[25:34] what that might mean if you come to them
[25:35] with the truth and I'm arrogant hey that
[25:37] makes me lost and you say so why don't
[25:39] you try it I don't mind talking to
[25:43] anybody
[25:44] cuz I don't understand a lot of things
[25:47] brother I never say it
[25:49] and I don't speak about it until I do
[25:51] understand it and then when I do
[25:54] understand it I read what he said now
[25:59] you gonna have to argue with him you
[26:02] can't come up to me and say that's your
[26:04] way of feeling at this if I'm saying
[26:07] what he said it ain't my wesen
[26:11] bring anything contrary but listen all
[26:19] of that back there was faced in the shed
[26:21] blood of an animal faith in that blood
[26:25] of that animal but it had no way to
[26:27] bring that life code it had no life to
[26:30] come back into the human being because
[26:34] it had no soul all right so then it was
[26:37] potential or what would keep them for a
[26:40] time and unless they wrote another one
[26:43] in here are like words to write it
[26:45] sustained about how you pronounce that
[26:48] sustained in other words that sustained
[26:50] him for the time for the time it was
[26:52] what was needed and it's abstained them
[26:55] for the time anybody I don't internet
[26:57] this you look it up but listen
[27:04] then if my quote right around him he
[27:10] said what about under the blood of bulls
[27:11] and goats and he said they could do all
[27:14] of these things he said what about you
[27:17] and I honor the baptism of the holy God
[27:18] right you realized then they told Old
[27:22] Testament Saints I tried my best to
[27:25] explain it to the Sunday
[27:26] those are Old Testament Saints that Holy
[27:29] Ghost could come on them so much until
[27:32] David could kill a bar a line and a
[27:34] giant by the Holy Ghost that come upon
[27:37] him and that was the Holy Ghost but it
[27:48] could not come and live within them as a
[27:52] new birth you realize the difference in
[27:58] you and the Old Testament Saints and you
[28:01] tell me oh I'm a believer I believe yes
[28:03] I believe that no arguing me on them
[28:05] times because I'll go back and quotes
[28:07] you where they believe so much and until
[28:09] Abraham took his child out and was going
[28:11] to kill him he's gonna show how he
[28:14] believed you gonna do it yours ain't
[28:16] doing that with mine so ain't that much
[28:18] of a believer
[28:19] I thought you blew I'm just trying to
[28:23] tell you you ain't either
[28:25] that's this plaintiff I can make it
[28:28] alright but getting it to the point of
[28:31] her that we can see the difference
[28:34] between the Old Testament and the New
[28:36] Testament and then talking about those
[28:41] disciples that only had the Holy Ghost
[28:45] potentially I mean excuse me the
[28:49] justification the same things
[28:50] potentially back there they didn't have
[28:55] the Holy Ghost it hasn't come yet now it
[28:58] could come like it did with David and
[29:00] them it could come as an anointing upon
[29:03] them
[29:04] that's why brother Branham we'll get to
[29:07] it in many where he says the Holy Ghost
[29:08] he said it the baptism he said it has
[29:11] not been talked nine hundred and
[29:18] something different ways of
[29:19] understanding the new birth that's what
[29:25] he says why can't we believe it see see
[29:31] there was no redemption wait put it in
[29:33] his part the other day over and over
[29:35] there was no redemption
[29:40] in that Old Testament system the only
[29:46] spoke of redemption
[29:49] it only proclaimed the Old Testament
[29:51] proclaimed for the new spoke of it
[29:54] showed of it typed it because there was
[29:57] no way it could be back there you think
[30:03] this you think that I've just killed
[30:05] time and I know you get bored but one of
[30:12] these days maybe the next message I
[30:14] won't get to it tonight but we're going
[30:15] to start making some statements brother
[30:17] Brown and see it and if you ain't got
[30:18] all this as a background it's gonna show
[30:21] up in a hurry because you're gonna go
[30:24] out to Dover because you're gonna say
[30:27] I'm correcting brother Branham that I'm
[30:29] doing all of these things and you're
[30:30] gonna leave and the worst part of it a
[30:34] lot of you won't leave because they
[30:36] ain't nowhere else to go so you ain't
[30:38] gonna leave but you're gonna stay left
[30:40] and sit here that statement come out do
[30:46] it you're gonna stay here but you're
[30:49] gonna be gone you ain't gonna be like
[30:54] that sister on blasphemous names they
[30:58] said brother branham to call - the way
[31:00] you preaching that Holy Ghost that new
[31:04] birth I'm wondering whether I've got it
[31:09] or not
[31:14] because of the way he was preaching it
[31:16] he was preaching something contrary to
[31:18] every Baptist Methodist Presbyterian why
[31:21] couldn't you fit him in the category
[31:22] like I said well ago the whole world is
[31:24] preaching tonight salvation told you
[31:34] ain't in the Baptist Methodist no like a
[31:35] yeah they're not preaching seals plagues
[31:37] mild trumpets I ain't sayin somebody
[31:40] don't turn it on and do and listen I'm
[31:42] just saying you know what I'm telling
[31:44] you the truth
[31:45] their basic doubt is the salvation of
[31:48] point to get people to come to church
[31:51] and get memberships is what they want a
[31:53] million more than 44 right that was the
[31:59] Baptist in 44 but listen they were under
[32:05] potential until the fullness I'm quoting
[32:08] back from brother Branham trying to get
[32:10] down to where I can get into the message
[32:12] when he swore by on four by himself
[32:15] until the fullness of time come it was a
[32:19] potential waiting God's provided the
[32:23] place of worship waiting for the new one
[32:29] potential waiting for the new one new
[32:32] heart the new message to come just come
[32:36] on to a penny columns right Jesus preach
[32:39] that message but those disciples could
[32:41] go no father
[32:45] see I have a burden to pray because of
[32:49] trying to get things in the right order
[32:51] where you can understand and I make
[32:53] statements and then I know people
[32:58] how is it it took them three and a half
[33:01] years to come to a place they take it
[33:07] receiving the new birth but then the
[33:13] three thousand it took him 15 minutes to
[33:15] you're a sermon and there was the Holy
[33:17] Ghost and they got your new birth just
[33:23] exactly like the upper room except for
[33:24] one time the upper room was tutored and
[33:27] trained for three and a half years we'll
[33:29] get into adoptions with those thoughts
[33:31] but why
[33:38] and then you don't think about I was
[33:39] talking to brother there while ago
[33:41] matter see you don't think about that
[33:47] how come the Holy Ghost say I'm adding
[33:50] more to the thought we know the Holy
[33:52] Ghost came in Kinesis house huh that was
[33:55] just after pinnacle and the Bible said
[33:56] the Holy Ghost exactly like that night
[34:02] and it come many occasion then all at
[34:06] once you seem to have a dying down oh
[34:09] the coming of the holy God maybe the
[34:11] first church age lasted pretty good but
[34:15] after then you begin to drop down why
[34:23] Wow
[34:28] and am i telling you the truth you
[34:32] didn't start dropping down
[34:40] and say I prayed I prayed the Lord the
[34:42] other day said and I just said to her
[34:46] rejoice
[34:49] he said that devil started out in that
[34:52] early church blinding the people's eyes
[34:55] to the real understanding of what God
[34:58] was doing in the new birth and I said
[35:02] don't cry my soul goes I could see
[35:09] that's what happened you understand what
[35:13] I mean if you had to church ages to look
[35:15] at it you see it you see it in the first
[35:17] church age weight draw them out what is
[35:19] it and the Prophet trotted out us in the
[35:22] church said well what is it the first
[35:23] church age is got a little lip of black
[35:26] in it rest of it is white is it right
[35:30] next her shades had a little less wide
[35:32] next church age had a little less white
[35:34] next Church age had this - a little
[35:36] sliver of white at the bottom and all
[35:40] that was black why because Satan got
[35:44] into the minds of the people and started
[35:47] perverting them to the things that
[35:50] discipled even what's-his-name Evan a
[35:53] yes or whatever they wound up at the
[35:55] first and I see him counselor 325 AD
[35:57] then he wound up teaching that Jesus was
[36:00] another substance
[36:04] different substance from God you think
[36:07] they didn't do that you think that devil
[36:09] do you understand what happened do you
[36:12] get what happened the Holy Ghost fell
[36:17] into their penico why because they
[36:19] didn't have all their mind blackened out
[36:21] I'm talking about the 3000 outside they
[36:25] came out and seen the great things
[36:26] happening with a disciple and they said
[36:28] what can we do to be saved
[36:31] you know what they believed it may I
[36:34] explain it like this brother branham
[36:37] stay here in the States
[36:38] and not able to get know by the altar
[36:41] but go to the foreign fields and get
[36:46] twenty five thousand outstanding
[36:48] miracles at one time are twenty five
[36:52] thirty thousand born-again believers Wow
[36:57] because they hadn't heard the garbage
[37:00] was Satan started infiltrating with that
[37:03] garbage the end of that early church
[37:04] until they started dying down all right
[37:15] is it possible to test what's happening
[37:17] in the life state cause remember the
[37:22] last one goes totally out
[37:24] then I quoting brother Branham he left a
[37:27] little light the life one went and told
[37:31] darkness he left a little life that's
[37:35] why you talk to people now that's why
[37:36] you're sitting there you and the people
[37:38] of internet arguing with me about what
[37:40] I'm saying because you're trying to
[37:42] figure out something to argue with our
[37:44] quotes or thoughts and ideas instead of
[37:47] listening instead of saying hey he just
[37:54] made a point that was potential back
[38:01] there but it was enough to bring them
[38:05] and save them but we can't argue about
[38:09] potentials now if I get to it tonight
[38:15] when you see that baptism of the Holy
[38:17] Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost
[38:19] into the hearts of those signs that
[38:20] wasn't potential that was reality how
[38:30] come it is then they could go through
[38:32] the three thousand went through
[38:34] justification of sanctification and the
[38:36] baptism you've got to have that how the
[38:37] Newburg come on it's not just hear a
[38:40] sermon and jump up and down holler I got
[38:41] the new birth its justification
[38:44] sanctification the baptism when the old
[38:45] ghost is the new birth it took the
[38:46] disciples three and a half year to
[38:48] become justified and sanctified but
[38:52] outside it took three thousand people
[38:55] the insert they heard the word they went
[38:56] through justification sanctification and
[38:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:03] it's like the upper room Nichola to the
[39:08] house of canoeist and just one sermon
[39:17] those people went through justification
[39:20] sanctification of baptism of the holy
[39:21] ghost to get the new murder but then you
[39:24] find another situation sitting in the
[39:26] Bible if you've got Paul with the powers
[39:29] that a Polish was preaching join them
[39:33] about Jesus Christ but the Holy Ghost
[39:36] wouldn't come on why he was proving the
[39:43] Bible says that Jesus was the Christ a
[39:48] pilot was what Paul say have you
[39:53] received the Holy Ghost since you
[39:55] believed we may we've been believe in
[39:59] long time we believe that we believe
[40:01] that would be he said have you received
[40:05] the Holy Ghost since you believe you
[40:10] know what when they believed it you know
[40:14] what Holy Ghost came on rock when you
[40:18] believed it and that was a church in
[40:20] Ephesus where we just read listen George
[40:27] you understand what I'm trying to say to
[40:30] you and I I know it it turns into you
[40:36] for me to make a statement like I do
[40:38] that I wish I could preach it everybody
[40:40] in this building would find out they
[40:41] were lost because they could do
[40:43] something about it
[40:50] I want you to preach to let me know I'm
[40:53] saved
[40:53] oh you shouted you spoken to him okay
[40:57] you got a bad one who you've done one of
[40:58] these didn't you let's let's back up
[41:00] some group here we got nine hundred ways
[41:01] of going at it are you listening
[41:07] so let's write nine hundred ways who's
[41:10] getting born here and surely you could
[41:13] fit in one of them right but you got
[41:23] enough sense to know that that don't
[41:24] save you you just won't admit it those
[41:30] like I've said over and over you're
[41:31] still under that old bad dish you have
[41:33] Methodist sometime you're still under
[41:35] that whole part you scared to death
[41:38] because you are afraid that you don't
[41:46] have what you think you've got
[41:58] okay
[42:02] what about it
[42:06] you remember the Romania and then maniac
[42:10] of get areal wear bread around says it
[42:12] say that Adam had the holy ghost
[42:14] potentially and he's talked about the
[42:17] Apostles and things in the way they had
[42:19] they had it potentially why because
[42:22] there was no baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:26] they didn't have a new birth in the Old
[42:32] Testament they didn't have a born-again
[42:34] experience in the Old Testament they had
[42:39] an anointing of the Holy Ghost to fall
[42:41] upon them and great wonderful things
[42:43] happened but they never had a personal
[42:46] indwelling of this person of God come
[42:49] and live in them to give them so then
[42:55] you're to automatically know what I'm
[42:57] talking about
[42:58] you're to know where I'm going with the
[43:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost not something
[43:02] flowery coming out of heaven and all
[43:04] kind of things as you see
[43:11] you better read the book of Acts and see
[43:16] what happened in that upper room and how
[43:21] that there was a lick of tone on each
[43:23] one
[43:23] oh no it was just out shouting glory
[43:28] hallelujah
[43:29] oh they decide they just they just shut
[43:31] it on our loan
[43:41] okay
[43:44] I gave that into your brother Anderson
[43:46] so let's pull that up and start and we
[43:48] don't get very far we'll just go what
[43:50] we're gonna go and come back Sunday go
[43:55] ahead to number seven and let's just get
[43:57] this point out here because now listen
[44:01] if there's nine hundred in something
[44:04] different ways of the organizational
[44:06] systems I'll say it that way church is
[44:09] or whatever you want to call them but
[44:10] I'm not decreased United or nobody
[44:12] you're gonna find that out when I go
[44:14] along and get over into the message a
[44:16] little bit you're going to make light of
[44:18] me saying it so simple but remember
[44:24] you're gonna say what bread around said
[44:27] he said you get eternal life when you
[44:30] believe now do you want Tim quotes I've
[44:34] got them laying on the dash wellness
[44:39] where you do that now but just think
[44:42] about it nine hundred seven different
[44:45] ways of seeing a new birth let's just
[44:49] read one simple thing that he says and
[44:51] the problem with what's wrong from
[44:54] blasphemy his name is paragraph ninety
[44:56] What did he say he's talking about
[44:59] throwing the seat away you know you
[45:01] throw the when you get to our different
[45:03] group with him you know he said now
[45:05] there's some of these things you might
[45:06] miserably disagree with huh he said but
[45:10] don't do that don't throw it away if you
[45:12] eaten chicken don't throw the chicken
[45:13] away that stole the bone away are
[45:15] deceived you know whatever you run into
[45:17] and he said I believe that the reason
[45:20] that there is so much confusion today
[45:23] about the Holy Spirit
[45:29] it's not correctly taught
[45:38] I believe the baptism is taught and just
[45:46] say the baptism
[45:52] he's saying it's taught incorrectly but
[45:55] people teach the baptism now watch his
[45:58] answer but then be like you say
[46:04] automobile is that I got several
[46:07] mechanics and things like that he said
[46:08] now you know you've got spark plugs you
[46:10] got this and that in the other go to a
[46:12] car in other words you're talking about
[46:13] an automobile you've got a lot of things
[46:14] goes with it so he's saying you talking
[46:16] about the baptism you've got a lot to go
[46:18] with it you got a lot to go with the
[46:19] Holy Spirit other than just a Holy
[46:22] Spirit or baptism or what something so
[46:25] he said the baptism stalled well why is
[46:29] it taught 900 something different ways
[46:34] no now brother brother Dale down now dad
[46:37] that's not the quote brother branham
[46:38] said there was 900 several different
[46:40] ways to see in the Newberg oh I wish you
[46:44] hadn't said that because there's no
[46:49] teaching in the Old Testament at all
[46:52] about a new birth so you just wrapped
[46:55] yourself there's no teaching in the Old
[46:57] Testament about a born-again experience
[46:58] you just wrapped yourself there's no
[47:01] teaching in the Old Testament about a
[47:03] baptism of the Holy Spirit in the
[47:05] correct way of coming in and dwelling
[47:07] you you just killed your own point but
[47:11] you're not mean I'm man enough to admit
[47:12] it
[47:14] you won't just look at the thing and say
[47:17] well listen Lord what am i doing I mean
[47:22] that lady she got serious and she said
[47:25] I've got to have it
[47:38] but look what he says and when you talk
[47:41] about anytime an automobile got many
[47:43] parts with it and when you talk about
[47:45] the baptism of the Holy Spirit then
[47:48] there's a lot goes with that see there's
[47:51] a lot goes with it that and here is what
[47:56] I think that God is proving that the
[47:59] Holy Spirit is here cause you're gonna
[48:03] give the answer right hey folks we ain't
[48:08] getting there tonight the brother
[48:11] Brennan said I want you to know what the
[48:12] baptism in the Holy Spirit is according
[48:14] to the Bible according to the saith the
[48:18] Lord
[48:25] 900 different ways of seeing the new
[48:28] birth and on her different ways of
[48:30] seeing the born-again experience called
[48:31] you putting them together 900 something
[48:33] different ways we're seeing the baptism
[48:35] with the Holy Spirit well brother Dale
[48:39] you can't tell me I ain't got the
[48:40] baptism then a person that's ever been
[48:45] born again what age of whatever you are
[48:50] they didn't get the baptism of the Holy
[48:54] Spirit for their time for their age for
[49:00] whatever it was but then you know for
[49:05] sure that I'm talking about a baptism of
[49:09] the Holy Spirit and don't go home and
[49:14] try to read and do and figure out all
[49:17] these things cause remember we're gonna
[49:19] talk about
[49:22] the new birth if I get that far denies
[49:29] Donal maternal Vernon read it
[49:31] we've read a random talks of the new
[49:33] birth and the born-again experience and
[49:35] the baptism of the holy ghost all in the
[49:37] same paragraph and he says there's no
[49:44] two comings of the spirit there's no way
[49:51] to do that he said you can't find it in
[49:54] the scripture said there's no such thing
[49:57] he's being born again and baptized the
[50:00] end of the body in the scripture but
[50:02] he's the one that taught that in his
[50:04] early part of his ministry but he didn't
[50:07] teach that he was teaching the truth in
[50:10] the baptism come on let's get to it
[50:15] think about it
[50:22] the prophets Adam and them had the Holy
[50:25] Ghost potentially so I knew I knew back
[50:30] in her in when I early come into a
[50:32] message and coming along an arc oh that
[50:34] was one of the first doctrines with the
[50:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit whether you
[50:37] had it or not you know and that was
[50:39] really the one of the big time
[50:41] try studied the message from that and
[50:43] wrote down everything I could find but I
[50:46] knew that eventually I would find a
[50:48] statement that brother Branham made two
[50:51] very fine what I knew he was talking
[50:55] about and that he would finally come
[50:58] down and say those Old Testament people
[51:02] had the Holy Ghost
[51:05] it was an anointing upon them but it was
[51:09] not in their soul as a new birth to put
[51:14] them into the kingdom because why did
[51:16] Jesus preach for the three and a half
[51:17] years and every message was about the
[51:19] kingdom
[51:21] you can't enter the kingdom right but I
[51:24] knew that I would find one day but just
[51:28] to find a quote for brother branham's
[51:29] not it that's not it with many just to
[51:36] find a quote I can find you a quote for
[51:39] anything you want somebody or somebody
[51:41] just give me a quote right off top of
[51:43] your head and I'll talk from the top of
[51:47] my head I believe our quote from the
[51:48] Bible or brother runs message something
[51:50] contrary to it right
[51:58] you know the bible does say baptize in
[52:00] the name of the Father Son Holy Bible
[52:07] don't say that it does hey put down
[52:12] what's the revelation what's the
[52:14] understanding the only way you'll be
[52:16] baptized name father son Holy Ghost be
[52:17] baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[52:19] but you can't take out father son holy
[52:22] God it says and that's why when I
[52:28] baptized I baptized wasn't exactly the
[52:30] way brother branham done because that's
[52:31] where I found it i baptize thee my
[52:35] brother my sister to fulfill the great
[52:37] commission of matthew 28:19 baptize in
[52:40] the name of the Father and of the Son
[52:41] and of the Holy Ghost i baptize you my
[52:43] brother or sister in the name of the
[52:45] Lord Jesus Christ now there's no
[52:48] contradiction right but what about it
[52:54] when you got to where onto that message
[52:57] of the maniac from Oh got a real that's
[53:04] where we got to the seven eight and
[53:05] picked up a thought can I look what he
[53:08] says he said I'm not a debater and
[53:11] that's what the man was he was arguing
[53:13] about tongues read the whole before and
[53:15] after he was making a lot of people
[53:17] speaking in tongues and and he had his
[53:20] lineup to be right he said John never
[53:23] spoke in tongues he said you know oh he
[53:27] was naming them all and he's right but
[53:29] his point was he was going at it wrong
[53:31] so brother Branham was he say he they
[53:36] come down and he said now Zechariah
[53:37] didn't speak in tongues
[53:40] and I said that was before the holy
[53:42] ghost was ever given look what the man
[53:48] come back with man come back he said
[53:52] well they said they had a you know what
[53:56] his statement were they say they had the
[53:59] Spirit of God dwelling in them they say
[54:01] they had God living in there they say
[54:03] they had it once him I said now they did
[54:06] not say they had the baptism of the holy
[54:10] ghost now he's making a difference
[54:14] between just an anointing Balaam was
[54:19] anointed with the Holy Ghost but he had
[54:26] no perhaps his room that would have
[54:27] changed it
[54:28] well I just don't really I believe bad
[54:30] piers my whole go same time it is
[54:35] because it could anoint this person over
[54:37] here the same Holy Ghost it anoints you
[54:41] is the same Holy Ghost it anoints deal
[54:47] that's where people don't agree with me
[54:49] on the new bar are they teaching the
[54:51] other could you see I believe every
[54:54] born-again believer gets an anointing on
[54:57] their spirit it's same as an anointed
[55:02] one gets an anointing on their spirit
[55:04] the only difference is the born-again
[55:06] believer has held the word and the
[55:08] spirit when it comes down on to the word
[55:10] it quickens it and there's your new
[55:13] birth in the soul now go home with that
[55:16] one because if you don't believe it you
[55:18] say I never heard you teach it that's
[55:19] what I've taught for 40 years
[55:25] that Holy Spirit comes down on your
[55:27] spirit its body to body spirit to spirit
[55:33] soul to soul that baptism Californa
[55:40] Balaam or come upon an anointed one in
[55:42] time and it don't make the word alive in
[55:45] them why because it's the wrong word and
[55:47] God can't quicken that but a person has
[55:51] held that true word that's why I said
[55:54] well ago what I did it's got to where
[55:56] you can't hardly get people to listen
[55:58] long enough about the Holy Ghost because
[56:00] they've got sold so much about it until
[56:02] they know all about it and he ain't
[56:04] gonna listen to you well if you're
[56:06] telling them the truth what if they're a
[56:09] Polish what if when powell said have you
[56:13] received the Holy Ghost since you
[56:14] believe pollicis a blessed God I'll have
[56:16] you know we've been believers long in
[56:17] you have and I've been proving Jesus was
[56:21] the Christ
[56:22] when used-up crucify me no he didn't do
[56:28] that did he shut his mouth and listen to
[56:32] a man they said a few words and the Holy
[56:34] Ghost fell I said now they did not say
[56:40] they had the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[56:43] now he's explaining what he's talking
[56:45] about Adam had the Holy Ghost
[56:47] potentially he didn't have the baptism
[56:49] with the Holy Ghost put him in the body
[56:51] of Christ but he had the Holy Ghost
[56:56] all the profits as they were moved by
[56:59] the holy ghost
[57:01] so John had the Holy Ghost within him
[57:07] but he didn't put him in the body of
[57:09] Christ because the least in the kingdom
[57:11] was greater than he is look John said
[57:19] that the Holy Ghost had not yet come for
[57:21] the Jesus had not been horrified what
[57:24] about it Church yeah I know what caused
[57:27] me to fall in popularity as you see I'm
[57:30] repeating things now that I repeated
[57:32] Sunday that I repeated the Sunday before
[57:34] in the Sunday before in the Sunday
[57:36] before and you're getting tired of
[57:37] hearing it
[57:40] well then you know what that makes it
[57:42] you don't know what I'm talking about
[57:45] if you get tired of here I never get
[57:48] tired of hearing anybody preaching on
[57:49] water baptism I get so I get so enjoyed
[57:54] with somebody just preaching the message
[57:55] of water baptism don't you you know why
[57:59] cuz I've been about that three times one
[58:03] time Father Son the Holy Ghost
[58:04] next time Lord Jesus Christ and then I
[58:06] got to go to Israel and was baptized in
[58:08] the River Jordan in the name of the Lord
[58:10] Jesus Christ I enjoy hearing people talk
[58:13] about one God
[58:16] I enjoy ministers preaching about their
[58:19] own salvation and the way they came
[58:25] I'm gonna get both heard that before
[58:28] well you stick around here you probably
[58:33] heard some more
[58:37] now what about it their disciples off
[58:45] the third seal you can be sanctified
[58:50] without the justification you'll be
[58:51] justified right you can be sanctified
[58:53] without receiving the Holy Ghost the
[58:55] disciples in st. John 17:17 was
[58:58] sanctified in power given and given
[59:00] power to cast out devils and still
[59:03] didn't have the Holy Ghost see they had
[59:06] to go up to Pentecost and wait till the
[59:08] Holy Ghost came that's where Judas
[59:11] showed his colors now remember the
[59:15] scripture acts 1 and 8 but you shall
[59:20] receive power Jesus speaking to the
[59:22] disciples but you shall receive power
[59:24] after the Holy Ghost is come upon you go
[59:29] up to Jerusalem he said and wait well we
[59:33] got some good old bad news Upton in
[59:35] Jerusalem lately cold what did they say
[59:38] your profits weren't have done it he
[59:41] said that man said he said well I think
[59:44] we got it we just take it by faith he
[59:47] said somebody stood up and said but we
[59:49] ain't got what he said
[59:50] we ain't got the power from on high and
[59:53] like I've always treated you don't like
[59:56] that but what was the easiest way of
[1:00:00] saying it when you said you ain't got
[1:00:02] the Holy Ghost cause you ain't got the
[1:00:03] power from on high
[1:00:04] see he'll be the first one go out the
[1:00:05] door and start preaching then they
[1:00:11] turned around sit down and shut up
[1:00:13] right go they wasn't going out when the
[1:00:18] Holy Ghost came out to door they went
[1:00:20] searching for anybody to preach to
[1:00:23] right what about it so then we're up to
[1:00:30] the point
[1:00:38] let's read these now and get just a
[1:00:40] little bit so let's start with number 11
[1:00:45] number 10 is where it says in acts 1 & 8
[1:00:48] let's go to number 11 let's get a few of
[1:00:50] them then I'll quit
[1:00:52] this is 142 I would ask you to just do
[1:00:58] this turn to 142 in some learning church
[1:01:04] age you'll have to get you church age
[1:01:06] book and related to that and just read
[1:01:09] about five pages and just see what your
[1:01:18] profits it because they're right here
[1:01:20] copy it off on this paper but angle how
[1:01:24] time let's read not unless y'all won't
[1:01:26] stay till 10 11 o'clock
[1:01:27] I think sarcastic it's true cuz I got
[1:01:33] him right there you just got the notes
[1:01:34] turn over look at him goes from 144 -
[1:01:37] 145 146 147 148 it starts on 144 and
[1:01:43] goes to 148 read it that's now in the
[1:01:47] Samaritan Church ages not this church
[1:01:48] age boomer huh
[1:01:50] now before we leave this subject I want
[1:01:53] to make myself clear on what the baptism
[1:01:57] with the Holy Ghost is according to the
[1:02:01] word it is not according to me it is not
[1:02:08] according to you it has to be according
[1:02:11] to the sayeth the Lord are we are
[1:02:15] falsely led now we've got to stay with
[1:02:24] that because we don't we in bad shape
[1:02:28] okay let's read a couple in between and
[1:02:32] then go back to it remember what we we
[1:02:35] used the Holy Ghost has been so
[1:02:38] incorrectly taught until people don't
[1:02:41] know what it is
[1:02:43] you remember that blasphemous name but
[1:02:47] we need to read that and again that's
[1:02:48] been so incorrectly tall right come on
[1:02:54] now listen what he says here on Oh why
[1:02:58] is that so many people so many
[1:03:00] Christians find it hard to believe that
[1:03:03] live the Christian life that's in 57 if
[1:03:07] you say the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:08] was promised on the day of Pentecost to
[1:03:10] you and your children and to them that
[1:03:12] is a far off even as many as the Lord
[1:03:15] our God shall call the old dry skin just
[1:03:18] burst now you know what he's talking
[1:03:19] about new skin put it in and you just
[1:03:22] lose your sermon and listen if you don't
[1:03:25] believe that the Holy Ghost if you say
[1:03:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[1:03:29] promised on their Pentecost to you and
[1:03:31] to your children now you know what he
[1:03:33] goes on safe because I promise to you
[1:03:34] and me right is that what it says the
[1:03:37] book of Acts all right in their hearts
[1:03:39] of Kult see what's in them that's afar
[1:03:43] off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:03:44] shall call the old dry skins burst open
[1:03:46] and you lose your sermon it doesn't do
[1:03:50] any good and I'm ashamed that
[1:03:52] Pentecostal skins are drying like that
[1:03:55] that's right
[1:03:57] come back to the word now watch what he
[1:03:59] says notice now a new skin he said the
[1:04:02] new iron is put into the new bottles and
[1:04:04] the new skin has all in it flexible then
[1:04:10] when the Holy Spirit comes down and says
[1:04:17] the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the
[1:04:21] same today as it ever was
[1:04:26] now do you agree with that the baptism
[1:04:30] of the Holy Spirit if he's Hebrews 13:8
[1:04:34] then the baptism of the Holy Spirit is
[1:04:36] here today and he's been in every age
[1:04:38] and every time the baptisms been there
[1:04:41] it was the word that was eat down not
[1:04:45] the baptism it stayed Luther and then
[1:04:47] Wessling them had the baptism with a
[1:04:49] hole to go but they had to bring get it
[1:04:51] under the way God brought it for the
[1:04:52] Aged he had to wink it to her ignorant
[1:04:54] but they still got it because they're in
[1:04:57] the body you say are the end of body
[1:05:00] well this is the drawing that your
[1:05:06] prophet mate Paul Iranians Martin
[1:05:11] Columba Luther Wesley in the kingdom
[1:05:16] that enough to solve the problem all
[1:05:20] right shut that no race that now you say
[1:05:25] well that probably doesn't call me huh
[1:05:27] but listen divine healing is the same as
[1:05:30] it ever was the Word of God is preached
[1:05:33] in it ever time the Word of God is
[1:05:35] preached in its power the new skin will
[1:05:38] holler amen
[1:05:40] it'll give away so to the wisdom and
[1:05:42] when all I can't now what do you
[1:05:44] understand what it's saying when the
[1:05:45] Holy Spirit comes down and says the
[1:05:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same
[1:05:50] today as it ever was
[1:05:55] now that's what he's always teaching but
[1:06:00] you're going to hear him say things that
[1:06:01] sound totally contrary to that
[1:06:07] we'll get to them but just remember this
[1:06:10] is your finality he said we've got to
[1:06:14] and this is 154
[1:06:15] this is in part of you reading if you'll
[1:06:17] read all the way down and get it but
[1:06:20] listen
[1:06:24] all right go to number 13 because we
[1:06:26] just we done read this one well we read
[1:06:28] again and not on the wind read this
[1:06:31] we'll read it you know we got them two
[1:06:33] or three times in here all right fire it
[1:06:35] 154
[1:06:36] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:42] now what is it well I believe that
[1:06:47] shouted I cried as float huh
[1:06:50] well I'll be justification with it
[1:06:53] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:59] now he's going to answer it it is the
[1:07:06] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[1:07:09] Christ
[1:07:14] the disciples justified sign five-day
[1:07:16] getting the body of Christ until the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost can you say all about how
[1:07:22] much you believe and what you think
[1:07:23] you've done what you went through until
[1:07:25] you got the baptism the whole ocean
[1:07:26] you're not in the body of Christ
[1:07:33] what is the baptism with the holy go it
[1:07:37] is the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:07:39] body of Christ it is the new birth so
[1:07:45] now we've got that settled what is the
[1:07:46] new birth the new birth is the baptism
[1:07:50] with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:51] what is the baptism when the whole ego
[1:07:53] justification sanctification and the
[1:07:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't go
[1:08:02] and buy pipes those three stages because
[1:08:04] when you try to bypass them three stages
[1:08:06] I'm going back to John for John 14 what
[1:08:11] nine eight forty but is when Jesus when
[1:08:13] he said you must be born again he's got
[1:08:15] to be born of water and spirit now I'm
[1:08:17] gonna go back to a seed and hand you a
[1:08:19] piece of corn and I'm gonna say yeah
[1:08:20] stick that under that rug and let's get
[1:08:23] some corn Dee died awhile you're gonna
[1:08:27] have to have those three listen three
[1:08:31] not works I've got a right here it's not
[1:08:34] three works of the whole ago it's three
[1:08:36] stages of the whole ego it's the Holy
[1:08:40] Ghost that justifies it Holy Ghost is
[1:08:42] sanctified Holy Ghost it baptized
[1:08:44] okay now we got where we're going
[1:08:47] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:49] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:08:52] body of Christ it is the new birth into
[1:08:55] the Spirit of God coming in and filling
[1:08:57] you after you have repented having heard
[1:09:02] his word now listen and been baptized in
[1:09:07] water as an answer of a good conscience
[1:09:09] toward God so what is the baptism of the
[1:09:15] Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] you don't have to bring this up but it
[1:09:23] can if they want to but I'll read it
[1:09:25] questions and answers on the seals each
[1:09:28] one of those ages only taking a dip into
[1:09:30] the holdest into this Holy Spirit
[1:09:32] justification is the work of the Holy
[1:09:34] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[1:09:36] Holy Spirit but the baptism what is the
[1:09:38] Holy Spirit
[1:09:43] what is the baptism when Holger
[1:09:45] it's a baptism of the Holy Spirit after
[1:09:48] you've been justified and sanctified
[1:09:55] justification because you believe is not
[1:09:57] the baptism with old ago sanctification
[1:09:59] cause you believe is not the baptism
[1:10:01] with all that goes okay he goes on to
[1:10:10] cover then let's see where did we get to
[1:10:17] go to number 15 because I love this one
[1:10:22] the order no it is from the future home
[1:10:25] paragraph 86 how that God makes it plain
[1:10:29] to us and we're gonna use this but you
[1:10:32] know what he's talking about and if that
[1:10:34] wasn't a great confirmation good a great
[1:10:37] loving blessing from God when I see this
[1:10:40] and see that sense of boy first time
[1:10:45] ever Christ dealt with me I've still
[1:10:50] always taught those three stages of
[1:10:53] grace notice it's not true now when we
[1:10:58] get into things later that brother
[1:11:00] Branham says this and says this remember
[1:11:03] that remember these things I could put
[1:11:10] that title on the message now remember
[1:11:12] what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:13] brother Branham it is the Spirit of God
[1:11:16] baptizing you into the body after you
[1:11:18] have been relieved after you've accepted
[1:11:21] Christ after you've been sanctified
[1:11:23] you're filled with the baptism of the
[1:11:25] Holy Spirit
[1:11:27] and he said from the beginning I've
[1:11:29] always taught that so now when it comes
[1:11:32] up later that sounds like contrary to
[1:11:34] what he's saying remember that's what he
[1:11:38] said
[1:11:47] three processors so when he said I
[1:11:51] believe you get eternal life when you
[1:11:53] believe it's gonna have to be brought
[1:11:56] into that state
[1:12:07] I believe that when you believe you get
[1:12:10] eternal life that's when you truly
[1:12:16] believe not make believe truly believe
[1:12:25] what we got
[1:12:30] No
[1:12:34] last three messages of the life three
[1:12:37] ages completes the birth
[1:12:40] okay let's don't go to that let's go 14
[1:12:42] let's go to 16 16 is God's provided way
[1:12:46] of healing said when a man is born again
[1:12:50] he's three elements that he has to go
[1:12:53] through water blood spirit justification
[1:12:58] by faith believing on the Lord
[1:13:00] sanctification that life being cleaned
[1:13:04] up and the baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[1:13:07] three works of grace one grace notice
[1:13:14] justification by faith sanctification
[1:13:16] through the blood and the baptism of the
[1:13:18] Holy Ghost then he explains the baby so
[1:13:20] he's got it you got to hold that now
[1:13:22] keep that thought go to the next one he
[1:13:24] swore by himself he said that was
[1:13:30] justification same case the baptism with
[1:13:31] Holy Ghost not three different
[1:13:33] dispensations not three works of grace
[1:13:37] but one work in three different
[1:13:42] manifestation now quote the Prophet he
[1:13:46] said justification makes way for
[1:13:48] sanctification sanctification makes way
[1:13:51] for the baptism with the Holy go it's
[1:13:52] all got to be God through those through
[1:13:55] stages you don't get it in one stage
[1:13:59] I've heard him preach that in this
[1:14:01] message and I don't agree with it I've
[1:14:03] heard him preaching this message that
[1:14:05] Luther just had one stage and he went
[1:14:07] through I don't agree with that I don't
[1:14:11] care if you can bring me a quote that
[1:14:12] looks like that I know what he said if
[1:14:15] you don't go through three stages you're
[1:14:17] not born again he ain't gonna sort cut
[1:14:20] it for nobody everybody's got the same
[1:14:23] way getting into the kingdom right see
[1:14:27] not three different dispensations not
[1:14:30] three works of grace but one work and
[1:14:31] three different manifestation going to
[1:14:33] the next one the next one is explaining
[1:14:36] simply where you'll keep it in your mind
[1:14:38] about the dedication of a building how
[1:14:39] that your soul body and spirit and your
[1:14:42] three compartments know God dwells in
[1:14:44] three God's perfect injury the church is
[1:14:46] perfect in three
[1:14:48] and what does he come to your solo body
[1:14:49] in spirit who got the three things so
[1:14:52] he's got to deal with you and the three
[1:14:53] things to get the new birth and the
[1:14:56] church is perfected through
[1:14:57] justification sanctification and the
[1:15:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] then you're sealed so you're not sealed
[1:15:05] of justification you're not sealed at
[1:15:07] sanctification you're not sealed until
[1:15:11] the Holy Ghost comes on you for the day
[1:15:13] of your Redemption that's once purged by
[1:15:16] the blood of Jesus Christ has no more
[1:15:18] desire of sin you pass from death unto
[1:15:20] life okay
[1:15:21] go ahead to the next one the life's
[1:15:26] remakes are just a same kids baptism
[1:15:28] over that completed the birth that order
[1:15:30] be enough I'm just bringing it from the
[1:15:32] body to make up the new to make up the
[1:15:34] birth now you ought to understand what
[1:15:36] he's talking about the last three
[1:15:37] messages you got with justification
[1:15:41] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:15:43] ghost the lifestream messages the life's
[1:15:45] research ages forms the complete birth
[1:15:48] all right so he's tying to ages the
[1:15:51] birth and everything together all right
[1:15:53] let's see if we can get at least one
[1:15:55] more what is that number 19 we are
[1:16:04] number 20 hey we're doing pretty good
[1:16:08] and look what happens Israel in the
[1:16:12] church now here he comes torn ribbon
[1:16:14] torn to pieces
[1:16:15] he sold what to God God blessed it and
[1:16:17] then his soul returned back in the form
[1:16:19] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:16:22] comes into every believer to sanctify
[1:16:24] cleaned up the mind cleaned up the heart
[1:16:25] and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:27] there here and there when the Holy Ghost
[1:16:29] is given out in the same Holy Spirit
[1:16:31] they brought the body of Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] over the grave will rapture yeah now
[1:16:36] where does it come from the Holy Ghost
[1:16:38] comes back to you the baptism with holes
[1:16:40] in the form of the soul of God the soul
[1:16:47] of God comes and lives in you because
[1:16:48] eternal life
[1:16:51] are you listening okay
[1:16:56] the next he goes through in perfection
[1:16:58] talking about well let's read death
[1:17:03] imperfection the message he's talking
[1:17:05] about the Corinthians and said by one
[1:17:07] spirit 21 yeah okay because the human
[1:17:11] spirit was alive the higher line of life
[1:17:14] than the animal but no other animal
[1:17:17] spirit could come back if you got the
[1:17:19] spirit of some ancestor a spiritualism
[1:17:23] but God Himself came that his own spirit
[1:17:26] which is the highest line of spirit
[1:17:29] there is can come back by the form of
[1:17:32] the baptism of the holy spirit to the
[1:17:36] worshiper through the blood of Jesus
[1:17:38] Christ and take him into the body right
[1:17:42] he's safe he's in the body okay give me
[1:17:51] just a minute
[1:17:57] I mean
[1:18:00] okay let's go for just a little go to 22
[1:18:05] we're still reading in the church age
[1:18:08] book movie back on par page 154 what is
[1:18:11] the baptism with the holy spirit is a
[1:18:12] spirit of God baptizing the body of
[1:18:14] Christ it is a new birth is the Spirit
[1:18:15] of God coming and filling you after you
[1:18:17] repented having heard his word and been
[1:18:19] baptized in water as an answer of a good
[1:18:22] conscience toward God now this is a
[1:18:24] continuation what you've got there is a
[1:18:27] continuation what we have just set forth
[1:18:31] would be much easier for all to
[1:18:33] understand if all believe the doctrine
[1:18:37] of the oneness of the Godhead now do you
[1:18:41] see why that they're arguing over the
[1:18:42] new birth come on is that clear why are
[1:18:46] they arguing over the new birth with 900
[1:18:49] syphillis seeing it because of what they
[1:18:52] don't have they understand another one
[1:18:54] that's in the Godhead if they had that
[1:18:59] it wouldn't be argued about it if they
[1:19:03] had any sense
[1:19:05] you remember my statement Horton brother
[1:19:07] mol tonight he said what do you believe
[1:19:09] I said one God in three persons he said
[1:19:12] would you mind explaining that I said
[1:19:13] well you know we just got to say it was
[1:19:15] a garden three-person he said you just
[1:19:17] as much of Trinitarian is anybody else
[1:19:18] here I said explain yourself sir he said
[1:19:22] if Father Son and Holy Ghost is three
[1:19:25] persons you're just as Trinity is
[1:19:26] anybody I said I don't believe that no
[1:19:28] more I didn't have to study weeks and
[1:19:32] months and I didn't have to go back to
[1:19:33] my school of theology I went to an e
[1:19:37] ology to find out what was going on
[1:19:43] listen the reason you've got to
[1:19:46] misunderstanding may I put it as - any
[1:19:49] doctrine in this message may I do it
[1:19:52] with that any doctrine it's the message
[1:19:53] the reason you don't have the understand
[1:19:55] if the people don't understand is cuz
[1:19:56] they don't understand the oneness with
[1:19:58] the Godhead how can you have two souls
[1:20:01] under the one God teaching of the
[1:20:04] correctness how can you have river
[1:20:08] Jordan that Jesus wouldn't got until the
[1:20:10] River Jordan under the teaching of
[1:20:13] oneness not one that's like that he said
[1:20:16] I resent that he said but I'm one this
[1:20:20] one true and living God look for there
[1:20:24] are not three persons in that Godhead
[1:20:26] but one thus listen thus we are not born
[1:20:33] again by the spirit of life of Jesus
[1:20:37] coming in and then subsequent which
[1:20:40] means sometimes are after subsequent to
[1:20:44] that the Holy Spirit coming in to give
[1:20:46] us power he said we don't believe that
[1:20:50] but we're going to read where your
[1:20:51] prophet says it that you get eternal
[1:20:54] life and then you believe for power
[1:20:56] coming from heaven we're gonna have to
[1:20:58] find out what he's talking about because
[1:21:01] remember he's got to go back to where
[1:21:03] his statement he made is he's a prophet
[1:21:05] he's got to go back to the statement he
[1:21:07] made in the future huh they always talk
[1:21:08] to three processes come on
[1:21:15] listen they told us we're coming in to
[1:21:18] go as power if that were true it was
[1:21:21] true now that you can get the born-again
[1:21:24] experience and then you get the Holy
[1:21:26] Ghost that's coming to give us power if
[1:21:29] that were true why are we dis honoring
[1:21:32] the father but not giving him a part in
[1:21:35] our complete salvation whereas salvation
[1:21:39] is of the Lord and there are three lords
[1:21:41] then he father must have something to do
[1:21:44] - but surely it can be seen that Jesus
[1:21:49] made this very clear that it was
[1:21:54] he and he alone who is God and it is he
[1:21:59] and he alone who is coming into the
[1:22:01] believer st. John 14:16 that the father
[1:22:05] will send another comforter but verse 17
[1:22:09] says that he Jesus dwelleth in them and
[1:22:11] should be in them later and those come
[1:22:15] in verse 18 he says that he will come to
[1:22:18] them in verse 23 and speaking to the
[1:22:21] disciples he said we father and son will
[1:22:24] come unto Him thus it's the Father Son
[1:22:27] and Holy Ghost all coming in at the one
[1:22:30] time for it's one person comprising the
[1:22:34] Godhead wonderful when I got the Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost and then I got Jesus watch him
[1:22:49] one person comprising the Godhead that
[1:22:54] Advent are happening took place at
[1:22:57] Pentecost there aren't two comings of
[1:23:01] the Spirit just one that can come in
[1:23:05] three stages of justification the same
[1:23:07] case the baptism with home go but it's
[1:23:08] only one salvation
[1:23:13] there's not three comings it's not one
[1:23:16] of them justifying you know sanctifying
[1:23:18] you and feeling you it ain't one of them
[1:23:21] didn't we a little bit down here at the
[1:23:23] bottom of the pyramid
[1:23:24] you get moping in and then another
[1:23:26] another God takes over coming up a
[1:23:28] little father and then a father comes
[1:23:29] one up here what kind of water where are
[1:23:31] we yeah but you were just arrogant one
[1:23:37] of these days you'll Pat me on the back
[1:23:39] and glory say thank you for being
[1:23:40] arrogant but you know what when I get
[1:23:45] there I'll be just like a man said to me
[1:23:46] one time he said brother Dale I'm sorry
[1:23:48] for the way I've treated you
[1:23:50] I said you're forgiven for you ever done
[1:23:52] it and I'm in it I said before you ever
[1:24:00] done it you was forgiven because I have
[1:24:03] no feelings for just anybody
[1:24:11] maybe one day days you know maybe one
[1:24:13] day days we're gonna preaching what do
[1:24:13] you turn alive here you know what is
[1:24:15] eternal life is everybody know what are
[1:24:19] you turn alive here oh thank you
[1:24:21] you got it you turned life is living for
[1:24:24] others that's what's your prophet said
[1:24:28] living for others not yourself that
[1:24:31] Advent took place at Pentecost aren't
[1:24:33] two comings of the Spirit just one the
[1:24:35] trouble is that the people don't know
[1:24:37] the real truth and they simply believe
[1:24:39] in Jesus for remission of sins but never
[1:24:42] go on to receive the Holy Spirit all
[1:24:48] right I'm gonna have to stop dark
[1:24:51] because if I go to the next he's gonna
[1:24:54] take 45 minutes or more and I don't want
[1:24:57] to do that we'll try to pick it up
[1:25:01] Sunday we'll review and we pick it up
[1:25:04] okay but just remember one thing that
[1:25:08] I've taught you
[1:25:09] that's what I've always taught
[1:25:12] there's just one true and living God
[1:25:15] it's not a Holy Ghost that comes down on
[1:25:18] you and a father that comes down to do
[1:25:20] this and the son slips into you
[1:25:22] somewhere
[1:25:24] he just said that that Advent took place
[1:25:27] at penticoff it was a Father Son and
[1:25:29] Holy Ghost coming in at one time now may
[1:25:34] I repeat what I said while ago those
[1:25:36] people of the 3000 outside went through
[1:25:39] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:25:41] when the whole ego and the very person
[1:25:44] of Jesus Christ came within them to give
[1:25:46] them eternal life and put them into the
[1:25:49] body of Christ same thing happened the
[1:25:53] canoe you said house the same Holy Ghost
[1:25:58] the Bible says or what say they can we
[1:26:00] forbid that good water or baptism what
[1:26:03] it said see and they receive the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost we did at the beginning there's
[1:26:09] never been but one baptism of the Holy
[1:26:11] Delta there's never been but one way
[1:26:14] into the body of Christ they don't
[1:26:16] change with the ages in time whatever
[1:26:19] started is 1/10 is the counterpart for
[1:26:21] everyone so whatever you think I don't
[1:26:23] care I'm sorry
[1:26:25] you say well I don't see how Luther and
[1:26:27] then went through this with Westar then
[1:26:28] went through them if you're living back
[1:26:31] there you'd shout glory hallelujah
[1:26:34] whatever God done to do it he done it
[1:26:37] because you can't get into the body of
[1:26:39] Christ without justification
[1:26:41] sanctification and the baptism when the
[1:26:43] Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] anything else is impartation that's why
[1:26:47] you foolish virgin will get eternal life
[1:26:49] given unto that's the field field you
[1:26:51] will be eternal I've given unto with
[1:26:53] 144,000 gives eternal life here that's
[1:26:58] where those Old Testament Saints he's
[1:27:01] gonna come up and they're gonna get
[1:27:04] eternal life into their soul and they
[1:27:09] were the ones that rejected Christ
[1:27:12] you think justification and a wonderful
[1:27:15] message if the fact that they was the
[1:27:18] hunt that the fish feel Jew comes up to
[1:27:21] the point that they're saved that's the
[1:27:23] most wonderful thought of justification
[1:27:25] you could ever think
[1:27:27] that God would back away that's where we
[1:27:32] don't we don't believe it we don't
[1:27:36] believe that Church right over there we
[1:27:37] won't you know you want to throw it at
[1:27:39] me if I say something you want to throw
[1:27:41] it at me well brother Dale don't thank
[1:27:43] them people don't you ever think I don't
[1:27:44] think then people are over can be saved
[1:27:46] then people right over there could be
[1:27:47] saved at the white throne judgment and
[1:27:52] be given eternal life and me and you
[1:27:55] stand out because of our sarcastic
[1:27:57] attitude and our ways we're talking
[1:27:59] about them we could stand there at the
[1:28:00] white throne and be cast into hell I'll
[1:28:04] believe that brother Dale we didn't get
[1:28:06] bored again cause Abel one way to bypass
[1:28:09] it the new birth and the baptism of the
[1:28:14] Holy Ghost and being born again is the
[1:28:17] same experience now listen to what the
[1:28:26] statement I made it to other day yeah
[1:28:29] the round said receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:28:32] without a sensation did he say that he
[1:28:36] said that was one of the mysteries for
[1:28:38] the last night but you know what
[1:28:40] he never said you can receive the
[1:28:42] baptism when the Holy Ghost without an
[1:28:44] experience I want you to bring me that
[1:28:47] quote I'll quit preaching the day you
[1:28:55] can bring me these statements because
[1:28:57] I'm a false prophet too so you can't
[1:29:03] have the new birth without an experience
[1:29:06] but you can have it without a sensation
[1:29:10] but around them never done away with any
[1:29:13] form of movements or ideas or thoughts
[1:29:16] of people believing it
[1:29:20] he said lay under the spout listen to
[1:29:23] him he said lay under the spout and one
[1:29:24] day you'll come for speaking in trunk
[1:29:29] you know what he was encouraging laying
[1:29:31] under the spout wouldn't it this is one
[1:29:39] thing I've always helped with in my
[1:29:41] heart to try to get people to see God is
[1:29:44] a good card and he'll come to me and you
[1:29:48] and he'll come to our ways of thinking
[1:29:52] not deal do you know training you'll
[1:29:55] come down into our little bitty thoughts
[1:29:57] and her little bitty ideas and bring us
[1:30:01] to himself and give us a new birth
[1:30:07] listen to the Prophet who is listening
[1:30:10] another day where he had to bunch of
[1:30:11] children they come up the altar and he
[1:30:14] prayed for the whole group of children
[1:30:15] and he said see how are you believers he
[1:30:19] says you got eternal life he never
[1:30:22] mentioned no baptisms he didn't go into
[1:30:24] all of the things but he said you die
[1:30:28] you go into heaven
[1:30:35] that church as I said right over there
[1:30:37] then people could wind up and be our
[1:30:39] condemnation and we're thinking we're
[1:30:44] better than they are
[1:30:46] come on musicians that's thinking we're
[1:30:51] better than they are
[1:30:56] this in church it's about time for us to
[1:30:59] get settled on one time I believe in a
[1:31:04] definite experience for the baptism of
[1:31:06] the Holy listen I believe it this way I
[1:31:09] believe in a definite experience now
[1:31:12] because we're not back there see when
[1:31:15] they were back dire that three thousand
[1:31:16] outside they went through justification
[1:31:18] sanctification the baptism the whole
[1:31:19] ghost under one message but brother
[1:31:21] Branham I'll read it to you if you read
[1:31:23] on over there only 148 right in there he
[1:31:26] said very few people ever believe all
[1:31:27] the way under receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:31:30] very few people will ever leave that far
[1:31:33] but you see let me get started just
[1:31:39] believe it
[1:31:40] and then let me say lord help my
[1:31:43] unbelief
[1:31:44] well from there I'm not gonna say I'm
[1:31:47] lost nobody asked you to anybody ever
[1:31:54] ask you to say you lost that should have
[1:31:57] been settled today you knew yours lost
[1:32:01] this shouldn't be any problem should
[1:32:04] have been settled in because listen if
[1:32:08] you your sins are forgiven like Wade was
[1:32:10] bringing Wednesday done Sunday if your
[1:32:14] sins are forgiven you'll never have to
[1:32:16] answer for that sin right I don't care
[1:32:20] who we are I don't care what you wind up
[1:32:22] inhale and bust it wide open but you
[1:32:24] ain't going to hell for them sins if you
[1:32:26] repent because God is just and will
[1:32:30] forgive you for that sin so then god
[1:32:35] this is the one way to find out where
[1:32:37] the God's talking to your the devil with
[1:32:40] a little voice comes to you and me
[1:32:42] preaching this series so I'm warning you
[1:32:44] a little voice will come to you and say
[1:32:46] you're lost you need to be saved just
[1:32:50] stay back to that little voice this I
[1:32:52] might not be where I'm supposed to be I
[1:32:55] might not be saved but there's one thing
[1:32:58] about it ain't lost
[1:33:01] because you did think enough of me to
[1:33:04] come to me
[1:33:05] Nicodemus wouldn't lost come on brother
[1:33:09] Brian said Nicodemus in Khmer you would
[1:33:12] get eternal life
[1:33:13] come on there wouldn't lost if God
[1:33:17] forgives your sins you're not lost you
[1:33:20] may not be where you need to be you may
[1:33:22] need a whole lot more because just
[1:33:25] because the sins are forgiven don't mean
[1:33:27] if you're born again either
[1:33:31] so that voice comes to you and says
[1:33:33] you're lost just say I'm gonna agree
[1:33:36] with you to a certain degree there but
[1:33:38] I'm surely not lost cuz if I was lost
[1:33:39] you wouldn't be fooling with me
[1:33:41] don't you talk to it like that but
[1:33:45] brother Dale I don't talk to the devil
[1:33:46] to you about 99% of the time I'm talking
[1:33:48] to him I guess boy or an odd person what
[1:33:55] you gonna tell me you're talking to God
[1:33:56] all day long I'm gonna tell you you're a
[1:33:59] locker
[1:34:00] is that enough and Liars don't have no
[1:34:03] part in heaven so they don't need in
[1:34:06] lying about something my life in Tobruk
[1:34:10] that one day there was going down the
[1:34:13] road and me and him look at his life and
[1:34:16] talk about each other than things and I
[1:34:17] said brother mode you know what the
[1:34:19] divorce telling me to do right now
[1:34:20] he said one I said his voice telling me
[1:34:22] to run into that tree dunya on your side
