[0:01] God bless you all and greetings to you
[0:06] so we've been talking about communion
[0:08] the last uh
[0:09] many lessons and that's what I kind of
[0:13] want to I'm going to try to bring it to
[0:16] a stop coach to a hall and then uh
[0:19] brother Ryan I'll take the next Sunday
[0:20] school lesson and I believe or the
[0:22] Wade's gonna
[0:23] start up after that so um just kind of
[0:27] finishing up at the culmination which is
[0:30] the cloud so we'll talk about that with
[0:32] us a little bit this morning hey you'll
[0:34] notice in that scripture we just read
[0:35] Numbers Chapter 11. that Moses got to a
[0:38] place where he's like I can't do this
[0:40] alone I need some help and you know
[0:43] that's really the kind of place that
[0:45] every Minister brother Dale is is trying
[0:48] to get the people where we don't rely so
[0:50] much on the ministry but every person in
[0:54] the church should be led by the spirit
[0:57] we we hear the word and and and of
[1:00] course that's why we come to church so
[1:03] that we grow in Grace and knowledge and
[1:05] we grow to a place to where we're more
[1:07] and more and more and communion with God
[1:09] but we're the the whole church is
[1:13] supposed to be the lead of the spirit
[1:14] that's right and then Moses God said I'm
[1:18] gonna I'm gonna put the spirit that's on
[1:20] you into amen all of these 70 men that's
[1:25] right and then they can take they can
[1:27] they'll they'll be in community they'll
[1:28] know what to do they'll understand what
[1:31] is going to happen what what I want done
[1:33] right and when God did that did you
[1:35] notice he came in the cloud because the
[1:37] cloud is in the presence the cloud
[1:40] identifies that God is on the scene now
[1:43] I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:46] so let's let's go back and look at
[1:49] Matthew 19 3 6.
[1:52] because you know you read through these
[1:54] scriptures that we've read for years and
[1:56] years and and we looked at it one way
[1:58] but now we're talking about communion so
[2:01] maybe just kind of steer your thinking
[2:03] to look at it a different way the
[2:05] Pharisees also came unto him talking
[2:07] about marriage divorce attempting him
[2:09] and saying unto him is it lawful for a
[2:11] man to put his wife or his wife for
[2:13] every cause now when we read this let's
[2:15] think about Christ and his church not so
[2:18] much you and your wife are the different
[2:21] problems that we know of and things like
[2:23] that but we're talking about Christ in
[2:25] the church right because whatever what
[2:28] if God put us away every time we stumble
[2:30] and fail you know
[2:33] my goodness
[2:34] can we feel no harm no horrible [ __ ] but
[2:37] and he answered and said unto them have
[2:40] you not read
[2:41] that he which made them at the beginning
[2:43] made them male and female right and said
[2:46] for this call shall a man leave father
[2:49] and mother
[2:51] and shall what
[2:53] cleave to his wife I love it join
[2:57] himself together Christ and his bride
[3:01] until they are who understand they're
[3:03] together and John turned to see the
[3:05] voice and it was a it was God and bride
[3:07] form he heard the voice the bride
[3:10] speaking the same thing
[3:12] this is Christ in his bride or the R1
[3:16] for this call shall a man leave father
[3:18] and mother and shall cleave to his wife
[3:20] and Nate twain shall be one flesh
[3:22] whether they are no more Twain but one
[3:25] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[3:28] together let not man put us under
[3:31] when God gives you the Holy Ghost there
[3:33] is not one thing in the world that can
[3:35] tear you apart from the love of God
[3:38] and what did God do he came down he left
[3:41] it all he left all that glory on heaven
[3:43] and came down to get us to bring us back
[3:46] into fellowship with him and it's really
[3:49] as simple as that which I think many
[3:51] times we try to make the gospel way more
[3:53] complicated than it really is but God
[3:56] didn't came down to Glory from Glory
[3:57] that stone that came out to put himself
[4:00] in us to tear out all the all the the
[4:03] draws and everything to bring us into
[4:05] fellowship with him that's right so we
[4:07] can go in the Rapture that's all that's
[4:09] how it works of course you know and what
[4:12] I'm going to talk about this morning is
[4:13] a minister can get up and and tell you
[4:16] exactly what it is you can read it on
[4:18] the books and the tapes but until the
[4:21] spirit comes and quickens it it won't
[4:23] come to life in your life that's right
[4:25] and that's the goal get not just listen
[4:29] to Somebody talk about it but getting
[4:31] communion with God because communion is
[4:33] the whole basis for the Christian walk
[4:35] it's the whole basis for everything the
[4:37] gospel is based on old communion
[4:42] and comedian is bringing together
[4:44] bringing two things together two things
[4:46] that are at enmity
[4:48] where there's a girl fixed and bringing
[4:50] them together so there's not anything
[4:51] between them anymore and this is that
[4:54] that uh sermon that last time I was
[4:56] talking about is so uh dear to me what
[4:58] was the Holy Ghost given for and if you
[5:00] if you go back and listen to this
[5:01] brother random clears up a lot of things
[5:04] about the Statue of perfect man he just
[5:06] goes through uh lots of different topics
[5:09] that are are wonderful
[5:11] God poured himself into Christ correct
[5:13] Christ pulled himself into the church
[5:15] therefore now watch at that day you will
[5:17] know that I am in the father and you are
[5:19] in me and I am in you at that day you'll
[5:21] know it for it's the whole thing is one
[5:23] Plan of Redemption coming down that God
[5:25] coming back to live in and dwell with
[5:28] and commune to his people as he did at
[5:30] the beginning
[5:31] now then
[5:33] as soon as he gets his church in
[5:35] speaking conditions
[5:37] he gives his church to a place that he
[5:39] can flow himself through and love and
[5:42] persuade and fellowship
[5:44] then they'll come and even he'll take
[5:48] his church back to where it left him and
[5:50] back to an Eden again there where where
[5:52] it fell now that's where it made its
[5:54] first start of fall that's where it'll
[5:55] be taken right back with every Clean
[5:58] Slate of redemption now that's what
[6:01] that's the goal that's what God is
[6:02] trying to do right welcome sister
[6:05] glad to have you will
[6:08] so we're talking about communion this
[6:10] morning
[6:12] and your that bringing together starts
[6:16] at the new birth and and it's a little
[6:19] bit easy to talk about let's go brother
[6:20] Wayne's it's been a whole year talking
[6:22] about the journey from faith and
[6:23] communion and and and that joining
[6:27] together how's the New Birth start well
[6:30] first you hear the truth and then the
[6:32] spirit comes and quickens it that's
[6:34] right and makes it alive
[6:36] you take these two things the truth and
[6:39] that all down through the Old Testament
[6:40] they heard the truth they Moses told
[6:43] them the truth uh Joshua all down all
[6:46] the prophets
[6:47] but
[6:48] uh what the Jews had turned it into was
[6:51] just do's and don'ts right a legalism of
[6:54] a washing of pots and pans and I suppose
[6:56] I can't drag carry his dick on on the
[6:59] Sabbath further than this amount of
[7:00] yardage and whatnot and but it what
[7:03] needed to happen was the spirit needed
[7:05] to come and and and Quicken that truth
[7:08] that's right then you got because you
[7:10] know to get a seed you gotta have two
[7:12] things you got to have uh the male and
[7:15] the female and it joins together and
[7:18] then you can have something that's
[7:19] reproducible
[7:20] something that we can reproduce and
[7:23] that's why minister is not supposed to
[7:24] minister until they have that truth
[7:27] Quicken on them so that it can reproduce
[7:29] so that the gospel can be spoken and you
[7:33] can give it out because that's you know
[7:35] that's what brother Brown said the
[7:36] Greater Works that the church would do
[7:38] would be to impart eternal life and how
[7:41] can you do that if the spirit has not
[7:43] quickened the truth and is living inside
[7:45] of you that you can give it out and
[7:47] virtue
[7:48] so in John chapter 4 23 and 24 we kind
[7:52] of touched on this last time as Jesus
[7:54] was talking to the woman of the world
[7:56] the hour cometh and now is when the true
[7:58] worshipers shall worship the father in
[8:00] spirit
[8:01] and in truth that's right it'll be a
[8:04] quick and Truth it'll be something
[8:06] that's alive
[8:07] for the father seeketh such to worship
[8:10] Him God is a spirit
[8:13] and they that worship Him must worship
[8:16] Him in spirit and in truth and then
[8:19] Ephesians 1 13 and we also trusted after
[8:22] that he heard the word of Truth first
[8:25] you heard it the gospel of your
[8:27] salvation in whom also after that you
[8:29] believe you were sealed with that Holy
[8:31] Spirit of promise that Holy Spirit came
[8:33] on that truth and quickened it and made
[8:35] it come alive and now you're sealed
[8:37] you're part of God that's because that's
[8:38] Spiritual Living That's right The Same
[8:40] Spirit just like that story we just read
[8:42] in Numbers Chapter 11. Jesus is standing
[8:45] there like Moses I I want these people
[8:49] to have the same Spirit that's in me and
[8:53] that same Spirit came down in a cloud
[8:56] and in part of itself when little licks
[8:59] of fire on everyone there in that room
[9:01] as as they were they were praying they
[9:04] had they held the truth they had heard
[9:06] the truth for three and a half years and
[9:08] then the Spirit came down and made it
[9:10] alive
[9:11] and then it can grow right that's why
[9:14] the new birth is so important right and
[9:17] we can talk about the statute of perfect
[9:18] man and and all these deep things the
[9:21] third pool and The Headstone but if you
[9:23] don't have the new birth because it's
[9:25] not uh a a ministers can hammer on you
[9:28] all day long but until that word becomes
[9:31] quickened by communion with a personal
[9:33] relationship with God and that Spirit
[9:35] comes down and makes it alive that
[9:37] that's what makes makes you move up the
[9:40] statue of perfect man that ladder of God
[9:42] is God doing it that's right it's not a
[9:44] work that you do that's right but it's
[9:46] God doing it that's right you've got to
[9:49] have that consuming fire living on the
[9:51] inside
[9:52] to bring it to pass now here's what
[9:54] brother Ryan said in message Oneness
[9:56] what happened I said all right I want to
[9:58] ask you something the woman has no egg
[10:00] she has no C
[10:02] he said not only he said I see and she
[10:04] had no seed it takes a union to make a
[10:06] scene is that a right doctor it has to
[10:08] be if you got a whole lot of dirt pulp
[10:09] out there out here didn't have no life
[10:11] in it and planted it out here
[10:13] it would never come up lay there and raw
[10:15] and you couldn't plant the life without
[10:17] having to poop so you see the whole
[10:18] thing as a human it starts from a unit
[10:21] being born again first you you get a
[10:24] union of spirit and Truth at Faith and
[10:26] all the way up being born again like
[10:28] Peter said all the way up you need some
[10:30] more true and the spirit quiz that and
[10:32] you get some more true and the spirit
[10:34] quick as that's man up and up and up and
[10:36] up until you're getting closer and
[10:38] closer to God Amen and and and believe
[10:41] in this word
[10:43] I'm trying to tell you now about Christ
[10:46] and the church it's a union see if the
[10:48] woman is the seed of herself and she
[10:50] doesn't need the mail she can have her
[10:51] baby herself but she can't be she can't
[10:54] have the bathing until she's been with a
[10:55] male because it takes the two together
[10:56] to make a sleep is that right plan to
[10:59] see you with no life in it see what will
[11:00] happen
[11:01] It's gotta be it's Gotta Be dermatized
[11:03] and when we know uh many many that have
[11:06] have heard brother Dale preached you
[11:08] know first there's a gene an attribute
[11:10] in the God and has to come down through
[11:11] that germ to a seed and that's the
[11:14] progress the process Gene germs seed and
[11:18] then it can grow the seed can reproduce
[11:20] itself and
[11:23] so communion bringing together
[11:26] in the mark of the the mark of the bees
[11:28] 1956 brother uh brother Branham said uh
[11:32] it'll never take life until a germ of
[11:33] life has come to it and then he kind of
[11:36] goes through that process that we many
[11:38] of us know also too well the word comes
[11:41] into the mind
[11:42] there's something to consider you know
[11:45] I I feel like many times I you know I I
[11:48] know a lot
[11:50] because we've been studying for for
[11:52] years and we've been listening to the
[11:53] books of the tapes but we got a lot of
[11:55] stuff up here and I know brother brother
[11:57] Dale's mentioned that a lot too that
[11:59] there's a lot in our minds but if that
[12:02] could just drop down in our heart and
[12:04] become real yeah so that's what brother
[12:07] Ram's talking about here you make up
[12:08] your mind about it is that right could
[12:10] that be right well the Bible says so I
[12:12] believe it
[12:14] down into the heart again
[12:16] and then it's a woman then the male sex
[12:19] we are the bride the woman the city goes
[12:21] into the church then the male sex which
[12:23] is the blood cell the blood of Christ is
[12:26] applied and in the blood comes a journal
[12:28] of life that goes into the seed and
[12:29] brings forth a newborn baby crying Abba
[12:32] Father Abba Father my God my God why did
[12:34] I ever do those things
[12:36] my God my God there you are so see it's
[12:39] a you in the whole way up
[12:41] but when you get where this you're
[12:44] standing at believing the world in the
[12:47] head and that's what in this in this
[12:49] church age in this day something's
[12:52] happening that can never happen God the
[12:54] head can come down and Unite with the
[12:56] body join with the body and that's
[12:58] what's going to take us in the Rapture
[12:59] and that is represented the bottom is
[13:01] represented by the cloud the top is
[13:03] represented by Cloud because when you
[13:05] get born again it's the cloud of this
[13:06] presence coming the coming of the Lord
[13:08] and at the top is the cloud of his
[13:11] presence that comes and identifies that
[13:13] he's here to take a church in the
[13:15] direction
[13:16] feel good offset
[13:20] the invisible unit of the bride of
[13:22] Christ
[13:23] he said the first life or your first
[13:26] Union you were joined in at Birth by
[13:29] Nature a natural act a natural human
[13:32] being associated a man a woman together
[13:34] Associated together
[13:37] and sexual Affair which brought to your
[13:39] first life here and that's associated
[13:41] with death sin and death how can you
[13:44] miss seeing the serpency
[13:47] because you were first joined to the
[13:50] devil and God he came down and died on
[13:53] the cross so that you could be he could
[13:55] separate you from get the devil out
[13:57] that's right and join himself to you
[13:59] that's right and begin join unite
[14:03] himself with you you your your first
[14:06] husband had to die right so that you
[14:09] could be married to Christ
[14:11] and and your first Union was all messed
[14:14] up so we've got to be joined to Christ
[14:16] and you're joining him by the new birth
[14:18] of receiving the truth and let that
[14:21] truth be quicker
[14:25] and that's what Jesus was taught God was
[14:28] talking about in Genesis chapter 3 verse
[14:30] 14 to 15 the Lord God said on the
[14:32] serpent because thou has done this Thou
[14:34] Art cursed to belong Callum but every
[14:36] beast of the field for my belly shout
[14:37] thou go and dust shout out eat all the
[14:40] days of our life and I here's that great
[14:43] promise I wonder if this promise has
[14:45] really been quicker than how hard what
[14:47] this is I will put in it I see there
[14:51] when they when they when they took one
[14:53] word off they divided their self they
[14:56] separated themselves from God
[14:58] says there's empathy as Paul explainers
[15:00] in between between man and God because
[15:02] of what they did they're divided now
[15:04] what he's telling the devil is I'm going
[15:06] to put enmity between you
[15:08] and my bride I'll put enmity between
[15:11] thee and the woman then between Nazi the
[15:16] serpency and her seeds the seed which is
[15:18] Christ it shall bruised our head and
[15:21] thou shalt bruise his heel what does the
[15:22] word enmity means if you look it up in
[15:24] strong skin Corners the N word enmity
[15:26] means enemy and now by the new birth God
[15:30] is joining us to where we don't we don't
[15:32] uh we don't fellowship with the things
[15:35] of the world we Paul said it's not we
[15:37] shouldn't even talk about the things
[15:39] that are done in the world it's become
[15:40] uh something that
[15:44] we don't long for we don't long for the
[15:46] things the world we're used to we we uh
[15:49] you know did all the all the bad things
[15:52] and whatnot but now he's made those
[15:55] things an enemy to us
[15:57] and by the by eating the word by
[15:59] feasting on his word we become closer
[16:02] and closer with God those things are are
[16:04] becoming further and further away
[16:07] use the men as an empathy with god with
[16:10] their sin so we were first at enmity
[16:12] with God and now he's bringing us at
[16:15] enmity with the devil and his works
[16:18] First Corinthians 15 25 26 now that word
[16:22] enmity in Greek is translated all
[16:24] through the New Testament as this word
[16:27] and and you you can uh well if you have
[16:30] strong support it's only all that little
[16:32] table out you can search it through but
[16:34] uh this word is the same word as enmity
[16:37] for he must Reign till he accept all
[16:40] enemies
[16:42] under his feet
[16:44] The Last Enemy
[16:46] that shall be destroyed is death
[16:50] that's what we're doing on the Statue of
[16:52] perfect man destroying God is destroying
[16:55] the enmity
[16:56] does that make sense I want everybody
[16:58] yes yeah
[17:00] yeah I wish I could just put it put it
[17:02] straight in but you know
[17:05] and that's that's what he did on the
[17:07] cross
[17:09] he came down from his glory to start the
[17:11] process so communion is is bringing
[17:14] together on the River Jordan the Holy
[17:16] Ghost descended and body shaped like a
[17:17] double point and the voice Came From
[17:19] Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved
[17:20] Son and me I'm well pleased and he was
[17:22] going through the Journey of a Christian
[17:23] of the new birth on up to where uh the
[17:28] cloud appeared on not Transfiguration
[17:30] and said this is my blood son of hearing
[17:32] him now he says speaking conditions
[17:35] why would you expect me to hold a bright
[17:37] Cloud overshadow them on Mount
[17:39] Transfiguration Behold a voice out of
[17:41] the ground we said this is my beloved
[17:42] Son and whom I am well please hear him
[17:45] through gods
[17:47] joining in both at the new birth
[17:50] and at the Capstone
[17:54] and what happened at Sea brother random
[17:57] in the Harvest Time 1964 he's kind of
[17:59] he's typing what happened on the River
[18:00] Jordan with what happens in your life
[18:04] he was Sanctified to begin with by the
[18:06] father then he raised up his hands and
[18:07] here come the devil upon the lamb what
[18:09] was God doing when he put the dove on
[18:11] there he claimed that part of life that
[18:13] was part of the earth the Jesus Seafood
[18:15] like we have in natural
[18:16] okay
[18:17] it was a lot more I think I need to move
[18:19] a little faster and when the man goes
[18:21] into God complete now say what he's
[18:23] trying to do is he's trying to reflect
[18:24] himself that perfect man or woman living
[18:26] by the word see that's that's the Earth
[18:28] that's cleansed he's trying to get
[18:30] himself reflected on a Perfect Bride
[18:34] and remember over in Revelations 21 he
[18:36] said I'll show Thee the Bride of the
[18:38] Lamb's wife and he carried him me away
[18:40] in the spirit to John to a great and
[18:42] high mountain remember last time we
[18:43] looked at how the symbol of a perfect
[18:46] Church a perfect person a perfect City
[18:50] it's all this mountain they're all
[18:53] they're all uh and when he looked at he
[18:55] said I'll show you the Bride of the
[18:56] land's wife and then he showed me in his
[18:57] mouth and he had all the foundations and
[19:00] things that that uh the the church being
[19:02] built upon the word and built upon the
[19:04] apostles and Prophets and all those
[19:06] different things and and look what
[19:08] nothing's going to come in this church
[19:10] in in this city in Revelations 21 27 and
[19:14] there's really no wise
[19:16] enter into it anything that defiles
[19:19] whatsoever worketh Abomination or make
[19:22] us a lie for they which are written in
[19:24] the Lamb's Book of Life why because now
[19:27] the church has been purged the church
[19:29] has been purified there's there's no uh
[19:32] all that
[19:33] false Doctrine there's Purge and nothing
[19:36] nothing's going to come in but only
[19:38] God's truth and remember said if you
[19:42] can't see Christ in every verse of the
[19:44] Bible then you read it again because you
[19:46] miss something and it covers the whole
[19:48] plan just like this mountain of God as
[19:50] revealing his words revealing we should
[19:54] be able to see Christ's word manifest in
[19:56] our own life that Spirit come to that
[19:58] truth come to life and and in in the
[20:00] church and
[20:02] in that New Jerusalem just so that all
[20:05] you can't even get a razor blade between
[20:07] what you believe and what
[20:08] what God's word says
[20:16] last time
[20:19] all right so in the Old Testament this
[20:22] is kind of what I'm getting to so we've
[20:23] got 15 more minutes so we're doing good
[20:27] the cloud in the Old Testament was a
[20:29] symbol you know when when Balaam looked
[20:31] down and he saw he saw the children of
[20:34] Israel down there and there was a they
[20:36] had the
[20:37] all the different components of worship
[20:40] but they had this Pillar of Fire in the
[20:42] cloud because it was a symbol that God
[20:45] was in their midst and it knew all
[20:48] through their journey in the in the in
[20:50] the wilderness they just stayed right
[20:51] behind that cloud and that's what the
[20:53] bride is doing today stay right behind
[20:55] that Vindicated message where we've got
[20:57] a prophet that had the pillar of cloud a
[20:59] picture of it over his head we'll just
[21:01] stay right behind that word and not to
[21:04] deviate to the right of the lift it'll
[21:06] lead us to the goal which is to take a
[21:08] body change
[21:10] and whenever a vote around on the
[21:13] greater than Solomons here in 1963 he
[21:15] said now Jonah knew that when Solomon
[21:17] dedicated the temple God Vindicated his
[21:20] presence at the temple by coming in as
[21:22] the pillar of the cloud
[21:23] and went in and went over behind the
[21:25] holy Place upon The Mercy Seat never the
[21:27] ark
[21:27] and uh how much more we deny under our
[21:30] little circumstance right in the midst
[21:32] of the presence of the great God himself
[21:34] where we see people healed save and fill
[21:36] the Holy Ghost because God pulled out
[21:38] all the stops in this day to show that
[21:40] God was here that God was that's one of
[21:42] the hardest things to convince people
[21:44] that God is still the same yesterday
[21:45] today and forever that he's still alive
[21:47] he's not he's not changed he's still in
[21:48] our midst
[21:50] and second chronicles 5 13-14
[21:54] is the story of of as the retelling of
[21:57] what happened when solemn dedicated the
[21:59] temple they came to pass it came even
[22:02] the passes the trumpeters and singers
[22:04] were as one to make one sound to be
[22:06] heard and praising and thanking the lord
[22:07] and when they lifted up their voice with
[22:08] the trumpets and symbols and instruments
[22:11] of music and praise the Lord saying for
[22:12] he is good for his mercy endureth
[22:14] forever that then the house was filled
[22:16] with a cloud even the house of the Lord
[22:19] so that the priest could not stand to
[22:21] minister by reason of the cloud
[22:24] for the glory of the Lord I feel the
[22:27] house of God
[22:29] had come to fill his Temple
[22:35] and you know Jesus went in a cloud and
[22:37] asked 1 7 11 but ye shall receive power
[22:40] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[22:42] you and a cloud received him out of
[22:44] their sight I'm kind of skipping over
[22:45] this they said why didn't stand you
[22:47] gazing up into heaven the same Jesus
[22:49] which is taken up from it from you into
[22:51] heaven she also come in like manner as
[22:54] you have seen him go into heaven
[22:57] and then we read I look he said I'll not
[23:01] let you talk about the coming of the
[23:02] Lord I'll not leave you comfortable
[23:06] and that's why I was trying to get that
[23:09] together with numbers 11. well that
[23:11] spirit that was on Moses was given out
[23:13] to the people now here's what he's doing
[23:15] he's he's that spirit that was on him to
[23:17] give him power was giving out to the
[23:20] people and it started it started rolling
[23:23] through seven churches that confuses a
[23:25] lot of people when you say well well on
[23:27] the right of that statue of perfect man
[23:29] that said Paul Arenas and Martin
[23:31] Columbus because look what God's doing
[23:33] is down through seven Church ages he's
[23:35] building up a church right and also
[23:37] individually he's building you up that's
[23:39] right
[23:40] that whole process started back then
[23:43] when at the day of Pentecost he came and
[23:45] lived inside began the process of
[23:48] becoming the Lord will you say well the
[23:49] coming of the Lord was supposed to be
[23:50] when when uh God comes back to think of
[23:53] Bride In The Rapture sure
[23:56] he'll come to the Lord is at the bottom
[23:58] and the coming of the Lord is at the top
[23:59] that's right
[24:02] and he came in a cloud numbers 11 12 24
[24:05] 25 and Moses went out and told the
[24:07] people we just read this told the people
[24:08] the words of the Lord and gathered again
[24:11] of the owners of the people and set them
[24:12] around about the Tabernacle and the Lord
[24:14] came down in the cloud and spoke unto
[24:17] him and took of the spirit that was upon
[24:18] him and gave it under the 70 yards and
[24:20] it came to pass that when the spirit
[24:22] rested upon him they prophesied and did
[24:24] not cease
[24:25] now here's here's kind of a quote I'm
[24:27] getting at the bottom
[24:29] and the Samaritan Church a brother
[24:31] around said they call themselves
[24:32] Pentecostal and Full Gospel let them
[24:34] prove it at Pentecost the fire came in a
[24:37] cloud
[24:38] is separated over each of them like a
[24:40] tongue and fell on each one and then he
[24:43] goes to explain it and talk about why
[24:46] where is the fire today and and and
[24:48] things but see it started off that fire
[24:51] came at Pentecost in the cloud to
[24:53] identify that he was there he was coming
[24:55] in his church to give them power
[24:59] and it kept rolling down through seven
[25:01] Church angels
[25:04] and then in Exodus 24 15 Moses what went
[25:08] up into the mount and a cloud covered
[25:10] the mouth
[25:11] and look what happened Cloud covered the
[25:13] mouth for like seven days
[25:15] and God didn't speak and people wonder
[25:18] why how was brother Branham out there
[25:20] when the cloud came when the cloud came
[25:22] and then brother Branham went like eight
[25:24] days later and got the message well the
[25:26] same thing happened back in Texas Moses
[25:28] went up into the mountain the cloud
[25:29] cover the mountain the glory of the Lord
[25:31] Abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud
[25:33] covered at six days and the seventh day
[25:35] he called into Moses out of the mess of
[25:36] the cloud
[25:38] and the sight of the glory of the Lord
[25:39] was like devouring fire on the top of
[25:41] the mountain the eyes of the children of
[25:42] Israel and Moses went into the midst of
[25:45] the cloud and gathered him up into the
[25:47] mountain and Moses went in the mouth 40
[25:48] days and 40 nights so what happened up
[25:50] in their mouth that's when God began to
[25:52] impart to him exactly how to build a
[25:54] tabernacle
[25:56] why why did it build a tabernacle so God
[25:59] come and live in that and make his
[26:01] presence known to the people and that
[26:02] cloud came down and lived inside the
[26:04] Tabernacle now what's God doing now
[26:06] because what we read last week with red
[26:08] Colossians 126 27 that this mystery that
[26:11] was hidden from the Gentiles is now
[26:12] revealed that God's trying to put
[26:14] himself inside of people and tired
[26:15] himself Tabernacle himself inside of our
[26:18] flesh and when he went up in the mount
[26:21] that he came down from the mountain and
[26:23] and he he laid everything in order about
[26:26] exactly how that Tabernacle should be
[26:28] placed now everything should be built
[26:30] and then God gave the Ten Commandments
[26:32] and and uh put that testimony in the Ark
[26:36] of the Covenant and you know they uh
[26:38] through four thousand years they they
[26:40] tried to live the Ten Commandments by by
[26:43] truth they had the truth
[26:45] but you can't
[26:48] to really live the spirit has to come
[26:52] and Quicken The Ten Commandments now
[26:54] those Ten Commandments that they have
[26:56] they can really be written in our hearts
[26:58] and we can be written Epistles known and
[27:00] read of all men and if you keep reading
[27:03] through a few more chapters this that
[27:05] those Ten Commandments remember were
[27:06] written by the Finger of God what writes
[27:09] those Ten Commandments on the tables of
[27:12] your heart as the Finger of God it's not
[27:13] it's not something you could do just
[27:15] like it wasn't something that Moses did
[27:17] if Moses didn't write them if uh it's
[27:20] something that God right and scribes
[27:23] into the table of your heart
[27:25] and what did he do there I will meet
[27:27] with thee what was the whole purpose of
[27:29] Moses coming out from the mountain and
[27:31] getting the Tabernacle ready and getting
[27:33] everything straightened out so that God
[27:34] could communion with his people and I
[27:36] will commune with thee from above the
[27:38] mercy from between the two Charities
[27:40] which are pulling the Ark of the
[27:41] testimony of all things which I'll give
[27:43] the in commandment unto the children of
[27:45] Israel so that God could live with his
[27:47] people and tell him what he wanted to be
[27:49] doing which is what we're talking about
[27:52] uh well I should have just read these
[27:55] live
[27:56] and he gave him to Moses when he had
[27:58] made an end of communing with him under
[27:59] Paul Mount Sinai two tables of testimony
[28:02] tables of stone written with the Finger
[28:04] of God
[28:08] see at the temple brother Brown said he
[28:10] announced this coming with a great cloud
[28:15] what was he redoing here he was
[28:17] revealing himself in another fashion
[28:19] this is from the uncertain Sam what was
[28:21] again a glorified transfigure Condition
[28:23] it's coming the way he's coming a
[28:25] glorified Christ transformed his Arabic
[28:28] Shine Like the Sun he's talking about on
[28:30] the mount Transfiguration they were
[28:31] looking at him it's raining shine like
[28:33] the sun he stood in the cloud and he's
[28:34] Conan The Clouds Of Glory overshadowed
[28:36] by Cloud not a little white Thunderhead
[28:38] up the honor but the cloud that he comes
[28:40] in has a Cloud of Glory all these angels
[28:42] women Hallelujah that's the way he's
[28:44] coming and coming in a Cloud of Glory
[28:46] that nobody will see
[28:48] except for chosen people that understand
[28:51] and can know what God has done it's not
[28:54] going to be a great big show that's what
[28:56] everybody's expecting
[28:59] and I remember uh
[29:01] brother Brown there were there were
[29:04] six people in this church I believe that
[29:07] had different visions and stuff leading
[29:08] up to that Capstone Revelation that said
[29:10] of the the birds the uh uh Eagles and
[29:15] trying to recall from memory but said go
[29:17] go out west and this was the first one
[29:20] was brother Jackson's dream that said uh
[29:22] talked about he said all of us here is
[29:24] the way you put it the brother from
[29:25] George and all around we were all around
[29:26] standing in the lit together listening
[29:28] to you interpret that mysterious riding
[29:30] on the stone on that mountain because
[29:32] Brotherhood came and he like opened up
[29:34] the top of this mountain and uh the sun
[29:36] he talked about the Sun the light has
[29:38] never shine on this before looking on
[29:40] this watch this look upon this light has
[29:43] never come upon it before and and then
[29:45] he's revealing these Hidden Mysteries
[29:47] are in this mountain we talked about the
[29:49] stone that came out of the mountain and
[29:51] all these different quotes that we read
[29:52] before and so God this this Cloud came
[29:55] down to open up this mystery so that we
[29:57] can go in the Rapture and and this is
[29:59] the and I want to kind of identify bring
[30:01] out a very few State and looked on to
[30:04] what I had told them very few will stay
[30:06] and listen and and and really count what
[30:09] brought around God has brought to a
[30:12] prophet as something so precious because
[30:14] it's it's this is what is going to take
[30:16] us into the Rapture is the reveal word
[30:19] of Malachi 4.
[30:29] and I'll stop right there that's what
[30:32] that's why I was doing
[30:35] thank you
[30:46] thank you
