And what what we're going to do is now we're going to call brother Scott out and let him just pour his heart out. &gt;&gt; Preach what the Lord's put on. I don't want him to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the Lord to preach. And I believe he's got a gift that he'll use. &gt;&gt; And I believe our brother's going to give us the words of eternal life tonight &gt;&gt; as we come up to the end of this year. 54 years we've had these watch night services. When this church started in 1971, July the 4th, that year we had a watch night service. And from that year till now, 54 years, the church will be here 55 years if the Lord carries this coming July. And uh brother Ernest Moat was a p our first pastor which is uh Joyce's Charlotte's dad. And u then my dad was a pastor here for about 45 years until the Lord took him home. And uh and God give me grace with the people to uh to continue on uh preaching for the for the people here. So we love you with the love of the Lord and we thank you for all that you give us. Thanks for the food downstairs. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to have Brother Scott come out, preach as long as he wants to, and then we'll take like a 10-minute break. Run downstairs, don't sit and eat, but go downstairs, go to the bathroom, get you a little drink or something, and come back up here. And then we'll start and we'll have all specials. And if you have a testimony on your heart, we'll have plenty of time for testimonies. Right about midnight or somewhere there close to it, we will take communion. No footwashing, but we'll take communion right at midnight. While the world's doing their thing, we're going to do our thing. And we've been doing this thing for 54 years. And the Lord has really blessed us. And uh he's given us another year. And uh as brother Boyd was saying, you know, look, reflect back on what this past year's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The new year's coming up. Let's live closer to God than we've ever lived before. &gt;&gt; Make that your New Year's resolutions is to live closer to the Lord than you've ever lived before. Because you know what? It's closer to his coming than ever before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No doubt. Look at what's going on in the in in the land. Look at what's going on in the world. &gt;&gt; We're going to see some things in 2026, I believe, that we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it'll be prophecy and it'll be fulfilled. And we listen, we've already read the newspaper. &gt;&gt; We don't need to go on the internet, find out what's going to happen next. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We've already been told what's going to happen. We know what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us what was going to happen years and years ago. So, we're just living in it now. living the prophecy, becoming the word of God, and then we're gonna get out of here, and then we won't have to do this anymore. We'll have a we'll have a uh a watch night service every day &gt;&gt; cuz it won't be no end. Everything will be just perfect. &gt;&gt; So, let's sing word of God over every two as our brother comes. Like I said, get your specials ready afterwards. Um brother Aaron will be leading uh taking over after that. And then if you have something, we would love for you to sing, testify, whatever you want to do, whatever the Lord leads you to do. That's what we want you to do tonight. Tonight, we've got 4 hours, three and a half now, but four hours to take over. And this this building has been dedicated to the to the L to the Lord. And now we brought Lord's people in here. So now you brought your liquifier. Let's turn it on and let's listen to what our brother has to say. Let's sing word of God ever true. Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words of life, words of hope. gives us strength. Think about that. Helps us cold in this world. Wherever we roll, the word of God will guide us home. Word of God, it's ever true, changing me, changing you. And we have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Holy word of mouth came through sacrifice. Oh, he the faithful words of Christ. Holy word, long preserve for our walk in this world. We resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart.

Is that our desire this evening? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what we've come for, God. Just to speak to our hearts. And it's just an honor to be here. Amen. Just good to be here. and uh Brother Wade, we've known him for some time and uh we finally we've been coming for years honestly and and uh we've we're finally here and uh we uh saw a Dollar General back down the road and we felt right at home. We've got them about every 10 ft where we're at. Uh, we felt right at home till then we passed a Dollar General market and then I said, "They're a little more upscale here than we are." We we hadn't we hadn't got that far yet, but uh uh maybe it's coming. Uh praise the Lord. So, just an honor to be here. Good to see you. There's some familiar faces. Brother Aaron Roberts there has blessed our church several times and just was there not long ago. So, it's always good to see him. He he you already know this, I believe, but he's he's a tarill at heart &gt;&gt; and or a tarill at birth and uh uh so uh we've got claims on him in North Carolina and uh but we we love him and his family and just uh praise the Lord. It's just going to be wonderful to to uh to go into the new year with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we can say we were here in 25 and 26. Brother Way, praise the Lord. Let's take our Bibles out and uh he told me not to look at any clocks tonight. So, um, we'll try to to honor pastor's wishes, um, this evening, but let's go to a real familiar portion of scripture. Luke the 17th chapter. Luke the 17th chapter. Maybe we'll just start about verse 30 this evening. Luke 17 and 30. Luke 17 is certainly a identifying um chapter &gt;&gt; uh for our day and and uh we're no strangers to it. So Luke chap 17 and verse 30. Maybe we just bow our heads as we begin here this evening. Father, we thank you Lord for just uh God allowing us to be here this evening, Lord. And Father, just bringing each one, oh God, to come to the house of God. No greater place tonight that we could be. and Lord, a place that we could come and Lord bring in the the new year, Lord, as Lord, as believers tonight. And Father, we just ask now that you'd Lord, come move me aside. And Father, that you would speak to our hearts tonight, Lord. God, I pray that you'd minister to the needs. Lord, you you know each one of us. You know what we have need of, Lord, maybe some that's not present, but Lord, that are streaming or Lord will hear it. I pray God that it'll extend Lord to them Lord and just reach Lord uh wherever one might be tonight God have your way. We look to you Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. Amen. Luke 17 and verse 30. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away. And he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding together. The one shall be taken, the other left. Brother Bram tells us this is the rapture, right? Verse 36, two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken and the other left. And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? Not when &gt;&gt; that already been established. &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Lot, &gt;&gt; when you see the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; the when had already been established, they didn't ask when. &gt;&gt; Where where is this going to take place? &gt;&gt; Profound question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he gives them a profound answer. And they answered and said unto him, "Where, Lord?" And he said unto them, "Wheroever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together." &gt;&gt; I want to take for a thought tonight if I could. Rapture landscape. &gt;&gt; Rapture landscape. You may take your seat tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to have my wife with us and my daughter TR and also couple of the saints from the church, Sister Dawn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Elizabeth, take take it down. Thank you. Amen. I I want to look at this this evening if we can just uh by the help of the Lord. And and uh you know quite a quite a passage of scripture. And you know here the the disciples would ask the question and it again it had already been uh established uh God had uh the Lord had told them that uh uh the the win. Amen. that you look for these certain things when you know as it was in the days of Lot and and and as it was in the days of Noah and there would be it would be a time that it would be very characteristics of those times and and how Amen. We realize that and we realize though that that the the time is is just part of it because there's a lot of people a lot of good Baptists can can identify with uh with that and they could tell you that hey we're in the days of Lot. Amen. They could tell you we're in the days of of Noah and and and they could tell you what time it is. Amen. But that's only a portion of it. That's only a piece of it. Amen. Uh the other part is where is it going to be? Can you say amen? Amen. And I want to I want to be where it's at. Amen. Because listen, you can know what time something is but not know where it is and you can miss it. Amen. But if you know where it is, it really don't matter when what the time is because you'll be where it happens. Can somebody say amen? Can I say that again? Amen. You You can know Amen. the time of something but not where it's at and you can miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you know where it's at, whenever it happens, amen, you're there. How many can say, "I want to be there." Amen. I'm going to be in that. Amen. And and and regardless, and we thank God that Amen. that we are aware of the time and and and that that God has has made it very clear in in this age, amen, the uh the the time and Amen. But the but where it's going to happen. Amen. And Jesus would tell us that it would be where the uh uh where the the body is. The eagles would be gathered there. Amen. In other words, amen. It's in the revealed word. Uh the the the the meeting place, the the rapture, Amen, is in the revealed word. Amen. That's where it's going to be. Amen. And and brother Brandon was asked a question, you know, do we have to be at a certain place? And he would say, "No, you know, it's it's not so much a geographical location as it is a spiritual location." Amen. Wherever we are tonight, wherever we're from, Amen. The meeting place, Amen. The place to be is the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this if we can, the rapture landscape, and just look at just for just &gt;&gt; He said, "Not a few minutes." He wants me for a little while. Uh I I want to look at at what it what it looks like. Amen. Because how many is familiar with what a landscape is? And and you know certain places have uh here in Georgia there's a certain landscape and and you know I was thinking years ago we we went to Florida for the first time and and we took the kids. They were uh some of them were small and and uh we were on our way to Florida and we made it a few hours. I don't even know if we'd got out of South Carolina. And we stopped and and uh one of the kids said, "Uh, are we here?" Uh, you see, they'd never been there. And they they really didn't know what to be looking for. And and so they said, "Are we there?" For for a minute there, I thought, "Boy, if I told them, yeah, I could save a whole lot of money." If I wouldn't do that, but I thought if I if I just for a minute, I thought, Lord, if I just Yeah. If I said, "We're we've made it. This this could be a we save us half of what we'd be spending." But uh you know, they had never been there. Amen. But now they've been there. Uh they've been to Florida and they can tell you what the landscape is. They can tell you what to look for. They can tell you when we're getting near it. And and if I could say it this way, amen, as believers, amen, that has that have truly amen have tasted amen and experienced, Amen. the word of God in this hour. Amen. And and understand, Amen, that God has done something special in this day. Amen. They can't accept nothing else. A I said they can't accept anything else. You'd never fool them. Amen. That we're there. Amen. With something less. &gt;&gt; You would never trick them &gt;&gt; into believing that that that we're in the rapture with a message from yesterday. You would you would never convince a real message believer, Amen, with a Pentecostal message that we're in the rapture. Amen. Because they've experienced those things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they I want to look just just at a few things this evening and and just at at what that looks like and and what it don't look like. Uh are you with me? Uh we we'll see where he's not rapturing from. We we know he's not rapturing from a denomination. &gt;&gt; Right? He's not rapturing from an organization spoken or unspoken. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He's not rapturing from a little circle. &gt;&gt; Come on. Or some trendy movement. Amen. Around the message even. Amen. He's he's he's rapturing from the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's where it's coming from. Amen. To tonight. And so, amen. When you look at this and you you realize that that God, Amen, has brought us up to a certain place in this day that he would never Amen. He would never rapture the church just under justification. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He would never rapture the church just under sanctification. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. We got a lot of people that, you know, they they they'll they'll get to a certain place, maybe sanctification and and and they just get, you know, hunker down and and and and everything is just, you know, in sanctification. But and we thank God for that. But listen, if that was it, they would have been raptured back in Wesley's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. If just justification was it, we would have been raptured, Amen. back in Luther's day. Amen. But he wouldn't rapture. That would not be, Amen. the final place. Amen. Justification would not be that place. Sanctification would not be that place. And we found out that the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Amen, would not be that place. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That that God will would continue to bring us further. If if just the baptism of the Holy Ghost would have been that place, we' had a rapture a long time ago. &gt;&gt; They would have raptured under Pentecost. &gt;&gt; They would have raptured under another age. Amen. And if I if if that would have been it, &gt;&gt; they they would they would have gone then. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he would bring us on up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said he would bring us on to a bride age. &gt;&gt; Come on. What's he doing? He's getting the the the the bride ready for a rapture. Amen. That he's bringing us to the place where it actually takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he he would he would bring us beyond just the just the baptism or a restoration of gifts. We thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Uh but but there would be another turn. &gt;&gt; There would be another turn. There had to be a turning of the hearts. &gt;&gt; Think about that. You had justification. &gt;&gt; You had sanctification. &gt;&gt; You had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But then we had to have Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; and Elijah because there was another turn. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a turning of the heart. So you could you could have all of those &gt;&gt; and there was still a portion of the heart &gt;&gt; that had to be turned. &gt;&gt; No, not notice the order. It was not justification, sanctification, the turn of the heart, then the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But it was justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and then there still had to be a turning of the heart. So after all of that, the heart could still be &gt;&gt; the heart could STILL BE, AMEN. NOT turned the right way. &gt;&gt; And and and as far as this goes, it wasn't turned the right way. Amen. It would take a it would take a ministry to Amen. a a prophet and a a message in this day to uh to to turn that heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. to to take us. Amen. Father, Amen. to to the to the real place that this would that this was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many say it'd be all right if it happened in 20 I was going to say 2026, but 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I I don't know a more imminent uh uh uh message than than than the rapture of the bride. Amen. I don't know anything that's more more pressing or anything that we should be more aware of right now than our leaving here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham said he interprets modern events. He said he interprets his own word &gt;&gt; by vindicated and in the age that it's purposed for. He said the age that it's given for. He said we're not living in a Pentecostal age. We're living in another age. We're not living in the Methodist age. We're living in another age. We're living on up here. Amen. On up here. Amen. See this this rapture, it's a it's an ascending life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's not a roller coaster. &gt;&gt; It It's not a leoty roller coaster. The rapture is an ascending life. Amen.

TO COME UP a little higher. AMEN. THERE'S ROOM NO MATTER WHERE WE'RE AT tonight to come up a little higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm reminded of Isaiah the prophet in in in the first five or six chapters, five chapters, I believe it is. He's he's a prophet &gt;&gt; and he's prophesying &gt;&gt; and he's he's declaring the word of the Lord and he's he's delivering all the woes to Israel. But in about come along about that sixth chapter. Amen. He has a a a transforming vision and he sees the Lord like he's never seen him before. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. already a prophet, &gt;&gt; already declaring the word of the Lord, already uh uh uh uh ordered of God in what he was doing. Amen. But in that sixth chapter, amen, he saw God high and lifted up. Amen. God, Amen, allowed him to see him like he had never. In other words, there was room, Amen, for him to come up a little higher. Amen. And when he did that, it was no longer the woes of Israel, but it was woe is me. Oh, woe is me, Lord. Amen. It caused him to see himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he realized that, oh, we can we can come up. So, can I say this? From the from the front door to the back door, wherever we are. Amen. There's room to come on up a little higher tonight. Amen. Until you get a body change. Amen. There's room. And this is an ascending rapture. This is an ascending life. Amen. And the call is on us. Amen. The prophecy is over us to come up hither. Amen. To come up a little higher. Amen. Wherever we are, God help us to come up a little higher tonight. &gt;&gt; It's it's heavenly places. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he has raised us up. Ephesians 2. He hath raised us up together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Together. How many like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, so he's seated us. He's positioned us. It it's it's a place, listen, when he se when he seated us there, he's he's positioned us there. Amen. And and it's it's something we we get accustomed to. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I said it's something we get accustomed to. Amen. When when we're seated there, he's saying this is the place, Amen, that we're to dwell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh not coming down. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. But coming up &gt;&gt; seated. Amen. Established a place that he's established for us. Amen. That that we we not be up and down. &gt;&gt; That we not be in and out. &gt;&gt; See, can I tell you where he's not? He's not rapturing tonight from the barroom. &gt;&gt; He might deliver you from the barroom, &gt;&gt; but he's not rapturing you from the barroom. &gt;&gt; He He He may bring you from the barroom. He He may bring you from the uh uh uh the worldly whatever, but he doesn't rapture from there. Amen. He'll deliver you from there. Amen. If you're here tonight and Amen. and you're there, he'll deliver you from there. Amen. But don't ever think we're going to go from just the world to a rapture. Amen. He brings us up and he brings us up AND HE LIFTS US UP. Can you say amen? AND HE BRINGS US UP HIGHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. To those to those places. Amen. John, brother Brandham said, was summoned to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you've got, you say, well, how did I get there? But you were summoned. &gt;&gt; God summonsed you. He put a summons on your on your life. Amen. You You might have You might have had something else planned. Amen. But there was something bigger than that. Amen. God summonsed your life. God has called you. Amen. And he's brought you not just called you, but he summons you to come up higher. &gt;&gt; He summons you to come up. Amen. Where he can so Amen. acclimate you to to to the spiritual things. Are you with me? So he's raised us up. raise us up together. &gt;&gt; Matthew 18, I was looking at this the other day. Matthew 18 and 20. For where two or three are gathered together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice that where two or three are gathered together &gt;&gt; in my name, there am I in the midst to them. Right &gt;&gt; now, two or three are gathered. Not just gathered, &gt;&gt; but gathered together, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, you can have a gathering and not be together. You ever been to a family reunion? &gt;&gt; You're you're all gathered, but you're not together. You got a lot of ideas. You you got a you got a lot of dysfunctional things and people and and ideas and and you almost dread going to those things, but but you go this time of year. You go and and and you see Aunt Martha and and sister so and so and cousin so and so and and and and you're gathered and they can be a hundred of you, but you're not gathered together. &gt;&gt; So, it's more than just a gathering. It's more see you can be you can be gathered at many places and not be together. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Many pl you you can come to church and be gathered but not be together. &gt;&gt; You you can come and one have one idea and another have another idea and I just tell people keep your ideas to yourself. Just keep them ideas to you. It'll make it a whole lot easier. AMEN. WE WE GOT ENOUGH of them already. just just just keep them just keep them ideas to to uh to yourself. But you can be gathered. AMEN. BUT BUT LISTEN, that's not where it's at. It's when we're gathered together &gt;&gt; and we're together truly in one mind &gt;&gt; and one purpose under one message. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So where where where we're gathered together in my name &gt;&gt; cuz you can be gathered together &gt;&gt; under something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be gathered together like you can be gathered together in a ball game. &gt;&gt; All be gathered and be together on who we're pulling for. You can come on. &gt;&gt; Uh you can be gathered together and but but it goes on further than that. But it's it's when we're gathered together under that name &gt;&gt; in his name, &gt;&gt; not in some name of a meeting or a name of a personality or but when we're gathered together, amen, in that name, he promises I'll be in that meeting. Amen. So if we're gathered tonight, two or three of us and a whole lot more than that here, and we're gathered and we really come, Amen. really come to hear and to meet from him, we've got a promise. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I didn't come for any other reason. &gt;&gt; So he says when we gather that way, he says, I'm in the midst of them. Now you see why it only takes two or three &gt;&gt; cuz there's a lot of people gathering for a whole lot of other reasons. But I I just want to go ahead and put it out there. Amen. For them that's gathered for any other reason, it only takes two or three of us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Amen. He would bring us. He would He would He would He would raise us up. It's a high calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; It's heavenly places. &gt;&gt; We're talking about where the rapture. We're talking where we're raptured from. &gt;&gt; We're not raptured from the lowly places. We're raptured from the heavenly places. We're raptur It's a high calling. It's a high calling of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he would seat us there. Amen. He would positionally place us there. Amen. And we would we would get not uh not satisfied from a uh just a you know almost a a carnal uh point of view but but we would get very accustom &gt;&gt; very acclimated. &gt;&gt; Can you can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. There there's a there's a term called alclimatization &gt;&gt; and and and you you maybe you've you know seen seen maybe like Denver, Colorado. Uh it's a mile high &gt;&gt; uh you know above sea level and and you can go to you can go to that Denver and it's a mile high. It's a higher it's a higher climate. And when you go there, amen, maybe from Georgia, and you go there, you get there, you know what? You do a lot of walking or a lot of running, you're going to have a problem breathing. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you're in a higher atmosphere. You're in a higher higher climate. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's a process called aclimatization. that if you stay there long enough, &gt;&gt; if you stay there long enough that your body physically, your body physically will begin to adapt to that environment. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and if you stay there long enough, Amen. Runners go there, athletes go there and train and and so forth. If you stay there long enough, your body actually acclimates to that. Amen. And then when maybe you were wore out a week before, but now you're there and your body is starting to adapt to that higher elevation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now what was winding you ain't winding you no more. What's happening? You're getting used to being up there. Amen. Your body's getting used to it. It's the same way spiritually. Amen. When we come together, Amen. when God, amen, lifts us up and raises us up into those places. DON'T TOGGLE BACK AND FORTH. AMEN. JUST KEEP COMING. AMEN. JUST KEEP COMING to the services. Just keep listening to the tapes. Just keep just keep saying amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENS IS, AMEN. AFTER SO LONG, AMEN. SPIRITUALLY YOU START TO ACCLIMATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SPIRITUALLY, you start getting used to to to higher elevation. &gt;&gt; Higher living. &gt;&gt; Come on. I've seen people come in, tithe for two weeks, and say, "This ain't working." &gt;&gt; So, you've robbed God for 30 years, and you're going to tithe for two weeks, and think this just this is just going to kick in. uh say just keep doing it. &gt;&gt; You say Lord just keep doing it.

We said Luke 17, it's an it's it's identifies our our day and &gt;&gt; our message. And brother Brandham says this is an identifying age. He says that in identification. He says this is an identifying age. Amen. Everything's being identified &gt;&gt; in this agemen. &gt;&gt; Uh there's there's nothing amen that that that that has not been identified in this age. &gt;&gt; It's it's the age now of real identification. &gt;&gt; How many's heard real ID? &gt;&gt; It's it's it's you know I always thought my ID was my ID. I was somewhere and they said, "Well, we need your real ID." I said, "Well, this ain't a fake one. This is really me. &gt;&gt; This isn't the guy behind me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is me. But they don't see they want they want to really validate this thing. Uh uh uh before before going abroad. Uh they they want to they want to know it's the it's the day of real ID. Amen. I'm going to tell you before we're going to go abroad, before we're going to leave here. Amen. We're going to really be identified who we really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what we're really called for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And that that we are part of that rapture. Amen. And we've been identified by a word in this hour. Amen. That we are part of that. &gt;&gt; It's that hour. It's the hour. Amen. Of identification. &gt;&gt; So much focus on on real ID. The the reason being is because there's so much false ID. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There there's so much false identity. Amen. that my son, he was a state trooper for a little while and he p pulled a pulled a man one night way in the wee hours of the morning. It's about 2:00 in the morning up in the mountains and he said it was all the whole thing was suspicious. He said, "But daddy said this guy had uh eight different IDs, not eight forms of identification, eight different identifications." And he said, he said, "And the one he the one he gave me wasn't him." So, so, so he said, he said he, you know, he he found out this after the fact. He said, you know, obviously the guy was running from something. &gt;&gt; Uh, he he he didn't want to be identified with who he really is. &gt;&gt; Amen. for for whatever reason something had happened and and and you know what whatever he had done he didn't want to be associated with who he really really is. &gt;&gt; A can you say amen? Amen. And some of us listen maybe maybe this age has has put a a label on us and put another ID but this is the hour. This is the age amen where God is bringing our real identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bringing a real identity. prophet come an identifying prophet. Amen. In this hour and he's identified, Amen. He's identified everything. He He identified the false church. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It was he he identified who that mother harlot was. &gt;&gt; He identified the the the the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God bless Clarence Larkin's heart. &gt;&gt; Sure. Absolutely. We we appreciate he was he was ahead of his time. &gt;&gt; He had a lot of revelation, but he wasn't a prophet. Amen. A prophet didn't stop with just identifying seven gentile ages, but he identified seven angel messengers &gt;&gt; to those seven. You say, "Why?" It's an identifying age. He was an identifying angel. Are you with me? It's an identifying time. Amen. Brother Brandham said, "And greater than Solomon is here." He said, "The scripture never leaves any age without a clear-cut identification that we might know what hour we're living in." Amen. It's made it very clear. Can somebody say amen? Amen. What hour we're in, it's been identified. Amen. He goes on in another place trying to do God a service. He said, "How did he bring Christ here?" He said, "By the word of the prophets." &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said, "How will he bring his bride here?" &gt;&gt; "By the word of the prophets." &gt;&gt; How? Watch this. How did he identify him when he come? &gt;&gt; He said, "By a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him, come out of the wilderness." So he's saying when Jesus come, how did how did he how did God identify him? &gt;&gt; By a man with the spirit of Elijah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "How will he identify his bride, &gt;&gt; the same way &gt;&gt; he promised in Malachi 4 the same thing?" Amen. In other words, amen. When Jesus was here, amen, he identified him by Elijah the prophet. Amen. And then when the bride of Christ come, Amen. In this day, how was she identified? Amen. by an Elijah the prophet in this day. Amen. As he is, so is she. &gt;&gt; He would identify us by Elijah the prophet just like he was identified. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a that's an identifying time. This is an identifying age. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He He has identified not a church &gt;&gt; but a bride. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's no longer the church, right? The the church is no longer descriptive of just the pure elect. It It takes everything in. Amen. So he would take us, Amen. From the church, Amen. to the bride, to the elect, to the wife. Can somebody say amen? Not the spirit and the church say come. The spirit and the bride say come. Amen. Not the church hath made HERSELF READY. THE WIFE HATH MADE HERSELF READY. CAN YOU say amen? He's pulled us on a little further. &gt;&gt; It's because you've got rapture. You're part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an identifying age. &gt;&gt; Israel got her identity back in this age. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It was lost for years. Israel's Israel's identity was lost for years. Thousands of years. They would go into captivity. You know the history of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. They would go into captivity and Babylonian and Roman and Amen. uh you know just just a uh uh was awful. They would sin and and and raise up false gods and idolatry and and and it would bring them into captivity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and but thank God &gt;&gt; thank God in the in the age of of true identity. Amen. God Amen. would bring her back. Amen. And and that star of David flies tonight. Amen. Amen. For for almost 2,000 years, Israel's identity was lost. In 1948, they become a nation again. &gt;&gt; In this age, are you with me? &gt;&gt; In this age, they got their identity back. It was covered over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Different different names. Most uh most recent Palestine. &gt;&gt; It was under different name. It didn't even carry the name Israel. &gt;&gt; It had so many layers. if you will. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Uh false identities over it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, matter of fact, never before in the in the history of the world has a people lost their their their statethood and become a nation after such an extended period of time &gt;&gt; as Israel after all of those years. And God would bring them back &gt;&gt; and and and and begin to uh to to uncover. Amen. and and to pull back those false identities. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and bring them back to Amen. to to who they really are. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see this even in the you know when I've been to Israel, maybe some of you have and and I didn't realize I didn't realize a lot till I got brother Bam said the Bible become a new book. Uh don't worry if you've never been. He said when the seals were opened it become a new book too. So uh you got a new book either way and I would take that one over a trip to Israel. Amen. But uh but you know he he talks about it and you know how or when we were over there and we we we learned something and that was how that uh Israel for years when you know when when they would build something they maybe tear down something or something was destroyed due to the due to the space and everything they would just build on top of it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. That's why you see all these archaeologists, these digs from time, they'll dig down, they'll find something biblical. And you'll think, well, how didn't they have it before? Because they've built over top of that and they've built over top of that and and and and just just I layer after layer after layer. And so so as as as God in this age has allowed through technology and the archaeology, Amen. they would begin to unearth &gt;&gt; her true identity &gt;&gt; layer after layer. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing it, Amen. back to Amen. to to what's really there. And then we hear well this was this was King David's or this was Solomon's or what's h that identity has been brought back. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And they pull back those layers. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; How many listen what he does what he does to them. Listen he how many can thank God that he's pulled some layers back off of your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. You had some false identities. Amen. You had some false labels on your life. Amen. But one, I'm thinking of the woman at the well. Amen. She was covered over with a with a with a handful of them. Amen. Until she met the one, Amen. that could bring her her true identity. And Jesus stood there and layer after layer. &gt;&gt; Them husbands were identities. &gt;&gt; He began to unear, come on. Amen. pull back layer after layer, identity after identity, till he found who she really was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You've had five identities, and the one you're walking with now is not your real one." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You've had five. And the one, what was he do? He pulled all of those back. Oh, thank God. And he revealed to her who she really was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, when that identity was restored, she got her voice back. &gt;&gt; I said she got her voice back. &gt;&gt; Listen, for years, for she had to go to that well alone. &gt;&gt; She had no influence. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said nobody would listen to her. &gt;&gt; He said those men would have never listened to her. &gt;&gt; Come on. You can hear him talk about this. &gt;&gt; Amen. That she would go alone. Amen. Had no influence. Had no voice. Amen. But when she got her identity back, &gt;&gt; she got her voice back. Amen. Because she left there. Amen. Under her new identity. Amen. And went back down into the town. Amen. And what? Because of her word. Amen. A word that they wouldn't EVEN HEAR. AMEN. AN hour before this. Amen. But when she got OH MY. AMEN. I'M thinking of a bride getting her true identity. Amen. And with HER TRUE IDENTITY. AMEN. WE GOT A VOICE TONIGHT. AMEN. AND WE ARE THAT FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. AMEN. UNDER OUR RIGHT IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; Under our true identity. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE NO VOICE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; Got nothing to say. &gt;&gt; Just hush. Come on. Nothing. A. Amen. But listen. Under Amen. Under the truth. Amen. Under this word. Amen. Under our true identity. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; We got a lot to say. Brother Brham said, "You try to shut her up now." &gt;&gt; He said before, he said they wouldn't have heard a word she had to say. &gt;&gt; But now, &gt;&gt; now she's got her identity back. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; She's got her identity back. She's got her voice back. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. People, listen. When you make your calling in election, &gt;&gt; sure, &gt;&gt; that's it. God will cause people to hear you. &gt;&gt; I said when you make your calling election sure, &gt;&gt; when you when you make your election sure and who you really are, God will cause people to hear you. &gt;&gt; It may be somebody that wouldn't listen to you for 10 seconds before. But when you come to who you really are, God will cause people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're talking about a We're talking about what it looks like. &gt;&gt; I want you to look around that this evening at your at your spiritual landscape. What's it look like? &gt;&gt; What's it look like? &gt;&gt; Does it look like Georgia's or it look like Florida? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Look like Leota Sea or does it look like rapture? &gt;&gt; See, because the question was where where is this going to be? Where do I need to go? &gt;&gt; The revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revealed word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold us, will it? &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold us. Amen. All right. How many's thankful for a true identity? &gt;&gt; Amen. That that God would would so identify you. Amen. I see I come I come out of Pentecost. I was I was raised in the assembly of God for about 16 years. And I had a mom, a praying mom, a mom that believed. My dad was an unbeliever. My mom my mom believed as far as she could believe the time and and so we were we were raised that way and and uh for about 16 years when I got 16 I wasn't I had never given my heart to the Lord and I knew God. I knew about you know knew about God and had that upbringing but you know my heart wasn't in the right place. So when I got 16 I told I was working at McDonald's. Uh that's why I don't cook anymore now. I did all my cooking between the wife says, "You don't ever cook anything." I said, "I cooked enough cheeseburgers from time I was 16 to 18 if I never cook another and I'm okay." I said, "I've cooked thousands upon thousands upon thousands of cheeseburgers. &gt;&gt; I still like to eat them. But I ain't much of a cook. I make a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich and cheese toast. But but I told the boss, I said, "I want you to work me." I said, "I I want to I want to work uh Sundays. Work me Wednesdays." And uh and so he obliged. He he he I worked me every Sunday. And so, of course, I drifted further away. And it was about it was about four or five years before uh God dealt with me. Amen. And so anyway, the the Lord had dealt with me and all I knew was the Pentecostal background. And and so after I surrendered my life to the Lord, I took a I belineed to the Pentecostal church. And you know, I got in there and it was okay for the first six or eight months. and and then I just kept reading and kept, you know, kept just praying and looking at things and then then I was approached by by a brother and uh he shared a couple things with me and I just couldn't get away. I come to come to work one day and I told him he said, "What'd you do this weekend?" I said, "I was baptized." And uh I said, "I was baptized on Sunday." And he said, "You was baptized?" He said, "Well, how was you baptized?" I said, "What do you mean how was I baptized?" baptized in water in a river if you want to get specific. And he said, "No, how was you baptized?" I said, "I don't know what you're talking about. You know, water, river, uh, I'm feeling great." He said, "No, what did you how did you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus?" And he said, "What did he say?" I said, he said, he said I said, "Well," he said, "He baptized you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." He said, "Oh, you got baptized into the Catholic Church." &gt;&gt; And I said, "What?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You got baptized into the Catholic Church." I I took offense cuz man, I I was God knows my heart, right? And and and I was doing all I knew how to do, but I he said it and and I I boy, it burnt me up on the inside, you know? I walked away from that car. I couldn't get it off my mind. I baptized the Catholic church. So a little bit later, he came over and he said, ' Yeah. He said, 'You wasn't baptized.' He said, 'You wasted your time. He said, 'You just wasted your time.' I said, what or what are you talking about? And he began to tell me, oh, you know, Christian baptism.

But I had it so bad God took that. I have never in 30 years I've never said another curse word. By God's grace and by GOD'S POWER, THAT'S HOW MUCH GOD will do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He's He's He's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll find you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll find you. So he said, "How did how did what brought Christ here?" He said, "The word of the prophets." &gt;&gt; And he said, "How will he bring his bride here? By the word of the prophets." How did he how did he identify him when he come? He said, "By a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him." &gt;&gt; Come out of the wilderness.

I don't ever like to see it no more than anybody else does. &gt;&gt; But if I've learned one thing is his grace is a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; His grace is a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; God's word calls for total separation. &gt;&gt; Can you stay with me just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; It's a total separation. We're not We're not to go back into the world no more. or have anything to do with the world, &gt;&gt; but cleave only unto God. Jesus is coming after a bride, a woman. See, a church that's separated from the things of the world or cares of the world. She's separated from the fashions of this modern age that we live in. She's separated from the the cares and the traditions of churches. She's separated only to God. And God is the word. And as husband and wife is one, so does the bride and the word become one. For the word is living through the bride. &gt;&gt; That's how that's her credentials. That's her identification. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What an age.

Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And a false identity won't get us there. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be brought back. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be brought back. &gt;&gt; I I was talking to brother Aaron back there. He said he shared it before, but I'll I'll share a little story in closing. I I'm a I'm by vocational. I'm a pastor and I I work I'm an insurance agent and uh been doing it for years. years. I've kind of pulled back some now, but still doing it some. But a number of years ago, I don't know about 10 years ago, I guess. Way time gets by, I had a client that uh real good, real just a great client, and uh a husband and wife. And they uh they were just real fine people, wealthy people. And the husband, his name was Jim. Jim was actually terminally ill and he was he was going to be they told him he only had a short period of time to live. And he had taken she had had a lot of jewelry. We had insured from time to time, but he had taken several pieces of of of jewelry, and he had had a went to a a jewelry store, a jeweler, and he had a ring made, a ring, and I can't remember if it was a a birthday or an anniversary. I'd have to go back and check, but anyway, he he had given her this this ring. And uh it meant a lot to her. She called and said, "I need to I need to insure this." and and we went through the you know what everything we had to do. It was a very high-end piece of jewelry uh high-end ring and so we had to have an appraiser uh an appraisal and we had to have pictures and so forth and then we put a stated amount on it and uh we added it to her insurance. It was a high real high dollar item. highest highest piece of jewelry I'd ever insured. And and uh anyway, so we insured and everything's fine. And and it wasn't long at all after that. I can't remember how how what the time frame was, but I got a call one day. Um her husband had actually passed on at this time, but she called and you could hear a voice breaking up and she said, "I've Scott, I've got a problem." She said, "My ring's gone." And uh and I said, "Oh no." You know, she said, "I have no idea where it's at." She said, "We've looked everywhere. We've we've searched the house. We've She said, "I've I've called my daughter up and uh my best friend and said, "We've swept the house. We've looked everywhere." She said, "It's gone. I've been looking for several days. I don't know what else to do but uh file a claim." Um and she said, "I'm I'm heartbroken because obviously the sentimental value was a whole lot more than to die." She didn't need money. Um but uh this just the sentimental value was worth a whole lot more. And so um I said, "Well, I understand. We'll file it." So we we proceeded to file a claim and a few days later an adjuster and an investigative adjuster because the dollar amount was so high called and said, "We're just kind of, you know, vetting things and we want to know what you know what you know about this client." And uh I said, "Well, she's telling you the truth." I said, "If it's m, she's saying it's missing, it's missing." I said, "They're very I" I said, "If you run any kind of background on them, you'll you'll know." They're just great great people. And I said, um, I said, "If she's saying it's missing, it's missing." I said, "As far as I'm concerned, you're just going to have to pay the claim." And and uh I said, "We've had them for x amount of years." We told them how long they had been insured with us and and and so forth. And and so he said, "Okay." And so they had ended up cutting a check, right? Writing a check and sending it for the for this this ring. Well, a little just a little time went by and I get another phone call and it's her. It's it's it's u uh the price. It's uh her her last name is Price and Gail. And uh so I said, "Gail." And she this time you could hear the the joy in her voice. And she said, 'Oh, she said, 'You you're you're just you're not going to believe it.' And I said, uh, try me. I actually told her that when she called the first time, said, 'You're not going to believe it. I said, 'Try me. Uh, I've I've seen about everything and heard it. So, she calls again. She said, "You're not going to believe this." I said, "Well, try me." And, uh, she said, "You are just not going to believe it." And I said, "Okay, tell me." She said, "Uh, oh, you're just not going to believe it." And and she said, "But I'm going to tell you." And I said, "Okay, tell me." And so she said, she said, "I got my ring." And I said, "You got your ring?" She said, "I've got my ring." And uh so I she said, "Let me tell you how this goes." So when when it was when the ring was was stolen, when when she when it was taken from her house, that's where it was at. The last place she had it was her house. and she had part of the uh part of the underwriting to be able to ride it. She had to have a um a safe in her in her house and she did. She had a safe and uh that was part of it to qualify for this this amount. But this this particular day she had worn the ring and she had come home and she had gone in her bedroom and she slipped it off and the last thing she remembered she laid it on top of a little small jewelry box and said I'm going to put it in the safe later tonight but when she was busy doing something she said that's the last thing I remember I put it on top of that jewelry box and then of course the claim was filed and now she's calling me back and she said, "You're not going to believe it." And and I'd ask her at that time, "Was anybody in your house? Did Did you have did you have visitors? Did you have No, no, no, no, no. You know, the only thing she said, I had some contractors outside." She said, "They were working on the uh the outside doing some landscaping." And she said, you know, she said, uh there was some electrical that needed to be done. and they subbed out the electrical and said, "Uh, an electrician came and I had to let him in the house and take him to LA to the panel and he turned it off, went out and did something and he come right back in and turned it on." He wasn't in the house just a few seconds and he and she said, "My bedroom 4,000 square foot onelevel house." She said, "My bedroom is all the way on the other end of the house from where the panel box was." So said there was nothing to that, but here's how you don't have to give the devil but a second. Right. So, so what happened was that electrician actually come in and saw just a quick opportunity and he shot had no hit the gold mine. had no idea what would been in her bedroom, but went to the bedroom and Brother Wade walked in and found that big huge rock on top of that jewelry box and grabbed it and out he went and he kept it for several days and he knew he had something and he so he was going to go try to he was going to try to sell it and pawn it and so he took it and out of all the places out of all the places that he could have taken that ring, the pawn shops, the jewelry stores. Come on, &gt;&gt; of all the places, he goes to this one particular jewelry store and he goes in and he tells the the the jeweler, he says, "I've got a ring." He said, "I bought for my wife some time ago." Said, "We fallen on hard times." and said, "You know, I'd like to get uh just $4 or $5,000 out of this ring if I could." And he said, "Would you look at it?" So, the man took it and he looked at it. He said, "Well, let me go in the back here and and and and do some uh, you know, just some uh in-depth looking at it." So he took the ring back to the back room and he immediately when he when when the man gave him the ring and he looked it he said that ring looks familiar. And so he goes back and he looks at it and he said I know who this ring belongs to. I'm the one that made it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now think about it because so so he so he gets on the phone and he calls Gail and he says Gail. She said, "Hey, what what's going on?" He said, "Uh, what's uh where's your ring?" And she said, "Oh Lord, you're not going to believe it." And and and it's gone. And and he and he told her a little bit of the story. He said, "I'll call you back." He said, "I've got your ring. Give me a few minutes." And he hung up and he called the police department. So he stepped back out and the man was there and the man was all anxious said, "Hey, you know, am I going to uh uh am I going to get what I was wanting?" He said, "You're going to get a lot more than what you was wanting." About that time, the city police was walking in. Now you think about it because out of all the hundreds &gt;&gt; of pawn shops, jewelry stores, &gt;&gt; every kind of hot come on hawk shop that that there would be. Amen. The the devil took it right back. &gt;&gt; To the one that made it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. HE BROUGHT IT RIGHT BACK TO THE one that could really identify it. &gt;&gt; He brought it right back to the ONE THAT SAYS, "I KNOW THAT. I MADE THAT." &gt;&gt; I'm the one that made that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're thinking with me. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, that devil will take you right back. &gt;&gt; Amen. To the very one &gt;&gt; that says, "I made them." Amen. That's my son. Amen. That's my daughter. Amen. She was all tore up. She said, "Uh, you know, uh, has is it damaged? Is it HAS IT LOST VALUE?" HE SAID, "CALM DOWN." He said, "I've cleaned it up." He said, "And I'll GIVE YOU A FRESH APPRAISAL." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's worth more now, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; than it was when he walked out. When your husband walked out of here with it." &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'M SAYING, LISTEN, GOD knows the value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. AMEN. GOD KNOWS HOW TO REALLY IDENTIFY. &gt;&gt; OH, come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I say thank God. Amen. That he brought us right back. Amen. And act.
