[11:35] loving grace be with each one of us we
[11:38] love you in Jesus name Amen
[11:41] let's go to Colossians 3 and we'll begin
[11:48] reading the verse 9 down through verse
[11:51] 11 by not one to another seeing that you
[11:56] have put off the old man with his deeds
[11:58] if we put them off we don't need to be
[12:01] lying to nobody right cuz that's not
[12:04] part of us okay you see what he's saying
[12:06] and how put on the new man which is
[12:09] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[12:12] him that created him where there is
[12:15] neither Greek nor Jew circumcision
[12:17] uncircumcision by variance in theand
[12:20] bond or free but Christ is all and in
[12:25] all
[12:26] all right now let's go to Ephesians 4
[12:31] we'll start reading in verse 4 there is
[12:38] one body on one spirit even as ye are
[12:41] called in one hope of your calling one
[12:44] Lord one faith one baptism one God and
[12:48] Father of all who is above all and
[12:51] through all and in you all amen
[12:56] he's kind of southern in him in you all
[12:59] you may be seated
[13:00] Lord had his blessing - reading of the
[13:03] word I like Paul in that he's he just
[13:11] gets the point across
[13:13] all right then we we've been on this
[13:16] dope we're talking about God being
[13:21] hauled and all coming down through to
[13:25] speak on you know these points because I
[13:29] want you to see that and follow me in
[13:33] the way that I try to present what I'm
[13:36] over what I'm doing and my point is is
[13:39] to see how that we believe firmly in one
[13:43] true and living God all right and Jesus
[13:47] is his name that's just enough to solve
[13:51] the whole print thing but we believe in
[13:53] one true and living God we don't God had
[13:56] many manifestations all right you can
[14:02] say well is it necessary that we
[14:05] understand or say about one God and the
[14:09] truth of the Bible and you'd say well is
[14:13] it necessary that we go through and
[14:15] understand the one God because he knows
[14:18] who he is
[14:20] you've heard people say it like that
[14:22] well then why don't we just go Tarpon
[14:26] the Bible throw it away and just say
[14:28] what we want to say cuz he knows who he
[14:30] is
[14:32] did you listen to that see your point is
[14:36] well you'd say well do we need to know
[14:37] these things about the Bible because he
[14:40] knows who he is
[14:41] well my point is do we need to do
[14:43] anything right in the Bible if we're
[14:45] going that away cuz he knows who he is
[14:47] so what does it matter you know let's
[14:50] just eat drink and be merry because
[14:52] tomorrow we die but I don't I'm not in
[14:55] that way I'm one firm believer in one
[14:58] thing if God can keep his Bible straight
[15:01] and I believe he has all right we don't
[15:05] believe in any contradictions that's
[15:07] within it we believe in man in
[15:09] contradictory but there's no
[15:13] contradictions in the Word of God
[15:15] alright now I'm saying it this way I
[15:18] believe he can keep it straight now if
[15:20] he can't keep it straight
[15:23] well are you listening I believe God has
[15:27] if it's trading it's right but if he
[15:29] can't keep it straight we need to find
[15:31] us another guy I mean that's just flying
[15:34] language that's not throwing on nobody
[15:37] or no stones at nothing but just telling
[15:39] it like it is if he can't keep his words
[15:43] straight he's not God well we've had man
[15:47] to do this I don't care what man to do a
[15:48] lot it's whether or not it's revealed to
[15:51] you anyway so you have to believe it and
[15:54] see whether God has made known or reveal
[15:57] go see we read are called in in the
[15:59] Ephesians where he says there's one Lord
[16:01] one faith one baptism one God and Father
[16:07] of us all well that's not trinitarianism
[16:12] there's just one true and living God and
[16:14] God has manifested itself and that's
[16:17] what I'm trying to get you to follow a
[16:20] line of understanding the Godhead more
[16:23] than just quotes from brother Branham of
[16:26] a statement of this or that or the other
[16:28] is to get you to see back in your Bible
[16:33] and read your Bible instead of your
[16:35] Bible to see God all the way down
[16:38] through the same God the Jehovah the Old
[16:42] Testaments we call it he's Jesus of the
[16:45] new right because he's just the one true
[16:49] and living God all right
[16:51] he then being that God then we watched
[16:54] him as he unveils his self and brother
[16:59] branham does it in such a masterpiece of
[17:02] terminologies because you know he was
[17:04] 7th grade education but that we don't
[17:08] believe in and being ignorant but we
[17:11] don't believe in going over the other
[17:13] way we believe that God can speak to
[17:16] anyone Paul was a great very intelligent
[17:19] man you know the greatest of all
[17:22] intelligence of the time under Camejo
[17:25] and those that had the great
[17:27] understanding and it was fine and he had
[17:30] a great knowledge all right but yet he
[17:34] said I count everything that I've ever
[17:35] learned to be dung that I may win Christ
[17:40] in other words he said if I don't have
[17:43] Christ living within me all of my
[17:46] intelligences work nothing now so we
[17:51] don't lean over here to say well we
[17:53] can't understand neither do we go over
[17:57] this away say well we don't need to
[17:59] understand because we all we're so smart
[18:02] no we need a revelation from God because
[18:06] that's the only way you can ever be
[18:08] saved you're not saved just cause you
[18:10] join a church or a site of creed or or
[18:13] believe a code of rules or a a doctrinal
[18:17] issue you know or anything because you
[18:20] can do this no you're saved by grace
[18:22] through faith that not of works lest it
[18:25] be you know in vain it would totally be
[18:29] in vain to try to make anything out of
[18:31] works because once you get something
[18:32] working here and it's going the devil's
[18:35] gonna cut that off you start on
[18:36] something else so it won't do no good
[18:37] all right but trying to get the thought
[18:40] across to where we can follow it
[18:43] throughout the Bible okay now then we've
[18:48] been on the point of studying it for
[18:50] quite a little bit that the Prophet used
[18:53] the terminology is like this he said God
[18:55] came in three sons named son of man son
[19:01] of God son of David all right now that
[19:06] will cover the entire journey of the
[19:08] Bible and see we don't need something
[19:15] else to place within it
[19:17] we just need understanding or
[19:19] clarification
[19:20] to our understanding all right because
[19:23] the Bible says even the eternal Godhead
[19:26] can be understood by the things that we
[19:29] see I'm a human I'm a son you know a dad
[19:36] you know I'm a pastor of a church I'm a
[19:39] retired General Motors employee I'm all
[19:42] kind of titles but I only have one night
[19:46] and in doing that then I don't have to
[19:49] worry about confusing something you say
[19:53] ah Jesus
[20:01] Jesus was Almighty God in human flesh or
[20:07] else he lied he was either that or he
[20:11] lied and that's my point if we can't
[20:14] keep things straight to know God and to
[20:16] understand God then we needed this throw
[20:19] away everything we got because we can't
[20:22] go to the intellect to try to figure it
[20:24] out but neither that we need to go to
[20:26] stupidity to try to pass at all we need
[20:29] to believe what God says in his word all
[20:32] right
[20:32] he said I'm God not saying he's not all
[20:35] right jesus said I come in my father's
[20:37] name well those things are simple if we
[20:40] listen to it
[20:42] i'ma deal why because my daddy was a
[20:45] Dale and it's simple you know if he'd
[20:49] have been a Jones I'd have better Jones
[20:51] that's you know it's no problem all
[20:54] right
[20:54] you see he said I come in my father's
[20:56] name well isn't it his father's name had
[20:59] to be Jesus because that's the only name
[21:01] God ever had then think about what we're
[21:08] saying he came in three sons named son
[21:12] of man would cover the entire Old
[21:16] Testament the prophets and they're
[21:20] speaking and then he would have to come
[21:24] up on earth and in Matthew Mark Luke and
[21:26] John is I've tried to cover he would
[21:28] have to come and and make yourself known
[21:31] so he never declared himself openly
[21:34] publicly to mankind as the Son of God
[21:37] because he was not manifesting that at
[21:40] the time he declared himself as son of
[21:42] man or huh and see he had to give his
[21:46] life release that that was within him
[21:49] which was the Spirit of Almighty God
[21:52] the very soul spirit being of God
[21:55] dwelling because the Bible said in him
[21:57] dwelleth all news of the Godhead bodily
[21:59] all right so then when he released that
[22:01] he was able to come back on the church
[22:03] on the day of Pentecost and could be
[22:07] made manifest
[22:07] as the holy spirit coming in to the
[22:11] people and given his own life all right
[22:15] so now there's where you changed
[22:17] dispensations or thoughts or whatever
[22:20] you want to call it but keeps the same
[22:22] person the same person that was living
[22:25] on earth in a human flesh that we call
[22:28] Jesus in a few days was living in a
[22:32] group of people called the bride of
[22:35] Jesus Christ same God not a different
[22:38] one oh yeah but you just don't
[22:40] understand brother Dale that we
[22:44] understand all this like I said we
[22:47] either take what God says or we forget
[22:50] it
[22:50] because there's no need of playing with
[22:54] things is to say in the right order and
[22:56] keep it all right we'll see down through
[22:58] the age we call the churchy ages or time
[23:01] from Pentecost to where we are now it's
[23:06] been son of God
[23:08] okay now he's in the next stage if we
[23:12] take a trip to had been as we went
[23:14] through would be the millennial reign
[23:15] which is to the Jews and that son of
[23:18] David which was promised to David that
[23:23] his son would sit on his strong will his
[23:26] natural son is Solomon with that
[23:29] wouldn't the promise that was the
[23:30] promise that Jesus Christ would sit on
[23:33] the throne in the millennial reign all
[23:36] right and that would be to her that we
[23:39] could see my son of man son of God son
[23:41] of David all right now in between there
[23:45] we saw the the mystery part of get this
[23:48] and we'll move on to the difference we
[23:50] saw the part that something has to
[23:52] happen because how can you go from son
[23:56] of god the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:58] which is to the Gentiles nations with
[24:02] Gentiles means nations I don't mean it
[24:05] Jew can't be saved but you can be saved
[24:07] in this dispensation anybody can be
[24:10] saved in this dispensation that accepts
[24:12] Jesus Christ because that's why it's
[24:14] called a Gentile it means nations all
[24:19] over are see then
[24:21] nations can come forth and receive but
[24:24] then when he turns back to the Jews
[24:26] that's an entirely new group of people
[24:28] so you're going from the Son of God the
[24:31] Son of David let's see that won't work
[24:34] so we went through brought all the
[24:35] things down to where we could understand
[24:38] that God just in the last part he kept
[24:41] promising it in the days when the son of
[24:44] man he said would be revealed he said
[24:48] who the man say i the son of man now I
[24:50] said you're the Christ the Son of the
[24:52] Living God he said flesh and blood
[24:54] didn't reveal that under thee my father
[24:57] said I'll build my church on that uh-huh
[25:00] one who he was he said one day I'll come
[25:03] back when we believe in a restoration we
[25:07] believe in jaw that I will restore all
[25:09] things you see there stood on earth
[25:11] guarding human flesh he said what do you
[25:14] expect in the last days brother Dale I
[25:16] expect God to be living in human flesh
[25:20] not one person no no not one person in
[25:26] the body of Jesus Christ be the bride
[25:29] the church is you would call it in some
[25:32] of your terminologies the Bride of
[25:34] Christ would be actually become to that
[25:37] then it could take a change of these
[25:39] bodies we're gonna have to have
[25:41] something cause this to me change but if
[25:44] not we just keep on dying well so then
[25:47] to fulfill the scripture see we line up
[25:50] son of God I mean son of man son of God
[25:53] come back just a little bit in the end
[25:55] time a son of man and then some go to
[25:59] son of David like I say it I wrote this
[26:02] work they can say you say do we need to
[26:06] understand this point well we don't need
[26:12] to understand the Bible then let's throw
[26:14] it away
[26:17] right I mean we don't need to understand
[26:20] it let's throw it away it's not a good
[26:23] book to live by you know what I'm
[26:27] talking about
[26:27] this book's hard to live by
[26:31] right they couldn't do it no Testament
[26:36] and we sure can't do it now so we don't
[26:41] go buy something we can do or live by we
[26:43] go buy what he can do or what he can
[26:46] make us alright see then is it important
[26:51] to understand is it important to be
[26:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:55] Christ or why not go back to the
[26:57] Catholic Church to take a father-son ole
[26:58] to go because that's where it comes from
[27:03] well 325 a day you started picking it up
[27:07] 606 you started all of those times back
[27:11] there and then you started changing
[27:13] things I can show you according to your
[27:15] own dictionary where it says the
[27:18] Catholic Church changed it and made it
[27:20] Father Son and Holy Ghost coat
[27:22] I mean what Jesus say it he said
[27:24] baptized in the name of the Father and
[27:26] of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[27:28] that's not three names that's Lord Jesus
[27:31] Christ father son holy go Lord Jesus
[27:34] Christ
[27:35] alright so we're getting the point now
[27:37] to get it is it important to understand
[27:42] well why is it in the Bible if it's not
[27:47] important to understand yeah well you
[27:50] don't think we can understand everything
[27:51] now but we can understand what we can we
[27:54] don't have no right to deny any of it
[27:56] that's true so we follow it so then you
[28:00] got three sons named son of man son of
[28:02] God son of David everything that God
[28:07] reveals to mankind is made known through
[28:10] those three titles or thoughts
[28:16] everything is in that taking you all the
[28:19] way because Darwin Almighty God and they
[28:22] said come through the Old Testament
[28:24] showed himself through the prophets in
[28:28] the things that was taking place then he
[28:31] comes into human flesh and then he gives
[28:35] that life to where that life can come
[28:37] back into even me or through the church
[28:39] under there Pentecost and as it did
[28:43] then he's living in us Paul said Christ
[28:46] in you the hope of glory
[28:48] he said the life that I now live I live
[28:51] by the faith of the Son of God like I
[28:55] said a moment ago he was blunt he was a
[28:58] smart very highly educated man but he
[29:01] said I come that to be dumb you know
[29:06] that I may win Christ
[29:08] I may have Christ living within me
[29:11] he said cuz that's what I want is Christ
[29:13] to be made known that should be the goal
[29:16] or thought of any Christian doesn't
[29:18] matter who you are a child or you know
[29:20] children or what if you only claim to be
[29:22] a Christian will be trying to live like
[29:24] one I live like the devil claim to be
[29:29] Christians because that's not the point
[29:32] all right but now we came down to the
[29:35] point of what that he was he is to
[29:39] return in the last days from according
[29:42] to Malachi 4 according to Luke 1730 and
[29:47] the day when the Son of Man would be
[29:49] revealed God coming back to live upon
[29:54] this earth the way he started out the
[29:57] way he wanted to come back as the full
[29:59] word a full restoration would come and
[30:06] it would bring forth and ensure that the
[30:09] hour that we're living would come up to
[30:11] be to where this endtime message was
[30:14] sent to show Thessalonians he that the
[30:18] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[30:19] with a shout voice of an archangel in
[30:22] the trumpet the dead in Christ shall
[30:24] rise first then we which are alive and
[30:25] remain will be changed the whole thing
[30:28] is in the Bible under one of those terms
[30:31] son of man son of God son of David see
[30:37] then we we tried to pick it up into a
[30:39] higher form of understanding to where we
[30:45] can see the day that we're living we're
[30:48] in a period of time that we're fixing to
[30:52] change dispensation
[30:54] because God is going to leave the the
[30:57] Gentile dispensation very shortly that
[31:00] ain't no time elements I said that fifty
[31:03] years ago I'm talking like that I'm just
[31:05] saying it that he will change
[31:08] dispensations one day and he'll turn
[31:10] back to the Jews according to the Bible
[31:12] because that's what the word says
[31:14] alright he'll turn back to them once he
[31:17] turns back to them the then the Gentiles
[31:20] will be over with we'll see finding
[31:24] ourselves in the word to see what's
[31:26] taking place seeing the hour that we're
[31:32] living and seeing how that God wants to
[31:36] live in his people we read there in the
[31:38] scripture that God may be all and at all
[31:44] now that doesn't mean everybody in the
[31:46] world
[31:48] see now well you got your Bible that's
[31:52] where people don't understand they don't
[31:54] think in other words I can tell you the
[31:58] Bible says everybody's gonna be saved
[32:02] was that out of it they said that God
[32:05] may be all and in all well you mean it
[32:10] no that's not what it's saying it's not
[32:17] saying that everybody in the world will
[32:19] be saved you know what I just read it
[32:25] yeah but you read it from your human
[32:30] terminologies or thoughts that you just
[32:33] read words off a page the all of God
[32:39] will be saved yes all who are his
[32:43] children all who are who accept Jesus
[32:47] Christ as our Savior truly do now not
[32:50] make believe or truly accept Jesus
[32:53] Christ as our Savior then that's the all
[32:55] of God all of them will be saved but not
[33:03] everybody in the world that's what it's
[33:05] saying your point I'm trying to get you
[33:07] to look at
[33:07] well I'm telling you what the Bible says
[33:11] the Bible says always going to be saved
[33:16] no but your human terminologies of your
[33:19] mind order you would have plain sense
[33:21] enough to know that ain't right
[33:23] what are you doing that away what's any
[33:25] purpose of any time it's not saying what
[33:29] we think it is see just like I was
[33:31] saying our moment ago see the Bible
[33:34] Jesus said baptize in the name of the
[33:35] Father another son you know the Holy
[33:38] Ghost you say where'd he say he said in
[33:43] the scriptures in my name or in the name
[33:47] singular a father son don't go what is
[33:52] the name singular father Lord Jesus was
[33:57] son Christ is the Anointed One to come
[34:01] and live in us so why do you how do we
[34:03] about - in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:04] Christ you know but you're not doing
[34:07] what the Bible said yes I am but the
[34:12] world system is not taking what the
[34:15] Bible says they're taking how they read
[34:18] that like a man said it worked one day
[34:22] said and I'm not against Catholic I just
[34:25] use words alright and he said you're
[34:28] saying that the Catholics baptize wrong
[34:29] I says well according to the Bible
[34:31] it's all I'm saying and he said how many
[34:34] Catholics are thee in the world I said I
[34:36] don't know millions of millions of
[34:39] millions you know you know he said you
[34:45] mean they're all wrong and you're right
[34:46] I said no they're all wrong the Bible's
[34:52] right I ain't gonna do whether I'm right
[34:56] or wrong
[34:56] ain't tell my dad I'm talking about what
[34:58] the Bible says
[35:00] well it says father son Holy Ghost
[35:05] that's true Lord Jesus Christ his father
[35:09] son odigo our law I don't have no money
[35:13] in the bank but got a little bit anybody
[35:16] needs a couple hundred dollars I'll
[35:17] write you a check
[35:21] to give it to you you know for little
[35:24] money you say what you're getting that
[35:26] cuz it ain't gonna be no good if I don't
[35:28] put a name on it I can put titles pastor
[35:33] I can put this I can put Jim employee I
[35:37] can put all kind of titles but if I
[35:40] don't sign that name that cheque ain't
[35:42] gonna be no good well that's the way the
[35:45] Bible is if we don't take what the Bible
[35:49] says then we don't have to worry about
[35:51] the rest of it they don't even be in
[35:55] concern if we're not gonna believe it as
[35:56] being God's Word in other words my point
[35:59] is if I don't believe enough to know
[36:02] that God that created the world and I
[36:06] believe he did you know right I believe
[36:10] he created the world I believe he
[36:11] brought everything into being if he's
[36:13] not able to keep his word straight then
[36:17] we need to go out in the universe
[36:19] somewhere and find us another God yeah
[36:22] you're just silly no you're the Hornet
[36:24] silly I'm just telling it like it is we
[36:27] need to find another God if he can't
[36:29] keep his word but see he's always kept
[36:32] it it's always been true so we follow
[36:36] what he says all right
[36:38] see then the Bible is not revealing many
[36:41] gods because he we take that no no I
[36:46] come from the Baptist I'm not throwing
[36:48] those stones but we taught that he was
[36:50] was co-equal and coeternal God in three
[36:56] persons when that how can he be Co
[36:59] eternal if it's Father Son Holy Ghost
[37:05] one of them supposed to be older in the
[37:06] other one one supposed to create the
[37:09] other two or something some idea well
[37:13] see my point of what I'm getting at is
[37:16] either we believe the Bible or we don't
[37:18] believe it and then we follow it and the
[37:23] Prophet didn't come to teach us
[37:25] something contrary to the Bible he come
[37:29] to dis shorts what the Bible was plainly
[37:30] saying because that's what Paul was
[37:34] doing
[37:34] but shows what it was saying all right
[37:38] so now he comes in three sons named he
[37:43] coming son of man all the way down
[37:45] through the Old Testament then through
[37:46] the the gospel writings of Matthew Mark
[37:49] Luke and John the life of Christ then he
[37:53] wasn't seen this son of man down through
[37:55] the church ages
[37:56] he was seen as son of God which is all
[37:59] the spirit the new birth coming into the
[38:01] heart of mankind
[38:02] but to come back in the end time just
[38:04] for a little bit the Prophet said in
[38:06] between we gave you these quote in
[38:09] between the son of God and the son of
[38:12] David he comes back for a little while
[38:14] as son of man because that would come
[38:17] back to give us hopes of a change of
[38:19] these bodies and things that we could
[38:22] have a hope in this day because it would
[38:25] be a restoration back to the original
[38:28] God that walked on the shores of Galilee
[38:30] all right
[38:32] not brother branham see we don't believe
[38:34] in that we're not that that goes so far
[38:36] until it ain't even worth talking about
[38:39] so I said y'all believe brother Branham
[38:41] was God no I told him a fair man was
[38:45] standing in jeffersonville one day and
[38:47] he said we're talking about brother
[38:48] Branham being gone I said you know it is
[38:51] and I said listen I said I'll believe
[38:54] I'll talk to you about deity if you'll
[38:56] talk to me about he was trying to say
[39:00] brother Ryan was deity nothing I said if
[39:02] you'll go with me I'll go you go don't
[39:04] ask you one question
[39:05] any born-again believer has deity living
[39:08] inside of them which is Christ
[39:09] I said you agree they said yeah I said
[39:12] all right now if you'll tell me now
[39:14] pointed over I said you you tell me that
[39:16] brother there has the baptism of the
[39:18] Holy Ghost and he's just as much deities
[39:21] brother Branham was then I go along with
[39:23] you he said no way I said goodbye
[39:30] because I didn't have no more time to be
[39:33] fooling around see he was saying brother
[39:36] Brandon was dead we don't believe in
[39:37] that no there's only one true and living
[39:40] God if you try to make deities out of it
[39:45] you're breaking the scriptures and
[39:47] everything else
[39:48] you know but we believe God's Word is to
[39:50] be fulfilled in our day alright cuz see
[39:55] then when you change dispensations here
[39:58] in the last days which is I say the
[40:01] moment ago nobody knows when we're not
[40:03] talking about that but there will be a
[40:06] town come that God will go back to the
[40:09] Jews to fulfill the scripture alright
[40:13] and the brain goes people out of the
[40:15] Jews back into the lineage lineup and as
[40:20] he does the he'll be revealing himself
[40:23] to them the same way he reveals himself
[40:26] to me and you cuz he'll go through two
[40:34] prophets they called out 244,000 right
[40:39] those two prophets name that will be the
[40:43] Son of man standing on earth in his
[40:45] life's two witnesses that he brings on
[40:47] earth and he'll bring that word and
[40:51] they'll see Christ and they then must
[40:55] accept that Christ as they see it sort
[40:59] of go from son of man son of God and
[41:03] then those two witnesses will tell them
[41:06] after they've received the word and and
[41:09] the things for their day to give them
[41:11] life all right those two prophets will
[41:16] explain something amazing to those Jews
[41:19] that they wouldn't have today for
[41:21] nothing in the world they ki if you try
[41:23] to talk to them about it but to tell
[41:26] them that they missed the point of
[41:28] children of God they turn when they turn
[41:32] Jesus Christ down see they miss that
[41:36] when he goes to those Jews all this has
[41:39] got to be explained to them and they'll
[41:43] realize that a Gentile group of people
[41:45] come in and fill the kingdom see then
[41:51] they pull apart weep and everything else
[41:53] according to fulfilling the Scriptures
[41:55] because they are they become then the
[41:57] people of God which will be eunuchs to
[42:01] the brow
[42:02] you know the whole story alright and see
[42:06] then it'll be told and said you miss
[42:08] that you miss that son of man that that
[42:12] Gentile dispensation took and believed
[42:15] it the God could speak to mankind and
[42:21] not just speak to him by prophet but yet
[42:24] he could come in and make that people of
[42:26] prophetic people what a prophetic people
[42:32] well why not we're the children of God
[42:35] why don't you believe if you being a
[42:38] child of God you you have eternal life
[42:41] living in you right by the new birth
[42:44] you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[42:45] Savior right and by having Christ living
[42:48] in you then why don't you accept the
[42:52] fact of what he's made you don't explain
[42:56] what that God may be all in all bringing
[43:04] it in this day to an understanding that
[43:07] what we see the future look how
[43:12] marvelous it is like I said you think it
[43:15] ain't gonna be a shock to those Jews
[43:17] when they realize one day that they
[43:20] crucified their Messiah
[43:22] the Bible says they'll pull apart and
[43:24] why cry for days well cuz they realized
[43:29] they realized not only did they reject
[43:32] Jesus Christ they rejected him as being
[43:35] Almighty God turned him down and that
[43:41] they've been under judgment ever since
[43:43] then which they called out on herself
[43:46] gonna remember and they chose that it's
[43:49] blood be on us well it's been on the
[43:51] Jews ever since
[43:53] you see those Jews one day we'll see
[43:57] what's taking place and when they do
[44:01] then they'll have a change of the body
[44:04] then they'll have a resurrection because
[44:07] they're all gonna be killed according to
[44:08] the book of Revelation the Beast is
[44:12] gonna kill all of them
[44:15] all right and when it does then they're
[44:18] going to raise up the same redemption we
[44:21] get we all wind up in the Millennium
[44:23] together that's what I love about it I
[44:26] love the way the Prophet said it
[44:29] whatever puts the Jews in the Millennium
[44:31] I'll put you in I in the Millennium
[44:33] well what puts the Jews in the
[44:35] Millennium accepting Jesus Christ and no
[44:41] one had realized that the point that
[44:43] they've lost or turned down and
[44:46] accepting him to be their Savior and
[44:49] Redeemer and see that he's already
[44:52] brought the bride through and took her
[44:55] in so then we're not going to the sees
[45:01] to us it doesn't matter in the
[45:03] Millennium he'll be sitting on the
[45:05] throne of David we'll be sitting around
[45:06] him but we don't have to have anything
[45:09] to do with that part we're an hour on
[45:11] the honeymoon that's the best way to say
[45:13] it that's as good a thought as anybody
[45:15] could get out of it the bride's got her
[45:18] the time though are the chickens through
[45:21] the Millennium ring and she walking the
[45:24] garden of God and like I told you you
[45:28] got a job to do
[45:30] we're supposed to be living examples of
[45:33] Christianity right that others may see
[45:35] Christ living in us you realize when
[45:38] we're in that millennial reign will be
[45:40] able to explain to those Jews on all of
[45:43] those things minute you realize
[45:47] according to the scripture they tell be
[45:50] a millennium temple to be built in the
[45:54] millennium and being there in the
[45:59] millennium in that temple see not a
[46:02] temple doll for sacrifices of that no
[46:04] but it be the temple setting there that
[46:07] you can explain to them Jews what they
[46:09] missed see there's not gonna be no
[46:13] temple in the future home because the
[46:18] Lord and the lamb are the temple there
[46:19] ain't gonna be no not ain't go no no day
[46:22] inside the city goes the lamb is the
[46:26] light you think it's hard
[46:28] understand let me say it to you this way
[46:30] you realize one of these days is gonna
[46:32] be no need of the moon the Stars the Sun
[46:37] in the future home there'll be no need
[46:39] of that well because the lamb the Bible
[46:44] said is the light well how can one man
[46:48] be enough to light the world you get in
[46:52] a dark room and strike a match right
[46:56] you know don't matter how dark it is I
[46:59] mean you'll be 500 feet underground
[47:04] George one time with my denim
[47:08] McMinnville up then went on all that
[47:10] stuff two or three slept about through
[47:12] 22.2 and 300 feet on the ground you know
[47:16] what we're really happy to keep flights
[47:17] like then you had an extra one just in
[47:22] case that didn't work because once you
[47:25] got in there so far they wouldn't know
[47:26] turnaround coming by and you certainly
[47:28] didn't want to turn off on one of the
[47:30] side roads they cautioned you that they
[47:34] don't turn right or left said just go
[47:36] straight as much as you can and
[47:38] sometimes he'd walk up against the wall
[47:40] and you'd be standing there like this
[47:42] and a big old wall and you look up and
[47:48] you look around with your flashlight and
[47:49] there's nowhere to go you look down at
[47:52] the floor make a little place about this
[47:54] big about like to help you got to go
[47:57] through that hole well I I didn't have
[48:00] quite as much they got now but I made it
[48:03] through but my point of what you say in
[48:09] that little light you realize they won't
[48:14] need be no need of a lot in that city
[48:16] because everywhere he's at will be
[48:18] daylight there won't be no moon when we
[48:21] don't stars they don't Sun in the future
[48:24] hope and the Millennium there will be
[48:27] because it'll how dates and times and
[48:29] seasons things into millennium but in
[48:31] the future home you won't have it it's
[48:34] what I said you think it's hard to
[48:36] understand a lot of you can you
[48:38] understand can you fathom one person
[48:41] stand
[48:42] in a world system could light it every
[48:44] bit up my god can whether yours can make
[48:52] it or not mine can you know what he put
[48:55] that in me so everywhere I go that God
[48:59] may be all and in all and so it's trying
[49:07] to end up there the other day on the
[49:08] message trying to understand all in all
[49:11] do you realize if that scripture is
[49:15] correct then God is living in you well
[49:22] we said he's the light of the world
[49:24] the scripture says you're the light of
[49:25] the world come on
[49:30] read your Bible scripture says you the
[49:32] light of the world the scripture said in
[49:37] him there's no darkness well if there's
[49:40] no darkness then everywhere he goes his
[49:43] light whatever where you go is locked
[49:49] and not lightning verbs you know
[49:52] flashing because they ain't gonna be
[49:53] turning the fire on and off you know see
[50:00] we we try to say well we don't
[50:03] understand a lot of the Bible it's plain
[50:06] if we just believe it in him there's no
[50:11] darkness well if there's no darkness
[50:13] everywhere he's that would have to be
[50:15] light that's sensible won't be no light
[50:21] bugs and Georgia power trying to run the
[50:23] whole thing it just means the Bible
[50:31] fulfilled but it says there in
[50:34] revelation 22 you have no need of the of
[50:37] the Sun you have no need of those things
[50:38] well cause he's the light well if he's
[50:44] the light then if he's living in you
[50:46] what does that make you
[50:52] do you realize that the only way you can
[50:57] see Jesus Christ is by looking at
[51:01] someone else that's making that manifest
[51:05] are you with me yeah but I just believe
[51:10] this I believe that know somebody helps
[51:13] you or directed you led you open the
[51:17] world unto you talk to you about Jesus
[51:19] Christ preached to you mama holding you
[51:23] rocking you telling you about it just
[51:27] think about Moses his mother now God
[51:34] worked out all out right they needed a
[51:39] nurse a wet mother he would call it
[51:41] because they didn't have bottles and
[51:43] stuff like that you know so they got a
[51:48] wet mother take care of it well who was
[51:50] the wet mother to took care of Moses
[51:52] Moses little sister said I know a wet
[51:54] mother where I can go get her I know
[51:56] somebody that can let that child nurse
[51:58] and raise it one over there got Moses no
[52:01] mother God worked the whole thing out
[52:05] who's surprised of the Egyptians he put
[52:09] him right in to her that he could come
[52:11] out to be ruler and just think about her
[52:17] sitting there every day rocking him
[52:19] you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[52:25] he never raised up thinking about he
[52:28] belong to Pharaoh I we see the movies
[52:30] but remember movies ain't according to
[52:33] the Bible there according to selling
[52:35] Pete to people to get them to come to
[52:37] the movie you know I mean you see these
[52:41] movies you think about a third over his
[52:43] ride
[52:44] maybe the country they're putting it in
[52:46] about the only thing it's any good right
[52:51] here she sit there all day you know
[52:53] you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[52:57] you're an Israelite and one day you're
[53:01] going to be ruler little
[53:05] all his life raised up listening to that
[53:13] she opened the light of the word to him
[53:18] and he just stood on it when he got
[53:20] through the time and he needed to give
[53:24] her brother Dale I saw the movie and
[53:28] that's what I mean not the best thing
[53:31] I've the ten commandments that you can
[53:33] get anything out of it is worth of
[53:35] writing on the Ten Commandments and
[53:38] turned out and it burnt out and put the
[53:40] commandments out all the rest of it is
[53:43] somebody's idea what this was or that
[53:45] was no like I've always said you tell me
[53:49] how come
[53:50] Pharaoh when Moses come back after
[53:55] they'd run run him out and he comes back
[53:58] up why didn't that King this they cut
[54:02] his throat he's afraid of him because he
[54:08] knew who he was he's afraid he's caused
[54:12] insurrection rose up against him take
[54:15] over why didn't the king that's that cut
[54:17] his throat see God had so placed it
[54:21] until they had to agree with everything
[54:23] all right listen to what I'm saying
[54:28] truth in the all and all
[54:39] all in all with one little part of the
[54:44] scripture that Jesus said that that day
[54:48] you'll know that I'm in the father
[54:53] you and me 9 you like I've always
[55:00] preached to you it's easy to understand
[55:02] what Jesus is saying when he's saying I
[55:05] knew right because by the new birth he
[55:12] comes with inside of it but explain the
[55:14] other where he says and you and me
[55:19] that's what he said
[55:21] he said I knew you and me so that that
[55:23] day you'll understand
[55:24] the day of this revelation you'll
[55:28] understand this I and you and you and me
[55:31] I didn't even good sense oh you're
[55:39] strong talking about the Bible it ain't
[55:41] talked about the Bible that way the
[55:42] Bible's right the only way you'll ever
[55:46] understand the Bible is to some way find
[55:49] out who you are and what you're doing
[55:53] here then you begin to understand see
[55:57] when Jesus said I knew that was easy
[55:59] that's the new birth that comes and
[56:02] lives in us as making us the children of
[56:06] God
[56:07] but what about you and me how could we
[56:09] be part of God oh that's what it's
[56:13] saying I and you we understand that
[56:19] right but you and me we went back there
[56:24] with him when he was shores of Galilee
[56:25] we wasn't there with him when he was in
[56:28] life but when you think about
[56:36] he could be all and in all all and in
[56:44] all
[56:45] I explained that a minute ago it's not
[56:47] everybody gonna be safe all and in all
[56:50] that is saved because all that's saved
[56:55] are part of God he said wait just a
[56:59] minute now
[56:59] well do you how listen now do you have
[57:03] the new birth a simple language I said
[57:09] the other day you know you had going
[57:11] this way or that way it's gonna tell
[57:13] which way you are so if you have eternal
[57:19] life if you have the new birth whatever
[57:22] you want to call it new birth salvation
[57:24] born to get experience whatever your
[57:26] terminology is you want to use do you
[57:28] have the new birth well then you got
[57:31] Christ living in you so Jesus was right
[57:37] I'm gonna come and live in you and said
[57:42] when I put my life in you you're gonna
[57:44] be me made manifest is that not what the
[57:50] children of God are are we not his
[57:52] offspring is that not what Paul was
[57:56] doing on Mars hey up when you got up
[58:00] there talking to him and they had a
[58:02] little inscription there said to the
[58:03] unknown God go ahead all kind of idols
[58:08] and things set up you know within in
[58:09] case they missed somebody
[58:11] they just made one little space and said
[58:13] just in case we missed some God
[58:15] somewhere because that was their idea
[58:17] they studied the gods that's just in
[58:21] case did will put one right here
[58:25] Paul said now listen he said I want you
[58:29] to know that's the God I won't talk to
[58:31] you about he said I want to talk to you
[58:36] about the God that's living in me
[58:42] oh it's easy to talk about the God that
[58:45] walked ashore to Galilee and the God of
[58:47] this and the universe and a different
[58:49] thing but what about when you talk about
[58:51] the goddess living in you well I just
[58:58] don't understand I don't understand
[59:00] alright I'll talk we you own that if
[59:03] you'll just explain to me what I said
[59:05] while ago how can God Himself stand in
[59:10] the future home and it needs no light
[59:15] because he is the light you'll explain
[59:19] that to me we want no problem with the
[59:21] other because all you got to do is take
[59:23] that light and put it in another vessel
[59:25] right we sang that song this little
[59:29] light of mine I want to let it shine
[59:31] because you're the light of the world
[59:34] the only way people can see Jesus Christ
[59:37] and see him in you right well I read it
[59:45] the book well who wrote the book come on
[59:47] don't be that way with me you said well
[59:50] I I didn't hear nobody tell about it I
[59:52] read about well you read what somebody
[59:54] wrote you can't come to God without
[59:57] somebody helping you see that God may be
[1:00:07] all in all now we're coming to the point
[1:00:12] of what I'm trying to say what that that
[1:00:17] day you'll understand ain't you that's
[1:00:23] easier to understand he gave his life he
[1:00:26] comes lives in us and you and me now how
[1:00:30] can that be understood about you and me
[1:00:32] you can understand it by the life of God
[1:00:35] coming and living in you by the new
[1:00:38] birth then Paul said it's not all that
[1:00:42] liveth the Christ that liveth in me see
[1:00:47] that way you can see they all and they
[1:00:49] in all God is in all of those that are
[1:00:53] born again you can't be born again
[1:00:56] without God coming and living in you
[1:01:03] you're not a Christian because you join
[1:01:05] a church go to creator believe a doctor
[1:01:09] or an idea come on up we're in this
[1:01:13] people we call them in time message you
[1:01:16] know yourself the biggest portion of
[1:01:18] them think they're saved because they
[1:01:19] believe what the prophets said then you
[1:01:21] try to explain to them what the prophets
[1:01:23] said and they go haywire they think
[1:01:28] they're saved just because they believe
[1:01:30] the Prophet well I believe the Prophet
[1:01:33] every with this quote the scripture -
[1:01:35] why is it now they're on the internet
[1:01:37] trying to arrest to destroy this message
[1:01:40] the people they used to preach this
[1:01:42] message were they talking about I and
[1:01:49] you and you and me I want to know how we
[1:01:55] can be a part of God that's simple to me
[1:02:03] you just get born again and when you get
[1:02:08] born again you take the life of Christ
[1:02:12] that puts God in you so I knew and you
[1:02:18] and me I made a way he's saying for you
[1:02:23] to become my children and said I've come
[1:02:27] now to live in you that it may be all
[1:02:35] and in all you know all that are born
[1:02:40] again I go saying there the other day
[1:02:44] about it you know we think about the
[1:02:47] devil being smart you ain't a smart you
[1:02:51] had one man to face when Jesus was in
[1:02:53] the world and he left him alone and went
[1:02:56] off and let him go he'd have never had
[1:03:00] but one to face but he's done what he
[1:03:04] thought was right what he could news
[1:03:06] sure how good he got everything together
[1:03:08] and tried to get him killed
[1:03:10] by getting him killed he wound up with a
[1:03:12] hundred and twenty little Christ the
[1:03:16] first whack then he had three thousand
[1:03:20] the next he'd have been better off he
[1:03:24] hadn't touched nobody and to touch the
[1:03:26] Lord Jesus but he couldn't do that but
[1:03:30] he was a destroyer he was trying to
[1:03:34] destroy them the channel what's that
[1:03:37] he made way you see that's where we try
[1:03:43] to blind this blind that we try to blame
[1:03:45] the crucifixion of Jesus on the Jews no
[1:03:50] it was my sin that put him on the cross
[1:03:57] it wouldn't do that put him on the cross
[1:04:00] is my sins you realize that he would
[1:04:05] have died if had just been one person
[1:04:07] that would have accepted him he would
[1:04:09] have died for that one person as well as
[1:04:12] he would for the millions that he did
[1:04:13] die for because that's our loving Savior
[1:04:22] he made a way to come and live you know
[1:04:27] he started out back there in Genesis
[1:04:30] trying to contact man and live with him
[1:04:32] the man just kept pulling away pulling
[1:04:34] away going after his own idea it went so
[1:04:39] far away until they finally crucified
[1:04:41] the very God of glory they stood on this
[1:04:43] earth would you realize too that if that
[1:04:47] hadn't happened you wouldn't be a
[1:04:48] Christian today it wouldn't be a
[1:04:54] Christian today without the blood of
[1:04:55] Jesus Christ
[1:04:56] that's why wouldn't you know Gentile he
[1:04:58] was Almighty God he's DN DNA wouldn't
[1:05:04] match nobody in the world cuz he was
[1:05:07] Almighty God either that or the biggest
[1:05:10] liar there is as you know we believe in
[1:05:16] it by believing in it do you realize
[1:05:20] that he's in all he's in all those down
[1:05:24] the time that has accepted him as their
[1:05:27] Savior
[1:05:30] he lived in mankind all the way through
[1:05:33] that's what he's wanted to do now live
[1:05:37] in you and me that we could show the
[1:05:42] world him living is that the purpose of
[1:05:45] a Christian you realize that he died in
[1:05:51] our place you realized that all he wants
[1:05:55] us to do is to die you remember the Jim
[1:06:01] Jones outfit down there you know were
[1:06:04] there all those people died because of
[1:06:07] his philosophy the man at work asked his
[1:06:10] brother said the sound arsonist he ever
[1:06:14] try to get you to kill yourself he said
[1:06:19] every time he preaches he's beating only
[1:06:21] trying his best to kill me because if he
[1:06:25] can kill me I can be made alive in
[1:06:27] Christ because that should be our gold
[1:06:32] all the way through that God may be all
[1:06:35] do you understand the Scriptures know
[1:06:37] that God may be all and he's in all he's
[1:06:42] an all born-again believers all of them
[1:06:45] are his children his offspring and has
[1:06:51] given us an opportunity to be a part of
[1:06:54] that be a part of that Kingdom and it'll
[1:07:02] wind up one of these days we finished
[1:07:04] all here in this world then we'll see
[1:07:06] what the all in all really means because
[1:07:09] that's word with me you realize when we
[1:07:13] get there that will be the all of God we
[1:07:20] may not understand a lot of things but
[1:07:22] when we get dark we'll understand but it
[1:07:26] looked like we ought to be able to
[1:07:27] understand a little bit here if we're
[1:07:30] his children
[1:07:35] come on I've told you how I am on life's
[1:07:39] and I'm in lines and things it wouldn't
[1:07:44] matter to me if I found out that I
[1:07:47] wasn't born the day oh then my real name
[1:07:54] was Jones or something else and I could
[1:07:58] get millions of dollars by going
[1:08:00] accepting the fact of being a Jones you
[1:08:03] don't believe me you don't believe what
[1:08:06] I'm fixing to say but if I offered
[1:08:09] millions of dollars it's changed my name
[1:08:11] to a Jones and they you know deny my
[1:08:15] family I've died pauper because I go
[1:08:25] sell out my birthright my daddy and mama
[1:08:31] raised me dad died when I was about four
[1:08:34] mom raised me the baby of 13 she raised
[1:08:41] me you think I did not that it changed
[1:08:45] my name to Jones just because of a few
[1:08:47] million dollars I could get in my pocket
[1:08:49] you say you're stupid
[1:08:51] no I'm crazy I'm just crazy enough to
[1:08:55] you better believe it I'll do it cause
[1:08:59] money don't mean that nothing we got to
[1:09:03] have it to live but it don't mean a
[1:09:07] thing to me sold my house you've heard
[1:09:10] me tell the story sold it to my nephew
[1:09:14] my brother come along and offered me
[1:09:17] $5,000 profit to sell it to him he said
[1:09:21] you ain't sold it to him yet I said no
[1:09:22] but he's got my word I thought told him
[1:09:26] he could have it I don't care what you
[1:09:29] offer it will never take it away from
[1:09:31] cuz he's done done about it
[1:09:33] it was just stupid not be that's just
[1:09:37] where I am so that's the way I unknown
[1:09:41] Christianity either the Bible's rider is
[1:09:45] not
[1:09:47] either it's the Word of God or it's not
[1:09:49] the Word of God either it's true where
[1:09:54] it's not true and it has all the answers
[1:09:59] it's like I was talking about how can
[1:10:01] all be at all he's not in all the world
[1:10:04] he's in all born-again believers simple
[1:10:08] answer by being in a born-again believer
[1:10:11] then the simple scripts right Jesus said
[1:10:14] I in you and you and me if we just
[1:10:21] realized the opportunity as we have
[1:10:23] Christians that we have in this world
[1:10:30] brother Dan would you go run for
[1:10:32] president of the United States
[1:10:33] that'd be the biggest shame that could
[1:10:35] be thought of to ask me to lose leave
[1:10:38] the job I am to try to explain Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ to you and go the president of a
[1:10:44] whole world know we'll put budget but
[1:10:49] you could be president and you could
[1:10:50] take over
[1:10:51] that's Moses now you get the story
[1:10:56] Moses thought he could handle it right
[1:10:59] when they raised up what Moses dude he's
[1:11:02] killed in the gypsum what did he have
[1:11:07] when he got through a stinking dead
[1:11:09] Egyptian he didn't have no control of
[1:11:12] nothing he was thrown out of the country
[1:11:15] does he try to self what I love about it
[1:11:22] the Bible says that Moses saw the
[1:11:27] suffering of Christ and desired to stay
[1:11:32] with that he could have been the head of
[1:11:35] Egypt come on
[1:11:40] he could have took over but he saw
[1:11:45] Christ you said how did he see it
[1:11:48] because his mom kept telling him you're
[1:11:52] not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're
[1:11:58] the deliverer to come to the children of
[1:12:00] Israel
[1:12:00] to one day take us out of here right she
[1:12:06] told him all about it and one day he
[1:12:09] realized that he tried to deliver but he
[1:12:16] found out mom was experience wasn't
[1:12:18] enough he needed something else
[1:12:24] your mom and dad being a Christian
[1:12:27] that's wonderful great opportunity to be
[1:12:29] able to live up in a family like that
[1:12:30] but remember they don't save you all of
[1:12:36] Moses life he heard he was a deliverer
[1:12:39] but all he got was a stinking dead of
[1:12:42] the Egyptian I'm not throwing up on an
[1:12:44] Egyptian that's making it plain
[1:12:45] he got one person who went out when he
[1:12:51] got out the burning bush he said who are
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:57] bush was burning wouldn't burn up he
[1:13:00] said who are you he said I'm the God of
[1:13:02] Abraham Isaac and Jacob Moses learned
[1:13:09] more in five minutes and from the
[1:13:11] burning bush then he had all of his life
[1:13:13] in his mother's arms next thing you see
[1:13:18] him he's headed to Egypt to take over
[1:13:21] right knew for certain - he was facing
[1:13:26] death I mean that's what would you think
[1:13:29] if you got hurt done been run off one
[1:13:30] time and see if you come back you hit it
[1:13:34] just get the point he suffered Christ he
[1:13:38] saw that he saw that he was the
[1:13:40] deliverer but that he couldn't do it of
[1:13:42] his own he said now you tell me - the
[1:13:47] burning bush said you tell me who's
[1:13:49] gonna lead him out he said I am that I
[1:13:51] am he went to Egypt and delivered Israel
[1:13:59] from that statement because he things
[1:14:03] had changed he realized there was a he
[1:14:07] believed there was a God from his
[1:14:09] mother's testimony he believed in a God
[1:14:11] of Israel
[1:14:12] he could read the Huayra what you call
[1:14:15] those things the hieroglyphics or
[1:14:17] whatever they the writings of all of
[1:14:18] those people he could read all of those
[1:14:20] things and it would tell all about what
[1:14:22] had taken place because he kept records
[1:14:24] all the way through but that wouldn't
[1:14:27] enough the five minutes in front of a
[1:14:30] burning bush he's got his wife on a
[1:14:34] donkey in Hidden Egypt take over because
[1:14:42] he saw what his mama had told him in
[1:14:45] reality now listen to what I'm saying he
[1:14:51] believed from mama behind you Moses
[1:14:57] you're the guy to take him in his eye on
[1:14:59] you God's done done this that and the
[1:15:01] other but when he got to the burning
[1:15:04] bush that one in the burning bush spoke
[1:15:09] and said I'm sending you and remember
[1:15:13] the way God does it if he sends you then
