[0:00] he's gonna throw you guys off a little
[0:01] bit like that you get it like I say it's
[0:03] like a puzzle relations 28 elation 3 to
[0:11] 28 to 29
[0:14] so there are neither Jew nor Greek there
[0:18] is neither bond nor free view there is
[0:20] male or female for you all one in Christ
[0:25] Jesus and if you're being Christ then
[0:27] you're Abraham's seed and heirs
[0:29] according to the promise
[0:36] also the price of the Bride of Christ is
[0:39] male and female like Adam and Eve was
[0:41] there he had a male and the female had
[0:45] the same mom in the same DNA so
[0:57] see there's a cry in the land for a
[1:00] kingdom and there's a cry of a child was
[1:03] growing up without a father there was a
[1:06] crier for a woman who's given in age and
[1:10] can't find a man to marry who can't be
[1:13] responsible in every relationship you
[1:17] say there's a cry of churches where
[1:18] women volunteer for everything and men
[1:22] or am ia missing and I'm usually named
[1:26] Douglas he says that men who are here on
[1:34] earth can get their instruction by
[1:37] heaven but flush it out here below let's
[1:40] say in Greek God tells us what to do but
[1:42] we want we want to do what we want to do
[1:44] yeah so this is not our world we've been
[1:50] put place here to see the affairs of a
[1:54] king but a lot of men say oh I'm going
[1:57] to run it the way I want I want to do it
[2:01] [Music]
[2:06] there's not a righteous for male but for
[2:10] a kingdom and there is also right for a
[2:13] kingdom and from Almighty God he said he
[2:17] looked he looked for man but he could
[2:19] not find any
[2:21] the skull is sick you'll 20 to 29 to 30
[2:34] CQ
[2:40] Vicki or what 22 9:30 he said the people
[2:51] of the land have used a present and
[2:54] exercise robbery and have that's the
[2:57] pool in idiot
[2:58] they have oppress the stranger
[3:00] wrongfully he said and I sought for a
[3:04] man among them that should make up the
[3:06] hedge and stand in the gap before me for
[3:11] the land that I should not destroy it
[3:14] but I could not find any confine none
[3:31] let's go to a wall
[3:37] Genesis 6:5 tree
[3:47] said and God saw that the wickedness of
[3:49] man was great in the earth and that
[3:51] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[3:55] heart was only evil continually and it
[3:58] repented the Lord that he had made a man
[4:00] on earth and grieved him at his heart
[4:03] and the Lord said I will destroy man
[4:07] whom I have created from the face of the
[4:09] earth both man and beast and the
[4:12] creeping thing and the thoughts are
[4:14] there for a repenting me that I have
[4:16] made them but Noah found grace in the
[4:20] eyes of the Lord
[4:31] let's go so there must be a difference
[4:35] between that just being a male and being
[4:38] a man so God is having trouble fun and
[4:43] being a fine and a kingdom man school
[4:47] Isaiah
[4:48] 3
[4:56] verse 12 as for my people children and
[5:02] their oppressors and women rule over
[5:05] them or more people which they left the
[5:08] cause of being to hurt and destroy it
[5:11] the way other paths this is something
[5:15] about the on the children are chaos and
[5:18] women not and the women have to rule you
[5:23] know we're living in and destructive
[5:26] culture now there must be a difference
[5:30] between a male and a female in the book
[5:34] of Genesis when God created Adam he was
[5:38] created in a perfect environment by the
[5:41] perfect by a perfect being let's go to
[5:47] Genesis 1
[5:55] now when God first starts creating his
[5:58] he's God he says and God said let there
[6:03] be light and God God God said that to be
[6:08] this but God said let there be there but
[6:12] when you starts dealing with man and
[6:14] chapter 2 he goes from the God that
[6:21] create anything up you know creates
[6:25] anything out nothing you like to say but
[6:29] in chapter 2 when it started the over
[6:31] the man he's the Lord God you know and
[6:37] percent and said the Lord God formed man
[6:39] of the dust line out of the ground made
[6:45] the Lord the Lord God 15 in the Lord God
[6:48] took the man 18 and the Lord God said if
[6:53] she died admit that man should be alone
[6:54] I will make him a helper and out of the
[6:58] ground the Lord God the Lord God is
[7:00] capital L Ord
[7:14] to be it to be a kingdom man you have to
[7:16] have all that all the virtues of a
[7:18] statute of a perfect man
[7:29] and the kingdom kingdom means ruled of
[7:32] kingship he says you are not a kingdom
[7:36] man unless God is telling you what to do
[7:39] said the problem we have is that
[7:42] independence of man then who don't like
[7:46] to be told what to do we don't want our
[7:49] kids telling us what to do and even if
[7:52] our wives tell us before to do we don't
[7:54] go for it sometimes even if God tells
[7:57] you what to do what to do you don't do
[8:01] it unless you like what God is telling
[8:02] you so the kingdom of God the eternal
[8:11] servant or kingly rule of God manifested
[8:15] and accepted by man on earth and the
[8:18] hope for the future the central theme of
[8:20] Jesus teaching the phrase does not occur
[8:23] in the hope destined but that idea is
[8:26] present in thy kingdom my kingdom
[8:39] we have we had three drivers at
[8:41] waterworks and one driver retired so
[8:44] they kind of saw the driver and they
[8:46] kept looking for him all the time be it
[8:48] was always in the truck token on his
[8:49] horn and stuff like that they could
[8:51] never get him to do anything so the ball
[8:54] says told him one time we don't have any
[8:57] work for you if you want to sweep the
[8:59] warehouse or whatever you can and stay
[9:01] here so he called Brown and the big boss
[9:06] who said does that there's a manager of
[9:09] the warehouse has the authority to tell
[9:11] us to shoot the warehouse guess what he
[9:13] didn't last very long
[9:14] so he didn't want the job so they sent
[9:17] him to do other stuff and they fired
[9:21] because he was always making excuses I
[9:23] don't want to do this you don't want the
[9:28] job
[9:33] as Colonel John 18
[9:45] 33 the third Center
[9:57] then Pilate entered into the judgment
[10:00] Hall again and called jesus said unto
[10:02] Him or thou the King of the Jews
[10:04] jesus answered him saying thus the this
[10:09] think of thyself or did others tell it
[10:11] to be a mean Pilate answer mi-joo
[10:17] domination the chief priests said
[10:19] deliver thee unto me what has God done
[10:23] jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[10:26] world in my kingdom were of this world
[10:28] then would my servants fight that I
[10:30] should not be delivered to the Jews but
[10:33] now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate
[10:37] therefore said unto him although King
[10:40] then jesus answered they say that I am a
[10:43] king to this end was I born and for this
[10:46] cause came unto the world that I should
[10:49] bear witness unto the truth everyone
[10:52] that is the truth pass it
[11:03] and the message perfection brother -
[11:09] brother Graham said Christ verse 4
[11:13] shadow also and Melchizedek in the
[11:15] priesthood in the ninth chapter net 7
[11:19] not in the seventh chapter of Hebrews
[11:22] are the Melchizedek Abraham also
[11:25] foreshadow all that they're all the good
[11:28] thing just a shadow and how that
[11:30] Melchizedek in the seventh chapter read
[11:33] on him here would you read it for a
[11:35] moment for this melts says that a king
[11:38] of Salem priest the Most High God who
[11:42] met Abraham returning from the start of
[11:44] the kings and blessing amen Abraham Lord
[11:49] his cousin had back slate you see that
[11:51] real truth period of Christ he said I
[11:54] hope you get it no matter how far he
[11:57] backs lived when he was in trouble here
[11:59] come Abraham to him with an army
[12:01] the aliens around it about through the
[12:04] bellies of Sodom that come down and took
[12:07] Sodom and his King and it took him there
[12:11] and had to take lot with him my neighbor
[12:14] hummus on cold blood relation brothers
[12:17] children he looked down and saw that the
[12:20] enemy had taken his blood relation he
[12:23] form an army of his own servants went
[12:26] after him that represented Christ when
[12:30] he was the Church of the Living God had
[12:33] been called away in error of the devil
[12:35] the Foreign Legion angel
[12:37] came to the earth to pursue the devil
[12:40] overtook him are they to be a scarer the
[12:43] enemy and will how we love him for that
[12:45] overtook the enemy and he slew the enemy
[12:48] and robbed him of everything he had cast
[12:51] him aside and what was the first thing
[12:54] that they think they did Abraham
[12:56] returning back without his wife his
[12:58] children and all the procession
[13:00] trampling walking back to the old home
[13:02] grounds again he met Melchizedek
[13:05] melchester there was a king of Salem
[13:08] Salem and Jerusalem is Jerusalem when
[13:12] the Jews went into Jerusalem they called
[13:14] Jerusalem Salem which means the city at
[13:17] peace he was the king listen let us read
[13:22] to Abraham gave a tenth part of olive
[13:26] first being interpret the king of
[13:28] righteousness who was that this king
[13:31] they met him come back with a triumphant
[13:33] victory as a church is today from
[13:35] cavalry after that the king of Salem
[13:38] witches came at peace with our father
[13:41] without mother without the Senate they
[13:44] were neither beginning days nor end in
[13:46] our life who is this king of Salem the
[13:49] Great King of Jerusalem not the earthly
[13:52] King the heavenly the earthly Jerusalem
[13:56] is a type of the heaven II here come the
[13:59] king of Salem which is the first king of
[14:02] the Rachna the king of peace he didn't
[14:04] have any father didn't have any mother
[14:06] he didn't have the beginning of him
[14:09] there's been a lot of kings and there is
[14:11] a lot of kings but there's something
[14:13] wrong team there's only room for one
[14:15] King and that's Jesus Christ
[14:30] in the message that seven seal brethren
[14:32] said now they said it was a sword of the
[14:36] king but it said the sword King the
[14:38] sword of the king and there's only one
[14:40] King and that is God and he has one
[14:43] sword that is his work and the message
[14:49] that spoken word is the original seed
[14:52] progress that you can only serve God as
[14:55] you do and believe that sermons and god
[14:58] send
[14:58] you can only serve God on earth as God's
[15:01] servant that sent on earth by divine
[15:04] inspiration interpreted the work to you
[15:08] the message world the world falling
[15:11] apart that's the King that should come
[15:14] to his kingdom someday and his kingdom
[15:16] is not being established in their heart
[15:18] of his people here on earth on the
[15:22] kingdom you guys ain't got farm yet
[15:37] mister of a perfect man that's what I
[15:40] was talking about Kingdom and has that
[15:42] of all this especially yes right ten
[15:45] person you know that brother or sister
[15:48] do you wrong yeah go ahead
[15:50] so you need all these you got a patient
[15:52] you know you're gonna have enough what a
[15:56] brother Brent said if you don't have
[15:57] enough
[15:58] I'll be there stitch of a perfect man
[16:07] God willing a chef
[16:10] statue of the man you're affecting
[16:13] himself into that being perfectly
[16:15] worshipped God enough being his
[16:18] Tabernacle God manifesting how we could
[16:21] stay on that till you almost suffocated
[16:25] in here from the heat notice that God is
[16:28] always at all kinds of reflected in
[16:30] himself in a man and demonology brother
[16:37] Graham said man never didn't keep his
[16:39] covenant with God the law was never kept
[16:42] it couldn't keep the law
[16:44] Christ was calm and broke the law
[16:47] himself because Grace had already
[16:49] provided a savior
[16:51] Moses provided a way of escape and in
[16:54] the escape rather and then the people
[16:57] after that they still wanted something
[16:59] to do
[17:05] in the present state of a ministry man
[17:08] is a failure to begin with he's only an
[17:12] agent through which Scott works through
[17:14] and God works his own will but when you
[17:18] see the super-duper people that's always
[17:21] having this and that and the other you
[17:23] better stay away from them see Jesus
[17:27] himself into the death process and all
[17:33] the things relevant I believe that when
[17:35] God calls a man to service if he's a
[17:38] married man as as the help man he calls
[17:41] it one of the 10 because they are two
[17:43] she should have done it
[17:51] [Applause]
[17:53] questions an answer God is not a woman
[17:57] God is a man there's only one really one
[18:00] that is a man a woman is the byproduct
[18:03] from a man man was not made for her for
[18:08] a woman but woman was made for men see
[18:11] if you just open up your spiritual
[18:16] understanding you see man when man first
[18:20] came on earth he was both male and
[18:22] female feminist and masculine before
[18:25] he'd become sexy a feminine spirit the
[18:28] lower spirit is suit oneness Timothy and
[18:32] then there's also muscular man but when
[18:36] he may then put him into a difference in
[18:40] order to reproduce a world he he brought
[18:43] the feminist spirit out of him and put
[18:47] from him and ripped from his side and
[18:49] made him a female the Revelation chapter
[18:56] 5 he said all nature waiting for his
[19:00] master the master is the son of God it
[19:03] was given to serve now God will have his
[19:05] heaven of course but this is given to
[19:09] the man and the Kings man redeemer come
[19:12] to redeem us back to that we lost when
[19:16] the work is finished we we have all
[19:20] these things again what kind of all
[19:22] things we'll have all power we have all
[19:25] eternal life will have eternal health
[19:28] will have eternal youth will have
[19:30] eternal power or just it eternal with a
[19:34] tournament and then we're all waiting
[19:36] for that time to come
[19:44] Tice tight attire I just say searching
[19:47] 10 kids are okay I'm a because I sake
[19:50] not thyroid if they're and we can look
[20:02] to earth the hem and see the son of man
[20:04] rising from his throne to start to work
[20:07] the earth for the rapture of his church
[20:08] and I know that his precious feet won't
[20:11] touch as a sinful earth as that time for
[20:15] as Rebekah wrote the camel and jumped
[20:17] off the Tamil right between the house of
[20:20] Abraham and until she met her bride
[20:23] Oh God and the church will meet our
[20:26] bride in the air it was bright Malin
[20:46] everlasting life he said when you're
[20:48] staying the kingdom stay in the Gospels
[20:50] stay right one one of these days God
[20:53] will call you out and set you aside add
[20:56] up you and his son before the people and
[20:58] give you as something that will shake
[21:02] the nation with it
[21:11] yeah absolutely brother said God doesn't
[21:14] deal with groups a man God deals with
[21:16] individuals because the man has
[21:18] different ideas he's built up different
[21:21] in nature and God has to take that man
[21:24] and mess him around and pull him Iran
[21:27] out of his own self till he gets him in
[21:29] his nature and God deals with that
[21:33] person
[21:37] [Applause]
[21:45] got hidden and reveal in simplicity the
[21:48] president said a man was made to rely
[21:50] completely upon God that's the reason
[21:52] we're like unto lambs a sheep and sheep
[21:55] cannot lead himself he has to have a
[21:58] leader and that Holy Spirit is supposed
[22:00] to lead us so man is made that way and
[22:03] God made all of his works so simply that
[22:07] the simple couldn't understand it and
[22:09] God had made himself simple with a
[22:11] simple in order to understand by the
[22:14] symbol perfect faith I don't forget this
[22:24] one I might be getting close
[22:27] God uses men and men only
[22:29] God doesn't use machinery God doesn't
[22:32] use crew a man who doesn't use
[22:34] organization the do use of individuals
[22:38] always I'm bailing a God he will hello
[22:47] Henry
[22:48] when God first started creating he was a
[22:50] self assistant tell him you know and
[22:53] then like I said in in chapter 2 and
[22:57] it's there's the Lord guy so then the
[23:00] Lord that you breathe you know that
[23:04] scent you
[23:05] he's also your Lord
[23:10] he was alone am the eternal burning and
[23:12] Hamlisch thought he wanted to become
[23:15] material
[23:16] they do then he spoke the word and the
[23:20] world was materialized that's the whole
[23:22] picture from Genesis to Revelation it's
[23:26] nothing wrong is there lying men met
[23:29] materializing so you could be touched
[23:31] whew and in the Millennium that Elohim
[23:36] said in on the throne that's right with
[23:38] all of the subjects around him that he
[23:40] predestinated before the foundation of
[23:43] the world like a man building shining or
[23:46] making chimes and water which bells got
[23:50] to ring different from the other the
[23:52] same material but so much iron so much
[23:55] still so much pressed to make it give
[23:58] the thing that's the way God did it you
[24:01] breathe this one - that one - this one -
[24:03] that one - this one - that want to be
[24:07] God exactly what he wanted
[24:20] the future home he said potentially the
[24:23] kingdom of God is in earth now in the
[24:26] hearse of his Saints is its attributes
[24:28] that he began in the beginning now his
[24:31] attributes is redeemed
[24:33] what's he waiting to retain the earth to
[24:36] see expects tribute on it to fulfill
[24:39] exactly this bridge predestinated plan
[24:53] things that are to be it is a perfect
[24:56] Kingdom so it might be a perfect people
[24:58] come because you have to stand to be
[25:00] married to a perfect Son of God and you
[25:02] might be a perfect price okay you do it
[25:06] through anything else but the perfect
[25:08] world of God which is the waters of
[25:10] separation that washes us away from sin
[25:13] Amen that's right the father Jesus
[25:15] Christ think of it the drinking blood
[25:17] world amen the blood the word of the God
[25:21] bleeding blood to watch the bride and a
[25:24] man yes sir she stands perfect virgin
[25:27] adulterer and she never seen in the
[25:29] first place amen
[25:30] she was strapped into it any question
[25:39] that I comment by the way too unfinished
[25:42] good part of me because he says surely
[25:44] sometimes we read Genesis 5 verse 1 and
[25:48] 2 Genesis 1 and 2 it goes in with the
[25:57] program
[26:07] yet his his father wanted to oh yeah
[26:13] this is the book of the generation of
[26:15] denim the day that God created man and
[26:17] his likeness and God made him male and
[26:20] female created he them and blessed them
[26:23] and called their name Adam in the day
[26:26] when they were created and Adam lived
[26:31] this book is of the generations of Adam
[26:36] in two generations of Eve I think the
[26:39] duration of generations of me or anybody
[26:41] of the generations of Adam and male and
[26:45] female created he them and blessed them
[26:48] and called their name that alludes to
[26:53] male and female was Adam yeah he was
[26:58] both and then when God separated them
[27:03] the analogy of pulling a rib is just a
[27:11] story he took Eve out of Adam's
[27:16] separated Balaam all right he said we're
[27:20] gonna help man they tell them as long as
[27:25] you don't throw me out here I'm good I
[27:27] thought y'all gonna throw me out okay
[27:32] thank you like I say I'm not for all the
[27:35] way
[27:36] [Music]
