[0:02] now today I just have a little simple
[0:05] lesson
[0:07] on the blood
[0:09] so I wanted to turn to First Corinthians
[0:12] chapter 11.
[0:17] First Corinthians chapter 11. okay
[0:27] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[0:37] chapter 11.
[0:45] and do we have a verse on that yet
[0:48] versus
[0:50] make sure I'm in the frame here 24.
[0:56] and 25.
[1:02] take it easy
[1:05] we ready
[1:07] now one time I heard an old oak tree say
[1:10] that you don't have a right to open the
[1:12] word to first go to the author yes so
[1:14] let's uh let's go to the author real
[1:16] quick Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for
[1:18] your grace to us today to be able to
[1:20] gather around your word my pray Lord
[1:22] that you'll come down I'm going to say
[1:25] open up your word to us so we can get
[1:28] the benefit of it Lord Jesus granted
[1:30] Lord that you'll be here by the way and
[1:31] all the ones that are traveling this
[1:32] morning to do with the service this
[1:34] morning we pray and ask these things in
[1:36] your name amen
[1:38] so
[1:43] um
[1:47] First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 24
[1:50] and 25.
[1:52] say yes and when he had given things
[1:55] break it and said take eat this is my
[2:00] body which is broken for you
[2:02] this dude and the limits of me
[2:05] after the same manner also he took the
[2:08] cup when he had Subs saying this cup is
[2:11] the New Testament in my blood this Duty
[2:14] as often as you drink it and remembrance
[2:18] of me
[2:19] now that's what I want to talk about
[2:21] this morning this cup is the New
[2:22] Testament in my blood a new testament
[2:25] not something that's even greater than
[2:27] what was spoken of in the Old Testament
[2:29] but magnification of all the things that
[2:32] were typed in the Old Testament
[2:35] and
[2:36] you know a lot of times when I when I
[2:39] think about how I look at scripture I
[2:41] like to compare it uh some things about
[2:43] my Approach compare it to maybe what the
[2:46] Catholics believe and how they look at
[2:47] things and kind of make sure that that
[2:49] helps kind of to to to to look at what
[2:53] other people believe I I hope you don't
[2:57] get the wrong impression by that book
[2:59] you know the Catholics look at at the
[3:02] Old Testament and the new test they look
[3:03] at the Old Testament just like the Jews
[3:05] did in Exodus 19 is something to do
[3:07] something some some some laws to to uh
[3:12] that they needed to accomplish to
[3:15] satisfy a requirement from God and then
[3:17] we'll come over to the New Testament and
[3:19] it's another set of laws another set of
[3:21] they look at us something else to do
[3:23] just something else to try to satisfy to
[3:26] try to satiate God's requirement
[3:29] and
[3:30] and it's it's uh if you look at the Old
[3:34] Testament and what it really is what
[3:36] really happened is it is before the
[3:37] foundation of the world God dwelt in
[3:39] that alone Elohim and that Fountain of
[3:42] love with attributes inside of him and
[3:45] those attributes were written in him and
[3:48] his desire was to expose to manifest
[3:51] those attributes and write them write
[3:53] them uh all down through the ages in
[3:56] different ways and different times
[3:58] first he began to manifest those
[4:00] attributes and his son and out of that
[4:03] out of that Fountain of Love Came to
[4:04] logos then out of that logos came in
[4:07] Genesis 1 26 27 and those attributes
[4:10] began to be written down and written and
[4:12] then he he began to write this story of
[4:15] his attributes in the stars and uh the
[4:19] early Believers in Adam and Eve and and
[4:22] then on down to Abel and uh through the
[4:25] linears they they could look before it
[4:27] was even written in the word they could
[4:29] look up into the Stars
[4:32] and see
[4:35] blessing
[4:39] to see God's word began to be written
[4:43] the whole Redemption story
[4:48] and in the Stars we we looked at before
[4:50] of how you could see that that what was
[4:53] within what was inside of God those
[4:56] attributes of a redeemer a savior uh a
[4:59] Healer they began God put those in the
[5:01] Stars so that they could look up and see
[5:03] and then one day he wrote the in the Old
[5:06] Testament he threw Moses he began to
[5:09] write those first five books of the
[5:11] Bible and through job and all the all
[5:13] the Patriarchs now the question is how
[5:16] did the Bible how was the Bible written
[5:18] was it just written by somebody got an
[5:21] idea or something it was written through
[5:23] the lives lived live and lived that's
[5:26] how the Bible is written they lived a
[5:29] life and then that life that was lived
[5:31] was written so that we could read it and
[5:34] understand what was written in Christ
[5:36] what was written in God before the
[5:38] foundation of the world
[5:45] now
[5:47] so there's there's the Old Testament
[5:50] that God before the foundation the world
[5:52] wanted to write write down what was in
[5:55] him and in the Old Testament scripture
[5:57] we began to see that great plan of God
[5:59] which was not just to manifest himself
[6:02] in his son but to manifest himself in
[6:04] the flesh of his people and all down
[6:07] through the Old Testament that was the
[6:09] story was told
[6:10] until we get to the New Testament and
[6:13] this in the New Testament the story is
[6:15] is magnified because now God can come
[6:18] and put that life that was that was
[6:20] written before the foundation of the
[6:21] world he can put that same life in us
[6:23] and that's the New Testament now
[6:27] if uh what a testament is is it it's a
[6:31] covenant it's the evidence of an event
[6:34] it's the evidence if I want to see uh
[6:37] like if if I had a relative that was
[6:39] that died and they left me a lot of
[6:41] things I I want to see you know you go
[6:44] before the lawyer or whatever the court
[6:45] and they'd say well uh this person left
[6:48] you a fortune a million dollars or
[6:51] whatever it might be and and there might
[6:54] be some people that would maybe argue
[6:56] about that say well I don't believe that
[6:59] you got that you'd say well give me the
[7:02] evidence I want to see the evidence of
[7:05] what was written of what I have and it
[7:09] so I want to impress upon you if you
[7:12] have the opportunity now to take this
[7:15] what this uh the evidence of what you
[7:18] have of what you own
[7:20] it's we should all desire in our in our
[7:23] heart and our lives to seek out what's
[7:26] to review what's
[7:28] what God has has what was written in God
[7:32] before the financial world that we now
[7:34] can possess right and uh you know
[7:37] brother Dale last night in the Bible
[7:39] study was talking about at the uh the
[7:41] Jubilee year and the
[7:43] um uh the 49s and the 50 and you know
[7:46] when they came to that 50th year they
[7:48] got everything that they all need the
[7:51] whole position went back to them they
[7:54] were able to take everything
[7:56] if you go to the Bible and say well is
[7:59] I'm not sure this is I feel like this is
[8:02] sometimes what we do is we'll go read
[8:05] scriptures about healing and say I can
[8:08] see it in the scripture but I'm not 100
[8:10] sure that it's for me I believe it is
[8:13] for brother Joe I believe it's for uh
[8:15] sister Becca
[8:16] but when you can see in the scripture
[8:18] that it is for you and make it personal
[8:21] that that attribute in God is written
[8:24] here and now I can I I can take
[8:26] possession of that because it's written
[8:28] in this word and it's mine
[8:30] amen no amen
[8:33] and uh you know another reason that I
[8:36] believe we should we should I I I'm a
[8:39] big believer in personal study of God's
[8:41] word is it don't just take um
[8:45] there was a little kitty show that when
[8:48] I was in school called Reading Rainbow
[8:50] and the guy that did that he would say
[8:52] Don't just take my word for it and I I
[8:55] don't want you just take my own word for
[8:57] it when I tell you what's in God's word
[8:58] go back and search it out and prove it
[9:01] and Paul even told us in Galatians 1 8
[9:03] he said
[9:04] though we or an angel from heaven preach
[9:06] any other gospel unto you than that
[9:08] which we have preached unto you let him
[9:09] be accursed so how do you know if I am
[9:13] preaching to you what's written in the
[9:14] Bible unless you go search it out for
[9:16] yourself and prove that it's really
[9:18] written the way that I'm presenting it
[9:20] and I it doesn't bother me at all if you
[9:24] come in and challenge me and ask me
[9:27] questions is this really show me the
[9:29] quote show me the scripture because
[9:32] uh our our souls are in the balance our
[9:34] our lives are in the balance and we
[9:37] should all be uh be diligent to to a
[9:41] desire to seek out what's written in the
[9:43] coming in the will for us
[9:46] and uh you know the a testament is an
[9:49] Evidence and I I was looking at how
[9:51] job's in job's life how he said
[9:55] her Adventure any of my family has done
[9:58] anything wrong that I will offer a
[10:00] sacrifice and the in the Old Testament
[10:03] their evidence was that blood sprinkled
[10:06] over the limb of the door or when they
[10:08] put their hand on that offering and cut
[10:09] the throat of that animal and that blood
[10:11] just spattered all over them and they
[10:13] were just covered in that blood you know
[10:14] they go before the priest and put their
[10:16] hand over it and there was blood
[10:18] everywhere and they could look at that
[10:19] and say I have done I have met every
[10:22] requirement I have done exactly what God
[10:25] asked
[10:26] now you say
[10:28] God gave us an unconditional Covenant
[10:30] that we don't have to do anything but
[10:32] Abel did still have to go
[10:34] and offer the sacrifice
[10:37] we used to in this day you still have to
[10:39] believe you have to believe you don't
[10:41] have to you don't have to offer Novena
[10:43] you don't have to pay the priest a bunch
[10:44] of money you don't have to do anything
[10:45] of yourself you don't have to go work at
[10:47] the soup kitchen but you have to believe
[10:49] God's word
[10:50] and you have to stand upon his God on
[10:52] his word and that's what job did he he
[10:54] brought his sacrifice and he said now I
[10:57] have done everything that God requires
[10:59] and and then maybe a week later uh maybe
[11:03] they did something else maybe my
[11:04] children did something else and he would
[11:06] go and offer another sacrifice per
[11:08] Adventure they have they have done
[11:10] something wrong and he knew that that
[11:12] blood covered over all the sins now
[11:15] that's a question uh maybe uh maybe in
[11:19] some of our Arts is does the blood take
[11:22] care of all of our sins all of our all
[11:25] of our troubles
[11:27] all of our uh I mean you know we have
[11:29] troubles in this life and everything but
[11:30] the the blood of Jesus Christ is
[11:34] powerful There Is Power in the Blood and
[11:38] I I wonder sometimes maybe if we just
[11:40] really realize how much power to wash
[11:44] away all of our sins to change our lives
[11:46] to give us heat how what what is all
[11:49] what is in the blood what is in the
[11:51] blood is that new testament Covenant the
[11:54] life that was in the blood in the Old
[11:56] Testament it was just the chemistry they
[11:57] had that blood splattered upon them and
[11:59] that life that was in the blood can
[12:00] never come back upon the believer but
[12:03] now in the New Testament the life that
[12:04] was in Christ can come back into
[12:06] believer and make them a new creature in
[12:09] Christ Jesus
[12:11] now you can't have
[12:14] you can't in the Old Testament
[12:16] you know there had to be a substitute
[12:19] there had to be something to substitute
[12:21] and that's because God is a just God he
[12:23] won't just throw out what you have done
[12:26] and you know that would uh
[12:29] nice example I I used before if you came
[12:31] before the judge and and a long list of
[12:34] things that you have done wrong or just
[12:35] sin or even if you've never done
[12:37] anything wrong the fact that you had
[12:38] been born wrong in the first place born
[12:40] and shaped and born and said shape to an
[12:42] equal to spouse from your mother wounds
[12:44] thinking lies you come into the world
[12:46] like that and just that one block on the
[12:48] record is enough to separate me from God
[12:51] so if you come before God and he just
[12:53] puts that in the Trashy then somebody
[12:57] could go to the trash Heap and get that
[12:59] out of the Trashy and pull it up but the
[13:02] blood of God is powerful enough to block
[13:04] that completely out so you can't go to
[13:07] the trash Heap and pull it up now when
[13:09] we say uh you know I I think maybe when
[13:13] you picture in your mind that God puts
[13:15] your sins in the sea of his
[13:16] forgetfulness that we think it's
[13:18] somewhere maybe we think somewhere that
[13:21] you can go and pull it out again now
[13:24] that's what is the Sea of God
[13:26] forgiveness and you know brother Brown
[13:27] told us exactly what the Sea of God
[13:31] that quote
[13:33] uh just bear with me for a second yes
[13:37] um
[13:38] now
[13:45] made a comment that if something's in
[13:48] that please
[13:49] and and say something
[13:52] that that is on them now if they bring
[13:56] it up and like talk you know
[13:59] or whatever I I haven't read but I'm I'm
[14:02] sure it's
[14:03] not sure
[14:05] so
[14:16] um
[14:17] I I can't speak on that right now but
[14:20] that's good
[14:22] now
[14:24] sure because because what God has done
[14:28] he blocks out your sins by putting your
[14:31] sin in that sea of forgiveness and what
[14:33] happens when it's in the sea of forgive
[14:35] us
[14:36] now here's a here's a quote I want to
[14:38] read Investments
[14:40] 1963 0803b
[14:45] notice when this your sins are confessed
[14:47] and your sins are dropped into the
[14:49] bleeps of the blood of the Son of God it
[14:51] remains sins so much that it's it's put
[14:54] in the sea of God's forgiveness and can
[14:57] never even be remembered in his cycle
[14:59] then what that does that make a man a
[15:02] Son of God never
[15:04] then then what that does that make a man
[15:07] a son of God
[15:09] never remembers you to be a sinner you
[15:12] are a son you are a daughter there's no
[15:14] more remembrance of sin it all God puts
[15:17] it in the sea of forgetfulness the
[15:19] bleach
[15:20] so what's to see a forgiveness the sea
[15:23] of forgetfulness is Christ's blood that
[15:26] will shed for you
[15:28] and therefore then you and God are
[15:30] Father and Son by Jesus Christ's Grace
[15:32] not by anything you've done but by his
[15:35] grace you are Sons and Daughters of God
[15:37] you're going to take care of his
[15:39] blessings and of his power and of his
[15:41] life
[15:46] the bleeds of God's blood
[15:49] when you put that dark stain of your sin
[15:51] and that Bleach then that bleed your
[15:53] bleeds will you know take a just tear
[15:55] apart on a molecular level all of the
[15:58] things until you can't find it anymore
[15:59] and brother Brandon talked about how
[16:01] when people would come before him that
[16:03] God would not show him things that they
[16:05] that were under the blood that they have
[16:07] confessed and asked forgiveness for
[16:08] because God it was in God's sea of
[16:11] forgetfulness the blood that was in
[16:13] there it was it was gone it was
[16:15] annihilated and think about how how
[16:18] glorious that is just uh
[16:23] all of the all of the problems all of
[16:26] the uh things that we've done in life
[16:28] and just aside from that just being born
[16:32] wrong which is the the biggest Mark that
[16:34] we all had in our life and
[16:37] so the blood of Jesus Christ annihilates
[16:40] uh annihilates sin and that that uh
[16:43] that's what brings you to Perfection to
[16:46] a perfect place in your soul because it
[16:49] destroys Sin from your soul your soul
[16:53] when you receive the new birth
[16:56] there's no more unbelief in your soul
[16:58] because you're at that place where God
[17:00] gives you your faith his faith and it
[17:02] becomes a possession of that bottom of
[17:04] the Statue of a perfect man that God's
[17:06] faith comes in you and now you can
[17:08] believe and you're that that Mark that
[17:10] was against you that began in the Garden
[17:12] of Eden when Adam and Eve took something
[17:15] else aside from the revealed word of God
[17:18] and added added a little bit to it or
[17:20] took it took some out then that Mark is
[17:23] annihilated because you become a perfect
[17:26] a perfect creation of Christ Jesus
[17:29] and for him will I accept in 1952 he
[17:33] when you confess a sin he puts it in the
[17:35] sea of forgetfulness to remember it
[17:37] against you no more it's just did you
[17:39] know what this bleach is that you use
[17:41] for your washing Clorox whatever What It
[17:43] Is Well you take just one drop of ink
[17:46] and drop it into that tub of blood what
[17:48] would happen to that drop of ink you
[17:50] couldn't find it could you it would just
[17:52] it would just be bleach is that right
[17:54] well that's the way Sim does when he
[17:56] hits the blood of Jesus Christ it's just
[17:57] no more he don't know what happens to it
[18:00] it's you couldn't get it out of there if
[18:02] you had to anymore she's just done
[18:04] that's right color there's color or
[18:06] black ink but it ain't black no more see
[18:08] it's gone the black has become White and
[18:11] the black is going somewhere and you
[18:13] don't know where it's went
[18:15] is that is is that right that's the way
[18:17] sin is
[18:21] and Micah that that the scripture where
[18:23] the seed of forgetfulness is it doesn't
[18:25] say in the Bible see the Forgiveness but
[18:28] in Micah chapter 7 verse 19 he says he
[18:30] will turn again he will have compassion
[18:33] upon us he will subdue our iniquities
[18:36] and now we'll cast all their sins into
[18:39] the depths of the sea
[18:41] now so we're talking about the blood in
[18:44] the New Testament in his blood in the
[18:46] New Testament you know brother Dale
[18:48] always preaches or teaches on where did
[18:50] the New Testament begin now if you read
[18:53] through the through the scriptures you
[18:54] come to a division of scriptures a
[18:57] division of uh you know if somebody said
[18:59] turn to the New Testament of course
[19:01] you're going to turn to Matthew because
[19:02] that is a division of scriptures where
[19:04] the body of text begins at Matthew but
[19:08] the New Testament in it is in his blood
[19:10] it is the life in his blood and that's
[19:12] why the New Testament didn't begin until
[19:15] the day of Pentecost when they had a
[19:18] life that was in him the the attributes
[19:21] that were in him before the foundation
[19:23] of the world began to be written in men
[19:25] and they became written Epistles known
[19:27] and read of all men because those
[19:29] attributes began to be written in people
[19:33] and uh so I think about the scene of the
[19:37] crucifixion and I it came to mind that
[19:40] that song that the old slaves used to
[19:43] sing Were You There When They Crucified
[19:46] My Lord and I wonder if they even knew
[19:49] what they were really seeing and you
[19:51] know what brand of pretty so many
[19:52] sermons about being identified in Christ
[19:54] and how we were in him when he died on
[19:57] the cross and that's a very touchy thing
[20:00] to preach on because many many preached
[20:03] that you were there like the Mormons
[20:04] believed that you were actually
[20:06] physically there like watching the scene
[20:09] and back there you were observing the
[20:11] scene but what was there what was
[20:13] predestinated before the foundation of
[20:15] the world was God's attribute got the
[20:18] word in the beginning was the word and
[20:21] the Word was made flesh so that the word
[20:24] could be made flesh in Us in the
[20:26] beginning was the word and that word is
[20:29] what is predestinated God never said I'm
[20:31] gonna I'm Gonna Save uh Joe and not
[20:34] sister because just as just an example
[20:36] just throwing eggs out but he said I am
[20:39] going to predestinate myself my word and
[20:43] if you in this day if you believe me if
[20:46] you uh one day when you accept it when
[20:48] you're filled with the Holy Ghost that
[20:50] word that was there before the
[20:51] foundation of the world comes alive and
[20:53] you and that is what the New Testament
[20:55] is what was written before the
[20:57] foundation of the world living In the
[20:58] Flesh of the Believers today
[21:00] okay
[21:02] and uh God's only provided a place of
[21:04] worship in 1965 uh brother Brown said
[21:07] Moses was in him
[21:10] Joshua was in him
[21:12] and if you are in him
[21:14] you was in him before the foundation of
[21:17] the world the family of God you suffered
[21:19] with him you died with him you went to
[21:22] the cross with him you raised with him
[21:23] and now you're still with him sitting in
[21:26] Heavenly places reflecting the message
[21:28] of the age to the world the light of the
[21:31] world how could you be in him because
[21:32] the life that was in him is now in you
[21:36] and that life never had a beginning and
[21:38] will never had it had an ending in my
[21:41] life by itself without the new birth
[21:43] would have an ending but because his
[21:45] life has come and lived in me it is
[21:48] alive in me now I am part of a a God's
[21:52] Eternal plan part of his eternal life
[21:54] that Eternal Word that was written
[21:56] before the foundation of the world and
[21:58] what was written in now can be made
[22:00] manifest and be written in me
[22:03] yeah
[22:04] and uh
[22:06] so
[22:08] what does the New Testament do
[22:11] the New Testament is all about God being
[22:15] made manifest in flesh
[22:17] and uh that's why this communion
[22:20] scripture is so important all down
[22:24] through scripture that's why Phineas uh
[22:27] was so upset when that doctrine of
[22:30] Balaam came into the camp and the people
[22:32] that should have been that were
[22:34] professing that they were real true
[22:36] believers they said we believe the
[22:38] message of the hour and then they went
[22:40] in the tent and took that false Doctrine
[22:43] took grabbed a hold of that false
[22:45] Doctrine and got away from the real too
[22:46] True Word of God just like they did in
[22:49] the Garden of Eden and Phineas rose up
[22:51] and said I can't stand it they're
[22:53] they're they're saying now take that
[22:56] over to the day they're saying that
[22:57] they're Christians they're saying that
[22:59] they believe the message of the hour but
[23:01] they're denying the power of God they're
[23:03] denying what Paul preached they're
[23:06] denying what by the real priest
[23:09] yeah
[23:10] that's why that's what uh the That's
[23:13] What's So Scary About the community
[23:15] scriptures because if you say that the
[23:18] word those attributes that were in God
[23:20] before the foundation of the world if
[23:21] you late in the confession that that
[23:22] life is living in you and you make that
[23:25] confession before your church and then
[23:26] you go and take communion then you're a
[23:29] drinking damnation to yourself uh you're
[23:31] drinking yourself your body into
[23:33] sickness and things because you're not
[23:35] Discerning the body of God that you're
[23:37] not Discerning the New Testament that
[23:39] God has made manifest that that whole
[23:42] point of the New Testament is for God to
[23:44] be made manifest in his people
[23:52] so
[24:00] we look at at what Jesus did with the
[24:03] blood and and I wonder
[24:06] how often we wonder
[24:09] are all of these promises for me
[24:13] I was going to segue right into healing
[24:16] a little bit because
[24:18] I I was thinking the thought when you
[24:21] look at Salvation
[24:23] does God make a difference did God in
[24:26] the Old Testament when when someone came
[24:28] for salvation
[24:29] did he make
[24:31] the difference between a sick Gentile
[24:34] and a sick Jew
[24:38] is there a difference is that is that
[24:40] what your salvation is based upon by
[24:42] your flesh by your your uh by how good
[24:46] you are or by your your natural language
[24:51] stand up
[24:53] that's why I believe that even Cain
[24:56] himself if he would have accepted the
[24:58] blood sacrifice
[25:00] that the blood and the looking down
[25:01] through time two thousand years that the
[25:03] blood sacrifice
[25:05] is more than able to cleanse even canes
[25:10] even that sins who came and I have a
[25:13] quote from brother Brandon where he said
[25:14] that
[25:16] and uh
[25:18] so I'm about to run out of time
[25:22] talk fast so the question
[25:25] ask for continuation
[25:27] the question is what is the difference
[25:30] to God between a sick Gentile and a sick
[25:33] Jew what is the difference between
[25:35] someone that maybe came from just a
[25:39] horrible image where your mother and
[25:42] your father were out in sin uh just
[25:45] doing things uh and you know all down
[25:47] through the pro the Old Testament you
[25:48] had prostitutes uh David came from uh
[25:51] the lineage of prostitute and uh
[25:55] so I I don't believe
[25:58] that God if if and even in the New
[26:01] Testament when the uh uh
[26:05] uh
[26:06] um
[26:07] drawing a blank where she was from but
[26:09] Jesus called her a dog and because she
[26:13] was a gentile and uh
[26:17] but if if someone is sick or needy
[26:21] spiritually comes to God then God the
[26:24] blood of Jesus Christ is more than able
[26:26] to atone for any problems anything in
[26:29] their life and and God hiding himself in
[26:32] Simplicity in 1963 brother Randall said
[26:35] God is able of these stones
[26:37] said John to rise children to Abraham
[26:40] don't think you're God's children
[26:42] because you're born a Jew
[26:45] and don't think you can't be God's child
[26:48] because you're born a certain way or
[26:50] don't have a certain lineage to be proud
[26:51] of and don't have this and that because
[26:53] the blood of Jesus Christ can can uh it
[26:56] can fix all of that
[26:59] and uh marriage and divorce 1965 you can
[27:03] take the ordinance onerous woman in the
[27:05] town the worst man if they had a baby it
[27:07] would have to come from the Lord
[27:10] because God has lost it together and
[27:12] these laws like the sun to raise you put
[27:15] a cockle bird in a good field will grow
[27:16] and it has to grow because it's God's
[27:18] law what seed is planted it must grow
[27:20] and nothing can grow life but God
[27:22] because it operates under his laws
[27:24] therefore when the evil seed was planned
[27:26] in the womb of Eve it had to bring forth
[27:28] because it's God's law of production and
[27:30] it could do nothing else but bring it
[27:32] and it had to come from God that's the
[27:33] reason that people say little babies
[27:35] sometimes that's not born with Christian
[27:37] parents are lost isn't that terrible
[27:41] Jesus Christ blood a tones for the child
[27:44] I don't care how much it was born and
[27:46] how evil it was born he is the Lamb of
[27:48] God that takes away the sin of the world
[27:49] the little child cannot repent because
[27:53] it has nothing to repent for and that
[27:54] was the sin of the world which was taken
[27:56] away by the blood of Christ babies go to
[27:59] him now if God can do that for a little
[28:01] baby what about when it grows up and
[28:03] wants to turn his life over to God it
[28:06] don't matter where it came from and I
[28:08] think that's I'm gonna stop right there
[28:09] but I think that's just the most
[28:11] beautiful thing about God's the power of
[28:13] God's blood it's more powerful than
[28:15] maybe we think sometimes
