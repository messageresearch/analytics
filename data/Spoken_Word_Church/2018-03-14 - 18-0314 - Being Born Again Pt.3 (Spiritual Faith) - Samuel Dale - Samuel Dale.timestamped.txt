[5:17] we thank you for that and now just
[5:19] deliver us completely and help us to
[5:22] walk in you we love you we thank in
[5:24] Jesus name Amen
[5:27] okay
[5:30] first Peter 1:18 for as far as much as
[5:38] you know that you were not redeemed with
[5:40] corruptible things as silver and gold
[5:43] from there your vain conversation
[5:45] received by tradition from your father's
[5:48] when I read that scripture you might not
[5:50] think about the way that I do what I
[5:53] think like for as much you know that we
[5:55] were redeemed from the corruptible
[5:58] things as silver and gold and all the
[6:00] Vanka and thus don't bring it on over
[6:03] into a new testament part and try to
[6:06] make tongues as the evidence i shouted i
[6:10] cried i spoke in tongues the trying to
[6:13] make it something like that I mean
[6:15] that's the way I think and I'm sorry I
[6:17] just put out what I think okay but what
[6:21] our view but with the precious blood of
[6:23] Christ as of a lamb without blemish and
[6:25] without spot Hoover Li was foreordained
[6:28] before the foundation of the world but
[6:31] was manifest in these life's times for
[6:34] you who by him do believe in God now
[6:38] it's only by him now we're gonna get
[6:40] into it after a while we'll talk about
[6:42] how that your faith becomes his faith
[6:45] and only is it worth anything okay who
[6:50] by him to believe in God that raised him
[6:54] up from the dead and gave him glory that
[6:57] your faith and hope might be in God
[6:59] seeing you have purified your souls and
[7:02] obeying the truth through the spirit
[7:03] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[7:06] that you love one another with a pure
[7:08] heart fervently being born again not a
[7:11] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[7:15] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[7:17] forever now that scripture has a
[7:20] two-fold meaning it means being born
[7:23] again you are you know you your being
[7:26] won't you come into the new birth all
[7:28] right but then you grow in the growth
[7:30] development of a movement of being born
[7:33] again okay now let's go to 2nd Peter 1
[7:38] Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus
[7:41] Christ to them that have obtained
[7:44] like precious faith with us through the
[7:46] righteousness of God and our Savior
[7:48] Jesus Christ
[7:50] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[7:52] through the knowledge of him as to the
[7:55] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[7:57] according as his divine power watch now
[8:00] hath given unto us all things that
[8:03] pertain unto life and godliness how
[8:07] through the knowledge of him that have
[8:10] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[8:15] are given unto us exceeding great and
[8:16] precious promises brother Brennan said
[8:18] these promises all right that by these
[8:21] you might be partakers of the divine
[8:24] nature having escaped the corruption
[8:26] that is in the world through lust
[8:28] wonderful people written to now watch
[8:30] and beside this giving all diligence add
[8:33] to your faith virtue and to virtue
[8:36] knowledge you may be seated the Lord
[8:39] that is blessing as I've always said to
[8:42] you it says add to your faith
[8:45] it doesn't say add to your knowledge add
[8:48] to this or that is always the faith all
[8:52] right now we've come up to a position
[8:54] and I'm going to express something here
[9:00] for a few minutes to let you know where
[9:03] I stand what I believe and I believe the
[9:06] Bible will back it up and I believe the
[9:09] prophets message will verify it but
[9:12] there are so much as the Prophet we gave
[9:15] you where he said you know he said the
[9:18] Holy Ghost is so been missed out huh see
[9:24] and everybody's got this kind of a Holy
[9:25] Ghost got this kind of hold ago you got
[9:27] this new birth you've got that
[9:29] born-again experience you've got all
[9:31] kind of things in the religious realm of
[9:34] mankind and having those things it has
[9:39] produced a lot of things I remember even
[9:42] in this message in the early years
[9:44] sitting and listening to ministers try
[9:47] to explain how they was a difference in
[9:49] the kingdom of God in the kingdom of
[9:53] heaven you know and just
[9:56] running is so great people their glory
[9:58] that would just look at that difference
[10:00] I just don't see any difference you know
[10:03] I just didn't and that's why Vall said
[10:06] to you I always told it to you
[10:08] I believe in three stages phases the
[10:14] Prophet said Oh grace justification
[10:20] repenting of your sins sanctification
[10:23] cleanse and set aside and the baptism of
[10:27] the Holy Ghost to give you the new birth
[10:29] all right now you don't get the new
[10:32] birth that justification you're not born
[10:35] again at justification you get when you
[10:38] come to the new birth is when you come
[10:41] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[10:43] is to say I am born again I've taught
[10:48] you that from the beginning
[10:49] I believe the born-again experience the
[10:52] new birth and the baptism of the Holy
[10:55] Ghost is one of the signs you said well
[10:58] I'll break it down this way we'll let
[10:59] you break it down all you want to I just
[11:01] stay with what I am and the way I stand
[11:06] all right so it's been so missed talked
[11:09] and brother Brennan said there was 900
[11:12] different ways of the denomination
[11:15] seeing it and I've always said there's
[11:17] probably a thousand the way the people
[11:18] of this message you seen it because
[11:20] there was a big doctrine back years ago
[11:23] and it was labeled as the no Holy Ghost
[11:26] doctrine all right in that hold it no
[11:30] Holy Ghost doctrine what they taught was
[11:32] that you got to come all the way up to
[11:36] where it says Holy Spirit before you're
[11:38] even born again now that was the way
[11:42] they taught it a lot of you heard it
[11:46] all right but I'm just saying it that
[11:49] way
[11:50] that that's what it is that they've told
[11:52] it that way all right now a church
[11:56] without a doctrine is not a church
[12:00] all right out I've always contended as I
[12:04] said that it takes justification
[12:06] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[12:08] Ghost to be the new birth all right
[12:10] no that's as simple as I can make it
[12:13] okay now then I've always believed then
[12:17] that after when I heard the prophets
[12:19] message and then I heard the doctrines
[12:22] contrary to it as we will read a lot -
[12:26] not from the Richardson why didn't you
[12:29] just print the whole book the statue of
[12:30] a perfect man we've done a pretty good
[12:32] job in and holding it all right but now
[12:36] listen I believe the prophets message
[12:41] and the Bible teaches that you're born
[12:45] again I'm gonna put it all out and then
[12:47] we'll come back by you're born again at
[12:49] faith all right so then you've got
[12:53] justification you're not in the body you
[12:56] got sanctification you're not in the
[12:58] body then you come to faith and you're
[13:01] in the body
[13:02] anybody that studied pyramidology Zoar
[13:04] anything if you want one I've got a book
[13:06] at home that will show you down below
[13:09] this bottom line is like two things and
[13:12] one of them is called the upside down
[13:15] chamber so anything down below there's
[13:18] all out of theater all right I believe
[13:21] that the Bible the prophet and
[13:22] everything teaches that we're born again
[13:24] at faith and then by the opening of the
[13:28] word will bring us to the position to
[13:32] where it says the Holy Spirit all right
[13:35] and that's where I've told you that
[13:37] under there Pentecost
[13:39] there was a split condition that
[13:41] happened on the day of Pentecost 120 in
[13:45] the Upper Room received the Holy Spirit
[13:47] brother Branham says statue of a perfect
[13:50] man the disciples had these virtues he
[13:54] said they didn't have the headstone but
[13:56] they had two virtues all right where
[13:58] were they at right here born-again Holy
[14:01] Spirit these virtues why because they'd
[14:04] been tutored and trained for three and a
[14:06] half years all right but see then the
[14:10] 3000 outside only heard one message they
[14:14] had no teaching no basics all right so
[14:18] when the Holy Ghost fell it gave them
[14:20] the new birth but it didn't put them up
[14:23] here where the fathers were that it put
[14:25] him here at faith the new birth you're
[14:29] gonna say they didn't get the new birth
[14:32] you in that safe if you do because
[14:34] you're gonna destroy your old Bible and
[14:37] that's why I've always say it in that
[14:40] way you can understand brother Branham
[14:42] retrun said I've met people that had the
[14:45] baptism with the Holy Ghost just like
[14:48] the day of Pentecost before he ever come
[14:51] on the scene see the ones that are
[14:54] saying no Holy Ghost doctrine they say
[14:57] that's incorrect
[14:58] it's you're you're all out of caters and
[15:01] all that they say you got to turn your
[15:03] pyramid upside down because you got to
[15:05] put the Holy Spirit they just don't
[15:08] understand being born again they don't
[15:11] understand the message the Prophet
[15:12] brought of adoption adoption is what
[15:17] born into the family but your tutor
[15:22] training and thing starts when you're
[15:24] born again and you come to the stature
[15:29] of a perfect man all right now that's
[15:32] that's what I say now at least tell you
[15:36] what I believe ain't go Peter Pan around
[15:39] you well yeah yeah oh yeah that was
[15:41] where I'm nobody and now I believe that
[15:44] no I don't know you're gonna hear it one
[15:46] line if you don't like it that's up to
[15:50] you I have no problems
[15:52] I've discussed this and lamps with
[15:56] people to try to get an understanding No
[16:00] and I believe it I believe that the
[16:04] three thousand outside received the
[16:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth
[16:10] born into the body of Christ but he did
[16:14] not put him where the apostles were he
[16:18] put him right down here at the new birth
[16:21] huh
[16:22] now when we read the scripture called we
[16:25] read it here but a run says Peter was
[16:28] saying I have this faith and I'm
[16:31] addressing this to them that have the
[16:34] like precious faith and I gave you a
[16:37] bunch of quotes our Sunday about the I
[16:41] believe it was Sunday wouldn't everyone
[16:43] anyhow were run around used like twenty
[16:45] six times where he spoke of like
[16:47] precious faith and talking about it
[16:50] being the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:51] you know of like precious faith he said
[16:55] Timothy had like precious faith he said
[16:57] Perry green and like precious faith come
[17:00] to Tucson to started the church he puts
[17:03] the like precious faith no so then what
[17:06] we're doing see by reading it this is
[17:10] not written we're going to quote these
[17:11] in a minute we're gonna read them this
[17:14] second Peter is not written to the world
[17:17] now first Peters not the Bible is not
[17:23] written to the world it is written that
[17:26] they can that mankind can read it and
[17:30] become under conviction but it's written
[17:37] to those that are in Christ Jesus who
[17:41] have the new birth all right see that's
[17:45] why they couldn't understand brother
[17:46] Branham he said that's where you
[17:48] Pentecostals failed
[17:50] he says you're born again and he said
[17:53] you thought you got everything he said
[17:55] you just got to the stage of starting
[17:58] that's why they couldn't follow him
[18:00] that's why they can't read the statue of
[18:02] a perfect man the people of this message
[18:06] that's that's message has been argued
[18:10] over and over one plate this way one
[18:13] believes that way one
[18:14] I don't want message but I don't
[18:17] understand I don't understand mankind
[18:20] and they're doing I understand we are
[18:23] humans and I understand that until all
[18:29] you know until we get the faith of God
[18:34] we're in bad shape I ran this off
[18:38] brother branham said have faith in God
[18:44] how many times you think he said down
[18:49] 1017 times he said the quote have faith
[18:57] in God I thank you much to meant what he
[19:04] said don't you alright now let's get on
[19:08] the end result and pick up so you
[19:10] understand what I'm saying now I believe
[19:14] you're born again at faith right here
[19:18] your justification and sanctification is
[19:21] below the pyramid you come up to faith
[19:23] and then virtue or knowledge temperance
[19:26] place of godliness brotherly kindness
[19:27] and where it said the Holy Spirit that's
[19:30] just the faith of the father's because
[19:32] brother Branham said it now you you
[19:37] won't it we couldn't get him to pull up
[19:38] in there they can run it off for you in
[19:40] a hurry to find out he said the
[19:44] headstone has not come yet
[19:47] the disciples never got the headstone
[19:51] they got to faith of the fathers but
[19:54] they never got to hit stone show me in
[19:57] the prophets message that they ever got
[19:59] that well they got the Holy Ghost that's
[20:01] true
[20:02] but they've more to the Holy Ghost than
[20:04] just say old it goes
[20:07] there's a growth development that has
[20:10] been missed by mankind that was in the
[20:13] Bible that was there with the Apostles
[20:15] in sight and the Prophet talked that as
[20:18] I said to you he didn't just start
[20:20] teaching these things in the you know in
[20:23] the sixties
[20:25] he's mentions adoption in 19 and 50 he
[20:31] goes to here you him on adoption in 55
[20:35] I've asked you to read the messages
[20:39] Intervale or however you know the
[20:43] messages that gave you some messages to
[20:45] listen to that you can see back dire
[20:49] that he was teaching back there the fact
[20:53] that mankind needed a growth development
[20:55] not to be satisfied that's where he
[20:57] preached the whole message where Peter
[21:00] calls failed there's a whole message of
[21:03] that and that message was to describe to
[21:07] them where they had missed it he said
[21:11] yes born into the family we see I've
[21:17] been growing I've been growing haven't
[21:24] you
[21:24] I've done a lot of this way I thank
[21:28] after 50 years of the Prophet leaving
[21:32] the scene
[21:34] if you don't know more today then you
[21:38] knew when he was here then the altar is
[21:43] open you need the new birth now I was
[21:49] looking at a quote that brother Branham
[21:51] said to something like this cause this
[21:53] was kind of the way brother Perry grant
[21:54] my brother Henry Green said it God
[21:58] started his church the way he wanted it
[22:01] he wants his church the way he started
[22:06] right he started his people what has
[22:11] been the foundation for this whole
[22:12] message
[22:13] he started with Adam and Eve and
[22:16] according to the message blasphemous
[22:18] name he
[22:20] gave into the nostrils of Adam eternal
[22:23] life is yeah but I got in the steelbook
[22:29] where he said that Adam fell from
[22:32] eternal line show me where he fell from
[22:34] eternal life show me where he fell - did
[22:37] he fall to hell did he miss it all no
[22:40] way now you you've got he fell from the
[22:43] fact that he never reached eternal life
[22:44] in body that ought to be plain sense
[22:48] without any revelation he might beat you
[22:50] over the head with they never reached
[22:52] the position
[22:53] all right the church he's got to come
[22:55] back to that because according to the
[22:57] Prophet what all that Adam lost Christ
[23:03] has come to redeem all right we would
[23:07] have come to the Tree of Life protecting
[23:09] the Tree of Life and been made eternal
[23:11] in body and spirit but we fell for we
[23:14] got to the church started out on the
[23:17] defini coast with the new birth in there
[23:22] born-again experience in the soul and
[23:26] that's what God build his church on and
[23:28] that's where it's been ever aged it's
[23:31] been that new birth but you lost the
[23:34] channel his weight was bringing out
[23:36] Sunday afternoon so you lost the channel
[23:40] when you come on up through you know
[23:43] Paul I rainiest Martin Colombo right in
[23:45] there you begin to deteriorate away and
[23:49] Luther come out of it with the just
[23:51] shall live by faith the Trinitarian
[23:53] smoking a pop drinking his beer
[23:56] yeah because it wouldn't anybody to
[24:00] condemn me but when he got to measure do
[24:03] the just shall live by faith
[24:05] restoration was coming now I said coming
[24:10] because you got to be careful because
[24:12] the just shall live by faith brings you
[24:14] to Reformation Luther was Reformation
[24:17] Wesley was Reformation but the
[24:19] Pentecostal Azusa Street wouldn't
[24:21] Reformation
[24:24] it was the birth all right let's get on
[24:27] to it then so what have we been talking
[24:28] about now some how do you understand
[24:30] what I say and what our teach and what I
[24:33] believe all right now but if you're
[24:38] coming to me to talk to me about it I
[24:40] want you to bring your books and your
[24:42] Bible don't just come up so well brother
[24:46] Taylor I think you're wrong right here I
[24:48] want to know why that you're saying now
[24:54] if you're willing to say you think I'm
[24:57] wrong you ought to be willing to try to
[24:59] show them wrong but you know what then
[25:02] I've got to put it to the basis if you
[25:03] show me I'm wrong I can be corrected try
[25:07] to worry about it I'm gonna win either
[25:11] way
[25:14] because if I'm proved wrong I can win by
[25:16] getting away from my wrong but are you
[25:19] willing to put it on the line you better
[25:24] be willing you better know where you're
[25:27] at
[25:27] we ain't gotten a long time to start
[25:30] trying to figure out where raft right I
[25:33] think we better get serious about the
[25:37] message all right now listen so just
[25:41] back up to where we're at to review just
[25:43] a higher know this quote quote quote and
[25:45] run on
[25:47] so what is the new birth now the birth
[25:52] of the word is Christ now don't pull
[25:54] these up because we're on 1 2 3 they
[25:57] won't start till about number 5 or 6 all
[26:01] right
[26:01] that's the spoken word is regional see
[26:04] also this message that in spoke already
[26:07] written OC to be born of the word and
[26:09] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[26:13] again like in John 3 in other words the
[26:18] same thing to Nicodemus what's now to be
[26:22] born to the water and of this and the
[26:24] spirit what does it do and it brings us
[26:28] right back again unto the place of were
[26:32] you should have been at the beginning
[26:37] takes you right back now there's a quote
[26:40] on over in write a while I'm gonna get
[26:42] to it the Reverend said I never saw that
[26:44] he brings out something close to that
[26:47] and he said but I never seen that he
[26:48] hadn't called it to write to him seem to
[26:51] be born of the word and spirit takes us
[26:53] back like we should have been without a
[26:56] fallen condition all right so that's
[26:58] what I'm contending for that kind of a
[27:02] new birth not I cried spoke in tongues
[27:07] shouting Allah wonderful we believe in
[27:09] all of that there's nobody in this
[27:12] building believes an emotion more than
[27:13] this man
[27:15] I've talked to you about it I smelt the
[27:18] presence of God I'm done all things I
[27:21] don't have to worry about it that's not
[27:24] to try to make anything differences be
[27:26] truth listen what a brother runs safe
[27:31] what is the new birth brother branham
[27:33] cross the mystery it's a revelation of
[27:35] Jesus Christ personally to you not you
[27:40] said ik redundant or doctor or anything
[27:42] we joined a church or shook a hand but
[27:46] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[27:49] revealed to you and no matter what
[27:52] anybody else says what takes place
[27:55] it's Christ see pastors priests or
[27:59] whatever it whatever it might its Christ
[28:02] in you that is the revelation that the
[28:06] church was built upon Christ in you he
[28:11] said no to her I didn't know it would
[28:12] build on Jesus now come on do we need to
[28:14] get into that didn't know how far do we
[28:17] need to explain it's not like the
[28:18] Catholic they believe it was all in
[28:20] Peter and it's not like a apostles it
[28:22] was all in Christ it's what is Christ in
[28:25] you Christ in you the hope of glory
[28:27] right all right it's Christ being
[28:30] revealed and he is the word and when the
[28:35] word is it revealed it expresses itself
[28:41] when it's revealed what is the new birth
[28:46] didn't revelation in Jesus Christ how do
[28:50] you get born again patmans vision for
[28:53] you can only be it can only be known by
[28:56] revelation and you can only be saved by
[28:59] revelation he said you have a head
[29:03] knowledge of it intellectually but you
[29:05] can't be saved until it's revealed to
[29:08] you no man can call Jesus the Christ
[29:11] only by the Holy Ghost right but you see
[29:16] where I get into that I say things to
[29:19] people you talking about me you're
[29:21] against me cause you you know I'm a
[29:22] little you know that I'm a little
[29:24] emotional am I thinking praise God I
[29:26] wish we were all emotional
[29:28] I wish we were running
[29:29] however time I remember when brother ray
[29:34] used to run miles no remember so other
[29:40] brother was done that letter one day
[29:41] this this brother was preaching it and
[29:44] his brother came around and and this
[29:46] brother was standing there and he
[29:47] watched him make one circle around in
[29:49] the church and he started the second I
[29:52] said he'll never make the third one when
[29:56] he came the third time the brother was
[29:57] right behind him and if they'd made four
[29:59] I guess I'd have been behind the
[30:00] inventor all right God I believe in it
[30:03] I don't believe you put it first I
[30:07] believe you put it we're supposed to be
[30:09] faith is a revelation from God now we're
[30:13] picking up kind of where we're getting
[30:14] to what faith is a revelation okay now
[30:18] what is it
[30:19] it gives give you by the grace of God
[30:22] and God reveals it to you therefore
[30:26] faith is a revelation and the whole
[30:31] Church of God is built upon the
[30:33] revelation but it's like I've tried to
[30:37] explain see it's people want to stay on
[30:41] the simplified matter and I try to make
[30:43] it so simple that's why I said I believe
[30:45] the new birth the born-again experience
[30:46] the baptism with the Holy Ghost is all
[30:49] the same and it's the experience you go
[30:52] through we see you said well I can see
[30:54] the birth and I can see the born-again
[30:56] but I like to see the baptism coming
[30:58] down let's show it to them in the Bible
[31:03] that's all I've ever asked according to
[31:06] the profit and the dividing of the
[31:07] pillar of fire was the tongues of fire
[31:09] that was sitting on each one of them in
[31:12] the upper row you see right then right
[31:22] then in that upper room was fulfilled a
[31:26] major portion of the scriptures that
[31:28] Jesus spoke because he said when he the
[31:31] Holy Ghost has come he'll bring to your
[31:33] remembrance whatsoever I say it and
[31:35] teach you things to come
[31:37] I said that's a quote add it on to it
[31:40] but that's the way the Prophet wrote you
[31:42] didn't teach you things to come
[31:43] what is it go ahead and number six we've
[31:50] done these the other day but I want it
[31:51] all together where we'll understand he
[31:53] said the rapture is a revelation to her
[31:54] it's revealed to her that the revelation
[31:57] the true Bride of Christ will be waiting
[31:58] for the revelation of the rapture
[32:00] so the rapture is a revelation as I
[32:04] saying then it's hard to think about the
[32:07] new birth being a revelation but why not
[32:12] why not think of it is it not true that
[32:16] God spoke to you and called you now
[32:22] remember the Bible says you're not
[32:24] called you can't come and that's the
[32:26] father calling you right it's not you
[32:29] coming he's him calling you all right
[32:31] they speaking to you then when he
[32:35] quickens to you that new birth is that
[32:38] making alive that word that you have
[32:40] heard how much simpler can it be yeah
[32:44] but I wanted to baptism coming floating
[32:49] why why Cannot you believe what a
[32:53] prophet said look that's a revelation
[33:00] where revelation is faith and you cannot
[33:05] have a revelation without it being faith
[33:11] faith is revelation because there's
[33:13] something that's revealed to you faith
[33:15] is a revelation faith is something that
[33:17] has been revealed to you like it was to
[33:19] Abraham that could call anything
[33:21] contrary to what had been revealed to
[33:24] him as though it wasn't so now faith
[33:28] that's what faith is
[33:30] it's the revelation of God the church is
[33:33] built upon him a revelation of God so
[33:38] you know what the new birth is God
[33:40] revealing himself to you how much more
[33:44] simpler can it be how much more simpler
[33:48] can it be made than to say the new birth
[33:50] is God revealing himself to you
[33:57] we get them called deep I'm calling this
[34:00] that and the other people don't under
[34:01] they don't understand is that I can't
[34:03] understand brother Dale he's so far out
[34:04] for how her
[34:08] and what's more simpler can that be you
[34:15] remember this from how faith in God go
[34:16] ahead to number seven he's talking about
[34:20] faith it's also an experience
[34:30] faith is an experience come on over to
[34:36] my subject how faith in God now we are
[34:41] taught in God's blessed word that faith
[34:44] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[34:45] word of the Lord of God word of the word
[34:48] is now faith is also an experience then
[34:53] he puts an experience back into your
[34:55] life as the things happening to you see
[34:58] and many times faith is had my former
[35:00] experience makes faith grow a former
[35:04] experience will make faith grow
[35:07] I thought we believe in growing up in
[35:10] him
[35:13] I thought that was what we're for oh no
[35:17] we're just here to speak in tongues
[35:18] shout and have a good time and many
[35:24] times faith is had by former experience
[35:26] makes faith grow faith being the
[35:28] substance of things hoped for the
[35:30] evidence of things that's not seen so
[35:32] many people fail to find the real
[35:33] meaning of what faith is some people
[35:36] believe that faith is some sensation or
[35:39] some emotion but the Bible said that
[35:41] faith is the substance of things hoped
[35:44] for
[35:45] it's just an experience to you that's
[35:50] why you're being born again it's an
[35:53] experience that's taking place in your
[35:56] in your soul well some things it's
[35:59] mental conception of the word but that's
[36:03] not right
[36:04] faith is a substance faith is not a myth
[36:07] say faith is the substance of things
[36:09] hoped for the evidence what to have an
[36:13] evidence it must be of substance if
[36:16] you've got an evidence as to what your
[36:19] Holy Ghost is and it's not a substance
[36:23] what have you got you got mythology's
[36:26] you got mental conception shortly
[36:31] speaking in tongues crying Allah we
[36:33] believe in every bit of that but
[36:35] remember Satan can't impersonate every
[36:39] one of them and brought around sanity
[36:41] even pies out supernatural gifts so
[36:45] don't go into all of the guilts and all
[36:46] of this that Miller I know I'm saved
[36:48] because of that your gift to get anyway
[36:51] it'll work but it'll get in your way
[36:53] why call he will take you away from the
[36:54] word so if your evidence is not a
[37:00] substance now then my evidence is what
[37:03] the prophets say it's whether or not the
[37:05] spirit in you agrees with the word if it
[37:12] denies the word there's no substance but
[37:15] you've got the greatest substance in
[37:17] tahrir because you've got faith that's
[37:19] the substance of God's Word anchored in
[37:22] your heart
[37:23] by you accepting Jesus Christ as your
[37:26] Savior and much more simple look it's
[37:33] not something that your imagine in your
[37:34] mind it's something that you absolutely
[37:36] you have it's something that you possess
[37:40] in your own being now I admit I admit to
[37:45] one time because a lot of people's never
[37:49] had a substance faith experience maybe
[37:54] something that you knew was right and
[37:57] real and going to take place but nobody
[38:03] else would believe you if you ever
[38:07] really had a substance faith something
[38:10] that you knew you were healed it didn't
[38:14] make no difference what took place you
[38:18] got worse that's what's supposed to be
[38:23] if you ever had something that's just a
[38:25] substance that nobody can take away from
[38:29] you now we got one in here where brother
[38:31] Ron said faith is the substance of the
[38:33] fact that something that God says gives
[38:35] you a right to confess you have it when
[38:37] you don't even hold it right there God
[38:41] gives you a right to say it
[38:42] listen oh here it is
[38:45] and what is it it's the evidence of
[38:47] things that you have hope for it's the
[38:49] evidence of things that you do not have
[38:51] as yet but you have the authority of God
[38:54] to say that you have it
[38:59] listen Church I've tried to say this
[39:01] over and over people I know what does
[39:03] saith the Lord he is and I know what but
[39:05] you know what this Bible is dust saith
[39:07] the Lord
[39:08] you know this Bible says by stripes I'm
[39:10] healed that's thus saith the Lord
[39:15] yeah but we only believe it's for the
[39:17] profit well that's where you're in bad
[39:20] shape because it'd probably be the only
[39:21] one who can get born again it's not
[39:26] something that you just kind of a push
[39:28] yourself to I've noticed so much of that
[39:31] in my meetings that people try to work
[39:33] themselves up into something to make
[39:35] them believe now you can't do that you
[39:38] just beaten the iron but faith is
[39:40] something that you're just as calm and
[39:42] settled as it can be it's taking God at
[39:45] His Word and having the assurance in
[39:48] your heart that God is able to keep what
[39:51] he has said that he would do and will
[39:54] perform anything that he said he would
[39:57] do what are you why would you even think
[40:06] about well you see I'm I'm preaching to
[40:12] you that here but also I'm on the
[40:14] Internet
[40:15] you know this goes around the world at
[40:17] one time we were 156 countries we're
[40:19] viewing in wouldn't you be afraid to get
[40:24] up here and say what you believe no I'm
[40:27] not I'm not a bit of right I have no
[40:33] problem cuz I believe he's been proven
[40:40] to be true so what I worry about it
[40:46] but if he stands one time in a position
[40:49] to her that you knew something they're
[40:51] going to take place and there's no way
[40:55] that anybody talked you out of it you'll
[40:57] find out what a substance really is okay
[41:01] what's now taking God as his word on the
[41:05] adulterated faith is what taking God is
[41:07] his word okay did we get through a
[41:11] revelation is faith all right let's go
[41:15] on over I know I read these Sunday but I
[41:20] want you to listen to what say it listen
[41:26] what brother Brown says on earnestly
[41:28] contended number eight my brother it's
[41:34] my faith you're saved that right but
[41:38] listen in accepting of your faith God
[41:43] confirms your faith by the baptism of
[41:46] the Holy Ghost now he confirms your
[41:51] faith other words he mouths at this way
[41:54] you can say well I've accepted Jesus
[41:56] Christ I've accepted Jesus Christ
[41:58] brought around made a statement one day
[42:00] that told us all through loophole didn't
[42:02] it because he said has God accepted you
[42:05] he said you can accept him every day in
[42:08] other words in misery but it has he
[42:10] accepted you if he's accepted you you
[42:13] don't want to worry about a fight I
[42:14] don't mean you know everything but you
[42:16] want to worry about it God confirms your
[42:18] faith by the baptism of the holy God if
[42:20] you say you believe and you don't get
[42:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you
[42:26] do not know what it your faith isn't
[42:29] accepted in the sight of God if you
[42:32] don't get it when you say you got it and
[42:36] you take God at His Word and say I've
[42:38] got two baptism when the Holy Ghost look
[42:40] what you better be anchored on you're
[42:42] saying what God said we're going to get
[42:46] to that mental faith in a minute look
[42:49] your faith isn't accepted in their side
[42:51] of God you've got a mental faith instead
[42:55] of a heartfelt faith
[42:57] that's right when you truly believe God
[42:59] gods under obligation to pour the Holy
[43:02] Ghost on you and then if he does pour
[43:05] that Holy Ghost on you you said well
[43:07] I've got the Holy Ghost - well if you do
[43:10] you're bound to believe in that super
[43:13] net in the supernatural signs and
[43:15] wonders because you're added to it
[43:19] that's the truth now people of the
[43:24] message believe brother Branham had
[43:27] supernatural signs and wonders right
[43:30] we know that I mean that's no problem
[43:34] but what about you what about a
[43:41] statement read a random made he said in
[43:46] the Bride of Christ one day will be the
[43:48] Ministry of Jesus Christ well no that
[43:56] was in brother Branham big man in this
[44:00] message they didn't going on I'm going
[44:02] off on says he isn't I heard him say
[44:05] this statement he said that the third
[44:08] pool was for Jesus Christ and brother
[44:12] Branham but was not for you anybody else
[44:15] now that was the man's word at the third
[44:19] pool now according to what I heard the
[44:22] prophets say he said so much contrary to
[44:26] that man until that man not even they
[44:28] said because you know what he said he
[44:30] said the third pool is far the bride
[44:32] listen and the church
[44:42] for the bride and the church now what is
[44:45] the end charge that's gonna have to be
[44:48] foolish virgins insane cuz that's not
[44:50] bride right he said into the totally
[44:54] lost well I just I just don't believe I
[45:00] just don't believe that then we have it
[45:02] like bread around I've explained that to
[45:04] you over and over and over around the
[45:06] world tonight the Ministry of Jesus
[45:11] Christ is being made manifest put it all
[45:15] together
[45:16] you've got the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[45:19] not in one person no we're not looking
[45:21] for that that's what's caused all this
[45:24] running after these new ones that come
[45:25] out with doctrines and this one and that
[45:27] one in that one and everybody run i from
[45:32] me never run I just won't down the road
[45:39] just come down the road you know like I
[45:42] like what somebody said just let it let
[45:44] it run its course okay let's go let's go
[45:50] a little further let's go to this one I
[45:56] love blasphemous night and look what he
[45:59] says the biggest part of our faith is
[46:04] mental faith
[46:08] now I see two facets has always been in
[46:11] the message maybe other would better
[46:14] words are saying but two things I see a
[46:17] people who on one side said we've got
[46:20] everything we got everything we got
[46:22] everything I see the other side wind got
[46:24] everything we got nothing
[46:27] that reminds me of the about the writing
[46:30] of the cheque but no money in the bank
[46:31] you know if we could get that together
[46:33] it might work but look the biggest part
[46:39] of our faith is mental faith by hearing
[46:42] the word it brings us to a mental
[46:46] recognition of God Hey look but if this
[46:52] coming from above
[46:54] old brother if it ever strikes this
[46:58] there's a godly super spiritual faith
[47:02] now what's he talking about
[47:06] but this coming from above when you get
[47:11] born again that's what I believe it you
[47:16] have a connection to the headstone you
[47:19] have a connection to all of these
[47:20] virtues in the faith of the father and
[47:22] you have a connection to the edge stuff
[47:24] what is calling you what is calling you
[47:29] is to a deeper depth the day you were
[47:33] born again it made your contact with God
[47:36] and he's drawing you is that not a
[47:44] growth development is that not child
[47:46] training is that not adoption is not all
[47:48] of those things a prophet called
[47:50] feeding into that look then what does
[47:54] that faith do if your mental faith
[47:59] something happens to it because of
[48:03] spiritual faith then what does that
[48:05] faith do that faith recognizes only the
[48:09] word okay no matter what anything else
[48:14] says it can only recognize the word
[48:16] because in the beginning was the word
[48:18] and the Word was with God and the
[48:21] was God and the word is still God and
[48:22] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[48:25] us and when the word itself is pouring
[48:28] into our faith our mental faith becomes
[48:35] a spiritual revelation now remember
[48:45] we're not going to get there not cut on
[48:47] the way
[48:47] but remember read Peter add to your
[48:52] faith so when the Holy Ghost unites with
[49:01] mankind or the word he's pouring into
[49:04] our mental faith becomes a spiritual
[49:07] revelation you start with a mental faith
[49:12] I wish to God right now that the part I
[49:15] have in my mountain in mental part of me
[49:19] you know what is mental I wish it was
[49:21] revealed I don't believe it is I'm not
[49:26] honest I don't believe everything I read
[49:29] and instead is revealed to me I want it
[49:33] revealed but I also know that even after
[49:39] we leave this world the prophets said
[49:41] they'd be a message of cheer after the
[49:44] endless ages was over we'll have a
[49:48] wonderful time learning because we only
[49:49] have the carnality of mine okay all
[49:53] right look and oppose this foundation
[49:58] I'll build my church not upon a mental
[50:00] conception of Church corny joining a
[50:02] mental conception of that but upon the
[50:05] revelation when them streams of grace
[50:08] you remember the message sister
[50:12] shepherd's dream the water was running
[50:14] the Holy Spirit
[50:15] you know the master pouring the message
[50:17] in up to talk we'll get back to that and
[50:18] running down those streams coming
[50:20] outside
[50:23] Larry and the streams of grace is poured
[50:26] into that mental faith that you've got
[50:27] then upon this a spiritual revelation
[50:30] I'll build my church and the gates of
[50:31] Hell can't prevail against it
[50:33] see that shows they would be against it
[50:36] but it will never prevail oh what a
[50:39] glorious thing let's see the faith the

[53:34] pain
[53:35] precious faith now notice listen to
[53:37] notice he is saying that I have obtained
[53:41] this faith

[53:49] addressing this to them that has
[53:51] obtained the like precious faith
[53:54] I won't it's not to the outside world
[53:59] this is to the church those that are in
[54:03] Christ let's say a moment ago maybe
[54:06] didn't clear don't know the Bible is not
[54:08] written to sinner's they can't
[54:11] comprehend it the only thing a sinner
[54:15] can learn from the Bible is head
[54:17] knowledge and he can learn that God
[54:20] wants to save him but he's got to get a
[54:25] revelation look now you know and just go
[54:29] to that we can take a whole message on
[54:30] that part teaching what divine nature
[54:35] the stature of a perfect man is teaching
[54:37] the divine nature of Almighty God add to
[54:40] your faith virtue or knowledge template
[54:42] page regardless that's the divine nature
[54:43] of Almighty God look what it says see
[54:46] the world you escaped we've escaped that
[54:49] now he's addressing this to the church
[54:51] that's why we're here this morning is to
[54:54] find out what is the way what is God's
[54:58] requirement there's not a person in here
[55:00] that don't want to do that and he told
[55:01] my sister kidding them want to be close
[55:02] what is your heart's desire it'll be
[55:06] closer to God when you learn a Christ
[55:08] there's something about him that makes
[55:09] the soul loving you just try to get
[55:12] right into him yeah all right what do we
[55:16] got next
[55:23] off the message all the days of our life
[55:29] to show he's bringing adoption bring it
[55:32] on up this was preached in 59 okay 59
[55:42] 612 before he preached the statute of
[55:46] perfect man in 62 or 61 look what he
[55:52] said then it would become a slave to
[55:57] Jesus Christ to serve Him in love and
[56:00] you my brothers and sisters who are like
[56:03] precious faith who's been born of the
[56:06] Holy Ghost
[56:06] this had the blood of Jesus Christ to
[56:09] sanctify and cleanse you from all the
[56:11] filth of the world that died daily to
[56:14] the flesh crucified putting it away and
[56:17] become a slave in your own body to serve
[56:19] God look for a CD 59 he knew about
[56:23] precious faith he didn't start out
[56:29] preaching I mean didn't have to wait Lee
[56:33] got to 65 to preach the statue of a
[56:35] perfect man he was a prophet you
[56:42] remember what I say it you remember the
[56:45] message the other day you see you can
[56:49] bring the statue of a perfect man and
[56:52] the faith of the fathers now not the
[56:55] headstone code it ain't come yet
[56:56] so you forget that you can bring the
[56:59] faith of the fathers through for ages
[57:03] dying in the fourth one going away in
[57:11] the fourth age 50 age six to age seventh
[57:16] age you don't have the revelation of
[57:20] Jesus Christ you have a Trinitarian
[57:24] doctrine
[57:27] and you have a Zeus's Street with we got
[57:31] everything when we believe that ain't
[57:32] much more than us Baptist which was
[57:34] about a hundred or so years before then
[57:38] we got everything when we believed
[57:42] sounded like some of the believers in
[57:44] the message on all right but listen
[57:53] and I go to number 14 statue of perfect
[57:57] man pray you make a phone call and say
[58:05] pray huh that contact and your faith
[58:09] brings God and listen to it's the thing
[58:12] that brings the prayer and God together
[58:14] on the scene prior faith changes from
[58:20] here to here now you know what he's
[58:23] talking about faith don't change from
[58:25] here to here faith changes from here
[58:29] right head knowledge mental faith to
[58:34] here heart heart faith we read there a
[58:39] minute ago
[58:43] changes from here to here it brings it
[58:45] okay brain only now faith does the rest
[58:48] of it faith does the rest so we must
[58:50] have faith for a foundation
[58:53] all Christianity oh you are and all
[58:58] you'll ever be is based upon faith in
[59:02] the word that reason that's the reason I
[59:09] believe the word look you must have
[59:13] faith for a foundation
[59:15] now what's your foundation then we're
[59:21] down under here you're upside down
[59:22] tonight faith is the foundation for
[59:25] everything faith is the foundation for
[59:30] everything that we all need up okay
[59:34] faith very simple little word faith
[59:41] it'll be all Christianity they remember
[59:46] remember what a priest twenty five
[59:49] thirty sermons starting in Genesis and
[59:54] what do we start talking about faith to
[59:59] believe God faith to believe God all the
[1:00:06] Old Testament salvation of whatever you
[1:00:09] brought it was based upon faith whether
[1:00:13] it be the offering of a lamb will be
[1:00:15] into what it was based upon faith to
[1:00:18] believe God
[1:00:20] well why would you want to change to
[1:00:22] something else when you started the
[1:00:23] church on the dip in account from faith
[1:00:27] you're not listening to what I said Adam
[1:00:30] and Eve started with eternal life all
[1:00:32] that was coming down and then you come
[1:00:33] over here with Jesus restore all things
[1:00:35] and on the day of Pentecost he restores
[1:00:37] eternal life back to the soul of mankind
[1:00:43] come on when I put my faith in his word
[1:00:48] is anchored nobody interpreting here it
[1:00:52] is thus saith the Lord and I believe
[1:00:54] that there's the basis everything is
[1:00:57] based upon faith where do we get to what
[1:01:03] was that 14 let's go to 15 the stature
[1:01:08] of a perfect man notice you must be born
[1:01:11] again and when you're born again you
[1:01:16] can't be born again without having faith
[1:01:22] no that's right so you see on my chart
[1:01:26] here the drawing I got the very
[1:01:30] foundation of faith is the foundation
[1:01:33] this is what the church is built on
[1:01:37] faith revelation from God faith is the
[1:01:45] foundation of all of it for without
[1:01:46] faith it's impossible to please God he
[1:01:48] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:01:50] is you might as well stay back in other
[1:01:53] words if you don't believe the word
[1:01:54] you're skeptic of the Bible and you're
[1:01:56] skeptic well I don't know where the
[1:01:58] Prophet mint is I don't know whether he
[1:01:59] meant this over here or what did he mean
[1:02:01] here or what has he do what he said you
[1:02:05] just might as well stay back
[1:02:09] right until what you might as well stay
[1:02:15] back until first you believe it
[1:02:17] what do you seeing I believe there's
[1:02:19] only two elements that controls the
[1:02:20] human being that's either doubt of faith
[1:02:22] one or the other
[1:02:23] you're possessed of the one that do not
[1:02:25] dominate your life just depends on how
[1:02:29] much faith you have how high you can
[1:02:31] rise but first it's got to be faith let
[1:02:36] me say on that foundation for a while
[1:02:38] now faith is what you must believe faith
[1:02:42] is what faith is the substance of things
[1:02:44] hoped for it's it's you already have it
[1:02:49] when you have faith you already got your
[1:02:52] substance because it's revealed in faith
[1:02:54] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:02:56] for Hebrews 11 what kind of an evidence
[1:03:00] a holy evidence he says and watching it
[1:03:02] but actually believing you got it he's
[1:03:06] coming down and people are missing it
[1:03:09] actually believing that by His stripes
[1:03:11] you are healed there's nothing going to
[1:03:13] turn you from it
[1:03:16] but when you got faith you know it
[1:03:18] because it's the evidence foundation of
[1:03:24] all Christianity all salvation is based
[1:03:29] on faith in God that can I make a couple
[1:03:33] of this personal point cuz I got him
[1:03:37] over here and we'll get to it when I'm
[1:03:38] running late on there's a lot of
[1:03:43] difference in having faith in God than
[1:03:47] having the faith of God you with me you
[1:03:53] say well I've got faith in God a lot of
[1:03:55] difference in heaven the faith of God
[1:04:00] right if you got the faith of God what
[1:04:05] has happened we'll get down to this but
[1:04:08] look what he saying when your mental
[1:04:11] faith becomes a spiritual revelation see
[1:04:14] there's no longer your faith anymore
[1:04:16] you see his faith
[1:04:20] he's his thing
[1:04:22] he's coming lived in you he imparts his
[1:04:27] own life into you sure it belongs to you
[1:04:31] because he gave it to you now quote
[1:04:32] brother branham this is my I God gave it
[1:04:35] to me so don't run off with the wrong
[1:04:37] line when you receive that new birth
[1:04:41] when that soul is quickened to life by
[1:04:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost from their
[1:04:48] own is his life in you that's why it
[1:04:53] only says at one time in their statute a
[1:04:55] perfect man it says add to your faith
[1:04:57] then it says add virtue add knowledge
[1:05:01] why because you got to put it on
[1:05:04] something that's why they couldn't
[1:05:08] understand brother Branham see I've been
[1:05:09] through this church this was the
[1:05:11] seventies and you know a lot of you was
[1:05:15] there but I wonder what she's listening
[1:05:16] to them
[1:05:19] well I poke for that brother he didn't
[1:05:22] say that
[1:05:28] I wish you would do me a favor I wish
[1:05:32] you would be just as picky about me and
[1:05:35] what I say as you're defensive about
[1:05:40] what the others have say it and coming
[1:05:46] let's talk about it coming let's sit
[1:05:52] down talk about because you cannot be
[1:06:00] born again without it being faith and
[1:06:03] that's the very foundation of all
[1:06:05] Christianity why brother branham take
[1:06:07] this message and do this it's in the
[1:06:09] statute of perfect man he said I just
[1:06:11] got the other day this scripture he
[1:06:13] earned the way it ties in that was 1962
[1:06:18] yet he was teaching it the fifties
[1:06:21] probably the forties and we don't have
[1:06:25] the record of that but what's he saying
[1:06:28] where we're at go ahead go ahead to the
[1:06:34] next which is 16
[1:06:39] first you must be born again and when
[1:06:41] you're born again you have faith you
[1:06:42] believe the word until you're born again
[1:06:44] you'll argue against it you're just
[1:06:47] religiously in kind and you've got a got
[1:06:49] a little human knowledge that you should
[1:06:51] do right you will never be able to agree
[1:06:54] upon the Word of God you'll never do it
[1:06:56] you've got to be born again and born
[1:06:58] again it produces faith all right then
[1:07:00] after you get faith this is right here
[1:07:03] if they ought to get faith then you're
[1:07:05] just in position of growing you know
[1:07:10] what a baby
[1:07:11] sure for nine months it's doing pretty
[1:07:15] good girl but it really when does it
[1:07:17] start its growth as a baby when it exits
[1:07:20] a mother's wound and it becomes a living
[1:07:23] soul
[1:07:29] so he says now a lot of people go up to
[1:07:31] the altar pray and say Lord forgive me
[1:07:33] and watch him and a great experience of
[1:07:38] sanctification comes upon them and thing
[1:07:42] then you have a great time get up to the
[1:07:45] older shouting you go back saying bless
[1:07:48] God I got it
[1:07:56] no you just started to a place where you
[1:07:59] can grow you're not born again you just
[1:08:03] started to play you ain't done nothing
[1:08:05] you have to the only thing you've done
[1:08:07] is just laid the foundation when you get
[1:08:10] the Newburgh you just laid the
[1:08:12] foundation now when we get into adoption
[1:08:14] with it to worry that a baby that's born
[1:08:16] into a family right it's a child the day
[1:08:22] it's born it's full inheritance
[1:08:24] everything is settled the day it's born
[1:08:26] but it's got to grow into it and come to
[1:08:29] a position to the adoption an adoption
[1:08:34] is really not a Jewish thing adoption
[1:08:37] come through from the Romans I thank you
[1:08:38] truck but it was brought over into the
[1:08:41] to the Jews they wasn't actually the one
[1:08:43] that first brought in the adoption all
[1:08:45] time they incorporated it because it was
[1:08:47] right it was in the word it was right
[1:08:49] and they know it's right okay watch them
[1:08:52] now you're going to build a house and
[1:08:57] you pour the foundation say boy I got
[1:08:59] her see you got the foundation to build
[1:09:02] your house on now you got to build a
[1:09:05] house you got it by faith your new birth
[1:09:09] you filled into the kingdom your soul is
[1:09:12] eternal isn't it ever been but you've
[1:09:14] got to build the body of Christ
[1:09:21] because you're just born into it you
[1:09:24] pour the foundation there's where the
[1:09:27] thing comes in this morning we got to
[1:09:30] talk about now all right
[1:09:31] a house this foundation is first what is
[1:09:35] the foundation of Christianity faith in
[1:09:38] the Word of God that's your foundation
[1:09:40] then you begin to grow then you start
[1:09:44] you begin to add to this foundation
[1:09:55] well we got go ahead 17 not you're a
[1:10:01] perfect man come on Richard said you
[1:10:06] already read the whole book I've asked

[1:11:41] what's the first thing you have faith
[1:11:44] and be born again that's laying the
[1:11:46] foundation then after you lay the
[1:11:47] foundation secondly you add to your
[1:11:49] foundation

[1:12:22] can't do it the first thing you've got
[1:12:25] to do is be born again you've got to be
[1:12:29] changed when you're changed you become a
[1:12:33] new creation
[1:12:33] now you're getting right now you don't

[1:12:59] that Jesus said it come on man be born
[1:13:02] again and he can't even see the kingdom
[1:13:04] and that means he means to understand he
[1:13:07] can't do with that okay go ahead
[1:13:09] let's pick up the lights too and we'll
[1:13:11] call it quits this is from why I'm
[1:13:15] against organized religion this the
[1:13:17] state but I want you to get from it oh
[1:13:19] this is priest in 62 right in with a
[1:13:22] statue of perfect man when God says come
[1:13:25] to be born and they say come join see
[1:13:30] when the baptism of the Holy Spirit is
[1:13:31] falsely took over for a wafer in the
[1:13:34] Catholic Church a handshake in the
[1:13:36] Protestants and emotion in the
[1:13:38] Pentecostal church instead of the person
[1:13:42] of Christ coming in with all that
[1:13:45] pyramid-building we had the other day
[1:13:48] now that stature of a perfect man
[1:13:51] pyramid-building instead of the person
[1:13:54] coming into all the pyramid now add to
[1:13:56] your faith virtue and so forth all this
[1:13:59] in first Peter the FIR we should second
[1:14:02] Peter okay all these things got in this
[1:14:06] and all again everything and when you're
[1:14:09] sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:14:19] go down to the lights when brother
[1:14:21] rooster quit on it
[1:14:22] number 22 I think it is yeah but will
[1:14:26] will pop icicle this is from the tire in
[1:14:29] church age I know your faith he does not
[1:14:36] say here as he did to the church in
[1:14:38] Pergamos you hold my faith and watch it
[1:14:42] he doesn't say this now because you're
[1:14:45] at a tower he is not talking about his
[1:14:49] faith now he is commending them for
[1:14:54] their faithfulness and as he does he
[1:14:59] also mentions their patience the
[1:15:02] faithfulness and patience go together
[1:15:05] in fact patience is out working of
[1:15:08] faithfulness the trial of your faith
[1:15:10] what are you saying because there's a
[1:15:17] vast difference that I said a moment ago
[1:15:20] in saying how faith in God and how the
[1:15:27] faith of God even how faith in God and
[1:15:31] you're not born again you can have a
[1:15:35] head knowledge you can go through all
[1:15:36] the things as Paul said know all the
[1:15:39] mysteries in hell not faith sounding
[1:15:49] brass and a tinkling cymbal you read the
[1:15:55] whole message
[1:16:00] some of you will remember the doctrines
[1:16:02] it with our and understand why that I
[1:16:11] just I can't go with it because I
[1:16:15] believe you're born again at faith you
[1:16:20] get the baptism with the Holy Ghost when
[1:16:23] you're born again the born-again the new
[1:16:26] birth and the baptism is all the same
[1:16:28] it's all right so we'll reentrant side
[1:16:32] or state again on the day of pentecost
[1:16:35] the disciples received right here the
[1:16:40] holy spirit and it's called the faith of
[1:16:44] the father now remember and you don't
[1:16:49] hear his talk no more do you you may be
[1:16:52] heard lately am i talking about the
[1:16:53] faith of the fathers serious but what
[1:17:02] about malachi for what about it
[1:17:11] melikhaya forcedly turned the hearts of
[1:17:14] the lot children fathers to the children
[1:17:17] and their children to the father Sean
[1:17:22] turned them to the New Testament message
[1:17:26] Malachi 4 had to come to turn us back to
[1:17:29] the faith of the fathers little random
[1:17:35] made an outstanding statement in the
[1:17:37] church age book he said this messenger
[1:17:40] of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7
[1:17:44] will do two things 1 turn the hearts of
[1:17:53] the children to the father's why because
[1:17:59] we lost that realm that way that the
[1:18:02] thoughts of a statue of a perfect man
[1:18:03] were not in Luther Wesleyan in Azusa
[1:18:06] streets and the things like that no just
[1:18:09] shouting glory had a loser trying to be
[1:18:10] a good person and all of that and it was
[1:18:12] God for that day
[1:18:15] but they never walked into faith you see
[1:18:19] Malachi for was to come to turn the
[1:18:22] hearts of the children then back to the
[1:18:26] faith of the Father and I've made this
[1:18:28] statement and I made it 40 years ago and
[1:18:31] I might as well keep on making it if
[1:18:34] everybody in the world of the seven
[1:18:37] billion people in the world today had
[1:18:42] the faith of the fathers the wonderful
[1:18:46] world on them but they'd be nothing
[1:18:50] there or the redemption of the body to
[1:18:54] finish the full plan Paul only spoke of
[1:18:58] this case you want to run it by Colonel
[1:18:59] about Paul only spoke of controlling the
[1:19:01] body he brought it down to a life
[1:19:07] statement that we'll get to in the
[1:19:09] message he brought it to his life
[1:19:11] statement when he got over in Romans 8
[1:19:16] and he brings adoption as whereby we cry
[1:19:19] out my father read your scripts Romans 8
[1:19:23] then he brings it down to the baby form
[1:19:28] started then he brings it down to the
[1:19:31] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:19:33] of God then he makes an outstanding
[1:19:36] statement and he says let's read it
[1:19:43] let's read it cuz I don't want to miss
[1:19:46] read it Romans 8
[1:19:57] mmm-hmm they can pull that up if they
[1:20:00] get a change where you can read it
[1:20:03] Romans eight listen what he's talking
[1:20:07] about for as many as are led by the
[1:20:12] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:20:15] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:20:17] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:20:19] received the spirit of adoption do you
[1:20:22] know your Bible enough to know that
[1:20:23] adoption was to the Jews he got brought
[1:20:29] over to you and I we're about you cry
[1:20:33] about father there's an adoption the
[1:20:35] Spirit bears witness with our spirit
[1:20:36] that we are the children of God and if
[1:20:39] children then heirs of God and
[1:20:40] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:20:43] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:20:45] glorified together now watch him for I
[1:20:48] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:20:50] present time are not worthy to be
[1:20:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:20:54] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:20:59] expectation of the creature the whole
[1:21:03] creation everything waiteth where these
[1:21:07] aren't explained agree waited for the
[1:21:08] manifestation of sons of God
[1:21:10] purge you second stage of adoption where
[1:21:13] the creature was made subject to vanity
[1:21:16] not willingly but by reason of him that
[1:21:19] suffered the same in hope because the
[1:21:21] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:21:23] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:21:25] glorious liberty of the children of God
[1:21:27] look how that nature is groaning crying
[1:21:31] you think it was wrong when that blew up
[1:21:35] my end up there walked out in the
[1:21:36] backyard and bumped a hornet's nest you
[1:21:43] know their story they all become runnin
[1:21:46] around him he said little Hornets I'm
[1:21:49] sorry go back to your home your net they
[1:21:55] just turned black walk out in the field
[1:22:00] where there was a killer blue the bull
[1:22:04] charging and I like the way he's takes
[1:22:07] time cuz he was human he said it I left
[1:22:09] my gun in the car now this is what he
[1:22:11] said
[1:22:11] see you think brother branham was this
[1:22:13] that or the other what did he say he
[1:22:15] said if I'd have had my gun out of
[1:22:16] killed it went paid for it now read the
[1:22:19] message he was human but he said
[1:22:23] something happened he said then he loved
[1:22:26] the bull then he said bull six years ago
[1:22:29] lay down the bull went over to lay down
[1:22:33] he said a walk within a few feet of him
[1:22:35] and walked out
[1:22:37] listen church Nature has met its master
[1:22:43] keep the Scriptures up brother Nature
[1:22:46] has met its master just for a minute
[1:22:50] it's met it and a lot of people a lot of
[1:22:51] people have done a lot of fight doing
[1:22:53] talk about the prophecy but what about
[1:22:56] this now I was a creature says he'll be
[1:22:58] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:23:00] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:23:01] children of God don't you think those
[1:23:03] animals would love for it to be back
[1:23:05] right what you think though the line
[1:23:10] would love to be back you know what the
[1:23:13] line when he's first born his way with
[1:23:17] some idea that he's a drinker is milk
[1:23:19] and you know until he becomes an eater
[1:23:22] of meat is when you got to be scared of
[1:23:25] it there's plenty of stories where lines
[1:23:28] and lambs are born and put together and
[1:23:32] raised up together and they're not
[1:23:33] dangerous
[1:23:36] because they've learned well we know
[1:23:40] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:23:41] travaileth pain together until now watch
[1:23:46] him now and not only they but ourselves
[1:23:50] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:23:53] spirit even we ourselves groan within
[1:23:55] ourselves waiting for the adoption
[1:24:01] to wit the redemption of the body have
[1:24:08] you ever looked up to wit I know you can
[1:24:12] go wit and widdy's and all this that
[1:24:13] kneel but look it up in the terminology
[1:24:16] of thinking about Christian when I say
[1:24:18] it this way where's that pain together
[1:24:22] until now waiting for the adoption to
[1:24:25] wit to understand to wit is to
[1:24:30] understand the redemption of the body
[1:24:34] there was nobody taught redemption of
[1:24:37] the body as a reality until this prophet
[1:24:41] came you so yeah Peter now
[1:24:44] yeah they quoted things Paul did too he
[1:24:47] said a lot of things but he never
[1:24:49] explained it the closest he got was when
[1:24:53] this quorum can be put on this and that
[1:24:54] could be put on that then can be said
[1:24:56] that which is that there he comes down
[1:24:59] to speak in his life statement to
[1:25:02] understand the redemption of our bodies
[1:25:07] that's what the statue of a perfect man
[1:25:09] is far to understand the redemption of
[1:25:15] the body
[1:25:17] you heard me make this statement so then
[1:25:20] it's not something that some new would
[1:25:23] say well brother Dale made a good
[1:25:25] statement or not no I made this 30 40
[1:25:27] years ago told when brother Branham said
[1:25:32] in the church age book messenger Malachi
[1:25:34] for Luke 17 30 would do two things
[1:25:38] one turn the hearts of the children back
[1:25:42] to the father he said it took him review
[1:25:45] read if you've read or listened to the
[1:25:48] statute of perfect man you heard him say
[1:25:50] that he preached thirty years before he
[1:25:54] could come to that place of that message
[1:25:58] you know why because he's waiting on
[1:26:00] somebody that could believe it well
[1:26:04] what's the second thing of the the two
[1:26:06] thing nationair malachi for luke 1730
[1:26:11] revelation 10 seven will do two things
[1:26:13] one turn the hearts of the children back
[1:26:14] to the faith of the five to reveal the
[1:26:18] thunders which is a revelation contained
[1:26:22] in the seven seals
[1:26:27] once everybody gets to see you they
[1:26:31] don't want to hear it they don't hear
[1:26:33] nobody preach on seals I invite you
[1:26:37] around the world any word or not not

[1:27:14] of hands but I'm going to ask you to be
[1:27:16] honest because most of you have said and
[1:27:18] listened to me for two years and could
[1:27:20] not tell how to get the faith of the
[1:27:25] virtuous yet you've listened to me for
[1:27:28] 40 years
[1:27:36] somebody tell me how do you get the
[1:27:40] virtues I want a scriptural answer I

[1:27:48] you that's a quote how do you get the
[1:27:52] virtues when we got to have them if you

[1:29:28] children back to the faith of the
[1:29:29] fathers he said to you reveal the
[1:29:31] thunders which is a revelation contained
[1:29:33] in the seventh seal and it will be these
[1:29:37] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:29:40] literally turn us back and there's the
[1:29:45] answer
[1:29:49] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:29:52] throughs that literally turn you back
[1:29:55] and you know what this thunders are the
[1:29:58] revelation containing the seventh seal
[1:29:59] well why is everybody against the seals
[1:30:01] oh we know all about it we know about to
[1:30:05] see us we know about all this we we wish
[1:30:08] that we're why horse rider that was once
[1:30:13] your prophet saying that it would take
[1:30:17] those seals to turn us back so they got
[1:30:20] it up now okay we got it
[1:30:25] 3:27 either way off on the patient right
[1:30:28] now this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[1:30:30] Revelation 2:10 7 is going to do two
[1:30:32] things one according to Malachi 4 you'll
[1:30:34] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:30:36] father's two he will reveal the
[1:30:38] mysteries
[1:30:39] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:30:42] which are the revelations contained in
[1:30:46] the seven seals it will be these
[1:30:49] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:30:52] literally turn the parts of the children
[1:30:56] to the Pentecostal father's he said
[1:30:59] exactly so but a lot of you have been
[1:31:03] here 40 years or a round at 3040 year
[1:31:09] you didn't pay attention are you paying
[1:31:15] attention now what if your life was at
[1:31:18] stake tonight on the basis of what you
[1:31:21] knew about to turn the hearts of the
[1:31:23] children to the Father
[1:31:24] it is what was you listening why does
[1:31:33] the people turn the seals down that's
[1:31:35] the one thing the people of this message
[1:31:37] fight more than anything except Daniel
[1:31:39] 70 weeks and I love the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:31:42] because brother Branham said if you
[1:31:45] don't understand Daniel 70 weeks now
[1:31:48] this is a quote right out of Daniels 70
[1:31:50] weeks message if you don't understand
[1:31:52] the Daniel 70 way you cannot understand
[1:31:55] the seals the vague plagues of vials and
[1:31:58] time and who wants to hear about Daniel
[1:32:03] 70 weeks
[1:32:09] come on you I told you I just open
[1:32:14] it up to a whole thing I show you what
[1:32:17] it takes it takes while they're coming
[1:32:19] it takes the word of god and the holy
[1:32:22] spirit to quicken that word to give us
[1:32:24] faith the new birth then we can only
[1:32:27] grow up the stature of a perfect man as
[1:32:29] the word is being revealed to us because
[1:32:34] the birth is the word the growth is the
[1:32:37] word the only way you'll ever come out
[1:32:40] to a change of the body is to know what
[1:32:44] those seals is taught cause the seals is
[1:32:46] for the redemption of the body Co didn't
[1:32:50] come to redeem a stowaway keep saying
[1:32:52] that over to why those are soul had
[1:32:56] already redeemed it was redeemed they're
[1:32:59] back are in the Bible you were deemed
[1:33:01] under their Pentecost
[1:33:04] all them didn't know nothing about the
[1:33:06] CEOs in the time he never mentioned it
[1:33:12] but everybody knows that nobody wants to
[1:33:17] listen they don't want to listen if
[1:33:25] somebody try to explain things
[1:33:31] they've already got it figured out
[1:33:34] that's all I've ever asked you the
[1:33:38] sincerity in my heart to cry out before
[1:33:41] God if you know how to get us to the
[1:33:43] statue of perfect man come and tell me

[1:36:43] he'd been here a little while and he
[1:36:45] talking to me one day about statue of
[1:36:47] perfect land and he said pop he said I'd
[1:36:52] never seen it he said brother Branham
[1:36:55] says in that book that we've got to have
[1:36:59] those verses so you know his pastor
[1:37:07] former let's do not have been preaching
[1:37:10] much about it
[1:37:16] if it's a requirement we've got to have
[1:37:18] it and if it's a requirement he has got
[1:37:21] to make a way for us to receive right
[1:37:26] and he has the message has already been
[1:37:29] delivered but why would people hate to
[1:37:35] even listen to some I talk about the
[1:37:37] seals it's scared to death
[1:37:43] they're scared to even think about
[1:37:45] things I don't say if I asked for a
[1:37:54] raise of hand men in this building had
[1:37:56] ever read the seal book how many of you
[1:38:03] have ever even listened to all of the
