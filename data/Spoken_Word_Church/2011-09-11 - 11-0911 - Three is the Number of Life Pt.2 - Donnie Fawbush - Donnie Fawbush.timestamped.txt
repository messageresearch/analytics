[0:00] Good morning.
[0:02] I hope everybody feels as good as I do
[0:05] this morning about being able just to
[0:07] get up. Amen. See all y'all again.
[0:10] This certainly is a joy in my life. It's
[0:13] a pleasant thing. Uh I just like to say
[0:16] a little prayer this morning. Y'all
[0:18] don't mind before we get started. I know
[0:20] sometimes you don't. I I love to do
[0:22] that. Y'all know I say a little prayer
[0:25] and thank the Lord for being here.
[0:26] Precious heavenly father, we want to
[0:28] thank you once again for allowing us all
[0:30] to be here together today in your house
[0:31] and come hear about you, Lord, and to
[0:34] this fellowship around your word, Father
[0:36] God. And I ask each for everyone here,
[0:39] Lord. Forgive us of our sins, Father
[0:41] God, because we sin every day. And Lord,
[0:44] you sent your word to heal us. Such a
[0:46] beautiful word and deliver us from our
[0:47] own destruction. And I appreciate that.
[0:50] And I ask Lord that all those people
[0:53] that's separated out there and and
[0:56] everything just touch them and bless
[0:58] them that all that are yours will come.
[0:59] And we believe your word. It says it
[1:01] will happen. And I believe it. And
[1:03] Father God, for me, the sooner the
[1:05] better. And I ask this day for those
[1:08] families that was lost in 9/11 that you
[1:10] just touch and bless them and continue
[1:11] to lift them up with understanding,
[1:14] Father God, and just bless them and be
[1:16] with them and each one. And I asked you
[1:19] today that our pastor's missing today.
[1:21] He's he's up at brother Wilson's. And I
[1:23] ask you just to bless him up there. And
[1:25] those people are certainly blessed to
[1:27] hear him bring your word as he does
[1:30] here. I ask you just to let him speak
[1:32] the words that's on his heart that you
[1:34] place there come across those lips. You
[1:36] made a clay. And father, anoint the ears
[1:38] up there that they can hear and
[1:39] understand and speak to their minds and
[1:42] let their hearts receive what you've
[1:43] sent them, Father God. And I ask you
[1:45] this morning to be with brother Wade and
[1:47] bless him as he's preparing to do two
[1:49] services today. Father, I was kind of
[1:52] whining a little bit about having to do
[1:54] this little 30 minutes down here for you
[1:56] today, but I thought about Brother Wade.
[1:59] You brought him to my remembrance, he's
[2:01] got two to do today. And as brother Dale
[2:03] does too, all the time, but it just
[2:05] takes a lot of work. And I know it does,
[2:06] Father. And I thank you for it and let
[2:08] me be there to be able to receive this.
[2:11] And I ask you, Lord, again, just to
[2:12] bless each one here today. Bless our
[2:14] fellowship with each other. Don't let us
[2:17] say anything or do anything to harm or
[2:18] hinder anybody in any way. Bring Brother
[2:20] Dale and Sister Dale home safely. Bless
[2:23] all the bride around the world and bless
[2:24] those that couldn't be here today. We
[2:27] ask these things and ask, Father, you
[2:28] just come down and bless the services
[2:30] here today. We ask these things in your
[2:32] precious name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:35] Amen. Uh I want to get started on
[2:38] something that I was speaking on last
[2:39] time. I love this thing, the number
[2:42] three. I love it because uh in the
[2:47] message of hear his voice,
[2:50] Jeffersonville, Indiana,
[2:52] uh brother Brandham
[2:56] says there are three stages of
[2:58] everything. There's a stage of mortal
[3:00] body, there's a stage of immortal body,
[3:02] and then there's the glorified body. See
[3:05] just like other things like father, son
[3:07] and holy spirit goes in one channel and
[3:10] the three makes the one. Justification,
[3:13] sanctification, baptism of the holy
[3:15] ghost in a channel makes the one and the
[3:18] soul body, soul and spirit makes the one
[3:22] and it travels in threes and threes are
[3:26] one. I think what he's trying to say
[3:28] there when you see that look at it as
[3:30] one and I think we all in here are
[3:33] educated enough know enough to do all
[3:35] that cuz that's the way we see it and
[3:37] that's the way we've been taught too
[3:39] thank God and make a three corner piece
[3:42] of glass and lay it in the sun it'll
[3:44] reflect colors yet seven colors and
[3:48] seven is the number that God uses to
[3:51] display itself but yet seven colors will
[3:55] come down to
[3:57] And you take red and look through red at
[4:00] red. How many knows that color? It'll be
[4:03] white. Oh, isn't that strange? That red
[4:06] through red looks white. Red is the sign
[4:08] of redemption. And when you God looks at
[4:11] your red sins through the blood of his
[4:14] precious son, they are white. See? So,
[4:18] but he has to look through the blood. If
[4:21] it doesn't, they aren't sinful. So, we
[4:24] have to be under the blood. I want to
[4:27] turn this morning to John
[4:32] 14:15. I'm sitting there talking a
[4:35] little bit last night with the Lord
[4:37] about what to do. And sometimes, you
[4:39] know, there's so many things pop in your
[4:41] head. I know brother Joe and anybody
[4:42] else is brother Boyd you have to you
[4:45] want to get up and speak and and uh when
[4:48] you're asked to do what you're supposed
[4:49] to do and uh the devil comes at you and
[4:52] says no you can't talk about that it's
[4:54] already been talked about you can't do
[4:55] this you can't do that because already
[4:57] been said I already know it well thank
[4:59] God I'm here and if I say anything wrong
[5:02] y'all can throw something at me and
[5:03] that's okay but I think the Lord will
[5:06] keep me straight on everything cuz I
[5:08] believe his word said if anytime we had
[5:10] anything like that that the comforter
[5:12] would be here and he would keep me out
[5:16] of trouble. Thank God. Anyway, we're
[5:18] going to read John
[5:20] 14:15. If you love me, keep my
[5:24] commandments. And I will pray thee the
[5:27] Father, and he will he shall give you
[5:30] another comforter, that he may abide
[5:34] with you forever, even the Spirit of
[5:36] truth, whom the world cannot receive,
[5:39] because it seeth him not. Neither
[5:42] knoweth him, nor ye know him. For he
[5:44] dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
[5:48] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[5:51] come to you yet a little while and the
[5:54] world see me no more. But ye see me
[5:57] because I live. Ye shall live
[6:01] also. And at that day ye shall know that
[6:06] I am in my father
[6:09] first and ye in me. It's the second
[6:13] pool and I in you third.
[6:17] Three. I love that.
[6:20] I really do. I love that. Uh I think we
[6:24] all need to see that that's the
[6:26] three-fold manner is there and I think
[6:28] we all do. Uh I want to go over here
[6:30] right now cuz I'm going uh want to speak
[6:33] on the rest just for a minute. I'm going
[6:36] to the Hebrews book. Uh let's see, page
[6:40] 150. I look down here
[6:43] 150. Okay, here we go. Now
[6:46] watch. That was the third rest. He gave
[6:50] that's when the Holy Ghost came
[6:52] himself. Let's see. I'm going to start
[6:54] up here. What is the rest? When did the
[6:57] rest come? When people spoke with other
[7:00] tongues had stammering lips. Stammering
[7:03] lips that they didn't speak nothing.
[7:05] They
[7:06] stammered. When did that happen? On the
[7:08] day of Pentecost. When did the Holy
[7:10] Ghost come? That is the rest. The Holy
[7:13] Ghost. Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye
[7:15] that are weary and heavy laden and I'll
[7:17] give you rest. I'll give you life,
[7:20] eternal life. Zoe, God's own life. God
[7:22] will come unto you and be a part of you.
[7:25] He will give you a birth and make you a
[7:28] son or daughter
[7:30] ord that was the third
[7:33] rest he gave. The first, God received it
[7:37] from his word. Second, Israel received
[7:40] it in the law. And third, the church
[7:43] received it as a part of God.
[7:47] I think we know where we're at here,
[7:48] right? Everybody in here. Amen.
[7:54] Three is the number of of life. How many
[7:57] knows that? Congratulations. Says,
[7:59] "Amen, Ed." Every time you see three,
[8:02] it's life. Notice when God created the
[8:04] earth, on the third day was life. How
[8:08] many knows that? Amen. The third day
[8:12] there came life. on the third day of
[8:15] creation. May need to go back and read
[8:17] that again. Y'all understand what I just
[8:18] read?
[8:20] Huh? Read it again. Okay, good idea.
[8:23] Says, "Read it again." The uh Hebrews
[8:26] book. Now watch. That was the third rest
[8:31] he gives. The first God received it.
[8:34] Where do you receive
[8:36] it? From
[8:38] creator, right? His attributes come
[8:41] forth creating that. All right, his
[8:45] work. Second, Israel received it in the
[8:48] law. Third, the church received it as a
[8:51] part of God. Three is the number of
[8:53] life. How many knows that? Congregation
[8:56] says, "Amen." Ed, every time you see
[8:58] three, it's life. Notice when God
[9:01] created the earth, on the third day was
[9:04] life. How many knows that? Amen. The
[9:07] third day there came life. On the third
[9:09] day of
[9:10] creation, the Trinity, the father was
[9:13] above the people in a pillar of fire.
[9:16] The son was a man who talked to the
[9:19] people and got them ready. The Holy
[9:22] Ghost was the third
[9:23] step which was the Holy Ghost, God, and
[9:27] the people, life, Father, and
[9:30] Son.
[9:34] Okay, I want to cover that on the rest.
[9:38] And let's see, I want to go to paragraph
[9:54] 86. Okay.
[10:01] And when you enter into the rest, you
[10:04] cease from your own worldly works like
[10:06] God did from his. Why? You're a part of
[10:09] God. You rest eternally. There you are.
[10:12] That's the Sabbath. Come unto me all ye
[10:15] that labor. Then we'll go to the fourth
[10:18] chapter 203.
[10:36] Uh justification came under Martin
[10:39] Luther still a form of religion.
[10:42] Sanctification he said Martin Luther but
[10:44] John Wesley the baptism of the Holy
[10:47] Ghost life justification is believing.
[10:51] Sanctification is the cleansing. Holy
[10:53] Ghost is a lifting is a filling life.
[10:57] Not through the Lutheran age. They had
[11:00] it in a form. Not through the Wesland
[11:03] age. They had it in a form. But in this
[11:06] age, the Holy Ghost comes himself.
[11:08] That's a point I wanted to bring out. Um
[11:10] it meant something to me to go back and
[11:13] hear that again because I I'd heard some
[11:15] uh some things uh listening to some the
[11:18] seals, Brother Dale Seals, that really
[11:20] didn't quite make sense to me. when I
[11:21] read this, it brings me back to about
[11:24] the trumpets and things. But
[11:26] nevertheless, I wanted to
[11:28] uh take us right there right quick on
[11:31] some things. And
[11:33] uh there's uh
[11:36] three forms of redemption or three big
[11:40] sections to the redemption. First is
[11:42] Gentile nations got to come. Then the
[11:45] Jewish 144,000's got to come. Then the
[11:48] earth's got to be redeemed. Uh I I I
[11:51] loved all that. I had to throw that in.
[11:53] That one ain't no extra charge, but I
[11:56] wanted to go here with this to we have
[11:59] found him and
[12:02] see then he's here. Is that right? He
[12:05] said whenever two or three are gathered,
[12:08] no matter how small a group, two or
[12:10] three, it'll be in the I'll be in their
[12:14] midst. What anything they ask shall
[12:18] receive it. Now, that's either right or
[12:20] wrong. Jesus said, "If you abide in me
[12:22] and my word in you, you can ask what you
[12:26] will, it will be done." Whatsoever
[12:28] things you desire when you pray, believe
[12:30] you receive it. That's but watch the
[12:33] order of the word now. You believe now,
[12:36] you receive it. It shall be given to you
[12:39] tonight. See, he can't do anything for
[12:43] you until you first believe it. And he
[12:46] said he say and say he has done it. In
[12:49] other words, you got to believe it and
[12:51] say, "Amen. Thank you, Lord. I know it's
[12:53] done." That's right. Let
[12:57] me that. Soak. He said, "Let just soak
[12:59] it up." It's kind of deep.
[13:03] Um, I got one more right here. I wanted
[13:06] to
[13:07] uh take you
[13:10] to one more scripture and then I'm going
[13:13] to ramble a little while I think going
[13:18] to John 15:7. I'm going to go back to
[13:20] John 15:7 cuz I love that scripture
[13:23] right there. And this is exactly what he
[13:25] just said. And listen, I I'm not y'all
[13:29] know me. I can't stand up here and quote
[13:31] you scriptures and like some people can
[13:33] sit there and eat your life with
[13:35] scriptures. I can't do it. When trouble
[13:38] abounds, you have to stop and think when
[13:40] when a seven sudden sudden Satan is
[13:42] sitting up there knocking on your head
[13:44] saying, "Hey, you got to do things
[13:46] good." You know what? All I woke up at
[13:49] 4:30. Sure. Wednesday morning. Boy knows
[13:52] what I'm talking about. Brother John
[13:53] know what I'm talking about. And let me
[13:55] tell you, you can say it's your mind
[13:57] organizing up here this stuff, but what
[13:59] wakes you up and organizes this
[14:01] old melting pot. He does. And he'll sit
[14:05] there and I wish sometimes I could plug
[14:07] a recorder in the side of my head and
[14:09] pick this stuff up and remember it. But
[14:11] we're not supposed to do that because
[14:13] we'll get so jumbled up like I do. And
[14:16] I'm trying not to right now, but Lord,
[14:18] but you know, you stop and think about
[14:20] these things and and you walk through
[14:22] life and you see these things coming up.
[14:24] you see two people arguing you and
[14:26] what's the first thought or something
[14:27] hits
[14:28] you first thing that happens to most of
[14:31] us me is they go
[14:33] oh little fear hits
[14:37] you first thing that should hit us is
[14:39] like when Satan took Jesus up on that
[14:43] mountain and said this is all your
[14:45] kingdom all of them he didn't stump he
[14:49] didn't do nothing he just said it is
[14:50] written
[14:52] it is written He didn't he didn't have
[14:55] no faults except one
[14:57] thought. That was his
[14:59] word.
[15:01] Now, we all know that I'm not that
[15:04] strong. But the same one that told him
[15:08] his flesh body to obey that was in him
[15:12] that's in me and all of us here. And I
[15:15] think a lot of times for me, I have a
[15:18] tendency to be like Eve and want to fix
[15:20] it myself, right?
[15:23] You do you have to stop and think when
[15:25] these things come up. That's right. I
[15:26] was talking to my grandson this morning.
[15:29] You you about things you have to watch
[15:31] what is put on your table. That's right.
[15:34] No matter what it is, family situations,
[15:39] uh mothers, daughters, brothers,
[15:42] sisters, children, grandchildren, you
[15:44] you have to watch the results of what
[15:46] happens and we have to call it on the
[15:48] word. That's right. And for
[15:51] me, I love this right here. When I pray,
[15:53] you'll hear me a lot of times say this
[15:56] because I firmly believe it. What part
[15:59] of it I can uh when I first come over
[16:02] here, I used to say that uh honor thy
[16:05] father and mother as I would thy father
[16:06] in heaven. Well, I said that about two
[16:09] or three times around here. The wrong
[16:11] ears hurting, but I won't say the wrong
[16:13] ears. The right ears hurting. And called
[16:15] me off to the side very patiently. Papa
[16:17] did. He said, "Come here." He said, "It
[16:20] don't say it like that. It says it like
[16:22] this. It's in the scripture and it says
[16:24] it exactly like this. Thy days will be
[16:27] lengthened." That's right. You know,
[16:30] okay. You know, just kind of keep your
[16:33] mouth shut until you know what you're
[16:35] talking about. But the part of it God
[16:37] right here is this. I I I really love
[16:40] this scripture. Oh, I love all the
[16:42] scripture, but the ones that come to my
[16:44] mind in trouble is by his stripes I'm
[16:46] healed. That's my first one. It hits me
[16:48] just like that. Whatever comes up in the
[16:50] situation, u we have a little sometimes
[16:53] in the mornings we have a little thing
[16:56] with my brother Tommy. He likes to get
[16:58] everybody stirred up real good. Kind of
[17:00] like daddy did, you know, bring them up
[17:01] real good, stir them up. And you'll hear
[17:04] me upstairs. And of course, Sue, she's
[17:06] wanting to get him straight and get him
[17:08] going and head him out cuz she loves
[17:09] him. And and uh he has just been playful
[17:13] sometimes, you know, telling family
[17:14] stuff and it's okay. We're all family.
[17:16] Sure. Amen. But it happens, right?
[17:18] Listen, and I love him. He's my brother.
[17:22] God put me here with him for a reason,
[17:25] and I'd love that. I think I'm the lucky
[17:28] person. Okay. U But anyway, I just I
[17:32] have to say, peace be still.
[17:38] And you have to because listen,
[17:40] sometimes listen, it's not only home.
[17:43] It's at work.
[17:45] We we do constantly. We're natural
[17:48] constant uh enemies really. I don't
[17:52] know. I know in the ways of the world,
[17:54] used car dealers and mechanics don't get
[17:56] along. They really don't. Used car
[17:59] dealers, you know, uh they're just
[18:01] trying to make a living and mechanics,
[18:04] they won't replace
[18:05] everything. So, you know, it's the way
[18:07] it works. But there ain't one that can
[18:10] make all that work, right? Is my point.
[18:13] And my point is today we having him in
[18:16] word form has been presented be before
[18:19] us and we have a preacher that has been
[18:22] sent by the grace of God to show y'all
[18:27] me the word that I may know these things
[18:31] by his revelation. Now I I had a friend
[18:35] that was a Methodist and he would just
[18:37] he he he would he would go on and on and
[18:39] on about the grace. you don't think
[18:41] God's grace is sufficient for this. Uh,
[18:44] you know, it's okay that I went and rode
[18:45] my bike and I settled on the side. I had
[18:47] me a beer. I said, "No, it's not okay.
[18:50] There's a time and place for everything,
[18:52] right? God taught so much that he did
[18:56] everything by his times for a reason for
[19:00] us to follow that example." And it I
[19:03] used to think when I was younger that,
[19:05] you know, you as a Christian, just going
[19:06] to church all the time. Well, you didn't
[19:08] go get to do the fun things, hang out
[19:10] late at night and get in trouble. And,
[19:12] you know, somebody was always pitching
[19:14] me in the middle of a ring to try to
[19:16] fight somebody or something, you know,
[19:17] and I'd get I'd settle that situation
[19:20] most of the time. Thank the Lord without
[19:21] any problems. Then I'd turn and find
[19:23] that boy that set me up to do this. I'd
[19:26] run him all the way to the house with my
[19:28] belt, you know. But I used to think I
[19:32] really did when I was out in the world
[19:33] that
[19:38] uh I would not go to the point I'm not
[19:41] stupid, okay? I'm not going against the
[19:44] Lord the wrong way here. I would just
[19:46] stay away from it. I would hide like
[19:48] like uh you know, get behind the bushes
[19:51] over there. God can't see me, but he
[19:53] sees everything. You know, it's like,
[19:54] okay, I'm hiding from God like this. And
[19:57] uh but you know, he's going to have his
[20:00] way.
[20:01] And of course, we all know that's his
[20:04] will. And his word says, "I'm coming."
[20:08] Now, we understand that I'm coming means
[20:11] what does come mean? We've been taught.
[20:14] He's here. Every one of us here. He's
[20:17] here. Okay. Now, let me go back to
[20:20] reading my I want to read my scripture
[20:22] because I kind of want to talk a little
[20:23] bit
[20:24] u a little bit more here. John 15:7. If
[20:29] you abide in me and my words abide in
[20:33] you, ye shall ask what ye will and it
[20:38] shall be done unto you. Amen.
[20:43] Now, that's a promise that God has given
[20:46] me. That's I wrote a promise. I wrote it
[20:48] this my word. It's my promise. This is
[20:50] mine. But I want to talk a little bit
[20:53] this morning uh on on some things about
[20:58] sin and
[21:00] uh of course naturally what type of
[21:04] people we are. I want to read this and
[21:06] um it's called this questions and
[21:08] answers Hebrews part one Jeffersonville
[21:12] uh cood Wednesday 570925
[21:17] um
[21:19] 229112. Now let me have something here
[21:22] just show you a little something so you
[21:25] won't forget it. Going to make you a
[21:28] little illustration. I'm going to put
[21:31] how
[21:32] many gender nationalities of people are
[21:35] there in the world. There's three Ham,
[21:38] Sham, and Japan's people. How many knows
[21:40] that we come from those three sons of
[21:44] Noah. Ham's people, Sham's people,
[21:46] Japan's people is the
[21:49] Anglo-Saxon. She's people is the the
[21:52] three generations. That's Jew, Gentile,
[21:56] and have Jew and Gentile.
[21:59] Now notice when there and this is Ham
[22:02] Shem and Ham and
[22:06] Japan. Uh y'all know that right? Jew
[22:11] gentile in the mixture. All right.
[22:14] There's three types that I kind of want
[22:15] to touch on. I don't know how deep I'm
[22:17] going to be able to get on, but I I do
[22:18] want to speak on and I want to see where
[22:21] we all come into this and to
[22:23] understanding. Uh want to talk a little
[22:25] bit this morning about three types of
[22:28] believers. The believer, the unbeliever,
[22:30] and the makebeliever. Um now that we
[22:33] know that there's three types of people,
[22:35] there's three types of believers that
[22:36] follow it also. And uh I just want to
[22:40] from my standpoint, the other night,
[22:42] Brother Dale was preaching on sin. It
[22:43] really struck my heart. And I don't know
[22:46] how God deals with y'all, but I'm sure
[22:48] it's the same way he deals with me. How
[22:50] many times have you heard a certain word
[22:55] that promotes or projects God to you and
[22:58] you only receive it in the mind and not
[23:01] down here where it belongs? How many
[23:03] times me I say here and I listen and I
[23:06] listen and I listen and I want to get
[23:08] everything brother Dale says I want to
[23:10] go through the hole get it all but I
[23:13] can't because it's too much. I just
[23:14] can't do it. I uh get up there and I I
[23:18] just go well the other night he was
[23:20] sitting there and it just went like a
[23:22] brain crust in my head and went to my
[23:23] heart and I just wanted to do back flips
[23:25] all down the pews because he said you
[23:27] never
[23:29] was. It's not your fault the way you was
[23:32] born. You was born
[23:35] perfect spouse born from your mother's
[23:37] womb a liar and you came out perfect.
[23:40] How does that happen?
[23:43] Well, we all know that God's in charge
[23:45] of all the souls. They're his. All souls
[23:47] are his, right? They're perfect. Okay.
[23:51] That's the part that we come back to
[23:53] right here after we for me that I went
[23:57] out into the world. That soul never left
[23:59] me. It was there. Mhm. Okay. I was in
[24:02] the stage of I'd say an
[24:05] unbeliever cuz I was. I believed him.
[24:09] Now I know how much I
[24:12] really and I'm sorry. I'd have to tell
[24:15] God, let's see my angel I'm going to
[24:18] have to It's going to be a long time to
[24:20] be able to repent to him and tell him
[24:22] I'm sorry. But it only takes one time,
[24:24] right? Amen. Cuz all you got to do is
[24:26] say, "God, I'm sorry for my repentant
[24:28] heart." And he'll hear you. But here's
[24:30] what happens to a lot of folks and sin.
[24:36] uh we come in this thing and we're we're
[24:38] bounced right out here into this cursed
[24:41] condition of the earth. You think about
[24:44] that for a minute. You didn't have no
[24:46] choice. I don't care what you born.
[24:49] Black, white, red, green, yellow,
[24:50] whatever you you come to right out here
[24:54] just like all of us
[24:55] did. God chose that pattern that we all
[25:00] come this way. He is the one that
[25:04] created the creation that brought us
[25:05] here. So, we bounce right out into this
[25:08] world that's cursed, this earth. You're
[25:10] going to trip, stumble, and fall. Right.
[25:13] We all are.
[25:16] It's not a good thing, but it's what
[25:17] happens. That's right. But when you come
[25:19] to that
[25:21] age and you feel that
[25:24] pull, if you don't get it straight right
[25:28] there and end with God, wherever you're
[25:31] at, whatever you're doing, get it
[25:32] straight with him right there and then
[25:34] cuz between you and him, then you can
[25:38] move on in his word and just Lord, you
[25:41] lead these feet. Wherever you put them
[25:44] is where I'll go. And that's my
[25:47] testimony to y'all today. He put me
[25:49] here, right? I told Brother Dale, I'm
[25:51] sorry. God sent me to you. He said you
[25:54] would do certain things. I'm sorry I put
[25:57] gray hairs in your head. But he did. He
[26:00] said, you come here and I'm here. Thank
[26:03] God. And I have received. I'm going to
[26:05] tell you all that. Nothing else. I got a
[26:07] lot of understanding up here. And I wish
[26:10] it all just fall, but it don't do that
[26:12] way. That's right. Okay. All you need is
[26:16] the faith. the rest of it add to your
[26:19] faith just keeps coming and keeps
[26:21] coming. We all know that. But I wanted
[26:23] to make a point here that
[26:32] uh that just as he did in Genesis when
[26:37] he brought the creation it's if you'll
[26:40] look it's the third
[26:44] chapter back to the three and in that
[26:47] third chapter a lot of things happens
[26:50] that's grace because the third chapter
[26:53] is where the fall is the sin. That's
[26:55] where we fail.
[26:57] We all know that that's where the
[26:58] promise the seed cometh into the world.
[27:02] And that's a wonderful
[27:04] thing. I like the part Genesis 3 cuz the
[27:10] other two had to deal with the creation
[27:13] and Genesis 1:26 27. That's what kicked
[27:16] it all off for me right there when he
[27:19] that was something that I for me that
[27:21] part of this message that I love that
[27:24] I've heard has has helped me so much to
[27:28] understand
[27:30] that in
[27:32] God he don't see my sins
[27:37] because if I got something on
[27:39] me something that I have a problem with
[27:42] and trust me devil tries to stir it up
[27:44] all the
[27:46] But all you got to do is say, "I love
[27:48] him. I remember where I come from.
[27:52] By his stripes, I'm healed."
[27:56] And the last thing
[27:59] that I just want to remind y'all of that
[28:02] if person has got something or you got
[28:04] something on your heart, get rid of it.
[28:07] Get rid of it. If it ain't of God, it
[28:10] don't belong there. That's his. That
[28:13] heart belongs to him. is his.
[28:17] And I tell you what he'll do. He'll let
[28:20] you make the decision cuz he is fair and
[28:23] a true judge. He's fair. He's honest.
[28:26] He's everything that I want and ain't.
[28:30] But by his stripes again, I'm healed
[28:33] from the inside out.
[28:36] Don't take nothing too long because you
[28:39] can come to a place to where you sear
[28:41] your grace away.
[28:44] There comes a point like it was with
[28:46] Esau that if you hold on to these bad
[28:51] things in trouble,
[28:54] you can sear away your grace, no matter
[28:56] how much Esau would try to repent, he
[28:58] never could hit the right button. And
[29:01] it's because he just seared it away. He
[29:05] pushed it aside and kept pushing it
[29:06] aside and pushing it aside. And I would
[29:09] pray that nobody in here should have
[29:11] that problem. But in case you see it and
[29:15] the spirits that you run into out there
[29:17] in the world, know these things. And
[29:20] just like some of the sisters you see
[29:22] that's walk through Walmart or brothers,
[29:25] you can say, "Lord, forgive them. That's
[29:27] what I do. That's my sister. That's my
[29:29] brother. Forgive them." Used to, I'd
[29:31] say, "Wow, put some clothes on. Go over
[29:34] there and get you a sheet and wrap up."
[29:36] But they don't know. They don't know.
[29:40] You can't judge them for what they don't
[29:42] know. We're the blessed people. We've
[29:45] heard the words.
[29:47] We got to become the word. But we got to
[29:50] I got to get it in me before I can
[29:52] become anything. Right. But anyway, I
[29:55] just wanted to talk to you a little bit
[29:57] about that this morning. And I hope you
[29:59] all enjoyed it. Got something from it.
[30:01] Wait a minute. Brother Lord, you pulled
[30:02] something out. I don't mean to cut
[30:04] anybody. She said, "If we love, if ye
[30:08] love me, keep my commandments." 1 John
[30:11] 3:6 uh 22, it says, "And whosoever we
[30:16] ask, and whatsoever we ask, we receive
[30:18] of him because we keep his commandments,
[30:21] we do those things that are pleasing in
[30:23] his sight." And this is his commandment
[30:26] that we should believe on the name of
[30:28] the his son, Jesus Christ, love one
[30:31] another as he gave us his commandment.
[30:35] and he that keepeth his commandments
[30:36] dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby
[30:39] we know that we abide that he abide in
[30:42] us and by the spirit which he has given
[30:45] us. You know over here in chapter 5 of
[30:48] first John it says whoever believeth in
[30:50] Jesus Christ is born of God and everyone
[30:53] that loveth him begott loveth him also
[30:56] begotten of him. By this we know that we
[31:00] love the children of God. And when we
[31:01] love God, we keep his commandments. If
[31:05] you read on down through there in verse
[31:06] seven, bottom line, you'll find out that
[31:11] that's where you find out you're a son
[31:12] of God. That's right. And his
[31:13] commandments right there. Amen. And it
[31:16] all starts right there. Believe it on
[31:17] him by his faith. And his commandment is
[31:19] his word. Amen. Bless y'all. Let's go uh
[31:24] listen to the message that God has
[31:26] prepared for us this morning. Right
[31:28] away.
