[23:37] I've been asking sister julienne nyla
[23:42] well maybe not nyla but I asked Trudy to

[23:48] Crowder sings though yeah it's been two
[23:50] years I'll get to that the song has been
[23:53] out a couple of years my Christian men
[23:55] and crowd or not it and I really

[24:04] my hope is in Jesus we have no other
[24:06] hope without without Jesus Christ so I

[28:23] had times like this we've never had
[28:25] where we have to adjust and we're gonna
[28:27] have to adjust next Sunday because what
[28:29] happened was we had a bunch of people in
[28:31] my Sunday school class
[28:33] waiting for the small Sunday School
[28:35] classes to get finished well we're gonna
[28:38] take sister Monica's class and put it in
[28:39] my Sunday school class next Sunday all
[28:42] right she knows that so most of you
[28:44] don't need to know it but you can the
[28:45] ones you that come here that want to sit
[28:48] downstairs you can come into the big
[28:50] area next Sunday and be able to sit down
[28:52] there first
[28:53] instead of crowding up in my Sunday
[28:55] School class and that's my that's my
[28:57] fault I apologize all right so thank you
[29:00] everyone for being patient thank you
[29:02] everyone for coming thank you everyone
[29:03] for trying to do the best we can we
[29:06] still want to do the social distancing
[29:08] we still we don't practice it outside
[29:10] but we probably need to but just make
[29:14] sure you keep your hands washing and
[29:16] look out for the older people bro Kali
[29:20] this building has not been the same
[29:21] without you buddy and I mean that from
[29:23] the bottom of my heart
[29:24] I mean that from the bottom of my heart
[29:28] brother Kylie were he sitting at this
[29:31] moment that didn't exist when he first
[29:34] started coming to church here brother
[29:37] Tom the the building was like this the
[29:39] door was right there and that was a wall
[29:41] and the pulpit was right here and piano
[29:44] was right here and the little seat
[29:45] theater seats were right here that
[29:47] wasn't a door there that was in 1971 so
[29:50] we've come a long way from there and we
[29:53] love each and every one of you so that's
[29:56] turn in our Bibles I think that's about
[29:58] got it 2 Corinthians we've been speaking
[30:02] on the book of Esther we might get
[30:04] finished today if we don't we'll finish
[30:05] next Sunday I love the book of Esther
[30:09] it's one of the greatest books in the
[30:11] Bible because I can I can see my journey
[30:14] I can see all the characters just as we
[30:17] did in the Book of Ruth we can see those
[30:20] characters but we're going to read in
[30:21] Corinthians 10 verse 11 to get an
[30:26] example I'm sorry first first
[30:28] corinthians they'll pull it up on the
[30:30] screen here in just a second but we'll
[30:32] have it probably if we get finished I
[30:36] told brother Dale the other day or
[30:37] yesterday we were talking about stuff
[30:39] and I want to I want to try to go back
[30:41] over the feast days again so if you want
[30:43] to kind of get your mind wrapped around
[30:46] that a little bit because the feast days
[30:47] are to Israel we know that for a fact
[30:49] but it does have implications to you and
[30:52] I because it's the spiritual part
[30:53] there's seven feast days that actually
[30:56] fits just like all these book of Esther
[30:58] Book of Ruth all these were given for
[31:00] example those feast days we're not just
[31:02] for Israel only because we're spiritual
[31:05] Israel we have a Passover we have a
[31:07] firstfruits we have a right we have a
[31:11] ingathering we have a day of atonement
[31:14] but you see we don't have a day when
[31:17] Jesus come he said it's not a day now
[31:20] the day of the Lord is not one day it's
[31:25] a period of time and we know for a fact
[31:28] that the first four feasts were
[31:30] fulfilled by Jesus Christ but the other
[31:33] three feast have to be fulfilled by the
[31:35] bride okay so we'll get
[31:38] into that and those first four feasts
[31:40] were in April in April in May in two
[31:42] different places and then now the last
[31:44] three feasts are gonna be in like around
[31:46] October so we'll see how that God will
[31:50] show us something if we will pay
[31:52] attention that man so first Corinthians
[31:54] 10 sorry to keep you standing but
[31:56] they'll keep you awake a little bit
[31:58] longer let's bow our heads the Heavenly
[32:02] Father thank you Lord for this day thank
[32:04] you for the testimony that we can give
[32:06] of somebody like brother Colley and
[32:09] different ones that's been here Lord for
[32:10] forty some odd years Lord in standing at
[32:13] the post of duty in and to see them back
[32:15] again Lord it's just it's like I was
[32:18] thinking the other day it's just like
[32:20] David when the Ark of the Covenant was
[32:23] in a different country and God told him
[32:27] to go get it and bring it back to Israel
[32:29] my he danced he danced the dance he was
[32:32] so happy and Lord I'm so happy to see
[32:35] your bride coming back together this
[32:38] church coming back together and
[32:39] fulfilling the passage of scripture that
[32:42] says forsake not the assembling of
[32:44] yourself together and lord I pray that
[32:47] you'd be with us today in a special way
[32:49] not be a bystander but Lord be the
[32:51] active participant in this service you
[32:53] do the speaking you do the revealing
[32:56] father we pray that you'd just be with
[32:57] us give us strength bless the ones that
[33:00] are sick give the missionaries Lord in
[33:02] the foreign fields give them fruit for
[33:04] their labour father bless your little
[33:05] bride all around the world Lord I ask
[33:08] again Lord that you stay this plague
[33:10] this all over the world Lord that
[33:11] because now truly the whole world is
[33:13] groaning and waiting for the
[33:14] manifestation of the sons of God we pray
[33:17] this you to be with us now and to
[33:18] further Melissa service in Jesus name we
[33:19] pray amen
[33:21] I want you to get if you don't get
[33:23] anything else get one thing's for sure
[33:24] everything that was written everything
[33:27] that was done everything that was
[33:31] portrayed out in these people was for
[33:34] your benefit and mine
[33:36] naca nominal world not anybody out there
[33:40] yes they're gonna be a cause and effect
[33:42] of what's going on we see that now but
[33:44] everything in this Bible was written for
[33:47] me and you for our example all right
[33:49] let's go to the very last scripture
[33:51] saved
[33:52] now all these things happened unto them
[33:55] for example these talking about Moses
[33:57] and all the different ones and they are
[33:59] written for our admonition upon whom the
[34:02] ends of the world are come
[34:04] now how specific is that because the
[34:07] Corinthians were not looking at the end
[34:08] of the world we are we're looking right
[34:13] at the end of the world it's already
[34:15] begun the end has begun you may be
[34:19] seated in the Lord that is blessing to
[34:20] the reading of the word now if you'll
[34:23] just for a little background for for
[34:26] brother Tom and sister Rebecca just for
[34:28] a second we've been going through the
[34:29] journey of Abraham we've been going
[34:31] through the journey of Ruth but we
[34:33] titled this the journey of a believer
[34:35] and we're on part 13 and we noticed that
[34:38] that in in these journeys we see four
[34:43] parts and each one of the journeys we
[34:45] see the four parts and we put them up
[34:47] here because the prophet of God told us
[34:48] he said even in when he was preaching
[34:52] the future home he said I taught the
[34:56] three works of grace since a child and
[34:58] I've not deviated one iota so we must
[35:02] believe as believers as the believers we
[35:06] must believe in the three works of grace
[35:08] justification sanctification of baptism
[35:10] of the Holy Ghost not that you believe
[35:12] this message the devil believes it
[35:16] he just can't manifest it you and I can
[35:20] but then also remember we come to the
[35:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new
[35:25] birth and we see that that's what's
[35:28] required and that's what's been required
[35:32] down to the church ages until this age
[35:35] no one has been required to take a body
[35:39] change to go from Mortal to immortal
[35:45] while they're on the earth so we see
[35:49] that there was a fourth stage we we know
[35:52] that if we look at your types and we're
[35:54] going to see in the book of Esther
[35:55] threes and sevens but we know there's a
[35:58] four comes in there and then a lot of
[35:59] people before is an antichrist number
[36:02] but you've got to you've got to bring
[36:04] into redemption
[36:06] that if the that if the four beasts are
[36:10] for bugs eat the tree down as in the
[36:13] bride tree brother Brown said what it
[36:15] was a pummel worm canker caterpillar and
[36:17] locusts ate the tree down there had to
[36:20] be for life messengers bring that tree
[36:22] by God and we know the for combat beasts
[36:25] are the four messengers with a lion the
[36:27] Ox the man and the Eagle so we see that
[36:31] it's this Eagle Aegis where we're in so
[36:34] we can go higher we can be I don't say
[36:39] more revelaed
[36:40] but we've got more word available to us
[36:43] because we're required to go up this
[36:45] statue of a perfect man it's not a
[36:47] suggestion like the ten commandments the
[36:50] ten commandments are not a suggestion
[36:51] they're our requirement so as we come to
[36:54] the end time brother Brown did not come
[36:56] to bring us a new new birth he did not
[37:03] he can't bring us anything outside the
[37:05] Bible so he brought us what was already
[37:09] what had been hid down through the ages
[37:11] through the through the times and man
[37:13] our own ideas had covered it up and then
[37:18] now you come up to the end time and and
[37:21] you say well it's just believing the
[37:23] message no it's not it's making that
[37:28] word live in your life it's making that
[37:30] message to live in your heart but we
[37:33] believe according to the prophets
[37:35] message that we don't stop here it's
[37:38] like a brand-new baby you got a
[37:40] brand-new baby oh it's wonderful the
[37:42] baby's alive the babies the babies
[37:44] crying the baby's drinking milk but all
[37:46] of a sudden you take that baby prettiest
[37:48] baby in the world
[37:50] and put that baby in the closet
[37:52] somewhere it's still a baby it's still a
[37:55] human but if you don't feed it it's
[37:59] gonna die if you don't feed it it will
[38:02] die I'll promise you so that's what God
[38:05] wants us to do in the end time because
[38:08] even through the journey of Abraham
[38:10] we've seen we see all these positions
[38:13] because you come to to justification
[38:15] where what Abraham had to make a
[38:17] decision
[38:19] got called many people but Abraham
[38:22] responded and said I'll go alright same
[38:26] way with me in you same way with Ruth
[38:28] right in Ruth's first part she had to
[38:30] make a decision there was or fine that
[38:33] was Ruth Ruth the type of the bride or
[38:36] the type of the denominational Church
[38:39] though she didn't go on with God she
[38:41] went what back to her old denominational
[38:43] world but Ruth decided Abraham or Abram
[38:48] decided you and I must decide it's still
[38:53] free moral agency folks it's not just
[38:54] that you are a Christian and you just
[38:57] dropped on top of your head why did the
[38:59] Bible say this was all given for our
[39:01] example especially from the wins in the
[39:04] end of the world has come upon so we see
[39:07] that brother branham taught us all these
[39:09] three stages we see Abram and Abraham
[39:11] coming through this stage Ruth serving
[39:14] going through the going through the
[39:17] harvest and gleaning what gleaning what
[39:19] the preachers left for amen then you see
[39:23] that now remember we come to this spot
[39:27] here and we see that Abraham come to a
[39:30] place to where God accepted his faith
[39:33] member we read those quotes God accepted
[39:37] Abraham's faith turned him a new name
[39:39] giving the name Abraham and then he
[39:43] circumcised himself but he was
[39:46] circumcised as a type of God accepting
[39:50] his faith type of the baptism of the
[39:52] holy ghost same thing with you and I we
[39:54] have to have this circumcised the
[39:56] circumcision of our heart but now
[39:59] remember Abraham had one more step
[40:04] so did Ruth Ruth was resting root Boaz
[40:08] comes up he takes his shoe off he said I
[40:10] have bought I have bought Naomi's
[40:15] possession and he gets Ruth right all
[40:18] right so there's three stages three
[40:20] stages but we see when there's one more
[40:22] because remember there was a marriage
[40:26] and the conception there was a marriage
[40:30] and a conception
[40:32] there was a marriage and a conception
[40:36] they had a baby Isaac but 12 years later
[40:40] God brought Abraham to a place and said
[40:43] now take that boy up and kill him he
[40:47] wanted to see and place him just like
[40:51] we're placed now an adoption same way
[40:52] was with Ruth what was rewarded with
[40:55] Ruth was rewarded with Boaz being her
[40:59] husband and them having a child and
[41:01] taking that child and giving it to Naomi
[41:04] and then same way with you and I you and
[41:08] I must what well it's great to be born
[41:10] again it's great to be under the the
[41:12] power of the Holy Ghost but God wants a
[41:15] mature Christian he wants somebody with
[41:18] some maturity he don't want to have to
[41:19] bottle-feed us this church not been
[41:25] bottle-fed God didn't give me these
[41:28] teeth up here to chew milk with he gave
[41:32] me incisors and he gave me canines that
[41:34] you meet with a man so that's what we
[41:38] have here we have we're just were meat
[41:40] eaters
[41:40] I love the meat of the word and man I
[41:43] love the meat of the word because it's
[41:45] in our journey it's a continuation then
[41:48] God give us the Holy Ghost which had all
[41:50] four of the combat beasts the lion ox
[41:53] man and the eagle so where's the eagle
[41:55] the eagle is higher than anywhere else
[41:57] any other any other animal if you look
[42:01] and see as we've always said before the
[42:03] lion is very strong very powerful but
[42:06] he's only about this tall if he gets in
[42:09] grass about this tall well Tommy can't
[42:11] see very far but yet he's powerful that
[42:14] was the same that was what the word was
[42:15] the word was powerful in the first three
[42:17] church ages but they just couldn't see
[42:19] any further the ox was white a little
[42:22] bit taller but he wasn't he wasn't he
[42:24] didn't eat things he was of what he's a
[42:27] beast of burden through the through the
[42:29] dark ages he was a beast of burden all
[42:31] right then the man here we are standing
[42:33] a little bit taller and we got more
[42:34] intelligence anybody got me amen but the
[42:39] eagle can go high and look this way this
[42:43] way this way in this way they look
[42:44] higher than any other animal
[42:46] you can't go any higher than that so
[42:50] here we are in the Eagle Age and we'll
[42:54] see that we've come to a place that
[42:55] let's go ahead and skip all the way
[42:57] through to if you want to follow it
[42:59] being the book of Esther you can take
[43:01] your book out our will you can go ahead
[43:03] and and pull up Esther where it says
[43:06] King because each one had there's a
[43:09] character we know that there's a
[43:12] character in each one of these where
[43:13] Ruth you had Ruth was the was the bride
[43:16] or Foe was the denominational Church the
[43:20] old Jewish church was Naomi and Boaz
[43:23] type of Christ everybody got that same
[43:25] man should have because we've already
[43:27] been through this all right but see the
[43:29] book of Esther is the same way there's a
[43:31] king involved in this Kings not just the
[43:33] king of Rhode Island he's not just the
[43:37] king of Lulla Georgia this king rules
[43:40] from India all the way to Asia Asia
[43:46] Minor all the way across over into Rome
[43:49] in all the different places of the Medes
[43:51] and Persians so this King was a mighty
[43:53] king king of Soros he was not just like
[43:56] I said he wasn't just somebody that just
[43:58] well you know we who are you know
[44:01] everybody knew who he was
[44:03] so that King we're going to type in the
[44:05] book of Esther that King type - the king
[44:09] himself King Jesus King God whatever you
[44:12] want to call him Esther then is going to
[44:14] type the bride of Jesus Christ - die is
[44:18] going to type the church we know that
[44:20] because what did she do she refused
[44:23] further 'men of the word then Mordecai
[44:25] Mordecai is a little man he's going to
[44:29] portray a prophet that comes into the
[44:32] scene and he has a very very huge impact
[44:38] on Esther alright and her development
[44:40] and then we have Haman which is the
[44:44] devil and we're gonna look at Heyman
[44:46] even Haman's natural lineage takes him
[44:48] back to that so let's go to the book of
[44:50] Esther and let's read a few things that
[44:53] we're gonna we're gonna fly through this
[44:54] pretty good because we had it last last
[44:57] weekend
[44:59] because it's it's rather a long story
[45:03] simply because you've got so many
[45:05] players and you know what our journey
[45:07] our journey is not a microwave journey
[45:11] it's a crock pot it's a long journey
[45:14] we've been in this thing a long time and
[45:17] you know what God's let it go this long
[45:20] like black says thank you God just ran
[45:24] I'll assist thank you god she's Becca
[45:25] shaking her head now we just baptize
[45:27] these young people we baptize about six
[45:30] or seven or eight people since the first
[45:32] of the year well we've come to a place
[45:34] now to where we got the eleventh hour
[45:37] people on the field I believe I believe
[45:38] we have all the players here I believe
[45:41] God's over there raising 144,000 right
[45:44] now waiting on us to get out of the way
[45:48] so what are we doing here we're waiting
[45:51] on the last we're waiting on my kids and
[45:54] your kids hey man you got a blank you
[45:58] got a claim that and then claim it so
[46:03] here we are now it came to pass in the
[46:05] days of a source this is the king now
[46:07] watch this is the king who reigned from
[46:08] India to Ethiopia over a hundred and
[46:11] twenty seven provinces like I said he
[46:14] wasn't just the king of a little Georgia
[46:16] with two hundred 200 residents he he
[46:19] impacted millions of people all right by
[46:22] the decisions that he made then on those
[46:24] days when the king of storr sat in the
[46:25] throne of the kingdom which was in
[46:27] Shushan the palace in other words he had
[46:29] a place in the third year of his reign
[46:30] he made a feast here we go with the
[46:33] threes in the sevens in his third year
[46:35] why wasn't it two or four or nine it's
[46:40] three in the third year of his reign he
[46:43] made a feast
[46:44] what is the feast it's a gathering unto
[46:46] all princes and his servants the power
[46:48] of Persia Medea and the nobles in other
[46:50] words this guy had a lot of power when
[46:53] he showed the riches of his glorious
[46:55] Kingdom verse for the honor of his
[46:58] excellent majesty many days even 180
[47:02] days what word mercy s alone time and
[47:04] when these days were expired the King
[47:07] made a feast unto all the people you
[47:10] need to I've lost
[47:12] you need to keep scrolling okay and when
[47:23] these days were expired the key made a
[47:25] feast unto all the people that were
[47:26] present in Shushan the palace both under
[47:28] great and small as we said before it
[47:31] didn't matter great and small in the
[47:33] feast was seven days we've had a
[47:36] seven-day feast the king called the
[47:40] feast on the day of Pentecost and he was
[47:44] gone for seven church ages and what's
[47:48] happening during this time we're at the
[47:50] very end of it
[47:51] amen in the court of the garden of the
[47:54] king's palace with white and green blues
[47:56] look at all the different colors of the
[47:58] different things purple silver verse
[48:01] seven and gave them drinks and vessels
[48:04] of gold the vessels being diverse one
[48:07] from another the vessels being diverse
[48:13] but made of gold you and I were gold
[48:17] tried in the fire but we're diverse
[48:19] what's telling brother Tom we've got
[48:21] many nations that are that are
[48:23] represented here countries they're
[48:26] represented in this congregation well
[48:28] God's calling all of us and he's what
[48:30] has he given us he's giving us the royal
[48:32] wine wine being a type of the Holy Ghost
[48:34] all right
[48:35] in abundance he didn't just pour it one
[48:40] time right in abundance according to the
[48:45] state of the King so here you got a king
[48:49] and this King has made a feast for seven
[48:51] days and and he's got this thing going
[48:53] on and you know what he wants to do he's
[48:56] got a queen over there he's got a queen
[49:00] over there and he wants to show her off
[49:08] he wants to show her off okay but what
[49:15] did that Queen do that queen is Baxter
[49:19] he hadn't got to the one that he really
[49:22] didn't know he was looking for see God's
[49:26] not that
[49:26] he knows but this King didn't know so
[49:29] look at verse nine
[49:30] also vast time which means beautiful hey
[49:33] look
[49:33] John admired that Church in the Book of
[49:36] Revelations he admired that beautiful
[49:40] church that was full of what dead man's
[49:45] bones
[49:46] harlots and all these different things
[49:49] so but Vashti the Queen made her a feast
[49:56] in a royal house which belong to the
[49:59] king so there's Bastile setting up
[50:04] another meeting here's God he's got his
[50:08] purpose he's got his seven church ages
[50:10] he's got his seven angels he's got his
[50:12] seven stars in his hand he's got his
[50:15] seven spirits that come to anoint that
[50:19] church age and then all of a sudden his
[50:24] bride that he thought was very loyal she
[50:29] said I don't want to have anything to do
[50:31] with that the property God tells us that
[50:35] she said King I'm not gonna do what you
[50:43] say anymore ain't that what the
[50:46] denomination world are doing now God
[50:49] never taught him a Trinity God never
[50:50] taught him they could cut their hair God
[50:51] never taught them they could do whatever
[50:53] they wanted to do amen
[50:54] so where did that come from that didn't
[50:56] come from the king but vast I get this
[51:01] idea that she's going to be her own
[51:03] she's gonna do her own thing that
[51:05] doesn't sound like the people today I'll
[51:07] do my own thing remember in the Bible it
[51:08] tells us that in the end time that seven
[51:11] women will take hold of one man and say
[51:13] don't tell us what to do but we want
[51:15] your name we'll see they want the name
[51:17] Jesus Christ but they don't know the
[51:18] name Jesus like Christ like brother Dale
[51:20] was talking about an intimate
[51:22] relationship with God in fact at one
[51:25] time had had an intimate relationship
[51:27] with the king but she decided that she
[51:31] wasn't going to have anything else to do
[51:33] she's going to have her own and on the
[51:37] seventh day when the heart of the king
[51:39] was married with
[51:40] wine he commanded as we were talking
[51:43] last Sunday it's kind of it's not it's
[51:45] not funny but the word is so perfect
[51:48] look may ma'am mr. harbona Victor a
[51:51] bagasse that's our and what's the last
[51:54] one
[51:55] carcass where the carcass is there will
[51:59] the eagle's be gathered carcass number
[52:02] seven he wasn't five or four he was
[52:04] seven the seven Chamberlain's that
[52:07] served in the presence of a source the
[52:10] king now what were they they were his
[52:13] advisors preachers everybody got that to
[52:21] bring vast I'm the queen in other words
[52:24] go out and preach the gospel tell the
[52:26] people about this queen but because he's
[52:35] going to say go bring vast I'm the queen
[52:37] before the king with the crown royal to
[52:40] show the people and the princes her
[52:42] beauty for she was fair to look on but
[52:45] the Queen vast I refused now listen if
[52:49] you refuse a king normally that's death
[52:52] you don't refuse to come into a king of
[52:55] the King calls for you there's two
[52:57] things you don't do you don't go see a
[52:58] king unless he calls you and you don't
[53:01] not go if he calls you so what she sees
[53:05] now coz water denouement denominational
[53:08] world now they're dead they're dead to
[53:10] God they're dead to their King amen I'm
[53:14] just telling you what the Prophet told
[53:16] us he hated that God hates that
[53:20] denomination you don't hate the people
[53:21] but he hates that idea what the idea
[53:23] that they can do what they want to do
[53:25] that they've got a vast Isle that's
[53:27] going to refuse to come to the Kings
[53:29] commandment by his what his preachers
[53:33] therefore was the king very wroth and
[53:35] his anger burned in him verse 13 then
[53:39] the king said two wise men which knew
[53:40] the times for so was it this King had it
[53:45] together he had seven Chamberlain and he
[53:49] had seven advisors now who watch who
[53:52] these advisors
[53:53] our then the king said to the wise men
[53:58] which knew the times for so was the
[53:59] Kings manner toward all that new law and
[54:01] judgment and the next under him was
[54:03] carshena
[54:04] sets are now look here we go one two
[54:07] anetha three torches for marriage five
[54:10] marason death and ma'am you can ma'am
[54:14] you can these messengers ma'am you can
[54:17] means dignified but watch what the whole
[54:20] story is there's six other opportunities
[54:23] for somebody to come up with an idea
[54:27] because the King's got a dilemma
[54:30] here's his beautiful Queen that he's
[54:33] trying to show off to the world and
[54:35] she's saying I don't want to have
[54:37] anything to do with the game so he's
[54:40] calling these wise men and saying hey
[54:42] what can I do and the one that speaks up
[54:47] is number seven not the first one or the
[54:51] third one or the tenth one there's no
[54:53] tension but seven watch the seven prince
[54:56] of the Persian of Medea which saw the
[54:58] Kings face at which set the first in the
[55:00] kingdom what shall we do unto Queen
[55:03] Vashti according to the law because she
[55:06] has not performed the commandment of the
[55:07] king of sorts by the Chamberlain and
[55:09] then here number seven
[55:11] memucan answered before the king and the
[55:13] prince and the princess back style the
[55:16] Queen hath not done wrong to the King
[55:18] only but to all the provinces you know
[55:23] why because that mother has got
[55:27] daughters a man that mother got
[55:30] daughters and them daughters are gonna
[55:32] listen to Vashta and if they don't do
[55:36] something the whole kingdom is gonna say
[55:38] we don't need a man we don't need
[55:40] headship that's what that's what the
[55:43] denominational world are telling they
[55:45] don't need headship and ma'am you can't
[55:50] answer before the king and the princess
[55:51] banks not the Queen have not done wrong
[55:53] to the King only but also to all the
[55:55] provinces to all the people that are in
[55:57] all the provinces of the king of sorts
[56:00] for this deed of the Queen shall come
[56:03] abroad into all women what's a women top
[56:05] of churches so
[56:07] that they shall despise their what their
[56:11] headship they've despised the headship
[56:15] of the word when he shall be reported
[56:19] the King of sewers commanded by styler
[56:21] queen to be brought in before him but
[56:23] she came not so he's got a dilemma so
[56:26] ma'am you can comes up with this idea
[56:28] because watch likewise show the ladies
[56:30] of Persia Medea say this damn to all the
[56:32] Kings princes which has heard of the
[56:34] deed of the Queen thus shall there
[56:36] arrives too much contempt and wrath the
[56:40] whole country is going to be affected if
[56:42] it pleases the king let there go a royal
[56:45] commandment from him and let it be
[56:47] written among the laws of the Persians
[56:49] and the Medes that it be not altered
[56:54] eleven hundred sermons sent to all the
[56:57] provinces that bastok came no more come
[57:02] no more listen when that seventh angel
[57:05] messenger hit the earth he condemned
[57:10] that denomination system and says she's
[57:14] dead and never will come back again
[57:16] that's the same thing this guy's telling
[57:18] them ma'am you can't say it look this is
[57:20] what we need to do that best I come no
[57:24] more before King the source and let the
[57:26] King give her royal estate unto another
[57:28] that is better than she now listen you
[57:32] and I are not better than the world but
[57:34] if you're the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:35] you're the best there is none none
[57:38] compared to you they'd be okay
[57:42] that Bank stock come no more in other
[57:45] words cut her off and let the King dur
[57:47] of her royal estate unto another that is
[57:49] better than she and when the Kings
[57:51] decree which he shall make shall be
[57:53] published throughout all his empire
[57:58] eleven hundred sermons published and
[58:01] giving all over the world all the wives
[58:04] shall give to their husbands honor both
[58:06] to the great and small what did the
[58:08] property God come to do he came just
[58:10] like the Elijah come to restore the
[58:12] method of worship
[58:14] remember what Elijah did they jumped up
[58:17] and down on the altar and they spread it
[58:18] out everywhere and here comes Elijah
[58:20] sitting him
[58:21] stones back together same way with the
[58:23] prophet of God he'd come to set
[58:24] everything back in order plus plus if I
[58:32] got that because remember the message of
[58:33] Malachi forced to do two things restore
[58:36] the hearts of the children to the
[58:37] father's and bring those unknown
[58:39] mysteries that nobody ever looked that
[58:41] nobody ever looked upon what to change
[58:43] our body that's to get us at the top at
[58:47] the headstone because what's gonna
[58:49] happen is in this story if we ever get
[58:52] finished with it in this story you've
[58:54] got this girl she's not even on the
[58:56] scene yet extras not even here yet sure
[58:59] she's there she's alive she's walking
[59:02] around somewhere out in the world but
[59:05] this Queen has been replaced by Esther
[59:11] as we continue into the story and then
[59:14] when we get to the end of the story you
[59:16] don't even see the King anymore Esther's
[59:20] doing all the ruin with Mordecai so what
[59:24] a wonderful story I mean it ought to
[59:25] throw your heart that this was done for
[59:30] me and you so that we can look at that
[59:34] and say God you worked through that
[59:37] whole life for that whole scene of
[59:39] Esther because remember extra was not an
[59:42] original book that they were going to
[59:43] put in the Bible the scholars wanted it
[59:47] put in because it typed so much of
[59:49] Christ in the Jews and not letting them
[59:52] die on all these different things so it
[59:54] was given to me though so that I can
[59:57] look at it because look the saying
[59:59] please the king and the princes and the
[1:00:02] King did according to the word of memik
[1:00:04] and what a powerful word this man had
[1:00:06] for he sent messages into all the kings
[1:00:09] problems into ever promised according to
[1:00:12] the writing thereof and look and every
[1:00:14] person after their own language it was
[1:00:15] recorded in all different languages this
[1:00:18] must be a pretty important message that
[1:00:22] every man should bear rule in his own
[1:00:24] house why did brother Branham restore he
[1:00:26] restored headship votes headship is what
[1:00:29] was lost down through the church ages he
[1:00:32] restored the headship back
[1:00:33] the church and every man should rule in
[1:00:38] his own house and that it should be
[1:00:41] published according to the language in
[1:00:44] other words none is going to be left out
[1:00:47] everybody is going to get this spreading
[1:00:50] of this message this seventh messenger
[1:00:53] that spoke to the king thank God we had
[1:00:58] a messenger thank God we had somebody
[1:01:01] we're gonna see in a minute we're gonna
[1:01:04] see Mordechai now come on the scene
[1:01:06] extra chapter two and after these things
[1:01:09] when the wrath of King of sorts was a
[1:01:10] piece he remembered last time what she
[1:01:13] had done and what was decreed against
[1:01:15] her then said the Kings servants that
[1:01:17] minister unto Him let there be fair
[1:01:19] young virgins stocked for the King
[1:01:21] sought for the King and let the King
[1:01:24] appoint officers and all the province of
[1:01:26] his kingdom he's looking for a bride so
[1:01:31] he's going to appoint preachers not a
[1:01:33] onefold not a press play but a fivefold
[1:01:40] ministry that God is going to work
[1:01:43] through flesh again to find his bride I
[1:01:48] may hurt your feelings but unit needs to
[1:01:50] be I guess if you believe that then said
[1:01:53] the King service that ministered unto
[1:01:55] Him let there be fair virgins and let
[1:01:58] the King appoint officers and all the
[1:02:00] provinces of his kingdom that they may
[1:02:02] gather together all the fair young
[1:02:04] virgins under Shushan the palace to the
[1:02:07] house of the women into the custody of
[1:02:09] Hagee the Kings Chamberlain now here's a
[1:02:14] guy that's a eunuch it's a man that
[1:02:20] keeps up with the women but he's been
[1:02:22] fixed where he can't you understand what
[1:02:24] I mean I don't have to go any further
[1:02:25] than that alright but you know what that
[1:02:27] word means if you dig deeper to your
[1:02:29] overlying meaning is a different meaning
[1:02:31] but if you look it up a little bit
[1:02:33] deeper that word or that name means the
[1:02:37] word so how better are we going to find
[1:02:41] a bride then through the word
[1:02:46] keeper of the why what are women
[1:02:49] church's brides and let their things for
[1:02:53] purification be giving them verse four
[1:02:56] and let the maiden which please it the
[1:03:00] King now look this is God just you got
[1:03:04] to go with me here for a minute you see
[1:03:06] what God is doing he's giving this
[1:03:08] responsibility this King is given that
[1:03:10] responsibility over to his people the
[1:03:14] seven Chamberlain's and the different
[1:03:16] ones he's giving you said well what
[1:03:18] about listen folks brother Branham said
[1:03:21] he said God never does tire of you
[1:03:25] telling him what his word says he knows
[1:03:29] what it says he knows what you gonna do
[1:03:31] but he wants you to speak it that's
[1:03:36] where we all get involved sisters
[1:03:39] brothers and all of us and let the mate
[1:03:42] in which please it the King be queen
[1:03:45] instead of last time and the thing
[1:03:47] please the King and he did so now in
[1:03:51] Shushan the palace there was a certain
[1:03:52] Jew now watch here we come
[1:03:54] this guy named Mordecai now those you've
[1:03:57] been around the message long enough you
[1:03:58] ought to know who the Mordecai means a
[1:04:00] little man his literal meaning of his
[1:04:03] name is and I can't remember what number
[1:04:05] it is in the in the Greek lexicon but
[1:04:09] his name was Mordecai which means little
[1:04:13] man we had a little man coming in town
[1:04:16] and this little man is going to guide
[1:04:19] this bride to the king now what did
[1:04:23] brother Brown do he guided the bride to
[1:04:27] the king now and she's shown the palace
[1:04:29] of a certain Jews name was Mordecai the
[1:04:31] son of jar the son of Shem I the son of
[1:04:33] Kish a Benjamite but now less this is
[1:04:39] this is not funny but you know what you
[1:04:41] know where you know where Kish came from
[1:04:44] don't you yeah who was the who was kiss
[1:04:48] his son Saul you say how can you type
[1:04:53] that lineage anybody ever know what
[1:04:56] brother Brown's family was like
[1:04:59] drunks alcoholics mother Brown said died
[1:05:03] with the boots on not much to be you
[1:05:07] understand what I'm saying
[1:05:08] so this guy that we're typing with
[1:05:10] Mordechai he couldn't have this great
[1:05:12] lineage he had to be the end of the type
[1:05:14] of brother branham he had to be a son of
[1:05:17] Kish a Benjamin Knight a Benjamite who
[1:05:20] had carried away now remember more to
[1:05:22] come if you'll remember the back of the
[1:05:24] story that we've told a long time ago
[1:05:26] some of the Jews in a dispersal state in
[1:05:29] Jerusalem a lot of them came out and
[1:05:32] went to this place because that was
[1:05:35] where all the hey that you still like
[1:05:37] the money that's where the money was was
[1:05:40] under these Medes and Persians they were
[1:05:42] carried away from Jerusalem with the
[1:05:43] captivity which had been carried away
[1:05:45] with Jeconiah king of Judah whom
[1:05:48] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had
[1:05:49] carried away and he brought up this girl
[1:05:52] now remember she had a name called
[1:05:55] Hadassah
[1:05:58] Hadassah was her Jewish name but she got
[1:06:04] a name change amen
[1:06:10] she got a name change now remember what
[1:06:18] Esther means we know extra means star
[1:06:20] but you know what Hadassah means but
[1:06:23] that's that means Myrtle Myrtle tree
[1:06:28] Myrtle so if you look in the bittakers
[1:06:30] 23:33 myrtle is used under the Feast of
[1:06:35] Tabernacles what do we what are we
[1:06:39] feasting under now brother Dale told you
[1:06:41] this morning under the feast of
[1:06:43] tabernacle all right so then you say
[1:06:46] well what are you saying I'm saying this
[1:06:47] esther is not just an extra of all the
[1:06:49] bride this esther is an end time bride
[1:06:52] this extra somebody that me and you can
[1:06:56] relate to and he brought up Hadassah
[1:07:00] that is Esther his uncle's daughter for
[1:07:02] she had neither what father and her
[1:07:06] mother she had no ties supposedly no
[1:07:08] ties to the world when you become asked
[1:07:11] her do you have any
[1:07:12] eyes of the world no I know it's hard
[1:07:15] after every time I say after she turned
[1:07:17] to looked at me because this is an ester
[1:07:19] here we've got an extra Martinez and
[1:07:21] Esther wherever she is but every time I
[1:07:25] say something Esther looked over at me
[1:07:27] so anyway asked her up here okay after
[1:07:32] his uncle dart she need to father a
[1:07:33] mother the maid was fair and beautiful
[1:07:35] who Mordecai when her father and mother
[1:07:38] were dead took for his own daughter in
[1:07:40] other words he took her in because she
[1:07:43] had a mother and a father and they died
[1:07:45] so she took him he took her in and he
[1:07:52] what he raised her as her own daughter
[1:07:55] as his own daughter
[1:07:57] listen focus properly in the end time
[1:07:59] people can say whatever they want to
[1:08:01] about him I really don't care but he was
[1:08:06] sent on this earth to get me to Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ he was sent to raise me right he
[1:08:14] was sent to show me what to do and
[1:08:16] that's what that Mordecai did because
[1:08:19] that girl Esther had no direction
[1:08:22] she had no father no mother no sisters
[1:08:24] no brothers so Mordecai comes on the
[1:08:27] scene and says hey I'll take you in I'll
[1:08:31] help you out I'll get you to the king
[1:08:35] that's our goal
[1:08:37] because listen if we look in the rest of
[1:08:40] the story there's thousands of virgins
[1:08:43] literally thousands of virgins that the
[1:08:47] king could have paid thousands but he
[1:08:54] picked her
[1:08:55] why because I'll show it to you just a
[1:08:57] second so it came to pass when the King
[1:09:00] command went and his decree was heard
[1:09:03] and when many maidens were gathered
[1:09:05] together under Shushan the palace to the
[1:09:06] custody of Haggai because he raises us i
[1:09:11] see william branham didn't raise this
[1:09:12] folks you know that the words what
[1:09:15] raised us but he spoke the word through
[1:09:18] God spoke to brother Branham to give us
[1:09:20] a word to live by and man that Esther
[1:09:24] was brought also into the Kings house to
[1:09:25] the custody
[1:09:26] hey guy keeper of the women and the
[1:09:28] maiden pleased him and shipped ain't
[1:09:30] look she didn't come in and say blessed
[1:09:32] God I'm the only one I'm the only one in
[1:09:36] this place you gotta look at me no she
[1:09:38] comes in she obtains kindness of him of
[1:09:41] who hey guys she don't even know what
[1:09:43] you don't even know King yet and he
[1:09:46] speedily gave her her things for
[1:09:49] purification
[1:09:50] what's purifying you and I today the
[1:09:54] Word of God is what purifying us to this
[1:09:57] day which such things has belong to her
[1:10:01] and give her seven maidens which were
[1:10:04] meat to be given her out of the king's
[1:10:05] house and he preferred her and her
[1:10:08] maidens into the best place of the house
[1:10:12] of the women but now look extra had a
[1:10:16] secret after had a secret after was a
[1:10:23] Jew
[1:10:25] extra had a secret but Esther had not
[1:10:30] showed her people nor her kindred for
[1:10:32] Mordecai charged her that she should not
[1:10:36] show it so Mordecai saying look your Jew
[1:10:39] I know you're different but just hang on
[1:10:43] a little while cuz you're gonna need
[1:10:44] that difference in just a little while
[1:10:46] for something coming up and Mordecai
[1:10:50] look Mordechai walked every day before
[1:10:54] the court of the woman's house to know
[1:10:56] how Esther did he didn't come up one day
[1:10:58] and say alright Esther there's the king
[1:11:01] I'll see you later
[1:11:04] no he brought us sermon after sermon and
[1:11:07] years and years of labor to bring me in
[1:11:11] you and thank God they put it in booking
[1:11:13] tape for him so that we still got it
[1:11:15] and this Mordecai's willis today in word
[1:11:19] form telling us what to do and how to
[1:11:21] get to the king to know how yesterday
[1:11:24] and what became of her
[1:11:25] now when every maids turn was come in to
[1:11:27] go to a king to the king a source after
[1:11:30] that she had been 12 months look this is
[1:11:33] not like I said it's not a crock-pot
[1:11:34] journey I mean this is not a microwave
[1:11:36] journey this is a crock pot journey
[1:11:38] twelve months
[1:11:39] according to the manner of the women for
[1:11:42] so were the days of their purification
[1:11:43] and if you'll study this we don't have
[1:11:46] time to go through it I studied it not
[1:11:48] too long ago well several years ago
[1:11:49] because six months they would wash you
[1:11:54] six months in oil of myrrh and six
[1:11:58] months with sweet odours you'd think by
[1:12:00] then they'd smell good after a year of
[1:12:03] that but there's a there's an
[1:12:04] implication of that but we're not going
[1:12:05] to save time then the scam ever maiden
[1:12:08] into the king whatsoever she desired was
[1:12:11] given to her now here's the key with her
[1:12:17] out of the house of the women until the
[1:12:18] king's house in other words hey guy
[1:12:20] comes and says what do you need I want
[1:12:24] this beautiful dress with wherever
[1:12:27] where's my wife at with with glitter on
[1:12:30] it my wife hates glitter glitter and all
[1:12:33] this stuff real shiny so that so that
[1:12:36] it'll catch the attention of the King
[1:12:38] because remember it's not just a few
[1:12:40] women as hundreds it's thousands of
[1:12:42] women trying to get the attention of the
[1:12:44] king then thus came every maiden unto
[1:12:48] the king whatsoever she desired was
[1:12:50] given to her to go out with her out of
[1:12:53] the house of the women into the king's
[1:12:54] house in the evening she went and on the
[1:12:58] morrow she returned into the second
[1:13:01] house of the women to the custody of
[1:13:02] chefs cause the Kings Chamberlain which
[1:13:04] kept the concubines now look they were
[1:13:06] all concubines at one time all right she
[1:13:09] came in into the King no more except the
[1:13:15] King delighted in her and had to call
[1:13:17] her by name got to the Prophet he says
[1:13:25] now I call you bride now you have a name
[1:13:29] now when the turn of Astra now look look
[1:13:33] at me just a minute a king has looked at
[1:13:36] a thousand women must have a pretty good
[1:13:41] memory to remember all of them but when
[1:13:45] he meets one
[1:13:48] all the others go away he probably
[1:13:52] remembered this one had a had a dress on
[1:13:55] that had glitter and he this one had
[1:13:57] feathers in her hair and this one had
[1:14:00] makeup on their face and this one that
[1:14:02] had earrings brother branham tells us
[1:14:04] about that but when he come Esther's
[1:14:06] turn all she took was who she was
[1:14:11] she took her character into that room
[1:14:14] with the key now when the turn of Esther
[1:14:17] the daughter of Abigail the uncle of
[1:14:18] Mordecai who had taken her for his own
[1:14:20] daughter was come to go into the king
[1:14:22] she required nothing but what hey guy
[1:14:25] the Kings Chamberlain in other words the
[1:14:27] word she closed herself with the word an
[1:14:31] Esther up came favoring the side of all
[1:14:34] of them that looked owner that got to
[1:14:37] the king yet so Astra was taken into
[1:14:42] King asaurus unto King a source into his
[1:14:44] house royal in the tenth month which is
[1:14:48] a month of T best in the seventh year
[1:14:51] not for not not not to seventh the
[1:14:58] seventh year of his reign he finally
[1:15:00] meets the bride that he's been looking
[1:15:03] for she don't have one no makeup she
[1:15:07] don't have on a pantsuit never had do
[1:15:11] you don't have brother I'm call him here
[1:15:13] Bob's don't have here bob was hanging
[1:15:15] over here and look what happened he
[1:15:19] instantly falls in love with her I'm
[1:15:23] gonna read you a quote right here I
[1:15:24] picked it they don't have it back there
[1:15:26] brother Brian said in the marriage of
[1:15:28] the lamb real quick Esther it was to
[1:15:29] become a bride but she didn't want none
[1:15:32] of the adorning of the world she wanted
[1:15:34] to go in to the king just like she was
[1:15:39] she adorned themselves like the
[1:15:41] Pentecostal women ought to with a meek
[1:15:43] humble spirit and when all these fancy
[1:15:46] first ladies came by with all their
[1:15:48] newfangled things and the King looked at
[1:15:50] them and put them in the chamber with
[1:15:52] the concubines but when this Esther came
[1:15:56] into his side he got a glimpse of that
[1:15:59] sweet humble meek spirit he
[1:16:02] said that's her go get the crown go get
[1:16:06] the crown and put it on her head that's
[1:16:11] how quick when God sees the Holy Ghost
[1:16:14] filled woman when God sees his true
[1:16:17] bride he don't mess around he said she's
[1:16:21] mine she's mine thank you for pulling it
[1:16:24] up that's okay
[1:16:25] so last row was taken in the king source
[1:16:28] into his house the tenth month in the
[1:16:30] seventh year of his reign and the King
[1:16:32] loved Esther above all the women and she
[1:16:34] obtained Grace and favor in his sight
[1:16:37] more than all the virgins so that he set
[1:16:40] the royal crown upon her head and made
[1:16:42] her Queen instead of last time then the
[1:16:46] King made a great feast unto all his
[1:16:48] princes and his servants and it became
[1:16:50] not the Kings feast
[1:16:53] it became Esther's feast it became his
[1:16:57] Brides feast he was going to put his
[1:17:00] bride on display because he had found
[1:17:03] the right one he had found the right
[1:17:06] person
[1:17:07] even Esther's feast and he made a
[1:17:09] release and that word release in the
[1:17:12] original is rest hey listen when you
[1:17:16] find your bride you're not looking no
[1:17:20] more when you find your bride you're not
[1:17:24] looking the more you come to a rest and
[1:17:29] he made a rest to the provinces and gave
[1:17:32] gifts according to the state of the king
[1:17:36] now watch real quick I got all this
[1:17:40] written down in my Bible excuse me now
[1:17:48] look and when the Virgin's were gathered
[1:17:51] together the second time then Mordecai
[1:17:52] said in the Kings gate now if you look
[1:17:56] back in your history the Kings gate was
[1:18:00] right at the king's palace now you
[1:18:03] couldn't go in unless the King called
[1:18:05] you but you were so close you could hear
[1:18:08] what was going on inside the palace that
[1:18:11] reminds you of something this prophet in
[1:18:14] the end time he wasn't out there sitting
[1:18:15] in the
[1:18:16] our room he wasn't out there sitting
[1:18:18] somewhere else he was sitting right at
[1:18:19] the Kings gate he had a connection to
[1:18:24] God like no one else but now he didn't
[1:18:28] use it for his own glory
[1:18:32] Mordecai everything he heard he told her
[1:18:36] everything he turned he had he heard he
[1:18:41] told Esther same way her brother branham
[1:18:44] thank God he couldn't keep a secret
[1:18:47] amen now look and when the virgins were
[1:18:51] gathered together the second time
[1:18:55] Mordecai sat in the Kings gate now look
[1:18:57] here's Esther Esther had not yet showed
[1:18:59] her kindred nor her people so they
[1:19:02] didn't know she was a Jew as Mordecai
[1:19:04] had charged her for Esther did the
[1:19:06] commandment of Mordecai walk this like
[1:19:09] us when she was brought up with him she
[1:19:11] did what her prophet told her to do hey
[1:19:15] man she was loyal she was sweet she was
[1:19:17] almost she didn't say bless God I you
[1:19:20] need to you need to attend to me I ain't
[1:19:22] got no mama or daddy no she went that
[1:19:23] way she listened to Mordecai just like
[1:19:26] she listened to her own mom and daddy do
[1:19:30] we do we do we listen all we want to
[1:19:39] listen to what we want to listen to in
[1:19:42] those days while Mordecai said in the
[1:19:44] Kings gate to the Kings Chamberlain's
[1:19:46] now look this Mordecai guy he's pretty
[1:19:49] sharp and he gets revelation because he
[1:19:55] can hear where me and you can't hear
[1:19:57] that's what the Prophet does right he
[1:20:00] hears from God and then he gives it to
[1:20:02] us right Amen so he hears this plan of
[1:20:08] these two guys that want to kill the
[1:20:10] king and the thing was known to Mordecai
[1:20:14] and Mordecai did what Mordecai got a
[1:20:18] revelation from God that something was
[1:20:20] going to happen and he tells Esther
[1:20:23] because Esther
[1:20:27] can go see the king of the king an
[1:20:30] Esther certified the king thereof in
[1:20:33] Mordecai's name and when inquisition was
[1:20:36] made in other words this is a natural
[1:20:38] story it was found out that for they
[1:20:39] were both hanging on a tree and it was
[1:20:40] written in the book of The Chronicles
[1:20:41] before the king so here this Mordecai
[1:20:44] guy he's he's right there at the Kings
[1:20:46] gate he gets to hear what revelation
[1:20:50] from God revelations from the King hello
[1:20:53] laughter three now this guy's coming
[1:20:56] into being here his name is Haman now
[1:21:01] there's a little bit of history behind
[1:21:03] Haman because everybody's got a lineage
[1:21:06] so Haman is the evil guy he's tough he's
[1:21:09] the type of the devil in this whole
[1:21:11] story there buddy got that and after
[1:21:17] these things did king of sewers promote
[1:21:19] Haman now you wondering where this is
[1:21:23] going but look if you'll go to I had it
[1:21:29] written down somewhere if you'll go to I
[1:21:32] think it's Ezekiel Ezekiel God's talking
[1:21:37] to the devil and he says I made you
[1:21:39] perfect I put you above all the anointed
[1:21:43] cherub I put you above everybody and
[1:21:46] that's what this King just did he
[1:21:49] promoted Haman now Haman the son of hat
[1:21:52] Hamid otha the a guy now if you'll
[1:21:55] remember back in your Bible
[1:21:57] the a gots or a guys in first time
[1:22:01] you'll 15 it was one of those Kings that
[1:22:04] Saul didn't kill maybe I got that but
[1:22:08] that lineage of Haman comes from Amalek
[1:22:14] the grandson of Esau and what did God
[1:22:17] tell Moses and all of joshua to do he
[1:22:22] said kill every malachite because
[1:22:25] remember when Amalek when they want
[1:22:26] israel one to go through the country in
[1:22:29] their exile or went in their Exodus the
[1:22:32] Amalekites wouldn't let them go through
[1:22:34] their land so God said kill them all get
[1:22:36] rid of not no more today will I have
[1:22:39] anything to do with it
[1:22:40] well that's where this guy Heyman came
[1:22:42] from this work the devil come from
[1:22:45] Devils gotta Lenny he was created
[1:22:50] perfect but he decided he made a
[1:22:53] decision to but it didn't he tried to
[1:22:56] justify itself he didn't get justified
[1:22:59] and advanced him and sent his seat above
[1:23:02] all the princes that were with him and
[1:23:05] all the king's servants that were in the
[1:23:07] Kings gate bowed and reverence Haman but
[1:23:11] now watch this for the King had so
[1:23:13] commanded concerning him but Mordecai
[1:23:15] bowed not you know why
[1:23:19] Mordecai knew his lineage Mordecai knew
[1:23:24] his natural lineage he knew where Haman
[1:23:27] came from he came from that Amalekite
[1:23:30] that Mordecai seek God told me never to
[1:23:33] bow to them people so he didn't listen
[1:23:36] the prophet of God many times the devil
[1:23:39] would come remember the devil came and
[1:23:41] said all your religion what's going on
[1:23:43] you know what God's taking you kid and
[1:23:46] taking your wife and what's going on
[1:23:49] here prophet he never bowed to the devil
[1:23:53] hey and Mordecai never either nor did
[1:23:57] him reverence then the king's servants
[1:23:59] which were in the Kings gate sent in the
[1:24:01] Mordecai why transgresseth now the Kings
[1:24:03] commandment he never answered him you'd
[1:24:06] have to he knew in his heart he wasn't
[1:24:09] going to bow to that Amalek lineage now
[1:24:13] it came to pass when they spate daily
[1:24:15] into him and he hearkened not unto them
[1:24:16] that they told Haman to see where the
[1:24:18] more to come matter Mordecai was no
[1:24:19] matter would stand for he had told them
[1:24:21] that he was a Jew and when Haman saw
[1:24:23] that Mordecai about not nor did him
[1:24:25] reverence then was Haman full of wrath
[1:24:28] and he thought scorn to lay hands on
[1:24:31] Mordecai alone for they'd showed him the
[1:24:32] people of Mordecai which is what the
[1:24:35] Jews listen the devil hates the Jews the
[1:24:40] devil has persecuted the Jews forever
[1:24:45] and when Mordecai they had showed unto
[1:24:50] him the people of Mordecai where for
[1:24:52] Haman saw
[1:24:54] destroy all the Jews that were
[1:24:56] throughout the whole kingdom of the
[1:24:57] source
[1:24:57] even the people Mordecai I've always
[1:24:59] said before you look at that spirit that
[1:25:01] was on Haman that spirit that was on
[1:25:03] Haman when Haman died that spirit went
[1:25:06] right over to the next to 8070 in Titus
[1:25:10] then then when Titus died that went
[1:25:12] right over to where Hitler and Mussolini
[1:25:14] and all the different ones because that
[1:25:17] spirit never dies because Haman is now
[1:25:20] he hates the Jews because of Mordecai he
[1:25:23] hates the Jews and he wants to get rid
[1:25:25] of all of them everybody got that
[1:25:29] now look we'll do this we'll get to this
[1:25:35] certain spot right here and then we'll
[1:25:36] stop the looking look what's going on
[1:25:42] here
[1:25:42] you got Haman which type of the devil in
[1:25:45] the first month that's a month Nissen of
[1:25:48] the 12th year of king of source that
[1:25:49] casper that is the law before Haman from
[1:25:52] day to day and from month to month to
[1:25:54] the 12th month that is the month adar
[1:25:55] and Haman said unto the king of stories
[1:25:57] there is a certain people there's a
[1:26:02] certain people that I hate because God's
[1:26:11] going to allow what's God always allowed
[1:26:14] the devil to do drive his people back to
[1:26:19] their homeland because Israel at this
[1:26:21] point in time Israel is not in their
[1:26:23] homeland not all of them so he's going
[1:26:27] to use the poor old devil to get
[1:26:28] everybody back in the homeland just like
[1:26:30] right now look at them over there now
[1:26:32] same thing and Haman said in the king of
[1:26:34] sorts there's a certain people scattered
[1:26:36] abroad and dispersed among the people
[1:26:38] than all the provinces ain't that what
[1:26:40] happened to the Jews after 80 70 was
[1:26:43] what dispersed all over the world but
[1:26:46] remember God's not gonna deal with them
[1:26:48] until they get back in the homeland all
[1:26:50] right to watch this and their laws are
[1:26:52] diverse they go by that Old Testament
[1:26:56] huh they go by that Old Testament we
[1:27:00] don't go by that no more Haman says all
[1:27:03] right look but there's excuse me and
[1:27:06] their laws are diverse for
[1:27:07] all people neither keep day the Kings
[1:27:10] law oh my goodness
[1:27:12] therefore it is not for the king's
[1:27:14] profit to suffer them or let them live
[1:27:17] if it please the King let it be written
[1:27:20] that they may be destroyed and I will
[1:27:24] pay ten thousand talents of silver
[1:27:25] devils always gotten the money in his
[1:27:28] hand to the hands of those that have the
[1:27:30] charge of the business to bring it into
[1:27:32] the Kings Treasuries and the King took
[1:27:34] his ring from his hand and he gave it to
[1:27:36] Haman now wait a minute we got a problem
[1:27:41] here God is taking his ring off and he's
[1:27:44] giving power to Haman where does that
[1:27:49] come from revelations chapter 6 power
[1:27:54] was given power was given Satan has no
[1:27:58] power he had had power given power was
[1:28:01] given unto the devil to do these things
[1:28:03] power was given unto Haman to do these
[1:28:06] things he was an enemy of the Jews and
[1:28:09] the king sent unto Him and the silver is
[1:28:10] given to thee of the people also to do
[1:28:13] with them at Saint what seemeth good to
[1:28:15] thee then were the Kings scribes called
[1:28:18] on the 13th day of the first month and
[1:28:20] there was written according to all that
[1:28:22] Haman had commanded unto the Kings
[1:28:24] lieutenants and to the governor's that
[1:28:26] were over every province to the rulers
[1:28:28] of every people of every province in
[1:28:29] other words Satan sending his message
[1:28:32] out to everybody got that he's sending
[1:28:37] his message out listen the devil hates
[1:28:42] our ways the devil hates us we have
[1:28:45] diverse ways we have ways that are
[1:28:47] different from the world and Satan hates
[1:28:50] that what he loves all that out there he
[1:28:52] hates us when we do the things that God
[1:28:54] tells us to do so he hates these natural
[1:28:58] people but now watch what happened and
[1:29:02] the rulers of every people have ever
[1:29:04] promised according to the writing there
[1:29:05] of them to ever people after their
[1:29:06] language and the name of King Soros was
[1:29:09] it written and sealed with the king's
[1:29:11] ring and the letters were sent by
[1:29:13] posting to all the king's provinces to
[1:29:15] destroy the killing caused the perish
[1:29:16] because you know what the letter killeth
[1:29:20] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:29:22] life both young he's going to destroy
[1:29:25] all Jews young and old little children
[1:29:27] women in one day it's gonna be on the
[1:29:31] 13th day of the 12th month which is the
[1:29:33] month a doll ready to take the spoil of
[1:29:34] them for a pray the copy of the writings
[1:29:37] because look if we don't do what God
[1:29:38] says this thing around here is gonna
[1:29:40] kill us and you know what the devil is
[1:29:43] going to use this to kill us with it
[1:29:47] that's the devil gonna use nasty words
[1:29:50] and all the different things out there
[1:29:51] to kill us with no he's gonna take this
[1:29:53] right here and say oh you're okay don't
[1:29:54] worry about it don't worry you come
[1:29:56] Church when you want to listen to
[1:29:59] prophet and when you won't it really
[1:30:01] doesn't matter it just just make sure
[1:30:04] you read your Bible do your little
[1:30:05] devotion every day that's not what God
[1:30:08] wants he wants a Living Word the copy of
[1:30:12] the writings for a commandment to be
[1:30:14] given in every province was published
[1:30:15] unto all the people that they should be
[1:30:17] ready against that day the post went out
[1:30:20] being hastened by the Kings commandment
[1:30:21] and the decree was given in Shushan the
[1:30:23] palace and the king and Haman sat down
[1:30:25] to drink but the City of Shushan was
[1:30:26] perplexed now we're gonna stop right
[1:30:29] there because it's 3:30 I'm not gonna go
[1:30:31] any further because we got communion to
[1:30:33] take and a meeting so we've come up this
[1:30:37] far we've had we've got Mordechai
[1:30:40] we've got Esther and Mordecai coming
[1:30:42] together we got the bride and the
[1:30:44] Prophet together now we've got the devil
[1:30:47] involved all right we got the devil
[1:30:50] involved and what's going to happen is
[1:30:52] is this is a whole key to it because God
[1:30:55] can't change this right here God can't
[1:30:59] change this word right you either live
[1:31:04] by it or die by it
[1:31:05] can't change it well that's what happens
[1:31:08] in Onan to this story because what
[1:31:11] they're going to do is is they're going
[1:31:13] to tell the king that Haman is going to
[1:31:16] destroy this whole Jewish Kingdom and
[1:31:20] the King lifts Adam and says I can't
[1:31:23] change my word that was the whole
[1:31:25] kingdom of the Medes and Persians when
[1:31:27] the Medes and Persians came into power
[1:31:28] when the when the word of the king was
[1:31:31] written it could not be altered
[1:31:34] this word can't be altered there's going
[1:31:37] to be billions of people that die
[1:31:39] because of this right here and go to
[1:31:42] hell but to me and you we know what it
[1:31:45] is it's a living word well that's what's
[1:31:47] gonna happen when we come to this place
[1:31:49] where the king says I can't change but
[1:31:53] you know what he done he gave them a
[1:31:55] chance to defend their self
[1:31:59] he gives us a chance to defend ourselves
[1:32:04] what he give us he give the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] the real Victor is the baptism of the
[1:32:18] holy God can't change the word brother
[1:32:21] Donny but he sure can't let you defend
[1:32:25] yourself by this word of God right here
[1:32:28] that's gonna kill people but the King's
[1:32:33] gonna say look there's nothing I can do
[1:32:35] and you're gonna see in the story a
[1:32:37] little bit later this is the great part
[1:32:38] of the story that Esther was not called
[1:32:42] by the King so you can't go in to see
[1:32:45] the King without the King calling you
[1:32:48] certain death but Esther says if I die I
[1:32:53] die if I live I live I'm going in to see
[1:32:56] that King because my people are gonna
[1:32:58] die and what happens when she walks into
[1:33:04] the room she took her character into
[1:33:10] that room and sister Freda there's no
[1:33:13] way that that King was gonna kill her he
[1:33:17] was so happy to see her he said whatever
[1:33:19] you want and listen folks that's what
[1:33:22] God's telling us today whatever you want
[1:33:26] not to half my kingdom Earth there ain't
[1:33:29] no King of Kings Lord of lords
[1:33:36] that's wonderful
[1:33:39] she has him
[1:33:43] and it's not what I said brother ray
[1:33:46] that's what God said I'm just telling
[1:33:49] you what God said that the bride of
[1:33:52] Jesus Christ I was thinking about that
[1:33:53] this morning when brother Nelson King of
[1:33:55] Kings Lord Lord go all the way back to
[1:33:57] the book of Genesis before the fall Eve
[1:34:00] didn't have a name her name was Adam it
[1:34:10] was an uppercase in a lowercase that
[1:34:13] hasn't happened yet but what to restore
[1:34:16] back to restore back in Redemption it's
[1:34:20] King of Kings my bride is back again and
[1:34:27] not just back again sitting with
[1:34:29] twiddling our thumbs no power and
[1:34:32] authority has been given to me and you
[1:34:36] by the word of God let's stand to our
[1:34:38] feet musicians coming will sing us we'll
[1:34:46] just sing a song give somebody an
[1:34:47] opportunity to come and then brother
[1:34:49] Dale will come and we'll take communion
[1:34:50] we're gonna take communion here and
[1:34:51] downstairs so be reverent love you with
[1:35:01] the love of the Lord we thank you for
[1:35:03] all the people all you all that we do
[1:35:05] we've assembled a wonderful group of
[1:35:07] people I was thinking about yesterday
[1:35:13] God will give you the desire of your
[1:35:15] heart
[1:35:15] and that right and he's the only one
[1:35:18] that knows your heart but if you'll have
[1:35:21] brother Boyd if you'll have the desire
[1:35:22] of your heart to want to come to church
[1:35:24] regardless of the virus regardless of
[1:35:26] all these different whatever's whatever
[1:35:29] he'll know the desire of your heart he
[1:35:33] knows that sometimes you just want to
[1:35:34] show up or you don't want to show up but
[1:35:37] he knows the deep desire of a heart and
[1:35:39] a deep desire there's the other extra
[1:35:40] and the other desire of his heart is he
[1:35:44] knows the desire of your heart that King
[1:35:47] when you get over into the over end of
[1:35:49] this story
[1:35:49] you see Esther there comes another
[1:35:52] Esther you see Esther coming on the
[1:35:54] scene
[1:35:55] and you see the king backing off and
[1:36:00] that's what I love about that story it's
[1:36:01] not that the King but you know what that
[1:36:03] makes the King greater because he's got
[1:36:04] a queen that has his mind they don't
[1:36:09] have to quarrel about things when she
