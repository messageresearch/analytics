[6:47] could be in the house of the Lord this
[6:48] evening
[6:51] so y'all just
[6:53] pray for me tonight
[6:55] I heard there was a little
[6:58] a little mix up on who was going to
[6:59] preach tonight
[7:01] brother Dale said everybody was asking
[7:03] who's going to preach
[7:06] I guess everybody
[7:09] yes
[7:11] I was going to say it was like David
[7:13] everybody was
[7:15] everybody was Samuel came to anoint the
[7:18] king they started looking for everybody
[7:19] and it's like ain't there one more we've
[7:21] missed everybody
[7:24] I said yeah the least in the bunch is
[7:27] around
[7:28] littlest
[7:30] I said the least I didn't say that I
[7:32] didn't say the littlest
[7:34] I said the least in the bunch
[7:40] I believe that's what Apostle Paul said
[7:42] that he was the least among all the
[7:44] saints
[7:46] so it's good to be the the least
[7:50] you just raise yourself up to where God
[7:52] puts you
[7:53] amen amen appreciate the Lord tonight
[7:56] we're going to be looking in Ephesians
[7:58] chapter 6.
[8:00] and uh
[8:02] you know sometimes you don't know
[8:04] you feel like you don't know what to say
[8:06] and other times you because you're like
[8:08] well I don't have anything you don't
[8:09] feel like there's anything
[8:11] and then other times you feel like
[8:13] you're trying to narrow it down to
[8:14] something to say
[8:16] and uh
[8:18] I don't know if you ever heard the
[8:19] little story about the
[8:20] the old blind black preacher
[8:23] and you know the the black people used
[8:24] to have they used to have readers
[8:27] well he had he had somebody to read the
[8:29] scripture for him all the time and had
[8:31] this young man that was going to get up
[8:32] to read the scripture for him and he
[8:33] asked the preacher said where do you
[8:35] want me to read from and he said just
[8:37] read anywhere he said it's all got to be
[8:39] preached
[8:41] so you know sometimes you wonder where
[8:42] you where you want where do we need to
[8:44] be it's like well it's always got to be
[8:46] preached but you know we want to narrow
[8:47] it down to something but uh
[8:50] it's just something
[8:52] kind of been looking at
[8:54] and uh we're just going to Bow our heads
[8:56] and uh before we read the scripture not
[8:59] and get started and
[9:00] just uh
[9:02] just give the Lord the preeminence in
[9:04] the service
[9:06] dear heavenly father we thank you for

[10:01] what's on each heart tonight
[10:03] and father we we realize that we are
[10:07] so
[10:10] so lacking in ability Lord or we don't
[10:13] have any we don't have the ability to to

[10:31] day of Pentecost Lord just have us be in
[10:33] one mind and one Accord Lord Jesus that
[10:36] you can come and administer in a special
[10:38] way Lord we just commit all things to

[10:44] amen Ephesians chapter 6 and
[10:48] verse 10.
[10:50] says finally my brethren be strong in
[10:52] the Lord and in the power of His might
[10:54] says put on the whole armor of God that
[10:56] you may be able to stand against The
[10:58] Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not
[11:00] against flesh and blood but against
[11:02] principalities against Powers against
[11:03] rulers of the darkness of this world
[11:05] against spiritual wickedness in high
[11:07] places
[11:08] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[11:11] of God that you may be able to withstand
[11:13] in the evil day and having done all to
[11:15] stand stand therefore having your loins
[11:18] gird about with truth and having on the
[11:20] breastplate of righteousness and your
[11:23] feet shot with the preparation of the
[11:25] gospel of peace above all taking the
[11:27] shield of Faith wherewith he shall be
[11:29] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[11:31] the wicked and take the helmet of
[11:32] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[11:34] which is the word of God praying always
[11:37] with all prayer and supplication in the
[11:39] spirit and watching there unto with all
[11:42] perseverance and supplication for All
[11:45] Saints amen the Lord bless the reading
[11:48] of the word you may be seated
[11:50] so
[11:54] you know just pray for me this evening
[11:56] but a lot of things though
[11:58] try to
[12:00] cover but uh
[12:03] one of the things that that stood out to
[12:07] me about this
[12:09] was
[12:10] inner brother Branham
[12:11] speaking of the Ephesian Church
[12:15] he said the Ephesian Church
[12:18] was a was a solid Church
[12:21] right you know he said that uh they were
[12:24] well taught he said that Paul could tell
[12:27] teach them things taught them things
[12:29] that he couldn't teach the other
[12:31] churches he didn't have the problems
[12:32] with the Ephesians that he had with the
[12:34] Corinthian Church you know brother Adam
[12:36] said that the
[12:38] um Ephesians had had tongues and
[12:41] everything but he said they had it all
[12:42] in order and it didn't have any of those
[12:44] uh problems in uh
[12:47] somebody get me some water fuel don't
[12:49] mind
[12:51] sorry sorry
[12:52] but uh
[12:54] anyway
[12:55] um
[12:56] you know you look at these things and
[12:59] you look at the book of Ephesians and
[13:01] what stands out to me is you look at the
[13:04] things that Paul wrote has wrote to the
[13:06] church in in the book of Ephesians and
[13:08] you go back to chapter one and and there
[13:10] he he speaks about how we were chosen in
[13:14] him before the foundation of the world
[13:16] and you know you go through and he talks
[13:18] about the mystery of the will of God and
[13:20] and all the things that he lays out
[13:21] through the the whole book of Ephesians
[13:24] and you know brother around type
[13:25] divisions as the uh parallels Joshua
[13:28] showing the position placing of the
[13:31] believer and their uh placing and their
[13:35] promise and their possession and you
[13:37] know it's so amazing that he goes
[13:39] through and explains all these great
[13:40] Mysteries all the way through the the
[13:42] scripture and you know many things that
[13:44] we look at and it's just amazing the uh
[13:47] the wealth of of information and
[13:50] knowledge not just as to know something
[13:53] but it's what God was showing the people
[13:55] in the book of Ephesians and I want to
[13:59] say all that because you look at all
[14:00] these things and we say well you know
[14:02] they were great and taught and had all
[14:04] these great things but at the end of all
[14:06] that that Paul said to the Ephesians he
[14:09] gets to the end and he says finally my
[14:11] brother Brethren be strong in the Lord
[14:13] and in the power of His might well you
[14:16] would think that after he spent all that
[14:17] time telling about how predestinated
[14:19] they were and all the things that he
[14:21] went through you think they were they
[14:22] were at a place
[14:24] you think they were fortified but then
[14:27] he stands there and says finally my
[14:29] brethren be strong in the Lord
[14:31] thank you buddy
[14:38] but uh anyway he goes you know he's he's
[14:40] speaking he says then he tells them to
[14:42] put on the whole armor of God well you
[14:45] would think that would be something you
[14:46] you would cover in the beginning and not
[14:48] in the end
[14:53] so you know it's a
[14:54] amazing little thing that you know
[14:56] because after you go through and you can
[14:59] talk about how predestinated you are and
[15:01] all these great Mysteries and everything
[15:03] but that's when the devil is going to
[15:05] attack you
[15:07] you know brother Branham said in Christ
[15:08] the mystery he said all hell is against
[15:11] this teaching he said all hails against
[15:14] this truth well the more truth you have
[15:16] the more the devil's going to attack you
[15:18] because that's where the truth is and so
[15:20] that's the reason I think that Paul this
[15:22] at the end he says now finally my
[15:25] brethren be strong in the Lord why
[15:28] because you know these things you've
[15:30] been taught these things that's where
[15:31] the battle is going to take place
[15:33] because then now you now you see where
[15:36] you're going to have to fight but says
[15:38] but he says put on this whole armor
[15:41] so there's a whole armor for us to put
[15:43] on
[15:44] because you know what that now we
[15:46] understand he said that you can
[15:48] wavestand The Wiles of the devil right
[15:50] right so we know that's where the tricks
[15:52] of the devil are going to come in
[15:53] because the devil's not trying to do
[15:55] away with the word
[15:57] but he's trying to pervert the word
[15:59] that's that's his whole plan from the
[16:01] beginning as he's tried to pervert the
[16:03] word and so we understand that's where
[16:05] he's his attack is but it that's what
[16:08] while Paul was expounding to the and
[16:13] trying to push to the
[16:15] Ephesians be strong
[16:18] and take on the armor of God and and so
[16:21] you withstand
[16:24] so he says for wrestle not against flesh
[16:26] and blood against principalities against
[16:28] powers
[16:30] you know against the rulers of the
[16:32] darkness get spiritual wickedness in
[16:35] high places
[16:36] you know and one of the scripture that
[16:38] stands at you and Paul said he said but
[16:40] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[16:42] carnal he said But Mighty through God to
[16:44] the pulling down the strongholds so
[16:46] there's a understanding that you know we
[16:48] have to be equipped to fight
[16:51] and your brother Benham goes through and
[16:53] and there's many many uh stories and and
[16:57] things and uh one of them is uh
[16:59] restoration of the broad tree here uh
[17:02] brother Joe it's uh our brother Anderson
[17:05] it's uh number one here
[17:08] and then you know brothers and I'm sure
[17:10] many of you have read this before but
[17:12] you know this is the one one of the uh
[17:14] quotes that always stands out to me you
[17:16] know brother Brown was talking about the
[17:17] about the man that was going through
[17:19] training he said he was standing there
[17:20] with pockets full of stand and
[17:22] everything where he had to hold his head
[17:25] down so low the live machine gun fire
[17:27] was going right over his head where he
[17:29] crawled through Barbed wires and things
[17:30] taking a rigid training
[17:34] and he said well you know that's what
[17:36] we're doing here but now he said it's a
[17:38] lot different on the battle front he
[17:40] said that machine gun is timed train
[17:42] right at a certain level but on the
[17:43] Battlefront he said it would come down
[17:46] up it could come up or down
[17:48] so that's a little different there you
[17:50] see but we have to well this is training
[17:52] here but out there you're on the
[17:54] Battlefront
[17:55] so we understand that this is a training
[17:59] and you you know this is where the the
[18:01] training and you know brother random
[18:03] goes on and he was speaking of uh young
[18:06] man he said it he said he didn't
[18:07] understand what you know going through
[18:08] training having to carry a 90 pound pack
[18:10] and and all the things that he had to go
[18:12] through but he said you know when he got
[18:14] on the battlefield then he realized all
[18:16] the training that he had to go through
[18:17] had a purpose and all the things that he
[18:20] went through had to have a uh
[18:23] a a
[18:24] uh a need when he got on the battlefield
[18:27] and he said he was thankful for it when
[18:29] he got on the battlefield because that's
[18:31] when it was really needful and it come
[18:32] into into uh
[18:35] into use and so we understand there's
[18:37] many many things that we have to go
[18:40] through and we understand this is the
[18:41] this is the fight and this is where our
[18:43] training takes place and you know
[18:45] there's many things that you go through
[18:47] and we have uh training
[18:51] and uh
[18:53] I was when I was speaking up brother
[18:55] gadson's I was I was speaking on this
[18:58] and talking about the armor of God and
[19:00] how we how we become equipped and all
[19:03] the things that God has given us and
[19:06] one of the little story
[19:09] it comes to mind and
[19:11] how do you get I get to share with him
[19:13] but it was on it was on my mind and I'm
[19:15] going to share it tonight his brother
[19:16] Donnie and brother Donnie was talking
[19:18] about going through the Marine Corps
[19:19] boot camp and you know he's talking
[19:21] about all these guys you know who said
[19:22] oh I can't handle this I can't handle
[19:24] this
[19:25] and he said well he said y'all didn't
[19:26] live with TJ fallbush
[19:29] he said when he got to boot camp he said
[19:31] it wasn't it wasn't too hard
[19:33] he said there was a lot because see he
[19:35] had been trained
[19:37] and and you know he had been through had
[19:39] an experience with something that when
[19:40] he got to boot camp and I'm not saying
[19:42] boot Camp's easy and I I certainly
[19:44] wouldn't want to go through it myself
[19:45] and I appreciate everybody that's been
[19:47] through it and all the ones that have
[19:49] stood and and fought
[19:52] and and done and done their part for our
[19:54] nation
[19:56] but I tell you what you know Donnie said
[19:58] you know those guys are you know they
[19:59] just freaking out and having a hard time
[20:01] he said you'd have never live with TJ
[20:02] fallbush
[20:05] so yeah I mean there's a but you know
[20:06] because but you know when you go through
[20:09] something that's difficult you know well
[20:10] you can't make it
[20:12] I can't make it but you know when you
[20:14] get through it
[20:15] then when you look at that then
[20:18] people sometimes they'll say well I've
[20:20] been through hard times and they said
[20:23] well God's brought me through
[20:25] well then you know what there should be
[20:27] an anchor sat down inside of you that
[20:30] when you come to something that's
[20:31] difficult because one of the things that
[20:33] uh I want to get to a little bit later
[20:35] on is speaking on on the life of David
[20:38] but when you get to a place there ought
[20:40] to be an anchor sat down and says you
[20:42] know what I've I've made it through this
[20:44] and if God has met this need then guess
[20:47] what the next need I have he'll he's
[20:49] there to meet it again
[20:52] so because you know what because we see
[20:55] we say well God has because we don't
[20:58] understand we don't realize it you know
[21:00] he was talking about just like that
[21:01] little mouse in in the grain Gardeners
[21:04] of of Egypt and he was standing there
[21:06] saying I better eat sparingly because I
[21:08] may run out or he's talking about that
[21:10] little fish in the ocean said I better
[21:12] just sip on the water because I might
[21:14] run out because see but he said he said
[21:16] ask that your joy might be full so if if
[21:20] we have a need then he said Paul said my
[21:23] God shall supply all your needs
[21:25] according to his riches in glory and he
[21:27] said he said that's a as the story that
[21:30] I've told many times in one of my
[21:31] favorite quotes in the message and if uh
[21:35] is brother brother man speaking on a
[21:37] message why 1963 and he talks about that
[21:41] lady that had uh had a son that had went
[21:44] to India and you know he'd become an
[21:46] electrical engineer and he made all this
[21:47] money and he kept sending her postcards
[21:50] back and you know she was sticking to
[21:51] the little postcard in her Bible and she
[21:53] kept putting them in there and you know
[21:55] she got to the place where she was so
[21:57] poor she had to turn was trying to find
[21:59] hell because she was starving to death
[22:01] and had nothing and then you know people
[22:04] come and was checking on her was asking
[22:05] her don't you have any you know family
[22:07] any help yeah I have a son who sends me
[22:10] postcards all the time and he said but
[22:12] you know
[22:13] um but you know don't he send you you
[22:16] know to help you out and he said well
[22:17] they probably don't know but if he did
[22:19] you know he probably would but I'm just
[22:22] so just so afraid to ask him for it
[22:25] and you know and I said well you get all
[22:28] these postcards with pretty pictures
[22:29] said oh yeah they're in my Bible and she
[22:32] said well can we see them and they said
[22:33] yeah so she opens up her Bible and pulls
[22:35] them out and started looking and they
[22:37] started looking at them and she thought
[22:39] they were postcards with pretty pictures
[22:40] but you know what they were they were
[22:42] Bank drafts why because he had converted
[22:45] that money from Indian money into
[22:47] American money and sent her the the bank
[22:49] drafts and you know brother man said
[22:51] what was it he said in the lids of her
[22:53] Bible she just thought they were pretty
[22:55] pictures but he said that was real value
[22:58] to her
[22:59] and he said brother and sister that's
[23:01] what I love so much he said brother and
[23:03] sister he said if anybody ever tries to
[23:05] tell you of a painted fire of Pentecost
[23:08] he said don't you believe him he said
[23:10] why because he's the same yesterday
[23:11] today and forever he said Paul said that
[23:15] it's unto you and to your children and
[23:17] to them that's a far off even as many as
[23:19] the Lord Our God shall call he said
[23:21] that's a bank draft on heaven
[23:25] and I tell you what he said he's the
[23:28] same yesterday today and forever and you
[23:30] know that's what I believe and that's
[23:31] why I see it because you know what we
[23:34] have and you know it's just a testimony
[23:36] to me because you know many uh maybe a
[23:39] lot of you don't know and you know we
[23:41] have just we've had to struggle
[23:43] financially for a while
[23:45] and you know sometimes we didn't know
[23:46] where we're going to where we're going
[23:48] to make it
[23:50] but you know what I had a promise to
[23:52] hold on to
[23:55] you know God didn't open up just poor
[23:57] poor money out but you know what he gave
[23:59] me the opportunity to make money
[24:03] he gave me he gave me a job that I I
[24:05] thank God you know it may not it may not
[24:07] be and and I understand work is a
[24:09] four-letter word
[24:14] you know what it's it's not it's not the
[24:16] you know if if we didn't have to work a
[24:19] lot of people wouldn't do it
[24:22] but you know what I thank God that I've
[24:24] got the job that I have because God gave
[24:27] it to me why because you know what I
[24:29] have a job that uses the skills because
[24:31] the scripture says that a man's gift
[24:33] will make a way for him
[24:36] so you know what God trains us and makes
[24:38] us go through situations in our life and
[24:41] to to bring us to a place that he can
[24:43] bless us
[24:47] you know sometimes we look at it and we
[24:49] you know the the story of the widow
[24:51] woman you know Elisha sat beside a brook
[24:53] and drank water and had the Ravens come
[24:55] and feed him
[24:57] until until the brook dried up
[25:00] well you know what that didn't prepare
[25:02] Elijah it prepared the widow woman to
[25:05] got to the place that she didn't have
[25:07] anything so that Elijah could come and
[25:09] bless her
[25:12] all right and then when they came then
[25:13] there was a time because she thought she
[25:15] was going to die she thought it was all
[25:16] over with
[25:18] but you know what he said come and make
[25:19] me a little cake first
[25:21] he said just give me a little bit of
[25:23] what you've got
[25:26] and he said he said if you just give me
[25:28] this little bit
[25:30] he said he said the mail will never run
[25:32] out he said the crew's oil will never
[25:34] run dry
[25:37] you know what it didn't fail you know
[25:39] what the old didn't fill up her house
[25:42] the building fill up her house but you
[25:43] know what she had everything she had
[25:45] need of
[25:51] it and so you know I understand and I
[25:53] thank God
[25:55] that he's allowed me to get to the you
[25:57] know and maybe maybe it was for my maybe
[25:59] it was for my training
[26:01] maybe it was for my good that I had to
[26:03] struggle that I had to go through these
[26:05] things but you know what I thank God
[26:07] that I can I can go to a job that people
[26:10] appreciate you that it's the people that
[26:13] you work for
[26:14] you know you see the things that you've
[26:16] had to go through in in the past and you
[26:19] come in there and you know maybe
[26:20] everything don't go your way or whatever
[26:21] but I tell you what it's a whole lot
[26:23] better than other places that I've
[26:25] worked
[26:27] and you know maybe other people would
[26:29] want to work there but I tell you what
[26:30] it just suits me fine
[26:34] okay so you know I thank God and you
[26:36] know because you see how God if you had
[26:38] to struggle and you've had to go through
[26:40] these things and God brings us to you
[26:42] then guess what the next time you have a
[26:44] struggle you have a problem guess what
[26:46] my God will meet your needs
[26:48] but you know what he's wanting somebody
[26:50] to take him out his word he wants
[26:53] somebody to believe him
[26:57] come on he said he said try me prove me
[26:59] and see if I don't open up the windows
[27:00] of heaven and pour you out a blessing
[27:02] that you can't contain but you know what
[27:04] you've got to trust him you've got to
[27:05] prove him
[27:08] and you know when you do that
[27:10] you get a blessing
[27:15] so we understand
[27:17] we're in a battle
[27:20] brother Brandon speaking an uncertain
[27:22] sound
[27:23] you know he said that that Soldier if
[27:25] he's a trained soldier
[27:27] he said he knows every sound of that
[27:29] trumpet just exactly what to do he's
[27:32] trained to that trumpet
[27:36] he said if a trump if a trumpet gives an
[27:38] uncertain sound he said the soldier
[27:40] won't know what to do only because he's
[27:42] trained to the trumpet of sound
[27:44] and he said and the Christian Soldiers
[27:46] trained to a trumpet a sound of a
[27:48] trumpet and that's the gospel trumpet
[27:49] the gospel the sound of the word of God
[27:52] the gospel trumpet
[27:55] he said and if one never knew the sound
[27:58] of the Gospel trumpet he'd be a bit
[28:00] confused if he didn't know what the word
[28:03] said and what the word taught just what
[28:06] the church said he'd be a bit confused
[28:07] when he heard the sound of the trumpet
[28:09] he wouldn't know how to prepare himself
[28:13] so we need to prepare ourselves and I'm
[28:16] so glad I have ears to hear
[28:19] you know I was telling them in
[28:21] brother gadson's at South Carolina
[28:24] you know there's been times in my life
[28:26] where I've had to
[28:28] hear things and you I didn't understand
[28:30] what they were saying and I told him I
[28:33] said Lord I said if this is the truth I
[28:35] said you need to show me this because I
[28:37] heard things and there were times that I
[28:39] heard things and you know what he just
[28:40] welled up inside of me and I was just
[28:42] like amen this something just clicks
[28:44] right off the bat I mean you're just I
[28:46] mean you see things and it just makes
[28:47] you just jump up and other times it's
[28:49] just like hitting the wall
[28:51] stop and you're like
[28:53] Lord what in the world
[28:55] and you know what I've had to carry that
[28:57] for years
[28:59] I carried questions in my mind about
[29:01] things that I heard that I couldn't
[29:03] place in the scripture
[29:05] and you know what it only takes the Holy
[29:07] Ghost but you know what it takes being
[29:09] sitting under a Ministry that can tell
[29:11] you these things that can break these
[29:13] things down that knows the word and if
[29:16] and through that then the Holy Ghost can
[29:19] come because you know he can't he
[29:20] doesn't Quicken non-seed he doesn't
[29:23] Quicken confusion but you know what if
[29:25] you have a desire he'll bring you to the
[29:28] place that somebody can show you the
[29:30] word and then you could you'll clear up
[29:32] all the confusion
[29:33] but you know what if you want to hide
[29:35] behind it then you stay right there
[29:41] and you know because I can you know I
[29:44] can still remember the day that the
[29:46] first day that I ever heard them the
[29:48] doctrine of the river of Jordan
[29:50] yeah
[29:51] and I tell you I still remember that day
[29:54] I still remember his on a Wednesday
[29:55] night and I still remember the brother
[29:57] that preached it and when I heard it it
[29:59] just stopped something inside of me and
[30:01] it just it stuck in my crawl
[30:05] as as the saying he is
[30:09] but you know what I couldn't I didn't
[30:10] understand it I couldn't prove it wrong
[30:12] but you know there was something to set
[30:14] inside of me and I couldn't understand
[30:16] it and I told the Lord I said if this is
[30:19] truth I said you show it to me
[30:21] but you know what I held on to that and
[30:24] you know what he showed me that it
[30:25] wasn't true
[30:27] and you know what it only takes
[30:28] sometimes it only takes a word or two
[30:30] and all of a sudden you know the whole
[30:32] Bible will just open up and you see it
[30:34] and I thank God because you know what
[30:36] it's through everything in the scripture
[30:39] the whole the whole scripture opened up
[30:41] that way
[30:43] you know I remember the first I used to
[30:45] read Romans 8.
[30:47] and you know and all of a sudden one day
[30:49] that scripture came open to me
[30:53] and then all of a sudden you know when I
[30:54] read Romans 8 I don't read it as I used
[30:57] to why because I see myself in Romans 8.
[31:00] when I read certain scriptures I see
[31:03] myself I don't see anybody else I see me
[31:07] when the scripture says when he said
[31:09] behold I send you Elijah the prophet I'm
[31:12] not looking for somebody else why
[31:14] because he came to me Glory
[31:18] I see that as a personal right a
[31:20] possession of mine
[31:23] a promise to me it didn't come to nobody
[31:26] else and I'm just as sure as I'm
[31:28] standing here as sure as sure as I'm
[31:30] standing here and in my right mind
[31:32] there's what mind I have
[31:35] I believe if there was nobody else that
[31:37] Elijah to come to he would have come to
[31:39] me
[31:44] I I would I believe he just if if God
[31:47] had to send him just for one he would
[31:48] have sent him for me
[31:51] and we all have to say it that same way
[31:53] that it's a personal possession it's a
[31:55] personal promise a personal revelation
[31:57] to you
[32:00] Lord
[32:01] that we can see what he's done for us
[32:14] and this is from trump it gives an
[32:16] uncertain sound
[32:17] he says a gospel trumpet he said the
[32:20] word of the Living God is the trumpet he
[32:22] said it don't mix with anything
[32:25] you know
[32:26] he said Paul speaking training a man to
[32:29] the sound
[32:31] you know whether to advance or with or
[32:33] withdraw or whichever way he said he had
[32:35] to know that sound right he had to learn
[32:37] the sound
[32:39] and I believe that's what God brings us
[32:41] to that we can hear the sound
[32:43] of the word the word come
[32:46] because I believe that's what happened
[32:48] something don't sound right something
[32:50] stops you yeah
[32:53] you know there's a brother said one time
[32:55] he said there's two two kinds of
[32:57] preachers that really really make me
[32:59] want to study this word he said really
[33:01] good ones and really bad ones
[33:05] because because if you've got somebody
[33:07] that's that's really knows this message
[33:09] you know because there's certain things
[33:11] that you see in the word and it's just
[33:12] like
[33:13] you you go back
[33:16] going back for seconds
[33:18] you know something's good
[33:20] and guess what you want to go back for
[33:22] some more
[33:23] and you want to go back for some more
[33:26] Richard always Richard always said the
[33:28] reason I was so much bigger than him
[33:29] said well by the time I got to the
[33:31] second saren was on the 23rds
[33:36] I can't help but he's slow
[33:42] it's what is what your desire is
[33:46] and that's reason I think there's a lot
[33:47] of people
[33:49] if if the sound of the of the word
[33:52] doesn't draw you
[33:54] or he doesn't cause you to to act
[33:58] then guess what there's something wrong
[33:59] with the sound of the of the trumpet to
[34:01] you
[34:03] because some people you know they say oh
[34:05] this is that's the greatest thing I've
[34:06] ever heard
[34:08] and you never see them again
[34:13] and they hear something and they say
[34:15] well I can't prove it wrong
[34:18] but I can't prove it right
[34:21] and they won't touch it
[34:24] yeah but you know the thing is is people
[34:25] don't know what what a prayer closet is
[34:27] anymore right right people people say
[34:29] well well you know we're just going to
[34:30] find it whatever brother Branham said
[34:32] we're just going to dig in the message
[34:33] and find it you know what the scripture
[34:36] tells us that it takes the Holy Ghost he
[34:38] said when the spirit of Truth has come
[34:40] he'll be the one to lead you and guide
[34:42] you because you know that's what
[34:44] happened a lot of people a lot of people
[34:45] have taken the prophet's message and
[34:47] they and they've read the message but
[34:49] the problem is without the Holy Ghost
[34:51] you'll get it confused you'll be
[34:53] confused
[34:56] why because you were born confused amen
[34:59] and that's all you God's confusion
[35:03] just like just like that man said he
[35:05] said I was born with with nothing I
[35:07] still got most of it left
[35:11] see we got we were born with confusion
[35:14] and it takes the Holy Ghost to clear
[35:15] that up are you going to stay in
[35:17] confusion you can have all the quotes
[35:20] that you want but it takes the Holy
[35:21] Ghost to make it line up
[35:25] because that's that's been the whole
[35:26] problem is people have not taken the
[35:28] Holy Ghost to line the word up
[35:31] and they say that's reason somebody says
[35:34] you know I appreciate brother Dale for
[35:35] one thing
[35:37] you ask him a question and if he don't
[35:39] know he'll tell you he don't know
[35:41] you don't have to hear it you don't have
[35:42] to listen to him try to talk for 20 30
[35:44] minutes to tell you nothing
[35:50] you know you know I always heard brother
[35:51] Dale boy he was he was intellectual he
[35:53] knew he knew this message it was nothing
[35:55] brother Dale didn't know he would he
[35:57] knew everything
[35:58] well he was he was the he was the
[36:00] message Superman
[36:02] I called him on the phone was asking him
[36:04] one time and asked him a question he
[36:06] said brother I don't know
[36:08] I was like hey I got to write that on my
[36:09] calendar brother Dale I could not answer
[36:12] a question for me
[36:16] but see that's the way people are
[36:17] they're trying to find an answer
[36:21] but you know what the answer is a person
[36:24] the answer is not on on in Pages because
[36:27] if you've got if you've got him who is
[36:30] the word he'll show you what the truth
[36:32] is he'll make it known to you
[36:37] no he says the army war he said it's
[36:40] always been War he said we never joined
[36:43] the church or come into the church to
[36:45] come into a picnic he said we must
[36:47] realize we're coming to a Battleground
[36:51] he said I never come for people to Pat
[36:53] me on the back and say brother about him
[36:54] you're a wonderful person no sir I come
[36:56] there with a shield on I don't need that
[36:59] Shield
[37:01] I don't need a shield for that I come
[37:03] with a helmet and the armor I come to
[37:05] fight fight for every inch of the ground
[37:07] God told Joshua every place The Souls of
[37:10] your foot Treads upon that I give you so
[37:13] foot footsteps means possession right
[37:16] and when the church gets to a place that
[37:18] compromises with Creeds compromises with
[37:20] the word and compromises with the world
[37:22] I mean then it's losing ground it's
[37:24] taking back
[37:25] he said what we need tonight is soldiers
[37:27] to possess every Divine promise of this
[37:30] Bible that God promised to the church
[37:32] the whole armor of God and to stand he
[37:35] said what we need soldiers not get a
[37:38] uniform for a dress parade it's always
[37:41] different
[37:45] so you can always always find ones that
[37:47] are all dressed up and look and look
[37:49] nice
[37:50] but you know what that's not where the
[37:52] work is right
[37:56] you know because they have they have
[37:58] their certain job to do but you know
[38:01] what they never get nasty they never get
[38:03] dirty
[38:06] you know people think
[38:09] and I and I appreciate them but you know
[38:11] sometimes you look at these guys that
[38:13] guard the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
[38:15] you know the honor guard
[38:18] and I appreciate and I understand they
[38:19] they do a lot I mean that's a difficult
[38:21] job
[38:23] because you know what they're there rain
[38:25] snow sleet tornado whatever is going on
[38:29] they're out there
[38:31] and you know they go through extensive
[38:34] background training and you know they
[38:35] have to make sure everything is just
[38:37] perfect for them to do that
[38:39] and you know if they do anything out of
[38:41] line in their personal life they don't
[38:43] they don't they won't be on the honor
[38:45] guard anymore
[38:46] but you know what
[38:48] that's not that's not the real real
[38:51] difficult job
[38:53] you know because the ones are the ones
[38:55] that are on the battlefield
[38:57] when you go into when you go into combat
[39:00] and you know you you read some of these
[39:02] these stories and and these books of of
[39:05] men that have have fought in and battle
[39:08] and and you see the the great uh
[39:13] the the great odds that they go up
[39:15] against and all the all the things that
[39:18] they and you know what they go right
[39:19] into that
[39:21] right and a lot of people you know a lot
[39:22] of them know you know we're not coming
[39:24] back but you know you know they go in
[39:27] into that and they have this one
[39:28] mentality and many of them and you
[39:31] either go in and under certain
[39:32] situations but you know they say we'll
[39:34] never leave a man behind because you
[39:36] know whatever our objective is he said
[39:38] well I'll die together he said well I'll
[39:40] either come home or we'll all die there
[39:42] and you know that's that's the way they
[39:44] why because they have sold out to that
[39:46] mentality and it's all for all of us or
[39:49] none
[39:51] and you know that's that's the way it is
[39:53] if you're if you're in this battle if
[39:54] you're in this war you know we're all
[39:56] we're all into this together it's not
[39:59] it's not just mine and it's yours
[40:02] no we're if we're all the body of Christ
[40:04] how much more should we be drawn
[40:06] together if these if these men can go in
[40:09] there and they're going to die the death
[40:10] and they're going to give up everything
[40:12] to be together
[40:15] and you know sometimes they say well
[40:17] this is my brother and I don't even know
[40:18] him
[40:21] you know sometimes that's the way when
[40:22] you when you hear about people
[40:24] especially if somebody has a need
[40:27] you know sometimes you hear about
[40:28] somebody that that that's going through
[40:30] something
[40:32] and you know I think why would I would
[40:35] how would I pray if that was me
[40:38] how would I pray if if I knew somebody
[40:41] if that was somebody that was close to
[40:43] me
[40:45] you know because you you think about
[40:47] that because you know what that's that's
[40:48] the kind of person that I want praying
[40:50] for me I want somebody to really think
[40:53] if I've got a problem if I have a need I
[40:55] want somebody to really approach God
[40:58] not just in a passing manner but I want
[41:01] somebody to actually really try to touch
[41:03] the Throne of God
[41:05] damn it and so you know that's the way
[41:07] it is because you know brother Brandon
[41:09] said if we see one that's backslidden
[41:11] you know we supposed to go after them
[41:12] the scripture tells us to go after them
[41:17] you know to to have a heart of
[41:19] compassion for them
[41:24] scripture tells us that that love will
[41:26] cover a multitude of sins
[41:30] you know the scripture tells us he had
[41:32] we that are weak ought to Bear them or
[41:34] we are that are strong ought to Bear the
[41:35] infirmities of those that are weak
[41:39] see we're supposed to be the ones
[41:41] working together to help those that that
[41:43] have a need
[41:45] and not just try to write them off
[41:48] because that's the kind of battle we
[41:50] have
[41:52] we have to fight
[41:59] y'all just pray for me but
[42:01] here
[42:04] so we're speaking of
[42:06] this battle
[42:09] putting on this armor
[42:11] brother Brown said in Divine love and
[42:13] Sovereign Grace he said he said we're
[42:15] just contending Against The Wiles of the
[42:17] devil
[42:18] he said against Buddhism against
[42:20] and the hundreds of idols
[42:22] and gods of the world and
[42:24] I told him I said I said there's
[42:26] hundreds and thousands of gods in the
[42:28] world and America has their own and they
[42:31] appropriate
[42:32] appropriately entitled it American Idol
[42:40] yeah I mean they come up with something
[42:41] that you know you see people that you
[42:43] you think that are you know kind of
[42:47] decent and smart or whatever but you
[42:49] know they can't miss that
[42:53] and then you have other things like
[42:56] Dancing with the Stars
[42:58] you know I mean that just sucks some in
[43:00] you know I would much rather be shouting
[43:02] with the Stars because that's why job
[43:04] God told job you know where were you
[43:06] when the sons of God sang together in
[43:08] this all the stars shouted for joy
[43:10] you know that's where I'd want to be
[43:12] with with that instead of dancing with
[43:14] something no I am a star
[43:17] we are one of the Stars
[43:21] you know instead of just doing all this
[43:25] we say it's something that the the world
[43:28] has to occupy its time
[43:31] again the god of America
[43:34] money and and women and all these type
[43:37] things
[43:38] but you know we have something to
[43:40] contend he said we're contending that
[43:41] there's one true Living God and he's
[43:44] just as live tonight as he ever was he
[43:47] said that we're that we're not here just
[43:49] with a fictitious belief we're not here
[43:52] all emotionally wrapped up in some
[43:53] emotion or psychology or enthusiasm he
[43:57] said we're here in the presence of the
[43:58] living resurrected Jesus Christ who
[44:01] stands with us each night and proves
[44:03] himself to be alive raised from the dead
[44:05] and is here with us now
[44:09] so that's what we have is we have one
[44:11] that's raised from the dead
[44:13] because you know what everybody has
[44:15] their own has their own God that has
[44:19] their own Idol but you know what
[44:21] whatever your idol is is what takes up
[44:23] your time what means the most to you
[44:30] and you know the world is full of them
[44:34] you know it's it's so amazing at the
[44:36] hour that we live in and we how we see
[44:39] how
[44:40] the the world is falling apart and how
[44:44] all these things are taking place but
[44:45] you know what it just tells us that
[44:47] we're in the end time it tells us that
[44:49] we're getting close to the end why
[44:50] because it should be bringing Joy To Us
[44:54] but you know we see how all these things
[44:56] so you know
[44:57] never never in a million years would you
[44:59] take common decent thinking people would
[45:01] be in the in the kind of condition the
[45:03] world's in
[45:06] you know I mean wait because the
[45:09] Constitution that was written that the
[45:11] way you have our have our basis on the
[45:13] Declaration of Independence don't mean
[45:15] anything anymore why because it you know
[45:18] because the laws have become just
[45:20] whatever everybody wants it to be we can
[45:22] just change the law and make it whatever
[45:23] and just wait just wipe everything off
[45:26] and just sweep it under the rug because
[45:28] it doesn't mean any more anything
[45:30] anymore
[45:32] because you know it's come to the point
[45:34] where immoral immoral and acts and Decay
[45:37] and all this type of stuff you know
[45:39] that's what's that's what's being
[45:40] protected by the law
[45:42] but anything anything that you have a
[45:44] moral stand for anything you know what
[45:46] you don't have a right to do that
[45:48] anymore
[45:49] it'll be all of that's being taken away
[45:51] from you
[45:52] that's the way it's got
[45:58] ta either gonna stay in what God's law
[46:00] we're going to stand with man's law
[46:02] why because you're going to have to
[46:03] stand with that
[46:04] here's one of the things that uh one of
[46:07] the things I was looking at was you know
[46:09] Jesus was standing there you know the
[46:11] the disciples you know the the Pharisees
[46:14] and the sages and they all came the
[46:15] scribes and all came to Jesus you know
[46:17] and and they wanted to know they want to
[46:19] say why do your disciples
[46:21] he said why do they uh
[46:24] you know offend our traditions
[46:27] whether they turn down our traditions
[46:29] you know he said they they eat they eat
[46:31] bread with dirty hands
[46:35] you know they're not following our laws
[46:37] all these Traditions all these great
[46:38] things that that we've built up that
[46:39] we've been that means so much to us
[46:42] and Jesus told them said he said why is
[46:44] it that y'all that do away with the with
[46:47] the word of God
[46:49] why have you done away with these things
[46:51] he said why have you why did are you
[46:53] preaching the Commandments of men as as
[46:56] the law as the word of God
[47:01] and see people people have done away
[47:03] with all these things even people that
[47:05] supposedly claim to believe believe the
[47:07] word of God believe this message and
[47:10] they can just wipe it under I'll wipe it
[47:11] under the rug or just put it in the
[47:13] closet and just leave all kinds of stuff
[47:16] but you know what that's the way it's
[47:18] supposed to be why because that's the
[47:21] time that we're living in that we're
[47:22] going to have to stand up and give an
[47:23] account for these things
[47:27] brother Brown said this is trumpet gives
[47:29] an uncertain sound he said the great
[47:31] church is armored by the word he said
[47:33] now when Jesus come did he use that same
[47:36] armor he certainly did when Jesus come
[47:38] to him and all of his strength he said
[47:40] if thou be the Son of God do certain
[47:42] certain things he said it is written
[47:43] right back to the word he said Satan
[47:46] tried him a little higher right back to
[47:47] the word there he remained upon that
[47:48] word showing us an example
[47:52] said first first
[47:54] Saint John 14 13 said I give you an
[47:56] example and that is an example that we
[47:58] should live emphatically we should
[48:00] perfectly put our trust in the word of
[48:02] God and let everything else be a lie
[48:04] there's one thing that's certain God
[48:06] made the promise God's going to keep the
[48:08] promise they say how can this thing
[48:10] happen how can he get a bunch of people
[48:12] together with rapturing grace to go up
[48:14] he said I don't know how he'll do it
[48:16] it's not my business as to how he'll do
[48:18] it it's my business just to be ready for
[48:21] it he promised it's going to happen
[48:25] so how's he going to do it I don't know
[48:28] but but like you said it's our job to be
[48:30] ready
[48:31] it's our it's our job to have faith in
[48:33] it
[48:35] you know he said to put on this armor
[48:38] he said the word is a armor he said he
[48:41] said you've got to put on it he said but
[48:43] you've got to put your trust in the word
[48:45] of God you've got to have trust in your
[48:47] armor
[48:48] because you can be armored with it but
[48:50] you know what if you don't know how it
[48:52] works and if you don't have faith in it
[48:53] it won't work for you
[48:59] he says put on the whole armor of God
[49:01] that you may be able to stand The Wiles
[49:03] of the devil which is the tricks of the
[49:05] devil
[49:06] and he says you know how can I overcome
[49:08] he says overcome it's a recognize the
[49:10] devil that every one of his tricks he
[49:13] said you must know that he's a devil
[49:14] then at the same time you must recognize
[49:17] him and know that he's the devil and
[49:19] he's against you then to overcome you
[49:22] must recognize that God in you is
[49:24] greater and mightier than he is that the
[49:26] one that's in you has already overcome
[49:28] him and by his grace you're more than a
[49:31] match for him amen that's real
[49:33] overcoming
[49:37] see if you if you understand the the
[49:39] armor then you can trust in that armor
[49:42] sure put your faith in it know that he's
[49:45] more than a man you're more than a match
[49:47] for him
[49:50] and he's speaking of taking on
[49:52] he says put on the whole armor of God
[49:54] you may be able to stand in the evil day
[49:58] having all the having all to do to stand
[50:03] you know that's our day
[50:04] Elijah
[50:06] Malachi 4 said a great and terrible day
[50:08] so we know that we're in this great
[50:09] terrible day
[50:11] it's a great day for some it's a
[50:12] terrible day for others it's how you
[50:14] look at it it's a great day
[50:18] you know everybody asks me all the time
[50:20] how are you doing how you feeling I'm
[50:22] doing great wonderful fantastic super
[50:27] why because you know what I don't care
[50:28] how bad the day goes you know what if
[50:31] you keep telling everybody you're having
[50:32] a great day guess what you'll have a
[50:33] great day
[50:37] because you know what you you make and
[50:39] everybody says well you know what it's
[50:40] just gonna get worse no it's not
[50:43] you got a crystal ball
[50:46] do you know what's going to happen in
[50:48] the future
[50:50] well I just know no you don't you're
[50:52] just saying that
[50:54] that's it but if you don't you say it's
[50:56] gonna be a great day but you know what
[50:57] whatever is going to take place you know
[51:00] what you can even no matter what happens
[51:03] you can see the great in it you see is
[51:05] how wonderful it is
[51:07] you can see the God's grace in it God's
[51:10] blessing in it
[51:14] so no matter how bad it how bad it looks
[51:17] it's a good day
[51:20] like like one fell at work says he said
[51:23] I'm on the right side of the dirt it's a
[51:25] good day
[51:31] Christ the mystery
[51:33] so you know what hey speaking of
[51:36] he said the blood he said church is the
[51:39] blood of Christ by the spirit because
[51:41] the life is in the blood
[51:42] he said that's the baptism of the Holy
[51:44] Ghost that baptizes us into the body
[51:46] they reckon they recognizes only his
[51:48] body his flesh his word denomination
[51:50] won't ever touch that it's a revelation
[51:53] she knows it's he said so did even know
[51:56] it but she failed but this one knows it
[51:58] and won't fall she's ordained to it
[52:00] Hallelujah she's ordained not to fall
[52:02] she won't fail she's predestinated to it
[52:07] you know what you're you're have this if
[52:10] you're an armor and you're equipped then
[52:12] you know what you can't fail because you
[52:14] said you're predestinated to it
[52:18] you know an invisible union he says you
[52:20] know you're The Virtuous bride washed in
[52:22] the blood precious virtuous sin sinless
[52:26] Son of God standing with a pure
[52:27] unadulterated word bride word that he
[52:30] Washed by the Water of his own blood
[52:32] that become flesh and manifested that he
[52:35] might take you which were predestinated
[52:37] in the bosom of the father from the
[52:38] beginning
[52:42] so yeah
[52:43] I don't know about you but I enjoy
[52:45] reading these things
[52:48] you say well you know
[52:50] things these are just these are just
[52:51] leftovers they just get second helpings
[52:54] of them
[52:57] but see it's it's something that's a you
[52:59] see these things it's a blessing to you
[53:01] and so he says
[53:05] he says
[53:08] he said have your loins gird about with
[53:10] truth
[53:12] and having on the breastplate of
[53:13] righteousness have your feet shod with
[53:16] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[53:18] you know he says that when he talks
[53:20] about
[53:21] he said having your loins gird about
[53:23] with truth
[53:25] brother Graham says in Israel in the Red
[53:27] Sea he said you know that's the belt
[53:29] that holds it all together your loins
[53:31] gird about with truth he said in the day
[53:33] brother he said there's all kind of ism
[53:34] and fanaticism it's time to gird
[53:37] yourself with truth hallelujah Jesus
[53:39] said I am the truth the way in the life
[53:42] he said knowing where you're standing
[53:43] there it is holding it all together
[53:47] you know brother Branham I was thinking
[53:49] about where brother man and uh
[53:51] it was it Christ the mystery there what
[53:53] he talks about the word to the church
[53:54] and you know he talks about drawing up
[53:56] closer together hey you know he said
[53:58] that brother had to dream about the
[54:00] buckler you know he talked about drawing
[54:01] up closer together being being drawn
[54:04] together being gerd about with truth and
[54:08] you know where in your loins you know in
[54:09] the loins area that's where that's where
[54:11] your strength is
[54:13] you know that in your in the legs and
[54:14] everything and you know that's where you
[54:16] that's where the strength is that's
[54:17] where truth is that's where because if
[54:19] you've got truth you've got strength you
[54:22] know you because truth truth always wins
[54:24] out
[54:29] because you stand you stand for him
[54:31] he'll stand for you
[54:36] he says
[54:38] and then we go run
[54:39] he said having on the breastplate of
[54:41] righteousness
[54:42] he said he said that's the word the word
[54:45] of God in you doing what's right
[54:48] covering the heart
[54:49] the the chest
[54:52] being being protected
[54:57] so we know that you know when you have
[54:59] the word
[55:00] he said you know you want to do right
[55:03] and so being protected in your and and
[55:06] the
[55:08] because you know
[55:11] you know God chose the heart but Satan
[55:14] chose the head to have for the
[55:16] battlefield but you know what this is
[55:18] where you where if you know what as as
[55:20] the scripture says as a man thinketh
[55:22] then his heart so is he so if you have
[55:24] that breastplate of righteousness and
[55:26] it's not your righteousness but it's his
[55:28] righteousness if you're protected by him
[55:30] then Satan can come against you but you
[55:33] know what he can't take that out of you
[55:35] he can't get he can't get through that
[55:38] and the scripture goes on he says in the
[55:40] and he says
[55:42] having on the breastplate of
[55:43] righteousness and he says your feet
[55:44] shall with the preparation of the gospel
[55:46] of peace and he says what is it he says
[55:48] go anywhere
[55:50] go anyplace anytime feet shot with the
[55:53] gospel see
[55:56] and the scripture tells us Luke 10 19
[55:59] says behold I give you power to tread on
[56:01] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[56:04] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[56:06] any means hurt you so if you're if you
[56:09] have peace if you've been saved you have
[56:11] protection there then you can walk over
[56:13] all the power of the enemy he said and
[56:15] nothing shall any means hurt you and
[56:17] brother Randall goes on to talk about in
[56:19] Great War and the great warrior Joshua
[56:21] you know he talks about Footprints he
[56:23] said that's possession he said that's
[56:25] what church needs tonight is more
[56:26] footsteps over here on this land he said
[56:29] don't hang around Jordan too long let's
[56:31] get over here and see what we got
[56:35] so that's what it is he said you've got
[56:36] a footstep every time he footprinted on
[56:39] it it was a possession
[56:41] and you know you have to be shod and you
[56:45] know in the Old Testament you know when
[56:47] they got ready to leave Egypt you know
[56:49] they had to eat the Lamb with their feet
[56:52] shot they had to have their shoes and
[56:54] they were ready to go had their staff in
[56:56] their hand why because when they ate
[56:59] that lamb they were out the door
[57:01] why because they were on the move
[57:03] because that was the last thing to do
[57:05] was to after they applied the door to
[57:08] the blood to the door was to eat the
[57:10] word and then they were leaving
[57:12] and that was the last thing that had to
[57:14] be done and that's the same way with us
[57:15] is to be ready to go and you'd not just
[57:18] go anywhere but to make a body change to
[57:21] be able to ready to be able to go out of
[57:23] here and be always ready to leave and do
[57:26] whatever God has us to do but that's the
[57:28] the one thing is to be ready to go
[57:32] to be prepared
[57:35] and brother bam says
[57:39] he says
[57:43] he says and
[57:46] above all taking the shield of Faith
[57:48] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[57:50] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[57:52] brother Branham says he said this great
[57:54] big chilled
[57:56] the size of a Door of Faith
[58:00] that's what I have
[58:02] I said Thank God it was the size of a
[58:04] door
[58:05] that's that's for me
[58:07] somebody I can get behind the door
[58:12] and so he goes on and
[58:16] that Shield of Faith said be able to
[58:18] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[58:21] so if he comes at you whatever however
[58:23] he comes with out comes against you you
[58:26] have that Shield of Faith to protect you
[58:28] and he says take on the helmet of
[58:30] salvation
[58:31] to protect you
[58:33] see that's where the devil fights you in
[58:35] the mind so you've got a helmet to
[58:37] protect you and he said and the sword of
[58:39] the spirit which is the word of God
[58:42] you know all these other ones he goes
[58:44] through and he always talks about you
[58:45] have defense defense defense but now you
[58:49] get to the one where you actually fight
[58:51] you know because he said you're
[58:53] protected you're protected you're
[58:54] protected
[58:56] you know if you realize how if you're if
[58:58] you're protected then you know what you
[59:00] don't mind going at it
[59:02] you're advancing
[59:04] you know if you if you played if you
[59:06] ever played football
[59:08] and you know and you realize that the
[59:10] guys on the line
[59:12] can hold their own
[59:14] then you know what you don't mind
[59:15] throwing the ball you don't mind running
[59:17] the ball
[59:18] but you know what if the guy's on the
[59:20] line can't hold nobody back
[59:23] you know you're all the time running for
[59:24] your life
[59:25] you ain't got no confidence to do
[59:27] anything
[59:30] but you know the thing is if you if you
[59:31] understand that you're protected then
[59:33] you know what you've got your weapon to
[59:35] fight
[59:37] you're protected so you know you can go
[59:39] forth and take care of the things that
[59:41] the devil brings against you
[59:45] brother Brian says and and taking on the
[59:47] whole armor of God he said you know
[59:48] you've got to know your enemy he said
[59:50] you've got to know your armor he said
[59:52] your armor is the word your enemy is
[59:54] something that'll reason against it he
[59:57] said he said the church and the
[59:59] intellectual Giants he said you'll
[1:00:02] listen to him for a few minutes and he
[1:00:04] said he'll have you so far away from the
[1:00:06] truth you won't even know where you're
[1:00:08] at so deceiving
[1:00:11] so he was talking about all these things
[1:00:13] but you know you've got to know your
[1:00:15] enemy and how he's going to attack you
[1:00:17] he said but you've got to know your
[1:00:18] armor he said you've got to know where
[1:00:20] you stand
[1:00:21] and you know that was one of the things
[1:00:23] that we're talking about David you know
[1:00:25] when David went up there and you know
[1:00:27] David knew who he was and David knew
[1:00:30] what his protection was and you know
[1:00:32] when he when he went to Saul you know
[1:00:34] Saul tried to give him armor
[1:00:36] but you know he told Saul he said I
[1:00:39] can't do I can't use this he said
[1:00:40] because I've never proved it he said but
[1:00:43] he said but I know what works why
[1:00:45] because he had his own armor which was
[1:00:47] the word of God which because he stood
[1:00:49] there and told told him said listen
[1:00:51] he said there was a lion that tried to
[1:00:53] come you know the bear tried to come and
[1:00:55] take and take one of mine
[1:00:57] but he said I slew him
[1:00:59] and he said how much more were this
[1:01:01] uncircumcised Philistine he said because
[1:01:04] you know I have my own protection
[1:01:07] because you know he trusted in God he
[1:01:09] didn't have to trust in armor and you
[1:01:11] know here's one that you you would have
[1:01:13] thought that one that was standing there
[1:01:15] the way he did you would think that all
[1:01:17] the rest of them especially Saul who
[1:01:20] were well trained and well armored and
[1:01:22] all these things they would have stood
[1:01:24] there in fought
[1:01:26] but you know what they didn't have their
[1:01:28] trust in the right place
[1:01:31] you know I believe and I always said
[1:01:33] that you know it didn't matter where
[1:01:35] David threw the rock all he had to do
[1:01:38] was have faith in God he could have
[1:01:40] threw it any direction
[1:01:42] and you know what because it didn't
[1:01:44] matter because it wasn't David throwing
[1:01:46] the rock it was God
[1:01:49] it was God and David was standing all
[1:01:51] David had to do we said Lord it's not my
[1:01:54] battle it's your battle
[1:01:58] they stood there and said how can how
[1:01:59] can y'all stand there and let this
[1:02:01] uncircumcised philistine
[1:02:03] stand there and defy the armies of God
[1:02:06] and defy the god of Heaven
[1:02:10] he said he said you know somebody just
[1:02:12] had to be there and be a uh
[1:02:15] representative of God
[1:02:17] to stand there and do the work and God
[1:02:20] took over
[1:02:23] and so
[1:02:24] he was able to slay the Giant Goliath
[1:02:27] didn't have us didn't stand a chance
[1:02:31] but you know a lot of people they they
[1:02:32] look at these are these Giants in the
[1:02:34] land
[1:02:36] and they think oh it's it's too big or
[1:02:37] it's too hard
[1:02:39] no God just wants you to stand there and
[1:02:41] and take him at his word and you know
[1:02:43] what you can overcome
[1:02:48] so you all the way through the scripture
[1:02:51] you know the different ones and
[1:02:55] hey speaking of
[1:02:58] and uh taking on the whole armor of God
[1:03:00] you he was talking about people being
[1:03:02] just fundamental
[1:03:04] he said you know if fundamental
[1:03:06] fundamentalism was right he said you
[1:03:08] know Moab and all the rest of them would
[1:03:10] have been right
[1:03:11] he said you know they would have had it
[1:03:13] all
[1:03:14] but he said he said but they fail to see
[1:03:16] that what the children of Israel had and
[1:03:19] you know we have to see the same thing
[1:03:20] we had to understand what we have he
[1:03:22] said you know Moab and Balaam you know
[1:03:24] they forgot to they failed to see what
[1:03:27] God had done for them you know he said
[1:03:29] he said they had the pillar of fire they
[1:03:31] had a smitten Rock and you know they had
[1:03:33] the the Brazen Serpent and all these
[1:03:35] things that God was in their midst and
[1:03:37] you know he came against them
[1:03:41] and you know as long as as long as they
[1:03:43] stood right where they were supposed to
[1:03:44] be and stayed with the word you know
[1:03:46] Balaam couldn't touch them
[1:03:48] but you know what they walked away from
[1:03:50] their by their own accord
[1:03:52] to call and Balaam was able to to have
[1:03:55] them for God to curse them
[1:03:59] brother said in in the Smyrna Church age
[1:04:01] he said no True Believer is any stronger
[1:04:04] and spiritually healthy and Alive than
[1:04:06] his knowledge of an adherence to the
[1:04:08] pure word of God he said it's seen by
[1:04:10] multitudes of examples in the Old
[1:04:13] Testament
[1:04:15] so we see all the way through the Old
[1:04:17] Testament see it's holding on to this
[1:04:19] word of God that if you hold on to it
[1:04:22] that he'll bring you to
[1:04:24] right brother Brown says
[1:04:27] this is from Lamb's Book of Life he says
[1:04:29] he said he makes no mistakes
[1:04:32] he said he wouldn't bring you in if he
[1:04:34] wasn't worthy he said he knows your
[1:04:36] heart that's right he knows what you are
[1:04:38] he knows your emotives he knows what you
[1:04:40] are he said there's traps all along the
[1:04:42] road sure the devil will cause you to
[1:04:45] stumble when you say God I didn't mean
[1:04:46] to do that
[1:04:47] God you know it he said you're still
[1:04:50] perfect
[1:04:51] because there's a perfect blood offered
[1:04:53] for you every day in a bleeding
[1:04:55] sacrifice handing hanging Before the
[1:04:57] Throne of almighty God
[1:05:01] I'm so glad that we have that
[1:05:03] I may not I may not be perfect in
[1:05:06] anybody's eyes but you know what I have
[1:05:08] a perfect sacrifice
[1:05:11] so you know you can stand there and say
[1:05:13] well I may not may not be what I ought
[1:05:16] to be but I'm not what I used to be I
[1:05:18] have something that protects me
[1:05:22] brother Branham says
[1:05:24] he said you know he talks about he said
[1:05:26] you don't have to pet Christians he said
[1:05:28] Christians are rugged
[1:05:30] he said he said we need he said there
[1:05:32] are men and women of God who stand for
[1:05:34] God regardless of what everybody else
[1:05:36] has to say he said you don't have to beg
[1:05:38] them and persuade them and perfume them
[1:05:40] and baby them around that's a hotbed
[1:05:42] hybrid plant it's no good he said it'll
[1:05:45] never produce anything
[1:05:48] but that's not what God wants
[1:05:50] God wants us to be rugged individuals
[1:05:54] he said brother man says and forsaking
[1:05:57] all he said you can expect the world to
[1:05:59] make fun of you
[1:06:02] they're going to make fun of you
[1:06:05] but you know what
[1:06:06] he made they made fun of him
[1:06:10] if they made fun of him they're going to
[1:06:11] make fun of you
[1:06:14] but you know what we have an armor we
[1:06:16] have something that'll Hold Us
[1:06:18] through all things
[1:06:23] to make us who we are make us what we
[1:06:25] ought to be
[1:06:27] brother Branham says
[1:06:29] I don't like I don't like to have this
[1:06:31] one but this is
[1:06:34] this is from identification 1963 said
[1:06:36] we've got to take the entire Full Gospel
[1:06:39] he said we must now being that we have
[1:06:42] been identified ourselves as Full Gospel
[1:06:44] people he said let's mold our character
[1:06:48] he said I love this he said we're
[1:06:49] invited to be molded into his image that
[1:06:52] we might reflect his presence and the
[1:06:55] works that I do shall you do also the
[1:06:58] life that I live
[1:06:59] so shall you he said we're invited by
[1:07:02] God to take him as an example and let
[1:07:04] our character be molded like he is
[1:07:07] he said then we let then when we let his
[1:07:10] character be in us then we have become
[1:07:12] Sons
[1:07:13] but having the mind of Christ mind which
[1:07:16] is his character your mind takes takes
[1:07:19] your character
[1:07:21] oh they find it praise the Lord
[1:07:25] your mind takes you let the Mind Paul
[1:07:27] said of Christ this mind being you let's
[1:07:29] let that mind of Christ be in you and it
[1:07:32] molds the character of a son of God
[1:07:37] so we're invited to be molded into his
[1:07:40] image
[1:07:41] I mean we can
[1:07:45] as the scripture tells us you know you
[1:07:47] can you can take this
[1:07:49] because it's been given to you
[1:07:52] but you know what if you don't take it
[1:07:54] it's not his fault
[1:07:55] he's offered it to you but I love that
[1:07:58] he's been he's he's invited us you have
[1:08:01] an invitation
[1:08:03] to be molded Into His Image we haven't
[1:08:06] we have this invitation
[1:08:08] and you know it's so it's so amazing
[1:08:10] that when you see what you have
[1:08:12] it gives you courage it gives you
[1:08:14] boldness
[1:08:16] he gives you it makes you makes you be
[1:08:18] appreciative of what you have
[1:08:22] and you know
[1:08:23] then you want to share it with somebody
[1:08:28] because I want the world to know
[1:08:33] and the world don't want to know
[1:08:35] the world don't care but
[1:08:37] I want to be a be a witness
[1:08:41] so let's stay in this
[1:08:42] musicians coming
[1:08:45] I want to be a witness to the world of
[1:08:47] what he's done for me
[1:08:48] I want to put on this whole armor
[1:08:51] and stand
[1:08:52] in this wicked and
[1:08:55] adulterous generation I want to be a
[1:08:58] witness of what God has done
[1:09:02] and I want to be there
[1:09:08] the world may
[1:09:10] may fall apart in the world
[1:09:12] goes whichever way
[1:09:15] but you know what I'm so thankful that I
[1:09:17] have something that'll hold me that I
[1:09:19] can that I can hold on to right you know
[1:09:21] brother Brown said you know he said when
[1:09:23] when your wife died and your child died
[1:09:25] he said he said did you hold on to your
[1:09:29] religion he said no it held on to me
[1:09:31] that's what I want I want something
[1:09:34] that'll hold on to me and that's what I
[1:09:35] believe that I have that I have this so
[1:09:38] we can put this home
[1:09:40] that we that we can be fully equipped
[1:09:42] and armored
[1:09:46] because you know brother random said
[1:09:47] what what is this the armor of God Amen
[1:09:50] he said you know it's supernatural he
[1:09:52] said what is the armor he said it's love
[1:09:55] it's Joy it's peace long suffering
[1:10:00] gentleness meekness say all these things
[1:10:04] and you know what you say well I don't
[1:10:06] have that
[1:10:07] you know what
[1:10:09] you can
[1:10:14] because you know you say well I have if
[1:10:16] you have the Holy Ghost you do right
[1:10:18] right you may not make it may not be
[1:10:20] made manifest all the time but you know
[1:10:23] what he'll give you the opportunity to
[1:10:25] make that make that manifest
[1:10:28] just like just like man was talking
[1:10:29] about you know he said
[1:10:32] he said you know wanting wanting
[1:10:34] patience and and love and understanding
[1:10:39] and he said you know I just want I just
[1:10:41] want to be more understanding and more
[1:10:42] thoughtful and and more loving and more
[1:10:44] caring and more patient and all these
[1:10:46] things like that and he said he said you
[1:10:49] don't understand how the world how the
[1:10:50] Lord Works he said that he gave me an
[1:10:53] ADH child
[1:10:59] so we don't we don't and then you I know
[1:11:01] I know it's supposed to be a little joke
[1:11:02] but they'll get it maybe tomorrow
[1:11:06] but you know I don't think either one of
[1:11:09] mine are that way but you know I think
[1:11:10] that's why I am
[1:11:14] you you think
[1:11:16] say Lord
[1:11:18] was I ever that bad
[1:11:23] I'm sure my parents are going
[1:11:27] they might be saying you were worse
[1:11:30] like they say you have to pay for your
[1:11:31] raisin
[1:11:34] but you know
[1:11:37] when you become a when you become a
[1:11:38] parent
[1:11:39] you can see the love of God right
[1:11:45] right because you know you see what God
[1:11:48] what God has done for you and you see
[1:11:50] the the goodness of God in your life
[1:11:52] what God has done for you and you and
[1:11:54] you see that you don't you don't
[1:11:56] understand a lot of those things until
[1:11:57] you become a parent and you don't
[1:12:00] understand what your parents have been
[1:12:01] through
[1:12:04] right sometimes you think they've lost
[1:12:05] their mind
[1:12:08] and then all of a sudden you realize
[1:12:09] well you caused that
[1:12:12] it's all your fault
[1:12:16] right but I thank God that we have a
[1:12:17] heavenly father that understands and he
[1:12:20] knows
[1:12:21] all our needs
[1:12:24] all the things that we've had to go

[1:19:50] well
[1:19:53] I don't know what number it is it's when
[1:19:55] I reached that City on the hill
[1:19:58] I don't know what number that is
[1:20:01] I know it's the key of G
[1:20:05] has anybody reached it do what
[1:20:08] 26.
[1:20:09] amen Amen on top of Mount Zions
[1:20:31] oh my cities

[1:21:29] that City
[1:21:38] never leave me alone
[1:22:04] living
[1:22:05] through the air
[1:22:07] the ages when I reap that City on the
[1:22:11] hill so I'll stay here until my savior
[1:22:16] comes amen trying daily to perform his
[1:22:21] will
[1:22:23] he'll say unto me
[1:22:40] and I love
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:47] just went
[1:22:49] into that City over here
[1:22:56] oh amen
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:00] it used to be a song
[1:23:02] some folks used to sing said I already
[1:23:04] like it I'm not even there
[1:23:07] amen that's what I like
[1:23:09] I already love it
[1:23:11] not ever seen it
[1:23:13] and I've seen it by the eyes of faith
[1:23:17] and that's where we're headed
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] just a short time here and then we're
[1:23:22] out
[1:23:24] I don't believe it'll be long
[1:23:28] but you know it's us
[1:23:32] he said only brother I said only thing
[1:23:34] he saw holding off the Rapture was the
[1:23:36] Readiness of the Bride
[1:23:38] and Lord just help us get ready
[1:23:41] Lord modus into your image
[1:23:44] Lord make us ready that we can get out
[1:23:46] of here
[1:23:48] because you know
[1:23:49] you know he said
[1:23:51] were those in Egypt he said when they
[1:23:54] when they cried for a deliverer
[1:23:56] he said God sent one
[1:23:58] you know when the bride gets ready
[1:24:02] and I believe that's what's happening
[1:24:04] right now that's right
[1:24:07] as
[1:24:08] as brother Daniel was preaching about
[1:24:10] Godly desperation
[1:24:13] you get desperate
[1:24:15] when nothing else matters
[1:24:19] and that's what we're looking for Lord
[1:24:20] just get us out of here
[1:24:23] amen the Lord bless you this evening
[1:24:26] yes
[1:24:28] brother way
[1:24:30] we got a text a few minutes a little
[1:24:32] while ago Mr Monica I don't know if any
[1:24:35] of you know it or not but she the doctor
[1:24:37] says she has the worst case at poison
[1:24:39] ivy
[1:24:40] or something she's ever seen they put
[1:24:43] her on steroids and she's doing better
[1:24:44] that's why they're not here tonight so
[1:24:46] they're not sure it's poison ivy but
[1:24:48] that's the closest thing the doctor
[1:24:49] could think of so we need to just keep
[1:24:51] her in prayer because Bob said he was
[1:24:54] said he makes him itch just to look at
[1:24:55] her so we know that we know that uh that
[1:24:59] sister Monica is a precious sister and
[1:25:01] she needs our prayer so thank God that
[1:25:04] we do have
[1:25:06] a God that can reach out and touch
[1:25:07] somebody so brother before you go pray
[1:25:10] away pray for him yes sir Bill's been
[1:25:13] right down that road
[1:25:15] stand there tonight
[1:25:19] well we need to enter in I know they're
[1:25:20] watching so I wanted to mention her name
