Honduras you have a home there a church to go to as [Applause] well because we're part of the same family amen God bless you and let's go to the scriptures we're not going to we're not going to keep you all too long this evening Let's us go to the Book of Matthew I see happy faces when I say I'm we're going to get out early [Laughter] tonight Matthew 2626 the book and then we're going to go to another scripture in Hebrews do you have Matthew 2626 and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins verse 29 but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom in the book of Hebrews chapter 9 verse1 [Music] 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hissop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission let us bow our heads to pray loving Heavenly Father Lord the people here have come not to waste their time lord they've come to be edified Lord I pray that you just set me aside that you forgive us our sins and our mistakes help us to be of a blessing to your people Lord is is the is the ones that you love the most they are what you love the most Lord they are the purchase of your blood there on Calvary lord they're before me this evening and I want to treat them like like your children Lord and so Lord let it be your holy spirit that guides Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I think one day we'll finish this journey and we'll get to that place that we've we've been waiting for we've get we'll get to that place that we've desired and we'll we'll we'll come to our goal we'll get there and we'll see our loved ones and we'll see the Lord we will see him and I believe that we'll get there and I think one of the things that we'll know when we get there that if we're in that place amen it's because of his grace all things work by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ everything we have is because of his grace we are in this place because of his grace we believed his word and it's because of his grace we are in this message because of his grace by his Divine election David said the cords have fallen upon me in in in in lovely [Music] places and I've heard preachers say that those cords are are whips [Music] but I don't believe that there are whips that are there trying to hurt you you can't say that something that whips you uh is something that's nice or that feels good you know that some the cords has to be something different that when David said that the cords have fallen in in in lovely places it he was not refering to as as whips hitting his back because that would not be nice or feel good for that would not feel good at all nobody can say that they feel good when a whip is hitting them hitting them you know but even uh with all of that David could say that that the cords have fallen to me on in lovely places and when you look at the story in the Old Testament you can see that when a father had an inheritance and he had lands to give to his children children when he was going to give out those lands he would join he would get gather together his children and he would tell his sons that that all the lands that belonged to him show them all his sons had a part of the inheritance all his sons had a part of that inheritance that belonged to them because that father was giving it to them and we also have a father and so this evening we'll leave the deeper things here for the ministers we're going to preach something that's simple but that it edify every one of you so I hope that you pay attention to the word and that you can see what God has given us this evening so the father would look at that land and he would take his first son and we tell him L I want us to pray because I'm getting ready to let the cords go and wherever the courts fall that's where your inheritance will be they would gather together and they would pray and the father would take those cords and he would let those cords go and wherever those cords would fall that was where the inheritance of the older one named Luis would be then he would call another the other one maybe the next one whose name is Aaron and then maybe the next son Nam named Bob he would he would also throw the cords and sometimes those cords would fall in places where you could plant easily in that area and sometimes those cords would fall in areas where it was fle but sometimes those cords would fall in areas where it was really M and that was The Inheritance that each one of those children have sometimes the cords would fall in sterile land that was the land that would belong to that son so when David looked at that example he went there even beyond the the the uh uh the found before the foundation of the world and he could see that the cords were also thrown there for him because our lives are under [Music] predestination everything that was going to happen in our lives God already knows about that's why God is not worried about your problems because before the problem comes God knows how it's going to end up that's why God is not worried about the squeezes that we get in sometimes because before that squeeze comes on knows that he has the solution for each one of those things that's part of having the mind of God the mind of God gives you faith in his word you know whatever comes all that is in God's perfect hands he has everything under his control it doesn't matter what comes everything is in his hands and when David looked at that example David could see that the cords of his [Music] inheritance did not fall in muddy [Music] places did not fall in infertile lands but fell in good land and I want you to look at that tonight that your cords the cords of your life the cords of your predestination did not fall in Baptist territory did not fall in pental territory did not fall here in Le but they fell in good places you believing the word tonight because the cords have fallen in good places everything works under that predestin now there's a thin line there it's not that God says I like him and that one I don't like this one's very good looking I'm G to save him but this one right here he's ugly I'm going to condemn him that's not how it works it's not that God started looking to see and say and say I'm going to save him because he's good I'm not gonna save this one because I just don't like him that's a mistake to believe predestination that way predestination is not even based on the love of God God can love a person very much God can love you very much but the love of God cannot do anything for you if you don't want it amen amen God loved the the Rich Young Ruler he came and bowed before [Music] Jesus he said Lord what can I do to inherit eternal life what can I do to inherit eternal life and he told him do you know the Commandments you will not steal he said I don't steal that I I can check that make check that you don't lie he said I don't lie I can check that you check your lives it says honor your father and your mother I don't know if every young person here could check that Amen brother when your mom comes and says come out get out of your room it's time to eat I'm not hungry I already told you let's go to church I don't want to go to church stop getting in my life I want to live my life honor your mom and dad so that you'd have Length of days in your life that was a young man he say that he honored his mom and dad he said he said I fulfill the law and the Lord loved him and the Lord went in in his heart he told him there's only one thing that you must do is go sell everything and and give it to the poor and come follow me just one little thing sometimes we have more than one thing but one thing it it was it it got in the way of that of that boy and let's continue here Jesus loved that Rich Young Ruler but he could not save him because the love of God has nothing to do with predestination I'm just gonna I'm telling you what brother brandham said brother Bram said that when God predestinated he didn't do it according to your will because his will is for no one to be lost and so when he predestinated he did it according to his previous his for knowledge he did it according to his pres presen uh pre knowledge a pre- knowledge okay for [Applause] knowledge he did it according to his for knowledge and that's the way he did it before the story started God knew how the story would end before you were born he knew what you would become he knew that you would accept him according to your decision God put his name in the Lamb's Book of Life isn't that glorious when a when a child is born they take him to register his name or or get a birth certificate and they give him a name they gave him Eric G and they gave him L Fernando and they gave her Christine isn't it glorious to know that before our parents put us on on a certificate God already put us in an eternal book Let Me Tell those names are before God the whole time you can't be lost in any way if your name is in that Lamb's Book of Life do you believe amen hallelujah hallelujah and that's where our names are and all of that is by his grace now what we're going to talk about tonight the two scriptures that we read here are speaking about a new [Applause] [Music] Testament a new testament or a New Covenant that's being made by the Lord Jesus Christ because before before that there was a previous Testament a test that was put there by the law Testament that was placed there that to let us know that we could not save ourselves they had priests and the those priests had Privileges and you know a priest is one that stands before God and the [Music] people a priest is someone that officiate sacrifices the people could have access to God's mercy and there are many priests in the Bible one of them was Aaron and we could mention others but uh it gets my attention that one of the first offices or that the Lord had our Lord had is to be a priest because before Aaron there was priests Even Adam when he had fallen he needed someone to stand for him Abraham after the battle he met him with with with a priest that priest name was mzc and it's the same priest that we have today there's been a debate to know who M social media they they'll debate about who was MZ they ask who is mzed they don't know who MC is MC uh came before Abraham he came before Abraham he presented himself before Abraham's seed and the prophet of God here in this last age has told us who that MC ISC has a namec is our Lord Jesus Christ the sacrifice that we were waiting for so we have had a priest in in throughout the Bible they had great privileges they could go into the the to the temple they could go in not just to the holy Place holies of holies and they would go Beyond the Veil all the people were left outside they could go inside the presence of God where the Ark of the Covenant was at and they could open up the ark and take the Mana that was there and could eat it they could see that Holy Light that was coming down from the sh Glory of but yet the people outside could not go inside and brother that is in in that holy of holies is where the life was dwelling at it wasn't in the exterior court and it wasn't in the Holy place but the M the life of God was in the holies of holies and the high priests could go in there could taste of that life there was so much life [Music] there the the the the priest he went in with a rod to to he was TR he was he went in uh uh trying to uh walk with a with a dry rod on a dry [Music] rod and it it was a crooked old dry Rod a life that it didn't have any life a rod that didn't want to go to church anymore that didn't even sing anymore at church a that didn't even like the fellowship at church a rod that had uh was always mad at people that Rod had enemies I'm not speaking of any anybody here I'm talking about that Rod it was dry it was crooked one day that priest he left it there and he could only go in one time a year he left that holies of holies and he left that rod in there and when he remembered he said the the the the rod and he he wanted maybe to go back but now he he couldn't he had to wait till the following year and the following year you know what happened the prophet said that when he went in there again he was looking for the rod looking to see where that Rod was at and may he couldn't find it the only thing that he was looking at was was was something that had flowered and they had leaves green leaves and they also had fruit on it what had happened that dry Rod that crooked Rod that that had no and had brought life once again now let me tell you tonight if if that Rod that had no life what came came to life and could live once again there is life for you also glory to God but there was something only the high priest could go in there glory to God because in this time the Bible tells us that he has made us God has made us Kings and Priests not only Kings but also priests priests tonight draw closer to that holy of holies because there's Mana in that Ark life in his presence do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah glory to God now when we're we're speaking of a a testament or or a covenant there is's something that happens that that that that that causes the story to to come through and that that is what happened with Adam uh a covenant means to to attach something it means to make something obligatory uh make something obligatory or or or come to an agreement between two people right and the prophet said that there's many ways to make a covenant it told us that in Japan they would throw salt behind them their back when we have a wedding that is a covenant that's being made a covenant that cannot be broken and we don't throw salt in Mexico they throw rice at each other and everything but what we use is the is the the ring is the ring two points for brother Eric it's Wednesday night I can't think is [Laughter] Fast Love the Lord amen GL to God and here we use a ring who has a wedding band excellent excellent I don't have mine with me right now I lost it actually in a wedding glory to God and so that that that ring represents that there that's a sign that there's a [Music] covenant and there's different ways to do that or or to make that Covenant happen the first Covenant that God made with man he made it with Adam he made it it between him and and and god um but every time God makes a covenant with man God always keeps his Covenant the prophet tells us that man always break their covenants God he created all things he made Natural Life he made the plants the minerals the animals from the biggest one to the smallest one and then he made man and he made them he made him in his image and he gave adam he gave adam a covenant they made a covenant between them themselves Adam he had good health under that Covenant of God Adam had control over the elements Adam had eternal life Adam could not get SI while he was under that Covenant with God under that Covenant man and woman were co-equal until the serpent came and started speaking to Eve and Eve stopped to listen now remember what the Lord said he said from all the trees you can eat but not from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and the serpent came and told her Eve you've seen all the trees and you can eat from all of them but Eve told the serpent but the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil God said that we should we not eat of it not even touch it and God had not said for them not to touch it and I what I want to say is this that the church always wants to do more a little more than what God had said God had told her that they would not eat of it but she said that they would not eat of it neither should they touch it and sometimes we we try to add more we try to add our part when there's nothing else that we can add to this God already did everything that he needed to do you can't do nothing to be saved you can't you can't say that I come to church enough to be saved sisters you can't say I wear the longest skirt in church and I know I'm saved you can't say I don't cut my hair because I want to be saved you can't save your own self you can't do you can't Merit salvation by works you can't add nothing to it in order to be saved everything that was required for salvation did it for us on the cross of Calvary paid it on the cross of Calvary now you dress properly not so that you can be saved not so that you can be saved but because God has already done a work in you glory to God hallelujah hallelujah of all the trees you you can eat and you know what happened Eve was deceived and she ate of that tree and she fell and Adam in order to save her he had to fall as well so here was God and he was looking for Adam and you know why because God had fellowship with Adam but sin had separated them and there was God the voice of God telling calling out Adam Adam where art thou that evening that Adam did not come to the fellowship that evening Adam did not have fellowship with God so the voice of God went through the garden of looking for his son so that he can have fellowship with him once again God loves Fellowship that's why we come to this place not to just have fellowship with each other fellowship with God the voice of God was going through that Garden saying Adam Where Art Thou and Adam was hiding amen amen let me ask you why was God asking where Adam was did God know where he was he knew exactly where he was he knew where he was hidden he did he know what Adam had done did God know what Adam had done yes God knew what what he had did did God know that Adam was naked of course he knew that he was naked there's nothing that you and I can do that God does not know about yet God was asking Adam Adam Where Art Thou not because he did not know because in the inner part of God there was an attribute called mercy God was trying to look for Adam not to condemn Adam mercy God was waiting for Adam to recognize at so that he could fix things with Adam sometimes we walk in this life with problems in our hearts we tell our sister we tell our brother about them we even tell people that don't even believe unbelievers but we never talk to God about those problems we never get down to our knees and talk to him about it he's waiting that you and I speak to him about it he's waiting that you and I go to him about those things there's nothing that you and I have done that he does not know about that's right am amen can you allow me to say something what we do by ourselves God knows about too what we listen to God knows what we do what we do in our rooms God knows what he what we're doing I hope you don't get upset with me if not I'm leaving tomorrow [Laughter] so that by the time I come back again you forgot about it but God knows everything and I'm very happy about that because even though with all of that he still loves us I was telling uh the church there brother Stan that there's young girls or young men uh they'll take uh um um what's the name Daisy sorry okay and they'll take the the the the Petals of the Daisy and they'll say they they're thinking of the person that they love they think of their love life and they'll they love me or he loves me he loves me not he loves me and they start laughing no oh he doesn't love me he loves me no he doesn't love me until he gets to she gets to the last pedal and they realize they they if he or she if he loves he or he loves her or not did you ever do that yourself you did it sister and it looks like he did love [Laughter] you I wonder if any brother here has ever done that now we we can do that with people that we love but we couldn't do that with God because if we do that with God we could take that that that um that [Music] Daisy say we could take that Daisy we could say he loves me we take the next pedal you would think about God and You' say he loves me take the next pedal he'd say he loves me the next pedal would be you think of his Mercy you say he loves me he loves me He Loves Me He Loves Me He Loves Me He Loves Me that's what God is that's god with his bride there is no place where he does not love his bride that's why he gave his life for his for his bride and we we can see Adam here he's hiding himself hiding himself from God's mercy and here comes God and finds him and when he finds him he finds finds him with fig tree fig leaves around him those fig leaves really did not cover Adam well they were trying to cover his nakedness but it was not enough the prophet told us what those fig leaves represent that it represents a cover it represents religion the the problem was not the actual cover the problem was with not with the Fig leaves but listen the problem was that there was no blood involved let me I'll tell you tonight every religion every covering that does not have blood in her will not work in your life you might say I believe the message but if the blood is not there all it is is religion you say I believe the prophet but if the blood is not there all it is is just religion in your life and I'll tell you tonight the blood is the life of the lamb and so that this message be effective has to have the Life of Christ in you glory to God without it it will not work that was Adam's problem that there was no blood involved the problem with Cain's sacrifice that there was no blood involved the blood has always worked its purpose hallelujah hallelujah and he came down and he had his judgment the time glory to God have patience with me tonight I'm going to take the minutes that I didn't take last [Laughter] Services we're almost finished get happy because we're almost finished so there was Adam there and you know what happened God he cursed the the land 6,000 years went by and everything went uh to put everything in order to put everything in order and then afterwards he looked at his son and he preferred to uh to curse the land instead of cursing his [Music] son said the land would produce uh uh thorns and thistles see amen going to produce things that were not part of God's perfect will he play he punished the woman and that with with pain she would give birth to children now is that true sisters see and that's what God did and then after that he put them out of the garden know he put He he gave them the the the the Skins uh the that they dressed with Lin they were walking out of the Garden of [Music] Eden now Adam was carrying the burden of his sin Eve was carrying her own responsibility and as they as they were walking out of the garden and the prophet says in the message job the servant of God when Adam was walking out with his wife under condemnation it was a shadow a sh there was a shadow R of of R Redemption somewhere because there was blood that was still dripping upon them that was a shadow of redemption and brand says I can hear the sound of those skins flapping on their skin flapping upon Adam's legs and with that sound they were speaking of another time what was that it was a shadow that the genuine Redemption would come later on that true Redemption would come a a man named J who was a prophet of God he could see that Redemption draw near the Redemption that was promised to Adam and when we make a mistake we can do something to but when it deals with sin there's nothing that we can do to fix that we need God to do that for us so when that Redemption was drawing J could see that J needed in his condition healing because he was sick ation needed someone to believe him needed a Healer needed a provider because he had lost everything needed a Healer because he had lost his [Music] healing needed many things J needed a provider a Healer need a pastor or Shepherd to help guide him glory to God job needed all those things hallelujah hallelujah job was needing each one of those things would manifest in his and he was laying on he was sick poor without friends with no one to Pastor him or Shepherd him with no one to to be his Justice and when he was in that condition someone stood before him and and recognized and when job looked at him he could not help to say that I know my redeemer liveth everything that he needed was in a redeemer glory to God hallelujah [Music] hallelujah and do you know what a redeemer has has seven compound names he is our Justice he is our healer he is our Shepherd he is our our healer he is our provider all those names fall under one name Lord Jesus Christ when when looked at him I know my redeemer liveth what Redemption has has to do everything that you need is in that Redemption [Music] Hallelujah let me look for something here real quick I don't know if I if I stor it or not a redeemer is a provider a redeemer is a Healer is our standard is our peace is Our Shepherd is our Justice and is the one that's always present all of that job needed and when he needed it what did he look at he saw Redemption a redeemer and a redeemer is is uh all these things all these compound names belong to him they're are they're they're part of him and so if you have him and if you need peace take peace from him because he's your redemptor your your Redeemer and he belongs to you we belong to him amen glory to God there's a demon that's called anxiety and I know that [Music] demon and he he's a very good friend of another demon it's called depression they're good friends and when you except anxiety anxiety doesn't come by itself he invites his depression friend to come and and bother you and they're and they're demons that that bother you I remember that those demons would bother me and they would come to me they would make me feel very bad very heavy and burdened until the PE people would tell me there's many problems in your in the church there's many problems that are happening you're going to have to go to the psychologist and I couldn't I couldn't stand it so one day I went to the hospital and there was a psychologist doctor lady there and when I got there and I was getting ready to walk in something stopped me and I and I just asked her how much does it cost to have an appointment a thousand lmas and I went back I sat down on a seat and I said Lord you're not going to allow that I open up my heart with someone that doesn't not even believe your word if someone does that that's fine and I'm not preaching that you can go you can't go see psychologists you can do it if that's how you feel led to but you can also help your faith now uh I sat there in that seat and I said Lord you you won't allow that I tell everything that happens in my life to that person that does not even believe in you so I stood up and I left and it that was on a Saturday and then Sunday I went to work I'm sorry when Monday came and I went to work the situation got worse the burden on my my head the the burden that I had on my back the pain that I had on my the headache that I had and the symptoms of anxiety that I had started to bother me once again so I sat there at my desk at work and I just bowed my head I just prayed to the Lord and I said Satan I know that it's you I know that it's you bothering me but it doesn't matter what you do I have made my choice that I will wait right here and I will wait on the Lord and no matter what you do I will wait on the Lord and everything disappeared let just lifted until today it all just lifted the burden that I had upon me just lift it away the the the burdens that I had that's the burdens that that sometimes we live but with there's so many things surrounding us but don't forget one thing job looked that red Redemption was drawing n and and us we have be been become beneficiaries of the Redemption that has been given to us there on the cross of Calvary and Redemption it includes everything that those seven compound names really what they mean

to make us asham her walking 80 something years old walking with a supposedly broke hip ever how long it took her to get how long does it take her to get to U I mean really it's only like a 20 minute walk but it's it's it's not easy oh 20 well yeah 20 minutes and in that kind of terrain is is pretty rough but she gets to church and we came to it and we got heated seeds so anyway that lady will be there for a witness right God puts people in places for Witnesses sir believe that and when you say I can't do that he'll say she did he did that's right they made the sacrifice they that's what we're going to have to give an account for we're not going to have to give an account for eternal life if we're bride but you going to have given an account when you couldn't get couldn't get to church because your toenail was too long or something you know some frivolous something that that lady had a broke hip 80 something years old and walked right on in and did you see her though she wasn't walking now like a 20-year old she was still struggling but she struggled she was still doing it she was still walking she improvised with the with the little sticks but you know what she headed to church and she had to turn around and come back that that that's the same sister that I talked about that's right yes D at the miracle was you showed the picture of you the sister and uh we sure
