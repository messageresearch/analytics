[29:09] you'll just help us tonight Lord that
[29:10] you'll open up your word to us be with
[29:13] my lips Lord that I'll speak truth in
[29:15] your name amen thank so 1 Chronicles 13
[29:19] we're just going to read the whole
[29:20] chapter um and it's it's a a nice little
[29:24] story here so um even though it's
[29:26] lengthy I think we'll get to it uh in no
[29:29] time so verse one it says and David
[29:31] consulted with the captains of thousands
[29:33] and hundreds and with every
[29:36] leader and David said unto all the
[29:38] congregation of Israel if it seemed good
[29:40] unto you and that it be of the Lord Our
[29:42] God let us send abroad unto our Brethren
[29:44] everywhere that are left in all the land
[29:46] of Israel and with them also to the
[29:48] priests and Levites which were in their
[29:49] cities and suburbs that they may gather
[29:51] themselves unto us and let us bring
[29:54] again the Ark of our God to us for we
[29:56] inquire not at it in the days of Saul
[30:00] and all the congregation said that they
[30:02] would do so for the thing was right in
[30:05] the eyes of all the peop amen so David
[30:07] gathered all Israel together from sheor
[30:10] of Egypt even unto the entering of HTH
[30:13] to bring the Ark of God from Kur jiram
[30:16] boy that's a tongue twister and David
[30:19] went up and all Israel to baa that is to
[30:22] Kurth jiram which belonged to Judah to
[30:25] bring up then the Ark of God the Lord
[30:28] and that dwelleth between the cherubims
[30:31] whose name is called on it and boy
[30:34] there's some good stuff to pull out of
[30:36] here in there and they carried the Ark
[30:38] of God and a new cart out of the house
[30:40] of abinadab and usza and a heo drave the
[30:45] C and David and all Israel played before
[30:48] God with all their might and with
[30:51] singing and with Harps and with
[30:54] suies and with timbral and with
[30:58] symbols and with
[31:01] trumpets and when they came under the
[31:03] threshing floor of shedon oza put forth
[31:06] his hand to hold the ark for The Oxen
[31:09] stumbled and the anger of the Lord was
[31:11] kindled against oza and he smote him
[31:13] because he put his hand to the ark and
[31:15] there he died before God and David was
[31:18] displeased because the Lord had made a
[31:20] breach upon usza wherefore that place is
[31:22] called per peroza to this day and David
[31:27] was was afraid of God that day saying
[31:28] how shall I bring the Ark of God home to
[31:30] me so David brought not the ark home to
[31:33] himself to the city of David but carried
[31:36] it aside into the house of obededom the
[31:39] GTI and the Ark of God remained with the
[31:42] family of obededom in his house three
[31:44] months and the Lord blessed the house of
[31:46] obededom and all that he had you may be
[31:49] seated the Lord blessing bless the
[31:51] reading of his
[31:54] word now you lay out that uh if you
[31:57] really lay out the summation of all that
[31:59] story you can see that David uh started
[32:01] off with a good a what looked like a
[32:03] really good idea that he wanted to
[32:05] restore uh the the Ark of of God he
[32:09] wanted to restore bring it into the
[32:10] where the children of Israel were and
[32:12] and he went forth with all of the the
[32:14] Sues and the timal and the symbols and
[32:16] everything but then at the end of that
[32:18] story somebody died so something was off
[32:22] somewhere and you see you look at this
[32:24] story and you can kind of picture that
[32:26] uh d going forth thinking that uh oh oh
[32:30] I I I I got something I've got an
[32:32] understanding of God I'm I'm going forth
[32:34] and I'm I I I know what I'm supposed to
[32:36] be doing I we're here we go with the ark
[32:38] but something was out of place somewhere
[32:41] now if you would just want to maybe
[32:42] think think about ourselves this morning
[32:44] it's it's really human nature just as a
[32:46] result of the Fall just a result of the
[32:48] the predicament that we're in to ignore
[32:51] like like David was doing there's
[32:52] something wrong but it's our it's our
[32:54] nature to ignore our predicament y to
[32:57] ignore our faults to ignore our
[33:00] situation a lot of times oh that's why
[33:02] we need that's why we got to come to
[33:03] church that's why we have the Bible to
[33:05] expose these little issues and things in
[33:07] our lives that we're we're just because
[33:09] of how we are that we just Overlook we
[33:13] fail to see our our own mistakes we fail
[33:15] to see the way that we are we fail to
[33:17] see a lot of times where we messed up
[33:20] and and you know you come to church and
[33:22] you hear the preaching of the word or
[33:23] you you look into the Bible and you're
[33:25] sitting there meditating on things and
[33:26] it'll exposes our flaws that without
[33:29] that there would be no way for you to be
[33:31] able to see the real picture of who you
[33:34] are I thank God for the revealing of his
[33:36] word I thank God for his word that we
[33:38] can hold that word up to ourselves and
[33:41] see a reflection back are you a
[33:43] reflection of Christ or are you a
[33:45] reflection getting there almost are you
[33:48] you can hold it up to yourself and you
[33:50] can see your mistakes and your failures
[33:53] or you can see where where it's starting
[33:55] to look like a masterpiece yeah and what
[33:57] I'm talking about is I I was I was
[33:59] telling brother Wade I I had to ride
[34:01] down to Atlanta today just to kind of go
[34:03] into work and and see everybody they had
[34:05] a little holiday thing and I was sitting
[34:07] there in traffic and I started thinking
[34:09] uh now now the cars have blind spot
[34:11] detectors they got a little light but
[34:13] back in the day back before we had all
[34:15] this technology we didn't have a little
[34:17] light that would light up you had to be
[34:19] real careful when you merged over into
[34:21] the other lane look in your mirrors and
[34:22] everything is because there's a blind
[34:24] spot a blind spot where you could have a
[34:26] problem if you weren't aware of it and
[34:29] what a blind spot is it's an area you
[34:31] cannot an area where we cannot see or we
[34:34] choose not to see that thing and I I was
[34:38] I think you know as we're looking at
[34:39] this picture of David coming with this
[34:42] with the ark transported the wrong way
[34:45] and all all the all the doings and all
[34:47] the things around it and he had a big
[34:49] old blind spot that he couldn't see that
[34:52] something was not right something wasn't
[34:55] right and so that's why maybe tonight we
[34:58] can look and examine our own selves to
[35:00] see if maybe we have a blind spot
[35:02] something something that just didn't
[35:05] something that we're not doing right now
[35:07] blind spot is our aspects it's an aspect
[35:09] of your personality or behavior or
[35:11] thinking pattern that's it's real
[35:13] obvious blind spots are obvious to
[35:15] others everybody on the road can see if
[35:17] there's a car in your blind spot
[35:19] everybody else can see it but not you
[35:23] not you now isn't that funny how blind
[35:25] spots work a lot of times that everybody
[35:27] else maybe they can point out your blind
[35:29] spot oh You' got a problem with this or
[35:30] whatever but you just won't realize it a
[35:33] lot of times until something happens God
[35:35] will shake you like he shook David
[35:37] sometimes you'll shake a young person
[35:39] and make them realize well all those
[35:41] things that my mom and daddy told me
[35:42] about it turned out to really be true I
[35:45] I do need a little bit of an education I
[35:47] do need uh a good job I do need to be
[35:49] able to position well so that when I get
[35:51] married I can provide for my family all
[35:53] these things that they tried to prepare
[35:55] me and then you get out in real life and
[35:57] then you get shooken shaken a little bit
[36:00] and it's a blind spot now why do we have
[36:02] blind spot I wish we didn't have blind
[36:04] spots but it's just human nature I got
[36:06] blind spots I I today I was I was I'm
[36:09] just telling myself a little bit I was
[36:11] uh we had a meeting at work and somebody
[36:12] was saying uh well what did you invite
[36:16] so and so that was was very important to
[36:18] a project and I was sure that I had
[36:21] invited that person to that meeting but
[36:23] turned out I had forgotten to invite and
[36:26] that's just a little a little trifling
[36:28] example but there's all sorts of things
[36:30] that like that through life that we just
[36:32] we're blind to oh but then you open up
[36:34] the pages of God's word and it reveals
[36:37] something that's lacking in our lives I
[36:39] want to think now now we're not talking
[36:41] about little trifling things tonight
[36:42] though we're talking about the word of
[36:44] God we're talking about and if there's a
[36:46] blind spot in the word God can sure see
[36:48] it in our lives and that's why he wants
[36:51] us to get in the word and just lay in
[36:53] the word lay in it so it'll just have an
[36:55] influence in our lives and it will
[36:57] expose these little these little problem
[36:59] areas the little foxes that spoil the
[37:01] vine it's something a blind spot is is
[37:04] something wrong despite our best
[37:06] intentions our best effort that'll
[37:08] hinder you just like it hindered David
[37:11] it hindered David's communion with God
[37:13] it hindered his fellowship with God
[37:15] until there ended up being somebody
[37:17] dying because he left something undone
[37:20] he wasn't doing something right in that
[37:23] situation we got to deal with our blind
[37:25] spots amen now what brother R said here
[37:27] he said we see here what David done in
[37:29] the scripture reading of First
[37:31] Chronicles 13 his intentions were good
[37:35] but God now now think about this now
[37:38] y'all know how I preach sometimes I just
[37:40] I I like to preach in a way that just
[37:41] makes you think and meditate and reflect
[37:44] on what brother random was saying his
[37:46] intentions were good but God does not
[37:48] give us merits on good intentions now
[37:51] you see how easy it is to leave things
[37:53] undone we come to church many times and
[37:55] we've got a good intentions we've got
[37:57] good intentions about being a Christian
[37:58] we got good intentions but good
[38:00] intentions are not enough oh good
[38:03] intentions are not enough my friend
[38:05] there's only one way to serve god
[38:07] brother brandom said and that's by doing
[38:08] his will at his command I well of course
[38:12] every everybody tonight if we would
[38:13] examine ourselves we would all say I
[38:14] want to do his will but when it really
[38:17] gets down to the nitty-gritty when it's
[38:19] really laid there in front of you are
[38:21] you willing to do his will are you
[38:24] willing to do what he's asking and what
[38:26] he's asking is for us to just believe
[38:28] him brother R said one great thing about
[38:31] God he has not left us without knowing
[38:33] what's the truth and how to do it he
[38:35] wouldn't be just to punish us for doing
[38:37] something that we didn't know how it was
[38:39] going to be done and then let us stumble
[38:41] into something he is not that kind of a
[38:44] God so he let David know what he was
[38:47] supposed to be doing David knew David
[38:49] knew the right approach the what right
[38:51] way to carry that art oh
[38:55] goodness
[38:57] I'm all twisted up
[39:05] here I apologize yall he knew the right
[39:09] way the right approach to carry that Arc
[39:10] he knew the right way to worship and and
[39:12] you and I know the right way to worship
[39:14] thank God we know the truth we know the
[39:16] right way to approach God we know how to
[39:18] get to God and and brother R said how we
[39:22] know we know the truth and how to walk
[39:24] in it and how it work now you think
[39:25] about these we know how to how to get to
[39:27] God we know how it works we know how to
[39:30] get healing how the the recipe for all
[39:32] these things is laying there in the word
[39:34] how do you get healing you repent of
[39:36] your sins and lay it before God have
[39:38] faith wait on God and watch God go to
[39:40] work how do you get somewhere with God
[39:43] by believe in what he's done and have
[39:44] confidence look looking brother Bram
[39:47] said he's a God that speaks the word and
[39:49] expects his children to believe it now
[39:53] there's an expectation laying there in
[39:54] front of every one of us tonight that he
[39:56] Expect When God Says something he
[39:58] expects for us to believe it he doesn't
[40:00] he he's not anticipating for us to get
[40:02] all worked up and all emotional and all
[40:04] in a big tizzy or something but they
[40:06] have confidence in God what if God said
[40:08] something we have we can have confidence
[40:10] we don't have to get all worked up and
[40:11] get all and a big tizzy or something uh
[40:14] watching things maybe maybe go a a
[40:16] little different way than the way that
[40:17] he he we expect but to just have
[40:20] confidence that no matter what happens I
[40:22] I I I believe I certainly believe that
[40:24] tonight every Christian here can be a
[40:26] real Optimist can be somebody that can
[40:30] be like joob laying there on an as sheep
[40:32] that says well despite all of these
[40:34] things yet I know that in my flesh I
[40:36] shall see God a real Christian is going
[40:38] to be an optimist no matter what life
[40:40] throws at you always looking up speaking
[40:42] up talking up working up you're you're
[40:45] looking up to what God has already said
[40:47] you're not looking down you're not
[40:48] talking down to your children you're not
[40:50] talking down to somebody else but you're
[40:52] speaking up up up always because that's
[40:55] the way that God wants to go up
[40:57] always and oh thank God that you can
[41:00] know how to get to God you can know how
[41:03] to meet God and then brother Bram said
[41:05] in them days they had only one meeting
[41:07] place where they could meet God and that
[41:09] was at the ark under the blood oh he
[41:12] said that's the only that's the only
[41:14] meeting place yet under the blood The
[41:16] Mercy Seat was sprinkled to give Mercy
[41:18] to the worshiper the asker when he come
[41:20] to ask the petition of God so if you
[41:23] want to get anywhere with God tonight oh
[41:25] if You' got that token life to hold over
[41:27] to hold over your prayer you can have
[41:29] confidence that God hears your prayer
[41:31] because you coming the way that God
[41:33] prescribed to us to come under the blood
[41:36] covered under the blood that God made a
[41:38] sacrifice to us as he shed his blood on
[41:40] the cross and you're coming not with
[41:42] that the natural blood dripping over
[41:44] your life but the this that life that
[41:46] was in that blood applied to your life
[41:49] and you're coming to God with that in
[41:51] that way brother Brown said and God had
[41:53] a special routine the way you had to go
[41:55] to knew about that and he wouldn't
[41:57] accept anything else he won't accept any
[42:00] other way than by the blood the only way
[42:03] to get to God Is by The Blood Brother br
[42:05] will say I'm so glad that you can find
[42:07] reconciliation through the offering of
[42:10] the blood by hearing the word now look
[42:13] at that pattern there you want to get to
[42:14] the blood there's only way only way you
[42:16] can get to the blood is through the word
[42:18] the only way that you can get that get
[42:20] to that life the life that's in the
[42:22] blood is through the word by hearing the
[42:24] word and the washing of the Water by the
[42:27] word it actually cleanses us that as you
[42:29] hear the word it's actually cleaning you
[42:31] how is it cleaning you because it
[42:33] exposes these blind spots and things in
[42:35] your life it makes you realize there's
[42:37] something wrong it brings you it calls
[42:39] you to repentance you begin to ask God
[42:41] for forgiveness and it begins to have an
[42:43] effect in your life and David here we
[42:45] see that in his heart he wanted to do
[42:47] something that was good right he wanted
[42:50] to do something that was good amen he
[42:53] had no bad motive or no bad objective
[42:56] right the Ark of the Lord was away from
[42:59] the people and he wanted to bring the
[43:00] Ark of God back to his place so the
[43:03] people will consult God about the things
[43:06] that they wanted so he had a good motive
[43:08] he didn't have a bad motive he didn't
[43:11] have a bad objective he wanted to bring
[43:13] the Ark of the Lord to the people and
[43:15] brother said we find out through here
[43:17] where he put his name and that's the
[43:18] only place that he meets his worshipper
[43:20] and his name was Jesus Christ God's name
[43:23] is Jesus Christ and he said God had a
[43:25] way of doing things but David just
[43:27] thought that he would just do something
[43:28] for God anyhow and he never went about
[43:32] it in the right way
[43:35] amen now that's where it gets examined
[43:37] in times so many times we can think that
[43:39] we're doing things the right way but are
[43:42] doing it the way that God wants us to do
[43:43] it we can have all kinds of ideas about
[43:46] how that we we can ask the church to
[43:48] pray for something that ain't even right
[43:50] ask the church to sponsor something that
[43:51] ain't even right go out in the world and
[43:53] do something and maybe slap a label on
[43:55] it and say well well you know we're I'm
[43:58] as I've asked everybody to pray do
[44:00] something maybe go to a ball game or
[44:01] something and say they somewhere you
[44:03] know you're not supposed to be or I'm
[44:05] not preaching against ball games but you
[44:06] just
[44:07] something unroll the list and and you
[44:10] know you're not supposed to be doing it
[44:12] but you think that you think in your
[44:14] mind that you think you're supposed to
[44:15] you're you're doing it and you don't do
[44:16] it in the right way you so many times we
[44:19] think that we're we're we're worshiping
[44:21] the way that God wants us to do it or
[44:22] we're doing what God wants us to do but
[44:24] we're not and he said brother R would
[44:27] say God Reveals His word in his own
[44:29] predestinated season so he's building up
[44:32] for he's building up a recipe for us to
[44:35] know if we're doing if we're approaching
[44:37] God in the right way he's he's building
[44:39] up his recipe his his plan so that we
[44:41] can have confidence that we're approach
[44:43] our approach is
[44:45] correct now now let's back up a second
[44:48] because we know that God said he will do
[44:51] nothing until he reveals to his servants
[44:53] the prophets now there's one of the one
[44:55] of the main components of this thing he
[44:57] won't do anything until he reveals it to
[44:59] his servants the prophets so when God
[45:02] speaks his word to a prophet then if
[45:04] you're saying the same thing you're
[45:06] aligning yourself with what God spoke
[45:09] through that Prophet now that's why
[45:11] that's why I believe you know uh when
[45:13] you when me anyway when I started
[45:16] preaching you know you kind of think
[45:17] sometimes I just go sit under a tree and
[45:20] maybe would God will just kind of give
[45:21] me something to minister but I believe
[45:23] in this day God has given us a word to
[45:25] preach
[45:26] we're just our brother R said so many
[45:28] times he just said say what I say just
[45:31] say what I say in other words there's a
[45:33] track there's a line to preach for that
[45:35] goes from being born again to adoption
[45:38] to a Rapture and there's a lot of little
[45:40] odds and ends and things that we can
[45:41] preach but he just said say what I
[45:43] preach there's a lot of I could go and
[45:45] break apart all the candlesticks and all
[45:47] the types and different lot of things
[45:48] but you you won't be preaching that that
[45:51] line from being born again to adoption
[45:54] to all the way up to to take us to a
[45:56] Rapture so if we're saying what brother
[45:58] Brandon preached then we can have
[46:00] confidence that we're preaching along
[46:02] the lines that God wanted to in this
[46:04] season so we're not preaching we're not
[46:07] preaching what Martin Luther said
[46:08] although it's part it's part of the
[46:10] recipe we're not just preaching what
[46:12] John Wesley said but now we're preaching
[46:14] what God sent To Us by a prophet to
[46:17] unfold to us the complete revelation of
[46:20] Jesus Christ in this day and so to that
[46:22] you see the recipe there is you've got
[46:24] to get under the word for your day
[46:26] you've got to receive what God has for
[46:28] you to receive in the season that it was
[46:31] given so we're not living in the season
[46:33] of Martin Luther we're not living in the
[46:35] season of John Wesley but we're we're
[46:37] living in the season of a Casto
[46:39] unfolding of the seven seal revelation
[46:41] of the seven Mysteries of the Thunders
[46:43] we're living in that kind of a season
[46:46] now brother R said how could Martin
[46:48] Luther a no a message about note about
[46:51] the message today Martin Luther could
[46:53] not have known about the message today
[46:55] how how could the Presbyterians the
[46:57] Presbyterians could not have known about
[46:59] the message of today Martin Luther oh
[47:02] think about this Martin Luther read the
[47:04] same Bible we did but it wasn't time in
[47:07] his day for him to understand the things
[47:09] that we can preach about because God
[47:12] sent a prophet and that's what we're
[47:13] preaching that's what we're called to
[47:15] preach not just the little pity Patty
[47:17] BTY things but what God sent through a
[47:20] prophet he said Wesley said read the
[47:22] same Bible Marthur Martin Luther did but
[47:25] Wesley was not sent to preach what
[47:27] Martin Luther was sent to preach Wesley
[47:29] was sent to preach what God sent him to
[47:32] preach and the Pentecostals read the
[47:34] same Bible that we read and Jesus would
[47:37] say brother man would say Jesus read the
[47:40] same Bible that the Pharisees read now
[47:42] to think about that that different
[47:44] groups can read the same Bible and read
[47:47] it a different way that we're reading
[47:49] the same Bible that the Pharisees read
[47:52] and that Martin Luther read but but now
[47:55] that we're preaching in something that's
[47:57] greater it's grown into because it's a
[47:59] different season it's a different time
[48:01] it's a time for us to understand not
[48:04] just in park not through like a lattice
[48:06] looking at something dark and Shadow but
[48:09] so now we can see the fullest the full
[48:11] revelation of Jesus Christ and brother
[48:14] and would say God reveals this word in
[48:16] the seas in it to whom he chooses to
[48:19] reveal it to aren't you so glad tonight
[48:22] that he chose to reveal it to you he
[48:25] knew that you would wanted he knew that
[48:27] before the foundation of the world that
[48:29] you'd be sitting here tonight I I think
[48:31] that's maybe one of the things that you
[48:33] go to a camp meeting or somewhere and
[48:35] they they'll really highlight the fact
[48:37] that you're supposed to be sitting here
[48:39] tonight but I want to highlight tonight
[48:41] that here under the Wednesday night
[48:43] sitting here in the tire in middle of
[48:44] the week service God knew that you would
[48:47] be here before the foundation of the
[48:49] world he knew you'd be sitting here and
[48:51] he knew that you would want it and he
[48:53] chose you to reveal it to God God
[48:55] chooses who he reveals it to he chose
[48:58] that before the foundation of the world
[49:00] and he knew that you would be sitting
[49:02] here in the season of this time in the
[49:04] time when this would be preached when
[49:07] this would be revealed brother B said
[49:10] it's the Sun that brings a seed through
[49:11] it stages now you think you think of the
[49:14] winter time the sun is only shining for
[49:16] a few hours a day in the springtime it
[49:19] shines forth a little bit more in the
[49:21] summertime it's just maybe 12 hours a
[49:24] day and there's different Seasons where
[49:26] that same sun is drawing up the seed
[49:29] from the ground the same sun is pulling
[49:32] up that seed through the different
[49:34] stages of life it's the sun that's
[49:37] pulling it was the same Sun the same
[49:40] Holy Ghost and power that pulled that
[49:42] life up all the way down through all the
[49:44] different ages from Martin Luther the
[49:46] John Westley Pentecost up up up and till
[49:49] finally we're in this age and brother B
[49:51] said when it's tender and young bring it
[49:53] out of the ground the sea then give it
[49:55] its leaves in another stage of the Sun
[49:58] hot sun will kill it if it's the
[50:00] ripening seed or ripening time so he
[50:03] regulates the Sun and regulates nature
[50:06] to meet his word yeah oh think about
[50:09] that that even in your own life he
[50:12] regulated the sun was regulating your
[50:15] growth there was a time when you just
[50:17] couldn't take the abundance of the word
[50:18] it would have killed too much word kills
[50:20] the plant but there's a time when you
[50:22] could only take just a little bit but
[50:23] that's still that same son was pulling
[50:27] and drawing you drawing you to himself
[50:30] and brother RMA said who is it that will
[50:32] dare he's talking about he's talking
[50:34] about the life drawing how could you
[50:36] look at a little plant that's just
[50:38] barely come out of the ground and say
[50:40] well I don't think that's the real thing
[50:42] how could you look at something look at
[50:44] something and and criticize how can we
[50:45] look at one another and criticize and
[50:47] say well I don't think you're the real
[50:49] thing I don't oh brother there's that
[50:51] scripture in the Bible that says wait
[50:53] until it grows up wait wait until the te
[50:56] wheat and the tears are grown up
[50:58] together before you go pluck it out wait
[51:00] and see and brother R say who is it that
[51:02] will dare to correct him and say now
[51:05] Lord you made a mistake you made a
[51:08] mistake by putting this man in the
[51:10] ministry this man doesn't believe like
[51:12] we believe who is going to tell God he
[51:15] is wrong in
[51:20] itly sometimes we get so critical we
[51:23] want to put somebody out when God might
[51:26] still be working on them and drawing
[51:28] them and pulling them oh I'm so glad we
[51:32] got a God that knows what he's doing
[51:35] when so many people could have been
[51:37] critical of Me Maybe still are critical
[51:39] of me will you put it whatever category
[51:42] it needs to be in but yet God's still
[51:44] drawing God's still working God's still
[51:46] pulling brother R would say he made this
[51:48] statement in this sermon he knows what
[51:51] he is doing he knows what he's doing as
[51:54] he's drawing he said he knows who to
[51:56] choose and who not to choose what to do
[52:00] and when to do it I'm talking about what
[52:02] to do now what to preach to a people
[52:04] that need it in the season that we're
[52:06] living in when to do it in the seventh
[52:08] Church age as a bride is being called
[52:10] out not just Brides brides churches
[52:12] churches but a bride that will be the
[52:14] fullness of the godhead bodily he said
[52:17] no matter how much we think that a
[52:19] certain person is qualified to do a
[52:21] certain job God knows who is qualified
[52:24] for the time and the season or the time
[52:26] and the right time to do it God knows
[52:28] who was qualified he said the real true
[52:31] Christian the real True Believer in God
[52:34] Waits upon the Lord for these
[52:38] things oh he said
[52:41] wait now that was a lesson there was a
[52:43] lesson just to meditate on for a moment
[52:46] wait when God says something wait he
[52:49] told the the the disciples go go to
[52:51] Jerusalem and wait until you be and de
[52:54] with power from on high
[52:56] and brother R would say wait wait on
[52:57] your ministry if you feel like you're
[52:59] called to be a preacher wait and see he
[53:03] said if you feel a call be sure that
[53:05] it's God be sure that it's right now I
[53:07] find it just in life now this is a good
[53:09] life lesson sometimes it's good to just
[53:12] wait and not just rush into something
[53:15] just rush head long but just wait and
[53:17] wait and pray and T and wait and see
[53:20] what God has to say about it search
[53:22] through the scriptures and see what God
[53:24] has to say about your decision but wait
[53:26] and and see if see before you just jump
[53:29] jump into it he said be sure that is
[53:32] timely of what you're saying the Bible
[53:35] said they that wait upon the Lord shall
[53:37] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[53:40] with the wings like an eagle they shall
[53:42] run and not be
[53:44] weary if they'll walk they'll not faint
[53:48] and to a Christian now waiting means
[53:51] expecting when you see a promised Lona
[53:53] there in the Bible you wait with
[53:55] expectation I believe it's going to
[53:58] happen that's what brother Ram told us
[54:00] when we come to church you come to
[54:01] church expecting expecting whatever your
[54:04] need is you come to church expecting to
[54:06] be healed respecting to receive
[54:08] expecting receive a blessing expecting
[54:11] to hear from God and that's our problem
[54:13] so many times we don't come to church
[54:15] expecting to hear from God we've got our
[54:17] little our little ideas about the person
[54:19] behind the pullit we've got our ideas
[54:21] about the church maybe we got all these
[54:22] ideas built up and we failed to expect
[54:25] that God is going to speak to us but if
[54:28] we'll come like that waiting waiting to
[54:30] hear from God and expecting with
[54:33] patience now that's how a Christian
[54:35] Waits with patience patience that kind
[54:38] of a patience if you got patience you
[54:40] can wait on your brother and you can
[54:42] wait on God that's what real patience is
[54:44] the ability to wait sit on that ashle
[54:48] Heap like job and just wait for God to
[54:50] move sit there and wait and see the
[54:53] Deliverance of God if you have if you've
[54:54] got got wayward children sit there and
[54:57] wait not in a tizzy not in a frame of
[54:59] mind where you don't even know what's up
[55:01] and what's down but wait with confidence
[55:04] that you serve a God that hears your
[55:06] prayer wait believing trust and faith is
[55:11] how a Christian Waits with spiritual
[55:13] preparedness oh you made yourself ready
[55:15] you made yourself ready as much as you
[55:18] can like that sermon that brother R
[55:20] preached be still and know or be certain
[55:22] of God be certain of God when I when
[55:24] youve done everything that you can well
[55:27] you've dotted all the eyes and all the
[55:29] teas that you know how to Dot and
[55:31] everything that you can do you've done
[55:33] then all you can do is wait but now you
[55:36] can wait in confidence knowing you've
[55:38] done everything that you can and now you
[55:41] can wait a trust in God's Providence oh
[55:45] as a Christian can't we do that can't we
[55:47] have that kind of a confidence in a God
[55:49] that still influences lives that still
[55:52] influences us that can still move like
[55:55] that that Dove spirit that moved over
[55:57] the water when the world was created he
[55:59] could still move over your children's
[56:00] Hearts he could still move over your
[56:03] wayward loved ones and draw them back to
[56:05] himself that's the kind of confidence
[56:08] that God wants us to have and brother R
[56:10] said notice David king of Israel just
[56:13] anointed Samuel poured the oil upon him
[56:16] and he was chosen of God to be king of
[56:19] Israel and David got this Revelation to
[56:23] bring the Ark of the Lord up to the city
[56:26] of David now you think about what
[56:28] brother R's laying out for us that David
[56:31] was just anointed he wasn't just some
[56:35] some uh Center out in a strip club or
[56:38] something he was anointed the prophet of
[56:41] God had poured all on his head and he
[56:45] was chosen of God and David got a
[56:48] revelation but yet the sum of the story
[56:51] is he did it wrong he did it wrong and
[56:54] at the end of the story there was death
[56:56] if you do it wrong it's going to bring
[56:58] death David got this Revelation to bring
[57:01] the Ark of the Lord up to the city of of
[57:03] David because that's what God wanted to
[57:06] happen he wanted that Ark to be put he
[57:08] wanted the ark to be restored amongst
[57:10] the people but David did it all wrong a
[57:14] revelation is something that surprising
[57:17] and you didn't know about the Revelation
[57:19] was the ark needs to be restored it does
[57:22] in this day it needs to be restored the
[57:24] word needs to be restored let's get back
[57:26] let's get back to the original truth and
[57:29] brother B would say now there is nothing
[57:31] wrong but you see David went at it wrong
[57:35] right it wasn't the prophet Nathaniel
[57:37] that got the Revelation now that goes
[57:40] back to what my point earlier God will
[57:42] do nothing until first he reveals it to
[57:45] his servants the prophets so in this day
[57:48] if you get right unline in line under
[57:50] what the prophet said just say what the
[57:53] prophet said just just do what the
[57:55] prophet said if the prophet said it
[57:57] that's that's that's my that's
[57:59] everything that we hang everything on
[58:01] the prophet said it I I'm talking about
[58:04] a real Revelation not just not just
[58:06] quotes that we can argue over and things
[58:08] that we can debate over whether this or
[58:11] whether that but I'm talking about a
[58:12] real revelation of what our Prophet said
[58:14] in this day and he said it was not the
[58:17] prophet Nathaniel that got the
[58:18] Revelation it was David the king that
[58:21] got the
[58:22] Revelation David said now let's get back
[58:25] to god let's get back to the right thing
[58:27] let's go down and bring the presence of
[58:28] God into the city let's hold a Revival
[58:31] let's bring the people back but he got
[58:32] the Revelation which seemed to be good
[58:35] but it wasn't the will of God now now
[58:38] look he how he did he this is just how a
[58:40] lot of us do we want everybody's opinion
[58:43] but God's opinion yeah we want to know
[58:45] we want to somebody's doing wrong in the
[58:47] church and they they're they're about to
[58:49] fall flat on their face and and they
[58:51] want to go find some Minister that will
[58:53] bless like a like a priest bless what
[58:56] they're doing I bless what they want to
[58:59] go find somebody to say what you're
[59:01] doing is right they but they don't want
[59:03] what God said they want somebody they
[59:06] want to go find their friend to say you
[59:07] know I think what you're doing is right
[59:09] they want to go find somebody at school
[59:11] there anybody to to bless or to to to to
[59:14] kind of back up what they're doing other
[59:17] than what the God said am so this is
[59:20] what David did he brother said he went
[59:22] to the church nominal and asked if it
[59:24] out of the Revival sure come on I
[59:27] believe it's a good thing he said the
[59:28] priest now look how he the priests the
[59:31] scribes the captains of thousands the
[59:33] captains of hundreds and he consulted
[59:35] them was this the will of the Lord and
[59:37] they all said it was they said it was
[59:39] sure what you do now is that oh God
[59:42] wants us to God wants each of us to have
[59:44] our own Revelation he wants you to have
[59:47] a revelation of where you're supposed to
[59:49] be going to church and where you're
[59:50] where you're supposed to be living and
[59:52] where you're supposed to be going to
[59:53] work what you're supposed to be doing in
[59:56] life what your position in life is and
[59:58] see you can't you can't go through life
[1:00:00] holding on to somebody's coattails if
[1:00:03] you hold on to somebody's coattails
[1:00:05] you're holding on to what God revealed
[1:00:07] to them but it might not be applicable
[1:00:09] to you you got to have your own
[1:00:11] experience what happens if you're
[1:00:13] holding on to somebody's coattails and
[1:00:15] then God takes them out of the way and
[1:00:17] you can't hold on to their cails anymore
[1:00:19] and your whole life experience is just
[1:00:21] ruined it's destroyed because that was
[1:00:24] your experience to hold on to your
[1:00:26] pastor's coils or hold on to a Deacon's
[1:00:29] coils or some man when you're supposed
[1:00:31] to be holding on to God you're supposed
[1:00:33] to have a relationship with God not with
[1:00:36] a man that's what God wants you to do
[1:00:39] the priest the scribes the captains of
[1:00:41] thousands everybody except for God he
[1:00:44] said not oh not what do you think not
[1:00:47] what do they think but what does God
[1:00:49] think oh that's what I want to know
[1:00:51] church tonight I want to know what God
[1:00:53] thinks oh when you get into your little
[1:00:55] prayer closet which so many people have
[1:00:57] stopped doing by the way people don't
[1:00:59] even hardly pray anymore because they
[1:01:00] don't want they don't care about what
[1:01:02] God thinks they don't care about a
[1:01:04] personal experience anymore they just
[1:01:07] want to come and come to church and go
[1:01:08] through the motions and do the things
[1:01:10] that they think that they should be
[1:01:12] doing and not have a real true genuine
[1:01:15] experience with God that's why brother
[1:01:17] BR laid it out he said in the days of
[1:01:19] Saul they left DOL Consulting God by the
[1:01:23] ark they left off W to know what God
[1:01:26] Said by the urum Thum they left off
[1:01:30] doing that instead of asking the source
[1:01:33] that he should have asked he consulted
[1:01:36] his captains and his great man he failed
[1:01:40] to ask the main resource that God always
[1:01:43] deals
[1:01:45] through and you can find so many
[1:01:47] examples through the scripture like that
[1:01:50] story that I like to quote a lot of
[1:01:52] times where the Prophet prophesied that
[1:01:55] Josiah was going to be born here comes
[1:01:57] another Prophet to tell him contrary oh
[1:02:00] you've got to have your own Revelation
[1:02:02] Church you've got to have your own
[1:02:04] experience to where if some other
[1:02:06] Prophet comes out from the bushes and
[1:02:09] tells you something contrary you got to
[1:02:11] have enough confidence like Paul said if
[1:02:13] anybody if an angel from heaven comes
[1:02:16] and says something contrary to what I
[1:02:19] have preached let him be a
[1:02:22] cursed David's brother said David his
[1:02:25] intention was good his motive was good
[1:02:27] his objective was good and to bring a
[1:02:30] Revival in the city bring the people
[1:02:32] back to God but he never consulted the
[1:02:35] way God told him to do it how do we
[1:02:38] consult the way God tells us to do
[1:02:39] things in this age oh let me see what a
[1:02:42] prophet said about it let me compare it
[1:02:44] back with the word of God in the season
[1:02:47] and the time that we're living in let me
[1:02:49] compare it back understanding the day
[1:02:52] and the hour that we're living in and
[1:02:53] brother said all the people agreed and
[1:02:55] the priest and that the King was right
[1:02:57] they needed the ark back in the city
[1:02:59] they needed a Revival they needed the
[1:03:01] presence of God but God had not promised
[1:03:04] to reveal his word in its season to the
[1:03:06] peoples he never promised to reveal it
[1:03:08] to the king in the season that sounds
[1:03:11] contrary doesn't it but God you're
[1:03:13] talking about having a personal
[1:03:15] revelation it better line up with what
[1:03:17] the prophet says everything we do amen
[1:03:21] every action we take amen everything we
[1:03:23] stand for was must line up with the word
[1:03:27] that we've heard in this
[1:03:28] age and that's kind of maybe a difficult
[1:03:31] thing to articulate my revelation God
[1:03:33] will give me a revelation but it's not
[1:03:35] going to be something like just sitting
[1:03:36] up under a tree like the gnostics
[1:03:39] believed in the early church that we can
[1:03:41] just come up with some idea that doesn't
[1:03:43] line up with the Bible it's got to line
[1:03:46] up with what brother brandham
[1:03:48] said like in the days of
[1:03:50] Micah when they oh they had a they had
[1:03:53] they had a re Revelation they knew that
[1:03:56] that that land Joshua divided it for the
[1:03:58] people and give it to them and the
[1:04:01] Philistines had taken it over and they
[1:04:03] knew that that land was there but yet it
[1:04:05] wasn't time to take it they knew it was
[1:04:08] time they had a revelation that that
[1:04:09] land was theirs but and Ahab said we got
[1:04:12] a place up there at ramth Gilead that
[1:04:14] actually belongs to us but Jehoshaphat
[1:04:16] said we need to we need to consult the
[1:04:19] Lord first let's see what the Lord has
[1:04:22] to say about it right
[1:04:25] and there were 400 other prophets 400
[1:04:29] others that stood separate from Micah oh
[1:04:33] God if God can just get a hold of one
[1:04:35] man that's all he's looking for tonight
[1:04:37] just somebody that he can get a hold of
[1:04:39] and use their life somebody that will
[1:04:41] stand for him even if there's 400 other
[1:04:44] prophets 400 other people that believe
[1:04:46] different but if God's behind you if
[1:04:49] God's behind you how can you fail Micah
[1:04:51] said I saw all Israel scattered upon
[1:04:54] pulling the hills a sheep that have not
[1:04:55] a Shepherd what's what can we get from
[1:04:57] that it matters who you listen to Micah
[1:05:00] versus 400 other prophets but it
[1:05:02] mattered because Micah's word was right
[1:05:05] and brother R would say you say
[1:05:06] Prophets The Very man that consented to
[1:05:09] kill Jesus Christ prophesied because it
[1:05:12] was his office he was high priest that
[1:05:14] year these men looked upon it in a
[1:05:17] natural sense it belongs to us but you
[1:05:20] see they didn't find the word and will
[1:05:23] of God it might say on paper that it
[1:05:25] belongs to you it might say on paper you
[1:05:28] can read it in the Bible it belongs to
[1:05:30] you but you better wait on the will of
[1:05:32] God wait on the will of God until you
[1:05:34] can actually claim it the way that God
[1:05:36] wants you to claim it going the right
[1:05:39] Avenue and the right Channel with the
[1:05:41] right approach and the right motives and
[1:05:43] all of those things so that God can
[1:05:46] manifest it in your
[1:05:48] life Micah come down and he had a vision
[1:05:51] and it was absolutely contrary to the
[1:05:53] others
[1:05:54] because why it's got to be the word with
[1:05:56] the word and at the season
[1:06:00] now now now listen church tonight listen
[1:06:04] what brother Ram saying he said David
[1:06:05] sent singers and he sent people with
[1:06:08] Harps oh they were having a real good
[1:06:10] worship service as they carry that art
[1:06:12] they were praising God and believing
[1:06:14] that they were doing everything right he
[1:06:16] sent people with Harps with trumpets and
[1:06:18] they done every religious thing that
[1:06:20] they knowed how to do and still God God
[1:06:24] was not in
[1:06:25] it now now look look what happens when
[1:06:28] God is in it when God was in it when
[1:06:31] Solomon dedicated the temple just about
[1:06:33] before they even brought the ark I think
[1:06:35] it was before they that before they
[1:06:36] could even get everything situated the
[1:06:39] the Holy Ghost just the presence of God
[1:06:41] filled that place so much until they
[1:06:43] couldn't even they couldn't even see to
[1:06:45] be able to worship that's what the Bible
[1:06:47] says that the priest could not even see
[1:06:49] in order to minister to the people oh
[1:06:51] but when when they when everything was
[1:06:53] all out of kilter it just didn't work
[1:06:55] right brother R said David shouted with
[1:06:57] all of his might and he screamed and he
[1:06:59] jumped and he went through every
[1:07:00] religious motion that there could be and
[1:07:02] still God was not in it everything David
[1:07:05] did it didn't work oh if you want to get
[1:07:07] the real baptism of the Holy Ghost if
[1:07:09] you in need of a blessing you come
[1:07:11] according to God's approach you come
[1:07:13] according to the way God said it if you
[1:07:15] want to see a blessing in the church
[1:07:16] come according to the way that God said
[1:07:18] it and make sure that his will you're
[1:07:20] aligned with his will and doing it the
[1:07:22] way that God wants it son he said their
[1:07:26] Rel religious emotion and stuff was
[1:07:29] great their intentions was great their
[1:07:32] Crusade was great their singing was
[1:07:34] great their dancing was great their
[1:07:37] shouting was great their music was great
[1:07:41] and they had the ark they had the ark
[1:07:43] and all that represented they had the
[1:07:46] ark and all of the things that were on
[1:07:48] the inside of it the tables of stone and
[1:07:50] the the Almond bud and all the the and
[1:07:54] all that there but what good is the ark
[1:07:56] what good is all of that without God
[1:07:58] it's just a wooden box just a couple of
[1:08:01] tables of stone what good does it do to
[1:08:04] be baptized if you're not first
[1:08:05] repenting right I'm going to go baptize
[1:08:08] myself get get baptized and not repent
[1:08:10] what good does it do what good does it
[1:08:11] do to take communion and become a
[1:08:14] hypocrite if you don't live the life and
[1:08:16] believe the rest of God's word what good
[1:08:18] does it do oh oh this might be a kind of
[1:08:20] a hard thing to preach on tonight but
[1:08:22] what good does it do if you're taking
[1:08:23] communion What You Won't Do the rest
[1:08:25] what good does it do if you take
[1:08:27] communion just to please your mama and
[1:08:28] your daddy and do all these things what
[1:08:30] good does it do if you leave the rest
[1:08:32] undone what good does any of it do
[1:08:35] without God that's what I want is I want
[1:08:38] God I want God to look at my life and be
[1:08:40] pleased with it I want God to look at my
[1:08:42] sacrifice and be pleased with it I want
[1:08:45] everything that I do cuz what what good
[1:08:47] is any of it without
[1:08:50] God he said take part of it not the rest
[1:08:53] of but it shows there is something wrong
[1:08:56] what good are all the rituals and the
[1:08:58] sacrifices without God take all of it
[1:09:01] the word and the blood what good is the
[1:09:03] word without the blood what good is the
[1:09:05] doctrine without the life what good are
[1:09:08] the symbols without the reality now
[1:09:10] think about that what good is the word
[1:09:12] if it's if the life cannot be manifest
[1:09:15] in your life what good is it to have all
[1:09:17] these symbols that we read about and not
[1:09:19] see it manifest what good is it and
[1:09:21] brother R said when all this happens see
[1:09:24] what happens when God and his age and
[1:09:26] his time is not considered just a
[1:09:28] people's idea that's right wait
[1:09:32] wait now this feels like kind of a harsh
[1:09:35] message tonight doesn't it but these are
[1:09:38] the things that brother branam brother R
[1:09:40] preached this sermon two times before he
[1:09:43] went off the scene and the last time he
[1:09:45] preached it was a month before he went
[1:09:47] off the scene and if you want to really
[1:09:49] get the essence of some kind of a
[1:09:52] cutting message you go back and listen
[1:09:53] listen to trying to do God a service
[1:09:56] without it being his will I want you to
[1:09:58] encourage I I think sometimes you know
[1:10:00] you preach and Minister people go back
[1:10:02] and listen to your sermons over and over
[1:10:04] again I don't want you to do that
[1:10:06] tonight don't listen to me go listen to
[1:10:09] what your Prophet said and see what he
[1:10:11] told you before he went off the scene
[1:10:14] see what he said at the end of that
[1:10:16] sermon and let it cut you deep let it
[1:10:19] cut and Scar and and mold you into the
[1:10:21] image of what he's trying to get across
[1:10:23] there at the end of that sermon he said
[1:10:25] wait you might want it but what does God
[1:10:29] say about it and that's what I want
[1:10:32] tonight I want to know what God said
[1:10:33] about anything before we make a decision
[1:10:36] before we do anything before I take a
[1:10:38] step in my life I want to know what God
[1:10:40] said about it I want to make sure that
[1:10:42] I'm lined up with the prophet of the age
[1:10:44] he said wait let me see what he said
[1:10:47] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:10:49] their strength but they consulted
[1:10:52] everyone else everybody else was
[1:10:55] consulted but
[1:10:59] God he said they consulted only the
[1:11:01] priest of that day the theologians the
[1:11:04] denominations and noticed by doing that
[1:11:06] Consulting the priest and Consulting the
[1:11:08] congregation Consulting the people they
[1:11:11] did it
[1:11:12] wrong the ark was the word we know
[1:11:15] that's right because the ark is Christ
[1:11:17] and Christ is the word see the ark or
[1:11:18] the word was not put in its first
[1:11:21] ordained original ordained
[1:11:24] position let us see brother R said what
[1:11:27] happens when God and his age and his
[1:11:30] time is not considered just the people's
[1:11:35] idea cuz we all we all got blind spots
[1:11:39] we all got our own ideas about the way
[1:11:42] things should work and the way things
[1:11:43] should go we all got these things these
[1:11:46] faults in ourself that we don't even
[1:11:49] recognize oh but the word will expose it
[1:11:52] the word will reveal our problems and
[1:11:55] the word will correct it he said by
[1:11:58] going to the priest by going to the
[1:11:59] theologians and by going to the military
[1:12:02] forces and not even considering their
[1:12:04] God sent message of the hour Nathan they
[1:12:06] did it wrong they went and picked up the
[1:12:08] arc and put it upon a new cart a new
[1:12:11] denomination going to start up and not
[1:12:13] upon the god-given
[1:12:15] ordained way to pack
[1:12:17] it now what's the ordained way to pack
[1:12:20] it not on some not on some animal
[1:12:22] carrying it like that pick that Ark up
[1:12:24] the Levites pick it up and put it over
[1:12:28] their heart that's the way God wants his
[1:12:31] word packed he wants to get a hold of
[1:12:33] somebody's heart he wants somebody to
[1:12:36] yield themselves to him if he could just
[1:12:38] get a hold of one person's heart
[1:12:41] somebody that'll stand in the face of
[1:12:43] 400 prophets or a thousand prophets or
[1:12:46] if everybody in the world was a prophet
[1:12:48] that preached contrary to what you
[1:12:50] believed it wouldn't matter at all he
[1:12:52] said you got to go back to the way that
[1:12:55] God said do it they put it on the
[1:12:56] shoulders of the Levites and that was
[1:12:58] over the heart the ark the word is not
[1:13:00] to be packed upon a new denomination now
[1:13:03] now we're not we're not struggling
[1:13:04] tonight with a denomination what we're
[1:13:06] struggling with is our own ideas and our
[1:13:09] own thoughts about how we think things
[1:13:11] should go but you don't pack it that way
[1:13:14] you don't pack it on some theories of
[1:13:16] some man some theories of somebody's
[1:13:18] ideas but you pack it over your heart
[1:13:21] over the heart where God can speak to
[1:13:23] even reveal himself to you the word of
[1:13:26] God is not to be handled by
[1:13:27] denominations it's to be handled by the
[1:13:29] heart of a man where God can come in
[1:13:32] there and reveal himself oh that's why
[1:13:35] so many times he would reiterate God
[1:13:37] don't care how much education you got he
[1:13:40] wants your heart he wants somebody's
[1:13:43] heart that he can soften up and make it
[1:13:45] from being Stony and rough and and won't
[1:13:47] come to the altar won't raise their hand
[1:13:49] and won't say Amen to where they'll give
[1:13:52] themselves holy to God the only one
[1:13:54] thing that Christ will be wrapped in and
[1:13:57] that's your heart not your Creed he
[1:13:59] wants your heart and then you think
[1:14:01] about this as we're approaching the
[1:14:02] holiday time that that's the only thing
[1:14:05] that he can be wrapped in there's no
[1:14:07] swaddling clothes that we can wrap him
[1:14:09] in today but he can be wrapped up in
[1:14:10] your heart and that's where God wants to
[1:14:14] be Psalm 119 said th word if I hid in my
[1:14:17] heart that I might sin against thee
[1:14:19] where not in my head but in my heart and
[1:14:21] Jeremiah 31 I will put my law in their
[1:14:24] inward parts and write it in their
[1:14:26] hearts and will be their God and they
[1:14:28] shall be my people and brother R would
[1:14:30] say notice upon the shoulders of the
[1:14:33] priests and David and all the priests
[1:14:35] that really ought to have know
[1:14:37] better but what was
[1:14:39] it he said the priest should have knowed
[1:14:42] better the scribes the theologians
[1:14:44] should have knowed better because the
[1:14:46] word said not to do that not to carry it
[1:14:50] in a cart pulled by an animal not to do
[1:14:53] that but to carry it on the levite
[1:14:54] shoulder over the heart oh there's no
[1:14:58] idea I'm just saying what brother Ram
[1:15:00] said there's no idea no thought no man
[1:15:04] no man's idea greater than God we must
[1:15:08] subject ourself to what God Said in the
[1:15:11] season and the time and the age that
[1:15:14] we're living sir the word for the season
[1:15:17] the time that they were living in was
[1:15:21] ignored ought to think now what are we
[1:15:23] talking about tonight that you can be
[1:15:24] real enthusiastic about coming to church
[1:15:27] you can be real enthusiastic about what
[1:15:28] you're doing you can be so stoked about
[1:15:31] what's happening but you can be
[1:15:33] enthusiastic and be
[1:15:36] wrong here's how what must take place to
[1:15:38] know you are right and we'll be closing
[1:15:41] in just a moment I was trying to go 45
[1:15:43] minutes tonight and we're already in an
[1:15:45] hour actually we're we're about 50
[1:15:51] minutes now you you've heard all these
[1:15:53] things before but tonight I'm just I'm
[1:15:55] just reiterating I'm calling I'm I'm
[1:15:57] restoring these things to your bringing
[1:15:59] bringing them to your remembrance he
[1:16:01] said notice there and following God and
[1:16:03] I want you to kind of jot this in your
[1:16:04] mind that keeps God's Commandments to do
[1:16:06] anything right for God to do God a
[1:16:08] service correctly there's five musts to
[1:16:10] do God's service correctly and these are
[1:16:13] all things laid out that to just
[1:16:15] reiterate what we've just been going
[1:16:17] over it's got to be his time it must be
[1:16:20] his time it must be the time the day and
[1:16:22] the hour that we're living it's time for
[1:16:24] the revelation of the son of man to be
[1:16:26] preached it's time for all these things
[1:16:27] to be preached he said what if Jesus
[1:16:29] would come and say now I tell you what
[1:16:31] we'll do we'll just go up on the mount
[1:16:33] like Moses did and get a new Declaration
[1:16:34] of LW he was that law amen and it must
[1:16:37] be his word it's got to be his word
[1:16:39] everything that we do is got to compare
[1:16:41] back to the word it's got to be his word
[1:16:43] it's got to be a present tense word a
[1:16:45] present tense word for the season and
[1:16:47] the time that we're living it's got to
[1:16:48] be his time and it's got to be his word
[1:16:50] it must be his word he said I don't care
[1:16:52] how much dignitary I don't care how many
[1:16:54] kings I don't care how many great
[1:16:56] preachers but compare everything back to
[1:16:58] the word and it must be by the person he
[1:17:01] has chose to give it and to do it it's
[1:17:04] got to be by the person that he chose he
[1:17:07] chose a person to deliver it and he
[1:17:09] chose a people to receive what was
[1:17:11] delivered it must come by the prophets
[1:17:14] and the prophet must be Vindicated amen
[1:17:16] and I'm I'm going to be winding down on
[1:17:18] this note to just kind of prepare to
[1:17:20] close but it must be V have you ever
[1:17:22] stopped to think about what it means to
[1:17:23] be
[1:17:24] Vindicated Vindicated means to be
[1:17:26] cleared from blame suspicion or doubt
[1:17:30] often after the fact in other words many
[1:17:33] people have maybe listened to brother
[1:17:34] R's message and thought well I don't
[1:17:36] know if that's true but you hang around
[1:17:39] long enough and let that word anchor in
[1:17:41] your life I know all the pillar of fire
[1:17:44] and all the all the pictures and things
[1:17:45] those are proofs but I'm talking about
[1:17:47] something different I'm talking about
[1:17:49] you begin to meditate on what he said
[1:17:51] and let it really anchor in your heart
[1:17:53] and soul and what maybe you originally
[1:17:54] thought was a little bit suspicious it
[1:17:57] begins to take root in your life and
[1:17:59] begins to change you and it removes all
[1:18:02] the doubt and that makes you the
[1:18:04] Vindication you the proof of the thing
[1:18:07] you sitting here tonight you are the
[1:18:10] proof and anything contrary to that word
[1:18:13] any man's idea anything like that will
[1:18:16] mess it up I'm talking about any
[1:18:18] influence contrary to the word will mess
[1:18:20] up the whole
[1:18:21] story
[1:18:24] let's wrap let's wrap
[1:18:25] up I I know I I feel everybody time to
[1:18:29] wrap up
[1:18:33] I'm anyway this thing this thing that
[1:18:36] David done without consulting the you
[1:18:39] and getting the word of the Lord for it
[1:18:40] it caused death to strike sincere people
[1:18:43] and brother Ram said as we as we're
[1:18:44] about to close he said they did two
[1:18:46] things wrong they went down there by not
[1:18:48] Consulting the word of God they didn't
[1:18:50] consult the word of God then when they
[1:18:53] did they went contrary to the word of
[1:18:55] God they didn't consult the word of God
[1:18:58] let's really anchor that in our hearts
[1:19:00] tonight the two things that they did
[1:19:01] wrong they didn't consult the word of
[1:19:03] God now that of course is going to lead
[1:19:06] into the next thing they went contrary
[1:19:08] to the word of God there's where you and
[1:19:11] I will always go astray if we don't
[1:19:13] consult the word of God let me see what
[1:19:15] God's word says about it and the Bible
[1:19:18] says in 1st Chronicles 13 the scripture
[1:19:20] we've been preaching from when they came
[1:19:22] under the threshing floor of chadon usza
[1:19:26] put forth his hand to hold the ark for
[1:19:28] The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the
[1:19:30] Lord was kindled against usza and he
[1:19:32] smote him because he put his hand to the
[1:19:34] ark and there he died before God when
[1:19:38] David saw this thing happened it woke
[1:19:40] him up now isn't that how we are so many
[1:19:44] times we got to be shaken to really wake
[1:19:46] up don't wake up too late out there
[1:19:49] brother he seen that death had hit
[1:19:53] what's the point brother R is making I
[1:19:54] don't care who says anything contrary to
[1:19:57] God's word I don't care who it is and
[1:19:59] he's laying it out all the ones I don't
[1:20:00] care don't care he said I don't care
[1:20:03] what I say brother brandom said I don't
[1:20:05] care what I say or anybody else says
[1:20:08] even putting it to his own self anybody
[1:20:11] says contrary to the word of God oh you
[1:20:14] just stay right with the word of God now
[1:20:18] there's a lesson for us all there's a
[1:20:19] lesson that sometimes takes us years to
[1:20:21] learn don't set your eyes on a man don't
[1:20:25] lift up don't get caught in the cult of
[1:20:28] personality don't lift up me or anybody
[1:20:31] else you stay right with word the word
[1:20:35] of God keep your eye on the word of God
[1:20:38] and nothing else he said look at the
[1:20:41] today the big Crusades that we've had
[1:20:42] across the land it's proven that it's
[1:20:44] been Vain and didn't Jesus here say now
[1:20:46] in Mark 7:7 in vain do they worship me
[1:20:50] what's he talking about that you can
[1:20:51] have all your dots your eyes dotted and
[1:20:54] all your tees crossed and every be be be
[1:20:57] real enthusiastic about it but yet be
[1:21:00] worshiping God in vain if you don't come
[1:21:05] according to those five musts what
[1:21:08] season are we living in what time are we
[1:21:11] living in who did God
[1:21:13] choose is it according to the word right
[1:21:16] all those things in anything contrary to
[1:21:19] the word and it season is inv
[1:21:23] V in vain did David bring the ark up in
