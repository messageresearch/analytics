[0:53] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name
[0:55] Amen amen
[1:00] [Music]
[1:04] the path to glory you will surely
[1:19] [Music]
[1:41] [Music]
[1:44] long for this day long for this day
[1:48] we're gonna read scripture if you don't
[1:50] mind around here real quick we're
[1:52] looking at two if you want to turn your
[1:55] Bibles listen chapter six or Romans what
[2:02] shall we say then shall we continue in
[2:03] sin that grace may abound paul says god
[2:06] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[2:10] live any longer therein no you're not
[2:13] that so many of us as were baptized into
[2:16] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[2:18] death therefore we are buried with him
[2:21] by baptism into death that like as
[2:25] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[2:26] the glory of the Father even so we also
[2:28] should walk in newness of life or if we
[2:32] have been planted together what we're
[2:34] gonna do we're gonna plant her and then
[2:37] we're gonna bring her back if we have
[2:40] been planted together in the likeness of
[2:42] his death we shall also in the light
[2:44] shall be also in the likeness of Israel
[2:47] knowing this that our old man is
[2:50] crucified with him that the body of sin
[2:54] might be I love that word destroyed that
[2:59] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[3:02] he that is dead is free from sin you're
[3:05] dead you're free from sin
[3:07] dead man can't sin that's right amen now
[3:10] if we'd be dead with Christ we believe
[3:13] that we shall also live with him knowing
[3:16] that Christ being raised from the dead
[3:18] diet no more death had no more dominion
[3:21] over him
[3:23] for in that he died he died unto sin
[3:26] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[3:27] under gun and listen to this likewise
[3:30] reckon you also yourself to be dead
[3:32] indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[3:37] through Jesus our Lord our sister has
[3:41] made a commitment to die let the old man
[3:47] be buried and then she come up and
[3:53] newness of life I tell you when I did
[3:57] this I laid down that old path I let
[4:03] that literal water and there's nothing
[4:04] to this literal water but I let it just
[4:06] I just let it wash everything right out
[4:08] of me when I came up out of that water I
[4:12] was an empty guy but God filled me with
[4:15] the Holy Ghost right after that that's
[4:17] the way it's supposed to be this is the
[4:21] promise this is the promise me that
[4:25] she'll received the Holy Ghost if she'll
[4:26] keep walking on this is not gonna give
[4:29] her the Holy Ghost she knows that she's
[4:30] been told before this is a step in the
[4:33] right direction that's right and a lot
[4:36] of people will take this step but
[4:38] they're not gonna take it under I'd
[4:40] under the identification of baptism as
[4:42] we're talking about now we're gonna put
[4:44] her in a name not entitled we're gonna
[4:49] baptize her in the name of God Almighty
[4:53] Himself you'll enter into that family of
[4:56] God you just keep walking in God you
[4:59] ever need help you know where it's that
[5:01] you got a whole family
[5:03] help you any way we can and back you up
[5:06] one time for saying so have no fear
[5:09] just like when we put you down in this
[5:11] watery grave die don't worry about the
[5:15] past that was gonna make you think about
[5:17] it don't worry about it is it the devil
[5:20] are yes he's a liar and the author of it
[5:23] masters not he's not the author of
[5:26] confusion he's the author of life so our
[5:29] sisters made a commitment and today
[5:31] we've all come today to witness this
[5:32] everybody around dears church members
[5:34] were witnessing then our sister has made
[5:37] a commitment to die yes and we're gonna
[5:39] help her by putting her in a watery icy
[5:42] cold grave but when she comes back she's
[5:45] gonna come back in newness of life so to
[5:47] fulfill the great commission that Jesus
[5:50] told all this disciples to go into all
[5:51] the world preach the gospel baptizing in
[5:53] the name of the Father in the name of
[5:55] the son in the name of the Holy Ghost
[5:58] which were titled not a name but then
[6:02] you go over in the book of Acts Peter
[6:05] says repent and be baptized in the name
[6:09] of Jesus Christ so we're gonna baptize
[6:12] our sister and a wonderful name of the
[6:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[6:20] [Applause]
[6:43] tell are you backing her up give her the
[6:49] assurance that we're gonna be right
[6:50] there with a man darkest hours right now
[7:04] and then when we leave out of here he's
[7:07] really not gonna matter brother right
[7:08] because we're not going to work we're
[7:09] gonna be in glory we're gonna be
[7:12] standing there with brother Eugene
