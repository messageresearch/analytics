[28:08] amen
[28:09] amen there two scriptures we've been
[28:12] reading to try to bring a thought from
[28:16] Hebrews
[28:17] 81 now the things which we have spoken
[28:21] this is the ssal what now seven
[28:25] chapters read it sometime together all
[28:27] together is
[28:29] one and just realized that when Paul
[28:32] gets this far he said now I'm going to
[28:33] try to sum this
[28:35] up he's explaining the great Mel jezdic
[28:38] all of the things of of the great
[28:41] understanding of predestination and all
[28:43] of the things of the word and then he
[28:45] says now this is the sum what is that
[28:48] sum we have such an high priest who is
[28:51] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[28:53] the Majesty in the
[28:57] heavens let's go to
[28:59] Ecclesiastes it's hard to find for you
[29:02] right next to Songs of Solomon and
[29:04] Ecclesiastes
[29:05] 12 verse
[29:07] 13 and after he's concluding all that he
[29:11] said Ecclesiastes called the preacher
[29:14] that's what it's called you know for the
[29:15] Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher now
[29:17] after he's got to preaching all of his
[29:19] sermon and he comes down to the end of
[29:21] it he says now let us hear the
[29:23] conclusion of the whole
[29:25] matter and what is the conclusion of it
[29:28] fear God and keep his Commandments for
[29:31] this is the whole duty of man you may be
[29:35] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[29:38] reading of the word now some that wasn't
[29:41] here may need a copy of
[29:44] that just a few that that didn't have
[29:48] one to just show that the things that
[29:50] were you know to give it to you the
[29:52] scriptures and then that way you can go
[29:53] read your for yourself cuz I like to
[29:55] read the Bible for myself you know I
[29:58] mean hearing somebody else read it and
[29:59] tell me what it says is fine but you
[30:02] know I I like to read myself and uh I
[30:04] like to uh this Ecclesiastes said I like
[30:08] to I like to hear the conclusion of the
[30:12] matter now in the Bible summing up I'll
[30:15] have to give this a tiny bit of a
[30:17] background
[30:18] but there is what would be called the
[30:21] seven compound names of Jehovah all
[30:25] right now in that you'll see that it's
[30:28] Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[30:29] tisu uh you got many uh
[30:34] titles uh Jehovah Shalom Jehovah n n
[30:38] nessi Jehovah Rah Jehovah RFI uh Jehovah
[30:43] Shamar all of those were ways that God
[30:49] was trying to speak to the people or you
[30:54] know of what they the time that they
[30:57] were and then when they would write it
[30:59] down and and put it and and a lot of it
[31:01] it really used like we used this morning
[31:04] uh there in in Genesis 22 where we use
[31:08] the for Jehovah Gyra and that's where
[31:11] that when Abraham was to take his son
[31:15] Isaac up on the mountain you know and to
[31:18] actually to kill him and uh he was well
[31:21] intended to do it cuz he was headed that
[31:24] away but God stepped on the scene and
[31:27] like we we know the story of why how
[31:30] would that uh lamb that you know when
[31:33] when God spoke to Abraham and told him
[31:36] to hold his hand not kill his son he
[31:39] turned around and looked and he found a
[31:40] lamb well where did that lamb come from
[31:43] because as the prophet has explained it
[31:45] to us back there you know you could walk
[31:47] easily I mean you know 20 M A Day 25 mil
[31:51] a day and they went 3 days journey and
[31:54] then the mountain was way off and they
[31:57] go on up and Abraham's carrying the the
[32:00] fire and carrying the wood and got a
[32:03] knife in his hand and long about that
[32:05] time you know Isaac he begins to to uh
[32:08] he was on up maybe you know 12 13 14
[32:11] years old whatever somewhere and he
[32:13] begin to look around and he said now now
[32:16] daddy where's uh I I see the fire and
[32:19] the you know I see the wood I see the
[32:23] knife but said where's the where's the
[32:26] sacrifice that we're going up here to
[32:29] offer and God looks Abraham looks back
[32:32] at him and he says now son said God will
[32:36] provide himself a
[32:38] sacrifice well he was speaking from a
[32:41] prophetic form because he was actually
[32:43] looking at what he was going to
[32:44] sacrifice right he was literally going
[32:47] to kill his own son because God spoke to
[32:49] him told him to do it because you know
[32:52] like I said this morning uh God may not
[32:54] never ask you to kill one of your
[32:56] children because that kind of in this
[32:58] day they'd kind of get you for uh things
[33:01] but uh you know back then it was a
[33:03] little different style of ways but you
[33:05] know maybe sometimes he ask you to do
[33:07] something that is
[33:09] strange um maybe he asked you to run
[33:12] over to Lula church as afternoon and sit
[33:14] down and listen you know might be a
[33:17] little different thing for you want you
[33:18] to do and uh that's just a way of saying
[33:22] it but it it happens that way and uh but
[33:26] anyhow when he got ready to kill him he
[33:29] turned around and God spoke to him and
[33:31] there was the lamb where'd it come
[33:34] from you know back there on the mountain
[33:37] how would a lamb survive back on the
[33:39] mountain when the animals were to guide
[33:41] him you know and everything but God
[33:44] created a a sacrifice to take the place
[33:48] of what Abraham was fixing to do see the
[33:53] Lord provided a sacrifice all right so
[33:55] then providing that sacrifice when Mo
[33:58] when um the writing came through on it
[34:02] it was declared that Abraham said this
[34:05] is a place that I'll call it Jehovah
[34:09] Gyra say because the Lord has
[34:12] provided a
[34:14] sacrifice all right now as I was trying
[34:17] to bring this morning see then Jehovah
[34:21] Gyra being the Lord's provided
[34:24] sacrifice then if that was true that he
[34:28] is our
[34:29] sacrifice and we believe that God that
[34:32] was just a speaking of the coming of
[34:34] Jesus Christ all right and you know all
[34:38] of the things back there the offerings
[34:40] the signs the things that happen only
[34:42] spoke of Calvary coming because we know
[34:45] who the real true sacrifice is right see
[34:48] it's not a a lamb today it's it's not a
[34:52] a goat or a Ram or a red heer or
[34:55] something like that you know it's
[34:58] the Lord Jesus Christ was our
[35:00] sacrifice if not we're in bad shape you
[35:03] know we've got to believe that he paid
[35:06] the
[35:07] price he took our
[35:09] place only thing he asked of us to do is
[35:13] just to take his place then upon the
[35:15] Earth and be what we're supposed to be
[35:18] as Christians to let the world see
[35:21] Christ Living in our lives you know and
[35:24] see Jehovah Gyra then who was the the
[35:27] one see when God came down himself
[35:30] because we believe in one true and
[35:32] living God not as we you know had been
[35:35] been taught of all of our Lives maybe a
[35:37] lot of things about the godhead but I
[35:39] believe in one true and living God and
[35:42] like Jesus said unless you believe that
[35:44] I am he you will die in your sins well
[35:47] we know for sure that he died for our
[35:50] sins right we know for sure that Jesus
[35:54] Christ hung on the cross and died for
[35:56] our sins well it wouldn't be just for
[35:59] you to send one of your children down to
[36:02] die for something that you're supposed
[36:03] to die for so we don't believe that that
[36:06] there was another person somewhere else
[36:08] that sent another person you know to do
[36:10] something else God came
[36:13] himself because that's what he told to
[36:15] Abraham that God Abraham said to Isaac
[36:19] God will provide for
[36:21] himself and he did 2,000 years ago he
[36:26] provided himself a sacrifice right to
[36:29] hang up on a tree to be able to pay the
[36:32] sin debt for you and I and thank God for
[36:35] that
[36:36] sacrifice you know because if heam made
[36:39] the sacrifice where would you and I be
[36:40] we'd still be in our sin that's the
[36:42] that's the only point he had to pay a
[36:45] price because there was a
[36:49] penalty because we had sinned and fallen
[36:52] short of the glory of God and and by
[36:55] doing that then a py had to be made or a
[37:00] price had to be paid see and God came
[37:04] down himself back there 2,000 years ago
[37:06] and and died upon a tree it was not the
[37:11] the beating that killed him it was not
[37:14] the the uh Stripes you know doing and
[37:17] all that was for our
[37:19] healing it was not that because when
[37:22] they pierced his side they come to find
[37:25] that water and blood said come
[37:28] out signifying that he died of a broken
[37:31] heart right you know
[37:34] why because mankind rejected him that's
[37:38] what he died of he died in mine in your
[37:41] place it was my sins that put him on the
[37:44] cross it was your sins that put him on
[37:45] the cross and he died of a broken heart
[37:48] because no one would accept
[37:50] him he kept telling them L you believe
[37:53] that I'm he you'll die in your sins but
[37:55] they wouldn't believe it me what do we
[37:58] believe today that's what I was asking
[37:59] you at the end of the service this
[38:01] morning who is your Sac sacrifice right
[38:05] who is the one that took your place cuz
[38:08] someone has
[38:10] to we can't die for ourselves that's
[38:13] right and as I said we've had good
[38:15] people that come along and give their
[38:17] life for other people you know fall on a
[38:19] hand grenade and and save a company or
[38:22] save men around them to take the whole
[38:24] BL but you know that didn't save us all
[38:27] that's it preserved some bodies maybe
[38:31] but it didn't save a
[38:33] soul so we got to depend upon our
[38:36] sacrifice amen and our sacrifice has to
[38:39] be that God gave himself right to take
[38:44] our place you say well I don't
[38:46] understand that because you know how can
[38:49] God die well it's very simple if you
[38:52] just think simple I guess that's why God
[38:55] made me the way I am he gave me a simple
[38:58] mind that just think simple and I think
[39:02] slow and I talk
[39:04] slow and uh you know but see you think
[39:08] things out
[39:09] Simply if Jesus said unless you believe
[39:12] that I am he is that scripture you'll
[39:14] die in your sin who's he talking about
[39:16] the Bible said it was God Emmanuel you
[39:19] know Emmanuel God With Us who was that
[39:24] sacrifice you say well it was the second
[39:27] person
[39:28] now that we're enough educated though
[39:30] that we know better than to think about
[39:33] things in the wrong order and I know
[39:35] these are you
[39:37] know it's it's things that we should
[39:41] consider but see God Almighty died on
[39:45] that tree that's right you said God
[39:47] can't die no not the way we think about
[39:50] it that's right because as I just got to
[39:54] explaining it it wasn't the the beatings
[39:57] that it wasn't the the nail Prince that
[39:59] killed
[40:00] him he gave his own life but he'd
[40:03] already told
[40:05] him he said you can't take my life read
[40:08] your scripture Matthew Martin luk John
[40:10] he said I lay it
[40:14] down you can't you couldn't take it it
[40:16] was no way to do it that's right he said
[40:19] I'll lay down my life amen he said but
[40:21] I'll raise it again all right see then
[40:25] what he done what is death as we say you
[40:29] know I know I'm carnal but I like to get
[40:31] this point across we say what is death
[40:33] you say well death is when when you just
[40:35] lay down and die and they take you to
[40:36] the Undertaker you know and they pick
[40:38] you up as pretty as they can and they
[40:40] walk over and you look down in there and
[40:42] said oh ain't he pretty no he's
[40:44] dead that's not a joke it's true he's
[40:47] dead life has left the body they've been
[40:49] bombed it but we call that death that's
[40:52] not
[40:53] death because the Bible says that no man
[40:56] you you can't can't take your own life
[40:58] you can take the existence of life away
[41:01] from you that's right but you can't do
[41:03] nothing it's God that has to take the
[41:06] soul away that's right amen you can be
[41:08] blown to pieces of all kind of thing but
[41:11] if there's anything left there you can
[41:13] still be
[41:15] alive see God is the only one that can
[41:17] take your life right Satan can't you say
[41:21] Satan kills people no Satan don't kill
[41:23] people cuz he can't do it that's right
[41:25] he don't have the power to amen
[41:27] God has to allow the life to leave the
[41:30] body so what happened to
[41:33] Calvary very
[41:36] simple very simple to understand one
[41:38] true and living God that's right that
[41:42] there a baby was born 2,000 years ago
[41:45] and what happened what happens when a
[41:47] natural baby is
[41:49] born a natural baby is born what he do
[41:53] when the baby comes
[41:55] forth God gives it a
[41:58] spirit right and he gives it a soul
[42:02] right to where it can
[42:04] live that was simply what God done he
[42:07] just came right down Hebrews 10:5 a body
[42:10] thou H has prepared me he just came down
[42:12] through the Virgin
[42:14] birth and when that body was come forth
[42:17] from the wound of Mary he just stepped
[42:19] right into it amen the very soul and the
[42:23] Very Spirit of almighty God doing that
[42:25] making God in human flesh
[42:28] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[42:30] word is with God and the Word was God
[42:32] verse 14 says and the Word was made
[42:35] flesh and dwell among us and we beheld
[42:37] it as only begotten of the father you
[42:40] all right so what happened at
[42:44] Calvary he said into thy hands right I
[42:48] commend my spirit right God just simply
[42:52] stepped out of that
[42:55] body and left him hanging there that's
[42:58] right so God died in the bases that for
[43:01] you and I right all right they put the
[43:04] body in the grave the Bible says the
[43:06] spirit went to speak to the soul their
[43:09] spirit's in
[43:10] prison and then he come back up in 3
[43:12] days picked that body up took it up made
[43:16] it in a glorified state right turned
[43:19] around in just a little bit the Holy
[43:20] Ghost came back down right to live in
[43:23] the hearts of the people
[43:24] amen now that's not hard to understand
[43:27] then how the life could leave the body
[43:30] and things could happen and that God
[43:33] could die in our
[43:35] place and that would make him then as I
[43:37] was trying to bring out that would make
[43:39] him then what happened to
[43:43] Abraham Jehovah
[43:45] Gyra the Lord will provide a sacrifice
[43:51] amen all right now that's just
[43:54] background
[43:55] material but tried to get you to look at
[43:58] it in the respect that many of you have
[44:01] spoken to me about it and said before I
[44:04] started this kind of a series on it that
[44:07] you hadn't looked at it like I was
[44:08] trying to bring it out well I that's
[44:11] good you say well I believe in one God
[44:15] okay now listen to me please you say I
[44:19] believe in one God brother Dale well
[44:21] that's
[44:24] true but when you admit that you don't
[44:27] see things in the clearest respect it
[44:31] doesn't mean that you don't believe in
[44:32] one
[44:33] God it don't mean that you're not right
[44:36] you know it doesn't mean that it means
[44:39] your lack of understanding right your
[44:42] lack of Revelation from God all right so
[44:45] that's the human element right all right
[44:48] so then what have I been trying to
[44:51] say that if there is an all there's a
[44:54] lot more of the thing things that are
[44:57] called Redemptive
[44:59] names than just the ones I gave you but
[45:03] all that is summed up in everything that
[45:07] God is and has been or ever will be is
[45:10] summed up into these
[45:12] seven Redemptive names which would be
[45:15] you know Jehovah Gyra see the Lord's
[45:18] provided sacrifice Jehovah T you and I'm
[45:21] a bad pronouncer but it means the Lord
[45:25] our righteousness
[45:28] Jehovah Shalom which means what our
[45:32] peace every time God would step into the
[45:35] presence of man what does he say peace
[45:38] because he knows the the supernatural
[45:40] Jehovah Nasha which means our Banner you
[45:44] remember when the children of Israel
[45:45] went forth each group had a
[45:49] banner for their tribe and then they
[45:52] would
[45:53] like four of them get together and
[45:57] they'd have a banner that they had to
[45:59] follow so we'll get down to those things
[46:02] and then it's Jehovah Rah which is the
[46:05] Lord is my
[46:06] shepherd you know Psalms
[46:08] 23 Jehovah rapi which is the
[46:14] Healer and then Jehovah shama which
[46:18] means the Lord is
[46:19] present so you sum up everything about
[46:22] God into these seven ways or
[46:28] expressions and as I said now remember
[46:31] it was the way God was appearing to the
[46:37] people he would appear as I said to
[46:40] Jehovah Gyra to Abraham why because he
[46:43] needed a
[46:44] sacrifice now while he was up on the
[46:47] mountain and what he was doing he didn't
[46:48] need a need a
[46:52] Healer so he wasn't appearing as that in
[46:55] that form
[46:58] but the point I want you to
[47:02] see is that and it'll take us quite a
[47:04] while to finish these
[47:08] that all of that sums up into one
[47:12] person almighty
[47:15] God God has
[47:17] always wanted to reveal himself to man
[47:20] that was his purpose for creating us
[47:23] right he created us where he could come
[47:26] down and fellowship with us
[47:29] amen he'd come down in the cool of the
[47:31] day and the scripture there Adam and Eve
[47:34] you know in the garden he could talk to
[47:36] them he could fellowship with them
[47:38] that's right right we see one day then
[47:40] sin entered the picture and When sin
[47:43] entered the
[47:45] picture and they were cast out of the
[47:49] garden what was God going to
[47:53] do you know what he was going to do you
[47:56] already know what he's going to do he's
[47:58] going to make a way amen for that man to
[48:01] be restored back not to just a Garden of
[48:05] Eden cuz who worries about that they
[48:07] claim that's over there somewhere around
[48:11] Iraq but who cares about where his at
[48:14] it's polluted now all messed up you
[48:20] see but God wants to reveal himself to
[48:23] you and I for whatever we have need of
[48:26] right
[48:27] right if you need a Healer today he's
[48:31] wanting to heal you more than you
[48:32] wanting to be healed why because you'll
[48:36] have to admit that in
[48:38] God there was what would be called
[48:41] attributes you know I mean you're
[48:44] looking at me I'm a I'm a human
[48:47] being but I'm also I'm a
[48:50] father I'm a
[48:52] son I I'm I'm a
[48:55] grandfather I'm a grand
[48:57] grandfather you know I'm a pastor of a
[49:00] church former employee of gentle Motors
[49:03] I got many many
[49:05] titles but I'm just one
[49:09] person and and I don't manifest all of
[49:12] them together you know my wife doesn't
[49:15] call me
[49:17] father I mean we do sometimes you know
[49:20] we say daddy or Mom or something you
[49:22] don't want to say it she doesn't have
[49:24] she doesn't really it's not correct for
[49:26] to call me
[49:28] Daddy but it's right for my children to
[49:30] call me
[49:31] that cuz that's the way I'm manifesting
[49:34] myself to my children now to my
[49:37] grandchildren they don't call me Father
[49:40] cuz everybody in our house calls me
[49:42] poppy but oh that's just what it's
[49:45] developed you know even you call me
[49:47] that but see it's something to reveal
[49:51] yourself or to make yourself known and
[49:54] that's the way God's done amen so for
[49:58] 4,000
[49:59] years he dealt with man down through
[50:03] what we call the Old Testament
[50:04] situation and he dealt with them trying
[50:08] to reveal
[50:12] himself that's all he wanted to
[50:15] do just make yourself
[50:18] known now but still he knew even
[50:23] though he would accept the sacrifice
[50:26] that was offered for sin you know that
[50:29] he ordained the animals and things but
[50:31] that still didn't take away sin it only
[50:35] done is the the word for it is called
[50:37] Capo which means it discovered it and
[50:40] that's why Jesus CHR the scripture said
[50:41] he died once for all the all the Old
[50:44] Testament sin was just by that animal
[50:46] being offered it couldn't eradicate that
[50:49] sin and neither could it eradicate the
[50:52] person who was sinning to keep him from
[50:54] wanting to do those things but it was
[50:57] just pushing it covering it pushing it
[51:01] bringing it to Calvary cuz he died once
[51:03] for all as well as the old and the New
[51:05] Testament people right but see then the
[51:09] price once it was
[51:12] paid then the ride of of uh being able
[51:16] to Fellowship again was brought back
[51:19] into
[51:20] mankind but it can only be done by the
[51:22] new birth
[51:25] right we wasn't born wrong that's why
[51:27] Jesus not talking to Nicodemus you
[51:29] remember there in the
[51:31] scripture and he said Nicodemus you must
[51:33] be born again and and the scripture
[51:35] calls Nicodemus in the original
[51:36] translation calls him the teacher of
[51:38] Israel I know Jesus said a teacher but
[51:41] the original translation bring it out
[51:43] says the teacher in other words he was
[51:45] the top teacher of all Israel you know
[51:48] in other words you think today if you
[51:50] try to figure out somebody like Billy
[51:52] Graham or Roberts or something like that
[51:55] or or some great uh person of
[51:58] intellectual abilities you know and
[52:00] you'd call him you're the
[52:04] teacher but when he when he was talking
[52:06] to Nicodemus he said you must be born
[52:08] again very simple
[52:11] language I like what the scripture said
[52:13] said the Common People heard him gladly
[52:15] so he didn't change his language when he
[52:17] started talking you know how people are
[52:20] I'm just plain old country I've been
[52:22] around all over the the United States
[52:24] and I've been in a few foreign countries
[52:26] and things and and they have trouble in
[52:28] the foreign countries translating my
[52:32] speech it's not maybe my words but it's
[52:35] my speech because I still say ha tote
[52:39] and carry you know just like I do here
[52:41] well we understand that you know fetch
[52:45] me that glass well you say that overseas
[52:49] and you say fetch me that GL
[52:53] fetch what are you talking about and
[52:56] this hard to translate that but that's
[52:59] just the way we talk because we're we're
[53:01] common well that's the way Jesus was
[53:04] talking and my point I'm trying to make
[53:07] is this if I'm from here and I go to
[53:09] Canada where they speak real proper I
[53:11] don't change my way
[53:15] speaking you know I try to be more
[53:17] sensible but I don't use there in there
[53:20] in here and because I never could figure
[53:23] it out when you say here and deer that's
[53:25] too close together
[53:28] right you said which one you saying here
[53:31] or
[53:31] dear when we just play it out we say
[53:34] here and
[53:36] deer like I've always say to you you go
[53:38] up North and you they'll laugh at you
[53:40] like everything but you go in and you
[53:42] order a meal and you say I want some
[53:45] maters and
[53:47] ters and they won't never ask you what
[53:50] you're talking about they'll go in the
[53:52] back room laughing their head off at you
[53:54] but they'll go get you maters and ters
[53:56] right but you let one of them come down
[53:58] here and walk in the cafe and and they
[54:01] said what do you need and they said I
[54:02] want some tomatoes and
[54:06] potatoes you said what cuz you don't
[54:09] understand what they're saying now get
[54:11] the point that's all right I make an
[54:13] illustration for one little word see
[54:16] Jesus didn't change his language
[54:21] right Nicodemus was the guy that had the
[54:24] problem y Jesus knew exactly what he's
[54:27] talking about he said unless you're born
[54:30] again amen you must be born again
[54:34] Nicodemus right well what Nicodemus say
[54:37] you mean I got to go back to my mother's
[54:39] wound and be born a second
[54:43] time he said if I speak to you of
[54:46] heavenly things you don't understand
[54:48] it he said I'm not talking to you that
[54:51] I'm telling you you got to be born again
[54:53] in other words Nicodemus you born wrong
[54:56] right
[54:58] no matter what we think of any of us we
[55:00] born wrong right the psalmist said we
[55:03] were born in sin shapen in iniquity went
[55:06] from our mother's wound a
[55:08] liar you look down at a little bitty
[55:11] baby you know two hours old you look at
[55:13] it you say that's a
[55:15] liar well people don't like if you say
[55:18] that about your kids but it's true right
[55:20] you think it ain't true well it's about
[55:21] 2 years
[55:24] old and you say honey where's you get
[55:26] that cookie
[55:28] M got cookie all over his face and both
[55:31] hands and didn't lie to you like
[55:33] everything what that come
[55:36] from certainly didn't come from God and
[55:39] it didn't come from Mom and Daddy cuz
[55:40] they teach her children not to lie true
[55:42] M and daddies huh amen well point is
[55:45] we're born that way and that's what
[55:49] what Jesus was trying to get to
[55:52] Nicodemus you were born wrong right and
[55:55] you got to be born the original
[55:57] translation says You must be born from
[56:02] above where he was born
[56:05] from so then that's the point we have to
[56:08] get we got to hear what he has to say
[56:11] about it then Nicodemus left there
[56:14] unregenerated
[56:16] right because he couldn't understand but
[56:20] on the day of
[56:21] Pentecost those that did understand was
[56:24] in the upper room at Pentecost and they
[56:26] understood what the new birth
[56:29] was they understood what Jesus was
[56:31] saying even though they walked with it
[56:33] for three and a half years the disciples
[56:34] had they still didn't understand him but
[56:37] on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[56:38] fell well now that's the thing today
[56:41] that we need we need that same one that
[56:44] wrote the word to be able to come and
[56:47] interpret the word to us and we can see
[56:49] all of these things is trying is God
[56:53] trying to reveal himself to us
[56:56] ain't that
[56:58] wonderful to think that God Almighty is
[57:02] trying to reveal himself to mankind amen
[57:05] now you can go to school all your life
[57:07] and you'll never learn
[57:09] that cuz they won't teach it to you that
[57:11] way that's right they teach you the
[57:13] great intellectual point I'm not against
[57:15] it I'm just saying that it won't be done
[57:18] by intellect and has to be done by the
[57:21] New Birth the Born Again experience to
[57:23] be able to understand then
[57:26] and what is my point
[57:30] being that you cannot put more emphasis
[57:34] upon Jehovah
[57:38] Gyra if you're going to try to serve
[57:41] God then you would upon Jehovah
[57:45] RI which is our healer right if the
[57:49] Bible says he's our sacrifice
[57:53] yes now why can't we believe he's our
[57:57] healer he said I'm the Lord that Health
[58:01] all of thy diseases you remember how the
[58:03] prophet brought it out one day the had a
[58:05] way of emphasizing things I love he said
[58:08] you want to look into
[58:10] Moses's doctor's kit you know Moses with
[58:13] 2 and A2 million
[58:15] people out in the wilderness for 40
[58:17] years walking
[58:19] around and the Bible said that their
[58:22] shoes growed with them right now that's
[58:25] what your Bible says amen you said well
[58:29] I don't believe that well you don't
[58:30] believe the Bible BL language no problem
[58:33] you just don't believe
[58:34] it but you see their clothes didn't wear
[58:39] out but I don't understand that I don't
[58:41] either but I believe in God that can do
[58:43] it don't you yes amen now but in all of
[58:47] that he said do you want to
[58:50] see Moses little you know what we call
[58:53] the Satchel you know the little doctor's
[58:55] kid you know a little black bag to
[58:58] Satchel do you want to look into Mo to
[59:00] Moses Satchel look down in there and you
[59:03] know what you read I am the Lord that
[59:06] Health all of thy
[59:10] diseases you know it's all Moses
[59:13] needed you remember the snakes even
[59:15] though they got in trouble themselves
[59:17] and caused it but you know the snakes
[59:19] was biting
[59:20] them Moses just went over and formed a
[59:23] little thing and hung it up on a tree
[59:25] and
[59:26] let it look like a
[59:29] snake and he said okay you look at that
[59:33] cuz God told me if you look at that and
[59:34] believe it you'll be
[59:36] healed and that's how they was healed
[59:40] right why because that serpent was not
[59:43] the
[59:44] Healer that serpent represented
[59:48] sin already
[59:52] judged you understand me FL was made a
[59:55] snake look like it would have been made
[59:57] a a cross or a dove or a some kind of
[1:00:02] a Venom to Golden all this the way God
[1:00:06] does
[1:00:07] things but you see if you make one
[1:00:10] greater than the other one look what
[1:00:12] you're
[1:00:13] losing and that's our problem we need
[1:00:17] healing of the
[1:00:20] body there's not a person in here from
[1:00:23] the least baby in here that today that
[1:00:27] does not have something physically wrong
[1:00:29] with
[1:00:31] you I don't care how young you
[1:00:34] are there's something in there eating
[1:00:37] its way at
[1:00:38] you and it come because of
[1:00:41] sin job
[1:00:43] said though my skin
[1:00:47] worms destroy this body he it yet in my
[1:00:51] flesh I'll see God job understood hey
[1:00:55] where is it worms come from if they
[1:00:57] don't involve you in the
[1:01:01] hurry that's right
[1:01:03] right it ain't a bug somewhere else it
[1:01:06] crawls up and bites you and then you
[1:01:09] start rottening and here comes excuse me
[1:01:11] for the plain language but here comes
[1:01:13] the maggots and the things the worms
[1:01:16] that eat you up it's inside your
[1:01:18] body you know we talk about
[1:01:22] cancer you know that they say medically
[1:01:25] speaking
[1:01:26] that everybody has cancer
[1:01:31] cells it's just the fact of your immune
[1:01:34] system will fight that to keep it
[1:01:37] suppressed from being able to come up
[1:01:39] and take you whereas other people get a
[1:01:42] bump a scar a burus or something happens
[1:01:45] and here comes a cancer that's not they
[1:01:48] don't have enough to take it away and
[1:01:50] they say now that's seven times in your
[1:01:53] lifetime you will face a situation
[1:01:57] that means cancer is very
[1:02:00] present well that's what kills people
[1:02:02] see you go down the sisters they go down
[1:02:05] to get a mograph and and they say you're
[1:02:08] cancer free go back in 3 months and they
[1:02:11] find a
[1:02:11] knot see all it means is that there's
[1:02:14] not 800 and something thousand sales
[1:02:17] orever what they call it the great big
[1:02:19] thing it takes that many to show up on
[1:02:22] the Machinery so you already got it
[1:02:25] before you
[1:02:26] all right you understand so we all need
[1:02:28] healing right everybody understand we
[1:02:31] all need healing I don't care how much
[1:02:33] you feel how good you feel I feel mighty
[1:02:35] good for 70 years old I do I feel
[1:02:40] good but you know I
[1:02:42] know that things are eating away at this
[1:02:47] body we see why is it I can't
[1:02:52] believe because I'm making salvation one
[1:02:55] thing
[1:02:59] and I'm making that a confession with my
[1:03:01] mouth and a believing in my heart which
[1:03:03] is correct come on right
[1:03:07] Romans what is it
[1:03:09] 10 the mouth confession is made under
[1:03:11] salvation but you must believe in your
[1:03:13] heart confessing with a mouth won't save
[1:03:15] you that's right you got to confess with
[1:03:17] your mouth believe in your heart right
[1:03:19] you got to put them
[1:03:20] together but you
[1:03:22] see we do that but then when it comes to
[1:03:26] the healing of our bodies what do we say
[1:03:29] the doctor
[1:03:31] said now we goofed up right there hey
[1:03:34] come on folks I go to doctor too so I'm
[1:03:36] not thr off we're not against doctors
[1:03:39] thank God for
[1:03:41] doctors I'm not going to them when they
[1:03:43] won't believe in God being the
[1:03:45] Healer I've walked away from them and
[1:03:47] it's just that's all right that's your
[1:03:50] business but I want to go to one that
[1:03:52] talks about healing and him talking
[1:03:54] about helping me
[1:03:57] cuz if he he's got any sense at all he
[1:03:59] knows he can't heal you I listen to
[1:04:01] Prophet the other day and I thought man
[1:04:03] how in the world could explain something
[1:04:04] that
[1:04:06] wonderful you know you take penicillin
[1:04:09] and stuff you know
[1:04:11] antibiotics you rub it on shores and
[1:04:14] things you know that I listen to him the
[1:04:17] other day and he said it like
[1:04:18] this he said if antibiotics are are are
[1:04:22] penicillin what he was really saying he
[1:04:24] said if that's what heals
[1:04:26] you he said then why don't you look at a
[1:04:29] guy that's got a big cut on his arm and
[1:04:31] he says he
[1:04:33] dies you know and you in bomb
[1:04:39] him and said 3 months later you put
[1:04:43] penicillin where that cut was at said it
[1:04:45] won't heal it right he said well of
[1:04:49] course it w CU he dead you ain't getting
[1:04:51] what he's saying either
[1:04:54] right the penicillin is not healing
[1:04:57] right it takes a creation of cells and
[1:05:01] only God can create
[1:05:04] amen you get a cut put something on it
[1:05:07] clean it keep it clean right that's
[1:05:10] right and God will heal it you break a
[1:05:14] bone the doctor sets it but he can't
[1:05:17] heal that
[1:05:19] bone takes God to be the
[1:05:22] healer but see we put it on that or we
[1:05:24] put it on what the doctor says
[1:05:26] and you better believe for sure cuz you
[1:05:28] know enough about it anyway you're if
[1:05:30] you're 50 years old you know for sure
[1:05:32] all the doctors 90% of them doing trying
[1:05:34] to get you money that's
[1:05:36] right right come on we're honest what I
[1:05:39] said I got doctors I go to her
[1:05:43] sure I tell them hey long as it's not
[1:05:46] contrary to what I
[1:05:47] believe I will do what you say they told
[1:05:52] me I had leukemia I said oky dokie
[1:05:55] that's what you you say I don't believe
[1:05:58] it but I said I'm not taking your
[1:06:02] chemo they didn't like it you know got
[1:06:05] shaky finally one of them he said well
[1:06:07] Sam and he's a good Christian guy and he
[1:06:10] said Sam that's better now it was to be
[1:06:13] I said Doctor you're in the business and
[1:06:15] I'm in the
[1:06:16] business you sat and look at them you
[1:06:19] see them every day they're dying taking
[1:06:22] your chemo I'm in the business of
[1:06:25] burying
[1:06:28] and then I said you know for sure it's
[1:06:29] not doing any
[1:06:30] good he said well Sam I listen I'll do
[1:06:34] anything you say except something
[1:06:35] contrary to what God says right well
[1:06:39] that guy so friendly with me was up at
[1:06:42] the hospital one day he goes all the way
[1:06:44] across the the emergency room thing we
[1:06:46] were in there with somebody else getting
[1:06:48] doing he comes all the way out come out
[1:06:51] hey Sam how you
[1:06:53] doing don't even charge me no feed or
[1:06:56] nothing Lord go in and talk have a good
[1:06:59] time cuz I love good doctors amen but he
[1:07:02] said say I can't heal nobody right I
[1:07:06] said we know that doc you can help us
[1:07:10] you set the bone you sew it up you clean
[1:07:12] it
[1:07:14] up but that penicillin ain't going to do
[1:07:16] it that's right that antibiotics and we
[1:07:19] take them
[1:07:22] right it takes God to heal
[1:07:26] but do we look at it like that God is
[1:07:27] the
[1:07:28] Healer now what am I getting at one
[1:07:34] thing we put the basis of our Salvation
[1:07:37] upon the confession of our mouth and the
[1:07:40] believing in our heart we don't put it
[1:07:42] upon no man
[1:07:45] right we don't put it on what anybody
[1:07:48] else says
[1:07:50] right now you can say you know what I'm
[1:07:52] talking about cuz the Bible said no man
[1:07:54] can call Jesus the Christ accepted me by
[1:07:56] the holy ghost that scripture all right
[1:07:59] but if I'm just saying what the sister
[1:08:01] said I'm saying what the brother said
[1:08:03] that has nothing to do with it that's
[1:08:05] right I must say what God
[1:08:08] says God says I'm Healed God say I'm
[1:08:12] saved let me say what he
[1:08:15] says
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] amen well we'll see when they put you
[1:08:20] down to the Undertaker well don't worry
[1:08:22] about it I've got an upper taker done
[1:08:24] care of that
[1:08:29] see that's one thing don't bother me you
[1:08:31] may be afraid of it but that don't
[1:08:32] bother me that has nothing to do that's
[1:08:36] right I've had a 30 out 6 go off that
[1:08:38] close to my head and
[1:08:40] splatter
[1:08:43] barking and led into my head and I just
[1:08:47] climbed up in the tree and went on
[1:08:50] Hunting had a deer stand to fall out
[1:08:52] about 20 something feet up
[1:08:55] as I was going it kept slipping I
[1:08:57] realized it was falling and I just
[1:08:59] throwed my gun in the honey sucle patch
[1:09:01] down below me cuz I didn't want to go
[1:09:02] down with it and when I did I just big
[1:09:05] enough I just reached out like that and
[1:09:06] grabbed a limb I just swung around the
[1:09:10] tree walked right down this looked like
[1:09:12] i' done it
[1:09:14] purposely walked down picked up my gun
[1:09:16] and said you go home no went down found
[1:09:18] me another deer stand crawled up on it
[1:09:20] sat down finish the
[1:09:21] day why because the fear is not there
[1:09:26] fear have
[1:09:27] torment you afraid of something that's
[1:09:29] what's going to get you you afraid of
[1:09:32] cancer doctor will tell you doctor will
[1:09:34] tell you to hurry if you're afraid of a
[1:09:36] sickness it's going to get you that's
[1:09:38] right amen don't be afraid of it Bluff
[1:09:40] it nothing else stand up against it
[1:09:44] would you
[1:09:45] see Jehovah
[1:09:48] rapi I am the Lord that Health thy
[1:09:52] diseases let's look at that one cuz
[1:09:54] we're hung right there I guess
[1:09:57] Jehovah RI Exodus
[1:10:01] 15 remember now what I'm
[1:10:03] saying the point I'm getting across all
[1:10:05] of these are Old
[1:10:07] Testament
[1:10:09] scriptures and in the Old Testament God
[1:10:12] was appearing to mankind right to show
[1:10:16] mankind what was needed for the time do
[1:10:19] you
[1:10:21] understand so he I said he didn't show
[1:10:26] Abraham on the mountain Jehovah J
[1:10:29] Jehovah
[1:10:31] rapi why he didn't need a Healer he
[1:10:34] needed a sacrifice right so he showed
[1:10:38] him a
[1:10:39] sacrifice Moses down in in the the the
[1:10:42] Journey coming
[1:10:44] out he had a deliverer that had done
[1:10:47] brought him out of Egypt right he had a
[1:10:50] sacrifice already made he had the
[1:10:53] atonements in the things
[1:10:55] but he needed a healer look at Exodus
[1:11:08] 15:26 look at 25 now this is Moses and
[1:11:11] what he's doing he's asking him what to
[1:11:14] drink and the things you know the bitter
[1:11:16] water and he cried unto the Lord and the
[1:11:19] Lord showed him showed him a tree which
[1:11:21] when he had cast into the waters the
[1:11:23] waters were made sweet
[1:11:26] there he made for them a statute and an
[1:11:28] ordinance and there he proved
[1:11:31] them and he said if thou Wilt G
[1:11:35] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[1:11:38] Lord thy God and Willl do that which is
[1:11:40] right in his sight and will give ear to
[1:11:43] his Commandments and keep all of his
[1:11:46] statutes now watch him if you do these
[1:11:50] things each one of those are involved
[1:11:52] with the Jehovah Banner Jehovah with tiu
[1:11:56] Jehovah see there each one involved in
[1:11:58] it that's why I ask you if you would I'm
[1:12:01] asking you to do it over and over is
[1:12:03] read the 23rd
[1:12:06] psalm just read it over and over and
[1:12:09] over you'll find all the Redemptive
[1:12:12] names of God dealing in in Psalms 23 the
[1:12:16] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[1:12:18] maketh me the light down Le go on read
[1:12:21] it
[1:12:23] watch and we'll do which is right in his
[1:12:26] sight and will give ear to his
[1:12:28] Commandments and keep all his statutes I
[1:12:30] will put none of these diseases upon
[1:12:34] thee which I have brought upon the
[1:12:38] Egyptians for I am the
[1:12:41] Lord that Health
[1:12:44] thee now from that is derived because of
[1:12:47] the interpretation of what it's saying
[1:12:50] there is derived the meaning of Jehovah
[1:12:58] rapi the Lord that Health all of thy
[1:13:03] diseases it's not written out there in
[1:13:05] language a lot of these are written in
[1:13:07] plain language but it's just showing you
[1:13:10] in Psalms it said the Lord is my
[1:13:11] shepherd all right that's one of the
[1:13:13] meanings of the word Jehovah uh what is
[1:13:16] it Jehovah uh Ray it means the Lord is
[1:13:19] Our
[1:13:20] Shepherd it's whatever is needed for the
[1:13:23] time what did Moses this need with the
[1:13:26] children of Israel 2 and a half million
[1:13:27] they didn't have doctors and nurses and
[1:13:30] hospitals
[1:13:31] and but they had a man that had contact
[1:13:34] with
[1:13:36] God and when they needed
[1:13:38] healing they could go to that
[1:13:41] man didn't make that man anything did
[1:13:45] it made God a great
[1:13:48] God that would have a Healer
[1:13:52] there and would be the Lord that would
[1:13:54] Health all thy
[1:13:58] diseases that would take place and they
[1:14:01] could pull from that as we take all of
[1:14:03] the examples as it was saying to where
[1:14:05] that they would build a a a snake and
[1:14:08] stick it up and God would honor
[1:14:10] that we're like we're reading here that
[1:14:13] they couldn't drink the water so he
[1:14:15] tells Moses just take a stick down and
[1:14:17] throw it into the
[1:14:20] water now if Moses would have said I
[1:14:22] tell you what now Lord It's a Long ways
[1:14:25] over under on that side that Hill get
[1:14:27] that stick and it's hot so I'll just
[1:14:30] throw a
[1:14:32] rock now that's kind of the way we talk
[1:14:35] right Lord you take what I got or leave
[1:14:38] it wasn't that what Cain said in the
[1:14:41] garden Lord I've done all I'm going to
[1:14:43] do you either take what I given to you
[1:14:45] or forget it you know what happened God
[1:14:46] forgot it right gave honor to abble and
[1:14:50] wouldn't have
[1:14:51] came like the prophet was saying one day
[1:14:54] about Moses when he was there in you
[1:14:56] know the uh at the burning bush and God
[1:14:59] said take off your
[1:15:01] shoes he
[1:15:03] said Lord that dirt and sand is hot I
[1:15:08] just take my hat
[1:15:10] off he said God had never spoke to him
[1:15:14] right why cuz he told him what to do
[1:15:17] that's right God tells you what to do
[1:15:18] you do what he said it don't make no
[1:15:20] difference that's
[1:15:22] right if he tells you to do it you do
[1:15:24] what he said don't try to figure it out
[1:15:26] now this is a better way now
[1:15:32] Lord that doctor told me when I went
[1:15:34] that time for about my kneecaps and
[1:15:37] things and the doctor proved the x-rays
[1:15:39] and all the things he said Sam I'm just
[1:15:41] going to have to take your kneecaps off
[1:15:43] one of these days that was before the
[1:15:45] day came of what they've done to my wife
[1:15:46] you know to do the complete knee surgery
[1:15:48] and put you in a brand new knee and
[1:15:51] everything you know I still ain't found
[1:15:54] that grease fitting they can pump any
[1:15:55] grease and where her legs would work
[1:15:57] okay they don't make them but you know
[1:16:02] but that the doctor he said I'll take
[1:16:03] your kneecaps off I looked at him and I
[1:16:05] laughed at
[1:16:06] him and this was a specialist not just a
[1:16:09] regular MD he was a a what do you call a
[1:16:13] a bone doctor and uh or was it
[1:16:15] Orthopedic that what it is you he was a
[1:16:18] specialist and he was an Old Gentleman
[1:16:20] sensibly nice talking guy you know and I
[1:16:22] liked him but he said I'll take your
[1:16:24] knec I said you won't never take my
[1:16:26] kneecaps on he just lied
[1:16:29] back he said I done showed you they were
[1:16:33] out I said I don't care what you say you
[1:16:37] ain't taking my kneecaps
[1:16:39] off well I walked out of the office you
[1:16:42] know I'm still hbling I go back you've
[1:16:45] heard me tell it I'll go back to my
[1:16:46] regular MD and he said Sam my guy's a
[1:16:50] specialist I said I don't care what he
[1:16:52] is he ain't taking my C
[1:16:57] off I said you get me off of my feet for
[1:16:59] 3 days and I'll prove it to you he said
[1:17:02] I ain't going to do it I'll give you two
[1:17:03] he said because he says you got crippin
[1:17:06] arthritis he said if you got it you sat
[1:17:08] down you know it's true he was right he
[1:17:10] said if you sit down you lock up won't
[1:17:12] never move I said Doctor all I got is
[1:17:14] irritated kneecaps get me off of my feet
[1:17:18] you know instead of having to go to J
[1:17:19] Motors man you walking on that concrete
[1:17:22] and do
[1:17:23] it I took two days off you know what I
[1:17:26] done I went back to G motor you know
[1:17:27] what I still got my
[1:17:29] KN I spent about 30 something years ago
[1:17:32] close to 40 again praise the Lord you
[1:17:34] know I guess that doctor he probably
[1:17:35] ain't practicing now I wish I know for
[1:17:37] sure you know I'd go back and head and
[1:17:39] say Doc I still got my knap so I was
[1:17:42] depending upon what God was
[1:17:46] saying it's fine to have your confidence
[1:17:49] in doctors if you don't there's no need
[1:17:51] to going to them
[1:17:56] yeah but the thing of it was I was
[1:17:59] depending upon what Moses
[1:18:01] said Moses said God what I need God
[1:18:05] said I'm the Lord that Health all of thy
[1:18:08] diseases 40
[1:18:12] years and their clothes growed with them
[1:18:15] now you say I just can't understand it
[1:18:18] okay you're done
[1:18:20] believe blessing I don't mean to be nce
[1:18:24] to or hateful tell the truth truth is
[1:18:26] better
[1:18:28] understood you don't believe that that
[1:18:31] the Red Sea opened up you believe that
[1:18:33] they walked across on this sea of Ridge
[1:18:35] well then explain how pharaoh and his
[1:18:37] army got grounded in two Ines of water
[1:18:39] right right right that's what they say
[1:18:42] they say they just went up to a place
[1:18:44] and went across the sea a re and just
[1:18:46] drove across one my Bible says Pharaoh
[1:18:48] Army got drowned you making it a greater
[1:18:52] Miracle than it is if you leave it alone
[1:18:56] you let God wall it up you go
[1:19:01] across when you facing death or
[1:19:04] whatever remember it's God that we're
[1:19:06] dealing with not man
[1:19:10] righten the doctor says like the you've
[1:19:13] heard the prophet tell about which was
[1:19:14] FF Bosworth's daughter son I think now
[1:19:18] but anyhow he said about how that lady
[1:19:21] told him said he never anybody that a
[1:19:24] doctor inst went that low you know when
[1:19:26] your blood pressures and and they raised
[1:19:28] up and he said honey you're looking at

[1:19:33] looking at the promises of
[1:19:35] God and the baby walk come out of

[1:22:39] there was my little
[1:22:44] nephew his lungs was filling up it's
[1:22:47] whatever the disease what is sisters
[1:22:49] fibrosis is that the word for his lungs
[1:22:52] you fell up from they fell up from the
[1:22:53] inside that's the reason the problem
[1:22:55] they fill up from the inside and there's
[1:22:57] no way to get it out or
[1:22:59] nothing and they're laid and they was
[1:23:01] expecting him to die under oxygen tent
[1:23:04] not just oxygen we just simply prayed a
[1:23:06] prayor and you know what he said here a
[1:23:09] while

[1:23:14] said Old Charlotte is that right said
[1:23:17] Sam prayed for me and God touched
[1:23:21] me those lungs filled up yes and they

[1:23:27] that one of those lungs was a solid
[1:23:30] Mass you had Liv many years off of a one
[1:23:33] and not supposed to live over 21 I think
[1:23:35] was right now he's 40 years old what is
[1:23:37] it what am I talking
[1:23:39] about God is the
[1:23:43] Healer if we believe it that's right but
[1:23:46] we're not putting it on the same basis
[1:23:48] as a
[1:23:51] Salvation why not
[1:23:54] as I said this morning I keep saying it
[1:23:58] that I said it today you beat him to
[1:24:00] pieces that would not have healed us you
[1:24:04] see yeah but the Bible say by Stripes
[1:24:05] I'm Healed there is no healing without
[1:24:08] the
[1:24:10] Salvation you can't preach salvation
[1:24:13] without preaching healing you can't
[1:24:14] preach healing without preaching
[1:24:21] salvation cuz he said I'm the Lord that
[1:24:23] Health all the th
[1:24:26] diseases but do we believe it that
[1:24:31] way something goes wrong what's the
[1:24:33] first thing I'll go see what the doctor
[1:24:34] say well all
[1:24:36] right then you find the
[1:24:38] quotes you know that's what we like to
[1:24:40] do we trying to prop up our unbelief
[1:24:43] quotes you find a quote where the
[1:24:45] Prophet said the first Duty you have is
[1:24:46] to go to doctor that's what your Prophet
[1:24:49] said and I believe it go to the doctor
[1:24:51] no
[1:24:52] problems that's why I love
[1:24:55] I love for you to go to the doctor the
[1:24:57] doctor says you got
[1:24:59] this and then you pray for it and you
[1:25:02] don't got it no
[1:25:03] more now what
[1:25:06] happened I I for that doctor to say you
[1:25:09] got so and
[1:25:11] so and then when you believe it and see
[1:25:14] that you're
[1:25:15] healed it's
[1:25:17] wonderful because you're making him
[1:25:20] testify
[1:25:21] yes I am the Lord that Health all of thy
[1:25:26] diseases Moses take these two and two
[1:25:29] and a half million people you take them
[1:25:32] and you lead them 40 years
[1:25:35] yes at the end of 40 years they're still
[1:25:37] wearing the same
[1:25:42] clothes none of you wouldn't raised like
[1:25:45] most of us was
[1:25:47] raised I had three brothers ahead of
[1:25:51] me hand me down from Brother one the
[1:25:54] brother two the brother three and
[1:25:55] brother four my patches had patches on
[1:25:58] the
[1:25:59] patches but I was glad to have them I at
[1:26:02] least covered
[1:26:05] up they took my daddy's shoes and the
[1:26:08] old orange lash and and cut off the shoe
[1:26:11] and nailed it back together and made my
[1:26:13] brother the oldest one a pair of shoes
[1:26:15] all he had was a big old
[1:26:17] heel my sisters get mad CA in school and
[1:26:20] hear them come down the
[1:26:21] hall cuz all he's walking on with he but
[1:26:24] you don't what we made
[1:26:26] it you
[1:26:29] know I mean my mother raised nine of us
[1:26:33] my dad died when I was five and she
[1:26:35] raised us and you know what she wouldn't
[1:26:39] have no weire
[1:26:43] check I was working and already
[1:26:46] married before I could ever talked my
[1:26:49] mother into realizing that there was
[1:26:51] nine of us plus the husband wife situ
[1:26:54] situation 18 of us working paying the
[1:26:57] government and I said mom look at it
[1:27:00] it's not a disgrace for you to go down
[1:27:01] there and take what they're giving you
[1:27:03] we paying for it and you know what she
[1:27:05] finally
[1:27:07] did but you know she wouldn't do it when
[1:27:09] we was coming
[1:27:10] up cuz that was a
[1:27:14] disgrace but you know what she evidently
[1:27:17] done pretty good
[1:27:19] because they's still seven out of nine
[1:27:22] living and I'm the baby
[1:27:25] so it means that a lot of them older
[1:27:26] than I am but you know they're still
[1:27:29] kicking and she raised all of us why
[1:27:33] because she believed God to take care of
[1:27:39] us but listen folks I'm just trying to
[1:27:42] get the point across we'll end
[1:27:43] it see we believe one thing is greater
[1:27:46] than the
[1:27:49] other you're talking about almighty God
[1:27:52] you're not talking about human fire and
[1:27:55] presidents vice presidents and and CEOs
[1:27:58] and and you ain't talking about junk
[1:28:02] that's
[1:28:03] right you're talking about almighty
[1:28:08] God if he can save you why couldn't he
[1:28:11] heal you
[1:28:14] right but do you believe it that
[1:28:16] way well I asked the doctor now see you
[1:28:18] done messed up you didn't ask a real
[1:28:21] doctor real doctor and Isaiah 53 said by
[1:28:25] CH I'm
[1:28:32] Healed 12 or 13 years old I had romatic
[1:28:37] fever that's supposed to be a heart
[1:28:39] conditioned with the blood in the
[1:28:40] situation I can remember when I was out
[1:28:43] of school and all swelled up and all
[1:28:44] kind of thing but you know my mom and
[1:28:46] somebody got to praying for me and you
[1:28:49] know what they can't find it today
[1:28:55] I used to have to take 9 500 MGR of
[1:29:00] antibiotics to be able to get my teeth
[1:29:05] cleaned I took six of them before I went
[1:29:08] to the doctor and three of them when I
[1:29:10] got home to just get my teeth
[1:29:13] cleaned and I told that doctor that
[1:29:15] dentist one day I said man this is crazy
[1:29:18] who was taking care of me that's what I
[1:29:20] told him I said who was taking care of
[1:29:22] me before you and the doctor found out I
[1:29:24] had
[1:29:25] problems right he said I'm going to get
[1:29:29] on the
[1:29:30] phone he got on the phone sit right
[1:29:32] there with me called the doctor that I
[1:29:34] went to and he said Doctor do we need to
[1:29:37] give him these
[1:29:39] antibiotics he
[1:29:41] said that's Sam ain't it said
[1:29:45] yeah he said forget it you don't have to
[1:29:49] take no
[1:29:51] more he said cuz I got his records here
[1:29:53] and we can't can't find a thing they
[1:29:55] can't they can't they can't find nothing
[1:29:57] about rheumatic fever in my
[1:29:59] body why because he's a god it
[1:30:03] health do we believe
[1:30:06] it but see we try to figure it
[1:30:11] out that sister Trudy was telling me
[1:30:14] just a simple point a while ago remember
[1:30:16] last Sunday we baptized little
[1:30:18] n well she was praying Lord if if that's
[1:30:22] you dealing with her to get baptized
[1:30:24] you let her ask me
[1:30:26] again she jumped right up in the seat
[1:30:29] said Mama are we
[1:30:31] going and I want to get
[1:30:34] baptized she said that quick he answered
[1:30:36] her prayer amen well why can't we
[1:30:39] believe it see we try to figure it
[1:30:43] out don't try to figure God out believe
[1:30:46] what he
[1:30:50] says well in a way he's a Healer no he's
[1:30:52] not in a Healer in a way but I can't
[1:30:55] understand our human doing mine yours
[1:30:56] all of us if he can save me why can't he
[1:31:00] heal me now I believe the rest of it you
[1:31:03] know the story I don't believe in
[1:31:05] getting another body I know that's
[1:31:07] taught in the denominations and things
[1:31:10] that we're going to get a new body well
[1:31:11] what do you need a new body for when I
[1:31:13] can prove to you in the Bible that Jesus
[1:31:15] had nail prints in his hands after his
[1:31:18] resurrection you said well we're going
[1:31:20] to have to get us a new body you know
[1:31:21] why because you don't believe God can
[1:31:23] redeem this one
[1:31:26] now if he created why would he have
[1:31:28] trouble healing it and if he healing why
[1:31:32] would he have trouble changing it one
[1:31:34] day cuz my Bible said we' be changed in
[1:31:36] a moment the twinkling of an
[1:31:41] eye why can't we believe what he's
[1:31:44] already
[1:31:46] said what do you want him to do get up
[1:31:48] the cross and die
[1:31:51] again
[1:31:52] no
[1:31:54] Nicodemus why can't you believe
[1:32:00] it because he didn't have the believer
[1:32:03] inside come on let's stand
[1:32:08] together if he's Jehovah Gyra he's
[1:32:11] Jehovah
[1:32:13] RI if he's Jehovah
[1:32:16] RI he's Jehovah re he's Jehovah tishin
[1:32:22] you he's all of
[1:32:26] those
[1:32:28] titles his name is Jesus he's a rose of

[1:32:33] in scripture he's the alpha the Omega
[1:32:36] the beginning and the end he's all and
[1:32:38] everything but what's his
