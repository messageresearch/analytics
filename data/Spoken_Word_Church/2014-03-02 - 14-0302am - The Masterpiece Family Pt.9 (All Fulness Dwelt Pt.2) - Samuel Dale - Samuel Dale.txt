we thank you in Jesus name sah she's are you going to have the operation quick or what do you don't know she's had trouble with gall stones and and everything we're praying about that so she's doing pretty good she's here this morning but you know that's uh you know uh those things she was telling some things that caused you to have them with this that or the other I thought I said I always thought DOL Stone was because you eat rocks and dirt you know I thought that was because that's what we done you know but as kids but so just remember her she'll be knowing Monday what she's going to have the operation or not okay Colossians one we'll start with verse 15 you know the story behind it 13 we're in the Kingdom of his dear son uh Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins and he says who is the image of the invisible God the first born of ever creature now watch what my point watch we start with learning about him and then learning about you know the sons in the kingdom and then now we're going to him and now watch it in whom is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of ever creature where by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body of the church which is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that he that in all things he might have the preeminence amen for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell all right amen now in him now then verse go over to verse eight as we're doing he's not got it dark but beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit in other words after the tradition of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ somebody deceive You by not believing the word says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily all right and ye are complete in him amen which is the head of all principalities you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word and to give these out brother Wen uh I wanted you to have the copies of these uh quotes because hey I know I had my coat clean cuz the tag still there yeah I better check then but now we've been talking on some things and trying to get a a point to you about uh God in his ways and we believe that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily because we believe in one true and living God we do not believe in the trinitarian concept of three literal Gods neither do we believe in the god in three persons Blessed Trinity because uh a person is a personality personality is an individual individual is a person so then you're going right back to your old concept of trinitarianism we believe in one true Living God and Jesus was that God made manifest in flesh according to John 1 you know and and going into in the beginning was the word word was with God the Word was God then verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so we believe in one true and living God Amen all right now but we've been looking at it in the form of trying to uh comprehend the scriptures and the things and looking at at our day and and seeing it and knowing that there's a compound meaning to scriptures and compound Revelation uh he says out of Egypt he brought his son well all right that was Jacob coming out of Egypt you know the children of Israel all right then uh it would be Jesus Christ because when he was born you remember he they took him down to Egypt because they were trying to kill all of the the children all right and see then it has a compound meaning and a compound Revelation to it so what speaks of the bridegroom you know God himself will be speaking of you and I too which are the bride amen all right so then read the Bible that way read it as a thought relating to you right not just reading about somebody else you must read it that way you must study it we were comparing it last night like like Hosea sure Hosea was a time element speaking about Israel right all right and then you can take that after you get that time element thing out of the way you can move on to see uh the things that maybe related to you and I are related to Israel in the natural you know in our day because you you you don't want to just look at the Bible as just being a historical book it is it's the history of things you know all right but it's not a it's not just a book of History it's a book of Prophecy it's a book of Revelation it's a book of of the word being revealed and you and I are being revealed yes see because that's the point that I'm trying to get us to see amen is looking at ourselves read the Bible for yourself it changes things drastically when you begin to read yourself there like it says by his stripes we we are healed well I say by his stripes I am healed all right now see then that way it will be more meaning to you and that's the way God wants it to you and I he wants us to see ourselves uh every age or every group of people that's ever amounted to anything in God has always been people that saw themselves amen you know I mean Moses his mom had told him he the deliver he was raised up thinking about being the deliverer waiting hoping maybe a day would come that he could do something you know because he believed it but yet in all of that it didn't do him any good because he failed all right but five minutes in front of the burning bush when God spoke to him then here he goes towards Egypt first he's running out when he could have met an Insurrection and and took over the government by uh because he was in the head of the armies and things you know but he couldn't do that because it wouldn't to out and be right but when he was in front of the burning bush all right then there he met God he went back with a stick amen right and took over a whole nation and just ravaged the nation destroyed it just because of his contact with god well I if you and I haven't had a personal contact with god oh you know then you're talking about what God has said about somebody else you can't read the Bible as being personal to you unless you've had a personal experience of the new birth with the god of that word and then when you do you'll see that he's speaking see this Bible is a book of names Peter James John Etc but it tells what goes on during their period of time they were here and it tells what they were speaking of we've read here today of Paul in Colossians he was speaking of Jesus Christ right fullness of the godhead yes but then he says comes over you know and ye are complete in him right all right he's bringing it down to you and I right because we can read that if not why not just throw the Bible away and say well we don't have anything now this Bible then is speaking to you and I amen that's right when you read it read it that way amen that it's not only speaking to you and I it's speaking about you and I and that's the point of the Book of Revelations everybody's always said stay out of it you know well why it's the book that speaks of where we're at amen right it's the thing that tells what's going on out here in the day in the time that we're living you know and then you can see the the things that are that are going on I was asked to come in about the uh things that's going on now where that this certain and I won't call the names but this certain person you know got a big video from the pope of Rome to declare that he wanted to be brothers with all of the Protestants you know well you've seen it and viewed it well you know I mean I'm thrilled you know why I'm thrill all right now back about 5050 years ago maybe a little longer during the time the prophet was on the earth as to bring in the end time message that we believe you know amen it started in an age of people and Eagles right and you going down the road and need nobody no matter where they even Christian or whatever it is everybody boy the the industry went haywire making Eagles to sell everybody they put them on their barns they put them in the the houses they put them everywhere over the churches they don't even know any relationship maybe as to what you're talking about you know why cuz it was the age and time of the eagle to be here all right well see now they're beginning to pick up on the basis if you listen to the man he said he come in the spirit of Elijah well I don't think he was meaning that he was Elijah cuz he goes on to explain it the church is believing you know 8 10 years ago down in Florida there was or somewhere down that way there was a church that started out believing that the people was Elijah and started a six-month Revival well then you know people are beginning to talk about it if you understand what I mean they're begin to talk about the unity they're beginning to talk about the the uh point that that you know Elijah is to come and but then they want to make it a whole group of people well you know what I I believe that that's exactly what I'm trying to preach I'm trying to preach about you and I becoming one with God Amen and being the end time people right that are to manifest God in the end time am the prophet brought his message somebody's got to make that alive Martin Luther the Catholic Church wasn't afraid of Martin Luther when he walked out himself I mean he just another Coupe excommunicate him you know they wasn't concerned with it didn't even raise an eyebrow when he nailed that thesis up but when the people begin to rebel and say Luther taught this then the Catholic Church got concerned because they were losing a lot of their converts to protestantism if you heard that man there he said now the protesting is over he said you're no longer protesting because that ended you know well it may have ended for a lot of people like that but it hasn't ended for the end time bride that's right I'm still protesting but not necessarily just a Catholic church right I'm protesting all religions whether you want to call them branhamites or Lula ites or whatever you want to call them I'm against all religious things that against the word of God sir all right see then you say well what are you trying to create a Revival I wish I could I surely been trying for almost 50 years now because this is what I've been preaching the bride becoming one with God the first message that I preached in 1969 was what the Bride of Jesus Christ is to be the son of man amen well you know I believed it then right you know what I firmly believe it now you know what the world's testifying of it now if you understand what I mean they're beginning to say the spirit of Elijah right why because it's among the people amen and see it's getting very deceiving yes sir right right to show you how I was illustrating to some of them my wife and them yesterday about it see you come up and you say well there's only one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus well that's scripture right well you know what a mediator is an intercessor well you know what if you quoted that to me and he said I don't believe in this about you know this that and the other you know what I I give you a page number out of marriage and divorce where you're prophet ET said a pastor was an intercessor so I'd say don't you believe that your pastor is an intercessor right they believe their Pastor their Pope is an intercessor amen how close is it to the truth come on Church see you say well we don't believe it like they believe it what's the difference right an intercessor is an intercessor but the thing of it is see they believe their intercessor is infallible right right but we don't believe that our intercessors of people is infallible amen we don't even believe that brother brandham was infallible we believe that message he brought is infallible right amen and see that way then I mean they can throw it right back in your face and use the quotes against you but which one is it see is brother random my intercessor they say the pope was their intercessor you see we can't just argue thoughts anymore or little Concepts well I don't believe it like you believe it as what I asked my sister one day when she was talking about the Catholic church I said would you mind explaining to me the difference in the Catholic and the Protestant well she stumbled and stumbled a little bit matter why she said they worship Mary and we worship God or Jesus I said that's not true they don't worship Mary they ually as an intercessor true they're not worshiping her they're using her as an intercessor well are you listening to the ministry that's an intercessor for you you see how easy it is to be caught into Catholicism but yet we're so no we don't believe in that don't believe in what it's just you know forgive me for that if you want my opinion on something ask me I'll tell you but I'm tickled to death that there beginning people are beginning to talk about that those people are the spirit of Elijah you know why because there a spirit released amen for the real bride to begin to believe who she is and what she's here for and I'm glad of that all right but think about it now we've been doing something for quite a while to try to encourage your thoughts and we ask you to read or hear the message Masterpiece and see not there with the Shook and the things you know but I've been trying to take things and come through them to bring it up to show you that it starts you know understanding and it goes up to a uh height of understanding all right and we talked about the grain of wheat that the Lord Jesus spoke of he said unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone all right well we know that he did die and went into the ground or else he would have B he only been him all right but then a church come out from that from that one grain of wheat that went into the ground which was the Lord Jesus Christ out of there came the bride on the day of Pentecost amen you know in in in the book of Acts all right but we know that that was a compound meaning because it spoke as Jesus was saying you know that it was speaking of that the bride would go into the ground all right that's your compound meaning or compound Revelation your thoughts are looking at it see Jesus was not only speaking I've got to die and go in the ground but he said I'm going to come back into church I'm going to start the church it's going to do great for a while but said then it's going to go into the ground cuz if not you and I wouldn't be here because if they went on back there in the book of Acts right on the end of the word they had the great Apostle Paul if they' have went on with the word God would have just finished it up and you and I wouldn't be here but that corn of weed had to die and go into the ground so the bride had to come down in the Dark Ages and the thing and go into the ground and Sprout back out in the days of Martin Luther right of the Lutheran church and we believe what he taught that the just shall live by faith all right now if you've read any of the things about it which you ought have noted a long time ago I know in in 199 something that that the Lutheran signed that because they were trying to agree over the communion that was the basic split the church and I remember that from way back there all right but see it did start a Reformation right a reform he wanted to reform the Church not destroy the church the people went out and took what he taught and went out and started burning the buildings he wasn't against the buildings and the people what's a matter with the building right you going to burn anybody burn the person in it you know come on the building don't have anything to do with it it can't talk right but the people so it took it wrong and Luther said well that's not what I was trying to show you he wanted to reform Wesley wanted to reform all right coming down to Methodist Baptist Presbyterian P then into the Pentecostal to come back to be the carrier of the grain all right the same grain that went into the ground's got to come back in the end time you believe that all right who's going to make it manifest there's got to be a bride in the end time to believe that that's the point I've been trying to make so keep your mind in the thought of what I'm saying about it we see people will say you know and I wrote this down where i' remember people would say I don't see nothing going on well why don't you open your eyes John the Baptist the one that it speaks of as being the greatest of the prophets never done one miracle but there was nothing going on he was introducing the Messiah right amen but you see what we want to do is we want to see to believe if I can see it I believe it brother random says 12 times seeing is not believing I mean that's just that quote alone seeing is not believing if you can see something there's no need to believe that's right I I've got on a shirt they can see it on the internet I got on a shirt I don't have to believe for a shirt I've got it on that's a scientific fact that once you can see something with a natural eye that's there in reality there's no longer believing it that's scientific the Bible doesn't say I see to believe the Bible said have you uh David said in the Psalms 2713 I had find it unless I had believed to see y the goodness of God but we say well if I could see something going on I believe there something going on that's the blindest stupidest statement that anybody could ever make because you're showing how dumb you are the fact that you're breathing a is a miracle right especially in this day right right but you see that's the point we want to try to make well brother so and so said he didn't believe nothing going on well forget it is brother so and so God no well then if he ain't God I ain't going to worry about it then I know God's not going to say there ain't nothing going on right amen right but see that's where we think we make it look beautiful for ourselves but not knowing how stupid we show ourselves to be the very fact that there is a bride of Christ who above all the denominationalism and above all of the denominationalism that's in the message and that for somebody to just simply believe is a master Miracle that's right but see then I don't have to worry about it because I can stand and talk about how I've seen the sick healed the dead raised people the storm spoke out of existence three people as Brother Gary wants to talk about back there you see then I don't have to brag I just tell what took place right but then you got somebody like I was telling them last night the nothing's going on was nothing going on you know the dead rais sick healed all kind of things but nothing's going on but you let one little thing happen you let them get a toothache and it go away you let them just yaking about it you know get a toothache and it go away it's in the Anderson Independent or Atlanta Journal they so and so had a toothache and it went away see because they wanted they want to talk about the things to them well God don't talk about them he talks about a church a bride that can believe and if we can believe it we'll see it but we'll never see you know first and then try to believe it you don't need to believe it if you can see it that's right I've seen God do I'm not I'm not questioning whether or not he exist right right amen but see that's our point because we look at something then this something like this comes up on the Internet systems or comes up on this that or the other and they just go Haywire you let this guy die and a pope come out of the United States blood said Pope out of the United States oh my Lord this man's got the most western ideas you've ever seen in your life and the one before had Western ideas you don't have to come out of the United States right as a matter of fact it could be the people in the United States that are more popish called brandom I Lula IES Huda IES or whatever you want to be it's just time to get down Church to believing what the prophet has said that's right amen right and you know what we don't have to make that manifest that's right God has never asked anybody to make manifest he's asked us to believe it where he can make it manifest right if we believe it he can make it manifest amen what if brother R would have stood back lord now when you get through doing it I'll believe it no he confessed it do no matter what yes and he confessed God as a Healer he confessed the third pull and his wife was so sick with a growth on her side until it was pitiful well I believe for everybody but my wife I must have a little unbelief there somewhere no he knew what was going on that's right you know what one day God spoke to him why because he didn't have to see to believe he believed to see can we do that can we believe what the prophet of God has taught us if not then why do we confess the message of the hour that's right I mean get out of it go something back to something else and shout and have a glory good time but you see Church he's waiting on somebody to believe it right you know the whole world was waiting on Martin Luther to believe that just shall live by faith come on and you know he taught it you know the world begin to believe it right and you know what I still believe it don't you but you show how you seeing in that how dece in it is that they broke down to join together and says we believe now that the just lives by faith alone well you know it's not in the Bible it's not in the Bible that the just shall live by faith alone that was Martin Luther who added that thought to that but it come from the thought that that's what the Bible was saying right amen that the just shall live by faith alone and see they were even quoting Luther when they could say the word alone's not in the translation but then they went on to say and it was true they went on to say the man did it in other words faith without works he didn't use those exact terms but it's close faith without works is dead we believe in that amen right I believe that you shall live by faith don't you amen alone but I believe Works must follow that Faith or else I don't have the faith right how deceiving can it be where are we at but think about it now we spoke this past Sunday trying to uh you know and that's the reason I've kind of moved over letting these brothers preach uh you know the Wednesdays the word that I'm more here over the the weekend and some of you can't come on Wednesday so I honor that and try to get you to a point that you know to where you can we'll try to deal with the Sundays and um it also lessens my voice a little bit and you know I am getting a little older I call Brother Richard Wilson today and the first thing I said to him I said how does it feel to be an old man cuz he's 75 you know and I said how's it feel I said I'm not an old man how does it feel to be 75 you know cuz I'm just 73 and be 74 in another month well I don't know what it is to be 75 brother dick but you do see you're an old man I'm a young man trying to catch up with you okay but now listen I hope you follow the thought yes that we're trying to bring yes and we ended up last Sunday with an an outstanding statement that I want to pick back up and we'll go on with it and then I know we won't get through this so keep these notes till this afternoon the Lord willing we'll try to get through this today of the point I want on this message but you remember what we ended up talking about a very odd way brother brandham saying something that was taken from Christ the Myster of God reveal so go ahead and pull up number one uh I don't know who's back there who's who's running the show now is it automatic okay but listen to what brother Brown says on paragraph 143 Christ is the mystery of God revealed but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way he could express it was to be become a son of man now listen that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it what he was a father when he created Adam and Eve right he was God when he created the angels and they worshiped him but that father of creating Adam and Eve was not the father he wanted to be it was not the full expression so when he stood on Earth as son of man the word made flesh he never declared himself to be the Son of God that's right he always spoke of son of man well they couldn't understand it and like I told you even Paul never wrote of it in his writings you know I mean the Matthew Mark Luke and John talks about son of man but that was what Jesus was saying none of the writers spoke of Paul Peter and John and them didn't speak of son of man why because that was not for that day we'll get to it later when we talk about a dispensation of this and that and the other and but think about it see the only way he could express a father the way he wanted it done was to become a son of man see then can't you see that as he spoke the word he was literally the parables in the things was literally speaking his seed word into being right that's right he literally created did by his own words that's right the bride amen that would come forth on the day of Pentecost that way he could be the father he wanted to be right not it's just like a father to be a Creator I mean come on you just have kids and then you throw them away you know well you're not a father you're a father when you got to put up with all their problems and troubles you you got to do as you know Terrence did yesterday being Grandpa he he's done it before but he learned how to change diaper well that was a different part of life that he'd never experienced probably cuz I doubt he ever changed one of the boys yeah I mean I don't know I'm just saying that you Lisa say no so you know and I can't you know I'm I know I'm mean and arrogant but I try to get you to life a little bit oh brother Joe Canada he used to haul his kids cuz they live not too far he would haul his kids when something happened that Rachel had to be gone and Joe had the kids and one of them you know he could get that uh TT diaper you know but when it come to the other one he put the kid in the car and drive it a mile up on the hill to his sister to get her to change the baby I didn't know that was what was going on they were house one time and we were keeping josi you know me and him and Richard well Richard didn't know that much that it was that big of a problem and Joe was trying to change the diaper oh my Lord I'd have been glad to one in there and changed it and I didn't know it but they were in there and Jo and got these things all over his head he's trying his best to what are you getting at brother Dale I'm not trying to be funny I'm just telling it like it is see brother Joe experienced the part of being a father that's right I mean he'd experienced a part of being a father by fathering the child but he'd never experienced what was going to take place next well is that right that's so God he could be father by creating and by creating ad and Eve and no matter what went wrong you still would have the part of him could show himself as being father right through the Old Testament you know but yet that was not what he wanted and then we see then that the bride then as we said a moment ago was to be what she was to be him made manifest and if he was the corn of wheat that went into the ground or would abide alone then the bride would have to go into the ground which would be that same one seed it's not seeds of many as Galatians 3:16 say see he's not a seed and we're seeds of many we him made manifest that's right all right see then he wanted a bride right amen why because it was part of him right so he begin to speak the bride into existence am and they begin to talk about her as having to go into the ground also right he began to speak of his bride and his The Parables read The Parables over and over the kingdom of God is liken them brother Bob done a good job the other day this past Wednesday speaking of that one about the the uh three measures of meal see that that's even argued that he probably might not even know that's been argued in the message people that that ain't right you know well see you talk about leav yeah well no you can't have no word leav well that Parable says the kingdom of God is lik UN to leaven well that was organized religion put in maybe he didn't even know that that was really what that was he was right on the line I thoroughly enjoyed his message you know I I think it was the best he done that was just my way of saying it that's best he's preach but think about it when he was on Earth that son of man had a whole lot more meaning than just God in human flesh right amen true he didn't have a natural seed that he sowed he had the word right that he sowed all right and then that word could come alive in the people and the people on the de Pentecost was his children his offspring as he wanted it to be that's why in the Old Testament you don't have sons and daughters of God because the Holy Ghost had not been given the ability to be that had not done and he had not spoke them into existence right that was what I was trying to get out Sunday he had not spoken into existence he had to come and speak it right before it could be made a reality all right but see then this whole seven Church ages is the reality of God's family and to return back to the original grain again in the end time right and to be God made manifest and like I kept trying to tell you when I'm talking about God made manifest today in his fullness in his bride I'm not meaning just this end time group of people that's come out of Lady o sea that would only be part of God I'm talking about the whole bride of Christ all those Church ages the book of Acts and all the bride of Christ can be the fullness of the godhead bodily cuz remember you and I as individuals cannot be the fullness but as a group right come on this is just the dispensation or the time I I wish you'd do me a favor until I get back and preach on it I wish you'd look up dispensation brother ry's message and I'd like to hear your explanation of why that he emphatically states in the scripture does a dispensation of the Gentiles you know the word dispensation is not used there in the Gentiles it used a time but why would he turn around and say I'm I'm a dispensationalist and if you don't believe in dispensations what do you going to do with the scripture then he turns around and said I'm not much on being I'm not much of a dispensationalist three times he says it what does he mean right that's exactly right first off I'll tell you the word dispensationalist is not even in the dictionary you know not the old Websters it may be in the modern day forms you know but it's dispensation is there dispensational but not dispensationalist he had his own word but he had a meaning for that he had a reason for saying it but why would a prophet say he was a dispensation then he says he wasn't a dispensation you might have find out what a dispensation is right see that's why I try to keep something dangling you know remember the old story I don't mean you're dumb in the MU but you know the old story of the donkey and you know and the guy trying to get it to go and and he's sitting back on the wagon and Donkey won't go and he just sticks a carrot out in front front of it that old donkey goes after that carrot you know what he does he pulls the wagon I try to keep something ahead of you for you to think right and study it I love for you to study you I love to have questions and answers and listen to people talk about their God I definitely love to talk about mine but now watch he wanted to express himself as the father that he wanted to be that the Old Testament never achieved all right then the prophet gets down to the end of that he says that it was one of the three-fold purposes was to express him himself identify himself with human beings he said well he did that in the Old Testament H to reveal himself in Christ he never revealed himself back there to those people he did the best he could amen and they done the best they could understanding that's right but they didn't have the new birth what do you following me then yes his very purpose is to uh I'm trying to make this to you that are here to understand it to make it for everybody to understand the then when Jesus Christ came upon the Earth he came for a purpose of dying right to pay the price for our sins all right now in doing that then he was not only paying the price for our sins he was achieving what he wanted to do that's right that's why he kept saying son of man right now you don't pull quotes on me cuz I I I love them but you know where brother rown says and he'll say it he said now he never called himself Son of God well I can give you a quote where brother R said he did call himself Son of God so don't get all tied up and Tangled with quotes get what he's talking about it was never a dispensation of the Son of God while he was here it was the dispensation of son of man all right right see then because he was wanting to be a father that could bring into being his family remember we were in him remember he came here with us in him we didn't come here as everybody's trying to teach it today all these Seed doctrine that we come here with a God in us you getting the wrong way but he came here with us in him Eve wasn't in Adam I mean Adam wasn't in Eve Eve was in Adam a little bit different sir that's right all right see and understanding it then trying to look at it and see that God's purpose has always have been to reveal himself that's right but you know what he's always used mankind to reveal himself whereas once he was in one man to stand up on Earth and that's why he said the works that I do the thing I he said you'll do greater right well there's no way of doing greater than what he done go we can't die for the people's sins right but it means more amen why because now he's in a many membered body around the world not just in a bunch of Lites that's right that's why you become an i is when you think you're the only I you're the only one that's got it no I've never taught nothing like that in all the 50 years I've been preaching this message almost cuz I started out believing that God would be in his church in the end time and manifest himself that way and I still believe that and I won't be satisfied until I see it and when if I don't make it you have to go put me in that grave and you sprinkle a little dirt over me and just say he still believed it and right on my Tombstone I'm looking forward to you getting me out of here right why because I believe in a god living in the people a God in heaven is not worth nothing that's no more than a totem pole right God in the original in the beginning when man sinned he didn't go back up into heaven and stay there he came down in the garden and actually made the first murder he killed the first animal himself to make an atonement with the Skins to put on Adam and Eve right well I guess you think that he what he done he just created he he spoke skins into existence it's all right you believe what you want to believe cuz I've got a problem when I'm reading the prophet then when he said those bloody skins was flapping on the legs of Adam and Eve as they were walking out of the garden how do you think you'd feel you know you don't have no clothes you need something I go down there and I just grab this cow or something especially for me to have to have one big enough and you know and then this while it's still bloody just wrap that around you boy I made you some clothes man a stinking mess how long you think it's going to take that thing to dry and even when it dries it still stinks right it's lot different than what we think it is amen but you see church God wants to live in his church as we say he took our place why right so that we could take his place but we're not Catholic see the Catholic believe the pope is instead of God no that's incorrect if he said he was in God's stead I don't have no problem going along with him right right any Minister as I said a while ago as an intercessor right he is the one trying to lead you to God but he's not the one to be worshiped come on Amen right all right see then looking at it to find try to find ourselves in the word right and to see in the word what God says we are right right all right I love that scripture where he says I in you and you and me now you can understand I in you right because he come down come in you but how about you in me right amen that changes things a little bit around don't it right see God is trying his best to get you and I to see who we are and to believe who we are amen come understand about Martin Luther what good would it been for him to protest everything and every week he's out there this it that's it nobody didn't believe it well he could have preached the rest of his life away and the pope would have just laughed at it that's right but when the people begin to believe what Luther said and stop going to their Penance right right then they begin to lose the money and they got concerned y you want to know what's going to cause the devil to come after you and I we've been in this for 40 something years talking about the devil coming after the bride right you know what's going to do that is the same thing he said that I gave you the other day when the people begin to say I and my father are one and these other things right the devil's going to get mad at you well I I heard brother so and preach a sermon 40 years ago I my father's one yeah he went off in polygamy now he wouldn't saying that by revelation right he was saying by hi knowledge it's not when you and I quote anything by hi knowledge right it's when it's first revealed and you can see that what does God do first he makes it manifest right then he reveals that he's manifest then he'll make it a manifestation to others when are we going to believe who we are and what we're doing here well we're just here to go to church and be good people we're just waiting on the bus to pull up you know then this thing's going to be over with well like I told you if it don't pull up pretty quick I'll see you at the nursing home CU for you hear me preach you're going to have to be there you know what cuz that's where I'm going to be Terence them done got it all picked out oh Lord which one huh what you see Church Why not start talking about who we are but yet right get off of it get on your message listen if I can read from the prophet and the prophet will say that the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily but see we want to believe that brother brandham was the fullness now that will never work John on patmas only represented the bride he was not the whole bride he was only in representation that's right you see we've had the day of the Prophet we've had the Eagles on everybody's building as I say while to go but when is it going to come to the time when somebody start saying I I am the message you remember the Welch Revival and the guy standing there you know and the fell went up to him and said where's the Revival he said I'm the Revival well you know he meant it that's right that's right that's where the Revival was at well I've been having a Revival ever since I've been in this message I don't have to be pumped up every day you know boy I love to hear over brother on he just pumped me up I don't have to be pumped up I stay pumped up because I believe the reality of God's word am and then it's being made manifest yes that's right but when are we going to believe it all right but if I can read to you what he says about it then at least you can see that's why people won't come and argue with me about things because they know that I prove it well there's no need of coming cuz like I said don't come and tell well brother Dale I don't believe that the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily oh my well who are you are we basing it all on you no no no brother so and so said it oh well if brother so and so is contrary to brother random then brother so and so is wrong I don't care who he is you me who he is he's wrong that's the stand I take and I've always took it Hallelujah so I don't have to py patter around I'm straight plain and blunt but I want you to show me where I'm off the word cuz if you don't then you go run your mouth about me then you talk to God you got to settle that with him cuz you ain't settle it with me cuz I ain't nothing anyway it's just what I believe cuz this is not something new no 70s we were talking about it brother Mo preaching statue of perfect man in 1971 1969 I was saying the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man than so it's not something new to talk about because I believe it's old as the Bible is yes you know right yes cuz I I believe that's where I got it from was from the prophet of God bringing us the Bible right to speak to us about it all right so let's start reading a few then we'll you know maybe I didn't lose too much but doing but sometimes you have to go your way go ahead with number one a and let's pick up these things and move on some of these quotes some of them you had from last week but then I just kind of pulled over a little a little bit retitled them re Reed them and brought them for today cuz I wish you'd keep these that's the purpose I made them for you the purpose I made them for you to take that home with you now if you don't believe me my my little curing case is in the office you know what I do when I believe something I got a lot of them in there and I just take that and I fold that up and I stick it in my Bible case yes you know and then when somebody says something I say well read it you this is what I believe read it then I don't have to have the computer don't you're wonderful but I have what the man has said You know here and if I can say he said it then I keep that with me I honor these things and know I will when we get on to the son of man a little further on in I I want you to do the same again take them fold them up put them in your Bible keep them with you and somebody comes along they say I heard your pastor preaching about son of man where do you ever get anything like that he got it from the prophet read it that way you ain't got to argue with nobody that's true that's right you can just show him what the prophet said right now we believe that the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right right we believe that same God dwells in a many membered body as we read that he's the head of the body amen then in doing that why can't we believe that we are his offspring as Paul said over in the book of Acts what why can't we believe that we're the children of God well now in a way I guess you can say come on that ain't even good Baptist had more knowledge of that in the Baptist Church in that way I at least tried to believe it so let's just read a few look what he says here on the message sir as we would see Jesus 1957 8 before the evening service paragraph or E three there's many different gifts that God has to his church but they're all for the perfecting of this church to bring together in unity the great body of the Lord Jesus Christ the powers that was in Christ has been given to his church correct amen does that need interpreting you know do we need a a discourse to explain that he said it I believe it that's right all right well in a way well I want you to give me the quote where he says in a way cuz I'll give you the quot where he says when you say it's in a way that he says that can't be that's right because that's a direct quote when he says you say it's in a way he says it's not in a way it's either right or wrong right all right all the powers that was in Christ has been given to his church all that God was he poured into Christ and Christ was God manifest on Earth and all that Christ was he poured into his church and all the powers that God had rest in Christ and the fullness of Christ rest in his church so what a people this should be what a people you and I should be if that was the only statement we had what a group of people you and I should be that's right amen how many times did Brother br make that statement all God was he poured in Christ all Christ poured into the church take it back to the Garden of Eden run it into your computer and just tell me how many times he said that hundreds but do we believe that yes well brother so and so said he didn't know because you know brother so and so must be your God right well you shouldn't be that arrogant why not this is life or death to me that's right what is it to you that's right this a good thing to be around a group of people my Lord you have better Fellowship over in the Baptist church and they listen to you more right wouldn't look like a SED bunch of prunes I amen what I believe when you don't amen you don't believe it cut done settled okay I don't back off number two look what he says from Christ's mystery God reveal preach in 63 728 paragraph 372 where once partly Moses had him okay partly David had him oh my but here he is manifested in the fullness come on now deity himself standing on earth now that's talking about Jesus Christ right God in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to that he might bring to his church a Sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church y to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days well what listen now are you just pinch yourself a little bit now what does he mean pinch yourself just in other words not necessarily cause you sound asleep and snoring pinch yourself can you believe I can believe it when I see it you're out of the scripture right I believe to see right the goodness of God Amen you read all in between roll it on up where we can see the rest of it paragraph 375 and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass ever promised word of God in these last days when he gets to preach I agree with that right I wrote it on mine you know pinch yourself why can we let this word go through US yes and him be the preeminent well I just don't see him in preeminence that's problem Oh what is your concept concept of preeminence well when I see a people that somebody get the word every move they might God told me to do it God told me to do it God told me to do it God told me to do it now you show me brother brandham that's right I'll argue with you I'll argue with him with you about where that he was told to go a certain way in Africa right God told him to go that's right but because the people were backing him he told Billy Paul we've got to go with them oh but you see we want to get everything to what we think preeminence I believe he had preeminence in Martin Luther while he was sitting in the pub drinking beer that's right nargan Doctrine that's right don't you think God was pleased to dwell in Martin Luther come on that's right the Bible says he's pleased to dwell right but you see we've got our own mind our concept of a preeminence as to be some great height and our height is so high until no one will ever be able to reach it it's always a little out of our reach right but that's our concept of preeminence that's right but see when I start talking like that then you think I don't believe in living the right life I've done told you before I don't believe in living the right life I don't believe in living good you said brother Dale you mean you go I didn't say that I said I didn't believe in living good I believe in being born again and let God live right cuz the best I can do is no good there filthy rags in his sight that's right but you see that's where people just take little statement like that put that on the internet now cut it he said he didn't believe in living good well I guess he believes in it's going out living like the devil no if you live like the devil that's who you are right right come on see I do believe that we to be striving for a closer walk with God every day and that the opening of his word order to create a hunger in our hearts of striving to try to walk in his word until he you know what gets me 99% of you are sitting there and looking at me staring and you think this sister don't understand what I'm talking about she shaking her head that's what makes me sick I don't care where it's my family or who it is I speak it like it is well they they don't understand they might understand more than you do amen sorry not sorry for what I say sorry I had to say it preeminence I believe in a place coming I believe God got a preeminence in brother brandom yes right that he was just walking as straight as he could go but yet he had problems and human thought because he was a human being I believe he had pre prence in Jesus Christ don't you and he said I do nothing until my father shows me that's it that's right around said he didn't do nothing until he seen a vision come on okay right brother D get back on your message when he gets a preeminence I believe this is the only age that he could achieve a preeminence that he wants I do believe that because it's the only age that's got the word all right look pre in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also even more than this shall he do I explained that that's not different that's just more because there's more of us all right before I go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get a get somebody that can see it that they can let the word they can let the word go through them right okay and what is he call them don't forget what we're talking about that he said in the quote above what all the powers that God has rest in his church that's right right come on look at number three we would see Jesus 62712 e 53 same thing tonight now he's talking about fullness of the godhead bodily was in Christ and see other people had it by measure we believe that we believe none of us has the fullness of the godhead bod I don't believe brother randam had the fullness of the godhead Bly all now I'm going to make a statement that's going to really strong hit you cuz you better realize and follow the message right when Jesus was a baby he was almighty God but the fullness was not made manifest he could not die for our sins right as a baby he could argue with the priest when he was 11 12 years old or something but that was total not total preeminence was it where does brother brandham bring the fullness of the godhead bodily into being on the River Jordan right see because then he was capable of doing all that God was required of on earth dying for the people and the times so you see what I'm talking about yes the same thing tonight by the holy ghost that would be enough right there without even a quote of what says God on the day of Pentecost that Pillar of Fire broke into many tongues of fire fork Fork tongues and said God was separating himself among the people that day God was in one person Christ now he's in the entire church Universal and he says amen and he's not just in Lula he's Universal Lula by itself not the full well what God's done he just put all his godhead into Lula because he brought everybody here they're here from Africa they're here from Zimbabwe they're here from Guyana they're from all no I've never taught you that and you know it I've always taught that around the world the Bride of Jesus Christ will be God made manifest and you know what without them you and I are not perfect the bride around the world right Universal we just have a little part right even if we have the part right come on but look what he says that day God was in one person Christ now he's in the entire church Universal all right look at the next one choice the father 1954 81 E34 I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the fullness of God is raining down on the church today see this is going to make people unbelievers and I realize when I'm preaching this message today and making it as strong as I am it's going to make people hear unbelievers cuz you're not going to believe what he says you're going to believe what somebody told you or some concept that you've got so it's going to make unbelievers okay so look I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the fullness of God is raining down on the church today it's far whosoever will no we PR predestinated y okay God promised it in his word that's right what did he promise in his word that his fullness Would Rain Down amen he promised it that's right it's our let's take it look let's go over and possess the ground now they God didn't go over there and kill all the Philistines and the amorites and so forth and swipe it and say now come on in folks that ain't God's way of doing it he gives you the promise and says go get her I love that that's right Divine healings yours tonight go get it God promised you could walk and you could walk and you could walk and you could walk and you can see that's right and whatever is God promised it to you let's go get it God said so he's as if he ain't as good as his word then he's not God there you go let's go possess it ourselves God is in his word do you believe it God is waiting on somebody to just step out and believe what he says that's right he'll make it manifest you don't have to we're not trying to pop up things and make this out we're just trying to believe what he says whatever God promised why can't we believe it but of course we can take healing and we can take salvation right well I just don't believe nobody I don't believe the bride will ever be the fullness of godhead body brother so and so said that and I can call the name that said that they said he didn't believe in it but what does it matter I don't believe it I don't believe what the man said so I believe what the prophet said amen but I believe one thing if we don't go get it it's not for us right if we don't go get it it's not for us all right so let's go get it now we're not the uh prophets you know that was facing and it had already been said that they were going to be down there you know uh 70 years or how many years it was and this guy comes up and bless God I got the spirit on me spirit says we be down there too well you know I've always told you I don't understand I come dumb we can be dumb this man says we be down our 70 and this guy don't say we ain't going why didn't that man get up there and say thus sayith the Lord we ain't going that's right right he knew he had to hold it so he held it we'd be done it two years right I said two years he said 70 let's see which one's right let's go get it if he ain't as good as his word then he's not God that's right but when are we going to believe it amen let's go possess it it's ours that's right okay look at the next one we'll get this in real quick I don't want to get this one because of the wording is all right look what he says in the the India trip trip report India trip report in 1957 126b the e70 he's bringing it down the economy of God the ministry is the chemical can use those chemicals the way he wants to it's just not as much of it he's talking about you and I right I I'm not all of God you're not all of God brother random wasn't all of God right right now think of it but all together I didn't make that statement because remember your Prophet explained why it says more he said because it's in a greater group I didn't make this statement but all together it's more of it than was in the one amen right amen now you see why he said it cuz cuz he's got a many member body around the world yes right yes see the fullness of God is in his church yes but we have the spirit with measure or by measure that's scripture that's exactly right that's why I believe he gave you the quote world of ghost Universal come on musicians let one but the Bride of Jesus Christ is God made manifest in another form called a bride the same God well I just don't believe that we can ever be well all right why can't we believe it though well if I could see it I believe it Psalms 27:13 I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of God seeing's not believing you can see it you don't have to believe it it's a scientific fact right see then what do we believe we believe God's word or we going to believe our own ideas our own concept our own thoughts well I got it right yeah you have to believe what you want to but why don't you let the world know what you believe I guarantee you you ministers you go out there and tell them like it is who you really believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is is and you're going to lose a lot of invitations but if you sof so it you know round about a way you get to go yeah but just tell them like it is of what you believe and you see how long you going to stay CU when you begin to say I and my father are one the Shuck's going to pull away let's stand together go ahead 650 650 in this power book all is is it keep these quotes and read put them in your records and keep them I spend great time but try to accumulate these to where you can read them believe what he said we believe the prophet's message as I said I believe the message is infallible but the man was not infallible he made mistakes he made speech errors he made things with the message he brought Moses the message Moses brought was right right and when he smoked a rock that was the word of God and out came water but when he SM it the second time in Anger said must we F fet you rebels water from the Rock brother around said he set up a denomination see he broke every top in the Bible so Moses wasn't infallible the real message he brought was Luther had problems trinitarianism
