you we say you come one time you're visitor two times you're just part of us so just remember to make our sister welcome amen if you like turnning the scripture turn to Revelations 1 and Revelations 6 now remember to be much in prayer for sister Peggy Gibby there be having her uh foot operated on in the morning somewhere between 12 and 1 so keep that in your prayers and remember that and also remember that the Lord will this coming weekend Wade and I will be covering the Daniel 70 week series uh kind of in a split condition I'll take the morning he takes the evening and we'll be covering it to try to you know help you to understand a little bit about Daniel 70 weeks and see it from the drawings and the things and all and maybe a lot of you already watched the video of the ministers meeting but maybe we'll have a little more time we can you know do a little bit better job of doing it so just remember that amen amen um let's see the announcement oh yeah I'm going to tell you something today I bet you don't even know what today is terrence's birthday that's why we say precious memory yeah that's why I dick was a sing that huh Precious Memories okay all right I just thought you might not have known that but anyhow Revelations 1 and Revelations 6 father we thank you an opportunity tonight to be able to stand before the purchase of your blood to be able to speak the words of life that we lord may be used of you to bring forth the things that needs to be said tonight and then you can Quicken it unto us because we firmly believe that the word must be planted before it can be quickened or made alive so we ask you to just help us and guide us and you use us for your honor and Glory we just commit it all to you remember the sick among us just touch each one and bless and guide Lord because you promised it he said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so have your way now we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1 through3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the time to understand okay let's go over to Revelation 6 we jumped up read Revelations uh 6 3 and 4 the other day but I want us to make make sure we understand so let's drop back and just read Revelation 6 1 and 2 and then we'll continue on into the second seal the Lord willing next week H and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that set on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we spoke back there this past Sunday on talking of the Antichrist and the things but I want to just make sure that we understand a few things and and then if you have uh already looked at the notes or something some of you that get them hold them and we'll come back to them the Lord within next Wednesday on and talking get on to the second seal but we see there that it says that you know when he opened the seal and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now I I I pray that the Lord will give me the correct way to present what I see to you tonight because you know I I want to try to bring something to you I don't want to just get together and have a meeting and just talk on something I want to try to uh you know give an understanding to our hearts and our lives for that's a purpose of being here if other than that we just stayed at home and we could have listen do a tape or done something else but back years ago when I preached on the seals back in it would have been 79 really in the beginning and uh even over into 882 and 3 uh I saw what I believe was the opening of that first seal and I be to see it real clear throughout the scriptures but then there was a kind of a I preached it and you know the best that I could but there was a kind of an understanding Gap that was not filled in real good even though if I went back and listened to the tapes and if you would go back and listen to them you hear me saying the things that I'll say tonight but you know how it is sometimes something opens right that's right from what you preached for maybe 20 years that's been quite a while ago and but I I just kind of had a little gap between the first and the fourth seal as a basics of total understanding of what it was dealing with and the Lord was dealing with me the other day and opened it unto me so maybe I'll try to bring that tonight that's the reason I wanted to drop back to this to be able to get the foundation in the correct order uh it wasn't that I was preaching something I had it right I said if you listen to the texes and then you listen to the not you say well that's what you said well you know you can say a lot of things but when it's revealed right amen there's a lot of difference I pray that the Lord will help us all to understand all right we covered this last the last message you know we were talking about how that this Antichrist as we'll read in a minute that it was so deceiving that it's all it's deceive the whole world right amen you know and in doing that then it's close to deceiving the bride yep because if the Bible hadn't said you know that uh it it would not deceive us then I'm sure it would have done a lot of damage but you better remember the prophet said that we wouldn't be deceived but he said frankly if he didn't cut the work short they wouldn't be any flesh save for a Rapture right so we better be concerned about that and not be our our heads blowed to high so high that we think I can't be deceived that's right that probably is 99% of the people's statement y of the world that they're not deceived did you think you was deceived when you was in the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal or you was in a um uh a night of your own you know what I mean by that you know had your own Doctrine your own idea or thoughts you know and know see it deceived the world and it even deceived the prophet right amen that was my emphasis I was trying to get across because when he comes to that first seal he said I've made a horrible mistake that's right amen if the Holy Spirit hadn't to come down and corrected me on something I was going to pre you say no brother Dale he understood out there when the Angels Came Down well you better go back and read that a little bit that's right you'll find out he said the angel there or the holy spirit said go back to Jeffersonville it'll be told you what to do now either he's a prophet or whatever you want to do about it that's up to you but when he come back he said I don't know what that first seal is that's right well now you're going to make him a liar to say he did right now sure he had a whole lot better understanding than me and you amen right MH that's right you know you see what I'm saying a whole lot better understanding me and you right and a whole lot more capability of being correct right than you and I because he was a prophet now but still if something is not unveiled to him it's not unveiled that's right that's right all right so then we can see that it was the the spirit of Satan work working in the children the Bible says of Disobedience that's right amen turning the righteousness of God into a lie right he said Satan told that same lie that he told Eve well you know Eve believed that lie that's right Adam was not deceived but Eve was she believed that lie it was so close to the truth right until she believed it amen like I tried to emphasize that to you many times I believe he was trying to convince her right not to have an act with him the Beast you know but it was Satan speaking through him he was trying to convince her that she was chosen for this job but that Adam and God wouldn't tell her about it yeah right it wasn't it just the the deception is not the the act on the ground we call it right the deception was in the very heart of Eve that thought she was doing right that's right amen and the World Church system still thinks that you're doing right that's right all right y now but it's so deceiving until John I gave you the quotes there John even admired yes that's right this church system that he saw amen he looked at it and he admired it right yeah see horrible things like we think is G you know demons oh oh they just go around like this you know who we trying to scare the kids or or who you know Satan is very slick with the tongue and the Bible even says that his ministers were as Ministers of righteousness right so that would leave out a law teacher mhm right right that blown up somebody that's a good law teacher that didn't leave him out y he's not even considered into the deception right amen it's not the the guy in the pull pit that tells you it's okay to drink and run around and stuff like that you're going to heaven anyway yeah that's not the deceiving the deceiving is when he's trying to get you to see his Doctrine am and to believe it MH there's your deception that was what I was trying to get across all right so tonight what do we look at now listen to what I'm saying even though the prophet in the first seal seen the Antichrist and even in the first seal he covers him as Antichrist false prophet Beast he covers about the pope and the things in the first se but you see once that part opened to the prophet right of who that by horse rider was MH then he could see that it would be the same Rider to ride on his horse right right even though would turn out to be the second seal red third seal black fourth seal pale it would just be changing the color of the horse M right to represent what was going to be but I believe that when he seen the Antichrist he knew who that was that would be straddling that horse right yes sir amen so when the second seal broke see he didn't have to go back other than to say see here this second seal shows you y that it's the same riter man MH the same Rider it's different horses right right all right now we say well now but that first seal shows the Antichrist well is that only the that all the stages you can see pure Satan is a very deceiving that's right person but this Antichrist that we're going to read here in a second the prophet said you want to know who he is he's the Antichrist right that was Satan right right Satan in his deception amen right he starts out as a spirit Antichrist spirit yeah then he becomes a false prophet then he becomes an incarnate false prophet right being the pope and then he'll turn out to be the Beast one day yes that's right same devil amen same person and that's the way that that seal opened to me was it here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a white Rider see the prophet said look that's a another person that's another that's a guy he call him guy I think three or four times right just prior to the speaking that said who is this it's the Antichrist right he said he's a fellow the Bible said that there was a horse and a rider y right all right now that is opening the seal and get my point now that breaks the symbol of the riter go just as a white you know Rider on the White Horse it breaks the symbol of the rider but it doesn't reveal the seal in its fullness right because there's a whole lot more to the uh seal than just a symbol of a riter that's right yes sir the the riter the symbol if you get what I'm saying once it broke to the prophet he could see that that was Satan changing his form from one form to another as he rode right amen but to be the the same devil right but now watch what I'm saying now we're going to read out of the first seal that he sees this but then he says I don't know what that second seal is that's correct amen but yet he knows the riter MH now are you listening right he knows the riter right he knows who's going to be riding on that red horse he knows who's going to be riding on that black horse amen he knows who's going to be riding on the paale horse that doesn't break the SE right cuz he's a lot more to the seal now remember to find Satan and to know it's him is wonderful but that's not a symbol of a church right you got to break the other symbols right to be able to see that it's a symbol of a church and things right see so it's the same riter every time because it's the devil right yes amen he's just changing his mask mhm changing his way he revealing himself or making himself known because he's trying his best to do but he always does everything in copy after that's right God revealing himself that's why I've always told you then the reveal the devil is not the seals right that's right amen you just broke a symbol y amen you didn't reveal the devil you can't reveal the devil ain't no devil to Reeve reveal right brother Dale there is a devil now don't think I'm that carnal that I don't know what I'm saying the devil's not a person right oh you can call him the person of the devil you can say those say but he's not a person right he has no body spirit and soul to display himself right that's what he tried to do in the garden right through Eve and the Beast to try to enter the human race MH he can't create that was the one thing withholding from him he said but brother Dale don't you think the devil's real yeah he's a real devil right sure is but he doesn't have a body spirit and soul to display himself right if he had it he would went straight to Eve right come on right so we had to use something vicarious mhm he entered the Beast and used that Beast to talk to Eve right he could have spoke to her maybe in some ways through her inner being y but he's got to have somebody to talk through amen that's right so he entered the Beast and used the beast's voice to speak now remember Satan is a created being right amen mhm he was the anointed sherff that Stood Beside the Lord right he's even called in the Bible a man M the scripture he's called a man but that don't mean he's got a body spirit and soul right no he cannot do anything unless he's permitted to do it that's right we'll get to it a minute he has no power no oh look what the devil can do he can't do anything to you unless God allows him if we'd ever get that into our heads amen you know that's right of course that's what people do you know I've been honest with you all I'm trying to preach to you there's things that come up on these human bodies is because of the deterioration it's not to say oh the devil after me I got a bad C well that may be true but it might be because that you run out without a coat on when it was cold that's right so you going to be the devil that made yourself get it all right that's right see there's things that are brought on us because of life right well the devil's making me older now he ain't making you older he can't do that that's right yep that's right come on the Bible says the devil is like a man l in a ditch it has no strength I'm quoting scripture to you and why are we afraid of him right right when the first heal shows you ain't nothing but a bluff anyway right amen cuz he don't have no arrow for his bow right amen we just read it yep you see that's what I'm saying we we look at at it we think well I understand that but really do we right amen why are you afraid of the devil you me like that fell would I heard a story about a man that walking down the road and this guy said his buddy you know he crawled up in the bushes and pull a joke on his buddy and he come walking by and he said hey John he stopped looking him he said I'm the devil I'm coming after you he already praising the Lord he said you don't understand I'm the devil he said I didn't know he that far away from me right we ought to realize that that's right but get the point then when we go through you'll see Satan he's not a person in the point of being a body spirit and soul right he can be called a person or a fellow or a guy or even a man you said well anything a man got to have Body Spirit and soul well see that's where you're missing it right you're taking your theological interpretation right you know what I mean your own idea W you just listen to the word and read it you see that Antichrist he only started out as a spirit MH we gave you the quotes where that when Jesus was here Judas was here right when Jesus was crucified Judas went to a cross y right when the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost the Antichrist come back and started dealing with the church to deceive it that's right what does the prophet called the devil's work attempt destruction of God's word if he can get you to doubt the word of God that's right as being true that's right he's got you amen that's right yes sir we'll find out in a minute he has no Crown you got to be given one right amen well God never gave the devil a crown that's right come on God didn't give him ground that's right we did that's right you say yeah but those people are wonderful people I agree with you but you know why don't we ever thank God for being not being the fact that he didn't let us be to see right amen right we don't have anything against people and their ideas right in churches it's just the fact of trying to find the truth to get us out of here amen right they have to answer to God for their own selves right but get the point now what I'm talking about the Antichrist he starts out as a spirit it's Satan has a deceptive Spirit to try to enter into you and I right okay you don't have much trouble doing that but we were born kin folk to him whether you like it or not you can holler we're talking a while ago about seeds and what people believe in this m you can holler all you want to about seeds and how you come here with eternal life you know people take that they quote brother random oh we come here with eternal life but if he did Jesus Christ died in vain absolutely so something's wrong right the prophet's not saying what we think then is he right all right you see it's time to line it up and get it right amen and quit playing around because we got to walk out of here amen that's right and I don't know if another message has got anything in it do you no no sir I mean this is the only one I know it's got the truth in it amen see get the Antichrist down is what he is the Antichrist is Satan amen that's right he's a spirit right right yep all the Old Testament that's where people don't like me to preach this way but it was never but one man and one woman and they don't most of them even agree with a man they don't want to agree with Eve at it but I believe Adam and Eve had eternal life in their soul amen as an impartation not a birth right they never went to a birth they didn't have to go through justification baptism over it was parted right right into Adam but nobody after them no so everybody after them K folks to the devil right amen right well brother D oh no they had they had an anointing of the Holy Spirit that's right that's why you're Prophet we were talking about one ago he said David said Thy word have I hid in my heart right that I might not sin against thee right you know what R and say it I believe it's the the birth plan spoken word Original Seed he said David needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right said he had everything right right but he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right he had an anointing that could kill a bar a lion or a giant or whatever but when that LE him he could go out and take his best friend's wife and how the man killed yeah and try to cover it up right don't look like a born again Christian no that's right see that's why the prophet would say then these seals just spoke up from Genesis right amen and go all the way back in Genesis and follow it down mhm Y and see what's going on and look back there and see that Eve was deceived right then it went on over Cain was deceived see then Abel was just as perverted as Cain because of this way he come in to the world right amen no Abel was a seat of God go ahead go ahead but he was lost that's right he needed a savior yeah he said how do you know that because he offered a sacrifice that's solve the problem if he didn't need a savior he'd have been standing back Kan you go ahead I don't need it always was eternal yes sir now none of that will fit no amen would you see church until we're born again that devil is living in our soul right because of the perversion and the fall right right amen that's why you got to be born again amen that's right you got to get him out of there we you get the life of God inside of there amen then we can say we're a child of God that's right so no wonder the world is deceived only those who have the new birth is the only ones who can understand amen Satan in his ways that's right man right that's right that's right he so only those that are born again know the difference right now you know the quotes but yet what is quotes without a God to reveal it Revelation amen all right so let's get started now on something I want you to just hold a point through of what I'm talking about Satan rides that first horse while gets off gets on the red right rides it a while gets off on the black rides it a while comes up over on the Pale Horse amen that's just the symbol of the rider amen right you will a first seal yeah what do you ask people what's the first seal Antichrist I thought the seals was to reveal Jesus Christ amen yes that's right and we would see the Antichrist in opposition right amen riding away amen I didn't know the seals was to reveal the devil I thought I just read to you in Revelations one there that this is a revelation of Jesus Christ MH doesn't say anything about the devil right and I hope you understand what I'm saying he's not a he's not a man body spirit and soul so you're not trying to reveal him amen right you already to know who he is oh but brother Dale he is so sweet when he when when the Lord speaks to me he just so sweet Noble but when the devil speaks he just hard I think you got it backwards right amen honest as I can be amen that's right the devil sweet talks you God says sit down shut up and act like a child of God that's right he never told you like that right you got a treat treat coming when he does one day that's right he tells you to quit crying like a baby that's right and get on with living for him yeah am ain't too much sweet sometimes in his voice that's right in Pharisees sure didn't think and he had a good voice when he said you are your are of your father the devil right and his works you will do right right the devil was saying cus you're the high priest everything's wonderful sweet when the Messiah comes he'll walk down this carpet that'll roll out and walk right up to you and say oh great cus that wasn't exactly the way the story goes right all right I get off on that sometimes I get to preach and I'd rather just talk let's just start reading just a little bit and just pick up some thoughts and follow our line so go ahead brother number one this is taken from the first seal paragraph 293 you want me to tell you he's talking about how who he is he's Mighty and conquering power watch watch in the minute where he gets it is a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly what he is one so close together until it would deceive the very leg the bride if it was possible Antichrist is the Antichrist Spirit right amen right now nobody in the early age would have accepted anybody walking out there and says you got to believe me right they didn't seem too many of get in trouble about that they knew the stories about how that you know dayon and cor said Moses you take too much on yourself we're spiritual too they didn't seen that they does seen the great acts in the book of Acts by the what Simeon one of those guys that was using the spirit of the devil Simon Simon and they done rebuked all of that right sure did and they does seen no seven sons of scuba run in there and trying to cast out that devil Y and it didn't work that's right they didn't see what happened to them amen so it wouldn't be a man walk out it wouldn't be someone walk out in that first church age and say hey I'm the devil you got to believe me because he ain't going to say under the second seal I'm the devil right he ain't going to say under the third one or the fourth one right amen when he becomes literally the Beast is he going to walk in the temple and say I'm the devil no right he's going to say what he's always saying I am instead of God right amen because they got enough sense to know how many popes have they had right sure right M two or 300 poke mhm well did the did the God die when the PO died no they believe the Incarnate God moved over incarnate into the next po right right right right right so don't think he'll ever come to you and say I'm the devil Fall Down and Worship me when he come to Martin or which one it was he told him he was Jesus Christ he seen him and he throw to Inkwell at him said get out of here but he you he was right so don't ever look for the devil to walk up to you and say I want you to know I'm the devil no right he's always going to tell you he's Jesus Christ sure that's right he's God are instead of God right so then think about him look at the next one paragraph 266 he's talking about this Antichrist he had a bow in his hand which meant little Cupid that's what they used to think he shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of God and he conquered that's what man used to teach that's what your your theologians teach about the white horse rider now that sounds very good but it isn't true no sir that it wasn't what does mean righteous we we realize that that white means righteous the teachers taught it that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first Age and what but my revelation of it by the holy spirit is not that way now watch his Revelation my Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the selfs same person right amen only in a different form so here stands the L stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he standing here with the books in his hand and there goes this White Horse writer see it wasn't the Holy Spirit right all right now are you following it right where would a trinitarian ever be able to seals to break to them right CU he says Christ yep the holy spirit is a selfs same person amen that's right and he says in the lamb is that person so then your revelation of one God so it was simple you remember I'm I preached this in 79 let Al 8182 in there so brother random was standing there and he he was talking about a white horse rider so he says here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and out there goes the White Horse riter see he knew he was seeing two people that's right one standing there as the lamb which was Christ almighty God the other was another fell riding off right so he knew immediately that there was a problem that that that's how easy it was to be revealed to the prophet that it was the Antichrist it was Satan amen anytime you see two people in the Bible That's why I said a trinitarian can't figure that out see he got people here people there person here and person he just got all kind of the Holy Ghost you ever heard trinitarian the Holy Ghost sent the Holy Spirit down with a sperm into the wound of the Virgin Mary you know got to have Father Son and Holy Ghost involved you never heart hurt him where the Bible said If you deny the father you deny the son which is proven that there's just one God you ain't never talked with one or have excuse me I use the word ant that's okay it's in the dictionary now you never heard them say if I deny the father I'll deny the son and I'm not going to deny I'm going to keep my three person no matter what you say Mery Lord the Baptist I've told you over and over teach and believe even to this day that there's just one God sure right but they say he's God in three persons Blessed Trinity coequal and co-eternal I've made the statements over and over to you and they back here in my office if you want them go into Wikipedia and run up NN counsel 325 ad and it'll give you the the NN counsel and tell you what they were arguing Aras and athanasius was arguing athus was saying that Jesus was a different substance Aras would say I already pronounced his name that he was the same substance right you ask most people to quote the first the Nan Creed have you ever read the Nan Creed at 3:25 ad they establish a Creed right a statement of Doctrine y that statement says that Jesus was almighty God creator and they lambasted or eus for his Doctrine but you need to keep reading a little bit cuz somebody I forgot who it was was giving it to me Sunday sister barara who who gave me that Sunday try Trudy cassant right at 381 MH they added some words to the naan Creed and said Mary the Mother of God we see most people would read something like that but the original Nan Creed states that Jesus was almighty God and there is no other God right amen but then the deception got easing in see right and they started changing it then it begin to bring in all of the other things I wish you'd read it of how the pope had come into the view right now he got started did you see you say one God you know that the muhammadans believe in one God his name is Allah that's right see the world never did believe in a trinitarian Doctrine right until the Catholic Church come along it took to about 606 before the water baptism was changed made into Father Son and Holy Ghost would you hear Brother Ram say at a n see en C 325 ad about everything happened right there it didn't happen there no right he knew it it took time right to get that Doctrine the deception I talking about Sunday into the mind of man right amen like we were talking one ago and I told him I said if time lasted in 100 years from now our great great great great grandchildren ever how long it take great great great I guess or something you know what they say Jesus was married I saw I I didn't see it but Grandpa told me he saw a movie then got it in your mind right they don't got it in your mind M right Y Wonder on the people in this message don't come up with it yeah preacher so call yeah they to go with everything else right but listen church if there just one true and living God and that God is the Lord Jesus Christ there is not another god let's see how does the scripture says those that be Gods yeah there's God's plural right sure 30 how many 300 something million in what is the number 300 and something million in India in India right of gods and goddesses but listen when that Prophet seen that lamb standing there he seen that devil riding off right that seal broke right there right it unfolded the symbols that mankind had been deceived by You See It Was the Same Old Devil in his ways right but then we're not going to be able to have time to get on over into the other but remember there's a whole lot more symbols there it's got to be broke we'll try to cover a little bit this Antichrist he has no arrow for his boat so he's a bluff right right what the prophet called him a bluff he said that devil that when he HS Boo at you yep he said just boo back at it that's right like I always try to tell everybody the devil tells you all about what you've done in your life right you remember you done this you done that you done this you can't be saved cuz look how bad you are yeah would you stop him and say Satan I'd like to make one point there is a possibility of me and being saved but there's no possibility for you that's right that's right and let me tell you what the Bible says about where you're going to be cast into the Lake of Fire that's right amen the Bible says that right that's right amen amen the devil is going to be cast into the Lake of Fire right amen remind him of where he's going right amen get get the point let's move on see the prophet explains then in the first seal there was no ARS for the bow right so it was symbol of a spirit no nothing of his own you couldn't do anything with the bow I've asked you to read the seal book but how many has kept my lessons and done and tried to read with me then when I get up here and try to preach I don't know where you said that or not you know why cuz you ain't never read the book all right but look what he says about the devil now this is in the first seal I want gohe with number three paragraph 367 now remember the Antichrist and Beast is the same self Spirit there Earth the Trinity yeser is three stages of the same devil power remember niia see it had to be incarnate before it could be crowned right and watch this three stages first stage he's called Antichrist second stage he's called a false prophet third stage he's called the beast now we get on over in a minute where there the four stages we don't need to go there let's just think about it right you can't Crown a spirit so you have to do something think so you get a false Propet how comes a false prophet preaching the doctrine that the Antichrist had right that's why it's called a false prophet right see you can't crown him because you can't tell he's not out in the open enough for you to be able to see what's going on he's just teaching the doctrine of the Antichrist so he's called a false prophet you know I've been through it so week or so ago that people read that and they don't even they just say three stages the Antichrist will read in a minute four stages what Antichrist Prophet Pope incarnate false prophet and finally the Beast right cuz see that's for combat right man you Mark Luke John L ox man Eagle right all right now so what is he the rider of each horse is the same going to the next now so when he starts into the second seal what does he say now here's my revelation of it this is Satan again it's the devil again in another form for what's he talking about he changed his horse went to Red it's the same devil Satan again same devil so you see it unfolding from all of the seals it's going to show Satan in the opposition of God right Satan seeing him is that Spirit form first all right he had no BS and no Arrow but he's given a crown now the false prophet that started out Paul would say there's already false prophet prophets among you yep John said that the Antichrist was already Among Us y teachings that deny that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh he's Antichrist right Paul would speak of false prophets cuz they seen them they were already rising up teaching things like two of them always get their names wrong there but two of them was teaching that the resurrection was already passed I think it's F how many that's teaching the resurrection was already p y Paul turned them over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh right right he saw these false prophets but do you know when the pope came into being you read that in a minute it unfolds to us the prophet said that it's the same Rider Changing Horses right that's right horses are powers are symbols amen and that's is where your church starts coming into view as the power cuz where does the PO get his crown right from the people amen right see by the time the pope came into being it had to start out with false prophet Bishops etc etc falling in and these leading to that and this you know it took quite quite a while matter of fact 300 years now I didn't look up to see that's the words of the prophet he said 300 years later the pope came into being you may go home and look it up and find out it's 250 years or something you know whatever just remember we're trying to say something it took a while for the pope to come into view right he didn't come into view in the book of Acts but the Antichrist and the false prophet was dealt with in the scriptures of the Apostles Paul would only speak of the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God but he was looking at it to unfold later on not in his day right now when it does it comes down see he's just a blood amen right F trying to cut out something but he received a crown of Triple Crown we're read a minut yeah right over Heaven Earth in purgatory there's no such thing as Purgatory in the Bible so the pope to get it where he could control the people he come up with a Purgatory you know that every Catholic pope priest who he is has got to go according to their Doctrine to hell when they die and like I said the other day this last one was such a good guy he just made a Whistle Stop and they bounced him right back out of there and he's probably already in heaven as far as their Doctrine is concerned but they believe that everybody's got to go to hell but that's where you come up with a Purgatory where he can scare you with it you get excommunicated from the Catholic Church you realize to them there is no hopes of you ever being saved right they give you a chance to repent you won't do it they gave it to Martin Luther he said I've said what I said right he was excommunicated from the C Church which meant according to their Doctrine he was dead I'm glad God didn't believe their Doctrine right amen aren't you amen but get what I'm talking about a crown was given him the people crowned him the people that had the same identical Antichrist spirit and it went into their false prophets and they begin to preach it and then one day it was incarnate in a pope right a pope the Pope in his original Beginnings I'm reading this out of Wikipedia he didn't have the full Authority even though he had a crown but as it went along it began to designate him as the final Authority y there's many splits in the Catholic Church over the authority of the Pope they used to be two different popes that was back in history but get the point one com where did he get that Crown cuz that first seal that and a crown was given him right now come on follow my points the church gave him the crown amen that's right that's right I didn't say the bride I said the church right right but the bride was caught up in it brother R said they should have never went to n right right right why because they brought back that Doctrine y he said oh no they didn't well argue with your a prophet until it come into the time of later on we get in the Dark Ages and thing until the light is totally put out that's right through the symbols but listen a crown was given God never gave that man a crown right that was Satan right that had become not totally incarnate as the beast but he had become incarnate into a head man called a pope right he could change the rules do what he wanted to you differed with him out you went he was given the power he was given the crown a triple ruling Crown you see over there I'm wrong over Heaven Earth in purgatory the church wound up to be the most powerful organized religion there is and still is today right more land is owned by the church systems than any other Corporation Etc or whatever that's why they're going to try to take away your tax status they're working on it they're taking away because they own millions of billions of acres of land right or properties is owned by the churches that is taxfree right who gave that hope is Crown the people amen right right that's right he just had a little Doctrine little idea got to reminds you of what happened in heaven don't it Lucifer Satan and his angels what was Satan trying to do in heaven take over right and he got all of got one3 and know brother say 2/3 the angels of heaven believe Satan's lie and we're cast out right right those were in the days of demon Spirits right not in human occupation you know people but he came to Earth and brother R said them demons that fail gave us a nature sure that's what I was talking about a while ago we're born kin folks to the devil right amen right and we're trained from the minute we open our eyes a little old baby he can't hard do nothing and lights is all over the place he's lay there and this nurse says boy something in blankety blank baby born all here on full of the Moon more little kid all years in bad words you know you don't have to teach your kids to say bad words no that's right right Mama and Daddy don't say them grandma grandpa don't say them aunts and uncles don't say them they're still say them why you ask that little old kid he's standing there with cookie all over his hand cookie all over his face you ask him said you eat that cookies I know you don't like me in my ways but you look down at a little fell and you say ain't a pretty little devil oh you don't like that about your kids or grandkids or something like that especially but until that baby's born again right right mhm that's right he got somebody he's more K to than you are righten amen but listen he's just a bluff why we're afraid of he was they were the people gave him the crown we'll get down to that quote to me if time look at the next one let see wait a minut let me jump up to number seven we bypass a couple of book number seven cuz you see Satan has no power yep the Bible says it only Powers that's given them God right that's right Satan don't have no power unless we give it to him right that's right he didn't have a crown till the people gave it to him right he wasn't able to kill until he got somebody they would follow his orders right and do the killing look what he says about it don't about the power of life and death that's the only two powers and Satan can only his power he's got is the perverted power of God it isn't no real power it's a perversion of God's power yep death is only perversion yeah look what he calls it in the Third Exodus number eight I got 152 the enemy will purpose always his system and unbelief will accept it because the enemy is the intellectual sign now remember there's only two don't forget this there's only two Powers now I'm he's going to be down here in a minute and answer okay one is spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the other one is the devil working through intellectual power power yep it's on the paragraph up above on the other one he has only intellectual power he doesn't have any power of his own right only what God give him or allowed to work right he allowed that deception to come in to try the real bride right amen Satan don't have any power well there two Powers right what did Brother around say one is spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the other one is the devil working to intellectual for that's where he entered in the Garden of Eden through intellectual powers to make Eve believe in intellectual conception against the word that's as plain as could be even the kids get it y listen church he has no power he can't do anything with you until God turns him loose right right he allowed these things to happen the prophet says and the Bible said to prove you and I right right God never gave Satan any power to control you with he gave him powers and abilities to inflict to do whatever but the holy spirit is there to control you and I amen thank you Lord see you still afraid of the devil and why why are you afraid of the devil you can't do anything until God permits it right amen that's it he can't take your life until God permits him to take you right you want scripture Jo God said you can take him do what you want to with him but you can't touch his life Bible might read the book of job you couldn't touch him Satan can only be permitted and he was permitted to take the church down but it would really to try the real genuine you remember that scripture back there where it talks about if a Prophet come among you and give a sign and the sign come to pass he takes you to another God don't believe him said I've done that to prove you but Brother D I ain't never give no crown or no pop you remember one we read there the other day where brother R said you talk about a preacher and a in a denominational Church yeah he said do what you want to Y we've got real good friends that are preachers and things in these churches I was just yesterday my nephew give me anything to World invited Wade to come up and preach for him the Baptist Church and told Wade said if you hold back anything it's your fault he's a great guy but yet he's caught by that system right and see they're giving their like when I was in the Baptist Church I was kind of like then like I am now I like to look up things and read this is 1950 we left church in' 67 I was ordained deacon at 23 years of age which would have been 1963 I went everywhere and checked out everything you know that we were sending money then from the Baptist conference to ins surrect rights in foreign countries they would not allow the Baptist or Methodist whatever to come to those countries I knew that then you know what I said I said Lord my ti is going to stay at home boy I smart with I'm going to designate mine to be spent home yeah but boy who counted the money did mine stay at home yeah or did mine go with the rest of them no now brother Dale we ain't never been no part of yeah you support a false Doctrine that's why I told my wife the first church we were ending this message when I had to leave because of a Doctrine I said I'll give you money a car transportation to go go for you and the kids if you want to go but I'll not give you one dime a tith to give to the man right CU I ain't going to support a false Doctrine that's right that's right if you think I'm wrong here you put your money in the part you're supporting the wrong Doctrine y right I don't mind talking like that that's right you think I'm wrong I'm not right you putting your money you're supporting the devil then right that's exactly y That's Right how many dollars went out of our pockets to support all the systems of the world and the things right come on right I'm WR come on church he said I would give no Crown might not give a crown but we put a lot of dollars in the plate for them to buy him one right man oh right what about it right yes but I'm having a good honest hearted I'm doing it to help help what helping the Devil he's taking her okay I get to preaching I get down all of preaching I get to meddling on it but listen to Crown go down to number when we're running out of time run down to number uh 11 brother Joe or Brother Anderson we've got these if you want them we received a crown received a Triple Crown but look at this one you can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later he become a pope and then they crowned him he had no Crown to start with but he got a crown later see when they that Spirit became incarnate see he become a man now watch it he's in a man a pope they could left in Doctrine become a man then they could crown it they couldn't do it because it was just a Doctrine see a Doctrine you don't Crown a Doctrine no right you Crown the person that's in got the doctrine incarnate when that Pope came out there he became the Vier of Heaven and Earth in purgatory right yep he became the one who stands between you and God oh he's a good fol yeah he know was going to be full of good people maybe some little lights will be there good people but what are we right see 300 years later he became a pope he didn't start out right with a pope start with that's right and who made him a popee the people amen right like I said a moment ago isn't it odd the pope dies and what do they do the people elect him another one y That's right right right M they elect him another popee they elect him another God right come on right one who stands in for right that's why I don't allow around here we put too much emphasis on this F that's right CU there ain't no F coming out of this thing that's right amen but around them is our Authority amen if what I say is truth then truth is the authority amen did you see what they've done I where a calling names no more I said I'm I'm through with that so I've called names a few times and found out people told me later that I was lying about it so I got where I'm trying my best not to call names but I was talking to a certain person in Israel as we were looking around through the mosque of Omar and seeing the big old rock and the hole and all that bohamad was supposed to went up through and he looked at me and he said brother Dale said one of these days they'll make one of these for brother Brown I said brother they've already got it they've already made it come on before he died they believed he was God right that was that snake in the people right and he was never able to kill that snake that's right cuz it went in the water people right he come out after he died right there's people believe that brother randam was almighty God little less God yeah there's people today believe that brother random is going to come back yeah and preach the things that we don't Now understand well it take him 40 years or 50 know it took him 30 something to preach what he did y way it's messed up now it take him 40 or 50 years that's right that's not a joke that's right true that's what I'm trying to show you I preached what I believe about the tent visions and the things brother around can come back and he can be here with us for 30 40 days but so will the dead Saints amen here he's got 30 40 days to preach to us amen that's right but the Plan of Redemption has already been preached that's right we don't need him here to tell us how to be redeemed no right amen right come on yes I've never denied anything that he said I just try to put it in the right perspective of what I think that's right my dependence is not in the resurrection of a prophet right my dependence was in the resurrection of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago that's right amen and for him to raise in you and I to destroy these doctrines that we have right right Paul wanted to an out resurrection that always bothered me where we talk about that R around and said y he wanted to be raised out he already understood the resurrection Jesus Christ he said he wanted to be raised out of the or the resurrection out of the Dead that was around him y the ones that was trying to deceive him right he wanted raised out of the Dead that was alive around him that's what we all already do you said what Brother D you shouldn't be so Stern let's see if I can quote brother he said you sympathize with the devil you've taken his Doctrine that's right that's a paraphrase quote right I'll be glad to find it sure he say you can't sympathize with the devil right CU if you do y he's got you right mhm oh sure yeah I don't I don't I don't sympathize with it m yeah what do we do right think about this what he's doing to you now that's right amen but what we read these going down to number 12 let me get these we'll just get quick I want to make sure you get the point of what I'm talking about you know the other day we were covering the four stages of the Antichrist we read there the first seal and we find out it's just look like a a three stages I showed you where it's the four stages to get the point the second seal paragraph 184 notice Satan's Trinity same person coming just incarnate from one to the other Rider y mhm that's the way them bugs did PL worm canor worm canor Palm worm Locust caterpillar they ate the bug the bugs ate the tree down that's what he's talking about go read it between there one to the other nickan spiritual Antichrist what spiritual Antichrist Pope false prophet Beast now he's back to the four the Beast is Satan incarnate he's back to the four now let's see if he's keeping his point right that it's the same writer go ahead 13 the four stages of his writer has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist writing has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have to have anymore that's why you don't have any more combat Beast you only got four end of the four seal and there was four living creatures of God to announce the writing as they rode four Beast or four poers look at the next one read this one I want you to notice the four of them notice the off Mark of four other the spiritual mathematics God's God is threes this is four he's in four here first an Christ why second false prophet red third vikers of Heaven and Earth and Purgatory black that's your pope right fourth the Beast fail Satan being kicked out of heaven so he goes through Satan being kicked out first he's Antichrist just to teaching call niol and comes from that to a false prophet it's an antichrist Antichrist is against anything that's against God God's word is against God because the word is God in the beginning was the word word with God the word with made flesh when he had no thing Spirits can't be crowned going down and Pi up the drop to the 16 where we going read it go ahead number 16 notice Nic the Antichrist teaching that started in the days of Paul against God's word Antichrist and he's called again the false prophet which when the teaching become a man he was a prophet to the teaching of the hierarchy of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church the pope was the prophet to the false word and that made him a false prophet the third stag is of Beast a man crown and coming forth in the last days so it looks like he still his holy but look at his word he done said it over here four stages one Antichrist false Prophet Pope Beast Satan incarnate amen listen it's the same Rider yep but that's only the symbol of the riter right right the symbol of the rider is broken right he had no bows the horse was white right some of the church second was what he went from what Antichrist false prophet I talk about second seal now we're still in the first right because it goes from that Antichrist to a prophet because you can't start the second seal until you get a pope we'll pick that up next Wednesday the Lord willing you don't start the second seal until you see the symbols the symbol of the first is a pro it's always the rider right that's a symbol broke we know that no bow no arrows for his bow right right but he's given a crown from the church he's riding yeah the white righteous Church the prophet called it right that he's writing so the symbols is broken the first seal but just because you know that the second seal is the same Rider don't break the symbols right on the second seal that'll have to go we you have to chew on symbol of the second seal of the rider's Al broke the symbol of the third seal of the rider's Al broke the symbol of the for seal the rider off broke the symbols of what's Happening not broke see isn't that way the prophet says watch he saw the symbols of the rider he said I don't know what that seal is he knew the riter was a sign sure but he didn't know the symbols of the second seal he didn't know what the red horse meant the church there's a lot yet to be revealed amen there's plenty in the word to be revealed amen we say what is the first seal Antichrist we say what's the second Antichrist third Antichrist fourth Antichrist you got a symbol of a horse right you're doing pretty good but now what is the second sequ you got a symbol of a red horse yep but remember in your first one he had a crown y given unto him and he went forth what conquering conquering and to conquer under the first seal amen what is the second seal give you a whole week May encourage you to read the S with you see unless it's revealed we don't know I hope you getting the point of what I'm talking about am that this thing is so deceiving until it still has deceived everybody in the world except the Born Again believer and the born in believer was held to the point of not being able to see it until the prophet received it even though you were a born again believer you still didn't know what those seals were no no amen so let's just don't think well we know what the seal what's the symbols come on what's the symbols and we might find out I did and now I know what the second seal is just like I knew then what the first one was but it's been revealed I can see what it is but openly admit no problems I saw the first open I always had trouble with the second or third to see it by Revelation preach it to the letter I challenge you to take the second seal and go back and play it from 79 we don't have 7982 and see if it wouldn't want to say it but I could see it but it wasn't revealed when it's revealed I have no problems brother how can you stand up before people that preach what you believe because that's what I believe that's right amen that's why I preaching amen that's what I believe I believe it's revealed amen and I can see it I can follow it let's stand together but I don't have to worry cuz it ain't up to me to prove it it's up to me to preach it right up to him to back it up amen up to him to back it up go ahead brother we're going to try number 129 in the spiral book 129 anybody have a name have you been we still need to

over say I'm a see church God is want to live in his people he sent us the word hold on to and see Satan ain't nothing but a blood the more we realize that the more we realize that God is real to cut

so low that you couldn't even hardly see anything about that time the Lord come on the scene you know it don't make no difference in how bad you feel it make no difference what happened That's what Satan can't understand he made you sick and you come out Rejoice he brings all kind of afflictions upon him and you rejoice that's a true Christian right Rejoice whenever it's easy to rejoice when everything's going good is it that's right right oh yeah when it starts going bad then you you never question God when everything's going good right you don't never say God why is everything going good no you don't never do that when everything starts going bad you say God what's wrong he said I'm trying to teach you a lesson oh you said yeah but brother Dale you you've never been sick I wouldn't say that but I never let you know that I'm that sick my wife will never know it you won't never know it why because even if I am sick Satan's going to be like old brother Tom used to say yeah brother Tom had a good way of saying it he said you put me in the hospital and I'm going to testify to everybody in the hospital you know he did yeah that's what he done we might not agree with the way he done it but he draw out the seals and everything and give it to people that never even heard might not agree with that but I agree with his statement he said you put me in the hospital I'll testify to everybody in there the little brother over in Jamaica they got to mix up about a a bill of sale that he was by a transmission that somebody else would stole or whatever it happened so they
