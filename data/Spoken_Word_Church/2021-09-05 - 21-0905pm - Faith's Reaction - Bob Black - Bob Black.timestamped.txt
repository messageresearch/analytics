[9:10] watching from home do you believe
[9:12] all things are possible to them that
[9:14] believe
[9:17] and really enjoyed that message this
[9:18] morning i truly believe that was
[9:20] inspired and and
[9:22] it's it's so
[9:23] encouraging to hear a message that falls
[9:26] right in line with the message that i
[9:28] plan to bring this afternoon that just
[9:29] really shows i believe that god has a
[9:32] hand
[9:33] in the message just today and has his
[9:35] hand in it
[9:36] and is watching over us and is mindful
[9:38] of things and and he cares about us amen
[9:42] so this afternoon i just want to speak a
[9:44] little uh a little faith-building
[9:47] message and just kind of build your
[9:48] faith and give you something to edify
[9:50] you and
[9:51] and
[9:52] encourage you along life's road i know
[9:54] like uh so many have said we've got many
[9:57] things to be in prayer about many seems
[9:59] like the the list of prayer requests
[10:01] keeps getting longer and longer and
[10:04] there's there's certainly many things
[10:07] to labor and prayer about and be
[10:09] concerned with but we have a god that
[10:10] can
[10:11] can take care of us
[10:13] and he's ever mindful
[10:16] so this afternoon i want to read from uh
[10:19] first kings chapter 17 but before we go
[10:21] to the scripture let's just go to the
[10:22] author in prayer lord god we're so
[10:24] grateful to be able to gather together
[10:26] and uh
[10:27] even though we're not physically in one
[10:29] place we're gathering around your word
[10:30] lord jesus because we're eagles and
[10:32] we're looking to your word lord god for
[10:34] strength to and we just ask lord that
[10:36] you'll renew our strength this afternoon
[10:38] lord and give us something to help us
[10:40] along life's way lord and i pray god
[10:43] wherever the people are as they listen
[10:44] in and stream and and
[10:47] they'll be encouraged lord of their
[10:48] faith will rise lord jesus rise through
[10:50] whatever gloom that circumstances have
[10:53] have have put upon them lord jesus
[10:55] whatever trials and tribulations they're
[10:57] going through right now oh god i pray
[10:59] lord that you'll just encourage each one
[11:01] as they're listening lord jesus we just
[11:03] bless each one bless each home now bless
[11:05] the little group that's here that's
[11:07] standing by helping the lord things to
[11:09] continue on bless bless all the ones
[11:11] that are listening we pray now in the
[11:13] name of the lord jesus christ
[11:16] so i want to speak this afternoon on on
[11:17] the topic of faith faith's reaction
[11:21] because you know uh when when when
[11:23] things kind of go wrong kind of
[11:25] continuing the thought that brother
[11:26] louise had this morning when things
[11:28] things go wrong and and you're
[11:30] a born-again christian has got it's got
[11:32] the equipment on the inside to respond
[11:34] in a certain way
[11:36] and i believe that's what god is looking
[11:38] for in this hours for for faith to have
[11:40] a right reaction
[11:42] so in first kings chapter 17 verses 1 to
[11:45] 15 it says and elijah the tishbite who
[11:47] was of the inhabitants inhabitants of
[11:49] gilead
[11:50] said unto ahab
[11:52] as the lord god of israel liveth
[11:55] form whom before whom i stand there
[11:57] shall not be dew nor rain
[11:59] these years but according to my word and
[12:02] of course we know this is the first time
[12:04] that elijah just came on the scene uh
[12:06] just seemingly out of nowhere and he
[12:08] comes on the scene uh with
[12:11] just just
[12:12] uh just as you would say hits the ground
[12:15] running and he says rain is not going to
[12:17] fall but until i say call for it and he
[12:20] says and the word of the lord came unto
[12:22] him saying
[12:23] get thee hints and turn thee eastward
[12:25] and hide thyself by the brook cherith
[12:27] that is before jordan and it shall be
[12:29] that thou shalt drink of the brook and i
[12:31] have commanded the ravens to feed thee
[12:33] there
[12:34] so he went and did according unto the
[12:36] word of the lord for he went and dwelt
[12:38] by the brook cherith that is before
[12:40] jordan
[12:41] and the ravens brought him bread and
[12:43] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[12:45] in the evening and he drank of the brook
[12:47] and it came to pass after a while that
[12:49] the brook dried up because there had
[12:51] been no rain in the land
[12:54] and the word of the lord came unto him
[12:56] saying
[12:57] arise get thee to zarephath which
[12:59] belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[13:01] behold i have commanded a widow woman
[13:04] there to sustain thee
[13:06] so he arose and went to zarephath and
[13:09] when he came to the gate of the city
[13:11] behold the widow woman was there
[13:12] gathering of sticks and he called her
[13:15] and said fetch me i pray thee a little
[13:16] water in a vessel that i may drink and
[13:19] as she was going to fetch it he called
[13:21] to her and said bring me i pray thee
[13:23] morsel of bread in thine hand
[13:26] and she said as the lord thy god liveth
[13:28] i have not a cake but a handful of meal
[13:30] and a barrel and a little oil and a
[13:32] cruise
[13:35] and behold i'm gathering two sticks
[13:38] that i may go in and dress it
[13:41] for me and my son that we may eat it and
[13:43] die
[13:45] and elijah said unto her fear not go and
[13:47] do as thou hast said
[13:49] but make me thereof a little cake first
[13:51] and bring it unto me
[13:53] and after make for thee and for thy son
[13:56] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[13:58] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[14:01] neither shall the crews of oil fail
[14:03] until the day that the lord sendeth the
[14:05] rain upon the earth
[14:07] and she went and did according to the
[14:08] saying of elijah and she and he and her
[14:11] house did eat many days and the barrel
[14:14] of meal wasted not
[14:16] neither did the crews of oil fail
[14:18] according to the word of the lord which
[14:20] he spake by elijah
[14:22] you may be seated the lord had his
[14:23] blessing to the reading of the word
[14:27] now in this story this is this the story
[14:29] is a story of of of of something
[14:32] happening a little story being woven in
[14:34] the time of great gloom and heartache
[14:36] and and depression and sadness with this
[14:38] little woman you you you really you
[14:41] really have to look at it from the
[14:42] perspective of elijah and this little
[14:44] widow woman elijah who was sitting up
[14:46] there and uh maybe thinking that nobody
[14:49] nobody was there and in the time that
[14:51] this story was was
[14:54] is relayed nobody was responding to his
[14:56] message and nobody was listening to him
[14:58] maybe he'd get down and out you know as
[15:01] the scripture talks about how that at
[15:02] one point he came to the to the place
[15:04] where he thought nope uh you know god
[15:06] had to show him that there's seven
[15:07] thousand still left that believe that
[15:09] believe your message
[15:11] and he's up there and he's being fed uh
[15:13] you know he's not holding camp meetings
[15:15] he's not holding youth revival he's up
[15:17] there alone in the mountains sitting by
[15:18] the brook and god's feeding him uh he
[15:21] sends the sins of the ravens to feed him
[15:23] and down that way down in that in that
[15:25] city there's a little widow woman and
[15:27] she's also going through her own trials
[15:29] and she's going through a place where
[15:31] you know her husband has passed away and
[15:33] and now the food is running out and
[15:35] she's coming to a place where you know
[15:37] she didn't have maybe a shotgun to
[15:38] defend their home when all of the all
[15:40] the people would come by to pillage her
[15:42] her her little dwelling place and she's
[15:44] living there like you know all the all
[15:45] the trials that a widow woman would go
[15:47] through
[15:48] any day any you know it in the middle
[15:50] east today or wherever wherever you
[15:52] would be a widow woman it would have
[15:55] would have trials and so
[15:58] she's she's going through a gloomy place
[16:01] and you you see sometimes sometimes we
[16:03] like brother brown said sometimes we get
[16:05] to a place where we don't really have
[16:07] the right kind of confidence that we
[16:09] shouldn't go in god
[16:10] we need to we need to be able to come we
[16:13] need to be able to have confidence that
[16:15] that the the word that we've heard is
[16:17] actually going to accomplish what it
[16:19] says it will do and so god allows us he
[16:22] actually allows us to go through
[16:23] situations and go through trials to kind
[16:26] of to put our faith to a test to to
[16:29] cause that to cause faith to have a
[16:31] reaction
[16:32] you know brother brown points out he
[16:33] says that you know hebrews 13 8 says
[16:35] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[16:38] today and forever so as we look through
[16:40] all these stories and examine all the
[16:42] stories of the old testament on into the
[16:43] new testament you can be assured that if
[16:45] god ever reacted if you ever did
[16:47] something
[16:49] one way
[16:50] forevermore he's going to do he's going
[16:53] to respond the exact same way his
[16:55] behavior his character his attributes is
[16:57] going to is going to be unchanging and
[16:59] so if he ever responded to someone who
[17:02] reached out to him in faith who stood
[17:04] there steadfastly on god's word who
[17:07] stood steadfastly believing in god's
[17:09] word if he ever did that once he'll do
[17:11] it the same way forevermore i what a
[17:13] confidence that should be to us in this
[17:15] hour that
[17:16] if we'll come with the same kind of
[17:18] faith that elijah had and the same kind
[17:20] of faith that the widow of zarephath had
[17:22] then we'll get the same results that god
[17:25] will respond because we come in faith
[17:27] believing in his word it feel approached
[17:29] in faith and brother branham he would
[17:31] equate it to like like
[17:32] electricity if you can if you can
[17:34] connect the wires together then you're
[17:36] going to have light you can if you flip
[17:38] the light switch on then you're going to
[17:40] have light and so if you can follow the
[17:42] fall of the plan follow that the
[17:45] that that plan of faith that to be able
[17:48] to connect the power switch to the
[17:50] source and what we've got here is we
[17:52] we've actually that's actually what the
[17:54] gospel is the gospel is the connecting
[17:56] force between our earthly humanity and
[18:00] between the supernatural so when we
[18:02] listen to the gospel when we hear the
[18:03] word preached and within our heart we
[18:06] say well i believe that's got to be true
[18:08] when you hear the preaching of the
[18:09] gospel and something within you just
[18:11] echoes that's got to be true it's
[18:13] actually connecting you and your little
[18:15] humanity walking around here in flesh
[18:17] it's connecting you up to the
[18:18] supernatural and that connecting that's
[18:21] that's actually it's connecting you to
[18:23] the source of the supernatural where
[18:25] where you can begin to see something
[18:26] begin to take place in your life
[18:28] something began to take place in this
[18:30] little widow woman's life something
[18:32] began to take place in elijah's life
[18:34] where he was being fed and directed by
[18:36] god and moved down to where he could he
[18:39] could minister to this little widow
[18:40] woman's need and brother branham he
[18:42] begins to talk about how you look at
[18:44] this situation that to maybe one of the
[18:46] most gloomiest maybe the one
[18:49] most depressing situations in the bible
[18:51] a situation of starvation where this
[18:53] little woman had nothing she was down to
[18:56] the last little bit of oil the last
[18:58] little bit of meal she had nothing left
[19:00] one night of food left and she began to
[19:03] get really serious
[19:05] brother brown he begins to describe it
[19:07] he says it must have been a dreadful
[19:08] morning so hot and dusty and people was
[19:11] in the street starving let's just kind
[19:13] of paint a picture in your mind of what
[19:15] the situation there's that woman in her
[19:17] home and she's got one little bit of
[19:19] meal left and one little bit of oil left
[19:21] and people outside of her home laying in
[19:23] the street starving actually dying in
[19:25] the street maybe scream in one place he
[19:27] said screaming and he said the earth was
[19:29] so hot it was ready to burn and that
[19:31] just paints a picture of something just
[19:33] a really dismal terrible looking
[19:35] situation and he said and this was the
[19:38] reflection this natural scene that where
[19:41] maybe you got in your mind now was a
[19:43] reflection of something spiritual it was
[19:46] a reflection of their sins and their
[19:48] moral decay or reflection of the the
[19:50] moral spiritual situation of the of the
[19:53] people of that day and he said ahab was
[19:56] reigning in israel at that time and he
[19:58] was the wickedness of all the kings of
[20:00] israel let's examine why he was the
[20:03] wickedest of all the kings of israel
[20:04] because brother rahm said there had he
[20:06] said there had been no king as wicked as
[20:08] they have being taught and no better so
[20:11] now you've got a king that he was
[20:13] actually instructed in the right way to
[20:15] live he was instructed and how he should
[20:18] do and how he should behave and how he
[20:20] should believe and what the truth was
[20:22] but yeah he laid it to the side and said
[20:24] i'm going to go my own way i'm going to
[20:26] marry jezebel i'm going to do despite
[20:28] all of the teaching that i've had i'm
[20:30] going to go and that you see that began
[20:32] to pile up and made him the most wicked
[20:34] of all the kings of israel now you kind
[20:36] of put put put in this
[20:38] compare that today to the situation that
[20:40] we're living in today looking around at
[20:43] america who's got this background of a
[20:45] christian supposedly a christian country
[20:47] with the backgrounds of pilgrims trying
[20:49] to come to america to to escape the
[20:51] oppression of the roman catholic church
[20:53] and the church of england coming to
[20:54] america for religious freedom so that
[20:56] they could so that they could have have
[20:58] freedom of religion
[21:00] pull the pull the mic down
[21:03] here let me let me know if that if y'all
[21:05] can't hear me okay
[21:07] comparing comparing
[21:09] ahab then to to the to america now and
[21:13] he said you see america has been taught
[21:15] america has heard the gospel but they've
[21:17] rejected it and that makes them the most
[21:20] wicked the most heart
[21:22] you think about how out of this
[21:24] wickedness and out of this like i was
[21:26] preaching last sunday how out of this
[21:28] the most wicked the most darkest age the
[21:31] out of that god has raised up a little
[21:33] bride to be an example to be a light to
[21:36] the world but what made it so what makes
[21:38] it so wicked is because they have heard
[21:40] the truth they've heard that
[21:42] you think of all the all the preachers
[21:44] the great preachers that have risen up
[21:46] billy graham and oral roberts and
[21:47] brother random and billy sunday and all
[21:49] the way down and they yeah
[21:51] and they've turned it down
[21:53] he said being tall and no better he
[21:55] failed not to continue to displease god
[21:57] and everything that he did although he
[22:00] had a great military system and the
[22:03] people had become very prosperous under
[22:05] his reign but yet you cannot displease
[22:08] god and expect to get by very long you
[22:11] can't displease god and expect to get by
[22:13] very long but they had it they see they
[22:15] had a great military system and the
[22:17] people had become very prosperous under
[22:19] this reign exactly echoing exactly
[22:22] typing exactly what america has become
[22:24] now and he said see in this wedding
[22:26] instead of marrying among his own people
[22:29] he went over and married a sinner an
[22:31] idolater worshipper of idols because you
[22:34] see what abe ahab was not looking for
[22:36] character he was looking he was looking
[22:38] on the outward he was looking for
[22:40] something on the outside
[22:41] any real true believer any real true
[22:44] child of god is going to look for
[22:45] character instead of instead of
[22:47] something that just fades away instead
[22:49] of something that that fades away over
[22:51] time
[22:52] sooner or later you know you look at a
[22:54] young couple getting married and sooner
[22:56] or later the the flesh is going to begin
[22:58] to get wrinkled and the hairs are going
[23:00] to begin to turn gray and all the things
[23:03] that maybe that you value so highly when
[23:05] you're young
[23:06] i'm just speaking frankly now all those
[23:09] things will begin to fade away but
[23:10] there's something on that on the inside
[23:12] that's worth more than all that outward
[23:15] appearance that's what a real true
[23:17] believer is going to look for for
[23:18] character on the inside character
[23:20] characters will carry characters what'll
[23:23] keep a little family together character
[23:25] where you put god first and you you're
[23:27] not so worried about all of the temporal
[23:29] pleasures and all the all that how much
[23:31] money you got and whether you got a big
[23:33] boat or a big a big truck or something
[23:34] to drive but character something on the
[23:37] inside and that's what god is interested
[23:39] too god is interested in getting a bride
[23:41] for himself that's got character maybe
[23:44] maybe god's bride is is pulled out from
[23:47] all the different place all the hedges
[23:48] and byways people that have bad
[23:50] backgrounds and people with weak weak
[23:53] experiences you know life life life
[23:56] things that they've come out of but yet
[23:58] god will take that all together and and
[24:00] build himself a bride that's got real
[24:03] character real godly character because
[24:05] that's what that's what god is after and
[24:07] he said that brother brown really lays
[24:09] at home he said no believer should ever
[24:11] marry an unbeliever he talked about ahab
[24:13] and jezebel now look at what ahab was
[24:15] interested in he was interested in in a
[24:18] painted face jezebel somebody that
[24:20] didn't have real the real true uh or
[24:23] we'll say gospel character of that
[24:25] somebody that was willing to listen to
[24:27] the word for their day and adhere to it
[24:30] to wear long hair and dress and want to
[24:32] want to do what's right he said no
[24:34] believer should ever marry an unbeliever
[24:36] under no circumstances should always
[24:39] marry believers but ahab had done this
[24:41] evil thing and no doubt but what jezebel
[24:44] was a beautiful woman and he'd fell for
[24:47] what she looked like in the stead of
[24:49] what she was
[24:51] so many people make that same mistake to
[24:54] this day so many people get so called up
[24:57] and and have an unequally yoked
[24:59] relationship you know we were talking
[25:01] about that the other day just kind of
[25:03] sitting around
[25:04] because look look how ahab if if ahab
[25:06] would have been trying to to live live
[25:09] the real gospel way
[25:10] with with uh mary to jezebel who wanted
[25:13] none of that how could they how could
[25:15] they walk together how can even you know
[25:17] in the world
[25:19] how could how could a buddhist and a and
[25:20] a catholic walk together they're always
[25:23] going to be at odds maybe one wants to
[25:25] homeschool their kids and one wants to
[25:28] one wants to send them to the to the the
[25:30] to the nun school or something that
[25:32] they're always going to be at odds with
[25:34] one another you know even even in a good
[25:36] christian marriage there's always going
[25:38] to be there's going to be something that
[25:40] you kind of have have a little tension
[25:42] about what how your approach to home
[25:43] school or whether you whether you're
[25:45] going to send your kids to public school
[25:47] but you can't you can't walk together
[25:49] unless you're in agreement so that's why
[25:51] a lot of these things that that are in
[25:53] the bible that brother man taught us
[25:54] told us about are not there just to make
[25:57] us give us something to great at to give
[25:59] us something to be at odds with one
[26:00] another but they're actually there to to
[26:02] give us as a benefit for us something to
[26:05] help us and it will be a help to you
[26:07] young people and
[26:09] if you if you'll really consider these
[26:11] things to that you want to marry
[26:12] somebody that believes the same way that
[26:14] you do that walks the same way so that
[26:16] you can be yoked up with them so that
[26:18] you won't it will remove a lot of the
[26:21] strife and the struggles of life if
[26:23] you'll follow the advice that brother
[26:25] branham has given here that that the
[26:27] word gives here and he said ahab the
[26:29] most wicked king of israel because he
[26:32] married an adulterer he was the most
[26:34] wicked king of israel because he married
[26:36] an idolater despite knowing better
[26:39] and brother ram goes on he said it's a
[26:41] very picture of our country today we
[26:43] have fallen under the popular demand we
[26:46] might we may not think that we're idle
[26:48] worshippers but we are and the
[26:50] government endorses it people today are
[26:53] idle worshipers
[26:55] some of them worship movie stars for
[26:57] idols some worship money for idols and
[26:59] some worship television stars as idols
[27:02] but all that you put before god as an
[27:04] idol let it be whatever it may be and
[27:07] you i think that's so true if you look
[27:09] around today and see how everybody has
[27:12] put some so many things in front of god
[27:15] they'll put they'll put facebook and
[27:16] instagram before god they would rather
[27:18] have a nice looking picture they'd
[27:20] rather they'd rather spend more time
[27:22] posting pictures about how good their
[27:23] food looks or where they went been on
[27:25] vacation than actually worrying about
[27:27] the things of god i i would even say
[27:29] today we're more worried about politics
[27:32] and whether somebody takes a knee at a
[27:34] football game then whether we're
[27:35] actually adhering to the word of god and
[27:37] doing what god's word says we're more
[27:40] more worried about who the president is
[27:42] and and and those kind of things that we
[27:44] are about god's word
[27:46] brother rem said even to satan that
[27:48] great adversary is such a smart one
[27:51] until he even put sometimes the church
[27:53] before god he said you might have a
[27:55] great church it might be a great bill in
[27:57] there it might be a great denomination
[27:59] and again it might be a great
[28:01] congregation but let nothing come before
[28:04] god in your heart if you put anything
[28:06] before god in your heart you are an idol
[28:09] worshiper
[28:10] you know brother rahm said in one place
[28:12] he said our modern trend today fallen
[28:15] away from the things of god and has
[28:16] brought the world to it now listen to
[28:18] what he said one of the greatest
[28:20] idolatries that we have is he said to
[28:22] one of the greatest idolatries that we
[28:25] have and that is idleness like you could
[28:28] you imagine that idleness with just
[28:30] sitting around not willing to do nothing
[28:33] would be one of the greatest idolatries
[28:35] something that you would put before god
[28:37] willing to just just
[28:40] the spirit of the nation the spirit of
[28:42] the age it's just a spirit of slightness
[28:45] not wanting to put your hand to the plow
[28:47] not wanting to do nothing not people not
[28:49] wanting to go to church not wanting to
[28:50] pick up their bible not wanting to spend
[28:52] time in prayer not wanting to do nothing
[28:54] just idle around and let let the
[28:56] preacher do all the living for god let
[28:58] the song leaders or whatever do all the
[29:00] living for god but just isle around and
[29:03] not do nothing for god
[29:05] he said great is the iniquity of the
[29:07] people today making plenty of money i
[29:10] think that god's blessing us because
[29:12] he's prospered us he said that's no sign
[29:14] of god's blessing
[29:16] not at all prosperity is no sign of you
[29:18] know
[29:20] you you examine this story where elijah
[29:22] went down to this little whittle of his
[29:24] hair path and she might be one of the
[29:25] greatest blessed most blessed people in
[29:28] the scripture but yet she had nothing
[29:30] she had nothing and we look around and
[29:32] we we try to be like oh you know listen
[29:34] to all these prosperity preachers
[29:36] that'll tell you well if you'll pay your
[29:38] tithes and you can have a yacht or you
[29:39] can get promoted and you can have all
[29:41] these things but that is not the gospel
[29:44] that's not what the gospel is about the
[29:46] gospel is about somebody that don't have
[29:48] nothing but yet they got god in their
[29:50] heart they don't have they don't have
[29:52] nothing but they've given their whole
[29:53] life to god they've given him
[29:56] a preacher that'll preach the gospel
[29:58] whether or not he's preaching to a fence
[30:00] post whether or not he's on the back
[30:01] side of the desert somewhere and with
[30:03] nobody to listen to
[30:05] that's what the gospel is about you know
[30:08] brother the bible says in deuteronomy
[30:10] chapter 6 verse 5 it says thou shalt
[30:12] love the lord that's the firs that's
[30:14] what jesus said the greatest commandment
[30:16] is thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[30:18] all thine heart and with all thy soul
[30:21] and all thy might in other words god
[30:23] wants you to give everything like
[30:25] brother louise was talking about this
[30:26] morning he's not god's not so care so
[30:29] much and care about even your body but
[30:31] he wants that heart he wants you to love
[30:33] him with all your heart with all your
[30:36] soul with everything that you've got to
[30:38] give it all to him
[30:40] and yet yes that nation that ahab's
[30:42] nation that the nation that he was the
[30:44] king of this nation that that that used
[30:47] to be a christian nation that used to
[30:49] put god first they came over to america
[30:52] because they were trying to serve god
[30:53] and wanted freedom of religion has
[30:55] become a religious nation that nation
[30:58] was a religious nation and this nation
[31:00] is a religious nation what does religion
[31:02] mean is mean you're trying to cover up
[31:04] that you're trying to cover up what you
[31:06] know is flawed with something else
[31:09] something other than the blood of jesus
[31:11] christ
[31:12] something else you're trying to cover up
[31:14] something that down on the inside that's
[31:16] crooked that's flawed that's messed up
[31:20] he said these people knew that they
[31:22] wasn't spiritual like they used to be
[31:24] under the reigns of other kings and they
[31:26] thought just because there was a
[31:28] religious nation that everything would
[31:30] be all right and that's the way we have
[31:32] come to that place also we think that
[31:35] because we got an american flag flying
[31:37] behind us so we go to like a patriotic
[31:40] thing
[31:41] my wife was she went with with my
[31:43] daughter to the little marching man
[31:44] thing on friday that she's in and she
[31:46] was she kind of observed when they began
[31:48] to when they had to prayer it's like
[31:50] everybody just glossed over that
[31:52] disrespectful and talking and stuff but
[31:54] when they said the pledge of allegiance
[31:57] certainly everybody got up and they put
[31:58] their hand over their heart you see it's
[32:01] backwards everybody's giving more
[32:02] prevalence to the pain but the politics
[32:05] and the
[32:06] who's the president and that kind of
[32:07] thing and they don't care about god
[32:09] anymore why because they become a
[32:10] religious nation covering up their filth
[32:13] and their their hatefulness and their uh
[32:16] their own temperance and every ungodly
[32:18] thing with what appears to be religious
[32:21] religion is trying to cover something up
[32:23] you remember brother brown talked about
[32:25] how adam and eve when they first seen
[32:27] they ran into the bushes and they
[32:28] covered up their unbelief they tried to
[32:30] cover it up with fig leaves they tried
[32:32] to make their own little religion
[32:36] you know the word iniquity if you'll go
[32:39] examine that in the bible it actually
[32:41] says the crooked it comes from the greek
[32:43] word avon avon which means the crooked
[32:46] the crooked behavior and its
[32:48] consequences something down on the
[32:50] inside that's crooked and religion is
[32:52] trying to cover that crookedness up with
[32:55] a with a false covering
[32:57] we don't need no more religion we need
[32:59] something real we need something genuine
[33:02] when you hang around people that just
[33:04] all they know is their denominational
[33:06] covering
[33:07] thank god that we've got a real covering
[33:09] that covers us over we've got the real
[33:12] gospel we've got the blood of the lamb
[33:13] to cover us over
[33:15] you you examine it all down through the
[33:17] scriptures and you look at the life of
[33:19] balaam and cain and esau and judas and
[33:22] then ahab and they were all religious
[33:24] they were all trying to cover up their
[33:26] crookedness down on the inside the crook
[33:28] itself they're
[33:30] trying to believe but could not believe
[33:32] because they were just being religious
[33:34] brother brahman said in the unpardonable
[33:36] sin he said if you do those things the
[33:38] bible said if you love the world or the
[33:41] things of the world the love of god
[33:43] isn't even in you in other words if your
[33:44] heart down on the inside is not right
[33:47] something down on the inside of it's
[33:49] crooked you need something to straighten
[33:51] it out he said you're only just
[33:53] religious and never had any salvation
[33:56] religious is a covering but salvation is
[33:59] freedom
[34:00] salvation uncovers that's right
[34:02] salvation uncovered that shows what you
[34:05] are it shows what you really are that's
[34:07] what thank god for real true genuine
[34:10] believers who can be what they are who
[34:12] they don't have to cover up with if
[34:14] they're having a great disagreement with
[34:15] their spouse they can just be genuine
[34:18] they could just be real but i i thank
[34:20] god for real believers that could show
[34:22] their spouse what's on their phone they
[34:24] don't have to cover it up they could
[34:26] show their spouse what's in their bank
[34:27] account real genuine they could talk
[34:30] their pastor about what's on their heart
[34:32] they could talk to one another with real
[34:34] genuineness without trying to cover
[34:36] something up with some kind of fake
[34:38] religion
[34:39] salvation uncovers and shows what you
[34:41] are brother said he said that's true now
[34:44] because that we do things wrong is
[34:46] because we do not believe
[34:49] he said what religion is one thing
[34:52] religion is one thing and salvation's
[34:55] another religion is a covering and
[34:57] salvation is the gift of god you see why
[34:59] we don't major on religion we're not
[35:01] just a bunch of religious people but
[35:03] we've got a real genuine covering of the
[35:06] baptism in the holy ghost we've got to
[35:08] risk something real that makes us
[35:10] genuine praise god we've got something
[35:12] real
[35:15] the only true covering is his
[35:17] righteousness that's why psalm chapter
[35:19] 32 says i acknowledge my sin unto thee
[35:22] and my iniquity have no i not hid i said
[35:25] i'll confess my transgressions unto the
[35:27] lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of
[35:30] my sin that's how you get rid of
[35:32] iniquity is being genuine with god
[35:34] that's how you get rid of sin as being
[35:36] genuine being real with god and saying
[35:38] i've done something wrong and you lay it
[35:40] before him and let him take care of it
[35:43] take it away from you he'll he'll he'll
[35:45] get rid of it for you he'll cover it
[35:47] over with his blood and that's the only
[35:50] true covering it's his righteousness
[35:54] brother ram said in the sign of the time
[35:56] he said wade in the balance and found
[35:58] wanting a christian nation rock and roll
[36:01] all this ungodly stuff that we're having
[36:03] where you waited comparing us comparing
[36:06] america with babylon he said they're not
[36:08] having a form of godliness but denying
[36:11] the power thereof from such turn away oh
[36:14] they was religious they called their
[36:16] bishops and cardinals and all they were
[36:18] religious
[36:19] but the wrong kind of religion
[36:22] religion means a covering you might be
[36:24] covered by the baptist church
[36:26] presbyterian methodist pentecostal you
[36:29] got to be covered by the blood the blood
[36:31] of the lord jesus that's the original
[36:34] price these signs shall follow them that
[36:36] believe christ is here that's the kind
[36:39] of covering that we've got this
[36:40] afternoon friends no matter what kind of
[36:43] gloom is going through your life no
[36:45] matter what kind of story the devil's
[36:46] trying to tell you we've got a covering
[36:49] we've got an atonement we've got a
[36:51] sacrifice
[36:52] he said i met we're america resting upon
[36:55] what our forefathers did and what upon
[36:58] our great founders of our churches what
[37:00] their great sacrifice was the god which
[37:02] is all right and so much appreciated but
[37:05] we cannot draw salvation from what they
[37:07] did it's come to the place in our
[37:09] country until in the midst of the most
[37:11] spiritual people that we have you go to
[37:14] spiritual men and women that you find in
[37:17] their heart that there's something like
[37:19] now listen if you go back and listen to
[37:21] this sermon be certain of god
[37:24] and listen to the way that brother and
[37:26] preach this it's like he's grieving it's
[37:27] like the people that he thought were
[37:29] real genuine he began to go to them what
[37:32] was he finding out that something was
[37:34] lacking on the inside of their heart
[37:36] down on the inside something was still
[37:38] crooked something wasn't genuine and he
[37:40] said and the man that i thought was the
[37:42] colonel yet i found that they're putting
[37:44] emphasis upon temporal things going
[37:47] around and saying god gives me the
[37:49] biggest sow and so god that's not
[37:52] genuine if you look to the things of the
[37:54] world how much money you've got how much
[37:56] money you can heap up to yourself or how
[37:58] big your church is or all these things
[38:00] that are temporal he said you're
[38:02] bluffing
[38:04] you're bluffing
[38:07] god wants somebody to be genuine
[38:09] just be genuine and be real
[38:14] that's why young ladies just be real
[38:16] genuine on facebook
[38:18] young me and be genuine when you put
[38:20] your pictures on instagram if you want
[38:22] to attract somebody that's real and be
[38:25] genuine real and genuine be real and
[38:27] genuine out there don't be fake
[38:30] christian me and the ladies you don't
[38:32] have to advertise on facebook you don't
[38:34] have to advertise on something all you
[38:36] got to do is put yourself on display
[38:38] like esther did with your character your
[38:40] character is what a really godly man or
[38:43] woman wants characters what what
[38:46] characters what the world wants to see
[38:48] they're looking for something genuine
[38:51] just be yourself
[38:53] jezebel couldn't be herself she wanted
[38:55] to cover up her face with all that paint
[38:57] and makeup she threw herself flirting
[38:59] after yahoo and yeah he said throw her
[39:01] out of the window and he rolled over
[39:03] with his chariot why because j yahoo
[39:05] wanted something genuine god wants
[39:08] something genuine elijah wants something
[39:10] genuine god wants something genuine
[39:13] today
[39:15] he said sometimes faith will do great
[39:17] miracles and still doesn't come from a
[39:19] spiritual heart it's the heart that
[39:22] matters he said do not our lord say many
[39:25] will come to me that day say have not i
[39:27] did this and that in your name and i
[39:29] will confess to them depart from me you
[39:31] workers of iniquity because god wants to
[39:34] change your heart it doesn't matter how
[39:36] religious you are and how much you go
[39:38] through the religious acts and how much
[39:40] you go to even go to church and sit in
[39:42] the pew and act very religious but he
[39:44] wants something genuine that god can
[39:47] make you genuine a real genuine
[39:50] christian a real genuine son or daughter
[39:52] of god if you'll let him and he said
[39:55] what we need today to be spiritual let's
[39:58] listen to the brother brahma's recipe he
[40:00] said what we need today to be spiritual
[40:03] is a person that will humble themselves
[40:05] before god
[40:06] if they haven't got a penny and we'll
[40:08] pray till thy spirit within them is
[40:10] satisfied with the goodness of god and a
[40:13] revival takes place on the inside of
[40:15] their heart that changes their attitudes
[40:17] and atmosphere that they live in
[40:23] you realize what he's saying
[40:25] god what we need today to be spiritual
[40:27] is to realize when there's something
[40:29] lacking in our lives something that we
[40:32] we need to humble ourselves and get down
[40:34] with god it doesn't matter if you don't
[40:36] have a penny if you don't have nothing
[40:37] to your name but if you'll get serious
[40:40] with that that's why i still believe in
[40:42] prayer i was listening to an evangelist
[40:44] preaching one recently and he began to
[40:46] talk about how people don't believe in
[40:48] prayer anymore but i believe in prayer
[40:50] because i still believe in repentance i
[40:52] still believe in humbling before
[40:54] yourself before and almighty god i still
[40:56] believe in
[40:57] drawing yourself close to god and
[41:00] kneeling before him and prostrating
[41:02] yourself before him and saying god i
[41:03] need something that the world can't give
[41:06] me the world can't give it to me i need
[41:08] you to give something to me
[41:10] he said elijah know that a holy god
[41:12] could not be satisfied with modern
[41:14] trends of an unholy religion he said god
[41:17] will never be pleased outside of an
[41:19] entire sanctified life before him
[41:22] god won't be satisfied until the human
[41:24] soul becomes the sanctified on the altar
[41:27] of god
[41:28] consecrated for the works of god
[41:31] and listen he said you don't find that
[41:32] no more you don't find that no more
[41:35] isn't that why
[41:37] when the seven church ages were drawn
[41:38] out on the back of the of the church
[41:40] there the last church age was dark and
[41:42] he said i left a little bit of light but
[41:44] why because you don't find it no more
[41:46] you don't find people that are real
[41:48] genuine anymore even in the uh
[41:51] all the church world everybody's just
[41:53] kind of covering themselves over with
[41:54] little religious covering but he said
[41:57] god found a poor little widow woman that
[42:00] was pleasing to him and he found that
[42:02] woman in the midst of gloom and despair
[42:04] in the midst of darkest in the darkest
[42:06] hour where she had no food she had no
[42:09] hope all her hopes was gone all the only
[42:12] hope she had left was her faith in a god
[42:16] that's the same yesterday today and
[42:18] forever
[42:20] the bible brother brown said this
[42:22] gentile woman
[42:24] had been chosen
[42:25] chosen to entertain god's prophet now
[42:28] you think about that this little woman
[42:30] in the midst of all this gloom and
[42:31] despair in her home where she didn't
[42:33] have anything any fancy furniture to
[42:35] entertain god's prophet but that's right
[42:38] where god god sent his word to that
[42:40] little home that little home that might
[42:42] have been overlooked by all the big
[42:44] churches of the day overlooked by all
[42:46] the great people of the day
[42:47] but he said this woman must have been of
[42:50] the caliber of elijah now you think that
[42:53] that woman must have been in the caliber
[42:55] of elijah now you think of somebody in
[42:57] this day that would hear the same that
[43:00] hear the message of the elijah that
[43:02] we've heard that he's
[43:04] that's what he's speaking of you are of
[43:06] the same caliber of elijah if you're a
[43:09] believer sitting here tonight listening
[43:11] in on the on the airways because being
[43:13] of the believer type he said because
[43:16] usually your action shows what you are
[43:18] she had been chosen to entertain god's
[43:21] prophet she was a gentile
[43:24] a gentile not a jew
[43:28] and now we've got gentiles
[43:30] that are sitting in listening in tonight
[43:32] that have heard the message of elijah of
[43:35] our day and they are of that same kind
[43:37] of caliber the same caliber that elijah
[43:39] was
[43:40] god would not have called her he said if
[43:42] she hadn't have been a worthy one to
[43:45] entertain god's prophet for he would
[43:47] have never sent his prophet to a house
[43:49] that was unworthy what made her worthy i
[43:52] want to ask you tonight while you're
[43:53] listening in sit maybe sitting in your
[43:55] gloom praying for somebody that might be
[43:58] in the hospital what made her worthy is
[44:00] the same thing that makes you worthy to
[44:02] hear the message of elijah is because
[44:05] you are a believer she believed the word
[44:08] of god and your belief in the word of
[44:10] god we believe we believe in the bad
[44:12] times and the good times we believe when
[44:15] it's gloomy when it's dark outside we
[44:17] believe when it's shining light we
[44:19] believe because that is what we do we
[44:21] are the light believers he said god
[44:23] surely went to a believer of the same
[44:26] nature of elijah
[44:30] you see that's why the word that's why
[44:32] the word came to your hope
[44:34] that's why the word came to your home
[44:35] and you believed that you heard it
[44:37] that's why the lord is visiting your
[44:39] home tonight this afternoon
[44:41] because you're a believer
[44:44] you've opened up your heart you've
[44:46] opened up the door to your home and you
[44:47] said i will receive this word just like
[44:50] she accepted the word of the lord when
[44:52] it came walking by
[44:53] you are a believer and you have the same
[44:56] caliber of the elijah prophet of this
[44:58] day
[45:00] if you if you don't get nothing else out
[45:02] of this message you're the same caliber
[45:04] you're the same type you're the same we
[45:08] put
[45:10] brother ram said no doubt she'd pray
[45:12] night after night
[45:13] all night and then she begins to see
[45:15] that mule bearer going down down
[45:18] see that milward going down look at that
[45:21] gloom and despair you compare that
[45:24] tonight this afternoon with looking
[45:26] around and seeing people getting hooked
[45:28] up on ventilators and laying in the
[45:30] hospital and wondering seeing people
[45:32] dying left to right but yes maybe you
[45:34] you see you're looking at the mill going
[45:36] down down but yet she was still a
[45:38] believer and we're still i'm still a
[45:41] believer i know that god is still able
[45:44] god still cares about you and he said
[45:46] the oil was just a good spoonful left in
[45:49] the little container just that much oil
[45:52] and that much meal lay between her and
[45:55] death
[45:56] it looked like all hopes was gone
[46:01] excuse me
[46:03] you see
[46:05] in the midst
[46:06] in the midst of that gloom and despair
[46:09] a story was being woven a testimony was
[46:12] being told and now and it looks like in
[46:14] the mid maybe in the midst of your gloom
[46:16] and your despair a story is being woven
[46:19] a testimony you're going to come out the
[46:20] other side with something that you can
[46:22] tell others about it looked like all
[46:24] hopes was gone but yet god still cares
[46:27] he said she must have got real sincere
[46:30] about her prayers you let that strike
[46:32] your home it'll be a little more sincere
[46:34] than we are this morning when we know
[46:36] that death lays at the door and he said
[46:39] you know it's a strange
[46:40] thing may god let this soak into every
[46:43] one of you if you never hear me preach
[46:45] again this is brother branham's words he
[46:47] said let this be a message
[46:49] it's strange
[46:51] most strange
[46:52] that sometimes
[46:54] that god does things
[46:56] that way
[46:58] now could you imagine that
[47:00] that now just put that in your head that
[47:03] god does not raise children like we do
[47:05] he actually well maybe he's saying he'll
[47:08] sometimes he'll allow things to get real
[47:10] bad he'll allow people at work to to get
[47:13] on you he'll allow people at your church
[47:15] to to maybe not be for your friends or
[47:17] maybe not treat you the way that you
[47:19] expect he'll allow ministers to not get
[47:22] invited to preach at the places that
[47:23] they want to preach he'll allow things
[47:25] to get real gloomy and real dark to
[47:27] maybe the sickness to come in why
[47:29] because he's looking for faith reaction
[47:32] with faith state when you've got the
[47:34] good man in the house there at the door
[47:36] it's you've got something there that
[47:38] will react right to fate to to bad times
[47:40] to the gloominess to the darkness some
[47:43] faith with faith speaks it it speaks
[47:46] assurance it knows he said when we have
[47:49] confessed our sins and met every
[47:51] requirement that god requires we
[47:53] believed on god we've confessed our sins
[47:56] and we made all the wrongs that we have
[47:58] did right done everything that we know
[48:00] how to do every requirement that god had
[48:03] made or asked we have met that
[48:05] requirement and let yet he lays silent
[48:08] he just won't answer us
[48:10] when he's silent when it looks like he's
[48:13] not answering that's when faith goes to
[48:15] work he wants to see you believe he
[48:18] wants to see you say i don't care if
[48:21] it doesn't look like i'm getting an
[48:22] answer from god right now i don't care
[48:25] what circumstance to say but yet my
[48:27] faith something down on the inside is
[48:30] stronger than all the circumstances is
[48:32] holding on and he said when i went back
[48:34] and traced my life and turned over every
[48:36] stone and i'd find that i did something
[48:39] wrong i'd go confess it and say lord god
[48:42] i'll make it right and go do so
[48:44] he's saying what he's when he's got all
[48:46] the background tied it up listen to what
[48:48] he's saying then come back again and say
[48:51] now lord thou art god you'll answer me
[48:54] surely i met every request that you
[48:56] required me to do and every requirement
[48:59] i've met it and still he won't move
[49:02] seems to stop silent
[49:05] what are you gonna do when god doesn't
[49:07] answer back
[49:08] what are you gonna do when it looks like
[49:10] thing gloom is closing in i'll tell you
[49:13] what i'm gonna do i'm gonna believe i'm
[49:15] going to keep believing
[49:16] he said that's when you've got to be
[49:19] sure that he is god
[49:21] don't be discouraged the only thing is
[49:24] that in your heart to be certain of god
[49:27] be certain of god be know that he is god
[49:30] he's still the god that was the god of
[49:33] elijah the god of the women of zeropath
[49:35] the god of esther the god of daniel the
[49:38] god of david he's still that same god
[49:41] he said when we met his requirements
[49:44] what are his requirements
[49:46] we begin to think in our heart that
[49:47] we've got to do all these things that
[49:49] we've got to go through all these
[49:50] whatever to do like the catholics and
[49:53] and and confess something before a
[49:54] priest or push a penny with our nose or
[49:57] walk so many miles as penance or
[49:59] but he said listen when we met his
[50:01] requirements and what are his
[50:03] requirements repent every one of you and
[50:05] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[50:07] for the remission of your sins and you
[50:09] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[50:12] that's his promise
[50:14] when you've met his requirements and
[50:15] you've repented and you've been baptized
[50:17] and you have met his requirements and
[50:19] you can come even if even if he doesn't
[50:21] answer immediately you can be certain of
[50:24] god that he'll come on the scene and
[50:26] fulfill his promise because he promised
[50:28] that he would give you the baptism of
[50:30] the holy ghost
[50:31] well what if you're sick what are his
[50:32] requirements
[50:34] he said any among you sick call the
[50:35] elders of the church and let them anoint
[50:37] and all in prayer the prayer of faith
[50:39] shall save the sick and god shall raise
[50:42] him up and you come and you do you meet
[50:44] god's requirement you believe you
[50:46] believe it and you you come and let the
[50:47] elders pray for you and then you just
[50:50] maybe it doesn't look like god's going
[50:52] to do anything but that's when you need
[50:53] to be certain of god
[50:56] rest with faith that's when faith will
[50:58] answer back and say i don't care if i
[51:00] don't see it i don't care if it takes
[51:02] like like abraham many years decades i
[51:05] don't care but i'm standing firm on
[51:08] god's promises because i know that he's
[51:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:12] he said that settles it confess your
[51:15] faults one to another and pray one for
[51:17] another
[51:20] you've met god's requirements
[51:23] these signs shall follow them that
[51:24] believe
[51:25] in my name they shall cast out devils
[51:28] they'll speak with new tongues if they
[51:30] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[51:32] that shall not harm them if they lay
[51:34] their hands on the sick they shall
[51:36] recover
[51:37] that settles it
[51:38] while we got those promises we've got an
[51:41] assurance now all we have to do is just
[51:43] put our faith to work and be certain of
[51:46] god certain that he will keep his
[51:48] promises he's the one that said it
[51:50] we don't have to prove it he's the one
[51:52] that said it he'll prove it but we just
[51:54] have to believe it he said be certain
[51:57] first before you do anything be certain
[52:00] in your heart that it's god and when
[52:01] you've met everything that he said then
[52:04] you're sure that he's god
[52:06] that's when faith goes to work right
[52:08] there
[52:09] faith stands steady for it knows that he
[52:11] is and you've met every requirement you
[52:14] believe that he is and faith holds
[52:16] steady oh blessed be his name faith
[52:18] won't move for sure that god is in a
[52:22] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[52:24] him do you see what faith is faith does
[52:27] not rely on seeing something
[52:28] supernatural or feeling something
[52:30] supernatural or maybe it's maybe it
[52:32] doesn't even matter
[52:34] it doesn't rely on you being a church or
[52:36] a minister or laying hands on you or
[52:38] somebody touching you faith faith just
[52:41] won't move regardless it knows that
[52:43] god's word is true it's just trusting on
[52:46] what god has already said
[52:48] he said if you met god's requirement and
[52:50] in your heart you believe that he is
[52:53] god's only testing your faith for he
[52:55] loves to do that what is god's
[52:57] requirement what is god's only
[52:59] requirement for you to believe his word
[53:02] for you to say i believe that for you to
[53:04] hang on and believe no matter what the
[53:06] circumstances look like no matter what
[53:08] the gloom looks like no matter whether
[53:10] the hospital equipment is beeping no
[53:13] matter what the devil says you just hang
[53:15] on because you have met god's
[53:17] requirement you believe his word
[53:20] then remember if his if he is
[53:23] his word has to be true and if he
[53:25] required you to meet these circumstances
[53:27] and you did he's obligated to take care
[53:30] of his word
[53:32] don't back off and say oh i never got
[53:34] healed
[53:35] oh you poor weak faith
[53:38] when you've met his requirements
[53:40] that brings your faith to a showdown
[53:43] to a showdown and the showdown is are
[53:46] you going to accept god's word are you
[53:49] going to stand upon the promises of
[53:51] god's word despite what everything
[53:53] around you looks like
[53:54] be certain of god
[53:56] [Music]
[53:58] listen there is no
[54:00] no despair in christ
[54:02] when you get
[54:03] when the high priest would go into the
[54:05] holy of holies and surrounded by the
[54:07] shine of glory there would be no that's
[54:09] no place of despair no place of crying
[54:11] out and wondering if god is going to
[54:13] keep his word they're surrounded by the
[54:15] holy of holies
[54:18] it's time to be certain of god and not
[54:20] be moved
[54:21] moved by gloom and fear into a place of
[54:23] despair while we're running toward to
[54:26] and fro saying oh no oh no
[54:29] he said when you confess all your all
[54:31] your sins and promise god what you'll do
[54:34] if you'll let you get well and then
[54:35] because it don't happen you run off like
[54:38] a coward somewhere god can't use that
[54:41] there's no way for him to use you
[54:43] there's no way for him to answer you
[54:45] because he only answers by faith
[54:48] and then all of a sudden you go away and
[54:49] he can't answer but real truth faith
[54:52] stands there being sure that god is
[54:55] sure that god is be certain that he is
[54:58] and i believe this afternoon that with
[55:00] the word that we've heard with the word
[55:02] that's laying in our heart that we've
[55:03] packed in over the years now we can
[55:06] surely say that we are certain that he
[55:08] is we know that he is that he's a reveal
[55:11] of the secrets of the heart he's
[55:13] we know that he's a present help in time
[55:15] of need we know that his word is true he
[55:18] said if god asked this thing to be done
[55:20] to confess your sins and so forth and
[55:23] you've done it faith says that he is
[55:26] it's certain that it's going to happen
[55:28] your request has to be granted oh i hope
[55:31] you don't miss that if you're sure of
[55:33] god
[55:34] god's sure of his word
[55:37] i want to ask you this while you're
[55:38] listening in from home are you sure of
[55:40] god because if you're sure of god god is
[55:43] sure of his word he's only waiting to
[55:47] test you to see where you believe
[55:50] do you believe despite of all the gloom
[55:53] do you believe his word do you believe
[55:55] all that you've heard do you believe
[55:56] that promises are true do you believe
[55:58] he's still here he's a prison help in
[56:01] time of trouble do you believe
[56:07] the bible is for a full of stories of
[56:10] people heroes of the faith that went
[56:13] through gloomy situations
[56:15] the hebrew children that when they were
[56:16] tested in gloom and despair and they
[56:19] wasn't to bow to an idol because god had
[56:22] confidence in them
[56:24] they know that he was jehovah they know
[56:26] that he answered prayer but whether he
[56:28] did in their case or not it would have
[56:30] to be for the good so they just made
[56:32] their statement confess their sins and
[56:34] walked into death when they were going
[56:36] to the fiery furnace knowing that they
[56:38] were certain that if god let them burn
[56:40] up he'd raise them up again in the
[56:41] resurrection they were certain of god
[56:44] because they know that god would work
[56:46] everything for their good are you
[56:48] certain this afternoon that god will
[56:50] work everything for your good
[56:53] or were you willing to walk through the
[56:54] fire in the gloom of despair like they
[56:56] were knowing knowing they all things
[56:59] work together for the good to them that
[57:01] love god to them who are the called
[57:03] according to his purpose
[57:05] everything is seen like sometimes things
[57:07] are out of cater people get sick and
[57:09] they can't minister people get sick or
[57:11] whatever things get begin to get moved
[57:13] and shuffled around but yet all things
[57:15] work together for good we've got that
[57:18] promise that no matter what life throws
[57:20] at us no matter what darts the devil can
[57:22] throw at us
[57:23] all things everything is for your good
[57:26] to them who are the call according to
[57:28] his purpose
[57:29] so they made one statement a hebrew
[57:31] children they were certain
[57:33] they were certain and they walked right
[57:35] into the fiery furnace and god let them
[57:37] walk there sitting looking at them
[57:40] setting looking at them and now he's
[57:41] looking at you he's looking at us this
[57:43] afternoon he wanted to see their
[57:45] reaction and he wants to see your
[57:47] reaction what will you do
[57:49] god said i'll see what they'll do about
[57:52] it i'll see what reaction their faith
[57:54] has how will they react and they reacted
[57:56] by saying we're not we will not bow
[57:59] we'll go we'll go into the fire we'll do
[58:01] whatever it takes because we are certain
[58:04] of god he said they walked right up to
[58:06] that fiery first furnace and right at
[58:09] the last moment there he'd come riding
[58:11] out of the heavens on a chariot of wind
[58:13] fan the breezes off of them while he
[58:15] consoled them and talked to them god let
[58:18] your faith come to the spot
[58:20] where it'll react
[58:22] he brings you to a place of despair and
[58:25] gloom where
[58:26] something's got to happen your faith has
[58:28] to take over
[58:30] faith begins to move god lets your faith
[58:32] come to the spirit where a place where
[58:34] to react he let them go into the fire so
[58:38] faith would do something
[58:42] so look at the story of job where he
[58:44] began to be accused by satan satan our
[58:47] accuser accused him of being a secret
[58:48] sinner but job know that he had not seen
[58:52] he know that he'd confessed everything
[58:54] that he'd done and put a bird offering
[58:56] out there that was god's requirement and
[58:58] he met every everything that god
[59:00] required he offered
[59:02] the bird offering he'd he sacrificed for
[59:04] even the secret sins of his family
[59:06] just perchance maybe somebody's done
[59:08] something that they haven't confessed
[59:10] maybe somebody's done something that i
[59:12] don't know about i'm gonna offer a
[59:14] sacrifice that he had done he had met
[59:16] everything that god required he said
[59:18] that's all god required was that burnt
[59:20] offering and a confession and job done
[59:23] those things
[59:26] satan said i'll take his camels for he's
[59:28] a rich man i'll take his sheep and
[59:30] finally he taken his children the
[59:32] closest to his heart but still job stood
[59:35] pat for he was certain he was god for he
[59:40] had talked to him and he met his
[59:41] requirements he was certain he was god
[59:44] even though he lost everything god took
[59:47] everything he allowed everything to be
[59:49] taken away from it until he was sitting
[59:51] on that ball he was scraping his bowls
[59:53] and he had lost everything and he
[59:55] brother brown said oh god when a man
[59:57] keeps what god said do he's certain he's
[1:00:00] god he's had to answer
[1:00:03] faith calls him on the scene every time
[1:00:06] if you've been anointed and prayed for
[1:00:08] god's waiting to see what you'll believe
[1:00:10] about it not run up next sunday and run
[1:00:13] the next day until the next healer comes
[1:00:15] through the city he's waiting to see
[1:00:17] your reaction on your faith
[1:00:19] he's looking at you tonight this
[1:00:20] afternoon warning to see what your
[1:00:22] reaction will be
[1:00:24] he said when you've done what you know
[1:00:25] was right when you've met his
[1:00:27] requirement when you confessed and made
[1:00:29] right and done restitutions and laid it
[1:00:31] before god i don't care how silent he is
[1:00:34] he's still god waiting to put that faith
[1:00:37] there you've done your works
[1:00:39] now he wants to see your faith by your
[1:00:41] works he wants to see
[1:00:44] what you'll do
[1:00:48] when you openly confess that god is the
[1:00:50] same god and you're alive your life
[1:00:53] applied in his hands to be lord i am the
[1:00:56] clay thou art the potter then ask what
[1:00:59] you will faith will never move it'll
[1:01:01] stand right there what's what's god
[1:01:03] looking for he's looking for somebody
[1:01:05] that will surrender their whole heart
[1:01:07] they will surrender their whole being
[1:01:09] and say lord i know i know you're the
[1:01:11] one that you're the one that can deliver
[1:01:13] me you're the only
[1:01:14] source of my strength
[1:01:16] job said i made my confession i put the
[1:01:19] burnt offering out before god and i'm
[1:01:21] not a sinner he know where he was
[1:01:23] standing then everything went on just on
[1:01:26] and on and on just as hard as it could
[1:01:28] go
[1:01:29] trying to down job and to bring job to a
[1:01:32] place
[1:01:34] that he would deny god and deny that
[1:01:36] burnt offering
[1:01:43] he said and job said
[1:01:47] you see so many times we look at
[1:01:49] circumstances and he even said well look
[1:01:51] at we'll look at preachers and he said
[1:01:53] don't look at the preachers in their
[1:01:54] faults and their complexes how satan
[1:01:57] likes to throw that at you why you're no
[1:01:59] better than you was when you was
[1:02:00] anointed
[1:02:02] you're no better than you was when them
[1:02:03] preachers prayed for you then preachers
[1:02:06] ain't right in the first place but he
[1:02:07] said it doesn't matter about that
[1:02:09] preacher it's your faith in the living
[1:02:11] god what mouse it's not what the
[1:02:13] preacher is it's what god is the
[1:02:15] preacher never made the promise
[1:02:17] god made the promise it's not up to the
[1:02:20] preacher it's up to god and your faith
[1:02:22] to believe that that is god
[1:02:24] so be certain of god be certain that
[1:02:26] it's god and that's god's word and god
[1:02:29] is in his word a job was certain of god
[1:02:32] and even to the place where his wife
[1:02:34] began to say thou speak she said thus
[1:02:36] thou still retain that integrity curse
[1:02:38] god and die but he said unto earth thou
[1:02:41] speak us as one of the foolish women
[1:02:42] speaketh
[1:02:44] job said thou speak us like a foolish
[1:02:46] woman
[1:02:47] he said the lord gave and the lord
[1:02:49] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:02:52] lord he was certain that there was god
[1:02:54] and listen what brother said he said and
[1:02:56] when he got that out of his mouth
[1:02:59] the thunders began to roar and the
[1:03:01] lightning began to flash
[1:03:03] god moved on the scene
[1:03:05] it always calls him on the scene when
[1:03:07] you are certain of his word when you are
[1:03:10] certain that he's god he said he'll sit
[1:03:12] silent for a long time that's what he's
[1:03:14] doing he said inside look at this bunch
[1:03:17] of hail bound americans church going
[1:03:20] hypocrites he said i'm not angry but sin
[1:03:22] angers anybody that's right with god i'm
[1:03:25] not angry with the nation not angry with
[1:03:27] the people but i'm angry with the devil
[1:03:29] who has caused these things to blind the
[1:03:31] people he's angry with with the
[1:03:33] situation that the devil's got the
[1:03:35] people in where they're trying to cover
[1:03:36] themselves over with the religion he
[1:03:39] said these blind pastors and preachers
[1:03:41] let them get by with some kind of a
[1:03:42] little man-made theology you've got to
[1:03:45] be born again and god keeps his word
[1:03:48] this poor little woman she knew that he
[1:03:50] was god
[1:03:52] as that barrel went down down down
[1:03:55] circumstances got worse and worse all
[1:03:57] the time
[1:03:58] but god was letting it get that way he
[1:04:01] just loves to do that he loves to put
[1:04:03] your faith to a test to see how you act
[1:04:06] on it let you be anointed and prayed for
[1:04:08] then make you worse say come on satan
[1:04:10] put him to the test i know he believes
[1:04:12] me bless god forever put him to a test
[1:04:15] now i know he took my word for it could
[1:04:17] he say that about you
[1:04:20] daylight broke she said the little fella
[1:04:22] had cried all night for something to eat
[1:04:25] and she said what will i do with one
[1:04:27] little handful of meal
[1:04:29] could you could you think about that
[1:04:30] question now what will i do she all she
[1:04:33] had was one little handful of meal left
[1:04:36] this little
[1:04:37] widow woman of zeropath
[1:04:39] all she had was one little
[1:04:41] little handful of meal that she thought
[1:04:43] was no longer maybe didn't have the
[1:04:45] value that it used to have and he said
[1:04:48] you know that meal was christ
[1:04:50] so if you just have a little just a
[1:04:53] little meager measure of christ if you
[1:04:55] just started out with a drop a little
[1:04:57] drop of christ he said any bible student
[1:05:00] knows that christ was that meal offering
[1:05:01] and that meal offering had to be ground
[1:05:03] with a special burr too because jesus
[1:05:06] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:09] forever and the oil and then she mixed
[1:05:11] that with the oil and the oil means the
[1:05:13] spirit as we know according to ezekiel 4
[1:05:16] and so forth that's the reason we anoint
[1:05:18] with oil it's the spirit what is it and
[1:05:21] she the father seeking such to worship
[1:05:24] him in spirit and in truth the spirit
[1:05:26] the oil and the truth that meal offering
[1:05:29] jesus was the truth he was the meal
[1:05:31] offering and this oil was the spirit and
[1:05:34] the spirit mixed with the truth has got
[1:05:37] to bring something and he said put it
[1:05:39] together now you put it together the
[1:05:41] meal the word that you've heard put it
[1:05:43] together with the spirit quickening that
[1:05:45] word put it together and it makes a cake
[1:05:48] and it makes a kid it'll make a cake
[1:05:50] something that you can live off of and
[1:05:52] then but see you put those together and
[1:05:54] there's one final ingredient to the
[1:05:56] recipe that so many people forget and
[1:05:59] that's the two sticks and he said now
[1:06:01] what's it ready for it's ready for the
[1:06:03] cross it's ready for self-sacrifice
[1:06:05] that's what you have to do if the word's
[1:06:07] been preached and you've got the spirit
[1:06:09] in it mixed together it's self-sacrifice
[1:06:12] to deny every pain to deny every
[1:06:15] sickness to deny every everything that's
[1:06:18] contrary to god's word and stand on it
[1:06:21] the doctor says this that or the other
[1:06:23] that don't make a bit of difference
[1:06:26] you stand on it because god says so
[1:06:29] the meal comes you got the oil you mix
[1:06:32] it together mix it together and put it
[1:06:34] put it on the fire with those two sticks
[1:06:36] he said in the old times they never
[1:06:38] found a better way to make a fire
[1:06:41] there's not a better way to make the
[1:06:42] holy ghost in fire there's not a better
[1:06:44] way to get the holy ghost than take the
[1:06:46] meal and the oil and put it together on
[1:06:48] this two sticks of your self-sacrifice
[1:06:50] willing to die out to your own reasoning
[1:06:53] to the only to your own way of looking
[1:06:55] at things he said if the preacher
[1:06:57] preaches the word and the man that
[1:06:59] receives it believes it and acts upon it
[1:07:02] something's got to happen
[1:07:05] if you're a sinner you'll have to be
[1:07:06] saved
[1:07:07] if you're sick you'll have to be healed
[1:07:09] because god promised it as as if
[1:07:12] promised that if we are certain of god
[1:07:14] as certain as he's god he has to keep
[1:07:17] his word
[1:07:18] certainly
[1:07:19] then the command was go to the city for
[1:07:21] i have commanded a widow woman a vision
[1:07:24] before broke before the prophet he's
[1:07:26] just obeying because when the prop when
[1:07:28] the requirement is met something will
[1:07:30] happen
[1:07:31] she looked and she saw a man standing
[1:07:34] leaning across the gate thin cheeked
[1:07:36] bearded bald-headed looking across the
[1:07:38] gate with an old piece of sheepskin
[1:07:40] wrapped around him looked like he was
[1:07:42] kind of an old
[1:07:43] looking old gentleman she said i'll
[1:07:45] share my water with him and he said
[1:07:47] he can brother ram compare that with the
[1:07:49] waters of life you're you're ready to
[1:07:51] share the gospel with anybody but you
[1:07:53] know
[1:07:54] one thing i'd like to get out of this
[1:07:56] story is that everything that happened
[1:07:58] to this little widow woman as she's she
[1:08:00] she's in the the depths of despair of
[1:08:02] gloom and she don't have nothing there
[1:08:04] and here this man comes out of the
[1:08:06] wilderness dressed dressed in sheepskin
[1:08:08] he begins to say give give me the last
[1:08:12] little bit that you've got give me your
[1:08:13] water give me your meal it begins to
[1:08:16] like make all these demands of her but
[1:08:18] yet she wasn't offended you begin to
[1:08:21] look through the scripture and find all
[1:08:22] the places where it looked like people
[1:08:24] had a right to be offended but yes she
[1:08:26] wasn't she wasn't offended naaman wasn't
[1:08:29] offended when when the prophet would not
[1:08:31] even come out to see him he just sent
[1:08:32] his little messenger to go tell him and
[1:08:34] then he told him to go dip in the water
[1:08:36] and the old muddy river jordan seven
[1:08:39] times go dip in that muddy water but
[1:08:41] yeah he wasn't offended and so many
[1:08:43] times we get offended at the word we get
[1:08:45] offended at the way that it's presented
[1:08:47] we'll get offended at the way that the
[1:08:49] minister delivers it or whatever you
[1:08:51] know there's many things that you could
[1:08:52] be offended at me maybe this afternoon
[1:08:55] you could get offended at my southern
[1:08:57] accent or the way i kind of have a heat
[1:08:59] way of expressing her maybe i skip over
[1:09:02] things or whatever there's many things
[1:09:03] to be offended in the same way that
[1:09:05] maybe that little widow woman had many
[1:09:07] things to be offended at elijah there's
[1:09:09] many ways that many things that you
[1:09:10] could be maybe offended at the pastor or
[1:09:13] at brother branham with his kentucky
[1:09:15] accent the way they his delivery but yet
[1:09:18] if you just receive it in the way that
[1:09:20] it's delivered something will happen
[1:09:26] she said just a moment sir
[1:09:28] she backs with the sticks in her hand
[1:09:29] and the voice thundered again not only
[1:09:31] do you share your water but bring me a
[1:09:33] little morsel of bread in your hand
[1:09:36] bread of life water of life was it of
[1:09:38] life she'd die as soon as that perished
[1:09:40] bring me your water and bring you bring
[1:09:42] me your bread
[1:09:44] what do we find here
[1:09:45] what lesson can we find seek ye first
[1:09:48] the kingdom of god and all his
[1:09:49] righteousness put put god first in
[1:09:52] everything that you do lay down all the
[1:09:54] little things that maybe you could be
[1:09:56] offended at lay down all your ideas when
[1:09:59] the doctor says you can't get well put
[1:10:01] his word first when when somebody says
[1:10:03] you're you're too much of a sinner or
[1:10:05] maybe you're a prostitute even brother
[1:10:07] brown said or a gambler a drunkard
[1:10:09] god's word first because god's word
[1:10:12] god's word is able to deliver though
[1:10:14] your skins be a scarlet they shall be as
[1:10:16] white as snow red like crimson they'll
[1:10:18] be white like wool put god first go

[1:10:26] me

[1:10:29] give it into his hands brother branham
[1:10:31] said
[1:10:32] my life all that i am all that i know he
[1:10:35] begins to ask himself that question all
[1:10:37] that i am i'm 50 years old are you
[1:10:39] willing william branham to lay it to me
[1:10:42] are you willing maybe tonight to this
[1:10:44] afternoon i could ask that same question
[1:10:45] are you really willing bob black to lay
[1:10:48] it to me are you willing your little
[1:10:50] children to lay your life to me are you
[1:10:52] willing to ask yourself that question to

[1:10:57] do it sick people can you trust me
[1:10:59] put me first bring a morsel of bread in
[1:11:01] your hand and fetch me a little water
[1:11:04] she looked at him there was something
[1:11:06] told her that that man knowed what he
[1:11:08] was talking about
[1:11:10] god knows his own
[1:11:12] there had come across the fence because
[1:11:14] she was obeying and the gloom broke thus
[1:11:17] saith the lord the barrel will not go
[1:11:19] empty or the crews run die run dry and
[1:11:22] she she his brother said she made the
[1:11:24] cake
[1:11:25] she gave it to the prophet
[1:11:27] she went back and made some for her son
[1:11:29] and herself
[1:11:31] and they eat and drank with plenty upon
[1:11:33] the earth
[1:11:34] and he asked the question where did it
[1:11:36] come from
[1:11:37] where did all that plenty come from how
[1:11:39] did it get there
[1:11:41] scientifically tell me where that meal
[1:11:43] come from where did that oil come from
[1:11:45] how did it get in that cruise you might
[1:11:48] have lost your health you might have
[1:11:49] lost your fellowship but just take him
[1:11:51] at his word be certain that he's god
[1:11:54] the gloomy times that's looking now
[1:11:56] might not look might not look so gloomy
[1:11:58] if you'll just take his work
[1:12:01] if you'll just take his word and be
[1:12:03] certain that he's god
[1:12:05] you know brother brown told that story
[1:12:07] about that he was over in germany and he
[1:12:09] saw that painting on the wall that was
[1:12:11] called the cloud land and it looked like
[1:12:13] when you when you stand way back away
[1:12:14] from it it looked real gloomy and dark
[1:12:17] but the closer you got up to it then you
[1:12:19] begin to see the angels wings beating he
[1:12:22] said when you see it off in a distance
[1:12:23] this is the horriblest looking gloom
[1:12:25] you've ever seen see that's how life
[1:12:27] looks sometimes that's how the little
[1:12:29] story of the widow woman it looked real
[1:12:31] gloomy and
[1:12:33] and
[1:12:34] even today things can look real gloomy
[1:12:36] just clouds matted together when you're
[1:12:38] looking at it from a long distance but
[1:12:40] when you get real close to it it changes
[1:12:43] it changes when you get when you close
[1:12:45] in on it because you realize that god's
[1:12:47] actually he's molding your character
[1:12:49] he's doing something for your good all
[1:12:52] these things are for your good to mold
[1:12:54] you into the image of what he wants you
[1:12:56] to be to match you up with his word he's
[1:12:58] molding you and he's he's he's testing
[1:13:00] your faith he wants to see faith
[1:13:03] reaction he said when you get real close
[1:13:05] to it it changes its angels wings
[1:13:08] beating together singing hallelujahs to
[1:13:10] the lord so that's what gloom is
[1:13:12] sometimes if you look at it at a long
