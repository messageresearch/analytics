[Music] [Music] [Music] amen let's give the lord praise this morning hallelujah amen amen glory to god isn't god so good to us amen are just sitting there in the office and just when are singing the praises of the lord the presence of god just drops down you know the bible teaches us that he inhabits the praises of his people if you want the glory of god to drop if you want the presence of god to to drop in your in our churches and in our homes and in our marriages praise the lord praise ye the lord in the good times in the bad times when you feel like praising him praise the lord when you don't feel like praising him and sometimes your body don't feel like praising him but you praise him anyhow because that brings the glory of the lord you see the the order we see the orders of the scripture and there's always praise before battle there's always praise and thanksgiving to the lord amen it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord this morning we'd like to greet you all thank you brother wade for having us inviting us up and brother samuel and all the ministry team here y'all have a wonderful team that that keeps things going and keeps this portion of god's bride on the straight and narrow amen we're living in such dark and tricky times and it's such a blessing to have a good church a good solid church to back you up and we appreciate y'all so much and we bring you greetings from our church in uh in virginia brother ron with andrew they send their love and their greetings and from the church and he certainly appreciates all those prayers and as you all know he's in a battle but god promised to be with us in the battle you know he didn't promise it'd only be good times it'd only be a flowery bed of ease he promised he'd never leave us or forsake us but i tell you what brothers and sisters he's certainly taken and many others has taken every excuse to not come to church when he stands there in his condition and he preaches and even when he don't preach he still he's still there pulling on the word standing up with maybe splitting headaches you never know but he's at his post of duty and your post of duty may not be behind a pulpit your post of duty is in the house of god amen so we certainly appreciate and love each and every one of you we like to thank my sister monica for hosting rebecca myself and her husband oh brother bob thank you brother bob he did a wonderful job this morning on sunday school didn't he amen appreciate i love them so much with all my heart and appreciate them and my wife and and my boys ended up having to stay home this time we're expecting another baby to do to arrive here in probably about seven eight weeks right in there so traveling is a bit difficult so we hope to bring my better half next time along and uh by the way said amen there was no there was no hesitation there he said amen right there so we certainly love y'all with all of our hearts we won't keep y'all standing but if you will if you turn with me to matthew the 13th chapter we'll begin with the 45th verse again it's certainly an honor and privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning with believers of light precious faith you believe the same message you're expecting the same lord jesus amen it's wonderful the bible says jesus speaking again the kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it if you have to also turn with me to luke chapter 14 verse 27 jesus also speaking and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and count off the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest happily after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that beholdeth it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consult with whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is a great way off he sendeth an message and desireth conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath cannot be my disciple amen let's bow our heads in prayer the gracious kind heavenly father lord jesus we thank you so much lord for this honor and a privilege to stand among lord jesus the redeemed the very lord attribute to the living god father lord to be standing here we just counted such a privilege lord we thank you for your presence that's already here we thank you for your presence that always vindicates the word father god lord we just ask lord that you just now be with us come with us forgive us of our sins lord i just pray personally that you set me in a corner father lord and just use my own vessel or that i give to you even now speak the word to your people lord i within my humanity have nothing to say but father lord may your spirit say something that would help encourage strengthen and touch and deliver your people we love you lord and we promise to give you all the praise honor and glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you in the presence of the lord this morning with help of the lord i'd like to give this sermon a title of counting the cost you know in our natural lives it's it's uh we have with the world that we live in with inflation constantly going up and you know every time we turn around seem like groceries and gas and all all the natural things of living we have to be careful of our spending many times and watch our budgeting and our financing and if something costs too much we may have to wait till it goes on sale or we look you know for that certain coupon that may help us to get just a little edge on things and we have to do that just as long as we we live in this life but you know there's also a spiritual application to cost and we and when you and as we look in the scriptures this morning it's it's a lot different in the spiritual than it is in the natural because in the natural as i said we try and save we we withhold things back and then maybe maybe we delay some instant gratification as it's called in order to save up for this that or the other or college or whatever stage you are in life but in the spiritual sense there's a spiritual application that we are always to go all in there is no there there's no retreat there's there's no going back there's no waiting until we get this thing done or maybe situated in our life or maybe one after i get married that will be the answer then i'll surrender my heart to the lord jesus or maybe after i get this job or maybe when i graduate i'm going to withhold something i'm going to save maybe my soul or i'm going to save save making a full surrender until after this or this may happen and the spiritual because the natural will be done away the money system will be done away with thank god we won't have money in heaven there won't be no spending there'll be no saving there'll be no bounce checks praise the lord you know and spiritually speaking when we go all in we now have the entire bank of heaven as it were that is behind us and the prophet teaches us that when we become born again god gives you a checkbook and in this checkbook all of heaven stands behind this word so whenever you write a check and you write your request brother bob it is a promise and a guarantee that that check will be cash people in today's society act like they have that in the natural but we find out it ends up catching up to them the government thinks they have that and they just print more money and they just go but you know this kingdom as i said is going to an end but in the spiritual we have a checkbook with unlimited resources we have a checkbook with unlimited finances whatever you desire as long as it's in the word and if your heart because see the checkbook doesn't come till after you're born again because before you're born again you can ask amiss and jesus said you have not because you asked not and you ask a miss you just ask for this or that and it doesn't is there's no spiritual application there's no real spiritual backdrop to why you want what you want you see when a person becomes born again and let's just say they're single they become born again they then begin to have the right reasons to want to get married they begin to look for the right things in a mate but before that they may look at the wrong things and we know there's an end to that so there's a spiritual application of going all in and many times you must count the cost of something and many times things can cost you dearly both naturally but but this morning this i'm not teaching finances this is teaching you spiritual things things can cost you very dearly spiritually both a good decision and a wrong decision but you've got to count the cost before you make a decision you've got to count the cost is this decision is this group of friends going to draw me closer to the lord or are they going to take me away from the lord am i going to be able to go to church with my friends or am i going to go do something else while church is going on with my friends and to that decision there is a cost to pay and you can either reap the benefits or or reap the wrong thing but you've got to count the cost to your actions we see in the scripture that when abraham brother bob was was teaching there on abraham when eight when when after the promise was fulfilled and they had more children and things that abraham did and when the process of time came and sarah died there came a time where eight where sarah needed abraham needed a burial place for for sarah now we know in the old testament that the burial place was very important abraham knew because of because he sought a king who's or he sought a city whose king and maker and builder was god he knew that it was very important on where to bury sarah in the promised land so you can read the scriptures and we're going to just skip over it uh this morning for the sake of time but there in genesis 23 he begins to look for a burial ground and he approaches his these people for the burial ground and he tells them why he needs it and they want it they want to give it to abraham they want to give this parcel of land saying look you bury your dead there you take them there lay them at rest it'll be yours don't worry about it but you can see in the scripture that abraham actually refused it for free now in our natural selves the idea of something especially like land if somebody knocked on your door and offered you a parcel of land for free any person would jump at it sure but there's a spiritual application that abraham wanted to make sure that throughout all generations that no one could come back and reclaim that land he wanted to pay for it he said no i'm not going to take it for free i'm going to pay and not only am i going to pay i'm going to pay top dollar for it i'm going to pay what it's worth and more than it's worth just so that it did not money was not was not did not matter to him now understand spiritual application here there's a spiritual application that abraham refuses the land for free he it's got to cost him something if something does not cost you something then you'll take you for granted you won't appreciate it and that's what's wrong with with with the generation that we live in is that things are given to them the more something is given to a person to humanity in general the less they appreciate it when someone is as as the saying goes born with a silver spoon in their mouth they don't appreciate the hard work it took to get there but i can appreciate naturally speaking we can appreciate a man or a woman that's successful that actually works for it so there's a spiritual application to counting the cost whenever boaz whenever ruth came back into the homeland with naomi it boaz had to count the cost what would it cost him to redeem to redeem ruth because we know her that there were the nearer kinsmen than boaz but when he counted the cost he said no i'm going to borrow my own inheritance but boaz knew what he was doing he went into the redemption with his eyes wide open he put his entire wealth his influence his name he put it all on the line for ruth if he redeemed ruth everything boaz was was now going to be attributed to ruth now everything that everything ruth was a moabiter she was this that culture does this they're an enemy to israel all this but boaz counted the cost and ruth was worth it to him amen amen you see the spiritual application there because we and ourselves were no good but everything god was his entire reputation he attached his name to yours so when he attached his name to yours you now have his authority jesus didn't get cheap with redemption now remember understand as we go along i don't mean i don't know that the situation and everyone's got their own personality if they're spinners or if they're not this is not what this is about this isn't to justify you know you go out the door and say babe the preacher said you gotta we gotta give it all i want that mercedes he said give it all no no no so understand this is spiritual jesus counter the cost in the old testament we find that david actually sinned there came a time where david began to desire a census of the people so he began to number the people and he wanted to find out how many soldiers he had and god and that really displeased the lord and job tried to talk him out of it but but he but he went anyway and he he numbered him and then he realized that he had actually done wrong and and the prophet i believe it was god came to him and said god has given you three options a punishment for this sin he said you can either have three years of famine three years or three months of defeat before your enemies or three days of pestilence you decide well david did the right thing he just he he was repentant and he threw himself at the mercy of the lord he said i'm not going to choose i'm going to be at the mercy of the lord because i've already made the wrong decision once i can do it again so as god ended up choosing that there would be the three days of pestilence and there fell of israel seventy thousand men in first chronicles 21 14 so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to res to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord be held and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyeth it is enough stay now thy hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between earth and heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem imagine seeing that imagine seeing the judgment angel and 70 000 men and you are responsible for 70 000 deaths because you made a mistake see david didn't count the cost of his actions before doing that then david and the elders of israel who were clothed with cloth with sackcloth and sackcloth fell upon their faces and then further down and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i is it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let that hand i pray thee o lord be on me and on my father's house and not on thy people that they should be plagued and the angel of the lord commanded god to say to david that david should go up and set an altar unto the lord in the threshing floor of onan the jebusite so david did as the angel of the lord instructed and when when when ornan seen david coming down he and david and david wanted that in verse 22 then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshing floor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it to me for full price that the plague may be stayed from the people now listen to ornan and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give it thee i'll give you the oxen for the burnt offerings the threshing floor instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i'll give it to you i'll give it all to you you're the king you're god's anointed you're god's blessed i'll give it to you so so because that god that's what god called you to do and listen to what look at what david says and king david said to ornanee but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is dying for the lord nor burn offerings without a cost david knew it had to cost him something it had to he can't just get a mistake and it not cost something it had to cost david something he had to feel the pain of his repentance repentance without regret for our sins is not true repentance it's also what's called the dried-out confession you really you know people people feel sorry or feel bad that they got caught but they don't feel sad or really repentant in their heart for what they actually did that's the difference it's got to then cost you something it may cost you some friends or true repentance toward god is going to cause you to change how you live it may you know drawing closer to the lord is how do we draw closer to the lord by read our bible and pray it's going to cost us a little more time on our knees it's going to cost us a little more time reading the bible even dare i say when you don't feel like it preachers don't always feel like studying that may be a news flash is that right my brothers preachers don't always feel like praying preachers don't always feel like preaching [Music] but it's not us it's not up it's not up to how we feel but there's a cost to it but the reward will always way outweigh the cost so david wanted to pay he would refuse it for free just like abraham do you see that strain they refuse things for free because there's a spiritual application to paying all giving it all you don't hold back when we serve god we serve god with all of our hearts with everything that we have if we don't serve god with all of our hearts then we're not fully surrendered so we come to the greatest example jesus christ the son of david he countered that cost of redemption before the foundation of the world he already counted it he already knew what it would cost him and he already took care of it in his mind it was a finished work but in time he had then as his attributes and the different attributes within him of love and father and savior and healer it then took time to draw that to bring that down from him to humanity but he's always had that right in first peter 1 18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things in the old testament when the brother had to sell out because he had hit hard times and he had to actually sell his inheritance to his brother in israel you know and then every every 50 years a jubilee trumpet would sound if there was a near kinsman that could actually redeem him they were the cost of redemption was many times with silver that's why peter brings this up we have jeremiah even redeem his cousin there with silver it's a type of redemption but then when peter comes he said for as much you know you know they were still in their old testament frame of mind that they had to be bought and he said that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition of your from your father's but with the precious blood of christ as with a lamb without blemish and without spot he was priceless that blood was priceless but your soul was priceless your soul was priceless you know you sometimes see or you hear you know sometimes you just see a picture of the picture whenever you hear of art you know and i know that the vatican in different places in the world has them and they literally cost so much money brother bob they're literally priceless you they're they're they're so valuable you cannot even put a price tag on it no matter how much money somebody may have and say i want that you can't you don't have enough money i've got so and so it don't matter that's not enough it's priceless you're the bride of jesus christ is priceless the blood of jesus christ is the only thing that could afford to actually redeem your souls it was the blood is the only thing that could pay the price of redemption now it could be any man's blood you know sometimes you you love your family so much you would gladly give your blood you'd gladly give your life to protect them and even if you were to try and pay and and someone committed a crime and that actually have to pay for it which happened repeatedly in history and does to this day they pay for their sins with their own life that's still not enough because once you've paid for your sins and you were killed well you're dead what how is that gonna what purpose is that but you needed a higher life that could come and die for you yet raise you up yet he himself be raised up it took a higher life a higher blood to do the work so remember when god created things and as he started from the little worked his way all the way up to the top god has his own brother said his own evolution as it were when he created an oak tree it always was an oak tree but the intelligence worked its way up he started with the lowlifes and he worked his way up and he capped it off with man that was like the capstone of his creation so when man fell that's why you get bit by fire ants because the fire get we get stung by bees and we get poison ivy and stickers and all these things is because they all that creation was under man so that nature fell so the only thing that could redeem us is something that was higher than us so the only thing higher than us is god so it took god to become flesh to pay the full price for your redemption imagine if he only came what good would it have done brothers and sisters if he would have only come and paid for your natural healing you get healed you get sick again you get healed and eventually death will take you and that's the end of it it's not enough that would have been a partial payment but he paid full price for you because remember whenever adam and eve sold us out and we ended up in the devil's pawn shop he didn't come try and get a discount he didn't come and try and just steal you out of the devil's pawn shop he paid for you he could walk out with you and you can walk out with him in broad daylight through the doors as it was he paid full price for you that should make it that should make us feel real good that god himself was not looking at you as a discount he wasn't waiting until you were just the right price he wasn't waiting until maybe you know what i i can get this kind of redemption to send an angel i can get this kind of redemption to send some second person of the trinity he came himself the fullness of the godhead bodily paid the full price for you and for me because he counted the cost and because you are worth it you know the world is is in the spirit of confusion and people's rights and everybody says to monica is all trying to find their worth who they are and and and and what they identify as and all kinds of nonsense but your soul is worth ten thousand words your soul is worth something your soul was worth the blood of god he paid full price for you and we're proud to say it we're proud to identify it when you pay when he paid full price for you in matthew 26 jesus in the garden of gethsemane then came with jesus into the place called the gethsemane and saith unto his disciples sit ye here while i pray and go yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death terry here wants with me and you went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt what was jesus doing in the garden he was counting the cost was he willing to go all the way he'd heal the sick he'd cleanse the leopard he'd cast out devils he's preached the truth he's delivered he's blessed people but he is he willing to go all the way because the sick that he healed 2000 years ago what good is that do you and me today if he didn't go all the way if he didn't pay the full price what good would that do us so he comes to his disciples and he finds him asleep and we'll go down to verse 42 and he went again the second time saying oh my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done aren't you so thankful that we have a god that was so that's so submissive to his own word so submissive to his own word that even in the garden of eden when he said that day you eat that day that you'll die how it broke his heart to be submitted to his own word but he had to to make him god he had to so that we could have that checkbook he had to submit himself to his own word so we can trust him so you can trust him by the way so you can trust him for your healing so you can trust him for your salvation he had to be to serve a god that would be submissive to his own law that don't do like the politicians today that change it to serve their end but to actually set it not be able to change it and then step into humanity and become penalty to his own word and to pay the full price brother graham speaking he said let's he's talking about jesus aren't you thankful for a prophet that can see things unfold with the eyes of an eagle and god and go all the way down and actually dramatize something for you that just kind of paints such a beautiful picture he said let's just think i can see gabriel come down his great sword standing by side i can see woodworm i can see the other great angels lighting on the rocks around what was it a conference table being said the disciples might have been asleep but jesus wasn't alone then that holy spirit of god as we see on the picture of gethsemane that light which god is light elohim the self-existing one when he came into his presence do you want to go through with this son what the angels are listening because if jesus would have come to this point and said father actually the sins the trans as the transfer of sins begin to unfold and release onto him even though i wasn't born here and you weren't born yet yet our sins were still transferred to him at that time every sin that happened before him and every sin that ever will happen after was transferred onto him so if he would have come up to the garden of gethsemane and then backed off sister kaley then that would have ruined the whole plan of redemption so all of heaven is no doubt listening are you going to go through with this you're at this junction you're beginning to feel the anguish brother luis of the sins of the world upon you but are you going to go through with it what are you gonna do what's gonna be the result the whole world lays upon your shoulder do you want to pay the price or what do you want to do it came down jesus was at a junction he had to decide what was he going to do was he going to pay the full price for you you can come right on now without death there lays calvary before you they're there they'll spit in your face and they'll take you to calvary all these things you'll die in agony jesus knew what kind of death he would die he knew what laid before him but he also knew what laid before him he looked through he looked through the eyes of love and mercy and through the eyes of the blood and he was able to see you at this end time having the ability not within yourself but having the ability given to you by him through the new birth despite all the evil in just the past few years how much more evil has this world gotten how much more evil has it will this world get it does not matter to the born-again believer because they're still standing they're not gonna just drag it to heaven and crawl in like you're just at the end of a boot camp and just barely made it and just oh hanging on to somebody's heels you're going to march into glory when the prophet seen the bride and the vision they were not just slouched they were not just worn out they were not just all confused they were all in a line and they were going in one direction and they were going to the step of the word and there at the end at the very end of the end which is where we live now there was one that got out of step and what the prophet heard himself holler to scream out stay in i've heard this is just if i can just say if you forgive me i'll inject this here i personally believe that's the fifo ministry preaching what the prophet taught keeping that word in line and as we listen to the tapes we continue to be told to stay in line we're preaching the same brother ram because go past the curtain of time and say i preach what paul preached he could say that confidently and i believe true men of god can sin confidently in this age before god himself and say i preached what william branham preached it's the same message it's the same truth so he paid the full price jesus was aware of what it was going to cost him he says let's see what the conference what's the echo going to be all angels are standing around wondering what takes place now the decisions made what is it not my will but thine be done oh the angels unfolded their blessings and began to minister to him preparing him for that great hour bride you have been prepared for this hour you have been prepared and ordained to walk in this evil age you think of how how mad it must make the enemy that here he's got his his evil age he's the god of this evil age he's got satan's eating and he's setting it up and it's all going so well but yet there's a small group of people that scattered all over the world that no matter what i throw at them no matter what kind of influences no matter what kind of filth that i spew out in the age yet they still believe god yet in the age of greatest unbelief yet in the age where nobody even knows what to believe yet they stand there and they keep believing for the body change every every wednesday night and every sunday and every weekend they keep preaching that their body is going to change now to to do the carnal mind into a heart of unbelief that can sound impossible and naturally speaking it is because you can't explain it but to the spiritual mind it's a whole other level you know you think 500 years ago if you walked into the church this morning and you seen an airplane go overhead it didn't bother you there's an airplane 500 years ago what if an airplane would have flown overhead they would have all jumped in caves they would have been terrified but it's nothing to you you're used to it a cargo down the road there goes one now i didn't see any of you jump up and run out and terrified but you know several hundred years ago they would have seen that they would have been scared to death so what it used to be so hard to imagine is now everyday life to us we all came to church in a vehicle so what now can be so hard to imagine for the unbeliever of the body change and angels and the things of god it could be so hard to imagine one day that's going to become our that's our reality now spiritually that's our reality now but then it will become a literal reality where our bodies will literally be changed and i'll say this god doesn't get cheap god maybe we'll get to it but you think of the new jerusalem you read about the new jerusalem and the city you're going to god doesn't get cheap oh buddy it's going to be beautiful and god don't get cheap with your mansion you're gonna be perfect look at your neighbor and say i'm gonna look good you're gonna look good 18 years old you're going to look good amen why because god doesn't get cheap you're going to look perfect we don't have to worry about you know keto and thm and carbs and it's going to be perfect thank you lord yes it's going to be awesome because god doesn't get cheap now remember he owns the cattle on a thousand hills he owns it all but you can see the love of god in his mind he made sure that you have the best and while we're speaking of the best i'll say this the message produces the best the message produces your best marriages the message the message produces our best young people the message produces our best elderly people the message produces the best ministers the best song leaders the best everything the message produces the best amen so if jesus was only born of a virgin he did all the miracles and then he was just translated to heaven that would not have been good enough even with all the miracles even with born of a virgin that would not have been good enough because he would have bypassed the cross he would not have paid the full price it was not enough for him to just be born of a of a virgin and being in a body of flesh like we are into growing an of a headache and lose a best friend and all them things that he he partook of so he'll understand he had to go all the way to the cross and a step further than that but we'll probably get to that a little later but he had to go all the way to the cross to pay the full price now we know that satan when he tented jesus in the mountain there he offered jesus the kingdoms of the world without paying the full price he offered jesus the easy way now remember that was a temptation for jesus satan only had three shots at jesus you better believe that he made every single one of them count he had three strikes he had three shots to get at jesus and one of them was to try and get him to get the kingdoms of the world without paying for them because remember he didn't just have to come to redeem you he had to also come and redeem the earth so the blood the blood saved us by the blood also dripped down and sanctify the earth because we're gonna come back here and live remember god is awesome he is an awesome architect and i believe that he's got you know volcanoes underneath just right and at the right time they'll drop the right bomb in the wrong place or maybe the right place and it's going the whole thing's going to blow and then god's going to recrea we recreate it and make it perfect make it perfect he's going to do it right my goodness it's going to be perfect yes you know whenever when jesus went to the cross and satan was speaking through them priests if thou be the son of god come down from the cross you think of the temptation of jesus he was tempted constantly he was so see it's not wrong to be tempted it's wrong to actually heat temptation to fall into it so jesus was tempted all the way he was literally hanging on the cross and still being tempted to come down but even though they nailed him to a cross even though he was his face was bleeding he was he was just pulverized naturally speaking he had the sins on the world yet he was not dead yet so yet if he would have even come off at that point that wouldn't have been enough he had to say it is finished that's what he had to say because then when he's finished then the price the full price brother aaron of redemption was paid you could go free you can go free you are bought and paid for to be beaten and mocked was not enough for my sins to be nailed to a cross was not enough for my sins he had to die the life had to go out of his body to pay the price as that famous poem says living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glory his day because remember the prophet teaches us that if he that's what i meant by a stepfather if he would have came down for our sins saved us and he would not have actually rose from the dead then he could be questioned who he was but whenever he rose the prophet said that sealed the whole thing when he rose from the dead that proved it now you know satan probably was sitting around well i know he was sitting around he was speaking to them priests he was he was busy that morning that afternoon but whenever he heard jesus say it is finished no doubt he thought okay whoever this man is because i'm gonna read some quotes here but brother graham teaches us that satan all he wasn't quite sure what to think of jesus he could see god in him he could see him being defeated on every turn constantly being cast out his demons and things but he could see the humanity of him and it really confused the devil so no doubt that whenever jesus cried out it is finished and he bowed his head and died satan thought okay whoever he was he's gone i killed him just like i did the prophets i i i s you know i killed isaiah and i got job and i got moses and i got this one whoever he is he did the most damage to my kingdom than anyone else so far but whoever he is he's gone i've got no more to deal with but what he didn't understand is that jesus was just getting started where it looked like he came to an end jesus was just getting started it was just about to get really good you see because satan couldn't understand the virgin birth brother brahm says that when he that but when he met jesus christ he said it is written talking about jesus said it is written that shall not tempt the lord thy god see but then he knew that he was more than a match then he didn't understand the virgin birth satan didn't but he couldn't understand that but there was one that was one time that god pulled it over on him then was when he had the virgin birth because satan all them rumors they said that she actually mary got pregnant the roman soldier and i don't know there's just so much there's humanity but yet there's something different about him i can't make him fall like i could moses i tempted him with temper but i couldn't quite get him there i tried to tempt him with lust and i couldn't quite get him there like i did david or i tried this that or the other so he knew there was something different about him but i love how the prophet said that is that is one time that god was able to pull one over on him you talk about humility satan is a shrewd fellow he had all these sick he had all those what 4 000 years to study humanity and god was still able god still he always out with the devil the holy ghost in you were out with well out with that old slew foot too you can't outwit them within your flesh brother you we cannot outsmart the devil but the holy ghost will lead you and just confuse the enemy satan will set a trap for you here and the old boy looks like you just headed right toward it he looks like there's just no other way out and the holy ghost would just lead you right here all around the trent and the devil how in the world did he not get in that trap you would have because satan knows you he knows your weaknesses he knows he knows your dna he knows your family history he knows your family history oh way better than you do he's been watching them he's been watching their weaknesses and he knows what weaknesses that you have in your humanity but the holy ghost in you will lead you right around the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord brother graham dramatized in here that whenever jesus was going up the cross he still wondered he wondered just what that was was that a prophet or was that really god he didn't know he didn't know then that god had to be made flesh and dwelt among us one day a roman soldier put a bandage around his face took a read and hit him on the head and said now if you be a prophet if you be this prophet tell us who hit you still he couldn't answer because he had been minding the devil oh the cross they asked him let me just say this you can be at work you can be at school and there could be a little tormentor that you have on the job and they and they could be asking you why do you have long hair why do you have a dress and you know that they're not really interested they just want to just make fun of you you don't have to answer them you don't know if they're interested tell them of the hope that lies within you never be ashamed to witness but when they're just one of them people on the job that you just have to commit to the lord you know you don't have to explain everything to them jesus didn't clown for the devil just if you've got a gift in your life and and they and you know you can sing beautifully brothers or sisters and and they try and get you to sing some worldly song you don't have to sing some worldly song for the devil you don't have to clown for the devil so going up the hill to calvary satan still wasn't satisfied that that was god emmanuel the virgin-born son of god i would say one of satan's biggest mistakes is letting jesus get to the cross you know you think satan was all about crucifying him crucifying him he'd anoint he'd anoint the priest he'd anoint this person he'd anoint that person he anointed the roman soldiers to do what they did to him and all these things because he was satan was trying to get rid of jesus but in fact his greatest mistake is letting jesus go all the way to the cross you see how he outsmarted the devil well satan could not wait to actually crown kill this jesus the very thing that satan thought he actually won it was his very defeat because if jesus didn't go all the way you couldn't have the holy ghost you couldn't get the new birth you couldn't be justified sanctified and filled with holy ghost we wouldn't have this message so god paul really did pull one over on him and such humility so after jesus said it was finished satan found out in a very short order that he wasn't just a prophet he found out very short when he heard a knock on hell remember whenever brother bram dramatizes that and he opens that door and he sees jesus i thought i killed you i thought i had you and i had job i thought i had you and i got moses i thought i had you i had you but he found out real quick that he made a big mistake because not only did jesus still show up he dropped your sins and my sins right on the devil in hell where they belong okay so now all of our sins all your past and everything is now attributed to the devil who's the father of all sin who's the father of all eyes and you're perfect so whenever jesus he proved that not only did he pay the full price not only did he raise from the dead but then he actually went and took the keys of death hell and the grave he went there and he conquered hell for you hell still exists hell is a real place but you don't have to go there because he paid the price of hell for you he went there for you he deposited your sins and my sins onto the enemy and the devil is now responsible for your past sins that's under the blood of jesus that's something to shout about you're no longer responsible for it what's under the blood and what's gone is now attributed to the devil that makes me happy that makes satan mad but that makes me happy so everything that jesus died for becomes your personal property you didn't pay for it he paid for it but yet it belongs to you he paid the full price because we couldn't pay the price we couldn't afford redemption we couldn't afford the blessings of god but he paid the full price and because he's now our boaz he then gives it to his family you don't have to pay for it anymore it's already paid for you see david and abraham and boaz they paid full price for things but their families were then assured abraham's the rest of this family was bit was able to be buried in there at no cost because abraham already paid full price for it there was no question on what what happens if all of a sudden somebody comes and tries to take it back abraham had the title deed to that piece of property that everyone that was buried there had a right to be buried there and that is why that was in a geographical location but we now bury saints in christ jesus which is a spiritual because we know that when he raises or he rose from the dead but we know at his coming they're going to raise from the dead because he holds the title deed to life he holds the title deed to resurrection he paid for it so everything that's in here is yours like you hear salvation is free it is for you but it wasn't free for him he paid dearly for it but see you paid just like we you know we have to as as husbands and as as as fathers and mothers you have to pay for things for your family but when your children are living with you they live there for free until they get to a certain age right but but generally and then people have their own ways but generally i'm trying to say is that little children live there for free now that house that that you live in brother bob was not free unless you got a better deal than i did it wasn't free but yet to zoe and to kaylee they're not aware of the cost they they live there because their dad paid the price whether it was easy to pay the mortgage or hard to pay the mortgage he paid the price and so they enjoy the benefits they enjoy the shelter they enjoy things you see now that is just we know a natural comparison to spiritual things all these things you remember he talked about if you tell me to make yourself at home you go open the fridge you go lay down on the couch that's why he preached doors to the heart is because jesus because some people try to just open just a little bitty door and you can only go here you know you have it roped off you sometimes go in these old houses or museums and they've got private access personnel only you know whatever you can only go through certain areas but whenever counting the cost we want to make a full surrender we don't just want him to be our savior we want it to be our healer our deliverer we want him to be our god now many people in history have died slow and grueling deaths but you know one of the most grueling the most grueling part about jesus's death was your sins and my sins on him jesus died of a broken heart because once he lived and he died but when he resurrected that enabled him to send the holy ghost back to you without her that's how you know that he rose from the dead is because you have the holy ghost without the holy ghost you really don't know but whenever you meet him face to face in the baptism of the holy ghost and you don't have to see him it's called face to face as an expression but you know it and let me tell you something young people or you know my brothers and sisters whenever you really really meet him there's no denying that you met him there's no denying to yourself wherever you may be you could be in your bedroom you can be in church and you can be praying and when he comes by there's literally no denying you may not be able to see but you know that he's there and you know that god is having a conference with you and you know that you're it's your time now people it's important that we take the opportunities that we have because many times that god is so willing he's so willing and full of grace and compassion and he'll come and he'll try and he'll come and reach out and call on people but then you have got to make a full surrender and don't draw back god is willing so when you make a full surrender you're certain that you met jesus christ in the power of his resurrection and then once that life enters into you then your brothers and sisters in your local assembly can then see the change as well because it's life and don't get all confused and worried and get complexes that you got to just become so spiritually mature overnight it's a growth process but at least you're born well as soon as soon you know i mentioned our baby on the way as soon as he's born he's in the family he gets the protection he gets the love he gets the shelter he gets everything the other ones get but they now he won't be able to do the responsible things that others do but he's in the family and then it's time to eat and then it's time to grow and as as these different brothers get up and they preach the unadulterated word to you you eat you feast and you grow but you have to eat you've got to but it's all based on love it's all based on love because we know that jesus was a type of that scapegoat in the old testament when the priests would they'd have two goats one would go free and he the one that transferred the sins of the entire entire nation of israel onto a goat and let him go in the wilderness that's what that's what he did for us my goodness you know we can never praise him enough you can never never worship him enough you can never say thank you enough we'll never on the other side we will never quit worshipping him it'll never just get yeah we we've been here a couple million years and yeah jesus saved us oh no the difference is you can get tired here you get worn out or you know the light may just go out of you or you get over there it just goes on and on and on and on because he's so worthy and in his flesh and in his body he leaves the memorials in his hands and in his side or when he's speaking or he or he he's talking to you and and you know you're gonna get think of this you're going to get a personal audience with jesus christ people of the world they may line up to have an interview with the president or with this politician or with this earthly king but you're gonna get a one on one meeting with him and you you know thank god there's no time you don't have to be antsy oh you know i wish they'd hurry up there won't be that you'll be back there praising them but when it's your time you take all the time because he's done so much for us he's done so much for us that is why that blessed him says when we've been there ten thousand years it's as if we just begun amen because in his presence there's fullness of joy in his presence if you have a difficult time expressing worship and thanksgiving everybody has got a different way of worshiping everyone has a different way of expressing their love but if you have a difficult time telling the lord thank you telling the lord i love you and worshiping him from your heart then you should check your experience because out out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and i'm not saying that you should be running around the church every server so that you should be speaking i'm not trying to set it as any evidence and i'm not trying to pump anybody up i'm just making it as a statement there can be the bible even says that they bowed their heads and they worship you don't have to say a word but you're worshiping god the glory of lord the glory of god is fallen on you in the service baptizing you with the holy ghost and no one else can be aware of it your neighbor's not aware of it but yet the presence of god is falling on you because you are in an atmosphere of worship you know i was fellowshipping with brother bob and i'm gonna have to to bring this here to a landing and maybe pick it up this afternoon but when you think about worship as the word is going forth and it's bouncing off of your souls or coming into you not bouncing off as it's coming into you and you're analyzing and you hear the brother preach about predestination you you hear the brother preach about the love of god you hear the brother preach about healing you hear whatever it is the word you then begin to think back he's preaching about healing man i remember i used to be sick the doctor said i was incurable i used to have this condition i used to have that condition but i don't anymore the brother is preaching about salvation man i remember when i was an absolute punk now i'm not that way anymore you know maybe maybe they're preaching about predestination you think about your family history and how maybe you just came from you know the prophet himself kept being ashamed of of the lineage he came from the bootleggers and the branhams he was ashamed of that but yet whenever he began to think and realize that he in fact and brother bob dealt with this a little bit this morning but whenever he in fact wasn't the son of charles and ella branham once he realized that that then that then gave him a new look on life so speaking back to worship as the word goes forth and you realize and you think and their salvation is being preached or predestination man i used to be but god brought me through then the word should bring forth a worship and you know whenever you're worshiping god you're then saying thank you lord you know he's preaching about predestination and i come from such a lineage of and we all did i don't care if if queen elizabeth is your great-grandmother or whatever you know you still you still come to our lineage is no good but there's no telling what's off our back and and the sin and the debauchery but yet as as as the word begins to go forth about predestination you begin to realize god i came from this my grandparents were this way my own parents are this way or whatever may be and then it begins to give you a worship lord i'm the only believer in my family but then it begins to give you a worship as the word comes forth you identify yourself with that word that then becomes true worship that lord i used to be a scoundrel but because as his brother is preaching it begins to water the the change that god has done in your life i'm not that way anymore so then it begins to bring forth a worship and that kind of worship is very pleasing unto the lord it's not put on it's not so so-and-so sees you it's not because the camera sees you or whatever it may be it's because it comes from the heart and you worship god as a way of thanksgiving we all have something to worship god for if just the fact that we're here breathing just the fact that we're here living and that we're under this word is enough to praise him from now until forever amen there's worship and god looks for those jesus said to worship him in spirit and in truth this word is worth selling out to this word is worth everything get rid of everything else that's of lesser value and just attain this great pearl we found this great pearl you've heard about this pearl at this church alone for decades every sunday and every wednesday that pearl is just shine look at this church look how beautiful this pearl is turn it this way and then and then you know brother gets up here and he he shines it real good and then one of the other brothers get up behind him on the next service and they turn that pearl a little bit more they say look at this and it glistens and it all works together it's a fivefold working together to bring about and to magnify the lord jesus christ this pearl of great price it's all the same word and it magnifies and it just it just turns the diamond or maybe turns the pearl at a different angle but that pearl of great price is so beautiful everything else is worth selling out for and as we close this morning if there's anything in our lives that would keep us from making a full committal if we still have some doors that are locked if we have some little no trespassing or maybe we have some ribbon and we want jesus in just this area of our lives maybe we want him you know in in our relationship maybe we want him in our finances maybe we want him here or there but it's not fully open to where lord jesus come into my heart and if you see anything if you like anything if there's anything i can give you if there's a talent that i have if there's if if i can sing if i if i can and you don't have to just sing like like you don't even have to have talent just make a joyful noise to the lord but if there's something that you can use lord take it if you can take my hands and play an instrument take it lord you see it laying on the table maybe you know maybe if you see that that my feet stay at home too much and maybe you know you don't i don't go to the house of god like i should or maybe my feet stay home or i don't i don't pray enough take them and use it take my hands and use them for your kingdom maybe they're just laying laying around but use them lord if you see anything because remember the prophet typed the queen or somebody coming and they seen something that she wanted and how you would just give it to her that is a very very profound sermon we want to give it all because he did he paid the full price the brother tells us that he would even bankrupt all of heaven amen you think about that he would bankrupt all of heaven to make sure that his word don't fall to the ground so get that checkbook this morning we all have things to write out for we all had things right for and he paid for it it's free to us the only thing that he requires is faith it's like a receipt to prove when the check when you hand the check in a lot of times you get a deposit slit to prove it's been deposited and that's what you have to hold on to so if you deposit a thousand dollars to cover the rent 2 000 to cover your mortgage or whatever you've got the proof that okay i just deposited my paycheck so when i write a check for my mortgage i can be confident that one will cover the other because they confirmed to me that the money is in the bank so whenever you write out the check to the bank of heaven you have your faith you have the token to show that what you requested has been sent in to the bank of heaven and it will be honored if you've got faith there's no such thing as bounce checks in heaven there's no such thing he paid the full price so you could go free brother tells us the story about that crow i think it was johnny crow i forget exactly what he what he called him how he was free and that farmer tied him to that stake and then one day he was let loose but he still thought he was still tied and that's what this world is full of is poor souls that are in bondage but there's been a way made but they've got to come through that way amen god bless you let's stand to our feet let's go to the lord in prayer do you love the lord this morning the gracious heavenly father lord we thank you father lord for this day thank you lord for your people here thank you lord for the opportunity lord that we can have and and share your word father with people that believe and are hungry for the word of god lord thank you most of all for you father that has made that the reason that this church is even here the reason that i'm even here the reason that any of us are even here is because you went all the way we

and father lord if there's any of us here lord that i've had any door locked whatsoever we unlock it now in the name of jesus and unlock it because lord remember that painting when jesus was knocking at the door but it took the person on the inside there was no latch it took the person on the inside to open the door so father in the name of jesus we unlock and open every door of our heart to you that you'll come in and if you see anything that maybe needs to be cleaned up clean it father if there's anything that you can take that from us that you can use for your glory and your kingdom

sister is here for a purpose too to come to you father and lord we've all been wayward children we've all had our conversation as paul said in times past and the lust of the flesh we've done things wrong lord but father you come down in the still of the night and said come home child stop running stop trying to run away from me because you're mine lord i pray that you call her name and that
