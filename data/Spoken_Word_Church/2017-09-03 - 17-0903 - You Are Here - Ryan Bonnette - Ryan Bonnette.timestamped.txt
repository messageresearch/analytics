[2:49] Lord and those that have not sought the
[2:52] Lord nor inquired for him to come to

[6:14] indignation even all my fierce anger for

[6:38] trust afraid the Lord has taken away by
[6:59] judgments have cast out the enemy the

[7:26] he will joy over thee with singing
[7:30] [Music]
[7:39] people
[8:09] today what I'm talking about is you are
[8:12] here by the way make an illustration
[8:14] about this when you go station down
[8:16] sender wakes something about the mall
[8:19] directory when you're in a mall you want
[8:21] to get somewhere you go to the directory
[8:22] and it says you are here you have to
[8:24] know either read to know how to get
[8:26] where you're going that's you know where
[8:27] to start from
[8:28] you don't have a little star or the doer
[8:33] is really small at home I'm going to put
[8:35] a map on that with an appropriate but
[8:37] you know you know about anyway so I want
[8:41] to reiterate something from my last
[8:42] lesson - I think I'm out of stepped on
[8:44] toes and her feelings when I said
[8:46] something about us thinking we're too
[8:47] dumb I included man that I'm not calling
[8:49] you all dumb I'm just saying a lot of
[8:51] times we make excuses and say that I
[8:54] think I'm too dumb understand be on
[8:55] truck you know my read what I do I dig
[8:58] into the word go does I'm not gonna
[8:59] understand in any way okay well come on
[9:01] fingers
[9:02] I'm just saying that's been a struggle
[9:03] I've had all right he just stop stop
[9:05] that's not mine you just don't stop
[9:07] studying and praying Singhania and now
[9:11] everybody know what steel toe shoes are
[9:17] okay I'm gonna step on toes and I want
[9:21] to take a photo sorry if I hurt your
[9:22] feeling for some things I want to say
[9:23] yeah way that's way it's a more the Lord
[9:26] like this one I'm hard I believe so
[9:28] we're on a wool apologetically all right
[9:33] and I may be increasing to the park
[9:34] that's really I think all the cream of
[9:36] the crop I see you people come to the
[9:38] stomach school when you can you come to
[9:40] vows take lessons you can't come to
[9:41] church message again and but still just
[9:44] consider these things and see if they
[9:45] apply to you okay I would love to see
[9:47] what y'all do y'all seek the Lord and
[9:49] serve the Lord and you strive and that's
[9:50] what I vote okay so I'm not
[9:52] condescending this is to me too
[9:54] yes so the Lord laid that's not my heart
[9:58] here a couple weeks ago they don't mind
[10:00] a lot pertains to my co-workers I've
[10:02] worked with them for well over a decade
[10:04] and never really told most of them what
[10:06] I believe and I had more surrender
[10:08] market recently start way to send the
[10:10] people and handing out tracts and just
[10:12] trying to do one thing is just to get
[10:14] people to seek God because everybody
[10:16] from the bottom rung all the way up and
[10:18] Christianity the people who just are
[10:19] Christians by name only lightning and
[10:22] they got saved when they were a kid and
[10:23] then that was their ticket to heaven so
[10:26] little big then they thought they can go
[10:28] out and do whatever they want live their
[10:29] life cussing drinking and smoking right
[10:31] thank you net for the rapture comes
[10:32] they'll just be sucked out of here and
[10:33] if they die that it's go to heaven well
[10:36] that's not true repentance okay so I see
[10:38] people that work doing that I see a lot
[10:40] of them that are real Christians nominal
[10:42] Christians that have plateaued because
[10:44] they're walking over life let's see
[10:46] in both cases and even on over into the
[10:48] message my point is just try to get
[10:50] people to never stop sitting garbage
[10:52] that's all okay we are in a segment see
[10:59] right over it heard the sermon
[11:01] Satan's evening event said that Satan
[11:05] dominates and where he said his
[11:07] establishment is in religious sense it's
[11:09] not just custom drinking smoking he
[11:11] comes all the way over here to the True
[11:13] Vine and it's very close to the truth--
[11:15] island and causes you to just be one
[11:17] word off okay that's his deception he
[11:20] dominates and that religious realm he
[11:23] doesn't care that much about the people
[11:24] in the bars
[11:25] he's over here with us in church he
[11:27] trying to cause us to lose focus and eat
[11:31] the sea
[11:34] okay so the objective to take is to see
[11:38] the importance of awakening from
[11:39] spiritual sleep and seeing your position
[11:42] in Christ and by seeking camp okay
[11:48] Romans 13:11 and that knowing the time
[11:52] that now is it is not time to a high
[11:57] time to awake out of sleep for now is
[11:59] our salvation nearer than when we
[12:01] believe where you can say first believe
[12:03] in other words when you begin your
[12:05] journey okay you're a lot closer to now
[12:07] than what you were then to our salvation
[12:10] in our case to a body changing director
[12:12] and it's time to awake out of sleep
[12:20] secretin is 11 3 but i fear lest by any
[12:24] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[12:26] through his subtlety so your minds
[12:28] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[12:30] that is in Christ that verse really
[12:34] stands out to me about last time I
[12:35] thought because Satan bills interception
[12:39] and subtlety right but God is not
[12:42] deceptive and just hides and simplicity
[12:44] all right
[12:45] he has a purpose for doing that but he's
[12:48] not a deceiver he's not he does blind
[12:50] like the Jews you know if you say for a
[12:51] purpose for the Gentiles to command for
[12:53] you but he blinds something was awesome
[12:57] or purpose okay
[12:59] but the Tree of Life the fare box is
[13:01] still here waiting on us to seek Him
[13:03] it's not hidden he's not far off
[13:05] you know about this he's not even and
[13:06] I'm heart in the mouth they have a
[13:08] message the Word of God right here
[13:10] waiting on you to be enter okay but he's
[13:13] not entirely simplicity but until you
[13:16] come and and make yourself available to
[13:20] him he'll be hidden to you okay it's
[13:26] asinine now as we protocol read all that
[13:29] ends up tonight a few minutes ago I
[13:31] can't find where on the ground ever
[13:33] preached out of the book of Zephaniah
[13:35] and I'm not good at looking up close you
[13:37] know I only do it pretty much when I'm
[13:39] teaching Sunday school that I just read
[13:41] the message where they go
[13:43] but all the found where he said is F&I
[13:46] is that one timer he said I can find
[13:48] Zechariah tonight as long as I'm trying
[13:50] even mentioned it I don't know why he
[13:52] didn't teach on it or preach on it much
[13:54] but it's there and it has to be revealed
[13:57] it has to be fulfilled so I'm going to
[13:59] use it today and I'm not saying that I
[14:01] have the revelation of everything in the
[14:03] lower Zephaniah I'm only using that as a
[14:05] sort of a blueprint and saying this in
[14:07] the same God the children Israel that he
[14:10] is to us okay so he works in the same
[14:12] way that's all I'm doing
[14:15] being exalted and saying I got the
[14:16] revelation of this I just simply saw
[14:19] something the Lord in with me and if you
[14:23] have your vows trying to uh if you have
[14:27] scope of the Bible now it's only stuff
[14:28] above I'm already snowfields notes on
[14:30] page 9 59
[14:39] that's 959 is on the first chapters of
[14:43] Inaba right there the top Scofield says
[14:46] dis prophet a contemporary of jeremiah
[14:49] exercised his ministry during the reign
[14:52] of Josiah it was a time of revival so it
[14:55] sounds like the time were and now I'm
[14:57] jumping and shouting but the time of the
[14:58] word being or by the restoration work
[15:00] right the urgency and balance being
[15:02] restored so we're in a time of spiritual
[15:04] revival with the world being school but
[15:07] the captivity was impending nevertheless
[15:09] the rapture wealth mistake on the other
[15:12] side of the tribulation was pending
[15:14] right when sefirot once out the moral
[15:17] state which despite superficial revival
[15:19] under Josiah made it inevitable so it's
[15:22] coming soon lesson is coming
[15:24] regardless okay Zephaniah is in four
[15:28] parts and then he goes and breaks it
[15:29] down and part one the coming invasion of
[15:32] nebuchadnezzar a figure of the day of
[15:34] the lord or to say a type of the coming
[15:37] of the lord day of the lord all right so
[15:43] that's that's what we're going to be
[15:45] into the whole book of Zephaniah okay
[15:54] all right I will consume this is f
[15:58] naught 1 3 I'll consume man and based
[16:00] I'll consume the fowls of the heaven and
[16:02] the fishes of the sea and the stumbling
[16:03] blocks with the wicked and I will cut
[16:06] off man from off the land saith the Lord
[16:08] verse 6 and then that are turned back
[16:11] from the Lord and those that have not
[16:13] sought the Lord and are inquired for him
[16:15] where 7 hold thy peace at the presence
[16:19] of the Lord God for the day of the Lord
[16:20] is at hand for the LORD hath prepared a
[16:23] sacrifice and hath made his guest to me
[16:26] I think of wedding supper he bid his
[16:28] guests in the young in the one the
[16:30] gospel drew a couple of my guests he bit
[16:32] his guests and people were found not
[16:34] worthy because they made excuses I've
[16:36] got to stay on Facebook I've got to the
[16:38] regrets Almanac I've got to go to
[16:40] Walmart all this thing brother down
[16:41] refers to those are impeding or
[16:44] hindering us because we do those things
[16:47] instead of spending time with God right
[16:49] hey so will be found not worthy - if
[16:52] we're not careful right to be bitten -
[16:54] this wedding better
[16:58] yeah verse 8 and it shall come to pass
[17:02] in the day of the Lord sacrifice that
[17:04] I'll manage the princes and the King's
[17:06] children and all such as are clothed
[17:08] with strength and peril let's train to
[17:10] peril semi maybe not having on the
[17:13] wedding garment right if you have on
[17:15] some other attire besides the wedding
[17:17] garment the Holy Ghost the word reveal
[17:19] if you have something else on besides
[17:21] that your own ideas your own doctors
[17:23] your own talking us even right here
[17:25] sitting in this church we can still have
[17:27] our own ideas sit against the Word of
[17:28] God
[17:29] yeah that strange apparel is it there a
[17:32] story like that somebody showed up at
[17:33] the wedding supper in the wrong ya
[17:35] environment and somewhere in the Gospels
[17:37] now Jesus I think told the parable I
[17:39] guess terrible huh he said oh yeah and
[17:43] so that'll be sang with us clothed in
[17:47] false doctrine and now there's 12 and it
[17:50] should come to pass at that time that I
[17:52] will search for Islam with candles and
[17:55] punish the men that are settled on their
[17:57] leaves that say in their heart the Lord
[18:00] will not do good neither will he do evil
[18:03] my camp out on that verse for a few
[18:06] minutes let's break that down ok
[18:11] so now right there were says say in
[18:13] their heart what is that they haven't
[18:16] been going out say it out loud they
[18:17] might not even realize they believe it
[18:18] but down in their Park they believe it
[18:21] and they prove it be gone by their
[18:22] actions they stay in their heart no
[18:25] works
[18:25] that's unbelief because they say well
[18:28] the Lord will not give good evil the day
[18:30] of the Lord not here at simulations long
[18:32] ways off the rest of the law my office
[18:34] and some other day all right
[18:35] Louisville not do good or evil and enter
[18:38] these aren't what he called agnostics
[18:40] the people that don't believe in God or
[18:42] the devil
[18:42] typically really be right agnostic with
[18:44] either not them these are believers the
[18:46] church members you'd say and they
[18:48] believe in God
[18:49] they make me come to church and read the
[18:52] bottom of pray every day but somewhere
[18:54] in there that's doing is God and they're
[18:55] saying by their actions of staying on
[18:57] Facebook and staying on you know beers
[18:59] on that whatever you read whatever your
[19:01] thing is energy you know what it is
[19:03] hey I don't throw a Facebook I sell you
[19:05] to too much I need to watch myself on
[19:07] YouTube you know but just the thing is
[19:09] just anything that hinders you you fill
[19:12] in that blank that's what I'm saying
[19:13] yeah okay and really what you're saying
[19:16] to God is off later coming right away I
[19:18] know you're coming someday but not today
[19:21] maybe not tomorrow maybe not for one
[19:23] more years that's what you're saying to
[19:25] God in your heart it's hidden but God
[19:28] knows our hearts least means dregs means
[19:31] sediment and liquid sinks to the bottom
[19:33] right so the definition I looked up
[19:36] refer to wine said if you have to sit on
[19:37] a fit old ferment and I guess the
[19:40] heavier elements will settle at the
[19:41] bottom right so somehow thought has to
[19:44] come and serve us up a little bit what
[19:46] is our dregs
[19:47] what is our sediment in our life it's
[19:50] sin that almost all the draping of
[19:52] cussin I mean no you ladies may all have
[19:54] it we come here with it that's why we're
[19:57] here in church we're trying to be
[19:58] delivered from that
[19:59] we were built to us then something will
[20:01] believe that confusion that
[20:03] misunderstanding whatever it is leaves
[20:05] us that's god's turn us up and delivered
[20:08] us and thanks from those from those
[20:09] things israel sometimes that sentiment
[20:12] will cause us to saw a plateau and will
[20:13] stop going on with god
[20:15] it's been a few times my life where god
[20:16] had to come and really spur me good to
[20:18] get me to going on someone all right
[20:25] let's sit here
[20:27] punish the men that are settled on their
[20:30] leaves that sailing off the world will
[20:31] not do good neither will he do evil I
[20:35] know I had something else to say about
[20:38] that it would probably come to me but
[20:40] let's go on to the next from here now we
[20:44] are born in sands what are this talk
[20:46] about a song if you want which is our
[20:48] unbelief
[20:48] this unbelief Romanians until the word
[20:50] of revealed to us unbelief is what
[20:53] weighs us down spiritually and if we're
[20:55] not careful will cause us to settle on
[20:57] our leads okay just sit down cabbage
[21:00] down camp out plateau whatever you want
[21:04] to call it it's some I did throw down a
[21:11] while ago I've got it for this
[21:18] [Music]
[21:20] okay I'm gonna throw this out there and
[21:22] get a whole lot of time to really think
[21:24] on it but sometimes we have these we
[21:27] hear these feel-good doctrines and all
[21:30] of a sudden we just buy into it and just
[21:31] comes it's just once like we think it's
[21:33] just it feels so good it has to be right
[21:35] you know the seed doctor makes you feel
[21:37] good because someone tells you that you
[21:39] came there in their natural birth with a
[21:40] seed of eternal life laying dormant and
[21:42] then at some point the light strikes
[21:44] that seed and you come to life but it
[21:45] makes you feel good like just God
[21:47] thought so highly of you that you put
[21:49] something you didn't put in someone else
[21:51] okay I believe happens is that lines up
[21:54] with our unbelief would come with
[21:56] unbelief in us and that often sounds
[21:58] good because of your unbelief but when
[22:00] the word is when the true word comes
[22:02] forth it doesn't sound exactly right
[22:04] sometimes at first and you have to think
[22:05] about you pray back said what is there
[22:07] something to that or is it not but it's
[22:09] more simple in it and it makes God not a
[22:11] respecter of persons it's not a filled
[22:13] with a doctrine okay maybe sometimes the
[22:16] reason we feel good about some of these
[22:17] false doctrines and tend to follow a
[22:19] mess because of unbelief on the contrary
[22:22] people say bro down you've confused me
[22:24] what does that mean because the unbelief
[22:28] in you doesn't match what he's saying
[22:30] this because he's telling you the truth
[22:32] does the job of what's in you because of
[22:35] the unbelief that you came with right so
[22:37] you say brother Dale you confuse me he
[22:39] said no I just exposed your confusion I
[22:41] exposed your unbelief you came with it
[22:44] and I'm trying to get you out of it
[22:47] yesterday I was filming you trying to
[22:49] deliver you from that is it a matter of
[22:51] were just wrongly educated or wrongly
[22:54] understood because something I've been I
[22:58] believe wholeheartedly i doesn't brother
[23:00] Dale confuses me every time he says I
[23:02] mean well because of all the
[23:06] indoctrination that I was raised Baptist
[23:08] that yeah wrong and you know I have to
[23:12] think about that but I know we're all
[23:13] coming with unbelief just because of
[23:15] that verse Laurence Sam shakily iniquity
[23:18] spouts remote from Lotter because of the
[23:20] act between Adam and Eve okay and that
[23:22] or not me but Adam in a certain time and
[23:24] especially the fact that even took on
[23:27] the wrong word okay she didn't stay
[23:29] behind fell behind work but I think
[23:32] around I think and then man can correct
[23:38] me if I'm wrong but brother Dale the way
[23:40] he brings out he likes to bring things
[23:41] out sometimes any like riddles to make
[23:43] you think and look you know search
[23:46] things out more because then in the next
[23:48] service he'll add a little bit more to
[23:50] that and you know and lisas over the
[23:52] whole podcast and everything but I yeah
[23:54] but and so that's why a lot of people
[23:56] may think of or they'll confuses me but
[23:58] you sometimes kind of just throw
[24:00] something out there it is I'm gonna
[24:01] confusion it's um I make the analogy
[24:05] with ink that there's this little toilet
[24:07] in my brain that pushes out all the old
[24:09] doctrine you know where my brother
[24:11] Samuel says this and another hard one he
[24:15] says it takes a little while yeah I'm at
[24:17] that total of a flush and get rid of all
[24:19] the garbage you know does it make sense
[24:21] it did late it fills in all the little
[24:24] nooks and crannies it's uh and
[24:28] it's hard to do that well I think most
[24:31] everybody here would agree that when
[24:32] they started coming here it took a long
[24:34] time for me I came out the Baptist
[24:37] Church there's a 17 year old kid
[24:38] straight into the US and I said that I
[24:42] think for a long time my wife she came
[24:44] to your works that wasn't teaching all
[24:46] right doctor we're all gonna start
[24:52] coming in this work yeah the sheriff on
[25:07] your I cuz through words and falsework
[25:10] can't provide it at the same time when
[25:11] the truth comes in the fall slate and
[25:13] then when you when you when you hear it
[25:16] like 10 years ago if I heard that
[25:20] message I say when you drunk you're
[25:22] crazy because of the Baptist and then I
[25:25] went to enjoy it and I met this guy who
[25:28] was a Bible believer and he start
[25:31] teaching I go that's right that's right
[25:33] that's right and then he had a sense of
[25:36] humor and repent just don't have a sense
[25:39] of you and I stayed with him a couple
[25:43] days to learn all this and I got
[25:44] baptized in this little cesspool in the
[25:48] name of Jesus Christ and I I knew this
[25:51] is the way it's gotta be
[25:52] and then I offered him somebody for his
[25:57] time and first church and everything you
[25:58] wouldn't take it would take it so I
[26:00] slipped into my pillowcase and I called
[26:02] him later and he goes all he said would
[26:04] you really think you're funny don't you
[26:07] I think novel areas but since then it
[26:12] went when yesterday who's talking about
[26:16] favorite Bible passages yeah the one
[26:20] about being starved for the word and
[26:22] that one hit me right but I have to say
[26:24] that's my favorite yeah because for the
[26:26] past eight years past for since I've
[26:28] been in Greenville County Pickens County
[26:32] I've been starved for the true word I
[26:34] mean and you and you show them the Bible
[26:36] and they call the police and show them
[26:38] the Bible they start jumping up and down
[26:39] screaming yelling they're all right
[26:42] there and I like to stay home yes and I
[26:47] just I this park I said forget it you
[26:50] want me to go somewhere you fix it yeah
[26:52] and then I went to this I met brother
[26:54] Dale and other things and so non-first
[26:58] well you know that's the same basis I
[27:00] came here honest just count to 10 before
[27:02] you call the sheriff thanks if I can
[27:06] hear only some hundred throats and
[27:07] erogenous
[27:08] yeah that's what I'm you know what you
[27:13] start and you start getting fed that's
[27:17] true yeah you know you discern it it's
[27:20] the Holy Spirit you know because that
[27:22] that discernment comes from the Holy
[27:23] Spirit yeah because I can't do it and
[27:26] you know and that's truth in it it fills
[27:28] all these little holes and pretty soon
[27:30] is drawing and drawing and drawing and
[27:36] I guess you must give it Hitler do it
[27:41] okay
[27:43] that's when I have to - oh well
[27:50] basically I started to say - being
[27:52] patient wait on God that's not mean
[27:54] sitting and doing nothing okay it means
[27:56] you study and pray laughs the word
[27:59] fantasy right about the kind of quick
[28:01] mentee you got to come to a you know
[28:03] mental faith at least a conceptual
[28:05] understanding of the story on the page
[28:07] where to be a message during the Bible
[28:09] or not equipment - okay not to - before
[28:14] the decree bring forth before the day
[28:15] passed as the chaff before the fierce
[28:18] anger of the Lord come upon you before
[28:20] the day of the Lord's anger come upon me
[28:22] seek ye the Lord all unique of the earth
[28:25] which have brought his judgment seat
[28:28] righteousness significance it may be he
[28:30] shall be hid in the day of the Lord's
[28:32] anger after a few more these real quick
[28:40] if you stop singing god you cut off the
[28:42] channel between you and God by seeking
[28:45] after day by reading prayer listen to
[28:46] sermons said early have a constant
[28:48] communion with Christ
[28:52] it's F&I 2:15 this is the rejoicing city
[28:55] that dwell carelessly that said inner
[28:59] heart I am and there is none beside me
[29:01] how has she become a desolation a place
[29:03] for beasts to lie down in every one that
[29:06] passeth by her shall kiss and wag his
[29:08] hand all right this sounds like the
[29:10] Catholic Church or denominational trip
[29:12] because I will say the senator heart
[29:16] they all say I am and there is none else
[29:17] right beside maybe everybody believes
[29:20] that their doctrine is right in their
[29:21] belt so long I thought that is about
[29:23] this kid then but done in the false vine
[29:26] grow grow close to the true heart if we
[29:30] are not careful prayerful militant
[29:32] watchful sincere could this be spoken
[29:34] word church no man the church as a whole
[29:36] but individuals here do we not fall into
[29:38] that situation and here's how I say that
[29:40] can be carelessness not reading and
[29:43] studying pray enough not enough
[29:44] sincerity and we are most inclined of
[29:48] anybody message that I know up to say I
[29:51] am and there is none else you know I say
[29:52] that because brother Dale holds such a
[29:54] straight line of the truth and preaches
[29:56] against false doctrine
[29:57] I sat in that pew ten years ago 15 years
[30:00] ago and I thought I'm safe he's in
[30:03] safety and sudden destruction coming
[30:05] right I thought I'm safe I'll call
[30:07] brother Bill my pastor is keeping me a
[30:09] rock I believe what he says but then I
[30:12] got a face I faced the Faust offering
[30:14] myself for the first time and find out
[30:16] that I don't know what I believe
[30:17] so I began to really seek and study and
[30:19] pray and find out what I believe in
[30:21] not just taking on my pastor set so
[30:23] you'll say in your heart
[30:25] pride goes before fall you'll say in
[30:28] your heart I am and there's none beside
[30:30] me I feel cozy here in my little queue
[30:32] listen to my pastor fight it out with
[30:34] these false doctrines and I sit down and
[30:36] I say I'm okay because I'm if he goes
[30:38] I'm going you know so a place for me to
[30:43] lie down on him what kind of Beast will
[30:45] come in you if you get in that position
[30:47] you come to sanctification the unclean
[30:50] spirit goes out of a man
[30:51] he's secrets rest he walketh belton and
[30:53] he can't find rest he comes back and
[30:55] brings $700 worth of himself and the
[30:57] last day that man is worse than the
[30:59] first it comes to sanctification he sits
[31:00] down he's not filled and sealed for the
[31:03] Holy Ghost he sits down and he's got a
[31:05] religious spirit or a lot of really the
[31:07] spirits those are me according to this
[31:10] verse those are the base that will lie
[31:12] down take up residence in you because
[31:14] you didn't go on simple as that
[31:16] I got the really hurry up
[31:28] well to her that is filthy and polluted
[31:31] to the oppressing city she'll beg mount
[31:32] the voice she received not correction
[31:35] she trusted not in the Lord
[31:37] she drew not near to her God did we
[31:40] follow this category by lacking
[31:42] sincerity
[31:49] Zephaniah 3.4 then will I turn those
[31:51] people that pure language that they may
[31:54] call all call upon the name of the Lord
[31:56] to serve him with one consent what would
[31:59] that be pure language what's that semi
[32:03] pure language pure means playing holy
[32:06] unadulterated the Lord brought us a
[32:09] message pitched on Christ
[32:11] unadulterated pure word of Almighty God
[32:13] in this hour a pure language that they
[32:17] may all call upon the name of the Lord
[32:18] to serve and on one consent one heart
[32:20] one mind one Accord if we can come to
[32:22] the unity of the faith and believe the
[32:23] message is available we just have to dig
[32:25] into it it's here ok John 15:7 if you
[32:28] invited me and my word abiding you ask
[32:30] what you will and it shall be done unto
[32:32] you okay
[32:38] but he works a lot when the confidence
[32:42] come here whom I was sent unto you from
[32:43] the father - even the Spirit of Truth
[32:45] which proceedeth from the father he
[32:46] shall testify of me and ye also shall
[32:49] bear witness because he hath been with
[32:51] him from the beginning where we heard
[32:52] that race brother Dale man brother way
[32:55] always found out the attribute versus an
[32:57] attribute if we received after own life
[33:00] and his worries about even us we were
[33:02] with him from the beginning then by that
[33:04] eternal life okay
[33:05] before it was an attribute there was the
[33:07] attribute propels me say is that the
[33:10] nine three twelve
[33:12] I'll also leave in the midst of thee and
[33:14] afflicted and poor people and they shall
[33:16] trust in the name of the Lord he sounds
[33:18] like the attitudes right the beach will
[33:20] inherit the earth persecute bless or
[33:22] even your persecuted for us to stinky
[33:23] showers leave the team porch spirit so
[33:27] there's a thirteen my dog and then says
[33:30] the master accept an amendment of Israel
[33:31] so not do an equally more speak lies
[33:33] become a deceitful time they found in
[33:35] her mouth their mouth where they shall
[33:37] feed lie down and then shall make them
[33:38] afraid no fear they're not little flaw
[33:46] verse 17 the LORD thy God in the midst
[33:49] of these mighty he will save you rejoice
[33:51] overly with joy
[33:52] he'll rest in his love he will joy over
[33:54] they were singing once I get two more
[33:57] punch there we go okay basically there's
[33:59] two things I want to get across out of
[34:02] these quotes a brother Brennan okay you
[34:09] can actually read frame from the church
[34:10] listen reads from it and still be
[34:12] missing your day that's something that I
[34:14] was doing for a long time we must have
[34:16] more sincerity and desire for more
[34:17] thought you're really bizarre more of
[34:19] him he was showing by your actions you
[34:21] cease whether you really sticking or not
[34:23] okay I just gave basically two quotes
[34:26] one about sincerity one about why you
[34:28] can be sincerely wrong thank you the
[34:30] work is the main thing the word but
[34:32] we've lost the interest it takes a
[34:34] circumcision of the holdings of the
[34:36] Spirit to bring life there's work some
[34:38] serious going away it's been a time that
[34:39] we've noticed the great sincerity when a
[34:41] man knows that it's wrong for these
[34:43] things to creep them to stir and then
[34:45] don't tell them about it where is that
[34:46] beeps in Syria okay let me skip on ahead
[34:51] to one that's about the other side and
[34:54] sincerity alone will not work it
[34:56] requires going on with God if you are
[34:59] sincere to me it it sort of gets God's
[35:01] attention said hey I'm doing what you
[35:03] said to do then he comes to you with
[35:04] more work do you walk into it or not
[35:06] okay because Cain was sincere
[35:08] Mabel is nice here Cain was not accepted
[35:11] because his offering was not right for
[35:13] the revelation today we'll have Abel
[35:15] tried to correct came God said once you
[35:16] be accepted if you come I think so he
[35:18] had the opportunity I think he didn't do
[35:21] it
[35:21] he said this is it take earlier you stop
[35:24] right there and be sincerely wrong okay
[35:32] let's get them down to one one before
[35:44] that
[35:45] before this yeah I'm sorry - yeah so if
[35:51] God just respects worship sincerity
[35:54] sacrifice came was just as dust disabled
[35:56] but if it was by revelation that he
[35:59] understood but it was by revelation that
[36:02] he understood that it was not apples
[36:04] that his parents okay that's what I got
[36:09] a really really quick question about
[36:10] that's why these are so mean and hateful
[36:16] I think they know that their dogma is
[36:18] breaking down and everything they
[36:21] believed in is breaking down because if
[36:24] you ask them a question they don't know
[36:26] because they only know this they only
[36:29] know what is sent to them and no
[36:30] subscriptions you know and that they
[36:33] know and that's making a beam so it
[36:34] ain't gonna be long and they're gonna
[36:36] collapse and then their face
[36:57] [Music]
