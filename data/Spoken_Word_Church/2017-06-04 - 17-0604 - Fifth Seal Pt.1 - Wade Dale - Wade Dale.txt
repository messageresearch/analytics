TRANSCRIPT
========================================
record record thank you there we go all [Music] right everybody doing good nobody listening no no okay all right today we're going to start on the fifth seal now we want I've already got some things written down here but let's just back around just for a minute oh I want you to um remember brother Claude he has prostate cancer but it's only stage one they're not going to check him for another year so he's not worried about it but just keep him in your prayer because uh when you say that word you know kind of worries you a little bit humanly it worries you a little bit so but he had stage one no PSA High nothing they found it by doing an MRI on his on his uh hip because his hip was hurting so they find he was in it was inlarged so they did some biopsies and two of the came back with cancer cells so but they're like I said they're not worried about it right now must not be for another year you know so just keep them in your prayer though uh now we're going to start the fifth seal but now the fourth seal I want you to remember now the fourth seal is the rapture seal right the Rapture takes place on the four seal so we've got I want you to pay attention to what's Happening Here 1 2 3 and four happens where when the angel told John said come and see he had to be brought somewhere right right come and see John John come and see look over here it says in number four and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth be say come and see when he had opened the third seal I heard the Beast say come and see so what John is going he is going where that angel is telling him or that combat Beast is telling him to go all right he's being led by the Holy Ghost is that all right he's being led by the Holy Ghost and being led by the Holy Ghost John has to go see he says come and see so John must have had to step into something now but remember when we come to the fifth seal now when he says when he opened the fif seal I saw there was no combat Beast to say come and see there was no nothing what it happened all four of the combat Beast are in this dimension this Dimension this is where the Holy Ghost is at now is in this Dimension where we are now this is where the lonox man and Eagle is working is in this Dimension sure we know it's another dimensional um supernatural being cuz he can be in you me and somebody in Africa at the same time so we know he's we know he's traveling through Dimensions faster than we can blink an eye but these to get the to to get the Gest of these seals you got to see that God come down into this Dimension to get a group of people okay now and he's took them all in the Rapture right right here took them all in the Rapture the the L the justification sanation baptism the Holy Ghost and the word being made known even to John John it does not have it's not that John doesn't have need of that combat Beast or need of someone to lead him in he's come to a position to where God can speak straight to him you understand what I'm saying he's using he's using these combat beasts come and see John come here I want to show you something step into this John must be in now another dimension and he's staying there okay because look these souls are not in this Dimension right at all right they're in another dimension okay they're in a dimension apart from us so John Say by his Revelation there's no combat Beast to lead John anymore John has become the Holy Ghost wait with me and you right amen he's not a third person of the Trinity he is the person of Jesus Christ what that's your new birth personally to you all right it's you and God in there as persons not not separate I thought we were supposed to Vulcan be so vulcanized that you can't tell the difference between the Holy Ghost and you I thought that's what we were supposed to come to adoption and all those great things that we're coming through well that's what like we're talking about last night you've got to come through adoption before you can understand the fullness of the seal brother B had to come to the fullness of adoption before you can understand the SE the revelation of the seals all right sure you can get bits and pieces but to get that full opening of the word of God you must come to a place to where God can say right here with John you got to listen to what John say I saw look how personal it is now I saw and all the other ones it says John come and see another not another person but someone else is grabbing John and saying come here I want to show you something now in the fifth seal Everything Changes that's why the prophet of God knew that the Rapture took place on the fourth seal the bride goes up because this is not to the bride in this dimension right cuz we're gone right we're not in this Dimension John is physically not in this Dimension okay sure he's waiting and all you understand what I'm saying but he's not he's not in this Dimension we're in now he has stepped into another dimension and he did it the God took him into that Dimension because of remember he was commissioned to write but I believe John there was some things he did see I saw so he saw with his eyes so he goes to another dimension where there is a group of one group of people we talking about dimensions a little bit last night and it's really easy but it's really hard M all right cuz it is it's really easy you got you got seven dimensions we know there's only one person in this one Jesus Christ alone with a glorified body done this Dimension this is what God alone that's what brother Brown you know brother rown said can I see Jesus he said no he's a little higher why he's standing there with a glorified body there's no one got a glorified body except Jesus at this moment what about anoch you answer that I'm just telling you the Bible says only one person is reach immortality cuz remember when brother Brown went to that sixth Dimension sure they were Immortal Souls but they weren't Immortal Souls in flesh all right they got to come back here to get their flesh body so that six Dimension would be what only bride now you say only that excludes but just let's just say bride this is what you and I live in this is right now we know what four is four is Radio TV demons microwaves demons oh you know they all travel in the fourth Dimension right but it's really not a place it's just out there so The Fifth Dimension the prophet of God said was the Sinners so you got to put them in one of them seven okay all right and we'll get into this I'm working gradually because I'm going to tell you something I don't want to do like one brother last year used circumstantial evidence Pro something I want to have some evidence backing me up but you got to remember brother BR didn't speak too much about what was inside these Dimensions except for what he saw when he went there because there is truth to one thing these people right here white robes were given so they they did not have white robes when they died okay so then they didn't have the Holy Ghost when they died they could not go in this Dimension they could not go in this dimension they definitely are not in this one and they're not in that one so there's got to be a piece in here somewhere what we've been talking about overlap an overlap there's an overlap somewhere where these people are preserved but they can't you got that's why you got to do like brother Dell always say you got to you got to say okay do it by process of elimination they can't be in that one they can't be in that one and they're definitely not radio waves are demons okay so they got to be somewhere around that Fifth Dimension and they're a special group of people we'll talk about that in just a second so let's just look at all these no combat beef all right let's read the seal and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of that now remember brother BR so this see this would be the now what is on the altar it's blood sacrifice amen that everybody knows that under that altar is a blood sacrifice all right covers I I thought brother said it covered everybody right now we're all covered under the blood all right but when you pass away you go somewhere under here I'm just putting people right Christ is here and then even brother randam in the sixth Dimension which was the bride he said that was Souls under the or the angel told him that was so under the altar right right so you got the altar then this is what I see that you got your sixth Dimension real close to that cuz these people don't need Redemption anymore they're already passed from Death unto life they're already in Eternal bodies but these people were not okay when they died they didn't have eternal life in their soul the only people that go in that sixth Dimension is people that die with eternal life in their soul because brother Ram asked that angel said what is this he said this is perfect love perfect love can't be in The Fifth Dimension it can only be in the sixth Dimension all right so these are souls Under The Altar and they have a I'm sorry but this is the only way I can say it they have an attitude cuz these right here under the Sixth Dimension are not sitting there crying how long how long to avenge our blood that's not their attitude that's not their attitude there's no avengeance in that sixth Dimension they didn't walk up brother around and say ah bless God I wish I heard him get back cuz I so I can you know do away with the guy that killed me no but these do because they're what they're all Jewish right okay but white robes were given to them okay now watch I so Al to The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now listen they did not have the testimony of Jesus Christ no remember all Jews 99.9% of the Jews don't believe Jesus was was the Savior almighty God Messi whatever you want to say okay so you're looking at a group of people that had a testimony if you read your fifth seal which I want you to do read that fifth seal the testimony they held was they're Jews we're God's chosen people we're Jews we're God's chosen people rejected the Messiah but we're God's chosen people and brother brand said that is their testimony which they H there is no testimony see these right here in the sixth Dimension they have the testimony of Jesus Christ cuz Jesus Christ is the one to put them in that Dimension the blood of Jesus Christ put them in that sixth Dimension them accepting the blood and it cleansing them on this side on this side in the three dimensions over here put them in the sixth Dimension a place brother B said you don't even want to come back to this one all right it was so glorious and so wonderful all right now look but he said this group of people they CED with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true does shall not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth brother said that's not the bride the bride doesn't yell for judgment the bride yells for Mercy right so you've got a group of people that's under the altar right here fifth SE of Jew they're still under the blood sacrifice the blood altar but they're not like that the bride the sixth Dimension people no cuz what and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants let's go back up here let's go back to 1 2 and three dimension right anybody got that they should rest for a little see until their fellow servants now what is their F servants and Brethren that has to be Jews okay yeah right that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled got that until their fellow servant so they're going to be killed so I got they got to be killed somewhere and put in here now watch you got to also remember too brother random one place he talks about Ian and Hitler what you know they killed 6.8 million Jews see those Jews were killed because they were Jews right right that's right they didn't have a testimony of Jesus Christ they were killed because of Jews they're in that fifth seal you I believe because that's what the prophet of God said he said killed under Amman and Hitler but you can still go all the way back far as you want to cuz the Jewish Community remember after after ad30 they still believe the Messiah was coming right they believed it so much so in ad70 40 years later kidus comes in and destroys them Slaughters them because they thought God was still in the temple so they run back into the city of Jerusalem Titus surrounded them and they had to eat their own children bark off the tree because they rejected the Messiah but they were Jews right right they're all Jews and then now the Jews in 8070 they were dispersed uh throughout all the all the world you can't tell which ones Judah and Ephraim and Manasseh you can't tell the tribes but God knows where they at the great scientist God Almighty that has all the DNA of the world of all the people knows exactly where each one of these tribes are cuz he's getting ready to call after we leave here see after we leave here MH see this this couldn't happen until we left that's right God's not dealing with two people at the same time he deals with the Gentiles amen sure people look there's Jews in here there's Jews that receive the Holy Ghost and being the bride okay but remember the the ones that give their life for their testimony that they held which we are Jews we are God's people cuz look they were slain for the word of God they believe in the word of God the Torah the the old they believe in that can explain it more than you and I can but they don't have the Holy Ghost in their soul because God blinded their eyes god what the prophet God said God blinded their eyes so that you and I could come in amen and we'll read it probably or I won't be here next Sunday but the next Sunday Ryan's doing next Sunday um we'll look at where in in Ezekiel and Jeremiah they said where did you get those scars he says in the house of my friend and they say oh we're in bad shape we're in bad shape we we have rejected the Messiah he said no don't worry he said it was done not for you it was done in other words for the Gentile paraphrase it was done to bring a people in look I you take that Daniel 70 weeks and you you got church ages here right you got what happened here which is 69 weeks and then you got one week left after the Rapture right right right and that's all Jewish that's right now if they would have accepted the Messiah right here that's what would have happened they would have went right on into that 70th week there would have been no Gentiles saved and they would have went right on cuz look that Millennium is to who them that's right brother Brown said what was injected that Wild Olive Branch the Bible says was what the the Gentiles were grafted in right there's your grafting it was grafted into that tree and the reason we were grafted in cuz right here God what he blinded the eyes of the Jews but he's given them one more week which is 3 and 1/2 years of ministry plus 3 and 1/2 years to put us in the Millennium we've already been through that but they get that last Ministry of Jesus Christ right here to redeem them and take them out of here now that's not talking about this group though that's right different group that's right cuz remember the 144,000 they receive eternal life here that's right that's right so that's another group you got to section all that off but this fifth seal Jew are the Jews that are that have died under persecution of ikan Hitler and even back whenever uh you may even consider the excuse me the ones that uh Titus but I have a problem with that is because they turned they turned God down while he was on Earth so but you know what I leave that up to God this group right here the prophet of God said was all the persecuted Jews okay so this is a certain group of people yes this is not Nations this is not Gentiles this is not anybody but Jewish so it's all Jewish that's why you got you Daniel 70 weeks 69 weeks they rejected the Messiah and then there's 3 and a half years left of ministry 1260 days Ministry of two prophets to bring in not a whole not a whole not all jewelry not all not jewelry jewelry jewelry jewry to bring all to not bring all jewelry no when that you know who's going to persecute this 144,000 their own brethren the Jews they're going to persecute them you know why because the 144,000 are going to look at all the all the jewelry look at all the people in Israel remember CU they'll establish Temple worship when they got that when that contract is signed right here with the pop the beast that's a 7-year contract and the Bible says in the middle of that contract he'll break it well for this 3 and 1/2 years they're going to go back to Temple worship Rome's going to give them all their stuff back cuz Tyler stole them all when he took them out he took he he took the temple apart took the Manara holy of holies he took they took everything out well they're going to give it back Rome's going to say hey I'll sign this treaty because you know what we know one thing for sure when Satan makes a treaty or or a contract it's usually very one-sided on his side okay so that's what the RO Romans going to say look we want this if you want this you got to give me this so that's what's going to happen then what he's going to do is God's going to call out 144,000 during this time but what about them old staunched Jews they said hey guys we got this thing back to where we're supposed to have it we waited for 2,000 years we're back to Temple worship and Moses and Elijah the spirit of Moses and Elijah walks into the temple and says your God's not here God's not anywhere around this place they're going to hate them people and then 144,000 is just like me and you in the denominations we were in or the mess that we were in okay come out of her my people there was a message that called us out right right right and why do we now to the denomination of the world we're quacks CS they don't understand us why because and you know the Baptist says we're right Methodist says we're right Pentecostal said we're right and you're wrong and then we're standing on this s side saying no we have the right message that's what the Jews are going to say so who so who's going to persecute us the people closest to us always persecute you all right so that's what's going to happen here is is they're going to be persecuted by a group of people right in their own City cuz listen like we covered in the Daniel 70 weeks at this time right here the world the Gentile world is going to be in turmoil right they ain't going to care about two prophets because them two prophets are not to them now they will get the residual effect from it earthquakes tornadoes they'll get the residual effect from it the whole world will but they're not going to they're not going to send the CIA or the FBI over there if there is anyone left by them they're not going to send the CIA or the FBI to kill them because the Bible says they're killed by their own people that's right okay they'll be killed in the streets of Jerusalem so who's going to kill them somebody from maybe the Messi or something is going to kill him so you understand so it's not the whole world worrying about him it's just the Jews cuz look God never said he would never forget Israel and that's the same thing right here the testimony they held is we're Israelites we are God's chosen people and God said okay I had to Blind your eyes what to take out a bride and because I'm doing that I'm going to step in and I'm going to do something that I'm not going to to any other group I'm going to give you white robes after you're gone after you're dead I'm my judgment is going to be passed actually it was passed before the foundation of the world but my judgment is going to be passed right here cuz look verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a while in other words stay right where you're at because cuz we got to work 1260 days of this prophecy out right we got to work that out right here once we work that out and then the 144,000 is going to be killed and it was a great Revelation to see like brother Dale was saying that that fifth sealed Jew is going to carry right over in the Millennium because they got white robes right they were giv white robes while they were down here under that under that blood altar cuz look white robes were given and it was said that they should rest yet for a while so they're giving white robes they're put in a rest place then they're going to be resurrected I love that they're going to be resurrected and then go right on into the Millennium because who better knows how to build a temple number one as Jew right and who better to know that that Millennium is to them that's right that's what they're waiting on they're waiting on a millennium they're waiting on that promise of that gold and Jubilee that they never got in the Old Testament the 50 the 50th where everything goes through right right so now there's no combat Beast we see John has moved into another dimension he's not he's not in this Dimension he's got to be able to see into another dimension and see the Altar and the souls under the altar that was slain because of what the word of God the word of God says Jews are my people I'll never forget you as the Sands in the sea and the stars in the sky I'll never forget Israel remember now sure like we were saying last night he was married to them at one time but remember they went horing and he had to divorce them right but that do mean they're not his people cuz that's what Rabbi Richmond said he said he said I can't help it folks I was born a Jew and God loves Jewish people right cuz he started everything through us that's right now whether we messed up down the road or not he still started everything and all of his um examples in the Old Testament of the Jewish lineage that fills the whole Old Testament up but you do see where you come in with a DOT here with Rahab Ruth each one of these little bitty ones that come in here the little Gentiles that is put in there and the Bible does tell in the Old Testament that God will take a people out of Gentiles they'll be Gentiles saved but what they're thinking is see they're switching it around saying okay the messiah's going to come to us he's going to save us take us out of here and and he may take a few of y'all with us I mean really that's what they're thinking we may take a few of them with us you know because of Gentiles or dogs but God has given cuz remember all these other seals power was given to Satan to do something now what God is is God now he's giving white robes Satan can't give white robes that's right there's only one man that can give a white robe white robes were given verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for yet a little while until their fellow servants also and their Brethren they should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so we know one thing's for sure this fifth seal will end sometime after that 1260 day journey of Moses and Elijah preaching to the Israel to I say Israel but Jews um you might say Israelites and Jews are the same thing I don't know but I know one thing God says Jews Jewish the Jewish people and all these people were Jews so there's a place for them and next Sunday or the next Sunday after we'll show you where that place is that there's a place that God has for him in his word because remember this looks like he's a respector of person and the Bible says in many many places that God is not a respector of person but this looks like that God's going to give them something and they've done nothing in return for it they actually laughed at and put him on the cross that's right right that's why he said let his blood be on us and our children that's what put them right here let his blood be on us and our children brother said all down through the generations it throw them into a place to where what God couldn't talk to them no more unless under the message of their hour you understand cuz they are listen there are going to be Jews that are going to be given are no sorry there are Jews now that are bride yeah cuz you got to remember the 120 were all Jews and they were the bride that started then probably some of the 3,000 sure they were nations in different places but then you come up to Cornelius and all in the in the book of Acts that God was dealing with Jews so there's a lot of Jews that's that's not under that this is all Jews that rejected Christ while he was on Earth to a degree cuz boy you have to go back to where brother Brown says word rejectors go to hell and if they turn the word of God down but now remember if they don't know God blinded their eyes BL to the truth you have to see it to so he blinded he literally blind put his hand over their eyes so that you and I could come in right so to honor that he's got to do that to honor to be a just God to to be just that he passed judgment on these people before they were even born and put his hand over their eyes there's one word that that sums all this up and we'll talk about next Sunday it's a little early but let's go ahead and go don't want to get starting something else but pray for me I'll be in New Mexico next week so and brother Ryan will take yeah hey that's a good idea
