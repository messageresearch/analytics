but down regular that regular people good to see everybody in the house of the Lord though remember the announcements this coming Wednesday brother Marcus Becker from Germany will be speaking for us and and the fellowship meeting will be this coming Saturday at brother Tom crochetings remember that we're not going to try to go so if you're going make your plans and do whatever uh remember to pray I know you have a brother Ray and sister Kathy the loss of their son-in-law and member Mary flying in this afternoon and and everything be with each one of them that the Lord would would take care of the families in all of us and uh Mr Francis and the different ones uh also remember now the Fall Festival this year will be on October the 14th down at the uh Place we've been having our you know after school I mean at the uh to change it wasn't clean number 14. orders Rachel when I had it written down as a 14th so I guess whatever it is and we got a long time before then we got to get the baby here first so Rachel once she gets the baby here she'll tell us the dates okay 25th or what okay all right okay all right that'll be good then October yeah so 25th okay so I know I had to put down and I wrote it on my notes and I guess I missed it but yes yeah probably wouldn't be then we okay but anyhow remember the Fall Festival October all right we'll get everything together and have a good time we always do but if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Hebrews 12 where we were this morning to try to continue our thought and remember like sister Gayle and brother dick them traveling back and finishing up Darren getting coming in back home and remember each one of these that the Lord would would bless each and every one Hebrews 12 right the heavenly father we thank you for all things we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for all that you've made manifest into our hearts and our lives and we just ask you to come now and speak to us Lord that your love may be made made to the point that it would be the only thing that we would desire is to satisfy you and your grace and love have your way with each and every one remember those that are traveling remember the different ones and already remember the the Gabriel family there and the loss of the loved one Lord and just have your way forgive our sins and lead us by thy Grace and love in Jesus name amen Hebrews 12. you notice we got out of chapter 11 so we're doing pretty good only took 28 messages to get out of there okay we're foreseeing we also are compassionate about we're so great a clouded Witnesses let us lay aside ever wait and the sin which does easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God you may be seated to where that is blessing to the reading of the word now I hope that we put in enough to get an understanding of what we were talking about this morning and to let you know what I believe at least and the things that I speak of that I believe all back that away as far as you can go back to Adam and as far as you can go over that way to where the lice group would be um probably foolish virgins at the white Throne or something I wouldn't know the last but everything is dependent upon you and I and you say well I just don't know where there's anything going on well that's for me to realize that that ought to make a thrill into our hearts and a thought that Lord we found our place we found Who We Are and we found what you've done you reserve the best to last which is us and his bride is the one that he's putting everything into and that his bride is he himself made manifest so it's not talking about waiting on you and I as peoples or as that it's waiting for to you know him to come and manifest himself Among Us in US all right now because I don't believe anybody can raise the dead I believe it takes God to raise the dead I don't believe there's anybody that the body could be changed I believe take God to change the body you know and all of that but that away see then I can say they without us you know cannot come to a completed state of what they desire to you know in all because of us you know they couldn't come to it but because of us now the opportunity is for them and like I was quoting this morning that wrote around said we fall right in line all right you can't put things in order of you know this or that because here we are in the middle and because of us being here that can take place on past here all right and because of us accepting Christ and becoming what he wants then all that was back there can come forth now I know that that's a thought that's going about I've heard it later other than the ones that we know of that was speaking of the Old Testament Saints you know that they would uh they raised back there totally Body Spirit Soul you know in a in a physical body and I believe the prophet in what he's saying about it but I also believe that you said some other things so I just stay with that until it's revealed and then when it is I don't have to worry about it you know you know but I still say that whatever is totally hinged or dependent upon you and I to become what this Prophet has spoken of to show what he would think of the Bride here in the end time and the position she's in and what age would we want to live in it should be like the prophet said when he said if I was asked what age he said I'd want to live and be in this age all right that should be our desire is to live right here because we're going to see something take place to the bride but now the rest won't you know the biggest portion of the people will never know anything's taking place amen and all that it'll just be right on secret Rapture quiet time and the rest will go right on brought around and said even thinking they're getting a Holy Ghost and things but said the Bridle doesn't be gone well that's all I'm trying to do is to strive for that you know of the point to where you and I will walk off the earth all right now I want to approach something in a way but my point when we get down to the end is what is the worst sin that could be thought of because it said that you and I now Paul's not writing to the world the Bible's not talking to the world it's talking to those that are in Christ Jesus all right and he says there that we are supposed to lay aside every sin which does so easily beset us well what is the worst sin you could think of the worst thing you could think of to hinder you are to stop you or to uh cause you to be destroyed or or uh anything that you could think of about what would be the worst sin that you can think of you know you can say well adultery and drinking killing and now just like a man the other day just berserking his mind and took five of his children out and killed him hauled him around in a car for two or three days you know finally throw them off in the woods well see You'd think well that's horrible and it is you know in any kind of kind of a thing that you could think of to be the most horrible but what would be the most the worst what would be the sin that we need to oh lay a shot now I can take it and go through the message and take hours over what the prophet has said on these things as to say in what they were and the little besetting sins and you know into different things and he even said I was noticing one he said there was Moses said the most besetting sin in his life was The Temper when he smoked the rock you know on the different things that happened said that was a besetting sin in his life all right now but we're going to get some things out of the way before we bring our thought to a conclusion as to what is the worst sin you know that could be all right now sin there's two sides or basically two issues of what we would talk about Sin all right uh we would talk about how that um one group would say I don't sin all right they got some truth then the other side of it would would say but I just can't help but sin yeah there's truth in the thoughts but now I like to find the middle of the road I like to know what the Bible is talking about uh when we lay out an order and speak of sin and uh you know and have it in the place that I can look at it and just someone say to me say well brother Dale said do you sin I'd say every day yeah but if you sin you're lost no I'm not see you're looking at it from a concept or a thought of what you've been taught or are holding you know to a point and uh you know looking at it and it was I guess in brother branham's day I was to me thinking probably the worst thing that confronted brother Branham I'm just saying for my thoughts okay I'd say the worst thing that confronted brother Branham was to try to explain about Sin you know because he could just go through the Bible and bring you a layout of serpent seed one God you know water baptism it would speak for itself but yet he would go out and he'd speak and he'd say you know talking about Sin and he'd say um my sins not drinking gambling and smoking running around with women he said that's not sin well not like the little old lady that was sitting there you know just took all she could he said one day and said run around them just what is sin yeah I mean if if it ain't a sin to smoke or gamble to run around with women or whatever murder or or he said she'd said what is sin see because she'd been taught all of her life that that's what sin was we've been taught all of our lives right sin is to do this sin is to do that it's a sin to do it here to Delight it's heat to steal and and we call it sin in a you know then you'd come along and brother Branham would make statements and and then we would question what he's saying but yet we would claim him to be the prophet right and uh it comes to my mind that you know like he said he said now it's not a sin to tell a lie oh but we been told all of our life it's a sin to tell a lie you know huh he say now an expression of it are trying to explain it he said a lie is more or less a part of trying to hurt somebody and said things could be said from an order that would not be hurting and said that wouldn't be called a lie but we've been taught a lie it's just anything contrary two right down the middle of the road you know what he said now like he said about that little boy that come up and said run around and said you was up in that mountains up there said we saw that light coming up and down he said no he said God I wanted to see what they'd say he lied you lie you lie well see what we've been taught is the point of hindrance all right oh do you believe brother Dallas a little white lie no I don't believe in White Lies black lives or any kind of do it but I do believe that there's things that we do and say that is not a sin that we talk about in our life but yet we look over at the other person and here I am with a problem when I look over to the other person that's a murderer stealing cheating lying and we say I'm not a sinner like that well it might be true you know but one of the emphasis the prophet placed upon what is sin all right and see if we get it down right and see what it is we'll see how everything ties together and we can get a beautiful picture of sin and what is going on or the problem and uh then maybe we can understand what would be the worst sin you know what would be the worst sin my brother Dale sin can't be forgiven blaspheming can't be forgiven Paul said causing them to blaspheme so you know if he's causing them to blast them he's doing a lot of blaspheming himself right but he said causing them to blaspheme but he said God forgave me paraphrasing it said because of my ignorance it's just putting a bunch together that he spoke up but what is sin to you see now Paul is writing as I said to the Hebrews and these are the Christians you're not writing to to the world the Bible's not written to the world you know it it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus all right now so then he said here that if we think about us being compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses whatever you want to call that whether you want to just make it the New Testament and a few little things it's still a great cloud I mean right if it's just say well it's not just the New Testament people it'd still be a great cloud of witnesses right millions of born-again Christians waiting on you and I when he said let's lay aside ever wait me the weight is something like pulling down pulling you know something and the sin which does so easily beset us talking to Christians all right now what is that worst sin now if the Bible is not written to The Sinner let's take him out of the picture right let's lead him out of the picture God has written to Christians those that are in Christ so then what we read in the Bible about those that are in Christ remember we see ourselves all right so now let's establish the point of what is sin and then we'll deal with the worst sin maybe surprising how simple it'll end but yet bear with me all right now I would say to one group of people or saying they hear and say you sin Tom would say no and they would take a great discourse of laying out the reason why that I'm under the blood I'm I'm sealed by the and God can't see that and all that would be well and good but you know I love simplicity how many of you in here don't raise your hand but just how many in here would agree that you need an advocate Jesus Christ the righteous is that according to John 1 right into me would you say you need an advocate now remember I do things deliberately okay so I just trapped you all right if you don't sin what do you need an advocate for okay are you with me you just agreed you needed an advocate well all right the reason you need an advocate is because of the sin now that should solve the problem of I shouldn't even have to express anything else you know that should solve the problem we admit we need an advocate and The Advocate is one who stands in place off because I've got problems all right now remember our Point through the Hebrew series we've been on Abraham lied give his wife away et cetera et cetera but you know God didn't see that he saw him stagger not at the promise of God to unbelief all right so then the things you and I do wrong that we would call Sin As Natural attributes uh I agree with you we stand and I'll give you the quotient of prophet perfectly totally sinless I don't know before almighty God all right but remember that's what God's looking at me we're looking at the rest of ourselves in being what we are so let's just think about it in that line now and we'll get down to where he's talking about Sin being unbelief but we could quote a lot of scriptures you know but it just got something I want you to deal with me on and think about it so go ahead and pull up number one which is first John uh 1 7 first two one is where he says that we have an advocate all right but look what John has to say to the church what if we walk in the light as he is in the light well fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin now we love this part right we love the walking and the light as he's in a but then can we Fellowship down with where it says it cleanses us from all sin all right we've been down Through the Ages they got in their denominational form they called it omniscient and commission if I mispronounce those words you know you put it in the right place one of them is I meant to do it and done it the other one said I didn't mean to do it and just got caught with it all right but we're not even dealing with that we're talking about straight truth all right now watch what John said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US all right if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US all right so now we've got to get an understanding in there somewhere about the situation of sin and you know and try to bring it to a place to where we can say this is what it is right here all right then we can understand now so we read what the prophet had to say we read the scripture Paul said I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord he says I Die daily First Corinthians 15 31. he said I Die daily now was Paul talking about that he sinned in which way was it you know I love some of the writings and I get to thinking I'm sorry um because I'm just that away I get to thinking about those people you know Paul wrote a lot about us as human beings but you know really Paul never experienced that Now you listen to what I'm saying there was no blood of Jesus Christ no condemnation Etc to the life of the Old Testament Saints will you agree yes you know there was not a cross that had died and shed the blood and made it to that way so then Paul in explaining it then about the troubles and he says we had them and you said Paul now you never experienced the condemnation of Jesus Christ in your heart you know until he came on over to Salvation but remember one thing he did face the condemnation of Christ remember the Old Testament was Christ huh now what I mean by that a human being has a moral obligation as a person you're born that way uh it doesn't matter what country you're born in you're born with a moral obligation to do good because that's the soul that's within you that's right and you're answering to a higher being from that Soul that's within you right it even says as much as we throw off on job I'm not a joke but uh set it to the gate lot all right we talk about a lot and how bad he was but the Bible says that it Vex his righteous soul the things that went on in Sodom so now to be United Way I don't believe uh that he was a partner to anybody are we with me without having to speak too much time you know the problem with homosexuality I don't think he was experienced in those situations he said if x is righteous soul see what it was is a moral obligation in her to do right all right that would be the Old Testament form but then when you would come into the New Testament with it you would be the Christ that shed his blood for you and I would be the condemnation to speaking to us now all right and see then that way Paul would would be able to explain it so my point is is if you ever read the Bible and think about well Paul never went through that condemnation of Christ he did because of the moral obligation in his soul to do good so he could speak from that just like Paul could speak just like that he had been raised up just like me and you right right which really he wasn't he was raised up under the dispensation of the Old Testament which had no blood of Jesus Christ no uh things like that but it was a moral obligation in the human soul to live right and do right but just put that in a little bit and won't charge you because it'll help in a minute but you'd say Paul do you sin he says I Die daily Paul did you need an advocate yeah Jesus Christ or righteous now think about it then let's look and see what the prophet had to say and get on to just a few wordings of it for continuing for the faith number two of you note look what he says we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin well I got this other quote over here well that's all right hold on I'll read it for you okay no problem there's none without sin every day we sin you sin Paul said he had to Die daily all right if we say we're seeing and have no sin then the Bible says we make God to lie and we could not do that so we sin daily in his grace God's grace it saves us all right look like leaning it right then we go over the other way and lean it to say it's impossible for us to sin because we have an advocate and we cannot sin now you dropped off on either side instead of trying to find a truth in the middle of the road all right look at the next one which is adoption 1960. and look what he's talking about but you have sins he's talking about a sinner don't sin right he's just a sinner he don't have any sins sinner sins don't Mount up in any sin so much and then finally God decides uh well he's on 942. the next one I'm going to take him out he doesn't build up things he's going to be judged as being a sinner a Christian doesn't want to have sins come on put your sins you that's Christians you notice here he's talking to the church keep her straight it's easy forgiveness of sins s-i-n-s we commit sins but the sinner is just a sinner God don't forgive him God don't forgive a sinner why because he's a sinner he's not asking for forgiveness he's a sinner but they're not amounted up in piles to decide whether he goes to hell for 842 but if he died at 841 no he's going to hell for an unbeliever right is that the way we get to the point then yes yes all right so let's see what a Christian really does look at number four on adoption why is it each day you make a mistake each day you do wrong but if you're born again man or woman as soon as you make the mistake God knows you're sorry for it you couldn't stand in the presence of President Roosevelt or anybody else and say I'm wrong God forgive me for this thing why and ours were the blood atone notice that's s-i-n-s a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sins does wrong and gets a wrong thought wrong impression make Scruples wobbles like a little child walking trying to learn how to walk he just don't know how to walk yet right go on to the next we'll get these out of the way and then I'll get back to my point number five which is Hebrews chapter 6. paragraph 262. perfected absolutely spotless and blindness not one sin on us okay remember the one with leaning us away we all sin every day now you think it's leaning I'm just illustrating God is not doing it now we're going to lean the other way I used to get so tickled at brother Mook talking about the uh the way sanctification came into being he said that they had got so far off on the side so he said it's like throwing them like he told Wesley a rubber band and you know how they'll stretch and then finally he just throw a rubber band over to Wesley and said you got a way off over here on this side you know because you had to start talking about doing and not doing and not doing and pulling back to the truth you know and line him up that was his way of illustrating which was a good point you know because Luke Wesley did come as a legalist and things but look what he says about now absolutely spotless blameless not one sin on us are we above temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God could no more judge us than nothing couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you and he can't judge me again because he took my judgment if I've been redeemed trying to lean one way trying to lean the other way it's explaining it do we sin yes we are human Mortals and we do wrong all right but in God's eyes he don't see that right so in your eyes I'm a sinner you know I've seen you do so and so I've seen you do that but see God don't see that one because I've got an advocate one who pays my prize does it make it okay that I can just go out and just live like the devil no because remember you're going to give an account of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad if we don't repent somewhere down the road things are going to be brought up not as a decision of whether to go to heaven or not if you're born again you're going but then just remember what we read during one of the quote if you're born again Christian could have ran them in another time talking about it he said when you do wrong he said you immediately he said before you even cry out I'm paraphrasing it but I can find it he said before you even cry out he said God's already forgiven you because he knows what you're going to do he knows you're going to say forgive me all right so you really didn't do it you were you were trapped into it now that's the sin we talk about that's the things of life we talk about that we call sin all right now if I made an illustration enough for you to understand yes yes it's not that we just go out and live like the devil and say we're covered by the blood of he no you prove you're lost but when you're concerned with your life and saying Lord forgive me then we're falling into category of Paul who says I Die daily Amen brother random saying I see him every day I said I don't want to do that he said and I cry out and God forgives all right but you know what that is little things of life that's what we've been taught all of our life is sin I mean how many would admit since I got started you had a wrong thought someone said what in the world is he talking about someone's saying oh we see shut up I understand I'm sleepy and you're gonna wake me up if he talks too loud to admit that we do have problems here's what the prophet said he said you got troubles with a spot he said Satan has got a ripe to hammer you he said which would be better laying on a bed of Affliction or out over here in I forgot the illustration values my own over in Honky Tonk doing a bunch of wrong he said Satan's got a point at you and he says you've got to keep that place covered right so you got troubles with one thing and I don't have to tell you what it is right right you know what your biggest problem is right you just won't admit it well when you want to admit it God can help you well really God loves me so much that he don't care what I do now you're getting into stupidity let alone anything out huh but now think about it we do little things each day in our lives we have wrong thoughts we have different things you know the Bible does say that be angry and sin not when I thought angry was sin now the scripture is defining between two things and it says be angry and sin not they turned around read from Brother random war that Jesus drove him out of the temple and said Jesus got angry now you're going to say that he sinned no because he was fulfilling the scripture he was a deacon he was driving out the money changers he was taking care of his job right all right see then we better get away from a Little Talks Of Life you know we have an advocate now I wanted to find something right here real careful for you to think of an advocate is one who covers for the things you do okay we do wrong we have an advocate to cover that we repent it takes care of it we'll have no more problems all right but those are little things of life brother random told a brother that won't call his name because I'm trying to get away from that but he said you were born like under a two in your your new birth put you under a four he said you'll fight your nature all of your life well I agree with that 100 percent because you're going to fight your nature that's right right you're going to fight it you're going to have problems with your nature and somebody does something wrong to you you're going to raise up right but the difference in the two is what when you raise up immediately The Advocate says wait a minute it's not right for a Christian so then you put it back down but if you just let it run off the Bible says Don't let the sun go down on your Wrath that's still in the same scriptures right in there where he's talking about be angry and sin not don't let the sun go down on your right what's he talking about you're talking about the same thing I've always tried to explain to you right see Wade does something to me or I do something to him you know and then you know in a little while if I don't get that straight you know what will happen I'll start thinking it was his fault anyway he caused it and you know for the day's over he owes me an apology I don't owe him one I get brought out what was in him really good ain't it okay but is that true so don't let the sun go down on your Wrath be angry and sin not there's a possibility of having anger get them back up oh but I don't have no anger what do you need temperaments in the Statue of a perfect man after you're born again okay all right are you following me but the little things of life anger malice descent to hatreds or something little parts that still dang alone to us you know the one that has amazed me how did a man could take a scripture and he could explain that you are totally born again and then he'd turn around and he'd say there's doors indoors he said you open the door you haven't listened to those messages if I was you I'd put it down and go home I'd listen to him doors and doors he said we got this little door over here yeah he's talking about a born-again Christian that he's already entered the heart as a new bird but he said we got this little door of pride he said you're not getting in there we'll see that's the things we got to open the door that he can clean out right but I'm trying to make a point and I know it's slow forgive me because this point is vital to the next stage it will drop the things we do in life of wrong things you know we got a little temper we got a little problem we got a little dish we got a little of that you know and we do a little something and somebody'll say well you're not done now well you do it too I've seen you do more than I done well now that's bringing out another one of them doors that needs to be worked on because what does it matter what the other person does you know we're supposed to be concerned about ourselves right there's no perfection in me getting you lined up right it's in getting this old boy all right so now we're developing that there are things of life that are covered by the blood of Jesus Christ but we still need to repent and get rid of it we need to cover those things come down through the statue of a perfect man and the different things to get rid of those things we need to do that but now all right everybody with me now let's turn around all right I get tickled it I can't never remember names but brother Louise's wife Christine okay she's been riding on the the things I preached on the field of life and today about it if you wanted to know something about the seals just go ask sister Francine because she spent I don't know how many years transcribing to take that off from tape and put it down to where it's going to be putting a book for him Brother Martin him's paying for it here you know for her to do that and she probably knows a lot about me then and she knows when I come up to say something her mind's clicking that's on page 43. Brother Gary used to say brother Dale when you say something I know what page you're on you know because he listens so much okay now we're going to click get away from that that's little things that are dealt with in life that we need to repent right now everybody followed me we need to repent we need to work on them things because that's natural things of life but that's not what sin is right that's why your Prophet kept trying to Define that he kept trying to Define to us that sin wasn't drinking gambling and smoking running around with women what did he say sin was okay let's read a few and hold it points go to number six which is Ministry explained 1950. what is sin what is sin he said not drinking or smoking or gambling or rejecting Church sin is unbelief is that right he that believeth not is condemned already it's a sinner so you're not you you do you're not destroyed or separated from God because you're a sinner everyday life this that or the other it doesn't separate you because you have an advocate you repent you're lined back up that doesn't separate it you're not destroyed or separated from God because you're a sinner you're separated from God from God because you refuse to walk with him the walk in his provided way now what is his provided way look at Elijah in a meal offering recent 1960. paragraph 136. he would have slew cyber right then for doubting what I want you to do sometimes just take a thought in your mind and listen to the message I'm talking about the brother runs into our message does he talk about Sarah with a temper come on did he talk about Sarah and how she run around with a neighbor or wanted to run around with a neighbor oh she would have done that well that's wonderful but he doesn't spread around doesn't speak of her Natural Life you know he did speak of Moses and he said Moses married who was it zipporah he said she is a hot-headed woman and said they had a lot of problems out on the backside of the desert right well now I'm sure you think that when Abraham gave Sarah away to Sarah they said okay honey I do what you tell me to do I don't think so now I believe she was human she'd say Abraham what are you doing and he said look they're going to kill me you you get the point I'm trying to show you this over here is not sin the little things that's when in life that happens to us is not sin it's sin when you unbelief or doubt now is his point right he would have flew right sorry right then not for arguing with Abraham about what he's doing he doesn't even mention Sarah arguing with him about trying to get the child through Hagar read it what's he talking about he would have sluice over right then for doubting because that's the worst sin there is is unbelief and the only sin and she doubted in life within herself when the angel discerned her through the den trolled and what is it the worst sin there is is unbelief the only one they get all these in your thoughts where we'll get to the point look at the next one invisible Union number eight what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what everyone said eve never doubted God being real do I need to bring those quotes Eve never doubted God but she didn't believe him that's where she messed up on Hebrews 13 8 right she didn't believe him to be who he was and what would take place so it wasn't beaten on him for a cause or something in their lives why does preachers want to work on your flesh all the time instead of getting down where you live at amen is it because that's all they know come on unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word now you've got a problem if you don't follow me because you've got to get Temperance and patience and things in here and then that means you got a little problems you know with things and then you're going to say that a Christian has little problems and you better agree that he does but we better get rid of unbelief unbelief is the one thing we better get rid of all right look at number nine which is the events made clear by prophecy foretelling the future events this Believers is commanded by its author to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one word to disbelieve it you might as well quit trying until you believe that word are you read you might as well quit trying until you believe that word well I just won't cry anymore because he said it might as well not try now don't be stupid he simply means back up and start over again and try to work right well brother Dale I'll have you to know I haven't had a wrong thought all week we'll praise God pray for me I just had one I'm trying to get a point to you look you might as well quit trying until you believe that word every word is absolutely a part of almighty God God made manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is we are commanded as Believers to believe every word of God so now what is unbelief what does it mean to left side all of that unbelief and the True Believers in this word roll it up and the True Believers in this word who accept it that way believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises every one of them to be manifested in his age every believer has watched for it every believer that's been on the on the toes watching is the one that's been revealed it's been re that's been revealed to now what has been my point for quite a while is it revealed to you the age the hour that we're living the time what about it look what he says then on what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith that's the next one number 10. and when you see that it ought to attract the attention of every man and woman to lay aside ever little skeptic talk every little skeptic talk oh I love that last I'd ever wait and the little unbelief that does so easily beset us some little something come up and we say well I never heard that before search it out in the scriptures if it's the Bible stay with it now if you've never heard this message you never heard the truth of water baptism no eternal hell etc etc you know you're not an unbeliever because you never heard truth right but when you hear truth and don't believe it some little simple something well I never heard it that way brother damn I never heard it explain the way you is explaining it this morning that we're compassioned about was so great a cloud of witnesses that everybody behind us is dependent on us and everybody after us is dependent on us I never heard it like that but now you have what are you gonna do with it right now it can be determined whether you're an unbeliever or not you see what I mean and the way the preachers are and the way they do things and people don't know they say I I don't know whether that's true or not we'll study it out in the Bible I'm not going to do that I'm going to go back and ask the brother that told me that brother Dale was wrong we are only going to get more about what I'm wrong about why don't you go to the Bible and start it out all right we'll bypass the next one no wait a minute let's go with this from Hebrews chapter 6. we will bypass the next one which is taken from God's way that's been made before us and I quote was quoting this morning where brother Brown and said I'm not packing up to go to heaven he said I'm unpacking to go to heaven there's a rapture Cut Loose everything the Bible said let us lay aside every weight and send that does so easily beside us that we might run this race with patience getting rare things for a rapture you just get the statue of perfect man it'll take care of the rest of it but look at this when this is you know he doesn't throw that up there Hebrews chapter six let's get that bro back up one it says God I said give people Faith now you see and may the little habits and things that's hangering hanging unto the people you ought to back up to number 10 12. back up number 12. we got it okay give people faith and may the little habits and things that's hanging on two people may they Shake loose from them this morning with this word of God which is an anchor of the Soul steadfast and sure is he talking about the little things hanging on us of little problems in life or is he talking about the little unbelief when the things are problems of Life a thing is covered by The Advocate you don't have much trouble but the unbelief yeah okay think what you want to some of you are sitting there brother Dale he's trying to make himself something we got to believe everything he says now you are in on the leaf because I have never said that so you're in unbelief not me I'm just trying to help you you see you're making yourself an unbeliever no I'm not an unbeliever in God I'm an unbeliever in you well that's all right but if I tell you what he says and you don't believe it what's the difference a dumb donkey telling you the truth and you don't believe it you're an unbeliever you see where we're missing it you see what I'm trying to bring down a point to what is the worst sin that church right over here across the road they don't believe in it in one true and living God they don't believe the truth this message but you know what if they've never heard it they're not responsible right well we've heard it so we're responsible right look at this one on melchizer did the great Prince number 14. separate yourself from everything I'll have to say this look I hope it finds its resting place because I never thought it premeditation in other words you never thought it up he said I hope you listen maybe that's the reason some of us are not getting along so well we're holding on to things that we ought to let go separation a little doubt a little Wonder a little skeptic I wonder if it's right could this be could that be how could it be cut loose this morning Hebrews 12 1. what is that unbelief he says okay let's take this last one then I'll get my point inspiration preached in 1956. paragraph are e62. how the Miracles was done by Faith said let us let us out ever wait and to sin that so easily beset us see he's right up there where he's talking about it right race with patients set before us Hebrews 12 sin we're compassionate about with such a great crowd of witnesses how the Miracles was done by faith all the way down before us stands dark to guard us and help us to look at what happened to the ages what happened in the Old Testament about Christ let us lay aside every weight and the sin that says so easily beset us we've stopped too much for little social things we stop too much intolerant with the world we've stopped too much to see if we don't get a little bit too fanatically I'm a scared of I'm more afraid listen I want you to read that statement I am a scared of I'm more afraid of the person that's afraid everybody reading it yes yes when I read that the first time I passed over it and missed it and I looked back at it and I said Lord that's the statement I want for the whole message more afraid of the person that's afraid that I am the person that is a fanatic now that's a statement isn't it remember when he said I'd rather have a little wildfire and no fire at all okay we're down to 3 30. give me a few minutes what is the worst sin we've established that sin is not the little things doing wrong and it's not even drinking gambling and smoking running around with women Etc that if you do those things you're just a sinner right but in our lives we have little problems and things that we have to deal with every day and we have an advocate and as quick as we do that we repent to get rid of it and ask God to help us yeah but we found out sin is unbelief sin is to be as we read well I never thought of it like that what he said but I never thought of it like that so by me never thinking of it like that I don't agree with you because it would have come to anybody would have come to me you're in unbelief right what is the worst sin now of all and I'm going to make it personal all right go ahead and we'll make it very personal for 40 something years I have tried to get you to see this message of what I believed it was that it was to bring forth Christ in the last days and that Christ Among Us would change these mortal bodies and take us into Rapture that's all I've done 1969 in Athens Georgia I preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the word made flesh how much do you think I believe that today I have preached to you from my heart for all of these years fault of battles and the Skeptics here and the doubters and the the people trying to destroy it yet still loving and wanting to move on because I know that if you don't see what I'm talking about I can't make you see it know that if God revealed it to me I can try to help you to see it but I can't give it to you it's between you and God so I want to know whether I've missed a message out now don't come with me that I call Mary Martin Martha Mary don't be please don't be dumb I want to know where I've missed the message anymore from the seals to the marriage and divorce the Daniel 70 weeks to the predestination I want to know where I missed the message because if I missed it there's where my sin lies I need to get that in line because sin is to disbelieve the message now follow me we're not concerned with disbelieving or we shouldn't be worried about disbelieving Luther's message we know we don't believe what he taught was wrong but we do believe what he taught right as to be right all right so the main thing is over in you here so what is the greatest sin brother Dale that you could think of I spent 29 messages 28. speaking on positive attitude I believe we all need a positive attitude I believe we need to get away from negativism of doubts and frustrations of whether or not we're believing the truth thing as the Bible called it wandering Stars wondering if this one's right or if that one's right or if this is right or that's right and get settled down into a point of saying the message is right all right what has been my point 28 messages driving at this message 29 really counting this morning I guess 28. for you to disbelieve the truth that I've brought about what we're supposed to be in the end time we are supposed to be the bride of Christ we are supposed to be an invincible Army we're supposed to be a people who walks in the light of the love of God in the word we're supposed to be them that are word born bride the son of man that even God is not complete without us the prophet would reign and for you to disbelieve that as being you and that's sin what do you mean brother Dale I mean for you to say I just can't believe it that away well I want to know where the truth is so come and tell me and your duty bound to tell me not tell nobody else if you tell anybody else you're a lying hypocrite gonna make it any worse you're a stupid idiot you're a dumb nut can I call you anything else I've always said if you got something with me come to me and let's talk it over but no it's outside you will answer for that right because I have given even the pulpit to be opened for you to come and show me where I'm wrong see I'm not saying you got to believe what brother Dale believes I believe I have put forth in this study the things of the great faith that God expects you and I to have to be able to walk off this Earth and to have one little bit of unbelief in there or to doubt it being us is sin you say well I I I I just can't believe that it's for me then you're a sinner because you're saying God's not able to make it for you I know that ain't gonna go over because you're I'll stay with it sin is unbelief I preach things that most of the Ministers of this message have never and will never even try to preach about that doesn't exalt me I give all the honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ because he's the only one that can keep me straight and I walk out here sometimes with notes and I'm lined up a certain way and I something happens and he comes down and those notes are totally totally destroyed because he showed me what truth is it's not whether you believe me or not brother Branham said we I've read the quote need to read it again we've been Invincible Army Satan would be powerless before us he said it do you believe that can ever take place do you I'm asking do you believe that can ever well I wouldn't want to said it I just keep holding it up I keep saying we're responsible we're responsible to believe how the word of God he said what is unbelief unbelief in God who is the word but I just don't see how it can be us you're an unbelief can I put it any planner you're an unbelief if you don't believe you can be a part of it then you're an unbelief I believe brother so and so can I believe sister so and so brother random didn't say that brother Brown said if there's one going out of the state you've got to say and believe that you are that one but I don't understand all of these great Mysteries nobody has said anything about it see that's what you think it is you think it's understanding all of these things it is not it is that Revelation coming in within us that is pushing out of Christ to live in our hearts and our lives baby well the Bible's not a book of rules it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and then Paul said I Die daily that was him writing about Christ in him the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God he was saying what God was inside of him what you say one brother but you just don't preach against women hiring dresses that's what we don't like about you well why don't you dress right why don't you quit cutting your hair and I don't have to preach it right man come here one time he preached the messages preached freed my sheep he went on for an hour and a half and I knew he was saying something but I couldn't figure it out about three years later or four he said you remember that life message I preached at your church but yeah it was like feed my sheep that's what I was trying to tell you that you're so deep since my family was going to your church I said you ought to drop back and feed my family instead of all them deep things you think I'm a dirty dog I turned and walked away from that person because within my heart I was thinking why didn't you teach your children the right things to do in life and I wouldn't have had to worry about them here and I could preach what God gave me you see you think we need to preach simple things what's more simple than faith what's more simple than believe in God what's more more simple than getting you to realize who you are you show me the Simplicity oh no you preaching his iron Dress You Preach against 100. I ask you I've made this statement and I'll make it one more time you show me a church where there's a legalistic preacher of those tiles and I'll put the women in this church against them as being dressed better and doing better I've never seen a church yet and you ain't either if you'll think that they had a legalistic preacher that the women ever lined up thank God sit in a man's house one time legalistic preacher he said brother Dale said what is it that that the women could wire where we could go in mixed bathing I have to admit I had problems because he was legalistic to the Core I said brother I said brother Branham said mixed bathing was wrong oh he did and he used to scream and holler about the can't dress these women wearing these tent dresses every service and one day I'm stupid I don't understand all that stuff what clothes are you know and I asked my wife I said what is a tent dress he said well they kind of pull up here and I know I'll be wrong with it but kind of flared out it's kind of pulled up here and and fastens around and it's called a tent style dress they can explain the rest of you I said honey would you show me one of them she said them sisters right over there all the sisters was right over there was the sisters that come from his church what did they do with his dress isn't home and they said we wear Gauchos to ride horses not much difference between gotchos and pants but of course I'm not that spiritual you know you see Church I'm dealing Within Myself of one thing I won't ever dab of unbelief with this message this Bible and things that I could look at in there and say I don't know whether that can be or not I want that took out I want that took out of my heart and my life they were when the prophet says the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily I can holler amen make me Lord what you want me to be show me where I'm wrong unbelief in God's word that is God let's Stand Together come on musician think on these things what is unbelief well brother Dale I admit I don't even know what you're talking about the tapes are made you can go home listen to them again if you don't I'll be sitting in an office or somewhere around give me a chance to do it I've always said I told him about it in a Bible study I mentioned it the other day when I go outside I try my best to shake ends with everybody here I think that's a good pastor I don't stop with the first person and let them Captivate my conversation and my hours I go and I talk to everybody then if you want to talk to me I'll be glad to talk to you but give me an opportunity to go shake hands with everybody how many of you shook hands with the visitors this morning got a few hands a lot of you didn't shake hands with the visitors did you well why do you feel if you went to their Church and they didn't shake your hand you would come back saying they didn't shake my hand remember to have friends you must be friendly right make people welcome yeah I don't want to welcome because they're not a part of us well good why don't you leave because you ain't a part of us can I get any more blood but you see I always get into trouble because everybody tries to interpret what I'm saying instead of saying what I say you say what I say I ain't got a bit of trouble you coming back with me and talking to me about it but when you say what you think that I supposed to think I don't think that way don't ask me if you don't want the truth because if you ask me I'll tell you where I stand but it'll be in the Love From the Bottom of My Heart and with a realization that you're looking in the face of a sinner I said it right you're looking in the face of a sinner I don't know any word that I disbelieve right around this message you understand how I could spend hours on do you believe any do you disbelieve any part of the message no I'm just asking you something do you disbelieve any part of it no we say no I believe if it's never been brought out in the open you don't know what you're believing see you could have come from a two soul group of people to say I believe everything brother Brown says right take on these things go ahead brother 403 in the spiral book I've Been Changed amen moral three anybody have a need believe this message what about it I was lost in the darkness but now I'm found I was blind but now I see I've been changed I've been reborn all my life has been real you heard our brother he's standing here in a place with his mother Lord because we thank you and we love you father in Jesus name I've been changed I've been reborn all my life he said the hardest thing was to get them Pharisees to realize they were sinners so that he could die for them now how are you going to make people that are word word word word word related all their life born and raised in the word the entirely stood in front of God as an unbeliever you know why because he didn't believe that was God you can't believe nothing else
