[6:08] I've reached it all I reached the place
[6:11] that that this is this is all that you

[6:16] that there's every day there's something
[6:17] new there's something greater than what

[6:27] greatest day of my life amen because I I
[6:30] look back at what I what I've come
[6:32] through and I've had some great things
[6:34] and the Lord has sh me things but I
[6:36] wouldn't take my experience today for
[6:38] any any experience that I've had in my
[6:40] life today I I I think today is is the
[6:44] greatest day of my life what God has
[6:46] shown
[6:47] me and it doesn't matter and we one of
[6:51] the things we'll talk about tonight but
[6:52] you it doesn't matter about the trials
[6:53] and tribulations all these things hey

[6:57] part of life right but it's what God has
[6:59] given us what God has shown us it's it's
[7:02] so I just you know such an amazing thing
[7:06] I thank God for that if you have your

[8:35] what we have need of we just commit them
[8:37] all in in your hands in the name of
[8:41] Jesus Christ
[8:42] amen amen second Corinthians chapter
[8:46] 1 verse 17 says when I therefore was
[8:50] thus minded that I use likeness or the
[8:52] things that I purpose do a purpose
[8:54] according to the flesh that with me
[8:56] there should be yay yay and nay nay But
[9:00] as God is true our word toward you was
[9:02] not yay and nay for the spirit of God
[9:05] Jesus Christ for the Son of God Jesus
[9:07] Christ who was preached among you by us
[9:10] even by me sylvanus and Timothy was not
[9:13] yay and nay but in him was yay for all
[9:15] the promises of God in him are yay and
[9:17] in him amen and to the glory of God by
[9:20] us for he which establishe US with you
[9:24] in Christ and hath anointed us is C is
[9:27] God and who have also sealed us and
[9:31] given us the earnest of the spirit in
[9:34] our hearts moreover I call God for a
[9:36] record upon my soul that to spare you I
[9:40] came not as yet unto Corinth not for
[9:43] that we have dominion over your faith
[9:45] but are helpers of your joy for by faith
[9:49] you stand amen Lord bless the reading of
[9:52] the word have your seats this
[9:54] evening and uh just want
[9:57] to uh
[10:00] say this evening
[10:03] uh I know we're just not just the people
[10:07] here in the in the church but you know
[10:09] we see the the ones on the internet and
[10:12] just want to say we greet you and we
[10:16] certainly pray for the ones that are are
[10:18] not here and listening in been thinking
[10:20] of Mike and Mary so if they're listening
[10:22] we say hold to them I told Mary before
[10:25] she left I said have you ever been in
[10:26] Sub-Zero temperatures and she said no
[10:29] and I said well you're getting ready to
[10:31] be and she sent me a little me I sent
[10:34] her a message the other day and she sent
[10:36] me one back saying that they had sleep
[10:38] up there and uh supposed to be getting
[10:41] snow and getting in the single digit so
[10:44] she's getting ready to have some
[10:45] fun but uh just just we just you know
[10:49] they're part of us and they're not here
[10:51] we just keep them on our heart amen but
[10:55] um anyway this evening I want to speak
[10:56] on thought on Promises of God just
[10:58] simple thought and brother Bram says in
[11:00] the message what is what is in thine
[11:04] hand he said when God promises anything
[11:06] God's under obligation to take care of
[11:08] his promises God always will back it up
[11:11] I don't care what God what anybody says
[11:13] about it when God says it's so it's so
[11:16] rest your soul body and strength upon it
[11:18] because God's obligated to his word
[11:22] amen and so uh couple of couple things
[11:27] uh definition of of a promises a uh
[11:31] couple of them a declaration that
[11:32] something will or will not be done given
[11:35] Etc by one so you make a declaration an
[11:39] expressed Assurance on on which
[11:42] expectation is to be
[11:45] based and well that one stood up to me
[11:48] because uh what brother Brandon was
[11:51] saying because God can make promises but
[11:53] if you don't accept them they're not a
[11:55] promise that's right they don't you any
[11:56] good and that's why he says an Express
[11:58] to Assurance on which expectation is
[12:00] based because that's what faith is a
[12:03] hope is an expectation so if you don't
[12:06] have an expectation of it then it
[12:07] doesn't do you any good right right and
[12:10] it says something that has the the
[12:12] effect of an expressed
[12:15] assurance and because like brother
[12:18] Brenham told us he said you can't find
[12:21] William brandham or Orman Neville in the
[12:23] Bible but he said what was going on
[12:26] during the time of their life that put
[12:27] his name in the book right so it's not
[12:30] that we you know because Aaron is in the
[12:32] Bible right but I would want to live the
[12:35] life that Aaron lived
[12:38] oh but I see myself in the word amen and
[12:41] so that gives me the because that's the
[12:44] effect of an expressed
[12:45] Assurance because that gives me the
[12:47] Assurance of what the scripture is
[12:49] because I find myself there and we we
[12:51] know brother R said that there was
[12:54] there's nothing negative in God right
[12:57] amen there's no God doesn't go uh I was
[13:01] reading something the other day and they
[13:02] were talking about how God created
[13:05] evil you know that's that's pretty bad
[13:08] because of somebody that has supposedly
[13:10] has studied this message and has studied
[13:12] this message and and somebody that
[13:14] actually had claimed to believe this
[13:16] that brother BR was a prophet and
[13:17] understood these things and then turn
[13:19] around and talk about God creating
[13:22] something I said it doesn't you know it
[13:24] doesn't take a genius to understand that
[13:25] the scripture tells us that uh there in
[13:29] uh I believe it was Ezekiel where he
[13:30] talks about he said that Satan was
[13:32] created perfect right so he he was God
[13:35] didn't create anything imperfect but he
[13:38] knew what would take place and he put
[13:39] man on free moral agency because he knew
[13:41] what would take place God didn't force
[13:43] us into anything we done it
[13:45] ourselves that's right see we weren we
[13:47] weren't forced into anything right
[13:51] amen so the scripture says here tells us
[13:54] that in him in God there there's a it's
[13:59] yay and amen right there's nothing nay
[14:02] about
[14:04] it and see he's he's speaking
[14:08] here and I I believe last time we spoke
[14:11] we speaking on on the book of
[14:13] Corinthians last time and you know what
[14:15] I understand Paul had his hands full
[14:16] with the book with the church at Corinth
[14:19] of of all the churches that he had to
[14:21] deal with this was the one he had to
[14:22] straighten out the most this is a group
[14:24] that always had the had the most
[14:26] problems because they didn't understand
[14:28] anything because they were not rooted
[14:30] and grounded so he had to spend all kind
[14:31] of time fixing the simple things that we
[14:34] think are simple things but because they
[14:37] didn't understand he couldn't Express
[14:39] things to them that he could express to
[14:41] the Ephesians or the Galatians because
[14:43] he had to keep going back and just
[14:45] taking care of the simple things to them
[14:48] you I thank God that he had to go back
[14:50] and do that because it was word to me
[14:53] because it spoke to me because see you
[14:56] know just wasn't just for their day but
[14:58] came a day that it came was going to
[15:00] come to us right and I've been listening
[15:03] to the the been reading in the in the
[15:05] church age book and you go back and you
[15:08] you know you start reading these things
[15:09] and you start looking back all through
[15:10] the the church ages and the different
[15:12] things that was going to take place and
[15:15] you know how how the things that crept
[15:17] in during the different Church ages we
[15:20] see the same thing today because it's
[15:21] the same Spirit right it's the same
[15:24] Spirit that's going on today we're still
[15:26] fighting the same battle they did that's
[15:28] right that's reason you can go back and
[15:29] see yourself in in each one of the
[15:30] church ages and see those things that
[15:32] that are brought out it speaks to each
[15:35] one of
[15:38] us he
[15:40] says and here it says but he said but he
[15:44] that which establishe US with you in
[15:48] Christ and hath anointed us is God
[15:52] because he gave us these promises but he
[15:55] has established us because that's what
[15:57] he's trying to do is establish
[15:59] and then he then he said he's anointed
[16:00] us and he has sealed us and given us the
[16:03] earnest of the
[16:12] spirit so we can receive these
[16:25] promises
[16:27] s
[16:29] and he says in verse 24 not not for that
[16:33] we should have dominion over your faith
[16:35] but are helpers of your joy for by faith
[16:37] ye
[16:39] stand right so he understands it that
[16:42] you know because he said he didn't come
[16:43] to Corinth because he didn't want to
[16:45] have a it wasn't a dominion over them
[16:47] but it was establishing them that they
[16:48] stand on their own faith and he said you
[16:50] we're just to help you in your joy or
[16:53] your
[16:56] upbringing brother says in second-handed
[16:59] robe he
[17:01] says he said I heard the pastor say this
[17:04] morning he said many are becoming
[17:06] discouraged he said what we need brother
[17:08] is courage what we need is to be
[17:10] encouraged and it's right trials may
[17:13] come we never was promised to be immune
[17:16] from them but he will give Grace to go
[17:18] through them if the Mountain's too high
[17:21] to go over too deep to go under it too
[17:23] wide to go around it he will give Grace
[17:26] to go through it that's right just don't
[17:28] worry but keep your eyes on Christ for
[17:31] he's the only one that can take us
[17:36] through so we don't have to worry
[17:38] because he's going to make a way for us
[17:41] so he's he's got it all in his hands the
[17:43] message now this is from the message
[17:47] influence brother R says all Promises of
[17:50] God are true but they're on conditions
[17:52] no matter how fundamentally right we are
[17:55] we've got to approach it the right way
[17:57] now men can be fundamentally right and
[18:00] still not receive the blessings of God
[18:02] because it's approached in the wrong way
[18:04] it goes upon conditions right you know
[18:07] you go back and you look at um David
[18:11] when what brother was speaking of trying
[18:12] to do God a service you know David David
[18:15] had the right motive and the right
[18:17] objective but he approached it wrong and
[18:19] see you know he was trying to bless the
[18:21] people but in the midst of trying to
[18:23] bless him he killed somebody he
[18:26] committed it was death unto him right
[18:28] because it was approached the wrong way
[18:30] so the blessings of God because you can
[18:32] rece have the blessings of God you can
[18:34] have the promises of God but there's a
[18:36] proper way to approach God right God let
[18:39] because see if you want to know how to
[18:41] approach God God will show you how to
[18:43] how to approach him that's right
[18:46] so because uh one of the things that
[18:49] that I've covered the different places
[18:51] that I've preached one of the one of the
[18:53] main po topics that I've covered just
[18:55] seems like God has laid something on my
[18:57] heart everywh where I've went and and
[18:59] I've always cover been covering the new
[19:01] birth and I just something I can't get
[19:03] away from right and you know because
[19:06] it's so important to understand because
[19:09] a lot of people
[19:10] have just expressed something about you
[19:13] know you need to be born again but they
[19:15] don't really expound the time to express
[19:18] it to people to understand how how to
[19:20] become born again because it's not just
[19:22] something that just falls on you right
[19:25] because you know one of the problems
[19:26] that that I've seen is people
[19:28] the new birth because just being born
[19:30] again so easy and so simple it's just
[19:32] like falling off the log and other
[19:35] people make it so hard that you couldn't
[19:37] you couldn't obtain to it in a million
[19:40] years right and how are you supposed to
[19:42] have faith to reach a place because you
[19:45] know what he said If any man had come
[19:47] upon the same uh basis and hadn't
[19:50] reached the same place and accepted God
[19:53] that he had to give him the had to give
[19:55] him the Holy Ghost right he man came the
[19:58] same way and he done it one one time for
[20:00] somebody he would have to do it again
[20:03] right because he's
[20:05] obligated he's obligated to fulfill his
[20:07] word amen and so it's it's something
[20:09] it's you know because it's not so hard
[20:11] it's not so difficult but you know the
[20:13] thing is it's in the in the age that we
[20:16] live in because it's become so LAX
[20:18] because so simple right because people
[20:21] don't have a desire oh my brother BR
[20:24] said that he he had more desire to give
[20:26] it to you than you wanted it for
[20:28] yourself but you know what people people
[20:30] have lost the desire to seek for God
[20:33] right people people people don't have
[20:35] any don't have don't even know what it's
[20:36] like oh
[20:38] my and so it becomes it becomes very
[20:44] hard but he said it was you know he said
[20:46] it was based on conditions you have to
[20:48] meet the same
[20:50] conditions and it doesn't matter if you
[20:53] have if you have to take 10 years or a
[20:55] 100 if you if you hold to God and you
[20:59] because he said he said if you repent
[21:02] and I think that's one of the problems
[21:03] where people fail is people don't know
[21:05] what repent means amen they don't mean
[21:07] for because they don't understand get
[21:09] away from turn away from the things that
[21:10] you've done before and get before God
[21:13] and wait on God to to clean these things
[21:15] out from you say Lord I want to be
[21:17] covered by the blood I want I want these
[21:19] things under the
[21:21] blood because sometimes people just go
[21:23] to the altar because they just feel
[21:25] something but they really don't want to
[21:26] get away from it they just don't want
[21:29] they don't want to turn away from
[21:30] it but he said when if you repent and he
[21:33] said you're baptized brother B said he's
[21:36] obligated to give you the Holy Ghost
[21:39] that's right what it
[21:42] say but sometimes they don't think
[21:44] people take him at his word brother said
[21:46] that's what God was looking for was
[21:47] somebody take him at his word
[21:51] right now I read this before and I want
[21:55] to read it again and I read this
[21:58] it's one of my favorite quotes and I
[21:59] read it just about every church that I
[22:01] go to first time and I tell him I said
[22:05] you want to know why I believe it's what
[22:06] I believe and this is from a message why
[22:09] 1963 heart Springs
[22:11] Arkansas and brother Ram says I just
[22:14] came from India here not long ago and I
[22:15] heard of a woman over here she was
[22:17] poverty stricken her son had went to
[22:20] India to be a doctor he got over there
[22:22] and got away from his medical practice
[22:23] and got into another I believe he was
[22:25] electrical engineer or something and
[22:27] this woman woman got poverty stricken
[22:30] and she didn't have nothing so charity
[22:31] was trying to come and take care of her
[22:34] and so they invested the case and when
[22:35] they investigated they found out that
[22:37] the woman had one support and that was a
[22:39] son that was a very wealthy man in India
[22:42] and said well why don't your son support
[22:44] you so I just couldn't ask him said I'm
[22:47] his mother said and I just rather take
[22:50] charity than to ask my son said don't
[22:52] you ever hear from him so do I hear from
[22:55] him at least once or twice a month said
[22:57] hey he writes some of the most sweetest
[22:59] letters you've ever read so it look like
[23:01] if he loved his mother enough and he had
[23:03] plenty of money he'd be trying to take
[23:05] care of her instead of her going to
[23:07] charity said well perhaps if he knew I
[23:10] was this way he said he would he would
[23:12] take care of me but you know he doesn't
[23:15] know and I just feel embarrassed to tell
[23:16] my son like that he said and he writes
[23:19] you sweet letters oh some of the
[23:21] sweetest letters and said he sends me
[23:23] some the prettiest pictures you ever
[23:25] seen said the prettiest pict
[23:28] so let let's see some of them she went
[23:31] to her Bible and she pulled them out you
[23:33] know what they was Bank drafts right
[23:36] India puts pictures on their Bank draft
[23:38] you see pretty pictures she had
[23:40] thousands of dollars converted from
[23:42] Indian money into American money what
[23:44] was it in the lens of her Bible she had
[23:46] Treasures that she thought was just
[23:47] pictures but come to find out it was
[23:49] real value to her and he says and
[23:52] brother when you try to read of a
[23:53] painted fire of Pentecost and somebody
[23:56] tries to tell you that the Holy Ghost
[23:58] isn't the same today as it was then
[24:00] somebody tries to tell you the days of
[24:01] Miracles is passed that Jesus Christ
[24:04] isn't the same yesterday today and
[24:05] forever that they try to and they try to
[24:08] tell you don't believe it them's not
[24:10] pictures God Almighty sent that message
[24:13] to you that's right right did he because
[24:16] that's what I believe I believe he sent
[24:18] the message to us it's for you and to
[24:20] your children to them that's far off
[24:23] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[24:24] call God is still God Jesus Christ is
[24:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[24:30] he's here tonight to save the lost to
[24:32] heal the sick to fill with the Holy
[24:33] Ghost those who desire to be filled do
[24:36] you believe that don't you congregation
[24:38] says amen yes sir if you believe it then
[24:41] you see that's God's promises in his in
[24:44] this word here you can get right in
[24:46] there and find every promise the promise
[24:48] is unto you Peter said the promise is
[24:50] unto you and to your children and to
[24:53] them that's a far off don't be afraid to
[24:55] cash that that's a bank draft on H
[24:57] Heaven that's right Jesus Christ the
[24:59] same yesterday and forever right when I
[25:04] go plac that's what because that's what
[25:06] I want everybody to know I want to I
[25:08] want everybody to know that I believe
[25:10] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[25:12] today and forever I don't believe I
[25:14] believe when he started he was the same
[25:16] and he's he's always the same it doesn't
[25:19] matter because it's not it's
[25:21] not uh him that changes it's us that
[25:24] changes because you know what the world
[25:26] changes all things in the world changes
[25:28] but you know what God don't change God
[25:30] has set out set out a plan in motion and
[25:33] he said because it by the law of God it
[25:35] continues on today and it doesn't matter
[25:38] if it's if it's a million years from now
[25:39] it's still going to be the same right
[25:41] right amen
[25:43] amen and he says because if you have a
[25:47] desire he said he's here to meet your
[25:48] desire whatever your need is he's here
[25:50] to meet it he said it's a bankd draft on
[25:53] Heaven because I think that's what
[25:54] happened to a lot of people they take
[25:56] the Bible and the Bible is just a bunch
[25:58] of pretty pictures or the Bible's just
[26:00] for somebody else but you know he said
[26:01] you got to dig in there and find the
[26:03] promises for you because Peter said it's
[26:05] under
[26:06] you right what he brother bam said in
[26:09] the church AG book when he speaking of
[26:10] he said that was to the Jews he said to
[26:12] you the Jews he said and to your
[26:14] children the Jews he said is them that
[26:16] are far off he said Gentiles and he said
[26:19] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[26:21] call he said Jews and Gentiles come on
[26:24] so it's it's but but it's unto us
[26:27] sometimes I think we just find we just
[26:29] look at it as pretty as a pretty picture
[26:31] it's just an idea we say here this woman
[26:33] she carried this thing around for so
[26:35] long and not realizing all that all the
[26:37] things that she had need of laid in
[26:38] front of her that's right brother bam
[26:41] said all that we had need of in this
[26:43] Earthly Journey was given to us in the
[26:45] New Birth come on he said it was it was
[26:47] planted inside of you right on see the
[26:50] thing that stands out to me was when
[26:51] brother you know we quote the scripture
[26:53] where it says brother all that God was
[26:55] he poured into Christ and all that
[26:56] Christ was he poured into into the
[26:57] church come on but you know brother mams
[26:59] also said all that God was he poured
[27:02] into Christ and he said all that Christ
[27:03] was he poured into the believer come on
[27:06] amen that's right because see we don't
[27:09] take it down to an individual level come
[27:11] on because all that God was he poured
[27:14] into me come on
[27:16] Amen it's not for somebody else because
[27:18] it's for me amen I'm not looking to
[27:21] somebody else come on right right
[27:25] blessings it's got to be it's got to be
[27:27] me that's
[27:29] right see the thing is when I when I get
[27:31] I I worry about everybody else I worry
[27:33] about getting me right come on M because
[27:35] see the thing is when I get right just
[27:37] like just like the the little boy that
[27:39] had the puzzle and he had the puzzle
[27:41] tore all the
[27:42] pieces you know he's standing there and
[27:44] he was trying to put the world together
[27:45] and he couldn't and all of a sudden he
[27:47] come back and he told his dad hey I got
[27:48] the picture together he said how did you
[27:51] do that he said well there was a picture
[27:52] of a little boy on the back see when I
[27:55] got one he said it was just the one the
[27:57] little boy he said when I got the boy
[27:58] together he said the whole world was
[28:00] fixed that's
[28:02] right see sometimes the problem is it's
[28:05] like like Jesus was saying you know he
[28:07] said you got something in your eye he
[28:08] said pull the beam out of your eyes
[28:10] before you trying to get out of your
[28:11] brother's eye
[28:13] amen see sometimes people are too
[28:15] worried about what else what everybody
[28:17] else is doing yeah everybody else is get
[28:20] because y y'all have to pardon me
[28:22] tonight cuz I got a few things I just
[28:24] want to say go
[28:26] ahead and it might be it might be wrong
[28:29] y'all I
[28:31] apologize but you know uh I think Hank
[28:33] Williams said it the
[28:36] best he said if you mind your business
[28:38] you won't be mind in mine
[28:43] right right you know i' heard I've heard
[28:46] people stand around and say would you
[28:48] think this person's got the Holy Ghost
[28:49] you think that person's got the Holy
[28:50] Ghost I said well do you have the Holy
[28:53] Ghost
[28:55] only we try to in Phar Phar what
[28:58] everybody else is where everybody else
[28:59] is in the St in the in the pyramid where
[29:02] where they at in the Statue of a perfect
[29:03] man have they reached adoption have they
[29:05] done this is they that is this open to
[29:07] them well you know what you know what
[29:09] you'll find out when the things start
[29:10] opening to you you'll find out where
[29:12] people are right but see the thing is
[29:14] when you start seeing these things in
[29:16] your word then you don't have to worry
[29:17] about where everybody else
[29:21] is see we get we get too concerned about
[29:24] things that are all around us and not
[29:25] worryed about what God's doing
[29:27] right here like brother said he said
[29:30] people people thank God for what he used
[29:31] to do and what he's going to do but they
[29:33] fail to see what he's doing right
[29:37] now see because I believe he said it was
[29:39] supposed to be an individual Affair and
[29:41] if it's supposed to be an individual
[29:43] Affair then it's not is what me it's
[29:45] between me and God not between God and
[29:47] brother dick or anybody else because
[29:50] what what God does for him you know what
[29:52] that I've got to receive the same thing
[29:54] because if it's a word of God and it's a
[29:55] revelation that I've got to receive it
[29:57] too right right I thank God for what
[30:01] brother what what God has opened up to
[30:04] brother brother Dale right amen what
[30:07] what he's what he's done it through this
[30:08] ministry the the the ministry that's
[30:11] here but you know what I've got to
[30:12] receive it for myself that's right I'm
[30:15] not going I'm not I guarantee you one
[30:17] thing I'm not going through on brother
[30:18] D's coat table that's right and nobody
[30:20] else is either
[30:22] amen you know what I tell you this much
[30:24] I don't want to blessing
[30:28] I don't want to walk around say brother
[30:29] Dale's my pastor I want I want to know
[30:32] God for myself that's right because
[30:34] that's what brother Dell does he comes
[30:35] and open tries to reveal the word to us
[30:37] speak the word to us because God has to
[30:39] reveal it to us amen but you know that's
[30:41] the reason he said it's like a c a
[30:43] grinding
[30:44] stone well sometimes I get over because
[30:47] I do it for anybody else in this whole
[30:48] building but he does it for me
[30:51] right cuz you know what I'm not
[30:53] hardheaded B it takes me not long to
[30:56] figure these things out oh
[31:00] my see some you know it's not everybody
[31:03] else it's
[31:04] me he said one person can make this
[31:07] whole church bitterly fail right he said
[31:10] you be you'll be a judgment you don't
[31:12] have to answer for
[31:14] it so it's not it's not whoever else in
[31:17] this church it's me I want to make sure
[31:19] that I'm
[31:21] right see the thing is you can find like
[31:24] brother said you can find a counterfeit
[31:25] he said can you find a genuine
[31:27] that's why we're looking for something
[31:28] that's genuine something that's real
[31:40] amen Jesus said in in
[31:43] John he
[31:46] said he said how be it when he the
[31:48] spirit of Truth has come he said he'll
[31:50] lead and guide you into all truth right
[31:54] amen see if we if we receive this then
[31:58] he will lead us and guide us into all
[32:01] things the truth then that's where he
[32:03] said he was going to take
[32:05] us if it's if it's if it's a promise of
[32:08] God and you've received that then guess
[32:09] what you be you be carried in he'll lead
[32:12] you into
[32:16] truth brother Brown says in Rising of
[32:18] son he said now the very essence of the
[32:20] message that was sent was that he is
[32:23] risen from the dead we his beneficiaries
[32:27] who share the resurrection with him draw
[32:29] benefits from this by proving to the
[32:31] world that He Is Alive we cannot do it
[32:33] by word only we cannot do this by some
[32:35] tradition of man we only ref reflect
[32:39] exactly what we're pointing to he said
[32:42] I'm afraid today that too many of us are
[32:44] not getting to people to Christ but
[32:45] we're getting them to a church to a
[32:47] theory but we must get them to Christ he
[32:50] is the only one and the only one that
[32:52] has life that's
[32:54] right he's dropped down and brother says
[32:56] Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of
[32:59] but if the spirit that raised Christ
[33:01] from the dead dwells in you he and also
[33:02] quickens your mortal body that same life
[33:05] them same Powers them same beneficiaries
[33:08] that he had here on Earth from God he
[33:11] redeemed you a seed that was for on of
[33:13] God th whose names were put on the
[33:15] Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation
[33:17] of the world and that Gospel Light of
[33:19] the Resurrection the confirmation of the
[33:22] word how did he know he was the Christ
[33:26] how did we know that he was the Christ
[33:28] because he proved what he what he talked
[33:30] about how will I know the message of the
[33:32] hour God proves what he promised and he
[33:35] talks about it right
[33:37] right see it's we've got to get people
[33:40] to Christ not to a church not to a
[33:42] theory because a lot because you know
[33:44] we've seen too many people because it's
[33:46] such it's such a late hour people have
[33:48] gotten to the message oh yeah but see
[33:51] the thing is it's not just because the
[33:53] scripture says the letter kth but the
[33:55] spirit gives life and that's what we
[33:57] need we need to have the life right it's
[33:59] the spirit that's going to Quicken the
[34:01] word right well because you know the
[34:03] thing is he said if he lead you and
[34:04] guide you into all truth and one of the
[34:07] things is he said that you know you
[34:08] cannot be uh
[34:12] deceived right you know I've heard
[34:15] people heard people talk about that you
[34:17] know that uh you know they're afraid to
[34:20] listen they're afraid they're going to
[34:21] get deceived oh
[34:25] my well you he said if you're if you're
[34:27] an elect of God you can't be deceived
[34:29] then what are you worried about right
[34:32] amen see people get so confused they're
[34:34] so afraid that's right come well maybe
[34:37] the problem is is they're not where they
[34:38] think they are oh my come on May maybe
[34:42] they don't have the Holy Spirit leading
[34:43] them come
[34:44] on maybe that's the reason there is so
[34:47] many doctrines in the message oh my why
[34:50] because there not the Holy Ghost leading
[34:52] come on right we got too many people
[34:54] trying to build trying to build a great
[34:55] Kingdom to theel
[34:57] trying to come up with some idea to draw
[34:59] people to them and not trying to draw
[35:01] people to Christ come
[35:06] on this is from birth pains I know some
[35:10] some of it's very you heard it many
[35:12] times but just what's been on my heart
[35:15] he said that's why I think today that we
[35:17] have not not so many rather genuine New
[35:20] Birth is because the seed maybe will
[35:23] sympathize with the word or the person
[35:26] but they don't want to rot away from the
[35:29] old system they were in come on they
[35:32] don't want to come out of it they want
[35:34] to stay in the old system and claim the
[35:36] new birth or the message of the
[35:39] age see that's what's wrong with a lot
[35:41] of people they gotten comfortable they
[35:44] got their own they got their four walls
[35:47] they live in their own little
[35:48] realm but see the thing is is they don't
[35:50] want to go beyond that they don't want
[35:52] to die out and come into the place where
[35:55] God wants them to come to
[35:58] right why because people are such in
[36:00] such a shape so so
[36:04] afraid but see the thing
[36:06] is and I want you understand this
[36:08] because I'm speaking on the I I'm
[36:10] speaking on the Promises of God I want
[36:12] you understand
[36:14] this because see that is a promise of
[36:17] God that you don't have to live like
[36:19] that right
[36:20] right because you know there there's
[36:22] something
[36:24] greater people people have just come to
[36:26] a certain point and they can't they see
[36:27] can't seem to understand why they can't
[36:29] go beyond
[36:32] that see it's so it's so hard to get
[36:35] people to see that there's so there's so
[36:38] much more out there God is infinite come
[36:42] on and he's Eternal so I mean what we
[36:44] have today what we can't understand that
[36:47] what we have we can't what God has for
[36:50] us we're not even we can't even put in
[36:52] our finite Minds come
[36:55] on we have because there's more for us
[36:58] more for God of God for us to receive
[37:01] that we we can uh
[37:04] obtain because he said he'd open up the
[37:06] windows of Heaven pour out a
[37:08] blessing that you you would not be able
[37:10] to contain right see there's so much for
[37:14] us to receive from God and then he said
[37:16] there would be a a message to cheer down
[37:18] through the endless ages
[37:23] amen and you
[37:25] know every every aspect of of God every
[37:29] aspect of the believer's walk you know
[37:32] it's God leading you that's right right
[37:36] you know I try to express this
[37:38] everywhere I go you know there's a
[37:40] definite experience of justification
[37:43] amen because you know he he said there
[37:46] was he said the mystery was receiving
[37:48] the new birth without a
[37:50] sensation but he never said it wouldn't
[37:52] come without an experience on right
[37:55] justification there's a definite
[37:57] experience of justification right it's
[38:00] the leading of the Holy Ghost see people
[38:03] people want to ask about Revelation you
[38:06] know justification is a
[38:09] revelation sanctification is a
[38:12] revelation it's the leading of the Holy
[38:14] Ghost for leading you into these into
[38:16] these stages that he's leading you into
[38:21] justification see you because he said
[38:23] you can know where you are with God at
[38:24] any time so if you if he only lead you
[38:27] to justification then you can know
[38:28] you're Justified you can know you're
[38:33] Sanctified see people people have just
[38:35] LA and the devil has taught them into
[38:37] believe that they received
[38:40] something that they received the new
[38:43] birth that they're born again they're
[38:44] all
[38:46] right and sometimes they're a million
[38:48] miles from
[38:50] it but see it's the leading of the Holy
[38:52] Ghost see problem is everybody thinks oh
[38:55] we've got it
[38:57] and nobody wants to check up right right
[39:00] you know I've never had a I've never had
[39:02] a pastor or known of a Preacher like
[39:04] brother Dale who stands there and say
[39:05] you know he said I'd rather seek for the
[39:07] Holy Ghost every day of my life and die
[39:10] and realize I had it all the time and
[39:12] not ever seek seek it and sit around and
[39:15] think that I've got it and come to the
[39:16] end and realize I don't have it
[39:21] right because people want to Pat Pat the
[39:24] people on the in the in the church on
[39:25] the head and tell you're all
[39:29] right see it's it's a checking up
[39:33] time we need to get to a place where we
[39:35] seek and and really find out if we got
[39:37] it or not that's
[39:38] right that's
[39:41] right and I know this may be simple to a
[39:44] lot of you but you know what if if if I
[39:47] touch one person in my life you know
[39:49] it's all it's all worth it right yes sir
[39:53] because you know what I've seen I've
[39:54] seen too many kids just walk by
[39:57] right because you know what I was a
[39:59] teenager in this
[40:01] message I know what it's
[40:04] like I know what it's like to walk
[40:06] around and Jack because as brother
[40:08] Donnie said one
[40:10] time talk about kids growing up just
[40:12] cutting their teeth on a message Pew I
[40:14] was that kind of
[40:17] kid see I know what it's like to grow up
[40:19] in the
[40:21] message but see the thing is we always
[40:23] you know ever since I had a conscious
[40:25] thought in my life I always brother V
[40:26] was a
[40:28] prophet but you know what that didn't do
[40:30] me any
[40:32] good I always always knew that this was
[40:34] the
[40:36] truth you know I never could get away
[40:38] from it I I went to denominational
[40:40] churches and sit in there you know what
[40:42] you can't get away from this message
[40:44] that's
[40:46] right can't do it I tell you what
[40:48] because I I've sat in churches and
[40:50] listen to people preach on the
[40:51] trinitarian doctrine and you know it's
[40:53] just like rubbing a cat the wrong
[40:55] way that's right there's just something
[40:58] inside of me that just couldn't handle
[41:01] that and see that's so and and so I've
[41:05] seen a lot of kids they they get so they
[41:07] get so bound up with things that are
[41:09] just
[41:10] false right right that's right you see
[41:13] somebody's got to stand up because Satan
[41:15] will always bring out the counterfeit
[41:17] he's always going to show you the ones
[41:19] that are messed up but you know what you
[41:21] need to find a real genuine to look at
[41:24] right that's why I want to be because I
[41:26] want to be the one that somebody can
[41:27] look at and see there's there's a Son of
[41:29] God that's somebody that's true that's
[41:32] had a real true birth not just some idea
[41:35] of it and I want everybody know as like
[41:37] brother Dale said that you you know you
[41:40] you get born again he said that's what
[41:42] it's one of the thing he's always wanted
[41:43] to give away to continue to try to give
[41:46] that away to somebody for somebody else
[41:48] to come the same way
[41:53] right
[41:55] blessing
[41:57] that's what we
[42:01] need need to Revelation
[42:07] right because we need to
[42:11] come we have young
[42:15] people you know Satan Satan's just he he
[42:18] loves to get his hands on on these
[42:21] kids and it's not just here but it's all
[42:23] over and you see it and I mean that's
[42:27] the great that's the greatest Victory he
[42:28] has is when he can destroy some kid's
[42:31] life some young person's
[42:35] life you know it's it's sad but you see
[42:39] the these people a lots of times I've
[42:42] not been to camps in a number of years
[42:44] but you know I've been to camps
[42:46] before and it's and it's not something
[42:48] that they spend their time preaching
[42:50] about re receiving the new birth but
[42:53] it's all about about their music
[42:56] and their clothes and their hair and all
[42:58] these different things right right you
[43:01] know what I've never seen a teenager
[43:03] that actually got born again that had
[43:06] problems come
[43:08] on you don't have to worry about their
[43:12] music that's right you don't have to
[43:14] worry about their
[43:18] clothes but the problem is he said we've
[43:20] not reached
[43:23] that kids have not come to that place
[43:27] and see the thing is it's not waiting on
[43:29] on them to grow up and receive
[43:33] it because it's something that they can
[43:35] receive at a very young age right and I
[43:37] know I know God brings up bring us in
[43:40] our own
[43:42] time but sometimes people are waiting
[43:44] because they're waiting for them the
[43:45] kids well they need to be a little
[43:48] older no I I want God to get a hold of
[43:50] them when they're young so they don't
[43:51] have to go through the same things that
[43:53] I went
[43:54] through yes sir see is when when you
[43:56] don't when you don't have to go through
[43:57] those things and you don't have to have
[43:59] those things where the devil battles you
[44:00] in your mind
[44:03] over all the things you done in the
[44:06] world and I thank God that that I didn't
[44:08] do you know a lot of things that other
[44:12] people did that they carry they still
[44:14] carry those things in their life but you
[44:17] know
[44:17] what I I'm so God so glad that God
[44:21] brought me from where I was
[44:23] at you know I don't I don't glory in any
[44:25] of the things that I went through in my
[44:27] life the things I done in in the in Sin
[44:30] out in the world I I'm glad that I God
[44:32] got me away from them that's
[44:35] right because you know I don't glory in
[44:37] any of
[44:38] it that's right you know because a lot
[44:41] of people you know they've not really
[44:42] come to a place where they're really
[44:43] ashamed of what they
[44:46] done but you know I'm so glad that I've
[44:48] gotten away from those
[44:51] things that I can say I know what it's
[44:53] like to be
[44:54] free because you know you go back and
[44:57] you look and I know what it's like to be
[45:01] bound and the devil's got you right
[45:03] where he wants you right and he and he
[45:06] gets everything he just squeezes
[45:09] you I remember sitting on a porch as a
[45:14] teenager and bound by cigarettes and you
[45:17] I just sitting there shaking I trying to
[45:20] quit and couldn't and just sit there and
[45:23] just just try to do anything to get that
[45:25] off off your
[45:28] mind but you know why I'm so glad that I
[45:31] was able to lay those things down and
[45:32] never never desired to have another one
[45:35] put them behind
[45:37] me see there's things there's things
[45:40] that the devil gets all over you you
[45:42] know those things that that people
[45:44] battle with lust and and different
[45:45] things and rock and roll country music
[45:48] and different things in the
[45:49] world and you know he he said if you
[45:52] don't if you don't give uh your kids to
[45:54] Christ he said Rock and rolls going to
[45:56] get
[45:57] him and what did he do he just turned
[45:59] around and he took and he took rock and
[46:01] roll and he mixed it with gospel it is a
[46:05] it is the biggest mess of Filth you ever
[46:10] seen and what they do they just bring it
[46:12] right into the
[46:15] churches and they feed on
[46:18] that and it and people don't realize it
[46:20] came straight out of the pits of
[46:24] hell
[46:32] is from
[46:33] Hebrews Hebrews
[46:35] 9 9:14 says how much more shall the
[46:39] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[46:43] spirit offered himself without spot to
[46:45] God Purge your conscience from dead
[46:47] Works to serve the Living
[46:54] God go he spent he sent his word to us
[46:59] amen and to be quickened by the word by
[47:01] the
[47:03] spirit he said to purge us from Purge
[47:05] our
[47:06] conscience he said it was a desire to do
[47:09] away with the desire of of the things of
[47:11] the world to serve a living
[47:13] God that we can be free from those
[47:15] things to be purged from them brother
[47:18] said in the message what is the Holy
[47:23] Ghost he said that's what the
[47:26] we don't get sealed so much he said
[47:28] we're too loose about things when the
[47:30] inspector goes through to inspect your
[47:32] life to see if you're not just a little
[47:35] loose about things a little loose about
[47:37] your prayer life a little loose about
[47:39] your temper about that temper a little
[47:41] loose about that tongue to talk about
[47:43] others he'll never seal that
[47:47] car that's the reason we've not come to
[47:50] that
[47:51] place people people think that they've
[47:53] received something but they not come to
[47:54] that place because they're little Lo
[47:57] Lo he said they not they not got that
[48:00] car
[48:03] sealed can you can you imagine that
[48:06] coming to this
[48:09] place and the thing that that stood out
[48:11] to
[48:13] me you know we don't we don't have a a
[48:18] desire but you you go back and look in
[48:20] the Old Testament with Aaron where the
[48:24] high priest when he got prepared to go
[48:26] into the holies of
[48:27] holies you know
[48:30] brother you know everything had to be
[48:32] just
[48:33] right the clothes the way he bathed
[48:36] himself had to be a certain way every
[48:39] every garment had to be in a certain way
[48:41] in a certain everything proper and in
[48:44] its way in its place before he went
[48:48] in right and see you know there he was
[48:51] he had to take Moses's word for
[48:54] it
[48:56] that you know Moses did you make sure
[48:57] you got all the words right is this
[48:59] exactly the way it is because when he
[49:02] went in there it was
[49:04] death right and see the thing is we
[49:06] don't approach it the same way we don't
[49:09] approach it with the same
[49:11] sincerity because if we approach it the
[49:13] same way then it wouldn't then would he
[49:15] he would be sealing
[49:17] us then then people wouldn't be sealed
[49:20] right but it's not because people have
[49:21] not come to the same place where they
[49:23] actually have a deathly sincerity to it
[49:26] not realizing that the minor things in
[49:29] your life how important they are the
[49:31] Minor
[49:32] Details because it would if he if he
[49:34] missed some minor detail that high
[49:36] priest was dead right he didn't have a
[49:38] do
[49:39] over when he went before when he went
[49:41] into the holies of holies he had to be
[49:43] right and
[49:44] perfect right he was
[49:47] dead and it's the same way with us we
[49:50] have to be exactly right ex reach reach
[49:53] that exact place everything has to be
[49:56] perfect be
[50:01] spotless it's something because we look
[50:03] at him we
[50:04] say well I can't reach
[50:07] that but guess what if you if you trust
[50:10] God he'll bring you to that
[50:14] place see we look at we say you know
[50:16] because we wonder sometimes we we read
[50:19] these
[50:22] things and you know in the scripture
[50:24] where it says you know he said you know
[50:25] you be you'll be made fun of he said
[50:28] blessed are when when men revile you and
[50:30] say all manner of evil against you amen
[50:33] when they persecute
[50:34] you he said blessed are you right see
[50:39] you're you're a you're a blessed person
[50:41] right he said rejoice and be exceedingly
[50:44] glad
[50:46] right see he's going to if he's going to
[50:49] lead you and guide you into all truth if
[50:51] he's going to bring you to these places
[50:54] but you're going to you're going to be
[50:55] pressured you're going to be persecuted
[50:58] but you're blessed by
[51:00] it see then you got to realize you know
[51:02] I'm
[51:03] blessed that he's going to bring me to
[51:06] that place I can't get there on my own
[51:08] but he's he's obligated to bring me
[51:10] there
[51:11] yes right that I'm that I'm
[51:20] blessed this is from Trum me gives an
[51:23] uncertain
[51:24] sound
[51:28] but see when you come into a place that
[51:32] you have receed the new
[51:35] birth because it is a definite
[51:37] experience amen of justification and
[51:39] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[51:42] Ghost amen not just not just the baptism
[51:44] of the Holy Ghost but there's a definite
[51:47] experience that takes
[51:48] place and when you've come to that place
[51:51] then guess what he said all the all the
[51:53] devils in hell are against you every
[51:55] gun's going to be trained against you
[51:58] brother says an uncertain
[52:01] sound it's like St training a so like
[52:04] training a
[52:07] soldier he said now A Soldier's got to
[52:09] learn the sound of his bugle or the
[52:11] trumpet he doesn't know if the trumpet
[52:14] goes blows whether whether to charge or
[52:17] to retreat and he doesn't know the
[52:19] difference what kind of mixed up Army
[52:21] would you have the enemy C would
[52:23] certainly triumph over a bunch of
[52:24] soldiers that was no better trained than
[52:26] that amen that's what's the matter with
[52:29] our churches today we're trained we've
[52:31] trained them on Creeds different one to
[52:33] the other we got to be United we've got
[52:36] to know a trumpet then which then which
[52:39] is the trumpet they say the gospel
[52:41] trumpet that's it the word of the Living
[52:43] God is the trumpet don't mix nothing
[52:45] with
[52:47] it he goes on says now army war it's
[52:51] always been a war we never join the
[52:53] church or come into a church to come to
[52:55] a picnic we must realize that we are
[52:58] coming to a
[52:59] Battleground we never come for people to
[53:02] Pat me on the back and say brother
[53:03] brandom you're a wonderful person no sir
[53:05] I come here with a shield on I don't
[53:08] need a shield I don't need a shield for
[53:10] that I come with a helmet and the armor
[53:12] I come to fight fight every inch of the
[53:14] ground God told Joshua every place The
[53:17] Souls of your foot Treads upon that I
[53:19] will give you so footsteps meant
[53:21] possession and when the church gets to a
[53:24] place that come from ises with Creeds
[53:26] and compromises with the word and
[53:27] compromises with the world I mean then
[53:29] it's losing ground it's taking back he
[53:32] said what we need tonight as soldiers to
[53:34] possess every Divine promise of this
[53:36] Bible that God promised to the church
[53:38] whole armor of God and to stand what we
[53:40] need soldiers not get a uniform for a
[53:43] dress parade it's always
[53:46] different see God didn't call us for a
[53:48] dress
[53:50] parade see we come in he didn't call us
[53:53] to a picnic he called us to a battle
[53:55] right he said he said you know I I come
[53:58] to get a armor I come to get into to the
[54:01] armor of
[54:03] God because there's a
[54:10] battle Ephesians
[54:14] 6 right he says finally my brethren be
[54:18] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[54:19] His might he says put on the whole armor
[54:21] of God that you may be able to stand
[54:23] against the Ws of the devil he said for
[54:25] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[54:27] but against principalities against
[54:29] Powers against the rulers of the
[54:30] darkness of this world against spiritual
[54:32] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[54:35] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[54:37] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[54:41] and having done all to stand stand
[54:43] therefore having your loins G about with
[54:46] truth and having on the breastplate of
[54:50] righteousness Jesus said he said You
[54:52] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[54:53] set you free right
[54:56] right brother bam said in the SM Church
[54:59] age he said no True Believer is any
[55:02] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[55:04] Alive than in his knowledge of and
[55:06] adherence to the pure word of God as
[55:09] seen by multitudes of examples in the
[55:11] Old
[55:13] Testament so you have to be GED about
[55:16] with truth he said he would lead you
[55:18] into all truth so you have the take on
[55:22] the
[55:23] truth and you I was reading something on
[55:27] that you know that's the basic part of
[55:29] the armor to hold everything together
[55:31] was was the loins being guarded about to
[55:34] hold everything into place so it takes
[55:40] truth because it's not just some truth
[55:42] but it takes all the truth and that's
[55:44] what he leads you into he said and your
[55:46] feet sh with the preparation of the
[55:48] gospel of
[55:51] peace he
[55:54] said it be ready to do what the word of
[55:56] God calls
[55:58] for to be shot about have your feet shot
[56:01] with the gospel to do whatever whatever
[56:04] the word calls you to do to be able to
[56:07] speak the word as the scripture says be
[56:10] instant in season and out of season be
[56:13] prepared you know the in the in the Old
[56:16] Testament the children of Israel when
[56:17] they got ready to leave Egypt you know
[56:20] they had to they had to be completely
[56:21] ready God calls them and tells them they
[56:24] had to get completely ready but when
[56:25] they ready to eat the lamb that when
[56:28] they they roasted the lamb and put the
[56:29] blood on the door you know they had to
[56:30] be ready to leave Egypt they had their
[56:33] shoes on they were ready to go and so
[56:35] that's the way you are you have to be
[56:37] prepared for whatever whatever the word
[56:39] God calls you to do right and he says
[56:42] above all taking the shield of Faith
[56:45] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[56:46] all the fiery darts of the
[56:48] wicked have faith yes sir it takes a
[56:52] revelation yes sir takes it you have to
[56:55] have the Revelation to quench these
[56:58] fiery darts but you know what he said
[57:01] because it's given to you because if
[57:03] you're if he because the thing is it's
[57:05] not with something that God's holding
[57:07] back from you because Paul is saying
[57:09] you've got to take the whole armor right
[57:11] he said you take on the armor of God
[57:13] right he said guard yourself with it
[57:15] right so it's something you've got to do
[57:18] it's something that that you've been
[57:19] given but you've got to equip yourself
[57:22] and he says and take on the the helmet
[57:23] of salvation and the sword of the spirit
[57:26] which is the word of God right the
[57:29] helmet protect
[57:32] you because we know that was the chosen
[57:34] Battleground the
[57:36] Mind God chose the M you know Satan
[57:39] chose the Mind God chose the heart but
[57:41] that was where the battle taking place
[57:43] he said that's your protection of the
[57:46] chosen
[57:50] Battleground because you realized it
[57:53] that's where you that's where the Bible
[57:54] going to take place in your
[57:57] mind and you've got and in your mind see
[57:59] that's where you have to confess you've
[58:02] got to come to the place where you
[58:03] confess it and think on it dwell on it
[58:06] it's got to be a positive thought
[58:10] amen because you know what if you think
[58:12] if you have those thoughts as brother
[58:14] Ernie was talking about you know your
[58:16] thoughts lead to words right your words
[58:19] lead to actions and your actions lead to
[58:23] Destiny so he said he your high the high
[58:26] priest is your confession he said is
[58:28] whatever you confess that's what that's
[58:30] the only way that he can intercede the
[58:31] only thing he intercedes on is your
[58:34] confession so you got to be equipped
[58:37] with the
[58:41] helmet You' got to come to your
[58:44] confession because that's what in
[58:46] Revelation it tells us he said he said
[58:49] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[58:52] and the word of their testimony that's
[58:54] right it's like they said that's why
[58:56] they
[59:00] overcome brother Bram
[59:03] said this is a message Queen of
[59:08] Sheba said the only way that you can be
[59:10] saved is by faith he said you've got to
[59:12] look at the
[59:14] Unseen and a whole armor of Christianity
[59:17] is
[59:18] Supernatural people say how that a man
[59:20] can say that he believes in God and
[59:22] preaches in a church and says he does
[59:24] not believe in the supernatural when the
[59:26] whole armor of God the whole armor of
[59:27] Christianity is Supernatural amen he
[59:30] said what is the armor of
[59:33] Christianity love joy peace
[59:35] longsuffering goodness meekness patience
[59:36] Faith Holy Ghost all these things are
[59:40] Supernatural that's what you've been G
[59:42] about
[59:43] with that you've been
[59:45] given Lord all these things are given to
[59:48] you that you can G yourself
[59:51] with you know I was I was preaching
[59:54] sometimes back and I I was telling you
[59:56] you go back and you read the
[59:58] scriptures see I have I have peace like
[1:00:02] a
[1:00:03] river why because he said I had
[1:00:06] it you know I don't I don't have any
[1:00:09] sorrow why because he took it away from
[1:00:13] me he said he carried our grief and took
[1:00:15] our
[1:00:17] sorrows well if that's true that I don't
[1:00:19] have it anymore right why because he
[1:00:21] took it from me right
[1:00:26] if he's carrying it for me brother Mark
[1:00:27] then I don't have
[1:00:30] it I have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:00:34] Glory I have
[1:00:36] patience why because that is a attribute
[1:00:39] of him and if it's an attribute of him
[1:00:42] then that's what I have that's right
[1:00:45] whether whether I whether I I I manifest
[1:00:48] it or not it's mine right it's a part of
[1:00:53] me every bit of this is me I have love
[1:00:57] joy peace meekness goodness that's who I
[1:01:02] am amen whether whether whether I
[1:01:04] manifest it or not it's it's who I am
[1:01:07] that's right why because if you don't
[1:01:09] confess it you never come to it
[1:01:16] amen I
[1:01:20] told told Brother David
[1:01:22] Sunday said you get no my sermon
[1:01:25] Wednesday
[1:01:27] night and
[1:01:29] uh I had this I had this in my notes and
[1:01:32] and he was reading
[1:01:35] it it's from the Lamb's Book of L I read
[1:01:38] it part of again he said he makes no
[1:01:40] mistakes he said he wouldn't bring you
[1:01:42] in if you wasn't worthy he knows your
[1:01:45] heart that's right he knows what you are
[1:01:47] he knows your motives he knows what you
[1:01:49] are there's traps all along the road
[1:01:50] sure the devil will cause you to stumble
[1:01:52] and you say God I didn't mean to do that
[1:01:54] that God you know it you're still
[1:01:56] perfect because there's a perfect blood
[1:01:57] offered for you every day and a bleeding
[1:02:00] sacrifice hanging there before the
[1:02:02] Throne of almighty God that's
[1:02:06] right I'm so glad that he knows that he
[1:02:09] that he knows where we start he knows
[1:02:12] all about us he said if you he would
[1:02:15] bring you in if you wasn't
[1:02:18] worthy see it's it's not it's not if I'm
[1:02:21] worthy or not because he's worthy right
[1:02:25] because the scripture says he that knew
[1:02:28] no sin he became sin he didn't become
[1:02:31] sinful but he took on sin he took on my
[1:02:34] sin that I might become the
[1:02:35] righteousness of
[1:02:37] God brother said he said it was the very
[1:02:40] righteousness of God he said to believe
[1:02:42] one was to believe the other and he said
[1:02:45] to deny one was to deny the other right
[1:02:48] so if I've accepted him that he's taken
[1:02:50] my sin that I don't have any sin then
[1:02:53] automatically I've become the
[1:02:55] righteousness of God
[1:02:57] right I because I've taken on what he's
[1:03:00] given
[1:03:01] me whether whether I believeing or not
[1:03:04] but you know what you confess it right
[1:03:06] whether you see it or not you confess
[1:03:14] it as the scripture tells us or brother
[1:03:17] R was talking about you know the biggest
[1:03:19] portion of our faith is mental Faith
[1:03:21] that's right he said but you've got to
[1:03:23] take a mental faith and he said when you
[1:03:25] pour the word of God into a mental Faith
[1:03:27] he said then it becomes a spiritual
[1:03:29] Revelation so you've got to come to a
[1:03:31] place that everything you say it lines
[1:03:33] up with the word right right you know
[1:03:36] I've heard people say I don't know what
[1:03:38] I'm going to
[1:03:40] do I you know I don't know how this is
[1:03:43] going to take place or what you know are
[1:03:45] all these
[1:03:46] things so we shouldn't be saying things
[1:03:49] like that right so you know what I trust
[1:03:52] God he's going to give me the answer
[1:03:54] amen because if I give it to God I don't
[1:03:57] have to know how it works because he'll
[1:03:58] take care of it right the problem is if
[1:04:01] I get myself out of the way then he can
[1:04:02] do the work but lotten times the problem
[1:04:05] is is we get in the
[1:04:07] way we hinder God from
[1:04:10] working but see you know we we don't
[1:04:13] need to say these things because we need
[1:04:14] to say what he
[1:04:16] said we need to confess what he says
[1:04:19] it's a the same
[1:04:23] thing
[1:04:26] this is from testimony of the sea
[1:04:28] testimony on the
[1:04:32] sea now I like this brother says
[1:04:36] remember you don't pet Christians
[1:04:39] Christians are rugged they are men and
[1:04:42] women of God who stand for God
[1:04:43] regardless of what anybody else has to
[1:04:45] say you don't have to beg them and
[1:04:48] persuade them and perfume them and baby
[1:04:50] them around that's hot bed hybrid plants
[1:04:53] it's no good at all they'll never
[1:04:55] produce nothing
[1:04:58] right so the thing is is now if we take
[1:05:01] if we take what he said he said
[1:05:02] Christians are
[1:05:04] rugged you don't have to pet
[1:05:07] Christians well then guess what whether
[1:05:10] whether however I go if you know my
[1:05:13] confession ought to be I'm rugged right
[1:05:15] you don't have to pet me you don't have
[1:05:17] to persuade me you don't have to per
[1:05:19] perfume me I'm
[1:05:22] rugged and I walk in
[1:05:26] that because that's what he's given me
[1:05:29] because he said if not he said you're a
[1:05:31] hybrid hot bled plant and they'll never
[1:05:33] produce nothing right then you know what
[1:05:36] I ought to say I'm producing what he's
[1:05:38] what he's given me to produce he's
[1:05:40] producing Jesus Christ in me Hallelujah
[1:05:43] that's why it's being produced in me
[1:05:45] because I'm not I'm not a hot bed plant
[1:05:48] I'm
[1:05:50] rugged I'm I'm born with a
[1:05:53] backbone
[1:05:54] no matter how many times you get run
[1:05:57] over see Shemar stood there all those
[1:06:01] times he got run
[1:06:02] over but you know what it didn't change
[1:06:05] him every time the Philistines stole
[1:06:06] everything that he had it didn't change
[1:06:08] who he was that's
[1:06:10] right the whole time he was he was a an
[1:06:14] Israelite he was he was under the
[1:06:17] Covenant he didn't change it when he
[1:06:19] gave everything to him when he allowed
[1:06:21] him to destroy everything right but you
[1:06:24] know what one day he stood up and said
[1:06:26] they won't take anything else from
[1:06:29] me see when he took on that see it was
[1:06:31] always there he always was that but one
[1:06:34] day he stood up and he took them
[1:06:38] on and his brother Ron was s about you
[1:06:40] know they made a terrible
[1:06:42] mistake said one can put a th000 to
[1:06:44] flight they only brought
[1:06:50] 600 see they didn't realize they the
[1:06:52] Philistines were terribly
[1:06:56] numbered see if we look at it we look at
[1:06:58] it all
[1:07:00] backwards when we look at it and and it
[1:07:02] was Elisha stand there talking to gazi
[1:07:04] on the
[1:07:06] mountain so he was looking at the armies
[1:07:08] and all the people that were all around
[1:07:11] and he said he said don't worry he said
[1:07:12] there's more with us than they are with
[1:07:14] them
[1:07:16] right what are you talking about he said
[1:07:20] Lord open his eyes that he can see right
[1:07:22] see how the man was on fire and all the
[1:07:24] ones that were around the Heavenly Host
[1:07:25] all around
[1:07:27] them see there was God to protect them
[1:07:29] to take care of
[1:07:32] them but see they didn't see
[1:07:35] that brother bam said if we can only see
[1:07:37] in that other realm he said we would see
[1:07:39] the angel sitting on the pews that's
[1:07:43] right oh we think it's somewhere else no
[1:07:46] it's right here that's right bless
[1:07:49] amen so he's not meeting somewhere else
[1:07:51] he's meeting right here why because you
[1:07:54] brought your lick of fire I brought mine
[1:07:56] he said wherever two or three are
[1:07:58] gathered in my name I'm in the midst
[1:08:00] that's right
[1:08:02] amen see there reason I read that quote
[1:08:05] everywhere I go see he's here to meet
[1:08:06] your
[1:08:08] needs he said there's a bankdraft on
[1:08:11] Heaven he said before he would let one
[1:08:14] of his promises fail he said he would
[1:08:16] bankrupt
[1:08:18] Heaven see we we fail to realize where
[1:08:21] we're standing where we're sitting
[1:08:24] yeah many times brother Dane and I have
[1:08:27] talked about how many times we've talked
[1:08:28] about people who are understanding that
[1:08:30] that when people come for prayer people
[1:08:32] are not receiving their
[1:08:34] healing what's going on something is
[1:08:36] failing something is
[1:08:40] wrong and sometimes people
[1:08:42] just yeah he said drive us into
[1:08:48] desperation he should wake us
[1:08:51] up he should R Us to a place F what God
[1:08:55] why aren't you
[1:08:58] moving maybe that's what we don't want
[1:09:00] them to move
[1:09:03] yeah we're just
[1:09:08] comfortable we just comfortable where we
[1:09:10] at we we like
[1:09:12] it see that's what happened to the
[1:09:14] children of Israel right they got to a
[1:09:17] place where they got comfortable
[1:09:19] right so God just had to stir the pot a
[1:09:22] little bit
[1:09:24] send him a little some folks along to
[1:09:28] make their little clubm vacation wasn't
[1:09:30] a vacation
[1:09:33] anymore brother say this is forsaking
[1:09:38] all he says you can expect the world to
[1:09:41] make fun of you you can expect the world
[1:09:44] to call you all kinds of unhonorable
[1:09:46] names they'll call you anything that
[1:09:49] they can call you you'll be despised and
[1:09:52] rejected Jesus because of of him being
[1:09:54] Emanuel God dwelling in him it made him
[1:09:56] so odd to his own church till his own
[1:09:59] church excommunicated him as soon as he
[1:10:02] come
[1:10:07] in they was the one who hung him on the
[1:10:09] cross they was the one who condemned him
[1:10:12] he loved people his whole heart was for
[1:10:15] people but he had to forsake everything
[1:10:17] in order to follow God and so do we have
[1:10:20] to forsake everything in order to follow
[1:10:22] God now what do I get in return we don't
[1:10:26] expect sometimes I think we ministers
[1:10:27] make it a little too much flowers for
[1:10:29] the convert Oh Come to Christ everything
[1:10:32] is lovely but you see it isn't like that
[1:10:35] saying that everything's a flowery bed
[1:10:37] of ease because no Christian the Bible
[1:10:39] says all that live Godly in Christ shall
[1:10:42] suffer persecution so if you're not
[1:10:44] suffering persecution for Christ's sake
[1:10:47] then there's something wrong if the
[1:10:48] devil ain't after you he's got you
[1:10:50] that's all because as long as he's after
[1:10:52] you there a sign that's a he hasn't got
[1:10:54] you yet but if he isn't after you it's a
[1:10:57] sign that he has got you he's got you
[1:11:04] yet 1 Corinthians 10:13 says there hath
[1:11:07] no temptation taken you but such is
[1:11:10] common to man but God is faithful who
[1:11:12] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[1:11:14] that you are able but will with the
[1:11:16] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:11:19] that you may be able to Bear
[1:11:21] it so if we're going to come to these
[1:11:24] we're going to be tested we're going to
[1:11:25] be tried we're going to be made fun
[1:11:28] of but you know what he's going to make
[1:11:30] a way of Escape for us so we going to go
[1:11:33] through these things because if if they
[1:11:36] called the man the the head of the house
[1:11:41] they called him be what are they going
[1:11:42] to say about you
[1:11:47] amen see we're going to go through these
[1:11:49] things you're going to face these
[1:11:51] things see that's a that's the promise
[1:11:54] of God that's that's what you're facing
[1:11:57] but brother Brown says in the message
[1:12:01] identification he said and now being
[1:12:04] that we have identified ourselves as
[1:12:05] Full Gospel people let's mold our
[1:12:10] character he said we're invited to be
[1:12:12] molded into his image that we might
[1:12:14] reflect his
[1:12:17] presence he said and the works that I do
[1:12:20] shall you do also the life that I live
[1:12:22] so shall you we're invited by God to
[1:12:24] take him as an example and let our
[1:12:26] character be molded like his what a
[1:12:28] thing my then when we let his character
[1:12:31] be in us then we have become Sons by the
[1:12:35] by having the mind of Christ mind which
[1:12:37] is his character our mind makes makes
[1:12:40] your Chara your mind makes your
[1:12:41] character let the Mind Paul said of
[1:12:43] Christ this mind that was in Christ be
[1:12:45] in you let that mind of Christ be in you
[1:12:48] it molds the character of a son of
[1:12:52] God
[1:12:54] so you're going to go through these
[1:12:56] things but you know what you're being
[1:12:58] molded by the things you
[1:13:00] suffer see because you understand but
[1:13:02] you're going to be perfected in these
[1:13:04] things and it really struck me when I
[1:13:06] read that he said we're being invited
[1:13:09] and to be to be
[1:13:10] molded see we're not being forced into
[1:13:13] it but we're invited into becoming
[1:13:15] molded Into His Image
[1:13:18] right
[1:13:20] right see it's a great thing it's a
[1:13:23] great daughter to be molded into His
[1:13:24] Image to take on the mind of Christ to
[1:13:27] be molded into that
[1:13:31] image Jesus
[1:13:34] said he said if if I be lifted up right
[1:13:38] he said I'll draw all men to me right
[1:13:40] right see brother says when he's talking
[1:13:43] on that he said it's it's preaching the
[1:13:46] the Simplicity of the Gospel he said
[1:13:48] that will draw the people he said if I
[1:13:51] be lifted up I'll draw all men to me he
[1:13:53] said it's the greatest magnet that the
[1:13:55] world has ever seen right is being is
[1:13:59] seeing Christ in you oh my that's the
[1:14:02] greatest thing see people are looking
[1:14:04] for a Bible he said because brother said
[1:14:07] it's not into Bible We need he said it's
[1:14:09] a
[1:14:11] revelation see what what is a
[1:14:15] revelation I heard brother was speak on
[1:14:17] this one time years ago a revelation is
[1:14:20] a life-changing experience amen
[1:14:24] it changes your life it changes who you
[1:14:27] are see Peter and John they stood there
[1:14:30] and they said we know we know these men
[1:14:31] are ignorant and unlearned they know
[1:14:33] nothing they said we know what they've
[1:14:34] been with Jesus
[1:14:37] right see the ones that when they called
[1:14:39] them Christians he said because they
[1:14:41] acted like Christ he said they
[1:14:42] identified who they were it was a
[1:14:44] life-changing experience when Paul was
[1:14:47] struck down on the road to Damascus and
[1:14:49] he was sit there and he was blinded when
[1:14:51] God was able to speak to him when the
[1:14:53] ones that went out from from their own
[1:14:55] when ananas come and prayed for him and
[1:14:57] the different ones when he went to see
[1:14:58] Peter and the different ones people knew
[1:15:00] that'd been a change in him right right
[1:15:03] he was not the same
[1:15:05] Saul he had the same Zeal but he had the
[1:15:08] Zeal to the Brethren to the word of God
[1:15:11] Amen there in Corinthians when he was
[1:15:13] writing to the to the church at
[1:15:15] Corinthians you know he was telling them
[1:15:16] of the times he said you know I've been
[1:15:18] I've been Shipwrecked and I've been
[1:15:20] beaten right he said a day and the night
[1:15:22] I've spent in the de
[1:15:26] you know it wasn't it wasn't a whole lot
[1:15:27] of fun when you s and read about those
[1:15:29] things beaten and stoned that's
[1:15:32] right he said in all the perils that
[1:15:35] they've been in all the perils that he
[1:15:37] had to go through CU he had a desire to
[1:15:40] see the word of God being taken to the
[1:15:43] Brethren to the churches he's saying
[1:15:45] that people grow in the
[1:15:51] word Lord
[1:15:53] that's right said it's the greatest
[1:15:56] magnet we've
[1:16:03] had this is from the message
[1:16:06] Abraham
[1:16:09] 1955
[1:16:12] brother speaking of
[1:16:15] Abraham
[1:16:17] carrying having to leave his
[1:16:22] family was talking
[1:16:24] about people
[1:16:27] today he said now separate yourself from
[1:16:29] among your people that's best way to do
[1:16:31] it come out from among it get away from
[1:16:34] it someone said well I still go to the
[1:16:36] pool room I think maybe I could win some
[1:16:39] of the boys he said stay out of the pole
[1:16:41] room stay out of stay off the Devil's
[1:16:43] Ground that's right he said you'll never
[1:16:45] do it that way separate yourself and
[1:16:47] show your color be a Christian act like
[1:16:50] it live like it talk like it people will
[1:16:53] believe it no that Jesus said if I be
[1:16:56] lifted up I'll draw all men to me lift
[1:16:58] him up in your life in your living what
[1:17:00] you do right he said you're not going to
[1:17:02] get people because you can't get on
[1:17:04] Satan's battlegr you can't get on
[1:17:06] Satan's ground and get anything done
[1:17:08] that's right and the thing lots of times
[1:17:10] the way we get on on his ground is we
[1:17:12] run our mouths that's right why because
[1:17:15] we talk the devil's language we say what
[1:17:17] devil what the devil wants us to say
[1:17:19] Amen we just start having a pity party
[1:17:22] oh that's good that's good that's good
[1:17:23] keep on doing that
[1:17:26] yeah see but that's not what what he
[1:17:28] wants us to do we need to say what he
[1:17:30] said what God Said what God said about
[1:17:33] us yes Lord I wrote a little something
[1:17:39] here y just forgive me
[1:17:44] about I don't be shocked and this this
[1:17:48] something that's really stood out to me
[1:17:50] don't be shocked when when people pray
[1:17:52] and ask God God for something and it get
[1:17:55] and it happens and people are
[1:17:59] shocked people in this church things
[1:18:01] have been prayed over and people act
[1:18:04] like they're shocked when things
[1:18:07] happen what kind of what kind of
[1:18:09] expectation is
[1:18:10] that you know there's there's something
[1:18:13] else and y'all just pray for me but you
[1:18:14] know it's been it's been I don't know
[1:18:16] how many years ago but you know we
[1:18:18] prayed over loved ones in this in this
[1:18:20] church people that had loved ones that
[1:18:21] were away and you know we were claiming
[1:18:24] our our loved ones and we're praying
[1:18:25] over them and we believe God's bringing
[1:18:27] them in is that just
[1:18:31] words because see the thing what comes
[1:18:33] out of your mouth is what's defeating
[1:18:36] you because you're confing the wrong the
[1:18:39] wrong confession you're making the wrong
[1:18:41] confession
[1:18:47] Y and I
[1:18:49] see just just a a one that one that
[1:18:52] stands out to me
[1:18:53] and his brother
[1:18:54] Benny you know brother Benny's been
[1:18:56] coming you know for a long time you know
[1:18:59] he
[1:19:02] was I guess he was discouraged or
[1:19:05] whatever but you know what we still
[1:19:07] prayed for him
[1:19:09] amen I've known him for a long
[1:19:11] time and you know what it it Thrills me
[1:19:14] to see him in church
[1:19:16] right you know I mean he went he went
[1:19:19] through a lot of hard things but you
[1:19:20] know what God bringing back to bring you
[1:19:23] back to church where he's sitting here
[1:19:26] see I see I see that as as a as a prayer
[1:19:28] oh
[1:19:30] answer I see that as a miracle right
[1:19:34] well because a lot of people we just
[1:19:35] want to write people off but I don't
[1:19:37] write people
[1:19:39] offen
[1:19:40] right and want and I think of sister
[1:19:44] Regina being gone for so long and and
[1:19:46] and being back with us right but there's
[1:19:49] another one I want to say tonight and I
[1:19:51] don't I don't want to offend anybody I
[1:19:52] don't want but there's one other person
[1:19:54] that me and D was talking about this the
[1:19:56] other day that really that's really
[1:19:57] stuck with me for a while and that was
[1:19:59] brother Ryan and sister Gabby coming
[1:20:06] back and I mean it's not and it's and
[1:20:09] and it's
[1:20:11] not one against the other that's right
[1:20:15] but let me tell you
[1:20:18] something I've been in this and and
[1:20:20] people that BL that come to this church
[1:20:25] and you know and I didn't I didn't say
[1:20:27] anything about it for a long time I just
[1:20:29] held my peace but I'm going to say
[1:20:31] something tonight because I want you to
[1:20:32] understand something yes Lord I've heard
[1:20:35] people that come to this church make
[1:20:37] comments about Ryan and
[1:20:39] Gabby about them not you know well I
[1:20:42] guess they'll never come back or
[1:20:43] anything like that see that's the wrong
[1:20:44] kind of confession right if you ain't
[1:20:47] done nothing good to say don't say
[1:20:49] nothing at all that's right that's right
[1:20:51] right well people just well they they
[1:20:54] never make it back they just
[1:20:56] they you know God never told me that
[1:20:59] they were coming back but you know what
[1:21:00] I never could say that he was gone that
[1:21:02] they were gone that they would never
[1:21:04] come
[1:21:05] back and you know because the one thing
[1:21:08] about it God God is Not glorified in
[1:21:12] confusion God's not glorified in fear
[1:21:14] come on
[1:21:17] exact but see the thing is when you when
[1:21:19] you walk before God and you you trust in
[1:21:22] God then you he'll bring you to where
[1:21:23] you need to
[1:21:27] be see it's what what's your confession
[1:21:31] that's
[1:21:32] it see the thing is all of us we say we
[1:21:36] say we all believe we're all trusting
[1:21:38] for one another but sometimes our mouth
[1:21:40] gets us in trouble
[1:21:42] right because we're saying we're saying
[1:21:45] things that we shouldn't be saying
[1:21:46] that's
[1:21:50] right and I know they didn't they want
[1:21:52] to expecting that
[1:21:55] tonight but you know that's something
[1:21:57] that's stirred me right why because you
[1:21:59] know what we're in a battle we've been
[1:22:02] called to a battle and that's one thing
[1:22:03] I've been saying all night
[1:22:05] long see we have the promises of God
[1:22:08] you're in a battle that's right you're
[1:22:10] going to have hard times you know what
[1:22:13] it's it's not going to be
[1:22:14] fun but you know what you don't lean on
[1:22:17] the flesh the flesh will fail you but
[1:22:20] there's something that's inside of you
[1:22:22] that'll car you
[1:22:25] right just like the just like the poem
[1:22:27] about the the man that saw the footsteps
[1:22:30] he said it was him and the Lord and he
[1:22:31] said Lord why is it went through my hard
[1:22:32] times he said I only see one foot one
[1:22:34] set of footprints he said I was carrying
[1:22:36] you during those times that's right see
[1:22:39] what what God has called us to God's
[1:22:41] bringing us to these things see the
[1:22:43] thing is we need when we believe when we
[1:22:46] say we believe we need to have an
[1:22:49] expectation sometimes I want what is
[1:22:51] your expectation
[1:22:54] right you got to have an expectation
[1:22:56] because if you don't expect nothing you
[1:22:58] don't get
[1:23:00] nothing if you don't look for nothing
[1:23:02] you don't get
[1:23:11] nothing I'm going to finish here in a
[1:23:13] minute I just got a couple of things I
[1:23:15] want to read what quick and I'm
[1:23:19] finish this is from the SM Church h
[1:23:23] brother BR says this from the church age
[1:23:26] book he said is it not is it strange
[1:23:29] that God wants us to develop a
[1:23:30] Christlike character that comes through
[1:23:32] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:23:35] we all we are all tried and chastened as
[1:23:37] Sons no no one but what goes through
[1:23:41] that the church that is not suffering
[1:23:44] that is not being tried isn't of God for
[1:23:47] whom the Lord loveth he Chase scourges
[1:23:49] every son whom he receiveth if he
[1:23:52] without CH chastisement whereof all our
[1:23:56] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:23:59] Sons then continuing on he says we need
[1:24:01] the Lord to teach us the truth that we
[1:24:04] are to suffer and be Christlike in doing
[1:24:10] it he said love suffereth long and is
[1:24:13] kind Matthew 5112 says blessed are ye
[1:24:16] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:24:18] you and say all manner of evil against
[1:24:19] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:24:21] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[1:24:23] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[1:24:25] prophets that were before
[1:24:27] you he continues on he said the the
[1:24:30] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:24:32] signs of God's disapproval neither are
[1:24:34] the bright skies and Still Waters signs
[1:24:37] of his love and approval his approval of
[1:24:40] any of us is only in the Beloved his
[1:24:42] love is elective which he had for us
[1:24:45] before the foundation of the world does
[1:24:47] he love us oh yes but how shall we know
[1:24:50] how shall we know because he said so and
[1:24:53] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:24:56] brought us to himself and gave us his
[1:24:58] Spirit placing us as sons and how shall
[1:25:01] I prove my love to him by believing what
[1:25:04] he said and by conducting myself with
[1:25:07] joy amidst the trials that in his wisdom
[1:25:11] allows allows to come to pass
[1:25:15] am that's my love for him that I should
[1:25:19] have
[1:25:20] joy and this is this is a quote that I
[1:25:23] want to
[1:25:24] read this is what I was telling brother
[1:25:28] R sister Gail about this is from letting
[1:25:30] off the
[1:25:30] pressure and brother says I met a woman
[1:25:34] here some time ago in a 10 cent store
[1:25:36] she was about 60 years old looked about
[1:25:38] 30 years old and I said well how do you
[1:25:40] do sister she said brother brandom I've
[1:25:41] got two sons that's doctors that are
[1:25:43] older than you are and honest to
[1:25:45] goodness she didn't look over 30 years
[1:25:46] old and said here's what it was when I
[1:25:48] come to Christ when I was about 12 years
[1:25:50] old I sat down and thought about it
[1:25:51] studied religions but when I found the
[1:25:54] true one she said I come to Christ and
[1:25:55] took my case my soul all all to him and
[1:25:58] said I've never had a worry sense now he
[1:26:01] promised to take care of all my troubles
[1:26:03] and said if he's not big enough to do it
[1:26:05] I know I'm not big enough to do it so
[1:26:07] there's what's the use of me worrying
[1:26:08] about it see that's it God promises that
[1:26:11] he would take all your cares cast your
[1:26:13] cares on him so you what are you
[1:26:15] worrying
[1:26:19] about that's right see what he said that
[1:26:23] she was so she was so happy she was so
[1:26:26] young looking why because she realized
[1:26:29] if God couldn't take care of there
[1:26:30] nobody worrying about it but he said he
[1:26:32] would take care of it so we just turn it
[1:26:35] over to him
[1:26:36] right and now the LA last one this is
[1:26:39] from the perg church
[1:26:40] age he said and then this word he has
[1:26:44] left behind on the printed page is a
[1:26:46] part of him when you accept it by faith
[1:26:49] into a Spirit-filled life he said that
[1:26:51] his word word was
[1:26:53] life he said he said that I am the way
[1:26:56] the truth and the life if any man have
[1:26:58] not the spirit of Christ he n is is is
[1:27:00] there it is he is spirit and he is life
[1:27:02] that's exactly what the word is that is
[1:27:04] exactly what Jesus is he is the word he
[1:27:07] said so in a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:27:09] man in faith takes the word into his
[1:27:11] heart and places it upon his lips why
[1:27:13] it's the same as deity speaking right he
[1:27:15] said Every Mountain has to go Satan
[1:27:17] cannot stand before that
[1:27:21] man
[1:27:24] so that's
[1:27:26] that's what it is to
[1:27:31] us said Satan cannot stand before that
[1:27:36] right so my question
[1:27:40] is are you Spirit born are you spirit
[1:27:45] filled have you taken the word into your
[1:27:48] heart do you confess the word he said
[1:27:52] because if you do that he said it's the
[1:27:54] same as deity speaking that's right see
[1:27:58] sometimes we and it really struck me
[1:28:00] people people looking they they want God
[1:28:01] to speak to them oh if brother Brandon
[1:28:03] was here to speak the word well guess
[1:28:06] what deity is here speaking amen yes sir
[1:28:10] if you speak it if you're a Son of God
[1:28:12] and you speak the word and believe right
[1:28:14] then it's the same as D speaking it's
[1:28:17] the same because it is him speaking
[1:28:19] amen so when you speak it then you
[1:28:22] believe what you say brother Bram said
[1:28:24] that Jesus walked in a realm of perfect
[1:28:26] Faith because he knew what who he was
[1:28:28] and he spoke and he walked in that realm
[1:28:30] so when he spoke he said I he said the
[1:28:32] son can do nothing of himself except
[1:28:34] what he see the father do he said that
[1:28:36] doth the son likewise so he walked in a
[1:28:39] realm of perfect Faith so he wasn't
[1:28:41] shocked when things
[1:28:45] happened he was the one you know he was
[1:28:47] the one that he never attended a
[1:28:49] funeral right that's right he never
[1:28:53] attended a funeral why because there was
[1:28:54] never any funeral that he ever went
[1:28:57] to see he had to he had to leave and
[1:28:59] walk away by the musicians come you
[1:29:03] stand I'm running out of
[1:29:05] time but
[1:29:09] ra
[1:29:11] when you know he had to he had to leave
[1:29:14] and he said he had to wait leave from uh
[1:29:17] Lazarus to pass
[1:29:20] right he said sleeps they said well he
[1:29:23] does he does
[1:29:25] well then he told him he said no Lazarus
[1:29:27] is
[1:29:32] dead but he knew he had to wait for
[1:29:34] Lazarus to pass so that he could go
[1:29:37] raise him up
[1:29:40] right so he wasn't concerned about what
[1:29:42] was going to take
[1:29:44] place and it's the same with you and I
[1:29:47] right if if we are who we say we are
[1:29:50] come on
[1:29:53] and he said that woman had had all that
[1:29:55] money and and all those things in her
[1:29:57] Bible it said right there and they were
[1:30:00] just pretty pictures to
[1:30:03] her and you know what you you've been
[1:30:05] you've been equipped all that you have
[1:30:08] need of has been given to you so if if
[1:30:11] you've been equipped with all that you
[1:30:13] have need
[1:30:15] of and that's yours then guess what if
[1:30:18] we don't if we don't claim ours then
[1:30:20] it's nobody's fault but ours
[1:30:22] right God can't do anym for
[1:30:25] us how many times did Brother vom tell
[1:30:27] him in the prayer lines when he stood
[1:30:29] there he said if Jesus was here tonight
[1:30:31] he said he couldn't do any more for you
[1:30:34] that's right you ask him to heal you he
[1:30:36] said I can't heal you he said you're
[1:30:38] already healed he said I've already done
[1:30:40] it
[1:30:41] right you know Isaiah 53:5 says we are
[1:30:45] healed amen by his stripes we are healed
[1:30:47] that's right we are healed first Peter
[1:30:49] 2:24 says by his stripes we were he
[1:30:51] healed past
[1:30:54] tense see it was already finished so he
[1:30:57] can't do any more for us than what he's
[1:30:59] already
[1:31:00] done but you've got to take him at his
[1:31:02] word on and that's what God wants us to
[1:31:05] do because the promises of God are yay
[1:31:07] and amen and they're given to us but we
[1:31:09] have to accept them God can't do any
[1:31:11] more for us than he's already
[1:31:14] done but he said he lead you and guide
[1:31:16] you he take care of you but You' got to
[1:31:18] accept him amen God bless you brother

[1:40:19] I
[1:40:35] amen amen
[1:40:38] amen I
[1:40:40] say was an old song years ago and it
[1:40:44] says that you're supposed to write down
[1:40:47] a piece of paper says write down all
[1:40:49] your troubles on one side and all your
[1:40:51] blessings on the other he said you'll
[1:40:53] find that all your blessings outnumber
[1:40:55] your troubles every time amen that's
[1:40:58] right because that's what happens you're
[1:41:01] you'll find out you're more blessed than
[1:41:02] you've got
[1:41:03] troubles and All the Troubles you've got
[1:41:06] they come work out for your good right
[1:41:09] there something good out of your
[1:41:11] troubles amen it's all hearts and Minds
[1:41:14] clear before we go this
[1:41:17] evening can I come say sure
[1:41:24] I didn't know what brother Aron was
[1:41:25] going to preach tonight but before the
[1:41:27] service I was just thinking about how
[1:41:29] thankful I am that uh that God brought
[1:41:33] us back
[1:41:41] and thank you Jesus thank you Father so
[1:41:45] L Hallelujah um you know me and Gabby
[1:41:49] were just divided on two doctrines over
[1:41:52] these
[1:41:53] years and
[1:41:55] uh and it just felt we were so one
[1:41:58] except for just those two things you
[1:42:00] know we just couldn't get together on
[1:42:01] those two doctrines we' talk about the
[1:42:03] word and talk about the message and when
[1:42:05] it come down to those two things we just
[1:42:07] couldn't see how eyes so we just
[1:42:08] wouldn't touch on it but we prayed and I
[1:42:10] prayed and the Lord began to deal with
[1:42:13] both of us and open our eyes about that
[1:42:14] but I wanted to say the Lord laid
[1:42:17] brother Mark on my heart right before
[1:42:19] the service and like I said I didn't
[1:42:21] know what brother Aron was going to
[1:42:22] preach but brother Mark's been coming so
[1:42:24] faithful and I know he wants his wife
[1:42:27] here and so uh shame on me for not
[1:42:30] praying for him I just never even
[1:42:32] thought about him but about that but uh
[1:42:35] U just say we should have brother Mark
[1:42:38] on our on our our hearts and and be
[1:42:40] praying for him and so many others
[1:42:42] because the truth brings division it
[1:42:44] really does and this message in general
[1:42:45] brings division between people and a lot
[1:42:48] of times and so just uphold one another
[1:42:50] you know and I think thank youall so
[1:42:51] much for your prayers that means amen
[1:42:59] thank brother Aon it's strange that he
[1:43:02] would say that because I was thinking
[1:43:04] about his wife too a few minutes ago and
[1:43:07] I thought she's so beautiful on the
[1:43:09] outside and I'm sure she's beautiful on
[1:43:11] the inside but Lord just you know bring
[1:43:14] her with for the mar it's funny that we
[1:43:16] both it's not funny that that he said
[1:43:18] two so there's two of us that was
[1:43:20] thinking the same thing so praise the
[1:43:25] Lord God does does all things in his own
[1:43:29] time that's right that's right we just
[1:43:32] don't try to get ahead of you right amen
[1:43:35] anybody else before we go let's
[1:43:37] say I appreciate all of you I love all
[1:43:39] of
[1:43:42] you we pray guys reading
[1:43:45] next this is what then prayed with both
[1:43:48] hands lifted we pray the see
[1:43:51] raise both hands pray
[1:43:55] amen amen well before we
[1:43:58] go all hearts and Minds clear amen going
[1:44:02] ask brother col if you don't mind to
[1:44:04] dismiss us in a word of prayer let's
[1:44:06] just remember all these different ones
[1:44:07] that have needs ones that are not here
[1:44:09] with
[1:44:11] us doesn't matter how far you go God
[1:44:14] knows where you're at he can bring you
[1:44:16] back that's
[1:44:18] right he say we don't we don't
