[1:03] morning
[1:05] everything's a little bit different this
[1:06] morning
[1:08] come expecting come
[1:10] ready to ready to see something really
[1:12] really great so
[1:14] so glad for all the work that
[1:15] everybody's done to put this together
[1:17] the little skit that we're going to see
[1:18] this morning
[1:19] but this morning um
[1:22] i first of all appreciate brother john i
[1:24] guess he's listening in for for taking
[1:25] the last couple of sunday schools and uh
[1:28] we we had a really good time with all
[1:30] the brothers up and uh all the people up
[1:32] in irwin tennessee with brother andre
[1:34] and all the saints up there
[1:36] um we're just gonna take another little
[1:38] detour uh today from the book of hebrews
[1:41] and and if they're willing to pull that
[1:42] up
[1:43] since we have all of this and everything
[1:45] let's just
[1:46] let's just talk about the birth of
[1:47] christ this morning just for a little
[1:49] sunday school lesson
[1:51] and we'll read matthew chapter 1 verses
[1:53] 18 to 25 and and uh some some of chapter
[1:56] two
[1:57] as well you know most of the time when
[1:59] you if you're sitting around on on
[2:01] christmas day or whatever and you're
[2:02] telling the story of christ you you tend
[2:05] to read more maybe from the book of luke
[2:07] but matthew has
[2:09] some some interesting little nuggets
[2:11] that are not part of that story that he
[2:14] he adds um
[2:16] so you know you got to put them all
[2:17] together put all the all the four
[2:19] gospels together to kind of get the
[2:20] complete picture of everything that
[2:22] happened
[2:23] and
[2:24] so let's read in matthew chapter one it
[2:26] says now the birth of jesus christ was
[2:27] on this wise
[2:29] he said now this is how it happened
[2:32] but as his mother mary was espoused to
[2:34] joseph before they came together she was
[2:35] found with child of the holy ghost
[2:38] then joseph her husband being a just man
[2:41] and not willing to make her a public
[2:42] example was minded to put her away
[2:44] privily
[2:45] but while he thought on these things
[2:48] you think about how many times the
[2:49] scripture talks about people thinking
[2:50] about that i think in hebrews chapter 11
[2:52] there's like three different times that
[2:54] it points out that the people they they
[2:56] thought this is a gospel where we think
[2:58] about things we're not just believing
[3:00] haphazardly but we know what we believe
[3:03] he said while while he thought on these
[3:05] things behold the angel of the lord
[3:06] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[3:08] joseph thou son of david fear not to
[3:10] take unto thee mary thou wife
[3:12] for that which is conceived in her is of
[3:14] the holy ghost
[3:16] he brings out two times already that
[3:18] this is not just a normal birth this
[3:20] child is of the holy ghost
[3:22] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[3:24] shalt call his name jesus
[3:26] for he shall save his people from their
[3:27] sins
[3:29] think how specific the angel was and
[3:31] telling him in this dream how everything
[3:34] even even to how he would be named
[3:37] now all this was done that it might be
[3:39] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[3:40] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[3:42] shall be with a child and shall bring
[3:44] forth a son and they shall call his name
[3:46] immanuel which being interpreted is god
[3:48] with us
[3:50] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[3:52] as the angel of the lord had bitten him
[3:53] and took unto him his wife
[3:55] and knew her not until she had brought
[3:57] forth her firstborn son
[3:59] and he called his name jesus
[4:01] now you notice a lot of this in verse 22
[4:04] you just leave it up there and we'll
[4:06] just we'll just kind of just
[4:08] refer back to the scripture in verse 22
[4:10] it says now all this was done that it
[4:12] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[4:14] the lord by the prophet
[4:15] so everything that's being done here you
[4:18] can just
[4:19] there's so many scriptures that will
[4:20] fulfill all at once all is just kind of
[4:22] a burst here as jesus's birth all of
[4:25] these scriptures so all the things that
[4:27] are happening are or the word being
[4:29] fulfilled
[4:30] and one of the things that's been
[4:31] fulfilled is that you know christ is is
[4:34] is kind of a he's a lamb and so we know
[4:37] we know that that christ wasn't really
[4:39] born in december it's cold outside and
[4:41] we know that he wasn't born this time of
[4:43] year he was born in the spring
[4:45] and it's really important to kind of to
[4:47] get that that that uh
[4:49] to have to have a perfect understanding
[4:51] of the picture
[4:53] so that when you you know you're you're
[4:54] studying the scripture and you're
[4:55] listening to brother branham and preach
[4:57] on why it had to be shepherds
[4:59] you had to be shepherds because
[5:00] shepherds know by sheep
[5:02] and those kind of things you have to
[5:03] know
[5:04] that it wasn't the the time of the year
[5:06] brother ramen and uh
[5:09] in a message he was in and we have seen
[5:11] a star and come to worship him he said
[5:13] christmas is the roman catholic
[5:14] conception of his birth and he said
[5:16] christmas has changed this the way we
[5:18] take christmas if you ever studied it
[5:20] we're taking the roman catholic church's
[5:22] conception of when christmas was
[5:24] and he goes on to talk about christ and
[5:26] could not have been born on the 25th day
[5:27] of november december and so forth and he
[5:29] said he talked about he came like nature
[5:32] nature in in the spring is when
[5:34] everything comes up and that's when
[5:35] christ was born he was born when lambs
[5:38] were born
[5:39] because he was a lamb
[5:41] and you see everything that's happening
[5:43] is to fulfill scripture right
[5:45] it's all it's all fulfilling scripture
[5:47] and verse 22 now all this was done that
[5:49] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[5:51] of the lord by the prophet and a couple
[5:53] of things that are being fulfilled here
[5:54] is in isaiah chapter 7
[5:56] therefore the lord himself shall give
[5:58] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[5:59] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[6:01] his name emmanuel that that prophet
[6:03] isaiah spoke that many hundreds of years
[6:06] before and now people had wondered at
[6:08] that and now right before their eyes
[6:11] even though many in the world did not
[6:12] wreck it most in the world did not
[6:13] recognize it now god was being
[6:15] manifested in flesh
[6:18] that's maybe that's maybe the point of
[6:20] the christmas story what were the magi
[6:22] looking for
[6:23] christ in flesh
[6:25] what was the shepherds looking for
[6:26] christ in flesh amen
[6:28] and now and if you go to matthew chapter
[6:30] 2 scroll down to matthew chapter 2 verse
[6:32] 16 and we'll we're going to be scrolling
[6:34] up and down uh uh uh maybe a little bit
[6:38] or because in in verse 18 it talks about
[6:41] that that the fulfillment of another
[6:43] scripture and rama was their voice heard
[6:45] lamentation and weeping and great
[6:47] mourning rachel weeping for her children
[6:49] and would not be comforted because they
[6:50] are not and matthew says that that
[6:52] scripture was fulfilled when herron had
[6:54] all the all the kids
[6:56] sling he slew all the kids when the
[6:58] magic came and said we've been traveling
[6:59] for two years
[7:01] and so he said well let's look let's
[7:02] kill all the all the kids two years and
[7:04] under because i don't want anybody else
[7:05] to be king i get nervous when somebody
[7:07] says somebody's gonna be king
[7:09] so here it had all the kids slow now
[7:11] what what does that mean what that
[7:12] there's another scripture being
[7:13] fulfilled
[7:14] that's the scripture that jeremiah
[7:16] prophesied of in jeremiah 31
[7:19] 15 thus saith the lord a voice was heard
[7:21] in rama lamentation and bitter weeping
[7:24] rahel weeping for her children refused
[7:26] to be comforted for her children because
[7:28] they were not
[7:29] now now to really understand that
[7:31] scripture you got to go back rachel died
[7:33] when she was giving birth to benjamin
[7:35] and where did she die she was about a
[7:37] mile outside of the city of bethlehem
[7:40] and she was on the way back to bethlehem
[7:42] when she went into labor
[7:44] so now there's a pit story of somebody
[7:46] in labor in bethlehem
[7:48] now we've got another story of a little
[7:51] woman coming into bethlehem and labor
[7:53] and rachel was in lamentation dying
[7:56] there on the side of the road and she as
[7:57] she was in labor and she gave birth
[7:59] and and so in genesis we've got a story
[8:01] of rachel
[8:03] dying giving birth on the road to
[8:04] bethlehem
[8:05] and in the midst of her suffering the
[8:07] midwife is trying to comfort her with
[8:08] the news that she's having a son you
[8:10] think about how all all in scripture
[8:12] you've got that pattern repeated of
[8:14] there's there's sorrow and then birth
[8:16] there's a there's
[8:17] dying and then restoration and so what's
[8:20] happening here is the scriptures being
[8:21] fulfilled and
[8:23] there's a there's a story of lamentation
[8:25] and sorrow but the savior of the world
[8:27] is being born
[8:28] now in jeremiah
[8:30] rachel you could say rachel was weeping
[8:32] as they were led out of the out of out
[8:34] of the city going off into babylon into
[8:37] captivity but they had a promise that in
[8:39] 70 years they would be returned they
[8:41] would return back because you know
[8:43] there's that same pattern being repeated
[8:45] sorrow and then hope sorrow and then
[8:48] birth and now in matthew's day
[8:51] rachel's weeping again this time over
[8:53] the slaughter of all the children of
[8:54] bethlehem
[8:56] but but in the midst of all that sorrow
[8:58] there's a child being born now you see
[9:01] how that echoes when john in john
[9:03] chapter 16 he said when a woman when a
[9:05] woman when she is in travail have sorrow
[9:07] because her hour has come
[9:09] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[9:11] child she remembereth no more the
[9:13] anguish
[9:14] for joy that a man is born into the
[9:16] world
[9:17] now here we've got the man christ jesus
[9:19] being born in the midst of all this
[9:21] sorrow and so that's what it means when
[9:22] it says and rama rama rama was that
[9:25] little place right outside of bethlehem
[9:27] and rama was there a voice heard
[9:29] lamentation and weeping and great
[9:31] mourning rachel weeping for her children
[9:34] and would not be comforted because they
[9:36] are not
[9:38] so his birth was fulfilling scripture
[9:41] another scripture was that he had to be
[9:42] born in bethlehem because in micah
[9:44] chapter 5 it says but thou
[9:46] bethlehem a fraud of thou that thou be
[9:48] little among the thousands of judah yet
[9:50] out of these shall he come forth unto me
[9:52] that is to be ruler in israel and you
[9:54] think about in the midst of all this
[9:55] sorrow and turmoil that that that god
[9:58] was actually aligning everything so that
[10:00] they would they would actually wind up
[10:01] in
[10:02] in bethlehem now the romans conducted a
[10:04] census every five years to kind of keep
[10:06] track of how many people there were and
[10:08] so they could tax people appropriately
[10:11] and they called every every man and his
[10:13] family to go back to their place of
[10:14] birth so they could count everybody and
[10:16] make sure they had a good tally of
[10:18] course it was really easy with the jews
[10:19] because the jews were really good at
[10:21] keeping keeping
[10:23] their ancestry they kept really good
[10:25] records of where they came from and so
[10:27] that's why joseph and mary went back to
[10:29] bethlehem because joseph was of the
[10:31] house of david
[10:32] and so david david was from bethlehem so
[10:35] they went back to bethlehem because
[10:36] that's where his front he was from
[10:38] so that he could be counted so the
[10:40] romans could get their taxes
[10:43] and that that forced them to go back to
[10:45] bethlehem so that they were going on
[10:46] this long
[10:48] difficult journey a long journey
[10:51] so the scripture could be fulfilled
[10:53] now you think about everybody in
[10:54] scripture going on a long journey
[10:56] abraham went on a long journey ruth went
[10:57] on a long journey
[10:59] you're going on a long journey and the
[11:01] whole purpose is so that scripture could
[11:02] be fulfilled and what was the purpose of
[11:04] this story was to see christ manifested
[11:08] in flesh
[11:10] now brother ramsey said that it looks
[11:11] like a horrible thing that poor little
[11:12] woman in that place that she was in
[11:15] heavy with child and would have to take
[11:17] that long journey he said today we would
[11:19] hardly think of of putting her in an
[11:21] ambulance if he was ever in palestine
[11:23] and see where she had to come through
[11:24] that rugged granite boulders
[11:26] up through there on the back of a little
[11:28] mule
[11:29] no matter how bad it was
[11:31] and how cruel it seemed
[11:34] that was the king's orders everybody
[11:36] must do it young or old prepared or not
[11:39] prepared they had to do it anyhow you
[11:42] had to go back to your place of birth to
[11:44] your church to to the place of your your
[11:46] ancestors to the place of your family
[11:49] you had to do it we we think so many
[11:51] times in our life it's hard it's hard to
[11:52] deal with without air conditioner it's
[11:54] hard to do without without heating or
[11:56] just different conveniences of life but
[11:59] they
[12:00] they had to do it they had she had even
[12:02] though she was in labor
[12:04] getting to that time of life you you uh
[12:07] think about sometimes
[12:09] sisters in labor today it's it's hard to
[12:11] drive on a long journey but she had to
[12:12] get on the back of that little mule and
[12:14] brother brown said it might seem strange
[12:16] but it was all working together good
[12:19] when whenever sometimes rough spots in
[12:22] life hit us and we're going through a
[12:23] little rough time
[12:25] god might be working out something in
[12:26] your life
[12:28] and and he said in this sermon he said
[12:29] now
[12:31] mary mary said
[12:33] he was painting mary as a real optimist
[12:36] he's his painter is like somebody that
[12:37] that she was going through a rough spot
[12:39] but it didn't matter to her he said now
[12:41] joseph she said now joseph dear
[12:43] no matter what takes place
[12:46] and what the king says i am able he said
[12:49] that's what mary said
[12:50] i'm able
[12:52] i can set up on the little mule
[12:55] it's several miles up around these rocky
[12:57] mountains and so forth
[12:59] if we need if we happen to need a little
[13:01] help there'll be many in the journey
[13:03] because we're not the only family you
[13:05] think about that
[13:07] sitting here this morning there's a lot
[13:08] of people in the journey and we we help
[13:10] one another there's a lot of people on
[13:11] the road there was a lot of people then
[13:13] that that had to go back to their to
[13:15] their to to the city of bethlehem or
[13:17] wherever they were from
[13:19] because of what the romans had done
[13:22] and she said there's others that suffer
[13:23] the same thing we have so there's others
[13:25] along the road
[13:27] and all that grief and all that
[13:28] suffering was so that the word of god
[13:30] can be fulfilled
[13:32] so in matthew chapter 1 verse 18 it says
[13:35] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[13:37] this wise when as his mother mary was
[13:40] espoused to joseph before they came
[13:41] together she was found with child of the
[13:43] holy ghost
[13:44] then joseph her husband being a just man
[13:47] and not willing to make her a public
[13:48] example was minded to put her away
[13:50] privily now you think about all the
[13:52] grief that that little girl had to go
[13:54] through
[13:55] all the
[13:56] you know just like
[13:58] in many ways just like a lot of the
[14:00] suffering and things that you go through
[14:01] when you're being a christian example
[14:03] and at your work or in walmart or
[14:05] wherever you go and people look at you
[14:07] strange where people are people were
[14:08] certainly looking at her strange because
[14:10] they didn't understand how she could
[14:12] have a child without with without
[14:14] knowing a man
[14:16] all that humiliation and weariness and
[14:18] stress and god in his providence he he
[14:21] married her to him he allowed her to be
[14:23] married to a man that wasn't just some
[14:24] little uh uh
[14:26] some little young that that was
[14:29] you know brother brown said that he was
[14:30] joseph was about 45 years old when he
[14:32] got married and he already had four kids
[14:34] so he was a man with experience in some
[14:36] things his wife his first wife had
[14:38] already died he was a widower so he
[14:40] married this little girl and he he
[14:41] wasn't he wasn't so called up and just
[14:44] just youth and everything he was called
[14:45] up and he he
[14:46] he was a mature man
[14:48] that that
[14:50] uh
[14:51] knew how to handle things new knew what
[14:53] to be concerned with a mature man that
[14:55] when they got to bethlehem he was he was
[14:57] thinking right about i got to find a
[14:59] place for this little girl to have to
[15:01] for my wife to have a baby
[15:03] and and you think about think about the
[15:06] uh brother brown lays out all the uh the
[15:08] mental uh battle that joseph went
[15:11] through when first you know she she told
[15:14] him i'm i'm gonna have a baby you think
[15:16] about that now
[15:18] that just just
[15:19] imagine what how these things would have
[15:21] played out that that he would
[15:25] we read it a lot of times in the bible
[15:27] is just a story but these are real
[15:29] people that went through real battles
[15:30] and and for him you know when she told
[15:33] us
[15:34] brother-in-law said she she must have
[15:35] told him
[15:37] joseph going with her noticed this no
[15:39] doubt after he was espoused to her no he
[15:41] found out that she was to be mother now
[15:43] he was a just man the bible said he was
[15:45] she must have told him of her innocence
[15:48] and she must have told him of the visit
[15:50] with her and the great archangel that
[15:52] the archangel had come to her gabriel
[15:54] and had visited her with these great
[15:56] signs that he had told her about that
[15:57] what was going to happen
[15:59] think about how joseph's reaction to
[16:01] that that you're going to have a child
[16:02] without knowing any man and an angel
[16:04] told you told mary is what
[16:07] my that that what a mind battle so
[16:10] joseph began he began to wonder now now
[16:12] if she don't have somebody to to be a
[16:14] shield for her
[16:15] she's she's going to be she's going to
[16:17] be stoned she's going to die
[16:19] so to joseph it seemed that mary was
[16:21] trying to get him to be her shield from
[16:23] all the scoffers and scorners
[16:26] you think about that pattern but brother
[16:28] brown's comparing that to
[16:30] the the experience that joseph's going
[16:32] through to almost like being a christian
[16:34] because before you become a christian
[16:36] you're not willing to be a shield for
[16:37] christ you're not willing to to accept
[16:40] all the humiliation and scorn
[16:42] but but after you become a christian
[16:44] after you get the baptism in the holy
[16:45] ghost you're where you're ready to let
[16:46] anybody say whatever because you know
[16:48] whom you believe you you've got you've
[16:51] got a revelation of what you're doing
[16:53] here
[16:54] and so
[16:55] in verse 20 it says while he thought on
[16:58] these things while he thought he was he
[17:00] wasn't just taking it haphazardly but he
[17:02] was really thinking about it
[17:05] while he thought on these things the
[17:07] angel of the lord appeared unto him in a
[17:09] dream
[17:10] saying joseph thou son of david
[17:12] fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife
[17:16] for that which is conceived in hers of
[17:18] the holy ghost
[17:19] now you know you know dreams can be a
[17:21] little bit dangerous because you know
[17:23] brother brown actually in this sermon
[17:24] he's laying out how how dreams
[17:27] you you might eat a lot of spaghetti and
[17:29] go to bed and get a dream and it you
[17:31] might dream about being drowning or
[17:32] flying or all kinds of things that are
[17:34] in symbol but notice how the angel
[17:37] talked to joseph it was very specific
[17:41] he didn't need anybody to interpret it
[17:44] when you have a dream when god gives you
[17:45] a dream that's not in symbol
[17:47] it's not in something where you got to
[17:49] go ask somebody uh what do you think
[17:51] this means
[17:52] you it's something that you can rest on
[17:55] this dream was very specific he told
[17:58] joseph how the baby was going to be born
[18:01] what his name was going to be he laid
[18:03] out everything about the scenario
[18:07] so brother brown said he pondered on the
[18:09] things it was so unusual he could hardly
[18:12] comprehend that how could those things
[18:14] be but he no doubt
[18:15] see now that the example that he's
[18:18] trying to lay out is just like the
[18:20] gospel
[18:20] people ponder is is the could this
[18:23] message really be true
[18:25] could could god have really sent a
[18:27] prophet in this age what what if it is
[18:30] true
[18:31] what if malachi 4 5 6 really is true
[18:35] and he pondered on those things he was
[18:37] pondering on the on this new thing for
[18:40] that day just as many pondered today
[18:43] and he said while he was studying the
[18:45] angel of the lord appeared to him
[18:47] in a dream
[18:48] while he was studying
[18:50] because he he was serious about it he
[18:52] got desperate he wanted to know the
[18:53] answer he wasn't just
[18:55] like to we'll put it in today's term he
[18:57] wasn't just watching tv
[18:59] but he was studying
[19:02] so the dream
[19:04] the dream settled the issue for joseph
[19:07] and after he had the dream
[19:09] he was happy to be mary's shield
[19:12] and brother ram said when a man can be
[19:13] revealed that jesus christ is the same
[19:16] yesterday today and forever
[19:18] nobody no matter how many creeds try to
[19:20] turn it back you're glad to be a shield
[19:23] you're happy to be a shield
[19:25] let them say whatever you get you got a
[19:27] big shield up there to knock the fiery
[19:29] darts off
[19:31] you're happy to be a shield
[19:34] so they got up and he he talked about
[19:36] how they they loaded up that little
[19:38] donkey and fed him an extra bunch of hay
[19:41] and some oats and because because you
[19:42] know she's pregnant she was real heavy
[19:44] and they loaded her up and they went
[19:45] down to staggering and falling and
[19:49] pulling over to the side to get some
[19:50] rest every once in a while and moving
[19:52] real slow because she was she was
[19:54] pregnant and they had to take care and
[19:55] they and and it began to move on down
[19:58] into bethlehem and he said finally it
[20:00] began to get dark
[20:03] travelers along the road much more able
[20:05] to travel faster and they come on by
[20:08] and she had to breathe the dust of the
[20:10] rest of them upon horses and carriages
[20:12] and so forth
[20:14] they could go over it because she had to
[20:16] travel real slow on the account of her
[20:18] condition
[20:19] a cruel thing to send that mother up
[20:22] there in that condition
[20:24] but i can just imagine now in the little
[20:27] drama
[20:28] as they come up to the top of the hill
[20:31] now you think picture that in your mind
[20:33] coming up to the top of the hill and
[20:35] you know if you look at pictures of
[20:36] bethlehem that they're they're not great
[20:38] big mountains it's just kind of little
[20:40] rolling hills and they come up to the
[20:41] top of that hill and down at the bottom
[20:43] of the valley you can see bethlehem as
[20:45] they come up
[20:47] and bethlehem he said bethlehem sets in
[20:48] kind of like a little valley on the west
[20:50] side of the mountain of bethlehem
[20:52] the mountain where the little trail
[20:53] comes up
[20:55] so you you think about them laboring in
[20:57] that condition coming up over the hill
[20:59] and it's getting dark and he said the
[21:01] stars began to come out
[21:03] the stars began to come out
[21:06] he said after a while he come up to the
[21:07] top of the hill and he began to think
[21:09] what will i do
[21:11] if i can't find a place
[21:13] because that baby might be born tonight
[21:16] she's been in pain all day
[21:18] so now what if that baby is to be born
[21:21] tonight
[21:22] you think about us a man that has gone
[21:24] through situations where we got to get
[21:25] our wife to the hospital real quick
[21:28] you got to hurry you got you you can't
[21:30] wait you you that baby's coming and
[21:32] think of him going going over the city
[21:34] it's getting dark and they got to find a
[21:35] place to stay and it wasn't a place
[21:37] where there was no hospitals or
[21:39] ambulances he's got he's got a they
[21:41] can't have this baby on the side of the
[21:42] road with all these robbers and thieves
[21:44] and and strange people on the on the
[21:47] road traveling
[21:49] they got to find he it's an emergency
[21:51] he's got to find somebody
[21:53] some some place to to have this child
[21:56] but they were looking down that valley
[21:57] and he looked over there and they looked
[21:59] as it's getting dark and it and brother
[22:01] he explains that he looked over there
[22:04] and he saw a star
[22:06] he had never remember seeing one so big
[22:09] it looks so low
[22:12] and it was hanging right over bethlehem
[22:15] he looked up and he turned and he after
[22:17] he helped mary up on a rock to rest a
[22:18] little while he turned around to see it
[22:20] say to say to her dear did you ever
[22:23] notice
[22:24] and he could even see its reflection in
[22:26] her pretty black eyes as she sat and
[22:28] looked saying smile and said dear
[22:30] isn't that strange
[22:33] she said joseph honey i have watched
[22:35] that since the sun went down
[22:37] i've been watching that star
[22:40] somehow or another i feel real strange
[22:42] tonight that something is fixing to
[22:44] happen
[22:45] well it's usually that way you know you
[22:47] have that strange feeling and she began
[22:49] to watch the star and joseph the little
[22:52] mule taking his rest breathing and they
[22:54] watched the star
[22:55] and had an odd action to it it didn't
[22:57] act like the rest of the stars
[22:59] it seemed to be restless moving
[23:01] it was waiting for something
[23:03] watching for something to happen
[23:06] now let's leave our little couple
[23:08] sitting here on this rock
[23:10] for a minute you you know you notice how
[23:12] brother brown painted that scripture
[23:13] that was a that was a supernatural star
[23:16] and and later on he compares it to the
[23:18] to the light that paul saw on the road
[23:20] on the road there when he when he fell
[23:22] on the dirt he compares it
[23:24] he compares it to all these scriptural
[23:27] vindications of something supernatural
[23:29] happening and that we're now following
[23:31] that same light
[23:33] where
[23:33] to see christ manifest in flesh
[23:38] so he said let's go in our minds and we
[23:40] got just a few more minutes and we'll
[23:41] close on this let's go in our minds and
[23:43] go way
[23:44] hundreds of miles way into the east the
[23:46] magi the magi we're up on a tower
[23:49] looking the magi were um
[23:52] uh
[23:53] the medes and the persians had had
[23:55] conquered uh all the way over into iraq
[23:57] and
[23:58] pakistan and
[24:00] iran and way over over to into the
[24:02] western part of india so the magi had
[24:05] had fallen the magi if you go read the
[24:08] book of daniel
[24:09] the book of daniel refers to them as
[24:11] wise men
[24:12] that's what magi were and magi was kind
[24:14] of a a a term that referred to any any
[24:18] wise any teacher priest physician
[24:20] astrologer see your interpreter of
[24:21] dreams augers soothsayers these were
[24:24] people that were concerned about the
[24:26] supernatural so they climbed up in their
[24:28] tower and they and they were every night
[24:30] they would look at the stars and that
[24:31] was their bible and they could
[24:32] understand the stars just like he
[24:34] brother brown said they would study the
[24:36] stars like we go to like a little a
[24:38] little ministers meeting or a bible
[24:39] study that the way that they would study
[24:41] the stars they were so as serious about
[24:43] that as we are about studying the word
[24:46] so when they saw something that was a
[24:47] little out of place or something
[24:49] something supernatural
[24:51] it caught their attention and they began
[24:52] to go on a two-year journey over to find
[24:55] out where
[24:56] what was going on
[24:59] and if we go we'll we'll close on this
[25:01] we'll read the matthew chapter 2 the
[25:02] first few verses if you could
[25:04] pull that up brothers
[25:07] when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[25:08] judea in the days of herod the king
[25:11] behold there came wise men from the east
[25:13] to jerusalem saying where is he that is
[25:15] born king of the jews for we have seen
[25:18] his star in the east and have come to
[25:20] worship him
[25:21] when herod the king had heard these
[25:23] things he was troubled in all jerusalem
[25:24] with him
[25:26] and when he had gathered all the chief
[25:27] priests and scribes of the people
[25:29] together he demanded of them where
[25:30] christ should be born and they said unto
[25:32] him and bethlehem of judea
[25:35] for thus it is written by the prophet
[25:38] and the musicians can go ahead and come
[25:39] forth
[25:41] and thou bethlehem and the land of judah
[25:43] are not the least among the princes of
[25:44] judah for out of thee shall come a
[25:46] governor that shall rule my people
[25:47] israel
[25:49] then herod when he had brutally called
[25:50] the wise men inquired of them diligently
[25:52] diligently what time the star appeared
[25:55] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[25:57] go and search diligently for the young
[25:59] child and when he have found him bring
[26:01] me word again
[26:02] that i may come and worship him also
[26:05] when they had heard the king they
[26:06] departed and lo the star which they saw
[26:08] in the east went before them
[26:11] till it came and stood over where the
[26:12] young child was
[26:14] when they saw the star
[26:17] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[26:19] and when they were coming to the house
[26:22] they saw the young child with mary his
[26:24] mother and fell down and worshiped him
[26:27] and when they had opened their treasures
[26:28] they presented unto him gifts
[26:31] gold and frankincense and murk
[26:34] bless you
[26:36] [Applause]
[26:44] you
