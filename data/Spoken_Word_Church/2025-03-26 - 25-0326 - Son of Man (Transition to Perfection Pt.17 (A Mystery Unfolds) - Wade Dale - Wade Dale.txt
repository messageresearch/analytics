just keep that in your heart it's only in you live but still ju I'll be here next week so um all M's clear everything good everybody happy I don't sound very good thank you we have sister Regina with us today on a Wednesday night man that's good yes we sure appreciate Lord working it out where you can you've been so many years to where you had been fellowshipping on Wednesday just because of the drive and that's fine but now you're here so God bless you if you got your bibles if you want to turn to uh I can't remember what that is I didn't put it on there but just just First Corinthians but just look at this up here but we're going to speak today continue on with a mystery unfolding so let's bow our heads and and uh ask the Lord to bless this meeting father we pray Lord that you'd bless us Lord we looked at these many quotes and different things from the prophet Lord and we know now that many people and I say many people are are doubting that that you did send us a prophet Lord I hope you open their eyes father because I sure see that without you sending a prophet we would be in bad shape we wouldn't know what to do we wouldn't know what to say we wouldn't know who to worship a father a son or a holy ghost we wouldn't know how to be baptized we wouldn't know how to live we wouldn't have church order Lord I Thank you so much for bringing Clarity to the word of God through your little prophet and Lord he'll get his reward millions of people will receive eternal life under his ministry Lord and I pray for the ones that are rebuking that Ministry father that you would touch them Lord don't let them cross the line because we're coming up to this great time of the third pole where Jes Jesus Moses even Noah preached to the totally lost those that could never be saved father I pray that you'd let us be diligent let us know that we are born again and in the family of God that we've done everything we can do Lord that we've stood in a place father and just stood there and waited on you to move Lord and you've moved on many people's lives we've seen it here Lord in just a short time we've had the group here Lord under my leadership father and it doesn't mean anything it's just that I see that people's lives are being changed that people are loving you more and that's the way we want Lord we we don't want a bunch of know it alls but we do want a bunch of know it alls that knows you only and father I pray that you'd bless each one tonight be with the ones that are sick we know there's some Lord requests Lord that that are not feeling well that are uh we know that the pollen is fallen and Lord that's just that's just you repopulating the world again Lord silently uh populating the whole world with pollen but Lord it does get in our nostrils sometimes and in our sinuses and I pray Lord that you would um take the people that are susceptible to that Lord and just touch their body Lord and heal them Father because you're the Healer you're the only one and I pray that you'd bless us now and be with us be with us this weekend Lord and touch the lives of the people Lord that's going to hear from you Lord from Brother David and they in the Methodist Church Lord I pray that you'd bless each one father in Jesus name amen but it's written I have not seen nor ear heard nor entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him all right now remember prepared for them that love him it's just like I'm going the little sermon I got figured fixed up for the Methodist people and and the church there we have plenty of electricity in this building to run whatever we have I know brother Gary it's a little bit it's a little bit guy uh we uh we need a little more electricity um Outlets but that Outlet's going to do you any good until you plug into it power's there power is there power for whatever you need is there that's the same way with the gospel the same way with the word of God the power is there God has supplied eternal life and all you got to do is plug into it and once you plug into it you get what that outlet will give you all right and we know it's a billion vaults with coming from the Lord because what it'll do is it'll save your soul and put you in the kingdom of God but you got to love him right all right you got to love him back that's all he wants he wants us to love him he don't want us to filo him he wants us to Agape him to love him unconditional but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things ye the Deep things of God now if you've got the Holy Spirit what's it going to do it's going to search out the Deep things that's what the scripture says and it's contrary to us it's contrary to what we are as human beings we don't like Mysteries now we don't like surprises but I like the mysteries of God cuz that's what we feed on we feed on these mysteries of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things look that are freely given to us of God now the power may go off in this building but God's power never goes off so once you plug into it you're not going to have you're going to have up days and down days but that electrical outlet is not going to have it that eternal life that's flowing freely but you got to plug into it brother Ernie Billa said one time he said we have plugged ourself into the Eternal and I and I I I get that 100% so you may be seated the Lord as his Blessing now we're going to continue on with the thought but we're going to take a different angle maybe in just a few minutes and um and look at something that uh we were looking at this afternoon and changed up a little bit so Matthew 13:11 now this is Jesus he said his answer to give said unto them because it given unto you you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to them it's not given so this is only to a special group of people we've read this quote many many times that it's only to that people people that will receive Revelation or have spiritual Insight the problem is is we have Insight sometimes it's just not spiritual amen all right the invisible Union of the Bride brother rown said look he said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home with the bride listen we are not people backing up we can't Christians back up to a Pentecostal experience 1906 you understand what I'm saying everybody needs a Pentecostal experience but we're not backing up to those days that we were babies and that we were floundering around we should be grownup we should be we'll see here in just a minute if you've not known it yet you'll know it tonight that that third pull that Ministry that brother Rand moved into was a Ministry of adoption that was a Ministry that had never been taught before not many people have been adopted but we'll look at it in just a second the Pentecostal represented that again we're in the bright age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than moses' law would have worked in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you're dead to that and you cannot have that first Corinthians all these things I was talking to someone this weekend and man how the how the devil can twist the word of God if you don't have a revelation that uh the person was saying that well Malachi 4 was in the Old Testament so brother R couldn't be a prophet because he was Gentile I said well you can you can you can believe that if you want to but I believe the Bible says behold I send you it didn't say behold I send the Jews he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet so whatever it was is for me and I don't care if it's New Testament or Old Testament it's always the word of God sure it has its allegory sure it has its time of of being um natural and then Supernatural and spiritual and non-spiritual and all these different things but you got to be able to by the Holy Ghost decipher and take those things and put them in your heart run them through your filter and say that ain't nothing but the truth like had R did now all these things happen unto them for examples of course the Old Testament people and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come and if that's not us then we're going to all we'll be all gone here in a few years and another group will come in but that's not going to happen there wasn't another group as we'll get to in just a minute there was not another group passed the group that Joshua took in right there wasn't another group rose up it was the group that rose up during Joshua's Administration end of Moses Moses goes off the scene Joshua takes over he and and Caleb positionally plac the people in the land everybody with me and we know that that Ephesians parallels Joshua and we see that the adoption comes when God places you and puts you in a place and says this is your place I want you to stay in that place just like he did with all the 12 tribes of Israel he said these are your boundaries you stay here you go over here and you go over here and brother Ram told us he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here she'll be an invincible Army the problem is is maybe we you're sitting here today well maybe I'm not this and maybe I'm not that well you got to find out right you got to find out and know know that you know that you know that's my whole thought I want you to know who you are and you got to you listen I can't give you a revelation you got to pray that God will give you a revelation even in the quietness of your home or in the night time praying that God will give you a revelation of what you heard from another minister or from brother brandham or or anybody that preaches the true word word of God I don't care how you get it as long as you get it right I don't Psalms 139 says my substance was not hid from thee think about a God that knew everything about us before he even created the world to put us on before our mom and daddy was even formed in the womb of their mothers and fathers and I mothers and mothers all the way down he knew who we were he knew where we'd be he knew what we'd be and where he would come to a place he would give you he would cross your path and what you do when you cross the path what a mighty God we serve and then see we can then we can stand and look back and see that it was that genealogy or C Gene of God that come all the way down even through the Old Testament it wasn't produced in the Old Testament come on but it was there in god Jehovah had it all with him then he came on Earth as a human being and even his genealogy of his own genetics of his of his male sperm didn't help anybody didn't that wasn't what he came for he came to bring us back to where Adam did what he did he did to alleviate that to bring us to a spiritual birth to a spiritual planting of a seed amen and that's what you received that's a new birth yes you received that part that God saw you had in Genesis 126 man before the foundation of the world man if we can't believe a God if we can't put our whole confidence that he knew everything didn't ever change his mind never made a mistake then find me somebody else that way there's not one so I put my sufficiency all in God my substance was not hid from thee When I Was Made In Secret curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth doesn't matter where you came from we all came same way all right and and I listened to a brother a little bit of to go talking about Rahab and brother U Luis did a real good job preaching on Rahab over in in Honduras but you look at all that that Joshua came across they're defeating everybody and they're fixing to to defeat the whole city of Jericho that the walls were so big you could run a chariot race around Joshua said you two men go find somebody in that City and witness to them they found a sorry ain't just plain they found a prostitute that's these two men Christian men tape boys is what brother Brown said found a house of a harlot but that's what God sent him to because he knew her heart he knew what she needed deep down inside wasn't what the world was giving her and they said you just throw this Scarlet rope down and we'll destroy everything but you but now you make sure you get your family in oh listen folks let's make sure we get our family in amen pray for them pray for themen then all you can see standing after all the rubble and after all the destruction and after Joshua came in and they wiped out an entire city there stood a there stood a a house with a red string running down it and Rahab come walking out and she married an Israeli General and that's the line that Jesus came from oh wow Grace don't ever ever forget the grace of God amen ever that's why God sent us a prophet for that Grace he sent us a prophet Thine Eyes didn't see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in contingence were fashion when as yet there was none of them God wrote this whole Bible and none of us were born but he wrote it for me he wrote it for you he wrote it he actually inspired Moses to write what happened just for me and you that's why I see it just like we were talking the other day me and brother Bob were talking about brother rand's Ministry he would I believe he would be preaching along and they would be something he that he needed to say he'd stop he'd say uh or or something and whatever he said that's what we use for a quote that brother brother Brown didn't maybe didn't know everything he did I don't know if he knew his whole 1100 sermons was going to do this I don't know that but it is and it did but every quote we use is to dovetail everything we're preaching in 2025 that he spoke in 1947 to 63 is for us to take the pieces and the Nuggets put them together and give them to the people am I just believe that 100% that he was totally totally surrendered to God in a pull pit I just believe that now he'll tell you what his opinion is though now he'll tell you his what his opinion is but when it comes thus sayith the Lord you better believe it because it came straight from God Malachi 3 then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and the Book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name that's Malachi 3 that's in the Old Testament I guess that's not for us no that's for me so the real secret we were looking at the other day is this Genesis 126 and sometimes it it staggers you to see that that this Genesis 126 man if you've been here a long time Dad's preached it for 40 years and i' that's one of my favorite scriptures so I kind of added in pretty much every sermon that I preach at Genesis 126 man it's not every person it's only the progeny of God he said let us make man in our own image now listen he made man in his own image he gave each person a soul but he didn't tell them to be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth subdue it take it over and you be the king of it that's not for everybody that's just for us that's just for his children he made this world to us for us to inhabit it as his children amen how do you know that that's what we're going to God don't change his mind remember right he didn't change his mind when Adam when Eve did what she did with the Beast it just prolonged his plan and made him much more of a God to be honored and praise because he took care of all these different things that you and I have to go through and like a Rahab and like a Ruth and and all these different Gentiles that are plugged into the the line of of the Jewish line typing us I mean we're all Rahab God sent somebody to us he sent a couple of T boys to me I'll promise you that in my low condition yours too so this great mystery is that genesis6 man is going to be made manifest on the earth in flesh all the way from the the first church age to today we are just the ending up of it we're the culmination of all this so the mystery where is the mystery the mystery is in US Christ in you Paul said the hope of glory but the world won't ever see that they'll think that what did they what have they done to Jesus what did they do with the 12 disciples only one lived to die of natural death one right the rest of them were killed for what they believe they'd go to a different place go to India and go try to spread the gospel and I'm sure they did but they all died horrible deaths soared pulled apart all these different things they were killed because of what because of the word of God that's why I love that song word of God ever true it it took a a group of people to come through these different ages to hand that word over and to preach it and hand it over to Paul and Paul puts it in print and this one puts it in print and now it's all together and it's ours there's a lot of blood on this Bible folks right a lot of natural spilled blood to get it to get this to where we're at today and why don't we read it Christ The Mystery of God revealed when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself what we was talking about electricity the current The Works that I do shall you be also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I will sent to you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself now watch in fullness of his godhead deity all right so the headstone the headship will come back and it is in the end time it wasn't during the church ages it is today the body was being built but now the head's got to sit on top of that body so much shall every move that we make is what he tells us to do I just believe that through his church have the pretences in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people so now where's the anointing the anointing was on the man the anointing was on a prophet now the anointing is on the people the anointing was on Moses the anointing was on Joshua and now if Joshua he passed away it was on a group of people that was Ruben and and all the different ones the 12 tribes it was on them and it kept going and kept going and kept going now the anointed people oh might to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with what the anointing of the word there's an anointing for every age there's a dispensation for every time and there's a Administration change just like we had in the government there's one in there's one in the in the word of God people that take over like here's Moses Moses had a job right all right he could see the promised land he told the people they were going to that land but he didn't get to go right I'll read that here in just a minute but Joshua was the man with the commission for the hour to take the people over all right everybody with me Revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brown said look now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means the unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor embeding his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker in other words it's covered up the work's been done it's just covered up right you can't see it but it's in there but all of a sudden the curtain gets pulled back and there is the statue that you're supposed to look at that was in the mind of the of the sculptor first if you and I looked at it it'd be just a big block of wood but Michelangelo could look at that big block of wood and he could in his mind cuz you know what if you hit the wrong if you hit the wrong piece with that chisel you could have knocked the arm off or even the head that you were going to build but they knew exactly what to do and they took that big piece of granite that old rough dull looking piece of granite me and you and the master sculptor has been chipping away down Through the Ages and he's chipped you and me out we're not the chips that lay on the ground were the statue am right it's an uncovering revealing what was previously hid now where was it all hid we'll get to this a little bit later on but not this this service where was it previously hid to us it was previously hid in Christ nobody understood Jesus Christ nobody understood who he was he came to the religious people that supposed to know and he actually he could have took a sheet of paper and wrote Every scripture down in the Old Testament and said I did every one of these what's your problem and really that's what he said he said you go read the scriptures he said have I come any different than that he wouldn't have been the word of God he wouldn't have been Jesus Christ if he hadn't come exactly so what about today we look at now we are trying our best to be that example everybody with me we're trying our best to be that example and we're going can't you see what's going on here this is us this is what we're doing this is our hour this is there and people are going I don't believe that it's somewhere else maybe it's somebody El for somebody else it's not for me well that's okay but this is for me I I just I just can't put my I can't put nothing in anything else nothing you tell me what to put it in now the uncovering is not only the revelation of Christ all right because to reveal Christ is to reveal the people of Christ because we are considered Christians right which acted like Christ but you with me on that I mean you act like Christ you look like Christ you act like Christ and listen you can tell the people of the world we're living this Bible just as best as we can and they're like well that's the Old Testament or that really is not for me or he didn't really mean that or that was his opinion talking about maybe somebody writing in the Bible that's their opinion I don't see that somebody's opinion is going to give me Rapture and Faith right amen Jesus never had an opinion he never had a skirmish with his father amen he said I only do that what my father shows me that's right and sometimes I I tell you brother Lis if we slow down before we made decisions sometimes we could act like the father let what inside of us be first instead of see we didn't do like Christ in the garden he says not my my will but thy will be done a lot of times we want my will and it's not God's will I was talking to a brother this this weekend and he said why are my prayer if this is if we're just so great why is my prayers not answered I said every prayer you pray is answered it just ain't answered the way you want it answered remember God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get think about that God will answer your prayer it may not be what you like but he'll answer your prayer and see that's the problem Us in humanity go well if he don't answer it the way I want it then it's he didn't answer it no wrong answer so it's also the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming Church ages and when I say Church ages I mean people it wasn't a building that said that Luther preached one building and that's all that happened in Luther's age Luther did start preaching and then Luther preached and the Revelation got caught by this brother and that brother and this brother and that brother and they spread it out across Europe at the time and then over here when Wesley came to the United States and started spreading it there so it's not just a church age it's Church age people there is no church age without people God's only going to do this through people he's not going to do it through a building or an idea right now here's what brother Brown said on the seventh seal we were talking about this the other day notice the next thing I took some kind of a bar cut it off he talk about the pyramid and inside was White Rock that had nothing wrote on now look had nothing wrote on it and at that time I started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast now where did he go west he went West to Tucson got the commission to come back to Jeffersonville and they were going to reveal the seals to him there they didn't reveal to him out there cuz it says look return back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word all right now if that isn't perfectly the God Almighty I want you to know what it is what am I trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time modern events make clear by prophecy that's why I was telling you that this Elijah the reason brother brandham was was so familiar with squirrels and birds and and all these different possums he was a man of the Wilderness just like Elijah was he was a man of the Wilderness he hated immoral women John the Baptist another Wilderness lover Hunter Woodsman so if if they had the character brother Brown had to have that same character okay he had no education hello brother Brown didn't either watch his text wasn't the like a theologian he said Generation of Vipers built this thing you can have in the wilderness was a snake he called those priests Generation of Vipers who warns you to free from the Wrath to come in other words he also talked about the axes laid to the root of the tree so brother randam was under that anoint that same Elijah anointing so God had to speak to him through these different things like fish and water and deer and Bulls and fish and uh possums and he understood that brother Ram understood that so it wasn't a mystery to him he understood these things so God used that and the same thing with me and you listen God is not I let me tell you something God didn't bring you this far to confuse you God will not confuse you right he's not a good daddy if he does that but now he lays it out to us and if we don't accept it who's confused we are we're the confusion but he lays it out to where we can get it even the people that don't have an education can get it illiterate person brother Brown said the most illiterate person so now the third poll or the three polls remember the remember the vision we're not going to go into it about the fish he caught a little bitty fish and then he messed the line up and he was heading to catch bigger fish he went to the tent Vision all those things you've already heard that a million times so not go over it again but you know the first pull was what the showing of his hand and calling out the sickness what was the second pull bring the person up to the prayer line bring them to the prayer line tell them what they were tell them their name most of the time where they live what was wrong with them and pronounced them healed or not right so that was the first pull was pulling the people up to that point all right everybody with me pulling the people up to that point from the Pentecostals that were just speaking in tongues and jumping and shouting you know brother randam was he put order to that he gave him prayer cards he said I want number one number two number three number four come up to the front and it made some order instead of everybody trying to rush up to the front of the every you listen if you saw that healing power you'd want to rush up there sometime I guess if there was no order to it but there's order to God but a pull is a force drawing someone or something in a particular direction or course of action so taking side Jesus brother R said look now look remember the commission this is where we'll we'll get another gear right here he had a commission remember the the angel said do the work of an evangelist I believe it's Thessalonians or do the work of an evangelist make proof of your ministry because with there'll be people with itching ears and all these different things and he wrote that down and put it in what he put it in the Cornerstone of the church in Jeffersonville all right he said do the work of an evangelist not be one do the work of one now listen I want to show you now this is 1962 in June one year before the seals open all right so I'm setting the stage here now as I have done the work of an evangelist and here is my plea if that is pleasing to God I've done the work all right trusting that I have pleased him asking for forgiveness for all my mistakes then he may be calling me from the field of evangelism to be his Prophet now how many times his brother Brown he he he' say prophet and stop say no no no that stumbles people he said I'm just a brother I'm just a I'm just a servant I'm just a se you know Seer but he said right here look then if it is I'll leave evangelism and what was his evangelism healing healing campaigns all right sure there's great nuggets in there and there's things like I said that that God put in these sermons that we pull out but but most of it was the prayer line the most of the people came for the prayer line but if he calls me to be a prophet I cannot be an evangelist it's 1962 right before the seals open if I'm to be an evangelist I cannot be a prophet I'm mixing the two offices that's where I've always fussed about now watch what he says standing on the platform it's never been good are successful 50,000 miracles in one sermon and he said it wasn't successful millions of people healed some instantly saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in his ministry and pulling bringing them up to the prayer line it's never been good successful you think he kind of figures out what his real message is fixing to be God has used it now watch God has used it but I've never thought it was his direct will I'm just reading you quote I've never thought it was his direct will it's been his permissive will remember the angel told him he said you messed up you tried to explain it you tried to you stood there in other words and wasted your time explaining it when you should have just told the people and left that's what the angel said yeah it's been his permissive will stand on the platform a vision or two will knock you out almost see and then if you now watch this then if you tell this person how to straighten himself out and what to do and then the next person stands there he's expecting the same thing H and you can't tell him L something tells you to tell him what a strain that you can somebody asked me the other day said well why doesn't Jesus why doesn't he heal every everybody I said let me tell you something brother I said that's real narrow-minded when God himself was here in human flesh when Jesus Christ was here in human flesh he went to a pool called Bethesda right he walked through hundreds of people brother Brown said worse off than that man sitting on the pallet they probably had a prostate problem he'd been he wasn't going to kill him he'd been alive 30 years why did he walk up to that one man and heal that one man you explain that to me and I'll explain to you why somebody get their healing some don't right all right I just pray for me to have more patience with people that are that sarcastic that has something illiterate to say like that when you can put it right in the scripture and say well Jesus did it when he was in on here on Earth he did the same thing there's no telling how many listen there's no telling how many crazy people he walked around but he went to one he went across the lake to one and cut to that one called Legion it's God he's Sovereign he does whatever he wants to do and he knows what he's doing so let's not correct him and figure out why he's not doing this and figure out why he's not doing that it may be our problem that he ain't that he ain't figured we ain't figured him out I'll promise you God's already figured us out everybody with me then the other people feel like you're a traitor or a backslider what about that or a demon or something because you don't tell them what they want to know see that's not the office the way a prophet operates how about that quote brother he put that in the Cornerstone of his Tabernacle do the work of an evangelist didn't say Be One do the work of one listen he had to come through the first pull second pull he had to get the people to come together the bait on the hook yes the hook was the unwritten part the book was the unwritten word the hook I mean was the unwritten word that's the that's the word that they hadn't seen because they saw the bait but they had seen the hook so let's read just for a minute right here Joshua 1:1 now we're we're we're looking at brother brandham now and he's preached from 47 to at least 1962 and he comes up to 1962 and he makes that statement I've not been successful in other words this is not my Ministry I'm going to have to quit being an evangelist I'm going to have to be a prophet I can't be a prophet though and be an evangelist so he's having to make a decision here because it's a juncture of time for him just as this was a junction of time for Joshua but God made sure that Joshua knew what he was doing now Moses did but Moses made the mistake right Moses made the mistake brother R saying he exalted himself above God and God said you can't go to the promised land now that's about direct quote all right and actually God told Moses you can't go across I told you to speak and you smote it twice now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass but the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your feet or foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even into the Great River the river euphrat all the lands of the Hittites and the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee can you say that to yourself that God's not going to ever fail us or forsake he can't can't change his mind amen be strong and of good courage now listen he wanted to make sure that Joshua knew this because he said it three times be strong and of good courage For unto this people all right now we're talking about adoption we're coming to adoption part we're coming to where brother random sees his adoption and then he's going to show us the land come on somebody he's going to show us the land he's going to describe the land he's going to tell us how to get there but he's not going everybody with me but he's not going amen now you know you know what I mean he's not he's not candidate for a body change without death right because he's passed away but he showed us everything we need to know to get there he showed Joshua and God said Joshua as I've been with Moses I'll be with you be strong and of good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land now what what was Joshua type of the Holy Ghost Caleb was a type of the end time believer but they're they're intertwined with each other is everybody with me all right only be thou strong and very courageous this is the second time he tells him that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee in other words quote to quot right get the mind of Moses and carry the people on I'm telling us today get the quotes right get the message right and let's move forward because brother brandham is not going to place us in our position it's going to be a five-fold ministry that's going to place us in our position okay so I depend on that which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou May Prosper whs soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou May observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way what prosperous and thou shalt have good success have I not in other words Joshua if you forgot I'm fixing to tell you what I've told you the second time I'm going to tell you the third time have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage I say today we need to be strong and of good courage don't go to the right don't go to the left don't even look to the right or the left go right down the path forget about I me you're going to get but brother Brian preach what is the attraction on the mountain well there's many attractions today besides the mountain that we can look at and get turned sideways we look over here we can get on the wrong website we can we can get on that stupid believe the sign junk I'm sorry it's of the devil they a't but one sign there're going to get and it's got a lake and fire on it it's not going to be that cuz they don't even believe in that that was just something that something happened that uh uh a jet went across or something think and stuff like that I don't like people stealing The Souls of good people right brother Bob I I I'm talking about stealing The Souls of good honest people I ain't talking about stealing Souls of somebody I'm talking about stealing the soul of somebody stealing the very life because one thing don't match this thing and this don't match that and he didn't do this he wasn't out there when that happened garbage it's just garbage amen have not I commanded the be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismay here we are in 2025 three months into it almost four Don't Be Afraid don't be dismayed listen the king's in the camp as I was with him so I'll be with you as I was with Moses Joshua Jesus brother Brandon Paul I'll be with you he can't change he's an unchanging God with unchanging ways like I said before though we got to plug oursel into that you do have something to do with it you got to plug yourself into it amen for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever Monday morning Tuesday morning Wednesday afternoon Saturday Sunday whatsoever you go you take god with you now watch all you get it now he's talking about going up on the mountain and the sword comes into his hand but watch the L father knows this just as true as you can see that come to pass those angels came right down and Vindicated every message to be the same then you know whether it comes from God or not it was foretold You by a vision I couldn't tell you until the service was over cuz I was forbidden to in Sabina Canyon sitting up there that morning I had my hands up the wind was blowed my old black hat down when I was standing there with my hands up praying he wasn't in a church he wasn't in a sanctuary he was had his old dirty clothes on come on somebody he had his old he is in his environment right he was where he wanted to be any y'all ever been I've been to Phoenix I've never been to tucon they say Ton's worse than Phoenix that is the driest ugliest place I ever seen in my life there's nothing green except what man puts there and it's artificial most of the time it's just blah but brother R loved to be on the top of that mountain where nothing but rocks sticks spiders um scorpions Havalina Hogs and somewhere not this one but the other one he was he was picking what we call begal which is a a l that gets on it's not Li it's a plant but it's got fuzzy things and it sticks to you and the reason they call it begal they beg it to get on you and you carry it all to your home and all that stuff cuckers why was it brother randam on a plush golf course and he had like birds chirping and you know flowers and the cool wind was blowing I'm sure at this time it's probably 100° on top of that mountain but he was standing there with my hands up praying I said Lord God what does this mean I can't understand it Lord have you ever ask him that here what am I doing what does this mean what does this whole us being here mean I can't understand it lord well if you tell him that then he's obligated somewhere to tell you why you're here and what you're doing here cuz this remember this third pull is your placing it's adoption right because it's the opening of the word the only way you're going to get adopted is the opening of the word what is them to do if I'm I'm I'm going home see he thought then now normally in his mind he thought I'm going to die there's going to be a great blast I'm going to be killed let him not find me he's talking about don't I don't want nobody to mourn me just let me go on tell the family to think I just took a walk and they won't find me hideing me away somewhere if I'm going to go away just let me go maybe Joseph will find my Bible laying here someday and let him use it if I'm going away let me go Lord and I had my hands out and all at once something hit my hand I don't know I can't say did I go to sleep I don't know did I go in a trance I don't know was it a vision I can't tell you only thing I can say is just the same thing like them Angels was and it struck my hand it was a sword had pearl handle real pretty had a guard over it with gold boy when God does something he don't do it he does it the right way cuz this was going to be a symbol of what he was going to do right all right and I remember years ago brother Harris preached a sermon right here he said the swords got to be in your hand too you got to have a sword in the hand experience amen you so I've never had it where I had you got to have a word experience right it's gold the blade look like something like a chrome like silver only it was real shiny and it was so feather edged sharp oh my and I thought isn't that the prettiest thing look it just fit his hand too it just fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I'm always afraid of them things a sword and I thought what will I do with that and just then a voice shook down through through there that rocked the rocks and said it's the sword of the king then I came out of it the sword of the king now if he'd have said a sword of a a k of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one king and that's God and he was had one sword and that's his word what I live by that so help me God standing here over this holy desk and with his holy word L listen if brother Bron was a liar he was a good one yeah right cuz I believe all that I believe it from my heart that God is leading him somewhere just like you can take your life and God see God leading you to the different places amen it took somebody to be our example though that God could be so close to that he could use him so much that we'd see that as an example and then we can say that ain't nothing but the truth and then we reap the benefits off of it you may never had a have a literal sword that was for brother brandham that was for a prophetic Ministry it was to show him he had the word of God not a word of God and then he can have boldness and confidence to stand in a pull pit and tell you thus sayith the Lord and tell you that what the first seal second seal third seal fourth fifth sixth and seventh and tell you with confidence what it was that's why any Minister should have confidence when they come up here to the pull pit you have confidence in what you're talking about if you don't believe it you need to sit down cuz you're doing your harm you're doing that harm worse than you're doing your harm CU you're harming the people and he has one sword and that's his word what I live by that so help me God standing over this holy desk with the holy word laying here it's the word oh my what a day we're living in now watch what the angel tells him about that scene oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery look the mystery and secret the third standing there when this left me something just came to me and said Don't Fear now what do he tell Joshua Don't Fear Place the people in the land do it as I command you brother brandom get off this mountain go do what I'm telling you to do and give it to the people pure and unadulterated do not back up do not get caught up in anything you just give it the way I got it now look he said now I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke I have to just tell you the truth this exactly what happened something hid and said Don't Fear this is that third pull okay this is that third pull which was what his sword in his hand the commission for him to not come off the Evangelical field but quit being an evangelist he had a work to do and when that sword hit his hand when he come down off that mountain I believe just like he would do me and you put a minister in the pull pit to say something and you say that ain't nothing but the truth and that's for me and I'm going to my next step this is for me and I'm going to bring people in people I I love it when y'all have comment about people that come in here to preach cuz I want them to lift you up listening to me all the time get could get boring but when you get something from God I don't care if you get five minutes you get something from God if it comes from God it's Eternal now what you do with it that's on you don't fear I just have to tell you the truth don't fear this is that third pull now what is the third pull the third pull is the opening of the word the third pull is that Unwritten part that he said was on the inside of that pyramid Mountain that nobody could read but him himself amen right on the outside we've got we've got the I may have this quote or I may laid it to the side he said we've got the water baptism when he goes through all the doctrines we've got all that but the unwritten part is what we are living this day for right the Joshua anointing is for us to be placed yes sir not just to believe the message not just to get born again which you got to start you got to do oh what a day we're living in mystery and the secret so now watch the third poll is an adoption Ministry a placing Ministry not the first pull and second pull first pull and second pull and I think I got it in my notes Here the first pull and second pull was bringing people to the to the church or bringing people to the meetings and Watching God heal them physically physically all right but now remember that's temporary I would I would I'm not going to assume I would say probably 99% of the people that come across the platform during his time of ministry have already passed away because there's been 60 years and they might if they were in their 20s it' been 80 something maybe just some small kids but most people have already passed on to their reward but the reward is is the healing of the body permanently and that's the placing Hey listen what did Joshua Place Israelites they were already in the family he couldn't Place some of that wasn't even in the family he didn't place he didn't place the Hittites and the jebusites he said drive them out right yes so now look even though Joshua he he now he has made it into to Jordan the waters parted the ministers as soon as they put their feet in the water the water parted is that all right all right the water parted the ark went across they went across on dry land showing that Joshua had the same God that Moses did come on somebody didn't God do that for him at the Red Sea part of the Red Sea they walked across on dry land same way happened in this Jordan but once they got over into the land think about this once they got over into the land something else had to happen Joshua 5:2 at that time the Lord said unto Joshua now this is not Joshua having a promin God's telling Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time all right and Joshua made sharp knives and if some of you kids don't know what that is your parents can tell you what it is circumcision but it's a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost a type of taking excess skin sin skin off of you okay everybody with me on that and to be an Israelite the commission that Abraham was given was is to circumcise all of his household and himself right right okay everybody with me on that but what had happened while they were in the Journey of Israel the ones that had been circumcised when they were in Egypt have all died and the young ones that had come up under that Ministry think about it that come up under that Ministry had not been circumcised they were Jews cuz they were born Jews right but there was there was a little extra needed to be cut off yes before they got placed are you with me had a little extra skin sin and skin sounds a lot alike and Joshua made him sharp knives now watch he didn't circumcise babies the people were in their 20s and 30s and 40s now men think about it yeah but now watch what a mighty God we serve watch what he did and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now look some of them came out of Egypt but they brought Egypt with them right Dayan Kora all the different ones that had problems with Moses they brought Egypt out with them and sometimes you and I we bring Egypt which is what the world out with us now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised so now I didn't put the next verse down there but the next verse is is that Joshua circumcised all those men there had to be some hundreds of thousands of males it was on the hill of the foreskin and that's what it is still today but they had to wait until they were healed up because I promise you you get circumcised at 40 years old you're going to walk different physically now we're talking spiritually though we get that circumcision now we had a circumcision when we give our life to Christ all right but God wants to put us in a position that the world's not there anymore he wants to place us as Israelites spiritually we are Israelites going in but there's a little bit extra we got to get off before this adoption can take place everybody with me right so they had to wait several days until they could till they were all healed up and then they continued on so I believe that's what's happening now folks we are a healing this is our healing time our circumcision of the mind of all the things that we've still been hanging on from Egypt well pray for me brother B said look is this sign of the insert 1962 if this is the third pull then there's a great ministry lying ahead all right this is before he preached the seals I don't know I can't say I don't know now listen real close and don't misinterpret this I want to ask you something let's go back just a minute the church knows it's the truth the scientific world knows is the truth people are sitting here tonight and many still living that was standing on the river when that voice spoke that out and said as John the Baptist I guess the believe sign people didn't believe that happened I hope I wish they would change us to disbelieve the sign biggest bunch of unbelievers I ever seen in my life but you know what I pray for them yeah that God will do something of course they're praying for us to get out of it so me it's a paradox all the people that have left the message they've got their they've got their list well I'll promise you if they you leave this message your name is not on the Lamb's Book of Life so you might be on a list and you might be in a book but you ain't in the book it we're written in I'm sorry this is a separating time it's time to get rid of the foolishness time to get rid of the excess skin time to cut that thing out and throw it away get rid of it if Joshua took hundreds of thousands of males got them together and got them listen to folk if you walked up to me and said buddy I got to circumcise you and I'm 6 5 years old me and you have fight but if I believe that what that man said that you're not going to go into this promised land and get you're here but you're not going to get your inheritance you're going to be hated God's not going to bless you right I'd say do it be it unto me according to Thy word right praise the Lord as John the Baptist was sent the message of the first coming so is this the second message of the second coming remember and if it's finished what did John do now John was the one who said behold now remember John was the third Elijah right he was commissioned to do one thing no prayer lines no healings preach six months and got his head cut off that's right stayed in jail most of that but he was to do one thing and point the world to Jesus Christ point the world to the son of man that's him it's the hour has it arrived my brother I don't say it has I don't know but I'm asking you I want you to think or will this be the time when it all will be again Behold the Lamb of God or the time of Malachi 4 to return the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers will it be such a blast that will do such Mighty things until it will set the church has been slopping and cannot understand the mysteries of God I believe that's true when they say that Mighty blast sweep when they see that Mighty blast sweep forth will it turn their hearts back to the father as the Bible said it would or was this the message already passed that should have done it I don't know look at the junction he said could it be what I preached from 47 to 63 or up until that time and then it struck him watch this it took you till 1965 for him to say this but at the Ed once at the end time notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to Clare declare his message see the first pull was healing the second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets so he's taking himself out of the Evangelistic role he's put himself into a prophetic role we know God did that he didn't do it but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals so there's no Myster now we know what the opening of the seals were it was the third pull it was that third pull to pull it all in to to get the excess skin to circumcise again us rededicate ourself amen realize you got to realize you're in the promised land first if you realize you're in the promised land you got an inheritance and this message was sent to give you that inheritance what was K a type of the believer right what Caleb say he was 40 when he started 80 when he got to the promised land and he said give me that mountain that's mine he said I'm more able now I feel better now I wish I was like that yeah if I felt as good at 80 as I did 40 bring me on 80 but we a we know it ain't happening but listen that was his Revelation that that was his Mountain right and what Joshua Joshua didn't say now I'll go I'll go get it for you no he said go remember he took his own men up there and took the thing right no more there's no more higher order than prophets but the way a prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pole was the opening of them themselves to reveal the Hidden Truths that's been sealed in the word so now look let's just sum this up and then we'll we'll stop right here the first and second Paul consider consisted of holding the hand of the person the hand changing colors and making bumps and all that stuff that we know that right then it moved which was it moved to the second PA which was brother Bown didn't even have to touch him he just and I love on that on that video that he starts doing this he starts doing this what's he doing he's contacting their Spirit he's watching what's going on he says you're so and so from so and so your name's Miss so and so you're from such and such street how plain was that he was looking right at it what he was doing so Millions gathered around brother brandom in the first and second poll amen the third poll The Mystery of the word that was sealed since Jesus Christ was on Earth Millions left him millions millions left when he started preaching when the third pole came into into being same way with Jesus you take Jesus Christ what happened to him first pole Z Paul they loved it when he took a when he took Five Loaves and two fishes and fed a whole Community 6,000 people that's more than in Lula and well there's about 60,000 in Hall County but you could feed a big a big town with 6,000 people you he fed them all in one day and picked up enough for them to have another day they loved it so boy that was all around him but when he stood one day and said I and my father are one I come to do thy will oh Lord I'm the one that Joshua was talking about or Moses is talking about I'm the one remember they said Moses we've got Moses he's our prophet he said if You' have known Moses you'd know me right and they said I and my father are one they hated him for that they hat brother random when he he started preaching Doctrine the doctrine that was the truth that nobody had ever seen before am now watch we'll close right here we've been on this for a long time I always go back to the questions and answers on the seals this is on the he preached the first seal to the to the Sixth Seal and then this was Sunday morning I believe it was or either Saturday he stopped and had questions and answers right before he preached the seventh seal everybody with me all right in chronological order that's the way it went there was a gap between six and seven there always is all right now look remember brother R told him you're not getting it it's not for you it's gone from you well now this is the end of the quote I read you the quote before this is the end of it he said don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian cuz you take yourself away from God and you you if you can understand it this is that third pull you should have caught that the other day he'd made all that he' made all that quote that that I've read to you many many times it's gone from you it's not for you uh it's not the right crystal there's voices going through here you should have picked it up in other words spiritual voices voice of God he said but he said right here he said you should have understood or caught that the other day you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two so there's not going to be another prayer line like brother R had right cuz what would happen when and even under the second pull under the second pull the lady or or man would come up and he'd say you're from so and so and you're from so and so and you're from and now like oh yes that's right brother that's right that's right that's right now that didn't mean they're saved right that didn't mean they knew nothing about the word of God they got healed that was a healing M Ministry but when he started opening the word of God up there wasn't a whole lot of amens a lot of omes CU he was digging into what they had never seen before but it wasn't for them amen right that was reserved for me and you amen you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was the other two there's no one ever going to preach like brother Brandon preached the Mysteries no one they impersonated the first pole they had blood on their hands they had oil that would drip out of their face and oil that would drip they'd have a they'd have a stick that would go down here or a pipe and they'd run away it was all fake some of it was real yes God honored the he didn't have to get honor the person right but there was impersonations but you can't impersonate the word of God that's never been shown who can who can interpret it only God can interpret it and he can only give it to a prophet right I'll do nothing Amos said unless I reveal it first to my servant the prophet so without a prophet it's what I was telling the brother the other day without a prophet you don't get nothing right it had to come through a prophet we had to know what was going on and brother Brown said look so see that's as far as you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room we're still on the The Sixth Seal the questions and answers on the seals there's something taking place in this room and there's something here there's actual in this room Angels voice of God see but how you can't if you can't hear the natural Voice without something to send it out how are you going to hear the spiritual voice what he was telling them that hole from the first seal open all the way up to there they did not get that Unwritten part if you can't hear the natural voice his natural voice how are you going to hear the spiritual voice I hope you don't key in on my voice I hate my voice I can't listen to myself on tape I don't like it it's not good but can you hear what's being said that God can give something you know I'm going to um let's stand to our feet we'll get musicians we'll just stop right there um you know sometimes we are uh we get so spiritual about things we we want to say thou and thee and now my God's Not he don't speak Southern language but he understands it so I talk to him just like I talked to you I drive down the road I say Lord now there's something going on something going on around here now what is it let's talk about this is it this is it that and I say maters and ters and ha and told as brother R said and G yet and he understands everything I said yeah I don't have to say thee and thou and though and and all that I'm sorry we don't have to because he's a god of variety he's a God that deals with you just what I'm the point I'm trying to make is he dealt with brother brandham the way brother brandham saw life right the way he saw life is how God interpreted everything and everything had an example to it the bull there was the third pull speaking of the word all these different things the fish catch the fish pulled his guts out the posum walking up to his house it was all in nature and he speaks to us the way we can understand that what makes it it's going to be our fault that we don't make it folks God has talked plain to you just like you hear him talking or somebody else talking to you maybe your brother sister or whoever that's what God's talking to you with everybody with me so let's don't think it's some booming voice and sometimes maybe it is God was the Living Word made manifest and they missed it is it the Living Word made manifest today and are we missing it are you hearing the voice of God or you just hearing the voice right are you letting it go deep are you really honing in on not what mistakes I make and what mistakes brother randam make or brother Aaron or or brother Luis or brother Bob or anybody else listen you can find anything you want to look for anything like brother Dell always said he said give me a quote he said I promise you in about 10 minutes I can give you three quotes that sound different than that one I said sound different now Jesus himself God stood one day and he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me now did we just go jump out and start being cannibals we know what he said by interpretation by the Holy Ghost I said interpretation by the Holy Ghost we understood what he was saying so the now the the word this Unwritten word you listen that's why brother R said we got to have Revelation more than anything cuz you can sit here and you can do as as they're doing now you giving them something and they've already got a quote they've already got this set opposite for it you tell them this you already got this opposite for it right you can't get it but by revelation that's the unwritten part so you listen you're not going to find it in here you're going to find it with this in here you're going to find it not here you can you can find all kind of listen you can find contradictions because it's what you're looking for if you take this Bible and give it to a Baptist he's going to preach out this very same Bible I got in my hand today with what three eyes trinitarian eyes right he's going to see it with an eternal hell eyes Bible does say Everlasting Eternal punishment there is an eternal punishment but there's not an eternal hell right we know that because there only one form of eternal life and it's so simple just say God's the only person that's got eternal life why would he be in hell why would he put people in hell and give them eternal life pretty simple but you know what they'll hang their soul on it I want to ask you a question before we close what are you hanging your soul on right you hanging your soul on some God's going to send somebody else or he's already sent that person we just need to know what he's saying because I believe it was the voice of God in the end time for a group of people there's going to be people folks that's going to fall away just like first pull second pull crowds pack them in love the brother love the brother love brother brandom loved you love me we could F this building up if we start having signs and wonders right but the word of God is the whole thing that's right and sometimes it may be dull and it's just what you do with it let's sing a song I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus

and Caleb did that one day they was going to get to the promised land they knew they weren't in the promised land but they were going to get to it but it had to be a journey brother John 40 years long to get rid of the unbelievers cuz we didn't get into it but we'll get into it later on the third pull we know it's the opening of the word but as the word opens and you deny it that's where Jesus went to hell and preached to people that we eternally lost there's no way they can find God they shut the door let's not be that way but it is the third poll it's part of it it's part of the third poll that we got to we got to cover that there is a group of people that will send their day of Grace away and still sit in a message Church brother rown said still thinking they get the Holy Ghost you
