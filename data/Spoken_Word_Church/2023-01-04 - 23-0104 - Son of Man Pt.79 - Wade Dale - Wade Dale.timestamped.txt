[11:23] okay but they're leaving Wednesday so
[11:25] what Sunday is we're going to have both
[11:28] Services we're going to take up an
[11:29] offering for them the church is going to
[11:31] provide the plane tickets for Bob and
[11:35] and brother Louise now because they're
[11:37] ministers here and they do this from the
[11:39] church so we'll be paying for their for
[11:41] their plane fare but we'll also be
[11:44] giving them some extra money if you want
[11:45] to give anything the the offering now

[11:54] um write a check give them cash
[11:56] that will be for them to use
[11:59] over there I thank God that some of our
[12:01] youth are going I wish every one of our
[12:03] youth would go one time overseas
[12:07] you'd come back with a lot different
[12:09] attitude
[12:10] when you see all the luxuries I was
[12:12] thinking yesterday you look at America
[12:15] and what we call
[12:18] Expendable income which is
[12:21] paying you know seventy thousand dollars
[12:24] for a vehicle
[12:25] uh having somebody keep up your lawn for
[12:28] a hundred dollars a week you go and
[12:31] having a pedicure and a and uh whatever
[12:33] else it is a maybe in a petty all the
[12:36] things that you do
[12:39] they just survive over there
[12:42] they can't fathom driving a seventy
[12:44] thousand dollar car
[12:45] they can't fathom going and having a new
[12:49] set of clothes every week
[12:51] that's just not in there that's just not
[12:53] in their budget
[12:57] um clean water is in their budget you
[13:00] and I drink water and go get bottled
[13:03] water and we get all this other stuff
[13:05] I thought man all the reason I saw that
[13:08] was some boats that went by that were
[13:10] being pulled by seventy thousand dollar
[13:12] trucks and it's probably a fifty
[13:14] thousand dollar uh bass boat and all the
[13:16] other things to go with it I thought man
[13:19] that would take a you could take a whole
[13:22] church
[13:23] and Nicaraguan you could build it build
[13:25] a pastor a house
[13:28] just by what drove by me
[13:31] one car
[13:33] we've been blessed in this United States
[13:35] but I promise you one thing
[13:37] we're going to be cursed
[13:39] Above All Nations according to what the
[13:42] prophet said because we turn the nation
[13:44] turn God down
[13:46] amen so let's just we're going to pray
[13:48] with them Sunday also before they leave
[13:50] we'll have them come up and we'll have
[13:53] prayer for them
[13:54] this coming Sunday so just remember that
[13:58] keep that in your prayer bring some
[13:59] extra money for them to take with them
[14:02] and do as they see fit uh don't bring it
[14:06] back
[14:07] once it's yours is yours we don't want
[14:09] it
[14:10] all right now the 28th that will be
[14:14] Saturday at three o'clock brother Daryl
[14:16] Ward will be here and we will have a
[14:18] um
[14:19] uh Saturday youth service at three
[14:23] on the 29th brother Daryl be with us
[14:25] again one service
[14:27] remember on February the 11th we're
[14:28] having our Valentine's Banquet just
[14:30] remember that if you bring in somebody
[14:32] uh be thirty dollars for a couple that's
[14:35] not a Kyle's pair of this church if you
[14:37] want to bring somebody
[14:38] that'll be thirty dollars you need to

[18:12] before we're used to
[18:13] you know clean sheets and and if you
[18:16] heard brother Wayne uh some of his
[18:17] testimony not up here but won't in
[18:19] private about some of the places he's
[18:21] been that you know just you lay down on
[18:23] a board for two or three days a board
[18:26] and you preach your heart out three
[18:28] services a day and they feed you
[18:29] something that he said one time he said
[18:32] he said they said do you want to eat
[18:34] this and he said would I offend you if I
[18:36] didn't
[18:37] they said no he said well I'm not going
[18:39] to eat that
[18:40] because they told him what it was and it
[18:42] was some pretty you know
[18:44] anyway
[18:45] let's go to the Lord in prayer but thank
[18:47] you again have a wonderful New Year we

[18:51] you for all the things you've done this
[18:52] past year if it wasn't for you guys we
[18:54] wouldn't have church
[18:55] a church is Sovereign but you know what
[18:57] the church is Sovereign because of the
[18:59] people
[19:00] it's not sovereign because one man rules
[19:02] the whole place except the Holy Ghost
[19:04] but it's Sovereign because the people
[19:05] are in this building all right it's you
[19:08] that make this thing go not all it's not

[19:24] you're trying your best to get your
[19:26] people to see that you're here
[19:28] and that you want the characteristics of
[19:30] your life
[19:32] and your own body
[19:35] to be into this group of people now that
[19:37] we are your body and we're going to talk
[19:39] about that a little bit tonight about a
[19:41] virtuous woman
[19:42] and Lord I pray that you just be with
[19:44] the ones Lord that are sick
[19:46] sister Freda
[19:47] uh brother Louise if I miss one I'm
[19:51] sorry but all the sister Janine
[19:53] different ones Lord I pray that should
[19:54] be with him and touch them Lord and take
[19:58] that away from them that they will be
[20:00] raised up Lord especially brother Louise
[20:02] and brother Bob I pray Lord tonight that
[20:04] you would protect them
[20:06] and the ones that are going to I pray
[20:08] that you would protect them and keep
[20:09] them safe from sickness
[20:11] and from disease and from any kind of
[20:13] form of of evil that wants to come among
[20:18] them Lord I pray that you would protect
[20:20] them with the angels of the Lord father
[20:22] be with the missionaries on the Foreign
[20:23] Fields and many ones that we hear from
[20:25] Lord Brother
[20:26] brother Boaz sent messages saying Happy
[20:30] New Year and that they were baptizing
[20:32] people and getting Church age books out
[20:34] and and Hebrew series books and we thank
[20:37] you Lord for that that they're able to
[20:38] get the word of God here we are sitting
[20:40] with a library that we can put in our
[20:42] pocket and they're just wanting one book
[20:45] Lord how fortunate underway please don't
[20:47] let us pass this opportunity by
[20:50] to give this message to A Dying World
[20:53] father we pray that you should be with
[20:55] us now in a further with his service in
[20:57] Jesus name we pray amen
[21:01] starting your stuff blew up over here
[21:04] it's on a man part 79 all right
[21:08] in the beginning was the word word was
[21:09] with God and the Word was God the word
[21:11] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[21:14] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[21:15] begotten of the father
[21:16] full of grace and truth you can go into
[21:18] them
[21:19] when we look at this why don't we read
[21:21] this every time we read this every
[21:23] Sunday we read this every Wednesday when
[21:24] we preach but that word was made flesh
[21:27] because of a situation that it the Flesh
[21:31] of Adam and Eve fell anybody with me so
[21:34] it's got to come back then through flesh
[21:37] your kinsman redeemer is going to have
[21:38] to be everything he said he was
[21:42] flesh everything he said he was had to
[21:45] come flesh that's why the prophet tells
[21:47] us many many many thousands of time in
[21:49] the message the fullness of the godhead
[21:52] bodily was in Jesus Christ and now we
[21:55] know that by the transforming power of
[21:57] the Holy Ghost that same holy ghost that
[22:00] same person is in me and you all right
[22:02] called the brides so now the word that
[22:05] Jesus spoke is now being made flesh in
[22:08] US dwelt Among Us dwelling Among Us and
[22:12] absolutely supposed to be taking over
[22:15] our life
[22:17] y'all can say Amen if you want to
[22:19] you have my permission
[22:22] 31 we're going to get to this a little
[22:24] bit this afternoon or this evening who
[22:26] can find who can find
[22:28] a virtuous woman boy that's kind of hard
[22:30] to do in this old United States of
[22:32] America and around the world
[22:34] because they can't keep their self and
[22:36] you know what's happening around the
[22:37] world the denominations can't keep their
[22:40] self Satan has crept in so much and give
[22:43] them false Doctrine and a lot of them
[22:44] even in the message because a virtuous
[22:47] woman is a woman that won't take just
[22:48] anything she's pure she's holy she's
[22:51] right she's righteous I'm going to read
[22:54] this to you in just a minute
[22:56] Genesis 2 9 says and out of the ground
[22:58] now we're going to get to knowledge
[23:00] maybe a little bit later but definitely
[23:03] Sunday we're going to talk about
[23:05] knowledge which is the next
[23:07] virtue and and knowledge my knowledge up
[23:11] brother Wayne was speaking Friday night
[23:13] and he was laying some words out and I
[23:15] was writing them down because you can
[23:17] take knowledge to wise unwise no
[23:19] knowledge wisdom Spirit of wisdom
[23:22] understanding being known
[23:25] that's all got to do with knowledge but
[23:29] now there's two kinds of knowledge
[23:30] there's one in the Bible Genesis 2 9
[23:32] says out of the ground made the Lord God
[23:33] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[23:35] the sight and good for food now that's
[23:38] natural botany life
[23:40] everybody with me say Amen that was
[23:43] botany life he says that little whatever
[23:46] that is semicolon stop and think a
[23:48] minute because I'm fixing to change my
[23:49] thought the Tree of Life the tree of
[23:51] life was not a tree it was a person to
[23:53] Jesus Christ everybody with me all right
[23:55] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[23:57] Evil which was the devil everybody with
[23:59] me on that now if they would have eaten
[24:01] of the tree of knowledge I mean of of
[24:03] Life they were to live Tree of Life Tree
[24:08] of Life
[24:10] but no we decided to eat off the tree of
[24:12] knowledge of Good and Evil and that's
[24:13] how we got here and that's how that we
[24:15] have even grow up that's why you'll see
[24:17] brother Brown say over here he'll say
[24:19] the educations of the devil well if we
[24:21] let that kind of education rule our life
[24:23] yes it is of the devil
[24:25] if they tell you if science tells you
[24:27] that it was a big bang theory if science
[24:28] tells you that we came from this or that
[24:30] or the other don't take that knowledge
[24:32] we're going to take Godly knowledge
[24:34] because there is a certain thing called
[24:36] Godly knowledge watch this right here
[24:38] but now we want knowledge not just first
[24:42] grade knowledge
[24:44] everybody with me we don't want just for
[24:45] now first grade knowledge is good
[24:48] some of you may have been smart enough
[24:49] to skip a grade some of you may not and
[24:52] Miss degrading all right that's natural
[24:54] but in God it's the same way you can sit
[24:57] here in the view and you can you can
[24:59] learn nothing
[25:00] or you can sit here and you can just go
[25:02] right on up that pyramid and the guy
[25:04] sitting beside of you or the lady
[25:06] sitting beside of you is not getting
[25:07] nothing it's up to you remember brother
[25:09] Ryan said he's building individuals
[25:11] we'll read that quote just a little bit
[25:14] Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall teach
[25:16] knowledge so it's got to be taught to
[25:19] you all right and Whom Shall he make to
[25:22] understand what Doctrine
[25:25] you can't do without Doctrine you got to
[25:27] have Doctrine there's what there's false
[25:29] Doctrine and then there's real Doctrine
[25:31] all right all right look and Whom Shall
[25:34] he make to understand Doctrine he's
[25:36] asking a question and then he's going to
[25:38] answer the question them that are what
[25:40] weaned from the milk
[25:42] not still drinking milk weaned from the
[25:45] milk and drawn from the breast listen we
[25:48] draw from El Shady eye we know that the
[25:50] breasted one but you're gonna have to
[25:52] get off of them every once in a while
[25:54] you're gonna have to grow up he don't
[25:55] want you to be a crybaby all your
[25:57] Christian Life he wants us to grow up
[26:00] and eat some what Paul says we'll get it
[26:02] to it a little bit later not today but
[26:04] strong meat
[26:06] that's for us strongly as we go up to
[26:08] Statue of perfect man I want you to
[26:10] understand this is a Christian Life
[26:14] foreign
[26:15] if you want to
[26:19] Isaiah 53 10 says yet it pleased the
[26:21] Lord to bruise him he hath put him to
[26:23] grief
[26:24] well Thou shalt make his soul an
[26:25] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[26:27] he shall prolong his days in the
[26:30] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[26:31] his hand he shall see of the travail of
[26:34] his soul and shall be satisfied
[26:37] by his knowledge
[26:39] by his knowledge
[26:42] shall my righteous servant justify many
[26:44] so it's the knowledge of God given not
[26:47] to a second person called Jesus
[26:49] it's the same God moving into another
[26:52] office and being able to as the prophet
[26:54] said condescend I want us to see God had
[26:57] to come down here to get us to go there
[27:00] all right so he had to come down here
[27:02] live a life so that we even have an
[27:04] example
[27:05] we have no other example except Jesus
[27:07] Christ all right you want Judas uh
[27:10] please you want Peter you want Peter BC
[27:14] before Christ no
[27:17] you want Paul BC Paul had Christians
[27:20] killed
[27:24] he said he did it wasn't just a rumor
[27:26] it's in the Bible
[27:28] he said I caused him to blaspheme
[27:31] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[27:34] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[27:36] shall my righteous servant what justify
[27:39] many so now we bring in knowledge
[27:41] together to where it's going to justify
[27:43] many because we're going to read here in
[27:44] just a few minutes where brother Brown
[27:45] calls us The Virtuous sinless bride of
[27:48] Jesus Christ Justified never did it in
[27:50] the first place all right that's what
[27:52] you and I got to come to
[27:54] because if not you're going to fight
[27:56] you're going to fight your old nature
[27:57] you're going to fight your old person
[27:59] you're going to fight fight and we
[28:01] listen it's a fight anyway
[28:05] for he shall bear their iniquities who
[28:07] mine and yours
[28:09] John 17 17. so let's start here now
[28:12] sanctify them through thy truth
[28:16] Thy word is part truth
[28:19] that's not what it said
[28:20] Thy Word
[28:22] is truth as thou has sent men to the
[28:25] world
[28:26] Jesus Christ so have I also sent them
[28:30] into the world
[28:31] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[28:34] that they also might be Sanctified
[28:36] through the truth through what the truth
[28:39] now what is sanctification it's red is
[28:42] there anybody with me sanctification's
[28:44] red even the second horse rider is read
[28:47] excuse me but sanctification you're only
[28:50] Sanctified by the blood right remember
[28:52] you're kept saved by the blood of Jesus
[28:54] Christ in other words the washing of the
[28:56] Water by the word but that water is
[28:58] blood
[28:59] all right you can pour gallons and
[29:02] gallons of water on top of your head you
[29:04] will not get clean where you need to be
[29:05] clean but you can take the blood of
[29:07] Jesus Christ and plead the blood of
[29:08] Jesus Christ and God will clean you up
[29:11] amen he'll not be able to see your sin
[29:13] he'll hear your voice
[29:15] through that and I want us to get to
[29:17] that
[29:17] that also they might also be Sanctified
[29:21] through the truth now I want to look
[29:23] here and stop just for a second
[29:25] now what is sanctification brother Brown
[29:28] tells us it's a compound word we know
[29:29] this we and I want to give you all some
[29:32] uh reach your hand out like this
[29:34] everybody reach your hand out like this
[29:36] go backwards like this and pat yourself
[29:38] on the back
[29:40] brother Wayne said he had not felt it's
[29:42] free to preach in the church as he had
[29:44] here
[29:45] and I mean he may have but he said this
[29:47] weekend was just it just flowed he
[29:49] didn't have to stop he just went right
[29:51] on through and I appreciate it he's
[29:53] because we've been taught well amen
[29:56] [Applause]
[30:04] or drinking milk you got to bring more
[30:07] quotes to prove what you're talking
[30:08] about you got to bring more time to go
[30:12] back and say this but
[30:14] he said no he said I just want to
[30:16] straight through because we don't
[30:20] we don't need every quote
[30:23] we know them
[30:24] we know him by heart
[30:26] that's why amen quotes you have to amen
[30:30] quotes if somebody reads you a quote you
[30:31] better amen it
[30:33] not their quote brother Brown's quote
[30:35] right so sanctification is clean and set
[30:37] aside for service now we know that in
[30:40] the
[30:43] stuck here somewhere the first part of
[30:45] sanctification though is in your soul it
[30:48] takes and cleans out your soul where
[30:50] does that unclean Spirit go out of let's
[30:52] bring that chart up if you don't mind
[30:54] real quick because I wanna everybody
[30:56] even the young ones to understand what
[30:59] we're talking about
[31:01] they'll give them a second to pull it up
[31:02] there it is
[31:04] all right just can you move it up a
[31:06] little bit more
[31:07] there you go now we know that we have a
[31:10] body a spirit and a soul everybody with
[31:12] me all right we've been through this
[31:15] this is actually a chart that brother
[31:17] Dale used many many years ago
[31:19] all right so we see that the body is
[31:22] what the body is going up to the go to
[31:25] the very bottom because that's where the
[31:26] uh seed tastes still smelling here now
[31:29] there's nothing you can do about that
[31:31] that is given to you as the prophet said
[31:33] to what to contact this world
[31:36] see
[31:37] taste feel smelling here but every one
[31:41] of those
[31:43] can be absolutely deceived
[31:48] every one of those
[31:50] I thought I heard a no it wasn't that
[31:53] I thought I saw him
[31:55] like I said before Jim makes many
[31:57] concoctions at the B Store and we can
[32:02] make dirt out of out of a liquid because
[32:05] man has put the chemical chemicals
[32:07] together if you close your eyes and
[32:08] smell that soap it's like somebody's got
[32:10] a piece of dirt in her hand so it can be
[32:12] what these can all be deceived that's
[32:14] why Satan can move in and out through
[32:16] those but he goes on into that middle
[32:19] realm the next one which is what
[32:21] imagination conscious memory reason and
[32:24] affection everybody with me all right
[32:26] now when you're born again
[32:29] when you're born again
[32:35] see if this still works we haven't used
[32:37] it in a long time if we do this tonight
[32:39] maybe I'll keep you awake
[32:42] well you can't really see that can you
[32:46] okay
[32:47] this is your stall
[32:50] this is the person of you
[32:53] and there's only
[32:55] two things you can be in your soul and
[32:58] that you can have the faith of God
[33:02] or the doubt of the devil
[33:05] there's no end there's no tweener all
[33:07] right but now when you go through baby
[33:10] form when you go through justification
[33:11] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[33:13] what are we dealing with we're dealing
[33:16] with this guy right here
[33:19] everybody okay we're dealing with this
[33:22] inner man this Center of you the heart
[33:25] that's what God's got to change first
[33:29] man's tried to change here and here but
[33:31] left that alone
[33:35] you got to get in the holy of holies
[33:38] where God is or is not
[33:41] and that unclean spirit that adamic
[33:44] nature that you're that that's attached
[33:46] to your soul when you were born as a
[33:48] baby you got a soul is everybody with me
[33:50] you got a soul something that fires you
[33:53] that that's your being it may it helps
[33:55] makes you breathe it makes you do all
[33:56] the things of life
[33:58] and it also does what your intelligence
[34:00] this is where your intelligence comes
[34:03] from not here
[34:05] as a man thinketh that his heart
[34:08] you say no I think out here no you're
[34:09] thinking here
[34:11] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[34:14] all right
[34:15] so now when the Bible says in the Book
[34:18] of Luke that the unclean Spirit goes out
[34:20] of a man it's not here
[34:22] it's here
[34:25] that means there's something that's
[34:27] unclean in your throne room
[34:29] okay as many people in the message say
[34:33] that you've got you've already got this
[34:35] at Birth brother Brown said it's not
[34:36] faith and doubt
[34:39] come on somebody it's Faith or doubt
[34:42] you can't have both of these dwelling in
[34:44] a vessel at the same time
[34:48] you're either lost
[34:50] are you born again one of the two all
[34:52] right
[34:53] now you have representation
[34:56] a predestination there is a seed but
[34:58] it's in the mind of God that seed is a
[35:00] word right it's not a little they always
[35:02] try to make it some little speck
[35:04] you know it's a little sticky something
[35:06] right here no
[35:09] it's in the word of God
[35:11] the seed is a word of God
[35:13] the seed is not something that's like a
[35:16] seed you plant in the ground and it's
[35:18] definitely not like sperm in
[35:20] reproduction
[35:21] anybody with me
[35:23] okay
[35:24] so we come here and we have either Faith
[35:27] or doubt
[35:32] now you can either have the holy of
[35:34] holies or you can have
[35:36] the Hades of holy
[35:39] one of the things but you're born with a
[35:41] nature Fallen nature Fallen nature okay
[35:44] there's a there's there's an adamic
[35:47] nature attached to you that when you get
[35:51] to the age of accountability listen when
[35:54] you get to the age of accountability
[35:55] that's when God records and thank God
[35:59] that he sent us a prophet that told us
[36:02] that all babies go to heaven and if
[36:04] you're if you're eight nine ten years
[36:06] old or somewhere in there and you pass
[36:08] away then guess what you go to heaven
[36:11] you're not bribed because you can't
[36:12] clean this up like
[36:14] the Holy Ghost can
[36:17] but thank God he can cover you by the
[36:19] blood of Jesus Christ and give you
[36:21] eternal life
[36:22] but now not here though you'll be given
[36:24] eternal life at the white Throne
[36:25] judgment
[36:26] everybody all right okay so now but
[36:29] let's say let's say now we have come to
[36:32] a place that we have been uh Luke verse
[36:34] whatever it is Luke 4 or whatever it is
[36:36] where it says the unclean Spirit goes
[36:38] out so remember the unclean spirit I
[36:40] like where you got these little holes
[36:41] right here the unclean Spirit goes out
[36:44] walks and dry places listen you're not
[36:46] dead you're still the same person
[36:50] but boy you sure think different your
[36:52] nature should be becoming a little bit
[36:54] different there's something in here
[36:56] that's what this being there's something
[36:58] being taught you there's something being
[37:00] you know the devil hates the word of God
[37:04] so if you'll start putting the word of
[37:05] God in here it drives that unclean
[37:08] Spirit out come on somebody you guys you
[37:10] got to really want that thing to be gone
[37:12] and not just go oh I wish oh I wish no
[37:15] start giving it the word of God
[37:17] go to church
[37:20] start cleaning up
[37:22] find the right people you know what if
[37:24] you if you go if you're in the right
[37:25] form of sanctification you'll find the
[37:27] right people
[37:28] you'll not be with the same people
[37:29] because birds of a feather white flock
[37:31] together
[37:32] so now let's say that the unclean
[37:34] spirit's gone out now if if you're if
[37:37] you're going to allow it by it you're
[37:38] gonna allow it right through back in
[37:40] you're gonna be worse
[37:42] seven times worth the Bible says you're
[37:44] going to be really religious and Satan's
[37:46] just going to do what he's going to just
[37:48] make you religious all the way out to
[37:50] here
[37:53] am I correct
[37:55] but if you get born again in here that's
[37:58] the fire of God that's your soul that's
[38:00] your Center being that's your heart
[38:03] you've been given a new heart
[38:06] remember brother Brown said it the first
[38:08] what is what does God do he softens you
[38:11] up
[38:12] he gives you a new spirit but it's not
[38:14] the Holy Spirit
[38:16] but let me but let me let me restate
[38:19] what he says it's not a devil spirit
[38:23] it is the holy spirit it's a peace of
[38:25] the Holy Spirit
[38:26] showing you that this can be gone
[38:29] we can lock this in and he can stay
[38:31] there and reside
[38:34] not just come down on you and anoint you
[38:36] because that's anointed ones what is
[38:38] Anointed ones false hear true listen to
[38:43] me true here
[38:47] gifts of the Spirit are here they're not
[38:49] here
[38:51] this is one gift
[38:53] Acts 2 38 and you shall receive what the
[38:56] gift of the Holy Ghost that's the one we
[38:58] want more than anything we want the gift
[39:00] of the Holy Ghost he's going to give it
[39:02] to us drive the unclean Spirit out and
[39:04] seal the thing up
[39:06] so Satan can't get in and God can't even
[39:09] get out but you know what he's doing
[39:10] he's he's trying to work because you
[39:13] still got
[39:15] the spirit man
[39:16] to work with
[39:18] so now as the unclean spirit's gone out
[39:21] of this man we don't have to worry about
[39:22] this man being unclean anymore
[39:25] we have to worry about this one because
[39:28] this is your Battleground now
[39:30] and why is it a Battleground this is now
[39:33] fighting this when you were not born
[39:35] again this all was devil
[39:41] this all was devil so the devil ain't
[39:45] gonna fight himself
[39:47] but when you put the Holy Ghost in here
[39:49] that's his one sworn enemy Satan has no
[39:52] other enemy but God
[39:54] you're not Satan's enemy God is Satan's
[39:56] enemy
[39:58] and vice versa
[40:00] you're not God's enemy
[40:03] Satan is God's enemy but if you keep him
[40:05] inside here you become an enemy of God
[40:08] that's what the Bible says so now the
[40:10] unclean spirit's gone out
[40:12] walks in dry Place seeks rest finest
[40:14] none comes back and sees the house swept
[40:17] and garnished
[40:19] and unless you fill it back up with the
[40:22] Holy Ghost you got to be filled with
[40:23] something
[40:24] you can't be wishy-washy you can't be
[40:27] half that's why brother Brown said Faith
[40:28] or doubt not faith and doubt
[40:31] anybody with me Faith or doubt all right
[40:35] so that's in your soul that's the center
[40:37] realm listen that is what's going to be
[40:41] judged your body is not going to be
[40:44] judged your spirit's not going to be
[40:46] judged the soul of man is what's going
[40:49] to be judged at the white Throne
[40:51] judgment The Souls of man the Bible says
[40:53] will have to give an account
[40:55] and praise God you know what if we get
[40:57] the soul of God inside of us it's
[40:59] already given account
[41:01] it's already cleaned and set aside for
[41:03] sure it's already done that's why
[41:05] brother Brown could say we're The
[41:07] Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[41:10] it transforming you into what a new
[41:12] creation a new person
[41:15] the old done away behold all things
[41:19] become new but
[41:21] we still live in this world
[41:23] of this guy right here
[41:26] the spirit man
[41:28] which is I say memory reason conscious
[41:32] affectionate imagination
[41:34] that's now has become the Battleground
[41:40] and that part is where we've got to get
[41:42] that unclean Spirit drove out of that
[41:44] part
[41:46] anybody with me all right so it's not
[41:48] just one and done
[41:52] praise God I got born again now you're
[41:54] just going to take the baby and throw it
[41:55] in the closet
[41:57] no you got to feed it
[41:59] and you gotta feed it what the word of
[42:01] God now not the other junk of the world
[42:03] we feed it the word of God and that's
[42:05] what we're doing now going up the statue
[42:07] of perfect man there's as brother Ryan
[42:09] tells his sister Shepherd's dream that
[42:12] there's rocks and sticks
[42:14] all right look it and and he said well
[42:17] sister Shepard was asking was she born
[42:19] again he said yes you're born again in
[42:21] other words he was telling her don't
[42:22] worry about that part which is right
[42:23] here but she was standing in what five
[42:27] streams of water
[42:33] that was flowing out of her person not
[42:37] here here
[42:39] come on
[42:40] not here here
[42:42] and showing her that she was born again
[42:44] but she still had what sticks
[42:47] and rocks
[42:49] that's what we're talking about we're
[42:51] not talking about sanctification Lord
[42:53] clean me up so I can be born again I
[42:55] hope
[42:56] that if you're going up the statue of
[42:59] perfect man you have to get past that
[43:02] Clyde spent so much time on the
[43:04] foundation
[43:06] you got to be born again without even
[43:08] because look if you're not born again
[43:10] every one of these will fool you also
[43:15] don't worry about these right here
[43:17] these are just Outlets to let this work
[43:20] out
[43:21] everybody with me all right but right
[43:24] here's what we got to worry about
[43:27] this imagination conscious memory reason
[43:30] and affection
[43:31] which is the Battleground
[43:33] Satan's going this way trying to fight
[43:35] get back in God's trying to fight to get
[43:37] out that's why we're brother Wayne was
[43:39] talking about grave clothes listen we're
[43:41] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[43:43] right here
[43:44] hey man
[43:46] but we still got grave clothes on
[43:49] I hope can I tap that is that going to
[43:51] break it or
[43:54] I can't see Joe I hope he's not going I
[43:56] don't touch that
[43:57] because every time I tap it it makes a
[43:58] difference it looks a little color right
[44:00] here
[44:00] I'm sorry so anyway so you got this
[44:02] right here you got the holy of holies if
[44:04] you're born again you don't have to
[44:05] worry about that let that work its way
[44:07] out
[44:10] a new creation
[44:12] let that unclean Spirit go out of that
[44:15] part of you
[44:16] and let what let God now start
[44:20] okay
[44:22] circumcising
[44:25] not your soul
[44:27] circumcising the next part
[44:31] the memory reason conscious affection
[44:37] you remember
[44:41] probably not going to get to the rest of
[44:42] this but we're going to go this way
[44:45] you remember the children of Israel
[44:48] they came out of Egypt
[44:50] right
[44:51] they journeyed in the wilderness of what
[44:54] sin
[44:55] okay right they come over
[45:00] they come out
[45:03] then they got to Jordan right they're by
[45:05] with me they got to Jordan
[45:08] when they crossed over that was their
[45:10] new birth they crossed over washed their
[45:13] old past away everybody with me
[45:16] but remember when they stepped into that
[45:18] new land as brother Wayne was talking
[45:21] about the old corn of the land they ate
[45:24] not that Mana anymore but also they were
[45:27] what circumcised
[45:30] circumcised means the baptism of the
[45:32] Holy Ghost now why do you need two
[45:34] fillings
[45:36] in type
[45:37] they came out they went through the
[45:39] Wilderness Sanctified you know what he'd
[45:41] done he got rid of all them old Fighters
[45:42] and remember there was two people left
[45:44] Joshua and Caleb
[45:45] all right then they get to the promised
[45:48] land and
[45:49] God says hold on a man
[45:52] we got another little thing we got to do
[45:54] here
[45:54] y'all uh y'all made it through the
[45:57] Wilderness just fine
[45:59] but now you're into what Promised Land
[46:02] now you're in the promised land now the
[46:04] old corn of the land which is what
[46:06] mature
[46:07] come on people do not get that one of
[46:09] these they they're not eating Manna God
[46:11] is going to feed you but there's a day
[46:13] when God's going to say there's corn in
[46:16] this land that's now mature you don't
[46:18] eat corn in the stock you don't eat corn
[46:21] when it's about that big make you sick
[46:23] as a dog but you can eat corn when it's
[46:25] on when it's got fully matured ears you
[46:28] can shuck that baby back and eat it all
[46:30] day long but what has it done it's
[46:32] matured and when you eat mature
[46:34] you become mature you are truly we are
[46:38] what we eat
[46:40] not just this
[46:42] we are what we eat in the gospel and the
[46:44] world and all the different things
[46:45] everybody with me on this
[46:48] so your soul if it's born again tonight
[46:51] it is trying its best to work its way
[46:55] out
[46:56] into the imagination conscious memories
[46:58] and affection the Little Devils
[47:00] so now unclean Spirit goes out of what
[47:03] goes out of now in our spirit Realm
[47:09] remember the old
[47:11] Indian had no problem when he was when
[47:15] he not born again
[47:17] like he said he said Chief now has two
[47:21] dogs
[47:22] okay when you were not born again when
[47:25] you were out in the world you were a dog
[47:26] from here to there
[47:30] and everything in between
[47:32] but when you got the Holy Ghost
[47:35] you had so much of an of a nature of
[47:37] this world till it's all got to be
[47:40] contrary to the devil the devil is
[47:42] contrary to everything that you are now
[47:44] and when you go up to the Statue of
[47:46] perfect man it's going to be even more
[47:48] that you're going to have to fight for
[47:51] every inch of ground greatest battle
[47:52] ever fought
[47:54] it's not in your soul if you're born
[47:56] again that battle is over
[47:59] step into the Promised Land
[48:01] and take what's yours which is what
[48:03] these promises of Faith virtue and all
[48:05] his temper's patience godliness and
[48:07] brotherly kindness
[48:10] a kind of uh got a chance to talk to
[48:13] brother Wayne about that and he may be
[48:15] watching in I don't know but still I
[48:17] told him I said you know you realize
[48:18] facing on an ad
[48:19] and he just looked at me kind of strange
[48:21] he kind of said
[48:23] I said show me the Bible where it says
[48:28] add to your face
[48:31] faith is a new birth because listen
[48:32] there's only seven ads we've been
[48:34] through this don't look at me crazy
[48:37] for those new ones maybe you can look at
[48:38] me a little crazy but look if you take
[48:41] and keep Faith here one two three four
[48:43] five six seven eight there's not eight
[48:45] ads there's seven
[48:47] add to your new birth one two three four
[48:50] five six seven
[48:53] that makes it right
[48:55] it's my faith now add to my faith virtue
[49:00] so maybe we can say a few things maybe
[49:02] that
[49:03] don't think we
[49:05] I'm not very smart around here sometimes
[49:06] we can confound the wise
[49:09] by just little things you say but it's
[49:10] it's terminology
[49:12] but it's the truth though because
[49:14] Faith's not an ad
[49:15] you add to your faith you add to your
[49:18] new birth your new birth listen if you
[49:20] get born again and never go up that
[49:22] pyramid you still gonna have little
[49:24] small nuggets of that
[49:26] cholesterol inside of you everything you
[49:28] need for your journey what the prophet
[49:30] say is right here
[49:33] all right
[49:34] you've just gotta do what let it out
[49:37] have you ever heard that before
[49:39] let it out
[49:42] so what about all these virtues
[49:45] watch neither did the poll have any
[49:47] virtue in it not a bit in other words
[49:49] this word has no virtue in it
[49:52] if you make it of none effect
[49:55] you by your Traditions make this what
[49:59] Paul said what the letter killeth
[50:02] but the spirit
[50:04] give his life
[50:06] but it was obeying what God Said do is
[50:09] what brought the power what brought the
[50:11] virtue is obedience
[50:13] to the word of God
[50:15] so if you're not born again tonight no
[50:17] one thinks for sure
[50:18] you're lost
[50:23] now you can be in a journey of
[50:24] justification and sanctification don't
[50:26] stop
[50:27] don't keep going because you know what
[50:29] that unclean spirit that comes out of
[50:31] you is going to walk back walk back in
[50:33] so bad
[50:35] because he was comfortable there
[50:37] everybody with me on this it was
[50:39] comfortable for me to go to a bar I
[50:41] didn't go to many but I did sorry it was
[50:43] BC
[50:45] but you know why because that's what was
[50:47] pulling me inside was that thing inside
[50:49] of me that did not want to do right
[50:53] I didn't want to come to church
[50:58] maybe I'm the only one
[51:02] I didn't want to that inside of me
[51:04] didn't want to
[51:07] but one day the seed word that was in
[51:10] the mind of God found me and said hey
[51:16] I've had enough for you
[51:20] and I hope you've had enough of him the
[51:22] devil
[51:23] and I did I said Lord I've had enough of
[51:26] this tired of running
[51:30] if you've never experienced that you
[51:31] need to
[51:33] and man you need to experience that
[51:37] we sing the song the things I do I do no
[51:39] more and all that it's a it's a it's a
[51:42] For Real Thing the things I used to do I
[51:44] don't do them anymore
[51:46] first Samuel 15 says Samuel was talking
[51:48] about
[51:50] um
[51:51] Saul says that the Lord is great delight
[51:54] and burn offerings and sacrifices it
[51:55] doesn't obeying the voice of the Lord
[51:57] there's a lot of people and I'll read
[51:58] you a quote probably Sunday brother
[52:00] Brian said there's a lot of people in
[52:01] the world natural people they have part
[52:03] of these virtues but they're not
[52:04] god-given they're nature given
[52:08] you you've seen people there's some
[52:10] people in the world that you work with
[52:11] or you're acquainted with or even if
[52:13] you're friends with that you could slap
[52:15] them and knock them over into into a
[52:17] wall and they just say thank you buddy
[52:19] especially if y'all been drinking
[52:20] together
[52:23] but you they certain people you don't
[52:26] touch
[52:28] and you know that right
[52:31] you don't even look in their Direction
[52:34] well that's just people and nature
[52:39] but if you'll get both unborn again
[52:42] where's the ups and downs it's not there
[52:44] anymore
[52:45] so behold the obey is better than
[52:47] sacrifice in other words what are you
[52:49] saying by the way I'm coming back to
[52:51] this because it cost Saul his kingdom
[52:56] it costs saw the Kingdom of Israel
[52:59] whether he wasn't supposed to be king or
[53:01] not he was King the people made him a
[53:05] king and God accepted it at the moment
[53:07] but he said Saul
[53:09] the kingdom been rent from you just
[53:11] because of one thing
[53:15] you didn't obey what your Prophet said
[53:18] oh come on somebody
[53:20] you didn't you didn't do what your
[53:22] Prophet said your Prophet said Kill Them
[53:24] All
[53:26] obey is better than sacrifice to hearken
[53:29] than the fat of realms
[53:31] oh listen read in your Bible Saul
[53:34] preached a pretty good sermon
[53:35] hey we saved this King so we can maybe
[53:37] convert him and we saved all these Rams
[53:40] so we can sacrifice them to the Lord
[53:41] that didn't mean one thing to God
[53:43] because he had said something through
[53:45] the prophet and he didn't do it so it
[53:47] didn't matter about that for Rebellion
[53:49] as as the sin of witchcraft
[53:52] and stubbornness is as iniquity
[53:55] and idolatry
[53:58] that's pretty rough
[54:00] the brother mom tells us we're not
[54:01] building an organization
[54:03] not here this morning building an
[54:04] organization we're not trying to build
[54:05] an organization here
[54:07] we're trying to build individuals
[54:10] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[54:12] the statue of Jesus Christ that they
[54:13] might be the what the PowerHouse and the
[54:16] dwelling place of the Spirit by his word
[54:18] by his words he built up the individual
[54:21] to that place and it all starts with
[54:23] virtue the whole multitude started to
[54:25] touch him why they want to touch him why
[54:28] didn't they want to teach a touch a
[54:29] Roman soldier why didn't they want to
[54:30] touch Caiaphas
[54:32] you ever thought about that catfish was
[54:34] the man of the hour Caiaphas was their
[54:36] preacher
[54:38] Tapas was their pastor
[54:40] they relied on Caiaphas to go once a
[54:43] year behind the holy of holies and not
[54:45] die self and to give what to give a
[54:48] sacrifice for the whole country of
[54:51] Israel
[54:52] they depended on him
[54:54] but did they go right into him when they
[54:56] needed something that's what made him
[54:58] mad
[54:59] that's what made Compass mad they run
[55:02] right by Caiaphas to get to Jesus
[55:04] and that what righteous indignation
[55:07] because his soul was black as such
[55:11] but he kept every ordinance
[55:14] heaven and waving and cutting and
[55:17] chopping and killing this one and and
[55:20] taking this one you know and taking the
[55:21] blood and going behind the the holy of
[55:23] holy seems like he lived a pretty good
[55:25] life
[55:28] but in the end he turned the word down
[55:33] because where was the word
[55:35] in flesh
[55:39] Jesus said you would have had a cloak if
[55:41] I hadn't to come in other words you
[55:43] would have had the Old Testament as long
[55:45] as you didn't touch a woman you didn't
[55:47] commit adultery with her right that was
[55:49] what the Old Testament didn't say about
[55:50] looking or or thinking
[55:52] but Jesus said now I say unto you
[55:55] that if you look on a woman to lust
[55:57] after in your heart you've committed
[55:59] adultery with her already and they
[56:00] didn't like that because they had been
[56:02] doing it all their life
[56:07] virtue anyone knows that the word virtue
[56:09] means what
[56:10] we must have and we must have it if
[56:13] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[56:14] that was sick he's expecting the same
[56:16] virtue in his church now where's that
[56:18] virtue going to come from that Center
[56:19] that Center person the central realm all
[56:22] right because you know what that's God
[56:23] in there brother Robert said you and God
[56:25] is persons the only two times he used
[56:27] the word vulcanized was two times I
[56:29] think in the whole
[56:30] um
[56:31] 1100 something sermons but it was very
[56:34] profound because what is vulcanization
[56:37] Jonas you don't know what that is do you
[56:39] buddy he when Jonas don't understand
[56:41] something his eyebrows go together
[56:43] and that's okay
[56:45] because when we had bicycles
[56:49] yeah we had bicycles that we fixed we
[56:52] didn't take them to a bike town and have
[56:53] them fix it for us everybody with me on
[56:56] that hey man we put our own handlebars
[56:59] on it we put our own
[57:01] we put our own patches on patches
[57:04] but what is vulcanization is taking
[57:05] something that's rubber
[57:07] and taking a rubber tube and if there's
[57:09] a hole in it she's riding down a dirt
[57:11] road and right at the if you hit a rock
[57:13] just right in the side we all know this
[57:16] those of us are Road Bicycles
[57:18] it would puncture that tube and just
[57:20] knock a little hole in it and down it
[57:23] went
[57:23] well Dad would go and he'd go up to the
[57:26] store and he'd buy a little patch kit or
[57:28] you know what sometimes if he could find
[57:30] the glue he made his own patch out of
[57:33] what another piece of rubber
[57:36] so that word vulcanization means that
[57:38] you take two pieces you take Rubber and
[57:40] rubber and what you would do would you
[57:42] did you just didn't just you'd clean it
[57:44] off don't you look don't you clean it
[57:46] off
[57:46] real good kind of score it a little bit
[57:49] because what you were going to do was
[57:51] take a same piece of rubber
[57:54] and try to get it to stick on there so
[57:56] the air wouldn't come out of it
[57:58] well what you did you didn't just depend
[58:00] on the glue
[58:02] come on somebody this is good I hope
[58:04] this helps it's not just the glue that
[58:06] we depend on
[58:08] that glue may be a spot dad used to take
[58:11] that man he just brushing on I thought
[58:13] that thing will never
[58:14] never leak again
[58:17] but he takes it out of his pocket or he
[58:19] goes in the house and gets him a gets
[58:21] him a lighter or gets him a match and he
[58:23] and he hits that thing and when he hits
[58:25] it it starts flaming
[58:28] it gets that rubber just hot enough
[58:30] right before it melts all down to
[58:32] nothing and he slaps that other patch on
[58:34] it what'd it do it made both of them
[58:37] patches one of the patch in the tube it
[58:40] made it one
[58:41] come on somebody
[58:43] same way with me and you
[58:46] I and my father are one
[58:49] one pack Hey listen
[58:51] listen stop
[58:53] but listen if God himself patched us up
[58:56] it's rubber to rubber
[59:02] tough crowd on Wednesday night y'all
[59:03] need sleeping about an hour or two
[59:05] before you come to church
[59:08] foreign
[59:12] virtue in his church what rubber to
[59:14] rubber but now see Jonas you couldn't
[59:16] took a piece of wood
[59:18] could have took a piece of wood in a
[59:19] tire tube that's rubber you that
[59:21] whatever you did it didn't matter that
[59:24] would not stick together but if you took
[59:27] and vulcanized and heated up this Rubber
[59:30] and heated up this Rubber and put enough
[59:32] glue around it and you slapped it on
[59:33] there when it cooled off you could not
[59:35] pull that patch off y'all remember you
[59:37] can't pull the patch off
[59:39] and that's why I want him when I was
[59:40] going down the road about 20 miles an
[59:42] hour on the bicycle I didn't want
[59:43] another hole in my tire
[59:44] in the in life I didn't want to go down
[59:46] the road of life and then all of a
[59:48] sudden have a flat
[59:49] but if you vulcanize to the right person
[59:54] and if he had virtue to give to the
[59:55] people he expects us to have virtue to
[59:58] give to a people and what is virtue
[1:00:00] virtue is strength and power remember we
[1:00:02] read the quote the other day where
[1:00:04] brother Brown said we got to have virtue
[1:00:06] for the whole world
[1:00:08] this whole world today I declare to you
[1:00:11] today 2023 January the fourth this world
[1:00:14] is only held together by the bride it is
[1:00:18] not held together by gold it is not held
[1:00:20] together by Putin it is not held
[1:00:22] together by
[1:00:24] that other guy we have
[1:00:26] and it's not held together by none of
[1:00:28] that it's not held together by economy
[1:00:33] it's held together by the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:34] Christ still being here to come to
[1:00:36] maturity listen the plan as brother
[1:00:38] Wayne was talking about the chief wave
[1:00:40] we haven't all come to maturity yet
[1:00:42] there's some that maybe have but you're
[1:00:44] not going to go out there just because
[1:00:45] one comes to maturity and just cut the
[1:00:47] whole field down
[1:00:48] you wait it's showing that someone has
[1:00:51] come to maturity but he's waiting on the
[1:00:54] whole field to what well as we say in in
[1:00:56] in in our terminology of Garner waiting
[1:00:59] for it to head out
[1:01:01] because when it heads out it makes the
[1:01:03] same seed as you put in the ground amen
[1:01:05] and that you know what brother Brown
[1:01:06] said we're not to shut we're not to
[1:01:08] stalk
[1:01:10] we're not the tassel
[1:01:12] we're the seed
[1:01:14] where what was winning the ground what
[1:01:15] and the only seed is Jesus Christ it's
[1:01:18] not me and you we were born by
[1:01:19] corruptable seed
[1:01:21] but by the transforming Power by
[1:01:23] vulcanization he took that old nature
[1:01:26] that old sea that you were
[1:01:29] animated wheat germ out of it
[1:01:32] I read that quote in just a minute
[1:01:35] before you can forget about virtue you
[1:01:37] have to have it so add that
[1:01:40] to your faith virtue understand remember
[1:01:42] she didn't touch him physically talking
[1:01:44] about the woman who touched His Garment
[1:01:46] she touched His Garment but she pulled
[1:01:48] out what she needed listen she may have
[1:01:50] needed some money
[1:01:52] because for 12 years she couldn't work
[1:01:54] for 12 years she couldn't go anywhere
[1:01:56] she was totally unclean if your sisters
[1:01:59] know what I'm talking about in the Old
[1:02:00] Testament if you if you were on your
[1:02:02] monthly cycle you were unclean you
[1:02:03] couldn't be touched your husband
[1:02:04] couldn't touch you you couldn't go into
[1:02:06] Market you couldn't go into this Temple
[1:02:08] for sure
[1:02:10] then when you were took the cleansing of
[1:02:13] the seven days later you could go and
[1:02:14] you know your natural life will continue
[1:02:16] on but this lady had been 12 years every
[1:02:18] day
[1:02:20] she was probably anemic
[1:02:22] probably couldn't hardly walk because of
[1:02:24] her blood loss
[1:02:26] but she pulled one thing she needed to
[1:02:28] be healed
[1:02:30] she didn't need a new car
[1:02:32] she didn't need a new leg
[1:02:34] she didn't need for the Lord to give her
[1:02:36] extra money she needed that blood to
[1:02:39] stop
[1:02:40] so whatever issue you have
[1:02:43] asked the Lord to stop it
[1:02:45] touch His Garment one time and let's see
[1:02:47] if we can get all this stuff stopped and
[1:02:49] get everything pulled back into the
[1:02:51] right direction because the word pull
[1:02:53] rin tear perform carry out look to draw
[1:02:56] the supporter attention of that's why
[1:02:58] attract the third pull brother around
[1:03:00] the three poles was what to attract the
[1:03:02] attention of the people
[1:03:06] and what were the three poles one was
[1:03:08] the what in the hand
[1:03:12] watch this pull my pull the chart back
[1:03:14] up here please if I don't get any
[1:03:16] further than this that's okay we got
[1:03:17] next Sunday
[1:03:18] pull my chart back up please
[1:03:21] because Bob preached on this a long time
[1:03:23] ago and so did I about the three pulls
[1:03:26] of your journey and it's in that if you
[1:03:27] can see it and all that and all that
[1:03:29] going on you got the third pole second
[1:03:31] pull first pull what was the first pull
[1:03:36] foreign
[1:03:42] here see see this
[1:03:46] see this if there's no bumps you're
[1:03:49] healed he'd say look lady
[1:03:51] you still got that
[1:03:53] then he'll talk to us about five more
[1:03:55] minutes and then he'll say oh look lady
[1:03:58] it's gone
[1:04:00] flesh you can see it
[1:04:03] but now what was the next pull the
[1:04:06] second pull was what discernment
[1:04:09] pulled out of you what you were here
[1:04:14] and the third poll was when he looked
[1:04:16] right down in the opening of the word
[1:04:18] because you know what there was a lot of
[1:04:19] people got healed in the spirit realm
[1:04:21] that didn't get healed in the soul
[1:04:26] you know brother brown one time he's
[1:04:28] talking one he said oh I see you're a
[1:04:30] Christian so you know what that inside
[1:04:32] person was comfortable with him
[1:04:35] but he then there would be another one
[1:04:36] walk up and he'd say oh you've got uh
[1:04:39] capturing your lung he said but if
[1:04:42] you'll quit smoking and give your heart
[1:04:43] to God now what was he looking at he
[1:04:45] wasn't looking in these two Realms right
[1:04:47] here
[1:04:48] he was looking right there he was in
[1:04:51] that guy's throne room
[1:04:53] he was saying you need the new birth
[1:04:55] he said if you'll go confess your sins
[1:04:58] to God he said you'll get better
[1:05:00] discernment pulled out the virtues
[1:05:03] sanctification what was he doing
[1:05:06] he was literally
[1:05:08] if he was
[1:05:11] brother Danny if he would have stayed
[1:05:12] here another 50 years
[1:05:14] he'd have cleaned the world up
[1:05:17] think about it
[1:05:21] 25
[1:05:22] 000 outstanding miracles in one service
[1:05:25] one service if he'd still be living
[1:05:27] today it'd be 100 something years old
[1:05:29] but think about if he stayed here what
[1:05:31] kind of an impact he would have had on
[1:05:32] the whole world they'd have to do away
[1:05:34] with the medical field
[1:05:36] what was he doing he was cleaning them
[1:05:38] up so that he could what preach to their
[1:05:41] soul
[1:05:42] so that third pull is what the opening
[1:05:44] of the word the opening of the word is
[1:05:47] not here
[1:05:50] the opening of the word is here look
[1:05:52] word revealed
[1:05:54] yeah you can get pieces
[1:05:58] as the foolish version will get pieces
[1:06:01] of Revelation but never have God in
[1:06:04] their Throne Room they've never come to
[1:06:06] the son of man Revelation or the opening
[1:06:09] of the word
[1:06:11] so you got your
[1:06:12] hand
[1:06:14] discernment
[1:06:15] and then you've got the inner Court the
[1:06:18] opening of the word there's only one
[1:06:20] place listen brother Branham had to come
[1:06:22] to a place before he could open the word
[1:06:24] to us
[1:06:26] Revelations 5 the book was closed
[1:06:31] Revelations 10 the book was open
[1:06:34] there had to be a place to where that
[1:06:35] book opened up
[1:06:43] everybody all right
[1:06:45] then he's talking about the disciples
[1:06:46] about how turning our hearts back to the
[1:06:48] face of the fathers if you want to know
[1:06:50] how to act read the book of Acts that's
[1:06:52] what that means acts of the apostle
[1:06:54] how could they know it was a nod from
[1:06:56] God they had all these virtues in here
[1:06:59] all of these qualifications
[1:07:02] all right so that we talk about us being
[1:07:05] a special group of people and how that
[1:07:06] we're prophetic people and how that
[1:07:08] we're an open book people they weren't
[1:07:14] they didn't have the seals open to them
[1:07:15] they didn't know when he said I'm the
[1:07:17] son of man they didn't know who he was
[1:07:19] they knew he was the son of God they
[1:07:21] knew he was God and that had come down
[1:07:23] somehow in some form but he they didn't
[1:07:25] have a son of man revelation
[1:07:27] but yet they had what are you saying by
[1:07:30] the way you can have these virtues and
[1:07:31] not have the son of man Revelation so
[1:07:33] that's the Son of God brother Wayne was
[1:07:35] touched you know that's the Son of God
[1:07:36] Revelation down through the church age
[1:07:37] it's not son of man
[1:07:39] Son of God was trying to get us back to
[1:07:41] the verses what faith of the fathers
[1:07:44] that'd be all right
[1:07:46] and the first little knot of God
[1:07:48] compared with every bit of this and with
[1:07:50] his word they knowed it was the word of
[1:07:52] God listen they didn't even have a Bible
[1:07:59] they were writing it
[1:08:01] as they were talking
[1:08:04] they were a living breathing word of God
[1:08:08] you and I need to get back to a living
[1:08:10] breathing word of God
[1:08:13] they knowed it was the word of God and
[1:08:17] nothing when God spoke they went they
[1:08:20] were taught by the word himself then
[1:08:22] we're talking about we'll just kind of
[1:08:23] skip through this I want to cover this
[1:08:25] again next week about the horse riders
[1:08:27] let's just get through that for time was
[1:08:28] 20 after eight
[1:08:31] uh
[1:08:32] and he talks about latest what we just
[1:08:34] been talking about in Revelations 2
[1:08:36] verse 4 he's talking about the Ephesian
[1:08:37] churches he said I have somewhat against
[1:08:39] him because thou has left thy first love
[1:08:43] I mean the first three ages man that it
[1:08:45] was powerful in the first there was no
[1:08:47] denominational idea there was no we
[1:08:49] think Jesus might be God we think we
[1:08:52] need to baptize father son Holy Ghost no
[1:08:54] they knew how to baptize they knew that
[1:08:56] God in Christ were one but serenthius
[1:08:59] and all the different ones started
[1:09:01] coming in saying well maybe he's like
[1:09:02] substance he can't be all of God we saw
[1:09:05] him throw up one day he was sick he fell
[1:09:08] and broke his leg broke his leg but
[1:09:10] failing skin his knee that can't be God
[1:09:13] and then that what that steamrolled
[1:09:16] remember therefore from Wednesday our
[1:09:18] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:09:20] that's what brother Brandon was trying
[1:09:22] to get us to do get back to the first
[1:09:24] works
[1:09:25] all right
[1:09:27] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:09:29] and will remove your Candlestick out of
[1:09:31] his place except thou repent
[1:09:33] but this thou has that thou hate us the
[1:09:36] Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also
[1:09:38] hate which is that what tree of
[1:09:40] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:09:41] he didn't have to nearly let him hear
[1:09:43] what the spirit says to the churches to
[1:09:44] him that overcometh so it's got to be an
[1:09:46] overcoming with the true power of God
[1:09:48] because we know we're going to look at a
[1:09:51] false power
[1:09:52] Sunday because we have the knowledge of
[1:09:54] Good and Evil we have the tree of life
[1:09:56] we have two trees all right
[1:09:59] let's look at this just for a moment now
[1:10:02] remember we're going to interpolate a
[1:10:04] little bit in just for a few minutes
[1:10:06] proverbs 31 10. I told you before uh
[1:10:10] historians if you go back and read in
[1:10:11] the history this is Solomon right in
[1:10:14] Proverbs right
[1:10:16] and he's writing about his mama
[1:10:19] Bathsheba
[1:10:21] who can find a virtuous woman for her
[1:10:25] price is far above rubies now here's a
[1:10:27] man that was a multi in in today's money
[1:10:31] he was a multi he was in the trillions
[1:10:33] of dollars that he owned
[1:10:36] Solomon was
[1:10:37] trillions of dollars he had gold he just
[1:10:40] had to throw away
[1:10:43] but he said a virtuous woman
[1:10:46] it's way way past that
[1:10:49] a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[1:10:52] husband
[1:10:55] who's our husband
[1:10:58] I got a husband
[1:11:01] you've got a husband
[1:11:03] it's Jesus Christ
[1:11:05] and we're we're not only going to Crown
[1:11:08] Him king of kings and Lord of lords we
[1:11:10] are his crown
[1:11:12] brother Bob said we're his victory
[1:11:14] without us
[1:11:16] who's going to prove the resurrection
[1:11:19] the devil no no the devil got into them
[1:11:22] got into Caiaphas and them said oh hey
[1:11:24] took his body out and throwed it
[1:11:25] somewhere and and you know they they
[1:11:27] stole his body and then they ate him
[1:11:29] because he said eat my flesh and drink
[1:11:30] my blood
[1:11:31] but a virtuous woman a virtuous bride
[1:11:34] let's put that in there The Virtuous
[1:11:36] bride of Christ is a crown to her
[1:11:37] husband but she didn't maketh ashamed of
[1:11:40] those rottenness in his bones that's a
[1:11:42] denominational world
[1:11:44] they make God ashamed people
[1:11:47] they make me ashamed by the way they
[1:11:49] walk into their churches by the way they
[1:11:50] treat their churches they treat them
[1:11:52] just like brother Brown said they're
[1:11:53] lodges that's the way they treat them
[1:11:55] they treat it just like a meat and joint
[1:11:57] for you go to and and and be able to
[1:12:00] talk about first one thing or another
[1:12:01] and then sit down for a few minutes and
[1:12:03] listen to a preacher I had my cousin
[1:12:05] today Terry Dale I'm calling his name
[1:12:07] because he's probably he said he was
[1:12:08] going to be here Sunday but he's a
[1:12:10] singer and uh
[1:12:13] he said he was going to come and
[1:12:15] I told him I said he said what time
[1:12:16] y'all start I said I'm 45.
[1:12:19] preaching
[1:12:21] I said no we have Bible study or our
[1:12:23] Sunday school class he said when's
[1:12:25] preaching start I said well about 10 20
[1:12:28] I mean 10 40. we start preaching he said
[1:12:31] what time do you get finished I said ah
[1:12:33] about 12.
[1:12:35] earned 20 minutes
[1:12:38] I said yeah and I could go further than
[1:12:41] that
[1:12:43] hour and 20 minutes he said well I think
[1:12:45] I'll just come he said now what
[1:12:48] he's our cousin you can pick your
[1:12:51] friends but you can't pick your family
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:54] he said well he said well what if I come
[1:12:57] in at 11. how much am I going to miss of
[1:13:01] your sermon
[1:13:05] that's their mentality they only want a
[1:13:07] certain amount and that's it
[1:13:10] the only one that's certain they're only
[1:13:11] going to get their little 20-minute feel
[1:13:13] good service and then how long do y'all
[1:13:15] sing he says because he's a singer
[1:13:17] I said well now we start singing about
[1:13:19] 10 15 he said I'd like to hear y'all
[1:13:21] sing I said well you're gonna have to
[1:13:22] endure for about two hours then
[1:13:24] from 10 15 to 12. I said because I
[1:13:27] preach after that
[1:13:28] he said I'd like to hear you singing
[1:13:31] see what I mean
[1:13:33] they've diverted everything away from
[1:13:35] the word of God
[1:13:37] to their own pleasure
[1:13:40] pleasure me
[1:13:41] but don't pleasure me but about 20
[1:13:43] minutes
[1:13:46] they said three hours and watch a
[1:13:47] football game and never move well they
[1:13:49] move all right
[1:13:51] yeah they move that's for sure so let's
[1:13:53] read this right here just real quick and
[1:13:55] then we'll close a virtuous woman the
[1:13:57] bride of Christ may I interpolate that
[1:13:59] because this is not the Bible this is
[1:14:00] come from the internet so I'm not I'm
[1:14:02] not desecrating the word of God I'm not
[1:14:04] adding to it or taking from it I'm
[1:14:05] telling I'm telling you this is the
[1:14:07] story I get from this statement a
[1:14:10] virtuous woman the bride of Christ cares
[1:14:12] for her family
[1:14:15] family
[1:14:19] she is a hard worker
[1:14:22] this bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:24] while she toils Faithfully in meeting
[1:14:27] the needs of her own family
[1:14:29] she also doesn't forget to help the
[1:14:31] other needy people God sends to
[1:14:34] Nicaragua
[1:14:37] are the Philippines
[1:14:39] or Jamaica
[1:14:41] or Ireland or India
[1:14:46] a virtuous woman also takes the time to
[1:14:49] look after her own health
[1:14:55] hmm
[1:14:56] and be a good Steward of her body
[1:15:00] I'm pointing back here
[1:15:02] that's you that's not listen folks look
[1:15:04] this is not the congregation
[1:15:09] I just read you the quote it's
[1:15:11] individuals this is you or not you
[1:15:15] it's not you and your wife it's not you
[1:15:17] and your kids it's not you and your
[1:15:18] pastor it's you
[1:15:21] so a virtuous woman takes time to look
[1:15:23] after her own health
[1:15:26] I read my own Bible I don't depend on
[1:15:28] Bob to read the Bible for me
[1:15:31] of course some of y'all probably do you
[1:15:32] come to church on Sunday and you haven't
[1:15:34] read the Bible all week and you expect
[1:15:36] us to give you something
[1:15:37] well I'll preach anyhow
[1:15:40] so our virtuous bride of Christ
[1:15:43] meaning applies to the heart
[1:15:48] and then to every area
[1:15:52] of life
[1:15:53] memory reason conscious effects of
[1:15:55] imagination
[1:15:56] the bottom line is a virtuous woman the
[1:16:00] Bride of Jesus Christ goes in the
[1:16:02] strength of the Lord
[1:16:04] and Faithfully completes whatever task
[1:16:07] God has for her to do
[1:16:11] when a person is described as having
[1:16:13] virtue
[1:16:14] it is seen as a quality that sets one
[1:16:17] apart from everyone else look in
[1:16:20] character
[1:16:23] strength and morality
[1:16:27] people look at the morals of this world
[1:16:34] like I said before
[1:16:36] think about it when we get to Glory
[1:16:39] there's not gonna be cheaters there
[1:16:43] it's not gonna be any Liars there
[1:16:46] you know what they will be though there
[1:16:48] will be an economy
[1:16:53] there'll be rulers
[1:16:54] Kings there'll be Governors the Bible
[1:16:57] says the government will be on his
[1:16:59] shoulder
[1:17:02] but it won't be this messed up
[1:17:04] government we got now
[1:17:06] we're the only people that have any sort
[1:17:09] of morality
[1:17:10] it's just Katie bar the door right there
[1:17:13] folks
[1:17:14] it is a common characteristic look
[1:17:17] common
[1:17:18] characteristic that can be found within
[1:17:21] the mindset of several women in the
[1:17:23] Bible from Ruth to Esther to Mary as
[1:17:27] well as described of others through
[1:17:28] countless
[1:17:29] virtues verses The Virtuous person
[1:17:32] exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason
[1:17:34] and of character all right The Virtuous
[1:17:38] person The Virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ not only knows what the good
[1:17:42] thing to do is
[1:17:44] we've been taught what's good
[1:17:46] if you've got the new birth you will do
[1:17:48] what's good
[1:17:49] in your soul
[1:17:51] but now you might let that second guy
[1:17:54] remember the little thing that sits on
[1:17:55] your shoulder called the devil he don't
[1:17:57] leave when you get the new birth
[1:17:59] no he brings another friend and he sits
[1:18:01] on this side
[1:18:03] you look at me funny I'm the only one
[1:18:06] that has these problems I'm sometimes I
[1:18:08] just wonder y'all look at me like what
[1:18:09] are you talking about
[1:18:12] we're preachers but we're people
[1:18:17] and he's got his gun pointed on us
[1:18:19] before y'all sometimes
[1:18:21] because he knows what I'm going to
[1:18:23] preach before y'all do he feels the
[1:18:25] anointing he fails to pull
[1:18:27] The Virtuous bride of Christ not only
[1:18:29] knows what the good thing to do is he or
[1:18:32] she is emotionally attached some of
[1:18:34] y'all ought to be emotionally attached
[1:18:46] preach it brother
[1:18:50] go go
[1:18:53] that's what the world says can't we go
[1:18:58] we got gold Pride
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:07] all right musicians get ready to come on
[1:19:10] predestination looks back to
[1:19:11] foreknowledge I mean election election
[1:19:13] looks back to foreknowledge and
[1:19:15] predestination looks to Destiny when we
[1:19:17] get finished with this I'm gonna
[1:19:19] probably cover a little bit on
[1:19:20] predestination
[1:19:22] but it's very very simple
[1:19:26] if you'll understand
[1:19:28] predestination is very simple
[1:19:31] it just gets convoluted by other people
[1:19:34] remember the Common People heard him
[1:19:36] gladly
[1:19:38] it was the wise that was confounded
[1:19:41] but the ones that were wise in our own
[1:19:43] conceit were confounded and their own
[1:19:45] conceit don't forget that election looks
[1:19:48] back here here it is I was a kookaburra
[1:19:50] now how you gonna take this quote and
[1:19:52] make it match all the other quotes you
[1:19:54] got to understand what he's talking
[1:19:55] about
[1:19:56] yeah I was a cucumber
[1:20:00] in my throne room was the life of a
[1:20:03] kookaburra
[1:20:05] not wheat or when I sprang out out of
[1:20:08] produced wheat
[1:20:11] I didn't produce wheat
[1:20:13] I was a cucumber
[1:20:15] have you ever walked through the woods
[1:20:17] some of y'all ought to get out and walk
[1:20:18] through the woods and talk to God he's
[1:20:19] out there
[1:20:21] but you get these stains on your legs
[1:20:25] we used to call them well we come back
[1:20:27] alive it's actually beggar lives but we
[1:20:30] forget all the mother ours and E's and
[1:20:32] call it bigger lights right then yeah
[1:20:35] but big Elias had little things on it
[1:20:38] you know and that when you walk through
[1:20:40] and they'd just stick all over you we've
[1:20:42] had to walk too many times me and Dad
[1:20:43] went through we were somewhere hunting
[1:20:45] one time we got down finished and we got
[1:20:47] down to the car and from here down was
[1:20:50] nothing but
[1:20:51] that and some Kookaburras we had to take
[1:20:54] our knife and scrape that stuff off
[1:20:57] praise God we got it all scraped off I
[1:20:59] hope somebody's getting this thank God
[1:21:01] we got it all scraped off
[1:21:04] but the kookaburrence what we were and a
[1:21:07] kookaburra is not just one it's a bush
[1:21:09] of them you don't get just one color you
[1:21:12] get bunches
[1:21:13] I was a kookaburra what and you know
[1:21:15] what them things hurt
[1:21:18] if things hurt when you get them in the
[1:21:20] wrong place
[1:21:21] back your leg rear end and all that
[1:21:23] other stuff don't sit out on one
[1:21:26] well that's what it is in sand people
[1:21:28] that's exactly the way we were we were
[1:21:31] totally uncomfortable
[1:21:34] I was a kookaburra I was born in sin
[1:21:36] come on a musician I was shaping
[1:21:38] iniquity came to this world speaking
[1:21:41] lies born amongst Sinners this is the
[1:21:44] prophet telling us what he was
[1:21:46] I was a huckleber
[1:21:50] but all of a sudden
[1:21:52] may I interpolate by the transforming
[1:21:56] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:58] I became a weak grain
[1:22:01] now it didn't change the outside it
[1:22:04] still looked like a cucumber
[1:22:08] how did it happen what is it election
[1:22:11] God before the foundation of the world
[1:22:14] elected that that cuckoo were kookabur
[1:22:17] was to become a grain of wheat now I
[1:22:21] know I'm a grain of weed because I'm
[1:22:23] saved
[1:22:25] how do I do it look back and see that
[1:22:28] what he predestinated it
[1:22:31] not down here there
[1:22:33] thank God long time ago
[1:22:37] by foreknowledge he's saying that I
[1:22:40] would love him so he made a perpetuation
[1:22:42] what a way
[1:22:44] he made a way that he could break that
[1:22:46] cuckleberry open
[1:22:48] praise God
[1:22:49] and put weed life down in there and lock
[1:22:52] it back up but you know what if you
[1:22:53] plant it what is it going to bring
[1:22:55] wait
[1:22:57] because it's a life of the wheat inside
[1:22:59] you might have been born in sin born
[1:23:01] from your mom and daddy don't know who
[1:23:03] your mom and daddy is but I promise you
[1:23:05] you get baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:08] you'll bring forth wheat life
[1:23:10] no more kookaburra
[1:23:13] but now listen we're gonna have a sticky
[1:23:15] nature because remember that outside
[1:23:16] shell is still a kookaburra
[1:23:18] hello somebody brother Brown said this
[1:23:19] thing's going to be sticky to the change
[1:23:21] that's why we're trying our best to get
[1:23:23] through this statue of perfect man so
[1:23:25] that we'll have the knowledge of God not
[1:23:27] the knowledge of the world
[1:23:29] okay let's stand to our feet
[1:23:33] he made a perpetuation through his own
[1:23:35] son that through him I might because he
[1:23:37] looked through him not what
[1:23:40] that preacher did but through him
[1:23:42] through his own son
[1:23:45] that through him I might become from a
[1:23:47] kookaburra to a grain of wheat now where
[1:23:50] am I at where am I at I'm saved I'm
[1:23:53] walking in The Graces of God
[1:23:55] what does predestination look to Destiny
[1:23:58] where will he take me to and where am I

[1:25:56] linen is a righteousness wait a minute
[1:25:58] that's that say the righteousness of God

[1:26:10] it right out of the Bible
[1:26:12] and to her was granted that she should
[1:26:14] be arrayed and finally in a clean and
[1:26:16] white for the fine linen is the

[1:26:24] of you
[1:26:25] you have become righteous
[1:26:27] and now I want us to talk we're going to
[1:26:29] talk about knowledge Sunday I want you
[1:26:31] to know that
[1:26:33] knowledge is knowing
[1:26:35] brother Brown said knowing how to handle
[1:26:37] the word of God
[1:26:38] knowing what's right and what's wrong
[1:26:41] knowing when a false Doctrine
[1:26:43] is being preached let me read this one
[1:26:45] thing right here look at this knowledge
[1:26:47] signifies in general intelligence watch
[1:26:49] the general knowledge of Christian
[1:26:51] religion and the deeper look at this the
[1:26:54] deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:26:59] knowledge of this religion such
[1:27:02] as belongs to the more
[1:27:05] advanced
[1:27:08] not baby
[1:27:09] the more advanced especially if things
[1:27:13] lawful and unlawful for Christians moral
[1:27:16] wisdom such as this scene in right
[1:27:19] living let's sing a song God bless you
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:31] live
[1:27:38] the Bible tells me so
[1:27:43] his Souls have been his praise
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:28:09] whole greater is he that is in me that
[1:28:14] he that is
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:22] a rush in Mighty Wind
[1:28:27] blew into the upper room and baptize all
[1:28:34] of them
[1:28:36] with the power greater than any Earthly
[1:28:43] Soul foreign
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:29:42] flew into the upper room and baptized
[1:29:47] all of them white
[1:29:50] and with the power greater that's why
[1:29:58] Earthly foes you don't have to worry
[1:30:01] about Flesh and Blood I've got it right
[1:30:04] it's principalities and powers and evil
[1:30:07] spirits
[1:30:08] that's what we have to worry about
[1:30:14] greater is he that is in Me
[1:30:18] Greater is he landed in me that he that
[1:30:24] is in the world
[1:30:27] you believe that
[1:30:29] when that power comes into you it makes
[1:30:31] you an overcomer
[1:30:33] but he wants you to continue on not be a
[1:30:35] baby
[1:30:37] be an adult
[1:30:39] be able to I like that word advance
[1:30:44] I took Advanced Algebra I liked it
[1:30:47] because a lot of people didn't
[1:30:48] understand it but I did
[1:30:50] but I like when you say Advanced because
[1:30:53] you know what if you're advanced in God
[1:30:55] and your head blows up and you think you
[1:30:56] better somebody else you're not advanced
[1:30:58] in God you're advanced in the devil
[1:31:01] but when God Advance it doesn't advances
[1:31:03] you and places you it humbles you
[1:31:07] that God can give you a revelation that
[1:31:09] he give
[1:31:10] us Hey listen now the world there's
[1:31:11] eight billion people now it went to 8
[1:31:13] billion used to be seven for a long time

[1:31:17] 99.9 percent of that 8 billion people do
[1:31:20] not have what you have
[1:31:23] and never will have
[1:31:25] what you have tonight I want you to use
[1:31:28] that power use that power against the
[1:31:30] devil don't let him beat us down
[1:31:34] loose them and let them go we can walk
[1:31:36] in the word of God we can use our hands
[1:31:38] we can use our mouth and we can defeat
[1:31:41] the Devil I promise you he's defeated
[1:31:43] already he just don't know it but he's
[1:31:46] going to be defeated through the Bride
[1:31:47] of Jesus Christ it's going to be a woman
[1:31:49] that's going to whip him
[1:31:53] he thought he got a woman the weaker
[1:31:55] vessel in the Garden of Eden and he did
[1:31:58] this one's not gonna fall God's going to
[1:32:01] use this bride to defeat the Devil with
[1:32:03] oh thank God for that

[1:34:39] your prayer Pray for these things don't
[1:34:40] just do oh Lord another meeting well I
[1:34:42] like these meetings
[1:34:44] man I like these meetings because it
[1:34:46] gives it gives you some new some new
[1:34:48] avenues and and like I said I wrote a
[1:34:51] page and a half of notes just certain
[1:34:53] things that that you're you don't think
[1:34:55] about that somebody else thinks about
[1:34:56] it's very narrow-minded to think you
[1:34:59] don't listen to nobody and you just get
[1:35:00] it all yourself
[1:35:02] you can't do that
[1:35:04] Jesus you know what Jesus did
[1:35:08] the Bible said Angels Came and
[1:35:12] ministered to him when he was fixing to
[1:35:15] go to the cross and when he went to the
[1:35:18] Wilderness he said Angels Came and
[1:35:21] ministered to him and God had to send
[1:35:25] Elijah and
[1:35:30] now what the prophet said am I not
[1:35:32] quoting the prophet
[1:35:35] so we all need minister to be ministered
[1:35:37] to don't think we're on an island by
[1:35:39] ourselves we're not
[1:35:41] but I want you to let your light shine
[1:35:43] when you go somewhere or let your light
[1:35:45] shine when somebody comes here and wants
[1:35:47] to make sure they have a good time and
[1:35:48] make sure they're treated well and and
[1:35:50] pull on the gift of God and you'll get
[1:35:52] what you deserve
[1:35:53] you'll get what you want all right if
[1:35:55] you don't want anything you won't get
[1:35:56] anything if you want the will of God and
[1:35:58] the word of God you'll get it I promise
