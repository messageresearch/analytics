========================================

sorry never mind morning everyone good morning good to have each one of you here today good to see brother Isaac with us today from somewhere up in Tennessee close to Johnson City hope you're having the ball funny huh was funny that's his last name okay anyway right go thank you now everybody hello all right let's turn to Revelations 21 and what we're going to do this morning is just kind to wrap up our Sunday school class on the Millennium and the future home just for a recap uh before I forget it thanks brother Joe for taking over last Sunday did a marvelous job yeah so amen it's good that God can raise up people that can do things this is not easy is it no it Ain is it he said no I know I talking about him too it's not easy it takes up a little time so that's why being a pastor is a full-time job you try to get three sermons for a week you're you're doing a lot of thinking all right so what we were doing was is we were taking the Millennium and comparing it with the future home we know that Millennium is in time the future home is in eternity that's the two main differences uh the Millennium is still in the seventh day rest the future home is in an eighth day which is eternity all right uh on the throne in the Millennium Jesus will set on the throne as the son of David future home he'll be King Jesus and we're going to read it in a little bit um this is before the white Throne judgment there is still sin it's not on the Earth but it is still the devil's still alive and all of the demons are still alive they're just put in a holding place until the Judgment comes even the foolish virgin even the fisel Jew even all the people that died during the uh battle of Armageddon they're all waiting for judgment this is the temporary world not saying that this world will go away but what's on top of it is going to be temporary because the Bible says we'll build houses and inhabit them in the future home we're going to read right here John saw the city already coming down out of Heaven John 14 Jesus said I'll go to prepare a place for you it wasn't this place it was this place cuz Jesus went to prepare an eternal place all right so now this is the temporary City in the Millennium and Eternity is an eternal City it's the one Abraham was looking for this in the Millennium is going to be a honeymoon for the bride and and and the groom and the 144,000 is going to be our Eternal home in the future home this is still all temporary here because this is sin is still around it's not there but it's still around when we get over into here when we're talking about this right here you're going to see that everything is passed away everything's gone uh the Millennium just ushers right into the white Throne right there to the Battle of Magog where um sin is done away with actually sin is judged see sin is judged right here that's what the white Throne judgment is it judges sin and then one given it eternal life and the other one is given into the Lake of Fire uh that's not going to happen right here at the battle of Armageddon the battle of Armageddon is going to be man's atomic fire that blows the world up all right and destroys the world because the Bible says man has destroyed everything um but this right here at the white Throne is going to be where God Reigns his holy fire and he kills all the devils and kills all the bad things and then now let's read Revelation 21 here's John and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth okay cuz what had happened before that chter 20: 7 when a thousand years was ended Satan was loosed there was the Battle of Gog and Magog together to all the subjects together to try to fight against the righteous and they do not defeat them because you come over and then you got the white Throne judgment where all are judged look at verse 14 of chapter 20 before we get to 21 and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death see these Sinners are going to die one death and they're going to have to be raised again for another for judgment all right so they're going to have to be raised up and judged and then die the second death don't worry about the first death if you're born again you'll never see the second death but if you're not born again you going to see the second death cuz you're going to come up and give an account if we die to oursel here we don't have to go to the second death right if you're born again you've passed from what death unto life okay already here pass from Death unto life already been judged white Throne judgment is has nothing to do with you except you the one that'll be doing the judging right all right so let's keep reading now John well no I saw a new Heaven and new earth 21 verse1 for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away this one this one is passed away burn Over Again by God's fire going to burn everything out all right and what's going to happen is like brother R said that city is going to the Mountain's going to push up and then what did John see for the first heaven and first Earth will pass away and they more SE and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband so where is it coming to where was John standing when he saw this Vision he was standing on Earth so the prophet said that the new city is going to be on the earth that Mountain's going to push up just like we showed it's not going to be a straight like this it's going to have valleys and ridges but there's the mountain and what John saw was a direct copy cuz remember when God gives you the new birth what does he do he takes the old man and and and takes the nature out right but this form is still here so what does he do man was formed in the image of God all right now you're being reformed or reborn but it's not changing I didn't have two arms now I have I mean didn't have two when I was a center and three or six fingers and now I got five he didn't change this structure that's right he just burned it Off made it holy all right that's what he's doing with this city he's pushing that mountain up and that city is going to sit right down if there's a valley in that City it's going to sit right down on that mountain it's going to be just a a carbon copy because what does it got to do it's got to fit the pieces that got to fit together right right so now that's the same with you and I why you and I now the word has to form be formed in us right but it's reforming us but it this same guy you saw that was was doing all the sin and is the same guy that's doing all the you know the it's not righteous what I am but what inside of me has made me that way all right but it's the same form that I had when I was a sinner right this is the same form that the Earth had when it was before you know back in the Garden of Eden and even with all the sin on it it's never it's not going to reshape itself and be square where it was round the form and the foundation is is you know the sound same thing with the foundation of the Bible it don't change right and if he made a heaven and he made an earth it's not going to change but you're going to have a new like brother Brown said new if you look in the Bible it's not I mean in the correct Greek it's not new like you throw away and get a new one but it's redone everything that we've destroyed like all the trees and all the things like that will come back new oh yeah fresh everything will be fresh and you know that may not be a Grand Canyon or I don't know that in the Millennium I think everybody everything will pretty much stay the same cuz in the Millennium is just going to be the atomic fire when they when they destroyed heroshima and Nagasaki all it done was it just killed the people killed all the vegetation a lot of the buildings were still there and they've worked on bombs for years that would just destroy people and plants and not even bother the building right right so that's what we're going to see I believe when we come back in Millennium there'll be a new Heaven and a new Earth but it's not going to be new like this one this one's going to be Eternal God is going to come and dwell in this one sure he's going to come dwell in this one but right here you want read right here see all things have been made new all things are not made new here in the Millennium that's right cuz you still got the devil still got the Heathen that be raised up in the Millennium all the things like that uh the Bible even saids a child would die 100 and the center this and see that that's things that I don't understand that's going to happen in the Millennium cuz it's it's a lot closer to what we're living in now the the future h ruins like they are now could be well there was ruins back you know right 2,000 years ago but it won't be that here because of this listen and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there should be no more death neither sorrow or crying there should any more pain for the former things are passed away now that you we're talking about the pure future home here we're not talking about a millennium this is the future home all right and God shall wipe away all tears there shall be any more death sorrow crying neither any more pain but the former things have passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give to him that is a thirst for the Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things see there's there's seven overcoming in the Bible he that overcometh he that overcometh there's seven that's number eight number eight puts you in in eternity each one of those one through seven is a battle it's just like the statue of a perfect man it's it's a birth right it's a birth of the things that uh getting it out out of us but right here number eight is he that overcometh shall inherit all things all right so we inherit the earth and I will be as God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving abominable murderers hor mongers Sorcerers adulterers and Liars shall have their part in the lake which burth with fire and brimstone which is that second death showing that there'll be no kind of any sin at all anywhere around all right everything's in the Lake of Fire that's going in the Lake of Fire all right and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and taught with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me a bunch of people wait a minute he said he was going to show you a bride the Lamb's wife he didn't say I'm going to show you buildings and and parks and streets and houses he didn't say that didn't he but come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit the great high mountain and showed me that great City what the one that came down in verse two which was as the bride Adorn for a husband which was us the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light feminist her light talking about who you and I it's not the buildings that make a city when the city of Lula comes out for a parade all the buildings don't go out to the street right right who goes out to the street the people right city of Atlanta comes out for a parade all the skyscrapers don't just go right up to the and that's kind of carnal but that's the way you people think that the city is the buildings and no the city is the people her light was like into a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as Crystal now here he's going to describe this city and he had wall had a wall great and high and had 12 gates and at the gate 12 angels names written there on which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel look it's four square three gates on each side Ruben Dan it's car Benjamin all the 12 tribes right cuz you can't do away with them God said I'll never do away with Israel here we go back to Daniel 70 weeks you know he'll not do away with them he may punish them he may hide them but he'll not do away with them and on the East three gate on the north three Gat South three Gat and the West three gates like I draw it right here this wall had 12 foundations and on them the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb so your foundations right here you got your 12 Apostles what's the what's the word of God built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone but now he's the head right but Each corner is going to have the apostles not the people they're not going to sit there all the time with the city on top of their backs and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the lamb and he that taught with me had a golden rod to measure the city and the gate thereof and the wall thereof and the city lith four square and the length is large as the bread so in other words it's a perfect square and he measured the city with the re 12,000 furl which is how much, 1500 square miles right Prophet told you that the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal only way that can be be a pyramid all right pyramid shape because if this wall if the city was as high as it was wide it'd be straight up but if you got it at an angle like I said if you drive from here from here to Bartlesville 900 and something miles and if they're a th000 ft higher than us which they're probably not but say they were you'd never know right if you could see forever you could see the the U the angle as you were going up but you hardly would know you were going up right that's why that something down here can happen and it not be a square City Four Square they all thought it was like a cube you know the whole city was like a cube but even this uh even this uh wall L and he measured the wall thereof 140 and4 Cubit which which is 216 ft that's pretty good size wall but if you got A500 M Square incline in other words you could build a 200t wall um Stone Mountain is 8 uh 900 ft tall Stone Mountain is at the top you build a 200 ft fence around it guess what you still going to be able to see Stone Mountain except if you were standing right at the bottom of the wall you couldn't but if you were standing away from it you're still going to see the mountain all right so that's 2116 ft which is pretty impressive cuz we didn't build it God did and he measured the wall thereof 140 and 4 cubits according to the measure of a man that is a the Angel and the building of the wall of it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like into clear glass and the foundations of the wall the city were garnished with all mans of precious stones First Foundation with Jasper second Sapphire the Third doni the fourth an emerald the fifth sardon donx the sixth Sardis seventh crystalite eth Burl ninth topaz 10th whatever that word is and the 11th jessen and the 12th amethyst if you'll remember back several years ago brother George quinnn brought out what all those things were what those stones and the names of them meant and I've still got them somewhere in my Bible I'm not in my Bible but somewhere at home but it was really those things are just not put there it was like God just thr a pile of rocks together and said hey this is how it's going to look no there's to God remember there's a order to everything right and I saw no Temple therein right now we had a temple right here remember we had a temporary we had in Ezekiel 40 to 44 we had a millennium Temple that was built that Temple must got destroyed with everything else cuz it was temporary right this Eternal City that we're talking about right here is not temporary this thing's not going to ever go away right and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb or the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it but the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is a light thereof the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it the kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there he talking about the city City's going to Glow God's going to sit at the top of it on a throne read the future home brother random explains it just like he probably saw it in a vision probably God let him see it in a vision because you wouldn't get what he said out of a lot of the things that's in the Bible here all right but he remember a prophet goes up higher than anybody else and he can see further than anybody else God allow him to see all the way from how do you know Eve was blond-headed and blueeyed and Adam had hair down to his shoulders and he described it just like he was standing in the garden right right that's why he was a good Storyteller cuz he was there I believe God let him see those things that's right and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the into it see what's going to happen is is this is the way it's going to be said let's finish and there shall be no wise and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life all right so here we go to the city the city part is going to be inhabited by who the bride and 144,000 okay now that's bride from Paul's age all the way up to our age bride not people that's giv eternal life not people at the white Throne judgment foolish virgins or or people like that it's only going to be for the bride and the bridegroom me and June the only two that lives in our house of course we have children and God has children too but we're the only ones that live in the house right not somebody else so all the kings of the earth that are giving eternal life like it just said here and all the people that are giv eternal life are going to have to live outside the city and what goes on outside the city is going to be different than what goes on inside the city inside the seity there'll be no need of light he just said that cuz I believe it'll have an eternal glow it'll just glow for for eternity but on the outside they may still have day and night it doesn't matter who God's not going to do away with the sun I don't believe right he said you won't need no you won't need the light of the Sun in the city see what it said right it said in the city it won't have need of the son because remember just like go back to what I said God when he originally created something he can't I don't believe he can do away with it now man can have sin on it and he can pervert it but when he comes back to his original whatever was created in that six days of creation God's never going to do away with it I just don't believe that I believe God made that sun he made the moon he made Earth he made all these things in his economy and it's going to all come back to the same Earth's going to be U right and all those things are going to happen right here so I don't think we're going to walk into this place and it be a strange place right we're going to know where we're at we're going to know where we've been we're going to know where we come from and we're going to know where we at all right so that's what I believe cuz watch chapter 22 and then we'll finish and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it either side of the the river was there the Tree of Life which be 12 maners of fruits now tree of life was where Garden of Eden right right you can eat off of that one now you can eat off of it and live right right you could have lived off of that one if they could have got to the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden they were heading toward it but Satan you know give them the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that tree is not going to be in the garden I mean it's not going to be in the future home and that time it won't be a future home it'll be a present home right brother renom was preaching prophesying of a future home right but once we get in there you're not going to call it the future home it's going to be your heavenly home right and there was the Tree of Life which bear 12 matters of fruits and yield her fruit every month and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nation because remember the leaves on the tree that um the pommer worm Locust caterpillar and all that what they ate they ate the leaves the leaves were Fellowship remember the leaves brother R showed how the leaves would happy the wind blow in the leaves and you could get under it you know and have shade and and could have Fellowship to leave we see fellowships all come back together now there ain't going to be no more war all the kings of the nations are not going to be fighting against each other that's why they're going to come in and get a leaf off of the tree as a symbol that that leaf is for Fellowship right and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their forehead in other words in our brain right right here the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth to sea and sky which is who you and I and there shall be no light there they need no candle the light of the sun it's talking about in the city right for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall rain forever and ever and he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servant the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book now John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do not do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still behold I come quickly and my reward is with me me to give every man according to his work as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do these commandment this do his Commandment that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without her dogs Sorcerers whoremongers now what's he doing now he's dropping back and telling John what's happening now his City's being defiled by all these things that's city is not going to have these people in it right it's going to have these people that are converted in it but they're not going to be that when they're in the city dogs Sorcerers wh mongers and murderers adol and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I the root and offspring of David and the Bright Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come and he that Hearth say come let him there is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that Hearth the word of this prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifies these things sayth surely I come quickly amen and then here's what John said even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you all amen and then now for all these years has been expounded on from that amen but do you understand this city is a temp c a temporary City in the Millennium it's a temporary temporary thing but once sin is dealt with the white Throne judgments come we come to a city that it's our Eternal home there'll be no building done there the Bible says before we even think it God will answer all right it's an eternal world it's an eternal City that Abraham looked for and it won't be like I said it won't be a future home it'll be an eternal home it'll be our home for an eternity the difference in the people outside the city they can come in but but they got to go back out they don't live in that City all right you and I the Bride of Jesus Christ are the only people that are allowed to live in this city because this city was built Accord according to your desires from Paul's age from Steven which is the first martyr of the Holy Ghost during the Holy Ghost age to whoever is the last one that enters in in this last age those people are the only people because they held on to the word of God for their age and the testimony of Jesus Christ they held on to that and they became Born Again Christians which made them the Bride of Jesus Christ right not saying these people out here are any different it's just they don't get the privilege leges because what we did here is is we took and believed the word of God here right to its fullest extent that we know we were born again actually you got a part of that City when you were born again so you can't miss it that's right if you're born again you got a part of the city right here inside of you cuz he build it according to your desires not Adolf Hitler's desires or the man down the streets that's never going to have eternal life he built it according to your desires what you like the things you love um Jun will be my partner I believe that all my heart like brother Bram you know he had both of his wives arm and arm and walked into the city because they were both Born Again Christians not just because they were his wife they were both Born Again Christians and they both died and had pass you know one of them had passed on but remember meia asked him about going over there and M told I mean he told me to he said you won't have to worry about it over there he said there ain't no jealousy there ain't no you know so if your wife died and you marry another one which is lawful according to God's word then they'll both be there and you won't live as husband and wife as we do here but you will she'll be your companion for the rest of your life she'll be yours cuz brother Ram said he said you know um Adam wasn't complete without who Adam was not complete without Eve and if Adam wasn't complete without Eve you and I are not going to be complete without a mate right cuz we that's what we were given for right that's what you and sisters were given for took that rib out of Adam made Eve and I don't think God would went through that much trouble if he didn't think Adam and Eve should be together for an eternity right okay so and all those things that people try to preach that brother rown said all wrongs will be made right and all you'll get the right one over there I just believe I got the right one over here so I don't have to worry about over there that's right and over there there's no jealousy we won't have to worry about any of that stuff we you know you think you love your wife now you way to get over there you won't just love your wife that way you'll love everybody 10 million times more than whatever love you have for your wife now that's right and it's pure and and and holy that you want you know the the love you have for your wife now but that brother rown said that was he said take that times millions and I believe he said billions and he said that's the love that you'll have over there for everybody for a single person like someone that never married at whatever age and went in they don't have that same love that it'll be directed everybody be back and for everybody and there be no jealousy I mean like brother Bown said he said the women hugged me and I knew they were women so they must have had the form of a woman they wasn't just we're not going to look like cookie you know we're not going to look like little cookie cutters all of us are going to be the same gingerbread no we're going to be short and tall and I hope we're not going to be fat I hope that's all going to be done away with praise the Lord all the people in the building says amen amen but it doesn't matter because we're all going to be still human beings that's my whole point when you're born again it doesn't change your human being it changes the being that's inside of you which one day is going to change this outside person same way with the world the world just got off kilter sin but God's going to put that same earth right back upright and he's going to put sainted people on it to live for an eternity right so somewhere down in this underneath where we're walking there's a mountain that mountain right there somewhere over there in Jerusalem down under the ground and I believe it's just going to one day it's going to just push right up City's going to sit right down on it and brother R said we'll walk out on a redeemed entire Earth now this is not redeemed entire Earth the millennium's not but that future home right there is a redeem in other words Redemption was you drop the book you don't pick up the pencil you drop the book you pick up the book so God let the Earth fall he pick going to pick the Earth right back up to where Adam and Eve was in the garden you know going have to worry about the Lions and the tigers eating each other you know cuz they ate grass before maybe when uh California f up sinks then come out no no no cuz California sinks way back over here yeah California don't sink here California sinks over here they don't have anything to do with this city right right here this city right here is waiting for this time right here after that white Throne judgment when we come back that Mountain's going to go push right up all right we'll do something else next Sunday I don't know what we'll do something M so it was like War what this
