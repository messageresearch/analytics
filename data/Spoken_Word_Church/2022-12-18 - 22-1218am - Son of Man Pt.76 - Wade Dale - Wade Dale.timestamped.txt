[25:02] and what virtue went out of him and
[25:04] healed them all
[25:06] Revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the
[25:08] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[25:10] it where the noise of Thunder one of the
[25:11] four beasts saying come and see and I
[25:14] saw him Behold a white horse and he that
[25:16] sat on him had a bow and a crown was
[25:18] given unto him and he went forth
[25:19] conquering and to conquer you may be
[25:21] seated in the Lord at his Blessing to
[25:23] the reading of the word it is uh good to
[25:26] see sister Anna back with us oh it's
[25:28] been out sick thank God like Brother
[25:31] Anderson said it didn't get through the
[25:32] whole family the kids stayed good and
[25:34] everything's all right
[25:35] so we good with that all right
[25:38] so now what we've been talking about
[25:39] we've been talking about truth and we've
[25:41] been talking about also bringing in
[25:44] something that um that we all need to
[25:48] have and that strength we need to have
[25:49] power we need to have virtue we need to
[25:51] have power over the devil all right and
[25:54] we've been talking about the different
[25:55] things about truth and we're going to
[25:58] read here in brother brother Brown and
[26:00] layout of seeing Church age
[26:01] we've read it before and we've read it
[26:03] many many times brother Dale read this
[26:04] and he just kept reading it and reading
[26:06] when we were going through Revelations
[26:07] and different ones brother Brown says
[26:09] now this messenger Malachi 4 in
[26:11] Revelation 10 7. now you see there was
[26:13] two things that he came to do all right
[26:15] he came to do what restore the restore
[26:18] the faith of the fathers and from the
[26:20] beginning we'll talk about that a little
[26:21] bit more and then according to
[26:24] Revelations 10 7 break the seals or the
[26:27] seals come open which is The Headstone
[26:28] which is which is what the ministry of
[26:32] Jesus Christ just like it was 2000 years
[26:34] ago the truth not a truth but the truth
[26:38] everybody with me so number one hit what
[26:41] according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the
[26:42] hearts of the children that's one see
[26:45] brother Bradham can't change your heart
[26:48] God has to change your heart but he
[26:51] changed it through a message through a
[26:54] Ministry he changed our heart back to
[26:56] the thinking of the faith of the fathers
[26:59] that back to where Peter and Paul and
[27:01] the different one and Peter says look on
[27:03] us and and Paul says hey you know uh you
[27:06] followed me long enough devil get out of
[27:09] that woman and leave me alone or get out
[27:10] of that man and leave me alone all the
[27:12] different things because remember
[27:13] virtuous power
[27:15] virtue is not being a virgin we're going
[27:16] to talk about that this afternoon a
[27:19] couple of points I want you to realize
[27:21] one thing and I want you to think about
[27:22] this
[27:23] you look through the Bible
[27:25] and you look through some of the women
[27:27] some of the great women they talk about
[27:29] the great women of the Bible uh the
[27:31] rahabs the uh you got even even the
[27:35] woman at the well even you've got Ruth
[27:37] you
[27:38] Esther listen
[27:41] some of them weren't virgins some of
[27:42] them were
[27:45] well I'll raise your head up some of
[27:47] them were prostitutes but they're in the
[27:50] lineage of Jesus Christ
[27:52] they're Gentiles just like me and you
[27:54] and I'm going to read you a quote that I
[27:55] just found back there a few minutes ago
[27:57] that shocked me brother random said and
[27:59] I'll read it this afternoon Rahab is a
[28:01] type of the believer now how in the
[28:04] world
[28:04] can you can you place that without being
[28:07] a prophet and knowing what he's talking
[28:09] about because you and I were all
[28:11] prostitutes before we came to God I
[28:13] don't care if you were white lily virgin
[28:15] in your body you were a prostitute in
[28:18] your soul
[28:20] sorry about that but remember she became
[28:23] a Believer and God spared her life you
[28:27] became a believer in God prepared your
[28:28] life amen so thank God for Grace
[28:32] so number two he'll reveal the mysteries
[28:35] of the seven Thunders don't let that
[28:36] don't let that bother you we're going to
[28:38] get into that later on in Revelations 10
[28:40] which what the Revelation is contained
[28:42] in the seal so when he opened the seals
[28:44] the Thunders broke so we don't have to
[28:46] wait for some Thunder to clap or or
[28:49] seven men or ever have whatever they
[28:51] were you know a long time ago they
[28:52] thought it had to be seven men with
[28:53] their voice no that's not what it was
[28:55] it's the voice of God speaking to you
[28:58] I I you know I love brother Doherty but
[29:01] if if the Lord speaks to him that's God
[29:03] speaking to him
[29:04] then God's got to speak to me in my way
[29:06] so that I can understand him all right
[29:08] brother Doherty may catch it like that
[29:10] may take me six months
[29:12] amen all right so two he'll reveal those
[29:15] Mysteries it'll be those revealed look
[29:18] mystery truths that literally turn the
[29:21] hearts of the children to the
[29:22] Pentecostal fathers now that those
[29:24] mystery truths are not
[29:27] water baptism
[29:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:33] that was the faith of the fathers
[29:37] they taught
[29:38] Jesus Christ is water baptism they
[29:41] taught no eternal hell so that's these
[29:44] mystery truths he's talking about here
[29:45] are not
[29:53] trinitarian Doctrine but the first part
[29:55] of Malachi 4 is what took care of that
[29:57] when you come into the message of the
[29:58] hour when you got born again and we were
[30:00] talking about years you know about a
[30:02] year ago when you come in you have to
[30:04] get born again well when you get born
[30:06] again it's not born again in the message
[30:10] no you're not a message baby
[30:13] you're a Jesus Christ baby you're born
[30:16] again of the spirit of God and what does
[30:17] he leave you he leads you and guides you
[30:19] into all truthful he leads you into the
[30:21] Bible
[30:23] and then that will lead you to truth if
[30:27] it's the true New Birth so it'll have to
[30:29] be the message of the hour the first
[30:30] time you hear it you may question it but
[30:33] you get the new birth and you continue
[30:35] on then it's going to have to be that
[30:37] these truths
[30:39] from the part number one which is water
[30:42] baptism which is no eternal hell which
[30:44] is all the different things that brother
[30:45] Brown brought in the early part of his
[30:47] ministry but these Ministry truths is
[30:49] something that we're going to talk about
[30:50] and the seals and all the different
[30:52] things that we're going to talk about
[30:53] trying to weave it in a little bit
[30:55] because everybody
[30:56] everybody thought the first seal was why
[31:00] horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[31:03] even brother random caught it
[31:05] until God opened these mystery truths to
[31:07] him to literally turn us back to the
[31:10] faith of the fathers in other words
[31:11] change our body
[31:13] all right listen having all these
[31:15] virtues in your life will not change
[31:17] your body
[31:20] it will get you on the road to change
[31:22] your body but it will not change your
[31:24] body
[31:25] your body change will have to come from
[31:27] that headstone the son of man message
[31:30] and we'll get it to in a little while
[31:31] and bring the polls in because the third
[31:33] pull is to what a special group of
[31:35] people
[31:36] we'll talk about that in just a minute
[31:37] how's that going to fit in with this
[31:39] I'll show you in just a second just hang
[31:41] loose John 17 17 says sanctify them how
[31:45] are we going to get Sanctified by the
[31:47] truth
[31:48] brother round says Rahab was Sanctified
[31:50] by what believing the truth she said
[31:53] without even sin said she never saw
[31:56] listen to this she never saw
[31:59] um Joshua
[32:01] but she believed that God was with him
[32:04] in other words she told them we have
[32:06] been shaking in our boots since you
[32:09] crossed Jordan because somebody saw that
[32:10] great big Mighty Jordan open up and all
[32:13] you came walking across playing
[32:15] tambourine shouting and having a
[32:17] Pentecostal time y'all weren't scared
[32:19] but we are
[32:20] even Behind These great big walls that
[32:23] we built up we were scared
[32:25] but it Sanctified him when she took and
[32:27] put that Scarlet rope
[32:31] that's what saved them right that's what
[32:33] Sanctified them red blood Sanctified
[32:36] them and Joshua said hey if you see that
[32:38] red cord do not destroy that house
[32:41] amen
[32:43] that's the same way with me and you as
[32:44] somebody was saying the other day you
[32:46] know you as brother Ryan was talking
[32:48] about you going through life and you
[32:49] just you know happy-go-lucky and care of
[32:52] the world and everything blah blah blah
[32:54] blah that thing was over it was around
[32:57] there it was waiting on you to come to a
[32:59] place
[33:00] to where you stopped like Rahab stopped
[33:02] and said hey I believe what's coming
[33:05] we're getting we're going to be
[33:06] destroyed
[33:08] you know what I want you and every one
[33:10] of us to do this year I want you to be
[33:12] destroyed
[33:17] I'm destroyed
[33:18] at this several years ago
[33:21] the wrath of God was poured out on my
[33:24] soul
[33:28] everybody's going to come to the wrath
[33:30] of God you're either going to come to it
[33:31] here are you going to come to it over
[33:33] there that's right so I want to take it
[33:35] here yes I want to be sprinkled and
[33:37] covered by his blood I don't want him to
[33:40] be sprinkled with my blood
[33:45] let his blood be on us and our children
[33:47] you see how that got them people they
[33:49] got the blood of Jesus on them and they
[33:51] got what destroyed
[33:52] right all right I want to have I want to
[33:55] have his blood on me once once I come to
[33:57] a destruction that's why it's got to
[33:59] come to a new birth it's going to come
[34:00] to a death yes destroy me
[34:05] destroy me Lord
[34:07] oh no I want to be blessed and yeah I
[34:09] want to be blessed too but you got to
[34:10] destroy that old man first
[34:12] sanctify them through what thy truth Thy
[34:15] word is the truth as thou has sent me
[34:18] into the world even so I've
[34:20] sent them into the world you we've got
[34:23] to go into the world Listen Rahab was in
[34:25] the world she went to the world
[34:27] brother Brown said and I'll read it this
[34:29] afternoon she got caught
[34:31] in a trap in other words her parents
[34:34] maybe didn't have any money she had to
[34:35] go on the street and do what she was
[34:37] doing she was trapped well weren't you
[34:38] and I trapped into it
[34:40] hello somebody is what brother Ram said
[34:42] we were trapped into it we were trapped
[34:44] into this by our adulteress parent Eve
[34:46] and Adam but what happened was we found
[34:49] sanctification in the word of God where
[34:52] he can so sanctify you that even Rahab
[34:55] had a baby named
[34:58] Boaz
[35:01] and Boaz is a type of Christ
[35:03] coming to a gentile prostitute
[35:06] come on somebody yeah we're we preach
[35:09] Purity we preach but we preach Graves
[35:11] too if you don't see grace I told
[35:13] somebody was talking about the other day
[35:14] I'll promise you one thing if you can't
[35:18] extend Grace to somebody Grace has not
[35:21] been extended to you yet
[35:23] if you can't extend Grace to somebody it
[35:26] has not been extended to you yet because
[35:28] you can't understand Grace you
[35:30] understand law do this don't do that do
[35:33] this don't do that
[35:34] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[35:36] what did he do he Sanctified himself
[35:39] Jesus Christ did say look I'm not going
[35:41] to have that I'm not going to have a
[35:42] wife I'm not going to have family I'm
[35:44] not going to have this I'm going to have
[35:46] a bride yes by spiritual union not by
[35:49] natural Union by spiritual union look
[35:52] that way Satan can have nothing to do
[35:54] with it
[35:56] he can't defile this body because it's a
[36:00] spiritual body he can defile this body
[36:03] but he can't defile the one that's
[36:04] inside of Us Praise the Lord
[36:07] also might be Sanctified together you
[36:09] and I might be Sanctified what through
[36:12] the truth that's why the prophet of God
[36:14] had to bring us truth back
[36:16] had to restore truth so that he we could
[36:19] even get started right
[36:21] get by with me
[36:23] all right look now we're talking about
[36:25] the three different levels of man we got
[36:27] the outside which you see right now see
[36:28] which is sea tastes feel smelling here
[36:30] then you've got an inside guy which is a
[36:32] spirit that's what we've been talking
[36:33] about the past several months is those
[36:36] five senses memory reason conscious
[36:38] affection imagination that's that middle
[36:40] realm that Spirit realm that Satan can
[36:43] can get a shot he's got a shot at but so
[36:45] does God God got a shot you know what
[36:47] that one in the middle the control man
[36:49] is one fake or doubt today you're either
[36:52] Faith or you're doubt one of the two all
[36:54] right you're either born again you're
[36:56] either white or black inside your soul
[36:57] today you're not great
[36:59] there's no gray area with God a man
[37:02] you're either born again and have give
[37:05] your life and and let the wrath of God
[37:07] birth you or you're looking at the wrath
[37:10] of God if you don't get born again not
[37:12] just Bible I'm sorry if it hurts your
[37:14] feelings
[37:16] but it's the truth I'm telling you
[37:18] we got to come to a place to listen to a
[37:20] brother the other day and he's right
[37:22] these smiling Joel Olsteen preachers
[37:24] that Don't Preach against sins
[37:25] everybody's going to heaven you know
[37:28] we're going to have prostitutes in
[37:29] heaven and we're gonna have all these
[37:30] different you know everything's we're
[37:31] all going to heaven no we're not
[37:35] God is a jealous God God is an Angry God
[37:38] when you turn him down because he's
[37:40] going to give you 120 years and know
[37:43] it's time to rip 120 years
[37:46] and then not one person got saved except
[37:49] his household
[37:50] so the Inside Man is the spirit man
[37:52] which is controlled by five senses
[37:54] remember regions conscious imagination
[37:55] and then inside of you is what inside of
[37:58] that spirit is a saw in this controlled
[38:00] by one thing
[38:01] free will all right Free Will free moral
[38:04] agency everybody
[38:06] so you can't tell me his brother Ryan
[38:08] was covering today
[38:10] you know
[38:12] and it's hard to preach this
[38:15] because you you look at this you say
[38:17] well I always was eternal yes you were
[38:19] in the mind of God
[38:20] but I'm going to read your quote where
[38:22] brother Brown said you come to this
[38:23] world lost now what does that mean to
[38:25] you lost lost means lost it don't mean
[38:28] you got a little speck or something menu
[38:30] somewhere no way God won't dwell in an
[38:32] unclean vessel the things I did when I
[38:34] was a sinner and God was nowhere to be
[38:36] found except in his mind he said I know
[38:40] buddy I'm gonna get you in 1997. I'm
[38:43] gonna knock you off your feet
[38:44] and when I knock you off your feet I see
[38:47] and have this ready for you that you're
[38:50] gonna hear me and you're going to
[38:52] respond to me that's the that's to me
[38:54] that's Redemption to me that if it
[38:56] wasn't then it'd just be that God pulled
[38:58] you through a tube and said well I know
[38:59] you always had eternal life in your soul
[39:01] so I'm just gonna pull you through this
[39:02] too no
[39:03] you were lost yes why would you need a
[39:06] free will if you had God in your soul
[39:08] when you were born
[39:09] please you do away with Jesus you do
[39:12] away with what what the whole Plan of
[39:14] Redemption
[39:15] but the people in the message use it as
[39:18] something that makes us better than
[39:19] anybody else because we came with this
[39:21] special something else
[39:22] no we were special in the mind of God
[39:26] and then when we got born again and we
[39:28] got that old man died that old man got
[39:31] killed amen we became what not just
[39:35] children of God we became God
[39:37] we became part of his soul yes soul to
[39:40] soul
[39:42] but now we're working on the second
[39:44] realm or the memory reason conscious
[39:46] affects and Imagination
[39:48] now watch and that determines what
[39:50] spirit is in there if it's the spirit of
[39:52] God it'll feed on the things of God
[39:55] and it won't feed on anything of the
[39:58] world
[39:59] the prophet of God says now look now
[40:02] inside of that Spirit which you become
[40:03] when you're born in the earth and the
[40:05] Breath of Life is breathed into you look
[40:07] that spirit is of a worthy nature now is
[40:09] God a worldly nature
[40:12] anything of God a worldly nature
[40:15] I'm just reading you a quote
[40:17] the spirit is of a worldly nature
[40:20] because it was not given from God it was
[40:23] permitted by God
[40:26] amen that's why all babies go to heaven
[40:28] because he know you can't come to that
[40:30] free will place and he can give you
[40:33] eternal life but you're not bride
[40:36] no way nope only the redeemed that comes
[40:41] to full Redemption is considered bride
[40:43] yes they'll be Eternal yes they'll be in
[40:45] in the in the world to come but they
[40:48] will not be bride nobody with me
[40:51] now you got that for every child that's
[40:53] born in the world is born in what
[40:56] sin shaping and iniquity come to the
[41:00] world speaking lies that sounds really
[41:01] good
[41:03] but that's where we all were now look
[41:05] right here so that person inside there
[41:08] is a center to begin with
[41:11] inside where inside your soul
[41:14] where does unclean Spirit gets driven
[41:16] out of your soul
[41:18] and God won't dwell on an unclean battle
[41:20] you can't have God in Satan in the same
[41:21] place
[41:22] nope that's that old two Soul Doctrine
[41:24] they just wrapped it up in new new
[41:26] Christmas wrapping paper and fed it to
[41:28] the people of the message sorry about
[41:30] that but it does
[41:33] there's five outlets in the spirit and
[41:34] you can't think with your body you have
[41:36] to think with your spirit you can't have
[41:38] conscience in your body it has no mental
[41:40] faculty at all your body doesn't so you
[41:42] have to think with your spirit that's
[41:43] why I said all along don't worry about
[41:45] this guy
[41:46] well it's just my flesh's fault no it's
[41:48] not your flesh's fault
[41:50] no your flesh got here because your Mom
[41:53] and Daddy got together permitted by God
[41:54] got together and produced your body and
[41:57] then God put a soul inside of you for
[41:59] you to make a choice all right so it's
[42:01] the choice you make right
[42:04] but your body don't think you don't
[42:08] think or your body you only react I'm
[42:10] only reacting to what I know that I'm
[42:12] doing my hands like this
[42:13] they're not uncontrollable
[42:17] we're all controlled by something
[42:19] like I said before it didn't bother me
[42:21] to go open up a
[42:23] um go to the convenience store and open
[42:25] the thing up with this same hand
[42:27] grab a case of beer out and go drink it
[42:30] didn't bother me a bit
[42:35] so I was what thinking with my
[42:38] with my hand do my hand did what my
[42:40] spirit told it to do
[42:43] but now that I have the spirit of God in
[42:45] that same place now this hand opens the
[42:49] Bible and hopefully it is teaching and
[42:52] preaching the word of God and God didn't
[42:54] have to destroy this he just changed it
[42:57] amen he didn't destroy it he changed it
[43:00] he destroyed your own nature
[43:02] and then work so From the Inside Out
[43:04] Satan worked from the outside in that's
[43:06] the Battleground the greatest battle
[43:08] ever Falls in your mind
[43:10] but you don't think with your mind you
[43:12] think with your heart
[43:13] everybody with me
[43:15] so you have to think with your spirit
[43:17] you have to reason you can't reason with
[43:19] your physical being reason doesn't see
[43:21] taste feels smelling hair reason is what
[43:24] you can make in your mind if you're
[43:26] asleep or you're out your body is lying
[43:28] there dead but your spirit can still
[43:30] reason there's five senses that control
[43:32] that inside man that's stupid the not
[43:35] the center but the outside room now to
[43:37] the last man which is the soil there's
[43:39] only one sense
[43:41] as I said before today you're either
[43:43] lost or saved one of the two now you may
[43:46] be in the process all right you may be
[43:49] in the process of going through
[43:50] justification sanctification but
[43:52] sanctification does not put you in the
[43:54] body
[43:56] it cleans you up and sets you aside for
[43:59] service doesn't put you in service the
[44:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost is what puts
[44:04] you in service then you have to take
[44:06] that Holy Ghost though then you gotta
[44:08] fight come on
[44:10] you gotta fight that memory reason
[44:11] conscious affect your imagination
[44:13] because you know what Satan wants you to
[44:14] remember everything you did bad
[44:18] oh why I'm sorry am I the only one again
[44:20] oh okay
[44:23] but you got a free Mole agency
[44:26] reject
[44:29] well I didn't have a I had this
[44:32] I had this eternal life in me and
[44:34] and I didn't make a choice yeah you did
[44:36] make a choice
[44:38] you made a choice and God knew your
[44:39] choice
[44:40] therefore he had it waiting for you when
[44:43] you got here remember the prophet of God
[44:45] said he sends down your representation
[44:48] the woman at the well had representation
[44:50] from what predestination not from her
[44:53] mom and daddy not from the situation she
[44:54] was in because you know what that
[44:56] got saved sorry to say it like that that
[44:59] got saved brother Graham said she
[45:01] did God eternal life
[45:04] that's us
[45:06] we're not Lily white I'll promise you
[45:07] that not in our soul
[45:09] some people touched the Garment of Jesus
[45:11] was made well others smacked him in the
[45:13] face and hit him on the head so in other
[45:15] words here is two attitudes that comes
[45:17] to brother that comes to brother Jesus
[45:19] that comes to Jesus and you got Jesus
[45:21] being touched and the lady was healed
[45:23] and you got these Roman soldiers that
[45:25] was beating him over the head and saying
[45:26] hey tell us who hit you put a put a rope
[45:29] and put a thing around his face it's the
[45:31] attitude that you come in and we'll get
[45:33] down to the bottom
[45:36] because this is what I was this is
[45:37] something I want to insert right here it
[45:39] was obeying what God Said do now that's
[45:41] what these virtues are it's obeying what
[45:43] to do
[45:45] all right
[45:46] what brought the power
[45:50] we all need
[45:52] to be brought to that power
[45:54] which is called virtue because remember
[45:56] power is virtue not living a virgin Life
[45:58] we'll get to that this afternoon
[46:00] what brought the virtue is obedience to
[46:03] the word of God
[46:05] all right
[46:06] so the word of God is we've been talking
[46:08] about many times and we've all been
[46:09] covering about you know doing the right
[46:11] thing and coming to church and having an
[46:13] attitude that you want to come not that
[46:14] you've got to come
[46:16] right all right and I want to add
[46:17] something in there too if you don't mind
[46:21] coming to church doesn't mean just
[46:22] getting here three minutes for the
[46:23] service Stars
[46:26] boy now you're quiet
[46:28] some of y'all come wobbling in right
[46:30] when I come in
[46:31] that's not right
[46:33] that's not coming to church
[46:36] y'all sat out in the car and talk on the
[46:38] phone until you I get ready to preach
[46:39] then you come in here and show yourself
[46:41] no God sees more than that
[46:44] you need to be here praying you know why
[46:46] because you're going to bring some
[46:47] spirit inside with you if you don't get
[46:49] it out of here between there and you
[46:51] sitting down
[46:53] ain't gonna be no sitting downstairs
[46:55] either you say oh I'm tired well
[46:57] if you're sick you can sit downstairs if
[46:59] you're just gonna sit down there because
[47:00] you don't like sitting up here you can
[47:02] go home
[47:04] because you don't want to be here anyway
[47:06] because you know what you walk through
[47:08] those doors there's a spirit on you that
[47:09] spirit's gonna get exposed inside this
[47:11] building and it don't want to get
[47:13] exposed so it stays out there
[47:22] because I want you to look right here
[47:24] this is Samuel
[47:25] a prophet
[47:28] let me set the stage here this is Samuel
[47:30] that was just a little something we need
[47:32] to we need to sharpen our pencils
[47:34] we need to Sharp my pencils get here
[47:36] brother Brown said 20 minutes before the
[47:39] service starts
[47:40] and do what pray
[47:43] read your Bible
[47:45] not come hurrying in here two minutes
[47:47] before you're hindering the service yeah
[47:50] you are
[47:56] it's enough hindrance without all that
[48:01] okay so let's just try to get here and
[48:03] be a servant of God and a child of God
[48:06] and get to church on time
[48:09] you sure won't miss a doctor's
[48:10] appointment I promise you that
[48:13] you'll be there 15 minutes for the
[48:15] appointment just to make sure you don't
[48:16] miss it for them to tell you you're sick
[48:22] we're trying to give you the gospel to
[48:24] tell you you can get healed from that
[48:28] yeah come on first here we go
[48:33] thinking it's our thinking think
[48:36] ing you know I mean really
[48:37] we gonna rush to the doctor for him to
[48:39] tell you you got something wrong with
[48:41] you
[48:44] and then not come in here and say God I
[48:47] want to get rid of all that
[48:49] uh and you know what we don't charge a
[48:51] dime you pay your tithes to Jesus Christ
[48:53] you don't pay at the church okay
[48:56] and you'll go pay him 500 at the
[48:58] doctor's office to tell you sick
[49:00] well I'm gonna tell you for free you're
[49:02] well if you'll come here and do what God
[49:03] tells you to do
[49:05] amen because look watch this you say
[49:08] well I'm a believer I'm this I'm that
[49:09] watch this right here here is Samuel now
[49:12] what did Samuel tell Saul
[49:14] Samuel is what Samuel is a prophet
[49:17] he's the prophet of the day
[49:20] come on he's the prophet of the day
[49:23] all right and Saul is the king of the
[49:26] day
[49:26] that the people elected not God
[49:30] so Samuel says Saul you got to go to
[49:34] these two kings can't remember their
[49:36] name but you gotta go to these two kings
[49:37] Kill Them All
[49:39] come on
[49:42] Saul says y'all do it no problem
[49:45] well you know he doesn't
[49:47] but you know what Saul's excuse was
[49:50] sausage well I brought these two kings
[49:53] in maybe we can convert them
[49:57] oh well I'm gonna save some of these
[50:00] sheep and and goats for sacrifice Lord
[50:04] prophet no he didn't do what the prophet
[50:06] told him to do
[50:08] and you know what that you know what
[50:10] happened to Saul
[50:11] God took the kingdom away from him right
[50:13] there for not doing what the prophet
[50:15] said and Samuel said hi to Lord as great
[50:18] delight and burn offerings and sacrifice
[50:20] this is after Saul said hey I got all
[50:22] these animals because Samuel walks in
[50:24] and he goes
[50:25] he looks back in the room and there's
[50:27] two kings sitting back there in the
[50:28] prison
[50:29] when he comes in a little bit further
[50:31] and he hears the blading of sheep and
[50:33] and he hears the animals and he said
[50:35] what is this I hear him Saul sauce it
[50:38] all but like I said but we got some
[50:40] burnt offering here now we're just going
[50:41] to offer it to the Lord and we got these
[50:43] two kings back here and we're gonna
[50:45] we're gonna convert them
[50:47] you're gonna see what happened to him in
[50:48] just a second
[50:50] by a prophet
[50:53] not by General by a prophet he took
[50:56] Saul's sword
[50:58] and cut their head off
[51:02] and Simon said half the Lord is great
[51:04] delight and burnt offering the sacrifice
[51:06] as in obeying the voice of the Lord
[51:08] question mark
[51:10] behold to obey
[51:14] would I read down here obedience to the
[51:17] word of God
[51:19] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[51:23] I mean the message I believe the prophet
[51:25] I believe this uh Lord I I know you know
[51:28] a little bit of this a little bit of
[51:29] that come on that doesn't mean that much
[51:32] no I'm like what brother Dale said he
[51:34] worried many times about why God told
[51:37] Israel to kill him even kill the babies
[51:42] this is our loving God
[51:44] he said take every one of those
[51:46] amalekites and kill them babies and all
[51:49] but you know what he was doing in our
[51:52] eyes it was a Slaughter
[51:54] and God's eyes was I'm going to save all
[51:56] them babies I can't do anything about
[51:58] these old people but I can save them
[52:00] babies
[52:01] and I can you know what if they would
[52:02] have done away with all the amalekites
[52:04] the amount of cops would have never
[52:05] bothered Israel again but since he let
[52:07] some of them go
[52:09] they bothered him the whole time it was
[52:10] like a brother Brown said a hair in the
[52:12] biscuit they just followed him along and
[52:13] it was trouble all the time well I'm
[52:15] talking about me and you we need to chop
[52:16] off all that stuff all that stuff needs
[52:18] to die don't divorce it and just say
[52:20] well I'll be good on Sunday and not on
[52:21] Monday
[52:22] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[52:25] and to hearken listen to God than the
[52:28] fat of Rams for Rebellion that's what
[52:31] you are
[52:34] that's what I am and you are
[52:37] if we don't do what God says we rebel
[52:39] against his word
[52:41] yeah right mine the wrong crowd
[52:46] you're rebellious if you don't do what
[52:48] God said you're a rebel you're a rebel
[52:50] you're rebellious
[52:51] and you're not rebellious to me brother
[52:53] they don't know the ministry you're
[52:54] rebellious to God
[52:57] and brother Brandon we all we believe
[52:58] brother Brown was a prophet but I don't
[53:00] believe we need to be here 20 minutes
[53:01] before service starts well you're a
[53:02] rebel
[53:03] and you're what for Rebellion is as the
[53:06] sin
[53:07] of witchcraft
[53:09] in other words you're formulating your
[53:12] own idea
[53:13] you've got your old cauldron and you
[53:15] just you just put what in it you want to
[53:17] and you just Stir It Up that's
[53:20] Witchcraft and look and stubbornness
[53:23] is as iniquity and idolatry
[53:27] hmm boy that hurt all of us didn't it
[53:31] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[53:34] because thou has rejected what the word
[53:38] the word rejected thee from being King
[53:39] Saul continued to be king but God never
[53:42] recognized it anymore
[53:45] he raised up David
[53:47] David's the King this is not the king
[53:50] this guy can't do what I said but even
[53:52] though David was a murderer
[53:54] David was a liar
[53:56] David was an adulterer
[54:00] God still said
[54:02] he's a man after my own heart he did not
[54:05] say
[54:06] this Saul was
[54:08] right even though Saul said I think
[54:10] we'll save a few of these and we'll
[54:11] sacrifice them and and we'll try to
[54:13] convert them to men and also said I mean
[54:16] Samuel said no give me a sword
[54:19] I think the Bible says he went and
[54:20] pulled the sword
[54:21] so he went Samuel this old prophet
[54:25] thank God he sent us a prophet with a
[54:28] sword in his hand
[54:29] and he went over there and he put his
[54:31] foot on one of them's neck and he took
[54:33] that one's head off put his foot on the
[54:35] other one's neck and took that one's
[54:36] head off and he handed that sword back
[54:38] to Saul and says you better do what God
[54:40] Said do from now on and walked out the
[54:43] door
[54:44] well if we'd have somebody do like that
[54:45] we'd be all upset about it
[54:48] but that's the word of God
[54:50] hey man let the sword of the word
[54:53] correct all the error
[54:55] brother Brian said look we're not
[54:57] building an organization I'm not here
[54:58] this morning to build an organization
[55:00] craft never sent me to build an
[55:02] organization he sent me to build what
[55:04] individuals
[55:06] I know for a fact this whole world's not
[55:08] going to get saved
[55:09] amen I know this whole world is not
[55:12] going to accept this message of the hour
[55:14] amen and I know there's a lot of people
[55:17] that's around the message that ain't
[55:19] gonna make it either
[55:22] but individuals
[55:24] individuals
[55:26] individuals some may be right here
[55:28] somebody somebody may be wanting waiting
[55:30] on me to go to knowledge or want me to
[55:32] head on up to a guidelines because
[55:33] that's where you're at but just be
[55:35] patient because what we're going to pull
[55:36] everybody up if we can
[55:38] that's what we're going to talk about in
[55:39] just a minute why did Brother Brown
[55:40] bring us three pulls
[55:43] pull
[55:44] not push
[55:46] we'll read it in just a second we'll get
[55:47] to it
[55:49] that'd be all right say Amen
[55:51] Christ at me to build individuals to the
[55:54] statue of Jesus Christ that they may be
[55:56] not that he
[55:58] may be the PowerHouse and the dwelling
[56:01] place of the Spirit by his word
[56:05] by his words he built up the individual
[56:08] to that place not built an organization
[56:10] to a greater denomination but build an
[56:13] individuals the Sons and Daughters of
[56:15] God that's the idea
[56:17] add to your faith first reverse your
[56:19] knowledge
[56:20] now you're coming to a place
[56:23] so let's talk about virtue just for a
[56:24] minute now we know we looked at the
[56:26] definition we're going to look at it
[56:27] again
[56:28] the sake of the ones who weren't here
[56:31] um good to see brother John's mom back
[56:32] there with us
[56:34] and sister Rebecca's Mama too yeah
[56:37] sorry both
[56:39] she got her kids here today
[56:41] good to see you Mom
[56:43] she played that tambourine
[56:45] love that
[56:47] Luke 6 verse 19 says the whole multitude
[56:49] sought to touch him for their virtue out
[56:51] of him
[56:52] and heal them all in other words it was
[56:54] strength that came out of Jesus they
[56:56] knew they knew his background this woman
[56:58] at the that had a blood issue she what
[57:01] she had to know his background because
[57:03] she said if I can only Touch the Hem of
[57:06] His Garment I'll be made wealth I can
[57:08] only touch him touch the Garment not him
[57:10] so he came up behind she came up behind
[57:12] him and touched the board of His Garment
[57:14] immediately her issue of blood stance
[57:17] Jesus said who touched me when they all
[57:19] denied it Peter said wait in a minute
[57:22] Lord everybody's touching you
[57:25] he said but Peter somebody's touched me
[57:27] special than what you're probably Peter
[57:30] had him by the by the arm and said Lord
[57:32] well that wasn't any virtue going out of
[57:34] that but that woman needed something
[57:36] Jesus said somebody had touched me for I
[57:39] perceive that virtue or strength is gone
[57:43] out of me and then when the woman saw
[57:44] that she was not hidden she came
[57:46] trembling following down before him and
[57:48] we know what happens to daughter be of
[57:50] good Comfort thy faith hath made thee
[57:52] whole
[57:53] go on peace
[57:55] praise the Lord can we do that today can
[57:58] we Touch the Hem of His Garment today
[58:00] and say God I got a need I don't have to
[58:02] see you
[58:03] I don't even have to hear you
[58:05] I just got to believe you
[58:07] I still believe what you've already said
[58:08] not what's coming up but what you
[58:10] already said all right
[58:12] and that word Virtue we know is the same
[58:14] thing as when he said power will be
[58:16] given to you from on high right before
[58:18] he ascended and came back on the
[58:20] Pentecost is that right which is dunamis
[58:22] which is what it's where we get to work
[58:24] Dynamite brother Bernie Villanueva wore
[58:27] this night wore this word out for years
[58:28] and years when he come here he loved
[58:30] that word dunamis which is power Mighty
[58:33] work strength strength power and ability
[58:36] inherent power power residing in a thing
[58:38] it's got to be in you before you can
[58:39] give it out all right you got to have
[58:41] money in the bank before you write the
[58:42] check
[58:44] some have tried it doesn't work
[58:47] all right let's go let's keep on going
[58:49] now here's what we do what's the first
[58:51] thing have faith and be born again
[58:52] that's laying the foundation we've been
[58:55] staying on faith for a long time listen
[58:56] you got to believe this is right message
[58:59] you've got to believe that I can't make
[59:01] you believe I can preach from now to
[59:03] Noah 120 years it's gonna rain
[59:08] next service it's gonna rain
[59:11] Wednesday night it's gonna rain
[59:14] Sunday it's gonna rain
[59:17] Sunday afternoon it's gonna rain
[59:20] 120 years Michael he preached that they
[59:23] don't tell how many tapes he had
[59:26] brother Adam had 1100 sermons in like 30
[59:28] years
[59:29] he probably had six or seven thousand
[59:31] sermons and it all was on one thing it's
[59:34] gonna rain amen did it save anybody no
[59:37] eight people that's all that Art's gonna
[59:39] hold anyway
[59:41] coach God knew that
[59:43] okay everybody with me so you got to
[59:46] believe you got to take it into your
[59:47] heart and say look I believe not what
[59:49] I'm saying you believe what God's saying
[59:51] through me
[59:52] all right
[59:53] take out all the other stuff and just
[59:55] say look count that to my ignorance but
[59:57] if I tell you what the word of God says
[59:58] directly from the word of God you're not
[1:00:00] fighting me you're fighting God
[1:00:01] amen you're not fighting brother Dale
[1:00:03] you hadn't fought brother Dale all these
[1:00:05] years you've been fighting God
[1:00:07] all right that's what I believe
[1:00:10] amen that's what I believe all right you
[1:00:12] gotta believe the same thing
[1:00:14] brother Ryan was talking about all the
[1:00:17] what the word Lula meant and that was
[1:00:19] pretty neat I like that
[1:00:22] but listen it's not a place
[1:00:24] we can be just as lost
[1:00:28] as a blind dog in The Meat House they
[1:00:30] always say
[1:00:32] but if you're born again
[1:00:34] you're going to get something from God
[1:00:35] and God's obligated
[1:00:38] to get you to the right place
[1:00:40] he's obligated to what his word his word
[1:00:43] said I'll lead you and guide you into
[1:00:47] that was weak all trees all right not
[1:00:51] just some
[1:00:53] first you have faith then you add virtue
[1:00:54] to your faith this is the next column
[1:00:56] pour your foundation Faith then your
[1:00:58] faith at virtue now right there knocks a
[1:01:01] lot of us down
[1:01:02] yes sir add virtue to your faith that
[1:01:05] doesn't just mean living a virgin life
[1:01:06] that's what we're going to cover this
[1:01:07] afternoon because it is truly the word
[1:01:10] Virtue does connect to a virgin life and
[1:01:14] listen sisters if you were a virgin
[1:01:16] before you married if you're still a
[1:01:17] virgin now before you you met somebody
[1:01:19] you have power that 90 of this world has
[1:01:23] no idea what kind of power you hold
[1:01:25] that's right now some of us sisters come
[1:01:28] on now sisters and brothers that have
[1:01:30] got married and you're not a virgin
[1:01:31] anymore
[1:01:32] we know that's for a fact
[1:01:34] you hold a power inside of you sisters
[1:01:37] that brother Brown said you hold a
[1:01:39] virtue in you that no man can do
[1:01:41] anything with
[1:01:42] you're the only one that can control it
[1:01:44] you're the one that can say yes and I
[1:01:47] know we beat on the women all the time
[1:01:48] but you know what there's some there's
[1:01:50] some guys that needs to be virgins too
[1:01:51] you know okay we may have to talk about
[1:01:54] later on but not today all right because
[1:01:57] listen when we get to the when we get
[1:01:59] past the tax perfect man when we get
[1:02:01] into The Headstone you're gonna have to
[1:02:02] cover marriage indoors
[1:02:04] you got to cover some of those things
[1:02:06] that to keep yourself pure
[1:02:09] now that don't mean like I said before
[1:02:10] that don't mean well I'm a virgin I'm
[1:02:12] going to heaven no that don't mean that
[1:02:15] because God's got to transform you into
[1:02:18] a virgin
[1:02:19] in your soul not in your body there's no
[1:02:21] way you can reverse that
[1:02:23] Catholic church has tried to do it they
[1:02:24] try to reverse it and say that you're a
[1:02:26] virgin now and nothing gonna happen
[1:02:30] like the old saying once saved always
[1:02:31] say well no no
[1:02:34] if you're a virgin today count yourself
[1:02:37] one of the strongest women on the face
[1:02:39] of this Earth
[1:02:41] sister says amen this brother says Amen
[1:02:44] to keep yourself is a strength that this
[1:02:47] world does not know about because they
[1:02:50] want you to be a pervert from a time
[1:02:51] you're six or seven years old
[1:02:53] I hate to say that but it's the truth
[1:02:58] but that's not going to take you to
[1:03:00] heaven
[1:03:01] but it will help you
[1:03:03] to live a virgin life but you and I are
[1:03:05] supposed to be living the Virgin life
[1:03:07] ourselves men and women
[1:03:11] because I'm gonna read your quote here
[1:03:12] either today or tonight where brother
[1:03:13] Brown calls us The Virtuous sinless
[1:03:15] pride of Jesus Christ how do we get
[1:03:17] there
[1:03:20] well we did we did some way we're trying
[1:03:22] to get to it now
[1:03:24] by what faith virtue knowledge
[1:03:26] Temperance but it doesn't mean a virgin
[1:03:28] life
[1:03:29] you know like the woman or a man or so
[1:03:31] forth that doesn't have nothing to do
[1:03:33] with that
[1:03:34] all right it has nothing to do with that
[1:03:36] virtue right there brother Dale covered
[1:03:38] this many years ago about the meanings
[1:03:41] of these words in a worldly manner and
[1:03:44] the meanings and what brother Brown gave
[1:03:46] us and are totally different
[1:03:47] because this is for not going to cover
[1:03:49] but I'll just give you a little a little
[1:03:51] snippet brother Brown says two things
[1:03:54] that really
[1:03:55] stands out in my heart he says you know
[1:03:57] he said
[1:03:59] kissing was potential adultery
[1:04:03] wow
[1:04:06] and the sex glands are in your lips
[1:04:08] if you've ever kissed your wife you'll
[1:04:10] know that
[1:04:11] sorry but if you hadn't then you waited
[1:04:13] your husband and wife you her husband
[1:04:15] and wife don't play around and think you
[1:04:18] can get by with it because you're it's a
[1:04:21] connection they're not your sex glands
[1:04:23] but it's a connection to we'll get to
[1:04:25] that later on but we need to live clean
[1:04:27] we need to try our best to live as clean
[1:04:29] as we can all right I know this world
[1:04:31] just absolutely I mean you look over
[1:04:33] here and you see a naked woman and to
[1:04:34] get away from her you look over here and
[1:04:35] you see one worse so I mean you just
[1:04:38] bouncing off back and forth but you
[1:04:39] didn't say God
[1:04:41] you know what I say their soul if you'll
[1:04:43] save their soul we don't have to worry
[1:04:44] about that
[1:04:50] the Bible said virtue went out of him
[1:04:52] that's right congregation says amen if
[1:04:55] we're going to be like him we must have
[1:04:58] virtue then we must have it to be like
[1:05:00] him first song I ever loved to him was
[1:05:03] to be like Jesus well I'm going I'm if
[1:05:06] I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to
[1:05:08] have virtue and a past that it can pass
[1:05:11] forward from me to the people
[1:05:14] because virtue went out of him to the
[1:05:17] people virtue and before you can let it
[1:05:19] out you got to have it first amen you
[1:05:22] haven't got it it won't come out there's
[1:05:24] nothing for it to come out of
[1:05:27] it what if someone tried to draw first
[1:05:29] you out of us in the chat would return
[1:05:30] insufficient funds see no no
[1:05:33] none there to draw from check bounced
[1:05:35] somebody looking at you as a Christian
[1:05:37] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[1:05:39] on like a sinner there's not much virtue
[1:05:41] can be drawn from that see right
[1:05:44] virtue must be in US yes
[1:05:47] and until we get virtue then when we get
[1:05:49] true virtue we can add it to our faith
[1:05:52] that's the next foundation wall first
[1:05:54] you must have the faith now listen I
[1:05:55] read you this quote long time ago
[1:05:57] prophet of God said faith alone won't do
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:01] faith alone won't do it you can stay a
[1:06:03] Christian you can be a Christian but
[1:06:05] you're just going to be defeated all the
[1:06:06] time I'm sorry you're just going to be
[1:06:08] defeated all the time if you don't grow
[1:06:11] into some of these virtues
[1:06:13] I'm sorry
[1:06:16] this is the way God set it up not me
[1:06:19] I just thank God that he sent us a
[1:06:21] prophet that could give us the ABCs and
[1:06:23] how to do this all right how to approach
[1:06:26] God I believe brother round I don't care
[1:06:27] if they call him whatever they want to
[1:06:29] call him he he gave me the ability to
[1:06:31] approach God in a way that's the truth
[1:06:35] did he you
[1:06:37] brought Clarity to me he didn't he
[1:06:40] didn't bring uh well I just believe
[1:06:42] brother Brown was a prophet I just
[1:06:43] believe him no you gotta have faith you
[1:06:45] got to believe that God sent him
[1:06:47] and that second part of that was what to
[1:06:50] reveal to me the mystery truce to get me
[1:06:53] out of here
[1:06:54] not just make me a good Christian
[1:06:56] brother Brown from 47 to 63 that's what
[1:06:59] he was doing he was hammering be a good
[1:07:01] Christian get better get back to the
[1:07:02] word of God get back get these virtues
[1:07:04] working in your life
[1:07:05] because when did he preach this remember
[1:07:07] he preached that you perfect man when
[1:07:11] just a second 1962.
[1:07:13] this is before the seals broke
[1:07:17] so in other words you got to have these
[1:07:19] virtues before you the seals break if
[1:07:22] brother Branham needed these virtues
[1:07:23] before that then you and I obviously are
[1:07:25] going to have to have the same thing
[1:07:27] that's why they're so important but why
[1:07:29] they're so ill-taught you don't hear
[1:07:30] many people preaching on them you know
[1:07:32] why because they can't live it
[1:07:34] and they don't think it's important I
[1:07:36] had one preacher say one time that well
[1:07:38] that's not very important I thought okay
[1:07:40] well just throw the throw the throw the
[1:07:43] book of Peter out second whatever it is
[1:07:45] second Peter one we're gonna start
[1:07:47] throwing things out if that's not
[1:07:48] important let's throw this out that's
[1:07:49] not important let's throw that out
[1:07:51] I thought we supposed to I thought we
[1:07:54] supposed to be living what is already in
[1:07:55] there not trying to throw stuff out or
[1:07:58] or skip over and read something
[1:07:59] different
[1:08:00] virtue anyone knows that the word virtue
[1:08:02] means seeing it must have you must have
[1:08:04] it we if virtue went out of him to heal
[1:08:06] the woman that was sick he's expecting
[1:08:09] the same virtue in his church
[1:08:12] same virtue in his church because he was
[1:08:15] our example and if he had virtue to give
[1:08:17] to the people he expects us
[1:08:20] to have virtue to give to the people and
[1:08:23] what is virtue virtue is strength
[1:08:26] or power
[1:08:28] I want you to read we read this quote
[1:08:30] the other day but I want you to read it
[1:08:31] in that big bold letters down there
[1:08:33] brother Brown said we got to have virtue
[1:08:35] we got to have virtue we've got to have
[1:08:36] virtue and after you have virtue you
[1:08:37] must after you have faith you must have
[1:08:39] virtue have virtue for the whole world
[1:08:43] wow
[1:08:45] have virtue for the whole world
[1:08:50] do you know the only thing holding this
[1:08:52] world together
[1:08:53] is me and you
[1:08:56] the wrath of God is about that far above
[1:08:59] us when we leave this place
[1:09:01] Katie Bar the Door
[1:09:03] if you're not from the south you won't
[1:09:04] understand what I just said but it's an
[1:09:07] old saying that uh Katie you better
[1:09:09] borrow the door because here comes the
[1:09:10] calvary all right then he talks about
[1:09:13] preaching the sermon we'll get to this
[1:09:14] right here and then we'll stop about 20
[1:09:16] years ago when Reverend Mr Lilly Lilly
[1:09:18] the pastor took it from a text where
[1:09:20] Jesus said consider the Lily how they
[1:09:22] neither tall or spin yet I say to you
[1:09:24] Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed
[1:09:27] like one look at the Lily comes from way
[1:09:29] down in the muck
[1:09:32] we come from way down in the muck
[1:09:37] and every minute of the day it has to be
[1:09:40] drawing from the Earth
[1:09:42] see what does it do with this virtue
[1:09:45] that it draws it gives it out
[1:09:49] it makes a beautiful sight for the
[1:09:51] admirer it opens itself for honey for
[1:09:54] the bee to come and get his part
[1:09:56] don't complain
[1:09:59] it's just got it to give out
[1:10:03] wow
[1:10:04] what if the bee come in there
[1:10:05] insufficient finds us we're laughing
[1:10:08] we're being beekeepers we laugh about
[1:10:09] you know we see flowers out in the in
[1:10:12] the yard and the garden and stuff and
[1:10:13] the bees are just going at it well some
[1:10:15] of these flowers that we put on graves
[1:10:17] are plastic
[1:10:19] and we're you know thinking like a bee
[1:10:21] we're gonna fly to this thing and it's
[1:10:22] open it looks like it's got pollen on it
[1:10:24] we go
[1:10:27] this ain't soft
[1:10:29] this ain't gonna
[1:10:30] ain't got nothing in it that's what he's
[1:10:32] saying there was no pollen to get
[1:10:33] insufficient funds what fake yeah
[1:10:37] fake
[1:10:38] that Little Beaver scratch his hand and
[1:10:40] say what kind of Lilly is that or what
[1:10:43] kind of flower is that
[1:10:45] never have they ever made honey out of a
[1:10:48] plastic flower
[1:10:49] hello somebody
[1:10:52] I'm talking about us I put on a show
[1:10:57] got your perfect man brother Brown said
[1:10:58] I see I said then the first thing you
[1:11:00] know that somebody loves to smell the
[1:11:02] odor he's continued on this story
[1:11:05] he ain't selfish
[1:11:07] he's got older
[1:11:09] all those plants that we see that the
[1:11:11] bees go to they don't open up and say oh
[1:11:13] here comes a bee
[1:11:15] no they open up and they just keep
[1:11:16] making they just keep making pollen keep
[1:11:19] making pollen and the bee just keeps
[1:11:21] taking it keeps making honey and a lot
[1:11:22] of y'all are enjoying that
[1:11:24] he's got older before he can give out
[1:11:27] odor he has to have it before he can
[1:11:29] give out honey he has to have it before
[1:11:31] he can give up Beauty he has to have it
[1:11:33] before you can give out virtue you have
[1:11:35] to have it so add to your faith virtue
[1:11:37] amen understand now watch what he said
[1:11:40] he just stopped right here everybody
[1:11:41] wake up just for a minute get off your
[1:11:44] phone or whatever you're doing back
[1:11:45] there you can't look at me and looking
[1:11:47] down the floor
[1:11:48] before you can give out virtue you have
[1:11:50] to have it touch not physical
[1:11:56] see he reversed back to the woman that
[1:11:58] touched His Garment
[1:12:00] she didn't touch him physically
[1:12:03] but she pulled out of him what she
[1:12:06] needed
[1:12:07] pulled
[1:12:09] she pulled out
[1:12:10] so let's look and see what the word pull
[1:12:12] means just for a second we'll close it
[1:12:14] in just a second the word pull to exert
[1:12:17] Force upon so as to cause or tend to
[1:12:20] cause motion toward the force
[1:12:24] boy think spiritual with me please for
[1:12:27] just a few minutes that is so profound
[1:12:31] God is pulling us to his power
[1:12:35] God is pulling us to his word he's
[1:12:39] pulling us to have virtue watch to draw
[1:12:42] apart to rander to tear to perform or
[1:12:45] carry out now this is one I want to look
[1:12:48] at right here to draw the supporter
[1:12:50] attention of to attract
[1:12:52] brother Branham what is the attraction
[1:12:54] on the mountain
[1:12:56] what are you looking for what are you
[1:12:57] looking at
[1:12:58] are you looking just to sit here and die
[1:13:01] get a gold star for being a message
[1:13:03] believer for 50 years
[1:13:05] you want a pen
[1:13:07] no I want to get out of here
[1:13:11] I want to get old ER
[1:13:14] they're all ready
[1:13:16] they ain't pretty
[1:13:19] but to attract what have you been
[1:13:20] attracted to the whole time you've been
[1:13:23] in this message and you just been
[1:13:24] attracted and got Blinded By the Light
[1:13:26] of William Branham
[1:13:29] put it all on him
[1:13:31] I hope not
[1:13:32] because watch this just real quick and
[1:13:34] then we'll close right here this is my
[1:13:35] thought he's talking about pulling it
[1:13:37] out of it now the remember water we're
[1:13:38] the third pull the three pulls for those
[1:13:40] of you that are new I think everybody
[1:13:41] here is a Believers so they know what I
[1:13:43] say it when I mean third pull brother
[1:13:45] Ryan was given a vision and he was told
[1:13:47] that different pulls what's a pull you
[1:13:49] pull
[1:13:51] he's pulling something have you ever
[1:13:53] tried to push a rope
[1:13:55] it will not go where you want it to go
[1:13:58] but if you pull it it will
[1:14:00] you pull that rope it'll come right here
[1:14:02] you try to push that rope into that hole
[1:14:04] it'll go like this and that's just the
[1:14:06] way me and you are if we decide we're
[1:14:07] going to push this thing
[1:14:09] pull
[1:14:11] number one was what
[1:14:12] the saying he'd take people's hand and
[1:14:15] you see the bumps and then when the
[1:14:16] bumps would go away
[1:14:18] you were healed hit pronounce you heal
[1:14:19] all right the second one was discernment
[1:14:23] and I wrote myself a note to remember to
[1:14:25] talk about this but what did discernment
[1:14:27] do
[1:14:28] it pulled out what was in your heart
[1:14:31] is that right
[1:14:33] woman comes up to the platform he said
[1:14:35] woman I don't know you you like a fine
[1:14:37] woman maybe he will say your spirit is
[1:14:40] welcome so you must be a Christian
[1:14:43] what's she doing he's pulling out
[1:14:44] information
[1:14:46] he feels the poor from her because
[1:14:48] sometimes he didn't he said hey you need
[1:14:49] to get saved
[1:14:51] not too long ago I was wrote one it was
[1:14:53] a brother come up to that he said uh
[1:14:55] brother Brown said oh I see you want to
[1:14:57] be saved he said you need to quit
[1:14:58] smoking first
[1:15:02] that man probably went I didn't know
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:06] no he didn't I mean he didn't say it
[1:15:08] that bold he just said hey I see that
[1:15:10] you're here and I see you're looking for
[1:15:11] for salvation he said but you smoke
[1:15:13] cigarettes he said you need to quit he
[1:15:16] said you need to pray to get that
[1:15:17] smoking demon off of you
[1:15:19] and so even we just went ahead and
[1:15:20] prayed for him but look so all that
[1:15:22] discernment was what he pulled out what
[1:15:23] was inside those people
[1:15:25] and they pulled from him because he said
[1:15:27] it's not me
[1:15:29] he said the Angels standing between me
[1:15:31] and you right now or he's no more than
[1:15:33] two feet away that Pillar of Fire
[1:15:36] that discernment pulled out what was
[1:15:39] inside of him and what was inside of the
[1:15:41] people
[1:15:43] so to me that's what we're under you say
[1:15:45] now we're third poor people listen third
[1:15:47] pull is the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:15:49] if not the word of God's Discerning you
[1:15:51] right the word of God is what's doing
[1:15:53] the Discerning I mean it's like brother
[1:15:55] Dale said you don't have much
[1:15:56] discernment when people people look at
[1:15:57] you kind of angry and then look down and
[1:15:59] look away they can't look in the face
[1:16:02] but what's it doing you've come under
[1:16:04] listen you've come under the anointing
[1:16:06] of the Holy Ghost you come under the
[1:16:08] anointing of God himself
[1:16:10] not a second person or a third person
[1:16:12] you not come under the anointing of the
[1:16:13] message of the hour either
[1:16:16] well that made you quiet
[1:16:18] you come under the anointing of the Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost
[1:16:20] which is going to lead you to the
[1:16:23] message of the hour
[1:16:24] and give you all truth yes but we're
[1:16:28] under the discernment stage now we're
[1:16:30] going to you're going what did I tell
[1:16:32] you
[1:16:32] what I tell you beginning of the year
[1:16:34] let it out listen you either gonna let
[1:16:37] it out or God's gonna pull it out one of
[1:16:39] the two
[1:16:41] so we come under the second pole which
[1:16:42] is white deserman and then the third
[1:16:44] pull was what something he said no one
[1:16:46] can imitate this
[1:16:48] remember they imitated the first one
[1:16:50] they imitated the second one
[1:16:52] he said carnal impersonations everywhere
[1:16:56] he said but that third pool was what
[1:16:58] that was the opening of those seals
[1:16:59] that's where no man had ever been before
[1:17:02] that's when the son of man Ministry
[1:17:05] began in brother Brown's life
[1:17:10] believe it if you want to if you don't
[1:17:11] say man it means you don't believe it
[1:17:13] against
[1:17:14] daddy does because he's been preaching
[1:17:16] he's back there saying amen
[1:17:19] now we talked about Jesus for a minute
[1:17:20] let me get to something right here
[1:17:23] and then we'll close musicians come on
[1:17:28] talk about Peter and John
[1:17:30] they came to the gate beautiful
[1:17:33] and what was going on in their life is
[1:17:34] they were taught by the word of God
[1:17:38] they were taught all those years by the
[1:17:40] word of God you're gonna play in
[1:17:41] Maryland aren't you good job thank you
[1:17:43] that's good that you're about to let him
[1:17:45] do that you come up here and play
[1:17:47] something else
[1:17:48] there's nothing else to play okay
[1:17:51] well Ryan you play the bass
[1:17:54] not yet you've been practicing haven't
[1:17:56] you now's a good time to practice
[1:18:00] what are you laughing about you go play
[1:18:04] but look
[1:18:11] virtue himself
[1:18:13] and they walked with him and brother
[1:18:15] John they didn't understand and they
[1:18:16] probably looked at us like some people
[1:18:17] look at you and go what's he talking
[1:18:19] about because always they're going what
[1:18:21] are you talking about
[1:18:22] he talks to us in Parables what's going
[1:18:24] on here but I promise you we're not Holy
[1:18:26] Ghost because remember God said Jesus
[1:18:28] said hold on
[1:18:29] you may not
[1:18:33] understand go to Jerusalem and wait
[1:18:36] to you and dude with power from old high
[1:18:38] dunamis you're gonna understand what
[1:18:40] I've been telling you and then what
[1:18:42] you're going to do you're gonna be the
[1:18:44] one that's gonna preach it to the other
[1:18:45] people
[1:18:46] because out of that one man came 120
[1:18:49] little jesuses and those 120 little
[1:18:52] Jesus's birth 3 000 on this day of
[1:18:54] Pentecost and there's no telling where
[1:18:56] they went the disciples went all over
[1:18:58] the world what preaching him preaching
[1:19:01] Jesus Christ
[1:19:03] that's what we need to get to preach
[1:19:05] Jesus Christ first
[1:19:08] because Peter looked at him fast his
[1:19:09] eyes on him and said look on us
[1:19:12] wasn't in a prayer line didn't have to
[1:19:15] go pray up didn't have to call the
[1:19:16] pastor
[1:19:18] look at us
[1:19:20] Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:19:23] but such as I have
[1:19:25] give eye to thee
[1:19:27] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:19:30] rise up and walk listen
[1:19:33] rise up and walk and took him by the
[1:19:35] hand and guess what
[1:19:37] immediately his feet and ankles receive
[1:19:39] what strength that's where that strength
[1:19:41] come from Peter and John
[1:19:43] The Virtue that they have they let it
[1:19:45] out and here it come and it hit that man
[1:19:47] right where he needed to hit that sister
[1:19:48] right where she needed it it hit all
[1:19:51] those brothers and sisters all the ones
[1:19:52] in the prayer line that virtue hit them
[1:19:54] right where they needed it
[1:19:56] brother Brown said you need salvation
[1:19:58] you need healing you got you know you
[1:20:00] got cancer you you got a broken up home
[1:20:02] you
[1:20:03] he was bringing he was pulling it out of
[1:20:05] him saying hey this is what's wrong with
[1:20:07] you that's what he's doing now we don't
[1:20:10] have to be in a prayer line tell us
[1:20:12] what's wrong with us
[1:20:13] today is Discerning by the thoughts and
[1:20:15] intents of the heart is Discerning from
[1:20:18] what the pulpit
[1:20:20] and you praying to God
[1:20:23] we didn't get to we'll get to the
[1:20:25] to the seals because there's a there's a
[1:20:28] power that was released
[1:20:30] in those first three Church ages there
[1:20:32] was two Powers there was one power of
[1:20:34] the devil and one power of God and those
[1:20:36] same powers are here today
