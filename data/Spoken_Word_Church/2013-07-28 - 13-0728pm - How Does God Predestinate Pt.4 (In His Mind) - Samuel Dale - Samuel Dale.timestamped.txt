[30:39] brother Joe and and can get you know
[30:42] a copy off of it or something but now we
[30:45] we get pretty pretty informal and we we
[30:49] call names in that one you know we we
[30:52] try to be nice here you know because
[30:53] you're doing but in there we might tell
[30:56] you who's preaching What doctrine but
[30:58] you know we try to be fairly nice anyway
[31:01] all right but amen Romans 8.
[31:05] any other announcements I really enjoyed
[31:08] the kids really appreciate them
[31:11] kids that are doing because that's
[31:14] that's training them up to where that
[31:17] they're doing their jobs early
[31:19] wouldn't like us without doing the wrong
[31:21] things so we're doing with that amen
[31:24] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[31:26] this day and your love unto us and thank
[31:28] you for all things truly thank you
[31:31] Father for these children who have the
[31:32] desire in their heart to serve you and
[31:35] to sing and to worship and talk about
[31:38] you
[31:39] and we pray that you'd bless them in all
[31:42] their doings or schoolings their life to
[31:44] things you take care of them Lord we
[31:47] commit them into your hands believing
[31:48] that you are
[31:50] the protection The Shield all that's
[31:53] ever needed
[31:54] and we just pray you've got each one
[31:56] have your way now in the service as we
[31:58] read your word you come and speak to our
[32:00] hearts and direct us into what to say to
[32:02] your people we love you and we thank you
[32:04] in Jesus name
[32:06] amen
[32:14] verse 28.
[32:16] Romans 8 and we know that all things
[32:19] work together for good to them who love
[32:22] God to them who are the called according
[32:24] to his purpose
[32:25] for whom he did for no
[32:28] now
[32:29] I tell you that when I read the
[32:31] scriptures I read it
[32:33] as understanding of
[32:36] fitting it together with the entire
[32:38] Bible so even the scripture itself will
[32:41] tell you if you read it correctly
[32:43] see
[32:45] for whom he did for no
[32:49] for knowledge see
[32:51] all right
[32:53] he also did predestinate after he knew
[32:58] what to be conformed to the image of his
[33:02] son here on Earth all right see
[33:05] that he might be the firstborn among
[33:07] many brethren
[33:08] moreover whom he did predestinate
[33:11] already
[33:13] then he also he called
[33:17] in whom he called
[33:19] them he also justified in whom he
[33:22] justified them he also glorified what
[33:25] shall we say then to these things if God
[33:28] be for us who can be against us and then
[33:31] you may be seated the Lord that is
[33:33] blessing to the reading of the word
[33:42] now we've spent three messages on
[33:44] foreknowledge
[33:46] and bringing it down because I swear I
[33:48] believe that the prophet of God is
[33:50] explaining it to us but then we can say
[33:54] you know and and I think this way so
[33:57] forgive me
[33:58] uh
[33:59] we can say brother random said it the
[34:01] Bible said it
[34:03] and and we can do that because of a
[34:07] um
[34:07] influenced by somebody or something that
[34:10] has directed our thoughts
[34:13] uh into certain channels and ways of
[34:17] thinking you know and and and that's
[34:20] that's good because we need that
[34:24] but see I think what we need is a
[34:27] revelation
[34:29] see Dennis if you've got a revelation
[34:32] you don't care what anybody says you
[34:36] know I mean you can bring me any quote
[34:38] or anything you know that brother
[34:39] randomly said on predestination and
[34:42] things and let's see how it goes in with
[34:45] the the entire picture and we'll paint a
[34:49] picture but when you just have something
[34:51] that you bring in and say well well you
[34:53] know that he must have been wrong there
[34:56] or he wouldn't have said it like that
[34:58] you know well the Bible says over here
[35:01] to be baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost
[35:03] so Peter that was Jesus
[35:06] but Peter said you know over here
[35:10] he said well I'm going to take what
[35:12] Jesus said
[35:15] well that's the way people think
[35:17] and see when you're doing it like that
[35:18] then you're in Mass confusion because
[35:21] you cut off the complete revelation
[35:24] but to us see then we believe what
[35:27] father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ
[35:30] no problem is it very simple in the word
[35:33] of God once it's
[35:36] revealed to us so then I pray to God
[35:39] that he'll speak to your heart
[35:41] and I've always said I don't even try to
[35:43] get my wife to believe what I believe
[35:45] I don't try to get my kids to believe
[35:47] what I believe
[35:49] you know the grandkids the great
[35:51] grandkids and all of them
[35:53] all of that I I but daughter-in-laws and
[35:56] son-in-law I want them to have their
[35:59] revelation
[36:01] and then if pop goes on then you don't
[36:04] have to worry about it but if you're
[36:06] only built on pop then when Pop Goes you
[36:08] go
[36:09] right so then that's what's caused the
[36:12] confusion around the message if people
[36:14] are built on one certain person and then
[36:17] when they pass on or something happens
[36:18] they go into sin or something then it's
[36:21] just flop you know because the people
[36:24] don't have the revelation
[36:26] all right now
[36:29] but I want you to think about this
[36:30] afternoon I want a background just to
[36:32] her
[36:33] and then we'll move on with a thought
[36:38] that we've been covering that God does
[36:41] not predestinate even by his own desires
[36:45] because he desired to all be saved all
[36:49] right but he predestinates by his
[36:51] foreknowledge
[36:53] okay
[36:56] and by that for knowledge
[36:59] he can see who would be saved and who
[37:02] wouldn't
[37:04] and thereby then he could write down
[37:07] and put in his word
[37:09] you know what Jacob would do and Esau
[37:11] would do
[37:14] that way he's not predetermining it
[37:18] the person that made the choice is
[37:21] predetermining their outcome
[37:24] are you with me
[37:26] see what we choose the way we think and
[37:30] the way we do we choose our destiny
[37:32] right
[37:34] God won't override your free moral
[37:36] agency
[37:38] I'm a firm believer in that
[37:41] a lot of people in the message even say
[37:43] we don't believe in three more agency
[37:44] well then you're out of the word of God
[37:46] and you're out of the prophet's message
[37:48] because he said he believed
[37:52] he said he believed it
[37:54] so why can't we believe it all right see
[37:57] then that way we we take what we want
[38:01] you know and leave aside what we don't
[38:03] want
[38:04] and you know
[38:06] and like a man was telling me one time
[38:10] he said you ought to just take it
[38:12] um they really call it might have been
[38:14] reading close this morning but is he the
[38:16] First Corinthians or one up in there you
[38:18] know where it talks right close where it
[38:20] talks about the gifts
[38:22] in a different thing he said you're just
[38:24] tired that out of the Bible
[38:27] I said okay
[38:30] just let me have your Bible
[38:34] well he wouldn't do it
[38:36] you know he knew me
[38:38] and I'd have done it I'd have just took
[38:41] them pages and pulled her out
[38:44] I went and bought him a brand new Bible
[38:46] but uh if that's what he meant then
[38:49] we'll do it you know
[38:52] see I believe all of the word of God is
[38:54] perfect and correct
[38:56] I believe it's got to be revealed
[38:59] it's not just
[39:01] how many quotes we can have
[39:04] right it's not how many thoughts we can
[39:06] have
[39:07] is what God can reveal to you and I
[39:10] all right
[39:11] see then we we got down this morning now
[39:14] this is
[39:16] I say a background just a little bit on
[39:18] the afternoon
[39:19] because every service
[39:22] I try when I get into series
[39:25] I try to keep backing up on to the point
[39:29] bring it through
[39:31] because that way I want your mind to
[39:33] stay on
[39:35] the uh
[39:36] the thought and you can make the choice
[39:40] me you know the Bible does say choose
[39:42] you this day
[39:43] all right
[39:45] but we were looking down where the
[39:46] Prophet will bring these up
[39:49] that we were looking where the Prophet
[39:51] said
[39:53] from the resurrection of Jesus in 1956.
[39:58] that predestination looks back to
[40:00] foreknowledge
[40:01] and foreknowledge looks to Destiny they
[40:03] got these up so they'll bring them
[40:07] he didn't want
[40:09] well let's just read it they got it up
[40:14] and God in the beginning could see all
[40:17] things the way it would happen
[40:19] therefore he could tell
[40:21] this will be this way and that'll be
[40:23] that way and this will be this way
[40:25] in that that way because
[40:28] he by foreknowledge he wasn't willing
[40:32] that the left side would be wrong
[40:34] that this would be he didn't want that
[40:37] to happen but being God he knew it would
[40:39] happen that way so therefore he could
[40:42] foretell what would be he knew the end
[40:47] from the beginning amen he could
[40:49] foretell it now
[40:52] think about
[40:53] this and you'll see it Garrett gaining
[40:55] ground in a moment
[40:57] he could foretell it
[41:01] um
[41:01] not just foresee
[41:04] so he would foretell it
[41:07] now
[41:09] I believe
[41:11] this is what he's talking about
[41:12] foretelling the Bible
[41:16] so God could foretell it could have it
[41:19] written
[41:21] I also believe that this Bible
[41:25] was written before the foundation of the
[41:27] world Amen
[41:28] all right
[41:30] then it came to Earth to be written by
[41:33] mankind
[41:35] see that would make the word Eternal you
[41:38] said well man which version do you have
[41:40] brother Dale
[41:45] I like those
[41:47] uh
[41:50] I'm accused of being sarcastic so I like
[41:52] that you know people being sarcastic
[41:55] which version do you want to use
[41:59] well I'm sorry this is just the way I
[42:02] think
[42:04] God came down through a prophet and
[42:07] Vindicated
[42:08] the King James version
[42:11] because that was the one he used
[42:14] it now what you like about it I don't
[42:16] give a hoot I'm just telling you what I
[42:18] think
[42:19] he Vindicated that he didn't vindicate
[42:22] good news for Modern Man
[42:25] you didn't vindicate those
[42:29] but he Vindicated to King James Version
[42:32] well you know what
[42:33] none of the ends and the butts the
[42:35] prophet sits in the right place
[42:37] so why couldn't we believe that
[42:39] the King James version was
[42:42] what was in heaven
[42:47] you know got a couple of servers and if
[42:49] you hit it knotted but you know
[42:52] I just tell you what I believe
[42:54] that well you don't have to worry about
[42:56] it
[42:57] but see
[42:59] I believed in God
[43:01] could write down
[43:04] now he didn't have to pin it
[43:07] that's what we look at like God wrote
[43:09] before the world you know he didn't have
[43:12] to pin things down
[43:14] he brought mankind upon the Earth
[43:19] he put the Bible in the Stars
[43:23] right
[43:25] then he brought it on down to the
[43:27] prophets writing the word
[43:33] what was in God's mind the prophet said
[43:35] is now in the bride of Christ
[43:39] all right now which is the word of God
[43:42] all right so that's how much I believe
[43:44] it
[43:46] I don't
[43:48] I know I say things sometimes that are
[43:52] I guess hard to understand I don't mean
[43:53] that because I'm so smart it's just how
[43:56] dumb I am
[43:57] but
[43:59] see what do you believe about for
[44:01] knowledge
[44:06] well I believe it was God for you
[44:10] well you know if we believe that he's
[44:12] infinite
[44:14] we know everything is right and works
[44:16] and it'll be that way
[44:18] but
[44:21] you don't never try to think about the
[44:23] mind of God
[44:27] and how great it is
[44:35] you know
[44:38] I believe
[44:41] that God in his foreknowledge
[44:46] knew that I would marry my wife
[44:49] we would have three children
[44:52] five grandkids
[44:54] we got two great-grandkids now
[44:57] I believe he knew that
[45:00] and I believe that it's transpired but
[45:01] you know what we had to live the life to
[45:03] make it fulfilled all right
[45:05] but what about an infinite God
[45:10] I'm sorry but this is the way I think
[45:11] I've tried to explain this before and
[45:14] people laughed at me
[45:17] I believe God knows
[45:23] and would have the capability of knowing
[45:27] that if I didn't marry my wife and I
[45:29] married another woman
[45:30] and had kids he could know that
[45:42] are you going to limit his in in
[45:44] infinite
[45:47] but we know it's not going to happen why
[45:49] because it's the way it happened
[45:52] me
[45:53] but see we limit him by making our
[45:57] thoughts
[46:00] try to line up to something
[46:04] he then we we we get into a situations
[46:07] as we were talking about this morning
[46:09] and where the man asked for
[46:12] time and God gave him 15 years that's
[46:15] right
[46:19] God knew
[46:21] we know that
[46:24] now he knew he was going to give him 15
[46:26] years before the world he wrote that in
[46:28] the word
[46:29] right
[46:31] but you know he knew what would have
[46:33] happened if that man would have died and
[46:35] the prophet said it would have been
[46:36] better if the man had died
[46:40] he said cause he put Israel in a bad
[46:43] place
[46:46] see
[46:47] we don't
[46:49] you know
[46:51] the infinite mind
[46:55] we don't allow him to be able to know
[47:00] everything
[47:03] and we think we pull things over on him
[47:05] you know
[47:06] but we're not gonna pull anything over
[47:08] on God he knows
[47:10] but he's infinite forgive me for that if
[47:13] you don't like that illustration that's
[47:15] all right I'm just telling you how I
[47:17] believe infinite is
[47:21] that that way I put no limit
[47:24] upon
[47:26] the God that I serve
[47:29] I ain't trying to figure it out either I
[47:32] just live my life
[47:36] I've enjoyed
[47:39] you know just being who I am and
[47:42] and coming in this message and believing
[47:44] it and giving that opportunity
[47:47] I I just I see the god that that when I
[47:50] was about 11 years old I saw women
[47:54] always wanted to see him after then
[47:57] but
[47:59] when the prophet began to talk about God
[48:02] I begin to see the one I saw
[48:05] you know it's all right it doesn't make
[48:07] anything out of me
[48:09] one of these days I'm going to preach on
[48:10] the gifts and callings of God being
[48:12] without repentance
[48:13] and how faithful Ministry is
[48:15] predestinated eternally
[48:22] okay
[48:24] because see I believe the word
[48:28] but foreknowledge the prophet said
[48:30] predestination looks back to
[48:32] foreknowledge
[48:34] see then that means foreknowledge is
[48:36] before predestination
[48:39] now that clears up to me now that clears
[48:42] up the problem of whether or not he
[48:45] stamped it is that's the way it's going
[48:48] to be
[48:49] and I can't change it
[48:55] see then I see that sister Gail that
[48:58] it's a life that I've lived
[49:01] is my foreknowledge
[49:05] you know
[49:06] and through this life that I lived which
[49:09] has been a very horrible one as far as
[49:11] Christianity I would agree with you
[49:13] but yet still I've searched for God
[49:18] along for a God that
[49:20] always believe was real
[49:24] not just
[49:26] satisfied with going to church
[49:29] you know and be good
[49:33] and I want you to see God for yourself
[49:38] and seeing that away that
[49:40] you can see that you can look back in
[49:43] your life sit down sometimes and just
[49:45] think of your life
[49:49] we've got to think about the horrible
[49:50] things that we've done in life to go
[49:52] along with it yes
[49:54] but we don't want to dwell on the
[49:56] horrible side
[49:59] we want to dwell on maybe somewhere down
[50:01] through there a little contact was made
[50:05] a little something that you saw and
[50:08] and then I wouldn't take a thing in the
[50:10] world far
[50:15] I've used this to Gail because I know
[50:16] she doesn't mind it because she was
[50:18] vacuuming one day and
[50:21] and she just saw one God
[50:27] that's that to me that's greater than
[50:30] anything you could ever think of in your
[50:32] life
[50:34] a million dollars
[50:36] what good is that anymore
[50:40] you know
[50:42] he said well I'd like to have it next
[50:44] week it might be gone you better enjoy
[50:47] it if you get it you know
[50:52] but think about it
[50:54] see then for knowledge
[50:57] is a greater thing than predestination
[51:03] because by that foreknowledge he can
[51:06] predestinate
[51:08] and he doesn't choose as we read her in
[51:11] one of the messages this morning
[51:15] he doesn't choose
[51:18] we are doing the choosing
[51:21] yes but brother Dale that don't make me
[51:23] feel good because the heat show that
[51:25] makes me feel real good
[51:28] to know that I did want him
[51:32] I did desire him
[51:36] I wanted to know about him
[51:39] yes no
[51:43] maybe it comes because it raised up the
[51:45] way we was because
[51:46] you know was raised forward
[51:49] and then you know didn't have ability to
[51:51] get an education
[51:53] no
[51:55] but
[51:57] you say Well it wouldn't do you no good
[51:59] it might not have but I had more sense
[52:01] maybe I could explain myself a little
[52:03] better if I'd got an education
[52:05] but I can't so you just have to put up
[52:07] with that
[52:09] but what about it now
[52:13] God didn't say I'm going to choose you
[52:19] and I'm going to send this person to
[52:21] help
[52:24] he didn't do it that way
[52:26] he wanted all to come to Heaven that's
[52:29] in Abraham's in his seat after him
[52:33] he wanted all of us to come to heaven
[52:39] but he knew
[52:42] that's where I tell you the doctrines
[52:45] and people look at you and wonder we'll
[52:47] go check them out
[52:49] the Mormon Doctrine
[52:52] is an odd Doctrine
[52:54] because in the Mormon Doctrine you have
[52:57] Satan and you have Jesus as two
[53:00] opposings
[53:01] and they're presenting to God a plan to
[53:04] bring all mankind to Earth because we
[53:07] were all up there with God dwelling
[53:09] that's their Doctrine
[53:12] and uh
[53:14] Satan had an idea or doctrine to save
[53:16] everybody
[53:19] well Jesus had a Doctrine to save only
[53:21] certain people
[53:24] well that would make the devil a whole
[53:26] lot more greater than
[53:28] than God
[53:29] you know
[53:31] see that's their Doctrine
[53:34] not realizing you exalt Satan to the
[53:36] Apex instead of God
[53:39] but God wouldn't all be saved
[53:42] he never created one person that he
[53:45] didn't want to be saved
[53:48] and that's why I love the prophet where
[53:50] his explanation he said every person we
[53:54] read this one
[53:55] ever son in the world was a son of God
[53:59] that doesn't mean by New Birth
[54:03] that means the fact that we were created
[54:08] her mom and daddy didn't create us
[54:11] even if they had brought bodies it
[54:13] wouldn't have been no good
[54:15] the soul in the spirit couldn't dwell
[54:17] you know wouldn't add anything
[54:19] God wants everybody to be saved
[54:22] you say he hated Esau did he hate
[54:28] see we read the word as we are talked to
[54:32] find it
[54:35] is that word that God just
[54:39] hanging
[54:41] you know
[54:43] I just hate him
[54:47] no how can God hate
[54:52] what is in there in God that
[54:56] he can hate
[54:59] he said he knows good and evil now how
[55:01] can he know evil other than knowing
[55:03] about evil
[55:07] he even said he created maybe evil how
[55:09] can he do that
[55:13] where's anything out of him to be able
[55:15] to create
[55:16] where's it any hatred
[55:19] that he could have
[55:21] for Esau
[55:27] the greatest hatred God could have
[55:30] would be the smallest amount of love you
[55:32] and I could think about
[55:36] but see we think well the word says that
[55:42] look
[55:45] where can you put anything like that in
[55:47] God
[55:49] I just I wonder about them
[55:54] he says in the message adoption
[55:59] for knowledge therefore if he by
[56:02] foreknowledge knew who would be saved
[56:04] who and who would not be saved he could
[56:07] predestinate
[56:09] you remember all the others where he was
[56:11] using he said
[56:13] that predestinate was a bad word look
[56:16] what he says here
[56:19] 1965-22
[56:22] he said the word's not sure such a bad
[56:24] word after all
[56:27] see once you understand
[56:30] it's not a bad word
[56:32] all right
[56:35] but we need to lay everything as he said
[56:37] on down there aside
[56:41] and look straight to God
[56:44] all right just getting a little
[56:45] background
[56:47] go to the next one while you bring them
[56:49] up patma's vision
[56:53] of Atmos Vision 60 1205
[56:57] 1204. evening
[57:00] I truly believe that the remnant is
[57:02] chosen by God I believe it that God
[57:04] chose to Remnant before the foundation
[57:06] of the world
[57:07] and has by his foreknowledge
[57:10] not the word now watch the predestinate
[57:12] the God is a stingy little word amongst
[57:16] the people see
[57:18] but God before the foundation of the
[57:20] world in his great infinite mind
[57:23] shows the bride
[57:25] chose Jesus
[57:27] chose the church
[57:29] and could predict at the beginning what
[57:33] it would be at the end
[57:36] he if he says when it there's nothing
[57:40] what he did not know he knowed every fly
[57:43] everfully excuse me
[57:46] never be on earth and how many times as
[57:48] bad as I
[57:49] go out all the time and I don't like
[57:51] fleas and flies and mosquitoes
[57:56] which is everywhere excuse me and he
[57:59] thought he knowed every one of them
[58:03] and you know what probably if you run a
[58:06] record back to find out they would every
[58:08] one of them have a
[58:10] some personality or some part about them
[58:12] that would be different
[58:15] you know and all the snowflakes that
[58:16] fall in the world there's never too
[58:19] identically the same
[58:26] always amazed me how that
[58:31] a little old gnat
[58:33] come from a germ
[58:37] and a big old elephant
[58:40] come and adjourn another same size
[58:45] at the beginning
[58:47] that was amazed me
[58:50] but listen
[58:54] God being infinite
[58:57] he knew the end from the beginning
[58:58] therefore he knew what people would do
[59:01] so he could foretell
[59:04] that's all for the faith of Abraham
[59:07] 55 11 18.
[59:09] he could foretell what would take place
[59:12] for he knew
[59:14] what would be
[59:17] for knowledge
[59:20] it's the point of four knowledge
[59:25] the next one go ahead and pull up number
[59:27] six
[59:28] that's what I'm talking about this
[59:29] morning the little bird
[59:32] and that little bird thought he could
[59:35] you know
[59:37] why
[59:38] he's just as smart as the human
[59:42] you know
[59:45] but when the man coming around using the
[59:47] big words
[59:48] he found out he didn't know very much
[59:51] and he's Compares that with us thinking
[59:54] about
[59:55] the infinite Mind Of God is so far
[59:58] beyond human intellectuals
[1:00:01] until it would never be
[1:00:04] the best we could do
[1:00:06] would compare with nothing of his
[1:00:08] infinite mind
[1:00:13] so we just got to believe
[1:00:16] and let it go from there
[1:00:18] all right now
[1:00:21] the mind of God
[1:00:24] what do you think about the mind of God
[1:00:29] and before I start with anything I want
[1:00:31] to say this point as I've ended and
[1:00:33] mentioned a little this morning
[1:00:37] Judah says Garrett was in the mind of
[1:00:39] God
[1:00:43] but that didn't make him eternal
[1:00:48] Esau I was in the mind of God so we're
[1:00:50] going to read in a minute the mind of
[1:00:51] God is the Bible the word
[1:00:56] so Esau was in the mind of God just as
[1:00:59] well as Jacob
[1:01:04] right then
[1:01:08] it doesn't make you Eternal just to be
[1:01:11] in the mind of God
[1:01:16] that's what everybody in the message
[1:01:17] preaches we're in the mind we were in
[1:01:19] the mind of God so that makes me eternal
[1:01:21] it doesn't make it Eternal because
[1:01:23] you're in the mind of God
[1:01:26] because everybody'd ever be in the world
[1:01:27] was in the mind of God
[1:01:35] and in that mind now here's what we got
[1:01:38] to deal with
[1:01:39] so hold on a little bit
[1:01:44] in God's mind is his foreknowledge
[1:01:51] correct your mind is what you are
[1:01:55] right what you think
[1:01:58] so now all of laying down going back to
[1:02:01] foreknowledge here we stand for
[1:02:03] knowledge
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:07] that is the mind of God
[1:02:13] his foreknowledge
[1:02:17] so in that way he could
[1:02:19] look down through time
[1:02:22] you can see everything
[1:02:25] he could predestinate
[1:02:28] everything
[1:02:31] predetermine it
[1:02:34] for ordain it
[1:02:38] because
[1:02:40] he would be dealing with his
[1:02:41] foreknowledge
[1:02:44] now so hold this afternoon the thought
[1:02:48] I told you we're going back further in
[1:02:50] another message or so
[1:02:53] but holding your thought
[1:02:55] the mind of God
[1:02:59] and in that way you can see that just
[1:03:02] because we're in the mind of God don't
[1:03:04] save us right right that's right
[1:03:07] because everybody'd ever come in the
[1:03:09] world was in the mind of God
[1:03:14] and the prophet of God said every person
[1:03:17] that ever come into the world was born
[1:03:20] with this great
[1:03:22] inward part of him he called it Faith
[1:03:25] one time
[1:03:27] that made him search for God
[1:03:33] you go to the foreign countries where
[1:03:35] they've never heard of Jesus in their
[1:03:38] worshiping idols
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:44] why
[1:03:47] because we are creation
[1:03:52] we know no matter what
[1:03:56] no matter how mean you are or what
[1:03:59] thoughts you are
[1:04:03] you you still got something in back in
[1:04:05] there
[1:04:09] a desire to serve God
[1:04:12] is what we were born with is that the
[1:04:14] way the prophet describes it
[1:04:17] everybody not just a bride
[1:04:20] I said whatever well I come with this
[1:04:23] desire to serve God so did everybody
[1:04:28] I mean did Judas join the crowd
[1:04:33] as a dirty crook now I know what the
[1:04:34] word says about it so don't worry about
[1:04:36] it
[1:04:37] that he was a thief from the beginning I
[1:04:38] know that
[1:04:40] was your thief the first day
[1:04:43] ready to become a thief
[1:04:45] as he went along
[1:04:52] Adolf Hitler is a little baby
[1:04:56] which is like any little baby
[1:05:01] no matter how mean the person you could
[1:05:03] think of
[1:05:04] they're born
[1:05:07] with us with this longing within them to
[1:05:12] find the god
[1:05:14] that created them
[1:05:17] so why is there so much put on
[1:05:19] but I come in the world Desiring to find
[1:05:21] him
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:25] so did everybody
[1:05:28] why there's so much talked about in the
[1:05:31] mind of God
[1:05:33] well in the mind of God with every
[1:05:35] person they would ever be in the world
[1:05:40] he thought of Judas this carrot this
[1:05:42] much he thought of you
[1:05:46] the same time he thought of Jesus coming
[1:05:48] on the earth he thought of Judas coming
[1:05:50] on the Earth
[1:05:55] well see we say if I was just in his
[1:05:57] mind that makes me eternal Now where's
[1:05:59] that in the prophet's message
[1:06:04] I know what he says about the Eternal
[1:06:06] talks of God
[1:06:10] I've got them at the end of the message
[1:06:15] but I'm just trying to lay something
[1:06:16] down to you to think about
[1:06:22] then take the four knowledge as we said
[1:06:25] here is from here that away where we're
[1:06:28] determining
[1:06:30] thanks to be
[1:06:32] and it comes out to be in the way that
[1:06:34] he thought of it
[1:06:37] but back up to where he was at in his
[1:06:39] thinking
[1:06:41] and in his mind
[1:06:43] at the same time
[1:06:45] that he thinks of you he thinks of
[1:06:48] everybody else that's in the world
[1:06:52] yeah but you just don't understand
[1:06:53] because God loves me
[1:06:59] according to my Bible he loves everybody
[1:07:03] I'm just sorry
[1:07:05] but that's the word
[1:07:08] was he talking about the mind of God
[1:07:11] he's got to look back as to something
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] you're wanting to to make his mind
[1:07:20] oh
[1:07:21] bring forth
[1:07:23] things
[1:07:26] when in his mind he just thought about
[1:07:28] what would be
[1:07:30] there's your foreknowledge
[1:07:35] his foreign
[1:07:38] in his thinking
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:42] he just sat down one day and he thought
[1:07:48] I'm going to create a world
[1:07:54] I'm going to create people
[1:08:01] and he said well what do they be
[1:08:05] well
[1:08:06] I'll create them as perfect as I can
[1:08:09] because he did Adam
[1:08:11] and Eve
[1:08:16] but in his mind he was thinking at the
[1:08:18] same time
[1:08:23] how can I display the attributes I have
[1:08:29] they ended up saying this morning he
[1:08:31] didn't gain attributes down through time
[1:08:32] he had attributes before the world ever
[1:08:35] give a gun even back when he was Elohim
[1:08:40] which the prophet gives the definition
[1:08:42] of Elohim is what
[1:08:45] self-existing when he existed alone
[1:08:52] all right now if he existed alone we
[1:08:55] didn't exist with him
[1:08:57] foreign
[1:09:01] eternal life existed with him
[1:09:04] and we'll get to it eventually the
[1:09:07] prophet said it's not the person that
[1:09:08] comes predestinated eternally from God
[1:09:10] it's the word or seed
[1:09:15] so when Martin Luther's are saying this
[1:09:16] morning
[1:09:18] when that crossed that path in time
[1:09:21] that God had seen it Martin Luther
[1:09:23] caught that message
[1:09:25] there was the seed of God coming to a
[1:09:28] man
[1:09:32] the man caught by Revelation and became
[1:09:35] what he was preaching
[1:09:38] or the just shall live by faith
[1:09:41] so then time and God's Eternal thoughts
[1:09:45] ran together
[1:09:48] what do you think is going to cause the
[1:09:50] end of the world or or the Rapture in a
[1:09:52] thing
[1:09:54] for 40 something years past the prophet
[1:09:56] bringing his message
[1:09:59] why are we here
[1:10:07] is because we haven't caught the message
[1:10:09] rights yet
[1:10:11] now we're waiting on somebody else oh
[1:10:13] ain't you nice
[1:10:19] I believe it was brother Branham I'm
[1:10:21] pretty sure he said if you want to find
[1:10:22] out how
[1:10:23] valuable you are
[1:10:26] he said take a bucket of water
[1:10:28] stick your finger in it and pull it back
[1:10:31] out
[1:10:35] and says you won't find no hole
[1:10:39] no man up and do all the cotton meal and
[1:10:41] a couple of boys he thought they'd run
[1:10:43] the plant years ago
[1:10:45] they got mad at him he just got his boy
[1:10:47] and walked out and said we'll shut this
[1:10:48] place down
[1:10:50] he went outside now this happened you
[1:10:52] know suppose the story was told he went
[1:10:54] outside to look and they just still
[1:10:56] working
[1:10:57] he told his boy you know we're not as
[1:10:59] important we thought we was
[1:11:02] but you see we try to build everything
[1:11:04] to to connect to something within us
[1:11:09] why not believe it's what's in him
[1:11:13] the Bible said he chose us in him
[1:11:17] it doesn't say
[1:11:19] he chose him and us
[1:11:24] the Adam come here with Eve in him
[1:11:29] but we want to preach
[1:11:31] that we come here with God in us
[1:11:38] oh I always was eternal
[1:11:45] you better start dealing with the fact
[1:11:47] that we're in Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] but get the point
[1:11:57] the word of God
[1:12:00] is God's mind placed in letter form
[1:12:07] and by that we can see the picture that
[1:12:10] he saw in his mind
[1:12:12] right right
[1:12:15] we can see that before the world he sat
[1:12:17] down he thought it out
[1:12:20] we'll read where the Prophet said in God
[1:12:23] it was not like a man with a blueprint
[1:12:26] that would finally become into being
[1:12:30] it's his thought
[1:12:32] but he knew when he created Adam
[1:12:34] and Eve
[1:12:36] the Dead Fall
[1:12:41] now he couldn't make them fall
[1:12:44] and display his attribute
[1:12:46] of a Healer or savior
[1:12:49] that'd make him wrong
[1:12:52] but he knew if he made them
[1:12:54] oh that Adam and Eve they had a man if
[1:12:57] if he just made me first
[1:13:04] I know everybody don't like me I'm not
[1:13:06] no politician
[1:13:07] anybody said man look what we've done
[1:13:09] voting Obama in if you'd put McCain in
[1:13:11] we've probably been in worser shape
[1:13:13] ain't nobody pull this out you want the
[1:13:15] profit put a George Washington Abraham
[1:13:17] Lincoln every office in the country you
[1:13:19] can't pull it out
[1:13:22] we just want to blame it on somebody
[1:13:26] let's just enjoy being here and have a
[1:13:28] good time
[1:13:30] don't worry about it
[1:13:33] because it ain't gonna be too well you
[1:13:35] know ain't long I think things are going
[1:13:37] to run out don't you
[1:13:39] but now think about it
[1:13:42] that God before the world he just
[1:13:46] looked down through time
[1:13:49] and he's seen everything that would ever
[1:13:51] transpire
[1:13:55] hers is foreknowledge
[1:13:58] you go any other way you're going to
[1:14:00] predetermine it now
[1:14:03] so in his mind
[1:14:06] Judas says Karen existed
[1:14:09] that didn't make him eternal
[1:14:12] but in his mind
[1:14:14] William Branham existed
[1:14:17] but that didn't make him eternal
[1:14:22] he had to come to Earth and receive the
[1:14:23] new birth
[1:14:31] see then that's the only way you can
[1:14:33] become Eternal is by the new birth
[1:14:36] but see then the mind of God is his
[1:14:39] foreknowledge
[1:14:41] I don't know I don't even know where I'm
[1:14:43] at in a note so forget it
[1:14:46] that mind is his foreknowledge
[1:14:49] or what else are you going to call it
[1:14:53] he foresaw
[1:14:55] for new
[1:14:58] then by foreseeing and foreknowing he
[1:15:00] could foreordain
[1:15:03] for things to transpire
[1:15:07] the Earth to be like it is and you and I
[1:15:10] to be sitting here today
[1:15:13] because this is a display of God's mind
[1:15:20] where we're at now
[1:15:21] see then he wrote of it
[1:15:25] put it in a book
[1:15:28] and gave it to us
[1:15:32] and watch what he said let's get it this
[1:15:34] is one yeah go ahead with number eight
[1:15:44] we'll do number seven but I like it
[1:15:46] he said he seen my baby sitting back
[1:15:49] under
[1:15:50] is he never a hungry person in India
[1:15:54] he's seen every preacher in the pulpit
[1:15:58] he's seen every hypocrite walking
[1:16:02] that's that's all the message
[1:16:04] word become flesh
[1:16:06] he's seen the whole thing all right but
[1:16:08] look
[1:16:10] of the message Perfection 56 16. e19 now
[1:16:15] look before he ever put the printed word
[1:16:20] and watch him he evidently held up the
[1:16:22] Bible
[1:16:23] because when we get down here
[1:16:25] he said and this is the mind of God
[1:16:30] here it is
[1:16:31] this is the mind of God that he thought
[1:16:33] before the foundational world
[1:16:36] was overlaid it is
[1:16:39] that's the reason he could put it on
[1:16:41] printed word
[1:16:43] and say what would be
[1:16:46] because he saw it before the
[1:16:48] foundational world and you just what it
[1:16:50] would be and spoke it out
[1:16:53] and then he handed down his
[1:16:55] knowledge
[1:16:58] to the prophets
[1:17:00] and they wrote it
[1:17:03] so he handed his foreknowledge
[1:17:08] knowledge
[1:17:11] to the prophets
[1:17:13] and they wrote it
[1:17:14] then the Bible is God's mind
[1:17:19] if you want to know anything about life
[1:17:22] or anything just read the Bible
[1:17:25] well I wonder about this and what about
[1:17:27] read the Bible
[1:17:28] now don't be dumb and stupid as some
[1:17:31] people are you know I ain't gonna turn
[1:17:33] over to acts 13 so and so and go buy me
[1:17:36] a
[1:17:37] car with it's got to have the serial
[1:17:39] number 13 in it
[1:17:41] we're not silly
[1:17:46] because they know that's not but getting
[1:17:48] the point of what he's saying the word
[1:17:51] of God
[1:17:53] is the mind of God been given to you and
[1:17:55] I
[1:17:56] that's why Paul could say
[1:17:59] he said I believe I held the mind to
[1:18:01] Christ
[1:18:02] what by the new birth that was within
[1:18:05] him
[1:18:08] come on
[1:18:10] he had the alive word living within him
[1:18:15] and thereby that's why he could
[1:18:18] take and was chosen to write basically
[1:18:22] the New Testament
[1:18:25] because of his knowledge of the Old
[1:18:27] Testament
[1:18:30] that's what he brought around says it
[1:18:33] and what about Paul now being chosen to
[1:18:37] write communion message
[1:18:40] and wasn't even there when they
[1:18:41] performed it
[1:18:43] looks like it'd have been Peter
[1:18:45] or some of them
[1:18:47] but no they couldn't take it and put it
[1:18:49] back in that word Paul could stand there
[1:18:51] and go right back in that Old Testament
[1:18:53] and bring that right down out of there
[1:18:54] and bring out that mind to them Prophets
[1:18:59] now brother random says
[1:19:02] that those prophets built the body of
[1:19:06] Jesus Christ you remember that
[1:19:10] he said you got everything
[1:19:11] Joseph is a foundational Masterpiece go
[1:19:14] to it
[1:19:15] he said then you got the prophets that
[1:19:17] built the body he said life was John the
[1:19:19] Baptist
[1:19:20] to come to introduce the head and the
[1:19:23] head was Christ
[1:19:24] all right
[1:19:27] so that's the mind of God
[1:19:31] that's how Moses
[1:19:35] could write of what happened in Genesis
[1:19:42] why because he picked up the mind of God
[1:19:46] he didn't just go out and sit down and
[1:19:48] hear all these fabled stories and
[1:19:51] and then he can cut him up away writing
[1:19:53] down things
[1:19:55] he picked up the mind of God
[1:20:00] I always say about tithing them
[1:20:03] Abraham told
[1:20:05] Melchizedek he said I'll give you a
[1:20:07] tenth
[1:20:08] well I guess God up in heaven said amen
[1:20:10] that's good I'm glad he said that that's
[1:20:12] a good point no that was before the
[1:20:14] world that he knew that was going to
[1:20:15] happen
[1:20:21] see that's the way I believe the word of
[1:20:22] God
[1:20:25] I believed that we don't need a new
[1:20:27] Bible when the prophet came he didn't
[1:20:29] come to give us a new Bible
[1:20:31] we didn't have to get a different
[1:20:33] versions and things
[1:20:35] we had it
[1:20:37] I have a ability to search
[1:20:40] uh 30-something
[1:20:43] translations 36.
[1:20:46] and I use it a lot
[1:20:49] because I like to see if they keep it
[1:20:51] together in their
[1:20:53] definitions from whey and Rheem and and
[1:20:56] and all the different ones you know
[1:21:02] because it helps me
[1:21:05] you get on marriage and divorce
[1:21:06] especially
[1:21:07] and then you want to see if those
[1:21:09] writers kept that right
[1:21:11] because they're not translating a lot of
[1:21:13] times from the King James they're
[1:21:14] translating from a lot of other things
[1:21:17] and that that way I see I believe we
[1:21:20] have
[1:21:21] the mind of God
[1:21:24] if you want to know anything start
[1:21:26] reading
[1:21:29] well I'd like to know what God has in
[1:21:31] mind for me start reading
[1:21:35] hmm
[1:21:39] I don't invite you to use it as a Ouija
[1:21:41] board
[1:21:44] but I do invite you to read it
[1:21:48] and you might even be able to figure out
[1:21:52] what you're doing
[1:21:54] by reading the word
[1:21:55] because he may speak to you from it
[1:21:58] to see something in life I believe that
[1:22:02] but I believe that's God's word that's
[1:22:04] God's mind
[1:22:06] that he's placed in there and that way
[1:22:09] then ours is for knowledge
[1:22:14] come on
[1:22:15] this is God's foreknowledge it tells
[1:22:18] before the world
[1:22:22] right
[1:22:25] it tells about that he was self-existing
[1:22:28] you know not in the words that we use
[1:22:30] but
[1:22:31] it gives you the wording and it tells
[1:22:34] all the way through and tells out to the
[1:22:36] end
[1:22:38] and the future home
[1:22:42] why do you won't know anything else
[1:22:47] what is anything else to know what a man
[1:22:50] sit at the house one day he said
[1:22:54] we believe we go out Beyond brother
[1:22:56] Brown
[1:22:58] okay
[1:23:01] okay you've got my own brother random
[1:23:02] okay
[1:23:04] brother random ass priest was all the
[1:23:07] way to the Future home
[1:23:11] I bet you telling me anything past there
[1:23:14] I'm honest I wasn't being hateful with
[1:23:17] him I was grinning I said tell me what's
[1:23:20] pie star if you're going to go beyond
[1:23:21] him he's done priests just to there
[1:23:27] he said ah you're just a smart alec well
[1:23:29] that's all right
[1:23:33] but listen folks
[1:23:36] do you see what I'm talking about
[1:23:38] you don't get nothing get the thought
[1:23:41] to see the Bible as the word of God
[1:23:45] it tells the beginning and the ending
[1:23:48] and even into
[1:23:49] eternity and tells us even what is right
[1:23:53] now taking place in heaven
[1:23:56] it tells us what's taking place in hell
[1:23:59] as we call it Shogun 80s
[1:24:02] it tells us everything
[1:24:08] and that's God's foreknowledge
[1:24:11] what's your thought brother Daley my
[1:24:13] thought is one thing
[1:24:16] if we back up to four knowledge
[1:24:19] and then we go out and we predetermine
[1:24:22] from that foreknowledge then we haven't
[1:24:25] messed up yet have we
[1:24:27] everything's based on these four
[1:24:28] knowledge
[1:24:30] that he foreknew
[1:24:32] now take the Bible and see that he wrote
[1:24:35] it
[1:24:38] to give it to us
[1:24:40] to show us his mind
[1:24:43] that was from the beginning
[1:24:45] to the ending
[1:24:48] the beginning to the ending
[1:24:50] don't worry about it we ain't run out of
[1:24:52] a lot
[1:24:53] but run them on Christ the Mr God
[1:24:54] revealed he said let's go back into the
[1:24:57] back part
[1:24:59] of God's mind so we ain't run out of
[1:25:02] something to preach on
[1:25:03] we're just getting ready to preach
[1:25:07] but the mind
[1:25:11] let's get in his mind
[1:25:13] and see where we're at
[1:25:19] look at number nine
[1:25:23] this is questions and answers 1959 6 28
[1:25:26] evening
[1:25:30] but before the foundation the world our
[1:25:31] names
[1:25:33] when the lamb was slain our names were
[1:25:36] put on the book what book now
[1:25:40] when in God's own mind he foresaw us and
[1:25:44] predestinated Us by his full knowledge
[1:25:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:49] oh brother if that wouldn't make the
[1:25:51] church get up and run through the aisles
[1:25:54] I'm not quite like the brother was at
[1:25:56] the fellowship meeting kept on pounding
[1:25:58] on us the other day it's all right
[1:25:59] that's his business his way he kept on
[1:26:01] trying to get us all to stand up when he
[1:26:02] got to that I could see to stand up the
[1:26:05] rest of us too old to stand up
[1:26:10] I said if I get a chance I won't talk to
[1:26:11] your boy
[1:26:12] they won't tell him hey when you're too
[1:26:14] old you don't stand
[1:26:16] you know
[1:26:18] I try to be comical without being
[1:26:20] hateful laughs
[1:26:22] but look what he says
[1:26:27] he said when in God's own mind
[1:26:33] he foresaw us
[1:26:36] and predestinated Us by his
[1:26:39] foreknowledge
[1:26:41] so now keep your thought what I'm saying
[1:26:44] mind of God
[1:26:48] is the foreknowledge of God that's where
[1:26:50] it exists that's why Judas could be in
[1:26:54] the mind of God
[1:26:56] yeah
[1:26:58] Cody's in the word of God
[1:27:01] but that don't make him eternal
[1:27:04] why because God saw he would never
[1:27:07] accept it
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:14] so the mind of God keep it is what for
[1:27:17] knowledge
[1:27:19] and does away with a lot of the
[1:27:20] doctrines of the message oh I was in his
[1:27:23] mind
[1:27:25] so was Judas
[1:27:27] and like I tell you a lot of people
[1:27:30] don't like me either but I just try to
[1:27:32] tell it like it is and forget it
[1:27:34] everybody says he saw me there
[1:27:38] that's right
[1:27:40] he was in hell and he was in heaven
[1:27:42] which were we at
[1:27:47] right
[1:27:48] he said he saw me there he might have
[1:27:50] seen you in hell
[1:27:53] yeah but that's it everybody likes to
[1:27:56] make the little things to get you
[1:27:57] catchphrases to get you involved with
[1:28:00] them I just don't have much catchphrases
[1:28:04] you know
[1:28:06] I just don't have enough sense to do
[1:28:09] that
[1:28:10] but listen
[1:28:13] said when in God's mind he foresaw us
[1:28:16] and predestinated Us by his
[1:28:19] foreknowledge before the foundation of
[1:28:22] the world
[1:28:25] all right his mind is his word
[1:28:28] he wrote it out
[1:28:30] Armand Neville's to remember the prophet
[1:28:33] your name is written in the book he said
[1:28:35] now an arm and that was not written in
[1:28:37] the Bible but said while armored Neville
[1:28:39] is on Earth
[1:28:41] is written in the Bible what would take
[1:28:42] place
[1:28:44] he said thereby that puts your name in
[1:28:46] the book
[1:28:48] why can't we believe it that way
[1:28:50] why can't we believe in the seal book
[1:28:52] where the Prophet said what
[1:28:54] he said the book is sealed
[1:28:57] I said you're sealed with a book
[1:29:01] you know he had to take a seal off bus
[1:29:03] in the last days
[1:29:05] the worst problem is
[1:29:07] the words he used as we brought out the
[1:29:09] other week
[1:29:12] the Holy Ghost has been bound Feast of
[1:29:14] the trumpets
[1:29:15] for 2000 years
[1:29:18] at the door of Creeds and dogmas
[1:29:20] so that means the Holy Ghost has never
[1:29:22] worked effectively
[1:29:24] it didn't in the book of Acts so we want
[1:29:27] to stay there for a while everybody
[1:29:28] brags on what they've done right they've
[1:29:30] done great things but they would also
[1:29:32] the Antichrist already come in
[1:29:38] but what I love about it he said he's to
[1:29:40] be in the Holy Ghost is to be loose wow
[1:29:42] by the end time message
[1:29:47] in other words you know what that means
[1:29:50] that means you and I have got to become
[1:29:53] the word
[1:29:56] right not just talk about it we've got
[1:29:59] to become the word
[1:30:03] well what's wrong then with bringing out
[1:30:06] and exposing things when running around
[1:30:08] and said if he'd be glad when they'd
[1:30:10] stand up like they did to Paul and say
[1:30:12] you're not saying what Paul said
[1:30:15] he said you'd be glad to see him when he
[1:30:17] comes to that
[1:30:19] I don't have any troubles anybody out
[1:30:21] there I've always made it you see me off
[1:30:23] the word come
[1:30:25] show me because I want to be right
[1:30:28] but don't bring me no fight little
[1:30:31] sugar tits
[1:30:33] save you time
[1:30:36] show me where I miss it in the word
[1:30:43] you know that's all I want because I
[1:30:44] want to be right
[1:30:50] my brother random goes into something
[1:30:53] and watch go ahead the number
[1:30:55] 10.
[1:30:57] excuse me let's go to number 11.
[1:31:02] questions and answers 59 628 paragraph
[1:31:05] 165.
[1:31:07] may go on to another paragraph he's
[1:31:09] talking about if we were saved before oh
[1:31:11] we don't want to stop here if we were
[1:31:13] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:31:14] were we he said yes
[1:31:16] yes sir Revelation 13 8.
[1:31:20] said that you were saved and your name
[1:31:22] was put in the lounge book of life
[1:31:24] before the foundation the world ever
[1:31:27] was ever created
[1:31:29] you see it's in Ephesians 1.
[1:31:33] so were we saved before the world well
[1:31:35] that means we come into World eternal
[1:31:37] life
[1:31:42] yeah you better back up a little
[1:31:46] because you're not saying what he's
[1:31:48] saying
[1:31:49] because it says blessed the
[1:31:52] father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:54] all right
[1:31:56] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:31:58] before the foundational world that we
[1:32:01] should be holding Without Blame
[1:32:05] if there's anything Eternal about us
[1:32:07] it's got to be in Christ
[1:32:14] then he goes on to having predestinated
[1:32:16] us unto adoption of children
[1:32:19] all right
[1:32:20] just keep rolling it because it'll go
[1:32:22] into the next one
[1:32:26] paragraph 167
[1:32:29] the same message
[1:32:31] questions and answers in 59
[1:32:34] were we Spirits then
[1:32:37] he's explaining about how we were for
[1:32:39] the world we're with Spirits then
[1:32:43] he said no
[1:32:46] we were not even nothing then
[1:32:53] but in God's mind we were
[1:32:59] and he spoke it
[1:33:03] and it materialized
[1:33:05] Jesus was slain and he knows that the
[1:33:07] Bible teaches that Jesus was the last
[1:33:09] name before the foundation were my God
[1:33:11] spoke it and when he spoke it it was as
[1:33:14] good as finished
[1:33:16] amen and when he saw me he saw you
[1:33:19] before the foundation world we were only
[1:33:21] figurative in his mind
[1:33:25] so we were any were we anything back
[1:33:27] there
[1:33:29] you better remember
[1:33:32] people wants to keep going back into
[1:33:34] God's mind
[1:33:37] well you better remember that if you
[1:33:40] step too far back from his mind
[1:33:44] that you could
[1:33:47] predestinate yourself out of existence
[1:33:52] you know what
[1:33:54] because when you go back to him being
[1:33:57] Elohim self-existing
[1:34:04] now that was not
[1:34:08] the word god
[1:34:12] it was Elohim it's self-existing the
[1:34:15] word god
[1:34:17] means an object of worship
[1:34:20] you got to have something to worship him
[1:34:22] before he could be God
[1:34:24] so there was a time that there was
[1:34:26] nothing to worship him oh he was up in
[1:34:28] heaven just running all over the place
[1:34:31] bring it over to his mind and
[1:34:33] foreknowledge and you're right
[1:34:34] back up a little bit where are you at
[1:34:40] you just take yourself clean out of
[1:34:42] existence
[1:34:43] because if you go back to self-existing
[1:34:49] which I don't believe God will ever do
[1:34:50] that again
[1:34:52] he was at in the beginning and when he
[1:34:53] created us he'll never go back to being
[1:34:55] Seth existing
[1:34:58] um
[1:34:59] that's why they tried to use the word
[1:35:00] Jehovah
[1:35:02] because Jehovah which is the Lord God
[1:35:04] when he brought it over in Genesis
[1:35:06] Lord God simply means Jehovah Elohim
[1:35:10] that's what it means Lord God means
[1:35:12] Jehovah that means Elohim their
[1:35:14] self-existent has come down and created
[1:35:16] a family
[1:35:17] and no longer will he ever be
[1:35:19] self-existing
[1:35:20] I love him for that
[1:35:24] he made angels and they worshiped him in
[1:35:26] that call that's made him God
[1:35:28] we still wasn't there
[1:35:37] think about it
[1:35:41] look at number 12.
[1:35:43] the word became flesh and India trip
[1:35:46] 54 1003 the morning service
[1:35:53] and he went on the way and the next day
[1:35:55] coming back
[1:35:56] a tree had withered you know the
[1:35:57] background story
[1:35:59] God's mind
[1:36:01] the mind that in the beginning
[1:36:04] that was a thought before it was a word
[1:36:08] that expressed Jesus Christ the same one
[1:36:10] one was expressed that word back again
[1:36:13] the
[1:36:15] and every word in the Bible is God's
[1:36:18] thought
[1:36:18] laid in seed form
[1:36:26] it's the word of God
[1:36:28] 's talks laid in seed form
[1:36:32] that if received into the human being
[1:36:36] and spoke by the same thought
[1:36:39] that materialized the Bible
[1:36:42] brings the things to pious
[1:36:45] what made the Bible manifest
[1:36:48] God's thoughts
[1:36:51] now where are we at
[1:36:56] look at the next one number 13. get
[1:36:58] these couple real quick
[1:37:01] this is Page 338.
[1:37:04] it's comes down it's from 30 37 if
[1:37:07] you're looking in the book because it'll
[1:37:09] be divided but when they got it in the
[1:37:10] computer they brought it 338 just
[1:37:12] telling you that in case you look in
[1:37:13] there say this ain't in the
[1:37:15] Church age book you know go over a
[1:37:17] little bit more and you'll find it
[1:37:19] this verse is not given to an individual
[1:37:23] it is given to the church he is talking
[1:37:26] to the church furthermore if you will
[1:37:28] just keep the word in mind
[1:37:30] you will recall that no word does it say
[1:37:34] we are in the mouth of God
[1:37:37] it may not mean a thing to you but it
[1:37:39] means a great thing to me
[1:37:42] because he said I'll spew you out of my
[1:37:44] mouth
[1:37:45] but the bride was never said talked
[1:37:48] about and been in the mind
[1:37:49] we are engraved in his palms
[1:37:54] we are carried in his bosom
[1:37:58] way back in the unknown ages before time
[1:38:01] we were in his mind
[1:38:04] we are in his Sheepfold
[1:38:07] in his posture
[1:38:10] but never in his mouth
[1:38:15] but what is it in the mouth of the Lord
[1:38:18] why but what is in the mouth of the Lord
[1:38:22] the word is in his mouth
[1:38:25] but we're never talked about as being in
[1:38:27] his mouth
[1:38:29] everywhere else but not in his mouth
[1:38:32] because he Spears out
[1:38:35] it's like I've always said to you know
[1:38:37] I'll give you this before we get back
[1:38:38] and most of you know the statement
[1:38:41] you talk about being in the mind of God
[1:38:45] I don't want to be now listen very
[1:38:48] carefully I'll read the next when we're
[1:38:50] thoughts and all like that
[1:38:52] I don't want to be a thought in God's
[1:38:53] mind because that could be a Judas is
[1:38:55] character
[1:38:58] if there's anything I want to be is I
[1:39:00] want to be part of the Thinker
[1:39:03] okay
[1:39:06] I want to be part of the Thinker
[1:39:10] that way I can get an eternal part to me
[1:39:14] you can see we are father got to go back
[1:39:16] a little bit aren't we
[1:39:18] just because we were in his mind doesn't
[1:39:21] make us eternal
[1:39:26] that we can be a part of the Mind
[1:39:29] that's why Paul didn't say I think I
[1:39:31] have
[1:39:32] he said I have the mind of Christ
[1:39:40] he said he had to bind to Christ
[1:39:43] the mind of Christ was in Paul
[1:39:47] let this mind
[1:39:49] me and you
[1:39:51] that was in Christ Jesus
[1:39:54] it'll make you a new creature
[1:39:56] right
[1:39:59] so I don't want to be just in his mind
[1:40:01] as a thought
[1:40:04] go back just a little bit further
[1:40:06] I want to go back another step from
[1:40:08] foreknowledge
[1:40:12] look at your life when we'll quit
[1:40:15] paragraph
[1:40:18] 149 Church age book
[1:40:23] the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:40:25] you are the thoughts of God eternal
[1:40:29] if you see this you'll see many things
[1:40:32] what God is unchangeable in both absence
[1:40:35] and behavior
[1:40:38] now think of that
[1:40:42] and then you'll see why it could be
[1:40:46] the Eternal God could think
[1:40:51] of you being lost
[1:40:56] because he knew what you would do when
[1:40:58] you got here
[1:41:00] and he can never think of another
[1:41:02] thought about you
[1:41:08] right right
[1:41:09] so if he thought of you being lost it
[1:41:12] means you come to the world and never
[1:41:14] accepted him
[1:41:16] problems down here not up there
[1:41:22] but the thought can never be changed
[1:41:26] Jacob
[1:41:27] he saw have I hated that's in God's word
[1:41:31] come from his mind for knowledge because
[1:41:33] of what they would do and he thought of
[1:41:35] Jacob and Esau
[1:41:38] would never be changed
[1:41:44] the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:41:50] he said well that's that borderline and
[1:41:53] on predetermining ain't it no you didn't
[1:41:56] listen
[1:42:00] but it's foreknowledge he could
[1:42:02] predetermine it
[1:42:04] and by that means you are going to be
[1:42:06] that
[1:42:07] because he saw you do it
[1:42:14] there's no way to plead the case when we
[1:42:15] get there
[1:42:19] right
[1:42:21] is it not even in the Bible it
[1:42:24] we see him
[1:42:25] preachers right
[1:42:27] comes up before him and says have not I
[1:42:29] cast out devils in thy name done Mighty
[1:42:32] wonderful Works what'd he say
[1:42:35] depart for me
[1:42:38] I never knew you
[1:42:42] didn't say he never knew of him
[1:42:45] huh
[1:42:48] but he knew in his foreknowledge and in
[1:42:50] his predestination that that preacher
[1:42:52] would never come to
[1:42:56] having a
[1:42:58] born-again experience
[1:43:00] a relationship with Christ
[1:43:03] we never knew him
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:10] the thoughts of God to enter eternally
[1:43:12] can't be changed
[1:43:15] once you stand here in his mind
[1:43:17] could you rewrite the Bible and save
[1:43:20] Judas
[1:43:22] uh is not that what they're trying to do
[1:43:27] is it not movies made of Judas now
[1:43:31] come on I don't go to movies but I do
[1:43:35] hear and read
[1:43:36] they've made a movie that Judas wouldn't
[1:43:39] such a bad guy
[1:43:40] he was really trying to help Jesus
[1:43:47] so you can write anything you want to
[1:43:48] and then people go to the movie and
[1:43:50] they'll say it's in the Bible
[1:43:52] I saw it
[1:43:55] you know says be the meals done at that
[1:43:58] you know
[1:44:02] people swear by right
[1:44:04] Edward tub will set on its own bottom
[1:44:07] that didn't work
[1:44:11] but people swear about my Grandmama read
[1:44:14] it
[1:44:16] she told me she did
[1:44:18] are you calling my grandma no you are
[1:44:25] and like the way brother would be said
[1:44:27] anything he said I Love My Mama but said
[1:44:29] if my mom was a liar said she's a liar
[1:44:30] like any mom was a liar
[1:44:33] that's where he used to say it years ago
[1:44:35] but the thoughts of God
[1:44:39] he's unchangeable in that behavior we
[1:44:42] studied that and proven that already God
[1:44:44] is infinite in his abilities so
[1:44:46] therefore he as God must be omniscient
[1:44:49] he is omniscient
[1:44:50] then he is not now learning nor is he
[1:44:53] taking counsel even with himself
[1:44:56] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:44:59] knowledge
[1:45:00] if you can add to his knowledge then he
[1:45:03] is not omniscient the best you could say
[1:45:05] is that sometimes he will be
[1:45:08] but that's not the scriptural that's not
[1:45:10] scriptural
[1:45:12] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:45:14] thought about anything because of all of
[1:45:17] his thoughts
[1:45:18] he has always had and always will have
[1:45:21] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:45:23] because he's God
[1:45:26] thus the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:45:30] they're real
[1:45:33] they're not simply like a man with a
[1:45:35] blueprint is drawn up in which one day
[1:45:38] will be translated into substance and
[1:45:41] form
[1:45:42] but they are already real and eternal
[1:45:45] and part of God
[1:45:48] can't add to it can't change it
[1:45:51] we don't come to Earth
[1:45:53] and change God's mind
[1:45:57] that doesn't work
[1:46:00] we are living his mind
[1:46:10] even my brother's Methodist preacher he
[1:46:12] says well at least there's a few things
[1:46:13] in the Bible
[1:46:14] he said I guess what's predestinated
[1:46:17] but said I don't believe the rest of it
[1:46:18] was
[1:46:19] you know
[1:46:21] I said well
[1:46:24] it wasn't predestinated like you think
[1:46:28] 12 14 years College
[1:46:31] but you see he says
[1:46:34] I don't even believe that Jesus was
[1:46:36] virgin born I said so you're out of the
[1:46:38] word of God forget it
[1:46:41] he said while we had a neighbor down
[1:46:43] there one time that had a baby and said
[1:46:44] she never know the man I said yet she
[1:46:46] lied
[1:46:50] she's alive
[1:46:55] but listen Church
[1:46:58] do you understand what foreknowledge
[1:47:01] that God he predestined he's
[1:47:03] predetermining was over on this side his
[1:47:06] foreknowledge was back here looking out
[1:47:08] then he could predetermine are
[1:47:11] write it in this book and it would be
[1:47:14] that way and that's not him choosing
[1:47:17] because he knows our choosing
[1:47:19] amen
[1:47:20] now we back up to the mind
[1:47:23] in the thought
[1:47:25] that in his mind was a foreknowledge
[1:47:29] that he could say that Jesus Christ
[1:47:31] stood as a lamp slain before the
[1:47:32] foundation of the world
[1:47:35] ever named ever be written in the Book
[1:47:37] of Life land Book of Life
[1:47:41] the sister brought this up at lunch so
[1:47:43] let's cover it just a second
[1:47:45] then in the Book of Daniel that's books
[1:47:50] The Book of Revelation it talks about
[1:47:51] books plural
[1:47:53] all right
[1:47:55] so there's a book of
[1:47:57] our Natural Life
[1:48:01] there is a book of life
[1:48:06] and there's a lounge Book of Life
[1:48:08] The Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of
[1:48:10] Life is one book
[1:48:12] the two sections I'm in the prophet's
[1:48:14] message bring it right
[1:48:16] two sections one book
[1:48:19] Judas is carrot's name was in The Book
[1:48:21] of Life
[1:48:23] but it was removed
[1:48:30] if you don't see predestination my full
[1:48:32] knowledge from that ain't something
[1:48:33] wrong with you
[1:48:35] to see that God made in his book Little
[1:48:38] Brian said and then he mentioned a group
[1:48:40] of people that their names he said are
[1:48:42] not written over
[1:48:44] then he goes on he says
[1:48:47] but I'm not saying that they wouldn't
[1:48:48] have
[1:48:49] record made
[1:48:51] you know
[1:48:53] this Bible is a record
[1:48:55] you think Judas can plead his case
[1:49:01] I got his own sign stamped
[1:49:04] certificate
[1:49:06] he can't plead his case
[1:49:08] why
[1:49:10] because this tells me what he's doing
[1:49:11] what he done
[1:49:14] but you see there's a books
[1:49:16] there's a book of your natural life
[1:49:20] where you're living doing what we're
[1:49:22] doing and then we must be saved to
[1:49:25] become in The Book of Life
[1:49:28] section
[1:49:30] the prophet said you've got to become
[1:49:31] Church age book a part of a religious
[1:49:34] order
[1:49:35] centered around the worship of God for
[1:49:37] the day
[1:49:39] he said go by thereby Judas his name was
[1:49:42] written in the Book of Life
[1:49:44] but the lounge Book of Life was written
[1:49:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:49:49] as to all of those
[1:49:52] that would want salvation and receive it
[1:49:55] so nobody can complain or gripe
[1:49:58] the case is closed
[1:50:04] you and I are living the foreknowledge
[1:50:07] of God Amen let's stand we're living the
[1:50:10] mind of God
[1:50:12] why can't you take it like that and be
[1:50:14] wonderful to think about
[1:50:16] I think that that when I first heard
[1:50:19] that Prophet one day and he was talking
[1:50:21] he said even as bad as Israel was he
[1:50:24] said God never stayed up in heaven
[1:50:26] said he come down to busy himself with
[1:50:30] the people
[1:50:32] always they're making sacrifice you know
[1:50:35] Francis
[1:50:38] and those people say well my God's not
[1:50:40] real like you think
[1:50:42] well whatever you want to think about
[1:50:43] God
[1:50:45] he tore skins off of an animals and made
[1:50:48] Adam and Eve some clothes
[1:50:51] now that's according to the Bible
[1:50:55] so he must be pretty real
[1:50:57] he's just a spirit
[1:51:02] must be pretty real
[1:51:05] it wasn't Adam making their offering
[1:51:08] you have no record in the Bible where
[1:51:10] Adam ever made an offering
[1:51:14] come on
[1:51:16] Cain and Abel's when it started off the
[1:51:18] offers
[1:51:20] God made offering for Adam and Eve
[1:51:25] pull the skins off of them animals
[1:51:30] he said but that makes God a murderer
[1:51:35] what is all this today about the animal
[1:51:37] rights
[1:51:38] they'd be after him wouldn't he
[1:51:42] would he might have sacrifice
[1:51:45] to keep from killing
[1:51:47] because he had to where we got Brothers
[1:51:51] page 299 let's sing

[1:54:29] you can touch you
[1:54:31] sister come up this morning to be prayed
[1:54:34] for about renting a house and some
[1:54:36] people had rented the house
[1:54:37] got an email at lunch that they wasn't
[1:54:39] going to rent it you think that's going
[1:54:42] to bother me about believing
