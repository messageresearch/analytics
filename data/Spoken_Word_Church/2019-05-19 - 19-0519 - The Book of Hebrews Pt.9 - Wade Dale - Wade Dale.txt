TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] okay all right not everybody remembered the you remember the riddle y starts out on four legs and in the middle of this life but has two legs and then the end of his life has three legs Oh a man a human human starts out crawling on four and snow for the feet and the legs are crawling they stand on two feet here in the end of them during their life and at the end of the limb now walking and up that's all right I didn't mean how it would Bob is gonna be with y'all next Sunday doing this mmm brother Dale's leaving Saturday we're going to Illinois for about five we'll be back maybe not for a little I think releases preaching next Sunday morning and errands Sunday afternoon and then somebody's going means that are you into from that yeah you got some Billy coming up Ernie okay alright last Sunday we were talking about Melchizedek you know picked up a problem with their boom so we're on that balcony now many people feel in st. now not in not in them in the message that we will clear run around was clear about this person who melt as me kiss them there are some denominations that think it's just a priesthood but remember we look at this and we see that it was a man so they had no beginning yeah knowing any I know father mother my heavens it couldn't be a human mortal and it have to be Almighty God now what happened was though is we we have to see we have to see cuz remember now remember this is this is this is where we have to think like Paul and Peter name there was no concept of a Trinity in their life there's no concept of a Trinity for Paul and Peter and all them so they're not even talking even when Paul says the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ bless you all he know there's one daughter he's just giving you all the offices in all the positions same thing with Melchizedek could you see milk as neat now remember to I want to get into this maybe after I come back but Melchizedek make men Abraham flies he met Abram then he met Abraham read your Bible and Hebrew went and got a lot brought him back and then no cousin it came and giving communion under Abram which is made religious type of us in our journey then all right Abram it's our time before we get the Holy Ghost were able we're not in ham we're not problem son yet we're promise he's given us a promise that we're working towards so in Abraham's journey in justification and sanctification to Genesis 12 and all through there that is his journey through justification sanctification our journey through justification sanitation is Abram not Abraham our name doesn't change until we get the new birth all right then our main changes to Abraham are the Christian but you're not Christian before then for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who made for him returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him now I want you to see something to be proper and to be correct Paul should have said Abram cookie man Abram he didn't meet Abraham but now we look on this side of town dream okay because remember Paul never concludes that Abraham had any fault at all looking through the blood on this side in the New Testament in the Old Testament and the Old Testament look Abram first thing they from did was wrong first thing I ever did was wrong when he did God said Abram get up and follow me you and you alone what's the first thing you did eat to live always family don't get money which I feel cast top of us we get stable what everybody say we'll take a right but you know what sometimes that's not that's not my god say saliendo wander that's there for a little little time but remember he also gave his wife away as Abram and as Abraham okay mm-hmm he also when God told him he was gonna have the promised son instead of laughing in his heart he got down on the ground and laughed physically laughed in front of Godwin l remember brother Brown said if it wasn't for Abraham when Sarah laughed in her heart daughter would kill they killed Sarah for just giggling in their heart but Abraham gets on the ground just laughs it's not me okay so that's that's our journey that we have many faults and failures but once that promise son comes you watch Abraham he's right on point everything's right on point even when God tells him to take that promise son and take him upon a mountain in sacrificing he goes and don't hesitate he takes them right up there all right Abram I don't think would have done that they Braun was not in a position and that's what we want to talk about even in the seventh field we must be in a position to receive things from God okay being babies you can't receive a lot maybe just don't know what you're saying you look at me say don't do that don't do that well they just yeah that's right think back what just like babies hit the message to hurt the feeling they get the bit of dirt all right but as you grow older you know say well gonna do that when you know why you shouldn't do these things you know you shouldn't go walk out you know take a little baby those crawl out the mill that road with no fear wife though they don't know but as they get older they know what's going on that's thing with you or not that's being mature Christians that brother Brian tells us will not read it this weekend but as brother Graham tells us we have to come into speaking condition where they what we say is what God says and there's no in-between so remember that what the day that Jesus got up and said sure I did this for sure no he just lived his life he was God Almighty and human flesh he was led by the Spirit of God that's right right you didn't doubt he was God he didn't get up one morning to go I don't feel like well no he probably did good he probably got up some mornings and didn't feel like a human but he got up and went I don't know but now remember this person Melchizedek was a man and he was a king of Salem priest all these different things a physician in the Old Testament because remember brother rocks if we don't see Melchizedek any more we see Jesus Christ oh so in Paul is talking about Melchizedek but not Melchizedek being present at all Melchizedek Priesthood to us is done away with we don't we're not under Melchizedek Priesthood we're under the priesthood of Almighty God not not just a man here that puts on a skin a flashing tops to Abram and then steps out of it that flesh but that it thanks Craig that is cut so what part of that did I not was there not clear we're not going to we're not enter Melchizedek Priesthood yeah what I'm saying is is we will not there will not be a God in human flesh meet us on this earth to stay this way okay and if I got that we have a we have a priesthood that is a fivefold ministry priesthood that God uses our flesh to get to your flesh not flash but you know filter through memories and conscience and all that because remember we meet Melchizedek Jesus Christ God Almighty we meet him anyhow so so there's no redemption in the end all the redemption is down here everything to be redeemed for us now I'm talking about the bride not the whole world this member woman went to the sixth seal they got to be a purging of the 144,000 the Buddhist virgin never can remember foods fruits burger and and the world so that has to go to a purging and that has to go through a developing of even a thousand years this thing's going to be going on but see you and I when we come to that here when Jesus walked out and said all the time I have never been given unto me it was done it was done he didn't there was nothing else to be fulfilled as far as part of his earthly journey of Jesus being on earth he was done twice Emily instead of Calgary into Spanish well then it was finished for that part but he went to the souls and president he went and picked up Abraham on them took him up into glory come back on and tell Pentecost and he's been working ever since but it as far as his earthly journey it was finishing partially human journey because when he'd come out of that tent to him he was not human he was inhuman he was immortal he wasn't just mortally with him or his flesh had been changed to be turnable will read that quote again today which I really love oh absolutely no I need it [Applause] [Music] that's correct well I mean many times you look and see Melchizedek has an older person and he was and he was a young man because when he stepped into that flesh he just molded around the theophany that he was and that was the same theophany you know even brother Brown why would he use the analogy when Jesus went to hell on the priest of the soul in prison he was NSD off that he wasn't in flesh is flesh still an antenna yeah when he opened the door to paradise we know it's a story but but I believe brother round saw it I believe it was true when Abraham said oh well said that's the guy we spend cavitation well it was Jesus standing there say man thank God all right so we see them to that they recognized him and that's what you and I during our journey we've got a meat milk isn't he just like hey I met Mel Kennedy but we don't meet melcat we don't mean Jesus Christ in human flesh we mean Jesus Christ in human flesh right here see that's the great mystery there's no mystery to a man walking up and saying how Melchizedek and I'm the eternal God there's no mystery to that but when we can say that we are that same person are part of that same person made manifest in another form called arrive it looked all different colors and flavors thing and all that nobody can see that they saw who do you think you are well I'm just telling you what the Bible thing I just really feel that's what the message of the hour was here to do was for brother Branham his sole message of course was to opening of the seals which revealed Christ and I'll read that this afternoon he was reveal Christ when I worst Christ revealed that in you and me he's not revealed in paper letters he's not even revealed in 1,100 servings brother Graham Creek if you can read him all the Daisy life and die and go to hell but when that comes off of the page and comes inside of you you forget to rest okay but reading them you have to read you have to read them we're not going away with about I'm just telling you these people read this message for 30 40 years from now they're out of the world they never got the essence of what was going on there that never became alive in their heart all right that's why you can take the quote and you can make it's a hundred thousand different things same this listened the same scriptures were reading today the Catholics reading them the Presbyterians reading them the Pentecostal to read them the Trinitarian to reading them and their sin all the Trinity's all the way through the Bible and we've got a Father Son and Holy Ghost medication it was just a priesthood Jim thing but we had the tree ice name like this the other day but that we get to listen on nice thing about this other day you know you take them you take a beautiful skyscraper and this thing's got like 150 floors two or 200 floors now what's the prettiest part of the skyscraper just a view from the top these things look pretty out here a man when you get up on top and you look out and you can see forever well how'd you get up there no no stairs that you might want to try it but go ahead no I want to get into a nice elevator and have it take me all the way up the top and there has to be in like in Atlanta when you go to the Marriott places or when I stayed over in the Philippines and then in a five-star hotel there's a guy standing there our girl and they say with for now when you get up there certain floor you can't go any further yes she has to put the key in or he has to put code in to get you in a been out so you can't really see what's going on that's what I'm saying about this the Word of God has always been there's always been the building this message is what takes us up through the statute perfect man in that elevator but there was a man standing there running around him there was a man a prophet stand-in there they when we got to the certain level we couldn't go no further he said I got the key clicker I've got the code and the code took us all the way up to the top so what you see what's going on see the landscape of God the landscape of God's what I want to see it's a little analogy they're tweeting you know you can try to walk up 250 floors and if you calculate that tell me how many steps that isn't it's astronomical but you and I don't have that time they may have done it Luther Wesley's day so they were way down here but you get what we're going winning an elevator we need some fingers to the top and that's what this message is it's taking us to the top sphere to right up to here to the stack your perfect man but you got to look at 18 times turning do them all so a man get a tenth part of all of them my affair first being my interpretation king of righteousness and after that king will fail them which is the king of peace but we obviously know that is and then without father without mother without this sent no words he had no descendants right his descendants are sitting here now because your descendants don't come before you think descend actively okay so that's what happened on the day of Pentecost he we became his descendants on the day of Pentecost his sons and daughters he had no sons and daughters while he was on earth zero right without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like them to the Son of God the bodies of priests continuing now consider how great this man was when did he leave of the patron help gave spoiled and barely paying that are the sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham they may understand that Levi the Levitical priesthood remember it was Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph come out from Jacob with what the tribes or the children of Israel Levi Reuben it's a car and Natali and all the ones ever I got that but God chose a little bit the Levi why did you believe I've you know why I'm in the Old Testament there was some commotion going on and leave up Levitical or Levi's single-most just turned to him and said hey you know what you can do about it so we'll just go kill them the latest we kill them all that's what's happened today we come up to church today we're going to come to a killing that's right we're gonna get all these things killed that looks right well God can only fill those who are not full of left okay so that was that started a Levitical priesthood but now remember the the true Levitical priesthood had to am because it was a person it was people descending generations Jesus had no descending generation right that's why I like that scripture who shall declare his generation there's a there's a group of people they see declaring the generation of God that's us right and they will command you to take tithes of the people according to law that is of their brethren though they come out on the one to bait them him they he like I say some about everybody understand about we're talking about Thailand just for a second because what happened I was reading this the other day there's up there certain other times that was given but the Levites the Levites gave time that's what a lot of Ministers don't think they should pay ties with life just a bunch of baloney do you think everybody plays tired they weren't they weren't set aside you know they were set aside in the whole of Israel they would be 10 she'd go through and 9 would make it in one way well out of a pretend there was one went into the pen for the Levi and that sustained them or paid their living but then the Levi's pay a 10% time back into the back end to run everything all right so that's the same way with you and I and brother Dale brother Dale gets the salary from the church he turned around Rostow chick puts it back in the church you know what it does it pays the salaries of people that come in and preach that's how he pays his ties to you he's done that forever and that should be the way he do it I don't think you should know no one is exempt from Fayette I know one zero I don't care who you are brother Branham paid time at $1,100 to goddamn teeth $10 won in them when they often play all right so sons of Levi we know that's over with the he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises all right give me and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better so 10% is blessed listen God can take 10% live off of 10% and we can't live off a name we have a struggle living off of 90 if you if you if you don't watch what you doing right and here men that die receive tithes but there he was Siva them with whom that his witness that he liveth as I may say so Levi also to receiving time paid Todd you can think I got that out of just the air Deacon Levi's paid time because where was it is said that in Levi's paid tithes while he was still in the background well that was his great-great-grandfather yeah okay frame was yet in the loins of his father moon milk as a big medic or the father all right so look if they're for perfection were by the Levitical priesthood there was no perfect perfection on a little bit of the priesthood all the Devils made sacrifices that covered the sin of Israel and kept pushing it like the Prophet said pushing into Calvary pushing it away all right for an under it that people receive the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be caught after the order of Aaron all right look for the priesthood it being changed nobody's done that so much about hesitates how am i coming from another priesthood all right for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law now look that doesn't mean they rewrote the law that law is written for every the law of the law King James Ten Commandments they've not become intensive guests they're okay for he of whom these things were spoken for ten to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the offer now watch cuz look Jesus never came from that probably by you would think being in the priesthood line of Levi that Jesus would be the great high priests he is there's no mother then he would come from Levi but he's not he came from the tribe of Judah right because she was the lawgiver what forgiving these things are spoken to panic to another tribe they strung from my Jesus name come out the Lord coming out of Judah of which no man gave attendance at the altar in other words Judah wasn't allowed in the temple but for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning freeze he hit that thing so well God did and it is yet far more evident from that after the civil to or the whiteness I think this one that says work likeness Oh milk as Isaiah Rises another priests priests priests priests who has made not after the law of the carnal commandment war what is carnal that's man fleshly commandment excuse me because most of all your Ten Commandments are fleshly don't kill don't back off with what we love your mother and father you know I'm the LORD thy God I want now that one maybe but most of it comes from fleshly things because remember back the Old Testament that's all they had that's all they had was the priests could walk up and they can have a thought about a woman not commit adultery with not touch her and they will find gone the politician don't play with the person but when Jesus comes and he said now if you just think about it that's why I said that this this flesh doesn't sin this is not the same part it was born in sin but this not the same part if some of the Jesus would say well that's right you just don't touch that girl and you're fine no he said you think in your heart you've already done it whether so it's got to go down into the memory reason conscience affection imagination of the person nothing not reflection we may not have long carnal commandment but after the power the endless life remember because remember he knows there was no strength in the law it was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ but there was no strength in the law is why it did hurt you it didn't make sense in nerves regarding just made you the neighbor a good person right but God allowed that until Christ came for he testified thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek for there's barely a decent knowing of the commandment that we're distant humming that would be setting aside going before for the weakness and unprofitable nests there up right after the lost weak and unprofitable right the converse nineteen for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did well is it Jesus Christ by the which we drove nine to God in other words with the law there was no way to get the gun there was one priest you put everything on him he went in he had to be perfect in his outfit and all of his ways he may have sacrificed the people outside and there were new anything what went on inside there but now you and I watch and in as much as not without an oath he was made priests now he'd interplay for those priests were made without a know but this with enough by him that said unto Him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after after the order of melchizedek by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better what Testament I like that word surety guarantee Ave what better covenant because remember ever happen that one priest was when he went and again give the that Tolman these people I had were just doing whatever I want to do right I mean they were just God wasn't looking at them he was going to sacrifice but now Christ came in he now wants to get into people that's what he always wanted to do he's always wanted to live in people not with people don't believe in them then when gleaming you know he can live with them right so a better testament would be that he would come to earth because that's what the whole summation is going to be and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continued ever had an unchangeable priesthood right wherefore he is able also to save them law can save anybody to the uttermost that came unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them what Jesus Christ our high priest for such an high priest became us hmm or was fitting for us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needed not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins of remember but not a priest one in he may sacrifice would you say then he made a sacrifice to the people cuz he had to do here to get his self by the way first and then for the people right and that's what Christ did he came down here took on flesh to die for me and he'll need to be up high free who needed not daily as these high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people for this he did once when he went to Calvary in other words when he offered up himself because remember the high priest didn't offer up himself the offer the high priest from taking blood of something right so there was no consequence except one thing that people stress right if he walked right get all the pomegranates and not if he did everything right I couldn't kill him there's already something cute there was a lamb had been killed but this guy offered up himself right where the law maketh man high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was sense though all maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore in other words he will evermore be he'll always be a high priest look now the things which we have spoken this is the son I love Paul all that that we had right there he gets to a main point verse that chapter 7 now these things we have spoken this is the son we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven no where's the mediator right see Melchizedek when he met Abraham was not a mediator he was a messenger he wasn't the mediator he was the messenger he didn't come and say Abraham now I'm gonna go die and then he know he just give him a message Abraham about time alive you'll change your body doesn't work that's what he was saying and Sarah gonna change go back you'll have a baby alright Nene laughs but now this person no he's right there anything he gave his life for us a minister of the sanctuary of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched in that land who'd he talked about himself his body where every high priest his ordained offering gifts and sacrifices where for his of a necessity that this man have someone also the huffin what do you offer don't pretty self right for him he were on earth he should not be a priest seemed that there a priest that offer you according to the law who stirred through the example and shadow of heavenly things whatever happened down here is what Moses went I remember when brother Brown said Moses went to heaven and got the vision of the tabernacle and all that it was really Jesus Christ but when he came to earth he built the best he could do was run out of court enter court holy of Holy's he builted everything down he recording so that was a shadow of what was in heaven because remember all that sweetness you know that that temple there there will never be a temple that God goes to many more ship you and made that temple have been done away with the physical temple even when they get it finished in Israel this time do any good got time left it needs the left the temple as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for seed stands he that now make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mouth in other words when he went to the mountain he got the pattern to make them out of court in court holy holy spark and all those things but now has he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises because remember the promises was made in the Old Testament were promises of if you make this sacrifice I'll forgive you and next year you're gonna have to do the same thing and if you have another problem you're gonna have to make another sacrifice and you're gonna have to do this I was reading yesterday morning where Solomon when he finished the temple if I'm not mistaken there was like a hundred thousand sacrifices beyond number the Bible said that was made for all these different things that they had to make it for hundred thousand animals that was a mess but now see all I start away with there was one man John on the cross and and now they we're at that first covenant had been faultless they should no place in this offer the second other words if everything in the Old Testament was fine why don't we need Jesus to come down and dive in human body well he wasn't perfect it was they had Paul for finding fault with them he said behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of his room with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not for touch for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their line and write them in their heart not on the tablet and I will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for all show know me from the least to the greatest now once he said I'm not just going to come down and get in and talk in one man to a group and they just believe that man no I'm going to go in each individual person right for all shall know me from the least of the grades probably merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more and that he say of a new covenant he has made the first old that's why they call it the Old Testament and they call it the New Testament now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away in other words hey you can't you can't find Solomon I was reading there in where wasn't King Solomon built his temple took him years to build this place beautiful gold everywhere ivory and all these things find it now there's one little porch sitting over there now they call it follow its porch and bunch of rotten steps that go up to nothing there's nothing there a new covenant he has made the first covenant old now that which decays the Wackness old is ready consensually continue reading then barely the first covenant had also offices of divine service and a worldly sanctuary a worldly sanctuary well there was a tabernacle made the first were in was the candlestick in the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary now will register I mean we're going to stop the book there and after the second Bale the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all remember there's only there's only two males there was no veil in the outer court the outer court it was just a court you walked into a court the first veil was the inner court right now the court had no veil in a court and a veil with the candlesticks and only certain people what I'm saying is certain only certain people get to the segment only one could go to the to the next one which was the state of bail right the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all in other words we've had the sensors and all these we read that two Sundays from now look at the bottom they got double duty this weekend refresh this weekend's are all of our criminally really good we're going to do a service more Kentucky not brother bar will go to a different Church for him oh no he never called me back Jojo hear that no one has called me back from the whole turn
