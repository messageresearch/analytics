[2:23] that they're saying is wrong with it
[2:25] that's what they're doing medically but
[2:27] we believe in the Healer the deliverer
[2:30] of the Savior the all in all and Jesus
[2:32] is his name amen just remember that

[2:50] hour that we have we thank you for your
[2:52] love and your grace unto us thank you
[2:54] for Calvary because that was where all
[2:57] things were made possible we pray that
[3:00] you would just bless and guide each one
[3:01] of us now as we talk about you as we
[3:04] read your word and meditate upon the
[3:07] thoughts Lord that you've given unto us
[3:09] that we can deliver our hearts to the
[3:11] people and we ask you to forgive our
[3:13] sins guide us by your grace and love and
[3:16] keep us bless each one remember the
[3:19] little baby is our Lord and just reach
[3:20] down and touch it and they they have to
[3:22] come back and say all of their tests
[3:24] were wrong because we believe you father
[3:26] and we we keep on praying and believing
[3:29] remember the sick among us because
[3:31] there's many here but you said you sent
[3:33] your word and healed us so as we lord
[3:37] speak about you you come on the scene to
[3:39] manifest yourself because that's the
[3:41] desire you've always wanted to be
[3:44] we love you and we thank you to have
[3:46] your way now and keep us in Jesus name
[3:49] amen
[3:52] Romans 8.
[3:55] 28-31
[3:58] and we know that all things work
[4:00] together for good to them that love God
[4:02] to them who are the called according to
[4:05] his purpose
[4:06] and whom he did for no he also did
[4:09] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:11] image of his son that he might be the
[4:13] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[4:16] of whom he did predestinate then he also
[4:19] called and whom he called then he also
[4:21] justified in whom he justified let me
[4:24] also glorified what shall we then say to
[4:28] these things if God be for us who can be
[4:32] against us amen you may be seated the
[4:34] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[4:36] the word
[4:38] now we've been
[4:41] studying for quite a while about
[4:43] how does God predestinate and we've been
[4:46] covering the the points and trying to
[4:48] get to it and uh you know moving on into
[4:52] our thoughts and all and I pray that
[4:54] that you will listen to what's being
[4:57] said and and you know pray about it and
[5:00] ask the Lord to reveal it because I
[5:02] believe we're in the last days I believe
[5:04] we're here at the fine the winding up of
[5:06] all things and I sure hope so because if
[5:10] not uh then I get to go by the grave
[5:14] because you know you get on up in age
[5:16] and you realize that hey I hope the Lord
[5:19] will hurry up and come quickly maybe
[5:21] maybe we need to see it that way at
[5:24] least because John when he got on Patmos
[5:26] he wasn't too old but when he got down
[5:28] to the end of it
[5:30] that's what he said he said even though
[5:32] come quickly Lord he's saying the end
[5:35] and seen that that was what it was and
[5:38] seen all of the things and he just said
[5:40] come quickly well that should be our
[5:43] thoughts and our minds but I said we've
[5:45] been talking about how does God
[5:47] predestinate
[5:50] he predestinates we read here in the
[5:52] scripture by his foreknowledge
[5:55] all right now for knowledge is knowledge
[5:58] before
[5:59] and I'll repeat this two or three times
[6:02] today the Lord willing
[6:04] but for knowledge is
[6:06] the fact of knowing something before it
[6:10] transfires
[6:11] all right but it means also that what is
[6:15] foreknown must one day
[6:18] transpire you know it must take place
[6:20] because he knew it he saw it all right
[6:24] so that's not cutting anything short
[6:26] everything that's in the word of God
[6:28] must be fulfilled
[6:31] you know and you know and he saw who
[6:34] would be saved and who wouldn't be saved
[6:37] by his foreknowledge in that way then he
[6:39] could predestinate you know he could set
[6:42] it or or say it because you remember how
[6:45] we've been doing it the prophet said
[6:47] what
[6:48] predestination looks back to
[6:50] foreknowledge
[6:52] all right then for knowledge looks to
[6:55] Destiny well that's simple isn't it
[6:58] that makes foreknowledge
[7:00] stronger or greater than predestination
[7:03] so we've all you know been in our lives
[7:06] studying of predestination and thinking
[7:08] that God just stamps this and he's going
[7:10] to save a certain amount of people and
[7:12] and and all of this that and the other
[7:14] and some people were just made into the
[7:16] world just to be lost and things well I
[7:19] don't believe it that way I I don't
[7:22] believe I believe by foreknowledge
[7:25] he knew who would be saved and who
[7:28] wouldn't so he could say Jacob have I
[7:30] loved and he saw how I hated even before
[7:32] they were ever born he said well he
[7:34] didn't give them a change
[7:35] no you're not listening
[7:38] foreknowledge means knowledge before
[7:44] did you understand that
[7:46] so then by knowledge before he knew what
[7:48] Jacob would do and what Esau would do
[7:52] so he didn't make them wrong
[7:56] he made them correct but he knew which
[7:59] way it would go
[8:01] by his foreknowledge all right then when
[8:04] they were born into the world
[8:07] they were just fulfilling his
[8:08] foreknowledge you say well it didn't
[8:10] give them a change no that's the thing
[8:13] that we we don't follow he all he gives
[8:15] everybody a change
[8:17] like
[8:19] even as I said our winds didn't have
[8:21] before that I really appreciate the
[8:23] prophets saying that even the people in
[8:27] in the Heathen in these countries that
[8:29] don't even hear the gospel but yet
[8:31] they'll be judged by their laws and
[8:34] tribes and things because there's no uh
[8:37] judgment can be made of them about
[8:39] Christianity
[8:41] well that's a wonderful God to me you
[8:44] know I I just don't leave anybody out
[8:47] was he then trying to get us to the
[8:49] foreknowledge part
[8:51] getting us to look back and quit trying
[8:53] to see if well if I was predetermined
[8:55] then I'll be there
[8:57] well that doesn't that's not even common
[9:00] sense
[9:01] unto us
[9:03] and that's why I love foreknowledge
[9:06] because foreknowledge then God looked
[9:09] down and seen that I would want to be
[9:11] saved
[9:15] but he looked down also and seen a lot
[9:17] of other people would not want to be
[9:18] saved well then he's just in his doings
[9:22] because he knew what our choice would be
[9:25] and we we sing that old song you know
[9:27] wait a little longer please Jesus do we
[9:29] get our families in or something well
[9:31] there's no such thing and they ain't
[9:33] even scriptural
[9:34] because if he's if he left us here
[9:37] another million years upon the Earth
[9:39] you know and you and I could live that
[9:42] million years without aging they'd never
[9:43] be another person saved that was not in
[9:46] the foreknowledge of God as to be saved
[9:50] see so then it's not Assumption of a
[9:52] haphazard thing that God is just doing
[9:54] this or that or the other and we're no
[9:56] but we are living out our predestination
[10:01] we are the ones who choose
[10:04] then when we look back we can see that
[10:07] he could go ahead and choose us
[10:10] because the Bible said we were chosen in
[10:12] him
[10:14] before the foundation of the world
[10:16] all right
[10:17] but remember many are chosen
[10:21] right
[10:22] right see many I mean many are called
[10:24] but a few are chosen all right so then
[10:27] we get it in the correct order to
[10:29] understand
[10:30] what life is about and what we're doing
[10:33] God never wished that anybody be lost
[10:36] he wouldn't everybody be saved
[10:39] amen but he knew who wouldn't who would
[10:41] not
[10:44] and see then that to me then is looking
[10:47] down and seeing us making our journey
[10:51] and seeing us choosing
[10:54] to be
[10:55] Christians
[10:58] when others will not choose to be that
[11:01] right and in that way we can see that he
[11:04] could put us then on a uh an equal basis
[11:11] now even with him
[11:13] you remember that Wednesday now we're
[11:15] not on equal bases trying to be a God
[11:17] right get that off your mind
[11:19] but when God gave us a choice
[11:23] that makes you unequal basis with God
[11:27] because if he overrides your choice he's
[11:30] up here you're down here
[11:32] right
[11:34] see but if he gives us a choice
[11:37] and making that choice equal it simply
[11:41] means that he's not going to override it
[11:45] he's not going to override your free
[11:47] moral agency he won't make you be saved
[11:49] I don't care what you've been taught
[11:52] you get in the word of God and let's
[11:54] talk about it
[11:55] we've been taught this that or the other
[11:57] you know things down through there but
[11:59] what does the Bible say
[12:02] those who we foreknew he did
[12:04] predestinate is that we just what we
[12:06] just got through Reading
[12:08] yes right then we take the Bible for it
[12:10] and and don't worry about the rest all
[12:12] right but now remember election looks
[12:15] back to foreknowledge
[12:19] for knowledge then looks on to the
[12:21] destiny of where you're going
[12:24] so it's all in God's foreknowledge
[12:28] then in his foreknowledge
[12:31] we've covered a lot of things that would
[12:33] be dealing with in his foreknowledge
[12:36] and then we can put it down to the basis
[12:38] of understanding where we're at
[12:41] and the day that we're living
[12:46] and knowing that
[12:48] as I said I'm going to repeat this
[12:50] because I want to keep it in your mind
[12:52] foreknowledge is knowledge
[12:55] of what will be
[12:58] all right
[13:00] and God having that before it would ever
[13:03] take place
[13:05] well see then that's not him making you
[13:07] choose
[13:08] as him knowing your choice
[13:10] all right now is everybody with me on
[13:13] that I don't want that thought even in
[13:14] your mind to think about what we used to
[13:17] believe about it
[13:19] well you know if I'm predestinated to be
[13:22] saved I will be and if not I won't
[13:25] you know well you know what you want
[13:28] that's the best way to say it
[13:31] because you hung up on the idea
[13:35] see if God making you do something
[13:39] all right
[13:41] then we'll go back in there and try to
[13:43] prove by the Bible or something they
[13:45] have by like Paul being struck down on
[13:47] the road to Damascus
[13:50] but remember Paul wasn't saved
[13:53] when he was struck down
[13:56] that was just his contact with God
[14:01] come on he wasn't saved until
[14:03] ananiasical to the Bible
[14:06] went over and baptized him and then he
[14:09] received the Holy Ghost
[14:13] because see that way we're not making it
[14:15] a stamped thing
[14:18] but we're also not making it it's just a
[14:20] haphazard well you know let's do the
[14:22] best I can and maybe the Lord will meet
[14:25] me somewhere and you know maybe he's
[14:27] good enough he might save me
[14:30] yeah
[14:31] the prophet of God said we don't even do
[14:33] our business like that
[14:35] you know
[14:36] we don't do it on that basis all right
[14:39] but follow with me now because that's
[14:40] where we we've got to the point now
[14:45] and I was trying to cover there
[14:47] Wednesday night
[14:48] how that there was a time that God dwelt
[14:52] Alone
[14:55] and when he dwelt alone
[14:58] there was nobody with him right
[15:00] now let's get out of our mind one thing
[15:02] for any thoughts whatsoever
[15:06] into our minds because you can go into
[15:09] Mormon doctrines and different doctrines
[15:11] that has come down and plenty of them in
[15:13] this message of trying to make us some
[15:16] kind of a something up in heaven
[15:20] you know
[15:21] making us some kind of a people
[15:24] little identities running around up in
[15:26] heaven
[15:28] well let's get that away from us
[15:30] that'll be the thought for the day
[15:32] is to get away from the fact of
[15:35] believing anything
[15:38] of you and I in our relationship of this
[15:42] world which is Body Spirit Soul living
[15:45] people
[15:46] Etc
[15:47] none of that
[15:49] was before the world
[15:51] that was what he for
[15:53] Saul
[15:57] come on the lives we're living He
[16:00] foresaw it doesn't put us back there
[16:07] which you see we want that idea because
[16:09] it makes some makes us I don't know I
[16:13] guess we're human beings and we we so
[16:15] want to uh
[16:17] be connected in life
[16:19] but why be connected in life with what I
[16:22] don't want to be connected in life once
[16:24] in life
[16:26] we better be connected with what's in
[16:28] God
[16:30] what's in life is a lost situation
[16:33] the best we could do
[16:36] but see we want so much to be something
[16:40] that's that's the ego of human human
[16:43] mankind or people
[16:45] just want to be something
[16:47] and we'll always want to be something
[16:48] greater than anybody else
[16:51] right
[16:53] I mean it's never that people wants to
[16:55] just be happy to be who they are
[16:59] yeah
[17:00] we want to be better than somebody else
[17:03] we want to be something greater
[17:06] well what good is all of that even if
[17:08] you have all that the Bible says it's
[17:10] it's foolishness
[17:14] don't you think the Rich Young Ruler
[17:15] would have been glad to have traded
[17:17] places with
[17:18] Lazarus
[17:22] right
[17:23] amen even to be raised and things he
[17:26] would have sure been gladly loved have
[17:27] been doing that you know
[17:29] well yet he was a good guy
[17:31] he was a good person
[17:33] but yet he was lost
[17:35] all right
[17:37] you see God knew that and he knew
[17:39] whatever he would do with that Rich
[17:41] Young Ruler he talked to him he he
[17:44] communicated with him
[17:47] he offered him salvation
[17:50] but he knew where to hit him at
[17:54] his ego
[17:57] what was his ego money
[18:01] riches
[18:03] what's the ego of mankind to be better
[18:06] than somebody else greater than somebody
[18:07] else richer than somebody else
[18:10] well what if you have it all
[18:13] and lose your soul
[18:16] what good is it
[18:20] that's right and we're not going to go
[18:21] out and burn our money
[18:23] we're not dumb
[18:26] maybe a little bit not a whole lot
[18:31] we're going to live and do the best we
[18:32] can while we're here in life and there's
[18:34] nothing wrong with riches the Bible
[18:36] doesn't say
[18:39] money is the root of all evil does not
[18:41] say that says the Love of Money
[18:44] it's when you let the money override
[18:47] your your life
[18:50] and that's all you got in your mind is
[18:52] money
[18:54] don't worry about it
[18:56] a local he's going to get it pretty
[18:58] quick anyway he's doing all right now
[19:00] taking most of it and but he ain't
[19:03] getting the gas company is getting
[19:05] but think about it now
[19:08] we've been dealing with
[19:11] a a point
[19:14] on predestination that I wanted you to
[19:17] follow me
[19:21] and
[19:24] and let me restate it if you don't get
[19:26] nothing today out of the message
[19:29] all right get this one point
[19:32] I don't believe and never talked don't
[19:36] believe the Bible does I don't believe
[19:37] the prophet does that we were some kind
[19:40] of a people up in heaven somewhere
[19:44] and we're going to get to a point to see
[19:49] the eternal life that we have
[19:55] always was eternal
[19:57] all right now that eternal life that we
[20:00] have now by the new birth
[20:03] was a part of God
[20:06] right
[20:07] all right then that is eternal
[20:11] but you and I as Body Spirit Soul people
[20:13] were lost
[20:16] we have to be born again
[20:19] and even in a born-again experience the
[20:22] new birth is the only the birth of the
[20:23] Soul it's not the body and the spirit
[20:25] you're not born again in those and even
[20:28] if you are anointed on your spirit to do
[20:30] great wonders what are you accomplished
[20:33] confused was a high priest wouldn't he
[20:35] typhus prophesied it was better for one
[20:37] to die for the sins of the people than
[20:39] for a whole nation to die you might have
[20:41] thought that was just him talking but he
[20:42] wouldn't he was under the anointing
[20:47] because that anointing could come on him
[20:50] and you can have that anointing on you
[20:52] every day of your life and die and go to
[20:53] hell and love God the whole time amen
[20:57] amen but what's the main thing
[20:59] it's whether or not that Spirit In You
[21:03] agrees with
[21:05] this word
[21:08] if it don't agree with this word it's
[21:10] not the Holy Spirit
[21:11] if it is the holy spirit it'll agree
[21:13] with this word
[21:14] right
[21:15] if not see then what are we oh yeah boy
[21:19] boy look brother Dale I just shout Glory
[21:21] were wonderful
[21:23] I do too
[21:26] but I want to follow the word
[21:29] that's what I shout about
[21:34] I Rejoice over the word being opened
[21:38] because that word is God himself amen
[21:41] all right and that's why I'm so happy
[21:43] about the word that that's been revealed
[21:45] to us all right
[21:46] but now watch
[21:49] three times four times for knowledge
[21:53] is the knowledge
[21:56] before something takes place
[22:01] all right and knowing that will take
[22:04] place
[22:06] and there's no way to change it from
[22:09] taking place
[22:11] because it's God's foreknowledge
[22:16] no see I I don't agree with mankind on
[22:19] their thoughts even when big brother in
[22:21] this message one time said uh bill and I
[22:24] were talking about how some of the
[22:25] scriptures wouldn't even be fulfilled
[22:26] well I don't believe him
[22:28] because I know where the Prophet said
[22:30] all scriptures got to be fulfilled amen
[22:33] you say you're calling the man alive no
[22:35] he called himself one
[22:37] I didn't have anything to do with it
[22:40] all right
[22:41] but you understand
[22:43] now
[22:45] so remember
[22:46] I want to to bring it up you remember
[22:49] the little drawing that I made just for
[22:51] the purpose of understanding so go ahead
[22:52] and uh
[22:55] and brother pull up the drawing Brother
[22:57] Anderson
[22:59] because I made a drawing specifically
[23:01] these were because they say a picture is
[23:04] better than a thousand words well I done
[23:06] blabbered a whole lot
[23:08] so you can look at one picture maybe you
[23:10] can understand what I'm talking about
[23:13] but you see all over on this side of the
[23:17] line that I've drawed and I made it
[23:19] specifically of the Mind where we'd
[23:21] understand
[23:22] and going through to seeing that God
[23:26] buys foreknowledge
[23:28] he knows all the time we know the lamb
[23:30] according to the Bible was slain before
[23:31] the foundation of the world
[23:33] in all names it would ever be written in
[23:35] the book of life you know the last book
[23:37] of life was written at that time we know
[23:39] all of that but that has to do with your
[23:40] Earthly Journey
[23:45] come on
[23:46] the writing of the lounge Book of Life
[23:49] has to do with your Earthly Journey
[23:52] that's why I quoted it over and over and
[23:54] over now four times knowledge four
[23:57] knowledge is a knowledge before
[24:01] see they wouldn't be no need of having a
[24:03] lounge Book of Life
[24:05] with names written in it
[24:09] if it wasn't going to be a connection to
[24:11] an Earthly Journey
[24:14] we would have just bypassed all of this
[24:16] went right on over and there wouldn't
[24:18] have been any
[24:19] situation
[24:22] but God knew if he made us
[24:24] we would fall
[24:27] you have any problems with that
[24:30] he knew if he made mankind he'd fall
[24:34] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost away
[24:36] from any individual you me brother
[24:40] Branham any individual outside of the
[24:43] Lord Jesus Christ and we're nothing but
[24:45] a mortal Beast
[24:48] subject to Satan
[24:51] now well you'll know how to say that my
[24:53] brother well he wanted to smoke that
[24:55] cigarette
[25:00] you want to talk a little bit we can
[25:02] talk a whole lot
[25:04] see we want to make him some kind of up
[25:06] up above all of us no we don't make him
[25:09] no lowering or nothing he was just God
[25:11] we'll get to it in a minute he was a
[25:12] prophet of God just like Moses
[25:14] Moses had a lot of faults and failures
[25:16] but there's one thing about it Moses
[25:18] done something you and I can't do he
[25:20] went back in the back part of God's mind
[25:22] and wrote the whole book of wrote
[25:24] Genesis Exodus Leviticus number
[25:25] Deuteronomy even wrote of his own death
[25:27] before he died
[25:31] come on it's in the Bible
[25:34] is any problem with that if he could
[25:36] write the beginning my brother's
[25:37] messages preacher he said how can you
[25:39] write of your own death I said you tell
[25:40] me how he knowed what happened in the
[25:42] garden that's right
[25:43] and that's easy to find out he could rot
[25:46] because I could write down right now if
[25:48] the Lord don't come pretty quick I'm
[25:50] gonna die
[25:52] he's had any problem
[25:56] no problem with knowing that part of it
[25:59] but how did he know that beginning
[26:02] where did he get that from what you see
[26:04] everything then your election make your
[26:06] calling an election sure you're calling
[26:08] the mind of God predestination choosing
[26:11] foreknowledge for Saul for no all of
[26:14] that is dealing with cedar word
[26:17] The Plan of Redemption
[26:19] and you could come in and see not moving
[26:21] it on over but just showing that this is
[26:24] God's mind that he knows this will take
[26:26] place then it drops down into time
[26:30] and takes place upon the Earth that's
[26:32] where you get your free will you get
[26:34] your free moral agency we didn't have a
[26:36] free moral agency back here in God's
[26:38] mind
[26:41] wait just a minute now hit a little
[26:44] something didn't I
[26:47] you show me your free will in God's mind
[26:49] Free Will was God knowing now God knew
[26:53] we would have a free will
[26:54] don't misunderstand me
[26:57] he knew but that's his foreknowledge
[26:59] remember for knowledge number five is
[27:02] the knowledge before it happens but by
[27:04] the knowledge it's going to happen
[27:07] so whatever he had here is going to come
[27:11] here
[27:13] right
[27:16] he saw that I've tried to make it see
[27:18] down here we become the word down here
[27:20] we receive the baptism of the Holy and
[27:22] here we receive eternal life
[27:26] all right now when we get to it and the
[27:28] message a little later especially this
[27:30] afternoon and maybe Wednesday night we
[27:32] start talking about how we always was
[27:34] eternal
[27:36] didn't just remember what we said
[27:39] the only way you can have eternal life
[27:40] is to receive eternal life
[27:43] gold if not you did not need a savior
[27:48] Jesus Christ died in vain
[27:51] if you think you always was eternal
[27:53] well I got 49 quotes well don't worry
[27:56] about it
[28:00] we're going to see what it means right
[28:02] was everybody following me
[28:04] now God in his foreknowledge and all of
[28:07] the things
[28:08] that was in his mind the book of life
[28:11] was written
[28:13] through the lounge Book of Life was
[28:15] written
[28:17] but when he wrote the Lamb's Book of
[28:19] Life
[28:21] and you say well there's only names in
[28:22] that right amen all agree with you
[28:24] because we're not talking about a book
[28:25] like a piece of paper with names on it
[28:28] God don't have to have that to keep
[28:30] records the computer shows that
[28:33] right you can go
[28:36] some of you I can't even remember your
[28:37] name you see you're crazy no I can't
[28:40] remember nothing I'm sorry
[28:42] but my you know my computer never forget
[28:44] all I got to do is
[28:46] it it'll come up
[28:50] that's greater than a piece of paper to
[28:52] write on
[28:53] but God don't need that he's the one
[28:55] that helped him design the computer
[28:57] but Iran said it broke into God's
[28:58] laboratory right
[29:00] look at what they're doing you explain
[29:02] to me how that computer works
[29:05] you explain to me how that over on the
[29:07] other side of the world right now 12
[29:09] hours away of course they're in a
[29:11] different day
[29:12] but they can sit right there and watch
[29:13] your service you explain that to me and
[29:16] you know we don't have to talk about the
[29:17] rest of it
[29:18] but look see here's where we have the
[29:20] Redemptive plan we have the the word of
[29:23] God coming forth here's where we have
[29:25] over here in life is where we have the
[29:28] whosoever will
[29:30] the predestination is dealing in our
[29:33] lives so watch it now I was going to
[29:37] title a message and hadn't done it yet
[29:38] the condescending of God because that's
[29:40] what he's doing here to here to here
[29:46] then that way we can see where we're at
[29:50] and realize this is
[29:53] so I ask you the question
[29:55] I'll ask you this many times over the
[29:57] 40-something years
[30:00] did God sit back there and look down or
[30:02] is this what he's looking at
[30:05] he said well this is what he's looking
[30:06] at we know for sure well then was he
[30:08] back there or is he here now
[30:12] come on
[30:13] you know the brother Dale I thought he
[30:15] sat back there and looked at it you know
[30:16] why have him sit back and look at it
[30:19] when he knows all about the whole thing
[30:22] did he have to think it over before he
[30:24] would come into being
[30:26] now come on
[30:28] we're talking about an infinite God
[30:32] a God that knows all things
[30:39] and we're not going to pull anything
[30:40] over on anyone our smart ick ideas
[30:44] so we might as well forget it and just
[30:45] settle down
[30:47] all right
[30:49] see then there was a time that that we
[30:51] could only have in the terminologies of
[30:54] of of the authors and and the
[30:56] theologians ETC and the writings of
[31:00] Bringing Down the Bible to us
[31:02] the word god
[31:04] is where you come into Genesis 1.
[31:09] in the beginning God created all right
[31:11] that word god
[31:13] at that point
[31:15] is coming downward our condescending
[31:19] and the best you can do there is to use
[31:22] the word Elohim or him every how you
[31:25] want to pronounce it
[31:30] meaning self-existing right
[31:36] now if he's self-existing then how could
[31:38] we be up there with him
[31:43] so let's get all that out of her mind
[31:44] see
[31:46] even the thoughts about it how could he
[31:48] be self-existent if we were there with
[31:49] him
[31:52] now the only form that anything
[31:54] connection to the human being has to
[31:57] what would be self-existing we would
[32:00] have to receive the life
[32:03] of the one that self-existing
[32:06] are you with me
[32:08] that would be the only way you can talk
[32:10] about self-existing
[32:13] you can't talk about it as Little
[32:15] People's little deaths and little doubts
[32:18] now you can only talk about it as
[32:21] that eternal life that you have
[32:24] was in God before the world
[32:26] all right
[32:27] now but that's what we're trying to get
[32:29] to to find out see
[32:32] to see the day and the hour that we're
[32:34] living
[32:38] and we believe
[32:40] do we not believe that this is the end
[32:42] time
[32:43] you know not making no dates times or
[32:45] Seasons we never have
[32:46] I proved to you years ago we comprised
[32:48] 2026 for the prophet's message and still
[32:51] not have no problems
[32:54] all right you can calculate that that
[32:56] means we've got about 13 more years
[32:58] 13 more years I'm going to be pretty old
[33:01] and so are most to you
[33:05] all right there's going to be a lot of
[33:06] little bat little Mounds up a dirt
[33:08] pushed out to me you know because and we
[33:10] ain't going to make it that far
[33:12] and the way things is going now I don't
[33:14] think we will make it that far
[33:16] but now
[33:18] get the point
[33:23] we what we talk about
[33:26] what I've always heard preachers try to
[33:28] preach is dealing with these realms
[33:32] here
[33:34] thinking they're back here
[33:38] now if you're dealing with rims of this
[33:41] being God's mind and his foreknowledge
[33:42] you got a part but what about when you
[33:45] get over here to seeing yourself you
[33:47] can't bring yourself back here he would
[33:49] no longer be self-existing
[33:54] I mean I got a ninth grade education
[33:55] that's sensible to me
[33:58] maybe with too much education is what
[34:00] messes us up
[34:01] we don't have anything against it I wish
[34:03] I could have got more but I played a
[34:05] mule all day I wasn't able to go to
[34:06] school
[34:08] but listen
[34:12] if he dwelt alone that was the end of
[34:14] the message Wednesday
[34:16] that God dwelt Alone
[34:23] see he was self-existing
[34:26] there was nobody dwelt with him
[34:29] he created angels first
[34:33] and they worshiped him
[34:35] and that gave him the word God in
[34:38] Genesis 1.
[34:40] because God means an object of worship
[34:43] there was nothing to worship him when he
[34:45] was self-existing
[34:47] he said well what was his name
[34:49] there's no way to put a name there
[34:52] I'll tell you what his name was if you
[34:54] want to know because it takes about 40
[34:56] years to understand it but his name was
[34:58] Jesus
[35:03] so Jesus dwelt alone he said no that
[35:05] can't be called g-a-e-s means us with
[35:08] him now that's coming this way
[35:13] that's coming on down this way all right
[35:15] that gets us over here
[35:18] but remember Jehovah's not a name
[35:23] I'm talking to a Jehovah Witness people
[35:25] one day and they were saying Jehovah's
[35:26] tonight I said would you tell me the
[35:28] scripture says by my name Jehovah's I
[35:30] never know
[35:33] I mean that's Bible he said by my name's
[35:35] Jehovah has never known
[35:37] all right Jehovah was put on
[35:41] as to give understanding because really
[35:43] it's jvhv or jvhu as some will use
[35:48] and that way then you're bringing it j v
[35:51] h v
[35:52] as having no vowels Etc in your English
[35:56] Majors you know
[35:58] you can't pronounce it
[36:01] see there's no way to pronounce it
[36:04] all right
[36:05] so they put on to that and made it
[36:09] Jehovah into the English language
[36:11] bringing it down
[36:14] but I love the meaning of Jehovah
[36:18] because Jehovah means like a father with
[36:21] his family
[36:23] I love that meaning
[36:26] you've got to put Lord God together in
[36:28] Genesis to come out to the correct
[36:30] understanding
[36:34] see the Elohim the self-existing one
[36:38] created angels and they worshiped him
[36:40] now you got the title of God
[36:45] all right but just remember
[36:47] he was still existing alone
[36:51] he said wait just a minute now you
[36:53] trapped yourself there because he
[36:54] created angel
[36:55] s are not people
[37:00] you never had anybody like himself
[37:04] he created angels first and they
[37:06] worshiped him that made him God
[37:10] then you've got to get over about
[37:11] Genesis 2 to where you pick up the word
[37:13] Lord God meaning Jehovah Elohim
[37:18] he created man in Genesis 1.
[37:22] right let us make Manning on him then
[37:24] when he did you pick up the title
[37:26] Jehovah
[37:28] I love it when the prophet will get to
[37:30] it in a minute we have time where he
[37:32] said
[37:32] he'll never be self-existing
[37:37] but those angels were not like him
[37:40] he wanted somebody like him
[37:44] but just remember you say well how did
[37:47] you come up with the name of Jesus
[37:48] because that's what according to the
[37:50] Bible
[37:53] that he was to be called Emmanuel which
[37:56] was God With Us
[37:58] and said you'll call his name Jesus
[38:01] no
[38:03] Jesus means Jehovah's savior Jehovah see
[38:06] running all the way back to Joshua
[38:08] because the word Joshua actually deals
[38:10] which with Jesus coming down as an
[38:13] understanding
[38:16] and you won't Bible now
[38:18] all right we'll get in the Bible
[38:21] Jesus said one day he said I come in my
[38:24] father's name
[38:29] now what would be the name of the father
[38:30] then
[38:33] no no no no no no no no you don't matter
[38:35] that means a brother Carly went in my
[38:37] name that's human terminologies we can't
[38:40] deal out of the way in Bible terminology
[38:43] he said I come in my father's name
[38:48] didn't he tell us to ask all in the name
[38:50] of Jesus
[38:51] then he turned around one day and said
[38:53] ask the father anything in my name
[38:55] well what's the problem with
[38:57] understanding Jesus is his name
[39:00] to me that means a great deal
[39:04] you see yeah but one of these days
[39:05] you're going to have a new name I ain't
[39:06] worried about that I'm worried about his
[39:08] name Jesus because Jesus has to do with
[39:10] Redemption
[39:12] so until that we're here in this form
[39:15] until we're changed and going out of
[39:17] here we don't worry about a new name
[39:20] well now what it is we've got to get a
[39:22] new name to be able to be changed
[39:26] uh according to my understanding the
[39:29] name of Jesus is the name of redemption
[39:33] so that would cover your entire Journey
[39:35] and the change
[39:39] and then you could talk about a new name
[39:42] yeah but you just I know it I'm just
[39:44] that dumb I just I just like to stay
[39:47] down here on Earth because we're here
[39:48] that's what I've always said about the
[39:50] people people are in this message are
[39:52] too Heavenly minded
[39:54] to be of any sensible use on Earth
[40:00] right
[40:04] place this brother's got have you heard
[40:06] that
[40:07] have you heard the tapes on so-and-so
[40:11] well just keep watching him after a
[40:13] while
[40:14] if he's writing a lineup if not he'll go
[40:16] get mad three or four times mess it all
[40:18] up
[40:19] or take a bunch of girls
[40:22] I ain't throwing no jokes it's true
[40:26] every one of these seed doctrines you
[40:27] name a Seed doctrine I can tell you
[40:30] where the head of it went
[40:34] but everybody wants to talk about a seed
[40:36] we ain't even got back to talk about a
[40:38] seed
[40:41] he said brother I believe in a
[40:43] predestinated
[40:45] Eternal seed
[40:49] if I'm going to believe in eternal life
[40:55] but I also believe as human beings and
[40:57] Mortals we came into a world had lost
[40:59] and doomed and on the way to hell and
[41:02] we've got to be born again before that
[41:04] seed can catch up with us in any way
[41:09] me
[41:11] the prophet said about the little woman
[41:13] at the well said she had representation
[41:14] from predestination
[41:17] another time he said by predestination
[41:19] all right this representation from or by
[41:21] predestination then predestination is by
[41:24] what
[41:25] for knowledge which means knowledge
[41:27] before of what's going to be on earth
[41:30] all right
[41:32] so you keep ourselves down here and get
[41:35] an understanding
[41:39] so let's go ahead brother
[41:41] news number four and we'll
[41:43] start with it this is where we we had a
[41:45] couple of quotes Wednesday night
[41:47] but I don't want to get this off of you
[41:49] I want this to stay on your mind until
[41:51] you see it
[41:56] and look what the prophet of God had to
[41:58] say about these things
[42:00] this is from Christ's mystery God reveal
[42:02] 1963 728
[42:04] paragraph 102 and 103.
[42:08] now God's
[42:10] secret mystery
[42:12] he had before the world begun
[42:15] now back in the back part
[42:18] of God's mind
[42:21] there was something that he was going
[42:23] was trying and was going to achieve he
[42:26] had a motive in doing it what was his
[42:27] motive in order to let himself be
[42:29] expressed
[42:30] all right
[42:32] but think about it
[42:34] in the back part of God's mind
[42:39] I wrote my own self a note where we'd
[42:41] make sure not to
[42:44] miss it
[42:49] you say well
[42:51] brother so and so
[42:54] preached
[42:56] two souls and others two Lords others
[43:00] perusias all kind of doctrines they all
[43:04] said that they had the mind of God
[43:09] right they said God told showed it to
[43:12] him come on all right right
[43:16] they said God revealed it to him then it
[43:18] was a great mystery
[43:22] the only thing I want to know is because
[43:24] see I don't claim to have that
[43:29] I want to know how you got it
[43:34] how did you get a great great revelation
[43:36] of what this is or that is
[43:39] that's all I want to know well I got it
[43:41] from the Holy Ghost
[43:42] well why didn't the Holy Ghost use you
[43:48] are we supposed to follow you
[43:57] you see that tears up doctrines don't
[43:59] you
[44:02] but he should tear up our little bitty
[44:03] pity ideas in her mind of what we think
[44:05] we are
[44:09] just remember Amos 3 and 7 says that
[44:12] he'll do nothing but reveal his secrets
[44:14] to His prophets
[44:17] well I've got the Holy Ghost you mean he
[44:19] can't reveal it to me no he can't
[44:21] is that plain
[44:23] he didn't
[44:28] right
[44:32] what's with you or not I'm not throwing
[44:34] off on people I'm trying to make it
[44:35] right where you can understand but with
[44:37] your Holy Ghost did you know what took
[44:38] place in Genesis
[44:44] no we all thought Evie to Apple and gave
[44:48] adam an apple and had a bellyache
[44:51] foreign
[44:56] oh we know it was unbelief
[44:59] sure
[45:05] what you think about Moses
[45:07] and you'll see what I'm talking about
[45:10] that Moses could write Genesis Leviticus
[45:13] Numbers Deuteronomy
[45:18] from the mind of God
[45:21] that was the back part
[45:24] of God's mind
[45:26] I tried to explain it Wednesday night as
[45:28] a human and being the best I can do
[45:31] the front part of your mind is your
[45:33] intelligence
[45:34] that is known as your conscious part of
[45:36] you the front part is your intelligence
[45:39] your your your ability to communicate
[45:42] and operate to do
[45:44] in the back part of your mind is called
[45:46] a subconscious
[45:49] and in that subconscious is where you
[45:51] dream where you do and when you go to
[45:53] sleep that's what keeps you alive
[45:57] is a subconscious
[45:59] all right
[46:03] we can have dreams and Visions right
[46:05] because we have a partial connection to
[46:08] a subconscious part of us
[46:11] but a prophet they told brought around
[46:13] said you could dream a dream and stand
[46:14] there Wide Awake
[46:16] they could prove it by their machinery
[46:19] see because the prophet's conscious
[46:21] conscious and subconscious is right
[46:23] together that's the way he explained it
[46:26] so Moses could go back in the back part
[46:29] of God's mind
[46:33] and tell what happened in the garden
[46:34] with Adam and Eve
[46:39] we know some of the other things he
[46:41] could record as he was living
[46:43] because he lived out through it going
[46:44] down through the journeys we went here
[46:45] we went there we done this
[46:51] but what about getting the mind of God
[46:56] go back in the back part of God's mind
[46:58] into that subconscious part of you call
[47:01] it or whatever and bringing forth those
[47:03] great things
[47:05] see those prophets had a connection
[47:09] that's why they could not deal with them
[47:11] mankind couldn't deal with the prophets
[47:12] sure they could kill them they done
[47:14] everything but they couldn't deal with
[47:15] them
[47:16] what about Isaiah standing there one day
[47:18] how would you like to been one and
[47:20] walked out in front of a whole group of
[47:21] people like this instead of Virgin shall
[47:23] conceive
[47:26] would you like to done that would you
[47:27] like to do it now walk down the street
[47:29] out here you're going to be in a
[47:30] straight jacket before long
[47:35] but you see Isaiah could say from the
[47:38] mind of God
[47:40] a virgin shall conceive
[47:43] and I shall call his name Emmanuel
[47:47] look how those prophets could pick up
[47:49] as great as John the Baptist was
[47:54] like I've always tried to explain to you
[47:57] the prophet of God made a statement one
[47:58] day that really helped me to understand
[48:02] he said that John was told said when you
[48:05] see that Holy Spirit come down and
[48:06] remain
[48:09] I thought oh God there's just give it
[48:11] all
[48:12] because John could stand out there and
[48:15] see Caiaphas and under the anointing of
[48:17] the Holy Spirit to prophesy
[48:21] right
[48:23] come on
[48:25] even Saul went down under the Sprout
[48:28] spout as we call it
[48:30] and come out prophesying
[48:36] John look at that and he could see that
[48:38] anointing strike at high priest he's
[48:40] wondering is this the guy I'm supposed
[48:41] to introduce
[48:44] because that's what he was told
[48:46] the one you see the Holy Spirit descend
[48:50] and remain
[48:54] is the one you introduce
[48:58] so we can seek office he could come in
[49:00] and go out
[49:01] he knew those High priests were under
[49:03] the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[49:04] remember his daddy was priests coming
[49:07] down
[49:08] he knew the lineup
[49:11] but when he seen Jesus and he's seen the
[49:13] Holy Spirit descending on the River
[49:14] Jordan and it never left him
[49:17] he said Behold the Lamb of God that
[49:20] takes away the sin of the world the mind
[49:22] of God had become into a reality through
[49:24] a man's lips
[49:29] God put the thought into John's mind and
[49:32] brought it down and John spoke it it
[49:34] become word
[49:38] see what are we talking about
[49:41] we've had a prophet to bring us the word
[49:42] of God
[49:44] yet look what they're trying to do with
[49:45] this message didn't denying it and
[49:47] cutting it into pieces
[49:52] that's all right they got their judgment
[49:53] because that before knowledge before the
[49:55] foundation of the world had to be
[49:57] because it can't be no other way
[50:00] the Bible says there must needs to be
[50:03] heresies among you
[50:06] it didn't say maybe they'll come or you
[50:08] know the Bible says they must need to be
[50:11] heresies among you why
[50:13] that they that are approved
[50:16] are correct
[50:18] or right
[50:20] shall be made manifest
[50:24] the best way to know truth is to go talk
[50:26] to somebody that's telling you a lot of
[50:28] error
[50:30] and then if the Holy Ghost in you can't
[50:32] set that thing astray and say wait a
[50:34] minute I don't know how to answer but
[50:35] there's something wrong right
[50:38] it's just something the person said
[50:40] ain't right
[50:42] that way you'll get away from all these
[50:44] doctrines
[50:47] and you won't be falling after him
[50:50] but you see
[50:51] go back in the back part of God's mind
[50:57] that God had a plan and a purpose
[51:00] in doing it
[51:01] to let himself be expressed
[51:06] all right
[51:08] in him was attributes as we call it what
[51:10] is an attribute
[51:12] your children or your attributes
[51:13] displayed down because they were in you
[51:16] into the mail you know coming down you
[51:18] got to have a female too but
[51:21] attributes
[51:26] now
[51:28] a prophet would use an illustration
[51:30] about an attribute
[51:32] and he'd say uh you're an attribute of
[51:35] your father
[51:38] said you was in your father
[51:41] before you ever come into the world
[51:46] then he makes an outstanding statement
[51:48] and he says every Apple that will ever
[51:51] be on that tree
[51:55] was in that one little seed
[51:58] that brought forth the apple tree
[52:03] thousands of bushels of apples
[52:06] come off of the tree
[52:10] now how was they all in there
[52:17] oh they was packed in there oh yeah yeah
[52:21] go ahead
[52:25] do you realize what he's just saying
[52:26] that you were in your father that you
[52:29] were in your grandfather
[52:33] they can prove by DNA
[52:36] who you belong to
[52:39] who your daddy is who your granddaddy is
[52:41] who's your great granddaddy is I can
[52:42] just keep running your genealogy all the
[52:44] way back right
[52:45] they can do the same thing with the
[52:46] woman's out of it
[52:51] but you see then an attribute
[52:54] is not something standing there with you
[53:01] like my kids
[53:04] they were in me when I was born
[53:07] or where'd they come from
[53:11] that's why I always tell them they're
[53:12] not mcgillicuddies
[53:14] come on now I hope nobody wouldn't be
[53:16] guilty Angus
[53:17] they're not Miguel cuties they're Dales
[53:19] well they can prove it by the bloodline
[53:25] but you see then that way if we can even
[53:28] get one bit of a fathom of a thought
[53:31] of however Apple could ever be on a tree
[53:36] would be in that one seed when it was
[53:39] planted
[53:40] or how that you could be in your daddy
[53:43] your granddaddy your great granddaddy or
[53:45] just keep going on back
[53:49] if we can even fathom that as a thought
[53:54] you know any comprehension of whatever
[53:56] could be
[53:57] and we just begin to see how God was
[54:02] when he dwelt alone
[54:09] but in him dwelling alone in him he had
[54:13] attributes
[54:22] in him he had thoughts
[54:30] true
[54:33] and in him he didn't have eternal life
[54:37] I want that the coast good
[54:39] he was eternal life
[54:45] so you're going to see when I get back
[54:46] to it to the point maybe this evening
[54:48] sometime
[54:50] I don't want to be just in the mind of
[54:53] God right
[54:54] because everybody in the world
[54:58] in some form or other has been in the
[55:01] mind of God
[55:02] or his thinking
[55:06] I said this 40 years ago what is it I
[55:08] don't want to be part of his thoughts I
[55:10] want to be part of the Thinker
[55:13] the one who done the thinking
[55:16] because that's the only way you can have
[55:18] eternal life
[55:24] be part of that Eternal God Amen
[55:29] see ya
[55:31] and now you make it pre-existence I
[55:33] certainly am pre-existence of eternal
[55:36] life
[55:40] tell everybody that brother Dale
[55:41] believes in pre-existence of eternal
[55:44] life
[55:49] but don't cut the tape off when I said
[55:50] pre-existence make sure you put eternal
[55:53] life with it
[55:59] and made a statement and sister asked me
[56:01] the other day and I've tried to explain
[56:02] it but I said be careful how you start
[56:05] all this predestination Doctrine you're
[56:06] going to predestinate yourself out of
[56:08] existence
[56:12] if you have to agree and you must that
[56:15] there was a time he was self-existing
[56:20] then if we can't go back to that part
[56:24] and get to that state of being
[56:27] that would be there
[56:29] then you would predestinate yourself out
[56:31] of existence
[56:36] Come Home Folks
[56:39] them thoughts don't come from
[56:42] well forget it
[56:46] see we've been dealing with
[56:49] what would take place here
[56:53] the foreknowledge is the predestinations
[56:57] dealing with the things that are reality
[57:00] life existence
[57:02] now we're looking back by the prophet of
[57:05] God to speak of the mind of God
[57:09] as the back part of God's mind
[57:14] and then Wednesday night we went through
[57:16] and through and through trying to show
[57:18] the point in reading the thing
[57:22] were the prophet of God would use it
[57:25] that God dwelt Alone
[57:32] then there's no capability of us in any
[57:34] form that's trying to be back there
[57:40] and one thing I've never understood
[57:42] human ego
[57:48] I've never understood that
[57:51] about any others
[57:55] because why is a human ego not wanting
[57:58] God to be number one
[58:01] now you tell me human ego wants God to
[58:03] be one I'm going to tell you you're a
[58:04] liar to your face
[58:06] no ain't no life about it
[58:09] human ego is nothing to do with you
[58:11] trying to make God great
[58:13] human ego have to do are you trying to
[58:15] be great
[58:19] that ought to be enough to to annihilate
[58:21] all of the thoughts of egos
[58:25] you know I preached that first
[58:28] bless God I'm I'm the first one
[58:31] okay
[58:31] what kind of an ego you got
[58:34] you got a number one guy first ego
[58:39] now let's go look a step further but I
[58:41] didn't mean to go this way on this part
[58:42] but all right we'll go
[58:45] why is it the human ego don't deal with
[58:47] the spirit that's within you
[58:54] think a second you understand what I'm
[58:56] saying
[58:58] the human ego of the inward part of man
[59:01] the soul
[59:06] does not want God to be number one
[59:10] unless he's born again
[59:13] that changes the ego of the Soul right
[59:18] the ego of the soul is what the new
[59:20] birth you've got to change that
[59:23] right then it puts God first
[59:29] but even after you put the new birth
[59:33] within the soul changing the ego
[59:36] of the person
[59:39] I'm looking at a display of egos
[59:43] because I cannot see your spirit Realm
[59:46] you can deceive me you can be set in our
[59:48] wishing I wish you'd hurry up and other
[59:49] would be sitting there I wish he'd
[59:51] explain what he's talking about so I'm
[59:52] saying well dinner's getting ready
[59:56] that's all in your spirit Realm
[1:00:01] but why is it that every ego boosts this
[1:00:03] man
[1:00:06] now you tell me it don't ever ego that's
[1:00:09] ever been in the world is this wanting
[1:00:11] to boost this man this flesh
[1:00:17] Ponce de Leon
[1:00:19] sail the world to try to find what
[1:00:23] the Fountain of Youth
[1:00:27] right
[1:00:30] nobody wanted it and somebody was able
[1:00:33] capable of spending a lot of money
[1:00:36] he wanted to find something or somebody
[1:00:39] sent him out looking for it
[1:00:45] why didn't he go down to the church and
[1:00:46] talk to them
[1:00:49] oh brother Dale had this through her for
[1:00:50] their soul all right you just caught
[1:00:51] what I'm talking about now
[1:00:54] Ponce de Leon wanted something for this
[1:00:57] this is what we want
[1:00:59] this is what we won't satisfy this is
[1:01:01] where we want our this is our ego
[1:01:08] is our bodies
[1:01:11] and you tell me that ain't right then
[1:01:12] I'll ask you the question why is it
[1:01:14] every doctor in this message that's when
[1:01:16] after human egos hadn't went to the
[1:01:18] flesh
[1:01:22] come on you've been around long enough
[1:01:23] many of you know all about it
[1:01:25] you've heard about it and you know about
[1:01:27] these doctrines and how they go where
[1:01:29] did they go
[1:01:30] does it lift God up
[1:01:37] does it even get into the spiritual
[1:01:39] Realm
[1:01:42] it's into this man here he said wait a
[1:01:44] minute because this man ain't working
[1:01:45] I'll agree with you I got sense
[1:01:48] his body can't work without it but why
[1:01:50] is that Spirit working back up on this
[1:01:52] body even as we're born again Christians
[1:01:55] you understand where I'm going Born
[1:01:57] Again Christians
[1:02:06] come on
[1:02:08] ain't nothing wrong with looking nice we
[1:02:10] are too I wish I could but
[1:02:15] I'm not throwing off on it I'm just
[1:02:16] trying to tell you the truth
[1:02:18] there's more muscles been strained in
[1:02:23] front of a mirror
[1:02:25] then lifting weights
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:31] we listen to the tape the other day I
[1:02:34] got tickled ribbon
[1:02:37] run around and we're talking about the
[1:02:38] Christian Life and how it comes in and
[1:02:40] takes over things
[1:02:41] in any evidently was just in his
[1:02:43] beginning because of what he was saying
[1:02:45] he's just a young boy you know he wasn't
[1:02:47] married and you know he was standing
[1:02:49] there and he was talking about the Lord
[1:02:51] and how great it was and how the Lord
[1:02:52] had come along he said this girl walks
[1:02:54] by and said she drops her handkerchief
[1:03:00] well you know what that is come on that
[1:03:02] was the way the girls are old days now
[1:03:04] young girls you're different now you
[1:03:06] don't do it that way right you just go
[1:03:08] right after him
[1:03:11] right the old days the girl would drop a
[1:03:14] handkerchief or something you pick up oh
[1:03:16] Ma'am you dropped your handkerchief back
[1:03:18] to her she's oh thank you
[1:03:21] you'd unhooked
[1:03:23] you got a date for the night and
[1:03:25] everything going on right
[1:03:27] but brother random said he was standing
[1:03:28] there and said just let you walk my girl
[1:03:31] and dropped her hands he said ma'am you
[1:03:33] dropped your hand could you
[1:03:35] I said well
[1:03:38] something was done took over that man
[1:03:40] you know he wasn't interested in the
[1:03:43] date
[1:03:46] but why is that ego I didn't mean to
[1:03:48] maybe go to title isn't he called
[1:03:49] brother show but just leave it
[1:03:53] an ego in an individual
[1:03:58] in life that we're living and we think
[1:04:00] that's more important than anything else
[1:04:05] now answer me this one today answer me
[1:04:10] what do you call that big old word
[1:04:12] hypothesis or what is it what is that
[1:04:15] big old thing where you make a great big
[1:04:16] story out of something
[1:04:18] okay y'all pronounce it I can
[1:04:22] what if today
[1:04:27] that they put in a paper or
[1:04:30] brother Joe could read it off the
[1:04:32] internet and come out here and pass out
[1:04:33] to everybody in the church
[1:04:38] a piece of paper
[1:04:40] that up in Hall County Hospital
[1:04:42] they just found an instant cure for old
[1:04:46] age
[1:04:49] make everybody 18.
[1:04:54] instantly just
[1:04:59] you got to be there at two o'clock
[1:05:05] how many would be here
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:14] do you understand not making a joke
[1:05:15] making a truth
[1:05:19] s were more interested in the ego of
[1:05:21] this part I hear than we are the soul
[1:05:23] and the individual that could receive
[1:05:26] eternal life and hearing the word of God
[1:05:28] to be able to be changed in made 18 20
[1:05:31] year old and never never have to die
[1:05:33] again
[1:05:37] what about it
[1:05:41] I've heard Brother Gary back there say
[1:05:45] we get one of them migraine headaches
[1:05:48] he said just take a pistol and blow
[1:05:54] somebody's head off to get rid of that
[1:05:56] headache
[1:05:57] and you'd think about doing it
[1:06:01] that's just human egos
[1:06:05] but listen Church
[1:06:07] there's no part of us in an ego form up
[1:06:10] in heaven
[1:06:12] as we start approaching the things I try
[1:06:15] to get a little bit Wednesday night to
[1:06:17] line up to just think about it
[1:06:24] we're not trying I I quit trying a long
[1:06:26] time ago to go to heaven
[1:06:30] because I found out that all of it's got
[1:06:32] to take here placed here before I can go
[1:06:33] up to her
[1:06:34] well I'm interested in what's taking
[1:06:36] place here the dead in Christ who rise
[1:06:37] first and we which are alive in our mind
[1:06:39] be changed and won't require I'm
[1:06:40] interested in what's taking place in
[1:06:41] here we're not going to heaven to be
[1:06:43] made eternal
[1:06:47] we'll get out all out of your mind then
[1:06:49] quit trying to figure out how you was
[1:06:50] back there
[1:06:54] Napoleon I just believe I feel like I
[1:06:56] was
[1:07:00] but listen Church
[1:07:03] there is no part of us
[1:07:05] as a human mortal of a body spirit and
[1:07:08] soul of a human mortal now when I come
[1:07:10] back to it later don't carry down on me
[1:07:13] and say you said so
[1:07:15] I said as a human mortal soul
[1:07:18] that is lost and doomed and everybody
[1:07:21] was except the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:28] there's none of that in heaven
[1:07:34] he said well what about this we get to
[1:07:35] the soul that's right so you better get
[1:07:37] to the soul in the correct way
[1:07:42] all right
[1:07:44] see God had attributes that he wanted to
[1:07:46] be displayed but he dwelt alone
[1:07:51] I gave them to you Wednesday where he
[1:07:52] said he didn't intend for no man to ever
[1:07:55] to be lost
[1:07:59] he never intended in any form for us to
[1:08:02] be lost
[1:08:06] so what were we back there
[1:08:09] what were we back there
[1:08:14] let's start on nine I'll try to read
[1:08:16] real fast okay
[1:08:18] go to number nine brother and we'll try
[1:08:19] to get it
[1:08:24] who do you say this is preached in 1964
[1:08:27] paragraph 67. that's the way he was he
[1:08:29] was in the beginning by himself God
[1:08:31] dwelt Alone with his stalks he'll never
[1:08:33] do that again I love that
[1:08:36] if you don't get nothing out of it you
[1:08:38] get that little statement he'll never do
[1:08:41] that again
[1:08:44] he'll never be self-existing
[1:08:47] there is no name to be tied on to him as
[1:08:50] a new name or some kind of a
[1:08:51] self-existing
[1:08:54] you can only start off by Elohim
[1:08:57] self-existing one
[1:09:00] but when he created Mankind and made a
[1:09:03] man like himself he'll never be
[1:09:05] self-existing again
[1:09:09] can't be
[1:09:15] what is it because his thoughts are
[1:09:17] being made manifest and that's why we
[1:09:19] are right here this day Lula Georgia
[1:09:22] he is God fellowshipping with his
[1:09:24] thoughts
[1:09:25] being made manifest
[1:09:28] oh yeah
[1:09:30] how many times have we went over that
[1:09:34] where the prophet of God said what
[1:09:36] look at number
[1:09:39] we'll go ahead with number 10 let's read
[1:09:40] five
[1:09:43] taken who is this melted in the
[1:09:46] beginning God dwelt Alone with his
[1:09:47] attributes as I spoke of this morning
[1:09:49] that's his thoughts
[1:09:54] now he dwelt alone with his attributes
[1:09:57] that's his thoughts
[1:09:59] well now why are we going to try to be
[1:10:01] back there
[1:10:05] well I want to be an attribute an
[1:10:07] attribute of a Healer
[1:10:09] a savior
[1:10:13] now come on
[1:10:14] there wasn't nothing sick In Heaven
[1:10:16] There wasn't nothing lost in heaven
[1:10:19] see we could spend hours on this thought
[1:10:20] if not see Satan and him fought in
[1:10:22] heaven but there was nobody there fought
[1:10:24] it with him they wouldn't know Souls
[1:10:26] joining up and battling
[1:10:29] Satan ain't a soul
[1:10:31] he's not a person he's a created being
[1:10:36] he can never be saved
[1:10:38] thank you thank you thank you
[1:10:43] sin originated in heaven through the
[1:10:45] Angels but not us
[1:10:50] are you reading it
[1:10:52] there's nothing but God alone but he had
[1:10:54] thoughts
[1:10:55] just like an architect sets down you
[1:10:57] know and he draws out his talks he's
[1:10:59] explaining it like his thoughts the way
[1:11:01] he's thinking
[1:11:04] but yet remember one thing
[1:11:07] while he was thinking you and I was not
[1:11:10] in existence
[1:11:15] he was only thinking about us
[1:11:18] even all of the line that went over this
[1:11:20] away coming down is only him thinking
[1:11:23] about us
[1:11:26] it's not us up there
[1:11:29] he was only thinking about us the lounge
[1:11:31] Book of Life was written for the
[1:11:32] foundation world we wouldn't slain in
[1:11:34] heaven I mean he wasn't slain in heaven
[1:11:36] and we didn't die in heaven
[1:11:38] everything's down here
[1:11:44] but he was self-existing
[1:11:47] he dwelt alone
[1:11:52] just his thoughts now let me end it I
[1:11:55] won't read the rest of these we'll pick
[1:11:56] up this evening let me ask you something
[1:11:58] about God's thoughts
[1:12:06] let me ask you a question
[1:12:08] are your thoughts a part of you
[1:12:12] don't raise your hand because I don't
[1:12:13] got some more to go behind you okay
[1:12:16] see because I like to trap you that away
[1:12:18] but I like what you think
[1:12:20] do you think your thoughts is a part of
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:24] and where's a dirty one come from
[1:12:31] come on
[1:12:34] well me and my thoughts are the same you
[1:12:37] better be careful you just thought the
[1:12:40] wrong thing
[1:12:42] because if you and your thoughts are the
[1:12:44] same and Satan comes in and puts the
[1:12:46] thought in
[1:12:47] oh
[1:12:51] no just explaining a thought
[1:12:56] so we know that our thoughts are not
[1:12:59] like his thoughts as the Bible said and
[1:13:01] our ways are not like his ways that's
[1:13:02] what the scripture says
[1:13:05] you see I can be doing wonderful with
[1:13:08] thoughts how many agree and all at once
[1:13:10] Here Comes something then it's just
[1:13:15] even dirty thoughts
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:19] you brother there you have dirty
[1:13:20] thoughts yeah you do too so quit lying
[1:13:24] quit critical super religious
[1:13:28] you're a human
[1:13:30] if Satan can't tempt you you would have
[1:13:33] to be God could he even tempted Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ
[1:13:39] come on read your Bible
[1:13:44] turn these stones into bread he was
[1:13:46] hungry
[1:13:51] prophet of God coming along and adding
[1:13:53] it to her to say that Jesus was even
[1:13:55] tempted by women you say well I don't
[1:13:57] like that statement well let's forget it
[1:13:58] then it's the truth
[1:14:01] but he didn't yield to his temptation
[1:14:03] there's a lot of difference in it
[1:14:06] nothing wrong with the thought
[1:14:09] it's entertaining the thought right
[1:14:12] Satan's thoughts coming in is going to
[1:14:14] be an automatic part of life day
[1:14:20] but yet turning them down and not
[1:14:22] entertaining them
[1:14:29] see then what is my point you say
[1:14:32] Judas Iscariot was a part of God in his
[1:14:35] thinking
[1:14:38] now I didn't say part of God like Born
[1:14:40] Again experience I used it the way I
[1:14:41] wanted to
[1:14:44] he was in Jesus in God's thinking
[1:14:49] Adolf Hitler was everybody everybody
[1:14:52] ever come in the world was in God's
[1:14:53] thinking
[1:14:54] but none of those that I named off in
[1:14:57] real life you know doing none of those
[1:14:59] were a part of God
[1:15:01] they were part of God in his thinking
[1:15:03] part not a part of God in his being part
[1:15:07] come on I tried to write down something
[1:15:09] I hope I can get it
[1:15:12] you see why I used it as our thoughts
[1:15:15] our human thoughts we say are our
[1:15:17] thoughts
[1:15:17] Brother Gary you don't have my thoughts
[1:15:21] thank God
[1:15:26] see I can't have his thoughts that's his
[1:15:28] thoughts
[1:15:30] but you admit
[1:15:32] that sometimes as thoughts comes in
[1:15:34] there that you don't want
[1:15:37] is that part of you
[1:15:41] or is it something you thought of
[1:15:44] or is it something Satan placed in you
[1:15:47] is his thoughts
[1:15:50] using that as a carnal comparison or
[1:15:53] understanding to try to think about
[1:15:54] God's thoughts
[1:15:56] God's thoughts are Eternal and he can
[1:15:58] never have another thought
[1:16:00] see we can have all kind of thoughts and
[1:16:02] keep thinking
[1:16:03] but God can only have one thought about
[1:16:05] something
[1:16:06] when he thought about what was going to
[1:16:08] happen in the world and the thing it was
[1:16:10] settled you can never have another he
[1:16:12] could change his mind
[1:16:14] so don't try to deal with him can you
[1:16:15] change his mind
[1:16:17] well now Lord if you'll do so and so
[1:16:18] I'll do so and so you better be careful
[1:16:20] how you're dealing with him
[1:16:24] you better be ready to keep your thought
[1:16:26] at the end of it the point you've
[1:16:27] pledged to him for one thing for sure
[1:16:32] but think about it
[1:16:34] God's thoughts being eternal
[1:16:38] you can never have another thought
[1:16:39] whatsoever
[1:16:43] so Judas could be in his thinking
[1:16:49] but Judas wasn't a part of him
[1:16:55] everybody in the world was in his
[1:16:57] thinking
[1:17:00] of what we would do right there's that
[1:17:02] for knowledge again we've got
[1:17:05] the knowledge of knowing before that
[1:17:07] something will take place
[1:17:14] I don't want to do this what he thinks
[1:17:16] about because he thinks about everybody
[1:17:21] and you know his thoughts about the Rich
[1:17:23] Young Ruler
[1:17:25] ever consider those scriptures
[1:17:28] the Bible says he loved him
[1:17:33] that Rich Young Ruler
[1:17:35] he had great attributes in him
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:43] but yet he hit him where he was nobody
[1:17:45] could hit him and didn't work and he hit
[1:17:47] him in his money
[1:17:52] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:17:54] everybody in the world
[1:17:56] was in God's thinking
[1:17:58] that's why he could write the Lamb's
[1:18:00] Book of Life before the foundational
[1:18:02] world that's why he could write the
[1:18:04] Books it is called in Daniel
[1:18:06] and in the Book of Revelation they're
[1:18:07] called books which is The Book of Life
[1:18:09] which is the book of the The Book of
[1:18:11] Life to cover many things and then the
[1:18:14] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:16] they're books to be at the white Throne
[1:18:18] judgment
[1:18:22] and see
[1:18:25] there's a lot of difference between
[1:18:26] being in God's thoughts
[1:18:30] and being in God that's doing the
[1:18:32] thinking
[1:18:36] does everybody understand what I'm
[1:18:38] saying I'm not asking you to believe it
[1:18:39] I'm asking you do you understand
[1:18:42] there's a lot of difference in something
[1:18:43] you think about and it actually being a
[1:18:46] part of you
[1:18:51] everybody knows I love banana pudding
[1:18:57] but I don't have to have it
[1:19:02] as long as you got something else
[1:19:08] foreign
[1:19:13] what about see it's hard to comprehend
[1:19:16] God's talks that he can never have
[1:19:18] another thought he can never
[1:19:20] never change
[1:19:25] but see I want to be
[1:19:27] inside of that one
[1:19:29] not outside of him thinking about me
[1:19:36] for him to think about me could send me
[1:19:38] to hell
[1:19:40] because he'd know much of us
[1:19:45] but if I have the same
[1:19:47] eternal life
[1:19:48] in me
[1:19:51] this day that he had in him right
[1:19:54] I can never be lost amen
[1:20:01] you see
[1:20:03] eternal life is a whole lot different
[1:20:05] than just
[1:20:07] a good thought but Stan come on brother
[1:20:11] or going to church or being good
[1:20:21] see the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:20:24] we were not up there as little people
[1:20:28] running around in heaven
[1:20:32] and at the same time listen
[1:20:35] at the same time Judas
[1:20:38] was being thought of
[1:20:43] the lamb was being thought of that would
[1:20:45] die for the sins of the world
[1:20:47] that Judas would betray
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:53] it was the same time Judas was there
[1:20:58] John and Peter and those were there too
[1:21:05] and what did Jesus mean when he said
[1:21:07] I had fellowship with thee before the
[1:21:09] world
[1:21:15] when he said to Jeremiah said I knew you
[1:21:17] and ordained you a prophet
[1:21:19] before the world
[1:21:25] what's he talking about
[1:21:28] pre-existence
[1:21:30] I believe in pre-existence of eternal
[1:21:32] life
[1:21:35] that's the only pre-existence I'm
[1:21:36] concerned with
[1:21:42] I've always said
[1:21:44] they come up to me and told me today
[1:21:48] said you wouldn't have held you was born
[1:21:50] to Jones or a Smith or something
[1:21:53] he said
[1:21:55] by you denouncing your name
[1:22:00] and taken the name of Samuel Jones or
[1:22:03] something
[1:22:05] you'd become inheritance to a billion
[1:22:08] dollars
[1:22:13] what would you do
[1:22:16] not change my name
[1:22:21] so you're interested in the money
[1:22:24] you come along and tell me my real name
[1:22:26] wouldn't Dale
[1:22:27] I'll tell you my family adopted me if
[1:22:30] nothing else
[1:22:31] if I wasn't born into the family they
[1:22:33] adopted me and they gave me their name
[1:22:37] and they gave me the Dale nature and all
[1:22:40] which is laughing and talking and going
[1:22:43] and you come to Gillsville and you don't
[1:22:45] even have to look around you can pick
[1:22:46] out my family
[1:22:49] because all of us are done away
[1:22:51] happy
[1:22:55] I wouldn't want to change this to Gail
[1:22:58] I've been a day or too long
[1:23:02] he said well what are you getting at
[1:23:06] what's all in the world got any value to
[1:23:08] it
[1:23:10] I'm not concerned whether or not I was
[1:23:12] up in heaven my concern is what am I
[1:23:14] doing now
[1:23:17] because what I'm doing now is displaying
[1:23:20] what God taught
[1:23:23] back there
[1:23:29] why wouldn't we want to be happy and be
[1:23:30] a Christian
[1:23:34] yeah but brother Dale I'd figure out
[1:23:36] some way where I could get the money see
[1:23:37] that's what I mean say ego
[1:23:44] what good is it
[1:23:50] what do you think about it
[1:23:53] when he dwelt alone did you dwell with
[1:23:56] him
[1:23:59] or in him
[1:24:01] a lot of difference in the statement
[1:24:05] if you dwelt with him you'd be like
[1:24:07] everyone
[1:24:10] dwelled in him there's only one way to
[1:24:12] dwell in him and that's our eternal life
[1:24:17] because he always was eternal
[1:24:23] you just go and think about it and
[1:24:25] listen
[1:24:26] I invite you to we we sat down and
[1:24:28] listened to tapes and we we just put on
[1:24:30] a tape and we run through tapes going
[1:24:33] starting about 19 and 63 and go through
[1:24:36] 63 64 65.
[1:24:40] especially 64 and 65. and notice what
[1:24:44] brother Brown was talking about eternal
[1:24:46] life
[1:24:50] when I listened to bro so and so he said
[1:24:52] always was eternal
[1:25:00] if you always was eternal
[1:25:03] why are you getting old now
[1:25:11] right
[1:25:14] so there must be something else besides
[1:25:16] this ego go ahead 261. anybody have
[1:25:20] anything 261 in the spiral book anybody
[1:25:23] have a need just come in let's believe
[1:25:25] soon this life will all be
[1:25:30] over
[1:25:33] here
[1:25:36] soon we'll take our heaven
