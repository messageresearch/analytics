[3:27] 1 we've been reading this now for quite
[3:30] a while but we just keep kind of adding
[3:32] a few scriptures in to give us
[3:36] understanding says the revelation of
[3:38] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[3:40] show unto his servants things which must
[3:43] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[3:45] signified it by his Angel un to his
[3:48] servant John who by record of the word
[3:51] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[3:53] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[3:57] he that readeth and they that hear the
[3:59] words of this prophecy and keep those
[4:01] things which are written therein for the
[4:04] time is at hand so we believe the time
[4:07] being here right now we go to First
[4:10] Peter
[4:11] um
[4:14] 1:9 receiving the end of your faith even
[4:17] the salvation of your
[4:18] souls of which salvation the prophets
[4:21] have inquired and search diligently who
[4:25] prophesied of the grace that should come
[4:26] unto you searching what are what manner
[4:30] of time the spirit of Christ which was
[4:32] in them to signify when it testified
[4:34] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[4:36] the glory that should be that should
[4:38] follow unto whom it was revealed that
[4:41] not unto them but unto us they did
[4:44] Minister the things which are now
[4:46] reported unto you by them that have
[4:48] preached the gospel unto you with the
[4:50] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[4:53] things the Angels
[4:54] desire desire to look into wherefore G
[4:58] up the loins of your mind be sober and
[5:00] hope to the
[5:02] end for the grace that is to be brought
[5:05] unto you at the
[5:07] revelation of Jesus Christ now we'll go
[5:12] to Luke to just tie end the message may
[5:16] be this afternoon but we'll try to to
[5:18] get into it Luke 1
[5:23] verse
[5:26] 19 now let's read this all together
[5:30] okay everybody
[5:33] ready
[5:34] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[5:39] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[5:43] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[5:47] any means hurt you amen you may be
[5:51] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[5:53] reading of the word we thank you for
[5:56] praying about our shoulder it's a whole
[5:59] lot better I can get my arm on up a
[6:00] little bit sometimes it's kind of rough
[6:03] getting the coat on and off and boy had
[6:06] to come in to help me cuz once you try
[6:08] to get one arm in it do work getting the
[6:10] other one but it's coming it's working
[6:13] out all right I just took a little
[6:15] tumble the other day when during the
[6:17] rain and working and all in a hurry and
[6:20] kind of stretch things out of the place
[6:23] but thank God for the Healer he is that
[6:26] healer now that's right we have been
[6:29] studying in for some while now this is
[6:33] message number
[6:35] 17 and we've been talking about or
[6:38] taking a study on the Book of
[6:41] Revelations leading up to chapter 5
[6:45] which would be the basis of what we were
[6:48] wanting to come to or to see you know to
[6:52] understand so we went through uh those
[6:55] things in Revelations 1 and then going
[6:58] through seeing the the one in the midst
[7:00] of the seven golden Candlestick like
[7:02] under the son of man G about the pouch
[7:04] with a golden girdle and seeing that
[7:06] that was bride form and then we made our
[7:09] statement that we made basically ever
[7:12] service is that if you want to find
[7:14] yourself go in the Book of
[7:17] Revelations because that is the book to
[7:19] find yourself in it is the book
[7:21] personally to you it's your day it's
[7:23] your hour your time is is there to
[7:26] understand the time to understand all
[7:28] right see see then you know as I've
[7:30] always said if I was taking one book and
[7:32] they said you can't have but one book
[7:34] out of the Bible what do you want we're
[7:35] going to isolate you we'll give you the
[7:37] Book of
[7:38] Revelations see since the prophet has
[7:40] come and spoke to us and the symbols are
[7:43] broken and we can understand and read
[7:46] then we don't have any trouble uh being
[7:49] able to comprehend The Book of
[7:51] Revelations you know CU we were trying
[7:53] to figure it out on our own and we
[7:54] couldn't do it and and neither could the
[7:57] prophet of God until God broke it unto
[7:59] him
[8:00] to reveal the word but thank God for uh
[8:03] the prophet coming to bring us the
[8:05] message all right and see then I've told
[8:07] you then that in the Book of Revelations
[8:10] you find in the writings of the Gospel
[8:12] it's writing about Matthew Mark Luke and
[8:14] John it's it's telling about Jesus
[8:16] Christ and what went on on Earth and
[8:18] during the time and things and then the
[8:23] uh Paul Peter James John uh the writers
[8:27] of what we call the New Testament
[8:30] uh then they were writing about their
[8:34] revelation of Jesus Christ and putting
[8:38] that in form to where that we would have
[8:40] it to understand all right then we would
[8:43] find then a vast gap between that period
[8:46] of time and the end time and and we know
[8:49] that God would uh always like a breach
[8:52] comes or gap between something but he
[8:55] has always been gracious to fill in that
[8:57] area to where that we can understand so
[9:01] then he we we looked at it as the first
[9:03] chapter of Revelations filling in the
[9:05] Gap from what the writings of what the
[9:08] apostles were
[9:09] saying and then I told you and I keep
[9:12] telling you to read the book of
[9:15] Revelations and in that book of
[9:17] Revelations you never find Jesus Christ
[9:20] by
[9:21] himself he's always revealing himself
[9:24] either to or right there with but it's
[9:27] basically in the Bride of Jesus Jesus
[9:29] Christ are with the bride of Jesus
[9:31] Christ you know in in in the Book of
[9:34] Revelation so that's a wonderful book to
[9:36] me that's why I love to read it then I
[9:39] can see myself sitting there and and
[9:41] seeing those things and then we we went
[9:44] up as John was to type the Rapture in
[9:48] chapter
[9:50] 4 and seeing the open door and the
[9:53] things that was in Revelations 4 taking
[9:55] it kind of verse by verse to express
[9:58] those things
[10:00] of Revelations 4 and seeing that there
[10:03] was a throne set in heaven and and one
[10:06] set on the throne we went through
[10:08] covering then what the prophet had to
[10:10] say about that throne and how it came
[10:12] into being and and that Throne brother R
[10:15] says was the father's Throne the baptism
[10:18] of the Holy Ghost all right see then it
[10:20] would have to have if it's going to be
[10:22] setting dire is going to have to be a
[10:26] time on Earth that that transpires uh
[10:29] you can read in the seals and the things
[10:31] of six seal there's going to be a
[10:33] tribulation period right the six seal
[10:36] covers that part well you know what
[10:37] there has to be a time on Earth that
[10:39] that will take place you agree see that
[10:42] that that's the point I've been trying
[10:43] to get you to look at that you know see
[10:46] if you can look up there and see a
[10:47] throne and one sitting on the throne and
[10:49] see a
[10:50] Rapture and see the bride already there
[10:53] sitting with him on the on the throne
[10:56] then there must be here on Earth
[10:58] something that has taken place Amen to
[11:01] be able to match that kind of you know
[11:04] like I've always tried to get you to see
[11:06] matching pieces that's why when Martin
[11:08] Luther see when he brought the message
[11:10] of the just shall live by faith then
[11:12] once he brought that message his life
[11:14] would be very short because that he you
[11:17] know that was all he was to bring he
[11:21] wasn't to bring anymore now he preached
[11:23] a lot of things right but that message
[11:25] of the just shall live by faith well
[11:27] here come John Wesley see coming along
[11:30] with
[11:31] sanctification and then when he does
[11:33] then you know he would be shortlived
[11:36] because that would have that was all he
[11:38] had then he come zusa Street with the
[11:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[11:42] being restored and that would be short
[11:45] live because there was not anything else
[11:47] to take place in that time but then in
[11:49] the end time the prophet was to come to
[11:52] bring us to
[11:54] message and see then we've been what 40
[11:57] something years now in the the a lot of
[11:59] us in that amount of time even studying
[12:02] the message that has been brought unto
[12:04] us see then we we've got a vast time
[12:07] here I know the prophet called it a
[12:08] short time because it is that's right
[12:11] see some of the Ages was real long but
[12:13] this one is going to be real short why
[12:15] because it's going to end in a Rapture
[12:17] but now if we can look there and read
[12:20] that and see ourselves dire the sitting
[12:23] on the throne in in heaven and all then
[12:26] we've got to realize that the Throne of
[12:28] God must start in the heart of man by
[12:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and
[12:33] be able to manifest here on Earth to
[12:36] match what's there that's right all
[12:38] right when it does we're going
[12:40] there Luther and them had to go by the
[12:42] grave cuz it was not anymore for them to
[12:44] bring that's right all right see Luther
[12:47] couldn't bring Wesley's message so there
[12:49] was no way you know for him to go on so
[12:51] he had to go by the grave but see you
[12:53] and I are not to go by the
[12:56] grave I believe somebody's going to be
[12:58] changed twinkl ey and why can't I
[13:01] believe that I'm one of them I've been
[13:03] around here a long time and I surely
[13:05] have enjoyed being here but I want to
[13:08] get out of here I want to be changed I
[13:11] want to be here when that takes place
[13:13] you know and and doing that part and
[13:16] even if I miss it then I'll get me a
[13:19] ticket and go to
[13:21] Israel cuz I'll get to see God in action
[13:25] right right but see I don't imp plan
[13:27] missing it but if I do just you just
[13:30] make on brother Dale's gone to Israel
[13:32] because I want to see God in action
[13:34] that's always been my desire my thoughts
[13:37] and all is to see God made manifest
[13:40] among his people all right and now see
[13:43] in this hour we're seeing those things
[13:45] then we got to Revelations
[13:47] 5 all right we took Revelations 4
[13:50] basically verse by
[13:52] verse but then we came over into
[13:54] Revelations 5 and picking up in
[13:58] Revelation
[14:00] 5 and seeing that and let's just read
[14:03] this because we've been through it but
[14:05] let's read it again because I love it go
[14:07] ahead and pull up the the uh quotes that
[14:10] are supposed to be
[14:12] quoted it'll be number two of the number
[14:14] one and number two all right look what
[14:18] brother randam has to say about these
[14:22] things this is taking Revelation CH 5
[14:24] part 2 uh 61618 paragraph 6 79 and 80
[14:29] all right we find out then that this
[14:31] first beginning of the chapter that we
[14:34] find the fifth chapter is just a TI
[14:37] Block it's a diamond hitch in other
[14:40] words tying
[14:42] together it is a word we would use
[14:44] called
[14:46] breach and if you'll go back to the
[14:48] breach you'll find brother random
[14:50] referring basically to chapter
[14:53] 5 in the breach and just read it you
[14:55] know and and then he's telling all of
[14:57] the things that's happening and what
[14:59] will take place all right he said A
[15:02] diamond hit that ties the last part of
[15:03] the church age of the third chapter the
[15:07] fourth chapter tells us what John was
[15:10] taken up into heaven and the fifth
[15:13] chapter watch it is preparing for these
[15:17] now what the fifth chapter is of
[15:20] preparing now we were talking about this
[15:22] in the Bible Study last night and I said
[15:25] like a gap there a breach see there
[15:27] there's many places in the Bible that
[15:30] there's a
[15:31] breach but now breach is it just mean a
[15:34] gap right right all right that's not
[15:37] very valuable unless you're able to get
[15:40] across right I mean you go down and you
[15:43] see a river and it's 100t wide and 20t
[15:46] deep well you don't want to step out and
[15:48] start Treading Water I don't think you
[15:51] know but you need something to get
[15:53] across so you search for a bridge right
[15:56] all right so that's the way God does
[15:58] things
[15:59] he makes a bridge in there and just to
[16:02] cut it short of what we were talking
[16:03] about see then when when it comes up to
[16:06] the sixth chapter of Revelations brother
[16:08] rown covers the The Sixth Seal and the
[16:10] ending of it and when he comes to the
[16:13] seventh
[16:15] seal you'll notice it goes six at the
[16:18] end of chapter 6 and then it goes to 81
[16:22] is the seventh seal and brother around
[16:24] said now this is all we have to go on
[16:27] what the seventh chap chapter so he
[16:30] preached a message about the seventh
[16:32] chapter to build it over see to make a
[16:36] bridge then he could go to chapter to
[16:39] Revelations you know on the seventh seal
[16:42] and start speaking of
[16:43] it then that's what he's saying here now
[16:46] we need something you and I need
[16:47] something to be able to understand so
[16:50] John is writing this to us about us and
[16:55] sending it we need something to be able
[16:57] to understand now here's our problem but
[17:01] brother Dale brother randam has already
[17:03] preached
[17:04] it
[17:06] amen but that don't mean we have it
[17:09] that's right
[17:11] right your computer's got it if that's
[17:14] the way it
[17:16] works it can quote it back to you and
[17:19] everything else even correct the
[17:21] spelling if you need
[17:23] to right but it don't mean it's right
[17:27] you know it don't mean that what I mean
[17:28] it don't mean it's it it's got to be
[17:30] revealed that's right everybody say
[17:33] can't you just look back there and see
[17:35] in 1963 when the Lord came well that's
[17:39] right I agree with you he came to
[17:41] brother R that's
[17:43] right right he came to brother Brown on
[17:49] see then you say well we got it cuz it
[17:51] came that's a good badst Doctrine that's
[17:53] right now I come from there and I know
[17:55] their
[17:55] Doctrine all right the Baptist say I got
[17:58] the hold Holy
[18:00] Ghost because it came on the day of
[18:06] Pentecost are you
[18:08] listening they say they've got it
[18:10] because it came on the day of Pentecost
[18:12] they don't say they've got it because
[18:13] it's an experience in their heart of the
[18:16] same thing of
[18:17] Pentecost they say we got it cuz it come
[18:20] out well is that the way we are in the
[18:24] message brother R said something what I
[18:27] say I'm not saying he's coming brother R
[18:29] said I'm saying he's here well he's here
[18:31] brother R said he was that's good oh
[18:34] yeah but where's he
[18:39] at all right see we I'm just trying to
[18:42] be serious about the situation because
[18:45] we had 40 something years to run around
[18:47] hor and argue with each
[18:49] other right is that what the children of
[18:52] Israel done 40 years round and around
[18:55] one mountain that's right you pretty
[18:58] pretty bad wouldn't
[19:00] it and you can say boy I know that
[19:03] mountain you remember there I sat down
[19:05] yesterday and I Dro that out and I'm
[19:07] know where that tree is that tree is and
[19:09] that heel is and that thing see that's
[19:11] the way we do with the message oh we
[19:13] know all about it but has it been
[19:18] revealed all right now do you understand
[19:20] what I'm saying yes the fifth chapter is
[19:24] a preparing yes all right now we'll read
[19:28] that on further on in a
[19:30] second brother brandom had to have a
[19:33] preparation the seals wasn't opened in
[19:36] 33 right
[19:39] why like I said Wednesday brother R said
[19:42] it took him 30 something years before he
[19:44] could even preach the statue of perfect
[19:47] man now that's what he
[19:50] said well see then you couldn't the
[19:52] seals couldn't break brother around
[19:54] tried to preach the seals in his early
[19:55] ministry right yes and he had white
[19:59] horse rider is the Holy
[20:02] Ghost right come
[20:05] on but see when God opened the seals
[20:08] then he saw where the truth was right
[20:10] all right now in doing that he had to
[20:13] have a foundation or or a preparation or
[20:17] a breach you know something to be able
[20:19] to come across so brother randam is in
[20:22] his studies he's back here in
[20:25] 61 and he's getting ready and he's
[20:28] studying are the opening of the seals
[20:30] that's right amen and as he's doing it a
[20:33] foundation must be there that's why I
[20:35] keep saying it cuz I mean it I'm serious
[20:37] I've always said this people say brother
[20:40] rown was wrong in his early Ministry but
[20:42] right after the seals
[20:44] broke well I want you to come show me
[20:46] that that's right you're quoting what
[20:49] somebody says that don't have one eye
[20:52] and high sense that's what Brother Don
[20:54] rdle used to say I'll quote him he said
[20:57] anybody with one ey in high sense s to
[20:58] know that ain't
[21:00] right but you
[21:03] see church we want to look at something
[21:05] and say we're here well where we
[21:09] at all let's go ahead and pull it back
[21:12] up to where we can read a little bit
[21:14] because it's a preparation the fifth
[21:16] chapter is not a verse by verse we'll
[21:18] read that he said it's a scene yes and
[21:22] you go down to the movie or you go down
[21:24] especially to a
[21:25] play and they open the curtain that's
[21:28] what you call a scene right all right
[21:31] that goes through so much so many actors
[21:34] are on stage and playing out their parts
[21:36] but then you close the curtain right and
[21:39] then you got another scene well I
[21:41] brother around me saying now
[21:44] what if it's a
[21:46] scene then we need to know what the
[21:49] scene is about that's right so look what
[21:51] he says this the Diamond hits to the lik
[21:54] you know the fourth chapter tells what
[21:55] John was taking up into heaven and the
[21:57] fifth chapter is preparing for these
[21:59] where we went through the seven Church
[22:01] ages now
[22:02] what then John's lifted up in the fourth
[22:05] chapter now this is his preparation
[22:09] right and the fifth chapter is just
[22:11] setting a scene for the opening of The
[22:14] Seven
[22:16] Seals no want
[22:19] see at this time he doesn't know what
[22:22] the seals are right come on I wasn't the
[22:25] one that wrote the book and they put it
[22:27] out so we order they ought to read their
[22:29] own book if nothing else everybody El to
[22:31] brother around even when he preached the
[22:33] breach he preached what God in
[22:35] Simplicity and preached the breach he
[22:37] said I do not know what the first seal
[22:39] is oh yeah he knowed all about then he
[22:43] lied I don't have no problem saying that
[22:47] he said he didn't that's when he
[22:48] preached the first seal he said I don't
[22:50] know what the second third fourth F all
[22:53] right that's sensible that's plain
[22:55] language all right but look what he's
[22:57] saying
[22:59] see here he doesn't know about it he
[23:00] doesn't know what it is but he knows
[23:02] this is the
[23:03] preparing you remember when he got over
[23:06] to the Daniel 70 weeks yes he said if we
[23:08] don't get this out of the way
[23:11] yes we won't be able to understand the
[23:13] seals that's right so we had to get it
[23:16] out of the way he had to preach it
[23:17] that's right right well people just go
[23:19] Haywire all about it but in the Daniel
[23:22] 70 weeks he said if you don't understand
[23:23] the Daniel 7 we he said you can't
[23:25] understand the seal amen I didn't write
[23:28] the book that's right I didn't make the
[23:32] quote but I believe
[23:34] it but everybody now they just byass
[23:37] everything oh yeah I know all about the
[23:38] seal that's white horse rider Antichrist
[23:41] you boy we got it straight down amen but
[23:44] clar Lin taught that before brother
[23:46] random ever come along that's right they
[23:49] don't make clar Lin the prophet that's
[23:52] right it made him having one thing right
[23:55] right right but he probably had
[23:57] everything else messed up he still a
[23:59] trinitarian cuz that's what he was back
[24:01] there all right but look what he's
[24:04] saying John's lifted up this is setting
[24:08] a scene for the opening of The Seven
[24:10] Seals just as he did in the first
[24:16] chapter Opening way the way for the
[24:19] church ages first chapter opening away
[24:23] what is the thing in the first chapter
[24:26] there he stands in the seven golden
[24:27] candles
[24:30] he's to look upon as Jasper and sarden
[24:33] stone that's putting chapter one and
[24:36] chapter 4 because chapter four is where
[24:39] you bringing the sard stone in the and
[24:42] get it all right and he's preparing for
[24:44] the those seven Church ages see the
[24:46] chapter one was preparing for the seven
[24:48] Church
[24:50] ages now what's taking place now he's
[24:53] preparing for the opening of those seals
[24:55] of redemption see that's what the fifth
[24:58] chapter is that's the reason I kind of
[25:00] read it and you just take it from there
[25:03] and talk on it and give the other parts
[25:05] of the scripture is because it isn't
[25:07] verse by verse something that's
[25:10] happening
[25:12] read is preparing for something to
[25:17] happen a lot of difference in that right
[25:19] yes come on and if you get to
[25:24] preparation right then you're just
[25:27] you're ready for it then
[25:29] and that's the way it is by the faith or
[25:31] anything
[25:33] else it's a
[25:35] preparation for the opening of the seals
[25:40] oh
[25:41] yeah the opening of this book that we'll
[25:44] read in a
[25:45] minute because chapter 4 doesn't talk
[25:49] about a
[25:50] book talks about a throne one sitting on
[25:52] the throne 24 Elders rainbow round about
[25:55] The Throne Etc but it doesn't we're
[25:58] going to read Revelation 5 in just a
[25:59] minute and then we'll start our point
[26:01] but in Revelations 5 you see one sitting
[26:04] on the throne with a book in his
[26:05] hand all right now we've got to
[26:10] understand that yes the fifth chapter
[26:13] now is going to be our basis to
[26:16] understand
[26:18] amen that's why he said I don't take it
[26:20] this now he explained verse by
[26:24] verse but he said I'm trying to get you
[26:26] to see a scene
[26:30] now the
[26:32] scene is in
[26:35] heaven you remember that was where they
[26:37] messed up and or where brother around
[26:39] even messed up himself and when they
[26:41] asked him about it or he was talking
[26:42] about the fifth chapter and he said that
[26:45] was israelit after the
[26:47] Rapture then he said hold it something
[26:49] went wrong he said you remember that was
[26:51] the question something went wrong he
[26:53] said he said now hold it a minute said
[26:56] you know somebody told him which was a
[26:58] brother erson told him said read your
[27:00] question or your scripture over he said
[27:02] that is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[27:03] already in
[27:05] glory he said you see where I would have
[27:07] missed
[27:08] that huh now if we go up in Revelations
[27:12] 4:1 the prophet said it and not seen to
[27:15] Revelations
[27:18] 19 then the seals evidently must be to
[27:22] Israel right I've preached that for 40
[27:25] something years so I don't have to worry
[27:26] about it
[27:28] the opening of the seals is to you and I
[27:31] amen cuz he he said Abraham I can't
[27:34] withhold anything from you I'm going to
[27:37] show you the beginning and the
[27:39] ending
[27:41] right it can't be withholding it's got
[27:44] to be he's got to give it so we get to
[27:47] Revelation right now come on get in your
[27:49] questions and answers of the seals they
[27:51] ask brother randam does the man of sin
[27:55] sitting in the temple of God showing
[27:56] himself to be God that f bu the first
[27:58] seal he said
[28:00] yes the only question he got on the
[28:03] seals and he answered it with a simple
[28:06] yes because I imagine the man's heart
[28:09] was in his stomach along at that time
[28:11] because all they could do in the opening
[28:13] of the seals and he announced it he said
[28:15] these are to be things about the seals
[28:17] and and they wanted to know questions
[28:19] like should a woman wear panty holes or
[28:22] you know should he wear this or should
[28:23] he wear uh uh things to go to bed you
[28:26] know or some kind or or what about
[28:28] Father Son and Holy Ghost brother Brown
[28:30] don't you think we're to be baptized
[28:31] Father Son and Holy Ghost and don't you
[28:33] think he was brokenhearted after
[28:35] preaching the whole
[28:38] week am now I wasn't the man that made
[28:41] the
[28:42] statement as I was saying a while ago
[28:45] you say brother Brown said it we got it
[28:48] well you know there is a
[28:51] statement he send the questions and
[28:54] answers he says it's gone from you or
[28:57] either s SE
[28:58] he said it's gone from you and there's
[29:02] no way for you to know
[29:05] it now that's what he said read your
[29:08] book if you don't come to my office I'd
[29:10] be glad to run it off for you he said
[29:13] it's gone from you there's no way for
[29:15] you to know it but said something to
[29:18] happen right around the coming of the
[29:21] Lord don't you think Lord to be
[29:23] somewhere around the coming of the
[29:25] Lord now to show you that we're not
[29:29] trying because we're trying to stay
[29:30] we're going to try to stay with the
[29:31] right hand point this morning and not
[29:33] deal with a book now we're going this
[29:35] afternoon if we get
[29:37] there but we find in Revelations
[29:42] 5 one sitting on the
[29:45] throne all right with a book in his
[29:48] right
[29:50] hand all right now I'll get to it this
[29:53] afternoon more because I don't want to
[29:55] spend much time on it this morning but
[29:57] what kind of a book is
[30:00] that it is certainly not a book like we
[30:02] read because this was back before this
[30:04] form of books came into being all right
[30:07] right that's right amen it was Scrolls
[30:10] and things like that right amen all
[30:12] right but really what kind of a book was
[30:16] it the book in the hand of the one
[30:18] sitting on the
[30:19] throne all right go ahead now where I
[30:22] wrote on start here because I was going
[30:24] to dis quote those be number one start
[30:27] here
[30:28] which
[30:31] is e 63 318 the first seal paragraph
[30:36] 12 now as we study this chapter
[30:40] referring different places even to the
[30:42] old and the New Testament lot because
[30:44] the entire
[30:46] book is the revelation of Jesus
[30:51] Christ you said we know that brother
[30:53] Dale why would you want to keep
[30:55] emphasizing that
[30:58] BL
[30:59] it BL
[31:02] it your Prophet kept emphasizing it
[31:05] that's right why can't I right and just
[31:09] say what he says amen see so what is the
[31:13] entire book what is the book in the hand
[31:15] of the one sitting on the
[31:16] throne we'll get this afternoon more on
[31:19] it but what is it it's the book of
[31:22] redemption
[31:24] right you can argue whether it's this or
[31:27] whether it's that but it's the book of
[31:28] redemption it's the book of the
[31:30] revelation of Jesus
[31:32] Christ and like I told them last night
[31:34] if you would follow something the
[31:36] prophet
[31:38] done he cut short on the seventh seal
[31:41] remember and some didn't even know it
[31:44] last night until I mentioned it a lot of
[31:46] people don't know that brother brandom
[31:48] when he
[31:49] preached the original seventh
[31:52] seal that night he went home and got to
[31:56] thinking about it the next next day he
[31:59] got together before they would release
[32:01] any tapes and he preached called the
[32:05] comments and he withheld part of the
[32:08] original seventh
[32:11] seal now I'll show you in the seal book
[32:13] we had him last night brother Jo run it
[32:15] far you need to look at it he put out
[32:19] comments all right those comment stayed
[32:23] until the next year after he died in
[32:27] after 6 I would come out in ' 66 the
[32:30] brandom
[32:31] foundation voted to release the original
[32:34] seventh seal lot of people don't even
[32:36] know
[32:37] that but it's right there in your seal
[32:39] book it even gives you the page number
[32:41] where it starts and
[32:43] stops but see in the original Seven
[32:47] seal you look at it and really there's
[32:49] only two folds that he's even speaking
[32:56] of you read your
[33:00] book but a short time after the any
[33:02] priest of message called Christ is the
[33:04] mystery of God
[33:06] reveal he said if you miss it in the
[33:09] seals he didn't say go back and read
[33:11] them again or hear the text read the
[33:13] book he said read Christ Minster he said
[33:16] if you miss it in the seals come back to
[33:18] this
[33:19] message because in that message he
[33:21] preached a three-fold
[33:24] revelation right
[33:28] and he said it was the seventh seal page
[33:30] 16117 of Christ of mystery all right now
[33:34] you say well what's that got to do what
[33:36] we're talking about now because it's a
[33:37] complete revelation of Jesus
[33:41] Christ so that third fold that everybody
[33:44] thinks is some kind of a great
[33:48] big I don't know what you'd say they
[33:50] think it is because that's the way
[33:52] people's minds
[33:54] are it would have to be something about
[33:57] the Revel of Jesus
[33:59] Christ
[34:01] right because that's all the book
[34:03] reveals right that's all that's in the
[34:07] book amen no Brother D it's a secret
[34:10] mystery yeah I know all about it they
[34:13] make it a great secret mystery right
[34:16] till some of them says that that great
[34:18] secret mystery under that seventh seal
[34:20] is polygamy and they can have all the
[34:23] wives they
[34:25] want I never did understand cuz I never
[34:27] heard him preach that all the women
[34:29] could have all the husband they wanted I
[34:31] never did read that way it were always
[34:33] the men could have all the wives they
[34:38] wanted the great mystery secret
[34:41] is the Little
[34:44] Hen the rooster with a whole lot of
[34:46] little H running around you
[34:50] know well if that's what it is mankind
[34:55] had that a long time ago
[34:58] right that's not what it is it's a
[35:01] revelation of Jesus
[35:04] Christ all right pull up the next one
[35:07] then cuz that's what I want to go to
[35:09] just keep going on
[35:14] down did we finish that
[35:17] one all
[35:19] right the old and the New Testament is
[35:21] revelation of it's God's revelation God
[35:25] revealing himself in the book healing
[35:28] himself through Christ in the book and
[35:29] Christ is the revelation of God he come
[35:31] to reveal God because he and God were
[35:33] the same God was in Christ reconciling
[35:36] the world to himself and otherwise you'd
[35:38] never know just what God was until he
[35:42] revealed himself through Christ that's
[35:44] right now that's your Prophet statement
[35:47] now you know I got this great you going
[35:49] to see him in Christ first that's right
[35:51] I see him in myself then I see him in
[35:53] Christ no no no you're backwards I'm
[35:55] sorry you missed the whole story you
[35:57] you're going to see him in Christ then
[35:58] you can see him in
[35:59] yourself because my Bible says it's
[36:02] Christ in you so Christ had to come
[36:04] first and then be in
[36:06] you
[36:08] right all
[36:11] right it's revealing himself through
[36:13] Christ in the book and Christ is the
[36:14] revelation of God he come to reveal God
[36:16] because he and God were the
[36:18] same God was in Christ reconciling the
[36:20] world to himself and otherwise you'd
[36:22] never know just what God was until he
[36:24] revealed himself through Christ then you
[36:27] can see I used to think now here's your
[36:32] Prophet than about oh that brother he
[36:35] come in there he understood Jesus Christ
[36:37] all the way through his
[36:40] life now he was a prophet bless him and
[36:44] he never was a trinitarian come on come
[36:49] on but look what he said I used to think
[36:53] years ago that maybe God was angry with
[36:55] me but Christ was love
[36:59] me come to find out it's the same person
[37:02] see and Christ is the very Heart Of
[37:07] God so the book is a revelation of Jesus
[37:11] Christ who does it
[37:13] reveal go to number
[37:15] two it's rising the sun paragraph 308
[37:19] 65418 morning he is the one who opened
[37:23] those
[37:25] seals he is those seals
[37:30] for the entire for the whole word of God
[37:33] is Christ and Christ is the seals that
[37:36] was opened what is the opening of the
[37:38] seals then revealing
[37:42] Christ I like that you notice brother R
[37:45] didn't preach Jesus was the mystery of
[37:47] God revealed that's
[37:51] right you missed your title he preached
[37:54] Christ as a mystery of godv
[37:58] I believe it's page 74 Christ of mystery
[38:01] where the bride I've got it in either
[38:02] this afternoon or somewhere he said the
[38:04] bride is part of the Myster
[38:06] amen you know what brother around says
[38:08] God is not complete without
[38:10] you I got those quotes laying on today
[38:13] waiting for a time we've been down to
[38:15] here before yes but
[38:20] listen he is those seals for the word of
[38:23] God is
[38:25] Christ now the word of God is
[38:30] Christ okay brother R said if you read
[38:33] the book and don't see Christ in every
[38:35] verse now he didn't say Jesus he said
[38:37] Christ in every verse he said read it
[38:39] again you missed something that's right
[38:41] so when it says so and so we got so and
[38:43] so and so and so we got so and so and so
[38:44] and so we got so and so and so and an
[38:45] hour later you're still reading so and
[38:47] so we got so and so that's talking about
[38:53] Christ or somewhere in there is a
[38:55] lineage you'll find
[38:58] 14 from here to here 14 from here to
[39:00] here Etc he lays it
[39:03] down listen church then what are we
[39:10] seeing now remember what I
[39:14] said the prophet said the fifth
[39:17] chapter was a
[39:20] preparation for the opening of the seal
[39:23] a
[39:24] foundation setting a stage filling up
[39:26] the gap that we were talking about
[39:28] between here and there bringing it forth
[39:31] and showing Jesus Christ standing there
[39:34] not like a brother parent ten said his
[39:36] people said he stood in in that gap for
[39:38] them well brother R don't stand in that
[39:41] gap for me that's right Jesus Christ
[39:44] stands in that Gap now he used brother
[39:47] Brown amen right he used brother Brown
[39:50] to bring the message but brother around
[39:52] didn't stand in the Gap he can't be
[39:53] Jesus
[39:56] Christ now without him we wouldn't have
[39:58] no way to get over the Gap that's right
[40:00] that's right but just make sure you keep
[40:02] it right he said if you make me Jesus
[40:04] Christ you make me Antichrist that's his
[40:08] words but
[40:10] now we're talking about a foundation a
[40:13] preparation and getting things
[40:15] ready what greater Foundation could
[40:18] there be than the word of
[40:20] God I like what the old colored brother
[40:22] said he said I I'd rather be standing on
[40:26] the word
[40:28] then stand it in
[40:31] heaven he said because the Bible says
[40:35] the word says Heaven and Earth will pass
[40:38] away but the word of God abideth forever
[40:41] so all right now let's get a foundation
[40:43] then that's what I was trying to do
[40:44] Wednesday night and I I didn't couldn't
[40:48] leave it so we just have to stay with
[40:49] that part all right look the next
[40:52] one which is do you now believe 1953 116
[40:59] E8 now the very way that I have faith is
[41:02] God in God is first by his word faith is
[41:07] a revelation right all right so deal
[41:10] with that keep that in your mind in a
[41:11] minute maybe if I don't mention it you
[41:13] you'll hold that coin and if of any
[41:17] Vision or any person would speak
[41:20] anything that was contrary to the
[41:25] word what does he say
[41:28] then don't hear
[41:31] it this is the fundamental Foundation of
[41:35] all God has said into to his church what
[41:38] the word is and every person's Faith
[41:41] must be built sovereignly upon the
[41:45] Bible must be built sovereignty on the
[41:47] Bible the only
[41:49] foundation that we have so how are we're
[41:52] going to get across this from
[41:53] Revelations
[41:55] 4 to Revelations
[42:01] six well I'm back to that again right
[42:04] around and said
[42:05] it but has it been revealed to
[42:09] you that's
[42:11] right what revealed see we're looking
[42:14] for secret
[42:16] Mysteries some canalyzing
[42:19] something
[42:21] right now I just laid the foundation of
[42:23] showing you exactly what I'm talking
[42:25] about that's right amen the seals the
[42:28] entire
[42:29] Bible is a revelation of Jesus
[42:33] Christ so then there must be something
[42:35] about Jesus Christ that we need to know
[42:38] that's
[42:39] right now is it true that brother Bram
[42:42] always preached one true and living
[42:44] God and that Christ was that God
[42:48] yes then why did he preach a message
[42:51] over after the seal was broke
[42:58] and called it Christ as a
[43:00] mystery he must have seen more about
[43:03] Christ
[43:05] right there must have been something
[43:06] about Christ that wasn't being made
[43:08] known just like I read down there he
[43:11] said I used to think that God hated me
[43:14] and Jesus loved
[43:16] me until it was revealed in other
[43:20] words that they're the same
[43:23] person now this your Prophet there with
[43:25] growth development through his his
[43:27] understanding
[43:29] right so what are we trying to
[43:36] do lot of people say well brother all
[43:39] brother Dale is just word word word word
[43:42] word word well what are
[43:47] you what I said I like about what
[43:50] Brother Joseph was to write to him
[43:52] hadn't heard any more about it about the
[43:54] when the man up there said you know the
[43:56] the
[43:57] movie or the people up there in that
[44:00] Kentucky where they were talking about
[44:01] brother brandom and the guy was going
[44:03] through and all the things you've heard
[44:04] about
[44:05] it said did this are they still just
[44:08] yeah they're just listening them same
[44:10] old 1200 term tapes over and
[44:13] over Joseph wrote him back and was least
[44:17] it's been his comments it said we've
[44:19] been reading the same Bible for 2,000
[44:23] years over and over that's a good point
[44:27] you can argue all you want to about
[44:29] anybody just tell them what the word
[44:32] says see a
[44:34] foundation all right look at the next
[44:37] one this is from the message looking for
[44:39] Jesus 54 uh 222 uh 228 excuse me
[44:44] evening E15 now the ministers usually
[44:47] here in it now the ministers usually
[44:51] here is the basis and Foundation of all
[44:54] Christendom it lays right here in the
[45:00] Bible anything outside of that is untrue
[45:03] that's that's right it has to be based
[45:06] on thus sayth the Lord
[45:09] amen what's going to carry us
[45:12] across what's going to fill in any gap
[45:15] for us to
[45:17] understand is going to have to be the
[45:19] word that's right amen amen it can't be
[45:22] our ideas and thoughts they've run the
[45:24] wild field of that and you know it
[45:26] that's right cuz they've had all kind of
[45:27] they saying polygamy they've had all
[45:29] kind I'm the guy to take over I'm
[45:31] supposed to be supposed to be an Indian
[45:32] supposed to be this one supposed to be
[45:34] over here supposed to be over there you
[45:35] got to follow this well you know what
[45:38] God is just letting all that down that's
[45:42] right right that's right he just letting
[45:45] all of them that was running the field
[45:48] just die
[45:51] off cuz it ain't no good when it comes
[45:53] to a battle anyway
[45:58] come on in the natural you don't if we
[46:00] went to war today you think they would
[46:02] take me over there they wouldn't even
[46:04] spend time putting me in an airplane to
[46:06] help them fight and I'm too old and fat
[46:10] I'd be a
[46:12] drudgery well I'm not making fun of a
[46:14] lot of people God showed me years ago
[46:17] there'd be a lot of people in this
[46:18] message die before the Rapture would
[46:20] come and that ain't no new thing said to
[46:22] you
[46:24] right you see them dying off now and
[46:26] just
[46:28] leaving the scene you see it's getting
[46:31] too
[46:32] old I there's one fell here in the
[46:34] United States lives 100 114 years old I
[46:37] think the oldest person well I still got
[46:40] I still got about 44 years 42 years to
[46:43] go then you know so don't just get in
[46:46] your mind play toys with it so be real
[46:49] in what you're doing look at the next
[46:50] one the curtain of time
[46:52] 1955 uh 302 paragraph 47
[46:59] and went ahead and he said he started
[47:01] Jesus never started to argue with them
[47:03] or talking he said watch what he did
[47:08] went straight to the word that's it
[47:11] brother the word of God that's the basis
[47:14] and Foundation of all salvation and
[47:17] healing lays in the word watch you not
[47:20] in your
[47:21] feelings not what you think about it but
[47:25] what God has said about it amen oh I
[47:27] wish I could take a have a tack and I
[47:31] could tack that in your heart where it
[47:33] would never get
[47:35] loose now what could be said any more
[47:37] than that a foundation the foundation of
[47:41] all things the next one number six what
[47:43] is
[47:45] it statue of a perfect man notice you
[47:49] must be born again and when you're born
[47:50] again you can't be born again without
[47:52] having faith that's right so you see my
[47:53] on my chart here I got the very
[47:56] Foundation faith is the foundation of
[47:58] all of it for without faith it's
[48:00] impossible to believe God he that cometh
[48:03] to God must believe that he is in the
[48:04] reward of those that diligently seek him
[48:07] see he must be and when you're a skeptic
[48:10] of the Bible when you're skeptic of the
[48:14] word being
[48:16] right you just might as well stay back
[48:20] until first you
[48:25] believe I think it's about time to
[48:29] believe if it ain't what are we
[48:37] doing what are what are we
[48:41] doing
[48:44] now pull up Revelations 51 and let's get
[48:47] started we'll go for just a little
[48:51] while and I saw in the right hand of him
[48:54] that sat on the throne the book WR
[48:56] within and on the back side seal with
[48:59] Seven
[49:03] Seals
[49:08] now I know I'm hateful sarcastic
[49:12] arrogant I know that I'm
[49:16] sorry but ever since I've been in the
[49:19] message I've heard very few people
[49:21] preaching about the one on the throne
[49:24] the book in his hand
[49:27] they're always trying to figure out that
[49:29] writing on the inside and on the
[49:33] backside now you know that's true
[49:36] right there's been all kind of versions
[49:39] put out of what that meant
[49:43] amen riding on the inside and riding on
[49:47] the outside seal with seven
[49:54] seals instead of getting the foundation
[49:57] of the one on the
[50:00] throne and the book in the hand to be
[50:02] able to
[50:05] understand is trying to figure out
[50:10] something that they know nothing
[50:15] about so a brother gets his idea and he
[50:17] runs with it and then everybody wants to
[50:19] follow after that and then after a while
[50:21] they see that kind of crumble and they
[50:24] float back you know and you see him
[50:27] another one comes up and another young
[50:28] fell gets really anointings and gets to
[50:30] go and everybody wants to run with
[50:34] him you know what I've always told
[50:39] you just let them run that's right don't
[50:42] argue with
[50:43] him cuz they going to run
[50:46] out and settle
[50:49] down because it's like there when Jesus
[50:51] was there and you remember who was it g
[50:54] you said noway a fell rose up over here
[50:57] and let about 400 out you
[51:00] under and said you know after a while it
[51:03] all peted out you know fell
[51:06] away and so I suggest what we do is
[51:09] leave this man
[51:11] alone because if it's not right it's
[51:13] going to be like that that's right right
[51:16] but if it is
[51:17] right we're going to be fighting against
[51:20] God right you had a good point didn't he
[51:23] brother around said because of his stand
[51:26] he would not he is did not never record
[51:28] of him receiving the Holy Ghost him in
[51:30] Nicodemus or G but he said they would be
[51:32] given eternal life because of their
[51:34] stand right there is a good
[51:36] stand let's just leave it
[51:39] alone if it be anything it'll survive
[51:42] but if not it'll come to
[51:44] not well that's what you do with all
[51:46] these doctrines and ideas and thoughts
[51:50] right you
[51:53] know I was curious and I ran in
[51:57] they're on the computer to you see how
[51:59] many times it speaks of right
[52:02] hand cuz that's what we're going to talk
[52:04] about we're not going to talk about the
[52:06] book this afternoon or maybe Wednesday
[52:09] No but uh we're going to talk about the
[52:13] right hand oh we know all about right
[52:15] hand's power well unless some maybe
[52:17] doesn't know that maybe they haven't
[52:19] seen it I'll run it in to see how many
[52:21] times it says right hand in the
[52:25] Bible and and I know what it could be
[52:27] meaning different things in different
[52:28] version whatever and just somebody right
[52:31] hand he took with his right hand and all
[52:33] but right hand is mentioned 6 161
[52:37] times in the
[52:41] Bible what is your Prophet keep
[52:44] emphasizing right
[52:47] hand right
[52:49] hand sure we know it's power and
[52:51] authority
[52:54] right yes but if you ever just went true
[52:56] just a little bit so we'll do this for a
[52:58] minute and then we'll quit go ahead
[53:01] Brothers they got all these scriptures
[53:02] lined up that we can go one after the
[53:05] other and come down they can put them
[53:07] all up at once or one at a time now when
[53:11] Jesus Christ was here on Earth he died
[53:14] and paid the
[53:17] price and where'd he
[53:20] go according
[53:22] to Second
[53:24] Peter this is where Peter said he
[53:28] went who has gone into heaven and is on
[53:32] the right hand of God angels and
[53:34] authorities and Powers being made
[53:37] subject unto
[53:39] him all right do we know where he went
[53:42] to by the Bible get the next
[53:48] one the next one was
[53:52] speaking Hebrews 10 and 12
[53:57] but this man after he had offered one
[53:59] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[54:03] the right hand of
[54:06] God so we know where he went keep on
[54:10] going Hebrews 8
[54:12] And1 now the things which we have spoken
[54:14] this is the
[54:16] sum you know what sum means you're
[54:19] you're getting everything you bring it
[54:20] all together we have such a high priest
[54:23] who is set on the right hand of the
[54:26] throne of the Majesty in the
[54:29] heavens so it's right hand of
[54:32] God right hand of
[54:36] Throne of majesty so it's evident in the
[54:38] same
[54:39] place you follow
[54:42] that look at the next
[54:46] one who being the brightness Hebrews 1
[54:49] and3 of his glory and express image of
[54:52] his person and upholding All Things by
[54:54] the word of his power when he had by
[54:56] himself Pur our sins sat down on the
[55:00] right hand of the Majesty on
[55:04] high all right you connected the hand it
[55:07] has to be then the right hand of God
[55:10] would have to be the right hand of
[55:12] majesty the Throne all
[55:16] right
[55:17] now Colossians 3:
[55:20] 1 if he didn't be risen with Christ seek
[55:23] those things which are above were Christ
[55:26] Christ sth on the right hand of
[55:31] God
[55:33] now on the right hand of God in the
[55:36] original thought that we would bring was
[55:38] when Jesus would resurrect he would sit
[55:39] on the
[55:42] throne now we're calling it The
[55:48] Christ look at mark 16-
[55:55] 19 they saw him go
[55:57] here right so then after the Lord had
[56:01] spoken to them he was received up into
[56:05] heaven and sit on the right hand of God
[56:09] do we know where he went
[56:10] to they saw him go
[56:18] there Jesus referred to this position in
[56:21] Matthew 2664
[56:26] Jesus Sith unto them thou has said
[56:28] nevertheless I say unto you here after
[56:31] shall you see the son of man sitting on
[56:34] the right hand of power and coming in
[56:36] the Clouds Of
[56:41] Heaven it was spoken of according to
[56:45] Mark 12 and
[56:50] 36 where David said by the Holy Ghost
[56:53] the Lord said to my Lord sit down on my
[56:55] right hand hand till I make thine
[56:57] enemies thy foottoo that was David back
[57:00] in the Psalms right prophesying of it
[57:04] stepen actually saw what Jesus
[57:08] said Jesus said you'll see the son of
[57:10] man in at your right hand Steven at his
[57:14] crucifixion acts
[57:16] 75556 but he being full of the Holy
[57:18] Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven
[57:20] and saw the glory of God and Jesus
[57:23] standing on the right hand of God
[57:26] and said behold I see the heavens open
[57:29] and the son of man standing on the right
[57:32] hand of
[57:36] God Steven saw
[57:38] it Paul spoke of it Romans 8 and 34 who
[57:44] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[57:45] died yeah brother that is risen again
[57:48] who is even at the right hand of God who
[57:50] also maketh intercession for
[57:55] us Ephesians 1
[57:57] and
[58:00] 20 which he WR in Christ when he raised
[58:03] him from the dead who did it God raised
[58:07] him and set him at his own right hand in
[58:10] the Heavenly
[58:14] places
[58:16] acts
[58:19] 5:31 Him hath God
[58:21] exalted with his right hand
[58:27] are you reading yes all the others been
[58:30] going to the right hand or on the right
[58:31] hand or
[58:32] whatever how did Jesus get to where he
[58:35] was
[58:36] at him ha God exalted with his right
[58:39] hand to be a prince and savior to give
[58:42] repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
[58:44] sins Acts 2
[58:47] and33 therefore being by the right hand
[58:50] of God
[58:52] exalted in having received of the Father
[58:55] the promise of the Holy Ghost
[58:57] he has shed forth this which he now see
[58:59] and
[59:01] hear are you
[59:04] listening
[59:06] Hebrews 12 and 2 looking under Jesus the
[59:10] author and finisher of our faith who far
[59:11] the joy that was set before him endured
[59:14] the cross despising the shame and is sat
[59:17] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[59:20] God there's a lot more in it if you want
[59:23] to read just run in right hand
[59:30] but you
[59:31] see we want to look at right hand as
[59:34] being will yeah he was sitting on the
[59:35] right hand now you know what that was
[59:37] with all of us before we heard the
[59:39] message right God had a great big old
[59:42] hand and Jesus was sitting on it so we
[59:45] got the Trinity father's on the throne
[59:48] and Jesus is sitting on his hands and
[59:50] the Holy Ghost is down here in the
[59:52] church upon Earth so we got a good
[59:55] Trinity
[1:00:00] right well now we might have had it a
[1:00:02] little different version right you know
[1:00:06] you know what I'm saying we might not
[1:00:08] have thought that but as I told you when
[1:00:11] brother Mo asked me what I believed
[1:00:12] about God I said that Baptist Doctrine
[1:00:14] see as one true and living God that's
[1:00:17] their basis but to explain it he said
[1:00:20] now explain it I said God in three
[1:00:23] persons Blessed Trinity
[1:00:27] he said you Trinity just like the rest
[1:00:29] of
[1:00:30] them boy I didn't get mad stomp out Feud
[1:00:33] and wouldn't talk to him no more I said
[1:00:36] would you explain yourself
[1:00:38] sir he said person to personality
[1:00:42] personality is an individual individual
[1:00:44] is a
[1:00:45] person so now if you got them three
[1:00:48] persons you're just as Trinity as
[1:00:49] anybody
[1:00:50] else I've told you before it didn't take
[1:00:53] me No 5 minutes it didn't take no
[1:00:56] nothing I looked at him and I said I
[1:00:57] don't believe that no
[1:01:00] more that's what I said cuz I didn't why
[1:01:03] because he done nail my hide to the wall
[1:01:05] there was nowhere I could go I had
[1:01:08] enough sense to know that I could have
[1:01:10] quoted the father son Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost no I knew better do that CU I
[1:01:16] talking to a man that could quote faster
[1:01:18] than I
[1:01:19] could and I was glad of it that man knew
[1:01:22] 3/4 of the Bible by memory
[1:01:26] and I'd always go when I'd be looking
[1:01:27] for scripture I just go over and say
[1:01:28] brother Mo where the scripture says so
[1:01:30] and so and so and so he just rattled it
[1:01:33] off but you see we think we're
[1:01:37] smart you can't prove me there ain't no
[1:01:40] Trinity I get to heaven if they ain't
[1:01:43] three Thrones and three Gods I'll leave
[1:01:46] you ain't never heard that
[1:01:49] one that's what people say
[1:01:54] right all right this for a second maybe
[1:01:57] we can bring this message to part of a
[1:02:00] close
[1:02:02] anyway what is the right
[1:02:05] hand I can give you the quotes go ahead
[1:02:07] and pull it up that can read it brother
[1:02:09] Joe and brother Anderson and you know
[1:02:13] you can read some of it but you ought to
[1:02:15] know these quotes by
[1:02:17] heart the right hand is not that God is
[1:02:22] got a big old right
[1:02:23] hand right
[1:02:27] and it's not one person sitting here
[1:02:29] another person sitting here cuz we
[1:02:30] already went to it there Wednesday
[1:02:33] night last Sunday that brother R said he
[1:02:37] come and took the book climbed up on the
[1:02:39] throne and sat
[1:02:42] down well now you got the father on the
[1:02:44] throne and the son on the
[1:02:47] throne if you got two
[1:02:50] persons but if you got one you got the
[1:02:52] opening of the word revealing of one
[1:02:55] true Living
[1:02:56] God all right so then what we do we look
[1:03:00] at it he said his right hand means power
[1:03:03] he says for instance like if you know if
[1:03:06] they had full sway of the church and
[1:03:08] brother Neville will come along you know
[1:03:10] and he'd hand it over to him in other
[1:03:11] words and know he said he's my right
[1:03:14] hand we talk about the right hand that's
[1:03:17] reason I gave you we sitting on the
[1:03:18] right hand but he was exalted by the
[1:03:20] right
[1:03:22] hand see right hand means power and
[1:03:24] authority h amen go ahead to the next
[1:03:27] one I won't read them so you can just go
[1:03:28] down through there and read them off you
[1:03:33] set right hand not God has a right hand
[1:03:37] that somebody's sitting on right hand
[1:03:39] means power and
[1:03:41] authority got the authority of
[1:03:43] everything in heaven and in Earth you
[1:03:45] remember that after his resurrection we
[1:03:48] get to it this
[1:03:51] afternoon he said all power is given
[1:03:54] unto me in heaven and earth her right
[1:03:57] you know what brother said about that he
[1:03:59] said if that be true and he's wri in his
[1:04:01] statement he said then if you got
[1:04:02] another God he ain't got no power I love
[1:04:05] the way he just talk plain you know you
[1:04:07] can't argue that point a theologian he
[1:04:10] can fuss and scream and holler of the
[1:04:11] quotes but he can't argue a simple
[1:04:13] little
[1:04:14] point he ain't got sense enough to
[1:04:16] become
[1:04:18] simple the prophet said then your God is
[1:04:21] powerless cuz Jesus said all power is
[1:04:23] given unto me
[1:04:27] amen and you know he never said that
[1:04:29] until after his death bur and
[1:04:34] Resurrection right
[1:04:37] right you didn't say it when he was here
[1:04:39] in
[1:04:43] life right hand means
[1:04:46] power I'll just cut off a lot of this
[1:04:48] and come right back to the
[1:04:50] point right hand means power and
[1:04:52] authority
[1:04:56] so then if you
[1:04:59] got Jesus having power and God having
[1:05:04] power now while Jesus would here alive
[1:05:07] on Earth there was things he didn't
[1:05:10] know you agree do you need these quotes
[1:05:15] brother said he didn't know his future
[1:05:17] work in the church until after his death
[1:05:19] bur and Resurrection come to John on
[1:05:20] patas all right you need these quotes be
[1:05:22] glad to
[1:05:23] again but see Jesus then didn't have all
[1:05:26] power when he was on
[1:05:29] earth right I'm talking about Force
[1:05:31] death bural and
[1:05:33] Resurrection you said well you better
[1:05:36] paddle in a
[1:05:37] hurry you're caught no I ain't
[1:05:40] caught I love it in deep
[1:05:45] water see because Jesus said I do
[1:05:47] nothing until my father shows me
[1:05:53] that's right amen
[1:05:56] so you going to paddle back out yourself
[1:05:58] now cuz I'm out of the water stand
[1:05:59] waiting on
[1:06:00] you I don't mean that sarcastically I
[1:06:02] just mean it's a
[1:06:04] truth see people think they're smart in
[1:06:06] the word but do just don't get caught in
[1:06:08] the word maybe I'm just a good old
[1:06:10] Baptist but you know what brother Brown
[1:06:12] said about him he said that good old
[1:06:15] Baptist will tear you apart with the
[1:06:19] word he says you better know what you're
[1:06:21] talking
[1:06:22] about see because we read the Bible
[1:06:25] didn't read everything
[1:06:27] else all maybe that's all I am
[1:06:31] today what are
[1:06:34] you
[1:06:37] see so Jesus when he was here on Earth
[1:06:40] and
[1:06:43] watch the power and
[1:06:47] authority he had the authority invested
[1:06:50] of him of the father
[1:06:52] right now you agree with that I mean had
[1:06:55] to power invested to it yes all right
[1:06:59] didn't know everything didn't you
[1:07:03] know but you know what while he was
[1:07:06] here that's where we read in Luke there
[1:07:09] when we
[1:07:10] started he said I give you
[1:07:14] power
[1:07:17] over serpents Etc and even the power of
[1:07:22] the enemy
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:31] right you see he said and I can show you
[1:07:33] the quotes where he said there's where
[1:07:34] the church fails because they don't
[1:07:36] believe
[1:07:39] that they don't believe that they have
[1:07:45] power remember is what he gives us we
[1:07:47] don't have any power of our own that's
[1:07:49] where we tried to work that up and make
[1:07:51] it work and it don't do it it's what he
[1:07:53] gives us
[1:07:55] Jesus never credited power of his own
[1:07:58] that's right he credited power of the
[1:08:02] father but you see when he received all
[1:08:06] the
[1:08:09] power then where's his power now
[1:08:16] right let lay here if you'd like to read
[1:08:19] them where brother around and said you
[1:08:20] see there were those stars in his right
[1:08:22] hand he said those were the messengers
[1:08:24] of the age he said they were the voice
[1:08:26] and power of
[1:08:28] God well if they're there then we're
[1:08:31] there right why can't you see what we
[1:08:34] are church I believe it if all power in
[1:08:37] Heaven and Earth was given unto him and
[1:08:38] he gave us that same power according to
[1:08:41] my Bible that I
[1:08:45] read I read where it says that we're
[1:08:49] co-equal with
[1:08:52] him what the Bible say
[1:08:56] Co equal that's right so whatever he has
[1:08:58] I
[1:09:00] have
[1:09:02] right I told him at work one day down
[1:09:04] there I said my father runs a cattle on
[1:09:06] a thousand heill and said if he was
[1:09:08] hungry he wouldn't ask you for anything
[1:09:10] to eat there's a boy he come here he
[1:09:13] called his gu said tell him about your
[1:09:18] father that's my
[1:09:21] father but you see we just don't believe
[1:09:23] it
[1:09:27] we read it but we don't believe
[1:09:30] it now I'm trying to illustrate so you
[1:09:33] remember where that we were talking a
[1:09:35] while ago that everybody thinks brother
[1:09:37] Brandon said it and I got
[1:09:40] it well you know he said that every Born
[1:09:43] Again
[1:09:44] believer taking the word of God upon his
[1:09:47] lips was deity speaking amen believe yes
[1:09:53] do you believe that yes amen like we was
[1:09:56] talking about the other week there about
[1:09:58] the everybody wants to make the combat
[1:10:00] Beast they say the man you know the lon
[1:10:02] the ox the man all that was God in the
[1:10:05] people but when it come to the lights
[1:10:07] when the Eagles brother random brother
[1:10:09] random all by
[1:10:10] yourself and then we got an eagle age
[1:10:12] out here that everybody's even Sinners
[1:10:14] put Eagles on their houses and their
[1:10:16] thing you go in a store to to buy
[1:10:18] something go in a novelty store and you
[1:10:19] see Eagles all over the
[1:10:21] place
[1:10:23] right brother random said
[1:10:26] when the Eagles plural
[1:10:29] come you need that quote he said when
[1:10:32] the Eagles plural
[1:10:35] appear I thought we believe we little
[1:10:37] eets right I thought we believe we were
[1:10:40] little
[1:10:43] Messiah but do we believe that God has
[1:10:46] made us remember the Bible said it is he
[1:10:49] that has made us not we ourselves we are
[1:10:50] his people
[1:10:52] she so it's what he's made us he said I
[1:10:55] give you all
[1:10:57] power over every
[1:11:03] enemy the Bible said there's no weapon
[1:11:09] formed that can conquer
[1:11:15] you Ain can drop a bomb right in this
[1:11:21] building it can explode and not hurt a
[1:11:24] one in here that's right that's right
[1:11:29] that's amen but see do we believe
[1:11:32] that now that's what we're scared of
[1:11:36] we're afraid to step
[1:11:41] out of course then comes up the thing
[1:11:45] see but brother
[1:11:50] Dale we don't see much going on at L

[1:11:55] talking about that's our

[1:12:00] else right what it goes on everywhere
[1:12:02] else no business of mine we're

[1:15:13] same God that brother R Ser to heal us
[1:15:17] and Deliver Us and save
[1:15:21] us see the bride now is the power of God
[1:15:23] on Earth that's right yes where do we
[1:15:26] get into where that lamb comes from cuz
[1:15:29] it's got seven horns and seven eyes but
[1:15:32] the r said it comes from the church ages
[1:15:34] that's
[1:15:38] right right hand is power and
[1:15:42] authority and God has given us that
[1:15:46] yes take up deadly
[1:15:51] serpents drank deadly things
[1:15:59] sister
[1:16:01] up north up there just walked by one day
[1:16:05] where there was like a smoke was coming
[1:16:09] out and you know it just went into her
[1:16:11] lungs and just ru
[1:16:14] them I don't know where she's still
[1:16:16] alive I don't really
[1:16:22] know do you don't know the water you
[1:16:24] drink
[1:16:25] the air you breathe the things you
[1:16:29] better be
[1:16:31] praying because everything what about
[1:16:33] that girl the other day that what what
[1:16:35] did she do was a simple thing and she
[1:16:38] wound up with the disease that just her
[1:16:40] body is just they had to take parts off
[1:16:42] because it just
[1:16:45] started right run around and see it
[1:16:48] it'll come a time the cancer would just
[1:16:49] be like a toothache that's right amen
[1:16:55] do we better be under the blood folks
[1:16:58] and believe in
[1:17:01] it but would it offend you if I made
[1:17:04] this life
[1:17:07] statement if what I said is true then
[1:17:11] and Jesus said all power in Heaven and
[1:17:13] Earth is given unto
[1:17:15] me and that we're
[1:17:18] co-equal that whatever he has I have
[1:17:22] right then to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:26] Christ all the powers in Heaven and
[1:17:28] Earth is at your disposal that's
[1:17:32] right you know I remember when I was in
[1:17:34] school that they you know we had used to
[1:17:37] have grain Ries filled up with with the
[1:17:39] grain and everything enough to feed our
[1:17:42] Nations for years and years and years
[1:17:45] and you know one Ambassador went to
[1:17:47] Russia and gave it to
[1:17:50] him you know they had to keep his word
[1:17:52] cuz he was an ambassador
[1:17:56] we send an ambassador to one of these
[1:17:58] countries and they go over there and say
[1:18:00] it we got to do it because that full
[1:18:03] authority of the United States is behind
[1:18:04] that
[1:18:08] Ambassador all Heaven is behind us got a
[1:18:11] quote in here where brother said it's
[1:18:13] behind
[1:18:15] us backing us up we're ambassadors for
[1:18:18] Jesus Christ let's stand come on
[1:18:20] musician think on these things
[1:18:26] power and
[1:18:29] authority the right
[1:18:34] hand right hand of
[1:18:37] God the Bible says we're saved by his
[1:18:40] right
[1:18:41] hand exalted by his right
[1:18:45] hand all his power and authority given
[1:18:48] unto you and I but are we afraid to step
[1:18:51] out on
[1:18:54] are we afraid to just say it and believe
[1:18:57] it you know what we do well I I don't
[1:19:00] want to say that I'm Healed when I'm
[1:19:02] really still sick I'd be lying you ain't
[1:19:05] nothing but a born
[1:19:06] liar my Bible says I'm Healed yes
[1:19:11] amen you mean I can't say what God says
[1:19:15] he says I'm
[1:19:18] Healed but see we say but but no I don't
[1:19:21] want to
[1:19:22] say if if this growth go away I'll go
[1:19:25] tell everybody it ain't going to go away
[1:19:28] you better go have it operated
[1:19:32] on CU it ain't going to go away with
[1:19:35] that
[1:19:37] attitude but if you look right straight
[1:19:39] at it
[1:19:42] life when that doctor said I'll take
[1:19:44] your kneecap off I looked at him and
[1:19:47] laughed said you ain't going to take my
[1:19:49] kneecap off he looked back and he
[1:19:51] laughed I loved it he was a good old man
[1:19:53] come in there this is a special is this
[1:19:55] wasn't this regular doctor he come in
[1:19:56] there with old paint all over him he I
[1:19:58] reckon he' been out painting and doing
[1:20:00] something he had paint on his shoe I
[1:20:01] looked at him I said hey you're the kind
[1:20:03] of doctor I like you know he just
[1:20:06] laughed he said I'll take them off Sam I
[1:20:08] said you won't do
[1:20:12] it see why can't we just stand on God's
[1:20:15] word go ahead brother 592 in spiral yes
[1:20:19] 592 in the spir book anybody have a name
[1:20:22] yes let's talk about
[1:20:26] Jesus the King of Kings
[1:20:30] is the
[1:20:36] of anybody have

[1:20:49] lifeus more and
[1:21:03] brother's got a hurt in his
[1:21:06] knees he's ever had
[1:21:09] one so let's just pray and
[1:21:13] believe and just accept What God
[1:21:16] Says now God says he's
[1:21:20] healed so we say he
[1:21:25] so now think about it if he was standing
[1:21:30] here what would he
[1:21:34] do what did he do when he's here he lay
[1:21:37] hands on pray for
[1:21:39] the now what's the
[1:21:46] difference I say he's greater here than
[1:21:48] he was
[1:21:50] there because he's got to put up with
[1:21:52] all the stuff that's around us
[1:21:55] right so let's believe father we condemn
[1:22:00] this this of our brother's
[1:22:05] need we had these pains and things we
[1:22:08] sympathized with but that w't
[1:22:11] healing but faith in a living
[1:22:14] God will change all
[1:22:17] things so now we just lay hands
[1:22:20] on just likeing heart
[1:22:27] Jus anybody
