[0:00] good to see everybody in the house of
[0:02] the Lord
[0:03] it was going to take a minute before the
[0:05] Sunday school class would be coming up
[0:07] and just hey that we had a real good
[0:10] time on our fishing trip and Father's
[0:13] Day and we say to all the fathers Happy
[0:14] Father's Day to you and we had a real
[0:17] good time all the fellowshipping
[0:19] together and playing and doing and
[0:22] everything you know and all and we we uh
[0:25] didn't get catch any fish because they
[0:27] didn't come and stop the thing which is
[0:29] a normal routine for them but they just
[0:32] didn't do it this time but we had enough
[0:34] so we we always take enough with us and
[0:37] everything but you know we do that but I
[0:41] was hoping that they would most of the
[0:43] Sunday school class would be up but we
[0:46] we've got a picture of one of the
[0:50] well the brothers caught up
[0:52] a world record
[0:56] we were wanting to show it to you as the
[1:00] record that the brother caught
[1:04] up
[1:08] oh my goodness you can see he's happy
[1:10] without it that was that was cooked you
[1:13] know I mean the head was taken off you
[1:16] know but it was uh just leave it up
[1:18] there as people are coming up and they
[1:21] can see that he did have a good doing
[1:24] but you can see we have good food too we
[1:26] do we we have some of the greatest Cooks
[1:28] around that the brothers can do and you
[1:31] know Zach will cook breakfast and
[1:33] waiting then we'll cook this one and
[1:34] that and Robbie take care of this and we
[1:37] have a lot of good times together and we
[1:39] appreciate the opportunity to be there
[1:41] together and doing that in in the Lord
[1:44] and we also have a little uh thing that
[1:47] brother Joe has run off that they called
[1:50] us about it the other day and it's in a
[1:52] paper down at Oakwood I think but they
[1:56] wanted to put in the paper kind of the
[1:58] the things you know to show uh some
[2:01] things of Father's Day around this area
[2:04] so they did put us in our uh you know in
[2:07] their Doom engine brother Joe has a copy
[2:09] of it but we just we appreciate that and
[2:13] appreciate all of the the fixings and
[2:15] the doings and some of you made cookies
[2:17] and slaw and stuff like that for us you
[2:21] know and and we we certainly didn't go
[2:23] hungry we had to do and appreciate
[2:27] Brother Gary Krantz having that big old
[2:29] tent because
[2:30] when the downpour came we we had to all
[2:33] get inside and sit down and we actually
[2:35] ate inside and of course I think Zach
[2:38] and Robbie had to cook our hot dogs
[2:40] outside you know in the rain but we did
[2:44] have a good time in it and very safe no
[2:47] problems kids had a good time playing
[2:49] and and we always appreciate each and
[2:51] every one of us so you that are coming
[2:53] on up and you can see that brother Tom
[2:56] caught the largest
[3:00] men are a fish that we did and we did
[3:05] find out something else that there is an
[3:07] old saying you know that smoke follows
[3:10] certain people
[3:12] well we did find that to be true because
[3:14] uh every word brother Chad would move
[3:17] the smoke would go his way so now you
[3:20] put on the other whether it's beautiful
[3:23] or
[3:24] ugliness which one it followers I think
[3:27] it was the red hair yeah myself I think
[3:30] that was what caused him to be able to
[3:32] get all of this smoke together but we
[3:35] got a baby dedication this morning
[3:36] before brother Tom comes out so if the
[3:39] Hamptons family will bring up the little
[3:41] one and we appreciate them being with us
[3:44] today and maybe some of them haven't
[3:46] been here I don't think that there's any
[3:48] other that hadn't been here before but
[3:50] you know we we certainly appreciate them
[3:52] and uh and all and uh
[3:57] I did I have baptized a few of these and
[4:00] my brother sent me words said you
[4:02] baptized me and dedicated me and said I
[4:04] want you to dedicate my baby so we'll
[4:06] just do that this morning and we just
[4:09] appreciate the Lord so let's just sing
[4:10] that bring them
[4:14] bring them in
[4:17] bring the little ones to Jesus
[4:22] bring them in bring them in all the
[4:27] Hamptons family all come together around
[4:29] and listen
[4:31] dedicate the little baby
[4:34] as we always say
[4:37] when we dedicate a baby
[4:39] you know it's something you turn them
[4:40] over to the Lord you give them to
[4:42] someone
[4:43] but you know
[4:44] everybody
[4:46] that Witnesses this whether it be
[4:49] parents you know grandparents or
[4:51] whatever
[4:53] everybody then is dedicating their sales
[4:56] that's the point of their dedication we
[4:58] say well we're just dedicating a baby
[5:00] now the whole family is dedicating
[5:02] themselves to the Lord to live in front
[5:05] of this child
[5:06] to give it an example
[5:08] that the Lord could be with it and help
[5:11] it and all like that so it's really our
[5:13] dedication and all of the church will
[5:15] stand together and we all together hear
[5:17] you and I we've seen many dedications
[5:20] and we just stand in honor of those and
[5:23] we dedicate unto the Lord you know these
[5:26] little children the prophet of God said
[5:28] get them to the Lord quick as possible
[5:30] you know because that way you can get
[5:32] the blessings of the Lord being with
[5:34] them and and being on them and and
[5:36] taking care of them so I hope I get the
[5:39] name right it's Nivia
[5:42] Nevaeh okay I put the lines under it but
[5:46] her name is Nevaeh Grace
[5:48] hantus that we appreciate people
[5:51] thinking enough of us to bring them and
[5:54] let us dedicate the baby
[5:59] thank you
[6:03] company
[6:07] everything will be off
[6:11] let's just all pray together dedicate
[6:13] this into it father
[6:15] we dedicate this from the baby Lord unto
[6:17] you
[6:19] because you put it into the world for us
[6:21] to raise
[6:22] and we maybe not be related to it but
[6:25] yet we are to be an example before that
[6:28] it can see you and want to follow you
[6:31] and then we dedicate it to you Lord
[6:34] because they brought the baby into us to
[6:37] be able to give the little one back to
[6:39] you that gave it up father now we take
[6:43] the little baby and ask you this then we
[6:45] turn it back to the family
[6:47] we say Lord that you would be with them
[6:50] as they ready to go to them
[7:14] that we certainly do appreciate it
[7:16] certainly appreciate them honoring us
[7:18] enough to bring them I think it's my
[7:20] question is that his name he said that
[7:22] you dedicated me to the Lord and
[7:24] baptized me said now I want him to
[7:25] dedicate my baby to the Lord so we
[7:27] appreciate it amen are you ready for the
[7:30] word brother Tom Ernest is going to
[7:32] minister unto us this morning and then
[7:35] they're leaving out right after the
[7:37] service and going down into Florida so
[7:40] remember them as they're traveling and
[7:42] all that the Lord would bless them and
[7:43] take care of them let's stand together

[10:22] you a you know it's just amazing to me

[10:37] we are
[10:38] yeah let's see there's a lot of
[10:40] propaganda involved in this picture
[10:44] the rumor is going to go out that I
[10:46] actually caught that fish but I did see
[10:49] well I'm not going to say where it came
[10:51] from

[11:15] very much for that you know
[11:18] we took I took hours I could have loaned
[11:20] them picked pictures other than that but
[11:22] I don't know
[11:24] I don't know
[11:25] it's called propaganda propaganda
[11:30] the Lord blessed you all this morning it
[11:31] was a it was I just want to say for us
[11:34] getting to come and
[11:36] you guys letting us come and and each
[11:39] one of you getting to know you better
[11:40] that was you brothers that were there
[11:42] just having time to sit around the fire
[11:44] and
[11:45] and hear some of your stories and taking
[11:48] time to analyze which ones were true and
[11:50] which ones were fabricated
[11:53] we're gonna have to sort that out for
[11:55] days to come I am sure
[11:57] in our own hearts and Minds which of you
[11:59] were
[12:01] exaggerating who exaggerates in this
[12:03] building anybody no no you know there
[12:07] was a man one time I don't know if y'all
[12:09] ever it used to be in a little book it
[12:10] was written by
[12:12] a man named Ernie fannler how many you
[12:14] know ever saw that little book he lived
[12:16] up in Minnesota and he actually was
[12:18] around brother Branham quite a bit
[12:20] and of course brother Brandon would get
[12:22] excited and he'd get under the anointing
[12:24] when he was preaching and Goliath had 14
[12:26] inch fingers and there was exaggerations
[12:28] that to get points across well people
[12:31] are critical of that these days you know
[12:34] they expected brother Brandon to be able
[12:36] to tell every story exactly the same way
[12:38] every time and
[12:40] but anyway this brother early fandler
[12:42] was riding in the truck with him he
[12:44] tells this story and and
[12:46] as they're riding along brother Branham
[12:48] kept asking him don't you have something
[12:49] you would like to ask me brother Ernie
[12:51] and he was like no I'm good I got
[12:54] nothing and so they ride a while longer
[12:56] and
[12:57] brother random asked him again don't you
[12:58] have something you would like to ask me
[13:00] and he's no I'm fine I got no no
[13:02] questions well finally after the third
[13:05] time he says all right I'm just going to
[13:06] ask you then do you ever exaggerate
[13:12] did you understand why we'd be a little
[13:14] hesitant to ask that but brother Branham
[13:16] do you ever exaggerate
[13:19] and oh this is gonna shake your faith
[13:21] I'm sure but he's sure brother Ernie who
[13:23] doesn't exaggerate a little bit every
[13:25] once in a while
[13:27] that uh that is uh
[13:29] no that that was very very small fish
[13:32] but
[13:34] all right thank you Brothers again for
[13:36] having us I know for brother Chad and
[13:39] and
[13:40] his family there they
[13:43] they had had a wonderful time until we
[13:46] had a visit with brother Terence last
[13:48] night and the county went downhill from
[13:49] there so
[13:51] you know they had a really nice feel
[13:54] about Georgia until that happened and
[13:56] now
[13:56] now that that's behind us I'm gonna have
[13:58] to renew their faith in coming back ever
[14:01] again but I will I will work on that to
[14:03] get you all some more visitors again
[14:05] from Kansas but
[14:08] Happy Father's Day to all the fathers
[14:10] out there I I don't really have a
[14:12] particular Father's Day message I was in
[14:14] Bartlesville on Mother's Day so just uh
[14:17] back when Mother's Day in May so
[14:19] we've certainly all been remembering
[14:21] brother Claude
[14:22] living so close I get to go down and
[14:25] fill in for him when he's not feeling
[14:26] well and so we've had a really large
[14:29] amount of fellowship with the church
[14:31] there and I appreciate that they're a
[14:32] good Bunch you know they love the word
[14:34] and we're thankful for them so
[14:37] but again to all of you that made the
[14:39] trip as as wonderful as it was you know
[14:41] I don't know why you Georgia people when
[14:44] something goes wrong you blame the
[14:45] visitors I don't understand that the
[14:48] little fish
[14:49] it was like we've been here four years
[14:51] and it never has rained before you know
[14:54] I mean you know there was even talk of
[14:56] if we didn't catch any more fish maybe
[14:58] cannibalism was set in so they were they
[15:00] were debating on who to eat first you
[15:02] know it came down to Kansas people I
[15:05] don't know why they
[15:08] yeah it's a rough crowd y'all got around
[15:10] here that's all I wanted to say about
[15:11] that but but I want to thank you it was
[15:14] a truly truly wonderful time let's read
[15:17] our you can stand together we'll read
[15:18] our scriptures and we'll let you settle
[15:19] down
[15:20] we're going to read in Revelations
[15:21] chapter 2.
[15:25] I enjoyed Wednesday night that was a
[15:28] true I was glad we got in and got to sit
[15:30] I enjoyed that and I told our brother
[15:32] here what a wonderful job he did
[15:34] on that and so
[15:37] if my notes aren't going well I'm just
[15:38] gonna pick his up and keep on from where
[15:40] he was at right up there on the board
[15:42] because that was really really well done
[15:45] and we're going to read the the message
[15:47] to the pertamian church age if you pick
[15:49] it up in Revelations chapter 2
[15:52] and verse 12. I did a little bit of
[15:55] these thoughts back in Wichita just
[15:57] before
[15:58] we came so if you see the abbots dozing
[16:00] off then that's because they've already
[16:02] heard parts of this before so y'all poke
[16:04] them or whatever you do here in Georgia
[16:07] to wake them up Terence what do you all
[16:09] do when people fall asleep huh I know
[16:12] what normal deacons do but I wonder what
[16:13] you do
[16:16] just checking so just so we're prepared
[16:21] all right Revelations chapter two Lord's
[16:23] good to us any verse 12 and to the angel
[16:26] of the church in pergame is right
[16:29] these things saith he which hath the
[16:32] sharp sword with two edges I know I Know
[16:34] Thy works
[16:36] and where thou dwellest even where
[16:38] Satan's seed is and thou hold as fast my
[16:41] name and has not denied my faith even in
[16:44] those days where an Antipas was my
[16:46] faithful martyr
[16:47] who was slain among you where Satan
[16:50] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[16:52] you because thou Hast there them that
[16:55] hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught
[16:57] balak to cast a stumbling block before
[16:59] the children of Israel to eat things
[17:01] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[17:03] fornication so so hast thou also them
[17:06] that hold the doctrine of the
[17:07] Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or
[17:10] else I will come unto thee quickly
[17:12] and we'll fight against them with the
[17:14] sword of my mouth he that hath an ear
[17:16] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[17:17] the churches
[17:18] to him that overcometh will I give to
[17:20] either the hidden Manna and will give
[17:22] him a white stone and end the stone a
[17:24] new name written which no man knoweth
[17:26] saving he that receiveth him amen let's
[17:29] pray Heavenly Father over the word
[17:32] we we bow our hearts and minds and souls
[17:36] over the word as our Prophet said in one
[17:39] place he said we stretch our souls
[17:41] across that word and and we measure our
[17:44] soul against that word Lord and and
[17:46] there's no gaps left in it and we thank
[17:48] you for that giving us the full word
[17:50] here in the end time
[17:51] revealing to us the the truth here for
[17:55] your elected lady help us today as we
[17:57] share in it talk about it Worship in It
[17:59] Whatever the people would have need of
[18:01] you are only the one that's mindful of
[18:03] that I can't know those things we can we
[18:06] can prepare as our as our brother
[18:08] Branham told us we can prepare ourselves
[18:10] prepare a message but only you Lord can
[18:14] can direct it to the hearts of the
[18:16] people we ask you to do that today in
[18:18] the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen God
[18:21] bless you may be seated this morning
[18:23] brother Wade got me water somewhere it's
[18:27] in this oh man
[18:29] we use bottles at home just bottled
[18:31] water so
[18:34] but I thank you for that because I'm
[18:36] feeling a little dry after all that
[18:39] abuse I got early on there so
[18:44] all right the Lord is good to us we we
[18:47] just chose for a title this morning we
[18:50] are going to take it out of verse 13.
[18:54] um we just we're going to call this
[18:56] brother Antipas how many of you know
[18:58] I've been in church a long time we came
[19:00] in the message in 1969
[19:04] has a young fellow there and raised up
[19:07] been preaching since 1979 and never had
[19:10] heard a lot
[19:12] spoke about Antipas
[19:15] brother anthopus who was my faithful
[19:17] martyr so
[19:19] now there might be a good reason for
[19:21] that and that is because
[19:24] we live in an age where
[19:27] the naysayers of this generation this
[19:30] great crop of unbelievers that once said
[19:32] they were Believers and they've rose up
[19:34] against this message
[19:35] they have come up with a
[19:38] a qualification for everything brother
[19:40] Branham said and that is that if you
[19:42] can't find a a historical piece of
[19:45] evidence or a newspaper article or or
[19:48] what they term as being third-party
[19:50] vindication
[19:51] then it probably brother Branham just
[19:54] made it up
[19:55] well isn't that a sad way to look at
[19:57] something that God has delivered in the
[19:58] end time
[19:59] that if we can't prove it by science or
[20:02] by history or by
[20:04] or by any other means natural man means
[20:08] that an example the bridge Vision you
[20:11] know brother I said I had a vision 16
[20:12] men fell in the water as they were
[20:14] building the bridge that was really the
[20:17] initial Vision that he told that got
[20:19] them all up in arms because they have
[20:22] searched every newspaper every
[20:24] chronological historical document
[20:27] and tried to prove that 16 men didn't
[20:29] fall in the river well or in the water
[20:32] while it was being built I'm not really
[20:34] too concerned about historical
[20:35] documentation for that
[20:37] I like something our brother Jim at home
[20:40] says he says I don't care if 16 men fell
[20:43] in the water while they were building
[20:44] the bridge he said I don't even care if
[20:45] they built the bridge I still believe
[20:47] that it is true
[20:49] there comes a point in time where Faith
[20:51] takes over and you just believe it
[20:54] and here's a good example because
[20:56] history
[20:57] history there's no historical
[21:00] documentation that no writer can find
[21:03] I've searched all the the scholars that
[21:06] we could find there there's there's
[21:07] tradition about this brother Antipas
[21:10] that is mentioned here in Revelations 12
[21:12] but they cannot find any birth records
[21:15] They don't know who his parents were
[21:16] they don't know where he came from they
[21:19] don't know what region he was he came
[21:21] into pergamia hit Orthodox history from
[21:25] about a thousand years after our Lord
[21:26] the Eastern Orthodox Church picked him
[21:29] up as one of their patron saints and
[21:31] said that John appointed him to be the
[21:33] Elder over pergamus but it's just all
[21:36] traditional history in fact as I was
[21:38] researching who this man was
[21:41] it says this the traditional and in
[21:45] Brackets it says possibly fictional
[21:47] Antipas
[21:50] you know
[21:51] possibly fictional
[21:54] how can a man that our Lord in
[21:55] addressing the pergament church he says
[21:58] our faithful brother Antipas a faithful
[22:01] martyr of that age man can look at it
[22:04] and say the traditional possibly
[22:07] fictional Antipas was reputed to be the
[22:10] bishop of the Christian church at
[22:12] pergamas
[22:13] I want you to know something I do not
[22:15] believe antipuss was fictional
[22:18] I don't care if they can't find this
[22:20] birth certificate
[22:22] I don't care if they can't find a
[22:24] tombstone marker that tells me where he
[22:26] was buried
[22:27] he actually wasn't buried because
[22:29] according to this tradition and I don't
[22:31] have any trouble believing in a little
[22:33] bit of tradition if it looks like it
[22:35] fits the word of God but the tradition
[22:37] was that he was roasted alive in a
[22:39] hollow life-sized Bull with a bonfire
[22:42] under its belly a big Iron bull that
[22:46] they had placed in front of the altar of
[22:48] one of their satanic evil gods and that
[22:51] he was roasted alive in this hollow bull
[22:53] giving his life for the word
[22:57] How could a man that Jesus himself the
[23:00] one who has the sharp two-edges sword in
[23:02] his hands says I want to talk about my
[23:04] faithful martyr antibis
[23:06] but man's mind will come down here and
[23:08] later in in generations to follow and
[23:10] say he was probably just a fictional
[23:12] character
[23:13] he was not a fictional character he
[23:15] called him by name
[23:17] come on brothers and sisters
[23:20] so according to the guidelines that
[23:22] everybody is putting on brother Branham
[23:23] Revelations chapter 2 and verse 13 did
[23:26] not even exist
[23:29] come on that's how they qualify it
[23:31] if we can't there's a new website out
[23:34] there called searching for vindication
[23:37] we can't believe anything unless we can
[23:39] find a historical document or or a
[23:42] historical reason that this happened or
[23:45] something to tell us that is true you
[23:48] know there's just a lot of things about
[23:49] this message that Faith takes over
[23:53] and you think how you gonna ever prove
[23:56] anything that we have right come on
[24:00] now I'm just I'm amazed at how weak
[24:03] their efforts become day after day how
[24:05] are you going to prove that he was out
[24:07] there in that field and left his gun on
[24:09] the seat of the truck and the bull came
[24:12] charging and it's the very question I
[24:15] asked that brother out there in
[24:16] Cloverdale I was texting him when he
[24:18] first came out with that with that
[24:21] from the pits of hell
[24:23] website that he's promoting now
[24:25] I asked him that I said how can we prove
[24:28] how can we give any kind of third party
[24:30] Vindication that that bull charged at
[24:32] brother Branham and and and as he was
[24:35] approaching he apologized for walking on
[24:37] his territory and and we had in that
[24:41] little example for the first time in
[24:43] many of our lives a true example of what
[24:45] real love can do when love is projected
[24:48] I believe it happened
[24:51] how are we gonna ever prove that you're
[24:53] not gonna prove that how are we going to
[24:55] prove those squirrels were created how
[24:57] are we going to prove that Jesus walked
[24:59] on the water
[25:00] come on you're not gonna prove any of it
[25:02] but we believe that it happened
[25:04] I I asked that brother that that
[25:06] publishes that website how can we
[25:08] possibly document this in such a way
[25:11] there's there's nobody out there but
[25:13] brother Brandon in the bowl
[25:15] but as he told that story I said brother
[25:17] there are millions of people millions in
[25:20] this message that have saw true love for
[25:23] the first time in their lives from that
[25:26] little example
[25:28] prove it oh my goodness but now
[25:31] everybody's good they're going to ask
[25:32] you can you show me that can you prove
[25:34] it well this is what happened with
[25:35] adamus he was
[25:37] he was just a faithful martyr there and
[25:40] there's no history nobody can find any
[25:42] history it was he was reputed to be the
[25:45] bishop of the Christian church at
[25:46] pergamus
[25:48] that he was martyred for his faith
[25:50] because of his consistent faithful
[25:52] witnessing in the face of all the
[25:54] satanic evil
[25:55] that was present there so that came
[25:58] about 1 000 years
[26:00] after our Lord was here that this that
[26:03] this
[26:04] his that's that's all we got on him John
[26:06] supposedly many this Eastern Orthodox
[26:09] Christian Church believes that that John
[26:12] appointed him as the bishop of
[26:15] but little else is factually known about
[26:18] Antipas from respective historical
[26:20] sources
[26:21] there's your key right there respective
[26:23] historical sources
[26:25] I do not need one respected historical
[26:28] source to tell me that this message is
[26:31] true
[26:32] I do not need one I don't I don't need I
[26:35] don't need to worry about dates I don't
[26:37] need to worry about when somebody was
[26:39] born they've developed a timeline now to
[26:41] show that brother Brown's timeline was
[26:43] all off on dates and who's interested in
[26:46] that I'm interested in Malachi 4 did not
[26:49] come to just give us a book of Visions
[26:51] to see fulfilled that was just pointers
[26:53] along the way he came to open the word
[26:57] how could I turn against this I'm
[26:59] standing there like Peter was after all
[27:01] those disciples had walked away from our
[27:02] Lord and he looks at the twelve he's got
[27:04] left and says why don't you go away also
[27:07] I'll tell you I'm standing there in
[27:09] Peter's shoes this morning I got nowhere
[27:11] else to go
[27:13] I have seen I believe this true report
[27:15] and I have Lord to whom can we go
[27:19] this is the words of eternal life amen
[27:22] this message is the word of eternal life
[27:24] to this age I have nowhere else to go
[27:26] right right and where are we gonna go
[27:28] but you got let's go back to where we
[27:30] were before yeah that was a lot of fun
[27:31] back then wasn't it yeah if that was so
[27:34] wonderful why are you here
[27:37] in fact if you can you can't turn back
[27:39] it the scripture tells us it's better
[27:40] off that you had never left because
[27:42] you're too full for the child of Hell
[27:44] than you were when you walked out
[27:48] Vindication but we're going to talk
[27:49] about this age this age and I want you
[27:52] to notice there in verse 13.
[27:54] twice he mentions a very important point
[27:56] and this was a message I took at home
[27:58] the other day I Know Thy works and where
[28:01] thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is
[28:05] you know it's one thing to reinforce it
[28:07] but at once but on down he says I'll
[28:10] hold as fast as my name has not denied
[28:13] my faith even in those days where an
[28:15] octopus was my faithful martyr who was
[28:16] slain among you where Satan dwelleth
[28:21] where Satan dwelleth a a tremendously
[28:24] evil and I gave the brothers my quotes
[28:28] today I tried to do it he did I like the
[28:30] way they put those quotes up there I
[28:31] enjoyed following that the other night
[28:33] so number one let's go to number one
[28:35] I heard Brother Sam do it that way give
[28:37] me number one up there on the screen
[28:39] all right here we are here's number one
[28:42] look at paragraph 64 there man that's
[28:44] good
[28:45] I have to train our guys when we get
[28:47] back home you know
[28:49] brother Branham and Satan's eating
[28:51] there's the God of this world that I
[28:54] preached to you about last Sunday he is
[28:56] here today in deceit
[28:58] talking about our day now here he is
[29:00] today in deceit that treacherous hour
[29:05] oh yeah I thought it was I thought down
[29:07] at the end when everybody's in love with
[29:09] everybody and we're ready to go on the
[29:10] Rapture we're going to just be a
[29:11] wonderful bubble dance in time
[29:14] Brethren says that treacherous hour
[29:17] that tremendous time that we're living
[29:20] right now how many of y'all have ever
[29:22] used that statement that brother random
[29:23] made famous for us if I could live in
[29:25] any age I'd rather live in this age than
[29:27] he got how many of you ever done that
[29:28] I've done it a lot
[29:29] we don't he's going to explain why this
[29:32] is it's the most glorious time of all
[29:35] the ages
[29:36] because we're facing the great
[29:38] Millennium again we're facing the Eden
[29:40] again
[29:41] that's what makes it that tremendous
[29:43] time it's the most glorious time but
[29:45] right at this age
[29:47] all the deceit
[29:49] and every tactic that he's ever used and
[29:52] been able to deceive with
[29:55] he's gathered it all together and
[29:57] reinforced himself
[29:59] wow how many of you think it's a grand
[30:02] and glorious age now
[30:04] that we live in an age where the enemy
[30:06] Satan who is the God of this evil world
[30:08] has right at this age he's took all the
[30:12] deceit
[30:13] and every tactic
[30:15] every way that he has ever drawn away a
[30:18] man from the word he has done it in this
[30:20] age he's gathered it all together and
[30:22] reinforced himself
[30:24] that's Satan's Eden right there
[30:27] we live in an age where when those seals
[30:30] were open you go over there to the Book
[30:31] of Revelations you'll find two hundred
[30:33] thousand thousand demons are released
[30:36] from the river you Freight these and
[30:38] you're in my age
[30:40] how many of you feel like saying Thank
[30:41] You Lord now I mean hey wait a minute
[30:44] you said this was the most grand and
[30:46] glorious age and here we are living in
[30:47] this age and 200 000 000 demons that
[30:50] have been reserved since they fell from
[30:52] from before there was an earth
[30:55] when they were kicked out of heaven and
[30:58] Satan drew them out of Heaven they've
[30:59] been reserved
[31:01] for our day
[31:03] oh my think of it he's gathered it all
[31:06] together and there's the key he
[31:08] reinforced himself with what two hundred
[31:11] thousand thousand more demons that he
[31:13] didn't already have use of
[31:15] they've been held and reserved in that
[31:18] river Euphrates until our day and now
[31:20] they're released and they've come down
[31:21] like God he has he's come down like God
[31:24] and has put himself
[31:27] oh my
[31:28] in the place of God
[31:32] religious
[31:33] oh man religious can't quote the
[31:36] scripture
[31:37] and can tell you scripture just as Satan
[31:39] did to even the Garden of Eden but leave
[31:41] out one spot of it is all he has to do
[31:43] make that Gap where the poison doctrine
[31:46] of the devil can pour through like the
[31:48] thinking Mass filter we was talking
[31:50] about the other day
[31:51] paragraph 65 he said he would exalt
[31:54] himself above the most high he would
[31:55] Ascend above the clouds and the Stars he
[31:58] would sit there like God be above the
[32:00] most high and he has succeeded in
[32:03] carrying out his threats he has
[32:05] certainly had a marvelous success in
[32:07] carrying out his threats by the people
[32:10] how does he succeed by the people
[32:12] letting him explain away in every age
[32:15] the value of God's promised words to
[32:18] that age
[32:19] that's exactly how he's done it in every
[32:22] age
[32:22] he explained it away
[32:24] brother random goes on and gives us one
[32:26] little example look at that's exactly
[32:28] how he done it in the days of Noah he
[32:30] explained that it was impossible for it
[32:31] to rain from Heaven there's no rain up
[32:33] there his great scientific gospel
[32:37] that had to have some third-party
[32:39] Vindication behind it some kind of proof
[32:41] some kind of scientific proof
[32:43] there's men that have served in this
[32:46] message and preached it for 30 plus
[32:48] years now are standing up and all of a
[32:50] sudden they're telling you
[32:51] that cloud that happened out there in
[32:53] Arizona that wasn't a supernatural event
[32:56] that was some kind of a rocket that went
[32:58] off in California and that vapor trail
[32:59] came across there and Life Magazine took
[33:02] the picture
[33:03] that's after preaching this message for
[33:06] 30 plus years right what has he done the
[33:09] in the the scientific gospel that he
[33:12] preached in the Garden of Eden he could
[33:14] shoot the instruments to the Moon prove
[33:16] there's no moisture up there but God
[33:17] said there would come a rain
[33:19] but Satan succeeded and poisoned the
[33:22] mind of the people
[33:24] right how is this going to work how is
[33:26] he going to deceive with all these
[33:28] reinforcements and using every tactic
[33:30] he's ever used before he has poisoned
[33:33] the minds of the People by scientific
[33:35] research
[33:36] that it could not be done but it was
[33:39] done God said it would be done and it
[33:40] was done he did it
[33:43] don't you see where does the onslaught
[33:46] come from
[33:47] where where did where did we learn the
[33:49] greatest battle ever fought was going to
[33:51] be
[33:52] not a newspaper batacle battle is not a
[33:55] uh looking for an article to back us up
[33:57] battle it's in the mind of the people
[34:00] he's poisoned the minds of the people
[34:02] the scientific mind
[34:04] of the people
[34:06] right there's your example quote number
[34:08] two this is exactly what we just read
[34:10] out of Satan's Eden how can I overcome
[34:12] we see this age that we're living in
[34:15] there we are
[34:17] let me get a Hallelujah this is the
[34:19] grandest age of all ages
[34:21] this layout of the Sea of church ages of
[34:23] the grandest of all the church ages
[34:25] because of how I've talked to people I
[34:28] know I've talked to people I'd like to
[34:30] live when Jesus lived well you wouldn't
[34:32] have been no different back there than
[34:33] you are now
[34:35] hanging around him wasn't going to
[34:37] change any
[34:38] well if I did just if I could have just
[34:41] backed up 40 years and hung around
[34:42] brother Branham I'd have been a
[34:43] different man no you wouldn't
[34:45] come on I knew a lot of those guys that
[34:48] hung around brother Branham that's why
[34:50] after he was going off the scene they
[34:52] went ahead and had polygamous wives and
[34:54] everything else
[34:55] oh if I could have just just walked
[34:57] through if I could have hunted with him
[34:58] up there in Colorado
[35:00] if I could have just just been there the
[35:02] day the pillar of fire come down on the
[35:04] Ohio River I'd have been a different
[35:05] person you wouldn't be any different
[35:07] than you are now you can't pick another
[35:10] age that you would be different than you
[35:12] are right now because either the word
[35:14] catches your attention or it doesn't
[35:17] but it's the grandest of all the church
[35:19] ages because you want to know why this
[35:21] is the greatest age you could ever live
[35:23] in because it's the ending of time and
[35:25] the blending of Eternity
[35:28] oh my that's wonderful isn't it
[35:30] here's where we're living it's the
[35:32] grandest of all the ages but then and
[35:34] then
[35:35] it's the greatest sinful age
[35:39] man why'd you put me down here Lord
[35:42] come on you moaners and groaners you
[35:44] ready now oh Lord why'd you put me down
[35:46] here it's so hard
[35:48] so hard down here go tell that to
[35:50] Antipas my faithful martyr
[35:52] it's so hard down here it's more sin in
[35:55] this age than there's ever been
[35:58] and the powers of Satan is many times
[36:00] harder to fight against
[36:01] than it was in any HC
[36:08] we'll come back to that and finish it in
[36:10] just a minute but go to number three
[36:12] we might come back to paragraph 45 there
[36:15] in just a minute
[36:17] here's how it's this is how it works do
[36:19] you realize old man this is way back in
[36:21] 56. you can see when it was blushing
[36:24] profit do you realize old men
[36:26] now y'all can qualify who's really
[36:27] talking to there sitting here this
[36:29] morning
[36:30] I don't know what age you are old
[36:33] they have tore that apart we all have
[36:35] heard Billy Paul's testimony brother
[36:37] Brown told me before I'm an old man
[36:40] so when I was reading this do you
[36:41] realize old man they have worried about
[36:43] whether brother Billy Paul is an old man
[36:45] or not
[36:46] they have took days of discussion what
[36:50] do you call an old man
[36:52] how old is old
[36:55] I hope you're not putting me in that
[36:57] category look at me
[37:00] you know I have trouble with this old
[37:02] man young man thing
[37:04] I used to go to a lot of Youth meetings
[37:07] and I kept lining up at them and they
[37:09] wouldn't give me a ticket to come in the
[37:10] door after a while
[37:12] my children were telling me dad that's
[37:14] not for you that's for us you know but I
[37:17] thought I still belong when I hear
[37:19] there's a youth Revival on I still want
[37:21] to go
[37:22] but you figure out what old is I'm not
[37:25] going to sit around and worry about
[37:26] brother Billy Paul what an old man means
[37:28] you won't be an old man when sharks are
[37:31] swimming here maybe he's already going
[37:32] to be on the other side and change back
[37:34] into his theophany body and be young
[37:36] when that happens I don't know how that
[37:38] fulfills right right I'm not worried
[37:40] about how that fulfills but you can find
[37:43] pages of debate online about what an old
[37:46] man is
[37:48] so all of you fellows there some of you
[37:49] that are gray and some of you that have
[37:51] none you can just decide if you fit that
[37:53] category or not
[37:55] do you realize old man when we were boys
[37:57] our boys has got 10 times the Temptation
[38:00] that we had
[38:02] not just twice as hard but ten times
[38:05] sister do you realize that your daughter
[38:07] has 10 times the Temptation you had when
[38:10] you was a girl what will her daughter
[38:12] have
[38:13] it'll be another 10 times over
[38:16] well look at the things the pictures the
[38:18] devils are painting oh how we need to
[38:20] pray that's still good advice I don't
[38:22] care if he said it in 1956 if the seals
[38:25] wasn't open yet or not we still need to
[38:28] pray because why it was 10 times worse
[38:31] for his generation and 10 times worse
[38:34] for his kids and now he's got grandkids
[38:36] and it's 10 times worse for them and you
[38:39] get 10 times 10 times 10 times 10.
[38:42] foreign
[38:44] I've met people but we just don't want
[38:47] to bring a child into this world because
[38:48] it's so evil
[38:50] what kind of faith faith in the word is
[38:52] that right right
[38:54] what kind of faith in the word is that
[38:56] the same God that kept me through my
[38:58] three times ten whenever that generation
[39:01] was we'll keep a new one that comes into
[39:04] the world
[39:05] I run into people man we're not gonna
[39:08] have no kids because this world's so
[39:09] evil
[39:10] right
[39:12] it's because you don't have confidence
[39:14] that God can keep you to the end that's
[39:16] why I can't believe he can keep your
[39:18] children and you know how you know he
[39:20] will we got a little thing that we
[39:21] learned a whole lot about and ain't got
[39:22] enough time to even begin talking about
[39:24] it called the token that we place over
[39:26] our children
[39:27] we've got a token here in the end time
[39:29] that came by a vehicle called the word
[39:31] and we apply that token over our
[39:34] children because each generation after
[39:35] ours is 10 times worse than we had it
[39:39] 10 times worse
[39:41] do you believe that
[39:44] well I just don't know about that well
[39:46] that's not even hard to figure out I'm
[39:49] 54 years old so you can decide I'm not
[39:51] old man
[39:52] if you're 54 and under you are a young
[39:54] man that's brother Tom's definition
[40:01] there was a question raised up fine
[40:03] young individual asked a question last
[40:05] night who is older brother Wayne or
[40:07] brother Terence
[40:13] the greatest offense came from that
[40:15] statement
[40:18] I don't need to tell you we're not going
[40:21] to worry about what an old man young man
[40:23] one of these days we're going to be all
[40:25] 18. how about that those who believe the
[40:28] word have a body coming
[40:30] he's talking about crow's feet the other
[40:33] night
[40:34] pimples talking about as we grow we get
[40:36] the pimples then we get the crow's feet
[40:38] and we get get all these marks on our
[40:40] face and
[40:43] you know I'm looking at just I don't
[40:46] know how to be honest I'm looking for
[40:47] something a little better than when I
[40:48] was 18. I mean it wasn't all that great
[40:49] at 18 either you know I mean come on if
[40:54] y'all are happy with that then hope for
[40:55] that okay
[40:57] but man I want to get on the other side
[40:59] and I want to be buff
[41:03] I never had no six-pack abs but if you
[41:06] see me on the other side
[41:07] look for a guy sporting a pack of
[41:09] six-pack abs
[41:11] I'm sure I have them they're just
[41:13] covered up you can't can't find them
[41:15] under there
[41:16] everybody I want to be like I was at 18.
[41:18] well I wasn't all that great at 18
[41:19] either but the Lord knows he's we the
[41:22] good thing about getting over there
[41:23] we're going to know everybody anyway
[41:25] there ain't gonna be no that's the one
[41:27] thing you won't have when you get on the
[41:28] other side introductions
[41:30] then well you won't need who is that
[41:32] over there you're gonna know who that is
[41:34] brother man said we'll all know each
[41:36] other
[41:37] that's the kind of age that we're living
[41:39] in that's the kind I wanted you to see
[41:41] why is it the greatest age why right
[41:43] it's tremendous age that we're living in
[41:45] why it's because we're at the ending of
[41:48] time the blending in of Eternity that's
[41:52] why it's it's a it's a privilege
[41:55] to live in laodicea we don't sit around
[41:58] oh Lord why'd you put me down here in
[42:00] such an evil sin curse world it's so bad
[42:03] out there it is bad out there
[42:05] it's ten times worse than it was when
[42:07] our Prophet was here and his children
[42:09] had it 10 times worse over and now it's
[42:10] 10 times more that and now we got those
[42:13] thousand thousand two hundred thousand
[42:15] thousand demons released here in our age
[42:17] to make it two hundred thousand thousand
[42:20] times worse than it was before those
[42:22] seals were open that's how Bleak the
[42:25] picture is but not for us
[42:27] because we believe the word
[42:30] it doesn't matter there is going to be
[42:33] someone in this age that will fulfill
[42:36] first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[42:39] that's why it's a privilege to live here
[42:41] you know we got we got a friend me and
[42:43] brother Chad that he works for in there
[42:45] at home and and he always talks about
[42:47] when we're out working he'll talk about
[42:48] how all these southern gospel quartets
[42:51] when they're singing about heaven all
[42:53] they're talking about is streets of gold
[42:55] and mansions and and how easy it's going
[42:58] to be over there and how rich we're
[42:59] going to be
[43:01] and that's why they all want to go I
[43:02] just want to go home I want to get to my
[43:04] mansion
[43:05] come on
[43:07] he says it's like some kind of goodie
[43:09] bag that you get down at the end of The
[43:11] Journey gonna give you all these prizes
[43:13] for making it through
[43:15] you're going to be so happy to be there
[43:17] you don't care if you're living in a
[43:18] mansion or a straw Hut
[43:20] a matter amen amen I was talking about a
[43:23] little y'all remember that song walking
[43:25] on new shoes getting ready to move y'all
[43:26] remember that song the old southern
[43:28] gospel song new shoes it's all about
[43:30] getting to Heaven new shoes new robes
[43:33] streets of gold mansions
[43:35] jewels
[43:38] oh my I think why I want to go home I
[43:42] don't even want to go home because
[43:42] somebody talked about me last week yes
[43:45] you get a lot of people you know I just
[43:47] want to go home so bad no
[43:50] you don't really wanna
[43:52] I'm like Paul I'm not really Desiring to
[43:54] be
[43:55] unclothed but clothed upon right right I
[43:59] probably told you I don't know I might
[44:00] have mentioned this one time I used to
[44:01] watch as a kid I always like to analyze
[44:04] a little bit of everything I hear and
[44:05] I'd watch him old Saints get up and then
[44:07] you know there was people that were
[44:09] professional testifiers you all ever run
[44:11] into any of them it was almost like you
[44:13] could finish it for them because you
[44:15] knew what they were going to say next
[44:16] and they'd get up and they get to tell I
[44:18] just want to go home so bad
[44:21] broke down
[44:24] oh I want to see Jesus so bad they're
[44:27] crying
[44:28] and then they'll get six next next week
[44:30] they've come down with some big ailment
[44:32] and you know what we find on the pulpit
[44:34] of prayer request that they'll get
[44:35] better
[44:37] exactly yeah I'm sitting there thinking
[44:39] wait a minute hold on
[44:41] wait I'm confused
[44:44] last week he just wanted to go home so
[44:46] bad
[44:48] looks like the Lord's opening up an
[44:49] Avenue for that and
[44:52] but now that we're down to the crunch
[44:55] time
[44:56] we found out they didn't want to go home
[44:58] so bad after all
[45:01] so they got the people praying
[45:04] they go to the doctor and get them some
[45:05] stay longer pills
[45:08] come on what happened to wanting to go
[45:09] home so bad
[45:13] or you let somebody talk about you in
[45:15] the church and we get all down in the
[45:17] mouth don't we
[45:19] oh you should just heard what that
[45:20] brother said about me oh
[45:23] we cry
[45:24] and we get all broke up and all that's
[45:27] wrong
[45:28] it is
[45:29] don't talk about your brothers and
[45:31] sisters but that's usually when we get
[45:34] the most poor mouth in this when things
[45:35] are going rough when all this wrapped up
[45:39] magnified demonic age that we live in is
[45:41] coming against us we just want to go
[45:44] home Paul said you know I do want to go
[45:46] home
[45:47] but I'll tell you why I want to go home
[45:48] it's because I live in this age where
[45:50] that I can fulfill the word in this age
[45:53] that somebody is going to be alive and
[45:55] remain into the change of these bodies
[45:58] somebody is going to take their flight
[46:01] without having to die that's the
[46:03] privilege of living in laodicea that's
[46:06] the overcoming what is the final Triumph
[46:08] in this age a bride that will take her
[46:11] change without seeing death
[46:14] that is the Final Redemption what did
[46:16] the book of is it in James it says what
[46:19] is that Final Redemption the Redemption
[46:21] of our bodies
[46:22] when when our body that's the privilege
[46:25] of living in laodicea sure we got more
[46:27] onslaught of demonic power than we've
[46:29] ever had sure we got the homosexuals
[46:31] raging everywhere
[46:33] it's still a sin brothers and sisters
[46:35] there's no way to politically correct
[46:37] say that homosexuality is acceptable
[46:40] it's a sin it's created by the devil
[46:43] it's a it's a it's a perversion of
[46:45] mankind
[46:47] you hear Brother Brad I'm crying against
[46:49] it back in the 50s talking about San
[46:50] Francisco I was reading an article in
[46:52] now look at where it's come to how he's
[46:55] reinforced himself they're worrying
[46:57] about now whether we should let Boy
[46:58] Scouts in
[47:00] Boy Scouts when when would you have ever
[47:02] thought that boy scouts and
[47:03] homosexuality would ever be muttered in
[47:05] the same breath
[47:07] come on that's how it's gotten down you
[47:09] know it's how evil it is
[47:12] I want to go home not because you know
[47:14] they said when those children of Israel
[47:16] left Egypt there was the true children
[47:19] of Israel that came out those two
[47:21] million strong but you know they said
[47:22] there was some Vagabond Egyptians that
[47:24] also wanted to go along they weren't
[47:27] happy with how Pharaoh was running the
[47:28] country
[47:29] and so along with them that's why the
[47:31] scripture says there was a mixed
[47:32] multitude that came out with them it's
[47:34] because they weren't all Israelites they
[47:36] weren't all true Israel there were just
[47:37] some folks that didn't like the
[47:38] government
[47:40] sound like America don't it
[47:42] I don't want to go home because Obama's
[47:44] in control but that's a good reason come
[47:47] on I hope ain't no Obama fans here yeah
[47:54] man
[47:56] Obama I've always said he is the
[47:58] Abomination that makes a desolation
[48:00] you'll find him over there in the
[48:02] scripture
[48:03] Obama he was going to be the savior of
[48:06] the country and now his health care is
[48:09] coming in next year how many ready for
[48:10] that
[48:12] I'm just gonna go on and get sick so I
[48:14] can get me some Obamacare my goodness I
[48:17] hope not either
[48:21] that's how that's how weak our nation
[48:23] has become that they would put their
[48:25] faith in some kind of a governmental
[48:27] system that's going to do something for
[48:29] them there's only one hope my dear
[48:31] brothers and sisters and that is that we
[48:33] can live so close to this word is that
[48:35] when he comes and calls this word from
[48:37] the earth only he who now let us will
[48:39] let until he be taken out of the way who
[48:42] is that he brother Bradham said that's
[48:44] this bride until she is taken out of the
[48:47] way he calls for his word
[48:49] it's not that whoa I'm just so happy
[48:51] he's gonna call for Tom Earnest one of
[48:53] these days the only reason I'm going to
[48:54] get to go is because I'm a part of that
[48:56] word he calls his word back to himself
[48:59] and me being a part of that word I'm
[49:01] going to be changed and I'm going to be
[49:03] gone I sing in that song I'm gonna be
[49:06] gone in the twinkling of an eye I'm
[49:08] gonna be gone and won't have time to say
[49:10] goodbye I ain't worried about shooting
[49:11] up through the air and Graves open and
[49:13] all that kind of
[49:14] rigmarole that we learned the Rapture
[49:16] was going to be
[49:18] but there is a change coming my dear
[49:20] brothers and sisters it's a sinful evil
[49:23] adulterous age but right in the midst of
[49:26] it this is what I'm talking about
[49:27] Overcomers
[49:29] here was Antipas an overcomer look at
[49:32] verse 13 again where thou dwelleth even
[49:35] where Satan's seed is that's
[49:37] oh my overcoming right there where the
[49:41] man has his headquarters
[49:43] for you to see this word brothers and
[49:46] sisters it's as great of a Triumph as
[49:48] Antipas was crawling in that Iron Bowl
[49:51] he's the least you know I ran down the
[49:53] list of Martyrs you want to hear a list
[49:55] of Martyrs y'all probably heard a lot of
[49:57] this before but but let me who you know
[49:59] who the first one was Stephen he got the
[50:01] ball rolling didn't he
[50:03] we got the book of Acts there's lots we
[50:05] can say about Stephen we can preach
[50:07] whole sermons on Stephen
[50:09] but there was about 2 000 Christians was
[50:12] martyred during that time
[50:14] we know nothing about activists there's
[50:16] lots of history about these other men
[50:17] Andrew the brother of Peter you know he
[50:19] was crucified as well
[50:22] he was he was much like Peter who was
[50:24] also crucified
[50:26] but Andrew was crucified on an x-shaped
[50:29] cross he had the same anointing that
[50:31] Peter did he wouldn't let him crucify
[50:32] him in the regular position because he
[50:34] didn't feel worthy of that because that
[50:36] was how our Lord had been crucified and
[50:38] so they turned the cross into an x-shape
[50:40] and crucified him
[50:42] and it's known today as Andrew's cross
[50:44] you can find that in your history it's
[50:45] Peter of course was crucified he asked
[50:48] him to crucify him upside down at his
[50:50] own request so that James the son of
[50:52] Zebedee
[50:53] you'll find his his martyrdom in the
[50:56] book of Acts chapter 12 who was a Herod
[50:58] or one of those
[51:00] um
[51:01] Roman or or
[51:03] overseers of the land at that time he
[51:06] had James the son of Zebedee who was the
[51:08] elder brother of John he had him run
[51:10] through with the sword
[51:11] you'll find that in the book of Acts
[51:13] chapter 12. he that was around 44. A.D
[51:17] which was 10 years after Stephen had
[51:19] been stoned to death
[51:21] there and also earlier in the book of
[51:23] Acts Philip
[51:25] all of you know who Philip was in the
[51:26] Bible he was scourged thrown in prison
[51:29] they drug him out after that and they
[51:31] crucified him around 54 A.D 10 years
[51:35] Matthew however everybody always picks
[51:37] on Matthew because he was a tax
[51:39] collector
[51:40] even the tax collectors had it rough
[51:43] back in the early church around 60 A.D
[51:46] he was down in Ethiopia and they ran him
[51:48] through with a sword
[51:49] James the brother of Jesus this one
[51:52] really got to me James was 94 years old
[51:56] listen now
[51:58] here's a Christian 94 years old and they
[52:01] stoned him
[52:03] I got one question how many rocks is it
[52:05] going to take to finish off a 94 year
[52:08] old fella
[52:09] talking about an old man 94 years old
[52:12] they stoned him they finally had to take
[52:14] and he didn't die under the Stony this
[52:17] was one tough 94 year old
[52:19] he took the stoning and they finally had
[52:22] to to bash his brains out with what was
[52:24] a Fuller's Club they finally took a club
[52:26] to him
[52:28] at 94 right
[52:30] right let the poor fellow alone he got
[52:32] much longer to be with us anyway but
[52:34] there was such an anointing in that land
[52:36] he that was the brother of Jesus 94
[52:39] years old Matthias
[52:41] you know who Matthias was he was the
[52:43] fellow over there that the apostles
[52:44] chose to take the place of Judas
[52:47] Iscariot and brother when I said we
[52:49] never heard nothing else from him he
[52:50] didn't have any part in the ministry but
[52:52] yet he went off he was he was stoned in
[52:55] Jerusalem and then they beheaded him
[52:57] after they stoned him
[52:58] Mark Mark The Book of Mark he was
[53:01] dragged to pieces in Alexandria in front
[53:04] of the Pagan idols of course we know
[53:06] that Paul was beheaded Jude the book of
[53:09] Jude crucified to the place called
[53:11] Odessa around 72 Adu Bartholomew one of
[53:15] the Apostles beaten and crucified down
[53:17] in India
[53:18] Thomas and he ministered in Parthia and
[53:22] in India and they thrust him through
[53:24] with the spear Luke all of us our
[53:26] beloved Luke they hanged him on an olive
[53:28] tree Barnabas in Cyprus they wasn't
[53:32] quite sure how he died but he got named
[53:34] among the martyrs Simon zelodi's you
[53:37] know him from the scriptures Down in
[53:38] Africa he ministered in Britain and
[53:40] Africa he was also crucified
[53:42] one of the most amazing ones is our own
[53:44] beloved John that wrote the Book of
[53:46] Revelations he made the list in Fox's
[53:49] book of Martyrs and he survived
[53:52] right come on
[53:54] come on they boiled him in a pot of oil
[53:57] trying to get the truth out of him they
[53:59] couldn't ball him in all and he survived
[54:01] but he still made the list of Martyrs
[54:04] come on we got to redefine martyrdom
[54:06] don't we maybe it's a guy that takes all
[54:09] you can put on him
[54:11] and he still keeps on licking and keeps
[54:14] on ticking
[54:15] maybe that's what a laodicean martyr is
[54:18] going to really look like is a man in
[54:20] the end time that can hold on to that
[54:22] word as John held on to the word and he
[54:25] can get bald and he can get beat and he
[54:28] can get skewered and he can take it all
[54:31] and he can stand up in the end and he
[54:33] can go over there and write one more
[54:34] book and he says love one another my
[54:36] dear brothers that's what a real martyr
[54:39] is in the end time I can take it go
[54:42] ahead and hit me because according to
[54:44] that that that that here of Jubilee
[54:48] there's gonna come a time where he's
[54:49] going to hit us for the last time and
[54:51] then we're going to hear that Jubilee
[54:53] trumping we're going to be out of here
[54:54] that's what a real martyr is is a man
[54:56] that can take it all and still hold his
[54:59] testimony and in the end after come on
[55:02] how many y'all been boiled
[55:04] I watched that that monster fish I
[55:07] caught get boiled in oil the other night
[55:08] I never had that
[55:11] we're all jumping back from that pot oil
[55:14] John was boiled in it and he came down
[55:17] to the end he says dearly beloved let us
[55:19] love one another
[55:21] that's a real martyr right there that's
[55:23] the sign of a true martyr that can take
[55:25] everything that the devil can lick out
[55:27] at him
[55:28] that can take it all and still stay in
[55:31] love with his brother that can take all
[55:33] the abuse that that the church members
[55:35] can Heap on him from time to time
[55:37] through misunderstanding or bad
[55:39] attitudes of their own and can still
[55:41] love that body can still love this word
[55:44] that's what a real martyr in the end
[55:46] time looks like I believe it
[55:48] back to that paragraph that quote number
[55:50] two that I gave him let's finish that
[55:52] one from a few minutes ago
[55:54] look at something brother Branham says
[55:56] talking about those early church age
[55:57] martyrs number two in paragraph 45
[56:00] they're back there in the early ages
[56:02] look at how brother Branham looks at
[56:04] this back there in the early ages a
[56:06] Christian could for his profession
[56:08] profession of in a church of belonging
[56:11] to Christ he could be beheaded for it
[56:14] he could be killed and put out of his
[56:16] misery and go to meet God quickly but
[56:19] now
[56:20] come on you're fixing to find out this
[56:23] is a little better option than what
[56:25] we've got
[56:26] he says back then he could be killed and
[56:29] put out of his misery and go to meet God
[56:30] quickly but now the enemy has come in in
[56:33] the name of the church and it's so
[56:35] deceiving this is the great age of
[56:37] deception Christ said so the two Spirits
[56:39] would be so close until it would you see
[56:41] the very elected if it was possible see
[56:43] Christ spoke of an elected people for
[56:45] the last day it would deceive the very
[56:47] elected if it were possible
[56:51] so close
[56:52] let me show you how close it is the
[56:54] people
[56:55] so live people can live a clean holy
[56:58] life
[56:59] this is the deception of the age people
[57:01] can live a clean holy life not be sinful
[57:05] adulterers Drinkers and liars and
[57:08] gamblers they can live above that
[57:10] and still not have it still not with it
[57:14] oh that's a mystery ain't it right we
[57:17] thought all those were evidences of the
[57:18] Holy Ghost
[57:20] living a clean holy life not be sinful I
[57:23] love that message the other night how he
[57:25] went over here to this church age chart
[57:27] that we got on the wall here everybody's
[57:29] trying to figure out you know we just
[57:31] had brother Aaron McGarry at our main
[57:32] meetings and everybody he did such a
[57:34] wonderful job everybody's trying to
[57:36] figure out well it looks like from
[57:38] looking at this and we ain't gonna get
[57:39] the Holy Ghost till we get up here
[57:41] I love what our brother said you're not
[57:44] going to have any faith without the Holy
[57:45] Ghost
[57:46] you're not going to have it I'm not
[57:49] worried about whether I get it at the
[57:50] top or get it at the bottom
[57:52] so many teachings went out well you got
[57:55] to have faith
[57:56] before you can get virtues so you got to
[57:58] rise up one day say well I got faith now
[58:00] I'm ready to move on to virtue
[58:02] and then and then once I get Faith and
[58:03] virtue then I'm going to move over and
[58:05] then I'm going to give me some knowledge
[58:06] and until I get those three all sorted
[58:08] out I'm not going to get any Temperance
[58:10] I'm not going to get any patience
[58:13] funny every one of those guys that was
[58:14] building it like a step ladder they got
[58:16] it right up there
[58:17] and they couldn't get along with nobody
[58:21] yeah I've got all six now I'm ready for
[58:24] brotherly kindness and they didn't like
[58:26] none of us
[58:27] they had no friends
[58:29] they everybody was against them isn't it
[58:32] amazing that those who count so much on
[58:34] those virtues and getting those virtues
[58:36] always fail on brotherly kindness
[58:42] because they'll tell you if you don't
[58:43] see it like I see it you're just going
[58:44] to hell anyway
[58:46] how much brotherly kindness is there
[58:47] enough
[58:51] I appreciated that message you the night
[58:53] hey that little baby he ain't gonna
[58:55] learn to do nothing until he's born he's
[58:57] got to be born first and through that
[58:59] new birth you're going to receive that
[59:01] faith and without that new birth you're
[59:04] not gonna and without your love of this
[59:05] word and your bond in this word you
[59:07] ain't gonna have no brotherly kindness
[59:09] you might can stick in a few peacock
[59:11] feathers along the way and say look at
[59:13] my brotherly kindness peacock feathers
[59:15] right yeah but if you're still a black
[59:17] bird on the inside you're going to still
[59:19] be a blackbird it don't matter how much
[59:22] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[59:23] Temperance you stick into your being
[59:25] that's you doing it
[59:27] brother Branham ask a simple question he
[59:30] preached a whole message and we got one
[59:31] quote in a minute how can I overcome you
[59:35] know what the answer was you can't
[59:38] that's right hey y'all I remember as a
[59:40] young man I want to read that I want to
[59:41] know how I can overcome you know what
[59:43] the answer to the message was you can't
[59:45] overcome he must overcome in you you
[59:48] cannot overcome
[59:50] just like we can't kill our old husband
[59:52] right man we had fun with that up at the
[59:55] camp meeting talking about that
[59:57] he let it die
[59:59] don't you see it everything we kill out
[1:00:01] is going to come back
[1:00:03] we can't put them down for the count
[1:00:05] right we can subdue our with our natural
[1:00:08] efforts with our with our New Year's
[1:00:11] resolutions how many of you ever had a
[1:00:13] few of those that fell by the wayside
[1:00:15] how many of you made a resolution
[1:00:17] yesterday that fell by the wayside
[1:00:19] already because you can do it
[1:00:22] how can I overcome
[1:00:24] that's what we're talking about this
[1:00:25] morning Overcomers in an age that is
[1:00:28] more wicked than any age has ever been
[1:00:30] and you'll be standing up there numbered
[1:00:32] among brother Antipas you'll be numbered
[1:00:35] right up there with him a true martyr
[1:00:37] amen of that age let's go to that one
[1:00:39] how can I overcome
[1:00:41] I love this got to give you a little
[1:00:43] taste of this and we're gonna let you go
[1:00:45] we're not going to keep you long
[1:00:46] what do you all usually go to 132
[1:00:48] something like that yeah oh that's when
[1:00:50] you start again I'm sorry I forgot
[1:00:53] I forgot you all start at two o'clock I
[1:00:56] gotta get done here
[1:00:58] what happens if a guy ain't done by two
[1:01:00] o'clock y'all just run on through
[1:01:02] you ever done that yeah yeah not yet
[1:01:04] okay it won't happen today either so
[1:01:08] oh Overcomers of laodicea that's what we
[1:01:12] are brothers and sisters
[1:01:13] now what are we to overcome he had just
[1:01:15] read Revelations 3 21. what are we to
[1:01:18] overcome
[1:01:21] that's the normal question to ask here
[1:01:24] but that is not the ACT this is number
[1:01:25] five are we on the right one yeah no
[1:01:27] let's go to number five
[1:01:30] yeah
[1:01:31] there we go what are we to overcome
[1:01:34] this is out of the church age book what
[1:01:35] are we to overcome this is the normal
[1:01:36] question to ask
[1:01:38] but that's not the actual fault of this
[1:01:40] verse for oh I love this it is not so
[1:01:42] much what right remember this
[1:01:45] you want to overcome quit worrying about
[1:01:47] what you're supposed to overcome it is
[1:01:49] not so much what we are overcome but how
[1:01:52] we are to overcome that man now this is
[1:01:55] logical for does it matter much what we
[1:01:58] are to overcome as long as we know how
[1:02:01] we can overcome
[1:02:03] president you know most of us carry
[1:02:05] around a bucket list in our pocket
[1:02:07] you know what the bucket list is you got
[1:02:09] to do this for we're out of here
[1:02:11] I gotta do this I heard a man preaching
[1:02:13] one night me and my wife stopped in on a
[1:02:14] church it was the most
[1:02:16] gosh awful experience that I've just
[1:02:18] ever had
[1:02:19] he's sitting there and he's trying to
[1:02:21] tell us that there's three things we got
[1:02:23] to prove before we can get out of here
[1:02:25] three I'm thinking man I gotta prove
[1:02:27] nothing but go ahead tell me what I got
[1:02:28] to prove well number one we got to prove
[1:02:31] to the devil that we are the elect
[1:02:34] I'm thinking I don't know about that I
[1:02:35] probably already figured that out by now
[1:02:37] but amen this next one was we got to
[1:02:39] prove to God Who We Are
[1:02:42] I'm like wait a minute he knew me before
[1:02:44] the foundation of the world how am I
[1:02:46] going to stop and and then we got to
[1:02:47] prove well his whole message was simply
[1:02:50] when we get those vindications and those
[1:02:53] manifestations and the dead raised to
[1:02:55] life and the healings and the
[1:02:56] supernatural flowing among us then
[1:02:58] that's going to prove to the world Who
[1:03:00] We Are
[1:03:02] brothers and sisters that ain't going to
[1:03:03] prove nothing we've already had that and
[1:03:06] what is that proven
[1:03:07] if somebody died right here in the
[1:03:09] meeting I went back and prayed for and
[1:03:10] raised him from the dead that makes me
[1:03:12] no different than it than before the
[1:03:14] event happened
[1:03:15] that ain't gonna prove nothing
[1:03:17] there's no proof maybe God knows who we
[1:03:19] are I'm pretty sure the devil knows who
[1:03:21] we are and I and and before you're gonna
[1:03:24] get out of here you're gonna know who
[1:03:25] you are because when she recognizes who
[1:03:29] she is that's when we're going to be
[1:03:31] getting out of here that there's still
[1:03:34] proving there ain't nothing I'm gonna do
[1:03:35] to prove it to myself
[1:03:37] this is what brother Branham is saying
[1:03:39] we carry around a bucket list well I got
[1:03:41] to overcome this I got to quit this I
[1:03:43] gotta I gotta quit smoking I gotta quit
[1:03:45] drinking you know what I I just like the
[1:03:47] way brother Brown Put I smoke all I want
[1:03:49] to smoke right right I said that in my
[1:03:52] in the home church that I was staying in
[1:03:54] the basement of my niece and they got
[1:03:56] three little boys I was using that quote
[1:03:58] where I said man I just smoke all I'm
[1:04:00] just smoking all I want to smoke these
[1:04:02] days
[1:04:03] my niece's little boys ran up here after
[1:04:05] says Mama he'd been smoking in the
[1:04:06] basement what are we gonna do about that
[1:04:09] what we're gonna do brother Tom down
[1:04:11] there smoking in our basement
[1:04:15] oh man
[1:04:18] that's it how not what quit worrying
[1:04:20] about what you're gonna overcome
[1:04:22] what what what what attack is going to
[1:04:25] be next
[1:04:26] come on we get so worried about the
[1:04:28] attack putting a name on it we got to
[1:04:30] put a name on the next attack
[1:04:32] I can promise you there are
[1:04:34] reinforcements here in this age that
[1:04:36] every tactic and every deceit he's ever
[1:04:38] used you're going to get it used on your
[1:04:40] hair in the end time I don't know what
[1:04:42] form it's going to take in your life I
[1:04:44] don't know what form it'll take in my
[1:04:46] life but I am more than able through
[1:04:47] this word to meet that challenge
[1:04:50] I don't have to sit here and worry about
[1:04:51] what I'm going to overcome I just have
[1:04:54] to know how I'm going to overcome he
[1:04:56] went on it the next paragraph look at
[1:04:58] these scriptures that involve the Lord
[1:04:59] Jesus overcoming you know this very well
[1:05:03] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[1:05:05] this proposition in Matthew 4 Jesus is
[1:05:08] tempted to the devil he overcame the
[1:05:10] personal Temptations of Satan by the
[1:05:12] word
[1:05:13] how to say it with me how did he
[1:05:15] overcome the personal Temptations of
[1:05:17] Satan by the word and by the word only
[1:05:21] in each of the three major trials that
[1:05:24] correspond exactly to the Temptation Of
[1:05:27] The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh
[1:05:29] the lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:05:31] life Jesus overcame by the word
[1:05:35] amen Eve fell to the personal Temptation
[1:05:37] Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam
[1:05:40] fell in direct Disobedience to the word
[1:05:42] but Jesus overcame by the word and right
[1:05:47] now let me say that's the only way to be
[1:05:49] an overcomer it's the only way that you
[1:05:51] can know if you are overcoming because
[1:05:54] that word Can't Fail oh brothers and
[1:05:57] sisters how do we how do we overcome by
[1:05:59] the word
[1:06:02] notice again how Jesus overcame the
[1:06:04] World Systems of religion when he was
[1:06:06] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[1:06:08] of his day
[1:06:10] there it is badgered you feel bad I feel
[1:06:12] badgered more in the last couple of
[1:06:14] years than I've ever felt badger by the
[1:06:16] theologians of the day by those who need
[1:06:18] proof by those who need vindication
[1:06:21] I feel badgered by that they're picking
[1:06:24] on me
[1:06:25] I just want to get out of here these
[1:06:26] unbelievers keep picking on me that
[1:06:29] ain't why I want to go home
[1:06:30] I want to go home because I'm allowed to
[1:06:32] fulfill the word in my bay
[1:06:34] Oh my he constantly applied the word he
[1:06:38] spake only what the father gave him to
[1:06:39] speak there was not a time when the
[1:06:41] world was not utterly confused by his
[1:06:43] wisdom for it was the wisdom of God and
[1:06:45] this last statement out of that church
[1:06:47] age book in his own personal life look
[1:06:50] at those next words contending with
[1:06:52] himself
[1:06:54] I could just fold it up and go home on
[1:06:56] that one how many ever contended with
[1:06:58] herself
[1:07:00] he was talking about looking at the
[1:07:02] worst enemy in the mirror the other
[1:07:03] night we save him every day in his own
[1:07:06] personal life contending with himself he
[1:07:10] overcame by obedience to the word of God
[1:07:13] oh brothers and sisters well you know
[1:07:15] where your worst contention is in the
[1:07:17] mirror right
[1:07:18] contending with yourself
[1:07:21] well you just don't know that sister
[1:07:23] over there she just don't like me and
[1:07:24] I'm contending with that that ain't as
[1:07:26] much as contending with your own self
[1:07:28] that's nothing we let these little
[1:07:31] little things of Life bother us
[1:07:34] I mean I have a lot of trouble when I'm
[1:07:35] around by the way and I think well it's
[1:07:37] hard to contend with brother Wade
[1:07:39] but then he near as rough as continuing
[1:07:41] with myself that's right it's almost as
[1:07:43] bad but not quite you know
[1:07:46] ain't nothing in this world where your
[1:07:48] battle is right it's right here the
[1:07:51] greatest battle ever fought oh my
[1:07:54] brothers and sisters this word is here
[1:07:55] to do it I'm running out of time I I was
[1:07:58] going to go into Satan's seat one day
[1:08:00] we'll maybe get back here and do that
[1:08:01] brother Brandon said Satan's seed had
[1:08:03] had changed over to be to be pertimist
[1:08:07] it used to be in Babylon now it's permas
[1:08:09] and then he shifted his seat back again
[1:08:11] to Babylon but only this time it's not a
[1:08:14] natural Babylon over there in Iran or
[1:08:16] somewhere you know where it is it's
[1:08:18] mystery Babylon mystery Babylon that's
[1:08:21] where it is all brothers and sisters is
[1:08:24] it rough in this age sure it is
[1:08:26] is it bad sure it is are we going to
[1:08:29] have a squeeze sure we are
[1:08:31] right oh no it's going to be a mental
[1:08:33] squeeze really yeah really come on
[1:08:36] I have mental pressure right and we all
[1:08:38] got I I preached in a man's church one
[1:08:40] time the very next week I know brother
[1:08:42] Tommy said we're going to have
[1:08:43] persecution and tough times and trials
[1:08:46] but I've already I just want you to know
[1:08:48] I've already been mentally squeezed
[1:08:51] I cannot read those quotes about the
[1:08:53] squeeze
[1:08:54] and think brother Brandon was talking
[1:08:56] about a mental squeeze
[1:08:58] come on when he makes statements about
[1:09:02] you that have followed the pillar of
[1:09:03] fire you're going to have a rough time
[1:09:05] of it then he wasn't talking mental
[1:09:08] there's something coming I don't know
[1:09:10] how it's going to get put in I don't
[1:09:12] know if it's going to come under the
[1:09:13] reign of Obama or not I just don't know
[1:09:16] but there is coming a time where this
[1:09:18] but the promise is you go back to all of
[1:09:21] those quotes when he talked about that
[1:09:22] persecution and that stress you know
[1:09:24] what he almost always followed it up
[1:09:26] with watch that third pull then watch
[1:09:29] that word hold you then the way that it
[1:09:31] has held you now
[1:09:32] brothers and sisters we're going to go
[1:09:34] out of here continuing with ourselves
[1:09:35] more than anybody else
[1:09:37] and there is power in this word and
[1:09:40] contending with his own self he overcame
[1:09:43] by obedience to the word you got some
[1:09:45] stress in your life follow obedience to
[1:09:48] this word and it'll take care of that
[1:09:50] stress you having a problem it's not an
[1:09:52] outward problem it's right here inside
[1:09:55] of this building let's stand to our feet

[1:10:05] Satan's seed is
[1:10:07] right there in pergamas where the
[1:10:09] scripture calls it Satan's seat exactly
[1:10:12] but right in there
