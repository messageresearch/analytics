TRANSCRIPT
========================================
always preaching Wednesday remember that and also this Saturday the Bible study or question answers send your questions to brother Wade or bring them with you and then next Sunday after second service is Sister Dale's birthday party and then also communion Second Sunday this month okay and brother Joe if y'all can get the PowerPoint connected I'm not sure if it's if I did everything right here to make it work there it is okay and then we're gonna go ahead and open repair again for this just for the Sunday School lesson here father would probably just bless this lesson what would you know how I've told over this to try to prepare it for your people or to pray you let it be a blessing to them just help them and just help me to just take it slow and easy and just just teach you the best that I can I want to pray and let it be a blessing to your people in Jesus name amen this morning I want to talk about the Statue of perfect man I don't like to kind of get off the beaten path you know what's being preached and being taught whenever I'm asked to teach I'm a substitute so you know I just don't want to get everybody in mind wandering away from from what we're being taught right now so brother Wade he's been on the Statue of perfect man been talking about um uh the son of man who is the son of man such a perfect man brother bald's been on faith and in the book of Hebrews chapter 11. talk about Vindicated life the life that's in the blood and Cain and Abel about them making choices and all that so we're going to try to stay right along on those same paths talking about the life of God the statue of perfect man coming and being manifested in our lives individually and um so a quick little uh something that helps me understand this kind of like this I'm going to do a comparison of the Lord himself uh with this statue of man because it's the statue of Christ it's his own stature it's his own attributes or his own characteristics so if you take like any person you could take any one of you or any or me and and say like if you wanted to be like one person I know better than I know anybody is my wife so I'll just use her for an example if you say Ryan how would I be like Gabby and then I'd say well first of all you got to be real bashful if I want to talk about the Statue of Gabby I want to say you need to be backward in bashful very meticulous because all these years that I've known her every little project or craft I see her do she's so meticulous she'll work at it for hours and hours and hours on these little crafts and things so you got to be meticulous and pay attention to detail and then you got to be patient because I'm not patient enough to spend hours on a project like that but if you're going to be a gabby you got to be patient and those are just a few of the things that we could go with each person individually here and name some of your characteristics some of the things that you're born with it's just part of your who you are and this is the character of Christ this is who he is and this is uh basically him saying be perfect here's how we'll get to that slide here in a minute so that's the best that basically that I understand the stature perfect man is these are the characteristics of the Lord himself okay Jesus first comment was overlooked by many people because they were not looking for him correctly according to the way the Bible said he would come he comes to those who are really looking for him correctly according to the scripture he came the first time just as he would as he said he would he's come the second time in his bride so that's where we look for him in the bride first John 4 hereby know we the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and you know by the way he's been talking about the son of man John 1 and begin with the word with God Word was God now the word made flesh God Among Us it was in Christ but now it's in us and that's what he's been putting all the emphasis on is that that word has been made flesh in US so we're being we should start to see these characteristics in the stature perfect man reflected in our own life behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him so we'll have his characteristics for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure so as I said we're doing a comparison of his life and the statue perfect man okay there's this is a like an endless subject this is not something you can cover in a 30-minute lesson so I'm just going to kind of take some of the examples that stand out to me that put on display that stature perfect man and the life of the Lord himself because it's it's not hard to find a lot of examples second Peter according to the divine power given unto us let's just go and Skip on down verse five and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and the temperance patience into patience godliness and regardless brotherly kindness and in brotherly kindness charity if these things being unabound they make you that you shouldn't either be bare nor unfruitful in the knowledge it doesn't say virtue difference and all that it says knowledge right there so it must be talking about the whole scope this is knowing the Lord what I'll say in the beginning talk about I know my wife Gabby and I know her stature I know her characteristics This Is Us no one coming to know the Lord and knowing his stature his characteristics and it being made alive in us manifested in US nor approval and then knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things as blind cannot see it far off and hath forgotten that he was purred from his old sins or for the rather brethrenic diligence that you make your calling and elections sure for if you do these things you should never fall there's so many interest shall be Minister unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Matthew 5 this is some of the things again that you'll do if you have the character of Christ this is him on display but I say unto you uh we're going to skip down in verse 44. I know it's really small it says 44 is about halfway down I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and that's not natural human nature to do that this is all contrary to Human Nature pray for them I should spitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven before you make the sun to rise on the evil and on the good sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even Republicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect so as I said a minute ago he's saying be perfect here's how this is the statue of perfect man talking about the Statue of Our Lord and it's there's a lot of detail on this let's uh define stature quality or status gained by growth development or achievement so it just basically means growing up it basically means coming to maturity and while I was looking it up I stole it down beneath this um that definition there Google was it said what is the spiritual meaning of stature spiritual stature is a product of the molding hands of the Potter upon the clay it is the molding hand of God that produces stature with God it comes from our obedient responses to God's dealings in our life and it is usually accompanied with much pain and suffering so that was from Google thanks Google I didn't see that one coming that was uh unexpected a little nugget there somebody posted that on there if you can get that get that point to understand this is uh brother Dale from 2019 uh September 15th if you can get that point to understand what faith really is then it'll be easy to be able to say add virtue because it's the same material all right it's not a different material it's the same material added to it virtue and knowledge would be the same material Temperance patients calling us and all be the same material okay so you're not having to try to figure out so if you just ever find out what faith really is and get that and you're understanding then you'll see what these virtues really are it's just adding Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith or Revelation Revelation opening God's word to each one of us that's God and simplicity there's nothing hard about this it's I know it I just read on the previous slide there's pain and suffering that comes with it all these trials we go through are part of it but God always gives us Grace to overcome he never puts on us more than we can stand that's all part of it and but it's not something so great that we can't attain to it okay it's not something's out of our reach it's in the reach of every one of us I think I just yeah this one's from yeah next one here this one's from Brother Bob about a year ago April last year as the word is revealed to you your life begins to change as you partake of the word he's claiming you he's actually taking possession of you he's claiming your life until he caps off everything that he's claimed with the headstone he caps off your possession what is it every word that you hear and receive it's like God putting a little flag over you saying this is mine this is mine and when he claims it it's not going back when he claims your soul it can't go back when it adds virtue it can't go back when he has knowledge it can't go back it'll never be taken away and claims your life and it's now under his possession he's putting that little flag over you saying this is mine now this is why the Bible I believe Solomon Chapter 2 says he brought me to the banqueting house the place where I'm going to eat to sit down and at the table and His Banner his little flag over me was love he's claiming me as I eat the word both of them basically just said the same thing you're eating the word you're becoming the word did you eat the word this is a daily like brothers was saying Wednesday night just to mundane so it is kind of mundane to our flesh it's not entertaining to sit down and read the Bible if you roll beside me in the chicken truck you could be bored stiff all I do is drive and listen to sermons and drive and listen to sermons you would be like banging your head against the wall my life is incredibly boring sometimes okay but you're gonna see a little nugget on that if you didn't see it Wednesday night I got another little example that goes along with that here in the Lord's life Luke 2 this is the Amplified version he went down to Nazareth with them and was continually submissive and obedient to them and his mother treasured all these things in her heart and Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and in stature by most natural proof of man in stature he kept growing and in favor with God and Men so let me back up to that Jesus did not need salvation as I said last time I'm talking about that in great drama this is all a great drama and he's acting it out he's a he's a character in his own play okay he didn't need salvation but he came and played the role he acted it out of what it takes to be a baby and then come through life through struggles and then come to consecrate yourself to Christ at a very young age is what he did and then growing in Grace and knowledge and the encounter status man and then come into a Ministry or whatever God has for you to do in in life and you know and just going out to living out this whole entire Earth Journey he was a character in his own play and not that he needed salvation but he just acted it out for us to show us what to do he was our example he was never lost he was born in Jehovah so Hebrews 5 so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but that he said unto him Thou Art my sons today by begotten thee he said also another place thou the priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from Death was hurt and that he feared though we were son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation he's writing that play as he lived it out on Earth he's he's writing this great drama and writing himself into it and writing our part into it author of Eternal salvation of them that obey him called of God in high priest I have to order Melchizedek in John 10 the Jews answered I'm saying for good works don't we not but for blasphemy because that thou being a man maketh not a self God Jesus answered him is not written in your law I said you are Gods so he's the one that said that it's in the law of God you are Gods if he called them gods to the word of God came to and scripture cannot be broken save him whom the father is Sanctified and sent to the world without Blasphemous because I said I am the son of God hope one of that one quoted there is just to say that the scripture shows you are Gods that's God becoming one with flesh again first John 4 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits where they are of God because many false prophets gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ is come in the flesh as I've gone and every Spirit confesses not that Jesus Christ come to the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherever you've heard it should come and even now is already in the world okay so word being made flesh now as this is a picture of the two the disciples on the road to Emmaus this is after death burial and resurrection of the Lord and he appeared to them as they were walking and talking about the Lord that's where he always comes around when you're worshiping him he inhabits your Praises when you talk about him think about him meditate on his word and anything you do that's spending time with the Lord reading his word or whatever he comes around he's always faithful to do that and as it appointed to man wants to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation this is one of many examples but the disciples on the road to Emmaus they were actually you know disheartened or they were down downtrodden whatever you want to say they weren't talking about him maybe in good way they're kind of disappointed but yet they were talking about them and he came around but there's many other examples you can give in the scripture where the disciples or someone would be talking about him then here he'd come around so he comes to those who are looking for him that's my point if you're really looking for him and living a life that's consecrated to him and really closely looking for him in the Bible and the message in your own life you'll see him the statue perfect man if you take uh well if you take us that's nothing but a wild Gore and not head C I'll skip on down uh see because I got too many goals to get to here Christ's Faith was not based on those Pharisees Saturday season and their pots kettles or pans they're watching it's based on the word of God so much until Christ was the word the word was made flesh and then when we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking our faith becomes a genuine Faith Hallelujah then the Life of Christ is transfused into us we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit consented radiant blessings down through there and we're in the stature of Christ so that's how that happens we get in Christ and now we put on the uh put the blood of Jesus Christ and see that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge now he says blood here we're talking about blood the life is in the blood that's what brother Bob's been teaching on in Sunday school the life in the blood the knowledge Jesus Christ the Timbers of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he is the head that controls you and your feet is the foundation he man control by the head that's the stature of as the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues so let's go back to the life of Jesus when he was at 12. it's interesting the Bible would make a note to make it a point to mention that because you know the rest of that time of him growing up is what we call the silent years you don't see much of anything any account of him in the scripture but for some reason it mentions him at 12 and what's he doing he's all about the father's business he's in the temple with the uh you know the scribes the teachers basically just say discussing the word of God because he was all about the father's business even at that very young age it's what we call the age of accountability it may not be a defined age per se at exactly 12 it could be 10 11 12 13 some are long in there but when at this stage in life when a person recognizes they are a moral agent and have the ability to choose right and wrong okay no longer what Mom and Daddy tell you right and wrong about get your hand out of the cookie jar don't cross the road without us holding your hand or whatever this comes to a new level when when your conscience sort of awakens to the realization that you are a moral being and you can make right and wrong choices moral right and wrong choices and then that's the age where you can first really sincerely give your heart to the Lord because you begin to realize you're a sinner needs salvation what's our Lord doing he's so consecrated to God that he's discussing the word with these seasoned you know scribes and Pharisees and whatever all was there he's he's all about the father's business from a very young age and you'll see now how that spawns this growth for these silent years that you don't hear of him again from 12 to 29 and a half you don't hear much of anything of him but those are growth happening in there okay there had to be because that's that's what he was living out he was portraying that part of a Christian Living their life and daily just doing his carpenter work and taking his lunch box under his arm to work and meditating on the scripture in Luke 252 and Jesus increased in wisdom and his stature in favor with God and man so here you see a picture of maybe what he might have looked like a little bit older still about the father's business it didn't just show up at the River Jordan just died one day on so I'll be baptized I think this would be a good place good time to be baptized I know there was a whole long time of a life consecrated Christ leading up or consecrated to the Lord leading up to that point okay it wasn't just overnight he just decided that one day so this is from uh brother Louise Wednesday night through our ups and downs God is molding these virtues in our hearts and lives through our mundane task of life it didn't take a shouting service to give you knowledge it didn't take a shouting service to give you patience it didn't take for a brother to lay hands on you amen give you godliness it's through the daily routine of coming to church going to work dealing with people talking with people doing my wife I hope he didn't get in trouble for saying that dealing with my daughters dealing with her children cleaning dirty diapers folding clothes amen doing all that and now you get all it and in this mundane in these mundane things so we need those mundane things we need our daily life it's a supernatural thing that's happening but it happens just on our day-to-day life as you do your chores around the house or go work with your lunchbox on your arm and make the best of them the joy of the Lord is in my strength and in the mundane routine things you know the things of this life it's all about mundane routines and repetitions nothing that's why the Bible says that he is the same yesterday the day and forever that's the foreman right there makes great things happen he never changes so we know always need to the dramatic we don't always need to see dramatic things and in our life get well acquainted with the mundane of your life and say Lord how can I reflect the kingdom of God in this that I'm doing because I just don't see it but help me to see it amen so here's Jesus a little bit older and what's he doing he's burning the midnight oil so to speak staying up reading the scripture in the Old Testament Scrolls and studying the word of God becoming acquainted with that Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and Faith we're gone so these Jesus I said here is in the silent years Daily Grind mundane life quietly growing in Grace and knowledge at some point he took on and worked with his um Earthly dad will say Joseph and did the carpenter work and so forth but he still kept growing in Grace and knowledge no doubt staying up late reading the Scrolls because he maybe had such a full day's work he couldn't get to it that day so he if you don't find time for God you have to make time for God okay that's a lesson I learned when I was 15 years old and I said I can't find time when I make time to read my Bible every day I don't care what it takes then here's Jesus all of a sudden come to be baptized well as I said that was a long life of Consecration and leading up to that didn't just happen overnight Matthew 4 then was Jesus led up of the spirit of the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil now here's where you see some of this uh statue of man that's now come into him he's developed he's grown up into the stature and now it begins to be tested immediately after he's baptized he goes to the Wilderness to be tempted and tried or into the desert and when it fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was outward hunger and when the temperature came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stars but me they may be made bread by the answer instead of not is it not it is written man should not live I've read alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so he had knowledge to know what to do with the word of God he had Temperance self-control all of a sudden all these attributes started to come into display he had um or the virtues he had patience to wait on God his natural body was hungered all of a sudden but now he's he's already come to this stature of a perfect man and he can he can handle these trials and temptations Matthew 4 then the devil takes them up to the holy city instead of them on a pinnacle of the temple and saith in him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for his written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee in their hands they shall bear the opposite any time thou bash left foot against the stone Jesus said unto them it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God he knew what was to be done with the word he had knowledge to know how to handle the word and he knew that he's not the clown around for the devil not to make a not to be made a puppet or something again the devil take him up to a seating high mountain and show them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and say to him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get the hint Satan for his written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God him only shall thou serve and the devil leaveth him and behold the angels can Minister unto him so again he knew what to do there he had all these virtues to know how to handle that situation in John 2 I'm just I'm not going to read the whole thing y'all know what's happening in the uh Temple he went to cast out the money changers turn over the money changers tables and cast them out because they made his father's house the house of merchandise but one scripture this one here is in John 2 points out that he planted a court of ropes you know he didn't just all of a sudden just lash out at him he had sat there and meditated this this was channeled and uh not something just sporadically he just lost his temper no it was very intentional and he was in full self-control of what was happening there then we find him many other examples between here and there but when we finally get to his Garden of Gethsemane experience as brother Aaron preached a while back he made his petition known he said Lord I would that this father what this cup passed for me that was his own desire he said I'm just asking you at this past me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he surrendered his own will to the father and said I'll do whatever you say if this is your will so that showed self-control it showed patience and showed a submission and all those things to the to the father's will godliness and then first Peter 2. this is all talking about where he was being mocked and being basically tortured uh beat right before the um crucifixion and throughout all of this punishment that he bore for our sins at the very last months of his life he was asking them and they would come to the place which is called Calvary and there they crucified him the malfeiters on the one hand on the and then on the other on the left then Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they're doing that is the very epitome the embodiment of all those things he talked about earlier on about us being perfect and coming to this full growth of stature perfect man he was all of that embodied there and on display because the people who are torturing him killing him mocking him and betraying him and all those things he prayed for them and loved them despite all that statue of perfect man we're not the building organization I might hear this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse The Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word so you build up the individual to that place now build an organization but build the individuals Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea uh you musician musicians can go ahead and come up and I think I'm gonna have to close right there let's see and now we've put the blood of Jesus Christ in and see that brings the faith of Jesus Christ I already read that I remember reading that sorry I'm going to skip down about halfway down this one he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're feeding you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man okay I'm gonna stop right there God bless you all [Applause] [Music] thank you
