[10:35] in Jesus name Amen
[10:38] 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified
[10:44] your souls in obeying the truth through
[10:46] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[10:49] Brethren thee that you love one another
[10:51] with a pure heart fervently they what a
[10:54] lot of people wonderful why do you use
[10:56] that same scripture that because we're
[10:58] still on the same thought it doesn't
[11:01] matter if it's 20 sermons to me or 40
[11:04] sermons and that same talk if I keep it
[11:07] then that's what goes yours I thought
[11:09] being born again not of corruptible seed
[11:12] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[11:15] which liveth and abideth for ever
[11:19] okay Romans 11 I want you to notice this
[11:26] point and then we'll bring our point
[11:28] we'll go to verse 25 or I would not
[11:32] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[11:34] this mystery unless you should be wise
[11:37] in your own conceits that blindness in
[11:41] part is happened to Israel until the
[11:45] fullness of the Gentiles be come in now
[11:47] remember Israel is blinded for our sake
[11:50] all right and there they can't come in
[11:54] until we get out of the way so they're
[11:56] blinded for that but now what's a
[11:58] blinded people and what's what the point
[12:01] is and so shall all Israel be saved
[12:05] there's going to be a group of people
[12:08] fills you that are going to be saved
[12:11] and they are saved down through the time
[12:13] and they didn't accept Jesus Christ what
[12:19] I mean they've died down through time
[12:21] the field stills you from Calvary up to
[12:24] now that feels feels used I'd not
[12:27] accepting Jesus Christ
[12:28] we'll look what he says about him and so
[12:31] all Israel shall be saved
[12:34] he's gonna save a group of people that
[12:36] don't even accept him don't do anything
[12:38] and what's your conclusion now there
[12:43] shall come out of Zion
[12:45] remember that's out of the bride Isaiah
[12:48] says what is it one of them is out of
[12:51] the bride two other ones in all right
[12:55] they're still come out of Zion the
[12:57] deliverer and shall turn away
[12:58] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[13:01] covenant unto them when I shall take
[13:05] away their sins future times are coming
[13:07] on all the way through as concerning the
[13:10] gospel they are enemies for your sakes
[13:14] but as touching the election they are
[13:17] beloved of the father's sake for the
[13:20] father's things for the gifts and
[13:22] calling
[13:22] of God are without repentance you may be
[13:27] seated to the Lord at his blessing to
[13:29] the reading of the word gift and calling
[13:32] or without repentance we're gonna try to
[13:35] pick up our thought from where we left
[13:38] off this morning but I want to read you
[13:41] something remember what our in talking
[13:45] was about that we are a wonderful
[13:49] blessed people that if we need to know
[13:53] something about the Bible you know what
[13:57] a scripture means etc we just go to the
[14:01] message of the hour it ain't like we
[14:04] used to well we'll go down and see what
[14:06] dr. so-and-so says about it we'll go see
[14:08] what this says about it you know no we
[14:11] go to the message of the hour to find
[14:14] the answers to our questions all right
[14:17] that's a wonderful opportunity because
[14:20] see there are a lot of people with a lot
[14:22] of questions all right there's a lot of
[14:25] things that questions but they don't
[14:27] have no way of getting an answer because
[14:29] they have no thing and we know the
[14:33] Prophet is not infallible I mean he you
[14:38] know he he can do wrong he could he said
[14:41] things that was wrong he taught things
[14:43] that was wrong with any corrected it and
[14:46] all like that but the message that he
[14:49] brought when you take it straight down
[14:52] through the line it's infallible
[14:55] it's totally pure I may have them words
[14:58] all messed up of what it is but I just
[15:01] simply mean this message any question
[15:04] you have any thought you asked go to the
[15:08] message and find out that's why on the
[15:11] Internet I will not answer any questions
[15:14] of people on the internet because you're
[15:16] just gonna get into an argument you know
[15:19] arguably about and I'm not gonna do that
[15:21] I tell the brothers is to tell it
[15:25] brother Joe sends back a notice go to
[15:29] your pastor because he's responsible I'm
[15:32] not if you don't have a faster go
[15:35] straight to the message
[15:37] you know cause what else can you say we
[15:41] have the ability to you're from God by
[15:50] way of a message that the messengers
[15:53] died and going on he's been buried he's
[15:55] in everything you know but we have the
[15:58] message thank God for technology to
[16:03] where that we can have the message to be
[16:05] able to search though we used to sin I
[16:07] mean we'd spend sometimes I would be
[16:10] studying for a sermon I'd spend more
[16:12] time trying to find a quote from the
[16:14] Prophet just one little quote then you
[16:18] know back in the old days then I would
[16:20] even try to get the sermon together so
[16:23] you to find something that the Prophet
[16:25] said on that talk now it's the instant
[16:27] you just pull it in this instant I mean
[16:29] that's that's wonderful you say well how
[16:33] do we know well we've got the right
[16:34] answer now let me describe better setup
[16:38] into a point you're not going to pull up
[16:44] and try to get the answer and just have
[16:46] a great big thing but you're gonna get a
[16:48] statement well then see if brother
[16:50] Branham says over here there's just one
[16:53] true and living God there's no such
[16:57] thing as a Trinity etc etc all right
[17:00] then when you come over here somewhere
[17:02] and you find some wording that sounds
[17:05] like he's saying something about a
[17:06] Trinity so you know your answer has
[17:08] already been stated because remember
[17:11] what he will be saying we'll come into
[17:14] the truth if given an opportunity I've
[17:18] seen a lot of things that I thought was
[17:19] totally contrary into tonight statements
[17:22] the Prophet would make haven't you we'll
[17:25] give it time to come find out it's a in
[17:27] the same time a little different form
[17:30] little different wording but saying the
[17:32] same point cuz there's only one truth
[17:34] now we're not looking through a message
[17:36] to find a half a dozen truth we look to
[17:40] the message to find the truth see a
[17:43] truth is fine that's good but the truth
[17:48] is what I want
[17:49] see in that bin that but do we put
[17:53] everything we've got is our whole life
[17:57] and everything set on this prophets
[18:01] message so not on the message and the
[18:04] messenger the man the things you know he
[18:06] was a human being he was all the things
[18:08] my whole thing is not based upon his
[18:11] life and his living in different time
[18:14] it's not on there it's based on the
[18:17] message that he brought because he had
[18:20] to link to the to God to bring it down
[18:22] to us Oh No see then I don't have to
[18:27] worry about it I just sometimes I may
[18:29] have to wait on the answer you know
[18:32] cause I'd like I said I've seen a lot of
[18:34] things that look on through it here to
[18:35] here but you wait a while and you'll
[18:37] find out the truth is there that's the
[18:40] way that I put my confidence into the
[18:43] message and then it goes back from Daraa
[18:45] to saying well the Prophet says this
[18:48] this this the Bible the Prophet can't
[18:53] say something contrary to the Bible as a
[18:57] human element he may make a statement a
[18:59] kin a statement or something but he
[19:02] cannot be contrary to the Bible so if
[19:04] the Bible and the prophets message says
[19:06] something we're supposed to believe it
[19:11] yeah but I'm just no no no we have not
[19:14] one iota of a thought of any form other
[19:17] than to accept the Word of God now
[19:21] that's been my stole oh it's been my
[19:23] thing all the way through you know to
[19:27] stay on that one time this message has
[19:30] ever answer that we need answered
[19:35] sometimes we don't need to be answered
[19:38] in maybe all right but for what we have
[19:42] need of this message has the answer well
[19:45] I was in Greer's almanac the other day
[19:47] and I was reading and the Lord showed me
[19:49] sup well that's good but Greer's almanac
[19:52] didn't bring you the right dollar it
[19:54] just maybe had words that opened up some
[19:57] channel that God had already planted a
[19:59] seed to do in your hearts and lives but
[20:02] do we believe
[20:04] do we believe what the Prophet said he
[20:08] said we know now you're trying to say
[20:09] something
[20:10] exactly right then we know now you got
[20:14] something in mind that you're not
[20:15] something right it's exactly right what
[20:18] do we believe the message is right do we
[20:26] believe what he says to be true I gave
[20:31] him one of these but I got a couple of
[20:33] it go ahead and pull up the one I gave
[20:35] you got a couple more and look what the
[20:42] prophet has to say off of the message
[20:45] you're his voice but we modern Americans
[20:51] what we and the false prophets behind
[20:54] the pulpit say that's all right I'm kind
[20:58] of notion of saying they worship you get
[21:01] what he's saying and the false prophets
[21:04] behind the pulpit say that's all right
[21:07] so you know that what are we supposed to
[21:09] depend on the false prophets or what
[21:12] then he says look I'm kind of a notion
[21:15] of saying that if I'm wrong God forgive
[21:17] me so he's gonna make a strong statement
[21:19] so listen I'm persuaded that a lot of
[21:23] them don't know God talking about the
[21:26] ministers and the signs right they don't
[21:28] know God look the congregation will
[21:32] never live any higher than its pastor do
[21:41] you believe that
[21:46] these some of you looking at me some of
[21:49] you said in stone-faced some of you
[21:50] ain't moving a muscle
[21:54] think about it the congregation will
[21:59] never live any higher now he's referring
[22:01] to the false prophets and the way
[22:04] they're lewin and all right and makes
[22:07] that statement now here's another one I
[22:09] didn't give to him but this is off the
[22:12] Pergamon Church age the church and the
[22:15] priest in 1960 talked about the hidden
[22:18] manna the little something special what
[22:21] is the special not something to the
[22:23] blessings of the Holy Ghost don't know
[22:24] no that's for the whole congregation but
[22:28] the hidden manna was a special
[22:30] revelation because he had to teach the
[22:32] others he was a little more knowledge of
[22:37] the scripture that he could teach the
[22:40] others now listen he's supposed to be is
[22:46] that right
[22:47] you'll never live any higher than your
[22:50] pasture you just remember that because
[22:55] he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's
[22:58] the Shepherd right cuz I've always told
[23:04] you that a lot of people I don't I
[23:05] wouldn't call my pastor God I don't
[23:08] agree with him in the word you know the
[23:11] word is the pastor anyway all right so
[23:15] what is he saying you'll never live no
[23:18] higher than your passenger you just
[23:20] remember that because he's the Shepherd
[23:21] that feeds you if he's this effort you
[23:25] got to know where the miner is to feed
[23:26] the sheep that was he's got to know
[23:28] where the man I hit I look at this from
[23:30] questions and answers
[23:32] while having a shadow we believe in God
[23:36] in church government the government is
[23:39] ordered of the Holy Spirit in the Bible
[23:42] the pastor is always the head of the
[23:45] church the pastor is always that's God's
[23:49] elder in organization you have to come
[23:52] through the bishop oh yeah okay they're
[23:56] getting them here
[23:59] there's no higher order in the Bible
[24:02] than the elder of the church tell me
[24:05] where it's at
[24:06] there's no higher order in the Bible for
[24:09] the church than the elder which is the
[24:12] pastor and he's the highest order of the
[24:16] Bible what no no you say well brother
[24:22] Dale I got that straightened down
[24:25] brother branham's my pastor okay he said
[24:35] brother branham's my pastor well you
[24:41] gonna have to argue with him what he's
[24:43] talking about money so I ain't gonna
[24:45] worry about it that's why I don't try to
[24:49] rule nothing I try to direct us and keep
[24:55] us in order and got it cuz of the truth
[24:57] because we believe what the Prophet said
[25:00] it me now it does not mean when he says
[25:05] that there's not a higher order than the
[25:07] pastor it doesn't mean listen it doesn't
[25:11] mean that you don't know intellectually
[25:14] more than your pastor because you're in
[25:17] bad shape if you don't know more than I
[25:19] do
[25:19] intellectually it didn't say that he's
[25:26] not talking about head knowledge he's
[25:30] talking about Holy Ghost knowledge head
[25:32] knowledge can't lead a church now let me
[25:34] make the statement and you won't do it's
[25:35] going to many churches have you been
[25:37] split because they seem split because of
[25:39] head knowledge but Holy Ghost knowledge
[25:49] labraina church together all right now
[25:52] there's the things we will be reading
[25:54] and we'll be walking from the order and
[25:57] keeping it in that line I am NOT trying
[26:02] in in no way to make you line up for my
[26:11] ideas and thoughts
[26:13] I've never had no idea that it's whether
[26:17] or not you agree with the word it's not
[26:20] whether or not you agree with me I'm
[26:23] like brother branham he said I don't
[26:25] want a yes-man that behind me in other
[26:29] words is cutting me from the back I've
[26:31] had him to do it oh brother Dale ain't
[26:34] none greater than brother Dale he's he's
[26:36] the greatest we've got there and in them
[26:38] you feel that knife cutting through and
[26:41] you realize that hey wait a minute
[26:43] they're not they must not mean it all
[26:46] right but listen you say that's a funny
[26:49] way to approach what you want approach
[26:52] car don't approach the idea of the fifo
[26:55] ministry all right we have had a message
[27:02] we have brought the Prophet brought the
[27:05] message thank God for the technology to
[27:08] bring it down to us that we can search
[27:10] it and I said a moment ago that we can
[27:13] see what he's saying we can check out
[27:15] what he's saying you know thank God for
[27:18] all of that we've had all the things
[27:21] that God figures we have need of I guess
[27:24] is a way to say it put it our disposal
[27:27] to where we can follow the message all
[27:30] right that's not trying to build up the
[27:33] fivefold ministry to me you don't have
[27:36] to I tell you without any remorse or
[27:45] thought or anything whatsoever it
[27:48] doesn't matter to me what you think
[27:50] about me except for one thing it will
[27:52] determine what you are you know that
[27:57] determines what you are I'm not trying
[28:01] to make you believe me I'm trying to say
[28:04] this is what the Bible says about the
[28:08] fivefold ministry what the Prophet says
[28:11] about the fivefold ministry and then
[28:14] it's left into your hands what to do
[28:16] about it
[28:17] all right see then that way I'm not
[28:20] trying to straighten out this or produce
[28:23] this idea you know well the people are
[28:25] just not on
[28:26] mean and this that and the other you
[28:28] know and I'll use for pulpit against
[28:29] that having helped me I'll quit today
[28:31] when that comes into view because
[28:35] there's never been no such thing because
[28:38] you're going to find out before we
[28:39] finish this that your prophet said it's
[28:43] not the preacher that's doing the
[28:44] preaching he said it's God that's doing
[28:47] the preaching you see you ever take a
[28:51] lot of reading well if that ain't
[28:54] according to the word then it ain't God
[28:56] preaching through the person I don't
[28:57] care who it is that solves that problem
[28:59] you know I mean we're to have enough
[29:02] sense to know you say well these
[29:04] preachers out here say God leading them
[29:06] and they're preaching Trinity and they
[29:09] even give you signs and wonders to back
[29:10] up what they're talking about how when
[29:13] it's not true
[29:15] so they can't be telling the truth
[29:18] right because it ain't according to the
[29:21] world what I want to do is approach that
[29:24] fight for ministry by the thoughts of
[29:26] the world of what it says about it and
[29:28] then leave you with with whatever you
[29:31] want to do cuz that's not not my problem
[29:35] that's yours
[29:36] alright see so I wrote it like this if
[29:42] we're required that's trying to end the
[29:45] message putting this message in between
[29:48] we'll start on the virtues the Lord
[29:50] willing Wednesday alright then asking
[29:54] the question that we're required to have
[29:56] the Bible reveal to us or whatever you
[29:59] wanna call it
[30:00] statute of perfectman adoptions and the
[30:03] time the Bible being revealed if we're
[30:05] required to how the Bible revealed to us
[30:08] then how is it to be done now we know
[30:15] for surety that the faithful ministry is
[30:19] not the ones to bring the message me are
[30:25] you in there and if Ifill ministers not
[30:27] the ones bringing the message God sent
[30:31] us a prophet to bring the message it's
[30:35] not my message
[30:37] I try to preach the truth of the Bible
[30:39] and that's brother branham's message
[30:41] he'll get the honor and glory from
[30:43] because he brought the message unto us
[30:47] but whatever you do with the line and
[30:49] the channel that goes between between
[30:51] you and God and that's the way he'll
[30:54] honor it called brother Brennan says you
[30:56] honor the gift God will honor you see
[31:01] that's what I want to make sure that we
[31:03] understand so I'm going to make the
[31:07] statement while you wait enough to
[31:09] listen to it and put it hard and strong
[31:12] there's an entirely difference between
[31:15] the Prophet could fulfill all the
[31:17] offices but Ryan could fulfill all of
[31:20] the five ministry offices all right
[31:23] he did because he was pastor he was this
[31:25] he was that he could do all of that all
[31:28] right but he's the only one that could
[31:30] do because you can't cross gifts no I'm
[31:35] not quoting the Prophet you you can't
[31:36] cross gifts if you're a pastor be a
[31:39] pastor I can't stand that to wear that
[31:42] you got to pastors of the church and
[31:45] they're going 50 75 percent of the time
[31:48] from their church I've never done that
[31:52] when I was coming up so he's shorter
[31:56] know what I'm 78 I'm not gonna start it
[31:58] now you know I've always stayed with the
[32:02] church and very rarely missed any
[32:06] service whatsoever because I've always
[32:09] either been you know here with somebody
[32:12] else preaching or preaching themself
[32:14] because I believe in that I don't
[32:18] believe that the pastors or to be out
[32:19] running and preaching like everything
[32:22] there's nothing wrong with a pastor
[32:23] going somewhere preaching services or
[32:26] something or preacher convention or
[32:28] preach some things you know that's
[32:30] nothing wrong with it because that's
[32:33] fine within the other parts time you
[32:36] ought to be with his own church teaching
[32:37] these people and you'll see that's why a
[32:40] lot of people leave churches right
[32:45] because their pastor is not never around
[32:48] you know that's just his honesty I can
[32:51] be if it's required that we have the
[32:55] virtues we must find the channel whereby
[32:59] they are to come then walk in that
[33:05] channel to let God unfold the things
[33:08] unto us did you catch what I'm saying if
[33:12] we are supposed to have the virtues God
[33:14] has already supplied everything he
[33:19] brought us a prophet to bring the
[33:21] message that was what was ending up this
[33:23] morning talking about Malachi for
[33:25] Malachi force to do two things one
[33:28] turned the hearts of children back to
[33:29] the faith of the father to reveal the
[33:31] seven thunders which is a revelation
[33:33] detained in the seven seals it'll be
[33:35] these divinely revealed truths that
[33:36] literally turn our hearts back okay we
[33:39] got that settled the Prophet come to
[33:42] bring those things all right he brought
[33:44] the opening of the word he brought the
[33:47] restoration of back to the faith of the
[33:50] fathers and then God went on into the
[33:52] message and opened up the entire things
[33:55] that were held secret from the beginning
[33:57] and let him bring those things through
[34:00] the opening of the seals all right and
[34:03] like I said this morning now you think
[34:05] what you won't
[34:06] I'm pastor I'm gonna say what as much as
[34:10] I can of what the truth is you say well
[34:12] brother Dale we agree we're about to we
[34:14] believe that thunders has been revealed
[34:17] but said we don't we don't know the new
[34:22] name all right that's the only thing you
[34:26] can argue with me about it
[34:27] because I'll show you where brother
[34:29] Brennan said all the mysteries have done
[34:30] been revealed so you know better than to
[34:33] argue the point so drop that out of your
[34:36] mind
[34:36] this message has already been brought
[34:39] there's no such thing as brother branham
[34:41] to come back and teach us a message that
[34:45] has not been taught or give us some
[34:49] secret something I don't look for that
[34:54] I'm sorry
[34:54] maybe you do you look for him to come in
[34:57] and the one thing you stop and argue
[34:59] with him about you'd say what's the new
[35:01] name of Jesus whoa
[35:05] brother branham what is the new name of
[35:08] Jesus he said maybe they would be made
[35:16] known when we get to her we see you're
[35:23] not going to put your life behind that
[35:25] statement come on is it is it true
[35:29] that's the words if you need it I'll
[35:31] find it for you maybe it'll be made
[35:33] known when we get to her because you
[35:36] don't need it here you need Redemption
[35:40] here you don't need it when you get
[35:43] beyond the curtain of time or get into
[35:45] glory
[35:45] you don't need redemption anymore see
[35:49] most people thanks brother Browning's
[35:50] got to come back and preach some secret
[35:52] mystery to change our bodies well show
[35:57] me where it's at cuz it's what I said
[36:01] you do all you want to you're gonna come
[36:03] back to one thing if we sit down and
[36:05] talk you gonna come back to one thing
[36:06] there's one thing you can argue about
[36:08] because I'm gonna quote you brother
[36:10] branham all the mysteries is now history
[36:14] there's no more mysteries you looking
[36:19] for bread around to come back and bring
[36:20] us mysteries you got a problem because
[36:24] he didn't finish his message while he
[36:26] was here then then you ain't got no
[36:28] background to hold it on so you can say
[36:30] well I'll argue well I just didn't
[36:32] watching you name it you'll be made
[36:33] known when we get there yeah I can quote
[36:36] as well as you can all right see I'm not
[36:41] trying to do I've made myself quite
[36:43] clear about the tents and the things all
[36:47] the way down the return ministry design
[36:49] they'll be after the resurrection 30 to
[36:53] 40 days according to the Prophet between
[36:58] the resurrection and the change brother
[37:02] branham could preach all across the
[37:03] country but he won't need no Jedi
[37:06] replying to flywheel
[37:09] he won't need nothing like that and
[37:12] that's what gets me is people come up
[37:14] with her ideas see well run around
[37:16] he's got how that plane well what about
[37:20] that plane brother well we got it
[37:22] sitting down yonder and said it'd take
[37:24] us two years to get it to flying you
[37:27] don't tight man don't believe brother
[37:30] Browns coming back for two years okay
[37:34] who he is what he said he just said it
[37:36] said it came fly for two years if I was
[37:40] saying that I'll tell you this away to
[37:42] not be derogatory they change that white
[37:45] horse ever so often at Mohamed's thing
[37:50] he ain't gonna have to wait on the white
[37:53] horse if he jumped out of that grave the
[37:56] horse is ready all he's got to do
[37:58] straddle and take off right if I was
[38:02] dependent upon brother Brown having to
[38:04] have an airplane that I had that our
[38:06] plane would pull out on the runway every
[38:07] day and it would fly and it would come
[38:12] back and it would be refueled to the top
[38:16] it would be reconditioned as much as I
[38:19] could do without making it too worth it
[38:21] it wouldn't work immediately I'm just
[38:23] saying that people see you listen to
[38:25] people but then when I say something I'm
[38:33] saying I believe the Prophet and what he
[38:37] says well my dependence is not upon what
[38:41] you say he says it's on what he says he
[38:45] says all right see then that away I'm
[38:49] leaving a tire okay because I believe
[38:52] see the fivefold ministry there's knows
[38:55] I said this morning then there's no
[38:57] quotes that I can find if you could find
[38:59] one I want you to give it to that it
[39:02] says that the Prophet was further
[39:03] perfecting the science
[39:05] I want scripture I want the Prophet know
[39:11] but the script
[39:14] says the fivefold ministry is for the
[39:16] perfecting the Saints the Prophet said
[39:18] the fivefold ministry for perfecting the
[39:21] science I've told you when I started
[39:26] there is no such thing as this powerful
[39:28] ministry having a message of its own no
[39:32] way the prophets already brought the
[39:35] message if you think you're gonna get
[39:38] something he didn't bring you ain't
[39:39] fivefold ministry forget it I'm playing
[39:42] to say it you're not a minister because
[39:44] you're thinking about getting something
[39:45] of your own my total dependence is upon
[39:49] this message I have no thoughts
[39:52] whatsoever to try to bring my message of
[39:54] any thoughts it's total dependent upon
[40:00] that the Prophet brought the message but
[40:03] now here is the point I believe then the
[40:08] message has been brought okay to its
[40:13] fullness by the Prophet as to what he
[40:16] was supposed to bring of Redemption
[40:19] salvations the things you know preach us
[40:22] all the way to the future home so if he
[40:26] came back what was he telling us you
[40:28] know and bring something in the
[40:29] mysteries of redemption get it he can
[40:32] preach to us he can tell us how glorious
[40:34] it is he can do all the things you can
[40:37] bring a great messages for 30 40 days
[40:40] but it won't be by salvation because
[40:44] salvation to be completed when you're
[40:46] changed right you ain't gonna need a
[40:50] message after this this message is gonna
[40:53] bring the change or somebody's I've
[40:57] missed it somewhere and I'm not trying
[41:00] to be against anybody that believes
[41:01] intent doctrines in huh no way that's
[41:05] what he used to be an older now they
[41:07] call it return ministries and all kind
[41:09] of but look at the ones that's followed
[41:11] to return ministry and see how many of
[41:14] them has fallen now but others has
[41:20] fallen to but if we believe the Prophet
[41:24] brought the message
[41:26] all right now it's in the stage of the
[41:30] fivefold ministry to take that message
[41:32] and I got it in here we're brother
[41:34] Branham said these young men will take
[41:37] this message and break it down and sweep
[41:41] it on to the coming of the Lord there's
[41:45] no greater honor in the world if you ask
[41:49] me for golf run for president of the
[41:52] United States I would tell you you were
[41:54] I mean if you guaranteed me you're the
[41:58] president of the United States all you
[42:00] got to do is walk up and say hi I ain't
[42:02] going because that'd be a degrade the
[42:06] greatest height of anything could be is
[42:10] to stand in the pulpit and declare Jesus
[42:13] Christ the same yesterday today and
[42:15] forever
[42:16] that's the greatest height that anybody
[42:18] could ever want or think about you'd be
[42:23] degrading me to ask me to do something
[42:25] like that because this it's already
[42:27] there the ministries here the Prophet
[42:30] had brought his part while we've been 50
[42:34] years why have we been 50 years since he
[42:38] left because the people hasn't caught on
[42:45] to what supposed to take place see if we
[42:50] accept I'm trying to lay it all what's
[42:53] listening we accept right around him as
[42:55] the prophet we accept him as the
[42:57] messenger of the age we accept him as
[43:00] the truth that he brought but do we
[43:03] accept him when he says that the
[43:06] ministry has to break it down do we
[43:10] accept that and see that's why I said
[43:15] every while ago I don't mind stating it
[43:17] because that's what people say
[43:19] I read the statements about your pasture
[43:21] he's ordained to lead you through and
[43:25] you say well brother wrong it's my
[43:27] pasture well you you're the one that's
[43:35] got the problem not me because he you
[43:39] can't
[43:40] a tape recorder as a pastor you can't
[43:47] have books is he a pastor you say well
[43:51] he's my pastor I don't care what
[43:53] yourself show it to them in the Bible
[43:58] I'll show you to the opposite direction
[44:01] I'll show you where Brennan said Jezebel
[44:05] didn't understand but they have with her
[44:07] I mean but Elijah was her pastor whether
[44:09] she liked it or not he didn't have any
[44:12] trouble with that because that was what
[44:15] the truth is all right let's get in the
[44:17] hurry now to read thinking about it
[44:19] trying to cover what has what is
[44:22] happening and what's been wrong as I
[44:26] said we accept the Prophet we accept his
[44:29] message we accept that to be and we're
[44:33] not looking for something else you know
[44:35] we're not trying to set aside and
[44:38] brother so-and-so coming along and all
[44:41] and you see the people this message they
[44:42] do that especially you get a young
[44:44] minister he comes along and he's fired
[44:47] up and he's going and really and wanted
[44:49] to do people just flocked to him they
[44:53] run to him because they can't expect if
[44:55] there's any signs and wonders and things
[44:58] name listening to what he's saying
[45:02] they're not hearing what he says because
[45:07] they're caught up in an ecstasy but
[45:13] listen what about it now what about
[45:15] Ephesians 4 that tells you let's read
[45:21] that we'll start from there if I don't
[45:23] finish this off finish it Wednesday
[45:24] that's no problem
[45:28] if I read what all does here we will be
[45:30] Winston Richard was looking at in the
[45:35] councii they've kind of under
[45:37] understaffed in the back a little you
[45:39] know someone had to move around to
[45:41] different positions and here I come in
[45:43] with 30-something quotes when a lot of
[45:47] times I've only got two or three he come
[45:52] in all right let's get this started
[45:54] Ephesians which would be number seven
[45:56] and let's just lay down the scriptures
[45:59] while you're getting there I'll read
[46:02] this one while they're getting that one
[46:03] up run around them on the statue of a
[46:06] perfect man
[46:07] paragraph 406 407 408 I think it hit and
[46:14] once he said build me up O Lord into
[46:21] this let Christ be my head that working
[46:26] through me on my foundation my faith is
[46:31] in him let virtue knowledge temperance
[46:36] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[46:37] working me O Lord is my prayer I don't
[46:41] care it live or die sinker drowned
[46:43] denomination or no denomination friend
[46:45] or no friend let that work in me let
[46:48] Christ virtue his knowledge flow out
[46:51] that I may might be able to teach those
[46:55] and listen to him where God has said in
[46:59] the church apostles prophets teachers
[47:02] pastors evangelists all for the
[47:04] perfecting and bring in all of these
[47:06] virtues into it okay come on for that
[47:14] perfection of the coming of the Son of
[47:16] God each one of these stones are a
[47:19] material of the other one etcetera and
[47:21] these berkshires belong to him and
[47:23] they're pouring out of him down through
[47:26] them but he you listening to what he's
[47:28] saying
[47:28] fivefold ministry for what's to bring
[47:32] wife are the perfect yonder in bringing
[47:35] all these virtues into it for that
[47:38] perfection of the coming of the Son of
[47:40] God now that's the fivefold ministry he
[47:44] names who he places them alright we got
[47:48] plenty of more to go with that but we're
[47:49] going to go with right now go to number
[47:51] seven which is Ephesians 4 but if ever
[47:55] one of us is given grace according to
[47:57] the measure of the gift of Christ
[47:59] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[48:01] on high he led captivity captive and he
[48:04] gave gifts unto men now listen
[48:07] what are those gifts what gifts did he
[48:13] give to man what do you give speaking
[48:17] tongues against yeah foolery
[48:18] that's it huh let's got his place
[48:22] well what does he say the gifts are come
[48:26] on the gift cigar
[48:28] speaking of tongues shouting I steals
[48:29] God gives gifts but what does Paul say
[48:33] about the gifts and he gave gifts unto
[48:37] men now that he ascended what is he but
[48:41] what is yet but that he also descended
[48:43] first into the lower parts of the earth
[48:45] he that descended is the same also that
[48:48] ascended up far above all heavens that
[48:51] he might fill all things and he gave
[48:54] some now here's the gifts right he give
[48:59] gifts what's the gifts he's gonna name
[49:03] them right so don't worry about tongues
[49:08] shout all that skills that's those the
[49:10] the title of the messages is is gifts
[49:14] you know but listen he that descended is
[49:18] the same n he gave some apostles some
[49:21] prophets some evangelists are see gifts
[49:24] and some pastors and teachers he gave
[49:30] gifts which was his faithful ministry
[49:34] was that the same thing the Prophet up
[49:36] here said fill me up Lord that I may
[49:40] teach for the bringing of this oh come
[49:44] on
[49:45] where God has said in church hostile
[49:48] teachers pastors evangelists all for the
[49:50] perfecting and bring in all these
[49:52] virtues into it for that perfection of
[49:55] this coming of the Son of God now your
[49:57] prophets declared what the five four
[49:59] ministries to do I declared back there
[50:01] in statement to you of the things I
[50:04] believe about the fivefold ministry we
[50:06] don't have a message of our own Cyrus
[50:10] were you gonna throw the people don't
[50:11] throw it now we don't have one the
[50:14] Prophet brought the message come on
[50:19] you ain't listening to what I put back
[50:22] before this message Moses was the only
[50:25] man that went to heaven to get to
[50:28] pattern to build a temple by David and
[50:33] Solomon and them that brought it
[50:35] together you know that built the
[50:37] pyramids to represent cry never has in
[50:39] there that they went to heaven and got
[50:41] the pattern Moses got it why cause Moses
[50:45] was a prophet
[50:46] you didn't need nobody else Solomon
[50:48] didn't need something else David didn't
[50:51] need something if he had the profit that
[50:54] profit build a tent sitting over there
[50:55] Solomon built great big monstrosity over
[50:59] here but they said the same thing
[51:01] this has got to be the same as that
[51:04] that's got to be the same as this card
[51:06] he didn't you missed the whole point and
[51:08] Enoch
[51:09] kept it all off by building a pyramid in
[51:11] stone he never talked to Moses but he
[51:14] knowed all about it
[51:16] but none of them went up you understand
[51:18] the message come to Moses that's why the
[51:23] Ten Commandments come to Moses they
[51:26] didn't come to the others the others was
[51:29] to take what Moses said and bring it out
[51:33] to the people they'd have been okay if
[51:36] they'd have stayed with it that way
[51:38] but they didn't nut so are we huh well
[51:43] look at the gifts he give and he gave
[51:45] some apostles and some prophets some
[51:47] evangelists and some pastors and
[51:49] teachers for the perfecting of the
[51:51] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[51:54] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[51:57] we call come into the unity of the faith
[51:59] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[52:02] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[52:05] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[52:06] that we hits floor demote be no more
[52:08] children whether we get the knowledge on
[52:10] this one there would be no more children
[52:12] tossed to and fro and curd about with
[52:14] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[52:16] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[52:18] lie in wait to the sea but speak the
[52:21] truth in love may grow up into him in
[52:24] all things which is the head even Christ
[52:27] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[52:29] together and compacted press to heaven
[52:33] by that which every joint supplies
[52:36] according to the effectual work in the
[52:38] measure of every part making
[52:40] intercession of the body unto the
[52:42] edifying of itself in Christ a fivefold
[52:47] ministry is for the perfecting of
[52:53] science now what is the word perfecting
[52:55] mean there's not the fivefold ministry
[53:01] to get another message to make them
[53:03] perfect it's not at brother Branham just
[53:06] brought it up so far like they say
[53:07] brother Branham swept off the foundation
[53:10] and thank you don't remember some of
[53:12] them doctrines they just swept off the
[53:15] foundation now we're to build the
[53:17] building know no more than David note
[53:21] anything about it other than building it
[53:24] according to Moses all he had to do was
[53:29] build that building according to Moses
[53:32] because Moses was the prophet Moses was
[53:36] allowed to go in and out and everything
[53:38] else review old Bible once they finally
[53:41] unknown at that place and they had to
[53:42] stop but you know there's get the point
[53:46] Moses brought the message the others
[53:49] just built Moses never got out and
[53:52] hammered sawing and in doing this and
[53:54] fixing that and doing that Moses didn't
[53:58] do that
[53:58] Moses sitting back under shade tree he
[54:02] saw you ceiling well doesn't I be I'm
[54:03] stupid too but I got a little sense
[54:05] Moses didn't get out there working
[54:07] he had the rest of working but they
[54:10] worked according to his design right he
[54:15] was the one in charge I don't care if
[54:18] Joshua said this needs to go here Moses
[54:21] says no yeah but this sticks out a
[54:25] little bit and he said don't worry about
[54:28] it it'll fit we just got some other
[54:31] stones to bring in right I'm just
[54:34] illustrating it brother branham brought
[54:36] the message it wasn't just a return
[54:40] message to the faith of the fathers that
[54:44] was a part of it it had to be done
[54:46] were you and I could understand he
[54:52] brought the message of eternal life I've
[54:56] always asked you to do it just go home
[54:59] and take one in little books details all
[55:00] the titles of the sermon and go in 1963
[55:04] and read the titles of the sermons till
[55:07] 1965 try some history unveiling God
[55:14] mighty God unveil who is this male
[55:16] charity future whom every one of them
[55:20] has eternal life little random brought
[55:23] us the message of eternal life that's
[55:28] why I don't have to worry about it all I
[55:30] got to do is build a temple according to
[55:35] Moses you follow me I just need to be a
[55:39] good David in the Solomon to build it
[55:42] according to Moses because I got him in
[55:47] front of me and what brother branham say
[55:50] he said you say when I say he said cause
[55:54] I'll be responsible he all right
[55:59] and I never heard but two parts of the
[56:03] early part of the ministry where brother
[56:05] Branham was teaching the white horse
[56:07] rider as the Holy Ghost you know that
[56:09] God would not condemn me for teaching it
[56:12] until that they come when truth I faced
[56:15] it then I would have to change over do
[56:19] you understand what I'm talking about
[56:20] you understand what was on that man's
[56:22] back you really realize of all of our
[56:25] lives and everything it was depended
[56:27] upon whether or not he could be who God
[56:30] said he was no he's not God no but he
[56:42] was the messenger from God
[56:45] he was the one to tell us about God and
[56:48] once he reached the place
[56:51] I think reached all I believe on
[56:53] adoptions and things yes once he reached
[56:56] the place to go out there and meet that
[56:58] angels of the Lord I believe that was
[57:00] his adoption you can believe what you
[57:02] want to that's no problem with me I
[57:04] believe that was when he was adopted
[57:05] when the cloud came down and full into
[57:08] full ministry you know what was being
[57:10] said
[57:11] you ever heard brother Branham say that
[57:14] God says he said he steps back when he
[57:18] adopts his son he steps back and says if
[57:21] you hear any more you're gonna hear from
[57:24] him
[57:26] there's to hear you him if you hear any
[57:29] more you're gonna hear from him because
[57:31] he's now in charge I understand but what
[57:39] is it
[57:40] what was the gifts given done under man
[57:42] the fifo ministry don't make them
[57:48] nothing they don't make nothing for me
[57:53] to be a part of the fivefold ministry
[57:54] you can't serve over that's God I'm a
[57:56] preacher you know we're gonna get to
[58:00] that in a little bit don't we won't
[58:02] we'll get to it Wednesday night or next
[58:04] Sunday get some college there without
[58:09] repentance right you don't repent to get
[58:18] a gift but there's non spiritual gifts
[58:21] it can go from one person to another one
[58:24] and only be used one time in your life
[58:27] that's non spiritual gift with the
[58:30] fivefold ministry in the end the gifts
[58:34] of where you you can it can go from one
[58:36] to the other speaking in tongues or
[58:38] discernments or anything remember that
[58:42] we'll have to answer with the fivefold
[58:47] ministry answers only to the Prophet
[58:54] come on I could stay with you all day
[58:56] long because God has revealed all these
[58:58] things for 40 years
[58:59] how could Paul condemn Philip this and
[59:03] Jaime Gnaeus or teaching the
[59:07] resurrection was passed when he was
[59:11] where they got it from because he was
[59:14] teaching the resurrection was passed
[59:16] come on
[59:17] they took it wrong and made it the
[59:20] physical he was talking about the
[59:21] spiritual but because they were against
[59:24] him he could turn them over to Satan for
[59:27] the destruction I couldn't do it you
[59:30] couldn't do it look Paul could
[59:32] he said it's why you don't feel food
[59:35] with gifts
[59:36] you either got a gift or you don't got a
[59:39] gift and there's no such thing as to
[59:41] seek the most earnest gift let's just
[59:43] say well I'm pastor and I need to seek
[59:45] being a an evangelist I need to seek
[59:48] being a they don't have them to do with
[59:51] that that has to do with your non
[59:54] spiritual gifts your non spiritual gifts
[59:57] you are to seek the most earnest our
[59:59] best gift for the operation of Christ
[1:00:04] but not so in the film industry by film
[1:00:08] industry is predestinated gifts are
[1:00:13] predestinated I'm reading brother
[1:00:15] branham willory know the nine spiritual
[1:00:18] gifts is predestinated before knowledge
[1:00:22] the fivefold ministry has predestinated
[1:00:24] straight from God to the people falling
[1:00:29] right behind the Prophet if you don't
[1:00:33] believe that's true I'll ask you what
[1:00:35] happened when Moses passed on I ain't
[1:00:39] saying they're supposed to bend somebody
[1:00:41] stepped up now don't get your garbage
[1:00:43] can running somebody ain't to step up
[1:00:45] I'm just illustrating when Moses stepped
[1:00:49] off the scene there was Joshua
[1:00:53] but remember Joshua was a prophet this
[1:00:56] prophet left that prophet was just to
[1:00:58] bring more talent it's no such thing now
[1:01:00] no such thing as you thinking well now
[1:01:03] what it should have been brother Branham
[1:01:05] brought the message but when he stepped
[1:01:07] off the scene
[1:01:08] other day a wish to take over no no no
[1:01:13] the fivefold ministry who are we
[1:01:18] supposed to follow the fivefold ministry
[1:01:23] dr. Brennan will make statements that
[1:01:25] sounds so outstanding said will a bride
[1:01:29] have a ministry he said sure she
[1:01:35] consists of apostles prophets
[1:01:39] evangelists pastors and teachers he said
[1:01:42] that's what the fivefold ministry you
[1:01:46] see that's why you can't go no higher
[1:01:47] than your pastor because if he's a true
[1:01:51] pastor he's going to take you to Christ
[1:01:54] the word and you're not going any higher
[1:01:58] who would want to okay let's start
[1:02:07] reading okay go ahead we'll start with
[1:02:11] number 8 and we'll read and go as far as
[1:02:13] we can and then we'll take up Wednesday
[1:02:17] or in the Bible and they'll get this one
[1:02:20] it said there was set out apostles
[1:02:25] prophets evangelists teachers pastors
[1:02:28] all these for the perfecting of the
[1:02:31] church God set them in the church God
[1:02:37] set the gifts so I gave the gifts not to
[1:02:42] nine spiritual gifts separate that when
[1:02:47] you were reading gifts and it stays with
[1:02:48] the Ministry get the ministry that's the
[1:02:52] gifts because those gifts are higher
[1:02:57] than this natural gifts come on all
[1:03:07] these for the perfecting of the church
[1:03:09] God set them in the church now there's
[1:03:12] nine spiritual gifts that we can lay
[1:03:14] hands on and so forth and pray earnestly
[1:03:16] for the best gifts okay
[1:03:22] but you don't lay hands on the FIFO
[1:03:24] ministry to give them a gift of ministry
[1:03:29] you only lay hands on them as a
[1:03:31] congregational group as two people to
[1:03:34] show that you honor that and they're
[1:03:36] respected among you and as part of the
[1:03:38] ministry you don't lay it on there for
[1:03:41] gifts now we know the truth you can't
[1:03:44] lay hands on the non spiritual gifts to
[1:03:47] get a gift the gifts and callings are
[1:03:49] without repentance you either got it or
[1:03:50] don't got it
[1:03:51] you're born with it what about the
[1:03:56] fivefold ministry that's why you don't
[1:04:01] vote a preacher in and vote him out it's
[1:04:08] done every day in this message and they
[1:04:10] ain't no scripture far
[1:04:11] show me the scripture where you can vote
[1:04:13] a pastor in vote him out he's the way I
[1:04:18] just spin it well show it tell me that's
[1:04:23] going to me you don't vote on the
[1:04:27] fivefold ministry God ordained that
[1:04:31] we'll read a lot of it
[1:04:33] listen now there's nine spiritual gifts
[1:04:36] that we can lay on the hands and so
[1:04:37] forth and pray earnestly for the best
[1:04:38] gifts and so forth like that but these
[1:04:41] others are predestinated gifts of God
[1:04:43] God set them in the church the fifl
[1:04:47] ministry right through the age that's
[1:04:49] coming and John the Baptist was a
[1:04:51] special forerunner for the age God just
[1:04:54] for ordained him to do that work do you
[1:04:57] believe that now what's he talking about
[1:04:58] John no you know before because listen
[1:05:03] do you see he's a prophet he's more than
[1:05:06] a prophet prophets are not voted into
[1:05:12] office right our prophets not fivefold
[1:05:21] ministry prophet he's not even voted but
[1:05:23] what about a prophet like brother
[1:05:24] Branham he was ordained a prophet from
[1:05:28] the foundation of the world but at the
[1:05:30] same time he was ordained a prophet the
[1:05:32] fivefold ministry was ordained right
[1:05:33] with him
[1:05:35] now you tell me I'm wrong the gifts and
[1:05:44] callings of God are without repentance
[1:05:45] come on let's read go to the next one
[1:05:50] watchman's one of the night paragraph 81
[1:05:54] we should this be rolled over and over
[1:05:57] and I'll tell you what I'd done in this
[1:05:59] and you know my cut and paste everybody
[1:06:01] know I just couldn't put it and go and
[1:06:03] tape it and I just I never tried to make
[1:06:06] a line up this one message I never tried
[1:06:09] to make a line up I just took them as
[1:06:12] they came put them down
[1:06:13] took them as they came whatever they
[1:06:15] fall in line so you're gonna hear me
[1:06:17] read something here
[1:06:18] this says identically in the next quote
[1:06:20] are you gonna hear it cause I just
[1:06:23] picked him up I didn't want to do to try
[1:06:25] to say some line that you would say well
[1:06:28] that he line these up to kind of make
[1:06:31] that look like I don't have to do that
[1:06:37] if it's God if God if not then we don't
[1:06:40] worry about it this is all the message
[1:06:41] watch them on what of the night but you
[1:06:44] know him and you know me so just make me
[1:06:47] Lord by divine gift that was ordained
[1:06:50] before the world begun and this ministry
[1:06:53] should be in this day just like a
[1:06:55] ministries or ordained for that God
[1:07:00] places in the church apostles prophets
[1:07:03] teachers pastors evangelists so forth
[1:07:07] God does that
[1:07:08] that's his ordained gifts he doesn't
[1:07:13] that's his ordained gifts
[1:07:16] let's read as many as we can okay
[1:07:21] greater than Solomon number eight be
[1:07:24] that was a day he will innate be alright
[1:07:27] and you'll see by ABCD that up with
[1:07:30] these and later on as it come along I
[1:07:32] just took them in all right this is from
[1:07:37] the message greater than Solomon is here
[1:07:38] prophets how the Word of God and are
[1:07:41] born to profit a gift of prophecy is
[1:07:43] different that's a gift
[1:07:47] I'll give the prophesies a gift are you
[1:07:50] getting the Knights personal gifts as
[1:07:54] gifts but the fivefold ministry is
[1:07:58] ordained to be that it's not just a gift
[1:08:02] that can go from one person to another
[1:08:04] one it's not something that you seek the
[1:08:06] best gift well I'm I'm a pastor but I
[1:08:10] ain't getting paid too good so I'm on
[1:08:11] becoming evangelists prophets how the
[1:08:17] Word of God and are born to profit I'll
[1:08:19] gift of prophecy is different that's a
[1:08:22] gift
[1:08:22] now there's nine there's five ordained
[1:08:25] gifts in the church apostles prophet
[1:08:27] teachers pastors evangelists now that's
[1:08:29] the five gifts that God places in the
[1:08:32] church by his foreknowledge
[1:08:34] then there's nine gifts that's locally
[1:08:38] in the church right speaking in tongues
[1:08:42] interpreting of tongue and give the
[1:08:44] wisdom and knowledge and prophesy and so
[1:08:47] forth them nine spiritual gifts that
[1:08:49] operate through the church but then
[1:08:51] there's not there five office gifts
[1:08:54] what's that wording he's using five
[1:08:57] office gifts that God puts in the church
[1:09:03] and how we love to see them all
[1:09:05] operating one of them is the pastor
[1:09:08] teacher and those things in the others
[1:09:11] comes along in confirmation gifts are to
[1:09:14] magnify and God just got it so even a
[1:09:18] fool will be will not be excused with
[1:09:23] all right listen so what are you getting
[1:09:25] that going to the next influence this is
[1:09:30] 1963 well the days we say the days of
[1:09:34] miracles is past we say while they're
[1:09:39] getting that pulled up we say well we
[1:09:43] don't see nothing going on now I just
[1:09:46] put this in the end so I want you read
[1:09:47] it see we say well the days the miracle
[1:09:51] is fast I can show you where God
[1:09:54] ordained miracles
[1:09:58] right now you can't tell me where he
[1:10:02] ever took it away
[1:10:05] we don't relate that to the right way
[1:10:07] see he ordained gifts he never did see
[1:10:12] where he took it away
[1:10:15] he gave the gifts he never took him away
[1:10:17] it's the Scriptures go into all the
[1:10:19] world preach the gospel to every
[1:10:21] creature what because its gifts cannot
[1:10:25] be taken away but now the nine spiritual
[1:10:32] gifts they can go up and down brother
[1:10:37] Branham I'll read you in a little while
[1:10:38] across one where he says they can even
[1:10:40] be passed from one person to another
[1:10:45] right but the fivefold ministry don't
[1:10:49] change that's why the preachers of this
[1:10:52] message you don't even know their
[1:10:53] scriptures what's the call to preach
[1:10:56] I've asked ministers this question
[1:10:59] what's the call to preach well you know
[1:11:04] I just I got to this and I got to that
[1:11:06] and I got insisting hard trouble the
[1:11:08] last one guard one day could I be a
[1:11:10] preacher and he said you know he didn't
[1:11:12] say not so I just accepted it Paul tells
[1:11:15] you what the call to preach is I stand
[1:11:20] here for 40 years I know what God what
[1:11:22] my call was I've said it over 40 years
[1:11:26] what it is I had to worry about it Paul
[1:11:30] said that his calling was the mystery
[1:11:32] that he had to preach come on read your
[1:11:36] Bible he said the mission wherever I'm
[1:11:39] called Paul's call was the mystery of
[1:11:43] the ingression of the Gentiles the
[1:11:45] adoptions the things that he brought you
[1:11:50] know what my call is to tell you what
[1:11:52] that prophet said
[1:11:59] I don't have a message then I have parts
[1:12:02] that he's dealt with me about and I've
[1:12:05] talked these ministers that you will
[1:12:09] have certain scriptures that will stand
[1:12:11] out in your life as you go along mark
[1:12:14] those scriptures even the natural people
[1:12:18] than that you know delay it t mark the
[1:12:21] scriptures that are brought to you women
[1:12:24] men whatever those scriptures has to do
[1:12:26] with your inner being because I believe
[1:12:31] in God speaking to the lung congregation
[1:12:34] as well as speaking to the fivefold
[1:12:36] ministry as well as he spoke to the
[1:12:38] Prophet I'll show you where he put it in
[1:12:43] you show me where it come out
[1:12:46] listen preach the gospel what's the next
[1:12:55] from the message there's God there's God
[1:13:01] change his mind
[1:13:02] 65 I do not believe that you lay hands
[1:13:07] on the people and give them guilt and
[1:13:11] even then the nine spiritual gifts who
[1:13:13] don't work you either got it or don't
[1:13:16] got it Paul wouldn't say and he said I'm
[1:13:19] putting laying hands on to stir up the
[1:13:22] gift the fact of coming from your what
[1:13:25] was it her his grew grandmother or
[1:13:28] something loss or units or something he
[1:13:31] brought it down because that was where
[1:13:33] the gift dropped down to come to that
[1:13:36] person he said I'm just laying on hands
[1:13:38] to activate and that the words get you
[1:13:40] to you they are listening I do not
[1:13:44] believe that you lay hands on people and
[1:13:46] give them gifts if some callings are
[1:13:47] without repentance they are
[1:13:49] predestinated of God to meet the age and
[1:13:51] the time of that age any Bible student
[1:13:54] knows that's the truth Moses was born
[1:13:56] just in time Jeremiah in time all the
[1:13:59] rest of them John the Baptist's in time
[1:14:01] Jesus in time and we're in time right
[1:14:04] we're in time going to the next time
[1:14:09] tested
[1:14:12] she tested faith produces goods you
[1:14:17] don't lay hands on one another for them
[1:14:20] God gifts God has said in the church
[1:14:23] Jesus was the son of God in the garden
[1:14:25] predicted to see to the woman and crying
[1:14:27] in the wilderness from John Dawei gifts
[1:14:29] and callings are not somebody's done
[1:14:36] it's what God that's done it's not what
[1:14:42] somebody has done somebody's done it's
[1:14:45] what God has done they're born they're
[1:14:47] raised up with them it's what God has
[1:14:50] done now he called some of us to preach
[1:14:52] some of us to teach some of us with
[1:14:55] different spirits of operation now
[1:14:58] there's well our non spiritual gifts in
[1:15:00] the local body see now there's a gifts
[1:15:03] of prophecy that could be on any person
[1:15:05] in here tonight and maybe never own them
[1:15:08] again that just comes and goes there's
[1:15:11] quite a difference between the spirit of
[1:15:13] prophecy and a prophet listen a spirit
[1:15:18] of prophecy is to be judged by two or
[1:15:21] three that has discernment therefore it
[1:15:23] can can ever be given to the church
[1:15:27] before it can ever be given all right
[1:15:29] listen when the Old Testament prophets
[1:15:32] stood Isaiah Jeremiah they had thus
[1:15:34] saith the Lord they didn't answer to
[1:15:36] nobody a prophet don't answer there's
[1:15:40] nobody right a prophet answers to God
[1:15:45] I'm talking about brother branham's
[1:15:47] ministry him and the Prophet I'm talking
[1:15:49] about an ordained prophet for the aged
[1:15:51] and what needs to be brother Branham
[1:15:52] never had to answer it or nobody he
[1:15:57] didn't have to be judged but if you got
[1:16:03] this guilt you can be you don't have to
[1:16:05] be judged and that show me where the
[1:16:07] thigh bone industry hasn't you said what
[1:16:14] do you think and just preach anything
[1:16:15] you want to yelling the fivefold
[1:16:17] ministry and do that anyway that's
[1:16:19] sensible you do that anyway but if your
[1:16:24] fivefold ministry
[1:16:25] you're gonna be judged by the Prophet oh
[1:16:29] okay now we've hit something that breaks
[1:16:32] a lot of things right you realize that
[1:16:35] the way that I bring this message you
[1:16:38] realize brothers that are ministers in
[1:16:40] this church the way you bring this
[1:16:42] message you're going to answer to the
[1:16:45] messenger of this age the way I handle
[1:16:52] this message and what I do I'll have to
[1:16:54] stand before the Prophet you see how
[1:17:01] serious it is
[1:17:02] you don't swap places with it no you
[1:17:06] don't want the place you want to run the
[1:17:08] place it's like I've always said about
[1:17:11] you know you go into a building you've
[1:17:13] got a president if I spread it in vice
[1:17:17] president don't ever want to be
[1:17:18] President why cousin got too many
[1:17:20] decisions to make so he wants to be vice
[1:17:22] president we can tell the president what
[1:17:24] to do
[1:17:28] powerful Minister okay
[1:17:30] all right he calls us to preach so much
[1:17:35] to teach different spirits go to the
[1:17:37] next one ATF and then gifts where Paul
[1:17:41] said now listen to it now remember what
[1:17:45] I said want to go up there on one of the
[1:17:47] quotes where he said offices remember
[1:17:52] that in the court of two before I said
[1:17:54] remember that offices look at this one
[1:17:56] man b14
[1:17:59] I pray earnestly for the best gift
[1:18:02] that's church gifts that's not offices
[1:18:07] the fivefold ministry is an office the
[1:18:16] fivefold ministry is an office that God
[1:18:19] has ordained okay listen there's get
[1:18:24] there's a gift and did an office it's an
[1:18:31] office that's a profit there's a lot of
[1:18:34] difference between a profit and the gift
[1:18:36] of prophecy before a gift of prophecy
[1:18:38] really should be given in the church it
[1:18:40] has to come before to our three judges
[1:18:42] that's got the gift of discernment to
[1:18:45] say whether it can be said but never did
[1:18:49] you see anybody stand before Isaiah to
[1:18:52] judge you understand what he's saying
[1:18:55] not stand before Isaiah to judge he's
[1:18:58] saying who can stand before I didn't
[1:18:59] tell him a different way you understand
[1:19:01] are you reading that sensible reading
[1:19:04] you're reading it word for word now I'm
[1:19:06] reading what he's saying it can given in
[1:19:11] the church he has to come before two or
[1:19:13] three judges that's got the gift of
[1:19:15] discernment to say whether it can be
[1:19:16] given but never did you see anybody
[1:19:19] stand before I say up to judge the he
[1:19:22] was born to prophet them prophets they
[1:19:25] were they had dust at the Lord right up
[1:19:27] through right up through life see it's a
[1:19:31] lot of difference between gifts that's
[1:19:37] my title it's spiritual gifts because
[1:19:39] they are spiritual gifts you lay it to
[1:19:43] you have your gifts give some college or
[1:19:45] without repentance you have your gift
[1:19:47] you have the things that are to be there
[1:19:50] to discern what the speaking in tongues
[1:19:52] all of the different things
[1:19:54] the Atlantis got their gifts I encourage
[1:19:57] you to use those gifts because I have to
[1:20:00] quote what the Prophet said he's in any
[1:20:02] church without the gift it's gonna have
[1:20:04] to give an answer now that's the direct
[1:20:06] quote some like to give an answer what
[1:20:11] kind of an answer would I give now this
[1:20:14] has happened what kind of an answer what
[1:20:15] I give brother call he stands up and he
[1:20:18] speaks in tongues and I grab him sit
[1:20:19] down said now you interpret it or shut
[1:20:22] up a minister done that now if God had
[1:20:29] moved on the sing you know who I think
[1:20:31] would went out the door not brother
[1:20:34] Colley because he was honest but you see
[1:20:39] people say well now tell you what man we
[1:20:41] keepin it straight around here you don't
[1:20:45] want the gifts to expose you
[1:20:48] Oh see that's why I believe in games
[1:20:54] I believe God can speak through brother
[1:20:57] Kali and interpret it through brother IO
[1:21:00] and tell you whether I'm right or wrong
[1:21:02] oh yeah but you're not for all you know
[1:21:09] you gonna stand for nobody code if I'm a
[1:21:11] true gift I'll take correction but if
[1:21:13] I'm not now that I go okay come on
[1:21:19] infallibility infallible proof of the
[1:21:21] resurrection priests in 57 I different
[1:21:30] with some of you theology ology of
[1:21:33] laying your hands on one and setting
[1:21:36] this one apart and that one apart and
[1:21:38] giving them this one gifts God gives
[1:21:41] gifts give some callings or without
[1:21:43] repentance that's not altogether the
[1:21:45] heaviest teaching that's Bible teaching
[1:21:47] listen there see the word impossible
[1:21:49] they are gifts many they are gifts
[1:21:53] ministering spirits since from the
[1:21:56] presence of God the minister and every
[1:21:58] office of God do you believe a fivefold
[1:22:02] ministry is an angel you've read brother
[1:22:07] Branham was an angel come on that's why
[1:22:14] he stands for nobody you go straight to
[1:22:17] the presence of God the fivefold
[1:22:19] ministry don't stand before people they
[1:22:21] go straight to the message your brain is
[1:22:27] dying a little bit tighter than I
[1:22:29] thought you know I'm showing you this is
[1:22:33] a dangerous place it's a dangerous place
[1:22:38] to walk into ministry and proclaim to
[1:22:42] serve yourself is to be a minister it's
[1:22:46] deadly you don't have to give an account
[1:22:49] for me but around says you don't said
[1:22:53] your wife don't have any given account
[1:22:54] for you I said you gotta give an account
[1:22:57] for her so is it with the turmeric
[1:23:01] now look in every office then in the
[1:23:06] local group there's nine spiritual gifts
[1:23:09] that come into the audience that don't
[1:23:12] belong to any it's just belong here it's
[1:23:15] just in the local church you see when
[1:23:17] they do this and one this one may do
[1:23:19] this and this one may never do it again
[1:23:22] this is one over here and that's just
[1:23:25] local gifts trying to get you to see one
[1:23:29] time the non spiritual gifts they can
[1:23:34] move from one person to another one and
[1:23:36] you seek the most earnest gift but when
[1:23:40] you move up in the fivefold ministry I
[1:23:44] am trying to trade the places with
[1:23:46] nobody not just what I am and I have to
[1:23:51] remain that because I'm in that part all
[1:23:55] right listen
[1:23:58] let me get a couple more and we'll quit
[1:24:00] too Wednesday I just hope you remember
[1:24:03] what I've tried to bring out number nine
[1:24:08] from the word message perseverance 62 I
[1:24:14] believe that there's a church coming
[1:24:16] into that perfection that Ministry of
[1:24:20] perfection were the offices now what's
[1:24:28] the offices where the offices were
[1:24:30] apostles prophets teachers fighted
[1:24:32] evangelist for the perfecting of the
[1:24:34] church then pastors and teachers and so
[1:24:36] forth will be so with the word until the
[1:24:39] whole thing will work right up to the
[1:24:41] coming of the Lord I believe that I
[1:24:43] believe that we're nearing that time now
[1:24:49] powerful ministry for the perfecting of
[1:24:54] the church let's go another way Jesus
[1:24:57] Christ number 10 Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:00] yesterday today and forever 62 now what
[1:25:03] happens here a gift now the Bible said
[1:25:07] for these minister brothers the Bible
[1:25:09] said that God has said in the church
[1:25:11] five different gifts is that right
[1:25:15] has now there's nine gifts in the local
[1:25:18] church just on one or the other but five
[1:25:22] ministerial gifts apostles prophets
[1:25:25] teachers pastors evangelists is that
[1:25:27] right five spiritual gifts now those
[1:25:30] gifts are for the perfecting of the
[1:25:32] church that keeps the church in order
[1:25:36] pastors teachers evangelists to keep the
[1:25:40] church in halter right perfecting then
[1:25:49] Jesus came
[1:25:50] but God has said in the church five
[1:25:53] different gifts apostles prophets
[1:25:55] teachers but those are part of
[1:25:56] perfecting of the church that is his
[1:25:59] proof his ministering spirit to the
[1:26:04] church to bring the body of Christ
[1:26:06] together by foam industry here you him
[1:26:15] recent fifty-eight sufficient for God's
[1:26:19] need he has said in the church gifts
[1:26:22] first apostles are missionaries both the
[1:26:25] son apostles mean the one sent mission
[1:26:27] Irving's one sent apostles prophets
[1:26:29] teachers evangelists they're all
[1:26:31] predestinated gifts of God gifts and
[1:26:34] callings are without repentance they're
[1:26:36] placed in the church to bring the church
[1:26:38] together hold it together for the glory
[1:26:41] of God by film industry will stop on
[1:26:50] that one because I got plenty more
[1:26:55] mm-hmm what is your whole point of what
[1:26:58] you're trying to say brother Dale God
[1:27:02] has brought us a prophet we've got the
[1:27:06] message thank God for the technologies
[1:27:09] and the things where we can look it up
[1:27:10] and see what is saying you know what
[1:27:13] have we've back in Luther Wesley or
[1:27:15] something like that
[1:27:16] when they wouldn't even hardly get a
[1:27:17] book about what to teach here regardless
[1:27:19] we can go to the message to see what
[1:27:22] this prophet teaches we can go to
[1:27:28] my agency I can go to the message to
[1:27:33] find the things that he's saying to me
[1:27:36] you can go to the sign message to see
[1:27:39] whether or not I'm saying what he said
[1:27:43] what a wonderful day you say that puts
[1:27:46] you on the spot I've been on the spot
[1:27:50] all my life
[1:27:51] I think the joke is truth when I come
[1:27:55] into this message I realize one thing
[1:27:57] for sure the Prophet was the Prophet not
[1:28:02] me the prophets message was the message
[1:28:09] not what I'd say first sermon I preached
[1:28:13] in this message in 1969 in Athens
[1:28:17] Georgia the old hollyhocks the brother
[1:28:19] had went off someone wanted me to preach
[1:28:21] and I spoke Park and I preached that the
[1:28:27] bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[1:28:31] of man on the earth that she'd be the
[1:28:36] final voice to the final age I'll show
[1:28:40] you the notes are in my Bible that she
[1:28:45] would be the Bride of Christ would be
[1:28:47] the fullness of the Godhead bodily this
[1:28:48] is 69 this is when we didn't have the
[1:28:52] doing we got ever concordance we could
[1:28:54] get but 90% of the concordance has had
[1:28:57] about 15 pages of false doctrine now you
[1:29:00] that was back there know I'm telling the
[1:29:01] truth they had their own ideas brother
[1:29:04] so-and-so put out a concordant his first
[1:29:06] 15 pages were proving his point I just
[1:29:09] matter to me I took them to get the
[1:29:13] truth then I made my own way don't 70s
[1:29:18] reels and you some of you sisters can
[1:29:22] type Feist enough to be able to type off
[1:29:25] what brother Branham says you know and
[1:29:27] do it uh-huh I had to run about five
[1:29:30] words and stop it and write it down and
[1:29:32] I'd back it up and I'd put down about
[1:29:35] ten words not back up and come find out
[1:29:37] I couldn't even keep ten words Trey you
[1:29:40] ever try
[1:29:41] when I backed up went over it backed up
[1:29:43] when I was like out what he said because
[1:29:49] I believed it and I wasn't looking for
[1:29:53] something to glorify me or to make me
[1:29:54] something I was looking for something
[1:29:58] because it was going to be anything and
[1:30:01] I was in no way thinking about a
[1:30:02] ministry up until about that time but if
[1:30:07] there was going to be anything that my
[1:30:12] ministry would have to line up with the
[1:30:15] Prophet you said we're brother Dale what
[1:30:20] tell us what you think your ministry is
[1:30:22] what I said while ago my ministry is to
[1:30:25] teach you or talk to you about the
[1:30:27] things the Prophet has taught not what I
[1:30:31] think about it not what you think about
[1:30:33] it but what he had to say about it
[1:30:36] that's my ministry and then it's hard
[1:30:38] thing that it's always been when nobody
[1:30:41] would touch Daniel 70 weeks right
[1:30:46] they won't even do it today back in the
[1:30:52] 70s I was speaking on those things to
[1:30:58] try to bring light of truth comes
[1:31:01] brother Branham said it he's if you
[1:31:03] don't understand daniel said new ish you
[1:31:05] can't understand the seals that's direct
[1:31:09] quote right in front of you Daniel 70
[1:31:10] weeks book but even till this day they
[1:31:14] don't want it they don't want truth that
[1:31:18] ain't nothing to me I'm just saying that
[1:31:21] seemed like that my ministry when people
[1:31:23] were talking about the new birth or talk
[1:31:26] about adoption or a statue a perfect man
[1:31:28] it just always seemed to be that I would
[1:31:33] try to bring forth what I could see what
[1:31:34] that prophet is saying I've done what I
[1:31:38] desired to do I desire to bring to you a
[1:31:43] message from brother branham's message
[1:31:47] not my own but to distant libraries that
[1:31:51] word illustrate bring out or what
[1:31:54] on what he said to bring it out in the
[1:31:58] open how many of you heard me say this
[1:32:01] you can put my name on your on the tab
[1:32:05] your name on my tapes and send them to
[1:32:07] the world because I don't want no glory
[1:32:10] I've been offered a lot of things in
[1:32:13] this message I don't want it I want
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ to live in you there's my
[1:32:24] greatest goal and honor mr. not argue
[1:32:28] about doctrines and ideas but to believe
[1:32:34] what the Prophet is said cuz I believe
[1:32:39] that ever doctrine he brought is in the
[1:32:42] Word of God but I believe it's in there
[1:32:48] and it's so hidden from mankind until
[1:32:50] there's no way for mankind to get it so
[1:32:58] they have to follow the fivefold
[1:33:00] ministry so are you willing to follow it
[1:33:05] are you willing to put everything you
[1:33:07] got on the fire for ministry you know I
[1:33:11] see some of you saying well ain't
[1:33:14] nothing else to do so much more stick
[1:33:15] around well it's alright I've told you
[1:33:22] the way I am I wouldn't listen to a lot
[1:33:25] of preachers in this message that are
[1:33:27] big names at boy you know man they're
[1:33:30] the ones both tell us what to do know
[1:33:36] the prophets already told us what to do
[1:33:40] he brought the message I'm just as you
[1:33:43] want to call it and I don't believe in
[1:33:45] being a parakeet you know what I mean by
[1:33:47] parakeet is to quote as a quote to the
[1:33:49] quote I believe in saying the Prophet
[1:33:51] said so and so and now here's why he
[1:33:54] said it you said well that makes you
[1:33:58] interpret it come show me anytime I
[1:34:04] preach anything the door is open for you
[1:34:07] to come and say brother Dale I don't
[1:34:10] agree with this we have no problems the
[1:34:15] problem is is when you go tell everybody
[1:34:17] else that you don't agree you could at
[1:34:23] least come and tell me and discuss it it
[1:34:26] said well bro they'll all agree we right
[1:34:28] here right here yeah it's okay
[1:34:31] you understand certainly what I'm
[1:34:33] talking about so I believe a fivefold
[1:34:37] ministry is to take this message let me
[1:34:41] give you that last quote you see if I
[1:34:45] can find it they can if I can get to it
[1:34:50] it's 33 32 33
[1:35:03] off the message things that are to be
[1:35:06] it's number 32 brothers if you don't
[1:35:09] notify stuff but I'm very thankful for
[1:35:15] these open doors that I've had to go
[1:35:17] into an inspiration is give to young men
[1:35:23] like your pastor here let's call them as
[1:35:27] I'm beginning to get old and know that
[1:35:30] my days are numbered and know now that
[1:35:33] these young men can take this message
[1:35:37] and sweep it on to the coming of the
[1:35:40] Lord but you know what most people is
[1:35:45] done the Prophet finished the message
[1:35:48] they said I am waiting on him to come
[1:35:50] back and tell them something else I'm
[1:35:52] not against that I'm against you sitting
[1:35:55] down I'm not trying to interpret I'm
[1:36:02] trying to tell you I'm against you
[1:36:03] sitting down just stop him cuz you're
[1:36:06] gonna die well who are you I love this
[1:36:15] statement right here run up 31 just back
[1:36:19] go every which way up or down and look
[1:36:24] what he said this is off the message
[1:36:27] believe in God 1952 now that's my
[1:36:33] Commission that's what God gave me what
[1:36:38] he gave ever gospel preacher who will
[1:36:42] believe him wait to give ever gospel
[1:36:45] preacher that believe him what is the
[1:36:52] one thing he's give ever gospel preacher
[1:36:54] they believe look that's what God gave
[1:37:00] me is what he gave ever gospel preacher
[1:37:03] who will believe him what to give the
[1:37:08] power and authority to break that spirit
[1:37:11] I believe with all of my
[1:37:16] argh that ever diamond power that's in
[1:37:19] here at this minute is already broken I
[1:37:22] do I believe that every sick person in
[1:37:25] here right now feels a lot different
[1:37:28] raise up raise your hands you who to sit
[1:37:32] you know but what's the power given to
[1:37:35] any preacher the power and authority to
[1:37:42] break the spirit there's another quote
[1:37:45] I'll find it to break Satan's spell he
[1:37:51] has over your eyes that God can speak
[1:37:55] straight to you that's all I'm trying to
[1:37:59] do trying to get that spell broke off of
[1:38:02] your eyes that God can speak not to me
[1:38:08] did he can speak to you that should be
[1:38:14] the glory and honor and a thoughts of
[1:38:16] any Minister is to try to break Satan's
[1:38:21] spell he's got over your eyes that God
[1:38:25] can speak to you
[1:38:26] let's take ministers come away musicians
[1:38:30] come on we'll read some more quotes
[1:38:33] sometimes you that how these noses bring
[1:38:34] them back will you entity because the
[1:38:37] Prophet said a lot of things about the
[1:38:39] fivefold ministry let's see if we
[1:38:45] believe it well okay if we don't believe
[1:38:49] it then we'll take it out of the message
[1:38:55] that distracted you did it if you don't
[1:38:59] believe it won't stake it out that's
[1:39:03] what a man told me about the guilts one
[1:39:05] time what is it during the first
[1:39:09] Corinthians 13 there's something about
[1:39:10] to give some time he said dad don't let
[1:39:12] me tuck out of the Bible
[1:39:16] that's okay
[1:39:17] give me your Bible right give me your
[1:39:23] Bible you see what I said I'll take it
[1:39:26] out
[1:39:28] you know what I'd have done if you'd
[1:39:30] give it to me I'd have tore that out not
[1:39:35] hand it back to us and that's not in
[1:39:37] your Bible anymore he knew better than
[1:39:39] in with that Bible he knew if I'd got a
[1:39:42] hold of it I take it out why cause if it
[1:39:44] ain't work nothing take it out the
[1:39:49] entire Bible is God's Word God has given
[1:39:54] us the answer to everything we have need
[1:39:56] of it's in his Bible
[1:39:58] he sent the prophets he sent the people
[1:40:00] to bring that word that would be his
[1:40:02] word speaking straight down those
[1:40:04] prophets were not God
[1:40:08] but they were the closest thing that
[1:40:10] could ever be to God on this earth and
[1:40:14] you know what they still stand
[1:40:16] Moses today stands between you and God
[1:40:19] we just think about those Israelites and
[1:40:22] all they're doing all I can
[1:40:23] know Moses is standing before between
[1:40:26] God you know us every prophet is
[1:40:30] standing there to try to get us to line
[1:40:34] up to the word see that way then we got
[1:40:42] a message we don't have to depend on
[1:40:44] nothing else we got a message we're not
[1:40:47] looking for another messenger we're
[1:40:50] looking for this message to be made
[1:40:52] alive the Prophet said after the door
[1:40:58] the Gentile church is closed God willing
[1:40:59] on the church and he said here doing one
[1:41:01] year what theologist tried to do in 2000
[1:41:03] he said but he's doing it now that's why
[1:41:08] I'm in a great revival folks I've been
[1:41:11] in a revival ever since I've been in
[1:41:12] Mexico time in the revival of the
[1:41:14] opening of God's Word
[1:41:16] that is my glory and honor the grace I
[1:41:19] could think of it's for God to speak to
[1:41:21] you and me about his word what else
[1:41:25] would we want what would be greater the
[1:41:32] whole world and blue sea so what would
[1:41:36] be greater what do we got go ahead

[1:44:19] so now let's believe that you'll keep
[1:44:21] that same attitude no matter what they
[1:44:24] say what transpired that you try to do
[1:44:28] what you try to do right didn't that
[1:44:31] work whatever happens there's no
[1:44:34] responsibility it's believing it's all
[1:44:36] okay all right
[1:44:38] so that's what we won't find the father
[1:44:40] you heard our sister she has a drastic
[1:44:44] need in our life there Lord let it be
[1:44:47] this thing will bring for her the fact
[1:44:50] of children of God is real and concerned
[1:44:53] with even are these little trifle
[1:44:55] matters that we think of in life of our
[1:44:58] doing that he's right there so we ask
[1:45:01] you Father does this give our sister the
[1:45:03] right attitude of everything no matter
[1:45:06] what they say or do that she keeps it
[1:45:08] all in line we believe you we thank you
[1:45:12] Jesus son let's go believe it says
[1:45:16] anybody else
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:26] you might have a name
[1:45:31] the church do we believe what has been
[1:45:35] saying
[1:45:37] know what I mean the Bible of what said
[1:45:40] about the problem
[1:45:41] and the Ministry of design what a
[1:45:44] wonderful opportunity what a wonderful
[1:45:49] opportunity for you and I to believe
[1:45:54] that our Father is gonna take care of
[1:45:58] everything
[1:46:00] no matter what happened he's right on
[1:46:03] the scene and he'll bless him some
[1:46:07] carrots straight through lava cause
[1:46:09] we're his children
[1:46:11] where's children he's done everything he
[1:46:15] can do he sent us all of these things
[1:46:20] they become for the perfecting of the
[1:46:22] Saints that ain't time to make nobody
[1:46:25] perfect the way we think about it
[1:46:27] perfection means to bring it to a
[1:46:29] completion
[1:46:33] the five for ministry is to bring this
[1:46:36] thing to a completion the prophet has
[1:46:39] done his part we bring it to a
[1:46:42] completion through the fivefold ministry
[1:46:44] then God can step on the scene without
[1:46:47] 30 40 days to shout glory hallelujah and
[1:46:50] have a wonderful time from the
[1:46:52] resurrection to the ascension we're not
[1:46:59] going to sit around look what do you
[1:47:01] know what I think resurrection took
[1:47:02] place
[1:47:07] when they come back and told Peter them
[1:47:10] that Jesus had raised it was a good
[1:47:14] footrace
[1:47:16] who wouldn't I think John beat Peter
[1:47:18] liar Marat he's got a little younger he
[1:47:21] beat him nice but to show you how the
[1:47:24] connection is John know wonderful honey
[1:47:27] would we look at Peter Peter had done
[1:47:30] been given the keys of the kingdom
[1:47:31] Peter done been given that word and set
[1:47:33] an order in his life and went against
[1:47:35] our John goat and he just steps out of
[1:47:39] the way Peter goes running in and sees
[1:47:48] he was the guy that order been there
[1:47:51] because it was put in his hands God gave
[1:47:58] the fivefold ministry as gifts to the
[1:48:01] people
[1:48:04] not as something that we try to bad eye
[1:48:08] on our honor or something no something
[1:48:12] that we believe
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:14] then we believe
[1:48:17] we can say well when I get sick I'll
[1:48:19] call
[1:48:25] but we know who to call fivefold
[1:48:27] ministry all of these things are laid in
[1:48:32] our hands what are we gonna do it
[1:48:35] not looking for something to come we're
[1:48:37] looking right at what's taking place
[1:48:39] this is the greatest hour that had ever
[1:48:42] been upon this earth because you're
[1:48:45] gonna realize one day who you are and
[1:48:47] what you're here for
[1:48:49] and when you do is this gonna be short
[1:48:52] remember Jesus went to the Mount of
[1:48:55] Transfiguration tradeoff tricks
[1:48:57] figuration you went straight to Calvary
[1:49:01] it's not a long time draw it out when
[1:49:05] this is finished in the church realizing
[1:49:07] who it is and start moving real fast
[1:49:10] they'll all be finished but to be
[1:49:14] finished to those who know father we
[1:49:19] thank you for today and I pray that what
[1:49:21] we said we know that's been hard and
[1:49:24] different wordings and things but yet to
[1:49:26] say and to believe that you're the same
[1:49:29] yesterday today and forever and that the
[1:49:32] same God that was here on the shores of
[1:49:34] Galilee is the same God hearing his
[1:49:37] bride in the last days walking upon this
[1:49:40] earth and being polished by the word
[1:49:44] until we can walk off of this earth we
[1:49:47] love you and we thank you goddess and
