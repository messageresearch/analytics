[2:05] and I thought I
[2:08] Dreamed a Dream other night that brought
[2:10] it back to my mind
[2:13] and it it was
[2:15] people that was trying to do he and I
[2:18] bodily home at work and uh as long as he
[2:23] was there to take care of
[2:27] me they would not do
[2:30] anything but when I was left on my own
[2:33] they
[2:34] attacked and it it it brought back to my
[2:37] mind that you got to be able to stand on
[2:40] your own and not let me take care of you

[26:12] in it so I'm not worried about
[26:14] it maybe I was mentioned but it wasn't
[26:16] my name also another one and we've been
[26:19] talking about the n and Council dad had
[26:21] this in his library and it's written by
[26:24] a true
[26:27] Oneness uh
[26:29] he he's a a minister but he's he's
[26:31] Oneness he's he's not a trinitarian so
[26:34] he writes about n and the Nan Council
[26:37] it's like $7 on Amazon super neat read
[26:41] it tells you exactly how they formulated
[26:43] the Trinity how they come up with nas
[26:47] where they went to and it all comes all
[26:50] centers around the number
[26:53] three right but he keeps saying and
[26:57] refers to acts 238 and he even tells you
[27:00] when water baptism was changed uh from
[27:03] Jesus Christ to father son Holy Ghost
[27:05] all done in the Catholic church and this
[27:07] is a super book to read his name is uh
[27:09] Reverend Marvin Arnold and you get a
[27:12] screenshot you can see it or he is a
[27:15] he's written several books but this one
[27:17] right here we've been talking about Nan
[27:19] what happened at the Nan Council and he
[27:21] talks about Constantine and all the
[27:23] things he did it was really horrible the
[27:27] the the history books I know when we
[27:28] were growing up we we read about
[27:30] Constantine we read about the Crusades
[27:32] we that he was this good guy and he
[27:33] brought all that he was a
[27:36] devil the devil anointed that man to
[27:40] bring church and state together the
[27:41] church was about
[27:43] dead I'm not talking about the bride I'm
[27:45] not talking about the church age I'm
[27:47] talking about the church itself and what
[27:49] he done was he gave them political and
[27:52] spiritual power and give them all the
[27:55] places gave them all the money and said
[27:58] here let's build a kingdom and boy it's
[28:00] it really it opened my eyes and it's not
[28:03] very it's not very big they're thick so
[28:05] it's a good read so if you want to do
[28:07] that that's that's up to you Charles
[28:10] Spurgeon
[28:11] said have your heart right with
[28:14] Christ and he will visit you
[28:18] often so turn your weekends into
[28:21] Sundays turn your meals into
[28:24] sacraments turn your homes into temples
[28:28] and turn Earth into
[28:31] heaven Charles Spurgeon said that it's
[28:34] all in how you look at
[28:36] it so we're going to look into the word
[28:38] of God today and see what the Lord's got
[28:40] for us amen you love the Lord amen good
[28:43] to be in the house of the Lord so let's
[28:44] bow our heads dear heavenly father thank
[28:46] you today for all the things that you
[28:48] give us for the purpose that we have
[28:50] here Lord as we were talking about the
[28:52] the motorcycle riders that they were
[28:54] doing they got up this morning they
[28:55] prepared they knew what they were going
[28:57] to do they are going to ride and and and
[29:00] Lord we as Christians we got up this
[29:02] morning we prepared for the day we put
[29:04] on our good clothes and we come to
[29:06] church Lord to hear from you father
[29:08] something worthwhile something that has
[29:10] an eternal status to it not something
[29:12] that's temporal father I pray that you'd
[29:14] anoint us for that job that we have
[29:16] today Lord be with the ones that are
[29:18] sick that are not here we have many many
[29:20] that are traveling Lord in different
[29:21] places Lord I pray that you'd bless them
[29:24] Father just forgive us of our sins in
[29:25] Jesus name amen remember brother he's in
[29:28] Marian South Carolina and I cannot
[29:30] remember that young brother's name he's
[29:31] preaching for but that's where brother
[29:34] Bob is at today so let's turn our Bibles
[29:36] to the Book of Revelations and let's
[29:39] continue our thought this is the sardian
[29:41] church age but I don't know if we're
[29:42] going to get to it all today or not cu
[29:44] the uh I was studying yesterday
[29:46] afternoon at Dad's and the Lord just
[29:48] brought something back to my memory that
[29:50] we had spoken years and years ago and we
[29:53] want to cover that again so let's read
[29:56] Revelations 1:10 I was in the Spirit on
[29:58] the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[30:00] great voice as of a trumpet saying I am
[30:02] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[30:06] and what thou see us WR in the book and
[30:07] send it where send it to seven
[30:10] churches not seven Church
[30:13] buildings seven churches all right which
[30:17] are in Asia Ephesus smura pergamus thara
[30:19] Sardis Philadelphia and leosa which we
[30:21] are now in that church age and I turned
[30:25] to see the voice that spake with me and
[30:26] being turned I saw seven golden
[30:28] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[30:30] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[30:32] of man clothed with a garment down to
[30:34] the foot and G about to PS with a golden
[30:37] girdle you may be seated the Lord has
[30:39] took he has took that and he has
[30:41] transferred every bit of that onto his
[30:44] bride all that all that he's going to do
[30:47] he's going to give it to the bride now I
[30:49] want you to look at something real quick
[30:50] I was thinking about this
[30:53] yesterday let's read Revelations now
[30:55] this is we've come into the sardian
[30:57] church age but we're going to back up
[30:58] for a minute into the tharan age just
[31:01] for a moment and the angel of the church
[31:04] in Sardis write these things sayith he
[31:05] that hath the seven spirits of God and
[31:08] the Seven
[31:09] Stars now what are those Seven Stars
[31:11] those are the Seven Stars are seven
[31:14] Messengers all right in the hands of God
[31:17] not in the hands of the devil not in the
[31:19] hands of man not in the hands of
[31:21] denomination in the hands of God now
[31:24] remember a star gives its own light
[31:28] right but it it supposedly and I say
[31:31] before as as brother dick talks about
[31:32] the Big Bang Theory he says well who
[31:34] flipped the switch okay all right so
[31:36] this thing banged off of this one and
[31:38] brother Brown said clinkers went out but
[31:40] they had their own light but it come
[31:42] from the original light which was the s
[31:45] o n not the Su n so these seven didn't
[31:48] have their own idea they didn't have
[31:50] their own agenda they were God's people
[31:53] that's who worked in the process that
[31:56] God wanted in that time those were those
[31:58] seven stars and we know there were seven
[32:00] men all right and for those people that
[32:02] don't believe brother Ryan was a seventh
[32:03] Church age messenger God's got to send
[32:05] us one I'm waiting on him if he's not
[32:08] here cuz he told me before the great and
[32:10] dead Dreadful day of the Lord he'd send
[32:11] me Elijah the prophet so God's got to
[32:13] send me a seventh Church age messenger
[32:16] so you can you can decide who you want
[32:18] him to be I know one thing's for sure
[32:20] William Mar bram's that amen
[32:24] amen and I rest my soul on that I'm not
[32:27] looking for some else why in The
[32:28] Heavenly days would you want to look for
[32:29] something else I mean come on I know
[32:32] that's right too sister Regina through
[32:33] all that tissue you blowing your nose I
[32:36] know that's
[32:38] right but those seven stars but listen
[32:41] what what I was looking at yesterday
[32:43] those Seven Stars they give off light
[32:45] right all right now and we enjoy them
[32:47] because we look up and we see them in
[32:48] the in the in the sky all right and they
[32:50] are they are there they're sure and just
[32:53] as those seven men are sure all of them
[32:55] all the way from Paul all the way to
[32:57] brother random that's shy all right
[32:59] they're in the hand of God there is no
[33:01] one else in the hand of God there now
[33:03] but now
[33:04] remember listen that seven those seven
[33:08] stars are
[33:10] representing multitudes of people in the
[33:14] church
[33:16] ages so we're not just holding Seven
[33:18] Stars up and see we we we do rever those
[33:22] seven men but that's not all there is
[33:24] that's righten they have a light that
[33:26] they Shine On somebody well now listen
[33:29] if you are the light yourself you're
[33:31] part of that
[33:33] star that's right listen there part this
[33:36] message is a part of my life yes amen it
[33:39] is it is life you're right brother it is
[33:43] life see it is life but where does it
[33:45] come from it comes from that seven there
[33:47] had to be a messenger that stood and not
[33:50] seven seven in one time one at a time
[33:54] and one died and the other one come up
[33:56] one died the other one come up one the
[33:58] other one come up and then we remember
[33:59] we'll look at it in a minute on the
[34:00] chart where it lapped over that's what I
[34:02] was thinking about I thought man we we
[34:04] do rever the stars and we know who these
[34:06] men are but they had a message and they
[34:08] were
[34:10] nothing without a
[34:12] people they were nothing without a
[34:14] people to listen to it and to adhere to
[34:17] it and to say as sister Hatty said that
[34:19] ain't nothing but the truth amen we're
[34:22] just like Mary that said behold the
[34:24] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[34:26] according to Thy word send that seventh
[34:28] angel message I will if I'm bride I will
[34:31] attach myself to
[34:33] that praise the Lord eternity has got to
[34:37] connect with
[34:41] eternity praise the Lord but those Seven
[34:45] Stars we know who they
[34:46] are join to the angel of Sardis of the
[34:49] church which we know who that was that
[34:52] was Martin Luther I Know Thy works that
[34:55] thou Hast a name that thou livest and
[34:57] our dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[35:00] things which remain that they are ready
[35:02] to die that are ready to die for I have
[35:04] not found thy works perfect before God
[35:05] in other words there the the th tyan
[35:08] Church age we're going to talk about in
[35:09] just a second back up
[35:11] again is that they had works all right
[35:14] they had works and then God said do my
[35:16] works now this church age coming out of
[35:19] the tharan church age you got a group of
[35:22] people that has works but they're not
[35:25] perfect all right they've got works they
[35:28] got good works in there but they're not
[35:29] perfect why they took on a father son
[35:32] Holy Ghost baptism during this time they
[35:34] took on a trinitarian Doctrine during
[35:37] that time and they've made it
[35:40] Doctrine that's why you have to have a
[35:42] messenger that's why our messenger had
[35:44] to be a prophet cuz remember he got an
[35:47] alpha bride that was the alpha bride a
[35:50] prophet Paul was on the scene you got to
[35:52] have an Omega bride according to the
[35:53] Bible does everybody believe the Bible
[35:56] do you believe God changes his mind no
[35:57] he does not there's a alpha bride and
[36:00] the Omega Bride on this side and there
[36:03] got to be bookends so if God sent a
[36:05] prophet in the first church age he got
[36:07] to send a prophet because remember
[36:08] Luther and Wesley were not prophets they
[36:10] were reformers right amen they reformed
[36:14] the people they didn't return them back
[36:17] Malachi 4 restores back to the faith of
[36:20] this man right here Apostle Paul right
[36:23] and tell me where William Brandon missed
[36:25] it
[36:26] at no way
[36:30] amen I really don't care that they can't
[36:32] find he had there's 12 people fell off a
[36:34] bridge I don't care I don't care he
[36:37] brought God to me he brought this word
[36:40] to me he brought life to me yes sir his
[36:42] voice is a voice of God for this
[36:47] age my word people had fallacies we're
[36:49] going to read about Martin Luther Martin
[36:51] Luther started an Insurrection and had a
[36:52] bunch of people killed right Martin
[36:55] Luther
[36:59] they all had their fallacies they all
[37:00] had their well they were human that's
[37:04] right Paul killed
[37:06] Christians what do they say about him oh
[37:08] well he ain't no Prophet cuz he he don't
[37:11] act like one well you think he didn't
[37:13] because when he he put those people to
[37:15] death before he became a a born again
[37:18] believer but God used that person yes
[37:21] sir for I have not found thy works
[37:23] perfect before God remember therefore
[37:25] how thou Hast received and heard and
[37:27] hold hold fast and repent God gives time
[37:30] every Church age he rebukes him and he
[37:32] says I'm going to give you time to
[37:34] repent yes all right today God said I'm
[37:37] going to give you a time to repent right
[37:40] and repent if therefore Thou shalt not
[37:41] watch I will come to thee as a thief and
[37:43] thou shalt not know what hour I will
[37:45] come upon thee thou Hast a few names
[37:48] even in starst which have not defiled
[37:49] their garments all right there's a few
[37:51] people that are there and they shall
[37:53] walk with me in white for they are
[37:54] worthy he that overcometh the same shall
[37:57] be clothed and white rment coming out of
[37:59] that dirty Church age there's somebody
[38:01] that's going to be white yes right and I
[38:03] will not blot out his name out of the
[38:05] book of life but I will confess his name
[38:07] before my father as brother Luis was
[38:09] talking about the
[38:10] memorial we want God to
[38:12] say come on in my good and faithful
[38:16] servant I'm not going to remember those
[38:18] times that you lied I'm not going to
[38:19] remember hello somebody I'm not going to
[38:21] remember those times that you did this
[38:22] and that and the other I forgave you you
[38:25] asked for forgiveness I give it I told
[38:27] you to repent and you did but there's
[38:30] another group he's going to come up and
[38:31] they're going to say that and he's going
[38:32] to say you didn't repent I gave you time
[38:34] to repent and you
[38:36] didn't but I will confess his name
[38:38] before my father and before his angels
[38:40] He that I ear let him hear what the
[38:42] spirit says to the
[38:44] churches all
[38:49] right get rid of
[38:51] that
[38:55] Josh I don't know what that's all about
[38:58] anyway he that have to near let him hear
[39:00] what the spirit says to the churches I
[39:02] can't get this thing it's
[39:04] locked can't get it to move Luis did you
[39:07] should watch Luis he's like I run I do
[39:09] this computer thing and he's over I
[39:10] watch him he's just doing that me I
[39:13] touch it one time and it
[39:15] locks he got that little doohickey thing
[39:17] right there see
[39:25] that so I got a preach that all over
[39:28] again yeah oh
[39:32] okay brother Daniel I'm sure you're not
[39:34] going to have a problem with any of this
[39:35] you're not going to use this at all I'm
[39:37] sure right I didn't think so okay listen
[39:40] this never runs out of batteries it just
[39:42] stays hooked up all the time all right
[39:44] so we're good with that okay but we are
[39:48] for you to be able to see what we're
[39:49] talking
[39:50] about so there's the seven Church ages
[39:53] is everybody with me Paul irenius Martin
[39:56] Columba Luther Wesley
[39:57] and then the Elijah coming in the end
[39:59] time which was William brandham all
[40:01] right we see all the church ages there
[40:03] was a lap over we preach about the
[40:05] porter every Church age look those
[40:08] Church ages lap over and as we were as
[40:10] uh I was watching brother Tim pro it
[40:13] this morning he he brought out the same
[40:14] thing he said look whatever they get we
[40:16] get whatever bad they get that Devil's
[40:19] still here whatever good they got is
[40:21] here with us all right cuz those Church
[40:23] ages are lapped over they're not
[40:24] separated there was no separating time
[40:26] when it wasn't a on the earth there
[40:28] wasn't a separating time when there
[40:29] wasn't a messenger on the earth or
[40:31] people that carried that message cuz
[40:33] remember Columba died before 606 when
[40:37] his church age began so it had to be a
[40:39] group of people somebody had to get the
[40:41] Revelation and carry it for 900 years
[40:45] and the messenger was already off the
[40:46] scene we've had one off the scene 60
[40:49] years can't we carry the message that he
[40:51] preach and we got it Book and Tape for
[40:53] him Columba they just had to remember
[40:55] what he said
[40:58] praise the
[40:59] Lord for technology I mean really well
[41:05] sometimes but we know that that the
[41:07] anointings were the lion ox man and
[41:09] Eagle we're going to get into that in
[41:10] just a little bit there's something I
[41:11] want to talk to you about on that so now
[41:13] let's just review just for for the ones
[41:15] that were not here let's go to tharan
[41:18] church AIDS now this is where God said I
[41:20] Know Thy works and charity and service
[41:22] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[41:24] it keeps going thy Works thy works and
[41:26] the last be more than the first now
[41:29] watch what happened the last be more
[41:31] than the first in other words brother
[41:32] Daniel God said I'm going to have my
[41:34] people are going to be in the worst age
[41:36] but they're going to be better at the
[41:37] end than they were at the beginning now
[41:39] to me and you that's not that's
[41:41] not I mean we start with one toach and
[41:44] now we want three toach no we don't want
[41:47] that but you start with God and then you
[41:49] want more of God even though even though
[41:52] it looks like that that the ranks are
[41:53] thinning out and all this garbage is
[41:55] going on across the message the true
[41:58] bride will hold true every single time
[42:02] you've heard brother Dell say many times
[42:04] people say oh the bride looks bad the
[42:06] bride has never looked bad that's right
[42:08] you're looking at all that other garbage
[42:10] out there the other the other uh mixed
[42:14] multitude that ain't got the Holy Ghost
[42:17] you got the Holy Ghost you'll come to
[42:19] the word every time cuz the Holy Ghost
[42:21] can't find the Holy Ghost that's right
[42:23] they got to flow together all right and
[42:25] I will kill her children with death now
[42:27] we covered that I will kill her children
[42:29] with death you'd think you would say I
[42:31] will kill my children with a sword or
[42:32] I'll kill my children with this he said
[42:34] I'll kill her with death death is going
[42:36] to kill death he's given them a word
[42:39] that they could live by but they died by
[42:42] it
[42:43] right and all the churches shall know
[42:45] that I am he that searches the Reigns
[42:47] and hearts and I will give unto every
[42:48] one of you according to your works on
[42:51] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[42:54] works ah unto the end to him will I get
[42:57] power over the Nations now remember this
[43:01] is the ox age we had a lion first three
[43:04] ages the ox age was the middle age we've
[43:06] coming up to the man age which is going
[43:08] to be intelligence all right we'll talk
[43:10] about that later on not today but this
[43:13] Ox age is an age of Works what does an
[43:15] ox do an ox works all right a man he'll
[43:19] get he'll take his intelligence and
[43:21] he'll figure out a way to let somebody
[43:22] else do it or let a piece of Machinery
[43:25] do it but the ox just know know I got a
[43:28] plow so put the thing on me and I'm
[43:29] going to plow well that's what they did
[43:31] in that fourth Church age they plowed
[43:32] through that church age but it was God
[43:35] in those
[43:36] people James 2 ver1 17 says if so faith
[43:40] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[43:43] you got to put the two together yes sir
[43:45] all
[43:46] right yeah a man may say thou H has
[43:49] faith and I have Works show me thy faith
[43:51] without thy works and I will show thee
[43:53] my faith by my Works amen for as the
[43:56] body with the spirit is dead so faith
[43:58] without works is dead also in other
[44:01] words faith is in motion faith is
[44:04] something that we do if we have faith in
[44:06] something we're going to do it if you
[44:08] don't have faith in something you're
[44:10] going to not do it until you learn how
[44:12] to do it and then you'll do it I do not
[44:14] have faith that I can take that panel
[44:16] off of that Electrical uh door over
[44:19] there and just start moving stuff around
[44:22] I have no faith in that
[44:25] whatsoever amen but a master electrician
[44:28] some of you too brother Aaron different
[44:30] ones you can go over there and say oh
[44:31] that goes here this goes here this goes
[44:33] here and you're totally safe with it why
[44:35] you have faith in come on somebody you
[44:37] have faith in what you learned you have
[44:39] faith in what you were taught right if I
[44:42] had been taught to be a master
[44:44] electrician that wouldn't be a problem
[44:46] to me if you've been taught right in the
[44:48] word of God these Revelations that's
[44:51] coming you're not going to have a
[44:53] problem with and these falsities that's
[44:56] coming you not not have a problem with
[44:57] them
[45:00] either all
[45:03] right and brother Brown says look now
[45:05] the two men that were talking on faith
[45:07] Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw
[45:10] in Abraham but James Justified Abraham
[45:13] by what man
[45:14] saw in Abraham see now James says he's
[45:18] justified by his Works Paul said he's
[45:20] justified by faith but see Abraham
[45:23] believed God and it was what God saw in
[45:25] him God saw the the heart of Abram to
[45:28] begin with and then he developed into
[45:31] Abraham right he believed it yes but
[45:35] then when he went to acting as though it
[45:36] was already done that's what man saw in
[45:39] him he kept saying I'm going to have a
[45:41] baby I'm going to have a baby I'm going
[45:42] to have a baby 25 years I'm going to
[45:44] have a baby I'm going to have a baby
[45:45] guess what one day his faith produced
[45:49] what he
[45:50] believed amen you just hang on what you
[45:53] got now you got to have faith in it
[45:55] though you got to have faith in it when
[45:57] you have faith in it just hang
[46:00] on hang on for your children wife
[46:03] husband mother who no no no
[46:12] no but
[46:13] remember here's our
[46:15] problem we try to save our
[46:18] kids we try to figure out a
[46:22] way to manipulate them in the
[46:25] church my Mama Tried it for 20 years and
[46:28] didn't
[46:29] work oh it's
[46:32] Easter Mr Debbie it's Easter C they
[46:35] always remind you hey Tim it's
[46:37] Easter M it's Mother's Day
[46:42] you you don't have to do that
[46:46] anymore because now I believe that every
[46:49] day is an
[46:51] Easter every day is a memorial day every
[46:54] day is a Victory Day every day that we
[46:57] live as Spurgeon said we ought to make
[47:00] every day a
[47:01] Sunday Abraham believed God that's what
[47:04] God saw in him he believed it but then
[47:05] when he went to acting as though it was
[47:07] already done so Abraham comes to a time
[47:09] when Abram could produce what he
[47:12] said he got with Hagar got with the
[47:14] wrong
[47:15] person it's kind of our problem sometime
[47:17] we get with the wrong person and we
[47:19] produce a wild child all right but when
[47:22] Abraham got
[47:24] 99 he was dead
[47:27] and you know what he done one day I
[47:28] believe he said God I'm dead I tried to
[47:31] figure this thing out for 25 years you
[47:34] you I thought we did it with Hagar I
[47:36] thought we did it here I thought I I
[47:38] thought you were here with me and I met
[47:40] you when I in in the uh when we went to
[47:43] the slaughter of the Kings I met you you
[47:44] gave me
[47:46] communion I'm
[47:48] done I can't do it no more and God said
[47:51] that's exactly where I want you to be
[47:52] right there cuz I'm going to come in the
[47:55] plains of mammory
[47:57] I'm going to come and I'm going to bring
[47:58] a message to you and say look your
[48:01] name's not going to be Abram anymore
[48:02] your name's not going to be lost anymore
[48:05] your name's going to be Christian and
[48:07] you're going to be
[48:13] changed this message is not
[48:17] just oh God never mind it makes a
[48:21] change it changes your thought process
[48:24] that's why some people can't handle it
[48:26] amen it's not from this world this is
[48:31] eternal we're trying to do it with a
[48:33] finite mind that's why Paul said get the
[48:36] mind of Christ then you'll understand
[48:38] what he's talking about cuz Paul said
[48:40] look I didn't have the mind of
[48:43] Christ I had the mind of a
[48:46] denomination I had the mind of the Old
[48:48] Testament sure it was good for that time
[48:51] but God moved through those Commandments
[48:53] and he came and died at Calvary Paul
[48:55] didn't see that right Saul was blinded
[48:58] to that but when Saul turned into Paul
[49:03] and he got the mind of Christ he said oh
[49:05] my what a Wretched Man that I am oh this
[49:08] body is just it's it's
[49:11] horrible but I thank
[49:13] God through Jesus Christ who has given
[49:16] me the victory oh death where's your
[49:18] sting oh grave where's your Victory the
[49:22] Apostle Paul told us
[49:25] that that's the same it is to us because
[49:28] our works watch our works Express what
[49:30] faith we have like I said before you're
[49:34] not going to see me go over there and
[49:35] open that panel up and try to fix that
[49:37] electrical
[49:39] panel but a master electrician will show
[49:42] you his faith in what he's doing by
[49:46] going over there and working on it
[49:49] right but if we're afraid to act on what
[49:52] we believe there's the whole
[49:54] thing if we're afraid to act on what we
[49:57] believe then we do not believe
[50:01] it pretty simple pretty simple you just
[50:05] don't believe it and listen this message
[50:08] and this listen this is the message
[50:09] don't talk about 1100 books this right
[50:12] here is for believers people that
[50:14] believe that God's going to do what he
[50:17] said that's what was down to the church
[50:19] ages they believed they didn't have they
[50:22] didn't have they Harley didn't have
[50:23] books come on they had to depend on on
[50:26] somebody to preach the gospel to them
[50:29] and they said that ain't nothing but the
[50:30] truth cuz the Holy Ghost was inside of
[50:32] them right and in in in Martin Luther's
[50:35] day it was the just shall live by faith
[50:36] I don't have to do penants anymore I
[50:39] don't have to
[50:41] pay I was reading a book
[50:44] yesterday there was a man he wrote a
[50:47] book called the 50 years in the Roman
[50:49] Catholic Church he became a priest but
[50:51] before he became a priest he was a child
[50:53] and he was part of the Catholic system
[50:56] well his daddy died and the and the wife
[50:59] was left with him and that was it him
[51:01] and her him and her and I think it was
[51:03] maybe a
[51:05] sister so the priest comes and instead
[51:07] of giving them hope and instead of
[51:11] giving them something to sustain him
[51:13] with he says oh you need to pay for this
[51:17] Penance you need to pay Penance because
[51:19] your your husband is in purgatory
[51:23] burning and she's like I don't have a
[51:25] dime
[51:27] my husband was a so bread winner the
[51:29] only thing I have is a cow that gives us
[51:31] milk and butter to sustain our life the
[51:35] priest took
[51:37] it the priest took it this is
[51:40] true the priest took it cuz that's what
[51:43] the woman said all I got is this cow he
[51:45] said okay I'll take it and they he said
[51:47] he watched him he laid it right onto his
[51:50] house that's the kind of religion the
[51:53] Catholic church is you don't have to pay
[51:56] penants to get out of
[51:57] hell
[51:59] yeah but remember if you believe
[52:03] something you got to believe
[52:06] it what's your faith in
[52:11] today my Faith's in the word of
[52:14] God I know th works in the last to be
[52:17] more than the first this is Brother R
[52:18] I'm speaking this is certainly
[52:19] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[52:22] increased as the honor rooll of the
[52:24] martyrs grew lengthier by the day they
[52:26] by day they worked all the harder they
[52:29] served all the more and their faith
[52:33] increased we get a problem we scatter
[52:35] like
[52:40] chickens I don't know what to do go to
[52:43] church read your Bible
[52:46] pray I don't know
[52:49] about ain't that what we do though as as
[52:53] when we when we're we're teetering and
[52:54] wavering a little bit we get first
[52:56] little problem we we don't go to church
[52:59] and we like I said before check all your
[53:02] boxes right all
[53:04] right because it ain't the preacher's
[53:07] problem it starts with
[53:11] you and mind starts with me but they
[53:14] served all the more and their faith
[53:16] increased let the enemy attempt to
[53:18] thwart our service to the Lord our reply
[53:21] is increased service Satan doesn't know
[53:22] how to handle that that's one thing
[53:24] Satan don't know how to handle cuz when
[53:26] he does to somebody out there they fall
[53:29] apart as I said before what I got
[53:31] written in my Bible tragedy defines a
[53:33] Christian it does not destroy
[53:36] them it defined who job
[53:39] was tragedy none of you have lived
[53:42] through that tragedy not one of you left
[53:45] left every lost every child all your
[53:48] belongings your cattle your horses your
[53:51] cars he lost everything all he had was a
[53:54] wife and a pile of Ashes
[53:57] right
[54:01] right though God slay me yet I'll trust
[54:05] him his faith was stronger and Satan
[54:08] said Satan said now I I'm going to make
[54:11] him curse you he never
[54:14] did so Satan was the one walking away
[54:16] doing this scratching his head I think
[54:19] he might have moved on to somebody else
[54:20] cuz he was done with that one he
[54:21] couldn't do anything to that
[54:23] one ain't that what brother R said you s
[54:26] we want to be at a place where Satan
[54:27] doesn't know what to do with
[54:29] us cuz we're so totally contrary to the
[54:32] world we're we should be contrary to the
[54:35] thinking of the
[54:37] world separated from the world think
[54:39] different act different dress
[54:42] different and we do it from the heart
[54:44] not from the
[54:45] letter let the enemy attempt to th our
[54:48] service to the Lord our reprise in
[54:49] increase service when the faint are
[54:51] crying in fear that is the time to shout
[54:53] the
[54:53] victory th IR in church age I want to
[54:56] give you a warning right here it says
[54:57] concerning the last days that because of
[54:59] abounding
[55:03] iniquity that's somebody tell me the
[55:04] other day said I know it says I need to
[55:07] go to
[55:09] church okay and you don't show up that's
[55:13] iniquity cuz you're confessing you
[55:17] know and that's iniquity that's why
[55:19] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[55:21] wax cold and the lay out of sin or last
[55:23] age selflove
[55:27] selfie sticks they didn't have them
[55:29] except for this
[55:31] age hello somebody in the L toy in the
[55:35] last days self- Lov and the love for
[55:37] material things will take the place of
[55:38] the true love of God we need to guard
[55:40] against the power of sin in those last
[55:42] days so many are getting so hard because
[55:44] they haven't realized the effect of this
[55:46] last day
[55:48] Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God
[55:50] and let him fill our lives fill our
[55:52] lives with his love or we will F the
[55:56] cold ESS of the last day
[55:58] church and reject the truth of God which
[56:01] alone is able to help us that's
[56:05] right now remember as we started just a
[56:08] background for some of the the brother
[56:10] Daniel and them that weren't here every
[56:12] Church age that
[56:14] began in Ephesus there was a worship of
[56:18] a woman all right so then you got her
[56:21] name was Diana then you had tharan age
[56:24] we read the other Sunday day where there
[56:27] was a propheus that sat on a three-leg
[56:29] stool hello somebody on a three-legged
[56:32] stool and prophesied she didn't have
[56:35] nothing to do with the with the the
[56:36] going of the th tyan AE no it was it was
[56:39] what devil worship all right then in our
[56:42] age we see Satan is so slick and if
[56:46] you'll read this book he's so
[56:49] subtle he just slips little things in
[56:51] little sayings and slips this in and
[56:53] slips this in cuz that that brother C
[56:56] covers that he says as for brother Dale
[56:59] brother Brandon and all of them quote
[57:00] that they took down Zeus and put up Paul
[57:03] they took down this one and put up Peter
[57:05] they just transferred all that paganism
[57:09] right into
[57:10] Christianity right but it all come from
[57:13] the woman worship Diana the first one in
[57:16] the first church age tharra there was a
[57:18] propheus we're going to see that this
[57:20] next age coming up is going to be sael
[57:23] which is a woman and then you're going
[57:25] to find out that had transferred from
[57:27] from that woman had a son and the son
[57:30] was supposed to be the one the chosen
[57:32] one and then they done away with him and
[57:34] now they have mother worship that's
[57:36] exactly what it is so our age culminates
[57:39] in what it brings it into Christianity
[57:42] the great and her daughters all
[57:45] right so everybody with me and I will
[57:47] kill her children with death God said
[57:49] this God said I'll kill him cuz I'm
[57:52] going to give him a chance to repent
[57:54] he's G us a chance to repent you better
[57:57] turn around and go somewhere
[58:00] different cuz I'm going to kill you with
[58:02] spiritual death first and then when you
[58:04] die spiritually there's a second death
[58:06] you got to worry with amen right the
[58:11] Bible says blessed is he that doesn't
[58:14] have to come to that second
[58:15] death we'll read it in just a second and
[58:17] I will kill the children with death and
[58:19] all the churches shall know that I am he
[58:21] who searches the Reigns and hearts and I
[58:23] will give unto every one of you
[58:24] according to your Works 1 Timothy 5:6
[58:28] but she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[58:31] while she liveth those people that
[58:34] formulated that Nan counsil formulated
[58:36] the Pope the the mother worship and all
[58:39] those they call it
[58:41] mariology now Mary has been exalted
[58:43] above Jesus and you just pray to her you
[58:45] don't have to worry about
[58:48] him this is so slick in that book and
[58:51] I'll get the name of the of the author
[58:53] but he was a he was a Catholic priest
[58:57] right for 25 years and then he come out
[58:59] and for 25 years he's been Christian now
[59:01] this has been in the late 1800s but he
[59:04] said they would set them down as kids
[59:06] and this is how they formulated the
[59:09] worship of Mary they say
[59:12] son who beats you at
[59:14] home and he would say my father well who
[59:18] intercedes for you if your father gets
[59:20] too rough oh Mom
[59:22] does well who comforts you when you're
[59:25] sick uh father no no no mother you see
[59:29] how they formulate in that child's mind
[59:31] that the mother is the one you got to go
[59:33] to who do you go to with your problems
[59:35] do you go to your dad no I don't go to
[59:36] my dad I go to my
[59:38] mom you see how slick that is they
[59:42] inserted that mother worship right in
[59:44] there forget about the son worship the
[59:47] mama cuz she's so good
[59:56] thire and church
[59:58] age I will cast her into bed it will be
[1:00:01] a bed of tribulation of the Great
[1:00:03] Tribulation that's what will come upon
[1:00:04] the Harlot and her daughters secondly it
[1:00:06] says that he will kill them with death
[1:00:08] or as a literal translation says let
[1:00:11] them be put to death with death or by
[1:00:15] death wow let them be put to death with
[1:00:19] death this is a strange saying we might
[1:00:21] say let a man be put to death by hanging
[1:00:22] execution or some other way but say let
[1:00:25] them be put to death by death death
[1:00:27] itself is the cause of their
[1:00:29] death spiritual death came in the minute
[1:00:32] the First Church of Rome organized it
[1:00:37] died the minute that the Luther
[1:00:39] organized death came in they died the
[1:00:42] Pentecostals came along last they
[1:00:44] organized the spirit left there's a lot
[1:00:46] of Pentecostals sitting there I'm sure
[1:00:47] they were mad at him the spirit left
[1:00:50] though they don't believe it but he did
[1:00:52] that marriage brought death then the
[1:00:55] light of the one of the godhead came
[1:00:56] they organized and they died too then
[1:00:58] after the fire of God fell on Ohio River
[1:01:00] 1933 now he's bringing his message a
[1:01:03] healing Revival swept the world but it
[1:01:04] never came through any organization God
[1:01:07] went outside the Pentecostal group
[1:01:09] outside of organization and what he's
[1:01:11] going to do in the future is going to be
[1:01:12] outside organization anybody with me God
[1:01:15] can't work through the
[1:01:20] dead he can only work through the living
[1:01:23] members
[1:01:26] those living members are outside of
[1:01:29] Babylon so you see death organization
[1:01:31] came and the church died or to make it
[1:01:33] pler death became a
[1:01:37] resident now when you have somebody come
[1:01:39] and visit you they're visitors right but
[1:01:42] when you have someone residing in your
[1:01:43] house they live there everybody with me
[1:01:47] all right we call them residents at the
[1:01:49] post office because that's where they
[1:01:50] live it's a
[1:01:52] residency or to make it plain or death
[1:01:55] became a resident wherein shortly before
[1:01:58] only life reigned as the original eeve
[1:02:01] brought death to mankind so now
[1:02:02] organization has brought death for
[1:02:04] organization is the product of the
[1:02:06] double corruptors nicolinis and bism and
[1:02:09] he covers that here in this book didn't
[1:02:11] call it that but you can read it
[1:02:13] propagated by what a
[1:02:16] woman or a dominating
[1:02:20] female now the word death means what
[1:02:23] that separation natural or violent of
[1:02:25] the soul in the body by which the life
[1:02:27] on Earth is ended now that's death as we
[1:02:29] know it as we're going to have a funeral
[1:02:31] next
[1:02:33] Thursday but the Bible says you're dead
[1:02:35] while you're living if you take on that
[1:02:36] organizational thought or idea outside
[1:02:39] the word of God you're sitting here
[1:02:41] alive as brother R said about that woman
[1:02:43] that that was half naked crawling down
[1:02:46] the um the uh where was she she was in a
[1:02:49] Howard Johnson or something and she was
[1:02:51] having a party buddy this is life she
[1:02:53] said brother R said he didn't she didn't
[1:02:54] know that she was dead
[1:03:00] amen so now let's cover this real quick
[1:03:02] this is where I wanted to back up to cuz
[1:03:04] we're going to look at the opening of
[1:03:05] the seals later on but God through a
[1:03:08] prophet told us that that God was going
[1:03:11] to open the seals up to us in this age
[1:03:14] right uh Paul never preached on them
[1:03:17] irenius all the different
[1:03:20] ones even John the Revelator he wrote
[1:03:22] about them but he didn't preach about
[1:03:24] them Paul was already dead when the
[1:03:26] seals
[1:03:27] came to be written down so they had to
[1:03:30] be shut up as in Daniel says to the time
[1:03:33] of the end so that people can understand
[1:03:35] them all right so to understand them we
[1:03:39] brother brandom simply broke it down to
[1:03:42] the first seal second seal third seal
[1:03:45] fourth seal and then the Rapture of the
[1:03:48] church all right I'm going to slow down
[1:03:49] just a second right the Rapture of the
[1:03:52] church happens on the fourth seal
[1:03:53] because what the combat Beast
[1:03:56] the four line ox man and Eagle which is
[1:03:59] the Holy Ghost in you today the believer
[1:04:02] is gone right fifth seal doesn't say
[1:04:05] come and
[1:04:07] see so therefore the Rapture takes place
[1:04:10] on the fourth seal so now you can't take
[1:04:12] though the church ages and put them all
[1:04:15] together with the seals you got to look
[1:04:17] and see that the first three Ages was
[1:04:19] the lion brother I'm going explain
[1:04:22] it all right the ox age is right here
[1:04:26] one age the big long one man is Luther
[1:04:29] Wesley and then Elijah is the eagle
[1:04:32] anointing all right is everybody with me
[1:04:34] all right so now
[1:04:37] listen so we're going to see the first
[1:04:41] seal the second
[1:04:43] seal third and
[1:04:46] fourth cuz we because we're raptured
[1:04:48] after that there's no more the fifth
[1:04:50] sixth and seventh seal we'll talk about
[1:04:52] it later it laps back into the seals
[1:04:55] right everybody with me spiritually
[1:04:58] spiritually brother R said spiritually
[1:04:59] they were they were preached in the
[1:05:01] Feast of the trumpet spiritually you got
[1:05:03] to think
[1:05:05] spiritual so now let's look at this real
[1:05:07] quick let's go to Revelation 6 verse
[1:05:10] one and I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:05:12] of the seals now here's the opening of
[1:05:14] the seals the seals fixing to
[1:05:16] open and brother BR said they opened in
[1:05:19] the church ages and we believe that cuz
[1:05:21] I see them open all right and I saw when
[1:05:24] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[1:05:26] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[1:05:28] one of the four beasts which was what
[1:05:30] the lion saying come and see right and I
[1:05:35] saw Behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:05:38] on him had a bow remember brother
[1:05:40] Brandon was confused on
[1:05:41] this boy people don't amen that much but
[1:05:44] he said he was okay I'll read it to you
[1:05:46] in J J's book I mean in the seal book he
[1:05:49] said he was confused on that cuz he
[1:05:51] thought that was the white horse rider
[1:05:53] was the Holy Ghost or the mighty
[1:05:55] conqueror
[1:05:56] but the book hadn't been open all the
[1:05:58] way so the book now is open hello
[1:06:01] somebody the mighty Angel come down with
[1:06:03] a book in his hand he didn't give it to
[1:06:05] brother brandham he gave it to
[1:06:09] John brother brandham was a mouthpiece
[1:06:12] that Christ used to get this to
[1:06:19] us and you and I are the beneficiaries
[1:06:21] of it if you'll accept it if you don't
[1:06:23] then it's not for you anyway
[1:06:26] I saw him behold now watch this is John
[1:06:28] sees a sea Behold a white horse and he
[1:06:31] that sat on him had a bow oh boy looks
[1:06:33] good looking
[1:06:36] good but don't say anything about
[1:06:40] Arrow who go hunting how'd you like to
[1:06:43] go grizzly bear hunting with I got my
[1:06:45] bow dude you go over y under I'll
[1:06:48] probably have to bury you somewhere but
[1:06:50] you're going over that way I'm going
[1:06:51] over here with my with my uh bow and
[1:06:54] arrow
[1:06:57] and a crown was given now look a crown
[1:06:58] was given he didn't come with one he was
[1:07:00] given one and he went forth conquering
[1:07:04] and to conquer now look in those first
[1:07:07] three ages watch what Satan did he
[1:07:10] bluffed his way into the true white
[1:07:12] righteous Church there was a true church
[1:07:15] the first three ages they had the power
[1:07:17] of the lion anointing they were bold
[1:07:19] they had Jesus had just come off went
[1:07:21] off the scene and come back onto day
[1:07:23] Pentecost and a group of Believers that
[1:07:26] had no denomination they weren't worried
[1:07:28] about an Nia
[1:07:29] Council they were getting people to
[1:07:36] Christ but remember when God rides
[1:07:40] out Satan rides right with
[1:07:42] him Satan rides right with him and looks
[1:07:45] just like him he bluffed them into
[1:07:47] believing that was the white righteous
[1:07:50] Church of the first three Church agents
[1:07:52] when it was not it was Satan he was a
[1:07:54] bluff he was sitting on a horse with a
[1:07:56] bow no arrows nothing to shoot you
[1:08:00] with and a crown was given to him what
[1:08:02] by the people right everybody with me
[1:08:06] and he went forth conquering into
[1:08:07] conquer in other words he started out
[1:08:09] even the great Paul irenius and Martin
[1:08:12] they they went to all these different
[1:08:13] places and established churches so did
[1:08:15] the
[1:08:18] devil and some people's like this is
[1:08:22] it and it
[1:08:24] wasn't Satan bluffed them into believing
[1:08:27] they were alive when they were
[1:08:30] dead all right but there is a boldness
[1:08:33] of the lion l o n the lion the first
[1:08:35] three ages that first seal we see that
[1:08:39] was a white righteous Church there was a
[1:08:42] there was a church AG or there was three
[1:08:44] Church ages that had power they had bow
[1:08:46] and
[1:08:48] Aras and they conquered the world for
[1:08:51] Christ during that time but Satan was
[1:08:53] riding the same time with them on a
[1:08:55] white righteous Church
[1:08:57] horse and he bluffed his way into those
[1:09:00] first three ages cuz what happened at
[1:09:02] the end of that third age NAA comes
[1:09:06] in everybody with me this is the
[1:09:08] culmination of what Satan's going to do
[1:09:10] right here now what's he going to do the
[1:09:13] first the first church or the first
[1:09:16] three
[1:09:17] Ages was
[1:09:20] white okay now remember Satan's going to
[1:09:24] get off his white horse
[1:09:27] and he's going to get on a red
[1:09:30] horse for the middle Church age which is
[1:09:33] the fourth Church age all right now
[1:09:37] watch Revelation 6:3 and when he had
[1:09:40] opened the second seal I heard the
[1:09:42] second beast the O say come and see all
[1:09:46] right everybody with me here all right
[1:09:48] and they went out another horse now what
[1:09:51] is a horse a horse is a
[1:09:53] power and Satan just jumped up on that
[1:09:56] horse hello
[1:09:59] somebody and power was given
[1:10:05] him permitted
[1:10:07] power was given him that sat there on to
[1:10:10] take peace from the
[1:10:12] earth and that they should what kill one
[1:10:16] another remember died to death death by
[1:10:20] death and there was given unto him a
[1:10:22] great sword now look and the first time
[1:10:24] over here here you're going to see he
[1:10:26] had a bow with no arrows he couldn't do
[1:10:28] anything he's a bluff but now God allows
[1:10:33] him to pick up a
[1:10:37] sword listen you live by the sword you
[1:10:40] die by the sword didn't he tell Peter
[1:10:42] that pretty much put sword up Peter this
[1:10:45] is not this not your battle all right
[1:10:47] but he was given a great sword or a
[1:10:49] great word that came out of a
[1:10:52] council hello we we're heading out of
[1:10:54] the Third Church age into the fourth
[1:10:56] Church age everybody with
[1:10:58] me fourth Church age is
[1:11:01] thyra and they went out a horse that was
[1:11:04] red now what happened during the tharan
[1:11:07] church
[1:11:09] age 68 million Christians were killed
[1:11:14] talk about blood talk about
[1:11:16] [Applause]
[1:11:17] red let's read what the prophet said
[1:11:19] about that then we're going to get to
[1:11:21] the third seal later on when we go to
[1:11:23] the man age which would be the Lutheran
[1:11:24] Wesley
[1:11:25] are the third seal which is the black
[1:11:29] horse
[1:11:30] amen you said well I think it should be
[1:11:33] God didn't ask you your
[1:11:35] opinion the red horse is over here the
[1:11:37] killing the listen the Blackness of that
[1:11:41] third of that fourth and or the fifth
[1:11:43] and sixth age was that man took over
[1:11:45] denominations came in there was all kind
[1:11:48] of ideas happened that was
[1:11:51] black now let's go to the second seal
[1:11:54] when the slain risen L risen lamb opened
[1:11:57] it and the second calf Beast said come
[1:12:01] see what the seal mystery is now we get
[1:12:04] it the lamb you remember has to open
[1:12:06] every seal now remember the Lamb's a guy
[1:12:09] that stands there with the Seven Stars
[1:12:10] in his hand so he's got control about
[1:12:12] all this all right thank God not not we
[1:12:14] don't he does now we get it the lamb you
[1:12:17] remember has to open every seal and the
[1:12:19] second beast second beast
[1:12:24] ox if you notice in the routine of what
[1:12:26] we just went through with the church
[1:12:28] ages the same thing he he reverts you
[1:12:30] right back to the church ages so I don't
[1:12:32] understand why people won't read a
[1:12:33] church age book they're denying a lot of
[1:12:36] the
[1:12:37] message people deny a lot of the message
[1:12:40] anyway so look now the first was a lion
[1:12:43] right he backs up a little bit the first
[1:12:46] was a lion next was a was a calf or ox
[1:12:49] or something you see and this Beast said
[1:12:52] come see now when the lamb opened the
[1:12:54] seal and then when went to see and when
[1:12:56] he walked in what happened let's see
[1:12:58] what we found come see there's a mystery
[1:13:00] sealed up here that's been here now for
[1:13:03] 2,000 years about let's see what it is
[1:13:06] now we find here that he saw what a red
[1:13:09] horse go
[1:13:11] forward everybody with me on that now
[1:13:14] brother B said look
[1:13:16] notice that sure show they they should
[1:13:19] kill one another they should kill each
[1:13:21] other his bow had no arrows at first so
[1:13:24] the first three ages there wasn't any
[1:13:25] killing that was just bluffing the
[1:13:27] people into believing that they the the
[1:13:29] devil was right everybody with me white
[1:13:32] righteous Church White Power all right
[1:13:36] now we getting into a red
[1:13:38] horse his bow had no Arrow at first but
[1:13:42] his great sword
[1:13:44] did he done his killing later and
[1:13:47] changed from White Horse to a red horse
[1:13:49] the same exact Devil with his sword what
[1:13:53] did Jesus say Jesus said they that take
[1:13:55] the sword will perish by it don't fight
[1:13:57] back see Jesus that night when he told
[1:13:59] Peter took the sword said just just do
[1:14:01] like he did just go ahead now remember
[1:14:04] he's got a
[1:14:05] sword he's going forth with a sword in
[1:14:08] his hand riding a red horse waiting
[1:14:12] through the blood of everybody that
[1:14:13] disagrees with him right now do you
[1:14:17] understand it how many understands what
[1:14:19] that seal is now what it was the middle
[1:14:21] Church age the the th tyan Church age
[1:14:23] now what did Jesus say that take up the
[1:14:25] sword we'll perish By The Sword is that
[1:14:27] right all right this writer and all his
[1:14:29] kingdom subjects that are slain down
[1:14:31] through the age that's draw all this
[1:14:33] Blood of the martyrs remember he's
[1:14:34] referring to Revelation where it talks
[1:14:36] about the cup the great whoree the cup
[1:14:39] she's standing there with a cup that's
[1:14:40] full of blood that's running over
[1:14:42] because they killed so many people
[1:14:44] because they didn't believe in the
[1:14:45] Catholic
[1:14:48] Church 68
[1:14:50] million Josh what was that Josh looked
[1:14:53] up the other day 68 8 million people is
[1:14:56] California and Texas if you take those
[1:14:58] two states there's 68 million people in
[1:14:59] those two
[1:15:00] states Catholic Church wiped them all
[1:15:02] out it's like you took everybody out of
[1:15:04] Texas and killed them and everybody out
[1:15:05] of California and killed them that's 68
[1:15:07] million
[1:15:09] people and they got it written
[1:15:12] down it ain't here say it's written down
[1:15:16] in their
[1:15:18] mology dra all this Blood of the martyrs
[1:15:21] of the Saints will be slain By The Sword
[1:15:23] of Jesus Christ when he comes
[1:15:26] they that take the sword will slain be
[1:15:27] slain By The Sword they took the sword
[1:15:29] of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the
[1:15:32] real true worshipers all down Through
[1:15:34] the Ages by the millions and when Christ
[1:15:36] comes with the sword for it is his word
[1:15:38] that proceeds out of his mouth I am
[1:15:40] telling you that's in this age right
[1:15:43] he's got his sword in his hand in this
[1:15:46] age for it is his word that proceedes
[1:15:49] out of his mouth he will slay every
[1:15:51] enemy there is before him you believe it
[1:15:53] kill the enemy
[1:15:55] brother Ernie says hack them whack
[1:15:59] them whatever else he said now watch
[1:16:03] what did Jesus say he that takes the
[1:16:05] sword all right red horse here's what
[1:16:06] she's coming now watch you might have
[1:16:09] killed 68 million of them down Through
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:12] Ages since then maybe more but Jesus
[1:16:15] said he that takes the sword will perish
[1:16:17] by it watch as the Impostors against the
[1:16:19] word of God and because they didn't
[1:16:22] agree in these things Satan placed
[1:16:24] United the political power which he held
[1:16:26] and the spiritual power which he held
[1:16:28] together and made a church now he tells
[1:16:31] you about this right exactly where they
[1:16:32] married it's in this book it's really
[1:16:34] good book and he put Millions times
[1:16:37] Millions not just a few hundred
[1:16:39] millions after he jumped look after he
[1:16:42] jumped from his White Horse onto his red
[1:16:45] horse and he took his sword and went
[1:16:48] forth but God said the same thing that
[1:16:50] he perverted tried to the false teaching
[1:16:53] that same word were in
[1:16:56] power
[1:16:59] today coming forth from the lips of
[1:17:01] Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and
[1:17:03] everything before him amen there's the
[1:17:06] second seal do you love him oh my that's
[1:17:08] thus sayith the Lord praise be to God
[1:17:10] now on the third seal he reverts back
[1:17:11] now watch this is this is neat then
[1:17:13] we'll then we'll
[1:17:16] stop now what was he given then first he
[1:17:19] had a bow but he didn't have any arrows
[1:17:21] but now he's got a mighty sword in his
[1:17:23] hand he can do something
[1:17:26] now then he jumps off his White Horse
[1:17:28] the white horse rides on out now he
[1:17:30] straddles what a red horse blood blood
[1:17:33] blood red horse he really rides that one
[1:17:36] oh sure now he's given great power and
[1:17:38] great sword to kill then he rides his
[1:17:40] blood white blood red horse we see from
[1:17:43] the second seal that was broke last
[1:17:45] night he taken peace from the earth and
[1:17:47] killed one another and his own mology of
[1:17:50] the Roman Catholic Church shows that
[1:17:52] they put 68 million Protestants not just
[1:17:55] vagrants not
[1:17:57] just professed Christians true
[1:18:00] Christians were put to death because
[1:18:03] they wouldn't do penants they wouldn't
[1:18:04] do the that's what so mirac the reason
[1:18:05] I'm reading this really is so miraculous
[1:18:08] that Martin Luther was in that
[1:18:10] system hello Martin Luther was a Die
[1:18:13] Hard
[1:18:14] Catholic and God got a hold of him and
[1:18:17] pulled him
[1:18:19] out that's why brother Bram said he one
[1:18:21] of the
[1:18:23] greatest Church age Messengers one of
[1:18:25] the most re renowned because he started
[1:18:27] the Reformation he he started to re the
[1:18:30] Protestant to protest the Catholic
[1:18:33] Church everybody else during that 900
[1:18:34] years they were doing this yes papa Pope
[1:18:44] yeah they put 68 million Protestants to
[1:18:46] death from a time of St hippo Augustine
[1:18:48] of Hippo after St Augustine of Hippo
[1:18:50] until 1580 68 million Smuckers great
[1:18:54] reform if you want read it glorious
[1:18:55] reform it was now 68 million recorded on
[1:18:59] mology when one of their so-called
[1:19:01] Saints got the Revelation that anybody
[1:19:03] that disagreed with the Roman Church
[1:19:04] should die the heretic they just sent
[1:19:06] them around them boy he went to spill in
[1:19:08] the blood he jumped on his White Horse
[1:19:10] and on his red horse and he went riding
[1:19:13] oh now his great power comes he was made
[1:19:15] a viker of heaven and worshiped his God
[1:19:17] ruler of the Earth by uniting the church
[1:19:19] and state Together made him a ruler on
[1:19:21] Earth give him a crown over that he
[1:19:23] could prey the souls out of Pur
[1:19:24] Purgatory if you paid him enough he
[1:19:27] could also enter in other words
[1:19:29] intercede he was just like God on Earth
[1:19:30] instead of God together he had great
[1:19:33] power to kill whomever did not agree
[1:19:34] with his
[1:19:36] command who's going to say anything to
[1:19:38] him now listen that same spirit is right
[1:19:41] here today I hope not in this building
[1:19:45] but today that same Spirit brother Brown
[1:19:46] says you kill a man's influence you've
[1:19:48] killed the
[1:19:50] man so we got people going around
[1:19:52] killing the influence of of us
[1:19:56] Believers that's where that Spirit come
[1:19:59] from who's going to say anything to him
[1:20:02] the church can't say nothing he's head
[1:20:04] of IT State can't say nothing he's head
[1:20:06] of it so they died by the millions all
[1:20:09] them little churches brother was busted
[1:20:10] up and killed and murdered and fed the
[1:20:12] Lions and everything else see the dragon
[1:20:14] Rome gave him his seat and Authority the
[1:20:17] Bible said so so he rode his typed red
[1:20:19] horse through human blood till it
[1:20:23] became a red
[1:20:25] horse and here's what happened in that
[1:20:27] age Matthew 6: 211 let's stand our feet
[1:20:30] come on musicians we'll get to we'll get
[1:20:32] to the sard Ean Church age one of these
[1:20:33] days for where your treasure is there
[1:20:36] will your heart be
[1:20:38] also the Light of the body is the eye
[1:20:41] now listen we have two eyes
[1:20:43] right but we see
[1:20:45] single everybody with me we have two
[1:20:48] eyes but we see
[1:20:50] single if therefore thine eye be single
[1:20:53] thy whole body shall be full of light
[1:20:56] but if thine eye be
[1:20:58] evil thy whole body shall be full of
[1:21:01] Darkness if therefore the light that is
[1:21:04] in thee if if you if you carry inside of
[1:21:06] you something contrary to the word of
[1:21:09] God and I'm going to say in the message
[1:21:11] of the hour that light in you is
[1:21:16] darkness and God said what how great is
[1:21:18] that Darkness why because you're
[1:21:20] fooled as all those were fooled down
[1:21:22] Through the Ages listen Satan's a fooler
[1:21:24] fools people all the
[1:21:27] time he he can't be I mean he's a uh
[1:21:31] he's a master
[1:21:32] manipulator that's why brother R said
[1:21:34] we're no match for the
[1:21:36] devil but the Bible says resist the
[1:21:38] devil and they'll flee from you how
[1:21:41] powerful is that let's sing a song God
[1:21:43] bless you but think about these Church
[1:21:45] ages and about the seals now that's open
[1:21:47] showing what
[1:21:50] happened understand why I am so happy
[1:21:54] and
[1:21:55] [Music]
