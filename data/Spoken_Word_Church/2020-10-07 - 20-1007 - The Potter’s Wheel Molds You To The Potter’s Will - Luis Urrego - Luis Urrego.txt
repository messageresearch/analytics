holy holy holy yes holy holy holy you are holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord this evening i trust that you're happy to be in the house of god and and that you feel that hey man this is no place like home there's no place like home amen i i believe that where the word of god goes forth that's home to me amen where the the word of god is my home amen that's my home base if i don't know where to go i don't know what to do what where where how to turn next what decision to make next i just turn to the word amen i think the word has the answer to all of our questions in life some way or another maybe not directly but some way or another the answers are in there and the thing is that we have to do is we have to seek and we have to study yeah and that's the part that we don't like to do that's the part that oh that's boring but you're not gonna find if you don't seek you're not gonna you're not gonna you're not gonna proceed with your life with your christian life you're not going to move on with god if you don't do your part it's a simple thing yet it's so hard it's one of the two things that brother branham said that how do we grow as christians you know read your bible pray every day but yet it's the hardest two things for us to do because we don't want to do it we'd rather just go to sleep we'd rather just go do something else because that's the easiest thing but see that's what satan's trying to do you have to realize that they say your soul depends on it that's why your soul's worth ten thousand worlds yes sir it means it has unlimited value so feed your soul what it needs amen because the only thing that the word of god if you have the holy spirit in your life the only thing that you can feed off of and really feel satisfied is the word nothing else netflix won't do it instagram won't do it facebook boyfriends girlfriends they won't do it you know only the word of god and in reality i know that that's what you want because you really that's what you're thirsting for but you're seeking it in other things in other areas when in reality what you want is the word and until you realize that that's the word that where is that what you really want then the word can't help you but when you realize there's nothing else i can go to nothing else has satisfied me nothing else can satisfy me but this word then the word then can step in and help you i don't know who that was for but uh but i hope that you receive it amen praise god i came in here already shooting [Laughter] well greetings in the name of the lord i'm so glad to be in the house of god i'm glad that brother dale's doing better i appreciate god how how he's uh how he's still healing he's still doing wonderful things in this hour amen lots of people around the world praying for brother dale amen even people who don't even know him personally just all over the place so we just thank god for the saints praying thank you all for for praying for him amen so as you stand um we're going to go ahead and go to the word let's read in jeremiah chapter 18. i want to talk tonight a little bit about the potter and the clay amen i know we've heard many things about this in the past but maybe maybe we can say something here that that will help you amen and that will motivate you uh in this hour i think it i was going to go a certain direction and and and just the lord put this thought in my heart and i said well maybe i should go this way so amen so let's just bow our heads before we read our heavenly father we come before you lord once again we thank you father for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word lord we know father god that when them we find strength lord we find the answers to life lord jesus without you father god we can do nothing and lord you are the word father so we pray now that you would forgive us for our sins if there's any iniquity in our lives any wrong that we've done place it all under the blood of jesus christ father god for we cannot save ourselves lord but all salvation all healing comes from you father god and so lord we place ourselves before you lord anoint our ears and anoint our lips lord that we may say something that would help us to leave here edified and you glorified father for it's our desire lord jesus in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen praise god jeremiah chapter 18 verse 1 through 6 and then we're going to read in isaiah chapter 45 two verses there the bible says the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying arise and go down to the potter's house and there i will cause thee to hear my words then i went down to the potter's house and behold he rather work on the wheels so jeremiah better obeyed because that's what the lord told him to do and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter in other words there was a defect there was something wrong with it so get so look what happened so he made it made it made it again another vessel then choose another clay amen he made it again another vessel as seen good to the potter to make it then the word of the lord came to me saying house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potter's hands so are ye in mine hand o house of israel amen and we know that you and i are spiritual israel amen so uh we take this word as if he's speaking to us as well in isaiah chapter 45 verses 8 through 9 the bible says there drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it woe unto him that striveth with his maker oh my in other words woe unto you you who strives with your maker the one who made you let the paw pots heard strive with the pot's herds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioned that what maketh thou or thy work he hath no hands in other words can the clay say to the one that's making it this form in it what are you doing yeah what in the world are you doing and and they can't amen so you may be seated this evening amen let me if i give this a title i want to title it the potter's wheel molds you to the potter's will say that again the potter's wheel molds you to the potter's will amen amen and so and so we see here in jeremiah a very familiar verse uh that jeremiah was asked to go and see about the and see this potter amen and here he was working on a piece of clay that probably was not anything to begin with nothing just something that came from the from from the ground from the from the earth and he when he when jeremiah got in there he was already working on it on this piece of clay amen he was already doing a work on it so uh when that's what jeremiah sees when he goes in there amen so uh and of course we we just read there what what what happened but i want us to think about for for just a moment because sometimes we we ask the lord and we we say lord i want your will to be done in my life i want i want uh i want your perfect will to be done in my life and and sometimes we even often we we we recite the the bible verse where jesus the lord's prayer where he says thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven the thing is it's very dangerous to make that that prayer that's a very dangerous prayer to make because in reality if you do want god's will in your life you better get ready to get on his will if you really want god's will and your in your life and we know that god's will is his word if you really want to obey the word of god in your life and not do your own thing anymore then you better be prepared to get on god's will because that's where you're heading you see it's very important you want god's will oh i want the will of god in my life oh yes i do i want it with all my heart all right then there's going to be some tough times coming to you in your life in god's mind because god knows how sincere you are and and and sometimes when we're it seems like when we're doing the right thing then that's when things have start happening in our lives how many have felt that way how many have seen it to be that way is when you're doing the right thing and when you're trying to serve god when you're when everything seems to be crashing down upon you but god's fashioned it that way and god's made it that way because why he has an image and a purpose from the beginning amen of you and he knows exactly what you need in order to mold you into that image that he saw even before the foundation of the world amen and it's going to take lots of things amen to mold you into that image in that very image so you want his will you better be prepared to get on the potter's wheel you better get be prepared to be submitted to his word amen look what brother branham says in the message what is in that is that in your hand but the brand says that's the way the people today you don't like to get broke up you got to be broke up before you can be remade in other words you got to get out of your own self in order to be re uh reimaged into the image of god amen you know your image that can't can't be there anymore amen you have to take get out of your way you have to get self out of the way in order for you to get in god's way amen so you you don't we don't like to get broke up you know we don't like to we we don't like to get hurt we don't like to get marred we don't like to amen but that's what god uses in order for us to grow there's no better way amen i i don't find any other way to to to uh i mean even as you parents amen most of the time the best way to get the attention of the children is that you you punishment some way or another however you punish them usually it works maybe as they get older it doesn't work anymore but usually it works amen they listen and that's the same thing with god amen amen god knows how to deal exactly with you and knows exactly what he needs to do what buttons to push in order to mold you into his very image you got to be broke up before you can be remade the prophet went down to the potter's house to get broke up to get on the wheel and spun out something different if you're a sinner get on the wheel god will break you up mold you different shape your life up different what shape your home life different oh my your home life well we don't like it when people get in there but but but think about this saints you have to have your home life your home life in good condition if you want your home life to be in good condition to be led by god amen i've had people ask me i've had i've had parents tell me can you talk to my my son my my daughter uh you know she just doesn't listen or he doesn't listen and maybe you can give him a word of something that that you know might help them to stir them in the right direction and i'm thinking man you you need to get yourself your life straight you need you as the parent need to get straightened up first before i can say anything to your son or to your daughter and the one that was asking was was uh was was the mom and i said i said the home life the parents need to get right before you can be an example cause you want your whole you want your children to go and walk with god amen you must be walking with god you want your children to be faithful you better be faithful to god you want your your children to pray you want your children to you do that you do the praying and let them see that in your life amen praise god amen because it's very important we lead by examples we lead our children see what we do therefore they go amen and what we don't do they don't do amen but what we do usually they will follow amen jeremiah 18 so jeremiah 18 looking back here in jeremiah 18. we see that jeremiah goes in here and we don't see the full picture of what's going on we don't see all we know is that he goes in there and he sees a potter on and has a vessel on a wheel and he's molding it right right but uh uh but there's a whole process that goes in into shaping a vessel and brother wade you might have seen this i mean because you worked in a potter pottery uh there's a whole process that goes in it and there's a science that goes in it behind it and just kind of reading about it and looking into it there's so many things that you can type in the spiritual life amen amen yeah and so that's why even god uses the potter and the clay as him representing the potter and us as the clay amen because we're nothing saints we come into this world speaking lies we come into this world nothing and if you think that you're something in this hour let me tell you you're nothing even saying that amen you're showing that you're nothing when you think that you're something right and you watch amen those that think that they're haughty those those that that feel that they're uh unstoppable you wait until god gets a hold of you and you realize that you're not as unstoppable as you think you are amen amen praise god so jeremiah 18 goes in and and and we see here um the potter's the the the process of the potter amen and so i want to talk about that here for just a moment and and then maybe in just a little bit i might show i might show a video so i'm trying to go a little quick here but this right here is the is the potter's process the traditional way of how a potter makes makes a because i mean i know that and i know like i think kaylee and zoe they're doing pottery and there's probably they have they there's the way that they probably doing it now and i'm sure i don't know how you guys are not going out there digging mud outside outside or anything like that are you that's probably not what they're doing and you don't have like a like a brick oven that you're putting you know the pottery in or anything like that i doubt it things now are different now amen but so so and when i'm speaking about this right now i'm thinking about it in the way that they used to do it amen so always keep this in mind that the potter before he goes out there and starts he has an end goal in mind amen amen he has already a vision of of what he wants to do amen and that's the same thing with god in this hour even before the foundation of the world he knew you before the foundation of the world and he predestinated you amen amen see he knew all things amen but especially those of the uh his children he knew them amen because he knew that they were going to hear his own life amen look what jeremiah 29 11 says for i know the thoughts that are up that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to what to give you an expected end so everything that happens in your life amen is expected to happen in your life amen because god already foresaw it before the foundation of the world and that's something we can rest on saints amen ultimately as i've been speaking about uh you know uh regarding god you know we all have free moral agency and our life is shaped in the decisions that we make amen but god predestinated us amen amen and if you're to come to god amen god's going to make a way for you to come to him he's not going to leave you drive because because why his word is very important his thoughts are very important and he's not going to let those go amen he cares he cares more about his word than anything else and to fulfill that word and to fulfill it in your life amen praise god amen so so i i've always thought ever since i was young this this verse here jeremiah 29 11 has given me comfort for i know the thoughts that i think toward you seth who saith the lord amen thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end to god there's no surprises in your in your life there's nothing that happens in your life that god says oh my goodness i did not know that was going to take place in brother john's life on brother boyd's life what am i to do now he doesn't say that we say that that's right amen we say that and we get frustrated and we don't know what to do amen but god never says that and god wants us to realize that amen and the way we realize that is to just have peace and confidence in his word amen there's nothing better than that to give us peace than his word amen so when the potter goes out and he starts looking he has he has an image in mind of a vessel that he wants to create and so what he does is he goes out and he starts looking for the clay now i believe that there's specific clays that they're that there's that they're looking for well but let's say he goes out takes a shovel and starts digging in this area and starts taking it and putting it back near his his his house right or taking it in in his house or near his house because why it needs to be in the general and the near vicinity of where he's at amen it can't be further away it can't be a somewhere else amen it's got to be near the potter's house amen and sometimes he uses amen that shovel is to me it's like the the evangelist that comes through amen and he shovels and and and and and he's digging in there amen and and it's making us making us come out and making us jump making us amen but that is what god does amen in order to in order to bring us closer to his house amen closer to his house because he's not going to he's not going to call you shovel you out and then put you back where you where you were left amen no he's not going to do that that's not how his ministry works he pulls you out to take you closer to his house that's the reason why saints that when you come out of the world there's there has to be a difference when you say that you're justified amen that your sins have been forgiven you can't go back to those same sins obviously god is doing the work in our lives and and and and we we struggle we we have we have our faults and we're striving amen but in your heart you better not want to go back to those things amen if god is really the one who's pulling you out of that dirt out of that mire you see because sometimes i believe that that that you know we we go to meetings and this has happened i've seen it i've seen it out in the in the mission field you know in youth camps and things like that you see you see the young people or or people come up to the altar and you can see that they're really sincere and then a year later right you see them the the the the profession that they made and the sincerity and the crime that they did and then you don't see them there you see you and you notice and you see it because you see it on facebook usually that's where you see it something changed right the thing that they were there crying about is not there anymore in their life so we want to be and it's because they were not near they probably did not stay close into the potter's house amen for him to continue molding amen so look what isaiah uh so to me that potter he needs to go down and find a piece of clay and you know clay and mud is not clean you were not clean when god picked you out of the out of the out of the dirt out of the worldly dirt you were not clean i was not clean amen none of us were clean none of us are clean the bible says in isaiah 64 it says but we are all as unclean thing and all our unrighteousness are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon the name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou has hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities amen see god to god amen he hates sin he can't be around sin amen but now oh lord thou art our father verse 8 says we are the clay and thou are potter amen and we are all the work of thy hand amen praise god so each and every one of us come with a defect in our lives we all came to this life needing salvation amen we didn't come save we didn't come with anything in in us that was that was perfect a seed or nothing of that sort you had to receive the seed here amen and the seed is the word of god amen and so that is from when you receive that and then it starts working on to the outside amen so when god takes you up amen that's a form of justification amen see you god cleanse god you you just get you ask god to forgive you for your sins lord i've done wrong i'm a sinner i i know that i can't make it on my own because you cannot amen if god didn't make a way for you then there wouldn't be any way there wouldn't be any way praise god jesus said that it's the sick that need a doctor and not the ones that are well right hey man see the potter the butter he's not interested in stuffed shirts he's not interested in stuff those stuffed with religion he can't use them that kind of clay he can't use it's it's too it's too overstuffed it's got too much stuff in it amen but he wants to use one that he sees that there's some sort of form of pliability in there amen that's the kind of clay that he wants to use amen so the clay is shoveled out amen and and and it's placed into near the potter's house now the clay after that is prepared amen and uh this is what i call the the the sanctification process amen because after that the clay needs to be washed amen this clay that has been picked out from the ground that has been picked up from the earth now needs to be washed and it's washed with what gasoline it's washed with water amen with the water of the word is the only way that you're going to be washed in this hour that is how you're going to be sanctified amen that is how things are going to come off of your life as you hear the word in your life amen the word will be revealed to you as you open yourself to the word obviously if you don't open yourself to the word the word will not be revealed to you but when you open yourself to go to god and open yourself to the word and you say lord reveal your word unto me amen i'm gonna promise you you're not gonna fall asleep at church i'm gonna promise you that you won't you won't think that church services are boring amen amen i'ma promise you that you're gonna enjoy the word of god praise god because why you want the word to wash you amen so as this clay amen is here the potter takes this clay and puts it in a reservoir amen and in this reservoir he's there cleaning it he's there washing it amen and then he takes this clay and he puts it up in another in another reservoir so that the clay can uh uh um what's the word i i used here it can start it can start to it starts leaving lumps and sticks and things left left behind stones and things that they had in it amen it starts filtering that's right it starts being filtered and it's and it's left there see but it had to start with the word it has to start with the water amen it has to start with the going to church amen it has to start with reading your own bible amen praise god it has to start that way amen amen i remember when i came to the lord amen when i was 12 years old and and i first heard about salvation and and i came to the lord jesus i accepted him i said lord i'm i'm a sinner i repent and and and the first thing that that i wanted to do was get in the word of god amen i didn't understand anything i didn't understand only that jesus christ died for my sins but in the process of getting in the word i started to understand more and more about the word and the and people say i don't understand the word but you're not going to understand it when you don't get in it you just you if you don't get in the word on your own amen you have to get in the word amen you have to let that word wash praise god so this clay is washed with water and it's stirred amen until it becomes this mush amen and and then and and and this bush is then placed in these settling tanks where all these sticks and stones and lumps are left behind amen and so that's the process of sanctifications where it starts amen and the clay has left their setting sometimes for about six months for about six months it's sitting there just being sanctified and you're and maybe in those six months and you know you're what you're hoping you're man when am i gonna get to start preaching when am i going to get started playing the piano at church when am i going to start doing this then the other and god says you're not ready yet you're not ready you're still in the process of being sanctified amen how many how many preachers have have come to to preach the word amen to that that they feel that desire to preach the gospel they preach the word amen and when they and they start amen because they weren't truly called and they make a big mess out of it amen amen see it has to be something that has to be proved and tried amen your life has to be has to be in a certain point a certain check amen before god can put you because remember you're not even on the potter's wheel not yet you're not even on the potter's wheel yet the funda hasn't even really started yet amen praise god so you're left there for six months amen this what this does it helps to make the clay more pliable [Music] it's put in the shell for six months so that you can become more pliable so that you are are you willing to come to church when you're supposed to come to church are you willing to read the word when you when you should read the word are you willing to listen to the message just doing the simple things can you do those simple things before you say you come over here and you have a gift to call a call to preach amen that's right we're called to do something in church or something like that right can you even do the simple things that's what those six months are for them just types but very interesting amen and now after these six months the potter then he grabs a mallet he takes the he takes the clay and he start and he puts is get ready to start working on it and he takes a mallet and starts beating around it amen and this is for this is the re this is to take all the air bubbles out of the clay amen take all air bubbles out of the clay now see you think oh my i've been good lord all these six months i've been waiting on you i've been praying i've been going to church i've been then he takes you oh yes lord oh i feel an anointing i feel something you're doing something in my life and here he comes with the spiritual mallet yeah and something happens in your life something that you're weird you're not you're not you're not expecting but god knew before the foundation of the world because you still have spiritual air bubbles in your life that need to be taken out remember you still not yet placed on the wheel he's just beating that thing getting it ready because he wants to put it on the wheel the thing is is that and the clay can't say anything no no no i don't want that mallard on me no you want me to shape you right let me continue beating and all air bubbles have to be out praise god amen praise god and you know saints as i said earlier you know oftentimes it's when we think that we're doing the right thing and when we're we're serving the lord it's when god says all right it looks like they're ready for a trial looks like they're ready for something in their life amen because i know what they need in order for them to to move on praise god he's not going to kill us he knows that he's not going to kill us we think that he is by the things that happen in our lives we think that he's trying to kill us but he's not going to kill us all he is is he's using that tool which is satan he's using that tool to shape and thick things out of our lives brother branham said that say all satan is is just the tool in god's hand that's all he is you say satan is after me oh my but you don't you don't understand god allows satan to be after you to take those spiritual air bubbles out of your life you still have a little bit of you in there that needs to be taken out and you know why those air bubbles need to be taken out from the clay because if you if you don't have air bubbles out amen see i used to i when i worked at papa john's pizza and i and i and i and i used to work with the dough and started work you know before we before we even started doing the spinning and all that kind of stuff and i would tell you that was fun spinning that doe and doing tricks and stuff like that that was fun man we gave a show on friday nights there to the customers and it was it was fun back in the day i don't even know if they do that now but but before you even get to even work with the mold and start putting toppings on the pizza you have to make sure that there's no air bubbles on the dough you see make sure they're all air bubbles out because eventually when the those air bubbles and the pizza that are in that dough get in the oven and it's going to cause a mess there's going to burst it's going to crack that's why you when sometimes when you get your pizza and there's like a big old hole up and around the crust the air bubble wasn't completely taken out you see and i would have gotten in trouble if a pizza came out like that in papa john's so so this is what happens amen with this clay all air bubbles have to be taken out amen now the clay then is finally placed on the wheel amen how many are still with me amen you need to stand up okay i'll make you stand up amen praise god praise god so the clay is finally going to be placed on the wheel now if you've seen a traditional wheel uh uh the way there's a big old wheel down at the bottom and then there's a there's a shaft up in the middle and then is a it's attached to another wheel at the top i don't know if that's the kind of wheels that you and you you girls are doing but that's the original way the weight is that is that correct and so and so the potter he uses his feet to turn the wheel at the bottom all right and as he's turning that wheel at the bottom it's causing the wheel at the top to move as well and i think it's moving the other way if i'm not mistaken see here look at me so clockwise okay so as so he's turning that wheel amen and it's causing that upper wheel to move and so on the upper wheel that's where he pose he puts the piece of clay i mean i think of these wheels and just looking at this i'm thinking you know what there's the word of god amen and it's connected to the message amen and as the word of god is turning the message has to be turning as well amen they don't contradict each other you see the message in the bible they they they don't contradict they are saying the exact same thing it it's it's the people that make it seem like it's it's contrary amen it's the people that think that there is something contrary or there is something wrong with the word of god but in reality it's them amen or that something is wrong with the message but in reality it's them amen amen see that's the reason why we need revelation in our lives we need spiritual revelation in our lives to put these things together because yes it's very it's very uh a lot of things that brother branham said amen that's the reason why you have to study and read the word amen and come to church listen to the word and it helps us god the holy spirit will help us to put two and two together amen to make sense of the message which is tied to the word amen praise god so there there are these two stones amen the word and the message both working together in order to mold you amen and so finally the clay is placed on that upper wheel amen and that clay and the potter starts spinning that that that wheel at the top and so the clay starts going amen and it just seems like that that you're that as it's going it looks like the clay is out of control like it like it's like it's going out of control but you see that's at that's at that point amen that that that the the potter he starts taking his hands and starts working on it as he's spinning it amen he's got complete control of it see in your life it might seem like it's completely out of control but in reality let me tell you what if you're still alive if you're still breathing in this hour if you woke up this morning god's got control of your life god's got mercy on your life god's got grace on your life amen if you are still here right living and breathing in this hour so that means his hands are on you his hands are still on you even though it seems like the thing is going and i don't know where i'm going oh god help me but god is in full control his hands are on you amen rest assured that his hands aren't on you the whole time it may not feel like it but he's got his hands on you this is like the song goes he's got the whole world in his hands praise god amen so now i want to get into something here for just a moment and and i'll show you here uh uh a a video here in just a moment no so of what happens when the clay starts spinning so he starts using his hands amen starts using his hands amen how many fingers do we have in our hands amen five he starts taking in and spinning it's the it's the word and the message together and your life is spinning all you know you're going to church you're doing everything that you're supposed to do god's doing a work in your life you're going to school you're going to work things are happening in your life you have to pay car insurance you have to do all these different things you know your life is turning amen and god is putting everything all the pieces together everything together he's molding you amen and here comes his he's got his whole five hands all ten hands oh ten fingers on you amen each each hand has five fingers amen and so to me i i typed that as the five-fold ministry amen the five-fold ministry amen every time you come and hear the word of god you're hearing it through the five-fold ministry amen and the faithful ministry is there what to perfect isn't what the the word of god says amen amen again and i say it's not the faithful ministry but it's the holy spirit amen through the faithful ministry that should be connecting to the same holy spirit that you have amen should be the same holy spirit we're just we're not the ones who just have the holy spirit you have to have that same spirit in your life because there's times when the whole when the fivefold ministry is not around what are you gonna do amen you've got god and you've got that word that he's given you amen praise god and he said he will lead you and guide you unto all truth amen each finger has a specific purpose in helping shape the clay amen and you cannot discount neither one right you can't discount neither one of those one i mean you can't say i don't need the teacher and i don't need the evangelist i don't need amen you need all of them in order to grow amen in order to grow you need all of the faithful ministry now some of some of the five-fold one of them is going to speak to you more then then another one amen in order for you to grow amen for you to be molded amen but you need each and every one of them amen absolutely need each one of them so there's the potter's hands they're all over that that vessel that piece of clay and you know what the potter is doing hey man he's using upward pressure he's using upward pressure in order to shape the clay isn't that what you do zoe kaylie using upward pressure amen in order to to to get the the the shape of the clay amen and you know what god is doing he's trying to enlarge he's trying to make the capacity of that vessel larger as he's doing that amen he's trying to get the capacity of it he wants to make it he wants to make it nice and round and nice and where a lot of god can fit in there amen but he's using lots of upward pressure and it might hurt it might hurt yeah it doesn't feel good yeah you know sometimes my my wife massages me and on my back and and i'm almost like man i don't want a massage from you it hurts well she and and she loves it when i do it i'm just there pow pow and she thinks it's the greatest thing in the world i i i to me it hurts i like those those those nights where where like you know just those swedish massages you know when you're getting that deep tissue thing oh man that really really hurts but you see that's what the the potter is doing to this clay doing that deep tissue massage you know getting all in there amen but because it's made and it's forming something you're going to see in a video here in just a moment if you've never seen the process it's really it's really neat it's really neat so god god is trying to enlarge our capacity and and you know what saints without this pressure they're not this will will not be accomplished you will not have that capacity of to have more of god without the pressure in your life see whoever told you that that the christian life was going to be a be a flower bed of ease they they lied to you that you're that it's simple to serve god it's difficult amen but as i always say it's worth it it's always worth it amen because who else can we turn to he's the one who has the words of eternal life amen you don't find the words of eternal life in in the in the in the world in the music of the world you don't find the words of eternal life and billy eilish or anything of that amen you find the words of eternal life in the word of god amen second corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 says for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day listen to this for our light affliction which is but for a moment you see the things that we go through the struggles and the problems that we go through in our life there for a moment see to god a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a day so it's big for us but it's not big for him amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory luke 21 verse 27 says and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh when you start seeing that pressure in your life and things in your life and you know that you're walking with god and amen this is where you need to be looking up right because your redemption is drawing now if you're suffering in your life and even paul says this if you're suffering in your life for things that you are doing that are wrong that's the consequences of your own foolishness you need to suffer those things but if you're suffering for doing right amen not for one those things are molding you molding your character and two is telling you hey you're doing the right thing you're in the right way amen praise god so i if things are going very smooth in your life you better be thinking lord what am i what am i doing wrong what am i doing wrong lord show me and sometimes when we think we got everything all in order and everything like that all of a sudden that transmission blows out in your car the water heater starts leaking in in your basement the roof all of a sudden god sends hurricane after hurricane or allows hurricane after hurricane to just fly right over your roof and leaks start going right through your roof oh my goodness believe me it's happened i don't know what it's like when you think everything is just fine and dandy amen that's when you need to worry amen amen so now there's a there's a transition here that i want to talk about here for just a moment there's a transition as the clay is spinning again we're going to watch this here in just a moment well actually i'm going to ask brother joe can you go ahead and cue that up or brother anderson but this transition here and just pause it here for just a moment but in this transition right here as the clay is spinning see he's working on it on the outside right as it's spinning and then all of a sudden he starts to take it and starts to work in the middle of it i mean just just i it's still spinning the whole thing is spinning but then there's a transition where he starts working in it in the middle and that's where the process of it where he starts working of it on it in the heart amen in the heart now i'm going to show this video here real quick brother brother joe we could play and i think they have volume to it there are four basic steps in throwing a pot on the potter's wheel each of them shows something about us and god step one balance the clay the technique is called centering the whole purpose of this step is to bring the clay to the point of workability if the piece loses its balance often the potter must begin again the potter's hands are both placed on the clay his left arm is firmly wedged against his body and his left hand is against the closest part of the spinning clay his right hand is on the far side clay the clay flows between his hands now the grip becomes firmer and the right hand moves toward the left as the clay responds his hands move up or down as needed the clay fights back suddenly the struggle is over and the ball of clay is balanced god as the potter is seeking balance in your life he wants to center you you will be at rest when does god stop the sintering process when the struggle ceases when you rest in the potter's hand step two the clay is opened in order to open the clay the potter must find the center of the clay he does this by first taking just a few dribbles of water and letting it flow over the clay then he places both hands on the sides of the clay with his thumbs gently riding on the upper surface and then as the clay is spun his thumbs again very gently ride the surface of the clay to the center of the spin as he reaches the center his thumbs stiffen and carefully push downward a small indentation is now at the very center of the clay leaving one hand to remain along the side of the clay the potter takes his other hand and places his forefingers in the indentation and pushes down the goal is not to dig the clay out but to move the clay the clay if it has been centered correctly opens creating thick walls between his thumb and the remaining fingers the lump of clay is now a vessel the change has begun the potter then rechecks it for balance now he is ready to move to create a strong base he takes one of his sponges and cleans out the interior of the spinning clay to be open before the lord means that you are now willing to be controlled you are open as his vessel step three the clay is lifted up once the clay is opened the potter quickly moves to lift the clay into a tall cylinder this is the beginning of the fragile stages of the pot's formation the clay is fragile because during the lifting of the clay the walls are thinned as the potter pushes upward the clay begins to rise both hands cause and follow this movement like a wave moving toward the shore the clay moves upward growing always rising the aim of the potter is not to force the clay but to grow the moving clay towards a single point when the inside of the cylinder is growing correctly the outside takes care of itself remember peter's words so be humble under god's powerful hand then he will lift you up when the right turn comes first peter 5 6 god by his mercy over your life has caused your heart to be open to his plan now release yourself to be lifted up he will focus on the inside of you and then he will present you ready to be shaped for your final calling step 4 shaping the clay the tall cylinder spins before the potter it is ready to be shaped the shaping of the clay is where the art of the artist is truly seen it is the time when the potter slows the wheel down and spins very specific detailed time with the clay in fact the clay stands very fragile in the potter's hands the slightest wrong movement from the potter will result in a full collapse of the pot his eyes never leave the clay slowly very slowly the clay takes the shape the potter has in mind each stroke in shaping is small sometimes when the potter looks into the pot the water in the base reflects his face the potter sees himself as the clay is shaped now instead of a cylinder there is a foot a base a body a neck a mouth a lip each part is important to the final plan each part is shaped exactly according to the vessel's purpose when he has finished the wheel becomes a quiet platform where the potter looks at his art he smiles you are at some stage with god as potter of your life remember paul's word we all show the lord's glory and we are being changed to be like him second corinthians 3 18. amen praise god hope you enjoyed that amen now i wanted to i wanted to take that a moment to just talk about the part where he where he starts that that the hole in the middle and you notice that that that potter he takes water and puts it in that in that hole that he creates now see there's a transition in your life from sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen you see and the baptism amen that's the actual it's a feeling amen in your life now he didn't feel the whole pot because obviously he wasn't fully formed eventually when the pot is done it will be filled it will be completely amen to the fullness amen that he envisioned before the foundation of the world but see he he just partially feels it and in in him feeling it it makes the heart open more that hole opened more so that now his whole hand can fit in there you see so it's god amen god wants to do a complete work in your life in the feeling and the baptism of the holy ghost amen it's it's it's god he wants to fully take take charge of your life amen praise god so i thought that was very interesting and the rest of the video of course of course is good amen but you notice that the potter just doesn't work on the outside amen he has to work on the inside as well amen and you see sometimes we want to change our life on the outside only just we want to be sure that we're good on the outside amen but in reality the inside is full of dead man's bones it's full of nonsense and it's full of the world amen god wants to take care of that inside as a matter of fact when he works on the inside then the outside can look even more beautiful amen but when you try to do the things amen to look good on the outside only amen eventually uh that won't go too long that will fail all those things will fail you can look like a christian and you can act like one talk like one eventually you'll show who you really are you show you really are amen so the inside is just as important as the outside because wow that is where the feeling takes place amen that's where that's where the feeling takes place is everybody okay praise god amen the inside of the vessel as i said earlier it's called the heart amen so the potter puts some of that water in there amen filling of the holy ghost to continue working on it from the inside look what ephesians chapter 1 says that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom you also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also that ye believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise amen see is that water go that water going in there that allows god amen to continue molding you from the inside you see now that's not the a bunch of water it's not all of the water it's just a portion but yet it's water that is the word i hope you understand what i'm trying to get to with that amen which is verse 14 says which is the earnest of our inheritance see this the baptism of the holy ghost amen in your life the feeling of the holy spirit is the earnest or in other words it's the down payment of what's coming to you ahead you see yes sir it's the down payment of the purchase that he's made amen which is the earnest of iron hedge until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen so after the potter has truly worked on the inside then he can start shaping more details on the outside as you as you just saw you see as he starts fully working and you know he he had almost his whole arm in there at one point you see pulling that pressure because he's got to do the pressure from the inside not just on the outside but inside as well amen i hope in your mind you're spiritualizing all of this and hopefully you you've experienced these things in your life amen because if you're really serving god amen let me tell you what saints we're heading to things amen and we're experiencing things right now where things are uncertain i believe god is molding us amen i believe god has us on that wheel amen and it's our duty amen to just have trust in him confidence that he knows what he's doing amen amen so and then at the end there he starts forming what's what's called the mouth and the lip you notice there at the at the end he there was the the mouth which is the entrance of the to the water to the vessel and then the lip around it or the little lip where the where water can come out from you see and uh so after the potter has shaped and molded the vessel both inwardly and naturally he must finish with the topmost part which is called the mouth the mouth is vital it is the final part that anything inside the vessel touches when it is poured out the mouth affects and influences everything that comes out of the heart that's why jesus said a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good amen when he has good treasure in his heart when the holy spirit is in his heart he good things will come out amen and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh amen amen out of what you feed off of amen that's what you're going to speak right out of what out of out of the things that you that you watch and the things that you listen to and the things that that you feed off of spiritually that's what you're going to speak amen i don't know i mean this is all elementary to us but yet we failed we failed so many times that the basic things of christianity amen amen because saints god has to get us in speaking conditions this is the hour you notice how that god is shaping the statue of a perfect man amen from the feet to the head you see and the head amen where's the mouth it's around the head the intelligence you see he's the intelligence so we got to be speaking what he says we got to get to speaking conditions amen to speak the word of god because i'm going to tell you what when you need that can of beans and it's and you don't have the can of beans laying around amen what are you going to do then you see i hope we don't have to go through things like that but there brother brown talked about a squeeze coming on the bride and we might be feeling those things already we might we started might already started feeling these things i don't think this is the squeeze that brother brown talked about no because i still see people going to the restaurants going to walmart going i'm in lowe's and building buying getting married going to school doing it everything is normal the only difference is they got a mask on that's about it and they're kind of scared of one another now but that that that's it let me tell you what something's coming down amen if you're not pressurized by the potter amen if you haven't been pressurized by his word amen if you have been pressurized in that holy spirit amen amen you might fail that test but take these times these moments that we have to come to church amen to prepare us for those times amen don't take him for granted amen sometimes the vessel gets marred amen and as we read there in jeremiah amen that what happened the the vessel uh gets marred but what happened the potter all he does is brings it back down squeezes it back down but this unused doesn't use another piece of clay doesn't go out and start the process again to go out to the riverbed and and bring it forth and and and and and step on it and do everything no he just takes the same clay and starts molding it again so if you don't pass the test the first time you're gonna pass it the second time you don't pass it the second time you're gonna pass it the third time and so on forth and so forth until you pass the test until he sees amen his reflection amen just like i like what they said there that the potter sees his reflection down at the base because they're of the water that's in there amen amen amen praise god can you imagine imagine when that when that vessel's fully full of water amen that that that that that image was going to be even closer it's going to be right there amen praise god amen and sometimes that clay gets marred and some and some sometimes it gets uh uh uh some some uh uh something wrong with it but it's not the fault it's usually not the fault of the potter it's something with the clay itself and the and the potter god has to go in there and figure out what it is amen then he can reshape it again amen he has to bring you down low and to reshape you because he wants to make sure that you pass that test james chapter 1 it says my brethren verse 2 my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience amen they're trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing wanting nothing amen first peter 5 says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that you may that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you so sometimes just because he he brings us back down and something amen and you're wondering lord what is it that you're doing in my life i'm back here it seems like i'm in step one again but god you just know that god amen he cares about you amen and he has total control he's not giving up on you hey we we give up on ourselves amen and you give up and you say oh you know my my children they're not coming to god amen they're still living they're still breathing that means there's still mercy for them and that means there's still hope for them amen praise god amen and finally after the potter has taken this pot and has formed this vessel into what he has envisioned amen it's still not not ready amen because above it still needs to be placed in the oven amen it still needs to be placed in the fiery furnace amen amen praise god one of the last things that we may have to face is death amen or a squeeze amen and what are you going to do then is it time to crack then is it time to give up on god then amen praise god but see god has already prepared us beforehand right in the molding on the wheel in order for us to get to get us ready for the for the for the fire amen that last trial for us is sometimes we may need to face death you see we don't we're not promised tomorrow amen we know that who conquered death and that that conqueror is in us amen if we're we're to we're to not die and man we're not going to die amen but god has a has an appointment for each and every one of us first peter chapter 4 says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you in other words don't think it's strange amen it's something to be expected amen in order to harden the vessel why do you put something through fire in order to make it hard amen as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed i like that that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy amen and after he goes through that oven after he goes through that process of he being heated up then the potter can take it and say this is exactly the vision that i had from the beginning when i was down there in that river on that riverbed this is exactly what i was imagining and the vision that god has for you amen is the vision that he had before before the foundation of the world praise god brother branham says here i'm moving a little quickly that says now look now remember there'll be an impersonation of that because it i'm sorry now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that he's speaking of the third pool because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and i have i am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can be can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power amen amen what you've seen temporarily what we've we've all seen great things happening in our lives i mean there's been great miracles that have taken place even in this in this church i believe even brother dale's is a great miracle amen every healing that takes place amen is a miracle from god man god healed you from a cold that's a miracle amen god healed your your your toothache amen that's a miracle amen god god your nail grew back out that's a miracle because that all that all that is cells and all life comes from god so it's a miracle we've seen great things happen in in in our lives amen but what a greater thing amen we're going to see greater things but at some at a point in time at a junction of time amen but there has to be a squeeze to squeeze us down amen in order for everything that god has placed in us to be fully fully uh fully displayed amen amen and it's when we come out of the oven it's at this point that we are transformed into the image that the potter had of us from the beginning right in first corinthians 15 it says but we shall all be changed amen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen this corruption must take on incorruption amen and this mortal must take on immortality and it's at this point that your vessel is completely filled for good both and inside and outside amen i like something that brother dale said a long time ago and i i believe it he said that it's at that point amen that you will be able to fully say that you're born again amen see right now we say you're born again but you know again remember we have the holy spirit amen partially amen we have the the the down payment of it amen but it's at that point when you fully come amen through that process of fully amen you've conquered death hell and the grave amen you come out on the other side amen exactly what he envisioned of you before the foundation of the world that full eden condition amen and even even in a greater way because adam didn't even have eternal life in his flesh you'd have eternal life in your flesh amen eternal life not just in your soul but in your flesh manifested on the outside that is the full new birth process ava you know what that's when we actually begin to live amen that's when we actually begin to live and i believe we will be learning even more of god at that point amen don't think that that when we get to that point that that's it that's all of god we need to know no i believe god is going to be revealing himself even more at that point amen oh man we can't put no limit on god amen so you want to get on the potter's wheel amen that that but then you we want to make sure that we want to be in his will then and ready to receive amen whatever comes our way amen and don't think it's strange if it comes and just say lord stop say lord you're doing something in my life amen and i believe god is doing something in our lives let's stand to our feet we're gonna have the musicians come
