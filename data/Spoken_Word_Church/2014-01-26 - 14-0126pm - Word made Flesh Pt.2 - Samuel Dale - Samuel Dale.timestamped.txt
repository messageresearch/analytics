[12:32] guide us in Jesus name Amen okay John 1
[12:38] 1 through 14 in the beginning was the
[12:42] word and the Word was with God and the
[12:44] Word was God
[12:45] the same was in the beginning with God
[12:47] all things were made by him and without
[12:49] him was not anything made that was made
[12:51] in him was life and the life was the
[12:54] light of men and light shyness and
[12:56] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[12:57] it not the words that couldn't stop it
[13:02] it's not comprehended if they there
[13:05] there's no way they can the world can
[13:06] comprehend but it can try to hinder you
[13:09] know in doing and it's tried it's best
[13:12] but he can't do it since there was a man
[13:14] sent from God whose name was John the
[13:16] same came for a witness to bear witness
[13:19] of the light that all men through him
[13:21] might be believed he was not that light
[13:23] but was sent of our witness of that
[13:26] light that was the true light which
[13:28] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[13:30] world he was in the world and the world
[13:32] was made by him in the world knew him
[13:34] not he came into his own and his own
[13:37] received him not but as many as received
[13:40] him to them gave he power to become the
[13:43] sons of God even to them that believe on
[13:47] his name which was born not of the which
[13:50] were born not of blood nor the will of
[13:52] the flesh nor the will of man but of God
[13:55] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[13:58] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[14:01] the only begotten of the Father full of
[14:03] grace and truth
[14:07] 1st John 1 that which front was from the
[14:12] beginning which we have heard which we
[14:14] have seen with our eyes which we have
[14:17] looked upon and our hands have handled
[14:19] of the word of life for the life was
[14:22] manifested in with seen it and bear
[14:24] witness and show unto you that eternal
[14:27] life which was with the father and was
[14:29] manifested unto us that which we have
[14:32] seen and heard declare we unto you that
[14:34] ye also may have fellowship with us and
[14:37] truly our Fellowship is with the father
[14:39] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[14:42] things right we
[14:44] to you that your joy may be full and
[14:47] we're to the end time is where we're
[14:49] coming down especially right this this
[14:54] then is the message now what's the
[14:56] message which we have heard of him and
[15:00] declare unto you that God is light and
[15:03] in him is no darkness at all if we say
[15:06] that we have fellowship with him and
[15:08] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[15:10] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[15:13] is in the light we have fellowship one
[15:14] with another and the blood of Jesus
[15:17] Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin
[15:20] you may be seated the Lord that is
[15:23] blessing to the reading of the word now
[15:26] not to back up too much but to tie
[15:28] together this morning to where we can
[15:31] try to move on in the message and doings
[15:37] brother Aaron could you come up and
[15:40] click at least to our home because some
[15:42] are going this away someone going this
[15:44] away
[15:46] just click the click it where the arrow
[15:48] run it metal air-conditioner will take
[15:50] care of itself
[15:51] all right now we were talking about what
[15:56] the word made flesh
[16:00] now we're reading a little bit that the
[16:03] prophet says the word made flesh is the
[16:06] light of the age it's done clicked on
[16:09] itself now Aaron so I guess it took care
[16:11] of its own self it heard me but see the
[16:20] word made flesh you say yeah but that
[16:22] was Jesus Christ well I know that we
[16:27] know the scripture and what it's saying
[16:29] but think about that there's a word for
[16:34] each age and there's somebody to make
[16:40] that word manifest all right then if we
[16:45] believe what Moses was there
[16:46] he made it manifest David was dark he
[16:49] made it manifest Joshua was there
[16:51] he made it manifest etc etc coming
[16:53] through and then we come down through
[16:55] the ages and this is what I'm
[16:57] talking about we come through the ages
[17:01] in each age had a word to be made
[17:06] manifest are revealed to that age well
[17:10] then somebody will have to be there you
[17:12] know or has been there to make that
[17:17] manifest you know and that was the Bible
[17:21] being written that we were speaking of
[17:23] this morning as the Bible being the Word
[17:26] of God it being the revelation of Jesus
[17:28] Christ
[17:28] but in that revelation of Jesus Christ
[17:31] it is showing not just the point of
[17:35] Jesus Christ in one God and water
[17:38] baptism and things like that it's
[17:42] showing also that there are is a people
[17:46] or have been a people and I believe is
[17:49] the people now to make manifest the word
[17:52] or the hour then when we leave here
[17:55] there will be a redemption for the Jews
[17:57] that will be up to them for their word
[18:01] and their day they're not in this day
[18:02] they're not trying to manifest him as
[18:05] you know we are they're not trying to
[18:08] talk about a rapture their interest is
[18:12] their homeland and and you know what
[18:15] future they could receive from that but
[18:19] see that's that's a word that would be
[18:21] made manifest all right we were talking
[18:24] about in the prophets said there have to
[18:25] be somebody to make that manifest all
[18:30] right it has been spoken right now see
[18:35] then don't forget and we will go in the
[18:38] Lord willing next Sunday we will be
[18:40] trying to talk about more like the the
[18:43] ages and how that things turn out to be
[18:47] a carrier and all but then coming out to
[18:51] the full word because we believe that
[18:54] Jesus crisis was covered in this morning
[18:56] he was the word in full well and he was
[19:01] the fullness of the Godhead bodily and
[19:03] he was God made manifest in human flesh
[19:06] are the word made flesh
[19:11] or why can't we believe then that as
[19:14] seeing the ages the time the people that
[19:17] that was God made manifest for the time
[19:23] they the word forever age their a seed
[19:26] remember it's not the person that comes
[19:29] free destinated eternally 154 Church age
[19:32] book but it's to see their word alright
[19:35] the rest comes by for knowledge in the
[19:38] basis that that for knowledge allows him
[19:41] to know where that seed will land and
[19:44] who would be what what see then when
[19:48] Martin Luther we try to connect the end
[19:50] of those type of things when he began
[19:52] with a just shall live by faith that was
[19:55] the word of that age he was not
[19:57] responsible for the seals the things
[20:00] that you and I understand that was not
[20:03] the age he was living in he was living
[20:06] in the age of the manifestation of the
[20:09] word of God to counteract the teachings
[20:13] of the Catholic Church and the things
[20:16] that had brought it into a total works
[20:18] and paying your way and in doing all the
[20:22] things and as long as you could pay God
[20:25] forgive but if you couldn't pay he
[20:27] didn't forgive mostly then that would
[20:30] not be in any basis it that we poor
[20:32] folks could handle you know and it would
[20:35] make very poor and it has around the
[20:37] world made nations very poor you
[20:40] remember the Prophet saying communism
[20:44] the reason it rose in Russia was what
[20:47] because of the Catholic Church bleeding
[20:49] the people for the money no what's the
[20:55] church the word has got to be made alive
[21:00] and it has been now get my point and
[21:04] let's move on there would be no one
[21:08] should be argue that the word has been
[21:10] made manifest by somebody in every age
[21:13] all right so like I said you got Luther
[21:16] with a just shall live by faith
[21:17] he made that manifest then you got
[21:22] Wesley coming along with sanctification
[21:25] he made that manifest it might have been
[21:28] into a form of works in some ways but
[21:33] still it was the word of the hour
[21:36] it was the seed of the hour that was
[21:41] predestinated they are you listening to
[21:49] come to pies because it's the seed our
[21:52] word that's predestinated eternally so
[21:56] there is no way to get out of what you
[22:00] know other than look back and say thank
[22:03] you Lord for fulfilling your word right
[22:05] see then when Azusa Street came 1906 he
[22:12] that was a manifestation of God that's
[22:18] what gets me then when I hear people you
[22:19] know people know big names and think oh
[22:23] the Pentecostal false well you think
[22:28] he'd listen to me quote and brother
[22:30] branham tell him what it was now you
[22:31] didn't listen to me
[22:32] he went right on don't you come right
[22:34] here that night and said it again you
[22:37] know that Pentecost was false there was
[22:41] a false part of Pentecost yes but
[22:44] Pentecost wouldn't Fox Luke that
[22:47] wouldn't false
[22:47] Wesley wouldn't false it was the light
[22:50] of the age the badness wouldn't fall
[22:52] false the Methodists the Presbyterian
[22:55] they all had word coming forth see for
[23:01] the age that they were living well but
[23:05] then we look at it and say well well we
[23:07] don't see too much and that's a favorite
[23:12] thing today because the way the devil
[23:14] has of attacking us well we don't see
[23:17] much going on you talk about us being
[23:19] the word well who's gonna do it it's in
[23:29] the Bible
[23:32] you know what you'd be if you live back
[23:34] in Luther's day don't believe nothing go
[23:36] no he just fanatic he just got it all a
[23:40] little idea you try to draw a following
[23:45] and that's what they thought about
[23:47] brother Branham when the message came
[23:49] what you see think about it if we were a
[23:58] part of God before the foundation of the
[24:00] world has the eternal life that we have
[24:02] within us and I believe that's the only
[24:04] part that was dark then by having
[24:09] eternal life makes me part of God and we
[24:12] were quoting this morning where brother
[24:14] Branham said it he said that God is not
[24:20] complete without you why because he
[24:25] chose it that away
[24:29] sister seed coming down that God
[24:32] predestinated eternally people are
[24:36] predestinated by foreknowledge do you
[24:40] see why I could have stayed a long time
[24:42] back there on that people come
[24:44] predestinated by foreknowledge the world
[24:47] and the things you and I are the same
[24:49] way before knowledge but that word our
[24:53] seed he was going to see it done will
[24:57] get next week the Lord willing to jaw or
[25:00] he said I will restore God promised it
[25:05] well why can't we just believe that
[25:07] we're part of it why can't we accept it
[25:11] it's being that it's easy to look back
[25:14] and see what somebody else was then look
[25:19] forward in a hopes of somebody and maybe
[25:24] being able to attain well now in the
[25:32] days of Luther when he brought the
[25:36] message there was a lot of people
[25:39] rebelled against that and a lot of
[25:40] people believed it right but still he
[25:45] he didn't care why because God had spoke
[25:50] to him what about a Moses of the word of
[25:55] his hour when that when he was dire in
[25:59] Egypt he was next to Pharaoh wouldn't he
[26:05] he led two armies he was in charge all
[26:10] he had to do would just take over when
[26:14] he suffered the reproach of Christ
[26:16] counting it greater riches to go through
[26:21] all that he went through yes for Christ
[26:24] and that was a man without the new birth
[26:29] why would we have trouble bleeding who
[26:32] we are now if we got you know we are in
[26:40] the day of birth certificates etc etc
[26:44] you know to prove who we are but you
[26:49] know right now the greatest proof you
[26:53] have of who you are you know what it is
[26:58] they might do what is it
[27:05] no that's mr. partner and I'm done about
[27:08] in the natural do you know the greatest
[27:13] thing to prove who you are is your
[27:15] telephone number everywhere you go they
[27:21] got to have it birth certificates are so
[27:26] much counterfeited driver's license
[27:31] marriage license any kind of license all
[27:35] of that has been so copied or you know
[27:40] until it no longer good he said I won't
[27:44] take my my birth certificate down do you
[27:50] know another thing that your record in a
[27:54] church of being baptized and the day you
[27:59] was baptized well you want to call it
[28:01] christening where you own the caller
[28:03] that's a better record than your birth
[28:06] certificate you go down now to get your
[28:12] driver's license what do you got to do
[28:14] come on win Georgia I gotta get mine
[28:16] pretty quick you gotta have about three
[28:20] proofs who you are take your birth
[28:23] certificate in let down the old driver's
[28:26] license will you picture on it and
[28:30] you're standing there
[28:31] looks like that'd be enough no mm-hmm
[28:37] your telephone bill your electric bill
[28:43] you got to take something else besides
[28:46] your birth certificate right to prove
[28:51] who you are well as I said about your
[28:57] telephone number see the reason they
[28:59] want that is because everybody has a
[29:02] telephone number he said was social
[29:04] security number no there's so much
[29:07] falsified about it you know until it's
[29:10] just they've done that only one time
[29:12] they had guy was drawn trying to draw
[29:15] unemployment the same time I tried to
[29:16] draw it
[29:18] they held mine for about three months
[29:21] before I got it see somebody had copied
[29:25] my social security number like the
[29:28] security man talking to me one day
[29:30] because we purchased a bunch of stuff he
[29:32] wanted know if it was me I see you guys
[29:34] at me and I said but I'm not gonna give
[29:37] you this out of the other he said look
[29:38] feller he said don't worry about it
[29:42] he said I can get your social security
[29:44] number he said all I got to do is just
[29:47] keep typing do I get it yeah but he said
[29:52] the thing just don't do that don't tell
[29:56] them the secret things that you put on
[29:57] your credit card you know like your
[29:58] mother's maiden name your your etc and
[30:02] he said the expiration date is a great
[30:04] thing on it see there's something my
[30:07] point eaters to try to prove who we are
[30:12] and like a man told me one time he said
[30:15] you wouldn't try to get some credit I
[30:17] think Zach did too and he couldn't get
[30:21] no credit he didn't know nobody but
[30:25] couldn't get no credit then there are
[30:31] certain things that you've got to have
[30:32] to prove who you are what's your point
[30:36] brother Dale I'm not trying now we
[30:40] believe in Luther's justification I
[30:42] believe in that I believe in Wesley's
[30:45] sanctification right I believe we must
[30:47] go through that in this day
[30:49] justification sanctification before we
[30:51] can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:53] when you burn I believe in that all
[30:55] right but yet I'm not trying to preach
[30:58] Luther's message that's where you see
[31:04] the people of the message of preachers
[31:06] you know just believe just believe just
[31:08] believe just really believe the Prophet
[31:10] that's Luther's message all right what's
[31:13] the others Wesley's message what don't
[31:16] cut your hair don't punch your face
[31:17] don't don't worry these clothes don't do
[31:19] this don't do that
[31:20] that's Wesley's message well what's the
[31:24] other part of it
[31:28] Pinnacle's I have within me I feel the
[31:33] Spirit of God and it verifies it as the
[31:36] Spirit of God because it agrees for the
[31:37] prophets message I've heard a lot of
[31:43] people say that they had the spirit that
[31:45] agreed with the prophets message but
[31:47] when I got through talking a little bit
[31:48] they of course didn't like me but you
[31:56] know how it is
[31:56] but listen Church the point is what
[32:00] we're not trying to manifest the words
[32:02] of the other ages that is not the seed
[32:07] for this age this is the age of the
[32:12] fully matured word it's not the age of
[32:16] Luther or the west near Pentecost so we
[32:19] don't have to worry about being that
[32:21] let's find out what it is for this age
[32:25] we know what that he is right it's the
[32:28] messenger the hour to message you the
[32:33] hour has a lot in it it's got to be made
[32:36] manifest why because I'm a firm believer
[32:41] they without us could not be made
[32:44] perfect I've made my people to a plane
[32:48] about the latents the things being blunt
[32:51] could have always been that way honest
[32:53] never said nothing about this that or
[32:56] the other but I do believe that that
[32:59] prophets in the grave waiting on you and
[33:00] I to come to the place in the message to
[33:05] pull him out I do believe that but now
[33:11] see them to do that we must be the word
[33:13] of the age we told me this morning
[33:17] there's a man here they could turn on
[33:18] the lights where he said you always send
[33:20] somebody that the word can get into my
[33:30] foreknowledge
[33:31] God knew everybody'd be sitting here
[33:35] today right now he didn't make you come
[33:42] because that's overriding here free
[33:44] moral agency but he knew you'd be here
[33:47] all right
[33:49] and he knew that you would be in this
[33:52] age trying to believe this message okay
[33:56] and in doing that see then there'd be
[33:59] somebody as we said this morning that
[34:03] would make that word manifest I believe
[34:10] and will prove in a few minutes from
[34:12] some quotes that you and I have to be
[34:16] the word made manifest and not just as a
[34:23] part as we'll get to it the Lord willing
[34:28] Sunday when the Prophet will say that
[34:30] Mary was not even the seed then we know
[34:34] she was in the basis that she was a
[34:36] child of God but she was not the seed in
[34:40] the example he was bringing he said she
[34:44] gave birth she had it in her womb but
[34:49] she's not the seed he said the prophets
[34:52] were carriers what you see he allotted
[35:03] so much word for each age we gave you
[35:06] that this morning kind of down at the
[35:07] end and allotting that word for the age
[35:11] that you and I are living somebody's
[35:14] gonna make that alive sure it has to be
[35:17] quickened but before it can be quickened
[35:20] it's got to be planted all right to
[35:24] admit they would have to come a prophet
[35:27] to preach the entire word right you
[35:32] remember what what was one of the last
[35:34] ones that we we come to oh yeah we're
[35:41] talking about Feast of the trumpets he
[35:44] said now remember God is the word in
[35:47] each age has allotted he has lauded the
[35:49] word for each age that would be on the
[35:52] earth he lauded it in
[35:54] the church age and the seven seals
[35:57] revealed every bit of it so the seals
[36:00] opened up to reveal what the word that
[36:05] was to be in this age okay
[36:08] so there's got to be a word has got to
[36:11] be it's veiled as we covered this
[36:15] morning
[36:16] he said you it's veiled you realize that
[36:20] Satan cannot um this is mr. point but
[36:27] you don't Satan we think he's really
[36:29] after us if he ever realized in his mind
[36:33] remember what he's got who we are you
[36:38] ain't seen nothing yet you think that
[36:43] the devil died for us he's kind of like
[36:47] brother Moke told me one time he said
[36:48] the devil's after me he said my water
[36:52] pipe busted I said brother mo it's
[36:56] twenty something years old the things
[36:58] were out that ain't the devil after you
[37:02] of course we thank that I had a flat the
[37:09] devil's after me I'm sick the devil's
[37:13] after me that's life
[37:16] that's living when he turns ever friends
[37:23] you got against you when he turned
[37:26] everything against you and one day you
[37:28] go to doctor and the doctor says unless
[37:32] you own OCO Cara you know you know what
[37:37] I mean now calling his name too much you
[37:40] know if you ain't on there we can't
[37:42] treat you we've seen nothing yet folks
[37:48] you label the devil realizes we are what
[37:52] we say we are be gonna come after us
[37:56] it's been preached by the Prophet it's
[38:00] been told us right into the rapture we
[38:03] don't have to have somebody else to come
[38:04] and tell us something
[38:05] he's already priestess to the rapture
[38:08] all right but somebody's got to make it
[38:12] manifest now I believe the devil was
[38:20] after brother Branham don't you why
[38:23] because he could certainly see that he
[38:25] was the word for the hour and the
[38:28] prophets message and the thing to be
[38:30] made manifest in the day so he attacked
[38:33] him on never hand turning everybody
[38:36] against him doing everything see because
[38:42] he was istream he didn't bother with the
[38:46] Lord Jesus when he was healing the sick
[38:49] right now come on him a rock
[38:52] I tried to make a biblical point out of
[38:54] it he didn't bother Jesus until he began
[38:58] to say I and my father are one my
[39:04] brother brother said when the bride says
[39:06] that then the devil is coming after the
[39:12] bride wouldn't begin to say I and my
[39:15] father are one
[39:16] well in a way we are don't worry about
[39:20] that they don't concern him at all and I
[39:24] hope you remember think about this in
[39:26] the right way
[39:27] I'm not against any of these people that
[39:29] come out in the message and do the
[39:31] things but you ever notice somebody come
[39:34] along with a new idea right people just
[39:40] flock to it old and young they just
[39:44] flock to that let's see the devil he
[39:49] kind of goes along well because he
[39:56] realizes they're seeing something
[39:58] different so he wonders yeah who it is
[40:04] he's wondering if it was the truth or
[40:07] not
[40:09] but then after a while he just slides in
[40:13] and everything goes haywire he just
[40:18] backs out dying the life and said that
[40:20] wasn't it
[40:21] come on can a quote said I thought I got
[40:26] you when I got Moses and isn't that in
[40:29] the other he said I'm sure I got you
[40:31] when I got John the Baptist John the
[40:36] Baptist wasn't too bad even introducing
[40:38] the Messiah but wouldn't again tell
[40:40] Herod he wasn't supposed to be held that
[40:43] wife then he got in trouble he got a
[40:45] little marriage and divorce hooked up
[40:47] his messes huh what you see Church when
[40:55] the bride realized who she is and what
[40:59] she's here for Satan's go to come after
[41:03] her but as long as we keep playing
[41:08] around go on but what do you mean
[41:10] brother then I go to church I'm their
[41:12] ever service that's a good record we'll
[41:16] give you a star a gold button or
[41:21] something you know is it a drudgery to
[41:28] go to church no it should be an
[41:33] enjoyment right if I could do that in
[41:39] the Baptist Church and that won't and
[41:41] I'm throwing that back that away okay
[41:43] land it in your lap okay if we could do
[41:50] that then what about now but do you
[41:53] realize what I'm getting out we've had
[41:57] the message right are you looking for
[42:01] another prophet to come no not to the
[42:04] Gentiles all right then why sit around
[42:08] twiddling their thumbs waiting on
[42:10] somebody and isn't that the way it
[42:14] generally happens you let things start
[42:18] moving and people just run to it
[42:21] I said there's 40 years ago cuz I quoted
[42:28] brother random about probably ten years
[42:32] before the anymore when he said they had
[42:34] come a time when the Methodists and the
[42:37] Baptist would be healing the sick and
[42:39] the things would be happening in the
[42:42] church he was evidently looking at it
[42:49] you know so now when you begin to talk
[42:53] about manifestation they said what are
[42:55] you talking about we got more than you
[42:57] got in a little our cases a half but see
[43:05] they're not trying to be one thing the
[43:09] light of the age they're only concerned
[43:11] with being going to church being good
[43:18] building giving away right and there's
[43:25] nothing wrong with all of that no
[43:28] problem but listen Church if God is not
[43:36] complete without you then he's waving
[43:41] with you and I to realize that yeah but
[43:47] I just don't understand I mean I don't
[43:48] understand either I don't understand how
[43:53] you and I certainly don't understand I
[43:55] took me I mean I thought if that's not
[43:58] just throwing into remark I don't see
[44:02] how I told you about the time when that
[44:04] men passed me going down the road a
[44:06] Baptist preacher you know the Lord why
[44:09] in the world did you choose me and
[44:11] didn't choose him well that man was so
[44:13] popular so great a God I mean great no
[44:15] words ever against him it took it was
[44:18] eight preachers I believe was the number
[44:19] they preached a man's funeral he was
[44:24] known by everybody in the country as a
[44:26] good man and good you know I said Lord
[44:31] why did you choose me
[44:34] to allow this word to be revealed to me
[44:37] well then after a while he said well
[44:40] maybe he turned it down somewhere you
[44:44] see that could be true I don't know I'm
[44:47] still saying why did he choose any of us
[44:50] but he won't somebody well what we won't
[44:55] is a group when sister so-and-so gets
[44:59] traitor brother Shawn's will get
[45:01] straight we're always trying to find
[45:03] trouble in the church don't worry about
[45:06] it there plenty of it but when you're
[45:08] trying to find trouble in the church
[45:10] you're the trouble I don't back up why
[45:18] probably said first pray right he said
[45:24] go run your mouth he said pray but
[45:27] listen Church the word of each age had
[45:34] to have somebody and it's come down to
[45:38] this age we're not in those other ages
[45:42] we've got to find this age and find the
[45:48] word that's predestinated from God
[45:51] eternally we want to look at the vessel
[45:57] to this in we want to doubt the things
[46:02] that it's in unless in another day we
[46:04] was a brother branham we tell them in
[46:05] Isaiah he said a man like me with faults
[46:08] and failures this way says but said God
[46:14] gave him the word
[46:21] what about the age we're living God is
[46:28] the word in each age has he he has
[46:31] blotted the word for the age that would
[46:34] be on the earth and the seven seals
[46:36] revealed every bit of it so then we're
[46:42] not looking for somebody to talk about
[46:44] something else if somebody come along
[46:48] now and started talking about the great
[46:50] millennial reign is next
[46:54] what would you say he said the next
[47:00] thing is a great millennium I'll give
[47:04] you that quote a lot of time that no
[47:06] we're brother Brown said if I don't see
[47:08] you no more see to future home people
[47:10] for next things a future home prophet
[47:13] said it
[47:15] no he's already said there's a rapture
[47:17] the tribulation a millennium a white
[47:21] throne like a fire and all as I and then
[47:27] the future all know somebody comes along
[47:34] now start telling you about this great
[47:36] millennial rang with Nixon Anna
[47:40] that's a wellness he his opinion
[47:42] certainly ain't mine no the next thing
[47:46] according to me is a rapture right you
[47:51] ever studied some of the Jehovah Witness
[47:55] doctrines about things you realize what
[47:58] I'm getting at though their ideas
[48:00] according to what I've talked to him
[48:01] their ideas we're going along here today
[48:03] and tomorrow I witnessed in this great
[48:06] utopia but we're all going to work well
[48:10] driving school bus as well but
[48:11] everybody's happy
[48:12] I don't think that's gonna be at you but
[48:22] you see the church what I'm getting at
[48:24] we have a word and we must make that
[48:29] word manifest see we want to lay there
[48:33] vet on brother branham is that
[48:35] the way he said it did he say it this
[48:39] way he said we want to put it on the
[48:42] preacher and let the preacher do to pray
[48:44] anything he said that is Catholicism
[48:52] paraphrasing you know what he said it
[48:55] was he said the Pope come out of that
[49:00] hey I got to do all your praying if I
[49:05] got to do all your stuff give me a
[49:06] billfold I mean if someone get prayed
[49:09] for you laugh at that that's what the
[49:13] Catholics do right you pay you pay you
[49:15] pay they do it for you well no we don't
[49:18] believe in that no believe in trying to
[49:24] be the word of the agent we're living
[49:27] and that's all I've ever preached for
[49:29] forty some years now is to try to get to
[49:33] you and I'd to see who we are the first
[49:38] message I preached in 1969 in Athens
[49:42] Georgia was the bride of Jesus Christ
[49:45] would be the son of man Holly eyes
[49:55] Athens Georgia the bride would be the
[50:01] son of man you know what I had to keep
[50:06] saying brother Bradley's not the son of
[50:08] man brother Branham is a son of man God
[50:10] every time I turn around that thing is
[50:11] hitting me
[50:12] we've had these on a man right around
[50:14] his dick no we brought around a wouldn't
[50:15] be son of man he said he wasn't he said
[50:20] he was ice on a man what he done that to
[50:23] fool you well he done a good job but
[50:28] listen Church there's a predestinated
[50:33] seed it comes predestinated eternally
[50:41] right seed our word so ever age was
[50:48] predestinated better unsaid about that
[50:53] little woman as well
[50:54] he could have said how could that seed I
[50:57] forgot to exact wording but he said work
[50:59] its way down into that situation but it
[51:02] works looked like it would come into
[51:06] high priest or somebody else right but
[51:09] instead it worked out a little
[51:10] prostitute waiting on the lot to strike
[51:24] he's kind of like I remember brother
[51:25] would be saying what time that is a good
[51:27] point he said people don't think too
[51:30] much of me some way paraphrasing it but
[51:34] he said they want an Abraham he said
[51:39] willing did you get your Abraham said he
[51:41] gave his wife away in lied he said at
[51:43] least ain't never gave him a wife away
[51:46] well that was a good point but listen
[51:54] many are the flaws I'm not quoting for
[51:57] the church age book of those that lied
[52:00] cheated steal done all kind of thing but
[52:03] yet they were the word benefit for the
[52:05] Aged there were they be Martin Luther
[52:08] you believe he was he in the message he
[52:10] brought was the word for that age you
[52:12] believe that you know he was a
[52:13] Trinitarian you know he didn't want to
[52:18] I've got his own riding he didn't want
[52:20] to leave the Catholic Church he wanted
[52:22] to convert it moat to pop and sit in the
[52:29] pub drinking beer are you throwing off
[52:35] on it no he's telling the truth about
[52:37] him you know what he said one day fight
[52:42] am I wrong in this now if I am correct
[52:44] me he said the Jews ordered me took out
[52:45] to be killed because they killed Jesus
[52:48] Christ I'm pretty sure that goes for
[52:51] that if not that's Dale quote do what
[52:53] you're going to but listen Church my
[52:58] point is we're looking at each other
[53:01] trying to judge whether that person is
[53:05] what they think they are but you know
[53:11] what they're looking at you you know
[53:17] that old song years ago I'm looking back
[53:19] to see if he's looking back to see is he
[53:24] listen Church
[53:27] I believe the Prophet brought the
[53:32] message but people don't want me to
[53:36] quote these quotes you know that
[53:38] brethren said the bride must vindicate
[53:42] Malachi 4 luke 1730 what do you mean you
[53:55] don't believe God's indicator Eve
[53:58] indicated to man yes he did but
[54:02] somebody's got to vindicate his message
[54:06] he vindicated a man and he would stand
[54:10] and say if I preached the truth you come
[54:15] and show me and show you that's right
[54:17] God will come down and heal the sick and
[54:19] he done it right and yet he was
[54:22] preaching the white horse rider what
[54:26] does the Holy Ghost you see we don't get
[54:32] into that do we we don't want to talk
[54:35] like that cuz you making him just a
[54:37] human being no no that's what he was but
[54:43] I've got it it's in one of these notes
[54:45] in here Malachi 4 was a predestinated
[54:49] seed I said exactly what I meant go
[54:55] that's what he say it it's to see the
[54:58] country yes in 80 turn Malachi 4 was
[55:00] predestinated eternally the man that
[55:07] have come through was predestinated by
[55:10] foreknowledge to bring the word but the
[55:15] seed he wrought was he predestinated
[55:16] eternally Missy then if that's right
[55:24] then ever word in God's Bible is
[55:28] predestinated for somebody to live it
[55:33] somebody to make it alive somebody to
[55:39] make it manifest
[55:41] look what he says on there where we
[55:43] stopped this morning turn on the lights
[55:45] priests in 64 it meets that condition
[55:49] every time that God manifest is liked
[55:53] the word itself once the world scuse me
[55:57] itself rejects that light why it's
[56:02] written in the Bible he's aged God has
[56:07] allotted so much of his word for each
[56:09] age and he always sends somebody to
[56:13] manifest that word he lauded it for the
[56:19] age he predestinated it before the world
[56:22] it was predestinated eternally from God
[56:28] the day would be a day when Martin
[56:34] Luther would protest the Catholic Church
[56:35] I go to that because that's where people
[56:37] don't like me to go it's ok we go to
[56:40] Paul or Peter something they don't like
[56:45] for you to hang on to those signs
[56:48] there's a man here that can turn on the
[56:51] light 65 and all ages God has set for so
[56:55] much of his word for each age
[56:58] God always sends somebody that that word
[57:02] can get into and show the light of that
[57:06] ever age it does the same thing always
[57:10] does that a predestinated word Malachi 4
[57:20] Luke 17 30 that's why you heard no no
[57:25] writers Pauline him didn't even write of
[57:27] son of man I don't want to wrote about
[57:30] it was the Apostles that wrote in their
[57:32] day of what Jesus said son of man show
[57:37] me in the Bible or fouling him wrote
[57:38] about son of man no they didn't get that
[57:42] did they didn't bring it out because
[57:47] they didn't get it it was not the age
[57:49] but here comes a prophet even back in
[57:52] the forties and
[57:53] fifties speaking of the son of man he
[58:01] said the Son of Man is the Word made
[58:03] flesh well I've read about know the Son
[58:11] of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ now
[58:18] watch what he says here on prices
[58:20] identified 64 so in each age when God
[58:30] locks his word for each age now what's
[58:33] his order then when that word is ready
[58:36] to be manifested let's search the
[58:41] scriptures don't just take my word when
[58:47] that word is ready to be manifested then
[58:52] God sends down a prophet and reveals the
[58:56] word to his prophet are you getting it
[59:04] God was ready in the days of Martin
[59:07] Luther a man drops down it's a burden
[59:11] his heart and God uses him to bring a
[59:16] message moved on with John Wesley moved
[59:21] on to Azusa Street moved on to the end
[59:24] time prophet right did you read what our
[59:28] listen to what I'm reading when that
[59:31] word is ready to be manifested he quotes
[59:35] that twiced
[59:36] then God sends a prophet to do what and
[59:44] when the word is ready to be made
[59:45] manifest he's sent a prophet to bring
[59:49] the word come on we can't get it without
[59:51] that when God is ready for something to
[59:57] happen the Prophet came on the scene are
[1:00:01] you listening ninis word can be made
[1:00:04] manifest through him
[1:00:07] now we're gonna get on down here little
[1:00:09] fighter
[1:00:09] where there's got to be somebody then
[1:00:12] make that manifest
[1:00:14] oh it's brother branham's manifestation
[1:00:17] I'm not dumb about the gifts the signs
[1:00:19] and wonder what was the manifestation to
[1:00:22] show he was a prophet the word that he
[1:00:26] brought not two signs and wonders go
[1:00:29] Satan can impersonate not gifts etc it's
[1:00:36] whether or not he stays with the word a
[1:00:39] properties not judged by signs signs
[1:00:43] always come with a profit but they
[1:00:47] follow false ones too when I started
[1:00:54] studying this message brother moment was
[1:00:57] telling me about
[1:00:58] he said I've seen the dead raised I've
[1:00:59] seen this thick heel I said brother mo I
[1:01:03] said I believe you I don't believe you
[1:01:05] liked him ago then don't eat up I said
[1:01:09] you tell me what the man talked I'll
[1:01:14] know whether he was a prophet or not
[1:01:18] that was the words I told him you know
[1:01:21] why cuz he come out with the same things
[1:01:25] cuz I've already read a little bit what
[1:01:27] run around and said you know and he says
[1:01:32] if it comes out with the same old
[1:01:34] message and don't matter signs and
[1:01:38] wonder fathers it I serve words you did
[1:01:42] that quote you know matter signs in the
[1:01:46] earth followers these people that run
[1:01:49] off I told you the same time I told you
[1:01:51] many years ago that I'd read where the
[1:01:54] prophet said these things would take
[1:01:56] place I told you I said it'll come a day
[1:01:58] when the two souls seventh under verse
[1:02:01] approves etc all those doctors will be
[1:02:04] having signs and wonders and they will
[1:02:09] say we are of God cause look what is
[1:02:12] taking place but if they don't stay with
[1:02:18] a word
[1:02:21] right I can't trust anything else little
[1:02:27] run said Satan can pass out supernatural
[1:02:30] gifts now you want to argue with brother
[1:02:33] branham but he can't stay with that word
[1:02:40] that's the one thing he can't do
[1:02:42] he'll take so much of it sure he said
[1:02:47] enough to make it work but he won't stay
[1:02:50] with the word just keep quoting it to
[1:02:53] him you get talking somebody you know
[1:02:56] and they really laying down time till
[1:02:58] you just start talking about the word
[1:03:01] right
[1:03:03] Lulla eyes like these girls went to camp
[1:03:10] one time and they were talking from here
[1:03:15] and this person came up said I know
[1:03:17] where you went to church or go to church
[1:03:21] said you go to little Georgia you know
[1:03:26] what because they was quoting some
[1:03:29] things that we talked right just speak
[1:03:38] the word the devil can't stand out now
[1:03:46] so when the word is ready to be made
[1:03:49] manifest god it is mine looks down see
[1:03:52] the ages the times he sends a prophet to
[1:03:57] bring the word all right
[1:03:59] same message paragraph 123 tries to
[1:04:03] identify the same in all generations
[1:04:05] when Jesus come he was the word
[1:04:08] so was Moses the word Moses the rest of
[1:04:13] the prophets was the word but they were
[1:04:16] the word in portion P ort eilean as you
[1:04:20] miss my southern language they don't
[1:04:23] mean potion portion
[1:04:29] look they were the word in Porsche
[1:04:33] he was the word in food he was a
[1:04:38] fullness of the word he was the word
[1:04:40] who's that speaking up it's a Porsche
[1:04:44] another word for each age and how does
[1:04:48] he make it known he makes it known by
[1:04:52] servants the prophets if you don't
[1:05:00] understand where I put all the emphasis
[1:05:02] then you're blind anyway don't forget it
[1:05:04] you don't brew light up with all the
[1:05:06] images on everything that I've ever
[1:05:08] taught is to come right out of the
[1:05:09] message listen the message presume in
[1:05:17] 1962 but that predestinated Word of God
[1:05:22] laying out younger will bring that
[1:05:26] predestinated one I'm reading what he
[1:05:32] says but that predestinated Word of God
[1:05:38] laying out yonder will bring that
[1:05:40] predestinated one when he speaks he will
[1:05:44] come to the earth to the glory under
[1:05:48] helloo you know under job said I will
[1:05:51] restore when the predestinated word of
[1:05:55] god laying out younger will bring that
[1:05:57] predestinated one that'll bring God
[1:06:01] among us are you listening mm-hmm
[1:06:05] restoration to the bride tree 1962
[1:06:08] paragraph 170 but the birth the new
[1:06:12] Burke that comes by Christ cannot die
[1:06:15] that's one tree and the other tree
[1:06:19] remember he talks about the two trees do
[1:06:21] that and this tree though it's been
[1:06:24] persecuted made fun of us since the very
[1:06:27] beginning of the Garden of Eden it
[1:06:29] cannot die its predestinated it's been
[1:06:34] clubbed and beat and my everything done
[1:06:37] to it and what happened
[1:06:38] it cannot die he is he
[1:06:42] will not die he can't because he's
[1:06:45] holding in him the predestinated Word of
[1:06:48] God it has to come forth for us his
[1:06:52] fruit in his season predestinated season
[1:06:57] Luther had the message predestinated
[1:07:00] season Wesley had the message
[1:07:02] predestinated season for there our the
[1:07:05] Prophet had the message predestinated CD
[1:07:08] now you and I have got to give birth to
[1:07:09] that seat right come on proving his word
[1:07:16] 1964 how does he make his word known to
[1:07:20] the people first God knowing that there
[1:07:23] would be unbelievers and watch the
[1:07:25] wisdom of God knowing that there would
[1:07:27] be unbelievers and how the majority
[1:07:30] would be unbelievers
[1:07:32] he by foreknowledge predestinated a seed
[1:07:36] forever age that would believe it
[1:07:44] predestinated a seed that would believe
[1:07:47] it what by foreknowledge he said he by
[1:07:52] foreknowledge right predestinated a seed
[1:07:57] forever age that would believe it I
[1:08:03] believe in predestination folks I
[1:08:05] believe in the seed of God being
[1:08:07] predestinated eternally I believe people
[1:08:10] come by for knowledge then when you put
[1:08:13] the foreknowledge and the pre
[1:08:15] determining together you can't separate
[1:08:19] the people from the word come on
[1:08:25] and if you'll notice in there for each
[1:08:28] age goes right on with his word
[1:08:30] everything right on time nothing hinders
[1:08:34] God he goes right on and every click is
[1:08:38] moving just exactly right we think
[1:08:41] sometimes it's not going to work right
[1:08:45] but don't you worry his clock is time
[1:08:48] just exactly to the split instant and
[1:08:51] everything's working just exactly right
[1:08:55] well brother that letters don't
[1:08:57] understand how come we're down here
[1:08:58] I hear preachers I've been in sit with
[1:09:02] them they'll have to bite my tongue sit
[1:09:06] with him then say everybody here
[1:09:09] believed it we're gonna be out of here
[1:09:11] by 77 have you heard that
[1:09:22] everybody but brother I a priest in 74
[1:09:27] that we could past year 2026 everybody
[1:09:31] in here you know what that means I'm
[1:09:35] nobody I got it I'm predestinated seed
[1:09:45] paragraph 54 it's the rising of the Sun
[1:09:49] don't fear anymore
[1:09:52] wherever foreordained predestinated seed
[1:09:56] of God she'll come to life when the
[1:09:59] light spreads across the earth of the
[1:10:02] glorious gospel in every age it'll bring
[1:10:06] forth the crop that God ordained it to
[1:10:08] he has raised from the dead see because
[1:10:17] he not only seems his word he seems his
[1:10:20] Holy Spirit too quickly because he goes
[1:10:22] on talks about what is quick made alive
[1:10:26] now let's see if you can believe this
[1:10:30] paragraph 4:15 restoration in the bride
[1:10:33] 362 but what he was God's perfect
[1:10:41] prophet tree the example tree the
[1:10:44] bridegroom tree amen glory I want to say
[1:10:47] something directly if he is the
[1:10:51] bridegroom tree do you believe it that's
[1:10:56] what he asked now do you believe it they
[1:10:57] said Amen from the Garden of Eden
[1:11:02] because he was a seed of the woman right
[1:11:05] then the bridegroom tree without the
[1:11:09] female don't buy fruit so he's got to
[1:11:16] have a bride tree she has got to be
[1:11:21] borned other same material the Word made
[1:11:28] flesh in the tree
[1:11:34] hope you get it it's the same life in
[1:11:37] this female tree the bridegroom as it is
[1:11:42] in the bride same word
[1:11:49] he was the Word made flesh Doug listen
[1:11:55] to what I'm talking about a code I keep
[1:11:56] referring back where you remember it
[1:11:58] Luke there was the Word made flesh for
[1:12:00] his age you know the Lutheran the
[1:12:02] Methodist the Pentecostals the Prophet
[1:12:08] in our day but what about me and you
[1:12:11] when we just sitting around waiting on
[1:12:13] the bus goes but we you know we can't
[1:12:16] find ourselves these two the trumpets
[1:12:23] preached in 1964 paragraph 115 but it
[1:12:29] will come that is his promise for this
[1:12:33] age we're living in the age that his
[1:12:40] coming will be in she must be identified
[1:12:45] in him any woman must be identified with
[1:12:49] her husband brother 2 or 1 and Christ
[1:12:53] bride had to be identified with him for
[1:12:57] the two or one and he is a word not to
[1:13:00] denomination the word we are to be the
[1:13:05] children of the light and the light is
[1:13:09] the word which is made light for this
[1:13:12] age how do you know light except it
[1:13:18] comes from the word all right then we're
[1:13:27] still reading you might want to write
[1:13:30] that down
[1:13:31] these two the trumpets to be 64 719 the
[1:13:34] morning service paragraph 115 no he
[1:13:39] talks about the children of the light
[1:13:41] and the light is a word which is made
[1:13:43] life for this age
[1:13:45] how do we know light except it comes
[1:13:47] from the work all right
[1:13:49] the word made flesh is the light of the
[1:13:53] age when you see it and the Bible said
[1:13:59] so the word made flesh is the light of
[1:14:06] the age why can't we say the bride is
[1:14:14] the word made flesh and it's with the
[1:14:17] lights from the rising of the Sun 65
[1:14:19] 4:18 prayer at 168 that's that divine
[1:14:23] revelation of the word made flesh
[1:14:27] it was flesh in that day by the Sun the
[1:14:32] groom it's the flesh today by the bride
[1:14:42] its flesh today so when it says you
[1:14:49] remember I told you this morning John
[1:14:54] 1:14 1 1 1 through 14 says he's the word
[1:15:01] and he created all things then it says
[1:15:05] the Prophet comes to introduce a lot of
[1:15:08] the age that the Prophet is not the
[1:15:11] light but he's the one to introduce then
[1:15:17] he comes down and says but that will
[1:15:19] make us sons and daughters of the Living
[1:15:22] God verse 13 and then he says and the
[1:15:27] word was made flesh sure the word is
[1:15:35] gonna have to be made flesh by somebody
[1:15:37] why can't we believe with him brother
[1:15:45] Branham said you Pentecostals if you
[1:15:47] won't go God will raise up Baptist and
[1:15:51] Methodist Mao said this one God raised
[1:15:55] up blue lights
[1:15:57] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholics
[1:16:02] ain't no telling what else is sitting in
[1:16:05] here today the Pentecostals rejected it
[1:16:13] right but the little bride says be it
[1:16:18] unto me according to thy word
[1:16:21] but around sin spoken words regional
[1:16:23] seat
[1:16:24] he said when she says that I mean we
[1:16:30] quote that ten thousand times
[1:16:32] so did Luke there ten thousand times of
[1:16:34] the Jesse lived my faith one day it was
[1:16:37] sparked alive he said when the bride
[1:16:41] begins to say I'm my father one we can
[1:16:45] say that ten thousand times but when
[1:16:47] it's revealed he says when the bride
[1:16:50] says be it unto me according to thy word
[1:16:54] he said sparks will fly my sin smoking
[1:16:59] words of reason Oh see sparks will fly
[1:17:01] when somebody begins to say I and my
[1:17:05] father are one and he said let me quote
[1:17:11] it with it and these other things get
[1:17:15] that quote and look at that he said in
[1:17:17] these other things what when the bride B
[1:17:21] begins to be the word and believe she is
[1:17:30] the word Satan was gonna get mad at her
[1:17:35] well brother Dale don't preach it he
[1:17:38] won't get mad at us then let me just say
[1:17:43] it plain language shut the doors we
[1:17:46] ain't the predestinated see it was a
[1:17:48] predestinated seed don't say that the
[1:17:52] predestinated seed was one in Mary that
[1:17:54] said be it unto me according to thy word
[1:18:04] predestinated seed in the little woman
[1:18:06] at the whales says we know when the
[1:18:09] Messiah coming you'll do these time
[1:18:15] faith always comes by hearing and
[1:18:20] hearing by the word a predestinated
[1:18:28] chosen seed of God waiting on the church
[1:18:33] to be able to say that's me what about
[1:18:38] Jesus you think he didn't have to go
[1:18:40] that away what about it in Luke one then
[1:18:44] he was quoting Isaiah 62 the Spirit of
[1:18:47] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:18:48] anointed me to bring he said this day
[1:18:51] this scripture is fulfilled you know
[1:18:55] what that was the day it was quickened
[1:18:57] to him what he was doing you know what I
[1:18:59] didn't mean it you know what he would do
[1:19:01] it it was quickened to him that he was
[1:19:03] Isaiah
[1:19:03] when he spoke up when you and I get to
[1:19:08] the flesh one of these days do we quit
[1:19:11] thinking about our own selves and what
[1:19:12] we are and what we got this that or the
[1:19:14] other or whatever and start realizing
[1:19:17] what God has said about us let me at
[1:19:22] least say what he said I said that in
[1:19:26] the 60s now I'm saying it today let me
[1:19:30] say what he said if I can't make it
[1:19:34] manifest let somebody pick that up and
[1:19:39] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord
[1:19:42] and be that then I've done my job I pray
[1:19:51] that you understand what I'm trying to
[1:19:52] bring I'm trying to talk about you not
[1:19:56] me that's why the people couldn't
[1:20:02] understand come on music they couldn't
[1:20:04] understand brother Branham knows even
[1:20:06] the haters thought he were talking about
[1:20:08] his own self even though their own
[1:20:10] saying
[1:20:13] he said I'm just the one that's spire to
[1:20:17] be used for the time yes don't mean the
[1:20:26] man had seen the dead raised to stick
[1:20:27] healed and everything that could be
[1:20:29] taking place and he'd say don't make
[1:20:32] nothing out of me there's all him now do
[1:20:43] you see why I said this morning it's
[1:20:45] 100% God the Bible is but our people
[1:20:50] that received the Word of God and have
[1:20:54] made manifest the god that we talk about
[1:20:57] in the day they were living so why can't
[1:21:00] we start saying what he said you know he

[1:21:06] started making this statement he said I
[1:21:09] call you bride right I called you bride
[1:21:17] but then when you get over the
[1:21:19] revelation that said his wife has made
[1:21:23] herself ready more than just a bride

[1:21:30] picture of how beautiful you are read
