[2:15] Good to be back. Brother Richard Wilson
[2:17] said to tell each one of you hello and
[2:19] God bless you. Really enjoyed the
[2:21] weekend with them and u uh tentatively
[2:25] uh the second weekend in June. Uh
[2:28] they're coming down here. Um I don't
[2:30] know how much of their church is coming,
[2:32] but brother Steven will be doing
[2:34] Saturday service and then brother
[2:36] Richard will be doing Sunday service. So
[2:38] we'll have them down the second weekend
[2:41] in June. Uh so far they said
[2:45] tentatively. So we'll just say
[2:46] tentatively and then maybe some of them
[2:49] can come too. But we'll let you know and
[2:51] we'll uh um keep you updated on that.
[2:54] Brother David, good to have you still
[2:56] here, man. Good to see you again.
[2:59] Heading back home. Okay. All right. Tell
[3:02] everybody out there we said hello and I
[3:04] hope we treated you well.
[3:06] You're not shaking your head. Okay.
[3:08] Thank you. Just flip and smile.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Be good to have you here, buddy.
[3:13] Come back and visit anytime. Very
[3:16] welcome.
[3:17] Uh, if you got your Bibles, let's turn
[3:19] to There's not much for announcement
[3:20] except this weekend coming up. We got
[3:21] the fellowship meeting at 3:00. Brother,
[3:24] um, Daryl Ward will be with us. I just
[3:26] talked to him a little while ago and
[3:27] he's he's excited about coming. We
[3:30] always he always comes in June and and u
[3:33] I'll tell you one reason why. Because I
[3:36] don't think I've ever met a more humble
[3:38] man.
[3:42] that's got the word of the Lord in his
[3:44] life and a testimony like you wouldn't
[3:46] believe than than him than brother
[3:49] Daryl. And I want to be humble like him.
[3:54] I don't want to be him. I just want to
[3:56] be humble like him. So I tell him, I
[3:58] said, "You come in January and you get
[4:00] us all started right and we'll try our
[4:02] best to uh to be a little more humble."
[4:05] I just He's got just a wonderful spirit
[4:08] and he's always done us good. So, we
[4:10] appreciate having him and thank you all
[4:12] the sisters beforehand and and brothers
[4:15] for um making the food for us and uh and
[4:19] all for the weekend. So, we sure
[4:21] appreciate that. So, I don't think we
[4:23] have any other mount announcements
[4:24] coming up. We got some later on in the
[4:26] year, but um let's uh anybody got an
[4:30] unspoken request? I know something on
[4:32] your heart. We had a lot of things on
[4:34] our heart lately. So, um, you just pray
[4:36] in your own way and we'll just ask the
[4:38] Lord to help us each one. So, let's bow
[4:40] our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[4:42] thank you so much for giving us a a
[4:44] Wednesday night, Lord. We got up this
[4:46] morning, did our things, Lord, as
[4:47] humans. And Lord, now we come, Lord, for
[4:50] just a few minutes, Lord, to hear from
[4:51] you, Father. And Lord, may you bless
[4:53] each one that's here, Father. Be the
[4:54] ones that are sick, the ones that are
[4:56] not with us, Lord. Be the ones that are
[4:58] traveling,
[5:00] Lord. especially be ones that are sin
[5:02] sick, Father, that you'll be with them,
[5:04] Lord, and and stir their water, Lord,
[5:06] and and bring them back to you, Father.
[5:09] We long to see the day that some of
[5:11] these faces that we've lost from the
[5:14] devil taking a hold of their life. We,
[5:16] Lord, you're greater than him. Greater
[5:20] is he that's in us. So we need to
[5:21] project that to the people, Lord, that
[5:23] we've lost a hold of maybe, Lord,
[5:26] through different things, different
[5:27] ways, Father, that we'll that that
[5:29] you'll strike their heart, Lord, and and
[5:31] bring them back into the fold, Father.
[5:33] Um what a great thing, Lord, is to have
[5:36] a soul saved, especially one that we
[5:38] know, Lord. And I pray that you'd be
[5:40] with us now. Take care of us in the
[5:42] firmament of this service. In Jesus name
[5:43] we pray. Amen. So, we're still on the
[5:46] Son of Man. We're going to go to Matthew
[5:48] 24 in a minute, but I want to cover
[5:50] something real quick being the first of
[5:52] the year. Um, I want to ask you a couple
[5:55] of questions and then we'll get started.
[5:57] Because what happened was what stirred
[5:59] Jesus to answer the questions there in
[6:01] Matthew 24 was what? Three questions,
[6:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[6:06] &gt;&gt; When you coming back, what's the sign of
[6:07] the end? And one of the other ones,
[6:08] we'll read them in just a little bit.
[6:10] But they they were they were under
[6:12] expectation
[6:15] but their expectation was wrong
[6:18] &gt;&gt; at the time. But see because they didn't
[6:21] have the Holy Ghost. So see our
[6:23] expectation tonight and any other time
[6:25] without the Holy Ghost your expectation
[6:28] will not be what a Holy Ghost fil person
[6:31] has. Your expectation will cannot touch
[6:34] it.
[6:36] Well don't get quiet. That's absolutely
[6:39] it's your life. It you the expectations
[6:41] we have is far different than we had
[6:44] when we were sinners.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; I hope
[6:47] &gt;&gt; if we can't see the difference then we
[6:48] got a problem. All right. But let's read
[6:51] 1 Corinthians 2 vers9. You can be
[6:52] seated. But as it is written, I have not
[6:55] seen or ear heard, neither have entered
[6:57] into the heart of man the things which
[6:59] God hath prepared for them that love
[7:02] him. But God hath revealed them unto us
[7:05] by his spirit. For the spirit searches
[7:07] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[7:10] But now remember, the deeper we go into
[7:13] God, if you have the new birth and you
[7:16] have a desire to to go higher, this
[7:19] message gets more simple
[7:22] as it gets deeper,
[7:25] &gt;&gt; because remember, even preaching water
[7:28] baptism is deep to people outside of
[7:30] this building.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? But so we but we have
[7:34] that established. That's our established
[7:36] That's our established foundation.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; So now we need to go on and see that we
[7:41] continue on with with baptism of the
[7:44] Holy Spirit and then we continue on with
[7:46] with keep getting baptized and we keep
[7:48] receiving more of the Holy Ghost. All
[7:50] right?
[7:51] &gt;&gt; I mean because there's many anointings.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; There's one baptism but many anointings.
[7:55] And that's what we're looking for
[7:56] because we're anointed people. All
[7:58] right.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; I read you that brother said prophetic
[8:00] people, anointed people.
[8:03] But God hath revealed them unto us by
[8:04] his spirit. For the spirit searches all
[8:06] things, yay, the deep things of God. In
[8:09] other words, even the inmost depths of
[8:12] his very being. Amen. God bless you. You
[8:14] may be seated. You know, there's a lot
[8:16] of people in this world, they know of
[8:17] God. They know maybe there is a God.
[8:21] But remember, the prophet of God told us
[8:23] the great deception in this end time.
[8:25] I'm talking about right now where we're
[8:27] sitting today. The greatest deception is
[8:30] is that people are going to worship the
[8:33] devil thinking they're worshiping God.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Read anointed ones at the end time over
[8:41] and over again.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Because it's the true anointing.
[8:47] There is no false new birth like we know
[8:49] it. There's false birth, but if you got
[8:53] the new birth, it's not false.
[8:55] But Satan's going to make you think you
[8:57] got a birth by even being in
[8:59] sanctification. You can be all cleaned
[9:01] up like Judas was. Judas had a ministry.
[9:03] He could preach.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; He preached the gospel and was happy
[9:07] that the devils were subject to subject
[9:09] to them. And his name was written in the
[9:12] book of life, lamb's book of life.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; That's what we were preaching on up
[9:16] there, Brother Richard, this weekend.
[9:18] But remember, he was erased. He was
[9:21] taken out of the book of life, the
[9:22] lamb's book of life. But there's an
[9:24] eternal section that can never be
[9:26] touched by even God himself
[9:30] &gt;&gt; because he can't change his mind.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; So that Genesis 1:26 man, God can't
[9:34] change his mind. That is his children
[9:37] and his progeny only.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Only that is not mankind. That is not
[9:43] the foolish virgin. That's not Moses,
[9:44] Abraham. That's not John the Baptist.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; That's his progeny, his children, his
[9:51] genealogy.
[9:53] That's his bride, his kids, the ones
[9:56] that he purposed in his mind he was
[9:58] going to have before the foundation of
[10:00] the world. So let us make man in our own
[10:01] image. That's a God that's not making us
[10:07] like we like we had a beginning. You do
[10:09] now have a beginning because of sin. But
[10:12] had there not been a fall, you you
[10:14] didn't have a beginning, you just come
[10:15] right out of the mind of God and be
[10:16] right straight on the earth. You'll be
[10:17] perfect.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; But there would be no savior, no healer,
[10:20] no redeemer. there'd be no attributes of
[10:22] God other than husband or father and
[10:26] that's it. There'd be nothing else. All
[10:28] right. So now that we are able to uh as
[10:31] we were talking about this past weekend,
[10:33] you know, even the angels are going to
[10:35] be judged by us
[10:38] &gt;&gt; and the angels fell
[10:40] &gt;&gt; and they're going to be judged by I was
[10:42] preaching on the book. when I got off
[10:43] the book, Brother Luis was still still
[10:46] preaching on the book and uh how that
[10:49] the book there's not going to be a great
[10:50] big book and in and at the day of
[10:52] judgment and you know that people's
[10:54] going to have to look down and find your
[10:55] name. No, you are the book
[10:58] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says they'll be judged by
[10:59] their works.
[11:01] Brother Boyd, I don't not want to be
[11:03] judged by my words. I don't want to
[11:05] stand before a judgment God because at
[11:08] that time he is judge. I want to stand
[11:11] in judgment, not at judgment.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Because the saints will judge the world.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Your book that you're carrying with you
[11:20] today and and I'm sorry to say, but they
[11:24] turn you down. They've turned God down.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; They turn you down. They turn God down.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; So that's why we're careful, as brother
[11:34] Dick always says, about the fruit that
[11:35] we bruise. Sometimes we get overzealous
[11:38] and we want to tell them God sent a
[11:39] prophet before tell them that God sent
[11:41] his son.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; That should be the last thing you tell
[11:46] them.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; You can get born again without saying
[11:48] brother Brandham or God sent us a
[11:50] prophet. Okay?
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to do that. That's
[11:54] what you ought to be able to do is be
[11:56] able to tell brother said tell your fire
[11:58] got lit.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; And that way it'll make them Lord
[12:01] they'll get warm and they'll see the
[12:03] Lord that you're serving. All right? and
[12:05] then tell them about Acts 2:38. Then
[12:08] tell them about these certain things of
[12:10] no u no eternal hell and and and and no
[12:14] trinitarian doctrine and and u somewhere
[12:17] along the line you'll either peak their
[12:20] interest or or you won't be talking to
[12:22] them very long.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Something will come up and they'll have
[12:26] to leave.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[12:29] But on the day of judgment, could it be
[12:31] that God says, "Hey, I sent you Luis
[12:33] Eurego to tell you about me and you
[12:36] turned him down." Cuz they're going to
[12:38] say, "Where did we turn you down? We
[12:40] never saw you." He said, "Oh, yeah. You
[12:41] saw me and my children. You saw me in my
[12:44] progeny. You saw me in my Genesis 1:26
[12:47] people that are on the earth now.
[12:50] Now
[12:51] to finish this thing,
[12:53] &gt;&gt; there's never been a finisher on earth
[12:55] except today."
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a finisher on the earth
[12:58] today called an end time bride.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; That is the last immorphy of God, which
[13:04] is God in flesh in his people.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; All right? The son of man. Remember, the
[13:11] son of man is the only one that could
[13:13] tell who Judas was.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; I like what brother Richard said. He
[13:18] said, you know, those 11, they were
[13:19] under the son of God anointing after
[13:21] they got new birth. And they really
[13:23] still didn't. I mean, they finally
[13:24] figured out what Judas done because he
[13:25] hung himself, but they didn't know
[13:27] because they were under the son of God
[13:28] anointing.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Only the son of man
[13:33] knows who the devil is at all times.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Only.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; You can be deceived under the son of God
[13:41] anointing. Martin Luther was, Wesley
[13:44] was, Pentecost was. Because listen, any
[13:47] listen to me. Say, say with me. Any
[13:50] &gt;&gt; lot more than that. Any False doctrine
[13:53] could not come from God.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; God may wink at it and carry you through
[13:59] that doctrine,
[14:00] &gt;&gt; but if you're a child of his, you'll
[14:02] come out of that.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "Come out of
[14:04] her, my people."
[14:06] &gt;&gt; So, I want to ask you something tonight.
[14:09] As they were anticipating, they were
[14:12] sitting there. They said, "Lord, when
[14:14] are these things going to happen? When
[14:16] are you coming back? When are you going
[14:17] to restore the temple? when in other
[14:19] words, what are you going to do from
[14:20] this point forward?
[14:22] Well, he really surprised them because
[14:24] he started telling them Matthew 24,
[14:26] there'll be wars, rumors of wars,
[14:28] there'll be false Christ, there'll be
[14:29] false this, there'll be this and that
[14:31] and the other. And they're like,
[14:34] cuz remember Matthew 24, Jesus hadn't
[14:37] went to Calvary yet.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; All right? So, he goes to Calvary,
[14:41] though, he comes back. Listen to me. He
[14:44] is resurrected
[14:46] in a glorified body standing on a
[14:49] mountain with several hundred people,
[14:51] but all of his disciples are there
[14:52] except Judas.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; And they ask him the same question they
[14:58] asked him in Matthew 24. When will you
[15:00] restore the kingdom? That's
[15:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; So it just it went right over their head
[15:06] because they didn't have the new birth.
[15:07] But now see, it'll go all over our head
[15:09] if we don't have the new birth. Right
[15:12] &gt;&gt; now, you can be in sanctification and
[15:14] you can be even at justification and you
[15:17] get peace in the parts of the word, but
[15:19] my heavens, you can't sit in the church
[15:20] 20 years and just and struggle with
[15:23] water baptism,
[15:26] &gt;&gt; struggle with this and that and the
[15:27] other. You can't struggle with that.
[15:28] That struggle's over with.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you tonight just a
[15:32] couple of questions before we get
[15:33] started because they ask him the same
[15:35] questions. But I want to ask you this
[15:37] year, what are you expecting?
[15:41] Brother Brown preached expectation.
[15:43] But what are you expecting? Are you
[15:45] expecting something to take place or are
[15:47] you expecting us to have a fellowship? I
[15:49] mean a a watch night service for 2027.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; This is 2026. This is the year of
[15:55] Jubilee, my friends.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; This is the 70th year after 1977.
[16:01] Brother, Brother Dale told us that years
[16:02] and years ago.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; So this is our Jubilee year. So what are
[16:07] you expecting? I like what brother
[16:09] Steven Wilson said. He said, "Our
[16:11] expectation should not be what time
[16:13] we're leaving this building, but what
[16:15] time we're getting here."
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Run that through your
[16:19] head one more time. Are you coming in
[16:22] here expecting and then a little bit
[16:24] later you want to expect yourself out
[16:26] the door? Are you expecting to hear
[16:28] something and it doesn't matter how long
[16:29] it takes for you to get it?
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; But remember, you're going to be made
[16:36] manifest. You're going to be made known
[16:38] whether you want to or not because the
[16:40] devil in this end time will be exposed
[16:42] by the end time bride, by the son of man
[16:44] ministry.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; And it's got to be through human flesh.
[16:48] It cannot be a tape player tape player.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Human flesh. This is all human now. But
[16:56] God's going to use that humanity,
[17:00] Holy Ghost, plus the word made manifest,
[17:03] the perfect word of God, and he's going
[17:04] to defeat the devil with it.
[17:07] while somebody's still alive.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; So, what's your expectation for this
[17:12] year? Is it more than it is last year?
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Are you expecting to have another watch
[17:20] now service?
[17:22] Let me give you an example because look,
[17:25] an expectation brings a reaction.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; An expectation brings something
[17:31] happening before.
[17:34] How many of you sisters were expecting?
[17:38] If you had children, you were what? You
[17:39] were expecting.
[17:41] Well, now you had to do something before
[17:43] that to be expecting.
[17:45] Something had to be revealed to you
[17:48] between you and your husband, wife,
[17:50] whatever. Okay? Then there's an
[17:53] expectation. That's why we say she's
[17:55] expecting. We don't We used to not say
[17:57] pregnant. We used to say expecting
[17:58] because pregnant was not a good word to
[17:59] say. So, we'd say she's expecting.
[18:01] EXPECTING WHAT? EXPECTING A baby to come
[18:04] out of all this? Are we expecting a body
[18:08] change to come out of all this?
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Are we just going to keep sitting here
[18:12] and keep sitting here and keep sitting
[18:13] here? But our expectation brings a
[18:16] reaction. So, we know what we know this
[18:19] message. Now, everybody sitting in this
[18:22] building today has been in this message
[18:23] more than a year or two or three or
[18:25] four,
[18:27] &gt;&gt; maybe closer to 10. If you're not over
[18:28] 10, you're okay.
[18:30] But anybody over 10 years old, you've
[18:32] been sitting here till you since you was
[18:33] a kid. And then all of us have heard it
[18:35] 30, 40 years. So what are we doing? We
[18:39] must we must look for that reaction.
[18:43] But it needs to be the right reaction
[18:46] because the disciples wanted a reaction
[18:49] from Jesus in Matthew 24. They wanted a
[18:52] reaction from him.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; When you going to restore the kingdom?
[18:55] When you coming back? They wanted
[18:56] something that they could say, "Oh, he's
[18:58] coming back. So he's going to destroy
[19:00] these Romans. He's going to get rid of
[19:01] them. No, he was just starting his
[19:04] kingdom, not ending it.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; There wasn't even anybody that believed
[19:08] him on earth. Nobody believed him till
[19:10] the new birth came.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody did.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; He was seen of 500 people after he
[19:18] resurrected. How in the heavenly days
[19:21] could somebody I saw him I saw him
[19:23] crucified. I saw him put in a tomb. And
[19:26] three days later, he walks into my house
[19:28] and don't even have to open the door
[19:31] &gt;&gt; and ate fish. So he went a ghost.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Yet 500 people out of that 500 people,
[19:38] only 120 took it to heart. The other
[19:40] ones, where'd they go? Well, I think
[19:43] I'll go fishing or or I got a headache
[19:45] or they weren't expecting anything.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; At least the disciples were trying to
[19:51] expect something. So I'm telling you
[19:52] tonight, find out what to expect. you
[19:54] need to be expecting something.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; So brother Brown tells us look not when
[20:00] he starts out doing it but when he
[20:02] begins to sound his message when the
[20:04] message began was when brother Brandham
[20:06] stood that night at the on the first
[20:08] seal and said here stands a lamb with a
[20:10] book in his hand and there goes a wild
[20:12] horse rider that started
[20:15] the thunders that started the headstone
[20:18] coming down that started
[20:21] the third pull. Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; And what happened was a lot of other
[20:27] people, a lot of people sealed it back
[20:30] up.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; But they weren't expecting what they
[20:38] got. They were expecting for brother
[20:40] Bram to come back and them going to
[20:42] rapture right then and there. But what
[20:44] are we are we expecting the same thing?
[20:47] Are we just going to sit here and wait
[20:49] and wait and wait and wait and wait? No.
[20:52] No. What we got to do is as as we were
[20:54] talking the other day,
[20:56] Jesus, will you do this? Well, it's time
[20:58] for us to do something on our own.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; It's time for us if we're the if we're
[21:04] God made manifest in another form called
[21:05] the bride, we've got to trigger
[21:07] something to get us out of here.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Because normal will not get us out of
[21:13] here, brother Luis. Normal will never
[21:15] get you out of here. Normal has kept
[21:18] through us through the church ages.
[21:21] We've got to be what? Supernormal,
[21:23] supernatural.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; So expectation brings a reaction.
[21:28] Listen, Noah got up every day.
[21:31] If not, he lost his faith. Noah got up
[21:34] every day for 120 years and expected
[21:37] rain to fall.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Guess what? It did.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Abraham got up every day expecting that
[21:44] baby.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; One day it did.
[21:50] Simeon,
[21:52] old blind Simeon. He sat in that temple
[21:55] for years, but God had told him, "You
[21:58] will not die." He wasn't blind and was
[22:00] and was blind. He said, "You will not
[22:02] die till you see the Lord's Christ."
[22:04] Every day Simeon got up. See, are we
[22:06] doing the same thing? That's my problem
[22:07] I have with a lot of us, all of us. Are
[22:10] we getting up every day expecting for
[22:12] there be a change beginning in our body?
[22:15] a change beginning in even in our lives.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Simeon got up every day in that temple,
[22:23] walked up, and I'm sure the temple was
[22:26] full of babies being circumcised every
[22:29] day cuz it was on the eighth day and
[22:31] they weren't all born on the same day.
[22:32] So, they were there every day. There was
[22:34] a line of babies
[22:35] &gt;&gt; to be circumcised.
[22:37] But one day, Simeon got up expecting to
[22:41] see the Lord's Christ. Guess what? He
[22:43] did. That's right.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So, are we expecting a body change or we
[22:48] expecting to go out of here without it?
[22:50] &gt;&gt; I don't think we going to know. We're
[22:52] being changed right now the other
[22:54] direction.
[22:56] We've got aches and pains and and no
[22:59] hair and hair where it shouldn't be and
[23:01] all that other stuff.
[23:04] But listen,
[23:06] you get what you expect.
[23:09] If your expectation is to continue to be
[23:12] where you're at, then you know what?
[23:14] God's a gentleman. He'll allow you to
[23:17] stay right where you're at.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; But you will not get the full benefit of
[23:22] this age.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; We should get up every day expecting a
[23:30] resurrection.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Every day. Amen.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; No, it didn't miss a day or then he
[23:36] would have he would have he would have
[23:38] Listen, how many times have we said,
[23:39] "Well, we'll do this. We'll do this.
[23:41] We'll do this." And then about the 10th
[23:42] time we're we'll just kind of lose that
[23:44] and it'll go off.
[23:46] Well, I'm sorry. I'm the only human in
[23:48] this building
[23:50] &gt;&gt; and you'll kind of just drift off and
[23:52] No. Noah had to get up every day
[23:54] believing it was going to rain
[23:55] &gt;&gt; or he would have lost his faith.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Same way with Abraham. They did not look
[23:58] at the circumstances.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; They looked to the what? They looked to
[24:01] the promise, the expectation of the
[24:04] promise. Well, our expectation was when
[24:07] that angel came, mighty angel came down
[24:10] with a book in his hand, the little
[24:11] book. He was delivering that book to
[24:15] John. WE KNOW THAT. BUT REMEMBER, when
[24:17] brother Ram stood there, he was
[24:19] delivering the book, but he was the only
[24:20] one who knew what was going on.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; But it was for another generation that's
[24:25] going to pick this thing up and take it
[24:27] on to the coming of the Lord. take it on
[24:29] and be go deeper into God.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can preach sermons and make
[24:34] people cry. What Brother Brown said, Dr.
[24:36] Davis said said, "Brother Brown, Brother
[24:38] Brown said they cried." He said, "I
[24:40] cried. They cried." Dr. David said
[24:43] people cry at funerals, too.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; So, remember, Brother Brown started out
[24:49] with a little bit of criticism. He
[24:51] didn't start out preaching like a house
[24:52] on fire in a windy day. He started out
[24:54] very humble. That's right.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; But what are we expecting? Are we
[24:59] expecting to hear something for God? Are
[25:01] we expecting to hear just another
[25:03] sermon,
[25:04] &gt;&gt; come to church? When are we going to
[25:07] when we going to get out?
[25:13] &gt;&gt; You get what you expect.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Even thus shall it be in the day when
[25:18] the son of man is revealed. And we
[25:20] understand today that scripture has been
[25:23] fulfilled in your ears.
[25:26] Just as Jesus stood sat there in Luke
[25:28] with that scroll in his hand, he closed
[25:30] that scroll. He handed it to the to the
[25:32] U priest and he said, "This day, this
[25:35] scripture is fulfilled in your ears."
[25:38] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe him. That's
[25:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; No, they didn't believe him. But today,
[25:43] the son of man is going to be revealed.
[25:44] Somebody's going to believe that they're
[25:47] the last one.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; They're going to believe that this is
[25:51] it. There's nothing else. We can spend
[25:54] our time doing other things if we want
[25:55] to, but this is what's going to take us
[25:58] in a body change. Do not, excuse me, do
[26:01] not get it confused with anything else.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Luke 3:15.
[26:12] Now, what were they? What were the
[26:13] people expecting? They saw John the
[26:16] Baptist. They thought said, "Are you
[26:18] Christ?"
[26:21] John did not do one miracle.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; There was no sign that he was a prophet.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. He wasn't let have a healing
[26:33] campaign. He had one job. Introduce the
[26:35] Messiah. And when he stood there that
[26:37] day and he said, "Behold the lamb of God
[26:39] that takes away the sin of the world."
[26:41] His message was over.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I must do as John. I
[26:48] must decrease so that he can increase.
[26:51] That's why brother Ram had to leave the
[26:52] scene cuz he couldn't at at that point
[26:56] it was increasing in him. Now he's
[26:57] increasing in me and you.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; It's a many membered body that's going
[27:01] to get out of here.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[27:05] Luke 3:15. And as the people were in
[27:08] expectation,
[27:10] what is expectation? It's anxious and
[27:12] persistent are looking for something.
[27:15] You're anticipating something that's
[27:17] going to happen or you're expecting
[27:19] something is going to happen.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to expect every day now
[27:26] something's going to happen positive in
[27:28] the word of God. Now, it don't m mean
[27:29] that they have to have your hip replaced
[27:33] &gt;&gt; tomorrow. Did you not decide to tell
[27:36] anybody about that?
[27:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't know a thing about it.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, then Okay. All right. Huh.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Well,
[27:45] Okay. Yeah, but you going to have
[27:48] titanium put in your body in just a few
[27:50] hours.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Well, we'll be we'll be
[27:54] there. Lord will be with you. But need
[27:58] to know about these things. So, but
[28:00] anyway, but it doesn't matter how old we
[28:03] get and how much we fall apart. That
[28:05] means nothing.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Look at Abraham. He fell apart every
[28:10] day.
[28:12] None of you in this room are 99 yet.
[28:15] Well, except one.
[28:20] None of you are.
[28:22] Abraham expected every day to get up and
[28:26] meet Melazdc and have that baby.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; And you know what God did? He honored
[28:33] his faith.
[28:35] Do we have enough faith
[28:38] to call God on the scene
[28:41] &gt;&gt; to call a resurrection?
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Not out of not out of somewhere
[28:46] denomination. I'm talking about right
[28:47] here.
[28:49] It's going to happen right here. It's
[28:50] not going to happen anywhere else. When
[28:51] I mean right here, I mean in the in the
[28:54] open word, the open book, the open
[28:56] revelation of the end time. That's when
[28:58] it's going to happen. You cannot, if
[29:00] you're expecting it to happen somewhere
[29:02] else, you need the new birth.
[29:05] Because a new birth, listen, anybody
[29:07] that has a new birth and you hear this
[29:09] message, you might have got it somewhere
[29:11] else. That's okay.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; But if you hear this message and it
[29:15] cross your path, you have got to come to
[29:18] it.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; You got to There's no way. That's why
[29:22] Brother Ram said, he said, "Talk to the
[29:24] people." He said, "If they don't accept
[29:27] it," he said, "Predestination's off."
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[29:31] &gt;&gt; You prove who you are.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:34] Romans 8:18. For I reckon that the
[29:36] sufferings of this present time are not
[29:38] worthy to be compared with the glory. We
[29:40] look which shall we revealed in us.
[29:44] Paul's dead.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Arinius is dead. Brother Brown's dead.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; They done their job.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; It's got TO BE REVEALED IN A LIVE
[29:56] PERSON.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; A living person.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to be revealed in us. for the
[30:02] earnest what expectation
[30:04] of the creature or the creation waiteth
[30:08] for the manifestation of the sons of
[30:10] God. That's what the world's calling for
[30:13] is for us to to come to a place to where
[30:16] as as brother Richard Wilson said a
[30:18] couple weeks ago,
[30:20] you like it or not,
[30:23] if the word's got to come through me,
[30:25] it's going to come through me. If the
[30:27] word's going to come through you, it'll
[30:29] come through you and it'll be
[30:30] vindicated.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; You just got to depend on that. I depend
[30:35] on that, too. Yes,
[30:36] &gt;&gt; sir.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; But let's don't depend on a man. Let's
[30:40] depend on the man.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So, what is it? Our
[30:44] expectation for the creature was made
[30:46] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[30:48] reason of him who has subjected the same
[30:51] in hope. And hope actually is translated
[30:54] as expectation.
[30:56] Everybody with me?
[30:58] &gt;&gt; You're expecting something. You're
[31:00] hoping something's going to happen. But
[31:02] now remember, we're not creatures of
[31:03] hope anymore. We're creatures of faith.
[31:07] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[31:09] for. Hope for. Expected for.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Expected
[31:18] to come to a place to where the devil
[31:21] won't know what to do with you.
[31:23] expected to come to a place to where the
[31:25] dead saints that are that are in a place
[31:27] of eternity, they're in a place of
[31:29] perfection. They're going to want to
[31:31] come back here.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; But they're not going to come back here
[31:35] with death reigning in our members.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a live group of people
[31:42] that says, "Death, where is your sting?
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Grave, where's your victory?" Oh,
[31:47] listen. I'm telling you, this weekend I
[31:49] it fired me up. Right.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; It takes it takes something sometimes to
[31:53] flip that switch.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; But what are we expecting?
[31:59] Well, I'm expecting You better expect
[32:01] one thing. Growth and resurrection.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; GROWTH AND RESURRECTION. THAT'S IT.
[32:07] GROWTH and resurrection. GROWTH AND
[32:10] RESURRECTION. WHAT ARE YOU SEARCHING
[32:12] FOR? Growth and resurrection.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; And the only way you grow, Brother Ram
[32:17] said, what? You become the word as you
[32:19] receive the word. Right.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; You become the word
[32:24] &gt;&gt; as you receive the word.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; So if you don't receive the word,
[32:30] &gt;&gt; you don't become it.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; If you receive something else, that's
[32:34] why the church, the church nominal
[32:37] receives a dogma. They can't receive the
[32:40] eternal.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; They may be given eternal life. I'm
[32:44] talking about people that possess it
[32:45] right here today. Right here tonight.
[32:48] Right?
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Those people on the day of Pentecost,
[32:51] they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:52] in their soul and it made them
[32:54] different.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; It changed them.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And the same Holy Ghost inside of us is
[33:00] going to change us in a moment, in the
[33:02] twinkle of an eye.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; But it's going to be what you have taken
[33:06] in.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; So let's be just for a few minutes.
[33:14] Jesus went out and departed from the
[33:15] temple. I just want you to understand
[33:16] something. I'm expecting God to do
[33:19] something.
[33:21] And brother Brown said, "Ask for big
[33:23] things." So, I'm expecting something big
[33:25] to happen.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting something big to have.
[33:28] Listen, and this is what I told the
[33:30] people the other day at, Brother
[33:32] Richards. Do you know
[33:35] this is very simple?
[33:38] If you want a short sermon,
[33:42] Uh-huh. Oh, so you do want one.
[33:46] If you want a short sermon, you got to
[33:48] study.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Are you getting me?
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Because what a preacher does, he has to
[33:56] plow through what people don't
[33:58] understand. He has to come over here and
[34:00] spend 15 minutes and we do it anyway
[34:02] because that's what how we're made.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; There's some slow sheep and there's some
[34:08] fast sheep.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Okay? But it's one shepherd of that
[34:11] sheep.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, you got to kind of guide the
[34:14] guide the slow ones. Guide the slow ones
[34:18] &gt;&gt; and uh help them along.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; But if you'll listen, Brother B said,
[34:23] "How you get closer to God?" Study and
[34:24] read your Bible. If you'll study more
[34:26] and read your Bible more and come to
[34:28] church expecting more, you'll get a
[34:31] shorter sermon because I won't have to
[34:32] plow through all these avenues. Why do
[34:34] WHY DOES BROTHER WHY DOES Aaron and and
[34:37] Luis and myself, different ones, you'll
[34:39] be preaching away and you want to say
[34:40] this and all of a sudden you'll jump
[34:41] over that way.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Why?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; It's not cuz we wanted to. You know me,
[34:47] I go by my notes. But sometimes, like
[34:49] right now, I ain't on them.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going down a trail,
[34:55] but but I hope I'm coming back here in a
[34:57] second. But if you want a short sermon,
[35:00] you pray, you study, and you get some
[35:03] things for yourself.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Then guess what? I can come up here for
[35:09] 35 or 40 minutes and I can lay out what
[35:11] needs to be laid out and not have to go
[35:13] down a rabbit trail. Not have to listen.
[35:16] If everybody would come to church like
[35:17] they're supposed to, I wouldn't have to
[35:18] preach on it.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; I believe I will.
[35:28] I mean really,
[35:30] &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO COVER
[35:33] BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T DO IT. It's the
[35:35] slow sheep.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; I don't mind slow sheep. I'll go back
[35:42] and get anybody. But there's a time
[35:44] though when we've got to pick this up.
[35:46] Quit going around the mountain. Quit
[35:49] going the 40 years around and around. We
[35:51] got to go forward. And as Caleb said,
[35:53] give me my mountain. Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; You know, remind God. Say, "God, you
[35:58] promised me if I study and read my Bible
[36:01] that Brother Way will preach shorter."
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord, it will happen.
[36:07] I'm telling you, it will.
[36:09] All right. So, Jesus is he's going out.
[36:12] He he left and his disciples came to him
[36:15] for to show him the buildings of the
[36:16] temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See
[36:19] you not all these things? Verily I say
[36:21] unto you, there shall not one left here
[36:23] one stone upon another that shall not be
[36:26] thrown down. Now we know when that
[36:27] happened. That happened when Titus
[36:29] destroyed Israel in AD.70. All right?
[36:33] They turn they they knocked everything
[36:35] down. All right?
[36:39] And as he sat upon the mountain of
[36:41] olives, the disciples came unto him
[36:42] privately. So it was just them. It was
[36:44] just the 12. Judas was there.
[36:49] And as he sat on the Mount of Olives,
[36:50] the disciples came under him came unto
[36:52] him privately, saying, "Tell us, when
[36:54] shall these things be?" They were
[36:56] expecting something to happen. "And what
[36:58] shall be the sign of thy coming? We're
[37:00] expecting you to come and of the end of
[37:03] the world." We're expecting the end of
[37:05] the world. So, they were expecting
[37:06] something.
[37:08] So, Jesus, what does he do? He takes and
[37:10] he breaks down what's going to happen
[37:13] from the time he leaves.
[37:16] Come on. from the time he leaves ascends
[37:19] and comes back on the day of Pentecost
[37:20] because he said I'll go away but I'll
[37:22] come back from the day of Pentecost till
[37:25] today right now he told us in Matthew 24
[37:30] exactly what was going to happen
[37:32] &gt;&gt; right
[37:33] &gt;&gt; now we know that some of these things
[37:35] have not happened because the sixth seal
[37:37] is a tribulation seal so we're not going
[37:39] to but we are under that tribulation
[37:42] seal in ourself right now
[37:45] &gt;&gt; in oursel you saying, "Not out here."
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Do you think this is bad?
[37:51] &gt;&gt; You wait till the Holy Ghost lifts off
[37:52] of this earth.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; The only thing holding this place from
[37:57] going totally bonkers is me and you.
[37:59] That's right.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz God's not going to let this thing go
[38:02] wild until we get out of here.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; It might get close.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; The bomb may be almost touching the
[38:09] ground, but praise God, a prophet said
[38:11] there won't be no nuclear bomb hit the
[38:13] ground until we're out of here. So we
[38:15] may be going up as it comes down, but
[38:17] praise God, we know. We know what's
[38:20] going to happen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; See, our expectation of natural things
[38:24] have went on as we were talking this
[38:26] weekend. The Pope's already from the
[38:28] United States. So that's here.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; We're not expecting that to happen. We
[38:31] were. It's happening now. That's right.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; We've got a GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT
[38:37] CAN GO AND pluck
[38:39] a president
[38:41] of Venezuela is not much of a third
[38:43] world country. They're pretty powerful.
[38:45] THEY PLUCKED HIM OUT OF HIS BEDROOM
[38:48] &gt;&gt; WITH HIS WIFE, flew him to the United
[38:50] States, and nobody knew it for two days
[38:55] &gt;&gt; just because they had a little something
[38:56] against him. Don't tell me that ain't
[38:58] the beast beginning to speak. Right.
[39:01] Right.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram told us that gen that
[39:04] Revelations 13 was what? United States,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; right? And that that would be the image
[39:09] or the speaking for the beast. Well, we
[39:12] know the beast is already set up. We got
[39:13] a pope in the White House that's from
[39:15] America. All right.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; So, that's we know where that beast is
[39:18] coming from.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody with me?
[39:21] &gt;&gt; So, we know that.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; So, we know there's SOMEBODY IN POWER
[39:26] NOW that can make it speak.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Biden didn't even know what day it was.
[39:35] We got a guy that knows where every
[39:36] president's at any day of the week
[39:39] &gt;&gt; for the whole world. But remember,
[39:42] brother Brown said, "Watch Russia."
[39:46] &gt;&gt; The bear's just asleep.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Watch." Everybody's
[39:50] watching China now because China's got
[39:52] all this advancement. And we owe China
[39:54] several trillion dollars.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Several. like 35 trillion we owe China.
[40:00] They're going to actually bring that in
[40:02] one day and somebody's going to have to
[40:03] pay us off. We know he's going to pay us
[40:06] off because he's an American and him and
[40:09] the president's going to get together
[40:10] and they'll sign a treaty. But that
[40:12] treaty is signed, we're out of here.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; We're not going to see it, folks.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to see bad stuff, but you're
[40:18] not going to see that.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You're not going to see where they're
[40:21] going. They may have to run us down. We
[40:22] may have to hide in the cave for just a
[40:25] little while, but we're going to be
[40:26] ejected out of this place. But listen,
[40:28] is that what you're expecting? DON'T BE
[40:30] SCARED, CHILDREN. Don't be scared,
[40:32] adults. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE BUILT FOR.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; WE'RE BUILT FOR THIS.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; WE ARE PRESSURIZED.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD, THEY'RE GOING
[40:43] TOTALLY INSANE. THEY NEED AND and if you
[40:45] go to a psychiatrist, that's fine with
[40:47] me. If you take drugs for for for
[40:50] psychotic stuff, you do what you need to
[40:52] do. But I'm telling you, it's the devil
[40:54] of this age is making you that way.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And he's going to real hit hard on the
[41:02] believers.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; But listen, folks, get the new birth and
[41:08] trust that thing inside of you. It'll
[41:09] never tell you to put a gun to your
[41:11] head. It'll never tell you to do
[41:13] suicidal things. Never.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:17] I'm just warning you, it may get worse.
[41:19] I'm Well, I don't say it may. It will.
[41:21] I'm expecting it to get worse.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And you look at the stock market now,
[41:26] it's over 30,000.
[41:28] Eight years ago, it was 4,500.
[41:33] You see how much people are investing?
[41:35] They're putting their money
[41:37] into stocks and bonds.
[41:40] If we go bankrupt, folks, them people
[41:44] don't have no money.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; None. You think you safe?
[41:50] Your IRA
[41:53] will go out of the way in a blink of an
[41:57] eye. If this stock market crashes, which
[41:59] now it's at 30, if it crashes back down
[42:02] to even at the normal whatever it was,
[42:04] seven or 8,000,
[42:07] you'll lose your job.
[42:10] You can't buy or sell unless you got
[42:11] something to
[42:14] do with the church. Nominal.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; That's something we need to expect.
[42:21] But remember, we're the only people that
[42:24] have an expectation to be ejected out of
[42:26] the great tribulation.
[42:30] Paul said some of this, you know, this
[42:32] this light tribulation, I think he said,
[42:35] &gt;&gt; or light affliction.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; If he said light, sometimes we don't
[42:40] feel like it's light. I don't know if
[42:42] I'm going to get to this or not, but I'm
[42:43] just going to preach a little bit if
[42:44] that's okay.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; But light affliction.
[42:48] Sometimes we think, man, I can't stand
[42:49] this anymore. To God, that's light if
[42:52] you'll just look at him. Right.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's a light affliction that we
[42:57] have to go through because this world is
[43:00] you just
[43:02] Lord all you got to do is look at the
[43:04] newscast. You ain't got to look at no
[43:05] other program. Just look at the news
[43:08] &gt;&gt; how the craziness is going on. But
[43:09] listen, we already know that. So we
[43:11] shouldn't be nervous about this.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; We knew this like I said before when the
[43:17] pope was made come out of the United
[43:19] States bunch all message preachers they
[43:21] not all of them but a bunch of them
[43:22] started preaching ON IT. WHY? WE KNEW IT
[43:26] WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO SINK.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THIS NATION IS GOING TO BE
[43:33] absolutely obliterated.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; That wait a minute. That is if we
[43:38] believe Brother Brown was a prophet,
[43:40] &gt;&gt; which I do.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And I believe he was the voice of God
[43:43] for the end time. But now you and I are
[43:46] the final voice
[43:48] &gt;&gt; for the end time
[43:49] &gt;&gt; under our prophet messenger. So we
[43:51] listen to what he says.
[43:53] Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; So Jesus answered and said unto them, he
[43:58] said, "Take heed that no man deceive
[44:00] you." Now he's fix he's telling them
[44:01] what's going to happen.
[44:04] Cuz remember, I want you to look real
[44:06] quick. Six seals. Everybody with me?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Six seals finishes redemption.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; After the sixth seal is over, everything
[44:13] comes to a redemption.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me? Even the
[44:17] earth.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; But you're going through it now. Your
[44:21] sixth seal sanctification is going on
[44:23] right now.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Well, that was way ahead. That's six
[44:27] months from now when we get to the sixth
[44:29] seal. But that's what it is. It's a
[44:31] disruption of nature. Brother Ram said
[44:34] it was those two prophets which we won't
[44:36] be here during that time.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; But we listen remember when we go
[44:40] through these seals, there's two
[44:42] applications.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; There's a natural and there's a
[44:45] spiritual application.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; All right. The spiritual application now
[44:49] is Jesus is trying to tell them, "Take
[44:52] heed that no man deceive you."
[44:54] &gt;&gt; What did Paul preach right before he
[44:56] left? He said, "I I'm afraid that
[44:58] grievious wolves are going to come in."
[45:01] &gt;&gt; And and he even said, "And they're among
[45:03] us now."
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Didn't even wait till Paul died. They
[45:07] were among they were in the congregation
[45:09] as he was speaking.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the Listen, I'm sorry. He was
[45:15] under the son of God ministry. He
[45:17] couldn't discern that even come on
[45:19] &gt;&gt; even being a prophet.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; But he said he could look through a
[45:23] glass darkly. He could see something's
[45:24] going to happen. But no, NOT NOW, FOLKS.
[45:27] COME ON. WE GOT 2020 VISION. WE GOT 100
[45:30] VISION.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; We know what Paul was talking about.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; We know who IT'S COMING FROM, WHERE it's
[45:37] coming from. Jesus is telling us right
[45:39] now, take heed that no man deceive you.
[45:41] Paul wasn't there. He wasn't one of the
[45:43] disciples. By revelation, HE SAW EXACTLY
[45:47] WHAT Jesus saw,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; that no man deceive you.
[45:52] For many shall come in my name,
[45:57] SAYING, "I AM CHRIST," and shall deceive
[46:00] many. But now remember,
[46:03] through this whole series we're going
[46:05] through, the devil never is an
[46:08] originator.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; The devil never has a thought that God
[46:13] don't have.
[46:15] God's already knows. God already knows
[46:16] what the devil's thinking.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; If not, he's not God.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So, he knows what the devil's doing.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; But does THE DEVIL KNOW WHAT GOD'S
[46:26] DOING?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S HIDING HIMSELF IN ME AND YOU.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; IN A RAG TAG BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT THE
[46:33] WORLD SAYS, "WHY THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF
[46:35] man followers and women haters and they
[46:38] can't do this and they can't do that."
[46:40] If you feel depressed today, you need
[46:42] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; If you sisters can't put on a a fine
[46:47] dress and feel good about it,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach A LITTLE BIT. GOOD
[46:52] ABOUT IT. I MEAN, GOOD ABOUT IT. THAT
[46:54] YOU DON'T HAVE to cut your hair. That
[46:56] you don't wear makeup. Some of y'all
[46:58] ought to take that advice. Makeup is
[47:00] wrong.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't say that. Brother Ram said it.
[47:06] So, argue with him.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[47:12] Because the deception
[47:16] is now here.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; For many shall come in my name saying I
[47:21] am Christ and shall deceive many.
[47:26] Folks today right now 99% of the people
[47:29] in this world's deceived.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You prove it's not. Only the Holy Ghost
[47:38] fil people are not deceived. And brother
[47:40] Brown said, "Frankly, it would get them
[47:42] messed up because remember it says it
[47:43] wouldn't deceive the very elect if it
[47:44] were it would deceive us if it were
[47:46] possible." So, in other words, we're
[47:48] going to get right up to the edge of it
[47:50] some. Come on.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; But God's going to take us out of here
[47:54] before that happens.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; God's got this thing all worked out,
[47:59] man. We just got to get in the plan. I
[48:01] like what brother Steven Wilson said the
[48:02] other day. We were we were talking about
[48:04] Moses. You know, Brother Brandham on
[48:06] Christ the mystery of God revealed. He
[48:08] said God had a what? had a plan and a
[48:10] purpose and he was going to see it
[48:12] achieved. You know what Moses's problem
[48:14] the first time he was called? He didn't
[48:17] have a plan. He didn't have a purpose.
[48:19] He just had a dead Egyptian. He didn't
[48:21] know how to do it. He had to go to the
[48:23] back side of the desert. He had to meet
[48:25] God in a burning bush. THERE HE GOT HIS
[48:27] PLAN AND PURPOSE.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; So you and I, that's what BROTHER RAM
[48:30] SAID. WE'VE GOT TO MEET THAT SAME
[48:31] BURNING BUSH.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; It don't have to be a literal bush. It
[48:34] can be in your in your bedroom or in
[48:37] anywhere.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. IN YOUR PRAYER CLOSET. YOU got to
[48:40] meet that same God.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And when you MEET THAT SAME GOD, HE HAS
[48:45] A PLAN AND PURPOSE. And listen, ours is
[48:47] different than Luther.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Ours is different than Wesley. Ours is
[48:52] different than Pentecost.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Our plan and purpose is to take the FULL
[48:57] WORD OF GOD AND BECOME IT.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT, BECOME IT.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[49:06] Brother man said, 'Look. And I saw when
[49:08] he opened one of the seals, I heard it
[49:10] was a noise of thunder, saying, one of
[49:11] the beasts, saying, "Come and see." And
[49:14] I saw, and behold, a white horse, he
[49:16] that sat on him had a bow. Satan starts
[49:18] out with deception always. So, I'm
[49:21] telling you, anything we talk about this
[49:23] original, and I've heard people preach,
[49:25] and it's okay to say this, that the
[49:27] seals reveals the devil. I thought
[49:30] Brother Bram said the seals reveal Jesus
[49:31] Christ. Right?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; What it does is it exposes the devil.
[49:35] Tells you where he's at
[49:38] &gt;&gt; and what he's doing. Okay? Because he's
[49:40] NOT AN ORIGINATOR. GOD IS THE FIRST
[49:42] ALWAYS.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; He was the first white horse.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; He was the first one TO GET ON A WHITE
[49:50] HORSE.
[49:52] He was the first one TO HAVE A WHITE
[49:54] RIGHTEOUS CHURCH.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; You know, in the first church ages that
[49:58] on every corner almost there were
[50:00] message churches.
[50:03] There was no denomination.
[50:05] There were message churches everywhere.
[50:07] All over Asia, ALL OVER THAT WHERE PAUL
[50:09] WENT, there were message churches. Then
[50:12] they started dwindling and becoming
[50:13] something else and branching off and
[50:15] said, "Well, I don't think that's right.
[50:16] I'm going to go over there."
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And that caused a division and a
[50:21] denomination.
[50:24] And God is not in a denomination
[50:29] &gt;&gt; because when the lamb opened the seal,
[50:32] Satan had to leave.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Satan had to get on his white horse and
[50:38] ride off.
[50:40] But he still listen though, you still
[50:42] watch the deception though. Even though
[50:44] he got on his white horse, had a bow and
[50:46] no arrows, which was very deceiving. The
[50:48] Bible says a crown was given him. So
[50:51] they start calling him Lord.
[50:55] And he went forth conquering and to
[50:56] conquer. Who did he conquer?
[50:59] He didn't conquer the Christians. He
[51:00] conquered the leoty
[51:03] &gt;&gt; which was to make believers and
[51:04] unbelievers.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; The true believers just kept on doing
[51:08] what they were doing.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; That's why these seals are going to be I
[51:14] want you to understand these seals when
[51:15] we start they are to be personal to you.
[51:18] Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach on me and you.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Not that the white horse rider was
[51:23] Antichrist.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's false Christ everywhere.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; But there's a real real Christ. If
[51:31] you're the real Christ, you don't have
[51:32] to look anywhere else.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; If you got the Holy Ghost in your soul
[51:37] tonight, you don't have to look and find
[51:40] it somewhere else.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; You just need to get in the place where
[51:45] you can grow. And what? Grow. and
[51:48] resurrect. Grow and resurrect.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Because all babies are not gonna cause a
[51:56] resurrection.
[51:58] It'll take full grown individuals
[52:01] &gt;&gt; that know what to do with the word when
[52:04] God gives it to them.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. That's what
[52:09] I'm looking at.
[52:11] I'm looking at something to take a hold
[52:12] of all of us ministers all the way back
[52:14] to the back and change us in a moment in
[52:17] a twinkling of an eye. Change us from
[52:19] 2025 to 2026.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Keep that in your heart. Write it on
[52:27] your on your refrigerator. Expectation.
[52:31] What is your expectation?
[52:36] We'll come to church a lot better if
[52:38] we're expecting God to talk to us.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; And listen, I'm sorry,
[52:44] brother Anderson. I'm sorry, but this is
[52:46] the way God set it up. This is the plan
[52:48] and purpose of God is to take and give
[52:50] it to a five-fold ministry and they
[52:52] break it down to the people. That's just
[52:53] the way God said it was going to be
[52:55] because that's the Listen, are you with
[52:57] me?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; God saw that was the only way someone
[53:00] would be perfected. Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; God saw that's the only way or he'd have
[53:06] done it another way.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He don't have plans like us that we
[53:10] change it. He can't change his plan. So
[53:14] if we get into that blueprint, that
[53:15] plan, it will it will perfect somebody.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; But we got to go through this deception
[53:23] first.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't get quiet with me.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Satan's want to deceive you now.
[53:30] right now. Right now.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; But who did we find this fellow was?
[53:38] Brother Ram said Antichrist.
[53:42] So the revealing of Jesus Christ exposes
[53:44] the Antichrist.
[53:46] Because remember, Brother Bram says,
[53:48] "Here stands a lamb with a book in his
[53:49] hand." Well, here stands a lamb. Here
[53:51] stands the perfect one. Now, Brother
[53:53] Brham wasn't the perfect one, but he had
[53:55] the perfect word for the time. Everybody
[53:57] with me? He had the perfect word for the
[53:59] time. And when he had the perfect word
[54:01] for the time, Satan couldn't hide behind
[54:04] anything false doctrine
[54:08] &gt;&gt; anymore.
[54:12] Don't get quiet. Brother Brandham
[54:15] preached three years before that that
[54:16] the Holy Ghost was that person right
[54:19] there.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; I'll read it to you. I'll bring it to
[54:22] you when we start in the seals. and
[54:24] mighty conqueror. He said that white
[54:26] horse rider was Jesus Christ riding
[54:28] through the church ages.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; But now, not after that seal broke.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; When that seal broke, he said all the
[54:36] everything. He said, "Thank God for the
[54:39] opening of these seals." He could preach
[54:40] marriage and divorce. Thank God for the
[54:42] opening of the seals. He can see why I
[54:43] hated those denominations so bad.
[54:45] Because the opening of the seals, I can
[54:47] see that all doctrines are being
[54:48] straightened out.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. Because the son of
[54:52] man never ever ever ever ever ever
[54:54] preached a false doctrine.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And I know we have churches all over the
[55:00] place,
[55:01] but you can't have two or three opinions
[55:03] about this message.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; You better get into one
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and it not be an opinion.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; It be true and real. That's right.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz did Jesus say, "Well,
[55:22] I I sometimes I do what my daddy says,
[55:24] sometimes I don't."
[55:26] &gt;&gt; No. He said, "I only do that what the
[55:27] father shows me." Only only.
[55:32] See, he never had to come to a place
[55:34] when he was preaching the seals in
[55:35] Matthew 24. He never had to come to a
[55:37] place that guys, I was wrong.
[55:42] No, he was explaining to him exactly
[55:44] what the scripture says, even from the
[55:46] Old Testament
[55:48] &gt;&gt; till now.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz look, the deception was in the Old
[55:52] Testament just as much as it was in the
[55:54] New Testament.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; 2 Thessalonians 2. We may we may stop
[56:02] right here. I'll find I'll try to get to
[56:04] all these in a minute. Maybe next
[56:06] Wednesday.
[56:08] Now we beseech you, brethren, by the
[56:09] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by
[56:11] our gathering together unto him,
[56:13] gathering together, not apart, that you
[56:15] be not soon shaken in mind, or be
[56:17] troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
[56:19] word, nor by letter as from us, as that
[56:21] the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man
[56:25] deceive you by any means, for that day
[56:28] shall not come except there come a
[56:29] falling away first. Now, this is the
[56:32] first seal. Paul is telling us what's
[56:34] going on, all right? But he doesn't know
[56:36] it's a seal.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. He know he don't
[56:40] he didn't know the seals.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; He died before John wrote the book of
[56:43] Revelations.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. But listen, what he said in the
[56:47] 80% of the New Testament was what we
[56:50] need for the opening of the seals.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; But we needed brother Brandham's message
[56:54] to come and fill in and say this is if
[56:57] Paul preached this, I'm preaching the
[56:58] same thing.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means for
[57:04] that day shall not. Doesn't that make
[57:05] you happy though? YOU GOT PAUL. PAUL
[57:07] SAID, "YOU'LL be judged by by by my
[57:09] gospel that if an angel from heaven come
[57:12] and preach any other thing, let him be
[57:13] accursed."
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "I preached the
[57:16] same thing Paul preached."
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm here to tell you, he was saying
[57:21] the same thing. If an angel from heaven
[57:23] comes and preaches any other thing
[57:24] besides what the prophet of God
[57:25] preached, let them be accursed.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means, for
[57:31] that day shall not come, except there
[57:33] come a falling away first. And we see
[57:34] that already happening. And that man of
[57:37] sin be revealed, the son of predition,
[57:39] who opposes and exaltth himself above
[57:42] all that is called God. He's not worried
[57:44] about the world, po folks. No, HE'S NOT
[57:47] WORRIED ABOUT THE WORLD. He's worried
[57:49] and opposed TO THE ONES THAT ARE OF GOD.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Who opposes and exaltth himself ABOVE
[57:56] ALL THAT IS CALLED GOD.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Or that is worship. So that he as God
[58:03] siteth in the temple of God, church,
[58:07] showing himself that he is God. Remember
[58:09] you not that when I was yet with you, I
[58:12] told you these things. Now watch.
[58:15] And now you know, do we do we know what
[58:19] withholdeth that he might be revealed at
[58:22] his time?
[58:24] For the mystery of iniquity doth already
[58:26] work. Only who now letth will let
[58:29] brother R said that was God. He God leth
[58:32] will let till he the bride be taken out
[58:34] of the way. Now that's what he told us.
[58:36] I can't remember what sermon it was on
[58:37] but he told us exactly that's what that
[58:39] was. Then shall the wicked be revealed
[58:42] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[58:44] spirit of his mouth shall destroy with
[58:46] the brightness of his coming. Even him
[58:48] whose coming is after the workings of
[58:50] Satan. Look with all power signs and
[58:53] lying wonders.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[59:00] He's not finished.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; And with all deceivleness of
[59:04] unrighteousness in them that perish
[59:07] because they received not
[59:10] he didn't say just the truth have
[59:13] received not the love
[59:16] of the truth.
[59:19] You know
[59:21] let me give you a point then we'll
[59:23] close.
[59:25] And for this cause God shall send them
[59:27] strong delusion that they should believe
[59:28] a lie that they all might be damned who
[59:31] believeth not the truth but had pleasure
[59:33] in unrighteousness. Now talk about
[59:35] expectation
[59:37] just for a minute again. Let's get back
[59:39] to that.
[59:43] When you were um
[59:46] looking for a sweetheart
[59:50] and you kind of figured out June was the
[59:53] one.
[59:55] Well, my expectation got a lot different
[59:57] than it did the first time I met her.
[1:00:04] I'm going to sit here till somebody
[1:00:05] says, "Amen."
[1:00:08] Come on, people. Lord have mercy.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; You're lying if you don't say amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; But once you figured out
[1:00:20] she was the one
[1:00:22] and she figured out
[1:00:24] he's the one,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; didn't your expectation change?
[1:00:34] I mean, we went out the first time and I
[1:00:36] don't know where we went. Went
[1:00:37] somewhere. But, uh, the second time,
[1:00:41] whoa,
[1:00:43] it was different.
[1:00:46] Third time, y'all sit there like a bump
[1:00:48] on a pickle. I don't care.
[1:00:53] I'm telling you, this is the way it is
[1:00:54] with God. You didn't just start loving
[1:00:55] God the first time you you got even when
[1:00:57] you got saved.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; You didn't love God in the way you love
[1:01:01] him. Now, if you don't, you're not born
[1:01:02] again yet.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You know more about your mate now than
[1:01:06] you ever have known. That's why his wife
[1:01:09] has made herself ready, not the bride.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We have transformed. There's been a
[1:01:14] bride down through seven church ages
[1:01:16] that have known a little bit about who
[1:01:18] their lover is, known a little bit about
[1:01:19] who they're worshiping. Come on,
[1:01:20] somebody. But here in the end time,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; full disclosure,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Rebecca and Isaac go to the tent
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and Eleazar goes away.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; But Eleazar had a job to do.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He had to tell the bride. Come on,
[1:01:39] somebody. He had to tell the bride what
[1:01:42] Isaac looked like.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; He had to tell the bride what a Isaac
[1:01:46] act like, what he wore,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; his favorite meal. Yes.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BROWN CAME TO DO.
[1:01:55] AND THEN HE had to leave.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz Rebecca didn't jump off that camel
[1:02:02] and go running through the through the
[1:02:04] crowd. And where's Isaac? The Bible says
[1:02:07] she lighted.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; SHE LIGHTED OFF HER CAMEL. IN OTHER
[1:02:12] WORDS, she jumped
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; and WENT STRAIGHT TO ISAAC BECAUSE
[1:02:16] ELEAZAR had told her, "This is the way
[1:02:20] he looks. This is the way he acts. This
[1:02:23] is the way he talks. This is what he
[1:02:25] likes and this is what he don't like."
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S BROTHER BRANDHAM'S JOB. He had to
[1:02:29] lead the scene cuz he's not our Isaac.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; But he is our Eleas.
[1:02:35] We've never seen Jesus Christ in the
[1:02:37] flesh,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; but we are becoming him in the flesh in
[1:02:41] a many membered body.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; So, we're able to see Christ better, see
[1:02:46] Christ more
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; in each other.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's why the great falling away, we
[1:02:51] were talking about this weekend. The
[1:02:53] Bible says that there will come a time
[1:02:55] when a sinner will not be able to even
[1:02:57] sit in the congregation.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; He'll be so condemned, he'll either get
[1:03:02] the new birth or he'll leave. Right?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; That's why you see people leaving.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, they tell you they got the new
[1:03:08] birth. They tell you they got this. But
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; if you leave the word, you've left God.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It ain't me. It ain't brother Luis or
[1:03:16] brother Aaron or this building.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; But you leave the word, you leave God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like the music. I don't
[1:03:22] like this. Brother Brown said, "The only
[1:03:23] reason you leave a church is because
[1:03:25] your pastor is not preaching the word."
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:30] Um, well, I mean, listen, we take every
[1:03:32] quote that we like,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; but the ones we don't like, we say,
[1:03:36] "Well, he didn't really mean that."
[1:03:39] Listen, if he was a prophet of one, he
[1:03:41] was a prophet of all.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And I'll take the whole all because all
[1:03:45] is what go is what going to get us out
[1:03:47] of here. That pleasure and
[1:03:48] unrighteousness. There's people sitting
[1:03:50] today that love the Lord
[1:03:55] and it's the devil. That's right.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you a secret. Brother Bam
[1:04:02] told us that.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Bible tells us
[1:04:06] they'll come into the last days and say,
[1:04:07] "Have I not preached a good sermon,
[1:04:10] Lord? Have I NOT CAST OUT DEVILS? I HAD
[1:04:14] prayer lines out the door,
[1:04:17] healings,
[1:04:19] miracles,
[1:04:21] manifestations."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, I don't deny that,
[1:04:28] but you never stopped long enough to
[1:04:32] know me.
[1:04:34] You want to go do all this and have all
[1:04:36] this, you know, popcorn and lightning
[1:04:37] and thunder and all that other stuff.
[1:04:39] Come on, somebody.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; He'll say, "Depart from me. I never knew
[1:04:43] you." Now, if you depart from God, you
[1:04:45] know where you're going?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You're going to hell.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; So, there'll be people
[1:04:52] that will stand up and do that in the
[1:04:53] end time.
[1:04:55] Preach the word of God like a lark, but
[1:04:57] be off one one. Listen, brother Dell
[1:05:00] told us many years ago, he said, and
[1:05:01] even I think even brother Brown said, he
[1:05:03] said, one word got them out of the out
[1:05:05] of the garden of Eden. He said, being
[1:05:06] off one word, one word is not going to
[1:05:08] get us back in. One word. You say, "Oh,
[1:05:11] well, you got your opinion." And this
[1:05:13] preacher preaches it this way and this.
[1:05:14] You got to discern what's right because
[1:05:16] there's only one right.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? There's not two rights. Remember
[1:05:22] what brother Ram told us? He said, "Now,
[1:05:23] if you have two people talking to each
[1:05:25] other," he said, "Now, one one can't be
[1:05:28] right and the other one wrong if you're
[1:05:30] talking about the word of God." He said,
[1:05:32] he said, "Either either that or you're
[1:05:34] both wrong."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; You know, you both opinion is wrong
[1:05:37] anyway.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, your opinion is what's killing
[1:05:40] you.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Your opinion is what's killing you.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; My opinion is what's killing me.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; But God don't have opinions.
[1:05:52] God has a quickening word. Listen to me,
[1:05:58] musicians. Come on.
[1:06:00] This comes straight from the mind of
[1:06:02] God.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; To a prophet with the mind of God that
[1:06:10] could go back into the back part of
[1:06:11] God's mind where nobody had ever been
[1:06:13] before.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; But remember, he didn't say, "I'm the
[1:06:18] only way and can go." He said, "Let's go
[1:06:20] back.
[1:06:22] Come on, let's go back into the mind of
[1:06:25] God and let's see exactly what he meant
[1:06:27] from the foundation of the world till
[1:06:29] today. Listen, if you really see this
[1:06:32] message, you'll you'll you'll absolutely
[1:06:34] be the most humble pe people in the
[1:06:36] world that God would give you something
[1:06:39] so special.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And then we just throw it here and throw
[1:06:42] it there and we come to church when we
[1:06:43] want to and do what we want to, read
[1:06:45] Bible when we want to.
[1:06:48] I like that new song that guy sings.
[1:06:50] He's the dust on the Bible. We got a new
[1:06:52] iPhone. Let's stand our feet.
[1:06:59] You love the Lord.
[1:07:01] He's good to us.
[1:07:03] He's given us a message of
[1:07:04] reconciliation
[1:07:06] to reconcile us not back to the world or
[1:07:10] not to a person but to Jesus Christ. The
[1:07:14] word of God. He's restoring us back as
[1:07:17] we speak. So, what is your expectation?
[1:07:20] Do you expect to get something from God
[1:07:23] or you expect just to be here another
[1:07:25] year?
[1:07:27] I'm expecting for us to be out of here
[1:07:32] and then we can preach it
[1:07:35] like it's already happening. But I
[1:07:38] believe it is. Brother sent me a message
[1:07:41] that one brother from Pakistan. He may
[1:07:43] be watching in because he does every
[1:07:44] once in a while. He said, he said, "Are
[1:07:47] is a rapture a one-time event?"
[1:07:52] I said, "Well," I said, "Um,
[1:07:54] it's a culmination of an event cuz your
[1:07:58] new birth, you once you get the new
[1:08:00] birth, you're raptured,
[1:08:02] right?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; You're just not physically gone.
[1:08:05] But there will be a physical carrying
[1:08:07] away or a catching away of the bride.
[1:08:10] But when you receive the new birth, that
[1:08:12] puts your soul in heavenly places."
[1:08:13] That's what Paul said.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Resurrected
[1:08:18] and raptured in your soul,
[1:08:22] waiting for this old guy to get out of
[1:08:25] the way.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And let the new man take over. The real
[1:08:29] you is going to take over because the
[1:08:31] real you is the only thing that's going
[1:08:32] to be raptured. I'll guarantee it. It'll
[1:08:35] be nobody. You won't be It will not be
[1:08:38] impersonated. Remember, Brother Bram
[1:08:39] said, what did he say? The third pull.
[1:08:41] It would not be impersonated. The first
[1:08:43] two were, but this last one will not be
[1:08:45] impersonated. Why? Cuz we don't just
[1:08:47] think we're God. We know we're God.
[1:08:50] WE'RE KNOW. WE KNOW WE'RE GOD MADE
[1:08:52] MANIFEST IN ANOTHER FORM. WE KNOW THAT
[1:08:54] THE bride is going to be made perfect by
[1:08:58] our ministry, not mine, but our
[1:08:59] ministry. You got to find somebody
[1:09:01] that'll preach you to a body change. Not
[1:09:04] to preach you to a feeling or how much
[1:09:06] you cry and and how much you just get
[1:09:08] redfaced. And that ain't got one thing
[1:09:10] to do with it, folks.
[1:09:12] It's a heart thing.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Now, you can REJOICE AFTERWARDS. NOT A
[1:09:17] PROBLEM. BUT SIGNS FOLLOW the believer.
[1:09:20] You got to be a believer first and then
[1:09:22] everything will follow behind you.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I wish to God, like Paul said, I wish to
[1:09:28] God everybody spoke in tongues. Is that
[1:09:30] what he said? He said, but now remember
[1:09:34] what did he say? I'd rather speak five
[1:09:35] words
[1:09:37] of God
[1:09:40] than just thousands of speaking in
[1:09:42] tongues. He said, I'd rather speak five
[1:09:43] words from God. So, look where he put
[1:09:46] his emphasis on the word of God. Sitting
[1:09:50] every day and listening, sitting every
[1:09:52] uh listening to tapes and reading
[1:09:54] reading our Bible. Listen, you do other
[1:09:56] things.
[1:10:00] If you got a ticket in your hand to go
[1:10:02] to the Super Bowl,
[1:10:04] you're an idiot for one, but you you
[1:10:07] spent $50,000 for a ticket to just go
[1:10:10] see somebody holler.
[1:10:13] But you're expecting, man, what an
[1:10:14] expectation. I'm going to get to go to
[1:10:16] Super Bowl.
[1:10:19] The Super Bowl is a drop in the bucket
[1:10:22] compared to what you're seeing tonight.
[1:10:24] Compared to what you're hearing and
[1:10:26] seeing through the ministry of the bride
[1:10:28] of Jesus Christ, there is no Super Bowl
[1:10:30] that's any better than this. There's
[1:10:33] nothing. Coke's not even it. This is it.
[1:10:36] This is it, folks. There's nothing else.
[1:10:38] What do you expect from this day
[1:10:40] forward? What are you expecting?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; You expecting to do God do great things?
[1:10:45] I am.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; You expecting God to do great things?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let's get together and let's
[1:10:51] plow the field and let's get ready for
[1:10:53] the coming of the Lord. I was last night
[1:10:55] I was praying. I said, God, I said, call
[1:10:59] the names. I'm calling the names of
[1:11:02] everybody that I knew come here one time
[1:11:06] before and has left.
[1:11:11] You think about it. You think of the
[1:11:13] people you have fellowship with, been
[1:11:15] with that have I'm not talking about
[1:11:17] leave. I'm talking about go out in the
[1:11:19] world and just throw the message out.
[1:11:24] You better make them dear to your heart
[1:11:27] cuz you may be the only thing that gets
[1:11:29] them there.
[1:11:32] So I want to make myself
[1:11:34] to where that my children will see
[1:11:36] Christ
[1:11:38] and you make yourself to where you ch
[1:11:41] your children can see Christ in you.
[1:11:44] Not take me to church and act like a
[1:11:46] take your babies, children to church and
[1:11:48] say, "Look at brother Wayade. You need
[1:11:50] to look at him. He's the one." No, you
[1:11:53] start at your house.
[1:11:55] You start where you live more than you
[1:11:56] live right here. You live in your home.
[1:11:59] Your children watch you more than
[1:12:01] anybody else. And if you slip up,
[1:12:04] they're the first ones that going to
[1:12:05] tell you.
[1:12:07] So, let's be let's be expecting though.
[1:12:09] When we get up in the morning, we're
[1:12:10] going to expect change in our life. Oh,
[1:12:14] what a change in my life when Jesus came
[1:12:16] into my heart.
[1:12:18] You believe that?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't know that, get it. It's
[1:12:24] here for you to get.
[1:12:27] Get that thing that'll make you hunger
[1:12:29] and thirst for righteousness, not for
[1:12:30] unrighteousness and unrighteous living
[1:12:32] and all the things that you used to do
[1:12:34] when somebody else resided in your soul.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:12:40] If you'll get the new birth with the new
[1:12:42] man, you'll change. I promise you that.
[1:12:45] Let's sing a song
[1:12:51] in me a clean
[1:12:55] heart.
[1:12:58] Oh God, is that your desire
[1:13:03] and renew a right spirit
[1:13:07] within me, oh Lord?
[1:13:11] Let that be our prayer.
[1:13:14] Create in me. The whole world is
[1:13:18] groaning and waiting for the
[1:13:19] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:13:22] The whole creation
[1:13:24] is waiting on us to come to a place that
[1:13:27] God can use us to speak through to bring
[1:13:30] this thing back to its right condition.
[1:13:33] It will not come any other way.
[1:13:38] Cast me not away
[1:13:42] from thy presence and soul.
[1:13:50] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:13:56] Do what? Restore unto me the joy.
[1:14:00] Restore
[1:14:02] unto me
[1:14:06] the joy of thy salvation
[1:14:13] and renew a right spirit. Sing it to
[1:14:16] him.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Create in me
[1:14:26] a clean heart.
[1:14:31] Oh God,
[1:14:34] that's your desire. And renew a right
[1:14:38] spirit
[1:14:40] within me.
[1:14:46] Create in me a clean
[1:14:51] heart.
[1:14:54] Oh God,
[1:14:59] and renew a right spirit
[1:15:03] within me.
[1:15:07] Oh Lord,
[1:15:10] cast me not away
[1:15:14] from thy presence,
[1:15:18] oh Lord.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, what about David?
[1:15:22] take not thy holy spirit from me. He was
[1:15:27] longing to be right,
[1:15:30] but he just couldn't get everything
[1:15:31] right cuz he didn't have the Holy
[1:15:33] Spirit. But he had a joy of salvation,
[1:15:37] the joy of thy salvation.
[1:15:44] and renew your rights here and within
[1:15:49] me.
[1:15:52] Boy, think of a man named David.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; He sang all these psalms and
[1:15:58] he looked like a man that was in
[1:16:00] torment, but but then you'd see where
[1:16:02] he'd be dancing.
[1:16:04] He'd be worshiping God cuz he got a
[1:16:07] revelation.
[1:16:09] Tonight,
[1:16:11] I pray that we have a revelation of who
[1:16:14] we are and what we're doing here
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; and that 2026 will be the year that we
[1:16:22] really let it out.
[1:16:25] And let's see what God has to do. He's
[1:16:28] wanting to do it more than we want to
[1:16:30] have it done.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But let's cry out for our loved ones.
[1:16:35] Let's cry out for the ones that are
[1:16:36] weward, ones that are backslid.
[1:16:40] Bring them into the fold
[1:16:47] of my salvation.
[1:16:50] Do what?
[1:16:52] And think not the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit.
[1:16:59] Let the Holy Spirit let him speak to you
[1:17:02] now.
[1:17:04] unto me
[1:17:07] the joy of thy salvation.
[1:17:12] Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:17:14] And renew a right spirit
[1:17:18] within me.
[1:17:21] Remember Saturday at 3:00 for the day of
[1:17:23] war to be with us and we'll have
[1:17:26] service, one service Sunday. uh remember
[1:17:28] the um the meal afterwards and I don't
[1:17:32] know who's coming but we we've uh told
[1:17:35] everybody we know about it. So just keep
[1:17:37] us in prayer and we appreciate your uh
[1:17:40] participation and we appreciate you as a
[1:17:43] church. Um, we look around and different
[1:17:48] different things going on in the world
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:52] going things going on in the message
[1:17:53] that at one time you'd never think it
[1:17:56] was going on, but it is already now. You
[1:18:00] know why? Grievous wolves, as Paul said,
[1:18:04] have broken in. But you you just just
[1:18:07] make sure you got the Holy Ghost in your
[1:18:10] soul.
[1:18:12] Make sure you cleaned out. Make sure
[1:18:15] that everything you do has a purpose
[1:18:18] toward God.
[1:18:21] Even your natural life. Hey, listen.
[1:18:26] If you're a born again believer, this is
[1:18:28] not make believe.
[1:18:30] I told them this weekend, I said, "Look,
[1:18:33] if some people that didn't know anything
[1:18:35] about this message, heard this sermon or
[1:18:37] the sermon I preached Sunday, they'd
[1:18:39] think we were crazy.
[1:18:42] saying the things that we say, the
[1:18:43] verbiage and the things that we know
[1:18:45] that's truth.
[1:18:47] It's foreign to them.
[1:18:49] Let's don't let that creep in and become
[1:18:51] foreign to us.
[1:18:54] Let's renew it every time we come. Let's
[1:18:56] renew our spirit, renew our drive,
[1:19:01] and take a little more time for God.
[1:19:04] And it'll be a whole the services will
[1:19:06] be much better if we all come in here
[1:19:09] prayed up and ready to go. and do what
[1:19:11] the prophet said. Come expecting
[1:19:15] come expecting something to happen.
[1:19:18] You love the Lord.
[1:19:21] Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly
[1:19:23] father, Lord, thank you so much. We
[1:19:26] appreciate Lord what you give us. We
[1:19:29] appreciate the building we have and the
[1:19:31] brothers and sisters that's in it. Lord,
[1:19:32] all the musicians,
[1:19:34] ministers, Lord, lay people. Father,
[1:19:37] thank you so much for them. Lord, I pray
[1:19:39] that you'd be with him and bless him. Be
[1:19:41] with us Saturday, Lord, as we congregate
[1:19:43] again to to hear our brother Daryl Ward,
[1:19:46] Lord, a wonderful, precious brother,
[1:19:47] Lord, that you've used mightily for
[1:19:49] many, many years. Lord, I pray that
[1:19:52] we'll all come to uh the place that you
[1:19:54] want us to be, Father, and that you'll
[1:19:56] give us a blessing, Lord. Just grant it
[1:19:58] tonight, Lord. That blessing will
[1:19:59] continue onto our homes, Father. And
[1:20:02] that we'll love you more today than we
[1:20:04] did yesterday, Lord. We pray that you'd
[1:20:06] bless the ones that are sick, Lord. that
[1:20:08] can't come and and the ones that are
[1:20:10] afflicted, Lord, with backsliding and
[1:20:12] all the different things. Lord, we we
[1:20:14] pray that you'd go to them now, Lord, as
[1:20:15] the Holy Spirit is moving in the
[1:20:17] building, Father. Lord, each one, Lord,
[1:20:20] we we have loved ones and different
[1:20:21] ones. We can send that anointing to
[1:20:23] those people, Father, and just pray for
[1:20:26] them. Call their name,
[1:20:28] Lord, you'll know what to do. You know
[1:20:30] what to do. And we pray that you'll do
[1:20:33] that, Father, in Jesus name we pray.
[1:20:35] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:20:40] I appreciate
[1:20:44] you.
[1:20:49] I love you.
