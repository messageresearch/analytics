expecting hearts Lord God that you'll come and move Among Us Lord Jesus Lord to give us what we have need of to strengthen Us in this hour Lord that we're living in I pray God that you'll give us a little encouragement right here in the middle of the week Lord and God be with us tonight we pray in your name amen God bless you we're going to read tonight from Jonah chapter 1 and just little take a little topic about um Jonah as well and uh that that was nice that was nostalgic to come from the back I like I like that I enjoy it back we had a good time in in uh Tennessee the last weekend U good to see all the saints brother Cas brother brother kain's church and uh they send their greetings of course um so Jonah chapter 1 verse4 and then we'll read um I think it's verse 17 Jonah uh verse four says but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken and then verse 17 says now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights God bless you you can be seated the Lord has blessings to the reading of the word so you know uh uh just these are some interesting things to meditate on how God gave Jonah a big a big old fish and of course you know in another scripture says it was a whale and you think about what a horrible thing that would be to be thrown out of a boat and amen and to be uh uh they they they call that the fear of the deep that thalassophobia or whatever where you look down on the deep and you can't see the bottom and it's just a bunch of bubbles coming up and you look and you see nothing but just a big old great mouth coming up at you amen and um and you think that sometimes that God in in in our life he will allow uh you know we don't we don't get swallowed up by wh naturally but you still go through that's right brother times and things where you get swallowed up by uh circumstances and things and God allows you to get put into a place that begins to move you to where you are supposed to go I remember when I was first seeking the Lord I uh years ago you know you you get into a place where you're like oh God I I got to have I something's got to happen and God begins to it's like you're getting swall followed up by something and now you look you look at uh really I I I I did the AI thing I asked chat GPT what would it be like to be swallowed by a whale and and I just want to read you some of these things you know um it this isn't Doctrine or anything but just it said it would it kind of gave a nice little story that you know one moment Jonah would be thrashing amid crashing waves desperately gasping for breath and then suddenly everything goes dark and Silent as a massive Force Yanks him downward now you you think about the that that Jonah in this case would be like a little like bait and he's here comes here comes the big thing and it grabs him and starts pulling him down in other words what we're describing here is a nightmare he'd be tumbled through a slick tunnel of muscle and water unable to tell up from down in the terror of the those few seconds there's no time to rationalize only to feel the suffocating press of a living creature enveloping him all light disappears Jonah is engulfed in total darkness with no sense of space except the rhythmic squeezing of the fishes enters the walls around him are slimy pulsating with the heartbeat and breath of the creature every few seconds the fish's body shifts pressing him from one side than another imagine the pungent stench of decaying seaweed raw fish guts and stomach acid magnified a thousand times it's an unrelenting assault on the senses like standing in a fish market dumpster on a hot day but far worse the accurate sour smell of digested digestive juices would cling to Jonah's clothes and skin burning his nostrils and throat whenever he inhaled the air is heavy with moisture and wreaking of bow breathing feels labored as if no fresh oxygen can reach his lungs Jonah would probably be panning desperate not to inhale too deeply for fear of gagging on the stench or choking on stomach fluids panic and the confined space only make it worse in Jonah chapter 2 he mentions that seaweed was wrapped around his head so slippery strands of kelp or seaweed might have coiled around his body clinging to his arms and legs his skin would constantly encounter acidic fluids causing itching burning or rawness especially if the fish's stomach started to break things down and fish and whales are warm-blooded or at least they maintain internal temperature different from the Open Sea so inside it's probably going to be humid and and really warm enough to make Jonah just keep sweating and sweating and adding to the sense of claustrophobia and the fish should keep swimming down into the Sea's depths which means Jonah would be constantly buffeted back and forth sometimes feeling weightless other times pinned against the stomach lining and every time the fish gulps water or shifts Direction the Eternal internal pressure changes so Jonah is going to feel sosing liquids around his ankles or even up to his chest at times so he likely felt a gripping Primal Fear the impossibility of the situation still alive but confined in a monstrous creature would trigger claustrophobic dread rapid heartbeat frantic thoughts gasping sobs the very real question is how can I survive even another moment now that's why Jonah in Chapter 2 he said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice for thou has cast me cast me into the deep and the midst of the Seas and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me when my soul fainted within me I remember the Lord and my prayer came in and into the into thine Holy Temple now you see what what God had really put Jonah into he put him into a little prison and he would actually describe that it felt like that all the Earth all around him was just like the bars of the earth were around him and Jonah's there in the in the in the belly of this fish and the the uh the ribs of this fish actually become Jonah's prison and what it's do is it's is actually setting Jonah up so that well he he he got to go where God want him to go and where he doesn't want to go you know what what this story I I think so many I've been reading that story identification and there's and brother random in that in that sermon he he just talks about character that whole story is about character and and you read so many other stories like uh God is identified by his characteristics and just on and on that really the whole gospel really is almost about it's building up our character that God wants to see our character and you know we've we we we hear the word and we take in the word and and and we'll have the doctrine and whatnot but then what does the doctrine do it actually produces a character it produces a change in your life like that song we were just singing that the word the word that we've heard is is actually changing us so you can actually be known not even so much by the doctrine but by your fruits because your fruits is the character and the fruits is produced by the doctrine then when a man looks at you they can or a woman looks at you they can see the character that's been produced in You by the word of God that you've heard and I you know brother Brown would say a man's character is known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro or con that has nothing to do with it your Works tell what you are tells what you are inside every job that you do manifest what you are and and this story of Jonah I think is is unfolding all these characteristics of of of of who he is and and and who God is and brother an would say he we often prioritize external qualities outward appearances wealth or personal gain over internal character unlike God who values the heart God's looking at what kind of a character we are and what is your character as brother BR would explain in that message identification it's that inquality of who you are that creates like let's say you're like a little planet it creates an atmosphere right and when some people some you know people get around you they find out that your that your character is even it's either a nice atmosphere that they want to be around or it's a kind of atmosphere that that propels them away and they don't want to be around so you're either going to be forgiving and kind and honest and loyal and humble and patient or you're going to have the kind of characteristics that make people want to get away from you just like a planet just like a planet where you know the the the Earth is the third planet from the Sun and it's got life on it and you know you are you know on the moon you probably look down at Earth and and I I like that you know there's life and but look over at Mars or Jupiter and oh that's I I don't like it and so it creates an atmosphere and you create an atmosphere your character creates an atmosphere and what I'm getting at is Jonah had a character and this all these characters in the story had characteristics that that this story is actually unfolding as we look at you know that that well represent it's a type of death and living hell and and we we as we examine Jonah's character we might wonder well how how'd you end up in a wh's belly brother Brandon would say Jonah wasn't backsliding we always talk so much about Jonah being backsliding and everything he said I've always took up for Jonah I do not believe that Jonah was backslid but Jonah was righteous and what that means is that Jonah steps because he was righteous everything that he did was actually ordered by God now that's that's the that's the thing we start thinking sometimes when things go bad and we start getting squeezed by life and get into a bad spot we start thinking well well things go go back like that sermon brother R preach be certain of God and if you've done everything right and if you prayed up and you and you've you've repented and and and and everything's lined up right then you can trust and be confident that everything is ordered exactly the way that God wants things to go now now isn't that a comfort tonight to know that God is mindful of you he's mindful of your situation and your foots are footsteps are just as ordered as Abraham's footsteps were that everywhere Abraham took a step that his feet were ordered that he uh he took possession of the land and and just in that same way that's where in Psalm 37 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Del lith in his way brother random said and behold a greater than Solomon is here he said Jonah was the prophet many people condemn Jonah and say well he was an old backslider he wasn't backslid the steps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord so if God is on your side there is nothing out of cater amen there's nothing out of cater Jonah was called to Nineveh but he was supposed to go to Tarsus Now isn't that interesting thing that that the whole story actually is ordered exactly the way that God wanted it to unfold that he called him to go to Nineveh but but he went to Tarsus but God wanted him to go to Nineveh and he was supposed to go to Tarsus what a what a strange thing supposed to head towards Tarsus we'll say he's supposed to head over that way because the whole story has got to unfold in the way that God wants it to unfold that's why you know we were studying in First Corinthians that that judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God I think you know as that story of Jonah unfolds it actually manifests the character of Jonah it's manifesting the characteristics of the people on the boat it's manifesting the characteristics of the people in Nineveh as the story unfolds it's actually manifesting character did do you realize that ASO the closer we get to the coming of the Lord as as as the seals are revealed and it's just a side effect that you're going things are mysterious things are suddenly going to become known in other words things that were hidden for a long time well all of a sudden it's in plain view secret thoughts are being revealed secret characteristics are being manifested in Luke chapter 8 Jesus talked about how that no man when he ha lighted a candle coverthe with a vessel put putteth it under a bed but settle Seth it on a Candlestick that they which enter in may see the light for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad now Jesus is talking in a two-fold manner there he's talking in one place that the word the mysteries of the word are going to be revealed they're eventually going to be revealed but he's also talking about what about the mysteries of Our Lives what about the secret things that we do that we think that we're getting away with that things that are done in in Hidden and secret and and whatnot eventually eventually it's all going to come to light oh oh I I you know I I'd rather get things just get things out in the open you know we sometimes we'll we'll the Mist M we make so many times is we just sweep things under the rug and we think it's going to take care of itself and years later we find out that it you know the things that we left unresolved are still unresolved and we still got the same problems so let's take all those things that we swept up under the rug and lift lift up that corner of the rug and get it out in the open where everybody so the light can shine on it you know under the under the rug is where all them dead cockroaches and stuff are under the rug is where all the little pill bugs and things are the pull that rug and let the light shine on it and then let everything let everything be right there in the open now that's what Proverbs 28 says he that cover his sin shall not Prosper but who so confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy and Isaiah 29 says woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth Us Now isn't that isn't that just a human condition who who sees what I'm thinking about in private who sees that that website that I'm looking at when everybody thinks I'm just a goody too Christian and who sees who sees all of my hidden things but it's going to be revealed sooner or later and what what's being revealed God is actually allowing our character to manifest you know brother R preached that sermon the Masterpiece that talks about that after God built up this masterpiece over time by the word down Through the Ages eventually it's he he takes the cover off of it and it's revealed what he's been working on all the time now see as he in this age that we're living in this is the age of revealing this is the manifesting time that the cover has been pulled completely off the word so there's no there's no Darkness everything's been completely revealed from the Genesis to re to Revelation the cover has been pulled off of the Bride the cover has been pulled off of Christ the cover has been pulled off of the devil what that's what the seals do is they reveal all the secret hidden tactics of the enemy and and everything has been being revealed and what's what is it it's it's all the character our character is being revealed our character who we are is being revealed the character of Jonah the character of Nineveh the character of those men on the boat and the character of God how how does God act in this situation and you know you look at you look at Jonah's character going to tarus seems completely contrary to personal ambition you know God Deliver Us from ambition you know what ambition is ambition is like you got you know when I'm at work it's like everybody that I get on those conference calls we they all got ambition and I'm I'm I just I just want to provide for my family y'all they they got they they want to give up their life and their freedom and their Liberty work work 12 15 hours a day and and and and and and because they they've got such lofty lofty career goals that they want to they want to achieve something in this life or or you know ambition could be personal personal growth you want to be a better version of yourself so now you know there's a lot of things you can do at at the self-help section of the bookstore to make yourself better but the Bible says that you can't make yourself taller by adding one thought you can't increase one stature of yourself it takes the word of God to change you and to give you real personal growth so we can have all these Ambitions of things and it won't actually come to to to anything and what is ambition it's our self-will you see what I'm talking about tonight is I'm talking about when God calls a man when God calls you to the new birth or when God calls you to to to to walk with him or whatever God's calling you to do he can't use your ambition he can't use your self- will brother Ram said the greatest enemy that we have is ourselves that is when we feel like we can we feel when we feel we know when you feel like you know or you're the best or you're you're the best of all the rest or you're the one that's going to teach everybody else how to do something that God can't use any of that now now that's see that's the difference between calling and ambition Now isn't it odd though that many times God would C to somebody like Moses or somebody that in the 40 Years of wilderness or Paul running down to Egypt or or or Gideon and all these different characters and he would use that but he wouldn't use the big shot high priest or the different ones that that had all the worldly ambition and and college education and all those different kind of things what what what I'm getting at is our human abilities are secondary to divine intervention brother R said you must allow him to get you to that condition he cannot use you if he doesn't make you feel and know you're nothing that's right now that's what the whale is for and I'm so glad that God has given us whales in our life the whale the whale of circumstances to come along and feel like you're in your own little personal hell feel like you're in your own little personal nightmare that God can begin to mold you and set you on the path to where you're supposed to go to be but he said you you got to come to dust you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing and don't never rise above it for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God what's that saying down there where the dust is if you get above that and you're lofty and Ambitions or what you how you think things should be or how how great you think you are that then you have R actually risen above God and I preached on this so many times and I love to preach on it because I I I I just love to meditate on humility and and just getting as low as you can because brother R will say we can't do nothing without God but but the scripture says that with God I can do anything now there there's the the the balance is with myself with my own ambition and with all my own thoughts I I'm nothing I can't do anything but Philippians says I can do all three things through Christ which strengthened me so that means when you got a problem at work or you got a problem in your family or your problem in your home life with your own abilities and your own thought you will fail every time you can't do it you will fail every time but if you turn it over to God and and and turn it over to him in your prayer closet and get along with God and let God go to work and then it will always work out we can't do nothing without God but with God I can do anything he brother R would say who are you stick your finger in a bucket of water and pull it out and find the hole you put your finger in then say that was that was me you're nothing you'll not be missed after a little while after you're gone they'll have a funeral procession out here and that's all but what'll keep going on he said and this is a message influence he said but your influence will live on and on and on what what is that your character the impression that your character and your testimony made in life that's going to live on and on and on that people will remember the life that you lived for the gospel in the same way that they remember all that Hall of faith in Hebrews 11 they remember how people died and were sown aunder and gave their lives for the gospel because that's that character that's a testimony that Jesus is Alive and Well when we think we can do something in ourselves now I'm quoting brother Dale some things that brother Dale said cuz brother Dale said when we volunteer that's what CA brother Dale actually said that when we volunteer that is what causes so many problems when we're trying when we're taking our instead of our instead of God actually doing something when we take our own pride and our own ambition and our own vanity and say well I'm going to lift myself up and I'm going to go run and do it you you know that is actually what will make a young person in church that that they'll push p like a little old lady off the piano bench because they think that they can do it better that's what will make somebody some young person coming along in church that'll make them get out of the way you see that Pride am ambition vanity that's actually contrary to the real character that God is trying to produce in his bride pride and it lifted up you know brother R would say that Paul before his conversion he had ambition he had an ambition and he said to find out that this great ambition he had been trained for and had spent all of his life from maybe the age of about 8 or 10 years old up to about 30 or 35 when he finished college and graduated and had all of his diplomas and everything and stood in good with all the clergy even to the high priest at Jerusalem he had orders from him personal orders written and trusted with this great Saul to go down to Damascus and to find all those down there that worshiped God contrary to what he said and to bind them and put them in jail if necessary he had orders to put them de to death if he wanted to he had great ambition in other words he was convinced that he could do it and God cannot use a man that thinks he can do it Paul started out so excited at what he could do what he could accomplish and brother Ram would say now all that he had trained for God had took it all out of him you know to think that road to Damascus changed Paul before before he had all that ambition of himself but after he was changed to look at things differently that road to Damascus took away it took away his brother ra said it like this it took away his I can do it and you know what his Paul his ambition amounted to I I love the way that brother brand frames this up he said Paul's Ambitions it what he had his thumb on the saints of God having your thumb on somebody is like this it's old saying that they used to say in the 17th century that means that your thumb is so big and the person that your thumb is on so little that your thumb becomes this big giant thing that you can just push somebody down with and now that's what Paul's ambition became it was just something that he could just push somebody down with when he was changed he didn't want the world under his thumb anymore a man like that brother R said a man like that wouldn't put a Ministry or a world under his thumb he'd put under his master's thumb cuz he's not here representing himself he's representing his master now now isn't that just a beautiful way to think that we're not supposed to be under a man's thumb or a man's ideas but we're actually supposed to be under God's Thumb that not not under not under a man's ideas or under a man's control but under God's control amen and when God gets you under his control then now you're at liberty I I I you know I pray this is my prayer for myself and for the church that we'll never be under the thumb of a denomination system and never be under the thumb of man never be under the thumb of the devil where the devil's got you all HED and bound under the thumb never under the thumb of any man-made system but always have Liberty under the Master's thumb aren't you glad tonight that that's what the ministers that God has sent the fivefold ministry he didn't send us to put our thumb on people but to tell us what the master wants done so that God can have control and dominion over our life amen and the master called Jonah to go to Nineveh it said said now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh you know what's weird about that is is that Jonah didn't get any [Music] visitors now this is I I just meditating on the power of Revelation that he didn't get any phone calls he didn't get any letters he didn't have a big old Caravan of camels coming parading to his house to say that it's time to go to Nineveh and you know what Revelation is it's fundamentally the disclosure osure or unveiling of truth that is not derived from Human reasoning or intellect but is imparted by God Amen and Revelation is a process by which Divine truths are revealed to humans through spiritual Insight rather than through empirical evidence or study so in other words Revelation don't come from education you know I believe we're living in the day and the hour that that that that that is manifesting now where I just talking to different believers they talk about you know Ministry speaking that somebody's going to have a baby or you know uh turning turning around and and speaking a word of encouragement to somebody playing the piano and and what that is is you know Revelation is not just understanding the word of God but it's actually opening up a channel where God can speak to you and reveal things to you and tell you what you need to go what you need to do and where you need to go this is why in the Scripture it says the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth in other words that God can go speak to to a man and tell him what he needs to do that you need to go you need to go get baptized that you need to go and be born again that you need to go find a good church and speak to you and tell you what where where to get a good job or whatever and will actually guide you just like he told Abraham to get up and travel just like he'll tell a minister in a prayer line how to pray I know my own children have had so many testimonies of being in a prayer line and that Minister prayed exactly what my need was it got honed down exactly what I was seeking and and prayed exactly what I needed to hear Revelation told Philip to go to the Ethiopian church and revelation will give you revelation will give you not just understanding of the word but understanding of how to deal with situations in your life and with your family and and how to do so he got a visitation from God that revealed to him what he needed to do and John only goes as far away in the opposite direction I was listening to a sermon I think I think it was Aon mcgi that preached it and out in Arizona that he said he said this statement he said Jonah says not on your life not on your life I ain't going to them so he takes a ship to Tarsus and you would think now don't you just love to meditate on the word of God and meditate on like really really think about what is unfolding what a weird thing for a man to hear a direct revelation from God and then he not do it you would think that a man that received a direct message from God will be quick to fulfill it this this story is unfolding characteristics character right we find that just in the scripture just about anybody that was anything resisted the weight the weight of the calling because a calling is not ambition and it's not self-promotion but what what is a calling is a calling is a Divine summons in other words it's like that whale coming up out of the water say get over here and as much as Jonah resisted the whale's coming up and it's going to grab him and you know your calling is divinely revealed in the time that the Holy Ghost chooses so you can't make your calling manifest I I I hear so many times people come up somebody was asking me the other day I want to know what my calling is well there's the thing your calling is not just something that you really really want to do to the point that you're going to volunteer for it but I I I I tell you if God is truly calling a man or or calling anybody to do something there's going to be a storm and there's going to be a whale because those things follow your calling amen and that's why God gave us this story of Jonah to so that when you when you identify yourself in the scripture and can read these things about Isaiah and and Esther and all these things and then go read the story of Jonah and recognize your own story in this story and I'm talking about you amen I'm talking about remembering when you got into a place where you were desperate that God got you needed God to to do something amen and God was molding you and using circumstances and using the situation to bring you to a place like he brought Moses to a place Moses standing there at that burning bush well I can't talk I can't do all these things Elijah run into the cave a with all of that power to to speak fire out of heaven and Elijah run into a cave and and Jeremiah saying I I'm too young I can't speak I don't know how to speak for I'm only a youth and brother Dale I've got some quotes here brother Dale would say the call of God Burns so in your heart you can't rest day and night for it you just can't get away from it it's just constantly grinding at you he said in another place just let it come to its place but if it's not digging at you then let it come to its place he said brother Dale do you think I'd make a good preacher I'd said no don't think you would because I'm not let's just wait a while let's see what God says it about about it down the road somewhere if you volunteer for something you won't ever do it right now somebody was saying to me the other day that's a very confusing way to put that if you volunteer for it cuz that's your own ambition if you're rising up saying well here I go I'm I'm going to go do it then it it won't work right cuz a call is God's will not yours and it's probably going to have little if anything to do with your personal Ambitions look what brother Dell said you got to let it prove out you you got to let it work out to see if it's actually really God or not amen now I've seen I've seen that in my own life I'm I'm going to share some things that I've never shared before here when I when I was actually called of God I I believe I years ago I was I was I was in my little prayer closet and I was reading I believe it was the where Paul told Timothy to study to show thyself approved and and uh don't back up on me I know people think this kind of stuff is weird but I heard a voice that said study hard because one day you'll be preaching this and I held on to that in my in my little prayer closet and you know I didn't run around I haven't told anybody that ever except for my wife I didn't go running around telling everybody bless God I heard a direct Revelation from God which is what what most people I I'm sorry to say not trying to say nothing or whatever but many people would run around trying to make something but you see you got to wait until wait until what wait until the gift is ready recognized wait until other people can now this goes for anything if you you say you got a gift to play piano or whatnot and you're ready to go boot somebody out and ready to go change change the world and everything you wait until other people recognize that gift and the gift will actually open up the door and I you know I I I told the Lord when when when that happened I said if you want me to preach the gospel you have to put me behind the pulpit that's right amen cuz I ain't putting myself behind the pulpit amen and I remember years went by and one day I was standing outside and and and brother Wade said I'm going to have you teach Sunday school and it was like uh in that moment I could feel like a a light from Heaven Just Like Heaven open it up something is about to happen of course you you don't tell anybody you got to wait for things to unfold amen you just wait and you're and you're waiting for for you know hey maybe it just don't work out maybe I'm not that great or or whatever you know whatever you want to so you wait what are you waiting for others to recognize the gift amen then you I'm I'm talking about calling now see this is you you can't just run into something I remember years went by and and brother Terence would come over and say you know you got a call or whatever to be a minister or in different ones and and one day when I was called to preach I was standing up here serving communion with brother Wade and brother Dale was up here serving communion and he said we're going to have communion where these ministers serve communion and he said these words because we got to get brother Bob behind this pulpit and that is when I went out and I told Brother Dale okay I will here we go yeah in other words you got to it's a calling is different from your ambition you don't volunteer for it you don't run out and say well bless God I'm the one I'm the this all this kind of thing it you're a a calling is totally at odds from self-promotion now that's that's a lesson for that's a lesson for us all if you want to get anywhere in life whether you have a gift to play piano or gift to play guitar or a gift to sing in church you always put yourself like last you always put yourself the very lowest because a calling has nothing to do with ambition or Pride or your own self if anybody's going to be called or put somewhere by God is God going to be doing it and other words you you look at the story of Jonah self-promotion and self-elevation is always is always a sign of poor character right it's always a sign of poor character amen Proverbs 27 says let a another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips let let somebody else say that you're a good preacher or a good singer whatever because if it comes out of your mouth it just cheapens it in Luke chapter 18 he says I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be a based and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen you you know even to the point where self-promotion actually as soon as you promote yourself or lift yourself up boom you got Division if you want to know how to cause division or Schism start promoting yourself you promote yourself over your sibling at home well I'm the better guitar I'm the better driver I'm the better this or whatever and as soon as you start promoting yourself boom you're going to have a fight on your hands because self-promotion always causes Division and that's why you cannot lift yourself up amen amen you can't lift yourself up amen amen in Proverbs chapter 17 it says he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction to even lift up your gate you seek destruction it's James chapter 3 it says but if you Harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not boast about it or deny the truth for where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice Philippians chapter 2 says do nothing out of self selfish ambition or vain conceit rather in humility value others above yourselves and Galatians chapter 5 says the acts of the flesh are obvious selfish ambition dissensions factions those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God Proverbs Chapter 13 says where there is Strife there is pride I was talking to a deacon up in Ohio years ago about how that he he's managed many different Transitions and things and he's he's like you always you'll always have that one that's like I'm I'm the one I'm going to do it and then you always have ones that are trying kind of trying to get away from it and it's like the ones that lift themselves up and try to try to say I'm the best one for the job and are actually fulfilling that scripture in Luke chapter 14 that says if you're biding to a wedding sit not down in the highest room cuz cuz in other words the parable FS that eventually you're going to if you ain't supposed to be there you're going to eventually be doing the Walk of Shame you'll do the Walk of Shame back to where you go right and because that's what when when God is calling a man he isn't concerned with his natural abilities and worldly knowledge so here we find an example of all of us every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibilities we're all prone to do that we are more more prone to run than we are to stand and face it out we find ourselves running is what brother brandom said am running what from what from responsibility everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when the responsibilities face us to sh from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all manners even many times we find this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times Sher a responsibility for standing for the true word of God where can they're confronted with it they'll Sher that responsibility when truth of the word of God is brought face to face with we human beings we are prone to Sher back until the last resource what was Jonah running from running from that nation of Assyria you know Nineveh Nineveh was the at that time Nineveh was the largest city in the world Nineveh would be like that City in Los Angeles Nineveh was such a big city that sakaru came and he built these big huge things to to Plum the city where they had running water they had everything that they needed in that City and so Jonah is looking at that it'd be like going down in Los Angeles and preaching a sermon and walking through a city that was so big it was like three three days across to walk across that place and and and and and and so of course Jonah is looking at that thing fearing for his life he probably was afraid for life because what the Assyrians were known for their violence and mistreatment of foreigners in other words they were they were Lo known for lack of respect Jonas I think in one place brother said that Jonah was afraid the Assyrians just they just wouldn't listen to him or that his mission would succeed and another place even in Jonah chapter 4 it says Jonah wanted Justice I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God slow to anger and abounding in love a God who relents from ascending Calamity Jonah was Jonah was afraid to go down to that the largest city in the world the capital of the Assyrian Empire a powerful and brutal Nation known for its cruelty and warfare and oppression of other peoples afraid of all those murderers afraid of all the things that they were doing you know the process of Jonah running begin to manifest all these characteristics and Jonah and in verse three it says Jonah Rose to flee un tarus from the presence of the Lord cuz japa represented the easy way right and then uh we just keep going on I'm not I'm not going to stay long tonight but look when he got in that storm he got out on the boat on the way to japa the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship master came to him and said unto him what meanest thou Oh Sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not and they said everyone to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon Jonah you know you look at this scene unfold you can tell that God is always in control God is in control of the storm God is even looking at how how this scene unfolds they they're they're trying to figure out whose fault it is so they start casting lots did you never notice that casting lots actually stopped when they cast lots from AAS that's cuz once they got the new birth that's you got a direct line to God yes sir you're supposed to know what to do you don't need to throw a little bone on the floor and figure out which way is up which way is down and whether this bone is touching the other bone and all those kind of thing you don't need any gimmicks because the Holy Ghost gives you person a personal line with God he sent a storm to stop Jonah and you know the storm proved that he was God he was guiding Jonah to his will somebody was to blame for that store they were looking that's what they were looking for was somebody to blame you ever get in one of those situations like in your family you're trying to figure out who to blame whose fault is it and that's just that natural human inclination I got I got to figure out who to blame and this is another characteristic of Jonah is that Jonah ain't blaming nobody else when we get into a fix we're so quick to judge somebody else well you're the one you're the reason you're the this you're the that but Jonah was like I I'm the one right it it's so hard to recognize this is the The Human Condition it's so hard to recognize when we are the problem that's what God gave us the mirror of his word for when we hold up the word and we look at ourselves in the mirror then it exposes all of our faults and all of our failings and then we can begin to change and see things differently Jeremiah 17 it says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it it's like King David when he he he he uh did all what he did with bash Sheba and everything and he he just would not admit that he was the problem until Nathan the prophet came and pointed his finger at him and said you are the man gave him that Parable and you are the man that's it's so hard for us to admit when we're the one that's done something wrong amen they couldn't have peace until Jonah was on his way to Nineveh you know sometimes we're look at things the wrong way they weren't trying to get n of a Jonah cuz that's ambition but they were trying to get Jonah to Nineveh right that's a calling and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great Tempest is upon you and he threw up his hands and surrender brother R would say there's no way of getting out of it when God ever takes out after you you might you just might as well give up and go on that's that's all you know I wonder tonight if there's somebody here that God is after that they've been running and maybe they're in the belly of the whale of of of of Mind battles and and travail in their spirit and and and trying to get away from the thing that they know that they got to run to come it's time to jump out of the boat it's time to say well I'm the one I'm the I'm the reason why I'm in this pickle I I'm the reason while I'm in this situation and you know there's a real a real symptom of God calling you and God drawing you is that in your situation in your predicament well you're miserable you're you're miserable and you'll never be miserable free until you give in what God is trying to do and brother R would say he's after you you might Dodge over here and Dodge over there but you'll be miserable until you come back and do the thing you started out for him to do amen at the first place now there's a real symptom of calling is it it makes you miserable if you're called to preach and you don't preach then you're going to be miserable that's why brother Dell used to say years ago run run as long as you can run why to see if you're going to be miserable or if you're like I might as well do it I I think that I would be a great benefit and and then he said if you do that then you're going to cause so many problems now now think about that that a man that's not called might be able to do it okay but he's going to cause so many problems so many problems down the road so many hiccups so many challenges and in verse 17 of chapter 1 the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish 3 days and three nice surrounded by complete darkness no space to move or Escape cramped damp and filled with digestive fluids you know you know what that what that whale was it's a little clamp around Jonah now you've jumped out of the boat now I got you and you ain't going you ain't going to another palm tree covered place like you intended to do to do you are in the whale and I got you what is it's God's taxi service the whale is taking you exactly where you're supposed to go and what's the whale it's the it's misery it's torment it's like a little hell on Earth it's like all the anguish pretty pretty much everything terrible you could think of that we were describing lack of fresh air there's no air it's I'm sweating like crazy impressive heat constant motion of the fish sing right and his Disobedience had led him there and then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said by Cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the B belly of Hell cried I and thou heard my voice for thou Hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy ho Holy Temple you know Daniel Prayed toward the temple he threw open his windows and he prayed toward the temple and what does that symbolize it symbolizes is down in the belly of that well a realignment of your heart not to look at yourself not to look at your troubles but to begin looking toward God's word and now the Temple's been torn down over there in Israel and we don't turn our heart toward the physical Temple but we're to turning our heart toward God's promises and when God gets you into a predicament where where life is just squeezing in on you if you start align your heart towards God's toward God's word Orient yourself toward his promises what it represents a spiritual Direction and commitment to what to to I'm I'm now I'm going to do now I'm going to do what you want me to do amen what what prayer is more about the heart's posture toward God than your physical location anyway it don't matter whether you're in a belly the belly of a whale or whether you're up on top of a mountain but if if you Orient your heart that's what prayer is about and the Lord spake unto the fish as the musicians come and had vomited out Jonah upon the dry land and the word of the Lord came un Jonah the second time saying arise go unto Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose and went un Nineveh according to the word of the Lord and Jonah started to enter into the city a a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown and you know when Jonah I believe when Jonah's feet hit that sand he he didn't stop preaching until until the scripture says that their animals actually were repenting that they were putting sackcloth on their animals those people in that city were so moved by Jonah's message by his convicting preaching that their they repented and their household repented and their animals were covered in sackcloth and it changed that whole city because God Jonah yielded himself to God you know if you're called this morning or this evening as we stand to our feet you don't need lots to be cast to figure out what your situations in you know that you're the one that God wants amen you know what your situation is this afternoon tonight to think now that no one else can can feel your predestinated slot in life right if God's got something for you to do if God's got a song for you to sing in church or an instrument to play or something to do there's not one other person could fulfill that splot that's slot and you'll be miserable until you find your place brother Randa made this statement he said God was in the boat God was in the storm God was in the fish everywhere he turned God was there see God is there and it'll just keep haunting at you so why do we wait any longer why do we keep waiting I wonder if we bow our heads if you're tired of waiting won't you just lift your hand up to him say God remember me I'm tired of running I'm tired of trying to get away from you I want you I want your presence in my life I'm ready to orient myself towards your Holy Temple towards your word ready to set my thoughts set my desires in order to you Lord Jesus you see every hand raised tonight Lord Jesus Lord surely Lord God you recognize that we recognize our need for you we need you tonight Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll minister to every need every hand raised Lord God

Lord tonight you remember brother Ernie telling us about that story many many years ago preaching about Jonah yes sir said that they um they worshiped a naked man with no hair on him so when Jonah come flopping out of the whale all the acid had eat all his made his skin white and they said that's a God and then they started listening to him and he presented to him the God Amen and uh it's just a it's amazing how that um you know when you go fishing uh if you bass fish you watch when a bass strikes they're not liting they're sucking and it sucks that lure straight down through that little bitty hole it opens up and goes into his stomach and that's what happened to Jonah he got sucked in a hole and then all of a sudden he was dark and it was stinking and that's the way we are a lot of times but you know what he was right where God wanted him to be so that's just the whole the whole plan God had the whole plan worked out so let's give brother Bob a good good hand clap PR helps us and uh I can remember remember those times I know brother Bob was struggling some and U and then when uh when Dad said that yeah he kind of knew then it was it was time to start uh start ministering so we sure appreciate brother Bob and come a long way from uh being a little shy guy had a lot of black hair though and no beard I was watching some months ago one of his first sermons back in whatever it was 2013 or even before that and uh he look like Zach black you know just young kid but he sure come a long way a lot of wisdom we all gather wisdom from Brother Bob and we sure appreciate that uh I'm going to make this announcement again please sign up tonight if you're are your family is going to stay for pizza this Sunday this Sunday we're having worship service all the musicians and uh song leaders and if you have a song on your heart you want to practice that'll be the time to do it but we're going to have uh Pizza between service now if you're watching online uh send us a WhatsApp and tell us that you're coming uh if you're not coming don't worry about but if you are coming and send us a uh a message so we'll know how much pizza to get and um also we need to remember um brother Isaac I don't know if y'all remember me telling you last week and they're watching in tonight so they're they're seeing this but we need to really pray for our brother the devil's really knocking him in the head uh he's got um spinal fluid pretty much kind of leaking into is or or or U whatever that disc is is leaking fluid into his spine and causing numbness of his arms and his legs so he's not uh feeling well and so they're going to start streaming us on Wednesday nights he'll be still preaching on Sundays but he's having a real struggle so he's going to see the doctor I think maybe February the 7th or 8th before they come down here and so we want to uh uh lay hands on him tonight doesn't matter if he's 800 miles away we're going to lay hands on them and pray for him tonight and uh and pray that they all get here in a couple of weeks for the Valentine's banquet uh and again this thing that that uh June you know she put it on her everybody's table the other night or at watch night about the U doing something for charity work on a local level and then this Workshop popped up I saw it in the in the paper but I didn't say anything about it I didn't know if that was appropriate but it is the exact same thing that that when need to do from 8:30 to 4:00 in Gainesville and then let Joe Boyd or sister Jun know if you're interested in the workshop and it's something we can do for the community for and for our people um and we sure do appreciate and good news at noon has been around for a long time I knew Mr beckstein back when he first started it way back in the 80s early 80s and we would uh donate chicken and stuff to him and and um about middle 80s and we'd donate chicken to him for the uh good news at noon and he just he all he took was donations that's all he done he didn't he didn't u i mean they might have got some funding later on but most of it was volunteer work one of our um uh dentist Dr Ed Bernett he would go there and spend one whole day free service one whole day fixed his teeth and um and the people can't afford it they don't have a house we're going to go back to a warm house and some people don't have a warm house to go to because of many circumstances but I just like to pray tonight with for brother um Isaac if you will I know y'all are watching in if you'll um brothers and sisters won't youall gather together up there in in Ohio and and uh lay your hands on brother Isaac and um the devil's trying to stop him from the work and uh we're going to pray that that's going to reverse amen and that he'll come back and uh it sounds serious but to God it's not nothing serious that's right he's the great physician he we we going to H we're going to his book They're going to go to their books and then tell him he needs to do this and that and the other that this is this is the problem and the issue and may have to have surgery but Jesus performed surgery 2,000 years ago Lord he took care of every bit of that if we'll just believe brother R said if he was standing here tonight in the suit of clothes he couldn't heal you right and that's pretty powerful because you'd think man if Jesus was standing here in the suit of clothes he'd heal no it healed you at Calvary right all he' do is turn and look at you and say I've already done it that's right just believe what I've already done so let's let's pray for
