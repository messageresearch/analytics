[10:18] these things saith the amen the faithful
[10:20] and true witness the beginning of the
[10:21] creation of god
[10:24] i know thy works
[10:26] that are neither cold or hot
[10:29] i would thou art cold or hot
[10:31] so then because thy art lukewarm
[10:35] and neither cold or hot
[10:37] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[10:40] because thou saith i am rich
[10:43] and increase with goods
[10:45] and have need of nothing
[10:47] and know it's not that thou art wretched
[10:49] and miserable and poor and blind and
[10:52] naked
[10:53] now this is the age that we're living
[10:55] this is the time
[10:57] that we're living up on the earth all
[10:59] right you'll see i canceled thee to buy
[11:01] of me gold try to tried in the fire that
[11:04] thou mayest be rich in white raiment
[11:07] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[11:09] shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[11:12] and anoint thine eyes
[11:15] with eyesight
[11:17] that thou may see and as many as i love
[11:20] i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[11:22] therefore and repent
[11:24] behold i stand at the door knock if any
[11:27] man hear my voice and open the door i
[11:30] will come
[11:31] into him and will shut with him and he
[11:34] with me to him that overcometh
[11:37] will i grant to sit with me
[11:40] in my father's throne even as i also
[11:43] overcame and am set down with my father
[11:46] in his throne
[11:48] he that hath an ear
[11:50] let him hear what the spirit saith
[11:52] unto the churches you may be seated the
[11:54] lord had his blessing
[11:56] to the reading of the word
[12:02] now what i want to do is
[12:07] is to try to just talk to you more than
[12:10] to preach you know
[12:13] getting lifted up and everything i just
[12:15] want to talk to you a little bit today
[12:16] about something i believe is very very
[12:19] important
[12:20] for us to understand
[12:22] i believe that we're living
[12:26] in the time
[12:28] that we read here
[12:30] this is to the ladies in church age this
[12:33] is the the uh message coming to this age
[12:37] and see each age had a a message
[12:41] that a messenger they had a a move of
[12:44] god
[12:45] they had a rebuke they had a a praising
[12:50] each age has had the things in it to
[12:53] show and and and show where we're at
[12:57] all right
[12:58] and i believe that we're here at the end
[13:01] i i'm
[13:03] this is concerned about this as i can be
[13:05] about one thing to try to get you to see
[13:08] what i'm talking about
[13:10] i believe we're at the place that god is
[13:12] trying us
[13:17] i do i believe he's trying the little
[13:19] bride
[13:20] around the world not just lula not just
[13:22] this but trying the little bride
[13:25] he's putting us to a test to see what
[13:27] we're going to do
[13:28] all right i believe that that's as
[13:30] serious as i can be about it
[13:32] that's not derogatory
[13:34] that's not uh you know uh anything of
[13:37] any problems it's just i believe that
[13:40] god tried he's always tried his people
[13:45] he he knows how to raise children
[13:48] you know he knows how to bring children
[13:50] up and and raise them and and get them
[13:52] to to see and understand and the main
[13:55] thing that what in the bible is to me is
[13:59] that everywhere you look it's always god
[14:02] trying to come on the scene
[14:05] to his people no matter what age what
[14:07] time old testament new testament it's
[14:09] always been that he's trying to come on
[14:11] the scene
[14:13] to you and i for us to realize uh
[14:17] not only who he is
[14:19] you know but to realize who we are
[14:23] and see everybody should get to the
[14:25] point we've always tried to preach it
[14:27] the prophet preached a message one time
[14:29] but recognizing your day in this message
[14:32] all right see we believe that we're in
[14:34] the end time we believe here that god
[14:36] has to give us a message that brought it
[14:38] down through the prophet of the age and
[14:40] time
[14:41] we believe that and we believe that he
[14:43] has given us all of these things that
[14:46] go with that the message of the hour is
[14:49] here
[14:50] the things you know that we can know and
[14:53] recognize where we're at and what we're
[14:55] doing
[14:56] and can say glory hallelujah we realize
[14:59] that but that's the point i want you to
[15:00] see we need to realize
[15:05] more and more
[15:06] we
[15:07] we should emphasize i believe
[15:10] the knowing and realizing
[15:12] what's taking place
[15:16] and and seeing the day and the hour i
[15:19] mean you look out there and you see the
[15:21] things and and you realize what's taking
[15:24] place out there the world's falling
[15:27] apart it's you know nobody has any cures
[15:30] for all of these things it's not just a
[15:32] virus it's a it's a virus to the way i
[15:35] look at it it's a virus for the whole
[15:36] world
[15:37] it's not just a virus that i can't even
[15:41] pronounce the name that's why i call it
[15:43] a virus you know but
[15:45] it
[15:45] it's
[15:47] there for the whole world we've never
[15:50] had
[15:52] a time
[15:53] as far as we would know of or whatever
[15:55] to do that the entire world
[16:00] is on the brink of destruction
[16:03] not from
[16:04] bombs
[16:06] not from all of the things you know that
[16:08] you would see
[16:09] uh that we could do with but it's it's
[16:11] on the brink of destruction of its own
[16:14] self because it's falling inward it it
[16:17] it's collapsing
[16:19] it's doing all of the things and there's
[16:22] no cure for it
[16:25] you talk about no cure for the virus
[16:27] there's no cure for what is taking place
[16:29] today because you know i mean you put in
[16:32] another president and he does the best
[16:34] way he can and he didn't we don't like
[16:36] ad we put in another one we go up and
[16:38] down and and all kind of things trying
[16:41] to uh you know find a way
[16:44] to come forth with some answer
[16:47] well
[16:49] there is no answer the only answer is
[16:51] jesus christ and and the people are not
[16:53] going to go for that see
[16:56] the people are not going to to to jesus
[16:58] christ you say they're not going yeah
[17:00] they're going to church they're going to
[17:02] to all of the things they're trying to
[17:04] live and do and you know and all like
[17:07] that i'm not throwing off on the way
[17:09] people are doing because probably more
[17:11] people in church today than has been in
[17:14] a long time because you know the i hope
[17:17] it's back like it was uh
[17:20] you know
[17:21] in some of the other incidents where
[17:22] people started going to church
[17:25] you know
[17:26] and got more concerned got more more uh
[17:29] to where they could want to go to church
[17:31] but see my point is one thing you
[17:35] the whole message now will be based on
[17:38] one thing i believe god is trying his
[17:41] people
[17:43] he's putting us to a
[17:44] test to see what we'll do
[17:48] all right
[17:49] and see that way then you read
[17:52] the uh part of the age that we're living
[17:56] and you can read how that they're so
[17:58] horrible of things
[18:00] that are there in the the reading you
[18:03] know and all and and then
[18:05] then you find some good things
[18:08] because that's the way it is to each
[18:09] ages it's it's
[18:12] down on one side but then it picks up
[18:14] god never leaves his church
[18:17] and it's always to the overcomer
[18:20] amen the
[18:22] all right it's this is not to the world
[18:24] a world can listen and get as much
[18:26] benefit as they can from the the gospel
[18:29] and all but really the little bride of
[18:31] jesus christ is the only one that has
[18:34] the uh
[18:36] uh the
[18:38] promise
[18:40] you know i i i remind the lord like this
[18:44] you know you pray sometimes and
[18:46] and and i'm serious in the prayer part
[18:48] because i remind the lord that you
[18:51] promised it
[18:54] you know but now listen don't don't get
[18:56] tied up into all of that to you you can
[18:58] holler lord you promised it lord you
[19:00] promised it to so much until you're
[19:02] getting in trouble
[19:03] now
[19:04] my point is always this way when i say
[19:07] lord
[19:08] you promised this in your word
[19:10] that you would be with us
[19:13] that all of these things would come
[19:16] we would know the age we're living by
[19:18] what's coming and what's taking place
[19:21] and all i can but lord you promised to
[19:23] come on the scene
[19:26] all right now this is the way i'll end
[19:27] up that part of the prayer
[19:29] lord i'm not
[19:32] trying to get you to work out something
[19:35] or do what we want done
[19:39] i am praying for you to just to fulfill
[19:42] your word
[19:44] you promised it
[19:47] now i'm not trying to challenge you on
[19:49] the basis of trying to get you to do it
[19:52] because i know you will
[19:54] that's the point i want to get to we're
[19:56] going to get into a strange thing in a
[19:58] minute but we're going to look back down
[20:00] and we're going to see that god has done
[20:03] what he said he'd do
[20:07] he's done what he said he'd do
[20:10] he's brought it right to the to the
[20:11] point to where we're standing today
[20:15] and he's tried every age every people
[20:17] and their tribe of god see
[20:20] because
[20:21] you want your children to be uh good
[20:24] children
[20:25] you know
[20:26] uh and brother
[20:28] gary atkins used to say about
[20:30] sister orr she had this
[20:32] little
[20:33] thing that them boys would do wrong and
[20:35] she'd reach over and go wow
[20:37] you could hear it i mean you'd be
[20:38] preaching away and you'll hear them cry
[20:40] well
[20:41] they they got corrected he said now she
[20:44] knows how to
[20:45] make them line up you know well that's
[20:48] true and god knows how to make you and
[20:50] me come to the right place
[20:53] all right so now get the point of what
[20:54] we're aiming at
[20:56] god is trying his bride
[21:00] he's putting her to a test
[21:03] and the prophet said she would prove
[21:05] that she wouldn't
[21:06] fall like eve
[21:09] all right so now we're going to prove
[21:11] what we are amen
[21:13] okay
[21:14] and see now sickness can't come on
[21:19] the people of god
[21:21] unless god allows that
[21:23] to take place
[21:25] all right and then when he does it's for
[21:28] our benefit
[21:30] that the sickness comes you say oh
[21:32] that's not a good daddy
[21:35] that's a wonderful daddy
[21:37] because he knows how to train us
[21:40] he knows how to get us to the right
[21:41] place
[21:42] he knows when the the rod of correction
[21:44] needs to be made
[21:46] he said be the child it won't die now
[21:48] what about god putting in his own word
[21:50] of saying that
[21:52] he wasn't saying
[21:53] you know come out here and take him and
[21:55] just beat him to death and all that no
[21:57] he was just emphasizing
[22:00] the point of the interest of
[22:02] put on a little bit every once in a
[22:04] while uh wade one time i remember i was
[22:06] spanking him about something and he's
[22:08] about probably 18 years old you know
[22:11] and i spanking him well i hit him one
[22:13] time and you know
[22:15] and
[22:16] he just stood there
[22:19] well i
[22:21] put a little bit more to it the next
[22:22] time and i touched a little more and he
[22:25] just
[22:26] stood there
[22:28] i said okay now one thing or the other's
[22:31] got to happen
[22:32] i got to break this stick or break that
[22:34] kid
[22:36] so i came back and i put a pretty good
[22:39] one on there and when i did tears run
[22:40] down there i laid the stick down i
[22:42] didn't need to work no more
[22:44] but you see i had to make sure
[22:47] he understood had he been smart he would
[22:50] have been like gary said that his daddy
[22:52] would do him then mama would tell uh
[22:56] brother gary said his mama would would
[22:58] tell
[22:59] dr atkins they were great friends of
[23:01] ours and say you've got to whip gary
[23:05] because he's done so and so and so and
[23:07] so well he'd take him in the bedroom you
[23:09] know and sell his lay down across the
[23:11] bed and
[23:12] and he'd get a belt you know he'd reach
[23:14] over and he'd hit the bed and gary said
[23:17] i'd look at him and think what's he
[23:19] doing and he hit the bed he said gary
[23:21] gary
[23:22] holler
[23:24] holler
[23:25] you know
[23:26] in other words mike make another racquet
[23:29] till grandma think i'm in here whooping
[23:30] you
[23:31] well god don't have to do all of that
[23:33] but he knows how to handle it he knows
[23:36] how to put to put the fire on just a
[23:38] little bit you know a little fire when
[23:40] we need it okay so he's trying us
[23:43] to prove that we are the bride
[23:46] all right
[23:47] now i want to think about what we want
[23:50] to get with you about
[23:52] because this is we're talking to him
[23:54] that overcometh that'll be the the point
[23:57] of the message
[23:58] go
[24:00] each age and as i said
[24:02] they have their word
[24:05] they have their their message they have
[24:07] their trials they have their things and
[24:09] it all comes out to to be
[24:12] uh uh uh
[24:15] a part of
[24:17] well like we'd say in revelation 3 15
[24:19] there
[24:20] see you start out and it starts telling
[24:22] you the bad things
[24:25] all right
[24:27] real bad
[24:28] i canceled you to buy me you've done
[24:30] this you've done that it's a bad age you
[24:33] look out there and you see it you say
[24:35] well that's them no that's us
[24:38] let's don't never just put it all on
[24:39] somebody else and all let's get it into
[24:41] straight enough but yet when it comes to
[24:43] the end of the chapter it's praising the
[24:46] people
[24:47] and admonishing us to move on in god
[24:50] all right so that's the two things that
[24:52] we need to do first realize god will
[24:55] take care of it he will punish us he
[24:58] will mark us he'll he'll bring us to the
[25:00] right place
[25:02] we may not like it
[25:04] but he'll take care of it that's not
[25:06] meaning a dirty mean old daddy that
[25:09] means a wonderful
[25:11] loving father who knows how to take care
[25:13] of his children all right
[25:15] now
[25:18] thinking about that then we're
[25:20] recognizing that
[25:22] our day and its message
[25:25] seeing it right there in the scripture
[25:27] that we can like i said we can look out
[25:29] there and say this is them this is the
[25:32] world and we look over here and say well
[25:34] okay this is this is for us and all and
[25:37] that's all well and good
[25:39] because it'll bring us to a place
[25:41] to realize what we're doing
[25:44] see and you wind up saying to him that
[25:46] overcometh
[25:49] all right now it's not what we overcome
[25:54] it's how we overcome
[25:56] and how do we overcome
[25:58] by being in jesus christ
[26:00] and doing it his ways learning to know
[26:03] that our father has everything in charge
[26:07] he's putting us through to all of these
[26:09] things bringing us to ending it all up
[26:12] and to realize that we've got to see the
[26:14] message of the hour
[26:16] is the same thing this message was you
[26:19] know i mean you listen sometimes to what
[26:21] brother branham and boy he lays it down
[26:24] i mean he he don't play he he puts some
[26:26] hard words out there
[26:29] and things to show us where we're
[26:31] standing
[26:32] and to me then can you say amen
[26:36] and might you might have to say oh me to
[26:38] start with
[26:39] but once you realize what he's doing
[26:42] then you can start saying amen to what
[26:44] he's rebuking because you're seeing
[26:47] right where you're standing see all
[26:49] right so recognizing your message the
[26:52] hour because it's all going to wind up
[26:55] now
[26:56] and listen and then i'll get into the
[26:57] message it's all going to unfold
[27:01] to us if we'll just look at it correctly
[27:04] but he is not
[27:06] beating us
[27:09] you know
[27:12] doing all of those things that we think
[27:14] that he's trying to correct
[27:16] he's not doing that he's trying to guide
[27:18] us into the understanding of where we
[27:21] need to be
[27:23] all right
[27:24] because that's what the weapons are for
[27:26] that's what those things and it's to him
[27:28] that overcometh yes
[27:31] it's not what we overcome but how we how
[27:34] do we overcome by being in jesus christ
[27:37] all right he's the savior he's the doer
[27:40] of all things and and doing into that
[27:42] but now here's something i want you to
[27:44] think about
[27:47] because i want you to realize
[27:50] how
[27:50] perfect the word of god is
[27:54] let's just think about something that a
[27:56] prophet told us
[27:58] and then what i want you to think about
[28:00] and i want you to as we go through these
[28:02] things
[28:03] i want you to think about some of these
[28:05] things as way back
[28:08] some of them were happening right then
[28:11] some is still happening
[28:14] and i want you to get that point because
[28:16] that's what i want it to be i want you
[28:18] to see that god is directing us because
[28:22] he's telling us
[28:23] before it ever happens
[28:26] that's the wonderful part i think about
[28:27] the bible all the way through how
[28:29] wonderful it is to tell the future
[28:33] tell what's going to happen and then you
[28:35] can sit down and say you mean
[28:39] but that's what happened
[28:42] it's wonderful to think about and
[28:44] realize
[28:45] where you're at and you say well uh
[28:47] daddy told me so and so
[28:50] you know
[28:52] and then one day you see that come to
[28:53] pass talk about your natural daddy
[28:55] natural mother
[28:56] teachers et cetera you know uh
[29:00] he said they were they were telling me
[29:03] and i was living that
[29:06] do you realize
[29:08] no
[29:09] you started off with me so let's see how
[29:10] far you can go you started off with me
[29:13] of thinking about that
[29:15] god is trying us
[29:18] all right
[29:19] now if he's trying us then it proves one
[29:22] thing he loves us
[29:27] come on now children
[29:29] uh daddy mama has to spank you sometime
[29:35] but you know it's like i told the kids
[29:36] one day the boys they were sitting there
[29:38] and had to correct the kids or something
[29:40] and you know they they
[29:43] they looked over finally and said daddy
[29:45] now we know what you're talking about
[29:47] and
[29:48] because what i was talking about was one
[29:50] thing
[29:51] i'd always when i'd whip the kids i said
[29:53] look this go this hurts me worse than it
[29:54] does you
[29:57] that's hard to think about it
[30:00] i mean you take a belt and you just
[30:01] wearing somebody
[30:03] out real good you know and then you're
[30:05] telling them so this hurts me well they
[30:07] had to correct their children
[30:09] i said now do you realize what i was
[30:11] trying to say
[30:14] do you realize now what i was trying to
[30:16] say to you that that hurts me
[30:19] because you don't want to whoop the kid
[30:22] especially when they're standing there
[30:23] looking at you oh the miles you know
[30:26] puppy dog as we call it you know and and
[30:28] everything you just oh
[30:31] i'll do better next time
[30:34] say well
[30:36] you might have to start this time
[30:38] cause you know how now come on mama and
[30:40] daddy you know what i'm talking about
[30:43] you don't want to whip him children all
[30:44] the time
[30:46] you don't if you do there's something
[30:48] wrong with you
[30:49] if there's something you if it if it is
[30:51] if you're just wanting to whip them all
[30:52] the time or or beat them or show who's
[30:54] the boss
[30:56] then there's something wrong with you
[30:57] you're not lining up to to the way god
[31:00] raises his children
[31:02] god spanks his children yes but he does
[31:05] it with a hand of love
[31:07] you ever thought about being whipped
[31:09] with a hand
[31:11] that had a nail hole in it
[31:16] everything like that
[31:18] think that the rod of correction
[31:21] is in the hand of the one that hung on
[31:22] calvary
[31:24] and that nail hole is there
[31:27] it's more pain to him this is to you
[31:31] that's my point okay let's get a little
[31:33] bit of doing if you heard the prophet
[31:36] say this and i want to just go over it
[31:37] and i decided well i'll just read them
[31:39] and that way people on the internet some
[31:41] people have never heard the thing but
[31:43] you know brother branham in 1933 he had
[31:46] a vision
[31:49] and he saw seven things
[31:52] in the vision all right
[31:54] now we'll get to it in a little bit when
[31:56] we get down to it he says now five of
[31:58] those seven has already taken place
[32:01] well all right
[32:03] now what about god showing a man
[32:08] not only what
[32:10] would future come because where he stood
[32:12] with the 33 you got to go this way a
[32:15] little bit to get to world war ii
[32:17] totally in with it or you got to back up
[32:19] this way to get part of what would take
[32:21] care you know in this part of the
[32:23] visions and things so get the point he
[32:25] he's seeing the pious the present and
[32:27] the future
[32:29] all right
[32:30] and in doing that see then he showed
[32:33] these things
[32:34] and he says five of them has taken place
[32:37] well do you realize what that means
[32:40] we're not in the days of adolf hitler
[32:43] we're not in the days of mussolini and
[32:47] where are we at
[32:51] see
[32:55] where's the day and hour that you and me
[32:56] are living
[32:59] we're not in those days those days are
[33:02] priced
[33:04] all right let's read the things and just
[33:06] take and see what's pies and see what's
[33:09] present
[33:12] and then see the future
[33:15] and where is the prophet said that we
[33:17] miss it at
[33:19] by looking back or looking forward and
[33:22] failing to realize what's taking place
[33:25] right now
[33:26] that's the whole point of christianity
[33:28] to me christianity is a positive present
[33:32] tense word
[33:35] the bible is a positive present tense
[33:38] word in other words right now
[33:41] and when we realize what's taking place
[33:43] right now
[33:45] we might realize the prophet stood back
[33:47] there and knowed a whole lot more than
[33:48] what he said
[33:49] because one time i remember on the sixth
[33:51] seal he said lord i can't tell them that
[33:55] there's things that he just couldn't
[33:56] tell i don't know what it was and
[33:58] nobody's worried about it but he said he
[34:00] couldn't do it
[34:02] all right but see what i want you to do
[34:04] is look at yourself and think about god
[34:07] is correcting us
[34:10] but he's doing it by giving you and me
[34:13] not a whipping bout with a belt or or
[34:16] even anything but he's bringing to us
[34:18] the word
[34:22] and showing the day that we're living by
[34:25] the word
[34:28] right the hour that we're living
[34:30] but do we look at it like that's right
[34:35] well i want to see these great
[34:36] revelations
[34:38] well what about finding yourself
[34:41] written in the word
[34:45] huh
[34:47] finding yourself you know there's a lot
[34:49] of people that can take this and that
[34:50] and the other and they can do it with
[34:51] words and things and that and they put
[34:53] you right in the scripture
[34:55] your names and everything else
[34:58] but see that's not no good
[35:00] what i want to know is where i'm at
[35:01] right now
[35:05] i want to see what the word says about
[35:07] what we're doing so go ahead brothers
[35:09] and pull up number
[35:10] number one and let's uh
[35:13] let's get into this
[35:16] and if i take a little time let's just
[35:18] forgive me i want to read most of it
[35:19] because i want you to understand okay
[35:22] from the ladies in church age
[35:26] he says the latest in age began around
[35:29] the turn of the century
[35:31] perhaps 1906. how long will it last as
[35:35] as a servant of god who has had multiple
[35:38] multitudes of visions
[35:41] of which none has ever failed let me
[35:44] predict i did not say prophesy
[35:47] but predict now he never prophesied 77
[35:52] would be the the end of it
[35:55] he predicted
[35:58] but i've heard and certain services and
[36:00] i know you have preachers that have
[36:03] spent hours trying to prove
[36:06] that a prediction is as great as a
[36:08] prophecy well now your prophet says no
[36:11] that sounds a problem
[36:13] but yet they've done that and then they
[36:15] took and made dates out of things
[36:20] but you never see them when they wound
[36:22] up that their date don't work
[36:24] coming back and saying now you see them
[36:26] with more more dates coming up in other
[36:29] words they start on something else but
[36:31] now listen
[36:32] this age will end around 1977. why
[36:37] that's a prediction that's not thus
[36:38] saith the lord
[36:40] if you will pardon a personal note here
[36:43] i based this prediction
[36:47] on seven major continuous visions that
[36:49] came to me one sunday morning in june
[36:52] 1933. the lord jesus spoke to me and
[36:54] said that the coming of the lord was
[36:57] drawing nigh
[36:59] but that before he came seven major
[37:02] events would transpire
[37:04] i wrote them all
[37:07] down
[37:08] and
[37:09] down and that morning i gave forth
[37:12] okay from what gave forth the revelation
[37:15] of of the lord the first vision now
[37:18] watch let's go one two three four the
[37:20] first vision was that mussolini would
[37:23] invade
[37:24] ethiopia
[37:26] and that nation would fall at his steps
[37:29] that vision surely did cause some
[37:32] repercussions because people didn't
[37:34] believe it's going to happen by the way
[37:35] see all right
[37:37] and some were very angry when i said it
[37:40] and would not believe it
[37:42] but it happened that way
[37:44] he just walked in there with his modern
[37:46] arms and took over the natives didn't
[37:49] have a chance because they didn't have
[37:50] anything to fight with
[37:52] but the vision
[37:53] also said
[37:55] that mussolini would come to a horrible
[37:57] end
[37:58] with his own people turning on him that
[38:01] came to pass just exactly
[38:03] as it was saying all right now do you
[38:06] believe that
[38:08] you know
[38:09] i'm asking you and i'll ask each time as
[38:12] we go
[38:13] did that take place
[38:16] did it happen the way that god showed
[38:18] him that mussolini would
[38:20] go down to ethiopia and he'd try to take
[38:22] over and everything and all and it would
[38:25] wind up that his own people would turn
[38:27] against him
[38:29] and kill him
[38:31] all right
[38:32] now do you believe that happened
[38:35] well what about a man standing in 1933
[38:38] and telling you that
[38:44] see what about my point is let's see how
[38:46] positive back there he saw things
[38:51] and let's see where we're at can we see
[38:53] it as positive right now
[38:56] can you take right now and put it in the
[38:58] bible
[39:03] i'm just asking you can you do it can
[39:05] you take right now and put it in the
[39:06] bible and know where you're at
[39:10] all right
[39:11] the next which would be the next vision
[39:13] secondly
[39:14] or part of it you know
[39:16] vision foretold that an australian by
[39:18] the name of adolf hitler would rise up
[39:20] as
[39:21] dictator over germany and that it would
[39:24] draw the world into war it showed the
[39:27] cigna line and how that our troops would
[39:30] have a terrible time to overcome it then
[39:32] it showed that hitler would come to a
[39:36] mysterious end
[39:40] what happened he pulled back in in a
[39:42] thing him and he got his uh little wife
[39:44] finally she
[39:45] according to what they said finally that
[39:47] that day they got married and things and
[39:49] and he took her underground and killed
[39:51] herself
[39:53] come to mysteriously and they argued
[39:55] that it wasn't him that's no problem so
[39:57] it's a mysterious thing that's the point
[39:59] do you believe that happened
[40:01] do you believe that hitler took the
[40:03] world to war
[40:06] and we fought it out with him and
[40:08] finally won almost losing it
[40:14] do you believe that happened
[40:16] okay
[40:18] the third vision was in the realm of
[40:20] world politics
[40:21] where it showed me that there would be
[40:24] three great isms fascism nazism
[40:27] communism
[40:28] but that the first two would be
[40:30] swallowed up into the third
[40:33] the voice admonished watch russia watch
[40:37] russia keep your eye on the king of the
[40:39] north because there's your king of the
[40:40] north in the bible that comes down
[40:43] to war israel you know when it come down
[40:46] and and hitler
[40:48] brought it all to a war
[40:50] and then after him comes
[40:53] the thing and then then you got
[40:55] communism coming up
[40:58] and communism ruled russia and all this
[41:01] for a long time
[41:03] now do you believe that happened
[41:07] not only did
[41:09] not only the prophet saying it
[41:12] but do you believe naturally did it
[41:13] happen
[41:15] because a lot of those things were
[41:17] naturally happening and taking place all
[41:18] right the fourth vision
[41:20] showed the great advance in science
[41:23] that would come after the second world
[41:24] war
[41:26] it was headed up in the vision of a
[41:27] plastic bubble topped car that was
[41:30] running down
[41:31] beautiful highways under remote control
[41:34] so that people appeared sitting in their
[41:36] car without a steering wheel
[41:38] and they were playing some sort of game
[41:41] to amuse themselves
[41:44] now
[41:46] there's one you can really move a lot
[41:48] because what about the prophet seeing
[41:50] that in 33
[41:53] it only happened maybe
[41:56] they're just now still getting into the
[41:57] works of doing it uh they have it
[42:01] but i mean we'll say all right 10 years
[42:03] ago
[42:05] or 20 years ago they finally come up
[42:07] with that but he saw it back there
[42:13] you know what a prophet to me i this is
[42:15] the way i see a prophet in the way he
[42:17] sees things in visions and dreams and
[42:20] things
[42:21] present tense
[42:24] he don't see nothing in the past
[42:28] they ain't talking about not seeing the
[42:29] pies now i'm talking about when he has a
[42:32] vision it's present tense
[42:37] when the word of god unveils to a
[42:39] prophet it's present tense
[42:41] when are we gonna get to be there
[42:44] and think that away
[42:47] that you realize this message has
[42:49] brought the bible
[42:51] from undercover
[42:53] brought it out into the open
[42:55] that we can read it and realize what's
[42:57] taking place
[42:59] and has taken place but it's taking
[43:01] place now
[43:05] you realize that
[43:07] see he saw all of the great things that
[43:10] would come with the cars and the things
[43:12] he saw the future
[43:14] that would come that's naaman naaman saw
[43:16] chariots jostling in the streets which
[43:19] what did he see he saw buick's
[43:20] oldsmobile running into each other and
[43:22] the bible says they're running like
[43:24] lightning in other words there was
[43:25] headlights running down the roads and
[43:27] highway see the bible is perfectly pure
[43:30] in the basis of telling us right where
[43:32] we're at if we'll just read it that away
[43:34] and listen to it
[43:37] and we can see the very hour that we're
[43:39] living
[43:41] he stood back there and saw all of these
[43:43] things taking place
[43:45] 50 years before it ever come into a car
[43:48] being anything like that
[43:52] because he was seeing
[43:55] the future
[43:56] but to him it was present tense it was
[43:58] real
[44:00] all right now the fifth
[44:02] had to do with moral
[44:04] problem of our age
[44:06] all right centering mostly
[44:10] now forgive me sisters in this
[44:13] it talks pretty hard
[44:15] but
[44:16] you take your own place because if you
[44:17] get your feelings heard about
[44:19] what a prophet said about you just
[44:21] remember
[44:23] check and see if it's true
[44:26] if it's true then then you pitch your
[44:28] own feelings and get them off of
[44:31] certainly mostly centering mostly around
[44:33] women god showed me that women began to
[44:36] be out of their place
[44:38] with the granting of the vote
[44:40] then they cut off their hire which
[44:42] signified that they were no longer under
[44:44] the authority of a man but instead on
[44:48] either equal rights
[44:51] are in most cases
[44:54] more than equal rights
[44:56] she's adopted men's clothing
[44:59] and
[45:01] she's adopted men's clothing and went
[45:03] into a state of undress
[45:06] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[45:08] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[45:11] apron
[45:12] with this vision i saw the terrible
[45:14] perversion and moral
[45:16] plight of the whole world
[45:22] now that's five of them
[45:24] and he says they've come to piss
[45:27] we can say it's come to pass
[45:29] why because we've lived in it
[45:32] we're living in it now
[45:35] right lady will see us here
[45:38] we can talk all we want to about glory
[45:40] hallelujah
[45:41] but just remember
[45:43] we're at the end
[45:46] all right not a doomsday preacher i've
[45:48] never been that way i've never done it
[45:51] even back years ago when i stood and
[45:53] said we could pass the year 2026 i never
[45:56] told nobody then to be afraid of
[45:59] anything i just told everybody to be
[46:01] ready
[46:04] you mean you've done that yeah cause
[46:06] you're sitting here listening to him
[46:07] because you know i've done it
[46:08] why because something spoke to him and
[46:11] told me
[46:12] all right now you you trying to make you
[46:15] a prophet
[46:16] i'm me what are you
[46:19] i ain't worried about it
[46:21] because i know i'm not
[46:25] but i know i'm a child of god
[46:27] and i know god can speak to you
[46:29] and tell you things i believe that all
[46:32] right now watch
[46:35] going to the next round now five of them
[46:38] he said had taken place
[46:40] now watch what he's dealing in the sixth
[46:42] vision
[46:43] i rose up in america a most beautiful
[46:46] but cruel woman
[46:48] she held the people in her
[46:52] complete power
[46:57] and this is where i hate it
[47:00] because i'm always getting myself in
[47:01] trouble
[47:03] because i'm always just plain about it
[47:08] now you remember when
[47:14] we had a woman going to run for
[47:15] president
[47:18] instead of going in the bible and seeing
[47:22] that that's what the bible said would
[47:24] take place
[47:26] the prophet had said it
[47:28] you know what it wound up being a joke
[47:32] there rose up in america most beautiful
[47:35] but cruel woman boy that was the ugliest
[47:38] woman i've ever seen that's all
[47:40] preachers preached about i said this
[47:41] can't be the one
[47:43] this can't be the one that'll wind up
[47:45] and do this cause she's so ugly
[47:49] and you know what the carnegie
[47:51] hey you know everybody just oh she's
[47:54] ugly
[47:55] he it can't be the end because she's
[47:57] ugly and she's a pretty woman
[48:01] you understand what i'm saying it always
[48:04] gets me in trouble because i expose
[48:06] people's ignorance
[48:11] what has it got to do with it
[48:15] it didn't say anything about the bible
[48:17] saying the woman and the thing it's
[48:19] because they were saying that she was
[48:22] ugly
[48:25] come on preachers where are you at now
[48:28] well i was just making a joke
[48:35] okay
[48:36] but look
[48:37] and in the sixth vision i rose up in
[48:39] america most beautiful
[48:42] but cruel woman
[48:44] she held the people in her com complete
[48:46] power i believe that this was the rise
[48:50] of the roman catholic church
[48:52] though i knew it would possibly be
[48:56] a vision
[48:58] of some woman rising in great power in
[49:00] america due to a popular vote
[49:05] by the women
[49:08] all right
[49:10] so he looked at it as being
[49:13] that he never said brother branham never
[49:15] brought thus saith the lord
[49:16] on the part that i've been able to find
[49:18] to just say uh it says the lord it's the
[49:21] catholic church or it's thus saith the
[49:22] lord it's women you know
[49:25] he just left it
[49:27] he said it could be a woman
[49:32] well you know what he saw in a vision
[49:36] do you think naaman saw buicks and
[49:38] cadillac's running into each other
[49:41] i don't think he did
[49:45] i'm serious i don't think he did
[49:48] i think he saw
[49:49] chariots
[49:52] but was told what they would be
[49:55] chariots were horses and
[49:57] buggies and things
[49:59] you get what i'm saying but yet that
[50:01] prophet knew and when he
[50:03] said it'd be like charis johnson in the
[50:06] street that would be thousands of years
[50:08] later before it ever transpired
[50:13] what are you trying to get to brother
[50:15] dale
[50:16] all right that's the seventh thing the
[50:18] last one
[50:20] was wherein i heard a
[50:22] most heart terrible explosion as i
[50:25] turned to look i saw nothing but debris
[50:28] created craters and smoke all over the
[50:30] land of america he saw the total
[50:33] destruction
[50:34] of this land
[50:38] now
[50:40] when he stood back there
[50:42] that would have been
[50:43] [Music]
[50:44] probably 1960 because the church age
[50:47] book where it comes in here would have
[50:48] been a little after that anywhere 1960
[50:52] somewhere in there he spoke of the
[50:55] things that would take place
[51:00] but do we believe they've taken place
[51:06] he said five of those things had taken
[51:08] place
[51:14] what about the sixes
[51:16] we know the seventh one hasn't taken
[51:17] place yet because that's the life we can
[51:19] know for sure till that but what about
[51:22] number six
[51:24] where that he saw the women and the
[51:26] condition
[51:30] and did he see it perfectly right of
[51:32] what the women are today and and the
[51:34] situation and the clothing and all of
[51:36] the things
[51:37] did he see it
[51:39] right
[51:40] and spoke of it
[51:44] sorry to be saying that but see our
[51:46] point my point is
[51:48] when we don't know what to come up with
[51:52] as an answer to some things we make it a
[51:55] joke
[51:58] we say
[51:59] well
[52:01] can't be hillary
[52:06] cause she's ugly
[52:09] we think that satisfies or says what god
[52:12] is saying about it god was showing the
[52:14] man
[52:17] this end time
[52:21] now i want to approach it like this
[52:27] on two points
[52:30] the biggest portion of the white house
[52:32] today is catholic right
[52:35] now i didn't look up to see
[52:38] whether biden is or this one is or that
[52:41] he is maybe you do maybe you know i'm
[52:43] not concerned
[52:45] i'm concerned with one thing that when i
[52:48] first come in this message brother
[52:49] branham said they'll worm their way into
[52:51] the white house
[52:53] i got every book i could get a hold of i
[52:55] got everything i could find that had any
[52:58] connection to do with the the
[53:01] you know the the situation at the white
[53:03] house and come to find out there was
[53:05] like 1500
[53:08] catholic roman catholics already in the
[53:10] white house and you know a lot of those
[53:12] people that are put in those offices are
[53:14] put in there for life
[53:18] am i right
[53:22] see i was interested in seeing how many
[53:24] catholics it was not whether hillary was
[53:26] pretty or not
[53:29] to me that shows your silliness
[53:32] that you want to make a joke out of
[53:34] something
[53:38] all right
[53:40] let's see if we're in the end time where
[53:42] that is really right among us
[53:50] what about uh
[53:55] well
[53:56] let's go on
[53:58] i'm trying to find a way to approach it
[54:00] where you'll understand what i'm driving
[54:01] at
[54:02] not not to what a
[54:04] is doing
[54:06] but listen
[54:14] they started running women for president
[54:17] about what four turns back
[54:19] three terms or something like that four
[54:21] three or four turns back women started
[54:23] running for president on the tickets and
[54:25] getting a little bit and getting out
[54:27] and you'd wind up with enough to do this
[54:30] and do that
[54:32] and people begin to talk about say okay
[54:35] a woman in the white house
[54:37] a woman in the white house
[54:39] all right
[54:41] and said well there ain't no woman in
[54:42] the white house so we're okay we're
[54:45] running okay because ain't no woman in
[54:46] the white house
[54:48] well
[54:49] now what are you gonna say when you got
[54:51] one in the white house now
[54:59] have you really thought it over where
[55:01] you're sitting
[55:03] that you're sitting exactly in the
[55:06] number six that the prophet said
[55:11] you realize we're right in the middle of
[55:13] that
[55:18] when the prophet spoke of a
[55:21] woman in the white house
[55:25] the people just started laughing and
[55:26] making more jokes
[55:32] i begin to think about it lord
[55:36] let me keep up with these things
[55:39] you realize now that we have a thus
[55:41] saith the lord
[55:44] what's your prophet say it twice
[55:49] about the woman in the white house
[55:55] but do you think it's just another joke
[55:57] see
[55:58] you know you understand what i'm getting
[56:00] at out
[56:01] we laughed about the
[56:04] pretty woman oh that can't be
[56:07] because she's ugly
[56:09] we thought that solved all of those
[56:10] situations but you know what that was
[56:13] that was the first inroad of the woman
[56:15] into the white house
[56:17] she almost made it
[56:20] right
[56:21] hillary almost wound up being vice
[56:23] president
[56:25] or president
[56:30] well
[56:32] what are we looking at now
[56:36] when the prophet said thus saith the
[56:38] lord
[56:39] they would be a woman in the white house
[56:43] president
[56:45] or vice president
[56:49] or the catholic church
[56:57] now if it's true that the biggest
[56:59] portion of that ticket that's owned
[57:02] there that they have you know uh the
[57:04] democratic party and i'm not the one
[57:06] those don't i'm not a democrat or
[57:07] republican not just me
[57:09] if it's true
[57:12] that they're there having that
[57:15] the biggest portion of the catholic i
[57:17] mean biggest portion of the white house
[57:18] is catholic
[57:21] well that would put number one at the
[57:22] prophet said
[57:24] that it would be a maybe the catholic
[57:26] church
[57:28] so we're to fulfillment of that
[57:33] the biggest portion of the white house
[57:35] is catholic
[57:40] and we're in the time of that of them
[57:42] being in the white house
[57:44] and now you have a vice president
[57:51] a woman vice president
[57:55] which is what the prophet said would
[57:57] take place in 1960.
[58:05] a woman in the white house but are we
[58:08] serious or we just come up with some
[58:11] kind of a joke
[58:19] can you see that you're in the very
[58:21] pages of the bible being fulfilled right
[58:24] now
[58:25] amen
[58:29] because this is not just a prophecy
[58:33] he said it's thus saith the lord
[58:38] all right
[58:40] that's what a lot of people go through
[58:42] they say oh they you know back there for
[58:44] years ago there ain't been no woman in
[58:46] the white house
[58:48] now you have one
[58:51] what are you going now
[58:53] let's read a few things that he said
[58:56] all right go over to number
[58:59] two
[59:01] let's just read a few things that was
[59:03] said about this
[59:06] white house woman situation
[59:09] and the message of why
[59:11] priesthood shreveport
[59:13] louisiana we see the great meeting and
[59:16] conferences that was spoken 25 years ago
[59:20] just take place a week or two ago
[59:22] we see the atomic age
[59:24] in other words he's saying the things
[59:26] that's been predicted that i've told you
[59:28] and everything look at it i was quoting
[59:30] last night of prophecy that was given me
[59:33] back in 30 1933 of seven things that
[59:36] would take place germany this sig feed
[59:39] lead line and the president election
[59:42] and all these other things
[59:44] five
[59:45] of them has already taken place two left
[59:49] the coming of the control of a woman in
[59:51] the united states to take over
[59:54] maybe a church
[59:56] to take over to rule watch
[59:59] it's thus saith the lord
[1:00:02] so that's going to be one of the two
[1:00:05] well i'm saying they're both already
[1:00:06] there now
[1:00:09] they're sitting there now
[1:00:12] that's thus saith the lord it's there
[1:00:16] you ever thought that's serious about it
[1:00:17] it's sitting right there now
[1:00:20] you have a vice president
[1:00:23] a woman in the white house you have the
[1:00:26] catholic in control who's going to pay
[1:00:29] our national debt
[1:00:32] come on
[1:00:34] the coming of the controlling the woman
[1:00:36] in the united states to take over maybe
[1:00:38] a church to take over to rule watch it's
[1:00:41] thus saith the lord and then i seen them
[1:00:44] create like atom bombs and goes on the
[1:00:46] wheels and wrote all the things go ahead
[1:00:48] to number three
[1:00:52] from the revelation of jesus christ look
[1:00:54] at the prophecy the lord gave me in 1933
[1:00:57] how that it would happen
[1:00:59] they're permanent they're
[1:01:01] they'd permit women to vote and in
[1:01:04] voting they'd elect the wrong man person
[1:01:06] seven things was
[1:01:08] give and five of them was all has
[1:01:10] already happened the next thing was a
[1:01:13] great woman a church a power or
[1:01:16] something
[1:01:17] would take over the united states to
[1:01:20] rule
[1:01:22] then i've seen it just like the ashes
[1:01:25] now if you don't see
[1:01:30] through all of this things with the
[1:01:32] viruses and things like if you haven't
[1:01:34] followed that to see how much control
[1:01:37] they have that they can do anything they
[1:01:40] want to
[1:01:46] they can close this church anytime they
[1:01:48] want to they don't have to pass no laws
[1:01:52] they're already priced
[1:01:58] everything's done done
[1:02:01] don't worry about rigory
[1:02:03] it's all
[1:02:04] right
[1:02:06] someday i'll tell you
[1:02:08] okay
[1:02:12] going up
[1:02:13] number four
[1:02:18] a few days ago
[1:02:20] now i'm not democrat not republican i'm
[1:02:23] a christian so i don't mention
[1:02:25] these things but i picked up an old book
[1:02:28] that that the lord had given me a vision
[1:02:31] in 33
[1:02:32] now this is 61.
[1:02:35] all right
[1:02:37] and i just first become a minister going
[1:02:40] down to the baptist and thing
[1:02:42] and he gave me a vision that morning and
[1:02:45] i seen the first
[1:02:47] one i remember
[1:02:49] of an international affair
[1:02:52] and in there and seeing that we'd go to
[1:02:54] a world war
[1:02:56] then i've seen also that it would be the
[1:02:59] 11 years for the the signet
[1:03:03] magnet
[1:03:04] was built i seen the germany
[1:03:07] fortify themselves
[1:03:09] in this big concrete place
[1:03:11] also seeing that they permitted women to
[1:03:13] vote
[1:03:14] which was wrong and said they would they
[1:03:17] would someday elect the wrong man
[1:03:20] they just did it
[1:03:23] so now who was elected
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] crew cut haircut
[1:03:30] kennedy right
[1:03:32] all right
[1:03:33] so then i seen at the time the end of
[1:03:35] the coming and the five things that the
[1:03:37] lord and he said in seven
[1:03:40] five of them's already taken place now
[1:03:41] what i want you to get to
[1:03:43] i don't know roll it on up and we'll
[1:03:45] save time reading the woman stand up
[1:03:48] to the in the to the united states we
[1:03:50] can write this down if you do you can
[1:03:53] write this down it's going to happen i
[1:03:55] don't know she's on her road now exactly
[1:03:58] and she took over and then i seen the
[1:04:00] united states just like something that
[1:04:02] was blowed over so he looked down and
[1:04:05] saw
[1:04:07] what it was going to take place with the
[1:04:09] women go ahead number five the 70th week
[1:04:12] of daniel
[1:04:15] number five
[1:04:20] and now that brings us then to the
[1:04:21] election of the president kennedy and
[1:04:23] this car coming on the scene now he's in
[1:04:25] the vision right telling him bringing
[1:04:27] five things out of the seven that has
[1:04:30] happened
[1:04:31] exactly five of them in other words
[1:04:32] already taken place now i predict and
[1:04:35] said i saw a great woman stand up
[1:04:37] beautiful looking
[1:04:38] dressed and real highly royals
[1:04:42] like purple
[1:04:44] and i got the little
[1:04:46] for instance down there
[1:04:47] she was a great ruler in the united
[1:04:50] states
[1:04:51] perhaps the catholic church a woman some
[1:04:54] woman
[1:04:55] i don't know her
[1:04:58] to be the catholic church in other words
[1:05:00] he didn't know it to be he if he had it
[1:05:02] he said this is thus faith the lord but
[1:05:04] he knew it was either the a woman or
[1:05:07] the catholic church that's my point okay
[1:05:09] i don't know to be the catholic church i
[1:05:11] don't know don't say only thing i've
[1:05:13] seen i seen the women that was all but
[1:05:16] this is a woman's nation this is a
[1:05:20] she's got 13 stripes 13 stars
[1:05:22] and she's a woman's nation
[1:05:25] so you can see that we're here
[1:05:29] but do you realize we're here
[1:05:33] or you want to make a joke
[1:05:37] you want to come up with some kind of a
[1:05:40] joke to people instead of coming up and
[1:05:42] telling them the truth
[1:05:48] you realize what i'm saying church we're
[1:05:50] at the end
[1:05:51] whether you want to believe it or not or
[1:05:53] want to no no we're not making dates we
[1:05:55] ain't setting dates ain't never said
[1:05:56] nothing
[1:05:59] because ain't nothing to it your life
[1:06:01] and you're making a joke yourself
[1:06:03] because no man knows a day or an hour
[1:06:05] but don't say god don't know it he knows
[1:06:07] it and he can reveal it right
[1:06:10] but let's read read number six cause
[1:06:11] wade read this one
[1:06:13] here a while back on it
[1:06:15] from that time
[1:06:18] so i won't have time in this meeting to
[1:06:21] tell you in 1933 this is a woman's
[1:06:23] nation
[1:06:24] it's the number 13 it appears in the
[1:06:26] 13th chapter of revelation 13 stars 13
[1:06:30] stripes 13 everything was a 13.
[1:06:32] everything is a woman
[1:06:34] and remember
[1:06:37] thus saith the lord
[1:06:40] there will be a woman rule before the
[1:06:43] end time
[1:06:45] now watch him
[1:06:48] she'll either be president
[1:06:53] vice president
[1:06:55] or it'll be the catholic church
[1:06:58] as a woman i've seen her
[1:07:04] that's either president
[1:07:08] or a vice president
[1:07:10] or it can be the catholic church so
[1:07:12] we're still right right
[1:07:14] what's the biggest portion of the
[1:07:16] people are they're catholics
[1:07:19] so it's going to take over somebody's
[1:07:20] going to take over and i'll be done but
[1:07:22] my point is this
[1:07:24] your life and make jokes about doing but
[1:07:27] here's the prophet saying it and look
[1:07:30] what he says great warmer nation bowed
[1:07:33] to her it'll be one
[1:07:34] one before the end time thus saith the
[1:07:37] lord write it down and find out you
[1:07:40] young people see if it happens
[1:07:44] if it isn't
[1:07:46] i'm a false prophet
[1:07:48] now who would want to challenge like
[1:07:50] that
[1:07:51] who would be able to stand up and say
[1:07:53] i'll be a false prophet if this don't
[1:07:55] come to pass
[1:07:57] he was basing it on something wouldn't
[1:07:59] he
[1:08:00] he said thus saith the lord twice of
[1:08:02] what it would be
[1:08:04] all right
[1:08:05] we can say well we don't know we we we
[1:08:08] don't know we have the bible being
[1:08:11] fulfilled right to the letter
[1:08:14] the woman's in the white house
[1:08:17] are you looking for a woman to raise up
[1:08:19] and become ruling this nation she's
[1:08:21] already there she's in the white house
[1:08:24] she's the vice president
[1:08:28] even one step from being president all
[1:08:30] it takes is a bullet between the eyes
[1:08:32] and and she gets the job
[1:08:34] i ain't joking
[1:08:36] making no point i'm just saying it
[1:08:40] but see we we look at things and we live
[1:08:43] like say no that can't be this because
[1:08:45] of that we'll come up with some little
[1:08:47] something that always comes up with some
[1:08:49] little
[1:08:50] idea well now
[1:08:53] brother dale the prophet said it could
[1:08:54] be in the catholic church
[1:08:56] i preached that all the way through i've
[1:08:58] always said that
[1:09:01] where'd she come from
[1:09:04] where'd this lady come from that's
[1:09:06] vice president
[1:09:08] what's her background
[1:09:11] i don't know and don't care
[1:09:13] ain't got nothing to do with me
[1:09:16] ain't got nothing against her ain't got
[1:09:17] nothing against anything
[1:09:21] but i'm just saying can we realize we're
[1:09:23] here
[1:09:27] to him that overcometh
[1:09:30] will i grant
[1:09:33] let me say it this way to he that
[1:09:35] understandeth
[1:09:38] he didn't have the ears let him hear
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:42] we're here at the end time
[1:09:44] from a thus saith the lord we're not
[1:09:46] life in it whether or not this lady is
[1:09:48] pretty or ugly
[1:09:53] we're not making jokes
[1:09:55] i ain't joking
[1:09:57] i'm as serious as i can ever be in my
[1:09:59] life
[1:10:06] well you're scaring me you're scaring my
[1:10:07] child if i scare you
[1:10:10] then there's something wrong with you
[1:10:12] because if the bible tells you yes
[1:10:17] if the prophet can tell you a dust saith
[1:10:20] the lord
[1:10:21] about something that it's going to be
[1:10:23] that away
[1:10:27] and that's the way it's going to be
[1:10:32] not a joke
[1:10:36] it's the truth
[1:10:38] we're at the end
[1:10:42] see anything can take place now i'm not
[1:10:45] i'm not trying to scare nobody children
[1:10:47] i'm not trying to scare you you've done
[1:10:48] okay so far haven't you
[1:10:51] i mean everything's running okay right
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:55] i ain't trying to scare nobody i'm just
[1:10:57] trying to tell us are we concerned
[1:10:59] enough to see whether we're
[1:11:01] where we are at because the message
[1:11:04] tells us where we are
[1:11:09] the message tells us where we're at
[1:11:12] we're at the end of all things
[1:11:20] see
[1:11:22] now look what i'm talking about
[1:11:24] back a few years ago when they come up
[1:11:26] with a bubble car and the thing oh where
[1:11:29] we that's what the prophet said that
[1:11:32] it's a volkswagen it's this it's that oh
[1:11:34] everybody was just so open in messages
[1:11:37] you heard it there's preaching and
[1:11:39] everything oh look and look at all this
[1:11:40] look
[1:11:41] we're where the prophet said it well
[1:11:44] what about now where he said thus saith
[1:11:46] the lord
[1:11:50] not looking for a bubble car
[1:11:55] looking at the word being revealed
[1:12:02] you understand what i'm saying i started
[1:12:04] off by saying
[1:12:06] asking you
[1:12:08] do you believe this message
[1:12:11] is the end time message
[1:12:16] do you believe that we've had thus saith
[1:12:18] the lord brought into our hands
[1:12:24] but brother dale uh you know
[1:12:27] we may be around here 50 years that
[1:12:28] ain't going to do with it i never said
[1:12:30] nothing like that
[1:12:37] but i am saying one thing we're in the
[1:12:39] time frame or whatever you want to call
[1:12:41] it the situation the existence of where
[1:12:44] this is being fulfilled right in their
[1:12:46] eyes
[1:12:47] you know there was one day when two cars
[1:12:50] run into each other
[1:12:51] that fulfilled
[1:12:55] the profit
[1:12:56] of him seeing charis jostling in the
[1:12:58] streets that fulfilled that
[1:13:02] you realize the day she that she walked
[1:13:04] into the white house that fulfilled what
[1:13:06] your prophet said
[1:13:09] that makes me more realizing that he was
[1:13:12] a prophet than i did before
[1:13:16] why because
[1:13:18] we're living in that day
[1:13:22] the bible is being unfolded right down
[1:13:25] in this age that we're living
[1:13:33] granted to sit with him in his throne
[1:13:35] where was his throne
[1:13:37] well he was here on earth that was his
[1:13:39] throne
[1:13:41] right
[1:13:42] then you move into different thrones you
[1:13:43] could take a long time on preaching a
[1:13:45] sermon on it but yet my point is this
[1:13:49] there come a time
[1:13:52] there come a time when the bible was
[1:13:54] fulfilled
[1:13:58] what if
[1:13:59] that was the last
[1:14:02] we don't want to be here when the
[1:14:03] seventh heaven helped right because
[1:14:04] that's a total destruction so we want to
[1:14:06] move that one out right in other words
[1:14:08] push that over a little bit to the side
[1:14:10] don't call that the end of all things
[1:14:12] the end of all things is what's taking
[1:14:14] place in your mind in my mind right now
[1:14:16] leading us in the wrong direction
[1:14:19] wade's preached it to you over and over
[1:14:21] about your two spirits about your your
[1:14:23] mind and where the controlling power is
[1:14:25] at and what it's doing
[1:14:31] see
[1:14:37] seven things
[1:14:39] and we like one
[1:14:41] there's no way like no don't we don't
[1:14:43] like two
[1:14:44] come on that's my whole point i ain't
[1:14:46] gonna argue with you i'm just gonna tell
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:48] we're already in the sixth one
[1:14:52] the minute she walked into the white
[1:14:54] house we were in the sixth one
[1:14:58] because the catholic people had already
[1:15:00] beat her there
[1:15:02] and i don't know whether she is or not i
[1:15:04] don't care
[1:15:06] i hope she's a christian
[1:15:08] that'd be the only thing that i could
[1:15:10] judge on anything or hope for her
[1:15:13] because i don't have anything against
[1:15:14] those people
[1:15:17] i've preached all the way down where we
[1:15:18] would wind up and what would be
[1:15:22] the prophet said on that fourth seal
[1:15:24] that said catholics and protestants
[1:15:26] coming together
[1:15:32] there's your war
[1:15:38] see church i'm not looking for something
[1:15:39] to take place if you understand what i'm
[1:15:41] talking about well brother dale i'm
[1:15:42] looking for this i'm looking for that
[1:15:46] and it hadn't taken place yet
[1:15:48] well
[1:15:51] at least the prophet said six of them
[1:15:53] have
[1:15:55] so that's
[1:15:57] of that part
[1:16:00] yeah but you're you're trying to scare
[1:16:02] us
[1:16:03] i can't scare you
[1:16:07] and i wouldn't tried if i could
[1:16:09] i've always told you parents i've told
[1:16:12] you from the pulpit don't scare your
[1:16:14] children with daddy with god being a
[1:16:17] booger bearer
[1:16:21] don't say god hates you doing this or
[1:16:24] that
[1:16:26] don't say it
[1:16:27] you're building a mental part of their
[1:16:29] mind that's that's going to hurt them
[1:16:31] later on when they need it
[1:16:36] huh
[1:16:38] don't do it
[1:16:40] whip them
[1:16:41] is anything wrong bible says
[1:16:45] be the child they won't die
[1:16:47] with them
[1:16:49] but don't try to scare them with a with
[1:16:51] a god that don't like it
[1:16:55] because here's one standing in front of
[1:16:57] you telling you i don't like it parents
[1:16:59] for you to try to scare i'm not trying
[1:17:02] to make you afraid i'm trying to get you
[1:17:05] to see we're here
[1:17:09] we're not having to wait to get here we
[1:17:12] are here
[1:17:15] the end of all things has come upon us
[1:17:18] the last thing would be the destruction
[1:17:20] of the world or the united states when
[1:17:22] nuclear which one you want to argue
[1:17:24] those things it'll be you know
[1:17:28] i just don't want to be there
[1:17:34] but i want to be ready against that day
[1:17:37] i'm looking at things in a positive
[1:17:39] attitude instead of a negative
[1:17:48] but did we say well we don't know
[1:17:51] because we you know
[1:17:53] there's a
[1:17:54] woman in the white house and everything
[1:17:57] when that woman walked in that
[1:17:59] situation there i
[1:18:01] i was looking at you
[1:18:04] and i was thinking
[1:18:06] how many chur how many of us church
[1:18:08] really see it
[1:18:11] and realize
[1:18:13] that when that woman walked into the
[1:18:15] white house it fulfilled the prophet's
[1:18:17] form
[1:18:18] of the word
[1:18:22] he said it
[1:18:28] he said president
[1:18:30] or vice president
[1:18:35] well
[1:18:38] why not say we're at the end because the
[1:18:40] word is now being fulfilled
[1:18:46] i knew i'd have trouble trying to bring
[1:18:48] this today because i've studied on it
[1:18:50] now for months
[1:18:52] trying to get a little point of where we
[1:18:53] can see church i'm not trying to get us
[1:18:56] to see that god is coming
[1:18:59] your prophet said i'm not saying god is
[1:19:02] coming he said i'm saying god is here
[1:19:09] what
[1:19:13] was he there
[1:19:14] yes
[1:19:15] you said well to him only well then when
[1:19:18] is it going to be to me and you
[1:19:24] when's the day coming when we can say
[1:19:27] i see
[1:19:28] what the prophet said
[1:19:31] he said there'd be cars i remember when
[1:19:33] that first started off and talking cars
[1:19:35] you know and they were trying back then
[1:19:37] because the volkswagen hadn't bugged out
[1:19:39] as much but
[1:19:40] there was more carrying than like the 40
[1:19:42] ford uh
[1:19:44] old ford uh what was the 48 or which one
[1:19:47] of them was it was sloped over and and
[1:19:50] run all the way over they talked about
[1:19:52] it being the forward they talked about
[1:19:53] it being this then they come up talking
[1:19:54] about it being the volkswagen
[1:20:00] not realizing there was two more things
[1:20:04] that had already been prophesied
[1:20:06] would have to take place
[1:20:11] it would be more important than a
[1:20:12] volkswagen drove down the road without
[1:20:15] a steering wheel
[1:20:19] but would see women actually walk in or
[1:20:22] a woman walk in to
[1:20:25] the white house
[1:20:30] when i heard that i said
[1:20:32] thank you lord
[1:20:35] that's what your prophet said would take
[1:20:36] place
[1:20:39] that's thus saith the lord
[1:20:42] that's what the bible says go to
[1:20:43] revelation 17 now see i had all that
[1:20:46] wrote down i got a lot on it but what
[1:20:48] about revelation 17 of the old mother
[1:20:50] and the harley daughters and all
[1:20:52] of those things
[1:20:54] and you say well what if it is a woman
[1:20:55] or what if it's a catholic
[1:20:57] what does it matter that's the point
[1:20:59] that i'm going to end with come on
[1:21:01] musician i'm ending with this point what
[1:21:03] does it matter because the woman in the
[1:21:05] white house she's there she's vice
[1:21:07] president
[1:21:08] half of that that are there with her are
[1:21:10] catholics
[1:21:12] so the prophet has already spoken it's
[1:21:14] taking place
[1:21:16] or has taken place
[1:21:19] it's not to look for it
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:23] it's to look at it
[1:21:26] and say thank you lord for telling us
[1:21:30] thank you for telling us
[1:21:34] showing us the truth let's stand
[1:21:35] together
[1:21:38] i'm not trying to scare nobody or
[1:21:40] nothing because ain't no need of trying
[1:21:41] to scare nothing
[1:21:43] it's to tell the truth like the truth is
[1:21:45] supposed to be told
[1:21:48] can we see
[1:21:50] where we're at
[1:21:52] by the word
[1:21:54] that has been brought to us by the
[1:21:56] prophet of this last day
[1:22:02] yeah i come out here one day and i told
[1:22:03] it or i told my wife and then i said
[1:22:06] you know one of these days they'll
[1:22:09] there'll be a bunch of people from
[1:22:10] athens that used to be here they
[1:22:12] went back and
[1:22:15] they're coming back
[1:22:17] well about that time old brother don
[1:22:19] ginn walked in the door
[1:22:21] i said come on
[1:22:23] come on
[1:22:25] how many more
[1:22:28] it just went one after the other
[1:22:31] until a lot of people came
[1:22:34] a lot of them went back they ain't gonna
[1:22:35] do it
[1:22:38] lot of them are
[1:22:39] backslidden and everything else
[1:22:43] but you see i believed that
[1:22:47] and i believe god spoke to me
[1:22:50] now i'm going to say this one
[1:22:53] about 40 years ago
[1:22:56] i stood in this pulpit
[1:22:59] and said the lord showed me
[1:23:01] that the biggest portion of the people
[1:23:02] of this message
[1:23:04] were going to die and go by the grave
[1:23:07] before the rapture
[1:23:10] and i said i did not say and it's dire
[1:23:13] as if we can find the table we have to
[1:23:15] dig a long time
[1:23:16] of course
[1:23:17] you ought to know it anyway i never said
[1:23:21] that they were going to miss it
[1:23:23] i said the biggest portion of the people
[1:23:25] of this message
[1:23:27] which to me meant born-again christians
[1:23:31] was going to die and go by the grave
[1:23:40] i didn't have no trouble standing up and
[1:23:41] saying it because i believe god told me
[1:23:45] he showed me from daniel 70 weeks we
[1:23:46] could pass the year 2026 and not break
[1:23:49] the word of god nor the bible
[1:23:54] he told me and i believe it
[1:23:57] you know what we're gaining on that
[1:23:58] right now
[1:24:00] you know and some of these other things
[1:24:01] that i've said are doing
[1:24:03] is there a lot of people dying and going
[1:24:04] by the grave
[1:24:07] because that was my point
[1:24:09] my point was one thing if we don't
[1:24:11] believe listen if we don't believe where
[1:24:14] we are at and what's taking place right
[1:24:17] now among us is the word of god being
[1:24:21] fulfilled then we're going to die and go
[1:24:24] by the grave
[1:24:26] because we have nothing positive to deal
[1:24:28] with
[1:24:33] well i just don't know
[1:24:35] don't know what
[1:24:38] the prophet said either a woman
[1:24:41] or the catholic church both of them is
[1:24:43] dire
[1:24:45] so don't come and argue with me but well
[1:24:47] it could have been the catholic church
[1:24:48] brother dale that he saw doing that
[1:24:51] i'm the one that's told you that
[1:24:56] he said a woman in the white house
[1:24:59] are the catholic church so he's he's
[1:25:01] right on both points because they're
[1:25:03] both there
[1:25:06] that makes it double to me
[1:25:09] you can argue all you want to about all
[1:25:10] these other things go ahead brother i'm
[1:25:12] sorry
[1:25:13] i've seen that course this is like let's
[1:25:15] see if anybody has an aide
[1:25:17] the older so find many people who can't
[1:25:21] understand
[1:25:23] why we are so happy and free
[1:25:28] we've crossed over jordan to canaan's
[1:25:31] pharaoh
[1:25:33] and this is like heaven to me
[1:25:37] oh this is like heaven to me
[1:25:43] this is
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:57] in the name of jesus christ we lay our
[1:25:59] hands upon our brother he's had trouble
[1:26:01] with his back that's been hurting him
[1:26:03] so we just ask you to take it away from
[1:26:05] me from him in this
[1:26:08] the pain and devil of satan we're jury
[1:26:12] in the name of jesus christ we leave our
[1:26:14] brother
[1:26:15] and make all to be well we love you and
