[1:21] I want to see you amen and amen and amen
[1:52] and amen
[1:53] you want to see him don't you Amen good
[1:56] to be in the house of the Lord
[1:58] good to be gathered together and all
[2:00] even though times are bad and what's
[2:02] going on we can still at this present
[2:05] time together and worship and and always
[2:08] sorry that some has to sit outside and
[2:11] it's little just you know discomfort I
[2:16] guess you called it but I was like I
[2:19] told Wade and gave him a little note our
[2:20] Wednesday and he read it just kind of
[2:23] what I was thinking what would you be
[2:25] doing if if it wasn't for this virus
[2:29] thing unless something really bad would
[2:34] be wrong I'd be a church with you and
[2:37] and that's what we want to be in this
[2:39] that's the point you know of coming
[2:41] together and to be here and have a good
[2:45] time and sorry the inconvenience but
[2:48] that's what I've said what are you gonna
[2:49] do you you know a little bit problems
[2:52] are with it but we will abide until
[2:55] things gets worked out and it'll
[2:57] eventually straighten up enough to to be
[2:59] able to do and whatever but until that
[3:02] time we have to kind of go by that and
[3:05] and just you know make ourselves ready
[3:08] cuz we want to serve God no matter what
[3:11] see and if we can't keep up with the
[3:14] footmen the Bible said what about when
[3:16] the horsemen get here what about when
[3:18] they come in and start making more
[3:19] demands more things you know and all
[3:23] like that least we have to still make a
[3:25] way or find a way to be able to - how
[3:28] services or do something if we have to
[3:30] we'll we'll broadcast right from the
[3:32] house or something will
[3:33] we'll do the best we can do in all to to
[3:37] get it and you think well this is not
[3:40] too bad because it's kind of people are
[3:42] getting used to what's going on now and
[3:44] and you say well it's not too bad but it
[3:46] is pretty bad when you when you can't go
[3:49] where you want to go or you can't go to
[3:50] church can't do that but it's not this
[3:52] church that's what I've tried to tell
[3:54] you this is just the beginning of things
[3:56] because it's it's not into the religious
[4:00] realm this necessarily right now of you
[4:04] know things going on and all like that
[4:07] but yet it is because it's rote
[4:09] controlling and it'll become more and
[4:12] more you'll see the religious room as it
[4:15] begins to unfold and more control will
[4:18] be brought into view that's my my
[4:21] thoughts but if we can't do something
[4:23] now what we're gonna do when that comes
[4:25] you know I mean you know when the time
[4:29] comes for the thing if we can't get
[4:30] along now so you know and that's what I
[4:33] said I don't I don't ask you to our
[4:35] demand you as a passenger to you to do
[4:38] now I just ask you to be what you want
[4:41] to be and if you come to church and all
[4:43] like that and sit outside just do that
[4:46] for the glory of the Lord and let God
[4:48] get to honor and glory out of the whole
[4:50] thing if we can sit inside we said
[4:52] inside we do the best we can do to be
[4:56] able to operate in that way then you
[4:59] know the Lord will take care of all the
[5:02] rest but now I'm like this if we don't
[5:05] put forth an effort this is just me and
[5:08] this is the way I've always been
[5:10] doesn't matter when I think the bad
[5:11] besides this away same now if we don't
[5:15] put forth an effort you know in the
[5:20] times of trouble to be able to move on
[5:23] with the Lord
[5:24] what are we I thought we were you know
[5:29] people of the the Word of God and the
[5:33] Word was telling us what to do not what
[5:35] everybody else tells us so then just
[5:38] think of these things think about it is
[5:40] that we have the time we can do and
[5:43] if they narrow down anymore we do
[5:46] something else we keep moving to
[5:47] whatever we can do and then let that
[5:51] abide and in a you know it'll work out
[5:56] it all come out to the right place all
[5:59] right I know you've done it but make
[6:00] sure you pray for brother al he's still
[6:02] having a lot of problems
[6:03] brother Forney pray for brother Kali and
[6:07] let's pray for all of these brother
[6:10] Roberts brother Dale earth and this
[6:12] sister Mary dougherty and in all of the
[6:16] ones that have what we call major things
[6:19] you know sicknesses and things keep
[6:22] those in mind and just pray that the
[6:25] Lord would bless each one but remember
[6:27] everybody else remember the whole church
[6:28] and just pray that God would bless okay
[6:31] if you like turning your scriptures turn
[6:33] into Luke 17 and we will try to pick up
[6:39] where we were last week and move on and
[6:42] brother Aaron the Lord willing we'll be
[6:44] ministering this coming Wednesday so
[6:46] remember that I know you've already
[6:49] prayed sister Barbara's son they're
[6:52] checking him for the virus and also just
[6:55] remember him he's there in the hospital
[6:57] that's what she called last night about
[6:58] 11:00 there's nothing that you know
[7:01] having problems so remember that okay
[7:03] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[7:06] day and your grace unto us thank you for
[7:09] an opportunity at this time that we can
[7:12] still service have service for you we
[7:15] can come together a little in the
[7:16] convenience but what what is this
[7:18] compared with the early ages in the
[7:20] church and the problems in the
[7:22] heartaches and troubles and the deaths
[7:24] and the sorrows that they went through
[7:26] to try to serve you what little things
[7:29] are we going through what are we playing
[7:31] in Lord in this you know help us to see
[7:35] and to walk in the light of your grace
[7:36] keep us in your growth understanding
[7:39] bless the sick among us and help us to
[7:41] walk in you in Jesus name now we net we
[7:45] said it Wednesday we're not asking you
[7:48] to even to try to come on Wednesdays if
[7:51] you want to come that's fine that's
[7:53] honorable but that's a not service
[7:56] first we're not asking you to do that
[7:59] we're asking you to come to the morning
[8:01] service the evening service on the
[8:03] Sundays and when you're coming up here
[8:04] as Wade was announcing it to make sure
[8:06] you understand where I stand because I
[8:09] was when it wrote the notes on parts of
[8:11] it that you know you if you if you know
[8:14] you're not going to be able you're
[8:16] invited you're chosen to come on Sunday
[8:19] services all right in the insider hour
[8:21] Wednesdays or whatever yeah it's not bad
[8:23] on Wednesday but on Sunday you know if
[8:27] something if something goes wrong we're
[8:29] not you know don't go well how do I get
[8:33] sick well if you get sick we'll pray for
[8:36] the sick but what I'm saying is if you
[8:39] get sick then go to the hospital and
[8:41] nobody won't get to see you and you
[8:43] don't be in service with nobody for a
[8:44] while till they get you cleared up okay
[8:47] being sarcastic
[8:49] okay I'm sarcastic what are you I'm just
[8:51] making it plain to the point that we you
[8:55] know with what we expect don't come for
[8:58] the morning service and then not come
[9:00] back for the evening service let
[9:02] somebody else have that give them that
[9:05] slot you know you're gonna come for one
[9:07] service come for both service you're not
[9:10] gonna come for both service don't come
[9:11] for one let something goes wrong okay
[9:14] that something happens problems and
[9:16] troubles are you clear but see that way
[9:20] you're not taking away from somebody
[9:22] else because you just think about
[9:24] there's a lot of people that like to be
[9:25] setting up here today know both services
[9:28] up here in the building and and if I was
[9:31] one of them I would too and and if I
[9:33] seen you leave out and and not honor the
[9:35] keeping of both services I would I would
[9:39] say hey you know I could have went both
[9:41] of them you know things like that so
[9:44] remember that okay
[9:45] all right just keep in mind all of these
[9:49] things let's read our scripture okay
[9:59] technical difficulty okay versus Luke 17
[10:09] 2002 changed I wasn't gonna do it I had
[10:12] it ready to go and it got changed when I
[10:15] got here so I'll go thisaway
[10:16] and when he was demanded of the
[10:19] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[10:21] come he answered them and said the
[10:24] kingdom of God cometh not with
[10:26] observation neither shall they say lo
[10:28] here or lo there for behold the kingdom
[10:31] of God is within you
[10:33] all right and he said unto the disciples
[10:37] the days will come no he's talking about
[10:41] and he described the Holy Ghost being in
[10:43] you talking to them right there now look
[10:46] what he's saying the days will come when
[10:49] you shall desire to see the days of the
[10:53] Son of Man and you shall not see it they
[10:57] shall say to you see hear or see they're
[11:01] going on after them or follow them
[11:04] whereas the Lightning that lighteth out
[11:07] of the one part under heaven shine us
[11:12] unto the other part under heaven as so
[11:16] shield also this is coming shall also
[11:18] the Son of Man be in his day
[11:21] now I want to keep that one so rocks in
[11:24] his day the son of man in a day but
[11:28] first must be must he suffer many now
[11:31] going back and what he's going to do and
[11:33] be rejected of the generation and as it
[11:36] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[11:39] be in the days of the son of man they
[11:42] shall eat they drank they married wives
[11:43] they were given in marriage until the
[11:46] day that Noah entered into the ark and
[11:49] the flood came calling all the way back
[11:51] through the Bible coming back up right
[11:53] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[11:55] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[11:58] they drank they bought they sold they
[12:00] planted they build him but the same day
[12:04] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[12:06] fire and brimstone from heaven
[12:08] and destroyed them all no even thus
[12:13] shall it be in the day when the Son of
[12:15] Man is revealed all right you may be
[12:21] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[12:23] reading of the word now what I want you
[12:26] to think about because that's what I had
[12:28] on the on the service prior that talking
[12:36] about because I'm still on the quotes
[12:40] just because that have them and they
[12:43] have them back there they don't have to
[12:44] fill up some new ones because we just
[12:46] picked from what we're doing I want to
[12:48] preach really basically the same message
[12:51] but in a little different form
[12:53] now the licen s is my point was that you
[12:59] have son of man son of God son of David
[13:02] okay that's the three sons night okay
[13:06] son of man was the Old Testament right
[13:12] now we're beginning back there the son
[13:15] of man the Old Testament which was what
[13:19] the father right son of man God Himself
[13:26] the Creator the son of man was the word
[13:31] right that created all things and come
[13:35] down and it kept creating kept bringing
[13:37] forth and then it as it came in to the
[13:41] prophets see they were used maybe a
[13:44] little bit to start with but then they
[13:46] said well we don't want the prophets to
[13:48] speak anymore you know I mean we don't
[13:51] want God to speaking of what we want the
[13:52] prophets to speak all right so he
[13:55] designed a way to bring it and brought
[13:57] it through Moses and brought it out into
[14:00] the understanding okay my point then was
[14:03] what son of man son of God son of David
[14:08] son of man was father prophets creator
[14:14] son of God baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[14:18] new birth alright son of David
[14:22] he is in the millennial reign to the
[14:25] Jews
[14:26] alright now so we covered that those Old
[14:30] Testaments prophets they said thus saith
[14:34] the Lord because that was the father
[14:36] speaking through them that was God
[14:38] Himself with I used that word father and
[14:41] into the basis of where you'll keep it
[14:43] in mind because I'm trying to click that
[14:45] little spot in the human brain that
[14:47] makes it remember a few little things
[14:50] all right and that one thing is that
[14:53] that word was the Creator God all right
[14:59] and that was the son of man all right
[15:04] because what did it what is it it is the
[15:08] rising of the Sun doesn't want to do
[15:09] where brother Adam said you know that
[15:12] heart is or who is this on a man he said
[15:14] in the beginning was the word Word was
[15:16] with God and the Word was God
[15:18] all right but then he went on to say and
[15:20] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[15:23] us all right now so pick up the point
[15:26] now son of man was the creator god the
[15:32] great eternal the kingdom of the what we
[15:35] would call the father's kingdom are the
[15:38] time back there under the Old Testament
[15:40] that he would be dealing with the father
[15:42] in the basis of doing he wouldn't be
[15:44] dealing with the son because nobody
[15:48] didn't get to baptism when the Holy
[15:49] Ghost back there he wouldn't be dealing
[15:51] with son of David so the Old Testament
[15:55] was dealing basically with son of man
[15:58] all right son of man God Himself
[16:02] speaking through those men using the
[16:06] prophets to say thus saith the Lord
[16:08] all right you know bringing it to that
[16:11] basis to work that it was God speaking
[16:14] through the prophets and that would be
[16:17] his kingdom that he was dwelling therein
[16:21] was the word to make flesh all right now
[16:26] all right take that point now and keep
[16:28] what I'm saying and then we'll go back
[16:30] and reread some of the quotes where that
[16:32] you'll see it tie together the
[16:36] the the Jehovah the Old Testament was
[16:42] that Jehovah God the Creator God the the
[16:47] I am that created all things but it was
[16:51] the word that done the creating so keep
[16:53] that in mind and then you won't have any
[16:55] problems when you'll read where the
[16:56] Prophet said and even Scofield brings it
[16:59] out that that the Sun is what was the
[17:02] Creator
[17:03] see he could he could read those things
[17:06] and see it and see what was happening
[17:08] back there alright it kept creating kept
[17:11] coming through and and the prophets
[17:13] would say thus saith the Lord John and
[17:15] it would come through and dwelt all the
[17:17] way through the Old Testament as son of
[17:19] man all right then it came that the Son
[17:23] of man came into human flesh that very
[17:28] word that very father that very God
[17:32] Himself was coming down to dwell in
[17:36] human flesh alright now bringing forth
[17:41] the child bringing forth the child that
[17:43] would come forth later but the Creator
[17:46] that would create a body to come and
[17:49] live in all right and he would bring
[17:52] that down and bring it to her there
[17:55] stood on earth then John 1:1 in the
[17:57] beginning was the word Word was with God
[17:59] the Word was God
[18:00] then verse 14 and the Word was made
[18:02] flesh and dwelt among us what word was
[18:05] made flesh the great eternal Jehovah God
[18:08] himself see not another person but the
[18:14] very Jehovah God himself he now comes
[18:17] down into human flesh now I watched my
[18:21] point as we try to hold it
[18:23] see those prophets they were ice on a
[18:27] van but decent of man would speak
[18:31] through them and they'd say thus saith
[18:33] the Lord
[18:34] alright see and then being a son of man
[18:38] then that would mean that God was
[18:40] dwelling in flesh okay back to the Old
[18:45] Testament he was dwelling in the flesh
[18:47] of those prophets
[18:49] until he could come down enough to
[18:51] remember remember we're covered till
[18:54] when he come to Moses it comes into a
[18:56] greater portion of things because Moses
[19:00] didn't say thus saith the Lord a lot of
[19:03] times he got to the basis of just saying
[19:05] it in in things because that would be
[19:08] speaking of what was coming to be made
[19:12] manifest all right
[19:14] showing that the son of man would come
[19:16] into flesh the son of man would come
[19:20] into human flesh all right the Lord
[19:22] Jesus Christ was the son of man Moses
[19:26] was just a son of man but the Lord Jesus
[19:30] was the son of man stepping forth in
[19:33] human flesh all right now watch my point
[19:37] now see then that son of man would be
[19:40] dealing with the Word made flesh I want
[19:45] you to get that into your mind and drive
[19:46] this little cat down because that's what
[19:49] I've always preached and what I've
[19:50] always believed now that it's not one
[19:54] person it can't be the son of man can't
[19:57] be one person no more that he ended it
[20:00] in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[20:03] be the one person all right
[20:05] from then on it would be into a multiple
[20:07] form or a group or a bride or a church
[20:10] there have been that I've been talking
[20:12] about all right see then it would be to
[20:16] the basis that something was transpiring
[20:20] more in the coming forth of the Lord
[20:23] Jesus than maybe what we think about
[20:25] because dar was the word itself made
[20:29] flesh in the human body the word made a
[20:34] flesh to step into that was fine all
[20:38] right by creating the word itself see
[20:41] then his body would be a human element
[20:45] okay now listen one saying show us what
[20:49] he was going to do there whatever what
[20:52] he done there he's going to do in the
[20:54] entire bride I've never preached that
[20:59] nobody no one man can't be what I'm
[21:01] talking about the Lord's he
[21:02] Christ he is yes God himself is that but
[21:06] not no human elements isn't nothing but
[21:08] as a body of Jesus Christ we're in the
[21:13] days of the manifestation now we can
[21:20] cover all of it son of man son of God
[21:23] son today that we've been through it up
[21:25] and down but we're in the day of the
[21:27] full manifestation of the Word of God
[21:33] the Son of Man Jesus Christ dwelling in
[21:40] his church he said what that's too
[21:44] strong now it ain't strong enough they
[21:49] think about what you're talking what
[21:51] you're what I've been trying to get you
[21:53] to see see the son of man was the Word
[21:57] made flesh right the prophets would
[22:00] stand out and say thus saith the LORD
[22:02] until it was so much so close to him
[22:04] until they'd how to veil Moses face and
[22:07] all kind of things would have to be for
[22:10] those people and they would speak the
[22:12] Word of God but one day that God stepped
[22:17] on earth all right now where did he step
[22:21] he stepped into human flesh right so
[22:28] he'd become John one in the beginning
[22:29] was the word Word was with God and the
[22:31] Word was God
[22:32] taking to all of the Old Testament all
[22:34] of the Creator all of the things of the
[22:37] Old Testament about Jehovah and being
[22:39] showing the father himself the Creator
[22:43] standing forth and bringing the word
[22:45] which was the son to bring the word all
[22:48] right
[22:48] now in doing that then his his plan and
[22:54] purpose was to come and live in human
[22:57] flesh all right now listen what I'm
[23:01] talking about you know yourself that
[23:04] most of the time you think about God
[23:06] coming to live in human flesh was that
[23:09] he came down to release the life that
[23:12] was in the flesh that's well good
[23:16] and that's okay well and good call this
[23:17] through he did come down to offer up
[23:21] that flesh but had he not come in flesh
[23:25] he couldn't come forth to do the
[23:28] redemptive right there have been no
[23:32] redemption so you got to take everything
[23:34] and put it under son of man because
[23:37] really son of man in the whole Bible
[23:39] ties together everything thing all right
[23:44] and that was what I was trying to get
[23:45] across her last week was to make sure
[23:48] you see that all of those prophets were
[23:51] God in another form but yet not the D
[23:57] son of man because it would not dwell in
[24:00] just one but they were God in another
[24:06] form Moses because that's what Jesus
[24:09] said he said you call them gods that the
[24:13] word come to and he said that is right
[24:15] that is right those prophets were so
[24:21] close to God until God was in that
[24:23] prophet living and and speaking forth
[24:27] but he was in a human element that had a
[24:32] beginning and and sin had entered the
[24:35] picture and etc so that couldn't be used
[24:39] to do that part see there was no way you
[24:43] or I could do anything to save each
[24:45] other one couldn't die for the other do
[24:48] any good now but Jesus Christ could come
[24:51] live on earth become now listen what I'm
[24:54] saying become the Word made flesh and
[24:59] then he could give his life to release
[25:03] that that was within him okay released
[25:09] that that was within him then to get us
[25:13] salvation for the Soul
[25:15] but you still got a problem with the
[25:17] body see one day you're going to realize
[25:23] what I'm talking about I'm done by the
[25:24] rapture and and
[25:27] and resurrection and they down here in
[25:30] low enough turns until if you're not
[25:33] careful you'll miss what I'm saying see
[25:37] your resurrection is inside of you your
[25:41] rapture is inside of you it is that new
[25:45] birth it is that baptism of the Holy
[25:47] Ghost all right but we've got to get
[25:50] some way to bring it back to flesh and I
[25:54] know I've tried to preach this for years
[25:56] and people you know they ain't saying
[25:59] they don't understand I'm just saying
[26:00] it's been a hard thing to try to preach
[26:03] that you can't go from Son of Man the
[26:07] Son of God the Son of David you can't go
[26:12] that way see the Prophet went from Son
[26:17] of Man the Son of God down through the
[26:21] ages then in the last part of the life
[26:23] stage he comes back to Son of Man and
[26:26] then he says now we can go to son of
[26:28] David see if you don't come back to that
[26:31] son of man in this day just prior to the
[26:34] change there's not going to be ashamed
[26:36] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[26:39] I'm trying to get you to see the very
[26:42] key of all of the understanding of the
[26:44] Bible lays in the fact to be able to
[26:46] understand the Son of Man and what's
[26:49] transpiring what's taking place wasn't
[26:51] what's being done and see there through
[26:55] the Old Testament those prophets would
[26:57] say to us saith the Lord and it would
[27:01] even come up to Moses until he'd move in
[27:04] closer than the other prophets and he
[27:07] would actually speak and then even like
[27:11] day vigilant see 108 they pierced my
[27:13] hands and my feet and time where David
[27:15] would actually so come and get so
[27:18] involved in what he was doing till it he
[27:20] would be talking like himself you
[27:23] remember and that's what the man asked
[27:25] under Oh in the book of Acts or
[27:27] something is this man talking about
[27:29] himself or another they because there
[27:32] was those men that were so used until
[27:35] they would be speaking of what would
[27:38] happen but yet still no matter how what
[27:41] they were they couldn't do anything to
[27:44] redeem the man so here God had to come
[27:49] into human flesh huh he couldn't have
[27:54] stepped out on earth and regained the
[27:56] man he had to come in human flesh to be
[28:00] able to number one release that soul
[28:03] that being part of him that could come
[28:05] back on you and I in the new birth all
[28:10] right
[28:11] but he had to redeem that body what if
[28:15] he had not to redeemed his own body he
[28:18] said you mean his guardian yeah his body
[28:19] was a creation in flames the creation
[28:22] got a beginning is you've got an ending
[28:25] to it
[28:26] alright see are you following me
[28:29] see then the son of man when he stepped
[28:32] on earth then he truly was verse 14 of
[28:37] John and the word was made flesh not to
[28:45] just say the word made of flesh the word
[28:49] itself was made flesh and dwelt among us
[28:53] you say are you expecting that to be in
[28:55] the end time yes but never to be in one
[28:58] person well can't happen in one person
[29:03] what I've preached for 40 some years I
[29:06] see it right now some but it can't be in
[29:08] one person I don't care who it is you me
[29:10] or who do you think it is it can't be
[29:13] done in one person the bride herself
[29:19] becomes the fullness of the Godhead
[29:22] bodily the Prophet said how is that to
[29:25] happen that's why I've always tried to
[29:31] preach it to you who the Son of Man
[29:32] really is
[29:35] Jesus was the flesh land that God
[29:39] inhabited
[29:40] to live on earth right but yet that
[29:44] flesh had to do a redemptive we wasn't
[29:49] ten folks to God in spirit
[29:53] no we're kinfolks to God by the
[29:57] redemptive power of the blessings that
[30:00] he redeemed us through the fact of
[30:03] giving his life yes coming to live in
[30:07] you and I to redeem us but he went right
[30:11] on and brother Brown said he lay claim
[30:13] go to future home city laid claim right
[30:16] dark write their own Calvary he lay
[30:21] claim to our bodies but he had to wait
[30:27] awhile and then it would have to be come
[30:29] back in the end time to come back to the
[30:32] son of man listen to what I'm trying to
[30:36] say and get it rightly to understand if
[30:40] there is no son of man in the end time
[30:43] there is no redemptive power for the
[30:46] change of the body so we're going to
[30:49] keep going by the grave until somebody
[30:54] realized what's taking place you say
[30:57] yeah but you you're making it tortoise
[30:59] I'm making it the worse a whole group of
[31:01] people never to one individual but a
[31:04] random I gave you the quotes on a will
[31:05] read them in a minute where he said a
[31:06] universal Church a universal mean all
[31:14] over the whole world and four brings it
[31:19] down as to being the bride you mean that
[31:24] we're gonna have something to do with
[31:25] the redemption yes see but brother
[31:30] branham coming to bring the message is
[31:32] not the fullness of the son of man I
[31:36] said it the way I meant it he's not the
[31:38] fullness he's part of it he's part of
[31:43] the body of Christ but he's not the
[31:47] fullness of it but neither I mean you it
[31:51] takes all of us together not just one
[31:55] person or one little group of Lula i'ts
[32:00] no it takes a bride around the world
[32:06] Jesus Christ was the flesh man that God
[32:11] came himself God was in Christ
[32:14] reconciling the world unto himself God
[32:17] came down into human flesh making that
[32:22] man the son of man not a son of man not
[32:28] just to be a prophet even though he was
[32:31] a prophet he was the greatest of all
[32:33] prophets but he was the king of the
[32:34] prophets see if you can look back and
[32:39] see those prophets could be called as
[32:41] Jesus said him the cinammon ago jesus
[32:43] said you called the prophets God he said
[32:46] one of you condemned me to say that I'm
[32:47] a son of God see they knew when he said
[32:52] that he was son of God that son of God
[32:54] would God in human flesh they were
[32:58] smarter than your thing they knew what
[33:00] he was saying they didn't kill him for
[33:02] him making little statements they killed
[33:05] him when he was making the statements
[33:07] that they knew what he was talking about
[33:10] he was telling them he was God in human
[33:13] flesh and that's who that was God in
[33:19] human flesh
[33:19] what is the bride to be in the last days
[33:21] you'll see what I've always tried to
[33:23] preach the bride is to be God in human
[33:26] flesh
[33:28] that's all I've tried to get you to see
[33:31] about us and what we are 47 years
[33:34] preaching it that away to believe it
[33:36] about the son of man they see Jesus was
[33:42] God in human flesh are a flesh man the
[33:48] God revealing himself to mankind in
[33:55] mankind or in flesh that's what Jesus
[34:01] was doing he was revealing God in flesh
[34:05] see that's what I said about them they
[34:07] wasn't dummies they knew what he was
[34:09] saying they knew when he said that I'm
[34:13] the son of God they knew better than to
[34:17] think about a Trinity
[34:18] they wouldn't even though when he was
[34:22] saying I'm the son of God they knew he
[34:25] was saying that he was God in human
[34:28] flesh
[34:28] because today what is the child of God
[34:30] you realize by that Newberg that you
[34:35] have you're a child of God your God made
[34:41] manifest in another form called a bride
[34:47] that's all I've ever tried to preach all
[34:49] I've ever tried to get us to see if we
[34:54] can just see what the Bible is saying
[34:57] about us and see son of God is spirit
[35:03] God right
[35:07] son of David is God over the earth and
[35:11] the ruler of humanities and everything
[35:14] you know he's in full control into that
[35:17] son of David sure he's connected to the
[35:21] Jews and they'll be into that part sit
[35:23] on the throne and they'll be there right
[35:26] but he's the son of man if he couldn't
[35:30] come back I said if he couldn't come
[35:32] back code I believe he's come back now
[35:36] I'll get to that in a minute I don't
[35:37] believe brother Branham is God no way
[35:39] but there's one thing about it he's so
[35:41] close to it because if it took a veil
[35:45] over Moses's face for them to be able to
[35:50] stand in his presence
[35:51] no wonder the people couldn't understand
[35:53] brother Branham no wonder they made him
[35:55] God no wonder they tried to worship him
[35:57] and all of the things why because it was
[36:01] no close so close to being God in human
[36:08] flesh bring him back to Ehsan a man and
[36:13] keep him in that situation and you bring
[36:15] back now listen here on won't get to
[36:18] point that it took me 40 years to try to
[36:20] preach think the bride will be the son
[36:23] of man but you put her in flesh and
[36:27] stand without of him she's a son of man
[36:29] he's the son of mine
[36:32] ain't doing away with him
[36:34] don't-don't-don't never think that I'm
[36:35] trying to do away with him put it all
[36:37] over into her uh-huh
[36:39] no no it's not all into her you got to
[36:44] keep him here he's the one but he is the
[36:48] son of man but when he comes now he's in
[36:52] the bride form in this dispensational
[36:56] part right now he's in bride form Church
[37:01] ages made away right son of man made a
[37:06] way for son of God to come into church
[37:08] aid he gave his life he relinquished the
[37:11] life out of his human flesh and the
[37:15] flesh went to the grave and had to be
[37:16] redeemed not because it was sinful no
[37:19] well cause it was a creation it had a
[37:22] beginning all right
[37:24] son of man made way for son of God son
[37:28] of God makes wafers not a man because
[37:30] son of God is to return back to the
[37:32] original word right that's why the
[37:38] Prophet had to come
[37:39] that's why Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 all of
[37:42] those had to follow back it had to be a
[37:44] prophet coming this day do you see this
[37:51] you go that away you go that away you
[37:54] miss it either way brother Branham was
[37:58] not God but he was as close as it'll
[38:03] ever be as far as human elements because
[38:08] God was using him all right the son of
[38:14] man was using a son of man in our day
[38:17] I never made brother Branham the son of
[38:19] man I've always talked out the testicle
[38:21] incorrect you can't make right around
[38:23] them at least on a man no but the son of
[38:29] man come through that flesh to till
[38:32] actually it what I told you there Sunday
[38:34] if you've listening if you'll go back
[38:36] and listen when you hear me say it keep
[38:38] this in the correct line with Moses and
[38:42] you can look at mo
[38:43] and see that Moses was God to the people
[38:49] the Bible says that says you'll be God
[38:53] error be your prophet
[38:56] that's why when Moses would come up he'd
[38:59] said Aaron Aaron would say just say if
[39:02] the Lord go down the rod this thing
[39:04] happen well cuz there and hate he had to
[39:07] have a prophet he had to have a voice
[39:10] because that was what they wanted was
[39:14] somebody to speak he knew that would
[39:16] come forth in the time so they were they
[39:19] were doing him but get what I'm saying
[39:20] then yeah but Moses himself was so close
[39:26] into that position until brother Brown
[39:29] said it he said I couldn't understand
[39:32] how Moses could tell God a better way of
[39:33] doing that he said until I see it was
[39:35] Christ in Moses who was that in standing
[39:40] there on the earth God in human flesh
[39:44] but his name was Moses why because he
[39:49] was in a natural flesh as long as you
[39:52] keep that natural flesh don't you worry
[39:53] about it
[39:54] don't let that natural flesh ever ride
[39:56] up too much look it won't work all right
[40:00] but listen let's not of man all right
[40:11] he's God in human flesh in Jesus Christ
[40:18] the prophets were a son of man which was
[40:24] being God using them but inside of them
[40:28] was not the dwelling of the Holy Spirit
[40:30] as a new birth right you see why we've
[40:35] spent so much time over the years trying
[40:37] to get you to understand that be careful
[40:42] with that how you carry it let's see but
[40:46] it's so close till Moses could actually
[40:48] stand there and speak or write the Bible
[40:51] right
[40:56] yet he was not the God of the Bible he
[40:58] couldn't die for your sins me so you
[41:04] came you always got to keep him like Son
[41:05] of Man but when you come to the finality
[41:09] of this day it can't be just a son of
[41:13] man if you can get God back in human
[41:17] flesh
[41:18] you've got the son of man and I'm
[41:22] talking about God in your flesh and my
[41:25] flesh I'm talking about going further
[41:28] than just this point of saying we're
[41:31] born again at faith I'm talking about
[41:32] statue of a perfect man going on out
[41:35] adoptions all of the things is bringing
[41:38] it into reality that's a bride not just
[41:45] three quarters of it and see I'm not
[41:48] putting nothing out because if you
[41:50] understand what I'm saying listen this
[41:51] is well touted and always hot you can't
[41:53] just make it to bride in the end time
[41:56] that bride all the way back back from
[42:01] the book of Acts back from the first
[42:04] church age
[42:05] that's the bride to me that's the one of
[42:09] standing in Revelations one Girt about
[42:13] the paps with a golden girl that's that
[42:16] one back there it takes all of the bride
[42:20] across in every church age I'm not
[42:27] saying that one individual at one church
[42:29] age or one thing can be no I've never
[42:31] taught it that way you may have thought
[42:33] it but it's not being because it's got
[42:37] to be the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[42:39] so you can't make the life stage listen
[42:42] you can't make the life stage the
[42:44] fullness of the Godhead bodily without
[42:46] bringing it through seven Church ages
[42:49] then you can talk about fullness of the
[42:51] Godhead bodily when you put all the
[42:54] church ages together and bring out all
[42:57] of them in what they're supposed to be
[42:59] bringing we get down through those ages
[43:02] there was not any of those that were
[43:04] dealing with the the redemption of the
[43:07] body the great Apostle Paul was a great
[43:10] of all but yet he still had questions
[43:11] and thoughts he didn't he could talk
[43:14] about changes he could talk about those
[43:16] things but he couldn't bring it into
[43:17] manifestation right he knew it was the
[43:24] future thing he knew what he was saying
[43:29] would come in the future now we're here
[43:34] see now the bride realizing who she is
[43:39] Luther name might not understood who
[43:41] they were but they were part of the body
[43:43] of Christ and I am in no way talking
[43:46] about a son of man that's being in the
[43:48] seventh Church a juror or a bride age or
[43:51] some kind of something like that I've
[43:52] never taught nothing like that
[43:54] it takes all of the entire bride down
[43:58] through seven Church ages to come out
[44:00] and then you got the bride age that
[44:02] comes into manifestation the bride age
[44:06] that comes into manifestation is when
[44:07] that man stands out in what is it
[44:13] Leviticus 25 we're talking about the
[44:19] have a house it stated Leviticus 25
[44:22] because it covers right down under were
[44:24] the sounding of the trumpet and all the
[44:27] tents tents verse and coming down to the
[44:30] complete plan of redemption the fifty or
[44:32] through the 49 that there's a there's a
[44:34] church age messenger in this forty ninth
[44:36] we had a man in this message I mean a
[44:39] man in this day that was not the
[44:41] messenger to the lady or CEO he said I'm
[44:43] not said you'll make me a lady Oh seeing
[44:45] you say yeah but he was preaching to
[44:47] them back there now his message he had
[44:51] to restore he had to restore all of
[44:56] those things before his message could be
[44:58] brought his message begun in the seals
[45:01] because that was the message Moses
[45:04] brought to the people that wrote the
[45:06] five books from are you following me you
[45:09] getting the point
[45:10] see you got to get something to worry
[45:13] that can deal with flesh the Lord Jesus
[45:19] Christ was God made manifest in
[45:23] human flesh called the son of man that's
[45:30] what he said who the man say i the son
[45:31] of man am my brother Ron said he never
[45:35] declared himself to be son of God said
[45:37] he always would declare himself to be
[45:38] Son of Man because that was what it
[45:43] would be to work would come forth well
[45:45] wouldn't it come forth in the end time
[45:47] what's your problem with with coming
[45:49] forth in the end time to see that God
[45:52] brought us a profit and that profit was
[45:55] so close he was just like Moses he was
[45:58] so close until you'd have to veil his
[46:00] face because he didn't you'd start
[46:02] worshiping the messenger instead of the
[46:05] message I believe the messenger and the
[46:09] message is one I don't believe the
[46:11] messenger by itself is one you bring the
[46:15] message and you get it into reality
[46:18] listen the son of man was in the Old
[46:26] Testament and would be the eternal God
[46:28] appearing in the prophets to bring forth
[46:33] the word alright
[46:35] Moses did not now listen to the point
[46:37] and you'll see why that you can't put
[46:39] the fullness all in one thing even
[46:41] though Moses wrote five books he could
[46:44] not bring it forth into manifestation
[46:47] all right and writing the five books
[46:52] they you would be leaving out the word
[46:57] coming in flesh because you'd be dealing
[47:01] with that looking at that trying to make
[47:03] that two word flesh you know Moses don't
[47:06] do that come on down Moses just spoke of
[47:10] the coming of the Son of Man the Lord
[47:14] Jesus Christ and he spoke of the coming
[47:17] of the bride not see those prophets were
[47:24] the flesh yes they were the flesh that
[47:30] God would use and God could use brother
[47:34] Branham in such a mighty way until
[47:36] it would be hard to tell the difference
[47:38] between him and and the God that was
[47:40] doing I agree with that I mean I I see
[47:43] people I don't make that garden to be
[47:45] there but I see people that hold her
[47:47] confidence so much in to brother branham
[47:49] and thinking he's gone but you can't do
[47:52] that what you're making part of the body
[47:56] of Christ cuz that's what he is then you
[48:02] can start talking about the Son of Man
[48:04] because this one Noah
[48:06] the bride is not complete let's see let
[48:08] me see let me state it in my way now
[48:10] God is not completely not you
[48:12] understanding the run said God is not
[48:14] complete without you alright so there's
[48:17] something that's got to be into me and
[48:19] you alright do you realize then that
[48:21] brother Browns not complete without you
[48:26] but now let me say it again
[48:29] you're not complete without him you know
[48:33] one come by we're not complete without
[48:35] brother Branham he's the one that
[48:36] brought the message it's putting it into
[48:39] the order of trying to show that it's
[48:41] not God that we're looking at it's God
[48:44] in a man it's a flesh that was yielded
[48:49] so unto the God could come and live in
[48:51] that flesh I believe that will happen
[48:54] again onto a bride of Jesus Christ maybe
[48:56] for a short period right maybe it'll be
[49:00] evil like brother Brian said said give
[49:03] me a church full of the Holy Ghost and
[49:05] God will do in one year what theologians
[49:07] tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing
[49:09] it now see you realize you ever think
[49:14] about what you're facing right now now
[49:18] listen for a minute I'm not gonna try to
[49:20] preach nothing out of the word to try to
[49:23] get it but I'm trying to get you to see
[49:24] something you realize right now what's
[49:27] taking place
[49:34] the churches are not attacking the
[49:37] baptism when the Holy Ghost mm-hmm these
[49:43] demons are not attacking the baptism
[49:45] when the hell ago they know better that
[49:48] virus I can't pronounce the word for it
[49:51] so I called it virus but that virus is
[49:56] attacking you were flesh come on it's a
[50:06] contact disease right it's got to house
[50:13] something even if it's sneezing - mucus
[50:17] or something coming out and and you and
[50:20] you standing beside of somebody and they
[50:23] sneeze and you get your disease it's
[50:26] still a fleshly disease isn't that odd
[50:31] getting it odd - these diseases that
[50:34] acting right when the bride is being
[50:36] taught that what out and I'm saying it
[50:38] do what you want - I've been teaching
[50:40] this 40 years so don't worried about you
[50:43] thinking I'm on get exalted cuz I ain't
[50:45] concerned about that but I am saying one
[50:47] thing I have taught this 40 years over
[50:50] over over over to get us ready and now
[50:52] here we are facing a disease that is
[50:56] attacking the flesh why because the
[51:00] bride is beginning to see who she really
[51:03] is
[51:04] that she's God in human flesh then
[51:10] whatever we've got God give it to us it
[51:14] is he that have made us not we ourselves
[51:21] do you realize what I'm talking about
[51:23] you realize what I've been trying to say
[51:25] for all of these years but never been
[51:30] invited to do so anywhere to come and
[51:33] preach yet maybe one message opportunity
[51:37] and then I'm gone I can't do it because
[51:39] I'll try to preach it a little bit of
[51:40] something and the first thing you know
[51:42] that I'm not invited no more and that's
[51:44] no problem I understand I
[51:47] stand one thing for sure if God had to
[51:50] reveal to me the Son of Man the bride
[51:52] being the son of man and putting it in
[51:54] the correct way that not to be a son of
[51:56] I mean to be a son of man that the son
[51:58] of man would be living in but would be
[52:00] the Word made flesh and that's what I
[52:02] taught in 1969 and I believed that I've
[52:07] not been upsetting hard about anybody
[52:10] that don't want to believe it because if
[52:11] a card came and they don't reveal it to
[52:13] you you can't see it you can't see it
[52:19] unless God reveals it right now his
[52:24] honest this can be even after he reveals
[52:26] it sometimes it gets pretty rough
[52:31] because you're trying to look at too
[52:33] much flesh and then you wind up trying
[52:38] to whoop the flesh in the line it's not
[52:42] whooping the flesh in the line if the
[52:44] word that will come to redeem the flesh
[52:49] the Holy Ghost is supposed to put the
[52:52] word in flesh in line the body right
[52:58] that we present our bodies as a living
[53:00] sacrifice holy and acceptable under God
[53:03] see that's what we've got to do with
[53:05] what he's done for us knowing that we're
[53:10] standing here facing all of these things
[53:14] knowing that we're hearing the endtime
[53:16] with all of these things happening and
[53:19] I'm not scaring nobody that it ain't
[53:21] gonna scare you anyway I've never tried
[53:28] to scare anybody with what I thought you
[53:30] know what I taught I love this not what
[53:32] I believe I've always believed that the
[53:36] bride a complete bride not a singlet not
[53:40] meaning a few or Allu lights or
[53:43] something
[53:43] some group know it's all over the whole
[53:45] world and it's all back down through
[53:47] seven churches ages all the way back it
[53:53] takes all of them to come forth and be
[53:56] the son of man
[54:02] didn't they realize what was taking
[54:04] place the Martin Luther you think about
[54:10] him that is he he he went out there with
[54:13] that knee and he he was a good man he
[54:16] was he was a you know as we called it
[54:18] converted under the times of the days
[54:22] and the things within God spoke to him
[54:25] and said to just shall live by faith and
[54:30] he wrote right beside of it they say
[54:32] alone the just shall live by faith alone
[54:38] ain't gonna live by nothing else he
[54:42] didn't want to come out of the Catholic
[54:44] Church I got his own ridings at home he
[54:47] wanted to convert to church he was doing
[54:50] everything he could to try to convert to
[54:52] church he didn't do what didn't try to
[54:55] do away with the communions and the
[54:57] things they were doing back there he
[54:58] wanted them to be correct he wanted all
[55:01] that to be but when he realized that
[55:06] they were not acting what he was a
[55:08] saying they were going out and burning
[55:10] down buildings and saying Luther told us
[55:12] to do this he didn't do that he was
[55:16] trying to get him converted that's right
[55:22] that's what I say all right Jesus was
[55:27] the Word made flesh a man walking on the
[55:32] earth in human flesh all right now take
[55:38] that entire Jesus Christ because each
[55:41] age is a part of Jesus Christ each
[55:43] individual is a part of Jesus Christ
[55:46] you know born-again believers and put
[55:49] all that together and what do you got in
[55:53] the last days the son of man the word
[56:03] my flesh how much did the Prophet speak
[56:09] on the word being my flesh how much did
[56:12] he speak about how the word the bride
[56:14] had to become the word I asked you to
[56:20] even discern any type just go home pick
[56:22] out a tape stick it in and you'll hear
[56:24] him saying something about what I'm
[56:27] talking about
[56:29] the redemptions the salvations the
[56:32] things because that's what he's always
[56:35] talked listen see the son of man was in
[56:42] the Old Testament right through those
[56:45] prophets and times Jehovah God using the
[56:49] prophets to do the things even using
[56:52] them to create as Moses then he appears
[56:58] in human flesh walking on the shores of
[57:01] Galilee right then in it odd the to
[57:15] Bible says they without us should not be
[57:20] made perfect they without us that's what
[57:29] I've drove that driving
[57:30] I believe that Luther was standing here
[57:35] today he'd say that's what I was talking
[57:37] about when I preach the just shall live
[57:39] by faith that's exactly what I was
[57:41] talking about Oh God living in human
[57:45] flesh in a people he rejoiced with the
[57:50] Holy Ghost that was within him but
[57:51] waiting the redemption of the body
[57:54] that's what all has done but you don't
[58:00] catch it let me say it one more time
[58:02] then it's in it so odd that in the Old
[58:05] Testament the son of man God Himself was
[58:13] finally produced
[58:16] no and listen what did the Prophet say
[58:19] he said the prophets built the body body
[58:24] body that's flesh all right the prophets
[58:32] built the body that walked on the shores
[58:34] of Galilee we call Jesus because they
[58:38] were the word and he was the word all
[58:42] right and he walks on the shores of
[58:45] Galilee as God in human flesh
[58:48] because that's what happened I agree
[58:51] with the River Jordan if they'll get it
[58:53] in the right order brother branham said
[58:55] it listen a lot of the times as I but
[58:58] you get it in the right order right
[59:01] because if you don't you get it all out
[59:03] all messed up he stood there on the
[59:07] River Jordan and the Holy Ghost came on
[59:09] him under-19 came upon the Lord Jesus
[59:13] Christ the Brethren said made him the
[59:15] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[59:18] not if he wasn't God before the end he
[59:22] was Almighty God or he couldn't come to
[59:24] that place he was already the word but
[59:32] that anointing that came on him they
[59:34] could not touch that body they couldn't
[59:37] kill him
[59:38] until it was done and finished - what
[59:41] that man had to complete then they could
[59:44] kill him what when their mourning left
[59:46] him in the Garden of Gethsemane he went
[59:48] on the Calvary would you want all alike
[59:52] I like the fact the reason that up there
[59:56] in the garden it left him but it's to
[59:59] come in the bride and the end time and
[1:00:04] then to show that she doesn't it were
[1:00:07] brother Branham said the anointing to
[1:00:10] the temple in the Millennium is the
[1:00:15] bride of Jesus Christ he said the
[1:00:17] anointing is up on that people that rods
[1:00:21] back
[1:00:25] we were sitting there life's not
[1:00:27] listening then he said you know we talk
[1:00:29] about the the bride we talk about this
[1:00:31] she said you're a bride dis for one day
[1:00:35] I said then you become his wife
[1:00:41] that covers maturity so the Book of
[1:00:44] Revelations covers what and his wife has
[1:00:48] made herself ready
[1:00:50] revelations not to but it turns right
[1:00:52] around in a verse or two out of them and
[1:00:53] talks about the bride why because it is
[1:00:56] the bride the bride is that one standing
[1:01:00] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:01:01] candlesticks
[1:01:02] lock under the front of them you're
[1:01:04] looking at the bride seeing it odd that
[1:01:10] we're coming down to the message that
[1:01:13] deals exactly with the redemption
[1:01:16] because we're coming back to the
[1:01:18] possibility and showing that in the Old
[1:01:21] Testament it took all the Old Testament
[1:01:24] through all of the prophets that thus
[1:01:25] saith the Lord's all of the things and
[1:01:27] Moses and all of the different things
[1:01:29] getting it ready to wear that it could
[1:01:31] come forth and as it would come forth it
[1:01:34] would be a man walk up on the shores of
[1:01:36] Galilee as a human being that would give
[1:01:43] his life not to just release the Holy
[1:01:45] Ghost to come back because that would
[1:01:47] not be the full redemption of the person
[1:01:49] that would redeem the soul but you've
[1:01:52] got to have the body redeemed he was my
[1:01:56] brother in human flesh he was not
[1:02:00] kinfolks to me until he come into human
[1:02:03] flesh right well you got to keep the
[1:02:10] story running correct then when you get
[1:02:15] the story running correct you'll see all
[1:02:17] the way through the Bible that's coming
[1:02:19] forth with a beautiful picture yes that
[1:02:24] it took all of that Old Testament
[1:02:25] prophets to bring forth one man which
[1:02:30] was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] and then he would have to give his life
[1:02:37] to release the holy ghost it was in him
[1:02:40] yes but he'd have to give his life a
[1:02:44] human flesh ransom that our bodies could
[1:02:49] be redeemed future future home our soul
[1:02:57] is redeemed but said we're waiting the
[1:02:59] redemption of the body isn't it odd that
[1:03:03] the end time then is to have a mystery
[1:03:08] and that's what I read to you last week
[1:03:11] prophet said it's a message a mystery in
[1:03:17] that something that all of these things
[1:03:20] could be put together the word that you
[1:03:23] could see what's going on listen read
[1:03:33] real fast and oh no I don't ask him to
[1:03:35] pull him up but I ran him on the message
[1:03:39] called the trial in these last days as
[1:03:41] son of man making himself known among
[1:03:43] his people in the form of his people
[1:03:49] same message when the Son of man shall
[1:03:52] be revealed son of man being revealed
[1:03:54] not son of God in the church age he's
[1:03:57] put out of that and he son of man
[1:03:59] revealing himself the word is becoming
[1:04:02] flesh among us church we would see Jesus
[1:04:10] Jesus in you tonight until God manifests
[1:04:13] himself in the last days the son of man
[1:04:16] revealing himself in his church the
[1:04:19] human flesh making himself known worthy
[1:04:23] to be made known in this day in human
[1:04:25] flesh your flesh
[1:04:30] there's your Redemption see God down
[1:04:34] here in his church making himself again
[1:04:37] the word the Son of man being revealed
[1:04:38] in the last days the son of man back in
[1:04:41] his church the mighty God unveil back in
[1:04:45] the church again reveal
[1:04:46] in human beings not Son of God but the
[1:04:51] son of man again back in his church
[1:04:53] again in the last days what about it you
[1:04:57] remember these from last week the
[1:05:05] faithful Abraham then the Holy Spirit
[1:05:09] wasn't only in one person it's in the
[1:05:13] entire Church Universal doing the same
[1:05:16] works that Jesus did hallelujah I
[1:05:19] challenged the world to believe that and
[1:05:23] you'll see a revival break through this
[1:05:26] country see divine healings and things
[1:05:28] all right crisis the mystery of God
[1:05:30] revealed present himself in fullness of
[1:05:34] the Godhead deity through his church
[1:05:37] have the preeminence in his church oh my
[1:05:40] what the anointed man now the anointed
[1:05:43] people excuse me the anointed man now
[1:05:47] the anointed people oh my to bring back
[1:05:50] the anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:05:52] anointed by wine accepting what Eve
[1:05:56] turned down and Adam Adam coming back in
[1:06:00] the anointing of the word that he said
[1:06:02] my word is he anointed with the word
[1:06:05] what Eve turned down he comes back and
[1:06:08] we accept unveiling of God he came as
[1:06:12] the son of man then after the Holy
[1:06:15] Spirit came he then was the son of God
[1:06:18] God is the spirit he was the Holy Spirit
[1:06:20] son of God and he lived through the
[1:06:23] church ages as son of God now in the
[1:06:25] Millennium he'll be son of David sitting
[1:06:27] upon the throne of his father David he
[1:06:30] is the son of David now and remember
[1:06:32] between the Son of God in the lady of
[1:06:35] Sein age they put him out and in Luke he
[1:06:37] said he would be revealed again as son
[1:06:39] of man the Prophet fulfilling the rest
[1:06:42] of it the scriptures tied together tie
[1:06:45] perfectly together son of man son of God
[1:06:48] son of David what was it it's the same
[1:06:50] God all the time just changing his form
[1:06:52] in morphe he just changes it in the
[1:06:55] great drama - to him he's acting it out
[1:06:59] it is arising in her son who is this son
[1:07:01] of man in the beginning was the word
[1:07:03] words with God and the Word was God and
[1:07:05] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:07:07] us and if that if all the teaching that
[1:07:11] we have the confirmation of the Word of
[1:07:14] God by Word of God by signs by wonders
[1:07:18] we see today that in the book of like
[1:07:21] glucans in the 1730 and all the
[1:07:24] scriptures that that the word again is
[1:07:30] waved over the people that the dead
[1:07:33] traditions of man is dead and the son of
[1:07:35] God is alive again if you see then the
[1:07:39] Prophet brought his message and look
[1:07:41] what happened we say all God was good
[1:07:45] shepherd was in his in his son Christ he
[1:07:50] was the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:07:52] all of God was poured out in Christ all
[1:07:55] that God was was in Christ and all that
[1:07:58] Christ is he poured out on the church
[1:08:01] but you keep refusing it so you don't
[1:08:05] believe it now can't be a nice what come
[1:08:10] on the Patmos vision God was revealed in
[1:08:13] Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now
[1:08:16] worst worst God to be revealed in his
[1:08:19] church with his people in us the same
[1:08:23] spirit the same works the same
[1:08:24] manifestation the same love the same
[1:08:27] forgiveness the same long-suffering
[1:08:29] gentleness patience peace mercy all that
[1:08:33] was in Christ is in the church remember
[1:08:35] keep this in mind all that God was he
[1:08:38] poured into Christ he was the fullness
[1:08:39] of the Godhead bodily all that Christ
[1:08:42] was he poured into the church God above
[1:08:45] us so if he's a fullness we've got
[1:08:47] everybody what does it make us okay
[1:08:49] God's only provided place of worship no
[1:08:52] living among you that brings the entire
[1:08:54] fullness of the Godhead bodily among you
[1:08:57] no denominational ideas no doctrines and
[1:09:01] things of our own
[1:09:02] couldn't do it in Luther's they couldn't
[1:09:04] do it in Pentecostal Wesley but in the
[1:09:06] light in the day when the Son of Man
[1:09:08] will be manifested revealed brought back
[1:09:11] the church together
[1:09:13] with the entire deity of God amongst his
[1:09:16] people the mighty God unveiled before us
[1:09:18] it was God in Christ God in a man the
[1:09:22] fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man
[1:09:24] God in a man now it's God in men the
[1:09:27] fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in
[1:09:29] his entire church manifested himself
[1:09:32] fulfilling his word ok come on then lean
[1:09:36] not you your own understanding God isn't
[1:09:39] complete without you
[1:09:41] he isn't complete without you so if he's
[1:09:45] not complete without us why can't we
[1:09:48] believe we're part of him
[1:09:49] ok the message what was the Holy Ghost
[1:09:52] given for and Christ was the fullness of
[1:09:54] the Godhead bodily all that Jehovah was
[1:09:55] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:09:57] was he poured into the church not into
[1:10:00] one individual but into the entire body
[1:10:04] see that would cover all the way down
[1:10:06] through the church ages all the way
[1:10:07] through fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:10:11] it was poured out on the church okay let
[1:10:17] me stop on that no not continue that
[1:10:20] point because we'll pick it up maybe in
[1:10:24] the next message I don't know but I want
[1:10:26] to stop right there because I don't want
[1:10:29] to get your thoughts into too much I
[1:10:32] want you to think about one simple thing
[1:10:34] and we'll go back through it the great
[1:10:41] eternal God wanted to reveal himself to
[1:10:47] mankind so he created man he made him a
[1:10:55] human being
[1:10:57] he put him in the garden give him
[1:11:00] complete control leadership and
[1:11:03] everything whatever Adam would say or do
[1:11:07] God accepted it that was the way it
[1:11:11] would be wind blow prophets save wind
[1:11:14] ceased didn't take place because Adam
[1:11:17] would ask you well yet sin entered the
[1:11:21] picture now look at the point of what
[1:11:24] I've always tried to get you see always
[1:11:26] put something down this way and then put
[1:11:28] it down this way what if Adam and Eve
[1:11:29] had not have sinned well that would have
[1:11:34] been great we would just come for
[1:11:35] remember the tree of life was in the
[1:11:41] garden but also remember the tree of
[1:11:43] knowledge of good and evil was there but
[1:11:45] remember the tree of life was in the
[1:11:46] garden what about Adam and Eve what if
[1:11:50] they did this to come to the point of
[1:11:52] understanding enough to go to that tree
[1:11:55] now we've taught it and we believe it or
[1:11:58] at least I've tried to say it Adam God
[1:12:02] breathed into his nostrils and he become
[1:12:03] a living soul blasphemous names
[1:12:05] okay so then Eve would have had to been
[1:12:07] part of Adam in theophany thigh so that
[1:12:10] since she was been eternal in her soul
[1:12:12] when she was created okay but they
[1:12:15] wouldn't eternal in their flesh what the
[1:12:19] tree was there they could have went to
[1:12:22] that tree but Satan before they got to
[1:12:26] the tree he entered the picture and
[1:12:28] perverted their minds and her thinking
[1:12:30] all right because they'd have made it to
[1:12:33] that tree the Bible says let's you know
[1:12:36] let's put them for lest they partake of
[1:12:40] the tree and they would become as God's
[1:12:42] knowing good and evil I said it couldn't
[1:12:47] happen so then God knew the plan but he
[1:12:50] what did he do he kept Adam and Eve
[1:12:52] pulled it away and sin had entered the
[1:12:56] picture brother branham masterpiece he
[1:12:59] said God didn't quit he said he just
[1:13:02] started over
[1:13:04] he had a masterpiece in the family of
[1:13:06] Adam and Eve in the garden he said sin
[1:13:10] entered the picture and he said he just
[1:13:12] backed out he never killed him told him
[1:13:18] away done everything he just started
[1:13:23] building another masterpiece
[1:13:29] you come forth then you got a jump see
[1:13:32] because you're gonna be able to get the
[1:13:33] two together
[1:13:34] there's Wade's in it now so hold on to
[1:13:36] what he's doing you got a jump to
[1:13:37] Abraham but remember that Abraham is
[1:13:42] what Moses was riding before then but
[1:13:45] don't worry about that just get to
[1:13:47] Abraham right because Abraham was
[1:13:50] showing the complete plan of redemption
[1:13:52] to the change of the body right the full
[1:13:56] redemption even turning back to a young
[1:13:58] man and a young woman the full plan of
[1:14:02] redemption was shown through there all
[1:14:05] right but nobody couldn't understand it
[1:14:06] it couldn't be followed the prophets was
[1:14:09] doing the best they could do so you have
[1:14:10] then a couple of thousand years that the
[1:14:12] prophets would come forth and God would
[1:14:14] speak through them and they would come
[1:14:16] out and they'd say thus saith the Lord
[1:14:18] thus saith the Lord this is to you now
[1:14:22] this is thus saith the Lord and it was
[1:14:24] God speaking to to mankind through
[1:14:27] mankind and bringing it forth all right
[1:14:32] but see then one day those prophets kept
[1:14:36] coming and as they were coming east
[1:14:38] prophets message fit perfectly into the
[1:14:41] puzzle until it brought forth a body or
[1:14:45] a stature if you want to call it you
[1:14:47] know and John the Baptist coming to be
[1:14:50] the last one to introduce the head
[1:14:52] alright he didn't have no thus saith the
[1:14:55] Lord John did have thus said the Lord he
[1:15:02] had the word of the Lord because you'll
[1:15:04] find that he's a tea stone standing
[1:15:06] between the old and the new this is
[1:15:08] exactly the way the Lord Jesus stands in
[1:15:10] a greater way between the old and then
[1:15:12] he the Moses I mean John stood there
[1:15:14] because he introduced behold the lamb of
[1:15:17] God he didn't come out the staff the
[1:15:21] Lord don't know huh he come out speaking
[1:15:23] that word showing what it was to wind up
[1:15:25] all right the Lord Jesus Christ walked
[1:15:29] forth on her God in human flesh
[1:15:32] spends 30 years of his life 33 trying to
[1:15:38] preach a plan of redemption
[1:15:41] even covering how the sower of the seed
[1:15:43] is the son of man that's the son of man
[1:15:46] he never spoke of son of God now he did
[1:15:48] he spoke of him into our brother branham
[1:15:50] will say that he'll say says he wouldn't
[1:15:52] he never referred to himself as son of
[1:15:54] God then either while you'll hear me
[1:15:56] said now now somebody say it now that
[1:15:58] you get it
[1:15:59] he said now somebody said that Jesus
[1:16:03] never called herself son of God he said
[1:16:05] yes he did cuz that's who he was when he
[1:16:09] you think then he forgot or what
[1:16:12] happened he was the one that said that
[1:16:16] he never used son of God he wasn't doing
[1:16:20] it he was trying to put it in the
[1:16:21] correct order you get it all day this
[1:16:23] one puts it in order for this and I all
[1:16:25] right be here is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:27] God in human flesh the son of man what
[1:16:35] about a D son of man stand there and say
[1:16:37] he said the Son of man has power to
[1:16:39] forgive sins
[1:16:44] ain't it kind of odd brother Branham
[1:16:46] come forward in the last days trying to
[1:16:47] get us to see the two bride of Jesus
[1:16:50] Christ standing under the word can
[1:16:54] forgive sin not in the wrong way now but
[1:17:01] in the right way you come with a word
[1:17:04] and it'll work I'm just getting the
[1:17:06] point
[1:17:07] see then when he died he released that
[1:17:10] holy spirit that would come back and
[1:17:11] live in the bride and down through 7
[1:17:14] Church ages you had Son of God
[1:17:15] manifesting himself through mighty
[1:17:17] marvelous things that are that was
[1:17:20] transpiring down through those ages and
[1:17:22] times coming out into the life days and
[1:17:25] all at once as I said brother Brown says
[1:17:32] here he is not a man son of God some
[1:17:35] David he said but just at the ending of
[1:17:38] song God before you can go to the
[1:17:41] Millennium cities comes back for a
[1:17:43] moment that's none of man then you hear
[1:17:46] brother Branham coming forth and what
[1:17:50] was he doing thus saith the Lord
[1:17:54] thus saith the Lord all the way from the
[1:17:57] beginning in his ministry right cuz that
[1:18:01] was God speaking through him but then
[1:18:03] today come he says why cry speak he told
[1:18:10] the Prophet said stop crying and speak
[1:18:11] it and go on why because he had put in
[1:18:15] his hands the ability to speak the word
[1:18:22] what did he speak about you and me
[1:18:27] redemption for you and me what did it
[1:18:31] finish up being the prophet of God
[1:18:35] brought his message but he had to go off
[1:18:39] the scene why because they was making
[1:18:41] him the son of man and that was
[1:18:45] incorrect though
[1:18:52] then you start dealing with this word
[1:18:55] the seals the opening of the word the
[1:18:57] prophets message and you see that that's
[1:19:00] bringing the bride then into view
[1:19:02] she comes back she comes into view the
[1:19:05] bride and she will be God manifest in
[1:19:11] human flesh that is the son of my
[1:19:16] brother Branham was a part of that
[1:19:18] because he was part of the body of
[1:19:20] Christ yet he was a church he's a
[1:19:23] messenger like I said in our the other
[1:19:24] day think about all the things he was a
[1:19:26] prophet he was a church agent messenger
[1:19:28] he was a prophet spoke of in the Bible
[1:19:30] to come forth now look how for Luke 17
[1:19:34] there you know and here he comes and he
[1:19:38] speaks these things but he has to go off
[1:19:40] the same like John the Baptist said I
[1:19:45] must decrease it he might increase your
[1:19:47] profit brought those same things it had
[1:19:51] to go off of the scene to where the
[1:19:54] bride would begin to realize who she is
[1:20:00] what about it the redemption of these
[1:20:04] bodies is now possible because we have
[1:20:08] had the message of redemption her body
[1:20:15] soul and spirit to be redeemed
[1:20:18] come on musicians what about it
[1:20:24] the son of man the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:30] to be the son of man but that's the
[1:20:33] brother man let's just make him a little
[1:20:35] bit too much out of the bride why it's
[1:20:40] what he said he chose his wife he said
[1:20:46] it all in motion and spoke of it
[1:20:51] spoken word regional seed what what did
[1:20:53] he coming through there oh no and he
[1:20:54] said something about that said you get
[1:20:57] that Brut nuber said it takes you back
[1:20:59] like he wasn't beginning and he's
[1:21:01] positive you hear in the thigh he paused
[1:21:02] and he said something like what
[1:21:06] that was great I've never seen that
[1:21:08] before they take a right back to where
[1:21:11] we're going now to finish it up yours
[1:21:16] all the demons striking the body trying
[1:21:22] its best to keep the bride from reaching
[1:21:28] it see doc I can stand here and say for
[1:21:33] the way that I believe it then them
[1:21:36] demons out there now are fighting the
[1:21:39] word that has been broke has been
[1:21:41] brought first he does it then he reveals
[1:21:46] it and then he makes it manifest all
[1:21:49] right so he's revealed it he's doing it
[1:21:53] and he's showing us the redemption of
[1:21:55] the body these diseases has no right to
[1:21:58] be on you and I we can we can turn it
[1:22:02] away we can cast it off we can but just
