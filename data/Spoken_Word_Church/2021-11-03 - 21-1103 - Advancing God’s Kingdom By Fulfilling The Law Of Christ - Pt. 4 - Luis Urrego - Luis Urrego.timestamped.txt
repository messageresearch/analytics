[8:38] most and foremost amen let those times
[8:40] amen be a stepping stone for you to grow
[8:43] closer to god amen praise god so let's
[8:46] uh let's go to the word this this
[8:49] evening and we want to
[8:51] turn to the book of john chapter 15.
[8:54] john chapter 15 we're going to start
[8:55] reading in verse 8. i want to
[8:58] i want to
[8:59] preach this evening on the last the last
[9:01] part of that little series that we were
[9:03] talking about advancing god's kingdom by
[9:06] fulfilling the law of christ and this is
[9:08] this is part four
[9:09] amen
[9:11] and uh
[9:12] for a subtitle i i just have it as god's
[9:15] new world order established amen
[9:18] so uh
[9:20] we hear that word a lot and we've been
[9:21] hearing it for many years you know the
[9:24] new world order the new world order you
[9:26] hear presidents talking about the new
[9:27] world order let me tell you god had a
[9:29] new world order already in mind amen
[9:32] before even they even started talking
[9:34] about it they're looking at it from a
[9:36] from a physical kingdom that's going to
[9:38] be established here and that they're
[9:40] going to live forever throughout
[9:42] eternal life
[9:44] not outside of the word that's what
[9:46] they're looking at but we have eternal
[9:48] life amen that was in him before the
[9:50] foundation of the world amen that's the
[9:52] true eternal life and that's the is
[9:54] that's the new world order that he wants
[9:56] to establish in us first that therefore
[9:59] it can be manifested physically amen has
[10:02] to be established in us first before it
[10:04] can be established here on earth
[10:06] amen so so that that is that is what
[10:09] we're looking at a man satan all can
[10:11] satan can do is just copy
[10:14] he can only mimic what god has already
[10:16] said in his word
[10:18] praise god so we just thank god for that
[10:20] so let's let's just um let's read john
[10:23] chapter 15
[10:25] verse 8.
[10:26] it says herein is my father glorified
[10:28] that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be
[10:31] my disciples
[10:33] as the father hath loved me
[10:35] so have i loved you
[10:37] continue ye in my love
[10:40] if you keep my commandments
[10:42] amen if you keep my commandments
[10:45] ye shall abide in my love even as i have
[10:49] kept my father's commandments and abide
[10:51] in his love notice that the central
[10:54] theme here is love
[10:55] these things have i spoken unto you
[10:58] that my joy might remain in you
[11:02] and that your joy might be full amen
[11:05] verse 12. this is my commandment now
[11:08] look what he brings them down this is my
[11:10] commandment
[11:11] right
[11:13] that ye love one another
[11:16] he
[11:16] he did not say this is my suggestion
[11:20] this is my commandment in order this is
[11:23] something you must do
[11:25] especially as being part of the body of
[11:27] christ that ye love one another
[11:29] as i have loved you
[11:32] right
[11:33] greater love hath no man than this
[11:36] that a man lay down his life for his
[11:39] friends in other words if you can't die
[11:42] for your brother or your friend
[11:44] you don't really love them the way you
[11:45] say
[11:46] you love them
[11:48] but he did that for us
[11:50] not just for one person he did it for
[11:52] even people that would not even serve
[11:54] him
[11:56] amen praise god you are my friends if ye
[12:01] do whatsoever i command you
[12:04] amen and that's verse 17 these things i
[12:07] command you that ye love one another he
[12:10] repeats it again and then we'll we'll
[12:11] turn to galatians chapter six verse two
[12:14] galatians chapter six verse two
[12:17] and it says bear ye one another's
[12:19] burdens
[12:20] and so fulfill
[12:22] the law of christ the law of christ that
[12:26] we just read the commandment that we
[12:28] just read bear ye one another's burdens
[12:31] that in in i like the way it says it in
[12:34] in another version it says you obey the
[12:36] law of christ when you offer each other
[12:39] a helping hand
[12:41] amen praise the lord jesus well we're
[12:43] this ain't deep tonight but we need it
[12:46] because we like it
[12:48] we like it big time amen so let's just
[12:51] let's just bow our heads our heavenly
[12:53] father we thank you lord jesus for
[12:55] another opportunity to serve you lord we
[12:57] appreciate lord god the
[12:59] the uh your word father god in its
[13:02] simplicity lord jesus if we could just
[13:04] take it father in in simplicity lord god
[13:06] it would just help us so much lord and
[13:09] lord jesus we ask that you to anoint
[13:10] father god the your word as it goes
[13:13] forth anoint the lips lord god that's
[13:15] speaking this evening i'm insufficient
[13:17] within myself lord but father god you
[13:20] are
[13:20] i can do all things through you lord i
[13:23] pray lord that you would bless the
[13:24] hearers here tonight
[13:26] meet every need that's amongst us be
[13:28] with brother richard sister and the lord
[13:30] as they're having health problems i ask
[13:32] that you would just be with them bless
[13:34] them raise them back up father god
[13:36] and lord jesus we just thank you once
[13:38] again for this opportunity to hear your
[13:40] word we ask these things now in the name
[13:42] of the lord jesus christ amen amen you
[13:45] may be seated tonight
[13:50] praise the lord
[13:52] amen just just just as in a form of of a
[13:55] review you know we we we've covered uh
[13:58] quite a few quite a few things but uh
[14:01] mainly just trying to keep it
[14:03] centralized
[14:04] around love amen now we know that god
[14:08] doesn't love a man with affiliate love
[14:10] amen a failure love is love that is that
[14:14] comes and goes and it's the love that
[14:16] you may have for your for your wife for
[14:18] the love that you may have for your
[14:19] husband the love that that i have for my
[14:22] daughter you see or
[14:23] or or anyone or you or love that you
[14:25] might have for your pet but you know
[14:27] what if something changes amen that love
[14:29] sometimes changes
[14:31] amen what's that brother or that sister
[14:33] they do something you don't like or you
[14:35] didn't like the way they spoke to you
[14:37] amen that love could change
[14:39] amen but at agape love amen that love
[14:42] should not change because that's the
[14:44] love that god loves us with and
[14:46] therefore since it's eternal amen it
[14:48] sticks
[14:49] [Laughter]
[14:51] it sticks it's eternal amen don't you
[14:54] like something that that sticks when
[14:55] you're trying to
[14:56] to glue something you know on and and
[14:59] using that gorilla glue you know or
[15:01] something like that and you know that if
[15:03] you use good some good glue you know
[15:05] it's going to stick something's going to
[15:06] stay and it should stay there forever
[15:08] pretty much right
[15:10] and then but when you're using some
[15:12] cheap glue you know and then just just
[15:13] falling apart you know that that's
[15:15] that's like a filial love
[15:18] but agape love sticks like gorilla glue
[15:21] or more
[15:23] amen so just so that's the kind of love
[15:25] that we want to love with amen praise
[15:27] god and so and so jesus here is bringing
[15:30] this commandment to us amen and he's
[15:32] trying as we were looking there in the
[15:34] in in john chapter 13 and we read
[15:37] through the whole chapter and how that
[15:39] chapter types i believe i see you know
[15:42] our day in that chapter
[15:43] every every every way you know from
[15:46] judas and and every part of it but you
[15:49] notice that after judas left the scene
[15:52] he left the table amen that's when jesus
[15:55] amen started revealing things to them
[15:57] that he would not reveal while judas was
[15:58] there so in this day saints we have to
[16:01] have our judases leave the scene amen
[16:03] and they're still leaving the scene by
[16:05] the droves amen so
[16:07] as they're leaving the scene amen god is
[16:10] revealing himself even further amen to
[16:13] his bride amen and remember he said uh
[16:16] he said he didn't say great flock he
[16:18] said little flock amen
[16:21] this isn't going to be a a a a great
[16:24] thing a mega mega church type thing amen
[16:26] this is going to narrow down to
[16:28] something very very small of a small
[16:30] minority amen
[16:32] and it's that small minority amen that
[16:34] right now amen is in the process of of
[16:36] stomping satan on the head amen that's
[16:39] overcoming in this hour because i
[16:40] believe god said that he would have
[16:42] overcomers in this hour
[16:44] and i believe that's just you and me
[16:46] amen that's you and me overcomers in
[16:49] this hour young and old amen we are
[16:51] overcoming in this hour amen
[16:53] how do you say well the old people how
[16:55] are they overcoming amen they're
[16:56] overcoming amen because one day they're
[16:58] going to get a body change
[17:01] amen and that will be the final
[17:03] overcoming amen the overcoming of death
[17:05] amen praise the lord you're looking
[17:07] forward to that brother dale right
[17:09] amen i'm looking forward to and i'm much
[17:11] younger than than him but i sir
[17:15] look amen we won't be breaking fingers
[17:18] anymore we wouldn't be we won't be uh uh
[17:20] getting sick anymore we won't be amen
[17:22] it'll just be it'll just be perfect amen
[17:26] total complete no death amen no worrying
[17:28] about anything else amen oh my i'm
[17:31] looking forward to that
[17:32] praise god amen and it's happening right
[17:34] now and god's establishing that right
[17:36] now and you and i
[17:38] amen praise the lord jesus amen so so
[17:42] god amen so jesus brings in this new
[17:45] commandment now you ask amen
[17:47] did god then god give us the
[17:49] commandments amen he gave them the
[17:51] commandments in the old testament praise
[17:53] the lord
[17:54] but guess what at the beginning of the
[17:57] commandments amen he talks about love
[18:00] love
[18:01] right
[18:01] he said love love uh love um what is the
[18:04] first commandment love god amen and love
[18:07] thy neighbor as thyself amen
[18:09] so that is what god is trying to bring
[18:12] us amen because let me tell you things
[18:14] remember when brother branham went
[18:15] behind the curtain of time
[18:17] remember that
[18:19] what what did he say he said nothing
[18:21] will get there without perfect love
[18:24] nothing that's right in other words
[18:26] nobody will get there without perfect
[18:29] love and if you don't have the one that
[18:31] represented perfect love perfectly amen
[18:35] inside of you amen truly loving your
[18:38] brother the way you should love them
[18:39] truly loving your sister the way you
[18:41] should love them amen then you're not
[18:43] going to get there
[18:44] i i'm sorry i'm bringing bad news to you
[18:47] amen but that's the truth you ain't
[18:49] going to be there paul because the the
[18:51] the love has to be in you amen
[18:54] work in itself on the outside amen do
[18:56] you realize that it's got to be love
[18:58] working from the inside out amen this is
[19:00] going to change our bodies
[19:03] what's at the top
[19:05] amen
[19:06] it's going to be it's going to be
[19:08] perfect love that's going to call the
[19:09] saints amen from the grave
[19:12] amen
[19:13] so if it's not working in us right now
[19:15] if we're just church goers if we're just
[19:17] oh you know we're just taking every
[19:19] then then we got to seek that perfect
[19:21] love
[19:22] we've got to seek and what is perfect
[19:24] love it's the holy spirit
[19:26] it's the word amen
[19:28] it's what he is amen he is love praise
[19:31] god
[19:32] amen so i want him a man to change me
[19:35] from the inside out more and more amen i
[19:38] i want to love the way he loves amen i i
[19:41] want to i want to care amen the way he
[19:43] cares i want to be able to see the way
[19:46] he sees us amen we fail him many times
[19:50] and we make many mistakes amen and yet
[19:52] he still died for each and every one of
[19:54] us amen he died not just for our sins
[19:56] but he died for even for our iniquities
[19:59] and we talked about iniquity amen and
[20:01] iniquity is is doing what you're
[20:04] supposed to
[20:05] not doing what you know that you're
[20:07] supposed to do
[20:08] amen
[20:09] or doing what what's the other way the
[20:12] other thing
[20:15] i get it confused sometimes
[20:18] doing that it's knowing that it's not
[20:19] right
[20:20] yeah that that's the other things amen
[20:23] so that is what iniquity is amen
[20:27] praise god
[20:28] so let's just let's just uh let's just
[20:31] continue amen here
[20:33] um
[20:35] uh
[20:36] let me go down here to my notes
[20:39] this is my whole the whole chapter the
[20:42] whole
[20:42] series here all in one place amen praise
[20:46] god amen
[20:47] so let's uh let's read here in
[20:54] amen in john chapter 15
[21:00] yes john chapter 15 amen
[21:06] in verse 8 which which we just read amen
[21:09] he says here herein is my father
[21:11] glorified
[21:12] that ye bear much fruit
[21:15] so shall ye be my disciples as the
[21:17] father hath loved me so have i loved you
[21:20] and he says continue ye in my love amen
[21:24] if you keep my commandments ye shall
[21:26] abide in my love
[21:28] even as i have kept my father's
[21:30] commandments amen praise god you see
[21:33] our lord jesus christ was our example
[21:35] amen
[21:37] obviously he was god amen he came here
[21:39] to live out this life before you and i
[21:42] did
[21:43] amen the head amen had to live it out
[21:45] first before the body could follow amen
[21:48] praise god so therefore he has given us
[21:50] this commandment amen to to love amen
[21:55] to love each other amen as he has loved
[21:58] us amen praise god this is verse 12 this
[22:01] is my commandment that ye love one
[22:03] another as i have loved you
[22:06] amen now
[22:08] brother branham says here in in in this
[22:11] in christ the mystery of god revealed
[22:13] and we're
[22:14] i i just want to i feel like reading
[22:17] this this quote again because i believe
[22:19] is just so important amen and sometimes
[22:21] we just overlook it but he says here and
[22:23] and it's a very familiar quote to us he
[22:25] says love one another
[22:27] above everything
[22:30] amen love of one another above
[22:31] everything it doesn't matter what
[22:33] anybody has done to you

[27:58] all right do you believe brahma was a
[28:00] prophet of god amen do you believe what
[28:02] he's saying amen
[28:04] amen i do do now do you now do you
[28:06] remember that
[28:07] congregation says amen the enemy will
[28:09] come and when he does just cling that
[28:12] much closer together
[28:15] amen
[28:16] my goodness if if churches a man would
[28:18] have taken this to consider it there
[28:20] probably would have been less splits in
[28:22] in the message amen less problems in the
[28:24] message amen if they were to just heed
[28:26] these words
[28:28] amen but you see they put their eye on
[28:30] man sometimes
[28:31] instead of the holy spirit instead of
[28:33] god
[28:34] amen
[28:36] the enemy will come and when he does
[28:37] just cling that much closer together and
[28:39] the one that the devil is using for an
[28:41] enemy will either get out or come in and
[28:44] be one of you that's all
[28:46] amen don't ever clan among one or or
[28:49] talk make yourself clannish
[28:51] amen
[28:53] in other words the little group say man
[28:55] well you can't be part of our group amen
[28:57] you you don't know you know our type of
[28:59] talk you know our our conversation the
[29:01] way we say things you know the the
[29:04] little hidden meanings amen you don't
[29:05] know anything about that amen so you
[29:07] can't be part of our group amen
[29:10] but brother brown says here don't be
[29:11] clannish
[29:12] that's what a clan is they have their
[29:14] own handshake they have their own way of
[29:17] doing things amen but he said don't be
[29:19] clanders you just love everybody amen
[29:21] everybody's included amen you you put me
[29:24] out of your circle i'll just email just
[29:25] make the circle bigger amen
[29:28] praise god
[29:29] don't ever clan among one or talk make
[29:31] yourself clannish we are one
[29:34] now what is jesus christ trying to bring
[29:36] us to amen we'll read john 17 here in
[29:38] just a moment amen but what is he trying
[29:41] to bring us to
[29:42] to a unity
[29:44] a oneness
[29:45] amen of love i couldn't say left hand
[29:48] i'm mad at you i'm going to take you

[29:54] preach you know i i'm adding that in
[29:56] he's my left hand i want him to stay
[29:58] there even the little tip of my finger i
[30:02] want i want to stay right there
[30:04] amen i certainly do i broke my finger my
[30:07] pinky finger this past weekend
[30:09] and my you don't know how important a
[30:11] pinky is when you lose weight when you
[30:13] lose it
[30:15] when you lose a body part that's how you
[30:17] realize i needed that body part for real
[30:22] amen we'll just we'll we'll we'll add
[30:24] something there about that here in just
[30:26] a moment amen
[30:28] amen don't ever uh where we're at even
[30:30] the little tip of my finger i want to
[30:32] stay right there every little part of my
[30:33] body stay right there and god wants us
[30:35] as a body of believers to stay right
[30:38] exactly with one another right at with
[30:40] one another
[30:42] now as we're reading this hey man ask
[30:43] yourself is this what i'm doing
[30:46] is this the attitude that i have
[30:49] am i willing to give up my life for my
[30:51] brother or my sister
[30:53] whether whatever they said to me
[30:56] or whatever they did or did not do to me
[30:58] that i did or didn't like
[31:00] are you willing to give up your life for
[31:02] him or her
[31:04] ask yourself those questions because
[31:06] that's what isn't that what jesus just
[31:07] commanded us to do
[31:09] did we just read that
[31:11] amen
[31:13] amen
[31:15] and now you've got tapes on that you've
[31:17] got tapes on what we believe you've got
[31:18] tapes on discipline in the church how we
[31:20] behave ourselves in the church of god
[31:22] how we got to come here together and sit
[31:24] together in heavenly places don't stay
[31:27] home
[31:28] if god is in your heart you can't hardly
[31:30] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[31:33] to get in here to fellowship with your
[31:35] brothers
[31:36] amen some people start cringing when we
[31:38] start getting to this part of the quote
[31:42] i'm sorry but it's the truth
[31:44] brother brown said it don't stay home
[31:46] especially in this day that we're living
[31:48] in
[31:49] if you don't if you don't feel that way
[31:51] then i tell you it's time you got to
[31:53] praying
[31:55] because we're in the last days
[31:57] he said that in 1963 amen how much more
[31:59] in 2021
[32:03] where the bible exhorted us to much more
[32:06] as we see that they approaching
[32:08] to love one another with christian love
[32:10] and divine love
[32:12] to assemble ourselves together in
[32:14] heavenly places and christ jesus love
[32:17] and love one another this will all man
[32:19] know you are my disciples and we just
[32:21] read this right
[32:22] when you got love one for the other
[32:24] that's right stay right together
[32:27] if the brother you think he's a little
[32:29] wrong or the sister say lord don't let
[32:31] me never have the root of bitterness
[32:33] springing up
[32:36] how important is that
[32:38] because i'll it'll affect him and it'll
[32:40] take the christ right out of your life
[32:42] you think you think that when you have
[32:44] bitterness against somebody that's
[32:46] that's towards that person
[32:48] and you're not realizing that that's
[32:50] eating you also from the inside out you
[32:53] think oh it's just towards that person
[32:55] you know he's the one that needs to be
[32:56] right he she's the one that needs to get
[32:58] right she's the one that's wrong amen
[32:59] but in doing that you're being eaten up
[33:02] spiritually
[33:04] from the inside out
[33:08] amen
[33:10] lord don't ever let me have the root of
[33:12] bitterness spring up because it'll
[33:13] affect him and it'll take the christ
[33:15] right out of my life
[33:17] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[33:19] and hatred that will just take the holy
[33:21] spirit right away from you it will run
[33:23] him from the tabernacle it'll kill the
[33:25] spirit of god or drive it away from here
[33:27] it'll hurt your pastor it'll do
[33:29] everything see don't you do that you
[33:32] just wax that much closer together
[33:34] draw up take the buckle as the brother
[33:36] testified a minister here the other
[33:38] night about having a buckle seeing it in
[33:41] vision just that buckles on the whole
[33:43] armor of god just pull her on tighten up
[33:46] move right up close to one another love
[33:48] one another anyhow
[33:51] talk nice about one another
[33:53] say nice things about one another
[33:55] and then god will bless you amen
[33:59] praise god i'll be the first one to say
[34:01] lord i i i want that amen
[34:04] sometimes how easy it is amen for us to
[34:07] just slip up and say demeaning things
[34:09] amen towards one another or about was
[34:12] one another amen and out of a joke
[34:15] and then you know in your heart you feel
[34:16] condemned
[34:18] but because you think it makes somebody
[34:20] laugh amen you just go right out and say
[34:22] well let me tell you amen that takes the
[34:23] spirit of christ out of the whole thing
[34:25] amen amen
[34:28] it's how serious it is
[34:30] it's serious amen praise god so
[34:33] brother branham that was brother
[34:34] branham's warning amen for us here in
[34:37] the end time amen
[34:38] praise the lord
[34:40] now let's let's why don't we read john
[34:42] chapter 17 amen and this is this is the
[34:45] uh
[34:45] this is what i wanted to get to and
[34:47] we'll read it quickly but i
[34:49] i encourage you a man to read this
[34:52] chapter
[34:53] on your own and just really look at it
[34:55] because let me tell you
[34:57] if you want to know where
[34:59] i mean how many knows that jesus prayed
[35:01] for you
[35:03] this is the chapter where jesus prayed
[35:05] for you
[35:06] and he prayed for you
[35:08] he interceded for you and you were not
[35:11] even born
[35:13] you were not even on the scene and he
[35:14] was already interceding for you as a
[35:17] matter of fact it gets even better he
[35:19] was he he was the lamb slain before the
[35:21] foundation of the world
[35:23] amen
[35:24] and here he is a man he's about to pray
[35:27] not just for his disciples but he's also
[35:29] going to pray for you amen
[35:31] and so let's just see what he says
[35:33] because remember what a high priest does
[35:35] amen a high priest what he did was
[35:37] intercede
[35:39] he was the one who was to go back into
[35:41] the into into the the holiest holies
[35:44] amen to give that blood to sprinkle that
[35:47] blood on the mercy seat
[35:49] where
[35:50] he was the one who was supposed to do it
[35:52] nobody else was supposed to do it amen
[35:55] and i'm sure the people the israelites
[35:57] out there amen they were thankful that
[35:58] they weren't the ones who had to do it
[36:00] amen they provided the sacrifice amen
[36:03] but the blood of that sacrifice amen had
[36:05] to be amen be put in the back in the in
[36:08] the holiest of holies by the whole by
[36:10] the priest amen why
[36:12] because if they didn't do it the right
[36:14] way
[36:15] if they didn't go exactly the way god
[36:18] told them to do it the high priest would
[36:19] do it they would die
[36:22] they would die
[36:24] and so jesus amen he is our high priest
[36:26] amen
[36:27] and he is here interceding for us amen
[36:30] and not just not just then amen he
[36:33] continues to intercede amen praise god
[36:36] he continues to intercede so jesus
[36:38] prayed for us amen interceded for us
[36:41] uh
[36:42] even before you were here on earth
[36:44] physically you were in his mind
[36:47] but he prayed for you amen so let's just
[36:50] let's just read here amen in john
[36:51] chapter 17
[36:54] he says here these words spake jesus and
[36:57] lifted up his eyes to heaven amen and
[37:00] you
[37:01] just do your best to stay awake amen
[37:03] amen praise god just concentrate on the
[37:05] word amen amen wake yourselves up
[37:08] amen concentrate on what he said look
[37:10] he's just he prayed for you amen
[37:12] that's wonderful amen amen i always love
[37:15] this scripture amen it gives me
[37:17] encouragement
[37:18] amen that jesus the creator of heaven
[37:20] and earth amen the one who created me
[37:22] prayed for me
[37:24] amen praise god this is his prayer amen
[37:28] amen let's try to stay awake amen
[37:30] these words spake jesus and lifted up
[37:32] his eyes to heaven and said father the
[37:35] hours come glorify thy son that thy son
[37:39] also may glorify thee amen as we're
[37:41] reading we'll we'll comment a little bit

[44:58] that's why the people couldn't
[45:00] understand his speech
[45:02] i
[45:02] sanctify them through thy truth and
[45:05] remember pilate asked what is truth
[45:08] but that's what truth is amen thy word
[45:11] is truth
[45:12] amen
[45:14] paula asked one time before jesus when
[45:16] jesus stood before him what is truth
[45:19] and the truth was standing right there
[45:20] in front of him
[45:22] amen thy word is truth because why he is
[45:25] the word amen
[45:27] as thou has sent me into the world even
[45:30] so have i also sent them into the world
[45:33] and for their sakes watch and for their
[45:35] sakes i sanctify myself that they also
[45:39] might be sanctified through the truth
[45:41] aren't you thankful that jesus christ
[45:42] did that
[45:44] he sanctified himself in other words he
[45:47] held
[45:48] he
[45:49] he held himself amen he could have had a
[45:52] wife he could have had children amen he
[45:54] was a man he was a man just like
[45:56] every other man that was living at that
[45:58] time
[45:59] but he held himself from even doing
[46:01] those things
[46:03] in order amen that that the the
[46:05] disciples could be sanctified amen
[46:08] through the truth amen
[46:10] now watch this
[46:12] verse 20. neither pray i for these alone
[46:15] not just for the disciples but for them
[46:17] also which shall believe on me through
[46:20] their word
[46:21] amen praise god amen in other words i
[46:24] don't pray just for the disciples i'm
[46:26] praying for the ones that will believe
[46:28] the word that the disciples preached to
[46:30] them amen and what happened with the
[46:32] word throughout the ages amen from the
[46:34] disciples it came to other people from
[46:36] those people and on down amen and we got
[46:38] seven church ages and finally has come
[46:41] down to us that same word
[46:43] that same prayer amen is being fulfilled
[46:45] even right now in our lives in 2021 and
[46:48] he was praised over 2000 years ago
[46:51] amen that's the reason saints amen when
[46:53] you pray
[46:55] amen when you pray that you think oh god
[46:58] is not hearing my prayer amen but let me
[47:00] tell you god is hearing your prayer amen
[47:02] it's just he knows exactly when to come
[47:05] in and answer it he sometimes there's
[47:08] there's battles do you remember when
[47:09] even when when when uh
[47:11] uh uh gabriel amen was uh daniel was
[47:14] praying and even gabriel i believe was
[47:15] gabriel was being fought amen by the
[47:17] prince of persia amen there was there
[47:19] was a hindrance there amen 21 days
[47:23] gabriel

[47:25] answer daniel's prayers
[47:28] but daniel stayed true amen daniel
[47:30] stayed firm amen daniel stayed steadfast
[47:33] praying amen praise god and finally the
[47:35] prayer was answered amen
[47:38] sometimes we may we may think oh
[47:41] god didn't answer our prayer because it
[47:43] wasn't the way we wanted it to be
[47:45] but it's god answers our prayers no
[47:48] matter how much you think he's not
[47:49] listening
[47:50] he is he's ready to hear

[52:45] and i in them
[52:48] he finishes his prayer right there with
[52:50] what
[52:52] love
[52:54] so what is the new commandment
[52:57] amen that's what he's calling us for in
[52:59] this hour saints
[53:01] amen praise the lord
[53:03] so whenever you need some peace whenever
[53:05] you need some reassurance go back and
[53:07] read john chapter 17.
[53:09] amen
[53:11] that's where he prayed for us john
[53:12] chapter 13 tells us little children yet
[53:15] a little while i am with you you shall
[53:17] seek me and as i said unto the jews
[53:19] whether i go you cannot come so now i
[53:22] say to you
[53:23] a new commandment i give unto you that
[53:26] ye love one another as i have loved you
[53:28] that you also love one another
[53:30] by this shall all men know that ye are
[53:33] my disciples if you have loved one to
[53:36] another amen praise god
[53:38] amen so
[53:41] you know brother branham said amen when
[53:43] he saw beyond the curtain of time
[53:44] nothing was going to go in there without
[53:46] perfect love praise god and you have to
[53:49] ask yourself amen am i loving the way
[53:52] he loves us
[53:55] am i am i am am i loving where am i
[53:58] faltering amen
[53:59] praise god
[54:01] where am i faltering at mormon praise
[54:03] the lord
[54:05] now in ephesians chapter four
[54:07] amen it tells us this
[54:09] we'll be we'll finish up here in just a
[54:10] moment
[54:11] ephesians chapter if i didn't give the
[54:13] brothers this but he says here paul says
[54:15] here but speaking the truth in love
[54:19] may grow up into him in all things
[54:22] which is the head even christ amen
[54:26] i was almost thinking you know it's the
[54:28] other day uh how and it might be a
[54:31] carnal thought but
[54:32] i mean you know christ is our is the
[54:34] head right
[54:35] and he can't he he had that picture
[54:38] taken there in in arizona and and and
[54:41] and that represented hoffman's head of
[54:44] christ amen
[54:45] and and we are his body
[54:47] amen and as we're awaiting saints amen
[54:50] as we are here laboring amen as we are
[54:52] here he's working through us amen
[54:54] laboring as the body amen the mind
[54:57] thinks the head thinks he is the central
[55:00] he's he's the central theme right
[55:02] without a brain you can't function
[55:06] you can't function without a brain
[55:08] amen he is our he is our he is our our
[55:11] brain amen praise god he is the brain of
[55:14] this body amen
[55:16] but it's in a glorious sense that one
[55:18] day amen this body will connect amen
[55:21] with that head amen
[55:23] because the bible says amen that we
[55:25] shall be changed in a moment in a
[55:26] twinkling of an eye amen and we shall be
[55:29] uh
[55:30] taken up amen to meet him in the air to
[55:33] connect with that head in the air praise
[55:36] god it almost reminds me of kind of like
[55:38] when in the 80s i mean when i used to
[55:40] watch those transformer cartoons and
[55:43] things like that amen and you'd see you
[55:45] know those robots say man just connect
[55:46] them with one another amen
[55:50] you know just kind of things like that
[55:51] amen but it's going to be much good more
[55:53] glorious than that amen amen praise god
[55:56] and he's doing the transformation now
[55:59] the transformation has to be taking
[56:01] place from the from inside out to amen
[56:03] praise god
[56:04] aren't you glad he's transforming us
[56:06] from glory to glory
[56:08] amen just just through his word amen but
[56:12] speaking the truth and love may grow up
[56:14] into him and all things which is the
[56:16] head even christ watch this from whom
[56:19] the whole body
[56:21] fitly joined together and compacted by
[56:24] that which every joint supplyeth
[56:27] according to the effectual working in
[56:29] the measure of every part
[56:32] maketh increase of the body unto the
[56:35] edifying of itself in what
[56:38] in love
[56:40] amen and it's and it's not a filial love
[56:42] it's agape love amen praise god amen
[56:46] amen so so
[56:48] like i was saying earlier we need our
[56:50] body parts
[56:52] amen
[56:53] i just said you know i lost uh playing
[56:56] basketball over the camp this weekend
[56:58] and i went to defend a little
[57:00] young man that i was playing with he was
[57:02] in my cabin went to try to swipe the
[57:05] ball away from him and i hit his arm and
[57:06] as i was hitting his arm my pinky bent
[57:09] up bent this way i didn't hear any
[57:11] cracking or anything like that i just
[57:13] thought that maybe it was just a spring
[57:15] but a spring but waited a few days and
[57:18] last night i got the uh the x-rays and
[57:20] sure enough it's broken right here
[57:22] on the side so you just remember me in
[57:24] prayer on that but
[57:28] but then you don't realize how important
[57:29] a pinky is until you lose it
[57:32] until you can't use it
[57:33] you see saints we don't realize how
[57:35] important each of one of us are in the
[57:38] body amen until one of us is gone

[58:00] you you you you don't realize how
[58:03] important they were to the body or or
[58:05] how special they were until they're gone

[58:09] other in that way

[58:14] much better
[58:16] that we're
[58:17] at any moment amen or tomorrow amen one
[58:20] of us that might be in here right now

[58:49] you're going to answer for it for your
[58:51] own actions and for your attitudes
[58:52] towards people amen at church
[58:55] we're not talking about we're dealing
[58:57] with with a hypocrite out there we're
[58:59] talking about you're dealing with the
[59:00] body of christ

[1:12:33] also remember this a saints that uh i've
[1:12:36] been working with brother barry coffey
[1:12:37] he is the pastor of hickory bible
[1:12:39] tabernacle in north carolina um and he's
[1:12:42] been helping he's gonna help me bring uh
[1:12:46] several a shipment of bibles there
[1:12:49] to honduras
[1:12:51] and also to nicaragua and other other
[1:12:54] places
[1:12:55] because he has a
[1:12:57] ministry called vision books
[1:12:59] and so he has connections to all these
[1:13:01] bible societies and all these different
[1:13:03] places so i've been working with him
[1:13:05] we're going to be trying to get uh like
[1:13:07] a whole palette of bible sold to
[1:13:09] honduras
[1:13:11] there's gonna they're gonna be shipping
[1:13:13] directly from honduras from a bible
[1:13:15] society there
[1:13:16] and so um
[1:13:18] um i haven't i don't know yet what the
[1:13:20] cost will be if there will even be a
[1:13:22] cost because he's donated already some
[1:13:24] bibles to me for me to take down there
[1:13:27] about 20 bibles they're on their way
[1:13:29] right now and uh
[1:13:31] that um that he that he him and his
[1:13:33] church donated to us so so i just
[1:13:35] appreciate that you remember that in
[1:13:37] prayer uh because
[1:13:39] uh in honduras in those countries
[1:13:41] they're actually more in need of bibles
[1:13:43] than they are of message books
[1:13:45] bibles are very very needed especially
[1:13:48] in the remote areas and so just remember
[1:13:51] that in your in your prayers as
[1:13:54] as if you feel led you know that you
[1:13:56] want to if you want to give something
[1:13:58] you know
[1:13:59] make it towards that and we'll get
[1:14:01] bibles
[1:14:03] there um the connections are there
[1:14:05] we just need the the funds so
[1:14:08] but you remember that in your prayers
[1:14:10] and i just appreciate brother barry's
[1:14:12] heart you know for for missions and for
[1:14:14] doing that
[1:14:15] that work you know that he's doing with
[1:14:17] the books just sending bibles and books
[1:14:19] all over the world you you know we think
[1:14:21] you know that that that we have tablets
[1:14:24] and everything like that and we don't
[1:14:25] need bible you know a physical bible but
[1:14:27] let me tell you people can't afford
[1:14:28] these things
[1:14:30] they can't afford a phone sometimes to
[1:14:32] read a bible they still look to physical
[1:14:34] books
[1:14:36] they need a physical bible and bibles in
[1:14:38] the cities are are much easier to get
[1:14:40] but those remote brothers in remote
[1:14:42] areas it's harder for them to even buy a
[1:14:44] bible
[1:14:45] we don't think of that so you remember
[1:14:47] that in prayer saints as we as we head
[1:14:49] down there november 30th amen
[1:14:53] again if nothing changes amen

[1:15:24] it would help amen if you come maybe
[1:15:26] maybe they might help you to come pray

[1:15:29] service
