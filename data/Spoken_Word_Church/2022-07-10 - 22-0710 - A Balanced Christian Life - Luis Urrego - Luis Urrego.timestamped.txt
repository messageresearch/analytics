[0:00] it has to be a balance in everything
[0:02] we see that god is a god of balance
[0:04] we see it in nature
[0:06] amen the the sun can't be too close to
[0:09] us or it'll just
[0:11] melt us away
[0:13] right it's got to be a certain distance
[0:16] there's a balance there right we see
[0:18] that the moon amen has a certain
[0:20] distance and it and it does its job and
[0:23] it does what it's supposed to do
[0:25] um
[0:26] because god put balance in there amen
[0:29] and um
[0:31] so
[0:32] we we we see that that balance is is
[0:35] very important in a christian's life
[0:37] because i one of the things that i
[0:39] noticed that when especially
[0:42] new christians or or or or people that
[0:44] are just starting to serve the lord
[0:46] you know um if you've come from a
[0:48] certain mindset or if you have a certain
[0:50] mindset
[0:51] um you're gonna lean through that
[0:53] mindset
[0:54] constantly
[0:55] and and and so depending on your
[0:59] situation and depending on the things
[1:00] that you see or that you're going
[1:02] through
[1:03] uh
[1:03] it might make you it might make you
[1:05] rocky it might make you unstable you see
[1:08] so you have to you have to
[1:10] see things in a balanced way you have to
[1:12] look at things in a balanced way
[1:15] in order for you to keep going amen
[1:18] because uh
[1:20] many times and we've seen it you know
[1:22] unbalanced christianity
[1:24] usually leads to problems
[1:27] usually leads to issues leads to issues
[1:30] with other people
[1:32] uh i'm right and you're wrong
[1:34] and that's it finally but see sometimes
[1:36] we don't stop and look and and think all
[1:39] right what is this brother talking about
[1:40] what is this sister talking about
[1:43] because we sometimes we're so used to
[1:45] just immediately flying off the handle
[1:46] if they say something that's not it's
[1:48] contrary to what to what the way i see
[1:51] things
[1:52] and to me that's not balanced
[1:53] christianity
[1:55] to me is you just you're just you're
[1:57] just
[1:58] reacting to to how things are and and
[2:01] that's not how we're supposed to act
[2:04] i mean jesus didn't act like that
[2:06] he had balance in the way he dealt with
[2:08] things when they came to him
[2:10] and we'll look at two examples of that
[2:13] here in just a moment but
[2:16] now god talks about in in in the bible
[2:19] uh in proverbs chapter 11 verse 1 a
[2:22] false balance is abomination to the lord
[2:25] but a just wait is his delight
[2:28] now we know he he we we
[2:31] there was in in the old testament there
[2:33] was a god hated false balances
[2:36] in other words when when you would go to
[2:38] the market and you'd give them
[2:41] you'd say i want certain amount of of
[2:43] this item and and they kind of don't put
[2:46] that certain amount in there but yet
[2:47] charge you the same price god hated that
[2:50] because that was a cheat that was that
[2:51] was cheating that was you lying that was
[2:54] you
[2:54] uh um uh treating your brother or or or
[2:58] uh in a false way you see or your sister
[3:01] in a false way
[3:03] so taking it into spiritual
[3:06] amen
[3:07] a false balance
[3:09] is abomination to the lord
[3:12] but a just wait
[3:15] is his
[3:16] delight all right so
[3:20] we see that god loves balance right
[3:23] amen god not just loves it he delights
[3:26] in it
[3:27] right
[3:28] praise the lord
[3:29] we can also see in
[3:31] you know
[3:36] in uh
[3:37] proverbs chapter 16 verse 11
[3:39] adjust weight and balance are the lord's
[3:43] all the weights of the bag are his work
[3:46] all right
[3:48] now you taking it looking at it from the
[3:50] physical but also think and think of it
[3:52] in the spiritual as well
[3:55] and then job 31 6 tells us let me be
[3:58] weighed in an even balance
[4:01] that god may know mine integrity
[4:04] amen even job desire to have balance
[4:08] and so the only way we can have balance
[4:10] saints in this in this life is the holy
[4:12] ghost yes the holy ghost is the one that
[4:15] gives us balance
[4:16] amen we come to this world and we pass
[4:19] through this world we become christians
[4:21] and we bring all the weight that we had
[4:23] a uh from from from the world
[4:27] bring it into into christianity and
[4:29] there we're trying to balance things out
[4:32] and sometimes
[4:33] we let the things of the world or those
[4:36] old views amen take the take the most of
[4:39] us
[4:40] one of the examples that you that you
[4:41] can give is for example if you
[4:43] grew up in the pentecostal church or if
[4:46] you grew up in in a church where there
[4:48] was more emotion and there was more uh
[4:52] you know jumping shouting screaming and
[4:55] all of that you coming to the message
[4:57] that's what you're going to do
[4:59] you see the message you saw that god
[5:01] sent a prophet
[5:02] just like the brother who came from the
[5:04] baptist church
[5:05] you both saw the same thing but in the
[5:07] emotion realm you receive the word in a
[5:10] separate in a different way one is more
[5:12] emotional than the other doesn't make
[5:14] one better than the other that's right
[5:18] therefore we shouldn't be judging one
[5:20] another
[5:22] amen
[5:23] we should be patient with one another
[5:26] well this brother doesn't jump and shout
[5:27] like i do
[5:29] he didn't grow up that way
[5:31] but it doesn't mean that he's not
[5:33] receiving the word like you are right
[5:36] you don't know
[5:37] i don't either
[5:38] well this brother jumps and shouts too
[5:40] much and screams and and and he just he
[5:43] he speaks too fast
[5:47] does he serve the same god that you do
[5:50] does he love the lord does he want to go
[5:51] to the same heaven that you do
[5:54] we all have the same goal we all have
[5:56] the same amen so amen try to keep a
[6:00] balance
[6:02] don't be critical
[6:03] keep balance balance christianity job
[6:06] even wanted balance let me be weighed in
[6:08] an even balance that god may know
[6:11] my integrity
[6:13] praise the lord
[6:18] amen
[6:20] all right as we as we mentioned here in
[6:22] just a moment
[6:23] uh just a moment ago
[6:27] we see that there's balance in nature
[6:30] everything has to work in balance
[6:32] it can't be too much of something it can
[6:35] be too little of something
[6:37] right that sun has to be a certain
[6:39] distance in order for things to grow
[6:43] right in order to make things
[6:45] uh do what they're supposed to do
[6:48] and there's just so much that we see
[6:50] that goes on on the earth and if god
[6:53] didn't put things in the exact
[6:55] place and and in the right proportions
[6:58] where it needed to be amen then things
[7:00] would be out of cater you see
[7:02] and it's the same thing in christianity
[7:05] things have to be in the right
[7:06] proportions you can't have too much of
[7:08] it or you can't have too little of it
[7:10] it's got to be in the right proportion
[7:12] in order for me to make this thing run
[7:15] right
[7:16] praise the lord
[7:18] amen we so we see balance in nature we
[7:20] see balance in our bodies
[7:22] man your bodies have to be they have to
[7:25] be a certain balance they have to have a
[7:26] certain temperature
[7:28] right i believe it's
[7:30] 98.66 degrees something like that
[7:33] right it's just a ruse
[7:36] if if you get out of that temperature
[7:38] just a a degree
[7:40] right a a degree less or a degree more
[7:43] amen there's going to be health problems
[7:45] in your in your body
[7:47] just one degree
[7:48] it gets out of balance
[7:50] right when you get off one word
[7:54] a man or when you come in with a
[7:56] critical spirit
[7:58] one criticism
[8:00] coming to the church it takes the whole
[8:02] thing off cater
[8:04] it takes the whole thing off balance
[8:07] it takes your life off balance
[8:09] right and it makes everybody else amen
[8:13] get off balance
[8:15] because you know
[8:16] who wants to be around a critical spirit
[8:20] i don't
[8:24] first corinthians 10 13 tells us there
[8:26] hath no temptation i mean even there's
[8:29] balance in our trials that's what i just
[8:31] want to try to say look look what look
[8:32] what jesus said or what peter uh paul
[8:35] said there hath no temptation taking you
[8:37] but such as is common to man but god is
[8:40] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[8:43] tempted above
[8:44] that you are able
[8:47] but will with the temptation also make a
[8:50] way to escape that ye may be able to
[8:52] bear it
[8:54] even in your own trials and in your old
[8:56] temptations and in your own surprise
[8:58] problems that god allows there's a
[9:00] balance to it
[9:03] god has a balance he won't give you more
[9:05] than what you can handle and he won't
[9:07] give you less than you can handle right
[9:09] it gives you just exactly what he knows
[9:11] that you can handle
[9:13] oh lord i can't do it i can't you're
[9:15] going through it that means god is
[9:17] allowed that
[9:18] specially catered that trial just for
[9:20] you
[9:22] because you're going through it that's
[9:24] how much god loves you and he cares
[9:27] about balancing your life amen
[9:30] praise the lord so there's balance even
[9:32] in our trials there's balance right
[9:34] praise the lord
[9:36] so
[9:38] what is balance
[9:39] what is balance and and
[9:41] and these are the definitions of the
[9:43] word balance and even
[9:45] distribution of weight
[9:47] enabling someone or something to remain
[9:50] upright and steady
[9:53] all right so there's there is is an even
[9:55] distribution of weight
[9:57] so that something can stay upright
[10:00] right
[10:01] you know this bottle right here there's
[10:03] an even distribution of weight
[10:06] uh uh
[10:07] you know so they can stand upright right
[10:10] it was it was made in a way where the
[10:12] weight where it can the weight can be
[10:14] held
[10:15] evenly so if let's say if sometimes we
[10:18] get these bottles and they're shrunken
[10:19] up too much you know maybe the sun's
[10:21] shrunken up and you stand them up and
[10:23] they're like this
[10:25] that
[10:26] it lost balance
[10:28] there's balance that's been lost it's
[10:30] been affected by the elements
[10:33] and the trials or the problems that it
[10:35] has or maybe the way it grew up
[10:38] the way he grew up and he thinks he's
[10:40] right or she's right she's off balance
[10:43] like the tower of pisa in italy that
[10:45] we're about to look at here in just a
[10:47] moment
[10:48] and you walk you walk your life you
[10:50] think you're the one that's right
[10:54] and you're the one that's off balance
[10:56] and you don't even know it see somebody
[10:58] who somebody who thinks that they're who
[11:00] doesn't think that they're wrong
[11:02] uh you know a liar doesn't think he's a
[11:04] liar
[11:07] a cheater doesn't think he's a cheater
[11:10] a a person who constantly uh uh uh
[11:14] you know backbiting or or talking about
[11:16] people doesn't think that he's a
[11:18] gossiper or she's a gossiper
[11:20] they don't
[11:22] but you see it takes the word of god to
[11:24] show you those things
[11:26] and if the word of god shows you amen
[11:28] where you're at then it'll help you put
[11:30] your life back in balance
[11:33] right
[11:34] now you're the one who has to accept it
[11:38] take that word and say lord i'm off
[11:39] cater a little bit
[11:41] let me get back in balance
[11:43] that goes from the pulpit all the way to
[11:45] the janitor's room
[11:47] we all need to get back in balance
[11:51] it's also a condition in which different
[11:53] elements are equal or in the correct
[11:55] proportions amen
[11:58] also keep or put something in a steady
[12:01] position so that it does not fall
[12:04] okay
[12:05] yeah so if i put this right there look
[12:08] it's about to fall
[12:10] all right
[12:11] put it back here too much right here
[12:13] it's about to fall
[12:15] and if i put it right here in the middle
[12:17] it stays
[12:19] right it stays in balance
[12:22] and then brother branham always talked
[12:23] about the middle of the road
[12:25] staying in the middle of the road
[12:27] why did he say that
[12:29] because that keeps you in balance that
[12:32] keeps you steady when you're riding on
[12:33] the in on the road and let's say it's
[12:36] wet or or it's been raining usually it's
[12:38] the sides that's usually very wet and a
[12:42] lot of you know it makes you unstable
[12:45] but when you stay in the middle of the
[12:46] road that water is running towards the
[12:48] east side like this
[12:50] and when you stay in the middle of the
[12:51] road it keeps you better stable
[12:54] you see so it keeps you in more balance
[12:57] and better balance
[13:00] why is it important to have balance in
[13:02] our christian walk
[13:04] i want to ask you that why do you think
[13:06] it's important
[13:08] to to to have balance
[13:10] sister
[13:19] you will um ever imagine in your life
[13:21] how desperate you are to make everything
[13:24] right and
[13:25] have that balance until
[13:27] something like this
[13:30] until something rocks it yeah
[13:40] amen
[13:41] that's a very and it's a very good
[13:43] reason too
[13:45] because usually it's not until we
[13:47] experience something that we don't
[13:48] understand
[13:50] where we really are
[13:51] you see
[13:52] and so
[13:55] very important so so balance
[13:59] balance keeps you focused now let's
[14:02] let's let's look at a man on a tight bro
[14:04] brother wade has been talking about the
[14:06] that man i forget his name
[14:09] what was his name
[14:11] melinda wallander wallenda
[14:13] well linda
[14:15] he was a type
[14:16] walker and we have many tightrope
[14:18] walkers all around the world who
[14:20] practice this
[14:21] now in looking at a tightrope walker
[14:24] they have to stay
[14:26] balanced the whole way
[14:28] in order to get to the other side right
[14:32] so you have to stay focused so balance
[14:35] keeps you keeps you focused
[14:37] right
[14:38] it also keeps you thinking first instead
[14:41] of reacting
[14:43] all right think first instead of
[14:44] reacting brother so-and-so said
[14:46] something to me oh i'm gonna just say
[14:48] something back to no
[14:50] that might not be the way to handle the
[14:51] situation
[14:53] all right
[14:54] stay balanced what does the word say
[14:59] helps you to think about the next step
[15:01] is he a tight roll walker he has to
[15:03] think about the next step
[15:05] he takes it one step at a time and what
[15:07] is our christianity is one day at a
[15:10] time one step at a time
[15:13] amen one service at a time
[15:16] take it one step at a time
[15:18] and also balance keeps you moving
[15:20] forward
[15:22] right it keeps you looking ahead it
[15:24] keeps you looking looking looking at the
[15:26] mark it keeps you moving forward
[15:29] praise the lord
[15:31] so
[15:32] that's how typewrite walker gets across
[15:35] he's not looking all around the
[15:37] situations and the problems and that and
[15:39] that man pointing at him and and and and
[15:42] and clapping and things like that no
[15:44] he's looking
[15:45] ahead
[15:46] he's staying focused he's staying
[15:49] thinking about his next step
[15:52] not what everybody else is saying around
[15:53] him not what everybody else thinks about
[15:55] him amen he keeps looking ahead
[15:59] keeps thinking forward amen
[16:01] praise the lord james 1 8 tells us a
[16:03] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[16:06] ways amen one that flies off the handle
[16:10] and reacts amen when you tell him
[16:12] something you come up and then he just
[16:13] says something right back to you some
[16:15] snappy and something smart
[16:17] that's on stability
[16:19] that's instability
[16:21] praise the lord
[16:25] and many of us need to practice
[16:27] on that
[16:28] we we're so we're so quick to just fly
[16:32] off the just say whatever comes to our
[16:34] head
[16:35] amen
[16:36] but it doesn't help us
[16:38] and it makes sometimes it just makes
[16:40] things worse
[16:41] now what is balancing balance uh in
[16:44] balancing tires brother donnie you might
[16:46] know this
[16:47] right balancing uh
[16:49] when when you feel when you feel like
[16:51] the uh
[16:52] that you're there's too much vibration
[16:55] in in in when you're riding and then
[16:57] maybe you might need a tire balance your
[17:00] car may need a tire balance and there's
[17:02] a whole process they use weights and
[17:03] things in order to balance tires
[17:06] well even a vehicle needs to have the
[17:08] tires in order for the thing to run and
[17:11] in order for the thing to get to where
[17:12] it needs to go it needs to have a
[17:14] balance as well
[17:15] the tires need to have balance so if
[17:18] balance your spiritual tires when you
[17:20] perceive that there's too much vibration
[17:22] how do you do that
[17:24] balance it with the weights of the word
[17:26] amen
[17:28] looking in the word
[17:30] that's how you get balanced
[17:34] now i want to look at the statue of a
[17:35] perfect man here for just a moment
[17:38] but uh
[17:39] because even even in in in in food in in
[17:43] the in the things that we eat there has
[17:45] to be a balance as well right
[17:47] and the government gave us a supposed
[17:50] uh food pyramid
[17:53] we know that that doesn't that doesn't
[17:54] work many of us now don't don't work but
[17:57] just to give you an example
[18:01] this is what people's food pyramid is
[18:04] close enough
[18:05] [Laughter]
[18:09] hey i mean
[18:11] in a pizza slice i'm eating meat i'm
[18:13] eating bread i'm eating uh dairy
[18:16] and uh you know whatever else is in the
[18:18] pizza
[18:19] that's close enough
[18:24] but really in reality that that eating
[18:27] so many so much bread and grains and all
[18:29] that stuff that's why people are the way
[18:30] they are they look the way they are they
[18:32] eat too many too much bread so really
[18:35] that thing doesn't work
[18:38] but
[18:40] in looking and looking at that looking
[18:42] at the statue of a perfect man even
[18:44] adding to your faith
[18:47] right
[18:48] that's
[18:49] all these virtues that are working in
[18:50] our lives they're working in balance
[18:52] right
[18:54] right you have to you have to you
[18:56] god wants
[18:58] god wants us to have these virtues in
[19:00] our life in balance now there come there
[19:02] will come needs and situations in our
[19:05] life where we may have to work a bit
[19:06] more godliness than
[19:09] them patience at that moment or a little
[19:11] bit more temperance than and then than
[19:14] to use knowledge at that moment but all
[19:16] these virtues they're working in us amen
[19:19] in a balanced way you see why because
[19:22] they are holy ghost virtues and the holy
[19:25] ghost is not an unbalanced person
[19:27] he's a he's a he's a person of balance
[19:30] right and it all starts with faith
[19:33] and uh
[19:35] and and so in ii peter i can read the
[19:38] whole thing here but it says in besides
[19:40] this given all diligence add to your
[19:42] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and
[19:44] to knowledge temperance and to
[19:46] temperance patience and to patience
[19:48] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[19:50] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[19:51] charity for these things be in you and
[19:54] the bound right
[19:56] god wants these things to abound in us
[19:59] they make you that ye shall neither be
[20:01] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[20:02] of our lord jesus christ but he that
[20:05] lacketh these things you see that here's
[20:07] one in verse 8 that
[20:10] that peter is saying these things need
[20:12] to be abound but when they're lacking
[20:14] there's no balance right
[20:16] they need to they need there needs to be
[20:18] a balance but he that lack of these
[20:20] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[20:24] right
[20:25] like that type walker he can't
[20:27] concentrate he can't he don't know what
[20:29] his next step is
[20:31] right when these virtues are not working
[20:33] in the in the christians life
[20:35] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[20:37] from his old sins
[20:39] and in ephesians 4 11 and he gave some
[20:41] apostles and some prophets and some
[20:43] evangelists and some pastors and
[20:45] teachers for the perfecting of the
[20:47] saints for the work of the ministry for
[20:49] the edifying of the body of christ
[20:53] and brother wade's been speaking about
[20:55] this too we all come
[20:56] in the unity of the faith and of the
[20:58] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[21:00] perfect man unto the measure
[21:02] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[21:04] amen
[21:06] watch that that we henceforth be not
[21:08] more children tossed to and fro carried
[21:11] about with whatever wind of doctrine
[21:14] or whatever is thrown at us
[21:16] or whatever sister so-and-so tells me
[21:19] whatever brother so-and-so says or
[21:21] thinks about me we don't get tossed to
[21:23] and fro about that amen we stay focused
[21:26] and we stay concentrated
[21:29] all right
[21:31] here's a here's a here's an example of a
[21:33] weak foundation this is the tower of
[21:34] pisa in italy the foundation was made of
[21:37] limestone and lime mortar however it was
[21:39] dug only three meters deep and built on
[21:42] dense clay
[21:45] which was not a very stable place to
[21:47] build a 14 500 ton tower the weight
[21:50] started to compact the solar until it
[21:51] found the weakest point and it started
[21:53] sinking in on one side
[21:56] and so
[21:57] the foundation was the way it was
[22:00] founded or the way it was
[22:01] the foundation wasn't right so when you
[22:04] have an unstable foundation when you
[22:06] have an unbalanced foundation which if
[22:09] it's outside of the word of god it's an
[22:11] unbalanced foundation
[22:13] any viewpoint that you have or anything
[22:16] that you bring from your old life or
[22:18] from your old denomination it's
[22:19] unbalanced if it's not part of the word
[22:21] of god and when it and when your life
[22:24] starts getting rocky and starts and
[22:25] starts tilting to the side people will
[22:28] see it
[22:30] people when they go see this tower of
[22:31] pisa they see that it's leaning and
[22:33] they've tried to fix this thing uh uh
[22:36] all and they and they were able to get
[22:38] it back straight a little bit but they
[22:40] can't do it fully because it was built
[22:43] on an unstable foundation
[22:46] right
[22:46] now you take the you take the pyramids
[22:48] for example
[22:50] the foundation of the pyramids were laid
[22:52] with limestone blocks mined by mason
[22:54] using copper chisels contrary to popular
[22:57] belief the egyptians built the giza
[22:59] pyramids up from the bedrock of the
[23:01] plateau not over a flat sandy base
[23:05] khufu is one of the pyramids in fact was
[23:07] built around a small rock knoll so these
[23:10] pyramids have been there longer than the
[23:12] tara pisa and yet they're still standing
[23:14] and they're not leaning
[23:17] right they may be crumbling maybe to the
[23:18] side the elements rain and all that
[23:20] stuff but hey they're still standing
[23:22] firm
[23:24] right and what is what is our life
[23:25] supposed to be in the holy ghost
[23:27] supposed to be a firm foundation
[23:30] stature of a perfect man it's got to
[23:32] start with faith
[23:34] right
[23:35] faith in jesus christ who is the rock
[23:38] right
[23:39] faith in the word
[23:41] and that's what will help you keep keep
[23:43] you grounded and i'm just going fast now
[23:46] matthew therefore uh
[23:49] well jesus here talking about uh you
[23:51] know building your house upon a rock and
[23:53] then satan brings all these things to
[23:56] make you unstable
[23:58] unsure lost and clear puzzle confused
[24:00] baffled that's what that's what satan
[24:02] he he he he's good but now here's two
[24:05] examples about of jesus
[24:07] when when in john uh in luke 9
[24:10] uh says and john answered and said
[24:12] master we saw one casting out devils in
[24:14] thy name and we forbad him because he
[24:16] followeth not with us
[24:19] and jesus said do you see the
[24:21] instability of of john
[24:24] and jesus says to him and jesus said
[24:25] until forbid him not
[24:27] for he that is not against us is for us
[24:30] amen you see somebody jumping shouting
[24:32] and screaming and and and
[24:34] and being happy in the lord don't
[24:36] don't
[24:39] you maybe you don't understand that
[24:41] you don't need to criticize it
[24:44] you see a brother or sister that's just
[24:46] too quiet you know they don't they don't
[24:47] say amen you don't know if they're
[24:48] saying amen in their heart
[24:50] don't criticize him
[24:51] stay bound
[24:53] also jesus being asked if tribute should
[24:56] be given to caesar or not he gave a
[24:58] balanced answer he said give to caesar
[24:59] with caesars and give to god what's
[25:01] god's
[25:02] that keeps you balanced
[25:04] amen praise the lord jesus so we'll
[25:07] leave you that was those two examples
[25:08] and when i have the musicians come
[25:15] balance christianity
[25:18] balance christianity we got to be
[25:20] balanced in our lives and
[25:22] because that will keep us moving forward
[25:24] it will keep us
[25:26] have healthy relationships with one
[25:27] another
[25:29] right
[25:31] and it'll keep us growing in the grace
[25:33] and the knowledge and the faith of our
[25:34] lord and savior jesus christ god bless
[25:36] you all thank you for your
[25:57] thank you
