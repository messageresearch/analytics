[0:02] God bless you Saints and good
[0:05] morning and and my dad is doing a whole
[0:08] lot better thank you for your prayers
[0:09] he's U it's one of those strange things
[0:12] he'll forget be forgetful and can't
[0:15] remember things for few hours and then
[0:18] um they he spent a night in the hospital
[0:20] and he's doing much better now but just
[0:24] keep him in
[0:27] prayer let's see where were before we
[0:30] got interrupted by necessity Hebrews
[0:34] 13:8 Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be
[0:36] able to come together around your word
[0:38] and we just ask Lord that you'll just
[0:39] bless us this morning as we study these
[0:41] things out and guide us Lord through
[0:43] your scriptures I pray God that you'll
[0:45] just be with brother weight as he's
[0:46] prepared and studying Lord Lord guide
[0:48] our hearts and our minds Lord to be in
[0:50] the right attitude today Lord Jesus to
[0:52] hear what you have in store for us in
[0:54] your name bless us we pray
[0:57] amen so um we're getting close to
[0:59] Hebrews and uh we'll just pray pray that
[1:04] the Lord will guide me into what we're
[1:05] going to study next I've got a few
[1:07] things on on my mind um but Hebrews 13:7
[1:11] says remember then which have the rule
[1:13] over you who have spoken unto you the
[1:14] word of God whose Faith follow
[1:16] considering the end of their
[1:17] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:19] yesterday today and forever and brother
[1:23] would say in scriptural signs of the
[1:25] time remember our God is still the god
[1:27] of Elijah he is still the God that he
[1:30] ever was he's still the same God he
[1:33] moves in the same cycle he does the same
[1:35] thing he is the same God same yesterday
[1:37] today and forever I've seen them stand
[1:39] dumbfounded paralyzed and taken off the
[1:42] field God Still Remains God now wasn't
[1:46] that Elisha's testimony when he come
[1:48] after Elisha Elijah went up in the fiery
[1:50] Chariot he he he come back to that the
[1:53] the the River Jordan and said I I know
[1:56] that he's still the same yesterday today
[1:57] and forever and he took that that mantle
[2:00] and and struck the river and said where
[2:03] is the god of Elijah because he had
[2:05] confidence that God is still the same
[2:06] yesterday today and forever and he's
[2:08] still the same today and lead not unto
[2:11] thine own understanding brother R said
[2:12] if I had listened to reasons there would
[2:14] probably have been thousands of people
[2:16] died years ago but I carried a message
[2:18] exactly like he said around and around
[2:21] the world and I'm going again by the
[2:23] grace of God not by reasons but by
[2:26] commission Hallelujah I lean not you say
[2:29] you're 55 years old if I was 95 that
[2:33] don't mean a thing he is still the same
[2:35] God that he was with Abraham yes sir and
[2:40] what a confidence we can have this
[2:41] morning that he is still the same that
[2:43] he always was and in Hebrews
[2:46] 139 Paul says be not carried about with
[2:50] diverse and strange doctrines now all
[2:53] these different kind of things that you
[2:54] could believe about different voices for
[2:57] it is a good thing that the heart be
[2:59] established Lish with Grace not with
[3:01] meat Meats which have not profited them
[3:04] that have been occupied therein we have
[3:06] an
[3:07] altar whereof they have no right to eat
[3:11] which serve the Tabernacle now look what
[3:13] he's saying let's not be established
[3:16] with Meats now you know the Old
[3:18] Testament they had all these
[3:20] requirements of different kinds of food
[3:21] that you could eat you could eat clean
[3:23] food you could eat vegetables with
[3:25] fruits and nuts and honey and milk and
[3:27] butter and eggs and cheese imagine even
[3:29] to this day the the the Hebrews the Jews
[3:31] are so careful not to mix this kind when
[3:34] they're preparing their food they don't
[3:36] mix this kind of food with this kind of
[3:37] food the the everything's got to be
[3:40] prepared in just a certain way better
[3:43] not eat any rabbits hairs and rodents no
[3:46] web footed birds and their eggs and so
[3:48] they were very focused on all this on
[3:51] all the structure of the law the dos and
[3:52] the don'ts and and they they've got they
[3:55] had they've got their rule book now
[3:57] maybe this morning there's many of us
[3:59] that might have have a a rule book that
[4:00] we're trying to follow trying to live
[4:02] our life by a rule book but that's not
[4:05] the new test that's not the New
[4:06] Testament the New Covenant is not living
[4:08] your life by a rule book now look what
[4:11] if if we read from the from the new
[4:13] international Readers version of what
[4:15] Paul's trying to say he said don't be
[4:16] carried away by all kinds of strange
[4:18] teachings it's good that God's grace
[4:20] makes our heart strong don't depend on
[4:24] Foods the law requires they have no
[4:25] value for the people who eat them so in
[4:28] other words if we could kind of distin
[4:29] that down into what he's trying to say
[4:31] salvation is not based on a list of
[4:33] rules that we have to follow you're not
[4:36] you're not bringing uh you know the
[4:38] Christian Life will produce fruits it
[4:40] will produce fruits but you don't start
[4:42] off your journey by bringing your fruits
[4:44] that's where Kane messed up in it he
[4:46] thought well I I want to I want to be a
[4:48] good person I want to I want to I want
[4:49] to you know I'm trying to trying to do
[4:52] trying to manufacture a good life so to
[4:56] speak we'll put it like that and he
[4:57] brought his fruits first and tried to
[5:00] make that the offering but that's not
[5:02] how we come you come you come like Abel
[5:05] did identifying yourself with your
[5:07] sacrifice crying and balling and dying
[5:10] out to yourself and and that's how you
[5:12] start your journey and then the fruits
[5:14] will manifest from
[5:15] that amen look what Paul's saying it's a
[5:18] good thing that the heart be established
[5:19] with Grace not with meech which which
[5:22] have not profited them that have been
[5:23] occupied therein spiritual power and
[5:25] growth come from God's grace rather than
[5:29] adherence to rituals or laws
[5:31] transformation and power comes from
[5:33] within through God's grace rather than
[5:35] external observances what's Paul hitting
[5:38] at that legalistic mindset that when you
[5:41] come to the house of God or in your
[5:42] Christian Journey you've got a l a bunch
[5:44] of rules you got to keep rule rules
[5:47] won't get you anywhere well let's look
[5:49] at some of the traits of legalism if you
[5:51] got that legalistic mindset it makes you
[5:54] self-righteous or you're trying to find
[5:55] somebody you you've got your list of
[5:57] rules and you start pointing with that
[5:58] finger well you're not keeping the rules
[6:00] that I think you should be keeping at
[6:02] when you start judging the other person
[6:04] it gives you that judgmental attitude
[6:05] you're quick to criticize or condemn
[6:07] others often without understanding or
[6:09] empathy see what legalism does it takes
[6:11] away your empathy you don't really care
[6:13] about the other person all you're caring
[6:15] about is that rule keeping you're caring
[6:17] about the you're caring about the rules
[6:20] could you imagine if if uh when David
[6:23] was hungry and he ran and and he he went
[6:25] to he found the Tabernacle and he ate of
[6:28] the showbread in the in the Tabernacle
[6:30] which was only lawful for the priest to
[6:32] eat if you're if you're looking at it
[6:34] from a legalistic standpoint you'll say
[6:37] well I know you're hungry and you're
[6:39] about famished but my rule book says
[6:42] that you can't have any food you see how
[6:44] the devil will twist something something
[6:47] that could be good and twist it because
[6:48] you're you're looking at it from the
[6:50] wrong you're from the wrong perspective
[6:52] that legalism makes you you won't have
[6:54] any compassion like like somebody that's
[6:56] just legalistic no David sorry you can't
[7:00] have any you can't have any food the
[7:02] Jews there as as Jesus was going through
[7:04] the corn fields with his disciples and
[7:06] they on the sabath here you are on the
[7:08] Sabbath trying to get a little
[7:09] sustenance but our rule book says no you
[7:12] you got to you just got to be hungry no
[7:15] compassion and you become resistant to
[7:17] growth unwilling to change due to fear
[7:21] comfort and familiarity or closed
[7:23] mindedness and legalism makes you
[7:25] motivated by fear following rules more
[7:28] out of fear of punishment or judgment
[7:30] than out of love or understanding now
[7:32] that's what a legalistic mindset will do
[7:34] you're you're you're just com I got to
[7:36] do this or I'm going to get in trouble I
[7:38] got to I got to follow this rule or I'm
[7:40] going to lose my salvation if I don't
[7:42] follow this Rule and you've got your
[7:44] little rule book say you got to you got
[7:45] to adhere to now that's what Paul is
[7:48] adhering at in Romans 14: 13-1 17 he
[7:52] said let us not therefore judge one
[7:54] another anymore but judge this rather
[7:58] that no man put us stumbling block or an
[8:00] occasion to fall in his brother's way I
[8:03] know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus
[8:05] that there is nothing unclean of itself
[8:07] but to him that esteemeth anything to be
[8:09] unclean to him it is unclean But If thy
[8:12] brother be grieved with thy meat now
[8:14] walst thou not charitably destroy not
[8:16] him with thy meat for whom Christ died
[8:19] let not then your good be evil spoken of
[8:22] for the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[8:24] drink but righteousness and peace and
[8:27] joy in the Holy Ghost right what's
[8:30] what's he talking about you you can't
[8:32] make somebody be a Christian by putting
[8:34] them in a headlock and making them not
[8:36] eat or or you know it's got to be
[8:39] something that God's word produces in
[8:41] their life something natural because you
[8:42] can't come like Cain with your fruits
[8:44] first you got to come like Abel with
[8:46] your sacrifice first and then it will
[8:48] work out the way that it's supposed to
[8:50] that's right there's the pattern in
[8:52] Matthew chapter 23 Jesus said woe unto
[8:55] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[8:57] you pay tithe of mint and Anis and cumin
[8:59] and and have admitted the weightier
[9:00] matters of the law judgment mercy and
[9:02] Faith these ought you to have done and
[9:04] not to leave the other undone you blind
[9:06] guides would strain at a KN and swallow
[9:09] a camel they had they had forgotten
[9:12] they've beg gotten so wrapped up in
[9:13] their legalistic mindset that they
[9:15] forgot about just being good people they
[9:18] forgot about they forgot about judgment
[9:20] being be looking looking at things from
[9:22] a a a a right attitude they forgot about
[9:25] showing Mercy they forgot about showing
[9:27] Faith but they were so wound up in doing
[9:30] the taking taking care of tithing their
[9:32] little the little herbs and their little
[9:34] spices but he was saying you should do
[9:36] both of those things you should take
[9:38] care of the T tithe what you're supposed
[9:40] to tithe but also don't forget to just
[9:42] be be good and righteous righteous and
[9:45] loving to one another do all the things
[9:47] that that really the law was actually
[9:49] speaking of and that's why in second
[9:51] Corinthians Paul tells us that the
[9:54] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[9:57] and you can see there that the letter if
[9:59] you don't have the spirit to Quicken it
[10:01] and and really give the true
[10:03] interpretation you could be you could be
[10:05] like uh uh maybe a legalistic priest
[10:08] when David comes running up want some
[10:10] food and You' be ready to kill him
[10:12] because I'm sorry you just can't have
[10:14] any food or maybe like the Pharisee that
[10:16] says well uh I'm sorry you can't have
[10:19] any corn for my field because it's the
[10:21] Sabbath day and you're just going to
[10:22] have to starve I'm sorry and that's how
[10:25] the letter kills because it that you
[10:27] don't have the right inter ration of it
[10:30] the right interpretation will make
[10:31] somebody willing to sacrifice themselves
[10:34] willing to lay down their life for their
[10:36] brother willing to give up things so
[10:38] that somebody else can have it willing
[10:40] to willing to do good and love and and
[10:43] love one another that's that's what real
[10:46] Christianity is about now now here we've
[10:48] got the story in Matthew
[10:50] 121:4 that says where you got to got a
[10:53] picture of real legalism Jesus and his
[10:55] disciples going through that
[10:57] cornfield at that time time Jesus went
[10:59] on the Sabbath day through the corn and
[11:01] his disciples were in hunger and began
[11:02] to pluck the ears of corn and to eat but
[11:05] when the Pharisees saw it they said unto
[11:07] him Behold thy disciples do that which
[11:10] is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day
[11:13] but he said unto them have ye not read
[11:15] what David did when he was in hunger and
[11:17] they that were with him how he entered
[11:19] into the house of God and did eat the
[11:21] Sho bread which was not lawful for him
[11:23] to eat Nei neither for them which were
[11:26] with him but only for the priest
[11:29] only for the priest and that legalistic
[11:32] mindset there they they they could not
[11:34] fathom that Jesus could go isn't that
[11:36] interesting how the Pharisees had such a
[11:38] legalistic mindset such a twisted view
[11:40] that they could see Jesus healing
[11:42] somebody in the next to the pool of
[11:43] Bethesda on the Sabbath day and they
[11:45] think there's something wrong with that
[11:47] that their Viewpoint was looking at
[11:49] something good the son of man coming and
[11:51] doing something good and they looked at
[11:53] it from an evil perspective right I I
[11:56] think sometimes how you know even in
[11:58] church you can you can sit everybody's
[12:00] listening through a different filter you
[12:02] know one I I I got to minister at this
[12:05] one Church where there's a brother that
[12:07] everybody knew in the church he had left
[12:08] the message and he didn't he he was
[12:10] sitting in the church disbelieving and
[12:12] I'm sitting there preaching away at him
[12:14] and everybody's got they're listening
[12:16] through their different filter Believers
[12:18] and here's a everybody knows he's an
[12:20] unbeliever it's not a secret and he's
[12:22] sitting there but he's amening but he's
[12:25] amening through his filter I I'll say
[12:28] something like you got to have a real
[12:29] revelation of God for yourself and he'll
[12:31] my my wife's sitting in front of him so
[12:33] she could hear him behind him amen but
[12:35] she knows that he's amening from a
[12:38] position of disbelief because he's not
[12:40] really believing what I'm saying he's
[12:42] believing from his
[12:44] perspective now see how you can the
[12:46] Pharisees there they're they're they're
[12:47] listening they're they're they're
[12:49] looking at the word from their filter
[12:51] from their a different kind of
[12:53] understanding and it twists it it twists
[12:55] the meaning of it so you can come I you
[12:58] know i' I was talking to a minister up
[13:00] in Ohio one time and he really he said
[13:02] something that really stuck with me I I
[13:03] want to be known for what I'm for not
[13:06] for what I'm against because see the
[13:08] Pharisees the Pharisees they they got it
[13:11] in their mind that they're just against
[13:12] something and you can come into church
[13:14] and you're just against everything and
[13:15] you're you're not you you lose sight of
[13:17] what you're really for I want to be for
[13:20] something I I was reading last night
[13:22] about that story brother R I'm telling
[13:24] the little story of the of the little
[13:26] boy on the bicycle and and uh all the
[13:29] other kids were making fun of him and
[13:31] and uh and you know they could ride
[13:33] their bikes with with no handlebars but
[13:35] he got on up on that plank and he began
[13:37] to look at the destination where he's
[13:39] going and he began to pedal and he got
[13:41] to the end of it and they began to how
[13:43] did you do it and he said well I I
[13:46] wasn't looking at what my situation how
[13:49] it was maybe less than ideal maybe my
[13:51] situation was maybe not exactly the way
[13:53] that I would want it but yet I'm looking
[13:55] at the destination where I'm going and
[13:57] our destination where where we're going
[13:59] is we're going to a Rapture we're going
[14:01] to a body change and we we don't look at
[14:04] the obstacles and everything because
[14:05] we're for something we're not against
[14:08] everything right look look at this
[14:10] mindset this is the that legalistic
[14:12] phical mindset where you just start
[14:15] looking looking at everything from a
[14:16] negative perspective and and
[14:18] everything's everything's got to be a
[14:20] challenge you everything your whole
[14:21] journey is you got to be against
[14:23] somebody or against something do you
[14:24] want to be against this do you want to
[14:26] be against that I'm against this other
[14:28] church I'm against this Doctrine against
[14:29] everything but but if you can get break
[14:32] out of that and be for something be for
[14:35] Christ be for living a real Godly life
[14:37] being a be for for being a real
[14:40] Christian then we'll get somewhere and
[14:43] what is being a real Christian in Romans
[14:45] chapter 12 it says do not be Paul said
[14:48] do not be overcome by evil but overcome
[14:51] evil with
[14:53] good now see see the difference between
[14:56] Cain and Abel and the Pharisees and
[15:00] Jesus they the Pharisees thought they
[15:02] were being good but they were actually
[15:06] horrible evil and a and real
[15:09] Christianity is good it's willing to lay
[15:11] down your life for somebody else it's
[15:13] willing to do something when everybody
[15:15] else wrong you you're willing to reward
[15:17] evil with good in every circumstance to
[15:20] not say something about somebody not do
[15:22] something harmful and Ephesians 4:29 let
[15:25] no corrupting talk come out of your
[15:27] mouths but only such as is good for
[15:30] building up as fits the occasion that it
[15:32] may give Grace to those who hear
[15:35] Galatians 5:22 says but the fruit of the
[15:38] spirit is love joy peace patience
[15:41] kindness goodness faithfulness
[15:43] gentleness self-control against such
[15:45] things there is no law but you don't
[15:48] bring your fruits as your
[15:50] sacrifice the fruits is the end of the
[15:53] story that's where Cain got messed up in
[15:57] 1 Thessalonians 5: 15 see that no one
[15:59] repays anyone evil for evil but always
[16:02] seek to do good to one another and to
[16:04] everyone and James 3:17 it says but the
[16:07] wisdom from above is first pure then
[16:10] Peaceable gentle open to reason full of
[16:13] mercy and good fruits impartial and
[16:16] sincere in 1 Peter 3:11 let him turn
[16:20] away from Evil and do good let him seek
[16:22] peace and pursue it it's peace peace and
[16:27] Reconciliation and love and goodness are
[16:30] all the things that the gospel is
[16:33] proclaiming that's why God keeps his
[16:35] word brother said God has a program and
[16:38] that program is written in his word and
[16:40] his word said we should be one all
[16:43] together not a divided divisions and
[16:45] fusses and stews but we should be one
[16:48] Christ prayed that we would be one and
[16:49] he said this will all men know you are
[16:51] my disciples when you have love one for
[16:53] the other now here's the thing that
[16:56] really I is a sticking point how how can
[16:59] gifts and signs work in a
[17:04] church how can God perfect his church
[17:07] when there is so much Division division
[17:08] Among
[17:09] Us how can when one says this and one
[17:12] says that and one says something else
[17:14] and all contrary one to the other there
[17:16] is one supreme judge that's God's
[17:19] Eternal Everlasting word and God keeps
[17:21] his word so quicker we can line up with
[17:24] that word the better off we'll be God
[17:26] keeps his word what is this trying to
[17:29] express that you can get all wrapped up
[17:31] in everything that you're against or you
[17:32] can be for something now that's what
[17:34] happened on the day of Pentecost they
[17:36] forgot what they were against and they
[17:38] begin to set their eyes on what they
[17:39] were for they wanted to see the spirit
[17:42] and the power of God fall and they begin
[17:43] to look in with one Accord with one goal
[17:46] toward toward that goal and that's how
[17:49] you see the spirit of God fall in a
[17:52] congregation you can almost say this
[17:54] might sound negative you will never see
[17:56] people speaking tongues you will never
[17:58] see see a move of the spirit when you've
[18:00] got a divided congregation you will
[18:02] never see people run up and down the
[18:04] aisle you will never see people lift up
[18:06] their hands in Liberty and worship God
[18:08] when you've got people that are divided
[18:10] but when you people have have a group of
[18:12] people that are in one Accord looking
[18:14] toward a common goal looking to Christ
[18:16] like that little boy on the bicycle then
[18:18] you'll see Liberty then you'll see God
[18:20] begin to move on the scene but you'll
[18:22] never have that in a divided
[18:24] congregation you can almost say that
[18:26] that's thus sayith the Lord you will
[18:27] never have God move in a congregation
[18:30] that's divided you must set your sight
[18:31] on Christ and look to him look to him
[18:34] with one Accord and look for for
[18:37] something not with for not against
[18:39] something that's how he said all men
[18:41] will know you're my disciples when you
[18:44] love one for the other the world's so
[18:46] thirsty for that friend and God is love
[18:48] until we can get Brotherly Love we'll
[18:50] never get very far with God we need a
[18:54] Revival of Love amongst the children of
[18:56] God love is what we need
[18:59] that's why in 1 Corinthians 13:2 Paul
[19:02] said and though I have the gift of
[19:03] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[19:06] like like like the Pharisees like the
[19:09] Jews they understood all the things that
[19:11] by the letter in the Bible they
[19:13] understood all those things but what
[19:14] good does it do if you don't have the
[19:16] true correct interpretation where you
[19:18] can love somebody that hates you where
[19:19] you can lay down your life for somebody
[19:21] that that that says something wrong
[19:23] about you right all and though I have
[19:26] all Faith so that I could remove
[19:27] mountains and have not charity I am
[19:30] nothing we are nothing without love love
[19:33] will make you give up something for
[19:35] somebody else in Hebrews 13:10 he says
[19:38] we have an altar whereof they have no
[19:40] right to eat which serve the Tabernacle
[19:43] now let's examine that and see what it
[19:45] says see what it
[19:47] means we have an altar where of they
[19:49] have no right to eat which serve the
[19:51] Tabernacle the altar is where the
[19:54] sacrifice is made so what that means is
[19:58] those who continue to adhere to that
[20:00] legalistic way of thinking symbolized by
[20:02] serving the Tabernacle with their rules
[20:04] with their list of rules that they've
[20:06] got to adhere to do not have access to
[20:08] the spiritual benefits you don't have
[20:11] any right to eat of the New Covenant if
[20:13] you're still serving that that that Old
[20:15] Testament rule book that where you've
[20:17] got a list of things that that you
[20:20] you're trying to adhere to you have no
[20:21] right to eat of that new covenant the
[20:23] promises of the New
[20:25] Covenant and Hebrew and Paul goes on in
[20:27] verse 11 for the bodies of those beasts
[20:29] whose blood is brought into the
[20:31] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[20:33] burned without the camp wherefore Jesus
[20:35] also that he might sanctify the people
[20:37] with his own blood suffered without the
[20:39] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[20:42] without the camp bearing his reproach
[20:46] for here we have no continuing City but
[20:49] we seek one to
[20:53] come now in the Old
[20:56] Testament when they sacrificed an animal
[20:59] they would take it like in Leviticus
[21:03] 41:12 when they would make a sin
[21:05] offering for the priest or sin offering
[21:07] for the
[21:08] congregation they would take the blood
[21:10] and they would offer it on the Altar and
[21:11] then they would take the animal skin and
[21:14] all the pertinence and they would take
[21:16] it outside of the
[21:17] camp to a clean place and they would
[21:19] burn the ashes and burn it on the burn
[21:22] them on the wood with fire where the
[21:24] ashes are poured
[21:25] out and then again when you you you had
[21:28] the scapegoat that would uh go free Into
[21:31] the Wilderness and and the the other
[21:33] goat was offered as a as a sin offering
[21:36] they would take that uh the skin of that
[21:39] animal and they would carry it forth
[21:40] without the
[21:42] camp and that's a type of Jesus when he
[21:45] was offered up you can see here this map
[21:48] of Jerusalem that outside of the gate
[21:50] they took him and they offered him up
[21:52] there at gtha which was outside outside
[21:55] of the
[21:56] walls and brother AB would say I know
[21:58] there is some reason that people are not
[22:00] getting through to Christ if they would
[22:02] they wouldn't act like that Jesus
[22:05] suffered without the gates that he might
[22:07] sanctify his people with his own blood
[22:09] sanctification comes from a Greek word
[22:12] compound which means cleaned and set
[22:14] aside for service and when God cleans
[22:17] his people with the blood of Jesus he
[22:19] cleans them from the filth of the world
[22:22] and sets them aside for
[22:25] service and going beyond the camp said
[22:28] it seems today to be a day of when
[22:30] people are going beyond the camp and
[22:31] everything they're going Beyond you know
[22:34] I was told some time ago that they had a
[22:36] jet plane now that can make them noises
[22:38] we hear around here that shakes the
[22:39] windows it's when the plane has got so
[22:42] fast that it crosses its own sound
[22:44] called sound barrier and when it goes
[22:46] beyond its own sound barrier it's almost
[22:48] unlimited to what it'll do and I think
[22:50] in there that we get a lesson when we go
[22:52] beyond our own sound barrier into the
[22:54] word of God then it's unlimited what God
[22:57] can do with a man that's ready to go
[22:59] beyond the camp the camp of man that is
[23:03] now we see that going beyond the camp
[23:05] going Beyond this and then again he said
[23:08] 3,000 years ago a man can meet God most
[23:11] anywhere it was a common thing for a man
[23:14] to meet God but why don't they meet him
[23:16] today in the case of Abraham and in his
[23:18] Camp why it was almost an everyday
[23:20] occasion that Abraham met God he talked
[23:23] to him not only that but when they went
[23:24] down into guar to sojourn we find out
[23:27] down there that guar was in the camp
[23:29] with ailec a Philistine it was a very
[23:32] common thing they lived in the camp of
[23:36] his presence what's he talking about if
[23:38] you go go beyond everybody's got camps
[23:41] you got a little Camp of your own ideas
[23:43] you camp your Camp of man but if you can
[23:45] get past that camp of your own ideas and
[23:48] your own thoughts and get into the camp
[23:49] of God then you can have Fellowship
[23:52] continually go with God get past all
[23:55] break past that sound barrier and and
[23:58] and and begin to fellowship with God and
[24:01] and again he said so notice he rebuked
[24:03] them and they put him out of their Camp
[24:05] Jesus suffered without the camp they put
[24:07] him out of the camp outside Way Beyond
[24:09] their camp we find out that the Bible
[24:12] said in this last day under this leay
[24:14] out ofy and age they would do the same
[24:16] thing they would be put out of the camp
[24:20] now watch what he says to do now in
[24:21] closing put out of the camp where the
[24:24] sacrifices was burned that's where he
[24:27] Bel
[24:29] he was the
[24:32] sacrifice he said now brother sister do
[24:34] you know that each one of you all must
[24:36] sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice
[24:40] sacrifice the things of the world
[24:42] sacrifice your own pleasures of this
[24:43] world sacrifice the things of the world
[24:46] you know the reason that people won't do
[24:48] it he said we're not asked to
[24:50] manufacture something that's Cain
[24:52] bringing his fruits we're asked to Bear
[24:55] the fruit of the spirit that is the ins
[24:57] side of the sheep what he is on the
[25:00] inside makes the wool on the outside and
[25:03] when a man has got Christ on the inside
[25:06] it makes him Christlike on the outside
[25:09] not some artificial put on that
[25:12] artificial put on is that legalistic
[25:14] Pharisee is trying to fake it trying to
[25:17] trying to put the the real feathers in
[25:19] his you know trying to trying to act
[25:21] like something that he's not but a real
[25:24] a real
[25:26] genuine a real genuine Holy Ghost
[25:28] experience will make the letter it it
[25:30] will take the letter and produce produce
[25:34] something
[25:35] real and we'll stop right there God
[25:37] bless you Saints
[25:40] [Applause]
[25:52] amen
