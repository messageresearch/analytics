[4:32] you
[4:33] we just ask you now that you'd come on
[4:35] this scene today as we try to speak
[4:37] about you
[4:38] and as we try to get to people's minds
[4:41] into the thought of what you would have

[5:05] delivered us from destruction so we
[5:07] believe it we pray now you'd bless and
[5:09] open our eyes that we may be able to see
[5:12] in Jesus name amen
[5:15] Romans 8
[5:19] you'll begin reading in verse 28.
[5:24] and we know that all things work
[5:26] together for good to them that love God
[5:28] and to them who are thee now what
[5:31] singular
[5:33] he called according to his purpose for
[5:36] whom he did for no he also did
[5:39] predestinate to be conformed to the
[5:41] image of his son
[5:43] that he might be the firstborn among
[5:45] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[5:48] predestinate them he also called in whom
[5:51] he called them he also justified in whom
[5:54] he justified then he also glorified now
[5:57] I like this summing it up said what
[6:00] shall we say then to these things
[6:02] what can we say to all of that
[6:05] if God be for us who can be against us
[6:08] drop over to the ninth uh chapter verse
[6:12] 6.
[6:13] not as though the word of God had taken
[6:15] none effect
[6:16] for they are not all Israel which are of
[6:19] Israel
[6:21] neither because they are the Seed of
[6:24] Abraham
[6:25] are they all children
[6:27] but in Isaac shall I see be called
[6:31] that is they which are the children of
[6:34] the flesh
[6:35] these are not the children of God now
[6:38] why is there so much Doctrine in the
[6:40] message of of seed lean into flesh
[6:43] if you happen to be born from uh
[6:47] Adam you can be saved but if you can't
[6:49] be be born from the Beast you can't be
[6:51] saved why is it dark when he says the
[6:54] flesh don't have anything to it
[6:55] because the the children of the flesh
[6:59] are not the children of God but the
[7:01] children of the promises are counted for
[7:04] the seed for This Is The Word of Promise
[7:06] at this time will I come and say or
[7:09] she'll have a son
[7:10] not only this but they but when Rebecca
[7:13] also had conceived by one even by Our
[7:17] Father Isaac
[7:19] so he's showing that the Mom and Daddy
[7:22] was pure everything was right
[7:24] why would it fall one Jacob when he saw
[7:27] okay
[7:29] for the children being not yet born
[7:30] neither have done having done any good
[7:33] or evil that the purpose of God
[7:35] according to election might stand
[7:37] not of works but of him that call it it
[7:41] was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve
[7:43] the younger as it is written Jacob have
[7:46] I loved but he saw him I hated I mean
[7:49] you may be seated the Lord had his
[7:51] Blessing to the reading of the word
[7:54] now we've been on this
[7:57] thought this is the third message and I
[8:01] come in every day and give it to him and
[8:03] in the back back there and say well you
[8:06] know we just got the same old notes
[8:08] we've had for three services and we just
[8:11] keep moving off a few quotes and keep
[8:13] moving on Down the Line
[8:15] trying to understand because what are we
[8:17] talking about
[8:20] we're talking about how does God
[8:24] predestinate
[8:26] simple thought simple form
[8:29] we know the Bible says he does we've
[8:32] just got through reading it that he did
[8:34] well how does he predestinate
[8:38] and in doing that how could he
[8:40] predestinate
[8:42] without
[8:44] um
[8:45] choosing sides
[8:47] are choosing some people as the doctrine
[8:50] of predestination is you know that some
[8:52] people are predetermined to be saved
[8:54] some are predetermined to be lost
[8:56] Prophet said well that's a false
[8:59] Doctrine you know the garbage can
[9:01] doctrine of predestination but that's
[9:04] doctrines that's the way people do and
[9:07] they won't take anything else as I said
[9:10] the other day there used to be a Baptist
[9:13] Doctrine back in the Independence Day or
[9:15] that they wouldn't even have take their
[9:17] kids to a Revival
[9:18] because they was afraid the kids might
[9:20] get saved when it was not the will of
[9:22] God for them to get saved
[9:24] you say well that sure is done
[9:27] well not much dumber than what's going
[9:30] on now around the message the seed
[9:33] doctrines and the ideas they have you
[9:35] know and the stuff like that so it's
[9:38] just the same old devil he just moves up
[9:40] and gets into a different Realm
[9:42] but talking about
[9:44] how does God then predestinate
[9:50] is it because you're a good person
[9:53] did he save you because you were good
[9:56] you know what did he say to you because
[9:58] he's bad
[10:01] you know we don't really want to go
[10:03] neither way right
[10:05] we want to go according to the word
[10:08] and I hope you'll listen especially if I
[10:10] get that far
[10:12] if not we'll take it up later but the
[10:15] next message following this one I want
[10:17] you to uh really listen to it
[10:21] about the mind of God we will do that
[10:24] maybe this afternoon but I don't know
[10:26] all right
[10:28] foreknowledge as I said
[10:30] is dependent upon the basis of whether
[10:33] or not we believe that God is infinite
[10:36] amen
[10:38] omniscient
[10:39] omnipresence and all of the things we've
[10:42] been through all of that
[10:45] and it's according to whether or not we
[10:47] can believe that there is a God
[10:49] our gods
[10:52] see if we don't believe in the infinite
[10:54] God we can believe in God's
[10:56] many of them you know would just have
[10:58] anything we want
[11:00] but if we're going to believe in one
[11:01] true and living God
[11:03] then we've got to believe that he's
[11:04] infinite
[11:07] never can have another thought
[11:10] he can't change his mind
[11:14] he he's no way he can and still be God
[11:18] so then if he once says anything that's
[11:20] it
[11:22] I like the way the prophet said it and I
[11:24] told you boy knock me for a loot when
[11:26] you know he said one day he said if you
[11:28] can find it in the word of God
[11:30] he said you can call God on the scene
[11:33] and said if he don't do it you can call
[11:35] him a liar
[11:37] that's that's that's what you call faith
[11:40] in God Amen you know I mean that a man
[11:43] talking like that has got to be one
[11:45] that's had a lot of experiences you know
[11:47] and knowing that God is real and God
[11:50] will keep his word all right well see
[11:53] then if we can believe it
[11:54] then predestination
[11:58] as the prophet would say is
[12:01] a bad word to be used before untrained
[12:03] congregations
[12:05] he said really it should be you know we
[12:07] should use for for knowledge all right
[12:11] for knowledge is what
[12:15] it's the fact or act or whatever oh you
[12:18] wouldn't want to call it
[12:19] knowing what will take place
[12:23] before it takes place
[12:27] having knowledge before
[12:30] is foreknowledge
[12:32] all right now we've read these in a
[12:34] minute we'll get back to it I told you
[12:36] that
[12:38] we look at predestination
[12:41] we see we can back up further
[12:44] now I know I preached her
[12:48] last message or one back in there and I
[12:51] laid down a few things that
[12:53] I don't believe some of you ever thought
[12:55] about
[12:57] but
[12:58] we'll get back and try to show that and
[13:00] prove it but
[13:02] see the way I look at foreknowledge
[13:07] as you look back and you see
[13:10] that
[13:11] God foreknew all things all right
[13:15] now then
[13:17] did he predestinate
[13:20] that is illustrating
[13:24] did he predestinate first or is for
[13:26] knowledge first that's right
[13:29] that's right
[13:30] because see if you go with predestinate
[13:32] first
[13:34] then everything is predetermined to be
[13:37] right and you have no choice there is
[13:39] nothing for you to do you just
[13:41] haphazardly go along and if you happen
[13:43] to fall off the right tree you know
[13:46] maybe some reason or something maybe God
[13:49] might save you
[13:51] but if we go to foreknowledge
[13:55] and have foreknowledge before
[13:57] predestination now you're going into the
[14:00] channel of what the prophet is bringing
[14:03] so let's read them
[14:04] and then because I keep putting that
[14:06] back in there
[14:10] let's go to numbers it's number seven we
[14:12] we did get six of them read so far
[14:15] number seven forgive me
[14:18] I say either put in cough drop or shut
[14:20] up
[14:21] so I put in cough drops
[14:24] sorry about that
[14:27] if you got some other way of getting me
[14:29] to where I don't care so much I'll take
[14:31] care of that look what the prophet has
[14:33] to say off of the message God's covenant
[14:36] with Abraham in this seed 56 223 you're
[14:39] going into e15.
[14:42] now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just
[14:44] for haphazard thought we allowed out to
[14:47] our perhaps maybe somebody will feel
[14:49] sorry for me
[14:51] and come down and get saved now he
[14:53] didn't do it that way no no God don't
[14:56] run his office like that
[14:58] you don't run your office like that
[15:00] Jesus come for one specific purpose
[15:04] that was the redeemed those that God
[15:06] foreknew would be redeemed amen all
[15:11] right
[15:11] now you said see now God's not willing
[15:14] that any should perish
[15:16] but that all would come to repentance
[15:19] but in order to be God
[15:21] he had to know in other word
[15:23] predestinate is as is used in Ephesians
[15:26] 1 5.
[15:28] predestinate there isn't a good word
[15:31] it means in speaking of predestination
[15:34] to the people
[15:36] sometimes leads them to think that God
[15:39] just predestinates predestinated you
[15:42] push you through a little path or
[15:45] something that's not right
[15:48] predestination looks back to
[15:50] foreknowledge
[15:51] and foreknowledge looks to Destiny I
[15:54] think there's five times
[15:56] five or six times of that direct
[15:58] statement
[15:59] everywhere from the 50s up to the
[16:04] 63-64. all right
[16:07] now
[16:09] and we don't look at predestination
[16:13] we look at foreknowledge
[16:16] our knowledge before
[16:19] well
[16:21] then once we get into that
[16:23] we can see that it's not dependent then
[16:26] upon
[16:31] God doing something before
[16:36] it's dependent upon him knowing
[16:39] what will take place amen
[16:42] wasn't that simple to me you know
[16:46] if I didn't believe in God like that
[16:48] that you didn't know the end from the
[16:50] beginning didn't
[16:52] right
[16:52] um he's not much better off than I am
[16:54] sure I wouldn't worry about it
[16:58] see I believe that he forn you all
[17:00] things well that's what he says all
[17:03] right and then by his foreknowledge
[17:08] he could predestinate
[17:12] now drop a couple of points here we'll
[17:15] come back this evening
[17:20] what is the mind of God
[17:28] see what do you think about the mind of
[17:30] God
[17:33] I know people preaching and say
[17:36] if I was in the mind of God I can be
[17:39] saved
[17:41] well
[17:44] Jacob and Esau was in the mind of God
[17:53] Judas is Carrie
[17:56] was in the mind of God
[17:58] and even to prove it
[18:02] both of those are written about
[18:06] in the Bible
[18:11] so when we get back to it just laying
[18:14] that point where you'll think
[18:16] then the Bible is the mind of God
[18:21] what else you're going with
[18:25] no no he had this great mind here and
[18:28] we'll we'll try to get there one of
[18:29] these days
[18:30] but let's just keep it to the point of
[18:32] looking at it
[18:34] from what we can follow the prophet and
[18:37] the scriptures
[18:39] the prophet says that
[18:41] my foreknowledge
[18:44] God knew
[18:46] that he saw would be a shyster
[18:52] you know we spend a lot of dwellings I
[18:54] said on that
[18:57] but we don't realize that Jacob was a
[19:00] shyster amen
[19:04] right right so you got two shysters
[19:08] right
[19:10] well
[19:12] okay you said no Jacob was seed
[19:16] well
[19:22] he's always from the same
[19:26] Daddy
[19:28] so if you're gonna count your lineages
[19:31] you got to run the lineage from Daddy
[19:33] right
[19:36] you don't run too good to try to run
[19:37] into the women's side
[19:39] all right
[19:40] now
[19:41] but the point is
[19:45] if there is a God
[19:48] that is infinite
[19:51] then there could never be anything the
[19:52] prophet will stay and he knew how many
[19:55] gnats would never be in the world
[19:58] and how many times them gnats would bat
[20:00] their eye
[20:01] how much taller them gnats would make
[20:06] so we're not going to pull anything over
[20:08] on him with our doings we may be stupid
[20:10] enough to
[20:13] show who we are and what we're doing
[20:16] by trying to figure out
[20:19] the mind of God
[20:23] we'll read this afternoon we'll get down
[20:26] to it we'll run around talking about a
[20:27] little bird
[20:30] he said that little bird was so smart
[20:33] said he could say a lot of words
[20:35] did he real talk
[20:38] that man he thought I'm just as smart as
[20:42] in human beings
[20:44] he said but one day a college professor
[20:47] came in
[20:48] and started making a speech and he said
[20:51] he used some words that little bird
[20:53] couldn't understand
[20:56] so the little bird finally found out he
[20:58] wasn't smart
[21:00] well we ought to realize we're not as
[21:02] smart as God
[21:05] and he's been an argument over the times
[21:07] of to organize religion and it's even
[21:10] into the message of predestination
[21:17] so we're just talking about how does he
[21:19] do it
[21:22] so we see he does what he does by
[21:24] foreknowledge
[21:27] then by four knowledge he can
[21:29] predestinate or in other words he can
[21:32] set the destiny
[21:35] he could write in the Bible of Jacob in
[21:37] a Nissan
[21:41] and he could say before they were ever
[21:43] even born
[21:46] it would be
[21:48] he could write in the Bible
[21:51] and tell that they would have to be
[21:53] someone I'll get my point if there'd
[21:56] have to be someone
[21:57] to uh
[22:00] they'd have to be a Judas
[22:03] you know and it would speak about him in
[22:05] the Psalms of how his vows would gush
[22:08] out
[22:10] in the things
[22:12] would the Judas have a change
[22:18] well they want with the Lord for three
[22:19] and a half years
[22:21] pretty good change
[22:25] right
[22:27] amen
[22:28] and until he was such a nice guy as the
[22:30] prophet would say he would be the man of
[22:33] the year
[22:34] and said everybody voted him the
[22:36] treasure
[22:45] in pretty good position
[22:46] right
[22:48] one of the original
[22:53] but yet God knew what he would do
[22:59] well see we say that Judas couldn't be
[23:01] saved
[23:05] we saw it say that Cain couldn't be
[23:08] saved
[23:11] what the Bible said about Cain
[23:14] said would you not been accepted if
[23:16] you've done what your brother done
[23:18] you know paraphrasing it
[23:22] and we throw off on Judas as being such
[23:24] a bad egg
[23:29] but
[23:31] we don't go off on Peter for denying the
[23:33] Lord Jesus three times and then cursing
[23:36] and doing it
[23:42] was Peter
[23:44] better guy than Judas
[23:47] no
[23:49] Judas was just trying to make a little
[23:51] money
[23:54] he didn't deny Jesus he confessed him
[23:58] right
[23:59] yeah right
[24:01] did not he lead him to it
[24:07] you see Peter did not even know any
[24:09] well yet we want to make some kind of a
[24:11] line or a lineage
[24:14] to run it down
[24:17] we want to try to make something out of
[24:19] it you know
[24:20] but yet what is we make out of it
[24:23] garbage can confusion
[24:26] let's just keep reading a little bit let
[24:28] me read a good bit today okay because if
[24:30] we don't we're going to have these notes
[24:32] this evening all right
[24:34] so look at number
[24:36] eight let's read a little
[24:38] try not to comment much just read
[24:41] this is from the message the
[24:42] resurrection of Jesus 56 405 paragraph
[24:47] about brothers worry
[24:50] estranging reading taking his word now
[24:52] that God way back before the world ever
[24:54] begun I begin to see the thing unfold
[24:59] and know then
[25:01] that right there is a simplest statement
[25:03] could be made but yet an outstanding one
[25:07] that should confuse every scholar
[25:12] and Robert brain
[25:15] that'll get that across you know
[25:21] look
[25:23] how do you begin to see the thing unfold
[25:26] and no
[25:28] now
[25:29] little statement
[25:31] God didn't make a choice then amen
[25:41] amen okay it's up to you
[25:43] God could not
[25:45] could say the word predestination the
[25:47] word predestinated as I've always said
[25:49] is not a good word to use to the public
[25:51] because predestination means perhaps to
[25:53] to to predestinate things to happen
[25:57] but God could predestinate by
[25:59] foreknowledge he foreknew what would be
[26:01] not willing that any should perish but
[26:05] that all would come to repentance but
[26:07] being infinite and God
[26:10] he could predestinate
[26:12] and foretell by knowledge for knowledge
[26:15] all right
[26:16] as well as stated predestination looks
[26:19] back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge
[26:21] looks on to the destiny and God in the
[26:24] beginning could see all things the way
[26:26] it would happen
[26:28] therefore he could tell this will be
[26:30] this way and that'll be that way and
[26:33] this will be this way
[26:34] in that that way because by
[26:37] foreknowledge and once he wasn't willing
[26:42] that the left side would be wrong you
[26:44] know or you know what I mean the right
[26:46] side be right do you what see he didn't
[26:49] choose
[26:52] see that's what we make it look like
[26:54] that God chose then predetermined
[27:02] everything got to be connected to
[27:04] foreknowledge
[27:06] he said well that's that old four
[27:08] knowledge Doctrine inside of
[27:09] predestination
[27:10] well sounded like your Prophet believed
[27:13] it so you know I think I'll just go
[27:15] along with it don't you
[27:18] because listen
[27:21] if he doesn't for no
[27:23] he's not God
[27:26] and and if he doesn't if he doesn't do
[27:29] that why are we worried
[27:31] why are we trying to find what side of
[27:34] the line we fall on or we did we come
[27:36] from Adam or did we come from the Beast
[27:37] or did we come from this or did we come
[27:39] from that
[27:42] why would we even worry about it
[27:46] right
[27:47] if God's not able to keep his word
[27:49] straight then he's not God
[27:52] that's sensible
[27:55] but yeah they'll read you one if we get
[27:57] time or the prophet says people you
[28:00] could you tell them that but they
[28:02] they're not going to believe it
[28:06] you can't win an argument with words
[28:12] it wouldn't matter if you could prove by
[28:16] words
[28:17] everything about predestination or
[28:20] foreknowledge
[28:22] if it's not revealed
[28:26] we just got words all right
[28:28] and that's what they've been arguing for
[28:30] two thousand years about what did Paul
[28:32] mean predestinate
[28:34] what did God mean by predestining
[28:38] you see I thought we were coming to the
[28:40] end where that this Prophet was to take
[28:43] up all the Loose Ends and and uh you
[28:47] know place in order the scriptures amen
[28:50] I mean that's what I thought he said
[28:51] right
[28:54] right so then what are we looking at
[28:58] are we looking at it as a
[29:01] just arguing quote
[29:05] I mean
[29:07] are we looking at it as seeing God
[29:10] that's it right
[29:13] and what he's doing
[29:16] and then
[29:18] leaving it to the point
[29:20] that
[29:23] I'd like this
[29:25] I don't believe he predestinated by
[29:27] stamping something right but if he did
[29:30] Paul said how can a thing formed
[29:34] say anything about it
[29:37] that's plain enough
[29:39] we'll get back to that scripture and why
[29:41] it's written like that
[29:45] me
[29:46] to me you got to get it in order then
[29:48] you can understand what's taking place
[29:51] all right
[29:53] but he could tell what was going to be
[29:57] going down a number nine
[30:00] we're just trying to read some of these
[30:01] parts of this taken from God keeps his
[30:04] word 57 407 in the morning service
[30:06] paragraph 2 31.
[30:10] they're gone at the beginning knowed
[30:11] exactly who would be saved
[30:13] Jesus come to save those that God knew
[30:16] would be saved
[30:20] he wasn't willing that they'd be lost
[30:23] but to God he knowed who would be lost
[30:26] and who would be saved therefore he
[30:30] could predestinate not predestinate he
[30:33] by foreknowledge he could set in order
[30:36] and make everything work to his glory
[30:40] right
[30:42] so he could do it Lord It's number 10.
[30:45] questions and answers if you'll notice
[30:48] the the dates that we're doing we're
[30:50] just going up up up
[30:53] until we get on the end of the 63s and I
[30:57] questions and answers uh 1957 1006
[31:01] .
[31:02] should be paragraph 6 35.
[31:07] there are sons of God
[31:08] every man that's born in this earth is
[31:11] the son of God
[31:13] regardless of whether he's a sinner or
[31:16] what he is he's a son of God created in
[31:19] the image of God for the Praises of God
[31:22] he's created that way but God in the
[31:25] beginning and knew who would receive him
[31:27] and who would not receive him
[31:29] therefore he could predest tonight or
[31:31] not pre-dest tonight but before
[31:32] knowledge he could tell who would be
[31:34] saved and who wouldn't be saved
[31:37] for he knew which person would take up
[31:39] which spirit
[31:44] you know like I said I've heard people
[31:47] say like me and my wife would have
[31:48] another baby but
[31:51] I want to make sure it's a predestinated
[31:52] seed
[31:54] well that's pretty strong isn't it
[31:59] I mean if you think just because your
[32:01] children are even illegitimate
[32:05] I would still want them saved amen you
[32:09] know I mean don't you
[32:13] I would try to be finding some way to
[32:15] get them saved instead of trying to
[32:17] prove this much lost
[32:22] you can't do nothing with people
[32:25] look at the next one
[32:27] Queen of the South 1958 125.
[32:31] paragraph E15 and this great discussion
[32:34] he's been presenting the gospel in the
[32:36] power of the Holy Spirit and many other
[32:39] people had believed on him but as usual
[32:41] there are those who would not believe
[32:43] and the sad part of it is my brethren is
[32:47] to think of it in this light
[32:49] that those people that cannot believe
[32:52] were ordained to that condemnation
[33:02] now we're dealing with ordaining to
[33:05] condemnation
[33:10] now if you're going where you're
[33:11] predetermined look what you've got
[33:14] god making the man condemned
[33:17] but if you're going by foreknowledge
[33:23] that's right
[33:28] see the sad part of it my brother needs
[33:30] to think of it in this life those people
[33:32] that cannot believe were ordained to
[33:35] that condemnation
[33:36] that's the scripture
[33:38] see isolate that take it out you got a
[33:40] good predestination Doctrine
[33:43] that's the scripture if you're a
[33:45] Believer tonight
[33:49] amen you should bow your head in
[33:51] reverence and humbleness to thank God
[33:54] that he chose you in Christ before the
[33:57] foundation in the world
[33:59] house no man can come to me said Jesus
[34:01] except my father draws him and God by
[34:04] foreknowledge not willing that any
[34:07] should perish
[34:08] but by foreknowledge he knew who would
[34:11] so he could predestinate from the
[34:14] beginning all things
[34:17] Jesus come to save those who the father
[34:20] saw before the foundation of the world
[34:23] that would be saved
[34:26] for knowledge
[34:29] but yet do we believe in
[34:33] people that are ordained to condemnation
[34:38] and how does God ordain a person to
[34:41] condemnation
[34:46] let's go to Jude number 11 a
[34:51] Jude 1 4.
[34:53] for there are men certain men crept in
[34:56] unaware
[34:58] who were before of old
[35:00] ordained to this condemnation
[35:07] and turning the grace of our God unless
[35:09] he was just and denying the Lord God in
[35:12] our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:14] so Jude says it there were people that
[35:17] were
[35:20] ordained
[35:22] to condemnation
[35:26] another said how does God predestinate
[35:29] so we go back and see it's easy by his
[35:31] foreknowledge
[35:33] well then how does he
[35:36] condemn
[35:41] is by his foreknowledge
[35:46] you go by it any other way see you're
[35:47] going to make it wrong
[35:49] look what the prophet has to say about
[35:51] it
[35:53] living me
[35:56] this is the Lady of sin Church age page
[35:58] 347. go ahead and roll it all up you can
[36:01] read in between everybody get all of
[36:02] that and read it
[36:04] see all the scripture is mostly given
[36:06] then ever verse will be will dovetail if
[36:09] given a change
[36:10] all right he's proven up before there
[36:12] how correct the word of God is
[36:14] you know all right but how many believe
[36:16] in predestination unto election
[36:20] and reprobation under destruction
[36:24] do you believe in that
[36:28] right
[36:32] how is that done
[36:37] remember anytime you're using the word
[36:40] predestinate
[36:44] remember you back up one step in God's
[36:48] mind
[36:49] to foreknowledge
[36:53] always remember that and then when you
[36:55] read your scripture it won't give you
[36:57] any trouble
[36:59] just remember you back up a step
[37:03] now
[37:05] I don't like to do this but I like to do
[37:07] it to keep you thinking
[37:09] see once we get to foreknowledge correct
[37:12] we got to back up another step
[37:18] there's another step behind for
[37:20] knowledge
[37:24] we've got to be real careful when we get
[37:25] there to walk soft
[37:29] I like to walk soft
[37:32] my heel hurts now and if I stomp it
[37:34] it don't feel good Mr stomp it so ain't
[37:37] gonna Stomp don't do anything I'm gonna
[37:39] keep it up now you know
[37:41] let's walk soft
[37:44] but look at him see people
[37:46] no
[37:47] there's the next quote let me let me
[37:49] quote this
[37:52] and then if you want it would be page
[37:54] 357.
[37:55] another lady of sin Church age
[37:59] but not the same spirit and henceforth
[38:02] predest persecuted the child which was
[38:04] God did not reprobate for the sake of
[38:07] reparation
[38:10] now God didn't reprobate for the sake of
[38:12] reprobation
[38:13] in other words he didn't make something
[38:15] right right that away
[38:19] he didn't make reprobate because I told
[38:21] you my brother
[38:22] he says God made me a sinner he can't
[38:25] condemn me for being a sinner
[38:29] I said God didn't make you a sinner
[38:33] you made your own choice you're a free
[38:36] moral agent when she reached that you
[38:38] become a sinner you wasn't The Sinner
[38:39] before that
[38:41] the fact of free moral agency
[38:43] God never put us in the pawn shop
[38:46] we put ourselves in the pawn shop you'll
[38:49] get that straight it'll work a whole lot
[38:51] but look what he says
[38:54] people don't believe in it maybe but
[38:56] many people
[38:58] but how many believe in predestination
[39:00] under election and Reformation under
[39:02] destruction
[39:03] which one he says those who don't
[39:08] those who don't believe that
[39:11] what will they do
[39:14] well they listen no
[39:17] no see that's out on the hour now or
[39:19] even right here in your mind you're
[39:21] sitting there wiped out to the point of
[39:23] what's being said
[39:25] and you're refusing to listen
[39:28] amen well I'm hearing your words
[39:31] you can hear words all day long
[39:33] and not know what's going on
[39:38] come on
[39:40] those who don't those who don't believe
[39:42] in it will listen no they will not yet
[39:45] both are in the word and nothing will
[39:47] change
[39:48] but to learn about it and reconcile the
[39:50] truth of those doctrines with other
[39:52] truths that seem to oppose
[39:55] they will not take the time
[39:59] to try to bring it together it won't do
[40:01] it but they stopped their ears and
[40:03] mashed with their teeth
[40:05] and they lose out at the end of this age
[40:08] a prophet will come
[40:09] but they will be blind to all that he is
[40:12] doing and saying
[40:15] they are so sure they're right
[40:19] and in their blindness
[40:20] they will lose it all right
[40:24] and what about people
[40:27] refusing
[40:28] the truth
[40:33] refusing to believe yeah but brother
[40:35] Dale I've heard social principal
[40:37] predestination
[40:39] boy you got a beautiful job
[40:46] but what did you wind up with
[40:50] what I did is you conceive out of all
[40:53] the predestination ideas that you've
[40:55] heard
[40:58] will you not admit
[41:00] admit
[41:05] that it always pumps the place
[41:08] it always deals with the flesh
[41:14] you'll always deal your predestination
[41:16] doctors will always deal with the flesh
[41:19] and they'll go to the flesh
[41:22] that's why you got the polygamies in the
[41:24] so-called message people
[41:27] yeah because God can't condemn me for
[41:29] being wrong because he predestinated me
[41:31] like this
[41:34] he loved me like I am
[41:37] and to prove that he loved David you
[41:40] live what David done
[41:42] come on you ain't heard the doctrines
[41:45] but yet it sounds so beautiful
[41:48] it makes that old Flagship still good he
[41:50] just he gets a shaking
[41:54] after it's all said and done you're just
[41:57] tired
[41:58] okay
[42:02] sorry about that
[42:05] okay
[42:09] let's go to number 12.
[42:17] this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[42:19] today and forever
[42:21] 1958 207 paragraph
[42:25] or e50
[42:26] gone by for ordination
[42:30] we all don't want to call
[42:32] the word predestination it's a bad word
[42:34] to use before The People
[42:37] now you remember what I was saying the
[42:39] other day the summit didn't hear it
[42:41] why is predestination a bad word to use
[42:43] for people
[42:45] it's because of what had been taught of
[42:47] predestination what people believe about
[42:49] predestination So when you say freedom
[42:51] oh yeah he's a Baptist
[42:54] I hate background of Presbyterian
[42:58] because that was two basics of
[42:59] predestinations
[43:01] all right
[43:03] so it's I've got one in here somewhere
[43:06] where he said see that predestination
[43:07] not too bad a word
[43:09] all right when you begin to understand
[43:13] well God by four knowledge can
[43:15] predestinate
[43:17] God is infinite do you believe that
[43:19] and you know everything that would be on
[43:21] the earth before he created it you
[43:23] believe that if he didn't
[43:25] he couldn't tell the end from the
[43:27] beginning
[43:27] sensible
[43:29] he knows all things therefore he could
[43:31] love Jacob and had Esau before either
[43:35] one were born
[43:37] he's not willing that any should perish
[43:39] no sir
[43:41] we buy it for knowledge let him know
[43:43] that they would perish anyhow so he
[43:46] could predestinate everything to work to
[43:50] his glory
[43:52] now
[43:54] I said while ago even you've had people
[43:56] teaching Don't Take Your Kids To Church
[43:58] back
[44:00] 100 years ago because he might get saved
[44:02] when God didn't want him to be saved
[44:06] but if I believe predestination like it
[44:08] talk the message
[44:12] I'd never go to church I'd never pray
[44:15] I'd never do nothing
[44:18] come on
[44:22] that's why I tried to tell the two Soul
[44:23] people
[44:26] I said all you trying to do is kill one
[44:28] of those Souls right yeah I said okay
[44:29] let's shoot to God that gets rid of one
[44:31] of them doesn't goes to heaven
[44:40] see if we hooked up on predestination
[44:43] if it's predetermined you can't change
[44:46] nothing
[44:50] we got into it there the other night a
[44:51] little bit about the man of aspirin 15
[44:53] years
[44:55] and God gave it to him
[44:58] how many quotes go home and run this one
[45:00] little title into your computer
[45:04] prior changes thing
[45:12] now we know that God knew he was going
[45:14] to give that man 15 years right
[45:17] come on he didn't change his mind he
[45:21] knew he was going to give it to him
[45:24] but yet the story is he gave it to him
[45:27] because he had said and you want the
[45:29] quotes from The Prophet read them unto
[45:31] that he said thus saith the Lord he said
[45:34] the prophet went up and said thus say if
[45:36] the Lord set your house nor are you
[45:37] going to die he said the same Prophet
[45:39] had to turn around and go back and say
[45:41] thus saith the Lord you're not going to
[45:42] die
[45:45] but the man died
[45:47] it's just 15 years later
[45:51] but you see God knew what he was going
[45:53] to do
[45:55] but the point is
[45:57] you don't get this point
[45:59] the point is God gave him 15 years
[46:07] what you want to argue about what he
[46:09] done to do it
[46:11] argue with it he give him 15 years
[46:18] read all of them that says that you know
[46:21] prayer changes thing and see if God
[46:23] don't link your family to you praying
[46:27] for your family
[46:29] and that changes things
[46:34] then the prophet would make a statement
[46:37] he said if you can't believe for your
[46:39] family he said I doubt you can believe
[46:41] for yourself
[46:45] you're not pulling nothing over on God
[46:48] but the point is God gave the man 15
[46:51] years you can't argue that
[46:54] you can flatter all you want to about
[46:56] what this is and that is you can't argue
[46:58] about it giving it to him
[47:00] but God before the world knew he was
[47:03] going to give that man 15 years
[47:08] but remember and I haven't got there yet
[47:11] that man was in the permissive will of
[47:13] God
[47:18] permissive will of God gave him 15 years
[47:22] perfect will of God don't give you a
[47:24] second
[47:26] write that down
[47:29] and why would you want a second if
[47:31] you're in his perfect will
[47:33] he's through with me right here today
[47:35] let me go
[47:37] I'm not worried
[47:39] why because I fulfilled my job
[47:43] all right
[47:45] look what he says now
[47:48] door to the heart number 13.
[47:50] 58 3 16.
[47:53] evening service
[47:58] that's the reason this paragrapher e84
[48:01] 58 3-16
[48:03] that's the reason when Paul spoke of it
[48:05] in Corinthians there are Romans he said
[48:09] before either child was born Esau and
[48:11] Jacob both with good holy parents I like
[48:15] that
[48:16] now get our own seed in the flesh out of
[48:19] the way both of them
[48:22] holy parents
[48:28] you see you still ain't listening to the
[48:30] whole thing or what I try to bring
[48:32] Esau was a shyster
[48:34] Jacob was a shyster
[48:39] come on
[48:47] God said I hate Esau I love Jacob
[48:52] that his election might stand true
[48:55] now God is God elect
[48:58] I've got notes at home how does he elect
[49:03] if he elects by predestination
[49:08] we don't have to worry about a thing
[49:10] right let's eat drink and be married
[49:11] cause tomorrow we die
[49:15] but if he elects by foreknowledge
[49:18] see I this is three services
[49:22] of dealing with one word for knowledge
[49:28] amen you know that for knowledge
[49:31] places you into a greater position than
[49:34] predetermining you
[49:37] come to predetermine you you would not
[49:40] have anything to do with it right
[49:46] right if it's predetermined you have
[49:48] nothing to do with it right but by
[49:50] foreknowledge
[49:51] he knew whether or not you would want it
[49:54] amen that's right now he's come back
[49:56] into our laps that foreknowledge is a
[49:58] wonderful word
[50:02] because to think that he chose me
[50:04] because I chose him
[50:07] right amen
[50:10] now did he choose me before I chose him
[50:12] come on
[50:13] predetermined
[50:19] come on come on
[50:22] if he chose before I chose him that's
[50:24] predetermined right
[50:27] see his children and him before the
[50:29] foundation world
[50:30] amen
[50:34] amen but it's because he knew I'd want
[50:37] to be saved
[50:43] and watch
[50:45] where'd we get to
[50:46] both holy parents he said hey he saw and
[50:49] loved Jacob
[50:51] it is election might stand true how many
[50:53] ever read that
[50:54] and you can't believe in elect and you
[50:57] can't believe in election he know just
[50:59] exactly what would happen certainly he's
[51:02] not willing for his foreknowledge lets
[51:04] him know
[51:06] he don't just say I'm going to save this
[51:08] and lose that one
[51:11] he wants you all saved
[51:14] but it's foreknowledge
[51:17] knowing who would so therefore he could
[51:20] predestinate according to foreknowledge
[51:23] and that's election
[51:27] to predestinate according to
[51:29] foreknowledge is election remember that
[51:31] one we'll get back to that
[51:33] in another service or two
[51:35] Jesus come and the last ones that's to
[51:37] be saved will be saved the church will
[51:39] go home
[51:41] okay I believe in that I believe in
[51:43] looking for the live seat
[51:45] amen amen
[51:46] but I believe the ones is here
[51:49] that live seed is going to be dependent
[51:51] upon you and I that have had the time to
[51:54] study the message
[51:56] the day without us won't be made perfect
[51:58] but we're fighting the heat of the day
[52:03] all right
[52:05] so what is it
[52:08] look at the next one
[52:12] want to get the baptism of the Holy
[52:14] Ghost Holy Spirit 58 9 20.
[52:17] eight morning service reading I do that
[52:19] is because people on the internet system
[52:21] might not catch this so I read that the
[52:24] uh the date of it where it'll be there
[52:27] you know all right
[52:30] and we believe that there's born-again
[52:32] Christian sainted people
[52:33] in Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[52:35] Pentecostals a lot more
[52:38] people in the message don't believe that
[52:41] ain't nobody after her
[52:44] I admit it's getting pretty shallow out
[52:46] to her but still ain't gonna argue
[52:48] because where's the last one coming from
[52:51] out there
[52:53] okay
[52:55] and he said he's born again Christians
[52:57] now you argue with him
[52:59] we believe that God's church is that
[53:02] seed
[53:04] that's mixed down through this realm
[53:06] down through here
[53:07] and it come in by what we spoke of last
[53:10] night and we'll further discuss it
[53:13] predestination
[53:15] not that God predestinates anything to
[53:18] be
[53:19] right but by his four knowledge he can
[53:21] predestinate for he knows all things
[53:25] and we found out last night
[53:28] that there's nobody ever got saved
[53:31] like tonight
[53:33] and had their name wrote on the last
[53:35] book of life
[53:36] your name was either put on a loud book
[53:38] of life before the world began or it
[53:41] never was and never will be
[53:44] if I we find out when God slayed the
[53:48] lamb before the foundation of the world
[53:50] he was slain with your lamb and you
[53:53] believe that find out just in a minute
[53:56] now
[54:00] if our names were written in the last
[54:01] book of life before the foundation of
[54:03] the world
[54:05] and we were saved before the foundation
[54:06] world what do you need to come to Earth
[54:08] to be saved for right
[54:12] simple question
[54:16] he said he even on group no I agree with
[54:17] that 100 percent
[54:20] I agree with what he's saying 100
[54:21] percent
[54:23] I agree if our names were never written
[54:25] in the last book of life before the
[54:26] foundation were it never will be written
[54:28] in there
[54:28] that's right
[54:34] but I'd ask you to remember something
[54:36] until this afternoon
[54:40] the mind of God is the Bible
[54:49] right
[54:53] I think it's Revelations 13 8 isn't it
[54:59] the lamb was slain for the foundation of
[55:01] the world
[55:02] all names were written
[55:04] that's in the Bible
[55:06] and where do we get to it this afternoon
[55:08] where brother Reynolds said God's talk
[55:10] comes down to Prophet writes it
[55:14] it becomes part of the word
[55:19] God's thought comes down
[55:22] by the prophet
[55:25] and it's written and made the Bible
[55:28] so whatever it is in the Bible is the
[55:30] mind of God that's right
[55:34] amen
[55:35] and We Know by the mind of God in the
[55:38] Bible writing that
[55:40] for knowledge comes before
[55:42] predestination
[55:47] so we're in line aren't we
[55:49] okay
[55:51] look at the next one
[55:54] 1959 12 23 questions and answers
[55:59] and wanted to know you know what is
[56:01] meant by predestination for the
[56:02] foundation the world where is it in the
[56:03] Bible and the first thing I want to say
[56:05] this
[56:07] that predestination is a bad word for
[56:10] ministers to use before an untrained
[56:12] congregation see it is I don't use it
[56:16] sometimes here at the church but out in
[56:18] the audience is out in the big where
[56:21] everything's piled in from everything
[56:25] I watched that word I always use the
[56:27] word for knowledge because
[56:29] predestination is only the foreknowledge
[56:32] of God
[56:34] is that a sensible answer yes
[56:38] yes
[56:39] God being infinite by foreknowledge he
[56:41] knew everything or he is an infinite so
[56:44] you see he knew what would happen so by
[56:47] foreknowledge he could predestinate
[56:50] foreign
[56:51] that's the reason that I believe that
[56:54] God
[56:55] no we're just going to the other you
[56:57] just keep reading all right look at the
[56:59] next one
[57:01] 1962 706 Georgia reel two
[57:06] paragraph 33 34.
[57:10] now there's a doctrine of predestination
[57:12] which is rotten
[57:15] nonsense
[57:17] so what is a predestination Doctrine
[57:20] predetermined Doctrine
[57:25] see even people who would say and
[57:28] believe
[57:29] you know the point
[57:31] would come back to Revelations and say
[57:34] well okay God wrote your name there then
[57:37] that other Feller could never have his
[57:38] name retina
[57:42] so God predetermined it
[57:46] now is that the way you believe it
[57:48] come on we read the scripture your name
[57:50] was written in the last book of life for
[57:51] the foundation world if it wasn't
[57:52] written in the last book of life for the
[57:54] foundation word of prophet said it never
[57:55] will be written there okay now watch
[57:57] your predestination doctor
[58:01] you'll see it's a garbage can
[58:05] did you say well if that name was
[58:07] written that other name was left out so
[58:09] God picked this one
[58:14] you never listened to predestination
[58:16] being preached
[58:20] well I'm glad I'm predestinated
[58:23] I was in the mind of God before the
[58:25] world you see them preachers I was in
[58:27] the mind of God we say well wait a
[58:29] minute Judas was too I don't like that
[58:31] kind of idea
[58:34] well it's truth
[58:39] because you know the Bible speaks off
[58:42] not just the Book of Life or the book
[58:45] Lounge Book of Life
[58:46] it speaks in the Book of Daniel and the
[58:49] Book of Revelation of books books plural
[58:52] being at the white Throne judgment
[58:57] and the prophet says one of those is the
[58:59] book of The Sinner
[59:00] so the book of his name's written in the
[59:02] book are you getting what I'm saying
[59:04] you say well he just you do it this way
[59:06] and you just write down names well that
[59:08] means you left out names
[59:10] God don't deal like that
[59:14] he just went ahead and made a record
[59:18] right right of Judas Esau
[59:24] Hitler's whatever you want to bring
[59:31] are you listening see what I'm trying to
[59:34] do is drive Stakes down that were that
[59:37] mind of yours when it comes up to that
[59:39] at least you're going to have to bump
[59:41] over that
[59:43] you know
[59:45] well he dealt with that
[59:48] you see what I'm talking about yes you
[59:50] say the loud Book of Life was written
[59:52] before the foundation world Amen the
[59:54] Bible says it
[59:56] well then that means you let these other
[59:58] names out no the Bible says that they
[1:00:00] were the book written
[1:00:06] now you're going to deal with what your
[1:00:07] Prophet had to say about it that's up to
[1:00:09] you in the church age book he said
[1:00:10] there'll be people the names were never
[1:00:12] written over
[1:00:15] you're gonna do what he says that's up
[1:00:17] to you
[1:00:18] but you can't argue the point of what
[1:00:20] I'm bringing
[1:00:22] it don't make a predestinated Doctrine
[1:00:24] just because you got the book of land
[1:00:26] Book of Life written before the
[1:00:27] foundation world and making him
[1:00:29] predetermined in this group and
[1:00:30] breathing determining this group to be
[1:00:32] lost because his name's not written no
[1:00:34] he makes a record of that name foreign
[1:00:40] there's books books plural
[1:00:44] written in the Bible
[1:00:46] right
[1:00:48] okay
[1:00:52] he said there's a doctor in the
[1:00:53] predestination is rotten nonsense
[1:00:56] but there really is a true
[1:00:57] predestination God by foreknowledge
[1:01:00] could predestinate because he has
[1:01:02] foreknowledge God is not willing that
[1:01:04] any should perish but being the infant
[1:01:06] of God knew who would perish and who
[1:01:08] would not that's the reason he said
[1:01:10] before
[1:01:12] Isaac are or before Jacob and Esau was
[1:01:15] born he hated he's hated Esau and loved
[1:01:18] Jacob his foreknowledge let him know
[1:01:20] that Esau was a shyster and let him know
[1:01:23] that Jacob respected that Birthright
[1:01:26] regardless of how he got it
[1:01:31] he stole it
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:37] that's what I said
[1:01:39] why don't the preachers preach the Bible
[1:01:45] Jacob stole the birthright
[1:01:49] that's nothing to do with salvation you
[1:01:51] can't steal the birthright
[1:01:54] that was only talking about property
[1:02:00] land they owned
[1:02:04] you can't steal the birthright
[1:02:06] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:11] but you see we just well Jacob just well
[1:02:14] well he was a shyster
[1:02:17] and as I said the other day we don't
[1:02:18] cover we want Esau to die and go to hell
[1:02:22] we just condemn him out he's a serpent
[1:02:24] seat Well if he did he come from
[1:02:27] okay you deal with that
[1:02:30] but just remember the end of the story
[1:02:32] when Jacob was coming back as Israel
[1:02:37] Esau met him and fell on his shoulders
[1:02:39] and were crying this your family bring
[1:02:41] them on
[1:02:43] Esau said I got a bunch of stuff
[1:02:45] Israel excuse me Israel said we got a
[1:02:48] bunch of
[1:02:50] got a bunch of stuff I'll give you
[1:02:52] I don't need it I got more than you guys
[1:02:56] we don't see the end of the story we
[1:02:58] just want to make it one way right
[1:03:00] let's say about we want to ask Abraham
[1:03:03] and Sarah in a well of water
[1:03:05] but we don't want Hagar
[1:03:08] when Hager was sitting around God come
[1:03:10] down and told her get up that water over
[1:03:12] there right same water
[1:03:17] then you can't type
[1:03:20] go when brother random gets to
[1:03:21] Masterpiece and he starts typing
[1:03:25] Hagar
[1:03:29] what Methodist am I right I believe
[1:03:31] that's right
[1:03:32] he drops it coming down
[1:03:35] see denominationalism
[1:03:37] that God used to bring you and I to the
[1:03:41] truths
[1:03:44] but that's yes that's where it gets in
[1:03:47] here on me and I know when I bring it
[1:03:48] out it looks like I'm matters on it and
[1:03:50] I am
[1:03:51] so go ahead
[1:03:53] not mad at you and me but they're dumb
[1:03:56] doctrines that we have
[1:04:00] then we won't take the word
[1:04:03] like I read that while it goes Arena
[1:04:04] read it they'll hear what's said but
[1:04:06] they won't take What's led by the
[1:04:07] prophet
[1:04:11] well I think he ought to said this okay
[1:04:14] think what you want to
[1:04:16] sign mother sign Daddy
[1:04:19] okay going to the next let me get a few
[1:04:22] more
[1:04:22] don't do an action
[1:04:30] which should be the Super sign
[1:04:32] I'm wanting to get these where you're
[1:04:33] getting this is 63 11 29 so that way
[1:04:36] you're going after the seal to see if
[1:04:38] you understand what I come up with the
[1:04:39] dates
[1:04:40] up now we're above the seals all right
[1:04:43] God note at the end from the beginning
[1:04:44] therefore he could plant everything that
[1:04:46] it would work out just to his glory and
[1:04:49] that gives us courage to know that no
[1:04:51] matter what comes or goes God is making
[1:04:53] everything the clock is ticking just
[1:04:55] exactly on time sometimes we get we're
[1:04:58] reupset we get hastily we think oh we
[1:05:01] must do this or do that but remember
[1:05:03] God's clock will will be just exactly on
[1:05:06] time all these things has to be this way
[1:05:09] it has to all be done according to his
[1:05:12] great knowledge his foreknowledge
[1:05:15] by foreknowledge he could predestinate
[1:05:17] not by his desire but by his
[1:05:20] foreknowledge God doesn't predestinate
[1:05:23] by his desire
[1:05:25] amen he desired everybody be saved he's
[1:05:30] not willing that any should perish but
[1:05:32] he knew who would and who wasn't going
[1:05:34] read another one
[1:05:36] let's get the next one
[1:05:40] what do we got 64 12 the Harvest Time
[1:05:44] all right
[1:05:45] paragraph 122 23 24. then God after
[1:05:49] adamant failed Tried by the word
[1:05:52] and fail that's how he failed Adam was
[1:05:55] Tried by the word and failed right okay
[1:05:57] God continued
[1:06:01] I want you
[1:06:03] well because before he he knew before
[1:06:05] the world what he was going to do amen
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:08] he couldn't make Adam fall right
[1:06:12] but he knew when he made him he'd fall
[1:06:15] is he dead and he's not God
[1:06:17] right
[1:06:18] come on
[1:06:20] God continued in his creation to try to
[1:06:23] find a man
[1:06:24] who would live every word
[1:06:26] now look he tried to find man that is
[1:06:29] lived the word for his age
[1:06:31] now see that put Luther in which that
[1:06:34] puts everybody in right
[1:06:36] now you see God scattered his word out
[1:06:38] because he could
[1:06:42] how could he scatter his word out
[1:06:45] he is the infinite
[1:06:47] Edie's now I'm the president amnition
[1:06:49] therefore he knows all things
[1:06:51] he can't be present everywhere you know
[1:06:53] that he's not in that way by being an
[1:06:55] omniscient you know in all claims then
[1:06:58] he can be present ever were because
[1:07:00] that's the way he predestinates Us by
[1:07:03] foreknowledge not because he desired
[1:07:06] that this person should be saved and
[1:07:09] this one lost but he knew who would be
[1:07:11] lost and who would be saved see
[1:07:12] therefore by his foreknowledge he can
[1:07:15] predestinate and he makes everything
[1:07:16] work to his glory that's what I love
[1:07:20] that's what his attributes are doing
[1:07:22] displaying to his glory
[1:07:26] one vessel of Honor and one of Dishonor
[1:07:30] um but it's God that maketh it not him
[1:07:33] that will look through him that runeth
[1:07:34] but God that showeth Mercy
[1:07:36] remember when we get back into
[1:07:40] that I said we go to foreknowledge
[1:07:45] we're going to stop this evening for
[1:07:46] knowledge is the mind of God and writing
[1:07:48] of the word
[1:07:49] well we got to make another step
[1:07:50] backwards
[1:07:52] because God never gained attributes
[1:07:54] coming this way right
[1:07:58] he always was a savior right that's
[1:08:00] right
[1:08:01] he displayed attributes on Earth
[1:08:05] he didn't become a savior just when man
[1:08:07] failed he always was the Savior amen so
[1:08:10] you got to back up a little further so
[1:08:12] you'll understand then you can go back
[1:08:13] and listen to that message I preached
[1:08:15] the other night that I was jumping
[1:08:16] backwards and forwards and backwards and
[1:08:18] forth back
[1:08:20] telling you we got to back up a little
[1:08:22] further and just cabbage down on for
[1:08:24] knowledge
[1:08:27] see we cabbage down on foreknowledge and
[1:08:28] say we got it
[1:08:30] it's just for knowledge amen
[1:08:32] but don't cabbage down on it
[1:08:35] because you're going to stop
[1:08:37] and when you stop you got troubles okay
[1:08:39] go ahead with the next let me get these
[1:08:40] next too
[1:08:43] all right this is uh
[1:08:45] when their eyes were open 64 416.
[1:08:49] they knew him paragraph 205. just like
[1:08:53] the word predestinate it's a bad word I
[1:08:55] use used it a few minutes ago when I
[1:08:58] caught myself
[1:08:59] because I felt the spirit move back many
[1:09:01] people don't believe in predestination
[1:09:03] see that would have been preached in uh
[1:09:06] Tampa Florida
[1:09:08] so he's not at the Tabernacle so we see
[1:09:10] he feels it right
[1:09:13] because he said many people don't
[1:09:14] believe in predestination predestination
[1:09:16] is a bad word
[1:09:18] for knowledge God knows before who will
[1:09:21] and they won't who won't so therefore he
[1:09:23] can predestinate by his foreknowledge
[1:09:25] that's the reason he knows who will and
[1:09:27] who won't see he don't he's not willing
[1:09:29] that any should perish but he knows who
[1:09:31] will perish if he wasn't then he wasn't
[1:09:33] God he has to be omnipotent just the
[1:09:36] same as
[1:09:37] omnipresency omniscient
[1:09:41] omnipresent omnipotent infinite
[1:09:45] he's infinite and if he isn't he isn't
[1:09:48] God so he knows all things therefore he
[1:09:51] can tell the end from the beginning
[1:09:54] because he is the word
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:01] okay let's get the last one
[1:10:06] this is trying to do God of service
[1:10:07] without his will
[1:10:09] preaching Shreveport
[1:10:11] 65 11 27 B
[1:10:16] he only reveals his word in the
[1:10:18] predestinated
[1:10:20] now when I use that word preestinate now
[1:10:23] it's a bad word to use in public
[1:10:24] especially when we have mixed crowds
[1:10:28] between the Armenians and the Calvinists
[1:10:31] see the Armenians one way the Calvinists
[1:10:33] the other way so predestination is going
[1:10:35] to be split between the Armenians and
[1:10:37] the Calvinists all right now
[1:10:40] and I I've asked you not to think
[1:10:43] I know it all but they're both wrong
[1:10:45] according to scripture Grace is what God
[1:10:48] did for you works is what
[1:10:49] I do for him see then you've got it if
[1:10:52] you climb out on either one of the limbs
[1:10:54] you'll sure find yourself out on the end
[1:10:57] of the limb and can't get back the book
[1:10:59] of Ephesians pulls it together I think
[1:11:02] now but the word when I use it
[1:11:05] predestinated don't think that I'm
[1:11:08] that's the only word I know how to to
[1:11:11] make it's God's foreknowledge see that
[1:11:14] he foreknows he can't say
[1:11:17] he he died that all might be saved
[1:11:21] he did but by his foreknowledge he
[1:11:25] knowed who would and who would not see
[1:11:27] that's what he knows I don't know and
[1:11:30] you don't know so we work out our own
[1:11:32] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:11:34] okay
[1:11:36] but you see what I'm talking about
[1:11:39] God predestinates
[1:11:42] by his foreknowledge
[1:11:44] for knowledge comes before
[1:11:46] predestination comes into existence
[1:11:49] any form of predetermining
[1:11:54] of mankind and life and World exists now
[1:11:57] I said it the way I want it
[1:11:59] for later discussion
[1:12:01] so don't come up and say you trapped it
[1:12:03] no
[1:12:04] for life world existence of mankind
[1:12:06] Earth etc etc
[1:12:09] predestination can only deal with
[1:12:12] foreknowledge
[1:12:15] and even the mind of God will only deal
[1:12:17] with foreknowledge
[1:12:19] because
[1:12:20] Jacob and Esau is both in the mind of
[1:12:22] God which is the word of God
[1:12:24] Judas is in the mind of God which is in
[1:12:26] the word of God
[1:12:28] so then thereby that we're looking at it
[1:12:30] as foreknowledge
[1:12:32] and we see that God foreknew all things
[1:12:37] then he didn't make any choices
[1:12:39] we read that and he didn't choose
[1:12:42] back Darcy he just sit and watched it
[1:12:45] unfold
[1:12:49] you you don't believe God could look at
[1:12:51] the world and to see every day and every
[1:12:52] second every minute and every person
[1:12:53] everybody to be here and just go right
[1:12:55] on that you don't believe that kind of a
[1:12:56] god
[1:13:00] well see you're in bad shape
[1:13:02] because you got a peanut brain God
[1:13:07] but if he's infinite
[1:13:10] that he could know every person would
[1:13:11] ever come into the world or whether or
[1:13:13] not they'd be saved or not
[1:13:14] so he could go ahead and write down your
[1:13:16] name in The Book of Life if you accept
[1:13:18] him as Jesus Christ here
[1:13:21] but not remember one point we'll get
[1:13:23] back to this later the Bible said that
[1:13:24] Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain
[1:13:26] before the foundation were if he hadn't
[1:13:28] come and died on a cross 2000 years ago
[1:13:30] that would have known that scripture
[1:13:34] you would cancel out your scripture
[1:13:40] so
[1:13:42] as I said the other night one more word
[1:13:46] did God see us before the world and all
[1:13:48] this unfold or is this this
[1:13:51] the fact of it unfold
[1:13:54] which one do you think
[1:13:56] what's the difference
[1:14:00] what's the difference in thinking about
[1:14:02] this is what God saw before the world or
[1:14:04] this is
[1:14:06] his mind
[1:14:11] see there's got to be this or that
[1:14:13] before the world
[1:14:14] would be false
[1:14:17] but there's got to be this
[1:14:20] you know they've got to be it's got to
[1:14:21] match that
[1:14:23] you remember years ago when I preached a
[1:14:25] message called matching pieces
[1:14:28] when Martin Luther one day walked upon
[1:14:30] upon Earth
[1:14:33] there he is
[1:14:34] I'm going to send my seed
[1:14:38] no telling how many
[1:14:39] Martin Luther preached on the just shall
[1:14:42] live by faith
[1:14:43] he was a great orator a great teacher he
[1:14:46] probably done series on those things
[1:14:50] but then one day he read it
[1:14:53] the seed came alive in the man's heart
[1:14:57] Hallelujah and he said the church shall
[1:14:59] live by faith
[1:15:01] God said yep got a lot of problems he
[1:15:03] makes the Jews he's still a trinitarian
[1:15:07] he wants to stay in the Catholic Church
[1:15:09] I'm ready
[1:15:12] story of his life so
[1:15:14] you know
[1:15:15] he didn't want to leave the Catholic
[1:15:17] church he wanted to convert to church
[1:15:18] they run him out he's a reformer he
[1:15:22] wanted to reform him
[1:15:25] would you see God saw that
[1:15:27] and he said there it is
[1:15:30] now I can move on the scene and start
[1:15:33] the great restoration
[1:15:37] to fulfill Joy
[1:15:40] I can start now
[1:15:42] I've got a seat on Earth
[1:15:48] let's stand
[1:15:51] come on brother musicians
[1:15:55] take on these things
[1:16:00] see we think about well what will be
[1:16:03] will be
[1:16:06] not to leave a lot out right we said
[1:16:09] well what will be what will be you know
[1:16:13] well just forget it then if it's what
[1:16:15] will be will be
[1:16:18] but if you're not getting anything about
[1:16:20] foreknowledge I hope you get one time
[1:16:23] I'm glad it's by foreknowledge
[1:16:26] because that gives me
[1:16:30] a link or whatever you want to call it
[1:16:33] to my salvation
[1:16:36] that he saw I would want it
[1:16:39] and he would have it ready
[1:16:43] and had them in the garden
[1:16:45] wasn't running around hunting God either
[1:16:48] God was hunting at him
[1:16:51] but he knew what it would take to catch
[1:16:53] old Adam's ruins
[1:16:56] he knew what it would do to cross Saul's
[1:16:59] path
[1:17:00] you need to be changed to Paul
[1:17:03] see God cannot override your free moral
[1:17:06] agency and save you if you do not want
[1:17:09] to be saved
[1:17:10] so then when we say salvation's of the
[1:17:13] Lord amen because he paid the price but
[1:17:16] you and I must accept it or the pardon
[1:17:20] is not a pardon
[1:17:22] unless we accept it
[1:17:27] now no problem then on foreign
[1:17:31] those who before knew he did
[1:17:32] predestinate those who he foresaw
[1:17:37] and all those words into the computer
[1:17:39] and see what the prophet has to say
[1:17:41] I'm trying to cut down not lay this
[1:17:43] thing out to make it long
[1:17:47] it's running these words for nowadays
[1:17:49] predestination
[1:17:51] you better be ready to read a long time
[1:17:54] because they're like 500 times before
[1:17:56] knowledge
[1:18:04] what church
[1:18:06] do we really believe it
[1:18:09] God's foreknowledge knew exactly who'd
[1:18:11] be sitting in this church today
[1:18:14] we didn't pull nothing over on him he
[1:18:16] knew exactly but you know what you had
[1:18:19] to get up and get red income
[1:18:22] so why not say Amen
[1:18:28] I'm beginning to feeling pretty good
[1:18:30] about me
[1:18:32] I do have a little bit to do with this
[1:18:37] go ahead brother that's 204 inspirable
