========================================

oh Lord y'all remember to clean floor today okay we'll leave that alone we won't even worry about that today how about that Bob picture is Ting all right you do you brother that's right what you today we're starting on the second seal all right and uh well we kind of reviewed it last week but let's read chapter 6 verse 1 through 2 is what the first seal verse three and 4 is the second seal so the feel like a miss and something I guess it's that thing um that's on so the horse rider the man yeah I don't we're not turning it on we're not going to use it it we take 5 minutes for it to boot back up the horse rider gets off of this horse all right same person but what he's going to do he's going to change his power his horse horse is a power that's not a physical horse right horse is a power all right so he's going to get off of that first Power why because he started that power and that power continues M which was a what a saying in the people's mind a saying that went out that Jesus was a light substance of God not these sub of God basically same old Doctrine that's in the message today and like brother Dale said last last week or Wednesday night if you don't think so ask somebody of some of the major people that that preach it yeah they believe that he was just a man walked just like me and you walked around that's why I can't understand this is what I don't understand this is what's so silly they say that you and I and I say they some of the big people in the message say that you and I will come here with eternal life in our soul right that's a major doctrine that you know you come here with eternal life in your soul but Jesus did yeah doesn't make sense I can't put one in one don't make two on that one one in one makes about five or six or something see that's an error that's an error that was a saying right become a deed and then it become a Doctrine cuz once you preach something it's a Doctrine and that power goes into the people cuz remember the devil's nothing without me and you giving him some power we give him the power to do the things he does but yeah that always stunned me that that they preach so hard that you and I were born with eternal life but Jesus was born just a man and received eternal life on the River Jordan I think they got it backwards somewhere you knowly and you say well I got these quotes I was telling y'all the other night the essence of the message doesn't say that the essence the the essence of the Bible and the message coming together shows you that the Bible says he was born Emmanuel God With Us he wasn't born the second person of a trinity in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodly see so you see other people they take so well he's like the the guy did about him being a third of God that he wasn't the fullness well see he's denying scripture that horse that Rider has been so instilled we we went last night to a concert and and U into a Baptist Church and those people are really sincere I mean they're really sincere they were raising their hands and praising God but uh scripturally they they're they're wrong so so what do you do you do the best you can yes the life in front of them do the best you can but what they're deceived that horse rider got on them denominational horses and rode and has not quit riding right uh we're going to tie this in with the Book of James James says when lust is conceived bre for sin When sin is finished brings forth death okay so that's the same way with these four horse riders when you begin the second the third and the fourth all right so we're going to bring tting together with the book of James is showing that the horse riders are all a deception there is nothing truth in that man getting on the horse except about 99% well that kind of shocked you didn't it and only ones at the end time is soose so close remember so close he's not 99% wrong or he would have a horse to ride on this is my point he wouldn't have a horse to ride if he Satan's not that he's dumb but he's not that dumb okay okay he he he's got to get it so close to it looks the same right right that's the deception the deception is not that that he's in the world and you know the smoking the drinking the cussing the running around and all that stuff that's the world that's right that's that's the that's the devil's he's already got them so he's working on what he's working on the religious people see that's who he works through that's right I hate to say that but he works through religious people and he can to a degree work through Christians right hello right he can work through Christians and I'm not doing that for my ear my ear itches okay but he does so this is why these horse riders were so deceiving yet we got to see underneath all that though that God's working first he always works first all right he always works first you got to remember that you say well this person doing this that's fine that's symbols That's what Satan is doing through a group of people but underneath there there's a group of people that gets a revelation of the first seal which is the line bold line of the tribe of Judah justification in one true and living God all right that's what Satan don't want you to say listen if he can get you to doubt your experience this is this is this is this has been something that I've been studying for a little while because we go back and we and it's hard to do because we're human we go back and we say God I am so sorry for what I did 20 years ago right and God's up there going what are you talking about yeah I mean honestly if he puts your sins now go back to the Bible the Bible's lying if God doesn't put that in the sea of forgetfulness never he can he that's one thing God can do he can never remember that again that's right but you and I what and the rer brings it back up and then I like that song what SS are you talking about you're sitting there going Lord I did this I did that forget that sure it's going to come back to your memory sure you going but just say Lord thank you for bringing me from one place to another place that old man that did that is dead right not divorced if you if he's divorced then you got a problem you you keep bringing it back up and if it's not if it's not dead that's why that I you know I love marriage and divorce pretty straight you know if your husband's not dead or your wife's not dead you can't marri again right why would you want you know that's like the denominational World think they're married to God I hate to say that but it's what the prophet said but they married the devil like brother Dell said you can say Jesus Jesus and be calling on the devil right I mean that's truth that's right that's how the deception is that's why we had to have a Prophet come in the end time to pull that thing apart so we could see because we were so close to it it was so ingrained in our in our psyche it was so what preached to us right indoctrinated us but now we're going to see that that this first part under justification that's done away with but we're going to see the second seal we're going to talk about a blood that not just cover sin we're going to talk about a blood that eradicates sin and the real you didn't do it that's what we have to see to get to take a body change you really going to have to say it right cuz what hurts us condemnation right right well I thought Romans 8 said there's therefore now Paul said 2000 years ago there's therefore now no condemnation but you know what that's got to be a revelation that's right right it's not not been revealed to us 100% that one scripture that's right MH there is therefore now Paul was bringing you know if he didn't say well if he just said well if there's there's therefore no condemnation he said there's therefore now now once you're in Christ Jesus there should be known you say oh I get condemned every day that's fine but who does the condemning it's not God condemning you that's right right it's your past and the things that you do in the human that we live in and we do have to repent every day but you don't have to repent for what you did 20 years ago if you really truly repented and you're born again that's the problem if you're not really born again those sins are just heaping right back on you again that's true right that's the difference in the justification that we're talking about in the seals that that the that it's as if you never done it then we're heading toward the real you didn't never do it right you going to have to see right here that that that that it that you know you did it but you know you're redeemed right in this part of you're going to have to see that that real you didn't do it right that's true that's why I can't understand the people in the message that preach that we are we had eternal life in our soul the things I did in my previous like like they always say BC before Christ all right before Christ the things I did there was no way the Holy Ghost resided in my my soul that's right no way that's right cuz God won't dwell in an unclean vessel he will not that's right right he will not dwell in an unclean vessel so not dwelling in an unclean vessel but what is redemption is taking that man that fell that soul that fell because of Adam and Eve transgression we were born in sin shaper in iniquity that person that fell now can be picked back up to what the level that God did see you before the foundation of world and I believe with all my heart that if you're a born again Christian today that God give you a special Angel when you were born to lead you and guide you cuz what he knew the end from the beginning so he knew where he was going to meet you at and he knew that you were going to come to this place and so he had it there where was it at it's in here you must be born from above well this word didn't come from man down here on the ground that's right this came from God Almighty from heaven above so this is where you born from amen so same way with the seals we we I have to scratch my head because sometimes you explaining things you make people think I don't want us to think we got greasy Grace going on but there is come to a point to where you got to stand just like Jesus did and said I am my father one who can condemn me of sin now he was born of he was so much man though to they thought thought he was number one that thought I was looking at it the other day cuz I'm reading Matthew Mark Luke and John like brother Dale said read all right and you look in there you know what I read Mark the other morning and it was that I had never read the book of Mark before the chapter of Mark I got to read nothing I'm like man this a new Bible Well you know it becomes one when you enter into a different realm you start reading it different cuz it it does start out Matthew I mean Mark starts out Jesus Christ the son of God we see that that's the Revelation that you're supposed to get the church is built on the Son of God Revelation but you and I have been commissioned to be like the astronaut get up off of the earth and get into the realm of the son of man which is God in human flesh that's the part they really miss with the God standing there they said he was a wine bibber well guess what Jesus must have drank a lot of wine now they don't get drunk over there like we you know you we drink a couple of wine and we fall over silly it's like Germans Germans drink beer like we drink tea so they drink a case of beer and it's like us drinking three gallons of tea so you see your body but see they saw him so much with with publicans Sinners you know what a Publican is you ever looked that word up my heaven people we say it all the time tax collector oh okay they hated them people yeah that's right they hat and they would go to the house like the IRS that we have now they would go to the house to collect taxes that's why they hate them that's why the publicans and siners were pushed over to the side nobody liked them they weren't they weren't lawmakers and like we say well they were the no they were just Tax Collectors they were told by the government that Bob owed you know taxes and they would go try to collect those taxes nobody liked them so they were over to the side with the cers yep Matthew was a Publican Matthew was a tax collector yes he was and um and I'm sure they were shocked when he changed his life around some but still I mean if you're a tax collector you're a tax collector but they were all pushed to one side and Jesus was sitting there ministering to them leaving the socalled religious world alone except for to condemn them every time he go in the temple you finished share but you that's why I'm up here I'm up here to talk you got come chair now yeah I just talking about the Republicans Republican not the Republican no one of the reasons they were hated so much is because they were they done everything they were not honest in what they doing they just didn't collect taxes they ripped people off and they became Rich that's correct because what they collected was what they paid the Govern and then they and Jesus was around that I mean so you see that how they how they pre what he say preconceived idea of who Jesus was supposed to be he wasn't remember they said cus oh he you know the Messiah come right up to cus and say oh great cus no he came up and told cus who he was and where he come from but what I'm saying is is back to the point the point is you and I are going to have to have to go to if we if we know that that man that walked on the shores of Galilee was God Almighty in human flesh the Holy Ghost That was in him that was not just in him was a part of him right right that's right comes back into the believer at the new birth then like I told you before many many many many many many years ago you read the things that I do shall you do also but we got to start believing that right that's right the things I do what did he do he got up every morning he didn't have to say he was God he knew he was God he knew that he had a purpose now sure the outside man had a purpose for death right brother Dale covered that real good cuz you got to step to he was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world Lamb of God is the only thing that can bleed that's right the Son of God can't bleed the Son of God can't die same way with you you can bleed but you can't die if you're born again right you can't die so you've got that part right what we got to do is start working on the outside part and that's what these seals are is to show us number one the opposition what punch he has what punch he's got coming and to be ready when he brings that punish and you say you just do like Jesus what Jesus do Jesus didn't destroy the Devil and he didn't destroy he said the word says scripture says it is written that's why just it just came to me that's why he got to be son of man again because he had to be flesh to be able to die that's right that's why we that's why that in Matthew 17 he said tell the vision of the one until the son of man be risen again son of man died 2,000 years ago he rose the Son of God ascended and was a Son of God through seven Church ages all right but for a moment it's like brother Dale said and i' had never seen that before that's why I that's why I keep coming back Serv sometimes it's the only reason no really you ought to come here just to listen to what what the Lord says through our pastor that's right but when he said and he brought that in that that he had to die son of man right then that was that was the whole purpose of that sacrifice was to take away the old sacrifice of the blood of bulls and goats because the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin Satan can't take away sin their sin could only be covered that's right is or cap of what they covered sin can only be covered so it was still there right right right but when Christ come his blood had life in it that could come back in me and you right that's right the the blood of that's why the that's why the um animals I don't know why I'm going this way but I'm going this way anyway that's why the blood of the animal had no soul right in it so that the blood the life that was in that animal couldn't come back into the believer Jesus had to become the son of man to bleed and die to give us life right that was already in him to release that life to bring it back into you and I right so that's why it's the Son of God first revelation is the Son of God God indwelling your soul and you're born again Christian but now it says television no one till son of man be risen again well they killed him 2,000 years ago but what's happened now spiritually though through these ages and through these riters they killed him again they didn't kill him they killed the effect what they done is they buried him M they buried the Revelation yes mhm amen they buried that Revelation during the church ages and now like brother Dale said I'll get back to my point now where brother Dale said there's no promise of the Son of God coming back there is no promise there's no promise of a Son of God coming back it never left right sure only I mean he was here 3040 days okay as the son of man and Son of God all power in heaven and earth been given unto me when he ascended just a few days later right and come to the day of Pentecost 50 only 10 or 11 days after his Ascension he comes back in the Holy Ghost okay right so the Son of God really never left the place right right the son of man's the one that left and the son of man's the one's got to come back because it's it's required in the scripture as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there is no uh the Son of God who doesn't have to come it never left the revelation of the Son of God never left the Earth never it's been on Earth Listen Hold on what that's the new birth stand for that's correct but you got to remember the Son of God wasn't 2,000 years ago right the Son of God was a Creator God right way back before time so he's all been way back before we think let he come on earth right no he was the son of God he he was the son of God when he walked in front of of and I mean Adam and Eve that's what brother Brown said he said that was the Loos that created everything was the son of God so the Son of God Revelation is back into eternity and it really never changes it just keeps going cuz remember it's God above ush sure he dropped down in time to be God With Us is Jesus he come back though he just went up just for a little while come straight back down and it's been Son of God down through seven Church ages but to take a body change and to fulfill scripture the son of man has to come back to the Earth but he can't come back because look he's barred by scripture his feet can't hit the earth until the millennial reign as the son of David to the Jews is that all right okay and who's who's got to bring him back he's got a horse to ride remember Revelations 19 it shows him coming back on a what white horse and many followed behind him and I don't think they were walking or riding on birds I think they were riding their White Horse amen amen right that's why I don't like that statement somebody say get off your high horse or there your white horse or all that stuff you crazy but when he opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse so it's a different horse it's not the same hor different horse right that was read and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth so what's it going to be it's going to be some kind of some kind of something that's going to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another does Satan actually kill you Satan listen Satan cannot come down as a physical being and kill you that's right God can that's right that's right All Souls are mind he can bring it he can take it out amen but Satan can't do that what he gets into you enough and you do it come on do you think you die in human flesh and God did that no God's not God has no death in him at all how do you think to people's judgment what's he going to do to people's judgment I said you should he's going to stand up there in judgment he's going to have the word of God and all the bride behind him and they're going to condemn their self they're going to know that they did wrong right amen amen the devil made me do it no I I'm like Daddy I I agree 100% most of the time I'm the one that does it now he may suggest it that's right but I'm the one that does it cuz remember Satan has no power how can he how can he be a force to reckon with when the Bible says he's going to be like a drunk on the side of the road how can be a force to reckon with when we're all walking in the Millennium and he's still alive and you're not he's not going to be down there in a chain like you know the Bible say he'd be chained up in the bottomless pit he ain't going to be chained up you know what he's going to be he's going to be a man standing with no power yes he's just going to have to stand still because you know what he tried to go out and do something it's going to be cut off see that's what happened in the garden cuz remember Satan and God both was in the Garden of Eden it wasn't just God and then the devil came on down somewhere no they were together the whole time Satan finally figured out a way to get into the human race right he knew that creation was Creative Evolution not Evolution Creative Evolution and that whatever that Beast was he could either flop over to the man's side or back to the animal side and he said there's where I can get in and he what he went right for it right but remember he had to use somebody to do it he couldn't create somebody to do it that's right he had to use a beast that had no soul you'll get that in the little B do like my cousin Terry Dale said he told a joke last night nobody laughed he said you'll get that when you go home so anyway there went out another horse that was red now what does red signify blood uh what does red signify something killed kill they should kill one another s that's I said when when people go to war the devil doesn't kill people people kill people that's right but the motivation of the devil that's right is that they're in opposition with each other and they're going to kill each other okay so and I think what's going to happen is if you'll see these at least the four with the four be standing here you're going to see that Satan really has no power he motivates you to do his work right you say well God does the same thing I differ with you and the point that brother brandham says when God enters you that's God's hand there's a big difference there but it's really only about that th because Satan does the same thing if he he if he enters if he enters into a person and and uses them as Satan's hand but if God enters in and uses you that's God's hand but Satan the only problem with Satan is he cannot ever use it for good it can look good for a while but he never can carry it all the way out right there's a lot of good people in this world that's right but if they're not born again they're going to hell that's just the bottom line that's right are are be given eternal life you understand what I'm saying but they cannot be God in human flesh on the earth unless you're born again through justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost that's not a law that's what's written in the that's true right so the horse is red we saw too that it was I need to put red up here just kind of keep your little bullet points red and red signifies blood all right and we're going to also see as this develops we're going to go up a little early cuz the kids are going to have a program what is what is the blood of God what does it do it didn't it didn't cover sin it took it away put in the sea of God's forgiveness never to be remembered again that's right that's sanctification sanctification is readed all right so we're going to we're going to go through this justification sanctification those who is Justified he's already glorified white what you start becoming white in justification right and you know what if you say God forgive me of my sins and you die in his eyes you are white you going to be given eternal life right I you white robes were given I like that but I want to mine down here you know I want mine down here that way I'm safe when I go anywhere else right I don't want have to go somewhere to get a white robe because what the Bible says the white robe is what the righteousness of the Saints are we going to just wait till we get righteous that's what the people in the denominational World well one day we going to get a new body and we going to be good no you better be good here right you better do what the Bible says here you ain't going to be no there to you all right that's why you see these seals we're talking about simple salvation brother R said don't ever leave that same simple message of Salvation even in the apex of the message of the hour or what God's brought the son of man Ministry what did he come to do he tells you if you going if you read Matthew Mark Luke and John you hear he said he come to what seek and save those who were lost this one bottom line yeah right then all these other benefits see we can tack on to it because we're at the end time when the son of man is rising again or has risen again into the hearts of people and then then you are God made manifest in another form on the earth called a bride right cuz all the other ones have dead they died went on right and they went out another horse that was red and power was given him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another who's they the people on the Earth all right this is a literal seal this is when this we went through the first three ages Ty the first seal right MH all right the next Church age is the tharan church age this is the longest age and it's called the Catholic age because the Catholics killed 68 million Protestants protesting that's why they call it protesting yes protesting the Roman Catholic Church 68 million in their own books read Fox's Book of Mark if you can get through it I couldn't so I just quit reading it what they did to people in the name of religion and that Demon's not dead he's right still back here now right cuz you know like brother R said he said you know Thou shalt not kill well you don't have to physically kill somebody to be committing to be committing murder right belittling someone doing you're you're killing their influence you kill the person right that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword all right so in other words now he has a word he has an indoctrination and you know you say well it's Catholic Church well the Catholic church is the beginning of it all but Baptist Methodist Pentecostals and all that in the same boat right organizational religion is in the same boat all right he was given a great sword not just a sword he's given a great sword why because everything's going to be real close and so close now till it would deceive the very elect if it were possible right right all right so now let's go to Matthew 20 and let's tell you what I'm going to read it out of here you can read it on on the thing I'm going to read it here cuz I think I got a comment or two in my in my this one the battery never runs out of it so I like that too yeah the batter you don't have to mash never have to reset it either this thing right here you have to reset every once in a while this one now you don't have to reset that all right can't find Matthew in Revelation brother Brown said that the other day I was listen or reading a book somewhere he said well I can't find Corinthians in Colossians he was in Corinthian oh he made a mistake all right now for many shall come in my name and shall deceive many got that that was the first seal right that was the first seal a deceiver second seal is this and you shall hear of Wars wars and rumors what does the war do kill there's never been a war fought even between a husband and a wife that they weren in a little blood shed somewhere I'll get you to wake up cuz some of you off into the Land of Nod remember C's the only one that went to nod first all right but you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars what kill let me tell you let me do this right here let me bring Revelation back will it was so neat how the how the Lord showed brother random how these seals compared with Matthew 24 all right horse was red and power was given in selling to take what take peace from the earth if there's peace there's peace if there's war there's no peace right peace from and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword second seal and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled you see the Waring in the message and the Waring around the world physically and spiritually be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but but the end is not yet okay this is not the war to end all wars right there will come a time of a war that'll end all wars and I'm talking about spiritual and physical but there is a time when this War's got to be over right what's we Waring at in our flesh in our members in our in our spiritual realm right that's the war that we fight now the next one coming down is the third seal all right so we won't read it here in Matthew 24 for it says for Nations shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and I wrote Satan and God so it's both kingom there's only two kingdoms in the world there's not a Grecian and a and a Roman and a there's only two kingdoms right Satan's kingdom and God's kingdom that's only two there's no gray area so you know you you either fighting for one and against the other or for this one and against this one you're always at War it's like Paul said I mean like U yeah Paul it said I have a Waring in my members what the things I would not I do the things I do I would not right that's iniquity you know better than to do it and you do it anyway and we do it all the time but there's an advocate that we've got to look back to and not see that he has crawled on the cross and throw his blood out again he died once for all the Bible says one time for every sin on the face of this Earth he died one time and he does not have to die again that's right now man has killed him his influence man has buried that son of man Revelation but it was Satan riding through the men to do it and women yeah right right but the Catholic Church killed 68 million Protestants that's why you call it Protestants protesters the only problem is is now the Protestants have become the the um the horse daughter and given power cuz the only thing look the only doctrine that Catholics and and and Protestants really have is like brother R said the the U communion okay communion Ro um Catholic Church says that when you give the I mean it's kind of silly but look what they've done they've indoctrinated that when you take that wafer and put it in your mouth now remember you don't get to drink the wine that's right the priest drinks wine that's why they're all drunks I mean honestly why they do the things they do but they put it in their mouth and that turns into the Flesh of God now that's what they teach yeah and that he drinks the wine symbolizing the blood keep him clean so he can keep you clean well that's not true at all but you look at the denominational World they they taken uh it's just a piece of cracker and there's no symbolism at all so you're going to see how the two's going to come together they'll compromise on that and then they'll all become one but we got to see these seals and get out of here because once that starts boiling that's when me and you are going to be persecuted that's when me and you are going to be stopped from doing things that we can do now we're free country to do what we want to thank God for Thanksgiving yes but there's a great Thanksgiving feast that we're going to and it ain't going to be in this Dimension but we got to get there first so let's go remember Tuesday night we have church
