[6:17] you when the morning stars sing together
[6:19] and the sons of god shout out for joy
[6:21] that's right so each time we have um
[6:24] this opportunity to me it's it's like a

[8:05] the grace
[8:16] is
[8:40] is
[8:57] i
[9:05] just
[9:06] can't
[9:20] beside me
[9:49] intentions i've had
[9:53] sometimes my stream just
[10:09] says
[10:18] is
[10:35] is
[10:47] i'm
[11:09] oh my god
[11:17] me
[11:49] through
[11:56] going back
[12:16] amen but we're not going by feeling this
[12:19] morning
[12:20] one by faith
[12:22] in the promise
[12:23] faith in his word
[12:25] faith in
[12:26] faith in a faithful god
[12:29] who is faithful he that has to be done
[12:31] in good work
[12:33] perform it until the day of jesus christ
[12:35] amen
[12:36] and um
[12:38] we used to sing a little song when i was
[12:40] growing up
[12:44] i know whom i have believed
[12:46] and then persuaded
[12:48] he is able to keep that which i have
[12:51] committed
[12:52] unto him against that day amen
[12:56] let's stand this morning
[12:58] and
[12:59] turn with me in your bibles
[13:02] to psalm chapter 61
[13:05] and while you're turning around
[13:06] i do
[13:08] counted a tremendous honor and privilege
[13:10] to have this opportunity
[13:13] to speak to you this morning
[13:15] and i appreciate brother samuel by the
[13:18] way
[13:19] um
[13:20] the ministry that that is here the
[13:22] government of this church
[13:24] and each of you who make up this portion
[13:26] of the body of the bride of jesus christ
[13:29] um
[13:30] never take things for granted
[13:33] and if i stood here this morning for one
[13:35] moment relying on my own ability or my
[13:38] own understanding or
[13:40] learning i i would step down from this
[13:42] pulpit right now
[13:44] and turn it over someone else because i
[13:46] that would be the most dangerous thing
[13:49] that i would ever do to you or myself
[13:52] i ask you to hold me in your prayers
[13:54] this morning that the lord would speak
[13:56] that he would move
[13:58] brother tim aside and just use
[14:00] a vessel that
[14:02] i've tried to consecrate to him for his
[14:04] service amen
[14:06] um
[14:08] we
[14:09] remember brother samuel in prayer this
[14:11] morning that's right and uh sister dale
[14:14] lord of bless them and touch them and
[14:16] also i bring you greetings this morning
[14:18] from my pastor brother joel hughes
[14:21] and all of the believers there the
[14:22] saints that make up that portion
[14:25] of the body of jesus christ and uh
[14:27] from grace coveted tabernacle amen
[14:30] let's read this morning in psalm 61
[14:34] you pray for my voice
[14:36] also the lord will just give us strength
[14:39] let's read beginning at verse 1
[14:41] down through verse 8.
[14:45] hear my cry o god
[14:48] attend unto my prayer
[14:51] from the end of the earth
[14:53] will i cry unto thee
[14:55] when my heart is overwhelmed
[14:58] lead me
[15:00] to the rock
[15:02] that is higher than i
[15:05] for thou has been a shelter for me
[15:08] and a strong tower from the enemy
[15:12] i will abide in thy tabernacle forever
[15:17] i will trust
[15:19] in the covert of thy wings
[15:24] for thou o god
[15:26] hast heard my vows
[15:29] thou has given me
[15:31] the heritage of those
[15:33] that fear thy name that's right
[15:35] thou wilt prolong the king's life
[15:38] and his years as many generations
[15:43] he shall abide before god forever
[15:45] oh prepare mercy and truth
[15:49] which may preserve him
[15:51] so will i sing praise unto thy name
[15:54] forever
[15:55] that i may daily perform my vows
[15:58] i mean let's go to the author of the
[16:00] word in prayer this morning if you have
[16:04] a need in your life
[16:06] a burden upon your heart something you
[16:10] desire from the lord
[16:12] this morning
[16:15] hold that there as we approach
[16:18] him in prayer this morning lord jesus
[16:21] we come humbly
[16:23] before that throne of mercy and grace
[16:25] this morning
[16:28] and we come
[16:29] boldly father
[16:33] as queen esther
[16:35] lord could approach the king
[16:39] realizing it was life or death but at
[16:41] the same time believing father there was
[16:44] a relationship there
[16:45] there was a bond
[16:48] that you
[16:49] would extend favor
[16:51] lord as your bride this morning we
[16:53] believe that you are conscious
[16:56] of the needs of every soul present
[16:59] in this building this morning
[17:01] and even those fathers who are not here
[17:05] perhaps lord in a in a natural body that
[17:08] we could see or touch
[17:10] feel or hear but lord in spirit they're
[17:13] here this morning because their desire
[17:16] is to be here but their body wasn't able
[17:19] and we're burdened for them this morning
[17:20] lord and we lift them up before you in
[17:22] prayer
[17:23] i don't know each name but you know each
[17:26] one lord god
[17:27] who lord the enemy may have hindered
[17:30] this morning through sickness or
[17:31] affliction
[17:32] weakness lord or
[17:34] just being at a low place perhaps father
[17:36] along their christian journey but we ask
[17:39] you lord
[17:40] that the
[17:41] holy spirit will go and minister
[17:44] healing lord and strength edify thy body
[17:48] lord which is still here upon this earth
[17:51] and pray lord our prayer this morning is
[17:53] that you will come and speak in this
[17:56] service lord
[17:58] and minister to each need that's present
[18:00] lord
[18:01] and move me aside father and have thy
[18:04] perfect will and way
[18:06] we ask that you'll grant it lord in
[18:08] jesus name we pray amen amen amen you
[18:12] may be seated
[18:22] i want to
[18:25] speak this morning
[18:27] on a subject
[18:28] or
[18:29] the title of this message
[18:32] i would title our heritage
[18:34] and i take this from verse 5
[18:37] of psalm 61
[18:41] in the
[18:42] second portion of that verse
[18:45] the psalmist david
[18:48] says thou hast given me
[18:50] the heritage
[18:52] of those that hear thy name
[18:56] and when i read this verse of scripture
[18:59] it seemed like inspiration came to me
[19:02] and so i want to look at that this
[19:05] morning our heritage
[19:07] and what was david seeing
[19:10] that inspired him
[19:12] god moved upon his heart to write this
[19:14] verse
[19:15] in the holy writ in the scripture
[19:19] and how perhaps you and i could also see
[19:23] what david saw
[19:24] and draw
[19:26] strength from that amen right
[19:29] turn with me this morning also to the
[19:31] book of colossians
[19:34] i'd like to read colossians chapter one
[19:38] and verses 9 through 14.
[19:53] just to get a little foundation this
[19:54] morning
[19:56] paul says here as he addresses the
[20:00] colossians he says in verse 9
[20:04] for this cause we also since the day we
[20:06] heard it
[20:08] do not cease to pray for you and to
[20:10] desire that he might be filled
[20:12] with the knowledge of his will
[20:15] in all wisdom
[20:17] and spiritual understanding
[20:19] that he might walk
[20:21] worthy of the lord
[20:23] unto all pleasing
[20:25] being fruitful in every good work
[20:28] and increasing in the knowledge of god
[20:31] right
[20:32] there's a big there's a vast difference
[20:35] between the knowledge of god
[20:37] and the knowledge that comes from the
[20:39] tree of knowledge of good and evil which
[20:41] is imparted by lucifer that's right but
[20:44] paul is dealing with the knowledge of
[20:45] god in verse 11 he continues
[20:48] strengthened with almighty
[20:50] according to his glorious power
[20:52] unto all patience and long-suffering
[20:54] with joyfulness
[20:56] giving thanks unto the father
[20:58] which hath made us meet
[21:01] to be partakers
[21:03] of the inheritance
[21:05] of the saints in life amen there's a
[21:08] there's a a a great similarity between
[21:11] an inheritance and a heritage
[21:14] david speaks of a heritage paul speaks
[21:16] of
[21:17] an inheritance
[21:19] and he says in verse 13 who hath
[21:21] delivered us
[21:23] from the power of darkness
[21:25] and
[21:26] speaking in
[21:28] present tense
[21:30] terms
[21:31] and hath translated us
[21:34] into the kingdom of his dear son right
[21:37] there is a transition that paul is
[21:39] describing or our translation
[21:42] paul is describing here in verse 13 that
[21:45] i believe applies to each and every son
[21:47] and daughter of god yes sir amen from
[21:49] the power of darkness
[21:52] into the kingdom of his dear son
[21:56] in whom verse 14 we have redemption
[21:59] through his blood even the forgiveness
[22:02] of sins that's right amen amen
[22:05] now
[22:06] i always like to begin
[22:09] this thought by sharing a story from my
[22:11] teenage years and i might have shared it
[22:13] here before
[22:15] but i was about 14 years old or so
[22:18] and one day
[22:20] i believe it was on maybe a friday or
[22:22] saturday probably a friday because
[22:25] um my dad was a mail carrier and his
[22:28] days off he was always off on sunday and
[22:31] then his days off through the week
[22:32] rotated monday tuesday wednesday
[22:35] thursday and then when he got to friday
[22:37] he would get friday and saturday and
[22:38] sunday was a long weekend
[22:40] next week he'd work all six days but
[22:43] we were going down my dad my granddad
[22:46] myself being the oldest of uh
[22:50] my dad's first three boys
[22:51] all three of us boys are in the back
[22:53] seat of the car we're driving down to
[22:55] the coast to go fishing
[22:56] you know um
[22:58] believers don't go to the beach they go
[23:00] to the coast
[23:03] you gotta be careful now to use these
[23:05] terms
[23:06] so we're driving to the coast to go
[23:09] fishing
[23:10] and um
[23:12] my granddaddy who is now going on
[23:15] passed on my dad's father would begin to
[23:19] tell us a story about a time years years
[23:22] ago
[23:22] they had a family reunion and
[23:25] granddaddy and my dad's side of the
[23:27] family was from the eastern part of
[23:29] north carolina down around the
[23:30] wilmington and elizabethton area
[23:33] and so at this family reunion uh
[23:37] one of my uncles or one of my dad's
[23:39] uncles or one of my granddad's uncles
[23:41] was there
[23:42] and his name was john
[23:45] and he was bound to a wheelchair
[23:47] and i
[23:48] i would guess he was up in years and you
[23:51] know just there and and seated in the
[23:53] wheelchair and you know how it is a
[23:55] defending reunion all sitting around
[23:56] maybe in the living room just
[23:58] reminiscing sharing stories and
[24:01] someone noticed that um that john uncle
[24:05] john was crying and he had tears coming
[24:08] out of his eyes and streaming down his
[24:10] face and
[24:12] so you know how it is sometimes when a
[24:14] person is maybe in pain or something
[24:16] they can't i'll can't always say it so
[24:20] they saw this
[24:22] song in crying and so i i suppose it was
[24:25] one of my answer
[24:26] uh because someone spoke to him said
[24:28] john
[24:29] said is everything okay
[24:32] everything's fine are you hurting or
[24:35] anything need anything to know
[24:38] and uh the way my granddaddy
[24:40] tells the told the story was that
[24:42] someone else spoke up and said oh that's
[24:43] just that's just crosses
[24:47] said when when a cross is happy they cry
[24:50] that's that's one way they express
[24:53] their joy and and
[24:54] so um
[24:56] said he's there's nothing wrong with him
[24:58] he's just he's just a cross and that's
[25:00] what crosses do when they get happy is
[25:02] they cry
[25:03] and so
[25:05] granddaddy went on and told whatever
[25:07] well that
[25:09] that story that my granddaddy told stuck
[25:11] with me
[25:13] because it helped me to understand
[25:15] something about myself right i'm a cross
[25:18] right
[25:19] i would be three or four generations
[25:22] perhaps from this uncle right
[25:24] but
[25:25] it runs in my genes
[25:27] it runs in my the dna that i inherit
[25:30] from my father you also receive things
[25:32] using traits
[25:35] good or bad
[25:36] from your parents
[25:39] but i remember because
[25:41] as all of you know when you're going
[25:43] through your teenage years
[25:45] um
[25:46] it's a transition time from childhood
[25:49] into adulthood right
[25:50] and you know when you're a child
[25:52] you cry usually because you're
[25:55] mad or you're hurting or you're hungry
[25:57] or your diaper needs to be changed
[26:00] and so
[26:01] usually crying is an expression of some
[26:04] form of pain grief
[26:07] discontentment suffering right but now
[26:11] i was in my teenage years and we were
[26:13] also going through a lot because we had
[26:15] left the church that i had been raised
[26:17] in for almost 10 years
[26:20] and i found myself now
[26:22] going to another church visiting
[26:25] and i was very
[26:27] very resentful
[26:29] because i did not understand why we had
[26:33] left this other church
[26:34] i did you know
[26:37] there was a lot of issues there but i
[26:39] didn't see all those issues and i wasn't
[26:41] old enough to understand and really for
[26:43] my father to share with me all the
[26:45] reasons
[26:48] and but
[26:50] in the church i was raised in and i've
[26:52] probably shared this before so i
[26:53] apologize if i'm rehashing it but i i
[26:56] just gotta follow what i feel is the
[26:57] leadership of the lord
[26:59] the church i was in was a message
[27:01] believing church
[27:03] but
[27:04] the only other churches we had
[27:06] fellowship with
[27:08] were far away
[27:10] uh one was in new mexico
[27:13] uh for a time there it was like we would
[27:15] reach out and from time to time we'd
[27:16] have fellowship with someone maybe in
[27:18] another state
[27:20] or you know in another territory but
[27:24] it wouldn't take too long before we
[27:25] realized they were off the word and we
[27:27] were we were right and we had to move
[27:29] forward and pray for them you know
[27:33] and we we had missions work in india you
[27:36] know there were believers in india that
[27:38] we knew of there were believers in new
[27:40] mexico that we knew of and
[27:42] um
[27:44] just the the impression that i got
[27:47] whether it was implied or inferred
[27:49] was that
[27:51] our little church was the bride
[27:53] of christ
[27:56] in in north carolina right and maybe
[28:00] maybe on the east coast yeah
[28:02] i mean this was this was the 80s and we
[28:04] had 200 plus people we were
[28:08] at the church the church at that time
[28:09] was one of the larger groups of
[28:11] believers in the area we had people
[28:13] moving up from florida they were seeing
[28:15] the light
[28:16] we had people moving from all over the
[28:18] place coming in was like a revival
[28:21] so i'm thinking
[28:23] if we're leaving this
[28:25] and we're leaving this teaching i
[28:26] believe that my pastor was the joshua
[28:29] that god had raised up to take us on
[28:31] into the promise right after the death
[28:33] of the prophet
[28:35] moses you know i believe this i was 14
[28:38] years old
[28:39] i believe this
[28:41] so i'm thinking we're lost
[28:45] we're i believe this in my heart we're
[28:48] going to hell
[28:50] we're going out here fellowshipping with
[28:51] these serpent seeds and buzzards and
[28:53] foolish virgins and
[28:55] unregenerates and why is my dad doing
[28:59] this to me
[29:00] so i i was rebellious against my dad
[29:02] because i thought he was sending our
[29:05] entire family to the pits of hell
[29:09] but then i go amongst these believers
[29:12] and they begin worshiping and they're
[29:14] singing the same songs we sing
[29:16] they're reading the same quotes we read
[29:18] wow
[29:19] and they're
[29:20] they
[29:22] they pretty much believe the same thing
[29:24] wow now they don't believe it's okay for
[29:26] men to have two three four five or six
[29:28] wives
[29:30] but well maybe i just need to go read
[29:33] the message again
[29:34] because what i'm feeling when i'm
[29:36] amongst these other believers i'm
[29:38] feeling loved
[29:42] they
[29:43] they know i came out of a church that
[29:45] practiced
[29:46] and condoned and promoted polygamy but
[29:48] they still love me
[29:51] this is really
[29:53] giving me a
[29:54] as a paradox
[29:56] because i'm thinking if they knew what i
[29:59] just came out of
[30:00] they wouldn't love me so much
[30:03] they would kind of
[30:05] you know keep me at arm's length keep
[30:08] that distance or treat me like i've got
[30:09] maybe a communicable disease
[30:12] or something like that because i mean
[30:13] we've been taught you do carry spirits
[30:15] you know it's like they're not afraid of
[30:17] me
[30:18] they're embracing me right
[30:20] and i played the piano i started playing
[30:23] the piano when i was about eight years
[30:25] old
[30:26] and i played for my mother
[30:28] and uh she sings just like an angel you
[30:30] know every child thinks that about their
[30:32] mother i know but it's true in in my
[30:35] case
[30:37] but i was so rebellious that i didn't
[30:40] even want to play the piano i didn't
[30:41] want to play for mom
[30:43] i just resented it because i thought
[30:44] we're just wasting our time here amongst
[30:46] all these
[30:47] bullish virgins yeah i mean i was being
[30:50] graceful to call the foolish virgins
[30:51] there is a chance
[30:53] for foolish virgins
[30:55] although we had been taught there wasn't
[30:56] i knew there was because brother ben
[30:58] said they're right
[30:59] anyway
[31:01] you see the the situation i was in but
[31:04] when i would be in those services
[31:08] we had not been taught a whole lot
[31:11] or i had not learned a whole lot about
[31:13] the movement of the holy spirit right
[31:16] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[31:18] and the need to be converted right
[31:23] so i was in these
[31:24] these other rogue churches
[31:27] and i was feeling something
[31:31] that made
[31:33] something on the inside of me won't felt
[31:35] like it was boiling over right
[31:37] amen something on the inside like
[31:40] uh it was a pressure right it really is
[31:43] a literal pressure i feel like i'm gonna
[31:44] burst amen so i'm standing here amongst
[31:48] strange people in a strange church with
[31:50] strange colors on the walls and theater
[31:53] seating and all these i remember exactly
[31:55] where i was when this was happening to
[31:56] me
[31:57] i don't think god how do i express how
[32:01] do i let this out
[32:02] i've got a bit right somehow
[32:05] and i wanted to shout i really didn't
[32:07] want to just scream because something is
[32:10] that
[32:11] working on the inside i wanted to scream
[32:13] right but nobody else around me was
[32:15] screaming so oh my i don't want to break
[32:17] church order you right
[32:19] i wanted to run right but nobody else
[32:21] around me was running so i thought well
[32:23] i don't want to break church or you know
[32:24] i'll be a weirdo these people don't
[32:26] think i'm even more weird because he
[32:28] believes polygamy but he's a pentecostal
[32:30] too you know
[32:31] so all i could do brother sister was
[32:33] just stand there
[32:34] kind of frozen and stiff and then the
[32:37] tears would just start pouring out of my
[32:39] eyes
[32:41] and it was just that outlet right
[32:43] but when my granddaddy told me that i
[32:46] realized
[32:47] that's okay yeah
[32:49] that's normal right that's who i am
[32:53] it's okay to cry it would be okay to
[32:55] shout right i would learn later it would
[32:57] be okay to run around as long as it run
[33:00] over somebody
[33:01] but you understand i when you learn who
[33:04] you are
[33:06] come on brother it's a it's a process of
[33:08] maturity that's right when you learn who
[33:11] you are then you can accept who you are
[33:14] then be who you are be comfortable in
[33:16] your own skin
[33:17] then you can just relax
[33:20] and you can enjoy
[33:22] who you actually are amen
[33:24] now this applies to the natural and it
[33:27] also applies to the spirit
[33:30] i have to be guarded
[33:32] against certain things that are traits
[33:34] that were passed to me by my father and
[33:37] mother right i have to be careful how i
[33:39] come across right i have to be careful
[33:42] how people take me right because people
[33:44] can misunderstand me believe it or not
[33:48] sometimes i'm joking and people don't
[33:50] realize i'm joking
[33:52] my wife
[33:53] a wife or a husband helps you see a side
[33:56] of yourself
[33:57] that otherwise you would not see
[34:00] that's a good thing about a companion
[34:03] they help you see a side of yourself
[34:06] that otherwise you're blind to right
[34:08] yeah you know everyone has a blind side
[34:10] sure that's right you don't have none of
[34:11] you have 360 degree vision
[34:14] so your companion
[34:16] helps cover your blind side right helps
[34:19] show you hey
[34:21] how many of you ever been in the
[34:22] hospital yeah man yeah how many of you
[34:24] ever had to wear a hospital down
[34:29] hospital gals have a blind side
[34:35] and sometimes you're under medication
[34:39] and you're not quite getting on all
[34:41] eight summers anyway so it's really nice
[34:43] to have a companion
[34:46] that can kind of help you see your blind
[34:49] side right now
[34:51] now you all might not want that to go
[34:52] out on the web
[34:56] it's too late anyway
[34:58] by the way
[35:00] you
[35:03] all right you know in formation flying
[35:06] the the blue angels the thunderbirds
[35:09] every pilot has a blind side
[35:12] that's right that's what the teammates
[35:13] there right that's what the wing runs
[35:15] there for right right it's the cover is
[35:17] six right the cover is nine right to
[35:19] cover is
[35:20] three o'clock the sides you can't see
[35:23] because the wing keeps you from seeing
[35:25] the enemy right that's why we need each
[35:28] other
[35:30] these folks that are trying to make a
[35:31] rapture living on an island by
[35:33] themselves
[35:35] with no pastor
[35:37] no brother no sister nobody i i don't
[35:40] know i
[35:41] i wouldn't want to be there that's right
[35:43] i need the family of god amen
[35:46] i need you amen
[35:50] i need you you need me
[35:54] i need a pastor yes sir i need a deacon
[35:57] in my life that's right amen the church
[35:59] meets trustees we all need these things
[36:01] god set in the church
[36:04] gifts right ministries every church
[36:06] perhaps don't have the same needs but
[36:08] god places in the body
[36:10] all of the organs all the members all
[36:13] the everything that's needed to edify
[36:14] that body amen
[36:16] now i've got to get going here with this
[36:18] sermon
[36:19] or the dye pack is going to burst yeah
[36:21] that's right
[36:24] and if you don't understand that don't
[36:25] worry about it
[36:27] i know it but if you do then you get a
[36:29] chuckling on that
[36:31] hearing my granddaddy
[36:33] tell me about
[36:35] who our family is a little just a little
[36:38] glimpse of our family helped me to
[36:40] understand who i am
[36:43] david said in psalm 61 thou has given me
[36:46] the heritage
[36:48] of those that fear thy name amen
[36:52] now what is a heritage if you look it up
[36:54] in the dictionary it'll say it's a
[36:55] property
[36:56] that descends to an heir right
[36:59] that's something that you inherit or you
[37:02] obtain by your birth right by the
[37:04] lineage you're born into right that's
[37:06] right i am not i it's very unlikely that
[37:09] i am in brother samuel dale's will right
[37:12] because my last name is cross
[37:14] it's very unlikely that brother wade is
[37:16] in brother cross's will that's right if
[37:19] we are
[37:20] probably
[37:22] yeah but because not by my choice but by
[37:26] god's forward nation i'm born to the
[37:29] larry cross he's born to samuel del
[37:31] therefore by your birth right you are
[37:34] automatically entitled
[37:36] to certain things that come as a result
[37:39] of your lineage or your predecessor amen
[37:42] right all right so then the second
[37:44] definition something transmitted by
[37:48] or acquired from a predecessor right
[37:51] right definition c something possessed
[37:54] as a result of one's natural situation
[37:57] or birth right now we have in a modern
[38:00] society adoption
[38:02] i can go adopt a child that is not my
[38:04] biological
[38:06] child or offspring but i can make that
[38:08] child that's right right my uh
[38:12] inher inherits
[38:13] give that child inheritance amen i can
[38:15] make that child a beneficiary right of
[38:18] my wealth or poverty there you go amen
[38:20] right through adoption all right right
[38:22] so then as we read in colossians paul
[38:25] said he hath made us to be meat which is
[38:28] able right
[38:30] made us able to be partakers of the
[38:32] inheritance of the saints amen in life
[38:36] paul's not talking about dead people
[38:38] that's right paul's talking about a
[38:40] lineage
[38:41] paul is talking about a bloodline
[38:44] we call it the royal sea amen it is not
[38:47] a natural bloodline if any of you in
[38:49] here are left your turban
[38:51] on the doorstep this is not a the
[38:54] muslims got it wrong right it's not
[38:56] natural
[38:57] it's spiritual right it's by faith
[39:00] it's the faith seed of abraham amen is
[39:03] the royal seed of abraham amen amen
[39:06] it's something that is and it comes down
[39:09] through your bloodline your literature
[39:10] it's something that is passed down
[39:13] from generation
[39:14] to generation that's right now it can be
[39:17] traits
[39:18] or characteristics
[39:20] that are unique
[39:22] to that specific
[39:24] family yes sir
[39:27] i walk a certain way
[39:30] and my brother matthew and i'm you know
[39:32] they all know we all laugh about this in
[39:34] our family and we gotta we've got a
[39:35] crosswalk
[39:39] we hold our head a certain way
[39:41] we bob a certain way
[39:43] and then when we go to take a seat we
[39:45] don't sit down like a normal person
[39:47] most people walk up to the seat turn
[39:50] around
[39:51] and then just sit down
[39:52] and sit around but here's how the
[39:54] crosses do it
[39:56] we do it like landing an airplane
[39:59] we walk and as we get closer we start
[40:03] sort of slide right in
[40:07] now isn't that funny
[40:10] that is the funniest thing but you know
[40:12] what i never went to school to learn how
[40:13] to do that
[40:16] my dad never said now boys you've
[40:19] reached the age i'm going to send you
[40:21] down to the cross reformatory story to
[40:23] teach you how to walk
[40:25] how to you know all the odd and peculiar
[40:28] behaviors of a cross
[40:30] he was born in amen amen he was i didn't
[40:33] even choose it that's right in some ways
[40:36] i might wish i could do something about
[40:38] it
[40:41] if i did i would just be trying to
[40:43] reinvent myself
[40:45] right and i would make myself even more
[40:47] of an oddball
[40:49] trying to become something that i'm i'm
[40:51] just not right right
[40:53] so there's there and you know every
[40:55] family has little little peculiarities
[40:58] about it and they don't all together
[41:00] like them or love them but at some point
[41:02] you just accepted that's who i am
[41:04] right
[41:05] now the same thing with the christian
[41:07] family
[41:08] there are things that are born and bred
[41:11] into you by your birth
[41:13] that you can fight you can hate you can
[41:16] dislike you can try to cover it up with
[41:18] all the
[41:19] all the
[41:20] refinement or makeup or whatever it is
[41:23] you choose but the bottom line is it's
[41:25] who you are right by your birth
[41:27] and you just be better off just to
[41:29] accept that this is the way i am
[41:31] that's why i believe brother brown said
[41:33] or we're tall i don't i can't i don't
[41:35] have a quote for it pick a bible
[41:37] character yeah right
[41:39] that you can identify with
[41:42] that's right it helps you because you
[41:44] have
[41:45] one or a combination of
[41:48] characteristics that are
[41:50] inherited through your spiritual birth
[41:52] amen
[41:53] some people are going to have really
[41:55] strong on the elijah side right they're
[41:57] going to be very bold very adamant very
[42:01] you know my way or the highway oh okay
[42:05] uh she bears come out and kill them all
[42:08] that's that's the elijah strain
[42:11] others are gonna have a milder more
[42:14] tactful more diplomatic more political
[42:17] approach doesn't mean they're a
[42:18] hypocrite right just means they got
[42:20] another strength
[42:21] from their spiritual heritage
[42:23] but you connect with the bible character
[42:25] now
[42:27] i think the uh some of the denominations
[42:29] like the catholics or the presbyterians
[42:31] do this thing with like ordination
[42:34] and you i don't i don't understand how
[42:36] it all works but that there's something
[42:37] they go through where you pick a
[42:40] character
[42:41] and you take a 14
[42:43] course
[42:44] and you study the life of this character
[42:46] and then you
[42:47] are ordained
[42:49] into the church as
[42:52] john the baptist
[42:54] that becomes your new spiritual identity
[42:57] because that's the character you connect
[42:59] with
[43:00] and so
[43:03] brother wade decides i'm john the
[43:05] baptist
[43:06] when i approach brother john
[43:09] not by the way but
[43:10] your brother john because my spiritual
[43:13] brother in christ and i would be brother
[43:17] who brother timothy brother paul
[43:20] if y'all picking y'all want to pick a
[43:22] name
[43:26] you know what i'm saying
[43:27] they they find a character and and
[43:29] they're probably a little bit off
[43:31] balance on that right yeah yeah but you
[43:33] know i know i know message churches
[43:36] where people come in
[43:38] and they change their entire name
[43:40] first middle and last name
[43:41] to gain a new identity
[43:43] it's a form of brainwashing right
[43:45] exactly
[43:47] sure
[43:48] it's a form of brainwashing but you see
[43:50] they're taking something that has a
[43:53] balanced application right and they're
[43:55] taking it to an extremely way off
[43:57] facebook
[43:59] and i and you know i suppose if they
[44:00] change churches again they're gonna
[44:02] change names and now when you meet him
[44:03] you don't know what name to call him
[44:05] right
[44:06] because you don't know if he's brother
[44:07] harry or brother jonathan or brother
[44:10] zechariah you know what i'm saying
[44:13] but you do i believe that's why the
[44:15] prophet said find a character right you
[44:17] identify with because what you're
[44:19] actually doing there is you're seeing
[44:21] your family tree right right
[44:23] i think that's what david did
[44:26] right david just began to look back over
[44:29] the path in the course of his life
[44:32] and watch how
[44:34] he was confronted with situations he was
[44:37] tempted he was tested he was tried
[44:40] things
[44:41] things were thrown in him that he didn't
[44:43] ask for right he didn't choose and
[44:46] you know sometimes when you just get
[44:48] thrown right in the middle of something
[44:49] you don't have time to plan your
[44:51] reaction right right that's correct you
[44:53] don't have time to think through how am
[44:55] i going to deal with this you just act
[44:57] right it just and then the real you
[44:59] shows out
[45:01] your instincts take over uh your
[45:03] genetics all of these things take over
[45:05] and sometimes when you look back you
[45:08] like the what you see and sometimes you
[45:09] you wish you could
[45:11] relive that right at least the portion
[45:13] of those commands that's right
[45:14] but i believe that david could look back
[45:16] over his life and say i never asked to
[45:18] be king right
[45:20] i never asked for a lion to attack
[45:23] i never requested a bear right right
[45:26] i never requested
[45:28] uh
[45:30] a bathsheba right i never re we would
[45:33] have never
[45:34] prescribed right life's trials for
[45:37] ourselves that's right if god could have
[45:39] given us arrest and said abc or d
[45:42] do you want to have to contend with
[45:43] adultery
[45:45] drug addiction
[45:47] immoral living
[45:50] bank robbery
[45:51] thieving lying stealing whatever right
[45:54] now you get to pick your temptation we
[45:57] would have all gone for the easiest
[45:59] option all right or we would have gone
[46:00] for the fill in the blank right yeah and
[46:02] we just said i want to be tempted to lay
[46:04] out a church when i you know when
[46:07] when the the masters are on yeah
[46:10] i can beat that one yeah
[46:12] i can beat that one or maybe maybe not
[46:14] everybody right but you know what i'm
[46:15] saying you would pick the one you know
[46:17] you could conquer but we don't get to
[46:18] pick that right
[46:19] god picks up right
[46:21] god for ordains even our trials right
[46:24] our test god knows before he permits
[46:27] satan to throw that at you he knows what
[46:30] your reaction's going to be
[46:33] you're not proving anything to god right
[46:35] he's on missions
[46:37] he's infinite
[46:39] you are proving to the devil
[46:42] and you are proving to yourself right
[46:44] amen who you really are right amen job
[46:47] didn't prove anything to god right
[46:49] god never questioned right it was satan
[46:52] that had the question
[46:54] satan said if you do a b and c
[46:56] job will do x y z and god said no he
[46:59] won't
[47:00] he will not
[47:02] because god knew his his his genetic
[47:05] composition right right god knew what
[47:07] was really on the inside of job satan
[47:10] was looking at the shell satan was
[47:12] looking at the riches and the wealth and
[47:14] the and the modern wife and all these
[47:17] things and satan said corrupt this
[47:19] take that away defile that remove the
[47:22] family take take all of the peripheral
[47:24] away and the heart of job will
[47:28] curse you
[47:30] we'll curse you god and god said no he
[47:31] won't amen i know his heart
[47:34] right i gave him his heart
[47:37] all right he knew who his father was
[47:40] but satan was the one that needed
[47:42] needed to be it needed to be
[47:44] demonstrated to you brother and sister
[47:45] satan's a doubter
[47:47] he's the doubter right he's the source
[47:49] of all doubt he's the source of all fear
[47:52] he's the source of all sickness the
[47:54] prophet of god taught these things he's
[47:56] the originator of all of this and you're
[47:58] caught in the middle right amen that's
[48:00] right you are caught in the middle
[48:03] between both voices
[48:05] satan will tell you oh you're just
[48:08] living this way because your parents
[48:09] thought it to you yeah i know he says
[48:11] that because he told me that right right
[48:14] you're just an actor
[48:16] you're just a hypocrite you're a
[48:18] two-face
[48:19] you're one person at church and another
[48:22] person at work and satan was right
[48:25] i was a hypocrite
[48:28] but i was easily influenced right i was
[48:31] easily persuaded when i was in church i
[48:33] loved what i was feeling i believed what
[48:36] i was hearing i wanted to be a christian
[48:38] with all of my heart
[48:40] but i didn't want to believe that all my
[48:42] coworkers was bound for hell either
[48:45] right and so i'm thinking how can i
[48:47] relate to them how can i be a friend to
[48:50] them without going over the line
[48:55] there was a time in my life i believed
[48:57] if i watched the television
[48:59] i was going to hell
[49:02] i learned later that wasn't true
[49:05] but i believed this
[49:07] in my childish mind and we didn't have
[49:08] television growing up i thank the lord
[49:11] we've never had it in our home
[49:13] uh our parents was you know we were we
[49:15] were very strict we were raised strict
[49:17] and i thank god for that i'm not
[49:18] condemning any what it does i just tell
[49:20] you my experience amen but i believe
[49:22] that looking at television was a sin and
[49:25] sin the wages of sin is death and and
[49:28] sin leads you to hell right
[49:30] well on thanksgiving
[49:33] we had to go to my aunt's house
[49:36] and my uncle's house and and we had a
[49:38] friend in our family who was a doctor
[49:39] and
[49:40] they all had they had tvs in every room
[49:42] yeah
[49:43] and on thanksgiving day this
[49:46] christian holiday which is the the last
[49:49] bastion
[49:51] of christianity in american culture
[49:55] and the day that's designed to give
[49:57] thanks and praise unto god for this
[49:59] glorious bounty that he's bestowed upon
[50:02] us and we take the natural and see it
[50:03] through the spiritual for the rest so we
[50:05] thank god for this newfound land right
[50:07] the baptism of the holy so
[50:11] but here we are now i know on on
[50:13] wednesday nights
[50:15] little tim is in church
[50:17] he's saying god
[50:19] and i know that tomorrow i'm going to
[50:22] have to face the devil
[50:25] he's a 36 inch devil
[50:27] and my uncle's gonna be watching him and
[50:29] my aunt's gonna be watching it and my
[50:32] cousins are gonna be watching it and i
[50:34] can't pry my eyes off of it
[50:39] and it's just a football game
[50:41] but there's them commercials on there
[50:44] and there's all that demonic and i know
[50:46] all of that stuff but you understand the
[50:49] predicament
[50:50] and and really this would have been a
[50:52] great time to be a catholic yeah
[50:55] because i could have just bought an
[50:56] indulgence yeah
[50:58] i could have went ahead and pre-paid for
[51:01] my sin
[51:02] and been had a clear conscience but we
[51:04] weren't taught catholicism so therefore
[51:07] i'm trying to repent right i'm trying to
[51:09] get grace and strength encourage god i'm
[51:11] serious i was saying lord jesus help me
[51:14] never look at that tv tomorrow
[51:16] that was my desire
[51:17] i didn't want to look at it
[51:21] well they also had a pinball machine
[51:24] the doctor
[51:25] was a man of
[51:27] modest wealth and had a pinball machine
[51:30] well that was the devil too
[51:32] yeah
[51:33] because it it had a kind of uh
[51:35] semi-provocative
[51:37] woman up on it it made all these sounds
[51:39] old-timey pinholes she did the buzz and
[51:42] all skydivers falling all these demonic
[51:46] voices that came out of it
[51:48] i love to play that game
[51:51] but that was the devil too
[51:54] well he did have a tuba
[51:56] but i couldn't play the tuba
[51:59] so what am i going to do you understand
[52:01] i don't know where i'm even going with
[52:03] this
[52:04] way i want to live now but this this is
[52:06] the predicament that you're in and i
[52:08] know tomorrow i'm going to go there and
[52:11] i'm going to i'm going to end up
[52:12] watching that tv
[52:14] and i'm going to end up playing that
[52:15] pinball game and then i got to go back
[52:17] to church and ask god forgiveness and i
[52:19] think why would god even forgive me
[52:21] yeah
[52:22] when i knew i was gonna do it before i
[52:24] asked pre-forgiveness for what i was
[52:26] gonna do
[52:27] and i ended up doing exactly what i do i
[52:29] was gonna accept i only watched it
[52:30] longer
[52:35] i skipped dessert and played pinball
[52:37] because i had it to myself
[52:41] remember i've got four brothers and two
[52:43] sisters
[52:44] and we were all wanting to play the
[52:46] pinball game yeah so little tim could
[52:48] play it while everybody else was eating
[52:49] their dessert they think well i'm not
[52:51] getting fat
[52:54] but i am indulging
[52:56] at the same time it was sinful
[52:58] you
[53:09] we're really not dealing
[53:11] with the evils
[53:15] we're dealing with something that's in
[53:17] here
[53:19] something that needs to die right
[53:21] something that needs to be extinguished
[53:24] something that needs to have a proper
[53:25] burial right
[53:27] and a funeral service and and maybe even
[53:29] a cremation i don't know
[53:31] something that needs to completely die
[53:34] and then you know what once that change
[53:36] takes place
[53:38] and god gives you that birth right and
[53:41] you recognize who you are
[53:43] there ain't enough televisions in the
[53:45] world
[53:46] to change that
[53:48] there ain't enough pinball machines in
[53:49] the world they're in enough football
[53:51] games they're gonna ill dress ill-fated
[53:54] stripteases in the world i am a son of
[53:57] god i am a daughter of god
[53:59] that is disgusting that is repulsive to
[54:02] me amen it might catch my eye for a
[54:05] second and it might be fascinating to
[54:07] walk into walmart and see uh ice age on
[54:10] the computer on the tv there but i know
[54:12] i'm not going to hell because ice age
[54:14] caught my attention i'm going to heaven
[54:16] because before the foundation of the
[54:17] world god had me in his mind and i'm
[54:20] just an expression of his
[54:23] here on earth to be tempted tested tried
[54:26] and battled with sin but really god sees
[54:28] the end from the beginning and knows
[54:30] that in the end i'll overcome i'll
[54:32] conquer it i'll come out on topic man
[54:35] satan will be down there i'll be up
[54:37] there and so when god brings us to that
[54:40] it puts us at ease
[54:43] yes sir
[54:44] we can be comfortable in our own escape
[54:46] right brother sister i did not have all
[54:47] this in my notes i hope it's helpful
[54:50] this morning
[54:51] all right but now there's folks that
[54:53] take predestination
[54:54] yeah come on and they'll go out there
[54:56] and they'll fill every room in their
[54:57] house with the television
[55:03] they'll do it all
[55:04] man they got grace
[55:06] grace
[55:07] we believe in predestination
[55:09] i'll have you to know i'm not going to
[55:11] hell because i've got a television
[55:12] they're exactly right all right i'll
[55:14] have you know i'm not going to hell
[55:16] because uh i've got olympic sized
[55:18] swimming pool that's exactly right yeah
[55:20] that swimming pool ain't gonna send you
[55:22] to that right
[55:23] but see
[55:27] i went to brother's home one time
[55:29] he's got a pool table
[55:32] pool table's not going to send you to
[55:33] help right right
[55:36] he's got a ping-pong table ping-pong
[55:38] table's not going to send you the hat
[55:40] that's right hey man he's got a slot
[55:43] machine
[55:46] uh-oh
[55:50] nope
[55:51] the slot machine is not going to send
[55:53] them to hell right
[55:56] but the slot machine
[56:00] and the pool table and the swimming pool
[56:04] and all of these other things
[56:08] are saying something
[56:09] about what's going on in that man's
[56:11] heart right
[56:13] right because the prophet said apply the
[56:16] token right
[56:18] clean out
[56:19] the trash
[56:20] all right there are some things that
[56:22] will never have any edifying value right
[56:28] right
[56:31] and what may be
[56:33] okay for brother wade to do right might
[56:36] not be okay for you to do because you
[56:38] can't hold it in balance right right
[56:40] that's right
[56:42] but where do you draw the line right
[56:44] i draw the line at the slot machine
[56:47] some people draw the line at the pool
[56:48] table right some people draw the line at
[56:51] the swimming pool
[56:52] but a lot of it is not necessarily we've
[56:55] got our list of 10 commandments from
[56:57] william bratton a lot of is what's evil
[57:00] to you
[57:01] and that doesn't put us on that slippery
[57:03] slope of what's evil to me oh my it's
[57:05] not evil to me to go to gab go to vegas
[57:07] and go gambling that's wrong that's
[57:09] right amen gambling is against the bible
[57:13] gambling is contrary to the scripture
[57:15] amen
[57:16] there are some things that are very
[57:17] black and white right and there's some
[57:19] things that are great area but the main
[57:20] thing is knowing who you are
[57:22] and then i think sometimes we have to
[57:24] ask ourselves the question all right
[57:27] there's a desire
[57:29] there's a desire here
[57:32] i've got a desire i love to fly
[57:33] airplanes
[57:34] i don't mean the little remote control i
[57:36] like to fly
[57:37] real planes
[57:38] man is that a sid
[57:42] no
[57:43] but now if i go plunk down
[57:46] ten thousand dollars
[57:48] and reserve myself a flight instructor
[57:51] and he says tim
[57:52] here's how we'll do this to get you to
[57:54] private pilot as quickly as possible
[57:56] we're gonna what's your work schedule i
[57:58] said we're monday through friday 7 30 to
[58:00] 5 and i get off at 2 30 on friday he
[58:02] says all right here's the deal we can
[58:04] get you to private pilot in eight weeks
[58:06] we'll start friday afternoon at 5pm
[58:09] we'll fly friday evening eight hours on
[58:11] saturday and eight hours on sunday
[58:15] we got a problem
[58:18] flying is not a sin
[58:20] right
[58:21] aviation is not a sin
[58:23] skipping church
[58:26] to indulge myself in a personal interest
[58:30] becomes a problem
[58:32] fill in the blank right
[58:35] golf
[58:36] basketball basket weaving doesn't matter
[58:42] i'm trying to hit the brothers and the
[58:44] sisters
[58:45] soccer practice
[58:47] academics well i'm studying for the
[58:49] s.a.t
[58:51] trust god
[58:52] god will not ask you to forfeit
[58:55] his commandment and his will for your
[58:57] life in order for you to achieve what
[59:00] may just be a personal goal and not the
[59:02] lord's will for your life right amen you
[59:04] are not you know you hear people say oh
[59:07] well he lost his religion
[59:09] well it's probably a good thing
[59:11] because if you've got a religion that
[59:13] you can lose or lay down right you've
[59:15] got a religion
[59:19] because a true covering is not something
[59:22] you could put on or take off that's a
[59:23] costume
[59:24] when god dresses his bride to close her
[59:28] in his righteousness
[59:29] and he says do not edit it right do not
[59:32] alter it do not take it off do not amend
[59:34] it do not revise it do not update it
[59:37] amen
[59:39] we got a lot of people trying to update
[59:41] the bible trying to update the message
[59:43] trying to say i know brother brown said
[59:45] but that's a goat that's right
[59:48] a goat says buck
[59:50] a sheep says amen
[59:53] amen if the prophet of god said if the
[59:55] bible said it god stands behind it i say
[59:58] amen amen amen the prophet of god never
[1:00:01] gave us
[1:00:03] room or permission to tailor our dress
[1:00:06] spiritually or naturally according to
[1:00:08] fashions
[1:00:10] if the fashions of the world influence
[1:00:12] or dictate even if we're just a few
[1:00:14] notches down
[1:00:16] if we move up a few notches when the
[1:00:17] world moves up a few notches and we're
[1:00:19] following the wrong leadership right
[1:00:22] remember the church of the usa
[1:00:25] and the right
[1:00:27] one had her eyes
[1:00:29] one had her eyes on the worldly church
[1:00:32] the other had her eyes on the prophet
[1:00:34] right man
[1:00:35] where you're looking has a very large
[1:00:37] bearing upon where you're going right
[1:00:40] amen i like to ride motorcycles
[1:00:45] there you go i got you i got you those
[1:00:48] two-wheel demons
[1:00:52] i got that from my dad
[1:00:54] he rides motorcycles
[1:00:56] you know where i got flying from my
[1:00:57] granddad he was an air force
[1:01:00] engineer on bombers he never flew active
[1:01:03] duty never flew combat he trained
[1:01:06] other engineers to ship them overseas to
[1:01:08] do combat duty motorcycling is not a
[1:01:11] seat but i learned something in
[1:01:12] motorcycling
[1:01:14] when you're going around a curve
[1:01:16] you've got to look
[1:01:18] where you want to go that's right right
[1:01:20] that's right you don't look
[1:01:22] right and where
[1:01:25] you're going to end up somewhere else
[1:01:26] than where you wanted to be right right
[1:01:28] because when you lay that bike over it
[1:01:30] doesn't matter how fast you're going you
[1:01:31] don't have to be flying you can be doing
[1:01:33] 35 miles an hour when you lay that bike
[1:01:35] over you either want to hug the yellow
[1:01:37] line or the white line or somewhere in
[1:01:39] the middle
[1:01:40] and actually where you focus your eyes
[1:01:42] is where those tires are
[1:01:45] aligned that's the truth
[1:01:46] i learned that reading magazines
[1:01:51] i was following a friend of mine one
[1:01:52] time a neighbor he had a ninja and i had
[1:01:55] a
[1:01:55] a honda
[1:01:57] 650 uh vx it was uh just a cruiser like
[1:02:01] and he really knew how to carve those
[1:02:03] turrets
[1:02:04] and he got me in a turn i was following
[1:02:06] we weren't going fast at all there's a
[1:02:07] little tiny winding kind of back road
[1:02:11] and the next thing i know i was on the
[1:02:12] white line
[1:02:14] and i was inches away from grass which
[1:02:17] is wipeout right yes sir and training
[1:02:20] had to kick you right you do not panic
[1:02:22] right you do not jam on the brakes
[1:02:25] you do not even make a huge throttle
[1:02:27] adjustment
[1:02:28] you look and lean right
[1:02:31] came up to jesus
[1:02:34] and lean on jesus
[1:02:36] you have to end up right where you want
[1:02:38] to go
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] you're looking at at the signpost
[1:02:43] or you're looking at the warning sign or
[1:02:45] you're looking over off to the south
[1:02:47] shore i said oh god i'm going to crash
[1:02:49] you're going to crash
[1:02:50] right because you went where you were
[1:02:51] looking right
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:55] amen even if you all died
[1:02:57] i know young or all that things you get
[1:02:59] your eyes on the things your attention
[1:03:01] gets fixated on end up drawing you right
[1:03:04] into it right like a moth to a light
[1:03:06] right right amen so we can sing the song
[1:03:09] right now turn
[1:03:10] your eyes
[1:03:12] on jesus
[1:03:14] seek ye first
[1:03:16] the kingdom of god amen
[1:03:21] do you know that as long as the desire
[1:03:23] of your heart in no way conflicts
[1:03:25] with god's word
[1:03:27] i believe if you live long enough and
[1:03:30] you obey god
[1:03:32] well enough
[1:03:33] and you keep your priorities right i
[1:03:35] believe god will allow you to enjoy
[1:03:39] those little luxuries right those little
[1:03:41] pleasantries those little things that i
[1:03:43] don't know that will happen in the
[1:03:44] millennium or the future hall yeah but
[1:03:46] here
[1:03:47] brother brendan liked to hunt
[1:03:49] right brother ben liked to fish
[1:03:52] nothing wrong with those couldn't let it
[1:03:54] get in the way of his ministry that's
[1:03:55] right he had to allocate time to
[1:03:58] ministry and he had to allocate time to
[1:03:59] hunting and fishing right and he kept
[1:04:01] the two very well managed right
[1:04:04] we've got to do the same thing right i
[1:04:05] believe the time should go on long
[1:04:06] enough i could i can become a private
[1:04:08] pilot
[1:04:10] i could do anything pretty much i desire
[1:04:12] to do as long as my desires don't
[1:04:14] conflict like the will of god or the
[1:04:17] word of god or is playing for my life
[1:04:19] but you also have to realize keep your
[1:04:21] priorities straight right now right
[1:04:23] because if you get them out of balance
[1:04:24] you're going to end up going way off
[1:04:26] here out in orbit right and you're going
[1:04:28] to get scarred
[1:04:30] you're going to get hurt you're going to
[1:04:31] lose precious years of your life that
[1:04:33] you can never re-live
[1:04:36] and not because your desires were evil
[1:04:38] but because you didn't know how to
[1:04:41] react to those desires right right and
[1:04:43] let god's leadership right be first and
[1:04:46] foremost amen that's right
[1:04:48] wow
[1:04:49] i i where am i going from here
[1:04:53] this is truth right it's simple but it's
[1:04:56] true
[1:04:56] and it's good and it's wholesome this
[1:04:58] just seems to be my ministry
[1:05:00] i have a difficult time laying out point
[1:05:01] a b and c and building a bridge and
[1:05:03] getting everybody from here to there and
[1:05:05] i just have to go with whatever the lord
[1:05:07] leads right and then stop when it's time
[1:05:09] to stop
[1:05:10] amen all right
[1:05:14] these are things that are bred into you
[1:05:16] and you can't help it
[1:05:17] these are tendencies that never had to
[1:05:19] be taught
[1:05:20] trained schooled learned i never had to
[1:05:22] go to cross reform seminary right uh i
[1:05:25] wish i could have gone to another school
[1:05:27] to unlearn some of the things
[1:05:30] they're there by your natural growth
[1:05:32] uh now
[1:05:33] maybe i'll i'll cover this and we'll
[1:05:35] come to a stopping place
[1:05:37] that's the great thing about morning and
[1:05:39] evening services
[1:05:40] you just stop and pick up where you left
[1:05:42] off right right
[1:05:44] with certain families you know you hear
[1:05:46] these names
[1:05:47] um rockefeller
[1:05:49] yeah rockefeller you know there's people
[1:05:52] that try to make their last name
[1:05:53] rockefeller
[1:05:55] just to be associated with wealth
[1:05:57] they're imposters right but they want to
[1:05:59] change their last name because that's a
[1:06:01] that's a well-known name

[1:06:34] my god
[1:06:35] wow
[1:06:36] yeah whatever i'm being silly now but
[1:06:38] there is name association and with that
[1:06:41] name comes certain uh
[1:06:43] pre-formed conclusions right amen wealth
[1:06:47] prosperity banking right oil
[1:06:51] uh gold mining whatever it may be you
[1:06:53] know politics
[1:06:55] uh liquor business
[1:06:58] cigarettes right whatever it is there's
[1:07:00] name association so people there and
[1:07:02] then these these are what we would call
[1:07:04] dynasties right these are dynasties
[1:07:06] right and i want to tell you within
[1:07:08] those families we see this in the royal
[1:07:11] dynasty of england britain right man
[1:07:15] do you know how much they would love to
[1:07:17] change prince harry's last name
[1:07:21] that guy yeah man he's got a whole team
[1:07:24] of people
[1:07:26] to to wipe to to go behind him and clean
[1:07:29] up his mess
[1:07:31] that's the truth public relations he's
[1:07:33] got a whole team of people that are
[1:07:34] keeping the media at bay right keeping
[1:07:36] the cameras at bay keeping the tabloid
[1:07:39] just feeding them a little bit to give
[1:07:40] them something but you know what i'm
[1:07:42] saying they're trying to cover up
[1:07:43] because this guy's royalty but he's not
[1:07:46] acting like him right right
[1:07:47] he's royalty but the schools have not
[1:07:50] been effective right in changing his
[1:07:53] conduct and his heart to act like royals
[1:07:56] amen so instead they're taking all of
[1:07:58] these measures to try to enforce royal
[1:08:01] behavior or at least project a royal
[1:08:04] image
[1:08:05] out to the world and brother they've got
[1:08:08] they've got wealth that will never be
[1:08:09] exhausted right so they can spend
[1:08:12] millions upon millions of dollars to buy
[1:08:14] off the media to buy off the news
[1:08:16] outlets to buy off everybody to say keep
[1:08:19] this little prince harry
[1:08:21] in this
[1:08:22] glass bubble
[1:08:25] where people can shake it and snow will
[1:08:28] fall but eventually everything settles
[1:08:30] and he's still a prince yeah
[1:08:32] we don't get that luxury that's right
[1:08:34] amen but oh how we will try yeah with
[1:08:38] little johnny
[1:08:39] and we raised them in the message church
[1:08:42] and we told them
[1:08:43] all the principles all the precepts we
[1:08:46] train them up in the ways you go and all
[1:08:47] of a sudden little johnny one day all of
[1:08:50] the training all of the reform all of
[1:08:53] the legalism
[1:08:54] it's evident it's not working yeah
[1:08:57] and we're scared to even submit a prayer
[1:08:59] request because it's going to crush the
[1:09:01] whole church's image of little johnny or
[1:09:02] little susie and what we as perfect
[1:09:05] parents raise them to be and now it's
[1:09:07] like there's a worm that's got an end
[1:09:09] there a virus and it's defecting the
[1:09:10] whole software system and they're
[1:09:12] crashing and we're keep trying to prop
[1:09:14] them up yeah pop them up
[1:09:16] and eventually you realize as a parrot
[1:09:18] you can't right
[1:09:20] and you feel like a failure
[1:09:23] you feel like you failed that child you
[1:09:25] failed that son and you failed that
[1:09:26] dollar you didn't right
[1:09:29] it's just
[1:09:30] their genetics caught up with them right
[1:09:36] their genetics caught up with them
[1:09:38] and now they need another set of
[1:09:40] genetics right
[1:09:41] that's right and they'll catch up with
[1:09:43] amen yes sir oh god's arms
[1:09:47] are longer right right
[1:09:49] than your legs
[1:09:52] you can run but you can't hide that's
[1:09:55] right you can run prodigal

[1:11:52] even if it's on their deathbed sure
[1:11:54] absolutely
[1:11:56] at some point
[1:11:57] but until you don't have any children
[1:11:59] why are you why are you saying it's
[1:12:00] because it's true
[1:12:02] i can speak truth even if i don't have
[1:12:03] experience
[1:12:06] at some point you cannot do any more for
[1:12:10] that child that's correct
[1:12:12] place them in the hands of god
[1:12:16] and say god
[1:12:17] thy will
[1:12:19] be done amen
[1:12:21] and god give me the grace to stay out of
[1:12:23] your way
[1:12:24] all right so you finish your perfect
[1:12:26] work in your life right
[1:12:28] you know what that'll help that child
[1:12:30] yeah and it'll help you too right
[1:12:32] your faith is being built right
[1:12:34] your faith is being streamed you're not
[1:12:36] as perfect as you might have thought you
[1:12:38] were that's right and the flaws that
[1:12:40] you're seeing now those cracks that are
[1:12:42] becoming so evident
[1:12:44] that they cannot be
[1:12:46] covered up with all the pace
[1:12:49] mortar in the world right are many times
[1:12:51] a reflection of the flaws that were in
[1:12:53] your life right
[1:12:54] and you realize
[1:12:56] they need grace
[1:12:57] yeah man that's right he doesn't excuse
[1:13:00] their behavior nope doesn't excuse their
[1:13:03] actions it doesn't excuse yours either
[1:13:05] right but we hold on gracious amen yes
[1:13:07] sir
[1:13:08] and we have to be just as willing to
[1:13:10] meet it out right as we are
[1:13:13] just scooping in amen that's right oh we
[1:13:16] love grace i'm grace yeah i need grace i
[1:13:18] need chris
[1:13:19] brother jones needs grace
[1:13:23] but brother jones i gave him grace 10
[1:13:25] years ago
[1:13:26] and he steal this
[1:13:28] give him grace
[1:13:30] i need the benefit of the doubt
[1:13:33] right so does sister mcgillicuddy right
[1:13:37] give the same grace
[1:13:39] and give the same benefit of the doubt
[1:13:42] that you like to indulge in yourself
[1:13:44] right we'll be
[1:13:46] you know setting yourself up as a judge
[1:13:48] is a miserable place to be right amen
[1:13:51] because to properly judge you've got to
[1:13:53] have all the evidence right
[1:13:55] and none of us aren't privileged in that
[1:13:58] right
[1:13:59] only god
[1:14:00] knows all right only god holds all the
[1:14:03] evidence right so if we start judging
[1:14:05] we're judging based on limited evidence
[1:14:07] which
[1:14:09] which
[1:14:10] hinders our ability to judge fairly
[1:14:12] right or just that's right so the best
[1:14:15] thing is is to be your own judge right
[1:14:18] because you've got more evidence on
[1:14:19] yourself than anybody else that's right
[1:14:21] and the bottom line at the end of the
[1:14:23] day commit the judgment to god right say
[1:14:25] god i'm in your hands right you judge me
[1:14:28] right right
[1:14:30] and none of us won't judge me
[1:14:32] we don't want god's justice we like his
[1:14:36] mercy
[1:14:36] amen mercy
[1:14:38] grace as well all right can we stand on
[1:14:40] our feet woman
[1:14:42] i didn't even get a third of the way
[1:14:44] through this but i don't want the dye
[1:14:46] packet to burst
[1:14:49] so
[1:14:51] we'll just resume this evening if the
[1:14:53] lord amen
[1:14:55] really amen yes sir do you love the lord
[1:14:57] this morning amen
[1:14:59] i hope
[1:15:00] that in this if you take nothing else
[1:15:02] away from the service this morning i
[1:15:04] hope it at least put your soul at peace
[1:15:06] right to realize god has it all in
[1:15:08] control right right god knows the end
[1:15:11] from the beginning we're somewhere in
[1:15:13] the middle right and many times we only
[1:15:16] by his grace get lifted up to get a
[1:15:18] little glimpse say oh it's gonna be okay
[1:15:21] right but if he doesn't
[1:15:22] it doesn't allow that or permit that we
[1:15:25] just have to have faith right all right
[1:15:26] it's going to be okay amen that's right
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] i wonder if we could sing that little
[1:15:31] song out of the key of f i believe that
