[5:48] &gt;&gt; So,
[5:50] you know, something about music, God can
[5:53] reveal itself through music, through
[5:56] languages that um if you just listen to
[6:00] that small voice speak to you through
[6:02] that. And you know the song is as a deer
[6:05] panteth for the water so my soul
[6:09] thirst after thee. Don't lose that
[6:11] thirst in your life.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; If you're not thirsty pray for it
[6:16] &gt;&gt; because you're you are quenching that
[6:18] thirst in you with something. It could
[6:20] be the things of the world but it's
[6:22] meant for the one who created you.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it takes a long time in
[6:26] people's lives and young folks and old
[6:28] folks to find that. But
[6:31] &gt;&gt; make sure you have that thirst. Stay
[6:32] thirsty after him. Amen. Let that be the
[6:35] driving force. You know, Brother Brham
[6:37] preached about a thirst and I didn't
[6:39] know that
[6:40] &gt;&gt; God made a thirst in a soul.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; You're hungering for something. You're
[6:44] looking for purpose in life and you
[6:46] realize it's it's a hymn.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Stay thirsty. Amen.

[18:13] Amen. We had a wonderful time yesterday.
[18:16] We appreciate everybody for coming and
[18:18] cooking and all that. We had uh had a a
[18:21] rather large crowd yesterday. So, we
[18:23] sure appreciate all the food that you
[18:25] that you cooked. And brother Daryl
[18:27] poured his heart out yesterday. Well,
[18:28] he's rested up, ready to pour his heart
[18:30] out again today. And uh he'll be with us
[18:34] uh today. And then we'll uh I'll be
[18:36] speaking this coming Wednesday and get
[18:37] everything started. Sunday before
[18:39] [music] Sunday,
[18:41] it's going to sound weird. We're going
[18:42] to start on the seals, but I want you to
[18:43] read Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[18:45] Read the book. Listen to the tape.
[18:47] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[18:50] All right. Between now and Sunday,
[18:52] Sunday, we'll start on the uh on the
[18:54] seals and the teaching there. But just
[18:57] keep us in prayer. You stay in prayer
[18:59] for yourself that we'll receive. And
[19:02] just remember, too, that the banquet,
[19:03] you need to RSVP or sign up downstairs.
[19:06] If you're bringing someone with you, uh
[19:09] a couple, now these couples now, not
[19:12] individual, couples. If you're bringing
[19:14] couples with you, we need to RSVP them
[19:17] also. That way we can have enough for
[19:19] the caterer and that Anna and them can
[19:21] get all the um plates all to accommodate
[19:25] that many people. Uh the group from Ohio
[19:28] is coming and they're going to be here
[19:30] Friday and we're going to uh have a
[19:32] little fellowship with them and then
[19:33] Saturday and then brother Isaac will be
[19:35] speaking just for a few moments Saturday
[19:37] at the banquet and then Sunday brother
[19:39] Eric Gael from Honduras uh will be here
[19:42] speaking for us on Sunday they're coming
[19:43] to the banquet also. So uh we when we
[19:46] were what when we were over there in
[19:48] what December uh Christine we were there
[19:50] in December and I asked him I said you
[19:52] like to come. He said yeah I'd like to
[19:53] come. I said, "Well, you're preaching
[19:54] that Sunday." If you come, if you're
[19:56] going to drive all the way from
[19:57] Honduras, you might as well do
[19:58] something.
[20:00] But everybody knows Brother Eric and we
[20:02] love him and support him and and love
[20:04] him with the love of the Lord. So, and
[20:05] also remember that if you are coming to
[20:08] the banquet, there will be and you need
[20:10] to or we can help you make arrangements
[20:14] for babysitting because there's some
[20:16] won't be going. I think maybe there'll
[20:18] be some coming from Ohio that's single
[20:20] that may help, but we will find a
[20:22] babysitter somewhere. [clears throat] My
[20:25] house is open like it always is. Hannah,
[20:27] my daughter, said she would be there to
[20:29] help us. So, if anybody needs a
[20:31] babysitter, uh we'll find you one. But,
[20:34] uh this is this is a uh I don't know,
[20:37] we've tried to figure out how many years
[20:38] it was. It's at least 15 or more that
[20:41] we've had the the Valentine's banquet,
[20:43] and it's got bigger and bigger every
[20:44] year. So, uh, it's just a time we can
[20:46] all get together and what said there
[20:49] stays there.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; One more time, what's said there stays
[20:54] there.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; No, we have a good time in the Lord.
[20:58] We'll have a good catered meal and then
[20:59] we will uh then we'll uh do some games
[21:02] and prizes and have brother Isaac speak
[21:04] a minute for us and and then we will uh
[21:07] have a good time just fellowshipping
[21:08] with each other. Uh, good to see brother
[21:10] K's with us today. I missed you the
[21:12] other day when I wasn't here, but good
[21:13] to see you, man. Good, good to have you
[21:14] with us. And uh we love you with the
[21:16] love of the Lord. Good to have our
[21:18] brother back with us there. Good to see
[21:19] you. Yep. Good to have you back with us.
[21:21] Amen. You ready for the word?
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; This is the most important thing.
[21:24] Listen, I sp I spoke Wednesday in what?
[21:26] Expectation. Did you expect you was
[21:28] going to hear from God today?
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; I got up this morning expecting that God
[21:32] was going to speak to me through song,
[21:36] Jeffrey, and Amy.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:40] [applause]
[21:45] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[21:45] &gt;&gt; That was a surprise.
[21:49] It really wasn't a surprise.
[21:51] Something I was expecting. So, the Lord
[21:54] places people in, takes people out, puts
[21:56] people in. If God does it, it's always
[21:59] going to be successful. Always. [music]
[22:01] &gt;&gt; So, good to have them. They've grown up
[22:02] in this church, brought their kids up in
[22:05] the church, and we sure do appreciate
[22:06] them and appreciate that uh Brother Jeff
[22:09] helping us out there with the with our
[22:12] responsive reading. So, all minds and
[22:14] hearts clear, you're expecting
[22:16] something.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; We're expecting to hear from God today.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not expecting to hear
[22:21] from God, like I said before, if you're
[22:23] expecting and you got so much
[22:25] expectation, just drop a little over on
[22:27] your neighbor that ain't expecting much.
[22:29] [music]
[22:30] Amen. If your cup overflows, what does
[22:32] it do? Just makes a mess everywhere,
[22:34] doesn't it? Just all falls all over the
[22:35] counter and everything. Well, all right,
[22:37] Sister Regina, you just let it all pour
[22:39] out. Let it all go and we'll be sitting
[22:42] over there and get all kind of wet. I
[22:44] want to get wet by the what? The water
[22:45] of the word.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So, let's sing as our brother comes,
[22:48] Brother Daryl Ward from Johnson City,
[22:50] Tennessee. He's always he I always ask
[22:52] him to come and already ask him for next
[22:54] year in January if we're still here
[22:56] because I believe that he is one of the
[22:58] most humble men I've ever met and he has
[23:01] a testimony and the Lord has used him. I
[23:04] told him you know he was in the
[23:05] operating room for about 15 years um
[23:08] there in in Tennessee and and I told him
[23:11] I said you probably helped more people
[23:14] out of the operating room than you ever
[23:16] helped in the operating room those 15
[23:18] years. And he told me a couple of
[23:20] testimonies. One for sure that that God
[23:22] moved on somebody. If if I'm operated
[23:25] on, I want some holy hands around there
[23:27] somewhere.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Daryl was there and he he
[23:30] prayed for this one man that they the
[23:32] doctor pronounced him he was not going
[23:33] to live. He was going to die. And God
[23:37] just give him 10 more years.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; 10 years.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; 10 more years. [applause]
[23:42] The doctor said he'll never survive.
[23:45] He'll never make it. But he did. But he
[23:48] just didn't that position didn't know
[23:49] the great physician,
[23:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was practicing and the God we got
[23:53] don't practice. He does what he said
[23:55] he'd do. So let's sing as we have our
[23:57] brother come, brother Daryl Warden from
[23:59] Johnson City, Tennessee, and speak for
[24:01] us today.
[24:05] Long reserve [singing]
[24:07] for our walk
[24:10] in this world.
[24:13] They resound
[24:15] with God's own [singing and music]
[24:16] heart.
[24:17] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[24:21] [singing and music]
[24:23] Words of life,
[24:26] words of hope
[24:28] gives us strength [music] and helps us
[24:31] cope.
[24:33] In this world, [music]
[24:36] wherever we roll, the word of God will
[24:40] guide [singing] us home.
[24:43] [music] Word of God, ever true, never
[24:46] failure,
[24:48] changing [music] me and changing you.
[24:53] And we have come
[24:56] with open hearts.
[24:58] Let the word of God [singing] impart
[25:03] and [music] holy works
[25:06] of our faith
[25:08] is handed down
[25:11] to this age. Great warriors brought you
[25:14] the word [music]
[25:16] through sacrifice.
[25:18] Oh he the [singing] faithful work of
[25:22] Christ.
[25:24] Holy word, [music] long [singing] brings
[25:27] everything
[25:29] for our
[25:31] in this world.
[25:34] We resound [music]
[25:36] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[25:40] of God.
[25:42] [music]
[25:44] Words of God,
[25:46] ever true
[25:49] changing me and changing you.
[25:54] We have come [music] with open hearts.
[25:58] Oh, let the word of [music and singing]
[26:00] God.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; To me, that's the key is to come with an
[26:11] open heart.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we sing that song, Fill
[26:16] My Cup. But I believe if we had a real
[26:19] revelation of how the Lord wanted to
[26:21] bless us, we would sing Fill My Truck.
[26:23] [laughter]
[26:25] [applause]
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet said he
[26:32] wants to give you the Holy Ghost even
[26:34] more than you want to receive it.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; The love of God, how rich, how pure.
[26:39] Yes,
[26:39] &gt;&gt; sir. I was thinking as singing that song
[26:42] of way up in the cold country of Alaska,
[26:44] the little Eskimo village of Chivac.
[26:47] They was singing that song. It just took
[26:49] me back there for a minute there.
[26:51] Precious people back up there about 150
[26:53] mile below the Arctic Circle.
[26:56] No red lights, no cars, just snowmobiles
[26:59] and four-wheelers, but they love the
[27:01] Lord just as much as you do.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We greet you in the
[27:05] name of the Lord Jesus and count it an
[27:07] honor to be with you once again and
[27:08] certainly enjoyed the song service and
[27:10] the fellowship and appreciate the food
[27:12] yesterday and all the hands provided. It
[27:13] was just it was just wonderful to see
[27:16] some brother Mike Hannis and some of
[27:18] those folks. It was just really such a
[27:19] good time and
[27:20] &gt;&gt; thank you for allowing us to come.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning,
[27:23] turn with us to the book of Mark. We
[27:25] want to read from Mark chapter 14 at
[27:27] verse 36. And I bring you greetings from
[27:29] my pastor, brother Donnie Reagan. Told
[27:31] me to tell you all hello and bring
[27:32] greetings to you from my family.
[27:34] and we just count it an honor to be here
[27:36] and with you today.
[27:41] Mark chapter 14 verse 36. [snorts]
[27:53] The Bible says this.
[27:56] And he said, "Aba Father,
[27:59] &gt;&gt; all things are possible unto thee."
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. take away this cup from me.
[28:05] Nevertheless, not what I will,
[28:08] &gt;&gt; but what thou wilt.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; And he cometh and findeth them sleeping,
[28:13] and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest
[28:16] thou?
[28:18] Couldest thou not watch one hour?
[28:22] Watch ye and pray, least ye enter into
[28:24] temptation.
[28:26] The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh
[28:29] is weak. And again he went away and
[28:32] prayed and spake the same words.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; And when he returned,
[28:37] he found them asleep again, for their
[28:40] eyes were heavy, neither witch day what
[28:42] to answer him. And he cometh the third
[28:45] time, and saith unto them, sleep on now.
[28:49] Take your rest. It is enough. The hour
[28:53] is come. Behold, the Son of Man is
[28:56] betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[29:00] Rise up, let us go. Lo, he that
[29:04] betrayeth me is at hand. Let's bow our
[29:08] heads. I want to speak to this morning
[29:10] for just a few minutes on the season of
[29:14] recognition.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Or the hour is come.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[29:21] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord for all that you've done
[29:23] for us. Bless your children today Lord
[29:26] as we surrender this congregation and
[29:28] oursel into your hands for your glory in
[29:31] Jesus name. God bless you. You may be
[29:33] seated.
[29:37] Go with me this morning for just a
[29:40] minute.
[29:42] We take this little trip. We find oursel
[29:45] in a garden
[29:48] and we see
[29:51] a man kneeling,
[29:53] crying out and we notice that he's
[29:57] shaken
[29:59] &gt;&gt; and afraid.
[30:02] And we know that the Bible teaches us
[30:04] that this man went a stone throw away
[30:06] from his friends to pray
[30:10] because he needed to be alone. And yet
[30:13] he didn't want to be alone.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; For it was his hour of rrestling out his
[30:19] will.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that he prayed
[30:22] earnestly
[30:24] that if there should be a way that the
[30:26] cup could pass from him. And we can
[30:30] almost hear him as he's crying out
[30:32] saying, "Father,
[30:34] all things are possible.
[30:37] You can do anything. Don't make me drink
[30:41] this cup.
[30:47] And he gets up and he goes back and he
[30:50] finds his disciples sleeping and he
[30:52] says, "Wake up. Pray with me."
[30:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; "Would you just pray with me?" And he
[30:58] goes back and the Bible says that being
[31:01] in agony, he prayed more earnestly.
[31:04] And this sweat, as it were, great drops
[31:06] of blood fall into the ground.
[31:09] And we see him in his flesh, in his
[31:12] shaken, and in his fear, and in his
[31:14] rrestle. And you said Jesus afraid.
[31:18] Well, the Bible says, "Who in the days
[31:20] of his flesh, when he had offered up
[31:22] prayers and supplications with strong
[31:24] crying and tears unto him who was able
[31:27] to save him from death,
[31:30] &gt;&gt; and was heard in that he feared,
[31:34] &gt;&gt; and he prayed more earnestly, as it
[31:35] were, as sweat, were great drops of
[31:37] blood falling to the ground." Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Now there is a medical condition called
[31:42] hematradosis.
[31:44] And hematidosis is a rare medical
[31:46] condition where the sweat glands that
[31:48] contain the capillaries that feed the
[31:50] sweat glands, they rupture and seep into
[31:53] the sweat glands and they actually sweat
[31:56] blood.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; It can be triggered by extreme physical
[32:00] and emotional anguish.
[32:04] And he comes back to find Peter and him
[32:06] sleeping. And he says, "Peter, wake up,
[32:09] Peter.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Could you not watch with me one hour?"
[32:14] &gt;&gt; And Peter, I could just see him as he he
[32:16] wakes up and he maybe rubbing his eyes.
[32:19] He says, "Master, is a what's the
[32:21] matter? You're shaking?
[32:24] Is that is that blood on you? Are you
[32:26] bleeding?"
[32:28] He said, "Peter, watch with me. Help me
[32:32] pray. said, 'Lord,
[32:35] what what shall I pray?
[32:38] And the Bible says he comes back a third
[32:40] time. And when he comes back the third
[32:43] time, he said unto them, "Sleep on and
[32:46] take your rest. It's enough. The hour is
[32:49] come.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Behold, he, the son of man, is betrayed
[32:52] into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let
[32:55] us go. Lo, he that betrayeth me is at
[32:58] hand." Now the hour had come. The hour
[33:01] denotes a certain definite time or
[33:04] season. And Jesus was saying here
[33:07] speaking he said father the time has
[33:09] come. Now the prophet said there's
[33:11] seasons for everything. Do you believe
[33:13] that you sew in a certain season and you
[33:15] reap in a certain season and there's
[33:17] seasons when the time comes that's right
[33:20] for things to happen. He said do you
[33:22] believe that? See see certain seasons
[33:25] bring certain responses. Yes.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Watermelon and picnics in the summer cuz
[33:31] it's the season.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Is that [laughter] right?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Hot chocolate and vegetable soup
[33:36] &gt;&gt; in the winter
[33:38] &gt;&gt; because it's the season for it. And each
[33:41] season carries its anointing.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Each season carries its anointing.
[33:47] There's things that God has promised for
[33:49] this age that would happen. And there's
[33:51] a people on the earth now whose very
[33:54] purpose for being here is to fulfill
[33:56] these promises.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; For this cause was they born. You were
[34:01] born for a purpose. The season of these
[34:03] things to happen is here. The hour has
[34:06] come.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus was praying to the father. He
[34:09] acknowledged that he is aware that this
[34:10] is his time. All the preparation, the
[34:13] first two pulls of his ministry, all the
[34:16] fishes and the loaves and the miracles
[34:17] was to get the people's attention to a
[34:20] vindicate who he was. It had come down
[34:22] to this very hour. The hour is come.
[34:26] Jesus coming down to the end of his
[34:28] ministry and his very purpose for being
[34:31] on the earth. The hour of his purpose
[34:33] had come and the words of the prophets
[34:35] would be fulfilled.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we find Jesus now in Pilate's
[34:40] hall, judgment hall, betrayed by a
[34:43] message follower
[34:46] &gt;&gt; who walked with him, who said he loved
[34:48] him, who was a part of the message. Now
[34:50] all of a sudden, he forsakes the message
[34:53] and betrays the messenger.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my God,
[34:58] &gt;&gt; where are we at?
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Judas sold him out for 30 pieces of
[35:04] silver.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Today, they sell him out for an internet
[35:06] spot.
[35:08] Come on, somebody.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Pilate said unto him, "Art thou a king
[35:13] then?" And Jesus answered, "Thou sayest,
[35:15] I a king. To this end was I born. For
[35:19] this cause came I into the world, that I
[35:22] should bear witness unto the truth, and
[35:24] everyone that is of the truth
[35:26] &gt;&gt; heareth my voice."
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; That ought to make you shout this
[35:30] morning. Everyone that is of the truth
[35:33] heareth my voice.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; The hour has come. the season, the words
[35:37] that the prophet has spoke has come into
[35:39] manifestation in Pilate's judgment hall.
[35:42] They said, "Pilate, this man claims to
[35:44] be the son of God."
[35:47] &gt;&gt; When Pilate therefore heard that saying,
[35:48] he was more afraid. And he went again
[35:50] into the judgment hall and said unto
[35:51] Jesus, "Whence art thou?" But Jesus gave
[35:54] him no answer.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; He stood before Pilate, and Pilate said,
[35:58] "What is truth?" Think about this. He
[36:01] said, "Pilate standing there. Jesus
[36:03] standing there." And Pilate says, "What
[36:05] is truth?" And truth was standing right
[36:08] before him
[36:09] &gt;&gt; and he didn't recognize it. And we're
[36:11] living in the same era where people are
[36:14] today are saying, "What is truth?"
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Because of all the AI and the things
[36:18] people don't even know what to believe.
[36:20] We've made full circle. We're back here
[36:22] again.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; And truth is standing before this nation
[36:25] and they've rejected it.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] Amen. Then said Pilate unto him, Speakst
[36:34] thou not unto me? Knowest thou not I
[36:36] have power to crucify thee, and I have
[36:38] power to release thee? And Jesus
[36:40] answered, Thou couldst have no power at
[36:42] all against me, except it were given
[36:44] thee from above.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he that deliverth me unto
[36:48] thee hath the greater sin.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; The hour has come for the fulfillment of
[36:52] the prophecy. God's word will not return
[36:55] unto him void.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[36:58] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. [applause] Then if God said
[37:00] there'll be a rapture, there'll be a
[37:02] rapture. If the God said our bodies will
[37:04] be changed in a moment, in a twinkle of
[37:05] an eye, that's the way it'll be. Amen.
[37:07] The word will not return unto him void,
[37:10] &gt;&gt; but it will accomplish that which it was
[37:11] sent to do. And no one can stop it. Oh,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Nobody can, no government,
[37:18] no nation, no war, no nuclear weapon can
[37:20] stop God from fulfilling his word.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. No one can stop it. Jesus
[37:27] recognized his hour. said, "The hour has
[37:29] come." The hour has come.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Came time for Noah to go into the ark.
[37:35] Look, Noah could not have gone into the
[37:36] ark before God was ready for him to go.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet said God would not
[37:42] be a just God to send someone to
[37:44] judgment that was just. And Noah, oh,
[37:48] don't miss this. Noah was the
[37:50] preparation before judgment.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his
[37:56] message. Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Just think about it for a minute. If
[38:00] this congregation right here was the
[38:02] days of Noah, do you realize only eight
[38:05] of us would went into that boat?
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Think about that. What a small minority.
[38:15] If this was the days of Noah, only eight
[38:18] in this room would have got into that
[38:20] boat.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Would you have got in it,
[38:22] &gt;&gt; brother?
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Huh? Yes.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Would you have got in the boat? Only
[38:27] eight souls did.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; But in order to get into the boat, you
[38:31] would have had to one to believe he was
[38:34] a prophet against all those who said he
[38:36] was false.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; You had to believe that his message was
[38:41] from God, regardless of how simple it
[38:44] was.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Three, you had to go against all the
[38:47] internet and the science in that day
[38:50] &gt;&gt; that said that it's it's not going to
[38:51] rain. There's nothing up there for it to
[38:53] rain. He's nothing but a liar.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; But I tell you this morning, if you
[38:58] could see your day, hallelujah, you
[39:01] would have seen his day.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the same God that revealed it
[39:06] to Noah has revealed our day to us.
[39:09] Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the season came for Noah to
[39:13] go into the ark, God shut the door
[39:14] behind Noah.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Noah didn't shut the door. God
[39:18] did. And all opportunity for anyone else
[39:21] to ever enter was gone because God had
[39:24] closed the door. Amen. The hour had
[39:27] come. The season was right. Amen. Noah's
[39:30] message was the preparation for escape.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Can you just imagine? Look at just a
[39:36] moment. God was preparing. Noah's
[39:39] preaching. And the first thing you know,
[39:40] while one day there come a thunder, a
[39:43] blast and I see the first lightning come
[39:46] up and flash across the sky. The season
[39:48] of fulfillment had come. The hour had
[39:50] come for Noah to go into the ark. He
[39:53] began to fill the pool.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; And Noah said, "Come on, honey." Boy
[39:57] said to the wives, "Come on, honey." And
[39:59] they got into the ark. And the people
[40:00] said, "I wonder what happened."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; A blast went off somewhere. It must have
[40:05] been a rocket or something.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; A blast went off somewhere and a cloud
[40:09] began to rise. What was it? A sign that
[40:12] the hour is come. The fulfillment of the
[40:14] prophet's message. Amen.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Noah's message was the preparation for
[40:18] the escape. And with the blast of
[40:20] thunder and the rising of a supernatural
[40:23] cloud
[40:24] &gt;&gt; was the evidence that the message was
[40:26] ripe. There was a blast followed by a
[40:29] cloud and the cloud was the sign.
[40:32] Behold, the rain cometh.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Elijah, think about this. It had not
[40:41] rained for three and a half years of a
[40:44] drought. He was in the land and up on a
[40:47] mountain
[40:48] praying six times he sent Gahesa.
[40:52] Nothing. There's nothing out there.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; The seventh time he [snorts] sent
[40:56] Gahesa. And Gahesa come back. He said,
[40:59] "I see a cloud the size of a man's hand.
[41:03] Right?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; In a hot, dry climate where there had
[41:07] been no rain for three and a half years,
[41:10] &gt;&gt; a cloud that small would have just
[41:13] vapored away.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; But why didn't it? Because it was a
[41:18] supernatural cloud.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; And it testified. What did that cloud
[41:23] testify of? An abundance of rain was
[41:26] coming.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; The hour had come. The rain was going to
[41:29] fall. God vindicated his prophet. The
[41:32] cloud was the recognition that the rain
[41:35] was coming.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they got into the ark
[41:40] and God shut the door. And all those who
[41:42] laughed at him and mocked at him, all of
[41:44] the sudden the rain begin to fall. But
[41:46] it was too late.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; And I can hear him cry out, "Oh, Noah.
[41:50] Noah, we was just aggravating you,
[41:51] buddy. Please let us in. Let us in.
[41:54] Noah, open the door. For God's sake,
[41:57] Noah, if you don't take me, take my
[41:59] baby. Don't let my baby perish. Let me
[42:02] in. Let me in. But you see, Noah could
[42:04] not open the door cuz he never shut it.
[42:06] Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; And I tell you young people, I tell you,
[42:09] brother, sister, if you feel that pull
[42:11] today and you're not where you need to
[42:12] be, get inside the ark of safety.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity to escape
[42:22] this unto generation. Amen. That's
[42:23] right. [sighs]
[42:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet told the story of the son of
[42:27] man who owned the company, the meat
[42:29] packing company of Chicago. And he went
[42:31] out west to a ranch to find a bride. And
[42:34] he asked this little girl if she would
[42:37] marry him. And she said yes.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's got to be more than a
[42:44] nod. You've got to make your voice
[42:45] heard. You've got to identify your voice
[42:48] with this message. And the best way to
[42:50] do it is with an amen and a hallelujah.
[42:52] I believe it, Lord.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; He asked her, "Will you marry me?" She
[42:56] said, "Yes." And he promised her he
[42:58] would come back for her at a certain
[43:00] time for her to be ready.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. As the season
[43:06] approached, all that time after he left,
[43:08] she was among all these other ranch
[43:10] workers and all these other people. But
[43:13] all of a sudden, when the season was
[43:15] right, she goes into a little room
[43:20] &gt;&gt; and puts on a wedding garment.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Not one person of that ranch helped her.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; N
[43:30] &gt;&gt; you see, she made
[43:32] herself
[43:34] &gt;&gt; ready.
[43:36] Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And she came out no longer identify as a
[43:40] as a dishwash lady. Right?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; She came out identified as a bride. And
[43:45] as she began to identify and express who
[43:48] she was, that's when the critics
[43:51] started.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Are you hearing me, friends? Do
[43:54] you not see where we're at?
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. She made herself ready. And the
[44:00] first thing you know, what did they do?
[44:01] They got around her, be to dance and
[44:04] sing songs and make fun of her
[44:08] [sighs]
[44:10] &gt;&gt; and made out like they were the bride,
[44:12] pretending to be a bride. But it all the
[44:15] critics, all the harassment, all the
[44:17] things that they posted on the internet,
[44:19] it did not bother her.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; She was certain, amen, that the promise
[44:25] that he had gave her was true.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Her eyes wouldn't critics. Her eyes was
[44:31] on [screaming] the promise.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What are you looking at
[44:36] this morning? Don't look at the critics.
[44:38] Look at what he said. Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; She watched that little old clock tick
[44:43] up and the first thing you know it was
[44:44] about one minute. Oh, I saw the other
[44:47] day that that doomsday clock, I forget
[44:49] how many seconds they said it was 45,
[44:51] 50, something like that, seconds from
[44:53] destruction. The old clock is ticking
[44:55] right up. And she was watching that
[44:57] clock in about 1 minute.
[45:01] Oh my. And someone said, "I thought he
[45:04] was coming.
[45:06] He's supposed to be here at a such and
[45:07] such time.
[45:10] Don't worry. He'll be here."
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; That's all I want to know. He promised
[45:14] he'd be here. That's all I want to know.
[45:16] He's coming. That's all. When I don't
[45:17] know, but I'll be ready when he comes.
[45:20] I've got the wedding garment on.
[45:22] [snorts]
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've dressed myself in the
[45:26] revealed word of the hour. Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; The hour has come for his return. The
[45:31] season is right. The promise isn't true.
[45:33] Amen. And right while they were making
[45:35] the most fun. While they were making the
[45:38] most fun and all these different things
[45:40] about her and teasing her and making fun
[45:42] of her and everything, they heard the
[45:44] wheels are coming and the horse hoofs
[45:46] are beating and the old grind of the
[45:48] sand under the bookboard and she broke
[45:50] through those lines and out into the
[45:51] yard she went. Who was it? There he was
[45:54] dressed.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The carriage was ready. And
[45:58] he grabbed her into his arms and put her
[46:00] up on the bookboard and turned the
[46:01] carriage to Chicago.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; I'll come for you. He promised her. And
[46:05] when you see this happening, get ready.
[46:08] The hour has come.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; The pool
[46:12] &gt;&gt; is at hand.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in John 16:21, "A woman
[46:16] when she is in travail have sorrow
[46:19] because her hour has come. But as soon
[46:22] as she's delivered of the child, she
[46:24] remembers no more the anguish
[46:26] &gt;&gt; for joy that a man is born into the
[46:29] world. A woman knows when it's her hour,
[46:32] not the neighbors,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; not the neighbor's time, not someone
[46:36] else's time, but that birth pain strikes
[46:39] her. She recognizes it
[46:42] &gt;&gt; that the hour, her hour
[46:44] &gt;&gt; has come.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; We have at home a program called Ask a
[46:50] Nurse. My wife is a registered nurse,
[46:52] surgical nurse, and she was pregnant
[46:54] with Jessica, our first child. We, well,
[46:56] we actually lost our first child, but
[46:57] Jessica, our second child, and she was
[46:59] pregnant with Jessica, and it was on a
[47:01] Saturday morning, and I was going to go
[47:02] down in the backyard and cut some trees.
[47:04] And Cheryl came out on the back porch.
[47:06] And she said, "Honey," I said, "Yes."
[47:08] She said, "It's time. I I need to go."
[47:12] And I said, "Are you sure?" I said,
[47:14] "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse
[47:15] because you can call them and ask them,
[47:17] you know, and they'll tell you whether
[47:18] you should come in or not." I said,
[47:19] "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse." And
[47:21] my wife, God bless her heart, just as
[47:24] calm, she goes, "But I am a nurse."
[47:27] [applause and cheering]
[47:30] I said, "Oh yeah, I'll get the bag."
[47:33] [laughter]
[47:37] [laughter]
[47:38] Oh my, you got to love your wife, you
[47:40] know.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; But it was her hour. the the recognition
[47:45] that our hour has come. The season of
[47:47] fulfillment had come and Jessica was
[47:49] born.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Saints, the hour's come. Are you ready?
[47:54] Are you feeling the bull, the birth
[47:56] pain? Do you feel that pull? We've can
[47:58] pass this mountain long enough. Turn ye
[48:01] northward. Amen.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; The hour's come. That's what the church
[48:03] is doing today. For Jesus is the word
[48:05] and he's the bridegroom and the bride is
[48:07] a part of the groom. Therefore, the word
[48:09] that is to be fulfilled in this day is
[48:11] the same word that was fulfilled in his
[48:13] day.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; It's the same word, same experience,
[48:16] same life, same word, same experience,
[48:19] same life.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; What the same mean? It means the same.
[48:23] [panting]
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Israel's in her homeland. Elijah's done
[48:27] come and gone. There's a rapture of the
[48:29] church. Amen. That is bone of his bone,
[48:31] flesh of his flesh, word of his word,
[48:33] life of his life. She will be him
[48:35] expressed. The works he does, she will
[48:38] do also.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a season of recognition. The
[48:42] hour has come. What happened? What
[48:44] happened on Sunset Peak on Sunset
[48:48] Mountain? Look it up and see Sunset Peak
[48:50] on Sunset Mountain. A blast followed by
[48:53] a cloud of seven angels vindicating that
[48:56] the message was right.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Soon cometh the real
[49:01] rain."
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Not just the rain, but the real rain.
[49:04] Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; You see why I've been so zealous of the
[49:07] kind of seed I planted for the body. The
[49:09] rain's going to fall pretty soon. I
[49:11] mean, the real rain.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; And it's got to have a seed to fall on.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; It's got to have a seed to fall on. I
[49:19] hope I live to see it. Do you understand
[49:20] now? It'll be the living word. Not the
[49:23] written word, but the living word.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh and living. Amen.
[49:30] The living word as it was at the
[49:31] beginning. the spoken word of God have
[49:34] his power for it is in him.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; His own body working his own way.
[49:40] Looking to the promises that God gave
[49:42] this body.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The promises that God gave this
[49:47] body.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting and sighs]
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; You see, if you taught Methodist
[49:54] message, it wouldn't work for us. It
[49:56] takes no effect on us because this is
[49:59] not Methodist time. This is bride time.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; If Moses taught the message of Noah, it
[50:05] would take no effect. If Jesus taught
[50:06] Moses message, it would take no effect.
[50:08] The predestinated seed are laying there
[50:12] will only be watered by that type of
[50:15] water that's given
[50:17] &gt;&gt; for that seed.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; So, the anointing that falls upon the
[50:22] bride. It's not a Methodist anointing or
[50:24] a Lutheran. Come on, somebody. But it is
[50:26] an anointing. An anointing that'll fall
[50:28] upon a predestinated seed. And the seed
[50:30] of the anointing will match. And what
[50:32] will it do? But it'll bring forth fruit
[50:34] for his kingdom. Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; A tree is known by its fruit.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; The beauty of a tree is not the branch.
[50:45] It's the fruit.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's given for that seed. It won't
[50:52] grow under any condition. It must be the
[50:54] condition that grows it. And when you
[50:56] see the church getting worldly like it
[50:58] was in the days of Sodom,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; you know, like when they're now in the
[51:02] church world today,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; they're allowing trans v.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; They're wearing transsexuals to preach
[51:09] the gospel.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; They're having they're having men
[51:15] dressed like women teaching Sunday
[51:17] school
[51:18] &gt;&gt; as it was in the days of Sodom. So is it
[51:20] in this day. But ain't it something? All
[51:23] of a sudden, everybody's talking about
[51:25] trans. A change from one to another.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; If the world's looking at a trans, I'm
[51:30] looking at a trans, too.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not changing to a woman, but
[51:35] changing. Oh, hallelujah. Changing into
[51:37] that image God had of me before the
[51:39] foundation of the world. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Sodom, see the world all
[51:47] going into worship the God of this evil
[51:48] age. and seeing that and seeing a little
[51:51] minority group gathered under the
[51:53] inspiration of God producing again
[51:57] &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus Christ.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; You see, if a farmer goes and plants his
[52:01] seed and covers it up, he must let that
[52:04] seed go through the full cycle of
[52:06] growth,
[52:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Because if he harvestes it any other
[52:11] time prior to the maturity of that seed,
[52:14] &gt;&gt; he can never have another crop. So he
[52:16] must wait till that seed comes to
[52:18] maturity before he harvestes it. And
[52:21] once it comes to maturity, he can take
[52:23] that seed because that seed has the
[52:25] ability to reproduce itself again. And
[52:27] when will Christ take his church when
[52:29] she has the ability to reproduce him
[52:33] again on the earth, making the
[52:35] bridegroom and the bride the same.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we just came through
[52:42] Christmas with three planets lined up.
[52:44] It made the announcement of the
[52:46] bridegroom on the earth,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Christ on the earth.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; But what did the prophet say? I believe
[52:50] it was 1964. I believe it was that five
[52:53] planets lined up. And what did the
[52:55] prophet say? It was the announcement of
[52:57] the bride on the earth in infancy.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; But a man don't marry a baby, but he
[53:02] must wait till she comes into her
[53:04] season. The hour has come for her season
[53:07] of love. And when she enters that season
[53:09] of love, she can reproduce him again.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh, God. I see it, but I
[53:16] want to see it more, Lord.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[53:20] Producing again the life of Jesus Christ
[53:22] by the scriptures that's supposed to
[53:24] happen. You know what hour that you're
[53:26] living in. The Bible fortell by
[53:28] prophecy,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; what day that we're living and what time
[53:31] we're living and what kind of events
[53:33] ought to be taking place. It foretells
[53:35] it exactly to the letter.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:39] Huh? Ain't it something that all of a
[53:41] sudden our government is now
[53:43] investigating UFOs after all these years
[53:46] of people seeing UFO sightings and now
[53:49] our government is trying to figure out
[53:51] what they are? Well, they could come and
[53:52] ask us. We'd have saved them a lot of
[53:54] money because we had a prophet to tell
[53:56] us that they were investigating angels.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said one day they'll
[54:00] drop down and when they go, you'll go
[54:02] with them. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; You see the hour that we're living in,
[54:06] friends. Amen. And it'll not miss one
[54:09] age. Not one time. It fortells exactly
[54:11] to the letter. Has never missed one age
[54:12] all the time. Not one time has it ever
[54:14] missed and it won't. For who are
[54:17] predestinated to see it?
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Will see it. Jesus said, "No man can
[54:21] come to me except my father draws him
[54:24] first, and all that my father hath given
[54:27] me will come."
[54:30] &gt;&gt; It's the word joining the word. The word
[54:33] joining with the word. It can do nothing
[54:35] else. We know it. The day that we're
[54:37] living in, the hour has come. The season
[54:41] of recognition
[54:42] [gasps]
[54:43] of who I am.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Who I am. Who am I? I'm not a church
[54:47] member.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not just a message follower. Don't
[54:50] misunderstand me.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; But more than that,
[54:53] &gt;&gt; the word becoming flesh, the promised
[54:55] word for this day,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; being watered by an anointing to bring
[55:01] forth that seed to do what? To
[55:03] reproduce. Not another church, not
[55:05] another organization, but to reproduce
[55:08] Christ.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "A little while the world will
[55:11] see me no more, but ye shall see me."
[55:14] How, Lord? How? For I'll be with you,
[55:17] &gt;&gt; even
[55:18] &gt;&gt; in you. [panting and sighs]
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the same time, the bride has
[55:23] recognized the evening light has just
[55:25] began to recognize the hungry
[55:26] Pentecostals have began to recognize
[55:28] them organizations hasn't got it. And
[55:30] the things they're looking for, they're
[55:31] so twisted and torup. It's the time of
[55:34] recognition. Recognition. You've got to
[55:36] recognize. The world has recognized. The
[55:39] nations has recognized. Science has
[55:41] recognized. The devil has recognized
[55:43] it's a time he can wreck havoc on women,
[55:45] wreck the church, wreck the people. He's
[55:47] recognized it. [snorts]
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And God has recognized that there's a
[55:52] people on the earth that he
[55:54] predestinated to life. He's recognized
[55:56] it's the time to send his message. And
[56:00] he's did it. The people has recognized
[56:02] it. The bright time has realized the
[56:04] evening light.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet said, "The word
[56:08] manifested for that hour is the light of
[56:10] that hour."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. The word
[56:14] manifested for that hour is the light of
[56:16] that hour.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Then the evening light, the evening
[56:20] light is just not the name of the
[56:22] church.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; The evening light is you.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the light of the
[56:29] world." And then he said, "You're the
[56:31] light of the world."
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting and sighs]
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:26, "Even the mystery
[56:38] [snorts]
[56:39] which has been hidden from ages and from
[56:42] generations, but now he may has made
[56:46] manifest to his saints,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest to his saints."
[56:51] It denotes a set time or a season like
[56:54] the song Amazing Grace. I once was lost,
[56:58] but now
[56:59] &gt;&gt; I'm found.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known. To whom
[57:04] God would make known. To whom God would
[57:07] make known what is the riches of the
[57:09] glory of this mystery among the
[57:11] Gentiles.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Uh that'd be us.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Which is Christ in you.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The hope.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Of glory.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; The action. You see the action of the
[57:24] mystery unfolding. It's causing a
[57:27] reaction
[57:27] &gt;&gt; to those it's unfolding to.
[57:31] [gasps]
[57:34] &gt;&gt; It's causing a reaction.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; The mystery unfolding is causing a
[57:39] reaction to those that's unfolding to.
[57:41] Paul is telling us here in the book of
[57:42] Colossians that God had this great
[57:45] mystery hid from ages and from
[57:48] generations
[57:49] &gt;&gt; until a set season or a time
[57:52] &gt;&gt; that he would make the mystery known.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Now why after ages and generations would
[57:59] all of a sudden this mystery that God
[58:01] kept in himself, why would all of a
[58:03] sudden
[58:04] &gt;&gt; he would want it to be made known? Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; The mystery, this mystery that he would
[58:12] make it known at a set season or a set
[58:14] time. I say to you this morning that
[58:16] this is the time
[58:19] &gt;&gt; when the time comes to make known that
[58:21] this hidden mystery when it comes time
[58:23] to be made known. How would he do it?
[58:25] How would he make this mystery known?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Paul tells us in Ephesians 3:3 how that
[58:30] by revelation,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:33] By revelation he made known unto me the
[58:35] mystery as I wrote a four in few words.
[58:37] Revelation it equals manifestation. The
[58:40] prophet of God said God does it and then
[58:42] he reveals it.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; He makes the mystery known by
[58:46] revelation. It equals manifestation. The
[58:49] manifestation of the bride is the
[58:51] evidence that the mystery has been
[58:52] released.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's secret mystery that he had
[58:58] before the world began. Now in the back
[59:00] part of God's mind, we said it
[59:02] yesterday. This mystery laid in the back
[59:04] of God's mind,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; something that he was trying, he was
[59:08] going to achieve. He had a motive in
[59:10] doing it. God just don't do something
[59:11] just to do it. Everything he does is for
[59:13] a purpose.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing it. In order to
[59:17] do what? In order to let himself be
[59:20] expressed.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; God had this secret in his mind. Nobody
[59:23] knew nothing about it. For who had
[59:25] access to God's mind? He allowed Moses
[59:27] to go back to the beginning. That was as
[59:29] far as Moses could go.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; But think of it. Oh God, think of it. In
[59:34] this hour that we're living in, he
[59:36] allowed the prophet of Malachi 45 and
[59:39] six to go into the back part of God's
[59:42] mind
[59:43] &gt;&gt; to catch this secret and to reveal it to
[59:46] his bride.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Now, why would God suddenly want this
[59:51] secret to be made known? A secret that
[59:53] he had kept down through the ages and
[59:55] generations. There must be somebody on
[59:58] the earth now who can receive it. A
[1:00:01] predestinated chosen body of people on
[1:00:04] the earth that knows what he wants done
[1:00:06] with his word. For the prophet says
[1:00:08] shall have thus sayaith the Lord
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; or keep still.
[1:00:13] [sighs and panting]
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When a son of God by faith
[1:00:18] takes the word of God into his heart and
[1:00:20] speaks it back up on his lips, it's just
[1:00:23] the same as deity speaking.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You know, we just came through Christmas
[1:00:30] and I don't know how many manger scenes
[1:00:31] I passed with Jesus in a baby in a
[1:00:34] manger. You've seen them. But you know,
[1:00:37] today, if you really want to do an
[1:00:39] accurate portrayal of where Christ was,
[1:00:41] you'd have to go out and lay in the yard
[1:00:42] yourself.
[1:00:45] [panting]
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. A predestinated chosen body of
[1:00:58] people on the earth that knows what he
[1:01:00] wants done with his word. Not God above
[1:01:02] us. Not just God with us, but God in us,
[1:01:05] the hope of glory. Christ in you, Christ
[1:01:08] in me, the hope of glory.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this, "What
[1:01:14] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:01:16] idols?"
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; The temple of God, the temp, you know,
[1:01:20] the dwelling place of God. Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; What agreement hath the dwelling place
[1:01:24] of God with idols? For ye are the temple
[1:01:27] of the living God,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; as God hath said, I will dwell in them
[1:01:32] and walk in them, and I will be their
[1:01:34] God, and they shall be my people. Notice
[1:01:37] that God's desire is not just to be with
[1:01:40] his people. But he wants to be in his
[1:01:42] people.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; For he said, I will not dwell with them,
[1:01:45] but I will dwell in them. And I will not
[1:01:47] walk with them, but I will walk in them.
[1:01:50] Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; God the creator walking in his creation.
[1:01:59] [panting and gasps]
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You didn't stagger into this message,
[1:02:04] friends. God predestinated you
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; for this time. The hour has come. The
[1:02:09] season
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; of recognition.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; This season, this hour, this time, bride
[1:02:14] time.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet never even said bride time
[1:02:17] to the later part of 60s. 64 I believe
[1:02:20] it was something like that the middle of
[1:02:21] ' 64 that he started talking about a
[1:02:23] bride time.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; God wanted to express himself in a body
[1:02:28] of believers called the bride.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; The the manifested Christ in you.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. The great manifested
[1:02:40] God in Christ. Now Christ manifested in
[1:02:43] you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] Look, what was once God's great secret,
[1:02:48] God's great mysterious secret in his
[1:02:50] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:02:54] believers. That is the body of Christ.
[1:02:57] What was God's once great secret in his
[1:03:00] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:03:02] is now made manifest. Now, where where
[1:03:05] is it made manifest? In you.
[1:03:09] [crying]
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] You remember the Welch revival? And they
[1:03:16] went over to find out this revival, to
[1:03:18] find out what's going on. And they saw a
[1:03:20] policeman standing on the street corner
[1:03:22] and they went to that policeman to find
[1:03:24] out where the Welch revival was. Now, I
[1:03:26] want you to understand, they didn't go
[1:03:27] to the policeman and ask directions
[1:03:29] because he was a policeman.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And when they went to him and said,
[1:03:33] "Sir, where is the Welch Revival?" He
[1:03:35] never said, "Go two blocks, turn right,
[1:03:37] turn left, there's a library. Behind the
[1:03:38] library, there's a storefront. That's
[1:03:40] where you'll find it." He never gave
[1:03:41] them a GPS location.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; But when they said, "Sir, we're hungry.
[1:03:47] Where is the Welch Revival?" You know
[1:03:49] what he said? You're looking at it.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Now, why did they go to him? Not because
[1:03:56] he is a policeman, but he was standing
[1:03:57] on the street corner singing a gospel
[1:04:00] song.
[1:04:02] [sighs]
[1:04:02] [gasps]
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't talking about the
[1:04:04] revival. He was manifesting the revival.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's not enough to talk
[1:04:11] about the token. You must now apply the
[1:04:13] token.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] Amen. Oh, do you love him?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Where is it made manifest? In his bride.
[1:04:25] Then God would manifest in one man. God
[1:04:28] would manifest in one man. Now he's
[1:04:30] manifested in an entire church universal
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; all over the world. The body of Christ
[1:04:38] is represented all over the world. And
[1:04:40] what does that do? It makes St. John
[1:04:41] 14:12 and it vindicates it to be the
[1:04:43] truth. For Jesus said, "The works I do
[1:04:45] shall you do also, and greater works
[1:04:47] than this shall you do." Now, you can't
[1:04:49] do nothing greater that open blinded
[1:04:50] eyes and raised the dead. So, what was
[1:04:52] he saying? All the things that took
[1:04:54] place in Jesus day, it was in his body,
[1:04:57] one man doing these miracles. But now,
[1:04:59] it's a universal bride around the world
[1:05:01] and over in Africa and down in South
[1:05:03] Africa and down in Tennessee and here in
[1:05:05] Georgia. God is doing great things. Why?
[1:05:07] It's a universal bride. More works
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; because it's a many member bride.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And say, look, if I'm the if I'm the
[1:05:19] foot of the body of this bride, if I'm
[1:05:22] his body represent and I'm the foot, if
[1:05:25] I'm the bottom, if I where the little
[1:05:26] toe meets the foot and that if that's
[1:05:28] what I am, I'm still in the body.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [gasps]
[1:05:33] But even if that's who I am, if that's
[1:05:35] who I am in the body of Christ, every
[1:05:37] devil is still under my feet.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Lower. Lower. Stomp Satan. Lower.
[1:05:46] [applause]
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wouldn't manifest in one man.
[1:05:50] Now he's manifested in the entire church
[1:05:52] universal. Everywhere. God can work
[1:05:54] through every man and every woman
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; that'll open up their heart
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; and let the Lord Jesus come in and work
[1:06:01] his will through them.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; The days of the voice of the seventh
[1:06:06] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:06:08] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:06:11] hath declared to his servants the
[1:06:13] prophets.
[1:06:15] [panting]
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; How did he Can I have just a few more
[1:06:19] minutes? Look, how did he identify the
[1:06:22] bridegroom on the earth? He sent a
[1:06:24] messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon
[1:06:26] him.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Then how will he how will he announce
[1:06:29] the bride on the earth? It'll be a be a
[1:06:31] messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon
[1:06:33] him.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; For the same word speaks for the groom
[1:06:36] speaks also for the bride.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Look, last year we had a eclipse.
[1:06:42] Remember I think it was around April the
[1:06:43] 10th we had an eclipse and I was down in
[1:06:45] Hardy, Arkansas because that's where it
[1:06:47] was a 100%. And if you're at a 100%
[1:06:49] where the eclipse is, it's total
[1:06:50] darkness. So we preached a meeting down
[1:06:52] there and then on that Monday we stood
[1:06:54] over to watch the eclipse. And when it
[1:06:56] when that moon and that sun became one,
[1:06:58] it was total darkness where we were
[1:07:00] standing.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Turkeys begin to gobble. Roosters was
[1:07:03] roosting.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; It's the craziest thing you ever seen.
[1:07:05] You could look out on the horizon and
[1:07:07] see light, but right there where we was
[1:07:08] at was darkness.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And as I stood there, you know, you
[1:07:11] couldn't had to have these special
[1:07:12] glasses, but once the moon covered the
[1:07:14] sun, you could take the glasses off and
[1:07:15] just look at it. It was phenomenal. How
[1:07:17] many knows what I'm talking about? It
[1:07:18] came through here a few years ago. And I
[1:07:21] was standing there looking at that moon.
[1:07:23] Now, the prophet said the moon is the
[1:07:24] type of the church and the sun is the
[1:07:26] type of Christ.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I It just struck me.
[1:07:29] I got so happy that when the moon and
[1:07:31] the sun become one, there was darkness
[1:07:34] on the earth.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; When Christ and his church becomes one,
[1:07:41] it's in the Leosa age. Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; The age of gross darkness when the two
[1:07:48] become one.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; It's not something that's coming. I tell
[1:07:52] you, it's here.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:00] Amen. The mystery of God should be
[1:08:01] finished and declared to his servants,
[1:08:02] the prophets. Therefore, the entire
[1:08:04] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:08:06] in Christ. Mary was a human incubator.
[1:08:09] She carried the holy child and brought
[1:08:11] him to birth. It was a God man. He was
[1:08:13] the son of God. He was a new creation.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; He was the first of a new race.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; He is the head of the new race. Well, if
[1:08:29] there's a head, there got to be a body.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; What good's a body without a head? What
[1:08:34] good's a head without a body?
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, [laughter]
[1:08:38] help us. [gasps]
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] He's the head of a new race. And he's
[1:08:44] the head of the body of the church, who
[1:08:46] is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[1:08:48] dead, that in all things he might have
[1:08:51] the preeminence. Therefore, if any man
[1:08:54] be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old
[1:08:57] things have passed away. Behold, all
[1:08:59] things are come become new. There can
[1:09:01] see though that that the old man was of
[1:09:04] the old order of a creation. Now in
[1:09:06] union with Christ, he has become a new
[1:09:09] creation of God.
[1:09:12] You see, Satan has no ability to create.
[1:09:14] He can pervert, but he can't create.
[1:09:16] Only God can create. So, this new race
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; must come from the creator.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs and gasps]
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Created in union with Christ Jesus, unto
[1:09:28] good works, [sighs and panting]
[1:09:30] oh God. Ephesians 4:24. and that ye put
[1:09:33] on the new man
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; which after God is created in
[1:09:36] righteousness
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; and true holiness.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; A season when the head and the body
[1:09:45] unites.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, do you see the hours come?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; This is who we are. We've come into a
[1:09:52] new year.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of the manifestation of
[1:09:57] who we are.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to pump it up. We don't
[1:10:00] have to work it up. We just live it.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; You just live it. It'll manifest itself
[1:10:06] through you.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; A new creation, a new race.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; A God man.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said Jesus was all man. He
[1:10:18] was all God. He was a man when he wept
[1:10:20] in the garden.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But when he threw his shoulders back and
[1:10:23] said, "Lazarus, come forth." That was
[1:10:24] more than a man. That was God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; He was a man when he's sleeping on the
[1:10:28] boat, tired from preaching. But when he
[1:10:29] put his foot on the bow of the boat and
[1:10:31] said, "Peace be still." That was God in
[1:10:33] a man.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you see, my brother, my sister,
[1:10:36] that's what his desire has been all
[1:10:37] along.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; To walk in us
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; to live in us. For what is true
[1:10:44] fellowship? Two fellows
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; in the same ship.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Can you see it, my brother, my sister?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; God, help us this morning.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us this morning. And what
[1:11:00] does it take?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; What does it take for this to manifest
[1:11:03] in us? A surrendered life.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just something yielded.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Something yielded that he can work his
[1:11:12] work through. As I said yesterday, God
[1:11:15] don't need something big. He just needs
[1:11:18] something yielded.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him today?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Do you see your hour?
[1:11:29] Don't you see the critics rising up?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; It's the season for it.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Look, I I'll close with this, but look,
[1:11:35] when Jesus was here and he started his
[1:11:38] ministry, the Bible says he was
[1:11:41] glorified by all.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Is that not true?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; In three years and six months, it come
[1:11:47] from being glorified by all to the point
[1:11:49] they hated him
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; till they killed him. That's
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; right. in a short season.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; They went from loving him to hating him
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; to criticizing him to calling him a
[1:11:59] devil and a false prophet.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his
[1:12:05] message.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; But what came next? The resurrection.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. that we're living in
[1:12:13] an hour that all of a sudden I've been
[1:12:15] in this message a long time, but I have
[1:12:17] never seen this message abused and
[1:12:20] criticized
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; than it is right now.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; This believe the sign and all these
[1:12:25] things that people are doing and all
[1:12:26] this hate and all this and that if I
[1:12:28] don't know if you saw it or not, but
[1:12:29] somebody went up to brother Bram's grave
[1:12:31] and wrote all kinds of nasty words on
[1:12:32] it. Did you see that? Desseecrated his
[1:12:35] grave. It's the hour that we're living
[1:12:37] in. Don't you see the final rejection of
[1:12:39] his word is his bride? And when they
[1:12:42] reject this bride,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; what comes next?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; The rapture.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you see where we're at in time,
[1:12:50] friends? It's here. The season is here.
[1:12:52] The time has come.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; I feel the birth pains.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:13:05] people. There is nothing. There is
[1:13:07] nothing in this nation worth missing
[1:13:09] this rapture over.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; There's not enough money. There's not
[1:13:13] enough.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Get under his wings.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hide yourself under his wings. The hour
[1:13:22] has come in a little while. Oh my. Let's
[1:13:26] be ready.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; God, give me more love.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Give me more power. More of you
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; in my life. Do you love him today?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him today?
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; God sent this message to find you.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah, "They shall be
[1:13:45] called the sought out."
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; The sought out.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; We shall be called the sought out.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Who do you reckon's looking for us?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom looking for
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. [gasps] Oh, God. May the Lord
[1:14:03] bless you. Let's bow our heads.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:14:10] Oh God, how I love you, Lord. How I feel
[1:14:14] your presence on me, Lord.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] More love,
[1:14:21] more power,
[1:14:24] more of you in my life.
[1:14:30] More love. More
[1:14:33] power, [singing]
[1:14:35] more of you in my life. And I will
[1:14:40] worship you with all of my heart. And I
[1:14:44] will worship you with all of my mind.
[1:14:49] And I will worship you with all of my
[1:14:53] strength. For you are my [singing] Lord.
[1:14:58] Lord,
[1:15:01] more love,
[1:15:04] more power,
[1:15:06] more of you in my life.
[1:15:11] More love,
[1:15:14] more power,
[1:15:17] more of you in my life. And I will
[1:15:21] worship you with all of my heart. And I
[1:15:26] will worship you with all of my mind.
[1:15:31] And [singing] I will worship you with
[1:15:34] all of my strength.
[1:15:36] For you are my Lord.
[1:15:43] Oh Lord Jesus.
[1:15:45] God, it's our hunger today, God.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; We don't want the world, Lord.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; We don't want the world order. We don't
[1:15:52] want the things of the world. It's you
[1:15:54] we hunger for, Lord. That anointing,
[1:15:56] that real rain that is to fall upon us
[1:15:59] to bring forth fruit. Oh God, help us,
[1:16:02] Lord God, in this hour when everything
[1:16:05] is turning against us. Lord, yet you
[1:16:07] said, "I'll never leave thee, nor will I
[1:16:09] forsake thee." Yay, though I walk
[1:16:10] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:16:12] death, I will be with you. Oh God, we
[1:16:15] are so grateful, Lord, of this hour that
[1:16:17] these mysteries, these great things that
[1:16:19] you hid in your mind, Lord, has now been
[1:16:22] placed into our hearts that we may
[1:16:23] manifest it back upon our flesh that the
[1:16:26] world may know you're the same
[1:16:27] yesterday, today, and forever. I'm so
[1:16:29] glad my children don't have to go back
[1:16:31] to 65 and find you doing miracles and
[1:16:33] signs and wonders. But today, the hour
[1:16:35] that we're living in, my children are
[1:16:37] witness of miracles and signs and
[1:16:39] wonders and these things. Lord, we don't
[1:16:41] seek after them. We don't follow signs,
[1:16:43] but they do follow us, Lord God. And we
[1:16:46] are grateful today to be a part of the
[1:16:48] economy of God. And Lord, as we come
[1:16:50] into this new year, God, let this be the
[1:16:52] year of consecration, of more
[1:16:54] dedication, of service, Lord, to lay
[1:16:56] into your presence, to ripen in the
[1:16:58] presence of the sun. Oh God, grant it,
[1:17:00] Lord. Bless this church. Let a revival
[1:17:02] strike this church, Lord. Let it strike
[1:17:04] this little community of Lula, Lord.
[1:17:06] that'll strike this part of Georgia that
[1:17:08] that last seed can be found, Lord,
[1:17:10] because we know when that last one comes
[1:17:12] in, you'll close the book and call for
[1:17:14] your bride. Oh, Father, until then, let
[1:17:17] us labor, Lord. Oh, Father, let us
[1:17:20] labor. God, we don't have to manifest
[1:17:22] the light, but let us bear that light,
[1:17:24] Lord Jesus. Let it reflect through us,
[1:17:26] Lord, that the world may know that
[1:17:28] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:31] forever. Bless your children today,
[1:17:33] Lord. We pray [music] if you're here,
[1:17:34] friends. If that's your desire today,
[1:17:36] why don't you just lift your hands up to
[1:17:38] him and say, "Lord, Lord, this new year,
[1:17:40] God, I want to rededicate. I want to
[1:17:42] reconsecrate myself to you, Lord. Oh,
[1:17:45] Father, many walked away this year, but
[1:17:47] I'm still here, Lord. I'm still
[1:17:48] believing, oh God. I lift my heads to
[1:17:51] you, Lord, today. More love, more power,
[1:17:54] more of you in my life, oh God. That's
[1:17:56] what I need, God. That's all I need,
[1:17:58] Lord. That's all I need, Lord, is you,
[1:18:01] God. Come today, Lord. I open up my
[1:18:04] heart to you. I receive it today, Lord,
[1:18:06] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I
[1:18:09] pray for those that are afflicted today.
[1:18:11] The sick that are among us in the name
[1:18:13] of Jesus. May the anointing of God move
[1:18:15] upon them today, Lord. Let the sickness
[1:18:17] leave them. Let the affliction leave
[1:18:19] them. Let the weariness leave them. Let
[1:18:21] the oppression and the depression, let
[1:18:23] it leave them today in the name of Jesus
[1:18:25] Christ. We are not children of darkness.
[1:18:27] We are the children of light. Amen. And
[1:18:30] we are your people. You are our God.
[1:18:33] Amen. We are your people. We are your
[1:18:35] people and you are our God. And we love
[1:18:38] you, Lord. And we worship you, God. And
[1:18:41] we receive you today in the name of
[1:18:43] Jesus. Oh God, bless Brother Way, Lord.
[1:18:45] Use him, God. Use him for your glory.
[1:18:47] Anoint these other ministers here, Lord,
[1:18:49] as they travel through Central America,
[1:18:51] different parts of the world. Use them,
[1:18:53] oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus. Oh
[1:18:56] God, may we not have to point to
[1:18:58] somewhere where the revival is, but may
[1:19:01] we be like that policeman and say we are
[1:19:03] the bride's revival. Oh God, not just a
[1:19:07] rain, but the real rain. Oh God, the
[1:19:09] real rain to a vindicate that the
[1:19:12] message is right. Grant it Lord God.
[1:19:15] Grant it Lord in Jesus name we pray.
[1:19:19] Amen. Go brother sing us something
[1:19:22] brother.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. soul. Amen.

[1:20:11] minute?
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] The love [singing] of the God
[1:20:20] [music]
[1:20:22] is [singing] greater.
[1:20:28] That [music and singing] time for
[1:20:34] can [singing and music] never tell.
[1:20:40] It goes beyond
[1:20:43] [singing and music]
[1:20:45] the highest star
[1:20:51] and reaches
[1:20:53] to
[1:20:57] the [music] Lord.

[1:22:31] him.
[1:22:34] of God. [music]
[1:22:36] Love of God, how rich and pure, [music]
[1:22:44] how measureless.
[1:22:48] [music] Amen. And strong.
[1:22:54] reach out forever
[1:23:00] [music]
[1:23:00] more

[1:23:07] and a
[1:23:11] shallow.
[1:23:15] Amen. [music]
[1:23:16] Brother Joe, let's sing more of you. Can
[1:23:18] you hear more of you? We got [music]
[1:23:22] more of you. More of you. more of you.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; A second before.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:29] Uh we got more of you on the on the uh
[1:23:33] on the list.
[1:23:35] More of you. I want more of you. Is that
[1:23:38] our Is that our prayer? Is that our
[1:23:40] plea? I want more preaching like I want
[1:23:44] to hear. The only way you going to hear
[1:23:46] right there
[1:23:48] more of you today, this hour, this day
[1:23:53] is the day of salvation. This is the day
[1:23:57] that's coming. Noah was preaching 120
[1:24:00] years. And like I said the other day, he
[1:24:02] expected it to rain.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Well, his expectation came to pass.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; It did rain.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what about it, though? Only
[1:24:11] eight people went in.
[1:24:14] 120 years. Brother Daryl, sometimes we
[1:24:17] get disappointed because people don't
[1:24:20] want to hear us. What about preaching
[1:24:22] for 120 years the same message and you
[1:24:24] get no results except one day God comes
[1:24:26] on the scene and says, "Get in the ark."
[1:24:29] This is all that's going to hear me.
[1:24:31] This is it. And that's what's going to
[1:24:32] happen. When we come to this day that
[1:24:35] God's going to shut the door on the
[1:24:37] Gentile church, there'll be no one else
[1:24:39] saved. That'll be it. Whoever's in's in.
[1:24:43] Whoever's out is out. Everybody with me?
[1:24:46] Every person has got a seat on that ark.
[1:24:51] If you will
[1:24:54] expect that you have a seat on that ark,
[1:24:58] God's given us a way.
[1:25:01] And through preaching, through
[1:25:03] fellowshipping, I cannot see how
[1:25:06] somebody would sit at home and try to
[1:25:09] make have a service. I just can't see
[1:25:11] that.
[1:25:12] We are sheep. We need to be together. We
[1:25:15] need fellowship. We need to feed off
[1:25:16] each other. Everybody with me? Feed off
[1:25:20] each other. The highs, the lows, the ins
[1:25:23] and outs, the ups and downs. Sometimes,
[1:25:25] you know, you may be up and your brother
[1:25:27] and sister may be down. Or you may be
[1:25:30] down and your brother and sister may be
[1:25:31] up. Well, that's why we bind together
[1:25:34] and we bring everybody into the fold and
[1:25:37] we try our best to love God with all of
[1:25:39] our heart. [music] But you know how to
[1:25:41] love. It's just like brotherh Manuel was
[1:25:43] saying today.
[1:25:46] They asked Jesus. They said, "What's the
[1:25:48] two of the greatest commandments,
[1:25:51] right?" He said, "Love the Lord thy God
[1:25:54] with all thy heart and love thy neighbor
[1:25:57] as thyself." These are two of the
[1:25:59] greatest commandments. Why? Because if
[1:26:01] you can love your brother [music] or
[1:26:03] your neighbor as much as you do you,
[1:26:06] you're doing a good thing.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Love your neighbor
[1:26:12] just as you love yourself.
[1:26:16] That's the love of God.
[1:26:18] Can we say it now?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; What I need is more of you.
[1:26:31] I've had
[1:26:34] [music]
[1:26:35] but yet I hunger still worshiping.
[1:26:40] There's a wonderful atmosphere today.
[1:26:43] Get what you need. Get it today
[1:26:47] for more of you. You sing it to me. Let
[1:26:51] that [singing] be your desire. [music]
[1:26:53] More.
[1:26:55] Yes. More of you.
[1:26:58] I want more [singing]
[1:27:00] of you.
[1:27:03] [music]
[1:27:04] Oh, I've had it all, [singing]
[1:27:08] but what I need is more of you.
[1:27:15] [music]
[1:27:16] Hey, listen. I've had enough of this
[1:27:18] world. I've had my fill of this world. I
[1:27:22] want the heavenly things that God has
[1:27:25] got for us and to give us right now.
[1:27:29] Heavenly places
[1:27:31] while we're still standing in hell.
[1:27:33] [music]
[1:27:34] What a miracle. Sing it to him. You're a
[1:27:37] miracle where you're standing today. I
[1:27:39] want more of you.
[1:27:43] Grant it, Lord. I want [singing] more of
[1:27:47] you.
[1:27:51] I I've had it all,
[1:27:54] but what I need is more of you. [music]
[1:28:00] Oh, sing it to him. Of things I've had
[1:28:05] in my field.
[1:28:07] Oh, but yet I hunger [singing]
[1:28:11] still.
[1:28:14] Here we are, empty and bare. Lord, hear
[1:28:18] my prayer for more of you. One more
[1:28:22] time, sing it to him.
[1:28:24] I want more of you. Let that be your
[1:28:28] prayer.
[1:28:30] I want more of you. [music]
[1:28:36] Oh, I've had it all, but what I need is
[1:28:42] more of you. Yes, Lord. Amen. Grant it.
[1:28:47] of things I've had my fear.
[1:28:53] But yet I hunger still [singing]
[1:28:59] empty and bad.
[1:29:02] Lord, hear my prayer for more [singing]
[1:29:06] of you. [music]
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:11] God wants to have the preeminence. The
[1:29:13] only way you can have the preeminence is
[1:29:16] to have more of him.
[1:29:18] You [snorts] remember you know what
[1:29:19] preeminence is? Preeminence mean you put
[1:29:22] him before everything else. And that's
[1:29:26] what he that's why I want you to read
[1:29:27] Christ the mystery of God revealed. And
[1:29:29] he he quoted about three pages of it
[1:29:31] just a few minutes ago if you're
[1:29:32] realizing it. That's where he was uh he
[1:29:34] was preaching from. So, but we're going
[1:29:36] to um we're going to start there because
[1:29:39] if listen, if we don't know that it's
[1:29:40] Christ in us,
[1:29:43] you'll never know what a seal is.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; You'll be sealed out of any revelation
[1:29:48] without the seal of God in your heart.
[1:29:52] And that's just the way God works. But
[1:29:54] you know what? God said, I'm going to do
[1:29:55] it in simplicity. I'm going to let a
[1:29:58] seventh grade prophet
[1:30:00] that can't hardly speak good English.
[1:30:03] I'm going to send it through him so that
[1:30:05] every person little or big can
[1:30:08] understand what he's saying and make it
[1:30:10] so simple
[1:30:12] that even the common people. Now listen,
[1:30:15] the son of man ministry was what? Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ on earth in in human flesh. And
[1:30:20] the Bible said the common people heard
[1:30:23] him gladly.
[1:30:25] Not the hierarchy, not even the
[1:30:27] religious world. The common people heard
[1:30:30] him gladly. And that's us. We're just
[1:30:32] common people. But we got a message
[1:30:35] that's so powerful. One day it's going
[1:30:37] to absolutely change your body. And the
[1:30:40] words that you speak out of your mouth
[1:30:43] is going to raise the dead. [music]
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; The word you're going to speak. I was
[1:30:48] thinking as brother brother Daryl was
[1:30:50] was was speaking, I thought, Lord,
[1:30:52] you're in his mind and he's speaking
[1:30:55] what you told him to what you told him
[1:30:56] to speak. But it's happening in a split
[1:30:59] second.
[1:31:00] I mean, a split second.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; In the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:31:07] eye, we're going to be changed. Listen,
[1:31:10] why not start now a little bit at a
[1:31:12] time? Let's change a little bit at a
[1:31:14] time. And then one day, we're going to
[1:31:17] be changed and got and raptured out of
[1:31:18] this place.
[1:31:21] Tell Brother Daryl how much you
[1:31:22] appreciate it. Very timely message. Very
[1:31:24] wonderful message. Very timely. And we
[1:31:26] sure appreciate him. Like I said before,
[1:31:28] he he us he starts our year out.
[1:31:30] Wonderful. And just pray for him as he
[1:31:33] heads back home and and up there with
[1:31:36] brother Donnie and helps him out. Puts
[1:31:37] his shoulder to the wheel there and and
[1:31:39] uh he's been to Lord, he's been to 30
[1:31:41] something countries. I don't know if
[1:31:42] some of you know his testimony, but he
[1:31:44] went to the he got in the army to see
[1:31:46] the world and they put him in like Fort
[1:31:47] Bragg uh North Carolina or somewhere and
[1:31:50] he never got out overseas. But now since
[1:31:52] he got in the right army,
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; since he got in the right army 30 years
[1:31:56] ago, he's been in 30 something different
[1:31:59] countries and and they're calling him
[1:32:00] all the time wanting him to go to those
[1:32:02] countries. So God works in mysterious
[1:32:06] ways. Amen. God bless you. Love you with
[1:32:08] the love of the Lord. Remember the uh
[1:32:10] Yes.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Can I get a pray for
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Come on.
[1:32:24] Now, Brother Roger is
[1:32:26] Sister Cleleta's
[1:32:28] son-in-law, okay? He's married to Chi.
[1:32:31] And uh actually, I talked to Lauren the
[1:32:34] other day. She's doing okay. Trying to
[1:32:36] get her to come to church, but he has uh
[1:32:38] he's going to have open heart surgery.
[1:32:39] Now, this is one man standing here
[1:32:40] today. How many of y'all had open heart
[1:32:42] surgery? I didn't think so.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; This one has.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Canard,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and he's went through it. and Anna
[1:32:49] Canard already has at home, but he knows
[1:32:51] more than anything the struggle
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; of an open heart surgery. So, we're
[1:32:56] going to pray.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray number one that God
[1:32:58] will touch his soul.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Heal his soul first. Give me my heart
[1:33:02] transplant.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I fish with the fish, not for [music]
[1:33:06] fish.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That's fish for him. Fishers of men.
[1:33:08] That's right. Well, we're going to pray
[1:33:10] that God's going to change him and then
[1:33:12] help the doctors if he has to go through
[1:33:13] it just like we did with brother Boyd.
[1:33:15] Bless those hands, Lord. Let's pray.
[1:33:17] Dear heavenly father, Lord, where our
[1:33:18] brother stands here today. Lord, [music]
[1:33:21] we know brother Roger, Lord, and we've
[1:33:23] known him for a while. Father, I pray
[1:33:24] that you would be with him and bless
[1:33:25] him. He's a wonderful man to be around.
[1:33:28] Father, we pray that you'd touch his
[1:33:29] heart, Lord, the real heart, the one
[1:33:31] that the doctor's [music] not going to
[1:33:32] touch, but Dr. Jesus, you can touch his
[1:33:35] real heart. And Father, I pray that
[1:33:37] you'd be with the doctors as they
[1:33:38] perform the surgery, Lord. And that
[1:33:40] he'll come out of it, Lord, and be a
[1:33:42] better person, Father. Lord, show him as
[1:33:44] maybe this is something to tell him that
[1:33:46] he needs to get right with you, Father,
[1:33:48] and that that will happen, Lord. And our
[1:33:50] brother, Lord, I pray that you give
[1:33:51] Brother Boyd and ones that hang around
[1:33:53] him, Lord, the the wisdom to speak the
[1:33:55] words to him, Lord, that he'll come back
[1:33:57] to you, Father. I pray these things in
[1:33:59] Jesus name. Amen. Believe that you just
[1:34:02] hang around him.
[1:34:04] Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; You know, God will let somebody go
[1:34:09] through
[1:34:10] something.
[1:34:12] so that they can be a witness for
[1:34:14] another person.
[1:34:16] Could have let brother Boyd go through
[1:34:18] this. You think, "Boy, that's horrible."
[1:34:21] That's the way my God works.
[1:34:25] Amen. He'll let you go through a trial
[1:34:27] and a tribulation just so you can be
[1:34:29] what? An example
[1:34:32] and be a testimony of the test that you
[1:34:34] took. So sometimes we uh Paul says, "I
[1:34:38] glory in my infirmity." Why? because he
[1:34:40] wanted to show the people that God could
[1:34:42] heal you of anything.
[1:34:44] That's what [music] um I'll tell you
[1:34:47] this real quick what brother u um Daryl
[1:34:52] was telling about me about the surgery.
[1:34:53] This man, his his bowels had blown up
[1:34:56] and he was just absolutely
[1:34:58] gone. They had to take big sections of
[1:35:00] it out and and he had, you know, all
[1:35:03] kind of infection and all that stuff and
[1:35:04] they opened him up and and brother Daryl
[1:35:06] said he was standing in the in the
[1:35:08] operating room and he's like something
[1:35:11] came over him.
[1:35:13] You know what the doctor stood there and
[1:35:16] said he will never make it. He is not
[1:35:18] going to live.
[1:35:21] And brother Daryl was in his mind. He
[1:35:23] was thinking, you know, boy, this is bad
[1:35:24] because he's looking he's looking at
[1:35:26] this man's whole insides is completely
[1:35:28] rotten.
[1:35:29] He said something came over him and
[1:35:31] said, "Is there anything
[1:35:33] too hard for God?"
[1:35:37] And that man lived 10 more years.
[1:35:39] Brother Daryl prayed with him and and
[1:35:40] I'm sure he, you know, just being in
[1:35:42] Listen, being in the room with a
[1:35:44] believer sometimes is the greatest thing
[1:35:46] you'll ever have. Hello, somebody. You
[1:35:49] say, "Well, I don't feel that way." Hey,
[1:35:51] well, you better get something in your
[1:35:52] heart to feel that way. Amen. Cuz
[1:35:54] believers love believers.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We love our believers. We love the
[1:35:59] people that believe with us. And as we
[1:36:02] stand, as we stand today as the bride of
[1:36:04] Jesus Christ, as he said back there, we
[1:36:07] are going to be an invincible army.
[1:36:09] [music]
[1:36:11] Satan will not be able to stand against
[1:36:12] this bride.
[1:36:14] I believe that cuz I'm a believer.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it looks bad." Who who
[1:36:19] asked you about what he looked like
[1:36:22] when Jesus Christ hung on the cross?
[1:36:24] That was the worst, awful, pitiful thing
[1:36:26] you could ever see in your life. But it
[1:36:27] was the greatest thing that ever
[1:36:28] happened.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He was beginning
[1:36:32] to be the what? Firstborn from the dead.
[1:36:35] The beginning of the creation of God.
[1:36:37] The beginning of this new race. You and
[1:36:39] I are a part of that new race.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Today we are. That's what we're going to
[1:36:43] be speaking on. He didn't know that in a
[1:36:45] couple weeks cuz you're part of this. If
[1:36:47] you're not a part of this new race, then
[1:36:49] you're not going to understand the
[1:36:50] seals. But the seals are for you. The
[1:36:53] seals, as as brother Richard Wilson
[1:36:55] said, this message is summed up in one
[1:36:57] sentence.
[1:37:00] God and man are one.
[1:37:04] That's what brother Brandham wanted us
[1:37:06] to see was that God and man was one. Not
[1:37:09] God and man too. God and man was one.
[1:37:14] [music]
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:37:17] Christ. That makes us God made manifest
[1:37:19] in another form. I didn't make myself
[1:37:21] that. God did. God said he'd have
[1:37:24] somebody stand on the earth that would
[1:37:25] believe him. So, he had to send us a
[1:37:28] prophet to turn us into the right
[1:37:30] direction. And I believe he has. I
[1:37:32] believe we're heading in the right
[1:37:33] direction. So, God bless you. Love you
[1:37:35] with the love of the Lord. Let's bow our
[1:37:36] heads and be dismissed. Just remember
[1:37:38] us. They're coming up here Wednesday and
[1:37:40] [music] and then regular service next
[1:37:41] Sunday and it will be probably regular
[1:37:44] for the next uh until uh February when
[1:37:46] we have the banquet with brother Eric
[1:37:48] here. Uh we'll be speaking a good bit
[1:37:51] because we want to bring out some things
[1:37:52] on the seals that will help us through
[1:37:54] the year. So dear heavenly father, Lord,
[1:37:56] thank you for this day. Lord, I pray
[1:37:58] number one for our servant, Lord, that
[1:38:00] spoke to us today. That you'd give him
[1:38:01] strength, Father. That you would give
[1:38:03] him, Lord, um safe travel back home,
[1:38:05] Lord. And that you will bless each
[1:38:07] person that's in this building, Lord.
[1:38:09] That we've received something today from
[1:38:10] an eternal God. And I pray, Lord, that
[1:38:13] it will become part of us and we'll live
[1:38:15] it, Father, instead of just trying to
[1:38:16] remember it. Lord, we'll live it. It'll
[1:38:18] live through each and every one of us,
[1:38:20] Father. Just be with the ones that are
[1:38:22] sick, the ones that are not here, Sister
[1:38:23] Rebecca, and different ones that that
[1:38:25] sickness has come upon. And I pray that
[1:38:26] you'd break that spirit, Father. That
[1:38:28] you would break us, Lord, that spirit of
[1:38:30] there, Lord. I didn't mention, but
[1:38:32] Terrence and Lisa and all them, they
[1:38:33] have the they have the um bug and
[1:38:36] stomach bug. And Father, I pray that
[1:38:38] you'd that you'd bless them, Father,
[1:38:40] right now in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:38:41] that [snorts] you'd take all that away
[1:38:42] from each one, Lord, cuz we've all been
[1:38:44] through that and we're a witness so we
[1:38:46] can enter in, Lord, and ask you, Lord,
[1:38:48] that you would take them, Lord, and and
[1:38:50] raise our body up, Lord, get rid of that
[1:38:52] virus in all of us. I pray that that you
[1:38:55] would bless each one now. Lord, heal the
[1:38:58] sick.
[1:39:01] Lord, I mean the sin sick. Lord, it's
[1:39:04] time
[1:39:05] that Noah preached. It's going to rain.
[1:39:09] Well, as our brother said, the prophet
[1:39:11] of God brought us a message and now the
[1:39:14] real rain is beginning to fall. Father,
[1:39:16] be with us now as we continue on home
[1:39:19] and we come back together on Wednesday
[1:39:20] night. Father, just bless each one.
[1:39:22] Thank you for being with us today and
[1:39:24] with our brother. We ask your blessings
[1:39:26] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[1:39:28] You're dismissed. Go with the Lord.
[1:39:34] I am blessed.
[1:39:38] I am
[1:39:43] every [music]
[1:39:44] day that I [singing] live.

[1:40:01] [singing and music] am blessed.
[1:40:06] I [singing] am blessed
[1:40:10] through the sunshine
[1:40:13] and rain and even sorrows
[1:40:18] my pain. Jesus [music and singing]
[1:40:20] still is my comfort
[1:40:25] in God.
[1:40:28] [music]
[1:40:29] And his love comforts me. Oh, and
[1:40:33] [music and singing] his grace has set me
[1:40:37] free. And someday
[1:40:40] I shall stand [singing]
[1:40:44] by his son.
[1:40:47] And I [singing]
[1:40:48] am blessed. [music]
[1:40:51] Oh, I'm so blessed.
[1:40:54] So blessed. Every [singing and music]

[1:41:15] am blessed. [music]

[1:41:23] [music] and I help [singing] you for my
[1:41:27] feet. And I have many
[1:41:32] toe
[1:41:33] and a home [music] up in heaven
[1:41:38] [singing] by and
