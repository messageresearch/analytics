[0:00] Amen. Sometimes I think we we won't
[0:02] really fully understand it till we get
[0:03] there.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; We get a glimpse of it inside of our
[0:07] life, our heart, but perfect love.
[0:10] That's who God is. It's a person, the
[0:12] very person of Jesus Christ. Are you
[0:14] thankful to be in his house this
[0:16] morning? Amen. We come to worship him,
[0:18] spirit and truth. And so, just turn to
[0:21] your neighbor and shake each other's
[0:22] hand as we sing that once more. Oh, when
[0:25] we all
[0:27] get to heaven,
[0:30] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[0:36] when we all
[0:38] see Jesus
[0:42] and sing and shout the victory.
[0:47] Oh, sing the wondrous love of Jesus. See
[0:54] his mercy
[0:56] and it's about his grace in the meion
[1:01] bright and left. Oh, he'll prepare for
[1:06] salation.
[1:08] Oh, when we all
[1:12] get together.
[1:14] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:20] when we all
[1:23] see Jesus
[1:26] sing and shout victory.
[1:31] Hallelujah.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that course
[1:35] touching Jesus. And uh we're going to
[1:37] ask brother Jeffrey if he would come and
[1:39] lead us in Bible reading this morning.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; We're just thankful for God. Uh I I love
[1:45] to use people and their gifts and
[1:47] talents in the body of Christ.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; You know, your body was made to walk and
[1:52] to move and to exercise and to each
[1:55] member has a part and plays. And so we
[1:58] just thank the Lord for
[1:59] &gt;&gt; um him using all of us in our capacity.
[2:03] You just never know what you know,
[2:05] brother Brown said, if you if you ever
[2:07] think, Lord, what do you want to use me
[2:09] for? He said, try it. If you feel that
[2:11] desire of something, see if God uses
[2:13] that gift in your life. You never know
[2:15] what God can can do through through your
[2:18] life. So, we're going to ask him to come
[2:19] this morning. Touching Jesus
[2:24] is all that really matters.
[2:31] And your life will never be
[2:36] the same.
[2:41] There is only
[2:44] one way to touch
[2:51] you.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[3:01] Lord this morning.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Y'all come expecting expecting to get
[3:05] fed this morning.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; All right. All right, we're going to be
[3:07] reading from uh Romans 8
[3:13] 1-2
[3:23] and we'll speak to the author before we
[3:25] go to the word. Bow your heads. Precious
[3:28] heavenly father, Lord, we just thank you
[3:29] for this wonderful day you've given us,
[3:31] Lord, and the opportunity for us to come
[3:32] together and worship you. We just thank
[3:34] you for all your blessings, Lord, you
[3:36] bestow upon each one of us, Lord. And we
[3:38] just ask that you come down, Lord, and
[3:40] open our hearts tonight this this
[3:41] morning, Lord, that we may receive you
[3:43] and
[3:45] and just be with all the ones here this
[3:47] morning and be with brother Daryl, Lord,
[3:49] as he's studying, Lord. Just you come
[3:51] through him and speak to us, Lord, and
[3:53] and we come with expectations, Lord, and
[3:56] bless the reading of the word. We ask
[3:58] all these things in your precious name,
[3:59] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:05] There is therefore now no condemnation
[4:08] to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
[4:10] walk not after the flesh, but after the
[4:12] spirit.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; For the law, the spirit of life in
[4:16] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[4:19] law of sin and death.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, and that
[4:25] it was weak through the flesh, God
[4:28] sending his own son in the likeness of
[4:30] sinful flesh. and for sin condemn sin in
[4:34] the flesh
[4:36] &gt;&gt; that the righteousness of the law might
[4:38] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[4:41] the flesh but after the spirit.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; For they that are after the flesh do
[4:47] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[4:49] that are after the spirit the things of
[4:51] the spirit.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; To be spiritually minded is life and
[4:58] peace. Because the carnal mind is immity
[5:01] against God, for it is not subject to
[5:04] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; God,
[5:12] &gt;&gt; but ye are not in the flesh, but in the
[5:14] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[5:17] dwell in you. Now if any man have not in
[5:20] the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[5:24] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[5:26] dead because of sit
[5:30] righteousness.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of him that raised up
[5:34] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[5:36] that raised up Christ from the dead
[5:39] shall also quicken our mortal your
[5:41] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[5:43] dwelleth in you. Therefore, brethren, we
[5:46] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[5:49] after the flesh.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be seated.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:04] Yeah. Brother, um continue to remember
[6:07] brother Donnie in your prayer. I know um
[6:10] him having a um his surgery. He's a
[6:13] former Marine and it's hard to uh hold
[6:15] hold down a former Marine. He said, "I
[6:17] want to be there." I said, "You let your
[6:19] body heal. just just let let the Lord
[6:22] work in your body, you know, and uh you
[6:25] just watch. We're we're here and the
[6:27] Lord knows all things. So, but we're
[6:29] we're thankful for brother Donnie,
[6:31] brother Kie. Uh I call brother Kie our
[6:34] um Errol Jones. If you don't know who
[6:38] Errol Jones is, he had like that radio
[6:40] voice and and Brother Kie has stood
[6:43] faithful here for many years, many
[6:45] years. And so, we're thankful for that.

[6:49] morning and take up the offering?

[7:10] fullness when the reward comes. Lord, we

[7:18] ourselves, Lord. And may we do so with
[7:20] the opening of the word.

[7:23] Lord, Father. And we ask that you'll

[7:27] Father.

[12:24] are washed
[12:26] away. Hey, let's sing that first verse.
[12:29] And no one knew
[12:32] how alone I was feeling.
[12:38] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[12:42] hide.
[12:45] And though I laughed and said my life
[12:49] was fine without you,
[12:54] I was covering up the secret. Tears I
[12:58] cried.
[13:01] And one day someone told me of your
[13:06] mercy
[13:09] and the love you showed that day of
[13:13] Calvary.
[13:17] There you
[13:20] purchase my redemption
[13:25] when you broke sin heart and set my
[13:30] spirit free. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm amazed
[13:37] that you love me.

[13:45] that you came

[13:57] and my sins
[14:00] are all
[14:02] they're all washed away. Oh, my sins
[14:08] are washed
[14:10] away.
[14:13] And yes, it's true.
[14:15] There have been days when I felt you.
[14:21] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[14:26] astray,
[14:29] but I've learned your love is stronger
[14:33] than. Are you thankful for that this
[14:35] morning?
[14:37] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[14:45] No one else has ever cared for me like
[14:50] you, Lord.

[21:33] reveal itself through music, through
[21:36] languages that

[21:40] voice speak to you through that. And you
[21:43] know the song is as a deer panteth for
[21:47] the water so my soul
[21:49] thirst after thee. Don't lose that
[21:51] thirst in your life.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; If you're not thirsty pray for it
[21:55] &gt;&gt; because you're you are quenching that
[21:58] thirst in you with something. It could
[22:00] be the things of the world but it's
[22:01] meant for the one who created you.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it takes a long time in
[22:06] people's lives and young folks and old

[33:13] onto Jesus.
[33:16] Lord, he did what he
[33:19] one more time. Cast your burdens. Oh,
[33:21] cast your burdens
[33:24] onto Jesus
[33:27] for he cares
[33:30] for you.
[33:32] will cast your burden
[33:35] unto Jesus
[33:38] for he cares
[33:41] for you.
[33:43] Amen. Let's give God a good hand clap of
[33:45] praise. Good to be in the house of the
[33:47] Lord.
[33:50] Good to be alive and well.
[33:53] Amen. We had a wonderful time yesterday.
[33:56] We appreciate everybody for coming and
[33:58] cooking and all that. We had uh had a a
[34:01] rather large crowd yesterday. So, we
[34:03] sure appreciate all the food that you
[34:05] that you cooked. And brother Daryl
[34:07] poured his heart out yesterday. Well,
[34:08] he's rested up, ready to pour his heart
[34:10] out again today. And uh he'll be with us
[34:13] uh today. And then we'll uh I'll be
[34:16] speaking this coming Wednesday and get
[34:17] everything started. Sunday before
[34:19] Sunday,
[34:20] it's going to sound weird. We're going
[34:22] to start on the seals, but I want you to
[34:23] read Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[34:25] Read the book. Listen to the tape.
[34:26] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[34:30] All right. Between now and Sunday,
[34:32] Sunday, we'll start on the uh on the
[34:34] seals and the teaching there. But just
[34:37] keep us in prayer. You stay in prayer
[34:39] for yourself that we'll receive. And
[34:41] just remember, too, that the banquet,
[34:43] you need to RSVP or sign up downstairs.
[34:46] If you're bringing someone with you, uh
[34:49] a couple, now these couples now, not
[34:51] individual, couples. If you're bringing
[34:53] couples with you, we need to RSVP them
[34:57] also. That way we can have enough for
[34:59] the caterer and that Anna and them can
[35:01] get all the um plates all to accommodate
[35:05] that many people. Uh the group from Ohio
[35:08] is coming and they're going to be here
[35:10] Friday and we're going to uh have a
[35:12] little fellowship with them and then
[35:13] Saturday and then brother Isaac will be
[35:15] speaking just for a few moments Saturday
[35:17] at the banquet and then Sunday brother
[35:19] Eric Gael from Honduras uh will be here
[35:21] speaking for us on Sunday they're coming
[35:23] to the banquet also. So uh we when we
[35:26] were what when we were over there in
[35:28] what December uh Christine we were there
[35:30] in December and I asked him I said you
[35:32] like to come. He said yeah I'd like to
[35:33] come. I said, "Well, you're preaching
[35:34] that Sunday." If you come, if you're
[35:36] going to drive all the way from
[35:37] Honduras, you might as well do
[35:38] something.
[35:40] But everybody knows Brother Eric and we
[35:42] love him and support him and and love
[35:44] him with the love of the Lord. So, and
[35:45] also remember that if you are coming to
[35:48] the banquet, there will be and you need
[35:50] to or we can help you make arrangements
[35:53] for babysitting because there's some
[35:56] won't be going. I think maybe there'll
[35:58] be some coming from Ohio that's single
[36:00] that may help, but we will find a
[36:02] babysitter somewhere. My house is open
[36:05] like it always is. Hannah, my daughter,
[36:07] said she would be there to help us. So,
[36:10] if anybody needs a babysitter, uh we'll
[36:12] find you one. But, uh this is this is a
[36:15] uh I don't know, we've tried to figure
[36:17] out how many years it was. It's at least
[36:19] 15 or more that we've had the the
[36:22] Valentine's banquet, and it's got bigger
[36:23] and bigger every year. So, uh, it's just
[36:25] a time we can all get together and what
[36:28] said there stays there.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; One more time, what's said there stays
[36:33] there.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; No, we have a good time in the Lord.
[36:37] We'll have a good catered meal and then
[36:39] we will uh then we'll uh do some games
[36:42] and prizes and have brother Isaac speak
[36:44] a minute for us and and then we will uh
[36:47] have a good time just fellowshipping
[36:48] with each other. Uh, good to see brother
[36:50] K's with us today. I missed you the
[36:51] other day when I wasn't here, but good
[36:53] to see you, man. Good, good to have you
[36:54] with us. And uh we love you with the
[36:56] love of the Lord. Good to have our
[36:57] brother back with us there. Good to see
[36:59] you. Yep. Good to have you back with us.
[37:00] Amen. You ready for the word?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; This is the most important thing.
[37:04] Listen, I sp I spoke Wednesday in what?
[37:06] Expectation. Did you expect you was
[37:08] going to hear from God today?
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; I got up this morning expecting that God
[37:12] was going to speak to me through song,
[37:16] Jeffrey, and Amy.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] That was a surprise.
[37:29] It really wasn't a surprise.
[37:31] Something I was expecting. So, the Lord
[37:34] places people in, takes people out, puts
[37:36] people in. If God does it, it's always
[37:38] going to be successful. Always.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; So, good to have them. They've grown up
[37:42] in this church, brought their kids up in
[37:44] the church, and we sure do appreciate
[37:46] them and appreciate that uh Brother Jeff
[37:49] helping us out there with the with our
[37:52] responsive reading. So, all minds and
[37:54] hearts clear, you're expecting
[37:56] something.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; We're expecting to hear from God today.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not expecting to hear
[38:01] from God, like I said before, if you're
[38:03] expecting and you got so much
[38:05] expectation, just drop a little over on
[38:07] your neighbor that ain't expecting much.
[38:10] Amen. If your cup overflows, what does
[38:12] it do? Just makes a mess everywhere,
[38:13] doesn't it? Just all falls all over the
[38:15] counter and everything. Well, all right,
[38:17] Sister Regina, you just let it all pour
[38:19] out. Let it all go and we'll be sitting
[38:22] over there and get all kind of wet. I
[38:24] want to get wet by the what? The water
[38:25] of the word.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; So, let's sing as our brother comes,
[38:28] Brother Daryl Ward from Johnson City,
[38:29] Tennessee. He's always he I always ask
[38:32] him to come and already ask him for next
[38:33] year in January if we're still here
[38:36] because I believe that he is one of the
[38:38] most humble men I've ever met and he has
[38:40] a testimony and the Lord has used him. I
[38:43] told him you know he was in the
[38:44] operating room for about 15 years um
[38:48] there in in Tennessee and and I told him
[38:51] I said you probably helped more people
[38:54] out of the operating room than you ever
[38:56] helped in the operating room those 15
[38:58] years. And he told me a couple of
[38:59] testimonies. One for sure that that God
[39:02] moved on somebody. If if I'm operated
[39:05] on, I want some holy hands around there
[39:07] somewhere.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And brother Daryl was there and he he
[39:10] prayed for this one man that they the
[39:12] doctor pronounced him he was not going
[39:13] to live. He was going to die. And God
[39:17] just give him 10 more years.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; 10 years.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; 10 more years. The doctor said he'll
[39:23] never survive. He'll never make it. But
[39:26] he did. But he just didn't that position
[39:29] didn't know the great physician,
[39:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was practicing and the God we got
[39:33] don't practice. He does what he said
[39:35] he'd do. So let's sing as we have our
[39:37] brother come, brother Daryl Warden from
[39:38] Johnson City, Tennessee, and speak for
[39:41] us today.
[39:44] Long reserve
[39:47] for our walk
[39:50] in this world.
[39:53] They resound
[39:55] with God's own heart.
[39:57] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[40:03] Words of life,
[40:05] words of hope
[40:08] gives us strength
[40:10] and helps us cope.
[40:13] In this world,
[40:15] wherever we roll, the word of God will
[40:20] guide us home.
[40:23] Word of God, ever true, never failure,
[40:28] changing me and changing you.
[40:33] And we have come
[40:35] with open hearts.
[40:38] Let the word of God impart
[40:43] and holy works
[40:46] of our faith
[40:48] is handed down
[40:51] to this age. Great warriors brought you
[40:53] the word
[40:56] through sacrifice.
[40:58] Oh he the faithful work of Christ.
[41:03] Holy word,
[41:06] long brings everything
[41:09] for our
[41:11] in this world.
[41:14] We resound
[41:16] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[41:20] of God.
[41:24] Words of God,
[41:26] ever true
[41:29] changing me and changing you.
[41:34] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[41:39] the word of God.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; To me, that's the key is to come with an
[41:51] open heart.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we sing that song, Fill
[41:56] My Cup. But I believe if we had a real
[41:59] revelation of how the Lord wanted to
[42:00] bless us, we would sing Fill My Truck.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet said he
[42:12] wants to give you the Holy Ghost even
[42:14] more than you want to receive it.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; The love of God, how rich, how pure.
[42:19] Yes,
[42:19] &gt;&gt; sir. I was thinking as singing that song
[42:21] of way up in the cold country of Alaska,
[42:24] the little Eskimo village of Chivac.
[42:27] They was singing that song. It just took
[42:29] me back there for a minute there.
[42:31] Precious people back up there about 150
[42:33] mile below the Arctic Circle.
[42:36] No red lights, no cars, just snowmobiles
[42:39] and four-wheelers, but they love the
[42:41] Lord just as much as you do.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We greet you in the
[42:45] name of the Lord Jesus and count it an
[42:46] honor to be with you once again and
[42:48] certainly enjoyed the song service and
[42:50] the fellowship and appreciate the food
[42:52] yesterday and all the hands provided. It
[42:53] was just it was just wonderful to see
[42:56] some brother Mike Hannis and some of
[42:57] those folks. It was just really such a
[42:59] good time and
[43:00] &gt;&gt; thank you for allowing us to come.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning,
[43:03] turn with us to the book of Mark. We
[43:05] want to read from Mark chapter 14 at
[43:07] verse 36. And I bring you greetings from
[43:09] my pastor, brother Donnie Reagan. Told
[43:10] me to tell you all hello and bring
[43:12] greetings to you from my family.
[43:14] and we just count it an honor to be here
[43:16] and with you today.
[43:21] Mark chapter 14 verse 36.
[43:33] The Bible says this.
[43:36] And he said, "Aba Father,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; all things are possible unto thee."
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. take away this cup from me.
[43:45] Nevertheless, not what I will,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; but what thou wilt.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; And he cometh and findeth them sleeping,
[43:53] and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest
[43:56] thou?
[43:58] Couldest thou not watch one hour?
[44:01] Watch ye and pray, least ye enter into
[44:04] temptation.
[44:06] The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh
[44:09] is weak. And again he went away and
[44:12] prayed and spake the same words.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And when he returned,
[44:17] he found them asleep again, for their
[44:19] eyes were heavy, neither witch day what
[44:22] to answer him. And he cometh the third
[44:25] time, and saith unto them, sleep on now.
[44:29] Take your rest. It is enough. The hour
[44:33] is come. Behold, the Son of Man is
[44:36] betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[44:40] Rise up, let us go. Lo, he that
[44:43] betrayeth me is at hand. Let's bow our
[44:48] heads. I want to speak to this morning
[44:50] for just a few minutes on the season of
[44:53] recognition.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Or the hour is come.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord for all that you've done
[45:03] for us. Bless your children today Lord
[45:05] as we surrender this congregation and
[45:08] oursel into your hands for your glory in
[45:11] Jesus name. God bless you. You may be
[45:13] seated.
[45:17] Go with me this morning for just a
[45:20] minute.
[45:22] We take this little trip. We find oursel
[45:25] in a garden
[45:28] and we see
[45:31] a man kneeling,
[45:33] crying out and we notice that he's
[45:37] shaken
[45:39] &gt;&gt; and afraid.
[45:41] And we know that the Bible teaches us
[45:43] that this man went a stone throw away
[45:46] from his friends to pray
[45:50] because he needed to be alone. And yet
[45:53] he didn't want to be alone.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; For it was his hour of rrestling out his
[45:58] will.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that he prayed
[46:02] earnestly
[46:04] that if there should be a way that the
[46:06] cup could pass from him. And we can
[46:10] almost hear him as he's crying out
[46:11] saying, "Father,
[46:14] all things are possible.
[46:16] You can do anything. Don't make me drink
[46:21] this cup.
[46:27] And he gets up and he goes back and he
[46:30] finds his disciples sleeping and he
[46:32] says, "Wake up. Pray with me."
[46:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; "Would you just pray with me?" And he
[46:38] goes back and the Bible says that being
[46:41] in agony, he prayed more earnestly.
[46:44] And this sweat, as it were, great drops
[46:46] of blood fall into the ground.
[46:49] And we see him in his flesh, in his
[46:52] shaken, and in his fear, and in his
[46:54] rrestle. And you said Jesus afraid.
[46:58] Well, the Bible says, "Who in the days
[47:00] of his flesh, when he had offered up
[47:02] prayers and supplications with strong
[47:04] crying and tears unto him who was able
[47:07] to save him from death,
[47:10] &gt;&gt; and was heard in that he feared,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and he prayed more earnestly, as it
[47:15] were, as sweat, were great drops of
[47:17] blood falling to the ground." Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Now there is a medical condition called
[47:22] hematradosis.
[47:23] And hematidosis is a rare medical
[47:26] condition where the sweat glands that
[47:28] contain the capillaries that feed the
[47:30] sweat glands, they rupture and seep into
[47:33] the sweat glands and they actually sweat
[47:36] blood.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; It can be triggered by extreme physical
[47:40] and emotional anguish.
[47:43] And he comes back to find Peter and him
[47:46] sleeping. And he says, "Peter, wake up,
[47:49] Peter.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Could you not watch with me one hour?"
[47:54] &gt;&gt; And Peter, I could just see him as he he
[47:56] wakes up and he maybe rubbing his eyes.
[47:59] He says, "Master, is a what's the
[48:01] matter? You're shaking?
[48:04] Is that is that blood on you? Are you
[48:06] bleeding?"
[48:08] He said, "Peter, watch with me. Help me
[48:11] pray. said, 'Lord,
[48:15] what what shall I pray?
[48:18] And the Bible says he comes back a third
[48:20] time. And when he comes back the third
[48:22] time, he said unto them, "Sleep on and
[48:26] take your rest. It's enough. The hour is
[48:28] come.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Behold, he, the son of man, is betrayed
[48:32] into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let
[48:35] us go. Lo, he that betrayeth me is at
[48:37] hand." Now the hour had come. The hour
[48:41] denotes a certain definite time or
[48:44] season. And Jesus was saying here
[48:47] speaking he said father the time has
[48:49] come. Now the prophet said there's
[48:51] seasons for everything. Do you believe
[48:53] that you sew in a certain season and you
[48:55] reap in a certain season and there's
[48:57] seasons when the time comes that's right
[48:59] for things to happen. He said do you
[49:01] believe that? See see certain seasons
[49:04] bring certain responses. Yes.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Watermelon and picnics in the summer cuz
[49:11] it's the season.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Hot chocolate and vegetable soup
[49:16] &gt;&gt; in the winter
[49:18] &gt;&gt; because it's the season for it. And each
[49:21] season carries its anointing.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Each season carries its anointing.
[49:27] There's things that God has promised for
[49:29] this age that would happen. And there's
[49:31] a people on the earth now whose very
[49:33] purpose for being here is to fulfill
[49:36] these promises.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; For this cause was they born. You were
[49:40] born for a purpose. The season of these
[49:43] things to happen is here. The hour has
[49:45] come.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus was praying to the father. He
[49:49] acknowledged that he is aware that this
[49:50] is his time. All the preparation, the
[49:53] first two pulls of his ministry, all the
[49:55] fishes and the loaves and the miracles
[49:57] was to get the people's attention to a
[50:00] vindicate who he was. It had come down
[50:02] to this very hour. The hour is come.
[50:06] Jesus coming down to the end of his
[50:08] ministry and his very purpose for being
[50:10] on the earth. The hour of his purpose
[50:13] had come and the words of the prophets
[50:15] would be fulfilled.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we find Jesus now in Pilate's
[50:20] hall, judgment hall, betrayed by a
[50:22] message follower
[50:26] &gt;&gt; who walked with him, who said he loved
[50:28] him, who was a part of the message. Now
[50:30] all of a sudden, he forsakes the message
[50:33] and betrays the messenger.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my God,
[50:38] &gt;&gt; where are we at?
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Judas sold him out for 30 pieces of
[50:43] silver.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Today, they sell him out for an internet
[50:46] spot.
[50:48] Come on, somebody.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Pilate said unto him, "Art thou a king
[50:53] then?" And Jesus answered, "Thou sayest,
[50:55] I a king. To this end was I born. For
[50:58] this cause came I into the world, that I
[51:02] should bear witness unto the truth, AND
[51:04] EVERYONE THAT IS OF the truth
[51:06] &gt;&gt; heareth my voice."
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; That ought to make you shout this
[51:09] morning. Everyone that is of the truth
[51:12] heareth my voice.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; The hour has come. the season, the words
[51:17] that the prophet has spoke has come into
[51:19] manifestation IN PILATE'S JUDGMENT HALL.
[51:22] THEY SAID, "PILATE, this man claims to
[51:24] be the son of God."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; When Pilate therefore heard that saying,
[51:28] he was more afraid. And he went again
[51:30] into the judgment hall and said unto
[51:31] Jesus, "Whence art thou?" But Jesus gave
[51:34] him no answer.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; He stood before Pilate, and Pilate SAID,
[51:38] "WHAT IS TRUTH?" Think about this. He
[51:41] said, "Pilate standing there. Jesus
[51:43] standing there." And Pilate says, "What
[51:44] is truth?" AND TRUTH WAS STANDING RIGHT
[51:47] BEFORE HIM
[51:49] &gt;&gt; and he didn't recognize it. And we're
[51:51] LIVING IN THE SAME ERA WHERE PEOPLE ARE
[51:53] TODAY ARE SAYING, "WHAT is truth?"
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Because of all the AI and the things
[51:58] people don't even know what to believe.
[52:00] WE'VE MADE FULL CIRCLE. WE'RE BACK HERE
[52:02] AGAIN.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; AND TRUTH IS STANDING BEFORE THIS NATION
[52:05] AND THEY'VE REJECTED IT.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] Amen. Then said Pilate unto him, Speakst
[52:14] thou not unto me? Knowest thou not I
[52:16] have power to crucify thee, and I have
[52:18] power to release thee? And Jesus
[52:20] answered, Thou couldst have no power at
[52:22] all against me, except it were given
[52:24] thee from above.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he that deliverth me unto
[52:27] thee hath the greater sin.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; The hour has come for the fulfillment of
[52:32] the prophecy. God's word will not return
[52:35] unto him void.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. THEN IF GOD SAID THERE'LL BE
[52:40] A RAPTURE, THERE'LL BE A RAPTURE. IF THE
[52:42] GOD SAID OUR BODIES WILL BE CHANGED in a
[52:44] moment, in a TWINKLE OF AN EYE, THAT'S
[52:46] THE WAY IT'LL BE. AMEN. THE WORD WILL
[52:48] not return unto him void,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; but it will accomplish that which it was
[52:51] sent to do. AND NO ONE CAN STOP IT. OH,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOBODY CAN, NO GOVERNMENT,
[52:57] NO NATION, NO WAR, NO NUCLEAR WEAPON CAN
[53:00] STOP GOD FROM FULFILLING HIS WORD.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. No one can stop it. Jesus
[53:06] recognized his hour. said, "The hour has
[53:09] come." The hour has come.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Came time for Noah to go into the ark.
[53:14] Look, Noah could not have gone into the
[53:16] ark before God was ready for him to go.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet said God would not
[53:22] be a just God to send someone to
[53:24] judgment that was just. And Noah, oh,
[53:28] don't miss this. Noah was the
[53:30] preparation before judgment.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his
[53:35] message. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Just think about it for a minute. If
[53:40] this congregation right here was the
[53:42] days of Noah, do you realize only eight
[53:45] of us would went into that boat?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Think about that. What a small minority.
[53:55] If this was the days of Noah, only eight
[53:57] in this room would have got into that
[53:59] boat.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Would you have got in it,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; brother?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Huh? Yes.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Would you have got in the boat? Only
[54:07] eight souls did.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; But in order to get into the boat, you
[54:11] would have had to one to believe he was
[54:14] a prophet against all those who said he
[54:16] was false.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You had to believe that his message was
[54:20] from God, REGARDLESS OF HOW SIMPLE it
[54:23] was.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Three, you had to go against all the
[54:27] INTERNET AND THE SCIENCE IN THAT DAY
[54:29] &gt;&gt; THAT said that it's it's not going to
[54:31] rain. THERE'S NOTHING UP THERE FOR IT TO
[54:33] RAIN. HE'S NOTHING BUT A LIAR.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; BUT I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IF YOU
[54:38] COULD SEE YOUR DAY, HALLELUJAH, YOU
[54:41] WOULD HAVE SEEN HIS DAY.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE SAME GOD THAT REVEALED IT
[54:46] TO NOAH HAS REVEALED OUR DAY TO US.
[54:49] AMEN.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the season came for Noah to
[54:52] go into the ark, God shut the door
[54:54] behind Noah.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Noah didn't shut the door. GOD
[54:58] DID. AND ALL OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE ELSE
[55:00] TO EVER ENTER WAS gone because God had
[55:04] closed the door. Amen. The hour had
[55:07] come. The season was right. Amen. Noah's
[55:09] message was the preparation for escape.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Can you just imagine? Look at just a
[55:16] moment. God was preparing. Noah's
[55:18] preaching. And the first thing you know,
[55:20] WHILE ONE DAY THERE COME A THUNDER, A
[55:23] blast and I see the first lightning come
[55:26] up and flash across the sky. The season
[55:28] of fulfillment had come. The hour had
[55:30] come for Noah to go into the ark. He
[55:33] began to fill the pool.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And Noah said, "Come on, honey." Boy
[55:37] said to the wives, "Come on, honey." And
[55:38] they got into the ark. And the people
[55:40] said, "I wonder what happened."
[55:43] &gt;&gt; A blast went off somewhere. IT MUST HAVE
[55:45] BEEN A ROCKET OR SOMETHING.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; A BLAST WENT OFF SOMEWHERE AND A CLOUD
[55:49] BEGAN TO RISE. WHAT WAS IT? A SIGN THAT
[55:52] THE HOUR IS COME. THE FULFILLMENT OF THE
[55:54] PROPHET'S MESSAGE. AMEN.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Noah's message was the preparation for
[55:58] the escape. AND WITH THE BLAST OF
[56:00] THUNDER AND THE RISING OF A SUPERNATURAL
[56:02] CLOUD
[56:03] &gt;&gt; WAS THE evidence that the message was
[56:06] ripe. THERE WAS A BLAST FOLLOWED BY A
[56:09] CLOUD AND THE CLOUD WAS THE SIGN.
[56:12] BEHOLD, THE RAIN COMETH.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH, think about this. IT HAD NOT
[56:20] RAINED FOR THREE and a half years of a
[56:23] drought. He was in the land and up on a
[56:27] mountain
[56:28] PRAYING SIX TIMES HE SENT GAHESA.
[56:32] NOTHING. There's nothing out there.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; The seventh time he sent Gahesa. And
[56:37] Gahesa come back. He said, "I see a
[56:39] cloud the size of a man's hand. Right?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; IN A HOT, DRY CLIMATE WHERE THERE HAD
[56:47] BEEN NO RAIN FOR three and a half years,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; A CLOUD THAT SMALL WOULD HAVE just
[56:53] vapored away.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; BUT WHY DIDN'T IT? BECAUSE IT WAS A
[56:58] SUPERNATURAL CLOUD.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; AND IT TESTIFIED. WHAT DID THAT CLOUD
[57:03] TESTIFY OF? AN ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WAS
[57:06] COMING.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; The hour had come. The rain WAS GOING TO
[57:09] FALL. GOD VINDICATED HIS PROPHET. THE
[57:12] CLOUD WAS THE RECOGNITION that the rain
[57:15] was coming.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they got into the ARK
[57:20] AND GOD SHUT THE DOOR. AND ALL THOSE WHO
[57:22] LAUGHED AT HIM AND MOCKED AT HIM, ALL OF
[57:24] THE SUDDEN THE RAIN BEGIN TO FALL. BUT
[57:26] IT WAS TOO LATE.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And I can hear him cry out, "Oh, Noah.
[57:30] Noah, we was just aggravating YOU,
[57:31] BUDDY. PLEASE LET US IN. LET US IN.
[57:33] NOAH, OPEN THE DOOR. For God's sake,
[57:37] Noah, IF YOU DON'T TAKE ME, TAKE MY
[57:38] BABY. DON'T LET MY BABY PERISH. LET ME
[57:42] IN. LET ME IN. But you see, Noah could
[57:44] not OPEN THE DOOR CUZ HE NEVER SHUT IT.
[57:46] AMEN.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; AND I TELL you young people, I tell you,
[57:49] brother, sister, if you feel that pull
[57:51] today AND YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU NEED TO
[57:52] BE, GET INSIDE THE ARK OF SAFETY.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity to escape
[58:01] this unto generation. Amen. That's
[58:03] right.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet told the story of the son of
[58:07] man who owned the company, the meat
[58:08] packing company of Chicago. And he went
[58:11] out west to a ranch to find a bride. And
[58:14] he asked this little girl if she would
[58:17] marry him. And she said yes.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's got to be more than a
[58:23] nod. You've got to make your voice
[58:25] heard. You've got to identify your voice
[58:28] with this message. And the best way to
[58:30] do it is WITH AN AMEN AND A HALLELUJAH.
[58:32] I BELIEVE IT, LORD.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He asked her, "Will you marry me?" She
[58:36] said, "Yes." And he promised her he
[58:38] would come back FOR HER AT A CERTAIN
[58:40] TIME FOR HER to be ready.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. As the season
[58:45] approached, all that time after he left,
[58:48] she was among all these other ranch
[58:50] workers and all these other people. But
[58:53] all of a sudden, when the season was
[58:55] right, she goes into a little room
[59:00] &gt;&gt; and puts on a wedding garment.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Not one person of that ranch helped her.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; N
[59:09] &gt;&gt; you see, she made
[59:12] herself
[59:14] &gt;&gt; ready.
[59:16] Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And she came out no longer identify as a
[59:20] as a dishwash lady. Right?
[59:22] &gt;&gt; SHE CAME OUT IDENTIFIED AS A BRIDE. AND
[59:25] AS SHE BEGAN TO IDENTIFY AND EXPRESS WHO
[59:28] SHE WAS, THAT'S WHEN the critics
[59:31] started.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Are you hearing me, friends? Do
[59:34] you not see where we're at?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. She made herself ready. And the
[59:40] first thing you know, what did they do?
[59:41] THEY GOT AROUND HER, BE TO DANCE AND
[59:44] SING SONGS AND MAKE FUN OF her
[59:50] &gt;&gt; and made out like they WERE THE BRIDE,
[59:52] PRETENDING to be a bride. BUT IT ALL THE
[59:54] CRITICS, ALL THE HARASSMENT, ALL THE
[59:57] THINGS THAT THEY POSTED ON THE INTERNET,
[59:59] IT DID NOT BOTHER HER.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS CERTAIN, AMEN, THAT THE PROMISE
[1:00:05] THAT HE HAD GAVE HER WAS TRUE.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Her eyes wouldn't critics. Her eyes was
[1:00:11] on the promise.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT
[1:00:16] THIS MORNING? DON'T LOOK AT THE CRITICS.
[1:00:18] LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID. AMEN.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; She watched that little old clock tick
[1:00:23] up and the first thing you know it was
[1:00:24] about one minute. Oh, I saw the other
[1:00:27] day that that doomsday clock, I forget
[1:00:29] how many seconds they said it was 45,
[1:00:31] 50, something like that, seconds from
[1:00:33] destruction. The old clock is ticking
[1:00:35] right up. And she was watching that
[1:00:37] clock in about 1 minute.
[1:00:41] Oh my. And someone said, "I thought he
[1:00:44] was coming.
[1:00:46] He's supposed to be HERE AT A SUCH AND
[1:00:47] SUCH TIME.
[1:00:49] Don't worry. He'll be here."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's all I want to know. He promised
[1:00:54] he'd be here. That's all I want to know.
[1:00:56] HE'S COMING. THAT'S ALL. WHEN I DON'T
[1:00:57] KNOW, but I'll be ready when he comes.
[1:01:00] I'VE GOT THE WEDDING GARMENT ON.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE DRESSED MYSELF IN THE
[1:01:05] REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. AMEN.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; The hour has come for his return. The
[1:01:10] season is right. The promise isn't true.
[1:01:13] Amen. And right while they were making
[1:01:15] the most fun. While they were making the
[1:01:18] most fun and all these different things
[1:01:20] about her and teasing her and making fun
[1:01:22] of her and everything, they heard the
[1:01:24] wheels are coming and the horse hoofs
[1:01:26] are beating and the old grind of the
[1:01:28] sand under THE BOOKBOARD AND SHE BROKE
[1:01:30] THROUGH THOSE LINES AND OUT INTO THE
[1:01:31] YARD she went. WHO WAS IT? THERE HE WAS
[1:01:34] DRESSED.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE CARRIAGE WAS READY. AND
[1:01:38] HE GRABBED her into his arms and put her
[1:01:40] up on the bookboard and turned the
[1:01:41] carriage to Chicago.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; I'll come for you. He promised her. And
[1:01:45] when you see this happening, get ready.
[1:01:48] The hour has come.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; The pool
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; is at hand.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in John 16:21, "A woman
[1:01:56] when she is in travail have sorrow
[1:01:59] because her hour has come. But as soon
[1:02:02] as she's delivered of the child, she
[1:02:04] remembers no more the anguish
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; for joy that a man is born into the
[1:02:09] world. A woman knows when it's her hour,
[1:02:12] not the neighbors,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; not the neighbor's time, not someone
[1:02:16] else's time, but that birth pain strikes
[1:02:19] her. She recognizes it
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; that the hour, her hour
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; has come.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; We have at home a program called Ask a
[1:02:29] Nurse. My wife is a registered nurse,
[1:02:32] surgical nurse, and she was pregnant
[1:02:34] with Jessica, our first child. We, well,
[1:02:36] we actually lost our first child, but
[1:02:37] Jessica, our second child, and she was
[1:02:39] pregnant with Jessica, and it was on a
[1:02:41] Saturday morning, and I was going to go
[1:02:42] down in the backyard and cut some trees.
[1:02:44] And Cheryl came out on the back porch.
[1:02:46] And she said, "Honey," I said, "Yes."
[1:02:48] She said, "It's time. I I need to go."
[1:02:52] And I said, "Are you sure?" I said,
[1:02:53] "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse
[1:02:55] because you can call them and ask them,
[1:02:57] you know, and they'll tell you whether
[1:02:58] you should come in or not." I said,
[1:02:59] "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse." And
[1:03:01] my wife, God bless her heart, just as
[1:03:03] calm, she goes, "But I am a nurse."
[1:03:10] I said, "Oh yeah, I'll get the bag."
[1:03:18] Oh my, you got to love your wife, you
[1:03:20] know.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; But it was her hour. the the recognition
[1:03:25] that our HOUR HAS COME. THE season of
[1:03:27] fulfillment had come and Jessica was
[1:03:29] born.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Saints, THE HOUR'S COME. ARE YOU READY?
[1:03:34] ARE YOU FEELING THE BULL, THE BIRTH
[1:03:35] PAIN? DO YOU FEEL THAT PULL? WE'VE CAN
[1:03:38] PASS THIS MOUNTAIN LONG ENOUGH. TURN YE
[1:03:40] NORTHWARD. AMEN.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; The hour's come. That's what the church
[1:03:43] is doing today. For Jesus is the word
[1:03:45] and he's the bridegroom and the bride is
[1:03:47] a part of the groom. Therefore, the word
[1:03:49] that is to be fulfilled in this day is
[1:03:51] the same word that was fulfilled in his
[1:03:53] day.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It's the same word, same experience,
[1:03:56] SAME LIFE, SAME WORD, same experience,
[1:03:59] same life.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; What the same mean? It means the same.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Israel's in her homeland. Elijah's done
[1:04:07] come and gone. There's a rapture of the
[1:04:09] church. Amen. THAT IS BONE OF HIS BONE,
[1:04:11] FLESH OF HIS FLESH, WORD OF HIS WORD,
[1:04:13] LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE WILL be him
[1:04:15] expressed. The works he DOES, SHE WILL
[1:04:18] DO ALSO.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a season of recognition. The
[1:04:22] hour has come. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT
[1:04:24] HAPPENED ON SUNSET PEAK on Sunset
[1:04:27] Mountain? LOOK IT UP AND SEE SUNSET PEAK
[1:04:30] ON SUNSET MOUNTAIN. A BLAST FOLLOWED BY
[1:04:33] A CLOUD OF SEVEN ANGELS VINDICATING THAT
[1:04:36] THE MESSAGE WAS RIGHT.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID, "SOON COMETH THE REAL
[1:04:40] RAIN."
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Not just the rain, but the real rain.
[1:04:44] Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; You see why I've been so zealous of the
[1:04:47] kind of seed I planted for the body. The
[1:04:49] rain's going to fall pretty soon. I
[1:04:51] mean, the real rain.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And it's got to have a seed to fall on.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; It's got to have a seed to fall on. I
[1:04:59] hope I live to see it. Do you understand
[1:05:00] now? It'll be the living word. Not the
[1:05:03] written word, but the living word.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; THE WORD MADE FLESH AND LIVING. AMEN.
[1:05:09] THE living word as it was at the
[1:05:11] beginning. THE SPOKEN WORD OF GOD HAVE
[1:05:13] HIS POWER FOR IT IS in him.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; His own body working his own way.
[1:05:19] Looking to the promises THAT GOD GAVE
[1:05:21] THIS BODY.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROMISES THAT GOD GAVE THIS
[1:05:27] BODY.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You see, if you taught Methodist
[1:05:34] message, it wouldn't work for us. It
[1:05:36] takes no effect on us because this is
[1:05:39] not Methodist time. THIS IS BRIDE TIME.
[1:05:41] AMEN.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; If Moses taught the message of Noah, it
[1:05:44] would take no effect. If Jesus taught
[1:05:46] Moses message, it would take no effect.
[1:05:48] The predestinated seed are laying there
[1:05:52] will only be watered by that type of
[1:05:55] water that's given
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; for that seed.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; So, the anointing that falls UPON THE
[1:06:02] BRIDE. IT'S NOT A METHODIST anointing or
[1:06:04] a Lutheran. COME ON, SOMEBODY. BUT IT IS
[1:06:06] AN ANOINTING. AN ANOINTING THAT'LL FALL
[1:06:08] UPON A PREDESTINATED SEED. AND THE SEED
[1:06:10] of the anointing WILL MATCH. AND WHAT
[1:06:12] WILL IT DO? BUT IT'LL BRING FORTH FRUIT
[1:06:14] for his kingdom. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; A tree is known by its fruit.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; The beauty of a tree is NOT THE BRANCH.
[1:06:25] IT'S THE FRUIT.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's given for that seed. It won't
[1:06:32] grow under any condition. It must be the
[1:06:34] condition that grows it. And when you
[1:06:36] see the church getting worldly like it
[1:06:38] was in the days of Sodom,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; you know, like when they're now in the
[1:06:42] church world today,
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; they're allowing trans v.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; They're wearing transsexuals to preach
[1:06:49] the gospel.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; They're having they're having men
[1:06:55] dressed like women teaching Sunday
[1:06:57] school
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; as it was in the days OF SODOM. SO IS IT
[1:07:00] IN THIS DAY. BUT AIN'T IT SOMETHING? ALL
[1:07:03] OF A SUDDEN, EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
[1:07:04] TRANS. A change from one to another.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; If the world's looking at a trans, I'm
[1:07:09] looking at a trans, too.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not changing to a woman, BUT
[1:07:14] CHANGING. OH, HALLELUJAH. CHANGING INTO
[1:07:17] THAT IMAGE GOD HAD OF ME BEFORE THE
[1:07:19] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, SODOM, see the world all
[1:07:26] going into worship the God of this evil
[1:07:28] age. and seeing that and seeing A LITTLE
[1:07:31] MINORITY GROUP gathered under the
[1:07:33] INSPIRATION OF GOD PRODUCING again
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; You see, if a farmer goes and plants his
[1:07:41] seed and covers it up, he must let that
[1:07:44] seed go through the full cycle of
[1:07:46] growth,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Because if he harvestes it any other
[1:07:50] time prior to the maturity of that seed,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; he can never have another crop. So he
[1:07:56] must wait till that seed comes to
[1:07:58] maturity before he harvestes it. And
[1:08:00] once it comes to maturity, he can take
[1:08:02] THAT SEED BECAUSE THAT SEED HAS THE
[1:08:04] ABILITY to reproduce itself again. And
[1:08:07] when will Christ TAKE HIS CHURCH WHEN
[1:08:09] SHE HAS THE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE HIM
[1:08:13] AGAIN ON THE EARTH, MAKING THE
[1:08:15] BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE THE SAME.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, we just came through
[1:08:22] Christmas with three planets lined up.
[1:08:24] It made the announcement of THE
[1:08:25] BRIDEGROOM ON THE EARTH,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; CHRIST on the earth.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; But what did the prophet say? I believe
[1:08:30] it was 1964. I believe it was THAT FIVE
[1:08:33] PLANETS LINED UP. AND WHAT DID THE
[1:08:34] PROPHET SAY? IT WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF
[1:08:36] THE BRIDE ON THE EARTH in infancy.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; But a man don't marry a baby, but he
[1:08:42] must wait till she comes into her
[1:08:44] season. The hour has come for her season
[1:08:47] of love. And when she enters that SEASON
[1:08:49] OF LOVE, SHE CAN reproduce him again.
[1:08:53] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, God. I see it, but I
[1:08:56] want to see it more, Lord.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Producing again the life of Jesus
[1:09:02] CHRIST BY THE SCRIPTURES THAT'S SUPPOSED
[1:09:04] TO HAPPEN. You know what hour that
[1:09:06] you're living in. The Bible fortell by
[1:09:08] prophecy,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; what day that we're living and what time
[1:09:11] we're living and what kind of events
[1:09:13] ought to be taking place. It foretells
[1:09:15] it exactly to the letter.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] Huh? Ain't it something that all of a
[1:09:21] sudden our government is now
[1:09:23] investigating UFOs after all these years
[1:09:26] of people seeing UFO sightings and now
[1:09:29] our government is trying to figure out
[1:09:30] what they are? Well, they could come and
[1:09:32] ask us. We'd have saved them a lot of
[1:09:34] money because we had a prophet to tell
[1:09:36] us that they were investigating angels.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said one day they'll
[1:09:40] drop DOWN AND WHEN THEY GO, YOU'LL GO
[1:09:42] WITH THEM. AMEN.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You see the hour that we're living in,
[1:09:46] friends. Amen. And it'll not miss one
[1:09:48] age. Not one time. It fortells exactly
[1:09:50] to the letter. Has never missed one age
[1:09:52] all the time. Not one time has it ever
[1:09:54] missed and it won't. FOR WHO ARE
[1:09:56] PREDESTINATED TO SEE IT?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Will see it. Jesus said, "No man can
[1:10:01] COME TO ME EXCEPT MY FATHER DRAWS HIM
[1:10:04] FIRST, AND ALL THAT MY FATHER HATH GIVEN
[1:10:07] ME will come."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It's the word joining the word. The word
[1:10:13] joining with the word. It can do nothing
[1:10:15] else. We know it. The day that we're
[1:10:17] living in, the hour has come. The season
[1:10:20] of recognition
[1:10:23] of who I am.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Who I am. Who am I? I'm not a church
[1:10:27] member.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not just a message follower. Don't
[1:10:30] misunderstand me.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But more than that,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; the word becoming flesh, THE PROMISED
[1:10:35] WORD FOR THIS DAY,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; being watered BY AN ANOINTING TO BRING
[1:10:41] FORTH THAT seed to do what? To
[1:10:43] reproduce. Not another church, NOT
[1:10:45] ANOTHER ORGANIZATION, BUT TO reproduce
[1:10:47] Christ.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "A little while the world will
[1:10:51] see me no more, BUT YE SHALL SEE ME."
[1:10:53] HOW, LORD? HOW? FOR I'LL BE WITH YOU,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; even
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the same time, the bride has
[1:11:03] recognized the evening light has just
[1:11:05] began to recognize the hungry
[1:11:06] Pentecostals have began to recognize
[1:11:08] them organizations hasn't got it. And
[1:11:09] the things they're looking for, they're
[1:11:11] so twisted and torup. It's the time of
[1:11:14] recognition. Recognition. You've got to
[1:11:16] recognize. The world has recognized. THE
[1:11:18] NATIONS HAS RECOGNIZED. SCIENCE HAS
[1:11:21] RECOGNIZED. THE DEVIL HAS recognized
[1:11:23] it's a time he can wreck havoc on women,
[1:11:25] wreck the church, WRECK THE PEOPLE. HE'S
[1:11:27] RECOGNIZED IT.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S A
[1:11:32] PEOPLE ON THE EARTH THAT HE
[1:11:34] PREDESTINATED TO LIFE. He's recognized
[1:11:36] it's THE TIME TO SEND HIS MESSAGE. AND
[1:11:39] HE'S DID IT. THE PEOPLE HAS RECOGNIZED
[1:11:42] IT. THE BRIGHT TIME has realized the
[1:11:44] evening light.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet SAID, "THE WORD
[1:11:47] MANIFESTED FOR THAT HOUR IS THE LIGHT OF
[1:11:50] THAT HOUR."
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. THE WORD
[1:11:53] MANIFESTED FOR THAT HOUR IS THE LIGHT OF
[1:11:56] THAT HOUR.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; THEN THE evening light, the evening
[1:12:00] light is just not the name of the
[1:12:02] church.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; The evening light is you.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the light of the
[1:12:08] world." And then he said, "You're the
[1:12:10] light of the world."
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:26, "Even the mystery which
[1:12:19] has been hidden from ages and from
[1:12:22] generations, but now he may has made
[1:12:26] manifest to his saints,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest to his saints."
[1:12:30] It denotes a set time or a season like
[1:12:34] the song Amazing Grace. I once was lost,
[1:12:37] but now
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm found.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known. To whom
[1:12:43] God would make known. To whom God would
[1:12:47] make known what is the riches of the
[1:12:49] glory of this mystery among the
[1:12:51] Gentiles.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Uh that'd be us.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CHRIST IN YOU.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; CHRIST IN YOU.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; THE HOPE.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Of glory.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; The action. You see the action of the
[1:13:04] mystery unfolding. It's causing a
[1:13:06] reaction
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; to those it's unfolding to.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's causing a reaction.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; The mystery unfolding is causing a
[1:13:18] reaction to those that's unfolding to.
[1:13:20] Paul is telling us here in the book OF
[1:13:22] COLOSSIANS THAT GOD HAD THIS GREAT
[1:13:24] MYSTERY HID FROM AGES and from
[1:13:28] generations
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; until a set season or a time
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; that he would make the mystery known.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Now why AFTER AGES AND GENERATIONS WOULD
[1:13:38] ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS MYSTERY THAT GOD
[1:13:40] KEPT IN HIMSELF, WHY WOULD ALL of a
[1:13:43] sudden
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; he would want it to be made known? Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; The mystery, this mystery that he would
[1:13:52] make it known at a set SEASON OR A SET
[1:13:54] TIME. I SAY TO YOU THIS MORNING THAT
[1:13:56] THIS IS THE TIME
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; when the time comes to make known that
[1:14:01] this hidden mystery when it comes time
[1:14:03] to be made known. How would he do it?
[1:14:05] How would he make this mystery known?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Paul tells us in Ephesians 3:3 how that
[1:14:10] by revelation,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:13] By revelation he made known unto me the
[1:14:15] mystery as I wrote a four in few words.
[1:14:17] REVELATION IT EQUALS MANIFESTATION. THE
[1:14:20] PROPHET OF GOD SAID GOD DOES IT AND then
[1:14:22] he reveals it.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He makes the mystery known by
[1:14:26] revelation. IT EQUALS MANIFESTATION. THE
[1:14:29] MANIFESTATION OF THE BRIDE IS THE
[1:14:31] EVIDENCE THAT THE MYSTERY has been
[1:14:32] released.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's secret mystery that he had
[1:14:38] before the world began. Now in THE BACK
[1:14:40] PART OF GOD'S MIND, WE SAID IT
[1:14:42] YESTERDAY. THIS MYSTERY LAID IN THE BACK
[1:14:44] OF GOD'S MIND,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; something that he was trying, he was
[1:14:48] going to achieve. He had a motive in
[1:14:49] doing it. God just don't do something
[1:14:51] just to do it. Everything he does is for
[1:14:53] a purpose.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing it. In order to
[1:14:57] do what? In order to let himself be
[1:14:59] expressed.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; God had this secret in his mind. Nobody
[1:15:03] knew nothing about it. For who had
[1:15:05] access to God's mind? He allowed Moses
[1:15:07] to go back to the beginning. That was as
[1:15:09] far as Moses could go.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; But think of it. Oh God, think of it. In
[1:15:14] this hour that we're living in, HE
[1:15:16] ALLOWED THE PROPHET OF MALACHI 45 AND
[1:15:19] SIX TO GO INTO THE BACK PART OF GOD'S
[1:15:22] MIND
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; TO catch this secret and to reveal it to
[1:15:26] his bride.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Now, why would God suddenly want this
[1:15:31] secret to be made known? A secret that
[1:15:33] he had kept down through the ages and
[1:15:35] generations. There must be somebody on
[1:15:38] the earth now who can receive it. A
[1:15:41] PREDESTINATED CHOSEN BODY OF PEOPLE on
[1:15:44] the earth that knows what he wants done
[1:15:46] with his word. For the PROPHET SAYS
[1:15:48] SHALL HAVE THUS SAYAITH the Lord
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; or keep still.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When a son of God by faith
[1:15:58] takes the word of God into his heart and
[1:16:00] speaks it back up on his lips, it's just
[1:16:03] the same as deity speaking.
[1:16:06] Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we just came through Christmas
[1:16:09] and I don't know how many manger scenes
[1:16:11] I passed with Jesus in a baby in a
[1:16:14] manger. You've seen them. But you know,
[1:16:17] today, if you really want to do an
[1:16:18] accurate PORTRAYAL OF WHERE CHRIST WAS,
[1:16:21] you'd have to go out and lay in the yard
[1:16:22] yourself.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED.
[1:16:35] AMEN. A predestinated chosen body of
[1:16:38] people on the earth that knows what he
[1:16:39] wants DONE WITH HIS WORD. NOT GOD ABOVE
[1:16:42] US. NOT JUST GOD WITH US, BUT GOD IN US,
[1:16:45] THE HOPE OF GLORY. CHRIST IN YOU, CHRIST
[1:16:48] IN ME, THE HOPE OF GLORY.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this, "What
[1:16:54] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:16:56] idols?"
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; The temple of God, the temp, you know,
[1:16:59] the dwelling place of God. Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; What agreement hath the dwelling place
[1:17:04] OF GOD WITH IDOLS? FOR YE ARE THE TEMPLE
[1:17:07] of the living God,
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; as God hath said, I will dwell in them
[1:17:12] and walk in them, AND I WILL BE THEIR
[1:17:14] GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE. Notice
[1:17:17] that God's desire is not just to be with
[1:17:19] his people. But he wants to be in his
[1:17:22] people.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; For he said, I will not DWELL WITH THEM,
[1:17:25] BUT I WILL DWELL IN THEM. AND I WILL NOT
[1:17:27] WALK WITH THEM, BUT I WILL WALK IN THEM.
[1:17:30] AMEN.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; God the creator walking in his creation.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T STAGGER INTO THIS MESSAGE,
[1:17:43] FRIENDS. GOD PREDESTINATED YOU
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; FOR this time. The hour has come. The
[1:17:49] season
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; of recognition.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; This season, this hour, THIS TIME, BRIDE
[1:17:54] TIME.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET NEVER EVEN SAID BRIDE TIME
[1:17:57] TO THE LATER part of 60s. 64 I believe
[1:18:00] it was something like that the middle of
[1:18:01] ' 64 that he started talking about a
[1:18:03] bride time.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; God wanted to EXPRESS HIMSELF IN A BODY
[1:18:08] of believers called the bride.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; The the manifested Christ in you.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. The great manifested
[1:18:19] God in Christ. Now Christ manifested in
[1:18:23] you.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] Look, what was once God's great secret,
[1:18:28] God's great mysterious secret in his
[1:18:30] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:18:34] believers. That is the body of Christ.
[1:18:37] What was God's once great secret in his
[1:18:39] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:18:41] is now made manifest. Now, WHERE WHERE
[1:18:45] IS IT MADE MANIFEST? In you.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] You remember the Welch revival? And they
[1:18:56] went over to find out this revival, to
[1:18:58] find out what's going on. And they saw a
[1:19:00] policeman standing on the street corner
[1:19:01] and they went to that policeman to find
[1:19:04] out where the Welch revival was. Now, I
[1:19:06] want you to understand, they didn't go
[1:19:07] to the policeman and ask directions
[1:19:09] because he was a policeman.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And when they went to him and said,
[1:19:13] "Sir, WHERE IS THE WELCH REVIVAL?" HE
[1:19:15] NEVER SAID, "GO two blocks, turn right,
[1:19:17] turn left, there's a library. Behind the
[1:19:18] library, there's a storefront. That's
[1:19:20] where you'll find it." He never GAVE
[1:19:21] THEM A GPS LOCATION.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; But when they said, "SIR, WE'RE HUNGRY.
[1:19:27] WHERE IS THE WELCH REVIVAL?" YOU KNOW
[1:19:29] WHAT HE SAID? YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; NOW, why did they go TO HIM? NOT BECAUSE
[1:19:35] he is a policeman, BUT HE WAS STANDING
[1:19:37] ON THE STREET CORNER SINGING A GOSPEL
[1:19:40] SONG.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't talking about the
[1:19:44] revival. HE WAS MANIFESTING THE REVIVAL.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TALK
[1:19:50] ABOUT THE TOKEN. YOU MUST NOW APPLY THE
[1:19:53] TOKEN.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:58] AMEN. OH, do you love him?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Where is it made manifest? In his bride.
[1:20:05] Then God would manifest in one man. God
[1:20:08] would manifest in one man. Now he's
[1:20:10] manifested in an entire church universal
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; all over the world. The body of Christ
[1:20:18] is represented all over the world. And
[1:20:20] what does that do? It makes St. John
[1:20:21] 14:12 and it vindicates it to be the
[1:20:23] truth. For Jesus said, "The works I do
[1:20:25] shall you do also, and greater works
[1:20:27] than this shall you do." Now, you can't
[1:20:29] do nothing greater that open blinded
[1:20:30] eyes and raised the dead. So, what was
[1:20:32] he saying? All the things that took
[1:20:34] place in Jesus day, it was in his body,
[1:20:36] ONE MAN DOING THESE MIRACLES. BUT NOW,
[1:20:39] it's a universal BRIDE AROUND THE WORLD
[1:20:41] and over in Africa and down in South
[1:20:43] Africa and down in Tennessee AND HERE IN
[1:20:45] GEORGIA. GOD IS DOING GREAT THINGS. WHY?
[1:20:47] IT'S A UNIVERSAL BRIDE. MORE WORKS
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE it's a many member bride.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And say, look, if I'm the if I'm the
[1:20:58] foot of the body of this bride, if I'm
[1:21:02] his body represent and I'm the foot, if
[1:21:04] I'm the bottom, if I where the little
[1:21:06] toe meets the foot and that if that's
[1:21:08] what I am, I'm still in the body.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] But even if that's who I am, if that's
[1:21:15] who I am IN THE BODY OF CHRIST, EVERY
[1:21:17] DEVIL IS STILL UNDER MY FEET.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; LOWER. LOWER. Stomp Satan. Lower.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wouldn't manifest in one man.
[1:21:30] Now he's manifested in the entire church
[1:21:32] universal. EVERYWHERE. GOD CAN WORK
[1:21:34] THROUGH EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; that'll open up their heart
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; and let the Lord Jesus come in and work
[1:21:41] his will through them.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; The days of the voice of the seventh
[1:21:46] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:21:48] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:21:51] hath declared to his servants the
[1:21:53] prophets.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; How did he Can I have just a few more
[1:21:59] minutes? Look, how did he identify the
[1:22:01] bridegroom on the earth? He sent a
[1:22:03] messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon
[1:22:06] him.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Then how will he how will he announce
[1:22:09] the bride on the earth? It'll be a be a
[1:22:11] messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon
[1:22:13] him.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; For the same word speaks for the groom
[1:22:16] SPEAKS ALSO FOR THE BRIDE.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; LOOK, last year we had a eclipse.
[1:22:22] Remember I think it was around April the
[1:22:23] 10th we had an eclipse and I was down in
[1:22:25] Hardy, Arkansas because that's where it
[1:22:26] was a 100%. And if you're at a 100%
[1:22:29] where the eclipse is, it's total
[1:22:30] darkness. So we preached a meeting down
[1:22:32] there and then on that Monday we stood
[1:22:34] over to watch the eclipse. And when it
[1:22:36] when that moon and that sun became one,
[1:22:38] it was total darkness where we were
[1:22:40] standing.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Turkeys begin to gobble. Roosters was
[1:22:43] roosting.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; It's the craziest thing you ever seen.
[1:22:45] You could look out on the horizon and
[1:22:46] see light, but right there where we was
[1:22:48] at WAS DARKNESS.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; AND AS I STOOD THERE, you know, you
[1:22:51] couldn't had to have these special
[1:22:52] glasses, but once the moon covered the
[1:22:54] sun, you could take the glasses off and
[1:22:55] just look at it. It was phenomenal. How
[1:22:57] many knows what I'm talking about? It
[1:22:58] came through here a few years ago. And I
[1:23:01] was standing there looking at that moon.
[1:23:03] Now, the prophet said the moon is the
[1:23:04] type of the church and the sun is the
[1:23:06] type of Christ.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I It just struck me.
[1:23:08] I got so happy that when the moon and
[1:23:11] the sun become one, there was darkness
[1:23:14] on the earth.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; When Christ and his church becomes one,
[1:23:21] it's in the Leosa age. Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; The age of gross darkness when the two
[1:23:28] become one.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COMING. I TELL
[1:23:32] YOU, IT'S HERE.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:40] AMEN. The mystery of God should be
[1:23:41] finished and declared to his servants,
[1:23:42] the prophets. Therefore, the entire
[1:23:44] Bible is the revelation of God's MYSTERY
[1:23:46] IN CHRIST. MARY was a human incubator.
[1:23:48] She carried the holy child and brought
[1:23:50] him to birth. It was a God man. He was
[1:23:52] the son of God. He was a new creation.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He was the first of a new race.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; He is the head of the new race. Well, if
[1:24:09] there's a head, there got to be a body.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; What good's a body without a head? What
[1:24:14] good's a head without a body?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] He's the head of a new race. And he's
[1:24:24] the head of the body of the church, who
[1:24:26] is the beginning, THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE
[1:24:28] DEAD, THAT IN ALL THINGS HE MIGHT HAVE
[1:24:31] THE PREEMINENCE. THEREFORE, if any man
[1:24:34] be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old
[1:24:37] things have passed away. Behold, all
[1:24:39] things are come become new. There can
[1:24:41] see though that that the old man was of
[1:24:43] the old order of a creation. NOW IN
[1:24:46] UNION WITH CHRIST, HE HAS BECOME a new
[1:24:49] creation of God.
[1:24:52] You see, Satan has no ability to create.
[1:24:54] He can pervert, but he can't create.
[1:24:56] ONLY GOD CAN CREATE. SO, this new race
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; must come from the creator.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Created in union with Christ Jesus, unto
[1:25:07] good works,
[1:25:10] oh God. Ephesians 4:24. and that ye put
[1:25:13] on the new man
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; which after God is created in
[1:25:16] righteousness
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; and true holiness.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; A season when the head and the body
[1:25:25] unites.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, do you see the hours come?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; This is who we are. We've come into a
[1:25:32] new year.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of the manifestation of
[1:25:37] who we are.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; We don't have to pump it up. We don't
[1:25:40] have to work it up. We just live it.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; You just live it. It'll manifest itself
[1:25:46] through you.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; A new creation, a new race.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; A God man.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said Jesus was all man. He
[1:25:58] was all God. He was a man when he wept
[1:26:00] in the garden.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; But when he threw his shoulders back and
[1:26:03] said, "Lazarus, come forth." That was
[1:26:04] MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A MAN WHEN HE'S SLEEPING ON THE
[1:26:07] BOAT, TIRED FROM PREACHING. BUT WHEN HE
[1:26:09] PUT HIS FOOT ON THE BOW OF THE BOAT AND
[1:26:11] SAID, "PEACE BE STILL." THAT WAS GOD IN
[1:26:13] A MAN.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE, my brother, my sister,
[1:26:16] that's what his desire has been all
[1:26:17] along.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; To walk in us
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; to live in us. For what is true
[1:26:23] fellowship? Two fellows
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; in the same ship.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Can you see it, my brother, my sister?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; God, help us this morning.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us this morning. And what
[1:26:39] does it take?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; What does it take for this to manifest
[1:26:42] in us? A surrendered life.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just something yielded.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Something yielded that he can work his
[1:26:52] work through. As I said yesterday, God
[1:26:55] don't need something big. He just needs
[1:26:58] something yielded.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him today?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see your hour?
[1:27:08] Don't you see the critics rising up?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; It's the season for it.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Look, I I'll close with this, but look,
[1:27:15] when Jesus was here and he started his
[1:27:18] ministry, the Bible says he was
[1:27:20] glorified by all.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Is that not true?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; In three years and six months, it come
[1:27:27] from being glorified by all to the point
[1:27:29] they hated him
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; till they killed him. That's
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; right. in a short season.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; They went from loving him to hating him
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; to criticizing him to calling him a
[1:27:39] devil and a false prophet.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his
[1:27:45] message.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; But what came next? The resurrection.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. that we're living in
[1:27:53] an hour that all of a sudden I've been
[1:27:55] in this message a long time, but I have
[1:27:57] never seen this message abused and
[1:27:59] criticized
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; than it is right now.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; This believe the sign and all these
[1:28:05] things that people are doing and all
[1:28:06] this hate and all this and that if I
[1:28:08] don't know if you saw it or not, but
[1:28:09] somebody went up to brother Bram's grave
[1:28:10] and wrote all kinds of nasty words on
[1:28:12] it. Did you see that? Desseecrated his
[1:28:14] grave. It's the hour that we're living
[1:28:17] in. Don't you see the final rejection of
[1:28:19] his word is his bride? And when they
[1:28:22] reject this bride,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; what comes next?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The rapture.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you see where we're at in time,
[1:28:29] friends? It's here. The season is here.
[1:28:32] The time has come.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; I feel the birth pains.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I feel the going home pains.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you ready?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; There's Listen, listen to me, young
[1:28:45] people. There is nothing. There is
[1:28:47] nothing in this nation worth missing
[1:28:49] this rapture over.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; There's not enough money. There's not
[1:28:53] enough.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Get under his wings.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Hide yourself under his wings. The hour
[1:29:02] has come in a little while. Oh my. Let's
[1:29:06] be ready.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; God, give me more love.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Give me more power. More of you
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; in my life. Do you love him today?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him today?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; God sent this message to find you.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah, "They shall be
[1:29:24] called the sought out."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; The sought out.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; We shall be called the sought out.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Who do you reckon's looking for us?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom looking for
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Oh, God. May the Lord bless
[1:29:43] you. Let's bow our heads.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:29:50] Oh God, how I love you, Lord. How I feel
[1:29:54] your presence on me, Lord.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] More love,
[1:30:01] more power,
[1:30:04] more of you in my life.
[1:30:10] More love. More
[1:30:13] power,
[1:30:15] more of you in my life. And I will
[1:30:19] worship you with all of my heart. And I
[1:30:24] will worship you with all of my mind.
[1:30:29] And I will worship you with all of my
[1:30:33] strength. For you are my Lord.
[1:30:38] Lord,
[1:30:41] more love,
[1:30:44] more power,
[1:30:46] more of you in my life.
[1:30:51] More love,
[1:30:54] more power,
[1:30:57] more of you in my life. And I will
[1:31:01] worship you with all of my heart. And I
[1:31:06] will worship you with all of my mind.
[1:31:10] And I will worship you with all of my
[1:31:14] strength.
[1:31:16] For you are my Lord.
[1:31:22] Oh Lord Jesus.
[1:31:25] God, it's our hunger today, God.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want the world, Lord.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; We don't want the world order. We don't
[1:31:31] want the things of the world. It's you
[1:31:34] we hunger for, Lord. That anointing,
[1:31:36] that real rain that is to fall upon us
[1:31:39] to bring forth fruit. Oh God, help us,
[1:31:42] Lord God, in this hour when everything
[1:31:44] is turning against us. Lord, yet you
[1:31:47] said, "I'll never leave thee, nor will I
[1:31:48] forsake thee." Yay, though I walk
[1:31:50] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:31:52] death, I will be with you. Oh God, we
[1:31:55] are so grateful, Lord, of this hour that
[1:31:57] these mysteries, these great things that
[1:31:59] you hid in your mind, Lord, has now been
[1:32:01] placed into our hearts that we may
[1:32:03] manifest it back upon our flesh that the
[1:32:05] world may know you're the same
[1:32:07] yesterday, today, and forever. I'm so
[1:32:09] glad my children don't have to go back
[1:32:11] to 65 and find you doing miracles and
[1:32:13] signs and wonders. But today, the hour
[1:32:15] that we're LIVING IN, MY CHILDREN are
[1:32:17] witness of miracles and signs and
[1:32:19] wonders and these things. Lord, we don't
[1:32:21] seek after them. We don't follow signs,
[1:32:23] but they do follow us, Lord God. And we
[1:32:25] are grateful today to be a part of the
[1:32:28] economy of God. And Lord, as we come
[1:32:30] into this new year, God, let this be the
[1:32:32] year of consecration, of more
[1:32:33] dedication, of service, Lord, to lay
[1:32:35] into your presence, to ripen in the
[1:32:37] presence of the sun. Oh God, grant it,
[1:32:40] Lord. Bless this church. Let a revival
[1:32:42] strike this church, LORD. LET IT STRIKE
[1:32:44] this little community of Lula, Lord.
[1:32:46] that'll strike this PART OF GEORGIA THAT
[1:32:48] THAT LAST seed can be found, Lord,
[1:32:50] because we know when that last one comes
[1:32:52] in, you'll close the book and call for
[1:32:54] your bride. Oh, Father, until then, let
[1:32:57] us labor, Lord. Oh, Father, let us
[1:32:59] labor. God, we don't have to manifest
[1:33:01] the light, but let us bear that light,
[1:33:03] Lord Jesus. Let it reflect through us,
[1:33:05] Lord, that the world may know that
[1:33:08] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:10] forever. Bless your children today,
[1:33:12] Lord. We pray if you're here, friends.
[1:33:14] If that's your desire today, why don't
[1:33:16] you just lift your hands up to him and
[1:33:18] say, "Lord, Lord, this new year, God, I
[1:33:20] want to rededicate. I want to
[1:33:22] reconsecrate myself to you, Lord. Oh,
[1:33:24] Father, many walked away this year, but
[1:33:26] I'm still here, Lord. I'm still
[1:33:28] believing, oh God. I lift my heads to
[1:33:30] you, Lord, today. More love, more power,
[1:33:34] more of you in my life, oh God. That's
[1:33:36] what I need, God. That's all I need,
[1:33:38] Lord. That's all I need, Lord, is you,
[1:33:41] God. Come today, Lord. I open up my
[1:33:44] heart to you. I receive it today, Lord,
[1:33:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I
[1:33:49] pray for those that are afflicted today.
[1:33:50] The sick that are among us in the name
[1:33:53] of Jesus. May the anointing of God move
[1:33:55] upon them today, Lord. Let the sickness
[1:33:57] leave them. Let the affliction leave
[1:33:59] them. Let the weariness leave them. Let
[1:34:01] the oppression and the depression, let
[1:34:03] it leave them today in the name OF JESUS
[1:34:05] CHRIST. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN OF DARKNESS.
[1:34:07] WE ARE THE children of light. Amen. And
[1:34:10] we are your people. You are our God.
[1:34:12] Amen. We are your people. We are your
[1:34:15] people and you are our God. And we love
[1:34:18] you, Lord. And we worship you, God. And
[1:34:20] we receive you today in the name of
[1:34:23] Jesus. Oh God, bless Brother Way, Lord.
[1:34:25] Use him, God. Use him for your glory.
[1:34:27] Anoint these other ministers here, Lord,
[1:34:29] as they travel through Central America,
[1:34:31] different parts of the world. Use them,
[1:34:32] oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus. Oh
[1:34:36] God, may we not have to point to
[1:34:38] somewhere where the revival is, but may
[1:34:41] we be like that POLICEMAN AND SAY WE ARE
[1:34:43] THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL. Oh God, not just a
[1:34:46] rain, but the real rain. Oh God, the
[1:34:49] real rain to a vindicate that the
[1:34:52] message is right. Grant it Lord God.
[1:34:55] Grant it Lord in Jesus name we pray.

[1:36:25] the highest star
[1:36:31] and reaches
[1:36:33] to
[1:36:37] the Lord.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:37:07] child.

[1:37:17] and pardon us
[1:37:23] from sin.
[1:37:28] Oh love of God,
[1:37:34] how rich in everybody
[1:37:41] land.
[1:37:45] and strong.
[1:37:50] It shall forever
[1:37:56] more
[1:37:58] endure
[1:38:01] the saints and angels
[1:38:08] to all. Sing it to him. Worship him.
[1:38:14] of God. Love of God, how rich and pure,
[1:38:23] how measureless.
[1:38:29] Amen. And strong.
[1:38:34] reach out forever
[1:38:40] more
[1:38:42] endure
[1:38:45] the saints
[1:38:47] and a
[1:38:51] shallow.
[1:38:55] Amen. Brother Joe, let's sing more of
[1:38:58] you. Can you hear more of you? We got
[1:39:02] more of you. More of you. more of you.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; A second before.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:08] Uh we got more of you on the on the uh
[1:39:13] on the list.
[1:39:15] More of you. I want more of you. Is that
[1:39:18] our Is that our prayer? Is that our
[1:39:20] plea? I want more preaching like I want
[1:39:24] to hear. The only way you going to hear
[1:39:26] right there
[1:39:28] more of you today, this hour, this day
[1:39:33] is the day of salvation. This is the day
[1:39:36] that's coming. Noah was preaching 120
[1:39:40] years. And like I said the other day, he
[1:39:42] expected it to rain.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Well, his expectation came to pass.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; It did rain.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what about it, though? Only
[1:39:51] eight people went in.
[1:39:54] 120 years. Brother Daryl, sometimes we
[1:39:57] get disappointed because people don't
[1:40:00] want to hear us. What about preaching
[1:40:02] for 120 years the same message and you
[1:40:04] get no results except one day God comes
[1:40:06] on the scene and says, "Get in the ark."
[1:40:09] This is all that's going to hear me.
[1:40:11] This is it. And that's what's going to
[1:40:12] happen. When we come to this day that
[1:40:15] God's going to shut the door on the
[1:40:16] Gentile church, there'll be no one else
[1:40:19] saved. That'll be it. Whoever's in's in.
[1:40:22] Whoever's out is out. Everybody with me?
[1:40:26] Every person has got a seat on that ark.
[1:40:31] If you will
[1:40:34] expect that you have a seat on that ark,
[1:40:38] God's given us a way.
[1:40:41] And through preaching, through
[1:40:43] fellowshipping, I cannot see how
[1:40:46] somebody would sit at home and try to
[1:40:49] make have a service. I just can't see
[1:40:51] that.
[1:40:52] We are sheep. We need to be together. We
[1:40:54] need fellowship. We need to feed off
[1:40:56] each other. Everybody with me? Feed off
[1:40:59] each other. The highs, the lows, the ins
[1:41:02] and outs, the ups and downs. Sometimes,
[1:41:05] you know, you may be up and your brother
[1:41:07] and sister may be down. Or you may be
[1:41:09] down and your brother and sister may be
[1:41:11] up. Well, that's why we bind together
[1:41:14] and we bring everybody into the fold and
[1:41:17] we try our best to love God with all of
[1:41:19] our heart. But you know how to love.
[1:41:21] It's just like brotherh Manuel was
[1:41:23] saying today.
[1:41:25] They asked Jesus. They said, "What's the
[1:41:28] two of the greatest commandments,
[1:41:31] right?" He said, "Love the Lord thy God
[1:41:33] with all thy heart and love thy neighbor
[1:41:37] as thyself." These are two of the
[1:41:38] greatest commandments. Why? Because if
[1:41:40] you can love your brother
[1:41:43] or your neighbor as much as you do you,
[1:41:46] you're doing a good thing.
[1:41:49] Think about that. Love your neighbor
[1:41:52] just as you love yourself.
[1:41:55] That's the love of God.
[1:41:58] Can we say it now?
[1:42:02] What I need is more of you.
[1:42:11] I've had
[1:42:15] but yet I hunger still worshiping.
[1:42:20] There's a wonderful atmosphere today.
[1:42:22] Get what you need. Get it today
[1:42:27] for more of you. You sing it to me. Let
[1:42:31] that be your desire.
[1:42:33] More.
[1:42:35] Yes. More of you.
[1:42:38] I want more of you.
[1:42:44] Oh, I've had it all,
[1:42:48] but what I need is more of you.
[1:42:56] Hey, listen. I've had enough of this
[1:42:58] world. I've had my fill of this world. I
[1:43:02] want the heavenly things that God has
[1:43:04] got for us and to give us right now.
[1:43:09] Heavenly places
[1:43:11] while we're still standing in hell.
[1:43:14] What a miracle. Sing it to him. You're a
[1:43:17] miracle where you're standing today. I
[1:43:19] want more of you.
[1:43:22] Grant it, Lord. I want more of you.
[1:43:31] I I've had it all,
[1:43:34] but what I need is more of you.
[1:43:40] Oh, sing it to him. Of things I've had
[1:43:45] in my field.
[1:43:47] Oh, but yet I hunger still.
[1:43:53] Here we are, empty and bare. Lord, hear
[1:43:57] my prayer for more of you. One more
[1:44:02] time, sing it to him.
[1:44:04] I want more of you. Let that be your
[1:44:08] prayer.
[1:44:10] I want more of you.
[1:44:16] Oh, I've had it all, but what I need is
[1:44:22] more of you. Yes, Lord. Amen. Grant it.
[1:44:27] of things I've had my fear.
[1:44:33] But yet I hunger still
[1:44:39] empty and bad.
[1:44:42] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:44:49] Amen.
[1:44:51] God wants to have the preeminence. The
[1:44:53] only way you can have the preeminence is
[1:44:55] to have more of him.
[1:44:58] You remember you know what preeminence
[1:44:59] is? Preeminence mean you put him before
[1:45:03] everything else. And that's what he
[1:45:06] that's why I want you to read Christ the
[1:45:08] mystery of God revealed. And he he
[1:45:09] quoted about three pages of it just a
[1:45:11] few minutes ago if you're realizing it.
[1:45:13] That's where he was uh he was preaching
[1:45:15] from. So, but we're going to um we're
[1:45:18] going to start there because if listen,
[1:45:19] if we don't know that it's Christ in us,
[1:45:23] you'll never know what a seal is.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be sealed out of any revelation
[1:45:28] without the seal of God in your heart.
[1:45:32] And that's just the way God works. But
[1:45:34] you know what? God said, I'm going to do
[1:45:35] it in simplicity. I'm going to let a
[1:45:37] seventh grade prophet
[1:45:40] that can't hardly speak good English.
[1:45:43] I'm going to send it through him so that
[1:45:45] every person little or big can
[1:45:48] understand what he's saying and make it
[1:45:50] so simple
[1:45:52] that even the common people. Now listen,
[1:45:55] the son of man ministry was what? Jesus
[1:45:57] Christ on earth in in human flesh. And
[1:46:00] the Bible said the common people heard
[1:46:03] him gladly.
[1:46:05] Not the hierarchy, not even the
[1:46:07] religious world. The common people heard
[1:46:10] him gladly. And that's us. We're just
[1:46:12] common people. But we got a message
[1:46:15] that's so powerful. One day it's going
[1:46:17] to absolutely change your body. And the
[1:46:20] words that you speak out of your mouth
[1:46:22] is going to raise the dead.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; The word you're going to speak. I was
[1:46:28] thinking as brother brother Daryl was
[1:46:29] was was speaking, I thought, Lord,
[1:46:32] you're in his mind and he's speaking
[1:46:34] what you told him to what you told him
[1:46:36] to speak. But it's happening in a split
[1:46:38] second.
[1:46:40] I mean, a split second.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; In the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:46:46] eye, we're going to be changed. Listen,
[1:46:50] why not start now a little bit at a
[1:46:51] time? Let's change a little bit at a
[1:46:54] time. And then one day, we're going to
[1:46:56] be changed and got and raptured out of
[1:46:58] this place.
[1:47:01] Tell Brother Daryl how much you
[1:47:02] appreciate it. Very timely message. Very
[1:47:04] wonderful message. Very timely. And we
[1:47:06] sure appreciate him. Like I said before,
[1:47:08] he he us he starts our year out.
[1:47:10] Wonderful. And just pray for him as he
[1:47:13] heads back home and and up there with
[1:47:15] brother Donnie and helps him out. Puts
[1:47:17] his shoulder to the wheel there and and
[1:47:19] uh he's been to Lord, he's been to 30
[1:47:21] something countries. I don't know if
[1:47:22] some of you know his testimony, but he
[1:47:24] went to the he got in the army to see
[1:47:25] the world and they put him in like Fort
[1:47:27] Bragg uh North Carolina or somewhere and
[1:47:30] he never got out overseas. But now since
[1:47:32] he got in the right army,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; since he got in the right army 30 years
[1:47:36] ago, he's been in 30 something different
[1:47:38] countries and and they're calling him
[1:47:40] all the time wanting him to go to those
[1:47:42] countries. So God works in mysterious
[1:47:45] ways. Amen. God bless you. Love you with
[1:47:48] the love of the Lord. Remember the uh
[1:47:50] Yes.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Can I get a pray for
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Come on.
[1:48:03] Now, Brother Roger is
[1:48:06] Sister Cleleta's
[1:48:08] son-in-law, okay? He's married to Chi.
[1:48:11] And uh actually, I talked to Lauren the
[1:48:13] other day. She's doing okay. Trying to
[1:48:16] get her to come to church, but he has uh
[1:48:18] he's going to have open heart surgery.
[1:48:19] Now, this is one man standing here
[1:48:20] today. How many of y'all had open heart
[1:48:22] surgery? I didn't think so.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; This one has.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Canard,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; and he's went through it. and Anna
[1:48:29] Canard already has at home, but he knows
[1:48:31] more than anything the struggle
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; of an open heart surgery. So, we're
[1:48:35] going to pray.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray number one that God
[1:48:38] will touch his soul.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Heal his soul first. Give me my heart
[1:48:42] transplant.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; I fish with the fish, not for fish.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; That's fish for him. Fishers of men.
[1:48:47] That's right. Well, we're going to pray
[1:48:49] that God's going to change him and then
[1:48:51] help the doctors if he has to go through
[1:48:53] it just like we did with brother Boyd.
[1:48:55] Bless those hands, Lord. Let's pray.
[1:48:56] Dear heavenly father, Lord, where our
[1:48:58] brother stands here today. Lord, we know
[1:49:01] brother Roger, Lord, and we've known him
[1:49:03] for a while. Father, I pray that you
[1:49:04] would be with him and bless him. He's a
[1:49:06] wonderful man to be around. Father, we
[1:49:08] pray that you'd touch his heart, Lord,
[1:49:10] the real heart, the one that the
[1:49:11] doctor's not going to touch, but Dr.
[1:49:13] Jesus, you can touch his real heart. And
[1:49:16] Father, I pray that you'd be with the
[1:49:17] doctors as they perform the surgery,
[1:49:19] Lord. And that he'll come out of it,
[1:49:21] Lord, and be a better person, Father.
[1:49:23] Lord, show him as maybe this is
[1:49:25] something to tell him that he needs to
[1:49:27] get right with you, Father, and that
[1:49:29] that will happen, Lord. And our brother,
[1:49:30] Lord, I pray that you give Brother Boyd
[1:49:31] and ones that hang around him, Lord, the
[1:49:33] the wisdom to speak the words to him,
[1:49:35] Lord, that he'll come back to you,
[1:49:37] Father. I pray these things in Jesus
[1:49:39] name. Amen. Believe that you just hang
[1:49:42] around him.
[1:49:44] Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You know, God will let somebody go
[1:49:49] through
[1:49:50] something.
[1:49:52] so that they can be a witness for
[1:49:54] another person.
[1:49:56] Could have let brother Boyd go through
[1:49:58] this. You think, "Boy, that's horrible."
[1:50:01] That's the way my God works.
[1:50:05] Amen. He'll let you go through a trial
[1:50:07] and a tribulation just so you can be
[1:50:09] what? An example
[1:50:11] and be a testimony of the test that you
[1:50:14] took. So sometimes we uh Paul says, "I
[1:50:18] glory in my infirmity." Why? because he
[1:50:20] wanted to show the people that God could
[1:50:21] heal you of anything.
[1:50:24] That's what um I'll tell you this real
[1:50:27] quick what brother u um Daryl was
[1:50:32] telling about me about the surgery. This
[1:50:33] man, his his bowels had blown up and he
[1:50:36] was just absolutely
[1:50:38] gone. They had to take big sections of
[1:50:40] it out and and he had, you know, all
[1:50:42] kind of infection and all that stuff and
[1:50:44] they opened him up and and brother Daryl
[1:50:46] said he was standing in the in the
[1:50:48] operating room and he's like something
[1:50:51] came over him.
[1:50:53] You know what the doctor stood there and
[1:50:56] said he will never make it. He is not
[1:50:58] going to live.
[1:51:01] And brother Daryl was in his mind. He
[1:51:03] was thinking, you know, boy, this is bad
[1:51:04] because he's looking he's looking at
[1:51:06] this man's whole insides is completely
[1:51:08] rotten.
[1:51:09] He said something came over him and
[1:51:10] said, "Is there anything
[1:51:13] too hard for God?"
[1:51:17] And that man lived 10 more years.
[1:51:18] Brother Daryl prayed with him and and
[1:51:20] I'm sure he, you know, just being in
[1:51:22] Listen, being in the room with a
[1:51:24] believer sometimes is the greatest thing
[1:51:26] you'll ever have. Hello, somebody. You
[1:51:29] say, "Well, I don't feel that way." Hey,
[1:51:30] well, you better get something in your
[1:51:32] heart to feel that way. Amen. Cuz
[1:51:34] believers love believers.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We love our believers. We love the
[1:51:39] people that believe with us. And as we
[1:51:42] stand, as we stand today as the bride of
[1:51:44] Jesus Christ, as he said back there, we
[1:51:46] are going to be an invincible army.
[1:51:50] Satan will not be able to stand against
[1:51:52] this bride.
[1:51:54] I believe that cuz I'm a believer.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it looks bad." Who who
[1:51:59] asked you about what he looked like
[1:52:02] when Jesus Christ hung on the cross?
[1:52:03] That was the worst, awful, pitiful thing
[1:52:05] you could ever see in your life. But it
[1:52:07] was the greatest thing that ever
[1:52:08] happened.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; He was beginning
[1:52:12] to be the what? Firstborn from the dead.
[1:52:15] The beginning of the creation of God.
[1:52:16] The beginning of this new race. You and
[1:52:18] I are a part of that new race.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Today we are. That's what we're going to
[1:52:23] be speaking on. He didn't know that in a
[1:52:25] couple weeks cuz you're part of this. If
[1:52:27] you're not a part of this new race, then
[1:52:29] you're not going to understand the
[1:52:30] seals. But the seals are for you. The
[1:52:32] seals, as as brother Richard Wilson
[1:52:35] said, this message is summed up in one
[1:52:37] sentence.
[1:52:40] God and man are one.
[1:52:44] That's what brother Brandham wanted us
[1:52:46] to see was that God and man was one. Not
[1:52:49] God and man too. God and man was one.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:52:57] Christ. That makes us God made manifest
[1:52:59] in another form. I didn't make myself
[1:53:01] that. God did. God said he'd have
[1:53:04] somebody stand on the earth that would
[1:53:05] believe him. So, he had to send us a
[1:53:07] prophet to turn us into the right
[1:53:10] direction. And I believe he has. I
[1:53:12] believe we're heading in the right
[1:53:13] direction. So, God bless you. Love you
[1:53:14] with the love of the Lord. Let's bow our
[1:53:16] heads and be dismissed. Just remember
[1:53:18] us. They're coming up here Wednesday and
[1:53:20] and then regular service next Sunday and
[1:53:22] it will be probably regular for the next
[1:53:25] uh until uh February when we have the
[1:53:27] banquet with brother Eric here. Uh we'll
[1:53:29] be speaking a good bit because we want
[1:53:31] to bring out some things on the seals
[1:53:33] that will help us through the year. So
[1:53:34] dear heavenly father, Lord, thank you
[1:53:36] for this day. Lord, I pray number one
[1:53:38] for our servant, Lord, that spoke to us
[1:53:40] today. That you'd give him strength,
[1:53:41] Father. That you would give him, Lord,
[1:53:44] um safe travel back home, Lord. And that
[1:53:46] you will bless each person that's in
[1:53:48] this building, Lord. That we've received
[1:53:49] something today from an eternal God. And
[1:53:52] I pray, Lord, that it will become part
[1:53:53] of us and we'll live it, Father, instead
[1:53:55] of just trying to remember it. Lord,
[1:53:57] we'll live it. It'll live through each
[1:53:59] and every one of us, Father. Just be
[1:54:01] with the ones that are sick, the ones
[1:54:02] that are not here, Sister Rebecca, and
[1:54:03] different ones that that sickness has
[1:54:05] come upon. And I pray that you'd break
[1:54:06] that spirit, Father. That you would
[1:54:08] break us, Lord, that spirit of there,
[1:54:10] Lord. I didn't mention, but Terrence and
[1:54:12] Lisa and all them, they have the they
[1:54:14] have the um bug and stomach bug. And
[1:54:17] Father, I pray that you'd that you'd
[1:54:19] bless them, Father, right now in the
[1:54:20] name of the Lord Jesus, that you'd take
[1:54:22] all that away from each one, Lord, cuz
[1:54:24] we've all been through that and we're a
[1:54:25] witness so we can enter in, Lord, and
[1:54:27] ask you, Lord, that you would take them,
[1:54:30] Lord, and and raise our body up, Lord,
[1:54:31] get rid of that virus in all of us. I
[1:54:34] pray that that you would bless each one
[1:54:36] now. Lord, heal the sick.
[1:54:41] Lord, I mean the sin sick. Lord, it's
[1:54:44] time
[1:54:45] that Noah preached. It's going to rain.
[1:54:49] Well, as our brother said, the prophet
[1:54:50] of God brought us a message and now the
[1:54:54] real rain is beginning to fall. Father,
[1:54:56] be with us now as we continue on home
[1:54:59] and we come back together on Wednesday
