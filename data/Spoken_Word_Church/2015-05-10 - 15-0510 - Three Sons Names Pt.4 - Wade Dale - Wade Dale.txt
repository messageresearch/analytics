TRANSCRIPT
========================================
demo mode we're recording man yeah all right that's john 1. in the beginning was uh logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god amen amen everybody enjoying this so far have i lost anybody because if i have i don't want to i don't want to lose anybody on the way through this i want us to i'm still thinking um and i may do it upstairs uh preach the sermons preach the sermon preach the sermon on the logo all right well now what but i want it now but i remember what i'm still i'm still thinking more on the logos being watching and looking at the um logo are because remember the logos was the word and you don't want to say was the word he is the word we've got to use it we got to use the word he is as ever present because he's all he's not he he never was or was he is the logos he is these attributes he doesn't lose any of these right and he doesn't gain them because remember when i was a child potentially i was a father right i definitely know i was a son but see us not all knowing god all knowing that's why we must understand this this condescending of god because you and i can't comprehend it as human beings when i was running around playing with the with the neighbors and we were out you know hunting and fishing and doing all these things i had no clue about being a father but yet that potential was in me because what i was a human i was born a male you see what i'm talking about okay because we have a beginning we are finite god does not have a beginning god is infinite okay so but but still we must use man as an example we have to use the daily life of human beings as an example to understand god and then let god raise that level up a little bit higher so in the beginning was the word you say well in we say many times we hold up the bible we say this was before the eternal well this wasn't right this wasn't right because remember when we go back to where we were supposed to be had they not been a fall we're not going to carry bibles around right we are going to be the word all right we are the word made flesh now but potentially we were then but remember god knew he was going to be a father he knew he was going to be a son he knew he was going to be all these attributes because he could see all the way through eternity but you and i can't but the the attribute that he had in him were not being able not able to be displayed until he condescended himself down everybody got that until he until something went forth from god he couldn't be a father a father to be a father you've got to have a child or you've got to have a son you've got to have something to portray that father attribute okay same thing with savior he was a savior when he said let there be he don't you think he knew what was going to happen in the garden of eden soon as he put out of the navy flesh sometimes we lose that thought that that that god's going to make god's got this great eternal vision and everything so perfect and complete it is but don't you think he knew what was going to happen when he put adam in flesh and separated it he knew but remember there's no way he could portray savior to adam and eve before the fall right in eternity before the fall adam and eve did not need a savior at that moment right right the youth was being renewed they were talking to god every day they were everything was just a a garden of eden right but when sent him in the picture the attribute of savior well now look adam and eve didn't need a healer right before the fall right right they didn't have to go look for a um um jehovah gyra right but yet jehovah came and talked to him every day the savior came and talked to adam and eve every day that's what we got to understand about god he always had these attributes he always was a human being he always had the that's what me and brother bob was talking about the other day our brain we only use they say what ten percent some of us less you can move the decimal a couple of places but you know why i'm like louise i gotta i gotta be a loser before i'm being winner i gotta lose this brain that i got but remember everything that you see that happened from the garden of eden to all the way through eternity god had it in his brain you say well god don't have a brain well if god don't have a brain we'll have a brain right right if we were made in his image created in his image his brain knew every person that was going to be on the earth the day they were going to be born the day they were going to die everything they would think in between and there's 7 billion people on the earth now with 12 or 14 000 different languages on the earth and he knew that before before he even started in his brain in his brain see they they they in the world they make god is some got this great big head you know and or he's nothing but just a brain no he's a human he just used all of his capacity he you and i are a cup full of the ocean god is the old ocean so he knew he he threw his brain because you we're going to read in a minute what brother branham was talking about god if he kept it in his mind he could never be any of these attributes if he just kept it up here he had to become something we could understand call the logos or the word when he could step forth and what see remember brother brown said it's always got to be a thought first then it's a word but remember when god thought it it was eternal so it was perfect there's no other way it could be but he had to speak it for us to be able to understand it and for us to be for him to be a savior he had to say genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity see there's the savior coming into being all those attributes listen brother brown said the book of genesis everything begun in genesis so the savior began in genesis hey he was a savior before adam and eve did what they did or god would have killed them both not just one of them both of them all right um i always had a question about before the eternal to something that's eternalism and brother grandpa said that elohim was alone with his boss but let's talk no that's right if he would have ever said a word it would have to start happening but i'm thinking before this before the word yes before the word before there was an actual but now remember here's where you can get real technical with this because remember the thoughts of god are eternal eternal never was or never is are never coming or back it is so that's why you stump people when you say did god think of this and then it happened or is this the thoughts of god happening now because if he thought about it and then there was any gap of time between the part of it taking place that's not eternal said it again that's not eternal if god listen me and you think of something then we filter it through our brain and then we speak it and hey it may not happen even if it does happen there's a gap of time in between right if god's a second older than when he said let there be light he's not eternal one second this is the thoughts of god happening now you've got to see that or you don't or he's not eternal you've got to see that this is not what he thought this is what he's thinking you know if you don't believe in one god completely believe in one god you're gonna put word as god logos is god this is god you don't separate them out you're going to separate them that's what man has done they've separated that it's not separated it's one god sure god dwelt along with his thoughts but how do you dwell in eternity that's only the way we can talk about it is in time but remember if god said let there be and brother brown said it might have been 10 billion years ago if he's one second older than when he said let there be he's not eternal he's not old that's not old to god it's all for us it's all for us it's not for him it's all for us to understand him and to understand what his thoughts are this is the thoughts of god or we're a second person but mom's saying if this is not the very thoughts of god then we have developed something else another person that had to turn around and do the speaking do you understand what i'm saying father i'm a father but for me to be a father josh had to be born there's a gap of time there but god always was the father he always was a son he always but yes there is a time that's why brother roman says back before the eternal but now remember the bible says the beginning of the creation of god wendy what was god's first creation brother brown said god object of worship looks like too not not we're not there the angels were created first remember we are of the very part of god wear the eternal part if you're born again that's that genesis 1 man if you don't understand that genesis 1 26 man you absolutely have two people that's why the people that preach jesus what god and all these other things they are absolutely showing that there's two people but when you understand that genesis one man which we haven't got to yet we gotta get to when we get to that genesis one man that is not a creation as we say creation i've already been through this i've preached it all for 15 years daddy has two the genesis 1 26 man was not nothing and then became something right let's go to genesis 1. and since we have our concordance let's see what that word created me shape or form fashion not create is nothing and then there's something i've explained it a hundred times a car was in the garden of eden that table was in the garden of eden that chair was in the garden of eden this computer was in the garden of eden literally because all the elements that make this up was in the ground in the garden of eden man has created a car man has formed a car the car always was there everybody got that yeah you make it sound like the car was there but the elements that made the car from there the car was there the car was there yeah but when you say literally literally if it's wasn't literally there then where'd it come from there wasn't a chevy sitting in the garden i said car i didn't say shovelling i'm not putting i'm listening i'm not putting a logo on it i said a car what you see the car you see was in the garden of eden the rubber the ore right the alloy the steel the rough plastic everything it was in the garden of eden all the elements that's why there's nothing new under the sun but what did man do man took his finite brain and created a car from those elements but the elements were already there so so now did man create a car no car was always there carl was always in the garden of eden it was laying there brother brown said our bodies was laying in there but something had to shape or form it create henry ford created the car he is the creator of the car he put all these elements together and created a car but he didn't create like we're like nothing and then we got something no everything we see that come up that we're looking at even now come from this earth right everything you your watch your glasses computers does everybody understand that this this come from the earth man has just formed it into a hard substance created sand scenic sand and sea man and lime limestone what man has done is like brother brown said man has took things and created and killed brass was in the garden of eden gunpowder was in the garden of eden man just put it in a bullet and been killing each other with it right but there was always there i've always said that what god created in the original what god created in near reach are brought to view in the original we'll go back to that we won't need cars in the garden we won't need computers in the garden we won't need these tables in the garden cities are going to be gold element trees and everything's going to be just like it was in the garden all right so that word create don't say god created man like there was nothing because remember see this word god that god word god we're getting ahead of ourselves for a reason i guess because we got to go backwards now but this is when that logos began to speak and said let us make man so god which was what elohim brother brown said that's elohim self-existing all right god light one works for special possessions of god if you'll make sure let me give you another thing here if you if you look this gives you all the references in the bible where that's used and it's the same definitions everybody everybody ever seen that before that word elohim is used 2074 times under the word god in the bible so you can find that use it usage by word by that word all right what helped me when i saw it he said you'll eat your weather and your mom eats you here sure absolutely about what we eat it's all about what we eat we can't we can't survive without eating something okay your mama eat you well see you always say well how'd you get here well look your daddy ate potatoes that come out of the 16 elements of the ground he ate that potato that potato became whatever potassium calcium whatever broke down in your body went to blood went to sperm were adults here went to sperm mama ate the same potato but her attribute was to be the mama she didn't have sperm she had egg so that egg developed because of the potato the potassium the calcium and all that formed then the two of you ate and got together one night evening morning it doesn't matter after you ate got strong and here come a baby but what's that baby made out of the same 16 that wants a germain out of them potatoes to give it to that boat yeah well you and potatoes may have something to do with this i don't know potatoes potatoes he eats a lot of potatoes we've learned something now it's going all over the internet okay ryan wake up look so god created man in other words watch what brother brown said god created something off of himself and he continued to be god right now remember in genesis 2 7 when he put that 126 man into a flesh body he became the lord god jehovah with a family right he didn't gain that attribute he just was able to display that attribute when he could look and see adam and eve all right because truly that logos went into adam right that logos went into adam right and then adam could say elephant lion tiger tree go over here wind settled down he was the spokesman or the logo he was the first original son of god what the bible says we'll read it next sunday maybe lord willing because he gives all the lineages and comes right down to adam and he says which adam is the son of god i think it's in luke but god created man in his own image so let's go back now back up so so maybe that'll help you when when somebody says well i created that well don't get real stumped it wasn't that he went no he formed it he shaped it same way with god god shaped man in his own image in other words it was god in another form just like josh's me in another form but we are individual human beings that have different traits and attributes god is not three or four and doesn't have different traits and attributes he's got one he's god he's elohim he's the creator i like what brother dick says because sometimes you can get hung up with the word god did but when you say creator there's only one person that creates one there's only one creator because you can call satan god right all the time they do it people can use jesus christ's name in in a different way than he is and and be saying the name but there's only one creator right and that creator is elohim the logos the savior the healer the theophany the christ all that that's the only way he can create is to be all them if he does not have these already then he's he's not complete you hear that to be the creator everything that comes from him has everything that he creates had to come from him right even satan right but satan had choice just like you and i have a choice all right you and i have a choice satan has a choice because remember god said so here's the speech go back to genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now remember watch this it let there be light and there was light god saw light it was good that has nothing to do with the moon in the sun nothing to do with the moon in the sun the moon in the sun is created on down here further right so this is the light this is the logo that's coming down so that you can see it sure he's the one to create it but god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness satan's children our children god called the light day in the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning with the first day but remember you got to go a little bit further well i'm gonna go here but i guess we will god made verse 16 and god made two great lights well now if he made one without if you create him over there he's creating them again he made two great lights the greater lightning ruled the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also god set them in the firm of the heaven to give light upon the earth well i thought this was what this was over here it's not that light is him that light is him coming to an earth he's created the earth and he's coming down now to divide what the light from the darkness what is darkness darkness is an absence of light the earth was without foreign darkness was upon the face of the deed all right the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and god said let there be light and there was light all right because remember like i said he always was light we're going back to the halo we're going back to the theophany we're going back to the logos he is the light what is he doing he's coming to earth to do the creating brother brown says right here we'll read it maybe next sunday he brutal he he moved over and brooded over the earth that's what he's doing now he's brooding over the earth let there be let there be let there be right because remember i found one right here i want to read and if you don't mind i'm not going to give you the title to the messages i'm going to read you what brother brown said it really doesn't matter what title the message is everybody understand that actually my computer didn't put them on there so listen if you got a revelation of the true word of this message of the hour you don't need 64 65 61 54 47 48 you don't need any of that you don't even need to know where it was preached at what's the matter what does it matter did they did paul tell you everywhere he wrote his sure he said well he said to the galatians well he may have already left the galatians to be sitting in prison in rome writing about the galatians so what does it matter don't make any difference so i'm not going to read these to you because i don't have them but i promise you they were from 47 to 52 because i only got to 1952 with these quotes okay and i didn't put them on here but i'm going to read a couple of them right here like someone was asking the other day god what was he when he was back under millions and millions of years ago when he was not just like this space here and then he gathered up into the logos and then he came from the logos down into christ see it's just god coming down like this to the earth then going right back into god again don't you see what i mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the logos and the logos down into man then returning back right back again for one purpose to redeem that man that has fallen now see we can wrap all this up just by that god condescends to the earth to save man that's the only reason i believe he lived on earth that's just me he said well i know he lived in heaven where we gonna live where's god gonna live when this is over right here right so i believe this was his residence to start with okay brother uh the bible says in psalms that heaven and earth is kissed okay so heaven earth must be pretty close together all right so watch what he says here though he came down here for one purpose to what redeemed man then he's going to carry us back into the eternity right we just dropped down into time and he's going to carry us right back up into eternity and god in the beginning made his first man he made him out of the spirit and spirit is the invisible part of land that you don't see now remember this is his 1947 is where this is coming from because this is the first quote so i know it came from 1947 and he made him out of spirit the spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see now god made man in his own image are you listening to me the congregation said amen all right god made him in his own image and god is the spirit says the bible and the first man that was made had the government over all the creation just like the holy spirit has government over the church today he led the creation so adam was the first poster child of a son of god or the logo he was the one that it's like i said before so you can take this is the way god did it so this is the way i see it like i was saying before i'm gonna say it one more time you take um microsoft now every component that microsoft made let's go back was in the earth right bill gates and a couple other guys sitting in a college dorm in the in the late 70s they're in their human brain they're coming up with these ideas to create a company called microsoft all right but now to take microsoft today and write everything i mean 100 000 people work for microsoft they produce 17 million computers they you see what i'm talking about it would be a book this thick if you wrote a book about microsoft but they have done so well promoting their product with logos and with this and with that and with speech words then i can sit here and i pretty much know what microsoft is without going and reading a book this thick everybody get that some of you don't listen if all that was in god's mind was put in the book you couldn't if we would link the ocean field and where the skies are parchment made and every stall on earth the quill and every man a scribe by trade to write the love of god above see the song the song the song will tell you there's no way you can explain god but he comes down into something that we can see called logos word speech so he can so he can what promote his product and i hope god's not bothered with me saying that because his product is eternal life to me if you take god down to one thing is eternal life he is the eternal so he wants us to understand that because that's what we're going to what we come from is what we're going to jesus said i come from god i go back to god in other words i come from logan i'll go back to the logos all right so you and i have to be now the little poster child because we should act like god but the very first one was god himself and he's saying hey this is what i'm this is what i am without writing a 700 000 page book they won't even get started i've narrowed it all down to 66 books in the bible and that's me now you say well that's pretty narrow-minded well out of those 66 books of the bible even since the book in the 1500s was put together tell me how many millions of sermons has been preached out of that bible since the 1500s to now and continuing on how many millions of sermons has been taken well see if you compile them all in a book you couldn't read it right so you see what god's doing that logos is the holy ghost that's the holy spirit that's leading you today that's the reason let me just say this plain if you don't have the holy ghost you can't understand what he's saying because the holy ghost is the one that said let there be light the holy ghost is the one that's give us the message of the hour the holy ghost is the one that i've always said that if you wrote the if you wrote the book surely you ought to know what what's in it did you hear what i said if you wrote the book i hope you know if you have the holy ghost you wrote the book because there's not two holy ghosts you don't get the holy ghost down here to understand what this hellhole goes saying no same old same holy ghost let me read you this one right here i want you to read this right here now everybody says you know watch brother around the slip of his tongue he put this supernatural being which was called man the third person of the trinity holy spirit into mankind see if you just take that one quote then you got him a trinitarian but it's not you go back a little bit further he's absolutely explaining and this is a long one we gotta go but um remember one thing's for sure we've got to get in our mind we i don't think we truly understand one god and i say we i mean me one god with many attributes that's right that's why the low god if we understand the logos see we understand him better because that's where his speech is coming from it's coming from that low gospel coming from the word of god but as a human being no you're dead that's right back with us yep
