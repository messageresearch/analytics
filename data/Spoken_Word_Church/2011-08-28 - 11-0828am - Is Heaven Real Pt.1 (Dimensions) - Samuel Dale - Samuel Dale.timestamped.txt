[29:54] come on the scene and speak through our
[29:56] hearts and our Liv lives that Lord you
[29:58] would reveal yourself unto us and Lord
[30:01] the main thing that we're trying to do
[30:03] right now is to find out
[30:05] reality of all things that we see that
[30:08] all things are becoming more real unto
[30:11] us and as they become more real unto us
[30:13] it means it's drawing us to a place to
[30:16] where that we can step over into the
[30:19] reality of what we need to have just
[30:23] guide us forgive our sins lead us bless
[30:25] the Hooper family there in the loss of
[30:27] bread and Lord just have your way with
[30:29] each one use us to speak what you'd have
[30:33] to be said in Jesus name amen
[30:38] amen okay
[30:40] first first
[30:43] Peter I could turn and read it off of
[30:46] that but I'd rather use my scriptures
[30:48] amen you 1 Peter 3
[30:52] 18-2 for Christ also who hath once
[30:55] suffered for sins the just for the
[30:57] unjust that he might bring us to God
[31:00] being put to death in the flesh but
[31:02] quickened by the spirit that's right by
[31:05] which also he went and preached unto the
[31:08] spirits in
[31:11] prison number two go over to
[31:14] Revelations
[31:17] 6:9 and when he had opened the fifth
[31:19] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[31:21] them that were slain for the word of God
[31:23] and for the testimony which they held
[31:25] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[31:27] how long how long holy and true does
[31:29] thou not judge and avenge our blood on
[31:32] them that dwell on the earth and white
[31:34] robes were given unto every one of them
[31:36] and it was said unto them that they
[31:38] should rest yet for a little season
[31:40] until their fellow servants also and
[31:43] their Brethren that should be killed as
[31:45] they were should be fulfilled all right
[31:49] now go back to First
[31:52] Timothy
[31:55] 6 talking about the period of the Lord
[31:57] Jesus Christ which in his times he shall
[32:01] show who is the blessed and only
[32:03] potentate the king of kings and Lord of
[32:05] Lord who only hath immortality dwelling
[32:09] in the light which no man can approach
[32:11] unto whom no man has seen nor can see y
[32:16] to whom be honor and power
[32:19] Everlasting amen you may be seated the
[32:22] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[32:24] the word now we've got a lot of
[32:27] lot of the same yeah these two are the
[32:30] same no
[32:32] problem you will see the drawings are
[32:35] different and we will be using them toh
[32:39] go through
[32:41] it but what I want you to see today
[32:46] is we're going to talk about I'm trying
[32:50] my best to get you and me me especially
[32:53] thank you brother to see the real
[32:57] reality of things instead of just you
[33:01] know looking around and seeing what we
[33:04] see here and and all like that and
[33:07] thinking that uh these things are
[33:10] real well they are but just remember
[33:13] like the the earthquake the other day
[33:15] you know that they fell all across the
[33:17] whole uh I guess you call it the Eastern
[33:20] side of the United States right you know
[33:22] you can think well now if you'd have
[33:24] been standing down on Stone Mountain you
[33:26] know you know that rock would have been
[33:29] moving because it's so uh you know so
[33:33] much and they claimed it actually right
[33:35] around the cores and the thought the
[33:37] parts of an earthquake that is just like
[33:39] jelly and you know the the sand that
[33:42] everything just becomes Sandy just this
[33:44] there nothing holding but see we think
[33:46] this is real we think we beat on a a
[33:49] something made from wood and we think
[33:51] it's real and we think that uh the great
[33:53] things that have been made the great
[33:55] skyscrapers and things that have been
[33:57] made out of you know huge metal but we
[34:00] see that two planes fly in and there
[34:03] burns down a building and things cuz
[34:05] there's nothing here that's permanent
[34:09] it's just a temporary
[34:11] thing but yet all of the the Realms of
[34:15] God are more real than the realm that we
[34:18] live in right that's what I'm want you
[34:21] to see I'm wanting you to to try to to
[34:24] understand a little more about uh re ity
[34:28] you know as I've always tried to talk to
[34:30] you about you know saying that uh we say
[34:34] God is Elohim self-existing well I guess
[34:38] one day there was just nothing
[34:39] whatsoever and just a you know there and
[34:42] just and he was just floating around
[34:44] like a glob and and just you know some
[34:47] kind of a something that we can't fathom
[34:49] with our own understanding well I don't
[34:53] see why we can't not you know I don't
[34:56] see why we can't understand now when the
[34:59] prophet of God has brought us the
[35:02] message to show us the scriptures that
[35:05] were already there in the scriptures and
[35:08] and you know the things and just doing
[35:11] that but I'm I'm warning it on your mind
[35:14] about how real everything is and that's
[35:17] what I want you to do today with me
[35:18] stick with me as we try to go up through
[35:20] the dimensions and remember that each
[35:23] Dimension you travel into is greater
[35:26] than the dimension that you're living
[35:29] in right see if if you don't get nothing
[35:32] else out of the message today that's
[35:33] what I want you to see that see as we
[35:36] move in and talk about the fourth
[35:37] dimension well you've heard the prophet
[35:40] say it but see we we just it just blows
[35:42] our mind and we don't even try to think
[35:44] about it we say I don't want to get in
[35:46] them deep things I'll get all messed up
[35:47] don't worry about getting in the Deep
[35:49] things getting messed up you already
[35:50] messed up that's right we born messed up
[35:53] it's just plain language that's you know
[35:55] no need of playing with anything just be
[35:58] straight and
[35:59] honest about it and you know and we we
[36:03] look into things and we talk about uh
[36:07] seeing God and I've asked you many times
[36:10] the question is your God
[36:13] real or is it just some
[36:16] thought is it just some concept or some
[36:19] idea that you have something in your
[36:21] mind that you've you've made up and and
[36:24] and well brother Dale I just can't see
[36:26] he's real I've even been accused of
[36:28] making him too
[36:29] real now if if that's all I got to face
[36:32] god with when this thing is over with
[36:34] then I'll be glad to go to hell for 10
[36:37] billion years on that one thing to try
[36:39] to get people to see that God is real CU
[36:42] what are you going to think about him is
[36:44] he you know you mean he brought you and
[36:46] I into being but he's not greater than
[36:48] we are right see then that way you make
[36:51] the creation which is US greater than
[36:54] the
[36:55] Creator see and and don't do that get it
[36:58] all into to something that you can look
[37:02] at now we're going to talk about the
[37:04] dimensions we've been through this many
[37:06] times in the years past and and the
[37:08] brothers here has covered it real good
[37:10] and but I read you three different three
[37:15] scriptures
[37:17] covering uh three different
[37:20] dimensions all
[37:22] right and the one is Jesus going to hell
[37:26] to to the spirits in prison all right
[37:29] the next is is to going up to see the
[37:32] souls under the altar which is the fifth
[37:34] seal Jew and and all of that and then we
[37:38] went into Timothy to show that there is
[37:41] a position or place that Jesus is in
[37:45] that no man have approached unto that
[37:47] position yet all right and and doing
[37:51] that then that's three different
[37:52] dimensional
[37:54] things okay and and I there's a quote on
[37:57] the back of your your notes on one of
[38:00] them and I don't know where Richard can
[38:02] grab that one I just gave them to them
[38:03] while ago but it's on the back of one of
[38:06] your notes it was an addition so I thank
[38:09] God for brother Joe and brother Richard
[38:11] we we've been working three days on
[38:13] trying to get some things together to be
[38:16] able to do it but there's a message on
[38:18] the the
[38:19] breach which would come on down to the
[38:21] LIC and if he doesn't have to put it on
[38:23] there but if he does yeah all right he
[38:26] talking about see and here is here he is
[38:31] as a mediator on the altar just a little
[38:34] longer until there's more has to suffer
[38:37] like you but now he comes from here at
[38:40] this life seal he's no more mediator
[38:43] he's King now and what does he do and if
[38:45] he's King he has to have subjects and
[38:47] his subjects is them that he has
[38:50] redeemed and they cannot come before him
[38:53] until he takes the rights of Redemption
[38:57] then he walks forth see so then there is
[39:00] a place there that that we've talked
[39:02] about that no man can approach to
[39:04] immortality because immortality is
[39:07] signifying eternal life in a mortal
[39:10] being right it is not talking about just
[39:12] spiritual matters it's not talking about
[39:14] theophanies or or anything it's talking
[39:17] about uh an immortality of a of a doing
[39:21] and and that's where we want to cover it
[39:23] to try to see but the word dimension
[39:28] it says Webster says it's a magnitude
[39:33] measured in a particular direction or
[39:36] along a
[39:38] diameter or principal axis another words
[39:42] it's a measurement of width length
[39:47] height right see it simply means a
[39:51] measuring of a particular thing or the
[39:55] scope of it
[39:57] that's really what a dimension is
[39:59] talking about
[40:00] Cor in other words it's a it's not to
[40:03] say call it a cubicle but that's the
[40:06] best way of thinking because it's length
[40:07] width height breadth Etc you know and
[40:10] and we deal with those things so that is
[40:13] a
[40:14] dimension but what I want you to see is
[40:17] when we get through that these
[40:19] Dimensions so overlay each other until
[40:22] they're right here right because you
[40:25] remember the Lord Jes Jesus standing
[40:27] there one day and he said the son of
[40:30] man which is in heaven right well you
[40:34] know he evidently knew what he was
[40:36] talking about but he had the ability to
[40:39] be able to be in both places
[40:42] right right and understand and and I
[40:45] think that it will help us as we go
[40:48] along because what I'm get it again now
[40:51] as we go up through the mentions
[40:52] remember the next Dimension above what
[40:54] we're talking about is greater than than
[40:56] this Dimension you said no no it's not
[40:59] cuz we're here where we're we we going
[41:01] do no but it's greater because it has
[41:03] the controlling
[41:06] effect upon this
[41:09] Dimension the fourth dimmension is
[41:11] controlling factor of this Dimension
[41:14] right all right and see then you move up
[41:16] to the fith to the center dead we see
[41:18] then that would you know the the the
[41:20] people and then when you would go from
[41:22] dark to the sixth Dimension be the
[41:24] Christian dead well wouldn't you want
[41:26] make sure that they're more greater than
[41:27] we are right I mean what would be the
[41:30] reason why we wouldn't want to to come
[41:32] to a reality cuz remember you can think
[41:35] what you want to I have the drawing
[41:36] already made Joe's worked on it that
[41:39] you're going to see something one of
[41:41] these days that that the Lord willing
[41:43] from just a drawing that you're going to
[41:45] see how everything can come right back
[41:48] down
[41:49] here and and and and all but now I want
[41:53] you to get this point this is the key to
[41:56] to understand what I'm
[42:01] saying a a
[42:03] dimension it is a
[42:07] geographical a place whatever you know
[42:10] that you want to talk about whatever you
[42:11] want to make it you make it what you
[42:13] want to make your your point of seeing
[42:14] what a dimension is but a dimension
[42:20] always will have a
[42:25] limitation
[42:27] it's limited to that Dimension we can't
[42:29] go to the next one
[42:32] right
[42:34] right it's something that we can't do
[42:37] now God could take a profit sure and go
[42:41] through right but Dimensions is the
[42:44] things that you
[42:46] cannot you they can never be done away
[42:51] with no Dimension will ever be done away
[42:53] with now I'm saying this ahead of time
[42:56] so that you'll you'll listen to the
[42:57] message as that go
[43:00] along but see a dimension will always
[43:03] signify a holding area a position a
[43:07] place or a
[43:09] time whatever you want to call
[43:13] it that's why there's only seven
[43:17] dimensions right all right I'm going
[43:19] putting it in here to start with where
[43:20] that anybody hears it then I come back
[43:22] and say things then they can't come
[43:24] along and say well I didn't under now
[43:27] see we'll get to it this evening the
[43:29] Bible speaks of the heavens of the
[43:32] heavens I believe Heaven is more
[43:35] real than we consider it to
[43:38] be and listen
[43:42] Heaven that I'm talking
[43:44] about not the atmospheres cuz they can
[43:47] be called out we will cover these things
[43:50] the you look at your drawing you see on
[43:51] the side that that it says Heaven
[43:53] because heaven can signify atmospheric
[43:56] up from ground up to so far and then you
[43:59] got stratop feres and all kind of
[44:02] spheres that goes out to where that it
[44:04] gets to where you can't breathe and and
[44:06] all kind of things and the layers going
[44:08] up but then you got heaven and Heavenly
[44:11] and then you got the heaven heaven of
[44:13] Heavens all right Heaven that I'm
[44:16] talking about
[44:18] now not to the dimensional situation
[44:20] down here not as we
[44:22] travel Heaven never had a beginning
[44:25] right sure it will never have an ending
[44:28] right Heaven is
[44:31] eternal it is not a
[44:36] dimension right you cannot make Heaven
[44:40] that I'm speaking of a dimension that's
[44:42] right
[44:44] amen because when you try to say it's a
[44:47] dimension you're squaring it off all
[44:50] right everybody understand you might not
[44:52] understand what I'm talking about but do
[44:54] you understand my word
[44:56] yes all right then we will get back to
[44:59] that in maybe 10 messages down the road
[45:01] I'm not worried about it because I want
[45:04] you to see what we're talking about but
[45:06] as I said we read here in the scripture
[45:09] of three different dimensions three
[45:11] different positions right see hell is
[45:15] you know Jesus going sold under the
[45:18] altar under the Sixth Seal and then on
[45:21] up into the seventh Dimension where that
[45:23] Jesus is and uh so watch these as we go
[45:27] along and and then it will help to to
[45:31] understand what I'm trying to say about
[45:32] it being real so remember a
[45:37] dimension is like a thing that can be
[45:41] here and it's around us but we can't see
[45:44] it right something has to happen to our
[45:47] natural eyes to be able to do I I can't
[45:50] stand here and watch people go through
[45:51] this
[45:53] building right right but but if we had a
[45:56] television and set it right there it
[45:59] would show you that that's what's taking
[46:02] place
[46:04] right all right now you remember as a
[46:07] dimension to try to show you to help you
[46:10] you remember that when Lazarus
[46:14] died he went to what would be called the
[46:16] bosom of Abraham which is a place
[46:19] provided by the faith of Abraham not a
[46:20] big old belly that he's
[46:22] got
[46:24] and he wanted somebody to go back and
[46:27] help his
[46:28] brothers right in
[46:31] things but the Bible says there's a
[46:33] great Guth
[46:35] fixed even though that you could stand
[46:39] the one describing could stand and
[46:41] describe what they were seeing they
[46:43] could not cross that
[46:45] Chasm so keep that in mind now we're put
[46:48] scriptures in to where that you don't
[46:50] run off and say well that's just your
[46:53] idea or opinion see it is what the Bible
[46:56] is saying all right so then study that
[46:59] with me now as dimensions and remember
[47:02] in Bible terminologies it means a place
[47:05] or position that is different from the
[47:09] other positions or you would not have
[47:11] seven dimensions all right
[47:16] now see we don't have to take just the
[47:18] words of science but science can prove
[47:22] some of the dimensions I remember
[47:24] reading many many years ago and and I
[47:27] don't understand all of this about the
[47:29] radio waves and the things and all but I
[47:32] remember many many years ago that they
[47:34] said that that they believe they would
[47:36] come a day that they would be able to
[47:38] tap into hell and listen to the
[47:42] people well how close is it getting
[47:46] that's right when that what is her name
[47:48] that got killed over there the lady in
[47:50] the and you know the big princess or
[47:54] something Diana
[47:56] when you know now I know it was on the
[47:58] phone but don't get it don't get it all
[48:00] messed up you know they went back and
[48:02] pulled all of that and they could hear
[48:04] her
[48:10] voice they could still hear her
[48:16] voice see those dimensions are
[48:19] there we just don't know how to tap in
[48:21] and science has been able to tap in to a
[48:23] certain degree and can show these things
[48:26] all right so where do we live
[48:31] at now I'm trying to get a point to
[48:33] watch just some scriptures coming down
[48:35] to where that you'll see the and see
[48:38] it's it's backed up like I said John
[48:40] 3:13 where the son of man which is in
[48:43] heaven nourished it on Earth see it was
[48:46] possible for him being who he was to be
[48:48] in both dimensions at the same time
[48:51] right but now by way of the Prophet
[48:54] messenger and what we can read from
[48:56] science because we believe what they
[48:58] they say we can go through these things
[49:01] to to break down some of the things that
[49:04] we we talk about and and and you know to
[49:08] to be in a understand reality now I gave
[49:14] you a quote from Brother brandom Where
[49:15] that he said
[49:17] on paragraph 110 Souls that are in
[49:21] prison
[49:23] 63 that he believed he had been in both
[49:29] places now here's where we got to cover
[49:31] something because you're going to I
[49:33] don't want to leave leave any
[49:35] loophole see people's computer mind
[49:38] clicks real you mean brother Brown went
[49:39] to hell you say brother Brown he said he
[49:42] did that's up to you right now whether
[49:45] he went there as a person I do not think
[49:47] so that's my personal opinion but he
[49:50] went there as a
[49:51] Visionary you know some way that God
[49:54] could use him because he was a prophet
[49:57] he said I've been in both places right
[50:00] he said I've seen the redeemed the
[50:01] Blessed I've seen the Lost yep in where
[50:05] they were at yep now what about a
[50:08] prophet of God that could travel in
[50:11] those things and be able to see these
[50:15] things and be in totally two different
[50:20] dimensions through the ability of being
[50:22] a prophet of God like I said now I don't
[50:24] believe he went to hell as a thing but
[50:26] he did tell us that it's not
[50:29] burning sir he said that'd be a
[50:32] pleasure so it's not what we think about
[50:35] see we want to put things and just we
[50:37] just lock our mind I don't care what you
[50:39] say cuz you know brother Brown never
[50:40] went to hell but I didn't say he
[50:43] did CU we'll get to it in a little while
[50:45] when he talks about the sixth dimension
[50:47] in heaven and things and he said I
[50:50] didn't say I went
[50:53] right so then that's the way you're
[50:55] going to have to cover it to to do to be
[50:58] able to to handle but now let's just
[51:01] look at these Dimensions brother Joe and
[51:03] them done a wonderful job pulling off
[51:05] let's use the first one on this
[51:07] one and then we'll read it and you keep
[51:11] these now because we're going to be
[51:12] referring back to these all right maybe
[51:15] not necessarily the quotes we have but
[51:17] these that we printed off we're going to
[51:20] be referring back and you'd be surprised
[51:22] how long it took to get that down into
[51:24] to what I wanted because this is the way
[51:28] it was and I I'm not throwing off on
[51:31] nobody it was upside down to compared
[51:33] the way I wanted it because what it done
[51:36] it took one dimension and went down to
[51:38] seven see I told her Jo and them first
[51:40] up front I said I don't want it I said
[51:42] because there is no such thing other
[51:45] only thing you could go is down and I
[51:47] know you're going down if you're not
[51:49] saved I know that I know the quotes in
[51:51] the Bible but yet we've got to talk
[51:54] about a Christian so we don't want one
[51:56] going down I don't think the seven
[51:58] dimensions going down but we turned it
[52:01] over to be able to bring it to place
[52:03] that we could see that you know right
[52:06] here we can understand and let your
[52:09] Prophet answer these things now watch
[52:11] him it's off of the message
[52:14] uh present stage of my Ministry 1962 uh
[52:18] 9008 that's number uh would be number
[52:21] two on your
[52:24] notes
[52:26] now when we come along we remember that
[52:28] we live here in three dimensions I don't
[52:31] know whether I can name them or not one
[52:33] of them is light the other is matter
[52:35] Tommy you remember what the third is
[52:37] someone says something the editor huh
[52:40] Adam somebody must have said Adam Adam
[52:42] someone else says time time right now
[52:47] light matter and time we use I like Life
[52:50] Light matter because that's just held
[52:52] over from the old school days and and
[52:54] the things it's the same thing all right
[52:58] and our five senses contact them
[53:01] Dimensions because that's actually we
[53:03] live in the third dimension which would
[53:05] mean that you could break it down to a
[53:07] one dimension is life one dimension is
[53:10] time and one dimension is matter you can
[53:13] break it on down we don't care to do
[53:15] that we're care to just go along to show
[53:17] you where we're living all right if you
[53:20] see the drawing it's got the caste feel
[53:22] smelling here on it that I like that
[53:25] and because that's where you know that's
[53:28] where we're dwelling at is where we're
[53:30] at here we're controlled by those things
[53:33] but now I going keep saying this see we
[53:35] think those things are more
[53:37] real well then what keeps you alive when
[53:40] you go to sleep right amen what what
[53:42] happens in a dream right what happens in
[53:45] a vision uh you know what happens in
[53:48] those things the Y and and I tried to
[53:51] cover there the other day where the
[53:53] Prophet was talking about how that that
[53:55] our and we'll get back to it a little
[53:56] bit in the fourth dimension that our
[53:58] dreams a lot of times being nightmares
[54:01] because that we're we're Hy we're
[54:03] between the conscious and the
[54:05] subconscious and see we can't connect
[54:07] with brother brandom see his conscious
[54:09] and subconscious the doctors even said
[54:11] said we don't understand said you could
[54:13] dream a dream while you're standing Wide
[54:15] Awake said because your subconscious
[54:18] your conscience is together well see us
[54:21] human Mortals are not made that way that
[54:23] God made that as a gift you know and and
[54:26] and I like that but all right do you
[54:28] understand what I'm talking about we
[54:31] live in what is called the third
[54:32] dimension which is
[54:35] light light time you know matter uh
[54:40] we'll give you a quot to brother ROM in
[54:41] a minute where he even covers thoughts
[54:43] and and different things but here we're
[54:47] living in
[54:48] this we think this is so
[54:51] real and thank God for it cuz this is
[54:54] where we began our Earthly journey and
[54:57] that's why it'll never be annihilated I
[54:59] told you when when I'm finished with
[55:01] this if I do it you tell me I did
[55:04] there'll be none of these Dimensions
[55:06] will be
[55:10] annihilated none of these Dimensions
[55:12] will be
[55:13] annihilated but they will be
[55:15] incorporated into eternal life that's
[55:18] right you know all right see because
[55:21] that's what I think about eternal life
[55:23] that's what I think about God
[55:25] and how real he is he's just not some
[55:29] thought I mean to me he's a person amen
[55:33] he's not just well Jesus is one person
[55:37] God's no we can't go that way we
[55:41] supposed to be away from that
[55:42] trinitarian concept that's right and
[55:45] surely we can understand but all right
[55:46] let's go with that now and get these out
[55:48] of the way then we'll get back and read
[55:49] a little bit so then we go up from the
[55:52] third dimension we know that we go to
[55:54] the fourth dimension
[55:55] which you can see on the the drawing the
[55:58] fourth dimension is covered like the and
[56:00] it's perfectly put in there I really
[56:02] enjoyed the every who put these together
[56:04] and Aller what they done I just needed
[56:06] to rearrange it for my thoughts but see
[56:09] it's a good point put the tree of
[56:12] knowledge see the tree of knowledge of
[56:15] Good and Evil was a good point because
[56:17] that will cover the fourth dimension yep
[56:21] right because it is knowledge it is that
[56:24] and science has been able to break into
[56:26] those things that's right brother R said
[56:29] they broke into God's
[56:30] laboratory that's why they can do the
[56:32] things that that they're doing I never
[56:34] could understand how that brother Mo
[56:36] used to try to explain how that that
[56:38] they had a that you could take a it was
[56:41] cat was called now it went on into
[56:43] something else in the radio but you
[56:44] didn't even need a battery you didn't
[56:47] need
[56:48] anything it was a crystal and it was
[56:50] brought together and you had to line
[56:53] everything just perfectly up but you you
[56:55] didn't need a
[56:56] speaker you had a
[56:59] radio he said I don't believe that well
[57:03] see that's what the man told Brother mo
[57:06] one time he talking about them going in
[57:07] the outer space he he dips enough he
[57:10] don't believe that they a go out of
[57:13] space they just went out there in the
[57:15] desert somewhere well they did fly out
[57:18] in the Des but you know he just didn't
[57:21] believe it people ain't going to believe
[57:22] it and I'm not concerned about trying to
[57:24] get you to believe something my point is
[57:26] not to get you to believe how
[57:27] mechanically minded I am to be able to
[57:29] put all of this together because I told
[57:31] you if the devil hadn't made me sick I
[57:32] wouldn't have all the thoughts so you
[57:34] can blame the headaches and the and the
[57:36] temperatures for if you want to and say
[57:38] well that was his imagination well
[57:40] that's all right let's see if it fits
[57:41] the Bible if it don't then it's my
[57:44] imagination but we've got the fourth
[57:46] dimension which will be covering in the
[57:48] trip of knowledge The Fifth Dimension is
[57:51] a place for
[57:52] the unbelievers
[57:56] The Sinner dead y who died without
[57:59] Christ then you got under the
[58:01] altar which is the souls under the altar
[58:04] covering it with brother brandham you
[58:05] know and where he went to and that's the
[58:09] Christians who have passed
[58:10] on and then we have the place of called
[58:13] God alone all right and see we'll get
[58:17] back into it that there's an
[58:20] altar because that's where we are we're
[58:22] if you pass on you're under the altar
[58:24] right you know the different things were
[58:27] there but you can't go up into that
[58:29] seventh Dimension at this period of time
[58:32] that's right because it's still limited
[58:34] because we haven't reached
[58:36] immortality all right he can condescend
[58:39] to where we are and everything but we
[58:42] can't go into immortality because that's
[58:45] what he went into right amen all right
[58:47] we we've got the scriptures we're going
[58:49] through it now let's read what your
[58:50] Prophet had to say CU we were reading
[58:53] paragraph 21 a present stage of my
[58:54] Ministry now let's start with paragraph
[58:56] 22 23
[58:59] 24 now but we have contact through
[59:03] science the fourth dimension as it was
[59:06] because coming through this building now
[59:09] comes pictures voices of radio pictures
[59:13] on
[59:14] television that our senses does not
[59:16] contact that but yet they have a a tube
[59:20] or a crystal that picks up these ether
[59:23] ws and manif them so you see right in
[59:27] this building now is live actions of
[59:30] people in the a live voices they're here
[59:34] we know it they're absolutely the truth
[59:37] and the only thing you do they they
[59:41] catch it on I don't understand the
[59:43] mechanics of of those things that
[59:46] science has invented but we know that it
[59:49] proves to us there is a fourth
[59:52] dimension all right now we will get to
[59:55] it as we go along into the message
[59:56] brother brandham says cancer is a
[59:59] fourth-dimensional disease right
[1:00:02] amen all right and see then you will
[1:00:06] understand the things that has happened
[1:00:09] in life and we'll get down to it
[1:00:11] eventually to where that brother BR said
[1:00:13] like demons
[1:00:15] travel demons travel in that fourth
[1:00:19] dimension and in in backwards and forth
[1:00:22] all right now go on paragraph 23 Now The
[1:00:25] Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the
[1:00:27] unbeliever dies and goes
[1:00:29] to The Fifth Dimension is kind of well
[1:00:33] the horrible Dimension what do we get
[1:00:35] down to reading what those things are
[1:00:36] like a
[1:00:37] nightmare now this man and when a
[1:00:40] Christian dies he goes into the sixth
[1:00:42] Dimension and God is in the seventh
[1:00:46] Dimension now then you see the Christian
[1:00:48] when he dies he goes under the altar of
[1:00:51] God watch it right into the presence of
[1:00:54] God Under The Altar and he's at rest
[1:00:57] well brother daily we go right into the
[1:00:59] presence of
[1:01:01] God
[1:01:05] Amen but yet there's a dimension where
[1:01:07] God is at right that is not reached by
[1:01:10] mortality right all right now we made
[1:01:13] the other one to give you more of an
[1:01:16] idea
[1:01:17] okay this is the same thing but it's
[1:01:20] more of an
[1:01:22] idea now when you look at it you're
[1:01:24] going to think that brother Dale is
[1:01:26] goofed up what he's drawing and all cuz
[1:01:29] remember Joe and them done this and
[1:01:30] don't blame them they draw what I told
[1:01:33] them I wanted but see you got written on
[1:01:37] it this all of your things over here
[1:01:39] then you have heaven heaven is an
[1:01:43] atmosphere that's why it speaks of
[1:01:45] heavens of
[1:01:46] Heavens that's why it speaks that heaven
[1:01:48] and earth can pass away
[1:01:52] right right
[1:01:55] I mean the Bible's right because there
[1:01:58] are Heavens right there Heavenly
[1:02:01] atmospheres there spars that you grow up
[1:02:03] into right see and each one of them now
[1:02:06] you look how this dra out see first is
[1:02:09] life you know T like time light and
[1:02:11] matter next is the tree of knowledge
[1:02:14] which is the fourth dimension and then
[1:02:15] you put in there and you see all of
[1:02:17] these horrible
[1:02:19] things Fifth Dimension is the siner
[1:02:23] dead h look it's just in a space right
[1:02:27] okay these were brought in w war it's
[1:02:28] just in a space it's not a you
[1:02:32] know you don't hear Brother random
[1:02:34] talking about when he went down to Hell
[1:02:38] and did he seen green grce and times no
[1:02:42] that's right but when he went to the
[1:02:44] sixth Dimension if you look up in the
[1:02:45] sixth Dimension you'll see it begins to
[1:02:48] be
[1:02:49] green look at your drawing it begins to
[1:02:52] be green you can see it probably here
[1:02:54] here and look at the trees and the
[1:02:56] things cuz in the sixth Dimension when
[1:02:58] brother R went there he said people come
[1:03:00] running over the hills
[1:03:03] and right people were running he said
[1:03:06] over the heels and over the thing
[1:03:08] comeing right man they real amen that's
[1:03:13] right so that's what I'm trying to get
[1:03:14] you to
[1:03:16] see who wouldn't brother R didn't want
[1:03:19] to come
[1:03:20] back right that's right right amen he
[1:03:23] wanted to stay where he's at
[1:03:24] wow it was a whole lot more real and
[1:03:26] better yeah then look up to the seventh
[1:03:29] see and you'll see that it still covers
[1:03:33] trees and things and all up into where
[1:03:36] God would be in the seventh Dimension we
[1:03:38] have an altar
[1:03:40] there because we are under the the sixth
[1:03:43] Dimension you're under the altar of God
[1:03:47] all right and Jesus is laying on that
[1:03:50] altar right okay now we have some more
[1:03:54] draw drawings to bring later to pick up
[1:03:56] what we're talking about but see then
[1:03:57] everything just ties into that green and
[1:04:00] just greater and greater and greater
[1:04:02] until you get into what we'll get this
[1:04:04] afternoon the
[1:04:06] heaven of
[1:04:09] Heavens there's about six or eight
[1:04:12] scriptures that will cover the heavens
[1:04:14] of Heavens all right now so let's get on
[1:04:19] with
[1:04:22] something we went through the dimension
[1:04:25] he called them light life and matter all
[1:04:28] right let's go down to number four I
[1:04:31] think is where we'll pick up to right
[1:04:34] right let's study a little bit about
[1:04:36] these and I'm not going to spend much
[1:04:38] time in it I'm just going to cover a few
[1:04:40] things to make sure you understand the
[1:04:42] reality of what I'm trying to
[1:04:45] bring and then connect to it in a way to
[1:04:50] where you can see that these things are
[1:04:51] real CU in no way did I bring if if
[1:04:54] you've seen what's lay in my office you
[1:04:56] know the uh Paper Company loved me and
[1:05:00] the computers you know the ink and thing
[1:05:02] but uh you know I'm just handpicking
[1:05:06] certain things now one in he a minute
[1:05:07] I'll show you that I had to handpick for
[1:05:09] a long time because I didn't want to
[1:05:11] bring out what brother around
[1:05:14] said I'll cover it just a
[1:05:19] minute look what he says enticing
[1:05:22] Spirits paragraph 38
[1:05:25] 19 and
[1:05:28] 55724 he's talking about healings and
[1:05:31] applying the things and coming down and
[1:05:33] the gross and the cataracts and the
[1:05:35] spread of diseases and tubercular and
[1:05:37] things you know and demons that's in a
[1:05:39] physical form now this morning we're
[1:05:42] going to talk about talk about demons in
[1:05:45] spiritual form in the soul they're in
[1:05:48] the soul the same as they are in the
[1:05:50] body and we're bound to admit that we
[1:05:53] see them in PE people's body such as
[1:05:56] Cancers and and different diseases
[1:05:58] that's in the human body just recently
[1:06:01] even cancer has been declared to be a
[1:06:04] fourth-dimensional disease now watch
[1:06:07] it that it's in another dimension
[1:06:14] y sure it's
[1:06:18] demonology every disease is a
[1:06:20] fourth-dimension disease the beginning
[1:06:23] of it
[1:06:24] yet
[1:06:26] yep see because see your minds collect
[1:06:30] on cancer as a
[1:06:33] growth right unlock it cancer doesn't
[1:06:37] start as a growth
[1:06:39] right we know the prophet's message
[1:06:41] right even cancer is a backsliding
[1:06:44] cell right right it is not a growth it
[1:06:49] doesn't appear as a growth if it does if
[1:06:50] something was wrong you might have been
[1:06:52] born with it that way but it still still
[1:06:54] in its natural beginning it was not that
[1:06:57] right the and there's a lot of growth in
[1:07:01] the human body a lot of things they can
[1:07:03] take out and they they're wrong growth
[1:07:07] and and would be things that would be
[1:07:08] horrible and can kill us but they're not
[1:07:11] like
[1:07:12] cancer cancer is that cell that has
[1:07:15] backsliding in itself and the bases that
[1:07:18] it can can come forth and and uh you
[1:07:22] know and be a thing and it it's a life
[1:07:26] now how much do I need to cover that you
[1:07:29] should know that anybody internet
[1:07:31] listening to listen to brother R anytime
[1:07:33] at all you'll hear him talk about the
[1:07:34] life of the cancer he said now the life
[1:07:37] of the cancer is gone out he said but
[1:07:39] the growth is still there he said your
[1:07:41] body has to counteract that growth or
[1:07:45] either you have to go have it cut out
[1:07:47] see and and doing and and you know and
[1:07:50] that's why that he says you can do those
[1:07:53] things and be away and but if you let
[1:07:55] that come back
[1:07:57] yeah right he said you can be healed of
[1:08:00] a thing today and and die tomorrow of it
[1:08:03] why because you let the life come
[1:08:06] back see you you let it come back into
[1:08:10] taking its place the unclean Spirit
[1:08:13] goeth out a man walketh in dry places
[1:08:14] find his rest you know and don't find a
[1:08:16] rest sick of n he comes back and finds a
[1:08:18] house SW and garnish you know the
[1:08:20] scripture right all right so it's a a
[1:08:23] Domin
[1:08:24] disease he said all diseases every
[1:08:27] disease is a fourth dimensional disease
[1:08:31] y all right that's why that there's no
[1:08:33] way to do nothing other than treat your
[1:08:36] symptoms in your body right actually all
[1:08:39] mankind can do is try to Aid your immune
[1:08:42] system right and that's what AIDS is
[1:08:45] AIDS is not a growth development that
[1:08:47] does something to do that it simply
[1:08:50] attacks your immune system and you die
[1:08:53] from other things you don't die of AIDS
[1:08:56] you die from the effects of what it's
[1:08:58] drained the body of the immune system
[1:09:01] and brother R said God put it into us in
[1:09:03] the garden the an immune system into the
[1:09:07] human body and that Satan is attacking
[1:09:10] that cuz he knows if he can attack these
[1:09:13] bodies see that's why it's just good to
[1:09:15] be strong and and and do the best you
[1:09:17] can you know and exercise and and and
[1:09:20] and and everything you know eat right
[1:09:23] and do right
[1:09:24] I mean you got high blood pressure go
[1:09:26] eat you all the pork you don't to well
[1:09:27] you're just you're bringing it on
[1:09:29] yourself then you doctor no it ain't
[1:09:32] doctor it's
[1:09:34] you see I know better than E I got high
[1:09:37] blood pressure I know better better than
[1:09:39] the the eat a garbage can full of pork
[1:09:41] but I love
[1:09:43] it it's one of my most favorite Meats I
[1:09:45] guess is is pork but I don't eat a lot
[1:09:49] of it why because I know see we're not
[1:09:54] like we used to be in the old days when
[1:09:55] you when you had the large bucket full
[1:09:57] of grease and it was going out in the
[1:09:59] field and and you go out there and burn
[1:10:01] it out you know worked it off and swe
[1:10:03] it's not done it's just building it's
[1:10:05] just building up into it it's killing us
[1:10:08] but you understand what the prophet is
[1:10:09] talking about
[1:10:10] Dimensions see in that fourth
[1:10:13] dimension those diseases are there now I
[1:10:16] hunted until I found this quote before I
[1:10:18] would would bring it out because I know
[1:10:20] that it can hinder people's
[1:10:22] Faith now
[1:10:24] there has never been an operation that
[1:10:27] could take away
[1:10:33] cancer
[1:10:34] amen when you go down and they tell you
[1:10:37] you're cancer free that means it's
[1:10:39] you're down to the basis this is 80
[1:10:41] something th000 count right I believe
[1:10:44] it's the right number now if I miss that
[1:10:45] just you put a number there whatever if
[1:10:47] it's two or four I believe it's 80,000
[1:10:51] count and the machine will not record
[1:10:54] below that so when they tell you you're
[1:10:56] cancer free cuz nobody in the world is
[1:10:59] cancer free everybody has
[1:11:04] cancer now you want the Bible though my
[1:11:07] skin worms de destroy my body and in my
[1:11:10] flesh shall I see God all right it's
[1:11:13] because of the immune system that can
[1:11:15] fight off those things and keep it under
[1:11:18] control but it means that there's if
[1:11:21] they say you're cancer free that means
[1:11:22] you're 80
[1:11:24] ,000 every what is the thing that
[1:11:26] they're using there to count that that's
[1:11:28] in your body up to that point but they
[1:11:30] can't record any lower so they count you
[1:11:32] cancer
[1:11:33] free and I didn't want to read the
[1:11:35] things brother rman said cuz it was a
[1:11:37] good meing but I found this one so let's
[1:11:39] look at it number
[1:11:41] five which is God provided a lamb 1956
[1:11:46] 614 he's talking about Abraham the
[1:11:49] coming down said oh my young brother
[1:11:51] sitting there in the wheelchair if you
[1:11:53] could only see that promise tonight
[1:11:55] sunny boy calvar is before you if you
[1:11:58] can just move the Shadows from your mind
[1:12:00] look there are something would anchor
[1:12:03] down in here there would be nothing in
[1:12:05] the world ever moving you'd be pushing
[1:12:08] that wheelchair out of the building and
[1:12:10] around the cable Tabernacle and the
[1:12:13] place where you come from and you that's
[1:12:16] dying with heart trouble worst killer
[1:12:19] there is cancer doctors can hardly do a
[1:12:22] thing about it I heard on the radio the
[1:12:25] other day that it couldn't be proved
[1:12:28] that one time an operation for cancer
[1:12:31] was ever
[1:12:32] successful they called it a fourth
[1:12:34] dimensional Dimension disease but God's
[1:12:37] got to cure now that's what I want you
[1:12:39] to read so I didn't want to read all
[1:12:41] them other see God's Got The
[1:12:43] Cure medicine is remedies God is
[1:12:47] cure I am the Lord that Health all of
[1:12:49] thy
[1:12:50] diseases all right see because
[1:12:55] how can you take out a
[1:12:57] demon a knife won't take a demon out of
[1:12:59] the
[1:13:00] body right it will take the growth
[1:13:04] that's right he said well if it's
[1:13:07] contained they say that your eyes the
[1:13:09] best place to have cancer because in the
[1:13:11] eyeball that they can literally take it
[1:13:13] out and it's contained within that and
[1:13:15] it you know it does but see you know
[1:13:18] what I'm talking about you got your limp
[1:13:19] nodes you got all these things that's
[1:13:20] why that they run all of their test and
[1:13:22] they do everything to try to check and
[1:13:24] see if it's anywhere else in the
[1:13:28] body but see I I thought I said I don't
[1:13:31] want people to think that I'm in
[1:13:35] unbelief I wanted your Prophet to say it
[1:13:37] but I didn't want to bring all of the
[1:13:38] quotes where he was saying that it's
[1:13:40] been proven that you cannot operate take
[1:13:42] out cancer
[1:13:44] right you can't take a disease out of
[1:13:46] the human body if it is a
[1:13:49] fourth-dimensional product
[1:13:52] disease God God has to drive it out
[1:13:56] right he's the only
[1:13:58] healer amen I don't care what you say
[1:14:01] that I went through this I went through
[1:14:02] that and it took care of that remember
[1:14:04] you're down to the 80,000
[1:14:08] count you're down to the basis to where
[1:14:11] that all must happen is something to
[1:14:13] your immune system click and when it
[1:14:16] does it would start right
[1:14:18] back thank God for what we call immune
[1:14:21] system right amen I me thank God for
[1:14:25] healing he can take it away and totally
[1:14:28] cure the
[1:14:29] body but he's still going to there's
[1:14:31] still going to be those cells in there
[1:14:33] that's going to kill us there's still
[1:14:35] going to be those worms that's going to
[1:14:37] eat us up that's what you tell people
[1:14:39] you know and they just just cringe at
[1:14:41] you you know you say you ain't nothing
[1:14:42] but a bunch of
[1:14:44] worms that's right I saw a video one
[1:14:48] time of where they proven
[1:14:49] it you look under the layer of your skin
[1:14:55] with a high powered microscope and you
[1:14:57] look down and it ain't nothing but
[1:14:58] simply hollered out little things this
[1:15:00] G's already scratch and go it's just
[1:15:03] simple hollered out little holes under
[1:15:05] there microscopic small and there's a
[1:15:08] little worms just crawling all
[1:15:12] around sister gwy she wakes up in the
[1:15:14] night and go in worms
[1:15:19] again
[1:15:21] but they got to take care of
[1:15:23] right that's right that's why we got to
[1:15:25] depend on him all right I'm trying to
[1:15:27] put in a little bit with each one to
[1:15:29] where that'll be more interesting to
[1:15:31] just talk about a dimension that we can
[1:15:34] can
[1:15:35] cover all
[1:15:37] right now a fourth dimension is like the
[1:15:40] prophet was covering on number six of
[1:15:44] your
[1:15:45] notes where it's uh show us the father
[1:15:49] 1963
[1:15:52] 606 and he's telling you about the River
[1:15:56] of No Return where he said he caught a
[1:15:58] world record trout you know a lot of
[1:15:59] people didn't know that he caught a
[1:16:00] world record trout on that River and he
[1:16:02] was telling people to you know that
[1:16:05] where he's at and and everything the
[1:16:07] guide and the thing but he saw was it
[1:16:09] Merlin Monroe that was in a
[1:16:11] movie I believe it was Merlin Monroe in
[1:16:13] a movie and he saw her in the movie
[1:16:17] because he he wanted to see it because
[1:16:18] of the river he had been up and down
[1:16:20] that River and he saw her he said she
[1:16:23] was it never
[1:16:24] move see a
[1:16:27] fourth-dimensional thing a picture that
[1:16:30] was made and brought into a fourth
[1:16:32] dimensional scene right and he said in
[1:16:35] that
[1:16:37] Dimension he said we'll have to answer
[1:16:40] at the day of judgment are you
[1:16:43] reading I have to answer at the day of
[1:16:46] judgment do you say but I got by with
[1:16:49] it nobody didn't see me undress and
[1:16:57] nobody didn't see me make lud things
[1:17:00] yeah just
[1:17:03] remember in another dimension pictures
[1:17:07] are
[1:17:08] captured but nobody didn't take a
[1:17:10] picture of me it didn't it don't have to
[1:17:13] be because that's a
[1:17:15] fourth-dimensional
[1:17:16] place
[1:17:20] amen and brother Bram even said the
[1:17:23] color of your hire
[1:17:25] yep the color of your
[1:17:28] clothes and the things would be
[1:17:31] captured I've watched Joe with this
[1:17:33] thing my brother-in-law told me years
[1:17:35] ago because he was a photographer and
[1:17:37] this is talking about 40 years
[1:17:40] ago he said I said something about
[1:17:43] something had happened he said Sam I can
[1:17:45] take you put you in a motel with a woman
[1:17:48] and he said there ain't no way you can
[1:17:49] prove you wouldn't
[1:17:52] there
[1:17:53] he said I can overlay the camera and do
[1:17:56] things with it he said and put you in
[1:17:58] that
[1:18:01] room because it can be done you already
[1:18:03] to see Joe and I told him I said boy
[1:18:05] that'd be something if I had that
[1:18:06] computer I could do it he just take
[1:18:08] reach a corner like this and just peel
[1:18:09] off and just peel off you see like at
[1:18:12] you peel off
[1:18:15] overlays it was it Bruce Lee that they
[1:18:17] finished the
[1:18:19] movie with a stand in and then they made
[1:18:22] it
[1:18:23] uh animated form of it and tied it all
[1:18:26] together and they say you can't tell
[1:18:27] where that the original movie stopped
[1:18:29] and the guy got killed here in the movie
[1:18:30] being
[1:18:31] made and see the because they can do it
[1:18:35] you just think what science how advanced
[1:18:36] it can be and it's a fourth dimension
[1:18:40] right that's what I'm getting us at it's
[1:18:42] a fourth dimension that's right amen
[1:18:44] that they can do all of these things
[1:18:46] with trick photographies through
[1:18:49] everything and show you all of that
[1:18:52] doing
[1:18:53] overlays this trick
[1:18:55] photography and see every move we
[1:19:01] make go down to the next one go that's
[1:19:04] what he's
[1:19:08] covering so Paradox 1965 117 number
[1:19:12] seven on you not as I said in my last
[1:19:15] message you standing over there against
[1:19:17] that wall when I was here a few weeks
[1:19:19] ago every time you move your finger that
[1:19:22] goes around and around the world never
[1:19:25] will stop every move you make you'll see
[1:19:28] it at judgment television proves that
[1:19:31] it's here the fourth dimension cuz
[1:19:34] television doesn't manufacture that
[1:19:36] picture it only channels that wave into
[1:19:39] a tube and you see a picture color
[1:19:41] everything every moving object that's
[1:19:44] happening in the world is going right
[1:19:46] around through here now making a record
[1:19:50] someday your record is going to be
[1:19:52] closed
[1:19:53] and you're going to answer to that
[1:19:55] record that's right that's
[1:19:58] right so you kids think you're getting
[1:20:00] by with things right you think you
[1:20:03] sniffing a little dope you think you do
[1:20:04] a little drinking you think you do a
[1:20:06] little U maybe um unclosed a little bit
[1:20:09] in the wrong place or do this that just
[1:20:14] remember those are being
[1:20:16] seen sisters too you sneak around put a
[1:20:19] little bit of makeup on do a little bit
[1:20:21] of paint in your face up you know do a
[1:20:23] little thing just remember I brother
[1:20:27] They Don't Preach a lot about this
[1:20:30] right but every once in a while I lay
[1:20:32] down some things and when I do you
[1:20:34] better
[1:20:36] think that's right you said but nobody
[1:20:39] didn't see
[1:20:41] me right right you mean God can't see
[1:20:46] you that he knows before we ever even
[1:20:48] think about doing it amen that's right
[1:20:52] but see it's on record that's what I'm
[1:20:54] getting at Fourth
[1:20:56] Dimension is a whole lot more real than
[1:20:59] the Life
[1:21:02] Light and time or matter and time or
[1:21:06] whatever the fourth dimension is real
[1:21:08] why because there's pictures being taken
[1:21:11] of everything
[1:21:13] right you see or would there be any
[1:21:17] problems then to if you could some way
[1:21:19] tie those Dimensions together why
[1:21:21] couldn't you hear somebody in another
[1:21:23] dimension crying
[1:21:28] out
[1:21:29] dreams go into a fourth
[1:21:32] dimension nightmares and things fourth
[1:21:37] dimension and that's why they're so
[1:21:40] horrible cuz that's the way brother R
[1:21:42] described hell right he said hell was
[1:21:45] not a burning place he said it's a
[1:21:48] constant
[1:21:49] falling why because there's no bottom to
[1:21:51] it there's there's no scripture for an
[1:21:53] eternal hell see there's no bottom
[1:21:55] that's right no scripture for it so then
[1:21:58] it's just a constant falling that's
[1:22:00] going on down right
[1:22:02] see I gave you the next one on number
[1:22:04] eight of your notes I hope I can get
[1:22:06] through because I got a little bit I
[1:22:08] want to cover if I
[1:22:10] can but he calls them there the three
[1:22:12] dimensions and he calls it light air and
[1:22:17] thought now this is really after the
[1:22:19] other one where he was doing the time on
[1:22:21] but he called him you know light I'm
[1:22:23] giving that to just show you the case
[1:22:24] somebody comes along and said well I
[1:22:25] found this and works this way but see
[1:22:28] it's still what's the difference it's
[1:22:31] all the three
[1:22:34] dimensions whether you want to call it
[1:22:36] thought whether you want to call it that
[1:22:38] he covers it the same as being the radio
[1:22:40] W right right and he tells you where
[1:22:43] this the center goes to yep in that
[1:22:47] quote down there on the next about three
[1:22:49] three lines from the bottom then I think
[1:22:51] the Fifth Dimension is where the sinner
[1:22:53] dies where he goes now I think that when
[1:22:55] The Sinner dies he goes to this fourth
[1:22:57] dimension now
[1:23:01] listen I wonder if he made a mistake the
[1:23:05] first thing he cannot go into the
[1:23:07] presence of God because he is a sinner
[1:23:09] and his time is up on Earth I wonder did
[1:23:11] he make a mistake on that
[1:23:14] one
[1:23:17] because if you look in the way I draw it
[1:23:20] on this one or had Jo them to
[1:23:23] draw can you click this one back up
[1:23:28] rich it takes a second I know to do it
[1:23:31] but you notice I have archways I don't
[1:23:34] have straight lines cuz I didn't want
[1:23:36] straight
[1:23:37] lines you see the ARs ways right see
[1:23:41] that fourth dimension goes right up into
[1:23:42] the
[1:23:46] fifth it's only God can cut those things
[1:23:49] off right sure so you can go from one
[1:23:51] then a a
[1:23:53] maybe brother Brandon wasn't wrong when
[1:23:54] he was talking about The Fifth Dimension
[1:23:55] there and then he called it the fourth
[1:23:57] dimension
[1:23:58] right CU remember what we do in the
[1:24:02] fourth dimension is going into the fifth
[1:24:03] that we don't get it
[1:24:05] clear right right cuz that'd be where we
[1:24:08] go to maybe he doesn't make as many
[1:24:11] mistakes as we think he makes maybe he's
[1:24:14] more than what we think about it all
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:23] let's see getting off on my
[1:24:25] notes all
[1:24:27] right but you go right on down that's
[1:24:30] the countdown you just keep right on
[1:24:32] down if I were you I would there's two
[1:24:33] messages I would listen to one of them
[1:24:35] is called the countdown and the other
[1:24:37] one is present stage of my
[1:24:39] Ministry if I was wanting two tapes to
[1:24:41] read the books to to read or two tapes
[1:24:43] to listen to is to get the countdown and
[1:24:45] president stage of my Ministry and and
[1:24:48] watch him in what he's
[1:24:50] describing but he says if I would type
[1:24:53] it for
[1:24:54] you now remember he's still talking
[1:24:56] about this fourth dimensional things
[1:24:58] now it's like trying to go to
[1:25:01] sleep he talking about a fourth
[1:25:04] dimension you can't be
[1:25:07] asleep and you're in a
[1:25:09] nightmare you hideous things you're
[1:25:12] screaming you you're just all that's the
[1:25:17] state of the wicked dead and he cannot
[1:25:19] go into the presence of God because he
[1:25:21] is a sinner that's right he cannot
[1:25:23] return back to the Earth because his
[1:25:25] times up and he and he's caught between
[1:25:29] the two things in The Fifth
[1:25:31] Dimension he's got a soul he he cannot
[1:25:35] go into the presence of God because it's
[1:25:37] not covered by the blood he's a sinner
[1:25:40] and he cannot wake himself up because
[1:25:42] his times up on Earth so there he is in
[1:25:46] a tormented nightmare y think of that
[1:25:49] now because before you enter in a
[1:25:52] nightmare
[1:25:53] screen many of us have had nightmares
[1:25:57] it's just because we're told because the
[1:25:59] two consciences are passing sub and
[1:26:02] first conscience and it catches between
[1:26:05] and that's the Nightmare and when you a
[1:26:08] sinner dies he's caught between caught
[1:26:10] with his soul between Earth and Hell in
[1:26:13] a
[1:26:14] nightmare there he
[1:26:17] stands now I didn't bring these because
[1:26:19] I told you I didn't want to bring a lot
[1:26:21] of thing but what about the the man out
[1:26:24] there is it um who is this Mel chz where
[1:26:29] anyhow brother Brandon would tells about
[1:26:30] the man with the Overcoat on that they
[1:26:32] saw the car run into him and went up in
[1:26:34] the air and flipped over you've heard
[1:26:36] the story amen right he said he between
[1:26:38] the two worlds well you know what that
[1:26:40] was that was between this world and that
[1:26:42] world that's right sure cuz they a seen
[1:26:45] the car
[1:26:46] lunge it was told years ago up here in
[1:26:48] Gainesville that there would be a a
[1:26:51] woman with a wedding dress be coming
[1:26:53] down the street they're coming where you
[1:26:55] go through Gainesville and you go around
[1:26:56] and j& J's over here and there's the
[1:26:58] cemetery and they would pick her up in
[1:27:00] town and she'd ride down and then they
[1:27:03] would she would have them to stop and
[1:27:04] they'd get out at the
[1:27:06] cemetery yeah you can say well I don't
[1:27:08] believe in all of
[1:27:11] that I do real I do I don't go around
[1:27:17] looking for it and every puff of cloud
[1:27:18] that goes by ain't a spook right all
[1:27:23] right you see something in it flashes
[1:27:25] it's a flash you know I mean what is it
[1:27:28] out in the desert out there they call it
[1:27:29] fox fire you know did you see this thing
[1:27:32] boy it's just dancing all over the place
[1:27:34] and all that it's fox fire they call it
[1:27:37] it ain't nothing
[1:27:39] real but you see what I'm trying to get
[1:27:41] you to see these things are real okay
[1:27:43] are you following me that's my point
[1:27:45] that's right get you to see the realness
[1:27:47] of what's going on but he goes on in
[1:27:50] that same message now to describe number
[1:27:52] 10 on your notes now the sixth Dimension
[1:27:54] is in Christ the Saints dead Saints are
[1:27:58] resting Saints now notice I like what he
[1:28:00] said the sixth Dimension is in Christ
[1:28:05] yeah okay now you know how that we've
[1:28:07] been doing chosen in Christ and how
[1:28:09] we've been bringing it down dead Saints
[1:28:12] are resting Saints who is
[1:28:15] completely work
[1:28:17] finished on Earth and has entered into
[1:28:20] rest with Christ under the altar
[1:28:23] beautifully you could parallel it like a
[1:28:25] wonderful dream that you didn't want to
[1:28:27] wake up it ain't a dream it's natural
[1:28:31] it's real but I'm just making a parable
[1:28:34] to you and of course the seventh
[1:28:36] Dimension is God
[1:28:40] alone right now you'll see the next one
[1:28:43] if you want to read it while it's up
[1:28:44] there number 11 on your notes is
[1:28:47] actually a repeat of number three you'll
[1:28:49] see written on the side of your thing so
[1:28:51] you read these they repeat cuz I wanted
[1:28:53] you to read them so you read them I
[1:28:55] don't have the time to but it goes back
[1:28:57] to number three to where they we're
[1:28:59] going to but look at number
[1:29:02] 12 which is
[1:29:04] 62908 present stage of my Ministry
[1:29:07] paragraph 25 to break it down when a man
[1:29:09] has a nightmare he's not altogether
[1:29:12] asleep neither is he's awake he's
[1:29:14] between sleep and awake and that's what
[1:29:16] makes him have a horrible shaking and
[1:29:18] screaming because he's not asleep he's
[1:29:21] not awake
[1:29:22] and to take that shows me where a man
[1:29:24] goes when he dies unconverted he's lived
[1:29:27] his time up he's dead on Earth and he
[1:29:29] cannot go into the in the presence of
[1:29:32] God because he's not fit to go there
[1:29:35] without the blood amen and he goes on
[1:29:37] down if you notice in the last part of
[1:29:39] it is underlined he said I believe I was
[1:29:41] caught in that sixth
[1:29:44] Dimension right so we're going to have
[1:29:47] to cover that a little bit when we get
[1:29:48] to it he said he was caught into the
[1:29:51] sixth dimension
[1:29:53] huh that's the sold under the altar
[1:29:55] right okay try to get in a hurry drop
[1:29:58] off the next two cuz they're
[1:30:03] repeats go to
[1:30:06] 15 the fifth seal 63
[1:30:10] 322 and I said well I don't understand
[1:30:12] this and this is brother brandham when
[1:30:15] he said he was in this went to sixth
[1:30:17] Dimension that's when I
[1:30:19] watching that voice talking to me
[1:30:22] I never could see the voice that was
[1:30:25] just above me talking to me I said well
[1:30:29] if I have if I have passed on I want to
[1:30:32] see Jesus I said I want I I he was so he
[1:30:37] was all my life I want to see him so he
[1:30:40] said you can't see him now he's still
[1:30:44] higher and this is Brother Rand beyond
[1:30:46] the curtain of time
[1:30:49] right see it was below the altar yet see
[1:30:53] the sixth place where man goes see not
[1:30:56] the seventh where God is seventh
[1:30:59] Dimension he said the sixth okay he goes
[1:31:03] on down and gives you another beyond the
[1:31:04] curtain of
[1:31:07] time 1961 303 paragraph 49 he talks
[1:31:12] about how the multitude comeing you know
[1:31:14] the different things were happening they
[1:31:16] saw the lady there that was 90 years old
[1:31:18] and all crying and said I asked oh where
[1:31:21] is Jesus I want to see him the people
[1:31:26] replied now the other was the angel
[1:31:29] replying now I'd like to spend the rest
[1:31:31] of the day talking right there the
[1:31:34] people they were already near theophany
[1:31:37] right they were in their word
[1:31:40] form Souls under the altar they knew too
[1:31:43] see the people replied he's just a
[1:31:46] little higher someday he will come to
[1:31:48] you you will sent as a leader and when
[1:31:51] God comes he he'll judge you according
[1:31:52] to your teaching I asked does Paul and
[1:31:54] Peter have to stand the Judgment also
[1:31:57] they answered the answer was yes you
[1:31:59] remember he screamed out right I
[1:32:01] preached exactly all right
[1:32:05] now I hope you see what I'm trying to
[1:32:08] say to
[1:32:09] you of each Dimension being real and you
[1:32:12] know I had no intentions of telling you
[1:32:15] in the beginning but I felt led that I
[1:32:17] had to to tell you that the eighth there
[1:32:21] is not eighth Dimension right the
[1:32:23] seventh Dimension is where God is at
[1:32:25] this time and that would be the souls
[1:32:28] under the altar is right down under
[1:32:30] there and he's
[1:32:32] there and you know waiting a time he's
[1:32:36] not a dead body laying out on the throne
[1:32:39] you know there's not so no such thing
[1:32:42] he's got a lot of work he's doing right
[1:32:44] he's doing the Plan of Redemption right
[1:32:47] now if you'll study the church ages and
[1:32:49] the things brother random covers you'll
[1:32:51] get a a whole lot better understanding
[1:32:53] because if you'll go in there and read
[1:32:54] of those things of the
[1:32:56] throne read the message the throne there
[1:32:59] is a message titled at the throne read
[1:33:01] that one especially where he covers the
[1:33:04] Altar and a Brazen Altar and he said
[1:33:07] when he gets into the souls under the
[1:33:09] altar under the fifth seal he covers it
[1:33:12] on the seal book that he said now these
[1:33:16] were Souls under the
[1:33:18] altar he said they was under this altar
[1:33:21] he said but mine was not under that
[1:33:23] altar they was under this see showing
[1:33:27] the difference between the Old Testament
[1:33:28] and the New Testament are the F seal Jew
[1:33:31] and the bride of Christ but there is an
[1:33:34] altar in heaven and one laying on the
[1:33:36] throne right now for you and I
[1:33:39] amen right it's real yes he's making
[1:33:44] intercession there's a throne read
[1:33:46] Revelations 4 Revelations 5 we've been
[1:33:49] through there Revelations 5 what four
[1:33:52] you don't see one necessarily on the
[1:33:54] throne Revelations 5 you see one sitting
[1:33:56] on the
[1:33:58] throne but then you got to see according
[1:34:01] to
[1:34:03] uh it's coming to me uh but said he
[1:34:07] climbs up the throne souls in prison
[1:34:10] page 26 I'm pretty sure he said he
[1:34:12] climbs upon the throne and sits down he
[1:34:14] said he becomes the one on the throne
[1:34:16] all of that's got to take place right
[1:34:19] cuz you remember when we were starting
[1:34:21] that we we can't go into his presence
[1:34:23] because he's still in Redemption that's
[1:34:25] correct we can't go into immortality
[1:34:28] because that would be mortal and
[1:34:29] immortality won't connect you can't do
[1:34:31] it you got to wait till a change comes
[1:34:33] to step into that presence right so then
[1:34:36] sold under the altar crying how long but
[1:34:40] there is a seventh Dimension to where
[1:34:42] that we would call it Heaven
[1:34:45] wonderful oh the Heavenly place is
[1:34:49] wonderful but it is a dimension it's a
[1:34:52] place for God to abide in at this time
[1:34:55] and the things are taking place I said
[1:34:57] if you would read those things read
[1:34:58] Revelations 4 and5 and all and look at
[1:35:01] the things that are that John saw in
[1:35:03] heaven cuz that's where he was taken up
[1:35:05] to see to that place where up into the
[1:35:08] to the seventh dimensional form you say
[1:35:10] well could he go up that way by
[1:35:15] Vision that'll be very important in a
[1:35:18] couple of messages down the road when we
[1:35:19] cover that brother brandham said I went
[1:35:21] to the first
[1:35:23] Heaven he said but Paul went to the
[1:35:26] Third
[1:35:30] Heaven Keep It In Mind no man has
[1:35:33] approached
[1:35:34] immortality but a prophet can go there
[1:35:36] by as I said a moment ago just
[1:35:39] listening he when he said I've been in
[1:35:41] both places he said I've been in the
[1:35:43] place of the lost and I've been in the
[1:35:44] place of the Blessed by being a prophet
[1:35:47] he could go there not as an intruder or
[1:35:50] a person that would be burning in a Hell
[1:35:53] right see but being a prophet God could
[1:35:57] transmit him to there amen he could do
[1:35:59] those things amen but you see then the
[1:36:02] life would be would be the not a
[1:36:06] dimension the heavens of Heavens you'll
[1:36:08] see this afternoon is not a
[1:36:13] dimension there is no ending to it there
[1:36:18] is no beginning to heaven right
[1:36:22] and I see it as a beautiful place that's
[1:36:25] right
[1:36:30] trees don't need no
[1:36:35] highways don't need them
[1:36:38] things you said but Brother D I just
[1:36:40] can't see how real heaven
[1:36:42] is I just can't fathom a heaven above
[1:36:46] something that you're saying above the
[1:36:47] seventh
[1:36:49] Dimension well
[1:36:52] I'll give you a scripture if you we'll
[1:36:54] cover it this
[1:36:56] afternoon you know we
[1:37:00] say that before the flood that there was
[1:37:03] no water in the
[1:37:07] atmosphere right you know that's true
[1:37:10] right but it didn't say there was no
[1:37:12] water in
[1:37:14] heaven because the Bible
[1:37:17] said he would divide the
[1:37:20] waters that
[1:37:22] were under
[1:37:25] heaven and above heaven so there was
[1:37:28] water in
[1:37:31] heaven but scientific man can't go no
[1:37:34] further than the seven
[1:37:39] dimensions he was
[1:37:45] talking science can't
[1:37:48] go no further than a dimensional no
[1:37:52] situation so we can't see even though
[1:37:55] the Bible said there was water up there
[1:37:58] s says there was no water up there and
[1:38:02] let me quote brother brand a scientific
[1:38:04] world back there and probably
[1:38:06] interplanetary travel was back before
[1:38:08] the flood it would not have bothered me
[1:38:11] none whatsoever had they landed on the
[1:38:13] moon or if they landed on Mars today and
[1:38:16] find a cubicle City sitting up there
[1:38:18] that wouldn't bother me none whatsoever
[1:38:20] i' shot Glory
[1:38:21] cuz the Bible says as it was in the days
[1:38:24] of you nothing new Ecclesiastes says
[1:38:28] under the sun right the things that have
[1:38:31] things that are have been so they had
[1:38:33] interplanetary travel that's
[1:38:36] right okay that's why I don't understand
[1:38:39] people you know that you never see U I'm
[1:38:43] saying something for a second then I'll
[1:38:44] get on the point you never see uh when
[1:38:47] they try to prove that there was some
[1:38:49] kind of a something going on is always
[1:38:51] drawings in the
[1:38:53] cave there's always been people that
[1:38:56] didn't know what was going
[1:38:59] on but if you'd never seen an aircraft
[1:39:03] and you was out in the middle of some
[1:39:05] jungle or something here comes an
[1:39:06] aircraft down and it lands and a guy
[1:39:08] gets out with a flamethrower and starts
[1:39:10] shooting it all around and all these
[1:39:11] things are happen you'd buy down and
[1:39:13] call him God wouldn't
[1:39:15] you then you go make a picture of
[1:39:18] him see they were scientific
[1:39:21] Before the
[1:39:24] Flood interplanetary travel would have
[1:39:26] truly been back there but now I want to
[1:39:29] say this a word to you and then you got
[1:39:31] the quotes to read it
[1:39:33] from brother around talking about
[1:39:35] eternal life I was in my father and my
[1:39:39] grandfather
[1:39:40] great-grandfather we don't have to put
[1:39:42] these up until we click over to the
[1:39:43] light for Richard but everybody can read
[1:39:46] it when I in my father in thanks go over
[1:39:51] to number 20
[1:39:53] Richard guess heant no he had clicked
[1:39:55] there yet go to number
[1:39:58] 20 cuz this is what I tried to explain
[1:40:04] Wednesday tried to explain something to
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:07] Wednesday so I believe eternal
[1:40:11] life is
[1:40:13] real
[1:40:16] right now you can believe what you want
[1:40:17] to but you're Prophet when it said it in
[1:40:19] token 1964 to 8 paragraph 192 if God
[1:40:23] would have spoke to me back before the
[1:40:25] foundation of the world when I was a
[1:40:28] thought in his
[1:40:32] mind so were
[1:40:34] you if he just said what age would you
[1:40:37] want to live in I'd have said this right
[1:40:40] now it's the most glorious time there
[1:40:44] is he explains the next one that the
[1:40:48] only way you'll ever know anything is to
[1:40:49] understand the Spears of the
[1:40:51] spirituality of the inward
[1:40:55] man look at the last one number
[1:41:00] 23 Satan's Eden 1965
[1:41:03] 829 so God knew that we would be here
[1:41:07] but then he put us in
[1:41:10] flesh so we would be
[1:41:14] contacted in order to be
[1:41:16] contacted he became one of us when he
[1:41:19] became Jesus Christ as Son of God
[1:41:21] himself the fullness of the
[1:41:22] manifestation of God therefore that was
[1:41:25] God's purpose to display his attributes
[1:41:28] in Fellowship when I was in my father I
[1:41:31] knew nothing about it but when I became
[1:41:34] his son and was born to him I was an
[1:41:38] attribute a part of my father and you're
[1:41:41] a part of your father and as children of
[1:41:44] God we are children we are a part of
[1:41:46] God's attribute that was in him made
[1:41:50] flesh like he was made flesh so we can
[1:41:53] have Fellowship one with the other as a
[1:41:55] family of God upon the Earth and that
[1:41:58] was God's purpose at the beginning yes
[1:42:01] sir that's what God wanted at the
[1:42:04] beginning he had everything under
[1:42:06] control he turned man over to it in the
[1:42:08] Garden of Eden on freem moral agency
[1:42:11] said son is
[1:42:12] yours I was
[1:42:15] looking you can go through the next one
[1:42:17] back behind it on Satan's Eden or
[1:42:19] brother man Zach he says they actually
[1:42:23] uh you know know nothing about
[1:42:26] it but he said your father long for you
[1:42:29] to come right now he's talking about
[1:42:32] natural now he's only typing that's what
[1:42:35] I was trying to get across Wednesday
[1:42:38] right you see putting it in because I'm
[1:42:40] talking about
[1:42:44] heaven not a
[1:42:47] dimension to blank it off not a
[1:42:49] dimmension hey
[1:42:52] Heaven all
[1:42:54] right and up in
[1:42:58] heaven see there's no way brother collie
[1:43:00] that you could want to fellowship with
[1:43:02] your natural children that's only a
[1:43:06] story true amen come on all we want to
[1:43:10] do
[1:43:11] was what is it
[1:43:14] procreate all right we had no thoughts
[1:43:18] as I was trying to illustrate Wednesday
[1:43:20] with brother dick and sister Gail that
[1:43:22] if you had three and knew that was going
[1:43:23] to be then you could long on those three
[1:43:26] but we can't humanly do that
[1:43:31] right we only come by
[1:43:33] procreation we only come from desires
[1:43:37] you want to call that desires well I had
[1:43:38] desires from to be a daddy well that's
[1:43:40] all right but you didn't know about
[1:43:42] being a father you didn't know where's
[1:43:43] going to be a you didn't know where it
[1:43:45] was going to be a boy or a girl or what
[1:43:47] it was going to
[1:43:48] be right but it's not so with God
[1:43:52] that's right not
[1:43:55] so God knew exactly how many children he
[1:43:58] was going to have and what they were
[1:44:00] going to be y amen why can't we look
[1:44:03] back and see that he asked
[1:44:06] us where would you like to
[1:44:12] be why can't you
[1:44:16] see
[1:44:18] that God looking down through
[1:44:21] time remember this started on the day of
[1:44:24] Pentecost now we're not talking about
[1:44:25] the Old Testament we're not talking
[1:44:26] about all those other we're talking
[1:44:27] about the kingdom of God
[1:44:29] righten and he looks down and he sees oh
[1:44:33] Paul he says Paul where would you like
[1:44:35] to
[1:44:38] be well you know my
[1:44:42] ways yep and you'll fit down on the
[1:44:49] body you you said no no no you're making
[1:44:51] eternal life too much of a
[1:44:56] reality
[1:45:01] oh what would you like to
[1:45:04] be well if you don't want to I'll just
[1:45:07] place you in
[1:45:09] place so Paul your nature and your ways
[1:45:12] will fit right
[1:45:15] here you said now you're making eternal
[1:45:17] life in nature and ways why can't I make
[1:45:19] it his nature in his
[1:45:22] ways I thought we believed an attribute
[1:45:24] was of nature I thought we proved the
[1:45:27] point he said Luther I need a man to
[1:45:31] stand out and protest the
[1:45:34] world he said I'll take that
[1:45:40] place CU
[1:45:43] remember the seed comes predestinated
[1:45:46] eternally not the human body right so he
[1:45:50] said all right your name on Earth will
[1:45:52] be Luther but it's not
[1:45:54] that we'll cover that he said will you
[1:45:57] when we get through with the
[1:45:59] journey but your name will be Martin
[1:46:03] Luther you will
[1:46:06] protest who done the
[1:46:09] protested
[1:46:11] Christ who was that Christ who was that
[1:46:15] in Paul
[1:46:16] Christ Iranians Martin Columbo Luther
[1:46:20] wesle
[1:46:23] Elijah I thought we dwelt in the last
[1:46:25] days that Elijah would have
[1:46:27] the the nature and ways of the great
[1:46:30] Elijah that was back
[1:46:34] there but see that was part to do with
[1:46:36] William
[1:46:39] brandham on
[1:46:42] Earth but can't you just
[1:46:48] see he says I'll send you to Earth
[1:46:53] Earth there's going to be a fall C
[1:46:55] remember the prior message to
[1:47:00] this the morning star sang together sons
[1:47:02] of God shouted for Joy why when they
[1:47:04] seen the Plan of Redemption come into
[1:47:06] view you mean that that we just see it
[1:47:09] as a shouting down here where's your
[1:47:11] matching pieces that's 20 years what 10
[1:47:14] years ago matching
[1:47:19] pieces see when Martin Luther match what
[1:47:21] was in heaven they wouldn't but one
[1:47:23] thing that man could do protest that
[1:47:24] Catholic
[1:47:25] church and do what he's supposed to do
[1:47:28] cuz that was the
[1:47:30] Christ each one of those Believers down
[1:47:32] through time now where are you at that's
[1:47:35] right why are you the
[1:47:38] last brother ROM said I want to be here
[1:47:40] because of the great glorious things
[1:47:42] that's taking place but why do you want
[1:47:45] to be
[1:47:46] here I want to be here to glorify my
[1:47:49] father amen am that's right I want my
[1:47:53] father to get
[1:47:54] Glory that's the glory the honor and
[1:47:57] all CU it ain't been a man it's been
[1:48:02] Christ so I didn't finish up what I'm
[1:48:04] talking about I just walked down and
[1:48:05] tried to illustrate a little bit with
[1:48:08] you cuz you remember now may I say it
[1:48:12] again my children was in me right yes
[1:48:16] but I couldn't fellowship with them yes
[1:48:18] and I didn't know they were in there as
[1:48:19] two boys boys and a girl right my wife
[1:48:22] Mis cared 2 three times what are you
[1:48:25] going to deal with I didn't know that
[1:48:27] and I didn't have no desire for them to
[1:48:30] it wasn't a desire in my body to
[1:48:33] fellowship with my children at that time
[1:48:35] was it in you no you were just getting
[1:48:37] mad having a good time and enjoyed
[1:48:39] everything letting the harmones
[1:48:43] run but say it's not so with God right
[1:48:47] he knew exactly every age
[1:48:51] he know exactly what you and I would
[1:48:53] look like he knew exactly our nature and
[1:48:56] our ways he knows exactly how to deal
[1:48:58] with
[1:49:00] us right he knows exactly how to deal
[1:49:04] with us our natur and our ways but you
[1:49:07] know sometimes they got to
[1:49:10] change that's right you
[1:49:14] know there was a day when a man sitting
[1:49:17] right back
[1:49:19] there
[1:49:21] I know him a couple of
[1:49:23] weeks he was tough as
[1:49:27] Sho I walked up to him and I rubed him
[1:49:30] oh he I twist him around do it I said
[1:49:33] you need a cup of coffee and it's going
[1:49:36] to be extra
[1:49:42] sugar this man sitting right here told
[1:49:46] me he said you better leave him
[1:49:48] alone he said he's mean
[1:49:51] he said he'll hurt you but you see I
[1:49:53] wouldn't have done this to brother dick
[1:49:55] that day but I can
[1:50:01] now see changes things takes place
[1:50:04] that's right you don't fool me on
[1:50:07] nature and
[1:50:10] ways I look down at every one of you and
[1:50:12] find a nature that I like thank you Lord
[1:50:15] find a lot of things I don't
[1:50:17] like but I find something I like right
[1:50:21] and I deal with you according to that
[1:50:24] nature that's
[1:50:27] right never been wrong
[1:50:32] yet CU I look down inside of you I don't
[1:50:35] look at your outside if I looked the
[1:50:37] outside I'd killed every one of us by
[1:50:38] the word right but I don't do it let's
[1:50:43] stand together I'm sorry a little bit
[1:50:44] late I want to get that last part just a
[1:50:47] little bit I believe in God being real
[1:50:51] I believe that he had a desires and
[1:50:53] those desires inside of him was
[1:50:57] me inside of him was a desire to come
[1:51:00] forth to be and that was me
[1:51:03] right and we're not the
[1:51:06] same and we're not the same in
[1:51:10] eternity we're a body of
[1:51:13] Christ you remember the other week I
[1:51:15] tried to express those we're a body of
[1:51:17] Christ then let me act like the that I
[1:51:23] am well you're thinking of eternal life
[1:51:25] it's just everybody being the same
[1:51:29] no right God knew what it would take to
[1:51:32] be in this hour yep that's and he put
[1:51:35] you
[1:51:36] here to face this situation in this
[1:51:39] hour why can't we realize that right
[1:51:43] Paul can't come and take your place am I
[1:51:45] quoting brother
[1:51:47] Brown can't do it
[1:51:50] no no way for it to be done what we got
[1:51:52] brother 204
[1:51:54] 204 anybody have a
[1:52:02] need there is
