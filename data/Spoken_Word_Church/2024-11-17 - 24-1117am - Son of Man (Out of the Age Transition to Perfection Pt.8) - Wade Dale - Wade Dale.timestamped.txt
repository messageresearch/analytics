[41:40] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[41:42] proud yeah all that do wickly shall be
[41:44] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[41:46] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[41:47] that it shall leave them neither root
[41:50] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[41:52] name shall the son of righteousness
[41:55] arise with healing in his wings and you
[41:57] shall go forth and grow up as cows of
[41:59] the stall what a positive attitude that
[42:02] this should be for us cuz listen folks
[42:04] this is our
[42:05] scripture okay and ye shall tread down
[42:08] the wicked for they shall be ashes Under
[42:10] The Souls of your feet and the day that
[42:11] I shall do this sayth the Lord of host
[42:14] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[42:16] remember Jesus Christ didn't do away
[42:19] with the law he magnified it and made it
[42:21] where you could live it everybody with
[42:24] me that's what he he came under the law
[42:26] to get us from under the law but the law
[42:28] was not you can't do away with the Old
[42:31] Testament so Malachi is telling us to
[42:33] remember you the law of Moses my servant
[42:35] which I commanded unto him in horor for
[42:37] all Israel with the statutes and
[42:39] judgments Now Behold I will send you
[42:42] somebody say you you thank you you
[42:44] talking to me behold I will send you
[42:47] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[42:48] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[42:50] and he shall turn the heart of the
[42:51] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[42:53] the children to their fathers lest I
[42:55] come and smite the Earth with the curse
[42:57] you may be SE the Lord has his
[43:00] Blessing before we get started I want to
[43:02] I want to read
[43:06] something that we need to be aware
[43:09] of not I'm not trying to be
[43:13] political but we live under political
[43:17] government do you know that Trump told
[43:19] the Christians if they'd vote for him
[43:20] they' never have you never have to vote
[43:23] again uh let me read that July the 27th
[43:28] Republican presidential candidate Donald
[43:29] Trump told Christians on Friday if they
[43:31] vote for him in December in four years
[43:34] you won't have to vote
[43:35] again we'll have it fixed so good you're
[43:38] not going to have to
[43:41] vote he added I love you Christians I'm
[43:44] a Christian I love you get out you got
[43:46] to get out and vote in four years you
[43:48] don't have to vote again we'll have it
[43:50] fixed so good you're not going to have
[43:51] to vote that's
[43:54] right I hope we ain't hear four
[43:57] years but now n no Christians will be
[44:00] here in four years they'll be here for a
[44:02] while cuz they're not going to make the
[44:03] Rapture what we've been talking about
[44:05] with the foolish virgin and the wise
[44:07] virgin to be a lamp trimming time but
[44:09] just just beware be
[44:12] cautious everybody's caught up
[44:14] everybody's drunk with with Trump
[44:18] now just be cautious we're Christians
[44:22] we're the real Christians if he's a
[44:24] Christian I'm the Pope
[44:27] I'm sorry there's nothing moral about
[44:30] the person there's nothing moral about
[44:32] this
[44:33] world this world is doomed that's why
[44:37] that he tells us right here in the
[44:38] scriptures in Revelations well you know
[44:41] what Revelations 10:7 but Revelation 18
[44:43] for all nations now watch all nations
[44:46] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[44:47] her fornication which is who her is Rome
[44:51] right right and the kings of the Earth
[44:53] have committed fornication with her and
[44:55] the merchants of the Earth
[44:57] right right
[45:00] ecclesiastical commercial that's right
[45:03] just like Constantine that's right
[45:05] brought them together and the merchants
[45:07] of the Earth are waxed Rich through the
[45:10] abundance of her Delicacies and I heard
[45:13] another voice thank God for another
[45:15] voice yes sir you can say Amen today if
[45:17] you want to thank God for another voice
[45:20] that we heard behold I will send you
[45:22] Elijah the prophet hallu in the days of
[45:24] the voice of that man you're going to
[45:26] hear from me God said you're not going
[45:27] to hear this garbage is going around all
[45:29] over the world you're going to hear
[45:30] straight from me yes sir I hope today
[45:33] you come expecting to hear from God not
[45:35] from me cuz it will be a failure if you
[45:37] come to hear from
[45:38] me and I heard another voice from Heaven
[45:41] saying come out of her my
[45:44] people that you be not partakers of her
[45:46] sins and that you receive not of her
[45:48] plagues you see all the plagues that's
[45:50] fallen for her sins have reached into
[45:52] heaven for God hath remembered her
[45:55] iniquities rewarded her reward her even
[45:57] as she rewarded you and double unto her
[46:00] listen we got a double portion of the
[46:02] word of God Amen that's right right
[46:05] since we're the Elisha we got a double
[46:07] portion from Brother Brown's Ministry we
[46:09] got a double portion of it right don't
[46:11] get quiet on me we got a double portion
[46:14] well guess what God's going to give a
[46:16] double portion to them people out there
[46:17] that reject it too this nation's doomed
[46:20] I don't carees like brother Bob said the
[46:22] other day it don't matter what happens
[46:24] there's not anything positive going to
[46:26] White House it's going to save us it's
[46:28] going to make it better but I'll promise
[46:29] you in the next several months you're
[46:31] going to see Prosperity like you've
[46:33] never seen
[46:34] before people are going to get on board
[46:37] they're going to get on board and and
[46:38] the Christians are going to do their
[46:40] thing the nominal Christians but we have
[46:42] got to as uh this message came as I
[46:45] driving down the road coming back home
[46:47] uh Saturday night to come out of that
[46:50] yes that's right we don't listen we
[46:53] can't put oursel in a commune come on we
[46:56] kill each other at this
[46:59] point but when we get to heaven we're
[47:01] all going to live together but we're all
[47:03] in our humanity and uh you're not going
[47:06] to no commune is not a way to go but we
[47:09] are going to be what United under one
[47:12] head I'll promise you the bride will be
[47:15] United under one headship yes sir when
[47:18] that head says arm move whoever the arm
[47:20] is that arm will move whoever says
[47:23] finger move which is we know as the Lord
[47:25] we know the headship of Christ is he
[47:26] here yes under the word of God I believe
[47:29] that I don't believe there's another
[47:30] head coming I don't believe there's
[47:32] another message
[47:33] coming there's not another Prophet
[47:35] coming to us now there's one going to
[47:37] Israel but not one coming to us right
[47:39] amen so the world is going to be
[47:41] rewarded double and brother Bri talked
[47:43] about America turning the word
[47:46] down God sent us a prophet in our
[47:50] language yes our language so that we all
[47:54] can understand it right and what do we
[47:56] done with
[47:58] it the world's turned it down nominal
[48:01] Christianity has turned it down amen so
[48:05] you're going to get double according to
[48:06] her
[48:08] words look at acts 16:16 I just want to
[48:10] take my pretense from right here and go
[48:13] forward with it and it came to pass as
[48:16] we went to to prayer brother Bob was
[48:18] talking about the Sorcerer And all all
[48:20] that stuff hangs around remember Judas
[48:23] and Jesus hung around each
[48:25] other right no no one knew who Judas was
[48:28] except Jesus and he was the son of man
[48:31] he was the word the other 11 had no clue
[48:34] who he was all right so it came to pass
[48:37] as we went to prayer a certain damsel
[48:39] possessed with the spirit of divination
[48:41] met us which brought her Masters much
[48:43] gain by what Soo saying we don't have
[48:46] soothsayers in this message we have
[48:48] people that have thus sayth the Lord in
[48:50] this message I believe that brother R
[48:52] said we'll have thus sayith the Lord and
[48:53] we'll quit or we quit we won't talk
[48:55] we'll be still but I believe we have
[48:57] thus sayith the Lord everything we're
[48:59] talking about now is thus sayith the
[49:00] Lord because it comes straight out of
[49:01] the Bible
[49:03] right the same followed Paul and us and
[49:06] cried saying these men are the Servants
[49:08] of the most high God which show unto us
[49:10] the way of Salvation and this did she
[49:13] many days but Paul being grieved now
[49:16] watch turned and said to the spirit he
[49:18] didn't say to the
[49:20] woman he said to the spirit I command
[49:23] thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come
[49:25] out of her
[49:28] and he came out the same
[49:29] hour that's what we're doing today
[49:32] folks we're preaching the word of God
[49:35] trying to drive those demons you see I
[49:37] don't have demons you already got
[49:39] one of
[49:42] deception we all have them we got them
[49:44] hanging around and we need to get rid of
[49:46] them amen we need to say in the name of
[49:49] the Lord Jesus Christ whatever you got
[49:50] problem you got today cast it out you
[49:53] don't need a preacher to come cast it
[49:55] out for you you don't need a prophet to
[49:57] come back and cast it out for
[49:59] you you say unto this mountain be moved
[50:03] that's what we're heading toward folks
[50:04] let me tell you something we got to up
[50:06] at a notch yes right right yeah we do I
[50:09] was coming down the road and I've been
[50:11] listening to the seals for Years brother

[50:16] had it on and my the second and third
[50:19] seal I got more out of that than I'd
[50:20] ever got before but it wasn't time then
[50:22] it's time now you and I have got to come
[50:25] to a time though but you got to realize
[50:27] one thing we've went through
[50:29] justification I'll read it if I have
[50:30] time we've went through sanctification
[50:33] we've went through the baptism of the
[50:35] Holy Ghost now we are in the Incarnate

[50:41] age sir that's no fooling around that's
[50:44] Incarnate Word age you can have the Holy
[50:47] Ghost that's okay that's good but what

[51:17] says amen hallelujah listen to this
[51:23] invisible Union brother Brand This is a
[51:26] thanks message that he had in sort but
[51:28] one of the greatest most powerful

[53:18] marry to the new anointed word for their
[53:22] age when those pilgrims hit Plymouth
[53:24] Rock they were anointed to be in America
[53:28] we listen I'm sorry do we believe was a
[53:31] prophet are we in the right are we in
[53:32] the right place okay we do believe
[53:34] brother Brown was a prophet right okay
[53:36] and what he said was true okay just want
[53:38] to make sure nobody left and come back
[53:40] brought somebody else with them they
[53:42] could marry to the new anointed word for
[53:44] their age that's right the new anointed
[53:46] word of their age for their
[53:49] day justification was fine in its day
[53:52] sanctification was listen it was fine in
[53:54] your day but you got to get out of it
[53:58] you got to keep moving cuz God moved the
[54:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's moved
[54:02] from just the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:04] to the very word incarnate
[54:06] yes what was Jesus Jesus do he he he
[54:10] wasn't just the Holy
[54:12] Ghost he was incarnate
[54:15] God he was God walking around in human
[54:18] flesh what are
[54:21] we and the Word was made flesh D my old
[54:24] brother wait that was back in Jesus's
[54:26] time he made a way for it to be in our
[54:28] time and he sent us a prophet to open
[54:31] the book to reveal that it was in our
[54:33] time and that we can live it amen
[54:37] amen I can't W I ever help
[54:40] you I can't well maybe you can't but God
[54:44] can't if you give it to him Hallelujah
[54:46] as brother Joe was saying let him fight
[54:48] for you he said he'd fight we got to
[54:50] quit fighting
[54:52] him that's right that's right remember
[54:55] the old man met the met the old brother
[54:57] and said well H old brother said I'm a
[54:59] Christian said said uh the other brother
[55:01] said well how long you been in this
[55:02] blessed way he said all about 45 years
[55:05] been this blessed way about 45 years
[55:08] that old man looked at him and said
[55:09] that's your problem you've been in the
[55:10] way for 45
[55:12] years Hallelujah maybe I'll keep you
[55:15] awake for a little while so can we be
[55:17] thankful as pilgrims now he's bringing
[55:20] us back as pilgrims oh yeah like Abraham
[55:23] separated ourself from the things of the
[55:25] world all of our
[55:28] Associates can we do
[55:31] that can we separate ourselves from the
[55:34] world we have to live in it but not be
[55:38] of
[55:39] it Abraham was a pilgrim God has
[55:43] separated us from all the dead

[55:50] the Nation now all the dead Creeds and
[55:52] to what separated us and open to us a
[55:56] new land a new message for this day yes

[56:03] sir Pentecost dried up and died like
[56:06] Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's
[56:08] no more than a bunch of churches pulled
[56:10] together and guess what they're going to
[56:12] pull
[56:14] together you watch church and States
[56:16] coming back together
[56:18] again Constantine put them together back
[56:20] there and you know who's going to put
[56:21] them together now

[56:28] religion Satan loves them
[56:31] all separated us and opened to us a new
[56:33] land a new message for this day
[56:35] Pentecost dried up and died like Luther
[56:37] Wesley and the rest of them it's no more
[56:39] than a bunch of churches good people in
[56:42] there yet has got to come out right see
[56:46] like brother Herman Garland he might
[56:47] have did you ever go to brother Bri's
[56:49] meeting were you in but you were in
[56:50] Pentecost all right yeah see he was in
[56:52] Pentecost he was waiting that time to
[56:54] hear that message though when he he
[56:56] heard that voice Pentecost wasn't there
[56:58] anymore he had a new Pentecostal
[57:01] experience he had the real Pentecost
[57:03] give me the real
[57:05] Pentecost right but he was just this is
[57:08] what this is a quote that he was setting
[57:10] in he was setting in Pentecost waiting
[57:13] for this message to cross his path good
[57:15] people in there yet has got to come out
[57:19] if you're a true seed of God you will
[57:20] come you can't be in a denomination and
[57:22] be a true seed of God you can't do it
[57:25] and listen to be the Incarnate Word
[57:27] you're going to separate from a lot of
[57:28] people in so-called message oh yes
[57:32] sir I'll say am man
[57:37] myself what did he do he opened up the
[57:40] Seven Seals of the last message that's
[57:42] our key we are not closed book people we
[57:47] are open book people with every
[57:49] Revelation every mystery everything that
[57:52] we need is right here in our in our
[57:54] right in our hands
[57:57] you got on your
[58:00] phone you notice that the Seven Seals
[58:02] which all the mysteries of the seven
[58:04] Church Ages was sealed with Seven Seals
[58:07] the reformers didn't have time to do it
[58:09] in their day they didn't live long
[58:12] enough but this blessed revelation of
[58:14] the Seven Seals is open to us in this
[58:17] last day amen everybody with
[58:21] me but now remember we were talking
[58:23] about last Sunday
[58:26] Elijah said if you can see me
[58:29] leave all right if you can see me go
[58:32] I'll give you a double portion right
[58:35] right now brother collie we've seen him
[58:40] leave and if your Revelations he's got
[58:43] to come back that's okay fine with me
[58:44] you have it but I'm not waiting on him
[58:47] Elisha didn't Elisha took that Manel
[58:50] smed it and said where be the god of
[58:51] Elijah walked out and did eight Miracles
[58:53] eight more or did more than Elijah did
[58:56] and you know what he done he separated
[58:58] from that group of prophets who been
[58:59] hanging around him hello remember the
[59:01] school of prophets them boys that were
[59:03] prophets they were
[59:05] false right right he separated himself
[59:08] from that you and I got to separate
[59:09] oursel from the past that we've done not
[59:11] our past life I hope that's already done
[59:13] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[59:16] thank you Lord but you got to separate
[59:17] yourself from that thing that's been
[59:18] dragging along with you like Paul had to
[59:20] do right and each one of us have one
[59:24] right and it came to pass
[59:26] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[59:28] taken away and Elisha said I pray thee
[59:30] let a double portion of thy Spirit be
[59:31] upon me now what was the
[59:35] stipulation he had to see him
[59:38] leave he had to see him
[59:40] leave and he had to know that he left
[59:43] cuz there was a group of people came to
[59:44] him right after that the next day or so
[59:46] and said where's Elijah we're going to
[59:49] go look for him Elisha said go right
[59:51] ahead but you're not going to find him
[59:53] that's why I tell people now you go
[59:54] ahead and look for brother random you
[59:56] not going to find
[59:57] him his message is in his people yes sir

[1:00:08] going to bring the dead out of the
[1:00:09] ground you're the one that's going to
[1:00:10] bring William Bram out of the
[1:00:15] ground oh I I you know you look at that
[1:00:19] day that when Jesus resurrected and the
[1:00:21] two angels are sitting there you know
[1:00:23] and Mary and Martha whoever it is comes
[1:00:24] in and looks and says where's
[1:00:28] Jesus we thought he was
[1:00:31] dead remember what the angel said why
[1:00:35] seek
[1:00:37] ye the living among the dead why are we
[1:00:41] seeking the living among the dead that
[1:00:43] we've all been through all of us has
[1:00:45] been through something but we got to
[1:00:48] come out of that come into this new
[1:00:50] Thanksgiving we're going to have turkey
[1:00:52] and dressing well let's get the word of
[1:00:54] God right first and then we can have our
[1:00:56] turkey and
[1:00:57] dressing I'm not saying we're wrong I'm
[1:00:59] just telling you we got to step it up a
[1:01:01] little bit amen somebody was saying the
[1:01:03] other day you know the the Bible says
[1:01:05] that that people have said all since the
[1:01:07] dawn of time brother brother Joie that
[1:01:10] that the Lord's coming since the dawn of
[1:01:13] time and well Grandma said he was coming
[1:01:17] grandpa said he was coming I'll promise
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:21] folks they're all gone right amen some
[1:01:25] of you sitting here to today are going
[1:01:26] to see that coming to the Lord you're
[1:01:29] going to see that thing being fulfilled
[1:01:31] but you got to say that's me that's not
[1:01:34] for
[1:01:35] Grandma you got to make it personal
[1:01:37] that's for
[1:01:39] me but we got to start acting like it
[1:01:41] like brother Bob said church is
[1:01:44] important yes if it wasn't brother
[1:01:46] Brandon wouldn't tell you
[1:01:48] that if you were a Christian you
[1:01:50] couldn't wait for the doors to open
[1:01:52] that's right so you could U press play
[1:01:57] so you could talk to God if thou see me
[1:02:00] when I am taken from thee it shall be so
[1:02:02] unto thee but if not it shall not
[1:02:06] be so we're moving on
[1:02:10] right so now this messenger is going to
[1:02:12] do two things we've talked about the
[1:02:14] layout of seean age we know what it is
[1:02:16] listen as we went through all those
[1:02:18] Church ages we had to give you history
[1:02:21] right we had to give you what this one
[1:02:23] said about Luther what this one said
[1:02:24] about Wesley and what this said about
[1:02:26] this the commentators right cuz they
[1:02:28] were all
[1:02:29] gone now brother bram's gone but we've
[1:02:31] got his message yes that we know that
[1:02:34] this is it amen there's no more you're
[1:02:37] living in it
[1:02:39] absolutely so I don't have to read that
[1:02:41] all I don't have to read
[1:02:43] that stuff that we have to go through in
[1:02:45] the lukewarm and neither hot nor cold
[1:02:49] and y'all know that you're sitting in it
[1:02:52] some of y'all are
[1:02:54] lukewarm that there we arms folded and
[1:02:56] can't can't even worship when somebody
[1:02:59] says
[1:03:00] Worship You worship God don't worship
[1:03:03] the next person beside
[1:03:05] you sorry about that but it's truth
[1:03:08] anyhow maybe it'll make your potatoes
[1:03:10] taste better now this messenger of
[1:03:13] Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 is going
[1:03:16] to do two things so we've got a
[1:03:17] messenger that didn't just do one
[1:03:20] thing Luther come and preach
[1:03:22] justification when off the scene he
[1:03:25] wasn't requireed ired to preach am I
[1:03:27] doing okay preach sanctification all
[1:03:30] right I'm talking about The Interpreter
[1:03:32] Sister Christine slows me down and
[1:03:34] sister Regina slows me down when I'm
[1:03:36] when I'm going too fast we sure want
[1:03:38] them to to understand and we don't want
[1:03:40] brother Lise to blow a fuse in that room
[1:03:42] in there his fuse not a fuse in the
[1:03:45] church his
[1:03:46] fuse just pray for brother Louise he
[1:03:48] preaches all the
[1:03:50] time he's back there behind the scene
[1:03:52] preaching all the time
[1:03:56] and I praise God that that he's a
[1:03:58] wonderful preacher and that he can catch
[1:04:00] the mind of God I'm sorry but better
[1:04:02] than a
[1:04:03] leoty cuz he's used to preaching he
[1:04:05] knows the way it's going to go and so so
[1:04:08] Brother Carlos God bless y'all thank you
[1:04:10] for bringing that out of brother Louise
[1:04:12] we got a lot of different languages in
[1:04:13] here
[1:04:14] today but we got one God we got one
[1:04:18] message
[1:04:20] am so this messenger of Malachi 4 is
[1:04:22] going to do two things now watch one
[1:04:24] according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the
[1:04:26] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:04:27] now look what was that doing that was
[1:04:29] taking justification sanctification the
[1:04:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost as it fell on
[1:04:34] the day of Pentecost and bringing us
[1:04:36] back to that that's right the right way
[1:04:38] of doing it not that you speak in
[1:04:40] tongues you got the Holy Ghost Devils do
[1:04:42] the same thing that's right you can be
[1:04:44] justified without being Sanctified you
[1:04:47] can be Sanctified without being filled
[1:04:48] with the Holy Ghost that's a direct
[1:04:50] quote from brother randam because I had
[1:04:51] it on the third seal I think it was
[1:04:53] coming down the road but you look and
[1:04:56] see that brother randam as we were
[1:04:58] talking about Elijah remember on Mount
[1:05:00] Carmel Elijah stood there and he
[1:05:04] mocked the religion of the
[1:05:09] day oh he's on
[1:05:11] vacation maybe you need to holler a
[1:05:13] little
[1:05:16] louder but what did they do they tore
[1:05:18] that altar down and Elijah put that
[1:05:21] thing back together Revelation by
[1:05:23] Revelation Stone by Stone Stone he put
[1:05:26] that altar back together William brandom
[1:05:28] during his first part of his ministry
[1:05:30] that's what he did he brought the people
[1:05:33] back to believe that you got to be
[1:05:35] justified but you can't stay that way
[1:05:37] you got to be Sanctified but you can't
[1:05:38] stay that way you got to get the Holy
[1:05:40] Ghost apart from
[1:05:43] any emotion
[1:05:46] right amen huh yes sir that's right I
[1:05:50] had a feeling I can pour water down your
[1:05:52] back and get a feeling that's what
[1:05:54] brother Dale always said you put down
[1:05:55] your back I get I get cold chills no
[1:06:00] doubt but brother Ram then when he come
[1:06:03] to the second part of his ministry
[1:06:04] though he kept bring he always said
[1:06:06] three three God is in three right God is
[1:06:09] in threes God is in threes God is in
[1:06:12] threes but then he comes up and and when
[1:06:14] he comes up to about the spoken words
[1:06:16] Original Seed I'll read it to you in a
[1:06:17] minute he talks about
[1:06:20] four restoration of the brid tree he
[1:06:23] talks about four manifest
[1:06:27] ation justification sanctification
[1:06:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word
[1:06:32] now wasn't it the word wasn't here but
[1:06:34] it's the fullness the Incarnate of the
[1:06:36] word so one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:06:39] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:06:40] fathers I pray today that you have been
[1:06:42] turned back amen you got to know that
[1:06:45] yourself that you've been turned back
[1:06:47] from that Old way you used to
[1:06:50] be yes sir so that was the first part of
[1:06:53] his ministry that was his brother said
[1:06:55] not in the years of preparation that was
[1:06:57] in the years of preparation he was
[1:06:59] getting the listen if you don't have the
[1:07:00] Holy Ghost today you're not going to
[1:07:02] understand what I'm saying right you can
[1:07:04] get a feeling or you can get an
[1:07:05] intellectual conception or you can say I
[1:07:08] think I know what he's talking about but
[1:07:10] if you got the Holy Ghost the word of
[1:07:12] God is prevalent in your life you will
[1:07:15] understand what's going on God's
[1:07:17] obligated to give it to you yes
[1:07:20] sir
[1:07:21] amen so the second part of his ministry
[1:07:24] according to Revel Gans 10:7 he's going
[1:07:27] to reveal something not
[1:07:30] different but
[1:07:32] total not something different but
[1:07:35] something total something to give you
[1:07:37] Perfection something to make you act
[1:07:39] different the Holy Ghost ought to make
[1:07:41] you act different anyway listen
[1:07:42] sanctification ought to make you act
[1:07:44] different right that's why a lot of
[1:07:46] people get hung you know me if you've
[1:07:48] listened to me many years sanctification
[1:07:50] is a wonderful place to be but is a
[1:07:51] horrible place to be and stay right amen
[1:07:56] uhhuh well I don't smoke anymore I don't
[1:07:59] drink
[1:08:01] anymore I don't do this anymore I even
[1:08:04] go to church so did
[1:08:07] Judas Judas had
[1:08:13] sanctification God cleaned his life up
[1:08:15] as far as he
[1:08:17] could come on
[1:08:19] people Jesus said sanctify them through
[1:08:22] thy truth Thy word is truth and Judas
[1:08:24] was standing there right brother Rand
[1:08:26] many many times he'll tell you Judas was
[1:08:29] was justified and
[1:08:31] Sanctified nobody knew who he was though
[1:08:34] except the son of man
[1:08:37] nobody he had deceived everybody but the
[1:08:40] son of man he did not receive Jes
[1:08:42] deceive Jesus Jesus knew from the
[1:08:44] beginning that he was the son of
[1:08:46] predition that's what brother Brown said
[1:08:47] in the third seal I believe it was so
[1:08:49] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:08:51] seven Thunders now don't get all don't
[1:08:53] get all we're we're going to talk about
[1:08:55] the Thunders here in a little bit we're

[1:11:27] said I don't think I just don't think
[1:11:30] I'm going to go to church
[1:11:31] today
[1:11:33] never mom never was there an
[1:11:40] option amen and God granted him the word
[1:11:42] of God that you've been that you're
[1:11:43] living on now the foundation that you
[1:11:45] have now that's why he gave it to God
[1:11:49] and let God take over and let God do
[1:11:52] what he said he would do amen
[1:11:55] let's trust God don't trust a man don't
[1:11:58] put your trust in no man fail you every
[1:12:00] time put your trust in
[1:12:02] God so brother randman has got two parts
[1:12:05] his first part is he's the healing
[1:12:07] campaign remember the first pull we'll
[1:12:08] get into that later on but that is the
[1:12:10] healing campaign now listen healing
[1:12:13] campaign is fine we all need some kind
[1:12:15] of healing
[1:12:16] today but that healer is still here sir
[1:12:20] you don't need a prophet to come back
[1:12:21] and lay hands on the Bible says lay
[1:12:24] hands on the SI
[1:12:25] and they shall
[1:12:28] recover but brother random didn't come
[1:12:30] just to bring us back to the faith of
[1:12:33] the fathers cuz they're all
[1:12:39] dead everybody's dead till
[1:12:42] today but there had to be a message to
[1:12:45] be a resurrection
[1:12:49] message not a restoration message we all
[1:12:52] got to come to be
[1:12:54] restored amen all of us that are born
[1:12:56] again today you are restored back to the
[1:12:58] faith of the fathers but now you still
[1:13:01] got to go up at statute of perfect man
[1:13:02] cuz that is the faith of the fathers you
[1:13:05] can't say well I just believe brother R
[1:13:06] was a
[1:13:07] prophet can't happen cannot happen we
[1:13:11] are required and if we're required if it
[1:13:13] is required
[1:13:14] curriculum come on we have got a way to
[1:13:18] get there yes sir God can't say do this
[1:13:21] and but no you can't make it over there
[1:13:23] I want you to do this I require that you
[1:13:25] do this but it'll be too tough you just
[1:13:27] don't worry about it no God's got a
[1:13:29] group of people that says I want that
[1:13:31] out of me that's keeping me from getting
[1:13:34] out that's what I want I see the things
[1:13:37] I need to get
[1:13:39] out thank do
[1:13:43] you so number two he will reveal the
[1:13:46] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:13:47] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:13:50] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[1:13:52] these deviling now listen it was
[1:13:55] divinely revealed to the prophet during
[1:13:57] his first part of the of the of the age
[1:14:00] he was in that was
[1:14:03] the excuse me the Discerning of the
[1:14:05] thoughts intents of the heart but now
[1:14:08] he's going
[1:14:09] deeper he's going deeper into the word
[1:14:12] of God he's not bringing the threes now
[1:14:14] he's bringing the fours right amen you
[1:14:17] and I are living in a required
[1:14:20] four right you say oh that's a bad
[1:14:22] number not when it comes to Redemption
[1:14:25] right not when it comes to Redemption
[1:14:27] you'll never get fully redeemed without
[1:14:29] a four right but it is a number of man

[1:15:03] prophet it was good that we know we got
[1:15:05] to be justified it's good that we know
[1:15:07] we got to be Sanctified am I making any
[1:15:09] sense today we have come through that
[1:15:11] part of receiving the baptism of the
[1:15:13] Holy Ghost the seed come alive in our
[1:15:16] heart the word of God is precious to us

[1:15:29] people listen we got the president to do
[1:15:31] it now I'm just going to say
[1:15:35] that a woman couldn't do it

[1:15:41] ecclesiastical power he says he's a
[1:15:43] Christian right and he's got definitely
[1:15:45] got the economic power so here we are

[1:16:47] here true and we are Revelation people
[1:16:52] brother BR said we love revelation and
[1:16:55] Satan hates it that's right so guess

[1:17:00] that's one against the old
[1:17:02] boy devil you can't get me now this is
[1:17:05] where it's at many of you we baptized 30

[1:17:38] here to change you can't do it you got
[1:17:40] to change yourself let God change you
[1:17:43] amen that's right choice the Revelation
[1:17:46] contained in the Seven Seals now watch
[1:17:47] it will be these divinely revealed so
[1:17:49] it's not going to be revealed brother
[1:17:51] brother Herman it's not going to be
[1:17:52] revealed to just a whole group of people
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:55] right that's right come
[1:17:57] on brother R said out of the true church
[1:18:02] yes will come a
[1:18:05] church out of the two seeds in the
[1:18:07] framework of the message Church they'll
[1:18:10] come
[1:18:11] one it's honing time and brother R said
[1:18:15] it's time that that Pyramid has got he
[1:18:17] can't set that on this right he's got to
[1:18:22] set that right where it's at righten
[1:18:26] amen and it'll take divinely revealed
[1:18:29] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:18:32] hearts of the children of the
[1:18:33] Pentecostal fathers listen we're here
[1:18:35] like I said before we are not a prophecy
[1:18:39] we're a
[1:18:40] reality we're living it right
[1:18:46] now we know what he'll be it be in the
[1:18:50] nature of Elijah we know
[1:18:53] that but the Lord yourself shall descend
[1:18:55] from heaven with a shout the voice of
[1:18:57] the Archangel and the Trump of God and
[1:18:59] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[1:19:02] we which your alive and remain shall be
[1:19:04] caught up together that's why I said
[1:19:05] before we are not looking
[1:19:08] for a
[1:19:10] Rapture oh boy now some of y'all the
[1:19:12] older ones you going to go wait a
[1:19:15] minute this church is not looking for a
[1:19:18] Rapture that's right we've been taught
[1:19:21] not to look for a Rapture that's right
[1:19:23] amen what Brother D say the Rapture
[1:19:26] was it's in you but what did he say it
[1:19:28] was it was a culmination of what
[1:19:31] happened
[1:19:32] before cuz Rapture is ecstasy Rapture is
[1:19:35] not in the
[1:19:36] Bible right Rapture is an ecstasy
[1:19:39] Rapture is what it's you being you can
[1:19:42] have a Rapture right here that's right

[1:19:48] resurrection message that's why we can't
[1:19:50] go around the son of man Ministry we
[1:19:53] can't go around be incarnate in a bride

[1:20:23] Archangel brother

[1:20:52] fulfilled that scripture we have heard

[1:22:09] prophecies that it can listen brother
[1:22:12] brandham prophesied about me and
[1:22:15] you but as I read to you last
[1:22:19] Sunday I hope you believe that it wasn't
[1:22:23] for them people
[1:22:25] he said it wasn't for them go to
[1:22:27] questions and answers on the seals read
[1:22:29] the first five paragraphs he said it's
[1:22:31] not for you gone from you you're not
[1:22:34] even supposed to get
[1:22:35] it now he's not talking to this group
[1:22:37] here I'm not talking to y'all Y y'all
[1:22:39] ain't getting it now there's another
[1:22:40] this is
[1:22:41] it this is the come out we got to come
[1:22:44] out and
[1:22:45] in
[1:22:50] am all these prophecies that it could
[1:22:53] perfectly set in order for this day in
[1:22:56] the scriptures we see it living right
[1:23:00] there what is it living in a
[1:23:03] tree living in a
[1:23:05] car living in a boat living in
[1:23:09] people people
[1:23:12] amen now continue on the Rapture message
[1:23:15] the second is a voice of the
[1:23:17] Resurrection now you got to come through
[1:23:19] the shout you got to hear it and you got
[1:23:20] to become the shout come that's right
[1:23:24] did Joshua shout when the walls of
[1:23:27] Jericho come
[1:23:30] down don't be afraid to answer that he
[1:23:33] did not that's right he told him what to
[1:23:36] do he said when you shout the walls will
[1:23:40] fall that's right amen the second is a
[1:23:43] voice of the Resurrection the same voice
[1:23:45] the same voice a loud voice in St John
[1:23:49] that called Lazarus from the grave and
[1:23:51] who was that that was the son of man
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] that was incarnate God that could raise
[1:23:58] somebody up just for by speaking their
[1:24:01] name brother Brown said you know what if
[1:24:04] he had to called lazarus's name he said
[1:24:05] all of them would have come out right
[1:24:08] right all of them would have come out
[1:24:10] but Lazarus come
[1:24:14] forth am do you really believe that
[1:24:18] amen we're not going to go to a gravide
[1:24:21] and just and all of us kind of huddle
[1:24:23] around and start
[1:24:26] screaming it'll be the quietest thing
[1:24:28] ever happened on the face of the Earth
[1:24:30] cuz it's a
[1:24:31] secret them brothers and sisters are not
[1:24:34] going to have to dig their way out of a
[1:24:36] grave you'll never see it there'll still
[1:24:39] be tombstones out there says Samuel
[1:24:43] D B dig way
[1:24:46] out we're digging him out now that's
[1:24:51] right we EXA are the final voice
[1:24:54] to the final
[1:24:56] age they without us cannot be made
[1:24:59] perfect that's scripture how we go are
[1:25:01] we going to really really realize that
[1:25:04] because he sent us a message that we can
[1:25:07] do
[1:25:07] that but we got to come out of all
[1:25:11] that got you thinking
[1:25:14] thinking what's killing us our thoughts
[1:25:17] our thought well you're
[1:25:20] dead right Jesus never one time said I
[1:25:25] thought he said I say unto
[1:25:28] you verely verely I say unto you listen
[1:25:32] listen but did they listen to him no did
[1:25:36] they listen to brother randam no more
[1:25:37] denominations now than ever was brother
[1:25:39] RAM on that side believe an invisible
[1:25:41] union he said I come to shreport he said
[1:25:44] I preach about long short hair he said
[1:25:46] you just keep bobbing your hair off
[1:25:47] until you get it in your soul you're not
[1:25:50] going to you may
[1:25:52] play you may the
[1:25:56] pig put lipstick on it but you turn that
[1:26:00] baby loose going back to the
[1:26:03] mud that's why I'm telling you we got to
[1:26:05] get in the word and know we're in the
[1:26:06] word or we are going to go back to what
[1:26:09] we were doing
[1:26:14] before now the third thing is a trumpet
[1:26:17] which always at the Feast of trumpets is
[1:26:20] calling the people to the feast and
[1:26:21] that'll be the bride supper the lamb
[1:26:23] supper with the bride
[1:26:24] in the sky so the dead in Christ shall
[1:26:27] rise
[1:26:28] what all right so what are we looking
[1:26:30] for we're looking for a resurrection
[1:26:32] first and then we which are alive and
[1:26:34] remain will be
[1:26:36] changed come on this is
[1:26:39] Bible absolutely huh right and then
[1:26:43] we'll go in the air to meet the Lord
[1:26:45] number three which is the
[1:26:51] rapture I hope we get that I'm not
[1:26:54] saying don't say we're not we're looking
[1:26:56] we hope the Rapture comes but you got to
[1:26:59] have a resurrection first yes sir amen
[1:27:02] you got to have us having our body
[1:27:03] changed first or second actually that's
[1:27:07] going to be the Paradox we're going to
[1:27:09] be standing here and Donnie's going to
[1:27:10] be 70 something years
[1:27:12] old than you're
[1:27:19] welcome and his voice is going to ring
[1:27:22] out
[1:27:24] and them dead
[1:27:25] Saints are coming
[1:27:28] here this is not fairy
[1:27:30] tale this is the truth someone will have
[1:27:33] the voice of the Resurrection in their
[1:27:37] voice in their voice amen and they say
[1:27:40] come out of the grave and still be 70
[1:27:43] something years old probably still
[1:27:45] hurting from arthritis and and wobble up
[1:27:47] to the to the great see because this is
[1:27:49] a secret God hid this thing he's hid it
[1:27:52] from everybody but the real true bride
[1:27:55] only the bride will know who she
[1:28:01] is that's a paradox that God's going to
[1:28:05] allow the resurrection to be in our
[1:28:08] voice to change the bodies of those dead
[1:28:11] Saints and us standing here and still be
[1:28:13] the age that we are but it will happen I
[1:28:15] promise you it's going to happen it's
[1:28:17] thus sayth the Lord it'll happen amen
[1:28:20] cuz then we see them and then we get
[1:28:23] enough faith maybe for our own bodies to
[1:28:26] change cuz that's what the Bible
[1:28:28] says we which are alive and remain shall
[1:28:31] not prevent or hinder those which are
[1:28:32] asleep for the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:28:34] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:28:36] shall be what changed and caught up to
[1:28:39] meet the Lord in the air let's look for
[1:28:40] a resurrection message let the
[1:28:43] Resurrection start in you let the
[1:28:45] resurrection today this Thanksgiving
[1:28:47] coming up week let that start in you be
[1:28:50] thankful that God give you this there's
[1:28:51] billions of people in the world that
[1:28:53] will never hear this
[1:28:56] that's
[1:28:57] right number one it makes you happy and
[1:28:59] number one it makes you
[1:29:01] sad both number ones cuz you're sad and
[1:29:04] happy at the same
[1:29:06] time you sit and watch you go to an
[1:29:08] airport and there's well in Atlanta
[1:29:11] there's thousands of people walk by
[1:29:14] that'll never know what you
[1:29:17] know that's the truth never know that's
[1:29:21] right and remember I asked the Lord one
[1:29:23] time I said Lord why why me sitting here
[1:29:26] by myself getting ready to go preach for
[1:29:28] somebody I think I was going to Oklahoma
[1:29:29] actually preach for brother Claude and
[1:29:32] why
[1:29:34] me he said you know what he said you
[1:29:37] answered the call right that's right
[1:29:40] that's so simple I didn't dress right
[1:29:43] didn't act right you answered the call
[1:29:45] that's right absolutely right you
[1:29:47] answered the call Cuz listen you believe

[1:33:08] resonating in our heart to get us out of
[1:33:12] here yes amen that's what I'm proud to
[1:33:14] tell you that's my Thanksgiving
[1:33:18] message is we have an
[1:33:20] opportunity oh my listen the pilgrims
[1:33:24] they sailed to a new land that some of
[1:33:27] them probably had never been
[1:33:29] before but they wanted to get out of
[1:33:32] what they were in which was
[1:33:34] what what religious
[1:33:38] persecution they wanted to get out so
[1:33:41] they went to America a new land that
[1:33:43] maybe there was a little bit of
[1:33:44] apprehension they met the Indians
[1:33:47] first right but now you look at this
[1:33:50] land now how populated it is all from
[1:33:52] that one plump coming to Plymouth Rock
[1:33:55] somewhere you had a Plymouth
[1:33:57] Rock somewhere your boat landed on
[1:34:02] rock and what have you done with it it's
[1:34:04] your business brother Brown said look no
[1:34:07] other time could this message ever come
[1:34:09] forth till now Jesus said as it was in
[1:34:12] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:34:14] coming of the son of man the message
[1:34:16] could not be till now right but now
[1:34:20] remember he was prophesying it's not for
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:25] right you want me to read that quote
[1:34:27] again I got it to the very end if you
[1:34:29] don't believe me go to questions and
[1:34:30] answers on the seals read the first five
[1:34:32] paragraphs he said you're not getting it
[1:34:34] it's not for
[1:34:36] you right he said go and live a simple
[1:34:40] Christian Life these things will be made
[1:34:42] known what it's be made known
[1:34:44] now no other time could this message
[1:34:46] ever come forth till now Jesus said as
[1:34:49] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:34:51] in the coming of the son of man boy
[1:34:53] don't we know we live in a sodomite
[1:34:55] condition the message could not be till
[1:34:57] now the world wasn't in the condition
[1:35:01] that's
[1:35:02] right as until it's in right
[1:35:07] now this is the hour that Jesus could
[1:35:10] appear at any
[1:35:12] time do we believe
[1:35:15] that foreal now
[1:35:19] watch notice fully Satan on his throne
[1:35:23] yes sir
[1:35:24] offered it to God offered it to our Lord
[1:35:26] here he is sitting here with this
[1:35:27] beastly heart in him now here's the
[1:35:30] person the Beast the Incarnate devil all
[1:35:34] right he makes his appearing here on
[1:35:37] Earth under the false pretense oh my
[1:35:39] goodness under the false pretense of the
[1:35:42] true word I have that underlined for a
[1:35:44] reason he Associates himself with the
[1:35:48] word am that's right he's sitting here
[1:35:51] today listening to what we're talking
[1:35:53] talking about but praise God he can't
[1:35:56] get a revelation like we can get he
[1:35:58] can't get a heart change like we
[1:36:00] get I ought to make you real
[1:36:03] happy he did just the same thing his
[1:36:06] type did which was Judas 2,000 years ago
[1:36:08] what did he do Judas came in as a
[1:36:12] Believer being a devil from the
[1:36:15] beginning he was born the son of
[1:36:17] predition he pulled nothing over on the
[1:36:21] son of man
[1:36:24] cuz he knowed him from the very
[1:36:25] beginning for he was the
[1:36:29] word you and I got to be the word
[1:36:32] nothing
[1:36:33] else the word made manifest and nothing
[1:36:36] else not just reading it kids being
[1:36:39] it right
[1:36:42] right so this Elijah just a few minutes
[1:36:45] is to restore all things but he's got to
[1:36:48] do it in four stages all right
[1:36:53] I want to tell you something real quick
[1:36:55] this is not we're going to get into this
[1:36:56] later
[1:36:57] on at the end of every seven years now
[1:37:00] this is Deuteronomy according to the law
[1:37:03] at the end of every seven years Thou
[1:37:05] shalt make a release all right real
[1:37:07] quick for those of you that's got your
[1:37:08] eyes closed pay attention
[1:37:11] um not you cuz you're sitting up here in
[1:37:13] the front all right listen real quick
[1:37:17] what happened in the Old Testament if
[1:37:18] you couldn't pay your
[1:37:19] debt all right if you owed somebody
[1:37:22] something you owed them some time you ow
[1:37:23] him some money blah blah blah whatever
[1:37:25] you could go to work for him for seven
[1:37:27] years remember what remember what Jacob
[1:37:29] did with Leah she he fulfilled her week
[1:37:32] he worked seven years to get Leah or to
[1:37:34] get Rachel and he got tricked and got
[1:37:36] Leah and had to work seven more years he
[1:37:38] must have really loved her brother Jim
[1:37:39] cuz he worked 14 years for one woman
[1:37:42] anyway praise the Lord but anyhow so
[1:37:46] every seven years though was not a
[1:37:50] jubilee brother
[1:37:52] collie that's right it wasn't a jubilee
[1:37:55] not everything went
[1:37:57] free only whatever you owed and some of
[1:38:00] your possessions but if there's all kind
[1:38:02] of stipulation if you married a woman
[1:38:05] and at seven years she couldn't go out
[1:38:06] if she was a Hebrew there was different
[1:38:08] stipulations and other words they
[1:38:10] couldn't get all the way out they had to
[1:38:12] leave some
[1:38:14] possession but every seven time
[1:38:19] s is a jubilee which is a 49 and then
[1:38:23] you got your 50th Jubilee which I've
[1:38:26] told you many times before I I we
[1:38:29] preached on it years and years ago it's
[1:38:31] in the Bible there was a 50th Jubilee
[1:38:33] but Israel has never ever celebrated a
[1:38:37] 50th Jubilee that's right go to your
[1:38:39] history even the history Guy the one
[1:38:41] online was T he said we've never had a
[1:38:45] 50th cuz
[1:38:47] 50 you know how Jews are with money they
[1:38:50] ain't going to let all their money go
[1:38:53] but in the in the in the pretense of
[1:38:55] what we're talking about every seven
[1:39:00] years there was a
[1:39:02] release then you counted seven of those
[1:39:05] seven years we'll get into all this
[1:39:08] later which is 49 7 * 7 is
[1:39:11] 49 you had to then that was a one more
[1:39:14] year there was a total release a golden
[1:39:18] jubilee that everything went out it
[1:39:20] didn't matter brother R said you could
[1:39:22] throw your ho down and take off but
[1:39:25] remember if you stayed there what' they
[1:39:30] do they messed with your
[1:39:33] hearing you couldn't hear no more they
[1:39:36] bored your ear with an awe and you
[1:39:38] listen you were slave till you
[1:39:41] died but you had an opportunity to get
[1:39:45] out right now listen brother right I'm
[1:39:47] talking here I had to say that for this
[1:39:49] if somehow or the other the individual
[1:39:51] lost their inheritance that was given to
[1:39:52] them by God there come a year called The
[1:39:54] Jubilee year every seven years they had
[1:39:56] a rest or a Sabbath Sabbath means rest a
[1:40:00] lot of times they'd let the land rest
[1:40:02] they'd rotate crops and every seven
[1:40:03] years they'd let that peach property
[1:40:05] rest it's all a type every seven days
[1:40:08] they had a Sabbath we know that every
[1:40:11] seven years they had a Sabbath and seven
[1:40:13] Sabbath was 49 years and the 50th was a
[1:40:17] jubilee so it wasn't if you kept having
[1:40:19] those seven-year Cycles nobody went free
[1:40:22] but just a few things a few
[1:40:24] items got it you had to hit that 50th to
[1:40:29] throw down the hole to take a body chain
[1:40:32] to get out of the position that you were
[1:40:33] in so listen am everybody with me amen
[1:40:38] Feast of the
[1:40:40] trumpets now here it is the great thing
[1:40:42] look the Holy Spirit has been bound by
[1:40:44] the denominations 2,000 years we find
[1:40:46] out it has now notice the sabbaths seven
[1:40:50] sabbaths are seven years are 70 weeks
[1:40:53] whatever you want to call it they
[1:40:55] couldn't get all the way out now he's
[1:40:56] talking
[1:40:58] about the church ages right how many
[1:41:01] Church ages are they seven right seven
[1:41:05] Church
[1:41:06] ages seven time seven it's 49 you go
[1:41:11] right back into that same cycle again
[1:41:13] and you don't get all the way out that's
[1:41:16] why you and I have got to come out we
[1:41:18] don't have to just come out of the world
[1:41:19] we got to come out of this age right we
[1:41:22] got to come out of the age of this to go
[1:41:24] free to be in the Jubilee year right
[1:41:28] amen there'll be a day that neither day
[1:41:30] or night restoration of the Bride tree
[1:41:32] so how's this going to
[1:41:35] happen and if four messengers of death
[1:41:37] killed the tree four messengers of Life
[1:41:40] restore the tree do you get it
[1:41:43] congregation says amen for God said I
[1:41:46] will restore it now what is what is
[1:41:49] Elijah's message it's a message of
[1:41:51] restoration hold on a minute now it's a
[1:41:54] message of restoration
[1:41:56] plus amen I just read it to you the
[1:41:58] first part of Malachi 4 was to restore
[1:42:00] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:42:01] fathers justification sanctification
[1:42:04] baptism the Holy Ghost but then to take
[1:42:06] those denominations that it said it was
[1:42:08] bound by in this quote here and to do
[1:42:11] away with them to give you a jubilee to
[1:42:13] get you out of the
[1:42:15] age right and the four messengers of
[1:42:18] death killed the tree four messengers of
[1:42:19] Life restored the tree do you get it
[1:42:22] he's going to restore it how by four
[1:42:25] death Messengers killed it then four
[1:42:27] life Messengers will restore it what was
[1:42:30] the first Martin Luther justification
[1:42:33] what was the second John Wesley
[1:42:34] sanctification what was the third
[1:42:36] Pentecost listen Pentecost wasn't false
[1:42:41] right brother R said the Holy Ghost came
[1:42:43] himself on the that on 1906 Street
[1:42:46] wasn't false that was the true Holy
[1:42:48] Ghost it had to come back restore the
[1:42:49] gifts now what they did with it was
[1:42:51] garbage but it was true at their time
[1:42:54] but you know what they they didn't move
[1:42:56] on so watch what was the third Pentecost
[1:43:00] with the restoration of the gifts the
[1:43:01] Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] what was the
[1:43:04] fourth the
[1:43:06] word the word there were four great
[1:43:09] prophets one of them Martin Luther began
[1:43:11] to shine a light little bit of light
[1:43:13] very small strength of justification
[1:43:15] Wesley stronger with
[1:43:17] sanctification after Wesley come the
[1:43:19] stronger than him Pentecostal the
[1:43:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost and another
[1:43:22] great Prophet we know who that was the
[1:43:25] Holy Ghost came himself wasn't brother
[1:43:26] random everybody with me you you just
[1:43:30] been here long enough you know that
[1:43:31] there was no Messenger to that
[1:43:34] age but in the last days of Malachi 4
[1:43:37] Elijah is to come with the very
[1:43:39] word the word of the Lord came to the
[1:43:42] prophets in the evening lights is to
[1:43:44] come forth to restore and bring back
[1:43:46] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:43:48] the faith of God fourth light four
[1:43:51] Killers took it four Messengers
[1:43:53] destroyed it for messengers of death
[1:43:55] took it away and Dogma for me messengers
[1:43:58] of righteousness restore her back again
[1:44:01] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[1:44:04] which we had time I got it wrote down
[1:44:05] here but I have to miss that prophecy
[1:44:07] can these bones
[1:44:11] live what's the four stages of that
[1:44:13] coming forth of that church church
[1:44:15] brother B says what's the four stages of
[1:44:17] ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the
[1:44:20] life only comes not when the skin was on
[1:44:22] it
[1:44:25] that was
[1:44:27] third but when the wind blowed upon them
[1:44:31] that's when come back that four message
[1:44:34] of life amen fourth message
[1:44:38] Masterpiece
[1:44:44] 1964 and the life that was in the stalk
[1:44:46] went one went to make the other
[1:44:48] justification made a way for
[1:44:50] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:44:52] for the baptism of of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[1:44:56] for the Holy Ghost
[1:45:03] itself that's not your new
[1:45:05] birth everybody with me I can't reach at
[1:45:09] them that right there that's not your
[1:45:12] new birth you got to be born again down
[1:45:14] here to even know what these are we know
[1:45:17] that we taught that that Brother D
[1:45:18] taught it for 50 years what is that
[1:45:21] right there though that's bringing back
[1:45:23] the power of the word not the word the
[1:45:25] power of the word and a group of
[1:45:30] people the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:32] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to
[1:45:35] come right down in
[1:45:37] Perfection right back to the word again
[1:45:40] to manifest
[1:45:42] itself third
[1:45:44] seal here he comes as the Antichrist
[1:45:47] false prophet then the Beast then in
[1:45:49] Dark Age and the church comes out of
[1:45:51] that Dark Age justification
[1:45:53] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[1:45:55] Incarnate
[1:45:56] Word the way
[1:45:59] now H Incarnate Word the way
[1:46:03] now do you believe
[1:46:06] that I hope you
[1:46:09] do he goes he comes down the church goes
[1:46:12] up the writer is the same one but
[1:46:15] another stage of his ministry the first
[1:46:16] stage was a white horse he was just a
[1:46:18] teacher just an antichrist teacher he
[1:46:21] was against the word of God and now how
[1:46:23] can you be an antichrist anybody that
[1:46:26] denies that every
[1:46:28] word everybody with me on this remember
[1:46:31] it be so
[1:46:32] close and what is so close God and Satan
[1:46:36] there's the only two Powers right
[1:46:38] anybody that denies that every word of
[1:46:41] this isn't true and to be taught just
[1:46:42] the same is an antichrist cuz they deny
[1:46:46] the the the word and he is the word se's
[1:46:50] not air with the shook she was not the
[1:46:53] seed Mary was not she was a Shu tassel
[1:46:56] stalk carriers of part of the word not
[1:46:59] all the word Luther had justification
[1:47:02] Wesley had sanctification Pentecostal
[1:47:03] has restoration gifts but when the word
[1:47:06] come you said brother wait the word been
[1:47:09] here for a long time it's got to be
[1:47:11] incarnate in
[1:47:12] somebody that you can stand and say I
[1:47:15] and my father are one yes sir a that
[1:47:18] what brother Bram said I give you a
[1:47:20] direct quote next Sunday whenever I
[1:47:22] preach again he
[1:47:26] said and these other things amen we
[1:47:31] those other things I want us to get to
[1:47:33] see something I think sometimes we sit
[1:47:36] we be in the message church we get
[1:47:38] lukewarm and it's really hot in here so
[1:47:42] we're not hot or cold I mean we're not
[1:47:43] lukewarm we're hot brother collie but
[1:47:46] we've come to a stage to where it's just
[1:47:48] become common everything's just become
[1:47:49] common we just whatever you know it's
[1:47:51] okay just brother Wade
[1:47:54] just brother Donnie Reagan just brother
[1:47:56] you put the moniker you put the name up
[1:47:58] it's just them people they have a big
[1:48:01] church up there we got a big church here
[1:48:02] we got a little church here they got
[1:48:04] this church over

[1:48:17] cycle to where you're letting a little
[1:48:19] bit of it out but you're not letting all

[1:49:20] Herman everybody love me just smile
[1:49:26] smile I was listening to third seal
[1:49:28] brother Brandon was he said something he
[1:49:31] said it many many times but he stopped
[1:49:32] and he said watch what you're thinking
[1:49:35] could you imagine while he was
[1:49:38] preaching he'd know what a brother or
[1:49:41] sister was thinking in their mind and
[1:49:44] God would project that to him and he
[1:49:46] would have have it in his mind while
[1:49:47] he's just hammering away just preaching
[1:49:49] away and he said I just caught your
[1:49:51] thought don't think that
[1:49:53] well you know what he done he heard what
[1:49:54] that person was thinking like what you
[1:49:56] got in your mind right now I don't want
[1:49:58] to
[1:50:00] know fried chicken and turkey and
[1:50:03] dressing but now
[1:50:07] watch that wasn't just a quote I gave
[1:50:09] you this is a brother brandom
[1:50:11] quote but when you come to
[1:50:15] say
[1:50:17] you not
[1:50:19] me not William
[1:50:21] brandom you
[1:50:24] when you say come to say I and my father
[1:50:27] are
[1:50:28] one and these other things then the Shu
[1:50:32] pulls away from
[1:50:34] it but the real genuine bride church
[1:50:38] will bring forth the
[1:50:40] entire word of God we still believe
[1:50:43] brother ran was a prophet right
[1:50:45] okay let me read that one more time but
[1:50:48] the real genuine bride church will bring
[1:50:51] forth the entire word of God in its
[1:50:54] fullness and in its strength for he's
[1:50:58] the same yesterday today and
[1:51:01] forever one more
[1:51:04] quote he's talking about carriers
[1:51:06] remember the listen the two shoots in
[1:51:08] Luther's time was was was the life of
[1:51:10] the message it was alive with the Holy
[1:51:13] Ghost
[1:51:15] amen but as you go on up the stock those
[1:51:18] leaves dry and fall off it becomes stock
[1:51:22] then it becomes
[1:51:23] tassel right
[1:51:26] shuck real corn this is what'll
[1:51:29] reproduce itself none of this other will
[1:51:33] reproduce itself a lot of y'all in here
[1:51:34] Farmers you know that's for sure you
[1:51:36] don't just run out there in a field of
[1:51:37] corn you got two shoot sticking up you
[1:51:39] start har you take your bag out there
[1:51:40] and start harvesting
[1:51:42] corn no you got to wait till it Murs and
[1:51:47] now let it dry in the
[1:51:50] sun presence of the Sun
[1:51:53] to
[1:51:55] ripen it certainly carried but the life
[1:51:59] left it as soon as it became a leaf it
[1:52:02] went on out to make something else until
[1:52:05] it come to its full
[1:52:09] stature and so will the church come
[1:52:12] through justification sanctification
[1:52:14] baptism of Holy Ghost restoration of the
[1:52:17] gifts right on into the formed image of
[1:52:20] Christ Christ is
[1:52:24] the
[1:52:24] bridegroom the church is the bride amen
[1:52:28] and the bride is part of the bridegroom
[1:52:30] it'll have to be a word church not a
[1:52:33] denominational Church it'll be the word
[1:52:36] church the word that's made known and by
[1:52:38] the Vindicated word of God now
[1:52:41] watch this is my question to
[1:52:44] you can you see the
[1:52:47] difference that don't make us no big big
[1:52:50] eyes and little yous but there's a
[1:52:51] difference in men ministry right there's
[1:52:54] a Pentecostal move in the message that
[1:52:56] they just dwell on that that's okay I
[1:52:59] that's okay for them but then there's
[1:53:00] one that says you're already you know
[1:53:02] we're waiting on brother randam you got
[1:53:04] all these different factions but that's
[1:53:06] not what this is talking about look
[1:53:09] balum he couldn't see the
[1:53:14] difference many
[1:53:17] can't Pharaoh couldn't see it though it
[1:53:21] Vindicated right before
[1:53:24] him
[1:53:26] daythan couldn't see it
[1:53:28] right can we see
[1:53:30] it can we come
[1:53:33] out last
[1:53:35] one musicians come on Jesus Christ is
[1:53:39] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:53:41] he's identifying himself as he promised
[1:53:44] much more could we say in these last
[1:53:47] days as son of man making himself known
[1:53:51] among his people look in the form of his
[1:53:57] people U that's
[1:54:00] y'all not Son of God not son of David
[1:54:04] but son of man the Son of God was
[1:54:09] Supernatural everybody with me on that
[1:54:11] that's what we had down through seven
[1:54:12] Church ages we had a supernatural god
[1:54:14] with a supernatural group of people but
[1:54:16] they couldn't get their they couldn't
[1:54:17] get all the denominational ideas out
[1:54:18] they couldn't get all the things out
[1:54:20] they couldn't get all the garbage out
[1:54:22] but now we have a garbage taker a
[1:54:24] garbage collector called the Holy Ghost
[1:54:27] incarnate in a group of people to get
[1:54:29] the garbage out the Son of God was the
[1:54:32] supernatural hallelujah what is the son
[1:54:34] of man it's the supernatural in human
[1:54:37] flesh not just in human flesh but doing
[1:54:39] the work of the son of
[1:54:41] man like Abraham he seen voices he heard
[1:54:44] things seen lights but just before the
[1:54:47] promised son come God revealed himself
[1:54:50] as a man in human flesh and read the
[1:54:53] thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in
[1:54:55] the room behind him now watch this is
[1:54:58] them everybody let's stand our feet as
[1:55:00] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:55:02] be in the coming of the Son of God
[1:55:04] coming when the son of man shall be
[1:55:06] being revealed the son of man being
[1:55:10] revealed not the Son of God in the
[1:55:13] church
[1:55:14] Age We Still Believe brother R was the
[1:55:16] prophet right not that cycle of sevens
[1:55:20] you can't have be that cycle of sevens
[1:55:22] you got to be called out of
[1:55:24] that the son of man being revealed not
[1:55:26] the Son of God in the church age he's
[1:55:28] put out of
[1:55:30] that now he's the son of man revealing
[1:55:33] himself the word is becoming flesh Among
[1:55:36] Us do you believe that
[1:55:39] amen can we stand it can we take it yes
[1:55:42] we're pressurized for it no one else was
[1:55:45] able to do it brother Joe nobody was
[1:55:46] pressurized except us we're in the
[1:55:49] astronaut age brother R told us that
[1:55:51] Time and Time and Time and Time and Time
[1:55:52] Again again we're in the astronaut age
[1:55:55] we going to have pressure you're not
[1:55:57] just an astronaut and and
[1:56:00] um atmospheric pressure goes away no
[1:56:03] there's just a way to get through it
[1:56:07] they built a ship to get through that
[1:56:09] atmospheric pressure so that it wouldn't
[1:56:11] kill a human being right is that what it
[1:56:13] was just pretty simple to tell you that
[1:56:15] if not then it just Crush everything
[1:56:18] like those people that got crushed the
[1:56:19] other day that went like so many miles
[1:56:20] down in the ocean that was one little
[1:56:24] fracture that you couldn't even see they
[1:56:27] said one fracture that's how sinle do
[1:56:31] one
[1:56:32] fracture one little sin but what
[1:56:35] happened was is one little crack it got
[1:56:38] so hard
[1:56:39] pressure they said it just within
[1:56:41] seconds I'm not going to tell you what
[1:56:43] they said happened to the bodies but it
[1:56:45] just literally crushed their bones right
[1:56:47] out of their
[1:56:49] body they weren't used to the pressure
[1:56:52] pressure if you're not used to the
[1:56:54] pressure you're not going to be here you
[1:56:57] got to be pressurized you got to be in
[1:56:59] the word of God you got to know your day
[1:57:02] and hour that you're living in there's
[1:57:04] nobody can do it but this message of the
[1:57:07] hour you can't do it with a
[1:57:08] denominational idea they got too many
[1:57:11] ideas same Bible 13,000 different ways
[1:57:14] of preaching it there's only one and
[1:57:17] yeah we got it yeah we got it but what
[1:57:20] we going to do with it but we going to
[1:57:22] let pass on by are we going to take it
