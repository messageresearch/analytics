[1:50] make try later I don't know I hadn't got

[1:55] exact details but he's not coming right
[2:00] now so remember that part amen
[2:02] any other announcements we've been made

[2:17] yeah
[2:18] Bible study this coming Saturday 6
[2:20] o'clock ok father we thank you for this
[2:23] day in your love father and thank you
[2:26] for your grace and understanding of each
[2:28] one of us thank you for you we just ask
[2:30] you that you would guide each one that
[2:33] you'd allow us to understand you Lord
[2:35] and to walk in your grace and forgive
[2:38] our sins and keep us Lord because that's
[2:40] the part that we need more than anything
[2:42] and just teach us that understanding
[2:45] because in that is where we Lord we're
[2:48] failing to walk in you as we see you
[2:51] unfold so just help us to settle
[2:55] ourselves down and get into that chance
[2:57] what we're supposed to as the Prophet
[2:59] said to where we can move on upward in
[3:01] you and just let your loving grace be
[3:04] with each one we love you and we thank
[3:06] you remember the sick ones among us just
[3:09] touch each one in Jesus name first Peter
[3:21] seeing you have purified your souls in
[3:24] obeying the truth through the spirit
[3:26] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[3:29] that you love one another with a pure
[3:31] heart fervently being born again not a
[3:34] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[3:38] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[3:41] for ever how is the new birth brings it
[3:46] to Pais the birth of the word then what
[3:49] would be anything from there would be
[3:51] the growth our understanding our
[3:53] development into the word so now we go
[3:56] to 2nd Peter Simon Peter servant an
[4:00] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[4:02] have obtained like precious faith with
[4:04] us through the righteousness of God and
[4:06] our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace
[4:09] be multiplied unto you through the
[4:11] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[4:14] according as his divine power hath given
[4:17] unto us all things that pertain unto
[4:20] life and godliness through the knowledge
[4:22] of him that have called us to glory in
[4:25] virtue
[4:25] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[4:27] great and precious promises that by
[4:31] these you might be partakers of the
[4:34] divine nature having escaped the
[4:36] corruption that is in the world through
[4:38] lust and beside this giving all
[4:40] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[4:42] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[4:43] temperance and to temperance patience
[4:46] and to patience godliness and to
[4:48] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[4:50] brotherly kindness charity you may be
[4:54] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[4:57] reading of the word in yeah I kind of
[5:02] want to you know I don't even in that
[5:05] one time and kind of injected a thought
[5:07] in to
[5:11] what we were talking about and that's
[5:13] kind of what I want to do tonight and
[5:15] kind of place it in the right order to
[5:20] where that we can follow the things
[5:22] because I enjoy seeing things from many
[5:27] different avenues in the Word of God I
[5:31] enjoy that I love to read and study it
[5:34] and that's what we've been doing see is
[5:36] taking like the statue of a perfect man
[5:38] going through that through the virtues
[5:41] and the things showing the growth
[5:42] development showing the the stages of
[5:45] our Christian journey and then we picked
[5:48] up adoption along the way and you know
[5:52] bringing that in to show that Peter and
[5:55] and Paul were both preaching the same
[5:58] thing that adoption is the same thing as
[6:01] the statute of a perfect man you know I
[6:04] remember a man one time say and he said
[6:06] always said that adoption is simple but
[6:09] said that statue of perfect man is deep
[6:11] well to me it's the same thing I mean
[6:14] it's a growth development of a Christian
[6:17] it's showing our journey in in through
[6:20] life and and do it and that's that's
[6:23] what I want to emphasize a little bit
[6:26] right here to start with no we're not
[6:31] trying to find something new or anything
[6:35] like that the Prophet didn't do those
[6:37] things but the channel and the way to
[6:40] come to the stature of a perfect man or
[6:46] adoption or anything like that
[6:48] it was lost down through the time now
[6:52] not lost to where that it went away that
[6:54] nobody didn't talk about it or or
[6:56] nothing like that it's it's kind of like
[7:00] the Prophet is we'll get to it in a
[7:02] minute where he says the the baptism in
[7:04] the Holy Ghost is so incorrectly taught
[7:07] well see then we must come back to his
[7:12] teachings of that and and and all of
[7:16] that way and that's way that I've always
[7:17] tried to bring it C is to bring what he
[7:21] had to say and bring to our under
[7:24] standing to you know follow the Word of
[7:28] God
[7:28] all right now it didn't when we talked
[7:32] about that the the kekkon worm worm
[7:36] locust caterpillar etc ate down the tree
[7:39] and the things like that the Prophet is
[7:41] not talking about that it ate the pages
[7:45] out of the Bible and we don't have that
[7:46] to where we can read or anything like
[7:49] that we still got the same from the time
[7:52] of bringing it we've got the same Bible
[7:55] you know in in our art laying out before
[7:58] us all right so it's not something to
[8:01] work that those things were eaten away
[8:03] that they could not be read but the
[8:06] understanding you know the the part of
[8:11] the word that we could follow it and
[8:14] have it revealed to us and know what
[8:17] it's saying all right see then when the
[8:20] Prophet came along to try to explain
[8:23] those things to us that's why it's made
[8:26] it so hard for us to follow you know our
[8:31] to to walk in in that word and follow it
[8:36] because it does sometimes sound a little
[8:39] contrary one to the other or our
[8:42] thoughts and ideas but remember now that
[8:45] we're studying the part of the Prophet
[8:48] coming to bring us the word that's the
[8:51] main point because that way where it's
[8:54] not what we think see we think it's this
[8:58] we think it's that it's been taught by
[9:00] mankind as we'll get to it in a minute
[9:03] that the Prophet says the baptism has
[9:05] been taught he said people teach it as
[9:08] water baptism meaning you're saved or
[9:11] they preach it as this is being saved or
[9:13] that is being said and he said those
[9:15] things are not right but that's been
[9:18] taught by mankind who you go across the
[9:20] land today to the church isn't a thing
[9:23] until you would find as I said there one
[9:26] time if we got you know I don't know how
[9:30] many thousand denominations they are now
[9:32] it used to be 969 well if you did you'd
[9:35] have 900 or 69 different verse
[9:38] you remember that back a few months ago
[9:41] trying to express something from it that
[9:43] we would have that many different
[9:45] versions of the new work well it can't
[9:49] be that confusing you know it can't be
[9:53] to that point you know somewhere there
[9:56] has to be truth and and we should have
[10:00] enough natural things you know to follow
[10:05] in the Word of God until we can actually
[10:07] see the spiritual from it
[10:09] now because of the opening of the word
[10:12] in the last days that's been brought to
[10:14] us all right so we're not trying to
[10:18] correct denominations and their
[10:20] teachings not trying to correct this
[10:23] that or the other
[10:24] it's us that needs the correction right
[10:29] it's us as what we call you know the
[10:32] endtime people we're the ones the
[10:33] Prophet brought the message to the
[10:35] message is not to do that you know it's
[10:37] not to the denominations it is if
[10:41] they'll accept it yes it is if they'd
[10:43] receive it but now they won't do it so
[10:46] it's not far that it's for the bride
[10:48] all right see then then you say well as
[10:51] far the bride and the church it is if
[10:53] they'll accept it but they're not going
[10:55] to accept it and you know that all right
[10:57] so it leaves it to word being to the
[10:59] bride within how many of the proud I've
[11:01] got some as I wrote down through here I
[11:04] wrote it like this what do you believe
[11:08] you know and I'll try to get some
[11:11] thoughts in there and just ask you what
[11:13] do you believe you say well I believe
[11:16] this I believe that well is that what
[11:18] the Prophet believed now if it's not
[11:23] we're not following the Prophet well
[11:26] well who can say who's what well we've
[11:29] got the books and the tapes at least we
[11:31] can we can stay somewhere in the
[11:33] ballpark you know the old saying goes
[11:35] would at least to have a few things and
[11:38] like I've always said you say after 50
[11:41] years no what ideas all y'all to just a
[11:43] bunch of smart alecks well you ought to
[11:44] be pretty smart after for 50 years
[11:46] studying one message right I mean
[11:51] not studying all the denomination's and
[11:53] their ways and their ideas and if you're
[11:55] trying to do that that's that's not the
[11:57] Word of God it's to study the message we
[12:02] should have no problems with our
[12:04] understanding and it ought to be to the
[12:07] basis of laying down our thoughts and
[12:11] taking what he say it right but our
[12:15] problem is we want a little bit about
[12:17] what our thoughts and a little bit about
[12:19] his thoughts and a little bit about this
[12:21] a little bit about it and it gets all
[12:23] confusing because that would be where it
[12:28] would wind up all right
[12:29] we made as I said a little in road with
[12:33] the adoption Oh series into what we were
[12:36] talking about to give you two avenues of
[12:40] looking at the Bible as to what it's
[12:44] trying to bring the one Avenue would be
[12:47] from Peter see in first Peter that I
[12:50] keep reading that being born again you
[12:54] know showing that you need a new birth
[12:56] and then showing that you need a growth
[12:58] development are going to have it cause
[13:00] you're being born again then we go over
[13:03] to second Peter and we pick up how that
[13:06] is done by add to your faith virtue or
[13:09] knowledge temperance patience God
[13:11] all right see then we're following that
[13:13] through what we see in the world okay
[13:17] then we took the the point of adoption
[13:21] to understand adoption in the basis that
[13:24] you know in the natural adoptions of the
[13:28] land and the different things you got
[13:30] all kind of situations but Paul in
[13:33] Romans defines adoption Romans 8 and he
[13:39] brings us to the new birth his weight
[13:41] was bringing out the other day see he
[13:43] brought he Paul brings it to the new
[13:46] birth showing us that you know that
[13:50] we're adopted by the new birth see you
[13:54] and I were totally out of it we're not
[13:56] something in lineages all right now if
[13:59] you're going to go with adoption so you
[14:01] can only go to the Jews now you
[14:04] understand that
[14:05] I mean everybody our Eunice I see do I
[14:08] need to get the scripture the adoption
[14:10] pertaining to Israel
[14:12] Paul says why because they were to be
[14:16] the chosen people it had nothing to do
[14:19] for us because we were Gentiles all
[14:22] right so then that you could take the
[14:25] natural studying of the adoption and see
[14:29] how that they the baby was adopted you
[14:32] know when it was born into the family
[14:34] become a part of the family then it
[14:36] would growth development and up to the
[14:39] growth development to come out to to
[14:41] where it would have the the things of
[14:44] God are the things of the man and be
[14:46] adopted into the natural family all
[14:48] right and see but but that's Gentiles we
[14:52] had no connection so don't even try to
[14:56] put us with the Jews in adoptions means
[14:59] I bring it to what Paul is bringing it
[15:03] in Romans 8 where he's talking about you
[15:06] know the adoption all right and then
[15:10] we're by we cry by father okay then it
[15:13] comes on down to the second stage of
[15:15] adoption to the manifestation of the
[15:18] sons and daughters of God all right then
[15:21] it comes down to the life stage of
[15:23] adoption to wit to understand the
[15:27] redemption of the body
[15:29] all right so Peters saying the same as
[15:32] Paul and Paul is saying assignment Peter
[15:34] now in a few minutes we're going to pick
[15:36] up because I like it what it a
[15:39] Deuteronomy 17 16 worth it
[15:43] there's about three scriptures are that
[15:45] tells you you know that in the mouth of
[15:47] two or three witnesses that everything
[15:50] be established see you in the Old
[15:52] Testament times of doing the you know if
[15:56] he was up to a murder case that's where
[15:58] actually says in Deuteronomy if you were
[16:00] had something like trying somebody for
[16:02] murder
[16:02] it can't be by one witness it's got to
[16:05] be two or three witnesses see one
[16:09] witnesses this you say in the same
[16:10] things the other person saying you know
[16:12] arguing with each other all right let's
[16:14] see in the mouth of two or three
[16:16] witnesses let everything be established
[16:18] well right we use the dot
[16:19] should we use the statue of a perfect
[16:21] man now we want to review just a little
[16:24] bit and then we want to pick up a third
[16:26] stage in the Bible of showing us the
[16:30] things that we need to know and what is
[16:33] the things we need to know see sure we
[16:37] need to know that we need to be born
[16:39] again we need to know that all right but
[16:43] we need to know adoption we need to know
[16:46] that we studied it all right then we
[16:49] need to know for sure 'ti how all of
[16:52] that will climax in the family of God
[16:55] that are brought into the position to
[16:58] where they're supposed to be you know
[17:00] all of us together in Christ all right
[17:03] and see then it would come out to show
[17:06] us who we are and what's taking place
[17:10] because that's the main thing the main
[17:13] thing is wonder what the prophets say
[17:15] when the bride realizes who she is and
[17:19] what she's here for
[17:21] he said she'll be an invincible army
[17:24] right when she realizes that all right
[17:28] that's all I'm trying to do is get you
[17:30] and I to realize who we are and what's
[17:32] taking place all right see then taking
[17:34] things and showing it from the Bible
[17:37] that if we can show something in the
[17:39] mouth of two or three witnesses we ought
[17:41] to at least try to listen to that point
[17:44] to see that that's what God has tried to
[17:47] bring to all of us but now listen but
[17:51] Randall says on the blasphemous names
[17:53] they can pull that up if you want to but
[17:56] he says the Holy Spirit is not correctly
[17:58] taught no and he calls it holy spirit
[18:03] and the baptism he's tall but he said
[18:07] it's not correctly taught well no what
[18:11] is he meaning it's not correctly taught
[18:16] it's not truth it's partial truth it's
[18:20] our own thoughts and ideas coming in to
[18:24] that to try to tell what we believe well
[18:30] see it's not correctly taught see now he
[18:32] says that's
[18:33] so much confusion today about the Holy
[18:35] Spirit it's not correctly told I believe
[18:39] the baptism is taught this is just like
[18:41] an automobile you know you got so many
[18:43] parts sometimes all right and see each
[18:46] church has its own basis of the doctrine
[18:51] of the new birth
[18:53] all right now come into the message
[18:55] people what is it if you believe what I
[18:58] preach then they put the new birth on
[19:02] the basis of who who's who what camp are
[19:06] we in or what's going on you know
[19:09] brother so-and-so says it's this away
[19:11] cuz because he hunted and fished with
[19:13] the Prophet will amen amen for that I
[19:17] mean I would have loved to been able to
[19:19] done that but I wasn't able to but
[19:23] there's one thing about it I have the
[19:25] message that I can study and we asked
[19:28] brother Branham um we've done that over
[19:30] and over said brother Branham what is
[19:31] what is the new birth brother branham
[19:34] Christ the mystery of God revealed when
[19:36] he said he says the revelation of Jesus
[19:38] Christ personally to you the revelation
[19:44] of Jesus Christ personally to you it's
[19:48] not to me to you it's not this that it's
[19:50] not from brother Branham to me and you
[19:52] now that gets chilly see because you say
[19:55] you're going wrong no it's not that away
[19:58] but a random could tell you what he
[20:00] believed the new birth was I draw the
[20:03] house that in anybody else now I'd
[20:06] rather have that than having my own
[20:07] because I had to get rid of mine to
[20:10] accept what he said
[20:11] now there's four the troubles that we
[20:13] haven't gotten rid of our thoughts we've
[20:16] gotten rid of it enough until we kind of
[20:19] hang with the message and say yeah but
[20:22] then when he said something we just go
[20:25] ballistic
[20:26] with his thinking and ending on we can't
[20:29] keep it straight but he said they're so
[20:34] missed out all right
[20:37] see then the truth is there he talked
[20:40] the truth but how do you think the
[20:42] people felt in the day that he was
[20:45] teaching it about one will
[20:47] in a minute where he talking about now
[20:48] we've we've went along with each other
[20:51] so far and he's preaching at the Branham
[20:54] tabernacle he said we went along so far
[20:59] but he said now I don't know from your
[21:02] own telling his own church
[21:10] what about it telling his own church and
[21:14] he said we have this we have it he said
[21:16] branham's Tabernacle this is what we
[21:18] need
[21:22] well he wasn't out bragging rest of
[21:25] them's wrong well you know all that out
[21:26] that Rumble we're right
[21:28] no he held it pretty straight didn't he
[21:32] but now listen he said that's the Holy
[21:38] Spirit had been so incorrectly taught
[21:41] all right now then what would be the you
[21:49] know how are we going to determine the
[21:52] truth well we just take what the
[21:56] prophets said well you know that's kind
[21:59] of in a day now when there's a whole lot
[22:03] of things falling apart that says this
[22:06] is what the prophets said and everything
[22:08] else right so then maybe we need to
[22:14] listen and think about and consider
[22:17] ourselves what do you think about the
[22:23] Word of God can it be so confusing what
[22:30] what has caused it to be that the
[22:34] Prophet would have to say that the
[22:36] baptism of the Holy Spirit has been
[22:39] incorrectly taught you know what
[22:42] happened it's been incorrectly told you
[22:45] know that enough you know I mean you say
[22:48] that's stupid brother Dale and we all
[22:49] know well that's gets the point across
[22:52] if he said it's been incorrectly taught
[22:55] it's been incorrectly tall
[22:59] now that that sensible doesn't need a
[23:01] revelation all right let's see we've
[23:04] been through some things that we covered
[23:06] through the message and he says it's not
[23:15] correctly taught I believe that the
[23:18] baptism is taught me and when you talk
[23:24] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[23:26] there's a lot goes with it all right now
[23:30] where are you going to find in the
[23:36] religious world a true understanding of
[23:40] the new birth there can only be one
[23:47] place and that's in this message right
[23:49] is that they're all right it's in this
[23:52] message so it's the message part that
[23:54] we're concerned about we're not
[23:55] concerned about everything else all
[23:57] right but what about when a prophet
[23:59] would make statements me and say things
[24:05] like this one we went through this we'll
[24:07] go ahead - number two - our brothers
[24:11] we're brother I'm talking about you must
[24:13] be born again
[24:15] now let's see if it has been so
[24:17] incorrectly talk what do you think about
[24:22] this statement I suppose maybe there's
[24:25] just a little different he's talking
[24:27] about it okay and I'm saying this I know
[24:30] it's going on tape and I want to say
[24:32] this to the pastor's that will perhaps
[24:35] receive this tape I suppose maybe just a
[24:38] little different from what the regular
[24:39] Church teaches it now what does he teach
[24:44] that the regular Church don't teach
[24:47] first off he teaches the truth that's
[24:52] all right but look look what he says I
[24:57] teach and believe and believe cancel
[25:02] approve by the scripture that you're
[25:05] born of the Spirit and then baptized
[25:09] into the body by the Holy Spirit
[25:14] now do you believe that I'm as seriously
[25:21] asking you do you believe that that's
[25:24] what he said he believed when I
[25:27] anywheres else unless we get a personal
[25:33] Newton over what we'd say a point about
[25:36] him saying it you know unless we find
[25:40] something where he corrects things we're
[25:43] supposed to believe what he tells us now
[25:46] if he corrects it
[25:48] alright that's easy well I got a quote
[25:52] were okay let's hold on let's see if the
[25:54] quotes work let's see if it'll stay look
[25:58] and he's going to explain now why people
[26:02] have so many different thoughts and
[26:05] ideas about the new bird look at it and
[26:08] many of them teach he's telling you what
[26:11] he believed you're born of the Spirit
[26:14] and then baptized into the body by the
[26:17] Holy Spirit and many of them teach that
[26:21] just to come up and recognize recognize
[26:24] before the congregation and so forth as
[26:27] a sinner that you want to accept Christ
[26:29] as personal Savior that that is the new
[26:32] birth that's what many believe many
[26:35] believe that water baptism is the new
[26:37] birth and some of them believe that that
[26:40] you're born to the water when you're
[26:42] baptized into the water and there are so
[26:44] many different versions of it lots of
[26:47] them many believe that to receive a
[26:49] recited Creed and believe on a doctrine
[26:54] of a church just accept say I believe in
[26:58] the Holy Church that's what man teaches
[27:05] of the new birth and like I said then
[27:10] you take if there is a thousand
[27:12] different denominations you've got a
[27:14] thousand different ways of seeing the
[27:16] new birth there's just a few different
[27:19] versions that he defines as to doing all
[27:23] right but he said I believe
[27:26] can prove that you're born again and
[27:30] then baptized into the body well do you
[27:37] believe that you know can you put your
[27:42] whole heart on that can you get up in
[27:45] front of somebody and say this is what I
[27:47] believe how about it would we be willing
[27:57] to do that go ahead at number three more
[28:06] people so tossed about I believe that
[28:12] you believe in to everlasting life
[28:14] I believe that that your acceptance of
[28:18] the Lord Jesus gives you everlasting
[28:21] eternal life when you believe it
[28:25] then I believe by one spirit then we're
[28:31] baptized in by one spirit you're
[28:33] baptized into the body of believers now
[28:37] do you believe that well see you can
[28:41] take that and make him say just about
[28:43] anything you want to but go ahead and
[28:49] think about it now now look he said Paul
[28:55] said passing through the upper coast of
[28:58] Ephesus finding certain disciples he
[29:01] said have you received the Holy Ghost
[29:02] Holy Spirit since you believe now do you
[29:13] get eternal life when you believe
[29:21] the people that the Paul talked to they
[29:25] were believing unto that did not possess
[29:29] eternal life right but they were
[29:35] believing on two did to have it right
[29:42] did they have eternal life in their soul
[29:47] wait ice is gonna go ahead but number
[29:52] four questions and answers on Hebrews
[30:00] but now as far as having eternal life
[30:03] and being a Christian you are a
[30:07] Christian the moment you believe well
[30:13] there's that Baptist I believe is that
[30:17] what you believe I believe what he says
[30:21] because listen to what he says
[30:23] and that's not make-believe so no matter
[30:30] what you're reading on this other one
[30:32] back up here where you say well you know
[30:35] you believe in to eat everlasting life
[30:38] see then it's not just a mental
[30:42] believing it's got to be something
[30:46] different why because now he's
[30:48] explaining that that's not make-believe
[30:51] that's truly believe on the Lord Jesus
[30:54] and accept him as your personal Savior
[30:56] you're born again right there and how we
[30:58] turn a lot God comes into you now we
[31:07] have the answer
[31:10] believing on two is a wonderful thing if
[31:15] you keep on believing it'll turn out to
[31:17] be what you're supposed to be wanting it
[31:20] to be so then what he's saying when he
[31:25] says that I can prove that your borned
[31:32] of the Spirit and then baptized into the
[31:36] body now I'm asking you the question
[31:47] which one is the new birth when you're
[31:54] born to the spirit is that the new birth
[32:00] well then what is that being then
[32:03] baptized into the body by the Holy
[32:06] Spirit I've been through this over and
[32:18] over and over it for months and months
[32:23] trying to express it to you do we really
[32:27] believe the Prophet are we willing to
[32:34] lay down all of our thoughts and accept
[32:36] what he says well that sounds like the
[32:40] taste that you've got two different
[32:42] things dire but you see that's where we
[32:47] don't follow the Prophet go back to
[32:50] blasphemous names where we're given at a
[32:52] moment ago and look what he says he says
[32:55] you're birthed into this into this into
[32:57] this into this into this birthed into it
[33:01] how many new births do you have you only
[33:08] have one new birth but there's many as
[33:12] of trying to bring out the other day you
[33:15] have one filling of the Holy Spirit but
[33:17] there's many feelings of the Holy Spirit
[33:21] see so mankind had lost the channel were
[33:27] by the truth of understanding what the
[33:30] new birth is and how that it can be that
[33:34] you can receive eternal life by
[33:37] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ truly
[33:40] believing now not making believe in
[33:41] there have that you know haphazardly but
[33:44] you're believing unto eternal
[33:47] and that puts you into the body of
[33:49] Christ but then the stature of a perfect
[33:53] man baptizes you into the body for gifts
[33:58] and finally right see then how many new
[34:05] births do we have each one of these the
[34:08] Prophet says you're birthed into this
[34:10] you birthed into this birthed into this
[34:12] merchants of this birth is it what does
[34:14] he mean a birth means are coming forth
[34:17] into huh and since I said then there
[34:22] were many feelings in the Bible they
[34:26] received the Holy Ghost but didn't they
[34:28] gather together and they'd receive a
[34:30] refilling did that mean they didn't have
[34:34] the hope to go then they finally got to
[34:35] hold it oh no it's a refilling it's the
[34:40] growth development of journeys of
[34:41] Christian through to Jesus Christ into
[34:45] each one of us that you're being born
[34:50] again that's what Peter at UM by being
[34:55] born again well I got Holy Ghost when I
[35:00] when I now you're doing the same thing
[35:04] as I said while ago the Prophet said
[35:05] people do it so you say well I got the
[35:08] Holy Ghost when I come in this message
[35:10] well now are you doing that like the
[35:12] others were saying it it it's a baptism
[35:15] or that it's a this or is it that what
[35:17] is it when can you say that you really
[35:24] know you were born again because if you
[35:28] don't know when you were born again you
[35:30] can't know know nothing about a growth
[35:32] development but that's what's what was
[35:34] lost the new bird now listen to what I'm
[35:38] trying to explain come on
[35:41] as far as talking about being born again
[35:44] the new birth and the time that wasn't
[35:46] lost during the ages he's Church taught
[35:51] that during the ages even though Luther
[35:54] would come out to the preaching to just
[35:56] shall live by faith that was still
[35:58] talking about the new birth
[36:02] but what had been lost sure it was lost
[36:08] to what you're believing yes but what
[36:13] was really lost in the ages the statue
[36:17] of a perfect man
[36:18] the fact that we need these virtues
[36:21] because we think we've got it we're born
[36:25] again we got it and we got all these
[36:28] virtues we got it well see then that's
[36:31] Pross holding us here that's what's kept
[36:36] us here for 50 years that God is trying
[36:39] to get his word to us since they're
[36:41] going away of the profit to get us to
[36:45] settle down to what we believe and how
[36:48] the word is true but you see we know for
[36:57] a certainty that you have to be born
[37:00] again that was never lost it was not
[37:03] lost in the ages that you needed to be
[37:06] born again
[37:07] it was lost into the route or way or
[37:13] what do you want to say the way that is
[37:15] to take place was lost yeah because then
[37:19] churches come out of it saying this
[37:20] because you believe or it's because you
[37:22] shout arts because you cry arts because
[37:25] you're this because of that and none of
[37:27] that is the new birth there's no new
[37:31] purchase because you shouted or cried or
[37:33] whatever you got to make the new birth
[37:35] that's something that takes place then
[37:37] you get to shout and then you get to
[37:40] speaking in tongue then you get the
[37:42] things get the baby here first through
[37:49] the new birth let's see how do you
[37:53] believe because that's exactly what he's
[37:55] saying see what's he saying in the
[38:00] statement before when he said I can
[38:02] conclusively prove by the Bible that you
[38:06] are born again and then baptized into
[38:10] the body
[38:14] do you can't add it to her that you're
[38:17] adding a different stage to it
[38:21] the progressiveness of that of the holy
[38:24] ghost coming into you and I see then you
[38:28] can see that we're truly being born
[38:30] again we said what but brother Dale you
[38:37] just so confuses because you the way you
[38:41] talk well we read what a prophet had to
[38:46] say he said I can prove it
[38:50] do we believe it that way no I believe
[38:54] you're born again you know and and I
[38:57] don't know about these Oh we'll see what
[39:00] was eaten away was the statue of a
[39:03] perfect man the adoption the deeper
[39:10] teachings I've heard adoption taught in
[39:15] the Baptist Church come on church let's
[39:21] see we try to make it with our own
[39:23] thoughts and ideas or something and not
[39:25] realizing we're doing the same thing
[39:27] that mankind has always done we're
[39:30] taking our idea put it together with a
[39:33] prophet to try to make it come out of
[39:35] something that we can comprehend you
[39:40] don't need to comprehend the new birth
[39:43] you need to die to yourself and accept
[39:47] Jesus Christ as your Savior
[39:49] there ain't no comprehending comprehend
[39:54] and comes after you get the new birth
[39:59] right before the end you only got mental
[40:02] comprehending see that's why you can't
[40:06] lay it on that you can't lay it on to
[40:09] this say I got it when I believe are you
[40:17] for
[40:17] and me not make-believing
[40:25] but when you truly believe God country
[40:30] already treating prophet said God comes
[40:31] and lives in you and its own down below
[40:34] the wreck city makes you a new creature
[40:41] well I just don't understand how that
[40:43] you you you talk about that well have I
[40:46] said anything he didn't say did it I
[40:48] mean have we read what he's saying I
[40:50] didn't make the statement he's the one
[40:54] that said it I can prove I teach and
[41:01] believe and believe can sufficiently
[41:04] prove by the scriptures that you're born
[41:07] to the Spirit and then baptized into the
[41:10] body by the Holy Spirit
[41:16] see this is back in 62 and he was
[41:21] teaching the statue of a perfect man so
[41:26] what are you being done as these virtues
[41:28] come forth we are being baptized into
[41:32] the body by the opening of God's Word
[41:38] it's being born again as Peter says why
[41:45] can't we see it that away instead well
[41:47] I've done had a new birth what I need
[41:48] anymore a certain person one time we're
[41:52] talking about sanctification they said
[41:54] I've been sanctified I don't need to
[41:55] hear none about no sanctification okay
[42:01] that's your problem ain't mine is your
[42:05] flag go all the way through the Bible
[42:07] them out through the seals and oh
[42:09] nothing and everything else through that
[42:11] all the way to the future home we
[42:15] believe it in sanctification because it
[42:17] don't stop see that's what I've tried to
[42:21] get you to see your new birth don't stop
[42:24] it's not just one lump sum blue see
[42:28] that's what we want it to be just one
[42:29] blue I got it
[42:31] I got it instead of a growth development
[42:35] and how would you have your children
[42:39] here under that form have to grow into
[42:47] that we have to grow into him
[42:52] is that a coordinate is Chris and what
[42:56] does he say
[43:01] but now as far as having eternal life
[43:04] and being a Christian you're a Christian
[43:07] the moment you believe
[43:10] well that's Baptist doctrine well then
[43:12] you argue him he I just read it is he
[43:17] teaching Baptist doctrine if he is why
[43:23] is he saying it's a little contrary to
[43:25] everybody else right maybe another
[43:28] message but that's what he said right
[43:30] why would you always people who was
[43:33] against him and what he was teaching
[43:34] because he teaching things they didn't
[43:37] understand right he turning off when you
[43:46] believe it then I believe by one
[43:49] spiritual baptized into the body of
[43:51] believers then they clarified it by what
[43:56] he's saying not make believe but truly
[44:00] believe on the Lord Jesus and accept him
[44:03] as your personal Savior you're born
[44:05] again right there and have eternal life
[44:07] God comes into you now is he teaching
[44:14] something that doesn't sound the way
[44:17] that we used to believe or is he so
[44:22] confused well I can show you later where
[44:25] he said this well okay you're in that
[44:26] category what the Prophet was missed it
[44:29] here in misses are and I found where he
[44:31] missed it well just glory hallelujah go
[44:35] on with your little pity patter but
[44:36] don't come around here pity pattern we
[44:41] talk plain don't don't come around here
[44:43] to try to bring ideas like something
[44:44] like
[44:45] come we got no room for it me see not
[44:51] make believe truly believe but spies
[44:57] from death unto life you're a new
[44:59] creature right then a new creature what
[45:06] about it then why is it so confusing to
[45:20] try to understand a simple thing of the
[45:24] new birth now listen
[45:30] it wouldn't be confusing if everybody
[45:33] believed the new birth is a birth of the
[45:36] word oh okay I'm putting it out here she
[45:47] ought to me if everybody believes it's
[45:50] the birth of the word what sure what's
[45:52] the problem what's the new birth birth
[45:54] of the word what's the new birth birth
[45:56] for the word what the Prophet said the
[45:59] new birth revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:01] personally to you what's the new birth
[46:04] birth of the word alright what's the
[46:08] statute of a perfect man built by the
[46:10] birth of the word do you understand what
[46:14] I'm saying
[46:15] there was never an age did not have the
[46:19] new birth faith that was not taken away
[46:25] like my wife always used to say it was
[46:27] not the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[46:32] was taken away it was the word that the
[46:37] bug ate down and you can only work an
[46:42] amount of word that you have in the
[46:44] baptism when the Holy Ghost can only
[46:45] work in that point so what is that see
[46:50] what was taken away in the dark ages
[46:57] the teaching of the stature of a perfect
[47:01] man
[47:04] the teaching of perfection and what it
[47:10] takes to be perfected or perfect what
[47:14] was taken away not the new birth every
[47:18] age had the new birth but they did not
[47:24] have the way to attain to anything
[47:27] further than that new birth then we
[47:30] covered it the other day trying to get
[47:32] you to see it whites been doing it in
[47:34] the age isn't coming down see that pure
[47:36] unadulterated word Bertrand said lysed
[47:38] it till about two four trkage so you
[47:41] configure that and when you coming up to
[47:43] the fourth age that you're up in here
[47:45] who are Martin and Columba and then was
[47:46] that and they were teaching the stature
[47:49] of a perfect man they were teaching
[47:50] adoption brother Brown said that was
[47:52] nothing greater outside the Lord Jesus
[47:54] than st. Martin and that's his words may
[48:02] be paraphrasing higher but it's right
[48:05] see because those men had understanding
[48:09] of the truth of the growth development
[48:11] of Christianity he said it let's see who
[48:15] was it Martin that they had miracles and
[48:18] ever service I believe that's right one
[48:21] of those men that were talking about
[48:22] said they had miracles and ever service
[48:25] mm-hmm why because they were Christians
[48:29] and they wouldn't just little babies but
[48:32] they were teaching the babies how to
[48:34] become adults and that's what Peter was
[48:37] doing
[48:39] that's what Paul was doing trying to
[48:44] bring us to an understanding what
[48:52] does it get confusing I know I'm placing
[48:55] out two or three things in this message
[48:57] tonight that each one I'm demanding for
[49:01] you to think or to make up your mind to
[49:03] what you believe do you believe the new
[49:05] birth away the Prophet told you that he
[49:12] said I can prove and and declare it from
[49:15] the Word of God that you're born again
[49:17] and baptized the end of the body
[49:18] well that like that looks like two
[49:20] things it's not two things when you see
[49:23] what it is one of them brings you into
[49:25] the body the other one is a growth
[49:26] development a natural baby is born into
[49:29] the world they don't get born in morning
[49:32] born after then but it eats and grows so
[49:38] is it with a Christian all right we see
[49:45] what was lost with the statue of a
[49:48] perfect man because they knew nothing
[49:54] about that teaching oh that well we got
[49:58] all these things we got all these
[50:00] virtues inside go ahead to number six
[50:09] number five excuse me
[50:10] no we all we go to that one that would
[50:14] be fine three 299 he says then what does
[50:21] it go then genuine temperance genuine
[50:24] patient see you're moving right on up
[50:27] the line
[50:29] you're coming forth into what God wants
[50:32] so read in between all the different
[50:34] things now bring it on up to where we
[50:36] can go to the lysed and be you Darfur
[50:40] perfect what's that perfect even as your
[50:42] father in heaven is perfect
[50:45] now do we believe that we're perfect
[50:50] then why do we say when I'm perfect you
[50:53] ain't either
[50:56] God says we're perfect
[51:03] were denying what he says come on listen
[51:05] and look this is what I like
[51:08] he's coming up and bring it up into the
[51:11] virtues or not and look and says you got
[51:13] up here now before you're asked to do
[51:16] that what was that message what is right
[51:17] back before that be therefore perfect
[51:20] Matthew 5:48 it says well you can't be
[51:24] pretty he said oh yes you can he said
[51:27] cause godliness requires the fact that
[51:28] you'd be perfect right have we been
[51:33] through the message and you've got way
[51:35] up here now before you're asked to do
[51:37] that yesterday one has to be perfect
[51:40] before you're asked to understand what
[51:44] perfection really is you've got to grow
[51:47] through faith virtue knowledge
[51:49] temperance patience you begin to get
[51:53] into a positional understanding because
[51:56] we're going to read that one but then
[51:57] you go to godliness growing in grace and
[52:04] knowledge growing up to it then he
[52:08] expects you to understand what it is
[52:11] about perfect you don't wait till you
[52:15] come up there to be made perfect you
[52:17] wait to come up there to understand
[52:21] understand what God has done for you you
[52:27] see one church look what I've tried to
[52:30] tell you from the beginning that's why
[52:32] most people are not going to make it in
[52:35] the change of the body it's because
[52:39] they've never been taught that they need
[52:41] these virtues they're scared of the
[52:46] message of anything that you try to
[52:48] direct them into and I wasn't the one
[52:52] that wrote 327 Church age book that you
[52:55] don't like when me to quote where the
[52:56] Prophet says what this measure of
[52:58] Malachi 4 Luke 17 there to do two things
[53:00] turn the hearts of the children back to
[53:02] the faith of the Father and reveal the
[53:03] seven thunders which is a revelation
[53:05] obtained in the seven seals
[53:06] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[53:08] truths that literally turn our hearts
[53:09] back within efficient if those things
[53:11] are not preached our hearts can't be
[53:13] turned back
[53:15] so we're going to keep going and dying
[53:17] going by the grave see you take it wrong
[53:28] when I try to say things but look you
[53:34] got up here now before he asked you to
[53:36] do that
[53:37] all these things has to be added then
[53:39] when you get up here he asked you now to
[53:41] be perfect God in his sons and daughters
[53:45] of God well coming all the way up to
[53:49] godliness now he expects you to
[53:53] understand what godliness is right he
[54:03] expects us to understand that now you
[54:05] remember this one blasphemy is 9 go
[54:07] ahead number 6 277 paragraph and what
[54:11] did he say patience and don't don't you
[54:13] worry st. no court then count them for
[54:16] you I'm climbing up the ladder now look
[54:19] I've added virtue knowledge temperance
[54:22] now I gotta add patience I still ain't
[54:25] got to hold it goes remember that two or
[54:29] three weeks we're trying to go through
[54:31] that what is the Prophet saying I mean
[54:36] you read what he was to say what's he
[54:38] saying you ain't got all the Holy Ghost
[54:48] right that's what he's saying you ain't
[54:52] got all of it what's he saying you ain't
[54:55] got it no he done told you got the Holy
[54:56] Ghost in the new birth of faith he then
[55:02] told us what we got the new birth and
[55:04] how that it makes us perfect but we
[55:06] don't have the understanding of it
[55:08] because it's so hard for us to believe
[55:10] that we as human beings can be perfect
[55:14] well he puts it at godliness where it's
[55:17] required then we understand being
[55:22] perfect and how we are perfect
[55:26] I wish to goodness is you take my advice
[55:28] and do one thing that if you would
[55:30] listen our read Hebrews chapter five and
[55:34] six
[55:35] especially one verse five and six and
[55:37] read all the things the prophets said
[55:40] about some time go we're fixing to get
[55:42] onto that beam
[55:46] do you understand the new birth wasn't
[55:51] lost
[55:53] it was the growth development in
[55:56] Christianity of trying to come to the
[55:59] stature of a perfect man
[56:00] it was the teachings of Peter in them
[56:03] the teaching of Paul of adoption that
[56:08] was what was lost in the dark ages they
[56:13] everyone had the new birth you know it
[56:18] was the birth for that age come on read
[56:20] the message brother around and preach
[56:21] the whole message don't why the Holy
[56:23] Ghost of these age there was no age
[56:26] without the baptism in the old ago which
[56:28] was eternal life so what was lost the
[56:35] growth development of Christianity the
[56:38] teachings of growth development the
[56:40] teaching of what we have need of and
[56:44] look what he says he said you come up
[56:46] here to patience lift up here amid
[56:48] patient he said you ain't got the Holy
[56:50] Ghost yet that's called the doctor and
[56:53] in this message that we faced years ago
[56:55] to see through you ain't got the Holy
[56:57] Ghost yet well that's exactly right I
[57:02] never got down to reading all of the
[57:05] scripture I want to read in Peter but
[57:07] we're gonna get to it how about this
[57:10] scripture add to your faith virtue
[57:14] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[57:16] verse eight says if these things be in
[57:19] you and abound they make you that ye
[57:22] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[57:24] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[57:27] Christ
[57:28] if these virtues be in you but what
[57:32] about the next one what about verse nine
[57:35] but he that lacketh these things
[57:39] is blind and cannot see afar off and
[57:42] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[57:45] his old sins he that lacketh these
[57:49] things what about that being written to
[57:57] Christians now oh I was a Christian
[58:05] blind and cannot see a phone wrong he's
[58:14] it like at these things it's blind
[58:17] I ain't quoting I'm reading the Bible
[58:20] right see we're not through yet with a
[58:23] statue of a perfect man we just gettin
[58:26] started
[58:31] then got to that scripture we think
[58:35] about having these things no but when he
[58:37] says we don't have them we can wind up
[58:40] being blind but what if you got one of
[58:49] these things what if you got the new
[58:53] birth you're not blind
[58:59] that is just talking to Christians right
[59:03] you're not blind yeah but what what do
[59:12] you mean I mean just what the scripture
[59:14] says he that lacketh these things is
[59:17] blind if we don't have them we're blind
[59:20] and cannot see afar off I don't care how
[59:24] much you claim to believe the prophets
[59:25] message or what we haul in screen we're
[59:29] blind
[59:31] well what if we have one of these
[59:33] virtues called faith then it's not
[59:36] talking about it Oh glory the day I saw
[59:41] that I done some shouting of my own and
[59:45] I wrote it in my Bible if I have one of
[59:50] these things
[59:52] I don't lack them so I'm not blind thank
[59:56] you lord
[59:56] there is an ability to move on because
[1:00:00] I'm not blind
[1:00:02] see we blind our own selves all right
[1:00:08] now we've been through this on Ephesians
[1:00:13] forward let's go to number seven we've
[1:00:16] been through this about the statue of a
[1:00:18] perfect man and about the disciples and
[1:00:20] how what they were to be all right but
[1:00:23] now we're going to approach it just a
[1:00:25] little bit stronger because we're going
[1:00:28] to Ephesians 4 and 11 and he gave some
[1:00:31] apostles from prophets evangelists
[1:00:33] pastors teachers for the perfecting of
[1:00:35] the Saints now if you want me to read it
[1:00:38] I'll give it in a minute brother Ron
[1:00:39] said the fivefold ministry was for the
[1:00:42] perfecting of the science you say well
[1:00:44] he said well bring me what he said I
[1:00:47] want to see where brother Branham says
[1:00:49] that his that brother Branham was for
[1:00:52] the perfecting of the science I want to
[1:00:54] see that now I'm serious I'll come right
[1:00:56] back here and call your name and say you
[1:00:59] corrected me because I've studied the
[1:01:02] message I can't find it without this
[1:01:04] message of the fivefold ministry don't
[1:01:06] have anything to bring I'll preach that
[1:01:10] to you from day one we don't have a
[1:01:13] message fivefold ministry no helmet is
[1:01:16] to take this message and break it down
[1:01:18] to the people come on but look for the
[1:01:29] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:01:31] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:01:33] body of Christ what till we all come in
[1:01:35] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:01:37] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:01:39] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:01:41] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:01:43] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:01:45] to and fro and curd about with every
[1:01:47] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[1:01:49] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:01:52] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:01:54] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:01:58] all things which is the head no the
[1:02:05] it brought the message of how for
[1:02:06] ministry supposed to break it down for
[1:02:08] us
[1:02:09] of course that's why most people don't
[1:02:11] believe in the five full minutes and
[1:02:12] I've told you I don't have no problem
[1:02:14] there's a lot of people call herself
[1:02:15] five whole minutes triangle listen to
[1:02:17] and I get sick of sometimes hearing some
[1:02:20] of the people y'all listen to and wonder
[1:02:22] where the world that you miss that hat
[1:02:24] ain't saying you can't listen nobody
[1:02:27] never taught nothing like that what you
[1:02:29] eat you spend your time listening to
[1:02:31] something like that no see I wonder
[1:02:34] what's going on all right but you see
[1:02:39] that ain't where I want to stop that we
[1:02:42] make grow up in him and all things but a
[1:02:46] number right first Peter two and one
[1:02:51] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:02:53] garland hypocrisy and envies and all
[1:02:55] beacon as newborn babes desire the
[1:02:58] sincere milk of the word that we may
[1:02:59] grow there by we're all born babies in
[1:03:05] Christ and must grow up in him
[1:03:08] okay cool tonight second Peter 3 and 18
[1:03:11] but growing Grayson and a knowledge of
[1:03:14] our Lord and say grow into we've got to
[1:03:16] have a growth development that's the
[1:03:18] statue of a perfect man but now listen
[1:03:21] now let's get to what we're going to get
[1:03:24] to I told you we had two things we
[1:03:26] brought we brought statue of perfect man
[1:03:28] from Peter we brought adoption from Paul
[1:03:32] now let's take the third one to anchor
[1:03:35] it into the doing and then you'll see
[1:03:37] that what I do a lot of times I tell you
[1:03:39] I just sometimes I lay these things
[1:03:41] aside and then I wait till the time to
[1:03:43] come so now in the mouth of two or three
[1:03:44] witnesses let's see if we can get
[1:03:46] another witness out of the Bible that
[1:03:51] mankind has never understood the Word of
[1:03:54] God he tries to make it say what he
[1:03:58] wants it to say he has it in his own
[1:04:01] concept fourth office in Dar ba he's had
[1:04:04] a thousand different denomination and
[1:04:06] he's had a thousand different ways of
[1:04:08] the new birth and there's ten thousand
[1:04:10] of them in this message
[1:04:16] okay waiter number nine
[1:04:26] Hebrews five of whom we have many things
[1:04:30] to say and hard to be uttered seeing
[1:04:33] your dull ax here any somewhat
[1:04:35] melchester day come on okay for when for
[1:04:38] the time ye ought to be teachers you
[1:04:42] have need that one teach you again which
[1:04:43] be the first principles of the Oracles
[1:04:47] which is the word Oracle's law Word of
[1:04:51] God and our becoming such as have need
[1:04:54] of milk and not of strong meat now what
[1:04:56] about somebody what about a situation
[1:05:00] where somebody has grown up a little to
[1:05:06] get past the milk but then they go back
[1:05:08] to the milk is that what it's saying for
[1:05:14] when the time you ought to be teachers
[1:05:15] you now need that one teach you again
[1:05:17] which be the first principles or
[1:05:19] Oracle's and are become such as how as
[1:05:22] have need of milk and not a strong lead
[1:05:25] what about somebody strong enough to
[1:05:30] think they're away from milk but then
[1:05:33] they have to go back to milk is that
[1:05:36] what Paul said no words Paul said going
[1:05:38] back to the very principles the word
[1:05:40] principle means beginning right now what
[1:05:45] was he say everyone that uses milk is
[1:05:47] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:05:48] for he is a baby but strong meat belong
[1:05:52] to them that are a full age even those
[1:05:55] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:05:57] exercised to discern discern both good
[1:06:00] and evil roll to the net therefore
[1:06:09] leaving the principles of the doctor
[1:06:14] Christ let us go on unto perfection not
[1:06:24] laying again the foundation of
[1:06:25] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:06:28] towards God of the doctrines of baptisms
[1:06:31] and of laying on of hands and a
[1:06:34] resurrection of the Dead an eternal
[1:06:36] judgment and this we will do if God
[1:06:39] permit ours number three therefore
[1:06:44] leaving the principles
[1:06:46] what is the principles the beginning all
[1:06:52] right the beginning principles let us go
[1:06:57] on to perfection so now Paul is still
[1:07:00] right into the basis of where he brought
[1:07:03] out and Peter with godliness as to being
[1:07:08] perfection right did not Paul bring it
[1:07:15] out and Peter bring it out our
[1:07:17] perfection did not Peter talked about it
[1:07:19] didn't brother Brown the statue a
[1:07:20] perfect man talk about what you come all
[1:07:23] this way now and God expects you to be
[1:07:25] perfect
[1:07:26] we're up to godliness here's another
[1:07:29] example in the Word of God
[1:07:32] number three therefore leaving the
[1:07:35] principles now how do you leave
[1:07:38] principles in Christian terminology what
[1:07:41] is your problem when I asked you to read
[1:07:42] Hebrews 5 6 and 5 and 6 is 105 and 6 and
[1:07:47] see of the Hebrews series or listen to
[1:07:51] the tape you hear him explain what
[1:07:55] principles and things are now what is
[1:08:00] Paul saying therefore leaving the
[1:08:04] principles does that mean we do away
[1:08:11] with them does that mean that you did
[1:08:16] forget all of it and we just holler how
[1:08:20] perfect we are what does that mean
[1:08:25] how can you
[1:08:27] the principles and go on and many of you
[1:08:35] can ride a bicycle
[1:08:36] Oh mr. Mehta everybody in here at one
[1:08:40] time or other could ride a bicycle
[1:08:43] now how about doing me a favor when you
[1:08:47] get home forget about how to ride it and
[1:08:49] get on it and take off therefore leaving
[1:08:55] the principles of the doctrine Chrysler
[1:08:56] that's going to perfection
[1:08:59] well why don't you jump on the bicycle
[1:09:01] and tenhoff you know yourself that it
[1:09:05] depended upon that human brain that has
[1:09:08] been so set until it's a fact that it's
[1:09:12] not having to you don't have to think
[1:09:14] about pedal you don't have to think
[1:09:15] about moving you know how to talk about
[1:09:17] leaning you want to it's all
[1:09:19] mechanically involved within you as a
[1:09:21] human being that you never forget from
[1:09:24] the time you're five years old or
[1:09:26] learning to ride a bicycle and the time
[1:09:29] you get to be 80 years old you may get a
[1:09:31] little dot early but you can still ride
[1:09:33] it right now that's leaving the
[1:09:37] principles well what is leaving the
[1:09:45] principles principles means the
[1:09:48] beginnings I can give you the definition
[1:09:50] of the word is in what principles means
[1:09:54] and we're supposed to leave the
[1:09:57] principles how do you leave principles
[1:10:00] but yet keep those principles as the
[1:10:02] very foundation of what you're doing
[1:10:05] it's Paul saying all right now let's
[1:10:07] forget about all the Apostles is talk
[1:10:09] and let's go on to perfection is that
[1:10:11] what he say him no but what was for Paul
[1:10:18] facing you'll find brother branham
[1:10:21] explaining this if you'll read and
[1:10:23] listen you got every time for everything
[1:10:25] else won't you read and listen you'll
[1:10:27] find Paul saying
[1:10:31] you have made so much on this beginnings
[1:10:35] until you're not going on that's what it
[1:10:42] was a meaning when he said therefore
[1:10:43] leaving the principles have you stayed
[1:10:45] with the principles what's wrong with
[1:10:48] staying with the principle brother
[1:10:49] branham I got it laying here do you need
[1:10:51] them we're brother Brown and said we've
[1:10:52] got to stay with the principles what are
[1:10:54] the principles the beginnings
[1:10:56] what do you realize then and well so got
[1:10:58] it right in here laying we'll get to it
[1:11:00] a minute that Paul calls it carnal
[1:11:03] reform brother branham calls a carnal
[1:11:08] reform for us to stay with something and
[1:11:11] not move on you see what went wrong what
[1:11:19] was took away during their ages with the
[1:11:21] ability to come to perfection
[1:11:23] or to understand leaving the principles
[1:11:24] and run around and said Paul was
[1:11:26] speaking to the to the children of
[1:11:29] Israel when he was saying those things
[1:11:33] that they had got away from the
[1:11:36] principles I wanted to stay with the
[1:11:41] principles would put it anyway and not
[1:11:43] go on in perfection principles was all
[1:11:47] the Old Testament and what it spoke of
[1:11:49] when Paul stood dire talking about the
[1:11:52] principles to make us something to go
[1:11:54] into perfect he's talking about the
[1:11:55] whole entire Old Testament background to
[1:11:58] bring him to that place and he says now
[1:12:00] let's leave this from the wall leave it
[1:12:03] like getting away from it no see that's
[1:12:06] where the carnality of your mind will
[1:12:08] run it I didn't say that you can't stop
[1:12:11] your principles your principles are
[1:12:14] always there your beginnings cannot be
[1:12:16] done away with because if you've done
[1:12:18] away with your beginnings you'd have to
[1:12:20] go back to that that's what Paul's
[1:12:21] explaining see those Jews laid on those
[1:12:26] principles and Paul was saying all of
[1:12:30] those principles spoke of Jesus Christ
[1:12:33] and he's riding now listen he's writing
[1:12:36] to the Hebrews he's not writing to
[1:12:39] carnal Unruh generated Israelis
[1:12:45] now we just dropped a bomb didn't Paul
[1:12:49] is not talking to the is unconverted
[1:12:52] Israelis he's talking to the converted
[1:12:57] Hebrews and said why do you want to go
[1:13:04] back to that all of that spoke of Jesus
[1:13:09] Christ can't you see what he's saying he
[1:13:15] said look I come to church last week and
[1:13:17] said I heard all about Jesus
[1:13:19] now listen and don't go carnal on your
[1:13:22] mind listen to what I'm illustrating
[1:13:25] Paul said come to church last week and
[1:13:28] said how you preached was Jesus was God
[1:13:30] I'm quoting brother Branham out of there
[1:13:33] oh you're preaching that Jesus was God
[1:13:37] you preached in his name and this that
[1:13:40] and the other he said cut out all of
[1:13:42] that blown blown to perfection well what
[1:13:48] is for cooling the perfect
[1:13:50] we already got Jesus knowing all about
[1:13:52] Jesus knowing all about this no not
[1:13:54] about one God water baptism no eternal
[1:13:57] hell all of those principles now I'm
[1:14:04] going to state it so you can do what you
[1:14:06] want to go home the statue of a perfect
[1:14:10] man the faith of the father's we can
[1:14:14] dwell on that so much until all we're
[1:14:16] doing is making it principals there will
[1:14:19] not take us on to perfection
[1:14:25] the prophets message was not was not the
[1:14:32] faith of the father's he had to come and
[1:14:36] bring it to restore the faith but his
[1:14:39] message begun through the opening of the
[1:14:41] seals come on
[1:14:45] so what could brother Branham stand and
[1:14:48] say like he says here leaving the
[1:14:50] principles let us go on to perfection
[1:14:54] all right
[1:15:00] let's read coder number 17
[1:15:06] Hebrews chapter 6 and last Sunday we
[1:15:10] taken leaving the principles of the
[1:15:13] doctrine of Christ in the sixth chapter
[1:15:16] we read this let us go on to perfection
[1:15:18] and we found out that the people today
[1:15:21] in many churches along with the Branham
[1:15:26] tabernacle and different ones we lay to
[1:15:30] much own study about the principles of
[1:15:34] Christ he was the son of God a son of
[1:15:38] Abraham see that's what we studying he
[1:15:40] was the son of sonu and on back the
[1:15:43] genealogies but the Bible said let us
[1:15:45] lay aside those things and go on to
[1:15:48] perfection last side all the doctrines
[1:15:54] that he told that's not laying something
[1:15:57] down or throwing it down right because
[1:16:00] look at the rest of it first you must
[1:16:02] know the doctrine you can't lay
[1:16:07] something side that you don't know first
[1:16:11] you must know the doctrine then you must
[1:16:14] know all these things then lat then
[1:16:18] let's lay them aside
[1:16:19] I read Hebrews we're talking about even
[1:16:26] the resurrection of the Dead
[1:16:27] he said of the resurrection of the Dead
[1:16:30] laying on of the hands baptisms and all
[1:16:33] of those dead articles of God did we
[1:16:39] read it and yet they have no life in
[1:16:44] them come on I'm reading what he says
[1:16:50] but the church today just goes to those
[1:16:54] things oh we believe in the deity of
[1:16:56] Jesus of Christ yes we believe in water
[1:17:00] baptism yes you're laying on her hands
[1:17:03] Paul said we'll do all this if God
[1:17:05] permits but in the face of all that
[1:17:09] let's lay it aside and go on to
[1:17:12] perfection well I've asked you to read
[1:17:18] what he says you'll find him in our
[1:17:21] comfort and carnal reform as water
[1:17:24] baptism let's see if I can find it go to
[1:17:38] number 13
[1:17:39] how many enjoyed the message on
[1:17:41] perfection that it's going to perfection
[1:17:44] that was our message this morning in the
[1:17:46] sixth chapter we're just getting into
[1:17:49] places to where we begin to get the real
[1:17:52] part oh we can all agree upon these
[1:17:55] things upon the deity of Christ and him
[1:17:59] being the son of God and how he was God
[1:18:01] and God was with him and he was in God
[1:18:05] know how we're going to agree excuse me
[1:18:10] he was in God and God in him so forth we
[1:18:14] all a grip on that but now from your own
[1:18:17] I don't know we're going to agree I
[1:18:26] didn't say this look
[1:18:37] just now from your own I don't know how
[1:18:39] we're going to agree or whatsoever it is
[1:18:45] he said I'm gonna give you a chance to
[1:18:47] write me a question from here own no
[1:18:49] question rate what are you saying are we
[1:18:55] to do away if therefore leaving the
[1:18:57] principles is that to do away with all
[1:18:58] those I know he said we've got to know
[1:19:00] the doctrine all right you got to know
[1:19:03] the doctrine you got to get that right
[1:19:04] but then because you know the doctrine
[1:19:07] don't mean you got it okay going down to
[1:19:13] the next 114 watch this let's get this
[1:19:16] word perfection do you know that there's
[1:19:19] only one way you'll stand in the
[1:19:21] presence of God that's perfect
[1:19:22] God cannot tolerate unholy things and
[1:19:25] you legalist how could you ever perfect
[1:19:29] yourself when you have not one thing to
[1:19:34] perfect yourself with you were born in
[1:19:37] sin your very conception was sin the
[1:19:40] very desire of your being was sin unless
[1:19:44] he goes on to the lives unless you're
[1:19:46] born again your loss legalist what's
[1:19:50] legalism
[1:19:57] what's carnal reform what's Reformation
[1:20:04] now come on that's where I say it let's
[1:20:08] see if you keep on agreeing now as
[1:20:11] brother running said let's see from now
[1:20:13] and if you agree what is carnal reform
[1:20:16] things that you think is what's making
[1:20:19] you right right
[1:20:22] you think it's what's making you right
[1:20:25] because you don't do or you do do come
[1:20:36] on
[1:20:41] what is carnal reformed things that we
[1:20:46] think is what's making us right how many
[1:20:51] of you sisters think you're right
[1:20:53] because you don't cut your hair when the
[1:21:00] prostitutes in my day would not cut
[1:21:02] their hair that's too blunt brother Dale
[1:21:07] but it was the truth you think you don't
[1:21:15] do this or you don't do that or you do
[1:21:16] this or do that
[1:21:19] carnal reform now listen
[1:21:22] he's ready to rent him a contrary to it
[1:21:24] he said let's get the doctrine right so
[1:21:28] what is the doctrine don't cut your
[1:21:30] heart after plain language that a
[1:21:33] revelation that's plain language don't
[1:21:36] worry your clothes taught women to wear
[1:21:40] that men could look at your letter no
[1:21:41] why are your splits that come up in the
[1:21:43] backs and everything don't worry off
[1:21:45] like that we believe in that we believe
[1:21:47] in living right we believe in being
[1:21:50] Christians right but let it be because
[1:21:57] Christ is living in us now it's not
[1:22:01] legalism its Christ living in you but
[1:22:09] until then it's a carnal reformed I
[1:22:15] didn't say it your prophet is talking
[1:22:18] about water baptism and it being right
[1:22:20] and there's no eternal hills and and the
[1:22:23] resurrection of the Dead
[1:22:24] Paul's talking about it but he calls it
[1:22:29] reform if that's that all we gonna do
[1:22:33] those are just a foundation those things
[1:22:40] that we've we've got our doctrines
[1:22:42] anchored we believe in one God water
[1:22:43] baptism no eternal hell serpent seed
[1:22:46] predestination we've got all of that
[1:22:48] ride why because we got the prophets
[1:22:52] words all right
[1:22:54] but now let's go on to perfection I
[1:23:01] don't believe is nobody can teach me and
[1:23:04] so I you'll stay in your carnal reform
[1:23:07] because that's what it is I don't need
[1:23:10] nobody to straighten me out your carnal
[1:23:12] reform stay in it that's fine you go
[1:23:16] ahead that's your business but therefore
[1:23:21] leaving the principles you understand
[1:23:23] what I'm getting at number one we
[1:23:27] covered a statue of perfect man we must
[1:23:29] have these virtues in us to be Christ in
[1:23:31] us a rapture for a bride a rapture for
[1:23:36] an individual etc depends upon these
[1:23:39] virtues Paul come forth in adoption and
[1:23:43] takes it all the way to wit and I love
[1:23:47] that so much until you don't understand
[1:23:49] how much I love the way he talks Paul's
[1:23:51] got it in his talking people read him I
[1:23:54] don't understand him Paul didn't say the
[1:24:00] change of the body because he couldn't
[1:24:02] do nothing but prophesy of it
[1:24:04] he could prophesy of the change the
[1:24:07] different things but he could not make
[1:24:09] it manifest so he was still hung on that
[1:24:12] so he said to wit the redemption of the
[1:24:16] body to understand these things he would
[1:24:20] take a prophet to come then for us to
[1:24:22] understand these things of the chains of
[1:24:24] the body and the things that was to take
[1:24:26] place and that was his message that
[1:24:30] begin through the opening of the seals
[1:24:32] and brought that message the others was
[1:24:37] a restoration back to the faith of the
[1:24:39] fathers bringing back to them then he
[1:24:42] stood on that and he looked at Paul and
[1:24:43] he said therefore leaving the principles
[1:24:45] of the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[1:24:48] come on I'll give it to you there the
[1:24:50] other day read a spoken word an original
[1:24:52] see brother branham ladies message down
[1:24:54] preach this message God told him to pick
[1:24:56] up his Pinder out in other words he had
[1:24:58] his notes written for it he said pick up
[1:24:59] your pen and write he wrote and as he
[1:25:01] went through and he when he come down
[1:25:03] the end of what he say this is right
[1:25:06] this is right all this is right but
[1:25:08] as of yet Malacca 4 is not fulfilled so
[1:25:15] what was brother I'm saying therefore
[1:25:16] leaving the principles of all of this
[1:25:19] background that I've got here of the
[1:25:22] state of the spoken word original seed
[1:25:25] that he took in six hours to preach
[1:25:27] showing were that the Word of God had
[1:25:30] been made manifest again and he said in
[1:25:33] our day and coming he said it come
[1:25:35] through Mary come to this and is all the
[1:25:37] birth of the word and there I stood on
[1:25:39] that word and God said as of yet
[1:25:43] you ain't reached perfection God said
[1:25:49] leaving the principles now of all of
[1:25:52] these things that you've taught you
[1:25:54] brought us back brought the people back
[1:25:56] to the faith of the fathers and
[1:25:58] understanding said now go on through
[1:26:00] perfection what seals try some history
[1:26:07] future home
[1:26:08] who is this melchester the unveiling of
[1:26:11] God masterpiece I've asked you to do it
[1:26:16] I wonder how many people would ever went
[1:26:17] home and done what I've asked you a
[1:26:19] thousand times to do go home tonight if
[1:26:26] you don't have one we'll try to find you
[1:26:27] one
[1:26:27] take the book that lists all the tapes
[1:26:31] the index book get one of them turn over
[1:26:36] to 63 and start with the seals and read
[1:26:41] from their own to 65 just the titles of
[1:26:46] the messages there is not one title in
[1:26:51] all of those messages preached after the
[1:26:54] seals that would be anything outside of
[1:26:58] bringing and glorifying Jesus Christ
[1:27:00] except indictment you might be able to
[1:27:04] deal with indictment because of what he
[1:27:06] had to do it indict but read them Christ
[1:27:09] the mystery that's an eighth day message
[1:27:12] feast of the trumpets I don't care if
[1:27:16] brother so-and-so and you want me to
[1:27:18] call his name his brother so-and-so said
[1:27:20] brother Brian said it made sense
[1:27:22] ministry up to the tongues in a feast of
[1:27:24] the trumpet says you can't understand it
[1:27:26] brother branham in that message said
[1:27:27] it's dust saith the lord now who do you
[1:27:29] think I'm going to believe it's there
[1:27:36] therefore leaving the principles I got
[1:27:43] one more thought to inject and that's
[1:27:45] the headstone coming to the church and
[1:27:47] then we're gonna have to leave the
[1:27:48] principles because all I've talked for
[1:27:51] months and months has been principles
[1:27:59] principles because the faith of the
[1:28:02] fathers is principles when you're
[1:28:06] looking at the seals up ahead of you
[1:28:09] that's why I've always said I believed
[1:28:13] it from the first time I read it I
[1:28:15] believe it today those seven seals is a
[1:28:19] headstone to the church now you tell me
[1:28:23] something else that can be now the seven
[1:28:27] seals is the headstone to the church
[1:28:29] called in the seventh seals is marriage
[1:28:32] in divorce
[1:28:33] am i quoting him n is serpent seed two
[1:28:38] hundred about sixty eight by our fifty
[1:28:40] eight back over here everything it's
[1:28:43] revealed when he come into those seals
[1:28:46] and it opened to a brand-new field but
[1:28:50] what was that brand-new feel no longer
[1:28:53] dealing with principles rather random
[1:28:57] from the time he started his message and
[1:28:59] then come on do I need to quote wrote
[1:29:00] around them like rapture message not in
[1:29:02] the years of preparation not one of
[1:29:05] their says not in the years of the
[1:29:06] healing campaign but he said in the time
[1:29:08] of the opening it's time search we need
[1:29:16] to start thinking about leaving the
[1:29:18] principles
[1:29:25] we ought to have it already settled
[1:29:26] pretty good about one God water baptism
[1:29:28] no eternal hail serpent seed pre
[1:29:31] destinations and all the things now I'm
[1:29:37] going to say this part because this is
[1:29:41] where I always have stood man said it my
[1:29:43] house one day and he was talking about
[1:29:45] something and he said so-and-so and I
[1:29:47] said brother why don't you tell me
[1:29:48] something that pipes the future home I
[1:29:50] said you guys think it's your kind of
[1:29:52] take that brother branham just swept off
[1:29:54] the foundation and you got to build the
[1:29:59] building
[1:29:59] I said start building the building but
[1:30:01] start after the future home cause
[1:30:03] brother Branham preached this desire and
[1:30:05] he just rolled up in his seat and hushed
[1:30:08] because he knew it was the truth I said
[1:30:14] if you think you straight and brother
[1:30:15] Brown them out sweeping it off that
[1:30:16] would be one thing but when you start
[1:30:18] trying to say that you go beyond brother
[1:30:20] Branham and you're supposed to bring
[1:30:21] these things there's no such thing in
[1:30:23] the Word of God that's your to do
[1:30:24] something like that and if you think
[1:30:26] brother Dale thinks that the fivefold
[1:30:28] ministries to bring something contrary
[1:30:30] to the Prophet you need to get some
[1:30:32] principles human principles you need to
[1:30:37] get some beginnings to settle down and
[1:30:39] listen ain't talk for 250 years for that
[1:30:46] I've taught this message all of these
[1:30:49] years on the foundation and I stand
[1:30:50] today I'll be glad for you to listen to
[1:30:53] the tapes from 2002 up because we got
[1:30:56] them we had them all the way back to
[1:30:58] ever build ever tape in this building
[1:30:59] but we had to burn them cuz we didn't
[1:31:01] own the room for him check it out and
[1:31:07] see if I've changed my doctor I preach
[1:31:12] the same thing over a lot because
[1:31:15] there's one thing about it if you keep
[1:31:16] preaching something over finally people
[1:31:18] are gonna get the principles and then we
[1:31:20] can go on to perfection
[1:31:28] brother brands Macy's not beginning
[1:31:30] until 63 the other was a preparation
[1:31:34] the other was principals they had to get
[1:31:39] an order and right come on musicians he
[1:31:43] had to get all of that right the
[1:31:45] principals
[1:31:46] then when he got it all right then the
[1:31:49] seals broke right after the principals
[1:31:55] was right spoken words original seed
[1:31:58] read it as of yet man look how forwards
[1:32:03] don't fulfill he set out right then to
[1:32:06] find melikhaya for he went straight into
[1:32:10] the opening of the seven seals Curtis
[1:32:14] right on the end to the future home
[1:32:18] right taking us all the way to the
[1:32:22] future home we don't need anybody else
[1:32:24] to come along so you to do anything
[1:32:27] we've got the message but we need to
[1:32:30] stop with the star we need to not get
[1:32:32] off and lose the principles we need to
[1:32:34] let the principles be the things that
[1:32:36] holds us up because that's what it's far
[1:32:38] what's holding this building up is the
[1:32:40] foundation this is underneath it don't
[1:32:42] try to tear the foundation out you're
[1:32:43] gonna lose every time when he never
[1:32:46] talked nothing like that it doesn't come
[1:32:47] that away this message is the foundation
[1:32:51] with this messages of growth development
[1:32:52] throughout the statue of a perfect man
[1:32:54] and this message didn't come until after
[1:32:56] the seals broke the other was a
[1:32:58] restoration back to the faith of the
[1:33:00] fathers come on discuss that with me if
[1:33:03] you want to show me where that's wrong
[1:33:06] go see I'm gonna keep throwing it back
[1:33:08] to you say will brother run didn't
[1:33:10] understand this Brian didn't understand
[1:33:13] that but run didn't understand this but
[1:33:16] when the open of the seals came he said
[1:33:18] all was made right he knew right where
[1:33:24] he was standing right let's take what we
[1:33:28] got
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:54] what about it therefore leaving the
[1:33:58] principles got number three now because
[1:34:03] three things that the new something lost
[1:34:06] down through the ages that mankind could
[1:34:09] not Salah and understand and he wound up
[1:34:12] to be the message of the disciples it
[1:34:16] wound up be in the faith of the fathers
[1:34:20] only can we go home when the baby the
[1:34:23] father
[1:34:26] till that we're still in carnal reform
[1:34:29] we're trying to convert each other we're
[1:34:31] trying to get the women to quit doing
[1:34:33] this and the man to quit and ain't it
[1:34:35] kind of funny you don't hear much about
[1:34:37] the men doing wrong it's always the
[1:34:39] women doing wrong my mother made a
[1:34:44] statement years ago what I had to agree
[1:34:46] with it she said a woman said she goes
[1:34:50] out and does one thing wrong since she's
[1:34:52] blackballed the rest of her life
[1:34:53] where's ante around her neck the old
[1:34:55] days now and said that's where it's been
[1:34:58] but said to let a man do anything he
[1:34:59] wants to commit and after doing that
[1:35:03] said he puts a town go to church he's
[1:35:05] called a brother and said mom you ride
[1:35:08] [Music]
[1:35:11] everybody miss message hollered and
[1:35:13] beaten about the women we men have the
[1:35:20] same thing so let's stop and get away
[1:35:25] from the principles let's get down to
[1:35:28] this being Christians not throwing it
[1:35:32] away not doing away Paul didn't say that
[1:35:35] he said therefore leaving the principles
[1:35:37] let us go on to perfection not laying
[1:35:41] again not having to go back over there
[1:35:46] come on that's what he said not laying
[1:35:48] again not going back over these times
[1:35:50] and over these things and over these
[1:35:52] things you see well you sure have done
[1:35:56] that a lot I sure I'll it's about time
[1:35:59] for us to leave the principles start
[1:36:02] marching on and see what God has for us
[1:36:06] it's in the word we like to worry about
[1:36:10] it
[1:36:11] it's dire somebody's gonna catch it and
