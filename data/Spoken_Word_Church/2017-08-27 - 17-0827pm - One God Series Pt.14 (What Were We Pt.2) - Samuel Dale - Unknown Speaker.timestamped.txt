[26:25] I looked at her I thought I'd walk you
[26:27] know piranha right I'll say hi we go way
[26:32] back I couldn't kid with everybody else
[26:34] like that but I can kid LaFrieda ok good
[26:37] to see you
[26:38] alright I've got a question started so

[26:57] to me and we'll try to cover them in a
[27:01] service or something if we get enough it
[27:02] don't I'll just stick into one question
[27:05] and try to answer that ok anybody
[27:09] anything else I write my own self notes
[27:14] no I can't read them because I got so
[27:15] many but just great the Lord would bless
[27:19] father we thank you for this day and
[27:21] you're Greyson to us thank you for all
[27:23] things and we ask you to just bless and
[27:25] guide each one of us
[27:27] and got us into your truth because that

[27:32] else is to be able to walk in the light
[27:33] of your love and father just forgive our

[27:50] and we thank you just have your way now
[27:52] with each one of us and guide us and
[27:54] keep us in Jesus name Amen
[27:58] John 1 then we'll go to Ezekiel 18 in
[28:08] the beginning was the word and the Word
[28:10] was with God and the Word was God and
[28:13] the same was in the beginning with God
[28:16] now that's not two or three persons
[28:18] right that's one person being described
[28:22] but he's describing a downward trend of
[28:26] the way he's coming because he's coming
[28:29] from this great existing one alone
[28:33] coming downward to the word coming on
[28:37] down so yeah and that's why it's
[28:39] covering it like it all right but now
[28:41] look what's this person all things were
[28:44] made by him it's a wonderful person in
[28:47] it
[28:47] and without him was not anything made
[28:49] that was made
[28:51] okay in him was life and the life was
[28:55] the light of men and lights on earth and
[28:57] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[28:59] it not okay because there's no way that
[29:03] darkness can understand light it's too
[29:08] much come true one to the other okay
[29:10] ezekiel 18:4 behold all souls are mine
[29:15] now I don't matter hemming - they are
[29:18] anything you want to claim at this out
[29:21] of the other so you need to get it in
[29:22] line and not say the devil can do this
[29:25] and the devil can do that remember the
[29:27] devil cannot create alright so he said
[29:32] all souls are mine as the soul of the
[29:35] father so also the soul of the son is
[29:38] mine the soul that's in the
[29:40] it's he'll die you may be seated Lord at
[29:44] his blessing to the reading of the word
[29:46] got to have brother Raphael and his wife
[29:51] with us always call him Pancho I never
[29:55] could remember his name I'm barely
[29:56] getting it in Raphael
[29:58] I hope it's getting close anyway so at
[30:01] least he knows who he is but now we were
[30:06] trying to I wanted to try to back up a
[30:10] little bit and then move on into the
[30:12] thought for this afternoon but what was
[30:15] our thought this morning trying for
[30:20] quite a while to get you to see that
[30:24] just because you say you have quotes for
[30:27] things and all this that and the other
[30:29] those you got scriptures if it doesn't
[30:32] line up Illustrated this morning that
[30:36] and I love that thought that the Prophet
[30:38] said ever prophet in the Bible had to
[30:43] line up his thoughts with the prophets
[30:47] before him now isn't that something that
[30:50] we could take a book of 66 books you
[30:53] know how many authors and all that we
[30:57] could take and it line up and make a
[30:59] beautiful perfect Word of God
[31:03] well the but brother Dale there's
[31:05] contradictions here well I want you to
[31:06] show me one I've said that before and I
[31:09] want to see it I'd like to find the
[31:12] contradictions you know but see it's not
[31:15] dark because if you line up everyone
[31:17] with the other one then there's no way
[31:21] that that Moses could describe God but
[31:26] then Abraham described a different God
[31:29] right you get the point that all of it
[31:33] must line up then if we believe that
[31:36] we're in the end time and the life's
[31:38] profit to the Gentile dispensation has
[31:41] come and brought his message then it
[31:43] would have to line up ever scripture we
[31:47] have to line up to that message and
[31:50] bring out the same God that each prophet
[31:53] prior
[31:54] to him was trying to bring out and bring
[31:58] it into view to where we could
[32:00] understand to me that makes the Word of
[32:02] God being perfect now let's see what is
[32:07] the word we have the perfect
[32:11] interpretation by divine vindication is
[32:14] that the wording I believe that is true
[32:17] perfect vindication you know in other
[32:19] words God came down in the last days and
[32:21] vindicated the prophets message to be
[32:24] right that's what you say well why do
[32:27] you read a King James Version I have
[32:30] other versions I of all kind I've got
[32:32] one books got 26 translations in it you
[32:36] know covering all of the Bibles and the
[32:38] thing that's been written but I still
[32:40] read this but I'll go back and check
[32:42] things on the others to make sure they
[32:45] all line up to see what they're bringing
[32:48] let's see this King James Version is the
[32:53] one the Prophet read from and it was
[32:56] vindicated so I don't need other
[32:57] versions and other ideas yet I read them
[33:01] but I don't need them because I believe
[33:04] it now you say what are you you got the
[33:06] King guy you believe that's perfect I
[33:07] believe this is perfect this can be your
[33:11] prophet said it was right even that the
[33:13] engine in the bus was in the right place
[33:15] so that's pretty good tops huh yeah but
[33:20] you just think you're just too much sold
[33:21] I don't know brand amount well it might
[33:24] be it may be to that point but I'm sold
[33:28] out on one time I'm sold out on the Word
[33:31] of God it's right and as we're trying to
[33:34] illustrate this morning we used to think
[33:38] Matthew 28:19 contradicted acts 2:38 he
[33:44] becomes you know well then we come up
[33:47] with the greater thoughts and we thought
[33:50] we had it figured out and we came up
[33:53] with the ideas well that that's that's
[33:55] so that's good but so that I've heard
[33:58] people say it this way said the
[34:01] denomination to take Matthew 28:19
[34:05] that said we take no acts 2:38 no I
[34:10] don't agree with that if we're
[34:14] denominations to Matthew 28:19 they
[34:19] would have to get baptized in the name
[34:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ you're greedy
[34:23] because that's what it say it it's not
[34:25] saying two things all right it's saying
[34:31] one thing but it takes two understanding
[34:36] or two thoughts to come together to
[34:38] understand that all right
[34:42] talking this morning worth it
[34:47] Jesus said in John there he said you
[34:52] haven't chosen me but I chose you and
[34:58] ordained you to go forth no no none
[35:04] watch what he said he said you didn't
[35:06] choose me he said I chose you and
[35:12] ordained you but then we go over to Paul
[35:16] in Ephesians and Paul said that we were
[35:22] chosen in him before the foundation of
[35:27] the world now is that a contradiction we
[35:34] were chosen in him before the foundation
[35:36] world when he turned around and said you
[35:38] didn't choose me I chose you well did he
[35:42] choose us like picking out I'll take
[35:46] this one
[35:46] I won't take this one for some reason
[35:49] has he picked you no no no we don't
[35:53] believe that way we don't believe that
[35:56] he was picking and choosing well the way
[36:00] it sounds that he said right he said I
[36:05] chose you you see what I'm trying to get
[36:08] you to see was this morning Paul had the
[36:12] revelation of what Jesus said
[36:17] jesus said you didn't choose me I chose
[36:23] you the Paul comes along and said we
[36:31] were chosen in him it didn't Paul
[36:34] doesn't say we were chosen by him he
[36:37] said we were chosen in him before the
[36:40] foundation of the world
[36:42] well he's that contradictory or is it
[36:46] the truth huh see then I tried to bring
[36:53] it to a point and I'll bring this and
[36:55] then move on so then did did God in the
[37:02] beginning before anything did he choose
[37:07] you he said yeah he chokes me did he why
[37:19] did he choose him what was the way that
[37:23] he used to make the point right and
[37:28] that's what I'm saying then what's the
[37:30] point the point that will not be
[37:32] contrary nowhere in the Word of God
[37:34] because this contrary one is not
[37:37] comparing to the other you get the
[37:41] reason that leg the background with a
[37:42] prophets had to line it all up you can't
[37:46] say acts 2:38 is contrary to Matthew
[37:50] 28:19 you've got to say they're saying
[37:54] the same thing so that it can't be then
[38:02] watch the point it's not correct in
[38:04] scripture its correcting our ideas when
[38:08] are we gonna get to the point I've been
[38:14] around the wild and faced a lot in this
[38:17] message but I want you to think just a
[38:21] minute
[38:23] the people of this message are the worst
[38:26] mixed-up people that they are anymore
[38:31] ain't no Baptist shirts messed up like
[38:34] the people of this nation I don't mind
[38:39] saying that cuz you got all these
[38:42] doctrines and ideas from one message
[38:46] what do you mean in that the message
[38:49] brings a whole lot of thoughts and ideas
[38:51] they weaken each one take her own then
[38:55] it cannot be comparing with the rest of
[38:57] the Word of God
[38:59] mehran so then they must be something
[39:04] wrong with the thoughts and the ideas if
[39:08] they don't all come out to bring forth
[39:10] the one understanding then that's not
[39:13] the gospel the prophet brought that's
[39:19] that's just me you know that's the way I
[39:21] see things I see the Word of God is
[39:24] perfect in an order and why can't we get
[39:28] the basis of saying what the word says
[39:32] without trying to figure it out that's
[39:40] my whole point why do we have to figure
[39:46] out like I know he said that but I think
[39:55] that's why you've gotten fifteen or
[39:59] eighteen hundred different denominations
[40:00] today used to be 969 now it's probably
[40:03] two or three times that in about 2000 in
[40:06] this message because they're still
[40:09] trying to figure out what's saying
[40:11] instead of reading what the Prophet says
[40:14] and believe in it yeah waiting for the
[40:20] Holy Spirit to reveal it right but
[40:24] believing it and said thank you
[40:31] see we don't have no problem with the
[40:35] world out here you pick up a newspaper
[40:39] and people to read it and see one you're
[40:43] gonna emphasize a little more on one
[40:44] point or the other but if everybody in
[40:46] you read a newspaper today or one
[40:48] message part you would have basically
[40:51] the same thoughts but how come it is so
[40:55] many people can read the Bible and
[40:57] everybody's got a different thought and
[41:03] then they got the little comeback you
[41:06] know that's your way of seeing this is
[41:12] the way I see it but when that been
[41:16] something wouldn't it have been
[41:18] something for John the Baptist just
[41:20] stepped out to her
[41:21] we know his job was to introduce the
[41:23] Messiah right no we know the Old
[41:29] Testament I'm quoting brother Branham
[41:32] right the Old Testament gave birth those
[41:37] prophets built the body of Jesus Christ
[41:40] when he stood over there in Hebrews 10 5
[41:43] that a body dies for father
[41:45] I mean it was those prophets words take
[41:49] out one of the prophets you would have
[41:52] had an incomplete body of Jesus Christ
[41:55] standing on earth am i quoting brother
[42:01] Brad I mean he said the prophets built
[42:03] the body and he said John come to be the
[42:07] head of that point to introduce the head
[42:10] we know but he was a head at that point
[42:14] well what if he to introduce Caiaphas
[42:21] do you follow him I thought I'm just
[42:23] trying to make a carnal talk to you to
[42:27] hit a spiritual revelation the Bible's
[42:32] not written that away it's written to
[42:36] bring forth the revelation the one true
[42:38] and living God
[42:41] many many authors but all of them
[42:46] completely compare to each other then
[42:53] you have a message brought to us in the
[42:58] in town that was supposed to who my
[43:01] understanding of what he said it was to
[43:04] pick up all the loose ends right and put
[43:09] it all together and then bring the
[43:12] revelation to take us to the change of
[43:14] the body that's what I thought was the
[43:18] message but that way said it don't give
[43:23] us each one some doubt of her own well
[43:27] that's the way you see it I see it this
[43:28] way a man if they no contradiction to
[43:31] that but I've always made this statement
[43:35] and me remembers it
[43:36] you can't start out in Genesis with a
[43:38] white dog anybody won't finish that one
[43:43] most who would know the answer right
[43:45] brother colleagues were in and he'd
[43:46] probably tell you you can't start out
[43:48] with a white dog in Genesis and you wind
[43:51] up in Revelations with a black dog you
[43:56] changed some work it wouldn't even be
[43:59] that you could wind up in the book of
[44:01] Revelation with a black and white dog
[44:05] you've missed it some work see that's
[44:09] what I see about the message the people
[44:13] are missing well you just think you've
[44:15] got the answer no I don't think I'll
[44:18] have all the answers but there's one
[44:21] thing about it I know where the book is
[44:23] I know what the Prophet says about it so
[44:30] then why not just stay with that part
[44:31] like that and just believe that until it
[44:34] comes forth I was expressing want to go
[44:36] to a brother see when you see something
[44:41] then it opens and it'll stop opening are
[44:49] you with me
[44:50] you see things elope up and it'll just
[44:53] stop well don't get all excited and go
[44:58] haywire try to find you another book or
[45:02] another prophet just wait and just keep
[45:11] studying right there where you're at you
[45:15] already seen my old Daniel 70 weeks book
[45:17] Hey
[45:19] and come out I'd put it a line on it I
[45:22] put a question mark that meant I didn't
[45:26] understand that meant something cut off
[45:29] well then I'd go back and read it again
[45:32] maybe a year later you know mark out
[45:37] that question mark because I could see
[45:40] it I would never preach on the 70 weeks
[45:44] of Daniel that's why I stand today with
[45:46] it maybe you out there whatever you do
[45:49] come show me what's wrong what I've
[45:54] tried to teach you on it I'm saying open
[45:56] as you see I would never preach it
[45:59] deliver mark was out why because I knew
[46:04] if there's a question things are not
[46:07] right you got a question about something
[46:13] you can't be settled so you got to wait
[46:17] until it's revealed but once it's
[46:20] revealed you don't worry about nothing
[46:24] well because it's up to him
[46:27] all right trying to explain one God till
[46:34] trying to preach on one God after 50
[46:37] years but seeing it open more every day
[46:41] as we travel alone I could go back with
[46:47] you through the messages for 40 years
[46:50] and show you where he's just been a
[46:51] constant unfolding yeah I'll show you
[46:56] where it would stop and then where to
[46:58] start again well because it's the Word
[47:00] of God all right
[47:03] I don't mind telling you I don't have
[47:06] the answers to everything but I did kind
[47:11] of kind of phrase years ago brother
[47:13] Larry can well remember this in the old
[47:15] days and learn the sixties you know in
[47:18] early seventies and they'd say beware of
[47:24] him that's got all the answers yeah he's
[47:33] smart he's intellect so I said ok you
[47:38] calling that phrase Alcon this one we
[47:41] were on the feller that don't have any
[47:42] answers could I fear him more if you
[47:48] don't have any answers I fear him a
[47:50] whole lot more they not do with all
[47:52] these ideas at least he's moving in
[47:55] doing something all right see then that
[47:59] leaves that to worry you can follow it
[48:01] and understand toward us say in this
[48:05] morning we talked about picking and
[48:11] choosing and we get it all messed up
[48:12] but did you catch the thought I was
[48:14] bringing this morning then we'll
[48:15] continue him you know that God didn't
[48:20] choose you he did if he chose you want
[48:29] to choose he I mean you're on the other
[48:33] end of it right
[48:34] if he chose you tell me why I chose you
[48:41] he said yeah because I know this I know
[48:44] Paul said you can know all the mysteries
[48:48] and he'll not charity
[48:50] you're a sound and Bryce and the
[48:53] tinkling cymbal is that right so if
[48:58] you're gonna say God chose me give me
[49:00] the reason he chose you but yet you got
[49:03] scripture said you didn't choose me I
[49:05] told you but did he choose you
[49:17] did you choose your children did you
[49:27] choose your children you know where
[49:31] today when you can do that you've got
[49:35] your your way of putting the eggs and
[49:37] sperm two things together we're in the
[49:39] days when you can actually choose but
[49:42] you still got a problem because even
[49:45] with that and just scientifically saying
[49:48] it it's not just one per one that you
[49:52] implant to try to get it's a mini player
[49:54] one or twos or threes you said what are
[49:59] you talking about you never chose your
[50:02] children you could take a DNA and prove
[50:06] who they belong to which you never chose
[50:08] them you had them God never chose you if
[50:18] you have eternal life he never chose you
[50:22] you are him
[50:32] we gave him this morning we run around
[50:35] and says that we were a part of God well
[50:42] then what does it mean to be a part of
[50:43] God you see where scripture gets
[50:48] involved and you could go six months
[50:50] this rolling I can write now in
[50:52] Scripture you realize from what I was
[50:55] saying this morning that God never chose
[50:58] you
[50:58] he didn't have to choose you were his
[51:00] child if you have eternal life you're
[51:05] part of him is that simple if you have
[51:10] eternal life the eternal life was part
[51:12] of him then did he choose you did he
[51:18] have laid out before him a great
[51:20] multitude of people and he could choose
[51:24] one
[51:26] no that's why I like what Paul said all
[51:29] doesn't go contrary Paul said we were
[51:34] chosen in him before the foundation of
[51:40] the world all is that scripture Paul was
[51:43] explaining what Jesus said but putting
[51:46] it in a revelation where you could
[51:49] understand God never set up before the
[51:52] world and said there's a whole bunch of
[51:54] people I'll pick me a few here I'll bet
[51:55] no it's where Paul Don Marzio said we
[52:04] are his offspring you remain you realize
[52:09] that God's children or a part of him
[52:15] he's not that God had a son that didn't
[52:21] even write to come forth with Jesus
[52:22] Christ God never had a son he was the
[52:27] son he became the son Jesus is not a son
[52:37] of God as a separate person is he he's
[52:43] the same person in another form simple
[52:49] language right so then did God choose
[52:53] you or was you chosen in him if he's
[52:59] chosen in him then now I say it over and
[53:02] over cuz I want it straight in the tunel
[53:04] life you have right now by the new birth
[53:07] was a part of God before the world just
[53:10] as eternal as God he is in brother
[53:15] Branham said what God is not complete
[53:19] without you hey brother sales must be
[53:28] getting something new started I've been
[53:31] teaching this 47 years
[53:34] trying to get somebody to believe it
[53:40] still trying to figure out all this I
[53:42] always was eternal one way and say that
[53:44] one ain't worried about it I'm concerned
[53:50] we're trying to see one time if I can
[53:54] find it in God's Word I don't have to
[53:55] worry about anything else we see we look
[54:00] at the fact and we try to figure out
[54:02] they here's God and here's the Sun and
[54:05] here's a Holy Spirit we had that Great
[54:10] Trinity figured out didn't we
[54:12] we'll come find out it didn't work all
[54:18] God was he poured into Christ right did
[54:27] that do away with God did that leave him
[54:31] any less God no he just changed his form
[54:35] and moved over into as we called it a
[54:38] son getting this ready for next week
[54:42] maybe or you could call him a son is the
[54:47] Holy Ghost another person or is he the
[54:49] same God made manifest in another form
[54:53] well if God is in you who are you he
[55:02] said we don't take scriptures in think
[55:06] when Jesus at his resurrection Jesus in
[55:14] his resurrection he made an outstanding
[55:17] statement he said I go to my father and
[55:27] your father he said I go to my god and
[55:34] your God
[55:43] that sounds like to me that he's trying
[55:45] to explain that we're the children of
[55:49] God by being the children of God then
[55:57] him being in us is what makes us a child
[56:03] him being in us and what makes us a
[56:05] child okay and if you ever was a part of
[56:14] God you always will be the part of God
[56:18] the reasoning use parties because none
[56:20] of us can have it in its fullness right
[56:24] but now if the Godhead and all is not if
[56:27] God's not complete without us then you
[56:29] have to put all of us together to make
[56:30] him complete right and as I said if you
[56:36] left one prophet out of the Old
[56:37] Testament Oh child you have an
[56:42] incomplete body if you leave one person
[56:48] who's a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[56:52] if one person left out you've got an
[56:55] incomplete body trying to express
[56:59] something
[57:08] god I'm trying to get you to see
[57:15] something I've preached for months and
[57:16] months okay see he was kind of hard back
[57:23] there a few months ago you remember
[57:24] somebody don't when I was trying to
[57:28] express before the eternal but brother
[57:32] Brennan said in the beginning before the
[57:33] eternal and how that God was and what
[57:36] was all do you ask most people say well
[57:41] what was God before any of all this well
[57:43] he's just a spirit he was just floating
[57:45] around he just just a floating right
[57:48] according to the Prophet he never was
[57:50] just a spirit by the way he said he's a
[57:53] being he's a person so before the world
[57:56] ever begun he stood there as a person
[58:00] the person yeah but I just can't see him
[58:08] as being real back there how come why
[58:10] what's the purpose you mean to tell me
[58:14] that what whoever whatever that is that
[58:17] he was is not greater than we are come
[58:21] on that's pretty hard in it but you know
[58:27] something had to bring that into being
[58:31] I'm trying to get you to a point maybe
[58:34] that you might see according to Joel
[58:40] where were you in the morning stars sang
[58:42] together the sons of God shouted for joy
[58:45] its back before the foundation of the
[58:47] world
[58:55] let me say it this way and then let's
[58:58] see if you follow it then there was
[59:00] never a time that God dwelt alone oh
[59:06] yeah I believe it no you're not getting
[59:11] the point there's never a time that he
[59:17] dwelt alone because the always had his
[59:22] attributes if you have eternal life you
[59:27] was back there before this world ever
[59:29] started and if you don't have eternal
[59:33] life he wasn't back there solved the
[59:36] problem but if you have eternal life
[59:39] eternal life you have what's before the
[59:41] world see we're just looking at life
[59:46] we're not looking at as I said that
[59:50] Jesus would say I go to my father in
[59:53] your father we're not looking at the
[59:59] scripture that says there were errors no
[1:00:04] errors ACRs eres billing my southern
[1:00:07] parts bad on them hairs and join errors
[1:00:16] soon heirs with Jesus Christ and
[1:00:20] Almighty God at the same time they were
[1:00:23] joint iron where heirs of God and joint
[1:00:26] iron I thought joint irons meant
[1:00:30] everybody had the same thing all
[1:00:31] together as one
[1:00:32] I thought the body of Christ everybody
[1:00:34] was one body we never existed back there
[1:00:42] is some kind of little people running
[1:00:44] around that's y'all witnesses and things
[1:00:46] like that but we have established one
[1:00:51] thing for certain at least four enough
[1:00:53] for me to know if you have eternal life
[1:00:56] today you had any ternal life then I
[1:00:59] solved with me that's you can argue the
[1:01:02] point and if you were a part of God
[1:01:10] then you know what how long was it
[1:01:15] taking place in eternity and we proved
[1:01:19] by your profit there's when the morning
[1:01:22] stars sang together sons of God shouted
[1:01:23] for joy that that was back in eternity
[1:01:29] we proved by the Prophet that the book
[1:01:32] of the life of the lamb slain before the
[1:01:34] foundation of the world was written
[1:01:36] before the world back in eternity we
[1:01:41] think was written after we got here he
[1:01:47] said well how can you prove it because
[1:01:48] of what your prophets then he said when
[1:01:51] those morning stars sang together sons
[1:01:53] of God shouted for joy he said could it
[1:01:57] have been when the book of life come
[1:01:59] into view he said they saw the plan of
[1:02:04] salvation but you don't remember it
[1:02:10] right there's no way for us to remember
[1:02:13] it because it was removed from I
[1:02:15] remember sister but you will you agree
[1:02:18] to this point anybody that ever I guess
[1:02:20] eternal life as a child of God had to be
[1:02:24] a part of gone back to her will you
[1:02:25] agree that way I mean see that if you
[1:02:29] agree that way you can see that it never
[1:02:33] was a time that we look at God as he
[1:02:36] just nothing he's just walking around
[1:02:43] ain't got no might talk to you got a
[1:02:47] mighty fellowship with see that's why I
[1:02:50] love the word when are we gonna read the
[1:02:51] word and get it right in the morning
[1:02:55] start saying to get her sons of God
[1:02:57] shouted for joy that tells you before
[1:03:00] this world ever begun that God had his
[1:03:07] plan and his purpose and he was going to
[1:03:12] have a family and watch what I'm saying
[1:03:15] he wasn't going to have a family those
[1:03:19] terms said get us in their own
[1:03:21] he had a family can I quote the Prophet
[1:03:26] he said he was self-existing 1d say that
[1:03:28] what he said he dwelt alone with his
[1:03:30] thoughts
[1:03:33] he said what are you his thoughts
[1:03:37] brother Dale everybody else is over here
[1:03:40] trying to tell us how good we are and
[1:03:42] how we need this now we need to add and
[1:03:45] you're back talking before the world
[1:03:47] well put me in the category at least
[1:03:50] with the old black brother right you
[1:03:53] remember him when run around first run
[1:03:55] into it he's in everybody else for the
[1:03:57] priest you know what happening on earth
[1:03:59] he said he got the old man up during the
[1:04:01] old coat you know it said my lord why do
[1:04:03] you putting that guy by far he too old
[1:04:07] he said they would tell him to what
[1:04:09] happened on earth he said here was as
[1:04:11] men he said he got up fire and said he
[1:04:15] said where were you or for two mornings
[1:04:17] huh
[1:04:18] he said he said you ain't got enough
[1:04:20] room up here for me to preach city
[1:04:22] holler with me he said he brought him
[1:04:27] down the horizontal rainbow now I didn't
[1:04:32] know there was one did you but brother
[1:04:34] branham talked about it he enjoyed it
[1:04:36] well why can't I enjoy but that man saw
[1:04:40] something and a prophet rejoicing as to
[1:04:47] what the man was seeing God he saw it
[1:04:53] see we want to make him God as he
[1:04:55] nothing and all and then finally he
[1:04:58] starts coming down before he ever
[1:05:00] started coming this way
[1:05:02] he was a whole lot more than we are
[1:05:04] after we got here so don't worry about
[1:05:06] it simply trying to get you to see one
[1:05:11] God so then was it a choosing part or
[1:05:17] was it the fact that he already had his
[1:05:19] children all he had to do was wait for a
[1:05:23] time he could display him on earth any
[1:05:27] problems with that okay
[1:05:30] now I won't have time to finish the
[1:05:33] message but I'll started
[1:05:35] yeah what were we before the world
[1:05:45] what were we when a prophet would say in
[1:05:49] the beginning but before the eternal
[1:05:54] there's no way to comprehend that
[1:05:56] statement you gotta just believe it that
[1:05:58] there was some way that prophet I love
[1:06:03] it like this lettering said I went to
[1:06:06] the first heaven right he said Paul went
[1:06:11] to the third heaven and said Paul the
[1:06:14] America scripture said he said he saw
[1:06:17] things he could not speak about Sarah he
[1:06:27] saw things he couldn't speak about he
[1:06:29] says not even lawful for me you know
[1:06:32] now here's me okay I'll just putting my
[1:06:34] appointment right here okay its mother
[1:06:36] Dale see there wasn't nobody that I
[1:06:39] could understand what Paul was talking
[1:06:40] about you know they said about Einstein
[1:06:45] they said he had one buddy that could
[1:06:49] really follow him he said he was an old
[1:06:52] drunk and hung around with it and the
[1:06:55] Hans town could communicate with an old
[1:06:58] drunk with all the rest of the
[1:06:59] scientists and everything else you know
[1:07:06] what he wound up and split the atom you
[1:07:10] know what he done what the rest of them
[1:07:12] couldn't do the run said I would love to
[1:07:18] been there to talk to him when he was
[1:07:20] talking about his finite universe
[1:07:22] remember that is it what finite or
[1:07:25] infinite ever each one of the words of
[1:07:26] you Einstein said you stand and look out
[1:07:30] and he said with unlimited vision
[1:07:33] nothing to limit your vision
[1:07:35] he said you look straight out he said
[1:07:37] what would you see he said the back of
[1:07:39] your head
[1:07:46] unlimited now see the back here head
[1:07:52] what I love about I understand I'm not a
[1:07:57] mathematician but I always loved math
[1:08:01] Einstein's theories were mathematical
[1:08:04] calculations he put it into action
[1:08:12] he said in space he said her part he
[1:08:16] said you could shoot one object to the
[1:08:18] other object in the fourth dimension and
[1:08:22] he said he'd go through so fast
[1:08:24] he'd never leave a hole you want to
[1:08:27] quote from brother branham there where
[1:08:30] he said Jesus came back so fast when he
[1:08:33] was returning to the disciples he said
[1:08:35] he come back so fast he went right
[1:08:37] through the wall he never left I
[1:08:42] understand you a lot he said I'd love to
[1:08:45] talk to you about those time listen
[1:08:49] church and as I thought this for a few
[1:08:52] minutes and then I'll finish it but will
[1:08:55] in Sunday and you have questions we're a
[1:08:59] human being to be a human being the fact
[1:09:03] is that we're not like the animals you
[1:09:07] know the other animals were created a
[1:09:08] body and a life spirit whatever you want
[1:09:11] to call it you know what the human being
[1:09:14] was created in the image of God I love
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:17] and by created in the image of God
[1:09:20] according to Genesis 1:26 or 27 all
[1:09:24] right we're we have a body a spirit and
[1:09:28] a soul that makes us a human being the
[1:09:35] animal just has the body the spirit part
[1:09:38] that's why he doesn't change the bird
[1:09:40] builds a house the same he does
[1:09:42] everything it doesn't change but the
[1:09:47] human being this wrote around him said
[1:09:50] even in his fallen estate and got it
[1:09:52] laying in here a minute I'll get it he
[1:09:55] said even in his fault in the state
[1:09:57] that man is a marvelous creation even in
[1:10:05] his fallen estate look at the science
[1:10:11] that you're dealing with today you've
[1:10:17] got a little overwatch on your own you
[1:10:23] know what there's computers right
[1:10:29] computer on that little watch ain't
[1:10:32] talked about my watch I'm talking about
[1:10:33] you I'm talking about you can get them
[1:10:36] watch the computers the size of a watch
[1:10:39] you see we think we don't listen I love
[1:10:45] to read I left to read all documentaries
[1:10:50] or whatever you want to call them you
[1:10:55] know I read one time in the year 1900
[1:11:00] they had watches now you can
[1:11:06] automatically blow your mind because
[1:11:08] you're gonna think that the only watch
[1:11:10] they had you know was these big old time
[1:11:15] clocks and big old kinds because the
[1:11:18] watch didn't come on until later on as
[1:11:20] we come and that thinking about it that
[1:11:29] little computer can be compressed into
[1:11:31] that size and then you think about
[1:11:35] cameras and pictures in 1900 we still
[1:11:40] looked at pull over the time get you
[1:11:42] lined up you know lit up the thing right
[1:11:48] the government had watches in 1900 that
[1:11:56] could take pictures of you
[1:12:03] I don't know where I believe that or not
[1:12:07] well that's alright don't matter that's
[1:12:11] just making a point
[1:12:14] some of you are in owning steady things
[1:12:17] in living you know yourself you military
[1:12:20] people that anything they tell you your
[1:12:23] god is obsolete they are not going to
[1:12:26] tell you you don't read and listen when
[1:12:32] they went to Kuwait two months or
[1:12:35] something before they win they tried to
[1:12:37] get a stealth bomber built they had to
[1:12:41] photo tops made of stealth bombers to
[1:12:47] take them into Kuwait two months they
[1:12:51] told that to the head down the first
[1:12:55] trip they made to Kuwait you better
[1:12:57] check it they had 15 you know evidently
[1:13:02] they didn't tell us all of it you don't
[1:13:06] never listen to your prophet say and his
[1:13:09] fifty son 1950 something he said Russia
[1:13:13] has jet our planes we see most of you
[1:13:20] that know your history
[1:13:22] the Germans and things had jets before
[1:13:25] we did they just didn't know how to
[1:13:29] handle it brother Ron said they say
[1:13:32] Russia
[1:13:33] he's got yet our plane and watch him and
[1:13:36] flying saucers
[1:13:41] that's what's your prophecy
[1:13:47] but we didn't know about flying saucers
[1:13:50] the first one you check I was about 40
[1:13:52] 1940 right in there when that poster of
[1:13:55] Christ and most immense in outer space
[1:13:57] and all that thing you know that big old
[1:14:00] place I turned now they still won't let
[1:14:01] nobody go - what are you getting at I'm
[1:14:05] getting at one thing if science has
[1:14:08] advanced as much as it has what do you
[1:14:12] think they're doing brother Branham says
[1:14:14] they're breaking into God's laboratory
[1:14:17] it's unbelievable all right go back to
[1:14:20] Genesis an imagination of man's heart
[1:14:22] was continually evil in other words
[1:14:24] there was nothing that a man thought
[1:14:25] ever he couldn't do it that's in Genesis
[1:14:30] before the flood they told him it
[1:14:32] wouldn't go in rain no they could shoot
[1:14:35] the Stars and back and prove it but he
[1:14:39] did now getting a point when are we
[1:14:46] gonna believe what the Prophet say it
[1:14:52] without trying to figure it out but just
[1:14:57] believe it and accept him as being the
[1:15:02] Prophet and telling us what the Bible
[1:15:04] says it's all right brother Branham I
[1:15:10] like that I like to I like to ask
[1:15:13] brother Brennan questions page 45 I
[1:15:16] think it is Christ the mystery of God
[1:15:19] revealed letter Branham what is the new
[1:15:22] birth he says it there the very wording
[1:15:27] what is the new birth so he's gonna
[1:15:30] answer it he said it's a revelation of
[1:15:32] Jesus Christ
[1:15:34] personally to you not you join the
[1:15:39] church in Atlanta it's a revelation of
[1:15:40] Jesus Christ personally to you well see
[1:15:42] I like to ask brother Branham question
[1:15:45] brother Branham from year 63 on through
[1:15:51] 65 you spend a lot of time talking about
[1:15:55] eternal life
[1:15:57] every message he's talking about eternal
[1:16:00] life every message he's talking about a
[1:16:02] seed being in you he's saying you always
[1:16:08] was eternal you weren't born on any
[1:16:12] certain day how can that be
[1:16:19] truth letter random what were we then
[1:16:25] before the world we said we were part of
[1:16:33] God you've spent a lot of time right
[1:16:35] I'm glad you remember that we spent a
[1:16:37] lot of time trying to explain that right
[1:16:38] they were part of God all right now what
[1:16:42] part of God do we need to talk about now
[1:16:50] according to your prophet
[1:16:52] God is a triune being not a Trinity a
[1:16:57] triune being and as it makes takes
[1:17:01] Father Son and Holy Ghost to make you a
[1:17:03] person it takes Father Son and Holy
[1:17:08] Ghost to make God a person leave off any
[1:17:15] one of them he's not a person
[1:17:16] leave off body you're not complete leave
[1:17:19] off souls or spirits you're not complete
[1:17:22] what she didn't that's why we don't have
[1:17:26] no problem sin and Paul Paul wrote sit
[1:17:31] one God man we get one day he said the
[1:17:35] God and Father God and father of our
[1:17:39] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:46] that's five manifestations
[1:17:52] right God father of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:57] Christ you said well you got four words
[1:17:59] okay we got forward that's enough you
[1:18:01] know you know what's Paul ever talking
[1:18:06] about a Trinity he didn't believe in it
[1:18:09] did he he was the guy that was real good
[1:18:12] instrumental in doing away with it did
[1:18:16] brother Branham ever believe in the
[1:18:17] Trinity how would you like a quote where
[1:18:21] he said let's stand together and address
[1:18:22] a third person of the Trinity the direct
[1:18:27] quote was he ever a Trinity of anyway
[1:18:33] Danny no no we never treated him well
[1:18:39] why would he do that cuz he talking
[1:18:41] about your person you're not done by
[1:18:42] himself he knew he believed he said
[1:18:46] let's address your person you won't
[1:18:48] address the second or third person of
[1:18:50] the Trinity and let's talk about him a
[1:18:51] little bit he was never a Trinitarian he
[1:18:56] was right till we go to him and say
[1:19:00] brother branham we've concluded by your
[1:19:07] statements that if there's any way we
[1:19:11] could be back dire we would have to be a
[1:19:13] part of God if we have eternal life it
[1:19:21] means that eternal life that you have is
[1:19:23] a part of God
[1:19:32] what about it what part of God are we
[1:19:38] what part of God was before the
[1:19:41] foundation of the world that we are a
[1:19:43] part of to make us to make heaven comes
[1:19:45] with it
[1:19:54] so let's read him in city go ahead
[1:19:57] brothers pick up number one we'll get
[1:19:59] started
[1:19:59] I'll just go so far and quit try to get
[1:20:03] the point to you this is from the
[1:20:06] message the God who is rich in mercy
[1:20:11] I got 44 or 45 45 46 now listen to what
[1:20:17] he says and I love it I'm only saying
[1:20:22] this not to mix up doctrine but to
[1:20:28] straighten it out you don't have to mix
[1:20:33] up doctrine it comes already mixed right
[1:20:41] my wife says get self-rising I was
[1:20:45] thinking what the difference in
[1:20:46] self-rising and in the regular kind
[1:20:52] which he explained one day that
[1:20:54] self-rising meant there was something in
[1:20:56] it to make it rise well you know I
[1:20:59] understand that night on so you don't

[1:21:26] fear and scare deer and scare what are
[1:21:35] you afraid of
[1:21:42] the biggest fear of human element can

[1:21:58] languages none there at least that ought
[1:22:00] to be the biggest fear the biggest fear
[1:22:03] that we could ever have or to be are we
[1:22:05] born again or not and to see it line up
[1:22:11] in the correct way you'll see he takes
[1:22:14] away that fear and he shows you who you
[1:22:17] are get away from this fear and scare

[1:23:09] you are if you knew who you are you
[1:23:12] wouldn't be afraid now look you are not
[1:23:20] going to be but now you are the sons of
[1:23:25] God you always were the sons of God
[1:23:40] you don't need to bring these things out
[1:23:42] call it skiers us okay you catch my
[1:23:47] point it scares us go we need an answer
[1:23:54] I wasn't afraid before now the Prophet
[1:23:59] told me I don't know who I am and he
[1:24:06] says but you are the sons of God you
[1:24:10] always were the sons of God now isolate
[1:24:17] that what do you got you got you coming
[1:24:25] in the world with eternal life
[1:24:27] you got your thoughts that I don't have
[1:24:29] to worry about a thing cause always was
[1:24:30] he turned but when you read then and the
[1:24:37] Prophet will say you begin eternal life
[1:24:40] right here to alter don't you tell me I
[1:24:44] will not even entertain the thought that
[1:24:46] you don't fall back on but I thought
[1:24:52] always was now he's saying I'll get it
[1:24:56] down here don't tell me you don't do
[1:24:59] that I'm a human and do the same thing
[1:25:02] okay
[1:25:03] listen how is it that you always were
[1:25:08] son of God
[1:25:15] but the fact that you have a life of
[1:25:20] Almighty God living within you right now
[1:25:26] that way you always were a son of God if
[1:25:33] you're a part of God and that part of
[1:25:38] God is eternal life you always was a son
[1:25:46] you just blowing my mind
[1:25:49] why wouldn't you want to find out a few
[1:25:52] answers then are you satisfied with your
[1:25:56] mind going blown and forget it
[1:25:58] help yourself look you always were sons
[1:26:03] of God if you're a part of God and was
[1:26:09] back there you're a son of God if you
[1:26:13] don't have the new birth
[1:26:14] you wouldn't back that so you're not a
[1:26:17] son of God see everybody is the son of
[1:26:19] God by creation right by physical
[1:26:23] creation of mankind ever person in the
[1:26:26] world is the son of God it's not a son
[1:26:29] of the devil didn't create the only way
[1:26:33] a human being can be and to come into
[1:26:36] being is a fact that God created you
[1:26:40] they don't matter whether you ever get
[1:26:42] saved or not you were a son of God by
[1:26:46] natural creation we've got to get the
[1:26:52] spiritual part run look for when God had
[1:26:56] you in his thinking at the beginning you
[1:27:02] have to be some part of you I didn't
[1:27:08] make up the word him some part of you
[1:27:12] your life that's in you now had to be
[1:27:17] with God before there you know what old
[1:27:22] man well when he before he even become
[1:27:28] my
[1:27:29] Tyrael here on earth before there was
[1:27:32] anything but God you were one of his
[1:27:35] attributes
[1:27:35] he knows what your name would be he
[1:27:39] knowed the color of your higher you
[1:27:41] would have you know all about you
[1:27:44] the only thing happened this wind your
[1:27:46] your being a sinner you come into the
[1:27:48] world are you reading them some part of
[1:27:53] you if you're going to read what I don't
[1:27:57] believe that would then you're saying
[1:27:58] you don't live what'd he say it right so
[1:28:03] just go ahead and play it's not but if
[1:28:07] you listen to what he said he said some
[1:28:12] part of you what part of you
[1:28:23] look you're next
[1:28:29] this is who is this Melchizedek he's
[1:28:33] talking about in this thinking before
[1:28:34] there was an angel stars arab emirate
[1:28:36] anything that's eternal and if you have
[1:28:39] eternal life you always was and wants
[1:28:43] you not your being here but to shape and
[1:28:48] form of the infinite god who is not our
[1:28:53] being here get all this out of the way
[1:28:59] it's to shape and form of the infinite
[1:29:02] God because he's the only one that ever
[1:29:05] was he time look at number three
[1:29:10] questions and answers on Genesis now the
[1:29:15] first man he made the first man in His
[1:29:18] image and we're returning back to that
[1:29:22] image
[1:29:23] that's right to our first created image
[1:29:32] then is what he said when God created me
[1:29:40] William Branham I was before the
[1:29:43] foundation of the world like I said we
[1:29:52] brother Branham yea we believe brother
[1:29:54] Brandon four to five days work but when
[1:29:56] he gets down here to arm and Neville and
[1:29:58] the rest of us are we gonna believe that
[1:30:00] I believe brother Brandon was back there
[1:30:05] he's a prophet he making God a respecter
[1:30:11] of persons you know making him like -
[1:30:13] when God created me William Branham I
[1:30:16] was before the foundation of the world
[1:30:17] he made my being my spirit I wasn't
[1:30:23] conscious if anything as far as I know
[1:30:26] of I don't die on that he just made a
[1:30:28] spirit no we're gonna find out the
[1:30:34] spirit can't die
[1:30:35] so you got a problem okay so I said
[1:30:39] don't die on that one he said he made my
[1:30:42] being
[1:30:43] my spare another words he made me he
[1:30:45] made my life not just a second realm
[1:30:50] that's the part of it
[1:30:52] he made my being my spirit I wasn't
[1:30:56] conscious of anything as far as I know
[1:30:58] uh but the I was dire oh I don't believe
[1:31:03] you're getting it but now just a minute
[1:31:08] Jesus told the disciples that he knew
[1:31:11] them before the foundation of the world
[1:31:12] and Paul said here that he chose us in
[1:31:17] him before the world again come on
[1:31:21] that's John and
[1:31:21] Jesus that I chose you you didn't choose
[1:31:24] me that's the two scriptures I've been
[1:31:27] quoting John and evasions what now there
[1:31:31] was some part of me Armand Neville and
[1:31:38] you know he ain't our man elbow so he
[1:31:40] wasn't saying it that what he was saying
[1:31:42] there was some part of me it's some part
[1:31:44] of our man Neville and the rest of you
[1:31:48] all here that's in Christ Jesus before
[1:31:54] the foundation of the world then he
[1:31:59] describes what happened to us when he
[1:32:01] got here you know the story of that when
[1:32:06] we got here those angels brought us a
[1:32:10] nature the good angels are the ones that
[1:32:14] are signed to the children of God the
[1:32:19] other angels they give you a bad nature
[1:32:22] so you know what he's talking about the
[1:32:25] analysis what are you listening to
[1:32:29] evidently according to these couple of
[1:32:35] statements there was some part of us
[1:32:41] back before the world
[1:32:48] and what is it
[1:32:54] some part of us I didn't make this
[1:32:57] statement he did so I guess what we need
[1:33:00] to do is rip that an out cause it ain't
[1:33:02] right the other way
[1:33:04] well later why lost like another one you
[1:33:06] just rip out an out and throw it away
[1:33:09] you've got to deal with it and I'm the
[1:33:15] guy that's supposed to be dealing with
[1:33:16] it in the basis of being a pastor I'm
[1:33:19] supposed to be trying my best to save
[1:33:22] your soul Tory gets to be a burden but
[1:33:30] it ain't no burden to it
[1:33:31] there ain't no burden to being a
[1:33:33] preacher sure I get down and out run
[1:33:36] around get so down and out because it's
[1:33:41] hard to try to explain to people when
[1:33:43] they won't listen but a random said
[1:33:49] there was part of him before the world
[1:33:51] he said there was a part of our man
[1:33:53] devil before the world he said that's a
[1:33:55] part of you before the world now what is
[1:33:58] it
[1:34:05] waiting number four the Easter seal
[1:34:10] there's only one life one eternal spirit
[1:34:13] when he turned a life and that's God
[1:34:15] that's God God alone is the eternal and
[1:34:20] then we being his children are part of
[1:34:24] him how much plainer can we get what is
[1:34:29] his children that is the attributes of
[1:34:31] his thinking this is children
[1:34:35] and the thought is expressed and becomes
[1:34:40] a word then each individual in here that
[1:34:47] possesses this eternal life
[1:34:50] that's not everybody sitting there right
[1:34:52] come on read it
[1:34:54] the ones who possess eternal life in
[1:35:04] each individual in here that possesses
[1:35:07] this eternal life was before the
[1:35:10] foundation of the world in God's
[1:35:13] thinking it's the only way it could be
[1:35:18] because you're an attribute he said what
[1:35:23] we were just in his thinking who talked
[1:35:28] to you what I believe I don't want to be
[1:35:30] a part of his thinking because that
[1:35:32] thought of Judas but if I'm part of the
[1:35:35] thinker then I mean he's thinking no
[1:35:40] everybody in the world was in he's
[1:35:41] thinking that's an expression of a
[1:35:47] thought has become a word and the word
[1:35:49] has taken life in this eternal that's
[1:35:52] the reason we have eternal life in the
[1:35:54] same principle that the great son of God
[1:35:56] the Redeemer we have eternal life the
[1:36:01] same way he had he turned life the
[1:36:04] Redeemer we become sons and daughters of
[1:36:06] God through the same spirit by the same
[1:36:09] foreknowledge of God they were way back
[1:36:13] behind full knowledge we're back into
[1:36:16] him and being part of him
[1:36:19] and not just being somebody thought of
[1:36:25] I'll read this one but then we'll stop
[1:36:27] on the next okay go ahead to number five
[1:36:29] we read this one and I'll quit Christ is
[1:36:33] revealed in his own word now the same
[1:36:36] thing is this if see that's why I love
[1:36:42] brother Branham the way here you'll say
[1:36:44] if you have eternal life you always was
[1:36:47] eternal if you're a son of God
[1:36:51] it's that stuff do you mean it's not him
[1:36:55] designating who's what if you are a son
[1:37:01] of God and if I am a son of God her
[1:37:04] daughter of God we were in God at the
[1:37:07] beginning and when Jesus became the
[1:37:11] fullness of the word then we were in him
[1:37:15] what germ form what his journal word
[1:37:21] when he was crucified he was crucified
[1:37:24] in his body when he rose from the dead
[1:37:28] we rose with him and now since we have
[1:37:32] recognized it now since we've recognized
[1:37:35] it
[1:37:36] now we're sick getting together with him
[1:37:39] in heaven we're sat together with him in
[1:37:42] heavenly places in Christ Jesus II where
[1:37:45] he we if we are sons and daughters of
[1:37:49] God we are God's children and we are
[1:37:53] attributes of God then we were God
[1:37:56] eternal life and God is the only eternal
[1:37:59] out that there is then we were in him
[1:38:02] from the beginning in when Jesus become
[1:38:09] all that word then we were part of him
[1:38:13] then amen there you are
[1:38:15] when that's in dire there's no devil no
[1:38:18] powers no nothing can ever move it
[1:38:21] that's the top post those are so you can
[1:38:27] be anointed out here
[1:38:30] in this spirit and desire and do all
[1:38:34] these other things but when it comes
[1:38:37] down to this top pose to that word
[1:38:40] you'll never move from there it'll hold
[1:38:45] right steady and truth to that word as
[1:38:49] it can be outside of that regardless of
[1:38:52] what you do you're still lost okay
[1:39:00] where's no brother Dale you didn't
[1:39:03] answer the question what part are we
[1:39:10] well we were before the foundation of
[1:39:12] the world it's Paul Harvey said we'll
[1:39:16] take it up page 2 you know that Paul
[1:39:20] Harvey he'd bring news more than you'd
[1:39:22] say
[1:39:22] and now that's page 2 in other words
[1:39:24] he's gonna start over once knock me out
[1:39:26] so you going out to come next Sunday
[1:39:28] no brother for when he called me priest
[1:39:30] Wednesday you get the rest of the story
[1:39:33] you're gonna have to come next Sunday oh
[1:39:38] no I said that cuz they're like gonna be
[1:39:39] missing
[1:39:40] well that's verse not dirty in I didn't
[1:39:43] mean it they're just gonna be a lot
[1:39:47] missing next Sunday they already told me
[1:39:49] there was okay but listen I hope you
[1:39:55] understand one time I do not believe
[1:40:01] that we as human elements come into the
[1:40:08] world with eternal life
[1:40:09] no were within us whatsoever I don't
[1:40:17] believe that I believe you've got to get
[1:40:18] going to receive eternal life you got to
[1:40:21] be born again to receive eternal life
[1:40:26] and you better remember that thought I
[1:40:29] was making there's gonna be a lot of
[1:40:31] people at the white throne judgment be
[1:40:33] given eternal life that don't make them
[1:40:37] a part of the body of Christ
[1:40:40] then I wish you would think just for a
[1:40:42] minute what a little second the Old
[1:40:47] Testament Saints is jehovah's bride
[1:40:51] right they don't have eternal life Jesus
[1:40:58] Christ had died we got to add him to
[1:41:02] deal with that's the easy to deal with
[1:41:04] it because the way he started him off no
[1:41:07] problem but none of the Old Testament
[1:41:10] Saints that's why they had to go to
[1:41:13] paradise and wait and Jesus Christ could
[1:41:20] come to paradise and pick him up
[1:41:24] put him into a wonderful position would
[1:41:30] not take him to the presence of Almighty
[1:41:32] God they didn't have eternal life back
[1:41:37] there those great ones those great
[1:41:41] prophets they didn't have eternal life
[1:41:45] dwelling within them the great John the
[1:41:49] Baptist he said buddy wait a minute
[1:41:52] she's gonna be careful John I'm very
[1:41:53] careful with John John received eternal
[1:41:56] life in the mother's wound if you want
[1:41:58] to call it that if you want to go with
[1:42:01] that but you better be careful how you
[1:42:04] go with it
[1:42:08] because he would have been an
[1:42:10] impartation John the Baptist never went
[1:42:14] through justification sanctification and
[1:42:17] the baptism of the holy ghost do you
[1:42:19] become a child of God am i right I'm
[1:42:27] just asking you to be sensible so if
[1:42:30] that's not true then all of those Old
[1:42:32] Testament Saints according to Hebrews
[1:42:35] 11:40 they're waiting on you and I to
[1:42:38] come to a place so is all of the people
[1:42:41] down through the church ages their way
[1:42:44] to go in you and I to reach a place so
[1:42:49] where's the foolish virgins being
[1:42:52] connected with you but
[1:42:54] of the situation's it's always the
[1:42:57] fields you so with everything hinged
[1:43:00] upon whether or not we are his children
[1:43:04] you realize what I'm saying old
[1:43:07] testament job was right New Testament is
[1:43:09] the children of God foolish virgins and
[1:43:12] rest them they're not the children I'm
[1:43:13] gone you tell me they are where you
[1:43:21] gonna get it the children of God is that
[1:43:25] group of people on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:29] to the rapture of the church that's the
[1:43:35] ones I'm talking about that were a part
[1:43:39] of God before the world ever begun they
[1:43:45] are his offspring they're his children
[1:43:49] that's why he would say I go to my
[1:43:52] father and your father he said I go to
[1:43:55] my god and your God there's a special
[1:44:01] group of people in that middle part
[1:44:03] called the bride of Jesus Christ what a
[1:44:08] wonderful opportunity for you and I to
[1:44:11] be able to be a part of that did you
[1:44:16] follow me
[1:44:16] Old Testament Saints they're not too
[1:44:19] bright as Jesus Christ they rejected
[1:44:21] that right foolish virgins and people
[1:44:27] after they're not Bride of Christ it's
[1:44:34] only the group that's in the middle that
[1:44:35] is his bride and who do you think he
[1:44:37] come to get do you know it right around
[1:44:41] said only the predestinate is considered
[1:44:43] in Redemption the Old Testament Saints
[1:44:48] are going to be given the foolish
[1:44:54] virgins and the 144,000 and their fields
[1:45:01] you they're going to be given
[1:45:04] but they don't get eternal life here and
[1:45:08] like I'm part of the bride what a
[1:45:10] wonderful opportunity the children of
[1:45:13] God has to know and realize that we are
[1:45:17] his children
[1:45:21] we are his offspring we're all born
[1:45:27] kinfolks to the devil right but the new
[1:45:31] birth makes us kinfolks to God see we're
[1:45:36] going to prove what we are come on
[1:45:37] musician we're going to prove what we
[1:45:39] are
[1:45:46] what a wonderful opportunity it is to
[1:45:51] know the truth
[1:45:59] I'd rather be humanly speaking we just
[1:46:12] keep trying one of these days we're
[1:46:16] gonna realize the Bible is right it even
[1:46:24] tells us what I think of that one today
[1:46:26] he said we don't know what kind of a
[1:46:28] body will have right they said we'll
[1:46:30] have a glorious body like unto his body
[1:46:35] how many of us back in the denominations
[1:46:38] and like what we heard of this message
[1:46:39] would have ever made a statement that
[1:46:41] Jesus his body had to be redeemed and
[1:46:47] many people in the message even know
[1:46:48] that his body was not eternal it was
[1:46:52] created in the big created it had a
[1:46:54] beginning it had to be made eternal in
[1:46:57] the resurrection his body that did not
[1:47:03] to be redeemed caught it was a sinner
[1:47:05] it had to be redeemed because it had a
[1:47:07] beginning think on these things
[1:47:16] okay let's stand together what a mighty
[1:47:19] God we serve we appreciate these
[1:47:21] children the singing and worshipping

[1:54:55] of things I'll sit down and read and
[1:54:57] I'll study and read the message but you
[1:54:59] know you just think about how real God
[1:55:05] is see think it's wonderful the more
[1:55:13] real do you think about how he is now
[1:55:18] wonderful he is but what he's done for
[1:55:22] me and you he gave his own life that you
[1:55:28] and I could live all he's wanting us to
