[1:04] amen that's the mystery of this whole
[1:06] thing am how a bunch of people that
[1:09] doesn't look like
[1:12] much but we're exactly what he saw in
[1:14] his mind before the foundation of the

[1:25] changed right and he does not
[1:28] change right you love the
[1:32] Lord well getting that together we'll T
[1:37] remember next
[1:38] weekend parents just said
[1:40] to remember to get Daddy 70
[1:44] something probably I told him the other
[1:47] day I said it's kind of I think me and
[1:49] sister Peggy Gibby were talking about
[1:51] something and I said yeah it's kind of
[1:53] strange you start out with no teeth of
[1:55] Bibb and Dippers and you end the same
[1:57] way
[2:01] so maybe somebody can get him 70
[2:03] diapers or
[2:06] bibs somebody give him that's somebody
[2:09] give Mom and Daddy a a a John Deere bib
[2:12] somebody here at church did I think and
[2:14] that's what they wear when we go
[2:16] somewhere they put that bib on so that U
[2:19] they don't get any food on their their
[2:21] clothes so I'm sure I'll hear from
[2:24] that may not be here next week

[3:09] just lost right but if you're
[3:10] backsliding then you come

[3:27] of a sudden he sees us stand right back
[3:30] up yes sir that's one thing the devil

[3:36] that you can get knocked down and get
[3:38] right back up and say thank you Lord for
[3:42] that trial that I just went through the
[3:45] book of Romans we'll start back and read
[3:46] the the 30th ver but U let's bow our
[3:49] head before we
[3:51] begin dear heavenly father we thank you

[4:54] Bride of Jesus Christ just bless us and
[4:57] be with us forgive us of our sin in
[5:00] Jesus name we pray amen Romans 8:30
[5:04] moreover whom he did
[5:07] predestinate them he also called and
[5:10] whom he called them he also Justified
[5:13] and whom he
[5:15] justified them he
[5:17] also glorified what shall we then say to
[5:20] these things let's all read that
[5:22] together if you don't mind if God be
[5:25] before us who can be against us you may
[5:28] SE
[5:30] word if the Lord before us who can be
[5:33] against
[5:35] us Brother Richard asked me that I want
[5:38] to race that I said no I don't know
[5:39] where I'd start
[5:41] at but and this morning let's just kind
[5:44] of background just for a minute but uh
[5:47] we were talking about justification in
[5:49] baby form sanctification in the baby
[5:51] form and then the baptism of the holy
[5:54] ghost in a baby form because when the
[5:55] baby's born the baby has all that they
[5:59] need
[6:00] to take them into the journey but you
[6:04] must go through the Journey all right
[6:07] you must grow in Grace and knowledge you
[6:10] must grow even Jesus Christ in a human
[6:12] body the Bible says he grew in faith and
[6:16] stature and he was
[6:19] perfected in what he saw here on the
[6:22] earth and walking as God
[6:24] Almighty walking through the Earth as
[6:27] you and I not having to go through these
[6:31] things because he was already almighty
[6:34] God he was already Eternal in his soul
[6:38] and then he had to come down into a body
[6:40] of Flesh that was not Eternal and he had
[6:44] to learn the Bible says by the things he
[6:46] suffered that he grew in stature if you
[6:48] read the Bible it didn't say he grew in
[6:50] Statue that's this way statue is this
[6:53] way stature is what we're talking about
[6:55] the stature of a perfect man not a
[6:57] statue all right
[7:00] but he was The Headstone he was the
[7:03] fullness he was all this rolled up into
[7:06] one man and the reason that we can go
[7:11] and be the same person is because now
[7:14] that man that done all that force is now
[7:16] living inside of us okay that's why you
[7:18] and I can't do it ourselves we have to
[7:21] have help we have to have God Christ
[7:23] himself to come in the form of the Holy
[7:26] Spirit to come into your body amen and
[7:30] to be in your soul and and and brother
[7:32] dick and I were talking today it's kind
[7:34] of like these virtues I don't like the
[7:35] lines same way with Body Spirit and
[7:38] soul if you don't if you cut yourself in
[7:41] two there's not one ring two rings you
[7:43] know a third ring that's where you soul
[7:44] is no this is all a body and once you
[7:47] are born into this world B RN into this
[7:51] world that's just you
[7:54] amen
[7:55] okay but there has to be a starting
[7:58] point for God
[8:00] to work in because without a soul you'd
[8:02] be an animal right all right animal
[8:04] doesn't have a soul an animal is just by
[8:06] Nature Nature um rules him but he has a
[8:11] body of Flesh just like me and you right
[8:14] as I've said many times before sister
[8:16] Brandon I wondered why God if if he
[8:18] wanted to
[8:20] create through the spoken word why did
[8:23] he give us a body with the body parts to
[8:26] bring it through sex on in the Earth
[8:30] we're just a higher form of animal right
[8:33] God it would be this complimentary for
[8:36] God to make a man and a a male dog
[8:38] female dog male bear female bear and
[8:41] then make me and you just be
[8:43] nothing no he made us in the same order
[8:46] gave us the same parts we got no
[8:48] different parts than a dog or a cat as
[8:50] far as hands they're just made a little
[8:52] different same way with all our other
[8:54] organs so we're just a higher form of
[8:56] animal except there's one thing about us
[8:58] God thought so so much of us that he
[9:01] made us a soul he gave us life all right
[9:06] and he gave us a
[9:08] choice right even Cain he gave Cain a
[9:11] choice if you'll do right right then
[9:15] I'll Bless you that's right right so
[9:18] here we are in a body that we're living
[9:20] in now and and you can't once you once
[9:23] God comes in and gives you a soul that
[9:25] at Birth your natural birth then he
[9:28] can't you can't divide any of the
[9:31] three right the only thing that divides
[9:34] the three is death natural it takes
[9:37] what's inside of you and puts in another
[9:39] dimension and this guy stays here
[9:41] because it's in the fall all right
[9:44] there's a bar that's holding your body
[9:45] here because your body is connected to
[9:47] this Natural Earth but now your soul and
[9:50] spirit goes into another dimension but
[9:53] you can't take your spirit out of you or
[9:55] you're dead can't take your soul out of
[9:58] you because that's the you that's that's
[10:00] what motivates that's us that's what you
[10:02] see that makes this move so there's not
[10:05] any but just for for purpose of us being
[10:09] human the prophet had to draw one Circle
[10:11] for the man and one Circle for the
[10:13] spirit and one Circle for the soul but
[10:15] you can't separate them now once God put
[10:17] that in my body that's why brother R
[10:19] said he said I have a problem with
[10:21] people believing this
[10:23] transmigration
[10:25] Reincarnation of souls because once that
[10:28] soul is put in in this body of me that's
[10:30] why this scripture can be fulfilled
[10:32] brother dick that's why he can say those
[10:35] he who has Justified he is already
[10:38] glorified if not if we were going to get
[10:40] a new body like most people teach and a
[10:42] lot of people in the message think this
[10:44] body just going to be thrown away and
[10:46] we're going to get a brand new
[10:48] one then you do away with that scripture
[10:51] cuz those who he's Justified he's
[10:52] already glorify all right so you and I
[10:55] are bringing ourself or he's bringing us
[10:58] under
[11:00] subjection to the word of God I'll read
[11:03] it to you in just just a minute Brother
[11:04] Gary and I were discussing something and
[11:06] actually kind of helped me put a little
[11:07] punctuation mark on here by going back
[11:10] to the greatest battle ever fought which
[11:13] that is the greatest battle ever fall
[11:14] right it's in your
[11:16] mind if you're born again it's not in
[11:19] your soul that's right it's in your
[11:23] mind all right so we'll get to that in a
[11:26] second because you're going to see that
[11:29] we're going to take lonox man and
[11:31] Eagle because these four death
[11:33] Messengers eat the eat the eat the uh
[11:36] the tree down and then the four life
[11:38] Messengers are going to bring it
[11:40] back but to catch back up now we' come
[11:43] up to Faith and here we're born again it
[11:45] starts your journey you're a born again
[11:47] Christian in your soul you're just as
[11:50] Eternal as God
[11:51] is you know if you die you go right
[11:54] straight into that sixth
[11:55] Dimension but the ones of us that are
[11:57] still alive we got work to do
[11:59] right all right the ones that are dead
[12:01] and go on there's nothing you can do
[12:03] about it but you and I are here and you
[12:07] and I have been right here moreover whom
[12:11] he did
[12:12] predestinate them he also called right
[12:16] right he's called this age or called you
[12:21] this people amen he's called you to
[12:24] this sir does everybody understand that
[12:27] right he's called you to this that's
[12:29] right right he didn't call you to be a
[12:31] Baptist
[12:34] right he didn't call you to be a
[12:37] Brandi he calls you to be
[12:40] Christ that's right have the mind
[12:44] of not the mind of a man not the mind of
[12:47] anyone else but the mind of Christ
[12:50] and here's our journey then our journey
[12:53] began we talk about this morning our
[12:55] journey truly
[12:56] began when we were born again and we
[12:59] started listening to the word of God
[13:02] because the word of God the Bible says
[13:05] we are Washed by the Water of the word
[13:07] am when brother Bram saw the dream or or
[13:10] sister Shepherd had the dream and
[13:11] brother Bram saw it himself he saw what
[13:14] a man pouring water into a basin right
[13:20] which was up here he was pouring water
[13:23] in that Bas and what was coming out he
[13:25] said it was
[13:26] trash right okay right sister Gwen
[13:30] brought and I'm glad I like feedback I
[13:32] brothers or sisters kids it doesn't
[13:34] matter but sister Gwen was saying that
[13:37] that brother hter a long time ago
[13:39] brother R said there would be a message
[13:40] sweep out right to end this thing right
[13:44] we think about sweep ACR no why don't we
[13:46] take a
[13:48] broom and let's sweep out that's right
[13:52] that's what these virtues are doing
[13:54] that's why when that man was pouring
[13:56] that water in which was the word right
[13:59] what was coming out trash right what was
[14:02] coming out the trash side of
[14:05] this right the white horse rider was
[14:08] riding away what the one that was trying
[14:10] to
[14:11] impersonate okay that's anti right
[14:15] that's what you want to see riding away
[14:17] the Antichrist of this but the real
[14:19] Christ is going to make you white red
[14:22] black and
[14:23] pale all right and we'll go through it
[14:25] just now all right so we got the
[14:28] justification and we show that if you're
[14:31] truly Justified you're just as righteous
[14:32] as God God said that I
[14:35] didn't so he's making you the very
[14:38] righteousness of God and then it shows
[14:40] that all that nonsense is being pushed
[14:43] out same way in
[14:46] sanctification we see in sanctification
[14:49] and I I was uh we were talking
[14:51] downstairs
[14:52] and you know there's a lot
[14:55] of people that we were talking about
[14:57] here at sanctification that that that
[14:59] thinks they're born again and and that's
[15:02] a real real horrible place to be but
[15:06] that's where a lot of your foolish
[15:07] burdens are going to come from the
[15:10] reason I believe that is because if
[15:12] you're if you're caught out into those
[15:14] denominations now don't get me wrong
[15:17] there
[15:17] are there are dispensations of time when
[15:21] brother Brandon was preaching he was
[15:23] preaching to a dispensation that he was
[15:25] bringing them from the old Pentecostal
[15:27] and bringing them into the new way or
[15:30] his or his age all right bride age it
[15:32] didn't say that they weren't bride right
[15:34] all right but he was bringing them from
[15:36] the old father Son and Holy Ghost
[15:38] baptism because remember FF Bosworth
[15:41] brother R say was a great man of Faith
[15:44] spent two hours shaking hands with his
[15:45] convert so we know he went to heaven but
[15:48] he was a
[15:50] trinitarian he never accepted water
[15:53] baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[15:55] why brother Brown said that they were
[15:57] some caught back in another age
[16:01] that's why I believe in 1977 something
[16:03] did happen in
[16:06] 1977 the Gentile age
[16:09] ceased he said it would be the what the
[16:11] going up of the Gentile bride return of
[16:14] Christ to the Jews in 1977 I believe
[16:16] that old dispensation is
[16:19] over that's just my guess because after
[16:23] 77 brother Brown said you know better
[16:27] now you know better to be a woman
[16:29] preacher now you know better to be
[16:30] baptized in name father son Holy Ghost
[16:32] but These Foolish virgins a virgin is
[16:34] somebody that's virgin to the word of
[16:36] God and to be virgin to the word of God
[16:38] you can't be baptized in the name of
[16:40] Father Son and Holy Ghost and know that
[16:42] and be a virgin that's right because
[16:44] brother BR says anybody baptized name
[16:46] Father Son and Holy Ghost has taken a
[16:48] whse forehead all right but that was God
[16:51] went at that while the prophet was
[16:53] preaching he wied that in but now he
[16:56] calls everybody to repentance everybody
[16:58] should know
[17:00] that that baptism will not get you
[17:02] anywhere so a lot of people a lot of
[17:04] foolish version I believe going to come
[17:06] out of this message because this message
[17:08] is the most pure thing that there is
[17:10] amen and they can accept so much of it
[17:13] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[17:14] Jesus Christ walk as much as they can
[17:16] but like brother dick said you can have
[17:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day
[17:19] of your life on your spirit and die and
[17:21] go to hell why because you never
[17:26] accepted that right there that God did
[17:29] it and you have faith in what God
[17:32] did not what you did you had faith in
[17:35] what God did amen and see they can't
[17:38] even get that right in the message cuz
[17:39] they saying that he's just a man and
[17:41] then he become God and then he come back
[17:43] to a man again see that confuses people
[17:47] you can't grow you're only as high as
[17:49] your pastor is right I didn't say that
[17:52] to Prophet did you can't go beyond your
[17:55] pastor so if he believes that then guess
[17:58] what
[18:00] you can't go any further than that right
[18:02] so he took you to another
[18:04] God let me tell you something if we were
[18:06] to preach this thing brother dick line
[18:08] by line the way it should be y'all would
[18:11] be mad at me the world would be mad at
[18:13] most people because if you preach this
[18:15] thing the way it should be you know one
[18:17] time somebody said brother Brown said we
[18:19] got to get back to where they said
[18:20] that's not what Paul said right we got
[18:23] to get back to where we look at him and
[18:24] say that's not what we brand was talking
[18:26] about right because you know what he
[18:28] called us all to do something that's why
[18:30] he said those who he predestinated I
[18:32] read just a minute in the greatest
[18:35] battle L fault where he has equipped us
[18:38] for the battle see that's what we're
[18:41] doing right now we're equ we're being
[18:42] equipped for the
[18:44] battle cuz the greatest battle is going
[18:46] to be right up here in the mind the head
[18:48] part all right our hair is going to be
[18:50] in the head part that's right but it's
[18:53] only realizing that what got you started
[18:56] is ending it right right all right
[19:00] excuse me so now we come to
[19:03] sanctification here same way here but
[19:06] you're born again but we were talking
[19:07] about too that you could be
[19:10] blinded uh like the preacher was that
[19:13] that that you know wanted to beer and
[19:15] and brother R God took his servant off
[19:17] the scene so he wouldn't Mar his name uh
[19:20] there's a part in the Bible that you can
[19:23] turn someone over to the devil remember
[19:26] for the destruction of their what flesh
[19:28] so that their soul could be saved all
[19:32] right so that means that they're already
[19:34] born again they just got up in somewhere
[19:36] and somewhere the word's not letting
[19:38] that junk come out that's where a lot of
[19:41] me and you are right on that's right
[19:44] come on people that's where a lot of me
[19:45] and you are we're not letting this word
[19:48] do it we think we can do it we think
[19:51] we've been in a message all our life you
[19:53] got to have an experience with God
[19:55] people right a true experience something
[19:58] you can when the Devil Comes you can
[20:00] say yes St I've had enough of that
[20:06] stop all right so now we come to
[20:09] sanctification the red horse
[20:11] rider he literally killed millions of
[20:15] people 68 million people were killed in
[20:18] during the time of the Dark Ages when
[20:21] that red horse rider was
[20:23] writing but thank God the blood of Jesus
[20:25] Christ has Sanctified Millions yes amen
[20:28] since he was on the cross his blood has
[20:31] Sanctified millions of people and put
[20:34] them in the body of Christ put them
[20:37] in into a uh um you know I want to say
[20:43] the faith of the fathers which is true
[20:45] we'll get to that in a second get ahead
[20:47] on then the black horse rider the black
[20:50] horse rider was death we remember we
[20:52] could name him that then brother Ram
[20:55] comes up on the Statue of a perfect man
[20:57] I didn't read it this morning but I
[20:59] found it so I'll read
[21:02] it statute of perfect man 1962 now
[21:06] building The Virtue building this
[21:08] Monument building this statue see it
[21:10] starts off in the foundation that's on
[21:11] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[21:13] patience God and His brotherly kindness
[21:16] now what's it do then they're waiting
[21:19] for the headstone which is love for God
[21:21] is love and he controls and he is the
[21:22] strength of every one of these things
[21:24] yes sir right in here right in here see
[21:27] I got in between all these Works in here
[21:29] there's a little W coming down what is
[21:32] it the holy ghost coming down through
[21:34] Christ see Holy Spirit the holy spirit
[21:36] is above all this welding This
[21:40] Together building a what a perfect
[21:42] church for the Capstone to cap it off
[21:45] what's it been done again it's
[21:46] manifested through seven Church ages and
[21:48] seven Church Messengers so he's telling
[21:51] you why he wrote Holy Spirit right
[21:55] here
[21:56] okay because that's what's going to mold
[21:59] everything
[22:00] together remember what we said these
[22:04] three in
[22:06] one right now what is
[22:09] God he's three in one he's not three
[22:12] persons but he's three manifestations
[22:15] that horse rider is the last one right
[22:18] right and he rides off brother R said
[22:20] after that the Rapture takes place right
[22:23] right all these three in one well guess
[22:26] what all these three in one right
[22:30] everybody understand that's kind of
[22:31] simple isn't it all three in one that
[22:33] we're not talking about we're see we see
[22:36] four things but it's three manifested
[22:39] because four death Messengers which were
[22:41] these people the the the H can word you
[22:45] can actually put them in each one of
[22:46] these there's a sermon on that too but I
[22:48] I'll sa that one for later but you can
[22:51] put those death Messengers right in here
[22:53] with these horse riders where they eat
[22:55] away all the fellowship they eat away
[22:57] just the joy they do all that that's
[22:59] exactly what happened right
[23:01] here all right but for Life Messengers
[23:04] comes and brings it back which is what
[23:07] we started this morning you got the lion
[23:09] that come out in the first Age The Lion
[23:11] Spirit come out l i o n for those of you
[23:14] on the internet not lying lion Spirit
[23:17] went forth preaching what the true white
[23:20] word of God cuz it was pure back in the
[23:23] first age it was pure in the second age
[23:25] it was pure in the third age but the
[23:27] devil started coming back and brother
[23:28] Brown said he got off his White Horse
[23:30] and got on his red horse and started
[23:32] killing people during the O age right
[23:36] right o is what slow sacrificial all
[23:42] right kind of funny that it takes a red
[23:44] heer though to make
[23:47] sacrifice and that's during the red time
[23:49] of the red horse rider then you got the
[23:52] man which was what coming out with
[23:54] Luther and Wesley coming up into the
[23:57] intelligence of of
[23:59] man bringing this together amen then
[24:03] what do you end up
[24:06] with now all these are Earthbound
[24:11] creatures right
[24:13] right now you got a lion an ox a man in
[24:19] other words you got a lion he can't see
[24:21] but maybe to to that door is down here
[24:25] Ox is a little bit higher he can see a
[24:26] little bit further the man we stand up
[24:29] we can see way out further but you can't
[24:31] see any further than an
[24:33] eagle and to show you the growth
[24:37] development of an
[24:40] individual this little young right here
[24:42] starts out with
[24:45] what he becomes a meat eater but he
[24:48] starts out with milk that's
[24:50] right what this one start out with what
[24:54] do this one start out with but what does
[24:57] this one start out with
[25:03] Hallelujah that's good Lon starts out
[25:06] drinking milk amen then he eats meat o
[25:10] meat then goes to Grass man milk steak
[25:14] but when you come to that
[25:16] eagle he starts out eating meat that's
[25:20] why you see a progression of God in each
[25:22] one of these things this right here is
[25:24] not skim milk people right right when
[25:27] you come to that position position
[25:29] you're standing like Peter says Silver
[25:31] and Gold Have I None but such that I
[25:34] have I give unto you see we're way
[25:37] behind our privileges we think man we're
[25:39] way up here because brother Brown said
[25:40] we were in The
[25:42] Headstone he might have
[25:45] been the rest of us weren't right but we
[25:49] got to be to where we can eat some meat
[25:52] now even start out eating meat because
[25:54] what we're going to do is is we're going
[25:56] to start right back over
[26:02] all in
[26:10] three three stages three stages three
[26:20] stages three stages completes the
[26:24] birth down here three stages completes a
[26:28] birth here three stages is going to
[26:30] bring this head
[26:32] down and he's not going to come down on
[26:35] somebody drinking
[26:39] milk all right milk is right
[26:43] here now let don't get me
[26:46] wrong I still like
[26:50] milk but if you put a glass of milk and
[26:54] a Murphy steak
[26:58] the glass of milk could
[27:01] root I'm not saying let's do away with
[27:04] the milk because you know what I might
[27:05] reach and grab that glass of milk and
[27:06] eat when a St drink a
[27:09] St those of you been to Murphy know what
[27:12] I'm talking
[27:13] about I wish they had a way to get it
[27:16] out
[27:17] here be bigger than I am
[27:20] now but God wants us to grow in
[27:23] Christians just like we grow in
[27:24] individual people right so we've come to
[27:27] a place to where that God has molded
[27:29] this together because if you're not
[27:32] strong down here that's why brother said
[27:33] he had these waves that's why the Holy
[27:35] Spirit Wells this together if you got a
[27:37] little place right here that you got to
[27:38] Gap guess what's going to happen when
[27:40] this pressure comes down
[27:43] boom pressure comes right here boom
[27:47] what's going to happen you're going to
[27:49] rupture that's why brother R said that
[27:52] Holy Spirit welding it together all
[27:56] right see right here people and I'm
[27:59] going to say this and and say it pretty
[28:01] strong if we think we are here or if we
[28:05] decide that this is where we want to be
[28:08] this is not something that is the same
[28:10] as down here but yes it is but this down
[28:13] here is a baby a babbling baby that has
[28:16] to be led fed told what to do amen now
[28:20] this right here is not that right this
[28:22] is Faith of the fathers not faith of the
[28:25] babies right faith of the fathers that's
[28:27] what it says fathers not babies that's
[28:29] right faith of the fathers means the
[28:31] father has grown up right he's looking
[28:33] back and helping the babies right but
[28:36] he's come to a position to where God can
[28:38] use him as a father that he can look and
[28:42] see what the Father which is Christ
[28:46] wants to do with his word but people we
[28:48] got to realize these things right here
[28:50] have to be
[28:51] added or out of us the liono man an
[28:55] eagle they start out sure drinking a
[28:58] little milk but they have to all come to
[29:00] be meat eaters but when that eagle comes
[29:04] he's eating meat all the
[29:06] time he don't even look for milk I an
[29:09] eagle don't even have a um um what would
[29:11] you call a breast or anything like that
[29:13] an eagle eats meat Mama goes and gets
[29:16] the fish babies open their mouth they
[29:18] stick it down in the mouth but now one
[29:20] time see you can take that and type that
[29:22] is coming up to here and still having to
[29:24] be
[29:26] fed mouth fed right what we're doing now
[29:29] feeding from the
[29:30] mouth there comes a time when that eagle
[29:33] grows up and he goes and gets his own
[29:35] food that's right right but he don't go
[29:39] outside to get his own food his mama
[29:42] teaches him where to hunt that's right
[29:45] who's your mama New Jerusalem which is
[29:46] the word of God all right so we do have
[29:49] a mother and a father we have God which
[29:51] is our father and the Bible says our
[29:53] mother is New Jerusalem which is the
[29:55] word of God so we don't leave the word
[29:57] of God in any of this we don't leave the
[29:59] word of God out we're actually adding
[30:02] more word in all right now let's back up
[30:05] just one
[30:07] second now here we
[30:12] come this justification we know we
[30:15] did right right I'm erasing this you
[30:18] just kind of think a little bit about
[30:22] what's been
[30:24] said I'll write that
[30:26] again got to get this clean take it back
[30:39] downstairs all right this
[30:42] justification we know we done
[30:44] it there's no doubt we done it right and
[30:48] we have witnesses that we done it right
[30:50] right this
[30:53] justification there's no doubt we've
[30:55] done it but God is showing us by grace
[30:59] that it's all
[31:00] right that we did do it because we're
[31:03] coming to a place that is as if we
[31:07] never right as if now we've not come to
[31:10] the real you not doing it yet this is as
[31:14] if we never done
[31:16] it now that's
[31:19] why that's the little prosecute
[31:22] Woman Jesus knew for a
[31:26] fact that they were still under the
[31:29] law and when they threw that girl down
[31:32] in front of him that they said we caught
[31:36] her in the act of
[31:38] adultery they were Witnesses right right
[31:41] right we caught her in the act of
[31:44] adultery right what do you say so we
[31:48] know what Jesus done he stalled he
[31:49] stalled long enough for the Holy Spirit
[31:53] I believe to start speaking to those
[31:55] people right and they look back through
[31:58] their life and they saw what they had
[32:00] done so when they
[32:02] left Jesus you know he said you know he
[32:05] who has sin cast the first
[32:07] stone well now if one person had have
[32:12] stay one person
[32:15] right think about this if one person had
[32:18] a
[32:19] stayed Jesus would have had to Stone
[32:22] right cuz that was a witness that's
[32:24] right because in the Old Testament you
[32:26] had to have a witness that's right okay
[32:29] what he say it was a witness right right
[32:34] now Jesus turns around and says woman
[32:37] where are your
[32:41] accusers she looked around she said I
[32:43] have
[32:44] none you say well there was almighty God
[32:47] standing there in human flesh but Jesus
[32:51] did not see her do that that's right
[32:53] that's
[32:56] right oh if you can see that sir oh if
[33:00] you could just see
[33:01] that oh my that lady he she turn he
[33:05] turned around he said
[33:07] lady I didn't see you do it right right
[33:11] go and sin no more right but if one man
[33:14] would have stood there and said I
[33:16] witnessed it I saw it Stoner he would
[33:18] have had the stoner right right but when
[33:21] God gets R of your
[33:24] accuser he turns around and looks at you
[33:26] and says what did you
[33:30] do I didn't see you do
[33:33] it we're getting somewhere
[33:38] amen cuz real you didn't do it to start
[33:40] with
[33:42] right but you going to have accusers
[33:46] until then that's right but hang on a
[33:49] minute but that little
[33:51] woman Jesus told her to go and sin no
[33:55] more and I believe she did
[33:59] I don't know what ever happened to her
[34:00] but I don't believe she did what she
[34:02] done
[34:05] before but we come from justification
[34:07] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[34:09] spirit in the in the
[34:12] pyramid and we see that Christ comes
[34:14] down and molds everything together makes
[34:17] you a walking instrumentality of God but
[34:19] we're not finished yet we still have to
[34:23] get rid of our accusers right our
[34:25] accuser there's really only one accuser
[34:26] of the brethren and that's the devil all
[34:29] right but now
[34:32] look
[34:35] justification to
[34:37] glorification so we got to start and we
[34:39] got to see that in The Headstone of the
[34:43] the the building of this Temple there
[34:45] was or the building of this statue there
[34:46] was not a head put on it right right it
[34:49] was left right it was left level you
[34:52] know right here all right but there has
[34:55] to be something come that's different
[34:59] say
[35:00] different not different remember brother
[35:03] brand said it's got to either be in the
[35:04] word or it's anti christ it's all got to
[35:07] be in the word of God and we know to
[35:09] save a little time we not read it but
[35:13] now we look and
[35:16] see
[35:18] justification in The
[35:20] Headstone and we wonder how we going to
[35:22] get to there well there's a few more
[35:25] seals left if you don't mind remember
[35:28] this is the first seal second seal third
[35:29] seal fourth seal
[35:31] right what about the fifth
[35:35] seal you said what's that got to do with
[35:39] me
[35:41] well in the fifth
[35:44] seal if you want to read it we not read
[35:46] it stay some
[35:48] time brother Rand comes up to a group of
[35:52] people that
[35:55] has actually turned God
[35:59] down
[36:01] right
[36:03] and they're called a fifth seal
[36:06] Jew now you and I are Jews spiritually
[36:10] they were they're going to they're a
[36:11] natural set of Jews all right let me
[36:13] back up just a minute the natural set of
[36:15] Jews to put them in this fifth seal sold
[36:18] under the altar crying how long how long
[36:19] to avenge our blood see abing and
[36:22] Christian doesn't do that right Bing and
[36:25] Christian says how long how long but
[36:26] when you put to a blood then it brings
[36:28] in a whole different group of people all
[36:31] right because they were not born again
[36:32] that fifth seal Jew was not born again
[36:35] they were given eternal life by the
[36:38] grace of almighty
[36:39] God so what's that got to do with
[36:43] us when you get to the point that the
[36:47] real you didn't do it to start with if
[36:50] that ain't Grace
[36:52] right
[36:54] unmerited
[36:56] favor nothing you done that's right to
[37:00] deserve
[37:00] it you say well that's the same as this
[37:03] down here I told
[37:05] you eternity is in a
[37:08] circle right you just keep going around
[37:10] you're just going to keep going around
[37:12] and around and
[37:14] around there's no difference from this
[37:17] one to this one except the position that
[37:19] God has you in in the word of God right
[37:22] this is a baby form this is the form how
[37:25] in the world can you get eternal etal
[37:27] life and those people get eternal life
[37:31] turning God
[37:33] down it had to be Grace right brother R
[37:37] says he said it's the great greatest
[37:39] Grace
[37:41] seal I'll read it just a second right
[37:46] here listen it says in the fifth seal
[37:49] 1963 they realized they murdered their
[37:53] Messiah now same way with me and you we
[37:56] come to a real ization something here
[37:59] right see they were guilty of murder so
[38:01] they got murdered but being that they
[38:03] were blinded by God his grace reached
[38:05] down to them talk about Amazing Grace
[38:08] and gave each one of them a
[38:16] robe I don't see anything else if it's
[38:19] not Grace
[38:21] people you want to prove it turn to Zach
[38:30] it's a hard one for me to
[38:38] find right before
[38:42] Malachi that
[38:50] four verse
[38:53] six then he answered and spake unto me
[38:55] saying this is the word of the Lord
[38:58] unto zerubabel saying not by might nor
[39:02] by power but by my spirit sayi the Lord
[39:04] of host who art
[39:07] thou oh great
[39:10] Mountain before jerub Thou shalt become
[39:14] a flame and he shall bring forth The
[39:20] Headstone
[39:22] thereof the shouting crying what
[39:30] that's enough for
[39:33] me
[39:38] great brother BR said one time he said
[39:41] if we knew what the grace of God was he
[39:44] said we'd take a
[39:45] RT amen and that's what it is we're
[39:48] still here because we're not we don't
[39:50] get the grace of God like we should
[39:52] right but we got to be like them fifth
[39:54] seal Jews we got to be able to accept
[39:56] Grace accept that robe except what God's
[39:59] already done for us see everybody thinks
[40:02] well boy it's going to get greater and
[40:03] we're going to have to jump through
[40:04] hoops brother R said it's just a
[40:07] change but right there when I was
[40:10] reading that I thought
[40:11] well you go back to zerubabel and that's
[40:15] what he said he said he shall bring
[40:17] forth The Headstone and that's what that
[40:18] is right amen with shoutings crying
[40:22] Grace Grace unto it
[40:28] this guy never did
[40:30] it that's
[40:36] right why he shows him those Jews how
[40:41] can God give them eternal life and see
[40:42] what they
[40:45] done they turned down the
[40:47] Messiah right they literally physically
[40:50] killed him physically they put him to
[40:54] death but just because of me and you he
[40:57] blinded that group of people Y and
[40:59] they're going to have to accept the
[41:01] grace that they don't know anything
[41:02] about
[41:06] amen so they never did it in the first
[41:08] place right
[41:11] right all these right here you're going
[41:14] to see one
[41:15] thing this has one
[41:18] thing to do
[41:30] talking about
[41:31] this
[41:35] right we come to this
[41:38] place in Divine Healing brother BR said
[41:40] no Divine Healing nor
[41:42] Resurrection now when brother Brandon
[41:44] was
[41:45] Discerning um say a lady and she had u a
[41:49] tumor cancer he called one time a spider
[41:52] cancer it was all in her stomach and he
[41:56] pronounced her
[41:58] heal now if you were to take an x-ray of
[42:01] that
[42:02] lady God just didn't take that out like
[42:04] a surgeon would and leave
[42:08] scars he actually restored those cells
[42:10] back to its original condition that's
[42:12] right right same way with the man that
[42:15] that cut off you know Peter cut off the
[42:17] ear Jesus reached and grabbed that ear
[42:19] and I believe he put it right back on
[42:20] and I don't believe there's no there was
[42:22] no Telltale sign that that had ever
[42:24] happened right right see say well what
[42:27] what are you getting to we got to
[42:29] believe it that's right that's why he
[42:32] said no Divine Healing no Resurrection
[42:34] God doesn't just patch things up right
[42:37] when he heals you he restores you back
[42:40] to original
[42:42] condition hallelujah amen that's what
[42:46] the headstone is people right it's
[42:48] restoration back to original condition
[42:52] you said well brother random died listen
[42:54] there's a lot more to go with this I'm
[42:55] just trying to get us to this point
[42:57] okay we can get to this point we're
[42:59] going to live a lot better life all
[43:02] right so let's just kind of take this
[43:03] step by
[43:04] step and it's kind of like Daddy said
[43:07] Wednesday night which that we were
[43:09] talking about Thursday
[43:11] and
[43:13] um Jesus was glorified right in front of
[43:16] the people in front of the three
[43:18] Witnesses
[43:21] right and but he went on to death right
[43:25] but you and I have to realize one one
[43:28] thing from that condition forward he was
[43:32] doing it to get us right
[43:34] herebody understand that he was doing it
[43:36] to get us right here he went through all
[43:38] the Death Barrel Resurrection Ascension
[43:40] and all that so that you and I don't
[43:42] have to go through if we accept it amen
[43:46] but his body was
[43:49] glorified on that mountain that's what
[43:51] the Bible say that's where your
[43:53] glorification is going to come from
[43:55] that's we we'll we'll get into that
[43:56] maybe later or I know
[43:58] D but
[44:01] justification in The Headstone we must
[44:03] realize that we never did it to start
[44:05] with it's not even held accountable now
[44:08] let me tell you
[44:11] something if this is true justification
[44:14] down here in the baby
[44:16] form that's the same as that
[44:20] right that's
[44:23] right those who he has truly Justified
[44:27] yes sir he's
[44:29] already glorified that's right
[44:34] amen that's why people this is going to
[44:37] be so
[44:38] simple I know everybody wants some big
[44:40] swelling ending to this
[44:42] story but it's just going to be this
[44:45] right here put right
[44:47] here and then your journey in between y
[44:51] because God don't seek justification and
[44:54] glorification
[44:57] that's what God
[44:59] say right he sees that right there right
[45:02] if he saw in between he'd have to kill
[45:04] all of us right right that's right but
[45:06] he sees you Justified sees you glorified
[45:08] one condition right here but if he saw
[45:11] the journey in between he would have to
[45:12] kill us thank God for the
[45:15] blood now same way when we get here the
[45:19] sanctification what was the six
[45:22] seal we can get in all this
[45:25] stuff board's not big enough
[45:28] what was the six
[45:30] seal the prophet said the six seal was a
[45:35] total Interruption of
[45:38] nature when those two prophets come on
[45:40] the scene they open that six seal they
[45:42] bring fire out of Heaven they bring
[45:44] we've been studying it a little bit
[45:45] downstairs in the Book of
[45:47] Daniel he said they open that seal when
[45:49] they want to earthquakes Blood Fire
[45:54] whatever want they want to happen well
[45:56] guess what if they do it in the natural
[45:59] you and I have to have it in the
[46:00] spiritual for it to happen to Israel in
[46:03] the natural it has to happen to us in
[46:05] the spiritual first because we're
[46:07] spiritual Israel correct right then the
[46:10] world gets theirs so see it's in 3 to we
[46:13] get it Jews get it the Earth gets it
[46:15] right all in three everything you do
[46:17] should be in three
[46:19] right
[46:21] six brother Brown say it was a total
[46:23] Interruption of
[46:25] nature now he's talking talking about
[46:27] the nature in what the Earth the nature
[46:31] of the Earth all right nature like
[46:33] mother nature like trees
[46:35] and what about mine and your
[46:49] nature he's going to interrupt your
[46:53] nature that's right when your hand moves
[46:57] God's hand mov amen your foot moves I
[47:00] read you that quote this morning God's
[47:03] foot moves CU brother was coming to the
[47:05] end he was coming to charity and that's
[47:07] what he was talking about he said when
[47:09] your hand moves God hands move when your
[47:11] eyes see then God's eyes see God's going
[47:14] to interrupt your
[47:16] nature that's why brother R could see he
[47:19] could he saw that that the real will
[47:21] Bram didn't do it his nature had been
[47:24] interrupted or changed because he said
[47:27] I'm not the son of Charles N brown
[47:29] anymore he wasn't deny we can't deny our
[47:32] birth right right you can't deny your
[47:36] spiritual birth right but you just come
[47:39] to a place that that birth here has took
[47:42] you to a place to
[47:45] where
[47:47] therefore let's read Romans I let's read
[47:50] Romans
[47:53] again but Paul was positive
[47:57] you say okay I'm putting it all in the
[47:59] Bible Romans
[48:02] 8 verse
[48:09] one there is therefore
[48:13] now in my Bible have I have now
[48:17] Circle there is therefore now
[48:21] no it didn't say a little bit a pinch a
[48:26] half
[48:27] a
[48:28] quarter it says no right right there is
[48:32] therefore now no condemnation to them
[48:36] which are
[48:38] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[48:42] flesh but after the
[48:44] spirit I don't have to read nothing
[48:48] El when are we going to start believing
[48:50] that amen when we start thinking right
[48:54] when those flu get blown out amen
[48:58] because right now today
[49:01] actually this is what I'm trying to
[49:05] do right interrupt your
[49:09] nature and let it totally be
[49:12] changed because we need it I need it you
[49:15] need it we all need to be changed if we
[49:17] don't get changed here we're not going
[49:19] to get changed in the end or the change
[49:21] of the
[49:22] body but the word of God interrupts my
[49:25] nature every time I come to church
[49:28] it does and if it doesn't then there's
[49:31] something wrong with
[49:33] you but that's carrying on us hot is it
[49:36] is it any more now now look if this step
[49:40] down here is this
[49:42] big we take one
[49:45] step what's this step up
[49:47] here just the next step that's right
[49:52] yeah not a little B step and then a beer
[49:55] step that you got to really get way up
[49:57] here no it's a daily walk that's right
[50:01] right but you build one on top of the
[50:03] other amen
[50:05] right you can't start up here that's
[50:08] right right you can't miss a step that's
[50:13] right but I want you to see today we're
[50:16] going to finish but I want to come back
[50:17] just right here I want us to see today
[50:19] though even through all this all this
[50:23] Interruption of this
[50:25] chart is I want you people I want you to
[50:27] see if you're right here there's
[50:29] something you can do about it right
[50:31] right and if you're right here there's
[50:33] something you can do about it even if
[50:35] you're right here there's still
[50:37] something you can do about it right but
[50:39] it's a journey amen it's a journey up
[50:42] that God has said right here in Romans 8
[50:45] turn you turn it over one more time
[50:47] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[50:50] he also called right and whom he called
[50:55] them he also
[50:58] Justified and if he justified you if God
[51:01] truly Justified you then he truly is
[51:04] going to glorify you all right brother
[51:07] Ram you know he said take you out of the
[51:09] back side of the desert give you
[51:11] something for the people brother randam
[51:14] I believe was taken up over there in
[51:16] 1963 and he was taken up into a
[51:20] position that he received the
[51:24] headstone which was his adoption
[51:27] and he
[51:30] was I glorified if you want if you're
[51:34] taking up in a vision there's something
[51:35] changing about you it's not you're not a
[51:37] normal person I promise you that if
[51:40] you're taking up in seven angels and
[51:42] you're taking up in it physically he
[51:43] said he was lifted
[51:45] up he got something out there that you
[51:47] and I are going to have to go through
[51:49] but maybe not as dramatic as he did
[51:51] because he was a prophet bringing
[51:53] something to you and I but I still
[51:55] believe that we're going to have to come
[51:56] to place that we know that we know that
[51:58] we know that we not just write this on a
[52:01] piece of paper and real you never did
[52:03] that's right until we get out of here
[52:05] that accuser is going to blast us and
[52:07] blast us and blast us and blast us and
[52:10] then when he finished blasting us he's
[52:11] going to blast us again right then after
[52:14] he's done with that he's going to blast
[52:16] us
[52:16] again
[52:18] right don't you listen right here we get
[52:22] back to sanctification and six listen to
[52:24] this in 1963
[52:26] paragraph 409 the six
[52:31] seal now I want you to read with me as
[52:33] you do capture scriptures of this great
[52:36] event that we will see that this great
[52:38] secret or mystery that was under the
[52:40] Sixth Seal of the book of redemption now
[52:42] remember these are hidden mysteries and
[52:45] the six seal all together is one great
[52:47] big book just six Scrolls R together
[52:49] rolled together and it unwinds the whole
[52:52] book of
[52:53] redemption that's how the whole Earth
[52:57] was redeemed now who's got to be
[52:58] redeemed
[53:01] first who's got to be redeemed first
[53:04] right you and I that's right you and I
[53:06] have to be redeemed first so this is
[53:10] your book of
[53:12] redemption this is how you are to be
[53:15] redeemed and the prophet said six seals
[53:16] finishes Redemption right right after
[53:18] six seals there's no more Redemption is
[53:20] over six seal finishes Redemption but
[53:24] you got to have one more guy
[53:28] which this is what most people don't
[53:30] understand about the seventh seal he
[53:32] said it's a
[53:34] secret no one will know it but who
[53:38] yourself that's right your own person
[53:41] that's right you're the only person
[53:43] that's going to know when he
[53:49] comes so you got four seals fifth seal
[53:53] Grace Sixth Seal
[53:56] that's all this right here is
[53:59] that same way with here what are you
[54:01] doing you're interrupting the nature you
[54:03] have right here okay same thing right
[54:06] here what is this what is justification
[54:08] Grace that I still got this dirty old
[54:10] hand that I used to carry a beer around
[54:12] in right that I'm ashamed of right but
[54:16] look it now holds a
[54:18] Bible it now prays for people but you
[54:20] know what that's something I got to get
[54:22] over cuz God didn't see that other part
[54:25] that's right all he sees is the blood
[54:28] justification Grace justification it's
[54:31] the grace of God that he lets you go up
[54:33] through here and get get his divine
[54:35] nature sanctification same way
[54:37] interrupts your nature and keeps
[54:39] interrupting people that right
[54:41] there same thing here right
[54:45] right
[54:47] faith faith right Rapture and Faith
[54:52] right we don't have Rapture and faith
[54:54] yet that's right that is rap in faith
[54:58] brother R said the devil there's one
[55:00] thing he cannot impersonate
[55:05] that's he does not know how to be born
[55:07] again that's right right remember if he
[55:10] knows how to be born again he could be
[55:12] our brother but he does not know how to
[55:15] be born
[55:23] again listen right here 7 SE
[55:28] paragraph
[55:30] 557 now why let us prove it why it is
[55:33] the secret that no one knows about John
[55:36] was forbidden to write about it even
[55:37] write a symbol about it why this is why
[55:40] there's no activity in heaven it might
[55:42] give away the secret do you see it now
[55:44] it's so great it must be included
[55:46] because it's got to happen but when the
[55:48] seven Thunders now notice when the seven
[55:50] angels come forth to sound their trumpet
[55:52] there is one Thunder when Israel was
[55:54] gathered there was a trumpet when time
[55:56] shall be no more the last trumpet one
[55:58] Thunder but there's seven straight
[56:00] Thunders Right In A Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[56:03] that perfect number seven thunders in a
[56:05] row uttered not making just 1 2 3 4 5 6
[56:08] 7even Straight then Heavens couldn't
[56:11] write that Heavens can't know about it
[56:13] nothing else because there's nothing to
[56:15] go on it's a relaxing time it was so
[56:19] great till it secret kept from the
[56:22] Angels now why if Satan should get a
[56:25] hold of it he might do great damage
[56:27] there's one thing he don't know now he
[56:29] can interpret anything he wants to and
[56:31] imp perate any kind of gift I hope
[56:33] you're learning but he can't know this
[56:36] it's not even written in the word it's a
[56:39] total secret all right let's read on a
[56:41] little further the next paragraph if you
[56:44] want something to happen now you have to
[56:46] take my word for this I'm planning on
[56:47] doing something I know better to tell
[56:49] anybody about it not that that person
[56:51] will tell it but Satan will hear it see
[56:53] he can't get it in my heart there as
[56:56] long as God's got it closed up with the
[56:59] holy spirit so it's between me and God
[57:02] right right amen it's an individual
[57:05] affair with God here it's an individual
[57:08] affair with God here and it's an
[57:10] individual affair with God
[57:12] here when we walk out of here it's going
[57:14] to be individual Affair but everybody
[57:15] wants to know what this great seventh
[57:17] seal is the Bible says grieve not the
[57:21] holy spirit of God whereby you are SE
[57:24] sealed unto the name of your Redemption
[57:29] right that's what the great seventh seal
[57:31] is it's the culmination of this right
[57:37] here cuz Satan doesn't have faith if
[57:40] Satan had Faith he could have a
[57:41] revelation he have a revelation he'd be
[57:44] born
[57:45] again why do you think he keeps fighting
[57:48] oh he believes but he his belief is a
[57:52] hope
[57:54] remember Hope's not very good unless you
[57:56] hoping toward you're hoping toward
[57:58] something right but this right here is
[58:02] the same as this same as this same as
[58:06] this it's a
[58:08] secret because I can stand here all day
[58:12] and I could tell you I could write it on
[58:14] the board I could try to explain it but
[58:18] unless God reveals it to you it's still
[58:20] a
[58:21] secret it's still a secret so God
[58:24] reveals it to you right
[58:28] but he made two statements right here
[58:31] that that gets to
[58:34] me he talks about angels and the
[58:37] devil that's the only two people that
[58:40] can't be born
[58:41] again right the Angels didn't know
[58:44] anything about this people that's why
[58:46] they were silent they don't have to go
[58:48] through
[58:49] this right the Angels know nothing about
[58:52] they they're standing around the walls
[58:54] today shaking their head
[58:57] wondering how somebody can be lost they
[59:00] look at them lost over here and then
[59:02] they look at them doing what we're doing
[59:04] today you can understand that the devil
[59:07] same way he looks over here and sees how
[59:09] what happened over here and he sees
[59:11] what's happening over here and he can't
[59:13] understand it right it's a
[59:16] secret the mighty glorification of
[59:20] man that was once
[59:22] lost and now God put them in a place to
[59:24] where they never did it to start
[59:30] justification to
[59:32] glorification let me read you one more
[59:39] quote greatest batt Ever Fall paragraph
[59:43] 12 and so an Army first in getting ready
[59:46] for a battle first just got to select
[59:49] some
[59:50] soldiers Romans 8 says moreover them he
[59:53] who he predestinated him he called it he
[59:56] called a group of
[59:57] soldiers first he's got to call you
[59:59] select some soldiers they got to be
[1:00:02] dressed for a fight they got to be
[1:00:05] trained for a fight and I believe that
[1:00:07] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:00:09] is now ready to go in action I believe
[1:00:13] that God has been selecting his soldiers
[1:00:16] I believe he's been dressing them
[1:00:19] training them and the Battlefront is now
[1:00:21] set getting ready to start this great
[1:00:24] first battle that was ever fought was in
[1:00:26] heaven then the battle begin down here
[1:00:28] on Earth and begin in us and has been
[1:00:31] raging ever
[1:00:34] since paragraph 25 the great hour of
[1:00:37] charge is at hand Hallelujah Soldiers
[1:00:40] with armor gleaming color Streaming
[1:00:42] Faith and doubt is setting the
[1:00:44] themselves in array in this Tabernacle
[1:00:46] this morning doubt on one side faith on
[1:00:49] the other soldiers stand at your post of
[1:00:52] Duty hallelujah our captain the Morning
[1:00:54] Star leads on he never goes back he
[1:00:57] never don't know the word Retreat he
[1:00:59] don't have to retreat the greatest
[1:01:01] battle ever fought she's going on right
[1:01:03] in
[1:01:04] here right now amen that's right right
[1:01:08] now yes sir paragraph 55 see Satan's
[1:01:12] attack watch listen close as closing his
[1:01:15] attack is what disbelieving God's word
[1:01:19] that's his attack there can you see the
[1:01:21] greatest battle that's ever fought
[1:01:23] there's only two forces Satan and God
[1:01:26] now why didn't he put Satan God in
[1:01:29] you your zero
[1:01:32] out Satan and God and what Satan's
[1:01:35] weapon against you is to try to get you
[1:01:38] to disbelieve your weapon which is what
[1:01:41] the sword of the word of God he disarms
[1:01:44] you let's listen real quiet now listen
[1:01:46] if he can get you to disbelieve your
[1:01:48] weapon is equivalent if he gets you to
[1:01:51] believe that your weapon is not strong
[1:01:52] enough he's disarmed you oh brother
[1:01:54] Neville I hope you never dis believe
[1:01:56] that look he disarms you when he gets
[1:01:58] you to disbelieve that weapon when you
[1:02:00] lay that down that finishes your fight
[1:02:03] you're done hold that weapon don't you
[1:02:06] lay it down we see his unbelief and he
[1:02:09] said one more thing he wants to say
[1:02:11] before
[1:02:14] closing he give
[1:02:17] you a sword right here
[1:02:24] yes brother went out
[1:02:27] Tucson something struck his
[1:02:29] hand he said it was a
[1:02:32] sword but he said not only a sword that
[1:02:35] you have to have in a battle he said you
[1:02:38] have to have a mighty strong hand of
[1:02:41] Faith to hold on to that sword that's
[1:02:43] right he said when you're in battle he
[1:02:45] said it's the strong man with the
[1:02:46] strongest arm amen that pierces the
[1:02:49] heart of the
[1:02:51] enemy when you leave here
[1:02:54] today realize one thing if you're right
[1:02:58] here there's a word here in this church
[1:03:01] I believe that can teach you all the way
[1:03:03] up to St you a perfect man yes sir
[1:03:05] that's right there's a lot of
[1:03:07] places that this would blow people's
[1:03:10] mind it's been in a message for years
[1:03:12] I've seen it people I go around the
[1:03:14] world I go around I have been around the
[1:03:15] world
[1:03:17] almost but in this
[1:03:20] church the Holy Spirit has led this
[1:03:23] church and us to show us these things
[1:03:26] this is not new people this ain't
[1:03:28] nothing that ddy had already preached he
[1:03:30] just had maybe put it on the chart for a
[1:03:32] visual to see he's preached every bit of
[1:03:35] this for 20 something years this a
[1:03:38] something new right all right but maybe
[1:03:41] if I put it in in a little bit of a a
[1:03:43] visual form you can see it a little
[1:03:45] better three stages here three stages
[1:03:48] here three stages
[1:03:50] here said three stages completes the
[1:03:53] birth
[1:03:56] wherever you are
[1:03:58] today takes that home with you U it'll
[1:04:02] be on the internet go got it
[1:04:04] on on the uh video there and it'll be on
[1:04:08] the internet uh if you want to study it
[1:04:10] again but to receive the
[1:04:15] headstone is to receive Christ here
[1:04:19] first
[1:04:21] justification glorification right
[1:04:25] receiving Christ as your savior here
[1:04:27] receiving Christ as your savior here
[1:04:30] this right here makes you and him one
[1:04:32] that's right all together one all
[1:04:35] together one the true
[1:04:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit not another
[1:04:41] baptism not just believing the message
[1:04:43] not just saying I'm in the message not
[1:04:45] just believing well you know that's what
[1:04:47] brother Brown
[1:04:49] said I like quotes and quotes are
[1:04:52] strength to back up what God's bringing
[1:04:55] right because it come to a prophet and
[1:04:57] it was God speaking it but if you don't
[1:05:01] have put if you can't put it in your
[1:05:02] life it does not do any good to shout
[1:05:04] about brother rown doing all these great
[1:05:07] things it does not matter what our
[1:05:09] pastor does all these great things
[1:05:11] unless you take what that is and build
[1:05:14] on it as far as having faith yes right
[1:05:17] what did Brother randam say he said
[1:05:19] Divine Healing was to reach out and get
[1:05:21] the people's attention right Amen to see
[1:05:25] what divine healing all to see the word
[1:05:28] that's right and that's going to take
[1:05:30] you from Divine Healing why brother
[1:05:31] Brown said Divine no Divine Healing no
[1:05:33] Resurrection cuz when we come back when
[1:05:36] when when they come
[1:05:37] back if their glorified body they're not
[1:05:41] going to have limbs Mission they're not
[1:05:42] going to have an old part of them still
[1:05:45] there gray hair and what kind of God do
[1:05:48] we
[1:05:49] serve when Jesus raised
[1:05:51] Lazarus from the dead
[1:05:56] Mary
[1:05:57] said Master he
[1:06:00] stinketh now when he was raised from the
[1:06:02] dead and Jesus told him to take his
[1:06:04] grave clothes off you believe he was
[1:06:07] stinking
[1:06:11] then you know brother
[1:06:13] brandham many times you know he'd say
[1:06:18] talking about Lazar Soul where it was at
[1:06:20] where it went I thought about his body
[1:06:23] cu the soul was okay right that body for
[1:06:26] days was stinking
[1:06:28] bloating skin worms had already begun
[1:06:32] brother said his nose had fell in but
[1:06:34] with one
[1:06:37] voice Lazarus didn't come out doing this
[1:06:43] right no I believe he came out and the
[1:06:45] Bible says that the grave cloth he was
[1:06:47] trying to get them grave clothes off
[1:06:49] they bind them up you know wrap them up
[1:06:51] real real tight he was trying to get
[1:06:53] those grave clothes off and Jesus said
[1:06:55] said loose him and let him go and when
[1:06:57] he did I believe that he
[1:07:00] probably was
[1:07:02] uh I know he was sit like this well
[1:07:05] praise the
[1:07:09] Lord I'm
[1:07:11] alive I don't know what happened but I'm
[1:07:16] alive no I believe you couldn't stop him
[1:07:18] because remember they were getting ready
[1:07:20] to kill him remember the Bible says that
[1:07:23] when Jesus and him went to a a meal the
[1:07:27] the Pharisees well you know what he went
[1:07:29] sitting there
[1:07:31] going can you ra me from the
[1:07:33] dead no everybody must have knew it cuz
[1:07:36] they was trying to kill him to shut him
[1:07:37] up
[1:07:38] too I mean you read between the lines in
[1:07:41] the Bible and you can see a lot of
[1:07:42] things goes on that that wasn't
[1:07:46] recorded but Lazarus must have struck a
[1:07:48] cord
[1:07:49] somewhere because he had been dead and
[1:07:52] he was restored back right same thing
[1:07:55] with you and I amen we were dead in sin
[1:07:58] trespasses but one day what did God
[1:08:00] do he said I will Resto amen sir that's
[1:08:06] why we've had to go through all this
[1:08:08] people because we fell in the garden
[1:08:11] right and as we fell in the garden that
[1:08:15] put us under a condition that now when
[1:08:17] God came back down to earth and walk
[1:08:20] through the through the uh Trials of
[1:08:23] life just like we do
[1:08:26] all this was going on when Jesus was
[1:08:28] walking on the Earth right don't think
[1:08:30] these writers are new no people are are
[1:08:34] devils the devil was right there when he
[1:08:37] was born trying to kill him at 2 years
[1:08:39] old right devil was trying to destroy
[1:08:42] him even took him at at 30 years old and
[1:08:45] tried to get him to relinquish his
[1:08:47] kingdom and do all these things so if he
[1:08:50] did that to to to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:53] himself you and I are not going to be IM
[1:08:56] I'll promise you
[1:08:58] that but just realize one thing people
[1:09:00] let's be honest with
[1:09:02] ourselves if we can identify ourselves
[1:09:05] somewhere in all
[1:09:08] this then we can do something about it
[1:09:11] but if you just say oh that's a bunch of
[1:09:13] drawings I know that I've got the Holy
[1:09:15] Spirit and and because I got signs and
[1:09:18] wonders
[1:09:22] and right
[1:09:25] uh the Bible even says there when he's
[1:09:27] talking about false Christ he say they
[1:09:28] would do great signs and
[1:09:33] wonders but take this home with him in
[1:09:36] your
[1:09:37] mind and ask God I think the problem is
[1:09:40] that we get settled back sometimes and
[1:09:42] we think
[1:09:43] well we're done we're finished we're in
[1:09:45] the seventh Church age we've got all
[1:09:47] this great Revelation these preachers
[1:09:49] can preach so good and we can feel so
[1:09:52] good and somebody can get us so anointed
[1:09:55] the devil can anoint you right that's
[1:09:58] right to do the wrong thing that's
[1:10:02] right you watch brother
[1:10:05] rown when he's in a prayer line he never
[1:10:08] raises his
[1:10:10] voice he talks to them demons just like
[1:10:12] me and you are talking I've seen people
[1:10:15] in the message Shake people wig off
[1:10:17] their head and I'm not saying that to be
[1:10:20] silly but how's that going to how's that
[1:10:24] going to affect anything
[1:10:26] Jesus never went to the grave of
[1:10:28] Lazareth and started screaming and even
[1:10:31] said father I pray for them around me
[1:10:36] not that I need to pray and that what he
[1:10:39] said he said but for those around me I'm
[1:10:42] going to pray and then he said Lazarus
[1:10:46] come
[1:10:48] forth one day he's he's actually doing
[1:10:50] the same thing for you and I right here
[1:10:53] that's right he's calling your name
[1:10:55] y he saying Donnie yes sir the real you
[1:10:59] come forth right cuz all this is doing
[1:11:02] remember remember brother brand took
[1:11:04] those seals and he rolled them up in a
[1:11:05] roll and he said here's seal number one
[1:11:08] and he pulled it off and it flipped open
[1:11:10] that's exactly what's happening to me
[1:11:11] and you
[1:11:12] right six seals finishes Redemption
[1:11:15] there's Seven Seals not written in the
[1:11:18] Bible it's hi and where is it hi and a
[1:11:22] bunch of people that come to church some
[1:11:25] of you drive four M 4 hours to get
[1:11:32] here some of us can't carry tun in the
[1:11:37] bucket some of us can't play banjo worth
[1:11:40] a
[1:11:45] flip some of us can't preach worth a
[1:11:48] flip I'm not finished
[1:11:53] yet but I'm going to be
[1:11:56] serious God didn't choose you for all
[1:11:58] that that's right he chose you because
[1:12:00] he loved you he chose you because he
[1:12:03] knew in your heart that you'd accept him
[1:12:06] and you'd do better and youd walk in the
[1:12:09] word you do what he says you were what
[1:12:12] an obedient child all this right here
[1:12:15] that something I didn't get to but it's
[1:12:19] obedience right I like Old Samuel he
[1:12:23] told Saul he said said kill them all he
[1:12:27] said don't even leave a sheep Y and
[1:12:30] definitely kill that oneeyed
[1:12:32] King but what did Saul
[1:12:35] do he let that one eye King live Y and
[1:12:39] what Samuel do you said boy these
[1:12:41] prophets are real sweet
[1:12:43] people Samuel walked in there one day
[1:12:46] and he heard the Lambs and he said sa I
[1:12:50] hear the blat in the Sheep right and I
[1:12:52] see that oneeyed King still alive right
[1:12:55] he walked over and he drew Saul's sword
[1:12:57] and he took it and he went cut that
[1:13:00] man's head off right in front of him
[1:13:02] handed the sword back to Saul he said
[1:13:04] Saul it's greater to be obedient yes
[1:13:08] than it is to sacrifice those Lambs see
[1:13:11] Saul I know what Saul was doing he said
[1:13:13] we'll save a few of these to sacrifice
[1:13:17] with but that's not what Samuel told
[1:13:20] him let me get let me get a little
[1:13:23] closer to home that's that's not what
[1:13:25] brother Rand told
[1:13:28] us he said kill him he said hack him up
[1:13:33] and destroy him because if you don't
[1:13:35] destroy the Devil he's going to destroy
[1:13:37] you that's
[1:13:39] right exactly right this is a battle
[1:13:42] people

[1:24:25] I tell the Lord when I walk out that
[1:24:26] door I said look Lord I said this ain't
[1:24:29] for me right this is not for me I
[1:24:33] labored to get this
[1:24:36] sermon but I hope you get something out
[1:24:38] of
[1:24:39] it I've stood here and and had some of
[1:24:42] the worst thoughts had some of the worst
[1:24:44] headache had just some of the most viest
[1:24:46] things come in my head but you know what
[1:24:50] it ain't so
[1:24:52] a it didn't happen that's right it ain't
[1:24:56] in
[1:24:58] me but I say Lord though I be a cast
[1:25:02] away that's what Paul was saying Lord if
[1:25:03] you just cast me in the pit please let
[1:25:06] me help somebody right let me help
[1:25:08] somebody today cuz truly Brother Gary
[1:25:11] knows he's been up here before this is a
[1:25:13] servant's job this is not something that
[1:25:15] makes me no better than you people none
[1:25:18] like we were talking about brother Joe
[1:25:19] Solace got a little dip of it this
[1:25:21] morning he taught Sunday school he said
[1:25:23] man it takes a while to get to get
[1:25:25] everything together I said yeah we spend
[1:25:27] about 6 hours to preach one hour and
[1:25:30] that's about right we spend 6 hours to
[1:25:32] preach one hour you get two sermons you
[1:25:34] you spend about 12 hours getting a
[1:25:36] sermon as far as putting the notes
[1:25:38] together and praying and then say no
[1:25:40] this ain't right this don't go here and
[1:25:42] will this do and and you know will they
[1:25:45] see this or not see this and it's a
[1:25:47] labor so we're we're servants don't
[1:25:49] think anything great of us because the
[1:25:52] only great thing we can do is get
[1:25:53] ourselves out the way and let God use
[1:25:56] our gift I've always wanted to be a
[1:25:58] teacher I've always wanted to teach
[1:25:59] people and I lost that out by not going
[1:26:01] on the school in the natural but maybe I
[1:26:04] can help somebody here in in this in
[1:26:08] this part this realm this realm is
[1:26:09] better than the teacher real outside
[1:26:11] anyway I couldn't teach him little
[1:26:15] he aboutus call
[1:26:18] for he told the people to take the death
[1:26:22] clo right exactly right you know to me
[1:26:25] to me well that's our job today these
[1:26:29] people out there have' got a death cloak
[1:26:31] on
[1:26:33] them you
[1:26:34] know and it's not easy to
[1:26:39] do you said about the man I shared the
[1:26:42] qu a baptism for he says I need to be
[1:26:45] Reb baptized and another guy that I've
[1:26:47] been sharing with for
[1:26:49] years you just can't see it or won't do
[1:26:52] it we got to realize one thing people
[1:26:54] this is not for everybody
[1:26:56] that's I mean that's you want you if you
[1:26:59] have the spirit of God inside of you you
[1:27:00] want everybody to be saved what do you
[1:27:02] think about God Almighty walking on the
[1:27:05] face of the Earth Watching The People
[1:27:08] reject him knowing that if they would
[1:27:10] accept him they would accept salvation
[1:27:13] right and God Almighty himself walking
[1:27:15] on the earth and if they wouldn't accept
[1:27:17] God Almighty and you think they're going
[1:27:18] to accept you all the time no this is
[1:27:22] not for everybody that's what it's
[1:27:23] trying to get those ministers to see and
[1:27:25] I and I know in my heart I want
[1:27:26] everybody to be saved but they just some
[1:27:28] people just not going to be like brother
[1:27:30] dick said you there was a thief on the
[1:27:31] cross on both sides one accepted the
[1:27:33] same both of them heard the same message
[1:27:36] one accepted it one rejected it and
[1:27:39] that's the way it's going to be anytime
[1:27:40] one's going to accept one's going to
[1:27:42] reject you look in in in all your
[1:27:45] journey you see like that that man one
[1:27:46] thing you say hey I need to be baptized
[1:27:49] you talk you can talk to somebody for 5
[1:27:51] years about water baptism and they still
[1:27:52] saying they still ain't going to be
[1:27:53] baptized name Jes
[1:27:55] ch right but it's not for us to
[1:27:57] determine that's right you know just
[1:28:00] preach the word of God and let God deal
[1:28:02] with your heart when you go home
[1:28:05] tomorrow from work and you're tired and
[1:28:07] weary and worn out sit down and just
[1:28:10] kind of kick back a little bit and just

[1:29:31] protect
[1:29:31] you if you got something to do in this
[1:29:34] life he'll do you just like Samuel Dale
[1:29:37] he'll put you on a path and he'll put
[1:29:39] you looking 50 when you're 70 but if you
[1:29:42] don't like I did back 20 years that I
[1:29:44] stayed away from God I didn't do hard
[1:29:46] drugs or anything like that but I was a
[1:29:48] sinner and I did things of the world
[1:29:50] that's why I look 60 instead of 50
[1:29:53] because I didn't take care of myself
[1:29:56] during that
[1:29:58] time honor God Amen he'll honor you he's
[1:30:03] honored that man that man can outwork
