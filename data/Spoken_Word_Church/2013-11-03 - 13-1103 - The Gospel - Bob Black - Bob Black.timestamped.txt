[0:14] go ye into all the world we're reading
[0:17] we just started the recording we're
[0:18] reading Mark
[0:19] 16:15 go ye into all the world and
[0:22] preach the gospel to Every
[0:27] Creature it's interesting how you know
[0:30] I'm not sure maybe how other other
[0:33] Sunday school teachers men would not
[0:35] come up with things to teach on but um
[0:37] you know just you're reading things and
[0:39] and things kind of stand out you know
[0:41] when you're reading the message and just
[0:43] a little scripture will will pop out and
[0:45] this
[0:47] week I I was reading and and this
[0:50] something brother BR said about this
[0:52] scripture just really popped out and um
[0:56] so
[0:58] I I have some quotes I wanted to
[1:02] read and just some things to look
[1:15] at give it a second but
[1:19] um so we we kind of read the background
[1:22] of getting up to this scripture uh that
[1:26] uh Jesus was presented before the uh the
[1:30] government the people that were in in
[1:33] power and they didn't understand what
[1:36] what he was about what um you know pilot
[1:39] said show me what is truth and and we
[1:41] know all the all the stories about the
[1:43] Pharisees and Sadducees that when they
[1:46] when when they were presented with
[1:47] Christ they didn't understand who he was
[1:50] and what it was and maybe
[1:54] um I I think maybe sometimes we don't
[1:57] realize what we have and um
[2:00] so when we when we come up to this
[2:01] scripture Christ is he paid the price
[2:04] for us and he rose from the dead and
[2:07] when uh he was presented to the discip
[2:09] the story was told to the disciples
[2:11] about he's risen from the dead he's not
[2:13] he's not still in the Tomb and they had
[2:15] trouble believe in him and then he he
[2:17] when he finally appeared before him he
[2:19] uh upgraded him and and said um you know
[2:22] told him you
[2:25] know the thing that you have been
[2:28] looking for the thing that have been Pro
[2:30] throughout the whole Old Testament is
[2:32] now before you and you don't understand
[2:34] and he gave them this commission before
[2:37] uh he you know he he left this this last
[2:42] the last message to the disciples and he
[2:46] said unto them go ye into all the world
[2:48] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[2:50] so I I kind of want to take this little
[2:51] scripture and and uh as as my good
[2:55] friend brother Matthew BR and M likes to
[2:57] say that'll
[2:58] preach and uh I I think this this
[3:01] scripture right here will preach you can
[3:03] take this I want to take this scripture
[3:05] up and break it into two three different
[3:07] parts and look at preach the gospel to
[3:11] Every Creature because I I think there's
[3:13] some really powerful things in this
[3:15] little scripture what what this means go
[3:17] you into all the world and preach the
[3:20] gospel to Every
[3:23] Creature so the first thing I want to
[3:25] look at and you know a lot of these
[3:27] little lessons I I kind of um
[3:30] as just the Lord will put something in
[3:32] my in my heart and but then also you
[3:35] know you hear the little questions and
[3:36] things people have and so maybe the
[3:39] first part and um you know I was talking
[3:41] to some of y'all yesterday and and this
[3:43] was already on my heart to speak on but
[3:45] maybe there's a little question about
[3:47] what what is preaching what's the
[3:49] difference between you know when uh
[3:52] maybe there's a question about
[3:55] um well let's let's get into it what
[3:57] what is what is pre is is preaching
[3:59] getting up and and just going through a
[4:00] list of bullet points is is uh you know
[4:03] when brother Dale gets up there is he
[4:05] preaching or is he you know is there a
[4:08] difference between a teacher and a
[4:09] preacher now now the the the last
[4:11] message that Jesus sent that Jesus told
[4:14] to the church to the to the ministry and
[4:16] brother R said this scripture was to the
[4:19] fivefold ministry preach the gospel go
[4:22] you into all the world and preach the
[4:23] gospel not just to like part of the fful
[4:26] ministry not just to you know uh the the
[4:30] ones that sweat a lot and not to the
[4:32] ones that can really put the scripture
[4:34] into place but preaching the gospel is
[4:38] is uh a a gift where you you can get
[4:41] yourself out of the way and let God
[4:43] speak through you so I want to just read
[4:45] some some of these
[4:48] uh some of these things that brother
[4:50] brand said about it and in 1953 whatever
[4:53] he says to you do it now on the platform
[4:56] when the Holy Spirit are
[4:58] speaking
[5:24] thank you
[5:25] that that might be about all I can
[5:28] do now on the platform when the Holy
[5:31] Spirit is speaking and he's speaking
[5:32] through mortal lips he always does I
[5:34] believe these are ministers behind me
[5:35] and Brethren you never preached a sermon
[5:37] in your life the Holy Spirit you never
[5:41] preached a sermon in your life now uh I
[5:44] mean just to be blunt many men do get up
[5:46] and and I remember there was a uh I
[5:49] heard about this this little brother
[5:52] years ago that when a man would get up
[5:53] behind the pit and he'd say something
[5:55] like do you believe that was of the Lord
[5:57] of a man and he' say he just jump right
[5:59] out say that was 100% of man
[6:04] you and uh you know sometimes you uh
[6:09] well that's all I'll say about
[6:12] that he always brother you never
[6:15] preached a sermon in your life real
[6:17] preaching is not not you getting up and
[6:19] saying your own ideas it's God God
[6:22] speaking through you the Holy Spirit
[6:23] preach to You Preach through you a
[6:25] sermon that's right see see that see we
[6:28] don't preach the holy Spirit does the
[6:30] speaking oh we might write out something
[6:32] and read it but that isn't preaching
[6:34] preaching is when inspiration comes and
[6:36] see and it's preached by inspiration and
[6:39] the holy spirit gives the unction now
[6:42] now we a lot of times we get in our
[6:44] minds that that really real preaching is
[6:46] when you get all worked up and and you
[6:49] sweat a lot and that's what I was
[6:50] talking about my last sermon a real
[6:51] Revival doesn't come just because
[6:53] somebody sweating a lot or that's not
[6:55] really anointing the real anointing
[6:57] maybe a lot of times you can't really
[6:59] tell you know I I was watching brother
[7:01] wake down here one time when he was
[7:03] talking about comparing uh downloading
[7:07] an update from the internet and you know
[7:10] the Holy Spirit can speak through him
[7:12] and explain that better than I can well
[7:14] that's my job my day job is is working
[7:17] with the internet but the Holy Spirit by
[7:19] inspiration can speak through him and he
[7:21] can he can tie that together with the
[7:22] word and explain that better than than I
[7:24] could with just technology and brother
[7:27] brother brother Dale would get up uh you
[7:29] know and and break down the word and and
[7:32] just uh put things together in a way
[7:34] that you know maybe not sweating a lot
[7:36] but it's still just as much inspiration
[7:39] as somebody that gets up there rapid
[7:41] fire uh you know folks just F flying off
[7:44] the lip one after another because it's
[7:47] the the Holy Spirit speaking through
[7:50] him uh now we can read something that
[7:54] just doesn't matter but when the Holy
[7:55] Spirit gets a hold of it and it takes it
[7:57] out to the people then something takes a
[7:59] hold of see and that's the Holy Spirit
[8:01] that's not your pastor preaching that's
[8:02] the Holy Spirit preaching in your pastor
[8:04] out to you giving the message and that's
[8:06] when you you know you you like I heard
[8:10] somebody recently saying you you uh
[8:12] you'll think about things during the
[8:13] week and and you'll maybe have a
[8:15] question in your mind and then the Holy
[8:17] Spirit the the minister had even thought
[8:20] wasn't even meditating on that maybe but
[8:22] then the holy spirit will just speak
[8:24] that answer out to you and and that's
[8:26] real
[8:27] Ministry amen and and you know maybe
[8:30] sometimes I'm a poor excuse for one but
[8:31] at least I know what Reon
[8:36] is blam barus 1952 now tonight I'm very
[8:40] Fort a minister with just assume preach
[8:42] about once a day did you know that
[8:44] preaching is harder on you than most any
[8:45] kind of am labor you can do I've seen
[8:48] that estimated and broken down I believe
[8:50] it as compared I think that 20 minutes
[8:52] of preaching under inspiration takes
[8:54] more from your physical body than 8
[8:56] hours of a
[8:57] sledgehammer because is you get getting
[8:59] out of the way and the Holy Spirit
[9:00] getting speaking through you and you
[9:04] know you can you can do the same thing
[9:05] with some some people have gifts where
[9:07] you can get up in front of people and
[9:09] speak but there's also people you know
[9:12] Andrew in the Bible brother said he can
[9:13] get up and pray all night now that's a
[9:15] different kind of gift where God can
[9:17] speak through you in prayer where you
[9:18] get you get uh you you get somebody on
[9:21] your heart and you just go to labor for
[9:23] them and God begins to speak to you like
[9:25] that time brother BR was praying and he
[9:28] heard heard somebody in German speaking
[9:29] he didn't know who it was and it turns
[9:31] out it was the Lord speaking through him
[9:33] in another language calling out for
[9:35] somebody that he didn't even know
[9:36] nothing about it turned out that uh the
[9:38] Lord was speaking to him in
[9:46] prayer and Jesus Christ the same
[9:48] yesterday today and forever I am not a
[9:50] preacher so I just kind of always said I
[9:52] was a spare tire in the spare tire use
[9:54] it when you get a PL I just threw this
[9:55] in there because you know there's a lot
[9:56] of quotes brother say brother says I am
[9:58] not a preacher or you say well okay he
[10:03] you know get something in your head you
[10:05] know but I I was reading where uh you
[10:08] know brother Neville in the church uh
[10:10] some they gave him like a little
[10:11] painting that a little brother in in the
[10:13] church painted and and
[10:15] uh the the little brother had wrote a
[10:17] poem about how he he he's so he's such
[10:20] an humble man he says he says he's not a
[10:22] preacher but when he put him behind the
[10:24] pit and you find out I forget how it
[10:26] goes you'll find out you know the point
[10:28] of it was find out he he can preach
[10:30] better than than a lot of people that
[10:32] say they are and and this next quote
[10:35] kind of confirm this is what we're
[10:36] talking about now the gospel and you
[10:38] know I'm not a preacher I have no
[10:39] education I can't preach I don't claim
[10:41] to be but my preaching is by a gift
[10:43] confirmation of what preachers preach
[10:45] about now he's got
[10:48] uh
[10:50] uh you know many many preachers will
[10:53] just
[10:55] uh he said a minister don't have a right
[10:57] to get behind the poop until he have an
[10:59] experience he knows what he's talking
[11:01] about and I I believe this is kind of
[11:03] what along the lines of what he's saying
[11:05] here I I know when he got over there in
[11:07] India and they were challenging him you
[11:09] know he said bring your worst case I I
[11:11] don't care what it is bring your worst
[11:13] case up and we'll see he's got the
[11:15] confirmation of what preachers just
[11:16] preached about many preachers just get
[11:18] up and just talk about it but he's got
[11:20] the
[11:21] confirmation and and maybe we'll find
[11:24] out when we get into what the gospel is
[11:25] that that's really what the gospel is
[11:27] about so speak to the Rock what what is
[11:31] the gospel let me let me go back a
[11:33] second and talk more about the ministry
[11:35] cuz you know we and and you know really
[11:40] I would never have talked about this
[11:42] unless maybe there was a little question
[11:43] about uh you know you just kind
[11:48] of well you know in in First Corinthians
[11:51] Paul was speaking to the Corinthians and
[11:53] he they they kind of got in their head
[11:55] that this this ministry was better than
[11:57] that Ministry but and Paul told him you
[11:58] know this
[11:59] uh you know I planted a poish water but
[12:03] but who is it that gives the increase
[12:05] it's God that gives the increase and and
[12:08] and I think of it is like the
[12:10] um the the first four books of the Bible
[12:13] ma Matthew Mark Luke and John they they
[12:15] wrote different perspectives of Jesus
[12:18] get the fivefold looks an evangelist
[12:21] come in and say well I I see they're
[12:23] looking at like maybe Matthew looking at
[12:25] from this side I see it this way and
[12:28] another one come in oh but have you seen
[12:30] it this way kind of turn around and look
[12:31] at it from this direction and you once
[12:34] you get all the different five folds
[12:36] then you can see a better picture of
[12:38] what you really
[12:40] um you really what Christ is all
[12:44] about so what is the
[12:48] gospel go you into into all the world
[12:51] and preach the gospel to every creature
[12:54] and and you know you can break down look
[12:57] at it from a technical perspective the
[12:58] go goel it it comes from this Greek word
[13:02] yalon that the literal if if you took if
[13:06] you took that it broke it up into two
[13:07] parts in the Old English they they made
[13:09] this this name they call it Goat spell
[13:13] which literally means uh good news so
[13:17] that's where you know you hear the
[13:18] gospel is the good news the good news of
[13:21] of uh you know Jesus died and and rose
[13:24] from the dead and paid for our sins and
[13:26] paid the price and you know I I I was
[13:30] thinking about the five4 ministry is
[13:32] kind of like
[13:33] salesman and I think a lot a lot of
[13:35] times you know when you're talking to
[13:36] people at work or whatever you you maybe
[13:39] get in your head a lot of times that
[13:41] this is hard to sell but it shouldn't be
[13:43] it sells itself you don't have to work
[13:46] anything up to uh convince somebody or
[13:49] um just just lay it in front of them
[13:51] because uh you know as easy as it is to
[13:54] sell some people just don't want it it
[13:57] doesn't take a slicked up S somebody
[13:59] that can can you know lay everything
[14:01] down just uh it's as easy to sell as he
[14:05] he's risen from the dead you know Christ
[14:07] said lo I with you always those things
[14:10] should should just cause us all to be
[14:12] burning in our heart to have a stronger
[14:14] desire you know when the first time you
[14:16] heard the word think about maybe U you
[14:18] know this this there's a prophet you
[14:21] know something it didn't take maybe uh
[14:24] well maybe some of us did take beat us
[14:26] upside the head but uh you know it it it
[14:29] sells
[14:31] itself and and the traditional
[14:33] explanation of the Gospel is it's it's
[14:36] just the teaching of Jesus Christ that
[14:40] just and whenever you put the word just
[14:42] in there that uh that should be a red
[14:43] flag cuz it's not just the teaching out
[14:47] the you know the word had to be sewn
[14:50] first and then it comes to life that's
[14:52] right it's not just the teaching and so
[14:55] let's look at some
[14:57] quotes uh speak to the Rock 1953 now the
[15:00] gospel is not allog together the word
[15:02] this is the word of God and all things
[15:04] must be based upon this word if it isn't
[15:06] it isn't true this is but Jesus said go
[15:08] you in all the world and preach the
[15:09] gospel to Every Creature now he did not
[15:11] say teach the word he said preach the
[15:13] gospel because teaching the word is part
[15:16] of preaching the gospel preaching the
[15:18] gospel includes teaching the word he's
[15:21] not saying the gospel doesn't include
[15:22] teaching the word teaching the word is
[15:24] part of it so the gospel consists more
[15:26] than teaching the word for Paul
[15:28] confirming said the gospel came to us
[15:29] not in word only but through Power
[15:32] demonstrations of the holy spirit will
[15:33] come and demonstrate the gospel bring
[15:35] the word to a living
[15:37] reality and earnestly contending for the
[15:39] faith that was once delivered to the
[15:40] Saints he said
[15:43] um we've had plenty of passing out
[15:45] tracks and theology around the world but
[15:47] the gospel is not the Bible all together
[15:49] the Bible said Paul said the gospel came
[15:51] to us not in word only but through Power
[15:53] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost then
[15:55] when Jesus said go into all the world
[15:57] and preach the gospel Every Creature
[15:59] then he meant go into all the world and
[16:01] demonstrate the power of God to every
[16:04] creature and you know uh
[16:08] you as I was studying on this you know I
[16:11] was telling some of you yesterday
[16:12] morning we got a call that Monica's mama
[16:14] had been put in the hospital with uh
[16:16] they told her she had uh the cancer came
[16:19] back and and uh and of course later on
[16:23] the day uh we found out the doctors
[16:25] would be in presumptions they had run no
[16:27] test or anything were just saying that
[16:29] she had cancer when they had done done
[16:30] any test or anything but you know when
[16:33] you when you come upon situations in
[16:35] life where you know somebody's sick or
[16:37] um uh and I really got thinking brother
[16:41] me and brother Aaron and brother Joe all
[16:43] just went up to brother Tim hes for the
[16:45] the the meetings and and uh me and
[16:48] brother Aaron went up to stand in the
[16:50] prayer line and and you know there's
[16:53] people coming through that will really
[16:55] have evil spirits on them and you can't
[16:57] go into the prayer line brother Tim he
[16:59] was to all Minister for the prayer line
[17:01] if any of you ministers doubt that you
[17:03] have the Holy Ghost you know go sit down
[17:05] because you can't come up there and say
[17:07] well I I I'm going to I know what
[17:10] brother Dale said about the Seven Seals
[17:13] I know what uh brother brand I I read
[17:15] the church a book you can't come up
[17:17] there with just a letter but it's got to
[17:18] be a living gospel and that's what the
[17:21] gospel is not just the letter of the law
[17:24] on the page but a living reality in your
[17:26] life something living in you
[17:29] that something uh something alive and
[17:32] it's is not something it's not myself
[17:34] but it's the power of God in your
[17:37] life and uh Paul I was reading in
[17:40] Colossians 1:23 this
[17:43] is well you know brother Dell says that
[17:46] uh he when I started preaching he said
[17:48] every Minister needs their own scripture
[17:50] to preach from him and brother Wade's
[17:52] got one mine is Colossians 1:
[17:57] 12627 and Colossians 1:23 says if you
[18:00] continue in the faith grounded and
[18:03] settled and be not moved away from the
[18:04] hope of the Gospel which he have heard
[18:08] the hope of the Gospel which is not just
[18:10] a letter of the law but a living
[18:12] reality and which was preached to every
[18:15] creature which is under Heaven whereof I
[18:18] Paul and made a Ministry now I like this
[18:21] because he's he's saying the the
[18:23] commission from Christ was to go and
[18:25] preach the gospel to every creature and
[18:27] Paul say and I've done that I have not
[18:30] just preached it I I'm not just not just
[18:33] taught it but I have lived it out it's
[18:36] it living reality I you lay hands on the
[18:38] sick and they shall recover and if you
[18:40] read on further further down it's it's
[18:43] uh the power of God in your life and
[18:44] when you uh because signs and wond
[18:48] there's a promise that signs and wonders
[18:50] shall follow them that believe and I'm
[18:52] not say these things to issue a
[18:54] challenge or anything but I'm saying it
[18:55] to maybe build your faith up that that
[18:59] this is supposed to be in the Christian
[19:02] Life and I I really believe that a
[19:05] Christian cannot help but have signs and
[19:08] W wonders fall in because you know just
[19:10] through your daily life when you forget
[19:12] your keys uh you ask God to show you
[19:15] your keys to find things for just little
[19:17] things like that when you're uh like I
[19:19] was talking about walking from the
[19:20] subway and the spirit of God just comes
[19:22] down and and uh you know somebody beside
[19:25] me starts shouting and glorifying God
[19:27] just little things throughout the day
[19:29] because it's not just teaching it's not
[19:32] just the letter of the law but it's
[19:33] something a li in
[19:36] you and and just continue on that last
[19:39] quote I was reading so it's not just a
[19:40] ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a
[19:42] real living reality of the resurrection
[19:44] of Jesus Christ living among
[19:47] men the angel of the Lord 1951 paragraph
[19:51] E11 our ministry has changed it over and
[19:53] said oh there's a real believer I tell
[19:55] you he loves the Lord and he goes to
[19:56] church every Sunday and he pays is DED
[19:58] to the church and he treats his neighbor
[20:00] right that's just moral act the holy
[20:03] spirit in the man demonstrates the power
[20:04] of the supernatural what makes him a
[20:07] Believer it's God vindicating that he is
[20:09] a Believer Jesus said these not them the
[20:12] these shines shall follow them that
[20:14] believe and you know this is a real
[20:16] simple message but it tie it does tie
[20:18] together with it ties together with
[20:20] brother Wan teaching the statute of
[20:22] perfect man because a statute of a
[20:23] perfect man is the gospel it's the
[20:26] gospel that has been by the way will lay
[20:28] it down and explain it and put uh put it
[20:31] all out teach it by inspiration and then
[20:33] let the Holy Spirit Come and Quicken it
[20:35] and bring it to life because God said
[20:37] brother R said that the word is like an
[20:39] electric wire that it provides a conduit
[20:43] for the spirit to come behind it and
[20:44] Quicken it and bring it to life he said
[20:46] first the word went out in the beginning
[20:48] the word went out and then the Spirit
[20:50] came behind it to bring it to life and
[20:52] you can you can Bank on it if you when
[20:54] when the ministry gets up behind the
[20:56] pullit and preaches the word if it's the
[20:58] true where the spirit will come behind
[20:59] it and bring to life that's why you can
[21:02] you you uh after the after the you know
[21:05] we were talking about many churches
[21:07] don't have alter calls or uh or they
[21:10] don't lay hands on the Seck anymore
[21:13] but but that I'm thankful that we go to
[21:17] a church that allows the opportunity for
[21:19] the spirit to come behind that word and
[21:21] you can come up and and if you have a
[21:22] need in your life or something something
[21:24] is not right you come up and get the
[21:26] elders to lay hands on you and that word
[21:28] that has been preached becomes quickened
[21:30] and the go that becomes the gospel being
[21:32] preached not just being taught but the
[21:35] gospel being live and Made
[21:38] Alive
[21:41] good now this this
[21:45] quote I I believe it's difficult to
[21:47] understand this quote without going to
[21:49] Isaiah chapter 66 y y'all turn with me
[21:53] to
[21:55] Isaiah chapter 66
[22:00] and and I think this kind of Falls in
[22:01] line with what brother brother Dale has
[22:03] been teaching on about the serpent seed
[22:05] and the what happened in the
[22:11] garden the the gospel is uh is it's not
[22:15] just letters on the page and and many
[22:17] times we we'll uh you know we try to
[22:20] figure things out and um if you try to
[22:24] figure it out then uh if if the if the
[22:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the birth
[22:29] of the word and you seow a corruptible
[22:33] seed that has been hybrid with your own
[22:36] ideas and how how can that come to life
[22:38] and produce the Original Seed first the
[22:40] the true the uh unhate seed has to be
[22:45] sow you know that's why uh when when God
[22:48] was trying to speak to balam and balum
[22:50] didn't understand it so he had to speak
[22:52] to him so through an
[22:57] H is pure bread and that's the only way
[23:00] he get to Baum so he had to speak to him
[23:02] through through something that wasn't
[23:04] hybrid now in Isaiah chapter
[23:09] 66
[23:12] oh let's see yeah let's start about
[23:15] verse 15 you know brother talked about
[23:17] how Isaiah is like a mirrors the Bible
[23:20] there's 66 books in the Bible in 66
[23:22] chapters in Isaiah and this last chapter
[23:25] gets gets into talking about how the
[23:27] restoration of Israel and and how God's
[23:29] going to purge it by fire and Purge all
[23:31] the things that shouldn't be shouldn't
[23:33] be there just like in your life how he's
[23:35] by the holy baptism the holy ghost that
[23:37] that his that consuming fire comes into
[23:39] your life and cleanses out everything
[23:40] that's not supposed to be there so let's
[23:42] start about Isaiah chapter 66 verse1 15
[23:45] for behold the Lord will come with fire
[23:48] how about that and with his chariots
[23:50] like a whirlwind to render his anger
[23:52] with Fury and his rebuke with flames of
[23:54] fire for by fire and by his sword will
[23:57] the Lord plead with with All Flesh and
[23:58] the slain of the Lord shall be many they
[24:01] that sanctify themselves and purify
[24:03] themselves where in the garden behind
[24:06] one tree in the midst eating swine's
[24:09] flesh and the Abomination and the mouth
[24:10] shall be consumed together sayeth the
[24:12] Lord because now this is uh this is
[24:15] talking about the people that that wrap
[24:17] their say it like this wrap their arms
[24:18] around the tree of knowledge I'm going
[24:20] to figure it out I'm going to prove that
[24:22] I'm right by doing things that God's
[24:24] word does not allow I'm going to prove
[24:27] that uh wrap their arms around the tree
[24:29] of knowledge and prove by their own
[24:31] mental conception that they're okay with
[24:33] you know cutting their hair and or just
[24:35] just an example do doing things that
[24:37] God's word clearly if you have a uh a
[24:40] spiritual mind clearly disallows and
[24:43] that's what
[24:46] uh yeah this is that's what this this
[24:48] this quote is talking about 1963 the
[24:51] token Believers should be separating the
[24:53] things from the things of the world the
[24:54] cares of the world that's the reason I
[24:56] hammer at women and so forth the way I
[24:58] have and then separate yourselves from
[25:00] these TV programs separate yourselves
[25:02] from this Hollywood evangelism come back
[25:04] to deepness and sincerity we stand in
[25:06] the pullit and jump up and down and
[25:07] laugh and holler and carry on women
[25:10] dance over the floors clothes on them
[25:11] real skin tight and all kinds of jewelry
[25:13] and stuff hanging on with Bob here that
[25:16] some of them will make up on and they
[25:17] got an intellectual Pastor there a
[25:19] preacher that can put the word together
[25:21] so perfect that isn't it we don't come
[25:23] to the altar of God laughing carrying on
[25:25] and cutting up we come to the altar with
[25:27] sincerity and deepness because there we
[25:29] are dying now you read this quote and
[25:33] talk about an intellectual Pastor there
[25:35] preacher that can put the word together
[25:36] so perfect that's not talking about our
[25:38] pastor that's talking about somebody
[25:40] that will put their arms around the tree
[25:42] of knowledge and try to put it together
[25:44] in a way that by their own mental
[25:46] intellect by their own knowledge and try
[25:48] to try to uh prove things that aren't
[25:51] there and that's what the denominations
[25:53] do today is they'll uh uh form up get in
[25:57] their own
[25:58] form form denominations around their own
[26:00] ideas and get away from God's word and
[26:02] say we're right because we've got a
[26:04] little building we' got a little
[26:05] organization or whatever
[26:07] but when Paul heard the word he
[26:11] separated himself and Paul put the word
[26:14] together not like in Isaiah 66 but he
[26:17] put together the word together like a
[26:19] real preacher with an anointing of the
[26:20] holy spirit that could put together the
[26:22] word together and say well uh here's
[26:25] what really happened with Abraham and s
[26:28] and here's you know like Abel where
[26:30] where does it say that Abel uh how his
[26:34] sacrifice was consumed but the Bible
[26:35] does say it it says it all through the
[26:37] scripture where does the bible say what
[26:39] the seventh seal is but it does say it
[26:41] it does say it all all through the
[26:43] scripture and it it it Paul never said
[26:47] spoke things that weren't written in the
[26:49] scripture but he was able by the
[26:51] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to put it
[26:52] all together and and and and say things
[26:55] that only God uh Only God Can reveal no
[26:59] man can do like Isaiah that's that's
[27:01] what Isaiah 66:17 is talking about
[27:04] trying to put it together by your own
[27:08] ideas led by the Holy Spirit it never
[27:10] come to us through word only the word
[27:12] got to be quickened and made alive in
[27:14] the demonstration of the power of the
[27:15] Holy Ghost then if you call that the
[27:17] greater things surely you can do the
[27:18] lesser things go heal the sick I'm just
[27:21] kind of trying to scam through some of
[27:22] these quotes that we got about three
[27:24] more minutes uh the the gospel is the
[27:27] sign of the Living God moving among the
[27:31] people and then just to finish up here
[27:34] every creature now this this is just so
[27:37] beautiful because a lot of people say
[27:40] you know like brother Dale has been
[27:40] saying about how many people say you
[27:43] shouldn't preach to uh to people that
[27:46] you know are predestinated according to
[27:48] their understanding of what
[27:49] predestination is and I remember hearing
[27:52] uh years ago about people that would say
[27:54] I'm afraid my children are serpent seed
[27:56] and you get all the these ideas in your
[27:58] head that you know that uh but you know
[28:01] by my maybe my kids there's no way for
[28:03] them to be saved but we know that uh the
[28:07] God's word doesn't teach that if if you
[28:09] have a a spiritual you know see things
[28:12] the way that God wants us to see but
[28:17] um so the the gospel is not just preach
[28:20] to just a special group of people it's
[28:22] supposed to be preached to every
[28:24] creature and you say okay well we're
[28:26] going to preach to the Lost and to the
[28:27] saved but the go the Bible says the
[28:30] preaches to Every Creature every
[28:33] creature on Earth because remember if
[28:35] you go all the way back to the beginning
[28:37] Adam if if the gospel is the word being
[28:40] made manifest in the power and
[28:42] demonstration of the spirit Adam uh now
[28:45] I don't have a quote for this so y'all
[28:47] you you know you take it or leave it but
[28:48] Adam moved the the trees and the rivers
[28:52] and the Animals by the power of the
[28:55] spirit and and I believe that's that's
[28:56] preaching to go gospel the word came
[28:58] from forth from Adam's mouth and that's
[29:01] preaching the gospel right there every
[29:03] creature you believe that means that
[29:05] brother R said in in five definite
[29:07] identifications of the True Church of
[29:08] the Living God 1960 I seen God baffle a
[29:10] bull one day right I seen him call horn
[29:13] that's not distinct I've seen him raised
[29:15] up an apostle and that been laying dead
[29:17] all night every creature the gospel will
[29:19] take effect upon anything that you asked
[29:22] now that's that's good right there I
[29:24] remember one one time I I we had a
[29:26] little this is the before the dog we had
[29:28] now but it ran out we had a little dog
[29:30] that ran out in the road got hit by a
[29:31] car and all the little kitties uh came
[29:35] just laid hands on the little dog it got
[29:37] smacked by that car and it they they um
[29:40] the neighbor ended up taking it to the
[29:42] vet but there was nothing wrong with
[29:44] that little dog because the gospel had
[29:47] been preached to that little dog now you
[29:49] think about a little a little animal
[29:50] like a little fishy that's raised from
[29:52] the dead now what will the gospel do to
[29:54] if it'll do that to a little animal what
[29:56] will the gospel do to
[29:59] you the gospel will take effect upon
[30:02] anything that you ask you say that's
[30:03] wrong brother Brown it isn't wrong so
[30:06] we'll stop right there amen that's the
[30:13] gospel
