TRANSCRIPT
========================================
everybody hope everybody's doing okay yeah just for the record I'm not going to Afghanistan for three years no lady messed up my haircut so yeah yeah there's nothing the thing was it was a man's barbershop the place of the name of the place of demands demands place man's room and it all women in there it's not like man there's everything's manly I mean they got deer antlers coming from the wall everything but it was all women so she thought you needed that well I was wanting to go for a fade but not this much of a face and she she I showed her a picture and she's like well we can do something similar and there but but she was doing am i I was thinking oh she's doing what the pictures doing what time I looked in the mirror she had already gone all right let's let's continue with the speaking about the kingdom of God and also I wanted to uh I wanted to apologize lately the last two services or the last two Sunday School lessons I've been saying 3 2 1 1 2 3 what it's bothering me and some people some people just cuz I use the word heck so that's not that I just this just to me it wasn't anything bad but I know it could be bad for some people so I just wanted to apologize for that so maybe it's better just when the world is bothering me all right so we're speaking about the kingdom of God and we we were reading this Sunday this is where we kind of stopped that we read Romans chapter 14 and and so the kingdom of God so we're speaking about is the kingdom got external because we know it's not an external thing even though people make it out to be an external thing right but that's all the kingdom of God is so we read Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink these are external things your flesh your body means meat and drink right but that's why I think God is just above it's not meat and drink or physical things but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's right that's the key point because without the holy ghost there's no kingdom of God yes right not for the with without without the Holy Ghost there's no peace there's no joy there's no true joy and peace and righteousness it's all temporary and how many of us you know we get caught up and you get caught up with the things of this world and you think this will give me pleasure this will give me pleasure this will give me pleasure and it's only temporary so all right so let's let's read these quotes brother Branham said in a message the token God's God's blood bound promises makes us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world you don't have to dress different anybody can dress different you have to be on the inside different the life is on the inside not dressing wearing the kingdom of God is not meat and drink or wearing of apparel but it's the long-suffering goodness generalizations in the Holy Ghost so ability brother Brendan the brother Brendan think it was all about hair and dress and all that stuff like a lot of people in the message may get off the beat that's part of it but the thing is is that but you don't have to tell the true point again Christian Oh sister or brother for that sake to dress properly the Holy Ghost in them will teach him how to because he's all about modesty right amen that's why we different with the Baptist Methodist so-called Calvinists they think of people but Calvinism is right then we're going to come over on the Armenian side what did they do it works what's the holiness groups works bless God I'll let my hair grow out the women and oh praise God I won't even wear a short sleeve shirt the man will and so forth like that that has nothing to do with the kingdom others Rama says no sir you can let your hair grow long you can wear dresses whatever you want to or you can do this that or the other and they won't have nothing at all to do with it you're not safe because of your clothes if so God would just have made some patterns of such everybody would just the brother Dale would just give out patterns for everybody to dress exactly alike and that's not Jesus wouldn't have have to die it was all about dressing him in my long hair and all that right right you're safe because that God saved you by grace and you do these things just an appreciation for common decency will tell you that you do those things in a preacher many men it's a pretty clear alright so now we're going to speak about being not far from the kingdom of God now this is not exactly in the kingdom of God but but you're not far from the kingdom of God I will read here mark chapter 12 and one of the scribes came and haven't heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered said the first of all the commandments is hear o Israel the Lord God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself no matter how annoying your neighbor I'm not talking about just your next-door neighbor I'm talking about your neighbor at church yeah there is none other commandment greater than these and the scribe said unto Him well master thou has said the truth not to know this while he replies and describes how until well master thou has said the truth so he was agreeing with the word right for there is one God and there is none other but he so he wasn't disputing what Jesus was saying was correct he was agreeing with what Jesus was saying Jesus being the word he was agreeing with the word right and Jesus bringing the word agreeing with the word it was always so in verse 33 and to love him with all the heart and he continues added to this to this the scrub and with to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and watch what these replies and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto Him thou art not far from the kingdom of God Ava amen now he wasn't in the kingdom of God right you know he had they had the scribes that the scribes knew that led the letter mm-hmm back and forth I mean they knew really well yes but that wasn't part of the kingdom although some a lot of them would think you know I know this word I know this by the letter but I'm not about just knowing the letter it's about knowing the life amen behind a letter amen and so jesus answered him because he agreed with that word you know he was he said are not far from the kingdom of God he he didn't take the the attitude like a lot of the other Pharisees and the people who would contradict Jesus you know and who was against Jesus he saw that this man had a head of country you know type of spirit you know like a more humble type spirit moon he said that were not far from the kingdom of God now brother Ben says here look I know this is kind of long but just bear with me and the letter not the little nurse came in to the bedside where I was reading the Bible and she was a new nurse on the floor she said how do you do she said I believe that your Reverend Branham here for a physical checkup I said I am and she said may I rub your back make you feel a little better with the alcohol and I said you may do it and while she was rubbing on my back she said what denomination of church do you belong to now people probably already stumbled around that first point company where he was standing he took it and she's a nurse you know woman you know but that's fine that that's okay again remember what's bad for you may not be back for another forever system you see what I'm saying hi brother Brenda knew where he was standing right all right just I was just wanted I'll take that back to her come on that Sunday mmm and while she was running long back she said what denomination of church do you belong to and said oh I belong to the oldest denomination there is and she said what denomination is that I said it's the one that was organized before the world was ever organized oh she said what I don't know I don't believe I know just that she said I belong to a certain church is that organization I said no ma'am that was only about 200 years ago that organization but this organization was started when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind and she just stopped rubbing my back and I was stopped a little over this way so the lady could rub it she was from near cordon down here and we got to talking and she said sir now this how much she replied sir I've always believed that if God was ever God he still got today just like he was in the old days she said though my church flatly denies that but I believe that is the truth now compared to what that that scribe my tech scribe replied to to Jesus you see she was agreeing with what brother Branham was saying and brother and sis and I said you're not far from the kingdom of God young woman she said if he ever was a healer isn't he still healing I said he most certainly is my sister so I'm just showing you these that your approach to the word so I'm gonna Center out here the way he approaches the word the you know determines how close he is or she the kingdom of God you know that's very important your attitude towards the word bless God I won't believe I don't believe that well there's no blessing for you then you're not close to the kingdom of God and you just stomp out another example the day after our meetings at Phoenix there's a little lady came up and said brother Branham since the meeting said I let my hair grow I said you're not far from the kingdom now she said my sister had a wheelbarrow full of these shorts and things she was going to throw them in the garbage can in the next sister come along and got them and said she wasn't finished with those things I said so I said that's all right I believe the church will come back to its feet someday keeps going like that it'll get all right I met a man not long ago that said why don't you leave off those women said well I don't know he said people regard you as a prophet I said I'm not he said but they regard me that why don't you teach them these things I received these spiritual gifts I said how can you teach them out or when they won't believe their ABCs you know what ABC stands for all right list that's the first ABCs lets them learn how to do and we'll teach them something with it you know and so when we get that why we're coming pretty close to the king okay so there's a sister here that because she saw something she wanted to get closer amen to the Lord she did something and might I might not been the new birth you see what I'm saying but because she said brother Branham I was convicted by that I let my hair he said never sir you're not parking the kingdom but that's not the new birth right that's not that's not that that doesn't mean that the sister was safe right but she might have still needed the new birth but she was too far from the kingdom and that's one here now I'm not a de a latter-day I'm just your brother I don't care whether your first reign second ring middle reign all rain or no rain it don't make these difference to me I love you just the same and we are brothers he said well said all this big church that our best members went over there I said they did I said what they go for us said that man came over and pulled him away dying to save us goes down now that's right I don't care if he don't know his ABCs or split peas from coffee let me tell you brother as long as he knows Jesus Christ he may talk through his nose and holler and now here he was speaking to up to a brother and this is what he was telling me I'd rather have that than all the phd's of denominational person and everything as I say I want to know God in the power of his resurrection that's right he said I guess you're about right this is what the person would plug back to brother Brown so program said you're not far from the kingdom now all right so you can you can be close to the kingdom but not in the king or in this case is the kingdom of God you see and then so easy for us as as as as as humans you know to to think that because this has happening in my life or that I'm going through this that I must be in the kingdom I must being in the kingdom but you have to be born but everything human spirit amen praise God now you know brother grandpa brother Dale he's been speaking about the new birth so how do you enter it into this kingdom John chapter 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him now you take you take the attitude that Nicodemus had towards Jesus could you say that he was close to the kingdom of God I believe he was i standing right in front of the kingdom absolutely because of the way he was approached I mean he he said no man can do these miracles God be with him right right and jesus answered insulting him he said you know he kind of didn't regard what he said that right there but he said Jesus and something fairly rare I sent to thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and when you look at that word see it means to understand there's different different different uh I meant to put them here on the slide but different definitions for and things are very interesting to see to understand - you have expound expounding to you you know just different things so except a man be born again I meant so without the newborn birth you can't even understand the word you can probe at it you can put this scripture here with this scripture here and and you may understand it intellectually and I've always said this Malachi 4 came you know not to turn the heads but to turn the hearts like a lot of people have had their heads turned but not their hearts that's the reason why you see people leaving their head they always intellectual you know things that you know you can know this message intellectually you can know the Word of God intellectually but that has nothing to do with the universe it's got to be a revelation is right now a man mm-hmm it's got to be a revelation team you know when I when I came to the Lord and when I came to this messaging I really appreciate you know the series that brother Dale's been bringing upstairs because it's led me on about you but it's let me looked at my life at what I've experienced in the last 15 20 almost 20 years that I've been in this message and in kind of pinpoint where I was born again where were my salvation took place before I reach this statue of the perfect man and I had never I knew that I experienced those things but I never could pinpoint it till brother down I just think I don't know about you you might think oh brother those you know it's just boring or dug into believer that's not boring anymore no more of that Kingdom a man they could demon said unto Him how can a man be born when he is old so Nicodemus is thinking that he's talking about natural things can he enter into the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now up here he says that man cannot even see the key man of God here he's I mean I cannot even enter into the kingdom of God right that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit my will not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit amen praise God so Jesus made it clear that in order for you to even and see or enter the kingdom of God you must be born again right and I know we do we know all these things but sometimes in our human thinking we think we could just kind of bypass some things just kind of take shortcuts you know and it doesn't work that way does anybody have any questions or anything is the only revelation that is in I don't think so is that considered a revelation I mean yeah they born again I believe so yeah I mean especially if you I mean because what the new birth it can be different for everybody you see I mean it I has to be by the word but a specific revelation that was specific to you you see so you know ma I believe I was born again in Colombia South America reading the message across the mystery of God revealed I believe I was the surface beginning of money birth and so but then to other people and then of course you know to other people who came through Pentecost you know their new birth was a physical experience right right yeah the way I think what she's trying to say it's gonna break and get a revelation if you don't say you're not warning you you can the other knowledge because at 14 years old I had a knowledge of my brother Brennan said it was just you could read and see that it was an apple you could read and see it and what an Father Son Holy Ones baptism well the true revelation is though when it takes that and it's like that roman candle issued you're saying you know we just because him prophet no eternal hell no father you know that's just a repeat of what unit in what you read physically but when I was born again in 98 all that came alive if it wasn't dead letter anymore because what it was doing even though I realize what it was it was condemning me Yeah right it was condemning me this is what was condemning me but the true revelation when I got the new birth the true revelation came is what I had held all those years came right back up just like the examples they listen to what Jesus said no they didn't help they weren't privy to have a book to have an end they just had to go by their memory of what they heard for three and a half years but on the neighbors and they were sinners but on that day of Pentecost when you guys save their soul changed them all that came back that good word that was on the pages I am Alive right now that was a revelation so you can have a knowledge and be a sinner that's what's happening now with these people that are preaching been preaching the message for thirty years right and now good night and just say it was wrong and say now they can't they couldn't have been born again now they could have been in the same spot condition and now the Holy Ghost annoying I probably have to worry about never worry about an anointing you feel an anointing and that you're born again even brother Branham Warner so parents but anointing ones at the end time is the true anointing of the Holy Ghost well now by knowing it'll hold of those will help you preach the word but your data insides don't always agree with the word I tried but then B no that's Olaf they never they were centers I think they're centers now if it wasn't there fenders now yeah they let that unclean spirit go out and then come right back make them religious but somewhere down the line some brother Dale gonna sit somewhere down the line you're gonna meet that one checkpoint that you can't get through and when you don't meet that J point then they go off and and don't just go into false doctrine they completely deny the message and do often you know out the world whatever else so you know one thing for sure they didn't have that Kingdom in their soul they might have walked in they might've walked close like Nicodemus you know sir and Jesus man said you're not far from the kingdom but now that didn't mean any born again even who wasn't when Paul went up against them what was his name we need the one it says you almost convert me Paul a great breakfast a great was a Jew Paul new vessel he addressed the Griffith Gribble of the Jew he knew all the Jewish tradition and then when Paul expounded them on what God had done for him I'm grateful said Paul you almost convert me Caldwell you know Paul could have said you're not far from the kingdom Michael he did everything the Jewish people told him if you know the tradition don't you today and that's the way we are we we're just traditionalist until the good morning that's enough we just have a tradition a message tradition long hair like you just say long hair long dress don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that so a sinner cannot read the word to get revelation but the sinner can can read the word and get it an anointing but until they're born again they know they don't get it true that roman candle firing off revelation that all this comes together this yes that's true appreciate you clearing that up don't wait because no no I mean it thank you no you're right no not my turn but not because I mean when you look at the disciples when they went up and received that word that Jesus spoke to them came alive there in the upper room and then what did Peter start doing started putting word with word hey you know putting the word together and not only that but it gave them a boldness to you'll go out they were scared in the upper room it's right someone that may want to go out because they were afraid of the actions of Jews outside of what they would do but they never let the boldness and so the new birth will change you right right at the same time I think a a sinner like you said where the weight can be sanctified sure can be they can they can clean themselves up there are some there are some people out here in this world that have just as a longer hair some of the and dress even nicer and more cleaner than but uh you know that doesn't mean that there have the new Barbie stands right just cleaned up sinners right now alright so the word is both water and spirit we'll just touch on this here his home and Ephesians chapter five verse twenty six husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word and now this is this is going back to what Jesus said if except a man be born of water and of the Spirit right the water in the spirit is both the same thing it's the Word of God right and and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word amen John 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so Jesus clearly you know telling us that his words are spirit and they are life and they were watched by the watch so wherever you see a lot of places in the scripture where you see water and spirit you know wherever you see the water you usually see the spirit there or a spirit and water all tied together amen because you know you look at you look at a physical birth you know and there has to be water right and then that in that that water you know when it breaks that means of birth is taking place right wife is looking at me right now but we had an experience with Bella seen Christine we that we decided to use a midwife for both of our children and and say it was real as as real good no it was no she wasn't asleep I witnessed sleep I was there helping and and when we got there to the to that to that up to the birthing place the the the lady the Midwife said all right Lewis this things about to burst and just as soon as she said that mean that water burst it got all over Marla but you need to have both that water and that spirit that drive a man that that word needs to be there and so when you have a physical birth that water is there it needs to burst it needs to break open a meant to give way up to to to the life amen once the baby is born but you see once the baby comes out then the the breath of life can come into it right and and then you know the actual birth is it's the birth right you know that's the new birth right but then it's like brother Dale said says you know then the crying and all that that takes place the emotion that can take place after and then it's justified it's good because I don't know of a Christian who hasn't received any bird that hasn't experienced an emotional time in their life doesn't necessarily mean that you spoke in tongues and prophesied and run around the church and all that and all that is very good and if the Lord deals with you way you need to continue having the Lord deal with you that way because it helps us with some of us starchy people right and but you know when but I don't know of a Christian who hasn't got down to cry crying before the Lord and asking that and one in desire more variety and not fully understand what's going on in his or her life and say lord please explain to me and show me you know what it is and just crying and travailing for God right but but at the sinner you know the sinner just you know cries and all that - I see asking the Lord to forgive them you see but if that crown isn't the new birth all right man so John 664 case of Jesus continued sin but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not minutia pretreatments and he said therefore sound to you that no man come can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father a man in that place I said no man can come to me unless the father draws him first from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more now I wanted to leave this here because those disciples see Jesus have more than motorcycle yet cetera and all of them heard word only 12 stayed with him right after Jesus has preached food to the to the people if you don't drink my flesh to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and these in these up these other 70 they thought this thing is too hard for us to understand so they walked away from it and and so the verse 16 Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal ask them are you gonna go to and and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God so not just believe but they were sure that I put that didn't state that me why that was in there no that's right they can be born again thank you truck that was confirmed in them at in the in the upper room I mean that was really I mean it was not just Jesus with them but it was Jesus in the man amen yeah he jesus answered them have not I chosen you twelve and one of you doesn't just have a devil but is it that way we know he's talking about Judas he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he was the one she betrayed being one of the twelve amen so you can I mean these people right here these 70 disciples like just like but message believers that come to the message and he'll be there for three five six seven ten years 15 years in them but then almost suddens I just they'll hear something something that you know that they come out sail along or something so I'll say one thing one thing one thing one phrase so maybe it's a brief something and they just can't get it they leave or they're looking for something otherwise or they're looking for something and just to give em an excuse because some people don't want to give up certain lifestyle certain things in their life and so they'll take they'll use and something like this to justifiable like I came in you know I'm gonna continue this life moveable Saints the word attains you from the inside out Israel amen that's right you may still have you may still be struggling right mr. Luke because we're still in this flesh we're still pressing amen into this kingdom right we're still pressing because this thing is not born again but the desire of not wanting to is any but right now whatever it is it doesn't matter what you struggle with or whether you know we all have some sort of be settings in whether it's laziness or whatever it is right but but but the desire God's already put that desire and you do not want to that's right and you're not looking you're looking when that ministers up there preaching you're looking you're saying Lord changed me through your word that's a desirable Holy Ghost field Christian I want your word to changement but the critic the one who's just got mental knowledge let me see what I can do to criticize you know yeah that's that case but uh you know the Lord be the judge of those things that's wrong so amen all right and we'll finish with this one some more examples of what being the word meaning water I just had to have these four Isaiah 55 for as the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and return earth not thither but water it the earth and make it bring forth and bug that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent any man that word that that was placed in the disciples a man was three and a half years and they came to fruition on pea Pentecost amen all right and same thing you know I really believe that in my life in my case my wife she grew up in the message right I I did I think I experienced the world I experienced the nomination I got said I've went through seven Church ages of different churches I know what the cuts the Catholics talk about I've been in the Jehovah's Witness I've been on all those things because I was with mom and dad so I had to follow everything wherever they went you were good yeah I was drugged good not because I'm Colombian that's right but and so the things that brother Dale speaks about when using the Baptist Church I'm familiar with those things because I went through the Baptist Church I know what they believe and I like what the brother Ernie said last night and I think another thing I heard you say that before but that is so true they believe in praying for the sick yeah but they better not get well I don't believe in a miracle they believe us they don't believe in them they did not believe in miracles I mean you go to a Baptist Church at the church that I went to now some Baptists they'll they believe in clapping your hands when you're singing in and things like that it's more of the free practice you know it but the church that Baptist Church I went it was fundamental Baptist they're tied in with Bob Jones University they don't believe a blessing everyone telling University there was that so we have known University graduates up oh really yeah till they set their life just like that and so it was strange for me you know when I came to Pentecost came into the message to see things like this on the wall people clapping their hands and and being happy and shouting and things like that it was a whole strange for me sure and we thought my goodness these people are going straight to hell yeah I mean that's what we thought my mom and dad and we thought you know but then as as you start seeing things more clear in the word and you start seeing you know this this is part of the kingdom you know the kingdom of God is it's not a starchy opera opera room they don't you say you may not have emotion right now but I believe you'll have emotion at some point yeah you might as well just start getting happy now yeah I'm excited in the word I mean because and I know brother Dale you know he's used to you know and the way we Minister the word here it's in the teaching form so we want to pay attention we want to listen there's times where we we should just let the spirits where I am at be happy because I'm in theirs it has to be a balance a viewer has to be a balance oh no no I just so much start you nicely and but there has to be a balance you know just bring that together I'm in would be a super Church I'm not saying that you know I'm not trying to be critical but I'm in you know at the Baptist Church you get a little bit excited and people would just look back at ya the same thing in some message churches so anyways should we get going good I'm not throwing anything all right but uh all right so we'll just stop we'll just leave it there anybody have anything you say and before we go we gotta do some scheduling adjustment brother Jones gonna be doing the perfect reefs and he's in April so you want to do it you Aaron but society tonight with me yes April the first which is gonna be here be presenting white rock your partly used across Sunday either one the first thing we hate I'm just kidding the first in the eighth
