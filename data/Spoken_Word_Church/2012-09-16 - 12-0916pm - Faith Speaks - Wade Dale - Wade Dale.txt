and every one of you with us if you got your bibles if you would turn to the book of second corinthians and we will uh start on a little subject that it kind of struck my heart uh if you realize some of the brethren that have been here and also uh some of the brethren that were speaking at the uh at the meeting that we went to in virginia speaking on faith so we're going to speak a little bit this afternoon on faith speaks faith speaks faith is not silent faith says something we're going to read here the mayor brother brown said faith's got hair on his chest got teeth man faith is something that we need because if we don't have faith in what we're doing then we're men most miserable you gotta have faith in what's going on have faith in what's uh and what's happening you have to have you have to have faith just to make it through the day all right i mean we we need to have more faith and we need to have a substance faith and then let that faith speak all right in second corinthians chapter four i guess by way of announcements the only thing we really have to announce is the fpu class this afternoon will start at five and then i think terence already said this morning and the guys did here i think i couldn't hear him in the back but october the 20th we'll be having our fall festival down at the uh at the daleville chicken house which is being renovated because the uh the winds of change blue the roof off so we they are putting a roof on now and and getting everything ready to go so just pray for that now um if you would like to um keep that scripture right there for just a minute because i want to make a comment afterwards but let's uh let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father we pray that you would today just touch us lord be with each one of us in this congregation father that that you would come our way lord and it wouldn't be just the words of a mortal man but it would be your word father it'd be the words that you have to speak to your people that you become lord an active participant in the service not just a bystander lord we don't want to be we don't want to be something that you don't want us to be lord we want to be something that's molded in your image we want to be a child lord that it's starting and then lord we don't want to stay a child we want to grow up into the things that you've given us we pray lord that you just be with the congregation now lord just open our eyes and open our ears that we may hear and see what you have for us lord bless the little bride around the world father bless the missionaries on the foreign fields take care of them lord give them fruit for their labor lord you said if there'd be any sick among us you sent your word and healed the people and deliver them from their destruction so lord there is there is the atonement laying there father for each one of us to grab hold of father just bless us be with us take care of us we ask all these things in the name of jesus christ amen second corinthians 4 we have this same have we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken now that's in the book of psalms we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you now watch paul paul is prophesying he's talking about himself but he's talking about a group that's to come but he said for look he says knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus so he was dead all right and shall present us with you so he's talking to a group of people for all things are for your sake you're saved that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redounds to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment well ze wells you worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal all right you may be seen in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word but look what what paul is saying here knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and present shall present us with you right there talk about two groups of people what's going to go by the grave and i believe one that's going to be standing at the chains of the body all right now listen i want us to let to listen today that faith speaks and i want you to apply it to your life and apply it to everything in your life not just not just religious matters because we are humans and we are living in this world and as long as we're going to be in this world we got to live in the world but not of the world right right so in our finances and in our daily walk in life and the things that we do we should always have faith in what we're doing amen all right because if you don't have faith then you don't have the works and you don't have the other things and and i was looking at a quote but i couldn't pull it up because the the copiers messed up back there but but brother brown says these things that we do if we can't handle i'll read a quote in just a second that i did get off that we got to be able to handle certain things that god's going to give us see if we can handle it and then give us more if we can handle this the word money job life this applies to everything all right because god's not going to give you something amiss because he doesn't make mistakes right we do we make mistakes he knows what we're going to do with it but he's not going to pile a whole lot of word on you if your life's not right he's not going to pile a whole lot of faith on you if you don't believe right all right but there's a group of people that's going to have to believe to the body change that's going to have to take a basis of just like faith at the pyramid gonna have to take a base and build from that amen built up the bible says what into these things so it's not just something that says well i have faith well james said if you got faith show me your works faith without works is dead i'll show you my faith by the works that i do right all right so let's just realize for just a little while that we've got to have not a super duper faith but we do have to have a faith different right than luther's faith different than wesley's faith you say different not in contrast no but different as in the just shall live by faith will not get you even into the body of christ now but it did luther we'll read a quote in a little while that brother brown said and that's preached in a long time ago that the woman that touched him of jesus's garment she had faith for her time so let's realize that we do we have faith for the time that we're living in and god will not give you the faith of another age he gives you the faith for your age and you must accept that faith and then what you do with that faith if not it doesn't become dormant you must speak it right all right because there's an approach to all these things there's an approach to god remember in the old testament the the high priest had to everything had to be perfect right he couldn't miss one step or he would it meant death right now that was a natural man taking a natural blood into the into the holy of holies what about now that the holiest of holy blood the blood of god that was shed for you and i i mean and we take it and we fumble around with it and we stumble and we fall but the bible says come boldly to the throne of grace we have a high priest a high priest that he will that high priest went in once a year for the sins of the people they confess their sins the high priest took the blood in and they were covered but it didn't do away with sin but when jesus came he did away with sin that's why we could approach we like brother bob was talking this morning about solomon's porch you get to a certain you get to a certain level and you have to stop even in god there's a road map even in god there's a way to approach him right you you approach him and you know we we try to to help as much as we can but you can't have the things of the world and just walk in here and sit down and think god's going to give you something right our problem is we get it here but not here if you get it here that's okay but it's got to come into here it's like and what this struck me was what brother they was talking about listen you take the daniel 70 weeks the daniel 70 weeks is to the jews right the seals are to the jews and you know you have these brethren that are that are saying well well it doesn't matter about daniel 70 weeks why are we getting all worked up about it it's to the jews that's true so now let's just throw our seal book away too let's just throw the seal book away because this to the jews too when are we going to quit throwing away books when are we going to quit throwing away tapes when we're going to quit throwing away quotes we can't do that we got to have faith in what we believe and then not just stand there we got to be able to speak it you got to be able to take your revelation and take it to the jews because that's what it's going to come out of it's going to come out of you right it's going to come out of an end time people and what's going to the jews is not going to be corruptable they have corruptible already that's what their problem is they need incorruptible word of god they need somebody to tell them the truth that's right and go over there with faith two prophets is gonna walk over there and the bible says whatever comes out of their mouth that's what's gonna happen what faith is gonna speak but faith is not going to speak because that's the first time it ever happened i don't believe that i don't believe they're just going to go over there and do something different than what we do we've got it they've got to take what we have and take it over there and say you missed this that's right you missed a messiah you've had a problem for 2500 years or 2 000 years or how long it is you have a problem now you don't have a problem because this group of people spoke and god answered their prayers so therefore two prophets can stand and say hey if they can do it with a message that they had and that same message is here now you see how snowball yes faith is a snowball you got to have you got to have people in you know in our financial peace class the reason we get together is because we want to speak our experience right we know every sunday we're going to come together and we're going to talk about our experience with money that's called accountability right same way with god we got to have some accountability with god that's why we gather together as an assembly every sunday and every wednesday we become accountable not to each other but to god because god said i'll meet you in here that's right now we know he can meet you in other places but he said i'll meet you right here at 10 and at 2 and it's 7 o'clock if you miss it then you miss god you miss a visitation because he said he'd be here right we're two or three together to my name they'll be in the midst but apply this and i love what brother tim pruitt was saying this past weekend when we're in virginia now let me tell you something brother tim pruitt most of you don't know him there was a lady told him one time he was the meanest preacher in the message right said you're the meanest preacher in the message because he's very strict very stern very hard most of you just heard him you know that but he's got a good revelation and he preaches good he's a good minister good good pastor there in louisiana but he said look he said i found out that you can't beat the people into doing anything he said oh you can make them conform like alcoholics anonymous make you conform but we want to transform so he said let's preach faith let the people catch a revelation of faith in this believe in the message and you'll come to church on time you'll do the right thing you'll handle your money right you'll do all these things right because look god's not going to let you just he's not gonna let us run wild he let him run wild in the church ages that's right he really did he let him believe the one one god was trinity and he let him believe baptism was this because of our ignorance but now this age all that goes away all that goes out buddy that goes out the door that's not the faith that you and i are called to you and i are called to a perfect faith glory jesus walked in the world of perfect faith and i'm gonna read you a quote in a minute jesus said brother brown said jesus walked in the world of perfect faith and he was the word that when we become the word guess what that brings us into a walk of perfect faith all right so listen let's just don't let's just get a base in here maybe we can do it a little bit later on but let's preach faith believe in something amen oh sure god god you know a prostitute can have faith she enters into a a part of god that says if you'll just believe me i'll give you this right but a christian's got to have more than just that kind of faith right we got to bring a perfect faith in the word she didn't have a faith in the word or she wouldn't be a prostitute she had faith for her time and for what needs she needs god will answer your prayer and you'll be a rank sinner he did me when i was a sinner i had a migraine one night late in bed and i was sick and i was a rank center this was in the 90s and i said god i need to get some sleep i got to go to work in the mornings when i was getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning going to work and you know what if all of you have migraines before even after you get over the migraine it's still there your head soaring completely went away because i entered into something to where i believed in god and i believed what he said for that time though because the rest of the time i was a sinner okay but now you and i must have faith upon faith upon faith upon faith not just one little spot of faith we got to have substance faith that when we get up in the morning we got faith when we go to bed at night we got faith right so that's what we're coming to it's not just well i got healed so god must be with me that'll mean a thing i don't mean a thing i'm sorry i said people believe it that's right i know they do but now remember we're going to bring to and i'll show you when we start with the quotes in a minute that there is a mental faith you do have to get it in the mental part it's got to come right here first you first must hear the word because somebody's got to speak it right that's right so you got to hear it it's got to become mental but let's don't keep it at the mental faith part because brother brown says then it drops down into a spiritual revelation becomes a part of you amen faith's not something that we need on a shelf and we go get it that's what i think people think well i'll just i'll just i need faith for this you're supposed to have it already here this is where you draw from you draw it from here you don't draw it from from off the shelf and say well i need it so i'll just have it no we got to walk in a world of perfect faith and you know what god said we were supposed to through a prophet he told us we were supposed to so he's not going to leave his hand he's made a way for us to do that he's made a way for us to be that way but now the word speak means make a statement or to express with a voice speak faith speaks faith is not silent faith is not something that we have to work up the bible says there we also believe and therefore speak amen you gotta believe in something you got to believe in something before you can speak it all right i believe that you'll go through this financial peace class i believe that you'll get your debts paid off i believe that you know why because i've done it i've had an experience of just something just that jim and i have had an experience with this so same way with god i've had an experience with god so i can speak what i believe that's right right right but it can't be i can't say well i still believe in a trinity oh i may believe that but that's what dad was talking about that's the deception you got to watch it because it'll move over in a deception if it's not the word of god right right but if it's the word of god it's got to come to pass it's got to be there it's already there what you and i have to do is just get it right just go get it so let's look at the first quote number one faith comes by hearing but if you just rely on hope you hinder faith oh i hope i'm gonna i hope i'm gone you know we used to have pep rallies at football games you know we used to just oh man well you know what it was just a hope right it was just a hope it wasn't a faith it was just hope they were trying to build you in the faith but it was just a hope but in this with god it's not never a hope because the hope is you're hoping towards something that you really don't know anything about but faith is the substance when faith comes to you and you believe that you can see it how many of you saw jesus hanging on a cross none of us but we believe it's so strong that i can tell you about it right i've had the experience of it because why the spirit that was in that guy hanging on the cross is in me that's when i can read the word different than a baptist if he's not born again he's just reading letters on a page and getting a mental conception of what's going on but if you and i have become born again that born-again experience doesn't make you a good person it brings a very eternal god you had to believe a word you had to believe some words somebody told you something right to get you to believe and that anchored and you said hey i know that man died on a cross because the soul that was in that man is now in me i have to believe that to be a son and daughter of god you have to believe that right but if you just rely on hope you hinder faith now hope looks for something way off i hope i hope we're gonna we say it all the time people but we we're humans that's the human part oh we hope this is to be better we hope we're going to do this well no but faith claims it right now right see faith says god said so in his mind that settles it but hope says god said so and i'm expecting to get it someday prophesying right someday someday it's gonna happen to somebody else you see i'm expecting someday and as long as satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants that's right that's as good as he wants i don't want satan to have anything good he don't deserve anything good because faith stands up and takes over rule when faith speaks everything else keeps still everything else keeps still that's right all right let's go number two the sin of unbelief like abraham who called those things he were not as though they were he took god at his word believing that he was able to perform that what he had promised the trouble of it is with the church today that's us right the trouble of it is with the church today we come with hope instead of faith i hope brother dale's got something for me today you see what i'm saying i hope brother dale brings something for me today i hope god beats us here faith is positive faith needs no booster faith knows what it's talking about faith is strong faith has hairs on his chest it speaks and the rest of them shut up symptoms can't even speak at all when real godly faith speaks it's got the floor it knows where it's at why because it's had an experience it's had an experience with god if you've had an experience with god you can't take that experience away from me that i had 12 years 14 years ago you can't take it away because i was there i experienced it it wasn't something i'm still hoping for something that i have amen it's a possession all right let's go number three this is this queen of sheba that's what the church has done with these things with all these gifts of god you just pin them up they're not usable see let them loose exercise faith get some muscles in it let me tell you faith has got hair on the chest this is the second time he said that when faith speaks everything else sits down that's right that's right when it speaks everything else shuts up that's like we're talking about these doctrines these doctrines i guess you can fool people into having faith in them but you can't have faith in something that doesn't have a foundation a false doctrine does not have a foundation a false doctrine is like father son holy ghost and brother brown said that come from the pits of hell had no found no foundation my false doctrine has no foundation right all right number four 4a we're going to do 4b also i have a great faith to believe that one day before the coming of the lord that our little differences will be seven god may have to let communism sweep us together but something will take place that'll make us all one heart and one accord if we can't have faith now for healing how are we going to have rapturing faith we've got to have faith for the little things first first before the great things that's right all right so there'll be something that'll cause that's on that's in god's providence i do not know but i've seen a demonstration of it recently and that's what i want to tell you about all right let's go to number b god keeps his word 1957. so listen to this this is brother branham praying in sturgis michigan to a group of people but don't we believe he was talking to us every service we don't believe he was just talking to those people right we believe he talks to us every time he was talking he was speaking to you and i all right so he's not just talking to them so we pray he's praying to god he's praying a prayer for us so we pray that he will come tonight and interpret the word and the meanings that would create faith for the salvation of souls watch him and for the healing of bodies next and for the bringing of joy to the saints and establishing him that they might continue on now he had prayer there for the people that were sick or for the salvation of the soul then for the healing of the body then for bringing joy of those that's already been healed and don't need divine healing right at that time they need something else what was it the preaching of the word of god to establish them that they might continue on grant these blessings father and the forgiveness of our sins as we ask in jesus name so he's praying a prayer for you and i but watch the steps souls first healing next and then bringing joys to the saints and establishing them how are you going to be established how do you get established you get established in the word right right because the words were the foundation heaven earth will pass away but my word will not fail will not pass away all right so now here's our problem we must have this substance before we can speak it you gotta have substance faith before you can speak so don't just start saying faith speaks and you just start speaking because remember you can speak a myth brother brown said you be careful you can take something off of a person that god put on them remember right you can take something off of a person that god meant to stay on that person he said you have to be careful all right i've got a quote in here somewhere i don't know if i put it in or not but he said in the prayer line he was telling the people he said if you've got unconfessed sins he said you better put it under the blood now because when we start this prayer line god can go all the way back in your life why he's going back into their life to get their life right first right then to bring faith for their healing all right that's one that he said a christian wouldn't get a lot of times wouldn't get healing because our mentality is oh we did this wrong we did this wrong we did this wrong we did this wrong we did this wrong wow there was a consciousness of sin right so we couldn't we block our we block faith faith is not weak faith is perfect faith is strong faith has hair on his chest has teeth sometimes we take all that away and we make faith weak by what we do i said by what we do that's right but you must have the substance to speak it but you can't speak it remember the resurrection was not spoken out in the graveyard to a bunch of dead people right who heard it live people so you got to speak to live people somebody's got to be able to hear it all right so that's you and i so i'm building up something because we've got to build on something what i what i see our problem is lula georgia included we think we're up there at the headstone and we don't have faith enough to act right i said faith enough to act right we don't i'll read you something just a minute i'm i didn't just put these together for anything but there's an approach to it because remember what's brother dale been preaching go back and read those combat bees what do they do combat beasts didn't run out there and say here's the third seal starting with the first one that's right right right here's number four when it's supposed to be two because what is the combat beast where did that come from that comes from the holy ghost the combat beast is your holy ghost lion ox man and eagle that's the holy ghost and what does that be say that beast steps out and says come and see come and understand not physically see right sure john physically saw and wrote it down that's what he was told to do but not you and i right we get not the symbol we get the revelation so to see is to what understand so the combat beast in your life is saying come and understand that's right right come and understand what i've already spoke yes don't the symbol is there for us in our finite brains to comprehend at one period of time but that doesn't stay horse rider well i was right no there's a revelation to go with that that's right same thing with the daniel 70 weeks not always dates and times and seasons which is exactly perfectly right if you know what if you know what you're talking about in the word of god but it's a plan of redemption glory it's a it's a it's a parable we're going to see it next sunday it's a parable with an underlying meaning same way with the combat be same way with the seals because we don't get the physical seeing of the seal open right see it with our physical eyes you better not that's right but we get the revelation by seeing understanding that's why i said if you're gonna throw the daniel 70 week's book out you might as well throw the seal book out that's right that's right because this other jews you might as well throw feasts of the trumpets out you might as well throw all these other things out revelations five and six and seven and eight and nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixty seventeen eighteen terry bible throw it away because it's not two of us but we got to have the spiritual revelation to get us out of here because that spiritual revelation has got to come up out of that paper that revelation has got to come out of that paper listen to this not just the two witnesses first it's got to come up to you and me first right without you and i taking a body change they don't go to israel because a man of sin has to come down when we go up we become incarnate god he doesn't know how to do that yet it's a devil in that pope but when it comes to the time to where that devil is going to move out of the way and the big guy's going to come in same way with you and i right right same way with you and i we get the earnest of our inheritance sure we get the baptism of the holy ghost and that puts us in a rapture but to take a body change we need the man himself we need the holy ghost himself christ to come down and so take care of this being to us and god or the same person and he can change that body we go up satan comes down and says oh that's how you do it so he goes and incarnates the pope and says now i i'm here to take over but two prophets are going to take a revelation that we had it's not gonna be us going over there and speaking it to them but remember if we stay silent if we stay silent there's nothing to be said right that's right but we gotta speak jesus said speak to this mountain can't say write it down on a piece of paper he said speak to this mountain and it'll be moved so speaking has a lot to do with that's what really caught me when they were talking about faith because faith has to speak faith can't stay silent it has to speak from you not just from me or brother dale it's got to come from your mouth the word of faith you preach think about that but the combat beast says come and understand what the one inside of you glory not over here john got the over here to see the simple but you and i that combat beast every sunday every time you turn on the tape every time you come on wednesday night every time you talk between each other that combat beast rises up and says hey come here i'll show you something that's right come here i want to show you something this is what i was talking about this is what i was talking about that's why you guys have a perfect word if you got a perfect god inside of you you're gonna have a perfect word and you're gonna be able to speak be therefore perfect that's right even as your father in heaven all right number five we got it up here oh this is it right here all right so watch the approach brother brown says here a few nights ago saw a woman people when they come to the platform ugly vulgar things that they've done down in their life now remember friends those things are told publicly right here before this audience what you've done in your life is told right here so if there's anything upon your heart and you do not wish it to be known stay out of the prayer line if you don't want to be known unless that you come with a perfect faith or ask god to forgive you and put it under the blood in the sea of forgetfulness and whatever it is because i will not be responsible for what is said but what been brought out because it's in your life that's coming out right right so the approach to that is what we have to become let's look at number six we have to become right because righteousness being means being right that's just a simple way of saying well to be righteous means to be right the righteousness of god all right let's read this all right here we are blasphemous name let's just read the the part that's underlined and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god all right but if this that's capital t-h-i-f-t-a-t cap but it's this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word all right and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation now look he's in blasphemous names what's he preaching he's preaching the spirituality part of that right there remember he preached the statue of a perfect man and then sometime later he's preached blasphemous names all right read blasphemous names it'll really help you on your statue of a perfect man because he goes through each one here but watch the spiritual part of this not a fundamental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when them streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual revelation but the five strings now what he done was as far as i know and from what i remember he drew this again or when he drew it he was talking about sister shepard's dream where she you know where she sees him whip the top off of the pyramid and and and then look down in it and then the red the part that she had was she said she saw water start coming out remember start the water started coming out the top of the pyramid and flowing down and it was trash still going up the statue of perfect man yeah we got trash we got trash yet we got to get cleaned out but that's what it was doing right washington the water by the word the word comes in waters it and what does it do from the inside out right it wasn't raining on the pyramid it was falling water from the inside out all right but the five streams you see coming down through here tempers this together he's talking about he's got little lines running down through here it tempers all this together because i swear a lot of people have a problem they think well you gotta you gotta go all the way up there and get the holy ghost where it says holy spirit no that's that's that's a not a different holy spirit that's a different dip in the holy spirit i'm talking about water here so let's go to the dippin the holy spirit is right here you can't have faith without having the new birth you can't have godly virtue knowledge and all this will happen in your birth but when you get to right here that's what molds everything together that's when god can begin to start trusting you more right that's right that's right the reason we don't we all of us are not further down the road than we are is god is not able to trust us with what we've got that's right because we've been using it wrong that's right and i don't mean wrong as in sinning but brother i said we sin every day so we must be doing something wrong not something to lose our salvation but our call is not just to just show it by faith it's to get out of here all right so we gotta have a perfect substance faith to get out of here not just the faith but the five strings you see coming down through here tempers this together and it's been the holy spirit that made the ephesus church it was the holy spirit that birthed the smyrna church he's going look he's going up the line it's the holy spirit that gives the pergamos church the entire church in the arcade it's the holy spirit that built that bride the elect that's pulled out of all the organizational systems down through the ages like that there's an elected a predestinated bride of jesus christ that the holy spirit has called out the elect and it's been the holy ghost in this age that age that that that that on up to the top the holy spirit so he proves it right there spend the holy spirit in the ages all right but they've had a dip they had the same water we got they got it in a small portion all right and now as in the individuals we're gentiles right right we get it individually these virtues and things our knowledge and temperance is added to our faith then when the capstone comes the holy spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the holy spirit that's why it's so short today he's not going back to the baptism of the holy ghost that puts you in the body he's talking about the baptism of the holy ghost it puts you at adoption where god can use you he's not going to use a novice he if he gave me if he gave you patience we were talking about patience today he said he didn't want the kind that made tribulation because tribulation work is patient right i said well buddy you're in bad shape because to get up there you gotta have a little tribulation and i'm not going to tell you what he's saying about being married to tribulation did i just say no sorry your coupon for that get your lap a little bit but listen tribulation working patience but to get up through there god's not going to just give you these virtues and and you be it's just like a kid a kid's not you give a kid a gun i i was telling him yesterday somebody came down to work the other day and bought a car well we have to prove where they live so he had a phone bill six pages long it was over thousand dollars cell phone bill somebody looked down and said two thousand dollars he said yeah don't ever give your son which was eight years old sitting right beside of him don't ever give him an iphone and give him internet access i started to go man do you let him drive and that little boy was like yeah thousand dollars that was mine and i said i wasn't with you son i said i'd whip your daddy i said man you ought to know better than to give a boy that's like giving a little kid a gun what is this that's what god is with the virtues i'm trying to make a point here god's not going to give you a virtue that you're going to shoot yourself between the eyes with he's going to give you that virtue when you're ready not before because remember power without character is satanic you can use every one of these virtues against people and against god you can but not the godly ones you can't not the ones that god seals by the holy ghost he knows you've got knowledge and he knows you'll treat the word right guess what you'll have knowledge don't worry you'll have godly knowledge you'll be able to explain the word of god not to to a degree of of maybe a minister but you know what the bible says you need to give a reason of the hope that lies within you stated to show yourself approved right you don't have to prove me god's going to prove me or not one of the two he's going to prove me or not approve me one of the two same thing with you all right but you see what brother brown was saying he's saying this and this and this you're going up now coming from the holy spirit what has come then he will give to you supernatural faith he give you faith down here to get into the body be earnest of your inheritance brother brown said a little button you know what he said a little button that button is as eternal as god is but it's a little button it has limitations that you put on it not it you put on it right same substance as in the ocean is in a teaspoon but it's just a teaspoon all right but there's a whole ocean out there but you say i just want a little teaspoon no i want the whole ocean because that's what he said now coming from the holy spirit what has come then he will give to you supernatural faith spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't it don't do no good that only knows the word that faith only knows the word that's real spiritual faith see then that was number one number one coming to you your mental faith right here comes the holy spirit comes down into your mental faith makes it a spiritual faith then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word down right and number two three then you'll have spiritual you'll have to have the holy spirit and will seal all these things into you as the holy spirit covers this you see what he's talking about the holy spirit's covering all these not baby form but i'm talking about up here where you're an adult right where god can use you i want to be used glory i want to be used by god right right we've been used by the world long enough we let the world use us for a long time didn't we how about unless you saying god uses for a while and number two three then you have spiritual you'll have to have the holy spirit and it will seal all these things into you as that holy spirit covers this from your faith up to the holy spirit seals you in with christ then you become one amen you become one see you and christ live together at that day you'll know that i am in the father father and me i and you and you and me see that then that's a sealed unit of the lord god now amen and then they are vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become vindicated not just sons and daughters they become vindicated sons and daughters of god all right go to the next one keep going it's just blasphemous names just keep going now when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these virtues in him that god can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brother kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and there that's when you see the sons and daughters of god all right so everybody with me now you got you got your faith down here at the bottom and then you keep going and you keep going and it keeps becoming a substance as you walk with god it becomes a substance it just keeps going it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then now let's let's go to uh to the next one should be romans 10. listen to this romans 10 verse 6 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh that's ongoing not just one time speaketh on this wise say not in thy heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above in other words why are you saying your heart that god's got to come from somewhere is that always saying or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it what is the it righteousness amen what is it when you have righteousness which is rightness these little things in our life we got to get rid of right but we got to have faith it's not going to do any good to sit here and you know you can look people straight in the eye and if we just don't repent anymore we don't we just go oh that's a good sermon still going to do the same thing you were doing before but what sayeth it in other words what say so it must be something speaking what saith it the word is nigh they even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that thou shalt confess with thy mouth in other words speak with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in that heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for the heart of man believeth unto rightness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation you've got to confess it for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the jews and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon his name for whosoever shall call upon in that call speak speak call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed the question how are you going to call on somebody you just really don't believe in that's right right right and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard that's right and how shall they hear without a preacher so we got it here it's got to be spoken but we got to hear it and then act on it right all right now listen if you speak if you speak right with rightness he's got to hear you right right because it's him him speaking that's right that's right it's not you it's him that's doing the speaking that's right he knows what you need he knows what you want but if you just sit there and don't say anything and don't claim anything and don't claim you know the blessings of god then then you're just an unbeliever right that makes you an unbeliever all right now let's go to the next scripture god having provided some better thing for us we know this one that they without us should not be made perfect now what's hebrews 11 hebrews 11 is the great hall of fame of faith right by faith this one did by faith this one did by faith but god summoned every bit of it up down to one scripture all that faith was fine for their time but that faith without our faith they can't be made perfect their faith without our faith i'm not changing the scripture i don't believe i think that's okay because god hasn't provided some better thing for us that they that have faith but without our faith nobody's gonna be made perfect all right let's go to the next scripture i want you to listen to this and and for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away now we're not going to do away when that which is perfect has come we receive faith down here right with the new birth but when this comes we're not going to do away with this but i like what brother tim tim pruitt said brother tim pruitt said that which is in part won't do now that which is in part won't do now it'd do for them but that which is perfect has come and we believe that's true the perfect vindicated word has been brought to us right and that which is in part won't do us any good anymore that's right not done away with it just won't get us in the body like i said about justification and sanctification you can be justified and sanctify and go to hell but wesley couldn't be sanctified and go to hell his sanctification put him in the body because he had faith for his time he wasn't required he didn't have a prophet that would come and break the word open and say hey you need faith you need virtue you need knowledge it's good not to drink tea because it has no value it's good enough to do this and do's and don'ts that's why they're called methodists they have a method of doing things right that's exactly why it's called methodist but it's john wesley's teaching but that was good for the time because what was god doing though god was getting the people to realize this and realize this i've said many times before if brother branham would have came on the scene there had been no pentecostal age if brother brown would have come on scene right after the methodist people wouldn't have been able to handle it with the signs and the wonders and the miracles that he had there had to be a justification there had to be a sanctification of people that got ready and then a pentecostal people that the holy ghost fell in the gift we'll see here brother brown steps right out at him buddy he's right in the middle of the gift so they accepted that and the people accepted it but that was just the bait on the hook for him it put azusa street in the body of christ but it started his platform for to build a perfect faith every bit of that was headed toward me and you amen that was his purpose he said it's gone from you you're not even supposed to get it right amen that's right in other words it's coming amen but now we don't say it's coming we say it's here the word of faith you speak but number seven perfect faith your genuine faith will do it right here your genuine faith will make it so real to you that look at that little woman with a blood issue and when she touched it to prove that it stopped it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me that perfect faith and that same see but now remember the woman came with a perfect faith for that time right now her perfect faith at that time wouldn't even put us in the body of christ she had faith she had faith that god would heal her right right but that's the faith for that time and we got to have that i hope you get one i'm i'm trying to build something because faith has got to come in stages yes right my brother said we're praying for the faith to save souls tonight we're praying for the faith to heal the bodies tonight we're praying for the faith of the people that already have the new birth and already are healed we're we're having faith that they'll enjoy this and that they'll use this and build their self up and that's what you and i got to do we can't just say well i'm going to have faith you can't do that that's right and honestly it'll blow us away if god give us everything at one time we can't handle it as human finite being but as but as an infinite god starts changing you and i listen to this starts changing you and i we can handle it that way a little at a time add to your faith virtue knowledge tempest all right let's go to the next one all right listen perfect faith jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word everybody says glory hallelujah but let's don't stop and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me my words in you my words which this word abides in me then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you've said believe in what you've said amen then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it it will be given to you time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already it's already over with all right let's go to the next one but jesus is still out of perfect faith but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about right he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was right if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world now i want to ask y'all something are you a mystic to the world or do you just mingle with the world and they can't tell the difference in you and the next guy or gal i'm just going to ask you that question because you're going to have to answer it not me you understand what i'm saying your house should be built on on christian principles your faith should be built on christian principles your work should be built on christian principles you should be built on christian principles if you're a christian if you're not your house is going to fall you've got pretend faith you've got pretend virtue pretend knowledge we got to quit pretending if we're wrong we're wrong and you know what the bible gives us something to be right that's why i say we ought to know that we're wrong and i think that's what the problem is because the bible says in the end time iniquity will abound not sin iniquity will abound what is iniquity knowing you're doing it right and not doing anything about it that's right the mystery of iniquity what a mystery of it is we're doing things that we know we shouldn't do and we just keep on doing it and we want god to bless us and want god to do these things for us we want god to make have faith in god have faith in what god said but jesus said in the world that no one knows he was an odd person he lived in the world perfect faith and a perfect god in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world exactly you know we trying to like the guy says we try to get on the fence well the devil owns the fence that's right the bible says flee flee from it don't try to camp around it that's right you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what if it forbid you would not do then the people began to say that you'd be a mystic to them that's the way it is to all believers there are mystic the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them you know they say this you know in other words they're talking riddles and he was he was talking in parables he'd have to stop every once in a while and he'd have to explain what he was saying right why they didn't have the holy ghost but when peter stood up on the day of pentecost that's what i was trying to get the people to see last weekend even the ministers to see that that you know do we have to have a quote like brother claude said brother claus said uh if not hang and available you so but what are we doing here what do we need a verbatim quote for everything jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood or you will have no part with a son of man and he didn't stop and take two hours to explain it paul was a holy ghost several years 20 or 30 years later paul picks it up in corinthians and daddy reads that every time we have to take communion i have been given this from the lord paul wasn't even there that night but the holy ghost took what jesus said and broke it down and said hey this is the cup and which is my blood that's being shed for you this is the bread this is the broken body this is my body which i've broken for you you see what happens with the holy ghost we might not verbatim quote everything and we might have a quote for everything that we do but or everything that we say but if if if it rings right with the rest of the bible and if it rings right with the prophet's message then i'm all right with that eat my flesh and drink my blood they thought he was a vampire but paul picks it up 20 years later why didn't peter do that peter was a prophet peter was sitting there that night when he said both things why didn't peter get the revelation but paul had to get to revelation 20 years later the holy ghost just dropped down and said hey that's what i was talking about when i was when i said eat my flesh and drink my blood all right so see how god works yes god works that way so don't don't be so don't get all bent out of shape if we don't quote it verbatim but now if it don't fit flat brother brown said god wrote between the lines the love letters between the lines but he said he's got to compare with above and below the line it can't be something different all right so let's go let's go get into that but still we we look we we're looking for things that and it's like brother brown said he said people are looking now just to refute what you're saying not to listen to try to learn why because it's a spirit of the age all right it's a spirit of iniquity and that's the way it is people it's iniquity there's no one to do better and not doing it so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bribe material right now you're getting into bright material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacon trustee that means for the lady every individual walks in a world with god alone amen he gives the orders you pack them out right you know brother brown said back up for a minute brother brian said you know he said let me walk into a guy's office let me walk into a guy in other words let me say this let me walk into a guy's home let me walk into your home you walk into my home open every closet open every door you're not gonna find anything any different um you know most of you especially the ones that are taking the class you know my life as well as i do because i told you all my finances i don't care anything to hide but are you showing god in everything you do every aspect of your life i know we slip up and we fail and we do things wrong but there are certain principle primer things brother brown said that we're supposed to be doing or god's not gonna deal with us we might be a child but remember brother brown said the holy ghost would go back to the father and said hey he's not acting like you that's right you know what god says he's my son but he's gonna stay out there in that field and work he's going to beat his head up against the wall and he's going to work and he's going to sweat until he realizes that i can give him more if he'll just act right and that's what god's doing just like children i want to give that eight-year-old boy an iphone because i would have expected the same results out of any eight-year-old i wanted to strangle that dude you what the parents you don't want the kids he didn't know where the kid was like five thousand dollars was mine that was mine that was my part bragging and that's the same way with god same way with god god gives us a blessing and then we just just mess it up so bad and he's like you're still a kid i can't give that to you again until you grow up and prove to me i'm not going to give that to you anymore i'm not giving you any more word until you can deal with the word that you already got all right so let's work on revelation and let it be something that anchors into our heart that's what i said about faith speaks you ought to be able to take what you believe and tell it to anybody in the world now whether they understand it or not but you ought to be able to explain the hope that's inside of you now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it now watch when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance all right amen to that come on people we got to be able to wear you know and all right we're going to preach faith i'm going to get off each all folks but but you know other churches worship they worship god and and they don't have half the word we got right and some of you haven't raised your hands if you raise your hands you hear the bones popping amen maybe we're not as far as we should be they sit at a ball game like this at the georgia game i've never seen anybody unless they're dead except like that at a georgia game no what do they do they get there three hours early they got on all their stuff they ain't got a replica football so they can throw it back and forth with their other drunk friends a lot like brother ron said he said if you get drunk on the holy ghost one time you'll act like in people faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyway you know i don't know how my kids are coming i don't worry about that abraham 25 years later he was in worse shape physically than he was when the promise was made but he didn't look at the journey he looked at the promise forget the journey sure we got to go through the journey but forget the ups and downs and ins and outs and oh my god they're over here doing this and doing that i just believe i don't care if they're laying on their deathbed god's going to save them so there you go whatever circumstance does not make any difference right and faith and love is relation i like that because the bible says you can have faith you can have revelation but without love without charity it's nothing right right and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together all right let's go to the next one number nine let's listen now watch perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is see now when you love somebody you love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't do it because you do and you know you do oh oh i prove it by the way i live to him see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i love my wife i love my husband see your life proves what you are the same thing christianity does see your faith you have confidence in one another is pure it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you've got it and yet your actions prove it all right when satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like jesus did the word of god is perfect we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist satan by his faith in his word we he conquers we can conquer anything both death hell and the grave we know that god is god that perfect faith in god's perfect word he conquered everything that he come in contact with he never went to a funeral right he conquered death every time he never went to a funeral flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly bert you going from his garment and do the same thing then walk in the same kind of a way virtues flowing from you the rivers of god fountains of blessings that's flowing out of the people see what i mean and you're not blessing it you're not imagining it it's actually taking place and you see it when you see it you'll speak it that's right that's my quote not that one when you see it you'll speak it because you can't keep it that's right you can't keep it inside that's right who's the one that said it's like a fire shut up in my bones once you see something that's right you have to speak you have to say something and you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it's actually taking place and you see it if you're just imagining it that don't do any good but if it's really there it really happened right right he's really there it really happened all right now listen we're supposed to have let's go into a romans 10. then faith cometh by hearing so somebody's got to speak it right and hearing by the word of god but i say have they not heard yes barely their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of god see if we're gonna have let's go to matthew 17 if you and i brother branham talks and to save time we're talking about now having a word revival the revival's over for healing healing revivals are over you understand what i'm saying sure they still have them but that's not what god's in god was in that at one time he's moved away healing campaigns are not god's program for the day let me put it that way his healing campaigns is not the program for the day we got to have them that was the foundation but that was back in that time where worldwide healing revival surely got things out there i'm talking about the bride the bride must now have a word revival where we feed on the word of god because there was a lot of people that was in those tents with brother branham and a.a al and all those people but remember when it comes down to when he started speaking the message the days of the voice when he started speaking the message that he was supposed to bring all that other stuff just went away right right that all just they left him in droves just like jesus remember when jesus said i and my father won what happened 70 left then this amount left then thousands left what he quit healing them he quit giving them bread he quit giving them social programs that's what it was but when he started preaching the word of god they said uh he's a vampire uh we don't wanna eat none of this and we don't need none of that or he's got a devil or they said the same thing to brother brown so same thing with you and i i i agree with brother dale when we get closer to the end time the bride's going to get what she needs to get out of here but there's going to be a revival out there but it's not going to be for the word they don't have a word revival right right the word's gone from them right they're done in 1956 brother brown said in the united states of america you're gone the word will never be preached you say well we've been preaching since then the true word of god has never been preached in the united states except what's in the bride i just believe that the true i'm talking about the 100 and it's like the brother said the other day he said folks he said do you think god's going to let us get by when one word put us out of the garden you think he's gonna let us get by with one word and put us back in the garden no we gotta take that word that eve turned down we gotta have that plus everything else all right amen and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall be it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto god my contacts must be bad oh it says you you that's right amen nothing shall be impossible unto you now let me give you the between the lines but if you don't do what i say and you don't believe and you don't believe in my word it's not impossible that's right amen i mean it is impossible everything's possible to those that believe right everything is possible to those that believe all right number 10. give you him let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this not on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word he's off the scene they will speak the word right they will speak the word and it will create itself glory right now we haven't seen powers like this and you think brother branham my lord millions of people healed raised the dead sick and he said it's coming he says it's coming we haven't seen powers like this coming this is 1960. coming into the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut it'll be a short time jesus come right off the mountain and what's he talking about adoption jesus come right off the mountain and went straight to calvary notice it won't last long but it will be here and i say that was 50 something years ago it's here now all right it's here you can count me a fanatic if you want to but it's here now it's something that you and i need to possess the fullness of the power of the holy ghost but we're not going to do it by running up a 2 000 cell phone bill let me go back to my stories these things happen for a purpose i mean he's not going to give us a cell phone the word and then let us run up a two thousand dollar cell phone bill no he's he's a little bit uh different because he knew that was gonna happen that that parent didn't know but you know what the parents should have known being a parent he should have known the results right see god knows the results that you and i are going to do all right you and i don't know the results but you know what he's telling us how to walk he's telling us how to do the things that we do he's telling us to do what to do and what not to do he's telling us not a man all right let's go first corinthians let's go to matthew 10. and you shall be brought before governor you don't think this is going to happen look at the power that's going to be in the people you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles that's us but when they deliver you up take no thought you don't have to study for three hours because you're not gonna know what they're gonna ask you that's right but he said take no thought how or what how to speak it or what you're going to say that's right for it shall be given you in that same hour that you shall speak now look the reason we have to study is because we don't have it a lot of times in here right that's why we study because we don't have it that's right but there's going to be a time come somewhere that god's going to do something that we're not going to have to study for hours but you're going to have to have it in order to speak it that's right you're going to have to have it in you that's right you're going to have to have it packed in your brother colleen what brother's been telling you for 50 years you're going to have to have it packed inside of you that when you need it and he's not here that's right or i'm not here you can't find no brother combined with he said he didn't say you get together and ask for the man he said you say that's right you say because you know what he's going to depend on you to use his word right because he's watched you in action what did he say to brother brown he said because the way you chose a greater portion of heaven is waiting for you because of the way and it was the hard way that he chose but it's not ye that speak oh it's me that doesn't it's me me me me me i me me me me no that's too much let me see i got something i want to read you you know what dl moody said one time i wrote this on the back of a card because i saw it in a book theo moody said god sends no one away empty except for those that are full of themselves god sends no one away empty except for those that are full of themselves amen right we got to be sold out but it is not ye that speak but it is the spirit of your father which speaketh t.h ongoing speaketh in you all right let's go to the next one first corinthians 5 and 8 we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord now that doesn't mean dying i want to be absent from this body you understand what i'm saying i want to be absent i'm not like paul i i don't want to be absent from the body i don't want to die but i want to be absent from this body and to be present with the lord see the problem with the people and i don't see a problem but the people that die and go on by the grave they go into the presence of the lord right that's right now those that are going to have their body changed that's going to have to reverse you're going to have to bring the presence of the lord here that's right in the same in the same real in the same real time and the same real person that you meet there when you go beyond the current time we got to bring him here right we got to catch up here not there if not we go there in his presence i want to be absolute from this body and present with god in this dimension all right not in another dimension all right let's go to number 11. and i'm going to read this is a long reading but now this was a this is something that i want everybody to really kind of wake yourself up and listen because brother brown had a vision and this vision was told in paradox and this will really help you because this is going to be we've been talking about faith coming up and having faith but brother brown is going to tell us what we need more than anything the angel of the lord told a prophet what's this and i heard the weeds mashing down and i looked and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds now i thought now this is a vision that i'll see what this animal or this beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as i got side of him i knew it was a mamba now bombay is an african snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poisonous as a mamba and the snake of course represents sin or death and death all right you got that that snake represents santa dead all right see and there's what we have in this country rattlesnake keep on going through there anyway a mamba they have all kind of cobras and but the mamba and you and if you know this as well as i do and i saw it on a movie one time or a video they come up on this big uh bull that had been bitten by a mamba in just a few seconds he was dead all right so same thing with with some of you that that you've seen snakes around here that mamba in anything he is he's death right right yeah 12 seconds is the longest you can live by being bit by a black mamba all right so keep going and then comes the mamba he's dead just when he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and he propels itself with the back of his tail they don't bite you down here they strike up here appear close to the hearts that's why they killed you stands up high and strikes hard when he hits you he's just you just got a few breaths till you're finished now remember this is a parable with an underlying meaning all right because brother brown was given a vision now he's telling the vision to the people they said them native boys when you you holler mamba they'll butt their heads together scream because it's death in a few seconds when one hits you alright keep going and here he was on the highway and i thought well what is it so i looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got real close to me he would run up fast and he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something would hold it he couldn't bite me and he'd turn around on the other side and try to approach from the other side and he'd get back and get a start and he switched right toward me get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop and then just shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me then he turned and looked at my friend and the way he went after my friend and i seen my friend just jumping up in the air over and over him and over him and over him trying and the thing was striking at him i thought oh if it ever hits him it's instant death no wonder everybody's so scared because when these things hit you it's an instant death all right and just then the serpent turned to me he said oh god have mercy on my brother when i said and just when the serpent turned to me when i said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or inning all right now mamba is like the apex and everything up under it is like second rate all right death is the greatest fear that man has cancer people survive cancer and all their heart attacks and all this stuff but when you say death that don't mean but one thing you about you've become absent from this body right and you're going to whatever place you're going to all right the voice came from above me said you have been given power to bind in the worst or any and i said well god what must i do and he said there's one thing you must do now he's telling a prophet he's telling a born-again prophet that he must be more sincere geez if he's got to be more sincere how about me and you there's one thing now look well god what must i do he said he's talking straight to the man or he's lying well god what must i do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere excuse me you must be more sincere i said well god forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when i raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something and i looked at the serpent and then he started toward me and he couldn't do it again and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus i bind you and and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him now what is blue smoke it's kind of a putrid pale color right pale horse rider you got your riders in here i don't have time to get into it i've lost too much time a serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made a signal like an ass capital ass backwards now you see what the prophet said an and sign and that means buying this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backwards ass that and sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free and i went over and mashed on it and he says you can buy unbind him also so i said then satan that i might know i unbind you and when it did he started coming to life again wiggle and said i bind you back in the name of jesus christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back again and turned to crystal and then when he did that that boy said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then it left me i was standing in the room all the things that a prophet faced death you've got to be more sincere than what you are and i took the bible and just pulled it open to my thumb was laying at first corinthians the fifth chapter and the eighth verse when something reads something like this when you come i was planning on taking the fast to the lord i told him i'd go out and fast said when you come to this beast which are fast in the body is a feast with the lord we know that so when you come to this feast don't come with the old leaven is that right don't come with the old leaven or the leaven of malice and so forth but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth just exactly what he told me in the vision come god is my solemn judge come with the unleavened bread now what is leaven leaven is sin right but he said come with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that is the word then i sing what he meant all right let's look at the last experiences 1947 i don't believe you can get too sincere about the work of god that's right more sincere you are the better god can lead you that's where we're failing if we're going to destroy death we've got to become more sincere that's what he said 27 division to destroy death you and i are going to become more sincere now here's my last statement the words have been stuck on the page for a long time and it's just been us reciting right repetition we just say this and we say that but when that word we become so sincere that that word and us become one and you can't tell the difference in the two right that's when we're gonna be able to behind things that's when we're gonna be able to bind death and bind the things that we have to uh you know what you start with your home just your glenn brother joe it's brother anderson and them they they go to your home clean out all the trash and start over you show i'm scared then you're an unbeliever have faith in god forget about what the other people say have faith in god amen i have to have faith in god i don't let my daughter do things in my house you know why because i have faith in god that if i allow her to come in and do them and i allow her to do it then i have partaken of her sin and god's not going to bless them that's right i want people to come to my home and relax and and be able to be at home and to be able to feel like they're home well they're not going to do that with all the racket going off and this going off and all these kind of things going on start with your home and then start with yourself start with your job go and tell the people and confess that i'm a christian i've done things wrong in the past and i may not look like one but today i'm a christian and from this day forward you're going to see a difference because if i act the same as i've always acted god can't use you i want god to use us i want these hands to be god's hands they were the devil's hands long enough i want these feet to be god's feet this mouth to be god's mouth i want that that's my desire so to do that i've got to become more sincere you may not have the responsibility that i have oh everybody wants to be a preacher they want to do this no you know what we got souls hanging on the line here we've got your soul hanging on the line that's just like me and daddy were discussing the other day if those preachers don't get that daniel 70 weeks right we're not saying we're right we're just saying that we can put the message with the bible and with the prophet's quote that's enough for me that's right that's god speaking in all three places and when god speaks that's what when faith speaks you've got to worry about what people come you don't worry about what people say i don't worry what people got to say because there are certain things in the bible that you can stand on but if they get it wrong then their whole congregation's wrong that's right that's right if they preach a trinity everybody in that church that accepts that will never get past that unless somebody does get a revelation somewhere else or hear something else and move or whatever but if you stay there and accept that you accept that doctrine that's right if you accept that doctrine you can't have perfect faith in error oh you can believe yeah some of you believed where you were right but when you heard the word of truth you come to that that's the drawing part but when you do that you don't go you don't just sit down in a pew and just no you want to tell it right that's right you want to speak you want that thing to come up inside of you and and be a part of you so much that when you speak the devil has to listen and it's not you speaking it's god speaking through you but you know why he's speaking through you because he can trust that vessel that he's speaking through he's got trust we're not babies anymore we're not drinking milk anymore sure i like a little bit of milk every once in a while but i like a big old steak i like a great big one i do not go to murphy's in in in oklahoma and sit down and drink a cup of milk for those of you that's been there you know we eat that big old steak now one may want some milk but you know why i've had an experience i've eat that before and it was good so i want some more of it amen in the gospel the same way i've eat from that right i've eaten slop before i've eat chopstick before but this steak is good and i come to the place where it's good i come to the place where the steak is good and the steak is good let's stand but faith must speak faith cannot be silent faith must grow you know what unless you're unless you're kind of odd you didn't when you were a baby you didn't have hair on your chest you had to grow something because you got what older get hair on your chest because you grew up right you've done things you were supposed to do you became an adult when i was a child i spoke to the child paul said but when i become a man i put away childish things the pampers wasn't in the closet anymore i didn't have to eat i didn't have to eat baby food because the desire in my heart was to grow the desire in my body was to have something that was better something that was better for me same way with the word of god people we're going to have to take this word and we're going to have to apply it to our everyday life and we're going to have to apply it to our spiritual life because we cannot just sit around and say we're in the message and we've got the word and something don't develop out of that something must develop we must be able to speak and go forward speak the word joshua told him to walk seven times and he said you speak right so whatever you say that wall is gonna come down amen and to walk him down right we got walls that we that we're dealing with walls that are called sickness and walls that are called things that we're that we do wrong and things that we that we are that we're struggling with but you know what those people believe joshua so much until they did what he said he didn't tell him to sharpen their swords he didn't he just said go walk around walk around the city walk around it seven times and then when you get to the seventh time just stop and blow the trumpet and shout now he didn't tell him that they needed a bulldozer and they needed it he just said go shop speak speak it from now on people i want us to speak this thing speaking and go forward you say well i might speak it wrong where are you mine but if something comes down from the inside i'll guarantee you it'll come to pass because as human beings we don't like change and you know what we don't like a lot of things that we have to do but you know what if it's god doing it there's where the rightness or the righteousness of god we have no rightness in ourselves so we have to have his righteousness we have to be eroded with his righteousness once we're rolled with his righteousness we'll do the right thing let's take a song ain't god good ain't god good to give us so many blessings undeserving y'all pray for us this week we got uh we got this weekend coming up and we want to really uh uh you know lay it out there like that said we even some of the preachers um admitted that it'd been 25 years since they've picked up a 10-70 week's book 25 years 25 years you know why i'll say it and i don't care if they hear it they're scared of it because they don't understand it right something you understand you keep with you the whole time something i understand i keep with me because it's a part of me brother gary but if i don't understand it what i do brother dick well i don't understand that well i don't understand that well i don't understand that that i don't understand hey we better start understanding something because it's the total plan of redemption that's what we're looking at because i want this thing changed we got redemption i want the total plan of redemption which changes its body right here all right this thing ain't got good oh yesterday thinking about blessings that god has given me just in my life uh um uh oh i'm um one more time oh oh uh honor god and god will honor you amen amen give god the glory when you're down in the valley and he'll put you on a mountain all right but when you're on a mountain don't forget where you came from down in the valley don't forget that part because that's the part we stay down here you know it takes usually it takes two valleys to make one mountain you gotta have two valleys to make a mountain so you're going to be in the valley twice as you're on top of the mountain but you know what when you're on the mountain boy doesn't it feel good right um foreign is is to come to a position come up out of this come out of her my people my people come out of her what that old church organization that you got he said listen folks speaking for your children speak it for your family speaking for your husband for your life oh there so far so were you so were you too far that man couldn't get you but not too far that god can't get you you didn't go too far that god couldn't go find you somewhere how dare us say he's too far gone she's too far gone no as long as there's a desire in your heart there's a connection somewhere with your brother with your sisters with your family when you're with your husband and your wife there's a connection there somewhere there's only one thing folks that'll stop and that desire will stop you from desiring that they come because there's no way they can god can't do anything i miss but as long as you've got a desire for anybody all they they've been mad 14 times they've done this they've said it they said we hate the message they said we hate god that's just that just learns that's just words of a human the words of god says believe jailor what do you want i don't want just me saved i want my whole household thing now a jailer a jailer had a desire because they were going to kill him paul said no hold on we're still here we're still here we didn't run off the jail said all that my me and my household be saved and i believe the bible said that it happened because they believed he believed for his whole family i don't think we've got desperate enough or sincere enough let's have more sincerity get rid of the unleavened bread let me get like the lemon bread and let's bring the 11 bread in all that is is bread and water that's just flour and water that's it so let's be watched by the word of the word believe for your family this is the hour that god can give to us and we'll just believe faith speaks faith will come out and it will not if you think god's gonna say something wrong yeah you might say something wrong but god's never going to say anything wrong so if you take this word and you say what's in here brother brown said he's got to back it up he's got to back it up and it comes from right here but if it comes from here it's your head knowledge but let's get all of our trash cleaned out so we can come boldly through the throne of grace and we can come up and ask that high priest to forgive us to forgive our whole household what did job do first thing job done when trouble started he started making sacrifices not for only him but it's for his whole family god if they've done something wrong we can't control their lives out there but we sure can pray that god will stir their water so bad don't even let them sleep at night until they come to this world and i'm not somebody just come to church i'm not going to come to work but they'll be in it and they'll be a part is you believe god yeah how many of you gonna be more sincere more sincere god's all in your hand if you're not he'll tell you that but if your more sins want to be more sincere then you know what god has to start working on that because you've spoken what you say to this mountain yes it's going to make a difference amen what you say not what the pastor says but what you say i have a mountain that may be different from your mountain right i need a mountain move for me but it may not be the same mountain that you won't move but if you have a mountain today you just believe you just believe forget everything else are we supposed to look at circumstances if jesus looked at circumstances he'd have never died he never looked at the circumstance he had a job to do i must die for the sins of the world that's what he was supposed to do and that's what he did he went to the cross he was done and now he's come back into believers now it's not just one jesus million jesus is now millions of standing here with the same listen to me the same words he had he said my words are spirit and their life if you believe god spoke to you today then i say unto you these words are spirit amen in their life let's power heads heavenly father we pray lord that you take what's been said lord and let it be applied to our heart and to our life and lord it would not return void but it would accomplish what it was supposed to accomplish lord do we become soft and we'll not be a bunch of know-it-alls a bunch of heady and high-minded people lord that will become soft and and lord you said you'd give us a heart of flesh which is soft and and lord is pliable and something that you can work with father
