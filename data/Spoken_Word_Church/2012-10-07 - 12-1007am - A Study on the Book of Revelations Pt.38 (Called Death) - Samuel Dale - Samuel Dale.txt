Heavenly Father we thank you this this day for your love and your grace unto us thank you for the hour that we're living the time Lord that that we can actually just be able to look around and see that's prophecy made known amen by seeing life and seeing the way it is and to see your word and see it how it's unfolding to us amen and we just thank you for all things and we ask you now that you would just come and speak to our heart as we read your word this morning that you would bless each and every one remember those that are not here and remember the sick among us because you said you would that you would come Among Us and give us your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction so have your way now forgive our sins guide us now in Jesus name amen we've only got one on the pole back there this morning so if things gets to running a little slow brother brother um Anderson is on the pole by himself all the others are out visiting so we'll make sure not to try to overload him too fast and call out things that you know it's slowly off but Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what is it time to understand now Revelation 6 verse 7 and 8 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the Peace of the earth amen you may be seated I'm glad to have Matthew and BV and Rel with us this morning that the Lord would bless right now we've been trying to uh lay down a pattern or a thought and I keep bringing it back to you because I want it to dwell in your mind you know of what we're doing and all and then you be able to follow after the understanding but we've been now in the uh opening of the seals and uh you know starting on through and a study on on the Book of Revelations and we've been getting a good bit of response off the internet Lord people connecting in amen and we pray that the Lord will bless you out there amen as you hear and uh check it out and if it's not right then send me an email and show me where I missed it out cuz I want to be right I want to I want it to be right all right now we read here that this fourth one remember we went through the seals the first one was a white horse then the next one was a red horse the next one was a black horse and now we come to a Pale Horse which when you mix all of those black white you know and red together you're going to come out with a Pale Horse but remember now that what our thought has being the rider is the same on each horse right CU it's exposing Satan right the Bible doesn't reveal now get the words you know you can use the word reveal that's fine it's not no problems and all but my point is to try to emphasize that we're trying to expose Satan not to reveal him because we're revealing trying to reveal Jesus Christ because the Bible is not the revelation of the devil right that's what people are trying to do they're trying to reveal the devil in his ways right when that's no good at all is to reveal Jesus Christ and then when we see Jesus Christ we'll automatically see the devil in his ways because that'll be doing so we're we're trying to expose him for what he is and what he's being and always has been you know Satan himself am and how that he comes down through the time upon the Earth he started out the prophet said there in Genesis said these seals open up down through time he said especially the seventh seal amen and uh doing that then we can look back there and see where everything started from right but our emphasis has been to the point to try to get you to see that we are not here when the literal seal itself opens amen cuz surely we don't want to be around here when Armageddon takes place we don't want to be here in the tribulation we don't want to be here under the sick seal and those different things you know but we look at it and see it unfold right I keep emphasizing that what I've always tried to get you to see that the Book of Revelation is the bride's book if you want to see yourself go in the Book of Revelations see now the symbols are broke amen the prophet tells us the symbols so now we can read the book of Revelation that's our book because the others was writing about of the times they were on the earth and things and even the apostles and the the writings but see we're down here where that the book is being unveiled or revealed opened brought into being to where the we can see Who We Are Amen in our day and time amen then like I've always said to you you know we think well boy it would have been something to been back there when Jesus was here or Moses was here or whatever you know but this is the greatest of all amen that's this is the ending up of all things amen the prophet said I'd rather be here than anywhere right why because we're going to be here to see amen prophecy is unveiling itself every day right in our eyes you know in the where that that we can can see what's taking place you know they even brother was telling me a minute ago they even got a movie out now predicting where the certain person gets president what it's going to be boy that's something ain't it and we'll get down to it after a while which this evening really would the prophet would say that the seal would be un would unfold or you know look forward and see it as it would would happen in our day and say it would be foretold unto us well sure you know like you say they got this they got that well what if they miss it that's what I've always tried to tell the people about the message you know that it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that I'm looking at it's not whether certain certain person president who's president or what takes place or what happens in the world or the Mayan calendar you know it's supposed to run out this year and according to them they don't have anything left right well I'm not worried you know I just have them to write a few more days put in the calendar as far as I'm concerned and they can go right on doing what they want to but see it's not the revealing of Satan it's the revealing of Jesus Christ right then you can see Satan in his tactics and his ways and what he's doing you can follow him because you follow Jesus Christ through the word it's got to be a revelation that's the main thing all right see then exposing Satan to where that we can see him all right see his ways and his actions what is the main thing that Satan tries to do you so what he kills he does this no he's discrediting God's word right if he can get you to doubt God's word he's got you defeated right right look at what they're doing now they certainly didn't do it when the prophet was here you remember yeah them that was when he was here they kept their mouth shut didn't they right oh yeah they blowed up a little bit but then when he walked up and said come up here with me right they had enough sense to shut up right and be quiet but now see oh he's not here so now it's not the world that's attacking this message right yeah right and they've left us alone right right it's the people in the message that's attacking the message well you know what I'm trying to do expose that is being Satan now wait a minute brother them a good brothers and sisters I didn't say nothing about that you remember in the Bible one time there a certain man standing there and the Lord Jesus said get behind me Satan right now was he calling Peter the devil no no no right what was anointing him at that time was the devil and he said get behind me well I'm not against anybody because I've always told you if God hadn't revealed what he has to you and I we couldn't be able to stand where we stand so it's all what he's revealing unto us all right but we see him we see him down through time we follow the devil and his tactics but now he's attacking the one thing that is the only thing that can defeat him right is the word that's right Jesus is not here in Corporal body that's right the prophet is not here to challenge the world right right but the word is still here am we'll get to that the end the word still here don't worry about it but everything's right on time nothing out of care it's all working just for God's plan amen right but if we'll just stay with the word you'll bring us through amen right all right now you'll see at the end of it the prophet said nothing can't def feat the word that's right but now remember what he says he say as long is laying on the pages of the Bible the book he said it can be questioned right right right but when it's revealed in your heart right and you become one with the word you can't be questioned anymore just leave them alone because you know they nothing done and that's what I'm saying about the the what Satan's tactics cuz you see what he's doing throughout the people of the message if they can't attack what he's what he taught they'll attack something in his life right y but don't they realize that's the devil right amen you know no I I know no I'm just exposing error what do you mean are you the prophet yeah right I I thought we just had one but you get what I'm saying see then that way we're trying to just stay with the word just hammer it down right to where we can see Jesus Christ amen revealed in the word and then we'll see Satan riding off right they go ahead and do all of his tricks and doings and all we just right on Amen you know believing it wonderful brothers out there that their thoughts and ideas of their own thoughts and ideas what does the word say Amen is the main thing all right now let's get on to the point do we see that the same Rider each time it's not a Red Rider and a white Rider and a Black Rider and a pale rider you know it's the same old devil the horse is what changes color right and in the changing of the color of the horse it shows what's taking place that we've been through it you know the the White Horse and the the Antichrist and the deceptive is going but remember now the rider gets off of the horse gets on another horse the horse keeps riding right it just keeps right on going amen it's still here when it got off the red got on to the black red one just keeps riding right right the horse don't stop right cuz that's the power and the things of Satan as he's working through the church system but brother there don't you think anybody's got anything I only know of one person that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's me right right I'm sorry now it's no good for you to say I believe brother Dale's got it they won't do no good it's not that right remember if there only one going you got to believe you're the one you're the only one that knows whether you're born again or not I can't tell you you said well we follow the word everybody claims to follow the word you want to go across the street and listen to the man will he say we're not following the word here no he won't say that will he everybody believes they fall in the word what are we going to do right I'm just going to keep right on going down the road and when we walk off the earth this will all be settled and all be finished up amen but now think about it the four stages of the Antichrist which is Antichrist false prophet then he becomes a viker or a pope and then he'll become the Beast y but you know I I love the points the prophet was making he can't be that Beast until we get out of here right that's right now he's the man of sinh he's the false prophet right he's the Antichrist but he can't be that incarnate false prophet of the Beast until we get out of here see if that bores you for me to keep emphasizing that then I'll tell you you don't understand that if it bores you because you know I still love to hear Brother Ram explain water baptism don't you you know right I don't get bored because of him explaining something simple amen I believe it and go on all right but think about it exposing Satan for what he is he's a devil right he's a demon he's all of the things that the Bible calls him the red dragon the different things and seeing him and seeing what happens to it right that he's defeated amen that's why I said there the other day today talking about it and when it comes down to that Pale Horse remember that's how God is describing him right right he's describing him as a Pale Horse amen we'll read in a minute sickly looking thing y oh sure Satan's got every government in the world under his control but they're blowing each other apart that's right amen yeah right every country is against the other country all them ruled by the same devil that's hard to understand isn't it but like some of them give up and got to give him no right demons won't do that n right no they all want to be the head man righten but think about it all the governments of the world are controlled by the devil Y show me one that's not right oh we're an American we're Christians H yeah but listen church it's not to see what's out there right right all right it's to see what's in here am that's right brother amen to see everybody in the world's lost ain't going to save you no right Amen to see you're lost yeah have a bless I've been in the message 20 years let me quote one of the brothers in the message have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe right amen who said that that was the Apostle Paul right yep that was the Apostle Paul that made that statement right all see to find out we're lost is one great thing because that's what we're going to deal with we get over to it death right death is not going to the Undertaker and being put in the ground right that Soul leaves that body and lives on what is death only the eagle knew what it was we'll get to that in a minute only he knew what real true death was right and he seen it and tried to preach it unto us okay let's get on with it see brother Anderson let's just jump over 1 2 3 and four and let me just quote it you can bring up number five in a minute but remember what are we covering that the SE is not to you and I right the literal happening right that's right but we see the Prophet said on the the paragraph 87 of the fifth seal the seals reveal what was what is and what shall be right the whole Plan of Redemption is revealed in no seals yes amen and therefore far us I hope you don't misunderstand my wording the seals is revealed to you and I we see them actually greater now listen right we see the opening of the by the opening of seals by way of the we see it greater than it will actually be when it literally comes right I I'd rather be years seeing it now than to be there when it literally takes place amen because we can see it more right why because this Prophet was able to go into the mind of God and bring out of there the Revelation to you and I that's why I encourage you to read to seal book I've emphasized over 40 something years to read it yes but read it to see what it's saying to you amen that's right when I finally read the seal book when I first came into the message I enjoyed a lot of what I read right you know what I done I put the seal back down because I seen I wasn't understanding and I went back to the church age book and begin to read and study that because I realized I wasn't getting what he was saying because as I was reading the seal book what I was getting was seemingly a man's Revelation right even though he would prove it by history I was listening to what's somebody say it right that's wonderful don't misunderstand this point that was wonderful right and when he said that the Bible had become a new book that was wonderful but I've seen people been in the message two or 3 months and say well it's something ain't it that the Bible's a brand new book well they didn't even know what the and said little Al to think about what a new book was see I admit I didn't see the new book right I seen a lot in the book that I didn't understand before right but I went back to the church ages and stayed on that for quite a while studying because of the doctrinal issues of the one God the the different things of serpent seed the the things that I knew that I needed but then one day I began to read the seal book as I begin to read the seal book I begin to see this man's not he's not talking about himself although you got to admit going through the seal book it seemingly that he's talking about himself but he said no I'm talking about the word right I'm talking about the Believers in the book right yes Father I begin to see that he was talking about me right right then I begin to enjoy the book amen then it begin to become a what new book a new book amen cuz I seen myself you know yourself that most of all what's preached about the people this message is to try to get you to see brother brandom that's wonderful that's a stage in your development that's got to be there and without that where would we all be nowhere right but when are we going to begin to see ourselves y right when are we going to see ourselves in the book and get away from not looking for somebody else right but to find ourselves right amen right in the word right and realize this is the bride's book the Bible is the bride's book The Book of Revelations is a special position thought or idea cuz it's finishing everything up amen right but you see those seals when they literally break we're not there right CU we gave you the quotes over and over and over and over that this is not in our day right the R would say on paragraph 194 the for seal this is not in our day to where he would go through and say the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 not seen till 1921 well when are we going to believe that right irregardless of whether we can explain it I can't explain how that a cow eats great GRE grass and give us white milk can you and you turn the milk it turned into butter and it's yellow can you explain that well you don't quit drinking milk do you no well that's what I've always tried to get the people to see see these things that we're on now of these seals they're not even in our day right they're after we leave out of here amen right but we see the Revelation how much greater could it be that's right the revelation of the opening of the word after the church is done gone home the prophet said that we see these things we can look back and see these things unfold I remember when I first was listening to kind of some thoughts on the prophet and what he said you know why that he did not want the children of Israel to have a literal King he said because they start bowing down before him that's right okay right he would demand their uh respect but it would go too far and they would have a oneman idea or thought right that's right when he wanted to deal with everybody am amen but mainly he didn't want them bowing down that's why he was so much against them bowing before Idols right cuz that would put something else between the people and God right he said what do you want a king for I'm your King right you want somebody to fight your battles I fight them all for you right but you see they still wanted a king yeah right that's right and they begin to bow down and they begin to honor man yep instead of God right well and good to honor man but make sure your worship first is to God Amen not to a man right why because that's what went on during the ages as we went through that it went from what Antichrist false prophet then incarnate false prophet our Pope or Vier as we gave you there paragraph 160 of the of the uh seal and then turn out to be a beast right same devil in his ways of getting everything done then brother Brown said I was going to preach a message called beast at the beginning and beast at the end cuz it was a beast in the garden right righten the serpent was the most subtle of all Beast right amen there beast in the End Amen right when Satan will become incarnate in that false prophet that is the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God and then when he does he will take over completely yep right MH not just a demon but Satan himself right you see Satan he's not a man he's not going to down in any form he can't create a body and come and live in it so he's got to use somebody else and he will but it started so easy so small and it's still today the same but brother Dale those are good Brothers you're throwing all on you know had a brother tell me when time he said well that's the way he sees it I said no no no no forget it now hold on a minute yeah the man I give him the book back I said he didn't say that's the way he sees it he said that's the way brother randam taught it ain't no problems when you say this is the way I see it that's no problem you can say I believe it this way that's no problem with me I'm not going to argue with you because you got a right by the Constitution to have that but when you say brother Brandon said it sorry he didn't say that right well yes he did well show it to me right well so and so told me they read it one time we were in the days of the computer when the so and so is out the door right what we used to think he said right is not exactly right anymore sometimes because your computer will show you up and you know what I mean by that we've been able to handle all of the things bring it all down to a message but listen Church these things are not in our day this where we're at talking about the foreal it's not in our day it's going to be later on when we get out of here right well then what do we need to know about it for because it's the Plan of Redemption amen yes sir right amen the seals are the Plan of Redemption we need to know the Plan of Redemption don't we well I'm not a Jew it don't matter to me what they do well then next goes to show you don't know what in the world you're talking about that Devil's done got you by his deceptive point and some false prophet preacher done got in the pull pit and prophesied you brother R said right into it right amen until you believe it believe a lie and be damned about right amen where are we at church right that's all that I'm trying to get you to see all right let's start on number five and just pick up a point kind of where we left off the other day that's what I said we'll have to using the brother sometimes and jump him up on some of but listen we've been over this one but listen very carefully paragraph 190 the second seal now now first then he became a become a f an antichrist but he couldn't be Antichrist only in spirit now what then he becomes an ant come an antichrist and that Spirit took a man that taught the same things that that Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he become a false prophet to the Antichrist Spirit right right and finally he becomes a beast now wait we'll get in that in a after a while you all right now if Satan's Trinity lays like that Satan all the time Satan Antichrist Spirit watching Antichrist Spirit incarnate false prophet then he becomes the Beast all right see and when not a demon that was in the Antichrist right he's emphasizing it y the Beast is not just a demon that was in the Antichrist the Beast is what but when Satan himself is kicked out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was the devil then yeah then the devil is Incarnate in a man it's just repeating itself incarnate in a man not just a an antichrist Spirit right you understand the emphasis that he's making yes it'll come to a place one day until that man won't be just a demon it'll be the Devil Himself amen that's right y he'll be incarnate in a man that's right he'll be the man of sin y Satan incarnate right why because we said the other day he can't create so he has to use something else that's right so he use the Beast and the Garden to get this thing messed up right so what it's going to be in the end to a man who has so totally yielded y until he becomes Satan incarnate amen well now like I said you say well well now you shouldn't throw off on these brothers or these people that's that I wish the devil could get saved right but I'm certainly not going to pity patter with it right you know I mean if he's the Devil he's want to be a devil he took that choice he made the choice all right then let him be what he is you be the devil incarnate yes and we'll read in a minute we've been over where brother said that beastly heart but brother look how good they do look what they've done here look like just done there I said Antichrist Spirit still riding right but look at the millions they put to death right amen and that's brother brand will'll read again in a minute where he said what and billions spiritually right right that's right amen amen and you're not against that right no we're not against people huh right no this that that pope of Rome I don't have any problems with he's a good man no doubt his life might be a better life than our life right but still he's deceived hell's going to be full of good people amen that thought they were going to heaven that's true but think on this now see not a demon that was in the false prophet he's emphasized it's not just a demon it's not just something coming down anointing upon people right when this comes to the Beast there stands the Devil Himself right you can only see the outside man which would be one of the popes right right mhm because you don't see God either that's right yeah to see him in Jesus Christ right amen so he's copying after or typing after Christ amen so he's coming forth in the end time to be a deceiver Y and he's deceived the whole world not just part of the world the whole world you remember Satan come to Jesus and offered him all of the governments of the world did he leave any out my mother-in-law she said one time said but Sam said we're a Christian Nation God's not going to let that happen to us well that was her understanding cuz that's the way they're Tau right but you see it's it doesn't matter how good the thing is it's what is behind it right you know mean they make medicine today tastes real good the best they can but it can kill you that's right but short tastes good going down well in the old days you had the the parag Gars and the and all of the the different things that we had to take you had a cro and CW for like what I have a lot of times you just best thing to do was to take a little kerosene and pour it over some sugar and just swallow it down and let it burn out everything that was there well at least now they got a cough drop you know put it in and it helps but see it's deceiving it's death all alone amen that's right all right look what he says now about this Pale Horse now remember the reason he's pale is because he's got everything mixed together right all the powers are mixed together y all of the white the red the black is mixed together that's right right that's why it turns out to be pale right amen and who would want anything my wife will be going down the road sometimes she'll look at the house you say why in the world do them people paint that house that color I it cuz they wanted to I mean yeah I don't care if they like purple or blue or you know mint green or something I mean but what about nobody wants anything to be pale right right right cuz what is that representative a sickly thing you tell somebody they pale looking yeah you tell them they're dark looking they said well I've got a sun toown you tell them this out of the other but if you tell them they're pale looking don't matter where I've seen it and all and that's what I asked brother collie one time I said how do y'all tell them kids is sick he said we get bail too okay all right you know cuz anything's pale looking is sick right always who would want anything sickly right and why would we want a church system that would be sickly right amen amen now the Bible speaks of the Prophet speaks of that we need to be what H hot right warm water make you sick at your stomach right but you're definitely not going to drink hot water unless you got some coffee of tea so the Bible speaks of being not that we're not hot and we're not cold right is that let you see right y it's not white it's I mean it's not hot and it's not cold right it's in the middle sickly y all right so this is described as sickly thing but we're going to see in a minute that it's death yes and what causes a person to change colors in their facial features well they're sick at your stomach they're sick at this or that the other right and you know what that really is that's death right amen you've heard the old saying is you know you look so pale and sickly you look like death warmed over that just simply means you're still kicking heart's beating but think about it a sickly pale thing mix everything together yep but even after you mix it together get my point I bring a while ago all the governments of the world are mixed together right y but yet they're killing each other right amen and every one of them control by the same devil right but you see it's going to take a devil then now I don't mean that a devil it's going to take the devil and his personification in the Beast right to bring all of these governments together right amen M you don't see the deceptive of of it now you don't see the things even in America you know don't say nothing about nobody hate crime don't say nothing about nobody oh yeah but we might not agree with the way they do but we're not going to say anything about it we'll read you after a while we get to it the prophet said that that's the deception right that's it that's the that we're living y m but somebody se's got to bring all these governments now you look at it we we'll get to it the Lord willing this afternoon on the Armageddon and the things and that's where I'd like for you to read the the foreal and show me one government that brother randam ever names at the battle of Armageddon see we got all these charts we got all these things that we've had all the way down through that the Antichrist is supposed to be a Syrian you know supposed to come out of Russia supposed to come out of certain lineages of this kind of a doings or that kind of a doings you know but when brother brandham come to preaching the battle of Armageddon he never mentioned Russia China United States or who right you know what he said don't you Protestants and Catholics y amen right well you know what whether you like it or not we're listed as Protestants right we're supposed to be the only protesters that are right the rest of them don't protest they sto their protest right they're getting alone we're supposed to be the only protesters amen the Protestants y well where's the forces coming right you know that in World War I that the Germans had in God we trust on their belt buckle brother R said them Russian soldiers standing there weeping when that person was raised from the dead and sick and heal said we'll serve a god like that right oh yeah all of those countries at one time were religious I'm talking about Christian countries what are we doing see he's a mixed up go to number seven brother I call the number just go and jump up a where you going okay number seven paragraph 197 of the second seal excuse me for SE notice the Antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color horse is a beast that represents the power his power is all mixed up y now look at his power yeah it's political is it's National Power it's religious Powers yep it's demon powers yep so every country in the world United States or whatever is controlled by those four things right and you'd wonder why he would even use it to say politicals then use it national Powers we look at them now One World Government y right right we already have the UN the soldiers the world we sended them to the world to police the world right y called a un y amen that was set aside to word that they was going to have no more Wars that claimed World War II was the last war that was to be done and they were going to get together and make a one world Army but everybody would commit so many people to that army and so much money and as they did then they would wind up policing the world that even if your own country started doing something that that police force had a right to come into your country right and demand for you to straighten it up now they're talking about a One World Government everything so it's got to get the stage you set you got to get all these governments that agree right he said well they're not going to never agree well they will when the head man says it right amen you know right amen true when they say like I was talking about the other day you go up there now and they don't like you and they just Mark your name off of that computer system and you no longer exist oh you can holler and scream I born on a certain day but they don't have any records of you being ever born or anything so they could just annihilate you in a hurry and then they can say that you you don't have no social security card you don't have no no records or nothing you don't get no money and and you don't exist so you can't buy our s big boy's going to take over ain't he right every government is under his control right right now to illustrate then we believe the holy spirit is powerful enough to be able to control right amen but just remember Satan is very close right he can control every people in the world everybody has got a hotline not to Lula Georgia put to work every government's got a hotline we got a nice one up there you know little red telephones and they got black telephones and they got hooked up to who the Vatican right sure you remember the article that who done away with Communism Reagan and the pope was in the newspapers magazines see they run their arms raced and pushed to work that they would break the country and if they had demanded the payment that day of our national debt we would have been busted just like everything else see we're going to find out one of these days the whole world of control by one person right right and they sure are fighting it out with each other because you know there is tales that this Pope today is going to die before the end of the year yeah because even their own records claim that it is but that's all right I don't know I don't read their records none of my business right you see that's all the deception to try to keep you and I fallowing after some something instead of following the word that's right you want to know what the what about the world is going to have read The Prophet's message there's no need of reading the government they're not going to tell you the truth anyway amen one day you got plenty of oil they raiseed the price of gasoline the next day you don't have any oil and they raise the price of gasoline I I don't understand that but it's all right listen church it's what what your Prophet had to say right not what so and so says or anybody says or what they print the newspaper right who was it oh I won't call his name but one of those big men way about years ago I remember that he was a head of one government over there and and this man come in and told him said we're in we're in a uh uh an economical crisis in the government he said who give you the right to call it that I think he had to guy killed but I know that he said who give you the right I'm the head of the country well the man was just telling him what was going on but see he was telling him you don't come in here and tell me that our government is going down well because he was bigger than the government right listen Church political Powers demon powers National Powers but he's still described as a sickly looking thing right amen sickly looking situation cuz there's no hopes right we don't have any instant peels to be able to go ahead with number number eight brother we don't have any instant peels to be able to you know give them to people to make them feel better it takes a Rejuvenation every how you stay of sales in your body to bring your body back into do it well there's nothing you can do for this government what 40 something years ago when the prophet of God said you could put a George Washington in every office about the country yeah right and he said you can't pull it out yeah he says you're paying taxes at 40 years from now before to be paid for that's right well how much is it now right what are we setting in the government but it's controlled by what now what I want you to get the point cuz this is the the message Point even though it's political National all kind of thing it's controlled by religious power right that's right amen right religious power deals with Mankind in his mind that's right like a man told me one day sitting in his house and I won't call his name but he said if I can get a man's mind I've got him and I thought you just DeVos your whole secret buddy yeah you know cuz that's what he was trying to do right you know one brother said about the man said somebody said something about said well he'd give away this he said sure you I'll give it away too if you'll give it back to me you know that was his pull but listen Church our minds are controlled to a degree by demon powers that's right yep whether we like it or not right amen you can holler all you want to that I am a Christian and I'm not controlled by nobody but the Holy Ghost amen that's in the soul that's in the soul if you're a newborn Christian we still got this old body and spirit out here that's of the world that's controlled by the world yes if not just don't eat no more yeah right is that enough yeah just don't eat anymore y That's being stupid that's what I thought you'd agree with but see it's true isn't it right W you let the Holy Ghost feed you well that's not well okay that's what I'm trying to get to that's right so all of these things are controlling you and I do you know that the end of World War II they had an ability to be able to fly over a city and electronically program The People's mind you don't never read or keep up with things you remember when the day came that they used to flash sub lenal messages on the TV screens about drank coke drank coke and they made them pull it off Y and even the man made the point then he said what if there they would say the pope is God the pope is God the pope is God y right now to express that in spiritual Powers you know that the devil right now is telling you this and that and the other and it would be great to go through everybody's mind that's in here right now and be able to express it I'm certainly glad I'm not a prophet certainly glad I'm not cuz I wouldn't want to know what you're thinking about amen some of you thinking about eating some of you thinking about we've heard this 49,000 times some of you thinking how many points am I hitting some are saying what in the world are you talking about right see Satan is controlling our minds now if you don't get nothing I you know I'll take this part death is a controlling of your mind the death I'm talking about not the death of that you know dying laying down your heart qu beting that's what you call death no see Satan is penetrating our minds and destroying us right how many of you prayed before you came to church today and ask God to be able to reveal things to you right amen yes and that's for raise a hand be embarrassing wouldn't it did you pray for the services today for God to reveal his word to you right now you think that's my job that's not exactly my job you know that's right my mine might work on my mind but it won't work on yours but you see that's why Satan's doing and that's death that's that sickly Pale Horse that we're talking about Satan fully on it strong the prophet would call it in the man of sin as the Beast Satan will be fully on his throne but what about leading up to that and what he's doing right yep you know that every person that is not born again Satan is on the throne of their heart right I don't care how good they think they are yes or who it is if you don't have the new birth Satan's on his throne in your heart right thank God that there is such a thing called a new birth amen that's right that can take him off of that Throne put him in the right place and bring him to that point right go down to number number 14 let's get on fist I'm down to number 14 because see I'm preaching what the quotes are up there but today I'm not using them as much you've already heard these things but listen to what your Prophet has said this is the fourth seal now he's talking about the fourth riter as being death and his name is death listen it was not mentioned of the other times of this riter but since now it's mentioned that he's called Death for seal causing death but under the revelation of the line now watch I want to read this close but I'd be sure wrote down the place not under the revelation of the line he didn't call it death right called it a by horse rider right Antichrist or the first age the early age this wasn't revealed the next age was the age of the ox which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as what it was nor the manlike Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther West and so forth it wasn't revealed right but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance to whom the secrets always come all right now the other ages the other combat Beast must not have known what death really was right now they knew about dying and they knew about the deception of the devil and his Antichrist movements and his beings and they could see the killings and they could see the thing but they didn't call him death right cuz just like Luther Wesley and him say coming down to specially end of th where Wesley and him singing about I know it was the blood and all your songs is written about the blood why because they believe the blood was what saved you but we found out by the eagle age of what it's not the blood that saves you the blood keeps you saved it's the life that's in the blood that's what saves you right right see then when it comes down to the end of the eagle is the most important part right but I must stop and express to that we believe that the you know as the the line we believe that was a spirit of God Among the people then when it was the ox that was a spirit of God Among the people then when it comes to the to the the L the the man that was the you know the ministry of God Among the people but when we come to the eagle we say brother Brown well we thank God for him bring cuz we wouldn't have no message we didn't bring but this is a prophetic age you realize that 464 the seal book The Prophet said justification s cre the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God coming in a prophet he was talking about a zeusa street man the oneeyed black man right he was talking about the age yeah he said but at the end of the age the messenger comes read it it comes down to where that we are in the age of prophetic you go down the road you see Eagles on everybody's houses this is a prophetic age you run for office go put in for office you know in your county but you better not have any skeletons in your closet because they're going to bring them out you know because they have the ability now it's the age of revealing right it's the age of making known everything why because the eagle age is here for the prophetic right brother rown come and brought us a message but you and I supposed to be little eaglet right right man right right that's why we're not deceived that's why we can't be deceived because we're the Little Eagles all right in doing that then what is death spiritual death right the prophet of God said the life plague that struck Egypt with spiritual death right there was Darkness everywhere but in Goan right amen he said the life plague that strikes a Pentecostal church is spiritual death right no spiritual death Y what about being so alive until everything is moving and everything is going and everything shouting Glory Hallelujah and all of the movements and the singing and the worship and you're dead yeah right that's a deceiving part of right I don't see how you can say there dead look how they shout Glory Hallelujah well that's wonderful maybe I wonder sometimes around here why we're so dead cuz we don't shout too much amen but the prophet said just make sure the way you you know you walk straight and you come back down after you shouting right M that's it's not degrading nobody that's just tell it like it is that's right amen you can see people that are so emotional and so spiritual and all but yet you talk to them about the word well I don't really think it's important for us to understand these things well who are you you know who are you what are you judging any about what is death see spiritual death is the first thing right you to die spiritually that's a whole lot worse than physical physical death is a horrible thing but not like spiritual right not especially in what we call the religious realm of it because in the religious realm people think that they are still alive and they're dead that's right right are you you saying brother Dell that only the people of this message are alive no I didn't say that and where'd you get the idea but listen spiritual death what about being alive but yet still be dead right then so spiritually dead you go out and tell talk to people about the word you don't have to get into brother rown was a prophet and all that cuz ain't no need to doing that I don't teach you to do that go out there and talk to them about one God and water baptism and some simple point that they ought not cut their hair or paint their face or it's some simple thing and they'll let you know real quick that they're not going to listen to you amen because see they're spiritually dead right amen you try to show the people of this message what brother around says they've got their own quotes their own ideas their own thoughts that's right spiritual death s in theuse dead not mention that his name is death anywhere but in the last days amen now you remember what I was bringing out the other day it says his name is death the prophet called it it says was death in the Bible you said but death is not a name but remember a noun is the name of a person place or thing so death is a thing so you don't have to write down there devil it's dead yeah ubod is posted on the doorpost right the glory of the Lord has departed right what about Cain the Bible says he went out from the presence of the Lord didn't say God drove him out he went into spiritual death yeah dead while you're living the Bible calls it spiritual death Y no wonder it's called a pale sickly horse cuz how much worse could it look no how much of a time or an hour has ever been an hour that it when it looks like it does across the land of America right is there any hopes of this governmental situation being able to pull it out the prophet said the only thing that Castro done had any sense at all to do he changed the currency right y right right brought in all of the bonds and the things and just canceled them and just bought things with checks but when they got to the bank the money done been done away with BL R said that was the only sensible thing to do he said it can't be done in America right he said so we got to borrow the money from somewhere now where are we going to get the money from amen right like I've always said to you I don't mean it's a joke but you say well who do we owe our national debt to well we just do it to ourselves well I I I'll write mine off and you want to yeah how much is it supposed to be that you owe me I'll write it off as being okay so now you know it's not that we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the Super for Rich y you know that even though Russia went and I read this so understand even though Russia went back R you know that there was more billionaires in Russia than in the United States yep where's their money wasn't in Russia right it's in America invested in all this that and the other it's in the Swiss bank accounts more billionaires than Russia than they are here and we think about Russia being a a third world country is being dilapidated and you know you better remember they were the first one to go to the moon and just remember because it communism was done away it never done away with go and Magog and never done away with Russia is still there waiting for the time did they do away with all of their arms and things and you know the military no but think about it spiritual death the last plag that hit the Pentecostal church is spiritual death jump over Brother Anderson to number 17 let's just end this up in the F few minutes this is taken from the message of speak to the Rock par e47 yes sir the death angel is on today let me tell you that's 1953 11:15 let me tell you something it's sweeping the lands this day what Death Angel is listen these churches and things that's having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof you find out they go in there it's not a natural death it's a spiritual death a natural death is not very bad but a spiritual death being separated cut off from God send away their day of Grace 1953 the death angel he said was in the land 1956 or 5 7 he said I don't pray for America anymore it's done send away it's day of Grace amen spiritual death is done struck go to the next one the unveiling of God paragraph 157 1964 614 morning service they spiritually die now this is a spiritual Veil see that was a natural Veil this is the spiritual way see they keep walking right on in behind there and you can tell them oh I know I know that but see go ahead it's all right it only speaks you remember the last plague in Egypt was Death Before The Exodus life plague on Earth is spiritual Death Before The Exodus then they'll be cremated and turned back to the dust that's going into the Millennium right right and the righteous will walk out upon their ashes but the ni thing is spiritual death what' he say rejecting the word now what is death an angel a eagle would call it spiritual death to reject God's word well I've got to right believe what I want to that's Constitution not the Bible right well you think you're the only one that's got it I didn't say that why you come up that right I've always preached around the world there is a bride of Jesus Christ to receive the message and preachers that will preach it I just keep looking for them trying to find them amen look at the next one Israel in the church 1953 listen paragraph 56 God then God fixing Moses getting him ready and sent out the signs then the last sign we taken we taken last night was death and we found out that spiritual death in the church last PL now Church drying up blowing away that's right we're living in a horrible time how at the church the oldtimers it used to be really out of the victory losing out dying out letting the blood off the mer off the front of the door when I see the blood I pass over you look the last one but this is the one I like there two more Discerning the body of the Lord what' you say not Discerning the Lord's body many are weakly and sick remember the sickly fil horse right many are asleep dead spiritually dead the last plague that hit Egypt was death the last plague that hits the church is spiritual death what we need today is a spiritual awakening amen A Spiritual Awakening to discernment right what is discernment Discerning what's going on right we need a spiritual awakening did the prophet say he'll take those seven unknown Thunders bring the bride to a Revival right an Awakening wake up the bride brother preach done it after one time a message on wake up the up the bride and brother Mo got up after him into the next service and boy you talking about all he said was he said the brother preached a good message of waking up the bride said now let's don't sit down and go to sleep and he got it for 2 hours from the other preachers that was preaching about and he was just simply saying the man done a good job and need to wake him up now let's don't sit down and go back to sleep but if a prophet in 53 would look at spiritual death how much more would it be when he would see it under the message of the end time of the sea Olden time amen he said no wonder I was against that and see would call it spiritual debt look at the last one though what is it rejecting God's word this is the last one 1965 220 God's chosen place of worship paragraph 55 and now the same is today there is only one place that spiritual death cannot strike Now read it there's only one place that spiritual death cannot strike right now if there's only one place it can't strike it means it's struck everywhere's else is that sensible yes all right there's only one place said spiritual death cannot strike that's the word right death can't strike the word now remember his name is death he's riding on a white horse in Revelations 19 we see Christ coming back riding on a white horse and his name is the word y right yeah but brother Dale the word the word word is not a name what is a noun name of a person place or thing and the word is a thing if Satan is death and that's his name is a thing then life is a thing which is the birth of the word now brother randam is not saying because like I said I gave you the quote while ago he said long as it's laying on the pages of the book it can be questioned right but see what the alive word can't be questioned Right There Is No Death in the alive live word when he comes back riding on the White Horse that word is alive that's not a dead letter that's not letters on a page that is a group of people who have become the word death can't follow the revealed word why would it be why would you want even deal with it right the word is death I mean if it's not quickly right because the scripture says it let her kill it but the alive word is a name I wish I could preach what I saw off of that but it just kind of slipped away from me because that's all right it'll come back Satan's name is death that's his name death cuz your name is what you are but Christ name is his word amen that's right is alive no wonder it can ride and be victorious yes because it's alive come on Brothers a live word revealed word quickly word is what I'm talking about not letters on a page right not what your computer can say yeah what you got in your heart right that's alive amen death can only be conquered by the revealed word are you following me death can only be conquered when the word is revealed amen right you realize what I'm saying that until we seen one God we were dead to that part that word letters was dead right but once it's revealed It's Made Alive to you right that's why I can stand on this message of the hour and declare that that Prophet was the messenger and it spent my entire Ministry basically defending the things that looked y contrary y right but to show that it's noten the revealed word Will Conquer All Things amen cuz death can't destroy the revealed word amen that's right amen there's no battle going to be over there in Revelations 19 of Us coming back as glorified people and fighting the natural people on Earth that's what's been taught in this message but show it to me that's not a battle right the battle is going on now right amen we're good to it this afternoon see there's a natural armag getting right under the for seal but there's a spiritual armag again taking place in your mind and my mind right now right right and it's battling out right and it's Protestants and Catholics coming against the word that's right right and you're looking at one and I'm looking at a lot is that okay well said it you're looking at one cuz you're looking at me I'm looking at you the carnal mind is at enmity against God right it's death y our ideas and thoughts contrary to the word is death Y no matter how good they sound or how beautiful it looks it's death y right man let's Stand Together think on these things the prophet called it death the eagle called it death right and then he seen what it was you didn't see it in his early Ministry what that death really was he said no wonder I've been against that all the time right see he's seen death they seen a worldly Church system that looks so wonderful and beautiful with it's sickly and pale Lookout death what do you think about it go ahead 45 in the spiral book anybody have a need what of Fellowship what on do we have life in or do we have death my ideas this word God is on the Everlasting oh believe our s believe she has a kidney infection we bad let's see whether death can exist over life life is God's word God's word said you're healed death is anything that

yet like she said she's facing all kind of demons that you go in there you know everything just going haywire and she wants everybody to pray with her that they that she could you know have enough faith and understanding and and two to not be negative in the point of saying well you know Mandy will never change well you don't know there probably a lot of people said that about you and they was probably thought that's true but you know if something happened and it changed it so let's believe see there our sisters got the right idea they want to help Mandy and them they want to help the whole

else before we go not service this afternoon Lord Jesus we thank you for the opportunity of being here this morning we pray that Lord what we said has been kind of scattered around because of our thoughts of what we want to bring out because we want to really see death and see what it is and see what it's doing in our human minds and destroying us Lord because that's what death really is but
