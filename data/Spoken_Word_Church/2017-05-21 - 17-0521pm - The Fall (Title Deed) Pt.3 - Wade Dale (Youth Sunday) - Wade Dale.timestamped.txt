[29:42] Kalani Ju Ange yeah Dave so I could say
[29:47] that hey man good to be here today good
[29:52] have a picture with us and made Lord
[29:56] bless each and every one of you we're
[29:57] going to continue our thought on the
[29:59] fall in the book of Genesis so if you
[30:01] would but we're going to take a kind of
[30:04] a strange first scripture today and it
[30:08] comes from the book of Malachi because
[30:10] today we're going to come on the angle
[30:14] of we're still in the fall but we're
[30:16] going to look at the title deed because
[30:18] that what we were but we were speaking
[30:20] the last couple of services we
[30:22] understood that that there was a lot of
[30:24] things that Adam had full control of in
[30:27] the garden right and then there was
[30:30] something that he lost in the garden
[30:32] during the fall so we'll back up a
[30:34] little bit but let's read the scripture
[30:35] in Malachi 3 verse 16 I know we're all
[30:42] doing well today and feeling good
[30:45] and everybody bring their spinners with
[30:48] them no okay
[30:50] I told them I - what we may do is we may
[30:53] just give everybody a little a little
[30:55] vial of nitroglycerin and you got to
[30:58] hold that because if you drop it fall
[31:01] asleep you drop it we all will be gone
[31:05] it'll be the last day here so so that
[31:08] way brother dent we got depend on
[31:09] everybody else to hold on to their vows
[31:11] so but we'll just pray that that
[31:14] sleepest period to get out of here a man
[31:16] Malachi 3 verse 16 3 16 and then we'll
[31:19] begin there let's bow our heads dear
[31:23] Lord Jesus we pray today Lord that we
[31:27] know you're here you were hearing the
[31:29] song service the prayer
[31:31] taking up at the offering and all the
[31:34] many things but now we come to a time
[31:35] where it takes a five fold ministry to
[31:39] break it down to the people today Lord
[31:41] we we pray that you would use that gift
[31:45] to give it to the people not so much
[31:47] myself but give it to each one Lord is
[31:49] sitting here today that you would break
[31:53] revelation Lord because that's what we
[31:56] desire is as the pastor we're talking
[31:59] this morning about a headstone in a
[32:02] cornerstone we know stone means
[32:04] revelation because that's something once
[32:06] we get a revelation my Satan can't stand
[32:10] on that Satan cannot have anything to do
[32:13] with that stone of that rock so we pray
[32:15] Lord that you'd bring us revelation
[32:17] today more than anything protect their
[32:20] Lord by your word forgive us of our sins
[32:22] may our thoughts be clearer and I mind
[32:25] be clearer Lord and our voice speak
[32:27] nothing but what you have to say for the
[32:29] people probably just bless the ones that
[32:31] are not here be with the ones that are
[32:32] on the foreign fields give them fruit
[32:35] for their labor father we pray Lord that
[32:36] you would take care of the ones that are
[32:37] sick the ones that are on the highway
[32:39] brother Joseph and them all today Lord
[32:42] with with brother Collins we pray that
[32:45] you just be with them Lord and take care
[32:46] of them on the way back let's each one
[32:49] take care of us and lead us into this
[32:50] service in Jesus name we pray we give it
[32:52] all to You Father amen book of Malachi 3
[32:56] verse 16 says then they that feared the
[32:58] Lord
[32:58] now look spake often one to another and
[33:01] the Lord hearkened or in other words the
[33:04] Lord responded to that you know Bob was
[33:07] speaking this morning about the sons of
[33:09] God shouting for joy well the Lord
[33:11] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[33:14] remembrance was written before him for
[33:17] them that feared the Lord not everybody
[33:19] but for him that feared the Lord and
[33:22] that thought upon his name so a book of
[33:25] remembrance was written so let's be
[33:27] seated the Lord added blessing to the
[33:29] reading of the word so we see that we we
[33:32] know one thing's for sure that before
[33:33] the foundation of the world by
[33:36] foreknowledge God knowing all things
[33:38] right that he would absolutely be able
[33:42] to write a book of names and what was
[33:46] going to happen while they were here
[33:48] before there was ever a Genesis 1:26
[33:52] development that we've been talking
[33:53] about amen
[33:55] that all right because predestination is
[33:58] not stamped it's not predetermined as
[34:00] far as this is exactly what you're going
[34:02] to do but by foreknowledge God could
[34:05] look and see what we decided to do and
[34:07] what he is going to do because his
[34:10] purpose his purpose is going to be
[34:12] carried out he's God and he changes not
[34:16] but we change but even the unchanging
[34:19] God could be able to write names and not
[34:22] have to change the names in this book
[34:24] I'm talking about the one I'm talking
[34:26] about is the Genesis 1:26 book that all
[34:30] right because remember there's books
[34:33] there's books and there's books inside a
[34:36] book Judas's name was in a book
[34:40] Jesus's name was in the book of life but
[34:43] Jesus his name was never in the eternal
[34:46] section and then that Genesis 1:26 where
[34:49] God created man in his own image we've
[34:52] been through that to past couple of
[34:53] services how that God so preserved that
[34:56] group of people that that was him made
[34:58] manifest in another form that was a
[35:01] group of people that is a special group
[35:03] of people that group of people did not
[35:06] include Moses Isaiah Elijah
[35:14] Malachi not belittling them but there's
[35:18] his 1:26 men was the soul of Almighty
[35:21] God and that soul of Almighty God
[35:24] developed are formed into another not
[35:29] another person but another attribute of
[35:32] God came out of him which was his sons
[35:34] and his daughters amen because when Adam
[35:37] came on New York and Adam was put in
[35:40] flesh and then Eve was taken out of Adam
[35:43] when we read in just a minute when Eve
[35:44] was taken out of Adam they were put here
[35:47] not to just be two people on the earth
[35:51] they were here to multiply I thought we
[35:54] read that Genesis 1:26 the prophet of
[35:56] God said
[35:57] they were even called the multiplying
[35:58] replace your not in human bodies amen
[36:02] you said well how in the world see we've
[36:04] got all that sexual thing in our mind
[36:05] that it has to be an act between a man
[36:07] and a woman why because we're on this
[36:09] side of the fall and that's how it's got
[36:11] to come okay now listen nothing wrong
[36:14] with that if it's done in the right way
[36:17] but it wasn't God's original plan amen
[36:23] we weren't to come here this way this is
[36:26] actually this is was not this was just
[36:29] permitted by God to get you here because
[36:32] of what happened in the fall and we'll
[36:34] talk about that since we'll have a few
[36:35] litter that are new among us we'll kind
[36:38] of maybe ease into that summon and I
[36:41] wasn't going to but I guess well now so
[36:43] in Genesis 2 verse 7 that we already
[36:45] took to Genesis 1:26 man and we showed
[36:48] how that that was that was like the Holy
[36:51] Ghost brooding over the earth but
[36:55] remember the Lord God formed man in
[36:57] Genesis 2:7 if you'll pull that up the
[37:01] Lord God formed man out of the dust of
[37:03] the ground and breathed into his
[37:04] nostrils the breath of life and man
[37:05] became a living soul now before that I
[37:07] said there was no man there to kill us
[37:09] all all right there was no man there
[37:11] that I look at it this way whether it's
[37:15] right or not God knew he was going to
[37:21] have children he knew one Adam and Eve
[37:24] would look like but yet the prophet of
[37:27] God said he was lonely until he brought
[37:31] something out that he could see because
[37:33] look you can have fellowship but you
[37:37] can't have fellowship good writely
[37:40] fellowship unless they somebody standing
[37:41] right here amen
[37:43] that's two fellows in the same ship
[37:45] that's what fellowship is and then so
[37:48] God had to being a father being having
[37:51] those attributes he had to produce
[37:53] something that he could see and I clean
[37:55] it and Purdue he wanted it that's what
[37:58] he wanted to do he wanted to be able to
[38:00] talk about him he wanted to be able to
[38:01] talk to somebody named Eve and man he
[38:05] wanted to speak to them he didn't want
[38:07] to just have fellowship what in the mind
[38:09] sure in the mind of
[38:10] God everything was already finished
[38:12] everything was already done he knew who
[38:14] all his children were who knew who was
[38:16] going to turn him down he knew who was
[38:18] going to be here on the earth and he
[38:19] knew the very day that the earth was
[38:21] going to end and the very day we walk
[38:23] into the future home but God wasn't
[38:27] satisfied with that if he was satisfied
[38:29] with that he would have stayed that way
[38:31] right here on the front row today good
[38:34] job alright so now you got to make sure
[38:37] I don't point up anymore make sure the
[38:39] point sideways okay because look God's
[38:41] not up here heavens not up here that's
[38:43] what we've been taught all of our life
[38:44] that heaven was somewhere to go and God
[38:46] was up here and it's okay to look up and
[38:48] pray but I thought Moses said he was in
[38:51] you naívi
[38:53] even in my heart the word of faith that
[38:55] we preach so we got to try to quit
[38:57] pointing where we're going up to
[38:58] something because like brother Dale said
[39:00] you know for years and years man has
[39:03] tried to prove it heavens way up here
[39:05] and God's Way up here and for all that
[39:07] times God's going no I'm I never left
[39:10] I'm right here with you you know the
[39:11] whole time so here we go in Genesis 2:7
[39:14] the Lord God formed the man out of the
[39:16] dust of the ground and breathed into his
[39:17] nostrils the breath of life now we know
[39:20] being recipients and I believe that's
[39:24] being recipients of the prophets message
[39:26] we can clearly see what happened in the
[39:29] Garden of Eden clearly see by the steps
[39:32] that God took he breathed the breath of
[39:35] life into Adam and he became a living
[39:37] soul because we're going to read this
[39:38] alright he put that Genesis 1:26 man
[39:41] into Adam that all right amen and then
[39:45] he became a living soul watch now look
[39:47] questions and answers number 1 now we're
[39:49] going to back up a little bit brother
[39:50] Anderson asked me he said he said I hope
[39:52] you're going to go back and back up a
[39:54] little bit from last Sunday which I am
[39:55] going to bring a few quotes from last
[39:57] Sunday to maybe help us out now the
[40:01] prophet of God said that now if a man
[40:02] was made something like that little
[40:04] sacred light yonder or something like
[40:06] that it could not be seen which is a
[40:08] spiritual being now what's he talking
[40:10] about he's talking about God unfolding
[40:11] itself from this great being that no one
[40:14] can understand how can you understand a
[40:15] God that knew you would be here what
[40:18] every thought you would have not the 7
[40:21] billion people that's on the earth but
[40:23] me just if he can you ever thought I'd
[40:26] have from a day I was born till the day
[40:27] I take a rapture just me plus all the
[40:30] other billions okay how you done
[40:31] understanding me somebody like that hey
[40:33] you understand somebody that's standing
[40:34] in eternity never had the beginning
[40:37] never had an end never was one second
[40:39] older than when we go back in says
[40:41] wouldn't God created the heavens and the
[40:43] earth and we know that there you know
[40:44] could be millions years old so we can't
[40:47] understand him but you know what the
[40:48] only way we can understand him is the
[40:50] way he gave us the way he gave us was
[40:52] the Bible the prophets fivefold ministry
[40:56] he gave us these things to help us
[40:59] understand him and actually came down
[41:01] here in human flesh himself to help us
[41:04] understand really how how to see this
[41:08] God because you know what he had after
[41:10] abuse at Genesis 1:26 is a total
[41:14] attribute of God now sure Moses and
[41:16] Elijah and all them I don't want to get
[41:19] you off on that because it's a whole
[41:22] sermon but but they're not sons and
[41:25] daughters of God like we are they were
[41:28] not born again in their soul while they
[41:30] were here on the earth they were what
[41:32] they were here
[41:36] anointed by God because the property God
[41:39] said one time he said David would not
[41:41] have had his best friend killed and
[41:43] committed adultery with a woman if he
[41:45] hadn't had the whole goat now he had an
[41:47] anointing where he could speak in the
[41:49] first person that pierced my hands and
[41:50] my feet as they did all they say sure
[41:52] the anointing fell you got to remember
[41:53] because when John the Baptist had seen
[41:56] that anointing many times fall on to
[41:59] Caiaphas following different priests but
[42:01] the angel of God said join whoever you
[42:04] see that the Spirit of God descend and
[42:07] remain amen
[42:10] the Spirit of God would go on Moses and
[42:12] it would go on and so much and it would
[42:14] be so much of his face with shine but
[42:16] when he stepped back the prophet of God
[42:18] said he was Moses and he was a murderer
[42:20] a man killed an Egyptian and man you
[42:25] can't get the Holy Ghost to do that all
[42:28] right but they were covered under the
[42:29] blood of bulls and goats which only
[42:31] covered sin
[42:32] it didn't eradicate sin until Christ
[42:34] died on the cross they
[42:37] didn't have a chance that's why they had
[42:39] to be in Paradise that's why there had
[42:41] to be a place called Paradise because
[42:43] look those Genesis 1:26 that's the
[42:47] children of God that's God soul and
[42:51] that's all inside of you that's God soul
[42:55] that's why you can go into that sixth
[42:58] dimension under the altar
[42:59] close to God and then because you're his
[43:03] children
[43:04] Abraham was never called the child of
[43:07] God he was called a friend of God yet
[43:13] Abraham as the father of our faith not
[43:15] belittling them one bit but they were
[43:17] not included in this part that we're
[43:21] talking about that all right all right
[43:24] here we go
[43:25] pull the question answers on Genesis
[43:28] back up now if a man was made something
[43:33] like that a little sacred light yonder
[43:34] or something like that it could not be
[43:36] seen which is a supernatural being he
[43:38] manifested are unfolding himself a
[43:40] little more to make a trinity of himself
[43:43] which we don't believe in a Trinity we
[43:45] know it's a triune of T of God there's
[43:47] not a separate father a separate son in
[43:49] a separate Holy Ghost somewhere
[43:51] it's one person a man and his name is
[43:55] the Lord Jesus Christ and here was God
[43:57] unfolding himself now down into let us
[44:00] make man which was his son and offspring
[44:05] from him man in our own image he was a
[44:08] supernatural being and let him have
[44:11] dominion over the cattle of the field
[44:13] and so forth now the man led to now the
[44:16] man led the man led the cattle and
[44:18] everything just like the Holy Spirit
[44:19] leads a real true believers a the voice
[44:22] of God out there now watch he changed
[44:24] that he really says he stopped he said
[44:27] the voice of man rather would speak and
[44:31] say and call the cattle and the sheep
[44:34] and all them in other words you know
[44:35] bade what Adam said all right everything
[44:39] obeyed him now but when there was no man
[44:41] to till the soil Genesis to no man who
[44:43] killed us all and then God formed man
[44:45] out of the dust in the earth now listen
[44:48] let's stop there second because let me
[44:50] go back
[44:50] my point guard using item was who Adam
[44:53] would look what Adam would look like yet
[44:55] Adam was an attribute of his but he was
[44:57] not expressed yet God wanted that to be
[44:59] expressed so he formed Adam now why
[45:03] wouldn't that go act to thee to the
[45:06] animal world same thing
[45:12] the animals were ruled by a supernatural
[45:16] being but not in it I don't think that
[45:18] they could see Adam in the way that God
[45:22] wanted him to see why would he put him
[45:24] down there why would he put him in a
[45:26] human body I don't mean got us don't
[45:30] have to peel the soul he can move it
[45:33] with his mind but he put him down there
[45:36] so the animals can say look that's our
[45:40] leader that's our that's the man that's
[45:43] the one that's leading us because when
[45:47] man fell that's what the animals did
[45:49] they look to us and said why did you
[45:52] fall because remember the animal kingdom
[45:55] never fell and then you and I are the
[45:59] highest form of animal there is if when
[46:01] we fell we took everything with us and
[46:04] then I'll show it to you in just a
[46:06] minute now but there was no man to kill
[46:09] us all so what was God doing God was
[46:11] allowing Adam to be seen by what the
[46:14] animal kingdom and then also he had to
[46:18] have what I helped me man we're looking
[46:21] just saying it was no man to till the
[46:24] soil then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out
[46:27] of the dust of the earth now we follow
[46:29] it he formed man out of the dust of the
[46:31] earth and put this supernatural spirit
[46:34] so he takes that Genesis 1:26 man and he
[46:37] puts it in the 2:7 man that all right
[46:40] hey man I'm gonna scare some Libyan man
[46:44] could you sleep him now he was laying
[46:46] there I don't believe y'all done fell
[46:48] asleep and it's only been 15 minutes
[46:49] this for you people we have a ball game
[46:52] on it wouldn't be yeah get your spinners
[46:54] out the thing fight it you're not
[46:59] fighting it you're wanting to sleep
[47:01] that's the problem get down get all
[47:03] comfortable maybe
[47:04] get a pincushion we could all sit on the
[47:06] pinkish y'all might shout and say how
[47:09] low you might run around the building to
[47:10] get set on a pincushion okay now he was
[47:17] laying there and I can have many
[47:18] pictures of it I can see Adam standing
[47:20] let's take this waste see him standing
[47:23] like a tree God didn't made him he was
[47:25] dead as he could be his toes like the
[47:27] roots sticking out of the ground so what
[47:29] was God doing listen this is this is
[47:31] this is nothing more than than than the
[47:33] elements of the earth and then your body
[47:36] is made up of every element that's in
[47:39] this earth potassium calcium phosphorus
[47:43] all those things your body actually
[47:45] comes straight out of the earth you say
[47:48] no I'm came from mom and daddy mom and
[47:50] daddy had to eat the beans mom and daddy
[47:52] had to eat the potatoes amen
[47:58] we came from this earth there's nothing
[48:00] new Under the Sun your body came right
[48:02] out of this earth and it was in the
[48:04] Garden of Eden we were talking the other
[48:05] day about all this other stuff your body
[48:07] was there too
[48:08] hey man property God said when Jesus
[48:11] laid claim on the arts at Calvary when
[48:14] he shed his blood he said your body it
[48:16] was in this earth
[48:18] that's your identification that's what
[48:20] we got local sentiment and God said let
[48:24] there be or breathed the breath of life
[48:25] into him and he junk came to himself see
[48:28] was breathed the breath of life into him
[48:30] he became a living soul now and he began
[48:32] to move on move on so God takes this
[48:35] Genesis 1:26 and we were talking about
[48:38] it last Sunday he takes that 1:26 man
[48:42] puts in the 2:7 man he has the masculine
[48:44] and feminine Spirit inside of him it's
[48:47] alright man because we look in Genesis 2
[48:50] verse 21 now before that God looks and
[48:56] he said okay everything's good I've got
[48:58] I've got a mom account at daddy count
[49:00] and mom a horse and a daddy horse and I
[49:03] got two of each and then but I've only
[49:08] got one item and in other words in other
[49:10] words to fully develop this picture I've
[49:12] got to do something else and then
[49:15] because I was telling them backstage
[49:16] back there in the back
[49:18] have you ever looked up the word woman
[49:22] you ever looked up the word woman okay
[49:27] let's read this in RT was it and the
[49:29] Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[49:30] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[49:32] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[49:34] instead thereof God is a master
[49:38] physician amen
[49:41] he's an anesthesiologist he's a master
[49:46] surgeon and I don't believe he left the
[49:48] scar when he closed the wound by God
[49:49] all right because he's the creator and
[49:51] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[49:53] from man made he a woman now look at
[49:56] that word woman that's a lowercase W and
[49:59] brought her under him and I don't said
[50:02] this is now bone of my bone and flesh of
[50:03] my flesh she shall be called capital
[50:06] letter WOM a.m. but you know what the
[50:08] word woman means a man with a womb right
[50:16] a man why do you think a woman is called
[50:20] a female she's a feminine male because
[50:24] remember God's a male everything had to
[50:27] come from God but to reproduce to
[50:30] reproduce Adam he had to have a helpmeet
[50:33] or a man with a womb think about it
[50:38] exactly what the female part of a man is
[50:44] called woman because she was taken out
[50:46] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[50:50] father and mother that doesn't say you
[50:52] leave your wife and cleave to you father
[50:54] mother we got it backwards this day in
[50:55] time no most people are leaving their
[50:58] spouse and going back home with a mom
[51:00] and daddy it says leave your mama leave
[51:03] your daddy and cleave unto your wife and
[51:06] they shall be one flesh
[51:08] all right now look you say Oh what is
[51:12] what Adam could never reproduce himself
[51:15] without that woman hey man there's no
[51:19] way it's powerful as powerful as gardius
[51:25] he cannot reproduce himself without a
[51:29] bride
[51:33] he cannot do it what a kite that's what
[51:37] God needs he needs what he wants he
[51:41] wants a bride he wants to be a husband
[51:43] and then that's why she wasn't a
[51:48] creation separate she wasn't a creation
[51:52] separate he created mama dog and daddy
[51:54] dog but he created Adam and he said Adam
[51:57] in order to reproduce you I'm going to
[52:00] have to bring something out of you and
[52:04] now what Christ did and then we come
[52:07] right straight out of Christ amen
[52:13] cuz look Adam was everything but a
[52:18] creator at that point he was everything
[52:24] but a creator you hear me he couldn't
[52:28] create a need God had to create an Eve
[52:31] because that was what the problem with
[52:33] Adam was and I see this because I go
[52:35] back and I've been kind of not want to
[52:38] act like Adam but you kind of think
[52:40] about you got to think about how this
[52:41] man was all of a sudden he was
[52:44] controlling everything I mean when he
[52:48] said elephant come here the elephant
[52:51] walked right up to him when he said
[52:53] elephant you don't need to be in this
[52:54] condition you need to go over here that
[52:56] elephant would just walk right over
[52:58] there and never say a word this one go
[53:01] over this way I don't want that tree
[53:03] there I want that tree moved now he
[53:05] didn't create another tree he moved and
[53:07] used because remember Jesus Christ never
[53:10] created anything when he came here when
[53:12] he came here he was a creator before the
[53:16] foundation of the world but he never
[53:17] stood here and created bread he used
[53:21] bread he used fish and multiplied oh
[53:27] that's weak okay some of them all right
[53:32] let's go questions and answers on
[53:33] Genesis but you see the plan of God is
[53:38] perfect the plan of God is perfect
[53:41] we would say we do in a different way
[53:44] and that's the devil if you say you can
[53:47] do it better than God that's what
[53:48] Satan's off Saints don't need to do it
[53:50] better than God explains that I don't
[53:53] think I want hi you know Eve you you're
[53:57] falling behind there honey you're
[53:58] falling behind you know the Beast is
[54:01] telling Eve's that you're falling behind
[54:02] there Eve you know look look at all
[54:04] these animals are reproducing and
[54:07] they're doing what God's Post told them
[54:09] to do and you're not doing it because
[54:10] it's just you and Adam you see what's
[54:13] going up because remember he had to get
[54:15] to Eve's emotion and talked to her
[54:18] brother Brent said if she would have not
[54:20] stopped and turned and started preaching
[54:23] to the devil come on somebody
[54:26] I mean if she would have stopped she did
[54:29] stop start preaching to the devil if she
[54:31] would have said let me go get my head
[54:33] let me go get at him and let's see what
[54:36] he has to say about this situation but
[54:39] no he he what he pride on her emotion
[54:42] amen
[54:44] let's read this and God take it from his
[54:46] side a piece of him a rib
[54:47] I made a woman now where did get the
[54:50] spirit woman see Genesis 1:26 he said
[54:53] let us make man in our own image after
[54:54] our own whiteness created him man male
[54:57] and female he made the burly spirit for
[54:59] the man he made the tender little
[55:00] delicate feminist spirit for the woman
[55:02] so he knew he was going to have some
[55:05] women that we've read this a couple of
[55:06] times I want you to see he knew
[55:09] foreknowledge he knew he was going to
[55:12] have some women so he just made this
[55:14] spirit right there the Bible said he
[55:17] would in 1 Genesis 1:26 she created in
[55:20] him man in a pre figure male and female
[55:23] a man see in a pre figure he made the
[55:27] woman and the man before they was ever
[55:29] formed out of the dust of the earth
[55:31] that's the Genesis 1:26 man and when God
[55:34] made the man not in his own image his
[55:36] body is not in the image of God his body
[55:39] is in the image of Beast a man now let's
[55:43] go to the next one to read it shorts the
[55:46] father 1953 now look when man was made
[55:49] in the image of God he did not fall
[55:52] remember the Genesis 1:26 men cannot
[55:55] fall never started to
[55:57] the ball never will fall we'll take some
[56:03] people it's that'll anchor in your soul
[56:06] one time that's why I love Genesis 1:26
[56:09] because that is telling me I cannot fall
[56:13] I cannot fail you just hadn't read
[56:19] Romans one in a while heavy Romans 8:1
[56:21] there therefore now what oh we can quote
[56:26] it we can quote it but can we live it
[56:32] but man was made in the image of God he
[56:34] did not fall when he was made in the
[56:37] image of I mean we made in the image of
[56:39] God he did not fall when he was made in
[56:42] the image of man he felt when he was
[56:44] made in the image of beasts or out of
[56:46] the dust of the earth that's where he
[56:48] fell amen and for the ones that have
[56:52] come here today I'm going to try to
[56:54] explain in a in a simplistic form what
[56:58] happened in the fall because it's really
[57:01] important that that we don't see that it
[57:04] was some type of fruit that man ate or
[57:06] fruit that woman ate if it was fruit
[57:09] then see listen if whatever made us fall
[57:12] something's going to have to turn us and
[57:14] bring us back and then so if we eat if
[57:18] Eve eat an apple or whatever kind of
[57:20] fruit you want to talk about because
[57:21] remember you got to remember one thing
[57:23] Moses wrote this to hide it from the
[57:26] eyes of the wise and prudent if you
[57:28] didn't know that Moses wrote the first
[57:29] five books of the Bible
[57:30] so Moses was the common commentator
[57:33] writing what you're reading today a man
[57:36] and he wrote it several hundred thousand
[57:38] several thousand years after it happened
[57:41] so God let him go back in a vision and
[57:44] see what went on and he wrote down what
[57:47] God told him to write and remember one
[57:50] thing for sure you are the fruit of your
[57:53] mother you are the fruit of the
[57:55] production of your father and then by
[57:59] what by sexual desire on this side of
[58:01] the fall a man but before it wasn't
[58:04] going to be by sex it was going to by me
[58:07] by the spoken word of God
[58:10] but keep in mind he still had to have a
[58:13] bribe to produce it he still had to have
[58:16] the woman to produce his whole thing
[58:22] when man fell he fell in the image of
[58:27] Beast which was creative evolution hey
[58:30] man y'all have to really Amen these okay
[58:33] just say Amen
[58:36] pitiful amen amen
[58:38] God come from here I told Bobby I come
[58:41] from here you got to bring it out come
[58:43] from here all right that's good that was
[58:48] okay but God in creative evolution
[58:53] created this one remember he wrote it in
[58:55] the Bible water water animals land
[58:59] animals our sky animals land animals and
[59:02] then he comes over and then he brings
[59:06] man in Genesis 2:7 is that Alright just
[59:08] for a minute just for the just for the
[59:10] ones that are here with us today so I do
[59:12] believe in evolution but not like
[59:14] Darwin's evolution that this one evolved
[59:16] from this one no God in creative
[59:18] evolution he created it right up to the
[59:20] monkey or the chimpanzee and then we've
[59:22] always in school you sit there and you
[59:25] talk about a missing link between monkey
[59:29] and man I heard it I heard it with my
[59:32] own ears because it's all about the
[59:33] missing link they showed all the was a
[59:36] pro Magnum man and this man and this man
[59:38] it looked more like a look more like a
[59:41] monkey and this look like more like man
[59:43] and this looked more like man and then
[59:46] something happened there was a gap in
[59:50] there because man cannot procreate with
[59:53] an animal an animal can't procreate with
[59:55] man but in creative evolution God had in
[59:57] creative evolution he had to what stay
[1:00:00] in continuity there's one thing about
[1:00:01] God he never changes a man
[1:00:04] so in creative evolution because look a
[1:00:06] dog a doesn't matter if it's a chihuahua
[1:00:09] or a Great Dane they can procreate
[1:00:12] because they're in the same genus or in
[1:00:14] the same species right then all right at
[1:00:16] one going here but but we're going to do
[1:00:18] it for a minute so they're in the same
[1:00:20] species so they can procure
[1:00:21] gave that way right right then you come
[1:00:24] up and you'd say there's a gap here then
[1:00:27] you got man and woman but in creative
[1:00:30] evolution there's that missing link then
[1:00:33] something must be missing if it's a
[1:00:35] missing link a man the missing link was
[1:00:38] the beast in the garden in Genesis which
[1:00:43] was called at that time a serpent that's
[1:00:45] alright but he was smarter than any
[1:00:48] beast in the field even Scofield will
[1:00:51] tell you in chapter 3 now they don't
[1:00:54] have this but it had to be an upright
[1:00:58] creature a man an upright creature the
[1:01:02] missing leg the one going from the
[1:01:04] monkey a little bit more and a little
[1:01:06] bit more like a man and then you see
[1:01:08] Adam and then you see there's something
[1:01:11] in between that can flop over to their
[1:01:13] side or flop over to this side that's
[1:01:19] not so far fish and remember Satan is
[1:01:25] not a creator God's the only creator so
[1:01:28] Satan had to borrow a seed he had to
[1:01:31] borrow a beast he had to enter into that
[1:01:35] beast and then he had to take him over
[1:01:38] and then and cause him remember he was a
[1:01:42] gum brute he was a dumb animal but he
[1:01:45] was so close to the human side because
[1:01:47] they know science knows that that
[1:01:49] missing link is the link between animal
[1:01:52] and man so they must be there soon real
[1:01:55] close together amen
[1:01:57] done all right all right so what
[1:02:00] happened is Satan being right there next
[1:02:02] to God there all right being right there
[1:02:06] next to God he knew the principles of
[1:02:09] life well my heavens if he had a he had
[1:02:11] eyes he could see the the dog and the
[1:02:13] mama dog innovate and the daddy dog
[1:02:16] having puppies he could see this one
[1:02:18] over here even miss mr. and mrs. beasts
[1:02:20] having children he said how you know
[1:02:24] that well we're going to we may read it
[1:02:26] if we get to it that God came down and
[1:02:28] killed the lamb and throwed it into the
[1:02:30] end of the bushes well if I'd have been
[1:02:32] only mama lamb and Daddy lamb they'd be
[1:02:34] no lambs left
[1:02:35] a man so we know for a fact that there
[1:02:37] was procreation going on because
[1:02:39] remember procreation and animal kingdom
[1:02:42] it's not filthy is on our right because
[1:02:45] they have no conscience if you see that
[1:02:47] in the in the in the world where we we
[1:02:50] try to reproduce the best best and the
[1:02:51] best data we use this and we manipulate
[1:02:54] this to that and it's not vulgar right
[1:02:59] but with a man and a woman with a soul
[1:03:02] they can't go out and plaster you
[1:03:04] understand what I'm saying because
[1:03:06] that's vulgar because why because we
[1:03:08] have a conscious a man the Beast has no
[1:03:12] conscious a dog has no conscious right a
[1:03:15] dogsled by what by nature not a not an
[1:03:20] emotion that's why the woman that's why
[1:03:22] saying to look and say if I'm going to
[1:03:24] get to that woman Eve I can't go to Adam
[1:03:28] he had enough sense to know that Adam
[1:03:31] had this supernatural part about him
[1:03:33] that he was a little bit more on the
[1:03:36] spiritual side than the emotional side
[1:03:40] that all right can we do this okay
[1:03:44] so Satan enters into the beast because
[1:03:46] I'm sure that the beast being so close
[1:03:50] to the human that he was maybe used not
[1:03:55] as a servant but if he could he could
[1:03:58] move like a human the anatomy would be
[1:04:03] in other words that you could look down
[1:04:04] the line and you go man he's this
[1:04:06] person's close to us so Satan says yeah
[1:04:09] this is where I'll go I'm so handy in
[1:04:11] unto the Beast now the serpent was more
[1:04:14] subtil than any beast of the field and
[1:04:18] he said unto the woman so this guy must
[1:04:21] be able to talk he said to the woman yea
[1:04:25] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[1:04:27] tree of the garden
[1:04:28] now that was Satan's question to you and
[1:04:31] the woman sent or the woman she wasn't
[1:04:34] easier and the woman said unto the
[1:04:36] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:04:40] trees of the garden God told them he
[1:04:44] said eat everything it comes out of that
[1:04:45] off of those trees except one
[1:04:49] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:04:51] the midst of the garden God said you
[1:04:55] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:04:57] touch it why would you want to touch the
[1:04:59] tree and cause the fall why would you
[1:05:02] want to touch a piece of fruit and it
[1:05:03] caused all this that's a destruction no
[1:05:05] no no no no and the Serpent's enter the
[1:05:08] woman ye shall not surely die that word
[1:05:15] not one word because God said you shall
[1:05:19] surely die you touch that you're going
[1:05:20] to die the day you eat thereof the day
[1:05:23] you're going to die and then for God
[1:05:26] doth know that in the day you eat there
[1:05:29] I've listened to Satan then your eyes
[1:05:32] shall be opened and ye shall be as God's
[1:05:34] knowing good and evil
[1:05:39] while knowledge how knowledge is power
[1:05:44] even may be thought you can know
[1:05:46] something the little before Adam that
[1:05:50] all right and when the woman saw that
[1:05:54] the tree was good for food and it was
[1:05:57] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:05:59] desired not was that they never been an
[1:06:01] apple tree I walked up to and desired it
[1:06:04] hello there's not a fruit tree I got
[1:06:08] some pretty apple trees but I have never
[1:06:10] desired that tree so you understand what
[1:06:12] happened let's just put in plain
[1:06:14] language Satan entered the Beast the
[1:06:16] Beast talk to Eve got Eve to procreate
[1:06:18] with hurt with him and that's what
[1:06:22] caused the ball God said don't touch it
[1:06:27] and she did all right now let's go
[1:06:32] forward to Genesis 3:14 not all right
[1:06:38] well okay we didn't been through this a
[1:06:39] lot we know it was we know it was a
[1:06:41] sexual affair between even the beasts
[1:06:43] and the gardens while government's whole
[1:06:44] thing started that all right and man we
[1:06:48] don't you know you said well that's what
[1:06:49] we believe no that's what the Bible says
[1:06:51] that's what the Bible says that's not
[1:06:53] what I believe sure I believe it I
[1:06:55] believe it cousin what the Bible said
[1:06:56] and then because if you look through
[1:06:58] I've got it many many times in the Bible
[1:07:00] it talks about
[1:07:01] the fruit of the womb you are the fruit
[1:07:04] of the womb that's why don't touch that
[1:07:06] proof God said don't even pur take eat
[1:07:10] means to partake don't pertain to that
[1:07:13] stay away from it in other words listen
[1:07:16] God you're going to create we're going
[1:07:18] to be procreating anyway but it's not my
[1:07:21] sexual desire but by the spoken word of
[1:07:24] God just like it is right now
[1:07:26] amen and the Lord God said unto the
[1:07:30] serpent because thou has done this thou
[1:07:32] art cursed above all cattle remember he
[1:07:34] was the Beast and above every beast of
[1:07:36] the field upon thy belly shalt thou go
[1:07:38] he wasn't a snake to start with and then
[1:07:42] he was an upright beast he was that
[1:07:43] missing link above every beast of the
[1:07:47] field upon thy belly shalt thou go the
[1:07:50] property God said God changed his whole
[1:07:52] skeletal structure so that nobody would
[1:07:56] ever know that that that ever existed
[1:07:59] because remember a snake doesn't have
[1:08:01] what shoulders a snake doesn't have hips
[1:08:04] but you got all these other animals like
[1:08:06] a bear and a lion they have hips to have
[1:08:08] shoulders right but that snake has
[1:08:10] nothing but a head in the tail and one
[1:08:13] long vertebra nothing like me and you so
[1:08:15] there was everything God did he hit it
[1:08:17] from the wise and prudent hey man
[1:08:23] it's not foolish you can go all the way
[1:08:25] through the Bible amen
[1:08:27] all the way through the Bible and
[1:08:29] remember to remember Adam was not
[1:08:31] deceived Eve was the one that was to see
[1:08:34] the Lord God said to the serpent because
[1:08:37] thou hast done this thou art cursed
[1:08:39] above all cattle about ever above every
[1:08:41] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[1:08:44] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[1:08:46] days of my life now that is not just at
[1:08:49] that snake live and was on his belly and
[1:08:52] died that snake is the trail of that
[1:08:55] serpents it goes all the way all the way
[1:08:59] to white throne almost to the white
[1:09:01] throne judgment that Alright cuz look
[1:09:04] he's eating your dust
[1:09:07] we're going to the ground because what
[1:09:09] happened we are going to the dust and
[1:09:12] Satan is the one that's putting us there
[1:09:15] God puts you in there yep Satan put you
[1:09:19] in the ground okay because of the
[1:09:23] effects of the fall and God sent a list
[1:09:26] and I will put enmity already division
[1:09:29] between then the woman now watch between
[1:09:33] then the woman he is who the serpent
[1:09:37] alright
[1:09:38] the Serpent and the woman I'll put
[1:09:41] enmity between you and between thy seed
[1:09:45] now look Satan didn't have a seed that's
[1:09:48] when he got from the Beast because
[1:09:50] remember Satan is not a creator he had
[1:09:52] to use something that God had already
[1:09:54] brought listen everything is a
[1:09:56] perversion amen everything Satan is not
[1:10:03] an original anything he didn't originate
[1:10:07] one thing never will originate one thing
[1:10:10] never cannot originate one thing because
[1:10:13] he's not a creator I mean man even even
[1:10:18] Einstein prove it that darkness is not a
[1:10:21] creation it's just an absence of light
[1:10:23] hey man like the property God said he
[1:10:29] said relations between a man and a woman
[1:10:32] as a wife no problem he said but if you
[1:10:35] take the adultery part of it or you take
[1:10:38] a prostitute he said that's where you go
[1:10:40] wrong and then properly God tells us the
[1:10:43] riot act perverting a man the right act
[1:10:46] perverted now we'll put in with you why
[1:10:48] because it's a right orig everything of
[1:10:50] God is original and then Satan is just a
[1:10:53] copycat right behind it I promise you if
[1:10:55] say never brings you something if state
[1:10:57] never brings you something remember
[1:10:58] there's an original to come back there's
[1:11:01] an original to say get behind me Satan
[1:11:03] and then excuse me between thy seed and
[1:11:07] her seed now she didn't have a seat
[1:11:09] all right a woman is not a seed producer
[1:11:13] then all right
[1:11:15] a woman produces an egg which has no
[1:11:18] life in it
[1:11:19] that Alright wiggling muscles the
[1:11:22] property got there but no life the life
[1:11:24] is in the seed what says in her seed
[1:11:28] this is a promise of Jesus Christ the
[1:11:32] seed of the woman a man woman doesn't
[1:11:35] have a seat so it was somebody Bible so
[1:11:38] much this morning
[1:11:39] be it unto me according to thy word Mary
[1:11:41] said and what God forgives the egg and
[1:11:43] the sperm put it in the womb of Mary man
[1:11:47] had nothing to do with it there goes my
[1:11:49] God creating again a man Satan thought
[1:11:54] he had him fooled he was just fulfilling
[1:11:57] the plan of God and then in between thy
[1:12:01] seed and her seed and it shall bruise
[1:12:03] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:12:06] a Calvary Satan Bruce listen you can't
[1:12:08] kill somebody by bruising their heel we
[1:12:12] hit him in the head one time it shall
[1:12:15] bruise thy head Satan we're goin
[1:12:18] straight to the head because remember
[1:12:19] Satan chose the head God chose the heart
[1:12:22] and he's going to what bruise his heel
[1:12:25] which is his flesh right while he's on
[1:12:28] earth but look at mighty conquer at
[1:12:32] woman seed out of that woman's seed look
[1:12:35] what he produced children the way it was
[1:12:39] supposed to be until the woman he said I
[1:12:41] will greatly now remember before the
[1:12:43] fall the woman and the man was together
[1:12:48] and then but now that was the Covenant
[1:12:51] don't eat that tree and you'll be fine
[1:12:53] we're reading just a few minutes Adam
[1:12:56] and Eve in the garden as long as they
[1:12:58] ate from the tree of life their use was
[1:13:01] being renewed amen
[1:13:03] now look they didn't have eternal life
[1:13:04] and nurse in their body not at the time
[1:13:08] amen right until the woman he said I
[1:13:13] will greatly multiply myself now why is
[1:13:16] he going to start in the conception and
[1:13:18] sorrow thou shalt bring forth children I
[1:13:21] thought God was glad to bring some
[1:13:23] children out that Genesis 1:26 men if I
[1:13:26] had been God I would have shouted for
[1:13:28] joy and they'd have been shot still be
[1:13:30] she'll go that's my children
[1:13:33] it's coming for for me I mean how we
[1:13:36] shot with our own natural children amen
[1:13:39] until they get older
[1:13:41] didn't we cry doesn't woman he said I
[1:13:47] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:13:48] conception in sorrow thou shalt bring
[1:13:51] forth children now nothing coming from
[1:13:53] God's going to be sorrowful the reason
[1:13:55] this is because of the choice you made
[1:13:56] and then she's gonna have to now start
[1:13:59] bringing children through her nice
[1:14:00] natural womb not the loom of her mind
[1:14:03] because the womb of her mind was
[1:14:05] polluted first and then her body just
[1:14:07] followed right after that mmm cuz
[1:14:12] remember listen you cannot sin in just
[1:14:16] your flesh
[1:14:19] you cannot sin just in your flesh your
[1:14:23] flesh don't sin it's a product of sin
[1:14:28] but it cannot sin I sin in my inner man
[1:14:32] my inner man and then what happens is if
[1:14:35] I don't have any kind of buffer if I
[1:14:37] don't have the Holy Ghost to hold me
[1:14:39] what when I was out in the world you
[1:14:41] know if I wanted to go to a bar and buy
[1:14:43] a beer by didn't bother me one bit and I
[1:14:46] didn't drink that much but it didn't
[1:14:48] bother me I had no conscience now I
[1:14:51] don't even want to go but the same man
[1:14:54] that held him in I said many times
[1:14:56] before the same the same mouth used to
[1:14:58] curse people and kill them I hope now is
[1:15:01] the same mouth is used to maybe bring
[1:15:02] somebody to go it and do some good amen
[1:15:06] but God didn't wash my mouth out with
[1:15:08] soap he washed my mouth out with the
[1:15:10] Holy Ghost inside of me so what comes
[1:15:12] out of here from here God said out of
[1:15:15] the white belly out of the inward man
[1:15:18] and then that same man that used to
[1:15:21] speak lies and used to speak of cursing
[1:15:26] thank God you see right here I didn't
[1:15:29] set there and brush my teeth with Mama
[1:15:32] tried to one time brush my teeth with
[1:15:33] the soap ivory is not good when you
[1:15:36] taste it
[1:15:39] and that really does no good at all that
[1:15:44] just makes her happy
[1:15:47] right but when God watches your mouth
[1:15:51] with the Holy Ghost when God watches
[1:15:54] your mouth with the holy go you will not
[1:15:57] speak another word like he spoke before
[1:15:59] why because he watches you from the
[1:16:02] inside and then we're man bring forth
[1:16:06] children die desire shall be to thy
[1:16:08] husband what another covenant woman
[1:16:12] can't preach woman can't do why because
[1:16:14] she's she's deceivableness of telling
[1:16:21] you what brother said she's thousand
[1:16:22] times more deceived than a man and man I
[1:16:24] know the sisters are not going amend
[1:16:27] that but a man anyway my desire shall be
[1:16:30] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[1:16:32] thee and to the end till Adam he said
[1:16:35] now see he's getting them all because
[1:16:37] remember before that God said who told
[1:16:40] you y'all with nigut adam said that
[1:16:42] woman you gave me
[1:16:45] he said even how did you know that a
[1:16:47] woman how do you know that she said that
[1:16:49] beast you gave me and plural beast he
[1:16:52] couldn't go no further because the
[1:16:54] monkey was going I didn't do anything
[1:16:58] but really a master way when I mean came
[1:17:01] down because remember the property God
[1:17:03] said he said in that animal that fell
[1:17:05] that's why they had to start doing
[1:17:06] animal sacrifices a man called to come
[1:17:09] through the animal animal kingdom and
[1:17:10] that's why in Romans 8 it and then it's
[1:17:13] over strike home it'll bless your heart
[1:17:15] the whole world is groaning why the
[1:17:17] whole world didn't groan when Adam and
[1:17:19] Eve was standing in the garden under the
[1:17:22] rule of the Holy Ghost and God leading
[1:17:24] them there was no problem there was no
[1:17:28] cheetah trying to eat them
[1:17:30] there was no lion that grounded him no
[1:17:33] they what everything was love you said
[1:17:38] they're going to be animals in heaven
[1:17:39] the Bible says the line will lay down
[1:17:41] with the lamb
[1:17:46] why because everything goes right back
[1:17:48] the whole world is groaning that's why
[1:17:51] that animal will attack you now you know
[1:17:54] why because he knows usually when it
[1:17:56] made the fall hello somebody because the
[1:18:04] atom was the highest form of animal and
[1:18:06] man and it had to start from the top
[1:18:09] that's why God didn't come back down
[1:18:12] here an animal he came down here is a
[1:18:14] man a man started it too high and into
[1:18:18] Adam he said because thou has hearkened
[1:18:20] to the voice of my wife and have eaten
[1:18:24] of the tree not a piece of fruit in
[1:18:27] other words / took of her what she gave
[1:18:29] him of which I commanded thee saying
[1:18:32] thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the
[1:18:35] ground a look he couldn't curse the son
[1:18:37] of God he cursed the ground in sorrow
[1:18:44] shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
[1:18:46] life I like what brother Joel said
[1:18:49] that's why God could not accept Cain's
[1:18:51] sacrifice Cain's sacrifice came from the
[1:18:55] cursed earth root and then we'll get
[1:19:00] into that I'm trying to get I'm trying
[1:19:01] to get it able and came out of the womb
[1:19:04] and I won't get it today we'll get it
[1:19:12] next time
[1:19:13] brother Andy don't come next week you're
[1:19:15] gonna try to come next week no okay
[1:19:18] don't we have a little vacation from us
[1:19:20] but I guess not all right let's look
[1:19:23] number three so then so the fall
[1:19:25] happened just to make a long story short
[1:19:28] what did God do God cast him out of the
[1:19:30] Garden of Eden right come in he actually
[1:19:34] killed the lamb pulled the skins off the
[1:19:38] lamb throw them back into the bushes and
[1:19:40] said here put this on because they knew
[1:19:42] they were naked then and he sent them
[1:19:43] out of the garden right this is what
[1:19:47] we're going to try to get to it's right
[1:19:48] here seven church ages in seven seals
[1:19:51] this is back in
[1:19:56] back in 1963 the breach alright here we
[1:20:02] go
[1:20:02] thank you now you rolled it down suckers
[1:20:03] hit after I fumbled for it for ten
[1:20:05] seconds now we don't need anybody to
[1:20:08] interpret that for us see for of course
[1:20:10] we know it was eternal life they had
[1:20:12] fallen from and they lost their claims
[1:20:15] on eternal life by the fall of Adam and
[1:20:17] Eve who fell from eternal life to death
[1:20:20] in the Garden of Eden and brought all
[1:20:23] nature under them to death all right a
[1:20:26] tree never died before Adam an animal
[1:20:29] wouldn't die before Adam there's only
[1:20:31] one thing that cannot die and that's
[1:20:33] good because he's eternal and that's the
[1:20:36] only way we can ever keep from dying we
[1:20:39] have to have eternal life in us so so
[1:20:41] it's then up here got brother Brad was
[1:20:44] not talking about their soul they didn't
[1:20:47] follow me colonel live from the Sheol
[1:20:49] Adam was the son of God he was the
[1:20:51] daughter of God goes right here it says
[1:20:53] the same thing we have to have eternal
[1:20:55] life in us to be sons of doors to go but
[1:20:58] now remember the flesh still died the
[1:21:00] flesh you're still dying and then
[1:21:02] because what did Adam lose but when we
[1:21:04] died as I said in the message this
[1:21:06] morning to sin we sold out our
[1:21:08] birthright and cross this chasm that was
[1:21:11] at enmity of that division that we can't
[1:21:13] get back listen God told Adam I believe
[1:21:16] this is I'm interpolating here God said
[1:21:18] Adam I cannot talk to you face to face
[1:21:20] anymore because of this horribleness of
[1:21:23] sin I can't come down to property guard
[1:21:26] said God will come down in the cool and
[1:21:27] talk to Adam and Eve face to face before
[1:21:31] the fall I'm talking like communion face
[1:21:34] to face and say that's my children but
[1:21:38] after the fall guard said now I'm going
[1:21:40] to put in with you I got to put a
[1:21:41] division between me because I can't
[1:21:43] stand fit there's got to be a blood
[1:21:45] covering there's got to be something in
[1:21:48] between me and you now because we can't
[1:21:51] talk like we used to could talk you have
[1:21:53] separated yourself and you cannot get
[1:21:56] back and step one way because remember
[1:22:00] Adam was the ruler of the earth
[1:22:04] but he could not die or give his life to
[1:22:09] go into Eve man that's what we're going
[1:22:14] to read it here in just a minute all
[1:22:15] these people that said that that Adam
[1:22:18] placing his natural seed in Eve I'll
[1:22:20] just read it right here brother Epson
[1:22:21] revelations chapter 1 he says Adam seed
[1:22:25] lost everything
[1:22:27] Adams natural seed listen if I don't
[1:22:30] natural Steve save it Steve Sade saved
[1:22:33] Eve why did they need a sacrifice why
[1:22:36] did they
[1:22:37] why did Abel's sacrifice why was it
[1:22:40] accepted if it was it listen the natural
[1:22:46] seeds what Cass
[1:22:47] hey come on people did great it sounds
[1:22:51] good it may feel good but in that what
[1:22:54] Satan talk to Eve to make her feel good
[1:22:57] it wasn't right one word off but he
[1:23:01] tried to get Eve to feel good about
[1:23:02] herself
[1:23:03] come on Eve me and you go help God and
[1:23:06] Eve you know instead was to see I got a
[1:23:08] man from God's will read in a minute I
[1:23:10] got a man from God how deceiving is that
[1:23:15] what a deception all right now let's
[1:23:19] finish reading this we sold out our
[1:23:20] birthright and cross the chasm
[1:23:22] now we're beyond the reach of God pull
[1:23:25] it back up on this other side of the
[1:23:29] chasm see we're beyond the reach of God
[1:23:32] in other words we can't take what we
[1:23:35] have and go straight in the presence of
[1:23:37] God with it we've got to have that blood
[1:23:40] covering brother Branham even said
[1:23:42] listen brother Branson even a Christian
[1:23:44] God only what hears your voice because
[1:23:46] if he come down through here not to kill
[1:23:48] you why because this is not so why you
[1:23:53] got to go to the ground if we can't get
[1:23:54] it if we can't get it if we can't get it
[1:23:57] it's got to go to the ground and man
[1:24:02] well the scripture says we plant them in
[1:24:04] corruption plant that means you put them
[1:24:06] six foot under you plant them in the
[1:24:08] ground in corruption and raise them in
[1:24:11] and corruption
[1:24:14] now of course when Adam fell to death he
[1:24:17] brought death upon all creation now he
[1:24:20] was given free moral agency it was given
[1:24:23] them just as week in other words just as
[1:24:26] we are to make a choice you can't say
[1:24:28] well I outside on the folder portal II
[1:24:30] bless your heart down with her fault no
[1:24:32] you got choice you're standing here just
[1:24:36] like Adam and Eve but we know one thing
[1:24:43] for sure that chasm has been brought
[1:24:46] back together having an earth has kissed
[1:24:49] a man now let's read them
[1:24:53] we sold our birthright now we were
[1:24:55] talking about a title deed it was what
[1:24:57] we were going to try to get to and it's
[1:24:59] almost 3:30 we may go just a little bit
[1:25:01] longer today but we need to get this
[1:25:04] book part out here okay let's go to
[1:25:07] number 4 revelation now notice what did
[1:25:11] we lose well it was given to Adam to
[1:25:15] have eternal life as long as he eat from
[1:25:18] the tree he had eternal life okay long
[1:25:21] is heat from the tree he had eternal
[1:25:23] life and we notice again that Adam was
[1:25:26] the he inherit the earth
[1:25:29] Adams inheritance was what the earth
[1:25:31] alright and as long as he stayed where
[1:25:34] he was supposed to be everything was
[1:25:36] alright okay and we noticed again the
[1:25:39] Adam was the inherit the earth he was
[1:25:41] like an amateur God over the earth the
[1:25:43] earth was his hey man
[1:25:48] God said here you can't carry an earth
[1:25:51] I'll take care heaven alright the earth
[1:25:55] was his everything was given no like an
[1:25:58] amateur God the earth was his everything
[1:25:59] was given unto his hand he could do with
[1:26:03] it whatever he wanted to he named it and
[1:26:06] called it and done whatever he wanted to
[1:26:08] he was truly a son of God now in the
[1:26:11] fall Adam forfeit the title deed to that
[1:26:16] okay he forfeit to Satan Satan took the
[1:26:22] title deed now remember we're going to
[1:26:24] read this a little bit further where
[1:26:25] brother Branham comes back and says
[1:26:27] Satan
[1:26:28] as I have the title deed the title deed
[1:26:29] goes back to the original owner Satan is
[1:26:32] just a squatter that all right listen
[1:26:35] Satan is not a squatter on the earth
[1:26:37] Satan just quarter right here this is
[1:26:39] the only earth I'm concerned about this
[1:26:41] big ball of Earth God said is going to
[1:26:42] be here and this it's going to be
[1:26:44] eternal and it's going to have a city
[1:26:46] setting on it and eternal people's going
[1:26:47] to live and be living on it but until
[1:26:50] that happens this earth right here is
[1:26:51] what I'm worried about
[1:26:52] hey ma'am all right Satan took the title
[1:26:55] deed Adam was very slothful and he did
[1:26:59] not redeem his right for he could not
[1:27:01] redeem his right why he crossed over a
[1:27:06] man I like what somebody said you know
[1:27:09] Satan
[1:27:10] Satan's sole purpose was to stop a son
[1:27:13] of God from being born and he did
[1:27:17] because when he polluted the wound with
[1:27:19] Eve doc said I can't do that no more
[1:27:21] I can't go this I can't go that way I'm
[1:27:24] not going that way that's not the way I
[1:27:26] want to go but he only potentially
[1:27:31] stopped a son of God because look what
[1:27:36] happened God came himself because he's
[1:27:40] the only one that can impart his life
[1:27:42] back into somebody that's sinful hey man
[1:27:44] Eve can Tim put me Adam couldn't impart
[1:27:47] his life back into Eve he thought he
[1:27:54] could he thought he could brother I'm
[1:27:56] said he went out to get her and found
[1:27:58] out when he got out that with her he's
[1:28:00] like what I do now what I do now that's
[1:28:07] why God said hold on a minute
[1:28:09] I'll make away you put these bloody
[1:28:12] skins on you go out there and you work
[1:28:14] arrestor your life and you do what you
[1:28:16] need to do Satan is going to eat your
[1:28:18] dust but I'm going to come as the seed
[1:28:20] of the woman and I'm going to put this
[1:28:22] whole thing right back together again
[1:28:24] hey man clothes remember I want you to
[1:28:28] look at something see if I'm right
[1:28:32] because I thought about this last night
[1:28:35] that title deed
[1:28:38] we say and I want to try to work this
[1:28:42] right because remember Adams sole
[1:28:47] purpose on the earth wake up and listen
[1:28:51] Adam sole purpose on this earth was to
[1:28:54] reproduce Jesus Christ or to bring Jesus
[1:28:57] Christ to reproduce God's children right
[1:28:59] brother branham said Jesus's body when
[1:29:03] it comes to what to eat the woman Eve
[1:29:05] that all right we okay with that so the
[1:29:09] whole plan is right there so that title
[1:29:11] deed is not every name it became a book
[1:29:18] of redemption but before the fall it was
[1:29:22] not a but listen the Genesis 1:26 men
[1:29:25] never needed redemption that's what
[1:29:29] struck me last night that title deed was
[1:29:34] after the fall and it became a book of
[1:29:37] redemption because you go over to
[1:29:39] revelations 5 and you had to have one
[1:29:42] take the book out of the hand of the
[1:29:44] original owner the original owner was
[1:29:46] gone he had the original Genesis 1:26
[1:29:50] the soul of God that never fell but he
[1:29:55] became a book of redemption when we fell
[1:29:58] when Jesus took that book he took a book
[1:30:01] I'll be redeemed don't ever tell me you
[1:30:08] don't need redemptions I'm gonna tell
[1:30:09] you something that one inside of you
[1:30:10] does not need redeeming that's right if
[1:30:14] you're born again thank you
[1:30:15] if you're born again that inside of you
[1:30:17] never needs Redemption the rest of you
[1:30:21] does because I was looking for a quote
[1:30:24] and I couldn't find it last night I'll
[1:30:25] try to find it we're brother Branham
[1:30:28] said Adam when all this happened his
[1:30:31] whole nature was clouded everything was
[1:30:35] clouded - what he what he knew and
[1:30:36] everything behind him was clouded never
[1:30:38] and that's the same way with you and I
[1:30:39] when we're born in this world there's a
[1:30:41] nature attached to us and it's a fallen
[1:30:44] nature it is not the nature of God we
[1:30:47] come by permissive well which is not
[1:30:49] what the full will of God
[1:30:52] and man we come by permissive will but
[1:30:54] guess what now that we're in permissive
[1:30:56] well all we got to look is that Genesis
[1:30:58] 1:26 man is brother Dale was telling us
[1:31:00] this morning
[1:31:01] adenosine 1:26 man called my name call
[1:31:05] my name I want these heard a word of God
[1:31:08] call my name I responded because like
[1:31:12] brother Bob was talking about this
[1:31:13] morning
[1:31:13] my name was already there you can't
[1:31:19] respond to something
[1:31:20] if you never were it like I'm you know
[1:31:23] I'm going to Albuquerque New Mexico I've
[1:31:25] never been out cooking my life but I
[1:31:26] can't say I've been there but now when I
[1:31:28] come back I'd say I've been there
[1:31:30] hey man we are wait a minute I read
[1:31:36] treatment oh it's proper to go to poor
[1:31:42] man okay go keep reading it is the god
[1:31:49] of the earth the Bible says so he
[1:31:50] possesses that not because that he
[1:31:52] really rightfully gets it but he possess
[1:31:55] it am I saying Satan is just down here
[1:31:57] just a squatter that title deed what
[1:31:59] happened if you wanted to look it if you
[1:32:01] want to look at it this way in an
[1:32:03] illustration this is Genesis 1:26 okay
[1:32:08] alright this is look at this in Genesis
[1:32:10] 1:26 it was given to Adam to produce all
[1:32:14] the names right of the redeemed of the
[1:32:19] of the born again alright now what
[1:32:23] happened Adam couldn't do that anymore
[1:32:27] its way of producing it had been what
[1:32:32] and God just didn't seal it he put seven
[1:32:35] bands around it because remember that
[1:32:38] book of redemption has access to seal
[1:32:40] book that book was sealed
[1:32:43] he opened the book God sealed it back up
[1:32:46] and Adam had to hand it back to God and
[1:32:51] God said that's okay you couldn't do it
[1:32:53] anyway because you can't get into the
[1:32:56] believers like I can but I'm going hold
[1:33:00] on to this until I come on earth and a
[1:33:03] baby called Jesus
[1:33:06] and I'm gonna bring out Genesis 1:26
[1:33:09] wrapped up in swaddling clothes hey man
[1:33:13] the first item came what not born again
[1:33:18] in this spirit I mean it's yeah in his
[1:33:20] body but he had the soul of Almighty God
[1:33:24] and man but when Jesus comes back he's
[1:33:27] the whole ego he's what he's the soul of
[1:33:30] God and man put in a flesh body that
[1:33:33] what came from God and man takes that
[1:33:37] Genesis 1:26 and he walks on the earth
[1:33:39] and parable of the sower of the seed
[1:33:45] parable to sow the seed who is the sole
[1:33:47] son of man is the sword the seed you
[1:33:52] listen to what Jeremiah said you listen
[1:33:55] to what Isaiah said now you listen to
[1:33:57] what I said now you get over here in
[1:34:00] acts and you listen to what my people
[1:34:01] said you get over here you listen to
[1:34:03] what brother Dale said you get over here
[1:34:06] you listen to what brother Aaron said
[1:34:08] you get over here and you listen to what
[1:34:09] this brother said that's the truth
[1:34:11] hey man that's the way it was supposed
[1:34:13] to come so the Genesis 1:26 man is alive
[1:34:18] and well today it looked bad back in the
[1:34:21] garden but it doesn't look bad today why
[1:34:25] because we fell and Lords to be redeemed
[1:34:29] if I was if I never but drowning in sin
[1:34:34] and drowning in shame and grounding in
[1:34:36] the water and God reaches and gets me
[1:34:38] and pulls me up and puts me in the boat
[1:34:40] and says you don't have to drown anymore
[1:34:43] and stupid don't jump back in the water
[1:34:45] I have saved you it's like we're there
[1:34:50] with some of this morning as well it's
[1:34:51] think about so sometimes God will he'll
[1:34:54] forgive you yourself put you in the
[1:34:57] lifeboat and our stupidity and humanity
[1:35:00] we just take a double dial backwards and
[1:35:02] go back in the water again hey man can I
[1:35:05] ask that guy one time he said I'm saved

[1:35:45] look you ever drowning in the muck of
[1:35:47] sin I'll promise you one thing when God
[1:35:49] pulls you out and you realize that you
[1:35:51] don't want to go back there again hey
[1:35:53] man you hear from your theophany you
[1:35:55] hear from that Genesis 1:26 man and
[1:35:57] there's the pull and man there's to pull
[1:36:00] that pulls us into God again because
[1:36:03] what we were separated and then all
[1:36:06] right now look let's continue reading
[1:36:08] here just real quick real quick we're
[1:36:11] going to get we're going to get Cain and
[1:36:13] Abel out of the womb here and just real
[1:36:14] quick but the title deed Adam had the
[1:36:17] title deed Adam had full control and he
[1:36:20] lost it by what by listening to Eve and
[1:36:24] walking wilfully out but come on people
[1:36:27] first Timothy 2:14 says Adam was not
[1:36:30] deceived but Eve was deceived an item
[1:36:33] walked out brother I'm said with both
[1:36:35] eyes open but he was but see he got out
[1:36:39] there and realized he couldn't help Eve
[1:36:42] they never could go back to that
[1:36:44] condition because what he didn't have
[1:36:46] the ability to take his spirit and put
[1:36:50] it into something else man he wasn't a
[1:36:54] savior listen Adam with a son of God but
[1:36:56] he wasn't the savior of the world man
[1:36:58] there's only one person that's a savior
[1:37:00] and that's the one that created you a
[1:37:01] man but he forfeited let's go all the
[1:37:05] way up scroll it up down or whichever
[1:37:08] I'm like lady with there will you look
[1:37:14] right there
[1:37:16] but he's forfeit to Adam forfeiture Kyle
[1:37:19] deed to it to this all this stuff that
[1:37:21] we own eternal life and the inheriting
[1:37:23] of the earth Jesus said in Matthew 5
[1:37:25] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:37:28] inherit the earth
[1:37:29] done alright
[1:37:36] now we don't have it now hmm and look it
[1:37:44] wasn't to Adam or any of his seeds Oh
[1:37:48] Adam Adam seed absolutely lost
[1:37:52] everything - it's not the seed of Adam
[1:37:57] so there's no natural seed going to save
[1:37:59] us that's the perversion part of it no
[1:38:01] matter how much we try to beautify this
[1:38:04] world and how much we try to make big
[1:38:06] fine homes and things that still doesn't
[1:38:07] belong to Adam seeds no sir it did not
[1:38:11] go to Adam see because Satan took it
[1:38:14] lock stock and barrel right for Adam
[1:38:18] forfeited it hey man keep going number
[1:38:21] five this is still revelation chapter
[1:38:26] five number two now our kinsman has
[1:38:28] handed the seven sealed book of
[1:38:29] redemption from the original owner of
[1:38:31] the original owner when we lost it now
[1:38:33] look he doesn't say when Adam lost it
[1:38:36] when we lost it at the Garden of Eden
[1:38:39] through Adam it went back to the
[1:38:42] original owner but there's been a poster
[1:38:45] on the land a squadron that Satan he
[1:38:48] come over and he's a poacher this earth
[1:38:50] don't belong to him belongs to God but

[1:39:05] seals now watch this he breaks the seals
[1:39:07] reveals gives us his inheritor gives us
[1:39:11] his inheritance to his people now
[1:39:16] remember the proper guard said he said
[1:39:18] Jesus did not come in to bring you an
[1:39:19] inheritance your inheritance was before
[1:39:24] the foundation world he came back to get
[1:39:27] you away back to it I am the way the
[1:39:29] truth and the life I'm the door all
[1:39:31] right

[1:39:34] inherited what did he inherit he inherit
[1:39:38] eternal life in his body inherit eternal
[1:39:42] life in the soul listen if you're born
[1:39:44] again you already got your inheritance
[1:39:48] we're just waiting to realize that that
[1:39:51] inheritance for our bodies already been
[1:39:53] paid become kinsman redeemer and freely
[1:39:56] gives it out to us it all belong to him
[1:39:59] he was the one who redeemed but instead
[1:40:02] of keeping it to himself he gives it
[1:40:05] back to the people that his love for you

[1:40:28] all right let's read number six the
[1:40:31] Easter seal 1965 look God had had the
[1:40:35] same when he saw Jesus it was the
[1:40:37] finished work that God finished with
[1:40:39] Jesus when he said it's finished all the
[1:40:41] plan was finished and when the Spirit of
[1:40:45] God comes upon you and you truly are one
[1:40:47] of God's attributes that's at Genesis
[1:40:49] 1:26 men that he's spoken of now if
[1:40:52] you're not you'll wonder and frustrate
[1:40:55] and run here and there and everywhere
[1:40:57] else and never come to the knowledge of
[1:40:58] the truth if you are one of those the
[1:41:02] old things pass away right quickly see
[1:41:05] and you become new scrolled on up and
[1:41:08] you become new and the plan of salvation
[1:41:11] is finished you're ready to obey every
[1:41:15] word that God ever spoke of you see for
[1:41:17] you to do you're submissive to his word
[1:41:20] the contract exactly the abstract to the
[1:41:23] contract the title deed belongs to Oh
[1:41:31] belongs to whom I thought he said God
[1:41:34] had it but when God came down here and
[1:41:37] died went back across another dimension
[1:41:42] come back on the day of Pentecost it all
[1:41:45] struck off as it was at the day of
[1:41:49] Pentecost hey man where did the book go
[1:41:54] the book disappeared in Genesis
[1:41:59] all down to this all down through the
[1:42:02] Old Testament what blood of bulls and
[1:42:05] goats pushing our covering brother
[1:42:09] Harris head a capo that cut that cut it
[1:42:11] just it kicked over us and it followed
[1:42:14] through the Old Testament amen
[1:42:17] there was never a son of God in an Old
[1:42:20] Testament no no Adam was the son of God
[1:42:25] in the Old Testament he was the first
[1:42:27] item the first he fell
[1:42:30] the first item fell a man so now we come
[1:42:34] down to the second Adam he's standing in
[1:42:36] the same place he said get behind me
[1:42:39] Satan it is written use the Word of God
[1:42:43] it is written and then and he walks
[1:42:47] through the earth and he takes and says
[1:42:49] blessed are the meek blessed of the poor
[1:42:56] what so in what so in the seed word so
[1:43:00] that you and I could come run others
[1:43:01] book and we'll know one thing's for sure
[1:43:07] when our bodies changed we are truly
[1:43:10] fully redeemed and then the redemption
[1:43:14] story listen I like that song the Angels
[1:43:18] all will listen fine why they never fail
[1:43:22] for they cannot join that song when the
[1:43:27] redeemed are gathering in and then when
[1:43:32] the redeemed are gathering in alright
[1:43:35] let's go one more let's go to the very
[1:43:37] end here but God Almighty then listen
[1:43:41] this is his plan you can accept it or
[1:43:45] reject it this is it this is the way it
[1:43:48] happened you were born in sin from your
[1:43:54] mom and daddy or who had doesn't matter
[1:43:56] you got here God gave you a life come
[1:44:02] Satan can't give you a life but what
[1:44:04] does Satan do Satan attacks in nature to
[1:44:06] that life
[1:44:07] older dammit nature that old nature
[1:44:09] that's what reverts us back to
[1:44:12] the devil amen Roberta just back to the
[1:44:16] devil hey man
[1:44:18] and then God has to what come down and
[1:44:21] burn off get rid of that get rid of that
[1:44:24] old nature so that what you can hear the
[1:44:28] prophet of God you hear from that
[1:44:29] theophany how did you hear from at the
[1:44:32] opening somebody had to preach it to you
[1:44:33] you all I was sitting listen but what
[1:44:37] were you thinking about what were you
[1:44:41] thinking what some preacher had said the
[1:44:44] night before six months ago
[1:44:45] what brother branham you put you press
[1:44:47] the play button are you how to preacher
[1:44:50] come by and preach and you had to
[1:44:51] meditate on that and then God called
[1:44:54] your name and you heard from that that
[1:44:58] was already there listen brother brother
[1:45:02] branham ID reading it to that this
[1:45:04] morning you know everybody
[1:45:06] god forbid all the denomination you know
[1:45:09] that you know your names written on the
[1:45:11] book when you receive okay and I didn't
[1:45:14] know that was so much daddy was in the
[1:45:16] Baptist Church but I heard a Baptist
[1:45:17] woman tell me one time she said if that
[1:45:19] preacher don't do what I say I'm taking
[1:45:21] my letter and going somewhere else like
[1:45:24] that was really going that letter meant
[1:45:28] so much to them coach one yet names
[1:45:29] written on that letter your names
[1:45:31] written in heaven no let me tell you
[1:45:32] something your name was either written
[1:45:34] in the book before the foundation of the
[1:45:35] world all right we'll never be written
[1:45:38] in that hey man all right now after the
[1:45:43] fall let's go to Genesis 4 and we'll
[1:45:45] stop right here we're going to reach
[1:45:47] this and then we'll quit everybody all
[1:45:49] right and then it's a wonderful plan
[1:45:54] listen it's a perfect plan because God
[1:45:55] did it it's not a this is not a man plan
[1:45:59] this is a God Almighty plan that works
[1:46:03] every time never does fail if it failed
[1:46:07] this because you fail and Adam knew Eve
[1:46:11] his wife and she conceived and bare Cain
[1:46:15] and said I have gotten a man from the
[1:46:17] Lord knowing that she had had relations
[1:46:19] will that be and she again bare his
[1:46:22] brother Abel so they were twins
[1:46:25] amen they were twins you see how can
[1:46:28] that happen it's happened many times
[1:46:30] before the wound doesn't close up until
[1:46:34] like 24 hours later once you sew there
[1:46:36] was a conception not long ago in in
[1:46:38] California where a woman had relations
[1:46:41] with a black man in the morning and had
[1:46:42] relations with her husband in the
[1:46:44] afternoon and guess what they had twins
[1:46:45] the woman was white and one was black
[1:46:46] right so that's documented that proves
[1:46:49] what God says a man that proves what
[1:46:52] happened in the garden right because
[1:46:54] brother Brown said to Eve even the Beast
[1:46:56] in the morning even at him in the
[1:46:57] afternoon I'm even told when he was you
[1:47:00] reckon he might have went back in the
[1:47:01] vision and anyway if Moses could I know
[1:47:05] the prophethood and she again bare his
[1:47:08] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[1:47:11] the sheep but came with the tiller of
[1:47:12] the ground now look before them remember
[1:47:15] they didn't know good and evil the only
[1:47:18] new good that all right because remember
[1:47:21] Satan tells Eve said if you'll if you'll
[1:47:23] partake of this you'll be like God
[1:47:25] you'll know good and evil so the two
[1:47:30] spirits come right down and works into
[1:47:32] these two guys and what we're going to
[1:47:34] do next Sunday is we're going to show
[1:47:36] and bring in and see how that those two
[1:47:39] spirits work but we're just going to
[1:47:42] read this and then quit because it's
[1:47:43] almost 4:00 and she again bare his
[1:47:45] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[1:47:47] the sheep but Cain with the tiller of
[1:47:49] the ground so Cain was wiped from the
[1:47:51] seat of the Beast Abel's from the seed
[1:47:53] of Adam okay all right all right that's
[1:47:56] what we just been explaining the whole
[1:47:58] time all right and in in process of time
[1:48:01] it came to pass that Cain brought of the
[1:48:04] fruit of the ground and offered it unto
[1:48:06] the Lord now look at that that's capital
[1:48:08] L cap sold teller he brought it straight
[1:48:09] to God and then he laid it right before
[1:48:13] God and Abel he also brought of the
[1:48:16] firstlings of his flock firstling that
[1:48:19] means there was some more of his flock
[1:48:21] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[1:48:24] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:29] but unto Cain and his offering he had
[1:48:32] not respect and Cain was very wroth now
[1:48:36] look look at the ad
[1:48:39] that cane had and his countenance fell
[1:48:43] because remember let's be real honest
[1:48:45] Cain didn't have a daddy that was live
[1:48:50] Bob Kane's daddy is now crawling on
[1:48:54] ground
[1:48:55] hey man so Adam had to be both of them
[1:48:59] daddy and he wasn't Cain's father that
[1:49:03] all right that's the way it happened but
[1:49:06] Cain and to his offering he had not
[1:49:08] respect and Cain was very wroth and his
[1:49:10] countenance fell in other words he had a
[1:49:12] chip on his shoulder and the Lord said
[1:49:14] unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is
[1:49:17] thy countenance fallen if thou do us
[1:49:20] well if thou doest well shalt thou not
[1:49:25] be accepted and if thou dust not well
[1:49:30] sin lies at the door and into thee shall
[1:49:33] be his desire and thou shalt rule over
[1:49:37] him he's given Cain an opportunity to do
[1:49:40] what Abel did but you see them two
[1:49:43] spirits have to come down and they have
[1:49:45] to be close but one has to reject them
[1:49:48] one has to accept a man one has to
[1:49:50] accept and one has to reject same thing
[1:49:52] with right now now let's read James 1
[1:49:55] verse 14 and we'll start there next
[1:49:57] Sunday James 1:14 says but every man is
[1:50:01] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:50:03] lust and enticed
[1:50:04] then when the lust has conceived it
[1:50:07] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[1:50:11] finished bringeth forth death
[1:50:14] you got lust conception sin and death
[1:50:21] you see how it happens when lust is
[1:50:24] conceived it brings forth sin when sin
[1:50:26] is finished it brings forth death he
[1:50:29] said brother what are you talking about
[1:50:30] we were brought here in lust we were
[1:50:34] conceived in sin and man but we can stop
[1:50:38] this thing right here because when it's
[1:50:41] finished it brings forth death and your
[1:50:43] soul today if you don't have the new
[1:50:45] birth you can stop that death process
[1:50:47] you can stop it today now we still get
[1:50:51] older
[1:50:52] those two spirits are still going to
[1:50:54] work we're going to talk about next
[1:50:55] Sunday where the two you'll look at the
[1:50:57] two spirits and Abel and Cain and read a
[1:50:59] little bit further but let's stand to
[1:51:00] our feet musicians come but every man is
[1:51:04] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:51:06] lust and enticed so listening we're all
[1:51:09] tempted right some of you are both
[1:51:15] better than others I guess we're tempted
[1:51:19] every single day of our life but there's
[1:51:24] something that holds me not not anything
[1:51:29] I've done but I have to like both elf is
[1:51:34] what I have to believe I have to believe
[1:51:38] to be able to receive the blessings that
[1:51:41] God has for us it was a horrible thing
[1:51:44] that happen in the Garden of Eden
[1:51:45] horrible cause never sinned death
[1:51:47] anguish every bad thought everything
[1:51:50] it's you every time you have a problem
[1:51:51] think back to the garden so that's where
[1:51:54] it happened but now there was a reversal
[1:51:56] of lack when the second Adam came and
[1:51:59] he's brother Brian told us he said God's
[1:52:01] going to prove the Satan that the second
[1:52:03] Eve which is what I'm looking at today
[1:52:06] will not fall she will not fall for that
[1:52:11] one word off and then so how can you say
[1:52:18] we're failure if the second even the
[1:52:21] prophets are in spoke because the second
[1:52:23] Eve will not fall will not fall come
[1:52:27] what may put us in the ground for what
[1:52:30] will come up first a man will be changed
[1:52:34] before the lot of people are a man but
[1:52:38] you believe that what God has done for
[1:52:39] you he started before the foundation of
[1:52:42] the world slaying the lamb before the
[1:52:45] foundation of the world put your name on
[1:52:46] the book before the foundation of the
[1:52:48] world signed sealed and delivered it was
[1:52:51] all you got to do is it's just accepted
[1:52:53] just say I see my name in that block
[1:53:00] name goes on the book before the
[1:53:04] foundation of the world now we know
[1:53:05] there's different sections
[1:53:06] the book and it goes on one side as a
[1:53:08] believer sure that's brother brain was
[1:53:10] trying to tell us a story man
[1:53:13] because Judas his name was put on the
[1:53:14] book but Judas his name was not put on
[1:53:16] the book before the foundation of the
[1:53:17] world as an eternal person no it was
[1:53:21] written in the book of life the book of
[1:53:24] life is everybody's name and then he was
[1:53:27] stricken off because of what his choice
[1:53:30] his choice struck his name off that book
[1:53:34] but see God knew that before the
[1:53:36] foundation of the world brother brown
[1:53:39] said hold that word redemption that word
[1:53:42] Redemption I'm telling you that's why
[1:53:45] the sons of God shouted for joy they saw
[1:53:47] the plan of redemption
[1:53:49] we now clearly from the beginning of
[1:53:52] time before the beginning of time like a
[1:53:54] prophet of God said before the eternal
[1:53:56] we see where we come from what we're
[1:53:59] doing here and where we're going and
[1:54:01] then because Redemption is not
[1:54:03] replacement brother ray we know that
[1:54:05] redemption is taking what fell picking
[1:54:07] it back up and putting it back into
[1:54:09] position it's supposed to be it you and
[1:54:11] I have a position to rule and reign over
[1:54:14] this earth that's our position not to
[1:54:17] rule and reign like people rule and
[1:54:19] reign now no that's not right the Bible
[1:54:23] says the meek shall inherit the earth
[1:54:24] I've never seen many meek kings and
[1:54:27] rulers and no look in the television
[1:54:30] you'll see they're not very meek people
[1:54:32] they want to destroy you or they want to
[1:54:34] do something no the meek shall inherit
[1:54:36] the earth God has given us this earth
[1:54:38] but he's working on this earth first and
[1:54:41] man he's working on this earth he's
[1:54:44] still working on me why to get this man
[1:54:46] what just moved me over and put me where
[1:54:51] I'm supposed to be you got but how you
[1:54:53] can't stand right here you got to do the
[1:54:57] same thing you gotta say I'm standing
[1:54:58] here this is my position and man realize
[1:55:04] that realize your position what you're
[1:55:07] doing here what is your what is your
[1:55:09] purpose because remember here we go
[1:55:12] again God's plans eternal he saw your
[1:55:15] purpose before you got here he knew what
[1:55:18] you do when you got here he knew
[1:55:20] what you do with it when you got here
[1:55:22] let's just fulfill the purpose the plan
[1:55:26] and purpose of God let's sing a song you
