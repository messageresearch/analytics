luke the 24th chapter luke the 24th chapter remember now the announcements that the bible study will be the first saturday in august and also that weekend brother quinn will be with us for the uh reaching for the weekend on 7th for us so just remember these announcements and all the other things that are said uh sister rebecca ran me off i got him to run off the thing showing what august meant and i had looked it up in part but i didn't get it like this one but uh you know i'm saying this morning brother and said the august presence we'll see august means uh inspiring all or admiration or majestic you know so that was an august presence of majestic it also has to do with uh dignifying about a a rank of a of a person you know in the uh iraq and things because it's called an august lineage in a high rank so then you know and brother around was saying the august president the all these you know the majestic presence of the lord but also he's a very high rank too that would appreciate it i mean so remember that bible study first saturday for the quinn will be with us august the 7th so let's pray luke 24 heavenly father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have thank you for thy word and we pray that you would just help us to understand and to lord to walk in the light of your love we know for a surety that within us that is within our being on ourselves we are worthy of nothing and how no thoughts or whatsoever to be that we could be anything other than what you make us and we thank you because that way we can just depend totally upon you and whatever you say we can believe it we love you and we thank you bless each one bless the sick let's reach down and touch our wife lord deliver from this hurting inner side and back and all lord and just let everything be well we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen and we'll be reading quite a few verses but from luke 24 we'll start reading at verse 25. now this is uh when uh cleopas and the other one was going from after the rumor of the resurrection and the things that happened and they were on their road to emmaus and jesus steps out with them because they were real sad and he begins to talk to him and ask him what was going on and then so we'll start reading about verse 25 because they said you know that certain of them had seen him and all like that and they were wondering verse 25 then said he unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken oh not christ have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded which means to explain or to interpret you know to expound something is to do that all right and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures are things concerning himself now still they sit and see and see and they they drew nine to the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into terry with them and it came to pass that he said it meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight now get the point there they knew it they knew it was because what he'd done we'll read the minute who's known in the breaking of the bread so you know that's what it says here that happened he he took the bread and break it and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us along the way and while he opened to us the scriptures look at it and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to sign see they wouldn't believe it they're saying well he appeared to simon simon says he did now we know he did because we sing him all right they got something to say about it right right and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread and they thus as they thus fake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and uprighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do you why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bone as you you see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed and showed them his hands and his feet so he still had the nail print started right and while they were yet while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you hear any meat in other words get down a little plainly let's let let me show you something you know they gave him a piece of boiled fish and a honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures he said unto them now here's his opening to him thus it is written and does it before who christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and your witness of these witnesses of these things you may be seated the lord is blessing to the reading of the word now i spoke here just the other week a little bit about this but i want you to you know pay close attention because according to verse 32 he opened the understanding of the two on the road to emmaus and concerning himself all right and then according to verse 45 there he opened the understanding of the the disciples in the you know as they were gathered and everything he opened their understanding of the scriptures all right concerning himself and what he was going to do all right now he didn't open the understanding of all things he opened the understanding of what they needed at the time okay which was to tie with the resurrection and how that what it would be and how that who he would be and how he would have to die and all that he didn't open the whole bible to him because that wouldn't be the way that you're looking at it he opened their understanding of the scriptures concerning himself as to what was there and what was taking place and and all you know and had taken place among them and then he turns around and he says now you're witnesses of these things so they could only be witnesses of the things they had experienced right like i was saying they they you know they they come running back and as they were getting back it's kind of the story would be you'd look at it like when they get back maybe they don't run in immediately and tell what's going on because everybody is so excited and going on and talking about that the resurrection had transpired and and there peter was you know expounding upon it and and telling them that he had seen the lord jesus then they said well let us tell you then they had something personal to do into it of their understanding opened all right now my whole point i made it then and i want to make it now in this as backing up what i said this morning as to the message we were talking about and i want you to think about it this is before the day of pentecost they all right now being before the day of pentecost then see he just opened their understanding of some things all right now uh most everybody thinks and that's you know i'm sorry but i'm just different you you pay attention to most people you think about in the message and they're talking about that the lord opened my understanding and and i'm not saying nothing now i'm just saying it the way i believe that if that's a revelation amen but we can have god to open our understanding of the scriptures all right and that not be the fact that we even have the new birth that's right amen because he done that to the disciples he could open their understanding that they could understand what was going on because we were kind of in a delusion they now back when they were in their uh in their ministry you remember there in matthew that uh jesus well jesus would give a lot of parables right all right and and as he would give a parable to him you know they would sometimes people would catch on to what the parable was and and most of the time they wouldn't right and and then they would ask and even the scripture refers to it that they would ask him privately later you know maybe that night or something you know that later on they would ask him uh what did this parable mean and he would explain it to him all right the parable of the sower the parable of the different things and then one time he said to them he said now it's given unto you that's uh matthew eight nineteen thirteen eleven thirteen eleven i think is thirteen anyhow it's in matthew it was given to the it says given unto you to understand the scriptures right you know the parables right but to these out here that's not given unto them right all right so there must be a a situation in understanding the bible in the correct way that that maybe even because of our own blindness uh we cannot read the bible and get it in the correct understanding now like i said this morning we read it and swore that there was three gods right we we read it and we swore that hell was eternal and and all kind of things and and all of the situations in the bible we we swore by them and said i give you a scripture for them you know well you know that that doesn't necessarily mean it's right you remember one time after uh jesus was talking with some of them and and maybe john was hanging a little close to him and and maybe peter said you know uh something about him or some situation during the scripture and he said what's that to me if he abides till i come well peter you know and i brought around this one it brought this out because we wouldn't have known it because we didn't pay much attention to the bible but peter went around telling the rest of them john ain't going to die you know but john wrote it see and he inserted maybe into his writings to word that they would clarify it real good and he wrote it into his writing and he said how be it he didn't say that john wouldn't die he just said what if it is you know but a saiyan went among the disciples that he wasn't going to die well see he that wasn't what he said all right now i'm wanting to get a point to you see we can have our understanding open and it's opened according to uh uh our uh what would you say uh how much knowledge we have right that's right you know i mean man used to have knowledge years ago that if you travel to a terrific speed of 25 miles an hour that you would just lift up and go off the earth you know well i mean that's what everybody believed because nobody had never been over 25 miles an hour so they couldn't nobody say yeah no that's not right i've been over 25 you know and but see didn't it come a day until it happened right well see according to their knowledge that's what they understood in medical science they used to when you've got certain sicknesses or might basically just basically got sick you know and and down and out they just pull a couple of fingernails out and bleeds you find the blood you know and your your body would reproduce itself and in doing that then it would actually heal the body and you would get well well what do you think about that today i mean how many of you got doctor's appointments tomorrow you're going to go into the doctor and he pulled off a couple of toenails and says let her bleed or reach reaches over and gets a scaffold and just wax a little place and he says let it go i i know this happened that my niece uh you know the rh factor that you have and when they were they waited a few days too late to change the blood and they actually uh if they can catch it real quick back in the old days they could change it through the naval cord and but then after then they would have to do it and i remember they cut my little little niece you know just just all over and let her bleed that blood out as they were putting more blood in that was an old medical way now they got shots to give you that takes care of this that or the other but that's the point of what i'm saying our understanding is according to what we our surroundings are are are what we you know what we're affiliated with right right you know to to understand all right see in doing that then apply that to the bible that the bible was written see but man couldn't even understand the natural writing now when it says in the bible jesus wept see well what is the problem see now we ought to know that that mean he cried right well i don't believe he could cry cause he was god if he was god he couldn't cry and that must mean some other word see and then they said if we could get the original greek you know and all of this that and the other and get everything just right we'd have an understanding of the bible the prophets you remember what he said he said surely they had the greek and the things right back when they there was back there you know when things were said and they couldn't understand right and see even to uh you know understanding like in matthew 21 you know that those pharisees at times they caught on they understood at times their understanding of their head knowledge was open and they realized that jesus was talking about them right right see that he was talking about them they had an understanding whereas when they when one guy heard it you know he goes back to the priest and he says well he's talking about this and he's talking about thorns and he's talking about this what's he talking about this and then the other he said i don't know what i'm really talking about because i'm not a clean you know acquainted with all the parables so he says well i'll just go listen to him he goes and sits down and he listens to him and he comes up with it he said he's talking about me and you yeah you know their understanding was open you understand the point i'm making your understanding can be opened without it being a revelation as i said the other day when i was speaking on this a little the oral roberts university has brother brown's incomplete message will they play it out and those students can read it well you know they can read there's just one god just like you read there's one god they can read that hell is not eternal right and they can read all of the things it lays it out and brother branham you know saying when i go check this out get the greek words get this and they go into the big professor and they say professor we found something said this william branham don't believe it hail's eternal we don't discuss that part because we've been taught and we know that hell is eternal and we're not going to listen to it so put that part out and eventually they would put the whole message out right but you understand what i'm getting at yes you can have your understanding open i've always said it this is not something you would come in to study in this message you know this statement has always been that i wish that i had revealed in my heart what i have in my head right the prophet's message the bible and things i wish it was revealed and see i said that and i did to one brother one time and he said what do you mean what do you mean i said well i've done that before i got the new bird he said what do you mean speak to him the new birth we're just reading the bible and getting some understanding you know from that but see that's to me that's not the new birth if it is the pharisees had it that's right they surely knew the exact lettering of the scriptures and the things but like i said they even said we know he's talking about us see so you can have your understanding open and that's what my whole point now whole message all right is what could it be that what we uh have is an understanding that's right or is it a revelation now i say and i won't back up from it and i believe you'll agree that you see people go in the message for quite a while they can even quote it so much verbatim until you're amazed that their their ability to to tell you what brother around has said on a topic or a subject or whatever and yet then you see them later just leave the message you know well there's something wrong if that was revelation how could you leave the message right all right and like my wife says about it she said anybody can take brother randall's message and the bible and study it a while and make a a speech that's you know it would amaze anybody you know and like i say that our children our children could tell the theologians about the revelation of one god what because they read it so much see we've read it for what 50 some people here that be going on to 50 years that you've been around this message it's it's surely been somewhere where to have a little knowledge you know what i'm fixing to say and the way to always say it you know people say well be where are they i'm quoting right around you know be aware of them it's got the answer to everything and i always say well beware of them that's been around 40 50 years ain't got an answer for nothing no i mean that's just you know to me that maybe i shouldn't be that blunt about saying things but why not right because the if it's not revelation it's just intellect right right amen and see then having just an intellectual conception about something it's very dangerous because at that position you will think it's the holy spirit that has quickened it to you now let's go back what we're talking about this morning man right so then by the prophet bringing it to us it was the holy spirit upon the prophet right see the anointing was upon the man to bring us the message the anointing was upon each of these writers that we read of matthew mark luke and you john peters the the anointing was upon them to write what god was saying to us all right that was that anointing but without that anointing inside of us or the anoint anointed god inside of us the new birth then we'll only get an intellectual conception and no matter how much intellectualism you get even if you've got it to work that it's perfect uh brother george let's see brother uh thomas might remember who it was brother george his brother um mo and brother tatum and them i think was talking to a man from some uh what bob jones university was it seemed like it was some university that the guy came down to actually try to you know talk them out of the true one one true living god and you know and he could quote the entire bible by memory now that's wonderful i mean i wish i had it but it's like i said this morning i can't carly quote john 3 16. you said no i don't want to be ashamed but i am but i've never tried to learn it by memory i tried to read it to see what is being said to me and that way then i i want it that way but see it didn't matter if we could if we could get it all you know satan he has a great understanding a great understanding of the bible but does that make him born again i mean you try to quote within the message he knows it i gave you one quote in our word this man wrote around and said that he had the understanding of the bible or understanding of the word to tell the eve in other words right he had things back there that we wouldn't think about he had a knowledge of the principles of life and what it would consist of and how the the the egg and the germ would mix between the beast and eve right he had a lot of understanding and anytime you think you can out quote the devil you're in bad shape you know because he knows it but he only knows it the prophet said by intellectual conception you don't know it by holy ghost experience well now that don't put it see when you start talking like that people say well what do you mean you don't want us to read the bible you want us to be illiterate i didn't say that now right i didn't say you need to be illiterate because the bible says study to show yourself a proof a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth right exactly so then don't don't go into the state of confusion when i'm trying to speak just go with what i'm talking about and listen don't get out ahead of me see that's the worst thing in the world you get out ahead of the preacher and you get out ahead of me a lot of times you get your limb sawed off you've done that so don't do it because you think i'm going this way and i don't know that way all right but now just think about what we're trying to say see jesus according to the scriptures had not been crucified according to john 7 38 39 and he the scripture said of that said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water referring to the day of pentecost when it would come right but see they couldn't understand that why because at that time if you go on reading there it says because the holy ghost had not been given because jesus had not been glorified all right so you can have your understanding opened and listen that's the only way you know how that i preached all of everybody's ever been around here anytime at all well the older ones with us i've always taught you that we must have the seat so down in the field before the rain can fall on it you know i mean you know you stand there and you got your seat in your hand he said boy bless look look at my corn man look at my corn you don't see my corn right no put it in the ground all right sow the seeds let the rain come and then we'll be we'll see you've got corn see all right see but has god opened our understanding you know to the scriptures or is it revealed to us right now let me illustrate then brother branham had the opening of his understanding of the scriptures to be able to tie together things and all but yet until the holy spirit spoke to him he believed that the white horse rider was the holy ghost and that's your prophet ma'am but see don't you think he had a great understanding he read continually don't you think he understood but yet there was something there that was withholding from him now could it be that away with you and i amen right see i wrote it this way there's a vast difference between having an understanding open and having a revelation right of what is understood there's a vast difference in it right and that way as i said you can tell it because a revelation will keep you but head knowledge will just lead you to more head knowledge yeah you know it just keep blowing you up and you'll start trying to figure out words and figure out why this and why that or like we said this morning you know then you'll read the scripture and you'll say see there the bible said i don't need nobody to teach me the holy ghost is my teacher but see why did he put teachers in the body right if the holy ghost is only the things you need all right then it's like i said you know i know i'm i know that when i talk i talk blunt that way you don't misunderstand me i don't think there's anybody now you might not know what i'm saying you might understand what i'm saying i'm trying to get it but you think one thing about it you don't misunderstand my language go see then if god can quicken it we don't have to worry about it but if he don't quicken it it's just his knowledge that's right it's a concept or a thought while we run around and make this statement he said i don't believe that we're getting the people to christ we're getting them to a church he said that's right all right may i phrase it on we're getting into a doctrine we're getting them to an idea but if all you have is head knowledge about a doctrinal situation somebody can come along and convince you different of that he can show you where this greek word means this and that greek word means that and you put your punctuation here and you put the digits in and when you wind up well that's great and like i told you i didn't have the baptism in the holy ghost and brother mo all he had to say to me he said what do you believe that's a bad disbelief and one god he said explain it to me i said god three persons blessed trinity he said your as trinitarian as everything else is because to be a person as a personality personality is an individual individual to person well you know i didn't have to i didn't get mad and run to the books and read and try to find out what dr show and show said about it or who said about it or whatever or what school i looked at him i said well don't believe that no more i didn't know what to believe maybe but i didn't believe that right i never did no more i have been believing god in three persons because he doesn't prove his point to me all right see then that way see our understanding can be opened but we need the revelation see we can have the mechanics as brother branham will describe it are the words shown down in our heart but we need the dynamics the disciples had the word david even it says thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against the david love god's word they loved that word so much back there in the old testament one time until they found a scroll that they didn't know existed and the bible said they stood for six hours while they read that scroll and they worshipped six hours that was people that's not even born again right man because there's no way to be born again in the old testament jesus christ that died yet that's right that's what i've given you that john 7 there because he hadn't been glorified numbers had been crucified see then could it be that what we have mostly is an understanding all right now don't don't misunderstand me we've got to have the understanding it's not revelation first right it's not that you pick up the bible oh man i see that you know you pick up a prophecy and that's what gets me you know and i'm sorry but i try to emphasize it to hit you but people tell you boys when i i read that and that's it i just picked up a book and i read and god revealed it right there and i see it well why has everybody else fought it out for 40 years you know i mean you know and i'm not saying it don't happen right i'm just saying it didn't happen to me but you see we need the word shown down in us those disciples had that word by the lord jesus now that's what people say you know i'm gonna stay home and listen to tapes and i'm not gonna do nothing just listen to brother and i'll get first hand well the disciples got three and a half years of firsthand information from a man they could question about what he was talking about and they still wound up with no understanding you agree they wound up at the end of it and didn't know what in the world he was talking about that's right and he has explained it to him it expounded on it and that's what he done with the disciples he opened their understanding but that didn't give him the new birth well brother dale you know i studied the message i believe i got the holy ghost because what's in me agrees with the word well it's okay if it keeps on agreeing amen preach the message right preachers we don't talk about the leftists i get on the preachers i don't worry about the laity i don't have no trouble with laity i have trouble with preaching it but you see preachers 30 40 years that they've been in this message hunted fished and lived basically with the prophet or something and then you see of the worst confused people has ever been about what the prophet had to say because i exposed it but people don't realize who the ones that you expose is the problem you know but you see i've been accused of being an intellectual why after 40 years why would you be intellectual i don't mind saying that after 40 years you study one message but could it be that we we read over it right and still that's a point too you know it's not time to understand something you know what you get it and you read over it the message has now of course they're changing a whole lot of it we we find that out with the computer systems and things and if everybody here was on to the new version of that they have out from jeffersonville i'd click over to it to bring any quotes from it because there is a better opportunity so we have to use two versions our computer system will not handle the old version and put it on the internet so we have to translate it into the new version of it to be able to take it out onto the to the internet system right so you know so i started today happy and richard and him that's what jonah has to do see i give them a quote from something i give them one in this it's a page 26 revelation of jesus christ we'll see then they've got to go run that into the computer and there under the new message because it won't accept this part to be able to put it on the iron so you know a lot of things in understanding but still i'm not arguing with nobody i just said we all had it i found a lot of misunderstandings between it and found like even studying on this message if you run in uh open open our understanding you'll find more under the new version than you do under the old but you'll also find that they change some words and they use opening instead of open me and you know they'll change in to buy or something because they're upgrading the best they can do and i'm not arguing with nobody i'm just telling you all right i'm telling you that's what we do with understanding understanding is progressively uh progressing what is it understanding would be progressive knowledge in other words you keep on growing and going you know and understanding uh we didn't need to know how to fly an airplane a hundred years ago i mean the wright brothers was just beginning to talk about it and if you heard the story about it their daddy took them out of a meeting where this guy prophesied that they would one day they would come forth somebody and they would fly through the sky and they said that daddy got to took these two boys out of the building that's what was told now and you don't want to argue on whatever right you know the two guys that did start the playing later but the the point i'm trying to get it is we believe in progressive understanding all right now if do let me ask you do you believe this do you believe in progressive revelation not added revelation right no no no no no not different revelation progressive right something being revealed to you here and then later more on it more on it more well then if it is that means you're going to have to have progressive understanding right right right i mean that's simple right progressive revelation would require progressive understanding you know or grow development and all like that that's what we're doing here see but now while we're on that part where i won't forget it because it's in my mind then it is i've tried to preach to you that if we don't have the word stoned down correctly my brother brown would be so um he said so zealous of the word that he had sown right he said to sort down pure and unadulterated that's what it i think it's uh what it spoken words written and said he said the seed has been sewn down pure and unadulterated from all mankind all right now you know at that time he made that statement was 1962 and at that time he didn't know the white horse writer was the antichrist he didn't know that was 63. see so his understanding was progressive as he came along all right see the bible even said jesus grow to grace and knowledge all right now but get that's why i think that we don't see things maybe you don't look at it like i do because see jesus goes out and he gets baptized he goes out into the wilderness you know in the desert and he comes back and when he comes back then he walks into the temple one day and and they handed him a book and he did he set personal let's see what am i going to read no he probably opened it up right right there and he looked down and he realized they're 62 or 61 that which one it is there you know where it says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel right he folds the book he lays it down as i said this morning i had those in the notes this morning to bring the greatest anointing of all was there sitting in the temple and what did it say precious words proceeded forth from it he went running all over the building shouting glory hallelujah he was sitting down talking to him the prophet i gave you the quotes this morning anointing is supreme power in control see we call it shouting it's all right when you shout it's like i like what the prophet said he said it's okay to shout and jump up in the air he said but make sure you walk straight when you come back down see that's not quoted a lot all right they quote the shout out to glory hallelujah you know but they don't quote that you know make sure you walk straight now if you got the holy ghost see you're going to walk straight you see him i can't get away from the morning's message all right so brother branham covers i gave you three quotes there about the opening of the understanding so you can read those as you go along that he opened the understanding of the disciples you know the lord jesus did he even uses the word expounded on the one that's the one called a court trial 1964 even says he expounded upon the scriptures all right now he opened their understanding of the scriptures now listen that didn't give them the new birth but you know what had he not opened their understanding of the scriptures they could not have gotten a new birth right it was not because they happened to wind up in a room and they said where are you going tonight you got something to eat yeah we're going to an upper room sit down these i think i'll go along with you not knowing nothing about what's going on no no no no no you've heard the prophet said they were up there maybe one of them said i think we've got it we know we've got our commission healed of sick cast out devils preach the gospel let's go do it and said one of them said yeah but said what jesus said hasn't taken place yet so they had their understanding opened as to what they were to be and how they would have a ministry and what it was to bring but they did not have the revelation of jesus christ dwelling within them but had they not had it shown down that's my point now listen that's why it's required then and i didn't write this bible nor the prophets made it but it's required that we believe in a five-fold ministry see it's required it's not something that we can take or leave right i didn't make the statements brother said that the faculty minister for the perfecting of the saints right all right then if somebody don't throw that word down it can't be quickened that's right is that sensible or not people call me deep now how deep is that simplicity is the deep end of anything now you think it goes either way don't don't that's right god is hidden and revealed in simplicity as you go down right i grew up right simplicity is intellectual no i don't have no intellect i got the holy ghost it's all right go ahead but you see now with all behind and what i've said that even brutal branham thought his understanding was opened and thought the white horse rider was the holy ghost well yet when it was revealed it wasn't correct see he didn't come in there and said well bless god i tell you what i'm still going to believe what i'm going to believe no he took what the holy spirit had to say and he said here it is my point is this there is show me anywhere now i want somebody i challenge you in the bible show me anywhere in the bible that they receive the holy ghost without hearing the message anybody can find it bring it to me any word in the bible if they receive the holy ghost without first hearing a message right that's why i tried to explain the day of pentecost is what brother brown would say i met people got the holy ghost 50 years before just like the day of pentecost why because in the upper room you had a group of people that had been tutored and trained for three and a half years and had their understanding open and the holy ghost fell and it gave them what we call the faith of the fathers which is right here not that headstone now that's love and i mean not it see all right but see when the holy ghost fell on the 3000 outside it could only give them the new birth that faith because they didn't have the word of understanding see what's happened happening all these years god has been opening our understanding of the scriptures at least he has mine i mean that's that's the way i do and why i preach it away that's why i'll preach something and then i'll come back years later and i'll pick it up and go on up a step or two and sometimes i'll go up one step and sometimes i go four or five but you know that's what i believe right i believe in progressive revelation and i come and tell you what god has said to me all right see then that way our understanding is open it doesn't mean that it's revealed see the mechanics is the showing down of the word the opening of your understanding it's the mechanics the word being read and understood and really getting to the basis i'm like this i've come to the basis that brother branham said certain things and that there's no other way he could have said it beside that i hear people say well he should have said this and he should have said that he should have the order said no he could have said no other way amen because that's what it means that was what god wanted so it's the bible that way but we need somebody to open our understanding now that's where you find full ministry comes in now if anybody out there any word surely would have any idea that brother dale is against people reading and studying the message you come and talk to these people that are sitting here where i tell them you are to read and study the bible more than i do you ought to know more about this message than i know about it because you don't have to study for a sermon you can just read i have to read related to what i'm going to preach on and then on a rare occasion i get to read a book or listen to a tape see because you know i'm studying in a line and i want to keep it in that line and that's why when i preach it that i don't worry about getting you know garbage back off the internet well you missed it here and you missed it there i'm sure one of these days they'll do it but hadn't done it yet and you know out there as much as it is that they sure love to do it but that's the point now not if we're that good it's the holy ghost is that good he's the one that's protected us not me he's been the holy ghost but see you must hear the word before the word can be quickened that's right you somebody's got to preach it that's where the preacher comes in how can we hear the bible saying without a preacher right is that bible that's right but see you don't hear the preacher quote the rest of it he wants to quote that end of it but the rest of it says if he'd be sin how can he preach unless he's sent you know to say they just got went but that's just jokes where they not even make about the bible but you see if somebody don't preach it to us we can't get an opening of our understanding right that's right well i just read the prophet well amen like i told a man one time i said he's telling me about you know how that these people just listening to the tastes it's fine i said you show me a church listening to taste only listen to tapes and i'll show you backslidden bunch of people and i don't mean backstage it's not going to church that's automatic but i said i'll show you about to live much people i said you want to argue the point he said my brother is i said yep his backslid he finally said yeah you're right yeah yep all right that's what i'm saying people without someone to help us what is it and uh phillip with ethiopian unit right now he was reading the scrolls of isaiah and he said is this man talking about himself or another reading understanding open right he just simply told him what that meant you said told me what yeah it meant exactly what it said it says you know where the bible just plain saying like this say in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters do this and my handmaids will do this see your sons antichrist serpent seed because the spirit's poured out now upon all flesh anointed ones brother branham didn't change that reading you know he changed our understanding of what we had read you agree yes right that's what we needed to change our understanding we read it and swore oh wait man we took that bible we swore that was three gods oh look at that look at that look at that look at that we swore by them being three gods now we can swear by they're just being one but is what's changed is it a revelation or just an intellect that you got just a head knowledge the prophet of god said pray for a revelation he said you need revelation more than you need anything pray for a revelation all right see like i told you one time i had something came up and and i had notes written for to preach on a message and uh i was getting ready to preach it and i would have challenged anybody because i had the quote had the bible and everything and god didn't argue with me he didn't talk to me you know what he said now this is all he said he said if you do that you make your type greater than your antitype that's all he said he didn't explain to me what he was talking about he didn't explain the scriptures that i had messed up he didn't show me anything like that he just told me if you do that you'll get your type will be greater than your antitype well see how can you type be greater than your anatomy your type is like a a canoe you know and an anti-top is like an ocean liner you know see you know the the blood of a lamb is a type of the blood of jesus christ see if you go you go backwards you you've got a problem you're trying to go back you'd want you wouldn't want to go out there to segment noon and get in a an old t model now donnie would but you know he's just that away he'd go right home to t modeled and and then a cadillac but that's his way he didn't get a little older he won't care nothing about it he wants our conditioner turned on but listen the anointing of the holy spirit wouldn't it be then i'm asking you the question wouldn't it be then that the anointing of the holy spirit would be on our intellectualism and that would be why we would be called in anointed ones is it not true that brother branham says that they take part of the word and make it work is that a quote okay even your uh uh deals of spiritualism we have been told and i've witnessed a little bit but not just talking with people but brother brown said it they travel in the three high names father son and holy ghost you know they're based on the bible they've got an understanding made of this scripture but then they take it to themselves and then make it spiritualism what about it but get the point now how can we hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sin if he don't have the holy spirit within him to be able to bring it out then all of his expounding upon it will not do any good because i've asked you this question many times how can the holy spirit quicken error when your prophet says it can't be done that's right that shouldn't need a revelation to think he would quick an arrow you know i heard a man one time he said boy i shouted over the trinity and i shouted the truth i said well you're shouting that was good but i'd hate to make the statement i shouted over the trinity you know to think it was right see but see we need somebody to take the message and and break it down to us as to understanding it now that's what brother brown said and brother ray give me the quote that's on what is it because i should have brought it but he said these young men will take this and sweep it on to the coming of the lord that's right things that are to be brought around said that these young men will take it and sweep it on to the coming of the lord you know i'm not qualified much in that young anymore it was back then but it's all right but he said they'd sweep it on he said in other words i break it down in big nuggets he left a job for the fivefold ministry that's right he left a job and that same anointing that was in the lord jesus was then brother around speaking it and then that must be in the thoughtful ministry or they won't speak it correctly and if they won't speak it correctly how can the holy spirit that's even in you quicken something that's not true all right good amen he's having to sort out what is not right and tell you those things are not right that's why we must have a faithful ministry that's not making me a job i don't consider preaching a job i consider it the greatest opportunity to ever be who wasn't years ago was gonna probably gonna step down from being a preacher and run for president now that's the biggest shame of anything could ever be yeah y'all call him i didn't put his name back but you mean me step down from preaching the gospel the greatest position of anywhere in the world behind a 90 little people in lula georgia and me step down and run for president don't ask me i'd be ashamed i'm in the highest position in this world to stand and try to speak to you about what god has given me and i don't speak to you unless he gives it to me about something yeah sure i know the bible is preaching sermon yeah that's what people think and that's what they think preaching is all right so listen a minute and i'm not see you admit you misunderstand me i'm sorry people think preaching is emotionalism that i was saying this morning to work that they get you involved into the message because that's where we would brother dick might not remember we was up at a minister's meeting and that guy got people involved and brother dick richard punched me and said he said he's trained he's trying but you know what happened at the end of this after it's over with he spoke and i spoke now here was this man i know what he's trying to do so don't misunderstand me i know he was trying to get in my pocket and win me so i ain't worried about it because i wouldn't get one you know but he said you got what i went to school to learn i said what that's what he said so you got what i want school to learn right he says you got it from this natural he said i'll trade with you any day i believe the man meant the truth about it right of course i know he's trying to get me in his pocket with him ride his horse with him but i wouldn't want to ride that horse because they used to ride it out west and bury the books like all these others did but anyhow uh i'm just i'm just me but i believe that somebody has to expound it to us well now brother dale who do you listen to i listen to all the five-fold ministries i get a chance to because i am one person that believes in a five-fold ministry i've told you before and tell you again if i could find a real true prophet that i knew and could put the confidence in that man as a prophet in the fivefold ministry not outside of all these other garbage cans i'd call him in and tell him says start with me at the front and go to the back and tell every one of us what's wrong with us that's right but that would be what a prophet would be dealing with those things you see i believe in the five-fold ministry and i believe it so much that i believe that this thing is hinged upon whether or not you can listen to a fifo ministry and believe that god has spoken to you but if god could use a dumb donkey to speak right or a rooster to crow for anointed ones to preach a message to you why can't we believe in at least the anointing forget the person know i don't have the mannerism the the the things you know of of being a preacher i i've never tried to be that's joyce what kind of clothes i wear walmarts red green pink and blue with tennis shoes and then tore all the pieces you know because i'm just myself and i just about wear that here if you wouldn't for the fact that you're just not supposed to be that way because i love my old blue jeans i ain't like brother gary now the gary loves them with holes in them but i like mine to be a little better now but now get get what i'm saying the five-fold ministry is supposed to be for the perfecting of the science right now i believe and i'm going to say it so just go ahead i believe that that has been the one of the biggest hindrances that this message has ever had is the people cannot believe in the faithful ministry all right now i'm going to be first up try to tell you that if you're talking about a lot of these preachers around the country i don't believe in them either okay no problem but i don't believe in living like the devil and having four wives and and 19 kids and and all of these garbage cans you've got that claim to be preachers in this mission but you know what they're just popular you go to these meetings somewhere oh there's old brothers i'm going over shake bro and show his hand and this guy standing over there that could help you like everything him i'd rather be there that's what they're saying you know but i believe that our problem is we don't believe in the ministry amen and i told you i don't blame you i blame the ministry that's what sent us on the internet folks it's me going out among people and go out and it got heartbreaking to go and people and you'd see them want to come and talk to you they want to ask you questions and i said listen i can't answer questions but just going we we do have the tapes and things you know i'm not trying to win anybody but just if you want to hear what i've said about it go to the internet or go to the identity old taping system and you know what a lot of them say i can't do it my pastor won't let me well that just that tore my heart because they want to hear the truth but your pastor won't let them right so i just opened up and said okay be what you want to call me what you want to it's on the internet you listen to it and i'm not out you under trying to win churches and win people to the message and i mean you know to this church to come here i've never said that all right but you see i don't believe that we trust the fivefold ministry and you know really i don't believe we understand a five-fold ministry now this is my whole point i believe that it's going to take the fivefold ministry to expound upon the scriptures see for us to be able to come to the place to understand brother branham's message because why would it be the way he said that was what it was to be the bible said that was what it was to be why would it be an argument about it see people get upset with me for bringing that out and then like one brother said one time he said i think brother dale's a teacher and brother just sneered like everybody he said what are you i'm a pastor he said well that's just one of them you know there's five of them what's the problem with brother dale being a teacher if you're a pastor but you know the pastors are in no way gonna turn around and turn the money back into the tape recorders right they're going to be pastors with the money in the pocket but then they're going to be well you can't listen on these other stuff you know beware be careful you get confused in other words beware who would it uh uh it was back there one of them might have been um i forgot hey and one trip said don't go down and find out you're already confused one of the great events said that one time because they said don't go down and get confused he said don't go down and find out you're already confused but see i don't believe we can understand the five full minutes right with all of that said i don't blame people see because you hear preachers they'll preach something then six months later they're on something else and six months later on something else and and then they run off into the world and they're out doing all kind of you know and it's made a shame and a disgrace to be called a preacher i don't like that i don't even like to be called a preacher call me brother why because there's so many garbage can preachers the poor old laity what can they do brother around said he said sheep lead out of a garbage can in the house too because they've got to live right right but the bible says jesus to the pharisees you stand in the door and you won't go in and you won't let them go in we see we need somebody to open their understanding right amen and it's not to open us understand that we need to fight for ministry that's fine right right all right that's the book is brother dick that's it brother brattle said it that's it it's not that but to open our understanding of the things brother brown has said right that the bible has said right see like i gave the illustration the other day how many of you would love to have a revelation that the bible and the prophet said by having a new birth you're just as righteous as god is all right what i'd love for that to be revealed to me i'd be running all over this place wouldn't you i could see it right and then i'll lose it right now find it right right exactly right one day i'm doing pretty good the next day involved in the hell i feel it like it is i don't play around but you see he gave some apostles now i've explained that to you right he gave some prophets some evangelist some pastor some teacher a lot of people think that he just gave something he just looked moved down like that i i never have believed that i believe he gives you what you need that's why i said he gave some apostles to emphasize some people need a teacher some people can get bible just a a pastor but i just never was that way and and i just want to hear more you know and i'm always wanting desire to hear now listen i'm trying to get a point to you where he says he opened their understanding i'm not talking about revelation okay okay because i can't reveal anything to you right brother can't reveal anything to you the lord jesus said in my own life did not reveal that that's paraphrasing what brother brown said it was sitting there he said only the holy ghost christ the mr god revealed the holy ghost is the only revealer of the world no man can do it but if it's not sewn down as i said while ago if it's not thrown down correctly how can the holy ghost quicken it that's what's been wrong for 40 something years and while we're here it's because it that even just a little thought in your ideas as i said a moment ago when i had that message and the lord spoke to me i thought it was a message and he said you make your top variant top you know i shredded that thing man i burned it i done everything i didn't want nobody to know what i had written down because it was wrong and i knew it was wrong again but listen we need somebody to come on the scene to open our understanding now when i say this it's been for 40 almost 40 something years standing behind here that you know i've said this the first time i read the bible not the baptist church joined the baptist church 1958 and i i thought well if i'm going to be a christian i have been to church all my life up and down but if i'm going to be a christian i need to know what god said in his word so i set out to read the bible of course we all got stars for doing them but i wouldn't care about stars i won't know what he said right when i got to malachi 3 and malachi 4 i went to my wife and i told her i said according to what my understanding of the bible is here that there's going to be two prophets come before the end of the world and you know i i just read it malachi 3 at melchizedek well when brother began to talk to me about god sending the prophet i said words of that in the bible he said malachi 4. i said okay explain malachi 3. he said john the baptist i said put it in the scripture he said well here it says it didn't turn the hearts of the fathers to the children you know where it goes there in the loop i think it is but i said okay but we understood this to be on down further in the verse that said that he turned the disobedient to the he said yep and if you did you turn them right back where you brought them from yeah right if john turned them this way and then turn them back you go right back where you started okay you know that over my understanding right the point is i believe the bible and by reading it over and over you get a a better understanding you quote it to me a lot because it's true that you read the bible one time or you read the prophet's message one time and you get something and you go back and read the same message or the same scripture and you get more not a different meaning right if you get a different meaning something wrong with one of the two it can't be both of them's right so you get a better understanding of what's happening and that's going into your intellectual instrument but then every once in a while god drops it down i said every once in a while because that's the way i believe it and that's why he does it to me you ought to be surprised sometimes i i preach for three months on something i don't know where in the world i'm going from here i don't know what i'm going to preach on and i'm in that stage and we'll take some sermons and i know what i'm preaching and know what i'm trying to preach that we're getting the understanding of the change of the body but you know but then something will help my boy that's wonderful but you get in that about three or four sermons and all at once you see the end of what you're talking about you say lord come on please please john said lord come quickly because i'm running out you know and i never said no problem about it wouldn't bother me to come call wait sunday morning and say what you're going to preach or ain't going to have no services and i don't have anything that wouldn't bother me no more taking a drink of water but you know god's been gracious he's always helped me because right about that times when he opens a lot to you right all right but you see we he meets us along the way and reveals the scriptures to us every once in a while he could we couldn't stand it for him to reveal it all at one time it just wouldn't work we would be so much out of it we would just we wouldn't be human see but he gradually opens the scriptures by revealing them but if we don't keep putting it into the field that's right that's why i encourage you listen to the tapes read the prophet's message study a workman that needed not be ashamed rightly dividing how are you going to know whether i'm telling you the truth or not that's right you got to know it by what's made known to and you the lord jesus gets in and sometimes he leaves you kind of where he lives and he don't answer you you've done that you asked him about something he lazy don't ask you i remember years ago and his certain brother said certain things the church i was in and i prayed lord and and i fasted and i said lord you know i'm gonna fast do you speak to me about this because it's it's desperate to me you know in my life and i told you about it and brother was reading a book and he said brother they'll explain this well i went three days faster and he said explain this i can't understand well i took the book and just looked at it and there was exactly what i had asked the lord about in letters laying in front of me don't use the bible in the message for we see which one but i've never you know i've told you when i've always had to get something from god i took the bible and dropped it don't do that dear god that's not your calling that's not your ways don't do that with god that's something between me and god that's right but he's never failed i mean to the words on the page one time it didn't work and i said lord it's never failed me before now lord what's wrong and i thought well you know i just i got into it myself lord and i'm sorry you know i was crying and apologizing i'm sorry he said go back to the top of the page because see when i put my finger there my answer would be exactly what i'd read the verse scripture he said go back to the top of the page i didn't listen i kept home he'd come again go back to the top of the page i just turned and looked back at the top of the page there was in very words exactly what i'm asking but see uh don't do that because you're not called for that it's something god told me that don't make me nothing and i'm not i don't do that to try to get you to believe me if if you can't know what i preach you don't need a sign a sign wouldn't do you any good if you can't believe what somebody preaches right out of the bible that's right that's really i don't talk about the things sometimes that god shows me because i don't want you to build up on some something i want you to build up on what this bible says but this bible says god will do these things amen he will open our understanding of the scriptures that's right but it may be a while before he reveals it to us but don't get just disenchanted along the way ask god for a revelation like i told you that brother said what do you mean in revelation yeah it is a revelation it's not a revelation just to be able to read brother around his books you're right that's not a revelation that's right but israel robertson's got it you can walk on a revelation you don't have to worry about that that's right if somebody could come along right now and take away from you and you believe in one god and they deprogram you and convince you a trinity you know god in three persons blessed are a river jordan doctrine that you're trying to do in the message to say that jesus wasn't god for the river jordan and they'd be programming the people you say brother dale you know see we should call names but we don't because a lot of you listen to them that are teaching that just be careful because you it's going to catch you or you're going to learn it's wrong right that's right it's going to catch you and then i'm going to have to say something i don't like that i i want to be a brother in christ is trying to help you see the message and to believe that we need to believe the message we need to believe the prophets made we need to believe about we need to believe the faithful minutes but we need to believe each other right brother branham was so gracious a person a man was telling him about a dream that he had to remember and and it was about his wife was supposed to be this that or the others he'd forgive her that he said i wanted to believe that god told him that but he said he did he said cause it's contrary to the word he said you women preachers i'm not going to tell you that god didn't call you to pray you know why because the anointing didn't call them to preach on their spirit right right but he said i'm going to tell you it's not according to the bible all right forget what i'm saying another minute or two a preacher actually he needs to study he needs to prepare he needs to say things in a way but yet you don't have to now i write my sermons i i do i write mine a lot of preachers don't write them i write my sermons all right notes and you see the see the blue and the yellow that blue means it's found upon the yellow means pick it up say something about it the white says if you got time okay but you see the preacher needs to go before the lord and do as we said this morning he needs the inside teacher himself all right and then he needs to go before god and get a message and bring it to the people and then god will use him in the correct way because he'll expound upon the scriptures and as he does then the holy spirit can speak to you that's right right because right around said a preacher is nothing in the world he said his gift is to just to be able to break satan's spell over your eyes right where god can speak straight to you now how do you break a spell over people die hocus pocus jiminy occurs we're gonna catch some dust out we're gonna clear your mind no the only way i know to get anybody's mind in the right order is preach the gospel because according to my bible now listen my bible says that the gospel is the power of god unto salvation see because you can't have salvation without hearing the gospel show me one time they received any holy ghost in the bible without hearing the message first right impossible right but god is breaking it down to us in the end time to try to get us to believe the message that has been brought into us i believe everything the prophet said people swear by that it's all right i know what you're talking about i've made them too but is it revelation oh he's right that's it now revelation will heal you intellect will try to convince you not to go to the doctor because you need faith intellect will take you to the doctor because you realize you don't have it but revelation will heal you he'll deliver you and anybody's ever been healed knows what i'm talking about see some people's never had an instant healing or style of healing you know enough to worry that they can just put it on that basis and say that was it but you see it's not my job to find some trick rabbit hat something to be able to uh cast some dust or something over you to open your eyes it's my job to preach the gospel right because did you notice the scripture now said the gospel the good news now listen what i'm saying please it doesn't say the quickened word right there it says the gospel is the power of god unto the quickened word okay the gospel is the power of god unto salvation that's why i'm so careful the way that i try to preach and i don't mean the mannerism in style i'm sorry about that i'm sorry but that goes with me just forgive me and forget it i see you sleepy i see you do everything i try to do everything i can to break you away from that i see you following this time and i try to do that i try to make a funny face to get you to believe or whatever you know that's just part of me but what does the gospel say that's where i've always asked one question anybody leisure to show me where i'm off the word where are you going whatever is your business but please come show me where i'm off the word if i am because i want to be right sure i'm stubborn mule-headed and everything in the world yes sir because you are too too stubborn stubborn because you got your idea you're trying to convince me or you wouldn't be trying to tell me it's off right but you see this thing is not made to just play around with this this is a gospel to believe this message was to be made where we could live it and living the message see once now i'm going to make a life statement of what i'm doing now if we believe in progressive understanding all right progressive revelation upon the understanding would not have come to a place one day to where the bible would be correct and we know the bible is correct but i'm just making a point the bible says there'll come a time when the uh what if the sword will catch up with the reaper which way is that somebody quote it to me i just happen to think of that scripture but there's a there's a place there that the sower and the reaper are going to be together now how is that in the world it can't be you can't slow and then reach back down and get your corn out of the grain that's but in the bible there's to be a place come that the sower and the reaper will be running together because that's former and latter rain all right see because what you've heard today if god quickens it to you if you only get it in your understanding it's former rain if it's quick on this ladder right right but you know what tomorrow what you have today is only form of rain why because every day there's a word is that true give me this day in my daily bread that's why the prophet would preach so much on former latter reign then he preached on dynamics and mechanics mechanics is a refilling of the holy ghost i gave it to you there this morning we didn't read it it was a refilling of the holy ghost i'm expecting that i'm expecting another day of pentecost we're not that we're gathered in up a room but we're gathered around the world to the word of god and a snoring will strike home that will just fill every fiber of our being and we'll go out of here but to do that we've got to hear what faith cometh by your ear and hearing by the word see if we don't hear the word we can't have faith all right so then let's just keep piling the word in all right amen if we're around here 20 more years would you still be saying something but because i said this 40 years ago keep piling the word again ask brother ray of some of these statements that i made 20 years ago or 30 because he's taking it off and putting it on the dvds for your cds and things for you you know all right but you see i believe that they'll come a place now you'll have to take and i'd have to take blood mode for it anyway because i never i've looked it up to try to find the point of it made but it made the point to start but there's a place in in um revelation that it's called linguistics now linguistics doesn't mean language that's what you're thinking automatically linguistics means language no no linguistics means that you have reached a place where nothing else can be said i believe that that's why i'm not looking for another prophet to come because if i did he'd have something else to say i believe god brought us the message i'm looking for a people to come in that message to the place right amen and i'll go ahead and say it to you because it's what i believe not a new thing because you've heard it i believe we have enough faith right now to raise all of the dead down through time i believe the revelation is here to be able to raise up all of those down through time but if around the world and i said around the world i didn't say in one individual so don't misunderstand that statement around the world the prophet's message is going to be in the bride of christ until it will be exactly the way he brought it and nothing else can be added you talk about an august presence then god will come on the scene i hope i got my point across you can have an understanding open and it not be a revelation but you can have a revelation but you'll never have it until your understanding is first open so if i'm not preaching the truth you have my permission to go wherever you desire but if they're preaching something more than i do this please let me have the opportunity to hear you know because i want change we fought around horrible enough folks that's right it's time to go into the promised land we've heard these stories for a long time but it's time for it to be revealed what do you think about it have you had your understanding opened to the scriptures but just don't call that the holy ghost now it see back up to the morning message if it wasn't for the preacher preaching it it wouldn't so it is an anointing it is the holy ghost that opens your understanding that's the point i've been trying to make the holy ghost opens your understanding but it doesn't mean he reveals it because there's more to be brought so he can open our understanding of the scriptures and we can see things but don't quit the prophet of god standing there on those seals and i remember went through it for years and all and preaching and studying on it and everything with that our general motors running a job that it took two people to run the day i was out and everything and so fast and i was standing there working and doing and the lord was dealing with me about the opening of the seals and i was working with a 4000 heater and uh you know and there all at once he just dropped something down into my heart and he said did not the prophet saying here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and now fire goes the white horse rider said then if you see two people in the bible one of them's got to be the antichrist because there ain't no two gods that quickened that seal right there into my heart i knew then and i didn't have no problems so when i got home i looked to see and that's exactly what the prophet said about 158 of the seal book but he was speaking from my memory of what i had read that's right and telling me you think i'm worried about anybody turn that down no because i know it's true i love the lord don't choose the boy here let's try number 275 i was sure of my me me i give you a present you said look at it i can tell you all that's in the box i want to see let me get inside the box i want to see what's in there i just want to add in the gospel i spent my life trying to help you to see what the prophet has said depart i had a quote on that this morning and you'll look at one of those on the anointed one brother we're talking about the anointed ones and how they you know yourself and he said he's going to argue i want what is he never said that he said the call to preach wherever i'm called to preach this mystery he said the message paul was to preach with his call to break and all that it's a message that brother adam has brought to us let's break it down that's my call i'm proud to bring these things to you of jesus now you you are us give me is is oh just pray one for another remember this service is wednesday night and just pray the lord blessed and remember the ones going to the youth camp next weekend and everything and some of you are going to work and do things like that and we appreciate it appreciate all of the money that has been donated and the things to to be able to help brother berlin them to put on the thing and help the children and do stuff like that we appreciate everything and and you that are working you know that's that's wonderful uh we're trying if we can my wife and i'll probably ride up there like friday night like we did last time and just to be with them because we you know we appreciate the people doing what they can to help the young people and all and help everybody you know you know so it gives an opportunity but just tell these people how much you appreciate them i know they wouldn't ask us but is there anything else you guys need are you pretty well up on desserts and everything that you need you don't need any more here okay everything's taken care of thank you all right let's just pray and be dismissed remember one another father as we go our separate ways this day we ask that you would just dwell in our hearts and our lives and the lord you would speak to us to try to get us to see what what you're trying to get us to see and i said we need to believe you and we need to accept what you've said and then you just walk on and wait upon you to manifest yourself we love you and we thank you we ask you to just open our understanding because in that then we can be prepared for a revelation and lord to be prepared against the day of this change and the things that we're talking about we need the revelation of the change of the body we need the revelation to it to understand the redemption of it we need all these things and we believe lord it will come through the bride of jesus christ as the faithful ministry tries to break down what the prophet has said unto us not to try to interpret it to some way or make our own thoughts but to just say what he said but to say it in a way that the holy spirit can quicken it because that's what it has to be we love you and we thank you and just go with each one of us on the way home take care of everybody and give a safe journey touch those that are sick among us touch our wife lord remove this hurting and we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen oh it was on the way foreign remember what is hold on is
