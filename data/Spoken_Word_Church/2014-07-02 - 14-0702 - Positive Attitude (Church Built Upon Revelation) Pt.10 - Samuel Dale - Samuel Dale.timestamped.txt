[4:40] each one we love you and we thank you in
[4:42] Jesus name
[4:45] amen Hebrews
[4:51] 11 now Faith is the substance of things
[4:54] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[4:57] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[5:00] good report through faith we understand
[5:03] that the worlds were framed by the word
[5:06] of God so that things which are seen
[5:09] were not made of things which do appear
[5:13] all right let's go over to
[5:15] Matthew
[5:17] 16 and we'll begin reading in verse
[5:20] 13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[5:23] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[5:25] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[5:28] man am
[5:30] they said some say that thou art John
[5:32] the Baptist and some Elias and others
[5:33] jeremias are one of the prophets he
[5:36] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[5:39] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[5:43] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[5:44] Living
[5:45] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[5:48] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[5:50] Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[5:53] unto thee but my Father which is in
[5:55] heaven and I say unto thee
[6:00] now what that thou art Peter and Upon
[6:03] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[6:06] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[6:09] it meaning it'll be against it but not
[6:11] be able to Prevail and I will give unto
[6:14] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[6:16] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[6:18] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[6:20] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[6:22] loosed in heaven you may be seated the
[6:25] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[6:28] the word
[6:34] now
[6:37] okay all
[6:40] righty some will be faned and some will
[6:43] be tickled to death Joyce is green
[6:46] in she said hey it's nice
[6:50] warm don't tell nobody that it's warm in
[6:54] here nobody will never know
[6:56] it all right but now we've been talking
[7:00] for quite a while
[7:02] about
[7:04] faith and knowing that faith is the
[7:09] substance of things hope
[7:12] for in whatever you
[7:16] desire if you really have
[7:19] faith you have the
[7:22] substance of what that is that you're
[7:25] asking
[7:26] about but yet you can't see
[7:30] it you can't show it to anybody
[7:34] else why because it's something that you
[7:38] have and you have it alone and it goes
[7:41] back to that word of
[7:43] faith all right Faith
[7:48] Revelation now remember what we were
[7:50] talking about Sunday that you know Faith
[7:54] being a
[7:56] revelation all right now
[8:00] then whatever anything consist of it had
[8:04] to First have a beginning because it was
[8:07] a time that it had no beginning and it
[8:09] was of no uh what we call Earthly
[8:14] substance but God had in his
[8:18] mind all right and in his mind see as
[8:22] far as he was concerned it was already
[8:25] in
[8:27] existence right right amen now but yet
[8:32] there was no physical uh thing that
[8:35] would be uh said about it or talked
[8:38] about it as something that was back
[8:41] there because it
[8:42] was only in God's mind but yet in God's
[8:47] mind that was the actual whatever it
[8:49] would come
[8:51] from CU that's what the scripture says
[8:54] you know that that things that they do
[8:56] not appear in other words it wouldn't
[8:58] there but it it was brought from
[9:01] somewhere to there but not as we talked
[9:04] about Sunday afternoon you know where
[9:05] brother Brown said that the seed was
[9:07] laying there from another civilization
[9:10] well you know people want to know how
[9:11] many worlds was before this and what
[9:14] this was and what that was well I I
[9:17] don't look at that like that I look at
[9:20] it as being that the seed the life the
[9:23] world and the things came from God's
[9:28] mind right y all
[9:31] right and that would be another
[9:35] civilization right see we look at
[9:39] civilization as um houses cars trains uh
[9:43] planes Etc life but you
[9:49] know no matter what you would
[9:54] say there was a time that nothing didn't
[9:58] exist right all right but God
[10:01] alone okay all right then he began to
[10:06] bring into
[10:08] being and remember how we were trying to
[10:10] bring that out that he by
[10:14] faith he by
[10:17] Revelation how many times have you ever
[10:19] heard we were listening to tape the
[10:20] other night and brother R said said see
[10:22] there said God believed his own
[10:25] word you know I mean he believes his own
[10:28] word he said it but he believes his own
[10:30] word all right see because it all come
[10:34] from one substance we know that the
[10:36] Bible says that all things were created
[10:40] by the
[10:42] word all right see then whatever it is
[10:46] the word would be more sure than
[10:49] any tangible points or substance that we
[10:53] would talk about am so then that's why
[10:56] it goes back and the prophet would bring
[10:58] it to Faith being a
[11:04] revelation and have you ever had a
[11:06] revelation of
[11:08] something that you could not explain it
[11:11] to no one else but yet to you it was
[11:17] real but yet you try and other people
[11:20] just look at you you know even though
[11:25] maybe they had a revelation of one God
[11:30] but yet when you start talking about it
[11:33] it's still terminologies or words hides
[11:37] things from Mankind in the basis of
[11:40] trying to explain
[11:43] it and it really covers it up and puts
[11:46] it to where that you can't right you
[11:49] know the best thing to do is just say it
[11:51] and just go on cuz if you try to explain
[11:54] it you're going to get in trouble anyway
[11:57] cuz you're not going to have any words
[11:58] to explain it to them because until God
[12:01] speaks to them they don't know what
[12:04] you're talking about yet they've had
[12:06] many Revelations
[12:09] maybe right but they don't know what
[12:12] you're talking about all right see then
[12:15] that's to me is the most that's is the
[12:18] most simple thing that you could ever
[12:20] think of then as to be able to read
[12:23] Hebrews 11 and
[12:25] say faith is the substance
[12:30] of things hop
[12:32] for the evidence of Things Not
[12:35] Seen All right but then it goes on to
[12:38] say through
[12:41] faith understanding and it being made
[12:43] known to us we understand the worlds
[12:46] were framed amen by the word of God amen
[12:50] amen all right how do we understand
[12:53] that there was a time that we wondered
[12:56] how it got here right did this bang go
[13:00] off and this thing happened and what
[13:01] happened you know and and we wound up in
[13:04] the world and and all of that and I get
[13:07] to thinking about that sometimes and I
[13:09] really I get to laughing at at our own
[13:12] stupidity to think that we laid so you
[13:15] know the pows a different you laid so
[13:18] long over here and then you turned over
[13:19] here and you grow another arm and then
[13:21] you growed another arm and took all
[13:22] these years to keep growing
[13:24] Parts well then we've been around here
[13:26] now for about 6,000 years and hadn't
[13:29] growed any more parts I mean look like
[13:32] in that amount of time we'd growed
[13:34] something you
[13:36] know that's just the way I think about
[13:38] it but sorry just being that
[13:41] carnal all right but remember
[13:45] now a
[13:49] revelation has God ever
[13:51] revealed to
[13:53] you that he's real
[13:59] I mean are is or is it just based upon
[14:02] brother brandham said it Paul said it uh
[14:04] so and so said it mama said it grandma
[14:06] said it or is it something real to
[14:10] you now remember that no man can call
[14:12] the Jesus the Christ except what it be
[14:16] by the new
[14:17] birth right see something personal to
[14:21] you outside of that it's
[14:23] words right it's words it's thoughts
[14:27] it's things all right and see then it
[14:30] becomes down to the hour that we're
[14:33] living and and watch it in a minute when
[14:35] we get to that point
[14:39] that you know that God is not through
[14:44] creating
[14:51] right he's still creating his body right
[14:56] unless the LI one has come in and if it
[14:59] does there's still a lot of growth
[15:00] development that goes with all of that
[15:02] and
[15:03] things but you know if he's still
[15:07] creating then his creation is not
[15:11] finished right right watch it in a
[15:14] minute now we'll get back to that to
[15:16] where that the whole church is
[15:19] built upon
[15:22] Revelation see he that cometh to God the
[15:25] Bible says must believe that he is
[15:29] amen not he was or about him or heard
[15:33] about him or talked to somebody about
[15:35] him and you know no matter who it was
[15:38] that done to talking it's still not real
[15:43] until it comes something to
[15:46] you see then then I tell you that we
[15:49] have one true and living God right right
[15:52] but brother klees God is brother klees
[15:54] God that's how personal God is to each
[15:58] and every one of us
[16:00] all right so then I don't say I serve
[16:03] the god of William
[16:07] brandham see I don't say that I serve
[16:10] the god of the Apostle
[16:13] Paul
[16:15] no he's something personal to you and
[16:20] I all right then that brings it to where
[16:23] that we bring out you know that he that
[16:25] cometh to God must believe that he is
[16:27] present tense amen
[16:32] Faith then is present
[16:36] tense see bringing it down to where
[16:38] we're living and what has been the whole
[16:42] of
[16:43] thought the process that I've been
[16:46] trying to bring throughout these uh 10
[16:49] Services
[16:51] now about a positive
[16:55] attitude about seeing God for yourself
[16:58] that's right
[17:00] to not just be dependent upon what
[17:03] somebody else
[17:05] said even though that's wonderful right
[17:07] because Faith cometh by
[17:10] hearing right and hearing by the word
[17:14] all right but something to where that it
[17:17] can be real to you and me
[17:21] amen see then that way then you don't
[17:23] have any
[17:26] fear and see we went through now just
[17:29] going to I I cut out a lot of this and
[17:31] and I didn't give them the quotes now so
[17:33] in a minute we'll pick back up but you
[17:36] know a couple of messages now we've been
[17:37] kind of in into uh two different or two
[17:43] or three messages I had written
[17:45] down but remember
[17:48] now you cannot have a
[17:51] revelation the prophet said on the
[17:53] message of
[17:54] rapture without it being faith
[18:00] he said faith is a revelation because
[18:02] it's something that's revealed to
[18:07] you
[18:09] right it's a
[18:12] revelation you can't be
[18:16] saved without a revelation that's right
[18:19] you remember went through that uh Patman
[18:22] Vision he can only be known there's
[18:26] another paragraph about two over from
[18:28] where we were 69 of pma's vision that
[18:31] you can only be saved by Revelation he
[18:33] said he can only be known by
[18:35] Revelation and you can only be saved by
[18:39] Revelation he said you have a
[18:43] knowledge an
[18:45] intellectual
[18:46] part but if that's not revealed then
[18:50] you're not saved because you can't see
[18:52] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[18:55] the Holy
[18:57] Ghost something person in
[19:00] you not because the Bible says it right
[19:06] now listen not because the prophet said
[19:09] it not because Paul said it or
[19:12] grandmother said it or whatever it's
[19:14] when something is made real to you and
[19:17] you can only call him the Christ when
[19:19] you are born
[19:21] again cuz then and only then do you know
[19:24] anything about him
[19:28] you cannot be saved until he's
[19:32] made until you have that
[19:35] Faith all right
[19:39] now in doing that I
[19:41] realize what a lot of people's minds
[19:44] goes to
[19:45] then they'll say brother Dale you don't
[19:48] believe in in uh uh doing this or doing
[19:51] that or shouting or crying and this out
[19:53] of the other I don't believe that's your
[19:56] new birth
[19:59] I believe those are the
[20:02] manifestation of what has taken place
[20:04] with inside of
[20:06] you I I believe a baby comes into the
[20:08] world it's a baby and it
[20:12] cries but that's a part of the baby that
[20:16] you know is working it's something
[20:19] within you I believe in all kind of
[20:21] things that happens when people receive
[20:24] the new birth and all kind of
[20:26] experiences as far as that but remember
[20:29] now the
[20:31] experience has got to be a Biblical
[20:34] experience which would be meaning that
[20:37] the experience would have to be the same
[20:39] for everyone right or we would be trying
[20:43] to find what kind of experience we
[20:46] need so then we can't put it on shouting
[20:49] crying speaking in tongue seeing Vision
[20:52] seeing Angels believeing the prophet's
[20:54] message
[20:59] we can only put it on the revelation of
[21:01] Jesus Christ personally to
[21:06] you there your new birth see all
[21:13] right so when a man lives by
[21:16] faith and walks by faith perfect Faith
[21:19] the prop I mean substance Faith he's
[21:22] isolated from the entire world and
[21:24] becomes a new
[21:25] creature in Christ now you you're
[21:28] getting into bride
[21:32] material
[21:34] what when you're isolated when you're
[21:36] set aside when you you've done all the
[21:39] things and come to that new
[21:43] birth but does everybody understand what
[21:45] I mean by see we want to say uh you must
[21:49] be born again and this one person will
[21:51] say well I done this and I was born
[21:54] again this other person say I done this
[21:56] and I was born again no the the baby
[22:00] comes the
[22:02] same I mean they may have to do cyrian
[22:05] and and all but we're talking about
[22:07] normal
[22:09] babies normal babies are all born the
[22:12] same right
[22:15] right all right then what they do in
[22:19] those things is different things right
[22:22] do you say I cried when I received the
[22:24] Holy Ghost the crying wasn't the Holy
[22:26] Ghost right it's the supposed to be
[22:30] because you received it amen right amen
[22:35] all right see then you're saved by grace
[22:38] what through
[22:42] faith through a revelation
[22:46] amen where that it's revealed to you
[22:49] that you're born
[22:50] again but it's never been re revealed to
[22:53] you well no I just cried and i' started
[22:55] going to church and I've becoming good
[22:58] well
[22:59] all
[23:01] right you remember the story of the man
[23:03] that you know read the track went and
[23:05] done this that the other went to
[23:07] different churches finally went to
[23:08] Brother Brandon brother brand said you
[23:10] you received it right back there he said
[23:12] you mean I had it all the time yeah but
[23:14] he didn't understand he had
[23:18] it and then there brother R speaks of
[23:21] his daughter-in-law think her name Lo
[23:24] that received the Holy Ghost one night
[23:26] and was doubting the next night
[23:29] all
[23:30] right see then if you put it on anything
[23:33] other
[23:35] than the revealed word of God what what
[23:40] what anchor do you
[23:43] have what bases can you put it
[23:46] on outside of the revealed
[23:49] word now I didn't say what you think I'm
[23:54] saying and all you do is just read the
[23:56] word and you're saved right
[23:58] I didn't say that that's
[24:01] right I said you can't be saved without
[24:04] a
[24:06] revelation that's what your Prophet
[24:10] said you can't be healed without a
[24:13] revelation well I just walked alone I
[24:15] just healed well that was the
[24:22] Revelation something took
[24:24] place all
[24:26] right but you see
[24:29] we think it's some kind of
[24:32] a makeup
[24:34] something we think the new birth is some
[24:37] kind of a an emotional
[24:40] feeling well why don't you just believe
[24:43] it's speaking in
[24:45] tongues well we we don't believe that
[24:47] anymore well what do you believe well
[24:49] now it's
[24:51] shouting well somebody come along beat
[24:53] that in a while no it's crying
[25:00] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:03] personally to you I think it's 45 Christ
[25:06] M your God
[25:10] revealed and see that and that alone is
[25:13] the new
[25:15] birth you're
[25:17] only trying to put it upon some
[25:20] fleshly point or
[25:23] thought or
[25:27] idea when when it's a
[25:29] revelation all
[25:32] right and look what your Prophet said
[25:34] let's go ahead and pick up number 11
[25:36] because I love this quote we will start
[25:38] here on it because we done way with all
[25:40] the ones in between and just scan along
[25:43] this is uh perfect Faith
[25:47] 1963 and we see at first the disciples
[25:49] didn't have this perfect
[25:51] Faith they didn't have
[25:54] it because they'd had Christ walking
[25:58] with him you
[26:00] know all right but then afterwards
[26:03] Christ was in
[26:04] them see and you see it's hard to have
[26:08] this perfect faith without the Holy
[26:10] Spirit it has to bring
[26:13] it all
[26:14] right
[26:18] now they had the Lord Jesus walking with
[26:22] them right they seen the sick healed y
[26:25] the dead raised
[26:28] the great signs and
[26:30] wonders and they said they
[26:33] believed but not a one of them had
[26:36] Christ Living in
[26:38] them
[26:40] until Jesus Christ came back on the day
[26:42] of
[26:43] Pentecost all
[26:45] right we get on to that and we stay on
[26:48] that a lot because see that's what
[26:49] people do and if you can tear that down
[26:53] on the basis that that uh you know the
[26:56] Old Testament Saints had the new birth
[26:59] well you realize how You' destroy the
[27:01] entire Bible because you would only have
[27:03] it just in mental believing
[27:07] right whatever you would want to call it
[27:09] speaking in tongues shouting crying
[27:11] believing the message whatever you want
[27:13] to call it you would just be going up on
[27:15] that basis and you wouldn't see the
[27:17] difference between the old and the New
[27:22] Testament but you can't call Jesus the
[27:24] Christ without it being the new birth
[27:26] amen and the new birth never came until
[27:29] the day of
[27:30] Pentecost all
[27:32] right so then it was revealed to
[27:38] them see we looking at the upper room as
[27:41] people sitting with tongues of Fire
[27:43] coming down Lighting on them and then we
[27:46] see them going out and speaking in
[27:47] tongues and we see things
[27:50] happening but that was because the birth
[27:53] had already
[27:56] come see we want to make that to
[28:02] Birth come on right right we want to
[28:05] make that to birth we want something to
[28:09] do with it right when you don't have
[28:12] anything to do with a new birth other
[28:14] genic than accepting
[28:17] it
[28:19] right but you see if we put it on
[28:22] anything why wouldn't we want to put it
[28:24] on seeing like they did where it would
[28:28] talk of licks of fire sitting on each
[28:33] one but
[28:35] remember the birth is what you're
[28:37] talking
[28:39] about
[28:42] now you getting to the bases of the
[28:45] scriptures that we
[28:46] read in
[28:49] Matthew all right getting down to
[28:52] something that you can anchor
[28:54] into you remember the prophet explaining
[28:57] that they were set in the upper room and
[28:59] some of them finally come around and
[29:00] said hey let's just take it by faith
[29:03] we've seen the sick healed we've seen
[29:05] the dead raised we've had a Ministry
[29:07] we've done these things let's just take
[29:10] it by faith and go
[29:12] out and somebody says now wait a
[29:15] minute I'm still a little bit
[29:18] scared you said well that's not in the
[29:20] Bible no but that's pretty well explains
[29:23] it because somebody wasn't in an
[29:26] agreement with the rest of them
[29:30] right somebody said we got to wait what
[29:33] he
[29:34] said well they didn't know what was
[29:37] going to happen but they knew what they
[29:40] had was not able to bring forth at that
[29:46] time now what about
[29:50] it is what we have enough
[29:58] right will it stand a
[30:07] test only if it's
[30:10] quickened they had a pretty good
[30:12] foundation that they could walk out on
[30:13] didn't they they had a Ministry they've
[30:16] seen all kind of thing Happ in their
[30:22] Ministry but yet when that Holy Ghost
[30:24] came in that new
[30:26] birth they walked out of
[30:31] there they wanted to go
[30:34] out and die necessary whatever it
[30:38] was because they'd experienced
[30:42] something but I keep coming back to that
[30:45] to you and I because that's the
[30:47] purpose do we have something that will
[30:49] hold us you remember the brother Rand
[30:52] said during the time of your wife dying
[30:54] and the things happening your daughter
[30:57] said did you uh keep your religion he
[31:00] said no that it kept
[31:03] me all right do we have something that
[31:07] will hold
[31:11] us see the new birth is a
[31:19] revelation you said Brother D I've never
[31:22] thought about the New Birth being a
[31:24] revelation well why not because that's
[31:26] the way the prophet taught it
[31:30] what would it be then what would be your
[31:32] new
[31:34] birth well I was just a sinner I was out
[31:37] in the world and I come to church and
[31:40] they preached a sermon and I got under
[31:41] conviction I got down and prayed and I
[31:43] cried and and I got up and I went home
[31:45] and I quit drinking and smoking and
[31:47] running around with women and and I
[31:49] started going to
[31:53] church well you could do every bit of
[31:55] that and still be lost that's right
[31:59] sure
[32:02] right so you could do every B of that
[32:04] and still be
[32:06] lost I want
[32:08] something that I can anchor into yes
[32:13] sir I I want something
[32:16] powerful and where was it where brother
[32:18] R said I believe it's in perfect Faith
[32:22] he said let's get God's Adam
[32:26] Bomb now what did he say that
[32:29] was
[32:32] faith and you know what within my hand I
[32:37] have within the confines of my hand
[32:39] you'd say
[32:42] it enough of whatever they go through
[32:45] and make it to blow the world to Smither
[32:49] rings but I can't see it I can't smell
[32:51] it I can't hear it taste it or nothing
[32:59] right but he said let's get God's Adam
[33:01] Bomb
[33:04] Faith because see faith is something
[33:07] that you can't show it to nobody
[33:11] else if you want to base it upon a good
[33:14] life if you want to base it upon the
[33:16] things like that and all of those things
[33:18] goes with it right but if that's all you
[33:21] can Bas it on what about the condo
[33:23] priest
[33:27] according to our thinking the condo
[33:29] priest had more right to call it saying
[33:31] that he was God than Jesus did and Jesus
[33:34] platted a rope and run them out of the
[33:39] temple
[33:41] right see church I'm trying to get you
[33:43] and I to just sit down and think you
[33:45] know just
[33:47] think do I have the
[33:53] goods or is this just been a go to
[33:56] church thing
[33:58] yeah we was going to church before we
[34:02] ever heard of the
[34:07] prophet and some of you was more
[34:10] dedicated before you ever heard the
[34:11] prophet your
[34:12] now
[34:18] so all
[34:20] right but
[34:24] listen the
[34:26] church is
[34:29] built upon
[34:31] on
[34:32] Revelation
[34:34] right
[34:36] right was that the scripture we
[34:39] read and Upon This
[34:42] Rock This Revelation I'll build my
[34:47] church and now like I said while ago if
[34:50] his church ain't fully completed yet
[34:52] he's still building amen thank you Lord
[34:56] amen
[34:58] all right we're going to get down here
[34:59] in a little
[35:00] bit a couple of quotes on down to where
[35:04] you'll come back to what we've been
[35:06] talking
[35:07] about you and I coming to a positive
[35:10] attitude about what we are and where
[35:13] we're
[35:14] at but I want you to think about
[35:20] it what is the church or you know if the
[35:25] church is built upon Revelation what is
[35:27] it buil
[35:30] upon you
[35:32] know go ahead with number 12
[35:36] brother this is from the patmas
[35:41] vision and how marvelous the
[35:46] Revelation remember now remember you
[35:50] cannot get it through theologians it
[35:52] doesn't come that way it only comes as a
[35:55] revelation water baptism used in the
[35:58] name of Jesus Christ can only be given
[36:00] as Revelation
[36:02] amen Jesus and God being the same person
[36:05] can only come as a
[36:08] revelation the whole Bible is built on
[36:11] Revelation the whole church is built
[36:14] upon Revelation he gives Matthew 17 we
[36:16] know it's 16 for I set Upon This Rock
[36:20] the supernatural
[36:22] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[36:24] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[36:26] Supernatural Revel
[36:30] ation a
[36:32] revelation the church is buil up a
[36:37] revelation it's built on a substance
[36:42] am it's built on faith look at the next
[36:45] one works is Faith Express
[36:47] 1965 now Faith is a revelation from God
[36:51] now Faith is a revelation there's where
[36:54] I want to stay there just a moment it's
[36:56] a revelation
[36:58] he has revealed to you by his
[37:01] grace is nothing you did you didn't work
[37:05] yourself up into
[37:07] Faith you ever have faith it's give to
[37:10] you by the grace of God right
[37:13] amen and God reveals it to you therefore
[37:16] faith is a revelation and the whole
[37:19] church is built upon the
[37:25] Revelation now
[37:27] build upon a
[37:31] revelation and we know that it's buil
[37:33] upon the revelation of who God
[37:35] is it's not built upon the revelation of
[37:38] who we are right it's built on the
[37:41] Revelation how many do you need of those
[37:44] it's built on a revelation of Jesus
[37:46] Christ amen personally to
[37:50] you all right now in doing that then
[37:55] look at the next one we just try to do a
[37:56] few of them to time but works as Faith
[37:59] Express this is paragraph
[38:01] 1 06 that was 105 we were
[38:06] on excuse
[38:09] me
[38:11] uh the whole church is built up on
[38:14] Revelation let me get it down the works
[38:16] of Faith Express where he says about the
[38:18] Baptist preacher that was the last that
[38:21] was the last one all right is up on it
[38:23] that's the reason I say him because it
[38:25] paragraph 105 then down to 106 the
[38:27] Baptist Minister told me not long ago
[38:29] said I just can't accept
[38:32] Revelation said then you cannot accept
[38:34] the Bible you cannot accept Christ
[38:38] because he is the revelation of God he
[38:41] God revealed in flesh therefore the
[38:43] whole church is built upon divine
[38:48] revelation if you can't receive
[38:50] Revelation
[38:52] then all right so now what they do in
[38:54] the message form of people brother
[38:57] brandham had the Revelation I got the
[39:00] Revelation that brother brandham had the
[39:02] Revelation well now you better be
[39:05] careful because you could come up with a
[39:06] secondary secondhand
[39:08] Revelation I want something personal to
[39:12] me you
[39:13] know all right which came and I agree
[39:16] with all of it that it comes by hearing
[39:19] the word of the Lord and comes by The
[39:21] Prophet's message being revealed to you
[39:24] and I
[39:28] but now I want you to think for just a
[39:30] moment this is my
[39:32] point if the church is built upon
[39:35] Revelation was half the church built on
[39:38] Revelation you
[39:41] know or or was it
[39:44] all and then you'll see why we Hammer so
[39:47] much that Martin Luther one day said the
[39:50] judge shall live by faith
[39:53] right that was the message of that age
[39:57] and you realize then he the body would
[39:59] not have been complete had that age not
[40:03] taken
[40:05] place are you with
[40:07] me well we go back to it's build upon
[40:10] the apostles and
[40:13] Prophets You
[40:16] know oh the church is built on the and
[40:20] it
[40:21] is but remember Luther's justification
[40:25] of the truth was was a part of the
[40:28] disciples
[40:29] message Wesley sanctification the truth
[40:33] was built upon the apostles and Prophets
[40:35] of what they taught and the isusa
[40:39] street
[40:41] genuine was built
[40:43] upon what the apostles
[40:47] taught
[40:49] right but get what I'm talking about it
[40:52] had cut off and went into the ground
[40:54] back there and had to come back
[40:58] and look what a great Gap you would
[41:01] have if you only took the apostles and
[41:03] their Doctrine and then you jump over to
[41:06] the end time to where the Prophet
[41:09] came you realize how big of a gap you
[41:12] would be dealing
[41:16] with but see that wouldn't be buil in
[41:18] the church so if you don't get nothing
[41:21] from the message tonight
[41:22] remember the whole church is built upon
[41:26] revelation
[41:28] right all
[41:30] right but now here's where we are where
[41:33] we
[41:37] started is this whole thing just built
[41:40] upon brother randam was a
[41:46] prophet you remember what we talk they
[41:50] didn't have no trouble with Martin
[41:51] Luther until the church begin to make
[41:56] manifest what Luther was talking about
[41:59] and then they got lost a lot of members
[42:02] all
[42:03] right but you see just because a man
[42:05] brings us the
[42:07] message that don't put an end to All
[42:10] Things somebody's got to make the
[42:11] message
[42:12] alive your Prophet said the bride was to
[42:15] vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[42:18] Revelations 10:7 do you need that
[42:21] quote he said she was to
[42:24] Vindicated BL God it's already been
[42:28] Vindicated well you're just lost
[42:33] out go ahead and shout all you want
[42:37] to but what about
[42:40] it what about a church being built upon
[42:44] Revelation go to number 14 let's get to
[42:46] this
[42:48] one things that are to be 1965
[42:53] 1205 you see the whole whole program the
[42:57] whole church is built upon divine
[42:59] revelation Jesus said in St Matthew the
[43:02] 16th chapter Flesh Blood has not
[43:04] revealed this to you but my Father which
[43:07] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[43:10] what is it a
[43:13] revelation of who he was
[43:17] right and Upon This Rock This revelation
[43:20] of who he was I'll build my church and
[43:24] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[43:26] it
[43:28] so if we believe that the seed died and
[43:30] went into the ground had it not come
[43:33] back in
[43:36] Luther you wouldn't have an original
[43:38] seed in the last
[43:41] days right so what did he say Upon This
[43:45] Rock I'll build my church and the gates
[43:47] of hell can't Prevail the revelation of
[43:49] Jesus Christ in this
[43:55] hour not what what he was in another
[44:00] hour what he was now the Bible Express
[44:05] it's growing in the bride to the full
[44:09] stature all
[44:12] right then if the church is built upon
[44:17] Revelation and the Revelation is the
[44:19] revelation of Jesus
[44:22] Christ but it's where he's at and what
[44:25] he's doing
[44:27] is building the
[44:31] church see we look back there and think
[44:33] the church was built back
[44:38] there you
[44:40] know come on is that the way you're
[44:41] thinking
[44:42] was until somebody like me comes along
[44:45] and jogs you just a little bit makes you
[44:47] think a
[44:49] little when you say the church is buil
[44:51] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:53] that's day of Pentecost this what they
[44:56] come for
[44:58] you don't have a complete body that's
[45:01] right you don't have a complete Church
[45:03] in the book of
[45:07] Acts and even though as I said we built
[45:09] on the foundation Apostles and
[45:12] Prophets Luther never added anything to
[45:15] the
[45:19] word but that part of the body could not
[45:21] come into being had Luther not preached
[45:25] the just shall live by faith
[45:28] and God revealed that to a group of
[45:33] people it wouldn't work to just stay
[45:35] back
[45:36] there well we believe what the disciples
[45:40] say I I used to say that when I thought
[45:43] there was three Gods what did you
[45:48] say
[45:52] right I used to say the Bible says
[45:56] father son and the Holy
[45:58] Ghost how many of
[46:00] you used to think
[46:04] that
[46:05] right we thought we had the
[46:11] Bible just as I said we thought on the
[46:14] day of Pentecost that that was all of
[46:17] the building of the body that there
[46:19] was that was just the
[46:23] feat the foundation
[46:28] now are you following me then go through
[46:31] the church
[46:34] ages and read those Church
[46:38] ages just the the the writings in
[46:41] Revelation 2 and 3 and see what was
[46:44] given to each
[46:48] church
[46:50] right you know what that was doing that
[46:53] was the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[46:54] that age
[46:57] being made
[46:59] known and building a
[47:02] body a
[47:09] church look where we'd be to just take
[47:11] that idea well there all back there
[47:13] heard that he built a church on death
[47:16] Pentecost no he just built the
[47:22] feat so each age has a part of the word
[47:26] of God
[47:27] to be made known and that's
[47:30] building the body the church the
[47:36] bride and look where we'd be without
[47:38] what they
[47:39] said
[47:43] am look where we'd be without what
[47:45] Martin Luther taught of the just shall
[47:47] live by
[47:51] faith are are you following me are you
[47:54] following me what I'm talking about some
[47:57] personal to you so what part of the body
[48:01] are
[48:03] you what part of the body is this age to
[48:07] bring
[48:10] forth
[48:13] right come
[48:16] on I thought the eyes was this age in
[48:20] the
[48:24] prophetic right
[48:27] right is that the way it goes but then I
[48:30] thought there was a part beyond that
[48:33] that the prophet spoke of called the
[48:42] intelligence in the Capstone you have
[48:45] many things that's why there there so
[48:47] much mistaught about the the Capstone
[48:50] cuz even in the Capstone you you have to
[48:52] even deal with the zeusa street
[48:54] Pentecost if you really want to get into
[48:55] the Capstone maybe someday I'll get back
[48:58] to that thought and
[48:59] do no it's just the end time down
[49:04] here uh in the anatomy of the
[49:07] body uh the lips is in the head the last
[49:12] time is his brother uh used to say last
[49:16] time I checked the lips was in the
[49:21] head and then the eyes
[49:24] came and then the intelligence
[49:29] comes we see there somebody got to make
[49:32] manifest a part of that age for it to be
[49:35] able to be part of the body of Christ
[49:37] and to build the body of
[49:43] Christ so then we look back and we see
[49:46] that Luther did have a
[49:48] part Wesley had a part ausa Street had a
[49:54] part the prophet had a part
[49:58] but somebody has got to make full
[50:00] manifestation in the last
[50:03] days for us to walk off the
[50:06] earth all
[50:09] right the Church of the Living God is
[50:12] built upon divine
[50:14] revelation not upon denomination
[50:17] organization not upon Creeds or
[50:21] doctrines but on spiritual revealed
[50:25] truth of the Living
[50:28] God in to tment
[50:32] 1957 it's not built
[50:36] upon any denomination organization
[50:39] Creeds or
[50:42] doctrines it's built upon a spiritual
[50:46] Revelation
[50:48] now the last time I checked this out it
[50:51] was right that uh you know you start out
[50:54] with a baby and it first thing is what
[50:57] is the the little Wiggly things the
[51:00] spine and then it grows and develops
[51:03] into parts and things but you know where
[51:06] it all comes
[51:07] from and you know it all has the same
[51:11] blood
[51:12] type uh your foot is not one blood type
[51:15] and your arm another blood type and and
[51:18] this that and the other it's all the
[51:20] same right the baby comes from one egg
[51:25] being multiplied by The Germ connecting
[51:28] right starts with a spine then from
[51:30] there gross parts of the
[51:32] body in other words what I'm saying is
[51:36] then the things that Martin Luther
[51:39] taught of the the Trinity is not in the
[51:42] word of
[51:46] God when he said the Jews ought to be
[51:49] taken out and killed because they
[51:51] crucified Christ that's not in the word
[51:53] of God
[51:59] but when he taught to just shall live by
[52:01] faith
[52:05] amen that was in the word of
[52:07] God part of the word of God part of the
[52:10] body of
[52:12] God that fit exactly the same DNA from
[52:16] that just shall live by faith up here
[52:18] with with Luther is exactly the same DNA
[52:23] of built upon a foundation Apostles and
[52:25] Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief
[52:31] Cornerstone are you are you following me
[52:35] right we talk about a
[52:41] revelation we talk about faith being a
[52:48] revelation but you know one Revelation
[52:50] cannot be contrary to another
[52:54] Revelation that's right
[52:59] right you
[53:01] agree Luther's just shall live by faith
[53:03] couldn't be contrary to the
[53:06] disciples and brother randam took those
[53:09] things and preached on them and he said
[53:12] they was a mysterious part of
[53:14] justification a mysterious part of
[53:16] sanctification and a mysterious part of
[53:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's in
[53:20] the seal book that in the lifetime this
[53:23] age that's Prophet was to pick those
[53:26] things up
[53:29] see brother random never come to bring a
[53:31] different Doctrine than Luther did of
[53:33] the just shall live by
[53:36] faith come
[53:39] on you know how the body built so much
[53:42] of this and so much of that what did
[53:43] what the prophet say said it's not so
[53:45] much of a dog sale so much of a cat sale
[53:48] so much of it no it's human sales all
[53:51] the way to make the human being if not
[53:55] we would be running around with a head
[53:57] like a horse and a body like a man or
[54:00] what is those mythology things that they
[54:03] used to
[54:04] have see that wouldn't quite work
[54:13] out Philadelphian Church age he
[54:16] says I'm going to say something now look
[54:20] his entire church is built upon divine
[54:24] revelation of
[54:31] himself so we get a revelation that's
[54:34] contrary to what the prophet
[54:37] brought you know right real quick where
[54:39] we're
[54:43] at and it's like I say to you which is I
[54:46] know it but it gets a point to go into
[54:48] people's head everybody saying brother
[54:51] Brown's wrong here and brother Brown's
[54:52] wrong there but there's certain things
[54:55] that bud they word to you that he's
[54:57] right about especially marriage and
[55:03] divorce
[55:04] right well you know if he's wrong over
[55:07] here and wrong over there then he's
[55:08] wrong marriage and
[55:10] divorce I don't mind saying it that way
[55:13] I didn't say what we misunderstood him
[55:15] as saying I said if he was
[55:21] wrong if he was wrong when he preached
[55:23] the seals then he wouldn't right that's
[55:29] sensible all
[55:31] right but Dev build upon divine
[55:35] revelation and wisdom versus Faith he
[55:38] says it like
[55:40] this how is a man through wisdom going
[55:43] to understand it when the whole Bible
[55:45] and the whole Church of God is built
[55:48] upon divine
[55:50] revelation by faith
[55:56] a
[56:00] revelation now remember what we've been
[56:02] talking about healing and salvation
[56:05] Etc you can only be healed by
[56:09] Revelation you can only be saved by
[56:14] Revelation and that's where people don't
[56:16] get their healing is because they don't
[56:18] know how to pray for a
[56:20] revelation have you ever asked God to
[56:23] reveal to you
[56:26] that you was
[56:27] healed I mean seriously ask
[56:31] him Lord give me a revelation that I'm
[56:34] Healed then I'll life at them
[56:38] doctors but see we want to life at the
[56:40] doctor that's go I ain't going them
[56:41] doctors about two weeks from now I
[56:43] Mighty I might try one a couple weeks
[56:45] now if it don't work you done lost
[56:48] it
[56:50] me it's to build upon divine revelation
[56:58] what's the next One
[57:00] Thirst to know him is life the person
[57:03] Christ
[57:06] himself not comparing it's a revelation
[57:09] that God built his church
[57:12] upon and if you don't build upon that
[57:15] same church listen the Bible said Able
[57:18] by
[57:20] faith and faith is a divine revelation
[57:23] see faith is a divine revelation all
[57:27] this whole thing is built upon the
[57:29] Revelation then and unless it's revealed
[57:32] to
[57:37] you this got to be revealed to us church
[57:40] it's not something that we
[57:44] just have hazardously go
[57:49] along be serious about your healing
[57:57] see we're good to quote but what do we
[57:59] do with
[58:02] it Prophet says God Wants You healed
[58:06] more than you want
[58:08] healed well you know where the problem
[58:10] must
[58:11] be you know it must be in
[58:16] me I I can't blame
[58:20] him but then we want to profit up by
[58:24] saying maybe it ain't his
[58:28] time well that may be
[58:32] true but are we doubting
[58:38] it see if it's Revelation you won't
[58:40] doubt
[58:44] right you life it's a
[58:47] doctr if it's a
[58:49] revelation and then Revelation you
[58:51] better do what he
[58:53] says right
[58:58] but if it's a revelation if God is
[58:59] revealed to
[59:04] you but you see I've got one in here
[59:07] somewhere maybe I can find it after a
[59:08] while that it's what I've always tried
[59:11] to get you to look at that we
[59:15] say if I'm totally delivered I have a
[59:19] faith a
[59:22] revelation no that's a scientific fact
[59:26] that ain't a revelation that's a
[59:28] scientific fact you progress Beyond
[59:31] Revelation it's
[59:33] scientific so then we won't we don't
[59:35] want to just put it on the basis that
[59:39] well you let me get better and I'll tell
[59:40] everybody I'm better but until then I
[59:43] don't want to
[59:45] lie I don't want to lie about it
[59:50] now well you're a liar if you won't say
[59:52] What God Says
[59:57] and see to be healed in you got to say
[59:59] by Stripes I'm
[1:00:04] Healed and you may have to confess that
[1:00:06] for quite a while before it becomes
[1:00:10] a spiritual Revelation amen
[1:00:15] right now there's your 25 years with the
[1:00:18] Abraham and the waiting to the thing
[1:00:20] it's all
[1:00:22] right because it does work that way
[1:00:26] but if it's revealed to
[1:00:32] you you'll just call the world up what
[1:00:34] brother brother say he said if God told
[1:00:36] me to go raise George Washington or was
[1:00:39] there Abraham Lincoln or something he
[1:00:41] said I'd just call all the press and
[1:00:43] tell them to be there in the
[1:00:47] morning yeah but that's just a prophet
[1:00:50] now
[1:00:53] well I listened to it tape in the truck
[1:00:57] a lot of times when I'm writing in the
[1:00:59] church AE series and some sometimes
[1:01:02] going bring
[1:01:05] that and in that brother brandom's
[1:01:07] talking
[1:01:08] about
[1:01:12] Faith
[1:01:15] Deliverance and things see we've got to
[1:01:19] say we're healed when we have no
[1:01:23] physical manifestation that's right and
[1:01:26] then stay with
[1:01:33] it you get
[1:01:36] sicker what did the prophet
[1:01:38] say the greatest sign you are healed is
[1:01:43] for you to get
[1:01:48] sicker
[1:01:51] right it's not God's fault
[1:01:56] you know
[1:01:58] it see it's our fault for not believing
[1:02:01] and keep confessing until he can make it
[1:02:03] manifest right right now get my point of
[1:02:07] what I'm talking about would it be
[1:02:08] saving salvation healing you start out
[1:02:12] confessing and God says they're
[1:02:15] healed let's use salvation God says
[1:02:18] you're saved you you come up to
[1:02:20] justification you repent of your sins
[1:02:22] you get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ following the word of God
[1:02:26] you try to go to church you start lining
[1:02:27] up and and doing better and all like
[1:02:30] that and your confession is that you're
[1:02:34] a
[1:02:35] Christian and God says they're a
[1:02:39] Christian now he knows the end of the
[1:02:41] road but he doesn't hold that against us
[1:02:43] right
[1:02:45] right and he
[1:02:47] says they're confessing it I'll confess
[1:02:53] it all right that's as long as you keep
[1:02:57] that positive
[1:02:58] confession you keep walking right on
[1:03:01] through your
[1:03:03] salvation but then somebody come along
[1:03:05] and try to talk you into a Doctrine or
[1:03:08] an idea what you need to do you need to
[1:03:10] speak in tongues you need to shout you
[1:03:13] need to cry you need to do this that and
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:17] other and then you go around telling
[1:03:19] everybody said what I'm doing now is I'm
[1:03:22] confessing I'm saved and I'm going to
[1:03:24] start
[1:03:27] doing all these other things well it
[1:03:29] might be good but just
[1:03:33] remember you're off of your original
[1:03:36] Foundation that says you're
[1:03:40] saved because salvation has nothing to
[1:03:43] do with your dos or
[1:03:46] don'ts oh there's where we don't like
[1:03:49] that
[1:03:50] one we think that we've got to do this
[1:03:53] or we got to do that I'm glad that I
[1:03:56] didn't do like brother so and so cuz he
[1:03:58] would have never saved
[1:04:04] me start your
[1:04:07] confession and then confess your way
[1:04:09] into
[1:04:11] it is that what brother R told who was
[1:04:14] John Ry the one that's blind or whatever
[1:04:15] it was go say
[1:04:19] it I was looking at him today where that
[1:04:22] he told about I think it's
[1:04:24] in super s where he told about that boy
[1:04:28] saying he was
[1:04:31] healed and a bunch of
[1:04:34] preachers got on to him about it and
[1:04:38] said you're hindering the
[1:04:40] cause quit going around telling
[1:04:43] everybody you're healed bunch of
[1:04:49] preachers you know what the one thing he
[1:04:54] said he said don't take away from me the
[1:04:57] only thing that I've
[1:05:01] got he said if you was in my shoes yeah
[1:05:05] in other words what would you do
[1:05:07] right don't take away from me the only
[1:05:10] thing I've got which was what a man's
[1:05:12] word that he was healed God's Bible
[1:05:15] saying he was
[1:05:16] healed you know them preachers was
[1:05:18] trying to take away the Revelation from
[1:05:21] the man that he was
[1:05:23] healed and you know what there he was
[1:05:26] healed right
[1:05:27] then but boy just can't you see them old
[1:05:31] preachers we straightened him
[1:05:34] out we got him straight down and God
[1:05:37] healed
[1:05:40] him job's
[1:05:45] comforters we got him we got his mind in
[1:05:47] the right Channel and God come down and
[1:05:50] healed
[1:05:53] him when they were the devil in
[1:05:59] himself
[1:06:01] right their words
[1:06:05] were but you see
[1:06:10] Church a revelation is something that
[1:06:13] you
[1:06:15] have and you can't show it to somebody
[1:06:18] else you can tell them what happened to
[1:06:21] you you can tell them the experience you
[1:06:23] had with it you can tell them the thing
[1:06:25] that you scripturally you went through
[1:06:27] and the experiences you've had or what
[1:06:29] you've seen or what you've done you can
[1:06:32] you can tell people about
[1:06:34] it but until that person has a
[1:06:37] revelation they don't know what you're
[1:06:39] talking about
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:45] right cuz you see a
[1:06:50] revelation a
[1:06:52] substance now I had these notes so now
[1:06:54] I'm fixing it jump over on another part
[1:06:56] of the message CU I want to get these
[1:06:58] two out of the way where I can continue
[1:07:01] Wednesday and then next week from Sunday
[1:07:05] on to what I was studying
[1:07:08] on you know that
[1:07:12] uh a
[1:07:14] revelation is a
[1:07:19] substance it's not a
[1:07:22] myth it's not a thought number 15 if you
[1:07:25] want to pull it up
[1:07:29] running it's not a
[1:07:32] hope he's talking about faith it's a
[1:07:34] substance things hope
[1:07:36] for it's not a
[1:07:39] wish it's a
[1:07:42] substance it's actually
[1:07:45] something that you
[1:07:52] possess yeah
[1:07:55] you possess
[1:07:57] it it's to you and you only because
[1:08:01] we're
[1:08:03] individuals it's not a collective thing
[1:08:06] that we talk
[1:08:09] about but it's a substance you have is
[1:08:12] it
[1:08:16] actually something that you
[1:08:21] possess or is it just a mental
[1:08:23] confession
[1:08:29] now he said it's not a
[1:08:31] myth it's not a
[1:08:35] thought it's not a
[1:08:38] hope it's not a
[1:08:40] wish it's a
[1:08:42] substance something you
[1:08:47] possess now substance is what anything
[1:08:50] consist of whether natural spiritual
[1:08:52] right and we know as we brought in the
[1:08:55] basis of tonight's message that the word
[1:08:58] of God is the thing that brings all
[1:09:01] things into being right worlds were
[1:09:04] framed made created brought into being
[1:09:07] by the word of God right all right now
[1:09:10] see then the healing that we
[1:09:14] need has to be
[1:09:16] spoken
[1:09:21] amen come
[1:09:23] on salvation
[1:09:26] has to be
[1:09:28] spoken by
[1:09:32] youen God's done done his
[1:09:36] part you believe in your
[1:09:39] heart you confess with your
[1:09:42] mouth remember what Bob was talking
[1:09:44] about that person talking about I don't
[1:09:46] want nobody to know what I believe
[1:09:48] because it might be dangerous one
[1:09:51] day then they don't have anything I
[1:09:54] don't care if that's somebody sitting in
[1:09:56] this building cuz he was kind of
[1:09:57] reluctant about saying it so if it is
[1:09:59] somebody sitting in this building you
[1:10:01] just remember what I'm saying okay all
[1:10:07] right but you
[1:10:09] see it's something you possess amen it's
[1:10:17] yours but you've got to say
[1:10:22] it right right you you got to speak it
[1:10:28] right because he makes intercession upon
[1:10:33] your profession is that right we say
[1:10:36] confession because it's really
[1:10:37] profession it's confession same word but
[1:10:41] he makes it upon what you
[1:10:44] say well I don't know whether I'm Healed
[1:10:47] or not well God says you know what they
[1:10:49] don't know whether they're healed or
[1:10:51] not he's just saying what you say
[1:11:00] right but when you can really
[1:11:06] say I have the
[1:11:11] substance I have the a possession look
[1:11:14] at the next one having faith in
[1:11:19] God some think that it's a mental
[1:11:22] conception of the word but that's not
[1:11:27] right faith is not a
[1:11:29] myth faith is a substance things hope
[1:11:32] for the evidence to have an Evidence it
[1:11:34] must be a substance you remember that
[1:11:37] quote might got to be a substance so
[1:11:40] it's not just something that you imagine
[1:11:42] in your
[1:11:44] mind it's something that absolutely you
[1:11:49] have it's something that you possess in
[1:11:53] your own being
[1:11:57] and what is it it's the evidence of
[1:11:59] things that you have hoped for it's the
[1:12:01] evidence of things that you do not have
[1:12:04] as
[1:12:05] yet okay but you have the authority of
[1:12:09] God to say that you have
[1:12:13] it it's an Evidence something you have
[1:12:16] in your
[1:12:18] heart now it's not something that you
[1:12:20] just kindly push yourself
[1:12:24] to I've noticed so much of that in my
[1:12:26] meetings that people try to work
[1:12:28] themselves up into something to make
[1:12:30] them believe now you can't do that
[1:12:33] you're just beating the iron but faith
[1:12:35] is something that's just as calm and
[1:12:39] settle as it can
[1:12:44] be I can call her scream amen right
[1:12:47] there because the times that I've been
[1:12:50] healed and delivered and all it wasn't a
[1:12:52] great emotional this workup or that
[1:12:54] workup or great feelings it was
[1:12:58] just it's
[1:13:03] finished it's
[1:13:06] finished all right you ever had it take
[1:13:10] away settled as this can be he taking
[1:13:12] God as his word and having the Assurance
[1:13:14] in your heart that God is able to keep
[1:13:16] what he has said that he would do and
[1:13:19] will perform everything that he said he
[1:13:21] would do confess it let me get in a
[1:13:24] hurry
[1:13:25] something that you
[1:13:27] possess remember it's not an
[1:13:29] intellectual conception of something
[1:13:31] it's a substance it's something that you
[1:13:33] possess let me read these five perfect
[1:13:35] Faith uh paragraph 33 that's something
[1:13:38] that you possess not imagination if you
[1:13:41] really have it it's just as real to you
[1:13:44] as any other thing that could
[1:13:51] be are you reading it it's just as real
[1:13:55] as you know that that you're riding an
[1:13:59] automobile it's just as real as you know
[1:14:01] that you're sitting in the church it's
[1:14:03] just as real as you hear my voice it's a
[1:14:05] substance not an imagination not an
[1:14:08] emotion but something you have and it
[1:14:11] comes to you by hearing the word of God
[1:14:13] and that only faith comes by hearing and
[1:14:17] hearing the word of God that puts it
[1:14:19] back to where your faith then is is not
[1:14:23] in some individual
[1:14:25] it's not in a man it's not in a
[1:14:28] organization it's not in a group of
[1:14:31] people it's in God because God is the
[1:14:36] word see your faith is in God faith
[1:14:38] comes by
[1:14:39] hearing the word of God then when God by
[1:14:43] his word not by what somebody else did
[1:14:46] somebody else said but by what God's
[1:14:49] word said he said let every man's word
[1:14:52] be a lie and mine be a truth amen right
[1:14:57] think about
[1:14:59] it something you actually
[1:15:05] possess look at this one faith is a
[1:15:07] substance and friends when you pass by I
[1:15:09] know they have enough Faith to cure a
[1:15:13] toothache that's right and some of them
[1:15:15] coming through with cancer and say I
[1:15:18] have faith to be healed that do not have
[1:15:20] faith my scripture lesson tonight said
[1:15:23] faith is the substance of things hope
[1:15:24] far the evidence of Things Not Seen see
[1:15:27] it's a substance it's something
[1:15:30] direct something that you really
[1:15:33] have not something that you imagine
[1:15:36] something that you think you have but
[1:15:39] it's some direct positive act that you
[1:15:42] have you see what I mean going to the
[1:15:45] next
[1:15:47] one that was he 19 he1 roll up or the
[1:15:52] young fell in the
[1:15:53] wheelchair now watch it he's talking
[1:15:56] about what you can do when you got faith
[1:15:58] now watch what he says about the man in
[1:16:00] the wheelchair you can Rejoice just as
[1:16:02] much When Faith takes a
[1:16:05] hole saying that you have it as you
[1:16:07] could be if you were running up and down
[1:16:09] this AIS just like you was out of the
[1:16:12] wheelchair see it's the substance of
[1:16:14] things hope far the evidence of things
[1:16:15] not seen you don't have to feel nothing
[1:16:18] you don't have to taste nothing only
[1:16:20] thing you have to do is to believe
[1:16:22] something and it becomes a positive
[1:16:25] something that you
[1:16:27] possess that is your faith
[1:16:31] right you cannot accept it by
[1:16:33] intellectual thought that's intellectual
[1:16:36] your minds will reason but Faith does
[1:16:37] not reason if you got intellectual Faith
[1:16:40] then that's just a reasoning faith
[1:16:42] you'll say well if
[1:16:45] I only was
[1:16:47] healed I could get up you see what I
[1:16:50] said want to go we say when I'm Healed
[1:16:54] I'm say I'm heal
[1:16:56] heal I'll say it
[1:16:59] then you know I say it everybody knows
[1:17:03] it we sure a man sitting there and he
[1:17:05] gets something takes off something took
[1:17:07] place you know have to explain
[1:17:11] it now your mind your faith does
[1:17:15] it and you say if I was only he if if I
[1:17:18] only was healed I could get up if I only
[1:17:22] was healed this lump would leave if I
[1:17:25] only was healed I'd feel better if I
[1:17:28] only was healed the doctor would tell me
[1:17:30] so but when you've got faith all the
[1:17:33] doctors in the world could never tell
[1:17:35] you anything different you possess that
[1:17:39] it's the substance of things hope for
[1:17:41] the evidence of things not
[1:17:46] seen what is
[1:17:48] it it's an actual
[1:17:51] substance something you possess
[1:17:56] why because it's been revealed to
[1:17:59] you
[1:18:00] okay salvation's been revealed to you
[1:18:04] right healing has been revealed to
[1:18:08] you see he builds his church upon the
[1:18:12] revelation of his
[1:18:17] word and he's still building that's
[1:18:22] righten until that last one comes in
[1:18:25] he's still building and you know what he
[1:18:28] ain't ask us how to do
[1:18:32] it he just does
[1:18:35] it but he's revealing
[1:18:38] it every person that was ever born again
[1:18:42] was born again the same way that's one
[1:18:45] thing we don't like
[1:18:48] right
[1:18:50] right right yes CU we got it all figured
[1:18:55] out how I done it and other people
[1:18:56] didn't do it and I got it cuz I done
[1:19:01] it I thought ever baby came water
[1:19:07] blood
[1:19:11] baby right that's what I
[1:19:14] thought well I thought every Born Again
[1:19:16] believer according
[1:19:19] to uh John if I if I get it wrong the
[1:19:22] scripture but anyhow where it says when
[1:19:24] Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born
[1:19:26] again you must be born to water and
[1:19:30] spirit I thought he was explaining the
[1:19:32] new
[1:19:34] birth of what would have to take place
[1:19:36] to every Born Again
[1:19:42] person see the birth is the
[1:19:46] same the sensations is what's
[1:19:53] different right
[1:19:56] you know I don't mean this wrong I've
[1:19:59] always said it that it's try to be
[1:20:00] truthful brother R said one time he
[1:20:03] said where you're born again at has a
[1:20:06] lot to do with
[1:20:08] you he said if you're born in a great an
[1:20:11] emotional situation you'll be
[1:20:13] emotional if you're born again where
[1:20:15] it's just kind of quiet and I was born
[1:20:17] again under brother Mo you know he
[1:20:20] didn't give my new
[1:20:21] birth but he was our preaching or
[1:20:23] whatever that night
[1:20:26] and I guess that's just the way I am I'm
[1:20:28] just
[1:20:31] settled and I don't have to have all of
[1:20:33] the
[1:20:37] emotions I don't have to get up every
[1:20:39] day and say Lord would you let me feel
[1:20:42] good today and shout and
[1:20:46] cry would you let me be
[1:20:49] happy I told my wife the other day I the
[1:20:52] greatest sermons I've preached
[1:20:55] I the way I count it the greatest
[1:20:57] sermons I've preached in the past 5
[1:21:00] years that I've ever preached in my life
[1:21:03] the depth and the thoughts and
[1:21:07] understanding but yet most of my time I
[1:21:09] feel like I'm
[1:21:15] backslid not that I'm out doing wrong
[1:21:17] don't get the idea
[1:21:20] okay it's just that I'm not made to be
[1:21:23] emotional up built and things and I
[1:21:26] don't have to have
[1:21:28] it you know I don't have to be told
[1:21:31] every day that I'm a
[1:21:33] Dale to for me to believe
[1:21:37] that that was solved a long time ago you
[1:21:44] know I don't have to have
[1:21:47] feelings and things but yet I love
[1:21:52] them and don't you ever think that this
[1:21:54] man doesn't believe in feelings and
[1:21:56] signs and wonders I've told you my
[1:21:59] experiences in my life and you know
[1:22:02] it I've seen things that most people
[1:22:04] have never seen I've felt the presence
[1:22:07] of the Lord that most people have never
[1:22:09] felt but yet I don't have to have
[1:22:14] that I've always told you I could come
[1:22:17] to this church and not have one note for
[1:22:20] a
[1:22:23] sermon but yet on I'm not all
[1:22:28] nervous what am I going to preach I
[1:22:30] don't know what am I going to
[1:22:31] preach I just got a lot of confidence in
[1:22:35] the God that I
[1:22:37] serve that he'll give me something you
[1:22:40] know what he's never failed me yet so I
[1:22:42] ain't never worried about
[1:22:45] it but you see we build everything on
[1:22:47] emotions and feelings and things instead
[1:22:51] of it being on the word of God
[1:22:56] but brother Dale you don't know you you
[1:22:59] don't understand me I'm not against
[1:23:02] emotions I believe in
[1:23:05] emotions I believe anything that's got
[1:23:08] life to it going to have some emotions
[1:23:11] but yours is different from
[1:23:14] mine
[1:23:17] right see I'm not a what you call a
[1:23:20] prayer Warrior come on Brothers I'm not
[1:23:23] what you call a prayer Warrior Warrior
[1:23:24] I'm
[1:23:26] sorry there's people that are prayer
[1:23:30] warriors that they can pray we used to
[1:23:33] together and I've told you many times
[1:23:34] brother Tatum and brother George and
[1:23:37] brother Mike Canada and then we used to
[1:23:39] get together and they they could just
[1:23:41] pray and just pray and just pray and it
[1:23:44] wouldn't nothing to be an hour for them
[1:23:46] to just be praying and I'm over there
[1:23:49] sitting reading my
[1:23:52] Bible because I've done prayed
[1:23:57] I I've done said what I wanted to
[1:23:59] say and there was no need of me saying
[1:24:02] anymore so I just get my Bible sit down
[1:24:05] and start
[1:24:09] reading but you say well you just wasn't
[1:24:13] emotional
[1:24:18] okay but I've had God to answer a few
[1:24:21] prayers that I've asked him
[1:24:26] and I'm sorry that I'm not see prayer
[1:24:28] warriors are like who was the man oh I
[1:24:31] get their name wrong but moody or one to
[1:24:33] of them that he went into a town where
[1:24:35] who was the one that would go through
[1:24:37] town and the factories would just shut
[1:24:39] down and and this things would happen
[1:24:41] one of the Great Men back there and you
[1:24:44] know what he would do he'd find a bridge
[1:24:47] going into town he'd find a prayer
[1:24:50] Warrior he' put him under that bridge
[1:24:54] and said you stay there and
[1:24:56] pray don't come to the surfice stay
[1:24:59] under the bridge and
[1:25:02] pray see when people cross that bridge
[1:25:05] is already under the anointing of the
[1:25:07] Holy
[1:25:10] Ghost there's people that are prior
[1:25:12] Warriors
[1:25:13] that that's their
[1:25:16] calling mine is just to be sit
[1:25:20] down this is
[1:25:22] it and if there this is not it let me
[1:25:25] keep this until that gets here cuz I'm
[1:25:28] happy like I
[1:25:33] am because I believe it's the
[1:25:35] word faith is a
[1:25:42] revelation we're going to talk next
[1:25:44] about a sense of
[1:25:49] Faith a sense of
[1:25:52] Faith then when we're going to talk
[1:25:54] about faith being the six
[1:25:58] sense then we're going to play a
[1:26:03] tape we're going to play a tape for
[1:26:05] brother

[1:26:13] believe the word is

[1:26:54] I'll
[1:27:16] giveus
[1:27:21] world you heard our brother and been
[1:27:23] request that he
[1:27:25] ask Lord there a serious matter there
[1:27:29] about problems and
[1:27:31] things but we just believe
[1:27:34] you you said the biggest portion of it
[1:27:37] was finished when our brother got up and
[1:27:38] walked up here to ask us to pray with
[1:27:40] him so we believe you we send a prayer
[1:27:42] call just as a contact to be between us
[1:27:46] we believe your
[1:27:47] word by your
[1:27:50] stripes
[1:27:52] Lord by your life by your
[1:27:54] doings all will be made possible for
[1:27:58] whatever we have need of in Jesus
[1:28:03] name just believe
[1:28:09] it you have a need come and let's
[1:28:12] believe but if you ever had God to just
[1:28:14] say something to you just in your inner
[1:28:20] being just hading to speak to you
[1:28:28] and in that you can just say Thank you
[1:28:31] lord always wondered about
[1:28:34] that now it's
[1:28:39] settled didn't break the world down blow
[1:28:41] it all up did it just speaking to us but
[1:28:46] then we got to go I hope you followed my
[1:28:48] line we've got to speak it

[1:28:58] healed you got to say that you're
[1:29:02] saved you have needed something speak

[1:29:23] and I hope this come that right we ask
[1:29:25] and that's
[1:29:26] good but sometimes he wants us to say
[1:29:33] it so D he wants us to say
[1:29:41] it go speak
[1:29:44] it go speak it when it's going totally
[1:29:52] contrary it's going totally contrary to
[1:29:54] what you
[1:29:58] thinking you say it

[1:30:05] propping up something or trying to make
[1:30:07] something work up
[1:30:09] or
[1:30:11] no that doesn't work anyway but when you
[1:30:14] get down
[1:30:17] serious and you get to
[1:30:20] thinking
[1:30:22] Lord I have a
[1:30:27] need you don't come on the scene I don't

[1:30:47] something up enough to get you to build
[1:30:49] up Faith to practice and practice
[1:30:51] there's no such thing
[1:30:55] but we're getting in the way that we
[1:30:57] won't just speak it and walk forward but
