Aaron that was like right over there not the one that was here this weekend he did a wonderful job I sure did he he he enlightened a lot of things that I've been studying on and U and brought the word the way the way I knew he would he's just he's just a good brother we sure do appreciate him remember yes remember next Saturday night if you don't have a cell phone spring forward we're going to Daylight Savings Time next Saturday night so yeah so spring forward and then the next time we'll fall backwards there in October or November so um we're springing forward have more Daylight that will be next Saturday night also remember brother Joel Brown will be here in a couple of weeks and then remember also that uh the gun safety course will be on the 16th that will be Sunday after the first service and if you want to come put your name down it will be downstairs in the I call it the common room the big room downstairs and there will be gun safety and then later on we'll go down to my house and to the shooting range and you can learn how to shoot a a pistol or a rifle so uh man is a good friend of ours Mike Queen he's a certified instructor and he was well happy to come he said I'll be there so it's going to be at 3:00 on the 16 that'll be the same weekend brother Joel Brown will be here but that means there we'll have a lot here so that's okay but we'll have that it'll be safe downstairs don't worry uh there won't be any bullets but there will be some Firearms he can show us how they work and all that get that out of the way and then when we go down to the to the shooting range we'll do that very safely and if any young person is under the age of 16 you must have a parent or somebody not just somebody you say is there somebody with you the whole time cuz just for safety concerns okay everybody with me 16 or younger you got to have somebody there with you that is an adult that will be responsible for you okay just to keep everything safe all right so you love the Lord amen we're going to continue on with that what we were talking on Sunday written in our heart or the heart means the soul it's the very soul of you it's very it's what it's the very fiber of your being it's what you are you are a soul you just got here by a body BR Mom and Daddy brought you here but God give you a soul and then you have to determine you have to determine where that Soul goes now we know by predestination God knew by for knowledge who would and who would not so you still have a choice amen but the very seed of God is God and when you come to that then you you are a part of God and the word of God is written in your heart not in a sinner's heart it's written in your heart cuz you know we're going to speak a little bit this morning about a mystery there was a mystery that began in the Book of Genesis that we're going to see the Fulfillment of that right here we are the people who the ends of the world have come upon let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for today thank you for the people Lord that's here Lord let us all hear from you today Father let it not be just the words of Mind Lord but Lord you know we've been thinking about this for the since Wednesday night with our brother Lord and we we're not I don't think we're catching that who we really are and the prophet of God told us that if the bride will realize who she is and what she's doing here that she'll be an invincible Army Satan won't know what to do with us if we create create a world that he don't know anything about and that's in our heart because Lord when you gave us a birth we got a soul but Lord when you gave us a new birth you didn't take that one out you cleaned that one up the unclean Spirit was gone out of the soul of person and you came and inhabited so Satan can never inhabit that again but we know that he can inhabit the spirit of man and he can beat on this flesh father we realize that and know that and if we know how to handle that Lord I think we'll do a lot better Lord be with the ones that are sick the ones that have come and told us that they were sick and going to be watching in different ones Lord I pray that you'd be with them touch their body forgive us of our faults and failures Lord thank you for the day that we're living in thank you for the word that we have and I pray that you'll anoint it at this moment Lord for the people and all of us say amen amen God bless you first Corinthians but it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that Agape him not felo him that Agape him that love him with no restraint that love him with all their heart regardless of circumstances regardless if you're on your back in a hospital come on somebody we're a group of people who have to believe something we've never seen and then realize that it's right here it's not a way off it's right here it's something that we can that we have already inside of us that we can pull from that resource all right we'll get to that just a minute but God hath revealed them unto who Us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the reading the word I'll finish reading this and get to my point for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received now watch Paul says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god now we were born with an adamic adamic Adam the old Adam nature you were born with a nature contrary to God everybody with me all right then by the new birth God comes in and burns that old nature out of you and puts himself inside all right so that's the new birth that's the spirit of God now we have receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know why why were we given the spirit of God to know the things of God to know how to handle things even if we have heartaches and trials and troubles we know how to handle them or we know how to go to the scripture and the scripture talks back to us and helps us handle those things everybody with me so that we might know the things that are what freely given to us of God there is no restraint with what God can give us except what we restrain ourself everybody with me all right we're our worst enemy you're our own we are Our Own Worst Enemy okay well just pray for me then 2 Corinthians 3:2 says ye are our our epistle this is where we was talking about last Sunday written in our hearts now there's not a there's not an ink pen and God's inside of your heart and he's writing stuff no listen you're the very fiber of what has been written amen you're the very makeup of what this Bible is it flows not through your veins as your natural blood but through the spirit that's in you that's now the spirit of God somebody say Amen it's the spirit of God that flows through you now uh I have blood that's regular human blood Jesus had regular blood now it wasn't human blood it was but it was God's blood we know that but brother R said it wasn't the blood that Sav it's the life that's what saved you the blood keeps you clean you keep looking back and that blood keeps covering us everybody with me all right it's the life it's the life that's inside of you that's worth more than 10,000 worlds as as brother randam said but you are written our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men written means to engrave or inscribe or record now I like that word record there's a recording brother B said it starts when you come to the age of accountability there is a there is a recorder started and it records you until you get born again then when you get born again that's erased praise God that's where it goes It goes in the sea of God forgiveness he can't remember your past sins if he does he can judge you amen if you receive Christ in your heart today and he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're just as Eternal as God is you're just as perfect as God is we just don't understand that cuz we have all that Spirit realm and Satan beating on us say no you're not you did this you did that you did this you did that I told you many times the Sea of God's forgetfulness he put a place that he can't even go to yes sir and that's where my sins went amen that's why I tell you many many times that when we when we uh testify be careful don't bring back old stuff right that's gone that's right right that's gone don't bring back old stuff testify what's God doing to you now everybody with me so he's engraved if we're engraved in the palm of his hand then he's engraved in our heart yes and there's no way when you get the new birth there's no way he can erase that Absolut praise God for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ what is an epistle it's send one a message because these are Epistles that go that John wrote us Corinthians Ephesians all the different ones God wrote through Paul he gave us Epistles something written down but remember Paul said the letter kth right remember that the letter will kill you we was talking to brother Dutch last night we went eat with them and and sister uh April and if we keep just reading the letter it will kill you that's why I said this it's got to be written in your heart not written on a piece of paper now you got to read the piece of paper because we're human beings I just reading a quote back there where brother R said Jesus was the fullness of the godhead B amen he was the word and what he spoke is in here amen now what you speak as a human is not in here but what he spoke is in here everybody with me amen all right now where is he at today by the Holy Ghost he's inside of you now that don't do away with you having to not read the word anymore don't get to that point please don't don't get to that point where you say I got it all no he was the fullness of the godhead bodily you are a part of it not all of it right some of you male some female some pastors some evangelists some prophets some teachers but everybody in Collective together makes the body of Christ and what does he work through I'm going to read it in a little bit he said I am the vine you are the branches now remember the vine doesn't bear fruit but it has the life that goes to the branches and that's where the fruit is that's where you and I are yes we're not the vine we're part of the Vine Vine cuz Jesus told us he said now if you're not of me he said you're cut off and cast into fire in other words you're going to the day of judgment and you're not going to make it to heaven but you and I by the new birth we are already sitting in Heavenly places written Epistles yes we do have to study we do have to read the Bible but you don't have to go to the Bible every second to live your life with me you don't have to carry this with you everywhere you go it would be nice but it would be absolutely I'm sorry it would be cumbersome they have to carry this thing around I remember when we were in school we were in home e yeah they had it back in the 70 anyway we actually cooked and ovens and all that stuff you know it wasn't even a microwave back then I don't think but the teacher there she said all right all you girls and guys I want you to go bring me a five gallon I mean a 5B bag of flour so we all went and bought 5B bag of flour she says okay she said I want you to carry that every day if I see you in the hallway you need to have that 5B bag of flour the point she's trying to make is was especially to the girls was that's a baby and you got 5 lbs of a baby you got to haul around and take care of make sure it don't fall fall and bust make sure all these but it was a good point that's the same way with this we don't have to carry this around it should be written in your heart and you should listen you should be able to if somebody says something you should be able to at least remember something about a scripture that you read in the Bible that relates to that come on that's written Epistles that's the letters that Paul wrote to the Corinthians but it wasn't just to the Corinthians it was to us it still is to us so now look written not with ink all right so the letter kth that's why we were talking about last night you you can read you can read quotes and you can tear the message apart give me a quote like brother Dale said give me a quote he said just give me a little while he said I'll find one that sounds contrary to that by the written word amen right but that's not the continuity of God God's not in confusion that's right so whatever comes out of the word of God has got to what it's got to Ping with it every time that's right every time it's got to be right there with it every single time that's why God had to send us a prophet and we believe he was a prophet for the end time we believe that we had to get it through him because we were confused all of us the denominations were confused so even brother random comes and he gives us 1100 sermons we have all the books downstairs we got books in our library and we got books all over the place everybody with me don't even have them anymore you got them on your phone I mean on your watch and your phone right they quit printing books you know that right there's no printing press in Jeffersonville anymore they quit printing It's All Digital now so you can have it in a moment in an instant you can have it anywhere you want to your computer or anywhere you can pull up a quote but we can't be a bunch of quote quoters people have stood right here in this Pulpit at fellowship or ministers meeting and quoted brother brandham and it totally be contrary to what we're talking about in the fellowship in the ministers meeting right brother Aaron read a quote absolutely and they have declare their Doctrine by that quote and it seemed contrary to what we were talking about the subject matter right same book same Prophet I want you to think that's good that you're quiet you need to think about this I have pretty much I know Dad does he had all 1100 sermons in book form CU he got them from Brother David mamus and different ones he just got this huge library right and they're and and they're they're written in so many times till you can't hardly read it but he could but see that was the part that we had to go through everybody with me everybody had you've got to go through that part where that this means more to you and you you know God don't mind if you Mark Mark the Bible up a little bit that kind of proves that you've readed a little bit when everything starts falling apart God don't God don't mind that but what have you done with what's on that paper it's the whole mystery that we're going to talk about in just a few minutes the whole mystery is is how you can produce what's on that page and not have to carry that Bible with you everybody with me you've got that's Christianity in the message is that you live what you've been taught and you can live it to the tea now Jesus he never missed it a day did he he never missed it an hour they never caught him wrong amen never so if that Ministry is what brother Brandon brought to us which is the ministry of the son of man then we should be able to bring it to you pure and unadulterated okay you that's impossible well you become an unbeliever cuz I believe it I believe the fullness of the godhead bodily is in the bride we're going to read it here a little bit later on and she is fulfilling what Jesus did and said 2,000 years ago right here on Earth today all right because of the opening of the furtherment of the word because of the unwritten part that brother randam told about looking inside the pyramid because of the opening of the seals you and I are in a place that no one has ever been before I hath not seen and ear hath not heard nor entered into the heart of man what God in other words what God's got for us not going to bring us he's already brought it right if we just believe what's already brought that'll take us to a body change not in tables of stone that's where they wrote that's what they wrote on some back then but in fleshly tables of the heart you're going to send a message to the world Listen the world wants to know where God is now they might have a different God I heard a preacher a couple days ago and he wasn't a message preacher he said you know he said Buddha Buddha Buddha's final words cuz there's Buddhist right there there's a a sect or a religion called Buddhism all right Buddha final words recorded by the people that were with him was I have not done everything I want to do and then he died so he died incomplete so they have an incomplete word Muhammad died his body is laying in the grave and they know that but praise God y we have a man that sat one day on a cross and he said it is finished and we don't go visit a tomb where there's a horse and a man waiting on him to get up we serve a Risen Lord that's inside of our hearts written in our heart thank God for this religion we have I think Dutch was telling us last night and maybe some of y'all that work with AI they plugged in Christianity and they plugged in Buddhism they plugged in Jehovah Witness they plugged in all the different not Jehovah yeah and they plugged in all the different denominations Christianity came out on top just by artificial intelligence that everything fit more than the others fit everybody with me just Common Man by a computer when they put all the information in brother John Buddhism missed that because he didn't complete everything [Music] letter that he actually wrote cuz listen Jesus stood one day and he said thank you Father he thanked the heavenly father that he spoke in a way nobody would understand him but just a few people and you and I are that few people continue on Paul says not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life because remember let just say it this way if you continue with re just the letter of the message and letter of the Bible you can't live it you can't live it there's no way you can live it that's got to come off the page inside of you that's why brother R had to come to straighten the things out like no eternal hell who in the world preached that there was a body change for Abraham and Sarah it was plainly in the Bible but nobody knew that God through a prophet gave us what the unwritten word and you know what now that is in your heart because when we say Abraham and Sarah you immediately would think in your mind they took a body change but now you tell that to a Baptist and they look at you cross-eyed yeah they never heard of that never heard of something like that before that's because we have the message of the hour the unwritten part sure we have 1100 sermons but I've told you many times before if we don't get the essence of this message you missed it cuz you can like I said you can read where brother Brown and you know what Jesus was telling them right here they said oh Moses gave a writing of divorcement and and and so and so and so and so and Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning that's right he said in other words if we' have stayed with that we're all dead he said but because of the hardness of your heart heart he said in other words I'll give you a Grace amen praise God for that same thing with everything Christianity can you live that Bible no but you can if you get the essence of it we know that we live a daily life but we also know that we have a Rudder or a a TI poost that we can go to that will move us to where we need to go where we need to be right so we have a spiritual Rudder that tells us which way to go and listen if we start down a road that we're not supposed to be on come on somebody you pray for me if you start down a road that you shouldn't be going down something stops you that's God oh my well you blah blah blah you want to if it wasn't for the grace of God you'd all be dead you'd all be dead in your sins and trespasses and some of you would already be be dead physically I say some of y'all I mean me included I appreciate you um your confidence to have me one more year so it's all of us folks it ain't just one it's all of us never is going to be one person no they I I was telling somebody the other day I said if you preach the gospel that's good but you got to deal with people as individuals even when dad always said he said remember he said I'm preaching to your soul he's not preaching to your personality brother Dell told us years and years ago he said I'm looking and preaching at your soul he said God has given me enough in other words the anointing of of discernment not to discern that oh Regina you in the you in the liquor store yesterday she might have been she was talking to somebody I hope help me say Amen thank you okay thought I used the wrong person sometimes you know they say that a Baptist will talk to you except if you're in the liquor store with them so anyway but Matthew 11:25 let's continue on but thank you very much I appreciate it just if you uh if you have any concerns just speak with me I would appreciate it and uh and we'll get through this thing May maybe I love you all but God has G did give a pastor enough discernment not to know like I said exactly like what brother randam had but I'm going to read to you in just a few minutes that discernment message that he brought Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart that's what broke loose into the bride that the word can do that not just me saying and you responding that's what brother BR was now see he would look at him say now you were yesterday you were the hospital the guy had on glasses I mean he was just so vivid you know but we don't have to be that now we have to be where we can see as an overview and you can see people that struggle it's like brother Dell always said he said if you're happy let your face show it amen if you're not that's right amen oh at that time Jesus answered and said at that time I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudence and this listen Jesus said and we should be aware that this is the way it's going to be this is the way it's going to be cuz Jesus said you have hid these things what these things these mysteries from everybody but babes right that's what he said right there you can read it and has revealed them now what is revealed something previously hid has been opened up and made known all right something previously hid that's been opened up and you can see what's going on we for many many years we saw what happened in the garden they told us it was an apple they told us it was a pomegranate they told us it was some kind of fruit but now listen you don't have to go back to the Bible here's your written part you don't if you have a revelation of what happened in the garden you don't have to go back and verbatim read that cuz you know the essence of what happened Amen brother Ram had to he had to preach it but you and I I mean do we need to preach what happened in the garden do we anybody I mean honestly if what happened in the garden you don't get that then that's Genesis that's the beginning of everything all right and you ought to know by now after you get a little bit age on you you know that's the problem anyway praise the Lord so now it's the unwritten part you have a revelation from God that's in the Bible but now it's in your heart and listen can anybody take that away from you brother Dell always said you can get them in with a hun dog somebody get them out with a hamburger in other words what is it somebody got them in with this but got them out with that if you ever get a revelation no one can get you out the devil can't get you out he sealed out of your soul I want us to understand that let our soul that's what I said many many times ago let that thing start working we've bound it so many years you say oh no I don't brother R said that the Holy Spirit has been bound by Creeds and dogmas for 2,000 years amen but it's now been loosed on an end time bride that's loose in other words yeah there's 200,000,000 demons they're out there we swept a lot of them coming to church today everybody with me but there's more and we'll just defeat them too sir God give us the grace to do it but what do that do it puts you closer to God it should when you realize God came and gave something to you personally God I mean I'm talking about God the master of the universe any of y'all go outside and see those seven star seven planets line up oh you missed it that's an event that didn't won't happen for hundreds and more years all in the southwest Sky there was seven seven seven seven planets lined up remember God said brother Bown said something will happen and God will prove it and you know that February the 28th is when that happened that was just a couple days ago that when the cloud came down in Arizona and gave what gave us a sign yeah that Christ is here now he's not over the sea Matthew 13:1 he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you now look you who's he talking to talking to his disciples it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven so here we go there's a requirement it's given unto you to know the Mysteries but to them it's not given have you ever talk to somebody about a doctrine that you that we that you know we we've all done it if you've been anywhere and anybody's been around any kind of person that's religious sometimes they'll say something and you'll make a comment and they've never heard that before right that's but to you you didn't have to go back and get a book you didn't have to go get a a a quote book you didn't even have to get the Bible amen you ought to be able to just boom run right through water baptism right I did that one time not too long ago and uh there was some people sting in the congregation that that didn't believe that and uh I told him I said there's your Bible I said pick your Bible up and read it I said if you can find anybody's ever been baptized in the titles father son holy ghost in the Bible I said you know how brother Brown said that he said I'll put a false prophet you know I'll put a sign on my back and you ought to see the people here they go they go they're trying to find it Well they never found it like like Aaron said ain't there in good old southern English it ain't there sir but do they believe it I don't know but to us it's just when it's like Mom said one time mom said when I saw water baptism I think it was Mom or somebody said and i' never seen you know name name now you can go back to Genesis and you see in my name in my name in my name the whole family of God is in my name the cast out devils in my name be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost my name is in them name you've never seen that before but if you got something in you that's responding to it you'll search and when you search God's got it here I want us to realize when God wrote this Bible he wrote it knowing the day that you would sit down and have get a revelation that that's exactly what it was and he was so happy didn't matter if he had to write it through an Old Testament Saint Old Testament Prophet New Testament Prophet didn't matter who he wrote it through but it was for me and you yes sir those prophets Jesus told us those prophets would love to see their word be made manifest in a group of people they never saw it before today it is spoken and it is written Epistles you and I yes and they read you every day amen I read you like [Music] a you can hide a lot but you get to know somebody and know their actions and they this and that and the other yeah you pretty much got cuz you can't hide not in this age this is the age of Revelation everything's coming out all the things are coming out everything's being revealed Romans 16:25 now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel the preaching of Jesus Christ and the preaching according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began I hope some of y'all are praying if you're not your asleep I'm just going to believe you're praying which was kept now this is this is Romans this is Paul getting a revelation from God to bring it to me and you this is the way I see the whole Bible I see it's written Paul Paul grabbed it Paul grabbed the mind of God and he wrote that physically wrote These are letters yes right that was written on pieces of paper to the Romans but not only to the Romans to be you yes sir to the Gentiles he said according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began now if it kept if it's kept secret since the world began we need to go back to Genesis and find out what that mystery is Right amen that's what that's what Jesus said right or Paul said we know it was God writing it we know it was Jesus but now it's made manifest now Paul has grabbed it and brought it down to his time to his day but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets remember there was no new testament he was writing it right then he went to the Old Testament and got what he's writing today or then but it's now made manifest and by the scriptures of the prop prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith First Corinthians now all these things now watch all all means all all these things happened unto them New Old Testament because this is Paul writing all right everybody with me amen for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come now that was Paul 194 something years ago right I think we might be just a little bit closer than that today so he's not not only written it to them because they're in the grave he's written it to you because we're alive right right what was this great Secret he said since the world began there's a mystery that God has kept in his mind before the foundation of the world but it's getting ready to make that word made manifest so if you want to I can quote it you can go to Genesis 1:26 now listen God had created all animal life world water plants animals he standing there one day and he said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them multiply let them have dominion now listen that scripture was not known cuz a commentary commentaries that I've read from people that are not in the message that was all mankind they they say that was every person that was Adolf Hitler that was you know whoever that was just God made this made man right cuz remember man was made on the sixth day right but they don't understand the great mystery is that if there had not been a fall only the bride would have come forth only God's children or his progyny or his own DNA is in that right there right and then he took brother randam a prophet to come he said now that was not all man right in other words that was a special class of people right made them in theophany he goes through the whole thing tells how that then Adam was put in flesh and God put that spirit inside of Adam and then he was supposed to be the listen to me the mystery Giver right amen he was supposed to be able to explain that mystery CU he had the mind of God there W no preachers around to muddle him up it was him and God Amen but we know what happened so there's no way that that could come to pass immediately but it's going to come to pass because God spoke it right now you read Genesis 126 in the beginning then God made male and female created he them you understand all that got it right let them have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul the and that's what Adam had until the fall happened and that cut that off the Genesis 126 man had to be had to go back into a mystery in other words the book was closed right no one in the Old Testament could even Proclaim Moses may have had a little idea of what was going on but he didn't have the revelation of the mystery right even though the great Moses talked to God lift the ear God held that right there right he held that and he spoke it Moses wrote it down but you and I see this right here is to the who the ends of the world have come upon God brought the mystery before the foundation of the world listen this genesis6 man was not made on the six day right hello come on wake up on the sixth day no that was man that was when God put that into somebody that come up out of the ground and put that into Adam this one never had a beginning this never had an end they never had a beginning but God had to bring it to a point to where he said let us make man in our own image it was a mystery what's he talking about listen folks Satan was standing there when that happened this was created oh come on this was created in the mind of God before the foundational World Satan had no idea who this is he had no idea this is a secret God help from eternity this was already this was before Satan yes this was before the devil he created you in His image and hid you in a mystery a great mystery that only a prophet in the end time could reopen this book by the Holy Ghost by the what son of man Ministry because in Luke they handed Jesus a scroll well they really rejoiced about that in Honduras when we had the ministers meeting they' hadd never seen that before remember in Luke when Jesus sat down in front of all the religious people of the world at the time he was in a temple they handed him a scroll and it was closed he sat down he opened the book and went right to the spot and identified who he was but remember when he gave it back to him he didn't leave it open that's right he closed it back read your scripture he closed it back and handed it to them as a closed book right amen that's right he did that for a purpose he did that to keep it sealed so that the religious world would not know even who he was cuz he declared listen if you ever watch the the the series Chosen Jesus was pretty much a calm guy until remember this scene go back and watch this scene cuz he's sitting in the temple they hand him the scroll he open opens it and he looks at him and he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me and he made it so real till it was and afterwards then that's when they started throwing him out of the temple they started calling him belb they started they started really unraveling you know and Jesus said it's going to get rough it's going to get rough after this when you when when God unveils himself in me and you it's going to get rough it even got rough when he birthed you into his body amen if it was flowery bed of EAS pray for me I got the wrong one it got worse lost friends persecuted by family not my side but Jim's side everybody with me hard to get to church right Amy struggle in a fight to do the things of God how many you get up in the morning and before you even go in to the bathroom you open the Bible start reading I didn't think so pretty clothes ain't good enough only in horses shoes and hang grenades see what I mean that's not what we do we don't do that because we are human but that Genesis 126 man during the day somewhere will call your attention Lord come on he'll call your attention to something every day of your life yeah every day of your life if you're a real Christian walking in the word of God something Sparks your either Sparks your Revelation or Sparks you to go to a scripture or Sparks you to speak one are singing that's a Christian Life is able to be able to do that every single day oh yeah when you got a headache when you don't want to that's my point right that's what I said about that when you get up out of bed you you you want to go right in there and start preaching no you got to get up you got to get them as brother rown said get the matter out of your eyes right brush your teeth maybe put your teeth in the rest of us but we do all these things and then the word of God comes prevalent in our life we read our Bible in the morning or do whatever but somewhere during that day even if you don't do it in the morning sometime during the day something's going to come to you that's the unwritten part that's why I say you don't have to carry this around with you all the time sisters I'm talking to you too you should know enough to tell people why you dress the way you dressed and why you act the way you act without having to say brother R said cuz brother R didn't come to give us and preach to us Holiness it was already in the Bible people had forgot to preach it right misinterpreted theology is what killed the people so the greatest secret mystery is that God is going to dwell in a human being yes he's going to dwell in human flesh he's going to be prevalent in human flesh come on hallelujah we're he's going to be the center of our being absolutely right listen to this when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed The Works that I do shall you do also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I send to you Elijah the prophet now watch what he's he's setting up watch behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers that was his first part of his ministry he knew that because the Seal's already broke now he knew what the second part was and and in there what in that first part of the ministry will come a new ministry that we've been talking about it'll come a new ministry and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church right have preeminent in this church am oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people people bride yes that Genesis 126 man has multiplied and it's replenishing the Earth and it will come to a day that we'll in other words we'll have dominion over this Earth First that we're coming back in the Millennium and have a dominion over this earth physical amen but we got to have it over this one first everybody with me oh my the anointed man now the anointed people oh my what to do to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom now look the bridegrooms already anointed he is the anointing yes sir but it's got to transfer onto into the bride right everybody with me anointed by why why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam which was what you'll not surely die you'll catch the knot you'll catch the part the devil's trying to tell you and you'll say I don't want that anymore Eve accepted it and then Adam accepted what Eve did all right everybody with me now listen the second Adam and the second Eve is not going to fall because why the second Eve is going to say that ain't nothing but the truth and God is going to be so prevalent in our life that you can't tell the two apart come on somebody same scripture that speaks of the what bridegroom speaks of the Bride she is him yes it took a prophet to break the airwaves to tell us that's who we are we're him in another form called a bride and that's what he wants and he's so happy with that why can't we be happy with why can't we be raising our hands and and being freedom to be able to worship god listen you worship him through the word first amen right you worship him through the word first but there should be an anointing come that they can't nobody keep their hand down for you able to raise your hand and say oh thank God I am free free free from this world of sin I've been washed in the blood amen he said my word is spirit so take it off of this page and put it inside of you that's what he wants that's what he has ordained before the foundation of the world that Genesis 126 man is not separate from God it's the same God in another form called a bride the same person if not oh oh for a second person we're the devil amen there's only one God there's only one bride that's so full of the groom till you can't tell the two apart what he turned down he comes back and we accept it yes John 15:4 abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine so you got to be connected to the right Vine that's where the life comes from it's root vine branch our root trunk Branch every way you want to say it because there's no fruit on that tree apple tree in the trunk but there's but but potentially there is that's where that life comes out that's can you imagine you look at God and you wonder how God does things things well just look at nature you plant one apple seed one there's not interjected any other seed get this there's not interjected any other seed but in that one seed when I planted those apple trees 20 something years ago there's been hundreds of thousands of apples come out of that one little bitty seed talk about the multiplication of God just at nature you plant corn you plant one corn you get 7 or 800 corn ears two ears to a stalk sometimes three if you're lucky and then you plant each one of them and they bring forth 800 to a th000 you plant them 800 and each one of them brings four that's the multiplication of God that's when God said let us make man in our image I you I'm not going to fail these people are not going to fail they're going to be me because I declared them to be me I'm going to tell you today you are the Bride of Jesus Christ which is God in another form called a bride the fullness of the godhead B is not in brother Michael that was Jesus whatever we got in here today you're a collection of that abide in me and I in you as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except to divide abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me this is red letter so I put it in red letter I am the vine you are the branches don't interject yourself and say you're the vine no you out of your place right I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit Genesis 1:26 said be fruitful be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing without me you can do nothing without Jesus Christ you can't do this you're right you can't do this but if you'll let him live through you amen now remember Brother D preached many many years ago about the Book of Revelations and he told us he said that's the bride's book right some of you weren't here but he preached many Ser he preached a big long series on the Book of Revelations and he said that's the bride's book why we're the only people to understand it it's written to us for us and to be revealed listen to us and through US amen not just to us but through us now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now listen the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it's the revelation of his future work in the oncoming seven Church ages what is that bride he's now moved into bride form and that's how he's revealing or giving Revelation is to the bride do you believe that am then I'm going to read this one more time because I I I believe it and until we get to where we can can live it we need to keep reading it I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real right it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means that when you read something something quickens in your heart and you either want to read it again or you want to dive a little bit deeper now if that doesn't if that doesn't if that's not part of your life you need the new birth listen the new birth groans for the word word to be brought to him brother said the Holy Ghost is waiting in you for you to bring in the word so he can Quicken it you can't Quicken the word and be lost you got to be part of the word you got to be part of the one that wrote it you got to have his mind and when you got his mind you can look through your eyes into the Bible and you can see that Unwritten part that Unwritten part that's for you that's for you and me amen it won't take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost now like brother Aaron said Wednesday night he said it's not in the shouting that's all After Effects yes sir and we love it we love the worship we I believe our worship has got up a little bit more than it used to be we're more free to be able to express yourself but you're not expressing yourself you're expressing Jesus Christ and then he's happy about it so he's going to just pour it on listen we bind the Holy Ghost is that right we bind him that's why I said when you walk through that door you don't have to hit the door but when you come that through that door you ought to shed all them demons we was talking about and come in here at least with maybe just a few of them cuz some people going to come in here with them anyway cuz remember you either leave Better or Worse brother R say so if you leave worse you took them demons in and you taking them back out listen this is a place for deliverance and not just to deliver us to pray for somebody and the hair pins go flying everywhere that's okay they've had their time but I want somebody to stand here and say I have been changed by the word of God that you brother Aaron Brother Louise and brother Bob preach in this church I have been delivered by that and I don't think leaving brother R's name out he bothered that bothered him one bit CU in the days of the voice of the seventh angel even God give it to a special class of people brother R says that means this book can't be revealed to anyone now watch anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight what is prophetic Insight is being able to look at something and know what it is without having to read it three or four times amen I know we do that I know we how many of you have read scripture and then somebody got up read one the other day brother bobber somebody read one in Corinthians and I I could have swore i' never heard that in my life right well pray for me I know it don't happen to y'all I'm me I'm the one that's a ratch up here I guess cuz everybody's like I mean really have we read books listen to tapes amen and somebody come right here brother Dale was good at reading quotes he read many quotes he'd read a quote out of the church age book and you're like I just read that last week and I didn't get that you know what it wasn't your time that's why this Bible is only 66 books there only like 20 something thousand words in here that's the Eternal Word of God and I'm holding it right here in my hand but what is it it's an unfolding of every word you can read through read it read it read it read it I read Corinthians 100 times but when that brother read it whoever when it was read it several weeks ago I'm like man that just fits with what I've been thinking about and that's God that's God revealing it when you need it he knows he can't pour it all in you at one time he said cuz you can't stand it that's why brother Ram it took him 1,00 sermons to bring us and how many thousands of sermons we preach from that say we from 65 when he passed away till today there's probably been millions of sermons preached from those 1100 some of their own opinion some of the truth everybody with me right but it only be given to a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God you say I'm just I'm too young Now read that in the Bible to me he said you got to come as a babe didn't Jesus say you got to come as a babe to understand who I am understand the kingdom let you come as a kid reveal it to babes and then we grow up it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why you need a five-fold Ministry that's filled with the spirit of God that Taps into every resource they have you bring an evangelist here he's not going to preach to you marriage in divorce he's going to lift you up or he's going to expose some kind of sin that you have or something in your life that and make the people happy that's what a that's what an evangelist does pastor preaches on the things like that different ones a prophet comes in cleans the place up they got different things you know amen but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear now watch to hear and to know not just here the letter kth but the spirit giveth life remember the Lord 1963 we were talking about this last Sunday but remember there are certain things in the message and that's what we're going to get to with the with the third PLL and all the different seals and different things there's a requirement amen that you get this this is the age for it this is the Revelation time for it this is God speaking to you I'm not speaking to you today I hope God's speaking to your heart somewhere but listen if there's anything lacking with us let's get back to that let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have well if I was God I'd do it this way well you ain't God and you do it wrong cuz God don't make a mistake God God's perfect so let's just yield oursel to him okay not what we think we ought to have but what he said we've got to have we got to have it that way the way that he said it now let me bring you an example how many of you here today if I could come here and bring a bring a um a good denominational I'm talking about a good teacher and let him teach you about Trinity now if it changes your mind you don't have the mind of God yeah right you got a problem if he can change your mind that's the hamburger and the hot dog but if you get the real revelation of the spirit of God what has it become it has become you you have become the mystery that God's talking about in Genesis 126 because Genesis 126 is only a special class of people I just believe that that's why I love Genesis 126 because I look at it I see it I see it in other brothers and sisters and churches and different places I see that Genesis 1 126 man being unfolded I pray today that you see that you're part of that Genesis 126 man that you have the Holy Ghost in your soul and that you are an invincible Army and that you can defeat the Devil yes not by yourself but with that you can defeat listen that Genesis 126 man Satan is still don't know what that is I'm sorry he don't know what that is oh he might have an idea let us make man in our own image God what are you talking about you know I can see God he says now devil you I gave you you you you open the Service you you're the worship Angel you open the service and I'll handle the preaching but now what Satan want to do Satan wanted to preach cuz he did remember he preached to Eve pretty convincing and he also preached to angels and they took his lie and that's who's here today trying to give you that lie all right am brother Ram said look the Lord told him if you'll continue to be sincere and humble it'll grow greater and greater now this ministry is going to step higher now into another realm who'll be far beyond what it is now he got this idea I didn't say idea he got this Revelation in 1958 but he didn't get the whole Revelation that's right I read y'all the other day he he comes through 1958 to 1960 and he thinks it's something according to prayer lines and according to to what he saw in the vision of the tent and all that he thought it was going to be something greater coming through but he realized though and later in the spoken words Original Seed different ones 1962 he knew what that new ministry was he says in here I'll not read it for time we'll we'll close he said it's not in the discernment right justart from it it's not in the discernment part now listen he never lost that discernment listen today his message is still Discerning we were talking about those people that have that have left the message they couldn't number one be born again you know that right but they have absolutely they have nowhere else to go right so so they turn to drinking and they go right back out in the world there's only a few one or two that even goes to church anymore why there's nothing else to do how are you going to get something if you come to here and you got the Cadillac how you going to go back to the bicycle I'm sorry but how you going you get in the fullness here and you going to go back to part you never knew what this was to begin with I hope today we understand and it's Quicken what we believe yes what is part of our life that's not in the Bible it is the Bible it is the Bible you're the reason it was written and God saw you today whatever scripture you need today tomorrow the next day he put it in there before the foundation work CU he looked down through time and said hey oh brother D's going to have a question about this I'm going to give him a scripture and it'll come to his mind did that ever happen to you happened to me a little bit more than it we've done it'll be a new ministry look this ministry will never cease this ministry will continue on the first will continue on it's still just the same God gives gifts he don't take them back so listen when we come to the place of of next Sunday we'll talk about the or the next Sunday about the three polls it'll be first poll second pull third pole now you say well that's foreign to me okay all right you say that's foreign to me say just say that's foreign to me I don't understand what what in the world brother R was talking about pulling you know three pulls well it was so important that the angel told him he said this is that third pull amen so if you think it's just words and you think it's just something for Brother brandham by himself no the angel told brother brandham said this is that third pull I'll read it to you in a couple weeks amen and who's it for go talk to somebody about that I mean sorry but talk to the people the message they call it everything else amen you know they call it t brother Brown got to come back and this is happening this is happening bunch of baloney amen problem with people is is they don't know what they got now right right must left what's coming you got to know you got to be in what the present day truth amen didn't Paul tell us that you got to be what established in the present day truth are we established in the present day truth not Mana from back there it's got wiggle Tails but fresh Mana comes to you and I he went to Luther he went to Wesley he had all these different um Pentecost and he he he told us about justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost first pull second pull third P it all comes in you and I have one Jesus had one he said Noah had a third P had three PS it's a Ministry around the people that are there at that time am I clear it's a Ministry for the People John Wesley did not talk about the third pull the Pentecostals never talked about the third pull but when brother randam comes on the scene the seals get ready to open brother brandham says he says the first pull was what the first pull was the prayer line Second pull was discernment third pole was the opening of the word we'll read it just a little bit later on in a couple weeks but you and I are written Epistles so you say well where can I find a first pull in the Bible where can I find verbatim second pull in the Bible Well find me verbatim where Abraham's body was changed that's right right find me where God was going to send H H uh William brandham now we know he sent Elijah but sent William brandham to open the seals it's not in the Bible everybody with me but we know it is why because it's written in m and your heart yes sir it's written in our soul it's written where nobody Satan can't take that out see Satan can't get in that Genesis 126 man he can't be a part of it that's right he's out of the loop I tell you what when God's standing there saying let there be and he starts creating all this stuff you know all these things and and remember he created the devil first right rightand man so he's standing right here he ain't off you know doing something else he's standing right there and he's watching he's like man let me do that God said no ain't for you you stay right there in your place and then he starts creating and then he says let us make man in our own image Satan looks around he said I don't see nobody then all of a sudden brother I'm tell us there's a light comes out that light comes out and even starts saying let there be that light the Lost comes out and the devil's going who's that and now now God you're talking about making somebody in your image where they at and I'm sure God's just smiling cuz he knows the plan Satan doesn't know the plan but Satan tries to attach himself to the plan just like he does now but then all of a sudden out of that steps Michael and Satan's like now come on man this is confusing you're over there you got this you got a light and I feel the I feel the power of that guy where'd that guy come from oh you say you're trinitarian no I'm just telling you the forms of God that he took that he moved down and to get to then all of a sudden here's a man stands there that says I'm lonely Adam not in flesh yet uh and then he comes down to flesh and he says I'm lonely so Satan is watching this movement and he's going I couldn't see that man before but what's all this dust coming together for you ever look at it like that cuz you ought to be able to if you got sorry I ain't nobody special but if you got the mind of God and you can see what brother bradam saw and then you see what you see in the Bible you ought to be able to stand there be standing there cuz you were amen now I don't believe in this garbage that people come shaking hands say oh brother we met before the foundation of the world no we did not that's right brother R what were we before we were born he said you were nothing only in the mind of God now tell me Satan can get into the mind of God no no way you and I can you and I can we have access to it we had a prophet say let's go back into the back part of God's mind and Satan's like and that and and God's like no that's not for you he said but that's a that's a sinner man he was he was born in sin he he denied you he he did this and he did that and he almost shot himself twice or shot himself one time almost committed suicide again he sh almost shot them eight boys I mean them boys with that gun he did this he did that he's My Chosen he's the one I'm working with now you can do a lot to him you can take his b baby you can take his wife but you're not taking him cuz he come from my mind and you cannot destroy the mind of God so today if you're born again you have that same mind you're a part of that Genesis 126 man that today is being made real and Satan that's where he cannot get a hold of you because you're a child of God and he's the devil they don't mix but you're either one of the two today so it's not discernment discernment I find them things out but this is not discernment I'm searching for a new ministry let me read this real quick what discernment was what the very secrets of the heart right they would walk up brother R just like I said he would he said I'm contacting their spirit and he said he said you got to remember I'm not looking at that person I just read it the other day when he I can't remember the book I was reading but he said I'm not looking at that person cuz he's telling people to be still don't move he actually in wherever he was at he was in somewhere in Arkansas he had to stop the prayer line he said I told y'all not to move he said God has left the place because people was you know running around doing stuff moving he said don't move he said I'm not looking at that person he said I'm looking at their life he said said I'm way back in their life somewhere I'm not looking at that person right now that's right now listen I don't want that but you have a degree of it already amen I really don't want to know what y'all thinking right now but God does he knows the very secrets of your heart absolutely am he knows what your heart's thinking listen he knows what your heart is feeding on Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing now what the word of God so if the word's been brought pure and unadulterated by the prophet to us all right written in our heart then it's a two-edged sword piering even to the dividing a Sund of Soul and Spirit and Joint marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of of the heart brother bery was here a couple weeks ago and he didn't know anything that certain people were going through but he absolutely give them scripture told them what was going on but he never called a name and he didn't know who it was but they knew who it was amen they knew what they were going through and God sent to me see to me that's that's God moving in a church not that we had a pillar of fire come down right not that we shouted and spok in tongues run up down the aisle but God sent a person here from South Carolina that didn't know any of those people that were having that very issue he was talking about and he comes right here and steps right here and anointing strikes him he preaches it I don't know if he's in his notes or not but he answered the question they had that's God to me that's a gift that de the devil can't get a hold of that God has sent to a group of people not just us group of people but the whole bride around the world he's speaking through us all the time because he has no other voice but mine and your voice brother Bram said remember he has no other hands but your hands he has no other feet but your feet he has no other eyes but your eyes so remember that brother Ram had the dream or the brothers had the dream and then you had the pyramid with the things on the outside then he ripped the top off and I've read this and I'll read it maybe again later on but remember what happened he said stay here I'll read let's get down a little quick and I'll close right here he said went West returned back with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word which was what when that pyramid came off brother brandham had preached up to the faith of the fathers he preached it right back to right here right and then the Holy Spirit anointed him to continue on to take the unwritten part that nobody could read didn't even see it remember he interpreted an Unwritten Unwritten word right or he's a false prophet man I can't believe brother Aaron I was looking the other day I thought all these things that brother Ram did that was in continuity with God and they call him a false prophet they call him a liar because he lied about the you know where he was at and he lied about this Lord help all these other things all the the prayer lines and all these things that he said that came to pass no they're deceived if you're part of that Genesis 126 man you will not deny this Bible you will not deny the prophet's message because it's the very fiber of what you live that's why you come to church here not over there not here I'm talking about in Lula that's why you come to the message of the hour cuz there's something inside of you that's different there's something that Rings a little bit different right so we got first pull second pull third poll first PLL was what it was healing second PLL was prophesying now we'll get into that and the third poll is the opening of the word he said the Mysteries revealed and that's in the an O once at the end time the very day when this messenger not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message see the very day when not when he starts he started by reading the outside of the pyramid because this is the faith of the fathers it's all this right here it's the faith of the fathers this is the seals right this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed this is revealing anointed ones at the end time the grace of marriage and divorce all the different things that he preached after the seals were open amen that's right am so he told them he said hey stop and look on that he went and got the unwritten part got to Arizona the angel said go back to Jeffersonville he said the pope be told you there and everything that brother brandom said now I want you to listen to me cuz I'm going to read them we're going to get in a seal book I'm going to read to you first seal he said I'd have made he looking over my old notes he said I'd have made a horrible mistake if I have said what I said off my old notes now I'm telling you he told us this that's right it's not here say on tap he said I made a horrible mistake cuz in 1957 1959 he preached Mighty conqueror and he preached that as the Holy Ghost Cupid shooting arrows of love and they didn't have arrows it's a bow with no arrows it's a it's a bluff second seal he said I thought something something different third seal fifth seal he thought that was Saints now didn't come on that's what he said he said it this Ain here say he said it on tape he said this is beyond what I have seen oh what a prophet amen I'm glad we had a prophet that told us all of his faults and all his failures and how many times he tried to kill himself and how many times he did this how many times he didn't do what God Said praise God for a man that could tell us that and still be a prophet of God still be somebody that God used God didn't quit using him when he tried to kill himself right that's just part of his human Journey right and if he hadn't God hadn't to shut them bullets off he'd he would have been a murderer right he was going to shoot them eight kids or whatever how many kids that was he going to shoot them he said I emptied my gun and none of went off he said but I went somewhere else load him back up pow pow pow pow pow so you tell me who that was that was God that was God protecting a gift right that you and I could get it today and not be stuck in a prison somewhere for being a murderer or taking his own life people hate for you to talk about that they hate hate for you to say anything about that but I just I just love it that he told it I don't care about all this garbage that people said he did and this and that he set on tape he said say what did the brother R say he said say what set on tape right you won't go wrong if you'll say what set on tape well I'm going to tell you he said he was going to reach and grab that wire and take his life he said the next thing I know I was down at the bottom of the pole took the gun out going to shoot them kids remember he did get in several fights of course he was a boxer but remember when his told him to tie the string on his finger and count every how many times he said remember what he did he said I th throw that thing down and I went at it a prophet I'm glad he was so human till I can understand him and I can relate to how he grew up and I can relate Now by what God used him for and how what he said broke the seal that had been sealed since the foundation of the world Amen and he broke it to me and you you're recipients of that message let's stand musicians come on first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed you know we sat here today stand here today or sit here today and talk about Mysteries and and uh we kind of get a little get a little bored or our eyelids start getting getting heavy but I'll promise you you go watch a mystery movie you'll not go to sleep for nothing in the world cuz you want to know what's happening next I'm going to tell you something folks I got my eyes open today cuz I want to know what's happening next God is not going to hide listen to me not God's not going to hide his mysteries from his true bride he's going to make known his Mysteries through me and you that's the only way he's not going to come down in a pillow fire and do it he came down the pillar of fire but that's a sign amen that Pillar of Fire was a sign that God was there you love the Lord let's sing a song before we get before we take communion God bless you we

communion with God let him look at you let him give you Revelation and if not and his let will Revelation to get rid of what you want to get rid of he promised he would all the time he put a song of

the love of the Lord goes past anything yes we can comprehend abely he loved us so much he died for us didn't have to he could have just created that Genesis 126 man and just put us out there on Earth but like brother Brown said there was attributes there was attributes in God to be a father Amen to be a Healer in other words to be a well-rounded God a God that we can depend on so he had to let the fall happen he had to come to a day when he we're going to read where he raised the cup and this is a new testament in my blood he was going to die the next day but he was going to die for me and you and he said you do this and remembrance of me on Good Friday he did this went to a grave Thursday night then Friday he went to he died put him in a grave but thank God he ain't like Muhammad thank God he ain't like Buddha their grave still full that's right even listen even Lazarus grave is full again lazzar's grave was empty at one time but that was temporary we're looking at a time in this end time to where the grave won't not just not hold us the grave won't take us I mean we know that that died that and and all the on just went on the Grave's not going to hold them but there's going to be a group of people is not going to have to go into that and be brought back out I promise you well thus sayi the lord it's going to happen somebody's going to stand here and say I ain't going in there

communion God bless you thank you all again for for your confidence if if you ever need anything I'm here I ain't no there ain't no big eyes or little you there's no we were me and brother dut was talking yesterday I just I just uh I don't like sitting on the pull pit when somebody else is preaching I want you to listen to them not looking at me I went to preach for a place one time and um poor brother he he was more Pentecostal anything else I guess but the whole service he sat right there not here but he sat in his church sat right there not a person looked at me they looked at him they looked at him to see if he'd shake his head or or ow me or roll his eyes cuz they did the same thing he did if they said he said amen they said amen I don't want you to ever ever look at me while somebody's preaching cuz I'm looking at that guy wanting something from God right and you should look at that brother wanting something from God not what he thinks or what oh I ain't going to do that it's not a one man's show you ought to feel freedom to worship say Amen when you want to you can say oh me when you want to amen it's all right we'll all get over it we're we're we're grown folks aren't we brother cly amen but God bless you let's read the scripture oh I was going to say Brother Anderson he's sitting he's standing right here you're a long way off for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had St saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come today should be a dying out we should get rid of the things that we've that we've held on to for even for a month yeah you can yeah even Christians we can feel we can feel like we've got a burden on us but this communion is not going to do it physically that Wine's not going to do it or bread but the the what the representation that he died to release you from all that he said lay your burdens on me lay them on him sometimes we fight we fight too much let God fight for us we try to fight we try to make our you know this is way our kids should be or this is way my husband or my wife should be and all this turn over to God right my Mama Tried to save me for 20 something years and and bless bless bless her heart her prayers did but not just because she's who she is Dad either the real Daddy's the one that showed up when the real daddy showed up that day then I know I didn't have to yeah Daddy could my my physical daddy could be somewhere else but that Daddy stays with you all the time wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself examine yourself today and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another If any man hunger late him meet at home that you come not together into condemnation and Paul tells them the rest he'll sh said in order when he gets there in other words he goes and visits the Corinthians again and he tells them about certain other things he wasn't finished he was just getting started with them but that one point God gave to Paul to give to us and he wasn't even a witness that's how God works he wasn't even there amen and he told it so vividly that none of the other ones uh what you say in in the old term bucked him about it you know what do you mean you giving this to the Corinthians and and you want even there Peter said Paul says some things hard to be understood that's kind of what he said he said so just leave it alone CU God give it to him and revealed it to him and we take it and we take it according to what Paul saw dear heavenly father Lord I pray that you'd bless this bread Lord been made the correct way it's been made Lord at tonight it'll be destroyed and there'll be new bread made next time father just like you're bringing new to us Lord Revelation every day father I pray that you'll not leave us or forsake us Lord that you'll be with us always in Jesus name amen sometimes I wonder um I here I go again sitting in the upper room but you wonder what Judas is thinking you know what's in his mind he's getting ready to go turn him in right right and you know Jesus even washes his feet he gives him communion he didn't take it away from him we and brother Dutch are talking about last night about having open communion he had some people come in off the street and he happen to have communion that day well he explained a little bit but they took it anyway you can't stop them maybe it'll strike home somewhere right but we've always had open communion here dad's never it's just not it's it's exclusive in that we it right but it's not exclusive that we don't let anybody else come if you think you can take it then that's between you and the Lord that's why it said you discern the body and blood of the lord well what's the body of the lord it's us the bride Heavenly Father Lord bless this wine Lord has been prepared just for this I pray this is Sanctified to our bodies Lord be with us keep us and direct us in the things that we need to do Lord this coming year if we make it to the next year father through Lord I pray that you just bless us now and give us strength in Jesus name amen come morning I'll walk by the river I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross see we got to carry a cross too we didn't have to get on it it we just got to carry one there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected but not by Jesus and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I'll walk by the river if you ever get in a place where you get all mad and angry and upset start singing that song this is one of the most peaceful songs if you'll think about what it's telling you carry my cross through the mid night but I'm going to sit beside a river one day and I ain't got to get up I ain't got to go to work won't be a cloud in the sky won't be no rain won't be no floods won't be no earthquakes tsunamis amen won't be no bills to pay amen won't need an accountant sorry brother John you've been changed don't need a mechanic sorry brother Donnie God's already built our house so Brother Gary can rest all these different things that we do now listen we labor in this world but now when we get there as I read that scripture ey has not seen or ear has heard you can't you today when you leave here I hope you heard some what I said but if you leave here when you get in that car right sir tomorrow I got to go to this I got to go to work I got to do this I got to get the bill done June's got to go do this the dog needs this the cat needs that the house needs this and we just get full of it right but one day it'll be nothing but fellowship and we can't fathom that but God said it and you know what I don't know how he's going to do it but he said he'd do it so I'm is going to leave it to him that's right he's already built it it's done it's finished he ain't got to build it amen the only reason he told he said I got to go away is because he had to come inside of us and build it in us that's the only way he was doing he wasn't talking about building a house up there he's talking about building a bride talk about building a group of people that have prophetic Insight did you see the uh did you see the article the other day about the Pop's getting really sick and you know who they're looking at yep one from the United States can't remember his name but he's Cardinal so and so and even even there was some Catholic people um making comments about it that that it would be uh yeah Louis's get Louis in there that um that it would be a blasphemy it would be back to Nazism I mean there's a lot of people against the popee coming out of the United States they don't want that but brother randam said it could happen so this Pope is getting really sick and he's going to he's going to he's going to eventually die and when he does yeah get him too get him don't forget brother Louise God bless him in there working preaching his heart out but yeah it I don't know where I got the article off of somewhere it was online and it was from some news Reuters or somebody that they were showed his picture now they ain't talked about that in a long long time and this Pope is really sick so folks brother Brown said watch when the pope comes out of the United States cuz you know who's sitting in office right now and you see what's happening with that you ain't talking about fast this thing is happening real fast so yet you know what that's okay even so come quickly Lord Jesus let's take thank you Lord the Bible tells us that after supper was ended Jesus after and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas that's carat Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and he come from God and he went to God he rised from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter I'm sure after the day of Pentecost he knew exactly what was going on Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell Jesus never don't
