[10:45] i'm going to read the 11th verse pickle
[10:47] paul speaking
[10:49] first corinthians 13 chapter 11 verse
[10:52] paul says
[10:53] when i was a child
[10:56] i spoke as a child
[10:58] i understood as a child
[11:00] i thought as a child right but when i
[11:03] became a man
[11:05] i put away childhood things
[11:07] let me go to second
[11:09] timothy three
[11:11] for one verse from there
[11:15] second timothy
[11:22] second timothy the third chapter verse
[11:24] seven
[11:25] paul's activities speaking here
[11:27] says
[11:29] ever learning and never able to come to
[11:32] the knowledge
[11:34] of the truth
[11:35] let's pray
[11:37] i gracious father
[11:39] help me one more time to yield my body
[11:41] and my mind
[11:43] my soul to you father
[11:45] father god i give you all my script this
[11:47] evening lord and father i trust that you
[11:49] take over
[11:50] and bless your peoples father yes in
[11:53] jesus christ's name
[12:04] i like the way the scripture says here
[12:06] paul says here when i was a child
[12:09] because i thought as a child
[12:12] all right praise god amen my brother
[12:15] forgot your name
[12:17] brother dan you pray i just saw you out
[12:19] in new mexico
[12:21] man you want me to call me when
[12:33] when i was a child
[12:35] i thought as a child
[12:37] i understood as a child he said but when
[12:40] i became a man i put away childhood
[12:43] things right
[12:44] i like the way he said here and then we
[12:45] finally in the book of timothy said
[12:47] forever learning and never able to come
[12:50] to the knowledge of the truth
[12:52] if i had a title
[12:55] i'm going to use this title
[12:57] failing to grow up
[12:59] into the law of maturity
[13:01] and the word maturity means
[13:03] a full grown as a plant
[13:05] and it means they're ripe and it means
[13:07] the comfort formation have a fruit layer
[13:10] in the sun
[13:11] also and i look up the word immaturity i
[13:14] invited me a simple-minded person it
[13:17] means that christian bay hallelujah so
[13:20] we realize him paul we realized that
[13:22] child here we we looked it up it means
[13:25] one uh to make sport as a boy i need
[13:28] another word you come i didn't come i
[13:31] did not come to play church we did not
[13:34] come to make a sport we come to grow up
[13:36] right
[13:37] it's what god required for us to come to
[13:40] maturity so we will be ready when the
[13:43] rapture takes place
[13:45] i took your uh
[13:57] brains that make it clear enough in
[13:59] maturity so we begin to look at
[14:06] the lord help me
[14:07] to grow into the full stature of what
[14:10] you want me to be right
[14:12] so as i begin to go in and i think on
[14:14] the things that that god wanted to come
[14:17] to that full stature of a revelation of
[14:19] the word of god amen now i begin to
[14:21] think here i begin to realize we see
[14:24] something that's not growing
[14:27] something that's growing normal like
[14:29] when i go overseas and especially when
[14:31] you travel the sea you'll notice
[14:33] sometimes you'll run into a a lot of
[14:35] children that be born with no hands
[14:38] i'll be born with no legs
[14:41] from birth that child will come that way
[14:43] from birth you'll see that child in your
[14:44] heart and go out because you realize
[14:46] that child ain't got no arms and no feet
[14:48] on all the legs and nothing like that
[14:50] but my burpee was born that way but when
[14:52] i started that out the only reason that
[14:55] child was born that way because
[14:57] something was wrong with his dna right
[14:59] how did something went wrong with the
[15:01] dna it was something that his body needs
[15:04] that he didn't get right right
[15:06] so we realized we are not growing
[15:09] properly and we're not growing normal if
[15:12] something is wrong and we're not coming
[15:14] to maturity there's something wrong with
[15:16] the gene of god all right right
[15:18] you got you you claim you god right your
[15:21] experience with god something wrong with
[15:22] that spiritual experience right how many
[15:26] if you're a son of god you must come to
[15:28] that law of maturity because god put a
[15:31] gene i'll put a life in you that develop
[15:34] itself right
[15:35] on the full statue of jesus christ
[15:48] that's right
[15:49] learning something over and over
[15:51] i find in the messages that travel
[15:53] through the years here and the thing
[15:55] that we find the most other people still
[15:57] going around service
[15:59] you know themselves
[16:01] you come back
[16:02] and they're still going in the same
[16:04] house that they had last year and the
[16:18] if you're learning something over and
[16:20] over and you don't never
[16:22] if you fall in a hole and you keep
[16:24] falling in the same hole you're not
[16:26] learning right
[16:27] quick
[16:28] the school they call it a learning
[16:29] disorder yeah right
[16:32] there's something wrong with your
[16:33] revelation how did that suddenly roll
[16:35] with your faith how did god been trying
[16:37] to teach us to have faith how to hold
[16:40] them to the word of god and still people
[16:42] say i i try to be saved
[16:45] but i can't make it i tried to be saved
[16:47] and i lost myself thank you
[16:54] and if you ever get a revelation you're
[16:56] a son of god you get a revelation where
[16:58] you come from and if you ever get a
[17:00] revelation where you come from you get a
[17:01] revelation where you're going i make
[17:03] sure you don't let nothing ever push you
[17:05] down only because you know who you are
[17:07] right yeah man
[17:09] some people get here look at maturity
[17:10] for a few minutes cuz i look at this
[17:12] here and i begin to think what is
[17:14] maturity
[17:15] maturity
[17:16] is mature person
[17:19] that learned how to handle himself in
[17:20] every circumstance
[17:22] circumstances do not control you right
[17:25] you control the certain things
[17:29] come to the revelation that he is able
[17:32] to control the circumstances
[17:35] now when i was when i was a child
[17:37] it was not important i could jump up and
[17:39] go to work right
[17:41] come on you know how they were
[17:43] 40 to 50 years old you know you said if
[17:46] you didn't feel like going to work you
[17:47] would call in or make any kind of
[17:49] because you feel like it ain't going to
[17:51] work today
[17:53] out here
[17:54] and i'm going to enjoy this day i got
[17:56] things i need to do but when you begin
[17:58] to grow up and become a man you look at
[18:01] your two little children and three
[18:02] little children you say i gotta make my
[18:04] body get up and go to work because i
[18:07] gotta prepare for my family
[18:10] right
[18:11] for you to do
[18:12] that and then we begin to relax here so
[18:15] we gotta we gotta grow up we gotta come
[18:17] to that level maturity so if we're gonna
[18:19] become we're gonna grow up we're gonna
[18:21] have some law in the world to grow up
[18:23] under right management something's gonna
[18:25] teach us majority right
[18:27] all right when i'm studying this i said
[18:30] understand this in inspiration use the
[18:32] scripture so i did let it go to saint
[18:35] john 8
[18:36] and find out here we got to have some
[18:38] guidelines
[18:40] we got to have some guideline to teach
[18:41] us
[18:42] because we gotta go we got to grow in
[18:44] maturity so we gotta have some guideline
[18:47] to grow one right so so i
[18:50] pulled up saint john eight
[18:54] saint john eighth chapter i want to read
[18:56] one verse from there
[18:57] say
[18:58] john a chapter
[19:00] verse 32
[19:02] hey lord jesus speaking to him
[19:05] jesus said
[19:06] ye shall know the truth
[19:09] and the truth shall make you free all
[19:11] right
[19:12] so now he's telling us
[19:14] yes you know the truth i'm concerned
[19:16] about truth right honey
[19:19] if you're gonna mature in faith you
[19:21] gotta mature in the truth because you
[19:23] cannot have faith without every truth
[19:27] and in the world shall we find him that
[19:29] he will jesus come how did he say when i
[19:32] come shall i find faith on earth exactly
[19:35] right
[19:36] not only
[19:37] shitty fat truth all right
[19:39] that's right jesus was concerned about
[19:41] truth
[19:43] he was not so much concerned about your
[19:44] condition and he wasn't concerned about
[19:47] did you have a heart to speak truth
[19:50] right
[19:50] so when it came to the woman and she was
[19:53] caught in the act of adultery her body
[19:55] was messed up her life was messed up
[19:58] everything she died you could look back
[20:00] and say she was no good she did this and
[20:02] she didn't die but when jesus said go
[20:04] get your husband she gotta help you he
[20:07] said you said true exactly how because
[20:09] he was concerned about truth right yeah
[20:10] i think he needed the word he knew she
[20:12] was in that condition she would speak
[20:14] truth he knew that she could receive
[20:16] truth right
[20:17] so if she can speak the truth she can
[20:19] receive truth so when jesus said jesus
[20:22] said woman you have said truth
[20:24] right because maybe he always knows the
[20:26] truth yeah he said you have said truth
[20:29] he said you have had five and the one
[20:31] you got not your husband how did he
[20:33] begin to go and reveal our condition and
[20:35] set him free because he sees something
[20:38] in her that spoke the truth right amen
[20:41] he didn't see that in the pharisees
[20:43] right he said you are the liar and your
[20:45] father's alive but because he knew that
[20:47] they couldn't speak truth holly didn't
[20:49] have no true feeling so he said your
[20:51] father is a liar you got a testimony you
[20:54] love me you got to testify you serve me
[20:57] but you're already fall from me right
[20:59] exactly
[21:00] right until we come back so he says here
[21:04] when i come shall i find faith
[21:07] he was living for one day and god is
[21:09] concerned about one day right he's
[21:11] concerned about faith
[21:13] because without faith nobody leaves this
[21:16] earth right
[21:17] nobody leave the earth without faith all
[21:19] right because it's impossible to please
[21:22] god without revelation faith right amen
[21:26] so you know the bible said when he come
[21:29] shall he find faith on the earth
[21:32] so what do you he didn't say what he
[21:34] would look he just i was looking for how
[21:36] holy you look that comes along with it
[21:38] your might conform to that but people
[21:41] deliver and have a dress code and not
[21:43] have faith right right amen hey be good
[21:46] people can live holy they can look holy
[21:48] and still not have faith
[21:51] shout out by the faith all right man
[21:53] tell us somebody right they got the same
[21:56] revolution of faith that i live by amen
[21:59] somebody that walked by the same
[22:01] revelation of faith that i won't buy
[22:03] anyway you said brother jordan you can't
[22:05] walk by the same faith that jesus walked
[22:07] by it ain't for one faith
[22:09] and if you got famous the same thing
[22:12] because paul said the life that i now
[22:14] knew i don't live by my life but i live
[22:17] by the faith from the son of god
[22:19] say revelation in jesus
[22:24] up have christ
[22:26] so he was concerned about faith yeah
[22:29] and the story goes when jesus
[22:32] come on earth
[22:34] manifested in the emanuel which is
[22:36] interpreted god with us that's right god
[22:38] came down kepler's skin welcome us
[22:42] right honey and welcome on his own
[22:44] people
[22:45] and they could not generate enough faith
[22:48] to accept what he really was right right
[22:51] he never found the faith he was looking
[22:53] for in his own peoples
[22:55] right the faith that he found was in
[22:58] gentiles
[23:00] that's right
[23:02] you know let's go to state memphis
[23:08] you said you used scripture yet because
[23:10] i'm about to become a new book
[23:11] right
[23:12] my shields opened made my mind real
[23:14] right
[23:16] so say matthew eight same same thing
[23:20] they look at jesus he was looking for
[23:21] faith
[23:22] and he never found nobody with this type
[23:25] of faith he finally come across a man
[23:28] that had the same revelation he had
[23:31] right right
[23:32] let us
[23:33] look at say matthew 8 verse 5.
[23:35] the bible says
[23:37] when jesus had entered into capernaum
[23:39] that came unto him a such a satanist
[23:42] proceeding him
[23:43] saying lord what you didn't notice here
[23:46] he came to him the sixth verse
[23:48] i want you to notice how he approached
[23:50] him
[23:51] his approach was with the word right he
[23:54] did not approach him in son of david
[23:57] because jesus would have rebuked him
[23:59] instantly right yeah because jesus
[24:01] wouldn't send the david to the gentiles
[24:03] right and then so he said lord he report
[24:06] he approached him in his redemptive name
[24:09] how do you approach you in a redemptive
[24:11] name i am the lord thy god they heal him
[24:14] all that he's either i'm the lord
[24:16] jehovah i am the lord raphael and i only
[24:19] read the title that gold in the name of
[24:22] the lord he said lord all right
[24:25] he approached him with the right title
[24:27] yes
[24:28] hallelujah
[24:29] if you notice in this title he never
[24:31] turned nobody away
[24:32] because it was a redemption amen
[24:34] hallelujah shall hear you so he said he
[24:37] said lord my son relies at home
[24:41] sick of a sick of apology greenlee told
[24:44] me in other words this guy didn't just
[24:47] have a toothache right he had a demon
[24:50] but he had a demon problem right
[24:52] something that was told me to him to
[24:53] irritate him something something that
[24:56] that something that you know there's
[24:57] something on the inside of you he
[24:59] couldn't just shake off he had a demon
[25:01] problem right now
[25:03] and what that this young man said
[25:05] and he come to him the seventh verse i
[25:08] want you to watch jesus as he speak to
[25:09] this young man jesus said unto him
[25:12] i will come and heal him right
[25:15] why do you think jesus said this
[25:18] because jesus knew
[25:20] that none of them other brothers ever
[25:22] believed that he could uh have faith
[25:25] except he went to the house and brought
[25:27] his body down yeah all right right
[25:29] that's right they had to touch something
[25:30] to believe right but if you have to test
[25:32] something to believe you ain't got
[25:33] proper faith right because faith is the
[25:35] evidence of things not even seen right
[25:37] so everybody be funny so know what you
[25:39] think you say why you said you got
[25:40] attention why do you think michael said
[25:42] lord if you would have been here my
[25:44] brother would have died
[25:46] right because they looking for jesus
[25:47] body to be there except or instead of
[25:50] accepting his word his word i seek my
[25:54] word and my
[26:06] yeah right
[26:07] touch the him of his glory
[26:23] for me i could be made whole a by the
[26:25] way get up here and pray for me i can be
[26:27] made whole i mean by people you don't
[26:29] need that body to be healthy

[29:05] this man was not a disciple of jesus
[29:08] this man didn't go fishing with jesus
[29:10] this
[29:24] and my faith come back here i can't hear
[29:27] it about all this he realized this has
[29:29] got to be god this has got to be
[29:31] repented and you're only god to do those
[29:34] things
[29:35] that's right exactly
[29:37] he says him yeah
[29:51] he began to explain to jesus
[29:55] who
[29:56] i know who you is right yeah
[29:59] if you would break this down in
[30:00] spiritual terms
[30:02] if you could open up the scene
[30:04] what you had meeting on earth
[30:06] to omnipotence all right yeah
[30:09] great man
[30:10] all right right they got to be something
[30:12] supernatural
[30:14] for your faith
[30:16] the same thing something got to take
[30:18] place
[30:19] because
[30:21] a man it
[30:21] have perfect faith and one before god
[30:24] right come on something's gonna happen
[30:26] right man two omnipotence meant amen all
[30:29] right and this man take control of the
[30:31] conversation
[30:32] right this man didn't need nobody he
[30:34] knew
[30:46] and he said i am a man under authority
[30:50] he explained his position right right i
[30:54] am a man under authority having soldiers
[30:56] under me
[30:59] and i say to this man
[31:01] go
[31:02] and he goes until another come
[31:06] and he come right and to my servant do
[31:09] this he does it
[31:11] he explained the power that was behind
[31:14] his word right right he explained that
[31:17] behind my word was the power of that
[31:19] state that was backing him up when i say
[31:21] to this man do what he do it right right
[31:24] amen when they tell me to do it i tell
[31:27] the next man to do it right
[31:29] here i understand this tell me about
[31:32] what he says right
[31:34] and the ten verses says
[31:37] when jesus heard it
[31:39] why jesus heard it because they come
[31:41] back here
[31:42] jesus went saying that he was listening
[31:44] let this man talk and the bible said
[31:46] when jesus heard it he knew it was
[31:48] perfect faith
[31:49] he knew that that was the revelation of
[31:51] perfect faith so nobody said he was not
[31:54] talking he was listening when this man
[31:56] was speaking and it moved him yeah
[32:04] and said unto them that father probably
[32:06] brother i said to you bloody brother i
[32:08] have nothing i said to you i am not
[32:11] found so what
[32:20] jesus and it was not our sensation it
[32:23] was not that shock it was about taking
[32:25] god in his word
[32:40] yeah take me up you
[32:43] 15
[32:45] chapters say me if you're oblivious
[32:49] you're saying that
[32:51] let me see here let me begin
[32:54] let me find my place here
[32:56] in the 22nd verse
[32:58] and listen behold
[33:00] a woman of canaan
[33:02] came out of the same coast and cried out
[33:05] to him said lord have mercy on me
[33:09] no lord you're saying
[33:11] have mercy on me oh lord
[33:13] thy son of david my daughter is
[33:16] grievingly
[33:17] vexed with a what
[33:20] not judgmental thing
[33:23] this demon was causing a major issue
[33:26] right and this woman had got tired of
[33:28] dealing with this baby right
[33:30] she got tired of the time what it was
[33:32] doing she's not telling her i'm going to
[33:35] probe jesus right
[33:36] and she no doubt she had hearing people
[33:39] calling himself today
[33:41] how you think she approached him that
[33:42] was she heard she did how this is when
[33:44] she came and she said not seven david
[33:47] and what's the 23rd verse
[33:49] but he hasn't heard or what
[33:52] people hate to be ignored
[33:54] all right but somebody didn't know you
[33:56] you normally get an attitude
[33:58] especially when you're speaking to
[33:59] somebody in the wreck and you talking to
[34:01] that person and you say something and
[34:03] they ignore you you normally get an
[34:06] attitude
[34:07] because we still mature yeah right all
[34:09] right
[34:11] what's wrong with that crown yeah
[34:14] can you hear me speak to it all right
[34:17] you know that's the way human reaction
[34:18] work yeah right let's do it jesus she's
[34:22] speaking to gina and he don't even have
[34:24] another word
[34:25] because the way she approached him was
[34:28] not for her right right she says him
[34:32] and he has heard not a word
[34:35] any disciples came in and we saw him
[34:38] saying
[34:39] send her away
[34:41] for she cries i does yeah
[34:44] now you know they was not grown they
[34:45] didn't have the holy ghost they were two
[34:47] churches
[34:51] but but did he say
[34:53] but he didn't he all right they actually
[34:56] sent her away jesus all right let me get
[34:58] rid of him he said
[35:00] but he hasn't said i am not sick
[35:03] but until the last sheet of
[35:06] the house of israel right
[35:07] then she came
[35:09] he said i'm not sitting there i am not
[35:11] sitting in lawsuits israel and then the
[35:13] mother said the twin river
[35:16] and worship him said lord help me and he
[35:18] answered and said it is not me to take
[35:21] your children bread and cast it to doubt
[35:24] right
[35:25] he heavily rebuked this woman right but
[35:28] you get changed faith
[35:43] what a dog healed the dog the lord thing
[35:45] one of the lowest creatures he's not
[35:47] identified and no sacrifice the bible
[35:50] said beware of dogs right yeah right all
[35:52] right
[35:55] spiritually speaking yeah right
[36:07] hot dog
[36:18] and she said true lord she acknowledged
[36:23] what he told her was the truth all right
[36:25] honey and then when he called it it's
[36:28] the truth we was undone we were shaking
[36:30] and everything we were lord and judge
[36:32] the dog that's true lord
[36:34] exactly
[36:36] that's not true
[36:38] true yep
[36:40] the dog keep the crown that that would
[36:42] fall from the master table and when
[36:44] jesus
[36:45] did jesus said unto her oh woman great
[36:49] is that thing right be it on your deed
[36:53] even as god willing and
[36:55] her daughter was made whole from that
[36:58] very hour because she understood
[37:01] revelation right
[37:03] faith move god amen now
[37:08] give me a few more minutes here let's
[37:09] wednesday night keep you all night don't
[37:11] get nervous you're fine so here it is
[37:15] we want to talk about mature faith
[37:18] faith that's growing yeah if you're not
[37:21] growing something wrong right right
[37:23] exactly if you're not growing if your
[37:25] faith is not coming closer to god
[37:27] something wrong
[37:28] so we know that mature faith now we're
[37:31] going on here because we got to see
[37:33] somebody bring an example of a true
[37:36] faith
[37:37] all right somebody live the example of
[37:40] faith that's growing right now right i
[37:42] looked in here i i was talking about
[37:44] dancing you know abraham was the perfect
[37:46] example of faith that grows right yeah
[37:50] honey he started off with a little
[37:52] mustard seed
[37:54] but at the end of the day it became a
[37:55] big tree right highly so his faith never
[37:59] stayed neutral right
[38:00] his faith growed right
[38:02] so abraham was called you've been with
[38:04] god called abraham
[38:07] he's able to get me up from that
[38:08] kendra's right
[38:09] and go to the land that i'll show you
[38:11] amen he told them to do this abraham was
[38:14] growing yeah amen just didn't get up and
[38:16] leave he carried his uncle with him
[38:19] a nephew with him yeah he get a daddy
[38:21] with it he didn't say he didn't want it
[38:23] to be abraham and his daddy he wanted to
[38:25] be able to help and him alone right him
[38:27] and his wife alone because she was under
[38:29] the same government so he wanted abraham
[38:32] to get up and leave but he didn't know
[38:34] because he'd be like i just take the
[38:36] rest of him along you know this is an
[38:38] individual wow it ain't about your mama
[38:40] it ain't about your daddy it's me oh
[38:42] lord amen
[38:50] and we know the story how it goes
[38:53] finally here
[38:54] god come down to tell abraham you're
[38:56] gonna have a son
[38:58] we understand that and abraham all right
[39:01] you know that was a good promise so now
[39:04] the point of it was abraham in his mind
[39:07] and sharing her mind thinking that we're
[39:09] gonna have the child it's gonna have to
[39:11] happen next year yeah
[39:25] yeah
[39:26] i cannot be the woman that he got in
[39:28] mind right i know i'm i'm almost past
[39:31] that
[39:32] and i know that i if it don't happen
[39:34] next year we're gonna have to come up
[39:35] with a solution yeah yeah yeah so she
[39:37] did hey god yeah yeah doesn't do it
[39:41] create your own so you can grow closer
[39:44] to god
[39:45] i'll give you something to keep you on
[39:46] your knee praying i'll keep you at the
[39:48] well and walk right right
[39:51] i'll keep you crying come lord jesus
[40:09] and got an ishmael
[40:11] right that's right you said
[40:13] sarah took this boy raising his own son
[40:16] yeah i did but the point over there
[40:19] told abraham yeah right you gonna have
[40:22] something
[40:31] god said it and we got to keep
[40:33] professing it keep hold on until it
[40:36] comes to passion
[40:41] one year
[40:43] two years
[40:44] three years maybe
[40:45] 12 years maybe 18 years next day
[40:48] 25 years later
[40:51] to abraham got to the point
[40:53] that he couldn't even help himself all
[40:55] right noah it was no way impossible
[40:58] scientifically impossible that said
[41:01] sarah will be able to have a baby
[41:03] and abraham to dry it up it was no hope
[41:06] that when god generally moved them all
[41:08] when it come to the end of the day when
[41:10] there ain't nothing else you could do
[41:11] but give up and say god you are in
[41:14] control i'm at the end of the road
[41:16] that's normally with god stepping right
[41:33] this was impossible
[41:35] scientifically was the medicine there
[41:36] was nothing to help abraham in the
[41:38] condition right right right because the
[41:39] birth of several women was dried up
[41:41] right
[41:42] that was good to dead people
[41:44] so god had to give a type of
[41:45] resurrection right so what did he do he
[41:47] took the clock and he reversed it yeah
[41:49] right so erin him had to back back
[41:52] though 25 years ago
[41:54] he might have went back a little further
[41:55] because he went back so far with the
[41:57] king saw sarah she was pretty beautiful
[41:59] yeah and he wanted my
[42:06] and he turned them back to young men
[42:08] nobody said they would turn anyway they
[42:10] would turn back i just didn't reduce the
[42:12] child anyway she would turn up again and
[42:15] they will help me tell you that was the
[42:16] revelation of this episode right honey
[42:19] the day of christ arrives right all
[42:21] right
[42:25] abraham the servant turned back how did
[42:27] something produce this child and when
[42:29] they return back here it was to bring a
[42:31] type of the bride he turned back he had
[42:33] to go get old and die
[42:36] he would turn back young he had plenty
[42:38] of churches after that right right
[42:41] those years between that he had a lot of
[42:43] children died this man kept multiplying
[42:45] right
[42:47] he had to be turned back to do this
[42:49] he would turn back
[42:51] but that was to give a type of bride
[42:53] we're going to be turned back and the
[42:55] dead christ should arrive
[43:24] right
[43:29] his mature reports
[43:31] abraham had to know how to have his
[43:33] civil circumstances sure so god revealed
[43:36] himself as el shaddaic
[43:52] revelation
[43:54] god when his name was changed
[43:57] he was growing in the majority right
[43:59] revelation 17.
[44:00] god never changed his name when he's
[44:02] named the change abraham was mature
[44:04] right how did he was growing into a
[44:05] mature son of god dude
[44:11] growing up right here everybody here
[44:13] abraham growing up that god turns around
[44:15] after abraham and tell abraham
[44:18] offer
[44:19] your only begotten son yeah
[44:23] and i looked at that as a guy couldn't
[44:25] have been
[44:26] abraham had
[44:27] abraham had ishmael too
[44:29] but abraham didn't have ishmael right
[44:32] abraham
[44:33] right
[44:34] but god changed his name he did away
[44:36] with his old book right according to
[44:38] romans 7 his old husband was put away in
[44:42] the silver forgiveness and god never saw
[44:44] you smitten right right
[44:46] god only saw a new birth right now god
[44:48] only saw where he come right how did god
[44:50] say he get away with his ishmael he did
[44:53] away with his ishmael nature and god
[44:55] said i said
[44:58] so now he's growing
[45:01] and maturing to hell himself and needing
[45:02] services so now they go to washington
[45:05] as it goes to church where they have
[45:07] grow up
[45:08] come a young boy maybe 12 years old so
[45:10] did god say off of this boy yeah
[45:13] now abraham
[45:15] faith knew how to handle any
[45:17] circumstances oh yeah because now this
[45:19] is a great tug for abraham to do they're
[45:22] going up here to worship after saying
[45:24] father i see the fire i see the night
[45:26] for words of sacrifice abraham made a
[45:28] mature show of god new description if
[45:30] god could change me back young if god
[45:33] could give me the son i thought i'm a
[45:35] dead i know that my god is able to raise
[45:38] this boy up out in the land of the ring
[45:40] we're going to go young and run worship
[45:43] and we will return because god said out
[45:45] of here in that seat i'm gonna call this
[45:47] generation right amen amen
[45:50] that's right
[45:51] right but his word was stolen his faith
[45:54] was so slow that abraham released this
[45:56] faith and created power stepped into
[45:58] existence
[46:13] let us look a lot
[46:15] he was nephew lot
[46:18] left the church
[46:19] come on me out right when he joined the
[46:21] two lord church
[46:26] abraham believed
[46:52] he went down there and when he separated
[46:54] from abraham
[47:05] he shouldn't have left my church if he
[47:07] wasn't the lady would have stayed here
[47:08] he would have made it we're leaving one
[47:10] church yeah amen and it's the body of
[47:12] jesus christ
[47:13] right but abraham just had the attitude
[47:16] that we had right abraham says here
[47:19] abraham said i love my nephew
[47:23] and i'm not letting go of you
[47:26] i'm not going to let circumstances
[47:28] influence my faith
[47:29] because we check we look at symptoms we
[47:32] look at things that people doing a lot
[47:33] of times and we make a decision but i
[47:35] don't see how they can be saved that one
[47:37] you need faith right because if you can
[47:39] see how they're gonna be saved
[47:40] everybody's being healed yeah
[47:42] but faith will be yours the human error
[47:44] faith will be young out of a mistake and
[47:47] faith look at the promise
[47:49] if you have faith for yourself take that
[47:51] same thing and hold over your little one
[47:53] all right
[47:54] abraham said i'm holding on for lot yeah
[47:57] right i know lot don't look good down
[47:59] there he got tied up in a worthy church
[48:01] he don't even believe the same way i do
[48:03] how do when you leave the message you
[48:04] don't believe the same way people do
[48:06] automatically scratch you off yeah
[48:08] i know a brother one time a message for
[48:10] a powerful guy he said a brother left
[48:12] his church
[48:14] went out in the world
[48:16] say come back
[48:19] and he said brother don't even come to
[48:20] my church
[48:22] he said your name is scratch off the
[48:23] book of life oh lord
[48:25] i'm the old god give me goodness
[48:28] lord actually come to the point that we
[48:30] make right we got the ability to tell
[48:32] god how to
[48:47] love i'm holding on yeah yeah so when
[48:49] the agent got ready to reveal abraham
[48:51] his secret tell everybody what do you
[48:53] need to say oh yeah abraham
[48:55] i'm going down to discourse talking

[48:59] yeah ain't never thought about it
[49:10] the spirit of reconciliation was moving
[49:13] on that's right honey i'm not letting go

[49:16] circumstance check out my children to go

[50:54] go yeah
[50:56] but they never haven't let martin go
[50:58] right let's look at the end results
[51:00] if abraham
[51:01] had a dark in the sea for luck
[51:04] abraham with himself by not holding on
[51:07] by faith he wasn't denied it the whole
[51:11] limit that jesus will come to you know
[51:13] jesus had to cut the roof and roof come
[51:16] over here and that old man come catch it
[51:18] and jesse come david right
[51:20] right
[51:31] all
[51:35] i right this go ahead now
[51:38] go to the message because this is
[51:40] i find more people faithful than this
[51:42] age
[51:44] and this is my statement
[51:46] i have made these statements in my own
[51:48] self
[51:49] we talk about faith we talk about
[51:50] perfect faith all right amen
[51:53] what
[51:54] do perfect maturity brings you to right
[51:56] to perfect understanding of perfect
[51:59] revelation of forgiveness
[52:02] that's one of the powerful things to do
[52:04] right you said that's easy to try
[52:08] come on it's easy to try yeah
[52:11] we got to learn
[52:12] what true forgiveness is right
[52:16] forgiveness is
[52:17] that god give me a revelation
[52:20] not only to forgive
[52:22] but he gives you a revelation to forgive
[52:25] it and forgive you right that's right
[52:27] human beings can't forget all right
[52:30] you're right with the holy ghost amen
[52:32] all right all right
[52:33] let me take let me let this use this
[52:35] real quick before i go
[52:37] full maturity bring you to the full
[52:39] revelation of forgiveness right right
[52:40] right adam was a fool between me right
[52:43] sure i had never had to suck a baby ball
[52:47] he never had a neighbor but all right he
[52:49] growled up with teeth
[52:53] man
[52:54] and he was a full grown man god gave me
[52:55] full grown authority
[52:57] i want you to do the earth i want you to
[52:59] keep it in line with the words
[53:02] if it get out of life you should do it
[53:04] put it by your life with the word
[53:06] right
[53:07] adam had full authority right and he
[53:11] broke that authority right not happening
[53:13] right exactly the bible say he was
[53:16] guilty of the transgression not adam
[53:18] adam knew what he was doing right
[53:20] let's look at the story
[53:22] a forward mature son of man
[53:24] for mature son of god walking there was
[53:26] supreme authority in his hand whatever
[53:28] you say on earth yeah i wish he would
[53:30] have spoke the devil that existed
[53:32] so i went ahead and got bald headed
[53:36] man my teeth wouldn't have never fell
[53:38] out
[53:39] we all would have been born perfect yeah
[53:41] but since adam didn't react as he should
[53:43] at that moment because he was in the
[53:45] condition we're here now
[53:47] yeah yeah all right
[53:49] but if there's a threat
[53:51] see if there's somebody saying i get it
[53:52] oh wow i'm gonna hear that word it
[53:55] sounded good when i was saying 30 and
[53:56] still time 50 start slightly different
[53:59] but here it is
[54:03] god gives him that he goes out
[54:06] and completely
[54:08] completely more herself yeah about wrong
[54:12] relationship right now
[54:14] adam could have not took her back right
[54:18] one for the church but he said she he
[54:20] should not have to go back right
[54:22] because she was already devoured right
[54:24] right yeah
[54:25] adam looked at his wife
[54:28] and adam says
[54:29] i love her and i'm gonna forgive her
[54:31] yeah regardless of the consequences
[54:33] right
[54:35] i'll be glad with the message yeah
[54:51] with that way
[54:52] adam looked him close and he said i love
[54:55] her she's bald in my mouth she's
[54:57] brushing my flesh
[54:58] all right all right yeah
[55:01] i know what it's gonna cost
[55:04] if i walk out and get her i'm going to
[55:06] sell all my sons and daughters
[55:09] in the because of sin and death right
[55:12] when adam did that adam left no way back
[55:14] no right right when he walked out and
[55:16] took into himself he took the whole
[55:19] human race and sold us into death that
[55:20] was you know right right how did he even
[55:23] know what we didn't know what he did
[55:25] here we wouldn't have been in time if he
[55:26] would have done that right
[55:29] but without him done that he crossed the
[55:31] council right
[55:32] because he loved him
[55:34] but when jesus looked down and so adam
[55:36] yeah yeah he loved his son
[55:39] he said no i love adam he's born about
[55:42] he's worried about work he's spirit of
[55:44] my spirit all right all right amen
[55:47] god couldn't destroy adam and remain god
[55:49] because he created the good news
[55:51] of god right so when they restrainted
[55:53] god to come down and pay a sacrifice so
[55:56] me and you when i could go to hell he
[55:59] came down and went to hell in our
[56:14] maturity bring you to their revelation
[56:16] not only could god forgive
[56:19] but god can forgive that's right
[56:21] so regardless
[56:23] when he said offer your only begotten
[56:25] son as and you say well ishmael with
[56:28] abraham's son but god can see it
[56:30] right romans 4 god never saw
[56:33] ishmael yeah god saw one son
[56:37] right because god put abraham all life
[56:40] in the sin of forgiveness god can
[56:42] remember what he'd done from that point
[56:44] right
[56:45] hey look at that
[56:46] so this is my statement
[56:48] because we all want to face this
[56:49] sometime of noon
[56:51] we're going to read a 100 adoption book
[56:53] pay 47
[56:55] because i made these statements before
[56:58] and this has been the statement
[57:00] he said i went after brother not long
[57:02] ago
[57:03] that went astray
[57:06] a young man said to me let the rest to
[57:08] go i have made you friends and let him
[57:10] go
[57:22] we don't let nobody go we hold on that
[57:24] ain't up to us to let him go that's up
[57:26] to god right so he says here and he said
[57:29] i said as long as i got as long as as
[57:31] long as i got hey
[57:33] no i said if i ever get to a place that
[57:36] my heart does not go with my brother
[57:38] it's time for me to go to the altar
[57:40] because i fell from grace all right
[57:43] well how many people's done backstage
[57:46] he said i said i go as long as i got
[57:49] breath in my body i catch him somewhere
[57:51] along the line yes sir i caught him and
[57:54] brought him back because i had a faith
[57:58] he said i'm not gonna let go right right
[58:00] i don't care what the consequences are
[58:02] i'm claiming my grandchildren i'm
[58:04] claiming my children i don't care what
[58:06] it looks like
[58:21] and i'm bringing this still closed
[58:24] over the years i traveled the most uh
[58:26] tropic
[58:28] over the years by god grace
[58:31] last 26 years been preaching the gospel
[58:35] when i find the most of
[58:37] all all of it
[58:40] it's so sad that i find people year
[58:42] after year
[58:43] that come up for the holy ghost and i go
[58:45] back to nature and they're coming up for
[58:46] the same thing right
[58:48] i said something is wrong right right
[58:50] right
[58:51] they come up in their prayers and i pray
[58:53] for them i brought sam a prayer for them
[58:54] brother david daniel back to prayer for
[58:57] them and then we shout all those
[58:58] services
[58:59] i got it i got it this time did you come
[59:01] back next year they didn't know
[59:04] i don't understand how you can have the
[59:07] holy ghost right then and don't have it
[59:09] a year later right right
[59:11] something is wrong with your revelation
[59:13] right man so i begin i begin to look at
[59:16] this thing i find it hard for people to
[59:19] stay safe
[59:25] but i was saying whether you want me and
[59:28] not not ain't saying that right
[59:30] you
[59:39] and i began to look and i found out the
[59:41] reason the bible said i like one thing
[59:43] in 1st john 3 21 say if my heart could
[59:45] give us not we have confidence for god
[59:50] so we have
[59:51] if our heart is condemned then we got
[59:54] we are ruled by a spiritual condemnation
[59:58] the condemnation is the spirit
[1:00:01] that hinders spiritual growth
[1:00:03] oh yeah
[1:00:04] in other words if you
[1:00:06] got condemnation something wrong right
[1:00:10] because paul you know it in that way we
[1:00:13] find here and i begin to say what's
[1:00:15] wrong
[1:00:16] what brings on condemnation
[1:00:19] i want you to listen close
[1:00:21] what brings his own condemnation why
[1:00:23] people get so beat down so condemned
[1:00:26] condemnation becomes the superior doubt
[1:00:29] in their mind yeah i'm so condemned
[1:00:32] yeah i'm so beat down
[1:00:34] why is it wild
[1:00:36] if i didn't have no bad luck i wouldn't
[1:00:37] have nothing at all
[1:00:39] condemnation
[1:00:40] yeah and i'm looking here i i got to be
[1:00:43] announced and it was in philippians 3
[1:00:45] and 3 when it said have no confidence in
[1:00:49] the flesh right that's right
[1:00:51] too many people and too busy trying to
[1:00:53] get this right but they get the heart
[1:00:55] right right right
[1:00:56] that's right and why you got people
[1:00:58] looking around i'm a little better than
[1:00:59] him
[1:01:00] hey yeah we more hold it there i tricked
[1:01:03] it and that's what you find out here in
[1:01:05] your own flesh is your own enemy right
[1:01:07] right i knew you found out you can't
[1:01:09] live right and you can't do what you
[1:01:11] thought you could do
[1:01:12] you know you beat down again right
[1:01:14] you're right back at the same order
[1:01:15] trying to get the holy ghost because you
[1:01:17] were looking at you not looking at the
[1:01:18] land right
[1:01:19] how do you guard it if god was in timber
[1:01:21] you don't put your covenant into
[1:01:22] yourself he would have put a mediator
[1:01:24] between god and man right amen he wanted
[1:01:27] you to get your heart and your faithful
[1:01:29] christ because if you don't look to him
[1:01:31] you'll never have the scripture to live
[1:01:32] right all right all right amen amen but
[1:01:35] he's gonna have no confidence in the
[1:01:36] flesh all right and too many people
[1:01:39] still trying to perfect the flood that's
[1:01:40] why we got all this legalism and random
[1:01:42] messages
[1:01:45] all this man right here and i ain't
[1:01:47] never done this i ain't never drunk i
[1:01:49] ain't never done it people you were born
[1:01:51] into sin shame in the new jesus it don't
[1:01:53] matter what you ain't done
[1:01:55] we all need grace
[1:01:57] yes
[1:02:02] we got this we don't put it on a level i
[1:02:04] ain't done
[1:02:19] have no covenant in the flesh i mean
[1:02:21] according to romans 7 that teaches us it
[1:02:24] teaches us and tell us if there is no
[1:02:27] good thing that's dwelling in my flesh
[1:02:30] all right all right that's right so
[1:02:32] condemnation is when you start putting
[1:02:34] your companies in you right and not in
[1:02:36] christ right right remember
[1:02:38] you gotta have your faith in what god
[1:02:41] done for you right all right not what
[1:02:42] you do for you right because if you
[1:02:44] could have did it you wouldn't need him
[1:02:45] to come you know that's right
[1:02:48] so now you say my brother jewel
[1:02:50] i got a problem i'm always a deal i got
[1:02:53] a problem i got condemnation in my life
[1:02:56] life and i i believe that it ain't no
[1:02:58] way to get around to condemnation i'm
[1:03:00] full of condemnation then you will miss
[1:03:02] the mark all right amen he said that how
[1:03:05] you doing because the contemplation
[1:03:07] control to you something is wrong with
[1:03:09] your spiritual growth that's right i am
[1:03:11] how do you know let me read the romans
[1:03:15] man 8. right man look at romans 8 real
[1:03:17] quick my clothes
[1:03:19] i'm not ready to parachute that's right
[1:03:21] hold on one minute
[1:03:24] condemnation
[1:03:26] watching romans 8 verse 1
[1:03:28] the condemnation has got you beat down
[1:03:31] and you say that's the way i am then you
[1:03:33] are saying that god has got power to
[1:03:36] move this fight right
[1:03:38] paul said
[1:03:40] there is death
[1:03:42] for now know what
[1:03:45] no condemnation to woo all right deal
[1:03:48] i'm putting myself in there
[1:03:50] which are in christ jesus who walked not
[1:03:53] after the what
[1:03:55] but i didn't know what
[1:03:56] we got
[1:04:10] so that paul said there is now
[1:04:12] no
[1:04:13] the problem is
[1:04:14] one word
[1:04:16] people don't understand with no meaning
[1:04:18] right yeah yeah all right
[1:04:20] you actually better withdraw me i got a
[1:04:22] grandson
[1:04:24] yeah then jeremiah he be doing something
[1:04:27] wrong
[1:04:28] and i said jeremiah did i tell you no
[1:04:30] not to do that
[1:04:31] and i said do you know what know me more
[1:04:34] he look at me and say yes sir i swear to
[1:04:36] me
[1:04:37] don't do it no more
[1:04:53] what no condemnation mean
[1:04:55] the knowledge but we ain't got the
[1:04:56] revelation to what it is right right
[1:04:58] that's why the church is so beat down
[1:05:00] and people so we get and people don't
[1:05:02] have no testimony because they ain't
[1:05:04] come to the knowledge right what is
[1:05:05] really the experience and knowledge what
[1:05:07] it is right
[1:05:09] i got another aggression then you're
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:12] and uh my wife would clean it my wife i
[1:05:14] went to oven to sell cleanses up so she
[1:05:16] had no and my little grandson he's about
[1:05:19] two years old he walks up to the stove
[1:05:22] and he says
[1:05:23] grandma
[1:05:24] it's hot
[1:05:26] she said yes it's hot i said no no don't
[1:05:28] touch it
[1:05:30] so now he gets the revelation and
[1:05:33] knowledge of what heart feels like yeah
[1:05:36] he you got the knowledge he was hot yeah
[1:05:38] but he never had an experience with what
[1:05:40] hot is right so he said grandma was hot
[1:05:43] she said don't touch it
[1:05:44] that's a no-no
[1:05:46] so when she was looking
[1:05:48] yeah he sneaked him and he touched that
[1:05:50] back
[1:05:52] not only do he got a knowledge
[1:05:54] he got his own personal revelation
[1:05:58] because his body almost breakdanced
[1:06:00] right
[1:06:30] 67 adoption bro
[1:06:33] this is the thing i'm hitting the market
[1:06:35] people we got to get our faith all right
[1:06:38] right right
[1:06:39] we're going to find ourselves in this
[1:06:41] edge
[1:06:42] people's falling away people's giving up
[1:06:57] for the son of god kick you up right now
[1:07:00] all right
[1:07:01] brother
[1:07:04] doctor blood paid 67 to the close
[1:07:07] he said now what does master teach to
[1:07:08] paul
[1:07:10] the first thing he knocked out
[1:07:12] is all the idea of falling away
[1:07:15] golden way is the idea right it's the
[1:07:18] idea that you put in your mind
[1:07:20] i'm not good enough to make a rapture
[1:07:22] yeah it's the idea that you put yourself
[1:07:24] you cut yourself short i said i'm a son
[1:07:28] of god i'm not gonna be there i got too
[1:07:30] many problems i got this brother i got
[1:07:33] that brother that is a idea yeah yeah
[1:07:37] i ain't gonna be good enough who told
[1:07:39] you that yeah but i'm gonna get myself
[1:07:41] how long we did how many years did it
[1:07:43] take you to figure out that you weren't
[1:07:44] gonna be good enough yeah that's right
[1:07:47] so god give a good looking at yourself
[1:07:48] and look at christ right amen if i could
[1:07:51] ever accept christ in my birthday and he
[1:07:54] come in my heart it ain't that i've been
[1:07:56] good enough he will make me good enough
[1:07:58] to be in the tragedy i will never be
[1:08:00] good enough
[1:08:02] you will never be good enough to even
[1:08:04] take your beauty right right
[1:08:06] that says the second christ
[1:08:08] he
[1:08:21] one day you say
[1:08:23] did they get you back at christmas go to
[1:08:25] church on wednesday sunday they probably
[1:08:29] two day three days
[1:08:32] all right yeah man
[1:08:41] this is
[1:08:42] the book
[1:08:43] that's not addressed to your
[1:08:44] evangelistic teacher but listen
[1:08:46] we do not we do not touch this on the
[1:08:48] field i bring this to the church paul is
[1:08:50] dreading it to the saints those that are
[1:08:52] called and reserved and filled and set
[1:08:54] aside and already
[1:08:58] and all in the holy ghost already in
[1:09:00] decaying the land yeah so now you say
[1:09:02] this is not addressed to a court of
[1:09:04] believers right because when you deal
[1:09:06] with call them believers you begin to
[1:09:07] say what are you going to be saying god
[1:09:09] got you saying hallelujah you are about
[1:09:11] to say hello i don't care what you do
[1:09:13] you know what to call the body and say
[1:09:14] well it don't matter if i drink yeah
[1:09:16] yeah ain't nobody right here god
[1:09:21] i want to tell you what
[1:09:23] you better read the rest of romans right
[1:09:25] it don't say to stay neutral it said to
[1:09:27] be conformed into the image of the
[1:09:29] living god so you got to change
[1:09:31] somewhere right let's
[1:09:39] homosexuality
[1:09:40] and what his philosophy was if i'm a son
[1:09:43] of god i'm going to be saved anyway no
[1:09:45] if you're a son of god you're going to
[1:10:00] hey
[1:10:07] you cannot preach this
[1:10:09] to call the people right because they're
[1:10:10] looking for a way well if you're a son
[1:10:12] of god you're going to be there if you
[1:10:14] are a son shutting down you're not heard
[1:10:16] from your thing happening you don't like
[1:10:17] the things of the world right in the
[1:10:19] world and you are changing to the image
[1:10:21] of the living room
[1:10:27] and so here i am to worship
[1:10:29] i'm doing something
[1:10:31] see
