[19:40] everybody's called to walk in Christ but
[19:43] this is the age to talk about the called
[19:47] us to glory see to be glorified the
[19:51] glory and then called us to virtue all
[19:55] right
[19:56] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[19:58] great and precious promises that by
[20:00] these you might be partakers of the

[20:30] unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord
[20:34] Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord
[20:38] at his blessing to the reading of the
[20:41] word yeah yeah I pray that this
[20:48] morning's message helps you to
[20:49] understand some of the things that we're
[20:52] talking about and you know what we're
[20:55] trying to do and seeing that you know
[21:00] the main point to come from that message
[21:02] I'll try not to back up too far but to
[21:05] see that by the new birth you come to
[21:10] this position called faith the new birth
[21:14] all right little Brennaman say how faith
[21:17] and be born again because that's the
[21:20] born-again believer that's a position
[21:21] all right now that faith puts us in to
[21:26] the body of Christ by the new birth
[21:29] eternal life in our soul all right now
[21:33] here was the point this morning bringing
[21:34] it up see all right that the new birth
[21:38] by that new birth the born-again
[21:41] experience giving eternal life to the
[21:44] soul made God a dwelling place to dwell
[21:50] in to each one of us all right now he's
[21:55] always took and had a dwelling place of
[21:58] the tenth headed in the tabernacle he
[22:01] had it in the different things and then
[22:04] it finally came unto Jesus Christ walk
[22:07] upon this earth as the tabernacle of God
[22:12] the body that God dwells in all right
[22:16] He gave His life to her that that life
[22:21] could come back in you and I because
[22:23] that was not even though that was a
[22:25] fulfillment of his desires in the
[22:29] beginning was to come down and dwell
[22:32] with mankind not just creating us and
[22:37] then something happens and then he
[22:38] chooses it now he always had that plan
[22:41] because the plan and purpose of God is
[22:44] fulfilled in Jesus Christ on earth he
[22:47] had a desire to be Savior healer
[22:49] deliverer etc all right those were there
[22:52] he never received those attributes as he
[22:57] come into life he had those attributes
[22:59] to be all of that all right then it had
[23:02] to be displayed so he had to come to a
[23:05] place that dart was his body the eternal
[23:10] I mean the the natural physical
[23:13] body of the Lord Jesus Christ became
[23:16] then the body for God to live in
[23:19] he was borned Emmanuel God with us and
[23:23] soul he was eternal in spirit he was
[23:26] eternal that's words of the prophet all
[23:29] right but the body was not eternal
[23:31] because it had a beginning not that it
[23:34] it was sinful or anything it had a
[23:37] beginning anything has a beginning has
[23:39] to have an ending to it or it has to be
[23:42] made eternal alright so then that body
[23:45] that he was dwelling in he walked in
[23:48] that body upon this earth he brought
[23:51] that body under subjection to the one
[23:56] that was inside of him all right until
[24:00] he come to doing only the will of the
[24:02] Father he comes through the adoptions he
[24:05] comes through the the different stages
[24:07] and brought him out to the position to
[24:10] be you know God Emmanuel here upon earth
[24:15] all right but that was not the finish of
[24:17] Holly had in his mind that's that's the
[24:20] thoughts of mankind you know that that
[24:23] he'd come to do this that's good it is
[24:25] right he come to do that but he had
[24:27] other thoughts he had a healer Savior
[24:29] deliverer you know and all of the
[24:32] attributes alright so he made a way in
[24:35] that person we called Jesus the flesh
[24:38] man to be our brother to where he could
[24:42] give his life then it could come back
[24:44] and dwell in you and I giving us the new
[24:48] birth all right now that would make
[24:52] God's dwelling place or a tabernacle to
[24:55] be into you and on as we were ending up
[24:58] the message talking about that we are
[25:01] the body of Jesus Christ upon earth now
[25:04] because he doesn't need a body his his
[25:08] body is laying on the throne there in
[25:10] heaven not I don't think he's laying
[25:12] lifeless you know I've never thought
[25:14] like that he's got other things to be
[25:17] doing he's up there preparing for us a
[25:20] place to go to according to the
[25:22] scriptures alright that he's preparing a
[25:24] home or a future home or
[25:26] now but the body is not here on earth
[25:29] physically because if it was then that
[25:33] would be as the Prophet said the end of
[25:36] all things and you can't have that
[25:37] because see even the body of Jesus
[25:40] Christ does not come to earth he comes
[25:44] downward and we meet him in the air
[25:48] right all right then we go to be with
[25:51] him then we all come back to earth
[25:53] together into the millennial reign all
[25:56] right now see but that new birth then
[26:00] was provided a way you and I could
[26:04] become the sons and daughters of the
[26:05] Living God to accepting Jesus Christ as
[26:08] our Savior bringing life into our soul
[26:12] making us that place all right but
[26:14] that's not the finish that's not the
[26:18] finish of all things that was the point
[26:20] that he had that he wanted and desired
[26:23] but he that was not to finish the finish
[26:26] is to bring this people God wants this
[26:31] people to become so much under
[26:33] subjection to him until we will walk off
[26:37] this earth in a change of the body all
[26:40] right now that's laying before us that's
[26:43] always been there and watched that as we
[26:47] attempt a little bit this afternoon but
[26:51] we'll pick it up next Sunday more to
[26:53] talk about the fact of God and how that
[26:57] he can bring these things to pice in you
[27:02] and I all right now see he's built the
[27:05] temple he built the tabernacle built all
[27:08] the time build a body come and dwelled
[27:10] in the body gave His life to come back
[27:13] into you and I that puts it in a
[27:15] beautiful position by the new birth but
[27:18] that put us into a situation to her that
[27:22] we just had eternal life in our soul
[27:25] because our body and spirit is not
[27:28] eternal the new birth is not the birth
[27:30] of the of the body or the spirit is the
[27:33] birth of the soul all right so that was
[27:35] not to finish according to the plan and
[27:39] of God of Christ mister God revealed
[27:41] that he had a plan and purpose that was
[27:45] - he was going to see it achieved that
[27:49] was to come into a people to word that
[27:52] he could have the preeminence in that
[27:55] people and could walk in the people in a
[28:01] in a body that he would have the
[28:05] finality of the finishing up of were
[28:08] that we would come to that place cause
[28:11] you see he went through the place of
[28:14] being made eternal his body remember was
[28:17] not eternal he went to a place that it
[28:20] was eternal so then that leaves a
[28:23] position - you and I are are are behind
[28:26] a little bit we need in other words what
[28:28] we need to do is I springing out it to N
[28:31] we need to try to come to the place that
[28:35] he can take over and take us into
[28:38] eternity all right now so then thinking
[28:42] about that we are the temple of God and
[28:46] we are the people that the end of all
[28:50] things according to the Bible is come
[28:52] upon you and I to bring us to the finish
[28:55] of it all and the finish of it is is God
[28:59] coming and living in you and I you said
[29:02] but I just don't see how that that we
[29:04] can do that that's the problem
[29:05] you're like Eve you're saying it can't
[29:07] be done and I agree with you it can't be
[29:10] done we can't do it so then the statute
[29:15] of a perfect man is building exactly
[29:17] what it is it's building Jesus Christ in
[29:20] you it's not building you and you we
[29:24] just get another you and that would be
[29:26] too good huh but it's coming to a place
[29:29] to work that he will live in the people
[29:32] now listen brother Brian said that God
[29:36] wanted to prove to Satan that this bride
[29:40] would not fall like Eve fell in the
[29:43] beginning all right and see them to do
[29:46] that he's put us through the test
[29:47] putting us through all of these
[29:49] situations and things that we thank you
[29:52] notice
[29:53] in this morning we said will ain't
[29:54] nothing going on if you had what you
[29:56] think you got then something big going
[29:57] on well I wonder how he felt when he
[30:01] walked in life
[30:03] whenever turned ever movie made was
[30:07] somebody trying to trap him trick him
[30:10] harm him do all of those things you know
[30:15] see we only look at the glory of what
[30:17] happened
[30:18] you know our dead was raised or sick was
[30:22] healed or something you know we only
[30:24] look at those things as because we're
[30:28] putting it upon that but we need to put
[30:30] it up on say seeing what the word says
[30:33] you and I are to be all right and if we
[30:37] are to be him made manifest then how is
[30:41] that to take place we have the message
[30:44] to tell us how we have the things as
[30:47] we'll get for Canada and see then we'll
[30:49] get to a little of it but what we need
[30:52] to do is just to yield ourselves to that
[30:56] one that's within us because he yielded
[31:00] himself to the one the body that he
[31:03] dwelt in yielded over to the one that
[31:06] was within him you know I mean he wanted
[31:09] to come off the cross right he prayed
[31:12] you know not if it be thy will he wanted
[31:16] to get off of that cross he was a human
[31:18] being but yet he said and with
[31:20] nevertheless no thing he's so yielded
[31:24] himself until he yielded himself to
[31:26] death right Robin
[31:30] they come death come up on him and then
[31:32] he was brought up resurrected and
[31:35] changed and that body was made eternal
[31:39] okay now in that being then he became
[31:43] the total dwelling place of Almighty God
[31:47] but that that he became is what he wants
[31:51] us to become right we're going to become
[31:57] right here whether we think it can take
[32:01] place or not I've done no business of
[32:04] mine I just take the Bible we are to
[32:06] come
[32:07] right here somebody will why can't we
[32:10] say we're them somebody's going to be
[32:12] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[32:15] eye why can't we believe that we're the
[32:18] one see we've got our eyes our minds set
[32:22] on higher things instead of putting it
[32:27] upon what God says and let it be simply
[32:30] to walk in that he walked each day he
[32:34] didn't have to get up
[32:36] he's always try to illustrate it Jesus
[32:39] didn't have to get up said well I'm God
[32:40] so I guess I better act like him today
[32:42] no he just went about his day of being
[32:46] who he was all right we don't have to
[32:50] proud a matter of fact or something you
[32:52] remember that in the statue of a perfect
[32:54] man and many times would he saying it we
[32:56] don't have to try to manufacture
[32:57] something all we got to do is just let
[33:00] him take care of it there's the secret
[33:03] of the whole time yes for brother Dale
[33:05] you ain't told me what I can do then
[33:08] nothing we can do the only thing we can
[33:11] do is believe what God has set through
[33:15] the prophet and you know yourself words
[33:18] that I go to and all of that that we're
[33:21] gonna come to a change of the body yeah
[33:23] this body's gonna put on the portal and
[33:26] mortal life right here because it has
[33:30] yielded itself to God we must just yield
[33:34] our bodies let God take care of it
[33:36] let him take care of all the things the
[33:38] Prophet said it'd be automatic right not
[33:42] just automatically done because that
[33:44] where people don't know it's to be
[33:47] automatic it's to be that we yield to
[33:50] him we surrender to him
[33:54] our being to where he can come inside
[33:58] and then come outward through us all
[34:01] right remember the other day the message
[34:04] we were bringing how that the virtues
[34:06] will be made manifest through your
[34:10] spirit out to the body to where that
[34:16] mankind can see
[34:19] you know that part all right it'll have
[34:22] to be something that you and I are going
[34:25] through all right now we are a triune
[34:28] being just like he was a Tryon being and
[34:31] he wants us to yield ourselves to him to
[34:36] her that he can manifest itself through
[34:39] us to bring us to the place that we need
[34:43] to be all right now as I was saying get
[34:46] the point now the new birth in the soul
[34:50] makes that soul to be God's vessel or a
[34:53] place for him to dwell but he's wanting
[34:56] that to be brought out into the body
[35:00] yeah
[35:01] all right now you tell me what else it
[35:03] is I'm just serious I'm not not
[35:06] sarcastic or - I'm just putting it plain
[35:09] you tell me what else it is why is this
[35:13] or one of the other one here no I'm just
[35:15] making it plain as I can to you what I
[35:18] believe I believe God wants for people
[35:21] that will just yield himself to him not
[35:25] try to do all of it but just become what
[35:28] he wants us to be how problems you're
[35:31] gonna have problems all your life you
[35:34] don't think Jesus had problems the
[35:41] Christian that's just part of a
[35:42] Christian how many times it Paul said he
[35:44] was in the fountain of the deep that he
[35:46] was bait not three times
[35:48] Spira one rod which would have killed
[35:50] him you know and different time and yet
[35:55] he was right in the middle of the will
[35:56] of God
[36:01] if anybody was yielding itself to God to
[36:04] let the inside man look leading was the
[36:07] Apostle Paul as far as us human beings
[36:09] right and see then it's not a to being a
[36:15] Christian is not being well are we just
[36:17] boy they're nothing don't bother us
[36:19] we're Christians with us no many are the
[36:22] afflictions of the righteous put the
[36:23] Lord lead us out of them all how can you
[36:25] go through child training in adoption
[36:28] without being going through child
[36:30] training you know right how can we be
[36:35] there see see we'd say what do you
[36:41] expect or what does God expect us to do
[36:44] all right just what he done he brought
[36:50] his body under subjection to the one
[36:54] that was inside of him and that's all
[36:58] he's expecting you and I to do God wants
[37:02] us to get his nature dwelling throughout
[37:07] our entire being come on now now you're
[37:11] getting a statue of a perfect man with
[37:13] right because we're too pro-gun potaters
[37:15] as we read of His divine nature how do
[37:18] you become partakers of His divine
[37:19] nature by letting that nature come and
[37:25] dwell in each one of us yeah but I just
[37:27] don't see we can make it well alright I
[37:31] agree we we can't but if we can yield to
[37:35] him and let him take care of things at
[37:39] least we can see a little hope there or
[37:42] sliver as we talk about it right now
[37:45] listen what I want you to think about
[37:49] today this afternoon is one thing
[37:57] everybody in the body of Christ is not
[38:03] the same because it wouldn't be a body I
[38:07] mean that's one natural point right a
[38:09] body got hands feet hands you know head
[38:13] body I'm different parts and everybody's
[38:17] not required what everybody else is all
[38:21] right so now those down to the ages
[38:27] right the disciples had these virtues
[38:31] your prophet said it right had to leave
[38:33] a little not from God they had these
[38:35] virtues all right
[38:37] but then the channel our way for that to
[38:41] come into being Satan come in and then
[38:45] wrote a dad and took it away all right
[38:47] now so then you find down through the
[38:51] ages the people wouldn't have the
[38:54] presence of these virtues in time to
[38:57] degree you can have this or you can have
[38:59] that you can be up and down one because
[39:01] you can have natural virtues you can
[39:04] have blood around said we have two
[39:06] different kinds of faith two different
[39:09] kinds of virtues two different kinds of
[39:11] knowledge all right and he said people
[39:14] how these things without even having a
[39:17] new birth you know people that are good
[39:19] neighbors they're good people they'd do
[39:21] anything in the world for you you know
[39:23] they're just this is just everything but
[39:26] they're not Christians and they don't
[39:29] even claim to be they're just human
[39:31] beings well if that be true that they
[39:34] could attain that by just natural things
[39:36] what about you and I with the eternal
[39:39] life within us and the ability to
[39:44] achieve what God wants alright now we've
[39:49] been through this over over over I'm
[39:52] gonna mention it and then this pull back
[39:54] and keep on going
[39:56] alright we have the right I mean we have
[40:01] the God has a plan and a purpose God has
[40:07] a way that he's going to do things
[40:09] now and by doing it the way he does it
[40:13] it takes away from you and on and gets
[40:16] us out of the way all right he knows
[40:18] what he wants he knows how to bring into
[40:22] pice what he wants all right now he
[40:25] didn't leave us blindly as I said now
[40:31] down through the ages
[40:33] it didn't take this this was not removed
[40:36] from the Bible of second Peter you know
[40:39] this taken out of the Bible and nobody
[40:41] didn't have it no but the way to attain
[40:45] unto that was lost now we'll get to it
[40:50] when we get over into some of it with
[40:53] knowledge in a different things like a
[40:55] especially in knowledge to see how that
[40:59] mankind has removed you remember where
[41:03] it says it on virtue he says the reason
[41:07] we don't have this
[41:08] he said because people don't teach it
[41:10] anymore well you said well how would
[41:16] that take it away because you're not
[41:18] going to try to attain them to it if you
[41:20] don't know it's dark I'm asking you a
[41:23] point do you believe that the virtues of
[41:25] 2nd Peter are required no requirement or
[41:32] do we just gonna have hazard Li float
[41:33] alone well what do you mean I go to
[41:35] church I do this I I pay my tithes I do
[41:38] everything what else you want me to be I
[41:40] just want you to die to yourself that's
[41:45] what a man said I start work one day you
[41:47] know and he was kidding Fred Hooper's
[41:50] what I think
[41:51] anyhow there was a time when Jim Jones
[41:55] that took those people down you know and
[41:56] they all drank the poison and paint and
[41:59] they was kind of making light of us you
[42:01] know as Colts and and one of them said
[42:03] to Blues Fred or somebody you know they
[42:06] said well you know there's the Sam ever
[42:09] tried to get you to kill yourself he
[42:11] said ever service he said ever service
[42:18] he preached you said all he wants me to
[42:20] do is die to myself
[42:23] well that's a good point all right but
[42:27] you see now listen the way was lost let
[42:34] me say it in another way the faith of
[42:37] the fathers was lost the revelation of
[42:43] the Apostles and things died and went
[42:46] into the ground will you follow that
[42:48] channel all right and see that was the
[42:51] stature of a perfect man was what they
[42:53] were teaching and that went down because
[42:58] mankind stopped teaching that it was a
[43:01] requirement because that would be the
[43:05] way see the church would tell you today
[43:07] you go to the church and and they say
[43:09] well we'll watch the requirement we
[43:11] don't have to do nothing just come pay
[43:13] your tithe be a good person will
[43:14] everything's fine
[43:16] yeah well that's a good well and all
[43:18] like that but God has requirements and
[43:24] we're going to how to reach those
[43:26] requirements you know why would the
[43:31] statue of a perfect man be in the Bible
[43:32] if it was not first not required for it
[43:36] to happen right why would God write it
[43:41] in the word if it's not required all
[43:43] right number two if it's in the book
[43:46] it's required right number one you see
[43:51] it number one if God required it number
[43:55] two it's in the book all right if it's
[43:58] in the book God requires it how are we
[44:02] going to get out of here what's going to
[44:04] bring a change what's going to bring a
[44:05] rapture we've had 50 years since the
[44:08] prophets going you know they're going
[44:09] away as a prophet
[44:14] you don't think see that's why you come
[44:18] up with the ideas and thoughts of saying
[44:20] we're all artists don't see nothing
[44:22] going home we had more back yonder in
[44:24] Pentecost and we got now what you want
[44:26] to go back there come on what would be
[44:34] the difference in Pentecost and the true
[44:36] Pentecost now I'm a firm believer in
[44:38] Pentecost
[44:39] I'm a firm believer in a true
[44:42] Pentecostal experience i am i believe
[44:47] justification same case in the baptism
[44:49] of the holy ghost bringing the new birth
[44:50] is a Pentecostal experience
[44:53] I'm just not a Pentecostal there's a
[44:57] difference between a Pentecostal blowing
[45:00] it all out two horns and all of the
[45:02] things and doing no type of thing than
[45:04] to be a true born-again believer to me
[45:08] there's a vast difference in the two
[45:09] well I would happier back Doc's will go
[45:12] on back side no problem yeah no trouble
[45:17] it's going back if that's what you want
[45:21] but if we want to go on to a change of
[45:23] the body then let's hang around it might
[45:25] happen but it'll happen cause somebody
[45:29] catches the word from the Prophet in the
[45:34] things to bring all right I didn't mean
[45:37] to go this way but we're going with it
[45:39] we know what that according to 327 of
[45:42] the church age book that this messenger
[45:45] of Malachi 4 is to do two things 1 turn
[45:48] the hearts of the children back to the
[45:50] faith of the fathers to reveal those
[45:54] seven thunders which is the revelations
[45:56] contained in the seven seals it will be
[45:58] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[46:01] that literally turns the bride back now
[46:04] I'm perfect exactly word for a word from
[46:07] what the Prophet is saying all right so
[46:10] what do we need we need to fight for the
[46:12] father the statue of perfect man is the
[46:14] faith of the father all right so if we
[46:17] need to fight the father how do we get
[46:18] to fight to the Father
[46:25] come on us just like the Prophet said we
[46:27] say we need virtue how alert you well
[46:30] how you gonna get versa
[46:31] oh we need knowledge okay we can read
[46:35] that but that's not hitting knowledge
[46:39] none of those virtues are natural things
[46:43] they're the virtues of Almighty God
[46:47] all right so then God has given us the
[46:51] way he brought us a prophet
[46:56] come on to fulfil Malachi 4 all right
[47:01] that Melek high 4 is to turn the hearts
[47:04] of the children back to the faith of the
[47:06] fathers is that right
[47:07] John the Baptist turned it one way this
[47:10] end-time has to turn it back to another
[47:13] and technically taught John never turned
[47:16] nothing the we use those terminologies
[47:20] and words as we're discussing there at
[47:22] lunchtime just a little see we say John
[47:25] turned to miss what no John did actually
[47:27] turned ton didn't even have a message
[47:31] all John was it introduced Jesus Christ
[47:34] that was the faith of the fathers that
[47:38] stood the faces of us he introduced the
[47:40] faith of the Father he didn't turn it
[47:42] it's just our terminologies our words
[47:45] that John turned them this away and then
[47:48] this mess is gonna turn them back that
[47:50] away no Jesus Christ was that see what
[47:57] are you looking for brother I'm looking
[47:59] for Jesus Christ become visible among a
[48:01] bride and do in the end time what he
[48:03] promised to do if I can find the promise
[48:06] may I quote the Prophet this one used to
[48:08] hit me hard he said if you can find the
[48:10] promise in God's word he said you can
[48:13] call him on the scene now if you need
[48:14] this and I'll be glad to get it for you
[48:16] he said and if he don't produce what he
[48:18] said said you can call him a liar now
[48:22] that's a direct quote
[48:24] you can call God a liar if he won't come
[48:26] on the scene and do what he said it well
[48:28] I prayed and he didn't do it how do you
[48:31] prost him wrong
[48:32] you don't approach God as a demand
[48:36] there's no such thing don't demand God
[48:39] to do anything remember I told you about
[48:41] the guy there at work he said this is
[48:43] Pentecostal brother he said he said I I
[48:47] quit trying to do command the Lord I
[48:53] just started commanding the devil no
[48:55] excuse me he said I quit trying to
[48:57] command the devil
[48:58] I started commanding the Lord I said
[49:01] what he said yeah the Bible where it
[49:03] says commands you me I said that don't
[49:06] mean you command him I said that means
[49:09] you asked him and that's what he said he
[49:14] said I quit commanding the devil I done
[49:16] got over that said I started commanding
[49:19] God I went I walked away and I didn't
[49:28] have much more to do with that feller
[49:30] because I figured that if he had already
[49:33] got through with commanding the devil he
[49:35] was a whole lot ahead of me because I
[49:37] hadn't got to that place right and I
[49:40] know number two I certainly wasn't gonna
[49:43] try to command God so when it says
[49:45] commands you me it doesn't mean command
[49:47] like I demand you do it come on
[49:51] may I quote your prophet when it
[49:55] happened with the the little girl what
[49:59] was that something happened anyhow he
[50:00] said he had told us the lady he said
[50:04] you're not going to die
[50:07] and she told her mother remember she
[50:10] said mom I'm going home said yeah we're
[50:12] going home to Marco got to you
[50:13] she said no I'm not going home I'm gonna
[50:16] die run around him when that was
[50:19] finished up he said to God he said God
[50:21] you owe me an answer he said because you
[50:24] told me to tell her you told me to tell
[50:29] her she's healed and I did and said you
[50:32] owe me an answer he said you don't do
[50:34] that with God he said he let him pout it
[50:38] out for about three months then he come
[50:42] to him and he said now I'll explain it
[50:43] to you did you go back and check said
[50:46] she's supposed to died like a year
[50:48] before and a place where she'd almost
[50:50] drowned it and said I gave her that time
[50:53] to extend her life the worst he could
[50:55] get straighten up and become a Christian
[50:57] then he took her off don't try to
[50:58] command God on anything ask him maybe
[51:05] we're not doing this stage but this age
[51:08] is turned but we didn't command our
[51:10] momma's and daddies do thing now all of
[51:15] us here today told enough to know we
[51:18] didn't command our parents you tried to
[51:23] commend my mom I seen her whooped my
[51:25] brother when he was 18 years old with a
[51:28] metal ring off of a wooden barrel and
[51:30] straightened it out and let him have it
[51:32] you didn't play with mom you didn't
[51:38] command her she took care of you okay
[51:42] but listen jerks getting to the point
[51:47] the faith of the fathers was lost to the
[51:50] ages because mankind never taught it
[51:53] that's the main thing it wasn't taught
[51:56] of mankind it we need these type words
[51:59] it talked now that we need these things
[52:00] even after coming into the message even
[52:03] after the Prophet telling us we need it
[52:05] if you read statue of a perfect man you
[52:07] heard him in there say these things are
[52:09] required well maybe you didn't read it
[52:14] something went wrong were you reading he
[52:16] said it's required like I said if it's
[52:18] in the book it's required
[52:21] right see then we know how to do we've
[52:27] got the right channel the profit brought
[52:30] the message the seven thunders sounded
[52:33] through the prophets message right and
[52:36] those are to be the things that
[52:38] literally turn us back yeah those are to
[52:46] be the things to literally turn us back
[52:48] now there's another stage to that that
[52:50] I'll withhold until Sunday there's
[52:55] another part of that that we're turning
[52:56] down God has placed within our hands his
[53:03] truth he has give us the message he has
[53:07] give us everything that he said he would
[53:11] give us to fulfill the job but why have
[53:16] we not attained could it believe could
[53:21] it be that we're doubting his way I'll
[53:26] leave it to her let you think on that
[53:29] because brother Branham was talking in
[53:31] the statue of a perfect man and he said
[53:34] these people wasn't required what these
[53:37] people was required come on read it see
[53:42] each one of these ages has got their own
[53:44] part of the word alright but each age is
[53:48] not required what the other one is
[53:49] required right because they're
[53:53] individuals just like all of us
[53:56] individuals I said a moment ago we're
[53:58] hands were feet we're eyes were we're
[54:00] not all required to be the same but we
[54:05] are required to yield ourselves to be
[54:07] God's children all right down through
[54:11] the ages
[54:13] he brought his church up the same way
[54:15] that he brings the people up so Peters
[54:18] said here temperance patience garland
[54:20] there's no than the love of God the Holy
[54:22] Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy
[54:24] Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism
[54:27] of the Holy Ghost and you've got all
[54:29] these virtues sealed in sealed in you
[54:33] then God lives in a tabernacle called
[54:36] the building the living tabernacle of
[54:39] the Living God's dwelling place right
[54:41] where we ended this morning what is his
[54:43] dwelling place now a body thou has
[54:46] prepared me what's he working on me and
[54:48] you to bring us to a place he's already
[54:52] given us in the material number why kept
[54:57] emphasizing they see Solomon didn't have
[54:59] to worry about getting material God had
[55:03] already seen to that even though he
[55:07] turns around to David and he says David
[55:09] you can't build me a house and do can
[55:14] hook up my feet hurt just go if that's
[55:17] the way you're gonna be about it just go
[55:18] ahead then we'll let Solomon y'all live
[55:20] together no the very minute that he
[55:24] found out he wasn't gonna build a house
[55:27] he calls in all of his people remember
[55:30] work and start saying we're gonna need
[55:32] this we're gonna need that David was
[55:35] more in control of building that the
[55:38] temple than Solomon was Solomon's just
[55:41] assembled what David brought together
[55:43] all right and see that's where it should
[55:46] be with each one of us instead of
[55:48] getting our feelings upset because God
[55:51] would say something to it
[55:52] what Wren said oh no it's better than a
[55:54] yes a lot of times you ask God for
[55:58] something he says no he's child training
[56:02] I like my brother Gary Atkins he likes
[56:05] it and brother who was it brother
[56:08] sister I'll get it in a minute buddy huh
[56:11] she Curtis or
[56:12] she if she had a spoon about that long a
[56:16] little paddle it was back time and them
[56:21] kids didn't fool huh because you get
[56:24] that little paddle and she'd take care
[56:27] of it brother Gary says she knows how to
[56:29] raise children
[56:30] he said don't want knows better how to
[56:32] raise children is God because he knows
[56:35] how to raise us he's got to say no to us
[56:37] I remember what I've done I've told you
[56:40] over and over and brought them old
[56:41] priests in 60 71 he preached at you a
[56:46] perfect man
[56:47] I asked him I said brother vote now on
[56:48] no one time how do I get these virtues
[56:53] it's a requirement that I've got to have
[56:55] them so I've been dealing with this for
[56:57] a long time a requirement of getting the
[57:01] virtues and it was like in 81 or 82 when
[57:06] God spoke to me and he said those words
[57:08] that this messenger of malachi forced to
[57:11] do these two things if you're going to
[57:14] get these mergers there's got to be
[57:15] those seven thunders yes but brother
[57:21] tell
[57:22] only the Prophet can come up with the
[57:25] thunders I believe this prophets already
[57:28] thundered forth God spoke through a man
[57:33] to you and I to tell us all the things
[57:36] that we have need of well I just don't
[57:40] know where that will do it or not well
[57:42] then what are you don't going to do it
[57:44] with right you don't think that that's
[57:49] God's way of doing it
[57:51] well I'll give you the pulpit tell us
[57:54] how to do it we've had 50 years
[57:56] stumbling like an ear come on get up
[58:00] here tell us how to get these virtues
[58:02] because according to the Prophet we got
[58:04] to have them and he says they're going
[58:08] to rapture we got album no I'm not
[58:17] sarcastic hey for the water I'm just
[58:19] truthful I want to get out of here
[58:20] hey I'm 78 and I'm wearing out wonderful
[58:25] for God to do that and I thank God for
[58:27] all that he has done for me and how he
[58:29] keeps on doing but I want to get out of
[58:31] here you know and he's already told us
[58:37] how to do it he said these the Prophet
[58:41] America forced to do it when we believe
[58:43] the prophet of Malachi 4
[58:47] but the Prophet Malachi 4 told us some
[58:50] other things that we'll get to all right
[58:53] but these wasn't required what these
[58:55] were required everybody ain't required
[58:59] down through the ages they wasn't
[59:00] required to how these things they were
[59:03] required to be Christians and do the
[59:06] best that could do for the day an hour
[59:08] why cause Malachi 4 had not been
[59:11] restored
[59:12] look how for was not restored down
[59:15] through the ages you really was falling
[59:18] away but there was no restoration down
[59:23] through that because they kept falling
[59:25] away from the word gradually coming back
[59:29] to bringing things for the truth all
[59:32] right but now think about it if an age
[59:37] is not required something then God just
[59:39] moves on he winks at them lets them go
[59:42] through the ages and thought he doesn't
[59:45] beat us to death about the reason we
[59:46] don't out like if he don't require it
[59:50] but then when he comes along to require
[59:52] it then he tells us hey it's time to do
[59:55] it now it's time for somebody to do
[59:58] something I mean we folks we done run
[1:00:02] out of time you younger ones can say
[1:00:05] well we've got time but you ain't got
[1:00:07] much time huh see these ages they come
[1:00:13] down through that and as they did
[1:00:15] according to the prophet then on the
[1:00:18] statue of a perfect man what does he say
[1:00:25] look at number two attaching a perfect
[1:00:28] man you get it these people who died in
[1:00:32] here are depending and waiting on us all
[1:00:38] right these people died in here are
[1:00:42] depending and way doing us well so this
[1:00:46] church has got to come to perfection
[1:00:51] in order to bring the resurrection no
[1:01:01] you need anymore the Prophet just told
[1:01:05] you somebody's got to come to the
[1:01:08] perfection
[1:01:09] well the hint and homeless can be
[1:01:10] perfect I've heard that's a long time
[1:01:13] sick of it
[1:01:16] my lord we heard that in the Baptist
[1:01:19] Church I didn't know new doctor than the
[1:01:21] message we ain't all perfect we all
[1:01:24] forgive one
[1:01:25] I remember that tag number and I hate
[1:01:27] him I read tags on cars and they're on
[1:01:30] the back of a tag one day and it said
[1:01:31] I'm I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven I
[1:01:36] said they don't even know don't go home
[1:01:38] look up the word forgiven the word
[1:01:40] forgiven this means it's wiped away and
[1:01:42] ain't nothing I okay and their souls
[1:01:47] under the altar waiting for this church
[1:01:49] to come to its perfection that when
[1:01:54] Christ does come and this church you see
[1:01:57] is coming smaller and the minority these
[1:02:00] refers to the chalkboard and owner it's
[1:02:03] the same kind of a ministry that this
[1:02:05] left because when the headstone comes
[1:02:07] back it's got a little pocket little
[1:02:10] flames at Cal for it to go the church
[1:02:12] has got to be home to fit we'll get into
[1:02:16] that I don't want to cover that too much
[1:02:19] on this this to the point that they
[1:02:22] without us cannot be made perfect all
[1:02:24] right now listen then I say it again
[1:02:27] like I did a minute ago they without us
[1:02:30] could not be made perfect all right now
[1:02:33] if there's on us there's a possibility
[1:02:36] for them to be made perfect
[1:02:40] right if there's a people that can
[1:02:43] receive God's Word there's a possibility
[1:02:45] that this thing can take place do you
[1:02:48] not believe that you're part of it what
[1:02:51] are you here for Phillip you now we've
[1:02:57] got a job to do we've got to become what
[1:03:02] God wants you to become and listen look
[1:03:06] at number the bottom part of number
[1:03:08] three okay but each age then we got it
[1:03:16] now get back up to the other about the
[1:03:21] governor 357 there you go and the whole
[1:03:28] stature of your being is governed and
[1:03:31] controlled by these things nice talking
[1:03:33] about the virtues right is that what
[1:03:36] he's talking about in the message the
[1:03:37] virtues that's what it's to be now look
[1:03:39] but it cannot completely completely be
[1:03:43] completely controlled till it completely
[1:03:46] possesses these qualities now what's the
[1:03:50] qualities the virtues alright what's
[1:03:56] going to bring a rapture what's going to
[1:03:58] bring a right play for somebody to come
[1:04:01] in to these qualities these virtues
[1:04:04] these things all right go ahead now we
[1:04:08] know according to what the next one is
[1:04:10] that the Holy Ghost is not correctly
[1:04:12] talked cording to blasts Aeneas ninth
[1:04:15] and see that's what people today well we
[1:04:20] can't be this and we can't meet it we're
[1:04:22] just sitting around waiting on God to do
[1:04:24] something we don't do something boy one
[1:04:29] of these days maybe he's gonna do
[1:04:30] something well now what's wrong with us
[1:04:35] believing that it's here now what's the
[1:04:38] what's the problem what's the problem
[1:04:41] with us believing that God has already
[1:04:43] sent us the prophet of Malacca forward
[1:04:45] to bring us the message
[1:04:47] he's already brought the message he's
[1:04:50] not got to come back and bring the
[1:04:52] message he's brought the message all
[1:04:56] right now why are we concerned about it
[1:04:58] see yes he said and when you talk about
[1:05:00] the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a
[1:05:02] lot goes with it that's the statue of a
[1:05:06] perfect man is the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:08] Spirit you're born again at faith right
[1:05:13] but the growth development it's the
[1:05:15] statue of a perfect man which is the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost dwelling in you so all we
[1:05:23] need to do is make sure we get the Holy
[1:05:24] Ghost all right then from there we can
[1:05:28] expect a growth development with the way
[1:05:33] that it's been so incorrectly tell you
[1:05:35] well you believe the mansion's don't you
[1:05:37] so you got the Holy Ghost you don't cut
[1:05:39] your hire word painter you don't mend oh
[1:05:41] how long hire no and what we're in the
[1:05:44] message we got the Holy Ghost they had
[1:05:51] that in Missoula Street and then you can
[1:05:56] argue your Pentecost we've had that you
[1:05:59] won't argue right come on they had it
[1:06:03] they had to hire in the closing
[1:06:04] addresses and everything was right they
[1:06:08] didn't bring the rapture
[1:06:14] you say well you don't believe in
[1:06:16] preaching against women dressing huh
[1:06:18] I believe you don't have to preach about
[1:06:21] women's dressing higher you need to
[1:06:23] preach for them to get the new birth if
[1:06:24] they get the new birth it'll take care
[1:06:26] of the higher and the clothes and the
[1:06:28] men and all of that in the other all the
[1:06:30] men and their clothes and their
[1:06:31] dressings are doing and everything it'll
[1:06:33] be taken care of by the baptism of the
[1:06:35] holy go that's why it's incorrectly tall
[1:06:37] well if you get this you'll quit now you
[1:06:39] don't have to quit nothing that's where
[1:06:42] the trouble is you go try to introduce
[1:06:43] somebody to message and the first thing
[1:06:45] you've got to quit Clinton you hire to
[1:06:46] be a Christian I don't like you a
[1:06:49] Christian that's aftereffects come on
[1:06:55] I'm sorry but listen why did the Prophet
[1:07:01] come to do and trying to just get a
[1:07:05] point to you of what you're looking at
[1:07:07] because these things are required go
[1:07:09] ahead with number number five we're not
[1:07:16] building an organization I'm not here
[1:07:18] this morning to build an organization
[1:07:19] Christ never sent me to build on our
[1:07:21] build organization Christ sent me to
[1:07:24] build individuals to the stature of
[1:07:27] Jesus Christ why that they might be the
[1:07:32] powerhouse of the dwelling place of the
[1:07:34] Spirit by his word by his words he built
[1:07:38] up the individual to that place not
[1:07:41] build an organization to a greater
[1:07:43] denomination but building individual two
[1:07:46] sons and daughters of God that's the
[1:07:48] idea the add to your faith virtue to
[1:07:52] your virtue knowledge and now well
[1:07:54] you're coming into a place what is it
[1:07:59] the Prophet was sent to build
[1:08:01] individuals to build individuals into
[1:08:12] the stature of a perfect man
[1:08:14] the powerhouse by his word that's what
[1:08:18] he was sent for but what do we do we
[1:08:21] turn it down
[1:08:23] going over to paragraph 178 of the same
[1:08:26] quote
[1:08:29] Christ born you into it see they buy
[1:08:33] your faith see you're regenerated and
[1:08:35] born into it and then after you're born
[1:08:37] into it these are the things that he
[1:08:39] expects you to add just keep adding them
[1:08:42] now you're going right down the line he
[1:08:46] expects you to add know God is expecting
[1:08:54] his people to come forth into these
[1:08:59] things he's given us the way he's made
[1:09:02] everything according to that and he's
[1:09:04] expecting us to do it listen to what
[1:09:07] we're doing go ahead and number six
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:17] if I'm a Christian of the Holy Ghost the
[1:09:19] Holy Ghost comes upon you and the true
[1:09:21] baptism with the Holy Ghost now listen
[1:09:23] and you got these virtues that's talking
[1:09:25] about when it comes up to the point
[1:09:26] everything brought into you see the true
[1:09:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got
[1:09:31] all these virtues filled in you then God
[1:09:34] Leo's in the tabernacle called the
[1:09:37] building the living tabernacle of the
[1:09:39] Living God's dwelling place when a man
[1:09:41] possesses these kind of things then the
[1:09:44] Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you
[1:09:47] might speak with tongues
[1:09:49] you might impersonate any gift that God
[1:09:51] has got and you might do that but until
[1:09:55] these virtues here go into you listen
[1:10:00] you're still off the real true
[1:10:04] foundation of faith in other words if
[1:10:08] they don't come in us then our faith
[1:10:10] would be wrong all right but when these
[1:10:13] virtues grow in and you add that to that
[1:10:15] then you are a living monument you're a
[1:10:17] living moving hotle that's what God
[1:10:20] won't know what brother Dale I just
[1:10:26] don't see how we can become anything we
[1:10:28] can't but we can yield to him and let
[1:10:32] him take care of it
[1:10:35] we can't do anything or sell order know
[1:10:40] that but we can yield ourselves we can
[1:10:43] hinder him from doing what he's wanting
[1:10:46] to do what these virtues no matter you
[1:10:51] might even speak with tongues whatever
[1:10:53] you do
[1:10:55] but if you're not a living moving Idol
[1:10:59] get a point then we'll pick up and think
[1:11:05] on border number seven taken from the
[1:11:13] statue of perfect man now we put the
[1:11:16] blood of Jesus Christ in see now that's
[1:11:19] the new birthright coming to faith going
[1:11:22] to live again now you put the blood of
[1:11:25] Jesus Christ and we know you don't put
[1:11:27] the blood of Jesus Christ in the
[1:11:29] birthright he's explaining it in
[1:11:31] spiritual in natural terms what is to
[1:11:34] happen in this virtual riot now you've
[1:11:37] put the blood of Jesus Christ in sea and
[1:11:39] that brings the faith of Jesus Christ in
[1:11:42] other words your total dependence was
[1:11:43] upon him and that brings his faith and
[1:11:47] the virtue of Christ the knowledge of
[1:11:50] Christ the temperature Christ the
[1:11:52] patience of jesus christ the godliness
[1:11:55] of jesus christ the brotherly kindness
[1:11:57] of Jesus and the love of God which is
[1:12:00] Jesus Christ
[1:12:01] he's the head and controlled you and
[1:12:03] your feet is the foundation controlled
[1:12:05] by the head to learn your there is the
[1:12:08] perfect man of God when he possesses
[1:12:11] these virtues what's going to bring
[1:12:16] about God's Word and bring it into
[1:12:22] position that he wants it to be go into
[1:12:28] the break all these off the statue of a
[1:12:31] perfect man so when you surrender your
[1:12:33] complete being then the Holy Spirit just
[1:12:37] pours through you in these virtues and
[1:12:40] then you're a living Tabernacle then
[1:12:43] people look out and cry that's a man
[1:12:46] full of virtue or knowledge he believes
[1:12:47] the word temperance patience godliness
[1:12:49] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:12:51] God of the Holy Ghost E and there he is
[1:12:54] walking around what is it a stature that
[1:12:57] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[1:13:00] a Christian there is a man or a woman
[1:13:02] who knows what they're talking about
[1:13:04] you never seen a condor sweeter godly or
[1:13:08] person
[1:13:08] you're sealed of sealed shows on both
[1:13:10] sides whether you're going you're coming
[1:13:12] you see the seal just the same there you
[1:13:15] are
[1:13:15] when a man or woman possesses the this
[1:13:19] possesses this then that capstone comes
[1:13:22] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[1:13:25] God which is the Holy Ghost so if we
[1:13:29] don't have those virtues ahead stones
[1:13:30] not coming right is that what he's
[1:13:36] saying if these virtues are not there
[1:13:39] there's no headstone well right now
[1:13:42] according to the Prophet now how long
[1:13:43] you want to stay on that a quotient
[1:13:45] there's got to be the headstones got to
[1:13:48] come to the body to take it through he
[1:13:51] can't nothing can happen without the
[1:13:53] headstone coming the headstone is love
[1:13:56] the capstone to the pyramid is love if
[1:13:59] these things are not in us he can't
[1:14:01] count us off so he's waiting on you and
[1:14:05] I write waiting on us to get straight
[1:14:10] and get it right
[1:14:19] let's read this one then you'll pick it
[1:14:20] up a thought maybe go ahead a number
[1:14:22] nine and you'll pick up a thought that
[1:14:25] we're bringing next week that working me
[1:14:28] let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out
[1:14:31] then I might be able to teach those
[1:14:34] where God has said in the church
[1:14:36] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:14:38] evangelists all for the perfecting and
[1:14:41] bring in all of these virtues into it
[1:14:44] for that perfection of the coming of the
[1:14:47] Son of God each one of these stones are
[1:14:49] material off of that one this is
[1:14:52] material of this each one of these
[1:14:54] virtues belong into him and they're
[1:14:57] pouring out of him down through them the
[1:15:01] other words coming inside of you what
[1:15:04] the fivefold ministry is involved in
[1:15:05] this all I want to say is a word or two
[1:15:09] and then we'll pick up on the rest of
[1:15:11] the thought going
[1:15:18] he has brought us the message and he's
[1:15:24] waiting on you and I to you know believe
[1:15:29] that message well how can we hear
[1:15:33] without a preacher an attic and he
[1:15:35] preach unless he be sent right now
[1:15:41] according to P Ephesians the FIFO
[1:15:47] ministries for the perfecting of the
[1:15:48] science I wish you would go home type in
[1:15:54] apostles prophets pastors evangelists
[1:15:56] pastors teachers top in the five
[1:15:59] ministries and see how many times right
[1:16:04] around talks for the fivefold ministry
[1:16:08] but yet everybody thinks yeah okay
[1:16:11] brother branham has got this brother
[1:16:13] Browns got that but they don't bring the
[1:16:18] ministry in now all I'm gonna say this
[1:16:23] and then we'll pick it up Sunday Moses
[1:16:28] got the pattern in heaven right and
[1:16:32] Moses came back to earth and delivered
[1:16:35] the pattern of how to build a temple but
[1:16:39] show me one place in there that Moses
[1:16:40] ever done anything now I'm not saying he
[1:16:47] debt and I'm just making a point I hope
[1:16:50] you get it you see it wasn't for him to
[1:16:54] do anything it was him to give the
[1:16:57] orders the people was to carry that out
[1:17:02] Moses didn't know how to saw a board and
[1:17:05] do this that and the other maybe he
[1:17:07] didn't know how to make this out of
[1:17:08] purple and how to make this out of that
[1:17:10] he depended upon the people to manifest
[1:17:17] right
[1:17:20] he was dependent upon somebody else
[1:17:22] Moses what it wasn't for him to do a lot
[1:17:28] of work
[1:17:29] Solomon wasn't out there with a working
[1:17:35] he was in charge somebody else was doing
[1:17:39] the work what are you trying to say I'm
[1:17:41] saying that the Prophet bringing the
[1:17:44] message to the endtime bride is very
[1:17:47] wonderful we believe that without that
[1:17:52] we wouldn't be nothing but without the
[1:17:55] fivefold ministry you can't make
[1:17:57] manifest what the Prophet said that's
[1:18:00] all I'm saying will prove that the Lord
[1:18:03] willing next week and some thoughts and
[1:18:05] times that maybe we'll cover it deep
[1:18:07] enough for you to do but listen Church I
[1:18:12] want you to look at number three go back

[1:18:32] number three look at the word that the
[1:18:37] Prophet he's got so roll over to about
[1:18:41] 370 where we can save reading and all of
[1:18:47] these risks the stones and the pyramid
[1:18:49] they're lying so perfectly until you
[1:18:50] can't run a razor break between weighing
[1:18:53] tons in there how they got them they
[1:18:55] don't know but they will and what up
[1:18:58] here the period cap pyramid that does
[1:19:00] come the pyramid itself the body of
[1:19:03] Christ will have to be home not only
[1:19:05] just some creed or doctrine or something
[1:19:09] others we could we come true it'll have
[1:19:12] to be so perfectly like Christ that when
[1:19:15] he comes he and the ministry will fit my
[1:19:18] right smack together then will come the
[1:19:21] rapture they're going home now let's
[1:19:27] watch the next quote go ahead and number
[1:19:33] three
[1:19:37] Refik to halt but each age has placed
[1:19:43] these things into his church and
[1:19:45] pattered it by showing these things each
[1:19:49] individual has these possess these
[1:19:52] qualities and watch him and this being
[1:19:55] when it's completed this person that
[1:20:00] comes to these virtues when it's
[1:20:03] completed
[1:20:04] what is the Church of God going in the
[1:20:09] rapture that's a group that's all of us
[1:20:13] together and this being and completed is
[1:20:17] a servant of God in the Church of God
[1:20:20] that's going in the garage sure glory
[1:20:23] see what I mean there you are there's
[1:20:26] the full-time what would he tell rapture
[1:20:28] into it you know rapture come on ever
[1:20:37] born-again believer listen to the
[1:20:40] message now ever born again believer
[1:20:44] ever born-again believer that's truly
[1:20:47] born again we'll go into rapture because
[1:20:50] that's the Word of God it's the rapture
[1:20:53] why is he bringing this down here in the
[1:20:55] rapture with these possessions and that
[1:20:59] you realize what he's saying if somebody
[1:21:04] don't come to perfection to bring this
[1:21:06] thing to Pais there's not going to be a
[1:21:08] rapture I changed in a moment in a
[1:21:11] twinkling of an eye somebody's
[1:21:16] responsible they without us cannot be
[1:21:19] made perfect that's in the stature of a
[1:21:21] perfect man we'll get to it Sunday more
[1:21:24] on the point but I'm born I want to get
[1:21:25] is if there's going to be a rapture
[1:21:29] there's got to be rapture in faith
[1:21:34] right rapture and faith is rapture and
[1:21:38] revelation somebody is going to come to
[1:21:41] a time to be changed and to be changed
[1:21:46] the moment wink of an eye right Lord
[1:21:51] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:21:53] shout border Archangel wrong in the dead
[1:21:56] in Christ shall rise first and we which
[1:21:58] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:22:00] to meet the Lord you realize there's got
[1:22:04] to be a resurrection before there can be
[1:22:06] a rapture change I've snapped my fingers
[1:22:09] to illustrate a change in a moment in
[1:22:12] the twinkling of an eye ever born-again
[1:22:15] believer goes in the rapture because the
[1:22:16] rapture is inside of you when you're
[1:22:18] born again somebody's gonna come to a
[1:22:21] place if not we're just gonna keep on
[1:22:26] going somebody's gonna come to the place
[1:22:31] to understand what this message is far I
[1:22:38] told you the first phase of it that's
[1:22:40] what the messenger of Malachi for Luke
[1:22:44] 1730 we turn our hearts back to the
[1:22:47] faith of the fathers
[1:22:53] but without a fivefold ministry how can
[1:22:57] it take place
[1:22:59] Rodale you're putting your dependence on
[1:23:01] the fivefold ministry I put my
[1:23:03] dependence upon brother Branham okay
[1:23:08] well no problem no trouble we I'm not
[1:23:11] gonna argue in 0.3 I'm just gonna say
[1:23:16] what he said it you show me what you got
[1:23:19] and what it says and I'll show you what
[1:23:21] he said I'll show you what the Bible
[1:23:24] says the Bible says the FIFO ministries
[1:23:28] for the perfecting of the son the
[1:23:30] Prophet said to fifl ministry is for the
[1:23:33] perfecting of the sons yeah but we got
[1:23:39] out with no that's your thoughts now I
[1:23:41] ain't arguing with you and your thoughts
[1:23:43] or what you think I'm just saying what
[1:23:47] the prophets say it I've made myself
[1:23:50] plain and clear there's going to be a
[1:23:53] resurrection come one day and we're
[1:23:56] going to be around here for about 30-40
[1:23:58] days from the time of the resurrection
[1:24:00] to the literal changing or going away
[1:24:03] we're going to not call each other
[1:24:05] brother Dale I've seen dead raised have
[1:24:09] you seen that ever I seen dead raised
[1:24:12] but I don't believe it
[1:24:19] I don't tell me we're gonna be sitting
[1:24:21] in this building dry died and half
[1:24:23] asleep and everything else I'm talking
[1:24:24] me to come on and the dead starts
[1:24:27] walking among us I'm just not in that
[1:24:33] category I think it's gonna cause me to
[1:24:35] either run out that door or get to
[1:24:37] running up and down these aisles or do
[1:24:39] something don't you come on you see your
[1:24:46] mom your dad come walking in you mean
[1:24:48] you I'll glory we found it that way we
[1:24:51] done it now I don't think so we got two
[1:24:58] pictures downstairs or the young are the
[1:25:00] people in their younger years if they
[1:25:02] walk among us we know what they look
[1:25:04] like
[1:25:07] right that's how much I expect them I
[1:25:11] expect them to walk among us and for 30
[1:25:15] 40 days you can have run around in the
[1:25:17] preach 24 hours a day seven days of the
[1:25:21] week for that whole time that's fine
[1:25:24] with me
[1:25:25] but we got to get dark according to the
[1:25:34] Prophet according to the Bible they
[1:25:36] without us cannot be made perfect see we
[1:25:41] don't put the confidence really do we
[1:25:44] have our confidence built in with the
[1:25:47] Prophet being the Prophet I'm asking
[1:25:54] your Krishna do we have our life is
[1:25:58] everything at stake of the Prophet being
[1:26:00] the Prophet I mean we really believed
[1:26:04] this was it you see two whole church is
[1:26:08] leaving it now that used to swear by
[1:26:11] that there's like I said this morning
[1:26:13] that a lot of them churches and other
[1:26:15] than people in them churches is what
[1:26:16] brought us into the message right and
[1:26:23] yet now were they at you think they
[1:26:27] believe the Prophet was the prophet of
[1:26:28] Malachi 4 no they wouldn't be going the
[1:26:31] way they're going I don't need to be
[1:26:35] explained doesn't it they wouldn't be
[1:26:37] doing it you see but there's more to the
[1:26:45] story because see the fivefold ministry
[1:26:47] has got to come in there I didn't write
[1:26:52] the Bible where it says Department of
[1:26:55] ministries for the perfecting I didn't
[1:26:58] write it
[1:26:59] God wrote it it's up to him take care of
[1:27:01] it now listen I've always been playing
[1:27:03] with you too there's a lot of the people
[1:27:07] of this message that called himself
[1:27:09] ministers I wouldn't walk across the
[1:27:12] street to listen to
[1:27:15] I have been coke when I walked in the
[1:27:18] building and there's preaching I didn't
[1:27:20] know there's preaching and I have been
[1:27:22] caught like that yeah okay
[1:27:24] but you get what I mean I ain't driving
[1:27:28] about the country to listen to somebody
[1:27:29] that I can't agree with well because I
[1:27:40] don't believe that part of the fivefold
[1:27:41] ministry well who are you I'm me who are
[1:27:44] you that's not that I'm not trying to
[1:27:51] make nothing of the fivefold ministry
[1:27:52] I'm trying to do it I'm trying to let
[1:27:55] God make it I ask you some questions
[1:28:01] your while back about the faithful
[1:28:04] ministry do you know that the fivefold
[1:28:07] ministry is predestinated
[1:28:17] above the nine spiritual gifts the nine
[1:28:23] spiritual gifts is predestinated by for
[1:28:25] knowledge but the fivefold ministry as
[1:28:28] gifts by for ministries gifts to you
[1:28:41] and you're not going no higher in your
[1:28:43] pasture so just some of you yeah so long
[1:28:50] because you're not depending upon the
[1:28:52] ministry but see it's got to be or else
[1:29:00] you tell me the pulpits yours for you to
[1:29:04] tell me what's going to take place or
[1:29:05] what I did I've made myself clear over
[1:29:08] all of these years I'm not trying to
[1:29:10] build anything I'm trying to tell the
[1:29:12] truth I've always believed the fivefold
[1:29:15] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[1:29:18] science I've always believed what the
[1:29:21] prophets say it he said these young men
[1:29:24] oh I'm breaking it down big nuggets
[1:29:27] maybe some word or some if you he said
[1:29:29] but they'll take over and break it on
[1:29:31] down for the people I believe that you
[1:29:35] believe the fivefold ministry is
[1:29:36] infallible
[1:29:37] I don't believe brother Branham was
[1:29:38] infallible I know I believe his message
[1:29:47] is infallible but his message is not the
[1:29:53] white horse rider being the Antichrist
[1:29:56] or this Christ or that Christ
[1:30:02] you know the name saying the white roads
[1:30:03] writer was an old ago
[1:30:04] that's not infallible but his message is
[1:30:08] infallible but there's a lot the human
[1:30:12] element said that's not infallible I've
[1:30:17] always been straight on that there's a
[1:30:19] lot brother Brennan said we were
[1:30:20] discussing that at lunch but her brother
[1:30:22] said some things that are hard to be
[1:30:24] able to understand I believe it was Paul
[1:30:30] that said they wrestled with it to their
[1:30:32] own destruction I believe in a FIFO
[1:30:40] ministry and I believe that the church
[1:30:45] is not going to go without the fivefold
[1:30:47] ministry bringing the message with that
[1:30:50] prophet brought the message to you and I
[1:30:52] it's not that we've got to find
[1:30:54] something in the message that's a hidden
[1:30:57] secret or we got to find this or we've
[1:30:59] got to come up with our own ideas if it
[1:31:04] is the messenger malachi for look 17:30
[1:31:06] didn't do the two thing you see that's
[1:31:10] why that I always read to you what I can
[1:31:13] to show you the Prophet said it cause I
[1:31:15] want you to hear what he said and then
[1:31:20] that way at least you can say what he
[1:31:21] said what he saying but the human
[1:31:28] elements of each one of us is our
[1:31:31] problems or our problems the human
[1:31:35] elements that we are
[1:31:40] but only thing I'm asking you is one
[1:31:42] time
[1:31:42] do you believe these virtues is required
[1:31:47] they were in the Word of God are they
[1:31:49] required of you and I I believe they are
[1:31:52] well then how we're gonna get them we
[1:31:57] could at least follow the pattern or
[1:31:59] thoughts of the Prophet that the Prophet
[1:32:04] was to bring us the Word of God and he
[1:32:08] done his part now it's left up to the
[1:32:12] fivefold ministry to take that and bring
[1:32:15] it on
[1:32:15] not to bring something new see there's
[1:32:17] where the trouble is that's what the
[1:32:19] biggest portion of the ministry that's
[1:32:20] message done they want to bring
[1:32:22] something new they don't want to stay
[1:32:25] with what he said they won't bring
[1:32:27] something new mm-hmm
[1:32:31] we don't need nothing you I'm happy
[1:32:33] where I'm at well I don't agree with you
[1:32:37] brother on this come show me where I'm
[1:32:38] offering the word don't come to me so
[1:32:45] what I don't like your attitude
[1:32:46] that ain't in the word attitudes you got
[1:32:51] them I got them that ain't in the word
[1:32:53] maybe the virtuous will take care of the
[1:32:55] attitudes all right but some come and
[1:33:00] show me where I'm off the word that's
[1:33:02] all I've ever asked anybody to do but
[1:33:05] I've had people to turn to walk out
[1:33:06] these doors they would not dare tell me
[1:33:10] where I was off yet they've told
[1:33:13] everybody else where I thought I've at
[1:33:17] least asked you to stay with me and tell
[1:33:19] me because I believe that God can use
[1:33:23] the ministry to bring us to the right
[1:33:26] place
[1:33:30] that's why I rejoice when these brothers
[1:33:32] Minister I hear them trying to explain
[1:33:35] something from their heart that God has
[1:33:38] spoken to them because I believe it
[1:33:44] that's part of my living now quote
[1:33:49] brother Branham will the bride have a
[1:33:52] ministry that's a direct quote will the
[1:33:56] bride have a ministry the a spread
[1:33:59] around he said sure
[1:34:00] he said she consists she consists of
[1:34:05] apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:34:08] and teachers
[1:34:09] he said the fivefold ministry consist of
[1:34:12] that you know what you are what I teach
[1:34:17] what do you like it or not
[1:34:19] these brothers that it went out and
[1:34:22] ministered they just Minister a little
[1:34:27] bit and they go out there and they start
[1:34:28] telling them about what's believed in
[1:34:30] this church you gonna find out you ain't
[1:34:31] going out to her very much
[1:34:35] no no they all say that's where brother
[1:34:39] Dale
[1:34:46] at least everybody knows what I believe
[1:34:48] I don't have to be peter-patter around
[1:34:53] about it they know what I believe yeah
[1:35:00] but do we believe these virtues are
[1:35:03] required if we do then we've got to have
[1:35:06] them if we've got to have them how do we
[1:35:09] get them that's all I'm asking
[1:35:14] how do we get them if we got to have
[1:35:18] them is this some automatic push-button
[1:35:22] thing about this or is it a growth
[1:35:26] development in Jesus Christ which one is
[1:35:32] it
[1:35:32] let's stand together as we go into the
[1:35:35] communion think on these things because
[1:35:42] we believe God's Word God has given us
[1:35:45] all of these things he's placed
[1:35:48] everything in order
[1:35:49] I believe he's given us what we have
[1:35:52] required you know what's required of us
[1:35:55] God has given it to us I don't believe
[1:36:00] he's got to come back and give us some
[1:36:03] other requirement I think he'd give us
[1:36:08] the requirement and all we got to do
[1:36:12] then is just rest in the requirement and
[1:36:14] try to do what it says what would be
[1:36:18] hard you know I mean wouldn't that be
[1:36:23] something for me to go to brother Donny
[1:36:26] and said rather Donny my transmissions
[1:36:29] Torah would you tell me how to fix it
[1:36:32] then he'd say well first you gotta pull
[1:36:35] I don't want to do that you've got to go
[1:36:41] I don't want to do that well I thought
[1:36:45] she wanted you to transmission things I
[1:36:47] do but I don't want to do that he says
[1:36:51] well you ain't gonna get it fixed unless
[1:36:54] you do that
[1:36:56] am I gonna change my own way of thinking
[1:37:01] or am I going what am I gonna do let's
[1:37:08] get into the main seizure Paulding
[1:37:13] corinthians says for have received of
[1:37:15] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:37:17] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:37:19] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:37:20] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:37:23] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:37:25] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:37:28] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:37:30] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:37:32] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:37:35] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:37:38] it in remembrance with me for as often
[1:37:40] as you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:37:42] you do shew the Lord's death till he
[1:37:44] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:37:47] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:37:49] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:37:52] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:37:54] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:37:56] that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:37:57] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:37:59] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:38:01] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:38:04] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:38:07] sickly among you and many sleep for we
[1:38:09] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:38:11] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:38:14] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:38:17] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:38:19] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:38:21] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:38:23] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:38:26] not together under condemnation the rest
[1:38:28] I said in order when I come let's have a
[1:38:32] few moments of just salat prayer praying
[1:38:34] one for the other and asking God to lead
[1:38:36] us remembering these that are traveling
[1:38:38] and the ones that are going to count and
[1:38:40] all of the people and not being here
[1:38:43] today remember to each one
