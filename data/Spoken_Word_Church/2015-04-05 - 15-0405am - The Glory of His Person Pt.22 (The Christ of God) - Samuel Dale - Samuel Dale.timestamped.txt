[9:42] in Jesus name
[9:45] amen let's just read these six verses
[9:49] and we'll read it responsive
[9:52] okay so we'll read it responsive now to
[9:55] where you know I read the first you read
[9:58] the next down to the verse six okay now
[10:01] upon the first day of the week very
[10:04] early in the morning they came un the
[10:06] suppl bring the spices which they had
[10:09] prepared and certain others with
[10:17] them and they entered in and found not
[10:20] the body of the Lord
[10:23] Jesus
[10:28] came
[10:29] two men stood by them in
[10:32] shin and as they were afraid and bowed
[10:36] down their faces to the Earth they said
[10:38] unto them why seek ye the living among
[10:42] the dead together he is not here but is
[10:47] risen remember how he spake unto you
[10:51] when he was yet in Galilee and you may
[10:54] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[10:57] the reading of the word
[10:59] now we
[11:02] have we're still speaking from the point
[11:05] of of the uh
[11:07] Revelations 1 we'll bypass that this
[11:10] morning but we'll go
[11:13] to uh Matthew 16 I remember Brother
[11:17] Anderson today because he's in the back
[11:20] room running everything by himself he's
[11:23] the whole computer end is based on his
[11:26] shoulder this morning on that to get
[11:29] everything to go and thank God Josh is
[11:31] here to run the sound system and things
[11:33] through here so then that makes it all
[11:36] work out but you know we thank God for
[11:39] these that can do these things to where
[11:42] others can be able to view so let's go
[11:45] for our thought today let's go to
[11:47] Matthew
[11:48] 16 and just read our scripture from
[11:52] Matthew
[11:53] 16 and uh then we'll go
[11:56] to uh John and excuse excuse me go to
[11:59] Luke we go to Matthew 1 16 and then
[12:03] we'll go to
[12:14] Luke when Jesus came into the coast of
[12:16] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[12:18] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[12:22] man am and they said some say that thou
[12:26] John the Baptist see because he had
[12:28] signs like John and the different things
[12:30] you know some say Elias because he was a
[12:33] prophet form some say Jeremiah you know
[12:36] and all are one of the prophets he said
[12:40] unto them but whom say ye that I am amen
[12:45] and Simon Peter said unto him Thou Art
[12:48] the
[12:49] Christ the son of the Living God we'll
[12:51] just stop on verse 16 now we'll go to
[12:54] Luke because I want you to notice now
[12:58] this is the same writing all right but I
[13:00] want you to notice the
[13:03] thought
[13:05] because the Matthew
[13:08] says you know showing his part that
[13:10] Peter is saying that thou art the
[13:13] Christ the son of the Living God all
[13:17] right now meaning you are God Almighty
[13:21] in human
[13:24] flesh not two Gods to another God or
[13:27] anything like that you are the Christ
[13:29] we've been back in Genesis going for
[13:31] quite a while and coming down through
[13:34] the the creation and bringing out the
[13:37] Christ and the form now look what it
[13:39] says in verse uh 20 of the n9th chapter
[13:43] of
[13:45] Luke and he saith unto them because
[13:48] that's what he asked you know John the
[13:50] Baptist and Elias or others he said unto
[13:54] them but whom say ye that I am Peter
[13:57] answering said
[13:59] the Christ of
[14:01] God now that's not different that's two
[14:03] different men describing to the point of
[14:07] what this you know the thought was
[14:10] because it's the same writing it's the
[14:13] same point you know the same uh but one
[14:15] of them says that you're the Christ the
[14:17] son of the Living God the other says
[14:19] you're the Christ of God uh now we know
[14:22] the word Christ means the anointed one
[14:25] and you know we will not be getting into
[14:29] as much as you think on that this
[14:31] morning but I want you to think with me
[14:35] because we have kind of finished up the
[14:39] uh point that we were trying to bring uh
[14:42] never to end anything but trying to
[14:44] bring the point of the creation of
[14:48] mankind and bringing it down to even
[14:51] that uh we understand the things now of
[14:55] God coming into being because he's
[14:58] condescending
[14:59] offending see if you covered him and and
[15:02] dealt with the word Elohim you would
[15:05] deal with Elohim as being the only word
[15:07] back there they could use and that would
[15:10] be self-existing so there was a time God
[15:13] was self-existing see nobody dwelt with
[15:16] him he existed alone because that's the
[15:19] point of what it would be and see that's
[15:22] where your Trinity comes in well one
[15:24] created the other one and the other one
[15:26] that you know so you're getting into
[15:28] things that are not even sensible
[15:31] because how could one God create another
[15:33] God or how would he be a God if he is
[15:37] created well you say well that was just
[15:39] a great mystery of the Trinity it would
[15:42] be a great mystery you know how that
[15:45] they could be co- uh equal and
[15:47] co-eternal now that's your statement
[15:50] from your your nan Creeds and things
[15:53] co-equal and co-eternal how can you be
[15:56] co-eternal
[15:58] there's only one
[16:00] Eternal there there's no way to be
[16:02] anything co-eternal the only way we can
[16:05] have eternal life is to have his own
[16:07] life not the point of trying to say we
[16:11] are Eternal can't be it's his own life
[16:14] all right then showing that we believe
[16:16] in the one true and living God but we
[16:19] believe in the many manifestations of
[16:21] that God father son Holy Ghost his
[16:25] manifestations are not
[16:29] just changing his form from what was be
[16:31] in the time see then there was back in
[16:34] the Old Testament you would call him
[16:36] Jehovah the father see then when he was
[16:39] on Earth the Bible says God was in
[16:42] Christ reconciling the world unto
[16:44] himself so it would come down to where
[16:46] that that same God would be dwelling in
[16:48] Flesh on the earth called a son now the
[16:50] same God is in the form of the baptism
[16:52] of the Holy Ghost all right that makes
[16:55] it
[16:56] sensible that but you can't can't do
[16:58] with do away with any of those things
[17:01] that's my point I've been trying to make
[17:04] about it that as God has revealing
[17:06] himself to
[17:08] mankind so as he starts descending
[17:12] toward us condescending is a better word
[17:16] to where that is coming down to where he
[17:19] can reveal hisself to you and I to
[17:23] mankind all right then in that we find
[17:26] that in in the creation he reveals
[17:29] himself uh you know if I had time I
[17:31] could go back we can go through all of
[17:34] the the first chapter of Genesis and
[17:36] take all of those things and show that
[17:39] those things are showing his glory his
[17:42] person and that's what we're talking
[17:45] about we still haven't got over in the
[17:46] Book of Revelations to that but showing
[17:50] what he is
[17:51] doing this is the revealing God of God
[17:54] it's not the revealing of me and you see
[17:57] we need to get that out of the way way
[17:59] it's revealing of God in you and
[18:02] I all right the new birth in you and I
[18:05] is the same God it created the
[18:07] world well you say but how can that be
[18:10] well if you can explain God you can you
[18:13] won't have no question about how could
[18:15] it be because do you believe he's
[18:17] capable of giving everybody in the world
[18:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they'd
[18:22] accept it well how could he be divided
[18:24] among 7 billion
[18:26] people you can't expl explain those
[18:29] things it's
[18:30] unexplainable but to know and to realize
[18:32] each one of those persons has eternal
[18:35] life because that is what the new birth
[18:37] is all right now then seeing it back
[18:41] there we've seen the creation shows the
[18:44] Creator you remember that we've dwelt on
[18:47] that for quite a while that looking at
[18:49] the creation we can see the Creator I'm
[18:52] going to try to stay behind here today
[18:53] because Brother Anderson running both
[18:55] poles and he's got to run over if I run
[18:57] over and go back so I'll try to hold on
[19:00] to here okay all right I gener walk
[19:03] right there anyway but we won't try to
[19:06] do that today as much all right now
[19:09] we've seen the creation of man brings
[19:12] forth the understanding of the great
[19:16] Eternal
[19:18] God because even back before the
[19:21] foundation of the world according to
[19:24] Genesis 1 126 and 27 when he said he
[19:27] made man in his own image see then he
[19:30] made that
[19:31] man there in His image which was not
[19:34] another person but was
[19:38] himself made manifest in another form
[19:41] all right and that man that was
[19:45] created was God
[19:48] himself not the image of God like a
[19:52] person over here and this over here
[19:53] looks like it that's not the word in the
[19:56] Bible terminologies the word image in
[19:58] the the Bible terminologies means the
[20:00] exact same person or likeness or the
[20:04] being all right just to give a quick run
[20:07] through to come on to where I point for
[20:09] the day all right he took that man that
[20:12] he had created because he created the
[20:15] world he created the animals you know
[20:18] the the the world and all of the trees
[20:20] and the thing then he created the
[20:23] animals and brought them all into being
[20:26] but then the last thing that was created
[20:29] or part that was created was man in a
[20:32] physical
[20:33] form fleshly man and we read there in
[20:37] Genesis that he formed him out of the
[20:39] Dust of the earth he breathed into his
[20:41] nostrils he became a living Soul he
[20:43] placed him in read Genesis account
[20:46] placed him in the garden to rule over
[20:49] the animals as number one part because
[20:52] he had that part in him he even named
[20:54] the animals what a great person Adam was
[20:59] but yet then in that he was still a
[21:02] human being
[21:05] made right and then God took a rib from
[21:10] that
[21:11] man because he he saw him lonely he took
[21:14] a rib from that man and he made a body
[21:19] and he placed within that the you know
[21:23] the soul the spirit and made Eve all
[21:26] right making Adam and Eve as to be the
[21:31] the point in the garden that you know
[21:34] that they were together as
[21:36] one all right and in doing that he made
[21:41] her to be with him to where the the
[21:45] Bible didn't call her Eve it called her
[21:49] woman all right because Eve was the name
[21:53] that was given later when it says she
[21:55] become the mother of all living that's
[21:58] what the word eve come up for she didn't
[22:00] have that name to start with she she was
[22:03] a woman cuz she was taken from man all
[22:06] right beautiful situation wonderful part
[22:09] as to be in the garden as they could
[22:12] fellowship and do and and be with the
[22:15] animals and God would come down in the
[22:17] cool of the day as we'd say it and he
[22:19] would fellowship with them and at night
[22:21] the prophet said he would even put them
[22:23] to sleep and lay them down and and and
[22:26] would let them rest and and things not
[22:29] that they had to do but the point that
[22:33] they were mortal in
[22:35] flesh all right the tree of life was in
[22:38] the garden to remind them their youth
[22:41] was being renewed but their their bodies
[22:44] were not Eternal because they were a
[22:46] creation and you don't create something
[22:50] Eternal that that won't work all right
[22:53] but see then taking that Adam and
[22:56] letting him be there and putting Eve
[22:58] with him to where that Adam and Eve
[23:02] would both be there in the
[23:05] garden and they would be together and
[23:08] have a wonderful time in the soul of
[23:11] Adam and Eve we've
[23:12] covered this is taken from Blasphemous
[23:15] names where he talks about uh the
[23:17] prophet speaks of breathing into the
[23:20] nostrils of Adam and he became
[23:22] especially into Adam an eternal person
[23:25] with God gave him eternal life in his
[23:27] soul
[23:28] all right then Eve brother Bron speaking
[23:31] on why some people can't keep the
[23:34] victory he says that the blushing part
[23:37] of Eve you know the very blushing of
[23:40] eternal
[23:43] life made her beautiful see then Adam
[23:46] and Eve in their soul had eternal life
[23:49] right all right but now their body their
[23:52] Spirit was brought into being it was not
[23:56] Eternal all right then then we went
[23:58] through that uh Eve then as she began to
[24:04] listen to the the Beast that the Bible
[24:07] speaks of in Genesis about three there
[24:10] where it says the the serpent was the
[24:12] most subtle of all Beast well uh a beast
[24:15] and a serpent is two different things he
[24:17] was a beast was an upright creature even
[24:20] scofi in your Bible says that that don't
[24:24] relate it to a snake he said it was made
[24:27] that by the curse upon the Beast because
[24:30] that way the Beast would have been the
[24:32] link between man and the monkey that
[24:36] Darwin could not find he could find a a
[24:39] connecting link on all the animals and
[24:41] you can't argue with him about it
[24:43] because they were connections because we
[24:45] believe not in
[24:47] evolution we believe in Creative
[24:50] Evolution God created one animal and
[24:53] then he created a higher
[24:56] form right then he created a higher form
[25:00] within the life form that in his
[25:02] creation was
[25:04] mankind all right then placing that as
[25:08] we said that it was the part of his own
[25:10] being placing that into Adam and giving
[25:13] him eternal
[25:15] life placing it into Eve giving her
[25:17] eternal life but yet their body and
[25:20] their Spirit was not
[25:22] Eternal all right then we covered how
[25:26] that that Eve and her
[25:28] reasoning and as Paul says in the
[25:31] Corinthians that lest Satan tempt you
[25:35] you know and do as he did to Eve through
[25:39] the
[25:40] subtility the smartness the shrewdness
[25:42] of that Beast because the Beast was an
[25:45] upright creature remember the story
[25:48] Serpent and beast that's two different
[25:50] species of animals all right but he was
[25:53] a beast he was upright he could talk all
[25:57] right
[25:58] then the curse made him crawl up on the
[26:01] ground as a SN as a snake as we call it
[26:03] a
[26:04] serpent all right and then see you see
[26:07] no more from Genesis as we were talking
[26:09] about last night a little bit in the
[26:11] Bible study you don't see no more of
[26:13] that Beast because it's cursed and put
[26:16] into the snake form all right because it
[26:19] said upon the the dust thou shall eat
[26:22] the things and crawl upon your belly all
[26:25] right but isn't it odd that when you get
[26:28] to the Book of Revelations which I don't
[26:30] think it's odd I think it's a wonderful
[26:32] point that you started out with this
[26:36] Beast that Satan was
[26:39] using to do his things whatever you want
[26:42] to talk about and whatever you want to
[26:45] talk about what the the sin was if you
[26:47] want to talk about it an apple just
[26:49] remember the Beast was there to hand out
[26:52] the
[26:53] apples all right so if you want to be
[26:55] that part about it well I believe it was
[26:58] an apple that there eaten well if you
[27:00] want to be that way go ahead but just
[27:02] remember the Beast was there to give out
[27:04] the apples okay so you got the Beast
[27:08] formed there so just leave him what he
[27:10] is but isn't it odd over in the Book of
[27:11] Revelations that it returns back to the
[27:16] Beast read the book of Revelations it
[27:18] returns back to the Beast all right then
[27:21] we're not dealing with down through time
[27:24] as anything in the form of the Beast
[27:26] seed
[27:28] you're dealing with what the Bible says
[27:30] in Genesis 3:15 speaking to the
[27:33] serpent speaking to the snake that was
[27:36] made to the Earth I'll put enmity
[27:39] between thy seed and the seed of the
[27:42] woman all right what is the seed of the
[27:44] serpent
[27:46] unbelief no matter what religious form
[27:48] you are and what you believe it happened
[27:50] in the garden you still have to contend
[27:52] with the point that it was
[27:55] unbelief that caused all of the problems
[27:58] because that's the the problem today is
[28:00] still unbelief all right now just
[28:03] getting a little background part to
[28:05] where we come up through and Wednesday I
[28:09] don't know whether you enjoyed it but I
[28:10] did I I love to read the Bible and just
[28:13] look at it Page by page I I'm thoroughly
[28:16] enjoying the uh Bible study because we
[28:20] just started in
[28:22] Romans uh back I don't know nearly a
[28:25] year ago I guess and we're over to the
[28:28] eth chapter in Romans so it took us
[28:31] quite a while to to get over that far at
[28:34] least 6 months that we've been been
[28:37] doing that and just take a scripture and
[28:38] read it and you see what that scripture
[28:41] says read it for yourself don't don't
[28:44] say well we believe this because they
[28:47] taught us it read
[28:49] it till we was in Romans 81 you know
[28:52] where there is therefore now no
[28:53] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[28:56] Jesus and then you stop and if Paul
[28:59] hadn't to put the next words to it see
[29:01] you'd have said okay then they're in
[29:03] Christ Jesus it don't matter what I do
[29:05] I'm all right Paul put it in and it's
[29:07] called interpolating as the big words
[29:10] they use for it but it simply means he
[29:13] was making sure things were not going to
[29:15] get misunderstood so Paul was saying
[29:18] there is therefore now no condemnation
[29:20] to them that are in Christ Jesus what
[29:22] who walk after the
[29:24] flesh you know after the spirit and not
[29:27] after the flesh see he put his
[29:30] understanding there to where that it
[29:33] would would help us and that's the way
[29:35] that I like to read it and that's what
[29:37] we done Wednesday we just went through
[29:38] from one verse to the next verse of
[29:41] Genesis reading it see once you see what
[29:44] you're talking
[29:46] about once you get away from what you've
[29:48] been
[29:49] taught to the point of reading it then
[29:53] you read it and there's no problem with
[29:55] reading where it says the serpent was a
[29:57] the most subal of all
[29:59] beasts then you're not in Mass confusion
[30:02] of say a beast is one thing the
[30:04] Serpent's another thing one's a snake
[30:06] the other's upright what is they talking
[30:07] about see now you understand he was made
[30:11] a snake right that's why they can't find
[30:14] it don't you think now come on let's be
[30:17] human sensible don't you think that that
[30:20] mankind knows there's a connecting link
[30:22] between all the animals and don't you
[30:24] tell me they ain't tried to implant
[30:26] seeds of the monkey into the woman and
[30:28] the and the man into the monkey now
[30:31] don't tell me you're dumb science is a
[30:34] way ahead of you on those
[30:36] things they've been doing that a long
[30:38] time trying to get something to make
[30:39] sure that they they can make a
[30:41] connection because they can make a
[30:42] connection with everything else but that
[30:45] specie in the middle was totally
[30:47] destroyed it was so put till it was it
[30:50] didn't just go back to the monkey looked
[30:52] like it would have went from you know
[30:54] the Beast back to the monkey stage cuz
[30:56] that was the closest no it was placed so
[30:59] far back into the to the chain of
[31:02] creation until science cannot follow it
[31:05] but don't you tell me they ain't tried
[31:07] to mix a snake and a woman together I'm
[31:10] too old I'm 74 I'll be 75 pretty quick
[31:13] just don't tell me them stories I'm I'm
[31:15] beyond
[31:16] childhood I I know what they do in
[31:18] science they've done everything in the
[31:20] book that's how they wound up with a
[31:23] mule right a mule is not in the chain of
[31:26] cre ation right a m is a mixture between
[31:31] a an ass and
[31:33] a female horse all right a Marica
[31:39] brought it about and you got all kind of
[31:41] doings in that line that they've
[31:44] done God made the mule as brother B said
[31:47] I mean made the horse and the ass and
[31:50] man put them together and got a mule but
[31:53] they can't go no further that's right
[31:56] because it won't reprod produce itself
[31:58] all right but now are you following me
[32:01] but see because of that unbelief that
[32:03] was in Eve through her being what we
[32:06] call the the spirit form of her which is
[32:10] your body your C taste feel smelling
[32:12] here that's your contact to world with
[32:14] that all right your next real is Spirit
[32:17] real which is memory reason conscience
[32:20] affection go get your book and just read
[32:23] the biology I guess is that right is the
[32:26] biology about human body and that thing
[32:29] you know I'm done out of school a long
[32:30] time ago I didn't go very much anyway
[32:33] but and you can tell that but but see in
[32:37] that Spirit realm of memory reason
[32:40] conscious affection that's where Satan
[32:42] begin to deal with her and caused the
[32:45] wrong whatever you want to call it the
[32:46] eating of the apple or whatever you want
[32:48] to talk about it was caused by that
[32:50] being of that part of Eve well that's
[32:53] where Satan is still working today is
[32:56] through our men memory reason conscious
[32:58] affections and
[33:00] things he's working in that realm all
[33:03] right but then inside of man is the soul
[33:06] which is either born again or not born
[33:08] again right so it's either Faith or it's
[33:12] doubt is one or the other that controls
[33:14] us through the soul part of us and the
[33:17] soul is the real you right that's
[33:20] right because remember it doesn't say
[33:23] the spirit that sth or the body that
[33:24] sinth it says the soul that sth shall
[33:27] die so the soul is more real than the
[33:30] body and the spirit but Satan could not
[33:32] enter into Eve's soul but he could enter
[33:35] through her spirit being and showing her
[33:39] hey you have the motherly Instinct look
[33:42] at the animals they're reproducing as we
[33:45] were talking last night they're
[33:47] reproducing because you tell me they
[33:49] wouldn't reproducing in the garden I
[33:50] want to ask you one
[33:53] question I like to put it this way where
[33:55] you don't have anything to argue about
[33:57] out okay if you don't think they was
[34:00] reproducing in the garden what about the
[34:02] two animals that God took there the
[34:04] animal that God took the skin you lost
[34:07] your
[34:10] species
[34:12] right and God didn't create but one male
[34:15] and one female animal he didn't create a
[34:17] flock of chickens and and one old
[34:19] rooster that we want to look at he
[34:22] created one male and one
[34:24] female all right but see they were
[34:27] reproducing in the garden because
[34:29] there's nothing wrong with the
[34:30] reproduction of the animal
[34:33] form you say well I don't like that idea
[34:36] well that's all right you tell me some
[34:37] other
[34:38] way but you tell me something
[34:41] sensible because I just told you because
[34:43] we know the Bible says God took the
[34:45] Skins right well either he created some
[34:49] animals to take the skins off of which
[34:51] would be contrary to him because he'd
[34:52] already made them or he took the animals
[34:54] that were reproducing in the garden
[34:57] that's right all right so then the the
[35:00] serpent was smart The Devil Is What You
[35:04] signify with the word
[35:06] serpent is Satan the Bible says that old
[35:09] serpent me all right and he was telling
[35:13] Eve about the things of
[35:16] life through
[35:18] her memory reason cons and as he did he
[35:21] be coming into possession of the body as
[35:25] I keep saying cuz that's up to you
[35:27] you if you say it was an apple it had
[35:29] eaten well then it still got through the
[35:32] reasoning memory conscience and
[35:34] affections but I never did know of
[35:36] apples causing any problem except a
[35:38] belly ache you can do all you want to
[35:41] but that's true but anybody 20 years old
[35:45] got some sense and like I told you
[35:47] before my daddy told my mother way back
[35:50] he didn't know anything about the Bible
[35:52] he couldn't even read but she read him
[35:54] in Genesis one day and he told her what
[35:56] happened
[35:58] because he's 45 years old before he got
[36:00] married you understand what I mean he
[36:03] was already well knowing and he told her
[36:06] what happened in the garden that didn't
[36:08] make him a prophet that made him with
[36:10] plain
[36:11] sense once you can get away from reading
[36:14] now if you read in the newspaper that
[36:17] there was a man and a woman and a
[36:19] something else over here and this got
[36:21] all messed up over here and you was
[36:23] reading in the newspaper you'd say we
[36:25] know what happened
[36:27] we know what
[36:29] happened but you read it in the Bible
[36:31] you try to be so
[36:32] spiritual oh yeah okay get off your
[36:35] spiritual get out of Common Sense
[36:36] sometime and just read
[36:38] it the Bible say he said that he begal
[36:42] me defiled me all
[36:46] right but see then when it was brought
[36:48] forth that brought death upon the human
[36:52] race
[36:54] right whatever you want to call it and
[36:56] it brought death upon the human race all
[36:59] right then there was Adam and Eve and
[37:02] what are you going to do with
[37:05] them there was Adam and Eve with eternal
[37:07] life in their
[37:10] soul and the prophet gets into the to
[37:13] the the breach in the which is paragraph
[37:17] 91-93 I didn't give them these to do
[37:19] they're on the computer where other
[37:21] people can read them all right that man
[37:24] lost the claims of life eternal life and
[37:29] fell to
[37:31] death now in that falling to death did
[37:35] Adam fall from eternal life to death how
[37:38] can you do that so the prophet's not
[37:40] saying what we're thinking he's saying
[37:42] even though we got the
[37:46] words because he says you can't follow
[37:49] from eternal life he said if you ever
[37:51] have eternal life you can't lose it well
[37:54] right now he's meaning something
[37:56] different right right that's what we
[37:58] tried so much to get to you to think
[38:00] about so in the garden it throwed
[38:03] mankind into death and Adam and Eve
[38:07] died right right they were not supposed
[38:11] to die before then because the tree of
[38:13] life was there to reminded that their
[38:15] youth was being renewed but because of
[38:17] the Fall they
[38:20] died all right it doesn't mean they died
[38:22] and went to
[38:24] hell go remember if you take eternal
[38:27] life back away from a person you got an
[38:28] ending Giver out of God and that doesn't
[38:33] work I know I discussed this with people
[38:37] and and a person told me he said well
[38:39] that was back di before the New Birth
[38:42] come and they was capable of
[38:45] falling I said don't be an Indian
[38:48] giver God's not an inding Giver if he
[38:51] gave adam an eve eternal life he didn't
[38:53] take it back right it was just to point
[38:56] to the prophet explaining that they died
[38:59] where they was not going to
[39:01] die but they didn't die to the point
[39:03] they're
[39:05] lost all right see if they died to the
[39:08] point they're lost then you got trouble
[39:11] let's see what I wrote down see if I can
[39:13] find my own
[39:15] notes you
[39:17] know they could not fall to
[39:22] hell
[39:24] because the death they died of
[39:27] took about 3 or 400
[39:30] years right the physical death upon Adam
[39:34] and Eve and I didn't look up to see how
[39:36] many years they live but they lived way
[39:38] on over you know good many hundred years
[39:41] but it was the death on the point of not
[39:44] Eternal
[39:45] separation but it was a physical death
[39:48] that was put upon Mankind and everything
[39:51] after then would be born
[39:55] dead right
[39:57] CU that's what the Bible says about it
[39:58] says you're born dead see Adam and Eve
[40:01] lived a long
[40:04] time now here's what you're going to
[40:07] have to
[40:10] listen we think they went to or you
[40:13] could say they went to an eternal
[40:15] separation well I would like for you to
[40:18] explain that to
[40:20] me well they were put out of the
[40:25] garden oh okay they were put out the
[40:31] garden but I thought God dwelt with Adam
[40:34] and Eve on down through life that's
[40:37] right I thought he was with them from
[40:40] then on because the sacrifices were
[40:43] made the atonement was there and by the
[40:47] atonement being there he could
[40:49] fellowship with Adam and
[40:51] Eve so they never fell to an eternal
[40:54] separation they fell to Natural
[40:58] death and that brought all mankind then
[41:01] that would be born into the world would
[41:04] be born in Satan's domain and would be
[41:07] the point that it would
[41:09] be we're dead
[41:13] right you and I are born dead I don't
[41:16] care how much you think you're alive I'm
[41:18] 74 but I ain't 74 I'm only what God has
[41:23] given me of eternal life cuz that's 74
[41:26] years don't Mount to
[41:30] nothing are you following what I'm
[41:32] saying see their soul was eternal Adam
[41:34] and Eve Soul was eternal but their body
[41:36] and their Spirit was not Eternal so when
[41:39] death came on man it fell upon his body
[41:41] Spirit form in Adam and Eve but then the
[41:45] next person that was born God didn't
[41:48] give them eternal
[41:52] life right CU you better be careful
[41:56] about about that cuz remember there was
[41:58] a Cain and an Abel you might think about
[42:01] your lineage of Abel but you don't want
[42:04] to think about your lineage of Cain
[42:06] right at least you know that much about
[42:08] the Bible see I like to talk that way
[42:10] because that way you can go home and
[42:12] sensibly think something over all right
[42:16] because if if mankind after then
[42:18] received eternal life then you'd have
[42:19] Cain with eternal life no the next
[42:23] person that came in which was Cain and
[42:24] Abel both of them was lost right Abel
[42:27] needed a sacrifice this as well as oh
[42:29] wait a minute no we got this lineage
[42:31] this lineage come down to Abel and it
[42:33] come down to here and
[42:36] it
[42:39] uhoh we got a
[42:42] problem because Abel never had any
[42:46] lineage
[42:49] right
[42:52] right able didn't have no children so
[42:55] you just ended your Doctrine and don't
[42:58] realize
[43:00] it he said brother Dale you're just this
[43:03] that no well be what you want to you
[43:05] tell
[43:07] me cuz you're going to have to jump over
[43:10] able and at least hit to Seth if you're
[43:11] going to start a
[43:12] lineage cuz nothing was carried on in
[43:15] able all right oh it's
[43:18] spiritual
[43:21] okay do what you want to but listen
[43:27] the Covenant was already
[43:29] made with Adam and Eve before the
[43:33] foundation of the world because the
[43:35] Bible says Jesus Christ stood as a lamb
[43:38] before the foundation of the world
[43:40] that's why Adam and Eve that's why Eve
[43:43] was not destroyed immediately when she
[43:45] done something wrong that's right amen
[43:47] for one
[43:49] second in the point of sin and Eve would
[43:51] have been annihilated but the atonement
[43:54] have already been made all right so Adam
[43:57] and Eve wasn't cast out of the garden to
[43:59] a to a
[44:00] separation even in
[44:03] Cain that the Bible says went out from
[44:07] the presence of the Lord but remember
[44:10] before he went out and done what he done
[44:13] God told Cain said you would have been
[44:17] received had you done like Abel now go
[44:20] offer like Abel and it'll be all right
[44:24] and he says I ain't going to do it
[44:26] quoting brother randam he said Cain said
[44:28] I've done what I've done and I do and
[44:32] I'm not going to do anything
[44:35] else cuz
[44:37] remember Eve thought she was right you
[44:40] know what Cain thought he was
[44:43] right it was revealed unto Abel because
[44:46] on the rest of the reading in the in the
[44:48] the Matthew reading on Tru what does it
[44:52] say th AR the Christ the son of the
[44:54] Living God he said Upon This Rock I'll
[44:56] build my church this Revelation and the
[44:58] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[45:01] all right see because it can't stop it
[45:03] because it's Eternal all right
[45:07] now but the point for the day of what we
[45:11] want to get
[45:12] at well let me bring these parts because
[45:15] it do
[45:17] it see in the Bible there in
[45:19] Genesis
[45:21] 3:15 he said I'll put enmity between thy
[45:24] seed and the seed of the woman
[45:26] all right if the seed of the
[45:32] serpent was
[45:34] Satan in his seed of unbelief then it
[45:37] was the promise of the coming of the
[45:40] Messiah because that's what happened at
[45:42] Calvary because if you read it says
[45:45] he'll bruise your head this will bruise
[45:46] your heel so at Calvary that's what took
[45:48] place this Resurrection we talk about of
[45:52] this day come to pass because of the the
[45:56] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ who
[45:59] died for our sins not his own all right
[46:03] and see putting him into the to the
[46:05] point that actually went to hell for you
[46:07] and I because he descended to the to be
[46:10] a witness right is that the scripture
[46:13] right all right then when it does see
[46:16] the promise of the Messiah was there in
[46:19] the garden and I love the way the
[46:21] prophet brought it because you read it
[46:23] and you don't place things in the
[46:24] correct order he said as they were going
[46:26] out of the garden with the Skins
[46:29] flopping upon them of the animals that
[46:31] he had killed for them to make the atoma
[46:34] said he saw them and he realized that
[46:37] the love in his heart could not let the
[46:39] mankind
[46:41] leave how great wonderful would it is it
[46:44] the statements the man would make he
[46:47] said he wasn't going to let him go out
[46:49] said he stopped him and said I'll put
[46:53] enmity between thy seed and the seed of
[46:56] the woman right he said promising that
[46:59] one day the Messiah would
[47:01] come and look where the Messiah would
[47:03] have to come
[47:04] from if you think it was eating apples
[47:07] why didn't he fall off an apple
[47:10] tree right if you think he was eating
[47:13] fruit why didn't he fall off some fruit
[47:15] where did he come from it was necessary
[47:17] that the Messiah come through the wound
[47:19] of a woman that's right right because
[47:21] remember the curse that was put on
[47:23] Eve because of what she done
[47:28] since you he'll multiply your
[47:30] childbearing he'll multiply your sorrows
[47:33] and your desire shall be to your husband
[47:36] and he shall rule over
[47:40] thee but to Adam it didn't put that part
[47:43] it put to Adam that cursed is the earth
[47:46] cuz you're going to make your living
[47:48] you're going to work for a living right
[47:50] all right now so then as following that
[47:53] point think about it
[47:56] the promise of the coming
[47:58] Messiah all right the Christ you
[48:02] remember when we had to drawing up and I
[48:03] told you to make sure you use the word
[48:06] Christ as we were talking about what was
[48:08] over here before and then what came into
[48:11] being or has come into being now in our
[48:14] lives as a manifestation of God all
[48:17] right watching that then if you and I
[48:20] will think about it we can look down
[48:23] through the Bible and see a marvelous
[48:26] situation taking place and I love it the
[48:29] way the prophet said it on Christ the
[48:31] Myster of God
[48:32] reveal he said if you read the Bible you
[48:37] can pull that up brother Anderson if you
[48:38] want to he said if you read the
[48:42] Bible and don't see Christ in every
[48:45] verse now I love
[48:47] that he said go back and read it again
[48:52] see he said c you missed something see
[48:56] the Christ all right in every verse he's
[49:00] the principal thing roll it on
[49:04] up watch what he's a principal theme of
[49:06] the entire Bible if you read the Bible
[49:08] now how wonderful we don't praise the
[49:10] man we praise God who brought the
[49:12] message to the man the man was a man
[49:15] just like you and
[49:17] I if you read the Bible and don't see
[49:19] Christ in every reverse go back and read
[49:21] it again now he didn't say because it
[49:24] would be impossible to read the Bible to
[49:26] see Jesus in every
[49:30] verse so he didn't say that he said you
[49:33] see the Christ in every verse CU Jesus
[49:36] the human flesh was not in the Old
[49:38] Testament you can't use it even in the
[49:41] mzd right because that was just a body
[49:43] spoken into existence and out of
[49:46] existence but see the
[49:48] Christ can you think about the Bible and
[49:51] see the Christ as he would come
[49:54] down
[49:56] can you think about Christ as being the
[49:59] angel of the
[50:03] Covenant the
[50:05] Christ the pillar of fire that led the
[50:08] children of
[50:10] Israel was the Christ you
[50:13] agree the Christ and see that Christ
[50:16] down through the Bible as it will unfold
[50:19] and see him as he the great things that
[50:21] takes place in the Bible of that
[50:24] Christ
[50:26] do you think it was David that killed
[50:31] Goliath uh he told the rock but it had
[50:35] to be the Christ
[50:36] right look back in those and read Christ
[50:40] Myster of God revealed if you will and
[50:42] look at the way the prophet describes
[50:45] it that Christ can be seen in every
[50:48] verse of the Bible if you read
[50:50] it you can see how that those
[50:53] prophets they were the Christ to the
[50:58] people you think about it we'll get more
[51:00] in this afternoon into something to help
[51:02] us a little more understand but look at
[51:06] David look at David and as I said the
[51:09] Christ that would appear there but look
[51:12] at David there's more to the story than
[51:14] just the
[51:15] anointing because
[51:17] David had URI killed and took his
[51:22] wife but remember the story when the
[51:25] Prophet Nathan came to him and said gave
[51:29] him the story about this and one sheep
[51:31] over here and a whole bunch over here he
[51:33] went over and took the one sheep and and
[51:35] David brought his own condemnation he
[51:37] said bring the man here in other words
[51:39] I'll kill him he said let that man die
[51:42] I'll kill him in other
[51:45] words Nathan looked at him and said
[51:47] David Thou Art the
[51:51] man but what did he go on and
[51:54] say
[51:56] he said but David you won't die that's
[51:59] right you won't die he was due to he was
[52:03] supposed to in all righteousness and
[52:06] every form he had brought his own
[52:08] condemnation down upon himself and David
[52:10] knew that don't you think the rest of
[52:12] that man's life he could
[52:16] remember how that he stood in one Split
[52:20] Second he could have been totally
[52:24] annihilated for what he done and would
[52:26] have to call his own
[52:28] judgment as to be righteous of
[52:31] God who was it in all of those Prophets
[52:34] The
[52:36] Christ that's right all right remember
[52:39] what it said was we read dark the Christ
[52:41] the son of the Living
[52:44] God you realize that Peter was
[52:47] saying you are the god of the word
[52:51] because that's what Christ
[52:52] is and all of those Prophets phets spoke
[52:56] of
[52:57] Christ all of those prophets in their
[53:00] actions and their reactions and things
[53:03] look at Moses standing at a burning
[53:07] bush and talking to the one that said I
[53:10] am that I
[53:12] am now Moses you go on down and tell
[53:15] them and said when they want to know
[53:16] who's going to lead them out said tell
[53:18] them I am well that got pretty personal
[53:20] with Moses did it
[53:23] sir come on that King down in in Egypt
[53:26] had a little sense too he knowed better
[53:28] to think that Moses could do any of
[53:30] those
[53:32] things but he knew that he was bringing
[53:34] something that he couldn't deal with he
[53:36] found out real quick right you had never
[53:39] thought about why didn't that King just
[53:40] take out there and say go kill
[53:43] him my goodness Moses walk up there you
[53:45] know let my people go he said go kill
[53:49] him well who's going to keep from he got
[53:51] no Army he got nobody to fight
[53:53] with but that King was
[53:56] afraid because the man he had run into
[53:59] the Wilderness and gave him enough water
[54:01] to be able to survive a day or two had
[54:04] made it and lived through it and 40
[54:06] years later he's walking back standing
[54:08] in front of him and remember Moses that
[54:11] at one time was the head of the
[54:15] army that King was afraid of him but he
[54:18] was really afraid of the fact that
[54:20] something did happen to bring the man
[54:23] back do you see Christ in ever verse of
[54:25] the Bible can you see it in the prophets
[54:28] as they were the way they were
[54:33] doing can you see Joshua as he would
[54:36] take the people
[54:39] across and divide out the land to the
[54:43] people and the things that he was doing
[54:46] can you see Samson in the bases that
[54:49] there he was
[54:50] yeah scrandle of dirty rascal mhm but
[54:59] yet the Christ was there in
[55:04] Samson that he wasn't afraid of nothing
[55:07] that's
[55:08] right because that Christ being there
[55:12] look at all those Old Testament people
[55:14] as they live their lives out and you see
[55:20] Christ Christ leading them look at
[55:24] Abraham and the Covenant that was
[55:27] made and the things that were told of
[55:30] Abraham Abraham met God many different
[55:33] times spoke to him as the form that he
[55:37] was called
[55:40] MDC see he could see the
[55:44] Christ David as we say had already
[55:47] because of the Prophet Nathan had come
[55:50] to him and said you'll be
[55:53] King David when wasn't afraid of no
[55:56] Goliath he wasn't afraid of nothing till
[55:58] he become king he might thought that
[56:00] over in his life and said I don't know
[56:01] what I'll do when I get on the throne
[56:03] but until I get there ain't nothing
[56:05] going to hurt me right cuz I'm under the
[56:08] Christ right Christ is the Angel of the
[56:13] Covenant it says in the book of Acts
[56:15] that he spoke to Moses from the burning
[56:18] bush he led the children of Israel as
[56:20] the pillar of fire and the cloud he was
[56:23] the Christ the son of the Living God
[56:26] then here's a man to introduce
[56:29] him you can see that it had to be a
[56:32] revelation to Peter because he couldn't
[56:34] get it straight to start with and even
[56:36] after seeing the revelation of who
[56:38] Christ was he still denied him yes cuz
[56:41] he was a human being right but when that
[56:44] anointing struck
[56:47] him he said you are the Christ the son
[56:50] of the Living
[56:52] God pull it on over into Luke which Luke
[56:55] is more uh specific look more uh
[57:00] bringing it into a wonderful I love the
[57:02] Book of Luke not that the others are not
[57:05] right they're all right this is the same
[57:07] story but Luke is something because uh
[57:10] you know he even says in his start off
[57:12] when he's reading and Luke was not with
[57:14] the Lord Jesus when he was walking on
[57:16] Earth all right but Luke said having
[57:22] perfect
[57:23] understanding and none of the others
[57:25] said
[57:27] that Matthew Mark John they didn't say
[57:30] it that way Luke is more specific in a
[57:34] detail so when he brought his point out
[57:37] there in Luke he said Thou Art the
[57:40] Christ of
[57:45] God that's the title of the message
[57:47] going into what we using the Christ of
[57:51] God in other words you I don't
[57:54] understand understand it I can't figure
[57:56] it out but something revealed to me is
[58:00] that what Peter was saying that you are
[58:04] the Christ of God all right now the
[58:07] Christ then would be the
[58:11] Creator and that's why you find in John
[58:14] one that declares him to be the
[58:16] Creator who the Christ not the man Jesus
[58:20] the
[58:21] flesh you find it in Hebrews you find it
[58:25] in Colossians all in the first chapter
[58:27] read
[58:27] it and then you find him especially in J
[58:30] is it Ephesians
[58:34] 3:9 where it said all things were
[58:36] created by Jesus
[58:38] Christ and without him there was not
[58:41] anything created Jesus the flesh wasn't
[58:43] back there as a Creator that's right
[58:45] come on Jesus the Christ had to be a a
[58:47] part of the creation he had to be
[58:49] created or brought into being
[58:52] right right cuz the Bible said Hebrews
[58:54] 105 a body thou Hast prepared
[58:58] me all right yes so we can see the
[59:01] Christ then as it's all the way through
[59:03] the
[59:08] scripture we can see him all the way
[59:10] through and seem coming into the
[59:13] Flesh in that body that was dwelling on
[59:16] Earth that we call
[59:20] Jesus we can see the Christ that's right
[59:25] they didn't dare fool with Jesus until
[59:27] God allowed it to happen right that's
[59:30] right not making trinitarianism out of
[59:33] it no they just couldn't take him before
[59:36] his
[59:37] time and you know the fact that we read
[59:39] the resurrection you know the Bible was
[59:41] saved really the resurrection he was
[59:43] barred out of Resurrection until the
[59:45] scripture was fulfilled even though he
[59:47] was the god of the word
[59:51] right come on even though he was the
[59:53] creator himself he could not come forth
[59:55] in the resurrection until the scriptures
[59:57] were fulfilled that's what the Bible
[59:59] says
[1:00:01] right so he was barred out as we used he
[1:00:03] was kept from coming
[1:00:06] forth until the three days was
[1:00:09] completed then he could
[1:00:13] raise and who was he then the
[1:00:17] Christ who is this one that raised on
[1:00:20] the Easter morning let me quote the
[1:00:22] scripture if the spirit that was in him
[1:00:27] be in
[1:00:30] you right if the spirit that was in him
[1:00:34] be in you it'll Quicken your mortal
[1:00:37] body because it was the spirit inside of
[1:00:39] him that raised him up right right and
[1:00:43] that's where it's got to be in you and I
[1:00:46] but are you following
[1:00:48] me
[1:00:50] see God had a plan and a purpose
[1:00:53] according to Christ of mystory of what
[1:00:55] we were reading a while ago a plan and a
[1:00:59] purpose to let him be known or seen and
[1:01:03] and to follow it through the word we can
[1:01:06] see the Christ from the
[1:01:08] beginning we can see him make itself
[1:01:10] manifest in many forms throughout the
[1:01:13] Bible the Old Testament coming forth
[1:01:16] then we can see that
[1:01:18] Christ
[1:01:21] as in a man that was walking on the
[1:01:24] shores of
[1:01:27] Galilee then we can see that
[1:01:29] Christ as the
[1:01:32] anointing right because that's what
[1:01:35] Christ means the anointed or anointed
[1:01:38] one and we can see the day of Pentecost
[1:01:41] when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come
[1:01:42] into
[1:01:45] Mankind and you know what you and I
[1:01:48] become little
[1:01:50] Christ little
[1:01:52] Messiah right
[1:01:55] offspring of God as Paul was talking in
[1:01:58] the book of
[1:02:00] Acts and to see that Christ as it could
[1:02:03] come down and to see that it was
[1:02:07] promised in the end time to come upon a
[1:02:09] bride to bring her to a
[1:02:12] position to change these vile
[1:02:15] bodies the Christ that's right the son
[1:02:20] of the Living
[1:02:21] God now how did we talk about it in
[1:02:26] Genesis that God began to reveal
[1:02:30] himself and use great
[1:02:32] words of
[1:02:35] theophany
[1:02:38] logos but see we look at it to try to
[1:02:41] figure out the Son of
[1:02:44] God and remember the Son of God was the
[1:02:48] creator the
[1:02:50] Christ that's right the son of the
[1:02:52] Living God was a creator thank you Jesus
[1:02:55] all
[1:02:56] right see then why do we have trouble
[1:02:59] with trying to understand we just simply
[1:03:02] go back and listen we just read the
[1:03:06] word so if you have any problem trying
[1:03:08] to figure out who the Creator is let's
[1:03:10] go back and read your Bible John
[1:03:12] 1 plainly says Jesus was a Creator
[1:03:15] Hebrews 1 plainly says it Colossians 1
[1:03:18] about 14 15 right on do a little bit
[1:03:21] brings
[1:03:22] it in James clarifies it by
[1:03:27] saying Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ the son of the Living God the
[1:03:36] Christ the Christ Thou Art the
[1:03:40] Christ see then you can follow Christ
[1:03:43] Through the
[1:03:44] Bible and you can see him as he appears
[1:03:46] in many
[1:03:49] ways you can see him in the fiery
[1:03:51] furnace with Shadrach mesach and in bigo
[1:03:55] we throwed three in didn't we wasn't
[1:03:58] that what the king said and he said
[1:04:00] there's four down there now and he said
[1:04:03] that fourth man is like unto the who Son
[1:04:05] of
[1:04:07] God there was the
[1:04:10] Christ that could come down and dwell
[1:04:13] with
[1:04:14] him he could be with Samson
[1:04:17] Solomon
[1:04:19] David
[1:04:21] Joshua remember Joshua he's he's there
[1:04:24] one day walking around he looks over and
[1:04:26] there understands a
[1:04:28] man well Joshua was a fighter he grabs
[1:04:31] his sword and he heads ice cream because
[1:04:33] he want to know he said are you for us
[1:04:36] or for the enemy if you're for us it's
[1:04:39] okay but if you're for the enemy we're
[1:04:41] going to have a
[1:04:43] fight he said I am not neither one
[1:04:47] paraphrasing in simple language he said
[1:04:49] I'm the God of all things and I've come
[1:04:52] down to take over Joshua fall on his
[1:04:54] knees in front of him cuz he knows who
[1:04:56] that
[1:04:58] is the
[1:05:01] Christ who did all of those prophets see
[1:05:04] and and try to follow after the
[1:05:08] Christ right the
[1:05:14] Christ he came down in human
[1:05:18] flesh because here was John John 1:29 I
[1:05:21] believe it
[1:05:22] is where John the Baptist introduced him
[1:05:26] he said the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:05:30] the sin of the
[1:05:33] world Peter sees him in a higher
[1:05:37] form Matthew writes of
[1:05:41] that because Matthew wrote 16 we read
[1:05:45] you know talking about Peter the AR the
[1:05:47] Christ the son of the Living
[1:05:49] God Luke just sees it in a little higher
[1:05:52] form in his understanding and sees the
[1:05:54] same thing but he calls him the Christ
[1:05:57] the son of the Living God the Christ of
[1:05:59] God that's
[1:06:02] right that anointing has been all the
[1:06:05] way down to there you can follow it all
[1:06:07] the way
[1:06:09] through see it's Christ being revealed
[1:06:12] in the Bible
[1:06:15] right as we read
[1:06:18] it you say well what was in those people
[1:06:20] back there that made them do this that
[1:06:23] and the other the
[1:06:26] Christ the
[1:06:29] Christ he was the one who led the
[1:06:32] children of
[1:06:34] Israel he was in Ezekiel where it speaks
[1:06:37] of a wheel in the middle of the
[1:06:40] wheel and we realize that wheel in the
[1:06:42] middle of the wheel is Jesus Christ
[1:06:44] coming forth into mankind you know
[1:06:46] that's right and we see the children of
[1:06:48] Israel as that that's them as they
[1:06:50] travel because remember the wheels went
[1:06:52] and the the fire chariots and the things
[1:06:55] cared that was Israel in their
[1:06:57] Journey but who was it taking care of
[1:07:02] them he
[1:07:05] said don't you worry about it who was it
[1:07:08] there at the mber
[1:07:11] tree go ahead don't worry about
[1:07:15] it who did he say over to burning bush
[1:07:18] go ahead don't worry about it cuz my
[1:07:21] angel is going to go before you
[1:07:26] and he'll take care of
[1:07:28] everything you know the safest place to
[1:07:30] be in in the days when the three
[1:07:32] children were cast in the fiery furnace
[1:07:34] was in the fiery furnace right even
[1:07:36] though it killed everybody that throw
[1:07:38] them in right read your Bible right that
[1:07:41] was the safest place in the world to
[1:07:47] be Daniel in the lines Den safest place
[1:07:50] that Daniel could be you think anybody's
[1:07:53] going to bother him when did a whole
[1:07:54] bunch of lines down in there he ain't
[1:07:56] nobody going to come down there and harm
[1:07:58] him right but the Christ was
[1:08:02] there who was it that opened the doors
[1:08:04] as Peter was in
[1:08:07] prison and all at once he's outside the
[1:08:10] prison and he looks back and he says oh
[1:08:13] I must be
[1:08:14] dreaming but if I am still how did I get
[1:08:17] out here and if I'm out here I might as
[1:08:20] well just go on
[1:08:21] home he walks home he knocks on the door
[1:08:23] you remember the girl opened the door
[1:08:25] she slammed it back probably in his face
[1:08:27] went running through the house you
[1:08:30] know said Peter spirit is out
[1:08:35] there you know cuz she didn't believe it
[1:08:38] right you know if she didn't believe it
[1:08:39] he'd got out of prison she said it's his
[1:08:42] Spirit she's scared to
[1:08:44] death but you see how would you like to
[1:08:47] be the governor or the ruler of a prison
[1:08:50] and you got outer Court outer guards
[1:08:51] inner guards all kind of guards that's
[1:08:53] going through there and each one of
[1:08:54] those guards if a prisoner got out he
[1:08:57] lost his life
[1:08:59] right that was the law he lost his life
[1:09:03] how would you like to be when you see a
[1:09:05] man standing outside over there that you
[1:09:07] was guarding over him you remember if
[1:09:09] you don't believe the story is right who
[1:09:11] was it which one was it Peter or Paul or
[1:09:13] one that was in in there you know and he
[1:09:15] said don't don't harm yourself the guy
[1:09:17] was fixing to kill himself cuz that's
[1:09:18] the best thing to do cuz it was a
[1:09:20] horrible death for them to kill him he
[1:09:22] was fixing to kill himself he said don't
[1:09:23] don't do that he said we're all still
[1:09:26] here well no wonder the guy wanted
[1:09:30] converted no wonder he wanted to go on
[1:09:32] with
[1:09:33] him because of all the things that had
[1:09:35] happened you see what I'm talking about
[1:09:38] what is it is leading the church
[1:09:40] today the
[1:09:43] Christ the son of the Living God who are
[1:09:47] we if we are The Offspring of God we are
[1:09:51] the Christ of
[1:09:52] God why because the
[1:09:57] anointing is what makes us to
[1:10:01] Christ the anointing the
[1:10:06] Christ what do you think about
[1:10:09] it you said well brother Dale you know
[1:10:11] we we need to know a little bit about
[1:10:13] the Easter of the
[1:10:15] Resurrection that's what I'm talking
[1:10:17] about because after the
[1:10:19] resurrection you remember he raised you
[1:10:21] remember what he said when he was are in
[1:10:24] the the writing and Mary comes up to him
[1:10:27] and he says all right you go tell Peter
[1:10:30] then that I risen from the dead and said
[1:10:34] I'll go before
[1:10:36] you but right before then he told her a
[1:10:39] secret thing that was great that'll tie
[1:10:42] of this afternoon's
[1:10:44] message he said I
[1:10:47] go to your God watch it and my God
[1:10:53] that's
[1:10:54] right that's not
[1:10:57] trinitarianism he said I go to your
[1:11:00] father and my
[1:11:05] father you get over in the Book of
[1:11:07] Romans where we just got through a
[1:11:08] reading and it talks about how
[1:11:11] that the children of God are co-equal
[1:11:14] with
[1:11:16] God I can you be coequal with God you
[1:11:19] can't be but if he makes us that then
[1:11:22] why do we argue back what he's made us
[1:11:24] that's
[1:11:26] right who is it today supposed to be
[1:11:28] doing all of the things who is it
[1:11:30] supposed to be speaking to you today but
[1:11:32] do you take it that way as to be the
[1:11:36] Christ the son of the Living
[1:11:40] God if you don't take it that way you
[1:11:42] then you need to go home and stay at
[1:11:43] home this afternoon CU you you don't
[1:11:45] believe you're going to get anything
[1:11:46] anyway unless you can believe that
[1:11:48] Christ can come down through somebody
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:52] speak well then it's not the person
[1:11:55] anyway it's the
[1:11:57] Christ can I read you want me to where
[1:12:00] brother R said that same Christ is here
[1:12:02] today do you need them they're here in
[1:12:05] the notes the same Christ is here today
[1:12:07] now brother brandham is
[1:12:12] gone well that's your
[1:12:14] Christ no oh my thank you Father the
[1:12:19] Christ he's still here amen amen who's
[1:12:23] going to raise the dead in the last days
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:25] Christ
[1:12:27] right and then we give all honor and
[1:12:29] glory to the
[1:12:31] Christ but now I'm going to make one
[1:12:34] statement and I'm not going to clarify
[1:12:38] it I'm just going to make that
[1:12:44] statement you can have the
[1:12:46] Christ on
[1:12:48] you every day of your
[1:12:51] life and die and go to hell
[1:12:55] hell do you need those
[1:13:00] quotes do you realize it was the cfus
[1:13:03] that was said it he said it was
[1:13:05] necessary that one should die for the
[1:13:06] sins of the people you know what he was
[1:13:08] doing by being high priest he was under
[1:13:10] the
[1:13:11] anointing of the Christ that went with
[1:13:13] the high priest and he prophesied of the
[1:13:15] death of Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ turned around and killed
[1:13:20] him but by being the anointing part it
[1:13:23] was
[1:13:28] there all right see then there must be
[1:13:31] something else to the
[1:13:33] story if you can out the Christ the
[1:13:38] genuine baptism with the Holy
[1:13:41] Spirit on your spirit that's right every
[1:13:44] day of your life and die and go to hell
[1:13:46] I believe that
[1:13:48] right so there must be more to the story
[1:13:51] amen there is than just the
[1:13:54] Christ okay as Paul Harvey says that's
[1:13:56] page
[1:13:58] one we'll get to page two this
[1:14:01] afternoon and talk about is he says the
[1:14:04] rest of the
[1:14:05] story right you remember that when he
[1:14:08] was
[1:14:09] on but think about it what do you think
[1:14:12] about the
[1:14:15] Christ what do you think about the
[1:14:17] Christ come on
[1:14:19] Brothers what do you think about the
[1:14:22] Christ
[1:14:23] if you were asked to introduce Jesus
[1:14:25] what would you introduce him
[1:14:30] as you would have to first introduce him
[1:14:33] as the
[1:14:36] Christ because you can't introduce him
[1:14:39] as the Jesus of back that's a Oneness
[1:14:44] Doctrine you can't introduce him as the
[1:14:47] Jesus of the Old Testament because it's
[1:14:49] not the Jesus of the Old
[1:14:52] Testament
[1:14:54] but you can introduce him as the
[1:14:57] Christ the son of the Living
[1:15:01] God what do you think about him let's
[1:15:04] stand together what do we got brother

[1:17:31] to the doctors we thank God for them we
[1:17:34] do what they say thank you Lord for
[1:17:36] giving them to us but we just tie that
[1:17:39] knot in thy word that says by your

[1:18:53] and touch her and let everything be all
[1:18:56] right because we believe you father in
[1:18:59] Jesus
[1:19:06] name anybody else just have a
[1:19:08] need remember that
[1:19:11] Christ that's the one we're talking
[1:19:16] about that one that's leading us and
[1:19:19] guiding
[1:19:20] us the Christ
[1:19:24] what is our Revelation Thou Art the
[1:19:27] Christ the son of the Living
[1:19:30] God who is he to you today and he says
[1:19:33] who is this son of man that's what was
[1:19:35] there in the scripture we read you
[1:19:39] know he said they aren't the
[1:19:41] Christ he might not have caught the
[1:19:43] whole
[1:19:45] story when you talking about son of man
[1:19:47] but he caught enough of it to hang on
[1:19:49] and build a
[1:19:51] church Church wasn't built on the day of
[1:19:54] Pentecost on son of
[1:19:56] man it was built on Christ amen the son
[1:19:59] of the Living God but in the end time
[1:20:02] it's going to finish upon the son of
[1:20:05] man and who will that son of man be now
[1:20:08] quote brother Brandon who is the son of
[1:20:10] man he said in the beginning was the
[1:20:12] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:20:13] was
[1:20:14] God that's only it's riseing the son I
[1:20:19] think the
[1:20:21] Christ what do you think about
[1:20:24] him see why we honor the resurrection
[1:20:27] because look what all of the
[1:20:28] Resurrection has brought to
[1:20:30] pass into our hearts and our
[1:20:33] lives Lord Jesus we thank
[1:20:37] you thank you for
[1:20:40] raising thank you for dying first for me
[1:20:43] and then raising for my
[1:20:46] justification and to lead us on into Thy
[1:20:49] word that we may walk in the light of
[1:20:51] Your Love thank you for the Christ the
[1:20:55] anointing that truly we love and we
[1:20:59] cherish but we know there's more to the
[1:21:01] story than just to be
[1:21:05] anointed because we could just we could
[1:21:08] be a false
[1:21:11] anointed we could be ones that would be
[1:21:14] even trying but be anointed just upon
[1:21:17] our
[1:21:19] spirit but we want more than that Lord L
[1:21:23] have your way with us as we go to eat a
[1:21:24] natural meal and then be with all and be
[1:21:27] with those traveling back and oh away

[1:21:40] one keep us in Jesus name amen you
