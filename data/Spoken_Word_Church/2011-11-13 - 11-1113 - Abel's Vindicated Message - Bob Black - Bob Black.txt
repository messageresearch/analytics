TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's the last time we were talking about able sacrifice and how that types of the baptism and the holy ghost so we're just going to continue on with this story this this story is really the story of every believer because it tells the story of how we came out of it's like pointing towards your yeah there you go towards your back all right this is um this is the story of how we came out of the nomination and received a revelation from god and how the message was vindicated and our baptism of the holy ghost was vindicated and then uh you know once you once you start talking about that people want to destroy your influence and um so that's that's really what the main topic i want to talk about today is how the message was vindicated and how our lives were vindicated and paralleled with that but let's start from the top with genesis 4 1 and adam knew eve is a wife and she conceived and bear can said i have gotten a man from the lord so we're all familiar with how she she couldn't have gotten the man from satan because satan's not a creator it had to have come from god because god sets laws in the universe and and he put a law into place that um when someone's born you know they come from god so you know what what she's really what really has happened here is eve thought that she she still thought that she was right and um so let me just start getting things started by reading some quotes and the smyrna and church age brother adam said when cain was born she said i've gotten a man from the lord now do you realize that she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of satan instead of the word of god she then thought that whatever she said was right if she said that she had a man from god that she had a man from god but god has set laws in his universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit and the evil seed can bring forth only evil fruit now each seed though different will utilize the same earth nourishment moisture and sunshine but it will bring forth after its own kind so everything started by uh god had a spoken word and satan had a spoken word and that's how everything starts when you start when you receive when you take one word out or add one word to it and it impregnates the womb of your mind and it brings forth actions right so that's really where it all started uh if you look at the statement of eve real close this is also the smartening church age will notice she had more of an understanding than most realized she did not attribute the son to satan for that would have made him equal with god and she believed that cain was from god she accepted the devil's lies the truth of god that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as fountains of truth but the truth is not in them yet their begotten children swear by them and we'll even kill to uphold their error we know there's more than one way to kill you can kill with a sword but you can also kill by destroying one another's influence and that's what you know i think a lot about people that say don't come to this church because of what we teach and they're trying to destroy destroy our influence at the harvest time brother graham said she had a fine education of the truth she didn't know before and it was god's truth but she was dead by breaking the word yeah she got her education all right and you know science tries to tries to prove god by saying well god's got to come our way and that's what that's what education does you know a lot of times when brother brown talks about how education takes you farther from god is because instead of coming to god's provided way they try to say well you got to come our way and we'll set the ground rules if you come our way then we'll accept it and uh i will restore saith the lord brother brown said but through the spirit that he let come upon him you couldn't attach that evil thing of cane upon god so he let the satan's spirit come upon him the spirit of unbelief but every man in this spoken word is the original seed every man no matter whether he's the pope priest bishop whatever he did he is he dies because he's a hybrid that's exactly he was born between satan and eve and they call it whatever you want to it was satan and eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life so it all started because one word taken out let's uh i lost some notes i think i can't skip through reverse two and it's my fault trudy's with me okay and she again bear his brother we're looking at genesis chapter four we're on verse two and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a timber of the ground and cain's children and i greatly solved them this year cain's children were all smart intelligent scientists all down to the days of noah and seth's children were humble farmers sheep raisers peasants all the way through and god hiding in simplicity he said when these other men just dwell in tents and heard their sheep and rested upon the promises of god see see what it was now just follow the genealogy down through and see if that isn't right they rested upon the promise of god uh now the next sorry i'm going a little slow here to get just get started first three and in process of time it came to pass that cane brawl of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord now the thing is when you come to the lord a lot if if you're looking at the the tabernacle when the israelites would come to present their offering to the lord they go into the outer core and then they go into the inner court which represents um coming to church you're fellowshipping with your believers you're doing what god said under the shed blood and a lot of people in in the old testament would kind of think that was the end goal again they forget what the true purpose was was to proceed on into the holy of holies and have fellowship with god and that's really the difference between cain and abel was able wanted fellowship with god and cain had a desire just to just to come to church and present a sacrifice and just kind of that was he he lost sight of what the real goal was was fellowship with god and so when god told when abel and god told him present the sacrifice this you need to do this to come and have fellowship then uh he did like science and said you gotta come my way which is just not right so let's read what brother brown said um making an antidote for sin his father and my mother must have eat fruit as they were taught in that garden now that's how a lot of us were we came through many of you came through denominations or things where you were taught that we taught a lot of things that when the message when you heard the message you received a revelation that pulled you out of that that's how able was when he heard the revelation of god it pulled him up higher than the things that cain was familiar with because they had been taught that it was the fruit right you know i can imagine maybe uh adam and eve were a little bit embarrassed about what happened so they didn't tell them everything that happened in the in the garden everything that happened with the fall so canedin came to all well i'll just bring fruit because that's all i knew but abel got a revelation and so he uh he brought what was required by god and when they came they came to god alone that's how you can't bring your mama and your daddy your pastor you've got to come there's only one door into the holy of holies if you go into that little room you're all by yourself with god it's you and god alone i like this quote tucson thirst this message thirsty priest in tucson now let us look at the thirst and let's see whether actually a thirst is a natural thing i've had people to tell me oh i know i believe it's just for some people to want to be christians oh no that's wrong it's actually something that's associated with every human being and as we're looking through this story pay attention that god called cain he called him and said come and bring your sacrifice and you know a lot of people think that you've got to be uh of us of a certain race certain lineage or a certain genealogy or uh be somehow somehow special but everybody has something in there and that calls him that draws him to worship god he said as long as they are human there's something in them a natural thirst calling out for god somewhere show us the father and he suffices now if an altar is that all that god requires cain was justified and cain made his sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all god wants cain was justified then cain also he built an altar and he worshiped he put a sacrifice on it and he knelt down and worshiped god but god was displeased because he didn't come the right way and the mighty god unveiled before she said is that it is an individual affairs you and god you have to go in not your group not your church not your pastor but it's you who has to go in amen now we talked about verse 4 last time and abel he also brought on the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect and to abel and to his offering now we we learned last time that what happened was abel offered a burnt offering because it was completely consumed by god and we know there's different kinds of offering the peace offering was consumed offered and consumed by the priest the um sin offering was offered and then taken out of the camp and uh and burned but the burn offering is the only one that was completely consumed and when an israelite came and their burnt offering was received and that was a type that showed to them that they were accepted and that represents the baptism of the holy ghost that represents all of the times that we studied how someone would gideon or elijah would bring an offering an abel and they were accepted now what was being accepted here was abel's faith because he believed god and then when he offered his sacrifice it was completely consumed and everybody around that was watching knew that that was the right way to approach to god it was it was public and um it wasn't something he didn't i i just uh printed out a little quote that i found on the internet when i was studying this that uh kind of tell some more about the burnt offering the type involved and complete burning that self-manifests it is consumption of sin nature this is the great promise and prophecy and requirement of every form of the truth the destruction of the body of sin and we were talking about that too how the earth has to be completely cleansed by of sin by the fire of god and our body is going to be cleansed by the rapture by the uh cleansing power of god and it completely destroys sin and that's what the burnt offering is a type of the sin totally destroyed so i wanted to just kind of branch off of that and we're almost out of time we're about halfway through so i got next next sunday too so maybe we'll run over into that but um i got to thinking about how the the burnt offering was public and how cain saw kane could see what had happened so i i wanted to kind of talk about how that this message was also vindicated publicly and when when abel's sacrifice was vindicated it vindicated the message abel's message was you need to blame bring a blood sacrifice and it also vindicated him because he believed it so let's start off with the pillar of fire and think about how imagine how rahab when she was looking out of the windows of jericho she was looking at the children of israel coming through the wilderness the first thing she saw was the pillar of fire brother brendon said now look he said i'll send you a sign there will be a pillar of fire will lead you all the way you just follow it it'll take you that's right and they got right up there and the pillar of fire turned into a man he said i am the captain of the host of the lord said we've come this far now let's go on now um let me let me uh before i get into some of these quotes let me let me just kind of retell some of the the times that the pillar of fire appeared in brother reynolds ministry you know what appeared in his birth on april 6 1909 and then it appeared on the ohio river to announce that he was going to forerun the full run the message you know message before run the second coming and then it appeared in houston coliseum when uh reverend best decided he was gonna he didn't like the healing campaign so he wanted to have a little bit of an argument with and uh brother bossert went to defend brother branham his brother branham didn't want to go and um finally they got brother branham the holy spirit told him it was okay to go down and go down to the platform and when he went down they had hired a photographer with mr ayers to take pictures of reverend best when he shook his fist under the buzzer's face and mr acres was not at all in favor of billy branham he said uh i think i've got a quote in here somewhere this is what mr ayers said brandon puts on a show somehow he never gets around to the cripples and the persons who have arthritis he simply hypnotizes his audience he was not in favor of billy graham at all so when he took all the pictures of of reverend best and he the last one he took was a brother brown when he took him to be developed all of them came out black except for the last one which was a brother branham and the brother branham said right before they took that picture he could hear the pillar of fire coming in with a rush a rushing swing and so they took that picture and the pillar of fire showed up on that last negative and they took it to be analyzed by uh this man who contracted out to the fbi george lacy and he said i can absolutely uh say that it was it was a light it struck the negative there was no light behind the the picture so um when i was 10 years old we went on a trip to the library of congress my family took us on a little field trip and we went to the hall of religious heart to see that picture and you know you'd expect when you go to the hall of religious art it's such a big place that you have to go down we asked them where is the pillar the picture of the pillar fire but around them you'd have to go down all these long rows of pictures and different things to find that they have to find and hunt it out in a little a little spot in the corner so we came up to the desk and said where she asked us what we're looking for and we told her and she said here it is i just pulled it up right there because so many people come came to look for that picture that they had it right there and also it came up missing so many times that they frequently had to reorder who else people would take it down so this is the pillar of fire is not a it was not done in private it was a very public thing everybody knows about it and it vindicates the messenger it also vindicates the believer because the pillar of fire somebody it's not something right you have to have an experience with the pillar of fire pillar fire has to come in you and then when it comes in you it leads you because he said when the comforter comforters come then i will send them to you from the father even the spirit of truth was proceedeth from the father he shall testify on me and he said i have yet many things to say unto you in john 16 but you cannot bear them i'll be when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak for himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you know when jesus asks peter uh who do you say that i am and he said thou art the heart of the christ jesus said blessed art thy son of arjuna for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father is in heaven it's the pillar of fire that leads us and reveals these things to us romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god let's read some more what he said he cares do you care we're almost out of time he's so cared even for a woman that was an outsider not an israelite she didn't belong to the group she was an outsider presbyterian methodist or something she was on the other side when she heard her name was rahab she was living she was a harlot but when she heard how god was in a pillar of fire and was leading them she she said let called out to god and she showed mercy to the supplies that had come to look out the land and because she cared for her and her and her people god cared for her and so much to this harlot that would give her life to christ to the cause because she had seen this sign of a supernatural god and she served her gods right in her own denomination when she seen this great supernatural sign she cried out and asked for mercy and for mercy for her family and god so cared for her that the whole city lapped down one on top of the other but there wasn't one rock moved on her house he cares the third exodus noticed the pillar of fire that called them out led into the promised land under the anointing of a prophet a pillar of fire that they can look at led them to the promised land under anointed prophet and they constantly turn them down that right that let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth come out of it what do you know the same pillar of fire the same anointing spirit leading to the promised land and the third exodus this great angel of the covenant jesus christ in the form of god thought it not robbery but become equal with god now he's a pillar of fire in the same form that he was back there bringing that first texas bringing the second exodus and here he is with the third exodus i was thinking about how i read i don't think i have this quote what brother brendan said with paul one day he met a pillar of fire and what happened next was a pillar of fire led him to a prophet the prophet taught him how to be baptized and what he needed to do amen so if the pillar of fire leads us to the word you know the magi too they saw three stars he said they saw three stars and they came together into one star over the world they were led out of the east to the word think about simeon and anna anna was blind in the temple when when they uh brought she used to be dedicated she couldn't even see but she was led straight to the word a time of decision it's in the religious hall of art in washington dc copyrighted the only supernatural being was ever scientifically proven to be photographed he said i come from god the pillar of fire i returned back to god on the road to damascus paul met him and he was stricken down a great light that put his eyes out and said saul saul why persecuted thou me he said who are you said i'm jesus and here he is with his picture taken among us now cameras don't take psychology the mechanical eye of the camera there's something struck the lens make your decision now if you believe it if he will speak to this young woman just a few more quotes and then one we got the vindicated word of god here vindicating proven by the spirit that he's received us and give us the baptism of the holy ghost we are baptized into the name of jesus christ the same gospel the same signs the same wonders the same ministry even the same pillar of fire visible before the signs and wonders there is not an excuse nowhere so that's where i'll stop today the next thing that rahab saw behind the pillar of fire was the ark of the covenant i'll leave you with that thought
