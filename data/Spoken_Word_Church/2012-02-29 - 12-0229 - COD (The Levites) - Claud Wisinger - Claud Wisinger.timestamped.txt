[3:19] holy holy oh
[3:23] you see
[3:28] hey man God bless each and every one of
[3:30] you it's good to be here tonight uh so
[3:34] if you don't like what I preached blame
[3:35] brother Wade how's that yeah I told him
[3:38] I was coming to Florida for a couple of
[3:40] weeks just to get in the Sun and relax
[3:41] it's been a real tough year back home uh
[3:46] I basically I retired last February
[3:48] remodeled the entire house that me and
[3:50] him to live in went through every room
[3:52] completely redid it and then we decided
[3:55] to buy a church about the time I
[3:56] finished with the house we bought a new
[3:58] church and we had to it used to be a
[4:00] garment Factory is what it was but
[4:02] before that like 30 years before that it
[4:04] was a church right and so it still had
[4:06] the baptistry still had the pastor's
[4:07] office and still had the stage was there
[4:10] and so we got such a good deal on it it
[4:12] was actually honestly it was a miracle
[4:15] that we could get it I told the church
[4:17] two years ago it was the church we were
[4:19] in was getting it was small and we just
[4:21] needed a better facility we've been
[4:23] there for 45 years and I told them I
[4:25] started telling them we need to get a
[4:26] new church I said not if there's
[4:28] anything wrong this but you know it's
[4:30] not the buildings and the nails it's
[4:31] just to make it comfortable have
[4:33] something a little more modern for the
[4:34] people be able to we never had a cry
[4:36] room so when the babies you know start
[4:39] crying whoever sat next to that person
[4:41] was unable to hear the message and so uh
[4:44] I told him two years ago that we really
[4:46] need to look at getting to church
[4:47] finally we voted that that would that's
[4:50] what we all wanted to do we started
[4:51] looking for a church and you know what
[4:53] we didn't have any money to buy a church
[4:55] we had no money I just felt I felt that
[4:58] that was the leadership of the Holy
[5:00] Ghost that we needed to have a new
[5:01] church so what we did
[5:04] uh uh this church come up means either
[5:07] sing it A friend of Irish a real estate
[5:09] agent in town he told us that well we
[5:11] got this one church but he says it's
[5:12] pretty bad shape so Ginger told me she
[5:14] said well let's go look at it I said
[5:16] okay let's go look at it so went over
[5:18] there looked at it when you walked in
[5:19] the door you just knew it was right you
[5:20] know what I mean it just it was right I
[5:22] could just feel that it was right but
[5:24] anyway we would have had 25 000 to put
[5:26] down we didn't have 25 000. we did not
[5:28] have it and so finally I called the
[5:31] realtor I said I'll tell you what if I
[5:33] give you a 25 000 letter of a write-off
[5:36] to say I'll give him 25 show that he
[5:39] gave 25 000 toward the purchase because
[5:41] he's he's wanting so much so we took and
[5:44] he did it and that was our down payment
[5:45] so I went to the bank and I told the
[5:48] bank I said uh well we you know we want
[5:51] to buy this church and so the bank said
[5:53] well how much do how much do they want
[5:54] for it and I told him he said how much
[5:56] are you going to pay for it and it was
[5:58] 25 000 left he made me he didn't charge
[6:00] me a dime and then they told us at the
[6:02] club the thing he said now when we close
[6:04] on this it's going to cost you around
[6:05] the realtor had figured it up yeah and
[6:08] he said it's gonna cost you 5 000 at the
[6:10] time in the closing we went to the
[6:12] closing me and my wife and they wrote us
[6:14] an 800 and some dollar check
[6:17] this is not right you know but this is
[6:20] God is what it is
[6:24] we were going to take every penny that
[6:26] we had to remodel the church so you know
[6:28] what it allowed us to do since we didn't
[6:30] have to have the down payment things we
[6:32] were able to go ahead and get into
[6:34] church uh and we had our weeknight
[6:36] service in it on January 1st and it was
[6:39] a real real blessing it really was so uh
[6:42] God's still Miracle work now yeah I can
[6:44] tell you that but for me it's been a
[6:46] little hard working on a house working
[6:47] on a church preaching three times a week
[6:49] you know how it goes and uh but we we've
[6:53] got we've accomplished a lot at
[6:54] Bartlesville and things are really good
[6:56] doing good for us so uh just continue to
[7:00] pray for us we're a simple people uh but
[7:03] you know what we love the Lord with all
[7:05] of our hearts behind the stream and you
[7:08] know what we're in the final part of
[7:10] this thing and we need to start pushing
[7:12] you know Paul said that we need to press
[7:14] toward the mark on the high calling in
[7:16] Christ Jesus if there's ever a time you
[7:19] need to press right right okay don't set
[7:22] on your laurels and think everything
[7:23] things gonna be okay that's right
[7:25] because the bride does have something to
[7:27] do that's right you're supposed to make
[7:29] yourself ready right amen the bride hath
[7:31] made herself ready is that right so
[7:33] there is something you need to do okay
[7:35] let's return to the scripture and read
[7:37] and I've been actually teaching a series
[7:40] uh when I first started ministering
[7:42] brother Samuel and brother Wade both
[7:43] were a real help to me and I told him I
[7:45] said I don't know how you guys do a
[7:47] series you know well I'm now on the 50th
[7:50] sermon out of cod so it's it's it's not
[7:53] how you do it just God works again it's
[7:55] a gift that does it okay so anyway let's
[7:58] go to Genesis 5 and 24 if you would
[8:00] we'll start with some simple scriptures
[8:01] and I try to show you something and uh I
[8:05] preached four sermons out of this this
[8:07] subject I'm going to bring tonight
[8:08] hopefully I can we'll get through it
[8:10] okay and I hope not to hold you too long
[8:12] because I know Wednesday nights I know
[8:14] how hard it is on your body Genesis 5
[8:16] and 24 and Enoch Enoch was the seventh
[8:20] from Adam right we're the seventh Church
[8:22] age so we're going to take a rapture all
[8:24] right right and eat off the wall walk
[8:27] you know what walk to us this man are
[8:29] alive right Enoch had a conda right he
[8:33] had a manner of life right he walked
[8:35] with God and he was not for God took him
[8:38] right is that right let's go to Hebrews
[8:41] 11 and 5 now
[8:48] foreign
[8:54] Enoch was translated that he should not
[8:56] see death and was not found because God
[9:00] had translated him for before his
[9:03] translation does everybody understand
[9:04] that before he got raptured out that's
[9:06] right he had this testimony you know
[9:10] what the word testimony means good
[9:12] report right see you're not going to get
[9:14] to heaven God say Well done my good and
[9:16] faithful servant if you haven't done
[9:18] good right and that word faithful means
[9:20] full of faith is that right so you gotta
[9:22] understand that Enoch please God and it
[9:25] was this testimony that pleased God Amen
[9:28] he walked he walked the walk do you
[9:31] understand that he had a good report
[9:33] before God and you know what that he
[9:36] pleased God Amen so if you're going to
[9:39] take a Rapture as Enoch did you're going
[9:41] to have a good report right is that
[9:43] right false report but a good report
[9:46] right let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[9:48] father we thank you for the reading the
[9:50] word Lord I pray that I'll get myself
[9:52] out of the way and may you come and
[9:53] minister to the hearts of this people oh
[9:55] God lord we understand in this end time
[9:58] there's no great ones Among Us it's just
[10:00] you Lord you're the one that we looked
[10:02] forward to Lord look toward so be with
[10:05] us and break this down for the people
[10:06] Lord and is Christ's name we ask it amen
[10:09] we might be seated you have that chart
[10:11] right there you can put up
[10:36] God's good too amen I got a little
[10:40] church all the time I said don't get
[10:41] nervous I'm not nervous
[10:43] you know uh my brother Jess our old
[10:45] Pastor passed away now I used to watch
[10:47] him in the Pulpit when you think of
[10:48] Bible it'll keep you going like this
[10:57] he does but everybody see that okay
[11:01] yeah okay
[11:03] everybody understands the the
[11:05] Church age or the conduct order and
[11:07] Doctrine book are 23 messages that
[11:10] someone I believe it might have been Roy
[11:12] borders put together is that right right
[11:15] 23 messages and they believe that in
[11:18] these 23 messages and I don't really I'm
[11:20] not going to argue the fact I believe
[11:21] they're right that the conduct the order
[11:23] and the doctrine of the church just
[11:25] stated in those 23 messages yeah that
[11:28] fair to say right that's what they did
[11:29] this is what I did so we always call it
[11:32] the church right is that what we always
[11:33] say right we go Church conduct order and
[11:37] Doctrine right yeah amen you know three
[11:40] everything's perfected in three years
[11:42] does everybody agree with that amen so
[11:44] you've got conduct you got order
[11:47] and you got Doctrine right
[11:49] so I preached a message and I say you
[11:51] know really we're not church anymore
[11:52] we're Pride amen so I X this out okay
[11:56] let's get rid of that is that right
[11:58] let's go brag right so this is in order
[12:02] for you to be perfect can I just tell
[12:03] you this you got to have your contacts
[12:06] you got to have your order you gotta
[12:07] have your doctor
[12:08] and that's how you're going to be made
[12:10] that's how you're going to be like Enoch
[12:13] where you walk you have a manner of life
[12:15] that is pleasing to God all right is
[12:17] that right and that's your
[12:18] responsibility as being a bride member
[12:20] you need to walk the walk you need to
[12:23] walk a walk to where you absolutely are
[12:25] pleasing to God Almighty amen right is
[12:28] that right now this is what most people
[12:30] have in the message of the hour
[12:34] well yeah
[12:35] does everybody agree that right you know
[12:37] Paul said you can know all the Mysteries
[12:39] exactly hey you don't have love right
[12:43] you're like a symbol you just make a lot
[12:45] of noise is that right what we got
[12:47] around the message is a lot of noise we
[12:49] got a lot of people that know the
[12:50] doctrine I have people in in my church
[12:52] I'll be honest with you they say I
[12:53] believe the message and they live none
[12:55] of it that's right amen you know brother
[12:57] random said your life speaks louder than
[12:59] your words exactly that's what he said
[13:01] he said if you don't live it you don't
[13:03] believe it right right so you know what
[13:06] you can tell you can talk to me all you
[13:08] want tell me how much you believe this
[13:09] message but if you don't your manner
[13:11] alive
[13:12] is not according to all these right here
[13:15] you bear false witness right right did
[13:17] you know that then you're bearing false
[13:19] witness there's a sermon if you go
[13:21] through conduct order Doctrine run up
[13:23] said your life interprets this message
[13:25] right the word does everybody understand
[13:27] that right though everyday life that you
[13:30] live brother is what interprets it so if
[13:32] there's one quote in this message that
[13:35] you're that you don't live up to right
[13:37] then you misinterpreted amen exactly you
[13:39] know on that day you're going to be held
[13:41] accountable for misinterpreting the word
[13:43] you can quote it all you want but if you
[13:46] don't put some flesh on that club see we
[13:49] believe in the son of man ministry right
[13:51] we believe we're Ace on a man just like
[13:53] brother Branham was revealing the son of
[13:55] man is that right will you say you're a
[13:57] son a man which is a word made flesh I
[13:59] believe that but if your men are alive
[14:02] is not according to this message your
[14:04] life is speaking louder than your words
[14:06] your confession has no weight with me
[14:09] you understand your confession don't
[14:11] scare the devil one bit exactly but when
[14:13] you get down where the rubber meets the
[14:15] road and you live a life yeah amen then
[14:18] that scares you because you know what
[14:19] that life is an interpretation of this
[14:22] message amen that we say we believe so
[14:25] you can find out go read conduct
[14:26] daughter and Doctrine and see if you
[14:29] really believe the message of that can I
[14:31] say it that way exactly now I know
[14:33] that's tough you know the thing about a
[14:36] pastor that's a harder you know when
[14:37] you're and I know most of you some of
[14:39] your parents here anyway what you'll say
[14:40] the hardest thing you do is with your
[14:42] children all right you know that's what
[14:44] a pastor's job is right yeah I had
[14:47] somebody in the church the other day
[14:48] this sister she goes and she said we got
[14:50] a fellowship Paul now which has been
[14:52] real good for us but she's back here and
[14:54] saying well I told my kids that when
[14:56] they reached 17 years old they can do
[14:58] what they want to do they're old enough
[14:59] to make their own decision
[15:00] show me that in the message would
[15:03] somebody help me and show me it don't
[15:05] matter if your daughter's 40 years old
[15:06] if she lives with you under the token
[15:09] amen you don't let her come in your
[15:10] house living dirty Billy Paul came up to
[15:13] the house one day smoking a cigarette
[15:15] right he walks up here and he puts it
[15:18] out on the fence post he goes up to the
[15:19] door and brother bam standing there he
[15:21] said
[15:21] Paul you can't live here doing that all
[15:24] right why brother Branham applied the
[15:26] token on the house so this sister said
[15:28] you know when they're 17 they're old
[15:30] enough that you'll make and you know
[15:32] what she's got several kids and most of
[15:34] them are wearing pants and living with
[15:36] them
[15:37] do you know the neighbors going to see
[15:39] them kids walking in the house and after
[15:41] you've told them we don't believe in
[15:43] women wear pants and not cutting their
[15:44] hair you're allowing your kids to do it
[15:45] right see your life speaks louder than
[15:48] your world and when I and I got up from
[15:50] the church I said okay in the days of
[15:52] Paul does everybody understand the
[15:54] Antichrist Spirit went out amen you know
[15:56] brother bear said the Antichrist Spirit
[15:57] was a saying that went out right exactly
[16:00] so that sister was that was a saying
[16:02] that she
[16:04] as a pastor I was obligated so she cast
[16:06] it out over the in the fellowship hall
[16:08] everybody there I got the pulpit I said
[16:10] show me that
[16:11] I'll show you where brother Branham said
[16:13] that sister when your husband's away
[16:15] You're the pastor of the house right
[16:17] what would you do if this man was pastor
[16:20] this church
[16:21] okay and all his children come in
[16:23] wearing pants yeah wouldn't you talk to
[16:25] them wouldn't you blow it out and tell
[16:27] them you can't do that right you were
[16:29] raised under this message you know
[16:31] better you can't come here like that
[16:32] wouldn't you say that right well she's
[16:34] the pastor of the home and she's going
[16:36] to let that 17 year old kid make a
[16:38] decision right you know and and when
[16:41] when you pray I looked at when he
[16:42] preached on Two Souls which I'll I'll
[16:44] tell you it was wonderful amen I enjoyed
[16:46] it I mean I I thoroughly I enjoyed that
[16:48] message that he preached okay but
[16:52] do you know that if brother Graham said
[16:54] if you'll take a child and you won't do
[16:55] nothing with it you won't correct him or
[16:57] not corrected you do nothing that that
[16:59] child will pervert
[17:00] because why wrong birth amen the child's
[17:04] birth is wrong in the first place he's
[17:06] going to go wrong is that right
[17:08] and that's the point he was making what
[17:09] is it it was got perverted right but
[17:12] through our new birth
[17:14] it's converted not perverted is that
[17:17] right so when I did I had to preach that
[17:20] over the congregation I knew the sister
[17:23] was there but you know what being a
[17:24] pastor I have to correct it right
[17:26] because why that's a saying that when it
[17:28] went through the church somebody would
[17:29] have heard that and said you know what
[17:31] when my kid gets 17 I'm gonna let him do
[17:33] that right and you may say well brother
[17:35] Clyde you really be no I'm not that's
[17:38] what Paul was getting out when he said
[17:39] these sayings went out right is that
[17:42] right it was just simple things that you
[17:44] say that you can't find in a message you
[17:46] better quit saying it right
[17:48] better get your
[17:49] get your doctor order and you've been
[17:51] all lined up is that right no I believe
[17:54] in Doctrine I'll be honest with you I
[17:56] preach the doctrine of the message all
[17:58] right man brother Graham said the
[17:59] doctrine is the Bark on a tree if you
[18:01] don't have the bark on the tree the life
[18:03] will run out exactly so is the doctor an
[18:06] important yes but what we've got is a
[18:08] lot of people in the message that's got
[18:10] the doctrine and no conductor do you
[18:13] know if you don't have order the
[18:14] opposite of orders
[18:16] is that right if you don't have a
[18:19] conduct of it why like I say you you've
[18:22] seen people I mean you've seen women
[18:24] wear heels like that oh yeah you've seen
[18:27] all these things but what is it it's a
[18:29] misinterpretation of the message so in
[18:32] the day how are you going to make a
[18:34] Rapture how is your life how's your
[18:36] Manor life going to be pleasing to God
[18:37] that's right does everybody agree with
[18:39] that right so this is what everybody's
[18:41] missing in the message right this is
[18:44] where they think oh you know what we
[18:46] have Abraham as our father yeah we have
[18:48] brother Branham as our Prophet isn't
[18:50] that what they said yeah yeah what was
[18:52] it Jesus Christ was the interpretation
[18:55] of all the prophets all that the
[18:58] prophets spoke of Jesus Christ he was
[18:59] sitting there conducting himself
[19:01] according to that word right and they
[19:03] hated him for it they hated his conduct
[19:06] they hated his order they hated his
[19:08] Doctrine is that right you go look at
[19:11] Jesus ministry he had it all lined up he
[19:13] had every bit of this right here lined
[19:15] up is that right everyone
[19:17] the prophet spoke of him was made flesh
[19:20] right is that right and he was doing
[19:22] with the what all the prophets said
[19:24] right well Brethren said for the bride
[19:26] it's the same way do you know there's a
[19:28] portion of scripture that's written
[19:29] about you and you have to have the
[19:31] conduct the order and the doctrine of it
[19:33] right right but people in a message an
[19:36] hour and they think because they're this
[19:37] big shock believer they don't have to
[19:39] have any conduct you know what I mean
[19:42] right and I've heard people I'll be
[19:45] honest I've heard preachers say well you

[19:48] clothesline around here
[19:50] and their women will have heels like
[19:52] that right
[19:54] do you understand what I'm saying their

[21:05] everybody agree with that exactly do you
[21:07] realize that TV is a product of the
[21:09] fourth dimension right amen

[21:34] make it when the sister said how are we
[21:35] gonna make the Rapture like Enoch right
[21:37] right pray and read your Bible every day

[21:51] believe that you gotta be no
[21:53] he said live a ABC everyday Christian
[21:56] Life pray read your Bible amen what is
[21:59] that conduct there's what the people in
[22:02] the message have gotten away from amen
[22:04] okay now you I'll let your profit can I
[22:07] read some quotes we'll just do it okay
[22:10] masterpiece
[22:13] 640705. now here is the interpretation
[22:15] thereof the reason now remember I had
[22:18] just got through writing I hadn't
[22:20] finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet
[22:22] but in preaching this morning I caught
[22:24] what it was right in my sermon did you
[22:26] notice the church only came in view now
[22:29] that's the truth friends the heavenly
[22:31] father who writes the word knows that I
[22:32] tell the truth I know say the truth and
[22:35] not knowing it until just a few minutes
[22:37] ago looked like or just recently see did
[22:41] you notice the bride coming in view
[22:42] twice the first seed and the second seed
[22:45] both of them exactly the same one amen
[22:48] and the reason they were dressed in
[22:50] different parts she'll come from All
[22:51] Nations
[22:53] right okay it'll make up the bride each
[22:56] one had long hair no makeup and real
[22:59] pretty girls it's either conduct
[23:01] they were watching me
[23:04] they were looking you know the messenger
[23:06] and the messenger are one all right the
[23:07] message and the messenger one is that
[23:10] right and it had their eyes on the
[23:11] messenger what did they have their eyes
[23:13] on the message is that right so listen
[23:15] what's it that represented the bride
[23:18] coming out of all Nations each one
[23:20] represented a nation they marched
[23:22] perfectly in line with the word all
[23:24] right
[23:25] and then I have to watch her she'll get
[23:28] out of step with that word right okay if
[23:31] I don't watch when she's passing by let
[23:33] me go on down I'm not a Jehovah Witness
[23:35] I can't read very long I don't like you
[23:37] but I can let me hit the main point they
[23:40] was getting back okay
[23:43] they was getting in line because they
[23:45] was looking out somewhere else right
[23:47] okay watch about that church that just
[23:51] went out into chaos
[23:53] the church went out into chaos they
[23:56] didn't have this right right that's the
[23:58] opposite of this is that right amen okay
[24:00] so they went to chaos the front ones I
[24:03] the back ones just two or three of them
[24:05] was kind of stepped out of a little bit
[24:07] to the right hand side it looked like
[24:09] was trying to get back in line as they
[24:11] went by they was just passing me oh
[24:15] Forest here to the wall passing me I was
[24:18] standing there and then I just seen them
[24:20] all just move out and leave but you
[24:22] notice the church only came to view once
[24:24] right but the bride and twice is that
[24:27] right amen and he said let the Bride As
[24:30] she starts getting out of Step he says
[24:32] your bride's getting out of stairs is
[24:34] that right he was the ones on the back
[24:35] road yeah two or three of them on the
[24:37] back is that what he said we're getting
[24:39] out of step is that right from this that
[24:42] I'll step from this and that yeah they
[24:45] she come back in the step as the vision
[24:48] showed a few weeks ago right now is that
[24:51] right right this is where we're out of
[24:53] step is our conduct
[24:55] see what made Enoch take a Rapture is
[24:57] his manner of Life please God right
[25:00] Gloria is that right what happened some
[25:02] people in the grind got their eyes off
[25:05] the prophet off the message and their
[25:08] conduct they got out of step and they
[25:10] calmed up started getting all messed up
[25:12] is that right right amen and like I told
[25:14] you your life is an interpretation of
[25:16] this message right and if I was to
[25:19] preach at our church and I'm preached
[25:21] against TV and they come into my house I
[25:23] had a TV my life right would be a
[25:26] misinterpretation of what I'm preaching
[25:28] right and it causes confusion right I
[25:31] mean I've heard it over and over again I
[25:33] preached something Church they say well
[25:34] so and so in your church does that
[25:36] yeah yeah you see what I'm saying
[25:38] they're out of steps right and when you
[25:40] get out of Step what is it your life
[25:42] causes a misinterpretation of the word
[25:44] right you better get instead amen is
[25:47] that right you better go look if brother
[25:49] man said pray and read your Bible every
[25:51] day what you need to do you need to get
[25:53] your eyes back on the message all right
[25:54] what we've done in this hour we've taken
[25:56] our eyes off the message the bride right
[25:58] is that right we need to get our eyes
[26:00] back on the message and start getting
[26:02] back instead amen is that right it is
[26:05] sued listen to the quote as soon as she
[26:08] got back in Step what happened
[26:11] so what was the last thing that the
[26:13] bride needed to get in order for conduct
[26:15] right she has her Doctrine right we've
[26:18] got the order right right but the
[26:20] trouble is our conducts what's holding
[26:21] this up right man what did Brother
[26:23] Randolph say was going to hold up the
[26:24] Rapture the Readiness of the Bride
[26:27] exactly amen and in that quote and you
[26:29] look at it the last thing she was out of
[26:31] Staff her conduct wasn't right do you
[26:34] understand her life wasn't in order
[26:36] right that's what the bride needs to do
[26:38] we need to get back under the microscope
[26:40] of the message and see where we're out
[26:42] of step right and then get back into
[26:44] step is that okay is that okay okay and
[26:48] I'm gonna move off of that now and we'll
[26:50] move on to the subject that I really
[26:51] want to preach I had to get warmed up
[26:53] yeah amen I'm not like I'm not like
[26:55] brother Julie helicopters up helicopters
[26:57] down I'm like a C-130 transport I'm a
[26:59] big old boy I gotta go slow I get it up
[27:02] there and then I'm going to come down
[27:04] slow again okay but we're gonna get
[27:06] there all right well I want to tie with
[27:08] today is cod the Levites
[27:12] the Levites that's a weird one isn't it
[27:15] now don't go crazy on me I know the
[27:17] levitical priesthood's over with I know
[27:19] we're in the Melchizedek priesthood
[27:21] which is the son of man okay can you
[27:23] understand that that's right we're in a
[27:25] Melchizedek priesthood but do you under
[27:27] understand that the Old Testament was
[27:28] given to us for shadows and Tides amen
[27:31] right you know brother Ram said an
[27:32] adoption book in the last book he said
[27:34] if you're not a typologist you won't
[27:36] understand the scriptures right he said
[27:38] if you're not you know I've heard some
[27:40] people make fun of it and I've seen some
[27:42] guys go off on typo like we were talking
[27:44] today we'll have a certain license plate
[27:46] no type that you'll drive a certain car
[27:48] they'll type that now that's ridiculous
[27:51] yeah can I tell you that that's not the
[27:53] type of typologist I'm talking about a
[27:56] typologist I'm talking about you've got
[27:57] to understand that in the Old Testament
[27:59] there were shadows and types that were
[28:01] given amen and I could take those
[28:03] because that was Jehovah the old is
[28:05] Jesus Christ of the new right amen amen
[28:07] so I can take these shadows and tights
[28:09] being a typologist and bring them to an
[28:12] everyday something that happens in your
[28:14] life is that right amen so I want to
[28:16] read a quote now that brother Branham
[28:17] said about the Levites because we want
[28:19] to know what kind of don't we really do
[28:21] you want to know what kind of conduct
[28:23] you're supposed to have amen all right
[28:24] don't we want to know that if that if
[28:26] that group of people on the back row and
[28:29] you know what I don't know about you but
[28:30] this is the last stage this is the last
[28:32] course right this is the back row some
[28:35] of them got out of step right so what we
[28:37] want to do is we want to get our conduct
[28:39] in order I believe you guys I I've heard
[28:41] I've heard this brother preach I would
[28:43] never say he's off in his Doctrine are
[28:45] you kidding me I'd be nuts I know he's
[28:48] got the right doctor I know I got
[28:49] through I know brother Wade's many of
[28:51] the preachers in the message you have to
[28:52] write Doctrine but the trouble is the
[28:54] conduct of the people so bad amen I mean
[28:57] they their their life speaks louder than
[28:59] their words right isn't that what he
[29:01] said I mean you say you believe the
[29:04] message but I can pick up a message but
[29:06] it don't take me long to see your life
[29:09] is not interpreting the message of the
[29:10] hour your life is is chaos your life is
[29:15] not a conduct that is according to this
[29:18] message that hour so what we need to do
[29:20] is we need to get ourselves our conduct
[29:22] in order exactly and it's not all that
[29:24] remember it takes all three right right
[29:26] I'm do it away with Doctrine you
[29:29] understand like I said while ago it's
[29:31] the bar that holds the life in a tree
[29:32] very important your order is very
[29:35] important right
[29:37] amen and your conduct is important and
[29:39] when you get those three in line
[29:40] remember Brothers
[29:42] when you get them all in line
[29:45] no that's the way it is that's what he
[29:47] said by the message is that right so let
[29:50] me read you something here and I want to
[29:51] show you let me just quote I'm terrible
[29:54] I can't hardly read anything anymore I
[29:56] just want to preach you know what I mean
[29:57] I tell people I'm not into Jehovah's
[29:59] Witness I'm not a reader all right they
[30:01] get up and just read yeah you know I'm
[30:03] not just going to get up and quote
[30:04] quotes and read all the time I got to
[30:07] get up and minister to you break it down
[30:09] is that right that's what the preacher's
[30:11] supposed to do that's right but there's
[30:13] a quote and I want to read it here I'm
[30:15] going to read it now I mean let me see
[30:16] if I got like two sets of notes I
[30:18] actually preached four services on this
[30:20] back home okay
[30:22] you start being preaching about contacts
[30:24] you know people get bored they don't
[30:26] want to do that part yeah that's right
[30:29] they don't see the importance or the
[30:31] relevance of it you know what I mean
[30:32] they don't but let me tell you it's very
[30:34] relevant amen right amen your conduct is
[30:37] your interpretation of this message
[30:40] it is exactly right amen it's your man
[30:42] in our life is that right yeah so don't
[30:45] kid yourself it's important man I have
[30:47] these printers just want to hold on
[30:48] don't get nervous I'm not nervous all
[30:50] right I'll fumble around for a minute
[30:51] I'll get there
[30:53] thank you
[30:55] I'm not 24 pages of notes it's
[30:57] ridiculous how many notes yet I still
[30:59] like if I don't have 20 pages of notes I
[31:01] just you know I get nervous but I never
[31:03] hardly read them I just got them there
[31:05] yeah let me read some Jesus Christ the
[31:07] same yesterday now notice then the first
[31:09] thing you know when he noticed him and
[31:12] see him come and astonish the man
[31:14] now if you'll notice what a strange
[31:15] thing it was when all those Hebrews then
[31:18] when they sing remember staunch men
[31:20] renowned men holy men scholars in the
[31:23] Bible you couldn't lay one Hound on her
[31:25] life and say they wasn't holy they kept
[31:28] the Commandments of God just as true as
[31:30] could be kept they were holy they didn't
[31:33] do one thing day or night you know what
[31:35] they did they eat sweet and read the
[31:37] scriptures yeah
[31:38] pretty good huh yep well the ram said
[31:41] you pray read your Bible every day
[31:44] right they had to be born in a certain
[31:46] lineage before they could be a priest or
[31:49] a teacher the Levites does everybody
[31:50] agree with that yeah and they said this
[31:52] handed down their fathers handed down
[31:54] the Scrolls the laws they studied it day
[31:57] and night Glory okay now can I read uh
[32:02] the next quote this was a question's
[32:04] answers on COD now one thing there was
[32:06] sin in Israel and there was a man by the
[32:09] tribe of the name of Levi
[32:11] you know what Levi means accompanies him
[32:16] they pulled their swords and they went
[32:19] with Moses to the camp right and they
[32:20] destroyed everything that was sinned
[32:22] right in the camp and you know they
[32:24] killed their sons their old Sons their
[32:26] own daughters right their own Brothers
[32:27] their own sisters and those Levites if
[32:30] there was sin in the camp they drew
[32:31] their sword and they killed it right
[32:33] does everybody understand that yeah
[32:35] sir okay not going let's see
[32:38] God looked down and said because you did
[32:40] this and stood for me
[32:43] all these others will serve you you go
[32:46] right into the temple as priests is that
[32:48] right you stay right in the temple and
[32:51] the rest of them will work and will
[32:53] bring in a tent and take care of you
[32:54] amen with it yeah okay listen to what it
[32:58] says okay
[33:04] is that right oh Hallelujah if you can
[33:06] see
[33:10] that the Levites was the bride right man
[33:13] sure
[33:14] have you ever heard that before it might
[33:16] have I don't know if you have the
[33:18] Levites
[33:19] was the bride
[33:21] you know the Levites had to have a
[33:22] certain birth you know exactly
[33:27] is everybody okay with that right right
[33:29] so when you go read the Old Testament
[33:31] now when you read about those Levites
[33:32] that types you right they had to have a
[33:35] certain conduct come on did they hey man
[33:38] you read the Old Testament did they yeah
[33:40] man they had to have a certain type is
[33:43] that right you know the Levites were
[33:45] never numbered right that's right it's
[33:47] the bride number
[33:49] it's a number no American number right I
[33:53] could take and show you through the Old
[33:54] Testament you read every quote on the
[33:55] levite that types you all right man you
[33:58] know what your responsibility is to draw
[34:00] your sword and take all the sin out of
[34:02] the camp man not just him right right
[34:05] that's right you that's right right amen
[34:09] your brothers your sisters right your
[34:12] children you're supposed to kill sin out
[34:14] of the camp amen glory right if you let
[34:16] that sin stay there it's gonna sire the
[34:19] whole thing right does everybody
[34:20] understand that hey man so this is what
[34:23] happened let me go back and I want to
[34:24] explain in the Old Testament you
[34:26] remember when Moses went up on the
[34:28] mountain to get the Commandment
[34:29] s the children is or when he came down
[34:31] he said what's that noise and when he
[34:34] come down there do you know the people
[34:35] in the scripture says they were dancing
[34:37] naked around that golden cow that's
[34:39] right right did you know they were naked
[34:41] yeah
[34:42] pretty disgusting don't you think but
[34:44] you know who stripped them out Aaron
[34:46] right exactly Aaron wouldn't correct it
[34:48] all right and Moses looked at and said
[34:51] what is wrong he said well the people
[34:53] wanted something so I gave him a golden
[34:54] calf yeah is that what he said yeah and
[34:57] the people were dancing around that calf
[34:59] naked the scripture says that are they
[35:02] naked laodicea who strips them down
[35:05] right the preachers amen when you go out
[35:08] and lay over the sin you see these
[35:09] people all stripped down you know who
[35:11] did it the preachers did it that's right
[35:12] amen the preachers had done it why they
[35:15] won't preach the conduct that's what we
[35:17] got wrong in a lot of message churches
[35:19] preachers won't preach the conduct
[35:20] they'll preach the doctrine but they
[35:23] won't preach the conduct it takes all
[35:25] three to get you out of here man right
[35:26] okay so we don't just need the doctrine
[35:29] we need the conduct to go along with the
[35:31] dog but that's going to straighten you
[35:33] up where we can get out of here is that
[35:35] right so keep in mind as I'm gonna read
[35:37] about the Levites and a lot of people
[35:39] don't understand about the Levites but
[35:41] the Levites come and they stood with
[35:43] Moses amen have you stood with William
[35:45] Branham so are you a Levi
[35:51] if somebody comes in with a spirit in
[35:54] this church that it is not the conduct
[35:56] according to this message right now you
[35:59] got to use some wisdom you don't let
[36:00] somebody the first time they come
[36:01] through the back door just bam right you
[36:03] know come on use some sense about it but
[36:06] what you're going to do is you're in
[36:07] love
[36:08] you're going to correct that thing is
[36:10] that right you're going to take the word
[36:11] The Sword and cut it out of the
[36:13] congregation and if a pastor lets that
[36:15] thing continue to grow then he's going
[36:17] to be responsible for it amen the pastor
[36:19] has a big responsibility is that right
[36:21] right so the Levites their life if you
[36:24] read everything about a Levi it's a type
[36:26] of you man I'm gonna Draw Something on
[36:29] the board here I don't know if you've
[36:30] ever seen it before but it's pretty
[36:32] amazing when you really look at it okay
[36:34] so the levite has to be born a certain
[36:36] way right misconduct has to be a certain
[36:38] exactly do you know if he approached
[36:40] look at Aaron's sons did they die yeah
[36:42] right they didn't handle the firework
[36:44] was their conduct supposed to be a
[36:45] certain way in there you know everything
[36:47] the utensils the showbread everything in
[36:50] that Temple had to be placed in order it
[36:53] had everything those candles had to be a
[36:55] certain place everything had to be lined
[36:57] up is that right man does anybody ever
[36:59] looked up the word Tabernacle you know
[37:02] Tabernacle is a feminist name it's not a
[37:04] masculine name you know who the
[37:06] Tabernacle is right right man sure
[37:08] everything in you's got to be lined up
[37:10] all right the showbread's got to be
[37:12] lined up everything Body Spirit and soul
[37:15] the conduct if it's not lined up
[37:17] somebody's gonna die that's right it's
[37:19] going to be you Mr Levi yep right does
[37:21] everybody understand that right so in
[37:23] that Tabernacle all three of them they
[37:25] had to have everything right right
[37:27] couldn't be out of order could it so the
[37:30] conduct the order and they had to hang
[37:32] with Moses does everybody understand
[37:33] that so their conduct their order in
[37:36] their Doctrine had to be so-so to Levi's
[37:37] right and if they ever got out of order
[37:39] they died God didn't play around with
[37:42] that right if I'm not playing around
[37:43] with you either he gave you a message
[37:46] that you better come you better come
[37:48] under that amen if you don't come under
[37:50] the message then you exalt yourself over
[37:51] it that's what Lucifer does he exalts
[37:54] itself over the message that's given in
[37:56] every hour is that right so you got to
[37:58] be careful if your bride your conduct's
[38:00] going to be according to the Levites
[38:02] right amen amen everything's going to be

[38:39] tread amen so see your life you've got
[38:42] to have a conduct in your life amen if
[38:44] if brother Brown said the Levites type
[38:46] the bride did I read it amen right I can
[38:48] show you two or three other places where
[38:49] he did it so the Levites typed the bride
[38:52] when they were down in Egypt I don't
[38:54] know if he understood about Levites I'm
[38:56] gonna tell you something some of you
[38:57] here may be that way somebody told me
[39:00] something tonight I want to I want you
[39:01] to listen to what I'm saying listen real
[39:04] close okay
[39:05] the Levites what happened was when when
[39:08] Joseph went in there he said they were
[39:10] sheep herders right or really had her
[39:13] they went down everybody lived in Goshen
[39:15] did you know that
[39:16] you know what happened the pharaoh who
[39:19] knew Joseph and was really nice to
[39:21] Joseph said we're going to build a city
[39:24] you know what he did he offered to pay
[39:25] him
[39:27] you didn't know that did you go back and
[39:29] look at your history
[39:30] the Pharaoh paid them for their services
[39:33] so they left Goshen
[39:36] after a job
[39:37] there's like no yeah if they were
[39:40] to stay down in Goshen everything would
[39:41] have been well with them they wouldn't
[39:43] have come into bondage does everybody
[39:44] understand that right so what happened
[39:46] to it because of a job
[39:48] they got out of Goshen they like the
[39:50] money yeah but after a while the money
[39:52] become a burden to them right after a
[39:55] pharaoh come in they didn't know Joseph
[39:56] he quit paying them right and then they
[39:59] were in bondage and they couldn't go
[40:00] back to Goshen right you know the only
[40:02] people that stayed in Goshen Levi yeah
[40:05] you know why Levi's stayed down in
[40:07] Goshen they wanted to pray and read
[40:08] their Bible every day right does that
[40:11] sound familiar from what I just talked
[40:12] to you all right so see the Levites they
[40:15] didn't want to get out of Goshen they
[40:17] were doing fine just living down there
[40:18] God was blessing them they were praying
[40:20] and reading their Bible they were able
[40:21] to read pictures but the rest of the 11
[40:24] tribes

[42:37] yeah really
[42:39] you mean you won't stay in the ocean
[42:40] yeah it becomes a bondage to them is
[42:43] what it is and they'll get under an old
[42:45] pharaoh who don't know Joseph
[42:47] yeah a preacher that don't know Jesus of
[42:49] Jesus is that right and you know what
[42:51] they do they come under bondage right
[42:53] that's what's happened to the people in
[42:55] that message of the hour that's right
[42:57] and they sell out is that right well the
[42:59] Levites didn't sell out right they
[43:01] stayed down in Goshen is where they did
[43:03] the others went up there and were mud
[43:05] daubers digging in that mud and you know
[43:07] what here we go in the wilderness
[43:09] Journey right Moses went up Moses come
[43:11] down the people were running naked
[43:13] around that calf can you imagine
[43:16] and and Moses said who's on the Lord's
[43:19] Side come and stand with me you know he
[43:20] stood with the Levites right the one had
[43:22] been praying reading their Bibles right
[43:24] these are the ones that stood see what
[43:26] he's talking about right brother Brown
[43:28] chased these types out through the Bible
[43:29] you know what I mean he really did he
[43:31] understood that Old Testament man those
[43:33] people stood with Moses is what they did
[43:35] is that right right they went through
[43:37] that they drew their swords and went
[43:38] through the car he killed all the sin
[43:39] out right now that's what it said go
[43:41] read it see if I'm not live or see if
[43:43] I'm not telling you the truth I'm not
[43:44] lying I'll tell you okay all right so we
[43:47] all understand that so we understand by
[43:49] Brother Branham and you go through and I
[43:51] can show you and I'm going to read some
[43:53] of them here in a minute and just
[43:54] comment on a little to show you that the
[43:57] Levites had a certain conduct that they
[43:59] did right and that conduct is showing
[44:01] you as a it's an example that's given
[44:03] instruction right so that you would know
[44:05] what your conduct's supposed to be is
[44:07] that right now it's the truth that's
[44:09] what you're if you want to know what
[44:11] your conduct should be go read about the
[44:13] Levites I'm going to challenge you to do
[44:15] that and when you do that say that's
[44:16] right because remember they were
[44:19] separated people they couldn't number
[44:21] them right the Levites couldn't own any
[44:24] property here right come on is that
[44:27] right exactly see there's nothing that I
[44:29] only hear right right I'm a levite I'm a
[44:32] bride there's nothing I own here
[44:34] this is just I'm just passing through
[44:37] it's not my home my treasures are laid
[44:39] up somewhere around the blue right so I
[44:42] believe I I have no possession here
[44:44] right is that right wasn't that the way
[44:46] they were all right man they had no
[44:48] possession on the earth so you go you're
[44:50] gonna fall in love with a job you ain't
[44:52] gonna Levi come on yeah you got no
[44:54] possession here you're just passing
[44:55] through what you're going to do is
[44:57] you're going to stay true you're going
[44:59] to read your Bible and pray every day
[45:00] live a simple Christian Life that's all
[45:03] it is just happy as they can be
[45:05] contentment was Godly that's a great
[45:07] name all right if people can't do that
[45:08] anymore they gotta they're gonna miss
[45:10] church on Sunday so they can go Bank 160
[45:13] bucks a month yeah
[45:15] I was floored by that yeah can I tell
[45:18] you something else it was a preacher
[45:21] preacher yeah
[45:24] yeah
[45:25] you know what you come up with all the
[45:27] time right exactly people you think are
[45:29] spiritual but they ain't got enough
[45:30] spiritual sense to know that for the man
[45:33] said you ought to if you got the Holy
[45:34] Ghost you can't wait till those doors
[45:36] open you want to be here every service I
[45:38] mean you wouldn't miss it for nothing
[45:39] right Birdman said one service can
[45:42] determine your final destination right
[45:44] yeah so those Levi's it was a serious
[45:46] thing to them right they didn't play is
[45:48] that right and so because they went out
[45:51] and killed in the camp you know what he
[45:53] said okay you leave out to Europe you
[45:55] know he said they were a chosen people
[45:56] right
[45:58] does that talk to Brian amen are we a
[46:00] chosen people all right go through the
[46:03] scripture and look at those Levites and
[46:04] you'll see everything that you are right
[46:06] you're a chosen people you were
[46:08] separated do you understand you didn't
[46:10] sell out the world what are the things
[46:12] of the world right and when you stood by
[46:14] Moses you stood by William Brown is that
[46:16] the type of a prophet is that the
[46:19] conduct we're supposed to have all right
[46:20] I'll tell you yes it's a conduct we're
[46:22] supposed to have is that right
[46:25] exactly but you know what they because
[46:28] that God said they're my chosen people
[46:30] right
[46:31] is that right they're my chosen people
[46:33] right that's what we are do you know
[46:36] what the Levites were supposed to do
[46:37] they were supposed to administer to air
[46:38] in the high priest yeah
[46:40] who's the high priest of your confession
[46:42] Jesus who are you supposed to administer
[46:45] to Jesus Christ then they say in the
[46:48] scripture Brothers ministering he said
[46:49] that's the bride there right see brother
[46:51] Branham when he said the Levites type to
[46:54] bride he wasn't just joking it wasn't
[46:55] something he just threw out there
[46:57] all the way through the scripture when
[46:59] you started going and chasing them out
[47:01] about to leave I looked up every quote
[47:03] on the money bites I wanted to see what
[47:04] he said about it and when you see it the
[47:06] fullness of the type of Levites is she
[47:08] that's the bride oh man that's the bride
[47:11] does everybody understand that man and
[47:13] I'm going to show you something here
[47:14] this is this is the way it uh
[47:17] you know nothing nothing that was
[47:20] unclean could come near that Ark of the
[47:22] Covenant right right exactly do you know
[47:24] who the guards were that
[47:25] the Levites you know what you're you're
[47:28] the guard of the word man you ain't
[47:30] gonna let no filthiness come to that
[47:32] word is that right this man last night
[47:36] told me that he felt like his job
[47:38] was to clean up the doctrine right and I
[47:42] believe that I believe that why he's a
[47:44] levite he ain't gonna let nobody not a
[47:46] preacher not a priest not a king he's
[47:49] going to come near that Army if their
[47:51] life is not conducive to what the word
[47:54] says is supposed to be that's right hey
[47:55] do you know if you look through pictures
[47:57] on the on the Tabernacle those Levites
[48:00] had a sword in their waistband
[48:03] they had a sword you know what that was
[48:05] for your son unbeliever tried to
[48:07] approach that they would whip their
[48:08] sword out and cut him to shreds if
[48:12] anybody tries to approach this message
[48:25] and it don't matter if it's my daughter
[48:27] it don't matter if it's my son right
[48:29] right it don't matter if it's my wife
[48:31] right it don't matter because why I'm a
[48:34] levite and I have been put in the
[48:36] position right to guard that to
[48:38] everybody amen is that right because God
[48:40] comes down there and sits on that amen
[48:42] you know what the turbine apple is your
[48:44] heart your heart all right right man
[48:45] that third compartment enters the
[48:47] Intervale is that what he said he said
[48:48] that curtain was your self-will right
[48:50] you're the one that lets him in right
[48:52] you're supposed to come bully Before the
[48:54] Throne you know I'm gonna protect what I
[48:57] got in my heart hey man that devil ain't
[48:59] gonna he ain't gonna approach me with
[49:00] something because when he does I'm gonna
[49:02] whip my sword out I'm gonna cut him to
[49:03] shreds he ain't gonna get near me
[49:05] brother and I carry that sword right
[49:07] here amen that's my part that's what I'm
[49:09] supposed to do as a Levi as a bride is
[49:12] that right that's right now come on
[49:14] that's what it is okay now let me show
[49:16] you something
[49:25] I think I had a board like this too by
[49:27] the way
[49:28] I bought it for you
[49:30] too yes I did I can't remember
[49:34] that's why I don't like it
[49:37] just joking
[49:40] does everybody understand this is the
[49:42] Tabernacle in the wilderness right
[49:44] that's right everybody understand that
[49:45] this is the big out here right I'm gonna
[49:48] have to draw it down so you can see it
[49:50] everybody understand that right
[49:52] here here
[49:54] where's the curtain here right right
[49:56] here's where the
[49:58] all right Mercy Seat was is that right
[50:00] here's where God came down here right
[50:03] now the Levites what they were in charge
[50:05] now the Levites they had a course the
[50:08] Levites were actually part of the 12
[50:09] tribes is that right in their course
[50:11] what they did that course that that
[50:14] group of Levites would run would be up
[50:16] here and they'd be serving in the temple
[50:17] yeah did everybody know that right right
[50:19] now I'm going to tell you something
[50:21] we're on the last course
[50:22] you are the last course of Levites
[50:25] there's no doubt in my mind yeah right
[50:28] I'm gonna be bold enough to make a
[50:29] statement tonight I believe we're the
[50:31] last course right I would believe we
[50:33] were the two or three on that back row
[50:35] were our conduct wasn't right right and
[50:37] we got to get it in order is everybody
[50:39] so the levite's job the Levites that
[50:44] when Moses laid down the doctrine they
[50:46] had to stand with Moses right the order
[50:49] everything had to be in order and he
[50:51] compartments do you agree with that I
[50:53] had to be perfect buddy every every jot
[50:55] and Tittle had to be right amen is that
[50:57] right so you have the right conda if
[51:00] you're a Levi you got the right conduct
[51:01] you got the right order you got the
[51:03] right doctor right amen no doubt about
[51:05] it is that right okay so here we are
[51:08] here's the Levi now the course that
[51:10] served and I could go read the
[51:11] scriptures I don't have much time I
[51:14] can't read the scriptures okay but go
[51:16] read them at home the Levites when they
[51:19] serve they actually this is where the
[51:21] Levites camped right here they were the
[51:22] group that camped here right right yep
[51:25] is that right right hey man sure right
[51:28] they did didn't they man now this is
[51:30] what happened here you had the tribes
[51:31] the 12 tribes right now the other Levi
[51:34] said it wasn't their course were down
[51:35] wherever their order was
[51:37] like well here's what you and I drew it
[51:39] way too big so I'm just going to show
[51:41] you something
[51:42] like this this is how they camped
[51:45] is everybody agree with that remember
[51:47] they were the close one I grew that way
[51:49] too big so visualize can you do that all
[51:52] right yeah okay here's what it was
[51:55] everybody okay with that hey man we're
[51:58] seeing it aren't you
[52:00] look this is the way it was
[52:03] and right here these bro these Levites
[52:06] ministered unto Aaron the high priest
[52:10] does everybody agree with that scripture
[52:12] says it okay now let me let me draw the
[52:15] picture truly the way it is can I do
[52:17] this man
[52:18] everybody's starting to see what it is
[52:20] amen yeah
[52:22] yeah
[52:23] everybody's starting to see what I'm
[52:25] drawing put it together connect the dots

[52:30] does everybody say what it is
[52:33] do you see what Moses singing in heaven
[52:35] right yeah
[52:37] you sing that pyramid is exactly what he
[52:40] said right what gave it away when I was
[52:42] reading Brethren said that now everybody
[52:44] understands the Levites were the only
[52:46] ones that were allowed to carry the ark
[52:47] right and the burden of it was on their
[52:49] heart exactly They Carried the ark over
[52:52] their heart everybody agree with that
[52:54] right he said that when they carried
[52:56] that you know that they really
[52:57] they were the Tabernacle down they put
[52:59] it up they put the showbread is that
[53:02] right right they were the ones that put
[53:04] everything in order right is that right

[53:07] herself ready amen all right they're the
[53:09] ones who put the Tabernacle on and the

[55:21] where we're going to be yes sir and we
[55:23] won't let nobody get there and we're
[55:25] doing it now
[55:27] spiritually speaking we're fulfilling
[55:29] the the order of the Levites now right
[55:32] right is that right amen right okay amen
[55:36] right so remember I believe I'd say they
[55:38] have a certain birth do we have to have
[55:40] a certain birth right you must be born
[55:42] again right is that right let me read
[55:45] some things that I looked up can I do
[55:47] that
[55:49] Levites were never numbered if you want
[55:51] to write it down numbers 147.
[55:53] the priests and Levites live the same
[55:55] life
[55:57] do you know the high priest
[55:59] he the rules of a high priest was the
[56:01] same rules that the Levites had sure now
[56:03] they were priests it was high priests
[56:05] and Priests right does it say in
[56:07] Revelation we're priests and Kings under
[56:08] God is that what it says your life can't
[56:11] be different than the high priest right
[56:13] and the high priest life can't be
[56:15] different yours it's the same life it's
[56:18] the same Holy Ghost amen is that right
[56:20] amen so does we understand pretty simple
[56:22] then
[56:26] Moses himself dispensed oracles and
[56:29] revealed the Divine will of God on men's
[56:32] guidance
[56:34] is that right sure Moses gave the
[56:37] oracles that's right he did the Levites
[56:39] went and did it yeah you know what we're
[56:41] supposed to do that's what I said
[56:43] earlier see you're a Levi because why
[56:45] you go do it right if you don't do it
[56:47] how can you be a Levi your conduct or
[56:49] you'll die at in that right if another
[56:52] Levi was to try to approach that
[56:54] with the wrong conduct order Doctrine
[56:56] he'd have been killed right remember
[56:58] when those Levites come and stood with
[57:00] Moses is that right later on some of
[57:03] them Levites decided Moses had too much
[57:05] on him oh yeah were they Levites
[57:08] did they die right why their conduct
[57:10] order and Doctrine waiting right they
[57:13] said they stood with Moses but then they
[57:15] got out there it out and out there and
[57:18] decided you know what Moses ain't the
[57:20] only one around here it's right God
[57:22] talks to us too isn't that what they
[57:25] said
[57:26] that's what suddenly got in some of
[57:28] these message preachers brother gave us
[57:30] the perfect conduct ordering Doctrine
[57:33] right and all we got to do is go do it
[57:35] get our conduct order Doctrine right and
[57:39] you understand it's done deal
[57:41] but what do they do they're going to add
[57:44] their own order to it yeah they gotta
[57:46] add their own conduct to it yeah right I
[57:48] mean I know it's settlement they might
[57:49] be here in Georgia I don't know where
[57:50] somebody stand in the back row handing
[57:52] the women hoes when they come in
[57:54] are you kidding where do you see that in
[57:56] a message do you see that anywhere yeah
[57:58] no you better stand by Moses Mr preacher
[58:00] you better quit hatching up all this
[58:02] crazy stuff you understand what I'm
[58:04] saying and I told him what I feel like
[58:06] my call in life is to do is to stay true

[1:00:30] it says because and I had a preacher
[1:00:32] tell me this one time it blew away the
[1:00:34] statement but it's a true statement you

[1:00:38] age of maturity that you're God to him
[1:00:40] sure
[1:00:41] that's a tough statement isn't it right

[1:01:07] I'm not always I'm not saying that
[1:01:09] always does everybody understand that
[1:01:10] but sometimes it could be the life that
[1:01:13] you live is why your kids are walking
[1:01:15] the way they're walking but the Levites
[1:01:17] lived in the exemplary life right so if
[1:01:19] you're the bride you're going to live

[1:01:47] sacrifice to God and don't want to get

[1:01:51] right that's a levite because they
[1:01:52] brought their sacrifices to glory is
[1:01:54] that right you see the times through it
[1:01:56] yes sir lives were blameless
[1:02:00] when a priest sinned he brought guilt
[1:02:03] upon himself in the family
[1:02:04] right
[1:02:06] right it's purely by when you see it you
[1:02:09] bring guilt
[1:02:11] upon himself and the family right they
[1:02:15] were judges did you know that right
[1:02:18] absolutely amen are we going to be
[1:02:20] judges on the other side yeah right

[1:02:27] did you know that
[1:02:29] do you know and I'm going to tell you a
[1:02:30] quote and it Thrills me do you know on
[1:02:33] the other side when we're in this
[1:02:35] setting here
[1:02:36] that the people out there who grow
[1:02:38] gardens plant potatoes we're not going
[1:02:40] to be doing that right the Levites
[1:02:42] didn't work right right does everybody
[1:02:44] hear me right the Levites didn't work
[1:02:47] got it that's right I'm not gonna what
[1:02:49] was what was the curse that put on Adam
[1:02:51] you're going to work by the sweat of
[1:02:52] your foot work w-o-ook that's a
[1:02:54] four-letter word to a lot of people
[1:02:55] right work I need to work over there
[1:02:58] right I'm not gonna be under that
[1:03:01] Covenant you understand yeah I'm not
[1:03:03] going to work but the people outside
[1:03:04] there are going too they're going to be
[1:03:06] planting potatoes and they're gonna be
[1:03:08] playing Tomatoes all those things and
[1:03:10] you know what they're going to bring

[1:03:20] that they grew out there right you ain't
[1:03:21] gonna work but they're going to tie to
[1:03:23] you well that's why you tie the Levi's
[1:03:25] right so in time you're going to live in
[1:03:28] that City and I'm going to quote I can
[1:03:30] prove it you know you've read it but he
[1:03:32] they bring their ties in they bring
[1:03:34] their tithes in then they get the leaves
[1:03:36] off the tree for the nation exactly so
[1:03:39] these keys of the Earth are going to
[1:03:40] bring their tithing into the city right
[1:03:41] and that's what we're gonna live off
[1:03:43] from
[1:03:44] we're gonna eat the tomatoes they grew
[1:03:46] right the potatoes they Rude the lettuce
[1:03:48] the apples whatever you have an appetite
[1:03:50] for all right you understand that's what
[1:03:52] you're going to do you're the Levites
[1:03:54] you're the bride is that right I mean
[1:03:57] it's perfect brother I could read that
[1:03:59] quote to you but I got 24 pages of
[1:04:01] clothes I'm afraid if I get started
[1:04:03] reading quotes we won't get out of here
[1:04:04] you know
[1:04:07] he ministered to the high priest I
[1:04:08] already said that right
[1:04:10] he partook of the show bread
[1:04:12] took care of the furniture vessels and
[1:04:14] curtains so he put everything in order
[1:04:16] in here right there was an order to this
[1:04:18] right go kid yourself there was a real
[1:04:20] real word or two right okay
[1:04:24] inspected unclean persons
[1:04:27] come on
[1:04:29] man don't tell me you don't know when
[1:04:30] somebody on clean trash to approached
[1:04:32] this right that's right why you got the
[1:04:33] message right you've got what William
[1:04:35] Brown said right a woman coming here
[1:04:37] with Bob here and say she's got the Holy
[1:04:39] Ghost are you going to be fooled by that
[1:04:40] if she jumped up spoke in tongues you're
[1:04:42] going to say oh we had a sister to smoke

[1:04:46] brother Terence is gonna go there and
[1:04:48] said sister we had an order here right
[1:04:50] now and that is subject to this man in
[1:04:53] the Pulpit don't interrupt daddy right
[1:04:55] that's what you say right there right
[1:04:57] amen yeah is that right sure so so what
[1:05:01] we can expect seeing do you know the
[1:05:03] Levites in the Old Testament when
[1:05:04] somebody had leprosy if they had leprosy
[1:05:07] they could go they had to go to their
[1:05:09] house and inspect to see if it's clean
[1:05:10] of leprosy right yeah you know what
[1:05:12] leprosy is a type of yeah
[1:05:15] so when somebody comes into the camp you
[1:05:18] got every right to say
[1:05:20] sister you need to quit bobbing your
[1:05:22] hair but don't love sisters I've watched
[1:05:24] some scissors they'll blow you away you

[1:05:28] they get through see you you know it's
[1:05:30] like I told them you know really I
[1:05:32] wouldn't have to preach on the hair and
[1:05:34] all that if a sister come in we let her
[1:05:36] say a few Services right we got love oh
[1:05:38] yeah don't we a little compassion but
[1:05:41] after a while you say sister you know
[1:05:42] our women don't wear see-through blouses
[1:05:45] yeah
[1:05:46] right we believe that a woman ought to
[1:05:48] be you know
[1:05:51] you know you you would you do that would
[1:05:54] you do that sister or brother Sable
[1:05:55] could preach the great things right but
[1:05:58] see it ain't just up to him the fact
[1:05:59] that you're a levite you could correct
[1:06:02] the situation be careful you know you
[1:06:04] give some people Authority you know
[1:06:05] they'll play you think you got run over
[1:06:07] by a D9 right right I mean because they
[1:06:09] don't like the way you comb your hair
[1:06:11] no come on you know
[1:06:14] willing to risk their lives in service
[1:06:17] for the Lord amen you know brother
[1:06:19] random said when you do service for the
[1:06:20] Lord it'll never be forgotten right do
[1:06:22] you know every service that you every
[1:06:24] service You Preach there's a reward for
[1:06:26] you sure did you know that every time
[1:06:28] you open your Bible and you're in
[1:06:30] service for the Lord another man said
[1:06:31] that does not go unnoticed all right
[1:06:33] amen there is a reward coming for you
[1:06:35] for that did you know that
[1:06:38] that's what it was
[1:06:42] they were the temple musicians
[1:06:44] the Levites did you know that
[1:06:46] right right sure
[1:06:52] they were to inspire and spiritually
[1:06:54] prepare Israel for war
[1:06:56] did you know that yeah weren't they
[1:06:59] that's right yeah
[1:07:01] you know that in every levite there's a
[1:07:04] special chromosome that none of the
[1:07:05] other tribes have right exactly that's
[1:07:06] right you know that I know I knew you
[1:07:09] knew that right they have a y chromosome
[1:07:11] that nobody else has right there's
[1:07:13] something in you that's different than
[1:07:14] the rest all right that's right is that
[1:07:17] right so you as a Levi there's something
[1:07:20] in you right that's different than the
[1:07:22] rest but there's something in you bride
[1:07:25] that's different than the rest is that
[1:07:27] right right there so you go I challenge
[1:07:30] you when you go I ask my church you know
[1:07:33] what people do they'll a preacher
[1:07:34] they'll hear oh he's a good message they
[1:07:36] go home they don't open up and check it
[1:07:37] out right see what I want you to do I
[1:07:39] want you to go from here and I want you
[1:07:40] to read it I'm just telling you a few
[1:07:42] things that I thought about the Levites
[1:07:44] go in your Old Testament and read about
[1:07:46] the Levites and you'll see it over and
[1:07:49] over and over again how those Levites
[1:07:52] type the bride is that right
[1:07:55] that's what the true type of Levites are
[1:07:57] is the bride right that's what brother
[1:07:59] Bram said in COD I never knew that until
[1:08:01] I read that quote and I stopped it took
[1:08:03] my breath I said what
[1:08:05] and I looked at the book name conduct
[1:08:07] ordered a doctor and I said sure he's by
[1:08:10] the Levites he's set in a shadow in the
[1:08:12] Old Testament to show you how you're
[1:08:14] supposed to conduct your life right the
[1:08:16] most perfect shadow of how we're
[1:08:18] supposed to live is by the way the
[1:08:20] Levites in the Bible right and we had a
[1:08:22] prophet to come down here and break it
[1:08:24] down into Kentucky's
[1:08:26] or we'd have never seen it does
[1:08:28] everybody and we're supposed to as
[1:08:30] ministers we're supposed to break it
[1:08:31] down for the people right to let them
[1:08:34] know how they can approach God right
[1:08:35] because why the only way you can
[1:08:37] approach God is if you're conduct your
[1:08:39] order right now your Doctrine is correct
[1:08:42] right exactly if it's not you'll die
[1:08:44] right does everybody understand that
[1:08:46] yeah amen all right pretty simple isn't
[1:08:49] it yeah amen pretty simple
[1:08:55] hold on just a minute okay
[1:08:57] I'm at Good Times
[1:09:02] let's just stop there can we stop there
[1:09:04] everybody got one point
[1:09:16] there are
[1:09:18] there's just so many here that I can
[1:09:20] tell you about it and I just read some
[1:09:22] of them this is my notes I preached four
[1:09:24] sermons on this fat phone yeah I just I
[1:09:27] just couldn't believe how you know I
[1:09:29] could believe it brother Adam said it
[1:09:30] right but it was never open to me right
[1:09:32] until I read it all right so go back get
[1:09:36] your bike that's right remember if
[1:09:37] you're a Levi
[1:09:39] they stayed down the ocean they read
[1:09:40] their Bibles every day they love the
[1:09:43] word of God they were just the thing
[1:09:45] that made them the most content was just
[1:09:47] study in the word yeah yeah you didn't
[1:09:49] care about going out and making big
[1:09:51] money you know at the job side oh man
[1:09:54] you know Pharaoh's paying
[1:09:56] a lot of money down there didn't face
[1:09:58] the Levites at all
[1:10:00] they were happy being in Church Reading
[1:10:03] their Bibles studying the scriptures why
[1:10:06] can't we do that why don't why are we
[1:10:08] always so stiff-necked and uncircumcised
[1:10:11] do always resist the Holy Ghost is that
[1:10:14] right why do we do that you know brother
[1:10:17] Brandon said if you've got a complex do
[1:10:18] the opposite I heard that young man I
[1:10:21] don't know who you are done you know but
[1:10:22] anyway I preached the other day on
[1:10:24] Abominations you know God hates lying
[1:10:26] right oh he hates lying sure I told him
[1:10:30] if you look at it it said lying lies you
[1:10:33] know some people just lie to like yeah
[1:10:34] my little granddaughter she's eight
[1:10:36] years old that girl really lied to me
[1:10:38] didn't tell me the truth lying just to
[1:10:40] be lying and the scripture talks about
[1:10:42] that is that right and got another line
[1:10:45] you bear false witness against the
[1:10:47] brother God really hates that right but
[1:10:49] nonetheless God hates it right he hates
[1:10:51] it so much
[1:10:53] in the Book of Revelation he said if you
[1:10:55] add to and take away your part will be
[1:10:57] taken out right exactly like I told
[1:10:58] somebody if you ever when I when I took
[1:11:00] psychology class in college they told
[1:11:02] whispered something a girl's ear the
[1:11:04] professor and then she he said now you
[1:11:06] tell you it's like one person out of
[1:11:08] class at us for the same thing in their
[1:11:09] ear they did it for 10 people then the
[1:11:12] 10th person the professor pulled her out
[1:11:13] said now repeat what they said
[1:11:15] and they repeated what was said he held
[1:11:18] up what he told them it wasn't even
[1:11:19] close all right you understand that
[1:11:21] that's why you people add to and take
[1:11:24] away right now if you're doing that in
[1:11:26] the natural God already told us we're
[1:11:28] not supposed to add or take away from
[1:11:30] Revelation right I told him you know God
[1:11:32] protected that but you know that's where
[1:11:34] it tells the Harley who she is yeah it
[1:11:36] exposes the Roman Catholic you know they
[1:11:38] changed the Bible they won't change that
[1:11:40] one right you know why because God put
[1:11:41] it if you change if you add to or change
[1:11:44] this one
[1:11:50] God's a real smart guy yeah they
[1:11:53] protected that word in Revelation right
[1:11:55] because there's going to be a bride down
[1:11:56] here at the end time he's going to catch
[1:11:58] it and he said you know what I'm going
[1:12:00] to protect that but see God hates
[1:12:03] attitude and take it away right so if
[1:12:05] you do that you know that's a lie and
[1:12:06] God hates that right
[1:12:08] right I told my daughter in the truck I
[1:12:10] picked her up at school and she said so
[1:12:12] I said Chloe do you know God hates a
[1:12:15] liar she got real quiet I said do you
[1:12:17] know scripture says that the devil is
[1:12:20] the father of liars I said if you
[1:12:22] continue doing that girl do you realize
[1:12:24] the devil's your daddy
[1:12:26] I don't know if it did good or not but I
[1:12:28] told her all right I mean little
[1:12:30] eight-year-old girl but I told her
[1:12:32] God hates lies and for that you young
[1:12:34] man whoever you were
[1:12:36] I Pat you on the back for getting up and
[1:12:39] apologizing because your conduct was not
[1:12:42] conducive to this church
[1:12:45] I commend him for it no chance there's a
[1:12:48] lot of people been in this message 40
[1:12:49] years ago right you got that right
[1:12:51] that's the church we're giving for
[1:12:52] nonsense is that right
[1:12:54] so God will bless you
[1:12:56] and anytime let me tell you something
[1:12:58] brother man says you've got a complex do
[1:13:00] the opposite next time the Devil comes
[1:13:02] to you and wants you to lie tell the
[1:13:03] truth yeah right scripture says to
[1:13:05] resist the devil he'll flee from you
[1:13:07] whatever the devil's trying to give you
[1:13:09] do the opposite right and that's
[1:13:12] resisting brother man said that's
[1:13:13] resistant exactly you should do the
[1:13:15] opposite right so when the Devil comes
[1:13:17] to you and tries to tip you with
[1:13:18] something do the opposite and he said
[1:13:21] resist the devil he'll flee from right
[1:13:23] amen is that right so all we got to do
[1:13:25] is do the opposite amen that's why we
[1:13:28] know the conduct the order and the
[1:13:30] doctor to this right yeah exactly right
[1:13:32] and we're the bride we're the Levites
[1:13:34] that's going to keep it right is that
[1:13:35] right thank you Lord right I'm gonna let
