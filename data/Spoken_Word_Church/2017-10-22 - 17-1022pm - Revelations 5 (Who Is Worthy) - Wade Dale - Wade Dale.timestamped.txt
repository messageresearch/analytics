[10:34] good to be in the house of the Lord let
[10:36] me read you a little something that we
[10:37] got in the email it tells you how far
[10:40] reaching that that the ministry is here
[10:42] and and that people are being blessed
[10:46] around the world this comes from a
[10:48] brother in Western Australia says dear
[10:52] brother Samuel I have been listening to
[10:54] your sermons for some time now so I just
[10:56] wanted to write and say how much I
[10:57] appreciate your ministry most pastors
[11:00] preach encouraging sermons but I find
[11:02] that your depth of understanding of the
[11:04] message and your teaching has greatly
[11:05] helped me I've been following the
[11:07] message for many years and I am now an
[11:09] old man living alone in a retirement
[11:11] village in Perth Western Australia it is
[11:15] not easy for me to go to church so
[11:17] listening to your sermons and also
[11:18] brother Wade's is a wonderful blessing I
[11:20] will never meet you on this side but
[11:23] you've touched my life and I just want
[11:26] to say thank you God bless you yours in
[11:28] Christ brother Kenneth gone from
[11:32] Australia so
[11:36] there'll be a lot of people when we all
[11:40] get together over there there'll be a
[11:42] lot of people said we really enjoyed
[11:45] what you had to say and you never meet
[11:48] them in your entire life same way on
[11:50] your walk in life it's not just here
[11:52] folks this ice you you're walking life
[11:56] your job and and many things that you do
[11:59] you you affect people the reason we're
[12:04] here is for our purpose and it's not
[12:07] just to have our own little caulk and
[12:11] you know ever knowwwww supposed to give
[12:13] it to the world you supposed to let your
[12:15] light shine everywhere you go so good to
[12:17] be in the house of lore but yeah I
[12:18] thought that was kind of good I mean way
[12:19] over in Australia only Donnie's been to
[12:21] Australia I mean it's a long way from
[12:23] here but but thank goodness this brother
[12:26] at the end of his life coming into a
[12:29] retirement village and can't get out hey
[12:31] ain't nothing wrong with that listening
[12:34] to the Word of God and getting something
[12:35] any blessing their soul there's a lot of
[12:37] things we listen to bless our soul but
[12:40] but coming from a true believer I
[12:43] believe it's it's worthy so let's turn
[12:46] to Revelation chapter 5 we'll get
[12:47] started now on Revelation chapter 5 and
[12:49] today we want to talk about who is
[12:51] worthy because we see we come up and I'm
[12:56] going to take the chart one more time
[13:00] and just kind of give us some an update
[13:02] of of where we're at in the message as
[13:06] far as coming out of the church ages
[13:09] because remember the message the message
[13:13] is eternal so and you do have to place
[13:17] it in different in different spots but
[13:20] you got to remember that Jesus Christ
[13:21] was slain 2,000 years ago but he was a
[13:23] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[13:25] world that in God's mind that all this
[13:27] is finished but we had to come down here
[13:28] into reality and go through it right and
[13:31] I was like I was thinking the other day
[13:34] you know brother Dale was talking about
[13:36] we would really we would just be we'd be
[13:40] almost zombies because a zombie has
[13:42] nothing inside of them we'd we were
[13:44] really when we were if we just came
[13:46] there the plan that we thought
[13:50] we would be nothing more than just we'd
[13:51] say yes sir and we would be robots and
[13:54] there would be no Bible there would be
[13:56] no overcoming there would be no
[13:57] redemption there would be no revelation
[14:00] there would not be anything it would
[14:02] just be a void there that we would fill
[14:04] and I don't think God God's not that way
[14:06] so he didn't want us to be that way and
[14:08] then so the full revelation of God is
[14:10] this is the way God knew that we would
[14:14] love him the most is to put it in this
[14:16] way right here if not he would have
[14:19] changed then he changed his mind his
[14:22] original plan was this and we're living
[14:26] it I told you many times before and
[14:31] you'll get this one day is this what God
[14:34] thought of or is this his fault cause if
[14:38] he thought of something then it went
[14:39] maybe thirty Seconds to go because
[14:41] remember God's not even in one second
[14:43] he's not one second older than when he
[14:45] thought it before the foundation of the
[14:47] world amen so is this the thought of God
[14:49] back then and then now we've come to
[14:51] time travel or is this the thought of
[14:53] God just being made known just rolling
[14:57] through we drop down I was thinking
[14:59] about this morning we drop down into
[15:01] time that thread of eternity never move
[15:03] you can't move eternal but you can move
[15:07] us we come down in the time but we're
[15:10] going and then that eternal we just
[15:12] connect right back to it and take off
[15:13] again so so good to be in the house of
[15:16] the Lord we're gonna start here
[15:17] revelations 5 and we're we're like we
[15:19] said in the chart we're we're in between
[15:20] that we're in the breach all right so we
[15:23] got to get this thing right the first
[15:25] time and I think that's what brother
[15:27] Branham was he brought that breach at
[15:29] the correct moment to bring us to the
[15:32] and I when you say real revelation that
[15:34] didn't mean that they got a wrong
[15:36] revelation it's just that their
[15:37] revelation was partial I mean all the
[15:40] church ages revelation was partial but
[15:43] I'm promising you Martin Luther even in
[15:45] his partial that little drinking beer
[15:48] and smoking the pipe and and talking
[15:50] about the Word of God that was for his
[15:53] time but if he was to sit here today and
[15:56] listen to a few sermons all that would
[15:59] go away
[16:00] and he wouldn't understand and you know
[16:02] he would probably run anyhow where we
[16:04] fall asleep because hit what it would
[16:09] quickened the part that he didn't have
[16:12] it would quicken that part and he would
[16:14] come right over and just say well that's
[16:16] what that said that's what that said
[16:18] that's what that said but that's the way
[16:20] you and I gotta be though cuz we got to
[16:22] move up we got to remember the thoughts
[16:24] of God is he turning we entered the
[16:26] thoughts of God then we've got to come
[16:28] into that eternal thought we'll see that
[16:30] in just a little while but remember
[16:32] before we read the scripture next
[16:35] Saturday will be the it's not in no
[16:39] Decemberists its next Saturday Saturday
[16:42] we're going to have our Fall Festival
[16:44] we've got it kind of all set up for the
[16:45] kids and the grown-ups we're not gonna
[16:48] have a dunking booth so don't worry
[16:50] about it I just thought I'd scare you
[16:51] but we're gonna have one in April
[16:52] because it'll be warm then not afraid
[16:54] we'd all get sick if we had one this
[16:56] this weekend so we won't have that but
[16:59] we will have hot dogs and chili can't do
[17:04] anything without chili and it's gonna be
[17:06] chilly so bring jackets we're gonna have
[17:08] a little fire but just make sure you
[17:10] bring your jackets with you and also
[17:12] remember the next Saturday November the
[17:15] 4th I'll be at brother Tim hems at 7
[17:17] o'clock on Saturday evening to have
[17:20] service there and then we're gonna stay
[17:21] over and being serviced with them on
[17:23] Sunday so just keep us in your prayers
[17:25] and know some of you were gonna go then
[17:27] the next Saturday November the 11th is
[17:30] Jim's mother's memorial service at
[17:32] Center Baptist Church she has the
[17:35] obituaries you can run your copy off
[17:37] from there or if you have the Atlanta
[17:39] journal-constitution you can just get it
[17:40] out of it but her obit is in the in the
[17:43] AJC today so you can get that and it is
[17:47] at Center Baptist Church and I think
[17:49] technically it's Roberts town I think it
[17:51] says Helen but I think it's Roberts
[17:52] towns where you'll put your address in
[17:54] so just keep those in your prayer as we
[17:56] follow through so let's go to the Lord
[17:59] and pray Heavenly Father we pray Lord
[18:01] that you just be with us today father
[18:03] you be the one who does the speaking let
[18:07] us hear from you today Lord as as we
[18:10] look through and see these eternal words
[18:12] that are written on the page
[18:14] or may they come alive in our heart may
[18:17] each one of us realized what we're doing
[18:18] here where we come from what we're doing
[18:22] here and where we're going
[18:23] Lord that way we know that you're our
[18:25] guide and you're the one that's going to
[18:27] take us to that position we're looking
[18:30] forward to the many days ahead Lord
[18:32] until your coming that we will grow more
[18:35] in you that the that the bride of Jesus
[18:37] Christ will be as you said in
[18:39] revelations 19 will be a a wife not just
[18:42] a bride will be a wife because we've
[18:44] made ourselves ready we pray Lord that
[18:46] you distinct to find Lord for this
[18:47] journey be with the ones that are not
[18:49] here the ones are on the highways be
[18:51] with the missionaries father give them
[18:52] Lord give them bountiful fruit for their
[18:55] labor Lord we pray that you just take
[18:57] care of us here in this building be with
[18:59] us now and the further man their service
[19:00] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[19:03] revelations five who is worthy and I saw
[19:07] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[19:08] throne a book written within and on the
[19:10] backside sealed with seven seals and I
[19:12] saw a strong angel proclaiming with her
[19:14] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[19:16] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[19:19] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[19:21] under the earth and I was looking for a
[19:22] man no man in heaven nor an earth
[19:25] neither under the earth was able to open
[19:26] the book neither to look thereon and I
[19:30] wept much because no man was found
[19:31] worthy to open and to read the book
[19:33] neither to look thereon and one of the
[19:35] elders said unto me weep not behold the
[19:38] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[19:40] David have prevailed to open the book
[19:41] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[19:45] I'll be held in law in the midst of the
[19:46] throne and of the four beasts now who
[19:48] are the four beasts lion ox man and
[19:49] Eagle that's the Holy Ghost amen and in
[19:53] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[19:55] it had been slain having seven horns and
[19:57] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[19:59] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[20:02] he came and took the book out of the
[20:03] right hand of him that sat upon the
[20:05] throne and when he had taken the book
[20:06] the four beasts and four and twenty
[20:08] elders fell down before the lamb having
[20:10] every one of them harps go and golden
[20:12] vials full of odours which are the
[20:14] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[20:16] song saying thou art worthy to take the
[20:17] book and to open the seals thereof for
[20:19] thou was slain and have two redeemed us
[20:22] till they made it personal to God by the
[20:24] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[20:26] and people and nation and we
[20:27] finally get to this maybe later on in a
[20:29] few sermons and has made us unto our God
[20:33] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[20:37] this earth now if you look in your
[20:40] Scofield Bible the original says we
[20:43] shall reign over the earth a man you may
[20:46] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[20:48] the reading the word you shall what
[20:51] reign over the earth because remember
[20:55] sorry I ain't got Thomas you remain over
[20:59] the aren't you and I are go to what if
[21:02] Adam I'm way down here I can't stand how
[21:08] much shoes not tied and I usually double
[21:11] knot him but not today but remember I
[21:19] was looking the other day we were
[21:22] talking about something and then the
[21:24] word overcome now we're gonna talk about
[21:27] who is worthy but now remember the
[21:29] reason he was worthy is he overcame
[21:33] something a man think about he overcame
[21:37] something who did Christ remember he got
[21:41] an inheritance remember will read it in
[21:45] a couple of Sundays from now he got an
[21:47] inheritance he inherited eternal wife in
[21:51] his body right he didn't have he didn't
[21:55] need eternal life in his soul My heavens
[21:57] he was he turn alive he didn't just have
[21:59] it he was it a man it's not that Christ
[22:03] is like Bob was telling us in Sunday
[22:06] school this morning you know that that
[22:08] baby that was in that cradle that was
[22:12] gone all mighty no more no less but he
[22:19] was God Almighty in human flesh given
[22:23] what the ability to breathe air down
[22:26] here and to live on earth and become
[22:28] what our kinsmen and that's what we're
[22:30] going to talk about today is who is
[22:32] worthy because whoever's worthy had to
[22:35] be if we fail that made us what unworthy
[22:39] we are on
[22:41] worthy but now we got to remember that
[22:45] little brother how you doing come on in
[22:49] sit down brother Raphael is with us
[22:53] today
[22:53] good to see you buddy all right so now
[22:59] we're this is where we're at for our
[23:02] study everybody knows what that is the
[23:08] candlesticks we're here this is the
[23:11] breach where the Prophet talks about
[23:17] revelations 5 we okay with that say man
[23:21] all right because we know this is what
[23:23] revelation 6 now also you got to
[23:26] remember revelations fathers the
[23:28] breaking of the seals right show you
[23:30] what you're doing is you're gonna lap
[23:31] back and what is this this is telling us
[23:33] that it's broke he was worthy to open
[23:36] the book this is telling us how it
[23:39] happened got it all right this is
[23:42] telling us how it happened in revelation
[23:44] 6 called you're gonna have to lap back
[23:46] and forth because revelations 5 is a
[23:48] scene that John was what he saw the
[23:51] church ages and man revelations 1
[23:54] through 3 he was caught up in 4:1 now
[23:57] you got to remember to an eye I wanted
[23:59] to hit on this but I kind of kind of
[24:01] didn't because the prophet of God said
[24:03] revelation 4:1 the bride goes up and
[24:06] she's not seen until revelations 19 is
[24:09] everybody alright with that we should be
[24:10] taught well enough to know that this is
[24:13] all scenes that happen and it has all
[24:16] for Israel we're not physically you got
[24:21] it physically here you said what about
[24:23] the coating of the seal I thought we had
[24:25] to be in a higher realm where what we
[24:29] are eternal creatures now that we're
[24:31] born again we're eternal creatures
[24:32] trapped in time and then we're trapped
[24:35] in time but this right here because
[24:37] remember time is no longer when we get
[24:39] to revelations 10 we come to that place
[24:41] where there's no time but we're getting
[24:44] ahead of ourselves so let's drop back to
[24:45] revelations chapter 5 and I saw in the
[24:48] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[24:49] book written within on the backside
[24:52] sealed with seven seals now as we've
[24:54] told you before
[24:55] and for those of you that weren't here
[24:56] that we understand one thing's for sure
[25:00] that the Old Testament Bible and the
[25:03] scrolls were written not in a book but
[25:05] it was written like this if you wanted
[25:09] to read Isaiah the prophet of God said
[25:10] you had to what unroll that part of I
[25:12] left alright so now so then then
[25:16] obviously this is not the seal the seal
[25:20] is what had it hid the seal is what had
[25:23] it closed where you couldn't see what
[25:25] was inside all right so the revelation
[25:28] of the seals broke the seal off and then
[25:33] and then you could read what was inside
[25:35] that all rights Amen all right that's
[25:38] exactly what we're looking at too though
[25:40] even in Revelations 5 we see that
[25:43] somebody was worthy to take this and
[25:47] pull the seal back because no man was
[25:51] worthy to do it william branham was not
[25:53] worthy to do it
[25:55] john the baptist was not worthy to do it
[25:58] paul was not worthy to do it yet they're
[26:01] a part of it you can't kick them out
[26:04] they're a part of it because they broke
[26:07] while the Prophet was here through the
[26:10] Prophet Christ broke the seals and then
[26:14] cause remember as we as we showed you
[26:16] before and I'm getting a little ahead of
[26:18] myself but I think I want to all right
[26:20] so look you got in the Old Testament you
[26:22] got seven church ages right we talked
[26:25] about that the other day but for those
[26:27] of you that weren't here there's seven
[26:28] church ages in the Old Testament brother
[26:31] Branham said the middle age is just like
[26:33] our middle age was when what church and
[26:36] state combined church and state combined
[26:39] when they having Jezebel married so you
[26:42] kind of got your center point but we
[26:44] know one thing for sure the last church
[26:46] age of the Old Testament Elijah came on
[26:49] the scene John the Baptist because in
[26:54] the last church age of the Gentiles who
[26:56] came on the scene the Elijah William
[26:59] Branham the messenger comes at the end
[27:01] of the age John came at the end of the
[27:04] age what six months the prophet of God
[27:07] said walk the Laodicean age would be a
[27:09] a short age so John had a short age but
[27:12] now who did he introduce he introduced
[27:16] the head Christ the literal man I mean
[27:22] the flesh man John introduced the flesh
[27:24] man Christ the Son of man on the earth
[27:28] behold the lamb of God it takes away the
[27:30] sin of the Orcas into the world
[27:31] now what this allowed you do same thing
[27:36] but now what happened between here and
[27:39] here
[27:40] Christ II more feed from what of
[27:43] corporal body come on somebody he come
[27:47] he more and more feed from a corporal
[27:49] body because that corporal body went up
[27:51] cuz we're gonna talk about Thrones here
[27:53] in a minute that corporal body went up
[27:56] and it's sitting but what to do he sent
[27:57] the Holy Ghost down to m-more feet into
[28:01] a bride he morphing into a bride sure he
[28:07] had bride all these church ages is his
[28:09] body we know that but right at the end
[28:12] the head had to come that's what we're
[28:16] looking to revelations file because when
[28:19] we get to the end of this service I want
[28:21] you to see that he says who is worthy
[28:23] and what's the first thing you think of
[28:25] Christ Jesus Christ not Christ Jesus
[28:29] Christ amen
[28:31] cuz it was a man sure Christ is a man
[28:34] but Christ is all the way back from the
[28:37] beginning but he wasn't a flesh man
[28:42] kinsman redeemer man until he came right
[28:47] here amen
[28:48] at the end of the church age of the Old
[28:51] Testament that's why I remember the teto
[28:54] the New Testament didn't start till the
[28:56] book of I Matthew Mark Luke and John is
[28:59] a commentary of what happened while the
[29:01] Son of Man was here but you come at the
[29:03] end John come at the end of that age I
[29:06] love this and introduced Christ and
[29:09] Christ preached three and a half years
[29:13] Elijah in the end time introduced Christ
[29:20] in the breach introduced class and then
[29:23] he preached for three and a half years
[29:25] brought the headstone back to the church
[29:28] not back to the person Christ I said the
[29:32] person Jesus Christ we will not see him
[29:36] until the Millenium in the way that we
[29:39] want to see it
[29:40] is that right remember we meet him in
[29:43] the air sure we go to a wedding supper
[29:45] we go eat and we have a rejoicing time
[29:48] but I want you to see something when he
[29:52] said in Revelations who will read it in
[29:54] a minute he said you'll sit in my throat
[29:57] as I have set in my father stroke you're
[30:00] gonna sit in my throne now the Father's
[30:03] throne is in heaven the son of man's
[30:06] throne is on this earth this is when we
[30:10] set our foot back on this earth in the
[30:12] Millennium will God Almighty in human
[30:18] flesh he'll be the son of David that's
[30:21] one we're gonna see in a few minutes the
[30:23] reason he's worthy we know that he was
[30:26] virgin born son of God we know that but
[30:28] he had to go through stages because
[30:29] remember he was the son of God
[30:31] - the son of man - the son of David Amen
[30:34] because there's promises in the Bible
[30:36] for each one of them alright where do
[30:40] you say sterling a man well Moses said
[30:42] what he'll they'll raise up a prophet
[30:44] locking to me right so we had all the
[30:48] promises then David David said Michael
[30:51] the your throne will be forever son of
[30:55] David gonna be wise there's the
[30:57] Millennium alright so let's just start
[31:00] here and see because in Revelations 5
[31:03] look I'm not saying these people in the
[31:07] church ages weren't worthy they were
[31:09] worthy for their part but there's only
[31:12] one man that was ever worthy and that's
[31:15] Christ Jesus not Christ Christ is that
[31:19] Genesis 1:26 men that never fell Jesus
[31:21] never fell but he came in to our fallen
[31:25] whatever you wanna call it dimension
[31:28] whatever he didn't fall he came into
[31:31] this fallen condition
[31:33] but remember his the effect on him was
[31:36] that he got older remember him Satan
[31:40] would have left him alone
[31:41] this is profound if Satan would have
[31:45] left Jesus alone he too died an old man
[31:50] and we'd still have a problem but same
[31:55] put him on cross and you and I were
[31:59] inside of it and then on the day of
[32:02] Pentecost here we come
[32:05] 120 little jesus's then 3,000 little
[32:09] Jesus now Satan's got millions of little
[32:12] Jesus he's one that he's kind of like
[32:14] that guy that he tries to kill one and
[32:16] thirty comes out and kills another in 30
[32:18] cars tell me this morning when Bob was
[32:21] preaching them or teaching on the corn
[32:24] of wheat you know you take one corn of
[32:26] wheat put it in the ground when it comes
[32:29] out at least has two ears on the stock
[32:32] ears of corn that has six to eight
[32:34] hundred seeds on each one take those and
[32:37] dry them out and put them in the ground
[32:39] you see how the seed but because of one
[32:42] seed Christ Jesus Christ not Christ
[32:45] Jesus Christ one in the ground
[32:47] you can't put Christ in the ground but
[32:50] Jesus Christ went in the ground one see
[32:53] now what a hundred and twenty seeds came
[32:56] up then three thousand seeds came up and
[32:59] as a word went forth millions of seed
[33:02] there'll be millions of people because
[33:04] of that one corn of wheat that went in
[33:06] the ground
[33:07] hey ma'am now let's read quote number
[33:16] one everybody all right with that so we
[33:17] got the stage set we we got excuse me
[33:21] we've got the church ages in order I
[33:23] believe don't you think we're just
[33:25] worried about our Gentile AIDS now I
[33:27] believe that there was a church age in
[33:29] the Old Testament because I can see it
[33:30] the prophet of God said it was so we see
[33:33] that Christ came at the end of the age
[33:34] same thing was here Christ is coming
[33:36] what comes at the end of the age our
[33:38] agenda or I'm sorry Elijah to introduce
[33:41] Christ and and I
[33:46] I'm gonna say this with with all respect
[33:48] but there's no way brother branham could
[33:50] have been here for what we're in now I
[33:56] must decrease he must increase Christ
[34:01] ain't gonna share his glory with nobody
[34:03] and I don't want him to you know because
[34:06] we'd be looking at two we need to be
[34:09] looking at what amen
[34:11] we know brother Brennan what did it he
[34:13] introduced us to Christ he wasn't Christ
[34:15] he introduced us to cry but now we can
[34:18] look back and see where Christ came from
[34:20] he came what through that man remember
[34:23] the mighty angel came down and brought a
[34:25] message to open the seals to read bring
[34:31] us to full Redemption we'll see that in
[34:33] just a minute because look when I say
[34:36] who is worthy the first thing you say is
[34:39] you saw it was Jesus Christ
[34:41] sure but remember he's the first fruit
[34:46] he's that first seed that went in the
[34:48] ground and because he went in the ground
[34:51] and what got a body change he said where
[34:58] I am you will be also she is him my
[35:06] people the breech look at number 1
[35:15] notice he is not an animal he took the
[35:19] book out of the right hand and him set
[35:21] up on the throne who was it the owner
[35:23] the original owner that had the book of
[35:25] redemption in his right hand no angel no
[35:28] angelic being nothing else could take
[35:30] the place and this bloody lamb walked
[35:33] out and took the book out of his hand
[35:34] what is it brother
[35:36] this is the most sublime thing in the
[35:38] scripture I that not an angel not
[35:41] nothing could do it and the lamb come
[35:44] and took it from the right hand of him
[35:46] that set up on the throne what is it now
[35:48] it belongs to the lamb yeah man
[35:51] alright let's go to the number two or
[35:52] three and then we'll then we'll get
[35:53] started these I've already read before
[35:55] but now look at number two the breech no
[35:57] we're look
[35:59] still in the breeze now remember because
[36:02] we haven't gotten to the opening of the
[36:04] seals yet but we have to him be in
[36:07] position remember we talked about the
[36:10] breech the breech birth week we can't
[36:12] come feet first we got to come head
[36:14] first and man so we got to come head
[36:16] first go that's the head all right so
[36:18] the breech the property guard is is
[36:20] showing us how listen God doesn't ever
[36:24] have to explain himself but he does
[36:26] right he doesn't have to explain who he
[36:29] is but he he has to though for you and I
[36:32] and our finite condition can understand
[36:34] an infinite God so he what he comes down
[36:37] to not make yourself smaller he comes
[36:40] down to make yourself bigger through his
[36:43] people through you and eyelet that's
[36:46] what a brother down one stomach this
[36:48] morning Adam had a long and gone head
[36:50] along you to talk to Adam well Adam was
[36:52] in God the Creator standing here they
[36:59] alo him let us make man in our own image
[37:02] now where did that man come from he in
[37:05] creating remember oh yeah you say well
[37:07] it created well we've already been
[37:09] through that you know that that word
[37:11] create means form there's no way that
[37:13] you and I in that Genesis 1:26 have a
[37:15] beginning you hear me that Genesis 1:26
[37:20] man never had a beginning or it's gonna
[37:22] have an end I rest my soul at that thing
[37:26] right there Genesis 1:26 man never had a
[37:29] beginning cuz if I can connect to that
[37:32] then I'll never have an end amen
[37:35] that all right now Genesis 1:26 man is
[37:40] very important that is Christ but when
[37:45] God stand ándale him standing here by
[37:48] self he brings somebody into being and
[37:53] it's in a multiple form and it's his all
[37:57] of his bride down through the church
[37:58] ages I was thinking why brother Dale was
[38:01] preaching this morning we actually as
[38:04] believers even in this message are tunas
[38:11] crash enough cry enough brother Brown
[38:17] said if you see two ones got to be God
[38:20] and the other ones got to be the what
[38:24] die Diablo hey man
[38:31] mucho Caliente hi the devil when we
[38:37] start realizing that Christ came here to
[38:39] tell us we were one not two but we all
[38:44] like just like I said who is worthy
[38:46] first thing we said well I know were
[38:47] they you're not in the condition that
[38:50] you're thinking Urena amen but he's
[38:53] worthy and if he's worthy and I was in
[38:57] him that makes me worthy cuz I trust him
[39:02] I don't trust me I trust him all right
[39:06] look the breach that's what the Holy
[39:09] Spirit's been doing he goes he inspects
[39:11] that's the reason you can't have these
[39:13] things you have spoken tongues I shouted
[39:15] I danced in the spirit I don't have
[39:17] nothing to do with it Holy Spirit
[39:18] inspects that person until he's
[39:19] thoroughly satisfied and knows that they
[39:22] are then they are sealed unto their
[39:24] eternal destination there's not nothing
[39:26] can ever break that seal the Bible
[39:29] you're putting scripture down visions
[39:30] for 36 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[39:32] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[39:34] your Redemption now we're talking about
[39:35] Redemption we look hold that word
[39:37] Redemption until the day that the book
[39:40] of Redemption has been revealed made
[39:45] known seal has been broke the rider
[39:50] rides home but there's something left
[39:53] for me and you this is what we're doing
[40:04] this has been already exposed
[40:08] the wild horse riders the Antichrist but
[40:12] but no one he's the anti-crisis not
[40:14] gonna change your body knowing what was
[40:17] written underneath that seals what's
[40:19] gonna change your body and man cuz look
[40:21] keep weird Empson Redemption Redemption
[40:23] we're going to become about Redemption
[40:25] Redemption Redemption book of redemption
[40:28] the breach is where the redemption comes
[40:30] in sure the devil has to be exposed
[40:38] because he's riding down through these
[40:40] search ages spitting out his doctrine
[40:44] but there had to come a time that what
[40:46] we need to me to me when he was exposed
[40:50] he was dead cuz in Revelations 5 show me
[40:55] look in your Bible show me one place the
[40:58] devil's in there everybody's gonna show
[41:05] me you were reading again he's not in
[41:13] there now he's in revelation 6 because
[41:18] that's showing you how what that man
[41:21] picked that book up the books menu hold
[41:33] that word redemption until the day that
[41:36] the book of redemption has been revealed
[41:39] and the Redeemer comes to claim his
[41:42] possession nothing can do it don't
[41:46] grieve it do the things that please God
[41:49] for the book is sealed now and you are
[41:51] sealed and then excuse me now number 3
[41:55] revelation chapter 5 verse 1 chapter 5 1
[41:59] let's just read the red part look this
[42:03] is not written in the word it's sealed
[42:05] in the back of the book back of the word
[42:06] the book was sealed by these seven seals
[42:09] let me hold them rain the whole mystery
[42:11] of the book is sealed up in those seven
[42:14] seals this is one of the most greatest
[42:17] chapters in the whole book of Revelation
[42:19] why because if we don't get this right
[42:22] if we don't get them if we don't get the
[42:25] birth right if we don't get the head
[42:27] right we're not going to understand
[42:29] revelation 6 7 8 and obviously we're not
[42:33] going to get to 19 cuz in 19 look we're
[42:37] ready we're ready to go the wife has
[42:43] made herself ready not in the process of
[42:49] making ready but ready standing there's
[42:52] one day we're gonna stand ready for
[42:56] whatever God brings this is one of the
[43:03] most greatest chapters in the whole book
[43:05] of Revelation and I saw in the right
[43:09] hand of him that sat upon the throne a
[43:10] book written within inside written
[43:13] that's what we're reading this morning
[43:14] the backside sealed with seven seals
[43:16] outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't
[43:18] even say now listen what does the Bible
[43:22] not say the Bible never says in the book
[43:26] that Wade Dale owned December the 17th
[43:30] 1997 he's going to come to a realization
[43:33] that he's lost you can't find that in
[43:36] the book but it's written from Genesis
[43:39] 1:26 all the way to revelations 19 I'm
[43:46] in the whole book you're in the whole
[43:49] book it's not written anywhere where
[43:51] brother Raphael one day comes to God and
[43:53] he does this and he is this and he does
[43:55] this but everything in that book typed
[43:59] you and I never want to preach that
[44:03] sermon when that literal literal is not
[44:06] a type I mean I'm a literally way Dale
[44:09] I'm that person I'm not a type of me I
[44:12] am that person
[44:15] if you're ever going to be mrs. Jesus
[44:18] Christ you have to realize you not a
[44:20] second person that's our problem Adam
[44:30] and Eve literally was one person now you
[44:34] and I because of the fall take me that
[44:39] way
[44:40] June and I are one as one can be but
[44:45] they can take her DNA and my DNA and
[44:48] they're different but if Adam and Eve
[44:50] went to the doctor and the doctor took a
[44:53] sample of her blood in a sample of his
[44:55] blood and he's in confound he couldn't
[44:59] found the scientist you can't do that
[45:02] well in God you can cuz the Bible says
[45:06] will have a body laughing to his
[45:08] glorious body boy it makes me feel good
[45:11] he's gonna change me even in the atoms
[45:18] he's gonna change my DNA not that I
[45:22] would different but I don't know where
[45:28] it came from
[45:29] and you know what we're not gonna do
[45:31] that that to me that's why the Prophet
[45:33] came brother Ram came to show us it's
[45:35] all gonna happen right here all other
[45:38] denominations everybody in the world
[45:40] believes we got to go somewhere to get
[45:43] all this when we get to heaven we're
[45:48] gonna
[45:52] I thought the mighty angel came down I
[45:58] thought Redemption happens on earth
[46:01] Redemption doesn't happen in heaven
[46:03] Redemption happens here if you're in
[46:06] heaven you're already redeemed that's
[46:17] why that the people are waiting in that
[46:21] other dimension to get back here they're
[46:28] waiting to come back here the only
[46:31] reason they're not here cuz we have not
[46:33] conquered death yet why would you want
[46:37] to come from a place that's so sublime
[46:39] there's a to eternal life back into this
[46:41] thing but one day one day somebody is
[46:46] gonna stand here and that's gonna crawl
[46:48] up your arm you're gonna say you have no
[46:50] hold on me I am worthy because of that
[46:56] man and then they're gonna come from
[47:00] that dimension and step right over into
[47:02] this way get their flesh body and we're
[47:05] gonna step over into another one and
[47:08] wait till this thing's burn off those
[47:16] people in that Curt across that curtain
[47:18] of time they told William Brennan if you
[47:22] had no car sure they know Jesus Christ
[47:26] saved their soul amen but they said
[47:29] William Branham if you hadn't come if
[47:33] you hadn't come you're the one that
[47:36] planted the seed remember Paul Barnabas
[47:40] and all the one watered one planet one
[47:42] gets God gets increase right Paul
[47:45] planted Barnabas watered washing of the
[47:49] water of the word but who gets increase
[47:50] God's the one that's on the one who's
[47:52] worthy we know that but we're gonna have
[47:55] to see though that we're not Adam and
[47:58] Eve weren't two separate people they
[48:00] were one person
[48:05] a man they were literally boned of their
[48:08] bone in flex with their flesh and if the
[48:12] first Adam and Eve did that then guess
[48:15] why you're not going to be the same boy
[48:18] ain't even close to getting started that
[48:23] all right everybody sorry didn't mean to
[48:27] holler oh yeah I did
[48:31] let's go to number let's go to number
[48:34] four he's getting happy when you see
[48:39] something you know I just get happy when
[48:40] a season and the strong angel with a
[48:43] loud voice proclaim who is worthy who is
[48:46] able to do this then the elder says
[48:49] don't wait for the Lion of the tribe of
[48:51] Judah he is worthy and he has overcome
[48:53] now we're going to talk a little bit
[48:55] later about overcoming because remember
[48:58] you got to overcome there's got to be
[48:59] something like brother dev summit it
[49:01] there was not being overcoming if we
[49:03] just come the first way what would we
[49:06] have overcome nothing but here now we've
[49:09] got testimonies that were we're going to
[49:12] talk about free eternity what God did
[49:15] for us then the elders who don't wait
[49:19] for the line of tribe of Judah he is
[49:21] worthy and here is overcoming and he
[49:23] took the book and opened the book and
[49:24] loosed the seals thereof he never told
[49:27] what happened to them when we hit them
[49:29] seven seals being opened right down
[49:31] through the Bible what's what took place
[49:33] right in this seven sealed book that
[49:36] were in that we're we're entered now
[49:39] holds the whole mystery of all what the
[49:42] redemption blessings of God so when
[49:46] these seals open you and I are supposed
[49:48] to see the redemptive blessings of God
[49:51] not just that the white horse rider was
[49:54] the Antichrist
[49:55] then he had a bow in the house and he
[49:57] was a bluff sure that's what we're
[49:58] supposed to see it first
[49:59] but there's something underneath that
[50:02] it's got to be redemption who is worthy
[50:11] let's go to number five the breach
[50:15] now I and a strong angel now verse 2 the
[50:18] strong angel with a loud voice
[50:19] proclaiming who is worthy worthy for
[50:22] what who is worthy to take that book now
[50:26] we find out where's the book at now to
[50:29] its original owner because it had been
[50:32] forfeited by a son the first son of God
[50:41] in the human race which was who items
[50:45] what brother Dells preaching on now and
[50:47] when he forfeited his right to listen to
[50:51] Satan see that's what we blow Eve up
[50:54] about all this we know the act came
[50:56] through but what's what did he do he
[50:59] accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's
[51:02] work so he was the son of God the Bible
[51:07] says he was the son of God the Prophet
[51:10] said he was the son of God but the book
[51:12] then what happened then Adam had the
[51:16] ability to do whatever he wanted to on
[51:19] the earth multiply and replenish the
[51:23] earth and subdue it and have dominion he
[51:26] had all these characteristics that he
[51:28] had to fulfill but he couldn't do it
[51:30] once he crossed the chasm you know you
[51:33] can say what you want to about what Adam
[51:35] did with Eve but there's one thing for
[51:37] sure Adam thought he could save Eve but
[51:43] he couldn't there's only one Savior
[51:45] that's what we're talking about here
[51:47] there's only one man worthy Adam wasn't
[51:50] worthy he thought maybe he could be but
[51:54] brother Rob said when he got out when he
[51:56] went out with Eve there's no way he
[51:58] could get back cuz he was not he was not
[52:04] the creator he was not the Redeemer he
[52:08] was not the healer Adam had a place you
[52:12] and I have a play everybody's got a
[52:13] place but and so does God God's place is
[52:17] he's everything but Adam got out and
[52:20] couldn't get back he lost the ability
[52:23] look watch who was the original owner to
[52:29] its original
[52:30] the original owner was Elohim the
[52:33] creator is the one that developed this
[52:36] book called Genesis 1:26 and he handed
[52:39] part of it to Adam and through Adam and
[52:43] Eve he was going to produce the rest of
[52:45] it
[52:46] amen but Satan got involved he forfeited
[52:54] his right to listen to Satan he give up
[52:58] what did he do he accepted Satan's
[53:00] wisdom instead of God's Word so that's
[53:02] why that then God said I'll put enmity
[53:07] between thy seed and the seed of the
[53:09] woman
[53:10] a division enmity alright a division
[53:12] that's our problem the carnal mind it's
[53:16] kind of strange that we were born with a
[53:18] carnal mind and basically we still got
[53:21] one I mean we have the mind of Christ
[53:23] and we're supposed to have you know but
[53:25] sometimes we like like Bob said this
[53:27] morning we've the flus get stopped up
[53:29] and we can't get all that out all right
[53:31] you know but we're supposed to have the
[53:33] mind of Christ right but that's what
[53:36] we're doing we're getting all these flus
[53:38] through all this through all these hours
[53:40] and fifty and sixty years after the
[53:42] Prophet we're getting the flu clean down
[53:48] the chimney sweep the Holy Ghost is
[53:51] coming up there nice taking this take it
[53:55] what he's taking the flus and he's
[53:57] cleaning them out so that's what
[53:59] happened Adam his flus got stopped down
[54:01] but the original owner was God Almighty
[54:04] Himself hey man he owns everything amen
[54:09] but he was going to give part of it to
[54:12] Adam and then he give out he give Eve to
[54:16] Adam to reproduce itself not sexually
[54:19] not to the loins of man any more loins
[54:22] it's down here now it's up here the
[54:25] spoken word is the original seed speak
[54:28] the word and it'll happen he even told
[54:31] Moses and Moses why are you crying
[54:33] speak same way with you and I
[54:39] but he lost the ability to produce the
[54:43] book Adam Adam lost that ability to
[54:48] produce the book and who is the book I
[54:50] got a list here I was listening to just
[54:52] few minutes ago there's the book the
[54:55] book consists of Christ and his bride
[54:58] foolish virgin fifth seal Jew 144,000
[55:01] cup of water my name the earth the
[55:06] future huh I mean the millennium and the
[55:08] future home
[55:08] that's what consist of this book and
[55:12] it's nothing without the people in it
[55:15] when the city of Gainesville the bottle
[55:19] of Bible sorry the newspaper says the
[55:22] city of Gainesville come out to the
[55:24] parade today well all the buildings
[55:27] didn't hop out in front of them right
[55:30] I'm not gonna do that again
[55:33] that hurt but who came out that people
[55:40] the people came out and walked along
[55:42] that was the city of Gainesville it's
[55:46] not the literal book you and I were the
[55:48] literal book we're not gonna have a book
[55:52] in heaven where we all go when our
[55:54] sister Anna Cunard you're right here no
[55:56] you're gonna say no I'm right here I'm
[56:00] not in the book anymore because the book
[56:03] was taken by the lamb hey man all right
[56:11] I promise you ain't gonna jump I'm
[56:13] telling it again
[56:13] I have lost a little weight but not that
[56:16] much yet but he lost the ability to
[56:19] produce all this Adam did remember the
[56:22] first item failed the second Adam will
[56:25] not fail did not fail that's what we put
[56:29] all of our attention to then in
[56:31] Revelations 5 is that is that even
[56:36] listen in our understanding listen I
[56:38] said in our understanding Christ wasn't
[56:40] fully revealed in the church ages
[56:45] partial partial truth
[56:50] partial truth but then that which is
[56:53] perfect is come that which is in part to
[56:56] be done away with a man there's only one
[56:59] perfect one and that's cross but you and
[57:01] I as the bride if we've made our self
[57:05] ready here what you hear what I'm saying
[57:09] he says the wife has made herself ready
[57:19] but Adam lost the ability to produce the
[57:22] book so God took the book back God's the
[57:25] only one worthy Christ is the only one
[57:28] worth he has the book he has control of
[57:32] it all that's why down through the
[57:34] through the Old Testament you would see
[57:37] him show up but not the book hold on
[57:42] you sho know that I read it to you last
[57:44] Sunday Redemption wasn't in the Old
[57:47] Testament right I'll read it to you next
[57:50] Sunday
[57:50] cuz I'm not gonna bring this Sunday but
[57:52] next Sunday brother Branham said souls
[57:54] in prison he said not in the Old
[57:55] Testament nobody in the Old Testament
[57:58] had this Genesis 1:26 men in their soul
[58:01] they had an anointing just like I know
[58:04] it listen to me I said just like
[58:05] anointing ones that's why the property
[58:07] guard to look back and he said that
[58:09] anointing to come on David he was
[58:11] speaking the first person but when that
[58:12] anointing comes off of David
[58:13] he'd have his best friend killed and
[58:17] commit adultery but God's not looking at
[58:20] that God's looking through what the eyes
[58:23] of the Redeemer but he's not redeemed
[58:27] yet David's not redeemed yet Abraham's
[58:31] not redeemed yet Isaiah's not redeemed
[58:34] yet no sir they without us
[58:40] cannot be made perfect they without us
[58:44] can't come to a place where they see
[58:46] Christ like you and I see cross there's
[58:48] nobody not even to the church ages this
[58:51] terrorize think about this yesterday
[58:52] said understand there's nothing ever
[58:54] unfolded to a group of people like today
[58:57] nothing nothing
[59:00] even Paul pumps that I look through a
[59:03] glass darkly I don't know what's coming
[59:05] but look we've come right here we can
[59:07] look all the way back down through those
[59:09] ages we can see every characteristic of
[59:12] God that's already been made manifest
[59:16] and you and I are standing right here
[59:22] let me ask you a question was any of
[59:27] that hid from Christ was any of that
[59:32] hidden from Christ no he's the one who
[59:35] brought he's the one who brought him you
[59:39] don't you think Christ didn't know what
[59:41] Martin Luther was gonna do when Christ
[59:42] came to Martin Luther and gave him a new
[59:43] birth he knew exactly what Martin Luther
[59:45] was gonna do and you know what he was
[59:47] happy with that but he wasn't fully
[59:51] satisfied he was happy with that but he
[59:54] wasn't fully satisfied that all right
[59:58] now look number six as soon as he's made
[1:00:08] as he made when this angel this mighty
[1:00:11] angel cried out who is worthy
[1:00:13] he was advertising right then he was
[1:00:17] advertising for a kinsman redeemer and
[1:00:20] immediately after he said who is worthy
[1:00:23] to take the book then something then
[1:00:26] John started weep then what happened
[1:00:30] he's seen somebody read that for me
[1:00:33] there stood the book
[1:00:36] now wait a minute there stood the book
[1:00:44] there stood the book not this there
[1:00:51] stood the book there it was but who was
[1:00:54] worthy well there stood Gabriel of
[1:01:00] course he was worthy but see he wasn't a
[1:01:03] man he was an angel there stood Michael
[1:01:07] he was worthy but he wasn't a man he was
[1:01:10] an angel so it had to be somebody that
[1:01:14] became a earthly person like we did and
[1:01:18] when he seen this Lamb that had been
[1:01:21] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:01:23] come up and he seemed that he had been
[1:01:25] slain
[1:01:26] all the way to the foundation of the
[1:01:28] world then John what they meant because
[1:01:30] there it was he saw the whole thing now
[1:01:32] let's read the next one now look he saw
[1:01:37] the whole thing
[1:01:38] now what was look he was he saw a lamb
[1:01:41] that was slain from the foundation of
[1:01:43] the world now this is not in there this
[1:01:45] is not in their notes but I just picked
[1:01:48] this up revelation 13:8 that kind of
[1:01:54] ring a bell revelation 13:8 says all
[1:01:57] would be deceived except those that were
[1:02:00] written in the book of the life of the
[1:02:01] Lamb before the foundation of world what
[1:02:03] is Hebrews 13:8 say Jesus Christ the
[1:02:07] same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:11] revelation 13:8 in Hebrews 13:8 the same
[1:02:14] identical thing amen all right all right
[1:02:16] say man all right so the Old Testament
[1:02:20] to John here we come up the old
[1:02:21] testament of john christ comes on the
[1:02:22] scene sorry cross died to release the
[1:02:26] life to come into these people cuz he
[1:02:28] wasn't in these people in a new birth he
[1:02:31] didn't reside that okay he didn't reside
[1:02:35] in these people he would anoint them and
[1:02:38] then when the anointing would leave
[1:02:40] Moses he would anoint Moses speaking the
[1:02:43] first person amen
[1:02:46] flies fleas and frogs but now when Moses
[1:02:49] went and killed that Egyptian that was
[1:02:50] across that was Moses the man a man
[1:02:55] because what the holy ghost would come
[1:02:57] on them do what he wanted to do and then
[1:03:00] he would pull off right because remember
[1:03:02] even John the the Bible says date that
[1:03:05] the Holy Ghost told John says who you
[1:03:08] see the spirit descend and remain
[1:03:12] because John being a prophet he could
[1:03:15] see that see that's why John had a
[1:03:17] problem John had a problem because he
[1:03:21] could walk into the temple in coccus
[1:03:23] he'd see the anointing see if John the
[1:03:26] brother Brian could pick that anointing
[1:03:28] up so could John the Baptist that was
[1:03:30] that whole message of a lives of that
[1:03:31] whole Ministry of Elijah was able to
[1:03:33] pick up spirits so John the Baptist
[1:03:36] would pick up a spirit he'd walk close
[1:03:38] to that temple and he'd see the
[1:03:39] anointing following caucus and he would
[1:03:42] prophesy and it'd be true but confers
[1:03:46] put Jesus on the cross
[1:03:47] amen so Elijah John the Baptist who you
[1:03:52] see the spirit descend and remain
[1:03:57] behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:04:00] the sin of the world that anointing came
[1:04:03] down on Jesus and stayed there didn't
[1:04:05] make him God Bobby read a quote this
[1:04:09] morning the fullness of the Godhead
[1:04:12] bodily was in that baby
[1:04:17] what was that own bomb you remember okay
[1:04:21] well if you if you watch it you'll see
[1:04:23] where brother Branham said the fullness
[1:04:24] of the Godhead bodily it was lying in a
[1:04:26] manger another word so what happened on
[1:04:30] the river Jordan we know that we've all
[1:04:31] been taught so well hid the anointing
[1:04:34] first ministry had no ministry until he
[1:04:36] was thirty years old because no priest
[1:04:38] could preach until he was thirty years
[1:04:40] old so the anointing comes on Jesus for
[1:04:43] her three and a half year ministry and
[1:04:44] then the Bible says the anointing left
[1:04:46] him even the Prophet says anointing left
[1:04:48] him in the garden watch so he could die
[1:04:49] he couldn't die with that three and a
[1:04:50] half of your ministry that's why I'm
[1:04:53] telling you there's nothing holding me
[1:04:58] in you the Prophet had to decrease so
[1:05:02] that Christ could increase but they
[1:05:04] don't say that
[1:05:05] - Brian go she is him and we get that
[1:05:09] three and a half year ministry guess
[1:05:11] what we don't die you'll realize that
[1:05:16] one of these days number seven the
[1:05:20] Angels call was the call for a kinsman
[1:05:22] redeemer to appear God said I have a law
[1:05:24] a kinsman redeemer can be a substitute
[1:05:27] where is that kinsman redeemer who's
[1:05:30] able to take it and it came from Adam
[1:05:33] all the way down through all the
[1:05:35] apostles and prophets and everything
[1:05:38] else and nobody was found now what about
[1:05:42] that nobody in heaven nobody on earth
[1:05:45] nobody that ever lived
[1:05:49] Elisha was standing there we think he
[1:05:52] might be worthy nope Moses was standing
[1:05:55] there all the apostles were standing
[1:05:58] there of all the ones that had died all
[1:06:02] the holy man job the sages everyone was
[1:06:06] standing there and nobody was worthy
[1:06:08] even to look at the book let alone to
[1:06:11] take it and break the seals because look
[1:06:13] if you took the book you had to be able
[1:06:16] to redeem everything in that book that
[1:06:23] just makes sense to me I mean you can't
[1:06:25] read that in the Bible anywhere but that
[1:06:26] just make sense if you're able to take
[1:06:29] the book you got to be worthy to take it
[1:06:31] and you got to be able to do something
[1:06:33] with it when you take it you're not just
[1:06:35] gonna take the book say well I got the
[1:06:36] book no you gotta be able to do
[1:06:38] something with it
[1:06:38] right that's what he just says take it
[1:06:42] and break the seals okay all right done
[1:06:46] all right say man now number that seven
[1:06:49] number eight now let's take a little bit
[1:06:54] on Redemption Redemption have you heard
[1:06:55] that before
[1:06:56] Redemption before this person could be
[1:07:00] could redeem the first thing he had to
[1:07:01] be worthy he had to be the right kind of
[1:07:04] person person so this was accomplished
[1:07:08] when Jesus Christ was born a virgin
[1:07:11] birth for he was good he was God Himself
[1:07:15] made a man he was
[1:07:16] God in human flesh he had to be worthy
[1:07:19] and the virgin blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:21] made him worthy now we find that if you
[1:07:25] want to go to the scripture first Peter
[1:07:26] 1:18 2:20 if you're keeping the
[1:07:28] scriptures or keep going he prevailed
[1:07:31] God took on the form of human flesh he
[1:07:34] came to the earth was born a little baby
[1:07:36] and walked among us and through his holy
[1:07:38] blood he prevailed now let's read let's
[1:07:42] read what he said to read first Peter
[1:07:46] 1:18 let's go to first Peter 1:18 for as
[1:07:51] much as you know that you were not
[1:07:53] redeemed with corruptible things
[1:07:56] whatever took the book could not be
[1:07:59] corruptible because what was in the book
[1:08:02] at one time listen to me at one time was
[1:08:05] corruptible because Redemption is you
[1:08:07] went from here to here and back to here
[1:08:09] right so we had to fall that was a fall
[1:08:13] in there somewhere because like like
[1:08:18] Brooke like brother Dale says there's
[1:08:20] nothing to redeem if you're already
[1:08:22] perfect there's nothing to redeem but
[1:08:25] you and I are redeemable because we fail
[1:08:28] ok we're redeemable because this is what
[1:08:31] happened down here for as much as you
[1:08:34] know that you were not redeemed with
[1:08:36] corruptible things as silver and gold
[1:08:37] from your vain conversation received by
[1:08:40] tradition from your father's but with
[1:08:43] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[1:08:45] lamb without blemish and without spot
[1:08:48] who verily was foreordained before the
[1:08:51] foundation of the world but was manifest
[1:08:55] in these last times for you and watch
[1:09:00] times 2,000 years in these last times
[1:09:05] these last two thousand years Christ is
[1:09:07] what he was foreordained to what
[1:09:09] manifest himself through seven church
[1:09:11] ages but he's not finished the heads got
[1:09:20] to come back
[1:09:21] revelations 9 I mean sorry revelations 5
[1:09:24] this is to quote number 9 and soon as he
[1:09:27] advertised who is worthy
[1:09:28] he was advert
[1:09:30] housing the coming of the kinsman
[1:09:32] redeemer and here he stood a lamb and
[1:09:35] what did he do
[1:09:36] walked over to the throne look now
[1:09:39] remember this is a scene and to get this
[1:09:42] scene you have to have some spiritual
[1:09:44] thinking nearby alright without you got
[1:09:47] to have some spiritual thinking the
[1:09:49] second thing you gotta do is wake up
[1:09:59] hyah hyah
[1:10:01] he was advertising the coming of a
[1:10:03] kinsman redeemer and here he stood a
[1:10:06] lamb what did he do walked over to the
[1:10:09] throne where the Spirit of God was now
[1:10:10] in the scene you'd think that's two
[1:10:12] people but remember God is manifesting
[1:10:16] self in another form God's one but now
[1:10:22] you got to remember one thing y'all
[1:10:23] forget so do I say y'all I say y'all
[1:10:26] everybody don't mean y'all y'all forget
[1:10:29] that if he more feet is last in Morpheus
[1:10:32] in a bride that's not a second person
[1:10:37] our problem is is we think we're it's a
[1:10:41] good person we're not we are the person
[1:10:46] of God manifested in another form this
[1:10:49] is the Spirit of God you see this you
[1:10:51] see one person is sitting on throne with
[1:10:52] a book right one guy's sitting on throne
[1:10:56] with a book in his hand and there's
[1:10:59] another man gonna come around a man cuz
[1:11:02] it says a man come around because a lamb
[1:11:04] can't take a book out of somebody's hand
[1:11:07] lamb don't have hands and a lamb can't
[1:11:11] be bloody once the lamb dies he's dead
[1:11:13] but this lamb could walked over to the
[1:11:18] throne where the Spirit of God was that
[1:11:20] I want you to look
[1:11:22] the Spirit of God the Son of God what
[1:11:25] was he down to the church ages he was
[1:11:29] revealed as the son of God upon this
[1:11:31] rock I'll build my church Peter says
[1:11:33] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:11:35] Living God you thought that doesn't mean
[1:11:37] anything that means a lot
[1:11:39] the manifestation of God was the son of
[1:11:42] God down to the church ages not the son
[1:11:45] of man the son of man's two headstone
[1:11:50] that's why they're all in the grave
[1:11:52] right walked over to the throne where
[1:11:57] the Spirit of God was at and took the
[1:12:00] book out of the right hand remember
[1:12:01] right hand is what authority of him that
[1:12:04] sets upon the throne and all the elders
[1:12:06] fell down and said thou art worthy
[1:12:08] because thou was slain and then he
[1:12:11] become them watch this his book or at
[1:12:15] least the book of Redemption now look
[1:12:18] we're fixing he's fixing to open the
[1:12:20] seals and this is the book this is the
[1:12:25] book of redemption not the book of the
[1:12:28] devil we got to see this to continue
[1:12:34] into the seal we got to see this the
[1:12:37] book or at least a book of redemption or
[1:12:39] the book of intercession remember he was
[1:12:43] interceding he's still interceding but
[1:12:49] there's time watch the book of
[1:12:53] intercession in the church age was
[1:12:55] finished now he becomes the Redeemer
[1:13:09] now Redemption Redemption is to be
[1:13:16] revealed let's read this now the
[1:13:18] revealing of how he did it see I wasn't
[1:13:22] just saying that was my thought remember
[1:13:27] I said this is what happened but this is
[1:13:29] how he told us I didn't get that from my
[1:13:31] guy from him the revealing of how he did
[1:13:36] it is going to be in the seventh sense
[1:13:38] which is Revelation chapter six now we
[1:13:40] notice in that light when the book of
[1:13:42] the mediatorial work of him was done the
[1:13:45] work was finished now in the first three
[1:13:47] chapters of the church finished right
[1:13:50] here this is revelations one through
[1:13:53] three
[1:13:53] right and then wake up this is important
[1:13:58] Josh young set up all night and watch
[1:14:01] all you want to but you can't say turn
[1:14:02] but now redemption redemption is what to
[1:14:07] be revealed he's just not gonna take the
[1:14:09] book and just go no if this is the most
[1:14:13] greatest scripture in the Bible amen
[1:14:18] brother Brent said to scriptures Daniel
[1:14:22] 9 was the most important Scripture in
[1:14:24] the Bible revelations 5 was the most
[1:14:26] sublime Scripture in the Bible so those
[1:14:28] two to me revelation
[1:14:31] I mean Daniel 9 shows the redemption of
[1:14:34] Israel revelations 5 shows the
[1:14:37] redemption to me in here redemption is
[1:14:40] to be revealed what is it now when he
[1:14:43] took this book now try to put your deep
[1:14:45] thinking not your deep sleeping your
[1:14:51] deep thinking because we ever get these
[1:14:53] seven nights you're gonna get it you're
[1:14:56] gonna get it now well they didn't but he
[1:15:00] thought they might now let's go to
[1:15:03] number 10 number 10 breach we're gonna
[1:15:08] stand in the breach and he saw one
[1:15:11] sending him of the throne with this book
[1:15:12] in his hand and his right hand think of
[1:15:14] it now and then in this book what's the
[1:15:17] title deed to Redemption and it was
[1:15:21] sealed with seven seals
[1:15:22] now look so it was sealed with seven
[1:15:24] seals I've lost my seal here it is it's
[1:15:27] sealed with seven seals now obviously
[1:15:31] people obviously man thought for
[1:15:35] centuries that this seal was you and I
[1:15:42] yeah cuz even brother Branham preached
[1:15:45] this first seal was the Holy Ghost right
[1:15:52] so man through the ages thought this was
[1:15:55] something great that had to stop do me
[1:15:57] and you they missed this they missed
[1:16:02] this
[1:16:02] this was the revelation they were
[1:16:04] supposed to get not this
[1:16:06] so the profit comes Christ comes takes
[1:16:09] the sail off and then he walked reveals
[1:16:12] what's in the book then in this book was
[1:16:15] to end this book not old in in this book
[1:16:20] was the title deed to redemption and it
[1:16:23] was sealed with seven seals and then an
[1:16:26] angel come forth the strong angel
[1:16:28] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:16:30] worthy to open the book and to take the
[1:16:34] book who was able to open the seals who
[1:16:36] was able to open this book see the angel
[1:16:39] asked it John saw it and he said now
[1:16:41] who's worthy let him oh my maybe I'm
[1:16:44] just feeling this this away but let him
[1:16:47] said the angel lent him here is the book
[1:16:49] of redemption here is the plan of
[1:16:51] redemption listen to this here is the
[1:16:54] only way you'll ever be redeemed
[1:16:59] look how important not the seal what was
[1:17:03] written in the seal what was written
[1:17:05] behind the seal here is the only way
[1:17:08] you'll ever be redeemed for here is the
[1:17:13] title deed to redemption of the whole
[1:17:16] heavens and earth let him come forth if
[1:17:20] he will oh my
[1:17:21] now speaker forever hold his peace let
[1:17:24] him come forward and claim this book who
[1:17:27] is worthy to do it john said there was
[1:17:29] no man in heaven found worthy no man on
[1:17:31] earth found worthy no man beneath the
[1:17:32] earth that ever lived and died was found
[1:17:34] worthy no man was found worthy so who is
[1:17:37] worthy here is the only way you'll ever
[1:17:43] be redeemed I like that the only way
[1:17:46] that you'll ever be redeemed
[1:17:51] now we're gonna shift gears in just a
[1:17:53] second but let me give you this point
[1:17:54] right here
[1:17:55] believe it right there when he takes the
[1:18:00] book listen to me when he takes the book
[1:18:04] that means he's worthy right now what if
[1:18:09] he's worthy I hope you get this if he's
[1:18:13] worthy
[1:18:13] is he gonna reach and get a book that's
[1:18:17] dirty
[1:18:19] is he gonna reach and get a book that's
[1:18:21] sinful is he gonna reach and get a book
[1:18:24] this unworthy what's he reaching to get
[1:18:30] a book that's just as worthy and whose
[1:18:38] the book the book was standing there he
[1:18:42] said the standing there
[1:18:45] he's not gonna reason get something
[1:18:47] filthy folks this shows us that our
[1:18:49] redemption whenever he reached and got
[1:18:52] that book redemption was over when he
[1:18:58] took that book
[1:18:59] everybody had come to full Redemption
[1:19:03] hey Bobby change cuz he's not gonna get
[1:19:11] that book say when that legs up there's
[1:19:12] a part of it let me see that there's a
[1:19:15] I'm just gonna get about three pages of
[1:19:17] this book no without hesitation he
[1:19:21] reached and grabbed the book he said
[1:19:24] it's mine I have redeemed it and
[1:19:27] everybody that's in that book it's
[1:19:29] sealed in and there's no way that Satan
[1:19:32] can get him no way that man can touch
[1:19:35] this book the Lamb the one worthy
[1:19:38] reaching got something that was worthy
[1:19:41] oh I'm sorry that's the second person he
[1:19:51] raised and got himself gong can't you
[1:19:56] see that he got himself he didn't have a
[1:19:59] problem he woke up there now he had
[1:20:01] overcome he was worthy an angel said who
[1:20:06] is worthy everybody just kind of stood
[1:20:07] around but when he raised and got the
[1:20:11] book do you hear what happened I'll
[1:20:16] Hammond scream I'll scream
[1:20:19] everybody heard John scream and for he
[1:20:24] has redeemed us what Redemption
[1:20:29] listen revelation is father's not part
[1:20:32] Redemption that's full Redemption full
[1:20:37] Redemption body spirit and soul so the
[1:20:40] seals has to be connected to your body
[1:20:43] change it can't be just that Satan was a
[1:20:47] wild horse rider
[1:20:48] there's something lying underneath that
[1:20:52] something in Redemption that you and I
[1:20:55] have not seen yet cuz we're still here
[1:21:03] if he was worthy that book was worthy it
[1:21:07] had come to a place to where that book
[1:21:10] was just as worthy as he was because
[1:21:13] when he took it what was it he took that
[1:21:16] book he's a redemption is over now
[1:21:19] redemption is coming not three chapters
[1:21:22] later redemption is over when the lamb
[1:21:27] takes the book we'll read it maybe next
[1:21:30] time be the prophet of God said he said
[1:21:32] redemption was over no look Redemption
[1:21:41] was over for the foundational world but
[1:21:45] the acts of a play had to bring us down
[1:21:47] into time to this part here because look
[1:21:53] let me tell you something the reason I'm
[1:21:56] so hard on this about being worthy you
[1:21:59] can't understand
[1:22:00] when when you start really seeing the
[1:22:02] seals you see how he makes you worthy
[1:22:06] right you see how he makes you worthy
[1:22:11] he's worthy now we know that but like I
[1:22:14] said before when he reached and grabbed
[1:22:15] that book that book couldn't had one
[1:22:18] speck of sin in it so what was that book
[1:22:21] that book was none other than Genesis
[1:22:27] 1:26 through 27
[1:22:33] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:22:35] the sea in the fowl of the air and over
[1:22:37] every creeping thing that creepeth on
[1:22:38] the earth right what revelation 5 we
[1:22:41] just read it says kings and priests and
[1:22:42] we were what reign on this earth we will
[1:22:46] reign
[1:22:47] over there sir brother mom said if your
[1:22:48] priest or King you got to have a domain
[1:22:51] he said you are right there all right
[1:22:58] say ma'am
[1:23:00] number 12 no I'm sorry number 11 now
[1:23:04] let's shift gears here just a second
[1:23:06] watch so keep this in your minds for
[1:23:10] next time if the book is where if the
[1:23:12] man that takes is worthy the book is got
[1:23:14] to be worthy
[1:23:14] so the redemption has got to be done but
[1:23:17] we now just like the Prophet said we got
[1:23:19] to come back into revelation 6 and see
[1:23:21] how it happened
[1:23:22] hey man that's what he said but I watch
[1:23:26] an Elder came forth our strong angel
[1:23:29] said weep not for the line of the tribe
[1:23:30] of Judah the root of David he has
[1:23:32] prevailed a man conquered in other words
[1:23:34] he is worthy to take the book see I want
[1:23:38] to talk a little bit about overcoming
[1:23:39] later on because you got to have
[1:23:41] something to overcome before you can
[1:23:42] overcome it something's got to happen
[1:23:45] because each age got an overcoming our
[1:23:47] overcoming in this age come this age
[1:23:49] here is is that we could sit in his
[1:23:51] throne we'll talk about that next Sunday
[1:23:54] I was gonna take it today but I'm gonna
[1:23:55] come down to a spot right here and then
[1:23:56] stop and then we'll take it next Sunday
[1:24:00] cuz remember these these gifts and all
[1:24:04] these things in the Bible is only for
[1:24:05] overcomers there's not a person in the
[1:24:08] Bible that doesn't have a testimony
[1:24:10] there's not a person on a person sitting
[1:24:12] here if you don't have a testimony
[1:24:14] you're not born again well let me put it
[1:24:17] this way you could be in the process and
[1:24:19] that could be part of your testimony but
[1:24:22] born-again people have a testimony you
[1:24:24] know what it is it's true all the way
[1:24:28] through I can't get born again different
[1:24:31] than you as far as we come to one thing
[1:24:33] that we can all come different
[1:24:34] directions it may take some longer some
[1:24:37] walk some run some crawl right but we
[1:24:41] all come to one place that the word in
[1:24:43] you agrees the spirit and you agrees
[1:24:45] with the word that's been preached and
[1:24:48] it remains problem is we see all these
[1:24:51] people come running running running
[1:24:52] around running and then what
[1:24:56] they had a good anointing but they never
[1:24:59] had a possession now remember he's
[1:25:04] worthy to take the book he's been doing
[1:25:07] the work of the kinsman redeemer my own
[1:25:08] the rock yeah
[1:25:09] here's purple conquered in other words
[1:25:10] he's worthy to take the book hey man
[1:25:12] remember he hadn't seen him up on up to
[1:25:16] this time tell my John why he was
[1:25:18] sitting on a seated on the throne in
[1:25:20] there god stro he was on the inside of
[1:25:23] the sanctuary he wasn't st. he hadn't
[1:25:27] seen him to this time so John was
[1:25:29] expecting to see a line come forth but
[1:25:32] he saw a lamp all right now look a line
[1:25:35] doesn't redeem a lamb it's the only
[1:25:40] sacrifice there has never been a line
[1:25:43] sacrificed sorry no the line isn't
[1:25:46] overcomer the line is the tribe of Judah
[1:25:48] the line is the one that speaks amen
[1:25:51] but the lamb he's meat general you see
[1:25:54] the different characteristics but now
[1:25:55] remember same God but he can be a lion
[1:25:57] in a lamb at the same time but in this
[1:26:00] scene he has to play the part but watch
[1:26:04] but he saw a lamb now let's go to number
[1:26:07] 12 third seal Jeffersonville 1963 and
[1:26:11] then we went back gothic rent kinsman
[1:26:13] redeemer and picked him up see what's
[1:26:15] brother branham's doing he's he's going
[1:26:17] back to the to this to the breach in the
[1:26:21] third seal and when he went back got to
[1:26:23] the kinsman redeemer and picked him up
[1:26:24] to see what his work was and now for all
[1:26:27] these years Christ has been doing the
[1:26:28] kinsman redeemer work
[1:26:30] now all that understands that say man he
[1:26:33] has been doing the work of the kids
[1:26:34] remember lemur but there will come a
[1:26:36] time that when the redeeming work will
[1:26:39] be over and when the redeeming work is
[1:26:42] over then he leaves the throne of God
[1:26:45] where he's seated now but that's not his
[1:26:48] problem he that overcometh shall sit
[1:26:51] with me in my throne as I have overcome
[1:26:54] and have sit down on my Father's throne
[1:26:56] now that's revelations 3 verse I got it
[1:26:59] right here that's gonna read it but I'll
[1:27:00] read softer up there next Sunday that's
[1:27:02] revelation 3:21
[1:27:04] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:27:06] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:27:08] overcame
[1:27:10] and I'm sat down with my father in his
[1:27:12] throne thought alright say man where he
[1:27:15] seated now but that's not his throne he
[1:27:17] that overcometh shall sit with me and my
[1:27:20] throne as I have overcome and have sit
[1:27:22] down on my Father's throne that is not
[1:27:24] his throne that belongs to Spirit God
[1:27:27] Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him
[1:27:31] he is the Incarnate God which is the
[1:27:33] same God made incarnate now will we just
[1:27:36] kind of stop there because I just want
[1:27:37] to read a few of these kind of tickle
[1:27:40] your interest and next Sunday we'll
[1:27:43] continue right here on this but let me
[1:27:44] read a few more now look cuz remember
[1:27:47] who was the lamb the lamb was the
[1:27:53] Redeemer their lamb is the son of man
[1:27:57] God in human flesh but he's the son of
[1:28:02] God in the son of man we know that but
[1:28:04] he wasn't in that son of God
[1:28:05] manifestation at that time he was in the
[1:28:07] son of man hmm
[1:28:09] this is kind of strange but the son of
[1:28:13] God is the new birth right but the son
[1:28:16] of man came in flesh bled and died
[1:28:22] because a kinsman as son of God he
[1:28:26] couldn't bleed and die forth but when he
[1:28:29] in morphing into Son of Man that's when
[1:28:32] he could go back and redeem all his
[1:28:34] possession amen
[1:28:37] cuz look that all right look this right
[1:28:44] here never fell
[1:28:48] never never had a bad day this is
[1:28:53] Almighty God in another form called a
[1:28:56] bride this is the bride he was calling
[1:29:00] his bride right there in Genesis 1:26
[1:29:03] amen created he them and let them have
[1:29:08] dominion over the fish of seeing the
[1:29:10] foul the air and whoever creeping thing
[1:29:12] that creepeth upon the earth and God
[1:29:14] blessed them and said multiply and
[1:29:16] replenish the earth Lord these people
[1:29:18] hadn't even come to earth yet literally
[1:29:22] right
[1:29:23] they're already blessed they're already
[1:29:26] multiplied they already have a Dominion
[1:29:30] none other than Christ himself in the
[1:29:34] form of a bride this is you this is your
[1:29:36] bride amen
[1:29:39] but when we fell we had to get back to
[1:29:41] something right redemption is not
[1:29:45] dropping this and picking up this it's
[1:29:49] dropping this and picking this up and
[1:29:51] putting it the people in the message
[1:29:53] forget this you got to put it back where
[1:29:54] it was
[1:29:55] you can't just pick this up and sit it
[1:29:58] over here that's not where it fell from
[1:30:00] it fell from here it's got to be put
[1:30:05] back where it goes we'll see that into
[1:30:08] place into the seals that all right a
[1:30:11] couple more quotes and we'll be finished
[1:30:13] sorry too little loan today but that was
[1:30:16] the son of man God made incarnate hey
[1:30:19] man pull that back up again
[1:30:24] the third seal number 12 he is the
[1:30:29] Incarnate God which is the same God made
[1:30:32] incarnate now what is God incarnate
[1:30:34] guarding human flesh right okay now he
[1:30:37] rises from the seat first the
[1:30:39] announcement went forth who is able to
[1:30:40] come and take this book of redemption
[1:30:42] see for the whole plan of redemption
[1:30:43] from Adam from Adam all that Adam lost
[1:30:47] there was nothing lost until Adam and
[1:30:49] after Adam all was lost in the earth and
[1:30:52] everything on the creation of the earth
[1:30:54] was lost and everything fell with Adam
[1:30:57] cross the chasm that no one could get
[1:30:59] back to no way at all man when he sinned
[1:31:02] he left his way left no way back for
[1:31:05] himself and when this question was asked
[1:31:08] John the Revelator the Prophet John was
[1:31:10] in division look saw it there was no man
[1:31:13] in heaven no man earth no man beneath
[1:31:15] the earth nobody even worthy to look at
[1:31:16] the books you know just think of it then
[1:31:18] the lamb comes forward and he takes the
[1:31:20] book now John was asked not to weep any
[1:31:22] more he said Behold the line of Judah
[1:31:24] has prevailed and he can take the book
[1:31:27] and open it so he turned to look for a
[1:31:28] line and he saw a lamb the elder calls
[1:31:32] that a line has prevailed but when he
[1:31:35] come and look
[1:31:36] it was a lamb coming out growing on up
[1:31:40] now
[1:31:42] he'd never noticed that before why he
[1:31:45] had been back there in his doing as me
[1:31:48] tutorial work for he was bleeding for
[1:31:50] the people interceding for the people
[1:31:53] into the last soul that was put on the
[1:31:55] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:31:57] foundation of the world come in there's
[1:31:59] just going to be so many of them there
[1:32:01] and that's it that's all the others
[1:32:03] won't even want to come in they have no
[1:32:05] desire to come in so when that last soul
[1:32:08] has come in then the time of redemption
[1:32:10] is finished then the lamb comes forth to
[1:32:12] claim us rise to what is redeemed and
[1:32:15] that's all creation in the earth and
[1:32:17] everything belongs to him see he has
[1:32:19] redeemed it with his own blood that will
[1:32:21] read it next time you remember brother
[1:32:23] brother Bram talks about Christ getting
[1:32:26] an inheritance the inheritance that he
[1:32:30] inherited he'd give it to his children
[1:32:32] that's what this is amen mm-hmm and
[1:32:36] we'll read it next Sunday when he comes
[1:32:38] forth to take this book to open it while
[1:32:40] my they was John didn't weep anymore and
[1:32:42] he looked and this lamb was a slain lamb
[1:32:45] it had already been killed but it wasn't
[1:32:46] live again now we find out that a slain
[1:32:49] lamb is a bloody lamb bleeding all over
[1:32:52] picture of Calvary and then after he'd
[1:32:55] been slain it raised again and was
[1:32:58] sitting on the throne stayed back in
[1:33:00] behind the throne like this interceding
[1:33:03] for all those souls that would come that
[1:33:05] when the last one was here it was
[1:33:07] completed then God still held the book
[1:33:09] of redemption see he's just doing the
[1:33:11] kinsmen work now so we kind of backed up
[1:33:15] a little bit but look the line it's not
[1:33:17] a Redemption line the line is a judge
[1:33:23] when the mediatorial work is over
[1:33:25] he becomes a judge amen and we'll get to
[1:33:30] that we'll stop right here don't go any
[1:33:32] further than this now look he was
[1:33:36] bleeding for the people interceding
[1:33:40] intercessing for the people until the
[1:33:43] last soul that was put on the Lamb's
[1:33:46] Book of Life before the foundation world
[1:33:48] will come in that's just
[1:33:49] be so many so when that lasso comes in
[1:33:53] then the time of redemption is finished
[1:33:54] the lamb comes forth to take what he's
[1:33:57] redeeming and what is it all of creation
[1:33:59] souls in prison I'm gonna read this and
[1:34:02] real quick number 13 if you want to pull
[1:34:05] it out paragraph 148 John look to see a
[1:34:07] lamb or see a line and what did he find
[1:34:09] a lamb and it was a bloody lamb a lamb
[1:34:11] that had been slain how long since the
[1:34:14] foundation of the world the lamb came
[1:34:17] forth now look the lamb came forth in
[1:34:20] Revelation walked up what walked up to
[1:34:25] him - had the bookends right hand
[1:34:27] receive the book climbed up on the
[1:34:29] throne and sat down now that's not
[1:34:31] anywhere in the Bible but if you put the
[1:34:37] scripture together that he that
[1:34:39] overcometh them sit on my throne as I
[1:34:40] have overcome and set on the Father
[1:34:42] strong if you put those scriptures
[1:34:43] together the prophet knew exactly what
[1:34:45] he was talking about that's what's
[1:34:47] happening people with these seven
[1:34:50] thunders they're not written verbatim in
[1:34:53] the book but they're written from
[1:34:55] Genesis 1 all the way to revelations 20
[1:34:59] the lamb came forth walked up to him
[1:35:02] that the bookends right hand and
[1:35:03] received the book climbed up on the
[1:35:05] throne and sat down that's it it was
[1:35:08] over when when the seals was revealed
[1:35:11] now I wrote myself a little note he said
[1:35:13] oh well then it should that's why
[1:35:15] everybody says Redemption was redemption
[1:35:18] was over in 1963 cuz I said well the
[1:35:21] seals were open sure that was a it was a
[1:35:23] doctrine daddy knows you can't be saved
[1:35:25] after 1963 cuz Redemption was over
[1:35:27] because what the lamb took the book it
[1:35:31] says when the seals was revealed right I
[1:35:33] thought I just read y'all the quote that
[1:35:35] it wasn't revealed back when he preached
[1:35:37] him when the last one that was
[1:35:41] everything that he had redeemed there
[1:35:42] was nothing he come to redeem why didn't
[1:35:45] he redeem them 40 years ago 2,000 years
[1:35:48] ago
[1:35:48] see their names are on the book of life
[1:35:50] in that book he had to stand here
[1:35:53] because it was God's purpose to redeem
[1:35:56] them their names were put on the Lamb's
[1:35:57] Book alive before the foundation of the
[1:35:59] world the lamb was put there with it
[1:36:03] so it's not two books the Lambs not a
[1:36:06] book and we're book it's the same book
[1:36:08] because when brother Brown said there
[1:36:10] stood the book you thought I talking
[1:36:12] about y'all he was telling about Christ
[1:36:14] he was talking about the lamb the book
[1:36:17] was standing there but you and I are
[1:36:19] part of that book the lamb was put there
[1:36:23] with it to be slain here comes the lamb
[1:36:26] when was slain come back to make
[1:36:28] intercession watch him there's a lot of
[1:36:32] impersonation listen there's a lot of
[1:36:34] impersonation Satan can impersonate but
[1:36:38] he cannot redeem me he can't call your
[1:36:42] name and give you eternal life
[1:36:44] so there's only one man right here
[1:36:47] showing us let Stan musicians come only
[1:36:51] one person look I'm not finished let me
[1:36:55] read the rest of this look watch this
[1:36:59] dot all right I just want you stand up
[1:37:02] so you go back to quit going back slate
[1:37:03] I get to sleep he cried so I have to be
[1:37:06] excited a little bit okay there'll be a
[1:37:08] lot of impersonation a lot of everything
[1:37:10] else but there was really somebody was
[1:37:13] gonna be saved for the church was
[1:37:16] predestinated to be without spot or
[1:37:19] wrinkle doesn't that make you worthy if
[1:37:26] you're without spot or wrinkle but look
[1:37:28] we got to realize cross it I'm the one
[1:37:32] that did it and I thought Paul said it
[1:37:37] was Christ in who you the hope of glory
[1:37:43] not Christ in Christ Christ in you the
[1:37:46] hope of glory think Christ in you the
[1:37:49] hope of glory we just have not but we
[1:37:51] haven't got to believe that yet
[1:38:00] we're believing on - we're believing
[1:38:06] because what we can't leave here until
[1:38:08] life's one comes in all right we can't
[1:38:11] leave here - last one comes in all right
[1:38:13] so the last one could be sitting in the
[1:38:16] messy Church I'm not you know I'm not
[1:38:19] physically looking for the last one
[1:38:21] because you know I've seen some people
[1:38:22] come in here I thought oh man it's about
[1:38:24] over with because that person I never
[1:38:25] thought would have come in ya'll said
[1:38:26] the same thing about me about 15 18
[1:38:28] years ago I know that so anyway but then
[1:38:35] you see him leave or you see this one
[1:38:37] drift in you see just in our little
[1:38:39] congregation what about around the world
[1:38:41] oh but there will be like the Prophet
[1:38:43] said there will be somebody that will be
[1:38:47] the last one and when that person comes
[1:38:49] in you better be ready
[1:38:52] you better be already in the book you
[1:38:55] better already be the one that Christ
[1:38:57] talks about because when that door was
[1:39:00] shut they wasn't another person when in
[1:39:02] that are and God shut the door
[1:39:05] no it didn't hey man God shut the door
[1:39:09] I'm sure on the outside there's a bunch
[1:39:12] of little make believer standing at the
[1:39:13] door and all of a sudden when that door
[1:39:15] went heard the preachers the one time
[1:39:18] I'm Erin Ellen who it was the preacher
[1:39:20] said I bet you they because you know it
[1:39:21] was pitched on the inside the outside
[1:39:23] with tar he said I bet you there was
[1:39:25] fingernail marks all up them down that I
[1:39:27] bet there was people trying to get in
[1:39:29] when that water was coming up and you
[1:39:30] know what it was too late they had a
[1:39:32] hundred and twenty years good grief
[1:39:36] God don't give me 120 years you're
[1:39:39] getting close but don't give me 120
[1:39:42] years I'm ready to get out of here but
[1:39:45] when the last one comes in we're gonna
[1:39:47] leave but you know what the last one
[1:39:49] came in that can't come in until they're
[1:39:52] preached - amen
[1:39:59] you love Lord thank God for all things
[1:40:03] but look if he took that book he's
[1:40:05] worthy and what's in the books got to be
