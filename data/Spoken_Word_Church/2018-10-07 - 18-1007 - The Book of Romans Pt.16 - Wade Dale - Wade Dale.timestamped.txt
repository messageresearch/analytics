[1:49] there

[1:56] their venom site and that's why I'm
[1:57] still doing this yeah
[1:59] so don't ever do this or do this because
[2:01] you pumping it right into your body take
[2:04] a credit card or a knife or you can take

[2:20] barbed hook so when he goes into your
[2:22] flesh the barbs stays into your skin and
[2:24] then the bee flies off where you can see

[2:33] hand you hold it like that and even
[2:35] watch it going for a minute it will keep
[2:38] pumping that venom in your body but they
[2:39] don't even bother me anymore I leaned
[2:41] swallow
[2:43] yes that's pretty much kamikaze they're
[2:47] not returning back yeah they are no good
[2:50] anymore
[3:01] one got killed Manuel can I ask you one
[3:06] more question God kill an animal you
[3:11] know what there's good enough for him
[3:12] good enough for me
[3:14] he killed them so and I don't mind eat
[3:20] them we met only mentally we won't eat
[3:23] them over there that's fine but now I'm
[3:25] still in this oh boy and I like the baby
[3:33] right so I mean dark death and I won't
[3:39] tell Emily I'll ask them honestly all
[3:44] that stuff to me is a non-issue I mean
[3:46] in a fatal do they fail to knows and
[3:49] really the games the not didn't careful
[3:51] with myself in time so
[3:54] I think he cares if you got because
[4:00] there is a person there but with an
[4:02] animal less than an animal is just no
[4:04] more that's just a it's not a person so
[4:06] it's something put on this earth for us
[4:08] to use it's the creation of God amen but
[4:11] I could go back
[4:12] he killed the goat I mean he killed the
[4:14] lamb pulled skins off that wasn't too
[4:17] good but that's just the way it is just
[4:23] wind it on this side that's just Lydia
[4:25] you know what this is just a space of
[4:27] time about that big do an eternity move
[4:29] we don't have to wait so I don't worry
[4:32] about here but it mode if you bring too
[4:34] much you make them other stuff for them
[4:36] women just go back it scrolled down to
[4:40] here
[4:44] but you know how you know that you can
[4:47] do this you know all that right you can
[4:50] how I just watching and learning what
[5:01] you're doing okay all right but you'll
[5:04] match that if you'll know if you'll
[5:05] match that you know they won't do it
[5:07] here because you match though it'll
[5:09] highlight that scripture and then you go
[5:11] over to that little plane over there you
[5:14] do all kind of stuff with it you send it
[5:16] out for scripture of the name on your
[5:18] Twitter or Facebook or you can send it
[5:21] as an email you can highlight it yellow
[5:25] if you wish so what that does is that
[5:31] marker that tells me where we stopped
[5:33] and I cut it off Flamengo Hawaii old
[5:35] problem but it was pink yeah the last I
[5:38] know that's where we stopped at and
[5:40] that's where we start our reading so so
[5:42] bookmarks like all right let's say we
[5:49] were talking about hope last time we
[5:51] were talking about adoption to wit the
[5:54] redemption of our body
[5:55] verse 26 likewise the spirit also
[5:58] helpeth our infirmity for we know not
[6:01] what we should pray for as we ought but
[6:05] the Spirit itself makes intercession for
[6:07] us with groanings which cannot be
[6:08] uttered advanced then what that mean how
[6:10] many times him do you felt like brand
[6:12] for somebody didn't have one clue that
[6:15] they were going through the trouble that
[6:16] they were sick or that they've just been
[6:18] a wreck but the spirit did so i sent a
[6:23] message to you they said you need to
[6:25] pray for this person i'm telling you all
[6:28] people i said last night
[6:30] this whole thing is connected to God in
[6:32] human flesh on this earth all judgment
[6:34] is given to man I read in the Bible
[6:38] judgment is not from God himself
[6:41] it will be at the judgment seat it will
[6:44] be judged by with all the people around
[6:46] because remember that's the great thing
[6:48] about this message I'm telling you I
[6:50] know if I'm born again I do not have to
[6:54] stand in that judgment in front of the
[6:57] judgment seat but that I am now
[7:01] transferred to the good
[7:03] not the cute because remember brother
[7:07] Brown said he took your place
[7:09] he stood accused paint the price so that
[7:13] you don't have to ever have to pay it
[7:14] again so if you're born again you've
[7:15] never have to pay that price doesn't
[7:17] matter what happens to you do not have
[7:19] to pay that price
[7:22] brother Brown said you're already judged
[7:24] so if you were already judged
[7:26] I'm just will take what he said but then
[7:29] once that transfer to you've been that
[7:31] transfer have you been the judge because
[7:34] you're the word may flashing the word
[7:36] judge is everything not the word the
[7:38] Bible God's not gonna stand up in today
[7:41] a judgment flip through the 66 books of
[7:43] the Bible and condemn people with it
[7:45] what's he gonna do turn around and say
[7:47] didn't you you you whoever didn't you
[7:50] ride didn't you witness for this guy yes
[7:53] and he turned me down yes
[7:55] who's the judges really I mean that
[7:58] person just herself but it was through
[8:00] you there has to be a righteous in other
[8:04] words there's listen you gotta have a
[8:05] righteous to judge the under object
[8:07] that's right
[8:09] there's no you can't have it will
[8:11] everybody's right well everybody's
[8:13] unrighteous we'll see that's the
[8:14] denominational world is is everybody's
[8:16] unrighteous except for Christ and yeah
[8:19] everybody's gonna have to stand in
[8:20] judgment seat and give an account no not
[8:23] that one the white throne judgment the
[8:25] bride does not stand in that judgment
[8:27] know we do have a judgment we know that
[8:30] because of what Paul said but we do not
[8:32] ever stand before the white throne
[8:33] judgment ever where the judge because
[8:39] I'm going to read you this afternoon we
[8:42] hang a lot on the stone land in
[8:44] Revelation is one this is that's not a
[8:46] man globe
[8:47] gird about the path in right form finish
[8:50] reading the whole thing his feet are
[8:53] like brass brass is
[8:56] always in the bible of judgment or judge
[9:01] brass so what is it it's the bride judge
[9:05] in the world to me that's really just
[9:08] very simple and you know what that don't
[9:11] make us if you think you're gonna walk
[9:13] around this world and go uh-huh
[9:16] so world's gonna be judged by Mabel see
[9:18] there as your there's your attitude
[9:22] which which is wrong so if you don't
[9:26] change it you might be the ones that
[9:28] stand in the funny side up I'll go be
[9:42] Delta but Matt's mindset can't be like
[9:44] on that this Jesus going it gotta be a
[9:47] Newport cuz I'm saying it right now my
[9:49] mom you sit there I know but God if I'm
[9:52] right there if I had to judge be Korea
[9:53] for my daughter for some lot of people I
[9:59] know would I be steady with that and say
[10:02] you know I did testify too but thing is
[10:05] you did wrong to me true my mother said
[10:08] would go back at OPM we'll see that's
[10:12] power without character yes without
[10:15] character satanic you will use it wrong
[10:17] every time so I'm not good I'm not what
[10:21] I want to be okay let's see guys that
[10:25] run turns we encounter brotherly
[10:27] kindness okay but it's you know given
[10:29] you forget it doesn't matter if you kill
[10:31] you
[10:31] no matter who killed your kids you guys
[10:34] will be forgiven
[10:35] whether you do testify to them somebody
[10:39] will and they won't be a person standing
[10:42] at the Y own judgment that hasn't been
[10:44] told something because you can't judge
[10:46] them by that okay if you don't have
[10:49] something given to but I'm judging
[10:55] but - you gotta remember and we'll read
[10:58] this next Sunday because I picked it up
[11:00] last night or this morning if you've
[11:04] done to the least of my little ones
[11:06] you've done under Maine now there's your
[11:09] judgment that's right good all right we
[11:13] always like to go with the good but the
[11:15] man also so the people that done you
[11:17] wrong at the time don't judge me you
[11:19] know that's why the Bible says don't
[11:21] judge them they will be judged that's
[11:23] the hardest thing for us to do is to
[11:25] back off and say okay in other words
[11:28] don't have to say this out loud but you
[11:29] say okay look if you don't change
[11:32] you'll get Church yeah somewhere down
[11:35] the line you'll get yours just let it go
[11:37] that's what problem is though we don't
[11:39] let it go that's our problem that's
[11:40] right we let it fester them we make a
[11:43] case and like they simply make a case
[11:45] against them when it's all their fault
[11:46] okay but a brotherly kindness says we've
[11:51] got in I've been food we've all got to
[11:53] say it's my fault first okay it's my
[11:56] fault further help you gotta say it's my
[11:58] fault first that feed acts like he does
[12:01] yeah you got to know that and now don't
[12:03] open your mouth you got I saw her she
[12:07] was like really yeah
[12:16] the Bible even says no the Bible says
[12:19] one didn't jokes ain't going out with my
[12:22] job but what I'm saying though God slay
[12:24] me
[12:25] yeah yeah I'll trust him not to see that
[12:29] takes it way up here ain't down here
[12:32] that will be up there Dogon slay me get
[12:37] all trust right what what you have a
[12:43] problem with that person
[12:51] yeah does this yes absolutely it does
[12:54] because though God's Way me you gotta
[12:56] you gotta look at that guy and say
[12:58] though that guy
[13:00] slamming slay my family whatever I'll
[13:05] trust God but I can't Harbor that my
[13:08] heart I have to leave that judgment to
[13:10] God right but if I had to take you know
[13:13] but remember knowing that won't be the
[13:15] end of because joint God will judge that
[13:16] person by what he did to you it's all
[13:20] it's all connected
[13:21] yeah it comes from back yeah come into
[13:25] life throne judgment if he killed your
[13:26] whole family okay but did you forgive
[13:29] him but still you forget it he's not ask
[13:33] forgiveness from God if he never asked
[13:35] forgiveness he'll go to the life throne
[13:36] judgment and he'll be judged by what he
[13:38] did you okay alright so leave the
[13:42] judgments and that's why says guys no
[13:44] man
[13:46] that's kinda strange though the policies
[13:48] judge no man and then we're gonna be the
[13:50] judge of the world yeah but you judge no
[13:52] man in that way you're not to judge
[13:55] anybody in that way and that's why the
[13:57] Bible says go pick a brother to court
[13:58] you're not supposed to take a brother
[13:59] and the Lord the car collects man's deep
[14:03] the Bible says I didn't read it like
[14:06] Sonny but it says take the least in your
[14:09] congregation and let them judge you not
[14:12] to preacher and not the Deacons and not
[14:14] the owners it takes us take the least
[14:16] among you let them do the good well
[14:19] that's pretty that's pretty good honey
[14:23] if you got holy hope you feel listen to
[14:25] it he will be the judge okay can we get
[14:27] to our subject
[14:29] all right likewise the spirit also
[14:34] helpeth our infirmities for we know that
[14:36] know not what we should pray for for as
[14:41] we all but the spirit of self makes
[14:43] intercession for us with groanings which
[14:45] cannot be uttered in other words we
[14:48] don't know why don't we pray for
[14:49] so-and-so or why we never had a personal
[14:52] my heart this morning the teeth positive
[14:54] brother clothing this church they could
[14:57] have been in hospital you can hardly
[14:58] wall think you may have gal but when
[15:01] they come on your heart you just press
[15:02] long it's pain no second I wonder what
[15:06] they're doing it's me please people
[15:08] spare the details okay when you come up
[15:11] to be prayed for don't give a 15 minute
[15:13] dissertation the spirit already knows
[15:17] what you up there for Wells don't have
[15:20] to and either searches the hearts
[15:24] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[15:27] hmm because the maintenance intercession
[15:30] for the Saints according to the will of
[15:32] God so he already made an incision force
[15:35] now these things is not like see things
[15:38] like Catholic Church they sold well
[15:40] there says you the Saints are going to
[15:42] make intercession
[15:42] well nothing think talk about that
[15:44] you're aware the sainted ones they know
[15:46] there's no dead Saint right All Saints
[15:52] are alive right okay even the ones it's
[15:55] over in the states dimension they're
[15:57] like if I come back here before their
[16:01] time their Hank right
[16:04] granny always needs a bunch of Hank all
[16:13] right Leslie I'm not gonna expand off
[16:27] because what the Bible can't get off is
[16:29] good thing the Bible says the judgments
[16:31] starts where house of God if man would
[16:40] have took that because man and the olden
[16:44] days took the Bible and wrote laws you
[16:46] can see even though even the wolf jumped
[16:49] some of the junky logs we got in the
[16:50] United States was written from the Old
[16:53] Testament they have a defense cities
[16:56] well yeah we told you you're innocent
[16:59] till proven guilty so we get all that
[17:02] from the Bible but what happened is
[17:03] man's idea like I tell them last night
[17:05] that bug got any ear and I kind of like
[17:11] to echo that's a good analogy could you
[17:13] those bugs eat the tree down well they
[17:15] didn't literally eat a tree that's an
[17:18] analogy or uh or a parallel you can't
[17:26] eat the tree life drilling I've never
[17:29] been eat but the effects of that and
[17:32] what happened the old love died in the
[17:34] air with the bugging out of there the
[17:38] bug got in the air of the people and the
[17:40] preachers started preaching things that
[17:42] was not right and the people just took
[17:43] it and made the doctor go God never made
[17:46] these false coughing coughing no man may
[17:48] stop stop the doctor he - searches the
[17:52] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[17:53] Spirit because he maketh intercession
[17:54] for the Saints according to the will of
[17:55] God and we know it's his whole point to
[17:59] that glass grief because we know that
[18:02] all things work together for good to
[18:04] them that love God to them who are the
[18:08] called according to his purpose
[18:10] alright now let's analyze that for a
[18:12] minute before we get to this part for we
[18:16] know that all things work together for
[18:17] good to them that love God now can we
[18:23] interplay
[18:24] and we know that all things work
[18:26] together for good to them that are born
[18:28] again because a lot of people in this
[18:31] world said why God why did you do this
[18:33] to me or why do you got to do this with
[18:35] me and they're not born again well I
[18:38] tell you one clicking on top okay yes
[18:43] all things work together for good to
[18:45] them that are born again because if you
[18:48] already born again your soul is already
[18:50] eternal how much more do you want to
[18:53] them who are the called not just all the
[18:57] called according to his purpose
[19:00] we all have a purpose in all right but
[19:02] we are be called cause remember men your
[19:04] call you were chosen but now if you
[19:07] recall your him your God that's right
[19:11] because watch this right here for whom
[19:13] he did it for no we talked about this
[19:15] last night he also did predestinate to
[19:18] be conformed to the image of his son his
[19:21] son as one son a man the eternal God in
[19:23] human flesh that he might be the
[19:25] firstborn among many brethren he was but
[19:28] we are because remember we are the
[19:29] church of the firstborn we get when he
[19:31] gets all right so
[19:39] I mean this this just cleared that this
[19:42] one scripture cleared up predestination
[19:43] good and I'm running the people in the
[19:46] message of justice this is
[19:47] predestination now brother Bradley said
[19:53] it's not God putting you in a tube and
[19:59] pulling you through that to you that's
[20:01] right right that's the way most people
[20:04] see predestination
[20:05] I was this seed me and usually someone
[20:11] think I did it I was this here so I'm
[20:13] gonna be this Peter that's true okay
[20:16] that's true if you were in the mind of
[20:19] God see the God the Word of God you
[20:22] always was and you're gonna come you're
[20:26] gonna know all right but that word
[20:32] rights in the walked on the earth this
[20:40] is first this is second this is third
[20:44] okay nobody got that foreknowledge go
[20:51] first
[20:52] he thought of us being bright or not
[20:54] Brian
[20:55] and then issued Ernie because brother
[20:57] Brown said predestination green
[20:59] estimation is pre destiny determined
[21:02] right that's that line of my thanks
[21:04] all right but those who lead for new he
[21:09] put you in this linen man and then what
[21:13] happened was though those who lead for
[21:15] knew he did predestinate one of the
[21:17] pretest I mean destiny determined
[21:19] beforehand words it determined before
[21:21] him we for man's destiny determine
[21:26] before brother Byron said what
[21:28] predestination looks back to for
[21:31] knowledge
[21:31] okay for knowledge looks to destiny this
[21:35] is your life
[21:36] that's right from beginning to end we
[21:39] didn't have bad that would in the mind
[21:40] of God the predestination looks back to
[21:44] for knowledge for knowledge looks to
[21:47] destiny
[21:49] those who he foreknew he did
[21:50] predestinate okay the Bell right with
[21:55] that any question pretty simple those
[21:58] before him he did predestinate all right
[22:01] so then he took take whatever you want
[22:04] to call it the seizure of I to say word
[22:06] word of God always was always will be
[22:09] not a Bible it's not a Bible it's what
[22:17] we have to use to get our point across
[22:18] but it's not a viable it's the word amen
[22:21] in the beginning was the word works with
[22:24] God the Word was God and the Word was
[22:26] made flesh and that's why last night we
[22:30] said we'll be judged by the word well
[22:32] what is a word the word is God in human
[22:34] flesh
[22:35] if it's just the word land on pages this
[22:37] day it's right
[22:38] this is data that does no good and
[22:41] really going into somebody in it right
[22:43] that does know that it there's meeting
[22:46] there we have some Bibles come in the
[22:48] post office Gideon Bible then with a
[22:50] stack of cases of Gideon Bible that high
[22:54] good idea good job put them in the motel
[22:57] but you know what if somebody don't pick
[22:59] that thing up it'll just burn with the
[23:01] rest of the world but it's the Word of
[23:04] God amen
[23:05] it's the letter that God wrote
[23:09] [Music]
[23:18] that person
[23:22] [Music]
[23:23] yes
[23:26] but now you gotta remember by
[23:29] foreknowledge I'm saying this is the
[23:32] eternal okay this is not this is
[23:35] somebody else this is the center okay he
[23:38] wanted him to work so he's not here
[23:41] that's why brother round made that
[23:42] analogy with the priest he drew the
[23:45] circles and he went like this he said
[23:50] that's no words
[23:52] that's the predestinated the woman at
[23:56] the well if you want to say well they're
[23:58] big but when he drilled the other bad
[24:05] drawing let's think people that took all
[24:06] my stuff but what happens is is what
[24:09] brother branham said God looks at the
[24:12] Pharisees and he's one blacked out
[24:16] why because of he knew what they would
[24:21] choose oh right you knew what they would
[24:27] choose predestination to me honestly
[24:29] people want the simplest doctrine ever
[24:33] to come out of them on the gun stand
[24:36] list in the world
[24:37] and it explains a lot because you take
[24:42] my brother Dale said last night you
[24:43] think these people said you said this
[24:45] Steve doctor you always want your firm I
[24:47] agree that if you say the word is the
[24:50] seed okay okay but I want to ask you a
[24:54] question we're going to read it this
[24:55] afternoon if somebody shows that see
[25:01] Matthew
[25:04] the son of man is the solar God in human
[25:09] flesh is the solar of the state that's
[25:14] exactly it
[25:17] so those he foreknew he did predestinate
[25:20] he saw your journey all the way from
[25:23] beginning to end therefore he could have
[25:25] the word ready for you yes you come
[25:28] right down this line and it's not God
[25:30] pulling you good cube actually sure
[25:31] choice that's right it's your choice to
[25:34] be right here you either can be here air
[25:36] is your choice but he foreknew before
[25:40] the world who wouldn't who wouldn't
[25:41] brother mountain cover that the would
[25:43] and who would not it's bad but he give
[25:46] him a chance
[25:46] yes Judas he knew you'd us a chance to
[25:49] be a part of this gave him every
[25:52] opportunity in the world to be a part of
[25:53] this and he what he rejected it right
[25:56] all right yeah
[25:57] so those he foreknew he did predestinate
[26:00] that's why I'm telling you the reason
[26:02] God wrote this word was because he saw
[26:04] what part we would need when we got here
[26:06] amen
[26:07] there's your seed to stay everybody
[26:11] wants to make it some little permanent
[26:13] or some little wiggle tail something the
[26:17] Bible up we read in the sacrament the
[26:19] parable of the sower the Solars the son
[26:23] of man the seed is the one word when I
[26:29] hear brother man talk about seed I do
[26:30] not my brain now does not go to a
[26:34] literal little dot when I hear him talk
[26:41] about the seed I go straight to the word
[26:43] of going straight to the word side and
[26:47] it's the Word made flesh not just words
[26:51] debate so that's the main predestination
[26:54] is just so something because remember
[26:57] without without the
[27:01] where's my poop are you sure
[27:06] Luis got interpreting today so he's
[27:08] gotta go
[27:09] but look without the will now brother
[27:11] Brown but remember even without brother
[27:14] ground this was always in the Bible
[27:16] right this is always in the scripture
[27:19] for whom he did foreknow we can read
[27:21] that that's very reading a plain English
[27:24] King's English actually thank you
[27:27] but now most people this is
[27:30] predestination
[27:40] no this other stuff not yet though to
[27:49] the cornea so what comes first for
[27:52] college
[27:53] those who he foreknew he did
[27:56] predestinate execute pre-determined your
[28:00] destination he predetermined your
[28:02] destination not by his design because
[28:05] all Symbian people in this world if God
[28:07] desired it would become the word and
[28:10] would go right down through here and
[28:11] then but you know what that would be so
[28:15] like a robot that's right that would be
[28:18] so inhuman that would be a robot you'd
[28:20] be like okay I'm gonna live in my
[28:22] seventy year and then I'm going to
[28:25] heaven you know no these still give
[28:28] those toys we got choices in here that's
[28:31] my grill that squiggly line we still
[28:33] make choices because we got this thing
[28:48] that's great yep that's what I've been
[28:50] saying T yes so it is your choice
[28:55] everybody's got a choice oh then guess
[28:58] what if we chose this part we go we know
[29:02] those a lot on just because we're
[29:04] covered in him but this for dollars in
[29:08] predestination judges these people over
[29:10] here even though listen it's like I said
[29:14] before think about when Jesus came out
[29:17] of the grave
[29:19] all power telling them has been given
[29:21] unto me why didn't he just have to devil
[29:23] get rid of all the demons kill only he
[29:25] can do that why don't you just kill it
[29:28] off and say okay alright Brian come out
[29:31] come out
[29:33] No you don't call your kids into the
[29:37] existence either do you you have to go
[29:39] to a birth process you have to go
[29:42] through a conception process right so
[29:46] that's the same way with God he runs in
[29:49] company he couldn't just all the sudden
[29:51] walk up and go well we're going to go
[29:53] away when I meet him how when you test
[29:54] them up we're just going to have all my
[29:55] people here all my kids devil go no you
[29:58] do that because when he said that we're
[30:02] going to get to that when he said all
[30:04] power in heaven Earth's been given unto
[30:05] me that's where we were we weren't in
[30:09] that man that was the Sun man and it's
[30:13] the son of man to come back in the end
[30:14] time we gotta say the same thing he says
[30:17] yes man
[30:18] all power never nervous been given unto
[30:20] me cuz when your body's changed you can
[30:23] say that you can say all Bernard enters
[30:26] me give another because there's no
[30:27] dimension can hold you there's no devil
[30:29] can hold you deaths been destroyed daddy
[30:32] you got no sorrow no pain no agony hey
[30:35] when you get a body change come on all
[30:37] power net winner has been given of you
[30:39] we're working toward it we're getting
[30:41] that for whom he did foreknow he also
[30:46] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[30:48] image of the son that he might be the
[30:51] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[30:55] whom he did predestinate according to
[30:58] foreknowledge those who he did
[30:59] predestinate he called and you answer
[31:06] he called in us remove meaning of called
[31:10] for your chosen why the one chosen by
[31:12] the election like what a preacher said
[31:15] one time election that's what the voting
[31:17] god voted for you at the devil voted
[31:20] against you you swing the vote right
[31:23] either to the one this way or to the one
[31:26] this way you swing that's why it's
[31:27] called election you're the leg why
[31:31] because you chose God over the devil
[31:33] that's very simple thing moreover whom
[31:37] he did predestinate them he also called
[31:38] and whom he called them he also
[31:41] justified and whom he justified them he
[31:46] also glorified so if God justifies you
[31:50] that means you're going to continue on
[31:51] the glorification Amen you man so that's
[31:55] a really good promise thing what shall
[32:00] we then Paul let's let's give a
[32:04] summation of all this I just talked
[32:06] about it gotta be forced to be
[32:09] consistent you know call it darlin
[32:11] justified he didn't he will suggest the
[32:14] power and of the justified and he also
[32:18] glorified us we can't morph ourselves
[32:20] with fame then what can we say to this
[32:22] whole thing if God be for us who's gonna
[32:25] be against right he that spared not his
[32:28] own son but delivered him up for us all
[32:30] how shall he not with him also freely
[32:34] give us all things in other words
[32:35] through Christ this is that this is that
[32:38] summation of Romans
[32:51] Oh No
[32:55] where the worth is waiting for join ater
[33:04] 17 if children then heirs heirs of God
[33:06] going enterprise
[33:07] now Paul speaking that same thought of
[33:09] down here in this verse we're talking
[33:10] about those fewer heirs of God and
[33:12] joint-heirs with Christ how shall he not
[33:19] with him with his son I'll feel free to
[33:22] give us all things
[33:24] give us all Fame all right who shall lay
[33:27] anything because what now listen there
[33:32] are natural judges on this earth that
[33:34] have done things wrong that will
[33:37] probably that will have to be judged for
[33:39] and we see now that they've done you
[33:41] know they do all kind of stuff but
[33:42] that's human my stuff we're talking
[33:44] about Donald Mac mm-hmm God Almighty who
[33:51] shall lay anything to the charge of God
[33:53] alone that's not what it says what does
[33:58] he just transferred it to you is he led
[34:01] so then we should not have a problem
[34:03] with it's gonna be the judge there's
[34:06] your answer
[34:07] who shall easy think us remember that's
[34:10] the glorious thing about this whole part
[34:12] now I want to make this complaint and
[34:15] and
[34:20] there's things we've done in our life
[34:22] that was wrong yes the man and we may
[34:27] have done with somebody else in our
[34:30] younger life and the things that we did
[34:31] we may have done with somebody else but
[34:33] do you know what if you've been forgiven
[34:35] of that is that person that forgot it
[34:38] but God had you'd already forgotten hey
[34:41] so who can lay anything to the charge of
[34:46] God's elect folks our charts card is
[34:51] empty we have zero it's May
[34:54] but now when that person walks up the
[34:57] white throne he may still have her she
[34:59] may have in their mind what's he doing
[35:02] up there
[35:02] what's she doing up there right but you
[35:06] got away back home what God say and then
[35:08] God said he played to see it forgive
[35:10] them that's never to come even
[35:11] remembered again now he said never be
[35:13] remembered that's what I said
[35:16] if we're standing out here back here
[35:19] judging they can't think we can't have
[35:24] or you gonna have to stand up thank ya
[35:27] who can lay any charge the god of the
[35:30] land you know millions that way another
[35:33] billion that way there's still zero
[35:35] there's no account charge P that's what
[35:38] we're going to say I believe I hope when
[35:40] we come to the change of the body but my
[35:41] problem with changing the body is is we
[35:44] make a list of things we do we talk too
[35:47] much we don't do this within this
[35:49] without praying I would not read the
[35:50] Bible we don't
[35:51] lettuce and something I call a laundry
[35:53] list when I want that this thing and
[36:01] look he don't make a lid it's already
[36:09] been in the Bible it's already been here
[36:11] forever so it's just something we're
[36:13] trying to believe okay he experienced
[36:17] own son but delivered him up for us all
[36:19] how shall he not with him also freely
[36:21] give us all things who show away my
[36:24] sequence in nature who shall bring a
[36:27] charge against what God's elect it is
[36:33] done then justified so guess what
[36:37] declares righteous he has declared you
[36:41] righteous today right okay he has
[36:45] declared you righteous who shall lay
[36:48] anything to the charge of God's Lake it
[36:50] is God than justified who is he that
[36:52] condemneth it is Christ that died a
[36:55] rhythm that is risen again wouldn't a
[36:57] matter that God died Christ died it
[37:01] steady rose hey hey steady roads alright
[37:05] because many people died saying they
[37:07] were Christ then write a memo conflict
[37:09] said all that one took 400 our wolf out
[37:11] in the wilderness we heard another thing
[37:13] from a big city with cry all these are
[37:15] false prophets and false Christ Christ
[37:18] it died again rather that is risen again
[37:20] who is even at the right hand of God who
[37:22] also maketh intercession for us what the
[37:26] little things we did and he's not
[37:28] interceding for our soul hmm no he
[37:33] doesn't know that well actually that is
[37:34] the salt God's been in me that is part
[37:37] of you same thing
[37:38] it's the intercession for the little
[37:40] - as you were climbing up the stanchion
[37:42] perfectly well I think at that moment
[37:56] the person whoever that is is going to
[37:58] be standing there is really not gonna be
[38:00] to me that's just an analogy okay
[38:02] they're not gonna really be standing
[38:04] there looking through the crowd trying
[38:05] to find somebody they committed adultery
[38:06] or committed to the sir
[38:08] well he's total bank with me like no
[38:11] they're gonna they're gonna realize but
[38:14] that if somebody's standing up later and
[38:18] somebody's standing here and they have a
[38:21] lot roads and they're standing in there
[38:23] and young bodies and this person
[38:24] standing here and the body that he said
[38:26] then and and been in a place where
[38:29] really what nice for the lifestyles
[38:30] makers give them one thing he's not
[38:33] gonna be up there like Dave said he's
[38:34] not going to be the argumentative people
[38:36] that's going to come to the white throne
[38:38] brother religiously not to sin okay
[38:41] not the same don't really in just people
[38:46] that was that was my anniversary present
[38:48] the June that's all the we can say so
[38:50] yesterday was our 39th anniversary I
[38:57] tell him it's the same woman she said
[38:59] it's not all right let's go you know
[39:10] what people think
[39:11] they're thinking and I'm crying god
[39:15] you're talking about all of it or about
[39:18] it or or we didn't know that no no
[39:21] actually human right a new game
