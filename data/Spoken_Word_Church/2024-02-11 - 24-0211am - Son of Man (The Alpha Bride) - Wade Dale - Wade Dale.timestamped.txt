[0:06] the back we're going to read Psalm 86
[0:09] and not

[0:16] had a little
[0:19] friend that is 3 years
[0:28] old
[0:41] well I'll tell you later what I if I can
[0:45] if I can't tell you but uh I got a phone
[0:49] call from him yesterday morning from his
[0:53] mother and he had got out of
[0:56] bed and got his brother's gun
[1:07] he sh can't kill
[1:18] us I thought I
[1:22] could tell you
[1:27] this
[1:28] peacefully
[1:30] but he he
[1:34] was
[1:37] hard that he
[1:39] always he did he did a lots of hard
[1:42] things that I had to be a little angry
[1:45] with him at times but most time I go to
[1:48] his house he would come and take my hat
[1:52] and came and put her at a certain place
[1:55] and said now sit
[1:58] down but
[2:01] uh you know you do things and everybody
[2:06] will blame his L your brother for
[2:09] leaving away and get hands on it but
[2:12] that's not the way it is I told said
[2:13] well you know I feel this way about it
[2:17] he is in a better place than he was here
[2:21] yes with his parents that didn't take
[2:23] proper care and raising him and uh you
[2:27] know there's
[2:28] nothing that you can you can do or
[2:31] nothing we can do
[2:34] but just be thankful that God give us
[2:38] the chance to do it and it it's it's a
[2:41] matter that we need to know how we're
[2:43] raising our children and RA in peaceful
[2:47] way the older brothers that had the gun
[2:52] they did things they're not supposed to
[2:55] do his mother's grandmothers none of
[2:58] them really truly live falling God you
[3:02] know they go to church sometime when
[3:04] they feel like it but they don't follow
[3:07] God every day you know it's an everyday
[3:10] thing with raising children and raising
[3:13] ourselves so we must have to just keep
[3:17] it playing keep it going forward I
[3:20] wanted to give this to brother Ryan let
[3:23] him read it because I didn't know that I
[3:25] would be able to do it

[3:31] still will be a friend and I hope that I
[3:36] can get my life make sure my life is
[3:38] right that when I leave this earth we
[3:41] can sit down together

[8:47] gracious longsuffering plenteous and
[8:49] mercy and Truth do you believe he's that
[8:53] have God is in you are you
[8:55] that we have to be that we have to
[8:58] surrender to be that mercy and Truth to
[9:00] one another and uh brother colie he
[9:03] reminded me of many stories of things
[9:06] you know you don't understand why uh
[9:08] events happen like that um we live in a
[9:12] age of mental health where spirits and
[9:15] things attack the mind and it's
[9:17] important to take time if you feel led
[9:19] to talk to another person just how are
[9:22] you feeling you know sometimes the
[9:24] default answer is I'm good I'm great how
[9:26] are you really feeling you know let's
[9:28] let's see what's going on in your life
[9:30] cuz we we are supposed to be God to each
[9:32] other with flesh and to take time to be
[9:36] patient one with another and you know
[9:38] hey there's times where I don't know
[9:40] about you but there's times where I
[9:42] don't want to live sometimes you know
[9:44] and the Devil comes in with those
[9:45] thoughts and just you're not worth
[9:47] nothing you know um and not to take too
[9:50] much time or be out of order I saw this
[9:52] clip one time it showed two men in their
[9:55] lives and they were friends and they
[9:57] would go to like a soccer game together
[9:59] together and one just wasn't very almost
[10:02] like he was kind of depressed and the
[10:03] other one was just up and cheering was
[10:05] active and just bubbly all the time and
[10:08] it continued on like that and then it
[10:10] went back to the game and the one that
[10:13] seemed kind of depressed sometime had a
[10:15] shirt he put in an empty chair his
[10:18] friend took his own life he was dealing
[10:21] with depression and things and but
[10:23] externally you didn't see that right you
[10:25] didn't see it
[10:27] so we we we fight Spirits we we fight
[10:30] things in the Unseen uh but we can also
[10:34] let the Lord use our words to sit down
[10:37] and and get things out and just talk
[10:39] things through and say I'm here for you
[10:41] let's pray together let's walk through
[10:42] this together and that's God using you
[10:45] in your life and it's important to do
[10:47] that amen so uh brother Michael would
[10:50] you come this morning and
[10:53] uh the tiing
[10:58] offering pray you yes consolation to
[11:01] thees Lord Min to

[21:06] he was a Methodist Minister also so just
[21:08] remember that and prayer so all minds
[21:10] and hearts clear today we're going to
[21:12] talk about the alpha bride which the
[21:13] alpha bride is what that's the one that
[21:15] started on day of Pentecost all right
[21:18] we're the Omega bride where the book
[21:20] ends but we're supposed to be just like
[21:23] they are remember the last age gets all
[21:26] the blessings and all the curs es of all
[21:29] the other ages they pile up right here
[21:31] on us so every blessing they get what
[21:34] God hated there he hates here what God
[21:37] loves there he loves here amen then
[21:40] we'll look at that and I also want you
[21:41] to if you want to um if you got a little
[21:44] time I appreciate what brother Bob had
[21:45] to say today we really all need to be
[21:47] more fervent in what we do and move on
[21:50] with God and uh and put him first in
[21:53] everything and and not everything else
[21:55] but um but look at the look at this
[21:58] Church look at the city of Ephesus we
[22:00] were talking about this a little bit the
[22:01] other
[22:02] day the city of Ephesus almost mirrors
[22:05] the city of leosa so we're going to talk
[22:08] about that maybe next Sunday or Sunday
[22:10] after when we speak against brother
[22:12] Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday
[22:14] remember the banquet this coming weekend
[22:16] just pray for brother collie and his the
[22:18] family there that uh tragedy
[22:20] there um his friend so let's just go to
[22:24] the Lord in pray Lord thank you for the
[22:27] Bride of Jesus
[22:28] Christ for the word that you give us and
[22:31] that we become that word the word has
[22:32] become flesh and a group of people
[22:36] father I pray now that you would take
[22:38] the isav of the Holy Spirit as you were
[22:40] there in the last Church age you said by
[22:43] of me these things and use the isav
[22:45] because Lord sometimes uh truly as
[22:48] brother Bob say sometimes the world
[22:49] blinds us to the things that we need but
[22:52] father you said You' give us eyes have
[22:54] that would we could see Lord what you
[22:56] are giving us in the end time lord it's
[22:59] become a late hour it's time to get out
[23:01] of here things are not going to get
[23:03] better in the world they're just going
[23:04] to get worse but Lord if if we have a
[23:07] pavilion that we can run into and Lord
[23:10] we do you gave us that you gave us the
[23:12] Holy Ghost and you gave us as the
[23:14] prophet said we are now in the layout of
[23:16] c and age we are pressurized for what's
[23:18] coming we know we're astronauts we don't
[23:21] live here we have a whole different
[23:23] mindset Lord and I pray that you just
[23:25] break this word down to each one of us
[23:27] today heal the sick raise the dead Lord
[23:30] bless each one that's not here that's
[23:31] sick Lord sister Joyce and brother Danny
[23:34] different ones Lord I pray that you'd be
[23:36] with them Father bless us Lord in Jesus
[23:39] name amen so we're going to talk about
[23:42] today the alpha bride so we're going to
[23:43] look at the Ephesian church not the
[23:45] Ephesian Church the Ephesian bride all
[23:48] right because there is an Ephesian
[23:49] Church everybody with me we went through
[23:51] all these Services about the difference
[23:53] in a church and a bride all right the
[23:55] bride's the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[23:57] church is there everything else all
[23:59] right and they don't all go to
[24:01] heaven don't get silent they don't all
[24:04] go to heaven but all the bride does so
[24:07] if you insert yourself over here you're
[24:09] good all right Revelations 1:10 says I
[24:12] was in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[24:13] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[24:15] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega you
[24:17] know those two words Alpha is the first
[24:19] letter in the Greek alphabet Omega is
[24:22] the last A and Z the first and the last
[24:25] what thou seest right in a book and send
[24:27] it into the seven churches which are in
[24:29] Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus saara
[24:32] Sardis Philadelphia and lead and I
[24:36] turned to see the voice that spoke with
[24:37] me and I being turned I saw seven golden
[24:39] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[24:41] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[24:43] of man clothed with a garment down to
[24:45] the foot and G about to paps with a
[24:47] golden girdle his head and his hair was
[24:49] white like wool white as snow and his
[24:52] eyes were as flames of fire and his feet
[24:54] like in Define brass if they burned in a
[24:56] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[24:58] many Waters and he had in his right hand
[25:01] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[25:03] sharp two-edged sword and his
[25:04] countenance was as the sun shineth in it
[25:07] strength you may be seated we we covered
[25:09] those seven uh uh different um
[25:13] attributes of God there in the uh last
[25:16] couple of sermons but we see that he was
[25:18] in the midst he he was in the midst had
[25:20] two things in his hand he had the church
[25:22] and he had the the the the messengers
[25:24] all right so he had everything there he
[25:26] listen regardless of mankind and the
[25:29] devil God's going to have a church a
[25:32] bride God's going to have a bride
[25:34] doesn't matter you you can sit here and
[25:35] you can fold your arms and you can go to
[25:37] sleep like Bob said but you're not going
[25:39] to stop the program of God don't think
[25:42] your one little self is going to stop
[25:43] the program of God no you can hinder it
[25:46] though and then you if You Hinder it you
[25:48] going to be held responsible for
[25:51] it not God you are and we looked at the
[25:55] prism so we got one God
[25:58] one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ not a
[26:00] trinit Doctrine a
[26:02] Triune revelation of God that he is all
[26:06] these things but he's one person all
[26:07] right but we see the prism and if you
[26:09] put that light through the prism it runs
[26:11] seven different colors well those seven
[26:13] different colors or the seven Church
[26:15] ages because the seven Church ages is a
[26:17] complete and final revelation of Jesus
[26:19] Christ in his bride that's what he
[26:22] decided not us all right he decided he's
[26:25] going to showcase his
[26:28] best and you're not going to stop it and
[26:30] I'm not going to stop it he will
[26:32] showcase his best he has a masterpiece
[26:35] and he will put her on display he's put
[26:38] her on display in part from from one
[26:40] Church age to this one but today in this
[26:43] church age he is going to show the
[26:44] fullness because we're to be the
[26:46] fullness of the godhead bodily in the
[26:48] end time in a
[26:50] bride everybody with me we'll talk a
[26:52] little bit this afternoon about the
[26:53] father's Throne because it's it's
[26:56] different than Jesus's throne
[27:00] am well those of you that know said amen
[27:02] those of you didn't you'll know this
[27:03] afternoon if you'll come
[27:05] back but there's a difference cuz he sat
[27:08] on he say sit with me in my Throne as I
[27:10] set in my father's Throne so there's
[27:11] it's not two or three different Thrones
[27:12] in three or four different people it's
[27:14] one person in a different manifestation
[27:16] we know that right all right so John
[27:18] 1:14 is a promise this word is going to
[27:21] be made flesh and dwelt Among Us it is
[27:24] going to be your flesh and my flesh all
[27:27] right
[27:28] and this is a start of a new
[27:29] dispensation this is something so new
[27:32] that what happened and right it's a
[27:34] transition between John the Baptist and
[27:37] then Jesus comes on the scene and then
[27:39] Jesus leaves and the disciples take the
[27:41] full word of God the religious World
[27:43] hated
[27:45] them didn't love them didn't didn't
[27:47] didn't not with open arms no no no they
[27:50] hated the true word of God Amen and
[27:53] we'll look later on I mean they cut
[27:55] Paul's head off they killed every
[27:58] disciple except John John was the only
[28:01] one John the Revelator was the only one
[28:03] he was and Jesus said he's one that's
[28:05] going to write all these he told him
[28:06] when he was still alive but John was a
[28:08] young baby of the bunch and in ad90
[28:10] something he became the pastor of the
[28:12] Ephesian church and we'll read that a
[28:14] little bit later on when we get into
[28:15] Ephesus because Ephesus was a religious
[28:19] Center like now a religious Center that
[28:23] a lot of people came to Mary was there
[28:25] John James different ones di in that
[28:28] City and um John was a pastor of the
[28:30] church there but this new dispensation
[28:33] was so new that Satan knew there was
[28:35] something coming but he couldn't stop it
[28:38] but he sure tried cuz he killed them all
[28:39] he killed everybody he killed he killed
[28:42] Paul before his
[28:44] time I mean ad50 something is when the
[28:47] church age started and ad60 something is
[28:49] when they cut Paul's head off right at
[28:51] the first of that age but what happened
[28:53] was God knew that there'd be a group of
[28:56] people right group of people that would
[28:59] carry this message on to the coming of
[29:00] the Lord or to the end of that church
[29:03] age that they were in but remember God
[29:05] never raises that man back
[29:08] up he's finished with him I'm sorry he's
[29:11] finished with him everybody Moses amen
[29:14] didn't bring bring didn't bring brought
[29:16] Moses back up Joshua took over all right
[29:19] right David got too much blood on your
[29:21] hands but I'm going to have a temple
[29:23] Solomon's going to build this Temple for
[29:25] me so David laid away
[29:28] and then the same thing Paul Paul laid
[29:30] away iren it's different ones and even
[29:32] brother brandham laid
[29:35] away laid away so that the bride could
[29:40] mature to his
[29:42] message the bride in the first age
[29:45] matured to Paul's message they took
[29:48] Paul's message and become a mature
[29:50] Church like Ephesus and different ones
[29:51] but we'll get to that so Hebrews 10 says
[29:54] look by a New and Living Way so it's
[29:56] going to be something new so even that
[29:58] if it was new then now Alpha if it was
[30:00] new then it's going to be new now
[30:03] because remember they had just come out
[30:05] of the manifestation of the son of man
[30:08] he was on Earth himself literally
[30:11] speaking to the people right God in
[30:14] flesh amen well he can't come back
[30:19] though in that flesh while we're here or
[30:22] you got two bodies that's why you can't
[30:24] have two heads that's why everything's
[30:25] got to be done correctly but over here
[30:28] in the end time what's the same thing
[30:30] the son of man is to be revealed and not
[30:32] through one person though through a
[30:33] bride but there had to be a spokesman
[30:36] come on the scene to tell us you can
[30:38] make it you're astronauts now you're not
[30:42] the right
[30:43] Brothers if you were to raise the right
[30:45] Brothers up now and say hey that's what
[30:48] when y'all went to Kitty Hawk and you
[30:49] were like 200 feet off or 100 feet off
[30:51] the ground for 15 or 20 yards or or
[30:53] however how many 100 yards it was and
[30:55] you landed look what we're doing now
[30:59] we're running 1500 M an hour and we're
[31:01] going to space now we're coming back
[31:04] started with the right Brothers started
[31:06] in the first church
[31:09] age God's moving on folks God's moving
[31:12] on whether we want him to or not we're
[31:14] we got to get in the program but a New
[31:16] and Living Way so it's got to be not
[31:18] just dead letter it's got to be a new
[31:21] living way which started on the day of
[31:24] Pentecost that's where the alpha bride
[31:25] started was on the day of Pentecost is
[31:27] everybody with me all right but there
[31:30] had to be a new testament or a New
[31:32] Covenant or a new will the old one was
[31:35] do and don'ts do this don't do that I
[31:38] haven't touched no girl I haven't
[31:40] committed adultery Jesus said I say unto
[31:43] you if you even look on
[31:45] her and lust after her you've committed
[31:48] he didn't do away with the Commandment
[31:49] he magnified the commandment and said
[31:51] hey it's not the touching part it's what
[31:53] you think in your mind all right
[31:56] everybody with me amen so now we're
[31:58] looking at a New Testament Jesus said in
[32:00] First Corinthians this is my body which
[32:02] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[32:03] of me this is the communion scripture
[32:05] after the same manner also he took the
[32:07] cup and when he up saying this cup is
[32:09] the New Testament in my blood the Old
[32:11] Testament was blood of bulls and goats
[32:13] the Old Testament was lambs and doves
[32:15] and and all that but that that Soul
[32:18] which an animal don't have a soul but
[32:20] that Spirit of that animal couldn't come
[32:22] into you that's right but Jesus Christ
[32:25] could CU he was the soul of God and he
[32:28] could disperse himself in many ways just
[32:30] like he did on the day of Pentecost this
[32:32] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[32:34] this D you of as you drink it in
[32:36] remembrance of me that's why we take
[32:38] communion to remember the Lord all right
[32:41] Hebrews 9:11 says but Christ being a
[32:43] high priest of good things to come by a
[32:44] greater more perfect Tabernacle not made
[32:47] with hands that is to say not of this
[32:48] building because what was the Old
[32:50] Testament and confence was in it Jesus
[32:53] was in the Old
[32:55] Testament come on Jesus was in the Old
[32:59] Testament the New Testament don't start
[33:01] till the book of
[33:02] Acts he just said it right here this was
[33:05] when he was dying going to the cross and
[33:08] then then at Penta 50 days later he came
[33:11] back on the day of Pentecost all right
[33:13] but he's telling he told them they said
[33:16] uh well destroy this Temple and I'll
[33:17] raise it up in three days and you know
[33:18] confusing them the the the legalist of
[33:21] the bunch we 40 something years building
[33:23] that Temple I the world he going to
[33:25] knock it down in three days he wasn't
[33:27] talking about that he was talking about
[33:28] this yes talking about the Temple of his
[33:30] body he says not of this building
[33:32] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[33:34] but by his own blood he entered in once
[33:36] to the holy place he didn't have to go
[33:38] back every year you don't have to go
[33:39] back every year amen to get the Holy
[33:43] Ghost having obtained Eternal Redemption
[33:46] for me and you that's Body Spirit and
[33:48] soul all right for if the blood of bulls
[33:51] and goats and Ashes of heer sprinkled
[33:52] the unclean if that was if that worked
[33:55] we should stayed under it under it
[33:57] amen but it didn't work it didn't work
[34:00] the way the New Testament wanted it to
[34:03] work God didn't want us to just live
[34:05] like the devil for 364 days and then on
[34:07] the day of atonement he goes and makes
[34:09] an atonement one priest does and then we
[34:11] go back out live the way we want to
[34:13] that's not what he wanted he wanted us
[34:14] to live a Sanctified life 24/7 the best
[34:17] we can all right I said the best we can
[34:21] cuz I Don't Preach sinless Perfection we
[34:23] all have flaws and we all have things we
[34:25] have to work on all right well you don't
[34:27] pray for me how much more shall the
[34:30] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[34:32] spirit see there was no eternal spirit
[34:34] that could come into a believer in the
[34:35] Old Testament all right only in the New
[34:38] Testament everybody with me the eternal
[34:41] spirit offered himself without Spa to
[34:43] God Purge your conscience from dead
[34:44] words to serve the Living God he's
[34:45] asking a question and for this cause he
[34:48] is the mediator of the New Testament
[34:51] that by means of death for the
[34:52] Redemption of the transgression that
[34:53] were under the first testament they
[34:55] which are called might receive the the
[34:57] promise of Eternal inheritance nobody in
[34:59] the Old Testament got an eternal
[35:02] inheritance oh yeah they're going to
[35:04] receive things amen they're going to
[35:06] receive things but they didn't have that
[35:09] Eternal you got your Eternal inheritance
[35:11] right here today sent with you if you're
[35:12] born again
[35:14] amen they which call might receive the
[35:16] promise of Eternal inheritance for where
[35:18] a testament is or a will or a covenant
[35:21] is there must also of necessity be the
[35:23] death of the testator like I said before
[35:26] uh you don't go to a will reading while
[35:28] and the guy that wrote the whe sitting
[35:30] in the room with
[35:32] you right he's got to be passed on he's
[35:35] got to have left you
[35:38] something he left us
[35:41] something he left us the well in the
[35:43] spirit to what to live the
[35:48] well for a testament is a force after
[35:51] men are dead otherwise it is of no
[35:54] strength at all while the testator
[35:56] liveth in other words Jesus stood there
[35:58] for three and a half years and preached
[35:59] the perfect he was the perfect
[36:03] example nobody believed him nobody there
[36:07] wasn't one person saved except the thief
[36:08] on the cross there wasn't one person
[36:10] saved in his ministry time they didn't
[36:12] understand him but it wasn't for them it
[36:14] was for
[36:17] us second Corinthians 3 says Do We Begin
[36:19] Again to commend ourselves or need we as
[36:21] some others Epistles of accommodation to
[36:23] you or letters of accommodation from you
[36:25] you are our epistle
[36:27] written in our hearts known and read of
[36:30] all men for as much as you are
[36:33] manifestly declared by the Epistle of
[36:34] Christ ministered by us so it's got to
[36:37] be ministered by a
[36:39] person amen written not with
[36:42] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[36:45] God you know they didn't have many
[36:47] scribes they had scribes but they didn't
[36:48] have many people that had tape recorders
[36:50] in Paul's
[36:54] day they had to remember what Paul
[36:58] said and be
[37:00] awake well look that one guy Paul
[37:03] preached a long guy died right he fell
[37:06] out of he fell he fell out of a window
[37:09] but Paul said well that's my fault I'm
[37:11] going to go down there and pray for him
[37:12] and he raised him from the dead all
[37:13] right
[37:15] so okay anyway not going any further
[37:17] with that written not with ink we'll
[37:20] pray for you if you fall out okay but
[37:22] with the spirit of the Living God not in
[37:24] tables of stone but in F fleshly
[37:27] tables of the heart and such trust we
[37:30] have through Christ to godward not that
[37:32] we are sufficient of ourselves or think
[37:34] anything of ourselves but our
[37:36] sufficiency is of God I hope you have
[37:39] that on your refrigerator our
[37:41] sufficiency is of God all right who also
[37:44] hath made us oh he's transferred
[37:47] something into
[37:48] well he made us able Ministers of the
[37:52] New Testament not of the letter but of
[37:54] the spirit for the letter kth but the
[37:57] Spirit giveth Life we'll see in just a
[37:59] few minutes how that affected the first
[38:01] church age and even affected the first
[38:03] bride all right so now let's skip on
[38:07] through for if the ministration of
[38:08] condemnation be glory much more do the
[38:10] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[38:13] glory all right in other words we got
[38:15] grace and
[38:17] mercy Hebrews 10 ver1 for the law having
[38:20] a shadow of good things to come not the
[38:21] very image of the thing can never with
[38:24] those sacrifices which they offered year
[38:25] by year continually make the C there
[38:27] unto perfect but in those sacrifices
[38:30] there's a remembrance every year they
[38:31] had a day of atonement they still do
[38:33] it they don't have a temple but they
[38:36] still the Orthodox Jew they know what
[38:38] the day of atonement is and that's the
[38:39] day that everything gets
[38:41] forgiven right and they're looking to
[38:44] build that Temple so they can start
[38:45] doing that so the Messiah can come for
[38:48] it is not possible that the blood of
[38:49] bulls and goat should take away sin
[38:51] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[38:53] he sayth sacrifice and offerings thou
[38:55] wouldest not but a body hast thou
[38:58] prepared me in other words a body you he
[39:00] prepared one for himself to live in and
[39:03] then he left and come back on the day of
[39:06] Pentecost to get his body ready
[39:08] Hallelujah called a
[39:12] bride so a body thou Hast prepared me
[39:16] let's continue on uh remember brother R
[39:18] say she is him we we understand that
[39:20] let's continue on now look in the seven
[39:22] Church ages brother Brown said look
[39:24] that's the Bible
[39:25] 1954 he said in the midst of the seven
[39:27] candlesticks one like the son of man
[39:29] what one like him who was that his bride
[39:32] so do I need to say that anymore I'm not
[39:33] going to read that scripture again or
[39:35] read that quote again it's the bride
[39:37] standing there bride form it's the son
[39:39] of man standing there but he's in Bride
[39:41] form all right one like him watch
[39:44] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[39:46] the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering
[39:49] her has washed us from our sins with his
[39:52] own blood all right GED about the PS not
[39:54] a man a woman
[39:56] right with a golden girdle look I like
[39:59] what the brother said about the golden
[40:00] girdle what does that girdle do it comes
[40:01] around your waist right it's the gospel
[40:04] that held the power and glory of God
[40:06] over the body of
[40:08] Christ amen the glory held the
[40:11] glory of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[40:14] brother M says in 1954 he says we found
[40:16] the church standing there in its beauty
[40:18] I'm just reviewing a little bit till I
[40:19] get started here Christ just molded into
[40:23] it the church had a white garment on and
[40:25] you notice it was a woman around the
[40:27] breast it had to cover her shame and was
[40:31] had a golden cord though pulled around
[40:33] like that held around the breast white
[40:35] speaking of the righteousness of Christ
[40:37] and the golden girdle representing the
[40:38] gospel the preaching of the Gospel
[40:41] brings the Holy Spirit over the
[40:43] church we're going to see in a minute
[40:45] where that got took
[40:46] away all right by the nician spirit all
[40:50] right and let me caution you if there
[40:53] was a nician spirit in the first church
[40:54] age there's definitely one in the second
[40:56] in the last Church age right which holds
[40:59] something over the people the
[41:00] righteousness of Christ holds it there
[41:03] tied with the string the girdle string
[41:06] all right now here each age has had its
[41:09] message and its messenger all right now
[41:12] some of you got the thing in your hand
[41:14] or around there somewhere this is church
[41:16] Ages which
[41:18] is um I think some of you got them but
[41:22] uh we'll take a look at them a little
[41:23] bit later I'll pull it up on the screen
[41:26] each a age had its message and messenger
[41:29] all through the times every age has
[41:31] packed its message with a messenger like
[41:32] I said before Paul had an age irenius
[41:35] Martin Columba Luther Wesley Pentecost
[41:39] and now in our church age all
[41:41] right cuz remember the church ages
[41:44] started on the day of Pentecost but
[41:46] brother brandom takes the church ages to
[41:48] ad 50s something is when it began we'll
[41:51] get into that in just a minute cuz you
[41:52] got to have listen whatever the pattern
[41:54] is here you got to have over there
[41:56] whatever the pattern is I'm sorry
[41:58] whatever the pattern is here had to have
[42:00] happened in the first church age all
[42:02] right God in every dispensation sent
[42:05] forth someone Anointed with the Holy
[42:06] Spirit to bring forth his message for
[42:08] that age every time now we start back
[42:12] but that was the message God was the
[42:14] first messenger he told Adam and Eve eat
[42:16] that don't eat that that was the message
[42:18] and when man stepped across the message
[42:20] of the hour it brought death and chaos
[42:22] to the whole human race now that's how
[42:25] much that message
[42:27] means abely right only one messenger for
[42:31] each age receives what the spirit has to
[42:33] say to that age and that one messenger
[42:36] is a messenger to the look the true
[42:38] church which would be the
[42:39] bride he speaks for God by Revelation to
[42:43] the churches both true and false the
[42:45] message is then broadcast to all but
[42:48] though it is broadcast for all who come
[42:50] within range of the message that message
[42:52] is received individually by only a
[42:54] certain qualified
[42:57] group of people in a certain
[43:02] way that's why brother brammy said they
[43:04] said what is the Holy Ghost he said
[43:06] accepting the message of the hour for
[43:07] your day accepting it you turn it down
[43:10] you don't have the Holy
[43:13] Ghost those who hear are not getting
[43:15] their own private Revelation nor is a
[43:17] group getting their Collective
[43:18] Revelation but each person is hearing
[43:21] and receiving what the messenger has
[43:23] already received from God so we believe
[43:26] God sent a prophet right well we listen
[43:29] to what he said because it was God
[43:30] speaking to us through that prophet and
[43:32] then we take and we break it down
[43:34] further so that the people can
[43:36] understand that's why you need a
[43:37] five-fold Ministry and not just listen
[43:39] to tapes you can't just listen to tapes
[43:40] and get
[43:44] perfected you can't you might come to
[43:47] the message and believe God sent a
[43:48] prophet and be baptized and all these
[43:50] different things but unless that word
[43:52] comes alive in your
[43:54] heart and we begin to show it began to
[43:56] live it like brother B said you can't
[43:58] show it at
[43:59] home some tried some tried to set it
[44:03] home and we got some that that set it
[44:05] home here and listen listen listen when
[44:06] we're preaching here you we're preaching
[44:08] to a lot of people besides what's
[44:10] sitting in this building today all right
[44:13] and uh then um archive sermons are are
[44:16] are listened all around the
[44:18] world so it's not just us that we're
[44:20] talking to God's not just talking to us
[44:22] here he's talking to worldwide uh this
[44:25] church affects a lot of
[44:27] people it does it affects a lot of
[44:30] people a lot of foreign brothers and
[44:31] different one it affects anything goes
[44:33] on here it affects the it affects the
[44:35] other churches but praise God that's
[44:37] okay now watch look what happened a seal
[44:40] is open what is that now he's in the
[44:42] first seal now watch what he's and I'll
[44:43] break this down a little bit later on
[44:45] and put it on that chart a mystery is
[44:47] unfolding now here you got the day of
[44:49] Pentecost and we'll talk about it in
[44:50] just a minute you got the day of
[44:51] Pentecost Paul wasn't
[44:54] there right all right is everybody
[44:56] listen Paul was not the 120 in the upper
[44:59] room that's when the alpha bride began
[45:02] though was on the day of Pentecost but
[45:05] Paul wasn't
[45:06] there Peter was the spokesman because
[45:09] Paul didn't have the key Peter had the
[45:12] key Paul was out there persecuting them
[45:15] that got born
[45:18] again but he got a
[45:21] conversion could you bring could you
[45:23] imagine bringing your arch enemy into
[45:24] your room
[45:26] right and say oh we got to listen to him
[45:29] now and anas is like Lord you sure that
[45:33] that's all he's killed a bunch of my
[45:35] friends he caused him to blaspheme he
[45:37] put them in prison he said oh I got to
[45:39] work for him don't worry I listen my
[45:42] ways are not your ways my ways are way
[45:44] above yours Paul's going to be my
[45:47] messenger Peter had the key to unlock
[45:49] the door but Peter says and we'll read
[45:51] it this afternoon where Peter says that
[45:52] Paul says things hard to be understood
[45:54] so Paul Peter didn't have the same
[45:56] Revelation Paul
[45:57] did I didn't say it was different he
[46:00] didn't have the same because you got
[46:02] different levels of Revelation so watch
[46:04] when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds
[46:07] Paul steps on the scene announces his
[46:09] message it declares a war what that war
[46:11] is what killed him that's war that war
[46:14] is what killed Jesus that war is what
[46:16] killed all the church age back in that
[46:19] first church age the martyrs they didn't
[46:21] weren't martyred because they didn't
[46:22] like them and they weren't martyred
[46:24] because of their ethnicity they were
[46:26] murdered because of their different view
[46:30] of the present day
[46:32] gospel amen now if that happened in the
[46:35] first
[46:37] age it's got to happen here too but they
[46:39] don't have brother Ram he he magnifies
[46:41] it he says oh they don't have to kill
[46:43] you personally he said they just kill
[46:45] your
[46:47] influence the angelist church catches
[46:49] the mystery of God so Paul called The
[46:51] Mystery of God not fully yet revealed
[46:54] but when he does he catches this mystery
[46:55] of God and He Goes Forth and what he
[46:58] preaches to the people and they
[47:01] listen after the mystery has been given
[47:03] to him Goes Forth to the people what
[47:05] does he do out there he begins to
[47:07] proclaim the message and what does it
[47:09] start it starts a spiritual war all
[47:12] right and when God takes his messenger
[47:14] with the elect of that age and lays him
[47:16] away like I just said when he's finished
[47:18] with the messenger he's done with
[47:21] him you say that sounds rough that's the
[47:24] way God said he was going to do from the
[47:26] beginning to the end amen when he's
[47:28] finished he's finished all right he
[47:30] don't raise him back
[47:32] up and then God takes his messenger with
[47:34] the elect of that age and lays them away
[47:36] asleep then he drops a plague upon them
[47:39] that reject
[47:41] it problem is now you reject this
[47:44] message and you going to go into a real
[47:46] plague like called a tribulation
[47:49] period he drops a plague upon them who
[47:52] rejected a temporary judgment that's why
[47:55] we see all the flames of fire foot of
[47:56] brass and all the different things God
[47:58] in judgment the bride is going to judge
[48:00] every Church age every every bride
[48:02] member in their age will judge the
[48:04] people of that age all right they
[48:07] denominated bring in denomination and
[48:09] started off that man's work like Wesley
[48:12] and all the rest of them then it gets
[48:13] into a scrapple again and then another
[48:15] mystery comes forth and what happens
[48:17] another messenger arrives on Earth for a
[48:19] church age like I was saying last week
[48:21] you got Paul he preaches he preaches
[48:23] there's a lot of people come into the
[48:25] message
[48:27] then as you get long and further just
[48:29] like you and I sight and time is what
[48:31] our worst
[48:32] enemy we start falling away from our
[48:35] first love and then God sends irenius
[48:37] and says hey here's a message I want you
[48:39] to give this group of people and it
[48:41] raises back up the problem now is
[48:43] there's no way the only thing if you go
[48:45] down you go into tribulation there is no
[48:46] other Messenger to bring you back up all
[48:50] right there has to be an alpha and there
[48:51] has to be a Omega and when he arrives
[48:54] the trumpet sounds what a message
[48:57] declares a
[48:58] war but then what happens finally he's
[49:00] called away then when he's laid away
[49:02] then plagues fall destroys them look
[49:05] spiritual death hits the
[49:08] church and she's gone that group then he
[49:11] goes on to another one all right
[49:13] Revelations 1 ver8 I am Alpha and Omega
[49:15] he said this four times in in Revelation
[49:18] I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[49:20] the ending sayith the Lord which is and
[49:21] which was and which is to come the
[49:24] almighty showing his de
[49:26] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[49:28] and the last what thou seeth write in a
[49:30] book and send it to the seven churches
[49:32] now remember the alpha church was
[49:34] Ephesus the Omega Church is leosa the
[49:37] one you're sitting in right now and it
[49:39] is the beginning and ending of the
[49:41] Gentile bride dispensation all right
[49:43] everybody with me cuz while H when the
[49:45] last Gentile is saved the door is closed
[49:48] God will never save another
[49:50] Gentile amen until the white Throne
[49:52] judgment he may give him eternal life
[49:54] that's okay but he turns directly to the
[49:56] Jews God doesn't ever go backwards he
[49:59] always goes forward I'm going to get to
[50:01] the Jews I'm going to get 144,000 I'm
[50:03] going to bring them in and then I'm
[50:04] going to bring my bride back to the
[50:06] Earth in the Millennium with 144,000 he
[50:09] just keeps
[50:10] moving you know what he does though he
[50:12] takes me and you with it if we don't
[50:16] stop
[50:19] amen he was both Alpha and Omega of
[50:22] course all that was in between the two
[50:25] all the other letters but he
[50:27] specifically said Alpha and Omega what
[50:28] brother man saying is now he wasn't the
[50:30] holy ghost in the first age and Holy
[50:32] Ghost in the seventh age and nothing in
[50:33] between he was the Holy Ghost in every
[50:36] Church age but there was a gift given
[50:39] different for the alpha CU that was a
[50:41] beginning that's the way he want his
[50:42] church
[50:43] started and the Omega is the way he
[50:45] wants the church to
[50:46] end and they've got to be together
[50:49] excuse my voice I've been dealing with
[50:52] some sinus drainage but he specifically
[50:55] said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow
[50:57] over his head which was his Covenant now
[50:59] if you notice the light of Pentecost
[51:01] where it started gradually smothered
[51:04] out all right these men irenius polycart
[51:08] and all the rest of them sealed their
[51:09] testimony with their blood until it
[51:11] finally squeez Christianity into the
[51:14] dark days or the Dark Ages or that
[51:15] middle age that 1500 age that the
[51:17] Catholic Church ruled the world now look
[51:19] the first age the other side of that
[51:21] great hump coming over now had what the
[51:23] middle then the next one was what Luther
[51:26] Wesley Pentecost leosa called lukew all
[51:31] right in the sardian church age Christ
[51:33] Holy Spirit still holding here on down
[51:36] here until the end of the world the same
[51:38] holy spirit that filled Paul with the
[51:40] Holy Ghost and the things that he done
[51:42] will fill this one irenius full of the
[51:44] Holy Ghost fill Martin full of the Holy
[51:45] Ghost and the rest of them full of the
[51:46] Holy Ghost and it filled you and I full
[51:51] of the Holy Ghost and it's a Pentecostal
[51:54] blessing from one Church age to the
[51:56] other now the problem with people in P
[51:58] in in the message there's two factions
[52:00] one said we need to stay in Pentecost
[52:02] and and and accept the message and still
[52:05] have our you know our shouting good time
[52:07] and then there's a group over here that
[52:08] says God left that and you know we just
[52:11] got the message and that's it well what
[52:13] happens is is you got to bring it right
[52:14] in
[52:15] between you got to bring it right in the
[52:17] middle all right we as a church should
[52:19] have the Pentecostal blessing I wish
[52:22] somebody would shout I wish somebody
[52:23] would speaking tongues I wish somebody
[52:24] would AIS but that not every
[52:28] service not every
[52:30] service I like what brother Donnie
[52:31] Reagan said he said look when you're at
[52:33] home that's home
[52:34] church he said special meetings are
[52:36] special run shout speaking
[52:39] tongue cuz you're happy you're going to
[52:41] a meeting you you're meeting your fellow
[52:43] members and you you but he said at
[52:45] home he does the same thing here at his
[52:48] church and he says hey well you know
[52:49] wake up a little bit
[52:52] here so look his hand transforms a cross
[52:56] and and here's Jesus standing in the
[52:57] church age and said I am Alpha and Omega
[52:59] in other words I'll be the Supreme in
[53:02] the first and I'll be the Supreme in the
[53:06] last all right now what did he do in the
[53:09] first chapter of Revelations he revealed
[53:11] his Supreme deity to the first church
[53:13] Ephesus now in the in the Church of
[53:15] Ephesus they didn't have a trinitarian
[53:19] Doctrine they started one they didn't
[53:22] the the bride didn't now over here same
[53:24] thing
[53:25] You Got trinitarianism The Whole World's
[53:28] covered by
[53:29] trinitarianism and brother Brown said
[53:31] that seed that was planted by Satan in
[53:33] the first church age has grown into a
[53:35] tree over here in this age and then he
[53:38] said I read this to you several several
[53:39] several Services ago that those two
[53:41] Vines are
[53:43] intertwined and without the Holy Ghost
[53:45] you won't be able to tell one Vine from
[53:47] the
[53:49] other deceive the very elect if it were
[53:52] possible so so close not so far away
[53:57] every one of these churches come down
[53:58] through here he revealed himself in
[54:01] deity now watch his wording he revealed
[54:04] himself in deity only in his glorified
[54:09] form because
[54:11] remember Columba was a
[54:13] trinitarian Luther was a
[54:15] trinitarian Wesley was a trinitarian and
[54:18] the first part of Pentecost was
[54:20] trinitarian now that didn't come from
[54:21] the mind of God but he winked at their
[54:24] ignorance and gave them something else
[54:26] gave Luther the just shall live by faith
[54:29] gave Wesley living S A Sanctified life
[54:32] but for me and you to be the two book
[54:33] ends we've got to that's why that that
[54:36] brother R said this messenger of Malachi
[54:38] do Malachi 4 do two things what return
[54:41] us back to what they preached in the
[54:43] first church age all right and then
[54:46] bring the seals to change our body they
[54:48] didn't have that to change their body
[54:49] down here they had the word of God they
[54:52] didn't have a denomination well they did
[54:54] but they didn't have one on every
[54:55] corner like we
[54:57] do and a lot of times in our
[55:01] congregation every one of these churches
[55:03] coming down through here he revealed
[55:04] himself in deity only in his glorified
[55:06] form but on this last one he becomes Z
[55:10] back to the original beginning again see
[55:13] the first and the last the first age now
[55:15] the last age for he said I am the first
[55:17] and the last Masterpiece the first
[55:20] Ministry and the last Ministry is the
[55:22] same the first message and the or last
[55:25] message is the same thing as I was in
[55:28] Alpha I'm in Omega there'll be a day
[55:30] that won't be called day or night but in
[55:31] the evening time what the sun the Sun
[55:34] what comes up in the
[55:35] East and sets in the
[55:38] west we're a Western
[55:41] Country hello for those that are
[55:44] geographically challenged that's why
[55:46] they call it the Middle East cuz it's
[55:48] over there and then what is opposite
[55:51] from
[55:52] East somebody help me thank you
[55:55] West okay but there'll be a day that
[55:58] won't be called day or night but in the
[56:00] evening time right now today you're in
[56:02] the evening light of the message of the
[56:04] hour you're in the evening light of the
[56:08] ending of the Gentile
[56:10] dispensation see Alpha and Omega but it
[56:12] becomes the first and last said we could
[56:15] stay for hours now remember the vision
[56:17] brother R had he he had a the bride came
[56:19] into view then all of a sudden they went
[56:22] off praising God and dressed right and
[56:24] all that then here come the American
[56:27] church that was naked twisting turning
[56:30] shaking and all that different stuff and
[56:31] he was having a hard time looking at it
[56:34] and he he turned to the to the angel and
[56:36] said is this what I produced and the
[56:38] angel said hold on a
[56:39] minute the bride will come into view
[56:42] again well that was the alpha bride that
[56:45] went
[56:46] by and the Omega bride was the last one
[56:49] that come by sure she got out step a
[56:51] little bit but she was dressed right and
[56:53] brother R is the one that followed and
[56:55] said get back in line well I'm telling
[56:57] us get back in
[57:00] line but the Bride come into view twice
[57:04] he said that's the reason she was in
[57:05] view reviewed the second time she was
[57:08] reviewed the first time then she was
[57:09] reviewed the second time she was
[57:11] perfectly the second like she was in the
[57:14] first all
[57:15] right the only thing we can glory in is
[57:18] that God started that church right and
[57:19] if we'll get in that church we'll be
[57:21] started right and we'll actually end
[57:23] right all right but the bride came back
[57:26] cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the
[57:27] great sculptor and made him a
[57:29] masterpiece for it's a piece of his
[57:30] first masterpiece like he did in the
[57:32] Garden of Eden and took a piece from and
[57:34] made another piece Adam and made Eve and
[57:36] was that was marred and fail now he's
[57:38] been all this time building it back
[57:40] again and he brought forth this
[57:41] masterpiece was smitten in order that
[57:43] part of it was smitten in order to bring
[57:45] back again that Masterpiece what was he
[57:47] saying Masterpiece First Church age
[57:49] smitten during the ages false Doctrine
[57:53] death huh come on then he's come over
[57:56] here to get his Masterpiece again he had
[57:59] to come through all that to get the
[58:01] Masterpiece again all right is everybody
[58:03] with me so the Masterpiece and the Son
[58:05] of God the Masterpiece and the bride
[58:07] it's a piece of
[58:09] him which must be the fulfilling of the
[58:13] word of God Revelations 2 verse1 so
[58:16] let's look at this under the angel the
[58:19] Church of La of Ephesus right now we
[58:21] looked at that and saw the how Ephesus
[58:23] and lus says of not in all right these
[58:26] things sayth he that holdeth the Seven
[58:28] Stars now this is this is what the first
[58:30] Age come under and his right hand who
[58:33] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[58:34] coun counter sticks I Know Thy works and
[58:37] thy labor and thy patience now remember
[58:40] this is the first stage but it's also
[58:41] connected to us and how thou cast not
[58:44] bear them which are
[58:46] evil false
[58:48] Doctrine and thou Hast tried them which
[58:50] say the apostles and are not and H has
[58:52] found them Liars
[58:55] what brother say give the word
[58:57] test and has borne and has patience and
[59:00] for my name's sake H hasth labored and
[59:03] has not fainted nevertheless I have
[59:05] somewhat against thee because thou Hast
[59:07] left thy first love all of a sudden here
[59:10] we are in from ad30 which is the day of
[59:13] Pentecost to ad50 something they already
[59:16] had people intertwined in their sermon
[59:19] or in their congregation that was going
[59:22] Jesus wasn't really gone sthus was one
[59:25] close in irenius but but he was a like
[59:28] substance he couldn't have been God cuz
[59:29] he had all this
[59:31] these that's how it got started we'll
[59:34] talk about in just a second it starts as
[59:35] a
[59:36] saying to a deed to a Doctrine
[59:41] right nevertheless because th left your
[59:43] first love remember therefore from when
[59:45] thou art Fallen now look remember where
[59:47] you came
[59:49] from remember the day of Pentecost
[59:52] remember your day of Pentecost the day
[59:54] you re receive the Holy Ghost is your
[59:56] day of
[59:57] Pentecost God filled you with the Holy
[59:59] Ghost if you could have seen a tongue of
[1:00:01] fire it would have been a tongue of fire
[1:00:03] over your head and it fell right down in
[1:00:04] your soul burnt you out made you a new
[1:00:07] Creator in creature in Christ that ought
[1:00:10] to make you happy that ought to make the
[1:00:12] ball game people shout
[1:00:14] remember was that a
[1:00:17] AI okay all right I didn't think there
[1:00:19] ever was an old guy sitting in a ball
[1:00:20] game doing like
[1:00:22] that remember therefore from whence Thou
[1:00:25] Art fallen and repent now remember how
[1:00:28] are you reminded Paul writes letters to
[1:00:31] Corinthians
[1:00:32] Ephesians
[1:00:34] Timothy Corinthians second time all
[1:00:38] these different he's reminding them of
[1:00:42] the message of the hour that's why we
[1:00:44] stand in the pull pit and remind you of
[1:00:46] the message of the hour we don't say
[1:00:48] something different from brother
[1:00:50] Brandon we remind you of what he's
[1:00:52] already said all right but now look if
[1:00:56] you don't repent if you don't continue
[1:00:59] on with me he said I am going to remove
[1:01:03] your Candlestick in other words you are
[1:01:05] going to quench the Holy Ghost right out
[1:01:07] of your service right
[1:01:10] right I will remove thy Candlestick out
[1:01:13] of his place except thou repent now he
[1:01:16] goes on and continues but this thou has
[1:01:19] there was one thing that first age
[1:01:21] had that God loved
[1:01:25] that thou hatest the Deeds of the
[1:01:27] nicians which I also hate so God can't
[1:01:32] change his mind if he hated it in the
[1:01:34] first age he's going to hate it in this
[1:01:36] age everybody with me he hates it he
[1:01:39] doesn't he he don't even want to
[1:01:40] tolerate
[1:01:41] it in his bride church now what is the
[1:01:46] Deeds of the nicians a deed is an
[1:01:48] undertaking an act something you do all
[1:01:52] right and this is kind of strange cuz I
[1:01:54] want you to see how Satan is he's not
[1:01:57] far from the truth even with a nickan
[1:02:00] attitude there was actually a man named
[1:02:03] Nicholas and look in your Bible it's in
[1:02:05] the book of Acts I didn't know it he's
[1:02:06] one of seven men that was given the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost to lead the church
[1:02:12] with they took and misconstrued
[1:02:14] Nicholas's Doctrine and look what
[1:02:17] happened cuz nican niik actually means
[1:02:21] Victory or conquer and that's where you
[1:02:23] get the word Nike from that's why you
[1:02:24] wear your shoes it says Nike it's got
[1:02:26] the Nike thing on it cuz it's victory
[1:02:28] that hurt cuz it's
[1:02:30] victory but anyway it mean that's what
[1:02:32] Nike means
[1:02:34] Nico Victory or conquer victory over
[1:02:38] letin means members or Ley in other
[1:02:41] words the congregation now watch nanism
[1:02:45] means followers of Nicholas so they
[1:02:46] started following the right set
[1:02:49] everybody with me this sound familiar
[1:02:52] they started following the person of the
[1:02:54] hour all right or one of them named
[1:02:57] Nicholas is in the
[1:02:59] Bible all right whose Deeds were
[1:03:02] strongly
[1:03:03] condemned they may have been identical
[1:03:06] with those who held the doctrine of
[1:03:09] balum they seem to have held it that was
[1:03:12] it was lawful to eat things sacrificed
[1:03:14] to Idols commit fornication in
[1:03:16] opposition to the decree of the church
[1:03:19] rendered in Acts 15:20 the teachers of
[1:03:22] the church branded them with a name
[1:03:24] which expressed their true character the
[1:03:26] men who did and taught such things were
[1:03:28] followers of balam let me stop right
[1:03:30] here real quick brother arm tells us
[1:03:32] about old balum remember balam was a
[1:03:35] prophet of
[1:03:37] God God spoke to balam Bam was a prophet
[1:03:42] so they so the whoever that is got balam
[1:03:46] and said hey I want you we we know you
[1:03:49] hear from
[1:03:51] God right we know you hear from God we
[1:03:56] want you to curse them people over there
[1:03:57] called Israelites we hate them they're
[1:04:00] just a thorn in our
[1:04:02] flesh I want you to curse him what' bam
[1:04:05] say he said I can only say What God
[1:04:11] Says and God couldn't condemn him cuz
[1:04:13] that was his kids so what did the guy
[1:04:17] say he says
[1:04:19] uh balum uh whatever you do uh is you a
[1:04:24] little bit of payment here if you'll
[1:04:26] just hang around a little bit and no
[1:04:28] you're not you if you'll just hang
[1:04:30] around a little bit we'll get you some
[1:04:31] more of this that's my brother R called
[1:04:33] bam a hirling
[1:04:36] prophet all right we I've seen it before
[1:04:40] you can't have a hirling prophet in the
[1:04:42] message of the hour yeah you can have
[1:04:45] one yeah but it ain't
[1:04:48] right cuz bam said I can only say what
[1:04:52] God Said but
[1:04:55] I got some smarts about me since I'm
[1:04:57] getting paid I got to do my
[1:05:01] job I can get them to
[1:05:04] mingle with each other and remember that
[1:05:07] was it that was the downfall that's
[1:05:09] called a hirling prophet or the doctrine
[1:05:11] of balum all right and balum was a hired
[1:05:14] Pro hired prophet he was a prophet but
[1:05:16] he was hired to do a job that's why um
[1:05:21] through this whole thing I want y'all to
[1:05:23] understand something
[1:05:25] a hirling is somebody gets
[1:05:28] paid and if they don't do their job they
[1:05:31] don't get paid right okay just want you
[1:05:35] to realize that that's why a pastor
[1:05:37] should is never going to have somebody
[1:05:38] tell them how much you can make it's not
[1:05:41] the way it is you can't insert yourself
[1:05:44] above from God to the pastor pastor's
[1:05:46] complete control Supreme control either
[1:05:49] that or you're a
[1:05:51] hirling well you can say this but don't
[1:05:53] say that or we'll will withdraw money
[1:05:54] from you remember brother Dell said
[1:05:56] that's what they did in in uh the church
[1:05:58] that we used to go to if they didn't
[1:05:59] like the preacher what he preached they
[1:06:01] just withdrew his his
[1:06:03] pay told him said if you don't preach
[1:06:05] this we're going to hold your pay or if
[1:06:07] you going to go do that in the pull pit
[1:06:08] we're going to withhold your pay now
[1:06:10] folks that's balam Spirit that's a
[1:06:12] denominational Spirit that's a nickan
[1:06:14] spirit which God
[1:06:16] hates everybody with me I'm in the Bible
[1:06:18] I'm not emotional I'm just in the Bible
[1:06:21] this the Bible tells us what to do
[1:06:23] absolutely cuz look they persuaded men
[1:06:26] more than ever that it was a thing
[1:06:28] indiffer they got up and said hey don't
[1:06:30] worry about you ain't got to do you
[1:06:32] ain't got to go church just press
[1:06:35] play mingling themselves look this was
[1:06:39] bad enough but there was yet a worse
[1:06:41] evil mingling themselves with the orgies
[1:06:43] of idolatrous feast they brought the
[1:06:45] impurities of those Feast into the
[1:06:48] meetings of the Christian
[1:06:51] church and all this was done it must be
[1:06:54] remembered not simply as an Indulgence
[1:06:56] of appetite but as part of a
[1:06:59] system supported by Doctrine accompanied
[1:07:03] by the boast of prophetic
[1:07:07] illumination wow to hate these Deeds
[1:07:10] though is a sign of life in a church see
[1:07:13] that's why Church you have got to
[1:07:15] understand one thing there is no person
[1:07:17] in this church has a boat different than
[1:07:20] yours nobody Amen brother Brown says I
[1:07:24] have one only have one vote and I only
[1:07:26] vote if there's a tie so the pastor
[1:07:29] doesn't even vote but you have one vote
[1:07:32] no person has three votes and you got
[1:07:33] one you all got one vote if you're a
[1:07:35] tithe paying member of the church you
[1:07:37] get one vote but if you want to keep the
[1:07:39] dies of nians around and be suppressed
[1:07:42] and go right ahead I saw a church up in
[1:07:44] Pennsylvania bless your heart you've
[1:07:46] been there before brother Jim youat
[1:07:48] Church where there was a deacon that run
[1:07:50] a place I mean he run a place and I knew
[1:07:54] that cuz I went up there and they asked
[1:07:55] me to consider being pastor this been 20
[1:07:57] years ago brother Jim was a little bit
[1:07:59] younger then brother Michael met brother
[1:08:01] Jim shate so brother Jim sheate was
[1:08:03] trying to find were trying to find a
[1:08:04] pastor the pastor died and this one
[1:08:06] Deacon he had come into a large sum of
[1:08:09] money and he ran to
[1:08:14] church well it's a truth I tell you how
[1:08:17] he done though he conquered the Ley so
[1:08:19] bad to nobody move without him saying
[1:08:22] anything and they went years without a
[1:08:24] pastor finally got a couple up there and
[1:08:27] then at the very end toward the boat one
[1:08:29] of the brothers said well hey I need to
[1:08:30] see the I need to see the church books
[1:08:33] and I you know this and and the brother
[1:08:35] said no no uh uh I'm going to pay you
[1:08:37] this and this is what it's going to be
[1:08:38] and you're going to be well the guy said
[1:08:40] no you ain't going to get nobody in this
[1:08:42] message to do that I'll promise you
[1:08:46] that but 6 months later after that
[1:08:49] Pastor left I mean that they were going
[1:08:52] to put him in VOD him in or V him out
[1:08:55] whatever V him in Brother David fell
[1:08:58] over Dead with a heart
[1:08:59] attack 6 months later and then brother
[1:09:02] Jim shoemate took over as the pastor of
[1:09:04] the church God's going to have his
[1:09:07] way and he hates the Deeds of the nickol
[1:09:10] he hates for us to be suppressed all of
[1:09:12] us we need to have freedom to worship
[1:09:14] any way we want to we need to have
[1:09:16] freedom to say hey I love you I love you
[1:09:18] I love you and mean it but you hate
[1:09:22] those deeds as a L of life in a church
[1:09:26] to hate
[1:09:28] them
[1:09:31] but if you tolerate
[1:09:33] them to tolerate them is well not to
[1:09:36] Forfeit the glory of having been
[1:09:39] Faithfully under persecution to tolerate
[1:09:42] them you're going to die to hate
[1:09:47] them you have
[1:09:51] life God's going to have a church amen
[1:09:54] run right he cuz listen and he had it
[1:09:58] run right in the first church
[1:10:01] age and brother Brandon was over here in
[1:10:03] the last Church age and he says all
[1:10:05] right this is the way it's supposed to
[1:10:06] be you read condori Doctrine that's
[1:10:08] exactly the way the church was running
[1:10:09] it first is the way it should be run now
[1:10:12] right all right he didn't deviate from
[1:10:14] that brother B didn't add he said this
[1:10:16] is what they did in the first church so
[1:10:18] this is what we're going to do here he
[1:10:19] that have the near let him hear what the
[1:10:21] spirit sayth un the churches to him that
[1:10:23] overcome will I give to e of the tree of
[1:10:24] life which is in the midst of the
[1:10:25] paradise of God so now the alpha church
[1:10:28] is born now the alpha church was not
[1:10:31] born with Paul
[1:10:33] around this is important because as a
[1:10:36] messenger in the church ages I believe
[1:10:39] it was Columba died before the church
[1:10:42] age even started but his message listen
[1:10:46] God wants the message to go
[1:10:49] forth get away from a man yes sir you
[1:10:52] put a man up here God going to take him
[1:10:54] out of the
[1:10:55] way you put God up here through a man
[1:10:59] then you'll s you'll be
[1:11:02] successful the alpha church is
[1:11:05] born acts 1 ver7 he said unto them it is
[1:11:08] not for you to die this is Jesus now
[1:11:09] he's fix he's going to tell the church
[1:11:11] where to start at thank God Jesus is the
[1:11:14] one doing
[1:11:16] this it's not for you to know the times
[1:11:18] or Seasons cuz what look they're they're
[1:11:21] they've come up to here sister Virginia
[1:11:22] they've come up to here and they're all
[1:11:24] around him and they said he said I'm I
[1:11:26] got to go away I you know in other words
[1:11:28] John 17 he said I'm going to get out of
[1:11:30] here destroy this Temple I'm going to
[1:11:32] raise it up I I've been resurrected now
[1:11:34] for 50 days y'all know I've been walking
[1:11:36] around in a glorified body for 50 days
[1:11:38] and they're going you going to stay here
[1:11:40] and restore the
[1:11:41] kingdom and he and he's
[1:11:45] like have I not taught you anything no
[1:11:48] he was
[1:11:49] longsuffering and this is what he said
[1:11:52] it's not for you to know the times of
[1:11:53] the seasons which the father ha put in
[1:11:55] his own power but you shall receive
[1:11:57] power transfer of power after that the
[1:12:01] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:12:02] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:12:04] Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the
[1:12:07] uttermost parts of the earth and we're
[1:12:09] living by that right now cuz whatever
[1:12:12] that first church started Living by we
[1:12:14] got to live by it or we're not the
[1:12:15] church in the end time all right and
[1:12:17] when he had spoken these things while
[1:12:19] they beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[1:12:22] received him out of their sight and
[1:12:25] while they look steadfast toward heaven
[1:12:26] now remember whatever happens in the
[1:12:28] first church age has got to happen in
[1:12:30] the last Church
[1:12:32] age Christ left in a cloud and last
[1:12:37] Church age he came back in the
[1:12:40] cloud all right cuz look this is the
[1:12:42] prophecy and while they look steadfast
[1:12:44] toward Heaven two men stood by them in
[1:12:46] white apparel two angels stepped in the
[1:12:48] dimension stood there and told him and
[1:12:50] said which also said you been of Galilee
[1:12:52] why are you gazing up into
[1:12:54] heaven this same Jesus which is taken
[1:12:57] from you into heaven shall so come in
[1:12:59] like manner as you have seen him go into
[1:13:01] heaven and we believe that the Lord came
[1:13:04] on in 1963 now not his whole not his
[1:13:07] body but the doctrine the doctrine of
[1:13:10] the seals it put everything back
[1:13:12] together it put everything the way it
[1:13:13] was supposed to be Christ came down in
[1:13:16] Revelations 10:7 and put everything
[1:13:19] together Luke
[1:13:22] 24:46 and he said said unto them thus it
[1:13:24] is written and thus it behooved Christ
[1:13:26] to suffer and to rise from the dead the
[1:13:27] third day and that repentance and
[1:13:30] remission of sin should be preached in
[1:13:32] his name among all nations beginning at
[1:13:33] Jerusalem so the beginning of the of the
[1:13:36] now listen hold on a
[1:13:37] minute let me interject something
[1:13:40] here they come in under a Pentecostal
[1:13:45] age Ephesian Church age didn't start to
[1:13:48] ad50
[1:13:50] something that's not a church age that's
[1:13:52] got a circle but if you look on your
[1:13:54] chart right there at the first it's not
[1:13:56] written in there yet but they're going
[1:13:57] to write that in there you're going to
[1:13:59] write Pentecost CU if the first age
[1:14:02] listen they got to be
[1:14:03] miror if the first age CH started with
[1:14:07] Pentecost the last age started with 1906
[1:14:10] Auda Street
[1:14:11] Pentecost to open up the age the Alpha
[1:14:14] and the Omega got to be the
[1:14:17] same but remember they didn't they
[1:14:21] didn't stand that they continued on they
[1:14:24] picked up Paul you know what I'm talking
[1:14:27] about they were preaching for 20
[1:14:28] something years before Paul well
[1:14:30] actually they were preaching and Paul
[1:14:31] was killing them for that 20 something
[1:14:33] years he was he was uh the thorn in
[1:14:36] their
[1:14:38] flesh now look and what repentance and
[1:14:41] remission of sin should be preached in
[1:14:42] his name among all nations beginning at
[1:14:44] Jerusalem now remember there was a lot
[1:14:47] of Jews in that 120 the upper room but
[1:14:49] remember when they went downstairs and
[1:14:51] we'll get to it not this afternoon but
[1:14:53] but later on the day of Pentecost is a
[1:14:56] day of
[1:14:57] feasting people Gather in that's why
[1:14:59] there was when when Peter goes out and
[1:15:01] he speaks and tells the people all of
[1:15:03] them are looking at each other and
[1:15:04] there's a about
[1:15:07] um there's probably two verses of
[1:15:10] nothing but scythians and and galileans
[1:15:13] and it names all the people why they
[1:15:14] were gathered at Pentecost wasn't just a
[1:15:16] Jewish
[1:15:17] feast huh when you have a when you have
[1:15:20] a i a say it when you have a feast
[1:15:23] around here more people come so anyway
[1:15:26] while they were having their Pentecostal
[1:15:28] Feast there were people that come but
[1:15:31] but listen God had to do that because he
[1:15:33] wanted to take that to the Gentiles all
[1:15:35] those were Gentiles Peter goes outside
[1:15:37] he preaches a sermon and they say what
[1:15:40] oh we're pricked in our heart we never
[1:15:41] heard this before what do we need to do
[1:15:43] he said repent be baptized in the name
[1:15:45] of Jesus Christ for they Mission your
[1:15:47] sin you shall receive the gift of the
[1:15:49] Holy Ghost and 3,000 people were saved
[1:15:52] in one day boy what a baptismal
[1:15:55] service 3,000 in one
[1:15:59] day and it was not Jews it was all
[1:16:04] Gentiles and you a witness of these
[1:16:06] things and behold I send the promise of
[1:16:08] my father upon you now this is what
[1:16:09] we'll get to this afternoon behold I'll
[1:16:11] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:16:14] because remember Peter said my promise
[1:16:16] his promise is to be the son of David in
[1:16:20] the Millennium to rule the 12 tribes of
[1:16:22] Israel he knew what he was saying
[1:16:24] because listen David's Throne is in the
[1:16:28] Millennium he sat on his daddy's Throne
[1:16:31] or the father's Throne by the baptism of
[1:16:33] the Holy Ghost to the church
[1:16:34] ages that's why he's saying right here
[1:16:36] I'll prove it to you I'll read you the
[1:16:38] quotes Brother D preached it a long time
[1:16:41] ago about the father's Throne he
[1:16:42] preached several sermons on that and you
[1:16:44] are witness of these things and behold I
[1:16:46] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:16:49] but carry ye in the city of Jerusalem
[1:16:51] until you be endued with power
[1:16:53] from on high now Acts 2 verse1 says when
[1:16:56] the day of Pentecost was fully come what
[1:16:58] does Pentecost mean pent means what 5 50
[1:17:01] all right so 50 was fully come they were

[1:17:12] clothing tongues like as a fire and it
[1:17:14] sat upon each of them and they were all
[1:17:16] filled with a Holy Ghost and began to
[1:17:18] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:17:19] gave them utterance and they were
[1:17:21] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men

[1:19:30] sermon cuz what would have happened if
[1:19:32] Paul if Peter would have had stood out
[1:19:33] there and said it in every one of these
[1:19:35] languages or like brother Brown said he
[1:19:37] would go overseas and he' been he'd be
[1:19:39] in Africa and he'd say God bless you and
[1:19:41] it'd be 14 different people would have
[1:19:44] to say God bless you and and there in
[1:19:45] the another language but God made sure
[1:19:49] he got this message
[1:19:51] right through Peter and just change
[1:19:55] their hearing he that have a ear let him
[1:19:58] hear what the spirit says to the
[1:20:01] church so this church was what born by
[1:20:05] the Breath of God we already covered
[1:20:06] this oh did you get it the Church of God
[1:20:09] is born of the Breath of God God
[1:20:11] breathed breath into the nostril
[1:20:13] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:20:14] living Soul did you know the
[1:20:16] Pentecostals are look he said the true
[1:20:18] Pentecostal church is born of the Breath
[1:20:20] of God so guess what in the end time
[1:20:23] brother Ram had to preach and tell us
[1:20:25] that we were born by the Breath of God
[1:20:27] all right not by a
[1:20:30] man Pentecost meaning the 50th day or
[1:20:33] harvest feast or Feast of Wheats may be
[1:20:35] regarded as a supplement to the Passover
[1:20:37] it lasted for about one day from the
[1:20:39] 16th of Nissen seven weeks were reckoned
[1:20:41] inclusively and the next or 50th day was
[1:20:44] the day of Pentecost to make all that
[1:20:46] clear there was a there was a jubilee
[1:20:47] ever seven years right according to
[1:20:49] Leviticus 258 but when you come to that
[1:20:52] seven sevens when you come seven cycles
[1:20:55] of that seven year period you had a day
[1:20:58] you had a day that everything that was
[1:21:00] your golden jubilee all right or the day
[1:21:03] of pente
[1:21:05] cost it lasted for a day it was the 50th
[1:21:08] day was the day of Pentecost which fell
[1:21:09] on the 6th of s it tells you when it is
[1:21:12] the Pentecost was the Jewish Harvest
[1:21:14] home and the people were especially
[1:21:15] exhorted to Rejoice before Jehovah with
[1:21:18] their families their servants the levit
[1:21:20] so it was a big celebration it wasn't
[1:21:21] just like I'm going to just plot my 120
[1:21:24] and out here in the woods somewhere and
[1:21:26] y'all going to receive the Holy Ghost he
[1:21:27] showed it to the whole
[1:21:29] world without seeing
[1:21:34] in and fox let me put them on both
[1:21:37] end but he had everybody there in
[1:21:40] position and what those that got the
[1:21:41] Holy Ghost what' they do they went back
[1:21:43] home oh yeah they took the Holy Ghost
[1:21:46] back home with them amen let's try that
[1:21:49] sometime take the Holy Ghost back home
[1:21:51] with them and then they noise did
[1:21:53] abroad and people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:21:56] after
[1:21:58] that God's word will never fail God will
[1:22:01] never be
[1:22:03] stopped acts 2:32 this Jesus hath God
[1:22:06] raised up it's say Peter where of all we
[1:22:08] Are Witnesses and we'll stop right here
[1:22:10] therefore being by the right hand of God
[1:22:12] exalted now
[1:22:14] look I I'll show you this this afternoon
[1:22:17] being on the right hand of God which is
[1:22:20] his father's Throne or power but he is
[1:22:23] in a Corporal body and he has to stay in
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:26] Dimension cuz you're his body so he
[1:22:29] stays over here but what does he do he
[1:22:30] doesn't just sit there and sleep he
[1:22:32] sends the Holy Ghost back on the day of
[1:22:34] Pentecost same person in a different
[1:22:38] dispensation he sends them and gives
[1:22:41] them the
[1:22:42] power having received of the Father the
[1:22:44] promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed
[1:22:46] forth this which you now see in here for
[1:22:49] David has not ascended into the heavens
[1:22:50] but he saith himself the Lord Lord sent
[1:22:52] unto my Lord sit th on my right hand
[1:22:54] until I make thy fo foes thy foot stols
[1:22:57] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:22:59] know assuredly boy Peter's preaching a
[1:23:01] powerful 20 minute sermon that God hath
[1:23:03] made that same Jesus whom you have
[1:23:05] crucified both Lord and Christ now when
[1:23:08] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:23:10] their heart and they said unto Peter and
[1:23:11] the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:23:12] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[1:23:15] said unto them
[1:23:17] repent we forget that part
[1:23:20] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:23:22] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:23:24] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:23:26] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:23:28] promises un to you and to your children
[1:23:30] to all that are far off even as many as
[1:23:32] the Lord Our God shall call thank God he
[1:23:34] said that cuz that's us and with many
[1:23:37] other words did he testify and exort
[1:23:39] saying save yourself from this wicked or
[1:23:42] UNT generation then they received and
[1:23:44] baptized same day they were added 3,000
[1:23:47] Souls people were BT 3,000 people were
[1:23:49] baptized and they continued steadfast
[1:23:52] look first church Foundation First
[1:23:56] Church they continued steadfast in the
[1:23:59] apostles Doctrine didn't say Jesus's
[1:24:02] Doctrine because they were Christians
[1:24:05] and they preached what Christ said so
[1:24:06] they didn't differentiate they didn't
[1:24:08] say oh they said no this is the apostles
[1:24:10] Doctrine but it's what Jesus said and
[1:24:12] fellowship and breaking of bread and in
[1:24:15] prayer now Peter on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:19] he was given the keys to the kingdom we
[1:24:20] find that he opened it to the Jews
[1:24:23] on the day of Pentecost went down to
[1:24:24] Samaritan and opened up again so they
[1:24:27] they sent up for him who Peter they had
[1:24:29] the keys and he laid his hand upon them
[1:24:31] the Holy Ghost Came Upon them now we
[1:24:34] Gentiles we were heathens Romans Greeks
[1:24:36] and so forth we worshiped Idols we
[1:24:37] weren't looking for a messiah we had no
[1:24:39] time for messiah we had our own Gods our
[1:24:41] forefathers but the Jews were looking
[1:24:42] for a messiah so when the Samaritans
[1:24:45] because they were half Jew so was the
[1:24:47] Samaritans cuz they were half to and
[1:24:49] Gentile we'll stop right here now Jesus
[1:24:51] will appear to those who are looking for
[1:24:54] him Jesus will appear how profound is
[1:24:57] that quote Jesus will appear to those
[1:25:00] who are looking for him only those
[1:25:03] that's
[1:25:04] all he is not obligated to the
[1:25:09] unbeliever but to the believer he is
[1:25:12] obligated he is obligated to raise the
[1:25:15] believer up see in the last day
[1:25:18] only the
[1:25:21] believer let's stand our feet only
[1:25:25] obligated to a Believer he is not
[1:25:29] obligated oh he's a good god somebody
[1:25:32] was preaching the other
[1:25:33] day and
[1:25:39] uh we call Jesus the prince of
[1:25:42] peace Mighty conqueror all these great
[1:25:45] things oh Jesus you know he's he's just
[1:25:48] a Meek mile guy he's comforting and
[1:25:52] that's what he's going to make
[1:25:54] you Jesus tells us he said I didn't come
[1:25:56] to bring peace but a sword he said
[1:26:00] husband will be against wife wife will
[1:26:02] be against husband mother-in-law again
[1:26:05] he knew that as the church AE Messengers
[1:26:07] that he was going to be in he knew that
[1:26:10] once he sounded his message there would
[1:26:12] be a war and listen when you have a war
[1:26:15] what you got to do first first thing you
[1:26:17] got to
[1:26:18] do pick a
[1:26:20] side cuz there's two that's why they're
[1:26:23] Waring you got to pick a side
[1:26:26] today you got to you can't be neutral
[1:26:30] you got to pick one of the other right
[1:26:32] you might in another Army you might be
[1:26:34] one of them secret centers or something
[1:26:36] but no you got to pick a side God's army
[1:26:39] or the devil's Army one of the
[1:26:40] two and that's what he did on the day of
[1:26:43] Pentecost that's what God said he said I
[1:26:45] come to bring a
[1:26:47] sword I am the Prince of Peace he'll put
[1:26:50] peace in your heart but he'll also turn
[1:26:51] people against you he knew that that's
[1:26:54] why he said what he did and what about
[1:26:57] this before we close this great pen of
[1:27:00] Peace this mild mannered Man From
[1:27:03] Galilee he was sitting eating one day
