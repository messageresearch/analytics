[5:30] I told him last night that if brother
[5:33] dick got out there and got to talking a
[5:34] whole lot they might have a Jonah you
[5:37] know so we'll pray for him
[5:39] he don't try to convert the captain
[5:41] maybe because he might try to throw him
[5:44] overboard and not not making light just

[7:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[7:14] love and your grace and to us we thank
[7:16] you for the day that we have
[7:19] because Lord
[7:20] we truly believe that Faith cometh by
[7:22] hearing and hearing by the word
[7:25] and we believe that we've gathered this
[7:27] day for that purpose
[7:28] that you would speak to our hearts and
[7:31] reveal yourself unto us Lord forgive our
[7:34] sins guide us in your loving grace be
[7:37] with Wade there as he's administering
[7:39] this morning just be with him and father
[7:41] just bless each one you said in your
[7:44] word that you sent your word and healed
[7:46] us that we just remind you of that Lord
[7:49] and father the promises are yea and amen
[7:53] so as we speak the word you come and
[7:56] override to human inabilities that we
[7:59] have and be able to speak
[8:02] enough to do as a prophet said to maybe
[8:05] break the spell over the people's eyes
[8:07] that Satan has placed our and be able to
[8:11] allow you to speak to our hearts we love
[8:14] you and we thank you we ask you to just
[8:17] bless us and forgive us and keep us in
[8:20] Jesus name
[8:21] amen
[8:23] Romans 8.
[8:25] 28.
[8:28] we'll try this afternoon if we can get
[8:30] through to have questions and answers
[8:32] you know or questions comments Etc uh
[8:35] this afternoon so you'd be thinking
[8:38] about it and uh you know getting
[8:40] everything ready we'll try to have that
[8:43] this afternoon
[8:44] I hope to bring this to a conclusion as
[8:49] say the the study we've been making but
[8:53] yet not bring it to an end as to all
[8:55] things because what we'll do is we'll
[8:58] wind up oh
[9:00] picking there's some points that I've
[9:03] covered a little bit that I want to go
[9:05] back and cover
[9:06] all right and you know in doings and
[9:09] some separate sermons and things like
[9:11] that okay pray at the Lord would bless
[9:13] us Romans 8 28 and we know that all
[9:16] things work together for good to them
[9:18] that love God to them who are the called
[9:20] according to his purpose
[9:22] for whom he did for no he also did
[9:24] predestinate to be conformed to the
[9:27] image of his son that he might be the
[9:30] firstborn among many brethren
[9:32] moreover whom he did now once did
[9:35] already
[9:36] predestinate them he also already called
[9:42] in whom he called them he also already
[9:45] finished Justified
[9:47] in whom he justified then he also
[9:50] glorified as far as God is concerned
[9:53] it's all past tense right
[9:57] so then if we ever get the revelation of
[9:59] what it is then we convert very easily
[10:01] take the next verse what shall we then
[10:04] say to these things
[10:06] if God be for us
[10:08] who can be against us
[10:10] amen
[10:12] let's go over to Ephesians 1.
[10:19] verse 1 Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ
[10:22] by the will of God to the Saints which
[10:24] are at emphasis and to the faithful in
[10:26] Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace
[10:29] from God our Father and from the Lord
[10:30] Jesus Christ
[10:32] blessed be the God and father of our
[10:34] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[10:35] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[10:39] places in Christ
[10:41] and watch according as he hath chosen Us
[10:43] in him
[10:45] that did he choose us and just pick us
[10:48] out no it's chosen in him before the
[10:53] foundation of the world
[10:55] that we see should be holding Without
[10:58] Blame before him in love having
[11:00] predestinated us I got these circles but
[11:04] I like that that's to me you know
[11:07] having predestinated us unto the
[11:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[11:11] himself according to the good pleasure
[11:13] of his will to the praise of the glory
[11:15] of his grace wherein he hath made what
[11:17] US accepted in the blood in whom we have
[11:21] Redemption through his blood to
[11:22] forgiveness of sins
[11:24] that according to the riches of his
[11:26] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[11:28] in all wisdom and prudence
[11:30] having made known unto us right
[11:34] the mystery of his will according to his
[11:36] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[11:38] himself
[11:40] then in the dispensation of the fullness
[11:42] of times he might gather together in one
[11:45] all things in Christ both which are in
[11:48] heaven and which are on earth even in
[11:50] him
[11:51] now remember chosen in him
[11:55] now you're going to bring everything
[11:59] is coming into his captivity right
[12:03] in whom also we have obtained an
[12:05] inheritance being predestinated
[12:08] according to the purpose of him who work
[12:10] of all things after the counsel of his
[12:12] own will that we right should be to
[12:15] should be to the praise of his glory
[12:18] which first trusted in Christ
[12:20] in whom ye also trusted what after that
[12:25] you heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[12:28] of your salvation
[12:30] in whom also after you believed you were
[12:35] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[12:37] with that excuse me that notice it
[12:41] I don't know whether only one of them
[12:44] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[12:46] until the Redemption of the purchased
[12:48] possession unto the praise of his glory
[12:52] you may be seated Lord that is blessing
[12:54] to the reading of the word
[13:00] now we're predestinated unto
[13:03] the point
[13:04] of full
[13:06] inheritance
[13:08] right
[13:09] okay now
[13:13] I've been speaking and I said I want to
[13:15] try to bring it to a kind of a
[13:17] conclusion this morning and all but I
[13:21] won't end all of it I will pick some
[13:23] points and go back through
[13:25] and you be sure and have your questions
[13:27] for this afternoon turn them in or we
[13:31] will have open discussion
[13:33] now I believe to understand
[13:39] the way that the Bible would speak that
[13:41] we were chosen in him
[13:46] that
[13:47] uh not chosen of him
[13:52] but chosen in him
[13:54] all right then
[13:56] to understand the prophet and his way of
[14:00] speaking
[14:01] of a
[14:04] of a seed being in you
[14:07] and you were born with a seed in you
[14:12] and
[14:14] could even call those things eternal
[14:17] life
[14:19] and say
[14:21] if you have eternal life
[14:23] you always was eternal
[14:26] well now that's not you and I
[14:28] God first off
[14:30] we had to be chosen
[14:33] right
[14:35] second off there's only one eternal
[14:38] and that's his own life
[14:41] all right so then we we can understand
[14:43] and follow to me I wrote it down the
[14:46] other day like this to me this is the
[14:48] key of understanding is this statement I
[14:51] tried the things I tried to bring out
[14:53] Wednesday
[14:55] trying to preach that God will not dwell
[14:59] in an unclean vessel
[15:03] see people believe they come into the
[15:05] world with eternal life in them
[15:11] within where was God dwelling
[15:15] that's all I'm asking I'm you know
[15:18] I don't like to be a smart alec
[15:21] I've been labeled one
[15:24] I'm not very smart so I guess I might be
[15:26] an addict
[15:27] whatever how you want to Define that but
[15:33] I've tried my best for 40 something
[15:35] years
[15:37] to preach when I believe
[15:40] is the truth
[15:42] of the hour
[15:44] and I've tried to take
[15:48] even a lot of things that were seemingly
[15:51] in the message that sounded
[15:54] contradictory
[15:56] and I've tried my you know tried to
[15:58] yield myself to the Lord to get an
[16:01] answer
[16:02] and to this day he has never failed me
[16:05] to give me an answer about things you
[16:09] know that would be questionable as we
[16:12] look at it and read
[16:13] uh you know we were going to a
[16:16] Minister's meeting one time on marriage
[16:18] and divorce you've heard me tell of it
[16:20] and
[16:22] I'd always been concerned about during
[16:24] Deuteronomy where it talks about that uh
[16:27] you know a man finding someone cleaning
[16:28] his wife and he put her away
[16:31] and uh you know and things like that and
[16:34] he said she can or may or whatever is
[16:36] using during the terminologies
[16:39] it sounds exactly like God said it's
[16:41] okay for her to go get married again you
[16:43] know the wet sounds well that's what
[16:45] they brought up when we got to the
[16:46] ministers meeting well
[16:48] I was honest and praying and I do when I
[16:51] seek this out I I lay before him I don't
[16:54] try to figure it out
[16:56] I try to wait
[16:58] for him to answer it and it was over in
[17:00] the corner here praying before we left
[17:03] and the Lord showed me what that
[17:05] scripture was
[17:06] he's not okay in it he's just saying she
[17:09] will
[17:11] he's not saying it's okay for her to do
[17:13] it he's saying she will do it all right
[17:15] and uh see that I've always done that
[17:19] and that's why that I can stand the day
[17:22] and say that you know out on the
[17:24] internet systems it never were if I'm
[17:27] wrong come and show me because I want to
[17:30] be right
[17:31] this is not a thing of uh building a
[17:35] kingdom
[17:36] I got so tickled we they gave us a
[17:41] I think Hannah was the one that bought
[17:43] it or something or got him for her daddy
[17:45] but we were viewing the uh video the
[17:48] other day which talked about how that
[17:51] the men that made America and is talking
[17:54] about uh
[17:56] Rockefeller and uh
[17:59] you know
[18:01] Morgan and and uh
[18:04] the different ones like that that were
[18:07] the super rich
[18:09] you know
[18:10] well
[18:11] when I finished up I began to kind of
[18:14] laugh and
[18:16] looked over at my wife and she'd you
[18:18] know we do that a lot we take naps
[18:20] sometimes when we doing things and
[18:23] when she woke up I said honey you missed
[18:26] the best part
[18:27] then what
[18:28] the especially Rockefeller and Morgan
[18:31] when they got down in their old age
[18:35] coming to the end of the life maybe some
[18:37] of you seen the video about it so
[18:40] their concern was the hereafter
[18:43] so they figured if they gave away ever a
[18:46] lot here
[18:47] they might get Hereafter you know
[18:50] and they said Rockefeller equivalent to
[18:53] this day is money that was you know
[18:56] 1890s 1900s
[18:59] somewhere thereabouts
[19:01] it'd be equivalent to him giving away
[19:03] over a hundred billion dollars
[19:07] to Charities and things
[19:09] he trying to pay his way into heaven
[19:13] go these scene he wouldn't go nowhere
[19:15] without
[19:16] he wasn't going to start new companies
[19:19] he better be concerned about
[19:21] you know Hereafter well
[19:25] you know
[19:28] that's me I'm not concerned with
[19:30] anything
[19:31] here
[19:33] I'm concerned with a hereafter
[19:36] all right I hope you are because that's
[19:38] what we better be concerned with is the
[19:41] things of doing you know
[19:44] but I'm just I've always just tried to
[19:46] be honest and say okay if I'm wrong come
[19:48] and show me
[19:50] because if I am wrong and I have the
[19:53] Holy Ghost I will take correction
[19:56] but if I'm not wrong then I'm not going
[19:58] to belittle you because you don't
[20:01] believe what I believe
[20:03] because I really remember one thing the
[20:06] scripture said all you have you received
[20:11] you didn't get it yourself you received
[20:14] it and I'm a firm believer in faith
[20:17] cometh by hearing
[20:20] and hearing by the word and I've asked
[20:22] you over and over and I've asked the
[20:23] people of the message they say we come
[20:26] here with this eternal seat I believe
[20:27] what brother random is talking about
[20:30] but I asked a simple question
[20:33] the new birth is it the birth that once
[20:35] you come here with
[20:37] versus the birth of what you got after
[20:40] you got here by faith that you heard
[20:42] that's all I've asked
[20:45] simple questions
[20:46] but see people don't want to no that's
[20:48] this question gender Strife we want to
[20:51] preach it you know okay praise the Lord
[20:55] I'm just going down the road
[20:58] you know I ain't worried about it
[21:02] but you see Church
[21:03] I believe that God will not dwell
[21:06] in an unclean vessel
[21:08] I believe he spent too much time in the
[21:11] Bible declaring how those vessels must
[21:14] be clean
[21:16] how they must be washed
[21:18] even burnout or whatever you know we'd
[21:21] get down to brother Branham
[21:23] so if the Bible and brother Reynolds
[21:25] spent a lot of talking about
[21:26] unclean vessels not being used
[21:30] then how can you put
[21:32] eternal life
[21:34] inside the soul of an individual that is
[21:38] lost
[21:44] all right
[21:46] but I made my point over and over and
[21:49] over to you
[21:51] just as we read from the prophet
[21:55] hey not to your own understanding
[21:57] excuse me now wait a minute the
[21:59] invisible Union
[22:02] where he said the seed of God can't be
[22:04] in you
[22:06] at the same time the world is there
[22:10] but see we don't want those quotes
[22:13] we want to think about something dire
[22:18] and then you start thinking about
[22:21] whale
[22:23] he loved me
[22:25] and he put it there
[22:28] and I'm anointed
[22:32] praise the Lord
[22:35] like I was telling them last night
[22:36] coming home
[22:38] and remember the incident that happened
[22:40] where this brother
[22:42] made a remark about somebody
[22:44] well see his discernment could have
[22:46] picked that up
[22:49] but I told him he was wrong
[22:55] because even though his discernment
[22:57] might have been close
[23:01] first off he didn't have sensible use of
[23:04] it but second off
[23:06] it wasn't correct
[23:11] we see Church
[23:12] we can be so anointed so
[23:15] you know
[23:18] until
[23:21] nobody's going to be able to help us
[23:25] was that what the prophet said on that
[23:27] note that not I believe it is about the
[23:29] little woman
[23:30] he said you couldn't tell her
[23:32] wrong to do them thing why I said oh
[23:36] she's anointed
[23:38] well you know you say well you don't
[23:39] believe in being a
[23:41] I believe we must be anointed
[23:44] I believe the anointing is what teaches
[23:47] us
[23:50] but remember anointing on your spirit
[23:54] as the prophet has covered anointed ones
[23:57] is a hard situation
[24:00] to let him teach us
[24:06] but I believe in the true genuine
[24:07] anointing don't you Brother Dean gave me
[24:10] a quote while ago that I'll just read
[24:12] one of them to you about that
[24:15] where brother Brown says on a message
[24:17] called
[24:18] having conferences 1960 608 so you say
[24:23] let's let the preacher do it
[24:27] what a lot of people think right
[24:29] he said this is an individual of Fire
[24:33] it is with every one of us
[24:36] the preacher must do his part
[24:38] he might pray and get his soul blessed
[24:41] and stay all afternoon
[24:43] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[24:46] to walk into the presence of his
[24:48] congregation anointed
[24:50] feeling the power of God
[24:53] but unless that congregation
[24:56] has stayed in the same way
[25:00] it makes a difference
[25:02] he's got to get the congregation under
[25:04] condition
[25:06] but then if the congregation is ready to
[25:08] meet the Holy Spirit then
[25:10] I'll tell you Sinners will whip their
[25:13] way to Calvary
[25:15] if we can just if we can just take it as
[25:19] an individual
[25:21] you're just as responsible as any of
[25:24] these ministers God's going to hold you
[25:28] as an individual responsible
[25:31] right
[25:34] what did the prophet say
[25:36] one person
[25:39] in a congregation
[25:42] caused a whole congregation to fail
[25:48] and all that takes is just a bad
[25:49] attitude
[25:53] brother way you remember presented
[25:56] brother random saying something
[25:59] amen right
[26:01] and he died
[26:04] but see we don't think about that of the
[26:06] days when it come that the center won't
[26:08] be able to sit in the congregation of
[26:10] the righteous
[26:12] we don't think that away we think we're
[26:15] so holy and and everything until
[26:18] we've got it all right
[26:21] but now listen
[26:26] my point I've tried to make is one thing
[26:30] if we make the seed of God
[26:34] we know the seed of God is the word of
[26:36] God right
[26:38] we know in Matthew that a story went
[26:40] forth and so deceived
[26:42] well now brother Randall would say it
[26:45] what
[26:47] see we we say when we come into the
[26:49] world with a seed in it I believe what
[26:51] he's saying
[26:53] I just don't believe what our people's
[26:55] interpretation is of it
[26:57] well I said what he said yeah
[27:00] and in Matthew 28 19.
[27:04] it says for you to go baptize in the
[27:07] name of the father
[27:08] and it was done and the Holy Ghost
[27:12] right
[27:14] that's what the Bible says
[27:18] and you know we've done that
[27:21] from the time the Catholic Church picked
[27:23] it up and injected it
[27:28] but you know then we found out the
[27:30] prophet said the only way you can be
[27:32] baptized in the name of the father and
[27:34] the son the Holy Ghost is to be baptized
[27:36] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:39] did that erase the scripture
[27:42] no
[27:46] we believed hell was eternal when we had
[27:48] scripture for it the worm died not
[27:56] burn Everlasting
[27:59] we had it all figured out
[28:02] the prophet didn't change the Bible
[28:06] he just told us that wasn't correct
[28:10] you see
[28:13] it was a lot of things in the message
[28:18] and instead of taking all that said
[28:21] like I said Wednesday night about Daniel
[28:23] 70 weeks what
[28:29] Serena high for seven and one is this
[28:33] but instead of letting the Holy Spirit
[28:35] speak to us
[28:37] we get what we believe or what Nanny
[28:39] believed or granny believed or preacher
[28:42] believed or somebody believed
[28:44] and we stand on it that away
[28:47] so is it with talking about the seed
[28:50] dwelling in US we've been told
[28:54] that
[28:56] we come here with a seed in US
[29:00] well all right
[29:04] as the prophet asked a simple question
[29:06] remember
[29:09] when was that seed put in you
[29:14] well what do you mean it putting me when
[29:17] I was born
[29:18] no he didn't say that
[29:23] he said it was put in you before the
[29:25] foundation world
[29:29] well all right what part or what is it
[29:33] of anything of you and I before the
[29:36] foundation of the world
[29:40] when the prophet said we wasn't even
[29:41] spirits there was nothing
[29:44] that was only in his mind
[29:49] we were just in his thinking he said
[29:53] he said we're attributes of God's
[29:56] thinking
[29:57] well then we've been through it over and
[29:59] over this is 59 sermons of what
[30:08] does God have just a literal type of
[30:10] seed
[30:14] does he have to come down when the
[30:16] baby's born and put that seed in there
[30:21] like Illustrated Wednesday
[30:24] the two Soul people
[30:29] they believe
[30:31] that when you're born as a baby Satan is
[30:34] sitting there waiting
[30:35] to put a soul in you
[30:39] and I asked him a simple question
[30:42] said Satan beat God there and he put
[30:45] that soul
[30:46] and then God comes along behind you know
[30:51] and he puts his soul I said Ain't It
[30:54] Funny looked like somewhere down the
[30:56] line with all of his infinite wisdom he
[30:59] would have been able to beat the devil
[31:01] at least one time
[31:04] let's see that's sarcastic
[31:09] you're not preaching by revelation
[31:14] but is it the truth
[31:21] if that seed was put in you and I before
[31:24] the foundation world and that's what
[31:26] your Prophet said
[31:28] and he asked the question when was it
[31:30] put there
[31:31] he said before the foundational when was
[31:33] your name written in the last book of
[31:35] life
[31:36] he said before the foundation of the
[31:39] world
[31:40] all right
[31:43] what was back before the foundation were
[31:45] you and I
[31:48] you're into the Mormon doctrine of
[31:50] pre-existence
[31:58] well see we don't want that we want
[32:00] something
[32:02] fast preaching where we can haul and
[32:05] scream
[32:11] but do we pay attention to what we hear
[32:16] not throwing off when the man's message
[32:18] like I'd enjoyed it
[32:20] was coming home some of the people began
[32:22] to say didn't he say so and so
[32:28] I said yeah
[32:31] well what do you think
[32:33] I said well
[32:36] I think he said what he meant
[32:39] well see I was glad that they heard it
[32:41] without me having to get in the bus did
[32:43] y'all hear all them wrongs
[32:47] no
[32:49] and it wasn't that much it was just
[32:51] little points
[32:54] you know some thoughts he had and that's
[32:57] his business
[33:02] but
[33:04] have we been trained long enough to be
[33:07] able to
[33:09] let the Holy Spirit
[33:12] and you remember the Holy Spirit doesn't
[33:14] have anything to fight with unless you
[33:16] bring him the word
[33:18] yeah
[33:21] you know you got to bring it to him
[33:25] see that's all I've tried to say about
[33:27] throughout this series
[33:29] of the foreknowledge and how that right
[33:31] around the city doesn't predestinate my
[33:33] desires he predestinates by his
[33:35] foreknowledge
[33:40] and remember the point of what we were
[33:41] bringing out
[33:43] for knowledge is fur
[33:46] you remember two or three sermons on
[33:48] that
[33:49] it's not predestination first
[33:53] those who he foreknew
[33:55] he did predestinate
[34:00] so foreknowledge is first
[34:04] foreknowledge is knowledge before of
[34:07] what will come right
[34:09] so does God have to put
[34:12] something in you
[34:13] or is that foreknowledge that he has
[34:16] enough
[34:19] to be able to hold us
[34:22] that he knew one day you would sit and
[34:26] hear the word
[34:28] I read the Bible
[34:30] or turn on the tape
[34:32] or whatever see
[34:35] and you would hear it
[34:39] but it's just like
[34:42] they were talking to a man one time
[34:43] about
[34:45] this seed being there
[34:48] and I made a simple statement I said
[34:50] well
[34:51] brother Branham said that
[34:55] even Mary heard from her mother Anna
[35:00] you know
[35:02] boy he lit in on me
[35:07] I'm tired of this old mother
[35:09] doctrine that y'all are preaching
[35:13] pastor and I were looking at each other
[35:15] you know
[35:18] he said
[35:19] that's old Catholic Doctrine got it from
[35:21] her mama
[35:25] it's what your Prophet said
[35:30] and we'll get down to it in a little
[35:31] while and the woman at the whale
[35:33] remember she said
[35:34] we know
[35:38] she had heard it from somewhere
[35:41] because I still believe Faith cometh by
[35:44] hearing
[35:45] I don't believe you can get it without
[35:47] hearing
[35:49] well rest God I've got it myself
[35:51] come on
[35:53] if you read it somebody said it
[35:57] and the Bible's still right Faith cometh
[35:59] by hearing
[36:04] but you see
[36:07] why it's so important then
[36:11] the kind of word we hear
[36:16] the kind of seed that is sown
[36:21] have you been with me on that in a
[36:23] series
[36:24] so important
[36:25] so how can a preacher preach
[36:29] and how can we hear the Bible says
[36:30] without a preacher
[36:33] and then he says but how can the
[36:35] preacher preach unless that preacher be
[36:37] sin of God in other words
[36:39] right
[36:40] so if he's not sin of God
[36:43] somebody else sent him might have been
[36:46] mama daddy or the devil now remember the
[36:49] Bible says the devil has
[36:52] angels of light
[36:55] that our Ministers of righteousness the
[36:58] Bible says they're not even law teachers
[37:02] because the devil don't like law
[37:03] teachers
[37:07] he wants it all into Grace
[37:12] but then
[37:15] if we're born with so much in US
[37:18] why do we need the prophet to come
[37:24] I didn't need to profit to come and
[37:26] bring
[37:28] we need the message of the hour of
[37:30] course now a lot of Sinner don't need it
[37:34] the ones that brought some of us into
[37:36] the message and I ain't talking about
[37:37] maybe a year but a lot of times the ones
[37:40] that taught us in our early days what
[37:43] are they now
[37:46] where are they at
[37:49] but you see church we in the day we are
[37:52] in the day of manifestation
[37:54] and you and I are going to manifest what
[37:57] we are
[37:59] and it's like I told them last night
[38:01] some of them
[38:02] and we're getting pretty old
[38:05] and I told them not in the meeting but
[38:07] outside
[38:09] I told some of the brothers I said if we
[38:11] don't hurry up and get out of here and
[38:13] rapture
[38:14] we're going to be having Fellowship
[38:15] meetings in the nursing home
[38:21] and about right
[38:23] and I'm not throwing off on nobody in
[38:26] the nursing home but we're going to be
[38:27] saying hey what do you say
[38:31] he said Trinity's right
[38:33] you know
[38:37] shake you loose
[38:38] all right
[38:42] but you see why it's so important what
[38:44] kind of a seed to this song
[38:47] now brother random words original seeded
[38:49] I ask you to listen to
[38:51] he talks about the denomination so I
[38:54] want to see Billy Graham or Robertson
[38:56] today so deceit what the Bible
[39:02] come on you want the quote from him
[39:06] he said but the word has been sown pure
[39:08] in an unadulterated something to that
[39:11] degree
[39:13] apart from man's Creed by who
[39:17] him
[39:19] and with nobody else right him
[39:22] all right see we had to have the message
[39:25] to be able to turn us back
[39:30] to even the thoughts
[39:33] then he emphasizes we were listening to
[39:35] a tape the other day but around the
[39:37] emphasizes Galatians 1 8 where if an
[39:40] angel come from Heaven you know and
[39:41] bring anything
[39:42] he said see there
[39:44] he said if that angel comes and tells
[39:46] you something
[39:47] until you come from heaven
[39:49] he said let him be accursed
[39:53] of course now we got a lot of angels
[39:56] because everybody's wanting to lead
[39:58] right
[40:02] into raising up with their doctrines
[40:05] but listen now be sensible
[40:12] if that word was sewn into our hearts or
[40:15] whatever
[40:20] when we hear it
[40:23] so then it's very vital to hear the word
[40:26] in it correctly
[40:28] see that's your responsibility
[40:33] it's your responsibility to find out
[40:35] what it's right or not
[40:38] it's my responsibility to preach it
[40:40] okay
[40:43] but then
[40:46] knowing that God can't Quicken
[40:51] a false Doctrine
[40:54] Lord reveal to me a trinity
[40:56] now
[40:58] there's no such thing
[41:06] but then if we believe that we must hear
[41:08] the word
[41:11] and we believe Faith cometh by hearing
[41:14] and then we say well the prophet said
[41:16] the seed was sown before the foundation
[41:19] were amen
[41:22] and all of that was in God's mind
[41:27] in his mind he looked down through time
[41:32] and he saw that Jesus Christ would die
[41:34] upon a cross right
[41:37] so we could go ahead and write it down
[41:39] because as far as he's concerned
[41:40] remember
[41:41] it was already finished
[41:45] that's why people don't understand about
[41:47] brother Branham that was the that was
[41:49] the thing that caught me
[41:53] was a man talking about something
[41:55] present tense
[41:58] we talked to what was and talked what
[42:00] will be
[42:03] and then we found out the prophet said
[42:05] that's the problem with man right
[42:07] looking back looking forward
[42:09] never looking at what's happening
[42:13] see that was a thing when I heard him
[42:15] talking about the Bible he made the
[42:18] Bible become alive to me now
[42:23] present tense
[42:26] I could see it
[42:30] I'm not talking about you remember I
[42:32] told you what 30 years ago maybe
[42:35] I said
[42:36] I'll quit trying to go to heaven
[42:40] I'll try to tell you don't want to go to
[42:42] heaven I didn't say that I said I'd quit
[42:44] trying to go
[42:46] well you know what I found out
[42:48] heaven was coming here
[42:52] run around and say I'm not saying he's
[42:55] coming
[42:58] saying I'm saying he's here
[43:02] well you know what
[43:05] I don't mind saying it
[43:07] he was the only person in the world that
[43:09] believed that
[43:11] at that time
[43:14] why
[43:16] because he's the only person that was
[43:17] revealed to
[43:19] right
[43:21] see when a prophet sees something you
[43:23] remember Isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[43:29] you know what
[43:30] that was real
[43:33] to him that was reality
[43:35] but maybe five minutes later he's
[43:37] walking off and he said what in the
[43:40] world did I say
[43:43] why he lost the reality
[43:46] but God's thought it already been
[43:48] presented
[43:50] it was made in the word
[43:53] so I wrote a random speaks positive
[43:59] he said one time like this
[44:01] he said we don't see you no more please
[44:04] maybe he said if I don't see he said if
[44:06] I don't see you no more
[44:08] he said I'll see you in the future home
[44:13] you ever heard him talk like that
[44:16] well you know what there's a Rapture a
[44:19] tribulation
[44:21] a thousand year
[44:23] millennium a white Throne judgment and
[44:26] then a future home
[44:29] I guess next things
[44:31] it's your home
[44:38] even though his words were there
[44:40] that was not what he said
[44:44] well you're a dummy you don't believe
[44:46] what I say it
[44:49] I think about what he said
[44:54] he said you always was eternal
[44:59] then that means you're God
[45:04] any problem
[45:07] the only one is eternal
[45:12] but now when he said if you have eternal
[45:14] life
[45:19] you always was eternal vast difference
[45:24] one of them is God himself
[45:27] as God transmitted down to you and how
[45:30] was he transmitted down
[45:35] by Calvary
[45:38] God himself had to give his own life
[45:43] before eternal life could come into
[45:45] anybody
[45:48] but you see that's the point that we do
[45:52] we take a little woman at the whale and
[45:54] we say
[45:55] and I've got them laying right here if
[45:56] you want me to read them I'm just going
[45:58] to try to preach it
[45:59] and we say
[46:02] that little woman at the well when she
[46:03] heard Jesus
[46:05] said that word was quick unto her to
[46:07] come alive
[46:09] amen
[46:14] but she had to go to the upper room to
[46:17] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:19] and the Bible said
[46:21] that the Holy Ghost had not been given
[46:24] right
[46:25] because Jesus had not been crucified
[46:29] how could she get eternal life
[46:32] before Calvary
[46:35] and I made the statement and I know it
[46:37] goes over flat to most people
[46:39] nobody in the Old Testament had eternal
[46:42] life
[46:47] if they did what was they doing in
[46:48] Paradise
[46:50] why was not the up in glory
[46:54] simple but yet that doesn't go through
[46:56] people's brains
[46:58] what do you mean they wouldn't
[47:00] say I never said that
[47:04] but but brother now you didn't I never
[47:06] said they wasn't saved
[47:08] play the take back
[47:13] a lot of difference being saved and have
[47:15] an eternal life
[47:19] you show me how they could be
[47:21] Eternal in the Old Testament
[47:24] you show me how even the disciples could
[47:27] be Eternal without Calvary you show me
[47:29] how you can be Eternal without Calvary
[47:34] I'll put a sign on my back and walk the
[47:36] streets of Louis I'm a false prophet and
[47:38] shut this place down why because I've
[47:41] missed all of it
[47:43] I don't mind saying that
[47:48] but you see
[47:49] before the foundation of the world it
[47:52] was only in God's mind
[47:55] not a reality
[47:59] real to God
[48:03] well brother Dale I'm just now beginning
[48:05] to feel like I was back there what are
[48:08] you feeling it from
[48:10] what you do like Napoleon
[48:13] you remember Napoleon thought he existed
[48:16] in other words you know
[48:19] that's being a silly brother Dale is it
[48:25] you remember the quote run around and
[48:26] said I'm not doing this to
[48:30] how do you straighten out how to bring a
[48:33] dog he said I'm doing this to straighten
[48:34] out a doctor
[48:37] I didn't bring this series to try to
[48:39] make a doctrine of predestination
[48:43] but to show you and I how far we miss it
[48:47] yeah but my Lord Brother Dale you've
[48:49] preached 59 sermons I've done for God
[48:52] what she's talking about
[48:55] I'm glad you thought that
[48:59] of course
[49:01] you listen to everything else
[49:06] you want me to name off
[49:10] the tape I preached on
[49:15] my brother Branham was talking about
[49:18] and we were trying to bring out did God
[49:20] have a seed like a literal
[49:23] God don't need a literal seed church he
[49:26] creates
[49:29] remember
[49:31] is not a word
[49:35] until it's spoken
[49:39] God thought it and spoke it it was a
[49:42] reality to him
[49:47] see we're totally denying any Plan of
[49:50] Redemption
[49:54] to try to make some Doctrine
[49:59] and then we use the quotes that Moses
[50:02] at the burning bush
[50:07] and I believe what happened
[50:09] run around and said five minutes at the
[50:11] Burning Bush was worth more than 40
[50:13] years
[50:16] of his mama
[50:18] trying to tell him who he was
[50:21] you remember
[50:25] when little and the blind
[50:28] woman in the Bible that was
[50:30] Mary's mother
[50:35] she told her about Isaiah 9 6.
[50:39] you know the Virgin shall conceived
[50:42] but you know that never quickened a
[50:43] thing to her
[50:45] that angel reminded her of the
[50:48] scriptures
[50:49] I mean we got a two-minute conversation
[50:54] but remember that two-minute
[50:55] conversation covered the entire Old
[50:59] Testament to telling her about who that
[51:01] was going to be
[51:03] right
[51:06] she said
[51:08] he said to her said the Holy Spirit
[51:10] shall overshadow thee
[51:15] Isaiah 9 6 is going to come into your
[51:17] womb she said be it unto me according to
[51:19] Thy Word
[51:22] did that give her eternal life
[51:24] may I quote your prophet
[51:28] he said you call her you people I said
[51:30] you call her the mother of God said
[51:32] Remember the mother of God had to be
[51:33] pulled up in the upper room to receive
[51:35] the Holy Ghost
[51:40] but see we just make eternal life just
[51:42] any kind of a thought
[51:47] it's a person
[51:52] like I told you many years ago I said
[51:54] you wait one of these days they're going
[51:55] to be quoting closer what you think
[51:58] what are they doing now
[52:01] well you don't need to be born again you
[52:04] did what the born-again experience is is
[52:05] you just get a knowledge that you always
[52:07] was
[52:12] well then you didn't need Jesus
[52:15] well he died to bring me a knowledge
[52:19] what
[52:22] how dumb can you get
[52:24] he said but I don't like you in your
[52:25] attitude
[52:27] pray for my attitude
[52:29] but remember a dumb donkey tell you the
[52:31] truth you better amen to truth anyway
[52:36] because you can get trouble with God for
[52:38] not taking his word
[52:41] not my word
[52:43] it's his word
[52:47] if you come into the world with eternal
[52:49] life you didn't need Jesus Christ
[52:53] that's simple but no
[52:56] that brother Dale that's just oh yeah
[52:58] okay
[53:00] 12 28.
[53:03] 2013.
[53:05] part 51 morning and evening
[53:08] I asked a question
[53:10] does God have a literal seed
[53:13] or does he create
[53:16] do you remember that
[53:20] does God have a literal seed or does he
[53:22] create a seed
[53:24] if he creates a seed then evidently it
[53:27] wasn't in existence
[53:29] in reality form
[53:31] remember when I kept emphasizing that
[53:34] Jesus said my words
[53:39] he said they are Spirit in their life
[53:45] there's no man
[53:47] in the world ever been able to say that
[53:50] not even brother random
[53:52] he said oh wait a minute you're not
[53:54] talking like it well brother Brandon was
[53:55] wrong about the one horse rider you
[53:57] solve it with God
[54:01] but you see we want to make him
[54:03] infallible
[54:05] when he told you he was not infallible
[54:14] see we think a literal seed came into me
[54:21] but by God's foreknowledge
[54:23] which is in his mind
[54:26] he's seen when you would receive that
[54:29] word or seed
[54:33] but then you had to hear from somebody
[54:36] because Faith cometh by hearing
[54:41] remember we tried to cover that when God
[54:44] thought of something as far as he was
[54:46] concerned it was already ended
[54:50] right amen
[54:55] but there must be a time of what God
[54:58] thought of
[55:00] comes into reality
[55:02] or else he didn't think of it
[55:07] is that fun enough
[55:10] but the truth
[55:12] if he said something it never comes to
[55:14] pies
[55:15] I heard a big man this message one time
[55:17] and said
[55:19] he said me and Bill talked about
[55:21] scriptures that would never be fulfilled
[55:27] uh I'm sorry I got a little memory
[55:31] and that old computer in my mind went to
[55:34] huge
[55:36] and brother Brown said every scripture
[55:38] has got to be fulfilled
[55:42] well I didn't care what he thought
[55:45] brother Branham said
[55:49] I know brother Branham didn't tell him
[55:51] that
[55:52] you called him a liar no he called
[55:56] himself one
[56:01] all right
[56:08] but when he said throughout the
[56:10] scriptures as we read chosen in him
[56:16] and that we came here with a seed in US
[56:19] why don't you cover that this way
[56:22] where the Prophet said when Jesus Christ
[56:25] came we was what
[56:30] in him
[56:34] right is that right
[56:37] you remember the story of the Bible or
[56:39] that it speaks of
[56:41] Eve
[56:44] was an Adam
[56:46] it didn't talk about Adam being an eve
[56:51] but Eve was an Adam
[56:57] we came here
[57:00] was not human us
[57:04] he came here with us in him
[57:08] when we came here we were lost doomed
[57:11] and on our way to hell
[57:12] now you're going to take that loss and
[57:15] doomed and on the way to hell and put
[57:17] eternal life over here beside it when
[57:19] you get to the judgment
[57:20] what are you going to do
[57:25] some part of you got to go to hell
[57:33] sorry
[57:38] what you see if I can believe
[57:41] that he came here with me and him
[57:45] then he went to hell and I went with him
[57:50] right
[57:51] it's all taken care of
[57:53] because he paid the price
[57:56] I don't have to worry about it
[57:59] but you see church if we can believe
[58:01] that we're in his mind
[58:05] not realities the little spots or little
[58:08] peoples or something running around
[58:09] little Souls
[58:14] then we can look down and say
[58:16] thank you Lord
[58:24] look
[58:27] I said we talk about the little woman
[58:30] but around said she was predestinated to
[58:33] eternal life
[58:36] and he said that little seed that would
[58:39] lay in there
[58:41] he said it come alive
[58:46] well that's true
[58:48] but what was that little seed
[58:51] she said we know when the Messiah cometh
[58:56] and what did he say I am he is that what
[59:00] he said
[59:02] did that give her eternal life
[59:07] if she got eternal life
[59:09] by that then Jesus didn't have to die
[59:12] for her
[59:15] and when Moses at the burning bush
[59:18] it was quicker than Moses he'd heard it
[59:22] all of his life
[59:23] 40 years by his mama
[59:26] right
[59:28] 40 years
[59:30] fighting it out with a hot-headed woman
[59:32] out in the desert
[59:35] don't you think he thought about what
[59:38] had been said about his mama
[59:43] mama told me
[59:45] what kind of
[59:50] but when he met that burning bush
[59:54] he wasn't concerned about what mama said
[59:57] daddy said
[59:59] or anybody say it
[1:00:01] he met the one
[1:00:04] and he knew
[1:00:06] before then he run from Egypt right when
[1:00:09] he could have at least made an
[1:00:10] Insurrection in the government because
[1:00:12] he was leader of the government right
[1:00:16] but something kept me from doing it
[1:00:18] scared
[1:00:20] but when he met that burning bush he
[1:00:22] said
[1:00:25] honey
[1:00:27] you ready to go
[1:00:28] she said where we're going he said we're
[1:00:30] going to Egypt
[1:00:34] they're going down there take over
[1:00:37] she said one two
[1:00:40] three
[1:00:42] and there's an argument back and forth
[1:00:43] whether they had two kids or one you
[1:00:45] know
[1:00:47] still the best they could have had with
[1:00:48] four of them
[1:00:50] and on the way he gets a guy that runs
[1:00:52] into a lot of trouble later on named
[1:00:53] Aaron
[1:00:58] going down to Egypt take over
[1:01:02] it you don't ever think sensibly
[1:01:06] you see why it's so hard to just get on
[1:01:08] one thing
[1:01:11] Pharaoh the Pharaoh that loved Joseph
[1:01:14] was dead
[1:01:16] you remember one raised up that didn't
[1:01:18] know Joseph
[1:01:21] the Pharaoh that loved Moses was dead
[1:01:27] his son that wanted to kill him
[1:01:33] he was the king
[1:01:35] he walked in hey King I'd like to talk
[1:01:37] to you
[1:01:40] well first off he's telling me to just
[1:01:42] go cut his head off because he's the
[1:01:44] wrong approach
[1:01:48] he said who is it out there is a guy
[1:01:51] named Moses
[1:01:55] I didn't figure he'd make it
[1:01:57] he almost taught to you
[1:01:59] okay let him come on you don't think
[1:02:01] that what was his name said to you or
[1:02:03] what his name was when it come on you
[1:02:05] don't think he wasn't afraid of Moses
[1:02:09] I want to sell you some stock in the
[1:02:11] Brooklyn Bridge
[1:02:12] or Alcatraz one
[1:02:15] he was scared to death of Moses because
[1:02:18] he was afraid he had come back and he
[1:02:21] knew Moses could take over the army
[1:02:26] he was scared of him
[1:02:28] besides a guy you've run out in the
[1:02:31] desert and been gone 40 years and you
[1:02:34] give him enough water or life to him
[1:02:35] three days
[1:02:38] you know he's walking back in
[1:02:42] he was scared
[1:02:47] but you see Moses wasn't afraid no more
[1:02:51] does it matter to him
[1:02:54] he didn't care if I Rose whole Army come
[1:02:57] out there
[1:03:00] you know all he had to say
[1:03:02] and I'm not making jokes of it
[1:03:05] you never had a speech impediment China
[1:03:07] they don't emphasize that much in the
[1:03:09] movies you see but
[1:03:11] he said Aaron just speak them out of
[1:03:14] existence
[1:03:16] that's all he had to say it
[1:03:19] why because he come down here to take
[1:03:20] over
[1:03:22] because he met God
[1:03:28] you may have heard of God raising a
[1:03:30] message Church everything but until that
[1:03:33] had that baptism of the Holy Ghost comes
[1:03:36] to give you a new birth
[1:03:38] you're lost
[1:03:42] we're all lost without the new birth
[1:03:45] but yet what do we want just quotes
[1:03:49] Nathaniel
[1:03:51] I guess that's the way you pronounce him
[1:03:55] but Iran said he was predestinated
[1:03:58] into eternal life
[1:04:03] but yet
[1:04:05] even meeting Jesus
[1:04:08] didn't give him eternal life
[1:04:11] the great Peter that we speak of
[1:04:14] it was given the revelation
[1:04:17] the dark the Christ the son of the
[1:04:19] Living God
[1:04:23] that didn't give him eternal life
[1:04:26] he had to go to the upper room
[1:04:29] but see we don't believe that
[1:04:33] see we don't believe
[1:04:34] that you had to receive eternal life to
[1:04:37] have eternal life
[1:04:40] because we've been taught we always was
[1:04:42] eternal we've always wanted Eternal we
[1:04:44] don't need nobody to die we don't need
[1:04:46] nothing we just need a knowledge
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:53] well in the world's got a pretty good
[1:04:54] knowledge and the Devil beats you to it
[1:04:57] and as he says so much sorry
[1:05:02] but that seed was put dire Christ The
[1:05:05] Mystery of God revealed
[1:05:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:15] and we are nothing but when his eyes
[1:05:17] were open 64. but attributes of God's
[1:05:21] thinking
[1:05:25] we're a display of what he thought of
[1:05:29] you remember Wednesday what we were
[1:05:30] bringing somebody had to represent us
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:37] somebody perfect
[1:05:40] according to paragraph 131
[1:05:43] a broken sister in 1964.
[1:05:46] someone perfect
[1:05:48] and to Representatives
[1:05:53] the scripture calls him an advocate
[1:05:57] which is Jesus Christ the righteous
[1:06:00] the Bible says
[1:06:02] an advocate is one who pleads another's
[1:06:05] cause
[1:06:09] an advocate
[1:06:10] someone who stands between
[1:06:14] brother random says
[1:06:16] paragraph 257
[1:06:18] up to 250 to 60 of the future home I'd
[1:06:23] invite you to read
[1:06:25] let's cover that in a hurry okay go down
[1:06:27] 14.
[1:06:29] I'm sorry Wednesday night I I said the
[1:06:31] brothers had fallen behind back there
[1:06:33] they were falling way behind on my nose
[1:06:35] because I didn't give them the quotes
[1:06:39] I found them on the printer
[1:06:44] I'm sorry Brothers I wouldn't
[1:06:47] you know I didn't blame y'all I found
[1:06:49] out I was the one to blame I left the
[1:06:52] quote on the printer so it's kind of
[1:06:54] hard for them to get them because they
[1:06:56] was running around hunting
[1:06:58] because they're chilling
[1:06:59] Brother Anderson telling me telling me
[1:07:02] later they were trying to fight where's
[1:07:04] it at I don't know where's that
[1:07:07] is on the printer
[1:07:09] but look what he says
[1:07:13] future home
[1:07:15] look at the priest
[1:07:18] wasn't he a son of God
[1:07:20] it proved it wasn't
[1:07:23] he couldn't recognize what
[1:07:25] you say I believe the Bible sure
[1:07:28] but he couldn't recognize the express
[1:07:30] word of God or the hour
[1:07:31] he only had an intellectual learning
[1:07:33] from some group that had been back
[1:07:35] before him that's a pretty good guy
[1:07:39] right
[1:07:43] and it's the same today I know that's
[1:07:45] strong but it's true that was a word
[1:07:48] that's spoken exactly for the day
[1:07:50] and yet he was a scholar yet he was a
[1:07:53] renowned person but he could not
[1:07:55] recognize it why
[1:07:56] no matter how scholarly he was anything
[1:07:59] like that he still didn't have
[1:08:01] representation
[1:08:04] of predestination
[1:08:08] in other words God saw he wouldn't want
[1:08:10] it right that's simple
[1:08:13] only the predestinated will be the one
[1:08:15] who does it
[1:08:16] only can be and you can only do it
[1:08:19] because look it proves predestination
[1:08:21] because if you've got eternal life
[1:08:23] you had to be a part of God at all times
[1:08:25] because he's the only one he's Eternal
[1:08:28] you see it oh my
[1:08:29] now if you've got eternal life you're
[1:08:31] part of God
[1:08:33] if you come here with eternal life
[1:08:34] without a new birth that makes you
[1:08:36] almighty God
[1:08:39] the god of Glory
[1:08:41] when the bride of Christ is not the god
[1:08:43] of Glory she's the god of Glory
[1:08:45] manifested in another form called a
[1:08:48] bride
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:55] what do we think
[1:08:57] he had no representation of
[1:08:59] predestination
[1:09:01] number 15. paragraph 130.
[1:09:06] through 132.
[1:09:09] now look at this priest here we find his
[1:09:11] bottom part here his back life back
[1:09:14] behind him his predestination back here
[1:09:17] is sinful
[1:09:18] now what's he talking about
[1:09:20] did God predestinate anybody to go to
[1:09:23] hell
[1:09:24] did he predetermine predestinate
[1:09:27] anybody
[1:09:29] to be lost
[1:09:30] the prophet said he didn't
[1:09:34] the Bible said he would at all be saved
[1:09:39] his predestination back here is sinful
[1:09:44] because God knew it
[1:09:45] right in case I missed it brother Brown
[1:09:47] said see all that was black we'll
[1:09:51] probably read it again
[1:09:52] what made it black
[1:09:57] because God knew no matter how religious
[1:10:00] he'd be
[1:10:01] did he turn down Jesus Christ
[1:10:05] right
[1:10:07] come on
[1:10:09] his predestination back here is sinful
[1:10:11] here is hell down here so evidently his
[1:10:14] predestination comes from were
[1:10:19] now this little part in here that looks
[1:10:21] like the Blackboard that represents his
[1:10:24] purity
[1:10:25] he was a priest he was an honorable man
[1:10:27] that represents this he was also had to
[1:10:31] be a good man or he couldn't be a priest
[1:10:33] but you see how he got it was
[1:10:36] intellectually intellectual learning now
[1:10:39] this little woman
[1:10:40] her first life up here she was a
[1:10:44] prostitute she was all marred up
[1:10:47] but way down in her here
[1:10:50] was just a little bit of understanding
[1:10:54] and watch it
[1:10:55] I know when the Messiah cometh now
[1:10:57] where'd she get that
[1:11:00] somebody told her
[1:11:02] all right remember the little woman was
[1:11:05] from over there where the the uh they
[1:11:08] were in in line of inheritance with the
[1:11:10] Jews you remember what would it more
[1:11:12] about his children is that right if I
[1:11:15] get that wrong you put it in the right
[1:11:16] in other words that was it was Israel
[1:11:18] and then this group of people was
[1:11:19] looking for the Messiah but then the
[1:11:22] Gentiles wasn't looking for nothing so
[1:11:24] you know she was looking for the Messiah
[1:11:27] and when Jesus came and manifested the
[1:11:29] word because the word discerned the
[1:11:31] thoughts that was in the heart
[1:11:32] as Hebrews 4 says it will 4 12 that he
[1:11:35] would the word was a discerner of the
[1:11:37] thoughts of the heart and he came as the
[1:11:39] son of man the prophet what happened
[1:11:41] this priest with only intellectual
[1:11:43] learning said it's the devil
[1:11:46] because that's what his denomination
[1:11:49] called it
[1:11:50] what did it do he had no representation
[1:11:55] so it blacked him out
[1:11:58] you remember the message Wednesday
[1:12:00] every Sunday one about representation we
[1:12:03] were chosen in him
[1:12:06] he Representatives we were chosen to him
[1:12:09] he come here with us in him we didn't
[1:12:11] come here with him and us
[1:12:15] but this little woman had nothing to
[1:12:17] present
[1:12:17] she was so filled in dirties as could be
[1:12:20] but notice way down in her
[1:12:23] she's got representation
[1:12:28] and then she was looking for this to be
[1:12:30] made flesh and when he said go get your
[1:12:33] husband this ain't coming up what'd he
[1:12:35] say you said the truth cause you've had
[1:12:37] five or not yours others called him
[1:12:39] Bells above she called in the Messiah
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:46] I notice he came to be a redeemer is
[1:12:48] that right congregation said amen
[1:12:51] what were what does redeem mean bring
[1:12:54] back
[1:12:55] why didn't he get the priest
[1:12:59] he never was up there
[1:13:02] okay see he had no representation
[1:13:07] now what's he trying to explain
[1:13:09] representation
[1:13:13] when at the same time
[1:13:15] that he would write your name in the
[1:13:16] book
[1:13:18] would he not know to leave the others
[1:13:20] out of the book
[1:13:21] is that simple
[1:13:24] but would he not know them
[1:13:27] would he not know of them
[1:13:31] no no no it's just us
[1:13:35] we're the elect
[1:13:37] yes that's good
[1:13:41] that was the only thing I wanted to say
[1:13:42] to the brothers yesterday he was
[1:13:44] preaching only lack to be in one group
[1:13:46] and whosoever we'll be in another one I
[1:13:48] agree with you it was perfect brother
[1:13:49] Brown was a message that's perfect but I
[1:13:51] want to ask you one question
[1:13:53] why did Brother random say I'd rather
[1:13:55] say whosoever will than to say William
[1:13:58] Brown
[1:14:00] he said because there's a lot of William
[1:14:02] branhams
[1:14:03] but I can take that whosoever will as
[1:14:06] being me
[1:14:07] I'm not throwing off on a man's message
[1:14:09] he's done a wonderful job
[1:14:10] but he came to redeem
[1:14:13] but roll it on up and look
[1:14:16] bring those in the 141. now listen
[1:14:18] friend if you only think you got is just
[1:14:21] intellectual learning you get something
[1:14:23] different from that and you'll never be
[1:14:25] able to get it unless you got
[1:14:27] representation that's not why that's the
[1:14:30] reason I believe you come from the east
[1:14:32] and west north and south where living
[1:14:34] May manifest
[1:14:36] all right what did the little woman have
[1:14:38] go on to 17.
[1:14:41] excuse me
[1:14:43] yeah I guess it's 7 to 18 17.
[1:14:48] what does she have
[1:14:50] that's supposed to be paragraph 177
[1:14:54] and 179 okay roll it on up right down to
[1:14:57] the bottom save time we'll get through
[1:14:59] rain on that what does she have
[1:15:04] now if it hadn't been
[1:15:06] in dire to begin with
[1:15:09] if she hadn't had representation
[1:15:12] from predestination
[1:15:17] it never took hold
[1:15:22] so what is it what if
[1:15:25] predestination
[1:15:27] foreknowledge is first
[1:15:31] those who we foreknew he did
[1:15:32] predestinate so if you for knew the
[1:15:35] little woman would be looking for the
[1:15:36] Messiah
[1:15:39] when he foreknew the priest now watch
[1:15:41] the priest was looking from Messiah
[1:15:43] right
[1:15:44] come on
[1:15:47] that was their whole goal was looking
[1:15:49] for a messiah
[1:15:53] but when the discernment was used for
[1:15:55] the little woman
[1:15:59] she said
[1:16:00] you're the Messiah
[1:16:02] right
[1:16:05] the priests Belgium up you're the devil
[1:16:08] you're casting out Devils my Bell's
[1:16:10] above
[1:16:13] cut him off didn't it
[1:16:17] and we better be careful what we say
[1:16:21] about God's word
[1:16:25] you think I don't live in fear
[1:16:29] not fear of being lost
[1:16:32] if I die and go to hell I've been I'm
[1:16:34] happy
[1:16:36] I'm honest I'm happy because I've seen
[1:16:39] what the prophets desired to look into
[1:16:44] sing God's word unfold to speak of a
[1:16:48] bride
[1:16:48] and the truth of what you would be and
[1:16:51] how she would come into the world
[1:16:53] and what she would do
[1:16:56] reach seeds not out with a shelter or uh
[1:16:59] what is the other one masterpiece
[1:17:02] and find out how great brother random
[1:17:04] called us
[1:17:06] when he said Mary that was the carrier
[1:17:10] of the seed
[1:17:12] was not the seed
[1:17:14] go read it
[1:17:16] she was a carrier
[1:17:18] Jesus was deceived he said and that
[1:17:22] represents Pentecost
[1:17:26] not meaning there's anything wrong but
[1:17:29] they could only be carriers
[1:17:33] but he said this is the time for the
[1:17:36] seed
[1:17:38] the seed to be made alive the word to be
[1:17:41] made Alive In You and I
[1:17:45] coming from God's mind
[1:17:47] into reality
[1:17:50] I stated about the Rapture it's always
[1:17:53] been wonderful to me when I heard him
[1:17:54] when he first said it
[1:17:57] because I knew that the Bible and what
[1:17:58] it said was prophecies
[1:18:01] change the moment a twinkle of an eye
[1:18:03] center Etc was prophecies
[1:18:08] but around when he got in that message
[1:18:09] he said it has been spoken now let it
[1:18:14] come to pass
[1:18:16] he didn't add to the Bible
[1:18:18] he told us what it was saying he didn't
[1:18:22] add to the Bible when he said
[1:18:24] Abraham and Sarah was made Young
[1:18:28] which nobody knew that right
[1:18:33] he didn't add to the Bible
[1:18:34] he told us what the Bible was saying
[1:18:39] he said there's going to be a bride in
[1:18:40] the end time
[1:18:45] he said God's not complete without you
[1:18:51] he said the bride will be the fullness
[1:18:52] of the godhead bodily
[1:18:59] that's just making too much out of the
[1:19:01] Bride why
[1:19:03] he said it why can't I say it
[1:19:08] why can't we confess Who We Are
[1:19:11] stop being so negative about what we
[1:19:13] well or whatever you want
[1:19:16] if there's bride we'd be seeing a whole
[1:19:18] lot more
[1:19:20] we'd be seeing a whole lot more if you
[1:19:23] would get that out of your mind
[1:19:25] because that's the hindrance to keep it
[1:19:27] from coming to pies
[1:19:29] you could at least be as a prophet said
[1:19:31] if I can't produce it what'd he say
[1:19:35] come on what did the prophet says he
[1:19:38] said if I can't produce it he said don't
[1:19:40] let me stand in the way
[1:19:43] of somebody that can
[1:19:46] we come in here with our little petty
[1:19:48] feelings and ideas and
[1:19:50] our
[1:19:53] rear ends on our shoulder
[1:19:56] where you'll understand
[1:20:00] put them back where they're supposed to
[1:20:01] be and set out on them
[1:20:05] we don't think about what brought around
[1:20:07] anyone would say
[1:20:09] what if God had that person to say that
[1:20:11] to you to see what you do
[1:20:13] and then we when blood's gone don't
[1:20:16] don't bother love me
[1:20:24] I know
[1:20:27] and I'm hard and strong I know that
[1:20:33] and I know I pray
[1:20:36] we saw something yesterday and
[1:20:38] I was three o'clock this morning
[1:20:43] praying
[1:20:47] up at six
[1:20:50] praying for those two people
[1:20:54] that we saw the problem
[1:20:57] a 70 year old man and a 20 year old girl
[1:21:04] you think that don't hurt me
[1:21:07] if it had been here it would have been a
[1:21:09] different situation
[1:21:12] almost got up and took the brother out
[1:21:15] I knew if I did
[1:21:17] cause a mass confusion
[1:21:20] but you let him come here
[1:21:23] I'll take him out
[1:21:26] physically if I have to
[1:21:28] you'd be hateful enough to do that
[1:21:31] yeah
[1:21:33] because I'd be trying to save your
[1:21:35] little daughters
[1:21:36] any of you get upset at me
[1:21:40] you were to claw his eyes out
[1:21:47] but we're supposed to be loving brother
[1:21:50] Dale
[1:21:53] yeah and let garbage cans go on
[1:22:03] too late
[1:22:06] now is too late
[1:22:11] what are we gonna do
[1:22:14] what do you think about predestination
[1:22:16] you're open for questions and answer
[1:22:18] this afternoon comments I even write
[1:22:20] that down
[1:22:21] give your comments tell us what you
[1:22:24] believe
[1:22:25] but you know what most people ain't
[1:22:27] going to tell you what they believe
[1:22:34] I asked a person one time had been in
[1:22:36] the church for about three or four years
[1:22:37] I said what does your pastor preach on
[1:22:39] the show that ain't never heard him
[1:22:40] preach on it
[1:22:43] well
[1:22:45] you come here about three months you're
[1:22:47] going to hear it
[1:22:52] because I'm going to tell you what I
[1:22:53] believe in that way it won't be no bars
[1:22:57] at judgment
[1:23:00] it's all for my hands
[1:23:02] but I just don't like your attitude
[1:23:04] brother Dale
[1:23:06] have you prayed for my attitude as much
[1:23:08] as you ridicule my attitude
[1:23:11] Pride
[1:23:13] hey remember I gotta look over yours
[1:23:19] right
[1:23:21] come on
[1:23:23] now the pastor's the quote says he's
[1:23:26] supposed to do it all
[1:23:33] but there's one thing about it when we
[1:23:35] come to the Judgment Day then I don't
[1:23:36] have to back up
[1:23:38] brother Brown said if you make it soft
[1:23:39] they think you're trying to pull
[1:23:40] something over on them
[1:23:44] come on musician
[1:23:46] so I make it as tough as I can
[1:23:49] and tell you to pray for my attitude
[1:23:53] uh-huh
[1:23:56] I'll tell you one thing about it
[1:23:59] if you pray for my attitude God's going
[1:24:01] to show you
[1:24:02] that that man loves your soul
[1:24:09] and he wants us right
[1:24:11] we get over on the other side we ain't
[1:24:13] gonna be talking about
[1:24:16] well brother Dale you said I wouldn't
[1:24:18] ride
[1:24:21] you hurt my feelings
[1:24:26] so what
[1:24:31] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:24:33] will set you free but have I become your
[1:24:35] enemy as Paul said because I've told you
[1:24:38] the truth
[1:24:42] if I hadn't told you the truth
[1:24:44] your duty bound to come to me but no you
[1:24:46] go talk to everybody else
[1:24:51] you talk to everybody else
[1:24:54] that's Schism in the body you'll answer
[1:24:56] for that
[1:25:02] you'll answer for talking to other
[1:25:03] people instead of coming to me
[1:25:07] because you might find out I didn't say
[1:25:09] what you thought
[1:25:14] that's one of the tapes with her
[1:25:17] so that I can play the tape to see if
[1:25:20] that's what I said
[1:25:22] you know most preachers will not let you
[1:25:24] play have a tape right
[1:25:28] comes a change in too often
[1:25:31] right
