[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] good morning all right good
[0:05] morning all right good to have everybody
[0:07] here good to be back everything's in one
[0:11] place one
[0:13] Accord one mind one
[0:16] heart all right so let's get uh let's
[0:19] get finished with the second seal today
[0:21] I want to bring out
[0:23] something before we start the third seal
[0:30] when he had opened the second seal now
[0:32] we've been on the second seal for a
[0:33] while so this it's time to get off and
[0:34] go to the next I heard the second beast
[0:36] say come and see and there went out
[0:38] another horse that was Red Power was
[0:40] given un him that set on there to take
[0:42] peace from the earth and that they
[0:44] should kill one
[0:46] another with a what should kill one
[0:49] another and then what he given though
[0:51] what how do they kill each other though
[0:52] really great sword that's what really
[0:54] does the killing uh that they didn't
[0:56] kill each other just for killing each
[0:58] other I was thinking this
[1:02] morning every war has something to do
[1:05] with religion every conflict has
[1:07] something to do with religion and we're
[1:08] going to read that this afternoon
[1:09] because you know what we call Jesus the
[1:11] prince of peace right you know he said I
[1:14] didn't come to bring peace right right
[1:17] that's what he said he said I did not
[1:18] come to bring peace he said I come to
[1:20] make mother against father sister
[1:22] against
[1:23] brother what he said I'll read it it's
[1:25] in the Bible in he said he said in other
[1:28] words bring a variance between two well
[1:30] see he didn't come purposely to do that
[1:32] we know he was a prince of peace yes but
[1:34] when he come into this world he caused
[1:36] such a violent reaction from the other
[1:39] side till it has not stopped and it will
[1:43] not stop until we not even in the
[1:45] Millennium okay no no no remember still
[1:49] seventh day everything's got to go to
[1:50] that Eighth Day where everything is
[1:51] peace peace will not be on earth yes
[1:54] there will be a time of rejoicing a time
[1:55] of Jubilee during the Thousand Years of
[1:57] millennial Reign but there's still at
[1:59] the end of that time there is a conflict
[2:02] that's coming dog and Magog yes okay dog
[2:05] and Magog so you you still got battle
[2:08] right we won't have battles but maybe
[2:10] somebody else is going to have one
[2:11] because there's going to be Heathen
[2:12] raised up and there's going to be a lot
[2:13] of things going on in the Millennium
[2:15] that you
[2:16] can't attribute to the Future home so so
[2:18] when Jesus
[2:21] came now we know for sure this is
[2:24] natural killing for one but he was given
[2:28] him one man with one sword can't kill 68
[2:31] million people right yeah one man with
[2:34] one sword canot kill 68 million people
[2:38] but one man with a great word that's
[2:40] right could kill 68 million people all
[2:44] right so you see which is more powerful
[2:45] the sword of the word the word's more
[2:48] powerful because what comes from the
[2:49] word it's why we have all these
[2:51] divisions now we have you know syrians
[2:53] libyans we have all these different
[2:55] variants that are in the earth now and
[2:58] it's all because of religion that's
[3:00] right it really is basic bottom line
[3:02] it's all because of
[3:03] religion why do the Baptist not go to
[3:06] Methodist
[3:08] Church why the meth not go to Catholic I
[3:11] asked them at one time I said why don't
[3:12] y'all go to each other's church I said
[3:13] you believe same thing no we
[3:15] don't see so there's a variance there
[3:18] that even inside of religion there's a
[3:20] variance of you believe this and I
[3:22] believe this now let's come up to the
[3:24] message yeah right where that that man
[3:27] is riding not out there anymore he's
[3:29] riding here
[3:31] yeah here that there's now a Vance and
[3:35] there's been a great sword given and
[3:38] it's how this person handles that sword
[3:41] because if you take the right way of
[3:43] doing it like we're showing the right
[3:44] way of sanctification if you use that
[3:47] great sword then that great word then
[3:49] you what you're sanctifying a group of
[3:52] people cuz we're being washed Paul said
[3:54] by the word of the word so every time we
[3:56] come in that's why the sanctification
[3:59] does not end
[4:00] justification won't end until we take a
[4:02] body chain sanctification won't end
[4:04] until we take a body chain and the
[4:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost won't end till
[4:07] until we take a body change and you say
[4:09] well end see remember it's not end like
[4:12] end it'll become to its fullness okay
[4:16] cuz look when we get to Glory we won't
[4:17] need to be
[4:20] justified and if you'll believe
[4:23] it those who is Justified is already
[4:25] glorified and that's down here yes not
[4:28] up there that's down here that's how
[4:30] close these Riders when you look at
[4:32] these Riders you're not looking at at at
[4:35] far off and and what's coming and and
[4:38] you know um I'll be glad when we get to
[4:41] heaven okay what are you going to do
[4:43] when you get there if you don't know
[4:44] what it's like I mean how you know
[4:45] you're going to be there if you don't
[4:47] know you know you say you you take
[4:50] somebody that's never been out of their
[4:52] community and say Africa or somewhere
[4:54] and you take them to New York City well
[4:56] if you haven't explain New York City to
[4:58] them you going to say well this is New
[5:00] York City and they're going to go okay
[5:03] big
[5:04] buildings what what's the significance
[5:06] here right but if you give him a history
[5:08] book and let him read the history and
[5:10] let somebody teach him about where he's
[5:12] going then you'll do just like Rebecca
[5:16] alar described Isaac so well to when
[5:20] when when Rebecca comes into that town
[5:23] she doesn't look over to elar and say
[5:26] where is he right the Bible says she
[5:29] immediately Dismounts off of her camel
[5:31] and runs toward him she knows exactly
[5:34] elar has and that's what our elar to the
[5:36] day the Holy Ghost through brother
[5:38] brandom bringing a greater view of God
[5:42] than anybody's ever brought
[5:44] before and not that he's somewhere that
[5:46] we got to go out under and get that he's
[5:49] not thee he's here he's right here all
[5:51] right and how we going to know that
[5:53] we're going to know that by a great word
[5:54] or a great sword we must have a great
[5:56] word in the end time to take us not just
[6:01] to a Sanctified
[6:05] condition cuz if you everybody that was
[6:08] born again from from the day of
[6:10] Pentecost until right now had to go
[6:12] through a sanctifying condition you
[6:14] weren't born Sanctified right so
[6:17] everybody's went through a sanctifying
[6:19] condition but now no one has had a
[6:22] Sanctified
[6:24] body except Jesus Christ right the only
[6:28] the only one that has that's reached
[6:31] immortality and I got something else
[6:32] just a little few more keys on the
[6:34] dimensions the other night and on that
[6:37] so he's the only one that's reached
[6:40] immortality but he can come down through
[6:43] those dimensions and move anywhere he
[6:45] wants to MH that's why he came to John
[6:48] on patmas laid his hand on him and
[6:50] didn't have a problem laying his hand on
[6:52] a what we would say would be um the Apex
[6:56] of human flesh which is a body change
[6:58] that's the Apex of human flesh to the
[7:00] lowest form of human flesh which is our
[7:02] stinking body on in this Dimension that
[7:04] we're in now he didn't have a problem
[7:05] laying his hand on John and say fear not
[7:07] don't worry about it
[7:09] right and that's what he's doing now
[7:12] because remember if he's pleased to
[7:14] dwell in you then he's already in you
[7:16] that's right he's not coming from
[7:18] somewhere he's already in you so if he's
[7:21] already in you then he's doing the work
[7:22] we know that toward the outside and he's
[7:25] working through that filter of called of
[7:29] spirit because remember our body does
[7:32] nothing without what inside man tells it
[7:35] to do nothing it can't even move of its
[7:37] own
[7:39] self
[7:40] right and if you'll really sit down and
[7:43] think about death and you know with with
[7:45] Tommy Dy and and all looking at him
[7:48] laying there in the casket there was
[7:50] something that fired that man for 60
[7:52] something years and then all of a sudden
[7:53] that he the the firing mechanism left
[7:57] body's still there the Bible says we
[7:59] plant them in corruption cuz we have to
[8:01] put that corruption into the ground even
[8:04] Jesus's body was heading toward
[8:06] corruption it wasn't corrupt him but it
[8:08] was heading toward corruption cells were
[8:10] already beginning to break down um just
[8:14] like Lazarus hey Lazarus was in the Tomb
[8:16] 4 days and his nose he was sing and his
[8:18] nose fell in Jesus was you know really
[8:21] just two and a half but it was in three
[8:23] days Friday Saturday Sunday but it
[8:26] wasn't that whole day Sunday he was only
[8:27] really 24 to to something hour not even
[8:30] 36 hours in the grave so but it was
[8:33] heading toward corruption so everything
[8:35] that we plan in corruption Paul says
[8:38] that when we raise them we raise them in
[8:40] incorruption right so you got to plant
[8:42] them into the earth that is
[8:45] cursed but they don't stay there they're
[8:48] going to be raised in incorruption if
[8:50] you have the same spirit that raised up
[8:51] Jesus from the dead you'll get raised
[8:53] the same way he got raised right
[8:58] right not too farfetched is it really
[9:01] simple it really is it's really just
[9:03] real simple when you look at death and
[9:05] and and Resurrection but we like Daddy
[9:08] said we think it's some big atom bomb
[9:12] great when really it's not it's it's
[9:15] just I was thinking about that the other
[9:18] night we we look at these seals and and
[9:22] maybe you're doing the same thing you're
[9:23] looking for this you you sitting on the
[9:26] edge of your seat and I'm sure they were
[9:27] back then s waiting for something and
[9:30] something something to come out of this
[9:32] you know something I'm going to get
[9:33] that's going to just explode me into the
[9:37] uh you know up into past Pluto you know
[9:39] you understand what I'm saying and he
[9:41] said it wasn't even for you so really
[9:44] they didn't get any of this they sure
[9:47] they got Revelation the the onion peel
[9:49] they got part of the onion they got part
[9:52] Revelation but they didn't get the full
[9:54] revelation of what he was trying to get
[9:55] them to see but he said it's not for you
[9:58] so see you and I now must take this yes
[10:01] take it past Pluto over into eternity
[10:04] because this is the Eternal Word of God
[10:06] MH but that that eternity's come here
[10:09] and now it's trying to get us there and
[10:12] when I say there I don't mean a place
[10:13] there I mean there in the word right a
[10:16] place in the word right let's not ever
[10:18] look for a place to go right it's it's
[10:21] it's in the word it's in the word of God
[10:23] the word of God's where the place to go
[10:25] all right that's the place to meet
[10:26] that's the place to Fellowship that's
[10:28] the place we going to be when we leave
[10:30] out of here we're going to be in the
[10:32] word yes all right and brother R said I
[10:34] read it like last Sunday or Sunday
[10:36] before that it's in the word all the way
[10:38] to get a body change you got to be in
[10:39] the word all the way all right not just
[10:42] a piece here and the piece here some
[10:44] things we you know think we get by with
[10:46] because if it's in the word it's Eternal
[10:50] there's no way to change it
[10:52] okay and that's a strange thing we're
[10:54] going to look at today because we're
[10:55] going to this afternoon we're going to
[10:57] look and see that the son of man
[10:59] the word made flesh mhm seemed to be you
[11:02] hear me now seemed to be that he broke
[11:04] the rules a lot of times okay seem to be
[11:07] I said but what he was doing was trying
[11:09] to reveal to him to get him off the
[11:12] letter and put him in flashh and put him
[11:15] standing there in front of them cuz they
[11:17] called him all kind of names and he
[11:18] called himself a wine bber and a glutton
[11:23] so he must have not fasted a lot cuz he
[11:25] said why the Pharisees said why don't
[11:26] y'all
[11:27] fast so you you see what I'm saying that
[11:30] he lived so close a human life though
[11:33] till they thought he was a devil they
[11:34] thought he just was anointed by
[11:37] something right is that too far off from
[11:39] what the people in the message believe
[11:40] that he was
[11:42] anointed then he became God on the River
[11:45] Jordan but he was anointed and you know
[11:47] hey come on if he was almighty God in
[11:50] human flesh the fullness of the godhead
[11:52] B then you know we need to just go find
[11:54] a good bar and right get
[11:57] drunk step out in front of a truck or
[12:00] something I mean really so I mean what's
[12:02] life for what are we what are we basing
[12:04] everything
[12:05] on WE base it on the word of God run it
[12:08] through our filter take what the prophet
[12:10] said which Jesus told them people he
[12:13] said he said these prophets wanted to
[12:15] see this day and said you've seen it in
[12:18] other words and turned me down so I say
[12:21] today the same thing the prophet walked
[12:24] in this land it's good that the prophet
[12:26] walked in the land but who was he
[12:28] pointing us to not him he was pointing
[12:29] us to Christ so that's who we were who
[12:32] we were supposed to see in the first
[12:33] place and everybody put you know instead
[12:37] of Jesus inter interceding and they put
[12:39] brother brandom doing the interceding
[12:41] which that's not true um but how close
[12:45] is it though when a man can
[12:48] say go as you are and don't do it
[12:51] anymore right you've been forgiven in
[12:53] other words you know you
[12:57] yes it was he was there he was there the
[13:01] the big age not the he brother brand the
[13:04] big age the big the Holy Ghost was there
[13:06] to do that because you and I even
[13:07] brother R and his Humanity Humanity
[13:09] couldn't do that God had to say hear ye
[13:12] him God had to be there doing the
[13:14] speaking because we'll read it this
[13:16] afternoon the son of man has has power
[13:18] to forgive sins on Earth amen okay so if
[13:21] the son of man Ministry was there in a
[13:23] prophet then he could do that that's the
[13:25] reason he had to wait all that length of
[13:27] time to go up to the mount Mountain to
[13:29] get that what to get that
[13:32] word to say go on as you are because I
[13:35] mean find out in the
[13:38] Bible Moses give him a writing of
[13:40] divorcement he gave him a
[13:42] paper brother didn't give you a paper
[13:45] that hey don't go s no more no he gave
[13:48] him a word he brought the son of man
[13:51] just like the son of man was standing on
[13:53] the earth doing things that he was
[13:55] supposed to do just like the word said
[13:58] and the outside world was like who you
[14:00] think you are okay so we'll see that
[14:02] maybe but same thing with these seals we
[14:05] we we sometimes we think we're all
[14:06] sitting on our edge of our seat wanting
[14:08] to wanting that little key
[14:12] word you going to have to find it for
[14:14] yourself amen
[14:16] yes I can just you know maybe bring an
[14:20] angle that you haven't seen that's true
[14:22] that's what a preacher usually does
[14:23] he'll bring an angle that you've never
[14:25] seen
[14:26] before and and if and if it matches the
[14:29] word then you can put it both together
[14:31] that's right and it'll come up a
[14:34] wonderful Revelation
[14:36] right cuz sometimes we do get mule
[14:38] blinders we'll get the SS we'll get now
[14:40] them seals has got to mean this
[14:43] well we know one thing for sure the
[14:45] letter of the seals that was preached in
[14:47] 1963 has done us no
[14:50] good the letter you hear what I said the
[14:52] letter yes and I say that and I say that
[14:56] because I go back you say Well it we
[14:59] don't need to read it see there you go
[15:00] off on the other end no you got to read
[15:03] it to get Revelation you got to read it
[15:06] but you're not understanding it right in
[15:08] the way God wants you to understand
[15:10] that's same way with Jesus Jesus is
[15:11] saying look they said hey we got in
[15:13] other words we got Moses's
[15:15] quotebook we have Moses we have Abraham
[15:18] see they're going back to the prophets
[15:20] well people say well we have brother R
[15:21] he preached the seal so they must be
[15:23] open yeah to one
[15:25] man so that he can give them to us amen
[15:29] right but we the ones that's got to get
[15:30] the
[15:31] revelation of this so don't think that
[15:34] that I'm going to come here and stand
[15:35] here one Sunday and you're going to
[15:37] go red horse rider and just D It's just
[15:40] something nobody's ever thought of no
[15:42] you got to get it for yourself
[15:44] amen but remember what brother R said he
[15:46] said it's got to compare with every
[15:48] scripture in the Bible right Genesis to
[15:50] Revelation it's got to compare with
[15:51] every scripture in the Bible it cannot
[15:53] be
[15:54] something far off that's right okay it's
[15:58] got to be right in the word of
[16:01] God but the horses read take peace from
[16:04] the earth they should kill one another
[16:06] and they was giving him a great sword
[16:08] now what is the word of God doing the
[16:09] sword is always the word so what is it
[16:11] doing it's killing it's killing what
[16:13] it's killing the old
[16:15] you killing the old part of you that
[16:19] still we haven't killed it yet we've
[16:22] divorced it right like brother BR said
[16:25] open the closet and stuck it well I
[16:27] don't no it's got to be dead
[16:29] for you to be married to Christ your old
[16:31] husband has to be dead for you to be
[16:33] married to somebody else your old
[16:34] husband got to be dead Okay so that's
[16:36] just pretty plain
[16:39] right when you see the ox age was this
[16:42] age right
[16:44] here the fourth age which this is where
[16:47] 68 million people were killed because of
[16:49] what religion because of a word that
[16:53] went
[16:54] out a word sword a word went out from
[16:58] the Pope from Rome or from the Roman
[17:01] Catholic church and says anybody that
[17:03] doesn't say the thing we say do the
[17:06] thing we do kill them right MH so
[17:11] there's your religious
[17:12] War okay religious War killed have you
[17:15] read how the hund how the um 12 apostles
[17:18] were
[17:19] killed have you ever read it before
[17:21] there's a little thing somewhere around
[17:22] here in church it's got all 12 some of
[17:24] them went in different places I think
[17:26] Matthew or somebody went to India and
[17:27] this one went to different places but
[17:29] they were pulled apart they were buried
[17:31] hung upside down Peter was hung upside
[17:33] down one of them James got his head cut
[17:35] off neither one you see how they got
[17:37] killed why because of because people
[17:38] didn't like them no no because of that
[17:42] sword that
[17:44] word so Satan's got a sword God's got a
[17:47] sword that's right Satan has a word but
[17:50] you know what it
[17:51] is the Bible one word off
[17:55] that's Satan sword is the Bible one word
[17:59] off the whole Bible don't you think he
[18:02] was sitting right there when all this
[18:03] was going on Amen sure he was so the
[18:06] great sord is the is the pure word but
[18:08] it was what they did with that pure word
[18:10] that's correct okay cuz like brother R
[18:13] said the pure pure unadulterated word
[18:14] has struck the ground struck the Earth
[18:18] right that should have meant we took a
[18:20] body change right then if the pure and
[18:23] adulterated word had struck the Earth
[18:24] back in ' 63 when he was preaching the
[18:26] seal right we should took a body chain
[18:30] it struck the
[18:31] Earth but it didn't strike it in the
[18:34] fullness your word yes sir
[18:38] right and to some it became a word not
[18:42] the word right cuz like the people in
[18:44] the Bible says well some part of it is
[18:46] the word of God some part of it's not
[18:49] well then who knows which is and which
[18:51] isn't I guess you have to ask them cuz
[18:53] they're the ones that decided
[18:55] that right if they decided that that
[18:57] part of it isn't part was not then I
[18:59] guess you got to go back and ask them
[19:00] people well which part is and which part
[19:02] not it's got to be the full word of God
[19:05] Satan has just took it and twisted at
[19:07] one word so this great sword that Satan
[19:10] has is not
[19:12] some
[19:15] um black horrible thing but it's the
[19:18] most horrible thing in the world to be
[19:20] one word off look what happened to Eve
[19:22] being one word off right billions
[19:26] billions of people on the Earth and and
[19:28] then there's that many more billions
[19:30] that's already died just because what
[19:31] she did right
[19:34] right we going to get into that too
[19:36] because there was something opened up
[19:38] there remember cancer and and demons
[19:41] travel in what dimension fourth
[19:44] dimension
[19:46] death and life travels in the fourth
[19:48] dimension you say oh how does that well
[19:50] how does God come down and talk to you
[19:53] you listen to messages don't you God
[19:56] speaks to
[19:57] you fourth dimension is radio waves TV
[20:01] and demons so demons travel in fourth
[20:04] dimension there was no there was no time
[20:07] that there was a cancer until Eve did
[20:10] what she did there was no time there was
[20:12] death until she did what she did there
[20:13] was no sorrow until she did what she did
[20:16] so something transpired when God said I
[20:18] will put enmity or division between God
[20:21] and man but I'm the one that's going to
[20:23] bring it back together and he's bringing
[20:25] it back together what through these
[20:27] Seven Seals is where he brought truly
[20:30] brought man because these seals are the
[20:32] entire Bible made manifest okay and
[20:35] that's how God brought it back he's
[20:36] bringing it back through the word of God
[20:38] not some separate
[20:42] word so you see how close it is yes and
[20:46] look brother brandom um tells us he
[20:49] talks about uh uh brotherly
[20:52] kindness he talks about
[20:56] uh somebody talks about brotherly
[20:58] brother Brown said now now if you you
[21:01] don't have to physically kill somebody
[21:04] anymore you kill their influence you've
[21:07] killed that person right just as much if
[21:10] you'd have killed him with a gun you
[21:12] have killed his influence you have
[21:14] killed that person why because nobody's
[21:16] going to listen to him if they start
[21:17] telling you uh brother Dale's wrong here
[21:19] brother Wade's wrong here we see that
[21:21] they kill your influence and then the
[21:23] people or whoever's true I just say us
[21:26] because we're here right right any y'all
[21:28] any of y'all go preach the word of God
[21:30] and they say hey don't listen to that
[21:31] because it's not true that's not the
[21:33] doctrine I
[21:34] preach then they've killed your
[21:36] influence they just might as well kill
[21:38] you m
[21:41] right but there was given unto him a
[21:43] great sword so the sword he was given
[21:46] see look watch you see oh he was given a
[21:49] false word God can't give a false word
[21:53] that's right God has to give the
[21:55] revealed word amen and then Satan Ted
[21:59] just by one word right so he was given a
[22:01] great that's why it says a great
[22:02] sword he was given a great sword because
[22:05] he was given a sword so
[22:08] close because we're truly supposed to
[22:10] take the word and kill people with it
[22:14] yes brother D kills us I hope he does
[22:17] that's our problem he don't kill us
[22:18] every Sunday we just we just push him
[22:21] over in the closet and then when he gets
[22:22] done we bring him back
[22:24] out right but if you kill that thing
[22:28] it's dead it ain't going to you don't
[22:30] want to revive something that's that
[22:32] dead that's right you don't want to
[22:34] revive but see you got but a Sanctified
[22:36] body then the Sanctified body is the
[22:40] body of Christ there was sanctification
[22:42] going through every Church
[22:45] age every Church age there was a
[22:48] Sanctified group of people yes but they
[22:51] couldn't come all the way out because of
[22:54] the word they had they could what I mean
[22:56] what I mean by you got to listen to what
[22:57] brother was talking on that 49 and
[23:00] 50 the 49 is your church ages 77
[23:05] right if you the reason let me tell you
[23:08] something the reason you got a 49 so 7 *
[23:13] 7 all right that's 49 that's seven type
[23:16] of seven Church ages all right everybody
[23:19] got that but now what is
[23:22] that it's
[23:23] time okay right now when the Jews when
[23:27] they were supp to celebrate that Jubilee
[23:32] year in this year that's why I preacher
[23:35] argu with Daddy and I wish I'd have been
[23:37] there cuz I i' helped him a little
[23:39] bit he said oh no they celebrated the
[23:42] Jubilee they celebrated jubile every
[23:45] seven
[23:46] years they've never stopped doing that I
[23:48] think modern times they don't do it
[23:50] anymore but every seven
[23:52] years look R
[23:55] Rachel um who was it worked for Rachel
[23:58] and Li
[24:00] Jacob Jacob worked seven
[24:05] years he wasn't a slave he was working
[24:08] toward something so he could get a wife
[24:11] and then poor old laan well not poor old
[24:13] Laban poor old Jacob Laban um hued him
[24:16] and got him to work seven more
[24:18] years bless his heart hey he worked
[24:21] seven years to get a wife we can't stand
[24:24] a year be dating a girl for a year some
[24:26] of y'all Rachel said J couldn't last a
[24:29] minute if she
[24:33] ever you know what Joseph said Joseph
[24:35] said there's a time of
[24:38] grieving Rachel held up one
[24:41] minute one
[24:44] minute the question was is if your
[24:47] spouse passed or your wife passed
[24:50] away how long would it take for you to
[24:52] get over it and and go on and get
[24:54] married either one year one uh one day
[24:56] one year well one day one month one year
[24:58] or I've got the T-shirt I don't want
[25:00] another one most people said I got the
[25:02] T-shirt I don't want another one but
[25:05] Rachel but Joe under one minute so he's
[25:08] under stress if anything ever happens
[25:11] so I'm not going anywhere with that a 10
[25:16] no more anyway so he worked seven years
[25:19] to get her then he worked seven more all
[25:22] right but that's still type of the
[25:23] church agent but what he done though he
[25:26] was working off a debt
[25:29] right I think we still get in our mind
[25:31] that that it's slavery like the old
[25:33] South and no that's not
[25:35] it Jacob comes up to laan and says I
[25:39] want Rachel right he said if you'll work
[25:41] for me labor for me seven years you can
[25:45] have her all right normally if laan
[25:47] hadn't been a
[25:49] um Shyer himself you
[25:52] know he would have worked seven years
[25:55] that seventh year he would have got
[25:57] Rachel and they would have went off cuz
[26:00] he had paid his debt that's right okay
[26:02] same way with here you have paid your
[26:05] debt but you still got something here
[26:07] that there's not a debt paid yet it sure
[26:10] it is in Calvary we know that but your
[26:13] body stays here right right nobody's
[26:17] took a Rapture in seven Church ages
[26:19] everybody's body is in the ground right
[26:22] now that's right Christian born again
[26:26] True Believers even even all these
[26:29] Church a Messengers are laying in the
[26:33] dirt right that's why the word had to be
[26:36] made dust where it had to be made dirt
[26:38] to take away the sin right but they're
[26:41] laying in the ground so their soul came
[26:46] out the seven they got they got a
[26:48] seven-year release they got a release
[26:51] their soul went out went to what sixth
[26:53] Dimension yeah the body stayed in the
[26:55] ground that's why Leviticus 25 58 said
[26:58] if you go in and you get a if he gives
[27:01] you a wife then you go out but the wife
[27:05] stays or in other words in other words
[27:10] if you
[27:11] acrew
[27:14] debt then part of that debt goes out but
[27:18] there's still something that stays in
[27:20] like the wife or even the
[27:23] children what why they didn't celebrate
[27:25] a
[27:26] 50 because if you if you you're a
[27:31] Headmaster and I owed you
[27:35] $500 this one owed you $500 and this one
[27:38] owed you $500 that made him have
[27:42] $1,500 and you had and you had 00 0
[27:45] 0 the golden jubilee that they were
[27:48] supposed to have
[27:50] celebrated was that this right
[27:54] here he had to give
[27:59] that one back 500 that one back 500 that
[28:02] one back 500 and he was at
[28:06] zero or everybody was
[28:10] equal during that seven years if you if
[28:13] somebody said okay I'll work a few years
[28:15] and give you 20
[28:17] acres well that don't happen on seven
[28:20] but that golden jubilee he had to give
[28:22] you that land back cuz you had worked
[28:24] the time you had worked that you had
[28:25] made it to that 50th Jubilee you had
[28:27] worked all that that time he had to give
[28:29] you that land back he had to give you
[28:31] that money back he had to give you that
[28:32] house back that's why the Jews never
[28:35] celebrated a 50 you a Jew ain't going to
[28:38] give it back that's right and God knew
[28:41] that remember I went through that on a u
[28:43] yes in a sermon about uh where God made
[28:46] the land
[28:47] rest he made that land rest why cuz he
[28:50] knew man wouldn't do
[28:52] it so what's a land the top
[28:56] of our bodies he made at rest so what
[28:59] when we put Duty in the ground Tommy I
[29:02] got when he put him in the ground what
[29:04] he's at
[29:06] rest he's at rest I'm going to tell you
[29:09] something about this I was telling
[29:11] Donnie the other day and me and Terence
[29:14] and Lisa was talking about it not too
[29:15] long ago we've had a lot of people in
[29:18] our life teren people and I'm sure you
[29:21] have why does somebody just suddenly
[29:25] die this been close to you helped you do
[29:28] things and then all of a sudden we had a
[29:31] friend of ours Dane Brown good guy real
[29:33] good friend of ours would do anything in
[29:35] the world for us help me in the
[29:36] beekeeping world he died of cancer L
[29:39] that just had it done finished no this
[29:43] one over here I get rich had it done
[29:45] finished G right okay everybody got
[29:50] that
[29:53] Tommy we know one thing's for sure that
[29:56] he had the mind of a 12-y old year old
[29:59] so the Bible says much is given much is
[30:01] required there wasn't much given so
[30:04] there's not much
[30:05] required right we know that there's a
[30:08] place for that person in heaven because
[30:10] he never reached the age of
[30:12] accountability god listen to me God and
[30:14] to be so gracious to allow that to
[30:16] happen but you're going to watch the
[30:17] next couple of years you're going to see
[30:18] people strangely pass
[30:20] away mark my word so but you say well
[30:24] what are you trying to get to this dust
[30:26] part why would he let somebody that he's
[30:29] going to give eternal life to say Dean
[30:32] brown or Lisa's grandma or somebody that
[30:34] was good to us that didn't care nothing
[30:36] I didn't don't say don't care nothing
[30:37] about God but just was not a
[30:39] Christian but but the Lord said a cup of
[30:42] water in my name will not be forgotten
[30:43] here or there that's right and then all
[30:45] of a sudden you see them pass away and
[30:47] you grieve why
[30:49] grieve they ain't got to go through any
[30:52] tribulation period they don't have to be
[30:55] persecuted God's going to hide them and
[30:57] let let them rest until way over there
[31:00] at the white throne and he's going to
[31:02] raise them up give them eternal life you
[31:05] just watch people's been good to you
[31:06] I've always wondered we were talking
[31:08] about that the other day wondering about
[31:09] people that was being real good to you
[31:10] and all of a sudden they
[31:12] die you say well that's horrible is it I
[31:17] don't think it's so horrible that God
[31:18] goes ahead and let some rest puts some
[31:20] over in the dimension where they just
[31:21] kind of hold them right there until
[31:23] everything's finished and he brings them
[31:24] out and says okay you get eternal life
[31:26] why s through the tribulation
[31:28] so you're going to see that happen and
[31:30] what a great Mighty God that we can see
[31:31] that that we had a prophet that told us
[31:34] that that somebody in that condition
[31:36] brother Brown said even somebody you
[31:38] know kid that was had an had a
[31:40] special Angel he had an extra angel or a
[31:43] special angel that watchs him through
[31:44] life D he definitely did wonderful did
[31:47] what I said Dy definitely sure he did
[31:49] sure we see we look back now we go man
[31:52] it had to be the angel of God helping
[31:54] him all through all through the way same
[31:56] with same with the people that's been
[31:58] good to us I just think that that's the
[32:01] closer we get to the end the more people
[32:04] are going to pass away cuz number one
[32:06] they can't come to a a word a the great
[32:09] word that we're supposed to come to and
[32:11] maybe you know even us me whoever but
[32:15] why a mighty God to let that happen and
[32:18] not carry this thing on out let anybody
[32:21] suffer and not let especially people
[32:22] that are uh maybe family members they're
[32:26] not going to go to heaven because they
[32:27] family members but you know you've seen
[32:28] some that's been real good to you and
[32:29] some that's not that's right that's why
[32:32] the ones you know what you always the
[32:33] old statement says the two mean to
[32:37] die that may have something to do with
[32:39] that if they real mean to you God may
[32:42] let them go through that tribulation
[32:44] period just to prove to him that you he
[32:46] was persecuting or she was persecuting a
[32:49] saint of God maybe you never thought
[32:51] about that but as these Dimensions open
[32:53] up that I'm studying on I can see a lot
[32:55] of things how God's moving and he got
[32:58] quit moving he's just he's moving all
[32:59] the time he's putting place his people
[33:02] here he's placing these here he's moving
[33:04] this one he's hiding
[33:06] people hide me in thy Pavilion Psalm
[33:09] says hide me you know so that's what
[33:12] these seals are doing to me to me though
[33:14] what the seals are doing the seals are
[33:16] absolutely what the prophet of God said
[33:18] we got to see the white horse rider Le
[33:20] leaving we got to see the red horse
[33:22] rider rider leaving we got to see the
[33:25] black horse rider leaving that's death
[33:28] amen then we got to see that Pale Horse
[33:30] we got to see all that separation and
[33:32] once we do see the separation you can
[33:35] look at the word that was truly given to
[33:37] us through the filter of the Holy Ghost
[33:40] and that's why we should be
[33:43] progressing in the word amen progressing
[33:47] in the word not not that not that I you
[33:52] know let me let me give you something
[33:53] that's going to shock the shock the fool
[33:56] out of you yes as I progress up the
[33:58] statue of perfect man I'm not going to
[33:59] get
[34:03] quieter
[34:06] right I'm not that's just not
[34:09] me Jesus the Bible said grew in Grace
[34:12] and knowledge and they called him a
[34:13] devil right right right that's right
[34:17] Jesus grew in Grace and knowledge and
[34:18] they called him they said I'm going to
[34:20] read it
[34:21] today even his sisters do you know he
[34:23] had sisters yes the Bible says his
[34:26] sisters be raided him over something he
[34:29] was
[34:33] doing oh but that was Jesus the perfect
[34:35] Son of God yeah he was so perfect till
[34:37] he was human right Renegade he acted so
[34:40] he wasn't Renegade he acted so human
[34:41] till his sisters
[34:43] like what's he doing that foolish stuff
[34:46] for cuz remember he tried to do some
[34:49] mighty Works in his hometown and he
[34:51] couldn't because what he was so common
[34:53] oh that's Joseph and Mary's boy and his
[34:56] sisters are here in other words ber
[34:58] raing him for what he's doing so don't
[35:01] think once you go up the statue perfect
[35:02] man that God's going to change your
[35:04] whole character he likes your character
[35:06] just the way it is I'm not going to get
[35:09] quieter so ior read for some of y'all
[35:12] I'm not going to get
[35:18] quieter kind of bad when a man stands up
[35:20] one day and and uh we go well now we
[35:23] need to go bury duty duty die we need to
[35:25] go bury Duty and the Very king of
[35:28] of of Life says Let the dead bury the
[35:31] dead right you know what he was saying
[35:35] why waste your time the words here you
[35:37] need to follow me amen now boy that hurt
[35:41] that hurt if brother Dale stood up and
[35:43] said now look we're not going to do this
[35:44] funeral cuz we're having church on
[35:45] Sunday if the funeral would have been
[35:47] Sunday you you understand what I mean I
[35:49] mean come on we got to get down to
[35:50] that's why I'm telling you when you get
[35:52] down to where that son of man Ministry
[35:54] is it's not some it's like I said we say
[35:56] he's the king of peace he is the king of
[35:58] Peace yes he's the king of righteousness
[36:00] but he said in his own word he said I
[36:02] didn't come to bring peace
[36:04] right he said the word of God since John
[36:07] has been fought with vengeance yes he
[36:10] said the Kingdom of Heaven is having to
[36:12] be taken by
[36:14] force and you going to fight your way
[36:16] look at all this look at all this
[36:17] fighting going on in these in these
[36:20] scriptures in these seals look at the
[36:21] fighting going on even the fifth seal
[36:24] you don't see fighting but you see the
[36:26] cause of the fight the fifth seal Jew
[36:29] were killed because of what their
[36:32] religion who they were that's right so
[36:35] the fifth seal is a
[36:36] variance The Sixth Seal by Heaven you
[36:39] know what that's going to be that's
[36:40] going to be the Earth right that Sixth
[36:43] Seal is is a total disruption of this
[36:45] Earth the nature they call what they
[36:46] want to do what about a what about two
[36:48] men standing on Earth and
[36:50] saying tornado or or
[36:53] somebody's it's not funny but really if
[36:56] you look at it and you start looking and
[36:58] you see this big army coming after two
[37:00] men Moses and Elijah you see these Army
[37:02] coming and you and they just go they
[37:05] just draw a line in the sand and walk
[37:08] back about 200 ft and then say open and
[37:10] that thing goes and that whole army goes
[37:13] right down in that thing and then shuts
[37:14] it right back up you say that's that's
[37:16] too farfetched it's already happened
[37:21] once theyan and car that's right mm
[37:24] Moses said if you're for me you better
[37:26] get up here on this High Ground where
[37:27] I'm at yes you better get right up here
[37:30] on The High Ground because something
[37:31] fixing happened down there and there was
[37:33] thousands of people that were buried in
[37:35] the thing just shut right back up so
[37:37] that's what they're going that's why
[37:38] Moses and Elijah's going to know what to
[37:39] do when they get here they've already
[37:41] done some of these things okay it's not
[37:43] going to be foreign to that Spirit of
[37:45] Moses and Elijah when they step on the
[37:46] earth and here this Army comes after
[37:48] them and they just
[37:50] go right ground
[37:53] open tornado take these people out you
[37:56] know tornado Hur can take all these
[37:58] airplanes that's fixing to come you
[37:59] don't thinking people going to try to
[38:00] bomb them listen if we can put a if we
[38:04] can put a bomb in a toilet in
[38:07] Iraq from the air that's right don't you
[38:10] think they going to be shooting for them
[38:12] and that was 20 something years ago you
