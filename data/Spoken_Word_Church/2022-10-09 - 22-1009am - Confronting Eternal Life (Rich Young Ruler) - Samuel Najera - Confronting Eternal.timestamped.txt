[21:24] can help us
[21:26] foreign
[21:32] I want to express this morning what God
[21:34] has given us this morning
[21:37] and so those who have who take notes
[21:42] this morning we want to talk about
[21:45] confrontando La Vida Eterna confronting
[21:48] eternal life
[21:53] and I believe that each and every one of
[21:55] us were confronting a day or facing a
[21:57] day
[21:59] because we don't know what's going to
[22:01] happen tomorrow
[22:03] but this morning
[22:07] we are face to face with eternal life
[22:10] foreign
[22:35] loving Heavenly Father we thank you this
[22:38] morning
[22:42] We Believe Lord that you're the only one
[22:45] that can help us
[22:48] or I have nothing Within Myself to give
[22:51] to my brethren but you do Lord
[22:57] and this morning we believe that you're
[23:00] here
[23:03] because you were the first one invited
[23:06] the first honored guest
[23:08] Lord help us this morning
[23:12] we commit ourselves into your holy hands
[23:16] they ask it in the name of the Lord
[23:18] Jesus Christ amen amen escritura
[23:28] we're gonna take this scripture
[23:31] Marcos capitulo dies
[23:34] Mark chapter 10 verse 17.
[23:43] read in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:45] Christ
[24:01] and when he was gone forth into the way
[24:04] there came one running and kneeled to
[24:06] him and asked him good Master what shall
[24:09] I do that I may inherit eternal life
[24:12] Jesus
[24:19] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[24:22] me good there is none good but one that
[24:25] is God
[24:28] Terrace
[24:37] the con the Commandments do not commit
[24:40] adultery do not kill do not steal do not
[24:43] bear false witness the frod not honor
[24:46] thy father and mother
[24:47] maestro
[24:51] is
[24:54] and he answered and said unto him master
[24:57] all these have I observed from my youth
[25:00] and ton says Jesus
[25:15] then Jesus beholden him loved him and
[25:18] said unto him one thing thou lack us go
[25:20] that way so whatsoever thou Hast and
[25:23] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[25:25] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[25:28] cross and follow me palabra
[25:38] mucho muchas posaciones and he was sad
[25:41] at that saying and went away grieved for
[25:43] he had great possessions
[25:55] and Jesus looked around about and says
[25:58] unto his disciples how hardly shall they
[26:01] have riches enter into the kingdom of
[26:03] God
[26:05] Lord Jesus Christ bless his word
[26:13] it's good to listen to this scripture
[26:17] and read the scripture
[26:22] but believe in that each day that goes
[26:25] by we're hopefully we're scaling up
[26:28] that we're growing in
[26:31] our walk with God
[26:36] and that's the reason why we come to
[26:38] church
[26:41] because we believe because we want to
[26:44] walk with God Amen
[26:49] and so this morning we're facing
[26:53] eternal life
[26:55] now when we're here at church
[26:59] we should lay us out all the problems
[27:03] all the weights and the sins that easily
[27:06] be said
[27:08] because we can be here seated at church
[27:13] let our mind be somewhere else
[27:17] thoughts could be somewhere else
[27:21] now you see the scripture that we were
[27:23] reading this young man
[27:53] how many of us know if we have eternal
[27:56] life
[27:58] have we really met the Lord face to face
[28:03] that's a good question
[28:06] because this the question that this
[28:08] young man has
[28:11] what can I do to inherit eternal life
[28:15] and so Jesus told him do you know the
[28:18] Commandments see yes
[28:22] so it's given to us there's been a
[28:25] homework that has been
[28:31] do the things that we need to do as a
[28:33] Christian
[28:36] fulfill the Commandments
[28:41] maybe we could say yes
[28:44] and so are we following the Lord
[28:50] the life that we live is what shows
[28:54] that we are following the Lord or trying
[28:56] to say
[28:58] now the Lord knows our hearts
[29:03] and there's there is something that I
[29:06] really like
[29:09] of an older person
[29:13] he asked he has the young man
[29:17] he said grandfather
[29:19] Iglesia he said why do why do you go to
[29:22] church
[29:23] was
[29:27] because I like it it's my duty to go to
[29:30] church
[29:32] what did you learn today
[29:36] well I don't know but maybe I didn't
[29:39] learn anything
[29:41] that's how we are sometimes
[29:46] why did we not learn something
[29:50] like because really we weren't in that
[29:53] church
[29:59] elsewhere
[30:02] maybe the the the ranchers the people
[30:05] out in the country
[30:08] maybe they were thinking there was a
[30:11] tree that was going to fall on their
[30:12] little house
[30:15] or that their cows were gonna go away
[30:18] and that's why they couldn't learn
[30:21] something at church that day
[30:24] now he's going to church every single
[30:27] time and what did you learn
[30:31] I don't know if I did learn something
[30:34] so why do you go to church
[30:43] we we call old
[30:48] we call them older because the older
[30:50] ones know
[30:53] because the life that they have lived
[30:57] the experience that they have had
[31:02] that's what made them to know what they
[31:04] know
[31:06] now watch this
[31:08] El Senor the Lord
[31:12] oh the the the the the the the man in
[31:15] this illustration the the older man
[31:19] cuatro canastas he had he had four
[31:22] baskets
[31:24] and in those four baskets
[31:27] there was carbon in those in those
[31:30] baskets
[31:33] do you know how carbon looks like
[31:36] how does carbon look like
[31:39] it has little little bitty pieces in it
[31:43] within it I guess
[31:47] and that place where you put those
[31:50] things in
[31:51] negro it looks dark it looks like so
[31:56] now notice
[31:59] the older man
[32:01] he told the young man
[32:04] go bring me water
[32:07] AWA go bring water okay okay
[32:13] but how am I gonna bring water in that
[32:15] basket
[32:17] go away go
[32:20] okay all right
[32:23] takes the basket
[32:26] and he fills it with water and he pulls
[32:29] it out
[32:30] and he takes it
[32:32] and he asks him where is the water the
[32:36] water fell out okay all right go get
[32:40] more water
[32:43] but the water keeps falling out of the
[32:45] basket no go go get more water
[32:50] okay all right
[32:52] he takes the basket he fills it with
[32:55] water and he tries to bring it to him
[32:59] where is the water
[33:01] where if it all fell out
[33:07] now compare these baskets with the one
[33:10] that you use to take out the water
[33:14] water is what cleanses right
[33:20] and water is the is compared to the word
[33:23] [Music]
[33:24] and
[33:26] so he told them he said look
[33:28] I go to church
[33:32] because I want to be clean I want to be
[33:35] washed
[33:37] [Applause]
[33:41] he said maybe yesterday I didn't learn
[33:44] but I went to church
[33:56] what keeps us clean brothers and sisters
[34:38] and if you reject the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:40] today
[34:43] you are facing eternal life
[34:45] and if you reject
[34:50] you have denied the Lord Jesus
[34:54] because as you reject is
[34:57] denying amen amen
[35:01] and so believing
[35:04] that what God has given us
[35:07] so that we can take it
[35:11] in our hearts
[35:50] what should I do
[36:04] [Music]
[36:16] this message
[36:19] s
[37:11] and this morning
[37:14] aren't you happy for that
[37:18] before that
[37:25] get to me you don't know if we are here
[37:26] I didn't come to him the prophet said
[37:30] no one seeks God
[37:33] is seeking bro he planted in the before
[37:38] the foundation of the world
[37:40] blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:43] because you weren't interested in God
[37:46] he was the one that was interested in
[37:48] you
[37:49] because a seed
[37:51] as it grows
[37:54] that eventually will give forth fruit
[37:56] amen amen
[38:00] as you start getting into the things of
[38:03] God
[38:05] and as you start living a different life
[38:10] your fruits are going to be different
[38:13] you're not gonna act like the way you
[38:15] used to act
[38:17] you're gonna act as a son and daughter
[38:19] of God
[38:21] that's the reason amen he chose you but
[38:24] uh
[38:26] to be a son and daughter of God
[38:30] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:33] I mean you're happy this morning
[38:36] [Applause]
[38:39] you forgive me that I speak Spanish
[38:44] but thank the Lord
[38:47] I mean this brother speaks Spanish very
[38:50] well as well
[38:53] brother
[39:01] praise the Lord
[39:04] and Tom says
[39:07] so as I said
[39:12] infinito plan God In His Infinite plan
[39:17] he thought of you
[39:19] and me he thought of me
[39:25] because even while we were in in sins
[39:32] and and uh in our downfalls
[39:37] he chose us he chose us
[39:41] for what
[39:44] to be for eternal life
[39:47] for eternal life
[39:51] have you ever asked yourself Senor Lord
[39:55] I want to have eternal life
[39:59] have you ever asked that
[40:05] now why does the question come
[40:09] on
[40:11] why does that question come to you
[40:15] you've paid your
[40:17] tithesis you've obeyed the Lord but
[40:21] why does that question come to you
[40:27] something to think about
[40:33] why do I ask myself
[40:36] do I have eternal life
[40:43] amen
[40:46] now when that question comes to you
[40:50] we should have we should be very careful
[40:54] very careful
[40:59] Judas had the the greatest Master around
[41:03] him Pedro Peter Los Apostles all the
[41:06] apostles he used to be they had the
[41:09] master with them
[41:14] they faced eternal life uh personally
[41:19] mentiros Peter well maybe was a liar you
[41:24] know and what about us
[41:26] what are we
[41:31] have we denied the Lord yes see yeah
[41:37] the Lord Jesus Christ knows
[41:43] when Peter was very excited
[41:48] and he told Jesus he said I'll go with
[41:50] you until death
[41:51] I'm gonna defend you Lord
[41:57] in in his own desires he tried
[42:02] he wanted to defend the Lord
[42:06] but all
[42:08] um
[42:09] May the Lord Jesus told him he said look
[42:11] Peter
[42:13] you're going to deny me
[42:20] and so the question is that that's the
[42:24] that's where the question comes
[42:28] how many times have we in our life to
[42:30] denied the Lord
[42:34] and your own Natural Life
[42:39] I see older people here
[42:43] I see young people here
[42:46] maybe you ask yourselves the question
[42:51] do I have eternal life
[42:56] all right now look
[43:02] when Peter was with God
[43:04] I mean when Peter was with the Lord
[43:09] he didn't know
[43:11] Pedro no Sabia he didn't know
[43:14] you know why
[43:17] because he didn't have the Holy Spirit
[43:21] he didn't have the Holy Spirit but
[43:26] in his own desires in his own impulses
[43:33] he said I'm gonna fight for you Lord
[43:36] Jesus
[43:38] but when the Lord Jesus told him Peter
[43:41] you're going to deny him oh Lord I will
[43:44] never do that no
[43:48] so the doubt comes
[43:52] in his mind
[43:57] what is it that you fight with
[44:00] you
[44:02] fight demons
[44:05] day by day
[44:08] by the grace of God
[44:11] we're here this morning
[44:13] by the grace of God it is by nothing
[44:17] else but by the grace of God
[44:21] and so when you overcame
[44:24] this morning
[44:29] all kinds of different things
[44:33] this morning you're facing eternal life
[44:40] you have it before you in French
[44:45] and you say Lord
[44:47] I'm going I'm serving you today with all
[44:51] of my heart I'm going to serve you with
[44:55] all of my heart but maybe tomorrow
[44:58] we forget
[45:00] of our promise that we made the Lord
[45:04] you remember that when Peter was there
[45:09] he was hiring himself
[45:13] aren't you one of the ones that are
[45:15] following Jesus no no
[45:18] no
[45:22] and do you know why they recognize him
[45:26] because of the way he dressed see yeah
[45:30] and so you and I
[45:33] Patron we have we have a pattern
[45:58] because that's going to help you
[46:01] that's going to help you
[46:03] so but it's a it's a choice
[46:07] you can do it you can do it
[46:11] any man
[46:38] as the prophet teaches us
[46:42] maybe he left school University
[46:46] his parents taught him good things
[46:52] and when he finished what he was trying
[46:55] to finish
[46:57] he ended up with a lot of money
[47:01] so the Bible that's why the Bible calls
[47:04] in the Rich Young Ruler
[47:08] now when he came to face to face with
[47:11] eternal life
[47:12] because Jesus is eternal life amen amen
[47:15] Jesus is
[47:18] eternal life
[47:19] because he said I am the way the truth
[47:22] in the life
[47:27] and death can't dwell with eternal life
[47:31] so us
[47:33] a
[47:35] we have come face to face with
[47:39] eternal life
[47:41] in our in our walk
[47:44] in our daily life
[48:16] even if you're young or if you're older
[48:22] the devil doesn't care about ages
[48:26] the devil doesn't care about that
[48:29] what he cares about is to be able to
[48:32] derail you
[48:34] derail your mind first
[48:36] because Paul said every day
[48:41] we have to renew hey
[49:13] the name of the Lord move in amen
[49:24] [Music]
[49:25] maybe I went ahead a little bit but
[49:30] I want you to see this
[49:34] the the word confront
[49:38] they say is
[49:43] facing someone or something expensive
[49:48] especially in a challenge
[49:50] in La Vida
[49:52] is
[49:55] in life it's inevitable for you to have
[49:59] to face uh to come face to face with
[50:02] some things in life
[50:08] dominance we confront our fears so that
[50:11] we don't allow them to dominate us
[50:20] we confront error because ignoring it
[50:24] might do us wrong might do us bad Jesus
[50:28] confrontations
[50:32] Jesus had several confrontations with
[50:34] those who were coming against him
[50:45] the apostles and the prophets in the
[50:48] bible they felt that they uh forced to
[50:51] confront themselves
[50:55] being that their message would bother
[50:58] the people
[51:00] is that correct
[51:02] util
[51:06] confrontation can be good or could also
[51:08] be bad
[51:12] depending the situation
[51:16] respect and the Bible gives examples of
[51:19] this
[51:20] [Music]
[51:24] confrontation is motivated by pride
[51:28] and and wrong desire
[51:32] or other carnal desires okay
[51:41] those that confront others were in order
[51:44] to to be able to to win some favor for
[51:47] themselves
[51:51] or to seem like they're better than
[51:54] someone else
[51:57] they're abusing that art of
[51:59] Confrontation Las Vegas
[52:08] Street Wars start when a leader of a of
[52:13] a gang leader starts promise with
[52:15] another one teclado
[52:27] social media Wars start when one starts
[52:31] with another one and
[52:33] on that on those platforms you know what
[52:36] I'm talking about
[52:43] you're not yeah
[52:48] you're not gaining anything with these
[52:51] confrontations because your motives are
[52:53] are are are are are are just dealing
[52:57] just with you
[53:04] Jesus many times was an object of a
[53:06] confrontation
[53:08] confrontations
[53:13] while he was preaching and teaching in
[53:16] Judea
[53:18] Los principales
[53:21] the main the the priests
[53:25] and the Pharisees
[53:28] we're motivated by pride and fear
[53:36] and the fact that they didn't know what
[53:39] was going on and the desire to be able
[53:41] to
[53:43] say
[53:46] and that's why they felt offended
[53:49] what Jesus would say and do yeah
[53:55] and they will take advantage of any
[53:58] opportunity to confront him so
[54:00] confrontation
[54:02] and his last confrontation finished was
[54:06] on his crucifixion
[54:11] in history and human history
[54:14] the greatest crime of human history
[54:18] now watch
[54:21] the prophet teaches us
[54:24] he tells us
[54:27] everything that we do
[54:30] that we do wrong
[54:34] when we know better
[54:59] we have to be very careful
[55:02] because this is like this is like a
[55:04] thread El Diablos
[55:07] Devo wants to cut it
[55:09] and he wants to disconnect us amen amen
[55:22] and
[55:29] once you're disconnected
[55:32] you're running desperately
[55:35] but your threat has been cut
[55:39] and so when you come to desperation
[55:42] right
[55:44] I'm going to say it this way
[55:48] many people lose children
[55:52] what can you do
[55:56] you can get desperate you can cry you
[55:59] can you can do whatever
[56:02] you will never begin to get him back he
[56:05] will never come back aura
[56:10] now to cut the communication con dios
[56:13] with God yes Amor that who is love
[56:18] who cuts that communication El Diablo
[56:21] the devil our enemy
[56:26] and so how are we are going to confront
[56:29] eternal life
[56:31] because all the things of this life is
[56:34] they're wanting to trap us
[56:37] especially social media
[56:41] social media is one of the most
[56:43] dangerous things
[56:52] is allowing spiritual death in people
[56:56] so we want to confront or come face to
[56:59] face with eternal life
[57:01] when we can't it is
[57:04] sometimes there's no remedy for it
[57:08] anymore
[57:08] there's no remedies
[57:11] because you are cut yeah
[57:14] you have no connection
[57:19] so that's why the devil wants Brothers
[57:21] to just fight with them
[57:23] once it's separated from fellowshipping
[57:31] but that's why we're here this morning
[57:34] we're Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:37] to come together
[57:41] eternal life or face to face eternal
[57:43] life
[57:45] because the majority is
[57:48] the greater power La Union the union
[57:51] it's great it's a greater power amen
[57:54] amen
[57:57] foreign
[57:59] let's read the uh what brother Brown
[58:02] says the message that God gave us is
[58:05] are you happy this morning
[58:09] blessed me in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:12] Christ
[58:15] Benson and the message come follow me
[58:22] paragraph 39.
[58:25] they said
[58:28] the Holy Spirit through brother Brown
[58:34] he says here let's look at this fellow
[58:37] for a few minutes
[58:38] that we read about
[58:40] no no I do that
[58:44] no doubt that this kid was born in a
[58:48] good home
[58:50] why is there no doubt about that
[58:53] because he was young he
[58:56] knew the Commandments he was rich
[59:01] and there was there was no doubt about
[59:03] that
[59:05] Nosotros cuantos enrichos how many are
[59:09] rich here
[59:10] how many are millionaires
[59:14] I'm a millionaire
[59:17] yeah
[59:19] Paul said that we're we're expensive in
[59:23] the eyes of God
[59:25] Amen we're expensive
[59:29] just one one soul
[59:32] that has repentance
[59:35] and saved
[59:37] how much is it worth Mazda yes more than
[59:41] ten thousand worlds
[59:45] you don't even that doesn't even cover
[59:47] half of the United States
[59:50] do you know more than ten thousand words
[59:53] that's that's your worth
[59:55] [Laughter]
[1:00:25] for gas
[1:00:30] a young man in our age
[1:00:33] but this young man he was rich he was he
[1:00:37] was wealthy but what he didn't have what
[1:00:42] he didn't know if he had or not if he
[1:00:45] had an eternal life or not
[1:00:48] and when you know that you have eternal
[1:00:50] life
[1:00:51] you're the most happiest person ever
[1:00:54] you're the most thankful person brother
[1:00:57] Branham says
[1:01:00] that you're waiting for the doors
[1:01:02] so that you can come worship
[1:01:40] the good worshiper is the one that
[1:01:42] worships
[1:01:44] in every moment and in every place
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] are you with me okay all right let's
[1:01:54] continue
[1:01:56] I don't know how much time I have
[1:01:58] I'm just I'm just starting
[1:02:00] [Laughter]
[1:02:07] I normally reach back home about 35
[1:02:10] minutes so you don't worry
[1:02:19] so this is what we see when Jesus uh
[1:02:25] okay so no doubt that this kid was born
[1:02:29] in a good home like you kids are he was
[1:02:31] brought up with good parents
[1:02:33] because it proved that when Jesus
[1:02:35] presented to him the Commandments of God
[1:02:40] Esso
[1:02:42] is
[1:02:48] he he said I've kept these since youth
[1:02:51] it showed that he had been he had been
[1:02:54] brought up right this is
[1:02:57] the prophet uses this word he wasn't
[1:03:00] just a snatch out
[1:03:07] you know he had been brought up to know
[1:03:10] what's right
[1:03:13] kids like you all are problems
[1:03:20] probably come up under a God-fearing
[1:03:23] Mother and Daddy okay
[1:03:27] to teach him right
[1:03:30] when he was a kid
[1:03:33] that's what I like is
[1:03:36] you instruct a child in the way
[1:03:40] now when we're talking about a child
[1:03:46] I believe it's not just a a little
[1:03:49] newborn
[1:03:51] and you come to the knowledge of the
[1:03:54] world
[1:03:55] come to this glorious message you are a
[1:03:59] child you're a child this is
[1:04:02] an instructor is a child in the way that
[1:04:05] is
[1:04:07] in the natural you could you can do it
[1:04:11] is
[1:04:16] to go that when he gets older he shall
[1:04:20] not depart
[1:04:29] in our life
[1:04:32] there's not one
[1:04:35] but the life that has been given us
[1:04:39] that that teaching that has been taught
[1:04:41] us that won't go away from us
[1:04:44] and each one of us that have backslips
[1:04:47] we have to return
[1:04:50] we have to return favorite man
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:55] why
[1:04:56] do we have to return
[1:04:58] because it's part of the plan of God
[1:05:01] it's part of God's perfect plan
[1:05:06] in this day
[1:05:09] we were predestinated in this in this
[1:05:13] age for what
[1:05:16] to manifest
[1:05:18] and to be manifested as Sons and
[1:05:21] Daughters
[1:05:25] he said we are waiting
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:35] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:39] now this young man
[1:05:42] because of his riches
[1:05:46] he didn't want to accept eternal life
[1:05:49] he was before eternal life and he
[1:05:53] rejected it
[1:05:56] he had three more agents acceptor he he
[1:06:00] was gonna accept
[1:06:02] and as he accepted
[1:06:06] he had to obey what the eternal life was
[1:06:08] telling him
[1:06:09] what was the eternal life telling him
[1:06:13] go sell everything that you have
[1:06:16] now what do you have
[1:06:19] what do you have to sell
[1:06:22] lucky let me tell you that each and
[1:06:24] every one of you
[1:06:25] nothing is free
[1:06:29] but the Lord Jesus said
[1:06:32] come and buy Cindy without money and
[1:06:36] without price
[1:06:59] brother and sister
[1:07:02] the devil has not given us anything free
[1:07:07] the devil never tells you anything for
[1:07:10] free or gives you anything for free now
[1:07:13] you have to just go ahead and just give
[1:07:14] it back to him
[1:07:16] and this is not mine
[1:07:19] all these wrong desires
[1:07:22] all these bad actions
[1:07:26] so I just give them back to you Satan
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:08:10] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:16] in paragraph 40
[1:08:19] is
[1:08:25] um in the same in the same uh quote
[1:08:27] maybe his mom had great Ambitions
[1:08:30] Ambitions for him
[1:08:33] how many mothers here how many are
[1:08:36] mothers who have children
[1:08:39] you as mothers
[1:08:42] you want the best for your children
[1:08:45] right
[1:08:46] you want your children to be the best
[1:08:50] especially since we recognize this
[1:08:53] message
[1:09:00] he's come to try to steal that away from
[1:09:03] us
[1:09:03] mentally yeah spiritually

[1:10:00] an obedient boy
[1:10:03] pero but

[1:10:15] experience I want to have my own
[1:10:16] experience
[1:10:18] I want to feel it for myself
[1:10:22] this is
[1:10:24] that broke my heart so much
[1:10:27] this is he said
[1:10:32] I don't want you to come knock the door
[1:10:37] and tell me
[1:10:40] let's go to church
[1:10:44] don't come knocking my door like that
[1:10:46] anymore
[1:10:47] how do you think I felt when he told me
[1:10:49] that
[1:10:53] now
[1:10:57] us being parents
[1:11:01] that the lord lord Jesus said
[1:11:05] you're good parents
[1:11:07] you've given everything to your children
[1:11:10] we're not going to give them a stone
[1:11:12] instead of bread
[1:11:16] you're not going to give them a snake
[1:11:18] instead of a fish that's right
[1:11:21] you're going to give them the best
[1:11:26] and how much our heavenly father
[1:11:30] that he loves us
[1:11:34] and so what you love
[1:11:37] and when you tell
[1:11:40] say those things
[1:11:42] how do you think you feel
[1:11:48] so our heavenly father
[1:11:51] how do you think he feels when you tell
[1:11:53] him
[1:11:54] when one of his children
[1:11:57] when one of his children
[1:12:01] has rejected his word
[1:12:05] how do you think he feels
[1:12:12] now do we really need an experience see
[1:12:15] yeah
[1:12:16] we need it
[1:12:19] either whether you're young
[1:12:24] and your experience
[1:12:30] the new birth
[1:12:35] and so when you know have the new birth
[1:12:40] your nature changes
[1:12:56] he's the one that
[1:13:03] teaches us
[1:13:05] of what we need to do
[1:13:08] and during
[1:13:11] Como Padre as a father
[1:13:16] you bring your child to church at 10
[1:13:18] years old eight years old
[1:13:22] come on
[1:13:24] let's go to church
[1:13:26] and because they want to obey
[1:13:29] let's go
[1:13:31] but really do they really want to come
[1:13:34] yeah
[1:13:37] foreign
[1:13:40] let's ask ourselves as parents
[1:13:44] do our children really
[1:13:47] if they haven't really had that
[1:13:49] experience in their life
[1:13:51] and if you haven't experienced that in
[1:13:54] your life
[1:13:55] ask them that before
[1:13:57] the devil takes them
[1:14:00] it's hard
[1:14:05] you know you just look at the prophet's
[1:14:07] life
[1:14:08] how he felt
[1:14:11] how did Brother Branham feel
[1:14:15] him being the servant of God
[1:14:20] can you imagine that
[1:14:23] all eyes were on him
[1:14:25] we're on the servant of the Lord yes
[1:14:28] yes
[1:14:41] a leader at church and what can you do
[1:14:44] you know
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:58] what you say
[1:15:00] is
[1:15:01] what your children are going to do
[1:15:05] when the Lord
[1:15:08] deals
[1:15:09] with your heart or whatever
[1:15:13] because the the steps of a good song are
[1:15:17] ordered by who
[1:15:19] are ordered by God
[1:15:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:15:28] I don't think I'm gonna finish
[1:15:31] but I think we have two Services right
[1:15:33] right okay all right
[1:15:38] Lord Jesus allows we might continue this
[1:15:40] afternoon
[1:15:42] in in paragraph 41 continuing to read
[1:15:45] here in the same message
[1:15:51] with him praying constant the men
[1:15:54] constantly
[1:15:57] so that your so that their son would not
[1:16:00] be just a common boy see see
[1:16:04] but an extraordinary young man
[1:16:08] that is what every parent would want
[1:16:11] is
[1:16:16] did you hear Jesus as he referred to
[1:16:19] that commandment
[1:16:21] honor your father and mother
[1:16:24] and so he's he stood there yes
[1:16:31] and that is the ambition of any father
[1:16:36] do the best he can for his children to
[1:16:40] educate them
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:44] to maybe even give them the things that
[1:16:48] they themself have themselves had
[1:16:52] and that's how I feel with my children
[1:16:59] sometimes I think about going to school
[1:17:03] and I sent Becky and I sent Sarah Jose
[1:17:06] and Joseph is
[1:17:08] to these to these schools
[1:17:13] and all these places where all these bad
[1:17:16] behaviors
[1:17:20] I would rather just take them up in a
[1:17:23] mountain somewhere
[1:17:27] and raise them up there with the Indians
[1:17:31] but this is the thing this is the thing
[1:17:34] watch what the prophet says here
[1:17:38] what is in this in the in the child
[1:17:41] is going to come out no important
[1:17:44] doesn't matter where he is
[1:17:47] that
[1:17:49] is going to come out
[1:17:52] if there's wickedness there that's
[1:17:55] what's going to come out
[1:17:56] and even in the Indian Camp if I
[1:17:59] suggested if he's going to be
[1:18:08] so you see Aura now watch
[1:18:13] social media
[1:18:17] I have heard
[1:18:20] Hombres
[1:18:22] older man
[1:18:25] I have rejected this message
[1:18:28] why
[1:18:42] 40 years
[1:18:47] how many years did Moses walk in the
[1:18:49] desert
[1:18:54] how many
[1:18:59] cuantos cuantos Dias
[1:19:04] and the prophet says how much time do
[1:19:07] they have to get to the promised land in
[1:19:09] reality
[1:19:11] just a short time
[1:19:14] that's how we are
[1:19:16] now we think
[1:19:18] we're 40 years into this
[1:19:22] and we're just the best of the best
[1:19:27] when you start thinking like that
[1:19:31] you're the most miserable one
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:08] when we see that it's old
[1:20:12] when we see that maybe it's not running
[1:20:14] anymore
[1:20:19] likes to make you look like junk
[1:20:23] in your mind
[1:20:36] our mind our spirit
[1:20:38] is
[1:20:41] when you have those tools available
[1:20:47] you're good to go
[1:20:50] you're good to go
[1:20:53] but you need
[1:20:58] this message is to what to restore
[1:21:02] is
[1:21:04] that's why God sent this message and
[1:21:07] what was he going to restore
[1:21:10] this restaurant
[1:21:12] it was going to restore something that
[1:21:14] was already kind of a junkie
[1:21:17] Hermanos amen
[1:21:20] you're a child of God you're his
[1:21:23] daughter of God
[1:21:27] while you're facing
[1:21:29] eternal life face to face on a daily
[1:21:31] basis
[1:21:33] Jesus told this young man
[1:21:35] go sell everything that you have give it
[1:21:39] to the poor Ben and then come is follow
[1:21:43] me every week
[1:21:46] yeah no no Diario he said daily come
[1:21:51] follow me
[1:21:55] and to serve God daily is to live a life
[1:22:00] that is worth where there's worth more
[1:22:03] than yes the ten thousand worlds
[1:22:07] and when the people say

[1:22:13] look at that nice hair you have estas
[1:22:16] are you walking are you preaching

[1:23:06] and let me just read you this last one
[1:23:12] stand to your feet have the musicians
[1:23:15] come
[1:23:27] and the prophet continues here asking
[1:23:29] this question do you know something
[1:23:38] 86 of conversions to Jesus Christ who
[1:23:41] said
[1:23:42] happened before the 21 years old
[1:23:48] that's what it shows
[1:23:50] statistics that's what statistics show
[1:23:53] that's what the the statistics
[1:23:56] shows
[1:23:59] 86 of those that come to Christ
[1:24:03] come before they're 21.
[1:24:08] once you're out you're past that age
[1:24:12] you're more molded or hardened in your
[1:24:17] ways

[1:24:26] whether it's 70 or or when they come to
[1:24:29] 70 or 80 years old
[1:24:31] they come in but sometimes it's it's
[1:24:34] it's not it's strange for that to happen
[1:24:40] now if the Lord has called us
[1:24:43] what has he called us to
[1:24:47] are you in German there is a calling me
[1:24:51] come unto me
