[0:01] okay
[0:24] good morning good morning
[0:34] brother anderson said he's got the best
[0:37] today so
[0:40] yeah brother boy's got the flu jeffrey's
[0:42] got the blue so
[0:45] today i want to continue my talk on that
[0:48] token
[0:49] so open your bibles to chapter 12
[0:53] and verse 12
[0:54] and 13. what
[1:08] exodus 12
[1:10] verse 12 13.
[1:16] i said for i will pass through the land
[1:18] of egypt this night and i will smite all
[1:20] that
[1:21] firstborn the land of egypt that both
[1:23] men and beasts and against all the gods
[1:25] of egypt
[1:27] and i will execute judgment i am the
[1:29] lord
[1:30] the blood shall be unto you for token
[1:33] upon the houses where you are when i see
[1:35] the blood i will pass over you and the
[1:37] plagues shall not be upon you to destroy
[1:40] you when i smite the land of egypt
[1:45] but god called moses he told and go tell
[1:47] pharaoh does say the god of the hebrews
[1:49] let my people go if you won't let them
[1:51] go
[1:52] throw down your stick and it will become
[1:54] a serpent and if you won't believe the
[1:56] first sign then do this other side
[1:59] i'm just kind of backing up a little bit
[2:01] uh the message uh take the rod and get
[2:04] other people 1950 brother said
[2:07] the rod that moses had in his hand was
[2:09] not the rod of moses it was the
[2:12] rod of god
[2:14] god's judgment
[2:16] that moses held it
[2:18] over egypt and flies came and it brought
[2:22] judgment upon a
[2:23] disobedient people and the rod was
[2:26] christ the substitute for sin and
[2:28] sickness
[2:31] let me read a little something about
[2:33] the
[2:34] pharaohs it said that ancient egyptians
[2:37] believed that the pharaoh was a living
[2:39] god
[2:40] the affair had pharaoh had total
[2:43] authority
[2:44] he was in charge of the army treasury
[2:47] justice and in egypt
[2:49] they said to help the pharaohs rule they
[2:51] were
[2:52] many government
[2:53] officials and scribes
[2:56] ramses ii
[2:58] reigned for 67 years how do you like to
[3:00] have a president for them for that long
[3:04] oh my lord
[3:13] and the message the token
[3:16] february 1964
[3:18] brother brown said
[3:22] he said the life was going on from the
[3:24] sacrifice and now the blood was a token
[3:26] his orders had been carried out
[3:28] that's that's what it was in egypt that
[3:30] dreadful night just before that struck
[3:33] the last plague
[3:34] god had shown his great signs and
[3:36] wonders in egypt
[3:38] he's known suffering kindness to pharaoh
[3:40] and all of his people he has sent many
[3:42] great signs through the land
[3:44] he sent them a prophet show them signs
[3:46] and wander the bill of fire all and all
[3:49] that
[3:50] that he had that he did and yet
[3:53] all that he did yet they would not
[3:54] repent they would not come to god they
[3:57] ignore all of his signs they ignored his
[3:59] prophet they ignored the message
[4:02] they wanted their own ways so god had
[4:04] been fed up with them so he said
[4:06] i'm going to make a separation now
[4:08] between those who do believe and those
[4:11] who do not believe
[4:12] he said i think we're living in that
[4:14] time now where god is making a choice
[4:17] men will believe or they won't believe
[4:19] amen all you got to do is look in the
[4:20] world and see what's going on
[4:24] and god required token and this person
[4:27] innocent land that he has substituted
[4:29] for dead in the garden of eden and now
[4:31] when the lamb was killed the blood was
[4:33] to be placed upon the door post and on
[4:36] the bento
[4:37] and it was to show that their
[4:39] requirement had been carried out
[4:43] i think that's a great lesson for us we
[4:45] look at it
[4:47] see they believe in worship
[4:49] as he identified by the token of their
[4:51] blood he had to
[4:53] the believer had to get the lamb slave
[4:55] the lamb a land for a house take the
[4:57] blood the history which is just that
[4:59] little brush that grows up there in the
[5:01] country and they come and wheeze and
[5:03] recall it and have to apply it
[5:05] show it by applying it out of the blood
[5:08] which the heads his hyssop represents
[5:10] faith
[5:12] but you guys should be bad i'm not going
[5:13] to use faith as a kingdom
[5:16] okay just check
[5:18] many times people think they have to
[5:21] to have us some supernatural faith to be
[5:23] a believer
[5:25] it isn't the hyssop speaks for that just
[5:27] coming weeds that you could get it
[5:29] anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood
[5:31] and apply the blood
[5:33] see the blood tonight is applied by this
[5:35] by simple faith
[5:37] just not
[5:38] nothing supernatural it's right around
[5:40] you everywhere just simply like a child
[5:43] reach out and get a hold of it and apply
[5:45] that blood
[5:46] the hyssop is just a simple child faith
[5:49] for the believer it isn't something out
[5:51] of your reach you don't have to reach
[5:53] very far to get it
[5:56] that history grows and that country goes
[5:58] out of the cracks of the walls a little
[6:00] kind of diamond shaped leaf you can pick
[6:03] it up anywhere just as a grass or whis
[6:05] would be
[6:06] in the country here now just pick it up
[6:08] apply it put it in the door that's the
[6:10] way faith is to be applied take faith
[6:13] rather and apply the blood of jesus
[6:15] christ
[6:16] by faith to the heart store
[6:18] this was going to separate and make the
[6:20] difference between those who were born
[6:23] out of egypt and those who were going to
[6:25] stay in egypt and perish with
[6:28] with egypt
[6:44] hmm
[6:48] same message
[6:51] now let's go to uh
[6:52] joshua
[6:54] chapter 2.
[7:04] somebody else applied a token to
[7:10] joshua
[7:13] joshua
[7:15] we're going to read the whole chapter
[7:20] chapter 2
[7:21] joshua 2 verse 1 and we're going to read
[7:24] the whole thing
[7:27] and joshua the son of nonsense
[7:31] two men to spy secretly saying go view
[7:33] the land even jericho and they went and
[7:36] came into a heartless house named rehab
[7:39] and lodged there and he was told the
[7:41] king on
[7:42] jericho saying behold there came man and
[7:45] hitler tonight
[7:47] tonight are the children of israel to
[7:49] search out the land
[7:51] and that king and jericho said until
[7:53] rehab saying bring forth the man that
[7:56] will come to thee which are entered into
[7:58] the house for they come to search out
[8:01] all the
[8:02] all the country and the woman took the
[8:04] two men and hit them and said thus
[8:06] there came man unto me but i wish not
[8:09] once they were and it came to pass about
[8:11] that time i shut another gate when
[8:14] it was dark that the man went out
[8:16] whether the man when i will not
[8:18] pursue after them quickly for you shall
[8:21] overtake them
[8:22] but she brought them up
[8:25] to the roof of the house and hit them
[8:27] with the stalks of flats which she had
[8:29] laid in order order upon the roof and a
[8:31] man pursued after them the way to jordan
[8:34] unto the fortress as soon as they
[8:38] which pursued after them were going on
[8:40] they shut the gate
[8:42] and before they were laid down they came
[8:45] up onto them upon the roof and she said
[8:47] unto them they met
[8:49] i know that the lord had given you the
[8:50] land and that your terror is falling
[8:52] upon us and that all the inhabitants of
[8:55] the man may be caused of you
[8:59] we have heard how the lord dried up the
[9:01] water of the red sea for you
[9:03] when you came out of egypt and what you
[9:05] did unto the two kings of the amorites
[9:08] that were on the other side of jordan
[9:11] see on and off
[9:14] whom you utterly destroyed
[9:17] and as soon as we heard these things our
[9:19] hearts did melt neither did there remain
[9:21] any more courage in any man because of
[9:24] you
[9:24] for the lord of god he is god in heaven
[9:27] above and earth
[9:29] below
[9:30] beneath so she is a believer now
[9:32] therefore i pray you sir unto me but the
[9:35] lord says i have shown you kindness that
[9:38] you will also show kindness
[9:40] onto my father's house
[9:42] and give me a true token
[9:46] and then you will save a lot it will
[9:49] save a life my father my mother and my
[9:52] brother my sister and all that they had
[9:54] and deliver our lives from dead
[9:58] and the man answered her
[9:59] our life for yours if you utter not this
[10:02] our business and they shall be when the
[10:04] lord had given us that land that we will
[10:06] deal kindly and truly with thee then she
[10:09] lit and she let them down by a cord
[10:11] through the window for her house was
[10:13] upon the
[10:15] town wall and she dwell upon that wall
[10:18] and she said unto them get you to the
[10:20] mountain list the pursuit meet you and
[10:22] hide yourself there three days until
[10:25] that pursuers be returned
[10:27] and afterward may you go your way
[10:29] and the man said unto her we will be
[10:32] blameless of that this thing oath
[10:35] which thou has made us swear
[10:38] behold when they come into the land thou
[10:40] shalt
[10:41] bind this line of scarlet threat and the
[10:44] window which this led us down by and
[10:47] thou
[10:48] shalt bring thy father and my mother and
[10:50] my brother and all that father
[10:53] home and to thee and it shall be that
[10:57] whosoever shall go out of the door of
[10:59] the house and to the street his blood
[11:01] shall be upon his head and we will
[11:04] be guiltless and whose server shall be
[11:06] with thee in the house
[11:08] his blood shall be on our head if any
[11:11] and be upon him without
[11:14] part of this or business then we will be
[11:18] quick quick assign both which that has
[11:20] made us to swear and she said according
[11:24] unto your words over here and she send
[11:26] them away and they parted and she bombed
[11:29] a started line in the window and they
[11:31] went and came out to the mountain
[11:34] and i bowed there three days until the
[11:36] pursuers were returned and the pursuers
[11:38] sought them throughout all the way but
[11:41] from them not
[11:42] so the two men returned and descended
[11:45] from the mountain
[11:46] and passed over and came to
[11:48] joshua the son of another told him all
[11:51] the things that dwell bewell then and
[11:54] they said unto joshua truly the lord had
[11:57] delivered unto our hands all the land
[12:00] for even all the inhabitants of the
[12:02] country thanked the god because of us
[12:06] by the way said even the whole town if
[12:08] they wanted to they could have come
[12:10] under her
[12:11] token and they would have been saved but
[12:13] they said they didn't
[12:15] you know
[12:18] the bottom of the scorpio said the the
[12:20] line now
[12:22] the scarlet liner rehab speaks by its
[12:25] color as safety through sacrifice so
[12:28] what this really means is redemption
[12:30] through the blood
[12:38] wow
[12:54] november 28 1963 stripper shreveport
[12:58] louisiana
[13:07] he said uh look at joshua and you read
[13:10] joshua the second chapter a guy who
[13:12] wrote down here really i haven't got the
[13:14] time but i want you to know when moses
[13:16] and joshua were on the road through the
[13:18] wilderness coming to the exodus they
[13:21] sent out some minister spies to go
[13:23] supply of the land
[13:25] and remember there was a gentile over on
[13:28] the other side
[13:29] of the river by the name i read she was
[13:31] a harlot
[13:33] poor kid must have been a street worker
[13:35] perhaps turned out by her parents
[13:38] but her family
[13:39] but we find out that when she's seeing
[13:42] those men and knew that they were
[13:45] man of god she she was a harlot and she
[13:47] wanted to know there could be any mercy
[13:50] god
[13:51] could be granted to her
[13:54] god gives mercy to those who call for
[13:56] mercy
[13:57] and all that call for mercy shall
[13:59] receive mercy amen
[14:04] she said
[14:05] i'll show kindness
[14:07] she didn't have to see joshua she didn't
[14:09] know the way he calmed his hair
[14:11] the clothes he was she said i have heard
[14:13] and god is with you
[14:15] that's all she wanted to know
[14:18] they saying this and they know she know
[14:20] it was the truth she asked for mercy
[14:23] what for both
[14:24] her and her family she asked for her and
[14:27] her family just like they did in egypt
[14:29] and notice it was given to her a token a
[14:32] red token
[14:34] that the scarlet strain that she let the
[14:36] people
[14:37] the spies down out of the window was to
[14:39] be a token
[14:40] god would not this destroy angel god the
[14:43] strong angel would not come
[14:46] near her as long as she had that token
[14:49] but
[14:50] and what if she said oh i'll let them
[14:53] down
[14:54] a good deed so now
[14:56] to keep anybody from criticizing me and
[14:58] seeing the scarlet
[15:00] rope hanging out there i'll just
[15:02] pull the rope back up
[15:04] then the judgment angel would have never
[15:06] passed over her house she had to have
[15:08] the token display it had to be
[15:11] had to remain there
[15:13] he said i believe that the scarlet
[15:14] threat had to be displayed or the angel
[15:16] destroying angel would have never
[15:18] honored anything else but that token
[15:21] when it was displayed the messengers
[15:24] gave her a token and she must keep it
[15:26] displayed
[15:27] said notice jericho had heard what god
[15:29] had done but did nothing to take the
[15:32] warning see they could have gone in
[15:35] but they didn't
[15:36] but one little harlot there must have
[15:38] been some
[15:39] tape boys
[15:40] i guess
[15:42] they don't have cds or whatever
[15:44] people
[15:45] slip in there and play some other tape
[15:48] that pretty destinated sheet caught it
[15:49] and believe it so anyhow they got in
[15:52] there
[15:53] for a message
[15:54] at church that night in her house to use
[15:57] the hospital church to receive the
[15:58] message
[16:00] he said oh god let us open our hearts
[16:02] and receive the message that jesus is
[16:04] alive tonight
[16:05] is right here among us he is the same
[16:08] yesterday to hear forever
[16:09] open your house and let the messenger
[16:12] the holy ghost come in
[16:14] and identify you by his own person
[16:17] the token is upon you
[16:19] then you don't have to take anybody
[16:21] else's word for it
[16:23] he is there to speak for himself and
[16:25] he's a word that's right it's got toka
[16:28] to identify his own
[16:31] own self she used her house for the
[16:33] messengers then she got
[16:35] all the city that we believe under the
[16:38] same token was probably not unbelievable
[16:40] and that's the way the church should be
[16:42] doing today getting everything that will
[16:44] believe under that token the token is
[16:47] the holy ghost just remember
[16:49] they must get
[16:50] under the holy ghost
[17:21] brother brandon said that did you know
[17:22] that blood speaks
[17:24] uh let's turn to
[17:27] genesis chapter four
[17:30] first
[17:37] nobody
[17:57] thank you
[18:14] wait a minute
[18:28] genesis chapter 4
[18:31] verse 10 and he said what has thou done
[18:34] the boys that have brothers
[18:36] blood cried unto me from the ground
[18:52] and the token message began november 20
[18:54] 1963
[19:05] he said
[19:07] paul tells us talking about speaking of
[19:09] the blood
[19:11] paul tells us that the blood speaks you
[19:13] believe that the blood speaks in genesis
[19:15] 4 1 or 4 10 god told ken he said
[19:18] where is your brother he said his blood
[19:20] has his voice the blood of his voice but
[19:24] his blood calls out against you
[19:27] he said uh
[19:31] he said now we also find in hebrews 12
[19:34] chapter 24 after offensive we go to
[19:36] hebrews 12 chapter
[19:39] chapter 12 and 24. first that the new
[19:42] testament the blood speaks better than
[19:44] things
[19:45] the blood is speaking and the blood has
[19:47] got a voice and the voice of the blood
[19:49] is a word
[19:50] that's what makes it whether it's right
[19:52] or wrong the word is identified by the
[19:54] voice of the blood the voice of the
[19:57] blood is the holy ghost that brings life
[19:59] it is life and it brings life to the
[20:01] word and it quickens it
[20:03] amen true the blood speaks it speaks a
[20:06] better thing
[20:08] the old testament the blood spoke of
[20:10] guilt in the new testament speaks of the
[20:12] redemption in the old testament
[20:16] it speaks of death and sorrow in the new
[20:18] testament speaks our resurrection in
[20:20] life it speaks of healing it speaks of
[20:23] joy speaks of power it speaks of life it
[20:26] speaks of heaven and that same blood
[20:28] that was shed upon the ground and called
[20:30] up after his dead
[20:32] brother or call out after his brother
[20:34] had killed him the blood of jesus christ
[20:37] covers all our sins and speaks
[20:40] peace and restoration and the power of
[20:42] life and the healing and all that
[20:43] redemption blessing that the blood was
[20:45] shed for
[20:46] it
[20:47] for
[21:01] hebrews 12.
[21:24] me
[21:41] 24 give us 12 24
[21:44] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[21:46] covenant to the blood of the sprinkling
[21:48] and speaking better thing than the able
[22:08] in the toku november 20 1963 brethren
[22:11] said today every church every individual
[22:14] cannot display the token of the holy
[22:16] ghost it's spiritually dying and will
[22:18] die
[22:22] say the order of the passover it must be
[22:23] a male sheep and he must be tested for
[22:26] 14 days what a perfect type of christ
[22:29] and to type a male a
[22:32] lamb he was tested for three and a half
[22:35] years of his ministry through critics
[22:38] but true proof to hold it fast to the
[22:41] father's word
[22:43] even the presence of satan he said it is
[22:46] written
