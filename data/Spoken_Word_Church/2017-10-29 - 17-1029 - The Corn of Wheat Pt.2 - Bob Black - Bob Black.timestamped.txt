[0:07] all right we're recorded I see so why I
[0:10] passed around that little corner wheat
[0:11] does everybody know why that's
[0:13] significant we're doing another job
[0:16] needs me for a minute I know all right
[0:17] there's a whole lot of parables in the
[0:20] Bible based on terrorism so that the
[0:24] corner weed is important because in this
[0:26] last day we're returning back to the
[0:29] original word the same word that was
[0:31] planted back when Jesus gave his life
[0:35] rose from the dead they play on the
[0:36] church at Pentecost and we're returning
[0:38] back to that same word where it's not
[0:40] it's not anything Harvard the same
[0:43] original word and we know that the
[0:46] church has grown as the word was eaten
[0:48] down to the seven churches through
[0:50] through man's ideas and started at
[0:53] nothing then I see in church where
[0:55] Constantine came in with his great robes
[0:57] and began to sway the people away from
[0:59] the original word and offered him land
[1:02] and things and and popularity showed
[1:06] them supernatural signs he said he saw a
[1:09] cross in the sky and all these four
[1:11] things that got the people's eyes off of
[1:13] the original Word and they began to look
[1:16] at other things that brother Ram talked
[1:18] about in the messages till harvest time
[1:20] where he laid out Satan schemes the same
[1:22] schemes that he used in the Garden of
[1:25] Eden they used with Constantine and he's
[1:27] using today to try to get people's minds
[1:29] off of the original order he uses the
[1:32] supernatural the things like that giving
[1:36] people a position in the church the same
[1:37] thing that Constantine did I'll make you
[1:39] a presbytery round make you a deacon
[1:42] I'll make you somebody big and and
[1:45] instead of relying on the power of God
[1:48] in his in his word people began to look
[1:52] at at that kind of thing supernatural
[1:56] evidences and and and anything that
[1:58] would deviate away from the original
[2:00] word but the Bible says and Joel that
[2:03] God would restore I will restore saith
[2:05] the Lord that he would send a message
[2:08] through
[2:09] and through a restorative ministry
[2:11] through Martin Luther and John Wesley
[2:13] and then my message and where the
[2:16] homeless himself came at Pentecost and
[2:18] began to restore the gifts back in the
[2:20] church but then finally in the last day
[2:22] God would send a prophet with the
[2:25] headstone I've had stolen message to
[2:27] restore all the distrained everything
[2:29] back in the church so that the church
[2:32] would be prepared for the headstone to
[2:34] come down there wouldn't be one word off
[2:36] the the church the bride will be
[2:39] restored all the way back to the
[2:40] original seat but to know what to know
[2:44] what the corn of wheat looks like you
[2:46] got to know what the original corn of
[2:48] wheat looks like I tried and their
[2:49] original corn of wheat was Jesus Christ
[2:52] and the fullness he was the fullness of
[2:54] the Godhead Bobby all wrapped up always
[2:57] would say like this bottled up within
[2:59] that man and everything that makes God
[3:01] God was bottled up in that man because
[3:04] that's who he was
[3:05] now that was the original corn of wheat
[3:07] that's gonna be the corn of wheat in
[3:10] this day because in in the bride God
[3:12] will put himself the fullness of the
[3:14] Godhead falling back into the church
[3:16] again because the word will be restored
[3:18] and because you as you receive the word
[3:21] as you eat the word you become the word
[3:24] and that's what's happening today the
[3:25] bride is becoming the word and and
[3:28] through through that that wheat plant
[3:30] the wheat plant I think we sometimes we
[3:34] get into our heads you know we're
[3:35] looking at that show but Shooks not part
[3:37] of the show it's not that corn so we
[3:39] just toss them out well no now see the
[3:42] word of the life of God wasn't moving
[3:45] through that plan gone down through the
[3:47] seven churches so in the time of the of
[3:50] the stalk but the time of the little of
[3:53] the tassel that was the word for their
[3:56] day their part of the wheat plant we
[3:58] can't toss them out yes sir
[4:00] but remember one of the evidences of the
[4:01] new birth is that your life continues to
[4:04] move along get the word that bride is
[4:07] moving along and if you stagnate and you
[4:09] stay with the shook instead of let move
[4:13] alone to the kernel of wheat then you
[4:16] what you what happens is you de nominate
[4:18] and you die so that's what we mean when
[4:20] we say that the show that that in this
[4:23] day you're not supposed to be the shuck
[4:25] anymore the life is moving on into the
[4:28] kernel which is and that's what program
[4:31] said would be so hard to tell the
[4:33] difference only the elect would be able
[4:35] to tell because the elect knows what the
[4:37] word is she has become the word and will
[4:39] say that the elect can't be deceived now
[4:42] that's a strong statement because
[4:43] there's meaning today that may not have
[4:45] grown into the full stature and you know
[4:49] you you're you're gonna be deceived if
[4:51] you have not eaten the word that are you
[4:54] you're susceptible to being deceived if
[4:56] you have not received the word if you
[4:58] don't understand or know what the
[5:00] Bible's teaching a beat if you're not
[5:03] equipped to combat the schemes of the
[5:06] devil to know how to withstand his
[5:09] schemes and but when you have eaten the
[5:12] word and you've grown up into a
[5:14] Christian then you're able to see like
[5:17] like Peter said you're able to see far
[5:19] off you're going up the statue of
[5:20] perfect man you have vision where you
[5:22] can see from the top of the mountain
[5:24] you're able to see the schemes of the
[5:26] devils and understand I understand and
[5:28] you and and then you're coming into a
[5:30] man that cannot leave deceit and that's
[5:33] what the bride is going to be so I've
[5:38] got a lot of slides to kind of look
[5:41] through that that's pretty much what I'm
[5:43] gonna be talking about this morning I
[5:45] want to lay the graph of the framework
[5:46] and you know if you can kind of see the
[5:48] pattern now what the Scriptures talking
[5:51] about it helps us to understand and you
[5:53] know that that corner of wheat is so
[5:55] important because you can get in this
[5:57] day especially you can get deceived into
[5:59] thinking well let's just uh I got the
[6:01] new birth because I've got emotions and
[6:04] all those things but it goes back to the
[6:06] word it's got to be that that little
[6:08] corn of wheat is the word expressed and
[6:11] you know some point away you can you can
[6:13] play it in the ground
[6:13] come up because it's not fertilizer
[6:15] that's why he's gotta be the spirit and
[6:18] the truth of me and not just the truth
[6:21] the letter on the paper
[6:22] you know like brother branham explained
[6:24] it in the rising of the Sun and a lot of
[6:26] those messages about how how Jesus's
[6:28] body was laying that was the body of
[6:30] Jesus it after he had died and when his
[6:32] soul went to hell it was laying there in
[6:34] the tomb the spirit had to come and
[6:37] quicken that body and raise it up after
[6:39] without the spirit that it's just dead
[6:41] letter on the page and that's what we
[6:43] need is that there knowing it going
[6:44] there no one comes it will make the word
[6:46] fulfill exactly what it's supposed to do
[6:49] for that day spirit and truth going
[6:52] together so that's what we're looking at
[6:54] a picture from the National Geographic
[6:56] where they took a picture some people in
[6:58] the Middle East harvest in the week the
[7:00] week and eat that just what I was
[7:03] talking about this each one of these
[7:04] little wheat plants this is what God has
[7:06] done he planted himself he planted the
[7:09] church of the day of Pentecost the
[7:10] church grew up through this whole wheat
[7:12] plant the whole wheat plant is it is a
[7:14] type of the Bride of Christ I'm sure he
[7:17] can't throw out the whole wheat plant
[7:19] but eat in each age in each age where
[7:22] each messenger came and delivered his
[7:24] message you got to receive the word for
[7:26] your day and that makes you part of that
[7:29] that the right part of that planet for
[7:31] your day
[7:32] thereby understating I find that when
[7:36] the Spirit makes it live and we talked
[7:38] about this last time that the if it's a
[7:40] genuine spirit anointing the genuine
[7:42] genuine see they can't do nothing but
[7:44] bear a son or daughter of God the
[7:47] genuine spirit on the cocklebur seen a
[7:49] cocklebur seed will make it live just
[7:52] the same as it falls upon a week and
[7:54] makes italy of the spirit upon whether
[7:56] it'll it'll make it come to life the
[8:02] germ with the flesh I'm just kind of
[8:03] gonna go through some of these because
[8:05] it's talking about the the anointed Word
[8:08] but will produce the Word of God made
[8:10] manifest and and you any pet today
[8:13] people you know think about when when
[8:15] did Christ become anointed if Christ
[8:17] there at
[8:18] the River Galilee was the anointed word
[8:21] and and will say well he wasn't he
[8:23] wasn't anointed until the spirit fill on
[8:25] him you know we got to place that
[8:27] exactly right but that doesn't mean that
[8:29] he wasn't God until the end because then
[8:31] nor did Christ the pillar of fire was
[8:34] anointed before the foundation of the
[8:36] world he was anointed when he came forth
[8:38] and began to speak the world into
[8:39] existence I mean how do we say he was
[8:41] anointed because that was the Spirit of
[8:44] God making the word come to pass when he
[8:46] said let there be light that was the
[8:48] word going for his book words but his
[8:50] spirit was there to make it manifest and
[8:53] I you know there's so many that you look
[8:56] around and begin to hear people today
[8:57] struggling with so many things trying to
[9:00] struggling with the young people
[9:03] struggling with with different things
[9:04] thoughts and things that the devil puts
[9:06] on them but there is there's more to the
[9:09] message than just the philosophy just
[9:10] letters on a page man there is a power
[9:13] than a man Liberty but it can come upon
[9:15] the seat it's not it's not just knowing
[9:17] about facts about something but there is
[9:19] a power behind it if you could open up
[9:21] the door of faith and let God come in
[9:23] you know quick in the word and it'll
[9:24] make it manifest in your life there is
[9:27] an actual power I mean I just tell you a
[9:31] little testimony we were down there a
[9:32] ton at the meetings in Louisiana and and
[9:37] I I went up with other ministers and we
[9:38] had the prayer line and everything and
[9:40] after the after there it was all over
[9:41] moving back to the car and just such a
[9:44] great anointing came down and and we got
[9:50] back to the hotel and I just such a
[9:54] great anointing I could not even I
[9:55] couldn't get even get out of car and
[9:57] Monica went she just went on in the
[10:01] hotel and I was in the car praising the
[10:02] Lord yeah and Joe and some of the others
[10:06] were there out there and they said
[10:07] where's my bag he's still out in the car
[10:08] praise of the Lord so but while all that
[10:11] was going on I you know the thought came
[10:15] to me I was quoting scripture and
[10:17] shouting and having a good old time and
[10:19] ended up stagger in the parking lot like
[10:21] like on the day of Pentecost but I I
[10:23] began to think well all that was
[10:26] happening
[10:26] that same anointing could fall upon
[10:29] someone but they don't have any kind of
[10:31] work they don't know they haven't been
[10:34] taught
[10:34] there's nothing they're too quick and
[10:36] all they all they know is that it's a
[10:38] great experience and that's what that's
[10:40] what's so confusing in this day that
[10:43] Jeannie one presence of the Holy Ghost
[10:45] could fall upon you but not quickly to
[10:48] not get down on the inside of your soul
[10:51] now on the other hand we want to be
[10:54] anointed we want to be anointed
[10:56] Christians we're that we we open the
[10:59] door so that God can have his way in our
[11:01] life and you know you get out and work
[11:03] and and and think you kind of get your
[11:06] garments dirty and you we gotta get you
[11:09] get home and you want to get along with
[11:11] God and you maybe you start getting
[11:13] upset at people and everything and if
[11:14] why don't they do this whatever get
[11:16] alone with God a little bit me you let
[11:18] him fresh in your experience and he was
[11:21] sweet in your spirit so you won't be all
[11:22] drawn up in salary anymore he'll it'll
[11:25] make you different because it's the
[11:27] power of God the power of a resurrected
[11:29] life in you and where was that
[11:37] there's a there's a power that's there
[11:40] to deliver us and change us and you know
[11:42] that's really what the hope the message
[11:44] is about delivering us from the things
[11:47] of the world it's not so much you know
[11:49] we but there's a lot of things to learn
[11:53] that seems a real complicated sometimes
[11:55] and difficult but the substance of the
[11:58] essence of the message in that Daniel 17
[12:00] we because Christ the mystery God
[12:02] revealed everything is that they're
[12:04] redemptive power of God can take you
[12:06] from the things of the world and change
[12:08] you and make you like you and that's
[12:11] that's it summed up the problem is that
[12:13] we we don't believe that we failed we
[12:15] failed our flus Ross stuffed-up stopped
[12:18] up we can't reach out and claim it and
[12:20] just accept what God has done for us
[12:22] everything from marriage and divorce you
[12:24] know people people end up with with
[12:26] horrible circumstances in their life
[12:28] they make mistakes and things you know
[12:30] the worst marriage and divorce situation
[12:32] was
[12:33] they're in the Garden of Eden that's
[12:34] that was so horrible and attend today we
[12:36] put we put that family on the Jerry
[12:38] Springer Show or something that was such
[12:41] a mixed up horrible situation but God
[12:44] gave the grace of marriage and divorce -
[12:46] straight knoweth all that up and all all
[12:50] the grace that he's given to us to chop
[12:52] off our past seasons and and we're
[12:55] taking where you didn't even the real
[12:56] you didn't even do it as you come along
[12:58] to the opening of the work to the real
[13:00] you didn't even do it and all the stuff
[13:02] from this life is laid away laid back to
[13:06] where God has is sanctifying you and
[13:08] perfecting you and that's that's the
[13:11] grace of God that's what the message is
[13:13] about but you gotta have the word to
[13:17] understand that to know that you start
[13:20] off with the little facts and things
[13:21] that you can't quite put together then
[13:23] the Holy Spirit quick is it and he
[13:25] arranges it everything so that you can
[13:26] understand this you should see the
[13:28] pattern so you can see how everything is
[13:30] laid out and then that quickens your
[13:31] faith in you to realize that you're part
[13:34] of that corner week and then that
[13:36] quarter weed is in you and it all fits
[13:39] together into a one beautiful tapestry
[13:41] oh yeah well I've done like five slides
[13:46] so consumer this in here to show that
[13:50] the logo says the anointed that that
[13:52] manifestation of the word that's there
[13:54] knowing and then so who was that on the
[13:57] River Jordan that was that logos
[13:58] Tabernacle in flesh that God Himself
[14:05] Tavor like the soul of God in that man
[14:07] with the flues unstopped in a tabernacle
[14:11] in that man and then the anointing came
[14:13] down on him to quicken him into his
[14:14] ministry and to put him right into into
[14:17] preaching the gospel yes and and right
[14:19] after that anointing came down then the
[14:21] devil begins to test here so let's look
[14:23] at that what was what this man looked
[14:27] like now I know I know you people you
[14:29] start doing dry grams and there you know
[14:31] you get into some trouble
[14:33] you know we condense these things and
[14:35] inside one another everything but I want
[14:37] to look at it kind of like this because
[14:38] this is where we kind of get mixed up a
[14:40] lot of times what what kind of soul did
[14:43] Jesus Christ have there on the River
[14:45] Jordan
[14:45] was it was it somebody soul and then the
[14:48] spirit fellow and many became God or was
[14:51] it that low Gauss that was there from
[14:53] the we read that quote last night last
[14:55] time about how that was Jehovah lying in
[14:57] the manger
[14:58] that was Jehovah God even before the
[15:00] spirit of appointment and on the River
[15:02] Jordan and then that was that low gosh
[15:05] that pill or a fire that that person of
[15:07] who Jesus Christ he is not not just at
[15:11] the nature of the spirit but the so the
[15:14] person of who he is that's what the soul
[15:16] is right and and then what about the
[15:19] spirit now wasn't the spirit kind of
[15:21] like it needed a little bit help to kind
[15:23] of get all wound up because you know
[15:24] that's what the statue of a perfect man
[15:26] is doing for us is I'm blocking all the
[15:28] blues so that the soul of God has been
[15:31] birthed into you can have a have a way
[15:33] of escape I can have an exit so that
[15:36] that all that virtus you and everything
[15:37] can get out to dig up one another and
[15:39] build one another space then his spirit
[15:42] need unblocking or was it was it already
[15:45] blocked like it was when he when he
[15:47] turned the water into wine when he told
[15:50] he told it Mary said woe in my hour has
[15:52] not come but even before he went to the
[15:54] River Jordan he was he's he was turning
[15:58] water into wine because he he knew who
[16:00] he was he knew what is our would when he
[16:04] was gonna come how all he already knew
[16:06] all this oh oh oh the pattern of what
[16:09] his ministry he didn't he was there
[16:11] wasn't no I was wondering what was going
[16:13] on and when your flus get unblocked you
[16:16] begin to realize who you are and what
[16:18] the place is what your place is in that
[16:20] wheat plant so spirit but body he was a
[16:26] man yes he was he was born she came
[16:29] through a woman and and like think about
[16:31] this now if that body was already
[16:34] eternal then he couldn't die for you
[16:36] that so it had to not be turned around
[16:38] so he could die for you that's why we
[16:41] said that's why program said he died as
[16:42] a man of man right
[16:44] right here this that's right this right
[16:47] here he died as a man right but in this
[16:49] and that when that anointing on the
[16:52] river Jordan came on and made clicking
[16:53] that person so much that this couldn't
[16:56] even die that anointing was only made
[16:58] quicken so much that he could walk
[17:01] through a crowd of people and they did
[17:03] not even know he was there because
[17:05] they've tried to kill him it's time to
[17:06] die had not come there in the Garden of
[17:09] Gethsemane the spirit left him and it
[17:11] was time to die
[17:13] it was time and he began to cry out not
[17:14] walk not my will but thine be done and
[17:17] all of those kind of things but there
[17:18] even on the cross but around I have some
[17:21] folks in here he said that was Joe the
[17:23] died on the cross not that it was
[17:25] somebody else on the cross and I stress
[17:28] all this because if you want to know who
[17:30] the corner weed is today you gotta know
[17:32] who the corner of wheat was then it was
[17:34] Christ dwelling in flesh it was God
[17:37] dwelling in flesh what will it be today
[17:39] God tabernacling himself in flesh for
[17:48] saying this this is where we get so you
[17:55] know if when you're preaching you're
[17:56] preaching to the soul to be quickened
[17:58] dead right but so many look to the
[18:00] spirit then won't the spirit to be
[18:02] excited they won't the spirit to be
[18:04] quicken and everything I say the
[18:09] ministers and listen to what people say
[18:11] cuz you know catch up on what what the
[18:14] environment what people are some
[18:16] people's minds and that that's this some
[18:18] people's mind of today you come back
[18:20] from meetings I'll say I didn't come
[18:22] back for meetings and people begin to
[18:23] say well why our church Oh excited like
[18:26] that where people begin to say and you
[18:28] know you go to special meetings and
[18:30] everybody wants to get all excited and
[18:32] everything and and and shout and holler
[18:34] and that's that's what this this
[18:35] atmosphere of the place is you should be
[18:38] willing to jump and and and and shout
[18:41] and get excited but now now when when
[18:44] you hear the word and the when you get a
[18:48] revelation of the word that he has to
[18:50] from your sins they sanctifying your
[18:53] life that's something to get excited now
[18:56] that's this that's right this so they
[19:00] let it sink down into the soul with you
[19:02] next time about this that's why that's
[19:04] why Paul said bodily exercise profiteth
[19:05] little I'm always quoting this to my
[19:08] kids because even those anglers ways and
[19:09] stuff but that's not what Paul minutes
[19:12] alright that's not what Paul me that
[19:14] bottle the exercise probably a little
[19:15] it's alright to you know walk and
[19:19] exercise it's tough I that's good that's
[19:20] good for your body
[19:21] but it is it's good to and wonderful to
[19:25] jump around and stuff but let's get
[19:28] though get that anointing down onto the
[19:30] word you got to have the spirit and the
[19:32] truth anymore so not just a spirit not
[19:36] just an anointing on your body because
[19:38] on your spirit cuz you know down and
[19:40] down and that Louisiana camp that was
[19:42] warned if I had a wonderful time
[19:43] wonderful praise the Lord shout in the
[19:46] parking lot
[19:46] but you can have that same experience
[19:49] and no word no no word at all or false
[19:54] teaching and it won't quicken it that's
[19:56] right there's nothing too quick that's
[20:01] that's that's such a treacherous thing
[20:14] treacherous treacherous treacherous yes
[20:17] you've got to have the word spirit is
[20:20] wonderful to have but you gotta have the
[20:22] word first to eat the word and then let
[20:25] the spirit yes I feel like I'd stay on
[20:30] that for another 30 minutes and it
[20:31] wouldn't be a mom remember in the flesh
[20:37] he was just a man but his spirit he was
[20:39] God but a man in flesh there was before
[20:41] his body was a human being that was
[20:43] subject to temptations subject to
[20:45] sicknesses in just the same as iron yeah
[20:48] Jesus had perfect faith there's talking
[20:51] about the spirit with his food we'll all
[20:52] open up so that that word could operate
[20:55] completely through him and that's
[20:57] important to understand because that's
[20:58] what he's trying to get you to heaven
[21:00] he's trying to get you to a perfect man
[21:02] he's doing that we plan up just the same
[21:04] way as he does the individual right so
[21:07] that the word could float me free and
[21:10] can operate he quickens your life to
[21:15] this age jump over died that was Jehovah
[21:23] there and now recognizing the corner
[21:27] week of this seat back then even the
[21:31] ones that hurt John the Baptist came
[21:34] preaching different ones came preaching
[21:36] and so many failed to recognize that
[21:39] corner week I realized who it was
[21:40] standing there so we look at this this
[21:43] is when John the Baptist was staying on
[21:45] the River Jordan and he began he was
[21:47] speaking and his message was there's one
[21:49] comin who's latches that latching up his
[21:52] shoes I'm not even worthy to unleash his
[21:54] message was there's one coming after me
[21:56] he was going to baptize and so this is
[21:59] what he says and then two disciples
[22:00] heard him speak down there at verse 37
[22:02] and they followed Jesus now that's what
[22:06] we're supposed to be doing in this last
[22:07] day when this day I lied to ministry
[22:10] like John the Baptist did introduced
[22:12] that corn of wheat and we're supposed to
[22:14] go follow Jesus but yet so many are
[22:16] standing with all the the economy around
[22:21] the Prophet I recognize that John the
[22:23] Baptist came I recognized that Elijah
[22:25] came for our day and so they said we
[22:28] have found the Messiah which is being
[22:29] interpreted the Christ the Anointed were
[22:31] they found it now see it's so easy in
[22:35] this day to fail to recognize the
[22:38] anointed christ and where is he
[22:41] tabernacle
[22:42] the messenger came and preached his
[22:44] message there's a people that heard the
[22:46] message and they believed it and they
[22:48] received it and that word that message
[22:50] has been preached as being made manifest
[22:52] in the flesh of the people that received
[22:54] and so then where where is that
[22:57] manifested Christ
[22:58] now that message has been preached and
[23:01] this in is Tabernacle in the people at
[23:03] earlier message so if you're still back
[23:06] looking at something that we believe
[23:10] that brother bro we believe God sent a
[23:11] project so you must understand what he
[23:14] preached and that goes back to hear that
[23:17] hear the word and then the spirit can
[23:20] quickly and you see now you listen to
[23:24] different ones preaching up it's about
[23:26] to where it gets flip-flop now they're
[23:28] saying that if you if you do believe
[23:31] that the message is in the bride and
[23:34] that there's a five falton full ministry
[23:36] that's called to preach that that makes
[23:38] you an anointed one because you have
[23:40] left the listening of the tapes and the
[23:43] streaming of the tape and that's
[23:44] flip-flop back I wish y'all listen yeah
[23:47] listen to us
[23:49] listen to what's being said and pay
[23:51] attention cuz you know you can you can
[23:53] quote the letter of the message and the
[23:55] letter make a change sack like what
[23:57] brother Branham saying but there's a
[23:59] spirit behind it in essence and when you
[24:02] listen and you hear that their essence
[24:03] in wrong that makes the whole thing
[24:05] wrong yeah that's you know sometimes you
[24:09] could think about when when the when the
[24:11] early apostles laid out the framework of
[24:14] the New Testament and about how we're
[24:17] justified by faith alone and then here
[24:19] comes James and throws a little a little
[24:22] cog in the wheel so to speak and he says
[24:23] you're justified by works and not by
[24:25] faith alone my goodness
[24:28] see it takes the Holy Spirit that spirit
[24:30] is what gives understanding there's a
[24:33] spirit behind it that quickens the word
[24:35] so you can put everything together you
[24:38] kind of have that spirit and there's a
[24:40] spirit behind false doctrine that I'm
[24:42] spirit behind any through doctrine and
[24:44] that's really what you're listening for
[24:46] when you listen to preachers is not so
[24:48] much the exact words that they're using
[24:50] but the essence of
[24:52] they're trying to communicate are they
[24:53] trying to block up the flus are they
[24:55] trying to open them up yeah so listen
[24:57] when you listen to preaching you know
[24:59] you get I I really think so many thought
[25:04] getting so caught up in that spirit part
[25:06] they're listening to preachers based on
[25:09] how they tickle their fancy right how
[25:11] they tickle their emotions and
[25:12] everything and throwing out the word
[25:14] that's why people leave churches it's
[25:16] not because of the word is because of
[25:18] whether they like the guitar played or
[25:19] not yeah that's because of the emotional
[25:22] part of it yeah and not so much because
[25:25] of the word I I'm serious we could hit
[25:30] on that all day long and I don't think
[25:32] it'd be enough yeah you don't realize
[25:34] that in this last day that the shuk is
[25:36] gonna be so close to the seed until only
[25:39] the elect will be able to tell the other
[25:41] because the show is gonna still be stuck
[25:43] on emotion and and back in bygone days
[25:47] and things like that God sent prophet I
[25:49] don't know what he preached but God said
[25:52] the Prophet and just looking for some
[25:56] somebody to preach real good so they can
[25:58] say well I felt some they preached real
[26:00] fast or they preached through a bit you
[26:02] know that's right look here's another
[26:11] one there that did not recognize found
[26:15] it immediately to recognize the corn of
[26:17] wheat for his day was a polyps were they
[26:19] equivalent Priscilla came and expanded
[26:21] again to the way of truth because he was
[26:24] looking at the baptism of John he was
[26:26] still fixated on God sent a prophet but
[26:29] what was the prophets message there's
[26:32] gonna be somebody somebody coming that's
[26:34] gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost in
[26:35] fire and after he heard it he mildly
[26:38] convinced the Jews and that publicly
[26:40] showing by the scriptures that Jesus was
[26:41] Christ yes and then again at the little
[26:47] Ephesian Church we have not so heard so
[26:49] much as heard and
[26:50] they're beating us because they all they
[26:52] knew about was John's baptism they were
[26:54] still fixated on that God sent a prophet
[26:57] and not realizing that he had a message
[27:00] and that message was as he introduced
[27:03] Jesus Christ not just you know we it's
[27:07] wonderful that God sent a prophet but we
[27:09] there's something beyond that and what I
[27:12] mean is that I don't mean that like so
[27:15] many interpret that whether the fivefold
[27:16] ministry is gonna tell us something that
[27:17] the Prophet didn't know come on now God
[27:21] sent a prophet and there's gonna be some
[27:23] people that grab a hold of that make me
[27:25] and believe it and receive it and can
[27:27] share it with us and when they heard
[27:31] this they were baptized in the name of
[27:33] the Lord Jesus because as soon as you
[27:35] see everything right you gonna run
[27:37] straight to the water does the word when
[27:40] the word opens up to you and you
[27:41] realized through that corner we do yes
[27:42] yeah anointing is a person that's it and
[27:51] if Christ means The Anointed One and
[27:53] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:54] forever and he's the word and the word
[27:56] is the anointing it's the Word of God
[27:58] the anointed word that's what does it
[28:00] the word here I don't believe he's
[28:03] saying just a letter on the page but the
[28:05] word they anointed works has come off
[28:07] the page that's living inside you if
[28:09] that is the the anointed word that's
[28:12] going to fulfill what the letter LePage
[28:13] says y'all don't get too tired now
[28:19] sometimes I feel like even even
[28:21] ministries you know you have to kind of
[28:22] almost yell and scream in horror a
[28:24] little bit to tickle people's face thank
[28:26] you everybody wake up when the word you
[28:28] know the word should be enough really
[28:30] you know we were listening coming up the
[28:32] road I think it was Christ a mystery God
[28:34] revealed we're program was speaking all
[28:36] the same kind of thing that I looked at
[28:38] the little timer on the recording house
[28:39] well is that a 4-hour message and people
[28:43] sitting through for our messages back
[28:44] then we can't hardly sit through 30
[28:46] minutes here
[28:47] today because I feel like that the word
[28:49] is it's become so commonplace almost
[28:53] that we don't we don't see really see
[28:55] the value move it's just like the
[28:56] children of visual they call that that
[28:57] manner what is it because they didn't
[28:59] realize how valuable it was you think
[29:02] about when you get over on the other
[29:03] side and we're celebrating and praising
[29:06] God for eternity and we're living
[29:08] forever with you all of this is gonna
[29:10] it's gonna be worth it yeah it will
[29:18] produce in your life just like it did in
[29:20] their life
[29:21] I believe that same holy spirit you can
[29:23] rely upon and it will produce in your
[29:25] life just like it did in their life if
[29:29] we could find a way to unleash that
[29:31] power there's power the power of
[29:33] transformation very real power in this
[29:35] word let me skip through these he had it
[29:42] and it become because he was the word
[29:44] Jesus had perfect faith that's that what
[29:46] I really her that he had perfect faith
[29:47] he was he through and through from the
[29:50] souls of the Spirit and that's what God
[29:52] is doing us to us today by making us at
[29:55] Briah tree and that's really one of the
[29:57] one of them I think one of the paramount
[29:59] things for us to see in the message is
[30:02] how God grows us from a little seed up
[30:06] into like a mustard seed into a great
[30:08] big tree that's planted by the rivers of
[30:11] water that it's not tossed about by
[30:12] every wind of doctrine about everything
[30:14] that comes along but we know where we
[30:16] stand and we're drinking from that
[30:18] fountain of everlasting life and we're
[30:20] pulling it in and and and that's what
[30:23] the whole the whole scripture all the
[30:25] way through testifies up like this
[30:28] little chart I made of the of the seven
[30:30] feast days that this is just the first
[30:32] few feast days where Jesus Christ was
[30:35] planted and rose on the eighth day the
[30:37] Feast of the firstfruits and then you
[30:39] know you you take that that barley and
[30:41] you wave it to show that he rose from
[30:43] the dead and then fifty days later on
[30:46] the eighth day the church rises and the
[30:50] the two waves of
[30:53] two to ten deals that you wait to show
[30:55] that the church has risen and it is all
[30:58] testifying of God taking that seed
[31:00] taking this the word planning it and
[31:02] it's growing up into a great tree or
[31:06] there are so many different things that
[31:08] are different kind of plants in the
[31:10] Bible a tree a wheat plant all there are
[31:13] things that to show this same simple
[31:15] message and the message is simple it's
[31:18] not complicated it's as simple as plant
[31:19] something that's going to grow and and
[31:22] then you you get to harvest what you
[31:24] planted ever all down to the seven
[31:28] churches so we know how that in the in
[31:31] the first church age the the original
[31:33] word was was playing risen on the day of
[31:36] Pentecost then I'm through the seven
[31:42] Church agents you got button this is
[31:44] from another trumpet so you know really
[31:50] if you look at this you can't quite
[31:52] visualize it's difficult to visualize
[31:54] this time the space that's what the word
[31:56] was because this piece should be
[31:58] scrunched together but this was fifteen
[32:01] hundred years right now so right after
[32:03] the night scene council when Constantine
[32:05] came out and begin to sow his false
[32:07] doctrine and people got swayed away by
[32:09] those schemes that I was talking about
[32:11] the getting of this lesson they saw all
[32:13] of the supernatural things that were
[32:15] supposedly done in Constantine's life
[32:16] they saw the free farmland and all the
[32:19] things that he offered people to be able
[32:21] to to come into his way of thinking and
[32:24] they got off the word and the word began
[32:27] to be eaten down but yet there was these
[32:29] ministers Columba ministered right after
[32:32] that he was the nephew of Martin all
[32:34] these ministers that Bremer said Martin
[32:36] was the greatest census Christ that did
[32:39] not go off into that denominational
[32:42] system they stayed away from Rome mr.
[32:44] Caze and messengers that stayed with the
[32:46] true word and preached it but the people
[32:48] got in their heads that that that it is
[32:51] fine just to get an emotion or it's fine
[32:53] just to get free farmland or it's fine
[32:54] just to all band together and be one and
[32:57] so the word began to be eaten
[32:59] the word the spirit was still there down
[33:01] through the seven church age is
[33:02] manifesting the life of whatever word
[33:05] whatever a little bit of word could be
[33:07] could be manifest that was still there
[33:09] that the people would believe but the
[33:11] word was eaten down all the way down to
[33:13] the roof just about all the way down and
[33:16] then he began to restore it back through
[33:19] the revelation of Martin Luther's
[33:22] revelation of the new version you know
[33:25] I'm just going all over the place right
[33:27] now but Martin Luther's revelation of
[33:30] the new birth was not was justification
[33:32] it was when you get the new birth that
[33:35] God has justified you man it was not so
[33:37] much that of the first step on the way
[33:39] to get the new birth was justification
[33:41] but his revelation was you get just a
[33:44] found sanctified filled with all ghosts
[33:45] and then you were justified right yeah
[33:47] John Wesley's revelation of the new
[33:50] birth was over there and I think it's
[33:52] first Thessalonians 5:23 if I remember
[33:56] right that God will entirely sanctify
[33:58] you he's looking at the new birth as guy
[34:00] sanctifying work of God performing
[34:03] molding you into his image and you know
[34:06] we get it on our heads that he didn't
[34:07] have the new birth he only had a
[34:09] revelation of the progress on into the
[34:11] new birth of sanctification but that was
[34:13] his revelation about the new birth would
[34:15] and then own into a higher a higher
[34:18] revelation of what the new birth was on
[34:20] the day of Pentecost where the holy
[34:21] ghost himself came and restored the
[34:23] gifts but then we're coming on up into
[34:26] the Eagle age with a message a message
[34:28] of redemption to change it to bring us
[34:31] back like a chart of soul spirit and
[34:34] body that God is bringing us back to
[34:37] full redemption you know where he could
[34:39] take us just how back to how Jesus was
[34:42] after he rose from the dead and his body
[34:45] was glorified it was changed that's
[34:47] where God's taking us back to him to a
[34:49] changed body and the way he does that is
[34:52] through the opening of the word that's
[34:53] why that's why you needed this capstone
[34:55] to come down this capstone message
[34:57] to take us to take us from time to get
[35:01] all because you ain't going to eternity
[35:03] from straight into eternity without a
[35:05] perfect missing
[35:07] now one word off if it was one word off
[35:10] in the beginning that kept Adam and Eve
[35:12] balance shackled to the earth it's going
[35:15] to be I have to be a perfect message of
[35:17] redemption to take us from the ballers
[35:19] of earth into eternity that's that's
[35:22] what this capstone message is this eagle
[35:24] and you can see how we come down through
[35:25] a white horse rider help God it's the
[35:28] scent of a combatant it gets that spirit
[35:31] on an ox Amanda Eagle all of these and
[35:33] the spirit the spirit working in the
[35:36] people through each of these each of
[35:38] these seven churches to manifest that
[35:41] spirit for their age to combat what the
[35:43] devil is doing but now in this age that
[35:47] spirit of the Eagle is a pulling the
[35:49] bride to it to soar higher up than all
[35:51] of the all of the others could ever be
[35:53] able to see and we have to give us a
[35:55] perfect revelation to escape to escape
[35:58] the bonds of tunnel yeah and that's what
[36:00] brother Ram said was called the second
[36:02] seat and the super sign he said the
[36:04] first he called a Christ his second seat
[36:06] look at his new Christ and his bride and
[36:10] the super son he said Christ is the
[36:13] supercede the second seed was Christ and
[36:15] we are born by Christ which makes us the
[36:17] super seat with Christ to God now we are
[36:20] the super seed not an organization now
[36:23] or denomination as a super seat that
[36:26] that that pattern of the two seats set
[36:29] up in Ephesus that first seed was
[36:32] planted Christ and in this day the
[36:35] second seed is being matured that while
[36:37] God brings us right back around to a
[36:40] mature seed again and that parallels
[36:42] that vision that brother had of the two
[36:44] like the two brides and that's what we
[36:47] called the second seat when he saw that
[36:48] vision of the bride being paraded before
[36:51] him twice first the original bride came
[36:54] forth from it from Ephesus not like
[36:56] there's two brides but this is the
[36:58] original an adult rated word of that
[37:01] goes first
[37:02] those first believers that were there
[37:04] the little small group of Ephesians the
[37:05] little small group of believers that in
[37:08] the word was eaten down and now on this
[37:10] day that second seed that second bride
[37:13] was being paraded before
[37:15] I was thinking about all the nonsense
[37:21] I've heard recently about that that
[37:23] vision I can't stay on track yes this is
[37:29] what the bride seed is that the original
[37:31] seed was planted here and the second
[37:34] seed here that he's bringing us up
[37:36] through the through Wheatland that
[37:38] growing us up until we see when you are
[37:40] mature Christian you say in the same
[37:43] thing and so we throw that around their
[37:46] legs not gonna be deceived this is what
[37:48] we mean now if you're down here you can
[37:51] still be deceived you're down here but
[37:53] when you're an adopted son of God and
[37:56] God you the full word of God is being
[37:59] made manifest in you and not just like
[38:01] the fullness of the Godhead Bobby y'all
[38:02] know what I mean but the the word of God
[38:06] for your day is made manifest in your
[38:08] members then you're at a place where
[38:11] you're not gonna be swayed by all the
[38:13] nonsense this bantered about you're not
[38:15] gonna be swayed by somebody saying the
[38:17] through evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[38:18] just a feeling or an emotion and you're
[38:20] gonna know what the what the Prophet is
[38:22] saying yeah you're gonna know the Daniel
[38:25] 70 weeks us really talking about
[38:26] Redemption you know you're gonna have a
[38:28] revelation of what those things are you
[38:30] gonna see when the seven seals are
[38:31] because you see His redemptive work in
[38:34] your life in your own life how God has
[38:36] taken you from the thinnest world and
[38:39] make his life manifest in you cuz it's
[38:46] not just letters on a page but it's a
[38:48] story of what is God has done for you
[38:51] and I think so many have made it just
[38:54] like a book of rules and all of all kind
[38:57] of different things but it's a
[38:58] redemptive story God's love and grace
[39:01] for you yes we still have some time
[39:09] I'm will slide 50 of 83 yeah the bride
[39:18] this is the Builder I was talking about
[39:19] that vision that he talked about in the
[39:21] brian tree said the bride coming to you
[39:23] twice the first seat and the second seat
[39:26] both of them exactly the same one Emma
[39:29] the first seed and the second seed the
[39:34] second seed is just like the first seed
[39:38] because that's that that's that we plant
[39:40] story see how simple that is
[39:42] that's so simple the first seed is
[39:44] planted it grows up through the wheat
[39:46] plant although we planet has debride if
[39:48] you've received the word for your day
[39:50] but then in this day and this time you
[39:54] receive the word for your day and that
[39:56] makes you part of that brings you back
[39:58] to the original that second seed measure
[40:01] Mason see he say that as they marked
[40:03] perfectly in line with the word Emet
[40:06] perfectly in line
[40:08] not one word off that's right that's
[40:10] kind of a bold statement in not one word
[40:13] off and you know will almost make it a
[40:16] doctrinal thing where we just bash each
[40:18] other over the hypnotist about you don't
[40:20] believe without believing that but
[40:21] that's not what that means it's the word
[40:23] bringing us into the the revelation of
[40:26] what of his Redemption for us and and
[40:29] that's what's gonna bring us into
[40:31] oneness that they were all scared and
[40:34] everything on the Pentagon the day of
[40:35] Pentecost but when the spirit fell and
[40:37] quicken that they were all in one Accord
[40:38] the unit right when the spirit quicken
[40:40] them and gave them a true understanding
[40:42] of the word for their day then there
[40:44] what no differences they were all in one
[40:46] Accord
[40:49] and see to go back to the River Jordan
[40:52] where there's a man in with a soul God
[40:56] the spirit of God but in his body he was
[41:00] flesh and after the spirit fell on him
[41:03] to quicken that word to send him in his
[41:04] ministry
[41:05] then Satan began to test him and it says
[41:08] this then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[41:12] of the Spirit
[41:13] like a little and because the sons of
[41:15] God are led by the Spirit of God that's
[41:18] that's what we need the spirit we need
[41:19] the anointing in our lives we need the
[41:21] Spirit of God in us to lead us to the
[41:24] word to a good job that will take up all
[41:27] of our time that will allow us to
[41:29] studying things that I took to a good
[41:32] spouse or whatever to to lead us in the
[41:36] correct way to raise up our children and
[41:38] without the leading of the Spirit and
[41:41] you know if you think you don't leave
[41:42] the spirit then you you're like somebody
[41:45] that says why I can do it on my own we
[41:48] can't do it on my own friends we need
[41:51] God we need the Holy Spirit is in his
[41:53] church we need one another because God
[41:55] are working in each other and ever
[41:57] handle I'm running out of time back up
[42:00] give me one one more minute
[42:03] and this is this is how same test you
[42:05] and I preached on this a few Sundays
[42:07] that there is but the same way that the
[42:11] devil tested Jesus not the same way he
[42:14] tested test you right and this is what I
[42:16] was talking about what Constantine
[42:18] putting the devil through Constantine
[42:20] put all these things in front of the
[42:22] people if thou be the Son of God to get
[42:25] him off the word to get them focused on
[42:28] supernatural things to get them focused
[42:31] on their position something that that
[42:34] the church or somebody can do for them
[42:36] and it gets them off the word and they
[42:38] get off the off the correct focus I'm
[42:43] not gonna have time for this so we're
[42:45] gonna have you go ahead and stop right
[42:46] now and we'll do this some other time
