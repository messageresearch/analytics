[5:33] amen and we're hearing that word hearing
[5:36] what lies ahead hearing what's going on
[5:38] right now amen I really enjoyed that
[5:41] message this morning amen I am the
[5:43] resurrection and the life I am amen not
[5:47] looking for a future tense but I am by
[5:49] the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[5:51] we got so much to be thankful for my
[5:53] brothers and sisters so much to thank
[5:55] the Lord for this word that comes from
[5:56] this Pulpit it's such a such a blessing
[5:59] am amen and it's not something to take
[6:00] for granted amen it's it's it's
[6:03] certainly something that we just got to
[6:05] continue to keep thirsty keep pressing
[6:07] forward in just praying yesterday
[6:09] morning just pressing in you know many
[6:12] times we got many distractions raising a
[6:13] family so many respons abilities but oh
[6:17] God we have to press our way press past
[6:20] all those things to get into the
[6:21] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[6:24] he can speak to us and we certainly need
[6:26] it certainly continue to remember all
[6:27] the young people that at Camp many of
[6:29] them and we watched some of it last
[6:31] night and some of them are going to be
[6:33] different by the grace of the Lord amen
[6:34] cuz there certainly an atmosphere that
[6:36] they create out there and the young
[6:38] people that need it they need it they
[6:40] need something to grab a hold to to know
[6:43] that it's real and I tell my kids once
[6:46] God gets a hold of you it's over amen I
[6:49] was 21 years old when God just got a
[6:51] hold of my life in the midst of all the
[6:53] promises that the world could offer
[6:55] something dropped down that was greater
[6:57] than all of that amen and it changed a
[6:59] whole course of everything that I am by
[7:02] his grace so I know it's real and just
[7:04] keep the young people in prayer it's a
[7:06] hard time I mean with everything that
[7:08] they got to face it's it's going to take
[7:10] the grace of God but thank God for that

[10:13] but anyhow just remember them our
[10:16] heavenly father we thank you for thy
[10:18] Grace and your love thank you for the
[10:20] day that we have because Lord knowing
[10:23] and realizing that you are God and you
[10:26] change not Lord that we can do depend
[10:29] upon that and put our whole hearts and
[10:32] lives and dwell upon everything put it
[10:34] all on you have your way be with each
[10:37] one remember the sick among us thank you
[10:39] for touching some of these here Lord
[10:42] especially for the the ones that are
[10:45] Lord on up in age and all and we know
[10:47] that time has taking its toll upon these
[10:50] old bodies but that don't have nothing
[10:51] to do with the healing virtues of
[10:53] Calvary we love you and we thank you and
[10:56] we commit it all to you now have your
[10:58] way bless the sick among us you said you
[11:01] sent your word and healed us and
[11:04] delivered us from destruction we believe
[11:06] that father we thank you for it in Jesus
[11:10] name
[11:13] amen Revelations
[11:16] 21 I hope we can finish up today of what
[11:20] I want to try to bring on this and
[11:22] continue on then all
[11:25] right Revelation
[11:27] 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[11:30] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[11:33] Earth were passed away and there was no
[11:36] more sea now remember the future home is
[11:40] coming down over to around there in
[11:43] Israel so to me now that's what the
[11:46] emphasis is made and there's no more sea
[11:49] it's not doing away with water it's not
[11:51] doing away with all things but if you
[11:54] bring the city down over there there
[11:57] would be no sea cuz that's where a lot
[11:59] of your seas are Sea of Galilee sea of
[12:02] this sea of that is right in the
[12:03] Jerusalem area so I think it's just
[12:06] emphasizing uh no more sea because it'd
[12:09] be you know taken up in land of the city
[12:12] 1500 square mile city be a big old place
[12:16] all right and I John saw the holy city
[12:18] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[12:20] of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for
[12:23] her husband and heard a great voice out
[12:25] of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle
[12:28] of God is with men
[12:29] and he will dwell with them and they
[12:31] shall be his people and God himself
[12:33] shall be with them and be their God and
[12:36] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[12:38] eyes and there shall be no more sorrow
[12:42] No More Death no more neither sorrow nor
[12:45] crying neither shall there be any more
[12:47] pain for the former things are passed
[12:49] away and he that sat upon the throne
[12:52] said behold I make all things new and he
[12:55] said unto me right for these words are
[12:59] true and faithful all right stop in
[13:02] there then we'll go over to
[13:05] Matthew
[13:08] 5
[13:12] 13 and he's coming through the the the
[13:14] Beatitudes and uh Sermon on the Mount
[13:17] you know and uh I I like the Beatitudes
[13:20] is one thing the Beatitudes is what we
[13:23] ought to
[13:24] be what we're supposed to be beatitude
[13:28] be your attitude you know uh what we
[13:31] ought to be and what we're supposed to
[13:33] be right you are the salt of the earth
[13:36] but it's a salt have lost its savior
[13:38] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[13:41] henceforth good for nothing but to be
[13:44] cast out and to be Tren to
[13:46] underfoot of men you are the light of
[13:50] the world a city that is set on a hill
[13:53] cannot be hid neither do men light a
[13:56] candle and put it under a bushel
[13:59] but on a Candlestick and it giveth light
[14:02] unto all that are in the house let your
[14:04] light so shine before men that they may
[14:07] see your good works and glorify your
[14:11] father which is in heaven amen you may
[14:14] be seated Lord at his Blessing to the
[14:16] reading of the
[14:22] word which when I always say that I'll
[14:25] drop off on something I generally have
[14:27] about five sermons left over but any
[14:29] anyhow we uh we try our best to finish
[14:32] up today I hope you enjoyed this
[14:34] morning's message to me it was uh to
[14:39] what I've been thinking on because see I
[14:41] believe in a positive attitude that's
[14:45] that's the main thing you know
[14:47] negativism gets you nowhere you call me
[14:49] on the phone I'm uh I'll I'll emphasize
[14:52] this one time I remember uh after we'd
[14:56] come out of the Baptist Church and and I
[14:58] had got real sick with a cold or
[15:00] something and and uh one of my former uh
[15:04] friends there with us in the church he
[15:07] came to see me and uh we talked and
[15:10] talked a while and after a while he said
[15:14] I come to see you thinking you're sick
[15:17] he said you're not sick I said well
[15:19] that's that's good so you know yourself
[15:22] you call me on the phone if I'm laying
[15:23] in the bed or where I'm laying how are
[15:25] you doing I'm doing great why because
[15:29] there's no need of being
[15:31] negative oh I'm just having all of this
[15:34] wowy brother fory says it wowy wowy woo
[15:37] you know man I'm just down and out and
[15:40] and all you know everything uh that that
[15:45] won't get you anywhere negativism is
[15:47] just a bad thing uh you know but
[15:51] positive uh you know uh you you go to
[15:54] the doctor I do and if he if he's
[15:57] positive I'm positive but if he's
[15:59] negative I'm
[16:02] gone just the best way to say it if he's
[16:05] negative I'm gone cuz I don't have to I
[16:07] don't have no need of nobody else you
[16:10] know I mean you get to be 78 79 years
[16:13] old you uh you got enough problems You
[16:15] Don't Need No Doctor to tell you how
[16:17] wrong or how bad you are you need
[16:21] somebody to try to encourage you on do
[16:24] it and I believe in a positive attitude
[16:26] I believe in a positive attitude about
[16:28] the word of God I believe in reading the
[16:31] word of
[16:33] God to not to try to figure out what
[16:36] it's
[16:37] saying you said well I like to know what
[16:39] it's saying don't worry about it it's
[16:42] saying it just read it so you try to
[16:44] figure out what it's saying you get lost
[16:47] in the whole terminologies and you'll
[16:49] try to make this say something you come
[16:52] up with something that is of no good to
[16:54] you no value but to read it as to what
[16:57] it says
[16:59] you know and and all and that uh you
[17:02] know what amazes me is that you get
[17:06] people that read the Bible and they
[17:07] can't tell you what the Bible's talking
[17:09] about cuz they're trying to find
[17:11] something like that but give them a
[17:14] newspaper give them a newspaper and
[17:16] about two days later ask them what's in
[17:17] the newspaper they'll tell you
[17:19] everything to the
[17:21] detail you know all about it see and I I
[17:25] just I'm I'm that point I believe in
[17:28] just saying what the word says and then
[17:31] just forget it because it it ain't going
[17:34] to help us none to be negative but it
[17:37] will help us to be positive all right
[17:39] now as I saying this morning the Lord
[17:41] Jesus said when he brought forth he said
[17:44] I am the resurrection and the
[17:47] life now I tried to emphasize the point
[17:52] because I knew this was tied together
[17:53] with these two messages in that uh I
[17:57] told you this morning we try to go in to
[17:59] the to that but we didn't get there so
[18:01] we just stop off but we'll pick up this
[18:04] afternoon to try to tie together our
[18:06] thoughts all right now what was we
[18:09] talking about this morning just as a
[18:12] second
[18:14] Martha was great in her understanding
[18:17] she had a good
[18:19] confession but her confession was
[18:22] always not positive in looking at what
[18:27] who she was talking to
[18:29] she was saying if you hadn't been
[18:34] here see then she said even though
[18:39] you're here now but if whatever you ask
[18:44] him he's going to give you she had a
[18:47] good confession that sound good but just
[18:50] remember that wasn't what he said why
[18:52] would he turn right straight to her and
[18:54] all of that point or she confessing all
[18:57] of her if you think it's so good and say
[18:59] I am the
[19:01] resurrection see to me he was declaring
[19:04] that he was the god of the
[19:06] word and that the god of the word was
[19:09] the
[19:11] resurrection all right he was declaring
[19:13] a positive statement of who he was the
[19:17] one that met Moses from the burning
[19:21] bush that said I am that I am stands
[19:25] here now to say I am the resurrection
[19:28] who's the resurrection I
[19:31] am all right see it wasn't looking for a
[19:34] god somewhere else or a thought or
[19:37] something else that Martha was looking
[19:39] for if you had been your if you know if
[19:41] you asked God now he'll give it to you
[19:44] he was saying
[19:46] MAA I'm the god of the
[19:49] word see th stood the resurrection
[19:53] Resurrection is not a a Doctrine or an
[19:56] idea or a thought
[19:58] it's a person
[20:01] right it's a person the son of man is
[20:04] the resurrection
[20:06] sign all
[20:09] right the son of man is the Resurrection
[20:12] The Lord Jesus had the resurrection sign
[20:15] cuz he was the resurrection all right
[20:19] and I told you all the way down through
[20:20] time we didn't have a lot of things but
[20:22] when it come over to the end of it isn't
[20:25] it odd to Here Come the son of man right
[20:27] back into view
[20:30] brother brandom had the resurrection
[20:32] sign what bring me 24 of your worst
[20:35] cases and I'll guarantee you healing
[20:37] that was the resurrection
[20:39] sign the resurrection sign is never
[20:42] negative it's positive it's complete
[20:46] it's finished so we need to say what the
[20:49] word says about us all brother R said
[20:53] one day like this he said he had
[20:55] confidence in what God Said or in who
[20:58] God who he said that he was all right
[21:02] see
[21:04] then think about the
[21:07] word when he said I
[21:09] am the
[21:13] resurrection if that God lives in
[21:16] you no wonder your Prophet would say
[21:20] that your Resurrection lays inside of
[21:24] you
[21:26] right but like I said he said it lays
[21:29] inside of you and your spirit then he
[21:31] turn around and explain soul and what
[21:33] happens this that and we're still it's
[21:36] in my spirit it is not in your five
[21:42] senses those need the new
[21:45] birth it's in the spirit of
[21:48] God is where the resurrection
[21:51] lies all right because that's the word
[21:53] Made Alive all right get that hold on to
[21:56] that thought now then as we go along
[22:00] all right a positive attitude of who he
[22:04] was the prophet said when the bride
[22:07] realizes who she
[22:10] is and what she's here
[22:14] for all right that sounds pretty
[22:17] positive right that sounds like you know
[22:19] what you're
[22:21] doing even Satan cannot Prevail against
[22:26] that he just he don't understand it when
[22:29] when you're sick you're hurting like
[22:31] everything somebody ask I'm I'm
[22:35] wonderful thank god sister Johnny always
[22:38] says well I woke up this
[22:40] morning that's a good point you know I
[22:42] woke up this morning amen you know what
[22:45] a lot of people didn't wake
[22:47] up right so that's a positive attitude
[22:51] and having that about the whole thing we
[22:54] don't have to make ourselves
[22:57] [Music]
[22:59] we don't have to make ourselves
[23:02] something that's that's my whole has
[23:05] always been my emphasis it's not to try
[23:07] to make yourself
[23:09] something it's to be what God wants you
[23:11] to
[23:12] be don't worry about it he'll make
[23:17] you he'll bring you to the right
[23:20] place well brother d one of these days
[23:23] we're going to we're going to get this
[23:24] great Revelation one of these days we're
[23:27] going to do where's it coming
[23:32] from go on your internet and find
[23:35] out you got it on there now Plum full of
[23:39] what people thinking they found this
[23:41] great nugget they found this great thing
[23:45] we are against the the Brites we're
[23:47] against this that or the
[23:49] other they think they found some great
[23:52] thing to to destroy the message is what
[23:57] God wants now how can you do
[24:01] that I told you 50 almost 50 years ago
[24:05] that don't you worry about the the
[24:07] methodists and the Baptists and the
[24:08] Catholics and the Protestants and
[24:11] whatever it can't be there it's got to
[24:14] be right among our
[24:16] ranks because it's got to be where that
[24:19] that that party is all right now but see
[24:22] think about
[24:26] it he declared
[24:29] that he was the
[24:32] resurrection now he didn't declare it
[24:34] was coming or would be or maybe thought
[24:38] he declared that he was the
[24:42] resurrection and being that resurrection
[24:45] and the
[24:47] life all right now he declared that to
[24:50] be I want to get kind of backward to
[24:52] what I want to do so Brothers if you
[24:55] will uh go to number 11 because I've
[24:59] promised this it's in the message part
[25:03] but I promised it cuz I make statements
[25:06] and sometimes I don't declare brother
[25:07] randam as what he said so you wonder
[25:10] whether it's true or
[25:12] not but I want you to than about
[25:14] something when we get around to this in
[25:17] the end of
[25:19] it I'm a kind of a person that
[25:23] likes uh for things to be in an
[25:26] order you know
[25:29] and and line up in an order uh what you
[25:32] call it series of events or whatever so
[25:35] what I can understand and follow
[25:40] that I want it to be that I can see it
[25:43] and then I'm not
[25:46] confused like I've always said to you
[25:48] you think it's crazy but if you'll
[25:50] listen you'll hear a lot of these
[25:52] statements that I make where people
[25:54] would say you know make statements about
[25:57] something and and it be so odd and
[26:00] brother random would say you know if I
[26:03] don't see you no more just as an
[26:05] example I'll see you in the
[26:09] Millennium next thing to happen is the
[26:13] Millennium he just said
[26:17] it I don't see you any more see you no
[26:20] he just said
[26:22] that as a lot takes place before the
[26:25] Millennium that's right
[26:28] see but we take our own thoughts or
[26:30] concept about what he's
[26:33] saying and then we wind up in bad shape
[26:36] so I found this years ago and it ties
[26:38] into the message that we're in and I
[26:41] wrote this down and I would advise you
[26:42] to write it down or mark it
[26:45] somewhere I got this one written in the
[26:47] front of my Bible because it's all for
[26:49] questions and answers book four 1964
[26:53] 8:30 evening he gives an order of
[26:57] events to to take
[26:59] place all
[27:01] right then let's let's stay with that
[27:03] part they asked him a question the
[27:06] church ages ending uh blacked out the
[27:10] brides call we've already entered into
[27:12] the tribulation period now that was
[27:14] their question look he says no no no I
[27:18] wish I could just have more time on that
[27:21] so now watch
[27:22] him now he's going to give a series of
[27:27] events he's going to explain why that
[27:30] it's not to the point that we've entered
[27:32] the tribulation period because at that
[27:35] time there was a lot of time before the
[27:36] tribulation period would have to take
[27:39] place so now look to his
[27:43] answer the bride when she's taken from
[27:46] the
[27:49] church then the church age will
[27:54] cease well when will the search a see
[27:57] when the bride is taken from the
[28:01] church well I think it ended over here
[28:04] it ended about 2 or three years ago
[28:06] because of the of this this
[28:10] that I don't care what you think you not
[28:13] care what I think he just explained
[28:15] something to you if You' listen that's
[28:17] what I'm
[28:18] saying Ride when she's taken from the
[28:23] church then the church age will
[28:26] cease lady goes into
[28:30] chaos the bride goes to glory and the
[28:34] tribulation period sets in upon the
[28:37] sleeping
[28:40] virgin now I ain't going to get into no
[28:43] Daniel 70 weeks with you but that is a
[28:45] valuable point that you've got a
[28:49] tribulation for the sleeping virin and
[28:51] you got a tribulation for
[28:54] Israel but that's all
[28:56] right so day if you request it I'll try
[28:59] to take back up again on maybe some of
[29:01] these things but I just preach what I
[29:04] preach and if it's 1980 when I preached
[29:08] it I don't believe in preaching it no
[29:09] more unless it's
[29:11] needed if you want to hear it all right
[29:13] if you don't want to hear it forget it
[29:16] that solves a problem with me look lady
[29:19] OA goes into chaos the bride into glory
[29:22] and the tribulation period sets in upon
[29:25] the sleeping virgin for three and five
[29:28] years while Israel is getting its
[29:30] prophecy I you then tribulation sets in
[29:34] upon
[29:37] Israel and then comes the battle of
[29:39] Armageddon 1 2 3
[29:44] 4 which destroys all things then the
[29:48] bride returns back with the groom for a
[29:51] thousand
[29:52] years Millennium
[29:55] right the millennial reign after that
[29:58] comes the white Throne
[30:01] judgment after that comes the new
[30:04] heavens and new
[30:06] earth you might think he's off about new
[30:09] Heavens Isaiah says
[30:12] Heavens John says Heaven and
[30:15] Earth read Isaiah 65 I think it it says
[30:20] Heavens comes the new heavens and new
[30:23] earth and the new city coming down from
[30:26] God out of heaven eternity and time
[30:29] Blends
[30:31] together now that's a series of
[30:35] events this happens that happens this
[30:38] happen that happened that's the way I
[30:40] like to look at
[30:42] things see then somebody come along and
[30:44] say like could say the statement well I
[30:47] don't see you no more I'll see you in
[30:48] the Millennium that wasn't what he
[30:50] said well I got to
[30:53] quote you got to quote but you quoted it
[30:56] because there's the ser events why don't
[30:58] you search out and let him answer it
[31:00] what comes after what the only one he
[31:03] left out of there is Gog and Magog Gog
[31:06] and Magog is the final battle right
[31:08] before the new heavens and new earth
[31:11] comes into being all right now but think
[31:15] about that and you just take that home
[31:17] with you because I want to I want to
[31:19] conclude something this afternoon if we
[31:22] can CU we've been talking for quite a
[31:25] while about the things to take place and
[31:30] how that it'll be one day that in the
[31:33] future
[31:35] home all right in the Millennium you
[31:38] have days nights and different things
[31:41] all right in the future home outside the
[31:44] city you can have days and nights and
[31:46] things but in the city you have no
[31:51] night all right you have no Temple you
[31:55] have a temple even built in the
[31:57] millennium
[31:58] but in the future home you have no
[32:00] Temple because the Bible says that the
[32:03] lamb is the
[32:05] temple you have no need of
[32:09] light because he is the
[32:12] light
[32:14] right now you said well well how will
[32:17] that be if there's no n no no light or
[32:21] nothing
[32:24] well let's just think about these things
[32:27] just for a minut minute with a thought
[32:28] in
[32:32] mind in the beginning God
[32:35] created the heavens and the
[32:38] earth now drop back into the message
[32:42] we'll run through today in a quick hurry
[32:44] so don't worry about getting bored we'll
[32:46] try to keep up in a
[32:48] hurry all in Genesis God created the
[32:51] heavens in the
[32:52] Earth all right we read that it was
[32:55] without form and void and darkness was
[32:59] upon all
[33:01] right then we've read there in Genesis 1
[33:04] where God created
[33:08] light okay you go down a few more that
[33:12] was day one you go down a few more
[33:14] verses and you'll find out that the sun
[33:17] and the moon was created on the fourth
[33:21] day all right so what was created when
[33:24] it said
[33:26] light light was created the first
[33:30] day let there be
[33:33] light was it
[33:37] dark did God exist in a
[33:46] Darkness well yeah I guess he did it was
[33:49] dark without
[33:51] no God never existed in darkness there's
[33:54] no such
[33:55] thing as I tried to illust straight
[33:58] strike one match in a in a closed up
[34:00] building it sets out the darkness of
[34:02] that
[34:03] building that's all it takes is one
[34:05] match and it stretch it out all
[34:08] right see so what was the first creation
[34:11] that would that he'd be dealing with is
[34:16] light
[34:19] okay God created
[34:22] light did he was it so dark to let just
[34:25] become Darkness then he cre creates
[34:28] light or is that just a terminology or a
[34:32] thought of an
[34:34] expression because where God is there is
[34:38] no Darkness
[34:40] right did he exist in a world or a
[34:43] thought or a concept of
[34:48] darkness no that's what we're reading
[34:52] but in reading that we're doing what I
[34:54] said we're reading trying to find some
[34:57] Secret thing instead of just reading it
[35:01] and letting it say what it's
[35:04] saying to me that's simply
[35:08] saying
[35:10] that God is to come into
[35:13] being to be comprehended by
[35:19] mankind he's going to bring himself into
[35:22] being to where he can be
[35:26] comprehended all right so it's not
[35:28] giving a Darkness as a
[35:31] Darkness it just simply trying to
[35:34] express a
[35:35] point to opposition of light so what was
[35:39] that first light but it was not the moon
[35:42] and the stars it was not the Sun and the
[35:45] Moon that was created on the fourth day
[35:48] read your
[35:53] Bible see what is that light then
[36:02] your Prophet says it like
[36:07] this the first thing go ahead with
[36:10] number one we'll just read a few of
[36:12] these and then we'll drop
[36:15] off from questions and answers on
[36:21] Genesis he was in other words Adam the
[36:24] first man in the lower creation of God
[36:27] the first creation was God
[36:32] himself then out of God came to logos
[36:35] which was a Son of God then out of the
[36:36] logos which were the word in the
[36:38] beginning was the
[36:40] word and now it comes the
[36:44] man now as I said we think we read that
[36:49] it says it was without form and void all
[36:53] right now then if you're going to go
[36:55] that cornal with reading your words of
[36:57] natural things then read that
[37:01] statement the first creation was God
[37:05] [Music]
[37:09] himself did God create
[37:13] [Music]
[37:16] himself well that's what it
[37:20] says what did he create himself from
[37:24] [Music]
[37:28] I'm trying to illustrate the point of
[37:30] looking at something and thinking we
[37:33] know what we're talking
[37:35] about and would read and it says it was
[37:38] without form and void and darkness was
[37:40] upon so we look at dog all that's just a
[37:43] simple point of illustration to connect
[37:46] your human mind to a
[37:49] point to show
[37:51] you because at that
[37:53] time God creates himself
[37:57] [Music]
[38:02] brother R said how could God create
[38:04] himself when he's the
[38:06] Creator remember that out of the church
[38:08] age
[38:09] book when he's the very Creator
[38:13] [Music]
[38:15] himself it's expressing
[38:18] something it's trying to explain
[38:22] something that is
[38:26] unexplainable right
[38:28] is trying to bring the human
[38:32] mind into a
[38:34] situation that we can start
[38:38] comprehending so why not say it like
[38:45] this the first
[38:48] creation was God as he begin to
[38:54] condescend not a creation of a creation
[38:56] that comes into great when he begins to
[38:59] condescend so we can
[39:03] [Music]
[39:04] understand now you're getting the
[39:07] light not the moon and the sun over on
[39:10] day four leave that out of
[39:15] it so you're coming to light in other
[39:19] words what are you coming
[39:20] to
[39:24] understanding God is opening up
[39:29] understanding of mankind and he writes
[39:32] in his
[39:35] Bible showing to the mankind how he's
[39:38] coming into
[39:40] being to reveal himself to the man
[39:46] amen go remember
[39:49] now according to my understanding Moses
[39:53] wrote
[39:55] this which that would have been a few
[39:58] hundred years after the maybe a couple
[40:01] of thousand after the original creation
[40:05] and what it was and
[40:07] Moses is told to write
[40:11] what
[40:14] this to try to help the mankind that had
[40:17] already lived 2 or 3,000
[40:20] years because isn't Moses don't he fall
[40:23] After the flood don't he fall after the
[40:25] first 2,000 and do it
[40:29] right and after all that said and done
[40:32] when he comes over and he says Moses
[40:36] now you just pick up a pen and start
[40:41] writing How could a Moses wrote and God
[40:48] was and God is going to now reveal
[40:54] himself he couldn't put that in
[40:56] terminologies
[40:58] words I'm trying to get your thought to
[41:00] line up on
[41:03] something then your Prophet comes
[41:07] along and he picks up what all of these
[41:11] have said about Moses and Israel and
[41:14] what does he
[41:16] say he said and the first thing God
[41:19] created was
[41:25] himself that's not
[41:27] him taking mud and building up in a pile
[41:31] and jumps into it and it
[41:33] becomes it took a long time to
[41:38] transmit about 4,000 years to transmit
[41:42] down to
[41:44] flesh right so let's don't get so big of
[41:46] a wang bang out of it and run off you
[41:50] understand what I
[41:51] mean it took God all of those years to
[41:54] be able to bring into
[41:55] being himself that we could understand
[42:00] him so the first thing he created was
[42:04] himself now
[42:06] look go to number
[42:08] [Music]
[42:13] two they talking about what connection
[42:15] ises Genesis 1 and 2 he says you no the
[42:20] connect it's it's explaining it watch
[42:22] him and if you notice come on up
[42:27] if you notice in
[42:29] creation the first thing that was
[42:31] created of course was
[42:36] light you come on down through the
[42:39] creation like thing created was a
[42:43] man now he says it's
[42:45] light this is out of the same
[42:52] book so now you got God's first creation
[42:56] is himself
[42:58] now you got his first creation is
[43:07] light that must be the same
[43:11] person or thought or concept however
[43:14] what you want to put
[43:18] it it's simply explaining to me is how
[43:23] that God condescends to humanity for
[43:27] Humanity to understand
[43:32] him so he C to sins he comes down to the
[43:37] logos the theop the great big words that
[43:40] we use so than to might try to let
[43:43] everybody think how smart we
[43:49] are but yet we come down to the to the
[43:53] point like I asked the question one time
[43:55] we're talking about son of God I said
[43:57] when the Son of God appear in in Bible
[44:02] terminologies he said well 2,000 years
[44:05] ago I said that's how much you
[44:12] think God when it was called a Son of
[44:15] God was the logos back in Genesis that
[44:18] your Scholars
[44:20] knew because it's known as word or logos
[44:23] or
[44:24] speech the son of God
[44:27] trying to get a point to you just
[44:30] think a positive point of
[44:36] thinking light will put Darkness out
[44:42] true all right so as God unveils
[44:48] himself light becomes into view our
[44:53] thought or to
[44:55] our understanding
[44:58] but we don't want to leave him as
[45:00] Darkness cuz he never was as
[45:05] Darkness but put it to the point that
[45:08] he's now trying to let himself be known
[45:12] as
[45:16] light then he can create the moon and
[45:19] the stars and the sun later and let them
[45:23] control and all and we call that light
[45:29] but that was not what God created in the
[45:30] beginning so he never created he stepped
[45:33] over into another
[45:35] form he amored
[45:37] himself changed his
[45:41] form from being
[45:45] unseen to where he can be
[45:51] seen and the first thing comes forth is
[45:54] light light is what brings it out out
[45:57] into the open to be able to be
[46:01] seen but it's dealing with the mind more
[46:05] than it's dealing with an actuality of
[46:07] well it was see it was dark and then it
[46:10] become light and
[46:12] then
[46:18] see when Jesus said I am the
[46:21] resurrection and the
[46:24] life he was showing us that he was that
[46:27] very God that created all things back in
[46:31] Genesis and that he was the
[46:37] light all
[46:39] right you remember we brought these
[46:44] out as God tries to unveil himself he
[46:47] begins to bring himself down and when
[46:50] Moses which had written this part you
[46:53] know in his
[46:55] writings after he got through writing
[46:58] the things he was writing he
[47:04] built put it in her skin the things that
[47:07] God told him to put into being right and
[47:11] he made the Ark of the Covenant he made
[47:13] all of the thing he made everything to
[47:15] lay it out he laid out the outer Court
[47:18] inner Court holy of
[47:24] holies and there he was in that very
[47:26] chag of
[47:29] Glory that behind that veil of the inner
[47:32] Veil you
[47:34] know you didn't need no
[47:36] [Music]
[47:39] light God is still trying to reveal
[47:43] himself trying to make your known you
[47:46] didn't need no light you had to have
[47:49] light in the outer court because it was
[47:51] day and
[47:52] night all right inner Court going into
[47:55] the second part you had the
[47:59] candlesticks they had to be kept
[48:01] lit but behind the veil there kind of
[48:05] Glory how many of them do you want where
[48:07] brother B says never did go out year
[48:10] after
[48:12] year you had to relight them candles you
[48:14] had to do all them
[48:16] things but that high
[48:19] priest when he would walk behind there
[48:23] he didn't stumble all over
[48:25] everything it was
[48:28] light brother R said a soft glowing
[48:32] light when time he called it smooth I
[48:34] got a bunch of them written
[48:36] down of what it was behind the
[48:39] veil but just remember it was
[48:43] light what was happening the god that
[48:47] created all
[48:49] things and unveiled himself as light in
[48:52] the beginning he's going to stay
[48:55] light but he's going going to try to
[48:57] express himself as
[48:59] light all
[49:02] [Music]
[49:05] right it's a smooth
[49:08] light and he lived it was there all the
[49:12] time day and night he walked in the
[49:16] light of the Living
[49:20] God what about
[49:24] it what kind of a supernatural light was
[49:27] behind the
[49:34] veil brother random said on one of them
[49:37] I've got in here somewhere or maybe last
[49:39] week's notes cuz I've had these a
[49:42] while he said that light was a
[49:48] rainbow well now what if today in our
[49:50] day what do you recognize or relate as a
[49:54] rainbow
[50:01] come on ain't nobody going to say
[50:06] it it ain't too good of a sign
[50:11] today
[50:13] right rainbow ain't too good of a
[50:19] sign but you know to Noah it was a great
[50:22] sign
[50:27] it was a
[50:30] covenant it was
[50:35] light
[50:37] light was the rainbow
[50:44] color but yet we think don't want well I
[50:47] just don't like that rainbow color well
[50:50] I F have been Noah I'd for love it I
[50:52] mean i' sure love it would
[50:54] you I love it too because I remember
[50:57] when I was a kid I was told you know
[51:00] like everybody's always told their kids
[51:01] these stories and that's why I get on to
[51:03] you for don't scare your kids with your
[51:06] thoughts about God when you can't put
[51:07] them together anyway but you scare your
[51:10] kids with about these things they had
[51:12] told me that when the end of the world
[51:14] had
[51:15] come that there would be a great big
[51:18] cloud come up in the sky and it' just be
[51:21] so dark until it would just be and it
[51:24] would the world would just end
[51:29] well every time it come up a cloud I
[51:32] went out in the
[51:37] yard
[51:41] right
[51:42] cuz that's what I was
[51:46] told but you know what I saw a lot of
[51:48] clouds come and go and I never did wind
[51:50] up the end of the
[51:54] world but see we take and we just take
[51:57] words and thoughts and ideas and and
[52:00] just throw them
[52:03] out and we don't consider how in
[52:06] relation that it can have to
[52:10] mankind as I said to Noah with a rainbow
[52:15] Covenant beautiful thing in the sky that
[52:18] day you go out anytime you want to take
[52:20] your water hose you wash in your car and
[52:23] you just take it and you just spray it
[52:25] across like that and there's the
[52:27] prettiest rainbow you've ever
[52:29] seen brother Tom faush and us we used to
[52:32] ride around a lot on Sunday afternoon
[52:34] and one Sunday we left and went down by
[52:37] the house and we got about almost a
[52:39] mazille and there was just this
[52:43] rainbow I mean it was just so much till
[52:46] it just went from one side of the Earth
[52:48] to the other you know you don't see a
[52:51] lot of that you generally see parts or
[52:53] what I ain't talking about no little old
[52:55] bitty you know you could barely make out
[52:57] I'm talking
[52:59] about beautiful rainbow
[53:02] colors and we life remarked about it
[53:05] went over to comeer stopped and got us
[53:07] about to eat we came
[53:10] out and uh we were looking and I was
[53:13] still back but it was only just parts of
[53:15] that
[53:16] rainbow you know but it was still
[53:17] beautiful it was not just like youd see
[53:19] just a little bitty one it would had the
[53:21] real dark colors you know in it so we
[53:24] get in the car and we start driving up
[53:25] the expressway
[53:27] well all at
[53:29] once I said I've always heard that at
[53:32] the end of the rainbow was pot of gold
[53:35] you ever heard
[53:37] that well you know what come why she'll
[53:40] verify
[53:41] this right off the side of the road was
[53:44] the prettiest rays of light coming down
[53:48] and it did it looked like that that they
[53:51] wasn't a green tree they was nothing it
[53:53] was just
[53:55] gold all around that
[53:58] place
[54:00] well that was
[54:02] light we begin to find out it was no
[54:04] gold there cuz we had the gold riding in
[54:06] the car with
[54:08] us he was inside of
[54:11] us all right what about the
[54:16] light the sh kind of
[54:18] Glory would put forth a
[54:22] light you know
[54:26] that would lighten up the
[54:28] whole room that it was
[54:32] in well do you think that if you put it
[54:35] outside somewhere that it would run out
[54:39] of
[54:42] light because according to what brother
[54:45] R says in the future
[54:47] home that that light can be seen all
[54:49] over the whole
[54:52] world you read the book
[54:56] all over the whole world you say yeah
[54:58] but that's down on the dark side all
[55:01] right you explain what I'm talking about
[55:02] and we don't worry about what where it's
[55:04] down there I used to think I used to
[55:06] think if you dug too deep in a well
[55:08] you'd fall out the other side what' you
[55:12] think they used to tell us that people
[55:15] on the other side of the Earth was
[55:16] hanging upside
[55:17] down that's why their eyes was
[55:22] slanted so you're silly
[55:26] I agree with you but that's what it was
[55:28] told
[55:32] us didn't necessarily make it
[55:35] true but listen I'm trying to express
[55:38] about a
[55:41] light a light
[55:45] that the Shak Glory was just a partial
[55:49] telling of
[55:50] it the rainbow is just a partial
[55:54] revealing of it
[55:58] but the Lord Jesus as I said this
[56:00] morning bringing out when he said I am
[56:02] the
[56:03] resurrection you know he said I'm the
[56:08] light
[56:10] right he said I'm the
[56:14] light well listen was
[56:18] he but did he have this great glow
[56:21] around him that lit up the buildings and
[56:23] the world and everything as he walked
[56:26] that evidently wasn't what he was
[56:28] talking
[56:30] about but he said he was the light of
[56:32] the world and he said let's
[56:36] see as long
[56:41] john let me get my
[56:44] glasses we I going to read the
[56:47] scripture John 9 and5 as long as I'm in
[56:51] the
[56:52] world I am the
[56:55] light of of the
[57:01] world is that physical
[57:09] light John 8 and12 he
[57:13] says I am the light of the world he that
[57:17] followeth me shall not walk in
[57:20] darkness but she'll have the
[57:22] light of life
[57:29] read it the light of
[57:37] Life Matthew 5:14 he said you are the
[57:42] light of the
[57:49] world
[57:52] right now he goes here through the
[57:55] scriptures to bring us to the point that
[57:57] he's first telling he's the light as
[57:59] long as he's here there'll be
[58:03] light but then he declares you're the
[58:08] light well he's evidently talking about
[58:10] the same light right I mean wouldn't you
[58:13] think
[58:17] so we used to sing them little songs you
[58:20] know them little children This Little
[58:24] Light of Mine I'm going to let Let It
[58:26] Shine kid still do it here on some
[58:32] time not going to blow it out not going
[58:34] to put it under a bush
[58:39] not what is the
[58:42] light that could be talking about that
[58:45] could be what he was that could wind up
[58:49] to be the same in you and
[58:52] me that we could be the light
[58:57] it would have to be the light of
[59:01] Life did you read
[59:04] that light of
[59:07] Life he's the light of life but if he
[59:10] lives in
[59:14] us then we're the
[59:18] light that's why I love the thoughts a
[59:20] prophet would
[59:22] bring he said he's not complete without
[59:25] us
[59:26] even says the godhead right is that
[59:29] quote godhead is not complete without
[59:32] you you realize if you took out one
[59:38] candle you would have a
[59:41] problem huh well it's still light now it
[59:45] ain't
[59:48] to he ain't complete without us you know
[59:51] why cuz here's where he's living
[59:58] he what would be the word used moved or
[1:00:01] transported or descended or what from
[1:00:05] being the fact of existing
[1:00:11] alone and then you see him as he comes
[1:00:14] forth and he's declaring himself as to
[1:00:17] all of the things throughout the four
[1:00:19] gospels but the main point he's bringing
[1:00:22] is you're the
[1:00:24] light that took place on the day of
[1:00:26] Pentecost
[1:00:28] right not talking about natural light
[1:00:31] now I got them in here if you want to do
[1:00:34] them you know that you the human being
[1:00:37] go ahead to number
[1:00:39] eight cuz we're going to separate a
[1:00:41] little bit from cosmic light to Eternal
[1:00:46] Light under Cosmic
[1:00:50] light now watch from the uncertain sound
[1:00:57] when you were made when you were made
[1:01:00] and they just found out recently that
[1:01:02] your body is full of
[1:01:06] light x-ray proves
[1:01:09] that the X-ray does not have any light
[1:01:13] of its
[1:01:14] own now they'd probably argue with you
[1:01:17] down at the at the doctor's
[1:01:20] office but we ain't worry about the
[1:01:21] doctor we know who the doctor is
[1:01:26] it's your light that it
[1:01:29] uses they have
[1:01:31] proven they have taken pictures and
[1:01:34] proven of people holding their hand out
[1:01:37] to touch another person and Rays of
[1:01:39] light
[1:01:42] moving
[1:01:44] right is that blind to anybody or you
[1:01:48] understand that's what they've done
[1:01:51] it now watch it's your light that it
[1:01:55] uses you're born with four
[1:02:00] Rays most of us is done
[1:02:06] past it's your Li to uses you're born
[1:02:08] with four
[1:02:10] Rays after a little while say 20 25 one
[1:02:14] ray goes
[1:02:16] out 35 another or 40 another one goes
[1:02:21] out and finally when you get past about
[1:02:24] 65 you're living on your last
[1:02:31] R
[1:02:33] now in case you missed it you're going
[1:02:36] on down below it he said now that's
[1:02:38] Cosmic
[1:02:39] light he's explaining natural
[1:02:44] light it is not the Holy Ghost lighting
[1:02:47] up there that's in every human
[1:02:50] being Cosmic
[1:02:53] light but it gives the point Earth
[1:02:55] thought to look
[1:02:58] at that you mean to say that within us
[1:03:02] as human beings created The Way We Were
[1:03:05] and brought into being then God put a
[1:03:08] cosmic light
[1:03:15] there
[1:03:19] right now if he put a cosmic light how
[1:03:22] much more light would it be with the
[1:03:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost goes when it
[1:03:26] says ye are the light of the world it
[1:03:27] ain't talking about Cosmic light now
[1:03:29] come
[1:03:31] on when the Bible says you're the light
[1:03:34] of the world ain't talking about Cosmic
[1:03:35] light ain't talking about X-rays and
[1:03:37] pictures
[1:03:40] taken it's telling you what is exactly
[1:03:43] what I just said the only way you and I
[1:03:46] can be light is for that original light
[1:03:49] to come in
[1:03:51] us and
[1:03:53] live in the new birth
[1:03:58] that's why the new birth is the most
[1:03:59] important thing there is
[1:04:02] amen the Bible speaks of how that your
[1:04:07] body see I got that in
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:18] yeah your body is full of
[1:04:21] light but that's Cosmic
[1:04:26] Cosmic light which is means some way
[1:04:29] some Ray some point some thought that
[1:04:33] God done and he put it into the human
[1:04:38] being now it ain't no glowing light that
[1:04:40] it's like Eternal Light bub on and you
[1:04:44] know it's
[1:04:49] life within us is
[1:04:54] life right
[1:04:57] now get the
[1:05:00] point is I said then if that is
[1:05:03] light and even Cosmic light will show up
[1:05:07] what about the Holy Ghost that's living
[1:05:09] within
[1:05:13] you see it ain't going to be Cosmic
[1:05:15] light in the future
[1:05:18] home you know what I me ain't no need of
[1:05:22] cosmic light in a future home
[1:05:27] the future home there is no light
[1:05:30] because he's the
[1:05:31] light well if he's living in every one
[1:05:34] of us then you're the
[1:05:36] light that's what he was speaking of
[1:05:38] when he said you're the light of the
[1:05:39] world now Naturally Speaking what does
[1:05:41] he
[1:05:42] saying first off the point what he's
[1:05:45] saying if you're the
[1:05:46] light there's no
[1:05:48] way that anyone can see God except
[1:05:51] through somebody else
[1:05:57] now I saw God it
[1:06:01] now I tell you what I never didn't hear
[1:06:03] a preacher and I got born again you
[1:06:05] heard somebody because it's
[1:06:08] impossible to be born again without
[1:06:10] hearing the word that's
[1:06:17] right
[1:06:19] right so our light right now is to let
[1:06:22] our light shine before men that they
[1:06:25] they see God is that
[1:06:29] scriptural let our
[1:06:34] life what did we read that in a while
[1:06:40] ago
[1:06:41] life lot of
[1:06:46] life you see why your life is so
[1:06:51] important you see even what I was
[1:06:53] talking about a moment ago
[1:06:57] when I talking about simple plain thing
[1:07:00] that if we're negative we got a DM
[1:07:05] light
[1:07:07] right we're all down and
[1:07:10] out we've got a dam
[1:07:15] light but if you're happy and
[1:07:19] joyous your light glows
[1:07:26] so Jesus was saying to us all right I'm
[1:07:29] going to give up my life we've come down
[1:07:31] I've explained it to you I've brought it
[1:07:33] to Moses I told Moses all about the
[1:07:36] creation brought it through I brought it
[1:07:38] through the shakana glory I brought it
[1:07:40] through all of the lights and brought it
[1:07:42] through the the rainbow I brought it
[1:07:44] through the fact you remember what it
[1:07:45] was it was in in the daytime it was it
[1:07:49] was a rainbow or a pillar of fire and at
[1:07:52] night then it it was a light or a cloud
[1:07:55] excuse me daytime was a cloud and night
[1:07:57] it was a pillar of fire the
[1:08:01] light that's how they knew where to go
[1:08:03] where they wanted to go was by
[1:08:06] that what are you saying I'm saying
[1:08:10] church when are we going to realize that
[1:08:12] the life we're living before the people
[1:08:14] of this world is the only light they'll
[1:08:16] ever see of
[1:08:21] God they said can't see God they see
[1:08:24] Cosmic light
[1:08:26] they see rays and things like that and
[1:08:28] they try to make it something
[1:08:31] great the greatest light there is is to
[1:08:34] let your life shine before men to be a
[1:08:38] Christian every day you live
[1:08:43] right remember that's the only God a lot
[1:08:46] of people see is
[1:08:50] you
[1:08:52] right I remember working with these two
[1:08:54] women in the cotton Mill New Holland
[1:08:56] Mill I worked with him a couple of years
[1:08:59] and this lady she went come unglued one
[1:09:02] day and told everybody
[1:09:06] off I wasn't a preacher back then but I
[1:09:08] tried to live a decent life and we're
[1:09:11] over there working a little bit and she
[1:09:13] comes she said Sam I'm
[1:09:15] sorry I
[1:09:18] apologize I shouldn't have got mad said
[1:09:21] all them things I said oh that's all
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:26] I said that's that's okay I said we all
[1:09:28] have our good days and bad
[1:09:31] days she said Sam said I've been with
[1:09:33] you two
[1:09:34] years I've never seen you
[1:09:39] down
[1:09:43] well maybe that's a good
[1:09:48] point but you've heard your Prophet
[1:09:50] expressing it right that the people see
[1:09:53] God in you and want to be like
[1:09:57] that right we want our children to live
[1:10:01] like us and do like
[1:10:07] us God wants his children to do
[1:10:11] that
[1:10:17] light so when we get to that future home
[1:10:26] the Bible says you have no need of the
[1:10:28] light say because the lamb is the
[1:10:33] light you have no need of a temple he
[1:10:36] said because God is the
[1:10:39] temple is it doing away with
[1:10:42] things or is he coming back to where he
[1:10:46] originally
[1:10:51] was now I'm stopping on that point where
[1:10:54] you'll think
[1:10:57] see that's why I don't believe that
[1:10:59] there was a Darkness like we
[1:11:03] read I don't believe that I believe
[1:11:05] that's the terminologies or statements
[1:11:07] of humanity to describe
[1:11:11] things I believe when God existed
[1:11:15] alone he was
[1:11:18] light cuz the Bible says that in him is
[1:11:21] no
[1:11:22] Darkness he didn't come from Darkness to
[1:11:26] light there never was a darkness in his
[1:11:31] presence the future home to me is going
[1:11:34] back to the closest we'll ever get I
[1:11:36] said that the way I meant it I mean it
[1:11:38] the way I say it the closest we'll ever
[1:11:40] get back to originality is the future
[1:11:44] home I believe that why would you want
[1:11:47] to go any
[1:11:50] further I get so tickled at listening to
[1:11:53] people preach on predestination
[1:11:55] I I I get tickled at it I I don't mean
[1:11:58] life I just life at the humanity of what
[1:12:01] we
[1:12:02] are and they predestinate so
[1:12:04] predestination be careful if he was
[1:12:08] self-existing
[1:12:10] you could predestinate Yourself clean
[1:12:13] out of
[1:12:15] existence you better stop a little
[1:12:18] before that it gets to self-existing
[1:12:25] I don't want to go any
[1:12:27] further than the
[1:12:29] point that he said let there be
[1:12:37] light that you follow my thought I don't
[1:12:41] want to go any further back the
[1:12:44] predestination carries you back and if
[1:12:46] you go back to pre-existence you've
[1:12:49] predestinated yourself out of
[1:12:51] existence because it's pre-existent
[1:12:53] he'll never be pre-exist
[1:12:58] he'll never exist alone I've got the
[1:13:00] quotes from The Prophet you need
[1:13:06] that he'll never be self-existing
[1:13:11] right why because he's got his
[1:13:16] family in that future
[1:13:19] home will be the closest
[1:13:23] position of anything about any and all
[1:13:27] of your
[1:13:32] predestination because you'll live with
[1:13:34] him for
[1:13:38] eternity you said well I just can't
[1:13:40] understand out okay I'll give you
[1:13:42] another one if you can't understand it
[1:13:43] tell me how he's my savior he's my
[1:13:45] father he's my brother he's my
[1:13:48] husband he's my
[1:13:51] Advocate you explain to me how all
[1:13:53] that's true out of one person
[1:13:58] am I right he's my brother he's my
[1:14:01] father he's brother brother said he's
[1:14:03] easy with my
[1:14:08] mother what about it
[1:14:11] church just trying to make a little
[1:14:13] point to end of
[1:14:15] thought I'm trying to end it right there
[1:14:18] I'm ending it with that last
[1:14:22] thought let's don't predestinate our
[1:14:25] eles out of
[1:14:27] existence I don't want him to go back to
[1:14:29] the place that he exists
[1:14:36] alone I want to go back to the place
[1:14:39] that we can exist in
[1:14:41] eternity with
[1:14:49] him so what did we wind up
[1:14:52] Bing Sunday we talked about it
[1:14:57] the Earth will be made
[1:15:00] Eternal he said well I don't believe
[1:15:02] that okay that's your problem it ain't
[1:15:04] mine I mean it ain't
[1:15:06] mine I'm just stating
[1:15:10] it the world is to be made Eternal
[1:15:14] because it's to be made a new
[1:15:16] creation he makes all things
[1:15:20] new all right so then if the world's
[1:15:23] eternal
[1:15:25] and we got an eternal
[1:15:32] city right the future home build
[1:15:36] according to your desires and
[1:15:39] thoughts that's your
[1:15:42] home you're going to live in it for
[1:15:48] eternity if we can reach that place I
[1:15:51] don't want to go any further
[1:15:57] right I don't want to go no further than
[1:16:00] a total
[1:16:02] eternity existing with my
[1:16:07] father existing with my brothers and my
[1:16:12] sister as a part of the family of
[1:16:16] God there won't be no need of a
[1:16:21] light cuz he's the light
[1:16:27] if one match can put out all the
[1:16:29] darkness and it's a kind of Glory can be
[1:16:31] glowing so
[1:16:34] great until it never goes
[1:16:38] out what about a day when we get
[1:16:45] there you're the
[1:16:50] light if he's not complete without us
[1:16:54] then if he goes back to that
[1:16:56] self-existing I go out of
[1:17:00] existence but he'll never go to
[1:17:02] self-existing
[1:17:05] you go back to his original
[1:17:09] thought of what he
[1:17:13] wanted what did he
[1:17:15] want a
[1:17:20] family Sons and
[1:17:23] Daughters to be like
[1:17:28] him come on church I don't agree with it
[1:17:31] of it being but it is so amazing how
[1:17:34] that your movie Industries and things
[1:17:37] can can try to portray the things and
[1:17:40] that was so great with brother brandham
[1:17:42] until when he seen that Ten Commandments
[1:17:44] and seen how they done that writing he
[1:17:47] knew that it happened some way and that
[1:17:49] related to him till he he enjoyed that
[1:17:52] thought of seeing that and if any of
[1:17:55] ever seen it it was evidently they done
[1:17:57] it with powder or something and put it
[1:17:59] there and let it just burn out and it
[1:18:01] just and he just wrote them letters in
[1:18:04] stone he said that's just exactly like
[1:18:07] it
[1:18:12] was I don't want to go to self to where
[1:18:15] he goes to self-existing
[1:18:17] I want him to be my
[1:18:21] father I want to be the son he wanted
[1:18:27] I want to be the person he wants me to
[1:18:30] be cuz that way then if I'm part of him
[1:18:34] then he's not complete without me but
[1:18:36] now come on let's get to Life's part if
[1:18:38] I'm part of God and you're part of God
[1:18:39] then we're part of each
[1:18:42] other whether you like it or
[1:18:46] not brother Dale I don't want to be a
[1:18:49] part of you well that might be true in
[1:18:51] the cosmic light area of time I'm might
[1:18:55] not want to be part of
[1:18:57] you but when we get all of that out of
[1:19:00] the way and we all get eternal
[1:19:04] life ain't going to be no
[1:19:08] worrying he said I never thought when
[1:19:11] you started that series on life that
[1:19:14] you'd wind up
[1:19:15] there where we wound up back as far as I
[1:19:18] want to go and I don't want to go no
[1:19:21] further than the point of being able to
[1:19:25] stand with my father and let him be made
[1:19:28] manifest through
[1:19:30] me and we can stand there as light not
[1:19:34] glowing balls have to hang around say
[1:19:37] about you see these uh movies what do
[1:19:39] they make them now come on kids somebody
[1:19:41] help me like what they call it Mortal
[1:19:43] Combat if I'm wrong on these things I
[1:19:46] don't watch it so I've just seen the
[1:19:48] points of whatever magazine got about
[1:19:50] and they claim those people are so
[1:19:54] great until they're just
[1:19:58] invisible they're just going beyond
[1:20:01] anything could be comprehended of them
[1:20:03] and they're totally invisible that's why
[1:20:04] they call it Mortal Combat they can't be
[1:20:08] killed and church they're pretty
[1:20:12] close I remember brother Harris telling
[1:20:14] about that they showed in a movie one
[1:20:16] time because you go to so many degrees
[1:20:18] you get first degree second goes up to
[1:20:21] eight I think it is they have no more
[1:20:23] fighting
[1:20:26] and they showed this big old 2,000lb
[1:20:29] bull this was supposed to been out it
[1:20:32] charged the
[1:20:35] guy he just stepped
[1:20:40] aside whacked his horn
[1:20:46] off the bull turned to charge and coming
[1:20:49] back full speed he stood dead still
[1:20:55] when that bull got to one spot pop Right
[1:20:58] Between the
[1:20:59] Eyes the bull fell on the ground you
[1:21:03] want to run in front of a 2,000lb car
[1:21:06] it's going to knock you a long
[1:21:08] ways my point there are things that
[1:21:12] these human beings you tell me David
[1:21:13] didn't know these things now I've always
[1:21:15] argued this you can argue all you want I
[1:21:17] ain't going to argue about I'm just tell
[1:21:18] my point see David knew all about
[1:21:22] karate and all of these things
[1:21:25] he wasn't no little old thing we hear
[1:21:27] brother brandham and I agree he said
[1:21:30] that demon up there could have tore him
[1:21:33] to pieces but just remember you're also
[1:21:35] talking about a guy that had won 15
[1:21:38] professional
[1:21:42] fights but he knew them professional
[1:21:44] fights wouldn't no good cuz there was a
[1:21:46] demon out there that was more capable
[1:21:49] than all of them natural combats would
[1:21:51] you tell me David and them didn't know
[1:21:53] about karates and
[1:22:02] thing what are you
[1:22:05] saying I say I'm looking at the light of
[1:22:07] the
[1:22:11] world but I'm looking at the body of
[1:22:13] Jesus
[1:22:15] Christ there'll always be
[1:22:19] light that's why we can agree and talk
[1:22:23] to each other about
[1:22:25] Christ and life and doing is because
[1:22:29] we're his
[1:22:33] children we get to that future
[1:22:37] home all will be
[1:22:45] Eternal We'll Be Eternal now with him
[1:22:48] what a
[1:22:52] day those we talking about this morning
[1:22:54] he said I am the resurrection I didn't
[1:22:57] emphasize that about me and you right
[1:23:00] but this evening I'm emphasizing one
[1:23:02] thing he said I'm the light of the
[1:23:05] world as long as I'm in the world he
[1:23:08] said I'll be the light of the
[1:23:10] world when he left this world he came
[1:23:13] back into the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:23:16] the light has never went
[1:23:19] out ye are the lot of the world
[1:23:24] light can't be put under a bush or what
[1:23:26] it's set on a
[1:23:28] hill he knew where that future home was
[1:23:30] going to
[1:23:31] be set on the hill Mountains will cleave
[1:23:35] and up it'll go the mountain do see you
[1:23:39] be gone cuz it won't be no more seea in
[1:23:41] that
[1:23:44] area what about it come on musician
