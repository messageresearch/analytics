[30:56] uh there's 80 people on this list of
[30:58] just family members in this congregation
[31:00] that need
[31:01] salvation 80 people that I pray for
[31:05] every
[31:06] day I talked brother Joe and he was also
[31:09] I don't know if he was going to do it or
[31:11] not but he was talking about getting a
[31:12] picture face he's going to Facebook and
[31:15] getting all the pictures he can if
[31:16] anybody else knows of any of the
[31:17] pictures these people that we can put
[31:20] aside of them because a picture to a
[31:21] name means a lot but but here's 80
[31:24] people and I know some of you hadn't
[31:26] even hadn't put your children on here
[31:27] yet and some of you had requested to be
[31:30] put on here yourself so uh let's get
[31:33] this thing done um it's a wonderful
[31:36] thing that you I said every morning
[31:38] before I start my day I said every
[31:40] morning I pray over these names right
[31:42] here lay my hands on them call most of
[31:44] them 90% of them a lot of times I don't

[31:54] doubt you even Sav yourself that's right
[31:59] I got one amen that was about
[32:01] it thank you if you don't want your kids

[32:19] don't that I don't pray for every day
[32:21] you just have to keep them on your heart
[32:22] and on your mind and for another thing I
[32:24] want to u to uh tell you about thing
[32:28] that we're going to do starting February
[32:30] the 23rd in at Keller Williams realy in
[32:34] Gainesville uh junor N I know somebody
[32:36] you know that we went through the
[32:37] financial piece university uh classes
[32:40] with Dave Ramy last year and U it's been
[32:43] you know I've been kind of dwelling on
[32:45] it myself and you say well we're we're
[32:47] bride and we're getting out of here I
[32:49] was telling the kids downstairs in the
[32:50] Sunday school class that you know
[32:52] brother brandom said if you knew God was
[32:54] coming tomorrow and you were going to
[32:55] plant potatoes
[32:58] what' he say stop no he said plan if you
[33:01] were going to get married he said get
[33:03] married he said if you're going to build
[33:05] a house he said if you knew God was
[33:07] coming tomorrow build a house all right
[33:10] so on February the 23rd at the Kelly
[33:12] Williams build building we'll have it
[33:13] downstairs for you to to look over we
[33:17] will be doing a u a class at uh at Kell
[33:22] Williams every Thursday night starting
[33:24] March the 1st for 13 weeks to
[33:28] um help us you say well I don't need any
[33:31] help I can do it myself well if you
[33:32] hadn't done it
[33:33] already you know the Lord the holy
[33:36] spirit's in all of us but he also give
[33:38] us pastors and deacons and masas and
[33:41] daddies if we knew how to do it we're
[33:44] sheep people we need to be led all right
[33:47] and this is not a get rich quck scheme
[33:49] this is taking the money that you make
[33:52] now and do and doing better with it it's
[33:55] a faith-based uh it was mentioned to do
[33:58] it here at church but I don't want to do
[33:59] it in the sanctuary CU there'll be a lot
[34:01] of talking and you do have to do videos
[34:03] and there's nothing wrong with uh with
[34:05] what he brings out um I just give you a
[34:09] little testimony June and I we started
[34:11] when February janary January of last
[34:14] year and we took the 13we course and in
[34:17] that 13we course we we paid off $6,500
[34:20] in credit card debt and other debts that
[34:22] we had just in that 13 weeks and we
[34:24] didn't do anything special except
[34:26] Sterling was happy enough to pay me
[34:28] $1,500 for my four-wheeler so that kind
[34:30] of
[34:32] helps but it's taking the money and
[34:34] resources that you already have not
[34:36] trying to get it from somewhere else all
[34:38] right so if you're interested in joining
[34:40] February the 23rd at 7:00 we're going to
[34:42] have a preview it'll be a preview for
[34:44] about 30 minutes and then March the 1st
[34:47] we'll start classes at 7:00 to 9:00 at
[34:50] carer Williams rail game brother Joe
[34:53] will be putting it on the on the website
[34:55] for us to to look at if anybody else has
[34:59] any um anybody else that you think that
[35:01] you might want to attend um there's no
[35:04] charge for the preview and there's no
[35:06] charge for one U class the kit is
[35:11] $93 uh plus shipping and handling is
[35:14] $951 so we always say it's the best $100
[35:16] you'll ever spend because out of that
[35:18] $100 Jun and not save $6,500 in 13 weeks
[35:22] and we did not do anything special we
[35:23] didn't go borrow money from anybody we
[35:26] we did it with what we had but um it'll
[35:29] help us all I think that that we all
[35:31] feel better if we have a little money uh
[35:33] I know we're not building the kingdom
[35:35] for down here but you know what it
[35:37] always feels good to know you know that
[35:40] God give us the ability to be good
[35:43] stewards not just of the land but be
[35:46] good stewards of his money because I
[35:48] told him downstairs you know God God
[35:50] does more with 10% and we can do a
[35:53] 90% he doesn't go look at the stop
[35:55] report every week he doesn't get up
[35:57] every morning and look at Wall Street he
[35:59] takes the 10% that he gets and he just
[36:02] he he just rules his whole Kingdom with
[36:04] that 10% but um you'll understand let me
[36:08] give you one little thing brother uh uh
[36:11] Dave Ramy said that he said only 3% of
[36:13] Evangelical Christians
[36:15] tithe
[36:17] 3% and I know that 90% of you do but
[36:21] only 3% look at these great big
[36:23] buildings they built God's blessing
[36:25] somebody just out of that 3%
[36:29] but you're robbing yourself of a
[36:30] blessing if you're not tithing and and
[36:32] the tithe don't go to brother Dale the
[36:34] tithe goes to God so you're not robbing
[36:36] brother Dale of the money you're robbing
[36:37] god of the money and God don't need your
[36:39] money but you know what we're sheep we
[36:41] have to be led we're told that we are to
[36:44] give 10% and in this
[36:48] class you will see how that you can take
[36:50] the money that you already are making
[36:53] and you can do more with it and have
[36:55] more uh I told him downstairs there's
[36:57] not a I'm not 100% behind Dave Ramsey's
[37:01] philosophy but at least 90% And if I'm
[37:03] 90% right most of the time that's not
[37:05] too bad so being 90% is better than than
[37:09] what we were doing it really made um
[37:12] June and I were really you know had had
[37:14] a good time at the class and we got to
[37:15] meet some new people there but U if
[37:18] you're interested like I said we'll post
[37:20] posters downstairs but February the 23rd
[37:22] at 7:00 we we will have a preview and of
[37:26] the class and then we will begin the
[37:29] classes on March the 1st so just think
[37:33] about it I know we all uh I told him
[37:37] downstairs it's interesting that uh even
[37:41] when I wasn't serving the
[37:43] lord I still thought I should watch my
[37:46] money cuz I knew God give it to me I me
[37:48] I wasn't a Christian but I knew and I
[37:50] know Ryan said he he came to me today
[37:52] and said he's got a testimony of taking
[37:54] the a part of the class on in uh on CDs
[37:58] and uh that it will really bless you and
[38:01] it will because you know spiritual or
[38:05] not we got to live every day we got to
[38:07] get up every morning we got to go to
[38:08] work there's a thing comes in every
[38:10] month called a
[38:12] bill lights gas whether you have a fin
[38:15] whether you have a a house bill or not
[38:17] you've got water bill and light bills
[38:20] and bills bells and that's right and you
[38:23] got uh kids that give you bells and
[38:27] amen hallelujah to that I know that but
[38:30] uh this will help I think it will but on
[38:33] March the 1st it will be open to
[38:34] everybody so but it will be a Christian
[38:36] based faith-based uh totally from the
[38:39] Bible scriptural class if anybody wants
[38:41] to attend so now you can
[38:45] call
[38:48] Sor let's stand and change the order of

[40:40] amen that are working with them and
[40:43] helping them and get them to singing and
[40:45] doing and taking the services and
[40:47] everything we really appreciate that
[40:49] because you know that is really a a time
[40:52] and an hour that our kids need to be
[40:55] involved that's right do you know in the
[40:58] work of the Lord start training them up
[40:59] early and then they won't have no
[41:01] trouble later on right amen so remember
[41:03] that if you'd like turn in your
[41:04] scripture turn to Matthew
[41:07] 5 and first Peter we read this morning
[41:10] and then we'll get into the questions
[41:13] and comments and things and I hope
[41:16] you've enjoyed this series and we'll do
[41:20] that and like I said we'll be probably
[41:22] taking a few topics of things that are
[41:26] doctrines in the m message around the
[41:29] the thing the message of the hour and
[41:32] you know speaking upon those things to
[41:34] try to show why we don't believe this or
[41:36] why we don't believe that or why we do
[41:38] believe this or whatever and try to put
[41:40] it into the Bible and things so if you
[41:43] have one write it down and say you know
[41:46] would you speak on this so we'll put
[41:49] everything together and get it all you
[41:51] know related to uh the Bible and things
[41:54] and just have a good time I encourage
[41:57] enourage you to uh sign up with way and
[41:59] them about the things they he asked me
[42:02] about it I said sure go ahead and

[45:06] last we read this morning verse 13 of
[45:10] First Peter wherefore gir up the loins
[45:15] of your mind be sober in hope to the end
[45:17] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[45:19] you at the
[45:20] revelation of Jesus Christ you may be
[45:23] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[45:26] reading of the word you give
[45:30] that
[45:32] yeah now we're giving out a copy of
[45:36] report that brother Joe we asked him to
[45:39] kind of run up a report to you know how
[45:41] we were doing on the internet system and
[45:44] things and uh you know looking at it and
[45:47] uh we really appreciate the fact that we
[45:51] can say that there is a lot of people
[45:54] listening you got one yes I
[45:58] and uh you know we really we really
[46:00] appreciate the Lord allowing us to do
[46:03] this because it's you see that's the
[46:07] your money you're putting in and all is
[46:09] paying for the things to be able to get
[46:12] the message out and it is getting out
[46:16] you will see when you get the paper that
[46:18] it's getting out pretty heavily at least
[46:20] there is a uh you
[46:22] know somebody's clicking on and doing
[46:25] something and to the internet system
[46:28] people out there that are watching live
[46:30] and those that will watch on other times
[46:33] we appreciate you we we thank God that
[46:36] you have count us worthy to listen to us
[46:39] a little bit and you know and we hope
[46:42] that we have been a help to you to uh be
[46:45] able to uh speak a few things that maybe
[46:49] you were interesting in at least uh if
[46:52] not if not more than what Paul said that
[46:56] even if you Pi by contention or
[46:58] arguments you know he said he gloried in
[47:01] it so if we are nothing more than uh
[47:04] that part maybe the Gospel of Jesus
[47:06] Christ be placed out and get to the
[47:09] right person we're looking for that
[47:11] final seed and the final seed may be
[47:14] sitting in the seats a lot of people are
[47:15] out there you know going and I believe
[47:17] in it and sending missionaries or people
[47:20] around the world to foreign countries to
[47:22] do those things have been on those
[47:24] places and done a little of it ourselves
[47:26] and thank God for the opportunity but
[47:29] getting down into the old age stage you
[47:32] you're not traveling very much and
[47:34] things but you know maybe we can can get
[47:37] it by internet and you know the systems
[47:39] and people can can hear and and be able
[47:43] to do this we appreciate these brothers
[47:46] that are doing it and you know getting
[47:49] everything done cuz I just simply go in
[47:51] and ask them to bring up something and
[47:54] they they get everything for me and you
[47:57] know they do it and I really appreciate
[47:59] it we kind of gave them a day off today
[48:02] on the quotes and things of putting up
[48:04] and you know just kind of this morning
[48:06] run through a a little
[48:08] thought about the end time because I
[48:12] believe that there is a Grace right and
[48:16] that
[48:18] Grace is the fact that God will not
[48:21] impute
[48:22] sin to someone right that's Grace you
[48:27] just think about it then we found out
[48:28] who that was right that it was a person
[48:31] that was dead to their themselves right
[48:33] and letting Jesus Christ come and live
[48:36] in their
[48:37] hearts and that there would be no sin
[48:40] there to be accounted for all right but
[48:43] see just looking at the uh the report
[48:45] brother Joe gave and uh you know as you
[48:49] got it there and he's putting it on the
[48:52] internet system where they can can do it
[48:55] um for the whole year here as far as the
[48:57] internet
[48:59] system uh we've had and when it's called
[49:02] unique visitors that kind of means like
[49:03] a one per one time click you know
[49:06] somebody coming on new or something and
[49:08] this past year we had
[49:10] 74,2 48 of
[49:12] those but look at the number of visits
[49:14] to our website now these may not be that
[49:17] they do to a whole service and it may be
[49:19] that they just look at pictures but
[49:21] still they do connect on it was
[49:24] 74,000 240 excuse excuse me
[49:28] 133,134
[49:37] 96,6
[49:38] 51 but for hits look at that there been
[49:41] over 5 million there's been
[49:45] 5,927 357 hits that means somebody did
[49:48] at least
[49:49] click somebody did turn on well then you
[49:53] can kind of tell whether they stay with
[49:55] you by how much is used and look what
[49:58] was
[49:59] used
[50:02] 7,459 almost
[50:05] 7,46
[50:07] gigabytes now I can't even count what a
[50:10] gigabyte
[50:11] is I know you know coming down we we
[50:15] used to have the 286 in you know the the
[50:18] 386 and it went to the 486 and none of
[50:21] that was a gig that wasn't even it
[50:23] wasn't even started and that is a lot of
[50:28] information that has been captured out
[50:30] there all right then you look down at
[50:32] the live video since we've been doing it
[50:35] since May yep and you can see that
[50:38] mainly the the looking at it that there
[50:40] has been uh
[50:42] 6,000 uh 180
[50:45] hits they've been visits to it of of
[50:49] 1,39 they've already used up
[50:54] 16147 gab just on live live right just
[50:58] on live so that means somebody is at
[51:01] least listening amen and if they're
[51:03] listening I pray that they would forgive
[51:05] us of all of our problems and troubles
[51:07] and you know if they're looking for a
[51:09] perfect Church to connect on the video
[51:11] you might as well cut it off you know
[51:14] cuz we're not that but we're trying to
[51:15] be perfect in Jesus Christ cuz he's our
[51:18] Perfection and we're just trying to get
[51:20] the message of the hour out on the basis
[51:23] because that was a desire of my heart
[51:26] years go was to be able to go and to
[51:30] speak and you have heard me say it and
[51:31] you know I mean it that like in 82 83
[51:35] and all in there when I was preaching
[51:36] the SE and 74 with the Daniel 70 weeks
[51:40] and all and I'm willing today to do it
[51:43] put your name to it send it to the world
[51:46] and let you get all the glory out of it
[51:47] cuz Jesus Christ is going to get the
[51:49] glory in the end time going be finished
[51:51] but you know I I really appreciate it
[51:54] and I always wanted to and I thought
[51:56] well maybe Wade will be able to go and
[51:58] he's able to go a whole lot more than I
[51:59] was and I'm not against anybody that
[52:02] doesn't want me to come and preach cuz
[52:04] I'm just I know I'm blunt and people are
[52:07] afraid of me they afraid I might be
[52:08] blunt in their Church you know this is
[52:10] I'm blunt here that's really a scared of
[52:13] it I guess but that's all right you
[52:15] know no problems so but anyhow so I was
[52:19] praying and said Lord will some way get
[52:21] the message out to not what I preach but
[52:24] what the prophet of God has brought us
[52:26] right and the fivefold ministry has been
[52:29] used to be able to put it together to
[52:32] help us and you know to do and and he
[52:35] told me one day he said well you got
[52:37] your request because of the internet
[52:40] system that's going around the world you
[52:42] know so I appreciate that that's I
[52:44] really do amen and I'm not the final
[52:47] Authority in this message we will as I
[52:49] said probably next week begin a few
[52:52] services on doctrines because we have a
[52:55] lot of new ones here
[52:57] you know not heard maybe or maybe heard
[52:59] something out there and maybe a lot of
[53:02] times people have heard things out there
[53:05] they thought they agreed with right we
[53:07] were riding down the road talking to
[53:08] certain people one day and U I said
[53:11] something and the sister turned around
[53:13] to her husband and said is that what we
[53:16] believe he said nope that ain't what we
[53:18] believe we was wrong you know but that's
[53:22] all right that was you know and you know
[53:25] it's it's no problem being to be wrong
[53:28] is problem in staying wrong but truth we
[53:30] were talking last night in the Bible
[53:32] study about it you know
[53:35] that you could actually have made fun of
[53:37] somebody or done something like that and
[53:40] and and it not be that God count that as
[53:43] blaspheming right because of the honest
[53:45] of your heart right look at Paul causing
[53:48] people to blaspheme that's right but yet
[53:51] I don't believe he was he was sincere he
[53:54] thought he was right and you know what
[53:56] what he was up to where he was y right
[54:02] because the law was the law he was with
[54:04] it he would stand with it but then see
[54:06] he I don't believe he ever made light
[54:10] the wrong way right he just done things
[54:13] wrong and God forgave him from doing
[54:15] that and he was even killing the
[54:17] Christians and things so then it's all
[54:19] into God you know and we were talking
[54:20] about that last night all right but what
[54:22] we want to do this afternoon is just
[54:24] take a few uh questions and comments and
[54:28] just talk a little about
[54:30] the what we've been saying and then to
[54:33] lay it down to where that someone could
[54:36] out there listen and say well okay after
[54:39] after 18 sermons I finally know what he
[54:42] said cuz I'd rather do it that way you
[54:44] know and that was kind of the last two
[54:46] or three messages we've had because of
[54:49] company and different things that we we
[54:51] changed a little way of just you know
[54:54] bringing things out and I I like to do
[54:56] it that way I don't like to just be
[54:58] because there's no need of it just put
[55:00] out what you believe and put it out in a
[55:02] heart of love and Let It Go all right
[55:05] right and and and follow on in the Lord
[55:08] but I hope you've been following me what
[55:11] I've been saying about there's no one
[55:13] can be perfect right but yet the prophet
[55:16] of God said ever born again Christian I
[55:18] gave you that quote ever born again
[55:21] Christian right is perfectly totally
[55:25] sinless in the sight of God right now
[55:28] that's a wonderful position can we
[55:31] realize our Perfection doesn't come
[55:32] through ourselves it doesn't come upon
[55:36] what you know uh how much we know of the
[55:39] message that's right it comes upon how
[55:42] much of the message has been revealed
[55:44] personally to us right see there's where
[55:47] our Perfection lies is in Jesus Christ
[55:50] see in the eyes of man nobody can be
[55:54] perfect but in God eyes if we can see
[55:58] that we are in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[56:01] was perfect all right see then we don't
[56:04] have to kind of figure out that you you
[56:06] don't do this and you don't do that and
[56:08] you don't uh you know practice sin well
[56:11] we know that a true Christian is not
[56:13] supposed to practice sin that's that's
[56:15] the point we know that for certainty
[56:18] because you can't credit sin to God
[56:21] himself all right if God is in us living
[56:24] in the soul right amen now I've tried to
[56:27] make that you know blunt and plain
[56:29] living in our soul our soul then by the
[56:33] new birth is perfect all right not
[56:37] complete even the prophet would say he
[56:38] said because you only have the earnest
[56:40] of your new birth and things it's just
[56:43] an Earnest but the new birth you receive
[56:45] all right the pyramid shows us that cuz
[56:47] then we grow in Grace and knowledge up
[56:49] through and coming out to the right
[56:51] place to see you know Christ Living in
[56:54] US Amen in his name nature and and in
[56:57] doing that then we realize that we have
[57:01] problem out here in the body and spirit
[57:03] right a true born again Christian I've
[57:05] tried to tell you cannot Sin from their
[57:08] soul right all right it's not the soul
[57:10] that sins right it's the body and spirit
[57:13] amen all right it is the one that is
[57:16] caught in the problems of life and doing
[57:18] wrong and never things see then you
[57:21] might say well now how can you sin with
[57:23] your body and spirit without it being
[57:25] your soul right well as I said to you I
[57:27] surely hope that you're not going to say
[57:29] to me that you Sin from your soul if
[57:32] you're a born again Christian right now
[57:35] that would put us in a bad category and
[57:38] that surely would make salvation a lost
[57:41] thing right but I tried to explain that
[57:43] to you over and over that we're under
[57:45] the blood of Jesus Christ and if under
[57:48] the blood of bulls and goats sin would
[57:50] be covered there in the Old Testament
[57:53] how much more under the blood of Jesus
[57:55] Christ
[57:56] which would not only just be the blood
[57:58] it's over the whole world right amen the
[58:01] whole world is covered by the bumper
[58:03] blood of Jesus Christ that's right and
[58:06] sin is not being you know setting up
[58:09] there I get no no he don't have to wait
[58:13] around and do things like that he has a
[58:16] record that he can do and keep up with
[58:19] yes right and we must keep that record
[58:21] clean all right and I believe as a
[58:24] Christian and taught you that
[58:27] that the prophet said we sin a sin as a
[58:29] Christian we'll reap a tub for that's
[58:30] right am and he said Christians are the
[58:32] only ones who have sins plal a sinner is
[58:36] condemned on a higher level he's just a
[58:38] sinner it doesn't matter all right you
[58:41] don't have to stand up there and say did
[58:43] you do so and so yeah did you do so and
[58:45] so yeah did well well I guess it's
[58:47] enough against you to kill you no he
[58:50] won't have to do that no right it won't
[58:52] be on that basis but around said you'll
[58:55] just turn your head walk away that's
[58:57] right thank you
[58:59] J about that see but yet the Bible says
[59:02] that there are religious people that
[59:03] have come up and say have not I cast out
[59:06] devils and done Mighty Merit things in
[59:08] thy name and he said depart from me I
[59:10] never knew you he never had a personal
[59:13] experience of
[59:14] Salvation they never were born again but
[59:17] they were anointed ones Christian is
[59:19] what we would call anointed realm yep
[59:22] good people and the world is full of
[59:24] those people and God will deal with
[59:26] those people later right but we as the
[59:29] body of Jesus Christ already have
[59:31] eternal life in the
[59:32] soul and working upon this body and
[59:35] spirit to bring it under subjection
[59:38] right you know to the one we were kind
[59:40] of discussing some of this last night
[59:42] really had a wonderful time in enjoying
[59:44] it and talking about if somebody goes
[59:47] out and does something wrong and you
[59:50] commit them you know or you do whatever
[59:51] you got to do and and all the things you
[59:53] would have to do and how you would pray
[59:56] for a person up to a certain point and
[59:58] then you would stop praying for them you
[1:00:00] said well brother D there's no way I
[1:00:02] could ever stop praying for my
[1:00:05] children that might be what's wrong
[1:00:07] that's
[1:00:08] right exactly right amen now we explain
[1:00:12] that last night it most tell you
[1:00:13] wouldn't
[1:00:14] there we explained that the best we
[1:00:18] could if a child or somebody if I
[1:00:20] committed wait over to the to the Lord
[1:00:23] because he was doing wrong it wouldn't
[1:00:24] straighten up right then I'm not going
[1:00:26] to pray for him anymore
[1:00:28] n I'm commanded not to brother R said I
[1:00:32] don't want to pray for somebody that I
[1:00:35] don't know he said because if I pray and
[1:00:39] cast that off he said I will get in
[1:00:43] trouble with the Lord amen now that's
[1:00:46] his words he said I want to know if it's
[1:00:48] there for a reason see if know like I
[1:00:51] said if I committed way we did we go
[1:00:53] through the channels you pray for him up
[1:00:55] to the point that we say you got 30 days
[1:00:57] after 30 days you don't straighten up
[1:00:59] you quit praying for
[1:01:01] it yeah but that's just that's mean mean
[1:01:04] to what I'm want to save him right
[1:01:06] that's it if I keep glorying in him
[1:01:08] that's what Paul said about the man in
[1:01:10] the Corinthians right he said you're sit
[1:01:12] here glory in other words you're you're
[1:01:13] not arguing with you're not condemning
[1:01:15] the man because he's living with his
[1:01:17] father's wife yeah you
[1:01:19] know he said you're not doing that he
[1:01:22] said well when you get together and do
[1:01:24] something about it that's right well you
[1:01:26] know what they got together and done
[1:01:27] something about it brother Brown said
[1:01:29] second Corinthians a man wound up being
[1:01:31] a good deacon now that's his words but
[1:01:33] where would he have been if it kept home
[1:01:35] and hadn't got together and committed to
[1:01:37] the Lord that's right now we know that
[1:01:39] we don't commit people to the
[1:01:41] devil no that's what we used to think
[1:01:44] that's what people think you know we're
[1:01:46] just turn him over to the devil you
[1:01:47] can't do that no you brother around
[1:01:50] explained that right yep he said you
[1:01:53] commit them to God yep he he will commit
[1:01:56] him to the devil right but like I said
[1:01:58] what if we here at the church and we're
[1:02:00] praying for Wade you know and he's out
[1:02:03] doing wrong and and we're here and we're
[1:02:06] praying Lord we just turn him loose to
[1:02:08] the devil send the devil after him and
[1:02:11] he's over there praying and saying God
[1:02:13] forgive
[1:02:14] me and you're in trouble y but if we
[1:02:17] commit we're here and we commit him to
[1:02:19] God God's on the other end don't worry
[1:02:21] about it just right now right but that's
[1:02:23] just thing we discussed it
[1:02:26] might interest some of you to come and
[1:02:29] we just have common questions and
[1:02:30] answers what I call it is whatever comes
[1:02:32] off the floor right but see I hope you
[1:02:35] understand what I'm trying to get at
[1:02:37] under the blood of Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ This World out here God is Not
[1:02:43] Looking Down with envious hateful
[1:02:47] eyes he knows that's right and he's
[1:02:51] waiting yes but you know what when the
[1:02:53] bride goes up in the Rapture yes sir the
[1:02:56] blood leaves right there is no blood
[1:02:59] Covenant when the bride leaves in the
[1:03:01] Rapture that's right so then your people
[1:03:04] are not going to be that you think that
[1:03:06] you're praying so much for them now and
[1:03:08] don't want to commit them to the
[1:03:09] Lord there's not going to be any blood
[1:03:12] then no that's right what kind of a
[1:03:14] situation you want them in that's right
[1:03:16] the Bible says that the animals leap
[1:03:18] right off of your body while you're
[1:03:20] standing here right said you'll cry for
[1:03:23] the rocks to fall on you and hide you
[1:03:26] you can't even die amen now that' be
[1:03:28] horrible wouldn't it yes see we're
[1:03:30] trying to save people not it sound like
[1:03:33] see when you first hear about us and
[1:03:35] then you you you wonder what what kind
[1:03:38] of people we are and then somebody comes
[1:03:41] along and says oh them people down just
[1:03:42] believe just believe in committing
[1:03:44] people to the to the
[1:03:45] devil see you tell them no that's wrong
[1:03:48] we believe in committing them to God
[1:03:50] right amen you
[1:03:52] know and then we could let let God take
[1:03:55] care of that's right
[1:03:56] right but see then getting back to the
[1:03:58] story where we get on see then that
[1:04:01] bumper blood is covering but one day
[1:04:03] that bumper of blood will be gone right
[1:04:06] now God is keeping records yes that's
[1:04:10] right because there are records we
[1:04:11] explain that that as I said the prophet
[1:04:14] said you sin a sin as a
[1:04:16] Christian you're going to rip a t full
[1:04:18] from it am yeah but youve told us that
[1:04:21] we couldn't sin you can't Sin from the
[1:04:24] soul right right that soul that is born
[1:04:28] again now not just because you're
[1:04:30] anointed not because you go to church
[1:04:32] not because you believe the message if
[1:04:35] you are truly Born Again
[1:04:37] amen that Soul can never sin again right
[1:04:42] you sin with your body spirit and soul
[1:04:44] if you're lost right because you're a
[1:04:46] product of sin when you're born again
[1:04:48] your soul can't
[1:04:50] sin all right got a question cut on the
[1:04:53] line of
[1:04:54] that but
[1:04:56] get to point that you can't sin is it
[1:04:58] that Soul can't sin why cuz John said
[1:05:01] his seed remained you the seed of God
[1:05:04] can't sin amen because the seed of God
[1:05:06] is a revealed word that's right so he
[1:05:08] can't account sin to God that's right so
[1:05:11] God living in us that's how we're
[1:05:12] perfect that's right right I mean we we
[1:05:15] went over that over that over and you
[1:05:17] said well I've heard it so many times
[1:05:20] well did you finally get it
[1:05:23] right at least you know what I believe
[1:05:26] right all right but now let's just get
[1:05:29] down cuz I'm cover most time I speak for
[1:05:32] quite a while and then I have comments
[1:05:34] and all but I've got one here that that
[1:05:37] I hope that the person that turned it in
[1:05:39] don't mind us just reading the comments
[1:05:42] you know the whole thing we'll get to
[1:05:44] that in a minute but we got a couple of
[1:05:46] comment
[1:05:48] questions that I want to cover first all
[1:05:51] right because then we'll take comments
[1:05:52] and things and then when we finish we'll
[1:05:55] try to to read some things all
[1:06:00] right this is kind of like a question
[1:06:02] that I know that Paul said I Die
[1:06:06] daily and brother rown said you're going
[1:06:09] to be sticky and have a carnal nature
[1:06:12] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:06:14] you live okay now those are correct
[1:06:18] right right amen the prophet said it the
[1:06:21] Bible says it now I like this part but
[1:06:24] do we ever reach a point before our body
[1:06:30] change where we can say that we truly
[1:06:33] are dead to
[1:06:35] ourselves and not have to Die
[1:06:39] daily all right
[1:06:42] now I stay with the prophet of what he
[1:06:45] said and now listen to the
[1:06:47] point I believe we're going to be a
[1:06:49] sticker because we're going to be human
[1:06:51] right until the change of the body all
[1:06:54] right we're going to have problems as
[1:06:57] human life yes that's a normal thing and
[1:07:00] it it will be with us all of our life
[1:07:02] yes I never taught you that that you'll
[1:07:05] come to a place that you just won't
[1:07:07] never do wrong right I don't believe
[1:07:10] brother Ram ever taught that I don't
[1:07:11] believe the Bible teaches right no or
[1:07:13] Paul would said I Die daily right all
[1:07:16] right but I do
[1:07:18] believe that the longer we are in
[1:07:23] Christ it might not be that we overcome
[1:07:26] to the point to not have problems
[1:07:29] because that would have to that would
[1:07:32] take a whole sermon in itself to define
[1:07:35] the thing right it's not wrong to be
[1:07:39] tempted Jesus was tempted that's right
[1:07:42] the Bible said in all points as we are
[1:07:45] yet without sin amen all right so what
[1:07:49] was the what's the difference in him you
[1:07:51] know what was it he didn't entertain
[1:07:53] that right
[1:07:55] it wasn't that it didn't come through
[1:07:57] right I mean he was out there 40
[1:08:00] days and you can't live like that
[1:08:02] there's no such thing in the Bible as a
[1:08:04] 40-day fast all right people say oh this
[1:08:08] that no brother R tells you to no such
[1:08:10] thing he said he never fasted over 3
[1:08:13] days in his life I know that's most
[1:08:15] people B the message will just about
[1:08:17] beat you to death about that well that's
[1:08:19] what he said all right now you believe
[1:08:22] him but now he might not ate nothing but
[1:08:24] one meal a day for months or years that
[1:08:28] he was fasting yeah but as far as a fast
[1:08:31] he said never over 3 days all right
[1:08:37] now if if it's true
[1:08:40] then I believe the closer we get to God
[1:08:43] through the revealed word the more truth
[1:08:45] we
[1:08:46] know amen all right like I said there
[1:08:49] the other night about it you don't have
[1:08:51] dreams you don't have wrong thoughts m
[1:08:56] right we do what do you think well what
[1:08:59] about a dream I bring that out because
[1:09:01] of our our connections and our
[1:09:04] Realms and things and you say well is
[1:09:07] that my
[1:09:08] soul well if it's born again it can't be
[1:09:12] wrong now if it's not then it's just
[1:09:16] everything
[1:09:17] else right well see then we got to learn
[1:09:20] the difference between what is sin right
[1:09:24] right all right and what is unbelief
[1:09:28] right well now I got to quote where
[1:09:30] brother R said all sin is unbelief amen
[1:09:33] I agree with you I've been through that
[1:09:36] I believe that right but I got the
[1:09:38] quotes where the Prophet said I sin
[1:09:40] every day so now you going to argue
[1:09:42] quotes yeah or you going to just sit
[1:09:45] down long enough to listen yes right no
[1:09:48] you won't do it you going do what you
[1:09:50] want to do
[1:09:51] anyway cuz you're not going to change
[1:09:53] you know it takes God to change people's
[1:09:56] ideas said right here hear it said every
[1:09:59] day and still not believe
[1:10:02] it right that's right y cuz you know
[1:10:06] what you know I'm up here talking you
[1:10:08] out there trying to figure out what
[1:10:09] we're going to have for
[1:10:12] supper where we going when to get
[1:10:17] through I didn't like what he say and
[1:10:20] you know what it just totally
[1:10:21] annihilates everything it said right and
[1:10:24] really you don't hear right
[1:10:29] right right right so then we ought to
[1:10:32] listen amen that's why I encourage you
[1:10:34] right why we have the tastes right you
[1:10:36] don't understand something I say like
[1:10:39] I've always said get the tape that
[1:10:42] person come to me one time said Brother
[1:10:43] D you said so to I no I
[1:10:45] didn't yes you did I heard
[1:10:48] you solve the problem we'll get the
[1:10:52] T we'll play the T if if I said it I'll
[1:10:56] be glad to apologize
[1:10:59] right but I know I didn't say it right
[1:11:02] so let's go get to take solve the
[1:11:05] problem they didn't want to get to take
[1:11:07] face it because they knew if I was were
[1:11:10] willing to put it on the line and I
[1:11:12] figured I must not have done it right
[1:11:14] all right but listen
[1:11:17] Church
[1:11:19] sin sure it's to disbelieve God's word
[1:11:24] right all right right and you say well
[1:11:26] really what we do is we disbelieve God's
[1:11:28] word it it's not that we disbelieve
[1:11:31] God's
[1:11:35] word it's not to happen
[1:11:37] right it it's not to say we disbelieve
[1:11:41] did Jesus
[1:11:42] disbelieve when he was tempted
[1:11:46] no did brother brandham disbelieve when
[1:11:49] he was
[1:11:52] tempted so it's not dis believing to be
[1:11:54] tempted have thoughts and to do wrong
[1:11:57] right it's sin when we try to justify
[1:12:01] that right amen you agree right when we
[1:12:06] try to justify we try to say that I
[1:12:08] really didn't do it or this that or the
[1:12:10] other about then we make it into sin
[1:12:13] like I told you about the children of
[1:12:16] Israel 10
[1:12:18] times from crossing the you know coming
[1:12:22] out of Egypt right to Cades Baria they
[1:12:25] sinned 10 times and God was still taking
[1:12:29] them to the promised
[1:12:30] land but when they refused to believe
[1:12:33] what Joshua and Caleb said about the
[1:12:36] promised land amen they went to the
[1:12:39] Wilderness and never went to the
[1:12:40] promised land amen it became
[1:12:45] unbelief the other was Natural Things
[1:12:48] life sin we're hungry we're
[1:12:52] thirsty he brought us out here to kill
[1:12:54] us you know yeah but when they got to
[1:12:57] the point that they said we don't
[1:12:59] believe we can go into the promised land
[1:13:02] that was unbelief amen I tried to
[1:13:05] explain to you you know where the Bible
[1:13:07] said that lust when is conceived brings
[1:13:09] forth Sin Sin when it's finished brings
[1:13:13] death amen that's right see
[1:13:16] lust right it's not wrong to have a
[1:13:18] wrong thought right a wrong desire but
[1:13:22] if we entertain that yeah until it
[1:13:26] becomes a part of us that's it right see
[1:13:30] where it would be with me one thing
[1:13:31] might be brother Mark another way
[1:13:33] brother Donnie another way it's never
[1:13:35] the same with all of
[1:13:38] us and something that that I would tell
[1:13:40] you that bothers me you would life like
[1:13:43] everything but you know what you tell me
[1:13:45] that bothered you i' life right right
[1:13:49] because we're all different that's true
[1:13:51] and we're dealt with different amen but
[1:13:53] then that establish tried to through the
[1:13:55] series of
[1:13:58] sin and what it
[1:14:01] was if it finally comes down that we
[1:14:04] disbelieve this
[1:14:08] message we disbel something brother
[1:14:10] around say
[1:14:12] it
[1:14:14] or we know it's right and won't do it
[1:14:16] now that's iniquity right and that's
[1:14:19] that's iniquity iniquity is to know to
[1:14:22] do good and won't do it am that is sin
[1:14:26] that is disbelieving God's word right to
[1:14:30] see something and refuse to do it
[1:14:31] because of some reason it would cost me
[1:14:34] too much it would mean this it would
[1:14:36] mean that yeah if I if I took my stand
[1:14:39] upon that word
[1:14:41] well you can get out into unbelief right
[1:14:44] there right so I hope you can understand
[1:14:47] that part of it to where that I can make
[1:14:49] this statement about
[1:14:51] it about the questioning enough will it
[1:14:54] ever come to worth we we won't be yield
[1:14:56] into the body I believe through the
[1:14:58] opening of the word we find out I hope
[1:15:02] through the series that I've been in
[1:15:05] that at least some of you have found out
[1:15:07] y right that what you thought was
[1:15:11] sinning right y you know
[1:15:15] wrong and we're not talking about going
[1:15:17] out and do it wrong we're talking about
[1:15:18] just life and condemnation of
[1:15:22] life you know cuz see lot of people
[1:15:25] preaching against man and wife being
[1:15:28] husband and wife yep you know what I
[1:15:31] mean by they preach against
[1:15:33] it that's sin that's part of the garden
[1:15:37] that's not
[1:15:39] sin I just wonder what they think amen
[1:15:42] if you say okay let's erase it
[1:15:46] back to where your Mother and Daddy
[1:15:48] brought you
[1:15:50] yeah you get what I'm saying let's take
[1:15:54] it back to Where Your Mother and Daddy
[1:15:56] lustfully brought
[1:15:59] you see people don't want to talk like
[1:16:01] that to
[1:16:03] me right but you see yeah I believe the
[1:16:07] closer we get in the word it'll be
[1:16:09] revealed to us the more of life that is
[1:16:13] normal thing right amen
[1:16:15] amen that's
[1:16:17] right normal things that's
[1:16:21] right I've heard people preach if you
[1:16:23] wore two tones you shoes is going to
[1:16:32] hell heard people preach that it was a
[1:16:36] sin to K send your kids to school and to
[1:16:40] get an education cuz education was of
[1:16:42] the devil
[1:16:44] yeah and they took their kids out of
[1:16:48] school all right sure did see that's why
[1:16:50] people don't like me cuz I can't help it
[1:16:52] my memory works
[1:16:55] and that's just like doctrines I want
[1:16:57] you to understand some things and just
[1:16:59] think about
[1:17:01] them you know that brother randam told
[1:17:03] Billy
[1:17:05] Paul when that boom was going to go off
[1:17:08] and he didn't know what it was he had
[1:17:10] the dream and all he said ain't no human
[1:17:12] could stand
[1:17:13] it he said get Joseph and put him in
[1:17:17] make sure he gets an education yeah and
[1:17:21] you know that none of their
[1:17:23] kids they quit
[1:17:28] school would you mind
[1:17:32] explaining some of those things right
[1:17:35] amen all right M you know that Billy
[1:17:38] Paul after brother Brandon was out on
[1:17:40] the field been on it a long time Billy
[1:17:43] and as much as he said about going to
[1:17:45] college y Billy Paul went
[1:17:48] to a Christian Bible
[1:17:53] College that's right GRE that's where he
[1:17:55] met brother PR green
[1:17:58] was and you know that they told a story
[1:18:01] that that they was fixing to say
[1:18:03] something about brother Bill Paul PR did
[1:18:06] and the phone rain they was fixing to
[1:18:08] say something in some way the phone
[1:18:12] rain and brother randam was on the other
[1:18:14] end want to speak to the professor
[1:18:16] orever who it
[1:18:18] was in just a few minutes everything got
[1:18:21] changed
[1:18:25] see you can't you say but but it's wrong
[1:18:28] that see like I said I've heard it
[1:18:31] that's
[1:18:33] right I've heard it preached that the
[1:18:36] women I mean read quoted stated that
[1:18:39] women will be saved and
[1:18:42] childbearing well what if a woman can't
[1:18:43] have a child yeah that's what I asked
[1:18:46] one brother right they would preaching
[1:18:49] it yep I said what if you can't have a
[1:18:52] child
[1:18:57] see what I'm saying is I'm trying to
[1:18:58] answer the question and the point of
[1:19:00] what I'm getting
[1:19:02] down the more we come to God the closer
[1:19:05] we come we're still going to be stickers
[1:19:07] right the prophet said it until we
[1:19:09] changed amen but I believe that the
[1:19:12] stickers is going to get less
[1:19:15] right right now don't don't tell me you
[1:19:17] running around with men or women and
[1:19:19] then you no we ain't talking about that
[1:19:21] class forget it we're not we're not
[1:19:24] garbage in if you got that problem then
[1:19:27] you're lost right period blunt
[1:19:31] right man I'm going to go ahead and say
[1:19:34] something I said last
[1:19:35] night I've been able to for a long time
[1:19:39] anyway you know a lot of people knows a
[1:19:41] whole lot more about what goes on in
[1:19:42] this church than I do that's right you
[1:19:45] know why cuz I don't get out and meddle
[1:19:47] in everybody's
[1:19:49] business right that's right I only hear
[1:19:52] what you tell me right I don't mail you

[1:19:58] phone do you hear right you he right

[1:20:20] leave it in the morning now Ain got
[1:20:23] something no you can't do that okay but
[1:20:25] get it right here's my point if you know
[1:20:29] something in this church and this is to
[1:20:32] everybody that goes to this
[1:20:33] church whether you're here today you're
[1:20:36] at later or what if you know something's

[1:20:44] deacons and let them come to me right
[1:20:48] then the sin is on you right I've been
[1:20:52] able to say that a long time because I
[1:20:53] know I know a lot of people around here

[1:22:16] believe that the more we learn about the
[1:22:17] word of God right right the less his
[1:22:20] flesh will control us
[1:22:22] right that's right
[1:22:26] there was a
[1:22:27] time I know a lot of you were Christians
[1:22:31] they were smoking
[1:22:32] right they used to be in church you know
[1:22:35] going somewhere I talk about the
[1:22:36] messaging or something talk about you're
[1:22:40] smoking well you know that was a bad
[1:22:44] problem for
[1:22:45] you but you know I never had a problem
[1:22:47] with
[1:22:49] it and what I mean I didn't problem with
[1:22:52] that you doing it here
[1:22:55] well you're sure a strange preacher no I
[1:22:57] believe in Salvation I don't believe in
[1:23:01] disgrace I believe in Deliverance Sister
[1:23:04] Hazel F bush used to play the piano she
[1:23:07] played the piano when she was
[1:23:12] smoking and I have no problem with
[1:23:17] it well I just beat her to death she
[1:23:19] ain't been on my pull pit bless God you

[1:23:32] way but you was out there and you were
[1:23:34] smoking cigarettes and you know what
[1:23:36] before you come around the message you
[1:23:38] maybe didn't know that was wrong
[1:23:40] right cuz everybody in the church where
[1:23:43] you was at was doing it well the opening
[1:23:47] of the word see the the coming into
[1:23:49] contact with the word right brought an
[1:23:52] opening that you could deal with your
[1:23:54] life right yep little things that we
[1:23:57] think in our
[1:23:58] lives the the opening of the word can
[1:24:01] bring that to a situation to where it
[1:24:02] can be dealt with right amen that's
[1:24:05] right right right to where we can get
[1:24:07] rid of it that's right that way it's not
[1:24:09] brother Dale preaching on the ever
[1:24:11] service show me where that's ever saved
[1:24:15] anybody now I'm I'm open that's
[1:24:19] right said we bless God ain't nobody in
[1:24:22] our church that's smoking we
[1:24:25] you might all check around sniff a
[1:24:26] little
[1:24:28] bit you might find out there's some
[1:24:33] wrong but you see you getting the point
[1:24:36] what I'm saying yes the closer we get to
[1:24:40] God I believe we will learn that we as
[1:24:44] human beings are Mortals that's right
[1:24:48] right and we'll do wrong amen and we'll
[1:24:51] be tempted amen right but we'll find
[1:24:54] find out how to control that right
[1:24:57] amen you know find out how to deal with
[1:25:00] it
[1:25:02] amen right right right we won't we won't
[1:25:07] put it to the basis that that we're
[1:25:09] willingly ignorant right you know we'll
[1:25:12] put it to the basis and we'll try to
[1:25:14] deal with it
[1:25:17] right that's the way brother Dale I
[1:25:19] believe in Deliverance amen yes sir if
[1:25:22] you quit smoking because brother Dale
[1:25:23] says it's right wrong to smoke you got a
[1:25:26] problem with a demon that's going to
[1:25:28] really torment you to death right right
[1:25:31] that's right like brother R said to that
[1:25:33] who was the name Bill or something like
[1:25:35] that and he he was out there and he was
[1:25:36] hunting and he
[1:25:38] said he went out you know he went off
[1:25:40] tied the horses up and he smoke and he
[1:25:42] come back and and when he come back
[1:25:44] around brother R called his name you
[1:25:46] know like Bill he said yeah he said when
[1:25:48] did you quit smoking he said just
[1:25:52] now he said just now now well was that
[1:25:56] which was the worst to beat him to death
[1:25:59] you had never heard him talking about
[1:26:00] hunting with a lizard eyed looking guy
[1:26:04] Bert
[1:26:05] Y and you know all of brother brandom's
[1:26:08] gifts never converted Bert no now you
[1:26:11] know while they was out there together
[1:26:12] that God dealt with brother brandom and
[1:26:14] you know he talked about the Lord sure
[1:26:17] right but you know that mother deer that
[1:26:19] had that
[1:26:20] nature brought birth to his knees
[1:26:26] not different amen you understand what
[1:26:29] I'm saying I believe the more we get
[1:26:31] into the word right the more the word is
[1:26:33] going to take away the things sure we'll
[1:26:36] still be stickers you'll never punch me
[1:26:39] that I won't say
[1:26:41] ouch but it might be that I learn a lot
[1:26:44] by it you know to get worded I don't
[1:26:46] ouch as much he used to work with a guy
[1:26:50] and he you know that people would punch
[1:26:53] him and he hit the guy next to
[1:26:55] you and one day somebody punched him he
[1:26:59] hit me and I waited while where's that
[1:27:00] and I said now
[1:27:01] Mitchell I want you to know that I'm not
[1:27:04] as dumb as you think I
[1:27:06] am you hting these people not all that

[1:27:15] that kind of person well it wouldn't
[1:27:17] long somebody come up behind him and
[1:27:18] punched him he drove back like that he
[1:27:20] he's fixing to hit me when he did he
[1:27:22] went I said see there you can help
[1:27:25] so this no food around me see we're
[1:27:28] human that's right but learning about a
[1:27:32] human that's what caught me with brother
[1:27:34] brand brother BR was so honest and so
[1:27:37] straight he wanted to smoke he wanted to
[1:27:42] drink
[1:27:44] right but God kept him from it and he
[1:27:46] wasn't a Christian
[1:27:49] right he was protecting the gift right
[1:27:52] amen of the man
[1:27:55] right yet he would tell it yeah and then
[1:27:57] I read the Bible about Abraham and I
[1:27:59] knew how the Jews were run around one
[1:28:01] day come along look at said do you think
[1:28:03] them stun Jews would write that about
[1:28:07] Abraham right no they W know that in
[1:28:10] their
[1:28:11] record he said but God made him right
[1:28:15] right he see we will be stickers
[1:28:19] right until it comes to the basis that
[1:28:22] we can just keep walking away from our
[1:28:23] stick
[1:28:24] right until it gets where it won't hurt
[1:28:28] right but we'll be human until the
[1:28:30] change come amen that's right and when
[1:28:32] that change comes the brother R said
[1:28:34] something about you know your jobs won't
[1:28:36] be important
[1:28:38] then but did he
[1:28:40] say you'll quit your
[1:28:42] jobs they didn't say that right he said
[1:28:46] if you knew what you had in your pocket
[1:28:48] you would take it out in the street and
[1:28:50] burn
[1:28:52] it he never did burn the money he had in
[1:28:55] his pocket right
[1:28:58] right but he told us what it was right
[1:29:02] it's the dirtiest things see Don them
[1:29:05] gloves on Ain that something gloves on
[1:29:07] count
[1:29:08] money just give to me I'll take care of
[1:29:11] it all the dirty stuff me I'll give it
[1:29:14] to the teller she can put blood
[1:29:16] on but see we'll be human until the
[1:29:21] change right amen that's right
[1:29:25] maybe in that 30 40 days when we see the
[1:29:26] dead among us we might be a whole lot
[1:29:28] more sensitive about our lives and
[1:29:30] things right because we're supposed to
[1:29:32] be here that long you know right right
[1:29:35] but until then it will be
[1:29:38] stickers the new birth never took away
[1:29:40] from Brother ROM the love to hunt
[1:29:43] right right
[1:29:46] right you may love to be model
[1:29:49] cars the new birth is not going to take
[1:29:51] that away from you right no aild in
[1:29:54] model cars
[1:29:56] right we were all life in cuz ter and
[1:29:59] them still got the old uh what was that
[1:30:01] record player thing the big old thing
[1:30:03] that we bought when we first got men the
[1:30:05] wife when way come along about 1960 we
[1:30:08] bought this thing and to get to buy it
[1:30:10] we was allowed to get $25 worth of toys
[1:30:13] Well w was one or two years about a
[1:30:16] little over a year old and so of course
[1:30:18] Wade wanted a a train a car set you know
[1:30:22] that's what he wanted because I was the
[1:30:24] one that told him what he wanted so I
[1:30:27] went in and got the car and I took it
[1:30:29] home and I put it together and I said
[1:30:31] get him out of here he's turn up the
[1:30:36] car that's right just human anything
[1:30:39] wrong with being human
[1:30:43] no a lot of said about brother random in
[1:30:45] his
[1:30:46] ways but that's one thing it caught
[1:30:49] me was a
[1:30:52] man that would tell
[1:30:55] y that when he asked his wife kind of
[1:30:58] like tell them that I'm not here you
[1:31:01] know he wouldn't he went out the back
[1:31:02] door the income tax case and God
[1:31:05] condemned
[1:31:07] him and you know he went down to pray
[1:31:09] for a baby and God wouldn't hear it
[1:31:11] that's right he went back and
[1:31:12] straightened
[1:31:15] up he went back and straightened up he
[1:31:17] went back said give me the baby now
[1:31:19] right see right around was a human yes
[1:31:24] brother called me the other day
[1:31:25] apologized to me for something he
[1:31:27] preached here I said brother I think
[1:31:29] more of you than I ever
[1:31:33] have I said because you'd be honest
[1:31:35] enough to say you was wrong right that's
[1:31:39] right see because that should be the
[1:31:41] Life of Christ in all of us amen that's
[1:31:44] right not beating and hammering on
[1:31:46] people I'm just getting down to that I
[1:31:47] ain't no
[1:31:48] com but that was the point say we truly
[1:31:52] can we become dead to ourselves brother
[1:31:53] right said you can live so close to God
[1:31:55] Satan don't know what to do with you now
[1:31:57] somebody's going to have to do that
[1:32:00] right but you know what if you find out
[1:32:03] that the things you are doing as a human
[1:32:05] being is not sin Satan is losing his
[1:32:08] hold that's
[1:32:12] right see people preaches sin to eat too
[1:32:15] much well is a sin not to eat
[1:32:17] enough
[1:32:19] right right I mean if I way you go count
[1:32:26] I like brother Mo's idea of it was you
[1:32:28] can only fill up a 55 gon drum or a 50
[1:32:31] or a 3/4 in water pipe it's going to run
[1:32:33] out that's what it's doing it's running
[1:32:35] out on all of
[1:32:37] us maybe that's part of the stickiness
[1:32:39] we need to get rid of but you understand
[1:32:41] what I'm saying right the best answer I
[1:32:44] can say is right you know one day the
[1:32:47] closer we find more than way we find out
[1:32:49] that things are not
[1:32:51] wrong of our natural life right
[1:32:54] that's right then we can become free in
[1:32:56] God said You shall know the truth and
[1:32:58] the truth shall set you free that's
[1:33:00] right but you say Well it don't bother
[1:33:02] me all of the things I do now I didn't
[1:33:04] say that do amen I said the things of
[1:33:07] natural life right you
[1:33:09] know the things we condemned ourselves
[1:33:12] with or maybe condemn
[1:33:14] others you
[1:33:16] know and uh I remember there was a lady
[1:33:20] used to come to church here and they had
[1:33:22] these kids you know and they they uh
[1:33:25] they kind of text you by colors you know
[1:33:27] the little kids anonym could tell you
[1:33:29] all about it you know and then school
[1:33:32] you can tell a lot about how kids do and
[1:33:34] they coloring and their doings and you
[1:33:36] know the picking of
[1:33:37] colors and if you pick black all the
[1:33:39] time then they got it you know their
[1:33:42] their thought is that you got a
[1:33:44] problem right you know you got troubles
[1:33:49] because you always picking black see
[1:33:51] then they start running all this
[1:33:52] psychological things you know and they
[1:33:54] find out a lot of times it's true you
[1:33:56] know something wrong but this lady was
[1:33:58] telling about this one kid you know and
[1:34:00] it
[1:34:01] said how come you they took it in to
[1:34:03] talk to us so we just want to know that
[1:34:05] how come it is that you always picking
[1:34:10] black you
[1:34:12] know the little kid said well that's the
[1:34:14] only color left that got to
[1:34:19] me one that's L of that okay let's get
[1:34:24] all right here are some
[1:34:27] comments another one and then we'll we
[1:34:29] open up kind
[1:34:30] of we know in Ezekiel 18:20 it says the
[1:34:34] soul that sinth it shall die and that's
[1:34:36] true right the soul that sinth shall die
[1:34:40] all right now that doesn't matter
[1:34:42] whether you are who you are or what you
[1:34:44] are the soul that sinth shall die right
[1:34:48] right all right
[1:34:51] now but then the point that goes on to
[1:34:54] say so sin is with the
[1:34:56] soul okay the spirit and the flesh
[1:35:00] displace sin's attributes said am I
[1:35:04] correct since we say sin is the unbelief
[1:35:06] of the Soul all right now I tried to
[1:35:09] explain it to the series of one
[1:35:11] point if you're born
[1:35:14] again you are a sinner by soul body and
[1:35:18] spirit until the day you become born
[1:35:21] again right amen all right the day
[1:35:23] you're born again your soul is not
[1:35:26] sinning
[1:35:28] anymore it's Eternal so you can't say
[1:35:31] God is sinning he said what your soul is
[1:35:33] your being yeah that's that's
[1:35:36] true that's why I love the prophet's
[1:35:38] message that when you're born again your
[1:35:40] soul is your theopen the Eternal God so
[1:35:43] you can't credit sin to him so then
[1:35:46] before you're born again Body Spirit and
[1:35:47] soul is sin right so the soul that sinth
[1:35:50] it shall
[1:35:51] die all right now soul that does not get
[1:35:55] corrected or goes on you know doesn't
[1:35:57] get born again one day will be
[1:35:59] annihilated true it will die right cuz
[1:36:02] only God can kill a soul there's nothing
[1:36:04] no way to to for Satan he can't do it
[1:36:08] and all right so then if I'm born again
[1:36:11] my soul becomes Eternal amen my body and
[1:36:14] my spirit is still in the the sinful
[1:36:17] condition of life so I'm not sinning
[1:36:20] from my
[1:36:22] soul right I'm out in my life living in
[1:36:26] my spirit and my
[1:36:28] body and my body it was used to doing
[1:36:32] things and my spirit was used to doing
[1:36:36] things right and just because you're
[1:36:39] born
[1:36:40] again see it don't take out all of that
[1:36:43] as we think amen that's
[1:36:46] right you said the day I got born again
[1:36:50] people told me you know the day I got
[1:36:52] born again I I didn't smoke no more we
[1:36:54] come find out about 6 months later when
[1:36:57] they got to that point you
[1:36:59] know
[1:37:01] but see the soul that
[1:37:04] sinth it shall die
[1:37:07] right and I taught you that what to be
[1:37:10] able to be born
[1:37:12] again your soul must die
[1:37:17] right let's put it more into the
[1:37:19] prophet's words the nature of your soul
[1:37:23] go not as your soul dies like dead you
[1:37:26] know like BL you're dead you're going to
[1:37:27] the Undertaker no no it's the nature or
[1:37:30] ways of that Soul amen is dead so the
[1:37:34] soul that sin us shall die
[1:37:37] right then you sin a sin is a Christian
[1:37:40] you're having to be sin with your body
[1:37:41] and your spirit amen that's right you
[1:37:44] can't be with your soul if you're born
[1:37:45] again God has done died right amen so
[1:37:49] the scriptures right the soul that sinth
[1:37:51] shall die amen so every soul has to die
[1:37:53] I see if I get that right how is it uh
[1:37:57] if you're lost you you die twice
[1:38:01] right if you're lost I hope I'm getting
[1:38:04] this in the right way you you di the
[1:38:07] natural death right all right then you
[1:38:09] would die the spiritual as you would
[1:38:12] call it or whatever at the judgment and
[1:38:15] be cut off and die that's that's a
[1:38:18] person that is not born again but you
[1:38:21] know a Christian only dies once that's
[1:38:24] right
[1:38:25] right and that's dying out to yourself
[1:38:28] right Amen to where you be born again he
[1:38:30] said yeah but they going to die go no
[1:38:33] Christians don't
[1:38:34] die right Sinners
[1:38:38] die you say yeah but we put him in the
[1:38:41] grave but he ain't
[1:38:43] dead he's still alive
[1:38:46] amen he ain't dead so if you're a sinner
[1:38:49] you die twice you're Christian you have
[1:38:51] to die one time amen that's right die to
[1:38:54] yourself so the Bible still right the
[1:38:56] soul that sinth it shall
[1:38:58] die and if it is my soul today that is
[1:39:02] sinning I'm dead I'm lost
[1:39:07] right when if my soul is sealed by the
[1:39:10] Eternal Word and born again right then
[1:39:13] the mistakes of life is in my body and
[1:39:15] my spirit
[1:39:17] amen and that's what we were talking
[1:39:19] about to start with we got to deal with
[1:39:21] that right we got bring that under
[1:39:24] subjection to the one that's within
[1:39:29] us and let him H away right and say Lord
[1:39:33] what Would You
[1:39:34] Do you ever done that upon a situation
[1:39:37] somebody upset with you or somebody
[1:39:39] something happening you having a problem
[1:39:41] uh anything you know working on a car
[1:39:45] building on something Have you ever
[1:39:46] stopped long enough to just say
[1:39:50] Lord if you was doing this
[1:39:53] what would you
[1:39:56] do right you know you'll find out all
[1:39:59] them pieces just go together you know
[1:40:02] like looking at a puzzle and to me
[1:40:04] Richard down there the other day he's
[1:40:05] got one on the table I guess he's got to
[1:40:07] finish I don't know but he had one out
[1:40:09] there and he he was doing them things
[1:40:12] and I I tried to put pieces together I
[1:40:14] said I'll take care of
[1:40:16] that I just got my pocket knife you know
[1:40:20] I don't fit them pieces
[1:40:23] that's not exactly the story where it's
[1:40:25] supposed to be but you know that's life
[1:40:28] right so everybody understand what I'm
[1:40:31] saying
[1:40:32] right if you're lost you sin when your
[1:40:34] body spirit and soul right amen if
[1:40:37] you're a Christian born again sealed by
[1:40:39] the Holy Spirit not just confessing
[1:40:42] Christianity because the nature of your
[1:40:44] soul is not dead and justification and
[1:40:47] it's really not totally dead at
[1:40:49] sanctification it takes a baptism of the
[1:40:51] Holy Ghost to burn out that old nature
[1:40:53] ways to kill it and that's how it dies
[1:40:56] amen so then my body as a body spirit
[1:40:59] and soul as a sinner you know before is
[1:41:02] converted all sin y from my soul but
[1:41:06] when I'm born again my body and my
[1:41:08] spirit is in a realm out here of life
[1:41:10] right that exist Y and there's not sin
[1:41:14] accounted to the soul blessed is the man
[1:41:16] to whom God will not impute sin why
[1:41:19] because he can't impute it no because
[1:41:22] you're born again amen then we took a
[1:41:25] couple of messages discussing the body
[1:41:28] and the spirit and even we're covered by
[1:41:31] the
[1:41:32] blood so God is not imputing but a
[1:41:35] record is kept as a
[1:41:37] Christian that we're going to give an
[1:41:39] the account of the Deeds Done in the
[1:41:40] body
[1:41:41] right and let me ask you a question
[1:41:46] seriously is it that God has to write
[1:41:49] these things down we said no it's his
[1:41:52] memory can do but is it really that or
[1:41:54] is it me and you right
[1:41:58] right I'm serious I'm H just asking you
[1:42:00] a
[1:42:01] question sister Gil is it that God
[1:42:05] is not liking what we do or is it that
[1:42:08] we don't like what we do right right but
[1:42:11] the god that's within us is saying that
[1:42:14] ain't right right it's not the god of
[1:42:16] Heaven having to come down and tell us
[1:42:19] it's the god in our lives he says that's
[1:42:22] not right right
[1:42:23] I didn't want to think
[1:42:25] that that's my brother that's my sister
[1:42:29] right
[1:42:30] amen and in that way I'm not looking
[1:42:32] down on everybody
[1:42:34] then and say oh they're not a
[1:42:37] Christian what does it matter they're
[1:42:40] human being right right human being my
[1:42:46] goodness well a little bit late getting
[1:42:48] started so okay I say my Lord is 24
[1:42:53] but who's got any comments questions off
[1:42:55] the floor I gave you this from their
[1:42:57] sister that that you can take home read
[1:42:59] if we have time we'll do it but anybody
[1:43:01] got any comments questions from the
[1:43:02] floor and you got the microphone who
[1:43:04] will be first something about what I've
[1:43:07] been preaching wait got it over here
[1:43:10] need turn yours
[1:43:12] off turn it off and raise this up okay
[1:43:16] okay
[1:43:21] anybody anybody got any comments ments
[1:43:23] about it any questions about what I
[1:43:26] said these were the two that I received
[1:43:29] written in
[1:43:35] so that was that was the question I got
[1:43:39] Ry
[1:43:40] okay
[1:43:43] anybody you mean I preached it that well
[1:43:46] that you
[1:43:46] think you know at least you understand
[1:43:49] what I'm talking about I hope
[1:43:55] what about
[1:43:58] it questions comments or anything cuz
[1:44:02] you know how I am I don't care you tell
[1:44:04] me right on the floor I don't agree with
[1:44:06] you just give me a
[1:44:08] change okay um I never used to
[1:44:11] understand how sin is unbelief and sin
[1:44:14] is not drinking smoking and all
[1:44:17] that um that Ezekiel 18 saying the soul
[1:44:22] that sinth it shall die it doesn't say
[1:44:26] the body and spirit that sinth no
[1:44:28] correct so sin
[1:44:31] is uh linked with the soul and that's
[1:44:35] why sin is unbelief I could now clearly
[1:44:37] see
[1:44:38] that cuz the soul will either believe or
[1:44:42] not believe so sinning is not drinking
[1:44:47] smoking it's really unbelievable
[1:44:54] if if we could establish one thing that
[1:44:57] sin is not drinking gambling smoking
[1:44:59] running around etc etc that's not sin
[1:45:02] let's get that established all right
[1:45:05] then the life we live is not
[1:45:07] sin right you're in a different category
[1:45:10] of the life that we're living of human
[1:45:12] beings and and doings you know right cuz
[1:45:16] the prophet didn't
[1:45:18] say that uh you know he didn't say that
[1:45:22] to have a wrong thought was sin
[1:45:25] amen because that's that's not it it's
[1:45:27] Satan tempt
[1:45:29] him see he had the ability to even tempt
[1:45:33] the Lord
[1:45:35] Jesus now the only way I can explain
[1:45:38] that is you say that's impossible well
[1:45:40] let the Bible said it happened but the
[1:45:42] only way I can express that is that God
[1:45:44] had to some way allow that to move into
[1:45:47] a
[1:45:48] place that it could actually be
[1:45:51] Temptation that's right
[1:45:53] because you say well he was Body Spirit
[1:45:55] and soul God and his body and his his
[1:45:58] spirit and his soul was eternal but his
[1:46:00] body wasn't when a body without the
[1:46:02] spirit is dead so that's nothing so then
[1:46:04] some way Satan was able to enter a real
[1:46:08] and temp the Lord Jesus well how much
[1:46:11] can he do to you and I amen and the main
[1:46:15] thing he's doing today is trying to
[1:46:18] condemn us that's right
[1:46:21] amen about our thinking about our living
[1:46:24] that's right right that's right about
[1:46:26] our doings a natural life that's right
[1:46:30] when those are natural life that's right
[1:46:32] cuz he can't get you on one thing he get
[1:46:34] you on another one
[1:46:35] right I mean it's always been that way
[1:46:39] that's right but brother said if he
[1:46:40] can't get you to drink or anything like
[1:46:43] that he said he'll just get you to
[1:46:45] smoking and he said he'll hold you with
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:54] then what is life like you're saying it
[1:46:57] does say that exactly the soul that's
[1:46:59] sin it doesn't say the body and spirit
[1:47:01] that sin exactly right doesn't say
[1:47:04] that but if you're born if you're not
[1:47:06] born again it's easy to understand your
[1:47:08] soul is the unbelieving part and your
[1:47:11] body and spirit is displaying that's
[1:47:13] right right but then when you become a
[1:47:16] Christian your soul is
[1:47:18] eternal and cannot do wrong that's right
[1:47:21] that's right so the desires the things
[1:47:23] are not dealing with the inner part of
[1:47:25] you that's right cuz see if you go back
[1:47:27] to what the prophet said the inner part
[1:47:29] of you the soul he said it's either
[1:47:32] Faith or doubt that's right now there's
[1:47:36] no gray areas it's either Faith or doubt
[1:47:39] it's either born again or not born again
[1:47:41] right that's why I even covered the
[1:47:44] point that even at justification
[1:47:47] sanctification that that soul is still
[1:47:49] in a sinful condition right
[1:47:53] but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:55] comes it burns out all of that that's
[1:47:57] within there so then you
[1:48:01] don't how you you have no more
[1:48:03] conscience of sin that's right now
[1:48:06] you're getting into the bases that you
[1:48:08] don't
[1:48:09] practice because you're not conscious of
[1:48:12] it right so then the word practice can
[1:48:14] be used if it's used in the correct
[1:48:16] order but not used to just say well I
[1:48:19] can do a little bit but I just don't
[1:48:21] practice it a whole lot
[1:48:23] I've been through all the years those
[1:48:25] words have been used yeah you know some
[1:48:27] of you have but just not using it to
[1:48:29] prop up anything using it to be straight
[1:48:32] amen the soul that sinth shall die amen
[1:48:36] so if that Soul dies and gets a new
[1:48:38] birth or the nature of it so when you
[1:48:41] say die people think that you're saying
[1:48:43] that you actually died no When Jesus
[1:48:46] turned around there and he
[1:48:49] said Peter
[1:48:53] he looked at him and he said
[1:48:55] Satan you get behind
[1:48:59] me now was he calling Peter
[1:49:04] Satan right now he wasn't calling Peter
[1:49:06] that was
[1:49:07] he what was being said by
[1:49:10] Peter
[1:49:12] right what was being said by Peter
[1:49:15] brought that on that the Lord Jesus said
[1:49:17] get behind me he was talking to the
[1:49:19] devil that's right that's right right so
[1:49:24] then if the devil's not in there there's
[1:49:25] no sin that's right if you're born again
[1:49:29] right amen now we're dealing with this
[1:49:31] part out here body and spirit and see
[1:49:33] that's the end times the the Revelation
[1:49:36] to be revealed at the you know the grace
[1:49:39] the
[1:49:40] grace that was trying to say this
[1:49:42] morning that is brought at the
[1:49:43] Revelation in other words is God unfail
[1:49:46] unveiling his word to you and I that's
[1:49:49] right
[1:49:53] I I get Plum tickled at people people
[1:49:55] preach that extend to feed like to quote
[1:49:58] the prophet but you know what it's
[1:50:00] developed
[1:50:02] though it's developed that you're
[1:50:04] driving down the road now let's see how
[1:50:05] many agrees with it you're driving down
[1:50:07] the road you're running 55
[1:50:10] mph you understand you're going 55 M
[1:50:15] hour and a bird flies up in front of you
[1:50:19] what's the first thing to
[1:50:21] do 90% of the time you don't put the
[1:50:24] brakes on you look at the speedometer to
[1:50:27] see if you're
[1:50:31] speeding and check it and see if I ain't
[1:50:34] right well because you think if I'm
[1:50:36] running 55 and the bird is his problem
[1:50:39] if I'm running 56 I'm sinning
[1:50:42] you it is wrong to speed that's right
[1:50:47] but has it become that it's wrong to
[1:50:51] speed or or is it that we thinking about
[1:50:53] the bird slap on the brakes to try to
[1:50:55] keep the bird getting killed or the dog
[1:50:57] or the cat or
[1:50:59] something and you run over the dog and
[1:51:01] you say well I I wasn't speeding that's
[1:51:04] the first thing we say
[1:51:06] right we go down the road and run over a
[1:51:08] dog first thing you say I wouldn't
[1:51:11] speak when you say the first first thing
[1:51:14] I didn't get them a break since time you
[1:51:16] know right but that's
[1:51:20] life life
[1:51:23] anything
[1:51:26] else there somebody else somebody back
[1:51:29] there okay sister
[1:51:39] try um referring to Matthew 5:46 to
[1:51:44] 47 um could you shed a little bit light
[1:51:48] because here when I'm reading when you
[1:51:49] sayate the publicans um it refers
[1:51:54] to uh public officials of the Jewish
[1:51:56] nationality but how are we to put that
[1:52:00] in our
[1:52:01] own language or you got it in a you got
[1:52:04] in a different translation or a
[1:52:05] different wording from your country no
[1:52:08] no no just for here it says you know um
[1:52:11] public officials of the Jewish
[1:52:13] nationality that's what we call the
[1:52:15] publicans just the general public we
[1:52:18] talking about here
[1:52:20] or like non-Christian people yeah now
[1:52:25] see the the publicans was a group of
[1:52:29] people like you say all all right then
[1:52:32] you you say
[1:52:34] Publican that that just signifies a
[1:52:36] group of people it doesn't necessarily
[1:52:39] mean a public official it can be that if
[1:52:41] it's a public official that does those
[1:52:43] things and to me Jesus was emphasizing
[1:52:46] that the Ley doesn't have much trouble a
[1:52:48] lot of time but the religious people are
[1:52:51] the ones that will cond demn you for
[1:52:53] being something wrong you know the
[1:52:55] religious preachers and the things
[1:52:57] called
[1:52:58] publicans in that way he would just
[1:53:00] putting it to be you know and he would
[1:53:03] say publicans and then other times he'd
[1:53:05] say publicans and
[1:53:06] sinners you know he would put them
[1:53:09] together but a lot of times he just say
[1:53:10] Publican meaning a group of
[1:53:12] people like the Pharisees and the big
[1:53:15] rulers you know because that would be he
[1:53:18] he'd say you you Pharisees you
[1:53:20] Hypocrites he's not necessar talking
[1:53:23] about all of the groups it's just the
[1:53:27] the nature of the
[1:53:29] people theu publicans would just be a
[1:53:32] like you're saying a group of people
[1:53:33] yeah but it's more or less the religious
[1:53:35] people is one he was after you don't see
[1:53:37] the Lord Jesus condemning the
[1:53:40] Sinners he was forgiven
[1:53:43] them but the religious people he would
[1:53:46] always
[1:53:47] against there's your publicans the your
[1:53:51] your group of people that think that
[1:53:53] they're
[1:53:55] right and he was saying that even if you
[1:53:57] do this you didn't don't even the
[1:53:59] publicans do this cuz they did they they
[1:54:01] give and they done and they worked and
[1:54:03] they kept the law to the letter and you
[1:54:06] know and better than maybe that we call
[1:54:09] it ly people that were common ones would
[1:54:12] do so he was always just picking on the
[1:54:16] religious and signifying to
[1:54:20] people is that what you're talking about
[1:54:22] okay anybody else brother
[1:54:35] Donnie my wife wanted to asked you this
[1:54:39] question and I just want to say before I
[1:54:40] ask that I've enjoyed this series you've
[1:54:43] done more than any this has been the
[1:54:45] best for me because filled in so many
[1:54:48] blank spots and it's brought a lot of
[1:54:50] things a lot brighter okay and I thank
[1:54:53] you for it I thank God for letting me be
[1:54:55] here and hear it and you here to bring
[1:54:58] it
[1:54:59] uh what I wanted to ask you was keeping
[1:55:02] the Commandments
[1:55:07] Works yes and no because it's yes in the
[1:55:11] bases that the Commandments are there
[1:55:13] right to be kept don't do this and don't
[1:55:15] do
[1:55:16] that but see then when you get in to say
[1:55:19] as it works no it was the right thing to
[1:55:22] do in that day that's right to keep it
[1:55:25] it's a right thing to do to keep the
[1:55:27] Commandments
[1:55:28] today
[1:55:29] right that that's where people think
[1:55:31] since we come into the New Testament we
[1:55:33] don't have no Commandments and we got
[1:55:34] the whole
[1:55:35] Bible and then to find out the 10
[1:55:37] commandments brother round said was the
[1:55:39] same as the seals now that's something
[1:55:41] man right that he can say the Ten
[1:55:44] Commandments is the same as the seals
[1:55:45] but see then it's not works unless we
[1:55:48] try to make it something works is what
[1:55:52] we do because of what he done for
[1:55:56] us and in those days theirs were based
[1:55:59] on
[1:56:01] Works they done it or didn't do it
[1:56:03] that's right right because that's what
[1:56:06] they thought made them
[1:56:08] righteous Paul thought
[1:56:10] that and he said I the thing that I
[1:56:13] found to be you know I thought was right
[1:56:15] he said I found to be death see it
[1:56:18] become works with him instead of the
[1:56:20] revelation of Jesus Christ you say how
[1:56:22] can the seals be the Commandments and
[1:56:24] the The Ten Commandments was a
[1:56:26] revelation of Jesus Christ right amen oh
[1:56:30] and I first saw that I thought no what a
[1:56:32] prophet could understand that those Ten
[1:56:35] Commandments you read them Thou shalt
[1:56:36] not Thou shalt not but see you reading
[1:56:38] it wrong my brother Gary
[1:56:40] Atkins I said cramp this morning but
[1:56:43] Gary Atkins said one time you know if we
[1:56:46] read it different we read it th shalt
[1:56:48] not kill Thou shalt not
[1:56:50] steal see like a mean something if you
[1:56:54] read a little different say I shall not
[1:56:59] steal changes the whole thing
[1:57:02] though made it from a bunch of works
[1:57:05] that we thought was saving and that's
[1:57:07] what they thought they thought keeping
[1:57:09] the Commandments that's what people
[1:57:10] think if they pave the parking lot they
[1:57:13] going to heaven that's putting it over
[1:57:15] here today see if they give this or help
[1:57:18] this or do that then that's the works
[1:57:21] that they've come up with
[1:57:24] but Ain nothing wrong with P the
[1:57:28] par I mean somebody don't go to church
[1:57:30] where you might do
[1:57:32] it but we make the word of God
[1:57:36] works instead of making it a
[1:57:38] revelation
[1:57:40] right read that thou shalt not
[1:57:45] steal and then say well you know since
[1:57:47] God came in my heart I don't desire to
[1:57:50] steal no more
[1:57:53] you know that we are the only
[1:57:57] people that can keep the 10 commandments
[1:58:01] right I tried to explain that one
[1:58:04] time a born again Christian is the only
[1:58:07] one that can really keep the
[1:58:10] Commandments but it's not because we
[1:58:12] have
[1:58:13] to is we do it because we want to that's
[1:58:17] right then we understand yes you know
[1:58:22] and that's where Jesus would get into
[1:58:26] trouble went down to there one day and
[1:58:28] this this the disciples was going along
[1:58:31] plucking corn you
[1:58:33] know they rub it with their hand and
[1:58:35] just eating it you a't never done that
[1:58:38] corn that was pretty
[1:58:40] good you know I like it better baked or
[1:58:43] bowed or something
[1:58:45] but and they got on to him said you're
[1:58:47] you're disciples are do it
[1:58:52] he said well is it not even
[1:58:56] written that David went
[1:59:01] in and ate the shoe
[1:59:04] bread and was blameless why because he
[1:59:08] was
[1:59:10] hungry and hunger goes over the
[1:59:14] brother but now David didn't go behind
[1:59:16] the veil get that straight he didn't go
[1:59:19] behind the veil and get the the Mana
[1:59:21] that was in there don't get those two
[1:59:22] together the shoe bread you study it the
[1:59:24] shoe bread was out here on the
[1:59:26] outside and the Mana was in behind the
[1:59:28] veil David never went behind the veil
[1:59:30] got it he went in here and got the shoe
[1:59:32] bread that was for the priest to
[1:59:35] eat but you see the scripture
[1:59:40] says if you're going down
[1:59:42] through you walk through a field of
[1:59:45] cor you can pull the corn off and eat
[1:59:49] it but one stipulation
[1:59:53] you can't take none with
[1:59:57] you you can sit down and eat your belly
[2:00:00] full but you don't take a stock of corn
[2:00:04] or a grain of corn with you that was and
[2:00:07] Jesus said that's what he was getting to
[2:00:08] the
[2:00:09] Pharisees you know that you're out here
[2:00:12] talking about them when the Bible says
[2:00:14] they can do it the Bible was right it's
[2:00:17] wonderful the law was right it was
[2:00:19] spiritual Paul said that's right but ual
[2:00:22] man trying to interpret it made it
[2:00:25] works this message that I said one this
[2:00:29] morning when I started did I've heard
[2:00:31] people preaching going to hell for two
[2:00:33] Stone
[2:00:36] shoes you know or something like
[2:00:39] that what's that got to do with
[2:00:42] it it matter about us whether it's two
[2:00:45] tone or not we was lucky even have
[2:00:47] that's right
[2:00:52] you we would rais up like a l you that
[2:00:54] know was you was doing you had all you
[2:00:56] needed I mean uh we got a pair of shoes
[2:00:59] and the fall and they had to last to
[2:01:02] Spring of the year for some time then
[2:01:05] you didn't need them until the fall
[2:01:07] came you get with one a year you know
[2:01:12] brother Brandon when I first heard him
[2:01:13] said who's next he like I first heard
[2:01:16] him say that I like cuz I've stun it he
[2:01:19] said when he running down to they go
[2:01:20] into that swimming pool with with his
[2:01:22] buddies you know said all he had to do
[2:01:23] was pull a
[2:01:25] nail he just had one of his guses across
[2:01:28] and had a nail sticking
[2:01:32] in see you're you most you Ain know
[2:01:34] nothing to know about that or you was
[2:01:36] wealthy enough to stay away
[2:01:39] from I mean when the button fell off
[2:01:41] what was you going to
[2:01:42] do you got your nail slid it through the
[2:01:45] sucker and K it you know
[2:01:59] anybody um when it says for if you love
[2:02:02] them which love you what reward have you
[2:02:05] do not even the publicans the same I'm
[2:02:08] assuming that was the best example Jesus
[2:02:10] could give during that time they
[2:02:12] probably were it was the best example
[2:02:15] they were the people who always wanted
[2:02:18] uh to be rewarded I think in public and
[2:02:20] all that that was the best example do
[2:02:22] all the time they were doing their
[2:02:24] religion you know and doing it you know
[2:02:28] even the
[2:02:29] publicans you say it's good to do this
[2:02:31] even the publicans do
[2:02:34] that cuz the natural guy he looked at
[2:02:37] the publicans and I'm
[2:02:39] astonished uh you know the normal people
[2:02:42] in the congregation look at the pastor
[2:02:44] so they were looking back there at to
[2:02:46] fical
[2:02:47] leaders and you see a fical leader that
[2:02:50] didn't live right you didn't want be a
[2:02:52] part of
[2:02:53] it so everybody might lie of the F of
[2:02:56] the publicans or
[2:02:59] something because they were Hypocrites
[2:03:01] most of the
[2:03:02] time you that was just like brother
[2:03:06] Danny there last night a man he prayed
[2:03:07] and and the manide of him said did you
[2:03:11] pray he he said yes he said well I
[2:03:14] didn't hear
[2:03:15] you like way told him he order told him
[2:03:18] man said well I wasn't talking to you
[2:03:23] talking to the
[2:03:25] lord well you know maybe the guy wasn't
[2:03:28] trying to be sarcastic that's his
[2:03:31] business but if he was a religious
[2:03:33] sarcastic person see then he was condemn
[2:03:36] him because he walked in the place you
[2:03:37] know like used to when they you know you
[2:03:40] always watching preachers when they'd go
[2:03:42] in the door back in the old days you
[2:03:43] know they didn't say I I I want a
[2:03:47] nonsmoking sex
[2:03:52] they walk in me W up gang one night they
[2:03:54] come walking it got come in I said he's
[2:03:56] a
[2:03:57] preacher I want not
[2:04:01] smoking he want everybody in the
[2:04:03] building know he's
[2:04:06] preacher well he's got his
[2:04:10] reward I know the quotes from brother
[2:04:12] brandom and the quotes from Billy Paul
[2:04:15] not all of them but Billy Paul said his
[2:04:18] daddy told him one day he said Billy did
[2:04:21] that God hear you
[2:04:23] you he come in late from getting L you
[2:04:26] know he just about his head and said his
[2:04:28] Blessing he said God hear you I didn't
[2:04:30] hear
[2:04:31] you well I don't think brother Brandon
[2:04:34] meant that Billy was supposed to get the
[2:04:35] microphone and say it over again do
[2:04:38] you
[2:04:40] right maybe Billy wasn't sincere when he
[2:04:44] said right with those words you know we
[2:04:47] condemn each other on everything anybody
[2:04:49] else before we go it's already 4:00 I'm
[2:04:53] sorry if you will take the the the one
[2:04:56] home that says some
[2:04:59] comments you know take it home and read
[2:05:01] it I thoroughly enjoyed it I've read it
[2:05:04] over two or three times you know and I I
[2:05:07] fully agree as far as I understand what
[2:05:10] the person was trying to say in the
[2:05:12] things because that's what I was trying
[2:05:13] to say you know said the comments about
[2:05:17] what it is in other words the comment
[2:05:19] was the Lord Jesus Christ was manifested
[2:05:21] short of word of the devil whose job is
[2:05:23] to discredit the word
[2:05:25] to the word to PRT us seeing it or
[2:05:30] prevent you us seeing it revealed that's
[2:05:33] a good point read them all whosoever is
[2:05:35] born of God does not sin does not commit
[2:05:40] sin the word is revealed to him so he
[2:05:42] cannot
[2:05:44] disbelieve it's good point right down
[2:05:47] the line I don't I don't find anything
[2:05:49] in here that would be in any form that's
[2:05:51] what I was going to just read all of
[2:05:52] them and and have
[2:05:54] it a Christian does Christian who goes
[2:05:57] out and does wrong has sin imputed to
[2:06:00] his body and spirit not his soul see I
[2:06:03] like that that what I was trying to
[2:06:05] explain you so go read them you know and
[2:06:10] then you know appreciate let stand
[2:06:12] together what you come anybody has a
[2:06:18] need s to be a little ly but it won't be
