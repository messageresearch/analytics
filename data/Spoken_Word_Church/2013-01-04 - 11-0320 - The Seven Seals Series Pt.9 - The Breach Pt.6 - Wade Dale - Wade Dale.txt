========================================

it's a good start thanks brother Donnie for being here at the duty last week right uh brother brother ain't your name he got six foot tall he'd get upstairs when he grown up he'd get up into it you gotta beat somebody like us right that's fine some people don't make you know but you do like to tell how you got your fire Death all right of course he probably would have been yeah I brought two thoughts together well those of you on the internet we've been talking about pecan before we turned this thing on but anyway Revelation chapter five which is going to read we're going to read a lot out of the seal book today just let brother Brown kind of quote back what we've been what we've been talking about and then we're going to move on all right what we're going to do next Sunday is we're going to read some today out of the seal book and next Sunday we're going to wrap it all up we're going to read the whole chapter just do kind of an overview and then we're going to move into the first deal so everybody read the first seal and bring your Shield up all right chapter five now I saw on the right hand of him that said on the throne of book written within and on the back side seal the seven seal and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice to his worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing Earth neither under the Earth that means in heaven alive and even dead right anybody was able to open the button either to look there on and I went much because no man would have been worthy to open and read the book neither will look their own one of the owners said unto me we've not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book into loose the Seven Seals thereof and I'll be held in low in the midst of the throne and the four beats and in the midst of the elders now remember what the four beef there's you it's the bride John's there with all in full array and in the midst of the elders what's that 24 Elders which is the 12 apostles and twelve Prophets student lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits from God sent forth into all the Earth and he he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 420 Elders fell down before the lamb having never one of them hearts and Golden Balls full of odors which are what prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals and they're up for now what slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood redeem who he only can redeem human being right all right can't redeem angels Don't redeem angels He redeems people you don't redeem animals you understand but the animals will be redeemed I'm talking about these four B's and these four beasts are the four powers that's given to the bride to make it through in other words right and the seven spirits that lamb wasn't standing there and didn't look odd because he had seven horns and seven eyes we understand that the prophet told us that was to horn means power and eyes mean seers or prophets all right so there were seven Kingdom ages the power of God in all those seven churches and the Seven men that brought the message are the seers s-e-e-r-s that brought the message of God to see what it says which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth which is Spirit-filled men right and they sing a new song saying they are worthy to think the book and open the seals thereof or thou what slanted has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and the prophet said if we are Kings and Priests we got to have something to Reign Over and we shall reign now Scofield uh the the original translation if you have a Schofield Bible will show you the original translation the Latin translation is we shall reign over the Earth uh the King James version is on the Earth all right I like the word Ober now that don't mean that we're supposed to be heading and high-minded remember but we are going to rule and Reign Over something and we got to rule and Reign Over this Earth before that you're looking at now before we rule and ran over the round ball that they call the Third Rock From the Sun and the Earth all right everybody understand that when I see the word Earth I do not think of the round ball right I think of the one that I'm standing in like the brother said yesterday and he made a good point he said it we he said we say that we're having all these problems and we're going to just quit everything and just go out in the woods and just sit there you know and and fast and and you know get away from all my problems and he said he said you took it with you right he said you're taking it with you when you go out there you know it's a little funny little statement he said he he said it was a man on an island living by himself and some people come to see this man and he had three buildings they said what's those three buildings a man says well so this is my house and says this is the church that I went to I built this church here we go then one man on the island he said well what's that church in the middle he said oh we got a split at that church and I'm going to that church good point I told a brother one time that took us from that church of churches split and asked him to come passion I told him personally you know me I can't keep my mouth shut I said you I said if you take the split part of the church you better preach that split out of that church are you going to have a problem well six months later he was gone that church had went back together so yeah didn't know if I want to do to say anything but some people want them after a church it doesn't matter if it's him and his wife so God will make a way for you gift don't worry about that that's right well here we have the book of Revelation chapter five the book was closed nobody had ever understood it to the degree now listen everybody understood it to the degree that God wanted people to understand it that's right the book had been the physical book had been open all for years you know physically open the book preach the word of God out of John Wesley Luther Columbus Martin all those people opened the real Bible you know the Bible and read out of it and and saved sold and got people into the kingdom of God that's why when I was Minister the other night I kept saying John was a born-again Believer for 60 years and he comes to Revelation 5 and he's got a problem it's not a problem in John stole John Soul saved the book was opened just far enough for John to get into the body but in God's eyes that wasn't enough that's like you know last and I had not listened to him to Sunday afternoon service I like to listen to it first sometime that's kind of something I like to do listen to Daddy I listen to the afternoon service first and then listen to them to the morning service the second and it's just something that I can understand him better on but uh he and I were talking going downstairs and I haven't said anything to him about it but I was thinking actually coming back from Brother Oakley Sunday if people don't understand brother Brown this is going to help you in this book right here and Daddy brought it out Sunday afternoon but it was I had not heard it and we got together suddenly went down and you know he kind of looked over at me like I was playing like something was going on you know but I told him I said you know I've been thinking I said all this that we say you know run around talks about the seed always being in and he says well you weren't born on any certain day and and then he said well your eternal life started at the altar well now he's not contrary but let me tell you what happened this is what I believe happened brother Brown was you know and and I've heard preachers go through the whole sermons about Jesus speaking in Rhema and Logan Rhema being just natural human language and then logos being God doing the speaking all right even a minister told Daddy not too long or he told me about daddy not too long ago brother Pinkston he said your daddy speaks a lot and and there's a compliment he said he speaks in logos he said you have to understand what he's saying right he said because he's speaking Dutch language versus human language right pretty good for a preacher say that right about somebody else but that's what brother Brandon was doing though now it's not that he was contrary to his self what was he doing brother random would say himself and I I listened to it not too long ago or the Reddit he said sometimes I don't even know what I say on the tape I have to go back and listen to it everybody says well that's a prayer line that's the whole thing because he said there's some things in there that I said that I don't know you know I don't well who was saying that right God was speaking that now in God's eyes in God's eyes you and I never sinned a day in our life that seed always was there it always was eternal God never saw us you understand me now the the the logos part never saw us lost we'd have to kill us so brother randomly speaking from God's eyes you never was born on any certain day you always was eternal there always was a seed of eternal life laying somewhere not inside your body but I believe it was in the word right because the word of God is what he spoke out of his mouth way back before the foundation of the world all right because the daddy read it Sunday afternoon he said you wasn't he said that seed was placed in you before the foundation of the world well where were you before the foundation where you were in the mind of God right right you were the actual logos or the speech that came out from God it said let there be light that's the way we can understand the Bible all right because we were there with the guy that wrote the Bible all right so you and I are the same way when we're listening to brother Brown and brother Brown was preaching and he's looking from God's view saying you always was eternal you never was born only a certain day now he wasn't looking at flesh people right he was way in the low Gospel of God's mind that's right telling you what God said about you but then he turned around and say you bunch of Sinners you're lost you're doomed and on the way to Hell which is true you were your eternal life then didn't start for you the person now her hair is human he's preaching to human beings now you are lost right you needed a savior that's right you needed Redemption okay but now to speak in the positive Mind Of God he can't say that you were lost that's right that's right that's right you always was eternal that's right right if you're born again that's right if you are Eternal I mean if you were born again this morning you have eternal life that person inside of you never sinned a day in his life never seen a bad word never had a bad thought that's right but brother Branham was a human right he had the same responsibility of his body as he was preaching to our body right God had to tell him William Branham you're a sinner you're lost he told us remember he said he was falling remember when he got shot he was falling he was dying you know brother Rhino or William Branham you're lost all right but see when he comes on on the on the Rapture message he come up to a place where he says I'm not the son of Charles another brown but remember he was still standing in human flesh just like Danny was bringing out Sunday afternoon and that's what I was kind of thinking about coming home Sunday not knowing what he was preaching but that's the way I see now that you can take a quote that brother round said here and then you can take the quote that looks totally opposite but it's not right he's speaking from the mind of God showing the very positive God's mind is never negative it's always positive right right but he had to see the negative because he came down and human flesh that's right and he physically had a physical um eyes with with meat on his skin human skin he saw mankind saw what we needed and it could be known I believe he was walking in the Garden of Eden in a supernatural body because remember people when we go there we're going to have a flesh body but it's not like this waste body right right it's redeemed okay so he was walking in a supernatural body because brother Brown said I hugged them people and they were in their theophonies he said they were in some kind of a body so Jesus I mean God Jesus you can say he was in that body talking to Adam and Eve because it was a it was a human form it was a human body okay sad that you always was eternal hey saying like you always was in town they don't go on and quote where brother Brandon said yeah you're born again right that if you're born again that eternal life you are you've got always one that's right that flesh was not true because if you don't then you really you do away with like like that said but you know Jesus doesn't have to die for you because you always was well now let's go a little deeper than that because it wasn't because he did die but remember one thing Jesus didn't die to give you an inheritance right exactly he died to make you realize you had an inheritance right so that eternal life you have always was eternal that's right the Redemption part comes from when he was born from your mama and daddy and God give you a permitted part to permit you to come to the Earth to be a human being to have a living Soul could not be born again because that stopped when we're going to read it when God had to take that book back from Adam Adam couldn't save nobody that's right he had to come himself that's why I say Genesis 3 15 shows the whole Bible the whole Plan of Redemption is in Genesis 3 15. see to the woman I've got to come nobody else can do it I got to do it and that's what it shows in Revelation 5. Revelation 5 against 3 15 is the same thing because who comes to redeem Christ the bloody lamb that's what he was saying in Genesis 3 15. he said I've got to come down and die nobody else can do it there's no man ever going to be worthy Adam forfeited that so let's start reading hearing we'll get to that page 66 67 and I'll quote the paragraph all right paragraph 48. all right this is in the breach now paragraph 48. we're going to read a little bit today I don't want to I really didn't want to take that much time you'll have to stop me from preaching that's just the state of the teaching party yeah all right Sunday School okay the seven steel book seals the Seven Seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those Seven Seals has sealed in we're only presuming them things now remember he didn't know one thing about seal but he knew about Redemption because he was redeemed let me say again John was standing there watching what was going on being 60 years born again brother Branham standing right here in Revelation 5. probably 30 something years being born again I think he's born again when he was like 22 years old or something like that which would have put in about 1920 or something 19 20 21 something like that he born in 1909 let's just say 1933 just to add up everything 33 to 63 is how many that's 30 Years brother Brandon was born again believer for 30 years but he said if it's still if it's not open we're only presuming right so he said wow for 30 Years brother Brown was presuming that's what people in the message say that for 30 years he kind of just floundered around and he said things wrong he said no go back to what I just said remember God is speaking to you through a prophet that's right he does not if he's a true prophet he does not speak his own mind amen but there is a time when even you have to understand it even in preaching there's times when you start preaching and there's some things that that that that I know Dad does and I do too we will start ministering and we're like I really don't know how this is going to end but boy God just brings up and they'll just take it right you know just take it right where you need to go to bring a climax to the service you know and you haven't got a clue about it well that's God coming and bringing it to you all right same over brother Brandon but he had a more he was a prophet so God made that man where he could literally speak through his through his own lips and just literally take his mind out of the way and put God's mind in there and he's speaking to you and I speaking about that down inside man that's right but then you got brother Brown the human preaching now here we go I'm not I'm I'm I've heard people preach for hours trying to separate what they said I just like to say it was all God that's right there was just a human side of God talking to us and then the logos side of God talking to us you know what one thing's for sure he was not speaking to a lot of them people in front of him what he was saying it was for a future generation that generation is here now he was speaking to you and I not to those people back there not to say they're not born again not to say they're not filled with the Holy Ghost not to say some of them even come up to stack you a perfect man but to say one thing's for sure they never got the Capstone of this message until this day and time right here until the ministers because see the Bible doesn't say that the prophet one Prophet was for the perfecting of the Saints he said a five-fold Ministry so brother Brown had to give it to a five-fold minister right let them break it down because it didn't say that a prophet will perfect the Saints it said the file form Ministry was given to you to perfect to perfect you yes okay because really a prophet can't perfect you a prophet can deal okay but he brings Grace that's right he brings Grace but remember brother Brown said each one of those Messengers as soon as they hit the earth he said a plague followed on the earth what if you accepted this it's Grace if you reject it it's judgment that's right so let's read we're not going to get finished we're only presuming these things because I've told you this morning upon the little message this morning of God hiding excuse me in Simplicity you see we are we are sure to miss the thing unless it's absolutely genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit and he didn't stop there he said and Vindicated the same all right if the prophet Rises and tells you that this is that this is just that and God don't vindicate the same forget it but God in every statement and everything has to be indicated to make it right his children will watch those things see and be alert notice set was sealed on the book has those Seven Seals has the book sealed the book is absolutely sealed all right the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven sealed was broken it is sealed up with Seven Seals now that's a different from the seven Thunders see this is Seven Seals on the book all right just going down we're presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding Vindicated truth paragraph 50. and this seven seal book remember it was closed here in Revelations 5 and in Revelations 10 it is open and now we're going to see what the book says about how it became open and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book see the lamb has got to take the book brother Brown had preached to a point where he could bring that Lamb on the scene in his life same thing's got to happen to you and I paragraph 52. it's hid now remember no man in heaven no man on Earth Pope Bishop cardinal state presbyter or whoever he is can break those SEALS or reveal the book but the lamb and we have probed and presumed and stumbled and wondered and that's the reason we're all in such a confusion still I put that in there for those on the tape but when the Divine promise that this book of redemption will be perfectly opened by the lamb and the seals thereof will be loosed by the lamb in the last days in which we're living now and is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seed because remember the book was being holded in the hands of him that sat upon the throne and the lamb comes to him and him that sits upon the throne and takes that book out of his right hand takes the book oh that's deep we'll try to solve it out if we can by the help of the Holy Spirit and we're depending on him and we'll see later it is at the end time no denomination has a right for interpretation of the book no man has the right to interpret it it is the Lamb who interprets it and the lamb is the one who speaks it and the lamb makes the word be known by vindicating and bringing the word to life paragraph 55 this book is not revealed until the churches and denominational ages has run out and there is time no more now here's where a lot of people think that brother Brown was talking about him coming back and having to reveal the seal that they're still closed I had a brother called me from a certain place not too long ago didn't even tell June about it but uh that a certain brother was on Facebook blasting this church because of our stand on the seventh seal and anything on Facebook to me is rotten anyway so he's got to get on Facebook rant raving he's got a problem so and he can get into trouble and you know I don't want nothing to happen to him but bless his heart if you can't see it but he thinks brother Brown's got to come back and reveal them the seven seal okay just because of some of these statements he says if you read this and if you read this in regular reading all right we're in the seventh Church age right right okay this book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out and there is time no more now we're going to be in a layout of seeing time age until the Rapture takes place so their point is is then when the you know right at the resurrection brother Reynolds got to resurrect and teach us what the Seven Seals are and that's going to change our body and then blah blah blah but I thought the dead in Christ has to come out of the ground when the Resurrection trumpet sounds and it's got to be a live group of people to do it and brother Branham is now a part of that group he was prophesying okay he was prophesying see it it only revealed after church Asian denominate denominational ages has run out that's the reason the thing is in such a scruple tonight see they pick up a little Doctrine and run off here to one side and say this is it another one picks up another Doctrine runs offices this is it and each one builds a denominational and denomination hundred until we've got hundreds of denominations and I wrote in my book in this message but still in all of it to see the confusion the people are wondering what is true if that isn't just a condition today but then he promises that when that when that time has finished out there will be the sounding of the seventh Angels voice and when the book will be revealed see at that time see brother Brown knows as a human being he's in time but he's looking I think she said right here saying I don't he picked up somebody's thought he said don't say nobody them people ain't saved back now if they don't say they ain't safe they're safe thinking about filled with the Holy Ghost just like you are but their body is dead and needs a change from where it is if not it will continue to stay in that grave all right but the Mysteries that they couldn't understand so I can tell you today if you're born again you're caught out of the age so that you're not in an age right you're not in a denominational age I hope you might have some denominational ideas in yourself that you need to get out of but that's in self that's not insult right okay everybody understand that I can really I can and it's hard to say but you say pick out but you can pick out what brother Brown I'm saying if you'll just listen let God speak to your heart listen to what he's saying he said all the ages we've got to run out well they all run out they run out for the ride there is no other age is there no is there another bright age no I don't think so no no so all ages have run out that's right you saw your yeah your body's in the lab of CNA but if you're born again you're caught out so see when when the Ephesus Church was called out there was a Smyrna Church to come right right to be called out that's right there was a pergamist age to be called out now is there one past Dutch no no what does it go into past us eternity so is there any other agent no have we been called out yes then we're not in no age are you denominational in your soul no then all denominations that's what brother Brown was talking about he was talking to a group of people but he knew there was a group coming that was going to shave all that junk out of their life or God was going to do it and what was he going to do he was going to take you out of the age sure you're still in the age Lord we know we're in this age we drove a loudest in car we turned on our lattice and electricity right right I haven't seen any horse and Buggies coming from still in the parking lot but I believe that the people in the in the during these ages before are going to really I think they saw us they they at least saw the Spirit of the age any High minded levels of pleasure more lovers from God and all these things that lay out a sins wretched miserable blind naked and don't know it I think they God let them see and they're going to really I'm I'm serious they're going to look for you when we've been on the other side they're going to look for you and they're going to say how in the world did you make it out of the most wicked age could ever watch you think it was wicked back in the fourth age when they killed 68 million Christians brother rammsted spiritually they're killing them by the billions now and I'd rather be naturally dead than spiritually dead I'm naturally dead and I'm born again I'm okay right I'm spiritually dead and still alive I'm dead man right that's right so we have been caught out of the age so we have no more ages to the bride there is no more ages right right all right to the denomination inside of you if you're born again there's no more denomination that's right so I can see what he's talking about right not verses that that we got to wait till the literal clock quits ticking so he comes this time the longer when time has run out folks time has run out what other time are we promised we're promised a Rapture right that's it brother Brown said the next greater the next great event is the rapture of the right right so time is no longer if time was longer we would have got out here in 77. we got out here in 80 88 2000 all in predictions that people have made right but times no longer we go up when the last one comes in there's no time to it what would help me a lot on uh everybody gets Sandra Brown is coming back and people don't see it just the spirit is not the same person yeah yeah Elijah Elijah and all those well remember one thing it's the voice is what carries us out of here right it's the voice it's what carries us out of here the voice in a five-fold minister we need to read that maybe in Ephesians the Bible says for the perfecting of the Saints nobody else has been perfected and no we didn't get to that uh we got this for about three minutes let's turn to page 72 anyway brother Brown says on paragraph 69 just hold that word Redemption all right because that's what the Seven Seals are going to be but let's turn to page 72. which will be paragraph 91. this is the Adam and Eve Park that brother Branham is talking to the two different sets of people remember he's born again why in the world are we at Revelations 5 and everybody's crying we need bodily Redemption 91 and when Nature and people as the Bible are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in their ought to be condition everybody got paragraph 91. they have fallen from somewhere now if you're born again today are you fallen no your soul is not your soul just is redeemed it's God make manifest in no form all right they have fallen from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden though they didn't lose eternal life in their soul daddy cold and it's Sunday brother Brown said Adam will reach over and take hold of Eve he will reach over and take care take hold of of Abel and then Seth and all the way down the line what they're coming up all right to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's Eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God but when we died as I said in the message this morning to sin we sold out our Birthright and caught crossed this Chasm what we were born from natural Mom and Daddy natural seed all right and this this right here these couple of pages proved to me that natural seed don't save anybody because watch this yeah but when we died I said in a message this morning to sin we sold out our Birthright across this Chasm now we're beyond the reach of God no beyond the reach of God on this other side of the chasm now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given three more agency it was given to them just as we so to make a choice 94 paragraph 94. the Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sits before each and every one of us all right 95 paragraph 95 but you see when we are redeemed we are no more we no more want our own choice but we want his choice now go to paragraph 99 now when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to the word of God that's what that's what made Adam sin his wife reasonable with Satan and then produced the product to Adam and Adam turned loose the word and sold out now you know the doctrine of the message they think that Adam had to have sex with they need to save her but let me prove something right here he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life and to save space let's just go down to paragraph 103. now remember everybody knows Adam was a god of the Earth Adam lost his inheritance paragraph 103. the Earth it loses eternal life he lost his inheritance to the Earth what did Revelation 5 say we'll be Kings and Priests over the Earth there's full redemption in Revelations 5. this is how we lost it Revelation 5 is going to show us how we get it back now it passed from his hand I'm sorry I'm too loud now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan now he couldn't hold on to it because he's not a Creator and he can't do anything about it so Satan's just a squatter because remember he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan right he passed it from his hand to Satan now Satan's not the original owner you're going to see in a few minutes that the book went back to the original owner Satan just had a little bit of hold on it because when God said you'll be a serpent Now dust you'll eat that's what he's been doing he's been eating therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted now listen to this right here and the seed of Adam the seed natural seed they come forth out of his loins we're all adults we know what we're talking about the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the Earth that's right the seed of Adam I'm not finished let's go right on over to paragraph 111. it's page 75 of paragraph 111. now what happened the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the Earth remember we weren't supposed to come by saying any man born of sex was a problem of Revelations 5 was there when everybody was crying right no man was worthy there's only one man that was worthy and he was born not a thing right that gets pulled to me it gets more plain as the day is long you know right that that Adam that Adam's natural genetic seed that he had a relationship with Eve did not save him actually that polluted her more did it not that's right did Abel not die did Seth not die that's right did everybody after that now we know Eno was a was a different story but God took him to show how he's going to do us but listen do you know the Bible says that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of Adam God will destroy them now tell me how he saved Eve by placing a natural seed and he loved Eve he knew Eve was going to die if he did not say God I will take her sin she's a part of me if you and same thing as Moses God God said get out of the way and we'll destroy him right what did Moses say he didn't go run and start having a relationship with him let's just be plain right Abraham didn't go run and have a relationship with Sarah to save her when she giggled in her heart and brother around said God should have destroyed her right there but he couldn't destroy because of who Abraham loved her she was a part of him God could not kill now if Abraham would have turned around and said woman you did the wrong thing she'd have died Abraham didn't have to run in and have a relationship with Sarah to save her no in his heart he loved that woman God knew it and God knew the Integrity of Abraham that's why you sisters can't preach okay
