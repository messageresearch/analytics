on there and it was blank so I did say there was something said and I'm sure there was that well the sister that ran the copy off for Jim we were kind of in a hurry to go eat and because I had like

everything would be good so if you got your Bibles we're in a study on Daniel 70 weeks last weekend or last time we were here we were talking about the history because I want you to see today that Daniel 70 weeks is we know it's got different things we know it's all to the Jews and Israel and all these different things but there's an allegory there or there's a story behind all of it there's a there's something that you and I can glean from this it's not just something that's going to happen to them and and we push it all that way and there's there's some underlying meaning because we got a we got to realize this Israel has got to come to a Redemption but you and I have to come to a Redemption first and it's not different because redemptions not replacement Redemption if something got lost and then to bring it back then what's happening here in Jeremiah that we read last week which we're going to read some in a few minutes if you'll turn to Daniel 9 we're going to see how God is going to bring Israel back now we know one thing's for sure he can't bring Israel back to her glory days or bring Israel back as wife okay she went whoring and we read that in Jeremiah and I'll read it some more to to give you a little bit of a history and then we're just gonna read Scripture and then we'll be done so let's start with Daniel 9 so I want you to see yes this is to Israel but this has all remember scripture has dual meaning it has a meaning for you and I this is a story that's going to take place to Israel but this is also a story of your Redemption in my Redemption and then because as you know who does the redeeming God does the redeeming and there has to be a people to be redeemed so you and I are to be redeemed first then Israel then the world so he's not gonna forget Israel because he said he wasn't gonna forget Israel the man so I'll never forget it as well he'll never forget us and then because now we are married to him and there's no divorce papers being given hey man we are the bride of Jesus Christ there will be no other there will be no other wife we are the only wife that he'll have because remember we are the eve that's not going to fall amen so let's read Daniel 92112 92113 let's bow our heads the only father thank you for this day thank you for these wonderful brothers and sisters that are here Lord gathered prayerful ready to hear from you lord I pray this you would just have the active participation Lord in this service Lord the songs have been sung we've done the things that were supposed to do Lord now I pray that we'll continue and that we will be able to see or understand what you're talking about in the scripture thank God Lord you sent us a prophet that shone light on these things that were already in the Bible father we know that your little prophet did not come to change the Bible he came to give it clarity he came so that we can see the vision more clearly Lord and then that vision has become a reality in our hearts and our lives in this end time because everything wraps up now and this endtime Lord in the latter days well that was a prophecy at one time but now we are standing in that time Lord make the vision sure we're gonna read your word lord I pray that you just bless us now and take care of us heal the sick be with us as we travel Lord to go see brother Gary Lord just given comfort you're the only one you're the Prince of Peace you're the only one that can give comfort father the pray that you just bless the whole family and give them comfort to all the ones that are that are close to them Lord we pray that you just be with them forgive us of our sins Lord bless us of all of our travels that we're fixing to take and want things that we're doing may give you honor and glory in Jesus name Amen Daniel 921 says yeah well as I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who have seen in the vision now who's Gabriel Gabriel is the announcing angel all right he is the announcing angel he is attached to Israel because remember he comes to Mary and all these different things he does and tells them what's going to happen who had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation so we're here in the end time I hope were touched today by the at the evening time and he informed me and talked with me and said Oh Daniel I'm now come forth to give the skill and understanding now what a problem we have in the end time to try to understand Daniel seventy weeks it has not been skill and understanding it's been mass confusion because of what the interpretation of men's theology misinterpreted theology of the property God said but remember he cannot change the Bible God can't even change the Bible alright so we must go back faced final resting place the Prophet said is in the Word of God alright so now let's read this at the beginning of the supplications the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision we're gonna get to that in just a few minutes is how Daniel came to this place that Gabriel could come and meet him and you know why it's the same way you and I meet God Amen verse twenty four seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city now I want you to underline that in your Bible or put it on your refrigerator Daniel seventy weeks is to two sets two groups people and city got that same n so when we talk about this we're going to talk about people and the city because the city in just a few minutes we're gonna see the city it's laid waste so the city's got to be built back up God will not deal with Israel unless they're in their homeland God will not deal with Israel unless they're in their possession that God's already give them alright but God scattered them and we'll read that in just a minute because of what their transgression so seventy weeks are determined upon by people whose Daniels people Jews Israel and the holy city Jerusalem there's no other the holy city it's not Rome I'm gonna keep you outstanding cuz we won't fall asleep and upon the holy city to finish the transgression that's one to make an end of sins two to make reconciliation for iniquity 3 bringing everlasting righteousness for seal up the vision and prophecy 5 and to anoint the most holy that's six things that we'll get into the six fold purpose a little bit later down the road that's brother Branham remember he told he says six seals finishes Redemption because there's not any redemption in the seventh seal that's Christ himself so with six seals there's redemption with a sixth full purpose there's redemption for Israel because seventy weeks are determinate inside those seven two weeks the six things have to happen they can't happen outside because it says seventy weeks are determined people has to do what six things number 25 verse 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the streets shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times and we'll get into that in a little while maybe not this service and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for so you and I could come in to graft the wild olive tree into the tree he had to be cut off that all right say Amen but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city when no that's Titus in AD 70 because he destroyed the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood until the end of the war desolations are determined and he's verse 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate and you may be seated in Lord as blessing even until the consummation the property God tells us says Daniel is in prayer and supplication he wants to know what's gonna happen in two years he's desperate what's gonna happen what's what's goin on and God was so gracious he showed him all the way the Millennium that's the consummation Israel's consummation is not your future home folks you got to make that separate our consummation is the future home their consummation is that time period called the millennium that's promised to the Jews it's not promised to you and me we're there on a honeymoon so the consummation is when Israel has come back to a nation and what is going on is the millennium is started and we see that the temple is built and all those things but we'll get to that in a minute so let's start with the history just for a minute for those of you that maybe weren't here or that just for a little background and Jeremiah Jeremiah the Prophet is the one that come to prophesy against Israel because they had done so bad until God said through Jeremiah he sent Jeremiah to Israel to the nation and this is what he said 3 verse 14 turned out backsliding children saith the Lord for I am married unto thee now I thought I put in the 1 where he'd given him writing of divorcement but if you're looking last time he actually give Israel a writing of divorcement he put her away for doing this right here for I am married to you and I will take you of a city and to of a family and I will bring you to Zion and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding what that didn't happen they were all false they were false prophets Jeremiah 3 verse 20 says surely as a wife treacherously departed from her husband so have you dealt treacherously with me o house of Israel saith the Lord so what did he do remember she went out and got polluted and the Bible tells us that you once the wife goes out and she has relations with another man you're not to take her back because the land has become polluted well that's natural in spiritual okay because Israel went out prostituting their self to the other nations which God told them don't do that prostitute it to the other nations well he couldn't take her back his wife because he gave her a writing of divorcement and put her away for the things she had done because she greatly polluted the land and then but now remember he can't break his word his word says I can't forget Israel doesn't matter what I do I cannot forget Israel so he's not gonna forget her but he's gonna take her from one place and she's gonna fall but he's going to bring her back to a place not exactly where she was because he can't marry her anymore but he's gonna bring her up and give her a place because he promised the land he promised them land and the old Abraham everywhere the soul of your feet walks that is your possession all right when I see you and I don't have that we're Gentiles we're nations but Israel has a time Israel has a place that's why this Daniel 7 2 weeks is dates and times and different things because you know what if you look in the Bible in and we'll cover it later on but in Revelations 10 verse 6 it says the mighty angel put one foot on land and one foot on sea and put his hand up and said time shall be no longer right but now in Daniel which were read later on not today but later on in Daniel I believe it's in Daniel 10 the same guy shows up to them he puts one foot on one way into one foot on sea and raises his hand and said it would be for a time times and a dividing of time time times and a dividing of time three and a half years or 1260 days in the redemption of Israel there buddy got that same M alright that's Bible so they get a time time times in the dividing of times you and I don't we go right off when we're born again we go right straight into eternity ain't that wonderful we go straight into eternity burning in our eternal creatures but Israel has to come back and God's got to bring remember the people and what the city are the land you can say both but that city even Daniel 7 do we he says look going forth the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the Messiah shall be seven weeks streets going to each the street shall be built and the wall so you got to get all that together to complete this Daniel 70 weeks but just into the history part we're looking at here in Jeremiah 3 verse 20 says a voice was heard upon the high place weeping a supplication of children of Israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the Lord their God return you backsliding children and I will heal your backsliding behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord our God Jeremiah 22 return your backsliding children look at that and I will heal your backsliding behold we coming to leave for thou art the Lord our God Jeremiah 25 verse 4 and the Lord has sent unto you all his servants the prophets remember when Jesus stood on earth in other words he said look I sent you prophet after prophet after prophet and you killed every one of them I sent him to you Israel and you killed every one of them and he said in other words now you're gonna kill me I'm the one who sent the prophet I'm the God of the prophets and you're fixing to kill me too but still after even that God's not gonna forget them but he did remember they said let his blood be on us and our children and we'll we'll get to that in just a little while but we'll get back to this background Jeremiah 25 verse 4 and the Lord has sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them and you have not hearkened nor inclines your ear to hear they said turn you again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land watch how many times he talks about land that the Lord hath given unto you into your father's for ever and ever and going out after other gods to serve them and to worship them provoked not you ain't provoked me not to anger with the works of your hand and I would do you no hurt yet you have not hearkened unto me saith the Lord of course he knew that that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words behold I will send and take all the families of the North saith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual desolation what about you see Israel comes up under King David and there's peace under David and then Solomon brings in the glory years and man everybody talks about the reign of Solomon and how wonderful it was and all this now when you come to where Jeremiah's fixing to tell them they're getting registers somebody's going to destroy every bit of that I mean down to the dirt what about that that's why it says we'll make them an astonishment how can this people come from this greatness to where where David went in and and you know hardly didn't even lose a battle and then Solomon he just never had a battle he just got them all together and my headpiece everywhere and now jeremiah saying what you're looking at it's fixing to be destroyed utterly destroyed moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride so what's he doing he's taking away he's not gonna be their groom anymore he's put him away and then the voice of the bride they're not gonna be the bride anymore he's gonna take it away and give it to you and I the sound of the millstones in the light of the candle in this hole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years all right so this is we're talking about the seventy years they would be in captivity and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon now remember like what we were talking about before that naturally has already happened listen Daniel was in captivity in the 68 year we'll talk about him will tell us that because he goes back into history he was in captivity in the 68th year he knew there was two more years and he was going to come out well they did come out I think God did punish the kingdom's around them but you got to remember that has another meaning that at the end of the seventy weeks of Daniel that is talking about in just a few minutes ago that after that what's God going to do brother Branham said in the Battle of Armageddon said God is going to come and fight for Israel hey man so he's going to come on the scene after the seventy weeks of Daniel that we're talking about the four hundred and ninety years to restore he's going to come and fight for Israel he's going to punish the king of Babylon in that nation saith the Lord for their iniquity land of the Chaldeans and we'll make it a perpetual desolation alright so now let's go to Leviticus 26 you see it's not just exactly all the reading of this you we look at ourselves and we see that that we're living in part of that seven two-week up ninety seven two weeks in Daniel you're living in a now you're living in that part there in between there that where brother Branham drove the chart where the church ages were fit in are the wild olive tree was was grafted in that's the agent we're in now and we're looking at what we're looking at what's going to happen to Israel now remember some that was talking the other day about somebody going over there from the messaging and you know Israel this and there's will that huh I said well I'm just gonna be real honest with you we don't need to be over there they got their promise and we are not included in it them two prophets are not Gentiles them two prophets or who there's 144,000 they're gonna hear those two prophets not not you and me we're gonna be gone I think we need to worry about getting us ready I think we need to worry about getting me and you ready instead of worry about getting them ready because they already have their prophecy and it's already almost all fulfilled all but the 1260 days and we have zero to do with that part now we do have all to get out of here so they'll have their part but we can't change it or make it we can't rush it up the only way we can rush it up is stay here and get ourselves and get a resurrection here and get out of here and get out of the way because the only reason they're not being restored it's because of me and you right now but once we're out of here they got Bible and them two prophets are going to preach them the Bible they're gonna see Christ in them two prophets by the Bible they're not going to go walk over there and say brother Branham said they're not they might tell them how all this fourth Elijah came but they're not gonna go over there and play tapes I'm gonna say nothing else about them Leviticus they're gonna preach there's gonna be two people in skin leviticus 20:6 i that wasn't in my nose Leviticus 26 verse 30 now uh this goes back into the Leviticus this is before Jeremiah was even born this is before Jeremiah was even born Leviticus 26 this is the prophecy of Israel and I will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols and my soul shall abhor you and I will make your city's waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation you've heard that word before and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours and I will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it now this is way before Jeremiah come on the scene and I will scatter you among the heathen and we'll draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste everybody got that same man all right this is this is Leviticus this is Moses talking to them all right and then shall the land enjoy her Sabbath's for as long as it lies desolate and you'd be in your enemy's land even then shall the land rest and enjoy their Sabbath's member I told you before Israel never celebrated that Golden Jubilee they never let the land rest now they had their seven-year cycles but they never let that land rest like God told them to let it rest God says I'd if you're not gonna do it I'm gonna do it for you I'm gonna scatter you all over the world he did he dispersed the Jews all over the world but he promised he'd bring them back what to that one spot that's why brother Branham was so happy being that fourth Elijah he was so happy to see those even in his day all coming back to the homeland he knew God was fixing to do something ma'am but he had to do it to me and you first he had to get us back and redeem us before he could do anything with Israel all right then shall the land enjoy her Sabbath's I read that as long as it lies desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your Sabbath when you dwelt upon it in other words God said if you're not gonna do it I'm gonna do it for you I'm just gonna run you out of your own land let us let the land rest then I'll bring you back and upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness in their hearts in the land of their enemies now this was mighty Israel under Joshua and Caleb and David and Solomon and all these great leaders that just wherever they went they just took over but not anymore because of what they did and upon them that are left alive of you will I send a faintness in their hearts into the lands of their enemies and the sounds of a shaking leaf shall chase them while what about these great mighty people now they're shaken if a leaf just well and they shall flee as flee from a sword and they shall fall when none pursue a--the and they shall fall one upon another as if it were before a sword when none pursue it then you shall have no power to stand before your enemies this is what sin will do for you and you shall perish among the heathen they're dying out there and the land of your enemies shall eat you up and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemy's lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them so in other words at this point in time of Leviticus Moses is prophesying that they're gonna fall they're going to ruin they're going to be desolate and Israel when when Jeremiah prophesized but now when Daniel comes up when Daniels inside that captivity he's not in the land but he knows that temples laid waste because of what scripture says back in Jeremiah look in second chronicles 36 verse 17 said therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men our maiden old men or him that stood for age he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of God great and small in the treasures of the house of the Lord what do you think who's got the things now who's got all the who's got all the tools and the instruments and menorah and the Holy of Holies yeah the Titus was a Roman general when Titus came in according to the prophecy he stole all that stuff and it's laying in the Vatican right now somewhere up underneath the Vatican it's laying there that's why he shall make a covenant with many for one week hey I got your stuff if you'll do what I said I'll leave you alone here I'll give you this stuff back till that's what happened here because they brought it all back again when they restored the house restore the house restored the temple and built the walls evil in trouble as times when got to Ezra Nehemiah yep because that's what they did they built it all put it back together but remember it didn't do him any good because Christ came on the scene about 300 years after the 400 years after that and he wasn't God wasn't there in the temple anymore he was in that temple of of Jesus Christ therefore he brought upon the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with sword in the house of their sanctuary I had no compassion upon younger men are made an old man or him that's to phrase he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the treasures of the house of the Lord think about it go back and read in Solomon how much gold they had in that temple that was just lining the walls and the chairs and the millions of dollars probably at that time would have been billions of dollars of gold it's all gone now and all the vessels of the house of God great and small the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King and of his Prince's all these he brought to Babylon and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem now see to fulfill the prophecy in Daniel 9 those walls had to be knocked down and break down the wall Jerusalem because remember if you break somebody's wall down you've took away their fortification you've took away their their safety zone so that's what that wall was so they just utterly just didn't just just or the temple they knocked the walls down all right and burn all the palaces therein with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and them that escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia now what we're going to do is we're going to get into that because in Daniel chapter 9 the first verse says in the first year of Darius the son of a Soros there comes your Persians your Medes and Persians come in and under Daris is rule but we'll get to that in just a second to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah now this is chronicles remember until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's for as long as she laid desolate she keep kept Sabbath to fulfil threescore which is what three times two it's three times twenty sixty and ten make seventy I kind of said that wrong the other day and Richard yeah somebody's did it I did six times two it's not 16 it's not three times two it's three times twenty three times 20 is 60 and then ten more is 70 so in 70 years so now we also looked we see that that you say well what is all this I want you to understand one thing for sure the history of how Israel fell is the history of how you fell read every bit of that we went after idols we didn't do what God said we didn't go to the house of God with iswait we began what I'm telling you this is an allegory not of just what them poor children of Israel well you were - you were the same way but God made a promise to bring you back and thus accepting Christ put him in our heart so we get it a little bit before everybody else but we'll get into that in just a minute Genesis 29 verse 16 we were talking about brother Tim and I were talking about this and he made a good point he said brother wait if we don't when we're preaching he said if we take this people he's talking about his congregation and then the message believers he said if we take them to a man other than Jesus Christ when we get finished preaching he said we have not done our job we have not done our job if we can't show Christ in everything that we do and everything it doesn't matter how many quotes we read or don't read all right because face final resting places in the Word of God the prophet of God and there is no quote that brother Branham makes that changes the Bible if not he was not a word prophet in that see that's why that's why people attacked Daniel seventy weeks when they get ready to leave the message the first thing they do well brother man was wrong and Daniel said in two weeks you can't believe what he said you remember what Geoff Jenkins you know he gets up and says talk about the cloud and talk he starts discrediting all these things but if we can put it in the Bible it's not discrediting they just didn't understand what he said that's what we're trying to see by what we understand and we're gonna read here in a minute I Daniel understood by books and that's what we do we understand by 66 books that God wrote infallible Word of God brother Bram said he was not infallible and I agree he's a human just like me and you but that word of God is infallible the Holy Ghost inside of yous infallible what makes what makes us is we are we're not infallible than this and our human brain we run things through our filter sometimes and it doesn't come out right but what listen but look we were talking about this the other day there it we sometimes we dwell on all the wrong and all the wrong doctrines there is a right one and there is a person our persons a fivefold ministry that has the perfect interpretation just like brother Branham I couldn't get it without him could not get it without him greatest men walk on this earth beside Jesus Christ the closest man to walk besides Jesus Christ it's William Maher and brento but he's not my Savior he's not my god and he's not my pastor that's my pastor sitting right there and you know what if you'll get a revelation to that you might go somewhere but if we can't take it back to the Bible them in brother Tim if you can't take it back to the Bible then that's what they don't do that you see these people like the Jenkins and all them first thing you do they say well I read it in a Bible this is awanen brother Brent says it's this way they just don't have a revelation I don't have the Holy Ghost you leave this message and say it's wrong after walking for Hebrews six is what coming to the knowledge of the truth if you turn it away there's no sacrifice for that you're just unless you repent I I wish and I hope that brother Jeff and some of them repent and in turn but there is a place you can go too far and we just pray that nobody does but still there is listen there's a surety that this message is right and somebody through a five fold ministry is going to hear it and come to perfection that's what the Bible says my brother Dale said I see where God put it in and it would take five fold ministry to perfect his things I want somebody to show me where he took it out you can't take it out so let's do this real quick in Genesis we'll be done but before 3:30 Genesis will be done before five o'clock Genesis 29 verse 16 brother Branham comes up and he's look at you looking you reading the book and he says one week equals seven years you go how do you get that well you didn't just pull it out his hat and it wasn't a revelation that wasn't already in the word so we go to Genesis 29 16 and Laban had two daughters the name of the elder was Leah now remember leah was the older so we have two we type her with Israel because Israel is the older alright kind of like with Ruth and Naomi Naomi being the older when Ruth had the baby she gave it back to Naomi which is type of us giving the message back to Israel so anyway Leah was tender eyed but Rachael was beautiful and well favored now remember you got to remember one thing just like Abraham which was his daddy is coming in here we watched Abraham comes isaac isaac was a promise son had to come through Rebecca I mean I think had to come through Sarah okay the break I'm mixing these up had to come through Sarah not through Hagar so the promised son of Jacob Jacob had to come in and bring Rachel was the one that brought the last two children right when Benjamin and Joseph which Joseph being the perfect type of Christ so Joseph wanted her Jacob wanted her first Leah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve these seven years for Rachel a younger daughter and Laban the con man said it is better than I give her to thee then that I should give her to another man abide with me now in laymen's mind he was not going to give him Rachel because the scripture said way back over here that the elder supposed to get married first yield you give the elder daughter first right so Jacobs working for Rachel for seven years and I don't know it must've been a real dark night because he got Leah sometimes I wonder about that he worked seven years for one girl and then all of a sudden he wakes up the next morning and there's the sister but Israel had to come in he had to come in to get him to be with Israel first before he could take Rachel so Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed them to him but a few days for the love he had for her same way with God he's he's went through 2000 years of being separated from me and you but he wants to see us face to face and man he wants to see his bride he don't want to come through a filter of his and just hearing your voice and communing spiritually he wants to stand in front of it he wants to be able to be right there with us same way with Jacob but now watch Genesis 29 verse 27 says fulfil her week and we will give the also this this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me at seven other years he had already conned him and got Israel Leah so now Jacobs got to work seven more years or seven more church ages to get Rachel his real true bride because remember there were seven church ages in the Old Testament and seven churches in the New Testament all right but fulfill for a week and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week which is what seven years one week equals seven years so you can rock that if you want to in your top of your Bible rhythm there Daniel now one week equals seven years all right everybody got that same man fulfill her a week so he fulfilled her seven years and finally got Rachel in verse 28 right so now let's go and let's look at how we title this today Daniel's confession his brother Nell has been preaching in many times we say the same thing get closer to God pray and read your Bible it's kind of hard to do but in Daniel 9 Daniel has been he grew up in the captivity he had been 68 years away from home he had been 68 years away from where God showed him where the promised land was so what does Daniel say now look Daniel 9 verse 1 says in the first year of Darius the son of a source of the seat of the Medes which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans and the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Israel everybody got that I Daniel understood by books you and I understand by sixty-six books and eleven hundred sermons we have been taught just like Daniel and will read your quote where brother Bret says we are reading the exact same thing tonight that Daniel read four thousand years ago cuz he was reading Jeremiah and brother branham's talking about reading Jeremiah you and I reading the same word will read it here in just a minute but this is Daniels prayer that brings Gabriel on the scene so he can talk to him same way with you and I we must confess watch him confess and I set my face unto the Lord God to seat by prayer and supplication prayer and reading your Bible with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession now look have you ever thought about this Daniel what was he confessing he did everything God told him to do man told him to quit worshiping he threw the curtains back look toward Israel and prayed to God to Jehovah so yeah he was praying for himself but he was also making confession for the whole of Israel and made my confession said O Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the covenant of mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from the precept and from thy judgment neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets listen David Daniel is sitting there reading Jeremiah and Jeremiah saying I through God God through Jeremiah said I have sent you this person this person this person God has sent us preachers preachers and more preachers what are we doing with it neither have we hearken to the servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our Kings our Prince's our fathers and to all the people of the land Oh Lord righteousness belongs unto thee but into us confusion of face as at this day and I say that that's that's true now there's more confusion in this message than anywhere else sorry to say because of why turn down true message heard a preacher got up the other day and was preaching and he he looked out in the congregation he said we've had enough teaching well it's kind of like somebody was saying today I told that and since I think it was Aaron he said well he's cut himself off from being perfected because teaching is part of the fivefold ministry I don't care what well I don't care what you what your problem is with teaching you know what you know why you don't like teaching did you like to go to school and I was weird I did but did you really enjoy you knew you had to go kindergarten first grade second grade third grade fourth grade all the way up to the club good Michael do you enjoy guns go why cuz you had to study and you had to pay attention I'm just thinking you out man you appear in front I mean really think about it and I was telling this sentence cute class look what we talked about teaching just stop for just a second cuz we're just gonna read the scripture and we'll be done you look at teaching there's there's teachers listen my sister teaches kindergarten to third grade kindergarten now she has a so sheís what's just a highest degree her say something she has a specialist degree which is almost to the doctorate you'd have to call her dr. Anna not dr. Roberts maybe but dr. Anna why because she came to a place but now dr. Roberts and I'm gonna say it because I said it downstairs she's a kindergarten teacher she's a teacher but she can't drive today and go to Piedmont College and be a teacher she'd be going y'all sit down shut up quit this quit that you gotta go to the bathroom what do you mean you see what I mean there's teachers of different levels that's what I'm saying you've got kindergarteners but you hope they come up to who are there in college but they were all the teachers or teachers but you got kindergarten teachers you got first grade teachers you got middle school teachers you got high school teachers you got college teachers same way in the bye in the message of the hour you've got teeth you're being taught it doesn't matter if you're listening to an evangelist but for somebody to be so narrow-minded to say we don't need teaching anymore what the problem is it's just like I told y'all about 20 years ago and I'll say it again we haven't got out of Pentecost yet I'm not talking about 1906 I'm not talking about 1830 I'm talking about Pentecost doctrine a Pentecost so where were we Oh Daniel nearby books let's get finished with this verse seven Oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto lead but unto us confusion of faith that's what to me teaching takes care of confusion how many of you been in this church that weren't in this church before come started coming to this church and you thought you were confused about certain things but now you're not confused well I got my hand up I turn the camera around because there's another miracle okay if you hadn't if you don't raise your hand you got a problem what are you doing here you're just sitting here like a knot on a log or what listen it's the end time it's the time of the evening oblation we have come to a place to where it's gonna be remember they love Jesus when he was prayer lining healing the sick making more bread but when he said I and my father are one they went away unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood what doctrine he started preaching doctrine he started teaching the people Nicodemus you must be born again Nicodemus is so blown away says ma guy go get back my mamma's wool he shouldn't know a little bit about that but he didn't is his eyes were blind Oh Lord to us belong this confusion of face verse eight to our kings into our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord our God belongs mercy and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets Daniel knew they were doing things wrong he knew that they were doing things wrong and he was what confessing verse 11 and yea all Israel have transgressed the law even by departing that they may not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oat that is written into law Moses we read that over in Leviticus and the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven have not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem as it is written in the law Moses all this evil that's come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God that we might turn from our iniquities and understand that truth therefore hath the Lord I hope you thinking about this for yourself therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he do it for we obeyed not his voice and now O Lord our God that has brought that people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have gotten the renowned as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly Oh Lord according to all the righteousness I beseech thee let down anger and thy fury be turned away from where the city Jerusalem the holy mountain because of for our sins because remember the temple didn't sin Jerusalem the city didn't sin the walls didn't sin but the people sinned and it caused the walls that same way was with Adam Adam's sin caused the fall caused everything to happen and everything fell below it okay everybody got that then what as Redemption has got to bring all that back so in the 70 weeks of Daniel remember there has to be a people restored and the city both you got two things you got to deal with all right that's what the people of the message get it wrong it's got to be the city and the people because the Bible says so I Bessie see that not anger and not fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem the holy mountain because of our sins that their sins is what knocked the wall down and for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people Jerusalem and our people are become a reproach for all that are about us now therefore o our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and caused my face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate Daniel knew God wasn't in that temple because the temple was gone temple very late wife's the temple was gone they don't walk knock the walls down everything but Oh God in climbed on ear and hear opened our eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercy O Lord here Oh Lord forgive our Lord hearkening do defer not for that own sake oh my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name and while I was speaking now watch the all that Daniel from verse one to nineteen that was Daniel praying to God for him and his people saying Lord come back do something we're desolate we're sitting here where are your people brother Branham I like what he said he said you know what God likes for you to remind him of his promises God likes for you to remind him of what he said he was going to do it doesn't hurt his feelings but he knew Daniel was going to do this that's why you see Daniel you're so greatly loved because your supplication has done this right here and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and is any my supplication before the Lord my god for the holy mountain of my God which is what Jerusalem yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and taught lament said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding not confusion at the beginning of life supplication the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision so listen this is Daniel is pinning this but it's Gabriel that said seventy weeks are determined upon thy people so he's talking to Daniel thy people and on thy City Gabriel is bringing this vision to Daniel alright and Daniel accepts it and continues on but now let's read these two quotes and then we'll be finished right here Gabriel's instructions to Daniel we'll get back to that when we come back next Sunday first quote 1961 7:30 this is the first sermon of the three part sermon their brother Bram preached that everybody says it's so confusing he sure spent wasted a lot of time if it was confusing God don't waste time folks he sends a prophet he sends a prophet for a purpose amen now there's our lesson for the next three four or five meetings he just read the scripture of whatever the Lord will reveal seventy of weeks now last doc if you will tonight to put up my board there now remember this is Gabriel's instructions the next night or that night he preached the six fold purpose and then the Sunday after that he preached the 70th week y'all understand what he freaks he preached the seventy weeks he preached the 70th week on that third Sunday's everybody got that look in your book the book says the 70th week not the 70 weeks the 70th week all right so he brings two parts Gabriel instructions of Daniel the sixth full purpose and the 70th week everybody got that say man I want that to be clear because it's going to help you to put up my board there so that I will be able to mark it out I don't want you to miss it now you've got to study with me and study deep or you'll miss it you know they're all quiet nobody said a man study deeper you'll miss it and I want to draw it out here on the blackboard and he did and we have the original picture that he drew that was confirmed by George Smith that that's exactly the drawing that Rebecca drew for brother Branham mm-hmm so we got all that and we also have a drawing that brother Branham drew on a napkin at a restaurant the day or two after he preached hitting this the exact same drawing so folks we ain't go making you drawing the one he drew was right all right but that's what he's talking about right here and I want to draw it out here on the blackboard and then you bring your pencils and paper and write down these dates these times and all about it you reading now the seventy of weeks begins now get this after the church is taken out huh what ho brother Adam be careful now the seventy of weeks begins after the church is taken out because remember 70 weeks seventy weeks we'll talk about a little bit later it's all condensed into one week we'll read you the quote where brother brian says 72 weeks equals seven years cuz that's what he just said now when he drew his chart because I'm gonna tell you something when you see the chart seventy weeks started back in four or 606 BC before Christ before the church agents began before the rapture takes place you've got to be careful to remember what he's talking about now the seventy of weeks begins where's that all right - mines sectioned off now the seventy of weeks begins now get this after the church is taken out now everybody understand that say man the congregation flies they meant I do not believe they knew what he was talking about they still don't now after the church is taken out and we'll explain that which I want you to hold that I want you to kind of chew it and then regurgitate it when we come back revelation 6 to 1 to go to 71 there you go revelation 6:1 - revelations 19 21 is connected with the seventy of weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain the why these seventy of weeks because if you don't you'll miss the seals you'll miss the trumpets you'll miss the vials plagues three unclean spirits like frogs three woes casting out of the Red Dragons woman in the Sun you'll miss it all if you don't because it takes place right in their 70th week you believe that say man you don't understand it failed me because some don't and that's okay but we're gonna explain it because you know what he's a prophet and he's right I have no problem with that I have no problem what he just said I don't get all nervous because that's in the Bible we leave on 6:1 come back in 21 not even but look that's right here real quick that's where it takes place in that 70th week now the prophet Daniel has been in babbling for 68 years you who wants to run reference back and save yourself some of the time that I've had to looking it up 68 years he went into captivity in BC 606 and when the vision came to him was BC 538 538 from 606 leave 68 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst heathens and still has the victory amen we can't stay an hour in one place he says Gabriel I mean Daniel lasted sixty-eight years kept the victory and didn't even have the holy go cuz he didn't even have the baptism holy goes like you got and he still kept the victory you know what he did what God said now let's read number two and then we'll quit right here Gables instruction paragraph 113 this is the one most important scriptures in the Bible Wow brother Bram said at one time he said revelations 5 is the most sublime scripture in the Bible because it talks about Redemption but he said this is the one most important scriptures in the Bible what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish nation the Jewish people this scripture the seventy of weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation it's one of the greatest timepieces how many heard me say if you want to know what day it is look at the calendar if you want to know what time we're living in watch the Jews that's right they're God's calendar taken from right here any theologian any Bible scholar any we'll tell you that this is the timepiece the Jews now what time we got we're just people hot and everything you know fainting it has nothing to do with the Gentiles the seven seals seven plagues seven whoa seven trumpets has not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time don't have nothing to do with us the Gentile church it only deals with Israel down Daniel by people and Jerusalem and it discloses the facts that God deals only with the Jews when they are in their homeland hallelujah you say oh my lord what do we fix and get into it's clear to me I know exactly what he's talking about I had a good teacher which taught this in 1974 so this is old news some people can't get it right now 50 something years later but it has nothing to do with the Gentiles seven seals seven seals well the natural part of it no but the spiritual part we get all that spiritual part we don't get no plagues literal plays we don't get the wolves we don't get the seven trumpets or not to us they sound after we leave but we'll explain that a little bit next son used to stand our feet musicians come we've got a little bit of time there's not gonna take us that long get down there let's sing it one song brother luison but here's a man Daniel the Bible says greatly beloved because he got on his knees and prayed he defied the nation he was living in and the king that told him oh please always turn that thing off man anybody need prayer sister Gail we were we were down in Maysville yesterday and they went through that Civil War Reenactment maintaining I'm telling you I wouldn't want to be around in a real war it was just a few cannons being fired off I date for two or three hundred cannons and fifteen and twenty thousand men start shooting at each other man it was horrible about like that all right let's things let's sing a song if we can let's just love him four oh four all i want to do is love them give see four oh four listing so if you have a need [Music] so good Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calvary somewhere well crazy I know I want to do is love him Oh meaning is lovely [Music] for me Jesus paid the price of religion Oh God we're pretty I know be the same all I want to do is love love is [Music] you know you you think about Daniel and you see a man that was exiled from his from his home it was in Babylon just like you and me are now what this is not our home we're in a place that we're not supposed to be but we're well just like he was and we we know that we're coming up Daniel knew there was only two years left and something they were going to be released there something was gonna happen to try to bring everything back together again and he wanted to know what was going on and then Gabriel comes up and tells him not only what's gonna happen when they get released but what's gonna happen all the way to the Millennium how that they're going to be restored and how that they're going to they're going to turn them aside down and and house it inside there there's going to be you know it's not in the Bible but there's going to be a a Gentile bride interjected in there and then there's going to be one week left after the rapture for the Jews to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel it's all in the Bible so don't be scared I know maybe sometimes this is it's a little bit it's not exciting but you know I all the years I've lived if you ever have a question about something there's a little bit of fear that goes along with that because you don't know exactly what's going on or if somebody brings you a question if somebody somebody you know asked you something even about Daniel 70 weeks and and people get all upset about things woman it's in the Bible we got to make our thoughts and ideas fit that Bible whatever thought we have and whatever thought we thought we had whatever we thought we thought brother Branham had he's got to fit the Bible he can't change the Bible the Bible is exactly correct there's no way you can change it and then you know what we can be sure one thing if we can see it in here if we can see it in here the message will be much more clear of what people think of the confusion there's no confusion why in the world would them why wouldn't eternal God send confusion now he sends confusion among people that want to be confused but now the people have his own children why would you want to confuse your own kids he'd be a horrible father if he wanted to confuse his own children he died and he wants us to understand every word of God and I believe to take a body change we gotta have this thing right I don't I don't know about you but but you know we you just gotta have it right and there's somebody that's gonna have it right and God is gonna put somebody in the pulpit to teach you that it's right I just believe that I'm just dumb enough to believe something like that because you know what there is no other way you're gonna get it there's no other way you're gonna get it you know what I accept that it's like brother Dale was talking this morning about brother Bob brother Bob just didn't go down to the to the thing is maybe the second largest law firm in Atlanta and go I know one job they said well watch your qualifications he's will now finish high school he said dude you need to go back and finish a few more years what he had some learning but he didn't have all the learning that he needed we've had some learning but we just had not had all that we needed amen cuz we got to be brother Ram called a spiritual astronauts now the astronaut is not a dummy an astronaut went to school went to school went school when school and school let's go went to simulators flight simulators I was not gonna ride with you unless you had your pilot's license no way can you fly plane I wouldn't ride with you I don't ride with you if you didn't know how to fly one but it's just like it's just like brother Dale said the reason Bob got where he was at is because what he went school he went to school and he had to learning to learn how to do what he does and each one of us the same way we've been schooled in life if we've not been schooled in anything else but God bless you as we dismiss Daniel got something from God by praying and reading what Jeremiah said he pulled him Scrolls back he might only had Jeremiah's rotten brother Larry he made just that one book but he got enough out of that book to bring Gabriel into this dimension and say old Daniel so greatly loved I'm gonna tell you what your heart's desire is let's bow our heads do heavenly Father thank you for this day thank you for the word that you've given us Lord I know we're unworthy creatures but you've made us worthy you told us if we'd study and read our Bible you told us if we would read the prophets message that we would get these things and you said you would send the Holy Ghost to do one thing and that was to teach us what you've already said and show us things to come Lord you're the teacher without the Holy Ghost we don't have a teacher but that inward man is the teacher they teaches us Lord and we have to depend on that Holy Ghost to be true and it is it's all these other ideas that everybody else has that gets it all messed up but Lord as Paul said one day said we have the mind of Christ lord may we please take that mind and deliver it to the people so that we can take a body change and get out of here have a resurrection but lord help us have a resurrection right now that will get rid of all these other things Lord and have a resurrection and new and you Father you'll bless this Lord and the things that we that we are hearing from brother Dale and all the different preachers Lord here different places Lord we we pray that you would just sanctifies for this journey lon those who endure to the end that word endure simply doesn't mean that we're gonna have a real good time at it it's just we're going to endure but Lord you told us to endure to the end and we'll be saved probably give us this day our daily bread because of our trespasses to be with us on the highways as we some of us go down and pay our respects to brother Gary bless his family Lord give them peace Lord you are truly the Prince of Peace and we depend on you for all things that we do Lord we ask your blessings take care of us Lord at all these we take a little trip Lord and the pray that you just bless us be with us is coming back be with the reed girls as they come in next Saturday Lord just all these different things Lord you said they're angels and capped around us Lord to help us in our daily journey father we thank you for that Lord we pray that you just bless each one take care of us in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed oh Jesus pay the price every day all new cross of Calvary [Music] great Asian I know all I want to do is love
