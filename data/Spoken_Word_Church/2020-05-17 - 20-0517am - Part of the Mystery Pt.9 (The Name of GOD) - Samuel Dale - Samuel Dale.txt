all of these that are sick and all this brother I'll remember him brother or brother Dale and these were real bad parts you know remember that and just keep them constantly in your prayers though you know the others are sick too but some are sicker than others you know and that that's the point that we need to pray heavily on as on to that thing okay remember brother Aaron see back there downstairs brother Aaron will be ministering Wednesday the Lord willing so we'll just remember that we will be having a baptismal service after the evening service now so we'll get through quick and go down and have a services of hope I was hoping a brother would come that has called me about getting baptized and I told him what we were going to do today so I hope you'll come but maybe he'll maybe he will get here but remember all of these anything any other announcements yeah everything's running good then so we want to go to Genesis 1 and Genesis 3 and take our thought for today all right you have any father we thank you for this day and your grace Lord and thank you for everything we know and realizing today an hour that we're living that Lord we have no hopes of anything whatsoever of this life or situation it all rests in you and we just depend upon you to make manifest your word and to do as you said you would because we've depended on you so far made it all these years so we just keep dependent on you just have your way now and got us and be with each one remember this sick ones among us in order those that are real serious sicknesses remember those cases but remember all the others are not father different situations and all and we ask you to just be with each one have your way in their service today as we try to Minister your words you come and speak to our hearts and minds in Jesus name we're going to Genesis 1 and 1 and then we'll go to chapter 3 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth now we're just gonna start from there then we'll go over to verse or chapter 3 and we'll start we can start with verse 1 and the serpent was more subtil and than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said you shall not eat of that ever ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and woman saith unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said it shall you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof that your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil and the one the woman saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to be make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto her husband with her and he did eat the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together now coming on down to the ninth and tenth verse made themselves aprons they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou we'll just stop there because that gets our point of what we're going to do you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I've done this in a series and I'm trying we'll be doing it in a series I'm gonna just do a couple of messages but I've done this back years ago and trying to help to understand to me you know the name of God we said well what is the name of God well other than I know God it's God you know God is not a name it's a title to a night it's not a name in being the word g.od as we take it and run it through we say well let's know closely you can make a God out of anything all right you can make a god out of a piano or whatever you want to do ever different things and you it won't come out right but now if you'll take it correctly that's the marvelous point if you'll study the Bible from just a simple little illustration you know I believe it will help you to understand if you'll read the Bible and notice the what you're saying all right we read here in Genesis 1 and it says and God Zod all right that's in a what you call of if I get these wrong you put it in the right place and all but that's more of a lowercase form because even though the G is in okay but the EO and the D is in a smaller case so it's a lower case so even when you start off in Genesis you start off with the basis of having to depend upon the rest of the word to be able to come out to understand what's taking place because it's about 30 something times they're in Genesis 1 that it uses the word God all right and that word God now is the word Elohim ok which means self-existing okay alright so now that's what we're doing is trying to put it into a point to understand and to get it in the right order and then even the children should be able to understand you know the things of looking at the Bible because you know we talk about it we say well well God is not a name we'll see they're told and they'll say God the name of God or something like that but that you know to us we understand that that's meaning that that was the way they've done it when they wrote the Bible and they just wrote the word g.od all right whether you would have had that in a total upper case is we'd call it with the Geo and a big deal on the end of it or big letters or whatever you know it all will come out to the same meaning because the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new there's just one God all right now so then you start in your looking at it and you say well now what is the name of God you know alright so now children we say what God is not a name daddy's not a name father's not a name you know those are titles to a name alright so there in Genesis 1 you have it seemingly God help me with it cuz I'm trying to break it down instead of having a long series I remember this from years ago that I talked on this and I'm putting it in to a point that I hope you will understand and listen to my point now to your adults and understanding of what I'm saying where we ended in our message dealing with and they without us cannot be made perfect etc etc we wound up coming down to the Godhead as being not complete without you and me right you remember that's what the Prophet says that it's not complete without you and me the Guardian one because you're part of God all right so then when you come down to that basis it'll come to the point of understanding how beautiful it was back there and what happened in Genesis in God riding the word all right now and you put him in there and writing the word and he wrote all of the things but then it's so odd that once he spoke of the creation brought it out about the creation you know the Genesis and the account of all the things in and we pray well God created all things all right now so that word there is Elohim instead of using the word God so you can read it like this in the beginning without him Elohim was without him and Helen was L ahem going over to John one see and bringing it back to Genesis 1 alright and thinking about the in clear up in a minute now what I'm trying to do all right but did you notice now we read in Genesis 3 you just got through with the creation of mankind everything and then you jump to Genesis 3 and look what it says look what happens in Genesis 3 if they'll pull that one up we'll hit and pull up Genesis 3 you'll notice it is it uses an outstanding thing to statement it talks about the serpent talks about the things and it says in the field that the Lord God had made all right now then it keeps continuing on talking it gets up to the back of the tree gets up to talking about serpent and all of the different things and it's using the Lord God and understanding and you've just you've moved two chapters in your Bible and now it's got Lord God you say well what does that mean to us alright see when they were translating the Bible Translators are supposed to translate by words I say supposed to because naturally some of their thoughts is going to enter but they're not supposed to be translating by revelation and when they was bringing down the Bible to us especially toward the English understanding you know and bringing it down to that then you see that something happened here and they use Lord God and it stays in that form throughout the whole Old Testament basis to use the word Lord God all right and see that means something has happened to the understanding of the person who was to put down what was going on and in Genesis 1 it can be easily understood that that's out of him that was the only way they could come up with anything because the L of him would have within it the all of the understanding about the name of God brother Branham says you can literally translate there in Genesis and say if I said the beginning Elohim created right because that's who is talking about but now tell him then still itself now is coming forth as a title because it's not a full meaning of a name it's more of a title to a name all right and see that's why it's changing from Genesis 1 and using it 30-something times and then you get to Genesis 2 it uses it and then you get to Genesis 3 and then you got it from then on throughout the the Bible that it'll use and it'll say Lord God alright if you'll go back if you want to you can pick up from Scofield gives you a good understanding cause he's a theologian and read his point dire and brother Branham says let's see where's that you'll get number three though they will know that brother Branham was tied this together just bring in number three this is taken from be not afraid all right someone said to me not long ago said brother Branham you don't believe that that was actually God's standing guard aiding a cave I said I sure do Abraham called him hello him do you know Abraham called him el ahem anyone knows that that's capital lor demon Richard was talking about that yesterday that the jeffersonville didn't pick that up that should have been capital letters over there you know because brother Ron said capital L Ord all right that's all kinda but C translated into the Greek Elohim which means a self existing one all right now the word Lord comes from the word Jehovah okay so now you've got a beautiful situation to coming in to Genesis 2:3 going on that when it uses Lord God its jehovah l ahem alright now watch the point what is Jehovah the Elohim means self-existing etc all of the think all of the titles of tie together to ela him and come out to be the correct understanding of the name of God even when we get to the name Jesus okay all right because don't worry about it you can take the name Jesus and run it backwards and you can run it all the way and it'll come totally out into the Old Testament and come to the words your Joshua comes out to be the name of translating from there down to get to the Jesus okay now but listen one combat see now you've got Lord God your Elohim is fine because you've got that understanding okay and all the titles will be related to Jehovah I mean to Elohim and it comes from Jehovah now you know yourself there's seven compound names of Jehovah right Joe Vijaya Jehovah kiss can you do over sale on all of those comes from the name Jehovah alright now it's your over translated into English understanding is like a father with his family now that's what your your Jehovah stands for our hour comes to the point of understanding it's like a father with the family so he's Jehovah l of him he is the self-existing Almighty God that drew Lord Himself down toward the human race begin to the writing of the Bible and when it does immediately the understanding that is brought into that the writers pick that up and they say wait a minute this word God here is okay here but now we've got another word now I don't know what those words are cause I'm not a Greek you know I just have to stay with what we can do with the English language and that's bad enough all right what do you follow what I'm saying so you can say well al ahem we can use that as the word God so we can reference throughout the Bible and use Elohim God you can come over to Hebrews one God in sundry times and diverse miners spoke to the fathers known in the New Testament coming up still with the word God using it as Elohim the self existing one all right but remember what self existing means existing by yourself so had he stayed with Jehovah I mean excuse me and he stayed with just a word that they used to bring out Elohim see the you and I wouldn't have never come into being nothing would have come into being are you with me you see why that is if this takes months for me to try to break down a thought for you to see but we will try to do it real fast but you get to point out you see Elohim has all the relationship to everything that you want to talk about in front of Ron centers now then he brings it up a notch to Jehovah and he says Jehovah the old is jesus of the new alright now what is jehovah's are saying means a father with his family so now what have you got Jehovah Elohim which means the eternal God now exists with his creation and that's exactly what he done in Genesis 1 God Himself the great Elohim the self existing God lowered himself to start the writing of the Bible all right and it writes and he comes over and he covers all the whole creation okay then when you jump over to chapter 2 or 3 you start picking up another name in there and they said the writers had to give an understanding so they they brought it down to as I said jehovah l ahem alright now you can take it to Jehovah Jireh Jehovah tsking you you could take that word Jehovah and it'll run through the seven compound names of Jehovah and when you're coming through the Old Testament then you say well Jehovah is this not know Johor it's not a nine you say oh you're you're confusing us God's not a name then we get out of him that's not a name now we get Jehovah and that's not a name because there's one scriptures Isaiah again that's the forgotten brain but if you're talking to a Jehovah Witness and they tell you the name of Jehovah was Jehovah you know the name of God was Jehovah just tell them the Bible says by my name is your whole words I never know the scripture that's he said I say all things by my name Jehovah words I never known he was never known as Jehovah Joel was not the name of God Jehovah is a title to a name Elohim is a title to a name Yahweh get into all of those things that people pick up and bring forth and it has to that's meanings to it what the meaning is is you've got a little understanding here that defines this person that you're describing you're describing him as well ahem self-existing that's good but now you've got himself existing if it's self existing is correct that means nobody didn't exist with it right so now you got a problem you're all left by yourself all right so the old that you know they understanding from Genesis 1 brings you to the understand that Elohim and who he is Genesis 2 3 then it starts over and what it does it brings out to understand Jehovah our Lord God all right now I want you to notice something so that you'll keep it so pull up number one brothers no I'm using us to those on the internet and everything I use a Scofield Bible mine is a 1909 because I always have used the 19 not that's the earliest Scofield or any of them Scott you can't you can't go now and buy a 1611 Bible I don't know of anywhere you can order one from you can't order it I tried to order 1611 from Scofield publishing part you know getting down to where they the publisher you can't do it all right but look in the beginning g.o.d now that has the meaning of self existing but it's still not his name alright god unveils further into starting in Genesis two and three and when he does he uses the word Lord God the translators knew something was being said this is a description see when you say God created the heavens and the earth alright whose God is it my P Anna no is it my car no it's self-existing that's as best as you can do that's the best meaning of a word can be broke outside of the name of Jesus because Jesus is his name right I don't get tired of that point then you just remember it we'll get back to it next week Jesus is his name who watches what's the name of God Jesus it's not Jehovah it's not out of him it's not all that all of those titles and references comes to the name of Jesus right because that's that's his nothing but look what it said these are the generations of the heavens of the earth when they were created when I he created you God created Genesis 1 Genesis 2 says the Lord God created are you listening see that means if something was interrelated here more than what was up here in Genesis 1 now you've got something to understand where and you come up with the word Jehovah now you've got your hova el ahem because remember Genesis 1 brings up the creation of man the creation of every time right come on the creation of everything is covered in Genesis 1 even to the creation of man even to his physical creation and his spiritual creation made in the image of Almighty God right that's in Genesis 1 because that's the self existing because once he moved and they picked this word up and said well we've got to put this word Lord in here and when the translators looked at that they said we'll wait a minute we've got to get an understanding so they said now what can we do with Lord so they come up with the jehovah huh now you got your over el ahem which means you've got a father with his family there's families in Genesis 1 come on we're supposed to be in the message enough to understand you've heard Wade preached for a whole lot of years I hope you understood that of Genesis 1:26 and 27 you know let us make man in our own image and let them have dominion etc etc see you're standing in Genesis 2 looking backward but you're picking up and when they brought it into that a word appears and I said I don't know how to express these things I just try to get you to look at something but see they wound up and they say okay now we've got it Elohim is not a name Jehovah means father with his family that's getting a whole lot closer to a name but y'all was not a name Jehovah is like Elohim it's the title to a name that's why you're Jehovah Witness say well we're Jehovah's Witnesses I told one of them one time I said I'm a greater to your over witness than you are he looked at me and he said you are I said yeah cuz I believe that you're over the old Jesus or the new and he one of them started to the car the other one wanted to talk and the one in the cars kept saying come on because he doesn't run into something that was crazy to him for somebody to Sejal over the old of Jesus of the new you know I guess he figured out mindful to get out of here but there's this simple point and what I want you to look at how can you how can you fathom I guess is the best word for how can you fathom the name of God how can you understand the name of God see you've got to come to that word they used and translated the word Jesus you've got to come to that to be able to have one true and living God now get what I'm saying did the prophets a Jew over the old is Jesus of the new he said it's the self same person he said there's not another person involved see so when ello when you take Elohim and put your over with it that's not another person that's what I'm getting you to see Elohim Genesis one created Genesis 2 says Lord God created 2 and 3 both used Lord God and it uses about the creation so then you're looking at something that is understood by Revelation to see and we've got the Prophet to back up what we're talking about to understand and he says now that word out of him is capital L Ord ok g.od when it starts in Genesis is not used in a capital form now I've bummed this and hollered and we went to it life's not me and Richard did and we had it all going to weigh in known and then we lost our way and I didn't have my notes to go back to I got him but I could never find I couldn't find him but anyhow we went back to find out something that was a marvelous thing see when you use the g.od that's a lowercase but what if I can show you that the Bible uses g.od in total capital lot you're gonna have to agree there's just one true and living God you think this ain't into the Godhead do you want to talk well we're talking about the Godhead this is getting into the Godhead this is what I love this is what I love to talk about and show how he come down to worry where we are for us to understand you realize he had to do that he had to condescend the self existing one that existed before the world he condescends to be Jehovah Elohim a father with his family then you can wind up see that jesus' isn't angling to get let's see look at it look what they do in genesis tuna they know they still got this l of him the translators he knew they had their word god that was the word God from Genesis one so they know to keep that but they pick up Lord and that's lor D capital letter C because you're getting closer to the name I have to use it anyway cuz it's only in I know how no education see I'm sorry I'm ninth grade in them I can't help that but I'm just do the best I can to try to speak by revelation and I keep referencing back to what the Prophet said because that's where I got it from I didn't have enough sense to get the rest of neither did the scholars the scholars got enough now the scholars know you doubt him study Scofield he'll tell you a whole list of line about Yahweh and Anna Donna and a Donna and he's gotten many many many things he covers the seven compound names of Jehovah Scofield covers them if you want to study it from just looking at what he's saying but see you're trying to come down to an understanding okay so you've got Lord Capital Lord you pick it up and you keep that capital Lord I know how time to do it I got a lot of the notes linen but you pick that up and you keep that Lord God now I want to give you a key if you'll just take it and listen when God is speaking from heaven are you in the when God is speaking from heaven now if you don't believe me you go read your Bible go over there and read where God come down and talk to even to Cain where God come down and talk to Abel and God came down and talked to Abraham if you look at that word lor D you'll find it appearing in your Bible form all the way through as showing you God is speaking to mankind God is revealing himself maybe I better use the word like that instead of speaking to man so-called speaking is hard to understand but I'm just giving you that that even came in the bad situation it was he never came down he came down and still was signifying toward the Cain that Cain now listen this is gonna go and I'm just putting this in but you know yourself a lot of people in the message believe Cain couldn't be saved now I differ with that I differ with that because of all the whole Bible in the prophets message the Bible says he said to Cain he said if you would have done like your brother who was talking who was talking to Cain Almighty God Jehovah because at that time until Cain done what he done Cain was still a child of God right because we're all children of God don't try to get no serpent seed lines in these things with me that won't work we're all the children of God Cain was just as much a child of God as able as far as the physical human element the difference is when he showed his color and he went and killed his brother right but get what I'm talking about look at that word Lord and keep that as you study your Bible how many it remembers this how many remembers the first time you got you got into the name of Jesus you'll remember that when you started in the message you know how that you all you you knew that the name of Jesus and water baptism etc and every time you looked in the Bible in the determining they said something about tonight you remember that in every tire you turn it was something not to name I mean you'd be over here in Old Testament and they say something about the name you come over here to say something bout the name a way of illustrating is a crazy one but you go by you a purple Cadillac and you go driving down the road thinking I got the only one I got this some special I got the only purple Cadillac about that time meet me and God goes by and there goes another purple Cadillac right that's the way God he is he deals with all of us the same don't worry about whether your serpents eat or not I don't care if I could learn run my lineage totally back and put it straight there with the Beast I wouldn't have anything to do with it because my salvation is not based in that my salvation is based in the Lord Jesus Christ and what he'd done for me you understand what you see so you got Lord God Jehovah el ahem you've got the bouquet signifying who this is the person remember Lord God now what did we have Lord Capital lor did he slice it back well they'll make sure it stays in your memory now if you don't you lose it you say so you see one comma Lord God Joe Vella him of so case did he use in that lower case because he has a reason I'll get to that in a minute and Macias Lord God so it appears our throughout the Old Testament and Lord God David it speaks when it comes to him and the Psalms and everything it uses Lord God Jehovah Ella him but now let's throw a little key in a lot of people would call it a cogwheel but I call them a key go to Genesis go to number or excuse me go to number four number four now watch sometimes appear and remember when you come up to something and when they had to put a name or thought or whatever they had to have it related to the entire Bible so I look at not now excuse me we need to yeah that's okay we using him before yeah which jumps all the way over to Abraham and Ray broom and look what it says and Abram said Lord God he drops to a lower case but he raises to a higher case to signify that he knew what he was talking about he knew who he was talking to you remember in songs where it said the Lord said unto my lord look that up you'll find Lord in great big capital said unto my lord the lowercase you come to Abraham you come to understanding now this is just not a father with a family this is a revelation of Almighty God and it comes down to a capital letter all the way Joe and if you understand your whole were the oldest Jesus of the new you understand that then that's exactly what it's doing but look what it said the Lord Abram said Lord now Abram said that himself cuz he he was signifying something he knew who he was talking to right this is when he gets all nowhere you remember you were supposed to been in all of that with white understudy okay going down to go to verse 6 and we're save reading and he believed in the Lord now while ago he had lowered in a lowercase I'm screwed now you got it bad and he believed in the Lord and it came out he counted it unto him for righteousness and he said unto him well who's talking now and he said unto Him God speaking to Abraham look I am the lord that brought thee out of the earth child needs to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it did you notice something over here you had Lord God now you got Lord in front in the lower case but you get God in a higher case upper case whatever your English majors are you just put all of it in order and it'll get to point but you notice that they're in Genesis it can go backwards and forth okay go ahead - go ahead - number six boat number six which is taken from Genesis 28 20 lower case is the God lower case of salvation unto God upper case the Lord belong the issues from death spell it the same way right in one sentence lowercase uppercase so now here's where we're gonna have to take and we'll try to do this real quick what you see when the key is one thing when you realize that Genesis 1 God had condescended to write the word God himself had condescended to write the word as long as you're dealing with God that away you can use that word God and this is fine you can put it in capital or you put it in lowercase because it means assign the self existing one is talking to you but it's like it is with Cain are with Abel or whatever it says the Lord they even speaking to K the Lord said to Cain he had not told him away he was still his child until sin entered the picture but when sin entered the pictures we came then he fell away from sonship right see as long as God is speaking to you and I he can speak through somebody a minister or to one another a sister to a sister a brother under the anyone whatever and you can talk about the Lord and God can use your voice to declare his understanding to Cathy from right right but you can also switch and go from right to Cathy see we want it that way so we want to man for no it's not necessary that's what I'm getting at because you get on over into their new house Sarah go through your Bible and read yeah you have say run you're how Hagar and C we throw Hagar out the door right we just say that that Hagar was a remember God provided her in that child water and put him right back into lineage and that lineage stayed there after then right back in with Sabra Hagar Ishmael Isaac playing together may be older than the other one get what I'm saying you said well I talked to the Lord this morning that's good what you see if Donny is my Lord see you go back to you go back you got to pick this up and get the point if you want it I got it at home I've got an original 1611 King James I mean 16:11 version King guy yeah it has all of the books in it that was rejected out of the book of macabees there's two books we've gotta know you've got to Eton's you've got different different things that was left out of the King James version of the Bible now remember the King James Version let's get a little sensible about it but you laugh at my carnality the King James Version is not American English it was King's English thousand dollars and dollars and Watts and all of the things and you can't even hardly read it I'll be glad to loan you mine you can sit down and read it it's in the Old English language it's not into American English that was translated later or put on over into what we call this common English that's why have you ever heard brother Ron say who was he talking about but he said the the man that what's-his-name the writer the one that he likes and he put out the Bible you know that man said the Bible was written in in Arabic allo Yiddish common ordinary people's understanding see if we'll take the Bible and think about it if you're listening the Bible is put into our language from the King James Version of the point of the Old English language that they used does that make sense or is that bumfuzzled you see we've got it where it was passed on down from the regular King's English you want to get in some Kings English go to Jamaica but they speak perfect King's English go to when it's it's in Brazil when they speak in English but especially in the Philippines get a lot of them they speak good keen English good language they don't used irons were over here and over the HAR and what you are you add you know let see we say well I've gotta talk to people they say I've got a 1611 King James Version short to me that's Schofield 1909 was the first one 1611 was your King James Version you had him up until I was allowed to get them and I lost one of them but world-- used to put out a King James Version which left out all of the Book of a khabees all of the thing mine's about this thick because it's got all those books in it that was left out of the Bible now you know how the King James Version came into being yeah I'm trying to show you this to get you to think about something the King James Version the is a translation of translations and many of you know that have you ever studied it they took 40 something people King James did he took 40 some people and put him in groups in that group he would give him a scripture and they would take that scripture and when they came back to the core of the group all of those say sent out five groups you know each one of them had to compare exactly when they came back together or it was not put into King James Version King James Version is not a translation of yeah actually you don't like this one but that's our hi good news for modern man has a base core more real than King James because you know what to base core the good news were not a man or a literal translation you understand what I'm getting at see we think we know all about these things and then somebody comes along and said something about it well I don't know what in the world you're talking about well where have you been I knew that for her of the profit the King James Version was they took those manuscripts and and the things and some of the versions that they had and thought and they put him in there to him and gave them that and said come out of there with the right understanding and if you think that ain't a way of God leading so you got 10 different groups that know with our study in the same one scripture and here they come back and lay it down and all of is exactly the same maybe not wording literally the context that's what I love it I love the King James Version because of the fact that I know where it come from and how it got into our hands the work we can understand and he doesn't mean that you've got to go back and find this Lord and all of these things that's not to understand it the understanding is what is the Bible trying to bring I hope you get the point of what your prophet see it he said now hello him he said that's capital hello him CAPITAL LETTERS he said showing you that it's in emphasizing the point of what you're talking about that you can actually look at this if you look in our minute ago you've seen it you had God spelled in the same verse with a big G OD and a little G OD you see when I come out here and say the Lord spoke to me you know what I can be saying that I just read it okay or I can say the Lord just spoke to me holding up brother branham's these are not here but holding it up represent and I have one in here in one quote you understand what I'm getting at then you've got Elohim carry that all the way through carrot all the way through your understanding don't lose that because that's the self existing one when he came down and created a world he was still self existent when he created all of and I listened when he created all our Genesis one he was still out of him then all at once he creates something that was a part of himself he's no longer self existing that's what I love no longer does he exist alone he'll never exist alone again why because Jehovah the title that was brought out signifies that he becomes like a father with his family he brought man into being I brought man into existence and then you can use Lord God and they've got a lot of here to work they don't say Lord our God the Lord backwards and forth but if you just remember what he's talking about it doesn't say that God spoke to Cain it says the Lord spoke to Cain you say no it's signifying that God Himself spoke personally to came and offered him salvation but he turned it down he offered him everything that was offered to Abel and I don't think that because he was cerfancy what are you don't call me I had that years ago throws in my face don't call me sir plant seed big boy you know what big boy wasn't referring to him being fair proceeding is referring to me I was referring to myself because what are these old bodies that we live in it's surely not a seed of God I hope you got a little better sense than that I can quote brother on him see he said you're born between what Satan and Eve I don't care what you think about yourself like I've always said you know they say well my family came over on the Mayflower oh you know we're we're a royal seed we came to America so did a bunch of crews that were stow away in the bottom of the thing to escape the place over there and come over here but you see we think we we think we're something you understand what I'm talking about God had to come to earth he could come and create and bring all of that into existence but he had to come himself personal that's where your java's picked up he becomes personal on earth right there to bring his family into existence then you got the word Jehovah like a father with his family the test still not is 9 they see ones that don't mean nothing to me call the big letters and look smaller this letter that letter I don't make no difference for me all right Oh get ready to quit how about going over to number seven and let's just read something cuz remember Jehovah's not a name Elohim is not a name Yahweh is not a name all of those great titles you hear the preacher is preaching about today Adana and in all the different they've got all kind of different things and every one of them is trying to do it with this look now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise they didn't italicize that it didn't bold it right it didn't raise it up because it's telling you what happened yeah when is his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child with all the goat okay and she shall bring forth a son okay over to 21 I shall call his name Jesus bold letters in other words get away from up here this record that mankind is making now we've got it straight Jesus was born from the Virgin Mary as Almighty God come on he'll bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins and you her not till she had brought forth the firstborn son and he called his name Jesus bold letters drop down one verse when Jesus was born in Bethlehem you back to small letters he said what are you doing I'm trying to tell you the name of Jesus but let me tell it to you for brother Branham that's where it ought to all come from anyway right what did brother Branham say about the name of Jesus he said there's many Jesuses the next Jesus Jason in this name you Spanish to cut into Jesus y'all you got all kind of Jesus which there's only one Lord Jesus Christ there's only one name of God that's Jesus so they bold it and made it up to where it would appear check your Bible won't see if it doesn't yeah but then when they're just talking about him and who he is it's coming back but now he's 9 his name is Jesus you remember the story Mary was with child of the Holy Ghost Marie leaves and she goes to Elizabeth Lizabeth his pull back up in the country there because she's really embarrassed oh she's six months pregnant with a dead baby alright John had not moved six months John had not moved right but when they met Mary said Elizabeth I hear you're pregnant said yeah I'm pregnant but I'm kind of a little worried about it I'm just paraphrasing the scripture you read it I'm kind of worried because the baby hasn't moved I'm very sad well Elizabeth I'm pregnant too Oh Elizabeth says woman oh you and Joseph you've got married she says no I conceived a child of the Holy Ghost he said his name is Jesus he said as quick as that name was spoken by human lips now remember what said by human lips did John received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb find me that in the Bible he said well put him in it she only were that mary goes up to Elizabeth the name of Jesus had done been pronounced washed but there's the key there the Prophet you what he's talking about when the angel appeared to Mary said call his name Jesus right do you need to add do we need to pull it up call his name Jesus John didn't receive the Holy Ghost at that because that was an angel Mary goes up and tells her salutation but she doesn't call the name of Jesus when she first starts her discussion with Elizabeth her discussion is what has happened to her and she has conceived a child learn your Bible they when Elizabeth when Mary spoke the name of Jesus was the first time a human being used that night the other time it was a angel sometimes angels were not children of God the when Mary said to Elizabeth but it's not even written that away this there is the salutation that when Mary says to Elizabeth angel met me and I've conceived of the Holy Ghost and said his name is Jesus find me that in the Bible that says his name is Jesus from Mary you see we're taking what a prophet says thank God he said the first time the human being spoken not the first time an angel means I help spoken the name Jesus had been used daily in all kind of things because it was Jesus was a common name but when Mary gave her salutation what was her salutation Elizabeth I'm pregnant too Elizabeth says you and Jones know me and Joseph ain't married I'm Harry he said listen that I met an angel and said I conceived of the Holy Ghost not an angel angel couldn't bring that seed to Mary he could bring that a letter form to rain but not to seed that the Holy Ghost is as quick as she said that John leap in the wound of Elizabeth and it says that Elizabeth was filled with the Holy go see we don't like that we want to make it John was filled with the Holy Ghost that is good because that's what happened we remember Elizabeth how many we find life's not for and see when Simeon was speaking he was filled with the Holy Ghost you got about four times of different ones that was filled with the Holy Ghost this was a salutation what I conceived a child of the Holy Ghost to fulfill the scripture they shall call his name Emmanuel they didn't call him Emmanuel l-listen they did but he didn't is that sensible it was told in Isaiah to call him Emmanuel which is God with us James will refer into that but he says he'll call his name Jesus see Jesus is the only name God ever had Jesus is the only name God ever had show me another name all of them are titles Jehovah Jehovah Jireh Joe over tsking all of that Yahweh's all that you go through all of those great things that these people out here in the world will preach you on a lot not against that I'm just telling you that's what they do as the holy ghost come to you to tell you wise name is called Jesus come on the only name God ever had is Jesus you got no titles in life the titles are there cuz they're in reference is coming through but his name is Jesus his name is a fulfillment of ever prophecy ever thought ever saying ever Yahweh's ever Jehovah ever Elohim Zelo all of those things is fulfilled in the name of Jesus now see you're not even reading your Bible I come in my father's night well what was the father's name hold your hold well and now the title come on what was the name of the father Jesus those Jesus said I come into my father's night oh that just makes us Jesus only uh-huh no I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ there's just one there's just one Lord Jesus Christ that's why he said ask anything in my name because his name is Jesus I'm only giving you half the story the rest will be finished next Sunday Lord with it so just think about these things but think about it as you're reading your Bible listen listen to us say it he says the Lord spoke to came I used that because we don't want a reference with came but the Bible said it yeah what do you think the great eternal johor was self-existing elohim condescended to sit down and have a discussion with Cain and said you'd have been received had you done like your brother I'm quoting Bible he said well what was what was that name the Lord said unto my lord like I didn't finish I want to go so I'm glad to come back to that point okay in the Old English that's what you had you had a lord which is a guy over the properties that he's Lord you know I mean you could talk about your neighbor he says he says run Lord my lord how you been doing today because it had that reference as to what it was it was just but it referenced like a something with a family and he say the Lord said unto my lord let me tell you this the way okay maybe you'll even get mad enough to think about it to do something brother branham I'm asking you a question what is the new birth you remember that from Chrysler mr. of God reveal what is the new birth letter Brent him what is the new burrow is this the baptism of the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ didn't reveal to you his name you see one listen Church I'm not throwing off on nothing doctor I'm just trying to tell you how that God has helped us would you go right over there and they'll tell you about the name of Jesus I've heard preachers preach about the name of Jesus and just bring tears to your eyes but did no one realised they know nothing about him he's my Savior he's my healer he's my Hall in the hall never a reference in the Bible he's referencing to Jesus Christ in my name it said you'll cast out Devils the Holy Ghost which will come in my name that's why brother Brent says water baptism is a very important thing he said because you do not have a promise of the Holy Ghost under Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism you need that you don't have a promise of the Holy Ghost you only have a promise of the Holy Ghost when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I hope this little point this took me six months the last time don't I just leave it to you to think about yeah I can say to brother branham I can say Lord what did you mean when you said the baptism when the whole ago cuz I'm speaking to him as a senior point or movement or knowing I can get my answer we're gonna get into that word comes into a bold letter we're gonna get into something where a man stood before a burning bush and he said and you hear me say it over and over so when I get started you'll know it say it God said Moses go to Egypt he said I am NOT going I can't talk good I can't do nothing and he doesn't God says I'll take care of the hand Aaron of in your prophet you just be a god to them well okay but still or not what am I going to tell him tell him that God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said I know of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I know all about the historical gods and all I thought what's it what's your name about what name shall I tell Pharaoh did I do these things you remember what he said to him at the burning bush and check it out and see if it's bold letters you'll know we're gonna get to something just go there and check it out he said I am that I am not making it to fit now cold I don't like to change scriptures or me but a lot of people that sounds odd it comes out hard to me but when he went down to Pharaoh he said Pharaoh didn't let my people go he said who's gonna take him out of here he said I am do you know you can bring that up and show that God was there but I'd rather bring it this way Moses knew who he was at that time he understood who he was and by that time he knew if there's coming out of there he was gonna take him so he said I am I'm gonna take him out now you can take it and say both of them is right to say I am him referring to it's personal it's correct but to say I am him referring to the God that was leading him to bring him out it's the same thing I am that I am that one more word what was this Elohim self-existing when he appeared are to Moses he appeared to him as ever-present for eternity because that's what I am means those things are in the Bible for a purpose Church don't just play with your Bible and and say well I don't understand this or I read it and when you're reading it look at who's talking and what's talking and look at iron you'll see the Lord is speaking to people the Lord Himself he's talking to us he talked to us through the Prophet to bring us the message he can speak through mama and daddy to speak to you about the message just remember we're still just talking about Jesus well brother Dale I want to know his new name I haven't wore out Jesus yet that's just honest now not derogatory her hateful just honest I ain't wore out Jesus yet when I wore out Jesus I'll be looking for a new name well while I'm waiting I can say what the Prophet said he said maybe it'll be made known when we get there I didn't say that he's the one who said it let's talk about Jesus come on musician don't run Joe can you sing that and let's talk about Jesus let's think about him we're having our regular services
