[20:46] like that little song uh
[20:48] I'll be right there somewhere listening
[20:51] from my name that was that was kind of
[20:54] where I was going this morning so that
[20:55] was the right song to be saying I'll be

[21:00] that's what we all are looking for to
[21:03] hear our name called uh this morning I'm
[21:05] going to go right to the word of God
[21:08] I'm gonna be reading from the book of
[21:10] Saint Matthew the seventh chapter
[21:12] 21 down to 23
[21:15] in Revelation the sixth chapter and the
[21:18] verse 8.
[21:21] praise God this the book of Saint
[21:24] Matthew the seventh chapter
[21:27] and the 21 verse
[21:30] praise God I'm gonna use that a little
[21:32] bit too because that thing got some big
[21:34] lettuce
[21:36] I'm going to try to read it right here
[21:38] but when I really just thought I might
[21:40] have to use that up there amen so it
[21:44] says not everyone that says unto me Lord
[21:46] Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven
[21:48] but he that does the will of My Father
[21:51] which is in heaven for many will say to
[21:53] me in that day Lord Lord have not we
[21:55] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[21:58] cast out devils and then thy name done
[22:01] many wonderful words
[22:04] and then
[22:06] will I profess unto them I never knew
[22:09] you'd depart from me either working
[22:12] iniquity
[22:13] and revelation 6.
[22:19] Revelation 6 and I want to read verse 8.
[22:23] and they said and
[22:25] I look and behold a Pale Horse and his
[22:29] name
[22:30] that said on him was called Death
[22:33] and Hell Followed With Him
[22:36] and powers given unto him over the
[22:39] forefoot of the of the earth to kill
[22:42] with the sword and with hunger and with
[22:45] death and with the Beast
[22:48] of the earth as prayer
[22:50] father God
[22:52] help me one more time to you my body
[22:55] my mind my spirit my soul God
[22:58] Lord help me to get myself out of the
[23:00] way God now father God take over the
[23:03] service God in Jesus Christ's name
[23:05] amen God bless you this morning you may
[23:08] be seated
[23:10] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[23:12] word of God this morning
[23:14] I took from the scripture this morning
[23:17] by God grace I'm going to try to save a
[23:20] little bit of energy for this evening so
[23:22] you know about God grace so if I don't I
[23:26] got a backup plan yeah I got a backup
[23:29] plan
[23:30] Maybe
[23:33] amen so thank the Lord so what do you
[23:36] want to say about God great I looked at
[23:38] the scripture this morning and it says
[23:40] right here not everyone that says unto
[23:42] me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of
[23:45] heaven but he that does the will of My
[23:47] Father which is in heaven Hallelujah
[23:49] another word it is said well many will
[23:51] come to me that day and then where they
[23:54] using the name of the Lord and they're
[23:56] casting out devils and they heal in the
[23:59] sick and they prophesy and Jesus is
[24:01] saying I never knew you right
[24:14] and his name that said to him was called
[24:17] Death how do you know the words United
[24:20] took was titled this either this morning
[24:24] falling from the position of power
[24:27] and uh yeah I began to realize and I was
[24:30] thinking when I started studying this
[24:31] message falling from the position of
[24:34] power and I began to think because
[24:36] everybody want Power everybody wanna a a
[24:39] position or a a some type of authority
[24:42] to feel like I'm in control how did so
[24:45] we begin to live but I'm talking about
[24:46] falling from the position of power and I
[24:49] looked in here and I began to study this
[24:51] out here a bit because he said your many
[24:53] will come to me in that day using the
[24:56] name of the Lord people you do not have
[24:58] to have the Holy Ghost to get the name
[25:01] of the Lord to work if you any demon any
[25:04] drug or any prostitute could use the
[25:07] name of Jesus and somebody could have
[25:09] faith and a miracle take place how do
[25:12] you showed that that was a day we got
[25:13] the world full of people that could use
[25:16] his name without living his life
[25:18] Hallelujah we begin to realize here so
[25:21] you know you say well they know the
[25:23] anointing there I knew there was
[25:24] something to play that was anointed when
[25:26] the Beatles played right how did Peter
[25:28] thousands of people got healed when the
[25:30] Beatles was playing but that was not
[25:32] done in the name of the Lord that was
[25:34] not done in the light that he had it was
[25:37] under the inspiration and people come
[25:39] out of the wheelchairs honey so we just
[25:41] don't want to it's not depend on that we
[25:43] want to know here Jesus said he that
[25:46] does the will of My Father which is in
[25:48] heaven how does it shall begin to relax
[25:50] but we want to talk about falling from
[25:52] the power of position
[25:54] as I look at this
[25:57] what was the first fall
[26:00] from Power with position yeah the first
[26:03] time did it ever been recorded or
[26:06] something falling that had power and I
[26:09] began to set it and I began to think and
[26:12] then when I looked in the word of God
[26:13] the first being I seen that had power
[26:16] and position Hallelujah and had had a
[26:19] had a at a position in heaven and that
[26:22] was luciferable so the first fall is
[26:25] started in heaven and started with a B
[26:28] called Lucifer and what gave him his
[26:31] position was his name right
[26:35] I want you to notice here that Lucifer
[26:38] name had Authority behind it had name
[26:41] right there had positioned and would
[26:43] lose the boy was in heaven he was a name
[26:46] looking but he walked under the among
[26:48] the codes of fire he shied the
[26:50] Revelation he was over the choir he was
[26:53] the oldest he had a power position
[26:56] so when he and I want you to notice this
[26:59] have you ever thought about this when
[27:01] losing will fail
[27:03] from Heaven his name means uh his name
[27:07] means a bright uh Morning Star has also
[27:11] has named me a bright light so he in
[27:15] other words so he's fallen if you notice
[27:18] when he fell from heaven Hallelujah he
[27:20] was falling and he let any as he and he
[27:23] began to try to force the another will
[27:25] in heaven instead of the will of God
[27:27] I'll just I want you to know that when
[27:29] he fell from heaven what did God do if
[27:32] you notice in the scripture where
[27:34] losable fail God took his name from him
[27:37] Hallelujah when he failed God no longer
[27:40] called him Lucifer anyway if you know
[27:43] him his name would change
[27:56] and when he entered into the garden God
[27:59] changed his body
[28:01] all right Hey listen we begin to look
[28:02] here we find her he lost his position
[28:05] now I want you to know sure but I once
[28:07] started this war well with the war it
[28:11] was the power wheel
[28:15] it was the power wheel right if you
[28:17] notice there it was the power of the
[28:19] wheels Elizabeth wanted his will over
[28:23] the will of God so if I begin if I
[28:25] looked in the scripture and I would read
[28:27] from the book of Isaiah 14 we're going
[28:29] to see this battle start he wanted to
[28:32] change the will of God to his will
[28:36] Isaiah 14 I'm gonna read a few verses
[28:39] here
[28:41] he telling Lucy he's speaking here
[28:43] there's a battle going on and he's
[28:46] telling him he's a hard up falling
[28:50] Isaiah the 14th chapter verse 12 he said
[28:53] how'd I'm falling from heaven
[28:57] oh Lucifer
[29:00] son of the morning
[29:02] how to cut down to the ground what did
[29:05] weak in the nation
[29:07] for thou has said in the heart of what
[29:11] I will
[29:12] I want you to notice here he was it was
[29:15] a power a will
[29:17] I will either I will Ascend into heaven
[29:21] I will
[29:26] I will set up on the mountain of the
[29:29] congregation in the size of the north I
[29:32] will Ascend above the heights of the god
[29:35] I will be like the most high he is
[29:39] forcing a will in heaven
[29:42] the anointing said here yea thy shall be
[29:46] brought down to Hell to the size of the
[29:50] pit honey and then what he's losing the
[29:53] power position
[29:54] he been stripped down how did his name
[29:57] have been took away from him and I'm
[29:59] going to give you another name
[30:01] I'm gonna give him a name he gave him a
[30:05] name that he could never in any
[30:07] circumstance ever be saved again
[30:10] Hallelujah we begin to realize you and I
[30:13] want you to notice this if you never
[30:14] noticed this before
[30:16] have you ever noticed that the Book of
[30:18] Revelation talk about name
[30:26] he started with he it was constantly he
[30:29] was dealing with names Hollywood because
[30:31] in other words now we realize here that
[30:34] God we realize this is how this is the
[30:37] day that we're living in that the word
[30:39] of God must call you Hallelujah number
[30:41] call you by name you must see yourself
[30:45] in the scripture now and it shall begin
[30:47] to look here if you notice you're like
[30:49] think about like Revelation like
[30:51] Revelation 2 and verse 17 he's I'll give
[30:54] you a new name how did Revelation 17 in
[30:57] other words of Revelation 13. he had we
[31:00] find out that they had a name of black
[31:02] female Hallelujah Revelation 17 and
[31:04] verse 5 he's not called your name Shall
[31:06] be Called mystery Bible the great
[31:08] everything was identified by name
[31:18] I want you to notice this here
[31:22] Jesus began to deal with his church by
[31:26] name
[31:27] if you notice here it's Satan say Luke
[31:31] say Luke 10 verse 20 he says he said now
[31:35] we're standing he's a Rejoice not
[31:38] because the spirits accepted unto you
[31:42] he never rejoice
[31:44] because your name is written in heaven
[31:48] Hallelujah your name is written in
[31:50] heaven honey don't you rejoice because
[31:52] you see Power don't you rejoice because
[31:55] you see Devil's leave but Rejoice
[31:57] because your name is written in heaven
[31:59] but the problem was at that time they
[32:01] didn't know it right right it was a
[32:04] revelation Hallelujah if you ever find
[32:06] yourself here you my let bro self say
[32:08] here this message is my Revelation you
[32:11] cannot read your way into the Kingdom of
[32:13] Heaven you cannot study your way into
[32:15] the kingdom you must be called by the
[32:18] revolution of the word must call you by
[32:20] name and catch you and you catch a
[32:23] revelation with his Lord
[32:28] not because they have power uh Spirits
[32:32] which everybody would want to see this
[32:34] kind of move of God but here he is Jesus
[32:37] tells me here he was here he's a moral
[32:39] Rejoice because your name is written in
[32:42] heaven a name that cannot be removed
[32:45] under any circumstance how do God got a
[32:48] bride in the back of his mind and the
[32:51] devil cannot take her I cannot take her
[32:54] from the mind of God I don't care what
[32:56] the devil try to do God have called you
[32:58] before you even know who you are how did
[33:01] Jacob I have loved amen
[33:05] happy boy any boy had done any good evil
[33:09] I knew God could look in the back part
[33:11] of his mind I like Brother Sam said he
[33:14] can look through foreign
[33:22] so you remember him I'm just wondering
[33:24] if you notice your
[33:26] when brother Brady Pizza seals it was a
[33:30] name he began to deal with
[33:32] if you notice here I like the way it was
[33:35] in the in the book about Saint John 10
[33:38] it was said to him the the poor to open
[33:41] the door and the sheep hear his voice so
[33:44] now he's here he's not only opened the
[33:47] door but he's calling his sheep
[33:49] Hallelujah in other words and and he uh
[33:53] called his own Sheep by name and lead
[33:56] them out I'll destroy realize here he
[33:59] not only called you but he called his
[34:01] sheep and I call him by name and I'm
[34:03] leading them out of here I got a bride
[34:06] here I'm not gonna let the world get her
[34:08] I'm gonna call her her Revelation is
[34:11] going to hear my voice
[34:15] Brandon goes here and he uses a quote in
[34:18] the in the first seal I'm using I'm
[34:21] reading from the wholesale book how did
[34:23] it so the numbers will be a little
[34:24] different and they wrote it over but the
[34:27] old Shield book he says in 122. he said
[34:29] the members of his bride
[34:32] their name was put in the Lamb's Book
[34:35] of life before the foundation of the
[34:39] world it has been sealed up now you've
[34:42] been revealed whose name was in there
[34:45] all about it so he said they was already
[34:49] enough God put it in the loud Book of
[34:52] Life how do before the foundation of the
[34:54] world and if God said I'm going to have
[34:57] a people they will overcome the
[34:59] Antichrist Spirit how do they will
[35:01] overcome the power of this system right
[35:06] and then he says and he stays back there
[35:08] and I dropped on down and John's hears
[35:11] everything in heaven every day
[35:13] underneath has said amen and blessed and
[35:17] honored anyone he the judge saw his name
[35:20] Hallelujah did he go down here now he
[35:22] must stay back there he must stay on his
[35:25] intercession Paul until that last Soul
[35:28] come in and he have called it by name
[35:30] Hallelujah I don't know where it may be
[35:32] and it might be somebody that need the
[35:35] Holy Ghost this morning might either
[35:37] last Soul come in and then he'd call you
[35:40] by name you will recognize this message
[35:46] and he says here same but man the same
[35:49] silver page 126. and he says here
[35:52] definitely as long as that was one name
[35:56] has never yet been declared in Earth
[35:59] Christ had the stator and intercession
[36:01] to make in to take care of that name as
[36:06] soon as that final name has been sliced
[36:09] into the Clorox or Bleach then his
[36:13] intercession day were over in other
[36:15] words as soon as that person recognized
[36:18] this message I didn't recognize that
[36:20] calling God I didn't interception there
[36:22] for that individual is over and his name
[36:25] had been declared in heaven
[36:28] we're talking about a revelation now
[36:30] we're talking about it so we talk about
[36:32] here we talk about it uh falling from
[36:34] the power position now I want you to
[36:36] know here we preach all the time I know
[36:38] there's a lot of them you know and
[36:39] especially in the message
[36:42] we deal with thoughts on you know he's
[36:44] calling my name yeah
[36:46] all the seven still call your name
[36:48] Hollywood does but the point of it is we
[36:51] must know what he called our name right
[36:53] how did y'all begin to realize here I
[36:55] mean I want you to notice here I read
[36:57] like Isaiah so I want you to know that's
[36:59] the name that was given unto Satan when
[37:02] Lutherville fell he changed his name and
[37:05] brought him down according to a
[37:07] revelation a revelation 12 verse 7
[37:10] through uh 12 verse 7 due to 12th
[37:14] chapter verse 7 through verse 12 he said
[37:17] he said that was the war in heaven
[37:20] and his angels fought against the dragon
[37:23] and and the dragon fault and his angels
[37:28] and Prevail not neither would that place
[37:32] found any more in hell what did
[37:36] something that took place and it's not
[37:38] playing so that was a power in heaven
[37:41] have an anointed in heaven called
[37:42] Lucifer and the Bible said he was
[37:45] created perfect until that means a time
[37:49] that means it will be a path that he
[37:52] would show his color because God could
[37:54] not give him eternal life and if God
[37:56] would have gave the devil eternal life
[37:58] then God couldn't have never Discord him
[38:00] right
[38:01] but Lucifer was created perfect yeah
[38:03] until now
[38:05] something was in him right
[38:07] right something was found in him until
[38:09] what was found himself will have
[38:12] self-esteem he wanted to be more than
[38:14] God how did he would create a perfect
[38:16] until he wanted to be worship like God
[38:19] he wanted to be looked up as God and
[38:21] then sir would you came to mystery of a
[38:23] dignity was found in here how did he
[38:25] would create prayer in other words so
[38:27] now here he is dealing with him he said
[38:29] there was no faith found in heaven
[38:32] right anymore
[38:34] and the dragon was cast out
[38:37] now what you didn't notice here the
[38:39] dragon the dragon was cast out that old
[38:43] serpent right
[38:45] called the devil
[38:47] and Satan
[38:49] and say to which deceived the whole
[38:51] world he was cast out into the Earth and
[38:54] his Angel would cast out with him and I
[38:58] heard a voice saying in heaven
[39:00] now is conservation is great end up
[39:05] king of our God and the power of His of
[39:09] his Christ for the accused of my brother
[39:12] is cast down and killed them before God
[39:16] night and day Hallelujah and they
[39:19] overcame and they overcame him by the
[39:22] blood of the lamb and by the word of the
[39:25] of the testimony and they love
[39:29] and assure you if you notice you're like
[39:31] Brother Sam said if you know it he was
[39:33] because he was cast down and he came up
[39:36] the serpent he came down to the devil
[39:39] but you know that that mystery was they
[39:41] didn't never say Beast right exactly
[39:43] that was a mystery right there now God
[39:46] damn what he said there was a mystery
[39:47] laying there how did all this was
[39:49] spiritual forms he moved he was moving
[39:51] her but he had to Incarnate himself how
[39:54] do you had to become a beast how he
[39:56] could not interject himself into the
[39:58] human race in a spirit form but when he
[40:01] became a beast come on didn't God change
[40:05] his body
[40:06] you know the bees got the first body
[40:09] chain how do you change them from an
[40:10] upright creature to a serpent until he
[40:12] crawled on those ground like a snake how
[40:14] do you show you another word so we begin
[40:16] to realize here so we fighting him
[40:18] falling he had a name and he had a name
[40:21] that he could he had a name of death was
[40:23] in him and I want you to let you know
[40:25] today that what God is trying to show
[40:27] God he didn't if you own the Lamb of the
[40:30] life how do you will find your name in
[40:32] the word how did God you must find your
[40:35] name in the scripture
[40:39] I looked at this here and he said
[40:41] brother Joy I'm talking about names for
[40:43] a second
[40:44] how do you the power is your name
[40:47] hardly the power is behind you
[40:49] Hallelujah you know the word Shall We
[40:51] Begin to look at I want you to notice
[40:53] just real quick as we begin to go in
[40:54] other words Shall We Begin to look I'm
[40:57] talking about calling your name and then
[40:59] we're looking for a fail he moved from
[41:01] his position and the Bible says anyway
[41:04] he he said you are falling from Heaven
[41:06] and the word Greek means uh falling
[41:10] means they forsaken or being removed
[41:14] Hallelujah you all been falling from
[41:17] Heaven and the way you have been you
[41:19] have forsaken Lucifer and you have been
[41:22] removed amen hallelujah in other words
[41:24] so something type play I'm gonna tie
[41:26] this scripture with today we're here he
[41:28] would say whether people start falling
[41:30] from how did where do they fall today
[41:32] how do they have to have some plan in
[41:35] the scripture they fall from
[41:36] I want you to tell me you said when I've
[41:39] been in message a long time but some
[41:41] people have been around for Europe and
[41:43] they have been falling at least
[41:45] something took place
[41:48] he said father I want you to look at
[41:50] them two words
[41:51] falling
[41:53] Forsaken and been removed
[41:56] it got to be scripture that tied to that
[41:58] right because remember brother I said
[42:00] everything he does it always has
[42:02] scripture to tied to it because he
[42:04] preached the Bible
[42:05] he said when the sins was open the Bible
[42:07] became a new book Hallelujah if you
[42:10] can't find yourself in the scripture
[42:12] Hallelujah and the way you cannot find
[42:14] yourself in the Bible how there's
[42:16] something is wrong with your Revelation
[42:17] he said if you read the Bible and do not
[42:20] see Jesus Christ from Jesus the
[42:22] Revelation he said read it over because
[42:24] you have missed your name right I knew
[42:26] that would have happened
[42:28] let's take a look so let me get into
[42:31] looking I'm gonna stop there for a
[42:32] minute and begin to look at just
[42:34] Forsaken and falling
[42:37] Forsaken and removed a name that's been
[42:40] removed a name that's been Fallen
[42:42] Elizabeth has fallen Hallelujah been
[42:44] finally got when he fell from Christ God
[42:47] removed his name Hallelujah you say
[42:49] brother let us look at it and let us
[42:51] look at this
[42:52] look of a scripture to fit that right
[42:55] there and then I did I found it in
[42:57] Hebrews
[42:58] and look at Hebrews 10.
[43:03] Hebrews 10 and let us look at the word
[43:06] forsaken
[43:08] and removed
[43:10] so now I want you to notice here Hebrews
[43:13] 10
[43:15] Hebrews 10 and they begin to read in
[43:17] verse 25.
[43:19] Hebrews 10 verse 25 it says these were
[43:22] not for what
[43:24] not forsaken Hallelujah in other words
[43:27] because now he's in a way you would have
[43:30] found your position in the word not
[43:32] forsaken to the symbolize self together
[43:34] as a matter of some some who if that
[43:38] name would have been in the book they
[43:40] would have been in The Fellowship of the
[43:41] word you could not make the Rapture
[43:44] without a preacher right honey because
[43:46] God got to have skin on him now
[43:48] Hallelujah
[43:50] I know where we got we got a lot of
[43:52] mechanical advices but that still is not
[43:54] God provided way how did that if you
[43:57] ain't got nothing but a tape recorder
[43:58] and that's all you could use God order
[44:00] that but if you've got a man of God that
[44:03] preaching the word of God and they're
[44:04] trying to get you ready for Rapture you
[44:06] need to be here and be cool I'm a fresh
[44:08] an ordinary sir
[44:12] here's another sickness as a matter of
[44:14] son but exalting one another so much and
[44:17] more as we see today approaching for if
[44:19] we should sin willfully
[44:26] if you know that he takes the type of
[44:29] Luther and he said what happened in the
[44:32] day of Wesley and Luther he said uh in
[44:35] the lutherans refused to go on and
[44:38] become father impregnated with the word
[44:40] of God and God moved himself and left
[44:43] the Luther name when you come here you
[44:46] refuse and you refuse to come to the
[44:48] word I refuse to come and be washed
[44:51] under the word of the hour because we
[44:52] all get spirits on us yeah
[45:04] but some people leave and they never get
[45:07] rid of the spirit
[45:08] amen we get sweaty we have to take a
[45:12] bath that's just the bottom line and if
[45:15] you don't think about the people's in
[45:16] church gonna be talking about you
[45:18] ain't nobody gonna be one to hug you I
[45:21] mean that's just the way it is and you
[45:23] know they know where they won't have
[45:25] nothing personally against you but smell
[45:26] yeah
[45:51] refusing to come in under the atmosphere
[45:54] of a god-sent man and be washed into
[45:57] words something is wrong
[46:02] the knowledge of the truth that remain
[46:05] no more sacrifice for sin he said God
[46:08] give the knowledge is a prophet
[46:12] and when we got God knowledge so we
[46:15] refuse the ministry catches the same
[46:18] mind that was in the prophet and he
[46:20] takes that word he said no he ministers
[46:23] we're breaking down like the other night
[46:25] here Brad said a lot of things Sam goes
[46:29] back take those nuggets he brought under
[46:31] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and
[46:34] begin to break down service so you can
[46:36] see your position how do God anyways
[46:39] preacher yeah my brother man left a job
[46:42] for the bride to do we're a man with the
[46:45] Holy Ghost had been sent to get a bride
[46:47] already he got the ability to go in the
[46:49] word of God and break it down
[46:51] Hallelujah sir brother he got ability to
[46:55] break the word down not just a man that
[46:57] would just say it a man just got it it
[46:59] is God is fine I'm gonna go out and do
[47:01] it but Amanda got a call good gift and
[47:03] we'll come up under the same anointed on
[47:05] the prophetic insight and we'll be able
[47:07] to break the message
[47:12] Hallelujah it was the same women that
[47:14] receive the knowledge of the truth that
[47:16] remaining no more sacrifice for sin
[47:19] somebody can be removed
[47:21] so he goes on here and says him but hey
[47:25] certain field for looking
[47:27] of the judgment and of our Indian Nation
[47:30] we shall divide the adversary he that
[47:33] despises Moses now he's putting the word
[47:37] behind the skin of the prophet he that
[47:40] despise his Moses out he told all this
[47:42] now go there and let you know it was
[47:44] under the influence of a prophet that
[47:46] their name is going to be removed how
[47:48] did he that despises Moses uh Moses low
[47:53] died without Mercy death under two or
[47:56] three Witnesses so we gotta realize him
[47:58] so now we come into the conclusion how
[48:01] to work God name is
[48:03] how they said we begin to realize here
[48:04] so I want to uh maybe drop back for a
[48:07] few minutes the Bible teaches us here
[48:09] and brother man tell us he said the
[48:11] seventh seal called our name
[48:13] how do you call your name I believe you
[48:16] recognize your position in the word
[48:18] right do you recognize that I'm a part
[48:20] of God and once you recognize where you
[48:23] come from you know where you're going
[48:24] all right I mean if you come from God
[48:27] you must go back to God I need so once
[48:29] you recognize you come from God and it
[48:32] gives you a peace of mind I'm going back
[48:34] to God
[48:35] but the problem made today people just
[48:37] up and down on this Merry-Go-Round back
[48:39] trying to find out who they are
[48:42] right
[48:45] right and just take it here
[48:46] I'm gonna deal with a few minutes
[48:49] I'm calling your name
[48:51] for just a few minutes
[48:53] How will I know and recognize my name is
[48:55] in heaven
[48:56] because your name cannot be removed
[48:59] right you ever thought about that your
[49:01] name cannot be removed and you but you
[49:03] got to recognize how do who I am
[49:06] Hallelujah and how you gonna recognize
[49:08] who you because you're gonna recognize
[49:10] in your heart that's a desire for God
[49:13] I don't care what it takes I got a
[49:15] design for God how did I might be I
[49:18] might not be what I want to be but I
[49:19] know one thing I'm not whatever used to
[49:21] be and God's still working on me
[49:22] Hallelujah but the point of a deal we
[49:25] must find here on God call your name
[49:29] I'm gonna look in the scripture and see
[49:31] can we find that real quick I looked in
[49:33] the scripture here let us go to Saint
[49:35] John 6.
[49:39] Saint John 6.
[49:44] sixth chapter of Saint John let me find
[49:46] that real quick
[49:47] and I'm not going to read all this
[49:49] I'm gonna deal with I'm gonna deal with
[49:52] uh this group that's coming out

[50:16] testimony of these guys that come out

[50:22] desert
[50:24] and it is written he gave them bread
[50:27] from Heaven to eat
[50:29] then Jesus said unto him unto them Burly
[50:32] verily I said to you Moses
[50:35] Moses gave you not that bread from
[50:38] heaven but my father gave you the true
[50:41] bread from heaven now I'm gonna drop
[50:43] down the same time here so Jesus began
[50:46] to deal with it here they was craving
[50:48] the name of a prophet Moses David said
[50:52] I'm identify myself under Moses the part
[50:56] of it was they never crossed over Jordan
[50:58] no come on they never went over into the
[51:01] promised land because if they would have
[51:03] they would have been sent Joshua and the
[51:06] one that put us in our place how to
[51:08] position replace the people today we got
[51:11] a group of people that run the message
[51:12] all they can say wait when brother
[51:14] Brandon come back I waited no it ain't
[51:16] brother it gonna be the anointing of
[51:18] Joshua the Holy Ghost I'm on your pastor
[51:21] and he gonna take the word and he's
[51:23] gonna positionally place you in the word
[51:25] hallelujah amen
[51:29] so Jesus began to deal with him and he
[51:31] says here
[51:32] Saint John still six I'm gonna begin I'm
[51:35] gonna read a few personalities because I
[51:37] want you to see them
[51:39] and Jesus said I am the I am the bread
[51:42] of life
[51:46] he did not didn't know how to fight they
[51:49] did
[51:51] your father didn't matter in the
[51:53] wilderness and now what
[51:56] right dead a name that's eternally
[51:59] separated with God anyway he giving them
[52:03] a name he'll father did do this but they
[52:07] are dead the name that's on them is
[52:09] death he would say they are eternally
[52:12] separated from God why because they did
[52:16] not go all the way with the words
[52:19] and he says him
[52:21] he said this is the bread which came
[52:24] down from heaven that it that a man may
[52:27] eat of and die and not die I am the
[52:33] living bread which came down from heaven
[52:34] If any man eat up this of this bread he
[52:37] shall live for what
[52:39] and the bread what that I get will give
[52:43] is my flesh which I would give for the
[52:46] life of the world so Jesus is dealing
[52:48] with her now he did he he's telling him
[52:51] this year he's trying he's contacting
[52:53] him and he's calling him by name
[52:56] if you notice right here he's taking the
[52:58] scripture and he's going to call that
[53:00] name
[53:01] and he says here and the Jews don't
[53:03] among themselves saying who can
[53:06] who can just who can this man give us
[53:09] his flesh to eat and Jesus said unto
[53:11] unto them forever I say unto you except
[53:14] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[53:16] drink and drink his blood you have no
[53:19] life in you honey so he's I'm not going
[53:21] to explain this to you I didn't because
[53:23] if it's Revelation it will catch your
[53:25] attention how these people here did you
[53:28] count on mine they trying to figure this
[53:30] thing out
[53:33] drinking my blood has eternal life and I
[53:36] will raise him up at the last day for my
[53:39] pleasure to meet indeed and my blood is
[53:41] drinking either eating my flesh and
[53:43] drinking my blood dwelling in me and I
[53:46] am
[53:47] Hallelujah he's going on here he's he's
[53:50] telling him this tell him dropping on
[53:52] that girl since the same time now the
[53:54] verse 59 he said these days he he said
[53:57] in the in the synagogue as he kind of
[54:00] Capone it many of his disciples when
[54:02] they heard this
[54:04] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[54:08] now he's dealing with the ability to put
[54:10] him there
[54:11] because in other words they are
[54:13] testifying and they can hear the word or
[54:16] if they cannot hear the word they're
[54:17] going to tell you where you come from
[54:19] Hallelujah we say Open the Eyes of My
[54:21] Heart that mean to understand it how do
[54:24] you do another word your eyes that you
[54:25] see where don't let you know God how do
[54:28] they saw Jesus that they came out of the
[54:29] two Mary stood there and she was married
[54:32] but but the leader I think went down to
[54:34] the Tomb of Jesus looked at him with a
[54:36] natural eye he was a young man she could
[54:38] not identify who he was so our eyes in
[54:41] the Physical Realm could not open or
[54:44] reveal to what we want but when he
[54:46] called up our name Hallelujah when he
[54:48] called him my name she knew who he was
[54:50] amen that personal Revolution she was
[54:54] able to hear his voice
[54:57] and he says here so they said we can
[54:59] hear it and when Jesus knew in himself
[55:04] that the disciples moment he said unto
[55:06] them just offend you
[55:08] see that what the people did that's
[55:10] what's wrong today you try to preach the
[55:12] Revelation until you're trying to preach
[55:13] Christ and the people get offended oh
[55:16] man I ain't gonna do I ain't gonna put
[55:19] up with that who you getting offended
[55:21] with yeah if if something if the word of
[55:24] God could offend you and run you off is
[55:26] something wrong with your call
[55:28] well I want to tell you Jesus Jesus
[55:31] those things that didn't offend people
[55:33] yeah oh
[55:38] that's right now there go your name
[55:41] right
[55:42] okay okay huh
[55:45] I've done something wrong okay okay okay
[55:48] okay okay okay because okay
[55:55] so you know so you know what I'm trying
[55:58] to say here is that you know when Jesus
[56:00] was saying that he defend Jesus love
[56:03] said they to throw peoples off what you
[56:05] think Jeter would do it when he was
[56:07] dealing with this woman whose name was
[56:09] on the Lamb of the life and she could
[56:11] not be thrown out or be offended when
[56:13] Jesus turned around in that day and said
[56:16] the bread is for the children not your
[56:18] dog to call somebody that time adult was
[56:21] a disgrace oh yeah right it ain't like
[56:23] it is today that come on that's a modern
[56:24] word what's up dog
[56:30] hey what's up dog I mean I'm not a dog
[56:37] Bobby tell me to be one dogs
[56:39] I'm the only kind of dog I got is hot
[56:41] dogs I don't deal with nothing else
[56:44] begin to realize here or you know people
[56:47] don't mind you calling my dog if you
[56:49] call him a big dog yeah was
[57:03] right to decide to say get rid of her
[57:05] yeah they would want this Gentile woman
[57:08] to get out of the way she was Lord an
[57:10] adult before they were concerned and he
[57:12] called her adult hoping that she would
[57:15] just go on and leave but representation
[57:21] she knew a place in the scripture she
[57:24] knew that she was coming to get
[57:25] something from God she said Lord that's
[57:28] right right if you want to call me a dog
[57:30] you will but I'm not leaving I'm not
[57:33] going to leave till I get the clowns
[57:35] that fall for the master table her faith
[57:37] was perseverance that did not come by
[57:40] home will but they came by the will of
[57:42] God that was in her amen
[57:44] but he said does this offend you
[57:47] and if yay shall see the son of man a
[57:50] sinner what he was before then he go to
[57:53] the end of the spirit that quicker right
[57:55] right now he let him know you ain't
[57:57] gonna get this by looking at me
[57:59] you won't have to get this by revelation
[58:01] you want to deal with this Revelation
[58:03] through the spirit realm going fishing
[58:05] with me don't give you a revelation how
[58:07] they're going hunting with me didn't
[58:08] give you this Revelation one of Jesus
[58:11] belt buckle didn't help you Hallelujah
[58:13] that's all right but that ain't what
[58:15] y'all to me he said this is the thing
[58:16] that's spiritually deserved how do you
[58:18] say it is the spirit and quicker to
[58:20] flesh Prophet nothing and that when
[58:22] people still trying to get the flesh
[58:24] ready and ought to be they ought to be
[58:26] trying to get the soul ready and the
[58:28] Soul get ready by the hearing the
[58:30] preaching of the word over and over and
[58:32] over
[58:34] hey he's at the flood Prophet nothing
[58:37] but the words of us because you there
[58:38] are Spirit left in our life
[58:41] now Jesus I want you to notice here
[58:43] he's calling
[58:45] so now he's going to identify
[58:48] he's telling them there's some of you
[58:51] that name is going to be removed today
[58:54] he knew there was going to be some names
[58:56] removed today he said but there are some
[58:59] of you that believe not
[59:01] Jesus was not deceived the word is not
[59:03] deceived
[59:05] he said there's some of you they've been
[59:08] going to church with me
[59:09] I gave power to do this but yet still
[59:12] you don't believe me right he said
[59:14] there's some of you that believe not and
[59:16] Jesus knew from the what
[59:18] who they were that believe not and who
[59:22] shall betray him so he was not deceived
[59:25] by the by the one that was going to
[59:27] betray him the word has spiritually
[59:30] discerned the enemy and then we're here
[59:33] the one they deceived him he hadn't
[59:36] called his name yet I want you to know
[59:37] that the one that we could deceive them
[59:39] he stayed right with them they could not
[59:42] identify it was Judas that was going to
[59:45] betray him how did Jesus never told him
[59:47] that even when he said this they did not
[59:49] even know who he was even when the
[59:52] angels went up to worship before God
[59:54] Satan showed up
[59:56] Jesus was the only one that knew who he
[59:58] was he was so religious that even the
[1:00:01] angels didn't know we were right he said
[1:00:03] say what you going man what you doing I
[1:00:05] need anywhere so we that way take the
[1:00:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:09] how did they deal with religious power
[1:00:11] that we fight against today I mean it
[1:00:13] ain't the point of it is it ain't the it
[1:00:15] ain't the man down there drinking and
[1:00:17] smoking ain't gonna deal with you it's
[1:00:19] going to be the oldest setting your own
[1:00:20] ring that come Anointed with this
[1:00:22] message and turn around to be trainers
[1:00:26] the truth
[1:00:28] and Jesus said right here he says here
[1:00:31] he knew from that he knew he was going
[1:00:33] to do this job trying to find my place
[1:00:37] 64. okay yeah I'm 64. he said now some
[1:00:40] of you he said uh some of you of you
[1:00:42] that believe nothing you knew from the
[1:00:44] beginning of who they were that believe
[1:00:45] not and who should betray him and he
[1:00:48] said therefore I say unto you that no
[1:00:51] man can come unto me except it was given
[1:00:54] unto him of my father
[1:01:15] so there was only choices of time
[1:01:19] there was only children's of time they
[1:01:20] had a period of time that they were
[1:01:23] going to manifest what was on the inside
[1:01:24] of them Hallelujah he said from that
[1:01:27] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:01:30] won't know more with him Saint John 6 6
[1:01:36] 6. he removed their name from The Book
[1:01:40] of Life
[1:01:41] how did anyone he took that name off
[1:01:44] then he goes on and says here and he
[1:01:46] done this
[1:01:47] turned to me Invasion the 67 brother and
[1:01:51] Jesus said unto the 12th well yeah also
[1:01:53] go yeah right yeah
[1:01:56] this is representation
[1:01:59] Peter might not know it but his name was
[1:02:00] there how did Peter might not know his
[1:02:03] name was there how do you say and then
[1:02:06] Simon Peter as
[1:02:09] a lord
[1:02:12] to whom shall we go
[1:02:15] yeah to have the words of eternal life
[1:02:17] Hallelujah I want to tell you that they
[1:02:19] find me a place right that preached
[1:02:21] Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:24] who shall we go I don't understand that
[1:02:27] but I know that you are the Christ
[1:02:28] Hallelujah in other words and Weaver and
[1:02:31] we believe it we are sure that God of
[1:02:33] Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:02:35] Jesus as it is hell not our chosen right
[1:02:45] clever you
[1:02:48] and then when I told trouble you
[1:02:50] but one of you is eternally separated
[1:02:53] had I chosen travel you and one of you
[1:02:58] is a
[1:02:59] a name that cannot be redeemed right he
[1:03:02] didn't call him he called he that way if
[1:03:05] you notice he immediately identified how
[1:03:07] to one of you in the incarnated devil
[1:03:11] why did Jesus know that Judas would not
[1:03:14] be saved because judah's name said the
[1:03:17] sign of prediction
[1:03:20] right
[1:03:23] but he had to run his course
[1:03:26] he knew what he went all the way up to
[1:03:27] the end of it but he could not go to
[1:03:29] Pentecost his job was if Judy would have
[1:03:32] made it to Pentagon the devil would have
[1:03:33] got to say
[1:03:34] he would have got to say but God knew he
[1:03:37] was gonna go to Pentagon and before
[1:03:39] Pentacles come that was a place in Judah
[1:03:42] that the devil could come down and
[1:03:44] become the incarnated Beast man exactly
[1:03:47] Hallelujah he's old brother yes sir so
[1:03:51] we began to go here he called that name
[1:03:54] and he called their name you said
[1:03:56] brother someone I'm trying to say your
[1:03:58] name is what position replace you
[1:03:59] Hallelujah now we begin to go and look
[1:04:01] at him for a few more minutes
[1:04:03] we find him the problem with Dylan and
[1:04:05] he was showing her in other words those
[1:04:08] names in the how important names is in
[1:04:10] the church that book on page a 266 he
[1:04:13] said he said we will also show that
[1:04:16] there is a group of people whose name
[1:04:18] have been placed on the record before
[1:04:20] the foundation of the world
[1:04:23] cannot
[1:04:25] under any circumstance
[1:04:27] have those names removed amen he said
[1:04:31] well I can do what I want to do that's a
[1:04:32] good sign that you're not there hell if
[1:04:35] you want to go out and do the things of
[1:04:36] the world and then and then where the
[1:04:38] job was seen like Brother Sam we were
[1:04:40] talking about that too many people got
[1:04:41] predestination mixed up they got to
[1:04:44] preach if I'm predestinated it don't
[1:04:46] matter if I drink smoke or go out and
[1:04:48] come in a Dodger Hallelujah I'm
[1:04:49] predestinated to be there no you're not
[1:04:51] predestinated how did they go out drink
[1:04:53] and smoke and run around you are
[1:04:56] predestinated for one purpose to be
[1:04:58] conformed into the image of the Living
[1:05:00] God your life must become Christ
[1:05:19] don't know how those days removed
[1:05:22] but we will also show that there's
[1:05:24] another group of names who's on the on
[1:05:26] that record book before the foundation
[1:05:28] of the world will have their names
[1:05:30] removed
[1:05:33] something went wrong somewhere
[1:05:35] show you this they're gonna be two vines
[1:05:37] in the same one coming out the same
[1:05:39] holiday I intermingle together but one
[1:05:42] name cannot be removed under any
[1:05:44] circumstance and there's another name
[1:05:46] that can be removed and you said brother
[1:05:48] that is real confusing oh yes it is if
[1:05:51] you don't have a revelation right
[1:05:54] see Judas not only did Judas I want you
[1:05:57] to understand here 272 in the church
[1:06:00] here but man says here that Judas did
[1:06:02] and like Judas they did not all he he
[1:06:05] did not all the way
[1:06:07] he did not know the way so how Judas was
[1:06:11] chosen of God he was instructed in truth
[1:06:13] he shared the knowledge of the mystery
[1:06:16] and people said all I got to do is know
[1:06:18] the Mysteries that's good that's just
[1:06:22] the first six seals of it right right
[1:06:24] but the seven sealed of Christ himself I
[1:06:27] didn't know in the mystery and knowing
[1:06:28] Christ that's what Paul was saying no
[1:06:30] you can understand all mystery and not
[1:06:33] have the person
[1:06:34] Hallelujah so that people take the
[1:06:36] mystery for the new birth how did the
[1:06:39] new bird brings you to the life of Jesus
[1:06:41] Christ Living on this side of you it
[1:06:44] must become the mystery must become
[1:06:46] flesh amen he says right here and he
[1:06:50] said right here I'm not gonna be all day
[1:06:55] he shared the knowledge of the mystery
[1:06:58] he had a Ministry of power granted under
[1:07:00] him he he healed the sick and cast out
[1:07:03] devils in Jesus name how there was no
[1:07:07] other name demon could leave here he had
[1:07:09] enough uh no doubt he had an
[1:07:12] intellectual faith if I used his name
[1:07:13] Demon's going to leave how do you show
[1:07:15] you that but when The Showdown came he
[1:07:18] he sold out his he sold out for gold and
[1:07:21] politic power he did not go up to
[1:07:24] Pentecost to receive the Holy Ghost he
[1:07:26] showed that his name could be removed
[1:07:32] what about all those other people that
[1:07:35] was with Jesus what happened to that
[1:07:37] whole group why they was not in Pinnacle
[1:07:39] but a whole 120. you're right all right
[1:07:42] all right exactly something went wrong
[1:07:45] maybe the pressure must have shut them
[1:07:47] off the word fell into the heart didn't
[1:07:50] say come to ease here come the evil one
[1:07:52] and started out at heart because if the
[1:07:54] world would have stayed in their heart
[1:07:55] they would have been in Upper Room maybe
[1:07:57] maybe 5 000 should have went there right
[1:07:59] all the people that see need Miracles
[1:08:01] that Jesus did they ought to be in the
[1:08:03] upper room but what happened the wedding
[1:08:06] been stolen on that heart right
[1:08:08] oh Hallelujah so we begin to go and look
[1:08:11] at this here let us look here I'm
[1:08:13] talking about names for a second
[1:08:15] a name that cannot be removed
[1:08:18] I look it up because you study this here
[1:08:21] I'm standing this right here Abraham
[1:08:23] this is just maybe on the scope of
[1:08:25] Abraham
[1:08:26] Abraham could have been you know like
[1:08:28] Abraham himself if you read Abraham
[1:08:31] commentary
[1:08:33] and read about the Old Testament about
[1:08:34] Abraham you will find out that Abraham
[1:08:38] has some issues Abraham has the missions
[1:08:40] right the man has some issues I mean you
[1:08:43] know he he had a little light he didn't
[1:08:45] even if impression come down he he told
[1:08:47] little while yeah
[1:08:49] you know I mean he did I mean and we
[1:08:52] know the story how Abraham took Hagar
[1:08:54] and took this woman out of wedlock
[1:08:56] impregnated with a child that produces
[1:08:59] Ishmael or illegitimate child hallelu in
[1:09:02] other words
[1:09:04] Abraham did not if Abraham if Abram
[1:09:07] would have been in church today if we
[1:09:09] would have somebody would told us that
[1:09:10] he was the father of the faith we would
[1:09:12] have went right back to his past life
[1:09:13] he'd known to my father
[1:09:16] foreign
[1:09:24] got to be kidding oh man I didn't want
[1:09:27] to be around that man he told me the
[1:09:28] father of Fate man I got that little
[1:09:30] wild boy right there playing rock and
[1:09:32] roll music
[1:09:34] even though it was Wild by Nature so you
[1:09:37] know we begin to go and look at this
[1:09:38] Earth so we look at all these things
[1:09:39] Abraham did and only they did he did in
[1:09:42] other words but the part of it was God
[1:09:45] called Abraham out of a place of a a
[1:09:48] place of adultery he caught about a
[1:09:51] place of paganism how to call Abraham
[1:09:53] his uh his father household how to come
[1:09:57] to a land that I'll show you how do
[1:09:59] there was something that was
[1:10:00] predestinated something that was for
[1:10:02] knowledge about God say Abraham leave
[1:10:04] your home right
[1:10:08] all that mess
[1:10:11] in other words he'll go ahead and come
[1:10:12] out following God halfway believing
[1:10:15] brother McCann peoples alone he should
[1:10:17] have been by himself because I got to
[1:10:20] get your way in the word you got to
[1:10:21] separate from every day how did your
[1:10:23] Revelation separate you from everything
[1:10:24] I did a lot of time me we let people
[1:10:27] talk with that or be uh people talk
[1:10:30] outside of it Hallelujah it doesn't want
[1:10:32] to solve it if my mama don't go on him
[1:10:34] to me if my daddy don't go to him to me
[1:10:36] I'd have made up my mind I'm going all
[1:10:38] the way with God how do you got to make
[1:10:40] up your run and it ain't about you or
[1:10:42] your husband it's about you and God
[1:10:44] hallelujah I believe that we ought to do
[1:10:47] our best to live together and peace but
[1:10:49] when they come down to Jesus Christ then
[1:10:51] when we draw the line here we've got the
[1:10:53] hell somewhere to draw the line
[1:10:55] yes sir
[1:10:57] it goes and says right here so we get we
[1:11:00] begin to look
[1:11:01] so God gives him a promise
[1:11:04] tell him he gonna have a child
[1:11:06] but he already had a child
[1:11:08] oh Ishmael
[1:11:16] and according to the law the firstborn
[1:11:19] was entitled to the birthright
[1:11:21] Hallelujah so ain't gonna have to be
[1:11:23] something that's gonna have to be done
[1:11:25] because now he's caught in a
[1:11:26] predicamentally the firstborn Ishmael is
[1:11:30] the son that was entitled to the
[1:11:31] birthright but God had a plan how did
[1:11:34] God had a plan he wanted to show the
[1:11:36] Heart of Jesus Christ
[1:11:39] got it at least so God does something
[1:11:41] different to Abraham he turned around
[1:11:43] not called him Abram but changed his
[1:11:46] name now what's his name would change
[1:11:49] his body could change
[1:11:51] his past life was done away with him so
[1:11:55] now with Paul get the mind of God he
[1:11:57] sees Abraham he said Abraham stopping
[1:12:00] out at the promise
[1:12:03] giving God glory and giving God prey
[1:12:05] when his body was dead said Wu was dead
[1:12:08] her name was changed God put the H in
[1:12:10] his books of himself in them he put
[1:12:15] and through this Abraham body was able
[1:12:17] to have a body check now I want you to
[1:12:20] notice here
[1:12:21] well God looked at Abraham he never saw
[1:12:24] Abrams
[1:12:26] he never saw Abraham because Abram was
[1:12:30] done away with
[1:12:31] that name was done away with it when he
[1:12:34] looked at Abra he saw Abraham honey he
[1:12:37] saw him under another Covenant how do
[1:12:39] you say Abraham now I'm gonna get a boat
[1:12:42] right to the right side
[1:12:44] I'm not even mentioned Israel but all by
[1:12:47] either you're only
[1:12:50] well that's all right
[1:12:52] I thank God to your only son but what
[1:12:54] about him he would not even count it he
[1:12:57] might have been counted under Abram
[1:12:59] under your first Union under the devil
[1:13:01] might have this on your life and you
[1:13:03] might have done it but when God save you
[1:13:04] he gave you a new name and if God don't
[1:13:07] see your own book the point of it is we
[1:13:10] can't get rid of it we still digging up
[1:13:12] a dick oh I've done so many of us if
[1:13:15] you've got a true Revelation you got a
[1:13:17] name change
[1:13:20] Hallelujah
[1:13:22] tell me we're going to look at him
[1:13:24] there's another I'm gonna put my
[1:13:27] parachute on now so hold on
[1:13:29] another one got to preach at two o'clock
[1:13:33] listen I my boy's getting to feel a
[1:13:35] little scratchy
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:38] amen but here we are we're looking God
[1:13:42] deal with people here's what God dealing
[1:13:44] with it here he was dealing with Jacob
[1:13:46] how did what did it mean the name means
[1:13:48] to planner a little deceiver and Jacob
[1:13:52] did all these things he deceived Esau he
[1:13:55] deceited he deceived and follow he had a
[1:13:57] bad a title behind his name and he could
[1:14:00] not be coming in power position with God
[1:14:02] under the name of Jacob so God Rising
[1:14:06] with him and changed his name from Jacob
[1:14:09] to Israel oppressed with God and it
[1:14:12] didn't begin to Prevail right
[1:14:16] Peter did not have a good testimony
[1:14:21] you read about Peter his testimony was
[1:14:24] not really that good
[1:14:26] not invite Peter had a little issue
[1:14:27] Jesus knew he had a little issues
[1:14:30] you know Jesus deal when one time come
[1:14:31] down into the lake down in naked
[1:14:33] swimming yeah I don't know what his
[1:14:35] problem was
[1:14:36] Hallelujah Peter walk around with an
[1:14:39] attitude anything go down you don't have
[1:14:42] to worry about me I got your back yeah
[1:14:43] yeah that's the way his attitude was and
[1:14:46] Jesus knew this dude you know you know
[1:14:48] what you know what Gina wouldn't he
[1:14:50] didn't judge him he just knew that he
[1:14:51] needed to go to Pentacles to get the
[1:14:52] Holy Ghost
[1:14:53] you know he won them kind of guys you
[1:14:56] know hey I got your back let something
[1:14:59] go down yeah and he proved that man cut
[1:15:01] a man girl
[1:15:03] Jesus said what you doing boy you're
[1:15:06] gonna get everybody killed you didn't
[1:15:07] find out you've done that said you
[1:15:09] didn't put it up by going he didn't
[1:15:10] leave a scar come shoot at me and try to
[1:15:12] show what happened back in the man had
[1:15:14] something wrong
[1:15:16] I mean you you got your ear put back on
[1:15:18] there ain't no scar you talking about a
[1:15:20] man because you are man you need a
[1:15:21] vacation
[1:15:23] honey but in the words of Jesus knew
[1:15:25] that Peter Jesus but also Jesus knew
[1:15:29] that Peter loved him
[1:15:31] that was the thing it was Jesus knew
[1:15:34] that Peter had a love for God hallelujah
[1:15:36] even though his body wouldn't acting
[1:15:38] like it
[1:15:39] yeah
[1:15:41] that was a representation by fortnightly
[1:15:43] he loved God and did Jesus asked him a
[1:15:47] word or two do you love me being a young
[1:15:49] Lord feed my lamb Peter Do It Do You
[1:15:51] Love Me fever she beat it you look wait
[1:15:54] a minute don't you ask me that again
[1:15:57] if you ain't ready yet
[1:16:05] in his heart
[1:16:07] Peter knew
[1:16:09] I'm not uh Peter knew God knew that
[1:16:12] Peter loved him so much that Peter would
[1:16:15] have got in the way yeah
[1:16:17] oh it would have been a problem because
[1:16:19] Peter had attitude I'm not banging down
[1:16:22] yeah so Jesus said man you're gonna mess
[1:16:24] this playing up
[1:16:25] I hate to do you this way buddy but I
[1:16:28] don't have to prophesy with you
[1:16:31] you know in other words you know it
[1:16:33] they're going to play and work it out
[1:16:34] just right and you got Peter there with
[1:16:36] a bad attitude ready to go over these
[1:16:39] guys
[1:16:42] Hallelujah I can go to Calvary by myself
[1:16:44] if not me and you both gonna be hanging
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:48] now we're getting ready to happen so
[1:16:51] Jesus said Peter before the Concord
[1:16:54] three times just said the Lord where's
[1:16:56] what he was saying because it had to
[1:16:58] come to pass right if Gina would have
[1:17:00] spoken and Peter would have never denied
[1:17:02] him it would have been something wrong
[1:17:03] with the prophecy but the word cannot be
[1:17:05] broken so Jesus had to take the word of
[1:17:08] Prophecy and thus said the Lord Peter
[1:17:10] Hallelujah before the conquer you'll
[1:17:13] deny me right Peter thinking what's
[1:17:15] wrong with him
[1:17:16] but he did it
[1:17:18] right he might not realize why he done
[1:17:20] it he done it he didn't have no judgment
[1:17:22] to do it right but Judah denied him by
[1:17:25] choice
[1:17:26] he had a choice to accept Jesus he
[1:17:29] denied him by choice he's pee so that
[1:17:32] but Peter didn't have a choice he had
[1:17:35] prophecy
[1:17:36] so dude don't get don't get it mixed up
[1:17:38] it ain't that Peter this didn't he not I
[1:17:41] hear people say he's a renegade he
[1:17:42] denied Jesus he should have denied Jesus
[1:17:44] prophesied over you to do it that same
[1:17:46] thing you gonna do right Hallelujah it
[1:17:48] ain't nothing else you can do so but the
[1:17:50] point of it is I want you to understand
[1:17:51] something but I want you to know all the
[1:17:54] things that Peter did what you doing oh
[1:17:56] his attitude everything when Jesus
[1:17:58] asking one question who the man said it
[1:18:01] to him and he said he died of Christ are
[1:18:03] you doing some call you this man some
[1:18:06] call your job I didn't begin to go he
[1:18:07] could hold it yeah I did not use second
[1:18:10] hand revelation
[1:18:31] Peter says now to Christ the son of the
[1:18:34] Living God
[1:18:36] and when Peter said this Jesus looked at
[1:18:39] him and said Peter
[1:18:41] change his name
[1:18:43] saying the name to a name they cannot be
[1:18:46] separated from God under any
[1:18:49] circumstance and Peter now he's up on
[1:18:51] this name up on this rock
[1:18:53] which is that little name the name Peter
[1:18:56] mean a little Stone up under this little
[1:18:58] skull about the disc Revelation right
[1:19:00] here I will build my church Hallelujah
[1:19:03] and I will build my church and the Gates
[1:19:06] of Hell will fight it all away but I'm
[1:19:08] gonna let you know under this name right
[1:19:10] here the Gates of Hell shall not be able
[1:19:12] to overcome I mean Peter had it and I'm
[1:19:15] going to give you the keys to my house
[1:19:19] and if you don't make it I ain't gonna
[1:19:21] be able to get in right now
[1:19:25] come once Jesus give me something he
[1:19:27] don't take it back
[1:19:28] how did Jesus don't give you something
[1:19:30] one day and say I want it back to next
[1:19:31] day I'm giving you hell the keys to the
[1:19:34] kingdom of heaven before this boy even
[1:19:35] had the Holy Ghost based up on his
[1:19:38] Revelation that came from God how did
[1:19:41] his Revelation came from God he gave him
[1:19:43] the key based up on Revelation that came
[1:19:46] from God up on this run after it was not
[1:19:49] what Peter was doing in the flesh but
[1:19:50] his Revelation how did that cave of God
[1:19:53] but hold him all the way to the end of
[1:19:55] the world and then I went to your word
[1:19:57] and we know the story here Peter goes
[1:19:59] here he goes here and he rejected Christ
[1:20:02] no doubt falls under the depression sure
[1:20:05] could you reject God you're going to be
[1:20:07] on some depression I'm sure that devil
[1:20:09] probably trying to talk him into
[1:20:10] committing suicide like Judas
[1:20:12] boy you don't mess up buddy
[1:20:15] you know messed up I'll say how you
[1:20:18] gonna make it now but when Jesus come
[1:20:20] out conquered them grave in hell
[1:20:22] I want you to notice he beginning to
[1:20:24] take he he was he told us that go tell
[1:20:26] my disciples
[1:20:28] that I have risen right then he stops he
[1:20:32] said I want to make this a personal
[1:20:33] right and Peter right
[1:20:36] so when Peter heard him that and Peter
[1:20:38] that was enough to let him know how to I
[1:20:42] Believe by the grace of God he know I'm
[1:20:44] going to be there he did something for
[1:20:46] Peter that he never did but Judith he
[1:20:49] prayed for Peter
[1:20:50] he didn't pray that his flesh wouldn't
[1:20:52] get weak he prayed that his faith
[1:20:54] wouldn't fail and if God pray for your
[1:20:56] Revelation I don't care how many Devils
[1:20:58] go I don't care what cup you would never
[1:21:01] separate yourself from revelation
[1:21:03] my last one I'm closing
[1:21:08] you remember him
[1:21:09] Professor a name that couldn't be
[1:21:11] removed
[1:21:12] under any circumstance
[1:21:15] circumstances
[1:21:17] totally had removed
[1:21:20] Paul yeah from the book if we would look
[1:21:24] at it in that way he said brother no sir
[1:21:26] oh yes sir because Paul blasphemed
[1:21:30] against the word
[1:21:31] the Bible Paul said he did right and he
[1:21:34] Deport Paul said I bless him
[1:21:37] but if service death could have removed
[1:21:40] Paul Paul should not have made it
[1:21:43] because he come against a scripture that
[1:21:45] had told anybody to touch not my
[1:21:47] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[1:21:50] right
[1:21:51] and Paul killed Stephen
[1:21:54] if you notice Paul killed Steve
[1:21:56] a man full of the Holy Ghost how did the
[1:21:59] Bible say full of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:00] anointed of God Paul should have been
[1:22:04] scratched off the book right but I want
[1:22:06] to let you know Hallelujah and he would
[1:22:08] have been scratched off the book but his
[1:22:10] name was changed probably his name was
[1:22:13] changed what Saul done he had to do away
[1:22:16] with it and then so with the spirit of
[1:22:18] the Lord called him he did not call
[1:22:20] himself I call you Paul Paul never
[1:22:23] killed Stephenson it was solid kills
[1:22:26] demons but when God called him he
[1:22:28] changes man the same way God call you he
[1:22:32] changed your name amen said here he says
[1:22:37] I don't no longer call you Church
[1:22:40] because I call your brother
[1:22:43] you know he brought him out of Pentecost
[1:22:44] now they was in the courtship
[1:22:46] they became bright
[1:22:48] courtship is is the good
[1:22:51] that's no doubt that's some of the best
[1:22:53] times of you know before life set in
[1:22:57] is the courtship
[1:23:00] because that's when the girls getting
[1:23:01] all the cookies
[1:23:02] he come to the house with the flowers
[1:23:06] she she don't eat much yeah
[1:23:11] yeah it's a type of romance either she
[1:23:13] living on these dumb love letters
[1:23:16] you hear what he's saying wow look at my
[1:23:20] dad
[1:23:21] that's the only thing my girls walked
[1:23:23] around for months with lettuce
[1:23:26] I would look at them and they'd be
[1:23:27] walking through the house
[1:23:30] I sneaked in there and read one of them
[1:23:31] letters
[1:23:36] kitty smell right
[1:23:40] I'm thinking once you all worked up
[1:23:42] about this little I don't see nothing
[1:23:44] but she saw between the lines
[1:23:46] she saw something between the line how
[1:23:49] much is a secret I can see it I'm
[1:23:50] thinking man this guy he got a long way
[1:23:52] to go
[1:23:54] you got eyes like the seven to see you
[1:23:59] you got wings like a eagle
[1:24:02] oh man all these beautiful sands and all
[1:24:05] that did it and under this courtship
[1:24:07] stage stay so called up yeah yeah they
[1:24:11] forget about things
[1:24:13] it's the dumb as your daughter probably
[1:24:16] I'm a kid
[1:24:17] that's when they don't think what they
[1:24:19] put anything I just come home in the
[1:24:21] night ice cream in this microwave
[1:24:25] and I'm thinking what in the world is
[1:24:27] going on with my daughters I walk in the
[1:24:29] room I say who put the ice cream in the
[1:24:32] microwave
[1:24:34] I don't know
[1:24:37] what you mean you don't know I don't
[1:24:40] know how I got there when somebody put
[1:24:41] it there it was not me yeah
[1:24:43] this dumb stuff was happening that was
[1:24:46] under that courtship abroad
[1:24:49] his bride to be she called Brian
[1:24:52] and none of that of course you know it
[1:24:55] just stays like that was happening in my
[1:24:57] house because one of my girls got both
[1:24:58] my girls one of them got married and
[1:25:00] they shouldn't got married so I had two
[1:25:02] dumb daughters at one time
[1:25:12] well I'm so glad boy I said man I told
[1:25:14] my wife they're gonna have to get out
[1:25:17] but anyway so it went on there but under
[1:25:19] that courtship stage
[1:25:21] I'm gonna let you know this I would let
[1:25:23] when that boy would come to his house he
[1:25:26] would come to my house man it was a real
[1:25:28] good cat you know he'll come and pick
[1:25:30] her up and they will go out under that
[1:25:32] courtship and my daughter was losing
[1:25:34] weight like crazy yeah it's my baby girl
[1:25:36] she was already little and she probably
[1:25:37] lost 30 pounds I'm thinking you're gonna
[1:25:40] vanish before you get married
[1:25:42] and uh but anyway she was not even
[1:25:44] eating because under the courtship stage
[1:25:46] it's the best day the guy he carry you
[1:25:49] out to eat and you get to maybe Burger
[1:25:51] King and he said that he said I'm gonna
[1:25:54] buy it I'm gonna buy me a uh whatever
[1:25:56] Big Mac now that's a McDonald a waffle
[1:26:00] is that what you do you want one she'll
[1:26:02] say now
[1:26:04] so you don't just say no I just eat some
[1:26:07] of yours
[1:26:08] and he thinking in his mind
[1:26:11] man this is gonna be easy
[1:26:15] and man she's not expensive at all
[1:26:18] and it's gonna be all right
[1:26:21] hey yeah you got a lot to learn buddy
[1:26:26] here you go down and she'll sit there
[1:26:28] and she'll take a cup of french fries
[1:26:31] you want some mom nah that's all I want
[1:26:33] he oh man I got all this to myself
[1:26:39] but that changes
[1:26:43] what's that word I do
[1:26:46] what's that word I pronounce you man and
[1:26:49] wife
[1:26:50] right then
[1:26:51] God put elected term in her mouth
[1:26:56] do you know I didn't know she like that
[1:27:01] that design thing changes but I want to
[1:27:04] let you know that was under the bride
[1:27:05] that's under the courtship right right
[1:27:07] in other words people's death what
[1:27:09] happened in this day they don't stayed
[1:27:11] under the courtship so long under the
[1:27:13] gifts so long that they didn't go all
[1:27:15] the way into the next room so when the
[1:27:17] boy would come to my house
[1:27:18] my son-in-law would date my daughters
[1:27:20] they I gave him permission they could
[1:27:22] come to my house
[1:27:25] they're not going to do I walked to the
[1:27:26] door
[1:27:27] and he and I remember to engage
[1:27:30] but only he was allowed
[1:27:32] that go in my living room
[1:27:35] and my kitchen
[1:27:37] under bride that's all the underground
[1:27:39] and then she's been his bride to be they
[1:27:42] was only allowed he could come in my
[1:27:44] living room sit there and laugh
[1:27:45] and talk it was no problem
[1:27:47] I invite him to the kitchen and then he
[1:27:51] said in the kitchen we can laugh and
[1:27:52] talk but then Robert said this message
[1:27:54] is a three-room house
[1:27:57] under the under the anointing of bride
[1:27:59] he could not go no further
[1:28:01] but once the veil would lifted
[1:28:04] and he kissed his bride right did he
[1:28:08] could come to my house now he can stay
