[7:11] able to walk in you forgive our sins
[7:14] because we want to be complete have your
[7:16] way in Jesus name
[7:19] amen Revelations 1 and then
[7:22] Revelations
[7:25] 19 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[7:27] God gave unto him
[7:30] to show unto his servants things which
[7:32] must shortly come to pass and he said
[7:34] and signified it by his Angel unto his
[7:36] servant John by record of the word of
[7:39] God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[7:41] and of all things that is saw blessed is
[7:44] he that readeth and they that hear the
[7:45] words of this prophecy and keep those
[7:48] things which are written therein for
[7:49] what for the time is at
[7:53] hand
[7:55] right Revelations 19 we'll jump to verse
[7:58] 11
[8:00] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[8:02] horse and he that set upon him was
[8:04] called faithful and true and in
[8:06] righteousness he that judge and make war
[8:09] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[8:11] his head were many crowns and notice
[8:14] already on his head now we'll try to get
[8:17] to that in a little bit because when it
[8:18] comes to this place the Saints is
[8:20] crowned him right all right now so
[8:22] remember that he had many
[8:25] crowns any name written that no man knew
[8:27] but he himself and he was clothed with a
[8:30] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[8:32] called the word of God and the enemies
[8:35] which were in heaven excuse me and the
[8:37] armies which were in heaven followed him
[8:40] upon white horses clothed and fine linen
[8:42] white and clean and out of his mouth
[8:44] goeth a sharp sword that with it he
[8:47] should Smite the Nations and he should
[8:49] rule them with a rod of iron and he
[8:51] threat the wine price with the
[8:52] fierceness of the wrath of almighty God
[8:56] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[8:57] thigh a name written king of kings and
[9:01] Lord of lords you may be seated the Lord
[9:03] has his Blessing to the reading of the
[9:06] word
[9:08] now we've been trying to get down and
[9:11] you know to a point and like I said we
[9:14] covered over to through the Book of
[9:16] Revelations and spent a lot of
[9:18] time talking about the things that will
[9:21] happen in all like that to the world and
[9:25] the situations of life and tribulation
[9:28] period and and all all kind of things
[9:30] but now we're coming over in more into
[9:34] the Glorious part to be able to talk
[9:36] we've got a couple of spots in here like
[9:38] the white Throne judgment but you know
[9:40] really the white Throne judgment is not
[9:43] a horrible thing if you think of it in
[9:45] the correct order and we'll get to that
[9:47] to try to bring it you say well that's a
[9:50] judgment that's true but there will be
[9:52] people there at that judgment if they've
[9:55] been correct and done right you know
[9:57] they'll be given eternal life right
[9:59] right so it's not you know a horrible
[10:02] thing to think of it's horrible in the
[10:04] fact of what we do and don't do on a lot
[10:06] of it but that's you know we'll get to
[10:08] that but we're over into the Glorious
[10:10] part of the Book of Revelations now to
[10:13] be able to understand and see our time
[10:17] where we are right
[10:19] now that's what I'm trying to get us to
[10:21] see but then where we're going and what
[10:24] will be in the future right all right
[10:28] see we we know that the bride goes up in
[10:30] Revelations
[10:31] 4:1 and she's not seen again in in there
[10:35] on
[10:37] Earth until you come back into
[10:39] Revelations 19 when you're riding back
[10:41] into the millennial Reign all right now
[10:44] I didn't say it wasn't seen in heaven
[10:46] cuz that's Revelations 5 the prophet
[10:47] said she's not seen on Earth through
[10:50] there see and that's that's correct
[10:52] because it'll it'll tie together but we
[10:55] were trying to cover our
[10:57] Sunday and I want to make sure sure that
[10:59] you you follow me you know in the first
[11:04] part of the 19th Chapter there but but
[11:07] verse 7 and it says for the marriage of
[11:10] the Lamb is
[11:12] come all
[11:14] right and his bride
[11:17] ha made herself ready now I hope you
[11:19] followed what I was trying to bring out
[11:21] Sunday about that because we're not
[11:24] going over there to get ready right the
[11:27] getting ready has got to be here right
[11:30] this is the place where they're getting
[11:32] ready there won't be no extra uh place
[11:35] there that we can earn things out or do
[11:38] whatever you want to call it that's
[11:39] right we're we're uh we got to get it
[11:41] right here amen because when you come to
[11:44] this scripture see it doesn't say the
[11:46] bride will make herself ready or the
[11:49] wife it says the wife ha right all right
[11:53] and then it says also that the marriage
[11:55] of the
[11:56] Lamb is come
[12:00] all right well see then we know that
[12:02] we're not at this position yet right all
[12:05] right right but then we were covering
[12:07] that the prophet said in chapter 18
[12:09] where it says come out of her my people
[12:12] that then when you get over to chapter
[12:14] 19 it says after these
[12:17] things all right after what after the
[12:21] coming out amen the coming out is the
[12:24] getting ready that was the main thing I
[12:26] wanted you to see Sunday the coming out
[12:29] of the systems of getting away from
[12:32] organized religion and our thoughts and
[12:34] ideas and and all like that and anything
[12:37] contrary to the word is the main thing
[12:39] that we want to see because that's
[12:41] taking place now right it won't be that
[12:44] when we get up there right because
[12:47] that's what people thinks see we've
[12:49] always you know if you're there in
[12:52] organized religion very much you'd hear
[12:53] them say you know I'm not doing too good
[12:55] now but but when I get there when I get
[12:59] there Glory well that's good that's
[13:02] wonderful but I thought that the way the
[13:07] tree leans is the way it's going to fall
[13:09] right I thought whatever we are
[13:13] here that we will be that gu I didn't
[13:17] know this was going to be a a situation
[13:20] that we can have a court of appeal you
[13:23] know that when this is over with we can
[13:25] WIP out some of the things and problems
[13:28] I thought my understanding was that the
[13:32] bride doesn't go to the white Throne
[13:33] judgment we'll get to but there is a
[13:35] judgment of the Deeds Done in the body
[13:38] whether good or bad that the bride will
[13:40] have to face all right and see then that
[13:43] way we're going to have to face each
[13:45] other with it right that'll be the main
[13:47] thing it you know is we'll be judging
[13:49] each other right and that won't be a
[13:51] judgment of a decision of eternal life
[13:54] no because you already have it when you
[13:56] get to that place but it'll be be
[13:59] Judgment of the Deeds Done in the body
[14:01] whether good or
[14:02] bad now that was see I like to keep
[14:06] things in an
[14:07] order and that way I can use
[14:10] scriptures to to tie it together and and
[14:14] then I if I cross my scriptures up as I
[14:18] was saying about the coming of the Lord
[14:19] our Sunday see the coming of the Lord is
[14:22] many things in the scripture right and
[14:25] and you take a scripture that applies to
[14:26] the bride and put it to Israel look
[14:29] where you messed up you take one to
[14:30] Israel put it to the bride look where
[14:32] you messed up amen that's right cuz you
[14:33] see all of that is his coming all right
[14:37] and see then that way you can keep it
[14:39] together and certain scriptures apply to
[14:42] certain things then it can have compound
[14:46] meanings to word that it can apply to
[14:50] bride and you
[14:52] know Israel right but there's got to be
[14:55] a
[14:56] separation because once you bring the
[14:58] scripture together and you can see the
[15:01] bride of
[15:03] Christ she's his wife y right but Israel
[15:07] will never be his wife right she
[15:10] rejected that right right you know CU
[15:13] that won't that won't be connected but I
[15:16] I tried to say something Sunday and and
[15:19] you know maybe one of these days I'll
[15:21] get enough understanding myself to be
[15:22] able to preach on it but you know I've
[15:25] always thought about
[15:26] it as I say in Sunday there afternoon
[15:30] see we say that the Old Testament was
[15:31] Jehovah's bride the New Testament is
[15:34] Jesus's
[15:36] bride see if you ain't careful you got
[15:39] two two things right right right that
[15:42] are taking place Y and see then you can
[15:46] see how that the Jehovah the old is the
[15:49] Jesus of the new right right well you
[15:52] can see how those Old Testament Saints
[15:54] some of them came into the New Testament
[15:58] right
[15:59] right dispensation by the new
[16:02] birth but those that didn't some of
[16:05] those that will be chosen will actually
[16:07] be in the Millennium and things like
[16:09] that but they'll never
[16:11] be brought back as a form of a wife
[16:15] right right amen there will be servants
[16:18] and you know the 144,000 and they'll
[16:21] be you know breing and things we can
[16:24] call them all those things and we won't
[16:25] look down on them right amen it's like a
[16:28] said about the servants it's not the
[16:30] servants that they're going to be yes my
[16:33] Lord yes my Lord
[16:34] no see you're getting too much in your
[16:37] mind of thinking about one of these days
[16:39] is going to be something no they'll
[16:41] they'll be there and they'll have their
[16:43] job right they'll be servants for the
[16:46] bride but not running around doing your
[16:49] work for you right you know and you
[16:51] sitting back somewhere sipping on a Coke
[16:53] you know cuz I don't think none of
[16:55] that's going to be there right all right
[16:56] but I'm just you know just trying to get
[16:58] a point for us to see something that see
[17:02] that way then you can take those some of
[17:04] those Old Testament Saints bring them
[17:05] right into the New
[17:07] Testament and there's only then one
[17:09] bride right that's
[17:12] righten right yep now whether you like
[17:15] it or what you lump it that's right only
[17:18] those that were the chosen of
[17:22] Israel right was able to come into the
[17:25] New Testament dispensation right and
[17:28] that would have been Jehovah's bride yep
[17:32] had there not been a new
[17:34] testament y That's right right
[17:37] absolutely I tried to say that Sunday I
[17:39] know that if you get that tangled up
[17:41] just call me I'll try to express it to
[17:43] you maybe I can explain it to myself
[17:45] some of these days but see I just don't
[17:47] see all of this that ties up you got too
[17:49] many wives running around you got too
[17:51] many thoughts too many
[17:53] problems that's right see if they had
[17:55] not been a new testament group of people
[17:57] to come in then that would have been all
[18:00] Israel wouldn't have been the Bride of
[18:02] Jehovah
[18:04] right come on right he wasn't married to
[18:08] all of that junk it's like he's not
[18:10] married to all the Gentiles right right
[18:14] right yep it's the chosen amen see then
[18:18] that way I've got one wife to worry
[18:20] about you know that I can see how they
[18:24] come right on over into where we are and
[18:25] we go over here and then we all go up
[18:27] together one of these days right we
[18:28] don't have to worry about it then we go
[18:30] to the Millennium and they'll be
[18:32] there but they rejected the right
[18:36] of sunship some of them did right and
[18:40] they'll get to come up but some of them
[18:42] come over into our dispensation yep
[18:45] Peter Paul right James
[18:50] John amen the day of Pentecost was was
[18:54] Jewish sure as a matter of fact the
[18:56] prophet I think I put it almost to work
[18:58] that even the first church age was
[19:00] basically Jewish we said well maybe just
[19:03] a few Gentiles brought
[19:04] in but then when they come into the New
[19:06] Testament dispensation they were
[19:08] Gentiles right cuz that's what he come
[19:10] to get was a gentile bride all right now
[19:13] but see she's made herself ready we've
[19:15] got to get ready here right or there
[19:17] won't be anything there to be able to
[19:20] worry about so we brought it out like
[19:23] the prophet was covering off of of the
[19:25] message God's keeps his word in he says
[19:29] the garments are paid for they're ready
[19:32] but but you must be ready to wear those
[19:37] garments see I know it's hard for people
[19:39] to to realize and follow it to the
[19:41] correct way I know what the scripture
[19:44] says that salvations of the Lord that's
[19:46] Jonah 2:9 I'm pretty
[19:48] sure and we didn't do anything to get
[19:51] saved we just accepted Jesus Christ as
[19:53] our
[19:56] savior now he knew we would accept that
[19:59] so he knew what all of the rest would be
[20:02] but now after you're born
[20:05] again you know after you're born again
[20:09] you do have something to do with your
[20:11] salvation yes sir all right that's what
[20:13] I'm talking about the Deeds Done in the
[20:15] body we'll get back to that when we get
[20:16] to Revelation you know the the the white
[20:19] Throne judgment and then the Judgment of
[20:21] the Deeds we'll cover a lot of that and
[20:23] use what the prophet is saying but you
[20:26] see church then we must put on the
[20:28] garment they're provided right but we
[20:31] must put on the Garment you remember the
[20:33] prophet even in God's provided way was
[20:35] talking about the little girl that you
[20:39] remember the armor meat packing man come
[20:41] out looking for a wife and the things
[20:43] and the little girl saved all of her
[20:46] money yep she had a lot to do with it
[20:49] yep amen you remember
[20:51] Ruth she had a time that she was
[20:54] laboring yep but when she was sent home
[20:57] with those six measures of
[21:00] barley the seals and the things in other
[21:03] words that's right when she was sent
[21:05] home with that she was resting all right
[21:08] so that's what's happened in our day
[21:10] we've had the seals delivered unto us
[21:12] amen we're coming into a rest yes that's
[21:15] that's the rest day will be the
[21:16] Millennium
[21:18] amen all right that will be the rest day
[21:22] that will be the the real Sabbath right
[21:25] amen I've got it in here somewhere that
[21:28] be the real one but are we ready to put
[21:31] the garments
[21:32] on right well you you sound like you're
[21:35] making salvation some kind of
[21:38] works I thought Works was supposed to be
[21:41] our faith expressed right amen that was
[21:45] what I thought it was to me amen all
[21:47] right see then in doing
[21:48] that brother random talks about that
[21:51] little girl saving all of her
[21:55] money but we fail to look where he says
[21:58] and the
[21:59] money that he sent her right
[22:02] amen see he sends us gifts amen he sends
[22:06] us Ministries he sends us people to help
[22:08] us amen right all right he sends those
[22:12] to them that's what he says there in the
[22:13] scriptures they he gave some Apostles
[22:16] some prophets some evangels some pastors
[22:18] some teachers for the perfecting the
[22:20] bringing of the Bride into
[22:22] completion all right see we're not in
[22:25] the days of just being good and going to
[22:27] church come on right we're in the days
[22:30] that these bodies are going to have to
[22:32] be changed amen amen all right the
[22:35] prophet I gave it to you on the marriage
[22:37] of the Lamb where he said 1962 where he
[22:40] said if God put you in a pipe and pushed
[22:43] you through the other side there would
[22:45] be no overcoming for you that's right
[22:47] and you go check every Church age it
[22:49] says to the
[22:51] Overcomer right all right now he gives
[22:55] us the ability to overcome yes amen does
[22:58] that he does those things giving us that
[23:03] ability but the prophet said on on the
[23:05] marriage of the Lamb he said that she
[23:07] had to lay aside all of these
[23:12] things you know you remember he was
[23:14] referring to Esther right why was Esther
[23:19] chosen
[23:22] yep you remember who was it Mor that his
[23:25] name right you remember he kind of knew
[23:27] a little secret sure did he couldn't
[23:29] knew what the king liked that's it you
[23:32] know it amen so he dressed her according
[23:34] to what the king liked amen the rest of
[23:37] them pued theirselves up real flusty
[23:39] Dusty you know or whatever you call it
[23:41] flusty dsy and got all pred up but y he
[23:46] put Esther the way she was supposed to
[23:48] be right amen and when that King looked
[23:50] out there amen he saw her dress the way
[23:53] he wanted her he saw her living the way
[23:55] he wanted her and that's what the bride
[23:57] of Christ
[23:59] all right trying to review just to H now
[24:01] to get us to
[24:02] going brother said on the message PR uh
[24:07] pardon preaching 63 he said Jesus is
[24:10] waiting on his church to get ready the
[24:14] his bride has made herself ready we got
[24:18] the potentials the holy spirit is
[24:21] here see to get ready we got everything
[24:24] we need we got the message of the hour
[24:27] all right didn't we going on over to
[24:29] where we were in birth pain we brother
[24:30] around and said what kind of a garment
[24:32] did she have on to make herself
[24:35] ready his own word word now he's given
[24:39] us the word in the in timey to be able
[24:41] to come to that place right that we
[24:44] can be
[24:48] ready a baby is born to
[24:54] baby now trying to illustrate salvation
[24:57] but you know if that b don't eat right
[25:01] it's not going to live right amen all
[25:04] right see then we do have something to
[25:06] do with our Salvation after we're born
[25:08] again
[25:10] right because we can choose to go up the
[25:12] statue of a perfect man or choose to be
[25:15] blly just hoop BL and forget it
[25:19] Y and that's what I see a lot of the
[25:21] people of the message doing now that
[25:23] years ago they used to be so on fire
[25:26] right so built up and so gear it up but
[25:29] now it's just y well I'll go to church
[25:32] when I want to yeah I got the tapes I
[25:35] can watch it on the internet I can do
[25:38] what I want to Y but do
[25:43] you right do you come
[25:47] on very easy to snooze in the lounge
[25:50] chair home man at least here you got
[25:54] somebody around you might holler wake
[25:56] you
[25:57] up but now
[26:01] remember see she's got to put on that
[26:04] garment yep which is the revealed word
[26:08] amen and I was trying to illustrate it
[26:11] on the form of getting ready for this
[26:14] message tonight
[26:17] that see we talk about that when we're
[26:20] already married to
[26:23] Christ that's
[26:25] true I hope you listen to Sunday
[26:27] afternoon message y wouldn't
[26:33] hear do you say well but brother Dale we
[26:35] got the quotes we're already married
[26:39] amen but what about where we're going to
[26:41] the wedding Amen in the
[26:43] sky how about in the same message of
[26:46] invisible Union where brother R is
[26:48] talking about looking like that we're
[26:51] already in sin we're already
[26:53] married and then in a minute he says
[26:55] we're going to the wedding in the sky y
[27:00] but see there's not but one wedding
[27:02] right right amen all right right but
[27:04] it's in stages right amen it's just what
[27:07] it's developing and that what I was
[27:09] trying to get to point across on this
[27:11] our Sunday to to be able to get to the
[27:13] place cuz brother brandom covers
[27:16] it and he says on the second coming of
[27:18] the
[27:19] Lord said we're not only engaged but
[27:23] we're married right amen the church is
[27:26] married to Christ we are the wife of
[27:29] Christ bringing forth children right
[27:32] well
[27:34] amen that's true
[27:36] right cuz once you receive the new birth
[27:38] you're married to Christ amen by the new
[27:41] birth that's but there's a lot more of
[27:43] this part out here that's involved
[27:45] that's right all right this what I was
[27:47] trying to get across Sunday afternoon CU
[27:49] brother around and said why we're
[27:50] against or why I'm against organized
[27:52] religion says after these things after
[27:55] these things after this right come out
[27:57] of hurt after after these things is the
[27:59] shout of the bride with the bridegroom
[28:02] going listen to The Marriage of the
[28:11] Lamb going to the marriage of the
[28:18] Lamb see we're going to get married one
[28:20] day but we're already married
[28:28] when you're engaged you're married right
[28:30] right Y is that the way it starts we get
[28:34] on a marriage and divorce we finish up
[28:37] this when you ask a girl to marriage you
[28:39] and she accepts you're married right
[28:41] right amen but you're not married
[28:44] because that don't give you a right to
[28:45] go live together y that don't make that
[28:49] the legal legal part of it
[28:53] right all right so there's a lot going
[28:56] to a wed so the prophet can say we're
[28:59] already married and we are by the new
[29:03] birth but that's only in your soul
[29:05] that's your father strong strong right
[29:07] amen
[29:10] right see we're going to the marriage of
[29:13] the Lamb it doesn't say going to the
[29:15] marriage of the father
[29:18] right that's what we're that's what's
[29:20] going on now right
[29:24] amen and see then that word that we're
[29:27] received
[29:28] in I gave you the quotes our Sunday that
[29:31] we're uniting with him the word while
[29:34] we're here that's a
[29:37] wedding that's a part of a wedding is
[29:40] uniting with
[29:42] him right I thought we believed at least
[29:45] here in Lula to to say it that that we
[29:48] believe that the bride is going to be
[29:50] the son of man according to the way the
[29:52] prophet said right right
[29:54] correct now brother d That's only
[29:56] brother random w s all right you you
[29:59] just ain't read enough right amen the
[30:01] bride is going to be the fullness of the
[30:03] godhead bleen that's that's
[30:07] right like we were talking yesterday
[30:11] brother Mark brother Donnie and brother
[30:13] Chris
[30:15] and we sitting there talking I told him
[30:17] I said there's a whole lot goes with
[30:20] what we're doing right am am a lot of
[30:23] things go with it you know you say well
[30:27] I I brother I've got the quote right
[30:29] here that we're married to Christ what
[30:31] are you trying to say that I'm going to
[30:34] a marriage in the sky no I'm trying to
[30:35] tell you the prophet says we are
[30:38] right okay yeah right the same one you
[30:42] want to
[30:44] quote he says we're going to a wedding
[30:47] in the sky he said we're going to the
[30:49] wedding of the
[30:56] Lamb he says on the book paragraph 5 359
[31:01] of The Sixth Seal talking about on The
[31:03] Sixth Seal and he says the bride is done
[31:06] gone forth the Queen's done went to take
[31:09] her place she's being married now to the
[31:12] king while this was going
[31:18] on see that's what I'm saying the people
[31:21] want some onesided idea or a thought now
[31:25] I'm sorry I'm just say what I believe
[31:27] and leave it alone that's as
[31:29] organizational as anything else is
[31:32] amen and for me to take a one-sided View
[31:35] and won't receive the other
[31:37] right if the people would take it that
[31:39] way it would correct a lot of things
[31:42] right see brother rown says while that
[31:45] the Ser listen this is questions and
[31:47] ansers back in
[31:50] 57 and while the ceremony is going on in
[31:53] heaven of the Bride the Gentile bride
[31:56] being married to the prince
[31:59] while they're being married there's
[32:00] three and 1/2 years taking place on
[32:02] Earth with Moses and Elijah
[32:06] right see years ago this came up and I
[32:09] just kind of bypassed it and let it go
[32:11] but I knew I'd come back to it
[32:14] eventually because I believe I believe
[32:17] by the new
[32:18] birth that we
[32:20] are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[32:23] that's
[32:25] right but it says our Revelation is why
[32:28] has made her sever day right so there's
[32:30] a lot of difference between to say a
[32:32] bride and a wife
[32:34] y because it signifies a wife as
[32:37] maturity
[32:39] right when me and Peggy first got
[32:42] married you know everything was yours
[32:44] yours yours I don't have anything yours
[32:48] that's
[32:52] yours I thought and understood that
[32:54] everything I had was yours and
[32:55] everything you had was mine right you
[32:58] know I don't like what the fell said one
[33:01] time he
[33:02] said everything I have is mine and
[33:04] everything my wife has is mine now that
[33:07] gets over kind of a little on the yeah
[33:09] wrong side but see since she
[33:14] finally got out of that now she says
[33:18] mine why because she's grown
[33:21] up you know she's become a wife she
[33:24] realizes that hey no matter what she's a
[33:28] part of me amen and she owns just as
[33:31] much as I
[33:33] do and that way see then you can get it
[33:35] all together and like I was you know
[33:38] I've tried to bring it out Sunday then
[33:40] what are we
[33:42] doing we're married to Christ the word
[33:45] right here we have a new birth
[33:48] amen and this bride in the end time is
[33:51] coming to a place that no bride down
[33:54] Through the Ages has had to come you
[33:56] remember there's a bride in each age
[33:59] now it's all one bride right come on it
[34:01] ain't brides and brides and brides and
[34:02] brides and Brides you know it's one
[34:05] bride right in each age made manifest
[34:09] right all right now in this age we are
[34:13] responsible for bringing them out of the
[34:15] ground that's went on ahead of us amen
[34:18] right all right and to do that we must
[34:21] become the word amen amen his wife has
[34:25] made herself ready right that's got to
[34:27] be right here right I believe that or we
[34:30] don't go there that's right that's right
[34:32] when we go there and 19 says that verse
[34:36] 7 says his wife has made herself ready
[34:38] the marriage of the Lamb has come y
[34:42] right see doesn't as I said I kept
[34:44] saying it Sunday it doesn't say the
[34:46] marriage of the father
[34:49] right that's what people can't
[34:51] understand they can't take the things
[34:53] brother R will be dealing with us
[34:54] talking with them yesterday about we are
[34:56] his
[34:58] Offspring right is that scripture right
[35:01] y we are his wife is that scripture
[35:05] right we are his bride is that scripture
[35:07] we're his children is that
[35:11] scripture come on is that right right
[35:13] are we all of them
[35:15] things but you know one thing that we
[35:17] are that we got to know in this
[35:19] day we are him made manifest right there
[35:25] amen not just a why
[35:28] right see there's where you putting the
[35:30] wife she's over here husband's over here
[35:33] right children's over here fathers over
[35:37] here see you're making two different
[35:39] things out of it you can't come out to
[35:42] the fullness of the godhead B being in
[35:44] the bride by making him one person and
[35:47] you another one that's
[35:51] right we are him made manifest amen
[35:54] right 1969 in Athens Georg of the first
[35:58] sermon I preached that the Bride of
[36:00] Jesus Christ was the son of
[36:03] man that's what she had to be in this
[36:05] end time right amen don't you think I
[36:08] feel wonderful about it that that has
[36:10] never been taken away but it keeps
[36:11] adding too
[36:16] amen the Bride of Jesus Christ has got
[36:19] to be him right right we become so much
[36:22] as
[36:24] one until he doesn't divide between us
[36:28] right now you notice where I said that
[36:31] he don't divide amen right he don't look
[36:35] over you another person yeah he said but
[36:39] that's getting too
[36:41] close I wish we could get it closer
[36:44] right right like I told the brother
[36:46] about it you know the Catholic believe
[36:48] the pope is God sure they just don't
[36:50] believe they that's it right there
[36:53] that's the
[36:54] problem it's like I told that man I
[36:56] talking to up Je Ville Indiana that
[37:00] day and he was a deity person believe
[37:03] brother Rand was
[37:05] God I said I believe in deity brother
[37:09] right I said take away all R R's gifts
[37:12] and the signs cuz that's that's not to
[37:14] dealing with right but as a human
[37:16] being I'll go along with you that that
[37:19] was deity standing there if you'll
[37:21] accept this brother standing here that
[37:22] has the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[37:24] deity right he says oh no oh M well see
[37:30] I don't need talking to him anymore no
[37:32] cuz he's done settled see he's got his
[37:34] idea the Pope says he's
[37:37] God see he just don't have any
[37:40] children
[37:43] right
[37:45] right the pope ain't supposed to have
[37:47] any that's right it might have been a
[37:49] lot of them that did but they're not
[37:51] supposed to have that's according to
[37:53] their
[37:56] book but see God's Not only got
[37:59] children brother R said God would become
[38:02] visible among us but he says he doesn't
[38:06] come your Corporal no that's right we
[38:08] meet him in the iron but said he become
[38:10] visable Among Us raise the dead and we
[38:12] go into Rapture he well how much more
[38:16] visible can it be if the bride will ever
[38:18] get down to the basis of saying I'm him
[38:21] made manifest amen that's right that's
[38:25] just too much brother D no no no
[38:29] that's the truth of the word right I
[38:31] believe
[38:33] that but we don't want to believe it
[38:34] that way no we want to leave it as some
[38:38] kind of a he's over there we're over
[38:40] here that's right yeah
[38:42] right you say well well brother D will
[38:45] that make us the god of
[38:50] Heaven that'll make us to God that he
[38:52] wanted us to be
[38:54] right wouldn't it that when Paul got up
[38:57] on Mark
[38:59] Hill and they just had all these little
[39:01] places you know and they had all these
[39:02] Gods then they had one little place left
[39:05] and they just made a little cubicle
[39:06] something and they said to the unknown
[39:08] God right just in case they forgot one
[39:10] of them right we know what Paul said he
[39:14] said that's the one I want to talk to
[39:15] you that's right
[39:18] amen he said and now even your poets say
[39:22] man y we are his offspring Y come on
[39:27] but do we believe it Church come on do
[39:29] we believe that we are the children of
[39:31] God right amen well that's hard to be is
[39:34] it it's hard to be the children of God
[39:36] and the wife of God at the same time but
[39:39] that's what he says
[39:44] right my wife calls me Daddy not because
[39:48] I'm her
[39:50] father the kids call me poppy most of
[39:52] you around here call me poppy not
[39:54] because I'm your physical right
[39:58] you
[39:59] know Daddy or
[40:03] whatever see it's in the gospel right
[40:06] that's
[40:08] right see now she's not only my
[40:12] wife mother she's a part of me right
[40:18] yeah yep but see we we don't want to do
[40:20] it that way but we'd rather lean over to
[40:23] the other side and say well well I just
[40:27] make be in a way now in a way that might
[40:30] be right brother said there's no such
[40:32] thing as in a way you either one or the
[40:35] other right we are either Jesus Christ
[40:37] made manifest or we are the Antichrist
[40:40] made manifest one or the other I believe
[40:42] that amen that's
[40:45] right did you see
[40:49] church we are going to the wedding in
[40:52] the sky right we all talk about that yep
[40:56] right but you see then everybody wants
[40:58] to try to prove some kind of a point
[41:00] they say well over in Israel they have
[41:02] the the marriage supper before the
[41:05] wedding you know but what does that make
[41:08] right what does that
[41:12] change your Prophet was speaking in
[41:15] English terminologies human
[41:16] terminologies of our day and he'd say
[41:19] we're going to the wedding in the sky
[41:22] amen even said one time he said if I
[41:24] don't see you anymore I'll see at the
[41:25] marriage of the land
[41:28] I'll see at the wedding supper
[41:31] yeah but see the marriage of the Lamb is
[41:34] when that son of
[41:37] man we've got to be married to him
[41:40] because we're going to have faries like
[41:41] his right amen but you know what he is
[41:45] the father right
[41:48] Amen brother Brandon was chapter 5 of
[41:51] revelation will have him sitting on the
[41:53] throne and while you have him over here
[41:55] getting up walking around coming over
[41:57] here taking the book getting up on the
[41:59] throne and sitting down y that's right
[42:02] it's just simple acts of a play right
[42:04] right amen it's just simple ways of what
[42:06] he's doing he come to pay the price for
[42:09] our Salvation Amen to release his life
[42:12] to make us his children and to make us
[42:15] joint
[42:16] erors right is that scripture now that's
[42:19] right Revelations 8 I mean Romans 8
[42:23] right that were joint a right ARS of
[42:29] God and join ours with Jesus Christ amen
[42:32] amen is that scripture
[42:35] right but you see church what do we are
[42:37] what do we
[42:39] do what are
[42:43] we see where his wife amen where his
[42:47] children where his
[42:49] offspring where his
[42:52] bride right we're his beloved amen
[42:55] there's many many terms of it yep it's
[42:58] only one church church that's right but
[43:02] see this end time people has to come to
[43:04] a place to realize that now that doesn't
[43:08] mean that them down through there in the
[43:11] ages gone by are not the bride of Christ
[43:16] right they're the they're the bride
[43:18] there is Offspring there is
[43:21] wife y but they would come to maturity
[43:23] to be fully called a wife right amen
[43:26] this is end time to do
[43:29] that we were talking and our son was
[43:31] asking Sunday about it said when we get
[43:33] there will they be lower than us I said
[43:36] no Luther and them will be just the same
[43:38] as we are when we get there but they're
[43:40] going to realize how come they got there
[43:44] right they're going to want to talk to
[43:46] you about it
[43:49] y because now if Luther if brother's
[43:52] right whatever we are here we are over
[43:54] here then Luther right was a trinit
[43:57] while he was here yep that's just the
[44:00] outside man but that Inside Man of that
[44:03] new birth was never a
[44:06] trinity come on I want to see that
[44:09] somewhere right y if you can show me in
[44:11] the prophet's message that wasn't a
[44:12] trinity no that new birth inside of him
[44:15] was a new birth just like everybody's
[44:16] new birth that's right amen making him
[44:19] an offspring just like it makes you an
[44:21] offspring so I'm not teaching an end
[44:23] time as to coming out to be a super
[44:25] duper special wife

[44:43] we have the wedding
[44:45] supper we're going to be married to

[44:58] right there's going to be a wedding in
[45:01] the sky
[45:03] amen for the Bride of Jesus Christ but
[45:07] you see like I said while ago you take
[45:08] the second coming of Christ and you try
[45:10] to apply it wrong with his coming and
[45:13] you got the Jews and you got the bride
[45:14] you got this and see here you take the
[45:17] prophet's message of this about we're
[45:20] already married one group will go this
[45:22] way y the other group says we're going
[45:24] to get married y well I to be both of
[45:28] them the day you get the new birth you
[45:31] got married that day that's right that's
[45:33] right when we go to heaven in glory
[45:36] whatever you want to call
[45:39] that there's going to be a wedding in
[45:42] the
[45:45] sky remember we only deal with three and
[45:48] A2 Years A lot of times
[45:51] but we know for a certainty before we
[45:54] come back in the Millennium that that's
[45:56] right there got to be a 7-year period
[45:58] yep that's right we know that from
[46:00] Daniel 70 weeks amen that's where people
[46:02] don't want to listen to that part of it
[46:04] that's right that's what a man asked me
[46:07] and said where are we going after we get
[46:09] there I
[46:11] said I didn't answer
[46:14] him I went home I sat down I said the
[46:17] man asked a serious question Lord right
[46:19] what are we going to do he said just
[46:20] check out the
[46:22] prophet run a few things in brother said
[46:26] we're going to the father's house he
[46:29] said just like
[46:32] when Isaac and Rebecca got
[46:35] married they went straight to the
[46:37] father's
[46:40] house see we're going to have a
[46:43] beautiful time amen what kind of wedding
[46:47] is that going to
[46:48] be I ain't worried about
[46:53] it I'm not concerned about it that's
[46:59] right but I am concerned with one thing
[47:02] getting
[47:03] ready that's
[47:05] right and then everything else will take
[47:07] care of
[47:08] it all right now when we get to heaven
[47:13] let's jump over into going now a
[47:19] little we're going to the wedding the
[47:22] prophet said in the sky paragraph 277
[47:24] invisible Union pull that up brother Joe
[47:27] in the SE Brother
[47:29] Anderson I just want you to read it but
[47:31] I want you to realize in the same
[47:33] message I'll be glad to show it to you
[47:35] he look like he's talking and he is
[47:36] we're already married y but look what he
[47:39] said here hallelujah now notice you're
[47:42] not only that but you're going to the
[47:44] wedding in the sky and you're weing the
[47:46] wedding band of predestinated unmar
[47:48] Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited
[47:51] of your own what to a wedding in the sky
[47:57] and then there'll be a great marriage
[47:58] supper I gave you a quote our Sunday We
[48:01] R around and said they ask him was was
[48:03] the uh marriage supper where was it that
[48:06] he said the marriage supper comes before
[48:08] the Millennium
[48:11] right yes abs and see that's where it
[48:14] has to fit in you put everything in
[48:16] order and you don't have to back off of
[48:18] nothing amen see you don't have to
[48:20] change nothing in the Book of
[48:22] Revelation you got 19 and that's riding
[48:24] back into the Millennium and then you
[48:26] got like 20 covers the white Throne cuz
[48:30] see that's after the
[48:34] Millennium there's nothing out of order
[48:36] in the Book of Revelation all perfect
[48:39] right everything got to be put in order
[48:42] but now watch where are we going then
[48:45] and I want to leave some of this about
[48:47] the Millennium to be able just to take
[48:49] one thought with the Millennium point
[48:51] but I want your thoughts to be on this
[48:53] look what number two it says where are
[48:55] we going now we're going to the wedding
[49:00] supper and look at the message that's
[49:04] in
[49:05] yep it's in the future home
[49:08] right and look what he
[49:11] says help us Lord if there is one here
[49:14] that's called to the wedding supper of
[49:16] the
[49:17] Lamb this thousand years of Millennium
[49:21] rain and then and to then enter into the
[49:25] city after the honeymoon is over yep the
[49:28] Millennium is merely the honeymoon then
[49:31] she the bride takes his bridegroom takes
[49:33] his bride yep
[49:35] home see there's more after we get to
[49:37] with the Millennium
[49:39] amen it's hers her bridegroom his bride
[49:43] oh he's going to prepare a
[49:45] house since he's become
[49:48] engaged amen
[49:51] now if brother R I'm just honest now
[49:54] watch I know that don't mean a thing to
[49:56] you but if he hadn't said that like
[50:00] that look where you'd be
[50:04] y if he said we were already married
[50:08] just a BL but he didn't choose that he
[50:10] say
[50:13] engaged cuz see the Bride of Jesus
[50:16] Christ will be there
[50:19] amen those that was in each one of those
[50:23] ages coming
[50:25] down yep if you're engaged you're
[50:27] married
[50:28] [Music]
[50:30] right right all right so then look why
[50:33] he would choose I mean sometime I sat
[50:36] down and I weeped of the
[50:38] terminologies this man could
[50:42] use because if he said it this way look
[50:44] where it would be he said it this way
[50:46] look where it would
[50:48] be and he says it just perfectly we get
[50:51] all
[50:55] confused but just think about it see
[50:58] we're going to Millennium is going to be
[51:00] the
[51:03] honeymoon the
[51:05] honeymoon is going to be the Millennium
[51:08] a thousand
[51:10] years I read you one the minute where he
[51:12] said we'll be there building houses and
[51:17] things I ain't worried about
[51:20] working I enjoy
[51:23] it most people are lazy and don't want
[51:25] to work you know that four-letter word
[51:27] is dirty W RK you know but I've always
[51:31] just worked on my life and it wouldn't
[51:33] bother me to get there and just just
[51:34] build houses cuz it's not going to be
[51:36] like it is now right I mean I don't
[51:39] think you're going to have to worry
[51:40] about hitting your finger with a
[51:42] hammer how that would be I don't know
[51:44] but I ain't worried about it if you did
[51:47] it ain't going to hurt you cuz you're
[51:48] going to be in a glorified body cuz
[51:50] we're going to read that the
[51:52] second but you see it's just things you
[51:54] don't understand the brother R says it
[51:56] way in the future home he said there
[51:58] will be things in the Millennium that
[51:59] will not be in the future home that's
[52:02] correct
[52:05] absolutely that's his word right but
[52:07] just think about it that's what hit me
[52:09] we're going to the wedding supper of the
[52:19] Lamb you know no matter what you think
[52:21] about
[52:24] god let's see if I can get the r
[52:27] ter you know there's never a time that
[52:30] the lamb won't be present right
[52:34] right that's right when we leave out of
[52:37] here and we go to
[52:40] heaven the lamb will be there
[52:43] yeah but the father will be
[52:47] there but it won't be a pillar of fire
[52:49] over here and a halo over here and a
[52:50] little bird flooding around
[52:53] here we're just going to see him and
[52:55] know who he is
[52:58] if we could just if you could take what
[53:00] you have right now and be able keep what
[53:02] you have right now the words you have
[53:05] and back up and stand there and look at
[53:07] him as he was standing there and when he
[53:09] said unless you believe that I am he
[53:11] you'll die in your sins you you scream
[53:14] heyen I see
[53:16] it but you see it had to come the other
[53:19] way we didn't have it back there so we
[53:20] wouldn't there all right but listen
[53:24] going to a honeymoon
[53:28] going to a honeymoon
[53:30] y of the Bride of Jesus Christ in our
[53:33] groom go ahead to the next
[53:34] one 64 823 questions and answer number
[53:41] two will there be people on Earth in
[53:44] Corporal bodies during that time yes
[53:47] sir we will have our glorified body
[53:50] right here on Earth eating drinking
[53:52] building houses and then living just
[53:54] like we do now for a, years and it's the
[53:58] honeymoon of the bride and the groom
[54:00] right
[54:02] now I know that I shouldn't
[54:07] be I try to keep people from running off
[54:10] on the deep
[54:13] end now to a lot of people when you talk
[54:16] about a
[54:18] honeymoon it means husband and
[54:22] wife you understand
[54:27] what happens on
[54:29] honeymoon but see we ought to clean that
[54:32] out of our
[54:35] minds that's the point of what I
[54:37] thinking going to
[54:39] go see if we're married to him doesn't
[54:41] mean that we are having
[54:44] intercourse the Holy Spirit never had
[54:46] intercourse with Mary to bring forth
[54:48] Jesus
[54:50] Christ see let's get all of that washed
[54:52] out amen and see they come to brother
[54:55] brandom and they said brother brandham
[54:57] will it be children born in the
[54:59] Millennium he said I don't
[55:01] know he said sometimes it look like they
[55:04] will and sometimes it
[55:09] won't but just remember There Is A
[55:11] Healer to be draw up in the Millennium
[55:15] right that will be in corpal Corporal
[55:19] bodies
[55:21] absolutely right y a gospel to the
[55:24] Heathen that's what he told us
[55:27] so there'll be people there in Corporal
[55:28] bodies will he be having babies I don't
[55:30] know cuz they know my
[55:32] business but now us there in glorified
[55:36] bodies I don't think that there's going
[55:38] to be any babies
[55:40] more no they'd be glorified
[55:44] babies and it wouldn't be
[55:46] babies because it'd have to go up to be
[55:48] about 18 20 years old quick as it's
[55:50] birth that wouldn't work you say well
[55:52] you shouldn't no I shouldn't even have
[55:54] to explain that but there's a lot of
[55:55] people are so caral in their
[55:58] thinking until that's what they think
[56:01] about they think about all this other
[56:03] stuff instead of seeing what a beautiful
[56:05] wonderful thing is happening right now
[56:07] in The Bride of Jesus Christ that she's
[56:10] pregnated with the word to give four
[56:13] children unto
[56:19] God that's a spiritual condition
[56:21] wonderful
[56:22] position right look to the next one
[56:31] look what he's saying here in Revelation
[56:33] of Jesus Christ this is Page 41 church
[56:35] hbook then we see that when these light
[56:38] of Israel have been joined in love to
[56:42] the Lord that's in the tribulation
[56:44] period
[56:46] right and the enemy has been destroyed
[56:49] that's armag Edon God will prepare His
[56:52] Holy Mountain his new Garden of Eden for
[56:55] the bride and his and her attendance for
[56:58] the Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the
[57:00] earth now watching as Adam and Eve were
[57:03] in the garden and did not finish out the
[57:05] Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam
[57:08] and his Eve the true church WIll F
[57:11] fulfill all the plan of
[57:14] God see somebody's going to live a th
[57:17] years to prove the sin curses go but
[57:19] it's not being you why because we're
[57:22] Eternal right you ain't going to be
[57:23] worried about it right
[57:26] just think about it all I want to get is
[57:28] a point acrop we look one
[57:32] more paragraph
[57:35] 149 of questions and answers real three
[57:37] which is
[57:39] 64830 does the Millennium have to do
[57:41] with 1,000 years could it be a
[57:45] generation no a generation is wred in
[57:48] the Bible there 40 generation a lotted
[57:50] in the Bible is 40 years but the Bible
[57:53] said and they lived and reigned with
[57:55] Christ 1,000
[57:58] years it will be 1,000 years upon the
[58:00] Earth cuz 1,000 years upon the Earth is
[58:02] only counted a time for Parable like to
[58:07] God as one day 1,000 years upon the
[58:10] Earth is only one day with the Lord
[58:12] that's what scripture says right as God
[58:14] cting time how many you understand that
[58:18] now so it's that Sabbath
[58:22] yep Sabbath day right Millennium yep
[58:26] when the church will no more labor
[58:28] against sin Y and Satan is Bound for a
[58:30] little season A Thousand Years cuz his
[58:34] subjects are all in hell now he subject
[58:37] and here's the church that's on the
[58:39] earth is redeemed and right in the
[58:41] presence of Christ so he has nothing he
[58:44] can work on so it's not a chain as I
[58:46] said a log chain it's a chain of
[58:49] circumstances he has nothing he can do
[58:52] he's helpless and hopeless just waiting
[58:55] for the resurrection ction of the
[58:57] subjects then they're separated as sheep
[58:59] from the
[59:00] goats Satan is bound A Thousand Years a
[59:03] millennial Reign we'll get back to a
[59:04] millennial point on that when we're
[59:07] we're trying to cover that in the next
[59:09] message or so but you see what I'm
[59:11] talking
[59:13] about the order of what's Happening we
[59:16] as the Bride of Jesus Christ will one
[59:18] day take a change of the
[59:20] body we meet our Lord in the air because
[59:23] he doesn't set foot on this Earth until
[59:25] the millennial rign in a Corporal
[59:26] physical body that's what your Prophet
[59:29] said but we meet him in the
[59:31] air and we go to a marriage of the
[59:38] lamb as we go to the marriage of the
[59:40] Lamb then after that marriage is
[59:42] finished there will be a marriage supper
[59:46] right wonderful
[59:50] time during that period of time that
[59:53] we're being married to him and the
[59:56] marriage supper brother brandham says he
[59:59] slips back down here to reveal himself
[1:00:03] to the
[1:00:05] 144,000 now I've got my own thoughts S I
[1:00:08] ain't got no quote from brother Brandon
[1:00:10] but I got a thought I don't know what
[1:00:13] yours
[1:00:14] is do you think that he's leaving us and
[1:00:16] he slips
[1:00:20] out what's the point
[1:00:24] right can be there with us and be down
[1:00:27] here y absolutely right right he can be
[1:00:30] revealing himself to the Jews and still
[1:00:32] be with us right right you say well I
[1:00:34] don't know where it's true or not well
[1:00:36] he's up there and he's down here now so
[1:00:40] I just turned it around on
[1:00:42] you if you can't see it one way you
[1:00:44] surely won't see it the other that's
[1:00:46] right but if one of them right the other
[1:00:47] is he's right here with us now that's
[1:00:49] right right brother R said and brother
[1:00:51] Mark was bringing out yesterday outside
[1:00:54] of the Corporal body
[1:00:56] he's here just as much as he was when he
[1:00:59] walked a
[1:01:02] short just not the Corporal body right
[1:01:06] right but see then he doesn't have to
[1:01:07] slip away that's terminology that's
[1:01:09] words right he doesn't have to leave
[1:01:13] us right he can just be right there with
[1:01:17] us Brother Gary and yet he
[1:01:21] can IM morphe
[1:01:24] himself right down here
[1:01:27] to those two witnesses cuz remember one
[1:01:32] thing I quoted it let's see if you
[1:01:34] remember it he doesn't set foot on the
[1:01:36] earth in a Corporal body until the
[1:01:38] Millennium so revealing himself to the
[1:01:40] Jews is not a Corporal body right right
[1:01:45] come on I lay them down to where it get
[1:01:47] you get thinking then get move over and
[1:01:49] lay it down and just chop it off say
[1:01:51] there it is think it
[1:01:52] over he's not hearing a physical body to
[1:01:55] those you said but they say where did he
[1:01:57] get the nail print that's because of the
[1:01:59] Revelation in their hearts that they
[1:02:01] have seen Jesus Christ and they know
[1:02:04] that he has nail prints in his
[1:02:06] hands and those nail prints was there to
[1:02:09] make you and I his bride but they'll
[1:02:11] know they have rejected that R
[1:02:15] amen and that they must give their lives
[1:02:17] for what they
[1:02:19] believe big man in this message when I
[1:02:22] first run into some brothers they said
[1:02:24] brother so and so says the 144,000 won't
[1:02:27] be killed the two witnesses won't I said
[1:02:29] well I don't know what brother so and so
[1:02:31] talking about because my Bible says they
[1:02:33] will that's right that's
[1:02:37] right if you want to change the Bible to
[1:02:40] fit so and so that's all right but it
[1:02:42] ain't all right with
[1:02:44] me I want to see what the word says amen
[1:02:49] right but you see a wonderful time is
[1:02:51] coming you and
[1:02:52] I as the bride of Christ right amen and
[1:02:56] this honeymoon won't be just for the end
[1:02:57] time
[1:02:58] bride no it'll be for the entire bride
[1:03:02] right all Seven Ages Ephesus M perus AR
[1:03:07] Philadelphia lady right the Bride of
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ will be there in at that
[1:03:14] marriage to the
[1:03:16] lamb and be there at the wedding
[1:03:21] supper and then we'll come into the
[1:03:23] Millennium when a honeymo amen
[1:03:29] now some of you know which way I'm
[1:03:31] fixing to go because the scriptures to
[1:03:33] written but some don't so let me just
[1:03:37] ask you some simple
[1:03:39] questions what do you think God thinks
[1:03:41] of
[1:03:47] you you don't ever sit down and just say
[1:03:49] Lord why in the world did you choose me
[1:03:55] never do that oh my said Lord I think
[1:03:59] about some of the most marvelous people
[1:04:02] of their lives and their doings and way
[1:04:04] they
[1:04:05] everything and
[1:04:07] then seemingly because can I quote
[1:04:10] brother RAM on
[1:04:12] that he said there were flaws down for
[1:04:15] each
[1:04:16] one that he
[1:04:19] chose that's in the church A's book
[1:04:21] paraphrasing he said he chose Moses that
[1:04:24] he had a flaw
[1:04:26] he chose
[1:04:27] everyone and you know he even chose and
[1:04:30] I remember this from B back years ago
[1:04:32] brother Mo and I were up our family up
[1:04:33] in the mountains and this man was
[1:04:35] talking about uh Joshua was a perfect
[1:04:37] type of Christ and I said that's right
[1:04:40] except for one
[1:04:42] thing he said what I said he had one
[1:04:46] flaw Joshua didn't have no
[1:04:49] flaws I said sure did yes sir I said I'm
[1:04:52] quoting brother brandom you know you you
[1:04:54] CLA to believe him
[1:04:57] think Joshua told his daddy and him to
[1:04:59] tell them they were sheep her no wasn't
[1:05:01] sheep herders they were cattle herders J
[1:05:04] goat they didn't want to be
[1:05:05] no sheep herders and goats they be be
[1:05:10] Catt he lied see that was brother
[1:05:12] Brandon when he come on out later he
[1:05:13] said see Joshua had one
[1:05:17] flaw but see everyone that's ever been
[1:05:19] chos and has got a flaw right that's
[1:05:22] right I'm looking at
[1:05:24] him whether you like it or not and
[1:05:26] you're looking at me so that's all right
[1:05:29] we just look at each other and see all
[1:05:30] the
[1:05:33] flaws that's what I talking today about
[1:05:35] so you just don't worry about it just
[1:05:38] take the word I preach cuz if you look
[1:05:40] at me you're going to find plenty of
[1:05:42] flaws right but look at the word see
[1:05:46] where it ties
[1:05:47] together but what do you think in God's
[1:05:49] word does he think of
[1:05:52] you if I can prove by the Bible
[1:05:56] and even the writings of the Bible so
[1:05:59] beautiful but what God thinks about you
[1:06:01] will you believe
[1:06:04] it amen amen we accept it right we
[1:06:10] accept it in stages
[1:06:13] as the marriage is in stages we're
[1:06:16] married to him now and we're being
[1:06:18] united with the son of man the word here
[1:06:21] in this end time of the Bri and one day
[1:06:24] we go to the marriage of the L
[1:06:29] right take all of those things that I've
[1:06:31] tried to get you to see because that way
[1:06:33] people just take a one-sided view on
[1:06:35] something and and you leave out a lot of
[1:06:37] beautiful
[1:06:40] things
[1:06:41] and you
[1:06:44] know what do you think
[1:06:46] about what God thinks of you
[1:06:57] I know I'm no English person and I'm not
[1:06:58] a
[1:06:59] theologian but I got a little
[1:07:03] sense in the
[1:07:06] Bible when a
[1:07:08] word a noun is the name of a person
[1:07:11] place or thing right
[1:07:14] right a pronoun is a one that would take
[1:07:18] the place of a
[1:07:19] noun and uh there is certain ways that
[1:07:23] the word he which always mostly would
[1:07:26] signify a
[1:07:28] pronoun but that word he if it's
[1:07:30] emphasized correctly can be a
[1:07:34] noun see that's where we miss
[1:07:38] it and if your Bible doesn't read this
[1:07:40] away and what I'm going to get
[1:07:42] through I'm not telling you to throw
[1:07:45] your Bible
[1:07:46] away I'm just saying some Bibles doesn't
[1:07:50] totally italicized
[1:07:52] words they don't use what is known in
[1:07:55] English is Major of a point of uppercase
[1:07:59] and
[1:08:00] lowercase you
[1:08:04] know have you ever noticed in the Bible
[1:08:07] that
[1:08:08] it'll it'll be great big letters
[1:08:12] sometimes
[1:08:15] yep and sometimes the word God is
[1:08:18] spelled g
[1:08:21] o d
[1:08:27] but sometimes it's spelled g
[1:08:30] o
[1:08:36] d
[1:08:38] uppercase lower
[1:08:45] case over in the book of Hebrews is the
[1:08:47] only time that you'll find Hebrews
[1:08:51] one the word god used in the form that
[1:08:54] it's truly meaning
[1:08:56] the big capital
[1:08:58] letters look in your Bible while you're
[1:09:01] while I'm talking if you want to see it
[1:09:04] it says God Andra times and divers
[1:09:06] maners that brother Joe can find that in
[1:09:07] a hurry Hebrews
[1:09:11] 1 he's got a great big D there great big
[1:09:19] G he said well it's because it starts a
[1:09:21] sentence
[1:09:26] now there's something else trying to be
[1:09:27] said
[1:09:28] there see now they don't even use it
[1:09:35] there but it's big letters
[1:09:40] God but see in John where speaking of it
[1:09:44] says God is a spirit that's a little
[1:09:46] bitty
[1:09:47] G's they using
[1:09:50] it see if you get in your Bible and look
[1:09:52] at it you'll see that Hebrews one will
[1:09:55] give you a big
[1:09:58] G all
[1:10:05] right if you got a Scofield bible
[1:10:08] especially you'll see this a big
[1:10:14] G now the best way for me to determine
[1:10:17] anything you'll find it over in Genesis
[1:10:20] if you read that it says God it'll say
[1:10:23] the little g o d
[1:10:27] but then after a while it'll
[1:10:28] say Lord God and Lord is in bold capital
[1:10:37] letters you're looking at it in reverse
[1:10:39] but I have to give it you know l o
[1:10:42] That's
[1:10:44] r
[1:10:47] d you say well what is that
[1:10:51] mean it means there's more of God being
[1:10:54] revealed
[1:10:56] and then in a little bit you'll find it
[1:10:57] in Genesis it'll say big G
[1:11:01] God and little L
[1:11:08] Lord that's in there for a reason
[1:11:10] because the
[1:11:13] writers the Scofield coming from the
[1:11:16] words to bring it down to
[1:11:21] us and brother R said you see he said
[1:11:25] where says God created all things in
[1:11:29] Genesis said really you read that
[1:11:34] Capital Elohim
[1:11:39] right
[1:11:42] Elohim but if you'll keep one thing in
[1:11:44] mind while you're reading and you'll see
[1:11:47] that it'll follow throughout the
[1:11:49] word then when he's using the little G
[1:11:52] and the little L it's always something
[1:11:54] God speaking down to earth to
[1:11:57] mankind down here but when they a riter
[1:12:01] like Abraham referring back and looking
[1:12:05] at
[1:12:06] him he's saying the god of
[1:12:09] Heaven come down to speak to
[1:12:14] me so you can be a little Lord you can
[1:12:17] be a little
[1:12:19] God
[1:12:21] no you remember the prophet in
[1:12:23] explaining it he said when there's a
[1:12:24] little e on the or little yeah Angel
[1:12:28] when there a little a he said that could
[1:12:30] be an Earthly Messenger right he said
[1:12:33] but when there's a big a there he said
[1:12:36] that's a Heavenly
[1:12:42] messenger see
[1:12:44] Church what I'm just trying to get you
[1:12:46] to see is God has trying his best to
[1:12:48] reveal himself amen right right amen and
[1:12:51] you go in in Matthew
[1:12:55] and you're reading in Matthew about the
[1:12:57] birth of
[1:12:59] Jesus and it gives his name one time as
[1:13:02] Jesus and it's very bold capital
[1:13:06] letters that's right but about two
[1:13:09] verses down it's back down to a lower
[1:13:12] case when it's referring to his name as
[1:13:15] the god of Heaven his name is
[1:13:22] Jesus he said well what's that got to do
[1:13:24] with what we talking talking
[1:13:26] about see after the Millennium I mean
[1:13:29] excuse me after the marriage supper
[1:13:32] right we're going to take a victory ride
[1:13:35] Y into the millennial Reign that's amen
[1:13:39] a lot of people preach standage we're
[1:13:41] going to come back fight a battle I just
[1:13:42] don't get it that way I don't think just
[1:13:44] something wrong you say yeah the
[1:13:46] scripture
[1:13:48] says but you're in glorified bodies what
[1:13:50] kind of a battle are you going to battle
[1:13:55] you see a lot of that battle is going on
[1:13:57] right now right here in your
[1:14:00] brain when some of you are sitting there
[1:14:02] saying what in the world is he talking
[1:14:06] about is he some kind of a doctor or
[1:14:08] lawyer
[1:14:13] or now old you something the Lord showed
[1:14:16] me a long time
[1:14:19] ago that when I look at things and I see
[1:14:22] that Capital LD
[1:14:26] it's all way through the
[1:14:28] Psalms and you look it'll be God
[1:14:31] speaking to
[1:14:32] [Music]
[1:14:36] me you find a little L that can be down
[1:14:39] here can actually be an angel or a
[1:14:46] person you remember when Jesus was
[1:14:48] talking he
[1:14:51] said they asked him a question he said
[1:14:54] let me ask you a question he said let's
[1:14:56] see if you'll answer it that's
[1:14:58] right he
[1:14:59] said David in the
[1:15:02] Psalms in the spirit or by the spirit
[1:15:06] which one it uses there said the Lord
[1:15:10] said unto my
[1:15:12] Lord
[1:15:15] yeah
[1:15:17] right Jesus said now he was
[1:15:20] Lord right lose his son yeah
[1:15:27] question they just got up and walked out
[1:15:31] cuz that's the best thing to do then you
[1:15:33] better say
[1:15:37] anymore but see what do you think that
[1:15:39] mean the Lord said unto my Lord Sit Down
[1:15:42] On th my Throne until I make thine
[1:15:44] enemies thy foot
[1:15:47] right is that two Gods two
[1:15:53] Lords no it's sh me
[1:15:56] that the god of Glory condescended down
[1:16:00] to mankind to reveal himself am
[1:16:06] Y and you'll find all the way through
[1:16:09] the New
[1:16:11] Testament that there's a middle case
[1:16:14] used of Jesus Christ except the one time
[1:16:18] that it says Jesus is in bold
[1:16:22] letter rest of the time it will be in a
[1:16:24] form of of a middle
[1:16:25] case not a lower and not
[1:16:29] upper because God was on
[1:16:32] Earth dwelling in a man amen
[1:16:38] right what is a wonderful opportunity
[1:16:41] then but let's look at what God does and
[1:16:44] uses for mankind go ahead brother Joan
[1:16:47] number8 and pull up the scripture in
[1:16:49] first
[1:16:53] Timothy and let's just look at the
[1:16:59] scriptures 1 Timothy
[1:17:04] 6:15 which in his time who's he talking
[1:17:08] about who's he talking about Jesus
[1:17:11] Christ
[1:17:12] right who is the blessed and only
[1:17:16] potentate they do have it right
[1:17:19] here the
[1:17:23] king for y of
[1:17:27] Kings read it yep go in your Bible and
[1:17:30] read
[1:17:31] it he's the king of
[1:17:35] kings and Lord of
[1:17:38] lords
[1:17:41] right who's that referring to we know
[1:17:44] who he
[1:17:46] is y we know who the king
[1:17:50] is but who's the
[1:17:52] Kings go amen right
[1:17:56] will you get over chapter 5 of The Book
[1:17:58] of
[1:18:02] Revelations you want to read it chapter
[1:18:05] 5 it says that we are
[1:18:09] Kings and
[1:18:11] priest that's right look it up and see
[1:18:14] if it ain't little cases that's right
[1:18:16] that's right you want to do it while I'm
[1:18:17] talking go ahead look it up and see if
[1:18:19] there little
[1:18:20] cases it doesn't say there in
[1:18:22] Revelations 5 no
[1:18:27] go at Revelations
[1:18:30] 5 the wedding is not complete n right
[1:18:37] right you say yes it is
[1:18:40] no there's something still withholding
[1:18:43] there so it's referring to us
[1:18:49] as do he's King of
[1:18:51] Kings it's referring here blessed is the
[1:18:54] only potentate the king of kings and
[1:18:57] Lord of
[1:19:01] lords he
[1:19:05] is right now look at Revelations because
[1:19:08] this is used three times in the Bible
[1:19:10] First Timothy 6:15 Revelation 17:14 and
[1:19:13] Revelation 19:16 is these words are used
[1:19:16] king of kings and Lord of lords you have
[1:19:18] King of Kings many other things you have
[1:19:20] Lords of Lords but these are the only
[1:19:22] times they appear together
[1:19:25] Revelation
[1:19:28] 17:14 getting on up there where the
[1:19:30] brides
[1:19:31] at bring their
[1:19:34] close these shall make war with the lamb
[1:19:36] and the lamb shall overcome them he is
[1:19:38] Lord of Lord and king of kings and they
[1:19:41] that are with him are
[1:19:43] called and chosen and
[1:19:49] faithful but you still don't have your
[1:19:51] Victory ride
[1:19:55] the finality of God revealing himself to
[1:19:57] mankind is not made known
[1:20:00] yet you say yeah but if we get to heaven
[1:20:03] that's all I want to do that's right
[1:20:05] that's
[1:20:06] good but I want to ride back with him
[1:20:09] into the
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:11] Millennium don't

[1:20:18] my people that I tried to preach
[1:20:21] Sunday and his wife has made herself
[1:20:24] ready
[1:20:25] and the marriage of the Lamb is
[1:20:30] come that's in Revelations 19 verse
[1:20:34] 7 now you're in verse
[1:20:38] 16 which is coming back into the
[1:20:43] Millennium
[1:20:44] right you want to quote downi you where
[1:20:47] the prophets in Daniel 70
[1:20:50] weeks that this is the victory ride yep
[1:20:54] this is the this is the ride of coming
[1:20:56] in this is us coming riding back so now
[1:20:58] look what it says re and he hath on his
[1:21:01] vesture on his th name
[1:21:03] written king of
[1:21:05] kings and Lord of
[1:21:08] lords all of is capital letter
[1:21:13] amen that's what he thinks about you
[1:21:20] amen until this thing is over with and
[1:21:23] we leave out of here and even when we
[1:21:24] leave out of here we go join him in the
[1:21:28] sky there's a wedding in the
[1:21:31] sky a very suffer and then a ride back
[1:21:35] into the Millennium y amen you know that
[1:21:37] brother Rand in Daniel 70 week says that
[1:21:40] when we ride back with him in the
[1:21:41] Millennium the anointing is upon on the
[1:21:45] bride to the Millennium
[1:21:50] Temple right
[1:21:53] mhm see when it gets over here up here
[1:21:57] the whole plan's not done in Timothy
[1:22:00] Revelations is still not
[1:22:03] finished but when you come into
[1:22:05] Revelations 17 is not Revelation
[1:22:09] 19 ain't no difference in him and you
[1:22:15] right I didn't write the
[1:22:21] book I didn't make the statement that
[1:22:23] the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the
[1:22:24] fullness of the godhead
[1:22:27] bodily I didn't write the book that says
[1:22:31] the bride will be the son of
[1:22:33] man those are statements your Prophet
[1:22:38] made that's what God thinks of
[1:22:44] you every what's written on his Sky is
[1:22:47] written on yours when you come riding
[1:22:49] back everybody wants to know what the
[1:22:51] new name is
[1:22:58] right but they think that some way if we
[1:23:00] find a new name we'll be able to get
[1:23:02] these bodies
[1:23:06] Chang I haven't exhausted or you use
[1:23:09] that word I haven't done away yet with
[1:23:10] the name of Jesus I'm still seeing
[1:23:15] things I said brother randam what about
[1:23:17] that new name he
[1:23:18] said referring to one part of it in the
[1:23:21] church ages he
[1:23:22] said maybe it'll be when we get when we
[1:23:25] get
[1:23:27] there but see that's what everybody
[1:23:29] thinks that it's got to be some kind of
[1:23:31] a new name and something that brother
[1:23:33] R's got to come back somewhere and tell
[1:23:35] us that new
[1:23:42] name it says there in the Book of
[1:23:44] Revelation that he has a name written
[1:23:45] that nobody knows but he himself that's
[1:23:48] right that's about verse 12 13 somewhere
[1:23:50] coming down to
[1:23:53] that but it says on that Revelations
[1:23:57] 19 that we're king of kings and Lord of
[1:24:01] lords and he has a name on his sty
[1:24:05] written which is the word of
[1:24:08] God what else do we
[1:24:14] need you mean brother Dale you're just
[1:24:16] trying to tell me that Jesus's name is
[1:24:17] the word of God that's what Jesus's name
[1:24:20] is is the word of God
[1:24:27] is that
[1:24:31] right his name Shall be Called
[1:24:37] Emmanuel why didn't they name him
[1:24:39] that they
[1:24:43] did that's right they
[1:24:46] did cuz Emmanuel means what God With Us
[1:24:51] right Jesus said unless you believe that
[1:24:54] I am he you will die in your sins
[1:25:00] that's brother Brown said the only name
[1:25:04] that God ever had is
[1:25:06] Jesus that's right
[1:25:09] amen Jehovah is not a name you even go
[1:25:12] back to the Old Testament said by my
[1:25:13] name Jehovah was I never
[1:25:16] known Yahweh is not a
[1:25:20] name Jesus is his name

[1:25:38] for to give me that name I got
[1:25:40] everything
[1:25:42] else when I was born I got all these
[1:25:44] virtues and things that just was in
[1:25:47] me brother said it wasn't n a you kind
[1:25:52] of missed the boat somewhere
[1:25:56] do you see my point of what I'm
[1:25:58] saying he thans so much of us
[1:26:02] until he doesn't
[1:26:07] separate you go ahead and pull that on
[1:26:09] up brother
[1:26:10] Joe just in case some of you think that
[1:26:13] even this the the strong concordance
[1:26:16] don't verify what I'm talking about pull
[1:26:17] that up to the J the Life part Brother
[1:26:21] Anderson I'm kind of hard on sometimes
[1:26:25] going up to the next

[1:26:40] Christ king of Israel leader of the
[1:26:41] people Prince Commander lord of the land
[1:26:45] King
[1:26:49] 9:36 Reign King to be king or to
[1:26:54] exercise kingly power to Reign to
[1:26:58] exercise the highest influence to
[1:27:05] control and Timothy when it uses it's
[1:27:08] talking about him as Lord is this
[1:27:12] word King of
[1:27:15] Kings King of
[1:27:19] Kings that's in Timothy King of Kings
[1:27:23] the god of glory and his
[1:27:27] people to be king to exercise kingly
[1:27:31] Revelation 17 it is two-part word
[1:27:36] King and
[1:27:41] Kings Revelations 19 verse 16 it is both
[1:27:48] 9:35 you go read it when you home
[1:27:55] he's showing what we're going to be amen
[1:27:57] that's right but why can't we believe
[1:27:59] we're already amen at least we ought to
[1:28:02] believe that we're Kings and Priests
[1:28:06] right y you
[1:28:08] know and if we're Kings we got to have
[1:28:10] something to rule
[1:28:12] over and we're supposed to be ruling
[1:28:14] over
[1:28:17] sin
[1:28:19] right we're supposed to be getting
[1:28:22] ready well we're in the stage on the
[1:28:24] earth we'll wind up with those little
[1:28:26] Kings all the time but when we come back
[1:28:29] riding in the Millennium you'll be king
[1:28:31] of
[1:28:32] kings he shows no difference between him
[1:28:34] and her right
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:39] amen see if you think things don't work
[1:28:41] out look over in the scripture there
[1:28:43] where he's talking about
[1:28:45] Elijah when it says
[1:28:49] that it be capital letter
[1:28:55] turn in your Bible while you're looking
[1:28:56] I can't remember the scripture but some
[1:28:57] of you can call it out and when Moses
[1:29:00] went to the burning
[1:29:05] bush you get a chance read
[1:29:10] it when it says I am that I
[1:29:16] am they're all in capital
[1:29:20] letter I am that I am amen
[1:29:25] there was no angel talking to Moses
[1:29:28] no right that's right it was God
[1:29:36] himself do I need to
[1:29:39] quote we don't believe in brother Brown
[1:29:41] being de i' done been through that a
[1:29:42] minute
[1:29:43] ago but you know there is a tape there
[1:29:46] where that brother brandom is speaking
[1:29:48] and all at once God uses his voice and
[1:29:51] said you're not hearing William brandom
[1:29:53] said you're hearing
[1:29:58] me
[1:30:00] well that shouldn't have be hard to
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:05] understand shouldn't be hard to
[1:30:07] understand when a prophet says that a
[1:30:09] born again Christian take the word of
[1:30:11] God on his lips and speaks it he said
[1:30:14] it's deity speaking amen that's right
[1:30:17] there shouldn't be any problem
[1:30:19] right but yet we belittle ourselves and
[1:30:22] we don't try to look at What God Says
[1:30:24] about us amen that's
[1:30:28] right you see I like to talk to other
[1:30:30] people cuz I get things talking to other
[1:30:32] people they think I don't they think I'm
[1:30:33] sitting there thinking I'm going know it
[1:30:35] all they don't know nothing they don't
[1:30:36] know nothing but my mind's running when
[1:30:39] you're
[1:30:41] talking brother Mark was explaining
[1:30:43] something yesterday and he said he
[1:30:45] doesn't say a lot he's kind of quiet you
[1:30:47] know
[1:30:48] but he said that old man he said I saw
[1:30:51] it back there in that Old Testament said
[1:30:52] when that man walks up there and L his
[1:30:54] hand on that
[1:30:55] lamb and that priest cuts that
[1:30:58] throat he said that man has got to
[1:31:01] believe his sins goes in that lamb the
[1:31:04] price was paid
[1:31:07] all is you're exactly right
[1:31:10] Y and I said but brother we got to
[1:31:14] believe that when Jesus Christ
[1:31:18] died he died for my sins amen
[1:31:24] amen that man went away free from his
[1:31:27] sin but somebody just hasely walk up
[1:31:30] just throw a lamb down say here
[1:31:32] sacrifice that and I'm going out and do
[1:31:33] it again his sins wasn't forgiven I've
[1:31:37] never believ that if you do you're I
[1:31:39] want to sell you some stocking alcatra
[1:31:41] or
[1:31:44] something but listen
[1:31:47] church if we can't believe Jesus Christ
[1:31:49] paid the price
[1:31:55] then we're missing our Salvation that's
[1:31:57] right amen that's right he became me
[1:32:00] that I might become him
[1:32:02] right right come on you
[1:32:06] s Victory ride we come riding back into
[1:32:09] the Millennium as Victorious not as even
[1:32:13] just Little
[1:32:15] Kings not as little
[1:32:17] priests
[1:32:21] no brother BR said the anting will be on
[1:32:24] that bride to anoint that
[1:32:28] Temple but you know what that's just a
[1:32:32] victory ride because a red you there out
[1:32:34] of the future home where he said it was
[1:32:36] just just a journey going right on the
[1:32:38] end of that future
[1:32:42] home going to be a wonderful place in
[1:32:45] the future
[1:32:47] home we W be looking down on each other
[1:32:50] you w be looking down on somebody else
[1:32:51] and say boy I'm bigger than you are I'm
[1:32:53] great than you are I'm
[1:32:55] Bri you w even be there you got they got
[1:32:58] a lake of fire for them to yeah
[1:33:05] right you see people should read the
[1:33:07] Bible with what brother Bram
[1:33:13] says when he made this
[1:33:16] statement and then I was reading the
[1:33:18] scriptures I
[1:33:19] thought that's hard to get brother
[1:33:22] Brown brother R said no man will be cast
[1:33:25] into hell without being judged
[1:33:28] first you
[1:33:30] agree you need a
[1:33:34] quote and that would be at the whiteone
[1:33:37] Judgment
[1:33:39] right
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:43] y but you need to go read your Bible
[1:33:45] That's
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:48] right The Beast and the false prophet
[1:33:52] are cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:33:54] before y the
[1:33:58] white read your
[1:34:02] Bible Satan
[1:34:07] yep will be cast in the Lake of Fire
[1:34:10] TR but you beast in your false
[1:34:16] prophet it's not meaning
[1:34:19] listen it's not
[1:34:22] meaning people
[1:34:25] because you'd be R around him you'd miss
[1:34:27] him he said everybody's got to be
[1:34:31] judged see the Beast and the false
[1:34:33] prophet is a symbolic
[1:34:37] symbol because it takes many to make the
[1:34:41] Beast there were many false
[1:34:45] prophets does it mean all that would be
[1:34:48] false prophets be cast down and all it
[1:34:50] would be the Beast no no no we're not
[1:34:52] getting it
[1:34:56] it's a symbolic
[1:34:59] form showing what God thinks of it just
[1:35:03] like he burns
[1:35:09] Babylon he burns
[1:35:14] Babylon the Beast and the false prophet
[1:35:16] is not just counting human people it's a
[1:35:20] symbolic form
[1:35:26] you see now I know why the prophet could
[1:35:27] say
[1:35:28] it he said God cast no man into hell in
[1:35:31] first until he's first
[1:35:33] judged the Beast and the false prophet
[1:35:35] is not human beings it's a symbolic form
[1:35:38] of
[1:35:45] understanding see because Satan's cast
[1:35:47] in later
[1:35:57] Satan don't have to be judged he's
[1:35:58] already
[1:36:01] judged he judged himself before the
[1:36:04] world cuz he's not a human being
[1:36:09] right if you're following me y you'll
[1:36:13] understand y the Beast and the false
[1:36:16] prophet Is Not a Human
[1:36:20] Being Satan is not a human being
[1:36:27] he's real yes but he's an Angelic being
[1:36:29] right so is the Beast and the false
[1:36:36] prophet you see church if we just take
[1:36:39] the
[1:36:40] scriptures by theel we'll run a ground
[1:36:42] if we just take the Prophet by itself
[1:36:44] we'll run a ground if we keep getting it
[1:36:46] together it'll just keep
[1:36:50] unfolding Satan can be cast into the
[1:36:53] Lake of Fire
[1:36:59] but he's Bound for a thousand years is
[1:37:00] the reason he's
[1:37:02] not look at him there he's bound during
[1:37:06] a thousand
[1:37:08] years but you don't have to be judged
[1:37:10] cuz he's not a human being
[1:37:13] right he said yeah but the Bible say
[1:37:15] We'll judge Angels what what judgement
[1:37:17] what is it doing an angel is not a human
[1:37:20] being
[1:37:25] you said I think there some things we're
[1:37:26] missing
[1:37:29] right let's
[1:37:30] stand 94 spiral just remember what he
[1:37:35] thinks about you there going to be a
[1:37:37] victory ride right into the
[1:37:41] millenum on white horses with
[1:37:44] him not to fight but
[1:37:47] to you have
[1:37:51] heard victory Victory ride is not a
[1:37:56] battle that battle's going on right
