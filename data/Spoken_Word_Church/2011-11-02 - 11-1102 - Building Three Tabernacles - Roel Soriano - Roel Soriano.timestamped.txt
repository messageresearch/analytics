[14:25] and it makes it just makes you feel at
[14:28] home last year i think i mentioned to
[14:31] you that um
[14:34] we were in the process of building a
[14:36] church
[14:38] and uh
[14:39] in january as us
[14:42] talking to a brother to
[14:44] dale's uh son i forgot to say
[14:49] okay
[14:50] and uh
[14:51] us telling you about the dedication of
[14:53] our church we're going to dedicate our
[14:55] church in
[14:56] january i think louise and sister
[14:59] christine is gonna
[15:00] try to make that one to make it to the
[15:02] philippines so
[15:05] uh
[15:06] i just would like to share with you
[15:08] um
[15:10] some pictures that we took of the
[15:12] uh
[15:14] building but first uh
[15:16] let me just testify that in
[15:19] the year 2009
[15:21] there was a
[15:22] big typhoon that came to metro manila
[15:26] and it flooded most of the
[15:29] 14
[15:30] cities of metro manila
[15:32] and in the place where we were having
[15:35] services there was 15 feet of
[15:38] water and we just lost everything you
[15:42] know the church equipment instruments
[15:44] everything we just uh
[15:45] and so uh
[15:47] it
[15:48] necessitated the
[15:50] need to go look for a place
[15:54] that's situated on higher ground
[15:57] and
[15:58] we've been saving for 10 years
[16:01] saving money for 10 years to buy a lot
[16:04] and there was 4 dollars in our account
[16:09] but we
[16:11] we found this law
[16:12] uh and it's
[16:14] a six thousand square foot of
[16:16] uh
[16:17] land in a business
[16:20] a central business district of the
[16:23] town of taitai just outside outside of
[16:26] manila
[16:27] uh it's on the foot situated on the foot
[16:29] of a mountain which is much higher
[16:32] altitude than metro manila
[16:35] and the cost was
[16:38] eighty thousand dollars u.s
[16:41] we only had four thousand right
[16:44] and uh when we had a meeting in church
[16:47] uh the brothers said there's just no way
[16:51] we can start negotiating we only have 4
[16:53] 000 in our coffers
[16:54] and i said of course there's a way
[16:57] we can pray
[17:00] and we organize what we call a
[17:03] a chain
[17:04] chain prayer or prayer chain
[17:06] where believers take turns um praying
[17:10] for two hours at a time
[17:12] uh for the whole month of june 24 7.
[17:16] it's like we were bombarding heaven with
[17:19] our prayers
[17:21] with the petition of
[17:22] um uh
[17:24] the lord providing for a lot for us
[17:27] and also a building
[17:29] because what good would a lot do we
[17:34] and
[17:37] mid july we were able to pay the down
[17:40] payment of the lot
[17:42] and in january this year um
[17:45] it was fully paid
[17:54] don't ask me where the money came from
[17:58] because it came from uh uh people we
[18:00] didn't even expect uh have money right
[18:04] amen
[18:05] and then it was time for us to
[18:08] uh
[18:08] build the
[18:10] uh build a church
[18:12] i'm an engineer so i designed the whole
[18:14] thing
[18:15] and i asked the brother to uh draw the
[18:18] plans for me
[18:20] and uh we estimated the cost
[18:23] to be 120 000
[18:27] and we had nothing because this you know
[18:31] we used everything
[18:32] on the purchase of the lot and we had
[18:34] nothing
[18:36] so i told them we need to pray again
[18:40] in the month of august we started
[18:42] excavating the foundation
[18:46] and on december 19 the same year
[18:49] 2010 last year
[18:52] we were able to use the facility for our
[18:54] services
[19:00] center
[19:02] there's a picture of the sanctuary there
[19:05] hey man
[19:07] next
[19:12] uh and that's the balcony you know where
[19:16] about 100 people
[19:18] more people can um sit in the next
[19:21] picture
[19:22] see
[19:35] that's our planter
[19:39] and that's a one day old garden
[19:43] my brothers they do this for a living
[19:45] you know
[19:46] landscaping so they planted the plants
[19:48] in the morning i took a picture in the
[19:50] afternoon
[19:53] so as you can see we're still working on
[19:54] the left side of the building yeah
[19:59] and that's a view from the platform
[20:04] that's another view amen
[20:09] and that's the third floor if you notice
[20:12] the the facade part of it and the front
[20:14] part of it is three stories
[20:16] second floor is the balcony and the
[20:18] third floor is we're using this to
[20:21] uh hold uh some fellowship you know in
[20:24] the church like a first fellowship room
[20:26] you can see it in this next picture but
[20:29] we're using it already
[20:35] the spoiler
[20:36] that's the restroom
[20:38] and on top of it we're building a
[20:41] parsonage where the ministers from
[20:43] from the country and from uh from
[20:46] overseas can come and stay
[20:49] amen
[20:50] that's the view deck
[20:52] that's the fourth level actually um
[20:55] we use it um we planned it to be a view
[20:58] deck because
[20:59] you see a fantastic view of the mountain
[21:01] on the left side and on the right side
[21:03] you see the skyline of metro manila
[21:07] so
[21:07] that's the roof
[21:11] and as you can see we were still using
[21:13] plastic chairs
[21:17] and then we built the the kills
[21:19] we built it ourselves
[21:21] we built it out of mango trees
[21:27] so that's the parsonage
[21:29] and the restrooms
[21:32] and we're we're working our our prime
[21:35] room it's unfinished now
[21:38] we're supposed to put a
[21:40] glass door in between the sign curry
[21:42] and fry room
[21:46] and we just want to thank you for paying
[21:48] for us
[22:09] and it has proven to be a tremendous
[22:11] blessing not only to our
[22:13] congregation but
[22:15] other church groups as well in the
[22:17] message
[22:19] because we hosted
[22:21] four or five conventions already
[22:24] we hosted in august we hosted a a youth
[22:27] convention
[22:29] where
[22:29] more than 400 uh young people from
[22:32] five or six different churches in metro
[22:34] manila
[22:35] came together
[22:37] and
[22:38] uh there's about three or four
[22:42] weddings lined up already for the end of
[22:44] the year
[22:45] it used to be that uh
[22:47] we were using um denominational
[22:50] facilities for special functions like
[22:52] weddings and it's not always easy to
[22:55] rent them you know
[22:57] because they want to know if you believe
[22:58] the trinity
[23:01] and but now we're so thankful we're so
[23:04] happy that we have something that we can
[23:06] call our own amen
[23:08] amen thank you because
[23:10] and i want you to be continue to pray
[23:12] for us
[23:13] because we're still working on it as you
[23:15] can see
[23:16] okay
[23:18] thank you lord
[23:20] this is my water
[23:26] okay now we go to the word of god
[23:29] the soul stand
[23:33] i'm going to speak
[23:35] on the subject which i entitled building
[23:38] three tabernacles
[23:40] building three tabernacles
[23:45] and our scripture reading is in
[23:48] matthew chapter 17 and verse one
[23:52] till the eighth verse
[23:54] of course the background of this is
[23:57] um
[23:58] jesus was speaking to the disciples and
[24:00] he said
[24:01] uh
[24:02] some of you who are standing here will
[24:06] not see death until they see the until
[24:09] you see the son of man coming in his
[24:11] kingdom
[24:12] and in in the first verse of matthew 17
[24:16] says here after six days
[24:19] six days after he said that right after
[24:22] six days jesus jesus take pierre james
[24:26] and john his brother
[24:28] and bring them up onto a high mountain
[24:31] apart
[24:32] and was
[24:34] transfigured before them right
[24:36] his face did shine as the sun and his
[24:40] raymond was white as light
[24:43] and behold there appeared unto them
[24:45] moses and elias
[24:48] talking with him amen and then answered
[24:51] peter and said unto jesus lord it is
[24:54] good for us to be here
[24:56] if thou wilt
[24:57] let us make here free tabernacles one
[25:00] for thee one for moses and one for elias
[25:05] while he
[25:06] but what he had spake behold a bright
[25:09] cloud overshadow them and behold a voice
[25:13] out of the cloud which said this is my
[25:16] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[25:20] hear ye him amen and when the disciples
[25:24] heard it they fell on their face and
[25:26] were so so afraid and jesus came and
[25:30] touched them and said arise and be not
[25:33] afraid and when they had lifted up their
[25:36] eyes they saw no man save jesus only
[25:40] amen
[25:41] let us pray father
[25:43] we commit this service to you lord
[25:46] and we're asking lord as we humble
[25:48] ourselves
[25:49] that you come lord anoint the speaker
[25:53] and the hearers alike lord jesus that we
[25:55] may come to a clear understanding lord
[25:58] of what you have in mind for us lord
[26:01] tonight
[26:03] we want you to take all glory and honor
[26:06] in the service lord in jesus name we
[26:07] pray amen
[26:15] amen
[26:22] when jesus said some of you
[26:25] standing here
[26:27] will not see that or taste of that until
[26:30] you see the the
[26:32] son of man coming coming in his kingdom
[26:35] so jesus was actually talking about the
[26:37] coming of the lord right right amen
[26:41] the second coming of the lord
[26:44] and uh
[26:47] some of the disciples
[26:50] actually you were placing it way into
[26:52] the future
[26:54] and well we found out in matt in the
[26:56] 17th chapter
[26:58] that this happened six days after jesus
[27:01] made a statement all right
[27:04] and it says here after six days right
[27:06] right after six days is the seventh day
[27:10] hallelujah
[27:12] and uh uh
[27:15] oh
[27:16] and of course uh um
[27:19] we can say
[27:20] uh
[27:21] that uh the seven days spoken of here um
[27:25] represents the seven church ages
[27:28] and it's on the seventh day
[27:31] of the seventh day is when the
[27:34] revelation of the coming of the lord
[27:36] will come to the church
[27:38] amen
[27:39] hallelujah all right
[27:43] and uh
[27:45] we see here that
[27:47] not everyone was called to go to the
[27:50] mountaintop with jesus
[27:52] not all of the disciples that's right
[27:54] but only
[27:55] uh
[27:56] peter james and john
[27:59] so that tells you
[28:01] that
[28:02] all of us will not come to the same
[28:04] revelation same level of revelation at
[28:07] the same time
[28:10] sometimes we may have to depend on our
[28:13] brothers sharing with us right
[28:19] and
[28:20] uh we see here in in in second peter
[28:24] chapter 1 verse 16
[28:26] when peter was talking about this
[28:28] experience that he had
[28:32] on this mountain second peter chapter 1
[28:34] verse 16. if you can just turn with me
[28:37] we'll read it together
[28:40] peter said we have not followed
[28:44] cunningly devised fables
[28:46] when we made known unto you the power
[28:50] and coming of our lord jesus christ
[28:53] exactly but were eyewitnesses of his
[28:57] majesty he's talking about the power and
[29:00] the coming of our lord jesus christ
[29:03] i think he's talking about the seventh
[29:05] seal here
[29:06] the coming of the lord jesus christ
[29:09] verse 17 but he was he received he
[29:13] jesus received from god the father
[29:16] honor and glory
[29:19] when there came such a voice to him
[29:22] from the excellent glory this is my
[29:25] beloved son
[29:26] in whom i am well pleased
[29:30] and this voice which came from heaven we
[29:32] heard when we were with him in the holy
[29:36] mountain
[29:37] right and that's when
[29:39] peter james and john looked at the lord
[29:41] and he was transfigured before them amen
[29:45] right his image became glorious before
[29:48] them right that's right and
[29:52] according to the words of peter this was
[29:54] the father's
[29:56] honor and glory being bestowed to the
[29:59] son
[30:01] hallelujah
[30:03] now
[30:06] what do you do with the scripture in
[30:09] isaiah chapter 42 verse 8 where it says
[30:12] i am the lord and that is my name and my
[30:16] glory will i will i not give to another
[30:19] neither my praise to raven images
[30:23] exactly amen
[30:25] now
[30:27] these two verses seem to contradict each
[30:29] other right
[30:31] because here the father peter said
[30:34] the father gave honor and glory to his
[30:36] son on that mountain
[30:39] hallelujah but in isaiah chapter 42 he
[30:43] said i am god i am the lord
[30:46] and i my glory will i not give to
[30:49] another
[30:50] neither my place to get driven images
[30:54] then why did the father
[30:56] give his glory to the son then
[30:59] according to the words of saint saint
[31:01] peter
[31:03] hallelujah
[31:05] that's because the first person of the
[31:07] father and the person of the son amen is
[31:11] the same
[31:12] amen
[31:13] they are one person
[31:15] there's a teaching now that goes around
[31:18] it's it's uh it's been to our country
[31:21] and uh certain elements trying to
[31:24] convince people message churches that
[31:27] the trinitarians are wrong because they
[31:28] believe in three persons and the oneness
[31:31] are wrong because they believe in one
[31:32] person
[31:34] because
[31:35] god they say is actually two persons
[31:38] the father and the son
[31:41] two persons
[31:43] i i guess they call it two lords
[31:44] doctrine right
[31:46] hallelujah all right
[31:49] let me tell you what
[31:50] amen
[31:53] isaiah said
[31:54] god through the lips of isaiah said i
[31:57] will not give my glory to another
[32:01] amen hallelujah when he gave his glory
[32:04] to his son he did not actually give it
[32:06] to another right
[32:08] amen
[32:10] because
[32:11] the son and the father is the same
[32:13] person
[32:15] amen hallelujah
[32:17] i want you to hold on to that thought
[32:18] now right now because the story doesn't
[32:21] end there amen hallelujah
[32:24] thank you jesus
[32:26] and uh we read in a church age book
[32:29] literacy and church age
[32:32] burban speaking about the capstone
[32:34] revelation
[32:35] he said it very clearly and now
[32:38] in this last age we have come back to
[32:41] the capstone revelation
[32:43] it is the most important revelation
[32:47] that's right of godhead
[32:49] in the whole bible
[32:52] and that is
[32:53] jesus is god
[32:55] right he and the father are one amen and
[32:59] there is one god
[33:01] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[33:07] but we can put it any prayer
[33:10] hallelujah
[33:12] don't let anybody try to sway you away
[33:15] from this revelation this is called the
[33:17] capstone revelation
[33:21] that's the reason the amount of
[33:22] transfiguration happened on the
[33:24] mountaintop
[33:26] amen hallelujah
[33:29] thank you jesus
[33:31] and peter in his unconverted state
[33:34] when exposed to the supernatural right
[33:38] to the presence of god
[33:40] he was overwhelmed right
[33:42] and he didn't know he didn't know what
[33:44] to do he wanted to build three
[33:46] denominations right there
[33:50] right
[33:51] oh my
[33:52] of course we prioritize the lord we're
[33:54] gonna build three tabernacles one for
[33:57] you and one for moses and one for elijah
[34:00] yeah
[34:03] he is doing the lord some paper because
[34:06] he was number one
[34:09] hallelujah
[34:11] but moses
[34:13] as great
[34:14] as great as a prophet moses was
[34:17] you
[34:18] know he
[34:20] came to egypt as a one-on-one one-man
[34:23] army one like invasion vervain said
[34:26] and set the people up
[34:28] set the people of god free
[34:31] he parted the red sea all right man
[34:33] hallelujah
[34:34] what a ministry this prophet had right
[34:37] hallelujah but as plaintiff ministry
[34:39] moses had
[34:41] god is showing us
[34:43] that we are not to build a tabernacle in
[34:47] honor of moses
[34:49] amen don't build a tabernacle from moses
[34:54] hallelujah
[34:55] don't feel a tabernacle for elijah
[34:59] hallelujah
[35:00] because as great as a ministry elijah
[35:03] was hallelujah
[35:05] he is still a person right yeah yes
[35:08] he's a sinner
[35:10] hallelujah saved by the grace of god
[35:13] hallelujah
[35:14] nothing more like you and me
[35:16] it's a special vessel oh by which the
[35:19] lord
[35:21] spoke to the people hallelujah
[35:24] he was not god
[35:26] hallelujah elijah could not save anybody
[35:30] all right exactly hallelujah we have one
[35:32] savior and that's the lord jesus christ
[35:36] that is why
[35:38] uh before even peter uh ended his
[35:40] statement
[35:42] a bright cloud over shadow man
[35:45] hallelujah this this is god and the lord
[35:48] the envelope in his disciples
[35:50] the believers with his presence i see uh
[35:54] to keep them from being deceived right
[35:56] amen
[36:02] and they were afraid
[36:04] right but the lord touched them right
[36:06] amen and they when they when they uh
[36:09] looked up
[36:11] they saw
[36:13] no one there but jesus only amen
[36:16] see god god is
[36:19] um
[36:20] showing them that
[36:22] um
[36:23] that only jesus deserved to be
[36:25] worshipped
[36:27] jesus deserve to receive honor and glory
[36:31] hallelujah yes sir all right
[36:34] bless you
[36:37] praise god
[36:39] okay
[36:40] they actually saw
[36:42] the coming of the lord right or right
[36:46] uh
[36:47] simply paul it is actually the preview
[36:50] of the glorious coming of the
[36:52] lord amen from the son of god all right
[36:55] man hallelujah
[36:56] we read in luke chapter 16 and verse 16
[37:00] the law and the prophets were until john
[37:04] right
[37:06] since that time the prophets were
[37:09] since that time the kingdom of god is
[37:11] preached
[37:12] and every man
[37:14] pressed it into it right
[37:16] hallelujah amen so they saw
[37:19] jesus amen exactly and moses
[37:24] hallelujah which represented the law
[37:27] right
[37:28] elijah
[37:29] represented the prophets
[37:32] that's actually the old testament right
[37:35] this scripture doesn't mean there'll be
[37:38] no prophets after john the baptist
[37:42] but this scripture
[37:44] actually means that
[37:47] after
[37:48] after the
[37:49] old testament
[37:50] comes christ
[37:53] hallelujah after the old testament comes
[37:57] john the baptist who introduced the new
[37:59] testament in the person of christ
[38:02] john the baptist message was there he is
[38:05] the lamb of god that takes away the sins
[38:08] of the world right exactly is that right
[38:11] hallelujah
[38:13] so
[38:17] god was saying don't be the tabernacle
[38:19] for moses
[38:20] or elijah right right now how many knows
[38:23] that we have a moses today oh yeah right
[38:27] and that's better
[38:28] right yeah mother branham
[38:30] is our moses for today
[38:33] hallelujah he was the one
[38:35] that set us free from denominational
[38:37] bonding
[38:38] amen he got us out of egypt
[38:42] hallelujah
[38:44] but he is also our elijah exactly
[38:48] that's right hallelujah moses and elijah
[38:51] amen bundled together in one person
[38:55] hallelujah glory what does that tell us
[39:00] we're not supposed to build a tabernacle
[39:02] for moses or for elijah all right
[39:05] amen we're not supposed to build a
[39:07] tabernacle for our moses and our elijah
[39:09] today
[39:11] amen
[39:27] for jesus amen
[39:29] hallelujah
[39:32] you know god did not even allow peter to
[39:36] build a tabernacle for jesus
[39:39] hallelujah
[39:41] if he allowed it then
[39:43] he would have a reason to go to that
[39:44] mountain i think it's not mount olives
[39:48] right
[39:49] go to the mountains and be on a
[39:51] pilgrimage
[39:54] that's why god did not allow it
[39:57] hallelujah and what is a tabernacle the
[40:00] tabernacle is a shelter
[40:03] it's like a house
[40:05] exactly and what do you
[40:07] why we build a house
[40:11] it's to shelter and protect those that
[40:14] are going to live in the house right
[40:18] so
[40:20] what was peter's intention i'm going to
[40:22] shelter god oh yeah
[40:25] i want to shelter i want to build
[40:28] a house for jesus
[40:32] hallelujah
[40:35] it's a safe you know he was trying to do
[40:38] a service
[40:39] to god right right and help him
[40:44] it reminds me of
[40:46] one time when the great king david
[40:50] he was looking out the window of his
[40:52] terrace yeah of his great palace
[40:55] and he was probably pondering how the
[40:57] lord has blessed him right oh yeah
[41:00] hallelujah and then he's
[41:02] you know he's living in this house big
[41:04] house of
[41:06] cedars
[41:07] and he happened to look where the lord
[41:11] was living at that time
[41:13] and the lord was in a tent right
[41:17] and david felt so bad that he was living
[41:20] in a palace
[41:21] and he's god that blessed him right he's
[41:24] god of whom he's a servant glory
[41:27] is still living inside a tent right
[41:30] right
[41:32] and so he called nathan the prophet
[41:35] he said nathan
[41:37] i want you to tell god
[41:40] i'm going to build him a house amen
[41:43] so he david thinks he's
[41:45] he's
[41:46] he's doing god's service right oh yeah
[41:49] david thinks you know he feels feeling
[41:52] sorry for god now yeah
[41:55] after the lord has blessed him
[41:58] hallelujah
[41:59] well
[42:00] in the book of elections chapter 2 verse
[42:02] 13 it says for it is god which worketh
[42:05] in you both to will and to do of his
[42:08] good pleasure exactly even the will to
[42:12] serve god
[42:13] even the revelation the faith that give
[42:16] god hallelujah in believing god
[42:18] hallelujah
[42:20] it comes from god right now we got it
[42:22] from him right amen you have nothing to
[42:25] offer god right right amen hallelujah
[42:29] you think you're talented
[42:32] yeah
[42:34] you think you're prosperous
[42:37] you can help god
[42:39] hallelujah yeah there's nothing you can
[42:41] offer right
[42:54] we cannot help god right right right
[42:57] hallelujah god will help you
[43:00] but you cannot help god
[43:02] and peter wants to protect god you can't
[43:06] protect god right god will protect you
[43:09] all right amen
[43:13] you know they
[43:15] they like to write books
[43:18] and because they wanted to preserve
[43:20] the purity of the message oh yeah yeah
[43:23] and they wanted to uh protect the
[43:26] message
[43:29] you can't protect the message
[43:32] the message will protect you
[43:36] hallelujah
[43:38] the message is a life of its own all
[43:40] right
[43:41] hallelujah
[43:43] exactly that's why i
[43:45] i think it's ridiculous that some people
[43:47] claim to have a franchise of the message
[43:52] they want to protect the message yeah
[43:55] hallelujah
[43:59] in 1964 going beyond the calm
[44:03] peter branham spoke what hap spoke about
[44:05] that happened on a month of
[44:07] transpiration and he said what did they
[44:09] see after his voice spoke to them
[44:12] even moses and elijah wasn't present
[44:15] right
[44:16] neither was their creed nope right
[44:19] neither was anything left but jesus
[44:22] only
[44:23] amen and he
[44:25] is the word amen
[44:28] that's all they see right now hallelujah
[44:33] so
[44:34] god was
[44:36] trying to veer them away
[44:38] from the personalities of moses and
[44:41] elijah
[44:43] and direct them to jesus only right and
[44:46] he is the word
[44:49] hallelujah god does not want us to to be
[44:52] following men
[44:54] hallelujah he wants us to take the head
[44:57] shape of the word
[45:00] that's right
[45:03] exploits in 1953
[45:06] i said if you start in your
[45:08] organizations

[45:11] back around personalities of this earth
[45:15] yeah
[45:16] yeah and you're going and you're going
[45:18] to have the same thing that we got now
[45:21] he said
[45:22] don't build it around any certain
[45:26] organization right or any certain person
[45:30] but build it around jesus christ amen
[45:34] that's right amen right now i'm trusting
[45:36] by the tale
[45:38] that this building
[45:39] has been erected by the honor and glory
[45:43] of jesus christ alone amen exactly right
[45:47] not to some
[45:48] to the honor of or to the glory of some
[45:51] organization or some person

[45:57] put it around christ
[46:00] hallelujah
[46:04] fellowship by redemption 1955. listen to
[46:07] this but when you see so many things
[46:10] rise up under flattery

[46:15] personalities right then you are going
[46:18] to be setting on sinking sandwiches
[46:20] right amen all right

[46:26] hallelujah because they rally around a
[46:29] certain personality all right that's all

[46:35] to promote any personality that's right
[46:38] i'm here to promote christ alone all

[48:18] that's right hallelujah amen
[48:26] a denominational church
[48:28] is a church that is led by man right now

[48:59] headed
[49:00] by the lord jesus christ
[49:03] amen
[49:04] no two ways about it right but said
[49:08] denominationalism is a carnal church
[49:11] system that separates brotherhood right
[49:13] oh amen hallelujah it's not a guaranteed
[49:16] guarantee that you call yourself a
[49:18] message
[49:19] hallelujah that you'll be free from
[49:21] denominationalism come on
[49:23] amen hallelujah all right amen that's
[49:27] right
[49:30] because the system that holds this
[49:32] church

[49:40] i hate believers
[49:42] uh
[49:45] they they can talk about
[49:47] uh
[49:48] nothing else but their church

[50:14] and verb said trying to out do yeah
[50:17] the next church
[50:18] trying to build the biggest church
[50:21] the bigger from the next church
[50:22] hallelujah than the next church i should
[50:25] say hallelujah it's a carnal system
[50:28] that separates brotherhood
[50:33] that's right call yourself a message
[50:37] if you want but you know if you still
[50:40] have the spirit in you
[50:42] hallelujah
[50:43] you're still in the denomination right
[50:44] right
[50:46] that's right
[50:48] if you can fellowship
[50:50] with other without a checks group
[50:54] and
[50:54] if you can if you find it hard to work
[50:57] together with other believers
[50:59] in advancing the cause and all you see
[51:01] is your efforts
[51:04] all you see is your own local church
[51:05] come on
[51:06] hallelujah you become a denomination
[51:11] that's right it's true you know family
[51:15] stops
[51:16] going to church
[51:18] because
[51:19] they couldn't find the perfect church
[51:21] yeah all right so they just stay home
[51:25] and just play tapes
[51:28] and have service in the house
[51:31] hallelujah i call that a denominational
[51:33] family
[51:36] because in reality they can't they're
[51:38] not able to submit themselves to nothing
[51:40] right
[51:41] hallelujah
[51:42] but their own principles their own rules
[51:45] right right hallelujah
[51:47] amen you know that you can be one
[51:49] individual
[51:51] and be a denomination by yourself
[51:53] that's right amen you know people like
[51:55] that
[51:56] everybody's wrong but them
[52:01] thank you jesus
[52:02] jeremiah chapter 17 verse 5 says thus
[52:06] said the lord cursed be the man that
[52:08] trusted in man and make it flat the
[52:10] flesh of
[52:11] uh make it flesh his arm and his heart
[52:14] departed from the lord right how
[52:17] beautifully jeremiah puts this right
[52:19] if a man
[52:21] if a believer of somebody that wants to
[52:24] serve god
[52:26] trust in the arm of flesh
[52:28] meaning follows
[52:30] a man he
[52:32] follows a man
[52:35] his heart departs from the lord
[52:39] look at that right hallelujah he's so
[52:42] dependent
[52:43] on this man on this great litter leader
[52:47] that his heart departs from god
[52:50] exactly hallelujah
[52:57] serpent said
[52:59] did you know barbara said this
[53:01] 1958
[53:03] he said you tabernacle here
[53:06] i told you we were going to change the
[53:08] name of this
[53:10] it's not right for it to be branham
[53:11] tabernacle
[53:13] that's just a man see
[53:16] we
[53:16] were going to change the name of it
[53:20] make it some other name
[53:22] yeah
[53:23] you said it
[53:24] yeah yeah right as far as i know it's
[53:26] still called branham tabernacle
[53:29] hallelujah
[53:31] he said we'll get on that after a while
[53:33] i just want it to be
[53:36] the church of the living god
[53:40] oh my amen i don't want it methodist
[53:42] baptist presbyterian pentecostal
[53:45] brandon mike right yeah i mean
[53:48] i just added that right right
[53:50] not say that right but it did say you
[53:53] wanted to change the name of the church
[53:56] hallelujah
[53:57] because we are not to build a tabernacle
[54:00] for moses or elijah or some great man
[54:04] hallelujah if we are to build a church
[54:06] it's not to be supposed to be built
[54:08] around certain personalities
[54:11] but it should be built up around jesus
[54:14] christ and jesus christ is the word amen
[54:16] amen he is the true head of the true
[54:19] church of the living god that's right
[54:21] amen hallelujah
[54:26] of the spirit this is very strong quote
[54:29] 1956. he said do you believe you can do
[54:32] that today
[54:34] you can make an idol out of your church
[54:38] you can make an idol out of your pastor
[54:43] you can make an idol out of an
[54:45] evangelist
[54:47] and i'm afraid that that's what a whole
[54:49] lot of it is being done yeah amen
[54:52] but about them saw it in this day right
[54:54] right
[54:55] so a whole lot of this is happening
[54:57] right now right people are not following
[55:00] christ but they are following a man
[55:03] right
[55:04] that's right they're not
[55:06] this under subjection to the
[55:09] headship and leadership of the world
[55:12] but under the headship of man
[55:16] amen
[55:17] rejected king
[55:19] look how verbal
[55:20] said it
[55:22] speaking about saul
[55:25] he said now that's the kind of man that
[55:27] people like to choose today
[55:30] what kind what kind of what kind of a
[55:32] man the people does not seem to be
[55:35] satisfied with the way that god placed
[55:38] his church to be governed and controlled
[55:41] by the holy spirit
[55:43] right
[55:44] they want somebody
[55:46] some man some denomination
[55:50] certain people to govern the church
[55:53] and that they are not able to throw
[55:55] themselves completely into god's hand
[55:58] and to be spiritually led by the holy
[56:01] spirit
[56:03] they want somebody to do their religion
[56:06] for them
[56:07] that's right exactly
[56:09] they want the pastor to
[56:12] to tell the sisters just how to wear
[56:15] their dresses yeah yeah
[56:17] hallelujah
[56:20] and
[56:21] how to lead their families
[56:26] and and
[56:27] there are more and more message churches
[56:30] message churches in our country that are
[56:32] leading this way yeah
[56:35] they're teaching a very strong headship
[56:38] yeah
[56:39] hallelujah right so that whatever the
[56:42] pastor says
[56:44] it's like um
[56:46] it's like the word of god yeah right
[56:49] the pastor's word is infallible
[56:52] hallelujah
[56:54] they're saying now that
[56:57] christ
[56:58] and the church types the pastor
[57:01] and the local congregation
[57:03] the pastor
[57:04] is the husband of the local congregation
[57:08] and as christ is the giver of the sid
[57:11] and the church is only the receiver
[57:14] it's just on the receiving
[57:16] part
[57:17] and and and the church has no
[57:20] right to question whatever the lord
[57:22] teaches oh yeah
[57:24] and and then they they parallel that to
[57:27] the relationship between the pastor and
[57:29] the congregation the congregation is not
[57:32] supposed to question the pastor they say
[57:35] hallelujah
[57:37] but
[57:41] you'd wonder because
[57:44] a lot of people
[57:46] are more inclined
[57:49] to
[57:50] to uh to be under subjection to the
[57:53] pastor oh yeah yeah done to the word of
[57:55] god right
[57:57] sure hallelujah
[57:58] this is better what
[58:00] exactly is saying
[58:02] hallelujah that
[58:03] the people cannot be satisfied with the
[58:05] way
[58:06] with the way god meant for the holy
[58:09] spirit to be the leader of the church
[58:13] there's a reason why that had to be
[58:17] his last sermon
[58:19] right hallelujah
[58:21] leadership was his last sermon
[58:25] before he he preached a message on
[58:27] communion yeah
[58:29] hallelujah and in that in that sermon he
[58:32] pointed us to our
[58:34] true leader he did not point us to some
[58:37] of his trainees
[58:42] to some of his hunting buddies
[58:44] hallelujah giving that point to some
[58:47] great man
[59:01] truly they will not point
[59:17] it away the lamb of god who take it away
[59:19] the sin of the world amen right amen
[59:22] amen hallelujah that's what a true
[59:23] leader will do right amen amen
[59:28] amen
[59:30] they want somebody to do their religion
[59:32] for them somebody that will tell them
[59:34] just how to do it and all about it yeah
[59:37] right so this man seemed to be to suit
[59:40] the place exactly so right because he
[59:43] was a very intellectual man
[59:46] and then he said it's a whole lot like
[59:48] today
[59:50] we like to choose such people too
[59:53] to control our churches
[59:55] to control the church of god
[59:57] nothing that i have to say against it
[59:59] but just merely to make a point
[1:00:02] that it is not
[1:00:04] and it was not
[1:00:05] and it will never be the will of god for
[1:00:08] such to be right
[1:00:10] god is to rule his people and to govern
[1:00:15] each individual right right right how
[1:00:18] many times
[1:00:19] did we hear where did him say
[1:00:21] when he deals with israel he deals with
[1:00:24] them as a nation as a group
[1:00:28] when when he deals with a
[1:00:29] gentile church he deals with a gentile
[1:00:32] church as individuals right amen that's
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] amen hallelujah you won't make it to the
[1:00:38] rapture just because you come to church
[1:00:39] here
[1:00:52] very obedient to the leadership of this
[1:00:54] church your pastor your deacons
[1:00:56] hallelujah
[1:00:59] assure you of being in the rapture
[1:01:01] that's right brother amen
[1:01:03] said this is not a group revelation
[1:01:06] that's right
[1:01:07] it's not even a family
[1:01:15] the bible says two will be in the bed
[1:01:17] and what will be taken and right
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] that's true hallelujah
[1:01:23] god is to rule his people
[1:01:26] and to govern each individual right
[1:01:29] amen right you look at saying
[1:01:32] saint john in in the book of revelation
[1:01:35] john types the bride all right
[1:01:38] but
[1:01:39] look at him he took the book the open
[1:01:41] book
[1:01:43] after the seals have been opened
[1:01:45] he took the book from the hand of him
[1:01:47] that holds it right
[1:01:50] from the hand of the mighty angel of
[1:01:52] revelation
[1:01:54] yes not from the hand of revelation
[1:01:59] but from the hand of the mighty angel
[1:02:01] think about that
[1:02:03] lord
[1:02:04] hallelujah we're thankful that brother
[1:02:06] ben was used to the lord mightily amen
[1:02:09] amen to get our attention right and to
[1:02:12] bring to us a wonderful message
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:16] but we cannot get the revelation of this
[1:02:19] message from brother brother right right
[1:02:20] exactly
[1:02:22] only god can impart it to you all right
[1:02:24] amen that's right amen hallelujah all

[1:02:39] love the way
[1:02:40] brother dale delivers uh his sermons
[1:02:43] but as good as a preacher but the daily
[1:02:45] is he cannot impart the revelation to
[1:02:48] you
[1:02:49] you can only preach the word hallelujah
[1:02:52] and it's up to god to give you a
[1:02:53] revelation
[1:02:54] amen don't look to any man right
[1:02:57] regardless hallelujah look to god for
[1:03:00] revelation all right
[1:03:02] hallelujah amen

[1:03:05] said you think you understand this
[1:03:07] message
[1:03:08] well that just shows that you can read
[1:03:10] right okay
[1:03:12] that's right
[1:03:13] it has to be a revelation
[1:03:24] no it's not just a confession
[1:03:27] hallelujah
[1:03:28] the way i illustrate it back home is
[1:03:31] like this
[1:03:33] like uh
[1:03:35] a man who can walk the wires you know
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:40] right right two buildings
[1:03:42] and he walks it and he has
[1:03:45] many fans knowing that he's good at it
[1:03:48] and he tells the people do you believe
[1:03:50] that i can do this
[1:03:52] yeah walk on the rope
[1:03:54] yeah are we just this thick in my hand
[1:03:57] and they all say yes we believe you
[1:04:00] and he does it he walks on the road
[1:04:02] right yeah
[1:04:03] and then he asked them again now do you
[1:04:06] believe that i can do it with somebody
[1:04:09] sitting on my shoulder
[1:04:11] oh come on bro and they all say yes we
[1:04:13] believe you're good we believe in you
[1:04:17] and the next question was well let me
[1:04:20] have a volunteer
[1:04:24] yeah nobody wants to volunteer
[1:04:28] they say they believe him
[1:04:30] they say they can actually do it
[1:04:32] but when it comes to laying their life
[1:04:34] on the line
[1:04:35] nobody wants to do it
[1:04:40] revelation is if you really believe it
[1:04:43] yeah right right you can hang your life
[1:04:45] on yours
[1:04:50] that's right
[1:04:55] let this serve as a warning
[1:04:58] in joshua chapter 6 26 after the walls
[1:05:02] of jericho
[1:05:04] came crumbling down
[1:05:07] jericho was a city that stands
[1:05:11] uh between
[1:05:13] um
[1:05:14] the people of israel and the promised
[1:05:16] land
[1:05:18] and god had to
[1:05:21] destroy that wall right yeah to the
[1:05:23] ground amen hallelujah and
[1:05:26] jericho is a type of denomination right
[1:05:30] because denomination is putting up walls
[1:05:32] right right burban said it's a carnal
[1:05:35] system that separates brotherhood
[1:05:39] you find it even in the message right
[1:05:42] people believing this claiming to
[1:05:44] believe the same thing but would not
[1:05:46] come together to fellowship
[1:05:55] and joshua adjured them and at that time
[1:05:58] saying cursed be the man before the lord
[1:06:01] that rise it up and build this city
[1:06:04] jericho he shall lay the foundation
[1:06:06] thereof in his firstborn and his
[1:06:08] youngest son shall be set up shall he
[1:06:11] shall set up shall he set up the gates
[1:06:13] of it
[1:06:15] you see god so hates
[1:06:18] this spirit of denomination come on
[1:06:21] right and he shows us
[1:06:24] in types in shadow how much god hated it
[1:06:27] yeah right he said now i have destroyed
[1:06:31] this wall of the city right yeah curse
[1:06:34] be the man before the lord that tries to
[1:06:37] build it up again right oh yeah amen
[1:06:40] right hallelujah we have been set free
[1:06:43] by the message of the hour
[1:06:46] that's right the denominational wars
[1:06:48] have been destroyed amen right that's
[1:06:50] right that's why we can feel it coming
[1:06:52] fellowship with one another
[1:06:55] hallelujah oh what a glorious thing
[1:06:58] to be set free hallelujah by the word of
[1:07:01] god hallelujah
[1:07:02] to be set free from denominational
[1:07:04] abundance right
[1:07:06] but god so hates this spirit
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:12] joshua curse joshua is the holy spirit
[1:07:15] today right
[1:07:17] curse
[1:07:18] the man that will try to build it up
[1:07:20] again
[1:07:22] but guess what in first kings chapter 16
[1:07:25] verse 33 and 34 first kings 16
[1:07:30] 33 and 34
[1:07:32] this is what the bible says and ahab
[1:07:34] made a growth
[1:07:35] growth and ahab did more to promote the
[1:07:39] lord god of israel to anger than all the
[1:07:42] kings of israel that were before him all
[1:07:44] right
[1:07:45] in his days did hayel the battlelight
[1:07:48] build jericho
[1:07:51] after joshua forewarned him
[1:07:55] after joshua pronounced the curse to
[1:07:58] anybody that would try to build jericho
[1:08:01] up again and here's higher the better
[1:08:03] life building jericho he lay the
[1:08:06] foundation thereof in abuyon his first
[1:08:09] son
[1:08:10] and set up the gates thereof in his
[1:08:12] youngest son
[1:08:15] according to the word of the lord which
[1:08:17] is paid by joshua the son of none right
[1:08:22] how sad
[1:08:24] how sad all right
[1:08:27] and i believe we should be on the
[1:08:28] lookout
[1:08:30] glory hallelujah
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:33] in what we call the message movement the
[1:08:35] message screw
[1:08:37] because somebody
[1:08:38] will try to raise up the walls of
[1:08:40] jericho again
[1:08:42] right
[1:08:43] hallelujah
[1:08:46] yep
[1:08:47] i feel sorry for that man that's yeah
[1:08:49] that's
[1:08:50] right hallelujah
[1:08:54] so
[1:08:56] going back to david telling nathan
[1:08:58] i will build you a house i will
[1:09:01] tell tell tell god i will build him a
[1:09:04] house
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:09] well
[1:09:11] uh in isaiah chapter 9 verse 7 it says
[1:09:13] here of the increase of his government
[1:09:16] and peace there shall be no end upon the
[1:09:19] throne of david and upon his kingdom to
[1:09:21] order it and to establish it with
[1:09:23] judgment and with justice from
[1:09:25] henceforth even forever
[1:09:27] hallelujah i tried
[1:09:30] i believe god was speaking about another
[1:09:32] kingdom
[1:09:34] not the literal kingdom of david when he
[1:09:36] was here on earth
[1:09:38] hallelujah
[1:09:39] right god was referring to
[1:09:42] the kingdom of jesus christ the son of
[1:09:44] david amen amen god was referring to the
[1:09:47] church of the living god amen amen
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:52] first chronicles chapter 17 verse four
[1:09:54] let let's just read it
[1:09:56] one thing long
[1:09:58] verse 4
[1:10:00] chapter 17 verse 4
[1:10:04] and so nathan talked to god
[1:10:06] and here's what god had to say to nathan
[1:10:10] go and tell david my servant thus said
[1:10:14] the lord thou shalt not build me a house
[1:10:19] for i have not dwelt in a house since
[1:10:21] the day that i brought up israel unto
[1:10:24] this day
[1:10:25] but have gone from 10th to 10th and from
[1:10:27] one tabernacle to another
[1:10:30] wheresoever i have walked with all
[1:10:32] israel and speak i award to any of the
[1:10:35] judges of israel whom i command you to
[1:10:37] feed my people saying why have he not
[1:10:39] built me a house of cedars
[1:10:42] now therefore thus shalt thou say unto
[1:10:45] my servant david
[1:10:47] thus said the lord of hosts i took thee
[1:10:50] from the ship code
[1:10:52] even from following the ship
[1:10:54] hallelujah god was telling david now now
[1:10:58] david you're feeling sorry for me and
[1:11:00] you think you can help me you can do
[1:11:03] something for me
[1:11:04] you forgot where you come from
[1:11:07] hallelujah you said i took you from
[1:11:10] following the ship
[1:11:12] david was not even leading them he was
[1:11:14] following the ship
[1:11:16] that thou should be the ruler over my
[1:11:19] people israel and i have given i have
[1:11:23] been with thee whatsoever thou has
[1:11:25] walked and have cut off all thine
[1:11:28] enemies from the 40 and have made it a
[1:11:30] name like the name of the great men that
[1:11:33] are in the earth right right hallelujah
[1:11:36] david don't forget how i blessed you
[1:11:41] from zero you became a hero
[1:11:45] hallelujah
[1:11:46] first
[1:11:47] chronicles chapter 17 i'm just
[1:11:49] continuing continuing to read verse 10
[1:11:52] and since the time that i commanded
[1:11:55] judges to be over my people israel
[1:11:57] moreover i will subdue all the enemies
[1:12:00] furthermore i tell thee that the lord
[1:12:03] will build me a house
[1:12:06] no david
[1:12:08] you can't build me a house
[1:12:11] what house will you build me that's
[1:12:13] right the heaven is my throne
[1:12:15] and the earth is my footstool right
[1:12:17] hallelujah don't you know david that the
[1:12:20] living god dwelleth not in temples made
[1:12:23] with hands
[1:12:26] this temple here
[1:12:29] think about it it's not the dwelling
[1:12:31] place of god god can grow in this temple
[1:12:33] right exactly the church is not a place
[1:12:36] where we go to come on
[1:12:39] amen we are the church
[1:12:42] we are the temple right we are the
[1:12:44] tabernacle of the living god hallelujah
[1:12:46] amen amen
[1:12:51] listen
[1:12:56] so did you don't build me a house i
[1:12:58] built your house
[1:13:01] exactly what house was was god talking
[1:13:05] about all right it is the church of the
[1:13:06] living god amen that's right hallelujah
[1:13:10] because david kingdom
[1:13:12] david's kingdom ended a long time ago
[1:13:14] right right
[1:13:16] but the church of the living god is here
[1:13:19] and will remain forever and ever
[1:13:23] glory hallelujah
[1:13:27] in hebrews chapter 10 verse 5
[1:13:30] wherefore when he commented to the world
[1:13:32] he said sacrifice and offering thou
[1:13:34] would is not but a body
[1:13:37] right hast thou prepared for man
[1:13:40] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
[1:13:42] thou has no pleasure
[1:13:44] then said i lo i come in the volume of
[1:13:47] the book it's when it's written on me to
[1:13:49] do thy will of god amen
[1:13:52] and i believe this is the very essence
[1:13:54] of church
[1:13:56] yes the kingdom of god hallelujah
[1:13:58] kingdom
[1:14:00] has three elements
[1:14:02] the ruler
[1:14:03] the subjects and the actual exercise of
[1:14:06] rulership right
[1:14:08] hallelujah
[1:14:10] and the holy spirit is our king right
[1:14:16] and there's an actual exercise
[1:14:20] the subjects are
[1:14:21] under submission right to the handshape
[1:14:24] hallelujah of this king
[1:14:31] a house is actually a king kingdom yeah
[1:14:34] right a house is a kingdom in old
[1:14:36] english
[1:14:37] hallelujah and the church of the living
[1:14:39] god is a kingdom
[1:14:40] we can say christ is rain
[1:14:43] right right right now reigning upon his
[1:14:46] subjects
[1:14:48] hallelujah and one of them said the
[1:14:50] church can only know his his position
[1:14:53] right
[1:14:54] now hey you know
[1:14:55] when we quote that statement
[1:14:57] the believers they actually think you
[1:14:59] know
[1:15:00] a
[1:15:01] ranking
[1:15:04] a place in the hierarchy
[1:15:08] position of greatness
[1:15:11] it's actually a position of submission
[1:15:15] hallelujah because the body is always
[1:15:17] subject to the head right all right yeah
[1:15:20] amen
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:25] and i conduct a
[1:15:27] like a couple session in my church
[1:15:30] and we read the book of efficient where
[1:15:32] it says
[1:15:34] wives submit to your husband in
[1:15:36] everything right
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:39] and some of the sisters will
[1:15:43] come up to me and say
[1:15:44] brother does it really mean everything
[1:15:49] yeah
[1:15:50] right what if they're wrong
[1:15:54] are we obligated to submit to something
[1:15:55] that is wrong
[1:15:57] hallelujah yeah i just tell them sister
[1:16:01] the lord did not
[1:16:03] appoint you
[1:16:05] as a uh
[1:16:08] as a evaluator
[1:16:10] right you're not supposed to evaluate
[1:16:12] whether your husband is right or wrong
[1:16:14] right now your place is to submit right
[1:16:31] well there's a difference between
[1:16:33] submission yeah and agreement yeah yeah
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:38] right submission is not agreement right
[1:16:41] right right
[1:16:42] hallelujah

[1:16:54] to go with me to the mall
[1:16:56] we'll eat in a

[1:17:22] how many times when you first read the
[1:17:24] bible how many times did you find things
[1:17:26] there yeah hallelujah that was contrary
[1:17:29] to our upbringing our culture our
[1:17:32] education
[1:17:33] hallelujah didn't agree with everything
[1:17:35] that we believe right nevertheless it
[1:17:37] was still the word of god right right
[1:17:40] well he first came into the message
[1:17:44] many times have we read batman making
[1:17:45] statements right but we didn't didn't
[1:17:48] believe us right that wasn't exactly
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:53] all right hallelujah but we are not to
[1:17:55] be evolvators
[1:17:58] we're not to be assessors right
[1:18:00] hallelujah our position
[1:18:03] is to submit right yeah
[1:18:05] that's right man exactly whether you can
[1:18:07] believe it or not you submit
[1:18:10] whether you think it's right or not you
[1:18:12] submit right thank you

[1:18:19] how many people think to submit
[1:18:22] is to show weakness
[1:18:23] yeah
[1:18:24] hallelujah but naturally inequality
[1:18:27] submission is power glory
[1:18:32] when christ submitted to the will of the
[1:18:34] father he said i can do nothing except
[1:18:36] the father shows me
[1:18:39] that's why he bypassed all the sick
[1:18:40] people in that pool right and came to
[1:18:42] this uh uh uh
[1:18:44] uh a paralytic man who was not even
[1:18:47] uh in danger of dying
[1:18:50] because that was where that was to whom
[1:18:53] the father led him right man

[1:18:57] and afterwards he said
[1:18:59] all power both
[1:19:00] in heaven and on earth he is now
[1:19:02] delivered unto me amen why because he
[1:19:06] prayed not my will but your will be done
[1:19:08] right he was completely subverted to the
[1:19:11] will of the father
[1:19:14] hallelujah look at god
[1:19:16] he did not claim to do
[1:19:19] those miracles on his own
[1:19:34] unless he shows me i can do nothing

[1:19:38] know in that movie

[1:19:49] right
[1:19:51] and then after he said he's here he said
[1:19:53] i take every spirit in this building
[1:19:55] under my control right right in the name
[1:19:57] of jesus christ
[1:20:00] you see submission

[1:23:08] no wonder when jesus prayed in john
[1:23:11] chapter 12 verse 26

[1:26:20] to cause a person's dignity and work to
[1:26:22] be manifested and acknowledged
[1:26:26] hallelujah
[1:26:29] rising on the sun we are familiar with
[1:26:30] this quotation and if he being the groom
[1:26:34] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:26:37] part of him
[1:26:38] it can only be the manifestation and the
[1:26:40] fulfilling
[1:26:42] of all revelations and the others that
[1:26:44] spoke of the bride and it can only
[1:26:47] manifest and if it does something
[1:26:49] different from the groom are you
[1:26:50] listening
[1:26:52] if the bride does something different
[1:26:54] from the groom then it isn't the bride
[1:26:57] right because she is flesh of his flesh

[1:27:44] here's another
[1:27:45] it'll blow your mind it's another
[1:27:46] quotation
[1:27:48] questions and answers
[1:27:50] 1964 when jesus suffered in that body
[1:27:54] because a man and a woman are one person
[1:27:59] he was taken out of adam and the church
[1:28:02] what happened god opened up the side of
[1:28:04] adam and took out their help mate
[1:28:07] the bride and god opened up the sight of
[1:28:10] jesus at calvary and took out the bride
[1:28:16] how could jesus
[1:28:18] give his glory to the bride rabbit eight
[1:28:22] years ago
[1:28:23] because jesus and the bride are one
[1:28:26] person
[1:28:32] do you realize that when you receive a
[1:28:34] revelation of this message you actually

[1:29:14] that word when we are part of it all
[1:29:16] right
[1:29:18] your theophany mighty opening believers
[1:29:22] still believe together
[1:29:28] said something about the little leak of
[1:29:30] fire right
[1:29:32] it was the same little lick of fire uh
[1:29:34] on the day of pentacles
[1:29:36] you know at first they saw a big ball of
[1:29:38] fire
[1:29:39] and the next thing that happened that
[1:29:40] big
[1:29:41] ball of fire separated right itself
[1:29:44] amongst the believers 120 of them it
[1:29:47] became 120 licks of fire right
[1:29:58] and others licks of other believers
[1:30:00] licks of fire put together makes up the
[1:30:03] pillar of fire
