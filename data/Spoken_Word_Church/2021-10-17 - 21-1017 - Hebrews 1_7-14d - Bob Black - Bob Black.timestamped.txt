[0:00] we're going to keep going through the
[0:02] book of hebrews here if the brothers
[0:03] could go ahead and pull that up
[0:08] and uh
[0:10] i was i was listening to sirs uh
[0:13] uh would you see jesus um
[0:17] sir sir we would see jesus and brother
[0:19] brown was talking about how if the
[0:20] brothers should go ahead and pull that
[0:21] slide up how the bible is kind of
[0:23] written in uh
[0:25] in a way that if we we read the
[0:27] the way that it's written now and the
[0:28] kind of that king's english that's kind
[0:30] of difficult to read
[0:32] and difficult to understand almost but
[0:33] he said in the in in that sermon he was
[0:36] breaking down about how that the way it
[0:38] was originally written was was like
[0:40] street language
[0:41] it's supposed to be real
[0:43] real simple for us to understand and um
[0:46] maybe um
[0:48] maybe this morning we can make things a
[0:49] little bit simpler
[0:51] before we get into this let's just let's
[0:52] just pray real quick well god we just
[0:55] asked lord that you'll just open up the
[0:56] word lord as we as we kind of study some
[0:58] some deeper things out this morning lord
[1:00] did you just be with us and be with
[1:01] brother wade that back there studying
[1:03] and just bless him and help him lord and
[1:04] give him strength we pray in the name of
[1:06] the lord jesus christ amen
[1:10] so um we got down to around about uh
[1:14] we we read the last time we we got
[1:16] through down to about verse 12 i think
[1:18] so we're on verse 13 which is a little
[1:20] bit weighty so let's just kind of catch
[1:22] up a little bit to set the context of
[1:23] where we were
[1:25] in verse 7 says
[1:27] and of the angels he saith who maketh
[1:29] his angels spirits and his ministers of
[1:30] flame of fire but unto the son he saith
[1:33] thy throne o god is forever and ever a
[1:35] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[1:37] of thy kingdom
[1:39] thou hast loved righteousness and hated
[1:41] iniquity therefore god even thy god hath
[1:43] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[1:45] above thy fellas
[1:47] and you'll remember the last time just
[1:48] to kind of recap a little bit we we kind
[1:50] of recapped how the angels uh how paul
[1:53] was kind of bringing that down to
[1:55] the
[1:56] ministering spirits minister sent to
[1:58] bring the word to the people but but god
[2:01] under the sun he saith thy throne
[2:04] so the son has got a throne
[2:06] and his scepter is righteousness and
[2:08] because he loved righteousness and hated
[2:10] iniquity he he's been anointed with the
[2:13] oil of gladness above his fellows and we
[2:15] kind of dove into the difference between
[2:16] righteousness and iniquity a little bit
[2:18] and compare those two
[2:20] and if you kind of you know i like to
[2:21] just kind of run things down through the
[2:23] scriptures if you kind of get in your
[2:24] mind what what iniquity is and and how
[2:28] iniquity is that crookedness getting off
[2:30] the word
[2:31] something something down if you if you
[2:33] can get in your mind what the iniquity
[2:34] is and then how to get rid of iniquity
[2:36] the righteousness of the word is what
[2:38] will get rid of iniquity and bring that
[2:40] all over into the first seal where
[2:42] brother brandon began to talk about how
[2:43] the mixture of iniquity already works
[2:45] and what iniquity is and think about
[2:48] as you begin to just get to go back and
[2:50] study the scripture because we are
[2:51] studying church we we rock we like to
[2:54] study so when you study study things out
[2:56] think think about that maybe when you go
[2:58] back and listen to the to the first seal
[3:00] again think about what it takes to get
[3:02] rid of iniquity and what brother brown
[3:03] is really speaking of there
[3:06] and in verse 10
[3:07] and thou lord in the beginning has laid
[3:09] the foundation of the earth and the
[3:10] heavens are the works of thine hands
[3:12] thou they shall perish
[3:14] but thou remainest and they shall all
[3:17] wax old as death of garment and as a
[3:19] vesture shall thou fold them up and they
[3:22] shall be changed but thou art the same
[3:24] and thy years shall not fail
[3:26] and you can see as the earth changes and
[3:28] and people change and they get older and
[3:30] they get wrinkles and things but yet god
[3:31] remains the same and i think that's a
[3:33] confidence that we can have this morning
[3:35] that he's the same yesterday today and
[3:37] forever the same way that they
[3:39] approached him in the old testament we
[3:40] can approach him the same way and get
[3:42] the same results because he's the same
[3:44] god
[3:45] and he never changes
[3:47] and then
[3:48] here we are at the end of almost the end
[3:50] of hebrews 13 hebrews chapter 1 verses
[3:53] 13 and 14
[3:55] and verse 13 is really weighty so let's
[3:57] dive into that a little bit this morning
[3:59] it's it's kind of getting into some deep
[4:01] water
[4:02] and it says but to which of the angels
[4:04] said he at any time
[4:06] sit on my right hand until i make thine
[4:08] enemies that footstool and this is
[4:10] something that david quoted in psalms
[4:12] 110 psalms chapter 110 and again that
[4:15] peter quoted on the day of pentecost
[4:17] why would they why would peter quote
[4:20] this scripture on the day of pentecost
[4:22] to which of the angels said he at any
[4:24] time
[4:25] sit on my right hand until i make down
[4:27] enemies that footstool so
[4:30] paul's
[4:31] he's conveying a lot of imagery in here
[4:33] somebody's god is sitting down somewhere
[4:35] and he's got a footstool and he's here
[4:38] you know he's uh he's he's at a place
[4:41] where he can sit
[4:43] somewhere
[4:44] until something happens
[4:46] and so let's dive into that let's go to
[4:48] the next slide
[4:50] now now this kind of echoes
[4:52] hebrews at the beginning of this chapter
[4:54] paul said who bring the brightness of
[4:57] his glory and the express image of his
[4:59] person and upholding all things by the
[5:01] word of his power when he had by himself
[5:02] purged our sins
[5:04] sat down on the right hand of the
[5:06] majesty on high so he sat down somewhere
[5:09] so the question this morning is where
[5:11] did he see it
[5:12] where did he sit because if you can find
[5:13] where he's set then you can begin to
[5:16] you can begin to see the pattern
[5:18] of what's happened what's taking place
[5:20] in daniel 70 weeks
[5:22] and the seals
[5:24] and what brother rounds really talking
[5:26] about in the seals and things begin to
[5:28] open up if you can kind of begin to get
[5:30] to get the picture
[5:31] of where did he see it where did he sit
[5:34] what does the right hand of his power
[5:35] mean what does it mean to to have a
[5:38] footstool until all of his enemies are
[5:39] conquered what does that mean all the
[5:41] enemies all all of the all until every
[5:43] enemy
[5:45] so let's go to the next strong the next
[5:47] uh the next slide
[5:52] questions and answers law having a
[5:53] shadow brother ram said
[5:55] and i'm just going to read read you what
[5:56] brother brown said about it he said what
[5:58] did the prophets all say jesus would do
[6:00] when he come
[6:02] rule the nations with a rod of iron is
[6:04] that right they failed to see his first
[6:06] coming to the gentile so all the
[6:08] prophets said he was going to come to
[6:10] rule the nations with a rod about in
[6:11] other words sit on the throne and that's
[6:13] what the jews were looking for that when
[6:15] he would come he would see he would sit
[6:16] on his throne and rule the king he would
[6:18] have a kingdom
[6:19] and and so they were looking for it but
[6:20] then there's there's something has has
[6:22] to take place in between that in between
[6:24] him actually sitting on his millennial
[6:26] throne and ruling over the earth and
[6:29] and and so forth there's got there's got
[6:31] to be something else take place in
[6:32] between there and that's what the jews
[6:34] missed when they were looking for is
[6:36] looking for is coming he said they
[6:37] failed to see his first coming to the
[6:39] gentiles
[6:40] when he returns then he does rule all
[6:43] nations he will come he isn't up on his
[6:45] now here's the key he isn't up on his
[6:47] throne now
[6:48] he's sitting on god's throne so that's
[6:51] where he's sitting he's sitting on god's
[6:52] throne now if we can find out where
[6:54] god's throne is then we're getting
[6:56] somewhere
[6:57] so he's not sitting on his throne yet
[6:59] what was his throne his throne is going
[7:01] to be his throne his work where he
[7:03] actually comes back in his flesh and
[7:05] sits in the millennial kingdom and he
[7:07] reigns
[7:08] for a thousand years and he's actually
[7:09] there back in his body again sitting on
[7:12] his throne back it back raining again
[7:15] but for now he's setting on god's throne
[7:19] he that overcomes and brother ram quotes
[7:21] the scripture he that overcomes shall
[7:22] sit with me on my throne as i have
[7:24] overcome and set on my father's strong
[7:27] now he's wanting to come back and and
[7:29] who where is his earthly throne he says
[7:31] the throne of david
[7:33] god said he'd give him the throne of
[7:35] david in the millennium he'll sit on
[7:37] david's throne and we'll see him the
[7:39] great king of kings sitting there we'll
[7:41] see him we'll be able to look with our
[7:42] eyes and see him actually sitting there
[7:44] on his throne
[7:46] now
[7:47] he's sitting on his father's strong
[7:49] in other words he's sitting in god's
[7:51] power in spirit now but when he comes
[7:54] back
[7:55] he'll set an earthly body on david's
[7:57] throne
[7:58] now he's sitting in the majesty of
[8:01] father now when we say father it's jesus
[8:03] it's the spirit of god
[8:05] by the holy spirit
[8:07] in us
[8:08] now he's on his father's throne
[8:11] right hand of majesty
[8:13] i love the wording that paul uses the in
[8:15] the right hand of power and authority
[8:17] because that means wherever he's sitting
[8:19] he's not sitting there just to play
[8:20] around or just to just just to play a
[8:23] game or something but he's actually
[8:25] seated in power and authority
[8:27] wherever he's seated
[8:30] now now to really understand where he's
[8:32] seated you got to go back to the old
[8:34] testament types and kind of it kind of
[8:36] paints a picture in your mind so let's
[8:37] go to the next slide now in the old
[8:38] testament there was a seat
[8:40] and it was in the middle of that
[8:41] three-room house and i think we all know
[8:44] we've been taught well enough that we
[8:45] know where that three-room house was and
[8:47] we know the journey that you go through
[8:49] that three-room house justification
[8:50] sanctification the baptism in the holy
[8:52] ghost
[8:53] the light is uh
[8:55] you know as you go through the the the
[8:57] light on the outer corner it you know
[8:59] that they can be covered by the clouds
[9:01] and so forth and do all the types you
[9:02] get into the into the holy place and
[9:04] you've got the candlesticks they have to
[9:05] be kept
[9:06] lit and burning but once you get in the
[9:08] inside
[9:09] there's a kind of glory lights up that
[9:11] place all the time it's always lit and
[9:14] so in that place is a mercy seat it's a
[9:17] seat and it's kind of a
[9:18] think of us you wouldn't think of a seat
[9:20] as looking like this normally a seat
[9:23] would have a cushion maybe some armrests
[9:25] a place for actual body to sit down but
[9:28] this is not a place like a seat like
[9:30] that this is a
[9:31] a seat for deity a seat for deity to
[9:34] come actually and dwell in that place
[9:36] and there were requirements for the
[9:38] deity to be for god to come and be able
[9:40] to come and dwell in that place first
[9:41] there had to be blood sprinkling them on
[9:43] the mercy seat there had to be an
[9:45] atonement made there had to be
[9:47] you had to get the word uh packed in
[9:49] there you had to get um
[9:50] all the the process of going in there
[9:53] that the the priest had to go through
[9:54] all the all the rights and everything to
[9:56] be able to get in there
[9:58] but once you got in there once once the
[10:00] deed once all the requirements were met
[10:02] the deity god will say
[10:04] i'm saying the deity the deity we're
[10:06] talking about is god
[10:08] god would come and sit down on that seat
[10:12] but it's typing something it's typing
[10:14] something that would take place in the
[10:15] new testament
[10:16] that god can actually come down and sit
[10:18] himself in the bride
[10:21] and in psalm 99 1 i got the scripture
[10:23] written here it says the lord reigneth
[10:25] let the people trembleth he sitteth
[10:26] between the cherubims he actually sat on
[10:28] between the cherubims on that mercy seat
[10:31] that's where god set in the old
[10:32] testament as a type
[10:34] that one day he wouldn't be sitting
[10:35] between the cherubims anymore like that
[10:38] but he would be sitting
[10:39] in your in your tabernacle
[10:42] he sitteth between the cherubims and let
[10:44] the earth be moved so he sat in the
[10:46] center of that in the type of the center
[10:48] of the three-room house
[10:51] now brother brown in in in the next
[10:53] slide in 1961 he said now now
[10:56] the mercy seat
[10:58] now the mercy seats where's the mercy
[11:00] seat at in the heart
[11:02] see where the shining forth of his glory
[11:05] and all of his children the shekinah
[11:06] glory and the human heart
[11:08] here is the human heart
[11:10] the center of that three-room house is
[11:12] that right is that the mercy seat
[11:15] how do you come through it into that
[11:16] through these different systems through
[11:18] self-will comes into here and through
[11:20] here comes out what shekinah glory
[11:23] what is the shekinah glory is god's
[11:25] presence
[11:26] and when a man's walking or a woman he's
[11:29] reflecting the shekinah glory he don't
[11:31] go in the damn gambling dens and carry
[11:33] on and go out here and deny the word
[11:35] no matter what the people says
[11:37] he's got his heart set on one thing god
[11:43] and there's a there's a good evidence of
[11:45] whether or not god is sitting
[11:47] on the throne of your heart is whether
[11:49] you actually care about the things of
[11:51] god or not because once he's once did he
[11:54] has set down
[11:55] on that seat
[11:57] then it's going to change everything
[11:59] now you can see over i got some little
[12:01] diagrams that i pulled off the internet
[12:02] of of what the mercy seat looked like
[12:04] and what the tabernacle looked like and
[12:06] those are all kind of things to ponder
[12:08] and dwell on about what what what that
[12:10] means that that you need to think about
[12:12] the tabernacle
[12:13] is just a symbol of you
[12:15] and the mercy seat
[12:17] is a symbol of god coming down and
[12:19] dwelling in your heart
[12:22] excuse me
[12:25] now let's go to the next night sliding
[12:26] up now now brother ram said and just
[12:28] keeping on that on that thought he said
[12:30] now you say i got to in revelation
[12:32] chapter 4 number two he said i got to
[12:34] all right i can tell i can tell dirty
[12:36] jokes that don't condemn me why you
[12:38] ain't got nothing they can condemn no
[12:39] one's there to take it out no one's
[12:41] there to condemn you
[12:42] in other words before the holy ghost
[12:44] there's nobody seated in there that that
[12:46] god is not seated on your throne so
[12:49] nobody's there to condemn you but just
[12:51] skipping down he said there's nobody
[12:52] there's nothing there to judge you but
[12:54] when christ comes in
[12:56] what happened you created an altar
[12:59] on your heart
[13:00] and your sins are taken daily
[13:03] saint paul said i die daily nevertheless
[13:05] i live not me but christ liveth in me
[13:08] there's the inner veil what's the
[13:10] interval of god that god actually coming
[13:12] in
[13:13] into your heart past past that interval
[13:16] that was typed in the old testament
[13:17] testament
[13:18] to to to sit on your throne
[13:22] now let's go to uh the next slide and
[13:25] in acts chapter two now
[13:27] so so we know i mentioned earlier that
[13:30] paul peter actually quoted this
[13:32] scripture from psalms 110 on the day of
[13:34] pentecost
[13:36] and a lot of times we we uh we like to
[13:38] quote that he quoted joel you know this
[13:40] is that and he identified this now that
[13:42] that that joel said that he was poor
[13:44] spirit out on all flesh but we kind of
[13:47] skip over a lot of times that that peter
[13:49] quoted
[13:51] this scripture
[13:52] and and we'll read it here uh this jesus
[13:54] had god raised up wherever we all are
[13:56] witnesses therefore being by the right
[13:58] hand of god exalted and having received
[14:00] of the father the promise of the holy
[14:01] ghost
[14:02] he hath shed forth this which he now see
[14:04] and hear for david now here's the
[14:06] scripture that he's quoting david david
[14:08] is not ascended into the heavens but he
[14:10] saith himself
[14:12] the lord said unto my lord sit thou on
[14:15] my right hand until i make thy foes thy
[14:18] footstool
[14:20] now see we're just we're carrying on
[14:21] from what what paul is saying in hebrews
[14:23] 1 13
[14:25] that sit on my right hand until i make
[14:27] down enemies that footstool now they're
[14:29] both quoting from david they said in
[14:31] psalms and jesus quoted this to the
[14:33] pharisees when when he began to say now
[14:35] you say that that that the messiah is
[14:37] going to be the son of david but how how
[14:40] could he be the son of david and yet
[14:41] david calls in the lord when he says the
[14:43] lord said unto my lord sit down on my
[14:45] right hand
[14:46] now you see there's all sorts of things
[14:48] bottled up in this little scripture here
[14:49] the lord said on my
[14:51] the lord said unto my lord
[14:53] what's that talking about
[14:55] sit thou on my right hand
[14:57] sit down on my right hand that sounds
[14:59] like that sounds like multiple people
[15:02] until i make all your enemies by my my
[15:05] footstool
[15:06] until i make until until everything's
[15:09] been conquered so there's a lot there to
[15:11] unpack
[15:12] the lord said unto my lord who's that
[15:14] talking about
[15:16] sitting on my right hand
[15:18] so i think we've already kind of
[15:19] established where god is sitting
[15:21] so and he's not sitting he's not sitting
[15:23] just to play around but he's sitting in
[15:26] power and authority and he's sitting
[15:27] there to do something to conquer all the
[15:29] enemies until every enemy is under his
[15:32] feet until he's made his footstool
[15:34] so let's keep reading
[15:36] if the next slide brother brown said in
[15:38] christ 1955 he said and through the
[15:40] blood you become a part of him into the
[15:42] same into the same cell that he came out
[15:44] of
[15:46] and the very presence and part of god
[15:48] comes into you
[15:49] by faith you purchase it
[15:51] and that same holy spirit that was in
[15:53] the lord jesus christ comes into you
[15:56] and he said if we keep reading down
[15:58] think of it brother how that god in his
[16:00] infinite mercy purchasing us through the
[16:02] blood of jesus
[16:03] and now
[16:05] sitting at the right hand of the majesty
[16:07] right hand means in power and authority
[16:10] that as a high priest to make
[16:12] intercessions upon anything that we
[16:14] confess that he has done
[16:16] after once coming into the fellowship
[16:18] sign your name on the check say here it
[16:20] is
[16:21] there you get it we believe that we get
[16:23] what we asked for because we've judged
[16:25] god to keep his word
[16:27] so now now god he's
[16:29] he's painting the same picture that paul
[16:31] painted that god sets down at the right
[16:34] hand of the majesty he sets down in
[16:37] power and authority to actually fulfill
[16:39] god's word and he's sitting down on the
[16:41] throne of your heart so he's sitting
[16:44] down on the throne of your heart in
[16:45] power
[16:47] as a high priest so there again is that
[16:49] picture that paul is trying to paint
[16:50] that christ is our high priest
[16:53] and what does the high priest the high
[16:54] priest goes in with the offering
[16:56] and he's there to to to to do all the
[16:59] all the working of of atoning for your
[17:02] sins and doing all fulfilling all the
[17:04] rights and all so christ actually goes
[17:06] into your heart
[17:08] with us with to show that the blood has
[17:10] been offered to do the work and he's
[17:12] he's the one that we we can pray to with
[17:15] with the surety and and uh
[17:17] knowing that he's he's touched by the
[17:19] feeling of our infirmities and with all
[17:21] those confidence because he is our high
[17:23] priest that's entered in beyond the veil
[17:26] to to make intercessions upon anything
[17:29] that we confess that he has done
[17:31] now let's go to the next slide and just
[17:33] keep kind of laying this out
[17:36] now in hebrews chapter one when brother
[17:38] brandon preached this this message he
[17:39] said
[17:40] what does right hand mean not god has a
[17:43] right hand that somebody is sitting on
[17:45] it right hand means the power and
[17:48] authority got the authority over
[17:50] everything in heaven and earth
[17:52] and all the heavens and earth is made by
[17:55] him
[17:56] and in the eagle as the eagle stirred up
[17:58] her nest he said he's sitting at the
[18:00] right hand of god on god's throne
[18:04] that's not his throne
[18:06] he's coming back to reign on his throne
[18:08] it's the throne of david he's to take
[18:11] his throne
[18:12] he's sitting on god's throne waiting
[18:15] till the last enemy is made his
[18:18] footstool
[18:19] now let's let's recap a little bit
[18:21] because i know some some people got in a
[18:22] little bit late this morning
[18:24] so his throne
[18:26] is that throne that actual physical
[18:28] throne where you can look over there and
[18:30] see jesus sitting on his throne
[18:32] but in the meantime he sits on his
[18:34] father's throne
[18:36] and we've established that by reading
[18:37] several quotes and and going through the
[18:40] scripture and going through the message
[18:42] that the father strong is the throne of
[18:44] your heart
[18:45] and so he said it he sets himself on the
[18:47] father's throne
[18:49] and while he's working something out
[18:51] he's he's doing he's accomplishing his
[18:53] purpose to overcome
[18:54] every enemy and we'll see we'll see
[18:57] later that the all the enemies include
[19:00] sickness includes
[19:01] sin includes it include the final enemy
[19:04] brother brown said was death
[19:06] so he sets himself down on the father's
[19:09] throne until every enemy until until
[19:12] he's working he's working it out until
[19:14] every enemy including death is conquered
[19:17] and when death is conquered death is
[19:19] conquered in you like brother ram said
[19:21] that you can you'll come to a place
[19:23] where you can wipe death off your sleeve
[19:25] you'll you'll be changed and go in a
[19:28] rapture
[19:32] now
[19:33] let's go to the next slide
[19:36] so again just what we're talking about
[19:38] is hebrews 1 13 but to which of the
[19:41] angels said he at any time sit on my
[19:43] right hand until i make thine enemies
[19:45] that footstool
[19:46] and we're diving into that
[19:48] now in revelation 1 16 it says he had it
[19:50] in his right hand seven stars
[19:52] and and brother branham again in the in
[19:54] the ephesian church age really hones in
[19:57] on what the right hand means
[19:59] he said there he is with the seven stars
[20:01] in his right hand the right hand or arms
[20:04] signifies the power and authority of god
[20:07] in psalm 144 3 for they got not the land
[20:09] in possession by their own sword neither
[20:12] did their own arms save them but thy
[20:13] right hand and that arm
[20:16] in that right hand of power are seven
[20:18] stars who according to revelation 1 20
[20:20] are the seven church messengers and he
[20:22] said this signifies that the very power
[20:25] and authority of god are behind his
[20:27] messengers to every age they go forth in
[20:30] the fire and power of the holy ghost
[20:32] with the word how could they do that
[20:35] because deity is set down in the throne
[20:38] of their heart and because he sat down
[20:41] he sat down on the right hand of power
[20:43] and authority so they've got the holy
[20:45] ghost within them to preach the word in
[20:47] its entirety in his fullness and when
[20:49] god sets down on the heart of it
[20:55] when god sits down in your heart you can
[20:57] go with that same power and authority
[21:00] that god has set down in your heart
[21:04] let's go to the next slide
[21:06] and brother ram said uh uh well in
[21:09] revelation chapter 3 verse 21 it says to
[21:11] him that overcometh will i grant to sit
[21:13] with me in my throne now we know where
[21:16] his throne is now his throne is going to
[21:19] be a a an actual throne that you can
[21:21] look at that you can go up to him and
[21:24] talk to him that when we get to the
[21:26] the new jerusalem you'll be able to go
[21:28] up to the very top of that pyramid that
[21:30] pyramid-looking city and you'll be able
[21:32] to sit down with him and tell him thank
[21:34] you for all that you've done for me and
[21:35] he'll say he'll say go my brother around
[21:37] and say go and enjoy all that just go
[21:39] and enjoy it
[21:40] however he worded it even as i also ever
[21:44] overcome and then sat down with my
[21:46] father in his throne so he's got a
[21:48] throne and the father has his throne and
[21:51] so you can see now that's where he is
[21:53] set down that paul is trying to explain
[21:55] to us and that peter said on the you see
[21:57] why peter said that on the day of
[21:59] pentecost because on the day of
[22:01] pentecost
[22:02] was the first time
[22:04] that god was able to set down
[22:06] on that throne
[22:07] he on the day of pentecost he actually
[22:09] came and dwelt in the believer for the
[22:12] first time that the price had been paid
[22:15] the atonement had been made the blood
[22:16] had been offered uh
[22:18] all all the the rights that were
[22:21] prophesied over the old testament have
[22:23] been fulfilled the way had been made and
[22:25] now deity could come and live and sit
[22:28] himself down on that throne like he
[22:30] always wanted to do
[22:32] and they identified christ of all ages
[22:34] brother adam said
[22:36] then when he died rose ascended and sent
[22:39] by the holy spirit that was the son of
[22:41] god god is a spirit and through the
[22:44] church age it's been son of god and then
[22:46] in the millennium is son of david
[22:48] sitting on the throne ruling that son of
[22:51] david the son of david dispensation is
[22:54] he him sitting on his throne
[22:56] he is ascended up he that overcomes
[22:58] shall sit with me on my throne as i have
[23:01] overcome and sit down on my father's
[23:03] throne he's sitting on the father's
[23:05] throne now
[23:07] but in the millennium he sits upon his
[23:09] own throne because he is the son of
[23:11] david son of man son of god
[23:14] some son of david see it's just
[23:17] perfectly
[23:18] and now
[23:19] and so
[23:20] he he's he's seated on the father's
[23:22] throne until every enemy is conquered so
[23:25] if we go to the next slide
[23:27] we we we're reminded that paul said in
[23:30] first corinthians that death
[23:32] is going to be the last enemy and paul
[23:34] said he said then cometh the end when he
[23:36] shall have delivered up the kingdom to
[23:38] god
[23:39] even the father when he shall have put
[23:41] down all rule
[23:43] and all authority and power
[23:45] for he must reign
[23:46] till he hath put all enemies under his
[23:49] feet the last enemy that shall be
[23:51] destroyed is death now you're wondering
[23:54] why why do we come to church we're
[23:55] coming to church every day that we and i
[23:58] will be closing here in just a moment
[23:59] the reason that we come to church is to
[24:01] see the destruction of all these enemies
[24:04] to see that one that's seated on the
[24:06] throne of our heart have total dominion
[24:08] and total power over sin and sickness
[24:11] and death and and
[24:13] and and grief and sorrow and everything
[24:15] in our lives to give us a joy that
[24:17] passes everything that the world can
[24:18] throw at us
[24:19] because he's set down on the throne of
[24:21] our heart and the last enemy that shall
[24:24] be destroyed is death
[24:26] as he he's got so much power that he's
[24:28] rolling through with holy ghost that
[24:30] holy ghost fire he's rolling through
[24:32] everything that the world can can throw
[24:34] at it just consuming everything until
[24:36] until finally that last trumpets in the
[24:39] bible and in the book of revelation it
[24:40] says all all the kingdoms of the world
[24:43] every everything's been conquered
[24:45] by that by that conqueror
[24:48] now
[24:49] let's go let's close on this next slide
[24:52] so then
[24:53] you might wonder
[24:55] why do we need to understand daniel 70
[24:57] weeks
[24:59] what's the purpose of daniel said in the
[25:00] weeks because daniel 70 weeks paints
[25:03] this picture
[25:04] so that's why brother ram said if you
[25:06] don't understand daniel 70 weeks how are
[25:08] you going to understand the seals
[25:10] because if you don't understand daniel
[25:12] 70 weeks you can't see what god is
[25:14] really doing you can't see that he's set
[25:17] down as christ as the high priest there
[25:19] through the seven church ages you can't
[25:21] see him
[25:23] sitting down at the beginning of this
[25:25] process right
[25:26] in 80 30 he died for us and then he sat
[25:29] down on the day of pentecost and he's
[25:31] been sitting down through the seven
[25:33] church ages and then when it's all
[25:35] accomplished he stands up so that he can
[25:38] go and take his throne
[25:42] all of that picture is painted in daniel
[25:44] 70 weeks so when you begin to really
[25:46] study and maybe you think that it's been
[25:48] a long a long hard slog maybe and things
[25:51] i've i've had i've had people actually
[25:53] cry to me saying i'm having a struggle
[25:56] trying to understand it but then the
[25:58] picture pops into view and you can begin
[26:00] to see it
[26:01] and we'll in the musicians can go ahead
[26:03] and come forward and we'll end that but
[26:05] see you see what christ is doing he's
[26:07] he's painting a picture for us so we'll
[26:09] understand and as the as the word is
[26:11] opened up to us and the seals are
[26:13] revealed to us we begin to understand
[26:15] what god has done for us and to us and
[26:18] how he has redeemed us
[26:20] and that's the picture that's painted in
[26:21] daniel 70 weeks
