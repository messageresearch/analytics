[13:49] [Music]
[13:52] open the eyes of my heart lord

[14:34] you high and lifted
[14:37] up shining in the light
[14:45] pour out your power and love as we
[14:49] see holy holy holy
[15:00] shining in the light of your glory
[15:05] pour out your power and love
[15:09] as we sing holy
[15:14] [Music]
[15:18] holy holy holy holy
[15:31] [Music]
[15:37] amen god bless you good to be in the
[15:39] house of the lord good to be back
[15:42] good to be alive good to be well amen
[15:46] all right by the way of announcements
[15:47] let's get all that out of the way and
[15:49] i've got about six questions
[15:50] that have been asked by some of the some
[15:53] of you in the
[15:54] sanctuary so i'm going to answer them
[15:56] today
[15:57] on what we've been speaking of because i
[15:59] believe if you have a question in your
[16:01] mind
[16:02] you really can't go much further than
[16:04] that than that question if you don't get
[16:05] an answer
[16:07] because that question's always going to
[16:08] be right there and you know who's going
[16:10] to step in
[16:11] and he's going to try to give you an
[16:13] answer and he's always right there first
[16:16] you know that other guy and i did make a
[16:19] boo-boo last sunday and i'm glad y'all
[16:20] caught it
[16:22] i i said god is here to deceive and i
[16:25] meant
[16:25] the god of this evil age is here to
[16:27] deceive so i'm glad you picked that up
[16:29] if you didn't then just take it to my
[16:32] ignorance you knew what i was talking
[16:33] about i was talking about the deceiver
[16:35] god will never deceive you
[16:36] zero i think i said that in the sermon
[16:38] god will never deceive you
[16:40] he's not in a deceiving business he
[16:42] cannot deceive
[16:44] but the other guy can and that's his job
[16:48] is to deceive so i guess you know now
[16:50] brother dale's got uh
[16:51] tested positive for kobe so he's going
[16:53] to be about 10 days
[16:54] quarantined uh so brother aaron will be
[16:57] speaking wednesday night
[17:00] i'll be doing both services next sunday
[17:04] and um i think the next
[17:07] wednesday will be 10 days so we'll we'll
[17:10] we'll find out and see how that goes
[17:12] pray for brother louise he's at brother
[17:13] burley's preaching today
[17:15] and pray for him on his way back
[17:18] uh brother dale called and wants to go
[17:21] back to
[17:22] phase 1.2
[17:25] which means these people are the only
[17:27] people to be in the sanctuary or in the
[17:29] building
[17:30] on wednesday and probably sunday that
[17:33] would be brother joe canada
[17:35] brother anderson brother bob brother
[17:37] aaron obviously if he's going to greet
[17:40] myself and brother terrence brother luis
[17:42] josh brother boyd
[17:44] brother john durant and brother richard
[17:46] roberts
[17:48] and brother danny fountain so that will
[17:50] be the only ones
[17:52] that will attend wednesday night just to
[17:54] make sure
[17:55] that uh we shake this thing out a little
[17:58] bit more
[17:59] there are several churches brother
[18:01] william borlavon just sent us a
[18:03] text and said that their church is shut
[18:04] down they've got
[18:06] 35 or so people something like that
[18:10] that have it now brother tim pruitt's
[18:13] had to close his church
[18:15] because several of them have it brother
[18:17] jason jackson's church had like
[18:19] 40 or 50 people that had it they're
[18:21] doing better i just
[18:23] uh text brother jason back there he's
[18:25] always been asking about mom and dad so
[18:26] i told him about um his
[18:28] wife still has it but she's getting over
[18:31] it so
[18:31] um and he had it so he's got over it so
[18:34] um
[18:35] i think if we'll just i'm just my
[18:37] opinion here we go i'm like trump i'll
[18:38] get myself in trouble
[18:40] don't inject yourself with clorox
[18:44] but if we'll get this thing out of here
[18:45] i think we go through it one time and
[18:47] we'll get it all done
[18:49] instead of us being it's like a pinball
[18:51] machine you know
[18:53] but we serve a god
[18:56] we serve a god that said whatever you
[18:58] need
[19:00] i've already got a cure for there's a
[19:02] bomb in gilead brothers and sisters and
[19:04] i'm telling you that's where i think
[19:06] like
[19:06] brother uh brother bob was saying this
[19:09] morning that's something
[19:10] god wants us to rely on him
[19:13] doctors are good medicine is good
[19:17] but we know who the healer is and he
[19:20] said he'd never leave us or forsake us
[19:21] he said he would take care of us
[19:24] if we go through these things it's for
[19:26] our good
[19:28] amen if you're a child of god it's for
[19:31] your it's for our good so all these
[19:32] things
[19:33] will be for our good so just remember
[19:34] brother aaron we'll be preaching
[19:36] wednesday night and
[19:38] um and these brothers
[19:41] um will be here on wednesday
[19:45] okay so god bless you um these are
[19:48] trying times but you know what it's not
[19:51] it's not um it's not just us
[19:54] it's all around the world and as brother
[19:57] chris was talking about wednesday night
[19:59] the whole world's grown in now
[20:01] yes not just united states not just
[20:03] little george not just church
[20:04] every country in the world is groaning
[20:08] waiting for the manifestation of the
[20:10] sons of god amen so that's me and you
[20:14] so there's got to be something we've got
[20:15] to do
[20:17] amen so and it's all found in the word
[20:20] of god
[20:21] it's not in the creed it's not in the
[20:23] dogma it's right here in the word of god
[20:24] amen and thank god he sent us a prophet
[20:26] to filter that through
[20:28] and to give us the exact answer to
[20:30] whatever we need so
[20:31] god bless you let's bow our heads we'll
[20:33] read first john four
[20:35] um before we get started hey

[23:13] week i want to s we want to talk about
[23:16] twins
[23:18] now remember if we just preached on
[23:20] having a revival and we had a revival
[23:22] and each one of which there's revivals
[23:23] in each one of them if you get an
[23:25] opportunity
[23:26] brother luis doesn't promote this but i
[23:29] would like to tell you
[23:30] he has a podcast called ten thousand
[23:33] worlds remember brother brown said one
[23:34] soul is worth
[23:36] ten thousand worlds so he has a podcast
[23:39] and he has different brothers
[23:42] on the podcast to speak and to give
[23:45] their testimony
[23:46] well he did one with brother zach black
[23:48] and brother michael panungway
[23:50] and just you need to watch him amen
[23:53] you need to watch it and see what god's
[23:55] done in these young brothers lives
[23:56] but it's ten thousand worlds and you can
[23:59] find that uh
[24:00] uh podcast i think it's on youtube isn't
[24:03] it
[24:03] is it on youtube yeah it's on youtube so
[24:05] watch that i would
[24:06] and he's had several different ministers
[24:08] and brother keith brown
[24:09] he does a lot of ministering to people
[24:11] overseas too in spanish
[24:13] um but he does talk you know interview
[24:16] people here in the united states so
[24:17] brother burley williams and different
[24:19] ones
[24:19] so first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe
[24:21] not every spirit
[24:23] but try the spirits whether they be
[24:25] whether they are of god
[24:26] because many false prophets are going
[24:28] out into the world hereby know you the
[24:30] spirit of god
[24:31] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[24:33] christ has come in the flesh
[24:34] is of god and every spirit that
[24:36] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[24:38] in the flesh it's not of god
[24:39] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[24:43] wherever you have heard that it should
[24:45] come and even now already is in the
[24:46] world year of god little children
[24:48] and have overcome them because greater
[24:51] is he this in you than he that's in the
[24:52] world
[24:54] satan can do nothing to the soul of a
[24:57] born-again believer
[24:59] can't touch it it's like a hot burning
[25:02] coal hotter than he's ever felt in his
[25:03] life
[25:04] if he tries to do anything to us but you
[25:06] know what we're sealed in
[25:08] they are of the world therefore speak
[25:09] they of the world and the world heareth
[25:11] them we are of god
[25:12] he that knoweth god heareth us he that
[25:14] is not of god hereth not us hereby know
[25:17] we the spirit of truth
[25:18] and the spirit of arab and now you may
[25:20] be seated in the lord that is blessing
[25:21] we'll stop right there and then read the
[25:22] rest in a little bit
[25:24] we'll answer some of these questions and
[25:25] i think they've got them where they pull
[25:27] them up on the screen
[25:29] but i was to finish my comment
[25:32] we been preaching on revival and i think
[25:36] we've been having a revival in certain
[25:38] people certain certain homes and
[25:41] different things and
[25:42] and brother brown said what when you
[25:44] have a revival it always produces
[25:46] twins okay so we've got twins here today
[25:50] if we
[25:50] if we confess that we're in a revival
[25:55] then the other guy's gonna be here there
[25:57] was two twins born
[25:59] and remember those twins
[26:02] you can't birth twins out of two
[26:04] different wounds
[26:09] every twin that's born comes from the
[26:11] same womb
[26:13] amen eve
[26:17] esau and jacob all the different twins
[26:20] now
[26:20] we know when you come down to jesus and
[26:22] judas that didn't
[26:24] happen but that's a type okay but now
[26:27] all the ones that we're going to talk
[26:28] about in a little while
[26:30] come from the same womb brother brown
[26:32] said a holy
[26:34] mother and father and here comes jacob
[26:36] and esau jacob i love these all have i
[26:38] hated it came from the same womb
[26:39] so it's not that it comes from the womb
[26:43] it's just that they have two different
[26:44] spirits
[26:46] that what affect each one all right so
[26:48] here's here's five
[26:49] questions and i want to answer these and
[26:52] i tell you if you ever have a question
[26:53] write them down because
[26:55] questions to me helps you move forward
[26:59] with god
[27:00] if you sit there today with a question
[27:02] in your mind
[27:04] then what's going to happen you're going
[27:06] to stay right there that question is
[27:08] going to be right there
[27:10] until god either answers the question or
[27:12] he brother brown said he would put
[27:13] somebody in the pulpit
[27:15] to answer your question all right so
[27:17] let's remember now when we get started
[27:20] i want you to remember one thing i
[27:21] should have spoke on this
[27:23] to begin with because the bible
[27:26] is written in symbols
[27:30] amen remember somebody preached on that
[27:31] not too long symbols
[27:34] and allegories now let me read what an
[27:37] allegory is an allegory is a story
[27:40] a poem or a picture that can be
[27:43] interpreted to reveal
[27:45] a hidden meaning
[27:48] typically a moral or political one
[27:51] pilgrim's progress
[27:52] is an allegory of the spiritual journey
[27:56] all right so when we look and we see
[27:57] that moses
[27:59] wrote the book of genesis and the exodus
[28:01] and all the different ones
[28:03] he did speak and write in symbols and
[28:05] allegory
[28:06] look at the book of revelations the book
[28:09] of revelations is brother brown preached
[28:11] the book of symbols
[28:12] and that symbol represented something
[28:14] else
[28:16] amen same way with an allegory so if we
[28:19] look at these allegories and symbols
[28:22] in the book of genesis to me it was to
[28:26] hide it
[28:26] from the wise and prudent and to reveal
[28:29] it just as
[28:30] you and i know for a fact what happened
[28:32] in the garden
[28:33] i knew what happened in the garden when
[28:34] i was 14 years old i was coming of age
[28:37] and i read
[28:37] what brother brown said and i read what
[28:39] the bible said and i'm like no they
[28:41] ain't
[28:42] there's no fruit apple apricot pear
[28:46] gonna mess me up except
[28:49] i eat too much of them and that's just
[28:52] brother
[28:52] you know brother jesus you know what he
[28:54] said he said it's not what goes in
[28:56] because it goes out through the draw
[28:59] amen
[28:59] but it's what goes in here amen so we're
[29:02] talking about allegories
[29:04] and symbols here today because some of
[29:07] the questions
[29:08] are like number one how did god form the
[29:11] process
[29:11] man from his spoken word now we can
[29:14] answer that by hebrews 11.
[29:16] hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the
[29:18] substance of things hoped for
[29:20] the evidence of things not seen for by
[29:22] the elders obtained by
[29:23] by it the elders are tamed a good report
[29:25] through faith we understand that the
[29:26] worlds
[29:28] were framed by the word of god
[29:31] so that things which are seen were not
[29:34] made of things which do appear listen we
[29:36] serve a god that
[29:37] he doesn't need uh he's he's so far
[29:40] above a scientist because a scientist
[29:42] needs what
[29:44] needs something yes
[29:48] some kind of chemical some kind of this
[29:50] some kind of iron some kind
[29:52] they need something to put together to
[29:54] create a reaction
[29:55] god does not the same way he formed man
[29:59] is the same way he formed the world by
[30:02] the spoken word of god
[30:04] and that formed and and i want to say
[30:07] this too if you want to this comes from
[30:10] genesis 2
[30:11] 7 and thank god for a prophet now if you
[30:13] read what the prophet said you'd answer
[30:15] that question for you
[30:16] talking about genesis 2 7 god formed man
[30:20] out of the dust of the earth he said
[30:22] adam looked like a tree
[30:25] with his feet like roots i can just see
[30:27] i've been to the
[30:28] um well that pottery place is right
[30:31] across the road and i grew up
[30:32] in the pottery business because that was
[30:35] my first job
[30:36] was getting the the uh padre out of the
[30:39] kill but you watch them they take this
[30:41] big wad and they just throw it down on a
[30:43] wheel
[30:44] turn the wheel on and they start forming
[30:46] it with their hands and you know what
[30:47] they'll
[30:48] they'll mash it like this and then when
[30:49] they start here that brings up the side
[30:52] of the
[30:52] of the of the bowl and they form it well
[30:55] see i can see god do the same thing
[30:59] same way that god walked up one day and
[31:01] said all right
[31:03] i want to take uh michael and gabriel
[31:07] and we're going to go visit moses
[31:09] brother brown said god just took 16
[31:11] elements and just kind of
[31:12] sprinkled it and walked through it when
[31:14] he did it just formed a body
[31:16] to me that's the same way adam was adam
[31:18] was there
[31:20] god formed this body and then he put
[31:22] adam inside that body
[31:25] it's human body just like this but you
[31:26] know what where did we come from
[31:29] we were formed in the womb
[31:33] but we were formed by what was eat by
[31:35] your mama and your daddy
[31:37] amen so there's nothing new under the
[31:39] sun you came from the same earth adam
[31:41] did basically the same
[31:43] except god formed adam
[31:48] and then as a grown man you and i had to
[31:50] come as a baby because of what we're
[31:52] talking about because of the fall
[31:54] so everybody got that so god formed a
[31:55] man the same process as hebrews 11
[31:59] and then the bible tells how can we talk
[32:01] to the potter how can we tell the potter
[32:03] why'd you make me this way
[32:05] he's the former he's the one and you
[32:07] know why he forms you the way you are
[32:09] because if you're a child if you're a
[32:11] son and daughter of god that's the way
[32:13] you looked
[32:13] in his attribute and brother chris was
[32:15] talking about wednesday night
[32:17] that he saw you you and i
[32:20] as men and women we didn't see our
[32:22] children before we had them because
[32:24] we're what
[32:25] we're finite but he's infinite he knew
[32:28] that michael paneuway would wait till
[32:31] he was 19 years old or whatever age he
[32:34] is
[32:34] and that's the way he's going to look
[32:37] and that was what god had in his mind
[32:40] and as brother bob was talking about the
[32:41] miracle that we're keep talking about of
[32:43] how
[32:44] god had that image in his mind and he
[32:47] had to bring
[32:50] great great great great great grandma
[32:52] grandpa all the way down
[32:55] get them over here to make him to form
[32:58] that
[32:59] image that god already saw before the
[33:01] foundation of the world boy what a
[33:03] wonderful god
[33:04] so how did god form the process he
[33:07] formed him was the same as what brother
[33:08] brown said
[33:09] he said it looked like adam was like
[33:12] roots
[33:14] because remember i told you the bible
[33:15] said men i see men as trees
[33:17] we're upright beings there's trees and
[33:19] that god just
[33:21] i believe he just twisted some 16
[33:24] elements of the earth and he just
[33:26] put a soul inside that man called adam
[33:29] and he just started walking around
[33:31] how simple is that but you and i had to
[33:34] be formed a little different we had to
[33:35] be formed in the womb is that okay now i
[33:38] think this
[33:38] second question was
[33:42] i never said god didn't form lucifer
[33:44] knowing what he would do
[33:45] god did form lucifer knowing what he
[33:47] would do
[33:48] there's nothing god doesn't know amen so
[33:51] if that question may have been asked a
[33:53] little bit wrong or
[33:54] or something or or misrepresented but
[33:57] there's nothing god didn't know
[33:59] so you can't say that he didn't know
[34:01] lucifer would be that way he knew
[34:03] and lucifer was an attribute of god but
[34:05] he was not that
[34:06] attribute of the person of god
[34:12] everybody got that because the angels
[34:14] and all that they were attributes of god
[34:16] he made them to worship him
[34:18] yes right he made them to worship him
[34:23] lucifer was included he wanted lucifer
[34:26] to be the head guy
[34:27] you say well why why why why he made
[34:30] adam to be the head guy
[34:32] god likes to give us like moses
[34:36] moses you take too much on yourself well
[34:38] just go divide yourself out
[34:40] on the day of pentecost he didn't just
[34:41] put the holy ghost in one man and put
[34:42] him in 120 people
[34:44] women and men included and sent them out
[34:47] into the world
[34:48] to what make more of him all right so
[34:50] god didn't form lucifer
[34:53] not knowing what he would do he knew
[34:56] what was going to happen
[34:57] but he made lucifer he made lucifer
[35:00] perfect i don't read that
[35:02] it's in the bible he's perfect he was
[35:04] beautiful
[35:05] until iniquity was what found in him not
[35:08] even not in god
[35:10] he gave was given a choice just like you
[35:12] and i have given a choice just like all
[35:14] the other angels
[35:15] but he was an attribute of god but he
[35:17] was not an eternal attribute of god
[35:21] there is only one eternal attribute of
[35:23] god there is only one
[35:24] lounge book of life eternal section the
[35:26] prophet said
[35:27] and that's what brother chris and i we
[35:29] were talking about the other day and he
[35:30] spoke on it wednesday
[35:31] that's the part satan can't stand he
[35:33] can't touch god has set that aside
[35:35] and there's no way that lucifer can
[35:37] touch that
[35:39] it's going to happen his children are
[35:42] going to come
[35:42] that's the way god had it planned and
[35:44] that's the way they're going to come and
[35:46] lucifer can pervert all he wants to
[35:49] but there's one group of people he
[35:51] cannot get
[35:54] and that's that genesis 1 26 man
[35:57] the bride of jesus christ
[36:00] he cannot get us doesn't matter it
[36:02] doesn't matter if we everyone have to
[36:04] die except one person
[36:06] if one person stands and says
[36:09] i'm not gonna die i am going to speak
[36:13] and all these are going to come out of
[36:14] the grave
[36:15] it doesn't matter if it's one person
[36:18] satan's not going to win because guess
[36:20] what i don't i don't think i think satan
[36:22] can go anywhere he wants to
[36:24] except that sixth dimension
[36:28] because remember that's what brother
[36:29] brown said that's perfect love
[36:32] satan don't have that satan doesn't have
[36:34] perfect love
[36:35] isn't perfect love he's a perverted love
[36:38] that's why he's down here in the
[36:39] dimension one two three and four
[36:41] doing what he's doing he cannot get in
[36:44] that sixth dimension
[36:45] well no i love it when when you know you
[36:48] do a funeral i i did part of richard
[36:50] um by richard marlow's funeral
[36:53] you know you take the death angel and
[36:55] you know most time death angel he's
[36:56] going to take him to the fifth dimension
[36:57] because that's where
[36:58] the biggest path is if you don't believe
[37:02] that you need to believe brother branham
[37:03] said you have an
[37:04] angel a death angel and you have an
[37:06] angel that comes and takes you across
[37:07] the river you have an angel that does
[37:09] this
[37:09] because you're breaking over another
[37:10] dimension your body's still here
[37:12] yes but what about when a saint that's
[37:15] why the bible says we need to rejoice
[37:17] when the saint goes home we need to
[37:19] rejoice
[37:21] why because he's going or she's going
[37:23] over into a place that satan knows
[37:25] nothing about
[37:26] he knows all the other ones
[37:30] but he doesn't know anything about that
[37:31] one and when the death angel shows up
[37:34] the
[37:34] you know i believe then all of a sudden
[37:36] here comes this white light in and says
[37:37] no
[37:38] i think i'll take this one um this one's
[37:41] going where uh
[37:42] i don't think you even know where it's
[37:43] at yeah i'm taking this one in the sixth
[37:46] dimension you
[37:47] you can you have all those other ones
[37:48] you want but i'm taking that one
[37:50] what a what a mighty god we serve even
[37:52] in death
[37:54] that's why paul says death where's your
[37:56] sting
[37:57] grave where's your victory why brother
[37:58] brown said i was afraid of death at one
[38:00] time
[38:01] he said but when i went across that
[38:02] curtain of time he said no
[38:04] never again well i'll be afraid of death
[38:07] all right so god did know
[38:11] he did form lucifer knowing what he
[38:12] would do but he didn't form lucifer
[38:15] to do what he did everybody got that
[38:18] if he did listen god is a judge
[38:22] he's a righteous judge and to be a judge
[38:24] you have to have
[38:25] two opposing views right
[38:29] a defense and a prosecution all right
[38:32] so everything when when when you walk up
[38:35] to the white throne judgment
[38:36] we don't have to but if somebody walks
[38:38] up there's going to be a time where god
[38:40] says i've contacted you and you turned
[38:42] me down
[38:43] he's already saw what lucifer's done so
[38:45] lucifer that's why the bible said he's
[38:47] already judged
[38:48] he's just going straight into the lake
[38:50] of fire why because back before
[38:51] time he did what he was going to do
[38:56] and he took part of the angels with him
[38:57] and they're going with him also
[38:59] all right so everybody got that say amen
[39:02] so that was number two i think that was
[39:03] just a slip of maybe i said it but i
[39:05] don't think i did
[39:06] but god did form lucifer knowing what he
[39:08] would do so there's nothing god doesn't
[39:10] know
[39:11] if not he's not god amen all right now
[39:14] number three
[39:15] i need to explain that because i told i
[39:17] told you last sunday that the apex of
[39:20] both spirits are setting here today
[39:22] now what is the apex of both spirits
[39:24] let's go to
[39:26] uh matthew 24 24 let me read this for
[39:29] there shall arise false christ and false
[39:30] prophets
[39:32] shall show great signs and wonders and
[39:33] so much that if it were possible
[39:35] they shall deceive the very elect see
[39:37] that's the apex you're so close
[39:40] here in the end time i i've been
[39:43] studying a little bit more and
[39:45] man you ought to get a little bit closer
[39:47] to where where you know like i said
[39:49] judas judas stood
[39:52] right there at the night before the
[39:55] crucifixion
[39:57] and nobody knew he was the devil
[40:02] only jesus christ knew only the son of
[40:04] man and then we look at this
[40:06] we see this same you say apex sitting
[40:08] here so the apex
[40:10] of both is sitting here what is the
[40:12] difference in the other ages let me just
[40:14] go through that real quick
[40:16] because jesus christ was the son of man
[40:18] is that all right say amen there's
[40:20] nothing else on there you've got to
[40:21] listen to me
[40:22] jesus christ is the son of man he was
[40:24] the headstone to the church he was the
[40:27] one that established the church
[40:29] and he was the headstone amen which is
[40:33] what headstone the apex that's that
[40:34] little pyramid right up there at the
[40:36] very top
[40:37] but he had to become the chief
[40:39] cornerstone
[40:41] on the day of pentecost as the son of
[40:44] god
[40:45] yes everybody got that same man as the
[40:48] son of god through the church ages
[40:50] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:53] but in the end time he's got to come
[40:55] back as what
[40:56] the son of man so instead of being just
[40:59] the cornerstone
[41:02] he was the you know upon this rock i'll
[41:03] be on my church he built his church on
[41:05] what
[41:06] revelation so you come up to right here
[41:08] and this elijah
[41:09] as we were talking yesterday or today
[41:12] one
[41:13] this elijah is supposed to turn our
[41:16] hearts back
[41:18] remember this messenger of maokai forced
[41:20] to do two things
[41:22] restore back what restore us back
[41:26] to here because you've got to go back to
[41:27] the foundation of the faith of the
[41:29] fathers
[41:30] go up this pyramid of me and brother
[41:32] talking joseph somebody was preaching on
[41:34] it thank god people are preaching on the
[41:35] statue of a perfect man after all these
[41:38] years
[41:39] but right here's where you and i that's
[41:41] the apex what's the
[41:42] what was the apex of god jesus christ
[41:47] you say no no the father it was the
[41:49] father made manifest
[41:50] you and i didn't get saved by the father
[41:54] we got saved by the son which is the
[41:57] same person but just in another form
[41:59] but we look to him knowing that that son
[42:01] of man had to come on earth
[42:03] die in human flesh because remember god
[42:06] can't die as a spirit
[42:07] so the son of god can't die the son of
[42:10] man died and we can relate to that and
[42:13] we relate to that man hanging on the
[42:15] cross
[42:16] and that's the apex of god
[42:20] his whole plan and purpose was to die so
[42:23] that you and i could be saved but all
[42:25] during the other church ages
[42:26] it wasn't required i was listening this
[42:29] morning brother bradley was
[42:31] preaching on satan's eden you know all
[42:33] satan's got to do is
[42:35] he he can quote you now 100
[42:38] of the word because you know what he
[42:39] says he says okay you need to do like
[42:41] wesley
[42:43] and just quit your drinking and smoking
[42:44] and make sure you come to church sell
[42:45] them front row
[42:47] leave a little singing and you're fine
[42:51] see now that was fine in wesley's age
[42:53] that's what brother brown was talking
[42:54] about that was fine in wesley's age
[42:56] and if satan can get you to believe that
[42:58] that's where you need to be
[43:00] and that's your holy ghost he's got you
[43:07] quoting you a hundred percent of the
[43:09] word
[43:11] but he placed it in the wrong place
[43:13] because sanctification under wesley will
[43:15] not even get us
[43:16] born again so see we have to move now
[43:20] doesn't it doesn't say that that you
[43:22] know the
[43:23] the satan denied the word no he said oh
[43:26] yeah you're good
[43:28] you know what you come here with this
[43:30] eternal thing in you
[43:31] and while you just come to church and
[43:34] you just believe
[43:35] brother branham was a prophet and just
[43:38] believe
[43:38] that and and just sit right there this
[43:42] statue of perfect man now
[43:43] once saved always saved you got it
[43:45] everything's fine you
[43:46] you you're you're born again
[43:50] see how close that is but if you're born
[43:53] again in this age
[43:55] you're not only going to have the new
[43:56] birth but you're going to desire and
[43:59] have to go up that statue of a perfect
[44:01] man
[44:01] because the apex of all the word what is
[44:04] apex mean
[44:06] as far as you can go here as far as we
[44:09] can go on this earth folks is this
[44:11] message
[44:12] yes and if we're not in it a hundred
[44:14] percent we can't be in luther we can
[44:16] quote them
[44:17] but we can't be in luther wesley our
[44:19] pentecost we've got to do what brother
[44:21] brown said this messenger malachi 4 does
[44:23] two things
[44:24] turns a heart back to the original faith
[44:27] and
[44:28] brings what the seven seals the seven
[44:31] thunders what is that
[44:32] who was the seal jesus christ
[44:36] he was the head
[44:39] we're looking at headship now we're
[44:41] looking at the headstone
[44:43] not sure we're the body of jesus christ
[44:45] but we've got to bring the bible says
[44:47] bring the headstone crying what grace
[44:50] grace unto it that's what this age is
[44:52] for i'm telling you
[44:54] as brother bob was saying this morning
[44:56] just sitting here even having the new
[44:57] birth is not good in this age
[45:00] it's okay you're born again
[45:05] but you can die
[45:09] a baby will die if you don't feed it
[45:12] but if you'll feed it good food and then
[45:15] work its way
[45:16] up to meat
[45:20] from milk work its way up to meat then
[45:22] what
[45:23] you can be a fully developed human being
[45:26] using an allegory same way with your new
[45:29] birth you start as a little baby
[45:31] when when right
[45:35] when the baby cries listen zoe and
[45:36] kaylee i remember when they were born i
[45:38] remember actually went afterwards
[45:40] zach too me and mom was talking about
[45:42] the other night
[45:44] oh lord but anyway um
[45:48] now how did you grow up though you was a
[45:50] cute little kid
[45:52] and so were they they're all just a cute
[45:54] bunch of little kids but you know what
[45:55] if they would have just took them and
[45:57] set them over in the closet and said
[45:58] prettiest set of twins you ever seen in
[46:00] your life and they were
[46:04] put them in a closet and shut the door
[46:06] they would have died
[46:09] because they didn't get fed and then
[46:11] when zoe and kaylee started crying
[46:14] you didn't shove a piece of steak in
[46:16] their mouth
[46:18] you fed them
[46:21] milk because you ain't got no teeth but
[46:25] paul said he said eating strong meat
[46:30] having left all that let's go to the
[46:33] apex
[46:34] now remember paul didn't reach the apex
[46:36] he was looking to it
[46:38] we use his words which is the word of
[46:41] god
[46:42] we use his words his sermons his all the
[46:46] different writings in the new testament
[46:47] to reach the apex but he never reached
[46:50] it
[46:51] but he was looking at it he said looking
[46:53] to the altar and finisher of our faith
[46:55] he said i know there's a people that's
[46:57] coming
[46:58] amen and we're here this is it there is
[47:01] no other person
[47:03] besides us so that's why we're the apex
[47:06] even when god goes to the jews he's
[47:08] going to reveal himself as jesus christ
[47:11] but not in the way of us because he's
[47:14] our husband
[47:16] we are intimate with him now that's the
[47:18] intimacy
[47:19] between the head and the body uniting
[47:24] not going to happen in israel they're
[47:25] not going to get him as husband
[47:28] they're going to get him as a redeemer
[47:30] now we get him his redeemer but we
[47:32] learn to know him as husband amen
[47:36] and so that's wonderful that we are
[47:38] looking at the apex
[47:39] of all things and the apex is sitting
[47:41] here even in the
[47:43] even in the other part the other guy
[47:46] because it's so close he's not out there
[47:50] he's right here telling you you're fine
[47:53] yeah it's just you're good you're you're
[47:55] good don't don't you just feel good
[47:57] today
[47:58] boy that sermon brother bob this morning
[47:59] man that was of course some of you slept
[48:01] through it but that's okay
[48:03] but you know it wasn't that so good that
[48:05] was good
[48:06] but what did it do for you
[48:09] eat it john
[48:13] eat the book see there's another
[48:15] allegory we're going to get to a
[48:16] question down here
[48:17] why does the bible say the woman saw the
[48:18] tree was good for food come on we gotta
[48:20] quit being so carnal
[48:24] food is a sustainer we eat spiritual
[48:27] food brother brown preached a message
[48:29] spiritual food in due season
[48:31] now what are we gonna do with it throw
[48:32] it in the corner
[48:34] no we're gonna eat it i planted a
[48:37] wonderful garden this year
[48:38] we're eating we're feasting off of that
[48:40] garden brother dale has planted many
[48:42] many wonderful gardens and we're eating
[48:46] that food that's come off of it brother
[48:47] brown preached 1100
[48:49] gardens that things could grow out of
[48:52] that we can what
[48:53] eat we come to church every sunday to
[48:55] eat
[48:57] all right so let's but let's finish down
[48:58] let's get down through so that's number
[49:00] three the apex number four
[49:03] why did eve need to go get her husband
[49:06] if they were equal let's read genesis
[49:08] three verse six that they don't have it
[49:09] here but i'm gonna read it
[49:11] we're gonna read it in a minute if we
[49:12] ever get to it and when the woman saw
[49:14] that the tree was good for food
[49:16] and it was pleasant to the eye remember
[49:17] allegories
[49:19] symbols there's not a tree that's good
[49:24] that's pleasing to the eye and a tree to
[49:27] be desired to make one wise she took of
[49:30] the fruit thereof
[49:31] and did eat and gave also unto her
[49:33] husband with her
[49:34] and he did it and the eyes of them both
[49:37] this is the answer
[49:38] question number five too and the eyes of
[49:40] them both were opened so
[49:42] they knew that they were naked and they
[49:45] sewed fig leaves together and made
[49:46] themselves
[49:48] aprons now let's read the question why
[49:50] did he need to go get her husband
[49:53] if they were equal now remember
[49:57] she was still a female
[50:00] and he was still a male anybody got that
[50:05] even in the form before the fall they
[50:08] walked around on the planet
[50:09] earth naked and he had his part and she
[50:13] had her part
[50:14] but they had the holy ghost veil over
[50:16] them to keep them from being what
[50:19] carnal like i said before you take a
[50:21] two-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl
[50:23] put them in a bathtub they can play all
[50:25] day long and they have nothing to fear
[50:27] and you have nothing to fear
[50:30] wait about 15 years later and don't ever
[50:32] do that
[50:33] right what changed
[50:37] their carnal mind the carnal minds what
[50:39] changed cause they still had everything
[50:41] they needed right then
[50:42] everybody understand what i'm saying all
[50:44] right so why did eve need to go get her
[50:46] husband why
[50:47] she wanted to present him
[50:51] remember the devil preached her sermon
[50:54] and beguiled her well he went and she
[50:58] went and said
[50:58] told the same thing to adam because
[51:00] remember what happened when god came
[51:02] down
[51:03] god said adam what have you done who
[51:04] told you you were naked he said my wife
[51:08] and then she said well what's wrong with
[51:09] you she said the beast see they went
[51:11] down the line well
[51:12] they had to come this way in the line to
[51:14] start with everybody got that
[51:16] and brother brown even makes it so
[51:17] specific he said she was with the beast
[51:19] in the morning and with adam in the
[51:21] afternoon now
[51:22] you go talk to him if you need to talk
[51:24] to him about that okay
[51:25] but i believe what a prophet said then
[51:27] he takes it to the
[51:29] to the uh case in 1964 i think it was or
[51:32] somewhere
[51:33] where the the white lady had relations
[51:36] with a black man in the morning and her
[51:38] husband in the evening
[51:39] and they had a set of twins and they
[51:41] were not the same one was
[51:42] black one was white everybody we knew
[51:44] that all right
[51:46] so why did he need to go get her husband
[51:49] she was giving him some revelation
[51:52] that's what got him in trouble it should
[51:54] have went reversed the other way
[51:56] everybody got that adam like what
[52:00] brother brown said
[52:01] adam had the intelligence now it wasn't
[52:03] that easy was an idiot
[52:06] but adam was adam was what the son of
[52:09] god
[52:10] i believe god talked to adam when he did
[52:12] eve
[52:13] i just say that because he formed adam
[52:15] first
[52:17] then eve because remember eve was
[52:20] deceived
[52:22] adam wasn't so when she presented the
[52:25] product to him
[52:26] now i don't agree because i have a quote
[52:30] either here at home and i always keep it
[52:32] there because you know you hear these
[52:33] people with these
[52:34] with these doctrines of the two seed
[52:36] lines and adam's seed was righteous
[52:40] no adam's literal seed is what polluted
[52:44] the world come on people
[52:46] so you can't run seedline natural seed
[52:49] lines
[52:51] adam's seed polluted this entire world
[52:54] because he kept procreating too god done
[52:57] away with the beast
[53:00] it was adam you say no seth yes
[53:03] seth represented righteousness but he
[53:06] wasn't righteous
[53:07] he needed a sacrifice too
[53:10] every person since adam needed a
[53:13] sacrifice
[53:14] why did abel need one if he was so
[53:16] righteous now i know the bible
[53:18] says that he was righteous you got to
[53:19] look at that though
[53:21] he's not so righteous that he was
[53:23] perfect and didn't need to sacrifice
[53:25] because that's what got him killed
[53:27] was he presented the right sacrifice why
[53:30] do you need a sacrifice for if he was
[53:31] perfect
[53:34] he got a revelation of what happened
[53:37] but eve produced the product to adam and
[53:40] adam said oh buddy
[53:41] but now remember like i said he didn't
[53:43] do the natural act
[53:45] to preserve eve i believe he knew what
[53:47] he did and she was so much a part of him
[53:50] he didn't want to lose her they didn't
[53:53] know what jesus christ did he didn't sit
[53:55] here and ask you a thousand questions
[53:56] why you didn't
[53:58] why you didn't get born again when you
[54:00] was 12.
[54:02] no he knew when he was going to get born
[54:03] again and that's the intimacy between
[54:05] you and god because god knew when you
[54:06] wanted it when you wanted him to be
[54:08] your husband your lover amen
[54:13] so adam couldn't destroy eve just like
[54:16] christ
[54:16] couldn't destroy listen he didn't
[54:18] destroy israel
[54:21] when israel went whoring and did all
[54:22] those bad things
[54:24] god didn't destroy her he put her away
[54:28] he's coming back to get 144 000 out of
[54:31] that
[54:32] amen same way with me and you
[54:35] lord look at rahab look at all the
[54:37] different things that he brought out of
[54:38] all that
[54:39] talk about this natural line lord
[54:42] rahab was in pitiful shape
[54:45] she was a prostitute she knew everybody
[54:47] in the whole city
[54:48] every man
[54:52] but what did god do he just wiped the
[54:53] whole city out and said wow where's your
[54:55] accuser
[54:56] she said no i don't have none
[55:00] i don't know yes rahab anymore you're my
[55:02] bride
[55:04] why did eve need to get her husband
[55:05] because he wanted to present she wanted
[55:07] to present what she had done
[55:08] and once she did present because
[55:10] remember she was so deceived she thought
[55:12] she was doing what god said
[55:15] everybody got that that's what the
[55:17] prophet said she was deceived the bible
[55:19] says she was deceived and not
[55:21] adam because when she present
[55:24] produced i think brother brown said
[55:25] produce the product to adam
[55:28] he knew if he didn't do something that
[55:30] god would kill her
[55:32] so he took her and shielded her and had
[55:35] the act with her
[55:36] knowing he was selling out the human
[55:38] race but he had so much love just like
[55:40] jesus christ didn't put you away
[55:43] when he was out there doing all your
[55:44] whoring and i don't mind if you say oh
[55:47] yeah we all were we were
[55:50] to the devil
[55:52] amen but christ didn't hold out against
[55:55] us
[55:56] he said you're my bride
[56:01] paul said the things i would not i do
[56:03] the things i do it would not that worry
[56:05] but not in the soul your soul is either
[56:08] born again
[56:09] or it's dead white or black
[56:14] and if it's white then yeah satan can
[56:15] play with that like he did with leave he
[56:17] can play with her memory reason
[56:18] conscious effects and imagination
[56:20] and what happened was as eve took in the
[56:23] womb of her mind
[56:24] first
[56:27] two wombs boom of the mind and the
[56:29] natural one
[56:30] the womb of the mind mary had to accept
[56:33] it in the natural womb first
[56:36] because she had to believe it she had to
[56:37] believe something that never happened
[56:38] before
[56:39] but when she said be it unto me
[56:41] according to thy word it dropped down
[56:43] and god said okay i'll use you
[56:46] same way with me and you when you got
[56:48] born again i believe that's what you
[56:49] said you said god
[56:50] be it unto me according to that word you
[56:53] said if i do all these things and get
[56:55] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[56:56] christ
[56:57] that you would fill me with the holy
[56:58] ghost and here i am
[57:00] be it unto me according to thy word and
[57:02] then boom
[57:04] he placed that seed spiritual like it
[57:07] should have been had there not been a
[57:08] fall
[57:10] because i believe adam and eve would
[57:11] have come together not sexually
[57:14] but where did adam come from where did
[57:16] adam eve come from they come directly
[57:18] from the mind of god
[57:19] they didn't come from the mind of their
[57:21] mom and daddy they didn't have one
[57:23] they came from the very creator himself
[57:27] they were part of the creation
[57:30] amen and by the new birth
[57:35] you did the same thing now genesis 1 26
[57:39] man is unfolding as we speak
[57:42] right here right here any of the new
[57:46] ones
[57:48] thank you let us make man
[57:53] in our own image it's okay michael
[57:58] i know you got to come through your mom
[58:00] and your daddy because of what happened
[58:02] because what it done it made a chasm and
[58:04] we may not get to it today
[58:06] but in genesis 3 15 he says i'll put
[58:08] enmity
[58:11] a division remember when lazarus
[58:15] was was dead and the rich young ruler
[58:17] died too
[58:18] what did the rich young ruler he said i
[58:20] want to go over there
[58:22] and the bible says there's a great gulf
[58:24] fixed
[58:25] what was that golf choice
[58:28] they should have made it on the other
[58:30] side
[58:32] like who was preaching another about the
[58:34] people you look down at hell they're
[58:35] crawling all over hell trying to get
[58:37] back
[58:37] so they can make one more choice see
[58:40] what i'm saying
[58:41] you cross that chasm so in genesis 3 15
[58:43] god made a chasm he said i'm going to
[58:45] put enmity between thy seed
[58:47] and the seed of the woman but what he
[58:49] was telling him was that that
[58:51] seed of the woman which a woman doesn't
[58:53] have a seed
[58:54] so he was going to create again
[58:57] a part of himself
[59:00] and he was going to bridge the gap back
[59:08] what a mighty god we serve he's going to
[59:10] put that thing right back together
[59:13] so that it doesn't matter if you come
[59:15] from a prostitute and a drunk
[59:17] that doesn't matter
[59:21] it's knowing who your daddy is from the
[59:23] eternal side
[59:25] i wish people would get that together in
[59:27] the message
[59:28] when brother brown talks about you
[59:30] always were eternal you always wear this
[59:32] seed
[59:32] that is the mind of that genesis 1 26
[59:35] and 27 man
[59:37] not what came from your natural parents
[59:41] because you were born dead
[59:45] abel was born dead cain was born
[59:49] dead seth was born dead
[59:53] moses was born dead may i just continue
[59:57] on
[59:58] william branham was born dead
[1:00:02] now in the mind of god there was a place
[1:00:06] a spot like brother said talks about
[1:00:08] that button that button's not inside you
[1:00:10] you have no eternal life inside you
[1:00:12] because you came under your first birth
[1:00:14] why'd you need a new one
[1:00:17] but look how close it is though satan
[1:00:19] says
[1:00:21] well i think you were just something
[1:00:22] special and you you came with this
[1:00:24] little special something
[1:00:27] no you were born in sin
[1:00:30] shaping an iniquity spouse from your
[1:00:33] mother's womb a liar
[1:00:36] but i got a quote oh listen you can
[1:00:38] fight quotes all day
[1:00:39] but the bible says you were born in sin
[1:00:44] shape and iniquity you were lost
[1:00:47] and needed a savior now whatever quote
[1:00:50] you want to mix into that that's fine
[1:00:51] with me but i'm going to tell you what
[1:00:52] the bible says
[1:00:53] and i believe william branham knew what
[1:00:55] the bible said but what brother branham
[1:00:57] was doing he was at that apex he was up
[1:00:59] there in the mind of god
[1:01:01] telling us because the bible does say if
[1:01:04] the seed remains in you you can't sin
[1:01:06] what
[1:01:06] if the seed remains in you the seed that
[1:01:09] you received when you got the new birth
[1:01:11] not the seed and when you were born with
[1:01:12] a little baby
[1:01:15] why was the bible saying newborn babes
[1:01:19] oh to me see then it makes it so simple
[1:01:23] but then everybody in the message gets
[1:01:24] it so convoluted who is doing that
[1:01:28] the apex of the other guy
[1:01:32] he's got a headstone too he wants it to
[1:01:34] be him
[1:01:36] talking about satan and he wants to
[1:01:39] deceive you by less than one word now
[1:01:43] it's a hundred percent but it's in the
[1:01:44] wrong place amen
[1:01:46] what brother batman say he said don't
[1:01:48] what misrepresent or
[1:01:50] or put a put a word somewhere where it
[1:01:53] don't need to be
[1:01:54] all right that's all you got to do and
[1:01:56] to be one word off
[1:01:57] like we proved the other day satan said
[1:02:00] not
[1:02:02] he quoted everything god said but though
[1:02:04] he put that word not in it
[1:02:06] all right that not head
[1:02:10] well that still didn't wake any of you
[1:02:12] all right so why did he need to go get
[1:02:14] her husband why because she wanted
[1:02:15] she thought she was right she wanted to
[1:02:18] produce the product to him and say look
[1:02:19] this is what we're supposed to do
[1:02:21] and then adam's going oh man
[1:02:26] but you're my wife i can't take another
[1:02:29] one this is
[1:02:30] this is me because she was literally him
[1:02:35] literally that was of his body so you
[1:02:38] and i by the new birth are literally the
[1:02:40] body of jesus christ
[1:02:41] amen that's hard to swallow but you need
[1:02:44] to
[1:02:46] okay so five is basically the same thing
[1:02:49] why did eve not realize she was naked
[1:02:50] she didn't realize she was naked until
[1:02:52] adam and her got together if you read
[1:02:53] what the bible says
[1:02:55] the bible says and gave also to her
[1:02:59] husband with her and he did eat and the
[1:03:00] eyes of them both were opened and they
[1:03:02] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[1:03:04] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:03:06] aprons all right so that's eve
[1:03:10] didn't realize she was listen remember
[1:03:12] eve was deceived just put it there
[1:03:15] the bible says eve was deceived i read
[1:03:18] it last sunday
[1:03:19] but not adam so she in her deception
[1:03:22] she thought she was doing the right
[1:03:24] thing so she was just running around
[1:03:25] like
[1:03:26] it's like people getting born again you
[1:03:27] know everybody needs to get born again
[1:03:29] everybody all know this message why in
[1:03:30] the world don't you know what this
[1:03:31] message is you know brother brown was a
[1:03:32] prophet
[1:03:33] so eve was the same way but she had took
[1:03:35] wrong
[1:03:37] the wrong road she took the wrong road
[1:03:41] she thought she was right but when she
[1:03:43] presented to adam
[1:03:44] adam said look what you've done
[1:03:49] so he sold us out adam sold us out
[1:03:53] he could have he could have said no
[1:03:55] don't worry no more give me another one
[1:03:57] but he couldn't because she was him same
[1:04:00] way with the type
[1:04:00] of christ and the bride so that's number
[1:04:03] five number six
[1:04:04] and i have now remember question number
[1:04:07] six
[1:04:08] why does the bible say the women's woman
[1:04:10] saw that the tree
[1:04:12] was good for food all right everybody
[1:04:14] got that because remember
[1:04:16] genesis 3 verse 6 says that when a woman
[1:04:18] saw the tree was good for food
[1:04:20] and it was pleasant to the eye remember
[1:04:22] allegories
[1:04:24] there's a story here that moses is
[1:04:26] trying to tell us without saying
[1:04:28] that it was sex but i want to read this
[1:04:29] right too listen to this
[1:04:33] this will answer the question psalms 34
[1:04:36] verse 8 says oh
[1:04:38] taste and see
[1:04:42] that the lord is good blessed is the man
[1:04:46] that trusteth in him
[1:04:47] taste and see allegory we're eating off
[1:04:51] the body word of the son of man
[1:04:53] here we need to know that we should have
[1:04:55] known these things but that's okay
[1:04:57] now that we know them move a little move
[1:04:59] a little further move a little higher
[1:05:01] everybody okay all right are we good
[1:05:05] with this
[1:05:06] now listen to this one john 6
[1:05:09] 53 says then when jesus said unto them
[1:05:12] verily verily i say unto you
[1:05:14] except you eat the flesh
[1:05:19] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:05:24] you have no life in you you're dead
[1:05:28] unless you eat of me jesus looked up one
[1:05:31] day in the temple and he said i am the
[1:05:32] bread
[1:05:33] now what do you do with bread just look
[1:05:35] at it no you eat it
[1:05:37] amen taste and see that the lord is good
[1:05:40] eat this bread what
[1:05:43] allegory john 6 54 whosoever eateth my
[1:05:47] flesh
[1:05:48] and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
[1:05:52] must be an allegory or we're all
[1:05:53] vampires we gotta go get jesus
[1:05:55] body and eat it right we're eating off
[1:05:57] the body where the son of man
[1:05:59] listen the tree was good for food
[1:06:01] because she thought she was doing what
[1:06:02] god said
[1:06:05] that's why she thought it was good food
[1:06:07] if you'll understand what happened in
[1:06:09] the garden you'll understand why she
[1:06:10] said it was good for food
[1:06:12] hello all our adults are going amen
[1:06:15] okay why does the bible say that the
[1:06:17] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:06:18] food it's an allegory
[1:06:20] jesus said 6 50. john 6 55 for my flesh
[1:06:23] is meat and deed and my blood is drink
[1:06:26] indeed
[1:06:27] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:06:30] blood dwelleth in me and i in him
[1:06:33] now boy if you just take that as natural
[1:06:34] then we all got to be vampires
[1:06:37] but if you take it as an allegory that
[1:06:39] he was telling them he was good
[1:06:42] food to eat as satan was telling the
[1:06:45] woman
[1:06:46] this is good food right here
[1:06:49] jesus christ is saying i'm the bread
[1:06:53] i'm the food you need to be eating
[1:06:56] listen i'm going to tell you something
[1:06:58] folks
[1:07:00] you and i eat off of something every day
[1:07:02] now i'm not talking about natural food
[1:07:05] we feed off some kind of food every day
[1:07:08] satan will feed you food and god will
[1:07:10] give you food what is our food
[1:07:12] the word of god yes what's this food
[1:07:14] everything else
[1:07:16] amen and it might sound good look good
[1:07:18] and tastes good
[1:07:20] but it's not so everybody okay with that
[1:07:23] why does the bible say the woman saw the
[1:07:24] tree was good for food
[1:07:26] why she thought she was doing something
[1:07:27] she thought she was progressing
[1:07:30] she thought she was doing what god said
[1:07:33] that's why a woman
[1:07:34] can't preach or urge up any authority
[1:07:38] because the weaker vessel i'm just
[1:07:41] telling you what brother brown said
[1:07:43] and you should know that your sisters
[1:07:46] should look at each other and know that
[1:07:48] you lean to emotions
[1:07:50] all the time rather than
[1:07:53] a man that's the head of the house
[1:07:58] and he has to think about all the other
[1:07:59] things okay so that's why
[1:08:01] god told him said now you'll be under
[1:08:04] headship
[1:08:06] listen i love it
[1:08:09] if i was a sister i don't have to be a
[1:08:11] deacon i ain't got to be a preacher
[1:08:15] i won't be like what brother bob said uh
[1:08:17] what sister in the message had to call
[1:08:19] her husband and ask her if she could buy
[1:08:20] a dr pepper or a mountain dew
[1:08:22] now that's a bit silly
[1:08:25] stupid brother dale those downs
[1:08:29] stupid no
[1:08:32] but if you you know what if everybody
[1:08:33] stays in their place it's a wonderful
[1:08:35] picture
[1:08:36] if she if the if that woman which is eve
[1:08:39] remember she wasn't even until after
[1:08:40] that
[1:08:41] that's why the bible says a woman that
[1:08:43] woman if she had stayed in her position
[1:08:45] she would have been just like you and i
[1:08:48] are the bride of christ
[1:08:50] she would have produced christ by
[1:08:53] spiritual seed not by natural seed
[1:08:56] everybody okay with that amen because
[1:08:58] there's no there's no sex involved
[1:09:01] in in the union between christ and the
[1:09:03] bride it's all spoken word
[1:09:05] the spoken word is original seed see how
[1:09:07] clean that is
[1:09:09] it comes from the word of god he's
[1:09:10] standing there and he spoke the word
[1:09:12] and you materialized his seed
[1:09:16] is his word period that's why you
[1:09:19] weren't born with a seed in you of god
[1:09:22] because you weren't born with the word
[1:09:23] of god listen you were born contrary to
[1:09:25] the word yes
[1:09:26] right number one you were born contrary
[1:09:28] to the word because you were born by sex
[1:09:30] but number two you were contrary because
[1:09:32] of the carnal mind
[1:09:34] it's what the bible says the carnal mind
[1:09:36] is enmity there's that enmity
[1:09:38] there's that division between god and
[1:09:41] man
[1:09:42] when what happened in the garden god
[1:09:44] didn't destroy adam and eve we'll read
[1:09:46] it here
[1:09:46] maybe just a few minutes we're not going
[1:09:48] to get to the twins we'll just review a
[1:09:50] little bit
[1:09:50] but when god stood there in genesis 3 15
[1:09:54] he made a promise he said look adam and
[1:09:56] eve i
[1:09:57] cannot fellowship with you like i have
[1:10:00] before
[1:10:01] that's right you've done a bad thing
[1:10:04] i'm not going to kill you
[1:10:07] but i'm going to set in motion what's
[1:10:10] going to bring you back
[1:10:13] amen i'm going to set it in motion
[1:10:15] because he said i'm going to put
[1:10:17] enmity and like brother bob said from
[1:10:20] from abel to john the baptist
[1:10:25] that enmity stayed there inside the soul
[1:10:27] of man
[1:10:29] now we know in the old testament their
[1:10:31] their lives were covered
[1:10:33] by the blood of bulls and ghosts now
[1:10:35] remember covered
[1:10:39] and they will be you might say
[1:10:42] children of god moses elijah even all
[1:10:45] those great but listen folks
[1:10:46] those people were not part of genesis 1
[1:10:49] 26
[1:10:50] that's why that's so special that's an
[1:10:52] eternal part
[1:10:54] moses was not an eternal person while he
[1:10:57] was on earth
[1:11:00] zach black yes
[1:11:04] all of you with the new birth today you
[1:11:06] are an eternal person
[1:11:08] walking in time by the new birth
[1:11:12] because you received an eternal part of
[1:11:14] god that genesis 1 26
[1:11:16] moses never received that
[1:11:19] oh now john the baptist brother wade he
[1:11:21] received the holy ghost
[1:11:22] he wasn't born again because jesus
[1:11:26] told them he said the least in the
[1:11:28] kingdom
[1:11:30] was greater than john the baptist now
[1:11:32] john the baptist received an anointing
[1:11:34] everyone
[1:11:34] listen all the old testament saints they
[1:11:36] received anointings
[1:11:38] to write the word of god the mind of god
[1:11:41] came down dropped down to them but
[1:11:42] listen
[1:11:43] it lifted off and moses could make a
[1:11:45] mistake david could make a mistake
[1:11:47] all these different ones could have
[1:11:49] flaws in the old testament
[1:11:51] but when you come up to the day of
[1:11:52] pentecost
[1:11:55] peter walks out and he says silver and
[1:11:57] gold have i known
[1:11:59] but such as i have
[1:12:02] he couldn't say that when jesus was
[1:12:03] there remember he was scared running he
[1:12:05] was trying to whip people and cut their
[1:12:06] ears off and
[1:12:08] he was trying to take stuff you know
[1:12:10] with a natural sword
[1:12:12] but what happened right after the day of
[1:12:16] pentecost
[1:12:18] peter didn't walk out with a sword he
[1:12:20] walked out with the word
[1:12:23] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:12:26] i have that i got up in that upper room
[1:12:29] i'm fixing to give it to you rise up and
[1:12:32] walk
[1:12:34] he didn't have that before but look at
[1:12:37] the mighty miracles that was in the old
[1:12:38] testament
[1:12:39] many many mighty miracles by people that
[1:12:41] were not
[1:12:42] the children i'm talking about the
[1:12:44] progeny
[1:12:47] you're the progeny of god if you're born
[1:12:51] again today you are the project you have
[1:12:53] a peace of god
[1:12:54] yes inside of you that was that gene
[1:12:57] that chris was talking about wednesday
[1:12:58] that screamed out
[1:13:00] we're gonna be lost but i'm gonna save
[1:13:03] you
[1:13:05] we're gonna be sick but i'm gonna heal
[1:13:07] you
[1:13:09] how wonderful he wasn't talking about a
[1:13:12] separate person he's talking about what
[1:13:13] was groaning inside of god
[1:13:16] what was groaning inside of god was me
[1:13:18] and you
[1:13:19] to be released into this world to show
[1:13:22] the world
[1:13:23] that he could do it and satan hates that
[1:13:26] because he can't do it
[1:13:28] he can anoint anoint anoint anoint annoy
[1:13:30] annoy
[1:13:32] but he can't get inside of that soul
[1:13:34] once you're born again
[1:13:40] talk about a seal see when we see this
[1:13:41] when the seals open
[1:13:43] it reveals christ but where does it
[1:13:44] reveal christ is
[1:13:47] in you that's the whole seal
[1:13:51] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:13:53] whereby ye
[1:13:55] are sealed unto the day of your
[1:13:58] redemption satan can't get there
[1:14:01] he can't open that box car you know why
[1:14:05] because michael's standing at the lock
[1:14:09] and it michael's already whipped him one
[1:14:11] time he can whip him again
[1:14:14] satan knows that he just kind of turns
[1:14:16] and walks off and goes what ghost tried
[1:14:18] to find because remember what did he
[1:14:19] tell
[1:14:20] what did he tell god when he talked
[1:14:22] about job he said where he been satan he
[1:14:23] said i've been up and down
[1:14:24] the earth you know to what you've been
[1:14:26] doing trying
[1:14:28] to get james colley trying to get
[1:14:31] kathy gabriel he's high
[1:14:34] too much man i ain't never felt fire
[1:14:37] like that before
[1:14:39] but he'll find somebody because he'll
[1:14:41] have his subjects
[1:14:44] and that's all right but you and i
[1:14:47] were born by the breath of almighty god
[1:14:51] and satan can't touch that all right
[1:14:54] let's
[1:14:55] now since we answered those questions
[1:14:57] for almost an hour
[1:14:58] but that's good if you got any more
[1:15:00] questions write them down
[1:15:01] because what happened in the garden is
[1:15:03] really important for us to understand
[1:15:06] how god that was part of his plan
[1:15:09] and brother brown said he had a plan and
[1:15:10] a purpose and he wasn't he was going to
[1:15:12] achieve it
[1:15:13] now remember he was going to achieve it
[1:15:15] in the garden of eden if adam
[1:15:16] if eve hadn't done what she did
[1:15:20] but all it done was put enmity because
[1:15:22] remember god didn't come out and say all
[1:15:24] right eve you're destroyed
[1:15:25] adam you're destroyed know what he do he
[1:15:27] said all right adam from this day
[1:15:28] forward
[1:15:30] you're gonna have to
[1:15:33] dictators
[1:15:37] eve you're going to have to be under
[1:15:38] subjection to adam and you're going to
[1:15:40] have his children
[1:15:41] and you're going to be in sorrow and
[1:15:43] childbearing and you're going to have
[1:15:44] your 28 day cycle and you're going that
[1:15:47] that's your fault but he didn't destroy
[1:15:49] him
[1:15:51] he cursed the ground he cursed eve's
[1:15:54] body
[1:15:55] but he couldn't curse your soul
[1:15:58] god can't curse your soul if you're born
[1:16:01] again today
[1:16:03] curse has been dismissed i wish we could
[1:16:06] realize that
[1:16:08] you say no i'm still looking at yeah
[1:16:10] you're looking at part that come
[1:16:11] because of the curse but what about that
[1:16:13] guy inside
[1:16:17] we are not fallen
[1:16:20] man anymore
[1:16:25] it's been reversed the chasm has been
[1:16:28] crossed god in man as brother dale said
[1:16:32] has kissed yes
[1:16:35] but what happened when they reunited
[1:16:40] me and you came when god and man when
[1:16:44] god came down and become a man is when
[1:16:46] he reunited with me and you
[1:16:48] because genesis 3 15 said i'll put
[1:16:49] enmity between thy seed
[1:16:51] and the seed of the woman who was the
[1:16:52] seed of the woman christ
[1:16:54] he bridged the gap back he said
[1:16:57] oh satan you may bruise my heel you
[1:17:00] can't kill somebody by bruising them in
[1:17:02] the hill
[1:17:03] but he said i'll bruise your head
[1:17:07] he give old satan a whack across the
[1:17:09] head when he come out of that tomb and
[1:17:10] said all power in heaven earth's been
[1:17:11] given unto me
[1:17:13] satan was like what where did that come
[1:17:14] from i thought i had him down there in
[1:17:16] that
[1:17:17] other dimension he said now
[1:17:20] he said actually you know what he said i
[1:17:22] own that too said i got the keys
[1:17:26] i got the keys i you don't really own
[1:17:28] anything down there buddy you just stay
[1:17:30] down there with your
[1:17:32] anyway see how god done that for us
[1:17:36] he sent us a prophet to tell us exactly
[1:17:38] what the word he sent us a prophet to
[1:17:39] tell us
[1:17:40] i was thinking the other day you know
[1:17:43] the quote and i can't
[1:17:44] remember all of it where brother brown
[1:17:46] where he goes into the scripture and he
[1:17:47] says
[1:17:48] till he be taken out of the way now
[1:17:52] nowhere in the bible you would think
[1:17:54] well now that especially like
[1:17:56] genesis i mean revelations 10 verse 1
[1:17:59] the mighty angel well you would think
[1:18:01] god would be a capital a and it would be
[1:18:04] this
[1:18:04] he said oh that's christ
[1:18:07] he said so he be taken out of the way
[1:18:09] and he even talks about the bride he
[1:18:12] who letteth will let until he be taken
[1:18:14] out of the way
[1:18:15] no we didn't have a clue with him he's
[1:18:16] were but brother brown brings it right
[1:18:18] in there and tells us exactly and once
[1:18:20] you see it
[1:18:21] you go there ain't no other way it could
[1:18:23] be
[1:18:25] that's why brother brown i believe he
[1:18:26] tapped into that mind of god
[1:18:28] but when he left this earth folks he
[1:18:30] didn't shut it
[1:18:32] because remember it's an open book john
[1:18:35] eat an open book
[1:18:36] and you and i are that open book amen
[1:18:40] so now let's continue with the sermon
[1:18:43] now for another
[1:18:44] we got about six more pages of notes
[1:18:47] but thank you for asking the question if
[1:18:49] you have any more please bring them
[1:18:51] and we'll try to answer them there's
[1:18:54] always a bible answer to everything
[1:18:57] you go in the bible but you have to look
[1:18:59] at the allegories
[1:19:00] and like brother dale told me when i
[1:19:02] first started reading daniel 70 weeks
[1:19:05] he said look he said this is kind of
[1:19:07] like an allegory or
[1:19:09] or this is a story but it has an
[1:19:11] underlying meaning well see the whole
[1:19:13] bible's that way
[1:19:15] when you talk about rahab and you talk
[1:19:18] about her marrying an israeli general
[1:19:21] well you can take that and type it all
[1:19:22] the way over where jesus was talking to
[1:19:24] the woman that
[1:19:25] they threw her down and said this
[1:19:26] woman's been caught in adultery
[1:19:28] well what jesus do he just got rid of
[1:19:30] her accusers
[1:19:32] and he said what have you done she said
[1:19:36] where's your accuser she says i have
[1:19:38] none he said in other words i didn't see
[1:19:39] you do it
[1:19:41] so go and sin no more that's what he did
[1:19:43] with you the new birth
[1:19:45] you throwed all your sins down and once
[1:19:47] he forgive you zach of all your sins
[1:19:49] buddy
[1:19:50] don't lay em back down there again
[1:19:52] you've already laid them down
[1:19:54] god says i didn't see you do them i'm
[1:19:56] looking through the blood i hear you
[1:19:57] crying out to me
[1:19:59] for forgiveness he doesn't see our dirty
[1:20:02] sin he hears our voice
[1:20:06] our voice that says forgive me lord.
[1:20:10] and he instantly does the same things he
[1:20:12] did with rahab and all that he got rid
[1:20:13] of your accusers
[1:20:14] who's your accuser that number spirit
[1:20:17] number
[1:20:18] two he's always going to accuse you of
[1:20:21] everything
[1:20:22] all right let's go to we let's don't go
[1:20:25] to ezekiel let's
[1:20:26] go genesis 1 26 let's read the first
[1:20:28] quote and that's position of the seven
[1:20:29] church ages
[1:20:32] i'll get to the twins sunday
[1:20:36] all right look christ in the true church
[1:20:38] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:20:41] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:20:42] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:20:44] into the church
[1:20:45] and defile it make it lukewarm formal
[1:20:47] and powerless now see that started in
[1:20:48] the first church age
[1:20:50] when paul said grievous wolves will come
[1:20:52] among you and are already here in other
[1:20:54] words
[1:20:56] but look how satan has developed over
[1:20:57] 2000 years since the day of pentecost
[1:20:59] he's had 2 000 years to perfect his game
[1:21:03] god god's plan has already been
[1:21:05] perfected before the foundation of the
[1:21:06] world
[1:21:08] but watch i said it exposes satan
[1:21:10] revealing his work the attempted
[1:21:11] destruction of god's people and
[1:21:12] discrediting of god's word
[1:21:14] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:21:15] the lake of fire he fights that he
[1:21:17] cannot stand it
[1:21:18] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:21:20] revelation
[1:21:21] of the true church and what she is
[1:21:26] she's the bride she's the eve that's
[1:21:29] been restored
[1:21:31] she's perfect she's white
[1:21:35] she's sinless she don't even have a
[1:21:38] wrinkle in her skirt
[1:21:41] i'm just i'm quoting bible amen
[1:21:44] telling you what the bible's already
[1:21:45] said about you
[1:21:47] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:21:48] revelation of the true church
[1:21:50] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:21:53] and that she can do the greater work she
[1:21:55] will be an invincible
[1:21:57] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:21:59] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:22:01] the christian church that's what i'm
[1:22:03] i'm telling you we're reading this every
[1:22:05] time because that spirit is not out
[1:22:07] younger
[1:22:08] it's right here
[1:22:12] but if we can what withstand that
[1:22:15] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:22:18] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:22:20] satan will be powerless before her
[1:22:23] that's why i said a couple of sundays
[1:22:25] ago
[1:22:26] uh and i want to if i don't take any
[1:22:28] more time than this i want to tell you
[1:22:29] one more time
[1:22:30] it will revolutionize revolutionize your
[1:22:34] life
[1:22:35] if you'll get the sin out of your life
[1:22:39] oh i've been in a message 45
[1:22:43] your that attitude is a sin
[1:22:47] amen if we get all that out of our life
[1:22:53] call a brother up if you think you've
[1:22:56] talked about him or don't like him
[1:23:02] sisters
[1:23:05] quit gossiping brothers you do the same
[1:23:08] thing
[1:23:09] i'm just throwing it out there because
[1:23:11] i'm telling you i i'm still
[1:23:13] in my body i got something going on
[1:23:16] but in my soul it is at rest
[1:23:21] because when you clean that baby up
[1:23:25] and you start on the inside let god
[1:23:27] start on the inside
[1:23:30] you know satan's right here so you ain't
[1:23:32] got you don't have to wonder where satan
[1:23:34] is
[1:23:35] sometimes we have to wonder sometimes
[1:23:37] when lord where are you
[1:23:39] brother claude the other night he called
[1:23:40] me and he said he was hurting so bad
[1:23:41] with that gallbladder he said lord where
[1:23:43] are you at i just want to see you just
[1:23:45] for a second
[1:23:46] he was crying like a baby he said please
[1:23:48] take me out of this world
[1:23:50] but you see that he had to get to a
[1:23:51] place to where he said
[1:23:53] be it unto me according to thy word lord
[1:23:56] i'm here for some purpose
[1:23:57] you haven't taken me out of the world i
[1:24:00] may have to
[1:24:00] lose my gallbladder i may have to lose
[1:24:02] my mind but you understand that's the
[1:24:04] same way you and i have to get
[1:24:06] if there's something that's bothering us
[1:24:08] in our life you need to get it out
[1:24:11] you say oh it hurts yeah but boy once
[1:24:14] they take claude's gallbladder
[1:24:16] out in a few months oh it's gonna feel
[1:24:19] so much better
[1:24:21] but as long as that thing's in there
[1:24:22] festering
[1:24:25] telling you it will make you feel
[1:24:28] better on the inside whether you feel
[1:24:30] better on the outside
[1:24:32] that's up to god to help you do that but
[1:24:34] like bob said like brother dale's even
[1:24:36] said before
[1:24:38] this thing is subject to a lot
[1:24:42] it was born in sin it's getting older i
[1:24:44] got pains where i never had pains before
[1:24:48] i got gray hair but what does that
[1:24:51] matter
[1:24:51] if we know where we came from that we
[1:24:54] came from that genesis 1 26 man
[1:24:56] and if you take a picture of me when i
[1:24:57] was 20 years old
[1:25:00] that's what i am to god
[1:25:03] that's what i am to god and that's what
[1:25:05] you'll see
[1:25:06] that's what we'll all see we'll all see
[1:25:08] is not not old anymore i
[1:25:10] i thank god thank god that brother tatum
[1:25:12] don't have to walk in here
[1:25:13] with his if most of you some of you
[1:25:15] didn't see him but he arthritis had
[1:25:17] turned his fingers
[1:25:18] sideways i can't even do it but these
[1:25:20] fingers will turn sideways
[1:25:21] and he couldn't do nothing but just
[1:25:22] barely shake your hand you'll never see
[1:25:24] that again that was because of the fall
[1:25:27] but because the decision he made
[1:25:29] probably 50 or 75 years ago that young
[1:25:32] man is going to come back into this
[1:25:33] dimension
[1:25:34] and he's not going to have nothing to
[1:25:37] worry about
[1:25:38] he can walk in right in the middle of a
[1:25:40] nuclear explosion
[1:25:42] nothing no weapon form
[1:25:48] will destroy you and you will not leave
[1:25:51] this world just like i said before
[1:25:54] if the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:25:55] ordered to the lord you cannot leave
[1:25:57] this world until you're done
[1:25:59] i don't care what it is i don't care if
[1:26:02] god lays you on your back for years
[1:26:04] until your walk is done until your last
[1:26:06] thing you have to do
[1:26:08] is done you're going to be here
[1:26:11] that's why i believe brother branham
[1:26:12] said death don't bother me no more
[1:26:16] look where i'm going and he was only 56
[1:26:20] years old
[1:26:22] and he was ready to go home but you and
[1:26:25] i we get a true revelation
[1:26:28] look at number two the greatest battle
[1:26:29] ever fault the great first battle that
[1:26:31] was ever fought began in heaven
[1:26:32] when michael and his angels fought
[1:26:34] against lucifer and his angels it first
[1:26:36] started the first battle was in heaven
[1:26:38] so sin didn't originate on earth it
[1:26:39] originated in heaven
[1:26:41] so then it was thrown down from earth
[1:26:42] that's why the bible says heaven and
[1:26:43] earth will pass away
[1:26:44] then it was thrown down from heaven cast
[1:26:46] out of heaven it's got to be clean not
[1:26:47] done away with but clean same thing as
[1:26:49] the earth
[1:26:50] and fell on human beings then the battle
[1:26:52] see that's our battle
[1:26:54] the greatest battle ever falls where
[1:26:56] right here
[1:26:57] right here all right an expedition of
[1:27:00] the seven church ages let's continue
[1:27:02] down through let me get to
[1:27:03] one point and then we'll stop an
[1:27:05] exposition i bob went an hour and 40
[1:27:07] minutes i think i can
[1:27:13] y'all started sleeping on me 10 minutes
[1:27:14] after that so did you get it
[1:27:18] there are those twins again it's always
[1:27:20] going to get talked about twins but
[1:27:22] we'll get to it next sunday
[1:27:23] there are those two trees again growing
[1:27:25] side by side
[1:27:27] in the same earth partaking of the same
[1:27:31] nourishment
[1:27:32] drinking in the same rain remember the
[1:27:34] tares and the wheat
[1:27:37] and benefiting by the same sun but they
[1:27:40] come from different seeds
[1:27:44] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[1:27:46] as god give it and
[1:27:48] loves it and obeys it
[1:27:51] the other tree is from the seed that is
[1:27:53] anti the word of god and
[1:27:55] changes it where it wants to
[1:28:01] you know you you talk to people about
[1:28:03] the message and talk about the different
[1:28:05] things in the
[1:28:06] scripture and if you start quoting
[1:28:08] scripture to them
[1:28:09] they'll try to quote you some back right
[1:28:12] because they're going to fight
[1:28:13] they're going to fight if especially if
[1:28:14] it's dress and hair and
[1:28:16] and baptism in them lord jesus christ
[1:28:18] they're going to fight why
[1:28:20] at that time they're from a different
[1:28:21] seed than you are i said at that time
[1:28:23] that doesn't mean that they can't be
[1:28:24] saved
[1:28:26] but see you can't walk away though and
[1:28:28] say well that old serpent seed
[1:28:30] no give it some time
[1:28:33] give it some time let them run it around
[1:28:35] and you know what if they're truly
[1:28:37] part of that genesis 1 26 that mind of
[1:28:39] god god's
[1:28:40] obligated to go get them he's obligated
[1:28:43] to get his children he won't let
[1:28:45] that god will not there won't be a child
[1:28:47] left behind
[1:28:49] of god's children on this earth when we
[1:28:51] take a rapture they won't be one
[1:28:55] he said i got every one of them engraved
[1:28:56] right here in the palm of my hand
[1:28:59] what a surety that we should have
[1:29:03] the other tree is from the seed that is
[1:29:04] anti the word of god and changes it
[1:29:06] where it wants to
[1:29:07] that's why i believe when brother brown
[1:29:09] started preaching this is the exposition
[1:29:10] of the church ages
[1:29:12] and when the seals opened he knew that
[1:29:14] antichrist spirit
[1:29:15] was in those denominations out there
[1:29:20] but remember it come into here now we're
[1:29:23] fighting quotes with quotes
[1:29:26] we're wondering whether brother branham
[1:29:27] was the prophet of the end time
[1:29:29] and i'm not saying we but i'm saying
[1:29:31] there is two
[1:29:32] opposing forces now in the message of
[1:29:36] the hour
[1:29:37] you can't hardly get three or four
[1:29:38] people together without an argument
[1:29:40] beginning
[1:29:41] over what quotes they can quote just as
[1:29:44] much as you can quote
[1:29:46] but i'm telling you the true seed will
[1:29:48] always show its fruit
[1:29:51] by their fruit you will know them
[1:29:55] all right it substitutes its own crease
[1:29:58] in dogmas for the living true word
[1:30:00] exactly as did cain who ended up killing
[1:30:02] abel
[1:30:03] but fear not little flock
[1:30:07] stay with the word keep that word
[1:30:09] between you and the devil
[1:30:11] eve did not do that and she failed
[1:30:14] and when the church lets down on the
[1:30:16] word she goes into the depths of the
[1:30:18] darkness
[1:30:20] of satan
[1:30:23] that's to me that's pretty powerful when
[1:30:26] the church
[1:30:27] lets down on the word she goes into the
[1:30:30] depths
[1:30:31] of the darkness what is the darkness of
[1:30:33] satan oh it's because
[1:30:35] this prostitute drunk and
[1:30:39] the very darkness of satan jesus said
[1:30:41] that light that's in you
[1:30:43] if it be darkness how great is that
[1:30:45] darkness if you think you've got light
[1:30:48] because remember satan is what he's the
[1:30:51] he's light he's changed into an angel of
[1:30:54] light
[1:30:54] ministers of light
[1:30:59] what's the most deception me get up here
[1:31:00] one today and preach that
[1:31:02] that jesus was the second person of the
[1:31:04] trinity
[1:31:06] that's not gonna fool you especially if
[1:31:08] you've known
[1:31:10] what's going on if you've been in the
[1:31:11] message more than two or three weeks
[1:31:14] but what if i bring a doctrine in here
[1:31:16] that's just about that much off
[1:31:19] oh you were already always that's you
[1:31:21] were you were born with an eternal seed
[1:31:23] in you and
[1:31:24] and boy don't that just ma and it does
[1:31:25] it makes people shout and feel good
[1:31:27] makes feel good that you
[1:31:28] listen i believe in eternal security but
[1:31:31] i believe you got to receive it
[1:31:35] and i know you do too but think about
[1:31:37] what's going on in other parts of
[1:31:39] the message world satan is here
[1:31:44] like i said the god of this evil age is
[1:31:46] here to deceive try to deceive us it
[1:31:48] deceives the very elect if it were
[1:31:49] possible
[1:31:51] if you're the very elect then he's got
[1:31:52] his guns trained right on you
[1:31:56] all right now let's go and look
[1:31:59] remember the law of reproduction that's
[1:32:01] what we're talking about because
[1:32:02] remember
[1:32:02] when we get to those two twins the law
[1:32:05] of reproduction has to take over
[1:32:07] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[1:32:10] because the first set of twins that were
[1:32:11] born
[1:32:12] were of two definitely different
[1:32:15] male seeds everybody got that
[1:32:20] cain was the bee seed
[1:32:23] literally literally because the beast
[1:32:27] had an act with eve and
[1:32:28] injected in her and then adam
[1:32:31] had relations and here comes cain and
[1:32:33] abel
[1:32:34] but that's that's the to me that's the
[1:32:37] apex then
[1:32:38] that we look at and we see that jacob
[1:32:40] and esau i mean
[1:32:41] yeah jacob and esau came from what isaac
[1:32:44] and
[1:32:45] rebecca can't get all that right but
[1:32:48] anyway they came from the same mom and
[1:32:50] daddy
[1:32:51] but it was two spirits see then you you
[1:32:53] bring from natural
[1:32:55] see you can't run natural seed lines
[1:32:57] because remember tyro babel
[1:32:58] all these different things the sons of
[1:33:01] men the sons of god saw the daughters of
[1:33:03] men they started intermingling and
[1:33:04] everything got all messed up and
[1:33:05] convoluted and then all of a sudden here
[1:33:07] they come out on the other side of the
[1:33:08] flood
[1:33:10] and you've got ham sham and j-path
[1:33:13] and they repopulated the world so you
[1:33:16] got all that mingled in
[1:33:18] so forget the natural seed line
[1:33:21] forget about it right now we are we are
[1:33:24] we cannot none of you decided
[1:33:28] that you were going to get here
[1:33:31] not a person i'm talking about from bill
[1:33:34] gates
[1:33:35] donald trump i don't care who it is we
[1:33:38] all got here the same way
[1:33:41] and we didn't know who we were before
[1:33:44] but once we get here
[1:33:46] once i grow once i develop and i
[1:33:49] remember
[1:33:50] i grew up in a house of man called
[1:33:51] samuel dale
[1:33:53] and i grew up in the house of a mama
[1:33:55] called peggy dale
[1:33:57] so i hope i'm part of that family
[1:34:01] i am because you know what i look like
[1:34:03] my mom and daddy
[1:34:06] by your fruits you'll be known
[1:34:10] but see if you say well now i don't know
[1:34:11] who my daddy was and some of you may not
[1:34:14] that don't matter it doesn't matter
[1:34:17] god used a man and a woman to get
[1:34:19] together to get you here
[1:34:21] then you got a choice to make i don't
[1:34:23] care your mom and dad is full of the
[1:34:24] baptism of the holy ghost but you sure
[1:34:26] weren't
[1:34:27] right you weren't either you weren't
[1:34:30] either and you weren't either you got to
[1:34:32] make your own choice
[1:34:34] once you come forth out of the womb
[1:34:36] you're a person
[1:34:38] and you got to make a choice well my
[1:34:40] mama and daddy was william brennaman
[1:34:43] and and media i don't mean one thing to
[1:34:46] god
[1:34:47] he does not keep a natural log book but
[1:34:50] he knew that he needed to use
[1:34:52] what a branham a drunk
[1:34:57] quoting brother branham come from a line
[1:34:59] of drunks that fought and
[1:35:01] got died with their boots on
[1:35:05] ignorant but you know god said
[1:35:09] i got to bring them together because
[1:35:11] that's what he looked like
[1:35:15] that genetic makeup has to match what's
[1:35:18] inside because you're going to look just
[1:35:20] like you were at 20 years old you're not
[1:35:21] going to lock somebody else
[1:35:24] so god had to bring um what was the date
[1:35:28] william brandon what was his daddy's
[1:35:29] name
[1:35:31] huh charles and ella
[1:35:35] that's why brother brown one day he says
[1:35:37] he wasn't denied his natural birth he
[1:35:38] said i found out i wasn't the son of
[1:35:40] charles and elephant why
[1:35:43] but remember that was in almost the last
[1:35:46] message that he preached
[1:35:48] in 1965 he figured out and i say figured
[1:35:51] out
[1:35:51] he had a real revelation that that
[1:35:54] wasn't his real mom and daddy
[1:35:57] though he genetically was tied to them
[1:36:01] that genetic part matched what the
[1:36:04] genetic part of that genesis 1 26
[1:36:06] man well i wish y'all could get that
[1:36:10] those sermons that daddy preached about
[1:36:12] 40 of them back in 1995 on matching
[1:36:14] pieces
[1:36:15] about how this had to match this that's
[1:36:17] what we're coming to
[1:36:19] you got to get to a place where you
[1:36:21] match what god saw
[1:36:23] and when you match what god saw that's
[1:36:25] it
[1:36:29] the one just passed on you know what
[1:36:30] they they matched what god saw
[1:36:34] and they couldn't go any further because
[1:36:35] god saw that in his mind
[1:36:38] you say well then we don't have a choice
[1:36:40] yeah you do have a choice
[1:36:43] you have a real choice amen
[1:36:47] sorry you do everything is made by
[1:36:49] choices
[1:36:51] so let's read genesis five verse one the
[1:36:53] law of reproduction sorry
[1:36:55] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:36:56] tree yielding fruit after its kind whose
[1:36:58] seed is in itself
[1:37:00] so we understand the law of reproduction
[1:37:03] is
[1:37:03] that if there is a seed planted in good
[1:37:07] ground
[1:37:07] our womb or wherever you want to say
[1:37:10] it's going to come forth of what that
[1:37:12] seed is genetically made of
[1:37:15] why do you think now we're into this dna
[1:37:17] and genetics and
[1:37:19] my you can even go now and they can test
[1:37:21] you and see if you're susceptible to
[1:37:22] cancer
[1:37:23] or heart attack just by your dna
[1:37:27] why because you're connected to that
[1:37:28] natural line of man
[1:37:30] i say man but mankind you're you're
[1:37:32] directed to that natural
[1:37:34] mankind and they can track oh if they
[1:37:37] can do that
[1:37:40] if they can track naturally where you
[1:37:43] come from
[1:37:45] and what you're susceptible of getting
[1:37:47] or not getting
[1:37:48] why can't we believe that god's already
[1:37:50] protected us knew where we come from
[1:37:53] knew where we were going to be here and
[1:37:54] knew where we were going
[1:37:58] that's the law of reproduction and then
[1:37:59] by your first birth you died
[1:38:05] but by your second birth you died
[1:38:08] i'm sorry by your first birth you will
[1:38:10] die sorry
[1:38:12] by your second birth you died
[1:38:17] so you're dead you're dead to the world
[1:38:21] the bible says dead to the world alive
[1:38:23] in christ
[1:38:24] amen that's what it that to me and see
[1:38:26] that's the whole plan
[1:38:29] when you were born from your mama and
[1:38:31] daddy good parents
[1:38:33] you were born dead because you're going
[1:38:35] to die eventually if you keep going on
[1:38:39] and if you just keep doing what you're
[1:38:40] doing me and you both would have died at
[1:38:42] an early age but god didn't want that he
[1:38:43] preserved
[1:38:44] for some silly reason but anyway so you
[1:38:47] come to that birth
[1:38:48] it doesn't how much your mom and daddy
[1:38:50] loved you and they took care of you
[1:38:51] you come to a place where you had to
[1:38:53] make your own choice
[1:38:55] right here because you know what god
[1:38:58] didn't see them to
[1:39:01] i mean he saw them too but he saw you
[1:39:03] too
[1:39:04] but you didn't realize it until you
[1:39:06] received the new birth and then you can
[1:39:07] connect back to your parents
[1:39:09] or or anybody your uncles aunts whatever
[1:39:11] you want to call it and this is your
[1:39:12] family now
[1:39:15] when you got born again you opened up a
[1:39:16] whole nother family
[1:39:19] have you ever went to a family reunion
[1:39:21] and and
[1:39:22] get born again and go to a family union
[1:39:24] you ever remember that when you go to
[1:39:25] family reunion you go well everything's
[1:39:27] kind of strange around here
[1:39:30] and they're looking at you going what
[1:39:32] happened to you
[1:39:34] where's that long hair where's that beer
[1:39:36] in your hand and a cigarette in your
[1:39:37] mouth
[1:39:37] you understand what i'm saying why
[1:39:40] because you were
[1:39:41] reborn this is my whole point we'll
[1:39:44] close right
[1:39:44] you were reborn by a spiritual seed
[1:39:48] there
[1:39:48] no way your mother and father on this
[1:39:51] earth could ever give you
[1:39:54] but when you're reborn it doesn't do
[1:39:56] away with your first birth
[1:39:57] totally you're still in this shell
[1:40:00] but it turns it to where that same hand
[1:40:04] that used to
[1:40:05] hold the beer and throw them signals up
[1:40:09] that same hand you use to hold that
[1:40:11] microphone
[1:40:12] to sing the praises of god
[1:40:16] and that's what god wanted that's that
[1:40:17] was that's the gap that he's feeling
[1:40:19] back in
[1:40:20] and satan cannot understand that
[1:40:23] how many times when you got born again
[1:40:26] same thing happened to me
[1:40:27] did the devil just leave you alone oh he
[1:40:30] didn't
[1:40:32] you mean he gets caught right there and
[1:40:34] oh brush your heart
[1:40:36] well you did me too buddy because
[1:40:37] brother brown said he takes every gun
[1:40:41] he says all right you used to do what i
[1:40:43] wanted to do now you're not
[1:40:44] what's the problem phil's you full of
[1:40:48] everything he's done every one of us the
[1:40:49] same way
[1:40:50] but he cannot touch that soul by the law
[1:40:52] of reproduction you have changed and
[1:40:54] been transformed
[1:40:57] into the image of god and listen folks
[1:40:59] to me that's all he sees
[1:41:02] that's all god sees he sees you have
[1:41:03] been re-gened
[1:41:06] paul said follow me in the regeneration
[1:41:09] what is regeneration it regenered you
[1:41:15] it gave you that one genesis 1 26 gene
[1:41:19] of eternal life right here
[1:41:23] that is so simple folks but so profound
[1:41:26] that the devil is probably he may not be
[1:41:29] right here he may be right here
[1:41:31] but he can't understand that and i like
[1:41:34] it that way
[1:41:36] if it makes him mad that's okay because
[1:41:39] you know what he can't get you again
[1:41:42] he got you here by deception the first
[1:41:44] time
[1:41:45] and god allowed that to happen because
[1:41:48] of what happened in the garden he didn't
[1:41:50] say now
[1:41:51] hey adam and eve you can't touch each
[1:41:53] other again no he had to still go by
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:56] right there the law of reproduction and
[1:41:59] satan knew that that's why he could get
[1:42:01] into the human race
[1:42:02] he knew that if there was a seed planted
[1:42:04] something had to come out
[1:42:06] and there had to be given life to it
[1:42:09] god had to give life to cain it doesn't
[1:42:12] matter how he was born
[1:42:14] or what happened act was a seed
[1:42:17] went into the bedding ground and god had
[1:42:20] to give it life
[1:42:21] he knew that same way with me and you
[1:42:24] he knew he had to give us life but he
[1:42:27] knew
[1:42:28] on the in that plan and purpose that
[1:42:30] when you match what he saw
[1:42:32] before the foundation of the world it
[1:42:34] changed you back into that genesis 1 26
[1:42:37] man
[1:42:38] oh it didn't make us younger except on
[1:42:40] the inside
[1:42:42] it gave you eternal life by the law
[1:42:46] of reproduction every seed
[1:42:50] must bring forth of its kind
[1:42:53] you love the lord we'll put this off and
[1:42:56] we'll start right there on sunday if
[1:42:57] you'll stand to your feet musicians come
[1:43:04] remember everything musicians come up
[1:43:07] everything started in the book of
[1:43:09] genesis so if you want to look back and
[1:43:11] see
[1:43:12] i can see do you know i can see where i
[1:43:14] started in my natural birth in the book
[1:43:16] of genesis
[1:43:16] and i can see where i started my
[1:43:18] spiritual birth because my spiritual
[1:43:20] birth came first
[1:43:21] in the mind of god genesis 1 26 let us
[1:43:24] make man our own image when he said that
[1:43:26] it couldn't be taken away from
[1:43:29] but god was projecting it down and then
[1:43:31] here comes adam in a body of flesh
[1:43:34] and then takes out even a body of flesh
[1:43:36] to reproduce adam because she was
[1:43:38] woman man with the womb
[1:43:42] but where was mary's womb involved men's
[1:43:45] natural
[1:43:46] womb was not involved until her
[1:43:48] spiritual wound
[1:43:50] was contacted first same way with eve
[1:43:54] satan knew if he could get eve to listen
[1:43:56] to what he said listen
[1:43:58] to what he said that he
[1:44:02] by her emotion would do
[1:44:06] exactly what she did and god knew it too
[1:44:08] but he couldn't stop her because he
[1:44:10] she wouldn't be a female agent amen
[1:44:14] listen god don't stop you from doing
[1:44:16] things he puts the word in front of you
[1:44:19] he puts the word in front of you and
[1:44:20] then what'd brother brown say
[1:44:22] so you gotta walk over calvary to get to
[1:44:25] hell
[1:44:26] crawl over calvary to get to hell so you
[1:44:29] and
[1:44:29] and think about that every person that
[1:44:32] comes to the white throne judgment he'll
[1:44:34] tell them the day
[1:44:35] the hour i came to you and you turned me
[1:44:38] down
[1:44:39] so therefore you go that way but oh what
[1:44:43] about
[1:44:43] that time though when you receive the
[1:44:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:48] you didn't just receive the new birth
[1:44:50] you received the judge
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:55] because the saints will judge
[1:44:59] angels the saints will judge the world
[1:45:03] and when you look in revelations 21 or 2
[1:45:06] it says that there we were
[1:45:10] and the books were open and we were all
[1:45:13] standing there and
[1:45:16] everybody was judged out of that book
[1:45:18] you and i
[1:45:19] we're not judged out of that book
[1:45:22] we are the book we are the book
[1:45:26] the eternal section that nobody can
[1:45:29] touch
[1:45:30] you you listen if you're born again
[1:45:32] you're not foolish virgin
[1:45:34] you're not a cup of water in my name
[1:45:36] you're not you already have eternal life
[1:45:40] and that seed remains in you and you
[1:45:42] cannot sin why
[1:45:43] god can't make go god can't make you sin
[1:45:50] brother brother said if we sin we sin on
[1:45:52] our own
[1:45:54] he said we have to go out to the devil
[1:45:58] if we're going to sin right let's stay
[1:46:01] behind the word of god
[1:46:03] but that law of reproduction i want you
[1:46:05] to think about that
[1:46:06] we have been regenerated and regenered
[1:46:08] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:46:10] you are a different person you're a new
[1:46:12] creature i'm quoting scripture
[1:46:15] you're a new creation in christ old
[1:46:17] things have passed away behold
[1:46:18] all things have become new we're sitting
[1:46:22] in heavenly places do you know that soul
[1:46:23] that you got is not sitting in this
[1:46:25] world
[1:46:30] it's just caught by what's on the
[1:46:32] outside because of the law of
[1:46:34] reproduction
[1:46:35] your mom and daddy got you here and then
[1:46:37] god come down one day and said hey
[1:46:40] you're a part of my family
[1:46:44] i want you to be a part of my family no
[1:46:47] he didn't say that
[1:46:48] he said you are a part of my family
[1:46:51] he said i just want you to realize that
[1:46:54] and then what do you do you say
[1:46:55] what brother brown said papa god
[1:46:58] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:47:03] nothing involved but the womb of your
[1:47:04] mind accepting
[1:47:06] the seed word of god this is the only
[1:47:09] seed god's got he don't have natural
[1:47:10] seed
[1:47:12] he has he's a spiritual seed the spoken
[1:47:14] word is the original seed
[1:47:15] please get that in in you and you'll
[1:47:18] understand
[1:47:19] what what we're doing we're trying to
[1:47:21] understand where we came from
[1:47:25] because ask a person on the street
[1:47:28] i'm sorry ask a person on the street
[1:47:30] where'd you come from
[1:47:31] they're going to save my mom and daddy
[1:47:34] you're saying no where did your life
[1:47:35] come from
[1:47:36] your life didn't come from your mom and
[1:47:38] daddy your mama produced that you dated
[1:47:39] produced the
[1:47:40] the uh sperm and your mama produced the
[1:47:43] egg and you had a body that came here
[1:47:45] but
[1:47:45] where'd your life come from oh it just
[1:47:48] it just somehow it
[1:47:50] now come on but you and i
[1:47:56] you and i somebody i wish somebody would
[1:47:58] ask me that question
[1:48:01] i'd take them back to genesis 1 26. and
[1:48:04] i'd say
[1:48:04] right there is where i came from
[1:48:09] that's why i'm doing here and that's
[1:48:11] where i'm going back to
[1:48:13] we're the only people that know that
[1:48:14] nobody in this world they've walked
[1:48:16] through this world just oblivious to
[1:48:17] where they came from or even where
[1:48:18] they're going
[1:48:20] but you and i don't because we have a
[1:48:21] purpose we are the true church
[1:48:23] that understands what we're doing here
[1:48:25] when we do that
[1:48:26] we'll be an invincible army let's sing a
[1:48:29] song god bless you

[1:51:08] that's why i'm happy
[1:51:09] tonight oh listen folks i'm telling you
[1:51:11] this the world has given us a pressure
[1:51:15] but god told us that we could take this
[1:51:17] pressure
[1:51:18] he told us we were built for this we
[1:51:21] were
[1:51:21] astronauts we were built for the
[1:51:23] pressure of the day
[1:51:25] and satan is a liar
[1:51:29] he can't tell the truth he can twist it
[1:51:34] but what's going on in the world today
[1:51:39] take it positive because it's moving us
[1:51:41] to get out of here
[1:51:43] amen and i was thinking you know when
[1:51:46] they said about brother dale on
[1:51:48] different ones
[1:51:49] well if you know you go ahead and have
[1:51:50] the thing get it over with
[1:51:53] ain't going to happen no more and he's
[1:51:56] fine there's
[1:51:56] no problem everything's good same way
[1:52:00] with all the other brothers and sisters
[1:52:01] everything's good
[1:52:03] just things that we have to go through
[1:52:04] because we do still live under the curse
[1:52:07] but greater is he that's in us than he
[1:52:09] that's in the world
[1:52:10] so we pray that the overcoming power of
[1:52:12] god will take over
[1:52:14] and that we'll walk in the light of the
[1:52:16] world and of the word of god
[1:52:19] and feast on the manna because look
[1:52:25] what else is left what else have we got
[1:52:29] we can't depend on the government we
[1:52:31] can't depend on our doctor
[1:52:32] we can't depend on the hospital we can't
[1:52:34] depend on the health care system we
[1:52:36] can't depend on the economy
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] who are we going to depend on brother
[1:52:42] um darny for all your life
[1:52:46] you've depended on god so we just need
[1:52:49] to keep dependent on god
[1:52:52] depend on him he's the one that gives
[1:52:55] life
[1:52:56] he's the one to give you breath and he's
[1:52:59] the one that's going to sustain you
[1:53:00] until your walk's done
[1:53:03] and we're praying that our walk will
[1:53:05] walk us right out of here
[1:53:06] and that we don't have to go by the
[1:53:08] grave if we don't go by the grave guess
[1:53:09] what
[1:53:10] we have overcome everything there's not
[1:53:13] a disease that's going to bother us
[1:53:15] there's not a coronavirus strong enough
[1:53:19] unless god's finished with us
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] and i don't believe god's finished with
[1:53:24] brother dale i don't believe he's
[1:53:25] finished with none of us
[1:53:27] amen because we have a purpose for being
[1:53:30] here
[1:53:32] i believe we all do everybody you have a
[1:53:35] purpose you
[1:53:35] everybody has a purpose in this building
[1:53:40] to do what
[1:53:43] proclaim the fruit

[1:53:49] your new birth
