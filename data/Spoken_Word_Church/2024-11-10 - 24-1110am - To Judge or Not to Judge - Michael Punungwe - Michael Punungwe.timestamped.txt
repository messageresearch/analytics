[0:00] amen good morning
[0:02] Saints it's happy to be in the house of
[0:04] the Lord if you have your Bibles let's
[0:07] turn to James
[0:11] 4 amen just enter into that Sabbath rest
[0:15] when you come in the house of the
[0:16] Lord and whatsoever things are of good
[0:19] report
[0:34] amen we could just bow our heads dear
[0:37] father Lord we thank you for this day
[0:38] thank you for allowing your people to
[0:40] gather here Lord just pray that whatever
[0:41] said Lord would be for the edification
[0:43] of the Saints Lord just to embolden us
[0:46] Lord in your spirit Lord just to give us
[0:47] guidance as we walk here on this Earth
[0:49] Lord and get ready for your coming just
[0:51] pray for those who wen't able to make it
[0:53] Lord and pray for forgive us of all our
[0:55] sins Lord and just get ourselves out the
[0:56] way just to focus on you this morning
[0:58] just lead us and guide us in all things
[0:59] Lord in your PR name of Jesus Christ I
[1:01] pray
[1:03] amen amen James
[1:06] 4:1 from Once come Wars and fightings
[1:09] among you come they not hence even of
[1:12] your own lusts that war in your
[1:14] members so we see this is the
[1:18] James's we know this is the state of the
[1:20] world
[1:22] where these fightings and wars that come
[1:25] from our lust our desires these wrongful
[1:28] desires and people are the reason people
[1:30] have so much trouble getting together is
[1:32] that they're they're too focused on
[1:33] themselves it's a selfish Spirit but
[1:35] James is even talking to the Christians
[1:37] in the church not just the world he's
[1:38] talking to the church saying why why are
[1:41] we even having these conflicts in the
[1:42] church you we're supposed to be set
[1:43] apart from the world you know we know
[1:45] that church is a a called out group as
[1:47] brother brandham says so why are there
[1:48] fightings even amongst the church and it
[1:50] comes from our lust our own selfish
[1:53] desires and uh something brother Ryan's
[1:55] really good at pointing out G does a
[1:57] great job in his uh love lesson series
[2:00] but he really talks about
[2:02] um how how he really points out how
[2:05] marriage is a a a service it's it's a
[2:07] selfless Endeavor you know and if you
[2:09] can't you can't have selfish people in a
[2:11] marriage because then you're going to
[2:13] butt heads all the time but you really
[2:15] you should be trying to give and give
[2:16] and give and then you're both looking
[2:18] out for each other and that's how it
[2:19] works but if one even one of you is
[2:20] selfish you know it's going to mess
[2:23] things up but if we can all be selfless
[2:24] if we can all look out for our brother
[2:26] and sister and look out for the other
[2:28] person you know then then that's going
[2:30] to create Harmony in the church even
[2:31] brother brandom said that your first
[2:33] love is is really Your Love First Love
[2:35] first and foremost priority should be
[2:37] God then it's your fellow man and then
[2:39] yourself so that's the order and we
[2:41] always need to remember that order so
[2:43] there won't be fightings and Wars among
[2:45] us as James is talking about in verse
[2:48] two ye lust and have not you kill and
[2:51] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[2:54] fight in war yet you have not because
[2:57] you ask not so even with with our our
[3:00] selfish desires even with and all the
[3:03] work that we put into doing these things
[3:04] and he's saying that people are killing
[3:06] and people are are are are doing going
[3:08] to Great Lengths to obtain what they
[3:10] want but they still are not obtaining
[3:12] what they want and no matter how much
[3:14] you try to pursue something you know if
[3:17] God's not behind it you're going to be
[3:18] left feeling empty so but but you the
[3:20] reason you have not is because you ask
[3:22] not and you ask a miss so those those
[3:25] are the reasons that you have not is
[3:26] because you're first of all you're not
[3:28] you're not going to the right source but
[3:30] also when you ask you're asking a Miss
[3:32] you're asking to uh consume it upon your
[3:34] lust as it says in verse three you ask
[3:37] and receive not because you ask a miss
[3:39] that you may consume it upon your lust
[3:41] so even when you do ask there is a
[3:44] there's a way that you should have you
[3:45] should ask and and as the scripture says
[3:48] you know we're it's it's it's the idea
[3:51] of our lust and and and it's and it's
[3:52] our own personal desires our own
[3:54] personal what we want out of life what
[3:56] we want out of a conversation what we
[3:58] want out of something and if those
[4:00] desires don't align with God's desires
[4:03] there's going to be a lot of
[4:04] turmoil but we have to overcome those
[4:06] desires on oursel to be perfected and
[4:09] it'll it'll even be better for ourselves
[4:11] but also for our brothers and sisters in
[4:13] the church and and if you fail to do
[4:16] those things you're going to start
[4:17] asking God for things that are selfish
[4:18] and lustful
[4:20] and what we must do is conform our
[4:23] desire to God's desire and that's why
[4:25] Jesus prayed you know not my will but
[4:27] thy will be done and it's an example of
[4:29] of dismissing our own will and lust and
[4:32] submitting yourself to God no matter the
[4:34] sacrifice you know whether you want
[4:36] money or a new car and and God may not
[4:38] give you those things because you you
[4:39] probably don't need them you know we
[4:40] live in a uh we're we're blessed to live
[4:44] in a very rich country and there's many
[4:46] things that we don't really need but we
[4:47] might want certain things and God's not
[4:49] going to give you according to your
[4:50] wants all the time you might you might
[4:52] want uh a new car you might oh I have a
[4:54] nice car but Lord uh can I get it in red
[4:57] like no that's not that shouldn't be I
[4:59] desire that's that's asking a
[5:02] Miss that's asking a Miss is that you
[5:04] don't need that new car in red you don't
[5:05] need uh leather seats or whatever your
[5:08] preference may be but but sometimes God
[5:10] gives according to your want your needs
[5:12] and not your wants so sometimes when you
[5:14] ask something think do I really need
[5:15] this or is this just something that you
[5:17] know there's a there's a culture of
[5:18] consumerism here in America where you
[5:21] whatever the new thing is you got to get
[5:22] you got to get it it's on sale it's on
[5:24] sale it's on sale now it's not going to
[5:26] be on sale next week but it'll be on
[5:27] sale the whole year so it's just it's
[5:30] that that consumerism and trying to get
[5:32] you to get stuff all the time and and
[5:34] sometimes you get more focused on those
[5:35] things but when someone's in need you
[5:37] see how God shows up you you can see the
[5:40] the testimonies of Believers when they
[5:41] said they had a need and a desire and
[5:43] there was something they really needed
[5:44] and God showed up for them you know
[5:46] maybe they needed someone to go to and a
[5:49] brother or sister just called them and
[5:50] that was something they needed in that
[5:51] moment just a talk or a conversation or
[5:54] or a question to be to be asked and
[5:56] answered across the pulpit so those
[5:58] different things are the things that we
[6:00] should ask for ask for Revelation ask
[6:01] for a a healing we know that in the word
[6:04] God wants you to be healed he died for
[6:06] that he took those stripes to to to
[6:09] forgive you of your sins and cleanse you
[6:10] of those things to heal you of those you
[6:12] know those those those diseases and all
[6:15] those different things you may go
[6:16] through God wants to heal you so we know
[6:17] that by those desires that we cannot ask
[6:19] a miss and we're asking for healing
[6:21] because we know God wants to heal us God
[6:22] wants to see us uh in a better place and
[6:25] healed so those those are the things
[6:27] that he came and died for that's why he
[6:29] set activity captive so we know he wants
[6:31] us to be healed and so not not not that
[6:34] we ask things to fulfill our lustful
[6:36] desires but we ask things according to
[6:39] his
[6:40] will uh verse
[6:42] seven submit yourselves therefore to God
[6:45] resist the devil and he will flee from
[6:48] you now resisting the devil requires
[6:51] submission to God you cannot resist the
[6:54] devil on your own merits know because
[6:56] there's no salvation in that but as it
[6:58] says uh in ation you must walk in the
[7:01] spirit to overcome the flesh that's how
[7:03] you resist the flesh so it's not just
[7:09] um it's not
[7:12] just you resisting but but your
[7:15] resistance is submission because there's
[7:17] only two Spirits as we know there's only
[7:19] two Spirits you can go to there there's
[7:21] you can submit to God or you can live
[7:23] how you want which is really what the
[7:24] devil wants you to do is live how you
[7:26] want live according to your own desires
[7:28] and not according to the moral
[7:30] principles laid out in the Bible so that
[7:32] that's what you need to submit yourself
[7:34] to and that's how you resist the devil
[7:35] you don't just resist the devil by
[7:36] saying I'm not going to do that or I
[7:39] just really don't want to and I'm going
[7:40] to get on this 30-day you know program
[7:42] or whatever it is but really you you
[7:44] resist the devil by submitting yourself
[7:46] to God you know you you resist those
[7:48] evil spirits by opening your Bible or
[7:50] listening to a tape or getting in the
[7:51] word reading reading a book that's how
[7:53] you resist the devil it's not just well
[7:55] I'm going to think really hard and try
[7:57] really hard not to do this but it's
[7:58] really you need to you need to surround
[8:00] yourself more so with good things it's
[8:02] not just get away from the bad things
[8:04] but you get away from the bad things by
[8:06] moving towards the good things you know
[8:09] that's why in verse eight he says draw
[8:10] nigh to God and He will draw nigh unto
[8:13] you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and
[8:16] purify your hearts ye
[8:19] double-minded now that's an interesting
[8:21] uh I guess metaphor expression he uses
[8:24] there to say cleanse your hands ye
[8:25] Sinners and and and the and and purify
[8:28] your hearts you double minded so there
[8:30] there's a prescription there for uh
[8:32] perhaps two conditions that are one and
[8:36] the same but also a there there's some
[8:38] differentiation between them so cleanse
[8:40] your hands you Sinners hands are a
[8:41] represent representation of your actions
[8:43] and the things that you do everything
[8:45] you do with your hands you know I'm
[8:46] talking with my hands we drive with our
[8:48] hands we we we shake hands we everything
[8:50] we do we're writing down we're typing up
[8:53] you know if we work with our hands if
[8:54] we're plumbers if we're if we're in an
[8:57] office no matter what we're doing we're
[8:58] doing with our hands so everything that
[8:59] we do that's what the hands are the
[9:01] hands are our actions are our life the
[9:03] the the works that we do so that's what
[9:06] our hands are so if you're sinning if
[9:07] you're a sinner you need to clean your
[9:08] hands clean up your actions clean up
[9:10] your life clean up the way you talk to
[9:12] people the way you operate at work the
[9:14] way the way you you know handled uh
[9:16] disagreements or disputes with your
[9:17] brother or sister th those are your
[9:19] actions and then your whole life should
[9:21] be changed by that and then it says uh
[9:25] purify your hearts you double- minded
[9:26] now the heart is a um
[9:30] perhaps a more delicate matter but the
[9:33] heart is is that that's truly what your
[9:35] desires are your hands are your actions
[9:37] but your hearts are your desires so so
[9:39] you may be able to clean up uh maybe
[9:42] your actions but your if if your heart
[9:44] isn't clean you know you're still going
[9:46] to struggle to to to live these live
[9:48] live the right life because you're still
[9:49] kind of fighting in between your desires
[9:52] and those different things so both your
[9:54] desires and your actions have to line up
[9:56] that's why Paul even talks about a lot
[9:57] about you know how he he his desires are
[10:00] one way but his actions are another way
[10:01] and he's trying to fix that and he's
[10:03] trying to you know get through that as
[10:04] as a human being but we need to be make
[10:07] sure that we clean up both of those
[10:08] things so that they match up you know
[10:10] our desires might be in the right place
[10:12] but if our actions are in the wrong
[10:13] place then then as brother brandom said
[10:15] we have a we have a heart issue said
[10:17] when someone is not living right or not
[10:19] doing right according to the scriptures
[10:20] it's really a heart issue it's an issue
[10:22] of the heart and and someone needs to be
[10:24] converted so then that they'll be
[10:26] committed to the to or get a new birth
[10:29] experience and be committed to the word
[10:31] and be committed to those
[10:32] things in verse 9 be afflicted and mourn
[10:36] and weep and let your laughter be turned
[10:39] to mourning and your joy to heaviness
[10:41] now we we know earlier that we've talked
[10:43] about uh how how Jesus wants us to be
[10:45] healed he wants us to be in a better
[10:47] place you know we know the scriptures
[10:48] like uh we need peace that passes
[10:50] understanding but but here James is
[10:52] saying actually no be afflicted and
[10:53] mourn and weep and your laughter should
[10:56] be turned to mourning and your joy
[10:57] should be heavy you shouldn't be happy
[10:59] so
[10:59] and he he's not and and it's just kind
[11:02] of a strange thing to almost kind of
[11:04] wish that upon someone but he he he's
[11:06] saying this because he he's addressing
[11:08] he's addressing The Sinner and he's
[11:10] addressing
[11:12] uh he's he's he's addressing that sinful
[11:14] nature and he's saying know if your life
[11:16] if you're not living right your uh your
[11:18] life also shouldn't just you know be
[11:21] okay he he wants you to suffer through
[11:22] those things and part of that is is
[11:24] what's read in verse 10 in verse 10 says
[11:26] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[11:27] Lord and He Shall lift you up so
[11:30] sometimes God will allow hardships to
[11:32] come upon you to Humble you even in the
[11:34] Bible there are situations like uh
[11:36] Samson and David where God you know
[11:38] blessed them and but then they start to
[11:40] become prideful they start to take they
[11:42] have to start to take credit for for you
[11:43] know what what God has done in their
[11:45] life and then they get to these
[11:46] positions and they start doing things
[11:47] that they shouldn't be doing and that's
[11:49] why you know Samuel has to come and
[11:50] correct David and Samson has to pay you
[11:52] know a price for for his arrogance
[11:54] getting out out of control and trusting
[11:56] the wrong people and string off of you
[11:59] know you know what God called him to do
[12:01] so so when these things are James is
[12:02] really wishing Affliction on these
[12:04] people so that they they would humble
[12:05] themselves and that the Lord can lift
[12:07] them up you know but but sometimes God
[12:09] will send those afflictions to Humble
[12:11] you and there's many many testimonies
[12:13] where Believers will say oh well I
[12:14] wasn't living right and I just thought
[12:16] everything was okay and then something
[12:17] happened in their life something really
[12:19] struck them something something that was
[12:21] really dear to their heart you know in
[12:22] event something happened where where
[12:24] they had to turn to God and they got so
[12:26] desperate that they had nowhere else to
[12:28] turn so so God will put those things in
[12:30] your life to to Humble you so that you
[12:32] know cuz when you're when you're on top
[12:34] and when you think everything's good and
[12:35] it's very easy to do that especially and
[12:37] say in America or in other First World
[12:39] countries where there's a lot of uh
[12:41] prosperity it's very easy to feel like
[12:43] well your life is okay and you don't
[12:45] need God and and what's the point of
[12:47] that but but when something happens in
[12:49] your life and it brings you to a point
[12:50] of desperation you know and you get
[12:52] desperate enough that you'll seek out
[12:53] anything you know you James is is saying
[12:56] that you should seek out the Lord in
[12:57] those moments you know you should when
[12:59] you're Afflicted when your joy does turn
[13:00] to heaviness that's when you humble
[13:02] yourself before the Lord and then he
[13:03] lifts you up as the scripture says in
[13:06] verse
[13:08] 11 speak not evil of one another
[13:11] Brethren he that speaketh evil of his
[13:13] brother and judgeth judgeth his brother
[13:16] speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the
[13:19] law but if thou judge the law Thou Art
[13:22] not a doer of the law but a
[13:25] judge so why why was it someone that
[13:28] someone who
[13:29] why is it that someone who judges their
[13:31] brother or sister also speaks evil of
[13:33] the law because we know that Paul said
[13:36] in Corinthians that we we we need
[13:38] discernment we need to be able to judge
[13:39] things and we need to
[13:41] um we we we're going to be have to judge
[13:43] angels and and judge you know much
[13:45] higher things so we should be able to
[13:47] judge these lower things and that we
[13:48] that's why we shouldn't take our
[13:49] brothers and sisters to court because we
[13:51] should be able to to figure that out
[13:53] ourselves because we both have uh you
[13:55] know if we if we're both rooted in the
[13:56] scriptures and rooted in in Christ we
[13:58] should be able to to settle disputes
[14:00] among us in the church and not have to
[14:02] take it to a a federal or state level or
[14:05] whatever the case may
[14:06] be but then so so so Paul is saying that
[14:10] we need to be capable of judging and
[14:12] James is kind of saying that we
[14:14] shouldn't judge our brothers and sisters
[14:15] and actually when we judge we speak evil
[14:17] of the law so so what what is going on
[14:20] here do uh Paul and Paul and James need
[14:22] to have a ministers meeting or what what
[14:25] do we need to do what what is the uh
[14:27] reconciliation of the scriptures
[14:30] but if we read verse 12 it'll it'll be
[14:32] seen more clearly as it says there is
[14:35] one lawgiver who is able to save and to
[14:37] destroy who art thou that judgest
[14:40] another so so the issue here of judging
[14:43] the law is it's not that it's not the
[14:45] Judgment itself but it's rather the
[14:47] standard by which someone is judged so
[14:50] as James said there's one lawgiver and
[14:51] if you're judging someone based on your
[14:53] own standards you know that's wrong
[14:55] because the only correct standard to
[14:57] judge by is the Bible and God's word
[14:59] word you know and and we might look
[15:00] around and we might have disagreements
[15:02] and we might think that certain people
[15:04] should act a certain way or we might
[15:05] think that uh some people you know there
[15:07] might be uh preferences like oh maybe
[15:10] someone's not dressed nice enough or if
[15:12] you don't come to church dressed a
[15:14] certain way or or if you don't do things
[15:16] this way or the Pio needs to be played
[15:17] this way or the drums or or whatever the
[15:19] case may be or
[15:20] maybe know just different things that
[15:22] that that come between the brothers and
[15:24] sisters or just different judgments or
[15:27] how people handle things in their own
[15:28] life and their how they handle things
[15:29] with their family or maybe how they
[15:31] speak and and different things where we
[15:33] judge and we we have our own judgments
[15:35] and our own beliefs about how things
[15:36] should be done but all those things need
[15:37] to be brought back to a scriptural basis
[15:40] and that's why if we speak evil of each
[15:41] other we speak evil of the law because
[15:42] now we have made ourselves the lawgiver
[15:45] in that sense if there's if there's not
[15:46] a Biblical standard for it we have now
[15:49] superseded the biblical law with our own
[15:51] law in our own judgments that's why
[15:53] we've made ourselves uh We've made
[15:55] ourselves judge in that sense and that's
[15:58] not what we're to do we're suppos to
[15:59] judge by a Biblical standard so it's not
[16:01] the Judgment itself but it is the
[16:03] standard by which you judge and if the
[16:05] standard is your own standard then you
[16:06] have spoke evil of the law by putting
[16:08] your own law in there where it should
[16:10] not
[16:11] be and let's turn to Matthew chapter 7
[16:14] if you have your
[16:27] Bibles Matthew 7 7
[16:34] vers1 but even if there is a Biblical
[16:37] standard there is a way to that it even
[16:41] if there you are judging by biblical
[16:42] standard there's still there's still
[16:44] guidance for how you should judge even
[16:46] then so verse one says judge not that ye
[16:49] be not
[16:51] judged for with what judgment you judge
[16:54] ye shall be judged and with what measure
[16:56] you meet it shall be measured to to you
[16:59] again so even when you do judge I think
[17:03] the core of the scripture here is that
[17:04] you have to leave room for Mercy CU When
[17:07] when God judges there's room for Mercy
[17:09] because if we were to judge all of us by
[17:10] biblical standard no one's making it so
[17:13] we there has to be room for Mercy there
[17:14] has to be room for grace and even if you
[17:17] can point out something a brother or
[17:18] sister did and and it and it is in line
[17:21] with the scriptures you must also allow
[17:23] for Grace because that if you if you
[17:25] don't allow for grace that same measure
[17:27] will be brought upon you right we know
[17:29] that Christ in the in the law and he
[17:31] came to sacrifice himself and all those
[17:32] things so that there could be grace for
[17:35] us so when you judge by biblical
[17:37] standard you must leave room for grace
[17:40] even if you are correct you cannot be
[17:42] you not cannot let allow yourself to
[17:44] become arrogant or or high- minded but
[17:46] you must allow for the the same Grace
[17:48] that Christ allows for all of
[17:50] us and even if you maybe decide to
[17:55] uh uh what would I say like like full
[17:58] ful lay down the law on someone you know
[18:02] remember that that standard will be
[18:03] brought back upon
[18:05] you and verse three and why beholdest
[18:09] thou the moat that is in thy brother's
[18:11] eye but considerest not the beam that is
[18:13] in thy own eye or how Willl thou say to
[18:16] thy brother let me pull out the moat out
[18:18] of thine eye and behold a beam is in
[18:20] thine eye thou hypocrite First cast out
[18:24] the beam out of thine own eye then shalt
[18:26] thou See Clearly to cast out the moat
[18:29] out of thy brother's
[18:31] eye so part of that is is once you
[18:34] become too critical you end up becoming
[18:37] hypocritical because there's there's
[18:39] there's things in your own life that you
[18:41] need to confront first you know before
[18:42] you judge your brother you know you need
[18:44] to look what's in your own eye and get
[18:46] and get your own problems out the way so
[18:49] those standards will be imposed upon you
[18:50] and that's why you have to leave room
[18:51] for mercy and you have to make sure that
[18:53] you're also living righteously or or
[18:55] else your judgment really is misplaced
[18:57] and you need to First judge yourself
[18:59] by that standard before you judge your
[19:00] brother or
[19:01] sister so don't don't be so critical
[19:04] that you become
[19:05] hypocritical let's go back to uh James
[19:32] verse
[19:33] 13 James
[19:37] 4:13 go to now ye that
[19:41] say today or tomorrow we will go into
[19:44] such a city and continue there a year
[19:47] and buy and sell and get gain whereas
[19:50] you know not what shall be on the
[19:52] tomorrow for what is your life it is
[19:54] even a vapor that appear for a little
[19:56] time and then vanisheth away
[19:59] for that you ought to say if the Lord
[20:02] will we shall live and do this or that
[20:05] but now you rejoice in your boastings
[20:08] all such rejoicing is
[20:10] evil therefore to him that knoweth to do
[20:13] good and doeth it not to him it is
[20:16] sin so that that's part of touching on
[20:19] uh that's why we say Lord willing
[20:21] because we know we don't know what's
[20:23] going to happen tomorrow we don't know
[20:24] what the future holds and we we don't
[20:26] know those things so we shouldn't speak
[20:28] so uh I guess confidently or or or
[20:31] solidly as as if we we have we have the
[20:33] answers you know and it's the same with
[20:35] judgment we can't we can't even judge
[20:36] what's going to happen tomorrow how are
[20:38] we going to judge our brothers and
[20:39] sisters and these things you know
[20:41] without without a standard you know
[20:43] without by making up our own standard we
[20:45] can't do that we have to judge by God's
[20:46] standard because even our life is a
[20:48] vapor we don't even know we don't know
[20:50] what could happen the next five minutes
[20:52] so there's nothing there's no standard
[20:54] there's nothing that we have within
[20:56] ourselves that that is worthy to bestow
[20:59] judgment and without the guidance of the
[21:01] Holy Spirit without the guidance of the
[21:02] Bible and without the scriptures and
[21:04] without all of these things so God bless
[21:06] you you're dismissed
[21:08] [Applause]
