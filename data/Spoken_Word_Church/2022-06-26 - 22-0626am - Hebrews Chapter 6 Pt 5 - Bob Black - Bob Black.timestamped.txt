[1:21] we ask your blessing now in your name
[1:23] amen
[1:25] so hebrews chapter six verses four to
[1:27] six if you maybe just follow along in
[1:29] your bible this morning we're just gonna
[1:30] um
[1:31] try making our way to hebrews chapter
[1:33] seven where paul begins to talk about
[1:35] melchizedek
[1:36] and um
[1:38] you know a lot of the things paul says
[1:40] is is like peter would say a little bit
[1:42] difficult to understand but really the
[1:44] theme of of chapter six is is um
[1:47] he he is you need to be pointing it
[1:50] and he's so he's saying in verse four he
[1:52] says for it is impossible for those who
[1:54] were once enlightened and have tasted of
[1:56] the heavenly gift and were made
[1:57] partakers of the holy ghost and have
[1:59] tasted the good word of god and the
[2:00] powers of the world to come
[2:02] if they shall fall away to renew them
[2:04] again unto repentance
[2:06] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[2:08] son of god afresh and put him to an open
[2:10] shame
[2:11] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[2:13] that cometh oft upon it and bringeth
[2:15] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[2:17] dressed receiveth blessing from god but
[2:19] that which beareth thorns and briars is
[2:21] rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose
[2:23] end is to be burned
[2:26] now
[2:27] a lot of times ministers as we study
[2:29] these things out what we're what we're
[2:31] doing is we're hunting
[2:32] we go we go hunting for um for like
[2:35] clinching quotes and clenching
[2:37] scriptures because you know paul says it
[2:39] in a way
[2:40] it's kind of hard maybe to to grasp
[2:42] initially um but you know so i you know
[2:46] i i had a slide to show the quote from
[2:48] hebrews chapter six that i think really
[2:50] clinches what paul is talking about here
[2:53] where brother adam said
[2:54] see what he's talking about now this is
[2:56] in the sermon hebrews chapter six that
[2:58] where brother brown was preaching on
[2:59] this uh this this scripture this this
[3:02] chapter
[3:03] he said see what he's talking about
[3:06] he's not talking about christians
[3:08] falling away
[3:09] impossible to come back
[3:11] he's talking about carnal believers
[3:14] who grow who go through the form of
[3:16] reformation
[3:18] but he said to you who was born again
[3:21] you who are christian beloved
[3:24] we are persuaded later on in chapter six
[3:26] you'll read he says
[3:28] we are persuaded better things of you
[3:31] of a christian he's you're persuaded to
[3:33] keep going on to not just stop at
[3:35] justification and not just stop a
[3:36] sanctification but to keep going on
[3:39] that's right to not because uh he he
[3:41] doesn't want to see see thorns and
[3:43] thistles born of you but to actually see
[3:45] that the fruit of the doctrine that
[3:47] you've received that christ is
[3:49] manifested in your flesh
[3:51] yeah that's what that's what god is
[3:54] looking to see
[3:55] in a born-again christian's life
[3:57] to you who was born again you who are
[3:59] christian beloved we are persuaded
[4:00] better things of you
[4:02] you don't say those things you don't
[4:03] live that type of life
[4:06] you're secured
[4:07] with christ
[4:09] and so in the pergamian church age he
[4:11] said
[4:12] and there it is you can't claim that
[4:15] manifestation is the evidence of being
[4:17] spirit born spirit-filled
[4:19] no sir
[4:21] i will admit that true manifestation is
[4:23] the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[4:25] mighty acts
[4:26] but it is not the evidence of the
[4:28] individual being spirit-filled even
[4:30] though that individual has an abundance
[4:31] of those manifestations
[4:33] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[4:35] today
[4:36] is just the same as it was back in the
[4:39] day of the lord amen it is receiving the
[4:42] word of truth for the day in which you
[4:44] live
[4:46] jesus never did stress the importance of
[4:48] the work says he did the word he knew
[4:50] that if the people got the word
[4:52] the works would follow
[4:55] so we don't put the cart before the
[4:56] horse we won't we won't we don't want to
[4:59] try to force something
[5:00] but if you receive the word i said
[5:02] what's happening when you receive the
[5:03] word the word is
[5:05] is taking a hold of your life and
[5:07] changing your life and producing christ
[5:10] in your life
[5:11] and so you know a lot of people you'll
[5:13] try to i'm i want to get rid of this
[5:15] thing in my life i want to
[5:16] get get rid of iniquity
[5:19] what's going to get rid of iniquity
[5:21] mercy and truth because as you receive
[5:23] the word it drives out
[5:25] everything that's unclean and it begins
[5:27] to change your thinking and change the
[5:28] way that you act and change your life
[5:31] and it's an automatic process because as
[5:34] you receive the word it's going to have
[5:36] that effect in your life
[5:39] so in luke chapter 13
[5:41] to just kind of uh
[5:43] piggyback off of that
[5:44] that that that down in your soul there
[5:47] could be something wrong even though
[5:49] you're anointed in your spirit that's
[5:51] what jesus was talking about in luke
[5:52] chapter 13 verses 23 to 26 when he said
[5:55] when someone asked him sin then said
[5:57] unto him lord are there few that be
[5:59] saved and he said unto them
[6:01] strive to enter into the straight gate
[6:03] for many i say unto you will seek to
[6:05] enter in and shall not be able
[6:08] when once the master of the house is
[6:09] risen up and shut to the door and you
[6:11] begin to stand without and to knock at
[6:13] the door saying lord lord open unto us
[6:15] and he shall answer and say unto you i
[6:17] know you not whence ye are
[6:19] then shall ye begin to say we have eaten
[6:21] and drunk in thy presence and now has
[6:23] taught in our streets
[6:25] but he shall say i tell you i know you
[6:27] not when you are depart from me all ye
[6:29] workers of iniquity
[6:31] and we've been kind of diving into
[6:33] iniquity because that's this is really
[6:35] it goes along with what paul is talking
[6:37] about he's he's saying you need to be
[6:39] born again
[6:40] and being born again will drive out the
[6:42] iniquity from your soul
[6:44] where brother brown would say he'd say
[6:45] what is iniquity is something that you
[6:47] know that's right and you concede it and
[6:49] won't do it in your heart
[6:52] in your heart
[6:53] so that's where we're dealing the
[6:54] problem is your heart problem when jesus
[6:56] began to magnify the law and say that if
[6:59] you just look upon a woman with lust in
[7:00] your heart there's something wrong in
[7:02] your heart
[7:03] and so we want to get our problem right
[7:05] in our heart man how do you get the
[7:07] problem right in your heart by mercy and
[7:09] truth by receiving the word that changes
[7:11] your heart yes
[7:12] when you know that the bible teaches a
[7:14] certain thing and you won't do it that's
[7:16] iniquity
[7:18] and brother brown would say every man
[7:20] knows
[7:21] that he's got to be born again by the
[7:23] spirit of god you've got to receive the
[7:26] holy ghost
[7:27] so again that's what paul is talking
[7:29] about in hebrews chapter six
[7:31] i i'm maybe using a lot of repetition
[7:33] because i want the next time you go back
[7:35] and read the book of hebrews and you
[7:37] read the book of hebrews chapter six and
[7:39] you're you see what paul's talking about
[7:41] here that god has persuaded better
[7:42] things of you and that he uh by these
[7:45] two immutable things that paul's talking
[7:47] about a seed that he's talking about
[7:49] being born again
[7:51] have tasted of the good word of god and
[7:52] the powers of the world to come if they
[7:54] shall fall again to renew them again
[7:55] unto repentance seeing that crucified in
[7:57] themselves the son of god affection put
[7:58] him to an open shame
[8:00] somebody that knew what they needed to
[8:01] do and wouldn't do it that you need to
[8:03] be born again and we used before the
[8:06] example of nicodemus where jesus will
[8:08] sit there and talk to him and say you
[8:09] need to be born again but where was he
[8:11] on the day of pentecost
[8:15] and i i i wish i could pull this slide
[8:17] up and show this because these i i
[8:19] wanted to rehash some of these things
[8:21] that brother dale had said in the past
[8:23] that iniquity is the conceiving part of
[8:25] it the baby is the product the baby is
[8:27] what's brought forth an iniquity
[8:29] iniquity is that crooked thing that
[8:32] that's got your heart messed up
[8:34] an iniquity and he'd say we've already
[8:36] seen we were products of iniquity
[8:39] now listen to this now the new birth
[8:41] took care of the iniquity for our soul
[8:44] made a way for the body to be redeemed
[8:46] but the body is not yet redeemed yet
[8:49] it's still a product of iniquity
[8:52] so you get the iniquity taking care of
[8:53] your in your soul
[8:55] and yet there's still some things that
[8:57] have to be dealt with
[8:59] so he said again unless you're born
[9:00] again unless you are a christian you are
[9:02] totally a product of iniquity your soul
[9:06] is doomed for a devil's hell
[9:08] now again that's what paul paul is
[9:10] talking about a problem in somebody's
[9:12] soul that yeah you feel an anointing on
[9:14] your flesh but what's sown down in your
[9:17] heart what have you received
[9:19] what what you feel a lot of things you
[9:21] might feel like uh something on your
[9:23] flesh or something move in your spirit
[9:26] but have you received the word for your
[9:28] day
[9:30] and there's a lot of scriptures in the
[9:31] bible that talk about iniquity problems
[9:33] in people's
[9:35] problems in people's decision-making
[9:37] problems in people's ability to receive
[9:39] the word and to walk in it like job 34
[9:41] that said there is no darkness nor
[9:44] shadow of death
[9:45] where the workers of iniquity may hide
[9:47] themselves
[9:49] in psalm 14 it says have all the workers
[9:51] of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my
[9:54] people as they eat bread and call not
[9:56] upon the lord
[9:58] that's a pretty pretty uh interesting
[10:00] description of a worker of iniquity not
[10:02] having any knowledge no understanding
[10:05] and don't call on the lord
[10:07] don't have a relationship with god
[10:10] psalm 37 a psalm of david fret not
[10:12] thyself because of evildoers neither be
[10:14] thou envious against the workers of
[10:16] iniquity don't don't any see that's a
[10:19] problem many times some people that that
[10:21] that
[10:22] come to church and and are trying to be
[10:24] a christian they start looking at other
[10:25] people and and envy the people that you
[10:28] you're we're trying to escape the bonds
[10:30] of the earth the bonds of the flag we're
[10:32] trying to escape the pride of life and
[10:34] to look out and at people the workers of
[10:36] iniquity and to be envious of them
[10:38] that's what uh david is warning us here
[10:40] in psalm 37 fret not thyself because of
[10:43] evil doers
[10:44] don't be envious against the workers of
[10:46] iniquity
[10:47] the way of the lord in proverbs chapter
[10:49] 10 the way of the lord is the strength
[10:51] to the upright but destruction shall be
[10:53] to the workers of iniquity
[10:55] psalm 28 says draw me not away with the
[10:58] wicked and with the workers of iniquity
[10:59] which speak peace to their neighbors but
[11:01] mischief is in their hearts so where
[11:04] what's what's the iniquity that the
[11:06] scripture is is pointing out to us that
[11:08] that if you're kind to your neighbors
[11:10] and you're on the out on outwardly you
[11:12] look like um
[11:15] you're being nice and it looks like
[11:16] you're good a good person but on the
[11:18] inside there's something crooked and out
[11:20] of place
[11:22] that's what iniquity is that crooked
[11:24] thing that's got you messed up from your
[11:26] birth that the only antidote to is is
[11:29] the word of god
[11:30] and so luke chapter 13 says but he shall
[11:32] depart i tell you i know you not when
[11:35] she are depart from me all you workers
[11:37] of iniquity and and second thessalonians
[11:39] goes to goes on to say
[11:41] remember you not that when i was yet
[11:43] with you i told you these things
[11:45] and now you know
[11:47] what withholdeth that he might be
[11:48] revealed in his time for the mystery of
[11:50] iniquity that's already work
[11:52] only he who now let us let what's he
[11:55] talking about again the holy ghost until
[11:57] he be taken out of the way because when
[11:59] the holy ghost is taken out of the way
[12:01] then that mystery of iniquity will be
[12:02] revealed
[12:03] then you'll see what iniquity really is
[12:05] it's a mystery what a mystery is
[12:07] something that's not quite quite
[12:09] seen
[12:10] in its fullness yet it's a mysterious
[12:12] thing
[12:13] but as as we understand the word the the
[12:16] myst the mysterious part of it is taken
[12:18] away
[12:20] so again in leadership brother and would
[12:22] say many of you think i got the baptism
[12:24] of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven
[12:26] that don't mean one thing that you're
[12:28] going to heaven
[12:30] no sir
[12:31] you can have the baptism of the holy
[12:33] ghost every hour in your life
[12:35] and still be lost and go to hell
[12:39] the bible says so
[12:41] and that's that quote that stumbled many
[12:43] people over the years i've talked to
[12:44] many people that were that were tripped
[12:46] up by that quote and did not understand
[12:47] that and stumbled but i think by when
[12:50] you read hebrews chapter 6 it enlightens
[12:53] that and you can begin to understand
[12:55] that you can have the holy ghost in your
[12:56] spirit
[12:58] and but not receive the word for your
[13:01] day
[13:02] and i
[13:03] i i i want to just nail this down before
[13:06] we get into the two immutable things
[13:08] because this is this is what paul is
[13:09] talking about it may be a hard to
[13:10] understand way but you must be born
[13:13] again
[13:14] and the anointed ones at the end time he
[13:15] said what is iniquity he said ask
[13:17] somebody it's something that you know
[13:19] you ought to do and you won't do it they
[13:21] know that word
[13:22] they hear it you're listening to this
[13:24] tape you're listening to this message
[13:28] you see the lord god say so you see him
[13:30] confirm it make it true
[13:32] and you know this just as plain as the
[13:34] sun is shining outside but you that'll
[13:36] hold on to your denomination
[13:38] hold on to those false things you worker
[13:41] of iniquity
[13:47] let me read this one last quote before
[13:49] we before we keep moving on
[13:51] in hebrews chapter six he said
[13:54] now you can be all worked up in emotion
[13:56] by speaking in tongues
[13:58] shouting jerking shaking running up and
[14:00] down the aisle nothing against that
[14:03] but you can make yourself believe that
[14:04] you're saved when you're not you're not
[14:06] saved your life will prove what you are
[14:10] jesus said it would
[14:12] by their fruit she shall know them your
[14:14] life will prove whether you're saved or
[14:17] not
[14:18] if you never open your mouth
[14:20] it'll prove what you are
[14:22] but all this work up and emotion and
[14:24] joining church and i've been baptized in
[14:26] jesus name
[14:27] hallelujah i know i got it that doesn't
[14:30] mean nothing
[14:31] i've been baptized named father son holy
[14:34] ghost face forward three times i got it
[14:36] that means nothing paul said let's go on
[14:38] to perfection now we're talking about
[14:41] perfected
[14:42] and if we run this down
[14:44] you'll find out the perfected
[14:46] is the elected
[14:48] so you know in that quote he said your
[14:50] life will prove what you are
[14:52] and my contention has always been that
[14:54] there's really those two evidences of
[14:56] the new birth faith and works that faith
[14:58] is your your revelation of the word but
[15:00] it's going to produce a life
[15:02] that's why in john chapter 10 he said if
[15:04] jesus said if i do not the works of my
[15:06] father believe me not but if i do
[15:10] though you believe not me believe the
[15:11] works that ye may know and believe that
[15:14] the father is in me and i in him so if
[15:17] that's how you knew that the father was
[15:19] in jesus that's how you'll know that the
[15:20] father is in us because it has
[15:22] transformed their life and the things
[15:24] that you used to do you don't do them
[15:25] anymore
[15:26] in james chapter 2
[15:28] james said thou believers that there is
[15:30] one god thou doest well the devils also
[15:32] believe and tremble but wilt thou know o
[15:35] vain man that faith without works is
[15:38] dead so brother ram is saying your life
[15:40] will prove whether you're saved or not
[15:43] if you never open your mouth mouth
[15:45] that'll prove what you are
[15:47] because outwardly you come to church and
[15:49] you read your bible and you're paying
[15:50] your tithes and you're doing the things
[15:52] that a christian does and it proves that
[15:54] something's changed on the inside
[15:59] so let's back up and read
[16:01] and to get kind of get where we are in
[16:03] hebrews chapter 6. if you've got your
[16:05] bible you can follow along from verse 1
[16:09] therefore leaving the principles of the
[16:11] doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[16:13] perfection
[16:14] not laying again the foundation of
[16:16] repentance from dead works and of faith
[16:18] toward god or the doctrine of baptisms
[16:20] and of laying on of hands and of
[16:22] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[16:23] judgment and this will we do of god
[16:26] permit for it is impossible for those
[16:28] who were once enlightened
[16:30] and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[16:32] and were made partakers of the holy
[16:34] ghost
[16:35] and have tasted the good word of god
[16:37] and the powers of the world to come
[16:39] if they shall fall away to renew them
[16:41] again unto repentance seeing they
[16:43] crucify to themselves the son of god
[16:45] afresh and put him to an open shame
[16:48] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[16:49] that cometh off upon it and bringeth
[16:51] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[16:53] dressed
[16:54] received with a blessing from god
[16:56] but that which beareth thorns and briars
[16:58] is rejected and deny into cursing whose
[17:01] end is to be burned
[17:02] but beloved we are persuaded better
[17:05] things of you
[17:06] and things that accompany salvation
[17:09] though we thus speak
[17:11] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[17:13] your work and labor of love which ye
[17:15] have shown toward his name and that ye
[17:17] minister to the saints and do minister
[17:19] and we desire that every one of you to
[17:21] show the same diligence to the full
[17:24] assurance of hope until the end what's
[17:26] paul saying is that keep stay diligent
[17:29] and and be keep
[17:30] keeping your consistency and uh keep
[17:33] keep
[17:34] pressing forward
[17:36] say he says in verse 12 that you be not
[17:39] slothful
[17:40] but followers of them who through faith
[17:42] and patience
[17:44] inherit the promises for when god made
[17:47] promise to abraham because he could
[17:49] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[17:53] now now think think about this
[17:55] when i i i many times we we'll make a
[17:57] promise to one another i'm going gonna
[17:59] be at your house
[18:00] next tuesday or whatever i'm gonna
[18:02] i'm i'm gonna be we're gonna go and
[18:04] we're gonna do something or whatever and
[18:05] then then it rains a thunderstorm will
[18:07] come up maybe your car breaks down so us
[18:10] in our humanity we we make promises and
[18:13] things we we try to keep and we want to
[18:15] keep
[18:16] we're not that even what we're lying but
[18:19] we just in our humanity that we can't
[18:21] keep
[18:22] but here's a god
[18:24] god
[18:25] that can when he says something he's
[18:27] going to make it come to pass
[18:31] a god think about a god when god says
[18:33] something he's he cannot lie right
[18:36] so the bible's saying forgot when god
[18:38] made promise to abraham because he could
[18:40] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[18:44] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[18:46] and multiplying out will multiply thee
[18:48] and so after he had patiently endured he
[18:50] obtained the promise
[18:52] now that that promise that that that
[18:55] that that god made to abraham was back
[18:57] there in genesis chapter 22 and all
[18:59] through the the story of abraham
[19:02] because god kept reiterating his promise
[19:04] and he'd say he said in genesis chapter
[19:06] 22 verse 16 and by myself have i sworn
[19:10] saith the lord
[19:11] for because thou has done this thing and
[19:13] has not withheld thy son that only son
[19:16] but if you drop down to verse 18 you'll
[19:18] see how the promise that he made to
[19:19] abraham
[19:20] has got you wrapped into it
[19:22] because he made a promise to the seed of
[19:25] abraham
[19:26] and he said and in thy seed shall all
[19:28] the nations of the earth be blessed
[19:30] because
[19:31] thou hast obeyed my voice
[19:33] so he made a promise to abraham that he
[19:35] was going to carry him through you see
[19:37] how the whole theme of this chapter of
[19:39] hebrews chapter 6 is you've got to be
[19:41] born again and when you're born again
[19:44] it carries there's some promises that
[19:46] are wrapped up in there that that gives
[19:48] you a hope that you can anchor your soul
[19:50] to that you can anchor everything to
[19:52] if you look in the bible and see the
[19:54] impact of these promises that god has
[19:56] made that will give you hope and
[19:58] assurance
[19:59] and and the way that
[20:01] the way that he got god didn't just say
[20:04] it in this case but he gave two
[20:07] immutable things that we could have
[20:08] confidence with
[20:10] now listen as we read on that as paul
[20:12] said he said for men verily swear by the
[20:15] greater
[20:16] because you always you got to make an
[20:17] oath by something greater than yourself
[20:19] and an oath for confirmation is to them
[20:21] an end of all strife wherein god willing
[20:24] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[20:26] of promise the immutability of his
[20:28] counsel confirmed it by an oath now what
[20:30] immutability means is something that no
[20:33] matter what you do to it you cannot
[20:36] change it
[20:38] it's kind of hard to even envision
[20:40] imagine something that's immutable
[20:41] because you take a rock wall and you
[20:43] chip on it long enough and you're gonna
[20:45] chip off little flecks of it
[20:47] but immutability means you can't change
[20:49] it
[20:50] so a a a granite wall maybe you'd be
[20:53] able to change it over time if the wind
[20:54] and the rain washed away at it long
[20:56] enough but but we're talking about a a
[21:00] god that his counsel is so immutable
[21:03] that it no matter what it will never
[21:05] change it cannot be changed when god
[21:08] says something is is unchanging
[21:11] so he says by
[21:13] wearing god willing more abundantly to
[21:14] show into the areas of promise the
[21:16] immutability of his council confirmed it
[21:18] by an oath that by two immutable things
[21:21] in which it was impossible for god to
[21:23] lie
[21:24] we might have a strong consolation
[21:27] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[21:29] upon the hope set before us
[21:32] so we got two things
[21:34] and what two things can we look into the
[21:36] scripture and see and and hang on to
[21:40] brother brown would say we have two
[21:41] things yes
[21:42] first
[21:43] his word said he would do it
[21:46] so when he made a promise that he's
[21:47] going to carry you through
[21:49] and when he made a promise that he's
[21:51] going to give you the holy ghost if
[21:52] you'll just believe him he's going to
[21:54] carry through with it
[21:55] the second
[21:57] was his sworn oath on it
[21:59] so just to make it double confirmed he
[22:02] swore an oath on top of that on top of
[22:05] the fact that
[22:06] god cannot lie he made an oath on top of
[22:09] that
[22:10] so you've got a double confirmation it's
[22:12] a brother i said he would do it to know
[22:14] this that god has promised us by a sworn
[22:17] oath one
[22:19] that he cannot lie
[22:21] god cannot lie
[22:23] and the other he swore an oath on top of
[22:26] that
[22:27] and what was it so now brother brown is
[22:29] bringing it over into the new testament
[22:31] that he will raise us up at the last day
[22:34] and give us eternal life
[22:36] so you see how your your story is
[22:39] wrapped up in the promise that god gave
[22:41] to abraham
[22:42] god made an uh an oath to abraham
[22:46] to that he was gonna
[22:48] that his seed would bless the whole
[22:49] world that that his
[22:52] all your seed will be as the stars of
[22:54] heaven and abraham standing out there on
[22:56] the sand looking up at the stars and not
[22:58] maybe not even realizing what truly that
[23:00] meant that one day on the day of
[23:02] pentecost god would fill men and women
[23:04] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:06] and that promise would go throughout all
[23:09] the world
[23:12] why because god
[23:14] made a promise
[23:15] and confirmed it by an oath and we have
[23:18] two immutable things
[23:20] that we can look to with confidence
[23:23] now brother ram said in jesus christ the
[23:25] same yesterday today and forever
[23:27] he said father god he was praying a
[23:29] prayer he said it is most solemnly that
[23:31] we come to the
[23:32] you have declared yourself you're not
[23:34] guilty of your promise anymore you made
[23:36] it true for the bible said that
[23:39] god cannot lie
[23:41] the immutable things god cannot lie
[23:44] and god swore that he would do it
[23:47] if we could only believe it
[23:50] then we see jesus said this morning in
[23:52] the reading
[23:54] that the scriptures cannot be broken
[23:57] so brother rahm said in and he swore by
[23:59] himself he said
[24:01] god made an oath promised abraham and
[24:04] swore by himself that i'll save you and
[24:06] your seed after you
[24:08] what is the seed of abraham now
[24:10] who is the one that's got this sure hold
[24:13] who was the one that's built on this
[24:14] foundation
[24:16] not just every tom dick and harry not
[24:18] all that saith to me lord lord will
[24:20] enter in but the one that doeth the will
[24:22] of my father which is in heaven and this
[24:25] is the father's will this is his word
[24:28] and you see how everything in that
[24:29] chapter ties together that he's saying
[24:31] just because you feel an anointing or
[24:33] something that that's not that's not a
[24:35] sure anchor but when you've got a
[24:37] revelation of the word and you're
[24:38] walking in the wheel in the father's
[24:41] will
[24:42] then you you're tied back into those two
[24:45] immutable things
[24:46] that god made a promise that he'll never
[24:48] leave you
[24:52] that he'll fill you with the holy ghost
[24:54] and that will carry you through
[24:56] despite all the problems that abraham
[24:59] had despite all the all the problems
[25:02] with those old testament saints god
[25:04] carried him through because he gave an
[25:06] unconditional covenant
[25:08] and that's what the baptism the holy
[25:10] ghost is when god gives you that promise
[25:12] he'll carry you through to despite all
[25:15] of your faults all of your failings
[25:17] he'll he's going to carry you through
[25:18] because he made a promise
[25:21] and in hebrews chapter 6
[25:23] verse chapter 2 uh chapter 6 number two
[25:26] that brother and priest he said
[25:28] and uh the musicians can go ahead and
[25:30] come forward we'll we'll close on this
[25:32] on this quote he said notice
[25:34] god made a promise to abraham
[25:36] unconditional
[25:37] and now wait abraham did not have to do
[25:40] one thing
[25:41] god said i have already done it
[25:44] god made a promise to adam said adam if
[25:46] you'll not touch this you'll live
[25:47] forever but the day you eat there oh
[25:49] that day you die adam said i just wonder
[25:51] what's all about anyway he goes over and
[25:53] he's at tampering
[25:54] every time that god made a man makes his
[25:57] covenant with god or god with a man the
[25:59] man breaks his part so god had to do
[26:01] something because he's seen what man was
[26:04] and they were for ordained they were
[26:05] elected and god had to do something so
[26:08] god came down
[26:10] and made his covenant with abraham
[26:12] unconditionally
[26:14] if it wouldn't have been unconditionally
[26:16] abraham would have been lost a long time
[26:19] that's what paul is talking about that
[26:21] by two immutable things in which it was
[26:24] impossible for god to lie we might have
[26:26] a strong consolation who have fled for
[26:29] refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[26:31] set before us we'll stop right there god
[26:34] bless you
[26:38] [Applause]
[26:44] [Music]
[26:59] you
