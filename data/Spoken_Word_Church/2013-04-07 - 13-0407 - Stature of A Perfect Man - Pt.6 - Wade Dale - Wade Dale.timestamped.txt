[0:00] good we had a good time
[0:04] this facility to have it at
[0:08] all right second Peter chapter one
[0:12] you missed the chicken up well you can
[0:14] go back and sit down and play with the
[0:16] Flies and we'll go out there to the
[0:18] Guilford park or they it's not anything
[0:19] that was nice yeah that was good yeah
[0:23] not cotton flies if I mean it would have
[0:26] been nice if you brought the vehicle to
[0:28] have the hayride oh well yeah that's
[0:30] true
[0:32] we'll do that more in the um
[0:40] oh yeah
[0:52] this thing won't stay on but a couple of
[0:54] seconds
[1:21] get him John
[1:23] praise the Lord
[1:25] okay second Peter chapter one
[1:28] like what we were talking about last
[1:30] night in the Bible study
[1:31] which was a wonderful setting outside
[1:33] around the campfire that was good II
[1:36] Peter chapter one
[1:38] there had to be somebody come to a
[1:41] position
[1:43] that they could tell us how to have
[1:45] faith how to have virtue how to have
[1:47] knowledge how to have Temperance and
[1:50] what better person than Peter who had a
[1:51] problem with all that right when Jesus
[1:54] was here
[1:57] but then what about a great where uh
[2:00] Peter says I was on the mountain with
[2:02] the Lord I Saw the Transfiguration I saw
[2:04] this I walked with the Lord I walked
[2:06] here I did this
[2:07] but now I have a more sure word of
[2:09] Prophecy because it wasn't just Jesus
[2:11] talking to him anymore it was Jesus
[2:12] inside of him talking out
[2:15] but we believe the Holy Ghost is inside
[2:17] of us speaking out right not just Jesus
[2:20] somewhere we know there's a physical
[2:21] Jesus somewhere but he said I'll send
[2:24] back the comforter right in my father's
[2:28] name
[2:32] that's right this is the god this is the
[2:35] god this could be a god India there's
[2:37] three million Gods all right g-o-d-s
[2:40] that's just a title that's just a an
[2:42] object of worship so what was the
[2:44] father's name Jesus there was no other
[2:46] name God ever had said Jesus Christ all
[2:48] right or you got two Gods that's right
[2:51] so we see that Peter came up and said
[2:53] now I have a more sure word of Prophecy
[2:55] in other words it wasn't second-hand
[2:57] information
[2:59] that's what we're dealing with now we're
[3:01] not dealing with second-hand information
[3:02] sure we have to get it from a minister
[3:04] we have to get it from from each other
[3:08] but it's gone doing this feeling
[3:10] if Paul says we must have the mind of
[3:13] Christ and he was lying if we didn't
[3:14] that's right and we know he wasn't lying
[3:17] because it's in the holy word and it's
[3:18] Eternal so we are in the positive Mind
[3:23] Of God Paul says we have the mind of
[3:25] Christ you say we're going to have he
[3:26] said we have the mind of God all right
[3:28] so to have the minds of Christ is to
[3:31] have Christ speaking out right remind me
[3:34] of that I postponed that for a minute
[3:36] but now we're looking at the Statue of a
[3:39] perfect man and our title is lend me a
[3:42] sermon
[3:43] because that's what that is so now Peter
[3:45] with the Holy Ghost he didn't take out a
[3:48] physical sword
[3:50] like he did and cut the ear off of the
[3:52] man he's taking a spiritual sword
[3:56] and doing the work
[3:58] right right
[3:59] he says now we're going to take the the
[4:01] sword of the word
[4:03] and I'm going to teach you how to become
[4:06] because what
[4:08] all the things Peter went through all
[4:10] the adversity Peter went through but on
[4:12] the day of Pentecost who was the first
[4:14] man that walked out the door and said
[4:16] hey
[4:17] this is that
[4:18] that one 30-minute sermon converted 3
[4:23] 000 people
[4:25] and filled them with a Holy Ghost
[4:27] now I didn't fill them with a holy ghost
[4:28] like Peter had it because Peter had
[4:30] walked with God himself for three and a
[4:33] half years and God had was sitting there
[4:36] teaching them these virtues they were
[4:39] watching what Jesus was doing
[4:42] right because he was the he's the very
[4:45] stature of a perfect man the only
[4:46] perfect man there ever was that's great
[4:48] but you know what
[4:51] he didn't stay the only perfect man
[4:54] because remember he wants Stones just
[4:56] like him
[4:58] what would a father a father wants a son
[5:00] to be just like him all right so he
[5:03] wants us to be like him so he gave us
[5:06] the ability through the Holy Ghost not
[5:08] an anointing not something that just
[5:09] comes by an anoints you every once in a
[5:11] while but a feeling so where when you
[5:14] walk down the road
[5:15] that's God walking down the road
[5:18] we got to get to that point like Daddy
[5:20] said last night we got to get to the
[5:22] point to where God's not over under
[5:23] somewhere even Moses said that Moses
[5:26] said God's Not Over the state God's not
[5:27] over here where you gotta no he's
[5:29] neither
[5:31] even in thy mouth the word of faith we
[5:35] preach right all right so that's what
[5:38] we're doing now is yeah you got to hear
[5:40] it from a preacher
[5:41] because the Bible says in Ephesians
[5:44] right the Apostle prophets passive
[5:47] teachers in evangelists to perfect the
[5:49] Saints so you got to hear it through a
[5:51] five-fold Ministry a Ministry of five
[5:54] different officers
[5:56] some in teaching some in preaching
[6:00] some in evangelism missionary work
[6:03] through those five
[6:05] offices God speaks to us but you know
[6:08] what we have to do
[6:09] we have to take that what's inside of us
[6:11] and agree with it or disagree
[6:15] okay so it works both ways it doesn't
[6:18] work just God's Gonna Get No it works
[6:20] both ways because remember Pete uh Paul
[6:23] and James are not fighting each other as
[6:25] far as works and faith
[6:28] your works is your faith expressed
[6:30] that's right okay so you got to have
[6:33] faith
[6:35] gotta have faith down here at the bottom
[6:37] you gotta have faith big wide Foundation
[6:39] Faith covers a lot of things and that's
[6:41] what we're going to read today we're
[6:43] going to read in a second Peter and then
[6:44] we're going to turn over to Hebrews 11.
[6:47] so let's read second Peter and just get
[6:48] a basis of what's going on here and then
[6:50] we'll read a few quotes from The Prophet
[6:53] second Peter chapter one Simon Peter a
[6:57] servant an impossible Jesus Christ to
[6:59] them that have obtained like Precious
[7:01] faith
[7:03] all right so he's not talking to the
[7:05] center he's not talking to the world
[7:06] he's not talking to the president of the
[7:07] United States
[7:09] he's talking to you if you're born again
[7:11] if you have obtained this same faith
[7:13] that he has he's talking to you okay all
[7:17] right excuse me light precious Faith
[7:19] with us through the righteousness not
[7:21] Peter's righteousness not yours but
[7:24] through the righteousness of God and our
[7:25] Savior Jesus Christ all right
[7:28] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[7:30] look at all these multiplied and abound
[7:32] Peter's telling him said hey man if you
[7:34] get what I got
[7:35] you're just going to overflow
[7:37] because remember what I said about Peter
[7:39] Peter goes to the gate beautiful he does
[7:42] not have enough money to pay for that
[7:45] lame man to go to the doctor
[7:48] I was telling him last weekend and
[7:49] brother brother brothers he went he went
[7:51] after the guy and got he went
[7:53] I'm poor fisherman
[7:55] I ain't got no money
[7:57] I ain't got a dollar to give you
[8:00] watch what he said Peter said Silver and
[8:02] Gold Have I know in other words I don't
[8:03] have the ability to pay for you to go to
[8:05] the doctor
[8:06] but such as I have
[8:09] he didn't have to go get it he didn't
[8:10] have to go pray for it he didn't have to
[8:11] go ask the priest for it he had it such
[8:15] as I have give out of Thee Well what is
[8:17] that that's virtue
[8:19] that strength that man Drew strength
[8:22] from what Peter was saying
[8:24] and Peter had it already
[8:27] he had faith in what he spoke would
[8:30] happen
[8:32] now that's the way you and I are gonna
[8:34] have to be that's right not like popping
[8:36] popcorn we're not going to go out and
[8:38] like say every time you walk by somebody
[8:40] they're gonna get healed but you know
[8:41] what
[8:43] these people that were in that time
[8:46] the Bible says they would walk down the
[8:48] street in the lane that was sitting
[8:49] beside the road when the shadow passed
[8:52] them right that wasn't the shadow
[8:54] it wasn't the shadow that healed them
[8:56] it was the faith they had in the people
[8:58] walking by because they saw virtue they
[9:04] saw knowledge they saw temperatures in
[9:07] other words they were able to draw off
[9:08] of what those people already had
[9:11] not what they were going to get what
[9:13] they already had all right
[9:15] so Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[9:17] you through the knowledge of God and
[9:19] Jesus our lord according as his divine
[9:21] power I like that word divine there's
[9:24] not a lot of things Divine on this Earth
[9:26] they may call it Divine this and divine
[9:28] that there's nothing Divine on this
[9:29] earth right except me and you if we're
[9:31] born again
[9:34] we get the divine nature of God then
[9:37] your makes
[9:39] hmm
[9:41] well I don't think we're close enough
[9:42] yet
[9:43] according as his divine power hath given
[9:47] unto us a gift given unto us
[9:51] all things that pertaineth unto life and
[9:54] godliness so this is life lessons and
[9:57] how to be like God
[9:58] okay
[10:01] through the knowledge of him that have
[10:03] called us
[10:04] to glory and virtue so he's called us to
[10:07] something all right
[10:09] whereby are given now given that's a
[10:12] gift he like in other words he said in
[10:14] the book of Acts it says repent be
[10:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[10:17] the mission of your sin and ye shall
[10:21] receive the what gift of the Holy Ghost
[10:25] called the promises to you and your
[10:27] children them to the far off mean which
[10:28] means we want our guys are called but
[10:30] you got to remember it says repent
[10:33] and then be baptized in the name of
[10:35] Jesus Christ all right for the remission
[10:36] you're sin
[10:38] and then you shall receive the gift so
[10:40] there's a process there but watch watch
[10:41] Peter saying whereby are given unto us
[10:44] exceeding see there's another adjective
[10:46] this
[10:47] the same God's going to give you this
[10:49] stuff and he's not just going to give it
[10:50] to you in a little bitty teacup measure
[10:54] we got to come to the stature of the
[10:55] fullness of Christ the man walking with
[10:57] all the virtues in their life he's a
[10:59] statue of God walking on the earth
[11:00] whereby have given unto us exceeding
[11:03] great and precious promises that by
[11:06] these you might be partakers all right
[11:10] uh for taking something we're going to
[11:12] be partakers of the divine nature of God
[11:15] all right
[11:17] having escaped the corruption that is in
[11:19] the world through lust and besides this
[11:24] see you got to have all that before you
[11:25] get this and besides this in other words
[11:29] I've told you what to get get born again
[11:31] get the new birth be born again
[11:34] have the faith of God for what you need
[11:37] at your level of understanding have the
[11:40] faith of God and then besides that
[11:44] add to your faith see see this is this
[11:48] is not one two three four five six seven
[11:51] eight ads in the Bible there's only
[11:53] seven add to your faith
[11:55] well this is your faith
[12:00] go and give me the Holy Ghost just mine
[12:01] brother Roger it's not it's not his
[12:03] anymore it's mine you give it to me so
[12:05] it's mine he's on any Giver he don't
[12:07] want it back he wants to give it more
[12:10] than you want it actually so have faith
[12:12] and add to your faith one two three four
[12:16] five six seven answer your faith all
[12:20] right are you seeing this word says holy
[12:22] spirit that's not the new birth right
[12:23] there
[12:24] you say oh wow oh wait a minute
[12:27] Paul says I Die daily right this man we
[12:31] call Peter
[12:32] says being born again look that word
[12:34] being up ongoing process that's right
[12:39] sure you have one major birth that
[12:41] cleans you out gets rid of the old
[12:42] nature but then God wants to completely
[12:45] fill you and he just keeps filling we
[12:47] can't stand it as humans so he does he
[12:49] knows that so he's not going to give it
[12:50] all to us at one time right we get it in
[12:53] stages just like that baby we talk about
[12:55] the baby that baby over there she's got
[12:57] every faculty she needs little Jonas has
[13:00] got every faculty he needs to drive a
[13:02] car
[13:03] he's not gonna gain any new parts to be
[13:05] able to drive a car but now you're going
[13:07] to let him drive a car no one
[13:10] he hasn't come to the knowledge
[13:13] of being able or mature enough but he's
[13:15] got everything he needs he's a human
[13:17] he's got a body of spirit and soul he's
[13:19] got everything he needs he can go out
[13:21] there and get in the car and sit down
[13:22] hold on to the standpoint
[13:25] but he's not fully developed
[13:27] that's the same way with you and I we're
[13:29] not a fully developed Christian you just
[13:31] begin your journey when you're born
[13:33] again that's just when God starts really
[13:36] dealing with you and really wanting to
[13:38] use you remember the Bible says God
[13:40] won't dwell in an unclean vessel so at
[13:42] least I'm going to use something that's
[13:43] not clean
[13:45] but once it's clean he can start filling
[13:47] the jar up and turning it on
[13:51] reminding me I'm keep posting on that I
[13:54] know you said too so thank you I saw you
[13:55] raise your hand all right
[13:57] so does anybody have any questions with
[13:59] that we've got to start besides this
[14:01] Peter says besides all this besides all
[14:04] verse 1 through 4.
[14:09] you escape the corruption of the world
[14:10] through us should we sure we still have
[14:13] problems we still have everyday life
[14:15] that we got to deal with but besides
[14:17] this
[14:18] or five and besides this giving all
[14:21] diligence
[14:23] that means it's not going to just be
[14:25] given to you just because you wake up in
[14:27] the morning in your life no you gotta
[14:31] let me see if I can remember the
[14:33] scripture the scripture says the kingdom
[14:34] of God is taken by force
[14:37] when Joshua went into the Promised Land
[14:41] the malachites and all those ice didn't
[14:44] just move back and say oh Joshua no he
[14:47] fought for every inch of ground
[14:50] so even typing the new birth going over
[14:52] into the promised land as Joshua took
[14:54] the promised land there was still ice in
[14:57] there
[14:58] television Heights and all these hikes
[15:01] that we got now all these things that we
[15:02] put in front of God you put every ice
[15:04] you want to
[15:05] hunting knives fishing nights late ice
[15:16] at least we have an example
[15:23] okay
[15:28] but you see what I'm talking about
[15:29] Joshua when he went into Promised Land
[15:31] that's what he had to do he had to fight
[15:32] for that ground and then when he got
[15:34] into the land and fought the ground
[15:36] pushed the people back then he took his
[15:38] people and what'd he do he positionally
[15:40] placed them where they needed to go
[15:42] speaking of another layer or another
[15:45] work of the Holy Ghost which is adoption
[15:47] adoption is placing you where you need
[15:50] to go
[15:51] he was able to put down an Ephraim and
[15:54] all the ones where they needed to go all
[15:56] right but there was still in the land he
[16:00] had to fight for it so you and I he that
[16:02] overcometh
[16:05] they don't say he just shows up
[16:08] all right this is not a
[16:12] it's not just he that shows up right he
[16:15] didn't overcome it
[16:17] all the things we need in the Bible to
[16:19] to defeat Satan it's not something you
[16:22] take to a picnic
[16:23] you take forks and spoons and knives to
[16:26] a picnic
[16:27] we're going to a battle swords
[16:29] word Shield
[16:31] helmet of righteousness all these things
[16:33] all right so it's a battle and that's
[16:34] what this is this is my brother Keith
[16:36] read always says these are life lessons
[16:38] these are things that we learn in life
[16:40] and that's why that
[16:42] Peter came to this position
[16:44] and he said besides this giving all
[16:46] diligence add to your faith see you made
[16:50] it personal he said don't add it God's
[16:52] faith God already got faith God is Faith
[16:54] that's right he's just wanting you to
[16:56] have faith in him right all right but
[16:59] when he gives you something it's a gift
[17:00] add to your faith
[17:03] in other words listen add to what you
[17:05] believe virtue that's right add to what
[17:09] you believe knowledge Right add to what
[17:11] you believe Temperance all right you got
[17:14] it what you believe if you don't believe
[17:16] you got it you can't ever have it
[17:19] how you gonna get something you can't
[17:20] believe him
[17:22] you gotta believe
[17:25] he that believeth unto
[17:28] right believe it that th has got a lot
[17:31] of meaning to it because it's an ongoing
[17:32] process that's right all right
[17:34] add to your faith virtue
[17:37] and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge
[17:40] temperance
[17:41] and to Temperance patience
[17:43] and to patience godliness and the
[17:45] godliness brother with kindness and
[17:47] brotherly kindness
[17:48] charity not like this verse 8 for if
[17:52] these things be on you
[17:55] oh what they say
[17:58] in you not on you
[18:02] there's a difference that's right
[18:06] the devil can anoint you yes
[18:09] come on the devil can anoint you because
[18:13] he was the anointed cherub yeah that
[18:15] anointing didn't come off of him he
[18:16] still got that anointing
[18:18] he's going to be destroyed one day but
[18:20] he's not one of these
[18:21] he's not a drunk and a thief and a
[18:23] I don't know let's just be playing right
[18:26] he's sitting in this building today
[18:27] that's right he came with you amen but
[18:30] hopefully not in you
[18:32] but he came around you he's right here
[18:36] he's here
[18:38] you just think just think in your human
[18:41] mind for a few minutes he's here that's
[18:43] right but you got to remember this
[18:45] rightly divides the Bible says the word
[18:47] of Truth so you know what's truth and
[18:50] what's error okay and this Faith virtue
[18:53] and all these different patience is
[18:54] drawing you closer to God and further
[18:56] away from him that's right amen because
[18:58] there's people that you want to be
[18:59] around in the world really honestly
[19:01] there's people like businessmen that I
[19:03] like to draw virtue from that may not
[19:05] even be born again but I draw strength
[19:08] of being able to handle finances or do
[19:11] things right or do you know do the right
[19:13] thing
[19:14] but now as far as my salvation I know
[19:17] where to separate that
[19:19] that man's not giving me salvation just
[19:20] because he's helping me with my finances
[19:22] that's right no that's just life lesson
[19:24] that's right but I know where to come on
[19:26] Sunday
[19:27] and on Wednesday to get the real life
[19:30] lesson then I can put the ones together
[19:32] that's right right that's right I mean
[19:35] you know we don't just we don't just
[19:38] haphazardly go through life there's a
[19:40] there's a way to do this
[19:43] because it says right here he says
[19:44] according his divine power hath given
[19:46] unto us all things that pertains into
[19:48] life and godliness he's given to us but
[19:51] now remember
[19:53] somebody gives you a gift
[19:55] you gotta take it
[19:57] or you can reject it
[19:59] that's right
[20:03] I mean somebody gives you a gift you can
[20:05] say no I don't know
[20:07] right but if you receive it like this
[20:10] tree said then you open these yours so
[20:12] whatever's in there is yours so God's
[20:14] give us a gift he said here if you want
[20:15] this gift is here
[20:17] open it if you want to because remember
[20:21] God is not going to go over
[20:23] your free moral agency that's right
[20:27] Now look for if these things be in you
[20:31] and abound
[20:33] not just be in you but abound I mean
[20:35] heaping abound means that you when you
[20:38] get a bountiful crop that don't mean you
[20:40] get four potatoes you get four thousand
[20:42] potatoes that's a bountiful crop if
[20:46] these things being you and abound they
[20:47] make you now I like that word make
[20:49] because you know what it's just like me
[20:50] making my kids do something
[20:53] if they've done all this it'll make you
[20:55] do this it'll make you be this kind of a
[20:57] person it'll make you that you shall
[20:59] neither be barren
[21:01] nor unfruitful
[21:03] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[21:05] Christ so there as we go through life
[21:07] take these life lessons and all the
[21:09] things that we're doing in life
[21:12] if you take that
[21:14] you take that with you
[21:17] you will neither be Barren or in
[21:19] fruitful
[21:20] not only just in finances not only just
[21:23] in being a good person but oh we're
[21:24] talking about a like I've always come
[21:26] out last night
[21:27] we have come to a place to where we can
[21:29] be
[21:31] the full stature of God
[21:34] has not been anywhere other any other
[21:36] time the full stature of God it's a
[21:38] requirement in this age to do that
[21:41] my Bible says for Darren that it's a big
[21:45] yes absolutely right because what is a
[21:48] what is a what is a Barren tree it's an
[21:51] idle tree it's a tree that that designs
[21:53] it's just not do anything right
[21:56] so that's the barren nor unfruitful in
[21:59] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:01] but he that lacketh these things is
[22:03] blind
[22:04] now if you look that word up blind it's
[22:07] gross Darkness that's not just blind
[22:09] physically
[22:10] you can be blind physically and and be
[22:12] enlightened spiritually but if you're
[22:15] blind spiritually I don't care if you
[22:17] got 20 20 Vision or 10 10 vision
[22:19] sorry
[22:22] and cannot see afar off in other words
[22:25] Revelation far off
[22:27] and have forgotten
[22:30] have we forgotten now this is written to
[22:32] Christians people this is not written to
[22:34] the world remember this is right the
[22:37] Christians
[22:40] because I wrote my Bible still talking
[22:42] to Christian
[22:44] because Peter hadn't forgot his thought
[22:45] he kept his thought going all the way
[22:47] through it's the one that had light
[22:48] pressure faith and the ones that are in
[22:49] the body of Christ
[22:51] don't fall into gross Darkness you say
[22:54] can I yeah you can do that you can blind
[22:56] yourself from the rest of the word
[22:57] you can
[22:59] right if you're idle or Idol either one
[23:02] or idle but if your idle you've got an
[23:06] idol serious okay
[23:09] everybody understand that if you're on
[23:12] dle you got an idol if you're I know
[23:15] you've got an idol that you're worth
[23:17] something you're worshiping besides God
[23:19] right
[23:22] that was good
[23:25] I had forgotten
[23:27] yeah sometimes we forget where we come
[23:29] from
[23:30] yeah come on people yeah we forgot where
[23:33] God brought us too yeah it is right our
[23:36] friend yes all right yeah and that
[23:40] forgotten that he has that he was purged
[23:43] from his old sin sometimes we forget
[23:46] that we gotta that's why it says being
[23:47] born again
[23:49] wow pulses I Die daily well Paul didn't
[23:52] die going to great no he meant the old
[23:55] nature man had to die now he was a
[23:58] prophet
[23:59] a guy that wrote the word of God
[24:01] that God wrote the word through
[24:04] right
[24:06] and he still had to die how much more
[24:09] you enough
[24:10] okay
[24:14] Bob leaving said Jesus learned about the
[24:16] things he suffered and being made
[24:18] perfect
[24:21] being made perfect
[24:24] all right
[24:25] verse 10 we're about wherefore the
[24:27] rather Brethren give diligence there's
[24:28] that word again look how much Peter is
[24:31] pressing
[24:32] he's pressing you've got to do this
[24:35] give diligence to make your calling and
[24:37] elections sure
[24:41] and I wrote a promise in my Bible right
[24:43] here for if you do these things
[24:46] you shall never fall
[24:51] if you do these things
[24:53] want the prescription of the doctors
[24:55] give you you do these things Dr Peter
[24:57] said if you do all these and I tell you
[24:59] to do you'll never fall
[25:02] that's what the Bible says
[25:05] you'll never fall if you'll do these
[25:07] things but don't start complaining
[25:10] if God don't fulfill this and we haven't
[25:13] got those the virtues because Peter says
[25:16] after all this
[25:18] if you'll do this prescription make it
[25:20] just like I said take this pill every
[25:22] day
[25:22] like this certain virtue every day
[25:25] knowledge every day Temperance every day
[25:27] learn from God every day
[25:30] then
[25:31] you shall never fall
[25:33] but our problem is
[25:35] is we don't do the total prescription
[25:38] and somewhere in the line will be fall
[25:40] but that's okay that's why this thing
[25:43] called Grace
[25:45] my grace is sufficient Jesus is gracious
[25:48] and efficient but now if we keep doing
[25:49] the same thing over and over and over
[25:51] again and five years later we're still
[25:52] doing the same thing
[25:54] you ain't got that's not dead yet
[25:57] you're just putting it over in a closet
[25:59] until you need it again then you open
[26:00] the door and pull it back out
[26:02] but if it's dead it's gone we don't
[26:03] believe in the resurrection of old junk
[26:06] we believe in Resurrection and units of
[26:08] Life That's What scripture says we plant
[26:10] them in corruption we raise them in
[26:11] incorruption all right so we're gonna
[26:14] plant this all these dead
[26:17] Nature's
[26:18] Natures that we got
[26:21] right that's what we got to do we got to
[26:24] plant we got to bury them
[26:25] not to be brought back again
[26:27] that's why I love when God told Moses
[26:29] said Moses
[26:31] tell these people this
[26:34] that if you walk out in that water you
[26:36] put the stick down
[26:38] Red Sea Park
[26:40] when you get across there you tell them
[26:44] that those Egyptians that they saw today
[26:48] they will never see no more
[26:53] now that makes me feel good that's good
[26:55] but now what did the people do they did
[26:57] exactly what Moses told them so when
[27:00] Moses got on the other side and the
[27:01] water come together and killed all those
[27:03] Egyptians which is the type of the
[27:04] things that we need to get rid of coming
[27:06] out of Egypt come out over my people
[27:08] Revelations 19. come out of her what the
[27:11] old system her church
[27:13] same thing with Moses he was bringing
[27:16] his people God's people out of the world
[27:18] into the Promised Land
[27:20] and he said those Egyptians you see this
[27:24] day that you saw this day you'll never
[27:26] see them again their dad
[27:30] we've had people go and pass on we're
[27:33] not going to see them again until the
[27:34] resurrection
[27:35] but that's just that's just an example
[27:37] but you know you don't go put somebody
[27:39] in the ground in two days later you see
[27:40] them again
[27:42] no it's almost dead it's dead that's
[27:45] right
[27:46] same thing with our own nature when it's
[27:47] dead it's dead and you'll know it's dead
[27:49] you know why because you don't see it no
[27:51] more
[27:52] oh he may come and and try to bring it
[27:55] to you remember the devil
[27:58] he's a master at this so if he can't get
[28:01] you this way
[28:04] he's just going to take and go right
[28:06] around the mountain and come in from the
[28:08] back side
[28:10] so be careful just keep that Shield up
[28:13] and make sure that when he does come
[28:16] powerful scripture says resist the devil
[28:19] and he'll flee from you that's pretty
[28:22] powerful but it's a very small scripture
[28:24] and we sometimes don't use it now let's
[28:26] go to Hebrews 11 we're going to start
[28:28] now talk on faith
[28:30] I'm going to read this quote here though
[28:32] we read it again from the statue of a
[28:33] perfect man in 1962 while you're turning
[28:38] Hebrews 11 1.
[28:40] brother Brian said that's the way it is
[28:41] with Christ you've got to be so in love
[28:43] with him because when we ask for
[28:45] something and he doesn't give it to us
[28:46] that doesn't shake us a bit
[28:49] remember I've always said God's nose are
[28:52] the best yeses you'll ever get because
[28:54] if he says yes he knows you the end from
[28:57] the beginning
[28:58] right
[29:00] so if he says yes then you're pretty
[29:02] much okay if he says no Then you know to
[29:04] forget going down that path if your son
[29:06] and daughter of God if he says no it's
[29:08] for your good all right
[29:12] and the only way we can do that the only
[29:15] way look the only thing is because a
[29:18] baby will go what why why why why why
[29:21] why why why why daddy why mama why why
[29:24] why why why why why why why why why you
[29:28] hear it remember
[29:30] and I said so means a lot but that's
[29:33] what God said he said I said so last one
[29:36] that's why we always say we said so but
[29:39] if you really sat down and broke it down
[29:40] and explained it to the kid which is not
[29:42] going to understand at that point but
[29:43] later on they will sit down and explain
[29:45] to him why
[29:48] I've always wanted somebody to explain
[29:49] to me the why if I'm doing something
[29:51] wrong don't just say you're wrong
[29:53] but now I want somebody to explain to me
[29:55] why I'm doing it wrong because you know
[29:56] what I may do it again but if you
[29:58] explain to me that it's wrong
[30:00] I don't know what the wrong is and I'll
[30:02] quit doing it now that's what he done
[30:03] that's what God's done every Sunday
[30:06] every Wednesday that's what he's doing
[30:08] that's right he's telling us you're
[30:10] wrong and this is where you're wrong and
[30:13] this is how to correct it that's right
[30:15] what a loving father that's what he's
[30:18] doing because we've got the wrong nature
[30:21] aren't we we got the wrong thinking the
[30:23] wrong we were born wrong remember
[30:25] born anti-word we weren't supposed to
[30:28] come this way all right we're supposed
[30:31] to be smoking seed children with God not
[30:33] not coming from the laundry of a man and
[30:35] the only way we can do that is to become
[30:37] partakers of this divine nature then
[30:40] you'll understand the reason
[30:42] he can't give it to you
[30:44] see you'll understand in other words
[30:46] he'll explain he's already explained
[30:50] what you doing wrong this is why
[30:52] and then he brings a preacher or teacher
[30:55] or a or or a brother or sister in the
[30:58] Lord
[30:59] to kind of just get beside of you and
[31:01] say hey this is kind of why that
[31:04] this is my experience
[31:06] and and this is what the Lord showed me
[31:10] because that's what a preacher's doing
[31:11] you're pulling on this gift
[31:14] and she has so many and I'm going to say
[31:16] this and I'm going to say I say after
[31:17] the till the day we get out of here
[31:20] preachers should be servants
[31:23] some leaders should be servants
[31:25] not I I mean me no
[31:28] we're there to serve you
[31:32] and if you want something out of a
[31:34] service
[31:35] have a need that's right you have a need
[31:38] and a want that's fine
[31:39] but you bring that knee before God and
[31:42] I'll guarantee you he'll put a preacher
[31:44] In a Pulpit
[31:46] how many times have we done something
[31:48] down here and me not finish it and daddy
[31:50] finish it upstairs and me and Dad don't
[31:53] talk about Services together because I
[31:54] don't want to pull him away from this
[31:56] and he don't want to pull me away from
[31:57] there so we don't talk about what we're
[31:58] going to create
[31:59] but many times and that's that's
[32:03] that's to me the virtues being shown
[32:05] working in Yemen because you did it I
[32:07] didn't do it I'm not saying I did it no
[32:09] no no no you did it you had that thought
[32:12] in your mind
[32:14] here
[32:15] heading upstairs and then when you got
[32:17] up there and sat down
[32:20] daddy may not have been gonna say that
[32:22] 10 minutes of what we talked about down
[32:25] here but God brings him right over
[32:27] because you do that you do it he doesn't
[32:29] do it and I don't do it same thing
[32:31] happens in the Bible study oh absolutely
[32:33] no doubt yeah and Bible stays the same
[32:35] way so that's why we that's why Peter
[32:38] says we can be partakers of this divine
[32:41] nature because you know what if you're
[32:43] born again and I'm born again
[32:45] good degree we have the same nature
[32:47] should be a Godly nature now we all I
[32:50] like hunting and fishing and don't care
[32:51] a thing about cars and Donnie here's
[32:53] caught by cars don't care anything about
[32:54] fishing that don't mean that's just
[32:56] human nature Human Nature
[32:59] but see we agree on the word and we and
[33:01] we're not conflicting when it comes to
[33:03] the word so see we can we can we can he
[33:06] can pull from in I can pull from him
[33:07] same way with hearing and I'm I'm going
[33:10] to say it again we're serving there's no
[33:12] great ones Among Us I love bird quality
[33:14] always mention that and that's true
[33:15] there's no great preachers great
[33:18] congregations make great preachers right
[33:22] it's true
[33:24] great congregations make great preachers
[33:27] you know brother Brown you know what he
[33:29] said he said if the will of the people
[33:31] was that the preacher preached
[33:34] a Trinity right
[33:36] then that's what the preacher preaches
[33:38] right right well I believe
[33:41] I'm not preaching the Trinity no such
[33:44] thing tomorrow
[33:45] but
[33:47] that's the will of the people that's
[33:49] true so we're nothing but just that
[33:51] we're just we're just a conduit
[33:55] to where I can spark something God says
[33:57] hey
[33:58] Brother Ray needs something
[34:01] but I'm not going to speak directly to
[34:02] Brother Ray because he may not know it's
[34:05] me now I'm I'm just being Carnival with
[34:07] this he may not know it's me
[34:09] okay but if you put a preacher up there
[34:11] let's preached what's on your mind all
[34:13] week and you haven't talked to the
[34:14] preacher now
[34:16] you got to believe that the preacher
[34:18] caught
[34:19] the spirit from God that's right right
[34:22] amen and then that's what was brought so
[34:25] he's just a conduit God's wanting to
[34:28] bring you something and he says okay I'm
[34:29] going to bring it right through here and
[34:32] how much more do you rejoice
[34:35] same way here when we Rejoice here when
[34:38] we go upstairs and I don't finish a
[34:39] statement or somebody has a question in
[34:41] your mind and you don't even ask me the
[34:42] question you you said why would you
[34:44] cover that better I have a question
[34:45] about that go right upstairs and daddy
[34:47] covers the whole thing
[34:49] that's up to me this morning through his
[34:51] sister the problem I had last night
[34:53] about believing about that and she said
[34:56] Okay
[34:58] figure that you know the day of the
[35:01] Rapture so we're all standing in line
[35:03] and that my name is called and I said oh
[35:06] but I can't go because I'm not you yeah
[35:09] sure
[35:15] hey this is not just for the men
[35:20] now
[35:22] for what happened in the Garden of Eden
[35:25] will not go back to all that but we know
[35:27] that Eve fell from the word of God by
[35:29] believing Satan's life right
[35:32] so a woman cannot preach but now before
[35:34] that man and woman was equal
[35:37] but the double Covenant was the second
[35:40] Covenant that came in God said no from
[35:42] now on you'll be under headship
[35:44] you'll be under your husband and because
[35:46] of what you did and listened to the
[35:48] serpent because what you did you can't
[35:50] preach anymore now you say brother that
[35:52] ain't in the Bible no it's all the way
[35:53] through the Bible that's right
[35:57] that's good
[35:59] woman yeah and let me just be playing
[36:01] with this I want to explain something
[36:03] that was somebody asked brother Jim
[36:05] Pinkston said well well why can't a
[36:08] woman pray
[36:10] and he said well the Bible full from
[36:12] being a man being subject to the wife
[36:13] because of what happened in the garden
[36:15] she can teach and she can teach the
[36:17] Sunday school class and she can be a
[36:19] help just like the sister was there but
[36:21] not a conduit from God because of the
[36:23] double Covenant the man's here the
[36:25] woman's here
[36:26] that's just the way it is now we're
[36:27] going to be restored back when we get
[36:28] over there all right okay but
[36:32] but
[36:34] if you want to go to the levitical
[36:36] priesthood
[36:38] when you take the Levites
[36:41] when you take a female
[36:43] in the Old Testament they couldn't enter
[36:45] the temple
[36:48] for the seven day period
[36:50] of their uncleanness
[36:54] that you women understand what I'm
[36:56] talking about the seven year period that
[36:58] you have every month you couldn't go in
[37:00] a congregation
[37:01] because you were unclean now that's a
[37:04] Time
[37:05] and that's what that's what brother
[37:06] Payson said well what is your what is
[37:08] your preacher do so what does she do you
[37:10] know brother Jim he just big mouth like
[37:12] me he said what is your
[37:15] Pastor Dave when she has that time of
[37:17] the Mind said the Bible says she ain't
[37:18] supposed to be in church
[37:23] yeah he's a lawyer
[37:28] but I don't know how we got on that but
[37:30] but
[37:31] look it's headship though Christ is our
[37:34] head that's right and then we're
[37:36] supposed to be
[37:38] in the body we're supposed to hear from
[37:40] him but then God give us a Ministry to
[37:42] give it to you and then you have a part
[37:44] in this where like I said we're not the
[37:47] great one
[37:49] we're servants we serve
[37:54] song leader you're supposed to serve
[37:56] you're supposed to serve what the people
[37:58] won't know what you want
[37:59] right
[38:00] you're supposed to feel the leading of
[38:02] the Lord and do what the Lord leads and
[38:04] we'll do that
[38:05] we'll have a better time with it let's
[38:07] read Hebrews 11 and then we're going to
[38:08] give you this point and then we'll go
[38:09] chapter 11 Hebrews 11 verse 1.
[38:14] now Faith is the substance that word
[38:17] substance means actual
[38:20] existence
[38:21] all right
[38:23] so now Faith is the actual existence of
[38:27] things hoped for
[38:30] the fish can't have fins and swim in the
[38:35] water unless there's
[38:37] water
[38:38] it's got to be water there
[38:40] right you can't have a desire for a
[38:43] steak
[38:44] if there's no such thing as a steak
[38:47] same thing as far as far as our desires
[38:51] there's got to be a substance there so
[38:54] the substance is the Holy Ghost
[38:56] to me that's the most important thing is
[38:58] the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost and
[39:00] you'll you'll either it says it is the
[39:03] earnest of your inheritance
[39:05] like I said with the ocean Ocean's full
[39:08] of 90 different elements
[39:11] if you take one little speck one drop of
[39:15] water from the ocean and put it on this
[39:16] table you've got the same 90 elements
[39:21] as the water in the ocean
[39:23] if that is the water in the ocean that's
[39:25] not a substitute that is the substance
[39:28] right but there's a whole ocean of water
[39:31] out there
[39:32] but to have a substance of the ocean
[39:35] then you have the ocean
[39:37] right you have the ocean if you've got
[39:39] those 90 elements so if you've got the
[39:41] Holy Ghost you've got everything God
[39:43] wants to give you
[39:45] but what happens
[39:47] our flus get stopped up that's right we
[39:50] stop God you say stop God yes sir you
[39:52] will yes ma'am you will you will stop
[39:56] God how many have ever stopped God oh
[39:59] 100 okay all right just want to make
[40:01] sure I was on the right track here now
[40:03] Faith is the substance of things hold
[40:04] for the evidence
[40:06] of things
[40:08] how many have you seen Jesus in flesh
[40:14] literally in his Corporal body
[40:20] hold your shin out there just a little
[40:21] bit further
[40:22] literally in flesh how many of you seen
[40:24] Jesus how many have you seen Donald
[40:26] Trump
[40:29] so what we got to do
[40:31] we gotta have faith that's right that
[40:34] there was a Jesus yes and then you did
[40:36] die on a cross we never saw it
[40:38] physically that's right so faith is the
[40:40] substance but we know what happened
[40:41] because the substance is there we can
[40:43] believe that that's right he did it he
[40:46] died in the mind of God before the
[40:47] foundation of the world the Bible said
[40:49] but he had to literally
[40:50] bring that to pass on the earth so we
[40:52] could believe things
[40:54] that we don't see but is it a substance
[40:57] absolutely
[40:59] absolutely if he didn't die on that
[41:02] cross and if he wasn't here 2000 years
[41:04] ago
[41:04] we're just yakking our lips off for no
[41:08] reason at all but we got to believe that
[41:10] that's who he was and that he said what
[41:12] he's going to do
[41:14] Were You There When I wrote this nope
[41:16] but we're living it right now
[41:20] and we do see God in human flesh now but
[41:22] he's in our flesh all right let's go
[41:25] Faith remember talk about faith next
[41:28] Sunday
