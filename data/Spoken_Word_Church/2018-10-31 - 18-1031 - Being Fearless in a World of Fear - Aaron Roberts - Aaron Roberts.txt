holy holy holy I want to see God bless you this evening good to be in the house of the Lord amen some know I may sing later brother Bob somebody get me some water all right is that better that good is that good getting hear me now can you hear me now can hear knew it all right well praise the Lord happy happy to be a Christian today praise the Lord for all that he's done for us amen this is a real interesting interesting day today this is the supposed to be like the most darkest day of the year and you know everybody's supposed to be celebrating the the darkness of the world that we're celebrating the light rejoicing in the light tonight so thank you ready amen so if you have your Bibles tonight let's look in the scripture tonight and kind of want to if I can I want to kind of gear this some of this to the young people tonight and you just you know there's something that that's been on something you know just the Lord shows you things and you know you when you're when you're listening to brother branham there's things that he says it catches your attention and then you hold on to that and for some reason you can't get away from it's just like something you catch that you get that fault and so this one I've been looking at and you know it has to do with tonight you know this is this is Halloween and when you look at the historical part of what Halloween's about and those things you know one of the things that you find out when when you look at Halloween is one of the that one of the definitions or one of the sayings about as it's called the celebration of fear and you know it's all about fear and you know everything has to be haunted and spooky and you know fear and fright and all these different things you know and you know you know there was a there was a time in history when when there was a lot of darkness and a lot of blackness but you know in the midst of that God sent a man to bring forth light and if I don't I don't know if y'all know this but you know today is the day of the beginning of the Protestant Reformation today is the day that Martin Luther nailed the 95 theses to the door he wrote the 95 theses and you know he blasted the Catholic Church for their stance on many different things which was today and you know you know here was a man that living in a world full of darkness and yet God sent him to bring the light and you're less than one of the things that I want to look at tonight my title is called being fearless in a world of fear and that's what I won't look at tonight because you know God called us to be fearless to be faithful to have faith in what he said and not and not cower to the to the things of the world but you know they're out celebrating a lot of a lot of these darkness but you know what God sent light to us amen so tonight as we look to the scripture we just want to speak to the author before we start reading our scripture so let's just all bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight Lord we just thank you for all that you've done for us Lord for it no matter what goes on in the world Lord Lord the the scripture tells us in men's hearts will be failing for fear but Lord Lord you sent us a word Lord you sent a word to us to encourage us Lord to show us the things that were going to take place in order to not be afraid not to listen to what the devil has to say Lord but to look to you and to see what you have for us and we we know that your word is yeah and amen and father we pray tonight you just come and help us Lord take these thoughts Lord I can't I can't do it in myself lord I just pray that you just come and help us Lord speak to the people tonight Lord Jesus and we just pray that you just meet each need that's represented in this building tonight Lord you know what's on each heart and what's in each life Lord we just commit it to you and just pray that you just anoint the speaker and the hearers tonight we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen second Timothy chapter one and verse seven says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God who has saved us and called us to an holy calling not according to our works but according to his purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but has now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who have abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel we're in - I am appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which calls also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for on whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day and one other scripture I said first John 4:18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love any man you may be seated I was I was looking some time back you know this is a this is a second time I've got to preach on a Halloween here at the church you know them to know what God has done in our day to know what - see what God has done and to know what God has done and what God is doing and why do you what he's going to do to know the whole plan from the beginning to the end and you know one of the things I love about what what Paul's writing to Timothy here because you know he lays it down I think so perfect is that you know he said I'm not ashamed we shouldn't be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord we shouldn't be ashamed of what God has done to know what God has done he said he said they saved us and called us to a holy calling not according to our works and I'm so thankful for that for every day because it's not my works but it's but it's him but according to his own purpose and grace which have given us in Christ Jesus before the world began and I'm so glad that you know it's already been settled before it ever started you know so I mean we we live in a world that is engulfed in fear and you know everything that that this world is about is about fear you know we're in the in the political realm and the political time now and you know everything everybody's so worried about what's going to take place but you know it's one group is you know they're trying to press on people's emotions working on people's emotions about what's going to take place and you know you get these you get these flyers in the mail you get emails you know we got to stop this group from doing this and we got to stop that group from doing that well then when you when you step back and look and the in the great scheme of things you realize you know God has his hand in all of this and we know what's going to take place so it doesn't matter which group gets in it's still going to come out to the same end just like they say it's rearranging the deck furniture on the Titanic we know what the end results going to be it doesn't matter who does what it's still going to come out the same way but you know everybody is dealing on you know there it's just a fear-mongering you know it's just working on everybody's emotions everybody's so fearful of what's going to take place well you know what it doesn't matter what takes place because if you're a child of God you know what's going to take place because you know what we're one aware if we're he is then you know what he knows what's going to take place and he's already got a plan and a purpose for us and it doesn't matter what takes place you know when it just like Joe but he was laying on there on the ash heap and all the things that he went through you know he stood there and said though God slay me yet I'll trusting you know all the things that job had to go through in his life and all the things that he suffered and everything you know what he put his trust in God and you know God came and spoke to him and showed him who he was and you know where were you when when the morning star saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy we're worried you well you know what that's the same question for you and I where were you you know because if we if we come from the mind of God and we're going back to the mind of God then you know what we're in the mind of God today and so the steps every step that you take you the scripture tells us that it's ordered of the Lord even when you mess up you know what if you're a child of God he's coming for you why because you know he don't allow you to sin and an act unbecoming of a Christian without him coming and chastising you he brings you back to where you need to be and you know that's the same thing you know we have to have we have faith and have and have a reassurance that we know who we are and you know the devil won't doesn't want you to to let you know to believe that and see who you are and the the quote that I want to read is from the this is from the seal of the Antichrist in 1955 and brother Branham says so now the day that we're living in is the question mark over the entire world he said I've traveled a great deal of the world for the Lord and in there not only in America but everywhere if there's an unsettled peace everywhere the whole world seems to be shaking it scared like something's fixing to happen well that shows something is fixing to happen he said where don't want to scare you I'm not here to do that I'm here to show you a way to keep from being scared and not to scare you but we must face facts and we might and we must do that we must so we find out that over the world there is great fear sitting upon all peoples in this Atomic Age when it's just ready for everything to happen and me and he says and he skips down he talks about the church's cooling off and and the different things he says men come in anointed of the Holy Ghost they preach with everything that's within them and the people walk walk right out and walk away as if nothing had ever happened just unconcerned he said there's got to be a reason for that and if you'll study this this tells us what the reason it do you know that the scripture says there will be a time in the last days when there be a famine strike the land not for bread or water but for hearing the Word of God and that men would go from east west north or south seeking to hear the word of God and fail to find it just think of the times we're living in and we're living in that time I believe when the prophets spoke that he foresaw the United States of America because it's the only place that I know of would meet that description in this day and so this is this is the day that we're living in that great fear is upon the world but he said I don't want you to be afraid I don't want you to be fair but we got to see the facts but you know it was so interesting that he said you see the day and hour that we live in but he but you know brother Branham goes right to the scripture and he says what's the problem why is there fear in the land why is there such fear on the people because he said there will be a famine in the land he said not for bread or for water but for hearing the Word of God so what is it when you're not in the word then there's fear upon the land because they turned the word down so that's why there's the only place to have hope to have faith is in the word and if it's not in that then we are living in fear we live in fear many people live in fear you know they're so bound by so many things but you know it's for us to hold on and believe what God sent us you know the world is so full of fear everything everything is controlled by fear you know it's it's just even in your subconscious realm when you don't even realize what people are saying to you they're they're sowing seeds in your mind to be fearful what is it what is it today tell me something you know watch if you get on YouTube if you've ever you know you get on something like YouTube and every so often and they run these old commercials about stuff you buy a magazine and they don't matter what kind of magazine it is if you get in a magazine the first thing they won't do is I want to have these full-page advertisements and what is it full-page advertisements they're trying to sell you something but what you you go in there and you start looking at them and what's the first thing they want to do do you have a tree watery eyes do you have heartburn do you have this do you have that do you have this problem that does this bother you no no no but you know what is it doing is someone something into your mind but people but what is it the first thing they do say well just happen they want to give you all these symptoms do you have these symptoms well if you have any of these symptoms talk to your doctor and what do they do well I don't know maybe I do and you know what in the next person yeah and then all of a sudden you know they said well you know what I didn't feel like that last week but you know this week I'm starting to feel like that and you know I read that advertisement you know they said you know if you have these symptoms this could be the problem or the news comes on and they start telling everybody well you know what they have this disease that are that's attacking kids and putting them in the hospital and the CDC can't figure out what's wrong with it and it's flu-like symptoms well you know what there's plenty of hyper contracts in the world that moms are out there and the first time their kids end up with the sniffles you know what they start thinking that's what their kids have we got to take we got to take a little junior off to the doctor because he might have that disease at the CDC ain't figured out what it is there's like no Junior just got the sniffles but what is it it's sowing something into your mind that people feed on that and every little thing that happens somebody's like well I don't know I don't know about that and so you know it just continually grows you know there's there's people in the world they say well they say well I'm normal but you know what that stays in the back of your mind and you feed on that and the devil's like you know what you're coughing now you have this problem your foot hurts you know it's just like me I had one kidney stone and I didn't think I was ever gonna get over there I think the Lord I got had to have surgery to have it removed and I think the Lord I got rid of it but you know this week I've been hurting on this side right here and just pain best up high and you know it's what the devil tell been telling me every single day you got a kidney stone you've got a kidney stone you've got a kidney stone it's like well you know what I ain't got a kidney stone hain't got a kidney stone but you know I don't go around telling everybody you know what how you do it well I'm hurting in my back right there you know what y'all are the first person to know that's been my back's been hurting I ain't told anybody but tonight but you know what the devil says you got a kidney stone you got a kidney stone that's what no I probably got a I probably done something move the wrong way hurt my back somehow but you know the devil you know because you know the one thing I don't want to have to ever have to go through and I don't want any of y'all ever have to go through so have a kidney stone if you ever had a kidney stone you know I'm talking about but you know the devil he's right in your ear all the time kidney stone kidney stone kidney stone but you know what you got to resist the devil and he'll flee from you but you know so many times we see people that you know the whole world is is so-and-so brother I'm said is such a neurotic state and everybody is so bound by fear and you know all all of these fears and worry and anxiety you know the the world is so in such a turmoil you know brother brems said that psychiatrists or doctor in the psychiatrist which you know to me that makes me feel makes me reassured about going to a psychiatrist you know he's like oh this medicine works real good I thank it myself you know I don't know you know just weird you know it don't build any confidence you know but you know we said we see these sanction and you know what one of the things that brother Brent them talked about and I want to talk about a little bit tonight is you know there's a there's a word called phobia and a lot of people knows word about about phobias and a phobia is an anxiety disorder that a person develops and usually it has an irrational basis to it and sometimes it has an irrational circumstance to it you know you know there's people that worry about things happening that you know you're really not likely for it to happen to you but you know people they get these things in their mind you know a lot of people you know you know very common phobias people have is you know people are you know they're afraid of snakes they're afraid of heights they're afraid of spiders you know there's a lot of different things you know people are afraid of being in and confined spaces and you know all these different things well you know when you start when you start looking at things in people's life you know and you start looking at some of these things yeah I'm convinced that people in the world are scared of everything there are people that have a phobia because you can go online and start reading about phobias and honestly I think people are have a phobia to everything that you can think of there are there are people that just they are absolutely terrified of things that have no rational basis for it to happen but you know they are they get so right I mean there are some people that are so afraid of something taking place that you know they don't want to leave their house and you know there are certain and and you know I just want to read you here's us a few things that that just just reading these links and and you think about these these phobias that people have and you wonder you know it doesn't make any sense you know there was there was a lady that I was reading about a young lady she wanted to be a schoolteacher and she couldn't be a schoolteacher and one of the reasons why she never could be a schoolteacher is because she's a she as she has a phobia to cotton to cotton balls to anything white and fluffy if it's not even if it's polyester or anything like that if it's a cotton ball she can't even pull the cotton ball out of a aspirin bottle she's all bundled up and using forceps or tweezers to pull the cotton ball out of the aspirin bottle because she can't touch it and you know what's so amazing these people realize that this is irrational there's absolutely no basis for this but you know what they still believe that there are people in this world that are afraid of wood there are people in this world there are afraid of synthetic fibers if you put if you've got somebody close to a piece of polyester they would absolutely pass out I mean oh you know and you know what's so amazing is when you look at some of these things and you start reading people are afraid of the color yellow they don't want anything anything to do with the color yellow number the number thirteen people people will actually run the other way from the number thirteen I thought when they were talking about number thirteen that's like if you have any cash if the serial number has 13 in it you want to get rid of it I will leave you of your phobia I will leave you of your stress we are here to help you I will help you out with that people people are people are are they are scared of the number eight they are there everything honestly Pete anything that you honestly anything that you can think of people have a fear of and it's in a SOAM I mean honestly there was there was one there was one person they couldn't they couldn't touch anything anything ahead that was slimy anything slimy that they felt was it was a little bit slimy has a certain feel to it it just freaks them out so they said lotion or hint and sanitize or anything like that just freaks them out you think you think that you think that people I mean there are people in the world that that absolute can't handle these things and you know what's so amazing these people woke up and you know they absolutely know this as irrational but you know what that fear to them is more real than you or sitting in that chair that fear to them is more real you know what if you put something if somebody had a phobia and they were and they hated the color yellow you could have put a cobra in the room with them and something yellow and they would go over there to the cobra that's get away from the yellow it wouldn't matter what I mean people would run out in front of a train to get away from some of these things and they know that it's irrational is there's nothing behind it and you know what I thought what I was thinking about all this you know we can come to the house of God we can hear the word preach and you know what we will sit and listen and live in a world that we are bound by things that the devil is created and put in our minds that are irrational that's contrary to the Word of God and you know what we will still believe in it we will live in a world that this devil has created in our minds and Ren believe it and walk in it when the Word of God said that we are creators we create you know what we can't change the environment in which we live but you know what we create the atmosphere in which we live we create the atmosphere well because you know what we are many creators but you know what those people they live in something that's created in their mind that they believe that that is real yeah just like tonight everybody's out trick-or-treating and all these different things and they're living in a world that don't and they don't even realize that this is nothing but demonic powers in a way that the devil can get to you simple things just like watching video games and playing this and that and not realizing the underlying forces behind it you know years ago I took a class in college that had to do with theatre and movies it was a general ed class and you know one of the things that I thought was so amazing when I started watching all these different movies was people didn't realize the things that Hollywood put in movies as far back as the 30s and the 40s and what's so amazing is when you sit and watch these videos and all of a sudden these people start bringing these seeds out and you start saying here's a little pinch of this and a little piece of that and a little piece of this and you know what he got past the censors and you know it was so amazing if you go back and watch movies from years ago there is no if you and I would just sit down and watch it and had no concept of what was going on you would never ever ever realize there's a homosexual spirit in them you would never you would never pick up on it but as soon as somebody brings that first scene out and shows you something and say this was what year this came out and you catch the spirit behind that and this is a university showing this and all of a sudden you start seeing this and this and this and all of us said people people wonder why brother Bentham talked about he said it wasn't juvenile delinquency he it was parent delinquency but you know what they were certain things that was sewed in the movies years ago this sowed seed into people's minds that automatically people started to believe certain things and it was in your subconscious you didn't even realize it you know red Ram said you don't go on The Devil's ground he's a real slicker he'll get past you you won't catch it and people say well you know it's okay it's okay well the next thing you know you know just like he talked about one generation came along and you know they've done these certain things and then you know it was the girls and then you know he talked about the flappers and you know the different ones as they came along the girls you know this one done this one and this one done that one and all of a sudden you start to see the the moral decay of the women how they started to change all these things that took place and people didn't realize what was taking place in in them in the movies and TV and there were times that even they were showing us in this in this class censors would stand up and say you can't put that on TV and they said sure we can said it's here's your book and we don't break any of your rules but those people could see those sensors could see the spirit behind that stuff he could hate they could see it they said what we didn't break your rules and you know what it was put on TV see people you know sometimes we let things we don't because if we're not vigilant of what we're doing things catch our attention and we get fascinated or fixated on things and not realizing how much they're destructive and we catch sane and you know we think well it's not going to hurt yeah it can't hurt it gets your attention it catches you and we have to we have to be vigilant on what what's going on around us we have to be we have to be always mindful of the word and and keep our eye on him that we know what the devil is trying to do to us but you know many times people have come and they have missed what God's trying to do and I want to try to try to find these right quick but you know brother branham there's a there's a few times that brother Brown was talking about people having just wanted to share these with you but you know there's there's three different times I know brother brown talks about somebody having a phobia and you know one time he talks he calls a lady out and he and he tells about her and he said you have a phobia to wintertime he said he said you know you get depressed and you have all these different things happen to you because of the winter and he said you know you get depressed and all of these things and then another time he talks about a man he said he kept saying his mom's face in front of him and you know he said you have this phobia that's causing this you know he calls these people out in different you know and I just want to share that with you because you know it's amazing how them how many different types of phobias that people have and all these different things that happen to people and how people get bound by things that you know they don't even they don't even really they don't even want but you know what they've allowed the devil to have access in to allow these things to happen in their lives but God will has a way for us to to overcome this is from the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he said when Jesus was here on earth you know he was a manual we all believed that he wasn't just a prophet he was God manifested in flesh and when he was here on earth all the powers that the father had given him everything that was in him he was Emmanuel God in Christ reconciling the world to himself when he met Satan he never used any of his powers he used the word of God he said Satan said if thou be the Son of God I want you to perform a miracle here so I can see you do it see that's still the attitude of Satan let me see you do something make this man to walk and you perform a miracle and turn these stones to bread he said jesus said it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that cometh out of the mouth of God I see when he when he took him up on the pinnacle of the mountain and he says the angel is written he'd give you you give the angels charge over you lest any time you dash your foot against a stone they said jump up here he said he took him up on the mount and set him set him down he rebuked him again with the word defeated Satan with the Word of God showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with us say if the Lord it is written it is written he said remember that my friend he says but you just put your faith in the word and believe that it's God's Word and you can beat Satan anywhere anytime if there isn't a preacher in a thousand miles of you you can still whip Satan around on the Word of God so everything that we try to do we must it must come from the word or it's not right to me see it must come this is the foundational truth of God so we need to stay with the word and hold on to what the word has to say because you know Jesus used the word and that's what the believers are supposed to use the same thing is to use that use the word and from the message expectation brother Branham says he said but goes on he said don't talk take a subject on expectation now before you can have expectation there must be faith to accompany that expectation and there's only two elements in the world that controls the world tonight that's fear and faith he he says now now fear has no valuation in it nothing whatsoever it's perfectly endless it hasn't got one good thing about it if I was to be shot in the morning was going to be shot what good would it do to have fear what good would it do me you say well what good would faith do me faith could deliver me but fear can't help me a bit you just get yourself all worked up and more nervous than ever when it comes time for the gun to fire so let's have faith faith could deliver me but if it doesn't what good with fear do me would do anyhow just stay right with faith and hold on to it take God's promise and remain with God because you know he said what good was faith do you well you know what they were three Hebrew boys that got cast into a into a fiery furnace and you know that's what they said they said you know we're not going to bow our gods more than able to deliver us and if he don't we still ain't gonna bail and you know what God was so moved by and he honored their face so much that he come and stood in the midst of them you know that that the king when he looked in he saw four of them he didn't just see the three and so you know if we don't have faith you know God can't operate you know he's the high priest of our confession well if you don't have a confession there's nothing he can all that he can intercede on but you've got to be a Hopf you know for him to be the high priest you've got to have a confession you've got to have a confession of what he said that you believe what he said because you know many times we hear people and you know you know they want to believe you know they say well I wish that was true or you know I wish I could do something well you know the thing is just like he says well you know what would happen if you did you know what would happen if you did you know it's just like somebody that that's bound with with some sort of that one of these phobias and you know the way they treat this is you know they you have to get in your mind that this is this is irrational and that that you know there's no harm in this but you know there's people they have to get they first have to get that in their mind and they made they make that conscious effort and then the second thing is is you actually have to go in a private to show that it's not harmful you know somebody that doesn't you know that that's afraid of the color yellow you know the first thing they have to do is realize you know and say that's not harmful to me there is no harm in that and then you know what they can go out and touch that and then they can move forward you know over time they get to the place where you know they can overcome that and it's the same thing with you and I we have to come to the place that we have to put our faith in the Word of God and say you know what this is what God said because many times people we let that we let the devil say things to us and beat us up and beat us down and then you know we wonder why we can't have victory we can't have Joel we can't have these different things why because we've allowed the devil to beat us up we've a listen to the devil and you know when we say well what can I do about it well the first thing you can do about it is he's first thing you got to do is believe what the word says you've got to have the right mental attitude you've got to have the right mental thought and if you can get the right mental thought if you can think it and not just thinking but then you got to speak it you've got to say what the word says and it and if we can and then if we can believe what the word says and we can say the word then you know what it's not just saying that I'm healed but you know what it's it's to get up and think you know what I'm gonna move on because you know what the devil's not gonna make me this way people sit in there and think well you know what I'm laying in the bed and I'm sick and you know and then we just lay there and say well bye stripes I'm healed we're going to watch then it's time you can say that mean times sometimes it's time to get or put our feet on the floor and get out of the bed you know the thing is is ways you know when the devils beat you down to whatever it is that you're facing that you're fighting when you get up then you you have to you have to think that whatever it is what the word says whatever whatever whatever you have Neeta first you get up and you have to think what the word says then you have to speak the word then you've got to whack down it you've got to move well because if you never act on it then it won't ever come to pass one because when when you think well I think if you have a you have a financial need and you know you you have you don't know how you can pay your bills well you know what they said my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory well the first thing I got to do I got to get it between my ears and then I got to speak it well then the next thing you know I go to work and you know what I have the right mental attitude about going to work and you know what sometimes the thing is you go and earn the first thing you do is say boss you got any extra work for me yeah well you know what sometimes I buy my job they told us I had a boss that said how much overtime can we work he said as long as you're not here twelve hours a day seven days a week he said it's okay but you know the thing is is some people don't want to don't want to do it well you know I punch you in before tea and I won't help well you know sometimes it's when we go to work and you know all of a sudden we get we can work overtime then we can Matt we have the money it's like well I worked my forty hours I'll punch you out then I go home and wait for the Lord to drop it in my lap well sometimes the Lord blesses us with overtime some people don't want to don't see it that way you know it's so it's so amazing that you know you find these kids and they talk about not being able to find a job and well I want to do this and I'm gonna do that I tell them I said can you hold a screwdriver you know I started I start you know I started working in air conditioning you know I didn't I didn't know the first thing about air conditioning but you know I'd already worked I'd already been to school for electronics so I know how to electronics work so when I went in there's a lot of things that when it comes to the electrical part of air conditioning I had that thing knocked that I didn't they started bringing me stuff like I got all this I got all but I just had to learn how refrigeration worked well I went in you know I didn't I didn't know how that thing work but I started work I started learning about it but you know there's kids they can't tell you the first thing about anything and it you know the thing is is there's people in the world that that's made millions of dollars and you know what they've had and they've had an idea and they acted on it you say what I want to do this I want to do that well you know what you're never gonna do that sitting on your rear end warming up you ain't never gonna get you know we're warming a scene ain't never gonna get you anywhere you know there's people out there looking for help all the time you know what if you show up every day and you got a good attitude you can do anything in the world if you're willing to learn there's people out there willing to teach but you know what there's a lot of people that don't don't do that and you know everything that you have and your and your life that whatever you're facing you know the thing is the devil tells you you're not smart enough you're not good enough you don't look good enough whatever you're never gonna measure up or whatever else the devil tells you're gonna watch your right you're never gonna measure up but you know what the thing is we're not looking at his yardstick we're looking through the blood of Jesus Christ and if we look through the blood of Jesus Christ and you know what we're not sure we're not anything that you know one because if we see we're not brother madam said we're not looking at ourselves he said we're looking at him because if we look through the blood see God's not looking at us he's looking at he's looking at the sacrifice he said he's looking at Christ and if Christ was the perfect one then guess what you're perfect through him but the other thing is is are you do you believe that do you believe what God said do you believe what God has said in his word whatever you have need of if you say not if brother Dale says it or somebody else or mama or daddy says it he said but if you say to this mountain the thing is is people you know kids wonder about how old they have to be if you're old enough to think and old enough to speak then you're old enough to put the devil on the run you don't have to be I have to wait till I'm 13 or 14 or I have to have this or that no if you and if you can speak to God God can speak to you but you know there are kids in the world that think you know they have they can't ever measure up you know and they let the devil beat on and you know what they start out at eight nine ten years old and the devil has beat into them until the time that when they get to be teenagers you know what they don't ever think they'll ever measure up and you know the other thing that happens with kids is when kids come along they have parents who have Saudi seeds in their minds that they just continue to grow that you know what they cultivate a thinking of failure and they wonder whether kids fail they wonder why their kids can't make it one because if you don't tell your kids who they are and if you're not praying over your kids and telling them who they are then you know I don't never come to to where they need to be but it's always what we what we put in our kids but the thing is is is is no matter how young you are if you can believe what God says then it can come to pass if we can believe all things are possible he didn't say all things are possible to certain ones he said all things are possible to them that believed you know if it's in our what's in our minds can we believe that do you believe that can you do you walk in that hey mercy can you come up here for a minute would you come up here for a minute you don't have to be afraid I'm not going bearish you don't come here around I think she got a great smile oh come here come here come over here come on you don't like being up here do you know well you know what I want you don't thank you for doing this but I want you to look it up out there see all those people and what you think you see all those people up there now you're afraid about there but you know what I want you to know one thing that everybody in this room loves you and don't you I want you to look at every face in this room and that's the face of love you know if you think you know these people love me and you know what they'd do anything for me then you know what it gets less scary up here than it that you know all these people they love you and do anything in the world for you and you know what they want you to succeed they want you to be the best that you can be and you know what you can be why because God said you could and you know what I have something for you you believe I'll give you something I want to give you something for coming up here tonight if I can find it look at it but you know what when you do something and you know things take place in your lives and I want you to know one son I got a little something for you but I want you to know when I called your name from back there you didn't even realize it but when you got up out of that chair and you said yeah you come up here and find everybody I want you to know this this was already yours and you didn't even know it was yours I won't give that to you what is it that's a $20 bill but you know what you didn't even realize back there that $20 long do you did you but you know what when you look at the Word of God when we see it it says I have not seen nor ears have heard neither has it entered into the heart of man what God has installed and you know what just like this right here he said we have to come to him as a child right and if we can come as a child just like mercy come up here she trusted me enough to come up here she didn't know what she was expecting when she came up here but you know what she trusted me and you know what all of us said you were so scared about what was going to take place but you know what I want to tell you one thing you're fearless you know because you had fear but you know what you overcome that fear to come up here it made you fearless and I want you always remember one thing you're fearless no matter what the devil comes at you with you're fearless why because you're one of us you're fearless thank you if we can come the same way tonight yeah I know the rest of you would come us reason I chose mercy because because she'd know what Mercy Mercy she doesn't like being at fear she's she's kind of scared of being up here and that's the reason I come to pick her why because that's something she had to overcome thanks a lot of people in this building boy they just skipped up here they had jumped up here that's not a problem but you know some people they have to overcome something but you know if we come the same way just like she did how many times his brother Dale told us when we got out of our pews to come up for hair for prayer he said it was settled when you walked out of that people brother branham tells the story of the man that come to him and you know he was selling cars and somebody stuck a note in his pocket said where were you spend eternity and he said he went from that point and he started going from church to church and speaking to different one spoke to Billy Graham and different churches and went different places and you know he said it never was settled it never was settled until he come somebody seen him - brother Branham and he said it's already settled he said what do you mean he said the first time you picked that track up and you read that where would you spend eternity and he said you turned and started walking toward God that's where it was settled and brothers and sisters that's how simple it is and young people that's how simple it is you think the devil wants to make things complicated in your life but you know that's how that's how simple God is if we complete you know people say I want to receive the Holy Ghost well you know what the bow brother Branham says that he said he wants to give it to you more than you want it for yourself if you can believe that whatever you're looking for whatever you have need of whatever it is that you're facing and you know the thing is is we you have a whole church family and many and you know I want all the young people to know that you have a family and it's not it's not who you're sitting on the pew with that is your family all most I guess most of you have the same last name you know makes your mom and dad and everything but I want you know this is your church family and you know the thing is is we all want you to succeed and succeed ain't having money and and it's good to make great grades but you know that ain't that ain't all that there is in the world but don't don't think that brother Aaron says I can be a slacker because I'm not we're not we're not we're not letting anybody be underwater in here if you don't you know what that means it means you're under sea level you know we don't have nobody I can't get a boat do the best you can but let me tell you something I want you to be all that you can be in Jesus Christ be all you can be in God's army being the army of God let's be all that we can be let's do all that we can do we can lo we can allow fear to hold us but you know what God doesn't want us to live like that this is from the message possessing the gates of the enemy I just want to read a couple of quotes here and then I'm gonna dis me the most stop hiraman this is from the message the possessing the gates of the enemy after trial mister from 1964 it's no what you I want you to listen to this he said I wish I had more time to get to more heroes but I got about ten minutes now look at these precious heroes as they were and great worries of faith they all died at the gate of death they all perished right at the gate of death he said then come along the royal seed of Abraham they were all the natural seed of Abraham from Isaac but here come the royal seed of Abraham which was Christ Abraham's seed of faith what we're supposed to be just see how whether we are or not the natural seed only was a type all others was born of natural birth but he come a virgin birth see that wasn't of the seed of Abraham then a Jewett come by the seat of faith of the promise and then we're supposed to be his children through this man I said watch what he did when he was on earth he conquered it possessed every gate the enemy had the royal seat he promised it by the word he conquered it he conquered the gate of sickness for us that's what he come to do he remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it the other men had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness and what did he do when he conquered the gates of sickness saying that he would whatsoever you ask on earth whatever you bind on earth he would mind it in heaven give us the keys to the gate he conquered the gate of temptation by the word and the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all conquered every sickness he conquered death and he conquered hell and he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because there of the natural seed this is the spiritual seed he conquered the great the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and now we're more than conquerors we're just to walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors I see lost my place now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sicknesses defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my wish I was twice my size now maybe I feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy if you can believe that that you are you are I mean it's he's conquered he's already defeated and you're disputing with somebody that that doesn't even have keys to his own house that's already defeated and he wants to argue with you over what's taking place but he's already been defeated but here come the royal seat of Abraham which was Christ Abraham's seed of faith what we're supposed to be whether we are or not the natural seed was only a type all others were born of natural birth but he come the virgin birth see that wasn't the seed of Abraham than a Jew I think we're reading the same thing I just passed over that anyway he goes and 2,000 years later skip down read the wrong in the wrong spot anyway here he comes among us this afternoon identifying himself the mighty Conqueror amen he is still here alive indicating his promise royal seed of Abraham and then we go to the neck when is god's covenant with Abraham and his seed Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it a man based solely upon the finished works of Christ of Calvary every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer when you become a Christian God gives you a checkbook in there with God's name signed at the bottom of it for every for anything you got need of while we're in life's journey are you afraid to cash it amen fill it out and send it to the headquarters and see what God will do about it amen he says well if I know there was deposited enough his blood is sufficient for what he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with His stripes we were healed it's already deposited at Calvary and sickness is an attribute of sin and when we when you touch sin you've got to touch sickness amen and he says the same word this speaks of saved as both translated both ways and he continues on down and that so he skips a little bit and we go down to the last last one this and you can read this later but Jesus contantly constantly fear not fear not I am he that was dead in life forevermore fear not fear not I am with thee always back to the end of the world fear not and the Christian keeps sitting back saying oh I just wonder oh my turn loose amen get all get all the things away from you say mister Satan you are defeated Jesus Christ stripped you of every power you had when when he died at Calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and you can't Bluff me amen I'm made of stuff that don't Bluff that's that's come from Calvary hallelujah don't Bluff it go receive it and I believe that this even so let's all stand this evening that's what I want y'all to know tonight young people I want y'all to say that over and over and over let's all say that together I'm the stuff that don't Bluff say that I'm the stuff they don't Bluff I'm the stuff that don't Bluff you're disputing with a conquered enemy he come to Bluff II you know why you know what because if he could actually do something he wouldn't be a bluff you know a bluff is somebody that can do anything you know there's a song that says nothing can touch me that doesn't pass through his hands it doesn't matter what you know what we face trials we face problems and heartaches and everything like it but you know what God's the one that knows it comes our way there's nothing that comes that befall you that takes God by surprise and you know what we can glory in our problems if we know how to do that brother Branham said that you know we can we can go the right way you know we can conquer and do the things if we're pointed in the right direction you know the thing is that we got to get our mind in the right direction and then we can overcome so when we say we're going to glory in our infirmities well you know what we're not going glory and just sit around and say well I'm doing this for the honor and glory of the Lord no we're going to do it because you know what something's come our way and God's made us more than conquerors to overcome it you know life life has brought things in each one of our lives that we don't want and we don't like but you know what God put them in our lives for our perfection we inherited things that we have to deal with and you know what God give them to us to make us who we are and you know we can we can overcome them or we can make mountains out of mole hills and some people that's you know that's the way they do they sit behind something and so well you know if I didn't have this problem if I didn't have that problem I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to do this I wouldn't be able to do that you know if if we sit down and we start to look in our lives and we see the things that happen you know there's people that's got them a lot worse than we do you know there's though a little story about the man says you know it's complaining about not having any shoes till he met the man didn't have any feet and we we see all the things that that come our way that that happens to us but you know what God has brought these things in our lives to make us who we are and you know the thing is is God made you if you're a child of God then he made you to who you he wanted you to be he molded you and made you in His image that you can come well you know if the thing if if he started this and in the scripture tells us that if if he if we're justified them that he is justified he said he's also glorified so you know the thing is is if if he's already started if he's already put the seal of God upon you if he's already sealed you then you know what he's planning on doing the finishing the work then then if we come to the place where we have received faith and we've been sealed in at faith then you know what God plans on finishing it then you know what then it's up to you and I to allow him to do that whatever whatever it is in the scripture that he said you're the head not the tail whatever it is that it says in the scripture then you know what that is identifying you then it's up to you and I'd to get out of the way that we can allow him to do that so I won't I want each one of us to to see that because that's what I want I want I want to be just what he wants me to be a man god bless you tonight we sing a song if you ever need 1:42 Jesus amen oh god bless you [Music] wife in mercy his pain Jesus and light of the world will walk [Music] a million diesel I come where the dew drops of
