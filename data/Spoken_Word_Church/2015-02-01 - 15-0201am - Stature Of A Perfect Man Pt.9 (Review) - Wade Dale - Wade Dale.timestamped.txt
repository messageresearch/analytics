[0:05] wow good morning everyone good morning
[0:07] good morning it's a pleasure to be back
[0:09] in the house of the lord again
[0:12] no
[0:12] i think if
[0:14] we're going to read from psalm 96 1
[0:17] through 13.
[0:20] now i think every time you know
[0:22] things happen nasa well
[0:26] all these things are fulfilling god's
[0:28] attributes and our predestination
[0:32] so what happened to us
[0:34] is what god seeing was going to happen
[0:37] so just be thankful that we can get
[0:39] through it
[0:41] so we
[0:42] just thank him for his blessing
[0:45] been coming down upon us
[0:48] let's pray
[0:49] heavenly father
[0:51] we are thankful this morning
[0:53] god for the opportunity
[0:55] lord to come together to worship lord we
[0:58] pray that your holy spirit is abiding in
[1:01] each and every heart
[1:03] father let us pray continually lord and
[1:05] thank you for all that you're doing for
[1:07] us and lordosive did long we ask your
[1:10] blessings to be upon us wherever we are
[1:14] lord
[1:15] there are so many people god that never
[1:17] even look unto you
[1:19] never give thanks
[1:21] love but you
[1:23] never

[1:26] if they would just hold to you
[1:28] god and let us hold your unchanging hand
[1:31] and have love always in jesus christ and
[1:33] we pray
[1:34] amen
[1:37] i'm going to read from psalm 96
[1:41] say unto the lord a new song saying unto
[1:44] the
[1:52] lord declare his glory among the heathen
[1:56] his wonders among our
[2:07] for all the people
[2:08] of the nations are ours but the lord
[2:12] made the heavens
[2:21] give unto the lord o ye kindred of the
[2:24] people give unto the lord glory and
[2:26] strength
[2:36] o worship the lord in the beauty of
[2:38] holiness fear before him all the earth
[2:54] let the heavens rejoice and let the
[2:57] earth be glad let the sea roar and the
[3:00] fullness thereof
[3:11] before the lord
[3:13] here he cometh for he cometh to judge
[3:16] the earth
[3:17] he shall judge the world with
[3:19] righteousness
[3:21] and the people with his truth
[3:23] amen
[3:24] god bless you may be seated
[3:38] amen is that your
[3:40] one of your
[3:41] want to get across the river yes
[3:43] on this side a lot of trouble and
[3:44] heartaches but we cross over there and
[3:47] we'll be all right
[3:49] but to have our visitor with us
[3:51] we always say when you come here one
[3:53] time your visitor you come two times
[3:55] you're part of us because we don't have
[3:57] anything to join or anything like that

[5:12] interpreting and the fun he had while he

[5:35] tommy duty we call him he's in the
[5:38] hospital did he say what was wrong with
[5:39] him or what he has pneumonia pneumonia

[5:45] pray for him that the lord would would
[5:47] touch him and it'll be all right all
[5:48] right anything else
[5:52] so that's just saying open the eyes of
[5:53] my heart as wade comes to minister i
[5:56] hope you're enjoying the series i am and
[5:59] and but you know what was that feller
[6:01] said contrary to popular opinion you
[6:03] know he's saying some things i hadn't
[6:04] thought of you know so that's i'm
[6:07] enjoying it you know so that
[6:10] would
[6:11] help us you know i believe it right so
[6:13] let's just pray and
[6:15] ask the lord to open our eyes
[6:18] to the understanding of god's word right
[6:22] open the eyes of my heart lord
[6:26] open the eyes of my heart

[7:57] you want to see him this morning
[7:59] that word c means what understand all
[8:01] right we can all see we all got good
[8:03] vision
[8:04] but we need to have some spiritual
[8:06] vision
[8:08] some spiritual insight
[8:10] and uh that way i'd rather see that way
[8:12] than than than to be able to see 10 10
[8:16] vision in the natural because you'd see
[8:18] things you didn't want to see
[8:20] amen but in the lord there's not
[8:22] anything that you don't want to see of
[8:24] him
[8:25] good to be in the house of the lord good
[8:26] to have our visitor with us today uh
[8:28] brother david
[8:30] right david yes sir good to have you
[8:31] with us today
[8:33] and uh
[8:34] and uh
[8:36] just pray to say something it'll help
[8:37] you
[8:38] any of us in all of us
[8:40] but uh
[8:41] by way of announcements let's we're
[8:43] gonna
[8:44] i hope we spend less time doing this
[8:46] because downstairs is the announcement
[8:49] um
[8:51] board and it runs the whole time you're
[8:54] here so if you're ever sitting or
[8:55] standing or
[8:56] or are down in the fellowship hall
[8:59] it's going to be continually looping
[9:01] telling us all the way to june so we
[9:03] don't have to i don't say waste time but
[9:06] it is kind of
[9:07] when we have a lot of announcements it
[9:08] wastes a little bit of time to
[9:11] to make these announcements where you
[9:12] can look on down on the board and see it
[9:15] but remember next sunday i'll be at
[9:16] brother joe green so i'll give you a
[9:18] break
[9:19] hopefully we'll get to brotherly
[9:21] kindness this afternoon and that'll be
[9:23] that little break and i hope they'll let
[9:25] me continue on maybe even until until i
[9:27] go to the philippines but remember me
[9:29] also 25 days from the day i'll be flying
[9:31] out
[9:32] going to the philippines
[9:34] for three weeks so keep me in your
[9:35] prayers it's not gonna be a short visit
[9:37] it's gonna be for uh a pretty good
[9:39] length of time so just remember
[9:41] in your prayers and um
[9:44] also i know we also have sick ones among
[9:46] us but we got a crowd today we don't uh
[9:50] couldn't fit hardly any more in so
[9:52] we thank the lord for that
[9:54] that god's let us be able to be a part
[9:56] of this amen to be able to be a part of
[9:59] the economy of god to be a part actually
[10:02] not just be a part of the economy of god
[10:04] but be the economy of god
[10:06] all right so let's turn to second peter
[10:08] one
[10:09] and we're going to continue our study
[10:10] today on the statue of a perfect man
[10:14] lord willing we're going to get to
[10:15] godliness and brotherly kindness i hope
[10:17] you enjoyed last sunday that was really
[10:19] i enjoyed last sunday too
[10:21] uh it's bringing out a lot more to me
[10:23] you know like i said brother joe brother
[10:25] uh bob
[10:26] we've been doing this downstairs and
[10:29] he said man you've been holding back i
[10:30] said no
[10:31] it's just god unfolding more as you go
[10:34] along more and more and and to me you
[10:36] know what that is to me that's a
[10:38] confirmation to me
[10:40] may not be to you but it's a
[10:41] confirmation to me that god's bringing
[10:42] you from one place to another if you if
[10:45] you see something here and then you see
[10:47] more of this because you're never going
[10:48] to exhaust god you're never going to
[10:49] come to the place to where you're going
[10:51] to know more than god does
[10:56] but you can know who god is
[10:58] and remember the bible says and he is a
[11:00] rewarder of them that what diligently
[11:03] seek him all right so we got to be
[11:05] diligent about this so second peter
[11:08] chapter 1
[11:10] verse 1 through 11 and let's pray before
[11:12] we get started just remember the ones in
[11:13] prayer
[11:14] i talked to sister rebecca brother
[11:15] gary's going to try to make it this
[11:17] afternoon he called me tuesday and had a
[11:19] real good day and uh
[11:21] and was testifying of it so we just
[11:23] thank god that
[11:25] that
[11:26] you know he said he would heal us he
[11:28] didn't say he'd do it instantly
[11:33] prayers of the saints
[11:35] we just keep praying okay
[11:36] you pray to that one spot and then you
[11:38] know why it's like brother branham said
[11:39] though
[11:41] you could be healed of cancer and die of
[11:43] cancer a month later but it'd still be
[11:46] god to heal you the first time because
[11:47] satan will never heal you
[11:50] he wants to destroy you so don't you
[11:52] remember one thing for sure if you're
[11:53] ever healed
[11:54] god did it right it does not matter the
[11:56] lord jesus christ took those stripes for
[11:59] you before you even came on the face of
[12:00] this earth right
[12:02] but he knew you'd need it when you got
[12:04] here
[12:05] so let's go to the lord in prayer the
[12:06] heavenly father we pray lord today that
[12:08] you would
[12:09] come among us in a special way as we
[12:11] always say please do not be a bystander
[12:13] lord be an active participant
[12:15] be the one that does the speaking one
[12:17] that does the hearing
[12:18] one that does the listening father and
[12:20] may truly we see you lord may we
[12:22] understand that the day and hour that
[12:25] we're living in requires
[12:27] us to be christians
[12:29] not superhuman but christians to live a
[12:32] good honest christian life
[12:34] and to portray it before others
[12:37] father give us lord our daily bread
[12:38] today be with the ones that are not here
[12:40] the ones that are sick father just
[12:42] continue to bless them may your healing
[12:44] anointing go all the way from the top of
[12:45] their head to the soul their feet father
[12:47] if any be anyone here among us today
[12:50] lord that's sick lord you said that you
[12:52] sent your word and healed them so as the
[12:54] word goes forth father may you quicken
[12:56] it to their heart we can't do anything
[12:58] about that they must accept and let it
[13:00] quicken in their heart that you've
[13:02] already healed them father
[13:04] lord
[13:05] we pray for the missionaries on the
[13:07] foreign fields that you bless them and
[13:08] give them fruit for their labor be with
[13:10] each one today lord just lift us up in
[13:12] spirit
[13:13] and in mind and body lord we asked in
[13:15] jesus name
[13:17] amen
[13:18] second peter verse 1 simon peter a
[13:20] servant and an apostle of jesus christ
[13:23] to them that have obtained so there's
[13:25] something you got to get
[13:27] something you got to get god's not going
[13:29] to bring it to you you got to go get it
[13:31] all right remember even john
[13:33] on the isle of patmos and maybe we'll
[13:35] bring some of this together later but
[13:37] john on the isle of pasmos he had to go
[13:39] get that book from the angel right
[13:42] all right he had to go get the book and
[13:43] eat it the angel didn't just no he had
[13:45] wine free moral agency his free moral
[13:48] agencies went and took the book
[13:50] right and he ate it so to them that have
[13:52] obtained like precious faith with us
[13:55] through the righteousness of god and our
[13:56] savior jesus christ grace and peace be
[13:59] multiplied look at all these adjectives
[14:01] all these words multiplied unto you
[14:03] through the knowledge of god and of
[14:04] jesus our lord
[14:06] according as his divine power have given
[14:08] unto us all things that pertain unto
[14:10] life and godliness so we've been talking
[14:12] about how to live our life and how to
[14:13] live it godly right
[14:15] all right
[14:16] excuse me through the knowledge of him
[14:18] that has called us to glory and virtue
[14:20] whereby are given all right so he's
[14:23] going to give you something if you
[14:24] diligently seek him he's going to give
[14:25] you something all right we're buyer
[14:27] given unto us exceeding there's another
[14:29] one exceeding great and precious
[14:31] promises that by these what these
[14:33] promises that's what he's talking about
[14:34] by these promises you might be partakers
[14:37] of the divine nature that now not your
[14:40] nature that's right your nature is not
[14:42] divine right there's only one divine
[14:44] nature and that's the nature of almighty
[14:46] god
[14:47] satan does not have a divine nature
[14:49] satan has a nature all right and that
[14:51] nature corrupts you so you got to turn
[14:53] that around by the new birth
[14:56] being partakers of the divine nature
[14:59] having escaped the corruption that is in
[15:01] the world through lust
[15:03] so you've escaped something right we
[15:06] just read this and go home
[15:08] i mean look at all these blessings but
[15:11] but peter didn't stop at verse four
[15:13] he said and beside this
[15:16] besides all that verse one through four
[15:18] all that stuff god's given us all those
[15:20] things and besides this giving all
[15:22] diligence in other words here you gotta
[15:23] go you gotta go get it again add to your
[15:26] faith your faith virtue and to virtue
[15:29] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[15:31] and to temperance patience into patience
[15:33] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[15:35] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[15:37] charity and that word in the bible also
[15:39] is love all right
[15:41] and that is not
[15:42] we'll get to it later but that love
[15:45] has nothing to do with filial love right
[15:48] right exactly let's not feel your love
[15:51] feeling your love is your nature that
[15:53] you're dealing with now everybody got
[15:55] that that's filial love agape love is
[15:58] that love that no man can understand
[16:00] unless you're at that place amen all
[16:03] right for if these things be in you not
[16:06] on you not an anointing it's got to be
[16:08] in you and once it's in you
[16:10] what happens it becomes you that's right
[16:13] exactly or you become it right for if
[16:16] these things be in you and abound
[16:19] they make you that you shall neither be
[16:21] barren non-fruitful in the knowledge of
[16:23] our lord jesus christ i was thinking the
[16:24] other day
[16:25] that right there tells you that a
[16:27] christian
[16:29] will never be barren or unfruitful
[16:31] doesn't matter what you go through
[16:32] doesn't matter what you do you will
[16:34] neither be barren nor and fruitful if
[16:36] you will let these things work in your
[16:38] life
[16:39] because look he that lacketh these
[16:41] things is blind now not physically blind
[16:44] but what spiritually blind
[16:46] and cannot see it far off in other words
[16:48] what if what is a far off revelation
[16:51] you can't see revelation okay but he
[16:53] that lacketh these things is blind and
[16:55] cannot see it far off and have forgotten
[16:58] so he's forgot something right that he
[17:00] was purged from his old sins
[17:03] wherefore the rather brethren he's
[17:05] summoned it all up give diligence to
[17:07] make your calling not your pastors not
[17:10] your deacons not your elders make your
[17:12] calling an election sure
[17:15] for if if these things be if you do
[17:18] these things you should never follow
[17:20] right right amen you'll be seated in the
[17:22] lord's blessing and reading the word
[17:24] that's the promise ye shall never
[17:27] fall
[17:31] but we want to start now and want a
[17:32] background
[17:34] even with with a visitor here i like the
[17:36] background anyway
[17:38] because we all need to have this
[17:39] refreshed remember 15 times it's got to
[17:41] be repetition so you've heard it about
[17:43] nine so we're almo we're halfway there
[17:46] you can hear it again
[17:48] but remember bring up the first chart
[17:50] for
[17:51] for some the visitor and for all of us
[17:55] to see that
[17:56] what we're talking about today is not a
[17:59] pyramid
[18:01] religion right that's right
[18:04] but the prophet that came in the end
[18:05] time showed us how that it did connect
[18:09] to the building of the pyramid
[18:11] and that we had to grow up in god
[18:14] that this was more of a mountain than it
[18:17] was a pyramid okay
[18:19] uh the sides you know is this should be
[18:22] a mountain everything was given moses
[18:24] would give him the ten commandments on
[18:25] what on a mountain
[18:26] all right all these jesus was
[18:29] transfigured on what a mountain so we
[18:31] see that god brings people up
[18:34] not that he had to put him up there but
[18:36] in symbolics to show me in you we don't
[18:38] have to go on a mountain to get
[18:40] something
[18:41] we don't have to go stone mountain and
[18:42] get on top of the mountain and sit there
[18:44] and wait on god no he's showing us
[18:46] though that what we have to do is though
[18:48] we have to come out from down here
[18:51] this is all normal this is all the world
[18:53] down here you've escaped that and come
[18:56] up higher in god
[18:57] all right so here is the
[19:00] what peter was giving us he was showing
[19:01] us we had to add to your faith virtue to
[19:04] virtue knowledge knowledge temperance
[19:05] temperance patience patience godliness
[19:07] godless brother kindness
[19:09] and the capstone which is love
[19:11] all right because remember
[19:13] just in background and remember we'll
[19:15] not take it off but remember
[19:17] jesus christ was rejected
[19:20] he was the jesus christ the head of all
[19:22] things right
[19:23] all right so he was rejected
[19:26] when they crucified him on a cross
[19:28] and he didn't go away but he says i'm
[19:30] going to leave and he said they're not
[19:32] going to see me anymore but you're going
[19:33] to see me how are you going to see me is
[19:36] is you're going to grow and have the
[19:38] same virtues that i have right
[19:41] right because remember the christians in
[19:43] antioch were called christians because
[19:45] they were christlike
[19:47] okay
[19:48] you can be religious all the day of your
[19:49] life and die and go to hell the devil's
[19:52] very religious he's hugely religious but
[19:55] the devil can never be a christian
[19:58] he can't be christ he can't be
[19:59] christ-like he can get close but he
[20:01] can't be christ-like like me and you
[20:03] there's no way that satan can have these
[20:05] virtues working like they're working in
[20:07] me and you see to me that's the
[20:09] separation
[20:11] that separates everything this
[20:13] this teaching of the statue of perfect
[20:15] man separates
[20:17] these over here from these over here all
[20:19] right
[20:21] excuse me but you have to before you get
[20:24] into this growth with god
[20:26] you must be justified by what believing
[20:29] on the lord jesus christ
[20:31] that he did die for you not for your
[20:33] neighbor not for your brother but he
[20:35] died for you
[20:36] you're walking in this direction all
[20:38] right may take a little time but i'm
[20:40] gonna background a minute here
[20:42] you're walking in this direction you're
[20:43] doing sin you're smoking you're drinking
[20:45] you're you're cursing you're running
[20:47] around with women you have a lustful
[20:48] spirit because remember the scripture
[20:50] says you have escaped that when you
[20:52] become a christian escape the lust of
[20:54] the world all right so you come this way
[20:56] now what you do is one day something
[20:59] either like
[21:00] happened to me you know god will kind of
[21:02] knock you on the head and knock you down
[21:03] for a minute
[21:04] and say look son i need you to do
[21:06] something different
[21:08] you know what i done i got tired of the
[21:10] way i was living
[21:13] i got tired of the way i was living so i
[21:17] i
[21:18] chose to accept what god give me
[21:23] i chose
[21:24] to accept what god give me
[21:26] i didn't choose it because my daddy was
[21:28] a preacher i chose it because i said god
[21:31] i'm tired i'm done if that's you
[21:34] i'm going to do this
[21:37] and i'm going to walk away so you do a
[21:39] 180 justification means turn away from
[21:42] your sin and begin to walk now you don't
[21:45] leave that
[21:46] evil spirit right here
[21:48] you just leave all those past sins right
[21:51] here
[21:52] amen
[21:53] because when you turn the devil's going
[21:55] with you
[21:57] everybody say amen
[22:00] he did with me
[22:01] he actually came a little more closer
[22:03] than he was before
[22:05] because i because remember you get your
[22:07] sins forgiven and you're justified you
[22:09] turn and you begin to walk in a
[22:12] different way
[22:14] not physically
[22:16] but even emotionally spiritually first
[22:18] thing i've done is come to church that's
[22:20] the first thing you need to do at
[22:21] justification you need to start coming
[22:22] to church
[22:23] because you know what at first you were
[22:25] going to bars and you were going to this
[22:26] and your friends loved you because they
[22:28] did this
[22:29] yeah all right
[22:30] well see i have my friends here at
[22:32] church do this and that's why i come
[22:33] here
[22:34] you can put whatever this is you know we
[22:36] act like christians here
[22:38] all right so that's where i want to be
[22:40] i don't want to be in a bar anymore i
[22:42] don't want to be smoking with my buddies
[22:43] i don't want to be you know whatever so
[22:45] i've turned but that evil spirit is
[22:47] still there
[22:49] motivating me to do the same thing again
[22:51] and you know what i might right amen
[22:54] okay if you're a smoker i never was a
[22:55] smoker but i chewed tobacco i was you in
[22:58] the back i was chewing the back of it
[22:59] well now mine was a special case because
[23:01] god knew it'd take a hard time for me to
[23:02] get rid of it
[23:04] but when i turned and started coming
[23:07] back in this direction
[23:10] that
[23:12] part of me not that part went away
[23:15] yeah now a lot of people didn't brother
[23:17] donny he don't mind me using him brother
[23:18] donny he i believe he went through act
[23:21] uh through the process of justification
[23:23] and he started walking you know what he
[23:24] was walking like this though
[23:29] is that okay that's fine okay he's
[23:31] walking like this
[23:33] right
[23:34] now what changed
[23:37] god didn't remember what he did here
[23:39] right
[23:40] that was gone
[23:41] all right so god's not going to remember
[23:43] that you may remember it and i'll
[23:44] guarantee you your friends are
[23:45] definitely going to remember it
[23:47] because you know what they're going to
[23:48] walk with you and remind you yeah
[23:52] but you got but see that's where you got
[23:54] it's still based on faith you got to
[23:56] believe that god did that
[23:58] and that he can do it
[24:00] and that he will do it so you just say
[24:03] they're gone all right
[24:04] my sins are gone all right so but he's
[24:07] still walking
[24:09] but he's getting convicted every time he
[24:11] does anything like that he puts one in
[24:13] his mouth and goes you know the
[24:14] cigarette starts doing like this
[24:17] and then the lighter won't light
[24:20] then you you know you go find another
[24:22] one you know
[24:24] but you know what that's god though
[24:26] taking you through that step okay i
[24:28] don't know why i'm doing this but i'm
[24:29] going this way anyway we got all day
[24:32] all right so we come through
[24:33] justification
[24:35] and we see that god is just that's why
[24:37] it's called justification you're not
[24:39] just
[24:40] right god is just
[24:42] to forgive you and that puts you on a
[24:45] walk of justification
[24:47] then you come up to sanctification where
[24:50] the unclean spirit
[24:52] goes out of the man
[24:54] he quits he takes that thing for the
[24:56] last time and he says god i'm tired of
[24:57] this he throws it down
[25:00] he says i want that out of me i want
[25:02] that desire gone
[25:05] bible says the unclean spirit goes out
[25:06] of a man right
[25:08] all right that's it sanctification
[25:10] that's cleaned up and set aside for
[25:12] service as we talked about before
[25:14] justification is god picking up a glass
[25:18] thanks for reminding me lord i need one
[25:20] of them
[25:21] i'm picking up a glass it's really dirty
[25:23] but you know what you can use it to
[25:25] drink out of
[25:26] but not at this point right so what god
[25:29] does he picks it up all right that's
[25:30] justification he has taken you
[25:33] from one place to another place and he's
[25:35] going to put you in the service
[25:37] so he's going to what he's going to
[25:38] clean that out right you don't like
[25:41] drinking out of a dirty glass do you
[25:43] god don't like using an unclean vessel
[25:44] either
[25:45] so he cleans that out by what the fire
[25:48] of sanctification what coming to church
[25:50] listening to god's word quit listening
[25:52] to other people's word
[25:53] all right start listening to what god
[25:55] says and forget about what because you
[25:56] know what your friends are gonna you
[25:58] know what
[25:59] absolutely what happened to me my
[26:01] friends became religious
[26:05] i said religious not christians they
[26:07] just all came religious you know they
[26:08] became religious so you know you have to
[26:11] watch that
[26:12] and um you know you still have to watch
[26:14] it but you know you get around people
[26:15] and they start cussing then they find
[26:16] out you're a christian and they start
[26:19] you know asking for prayer and you know
[26:20] i prayed for this you know okay whatever
[26:24] that's up to them and god you got your
[26:26] own self to worry about
[26:28] so god cleans that thing out
[26:31] all right so he cleans it out
[26:34] and puts it aside for service
[26:36] he's trying you
[26:38] to make sure that's clean
[26:40] right
[26:41] all right and then when he does
[26:43] he comes in by
[26:45] a new birth not your first birth from
[26:47] your mom and daddy that's what got you
[26:49] over there in that part of this all
[26:51] anyway all right
[26:53] now look your mama day didn't make you
[26:54] smoke or drink
[26:56] you did it yourself
[26:58] yes sir
[26:59] especially in this day and hour you
[27:00] gotta go buy that stuff
[27:02] and it's expensive
[27:04] but when you become born again
[27:07] then god fills that vessel with himself
[27:10] amen all right and then he puts you in
[27:12] service
[27:13] but you've got to have still got to have
[27:15] faith because faith is the new birth and
[27:17] it's faith new birth holy ghost all the
[27:19] same and it's one person it's the person
[27:22] of jesus christ he met you here
[27:26] in justification this is where he met
[27:28] you at
[27:29] but he don't want to just meet with you
[27:31] right
[27:32] he wants to be in you
[27:35] and then we can start doing these right
[27:38] oh many people can have you know have no
[27:41] temper at all that don't mean one thing
[27:42] to god
[27:44] nothing that don't mean nothing to god
[27:45] that you that you can control your
[27:47] temper
[27:49] without
[27:51] being provoked or being provoked or
[27:53] whatever that but remember what did we
[27:55] say temperance was control
[27:57] see that's where god comes in and shows
[27:59] you something else he gives you another
[28:00] revelation because i was talking sister
[28:02] johnny last sunday we never spoke about
[28:05] control downstairs with temperance we
[28:07] talked about temper
[28:09] what to do but remember it's all it's
[28:11] control
[28:13] it's a controlled faith
[28:15] jesus was standing on the bow of the
[28:17] boat
[28:17] all heck was breaking loose his
[28:19] disciples were saying why are you
[28:21] sleeping because and he just said
[28:24] where's your faith peace be still right
[28:27] he was what he but he was training them
[28:29] though to where when he went away and
[28:31] came back as the holy ghost they would
[28:33] be able to do what he did right same
[28:36] thing with you and i but what's happened
[28:37] down through the ages that makes us
[28:39] different than a lot of denominations
[28:42] is that denomination says well
[28:44] the new birth is and puts
[28:48] a slot here
[28:49] it says it's shaking the hand with the
[28:50] preacher or whatever
[28:52] right
[28:53] or the presbyterian says it's this
[28:56] or the pentecostal says you got to speak
[28:57] in tongues no the the real definition of
[29:01] the new birth is that you're born again
[29:05] by the word of god
[29:08] amen and you believe and receive the
[29:11] word of this hour
[29:13] okay because remember if we believe and
[29:16] receive the word of
[29:17] luther
[29:20] not good for this day
[29:21] we can't smoke a pipe and drink a beer
[29:24] he was a german that's what they did
[29:26] but god quickened that justification to
[29:29] him
[29:30] and that was his new birth but now we
[29:33] have to move remember i moved you got to
[29:35] move from that
[29:36] the lutherans
[29:39] sat down and said this is it yeah
[29:41] okay god moved on all right god moved on
[29:45] to sanctification to john wesley and
[29:47] then through the pentecostals brought in
[29:49] the baptism of the holy ghost around the
[29:51] turn of the century
[29:52] and now we've had in this hour
[29:55] we believe we've had a prophet come and
[29:57] try to tie all those loose ends together
[29:59] he took those walls of petition and he
[30:01] moved them out of the way
[30:03] to try to get all denominations to see
[30:05] that you've got to have faith in jesus
[30:07] christ not faith in the baptist faith in
[30:09] the methodist faith in the pentecostal
[30:11] faith in a brand of might right
[30:13] same thing friend of mine religion it's
[30:15] not
[30:16] it's jesus christ that's the basis of
[30:18] everything we're talking about because
[30:20] this was him if you look in the
[30:22] background you see his head
[30:24] this was was that one brother anderson
[30:26] can you pull that one up where he's
[30:28] standing in the middle of all that
[30:31] he can do it
[30:33] he's going to show you how you can do it
[30:34] there you go see that jesus christ is
[30:37] the head of all things and who are we
[30:40] we're his body he has no physical body
[30:43] on this earth except me and you in the
[30:46] spiritual sense all right that we are
[30:48] the spiritual body of jesus christ but
[30:50] you know what we're still a good solid
[30:52] body here all right we're not spirits
[30:54] floating around no we gotta we gotta
[30:56] have this teaching of the statue of
[30:58] perfect man to move us from just spirit
[31:01] into flesh
[31:03] the son of man is the word made flesh
[31:05] well the word can stay there all it can
[31:07] and be dead
[31:09] the word's not dead but the effects that
[31:11] we put on it is dead but if you take
[31:13] that word out though and place it in
[31:15] here then if you become the word made
[31:18] flesh
[31:18] you become as a prophet instead of
[31:21] walking breathing foot of god god don't
[31:23] have a foot down here except yours right
[31:26] god don't have a hand down here except
[31:27] yours all right so that's why we're
[31:29] teaching this statue of a perfect man to
[31:32] show us
[31:33] through these virtues that we can live a
[31:35] christian life and be able to
[31:39] tort the devil and take him and push him
[31:41] aside and say hey you know you don't
[31:43] have anything to do with me i'm a child
[31:46] of god that's right
[31:48] take your greasy hands off of them right
[31:51] that's the authority now to me
[31:53] that's
[31:54] that knowledge of how to use the faith
[31:56] temperance and all that so let's go
[31:57] through real quick sorry
[32:00] that's a little bit of background though
[32:02] that's good though
[32:04] good that we all refresh ourselves a
[32:05] little bit you know
[32:08] you got to know where you come from to
[32:09] know where you're going right all right
[32:11] so if we come from here we have a firm
[32:14] foundation remember i preached one time
[32:16] on feet
[32:17] feet
[32:19] equals redemption all right every time
[32:20] you look at feet you think of redemption
[32:22] well hey right here's your redemption
[32:24] process right here starts at faith faith
[32:27] virtue knowledge temperance and all
[32:28] those things that paul
[32:30] and peter talked about but remember
[32:32] it's a requirement
[32:35] and and power without character you can
[32:38] have the power you remember the seven
[32:40] sons of skeva they saw paul delivering
[32:43] people from demons
[32:45] right
[32:47] now they said we want to do that
[32:51] but they weren't where paul was right
[32:53] all right but they saw what power paul
[32:57] had and possessed and remember even the
[32:59] source simon the sorcerer he wanted to
[33:01] buy it right
[33:03] and then he got real serious but see
[33:05] down inside that's where god's going to
[33:06] look and all of us today down in here is
[33:08] where he knows he knew that simon the
[33:11] sorcerer had had another motive besides
[33:15] being a christian because he wasn't a
[33:16] christian right see the problem with
[33:18] simon a sorcerer he wanted to get way up
[33:20] here first
[33:22] and not start down here
[33:24] he didn't want to start and become a
[33:25] christian give his heart to god and
[33:27] forget all those things that he does all
[33:28] that witchcraft no he wanted to what
[33:30] have power over something right same
[33:33] with the seven sons of skeva they said
[33:35] we adjure thee in the name of jesus
[33:37] christ and you know the devil didn't
[33:40] even bother them a bit
[33:42] you know why because the man was not
[33:44] inside right jesus christ wasn't inside
[33:46] those seven sons and the devil turns and
[33:49] says paul we know
[33:52] jesus we know who are you
[33:54] in other words they were looking for the
[33:56] power without the character and power
[33:59] without character if it's used wrong is
[34:01] satanic
[34:02] all right so now
[34:04] and to show us how we get this is go to
[34:07] ephesians 4. i'm going to read these
[34:08] every time because
[34:10] it's something that we
[34:11] need to see
[34:14] ephesians 4 verse 11.
[34:17] and he gave some this is how
[34:19] peter showed us what we needed paul
[34:21] showed us how to get it all right
[34:23] because if
[34:24] if there's a requirement if peter gave
[34:26] us a requirement which they're required
[34:28] then god's got to make a way
[34:30] god is not a kind of person like me or
[34:33] you or anybody else that would that
[34:35] would give you something so difficult
[34:36] that you couldn't reach it right
[34:38] god's not that way god's got a plan and
[34:40] a purpose and he put that thing out
[34:42] there and he says hey you can get it
[34:45] i'm gonna make the way jesus is what i
[34:47] am the way the truth and the life i'm
[34:49] the door i'm the way to get in it's
[34:51] through jesus christ but it then now
[34:53] remember jesus is not here in the body
[34:55] form right right
[34:57] but he does have people that do what he
[35:01] says all right or has the mind of god
[35:04] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[35:06] some evangelists some pastors and
[35:07] teachers for what for the perfecting of
[35:10] me and you not just me
[35:13] me and you for the perfecting of the
[35:15] saints for the work of the ministry for
[35:17] the edifying of the body of christ
[35:20] all right
[35:21] till we all come
[35:24] in the unity of the faith
[35:26] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[35:28] unto a perfect man that's what we're
[35:29] talking about statue of perfect man
[35:31] unto the measure now what's measure
[35:34] height growth whatever
[35:36] excuse me to the measure of the stature
[35:38] not a statue we're not a statue statues
[35:41] don't move
[35:43] all right stature is move it's growth
[35:44] development stature of the fullness
[35:48] of christ now let's go to hebrews 5 14
[35:51] where paul is still peace speaking here
[35:52] he says but look strong meat belongs to
[35:54] them that are full age
[35:56] so god doesn't want us to stay babies
[35:59] listen we all got to start as a baby
[36:03] we all got to start as a baby but he
[36:05] doesn't want i i love deanna six years
[36:07] old i love her the age she is but
[36:11] it would be it would be horrible for me
[36:13] to say god i want to just stay six years
[36:14] old no that would be detrimental to who
[36:16] her
[36:18] same way with god god can't say well i
[36:20] know i like brother dick at that age
[36:21] right there i'm talking about spiritual
[36:23] age i want no that's detrimental to him
[36:27] god doesn't want you to do that he
[36:28] doesn't put a cap on it you do and i'm
[36:30] going to read it to you in just a minute
[36:32] all right
[36:34] excuse me but strong meat belongs to
[36:36] them they're a full age even those who
[36:39] by reason of what
[36:41] use
[36:42] got to use in faith muscles
[36:45] have their senses
[36:49] exercised to discern
[36:51] both good and evil what we talking about
[36:53] in temperance temperance is discern does
[36:56] earn both good
[36:57] and evil because remember we didn't
[36:59] discern good and evil when we were out
[37:01] in the world oh sure we knew we didn't
[37:03] need to murder somebody
[37:07] but we had we still was evil because
[37:10] jesus comes along he says hey you don't
[37:12] have to murder anybody now you just got
[37:13] to talk against them that's right you
[37:15] don't have to commit adultery with that
[37:16] woman you can just look after look at
[37:18] her and lust after and you've done the
[37:19] same thing
[37:21] because remember it's the same that's
[37:23] one word
[37:25] it's all evil right
[37:27] without god
[37:28] all right
[37:29] now hebrews 11 1 we got down to the
[37:32] foundation we spent a little time on
[37:33] that
[37:36] hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the
[37:38] substance of things hoped for
[37:42] the evidence of things not seen
[37:45] but i told you before
[37:47] you can't take virtue out and show it to
[37:50] somebody
[37:52] like a book or a pencil or whatever but
[37:54] you you let it work its way out and you
[37:57] manifest what that is
[37:59] all right remember remember god i never
[38:01] forget this
[38:02] god does it he reveals it then he has to
[38:06] make it manifest right all right
[38:08] because this is a secret
[38:12] but manifesting it is bringing it out in
[38:14] the open right the evidence of things
[38:17] not seen
[38:18] so now we talked last let's put the
[38:20] foundation chart up there like we were
[38:22] we were looking at
[38:24] a couple sundays ago
[38:26] and we were talking about just a minute
[38:27] ago justification sanctification and you
[38:30] must have faith add to
[38:33] your faith right
[38:35] add to your faith when you become born
[38:38] again that becomes your new birth not
[38:40] somebody else's so it ca it's mine
[38:44] okay it's mine right it's my faith now
[38:46] and god you know what god don't want it
[38:48] back
[38:49] bro god don't want it back he's not
[38:51] anything giver he don't give you or he
[38:53] won't give you a bunch of virtue and
[38:54] then say
[38:56] no god knows what you can handle before
[38:57] you even got here
[38:59] you just don't know it yet all right and
[39:01] that's the journey that we have to take
[39:03] somebody asked brother brown one time
[39:04] said brother i'm saying why do you
[39:05] preach if all this is set and done and
[39:07] settled well they weren't understanding
[39:09] what predestination and foreign
[39:10] knowledge was they were just looking at
[39:12] it as well if if they're going to you
[39:14] know preacher called me the other day
[39:15] and said he had a brother that come
[39:17] there and said well if they're going to
[39:18] be saved they're going to be saved it
[39:20] doesn't matter what you do
[39:22] god knows that
[39:25] but you and that person don't have a
[39:27] clue right
[39:28] amen so let's don't pick them out let
[39:30] god pick them out amen
[39:33] you know present the gospel to them and
[39:35] like i said
[39:36] brother brown says you know you'll see
[39:38] the predestination's off but it's
[39:39] because of what that person decided
[39:41] right
[39:42] you don't decide for them
[39:45] we've done it all before
[39:48] we've wrote them off
[39:51] haven't we
[39:52] well let god do that
[39:55] you just present you know what
[39:57] the life lib
[39:59] is going to
[40:01] show them
[40:02] whether you got it or not
[40:04] and whether they want it because of that
[40:06] thing called virtue
[40:08] amen
[40:09] all right
[40:10] so we have justification sanctification
[40:12] baptism holy ghost puts us into the body
[40:15] gives us faith
[40:17] and then it becomes your faith and
[40:19] you've got to believe
[40:21] that god can finish it because remember
[40:23] the prophet of god said faith alone will
[40:25] not do it now that's pretty outstanding
[40:28] because he based his whole
[40:30] message all 1100 sermons the first
[40:32] message he preached was faith the
[40:34] substance of things hoped for
[40:36] he based everything on faith and then he
[40:38] comes to the statue of perfect man he
[40:39] says faith alone won't do it
[40:42] won't do what won't make you up here
[40:45] faith will only get you in the body
[40:48] you'll be a good christian set in a pew
[40:50] but you're gonna we're gonna do your
[40:52] funeral one day
[40:57] but he's made a way to escape that right
[40:59] all right let's go to quote number one
[41:02] this is one i always like that we're
[41:03] gonna we're gonna read every time
[41:05] because it really refreshes i want to
[41:07] throw it all back on us and you know
[41:08] what he's not talking to you he's
[41:10] talking to us us all of us
[41:12] statue of perfect man 1962. notice you
[41:14] must be born again that's what we've
[41:16] been talking about
[41:17] and when you're born again you can't be
[41:20] born again without having faith all
[41:22] right you got to have a belief system
[41:24] you got to have a way to believe that
[41:26] god's already done it he doesn't have to
[41:27] come back and do it he's already done it
[41:30] so it's laying there waiting on you to
[41:31] just get it
[41:33] that's right so you see on my chart here
[41:35] i got the very foundation faith is the
[41:37] foundation of all of it scroll it up
[41:40] don't happen we'll just read the blue to
[41:42] save time
[41:45] you're possessed of one because you're
[41:48] either that's either faith or doubt you
[41:50] you've either got faith or doubt in your
[41:51] soul
[41:52] see now you can have faith and doubt in
[41:54] here don't get me wrong
[41:56] every day we because remember you got to
[41:58] have knowledge to discern what's right
[42:00] and wrong
[42:00] all right but inside you
[42:03] is either right or wrong
[42:04] that man that motivates you down in that
[42:07] control tower he's either
[42:09] faith or doubt not both all right
[42:13] that's the soul of man all right that's
[42:15] why you're very special to god because
[42:17] you're the only one that's got a soul
[42:18] that's close to him right
[42:20] you understand what i'm saying you got a
[42:22] soul
[42:23] god's the soul
[42:24] you got a soul but the dogs and the
[42:26] animals they don't have a soul so you
[42:28] are special to god but see remember they
[42:30] can't make a choice that soul in there
[42:32] gives you that choice between faith or
[42:34] doubt all right you're possessed of one
[42:36] that dominates your life just depends on
[42:39] how much faith you have is how high
[42:42] you can rise all right so we're putting
[42:44] he's putting it back on each one of us
[42:46] that ever half
[42:47] how you you know well i can't get rid of
[42:49] my temper
[42:51] you know what you're saying i don't want
[42:52] to get rid of it
[42:55] you like that thing you pet that devil
[42:58] you know what brother brown said about
[42:59] that woman
[43:00] at the dance hall remember he cast the
[43:03] demon out of her she walks by said she
[43:05] petted that devil and went into that
[43:07] back in that dance hall and came right
[43:08] back on her why because she want she
[43:11] there was a part of her that still
[43:12] wanted that
[43:13] part of that life and you can't have
[43:15] that first you got to have faith and
[43:17] then you talk about staying on that
[43:19] foundation but we must have a belief or
[43:22] a conviction we must be convinced
[43:24] that this is what it is
[43:27] christianity is the only way for us out
[43:28] of here there's no
[43:30] secondary
[43:33] there's no third there's no fourth
[43:35] choice
[43:37] one choice right that's either faith or
[43:39] doubt you're either going to believe or
[43:41] you're not going to believe all right so
[43:42] let's go to virtue now we talked about
[43:45] virtue now we're going to talk about as
[43:47] we were talking about virtue faith all
[43:50] right let's go to the chart because
[43:51] remember you never leave that foundation
[43:55] stay on that foundation you must stay
[43:57] right here and then as you're growing
[43:59] gone
[44:00] god gives you virtue faith and that's a
[44:03] faith that somebody else can pull from
[44:06] all right
[44:07] because remember faith alone won't do it
[44:09] faith alone will help you
[44:11] but aren't we here to help others
[44:13] all right so we must have virtue faith
[44:16] or strength or what they said you know
[44:18] we were talking about
[44:20] the word dunamis the word dunamis is
[44:22] power
[44:23] strength and jesus said in mark 5 verse
[44:25] 30 let's go to that one we'll hurry
[44:27] right through these because we've
[44:28] already been through them before
[44:30] but i just wanted you to
[44:32] kind of
[44:33] refresh your memory
[44:35] strength
[44:37] strong faith
[44:38] all right mark 5 verse 30.
[44:42] you did that not put it in there
[44:46] got it
[44:47] okay that's that's virtue look let's
[44:49] look at the at the definition
[44:52] strength or power or ability inherent
[44:54] power right in other words you don't
[44:56] have it you inherited it
[45:00] right
[45:00] you must develop this
[45:04] power residing in a thing by virtue of
[45:07] its nature or which a person or thing
[45:09] exerts are put forth
[45:12] powerful performing miracles moral power
[45:14] and excellence of soul so we just don't
[45:16] have faith anymore to believe we have a
[45:18] virtue faith or a strong faith that in
[45:22] that we can like we said many times
[45:24] before if you if
[45:26] if somebody writes you a check
[45:28] and it bounces
[45:30] we bounce one in our life that
[45:32] early and early on and we don't you know
[45:35] we just don't do that
[45:36] because morally it's not right because
[45:38] it says right here it says moral power
[45:41] all right you got to have some control
[45:42] there but the virtue well if we kept
[45:44] going but what if we kept going to a
[45:46] place and
[45:47] they kept writing me a bad check i'm not
[45:48] going to do any business with them
[45:49] anymore
[45:50] i'm not
[45:52] one time and that's it but you know what
[45:54] god's the same way
[45:55] what if brother donny comes to me and
[45:57] says
[45:58] pray for me but then i pray for him and
[46:01] i go out and he sees me out there at the
[46:03] bar with a drink in my hand and a
[46:04] cigarette now how much virtue can he
[46:07] bring from that
[46:09] you know what it does it puts a doubt in
[46:11] his mind
[46:13] i'm picking on you today you're just
[46:14] tall and just
[46:16] your head sticks up other than bigger
[46:17] than anybody else's
[46:20] it's really it's really white looking so
[46:22] i can see it
[46:26] but really i mean is that truth how can
[46:27] you draw virtue from that how can you
[46:29] draw virtue from from brother dale if he
[46:31] comes up here and preaches and then he
[46:33] says well i'll see y'all this afternoon
[46:34] and then we get here at two o'clock and
[46:36] we have a song service and we call the
[46:37] preacher out
[46:40] and we called the preacher out
[46:43] that's the word brother dale well he
[46:44] decided to go you know he decided to go
[46:46] down to bass pro and look around a
[46:47] little bit now how much virtue would you
[46:50] draw from that
[46:52] zero
[46:53] same way with our life to me when you've
[46:55] got faith when you come up to virtue
[46:58] that's a strength that others can draw
[47:00] from
[47:01] you're the only one who knows whether
[47:02] you got it or not
[47:04] okay but others should be able to see
[47:06] that you have it
[47:08] and then want more remember we were
[47:09] talking about the foolish virgin why
[47:11] does the foolish virgin come to the wise
[47:12] virgin
[47:14] because they got something that the
[47:15] foolish virgin doesn't have and it's a
[47:17] drawing effect or a power they have
[47:20] enough faith
[47:22] enough faith till they know you got it
[47:25] so they're going to come and get it from
[47:26] you why would they go get it from
[47:27] somebody that didn't have it all right
[47:29] same way that's what virtue is virtue is
[47:31] a faith or a strength a strong faith
[47:36] jesus immediately knowing himself that
[47:38] virtue had gone out of him turned him
[47:39] about in the press and said who touched
[47:41] my clothes now this was the woman that
[47:43] touched him they had the blood issue all
[47:45] she done is when he walked by she just
[47:47] touched him of his garment
[47:49] and strength went from him and virtue
[47:53] had to be in it to go out
[47:55] but what she drew from she drew from
[47:58] that virtue and she said if i could but
[48:00] touch
[48:01] the hem of his garment i could but touch
[48:03] i'll i'll be made whole so she was
[48:06] confessing what she done before she did
[48:08] it
[48:08] then when it happened then she drew
[48:11] virtue or strength from that opportunity
[48:14] same way with you and i
[48:16] same wish why we lay hands on the sick
[48:18] that's why you see brother dale
[48:19] sometimes he'll just kind of pat you on
[48:21] the back or or if your back's hurting or
[48:22] something he'll patch you right here or
[48:24] you know
[48:26] you don't know what's going to happen
[48:27] it's happened many times before right
[48:30] right where you just don't you don't
[48:31] even have to pray for him you're praying
[48:33] inside yourself well what is that that's
[48:34] a virtue strength that's the strength
[48:36] that you have that you can give to
[48:38] others and you know what they can draw
[48:39] from that
[48:40] that's the same way with all of us
[48:42] drawing together all right so let's go
[48:44] to acts 1 verse 2.
[48:46] now this word but you shall receive
[48:49] power
[48:50] now that word power is converted to
[48:52] dunamis which is converted to virtue
[48:55] but you shall receive virtue after
[48:59] see what that is now you've got to get
[49:02] the holy ghost first right after the
[49:04] holy ghost has come upon you ain't that
[49:05] good bob
[49:08] nobody's smiling i like that
[49:10] but you shall receive virtue because
[49:12] that power is dunamis which dunamis is
[49:14] virtue same thing when when when the
[49:16] virtue left jesus that word virtue and
[49:18] that word power means the same thing in
[49:20] the greek all right but you shall
[49:22] receive virtue after that the holy ghost
[49:24] has come upon you and you shall be
[49:26] witnesses
[49:27] so somebody's going to know that all
[49:29] right so let's go to the second quote
[49:33] statue of a perfect man
[49:36] he's talking about the book of luke
[49:37] verse you went out of him
[49:39] now to be like jesus well i'm going to
[49:41] be like jesus i've got to have virtue
[49:42] and a past that it can pass forward from
[49:46] me to the people right right that's the
[49:48] whole deal with all these virtues
[49:52] sure you can have enough for yourself
[49:54] but god doesn't want you to keep them
[49:57] he wants you to give them to somebody
[49:58] else that's why brother dale studies all
[50:01] the time what he does he gets the
[50:02] knowledge of god
[50:05] paul said we have the mind of christ
[50:06] somebody has to get it first apostles
[50:08] prophets pastors teaching spanish has to
[50:10] get it first and then what god does god
[50:13] passes it down through
[50:15] that person to you well now here you got
[50:18] you know 85 or so 90 people sitting here
[50:22] from one person should be flowing to
[50:24] where each one of you should get
[50:26] something from god you're not going to
[50:27] all get the same thing right
[50:30] amen but it's a pass and brother branham
[50:33] you know he he was a he was the trumpet
[50:35] he was the one that sounded the message
[50:38] then we take that message and we sound
[50:40] it to the people all right but it can't
[50:42] be different
[50:43] remember uncertain sound you can't have
[50:45] an uncertain sound right
[50:47] all right you can't be
[50:48] toot and retreat when you should be
[50:50] charging big mess up there somewhere all
[50:53] right so you got what you got to do
[50:54] though is you got to have the next one
[50:56] which is knowledge
[50:58] all right let's go to knowledge because
[50:59] that's the discernment part you got to
[51:01] discern
[51:04] good from bad all right let's go to the
[51:06] next one which is knowledge and it's
[51:09] knowledge faith on the chart all right
[51:12] but we're going to define it knowledge
[51:14] signifies in general intelligence
[51:16] understanding
[51:17] not just not just smarts up here
[51:20] all right
[51:20] that smart's got to come down through
[51:22] the filter
[51:23] amen you have it up here you we've
[51:25] listened to many false doctrines
[51:28] once we drop it through that filter
[51:30] though
[51:32] we discern whether it's right or wrong
[51:34] because sometimes you'll hear it up here
[51:35] and you think man that sounds good
[51:37] but running through the filter
[51:39] and you'll see that there's a little
[51:41] something off there
[51:42] the general knowledge of christian
[51:44] religion the deeper
[51:45] more perfect and enlarged knowledge of
[51:48] this religion such as belongs to the
[51:51] more advanced
[51:52] what paul says said let's don't be
[51:54] babies let's grow up all right such as
[51:56] belongs to the more advanced especially
[51:58] of things lawful and unlawful for
[52:00] christians
[52:01] moral wisdom such as seen in right
[52:05] living all right so we that word there
[52:07] was what discernment we looked at that
[52:09] discernment and it's required of a
[52:11] christian it's required every day that
[52:13] you deserve right
[52:16] every day you must discern
[52:18] good and evil what you should do and
[52:20] what you shouldn't do and hey listen we
[52:22] get trapped in satan's trap we're not
[52:25] immune
[52:26] right
[52:27] we get trapped but you know what there's
[52:29] an advocate there
[52:31] that stands up and says i've already
[52:33] took that right amen
[52:36] i've already took all that and i put it
[52:38] behind me
[52:39] he said i can't remember it that's why
[52:42] you know brother dale's talking about
[52:43] god with amnesia what about something
[52:45] you and i did it the other day uh
[52:47] something came to my mind and i thought
[52:49] well lord
[52:50] i just shouldn't know forgive me that
[52:52] was back when i was a sinner
[52:53] and i'm sure he's sitting up here going
[52:54] what are you talking about
[52:58] what are you talking about
[52:59] what are you talking about you know the
[53:00] song what are you talking about my sins
[53:02] what are you talking about those that
[53:03] listen you should never ask forgiveness
[53:05] for those things you already asked
[53:06] forgiveness for
[53:08] right because you know what you're doing
[53:09] satan's bringing it right back
[53:12] and the best thing to do is is not say
[53:13] forgive me lord why he's already forgive
[53:16] you if you've already asked now if you
[53:17] hadn't he may be bringing something that
[53:18] may be god bringing something to you but
[53:21] if satan keeps bringing this junk to you
[53:22] just keep pushing it off you say god you
[53:25] know
[53:25] i didn't do that
[53:28] but he has knowledge to discern man this
[53:31] thing right here
[53:33] it's a devil's playground
[53:36] but it's also the only way god can get
[53:38] to you
[53:39] amen so you got to use that filter of
[53:42] knowledge knowledge faith
[53:44] and faith is what wisdom
[53:47] wisdom is the ability to think and act
[53:49] using knowledge experience understanding
[53:52] common sense and insight i like that
[53:55] word insight it's not just regular site
[53:58] it's insight something you got to look
[53:59] into let's look at the quote here number
[54:01] four
[54:05] skip three just go to four we'll save
[54:06] some time here
[54:08] we're not to get to
[54:10] we're not going to get all this the
[54:12] revelation of jesus christ church age
[54:14] book
[54:15] bringing these two thoughts together you
[54:17] will see that it won't take just
[54:18] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[54:21] book real see that's what man's done
[54:23] man's put their ordinary ideas to it and
[54:25] said matthew 28 19 now jesus said
[54:29] i'm going to take what jesus said jesus
[54:30] said baptize name father son holy ghost
[54:33] well now peter comes up on the day of
[54:34] pentecost he's got the keys to the
[54:36] kingdom jesus told him himself now how
[54:38] confused could jesus be if he told peter
[54:40] he said peter whatever you say down here
[54:42] i'll say up there
[54:44] whatever you close up there i'll close
[54:45] down here and then peter comes up on the
[54:47] day of pentecost and said be baptized in
[54:48] the name of the lord jesus christ acts 2
[54:50] 38.
[54:51] now
[54:52] jesus is not that confused
[54:56] god's not that confused that was god in
[54:57] human flesh so he don't make mistakes
[55:00] but what do you do he hid it from the
[55:02] people
[55:03] he said in the name of the father and of
[55:05] the son of the holy ghost now father's
[55:07] not her name son is not a name holy
[55:09] ghost is not a name so we had to have
[55:11] some spiritual insight
[55:13] to see that that's exactly what jesus
[55:16] was saying on paper right
[55:18] but when peter comes up on the day of
[55:20] pentecost jesus is not up in heaven
[55:22] going no peter no no no no pop stop stop
[55:26] stop don't say that no when he clicks
[55:28] that when he says be baptized in the
[55:29] name of the lord jesus christ he turned
[55:31] that key and jesus said
[55:33] that's it that's my boy
[55:35] he knew what i was talking about
[55:38] because i said name and father another
[55:40] name sons know the name but you know
[55:41] what lord jesus christ is the name
[55:44] all right so peter picks that up and
[55:45] peter says this is the way it is repent
[55:48] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[55:50] christ
[55:51] for the remission of your sins right and
[55:54] you shall receive what the gift of the
[55:55] holy ghost
[55:56] it's going to take the operation of the
[55:58] holy ghost that means this book now
[56:00] what'd you talk about the bible
[56:01] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[56:03] but a special class of people right it
[56:06] will take one with prophetic
[56:09] insight
[56:11] or knowledge or knowledge faith all
[56:13] right it will require the ability to
[56:15] hear from god
[56:17] got to have a channel there
[56:19] how you going to hear from god apostles
[56:21] prophets pastors teachers evangelists
[56:24] amen all right can't do away with those
[56:26] five offices
[56:27] that where this comes down through it
[56:29] will require the ability to hear from
[56:31] god it will require supernatural
[56:33] instruction
[56:35] not just a student companion verse with
[56:37] verse though that is good and it's good
[56:38] to compare verse to verse but if you
[56:40] compare matthew 28 19 with acts 2 38
[56:43] you're looking on paper at a controversy
[56:46] i said on a paper at a controversy
[56:48] right
[56:49] but it's not peter's saying exactly what
[56:51] jesus said
[56:53] all right same thing
[56:55] because what is the name of the father
[56:57] the lord son is jesus
[57:00] lord jesus christ father son holy ghost
[57:02] holy ghost is the christ it was back two
[57:04] thousand years i mean that was back
[57:05] before the world all right
[57:08] same man amen
[57:10] it will require supernatural you see how
[57:12] that little that little doctrine of
[57:14] father son holy ghost has swerved
[57:16] everybody over to the side and here's
[57:18] god over here going wait a minute i
[57:20] never said that
[57:22] listen to what peter said peter's my
[57:24] apostle prophet pastor teacher and
[57:26] evangelist this is how you're going to
[57:27] get it you need to listen to peter
[57:29] it will require the ability to hear from
[57:31] god it requires supernatural instruction
[57:33] not just a student companion verse with
[57:35] verse though that is good
[57:37] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[57:40] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[57:43] how we need to hear from god and lay
[57:45] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[57:47] spirit to hear and what no what's that
[57:50] what's the first four letters of
[57:52] knowledge no right
[57:55] all right so you got to have knowledge
[57:58] our knowledge faith all right so then
[58:01] and the next one now is temperance we're
[58:03] stacking them right on top of each other
[58:05] got to have virtue got to have knowledge
[58:08] now we've got to have what temperance
[58:11] faith
[58:11] not just regular faith it's going to be
[58:13] temperance faith all right which is what
[58:16] it's a controlled faith
[58:18] all right right
[58:21] bless my soul with self-control brother
[58:23] branham was
[58:24] was singing there on the statue of
[58:25] perfect man but remember
[58:28] a controlled faith is like jesus with
[58:30] all the demons
[58:32] now listen the demon did i mean when
[58:34] jesus walked up to the the man called
[58:36] legion which legion is what
[58:39] thousands right right so he had that
[58:41] many demons in him
[58:43] that's a lot
[58:45] right but jesus saw a man and had
[58:47] compassion on a man
[58:48] but now what happened was the first
[58:50] thing what did those demons do they
[58:52] recognized
[58:54] who that was
[58:57] why thou son of god
[59:00] why do you come and deal with us in
[59:02] other words before our time right
[59:05] they knew more than the religious people
[59:07] of the world knew
[59:09] the pharisees and sadducees called him a
[59:11] devil the devil called him god
[59:17] you know why because there was a spirit
[59:18] fight in the spirit right right it was a
[59:20] spiritual warfare going on because
[59:22] legion probably looked at the man and
[59:24] didn't say anything the demons spoke out
[59:26] of him and said why have you thou son of
[59:28] god so they identified who he was thou
[59:31] son of god why did you come before your
[59:33] time before our time in other words
[59:35] judgment to deal with us and you know
[59:37] what jesus didn't bicker back and forth
[59:39] with him he wasn't like the seven sons
[59:41] of skiva he wasn't worried about them
[59:42] coming back on him
[59:44] because they honored who he was
[59:46] thou son of god
[59:48] so they put him in his position but he
[59:50] put them in their position you know what
[59:52] he didn't go over there and scream and
[59:53] slap him around he they said can we
[59:56] leave
[59:56] i like a demon when he asks something
[59:59] can we leave
[1:00:00] and he said go
[1:00:06] resist the devil and he will what
[1:00:09] walk away from you
[1:00:11] he said flee from you boy that's a
[1:00:14] powerful little statement there we just
[1:00:16] don't use it enough
[1:00:18] everybody all right
[1:00:21] but jesus with the demons and then
[1:00:22] remember the storm there was that
[1:00:24] controlled faith that was faith where
[1:00:26] jesus didn't look at the circumstances
[1:00:28] because remember jesus walking on the
[1:00:30] water he wasn't worried about sinking
[1:00:33] but when peter lost sight and i saw one
[1:00:36] of those things the other day too and i
[1:00:37] want to go up there to that bumper
[1:00:39] sticker and put
[1:00:40] peter did
[1:00:42] you know though some bumper stickers
[1:00:43] says jesus walked on water
[1:00:46] you know how about you or or you know
[1:00:47] he's the only one that walked on you
[1:00:49] think you're perfect jesus is the only
[1:00:50] one who walked on water no he didn't
[1:00:52] peter got out of the boat
[1:00:55] got into the water and did not sink
[1:00:58] right
[1:01:02] but peter didn't have a substance faith
[1:01:04] at that time
[1:01:06] right
[1:01:07] he was drawing virtue off of god or
[1:01:10] jesus christ right so he was looking but
[1:01:12] brother brown said when he looked at the
[1:01:14] circumstances in other words what peter
[1:01:16] done is what we should do all the time
[1:01:19] is don't deal with the circumstances
[1:01:20] just say okay god you said so
[1:01:24] no what he done is he said okay god you
[1:01:26] said so oh
[1:01:29] um
[1:01:30] i'm not supposed to do this
[1:01:32] um
[1:01:35] and you know what what happened he sank
[1:01:37] but remember jesus brought him back out
[1:01:40] but jesus had a controlled faith and
[1:01:42] that's what we all should look for as a
[1:01:44] controlled faith uh and not just and
[1:01:46] really we
[1:01:48] you know brother branham never said i
[1:01:50] can't read where he said get rid of your
[1:01:52] temper
[1:01:54] he says control
[1:01:56] your ungodly temper all right because
[1:01:59] listen
[1:02:00] we get frustrated a lot of times
[1:02:03] once in a while once in the morning
[1:02:05] while in the afternoon
[1:02:11] but remember
[1:02:12] in the world our frustrations would lead
[1:02:14] to anger amen
[1:02:16] our frustrations would lead to anger but
[1:02:19] now we can be frustrated about different
[1:02:21] things and that's okay
[1:02:24] that's the humanity part of us all right
[1:02:26] but you don't let because remember if
[1:02:28] you have controlled faith that control
[1:02:31] faith comes up and says that's enough
[1:02:34] stop right here
[1:02:35] don't do that anymore you know you
[1:02:37] shouldn't do that you know you shouldn't
[1:02:39] be thinking about that person did it run
[1:02:41] you off the road sister johnny
[1:02:45] she's from new york she gets a free pass
[1:02:49] with traffic problems
[1:02:51] he's i couldn't live up there either i
[1:02:53] did it it worked my temperance and
[1:02:55] patience and knowledge and all that
[1:02:57] stuff to have to deal with that traffic
[1:02:59] but no we don't ever get a free pass we
[1:03:02] got to go through it
[1:03:04] to see that god's give it to us
[1:03:07] we cannot sit at home and get these
[1:03:10] virtues and it be a flowery bed of ease
[1:03:14] this is not
[1:03:15] forks and spoons
[1:03:17] this is knives
[1:03:19] guns shields armor
[1:03:22] whatever you got
[1:03:24] you know what if god if satan brother
[1:03:25] brown said satan's gonna turn every gun
[1:03:27] on you
[1:03:29] right right
[1:03:30] now god's not going to let him kill you
[1:03:33] so he's going to give you something to
[1:03:34] protect when he does turn he's going to
[1:03:36] give you something you know what you got
[1:03:38] to believe that you already got it
[1:03:41] not that you got to go get it
[1:03:46] this is development brothers and sisters
[1:03:48] this is development
[1:03:50] we're not going to get it overnight
[1:03:51] we've got to develop into these things
[1:03:53] right but that temperance faith to me is
[1:03:55] sure it's controlling your ungodly
[1:03:56] temper brother brown says in the
[1:03:57] blasphemous name but he also said
[1:04:00] control
[1:04:01] it's a controlled faith where you're
[1:04:03] that's what brother billy paul he was so
[1:04:05] amazed with brother branham when he
[1:04:06] stood in the audience of several
[1:04:07] thousand people he said i take every
[1:04:10] spirit in here under my what control
[1:04:13] he had temperance faith he had that
[1:04:16] control where he could control
[1:04:17] everything that was going on but you
[1:04:19] know what it come from god almighty that
[1:04:21] was in him
[1:04:23] right
[1:04:24] amen so there's your controlled faith
[1:04:26] and that's the same thing with you and i
[1:04:28] like like i told you about what what
[1:04:30] happened to the prophet he walks into
[1:04:31] the house and his wife's crying and his
[1:04:34] kids are fighting and all you know all
[1:04:35] heck's breaking loose and
[1:04:38] first thing he does he puts on an apron
[1:04:41] puts on a holy ghost apron
[1:04:44] and he walks in there and says honey and
[1:04:46] he says i'm praying for her the whole
[1:04:47] time he's rubbing her back you know and
[1:04:49] said
[1:04:50] how about that dress you know he's not
[1:04:52] quoting the scripture now bless god's
[1:04:53] sister you're supposed to be no he said
[1:04:55] you remember that dress that i was
[1:04:56] looking at yeah let's go look at it she
[1:04:59] says we ain't got time to go look at
[1:05:00] that dress he said about 10 minutes
[1:05:02] later she's wanting to go look at the
[1:05:03] dress well
[1:05:06] i've told y'all many times if you want
[1:05:08] if you want to if you want to be close
[1:05:09] to your wife you ain't got to go buy no
[1:05:11] sexy outfit
[1:05:13] get you a washcloth get you a spray
[1:05:15] bottle with windex
[1:05:17] a broom and a mop
[1:05:20] watch what happens
[1:05:27] watch what happens it won't cost you a
[1:05:29] dime just maybe a little bit of
[1:05:31] a sweat
[1:05:33] sometimes we need that
[1:05:35] but let's look at what brother ryan said
[1:05:37] about
[1:05:39] quote number five
[1:05:42] we may have to do godliness and brother
[1:05:43] kindness this afternoon if that's all
[1:05:45] right
[1:05:47] because look temperance doesn't mean
[1:05:48] stop drinking alcohol here either no no
[1:05:51] temperance doesn't mean alcohol is cure
[1:05:54] because see
[1:05:55] we're we're not this is not like i've
[1:05:57] always said before
[1:05:59] when you come in here and and you become
[1:06:01] a christian
[1:06:02] it's not it's not rehab
[1:06:07] no it's not rehab right
[1:06:10] it's release
[1:06:13] it's not rehab because i know i know
[1:06:15] people that are in that are in
[1:06:16] alcoholics anonymous they just suppress
[1:06:18] that demon they have no way to get it
[1:06:19] out right
[1:06:21] you can't talk never brother branham you
[1:06:22] can't talk to them demons that's right
[1:06:24] you especially can't talk to them if the
[1:06:26] guy that's talking to him has got a
[1:06:27] demon so they're just talking back and
[1:06:28] forth
[1:06:30] but if you take and come here though we
[1:06:32] believe in deliverance
[1:06:35] which is not that temperance see brother
[1:06:37] brown many people would probably say
[1:06:38] well he looks at temperance is quitting
[1:06:41] drinking and all these things but no
[1:06:42] it's look
[1:06:44] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:06:46] flesh
[1:06:47] so he's not dealing with the flesh guy
[1:06:48] if you ever get the soul of the man
[1:06:50] changed right amen you don't have to
[1:06:53] worry about him
[1:06:54] drinking and smoking because remember
[1:06:55] that all supposed to go out of
[1:06:56] sanctification that's just one of the
[1:06:58] lusts of the flesh but we're talking
[1:07:00] about holy spirit temperance that means
[1:07:02] how to control
[1:07:05] your tongue not be a toddler how to
[1:07:07] control your temper not fall off every
[1:07:08] time anybody speaks cross to you and
[1:07:11] then we went on and developed a little
[1:07:12] bit more we won't read the other ones
[1:07:14] let's go now
[1:07:15] last week we were talking about patience
[1:07:18] so let's talk about patience because
[1:07:19] patience
[1:07:20] patience and temperance to me goes
[1:07:22] together real close
[1:07:24] all right you gotta have you gotta first
[1:07:26] have temperance though because
[1:07:30] remember
[1:07:31] tribulation
[1:07:33] worketh
[1:07:35] patience
[1:07:37] so listen to try your patience
[1:07:41] you're going to have to have
[1:07:42] all these
[1:07:44] and rely on them to have this
[1:07:47] okay
[1:07:48] you're going to have these to rely you
[1:07:50] got to rely on these because brother
[1:07:51] brown said you can't skip one
[1:07:53] so they got to come up the way they are
[1:07:54] you can't skip one if you do this whole
[1:07:57] thing crumbles and he said it all falls
[1:07:59] down right same way with building a
[1:08:00] five-story building one two three four
[1:08:02] five
[1:08:03] you can't start on ground floor and then
[1:08:05] build i'm going your plans next is let's
[1:08:07] build level two before we build level
[1:08:09] one no way you can do that all right
[1:08:11] same way with god right look how these
[1:08:13] stack on top of each other you gotta
[1:08:14] have virtue faith you gotta have
[1:08:16] strength you gotta have knowledge to
[1:08:18] know
[1:08:19] good and evil
[1:08:20] or good or bad or whichever
[1:08:22] temperance faith you must have tempers
[1:08:24] to control the faith that you have
[1:08:26] all right and control all these other
[1:08:28] things that you have that come against
[1:08:30] you because we're really we're dealing
[1:08:31] we're not dealing with the soul of man
[1:08:33] here
[1:08:34] except down here
[1:08:36] by either faith or doubt right
[1:08:38] right we're dealing with the second
[1:08:40] realm the memory reason conscious
[1:08:42] affection imagination that's where all
[1:08:43] this right here works in okay because
[1:08:46] you do have the patience of god you do
[1:08:47] have a part of patience when you receive
[1:08:49] the new birth but god doesn't want
[1:08:50] remember brother said faith alone
[1:08:52] doesn't do it what foundation faith
[1:08:54] alone doesn't do it you got to have a
[1:08:56] patience faith
[1:08:57] all right now what do you say about
[1:08:59] patience faith
[1:09:01] look at luke 21 19.
[1:09:09] in your patience possess ye
[1:09:13] your soul that's right
[1:09:15] the word patience means steadfastness
[1:09:18] constancy not all this up and down stuff
[1:09:22] all right
[1:09:24] endurance
[1:09:25] paul said we're going to run this race
[1:09:26] and we're going to finish it
[1:09:28] all right right in the new testament the
[1:09:30] characteristics of a man who is not
[1:09:32] swerved from his deliberate
[1:09:35] purpose and his loyalty to faith and
[1:09:37] piety by even the greatest
[1:09:42] trials and sufferings
[1:09:44] patiently and steadfastly a patient
[1:09:47] steadfast waiting for a patient enduring
[1:09:51] sustaining
[1:09:52] perseverance
[1:09:54] so we brought out that word last sunday
[1:09:55] if you'll remember enduring
[1:09:57] so you must have that patience faith or
[1:10:00] an enduring faith
[1:10:02] that you don't just lay it on the shelf
[1:10:04] on sunday
[1:10:05] and pick it back up on saturday evening
[1:10:10] right well i got patience when i'm
[1:10:11] around the people well they ain't gonna
[1:10:13] give you patience
[1:10:17] it's when you have to deal with all them
[1:10:18] kooks
[1:10:24] easy around here that's why i said here
[1:10:26] it's easy to live like a christian when
[1:10:28] you get into the you get into the dome
[1:10:30] of the spirit of god and you know that
[1:10:32] this building's been dedicated to god
[1:10:34] and we know the word's been preached and
[1:10:36] it's been hit heard and it's being
[1:10:38] taught and it's been everything's
[1:10:39] correct and the way it should go sure
[1:10:41] easy to have patience easy to have
[1:10:43] virtue he didn't have nothing yeah it
[1:10:45] really is right
[1:10:47] but monday morning
[1:10:51] when your feet hit the floor
[1:10:54] are you still going to have that same
[1:10:56] patience faith as you had well if you're
[1:10:58] enduring
[1:11:00] you will but you know what you're not
[1:11:01] going to be enduring if monday you get
[1:11:03] up and you go and you see a white dove
[1:11:05] fly through your bedroom
[1:11:07] and your kids do everything you tell
[1:11:09] them to do
[1:11:10] and there's zero traffic on the road
[1:11:12] going to work
[1:11:13] and when you get to work your boss says
[1:11:14] i'm giving you a ten thousand dollar
[1:11:16] raise
[1:11:17] you know what's going to happen at that
[1:11:18] time
[1:11:20] the alarm clock's gonna go off and
[1:11:21] you're gonna wake up
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] are your wife gonna go hey wake up
[1:11:28] you're mumbling stupid stuff when you
[1:11:30] wake up
[1:11:33] and then reality strikes
[1:11:38] god get we laugh a little bit god give
[1:11:40] us a provision to get through that
[1:11:42] though
[1:11:43] he give us our backpack our provision is
[1:11:46] full of things to get through that
[1:11:49] what you and i have to do is we have to
[1:11:50] reach back there and use what we got
[1:11:52] sunday and wednesday and the times we're
[1:11:54] praying and the times we're studying we
[1:11:56] got to reach and get that sword and be
[1:11:58] able to use it that's why i want
[1:12:01] excuse me us to see that that scripture
[1:12:03] says there in peter it says exercise
[1:12:06] you've got to exercise your faith not
[1:12:07] but hebrews you got to exercise your
[1:12:09] faith it's got to be exercise all right
[1:12:12] exercise
[1:12:13] is good for you
[1:12:15] especially your faith
[1:12:16] and how you're going to exercise your
[1:12:18] faith without going through something
[1:12:19] right amen
[1:12:21] i mean sometimes you say lord are you
[1:12:23] just pouring it on me today
[1:12:25] no there's somebody else getting it just
[1:12:26] like you
[1:12:28] but you know what some of us are a
[1:12:30] little more stubborn than others
[1:12:33] so we have to go through them several
[1:12:34] times romans 5
[1:12:37] verse 1 through 4 therefore being
[1:12:39] justified by faith that's what we're
[1:12:40] talking about at the beginning justified
[1:12:42] by white faith you got to believe
[1:12:44] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:12:46] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[1:12:49] by faith
[1:12:50] so there's the access by faith
[1:12:53] into this grace wherein we stand and
[1:12:55] rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[1:12:57] and not only so but we glory in
[1:13:01] we wait a minute you missed that part
[1:13:05] wait what
[1:13:07] glory and tribulation also
[1:13:10] this is good
[1:13:12] but this is better yeah
[1:13:14] knowing knowing see there you go go back
[1:13:17] you got to have what
[1:13:19] you got to have knowing right now that
[1:13:21] ain't just knowing physically that's
[1:13:23] knowing that's that anchor down in here
[1:13:25] all right without it we go wild but when
[1:13:27] we got that anchor knowing that god told
[1:13:30] us this
[1:13:31] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:13:33] patience
[1:13:34] and patience experience
[1:13:37] and experience hope amen so it builds
[1:13:40] all on patience
[1:13:42] all right let's go to hebrews 10 verse
[1:13:44] 36.
[1:13:47] for ye have need of patience
[1:13:50] that after you have done the will of god
[1:13:53] not before
[1:13:55] after ye have done the will of god ye
[1:13:58] might receive what the promise
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:03] the promise is a body change if you'll
[1:14:05] understand it in that way now you can
[1:14:07] say that receive the promise is eternal
[1:14:09] life that's okay
[1:14:10] but you've got to have eternal life for
[1:14:11] you have a body change
[1:14:13] right so we got to have these things
[1:14:14] lined up now in james verse 1
[1:14:19] my brethren count it all
[1:14:24] everybody say that word
[1:14:26] joy
[1:14:28] when you fall
[1:14:30] i don't mean fall i don't mean backslide
[1:14:33] but when you fall into many temptations
[1:14:38] knowing this there you go back to
[1:14:39] knowledge again knowing this that the
[1:14:42] trying of god's faith
[1:14:45] worketh
[1:14:47] oh what does that say
[1:14:49] yours
[1:14:50] you haven't left of your faith yet have
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:53] you got to still have your faith to come
[1:14:55] all the way up here knowing this that
[1:14:56] the trying of your faith
[1:14:58] work its patience
[1:15:00] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:15:03] that you may be white perfect and entire
[1:15:06] wanting nothing what a promise
[1:15:11] now what did brother brown say let's go
[1:15:13] to quote number nine
[1:15:17] wow sorry to take so long but
[1:15:19] we'll just do godliness and brotherly
[1:15:20] kindness this afternoon
[1:15:23] all right look
[1:15:25] the holy spirit will make every movement
[1:15:26] like christ what it takes to what it
[1:15:29] takes to make a christian life
[1:15:31] it'll make you christ light the fruits
[1:15:33] of the spirits love joy peace long
[1:15:34] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[1:15:36] patience and faith these things are what
[1:15:38] the holy spirit controls
[1:15:40] our emotions
[1:15:42] that's right that's remember that's the
[1:15:44] filter that's the memory reason
[1:15:45] conscious affection imagination that's
[1:15:47] emotion
[1:15:48] all right
[1:15:49] because remember
[1:15:52] and i don't know that we got it here but
[1:15:54] remember when jesus
[1:15:56] maybe we do
[1:15:57] remember when jesus sat down and read
[1:15:59] the scrolls the greatest anointing right
[1:16:01] okay that wasn't
[1:16:04] it was not emotional but it came from
[1:16:06] the very emotion of god
[1:16:09] when he spoke point it says precious
[1:16:11] words came from his lips our emotions is
[1:16:13] not so much as jumping up and down you
[1:16:15] could do that a shin dig will bring that
[1:16:17] to you remember we tried to explain what
[1:16:19] a shin dig is a hoe down or a hee haw or
[1:16:22] whatever that is
[1:16:24] but look it doesn't take that a shin dig
[1:16:26] will bring that to you
[1:16:27] that's why you see the people out in the
[1:16:29] world
[1:16:30] get emotional
[1:16:31] satan's emotional
[1:16:33] satan's an emotional person he loves
[1:16:35] music he was he was you know brother
[1:16:37] rhymes he was god's uh song leader there
[1:16:40] before time i mean he's very he's very
[1:16:42] emotional
[1:16:43] and if
[1:16:44] all they do in the world is when they go
[1:16:46] to these concerts and you know pitch a
[1:16:48] fit
[1:16:49] what is that it's an emotion
[1:16:51] that they're doing but it's an emotion
[1:16:53] towards satan not a motion toward god
[1:16:55] all right god doesn't need all that
[1:16:57] build up to get
[1:16:59] his emotion out
[1:17:01] all right that's what pentecost done he
[1:17:03] got everybody emotional but brother
[1:17:05] brown said you better be able when you
[1:17:07] fall and walk out the door in other
[1:17:08] words on monday morning you better be
[1:17:10] able to walk the same way you did when
[1:17:12] you was jumping up and down shouting in
[1:17:13] the church like i said it's easy to
[1:17:15] shout here what about monday afternoon
[1:17:17] is it easy to shout monday afternoon
[1:17:19] just at your children than your wife
[1:17:22] that you walk in peace and love and joy
[1:17:24] with long suffering goodness meekness
[1:17:25] gentleness patience you see it isn't
[1:17:27] something that you do
[1:17:29] it's something the holy spirit does in
[1:17:31] you
[1:17:34] because like i said this is not
[1:17:35] alcoholics anonymous this is not this is
[1:17:37] not mind over matter
[1:17:40] okay
[1:17:41] you see it's no longer an intellectual
[1:17:44] thought of your own
[1:17:45] it's a subconscious moving of the holy
[1:17:48] spirit oh i wish i could shout the
[1:17:50] praises of god around the world
[1:17:52] to that
[1:17:53] many times i've told you before i've
[1:17:54] been i was on the phone
[1:17:56] not saying anything about where i was
[1:17:58] but i know where god took me to is
[1:18:00] talking to a friend of mine and you know
[1:18:01] i used to
[1:18:02] use that word aws a lot
[1:18:04] i wasn't talking about a donkey either
[1:18:07] and i was talking on the phone and i was
[1:18:08] going to say that word that word was in
[1:18:10] my brain this was just you know
[1:18:13] young christian
[1:18:15] but i didn't say those words anymore but
[1:18:17] it was coming out
[1:18:20] and it felt like somebody took have you
[1:18:22] ever been hit right here in the sternum
[1:18:24] you know people you play football you've
[1:18:25] been hit right here what knocks the
[1:18:26] breath out of you right well something
[1:18:28] just i was on the phone driving down
[1:18:29] through there and i was talking to him
[1:18:31] and i said well he was just a something
[1:18:33] and i was going to say that word and it
[1:18:35] just went something went
[1:18:36] just like somebody punched me right just
[1:18:38] you know didn't hurt me really just
[1:18:40] punched no air went out of my went out
[1:18:42] of my lungs and he said what was that
[1:18:44] i said well i was going to say that word
[1:18:46] i used to say a lot and i said lord
[1:18:48] wouldn't let me say it no more
[1:18:50] so i i knew then that that part of me
[1:18:52] was over i didn't have to worry about
[1:18:54] you know that word slipping out or
[1:18:56] anything like that you gotta
[1:18:58] i mean you know what god will give you
[1:19:00] that to show you
[1:19:01] whether you have or have it
[1:19:04] because if i hadn't i'd had to took that
[1:19:06] over again that would have been a
[1:19:07] do-over another class i'd have to took
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:11] because if you're a child of god you're
[1:19:12] going to have to come to these things
[1:19:14] amen all right he don't just leave your
[1:19:16] hand and say well forget him no he he's
[1:19:20] he's still the school master until he
[1:19:22] becomes the tutor and then the tutor is
[1:19:23] the one that teaches you right all right
[1:19:25] let's go to the next one let's read
[1:19:26] these and then we'll stop right here
[1:19:28] what do you say the first thing
[1:19:30] patience with what what kind of patience
[1:19:33] first thing
[1:19:35] is have patience with god right
[1:19:38] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:19:40] have real genuine patience because faith
[1:19:43] worketh patience
[1:19:45] when god says anything you believe it
[1:19:48] matthew 28 19 acts 2 38 i believe that's
[1:19:52] what god said amen god said to be
[1:19:54] baptized in his name so i'm going to be
[1:19:56] baptized the name of lord jesus christ
[1:19:58] amen according to scripture all right so
[1:20:01] i believe that i don't just believe it i
[1:20:03] know that's what it is because you come
[1:20:05] to a belief and like i said before i
[1:20:07] believe that hannah's coming my daughter
[1:20:10] i believe she's coming but i've got to
[1:20:12] see her as she's here now if she's
[1:20:13] sitting on the front row praising god
[1:20:15] living a good christian life i don't
[1:20:17] have to have faith for that
[1:20:19] it's happened
[1:20:20] i gotta have for faith for something i
[1:20:22] can't see
[1:20:24] amen because if you can see it it's
[1:20:27] already happened right
[1:20:29] does it reveals it makes it manifest all
[1:20:31] right
[1:20:32] he's in that process all the way through
[1:20:34] so the same way with your children you
[1:20:36] say well what about
[1:20:38] what about
[1:20:40] god's had patience with you for how many
[1:20:42] years
[1:20:44] one more time god has patience with you
[1:20:46] for how many years amen
[1:20:48] you know what when you get to glory he's
[1:20:50] not going to ask you why it took you so
[1:20:51] long to be a christian
[1:20:53] no he's not going to ask you that
[1:20:55] when you when god says anything you
[1:20:57] believe it that's all you got patience
[1:20:59] well i asked him last night to heal me
[1:21:01] and i'm just as sick this morning oh my
[1:21:02] what patience
[1:21:03] god told abraham and 25 years later
[1:21:06] there wasn't even one sign actually it
[1:21:08] was worse
[1:21:10] he was still believing he was patient
[1:21:12] with god put him always before you
[1:21:15] let him be the next crossing thing you
[1:21:17] understand what that means he said put
[1:21:19] god out here and when you come to that
[1:21:22] put god right here and when you come to
[1:21:24] that crossing thing you put god right
[1:21:25] here you keep putting god out in front
[1:21:27] of you
[1:21:28] knowing that he's going to do it all
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:31] so let's look at the next one
[1:21:34] number 11.
[1:21:36] but look people there's no way to have
[1:21:37] patience but by trials
[1:21:39] all right
[1:21:40] to have godly patience you've got to
[1:21:43] have trials
[1:21:44] all right
[1:21:46] same uh statue of perfect man and we
[1:21:48] should have patience with one another
[1:21:51] all right we get we get so much
[1:21:52] impatient with one another we think we
[1:21:55] got to be like moses moses had patience
[1:21:57] with people look that's what caused them
[1:21:59] not to go over remember moses
[1:22:03] got emotional
[1:22:04] right
[1:22:06] he didn't do what god said
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:10] he smote the rock instead of speaking to
[1:22:13] the rock
[1:22:14] you know why because he got mad at them
[1:22:16] people that was behind him
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:19] but he didn't have the holy ghost to
[1:22:20] control that like you and i have the
[1:22:22] holy ghost to control that right same
[1:22:24] way with elijah and allah or elisha
[1:22:26] elisha would have never called those she
[1:22:28] bears on to those children if he would
[1:22:30] have had these virtues
[1:22:32] in his life all right but god was
[1:22:34] anointing him at the time to be a
[1:22:35] prophet in the old testament and that
[1:22:38] control tower had not went down in the
[1:22:40] inside yet everybody understand that
[1:22:42] okay
[1:22:43] that's why that's why the ones in the
[1:22:44] old testament can do things that we see
[1:22:47] that seems like it was wrong and it is
[1:22:49] wrong
[1:22:50] but god was showing him for examples
[1:22:52] like david having his best friend killed
[1:22:54] well now if you do that now
[1:22:59] you're going to hell
[1:23:01] if you don't repent
[1:23:03] but david had a repentant heart but he
[1:23:04] didn't have the new birth that new birth
[1:23:06] would have changed that man he would
[1:23:08] have never looked at bathsheba the way
[1:23:10] he looked at her if he had a new birth
[1:23:12] he would have turned his head away from
[1:23:14] it he would have loved uriah and
[1:23:16] everything would have been fine but for
[1:23:18] examples for an example it's what the
[1:23:20] bible gives us for in the old testament
[1:23:22] give us examples these examples are for
[1:23:24] us to live by all right so we know that
[1:23:27] david was anointed by god but when the
[1:23:29] anointing came off david he was just a
[1:23:31] normal human man just like the rest of
[1:23:32] us had desires and things like that so
[1:23:34] that caused him to do what he did but
[1:23:36] these are to control us now because
[1:23:38] we're required to come to a body chain
[1:23:41] but we're first required to come to
[1:23:43] adoption right all right to become in
[1:23:45] the line of adoption first you got to
[1:23:47] get in the family
[1:23:48] all right that's down at the bottom get
[1:23:50] in the family all right now once in the
[1:23:52] family god can
[1:23:53] raise you up with what faith you have
[1:23:56] what he said with what faith you have
[1:23:58] all right
[1:23:59] and with the faith that you have
[1:24:01] he will honor that faith because look
[1:24:04] to me
[1:24:04] this is faith this is faith and this is
[1:24:07] the apex of faith
[1:24:10] so you don't lose this is the apex of
[1:24:12] faith you are so believing all this is
[1:24:15] already in your life so god comes down
[1:24:17] and honors that we'll get into that you
[1:24:20] know couple services from now
[1:24:22] on the adoption of the headstone but we
[1:24:24] should have patience with one another
[1:24:25] let me finish real quick
[1:24:27] see that each member of the tabernacle
[1:24:29] become this i've tried to get this
[1:24:30] message over at the tabernacle to see
[1:24:32] that each member of the tabernacle
[1:24:33] becomes this it's hard to do i've
[1:24:36] tried to have patience in other words
[1:24:38] for 33 years he's been trying to preach
[1:24:40] that sermon
[1:24:42] for 33 years he's been trying to preach
[1:24:44] that sermon to the tabernacle to get him
[1:24:45] into place
[1:24:47] but he said see
[1:24:48] have patience right
[1:24:50] women still bob the hair still just the
[1:24:52] same but just have patience
[1:24:54] just have patience wait have to if you
[1:24:56] ain't got it don't try to build on this
[1:24:58] down here
[1:25:00] you must have patience and like i said
[1:25:02] there's no way to have patience no way
[1:25:04] to have patience
[1:25:06] but by trials
[1:25:08] all right let's stop right there and
[1:25:09] we'll uh
[1:25:10] well let's read this one i like this one
[1:25:12] too let's read it and then we'll

[1:25:25] truth

[1:25:28] jones or so-and-so said it didn't
[1:25:31] no you just keep going he said it'll
[1:25:32] happen how i don't know
[1:25:35] but it will happen he said so he
[1:25:37] promised it if he promised it it's going
[1:25:39] to happen that's all it can't waste you
[1:25:42] see that word said it can't waste you
[1:25:43] know what that means god doesn't have
[1:25:45] wasteful movement
[1:25:46] you and i have wasteful movement we'll
[1:25:48] have one thought about building a house
[1:25:50] over here and 10 minutes later we'll

[1:25:54] over here 10 minutes later we'll change
[1:25:56] it now god thought of this before the
[1:25:57] foundation of the world right

[1:29:31] of jesus

[1:31:37] we believe we need to go find us another

[1:31:41] we need to believe that god's here to do
[1:31:43] what he said he'd do
