Christian and did this morning and I'm sure he's probably on his way back so we need to keep him in prayer with all this rain and and weather going on so you love the Lord amen well then we have come to listen to see what he had to say so let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would again just one more time come Among Us Lord not be a bystander to record our thoughts and our ideas but be an active participant in the service father you take over you'll be the one that Lord does the singing does the playing that does the speaking that does the hearing father faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God we've come to a place in all of our Lives to where Lord It's 2015 who would have thought that it would have went this long but we're here Lord we want to get out of here because there's a lot of promises and things that are coming our way that that we need to line up before they get here the promise of a change the promise of adoption the promise of speaking the word all those promises we've got to go through a journey before we get there father we pray Lord now that you would help us through that journey be our guide if someone does not know you as their God Lord please do not let them sleep stir their water so much Lord till they realize that they're lost and on the way to a sinner's hell with no hope without you father I pray that you would just burn their heart because it's coming close to the time lord for the doors will be shut we're going to need these virtues we're going to need the things that you have already the provisions that you provided in the word we're going to need them then and not just ask for them at that time we're going to need them I pray now that you'll just be with us Lord bless us keep us safe be with the ones that are not here Lord the sick ones bless the ones Lord that are on the Foreign Fields doing their mission work we pray for them Father give them fruit for their labors bless each one of us here keep us strong give us a good shot of vitamin W called the word give us a shot of that Lord we won't need anything else just be with us now Lord take care of us protect us in Jesus name amen if anybody gets too cold hold our hands up except sister Gail and sister Joyce I always absolutely ignore both of them but sister gamble just put on her shawl now Joyce she's already got what she don't have a colonel Hallelujah it's 87 degrees in here that's the reason I'll never forget that day Danny me and you were at uh we were out west hunting in Kansas and sister uh brother Jim Schroeder's wife I mean honestly people candles this big around that come out you know they got a candelabra that comes out from the wall and goes up about this far and there's candles this big around right about that big around not little bitty one big candles we come in there you know when we first started hunting well the candles are kind of bent over like this they're about this tall and they're bent over we could tell why it was 80 something Danny was sweating like he couldn't he couldn't even see to eat it was so hot in that room it had bent those candles she had to take those candles and put them in the microwave and reheat them again to straighten them up and put them back up well they just fall over again it was 86 she said it's just 86 degrees in here just 86 degrees in here I don't think so but we're trying to escape a hotter place this is not too bad now at 70 something degrees so I I turned the air on just for a few minutes and if you want it turned off just walk over there and and touch it but uh second Peter one we're going to review a little bit and then I may have to do a little lengthy reading today but for the introduction this is it may seem boring to some of you but but the word of God should never be born a group of people stood for six hours because they heard a word they'd never heard before they found a set of Scrolls and they were so excited they stood for six hours it didn't say just the young ones did for six hours they said they all stood for six hours and listened to that word being read so I think we can uh we can praise God that we're not six hours long we've been we've sat through a few couple two three hour ones here with uh brother moat and some of the ones but you know what that's what we needed it was time to to pack the word in so so now we can we can try to do the same thing again but not do three hours worth of it so Simon Peter are servant Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power have given us all things that pertains unto life and godliness so we're going to be talking about life and godliness when we get into these virtues we're going to get into life lessons all right we're going to get into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that has won in the world through life now that's Peter's making a point here verse one through four he's making a point you got to be born again you got to have the divine nature of God Amen see now watch this this this this proves the whole thing where people think you got to get the new birth up there no you got to have a new birth to begin with because it says and besides this look at verse five and besides this what besides having the new birth because we're going to read sister Shepard's dreaming a little bit and and she was worried about she was born again she was born again but there were some things that was going on in that dream that will prove that we still need a cleaning out after we're born again okay being born again as the same person that wrote this Peter did and beside this giving all diligence in other words you can't be dilatory you got to have diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge ten percent Temperance patience to patience godliness the godliness brother kindness the brother kindness charity for if these things be in you there's that word if and abound overflowing they make you that you shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things as blind he cannot see it far off and has forgotten that he was Purge from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall amen you Lord that is blessing to the word go and be seated we're going to read Ephesians 4. we're just going to background here for a minute until it cools down up here and uh then we will uh begin the lesson for the afternoon we're still in the introduction we still want to set a background for what we want to speak on for the next several services Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some Apostles now for the ones that were not here this morning are the ones just clicked on uh Peter told us what to get he told us what to get at divine nature add to your faith adverts but he really never said how to get it he said you must obtain it so Paul picks up picks up Peter same Holy Ghost but Paul picks it up and says okay this is how you get it and he gave some Apostles some Prophet some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ see you can't edify the body if you don't have somebody's got to have these virtues working in life somebody asked me a question a little while ago said why you know that is that the reason we're still here yes somebody must have all these virtues working in their life go up to the Holy Spirit go up to love and be capped as a adopted son of God and then still something's got to happen you say what's going to happen well brother Branham got brother Branham was standing there just like this and he's in the grave he's waiting on someone to come to full maturity but maybe just not one person it needs to be all of us that's the reason we all are still here that's right the reason we're still here it's just the planes it's not that I've said many times before and I hope it rains home God didn't just put a day on a calendar and exit and say this is when I'm coming that's right he knew when the he knew when it would happen right but it's not a red letter day that he's got axed off it's when his people get ready right man it's when his people are at the place to where God can work in them them like he did in Adam and Eve I said Adam and Eve before the fall they were co-equal right because it's got to be Christ in this bride to finish the program right it can't just be one or the other for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and Christ was the fullness as we looked in the chart this morning that's the fullness of Christ The Headstone that man when he walked on the face of the Earth he was the stature of a perfect man amen all right he was the one that we looked to that we henceforth be no more children Ephesians 4 14 tossed to and fro and carried away that's our problem our problem is is we are still some still children we still like milk I still like milk but I don't drink it every day I like strong meat I it's like I told somebody not too long ago you know God somebody was talking about being a vegetarian I said God give me the wrong teeth for that that's right oh hey Benny hey he gave me incisors and he gave me canines canines are meat eaters Jesus eat fish that's a meat so I'm okay that we henceforth be no more children though toss to and fro now see if you're tossed to and fro just say look I'm a child I'm just a kid in God I'm just a child and you see that as you carry yourself on in life you see you know I've been back to this church 16 years now and um well it didn't seem like that long but it has been 16 years and you see people leave and come back and leave and come back or leave and don't come back well one thing's for sure they really never got settled or they don't have the Holy Ghost to start with all right because you toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the sleight of it didn't say man it says men so it's not just in one person and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive all right but speaking the truth in love may grow up see we henceforth being more children so we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so he is if he's the head of all things then we must come up to the head May grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together right and compacted not just put together I mean you really pound it together by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working and the measure there's a measure of every part maketh increase of the body onto the edifying of itself in love right right all right so we've come to a place to where then we looked this morning we were talking about the The Headstone uh if you would pull the pull the the full number one uh picture up brother Anderson brother Anderson's name doesn't get called much he's really the one that puts these things up here if he's not asleep there we go okay but this is the phone this is the full oh I'm sorry it's it's Sarah's father I told him I said when that baby's born you'll only be known from now on it's Sarah's father you won't be known as Anderson you'll be Brother Anderson you'll be Sarah's father so but you see this is the fullness this is Jesus Christ now we see that when he ascended and left that The Headstone was rejected by man of course he was rejected and killed but there was nothing for it to fall back on except for that Foundation of Faith the apostles and Prophets right the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost take that away on the day of Pentecost this came here the faith the revelation of the Son of God the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost in the hearts of the Believers but the son of man Ministry was taken away because man couldn't handle it and one thing's for sure the son of man is the complete revelation of God not just part revelation of God he was the fullness of the godhead bottling all right that's why you see all that is the fullness of the godhead bodily well at one time when he took that away then we come down here and we start at the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now remember they had these virtues working in their life the first three ages basically we can say the first three ages I said we wouldn't go get into church ages but really the first three Church ages had the complete Revelation right and when we get into it later on you'll see in brotherly kindness where they had all things common brother Brown said that was a brotherly kindness for the ages they all had all things common right and we'll get into it and we'll see if you have the same reaction those who did downstairs with brother what brother Brown said about brotherly kindness just make sure you get you bring your uh make sure you bring your checkbook and your savings account book bring you a house no mortgage the house the uh and all that bring it with you that day and we'll talk about it because that's what brother Brown said in in the first church age they had all things common is they gave all their money to one person and he distributed it out um so anyway bring cash no brain trade but bring cash but when you start down here at Faith that's the foundation then we were talking in word Zechariah it talks about zerubbable where's the rubable which was a real man he comes and builds the the Jerusalem back right the house of Israel he comes back but it's removal obviously isn't tight would be Jesus Christ or it would be the message of the hour because what happened was down in the church ages all this was eat down to a degree to where it couldn't work there was nothing but just like brother Brown said in that fourth Church age just to believe God you got killed right just to have faith just to believe on God you were killed for that now you know they didn't have to have a lot of these virtues but you know what they did look at that though they had patience so if you got the Holy Ghost you got a certain degree of these because I'm gonna read you a quote in a man where brother Ram said you don't even have to have the Holy Ghost to have certain degree of the virtues but not the virtues of God there's a difference these are not just well I knew a man that well if he didn't if he wasn't born again he didn't have none of that you got to be born again first that's what we established and then we read also in the scriptures just trying to background a few minutes that he was that he was The Headstone but as they rejected him he comes down and becomes the Cornerstone put that one out right there he comes down and becomes the Cornerstone because the removable had to build that thing square with the plummet and you take those and that's just a mini pyramid in itself but there's your Cornerstone and the Cornerstone started back down here he had to start with a building his removable had to start that from a foundation right right and then build the temple up because everything sets on the foundation but then in the end time he not only comes here he goes right back up and becomes The Headstone again that's why the headstone was brought back into the church in the end time did everybody follow that okay this morning if you have any questions like I said jot them down and maybe maybe two Sundays from now we'll have one Sunday afternoon where we'll have questions but if you've got any questions just you know put them on a piece of paper and lay them up here or give them to me or brother Dale one and we'll try to answer them but what I'm trying to do is is set a to make a statement number one that this is not just a good drawing this is not just a good drawing that it looks good and brother random knew what he was doing no the almighty gave him this right right he was sitting out under a tree squirrel hunting he said this chart is what God this is what came to me all right so zerubbabel in the form of the Elijah of the day had to knew them that he had to build this church back up to the faith of the fathers all right because it had been the the word effects of the word had been eroded by man's tradition and brother Brown called him loose ends right it was loose ends that man see this is there's no loose ends you see anything loose about this no no that's Firm Foundation you got all your you know you got everything tied together everything's exactly where it should be so that's the way God wants it he doesn't want it to have holes in it or anything like that he wants it to be a firm building and you know what it will be it will be God's already promised it it will be so it's going to be a firm foundation it's going to be exactly what God wants okay so everybody okay with that he became the head of the corner we read that this morning there in Ephesians 2 19 Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone verse 21 you don't have to pull it up in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into it holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God through the spirit so it has to come through the Spirit by fivefold Ministry to bring that headstone back into the place that it should be that's why the pyramids didn't have the head on it showing the crash would be rejected but Christ in being rejected he just went down there started building the foundation out of the same material that he had in the head right he started building that foundation and started going up then we read in First Peter about being Lively stones I'm just trying to catch up here and then become a stone of stumbling a rock of a fence if you're not in there if you're not in that pyramid then you're going to stumble over and I think a lot of people even Christians stumble over things right amen they stumble over things they stumble over and they don't uh they don't think things that are important or whatever but um can't make them you bring them to water but you can't make them drink then in Galatians it says after the faith has come we no longer under a Schoolmaster a Schoolmaster was what brought us unto Christ the school master was the do's and the don'ts to bring us there because honestly when we we're going to talk on a new birth next Sunday honestly in the New Birth people you know they say well I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit doing this I must have the new birth that's sanctification if you're still doing those things you're not even Sanctified you may be justified but you're not even Sanctified you're not even in order for this you're not even ordered for communion amen you're not order for doing anything you shouldn't be doing anything up here you shouldn't be doing anything if you're still doing those things and you're not born again we need born-again people we need people that God can work through hey there's all time we all had to be worked on we all have to be worked on we still have to be worked on but there's a time when you the old things are passed away the Bible says All Things become new a certain time where you guys say that's it and that don't happen to me no more you know you God can deal with you different ways but when you got a problem and you see that problem get wiped away and especially if it's a habit then you know it was God did it you didn't do it because you can't this is not alcohol it's anonymous we believe in Deliverance not suppression right all Alcoholics Anonymous does it just makes that demon go down just a little bit hides him a little bit makes you deny what you are they say once a drunk always a drunk no not when you get born again you're born again that thing will go out the door I promise you because I I I did I did the tobacco thing for 20 something years and the day I walked right there at that this spot right here I laid it down and the next day I didn't want it no more the next day I didn't want it no more okay so God knew that that was something I'd have to deal with though because you got to find out what God's got to deal with you also and then you got to but we gotta deal with it I'm not still dealing with it 16 years later it's still dead once something's dead is dead amen because remember we're going to talk about life and godliness all right that's what the statue of perfect man is life and godliness so it's going to talk about our life and the things that we do even after you say after you're born again absolutely after you're born again brother Brown said Satan turns every gun on you and man he'll start he'll start blowing it wasn't that I wasn't tempted about what I did I still had tobacco you know how cigarette smokers were those you smoke cigarettes you had one here you had one in the pocket you had two in your car you made sure you didn't run out you had them stuck everywhere same way with chewing tobacco and anything else drinking or whatever you're going to hide stuff somewhere and you know you always get around a bunch of guys and they always say hey here you know and they throw you something or beer or whatever you know but when you say no and you may know and you you know that that thing's gone right because then the other time you do it right right but when you know that thing's gone when you know that Demon's dead see what I've done is when that demon was dead see I don't have to go back and say well I'm worried about don't worry about that one go the next demon because I promise you there's a line of them if you made your seat was just one but they line them back there somewhere right one dies one pops up one dies one pops up oh so it doesn't just happen to me well praise the Lord all right so on the Statue of a perfect man let's go to that first quote and get started right here now we're approaching the Seven Seals we've just finished the seven Church ages and this is the message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's going to be in that church age that Eternal Church age at the end of the seal so now let us read first Peter and he continues reading that let's go to paragraph 35. you scroll it on up brother Brad was reading that in paragraph 35 says notice he's saying that I have obtained this Faith come out Peter and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like Precious Faith so see you got to be born again that that answers the question right there right it's not the Holy Spirit up here that we're dealing with right now it's the holy spirit that we're dealing with down at the bottom of the pyramid that we'll talk about next Sunday getting us into the body and getting us in line for service okay right because remember sanctification is clean and set aside for service the Holy Ghost is putting you in service well in service is going to start putting you up giving you these virtues if you want them if you want them it's not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in Christ and he reads on up let's go on up just get save time go to the paragraph 36. now let that soak in real deep now preaching this morning just not preaching just teaching divine nature because this is the divine nature of God if you want to characterize God in any way that's why this is important if you want to say well how do you know what God is that's God that's the virtue of God the knowledge of God the temperance of God the patience of God the brotherly kindness of God the holy spirit of God and the love of God it's all God right there's no devil in there anywhere there's no place for Satan anywhere in that all right that's why we're still here because we still leave a place for the devil right somebody being amen or somebody owe me it doesn't matter it's the truth anyhow but look he talks about divine nature verse in number 37 see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement so they must be required there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ now it's laid out here so there's if you want to be more like Christ it's going to be laid out in the Statue of a perfect man amen now it's laid out here every Christian talk about old veterans so let's go to 1A now this is one we stopped on this morning so now let's bring it up just a little bit more let's go to 1A statue a perfect man I haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world having escaped that the lust the corruption of the world you're above that now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that's escaped these things see the corruption of the world and besides this giving all diligence he read the scripture add to your faith version The Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance tempers patience patience Godless godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity right right now he has given us the outline here what to do know how to do it now as I said we're all trying to come closer to God that's why I chose this message this morning for the church all right so it's not for the world this is for the church all right let's go to quote number two all right quote number two is the statue of perfect man paragraph 69 we're just going to kind of read a few this is going to be kind of long but watch what he's talking about what is the Tabernacle now a body God tabernacling in a body God wants up high when he comes down on a mountain even if a bullock or cow touched the mountain he must be killed God is Holy now remember that's the same God that was back there the same God's supposed to be in you okay all right last evening when these angels covered their faces holy seraphims with holy faces don't even know what sin means and they have to cover their face in the presence of God cover their feet and humility now holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain where God was then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us amen all right come out of the blood to us through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood watch now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world that's obvious we're all sitting here we know how we all got here all right the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit right that's right then we become into the divine nature of God we come into that then we become a dwelling place for God everybody see that same amen amen that's what it means now let's go to paragraph 75. know how that God is in his church the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ right carrying on his ministry either believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while in the world see me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world see there it is carrying on on his work now God or the Bible says here that Stephen spoke of Solomon building a temple and the most I don't dwell in temples made with hands so this is not a temple made with hands this is actually this is not a building it's a person all right it's a person it's not a building it's a person for Heaven is my Throne Earth is my footstool and where's the place of my rest well it's in you let me answer that question right but he doesn't want to just rest in you he wants to use you all right he doesn't just want to rest he wants to use you but a body has now prepared me amen there you are a body has thou prepared me scrolled all the way up if you don't mind so we can the ones in the back can't see it God dwells in the stature yes not statue stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting oh how we could stay on that till you would almost suffocate and hear from me notice God has always at all times reflected himself in man always at all times reflected himself in man didn't want him to work himself in an animal right right didn't want to reflect himself in the stars or this great ball of Earth he wants to reflect himself in a man because what we're Made In His Image we're his children right so he wants his children to have what he has amen now let's go to number three this is a good one I like this one in the next few now Peter is outlining something here for us that how to get there amen okay so he's telling us how to get there all right now I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be Christian right now we just were teaching Sunday school and that's true there's some have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christian but that doesn't that won't do it right it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself be better to stay a blackbird right see when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he's just simply out of place all right when you're trying to pretend and now let's go to 3A where brother Branham explains this in my in my words he explains it because what's he talking about unless we suffer with him this is in chapter four of the smyrnan church age now my computer it didn't have a it didn't have a paragraph number so I don't know what paragraph number it is but you ought to be able to look it up unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him see these are sufferings like brother Keith 3 said this is the trials of life this is the things we must do because look people we got to be Overcomers we got we got to overcome something okay you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never never made without suffering this is the characteristics are the character of almighty God right these virtues are the characters so when I say virtues you say character in your brain when you say virtues you say character character virtues same thing okay because it's your characteristics character is a victory not a gift so he's not going to give you these just because you're a Christian a man without character can't Reign right right because power apart from character right it's satanic you remember the Simon the Sorcerer I believe it was he he followed Paul and uh and Stephen or somebody or Paul and somebody around and he saw him doing Mighty signs and wonders he said let me buy that I want to buy that from you I want to I want to get that from you and the movie that sister Johnny gave me it was really neat because uh Peter turned around and said God knows your heart and that's what it is God knows your heart he knows you won't use it right right so therefore he won't give it to you right same thing with that power without character is satanic we have the power we have the Holy Ghost that's the most power you ever need but without the character of God you'll use it wrong Elisha had the power he didn't have the new birth but he had the power right God did what Elisha said right if Elisha would have had character to go with that power he would have never called those she Bears to eat those 42 children exactly that's the difference in the Old Testament and the New Testament David all those ones that you see God's power but they just didn't have the character to go along with it right so power without character is satanic right in other words you'll use it wrong right okay but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and he sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that we will be revealed and us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him because look people our human character is contrary to God our human character is contrary to God so God must change that and it must be a victory it must be a suffering that we must go through because it's not a gift character is a victory amen when you come to a place to where you see that God's dealing in your life and like some downstairs with uh most everybody had a problem with temperance Mr Johnny's got her hand up kind of like this but when you know that that person Cuts you off usually it's road rage Satan has got in our cars now like he wasn't there before but road rage is one thing that really you know it upsets people and sister Johnny said a lot of times that would happen to her because she's from New York but she don't mind me telling it but she's overcome that but you know what she had to go through it right to overcome it you can't just walk through you can't just walk through life and the rose bushes just clear back as you walk through yeah that yeah that's what's going to happen the rose bushes are just going to park and you're going to just walk right through and they're going to be throwing cotton at your feet character is a victory not a gift so God's gonna put you through that and the reason listen if you'll take a test like this the Reason God puts you through the test he knows that you'll pass the test or if you don't he's going to give it to you again until you do pass it exactly right because remember he doesn't have anyone fail now you can fail yes yes God won't fail you can fail you can fail and stop anytime you want to because I'll read it here in just a minute but Power without character is satanic right you have all the power in the world if you can't use it right it's not of God right right but Power with character is fit to rule and he wants us to rule and reign with him so let's go to number four still in the Statue of a perfect man paragraph 94. went out and then I'm talking to it like what brother Brown was talking about the the black bird that sticks the peacock feathers in that's power without character he's a bird the peacock's a bird the black Bird's a bird they're in the same family the birds it's just that the peacock I mean the the old ugly Blackbird wants to look like the peacock so he takes peacock feathers and he starts sticking them in well somewhere along the line they're gonna fall out and he's just going to be a blackbird well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be chain see and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now so you don't have to worry about the feathers it takes care of itself all right I mean you know a lot of these people are uh you know they say well I always was a I always was a wheat plant well I've got quotes from Brother Brown said he was a kookaburra and had to be transformed right I think it's I thought it was it would be real easy for God to just say well you always was that yeah foreign no but for me to realize I was a black bird right but I want to be a peacock but it's not that I'm going to take and stay a crow or Blackbird and act like a peacock no God's gonna say you won't look like that peacock I'll change you into that peacock if that's what you want to be if that's what you want to be I'll put you over there because remember it all comes from the inside out brother Brown said he changed me from a from a cuckoo bird to a wheat plant we'll we'll talk about that maybe next week but um roll it up it's talking about a hog bent a Hog's a hog it doesn't matter what you do you can push the tuxedo suit on him and he runs right back into the water because he's a hog now notice you must be born again that is changed right right there's got to be a change now how many times he said that in the past several several quotes there's got to be a change you can't act like you acted even six months ago to certain degrees all right now there's certain things dirt and characters that we're going to have to deal with characters that we have that are traits that Donnie likes cars and I like to hunt that don't make us different that just makes humanly that he likes cars and I like and I like hunting I might listen I might endure him talking about cars and he may endure me talking about hunting but there's in these virtues that's not a well maybe I'll have a little bit of this virtue no you gotta have the virtue of God Amen it's God's virtue it's not human nothing right right if it was human anything we can manufacture it that's right and I think what we're doing is a lot of times we're trying to manufacture it can't do that you can't manufacture God because power without character is satanic now let's read this quote right here everybody kind of getting the gist of it watch one more time notice you must be born again I really don't see how people I you know we've seen daddy Brothers been with some people that you know turn the pyramid upside down and all this stuff and try to get the Holy Ghost here and there let's just see what the prophet says right now you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith faith is the foundation it's real wide you got to have a lot of it right so that's right so you see on my chart here I've got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please God you say that word impossible right right without faith it's impossible you cannot please God any other way but by faith that's right all right for without faith it's impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him there's your reward see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it so don't try to go up this pyramid without first knowing that you're born again know that you've got the faith of God and then when God gives the faith to you who is it it's yours right so then it says add to your faith all right what is sin unbelief watch here this is what I want you to see this he Nails it right here this to me nails the whole thing what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being so let's cut everything out except two things exactly that's either doubt or faith not doubt and Faith doubt our faith one or the other right you're possessed right you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise he nailed it right there according to how much Faith you have is how high you can rise that's what he's talking about right is how high you can rise you say well I've got this temper my grandpa had it my granddaddy hadn't all that stuff and I've got it and ain't nothing to do about it well guess what ain't nothing going to do about it either right there's nothing God can do about it if that's what you're saying right right in other words it's like Daddy said you pet that devil you don't want to get rid of it but the requirements are that we do get rid of it amen amen the requirements are that we live in brotherly kindness godliness patience and all these things and we'll get into that later I just want to make sure that we see that this is number one very important it's the centerpiece of the message which takes us into the seals because the seals is for the Redemption of the body well if you can't get these things under control here how in the world that's why it tickles me with with ministers in the in the message that are that are preaching the third poll and preaching on The Headstone and preach that's good but if they got the virtues working in their life are they at the faith of the fathers or do they know that that they have so much brotherly kindness and godliness until God is doing the thing in their life that they're supposed to right okay okay cause that's got to come first God's plan is not is you get Faith and then you just jump all the way up to the headstone it's not but remember the third pull is the opening of the word but so was the first and second pull all right and then I've heard people preach at third pool is a new birth well the new birth contains the third pull it's the third pull is not all the new birth yeah nobody understand that let me say it one more time the third pull is in that new birth that you have okay it's in there but it's not totally all it right because if you say that then then Paul had the third pull working in his life in the first church age which he did not irenius Martin Columbus and that's what I want to I want explain something here we were looking at the doing the dimensions of the city and we'll get into that you know a long time from now the city Foursquare that's going to be a big place to live probably 90 percent of the people born again Christian bride with white raiment with the crown with being priests and Kings all the things that it says about us never even seen this chart never heard of William Branham never heard of the message of the hour yeah Paul didn't know anything about brother Ryan Wesley didn't know nothing about brother Branham but yet they're going to be there what I'm saying is this this part of this message is not new it's been around since Paul was here and God has made provision for this to work in people's life all down through the seven Church ages the only thing we as the Bride of this day is standing needing is this I sure we need this but unless if we get this that's the next thing that's coming that headstone to be put back onto the church bringing that man back brother Dale's the fullness of the godhead bodily now if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily 2000 years ago the man I'm talking about him he was the fullness of the godhead bothered two thousand years ago if that was the son of man Ministry and that's the son of man that took a change that same man's got to be back here I swear we're missing it that same man's got to be back here amen but not in one person anymore because when he came back on the day of Pentecost he divided himself and it and Paul there's no way that Paul could have the fullness of the godhead bodily Irene is Martin all the way up until this age now we can have the fullness that that means that that man can come back in a group of people living in a group of people but the son of man Ministry had to be back sure he lived in the people down Through the Ages Son of God as the spirit God we're going to see me no more I read it the world see me no more but you'll see me but in the end time he's got to come back not literally as a person but he's so literal in his bride because all the other ages couldn't put it together they'd lose something here there'd be a piece off here there'd be a piece of the building they couldn't do a Paul said I looked through a glass Darkly but he said what I see Jesus in other words I'm looking to the author and finisher of my faith but we're standing right here looking at the altar in the finisher of the faith right here today the son of man Ministry now that's getting way on Down the Line because we got to have all these first but the importance of that is we can't have that without having this this has got to be back in action and it is but not in his fullness God wants everybody to be adopted God wants everybody to to have enough godliness and patience and Temperance to act like God the book of Ephesus remember they were called Christians because they acted like the man that walked on the Earth black brother what brother William say he's talking about being Christians or being religious the devil is religious but he can't be a Christian right there's no way the devil can be christ-like now he can be close but he can be very religious so I don't want to be called a religious person come on the people in Ephesus were called Christians because the people looked at him and said you act just like that man that was here 40 years ago or 50 years ago and that's the way we've got to be we've got to be to where we act like that man that was walking on the face of the Earth 2000 years ago that's power with character amen right right that's power with character everything's coming together in the end time we can't short ourselves but even as we come up to the new birth that's not all God requires right he requires more because we do have memory reason conscious affection and Imagination we've got that Spirit realm that we have to deal with because remember in your soul it's either Faith or doubt not faith and doubt one more time it's not faith and doubt right it's Faith or doubt okay you doubted when you were born and come up and before you got born again you were a doubter right then when Faith come you become a believer it's pretty simple but the people in the message most of them have faith and doubt in there can't have faith and doubt right it's Faith or doubt now what happens is you may have you got faith inside there but that doubt comes out a little bit into that next Realm because where do you doubt from now your memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where you doubt from if you're born again in your soul that Soul can't doubt right right but it's got to go through so many filters to get down in there I'm trying to find that quote where brother Brown said somehow the Holy Ghost gets into your soul but yeah it's not worded right but he said somehow he said it takes a miracle and that's what it does it takes a miracle because you're a miracle all right it's a miracle how this thing works so what we're going to do now is we've set them we've set the tone the introduction is that we need this it's a requirement it's it's required for graduation so it's a required subject it's something that we must have and we must teach it correctly but it also requires you to have a desire to want it right okay and if you have the new birth you do have the desire to want it right if you have the new birth you might you've got to have that desire now whether you suppress it or not it's your business it's according to how much Faith you got is how high you'll go all right because remember brother Madam preached the message doors indoors you let God in your house right right so you're born again he let you let God in the house but you say God now don't go behind that door right there he made it doubt and fear and self or something else he made several different things he's because remember he said the Holy Ghost is timid see if it'd be me and you see this is power without character you walk in somebody's house you say what's behind that door yeah what we got behind that door let me see what's behind that door right not the Holy Ghost he said you got the door shut that's fine I won't do anything I'll wait on you because brother Ramsay he's a gentleman now if you say okay you can go in that door you open that door and you open that door and you open that door and you open that door if you don't want him to take your ungodly temper away from me he won't right if that's what you got to deal with we all got certain things we all got all these to deal with it's just certain levels we have to deal with them at all right um I told him downstairs Temperance and patience is probably two of the worst they're sitting right there beside each other and you you can kind of interchange them but let's read this I think they're going to pull it up this is on Blasphemous names and it's a pretty long read but I want you this is Brother Branham everybody has ever read sister Shepard's dream sister Shepherd's Dream came before before the statue of perfect man was preached but he said and I don't know if I got it in here I kind of edited some of this out for saving time but what happened was she told Brother Brown of the dream right before he preached statue of perfect man but they didn't have it written down where he could read it so he waited till the next week on Blasphemous names and read it and saw that how it went so well with what he was preaching the statue of perfect man so let's read it I think they have it back there it's kind of a long read but you know about 15 minutes we should be done I'm gonna try to keep holding to my hour and 10. Blasphemous names Jeffersonville 1962 1104 it was the week after he preached the week after he preached it Anderson you sleep sister Skipper's Dream It's about there somewhere I'll start reading some of it now I'm backgrounding this so that you will see when the sister's dream is being told now these things here absolutely must be in the Christian before the holy ghost ever seals them amen you see that what he's talking about he's still got his chart up he'll refer to it in a minute he's still got his chart of the Statue of a perfect man up all right so he's referring to that chart brother Joey may not have it on there so that brother Joe knows where it is so now these things here absolutely must be in the Christian before the holy ghost ever seals them now he's not talking about the new birth he's talking about having the virtues and having the virtues sealed in you all right before this comes down on top and makes a complete unit everybody see what he's saying all right now our sister's dream now she was worried whether she had the holy ghost or not when she laid down across the dewfold where her husband was reading a paper and she got little ones as I have and they're always making noise and so in this she fell asleep for approximately 10 or 15 minutes and she dreamed she never could understand it or get it all together from a year ago almost I'm sorry it was a year ago until this message paragraph 98 there you go almost until this message was taught then while I was teaching it it all came back to her that's what it was and she dreamed that she was praying all right keep going up to uh 99. there you go all right 99 there you go she was walking the floor first before she dreamed and ringing her hand saying Lord have I got the Holy Ghost can you prove it to me prove to me some says some say it's because that or that I shouted or some said because I spoke in tongues and we believe in all that but have I really got it I believe in all those things paragraph 100 keep reading those verses speaking in tongues shouting all kinds of demonstrations I believe in every bit of that but if it's there without this I believe he's talking about this because he's still got his chart there if it's there without this there's something wrong see and I see you see you you got a shell notice and she was worried about it she just laid down across the dewfo which her husband was reading and she went to sleep and she dreamed she was up on the mountain now remember I want you to listen for a minute she dreamed she was up on the mountain but she didn't stay up there she came back down okay don't want you to get because some people think well she was up on the mountain she had all these virtues no just watch what he's watch what he's saying you have to kind of read slow and I think slow so it kind of helped me and she dreamed she was up on the mountain and in this mountain the best I haven't got the paper before me but I think it's like this she dreamed that she saw a rock box like a framework sitting right on top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen now think of the scene of a man standing right here because the Box the box is going to be right here we're going to keep reading but the box is right here because he's gonna he's gonna nail it with brotherly kindness so the box is right here there's a man standing here on this mountain pouring water into the box everybody got that same man pouring water into a box right on top of that all right so a large man standing with work clothes on sleeves rolled up Banning the most pure water she ever seen pouring into this box this Rock Box sitting on top of the mountain and The Rock Box would not hold the water and it rolled right out of there and just boiled up listen boiled up trash and sticks now you're gonna find out a minute she's already born again but where the water is coming in is right here and what's it doing it's bubbling out and pouring down over the mountain so you think we still got rocks and sticks in US yeah we still got rocks and sticks but that's what this statue of perfect man is doing it's not cleaning your soul out your souls as clean as it'll ever be hey if you're born again your souls is clean it don't need this but it's so captured by what we have on the outside it's it's like a capsule well the the ways of sin and all the things of the world and the junk that we go go through there's a lot of filters for it to go through but the the Holy Ghost is not it's not boiling the trash out of her soul it's boiled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and boil it out and rolled it down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her right and then she asked why the Box didn't hold it and the man said this is not water this is the Holy Ghost so the man's pouring the Holy Ghost down into here and what's it boy it's boiling all the trash out and down the mountain George ball in the trash I I love this because and I know brother Brandon was shouting inside for sure nothing will hold it and said then he went back and got another big bucket and it was full of honey and poured the honey in there said now it will hold this and she thought that the box was a rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it right all right she turned and went down the mountain so see she had to go back down she went got down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain and looked back she saw five streams of pure Crystal Water not contaminated by the things that it had went through still pure and clean coming swiftly then it slowed down almost faded out and she was wondering would it ever reach the bottom of the mountain five streams and she woke up I think that's just about as close to being right isn't that sister Shepard because she was there in the meeting now no more than I picked up the letter and opened it before I read it I saw her dream that's what a prophet does the prophet sees the vision all right seize the dream that's the way dreams are interpreted now many of you has come to me with dreams and say things to me about dreams I say wait a minute you never told it all see and go back and pick it up then if you can't tell what you dream how you know the interpretation is right or not see you've got to see that's what Daniel got into with interpreting dreams Daniel interpret those dreams he would see the dreams and he'd tell them the dream and they knew exactly that it was true because he told them the very Vision that they had in Daniel back in the in the Old Testament you've got to you've got to see the dream a vision has to show the dream and when you see the dream that the person dreamed and can tell them before they tell you then you know the interpretation all right now here is the interpretation of her dream so it's got to be right because you just said it was she was bothered about the Holy Spirit now there's so much that she's seen the box in the top of the mountain was the rock rock box is Rock confession now like Jesus said in the scripture he said Peter said who Jesus said who does man say I the son of man am one said Thou Art Elias and Moses and so forth and he said but who do you say I am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now we're going to go back to here now some people say now the Catholic Church says the Roman Catholic Church said that his The Rock was that Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll be on my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it they said it was upon Peter and Peter was that rock because Peter means a little Stone upon this little Stone I'll build my church and upon Peter they Apostolic secession they built the church then the Protestant Church says that's wrong that it was upon himself he built the church talking about Jesus now not to be disagreeable but to me my way of seeing it it's both wrong because he never built it upon Peter neither did he build it upon himself right right because he was just not a man but it's upon Peter's revelation of who he was exactly okay Peter's revelation of who he was all right Dr Christ is under the Living God bless the Lord thou Simon son of Jonas flesh and blood has not revealed this to you some Seminary see but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you there Peter Upon This Rock of confession upon this Revelation I'll build my church and that's been each Church age has had that rock confession on up to this rock confession of the laodicea right up to the top because remember when he poured the water down in it went down in here and he'd come back out so the Holy Ghost covered every age and now you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as the holy church or a holy organization right the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad Renegades indifferent and everything else so an organization will not hold you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the holy spirit is poured out on individuals it's the individual so therefore the rock this Latter Day Pentecostal Church which has received the Holy Spirit they did at the site they did have received the Holy Ghost as they did at the first all down Through the Ages they received the Holy Spirit but not in the measure that they have it now right okay because it's a restoration of the first just like we took the picture with the with the Cornerstone it's restoring it back to the headstone all right as we take the candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they lit the first candle and it went higher and higher got dimmer and dimmer then comes back again see first and last and so forth now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church but the church body itself is all together like the this Tabernacle will say that's where she comes to church this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost that's right but not the church in the body a group therefore it runs out but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church so who was it he just didn't want to tell the people it was him it was him standing there with his sleeves rolled up in the work clothes all right he just didn't say but he said the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does balls it up now now the honey represented brotherly love that's the last thing see this is we're going to see in later on this is your hinge point this is if you can't get past that because look The Headstone won't fit down here it fits right there so you got to have that all right so that's what he's saying right here watch now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age I just got through telling see a brother kindness the angel we live in now you might say look I sure I don't I don't like brother Neville or so don't like brother Jones I don't like brothers so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart's broke and just nearly killed you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feel for one another but to maintain in a group of people look he's saying something watch we can obtain brotherly kindness and feelings for one another see but to maintain in a group of people right bunch of people right to maintain a group of people he's saying it's going to be hard right why do you care for that brother because you've broken bread with him here at the altar or you will tonight your fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and you might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with but you just kind of stay which you ought to uh to do but shun him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill your or that sister I'm an old man I was once young now I'm old I've seen it down through the age do that hear people say I won't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey sticks now look here's what he's telling her now in so much that she come down from there down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious water was gushing over Hills in five strands now five is the number of grapes j-e-s-u-s-f-a-r-t-h-g-r-a-c-sc five is the number of Grace five strains were pouring from up here at the trough down through here each one of these ages has that rock confession the saints were sleeping waiting waiting waiting to see on till this age but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and will seal up his church now you're not talking about the New Birth here he's talking about that Holy Spirit right there this is jumping a little head but this is the whole dream we're going to tell the whole dream and then we'll start over again but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and we'll seal up the church then the church will be raptured it will be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things you follow me now congregation says amen now she was wondering now in Her Dream she was wondering would this little stream with this little stream ever get to the bottom see it was drying up now being that she herself now here's what I want to get to you now she herself was wondering about her own self did she have the Holy Ghost now I shouldn't saying this a few days ago thinking that the church would be spiritual enough to catch it and maybe I better turn this tape off right now because I don't want it to get out amongst Brethren but you could speak with tongues you can shout You Can Dance you can cast out Devils do anything you want to and still not have the Holy Ghost didn't them disciples come back rejoice and shouting becomes the devil was subject to them and Jesus right among them was Judas amen did not Jesus say in that day when he come that day many will come to me and say Lord have not I cast out devils in your name done many mighty works and I'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you these things are not indications of the Holy Spirit right by their fruits you shall know them right now you say brother Branham do we should we speak in tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues listen but these gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumble block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God exactly right you see that those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumble block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God this has to be first amen I believe he's pointing to that because Seacoast said and when you have faith virtue and all these temples patience Godless and brotherly kindness then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from the side here is the thing that you have to have first I think he's pointing to that here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you cannot imitate them they've got to be god-sent and God born right imitation only causes confusion and that's our problem we've had a lot of imitation and a lot of confusion it's like I said could you imagine seeing a buzzard sitting there with a dove feather stuck in his wing saying see I'm a dove he's not a w the Buzzard could you imagine a black bird with a peacock feather in his wings say see that's something that he's stuck in but it has to come from the inside out and it produces Christianity God by the power of the Holy Spirit our sister had her feet wet when she got to the bottom all of us know Sister Shepherd to be charitable and he talks about opening up her house and all that oh God accepted that her foundation part see look she fed the people she shared form look whatever it is they'll feed them do anything they can to help them oh God oh God accepted that her foundation part that's down here this is the foundation part he accepted that all right and here's now get this lesson here's what's wrong with the I turn on for this here's what's wrong with the Branham Tabernacle you see there's two different kinds of Faith right there's two different kinds of virtue as I had it the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance one thinks it's prohibition they got that ain't the kind of temperance that God's talking about it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper you've got and things of that side fast back fuss patience and so forth there's a mockery of it a pretend to be a nature given Faith a nature given virtue there's a nature given Temperance all these things are nature given and the biggest part of our faith look at the biggest part of our faith is mental faith okay by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there's a Godly spiritual face I believe he's talking about up there coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there's a Godly spiritual faith then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word amen amen no matter what anything else says it only recognizes a word because in the beginning was the word words with God the Word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual revelation and upon this Foundation I'll build my church not upon a mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation when them streams of Grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual Revelation I'll build my church in case they won't Prevail against it that shows they would be against it but it'll never Prevail oh what a glorious thing now you see the faith these five strengths he's talking about bringing a piece of chalk to to do some writing but what but the five streams you see coming down through here tempers this together it's been the Holy Ghost holy spirit that made the Ephesian church it was the Holy Spirit that birth this morning church the holy spirit that give the Perkins Church the entire church in the Dark Ages it's the Holy Spirit that's building that bride built that bride the elect that's pulled out of all the organization systems down Through the Ages like that there's an elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit has called out the elect and it's been the Holy Ghost in This age that age that age he keeps going that that that that on up to the top the Holy Spirit and now as in the individuals these virtues and things are knowledge and Temperance is added to our faith then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today may you see here I got some text wrote down here let's see how the picture drawn out for a dream you can't see it from there now coming from the Holy Spirit what comes then when he will give it to you Supernatural faith spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word so how are you going to get the virtues only by the word amen all right no matter what anybody else says it don't it don't do no good that's all that only knows the word if somebody says the date of Miracles has passed that Faith only knows the word somebody says there's no such thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost that Faith only knows the word that's real spiritual Faith you see see it only knows the word then that was number one that number one coming to you your mental Faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith then the spiritual Faith only recognizes the word then he talks about two three four and all the way down all right from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ then you become one amen get these things out of my way it's hard on your arms talk about something else you become one see you and Christ live together at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me I and you and you and me see that's the sealed unit right right see your Soul's sealed in when you get the new birth right your soul is sealed in with God Satan sailed out God sealed in but that's not in your memories and conscious affection imagination in that Spirit Realm because remember this thing out here is memory reason I mean is a seed tastes feel smelling hair it only reacts to those two zones inside right it has it does not it's actually amoral just like the brick this body of mine can't sin that's right that's right unless I make it that's right right think about that think about it but our problem is our second realm memory reason conscious effects and Imagination that's where we have to deal with these and that's what we're going to deal with each one then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now he's talking about right here now that's why he put that Holy Spirit right there because it's got to seal all this in right all right and then they are Vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become Vindicated not Sons and Daughters of God but Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God because you know you're a Son of God or a daughter of God right here right but you're a Vindicated son and daughter of God the world knows the world knows who you are you know why they kill Peter and them because they were Vindicated because they had this right here where I mean Peter had this in his life he was Vindicated that's why they killed him right because he was a Vindicated Son of God you and I have not only just got to have the new birth which is number one requirement but the requirement now is is to let that new birth work out that's right let that new birth work out right and it's like I was talking to a a brother the other day he said I can't stop X or what you know put it whatever your problem is or his was I can't stop acts I said well if it you know if it was you know something and he I said well they don't bring them to your house and give them to you you got to go buy them and I said you don't have people buying them for you so you're the one that goes and buys them cigarettes or whatever right they don't bring them to your house I've never seen them deliver them to your house you gotta go get them just like you got to go obtain these virtues you have to go you have to Brother Brian said you have to go out on Satan's territory right you have to go out there so it's your free moral agency that goes out there and does the things and brother Brandon said one time he said if you're stingy do the vice versa you say well how's that you say well it's a demon well it's all a demon demons are talking to you right now okay demons are talking to you right now they're real but brother Brown said just do the vice versa if you stand you start giving money away if you got to go to the convenience store to buy you some cigarettes just need to quit going to convenience store or go over to the chewing gum aisle instead of going over there until God delivers you from that right right because remember you're not going to get rid of it unless you want to get rid of it nothing you do you're not going to get rid of nothing if you pick that thing and let it bother you you won't get rid of it if you like it right what God's got to do is is God's got to preach the thing out of you that's how you cast out Devils right right the word of God is how you cast out devil but these virtues are there people listen these virtues are there they're in you they're just ready to be manifested right right they're ready god listen God does not mind for us to call him and ask him but the Bible says speak to this mountain right the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it doesn't say pray for them doesn't say shake them doesn't say knock them down and God's not death you don't have to scream and you know what I never heard of brother Branham or even Jesus Christ screaming at the Devil right I've heard preachers scream people and kick them and and that might be all right but I've never Jesus the demons are even so much when Jesus walked up to the demons they said you want us to leave he wants to leave in other words while you come here before your time you want us to leave and he said yeah he said leave and they said well can we go don't let's cast us out can we go over there in the swine Jesus said go on Jesus wasn't messing with him he knew who he was he didn't have to shake Legion and scream at him he said right what'd the Bible say go that's all Jesus said was go makes it Go and the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from me so how are you going to cast out devil resist him right resist that urge to do the things that you used to do before next week we'll get into Lord willing into justification and sanctification to get us into the body so that we can start talking but what we wanted to do today was just an introduction to show you number one how important this is right that is that it's not a it's not a what you call those things that you took it's not an elective remember in school you had things you had to take then you had some electives like basket weaving and all them football players take all that you know pottery and all that stuff but there's a required subject to graduate this is not an elective this is a required subject to graduate so we got to have these and you know what we got to graduate man brother boy a bless your name page 48 in the black nothing like 48.
