[3:37] for saving our souls for guiding us and
[3:40] leading us and God understanding we pray
[3:42] that you would just have your way with
[3:44] each one of us forgive our sins cleanse
[3:46] us of all our unrighteousness you said
[3:49] nor that you sent your word and healed
[3:51] us so we depend upon that and we're Lord
[3:54] tonight we will try our best to speak
[3:56] what you've given unto us and we we
[3:59] depend upon you then to come on the
[4:01] scene and make it manifest have your way
[4:03] with each and every one of us and keep
[4:05] your little bride around the world
[4:06] centered upon one thing and that's your
[4:09] word we love you and we thank you in
[4:11] Jesus name amen
[4:15] will be in Romans 8.
[4:18] and we'll go to Revelations 3.
[4:22] Romans 8 28.
[4:25] and we know that all things work
[4:26] together for good to them that love God
[4:28] to them who are thee called according to
[4:30] his purpose
[4:31] for whom he did for no he also did
[4:34] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:37] image of his son that he might be the
[4:39] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[4:41] whom he did predestinate them he also
[4:44] called and whom he called then he also
[4:47] justified in whom he justified them he
[4:51] and whom he justified them he also
[4:53] glorified what shall we then say to
[4:56] these things what could be said to all
[4:58] of that
[4:59] if God be for us who can be against us
[5:02] amen let's go over to Revelations 3
[5:08] and verse 14. and at the angel of the
[5:11] Church of the lady of sin that's this
[5:13] age this is the last age this is the
[5:15] number seven anybody order no because
[5:18] the lady of SIA means people's rights so
[5:20] you ought to know that but however
[5:21] things going around the world today you
[5:24] know of everybody and what they're doing
[5:25] but it said unto the angel of the Church
[5:27] of the lady of sins right these things
[5:30] say at the amen the faithful and true
[5:32] witness the beginning of the creation of
[5:35] God you may be seated the Lord have his
[5:38] and his Blessing to the word
[5:41] now we've been studying for quite a
[5:44] while on the thought of how does God
[5:47] predestinate
[5:49] and we've seen that he predestinates by
[5:52] foreknowledge
[5:55] he desired that everybody be saved
[6:00] but we know everybody won't be saved
[6:04] and when he could say you know Jacob
[6:06] have I loved and Esau have I hated even
[6:09] before they were ever born
[6:11] it's got to be dependent upon some
[6:14] reason for saying it that away
[6:17] and we know that God then can look down
[6:19] through time and see everything
[6:22] and that way he could set a destiny
[6:27] and and that Destiny would be a time on
[6:30] Earth remember what foreknowledge is
[6:32] foreknowledge is knowledge before
[6:36] of an event to transpire amen you know
[6:39] some were
[6:41] basically what we would call on Earth
[6:44] all right then predestination is not a
[6:46] bad word
[6:48] because it's not like we were taught
[6:50] back in the ages and the times of of the
[6:53] calvinistics and then over into the
[6:54] Presbyterians and into the Baptist
[6:58] Churches as they were bringing it out of
[7:00] of a predetermined Factor
[7:03] and they'd put it down there and they'd
[7:05] say well and you they'd say even in the
[7:08] the old primitive Baptists would say
[7:10] that there's no need of having a Revival
[7:12] he said because maybe somebody might get
[7:14] saved that God didn't want to get saved
[7:16] now that's that's no joke that was a
[7:18] Doctrine and that's why they didn't like
[7:21] the missionary baptist when they came on
[7:23] in to that form because you know there
[7:26] was no need of having missionary work if
[7:28] God was going to save him anyway
[7:31] but we found out that that's not true
[7:35] it's by foreknowledge of what you and I
[7:37] desire amen
[7:40] if we desire to be saved then God Will
[7:43] Make A Way for us to be saved correct
[7:46] so then it's based on foreknowledge of
[7:48] what we desire amen
[7:51] amen all right then that way Jacob we
[7:53] know would be the way he would be but
[7:55] Esau would be the way he would be
[7:59] and God could look down and see what
[8:01] they would do in life and if he's not
[8:03] that kind of a god what kind of a god do
[8:05] we serve
[8:07] you know that's right I mean he got a
[8:09] peanut brain like we've got that we can
[8:11] change our mind every two seconds you
[8:13] know
[8:14] now his first decision is perfect
[8:18] and he can never change his mind right
[8:23] he's not like you and I to where he
[8:24] could just say well I thought I was
[8:26] right yesterday over today I'm Different
[8:28] you know no
[8:30] what kind of a god do we serve if he's
[8:32] not that kind of a God I don't care
[8:34] anything about serving him because he's
[8:36] just like I am
[8:38] you know he just messed up his message I
[8:41] messed up if that's all he can do
[8:43] but if he could sit back and be an
[8:45] infinite the word infinite come into the
[8:47] basis of being the word that he could
[8:49] sit back and see all things before they
[8:52] would take place
[8:54] and you know then that way he could
[8:57] write it down
[9:00] he could make the The Book of Life
[9:03] before the foundation of the world
[9:04] learns Revelations 13 8 I think it is
[9:08] he could do all those things back there
[9:10] because
[9:13] he was infinite
[9:15] all right see then we saw that
[9:19] and I told you I don't want to be a part
[9:23] of just the thoughts of God because he
[9:25] thought of everybody
[9:28] he thought of Judas his Garrett just as
[9:30] much as he'd think of you and I Amen in
[9:32] his thoughts because that way he would
[9:35] see you know what would transpire
[9:37] coming down through time all right then
[9:40] I've tried my best to tell you for about
[9:42] 40 years now I want to be a part of the
[9:45] Thinker himself
[9:47] I want the the life of God to be
[9:50] dwelling in me amen
[9:53] amen and I believe we must receive that
[9:54] as what we call the new birth
[9:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came
[9:59] on a day of Pentecost into the church
[10:02] and I believe it comes into every
[10:04] believer as the new birth to bring us
[10:07] eternal life
[10:08] all right then in bringing that eternal
[10:11] life which is God's own life
[10:13] there's not no two or three forms
[10:15] of eternal life there's only one form
[10:18] and that's the word Zoe which means
[10:20] God's own life
[10:22] all right
[10:23] and see that way that's why we don't
[10:24] believe hell to be eternal
[10:27] right because it had a beginning the
[10:29] Bible says it'll have an end one day
[10:31] death and hell will be cast into the
[10:32] Lake of Fire to be destroyed so it
[10:35] doesn't have a beginning I mean it had a
[10:36] beginning so it cannot be eternal
[10:39] anything that has a beginning
[10:41] as we use the terminologies of beginning
[10:45] it means it started somewhere
[10:48] all right
[10:49] and as it's doing it then see you would
[10:51] have to have God's own life if you lived
[10:54] eternally in hell
[10:55] God's life's not going to be in hell
[10:58] he just went there for you and I but he
[11:01] came back out right
[11:02] there was no way hell could keep him
[11:04] remember he descended to the spirits in
[11:06] prison they were disobedient in the long
[11:08] suffering of days of Noah he preached to
[11:11] them he came back up picked up the Old
[11:13] Testament Saints all right
[11:16] see then believing it that away
[11:19] we could look at it and see that God
[11:22] could look down and see he knew exactly
[11:25] who would be at church tonight
[11:27] but he knew who wouldn't be here tonight
[11:31] and see because he knew that before the
[11:33] world
[11:33] he said well then then it's all set so I
[11:36] can't change
[11:39] all set on what
[11:43] why don't you quit breathing
[11:47] all right
[11:49] I just grab your nose in your mouth just
[11:51] quit breathing
[11:52] because of it all presets you're going
[11:54] to live anyway
[11:57] right
[11:59] no we ain't gonna do that right
[12:02] We're Not Gonna We're not gonna stop
[12:03] breathing
[12:05] we're going to keep on breathing
[12:07] well like that's the way it is in God
[12:09] see he's given us the opportunity to
[12:12] serve him here as Christians in our
[12:15] lives
[12:16] to where the others can see Christ in US
[12:22] and seeing through the revealed word
[12:25] to find out what we believe and what
[12:27] we're doing all right so then it would
[12:29] be
[12:32] put on the basis of what you and I
[12:35] desire
[12:38] if we desire it God will have it for us
[12:41] he's a wonderful God
[12:43] I love it when the prophet of God said
[12:45] one day he said in all the dirty things
[12:47] Israel done said
[12:49] the great Jehovah God came down and
[12:52] went right along with them
[12:54] you know
[12:55] ten times the Bible says they sinned
[12:58] from the coming out of of Egypt over to
[13:00] Katie's barnia and each time sure he
[13:03] would punish him for it but to bulk part
[13:06] of the Israelites was on their way to
[13:08] the promised land
[13:12] and because he was still going to keep
[13:14] his word
[13:14] he told him he'd take him in
[13:17] he did
[13:18] all right because I that's why I love
[13:20] him so much because he'll keep his word
[13:22] all right now we've got up to a point
[13:27] to where that we were talking about
[13:30] uh there in the scripture where it says
[13:33] the morning Stars sang together and the
[13:35] sons of God shouted for joy
[13:38] and we could see that that was in God's
[13:40] mind before the foundation of the world
[13:43] all right
[13:44] now being in his mind means a wonderful
[13:46] thing
[13:47] unless in his mind he's seen us doing
[13:50] wrong
[13:52] and remember his mind is is not like you
[13:55] and I
[13:56] it's an amazing thing now that they can
[13:58] actually tap into your telephone line
[14:03] you know and they can actually hear
[14:06] conversations you made a month ago
[14:11] you explain that
[14:14] how can that be but they can do it
[14:17] I know
[14:19] and see then
[14:21] knowing that away then we we know that
[14:24] those are just man's ways of doing
[14:27] things the Bible says nothing is
[14:30] withholden from man
[14:32] the imagination of man's mind is
[14:34] continually evil
[14:36] and look what he's doing
[14:38] you know you can't trust nobody no more
[14:40] right
[14:42] there's just no way
[14:44] why because it's just it's this mankind
[14:46] falling apart
[14:49] every country is trying their best to
[14:52] survive and
[14:54] and we're doing the big buddy thing
[14:56] trying to help all of them survive and
[14:58] what are we doing just losing a lot of
[15:00] people
[15:00] to do all of those things
[15:02] but yet still we want freedom don't we
[15:05] and freedom is a cost
[15:09] but now think about the last few
[15:11] comments we made
[15:13] I said where it says the morning Stars
[15:16] saying together morning stars are the
[15:18] Angels or cherubims
[15:21] and the sons of God shouted for joy
[15:24] then you know that would have to be
[15:26] somewhere down through time
[15:30] just like it says as we're quoting there
[15:32] a moment ago Revelation 13 8 said these
[15:35] students are lamb slain
[15:37] before the foundation of the world all
[15:39] right you know what that meant
[15:42] if God saw that in his mind it meant
[15:45] that Jesus Christ would have to die on a
[15:49] cross
[15:49] there was no way to bypass it
[15:53] was no way to stop it
[15:55] why because God already saw it
[15:59] he said well if mankind had just
[16:01] believed him well he done so they
[16:03] wouldn't believe him
[16:05] there's any problem with that if he's
[16:06] infinite all right
[16:09] we'll see then
[16:11] it would have to be a point somewhere
[16:15] you and I would be shouting in our
[16:17] Salvation that was the point of trying
[16:19] to get across to you that we ought to be
[16:22] the most shoutness people that there is
[16:23] in the world
[16:25] and shouting people to me doesn't mean
[16:27] you have to be running owls and
[16:28] screaming and hollering
[16:30] shouting to me as a is a joy within your
[16:34] heart
[16:36] happiness about right the Salvation you
[16:39] have been given
[16:42] and then to know of what he's done for
[16:45] you and me
[16:46] he paid the price
[16:48] but you and I could be saved all right
[16:50] now
[16:53] and then we come on over into the last
[16:55] message and we were talking about
[16:57] that God knew
[16:59] that we were going to fall
[17:02] by his infinite wisdom
[17:06] and then he knew
[17:08] by us falling
[17:11] that he would have to come into being
[17:15] and dwell upon Earth
[17:18] and through the body of Jesus Christ
[17:21] almighty God himself
[17:24] stepped down in that body
[17:27] and lived upon Earth amen
[17:30] amen he told the Fire season thing he
[17:32] said unless you believe that I am he
[17:34] you'll die in your sins
[17:37] you know what they didn't believe him
[17:39] you know what they died in their sins
[17:43] but he told him
[17:45] he said if you've seen me
[17:47] you've seen the father
[17:50] but they couldn't accept that
[17:53] why because remember what we had in the
[17:56] that we've dealt with a few times the
[17:58] ego of mankind
[18:01] won't allow mankind to believe
[18:03] what another person says
[18:06] right that's right
[18:08] hardest thing in the world to get one
[18:10] person believe another one
[18:12] right
[18:15] I mean it used to be
[18:18] if we come up with a deal in the old
[18:20] days
[18:22] you know
[18:23] we just shake hands that was it
[18:28] you can't do that today
[18:33] the best thing to do if you're going
[18:35] into business is I don't care if your
[18:37] brothers or sisters or husband and wife
[18:41] the best thing to do is get a contract
[18:43] and sign the thing because at least you
[18:45] got something to deal with might not be
[18:48] worth a whole lot but it's that's what
[18:50] we've come to
[18:52] we used to we didn't lock our doors
[18:55] all we had I remember was just a string
[18:58] to pull and the little latch went up and
[19:00] he went on out he wanted to come in you
[19:02] just pulled a string
[19:04] most of the time the door is left open
[19:07] because it didn't make no difference in
[19:08] on a window no screens on the windows it
[19:12] didn't matter where you close the doors
[19:13] or not
[19:15] but you see we're living in a different
[19:17] time
[19:19] so nowadays you have to put things in a
[19:21] different way
[19:23] but see God is the same
[19:26] if he saved one man
[19:28] by the blood he has to save Everybody by
[19:31] the blood
[19:32] he doesn't make a way to say you and I
[19:34] just because how smart we are
[19:36] it's through the blood of Jesus Christ
[19:38] so that meant God had to come down
[19:40] himself
[19:42] and dwell in human flesh the Bible said
[19:45] in him dwelt the fullness whether
[19:47] godhead bodily all right he was almighty
[19:50] God
[19:52] dwelling on the Earth are the biggest
[19:54] fate that's ever been amen
[19:58] amen see and that's what we believe we
[19:59] believe that part because our dependence
[20:01] is upon him and what he says
[20:04] all right
[20:06] see then think about it what was the
[20:08] last thoughts we had
[20:13] when you think about a creation
[20:17] and creator
[20:22] remember
[20:24] God didn't create eggs and let them
[20:26] hatch
[20:27] the old argument which come first the
[20:29] chicken or the egg that's stupidity
[20:32] he said well he could have laid the eggs
[20:33] out there well why do that when he could
[20:35] create a chicken
[20:39] he only got one egg
[20:41] you got a chicken you had a whole lot of
[20:43] eggs
[20:44] right
[20:46] Lobby Grace has got two little ducks and
[20:49] they found out one of them was a male
[20:50] and one of them's a female
[20:53] well they thought they were going to
[20:54] have them about 10 or 12 because they
[20:56] asked me how many eggs did it take for a
[20:59] set and I said well it's somewhere
[21:00] around 12 13. you know maybe a little
[21:02] more very
[21:04] that okay I've done late about 20
[21:06] something eggs and ain't none of them
[21:08] hatched yet
[21:11] well if you had all that that still
[21:12] wouldn't be worth nothing
[21:14] but why not have that good old hen there
[21:16] you know so when God creates anything he
[21:19] doesn't create it in a baby form
[21:24] when he created the world it was perfect
[21:28] when he created the animals it was
[21:30] perfect it created the moon the stars
[21:33] the thing everything was perfect and in
[21:35] order
[21:36] still running today just like it was
[21:39] set your clock on it I can go back and
[21:42] tell you exactly where this world was
[21:44] setting a thousand years ago
[21:46] you know in what rotation where exactly
[21:49] of a time of day
[21:52] one because it's running so perfect
[21:55] but he could do all of that
[21:59] and then we think that he couldn't know
[22:01] all about our doings in our life
[22:04] right but yet we've got to get it down
[22:06] to evasive of believing it
[22:08] within the life we were talking about
[22:10] how God created
[22:12] his first creation is full grown amen
[22:15] amen all right
[22:17] now I know he was born as a baby come
[22:19] into life come through but you know what
[22:21] he came to full grown
[22:23] so it has to be a full grown thing
[22:25] that's why we read during the in Genesis
[22:28] I mean in Revelation where it says he's
[22:30] the beginning of the creation of God
[22:33] now that word creation there is not the
[22:35] same word or the beginning words you'd
[22:38] say in the beginning
[22:41] that's not the same word to say you know
[22:44] the beginning of the creation because it
[22:46] looked like something started
[22:48] don't just think about that it's not
[22:50] something started
[22:51] if something was brought into view that
[22:53] we could understand
[22:58] because see he if he was the beginning
[23:01] of the creation of God that would look
[23:02] like he started something
[23:07] but why not go back to where it says in
[23:09] John 1.
[23:11] in the beginning
[23:13] was the word
[23:15] the word was with God and the Word was
[23:16] God
[23:21] that's not a beginning like the word we
[23:23] think of
[23:24] oh start of something
[23:27] it just means it's something coming
[23:29] forth into from what was originally
[23:32] invisible
[23:35] no way to comprehend it
[23:39] because God never had a beginning we're
[23:41] going to read some quotes that sounds
[23:43] odd but then we're going to talk about
[23:45] them a little
[23:47] God never had a beginning
[23:50] he was eternal amen amen now the body of
[23:54] Jesus Christ
[23:55] it had a beginning that's Hebrews 10 5 a
[23:58] body thou has prepared me
[24:01] but in that body was the soul and the
[24:03] spirit of almighty God
[24:06] that's why it called in the fullness of
[24:07] the godhead bodily
[24:09] that's why we believe in one true and
[24:10] living God but yet we don't believe in
[24:12] Oneness
[24:14] because Oneness is like your finger and
[24:16] it just stops it doesn't go
[24:18] yeah
[24:19] Trinity goes over the other way he's got
[24:21] our Father Son and Holy Ghost when it
[24:24] takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make
[24:25] one God
[24:28] your father you're a human you're a
[24:30] child I mean a son or a daughter but how
[24:32] many people are they of you
[24:35] there's only one
[24:37] that's why the Bible says even the
[24:39] Eternal godhead
[24:40] can be understood by the things that we
[24:42] see
[24:44] if we just think sensible
[24:46] but to try to get our big educational
[24:48] wording but watch even with the
[24:50] educational wording
[24:52] I love to read it because
[24:56] they can keep things pretty straight
[24:58] all right
[25:00] what you see then I asked a question
[25:02] years ago
[25:07] I said when would be the first time you
[25:08] would talk about son of God
[25:12] well basically everybody was saying when
[25:14] he came on Earth you know some 2000
[25:16] years ago
[25:18] I told you I said but the scholars no
[25:23] that that one that created all things in
[25:26] the beginning that said let there be
[25:29] that that was called a son of God
[25:36] and just like I've told you many times
[25:38] to try to emphasize
[25:40] when
[25:42] Nebuchadnezzar throw those three Hebrew
[25:44] children in that fiery furnace
[25:48] the next day he looked down in there and
[25:49] he said didn't we throw three in
[25:52] we said this four down there now
[25:56] and said that fourth one is like the son
[25:58] of God
[26:02] that King had a great understanding
[26:05] because he knew that if
[26:08] he knew ever who that fourth one was
[26:11] was keeping the other you know Shadrach
[26:13] Meshach and Abednego
[26:15] given them from being destroyed
[26:18] and he knew if that would be right it
[26:20] would have to be God because the only
[26:22] one it could do because remember they
[26:23] heated it seven times it said hotter
[26:25] than it ever been before and it even
[26:27] killed the people that throw them in
[26:31] so he said that must be the son of God
[26:35] he knew that it would have to be
[26:37] almighty God to protect them
[26:40] but he also knew that if he could see
[26:43] some form
[26:46] that he would be dealing with the
[26:48] Eternal God
[26:50] he'd be dealing with what form he was
[26:52] showing himself in
[26:55] right
[26:58] see then that way we can look at it and
[27:00] see that
[27:03] God has done a marvelous thing to open
[27:06] her eyes for us to be able to follow the
[27:09] word
[27:10] and to see the truth of understanding of
[27:12] one true and living God
[27:14] he said but I've been taught all my life
[27:16] it was God the Father God the son God
[27:18] the Holy Ghost I want one scripture for
[27:19] that
[27:23] I want one scripture
[27:26] I'll give you ten thousand dollars if
[27:28] you want that much
[27:30] if you bring me a scripture that says
[27:31] God the Father God the son and God the
[27:34] Holy Ghost
[27:36] see you can't produce it
[27:38] so you go back to to your thinking
[27:41] well you just lost to ten thousand
[27:43] dollars because I ain't gonna give you
[27:44] that if you're thinking
[27:47] because I don't care about your thinking
[27:48] I don't care about my thinking it's what
[27:50] God's word says
[27:53] but that's just how sure
[27:56] when you know what you're talking about
[27:57] you can stand there and say with her and
[27:58] he is
[28:02] right see in that then you have to
[28:04] understand one God to be able to follow
[28:06] throughout the Bible
[28:10] because you know the Bible you know what
[28:12] it is
[28:13] it's a written
[28:15] words to mankind
[28:18] to express to mankind by the writers of
[28:21] the word
[28:22] what that God meant to each one of them
[28:27] right and it was compiled together and
[28:29] brought into our form
[28:35] see then
[28:38] when we go back now to think about
[28:39] something
[28:44] God had never had a beginning
[28:48] it could never have an ending
[28:54] but there was a time that he wasn't
[28:57] called God because that's our English
[28:59] word
[29:03] in the scholars you can take your
[29:05] Scofield bible and read it
[29:07] the word is Elohim
[29:09] Elohim Elohim is the way you want to
[29:12] pronounce it just in case
[29:15] but it means self-existing amen
[29:19] amen so then there was a time God
[29:21] existed alone
[29:24] he was self-existing
[29:27] well he never had a beginning
[29:33] but then as he began to
[29:36] what's a better way of saying it
[29:38] condescend
[29:40] to were human beings could comprehend
[29:43] him
[29:46] so as he would begin to condescend
[29:48] downward to you and I
[29:52] he would begin to unveil himself
[29:55] to allow himself to be comprehended by
[29:58] mankind
[30:02] now
[30:04] why did they kill Jesus
[30:09] they said
[30:11] you're a man
[30:13] making yourself God
[30:16] I mean that's scripture right
[30:19] when it was really god making himself a
[30:21] man
[30:23] God had created a body
[30:25] Emmanuel
[30:28] God With Us
[30:31] and in doing that then
[30:34] we can see that he wants to reveal
[30:37] himself
[30:40] if we are as Paul said in Acts there to
[30:44] them on Mars Hill he said to that
[30:46] unknown God you have a little
[30:47] inscription there just in case you know
[30:50] they had forgotten one maybe he left
[30:51] them out they had God's all over the
[30:53] place but they had a little place left
[30:55] or something in it
[30:56] they said to the unknown God
[30:59] just in case they missed one of them you
[31:02] know big toes hands eyes whatever
[31:04] animals cats dogs they had all kind of
[31:07] Gods
[31:08] in India alone they got over three
[31:10] million gods and goddesses
[31:14] that's three million doctrines
[31:19] but think about it Paul said I want to
[31:22] talk to you about that gun the one
[31:24] you're said the unknown God
[31:26] and he said you've said it before
[31:28] yourselves he said you said that we are
[31:31] his offspring
[31:33] and said that's exactly what we are
[31:36] we are the children of God
[31:41] even Mankind in his lost estate
[31:45] look what he's done in science
[31:50] look what he's wound up and doing
[31:54] like right around him said he said the
[31:56] Bible said in the last days men's heart
[31:58] would fail for fear
[32:01] now specifically in this day heart
[32:03] attacks
[32:04] you know by pieces
[32:06] all kind of things right
[32:10] and he said you know God knew that we'd
[32:13] need it
[32:15] he said he had them to come up with the
[32:17] ability
[32:18] to make a little old bitty pill
[32:22] what is it natural glycerin
[32:25] and you just put one under your tongue
[32:30] see he knew we'd need that
[32:32] that's how great of a God he is
[32:35] you know what that only affects that
[32:38] certain valve or whatever it is in your
[32:40] heart
[32:41] it's nothing else for anything else it
[32:43] goes to that one spot to open it up
[32:46] because he knew we'd need it
[32:48] thank God for doctors good ones
[32:51] quacks I don't care for them I don't
[32:53] care for quack preachers either
[32:55] I have more against quack preachers than
[32:57] I have against quack Gods I mean doctors
[33:01] I can put up with doctors I just walk
[33:03] away
[33:04] I told one one day I said but you
[33:06] believe that God healed my blood
[33:08] pressure
[33:09] I said I got the proof he's laying in
[33:11] front of you
[33:12] that they run at Dart General Motors for
[33:14] quite a few weeks my blood pressure was
[33:16] like 180 over 110.
[33:20] and I said we prayed at the church and
[33:21] got him and you believe it he said nope
[33:23] I got to walk out until my wife was
[33:25] called another doctor I ain't going to
[33:26] him
[33:28] why he's an unbeliever
[33:33] you go fool with an unbeliever
[33:35] in the world
[33:37] but he ain't got no common sense either
[33:41] he can't understand me when I tell him I
[33:42] said doc my wife gets on to him and I go
[33:44] and they say how you doing I said I'm
[33:45] doing wonderful
[33:49] I said what do you think I'm supposed to
[33:50] be 73 years old
[33:54] she said well what are you going to the
[33:56] doctor for so you don't want to go in
[33:57] now I'm going outside okay hey Doc how
[33:59] you doing he's down I said I'm doing
[34:00] wonderful that's got one problem
[34:03] I got a caulk something into my throat
[34:05] that's messed me up give me something
[34:06] for that
[34:08] but other than that I'm doing wonderful
[34:11] when they told me that I had leukemia I
[34:13] just life and said so what
[34:17] supposed to be the kind you don't die of
[34:18] but you die with
[34:21] I'm going to internet doctor he said I
[34:23] said do what you want to do I ain't
[34:26] going to take you chemo
[34:28] I ain't got nothing against anybody else
[34:29] taking it I said you're on that side of
[34:31] it I'm on this side of it you know what
[34:33] it does and I know what it does but I
[34:35] said go ahead
[34:36] I go in there now and he says how you
[34:38] doing I said I'm doing wonderful
[34:40] this guy sees cancer patients all day
[34:42] long
[34:44] chemo treatments all day long
[34:47] he said I'd love for you to come in
[34:49] we just sit down live talk
[34:53] he'd want to listen around on me the
[34:55] other day and I told you about it he was
[34:58] thumping around on my stomach you know
[35:00] I said what are you doing
[35:03] kind of man he's a doctor he you know
[35:05] he's a specialist well he's a human
[35:07] being I said what are you doing
[35:09] he said well I'm checking your spleen to
[35:11] see if it's all right
[35:13] I said Oh I thought she's just stopping
[35:14] me to make us think you know that you
[35:16] knew what she was doing
[35:18] he just alive
[35:21] that's the way I talked to the dog why
[35:22] because they're they're human beings
[35:26] they're not all healer
[35:28] when that doctor cut that bland off and
[35:30] they found it that started with leukemia
[35:32] Florida in there in the body they just
[35:35] told me way before then at my house
[35:36] white blood count was Rising but when
[35:39] they took a gland off the doctor he said
[35:41] can I pray for you
[35:43] I said I sure hope you do yeah yeah he
[35:45] said no I mean we don't pray he said I
[35:47] want to pray right now I said Woo I want
[35:50] you to pray that's the kind of doctors I
[35:52] like and we love doctors we love dog we
[35:54] do everything yet God is the Healer
[35:59] I told him I said doc you can cut all
[36:01] you want to but you can't put it back
[36:02] together
[36:04] it takes God to grow that thing back
[36:06] together
[36:08] cut you wide open there and spread you
[36:10] out like that and work on your heart put
[36:12] you all back together it all grows back
[36:15] yeah okay listen
[36:19] I'm trying to get you to see that we
[36:21] love God is the main thing
[36:23] God is the Healer
[36:26] all right mankind he can do anything he
[36:29] can
[36:30] and they can do amazing things today
[36:34] almost to
[36:37] it's almost to an infinite stage
[36:40] you know
[36:42] if they could just
[36:44] send messages around the world
[36:47] right now this service tonight is
[36:48] overseas
[36:51] that's just something isn't it
[36:53] when he used to you you had to holler to
[36:55] the next door neighbor
[36:58] that's not a way you could get it
[37:00] we kids used to take a string you know
[37:02] and put have you ever done that put a
[37:03] tin can of string and hold it and then
[37:05] to talk into the tin can you know and
[37:07] the other guy on the other end all
[37:08] around hey can you hear me
[37:10] well sure could hear me hear me without
[37:11] the tin can
[37:14] but now my goodness they just do
[37:16] anything they want to because
[37:20] they have broken into God's Laboratory
[37:23] to be able to see and he's allowed these
[37:24] things to happen
[37:26] but I'm trying to get you to see that we
[37:27] believe in an eternal infinite God all
[37:31] wisdom all-knowing all things
[37:33] then that way we know he can
[37:34] predestinate by his foreknowledge
[37:37] and that way he doesn't have to worry
[37:39] about all of the things
[37:41] but now let's get to the point
[37:45] and I said God always begins everything
[37:47] in a
[37:49] a full-grown form
[37:52] even when the Holy Ghost fell on a day
[37:53] of Pentecost
[37:56] it fell on those had been tutored for
[37:58] three and a half years
[38:02] agree right
[38:04] they've been told her they had to live
[38:06] with the Lord Jesus for three and a half
[38:07] years and then the Holy Ghost fail
[38:09] and it put them to where you're looking
[38:11] at the pyramid where it says holy spirit
[38:13] and we know the love of God hadn't come
[38:15] down in The Headstone that was to come
[38:17] in the end time that's according to the
[38:18] scripture amen
[38:19] all right
[38:22] but yet it was a full-grown Church to
[38:25] start off
[38:27] because he doesn't start off anything he
[38:29] never used a novice to write the Bible
[38:33] right he used members of those who were
[38:36] there in the beginning
[38:37] or either like Paul who had received
[38:39] that understanding
[38:42] and God had led him out into the deserts
[38:44] and and opened his eyes to the word
[38:48] see then in that he begins everything
[38:52] in the point that
[38:54] is full grown so then it's something
[38:57] that's full grown now here's the whole
[38:58] here's the whole thing I'm trying to
[39:00] prove and show all right
[39:03] if he begins it in full grown form Adam
[39:06] wasn't a baby
[39:07] and then growed up
[39:09] he's a full-grown man
[39:14] then Eve was taken from Adam full grown
[39:17] not a baby
[39:19] but if you don't get anything out of the
[39:21] message at all get one thing
[39:24] God begins everything in a full-grown
[39:26] form
[39:28] because that's his pattern that's what
[39:31] is supposed to be by everybody
[39:33] Adam was as I said there Sunday Adam was
[39:35] God's pattern
[39:39] God wants every child to be like Adam
[39:42] had control of the animals who lived
[39:44] there in the garden everything was
[39:46] beautiful
[39:47] until sin entered the picture
[39:50] all right
[39:51] then
[39:54] thinking about beginning in a full grown
[39:56] then there's no beginning of a full
[39:58] grown
[40:00] yeah I'm trying to lay down something
[40:02] because when you read there where it
[40:04] says the beginning of the creation of
[40:06] God
[40:11] hunt the prophet of God said that makes
[40:12] most people think
[40:14] that God created Jesus and Jesus created
[40:17] everything else
[40:19] because see it's the beginning of a
[40:21] creation
[40:22] the Bible says all things were made by
[40:24] him Hebrews 1 John 1.
[40:27] James like three and six or six and
[40:30] three where he says Jesus Christ created
[40:32] all things
[40:34] Jesus the flesh man never he wasn't back
[40:36] there
[40:37] right but it was the Christ amen
[40:40] the Christ was the Creator God
[40:44] but and he had a beginning but now not a
[40:46] beginning like
[40:48] something that started
[40:52] that's the purpose of me trying to prove
[40:54] that he begins it with full grown
[40:58] see if we we hold a word beginning we
[41:01] would have it as a baby
[41:04] right
[41:06] come on are are you you're following my
[41:08] point
[41:10] you would have to put it a baby and let
[41:11] it grow up because you'd be starting
[41:13] from a beginning
[41:16] but if you can start something from full
[41:18] grown
[41:22] then you're getting away from a thoughts
[41:24] of an idea of a beginning
[41:28] now you're getting to where it says
[41:30] there in John 1 as we were quoting in
[41:32] the beginning
[41:33] was the word
[41:35] the word was with God and the Word was
[41:37] God
[41:38] now you're going back to the eternal
[41:41] to see how the Eternal come into being
[41:45] because remember him being Eternal there
[41:48] was no way we could comprehend him right
[41:50] the Bible says the only begotten of the
[41:52] father hath declared him
[41:57] amen Jesus Christ was the only begotten
[41:58] Adam was created
[42:02] but Jesus was begotten amen
[42:05] amen the body had a beginning
[42:09] but the n-word part of that man soul in
[42:11] spirit had no beginning
[42:14] you can't have an ending
[42:16] all right
[42:18] so then when we talk about in the
[42:19] beginning of the creation
[42:21] and I try to get into the message in a
[42:23] minute we have time and don't think
[42:25] about something that started
[42:30] that's my whole point if you're going to
[42:31] start something you got to start it as a
[42:34] baby
[42:37] that's sensible isn't it
[42:40] none of us got here full grown
[42:43] I don't think we did
[42:45] if you did you beat the rest of us
[42:48] Mom and Daddy got us here and we had a
[42:50] beginning
[42:55] but what about this eternal God that
[42:57] we're talking about
[43:00] who never had a beginning
[43:02] you read of him over in Hebrews
[43:05] about five six seven right through there
[43:07] especially seven
[43:10] where he's talking about Melchizedek
[43:13] and said it had no beginning of days
[43:16] and no ending in life
[43:19] well yet he met he met Abraham
[43:22] and Abraham
[43:25] very
[43:26] archive
[43:28] go back and read your Bible
[43:31] he was able to sit down and eat and
[43:33] everything else
[43:34] but yet Abraham said
[43:36] that he was Lord God
[43:40] made manifest in the flesh
[43:44] that inside had no beginning that flesh
[43:47] he just created it stepped into it and
[43:49] came down
[43:50] all he had to do was speak it right back
[43:52] out and go
[43:53] but see Melchizedek
[43:55] in that way could never die for you and
[43:58] I
[44:00] so God's plan and purpose could never be
[44:03] fulfilled
[44:06] because his plan and purpose was to be a
[44:08] father
[44:10] right
[44:12] to be a savior
[44:13] to be a Healer
[44:15] to be a redeemer
[44:17] he said well how do you know that so
[44:19] sure because I've experienced it amen
[44:21] haven't you
[44:24] haven't you received him as your savior
[44:27] don't you know him as your father
[44:34] and surely you've seen him in healing
[44:37] if you hadn't just look around somebody
[44:39] else has maybe you can look at
[44:43] but you know what I think about that a
[44:44] lot you just think of all the things who
[44:47] was it uh
[44:48] Stonewall Jackson
[44:50] is that the one he said I never take a
[44:52] drink of water
[44:53] without thanking God for it
[44:57] now he was a man right
[45:00] he put all his dependence upon God
[45:05] and you see if we could believe it that
[45:06] way you better sanctify everything you
[45:09] eat drink
[45:13] sister up in Virginia up there
[45:16] just walked by a place one day and some
[45:18] smoke came up they never didn't know
[45:19] what it was
[45:20] I don't know where she's still living or
[45:22] not but I know for many many say 20
[45:24] years or more than that
[45:26] her lungs and everything was just
[45:29] gone why because there's something she
[45:33] through the air
[45:35] we better thank God every day
[45:39] I trust my wife I love her but she don't
[45:42] know what's in that food she's preparing
[45:43] for me
[45:47] I don't worry about her putting no uh uh
[45:50] arsenic or stuff into it
[45:54] I don't worry about that
[45:58] there's come on folks you got people
[46:00] sitting here that knows the truth every
[46:02] chicken you've ever ate got salmonella
[46:04] in it
[46:05] ever to your chicken's got salmonella
[46:08] not just a few
[46:10] everyone is alive and you eat it eat it
[46:14] it's got salmonella
[46:16] let's go you're gonna quit eating
[46:17] chicken huh
[46:19] I love it
[46:23] but you see church that's why you need
[46:25] to pray over it
[46:26] that's why I've told you inside our
[46:29] medicine cabinet you open the door and
[46:31] right there sticking on that right where
[46:33] all the medicine is at my time you know
[46:35] I stick in there a prayer cloth
[46:37] can right there
[46:39] why ask God to sanctify that medicine
[46:42] sometime and see if it don't change the
[46:44] effects to you
[46:47] why not
[46:49] there's death and all of that
[46:51] amen
[46:53] what do you understanding me now
[46:56] so God begins everything in a full grown
[46:58] form
[47:00] all right
[47:03] we may call it a son
[47:06] that's no problem we're Sons and
[47:09] Daughters of a living God right
[47:11] but the Son and Daughter of a living God
[47:13] mean we're a little bit of kids and well
[47:15] in God we are you have a question you
[47:17] know ain't none of us bigger for nothing
[47:19] we ain't big enough to put on our own
[47:21] shoes let alone I spiritually speak it
[47:24] Einstein couldn't even tell he is he's
[47:26] so smart
[47:27] but we're so dumb
[47:30] quit listen Church
[47:32] when he begun that church on the day of
[47:34] Pentecost
[47:35] he had tutored them for three and a half
[47:37] years
[47:38] and then the Holy Ghost fell
[47:43] right don't you think it would be great
[47:44] today to get back to the book of Acts
[47:47] where they said Silver and Gold Have I
[47:49] None but in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:50] rise up and walk
[47:53] you think I'm long-winded Paul preached
[47:55] All Night One Night
[47:57] right
[47:58] Feller fell out of window
[48:00] broke his neck
[48:02] right because of Paul's long-winded
[48:05] preacher
[48:06] Well we'd say well what they want Paul
[48:09] you ain't gonna preach that way tomorrow
[48:10] night or he's in all let's preach all
[48:12] night and all day you know why because
[48:13] Paul went down to lady's body up on that
[48:16] boy and the boy was raised back to life
[48:18] he just got up and went on about eating
[48:19] breakfast
[48:23] bad God moving among the church that are
[48:25] in the book of Acts
[48:27] and I long to see that don't you
[48:30] I believe we have signs and wonders
[48:31] among us we've seen the dead Rays we've
[48:34] seen that sick of yield
[48:38] we don't have to talk about it we've
[48:39] seen it
[48:40] it's not bragging
[48:42] the facts are there
[48:45] all right
[48:47] we've seen God bring rain we've seen him
[48:49] take away rain we've seen him do
[48:51] I've seen everything in the world but
[48:53] blinded eyes opened
[48:55] I'm still praying about that
[48:59] but listen Church
[49:03] when he begins something he begins it in
[49:05] a full-grown form so it's not the word
[49:08] beginning
[49:09] when it says the beginning of the
[49:11] creation of God
[49:13] it's stipulating who that is
[49:16] you know whatever the word would be used
[49:17] I don't have the education
[49:19] but he's designating who this is
[49:24] and he he never done it until this age
[49:28] he didn't write of it in any other age
[49:31] but in his age
[49:34] because this is the age of when science
[49:36] would come to Great understanding as
[49:38] we've been talking about
[49:40] right but the only reason they come to
[49:41] Greater understanding is to because God
[49:43] has opened his word
[49:46] if they just had any sense at all the
[49:49] word of God says that there's a day
[49:51] missing in space time
[49:54] and the only way they could ever find it
[49:56] was go back to the Bible and read it
[49:57] right
[49:59] all the scientific equipment they had
[50:01] they couldn't figure it out because they
[50:03] had a day missing
[50:05] if they'd just read the Bible because
[50:06] they finally said well is anybody around
[50:08] here got any hopes whatsoever about this
[50:10] 24 hours that we're missing
[50:13] and God said well in the Bible
[50:15] it speaks of a Time
[50:18] they got their Bible and read it
[50:20] but when they run their calculation
[50:22] systems back to that day
[50:24] and don't you think they can't do it
[50:25] that's what I said they can show you
[50:27] right where this world was at 2 000
[50:29] years ago
[50:32] because they had to do that to get all
[50:34] the spaceships and things out into orbit
[50:36] because they'd run into each other
[50:40] so they went back and they said well
[50:41] couldn't you find it the man read it to
[50:43] him in the Bible and they said you have
[50:45] to do something wrong
[50:47] because we got about a 20-minute span
[50:49] that we're missing
[50:54] the man says well I do remember another
[50:55] time
[50:58] and then when they read the scripture
[50:59] carefully
[51:01] it doesn't say there when it was
[51:02] speaking of the son standing still you
[51:04] remember Joshua and the son standing
[51:05] still it doesn't say a day it says about
[51:07] a day
[51:09] read your Bible it says about a day and
[51:11] they could prove it was like 20 minutes
[51:12] missing they said was any other thing in
[51:15] there that you could figure out to help
[51:17] us with this he said well there was a
[51:19] time when a man was going to die
[51:23] you remember there in one of the Kings I
[51:25] think and they figured out man this man
[51:27] was going to die until he asked God
[51:29] and he asked him for a sign
[51:34] he said it would be easy for it to go
[51:35] forward but said let it run backwards
[51:39] he ran back so many
[51:42] ever what they were calculating from at
[51:44] that time how much he did
[51:46] you know it went degrees and you know
[51:48] what it wound up being the other 20
[51:49] minutes they needed
[51:51] if they just read the Bible
[51:53] they could approved right where
[51:54] everything was at from the Bible
[51:57] all right
[51:58] but see God didn't send us a Bible that
[52:00] was written by babies
[52:03] the Bible is the word of God it's
[52:05] written by God himself appearing to
[52:06] mankind amen
[52:09] amen you'd have to agree
[52:11] because how could it be so perfect
[52:15] show me a contradiction in it
[52:17] I want to see it
[52:21] he said well I think don't tell me what
[52:23] you think I want to see it in the word
[52:25] don't give a hoot what you think
[52:29] but listen Church
[52:31] when he begins anything it's not a
[52:34] beginning like
[52:36] you know at one time this was a tree
[52:39] at one time that had a beginning and a
[52:41] seed
[52:42] you know
[52:45] but in God when he's talking about a
[52:47] beginning
[52:49] he's not talking about a beginning like
[52:51] a starting point because how would it be
[52:54] when he said in the beginning was the
[52:55] word
[52:59] right
[53:00] because if he took it that way see you'd
[53:02] say in the beginning a word started
[53:07] the word didn't start
[53:09] you're always there it's God it's why it
[53:12] says in the beginning was the word the
[53:14] word was with God
[53:17] we said well I when you're standing here
[53:18] that's two people but you keep on
[53:20] reading and he said and the Word was God
[53:23] read your Bible
[53:28] all right
[53:30] then anything that we talk about a
[53:32] beginning like that on the death
[53:34] Pentecost when that Holy Ghost fail that
[53:36] was the beginning
[53:38] of the Gentile dispensation of Christ to
[53:41] the church
[53:44] it just simply meant a time that it
[53:46] would come into being
[53:48] because it already prophesied throughout
[53:50] the word all the way down
[53:52] and it just finally come into being
[53:55] so think about that when we think of
[53:57] trying to get into the in the beginning
[54:01] it's not something to start
[54:04] but something that where you can begin
[54:06] to comprehend it
[54:10] right
[54:13] right you remember the story told of the
[54:14] old man when they was telling him that
[54:16] one of these days he'd heard this
[54:17] lecture and he said one of these days
[54:19] said man I'll be just flying all over
[54:21] the world
[54:23] he got up he said that's the biggest
[54:25] bunch of Hypocrites that's ever been
[54:28] so there's no way that man can fly said
[54:30] come on Harvard Wilbur let's go
[54:34] he got his two boys and went home they
[54:36] were the two guys that started the
[54:37] flying
[54:38] they just didn't listen to Daddy
[54:41] right
[54:43] man would you see Church
[54:48] God knew what he was going to do that's
[54:50] what I've been trying to get you to see
[54:55] he had a plan and a purpose
[54:59] to let himself
[55:01] come into manifestation that you and I
[55:06] would have some way of comprehending him
[55:10] we wouldn't be like a person that you
[55:13] know people said but God brother there
[55:14] God is a spirit I know the Bible what is
[55:17] that John 5 24 and John 5 24 God is a
[55:21] spirit and data where it's been much
[55:22] worse been spirit and Truth all right if
[55:24] we can worship any worship Him in spirit
[55:26] and in truth we find out what kind of a
[55:27] God he is
[55:32] see we want to read the part God is The
[55:33] Spirit Well he just floating around
[55:36] I just float around
[55:37] he said Heaven's my throne and Earth is
[55:39] my foot still
[55:41] he said what building to Moses what
[55:43] building could you be make me
[55:46] sure
[55:48] we want to design it and want to do this
[55:52] but what about when Jesus was there on
[55:53] Mount of transfiguration
[55:56] and there was Moses and Elijah talking
[55:58] to Jesus and Peter James and John saw it
[56:01] read your Bible a little
[56:03] Peter said well he was great he said
[56:05] when he's finally saw Jesus in a minute
[56:07] he saw no man but Jesus only
[56:12] he said Lord let's build three
[56:14] Tabernacles one for you one for Moses
[56:17] one for Elijah
[56:19] right
[56:21] but what did God say
[56:25] he said shut up talking about buildings
[56:27] I don't need any
[56:31] I'm the one that surprised all things
[56:34] but this is my beloved Son and whom I'm
[56:37] pleased to dwell in
[56:40] right
[56:41] not just satisfied with him but pleased
[56:43] to dwell in him
[56:45] because what he was almighty God
[56:48] or as I said while ago Jesus was the
[56:50] busy biggest fate that's ever been
[56:52] or either he was almighty God no no
[56:55] brother Dale he wouldn't he he wasn't
[56:57] almighty God he's a second person second
[56:59] person of what give me a trinity word
[57:01] out of the Bible anywhere
[57:04] I'll give you another ten thousand to
[57:06] get that one to find a trinity in the
[57:08] Bible
[57:10] I'll be broke in a little while
[57:12] if somebody produced it but they can't
[57:13] do it
[57:15] well
[57:17] great Scholars say
[57:19] nobody can understand about God we just
[57:23] got to believe believe what
[57:26] you can't believe something that you
[57:28] don't know about so what the Bible says
[57:33] I want to know the Bible said they that
[57:35] no they're God
[57:37] she'll do exploits
[57:42] see the beginning of the creation
[57:48] then what happened there
[57:54] what happened there
[57:58] that we could comprehend
[58:00] remember the purpose
[58:02] the purpose of God in the way he would
[58:04] descend
[58:05] would be able to reveal himself to
[58:07] mankind
[58:10] now come on folks if here's God think a
[58:13] little bit I know that's hypothetical
[58:15] and stupid I guess but
[58:18] if you as God wouldn't you want to be
[58:19] wouldn't you want to reveal yourself to
[58:21] your people
[58:22] wouldn't you want your people to be made
[58:23] known
[58:24] I have no secrets that I keep from my
[58:26] children
[58:30] come on I want them to know about me
[58:34] they got a key to everything at the
[58:35] house they know where everything's at
[58:41] listen Church
[58:46] we have spent all these years trying to
[58:48] make ourselves known to our children
[58:50] what do you think about a God that spent
[58:52] six thousand years making himself known
[58:55] to mankind amen
[58:58] right
[58:59] and he's revealing himself
[59:01] so there when it starts
[59:05] he said well how do you know
[59:09] there's a simple answer to that or a
[59:11] question
[59:12] how do you know I ain't right
[59:16] all right
[59:18] I'm talking to brother the other day I
[59:19] said what gets me these people to say
[59:22] brother Dale I don't agree with you on
[59:24] what you teach
[59:26] I said okay tell me the truth about it
[59:28] well I don't know the truth but I don't
[59:30] agree with you
[59:34] I've had them to openly say that
[59:36] you listen to him
[59:43] well if you can't prove me wrong
[59:45] it's about time to start believing
[59:48] right if you can prove me wrong then
[59:50] come on I'm open for understanding
[59:55] and sure won't correction because I can
[59:57] be helped
[1:00:01] but don't come and talk to me on silly
[1:00:03] things
[1:00:04] well brother Dale don't you believe that
[1:00:06] that there's a a father son and a holy
[1:00:08] ghost yes I do
[1:00:10] but not no three persons
[1:00:15] come on we've done been through all of
[1:00:17] that enough hadn't we
[1:00:18] God injury persons Blessed Trinity
[1:00:22] where's it at
[1:00:25] what is the Trinity Doctrine
[1:00:28] God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[1:00:30] co-equal and co-eternal
[1:00:33] that the doctor
[1:00:35] father son the Holy Ghost now how can
[1:00:37] the son be co-equal
[1:00:40] how can it be Eternal if he's a son
[1:00:48] that's open right that's just as much as
[1:00:50] I can say
[1:00:54] a lot of you got children uh any kids
[1:00:58] ever got as old as you are yet
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:07] and even if he died they can't get as
[1:01:08] old as you are because in a wrong time
[1:01:10] frame part of it
[1:01:12] sensible
[1:01:14] just talk about it that's where I love
[1:01:17] to talk about God because that's what I
[1:01:18] do that's the way I see him
[1:01:20] I see him in everything that I look at
[1:01:23] you know
[1:01:25] see another way I don't have to go
[1:01:27] around try to find him
[1:01:29] he said I'll be with you hallway
[1:01:32] he didn't say always
[1:01:34] because always would mean he is right
[1:01:36] now sometimes he gets to leave me why
[1:01:38] because I get into trouble
[1:01:41] I do things that are not right and he
[1:01:42] pulls away from me
[1:01:44] he gives me a little strike and he said
[1:01:46] light up boy
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:50] what do you see what I'm trying to get
[1:01:52] you to to the point
[1:01:55] when you say a son of God
[1:02:02] what do you mean a son of God
[1:02:08] see Jesus was called a son of God
[1:02:10] but he wouldn't call God the son that's
[1:02:12] saying I want to go now
[1:02:14] he wouldn't call that he was called a
[1:02:16] son of God
[1:02:18] all right
[1:02:19] Nebuchadnezzar looked down in there and
[1:02:21] said like a son of God
[1:02:25] Peter one day he said Thou Art the
[1:02:27] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:02:36] what did I say it a moment ago why did
[1:02:38] they kill Jesus
[1:02:41] they believed they were Sons and
[1:02:43] Daughters of God
[1:02:44] come on those Pharisees and Sadducees no
[1:02:47] matter how sad you want to get on the
[1:02:49] Sadducees
[1:02:50] he still believes that he was a child of
[1:02:52] God
[1:02:53] he believed he was the son of God
[1:02:57] they show you the sign of circumcision
[1:02:59] to prove it
[1:03:01] showing that their lineage coming from
[1:03:03] Abraham
[1:03:07] they believed in the son of God
[1:03:11] and they knew that Jesus was not saying
[1:03:13] the way they were saying that they were
[1:03:15] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:18] the way he said it he said unless you
[1:03:20] believe that I am he
[1:03:22] you will die in your sins that was not
[1:03:24] just saying I am a son
[1:03:28] they said you're a man making yourself
[1:03:30] God
[1:03:34] they knew that what he was saying was
[1:03:36] that he was the Messiah
[1:03:37] and you know the Jews today are looking
[1:03:39] for the Messiah to come
[1:03:41] right right
[1:03:43] and they believed the Messiah
[1:03:46] will be a man
[1:03:49] go get your Jew and talk to him
[1:03:52] they have people every so often that
[1:03:54] they believed to be the Messiah
[1:03:58] but they're looking for the Messiah to
[1:04:00] come that's what I told it Israeli God
[1:04:03] I said you're looking for the coming of
[1:04:05] Messiah
[1:04:06] I said but we believe the messiah's
[1:04:08] already come amen and what he was he was
[1:04:11] had a rash all over him
[1:04:14] he was itchy and he said I take two or
[1:04:16] three baths every night and hot water
[1:04:17] trying my best to to be able to just
[1:04:20] exist in the days with y'all
[1:04:24] I said Reuben
[1:04:26] you're looking for the coming to Messiah
[1:04:28] he said yes I said we believe Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ was that Messiah
[1:04:34] I said he told us that we lay hands on
[1:04:36] the sick they shall recover
[1:04:38] would you mind if Brother Dean was there
[1:04:40] I said would you mind if we pray for you
[1:04:43] he said no I wish you would we prayed
[1:04:45] for her the next morning he got up he's
[1:04:46] ain't having no more trouble
[1:04:49] but you know what never converted him
[1:04:52] what
[1:04:55] see we talk a lot about Elijah to come
[1:04:58] into the last days cool times you're a
[1:05:00] Jew and ask him
[1:05:02] come on go find your Jew and ask him
[1:05:04] what's going to happen
[1:05:05] he believes Elijah is going to come
[1:05:08] first
[1:05:09] that's right the four run to Messiah
[1:05:14] go talk to your Jew and you'll find out
[1:05:16] a lot of things they believe in the
[1:05:18] coming of Elijah
[1:05:20] they believe Elijah is going to show
[1:05:21] them exactly where to build a temple
[1:05:23] right to the spot all other things
[1:05:28] well we just believe Elijah's to come to
[1:05:30] the Gentiles
[1:05:33] in the fifth time he's going to go to
[1:05:35] the Jews
[1:05:37] that's the only difference
[1:05:39] but you understand
[1:05:42] anything's got a beginning has an end to
[1:05:44] it
[1:05:49] but if God had no beginning then he'll
[1:05:51] never have an ending
[1:05:52] and we've done been through all of the
[1:05:54] points of showing you the body the human
[1:05:56] body had a beginning our bodies are not
[1:05:58] eternal
[1:06:00] right we got enough sense to look around
[1:06:01] and know that
[1:06:03] if you don't believe it come up here and
[1:06:05] I'll hit you on the big toe you'll find
[1:06:06] out you're still just a no mortal person
[1:06:11] but see Jesus was that God made manifest
[1:06:14] in flesh
[1:06:17] called the son of God
[1:06:19] that was the first time the word was
[1:06:21] used
[1:06:24] Adam was called a son of God
[1:06:28] read your Bible
[1:06:30] Son of God
[1:06:31] right
[1:06:33] he was the beginning of mankind
[1:06:36] as mortal people
[1:06:37] you agree
[1:06:39] and he didn't begin as a baby he began
[1:06:41] as a full-grown man
[1:06:48] but you see that's what we want to get
[1:06:49] into the point of thinking about
[1:06:55] the first creation would always be the
[1:06:57] example
[1:07:03] but what we're going to talk about for a
[1:07:05] minute is just just a few minutes I'll
[1:07:07] lay down the background we'll get back
[1:07:08] to this Sunday
[1:07:09] way to be preaching Sunday afternoon
[1:07:11] Lord willing
[1:07:13] we've got a fellowship meeting to go to
[1:07:14] Saturday so
[1:07:16] you ain't gonna be gone
[1:07:22] think about it
[1:07:27] the best you can do is
[1:07:30] to read about the scholars or the things
[1:07:32] and brother Branham was highly read upon
[1:07:35] those things
[1:07:36] and he used a lot of Scofield's
[1:07:38] footnotes and things and I do too as
[1:07:41] long as I can see it right
[1:07:46] and those
[1:07:47] dollars and things they say
[1:07:50] that the first form of God that could be
[1:07:52] comprehended
[1:07:53] in any way would be called the logos
[1:07:57] which means speech
[1:07:59] and that's why we were talking about
[1:08:00] holy ghost that Jesus Christ created all
[1:08:03] things Hebrews 1. John 1.
[1:08:09] it says that Jesus Christ created all
[1:08:11] things
[1:08:12] not Jesus the flesh no no no come on
[1:08:17] the Christ
[1:08:19] the Christ the logos they call it
[1:08:22] they call it another word they call it
[1:08:24] theophany
[1:08:27] the word theophany comes from the basis
[1:08:29] of being the body of a deity is the best
[1:08:31] way to define it
[1:08:34] it's a body
[1:08:37] Moses saw
[1:08:39] the back part of a man you remember that
[1:08:42] in the Bible
[1:08:43] he kept saying God I'd like to see you
[1:08:45] what about a man that talked to God face
[1:08:47] to face lip to lip near to ear
[1:08:52] come on he had right can he read your
[1:08:55] Bible
[1:08:55] it said he talked to him lift the ear
[1:09:00] Moses one day he said God I'd love to
[1:09:02] see you
[1:09:04] he said you can't see me right now
[1:09:05] because I'm not through with the doings
[1:09:09] he said I'm going to tell you what you
[1:09:10] do is you go stand in the cliff to The
[1:09:12] Rock
[1:09:13] you remember how the cliff got in the
[1:09:14] rock
[1:09:16] that's where Moses was told to go Smite
[1:09:18] to rock
[1:09:20] and the water came out for all Israel
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] not a little trickle of water two
[1:09:25] million people and all their cattle in
[1:09:27] their donkeys and horses and all of
[1:09:29] their animals and camels and things
[1:09:32] and enough water was running out of one
[1:09:34] stream there to supply every bit of it
[1:09:36] and the Bible says the water followed
[1:09:38] them so everywhere they went it was just
[1:09:40] right along with them
[1:09:42] all right you said well that's
[1:09:43] impossible well you don't believe the
[1:09:45] Bible
[1:09:48] they can prove it from the sky now
[1:09:52] they can go up in the sky and shoot back
[1:09:53] down and they can follow where that
[1:09:54] River Run
[1:09:55] come on I read a little science too
[1:10:00] I love to read things like that
[1:10:02] it shows me that the word of God is true
[1:10:06] yeah
[1:10:08] we were there riding down through on the
[1:10:10] on the Dead Sea Shores and looked out
[1:10:13] there and for
[1:10:15] half a mile across one side of the road
[1:10:18] for miles down through there was a
[1:10:20] prettiest growing fruits and vegetables
[1:10:23] and the Reuben the God he said Sam we
[1:10:25] can grow anything that can be grown in
[1:10:28] the world
[1:10:30] right alongside the Dead Sea remember
[1:10:32] the Dead Sea there's no living organism
[1:10:35] in the Dead Sea you can't even sink in
[1:10:37] it you can't drown in the Dead Sea
[1:10:40] you can just lay out on the top of it
[1:10:42] and it'll hold you up quite so much
[1:10:43] consistency of salts and minerals
[1:10:48] I looked around there and I looked turn
[1:10:49] around look this away and that turns
[1:10:51] this the desert of a different thing
[1:10:52] they had just nothing back that way
[1:10:55] I looked at George Smith and I said
[1:10:57] brother George the Bible says that the
[1:10:59] deserts will Blossom like a rose
[1:11:02] I said look out across there and you
[1:11:04] know what was all around those trees
[1:11:06] salt
[1:11:07] now you explain to me how they how they
[1:11:09] stop that salt consistency
[1:11:13] now they're getting back into playing a
[1:11:15] little bit with it you can get some
[1:11:17] fertilizer from Jacob
[1:11:19] that comes out of the ocean
[1:11:21] it's edible
[1:11:25] come on
[1:11:26] you can eat it you can feed it to the
[1:11:29] deer she put it on the ground it
[1:11:31] fertilizes it
[1:11:32] still learning a lot of things but
[1:11:35] listen
[1:11:37] to look and see God in his reality
[1:11:43] and to see that God created all of this
[1:11:48] he made Mountains for people like
[1:11:49] mountains
[1:11:52] he made Flat Lands for people that like
[1:11:53] to him
[1:11:55] he made all kinds of things
[1:11:57] where you could just travel around and
[1:11:59] here in America the Most Blessed I've
[1:12:01] been just a little bit in other
[1:12:02] countries not much enough to see just a
[1:12:04] little but if you want to see uh if you
[1:12:06] want to go out and see uh Arizona and
[1:12:09] not do that away just just go over to uh
[1:12:11] you know where brother George Quinn is
[1:12:13] at in Ireland and it looks just like it
[1:12:15] it's beautiful
[1:12:17] but you think God made all of that
[1:12:20] just you and I farage
[1:12:24] that we could live on
[1:12:25] he thought that much about us he didn't
[1:12:28] make it all flat
[1:12:30] he'd make it all mount
[1:12:32] why because he he thinks about us
[1:12:35] amen all right but see this this world
[1:12:37] was a time that it didn't exist
[1:12:43] you agree
[1:12:44] even science says that it was once all
[1:12:48] together in one big ball burning like
[1:12:50] the sun
[1:12:53] and it was some Big Bang Theory they
[1:12:55] call it
[1:12:56] that an explosion took place and it
[1:12:58] swung off clinkers and things out
[1:13:00] through the space and all those became
[1:13:01] the Stars the Earth the the different
[1:13:04] things
[1:13:07] I don't have no problem with that
[1:13:08] because I got to come somewhere
[1:13:10] pretty good point
[1:13:11] I just don't like the big bang
[1:13:17] see I believe God just stood there and
[1:13:18] said
[1:13:19] let there be let there be let there be
[1:13:25] because he had in his mind what he
[1:13:27] wanted
[1:13:30] he wanted the world you and I could live
[1:13:31] on
[1:13:33] they say we're not the center of the
[1:13:35] universe I'll argue with them
[1:13:36] scripturally spiritually
[1:13:38] because this is where God's going to
[1:13:40] live one day why it's not just the
[1:13:42] center of the universe
[1:13:44] he's going to live here because the
[1:13:45] Bible says he saw the city coming down
[1:13:47] on the earth well he's going to be here
[1:13:49] all right but listen
[1:13:52] a beginning of a creation is a point I'm
[1:13:54] trying to make
[1:13:57] don't think of it being like starting
[1:13:59] points
[1:14:03] think of it as an expression of
[1:14:05] something that you know there was a time
[1:14:08] I was not a father
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:15] there was a beginning of being a father
[1:14:20] but yet within me was all of those
[1:14:22] abilities before then
[1:14:25] I just needed a wife I needed somebody
[1:14:27] to help me
[1:14:29] to bring forth children
[1:14:33] well see God he just he didn't need
[1:14:35] another person
[1:14:39] well why can't you think about it
[1:14:42] not another God went out
[1:14:46] the scholars will tell you that
[1:14:49] the logos the theophany the son of God
[1:14:55] it's just another form of God
[1:15:01] a form called in the Greek Scholars
[1:15:04] terminology it's called in morphe
[1:15:06] e-n-m-o-r-p-h-e I guess it
[1:15:09] in morphe
[1:15:11] it's taken from a like a stage act or
[1:15:14] play
[1:15:15] or that one person plays many parts
[1:15:18] but you got to go back and change your
[1:15:20] clothing see
[1:15:22] and then you can be one character and
[1:15:23] then you go change your closing you're
[1:15:25] another character you just keep changing
[1:15:26] clothing and you know decorations you
[1:15:29] become looking like another person
[1:15:33] and that's what the word comes from
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:37] and see God then begin to condescend
[1:15:40] downward that you and I could encounter
[1:15:42] could comprehend him
[1:15:46] as he did we come to Genesis 1.
[1:15:52] said in the beginning God
[1:15:54] created the heavens and the Earth
[1:16:00] that meant that
[1:16:03] not in the beginning like a time but a
[1:16:06] Time the Earth came into being
[1:16:09] see it's not in the beginning of it of
[1:16:11] doing it's in the beginning of a Time
[1:16:12] coming into being Earth
[1:16:14] huh well see back before then
[1:16:20] there was a time that he was
[1:16:21] self-existing
[1:16:23] he existed alone
[1:16:26] but in him he had these great thoughts
[1:16:28] these attributes of him
[1:16:31] he wanted to be a savior A Healer a
[1:16:33] father he wanted those things
[1:16:36] he could create angels and they could
[1:16:38] worship Him
[1:16:41] that would make him the word god
[1:16:43] but he wouldn't have any children
[1:16:47] angels are not children
[1:16:50] that's why they can only sing
[1:16:54] it was saying in job where the morning
[1:16:56] star sang together
[1:16:57] but then the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:17:02] all right then
[1:17:04] he could say
[1:17:08] Let There Be that's understandable to
[1:17:10] bring a world into being
[1:17:14] but yet we can back up
[1:17:16] into an understanding
[1:17:18] and see that God began to unveil himself
[1:17:24] to let you and I understand him
[1:17:27] as he did he began to
[1:17:30] think about what he was going to do and
[1:17:32] he didn't have to think it out like we
[1:17:34] think and change your mind well I better
[1:17:35] not do that I better do it this way
[1:17:36] better do it that way no no no he's
[1:17:38] first thought is perfect amen
[1:17:42] he said I'm going to bring into being
[1:17:45] mankind
[1:17:49] I'm gonna give that mankind free moral
[1:17:52] agency
[1:17:55] which is a right to choose
[1:17:58] God won't override your free moral
[1:18:00] agency to make you be saved
[1:18:05] if you don't want to be saved he won't
[1:18:06] save you he won't do it he's a great God
[1:18:09] but if you desire to be saved he'll have
[1:18:10] it ready for you
[1:18:13] so he said I'll just
[1:18:14] create man
[1:18:17] I know he's going to fall
[1:18:19] all I got to do is give him three more
[1:18:21] agency you remember we went over service
[1:18:23] after service that he can't create us
[1:18:24] wrong
[1:18:26] like my brother said as a Methodist
[1:18:27] preacher 12 years College you know what
[1:18:30] he said he said God made him wrong
[1:18:32] he said God can't judge me for being
[1:18:34] wrong I said you're wrong
[1:18:37] that's what I told him if you're wrong
[1:18:40] God didn't make you the Way You Are
[1:18:45] I said when you reach the age of
[1:18:46] accountability you had a choice
[1:18:49] you could desire to serve God or you
[1:18:52] could play around and now you went to
[1:18:54] your Highly Educated forum
[1:18:56] and you can't understand
[1:18:58] God never made you wrong where could God
[1:19:01] get anything to make anything wrong from
[1:19:08] agreed how could he make anything wrong
[1:19:11] when there's nothing for him to make it
[1:19:13] wrong
[1:19:15] so he made it right amen
[1:19:18] amen Adam and Eve were perfect standing
[1:19:20] there not Eternal and flesh no
[1:19:24] but the greatest he could make them
[1:19:26] but he knew they'd go wrong
[1:19:30] well see then you back up before then
[1:19:32] and you understand that
[1:19:37] that great God
[1:19:40] would begin to comprehend what he's
[1:19:42] going to do
[1:19:43] he's going to allow me and you to come
[1:19:45] into being
[1:19:49] knowing we would fall
[1:19:52] hey let's don't blame Adam and Eve
[1:19:54] come on
[1:19:56] it's like I say about the kids today
[1:19:58] what do they say you brought us into the
[1:20:01] world if your fault
[1:20:04] but we can take you out
[1:20:09] it's on the internet and the world can
[1:20:12] hear it but that's true
[1:20:15] right
[1:20:17] no no they wouldn't ever one of my kids
[1:20:19] ever said you brought me into the world
[1:20:20] so you're responsible for them
[1:20:28] I wouldn't have killed him
[1:20:32] might have beat him after that but I
[1:20:34] wouldn't have given them but the Bible
[1:20:35] does say be the child that won't die and
[1:20:38] I got scripture
[1:20:40] but listen
[1:20:43] God began to condescend downward to
[1:20:46] where you and I could understand him
[1:20:51] and then the terminologies would come up
[1:20:52] like logos theophany meaning
[1:20:56] something that cannot be seen
[1:21:01] is beginning to come into being to work
[1:21:03] and be seen
[1:21:07] right
[1:21:09] then you can understand
[1:21:12] that he's now fulfilling his plan
[1:21:16] because I finished the Plan of
[1:21:17] Redemption
[1:21:19] he's fulfilling his plan
[1:21:24] all right
[1:21:26] then knowing that
[1:21:31] all of these things would come into view
[1:21:35] there's no problem with me saying like
[1:21:36] this
[1:21:37] what was the first creation see now I've
[1:21:40] laid down all this time to say creation
[1:21:41] to get this one point to you okay
[1:21:44] now remember
[1:21:47] creation beginning is not our human
[1:21:49] terminologies when you're speaking in
[1:21:51] spiritual terms
[1:21:54] our human terminologies of beginning and
[1:21:56] creation means a starting time
[1:21:59] all right
[1:22:01] but in Bible terminologies it doesn't
[1:22:03] mean that it means something that was
[1:22:05] here that was invisible could not be
[1:22:07] seen by any form of
[1:22:10] I shot or anything
[1:22:12] and then it slowly begins to come into
[1:22:14] view
[1:22:16] and as it does
[1:22:19] the spiritual eye first catches
[1:22:23] see before it could come into view
[1:22:26] and then it becomes to unfolding down to
[1:22:28] where we can understand him
[1:22:33] and to see that the first creation was
[1:22:35] God himself
[1:22:37] he said well boy you strapped no eyes
[1:22:40] the whole message on lining up to that
[1:22:42] now
[1:22:44] not a beginning not a starting point
[1:22:52] Jesus was not a starting point for God
[1:22:55] Jesus loves God Amen amen amen amen amen
[1:23:01] the only begotten the Bible said hath
[1:23:04] declared him declared means bring him
[1:23:06] out into the orphan where he can be seen
[1:23:10] amen Jesus said if you've seen me
[1:23:12] you've seen the father
[1:23:17] see if we quit looking at our own
[1:23:18] natural thoughts and and take the Bible
[1:23:20] terminologies of what we're thinking
[1:23:22] about the beginning is not a starting
[1:23:24] point then
[1:23:25] a beginning is a basis of when something
[1:23:28] becomes into view
[1:23:34] see then God who never had a beginning
[1:23:36] starts condescending
[1:23:40] and there was a beginning to his
[1:23:42] condescending
[1:23:45] a beginning to the basis he's going to
[1:23:47] reveal himself
[1:23:51] the prophet of God explains it one day
[1:23:53] like this he said when that
[1:23:56] back there to where it said let there be
[1:23:58] he said it was like a child playing
[1:24:00] before the father's door what
[1:24:04] there's no problem using Son of God
[1:24:06] there
[1:24:08] speech oh gosh speak it
[1:24:11] let there be
[1:24:14] and it was
[1:24:19] see we see all of these things come into
[1:24:21] being
[1:24:23] and we understand
[1:24:28] to see that God as he unfolds himself
[1:24:33] to reveal himself
[1:24:37] not just for being think with me
[1:24:40] suppose in some way that you could be
[1:24:44] pulled away from your family or
[1:24:46] something when you were
[1:24:47] were you know a baby was born and and
[1:24:50] you went somewhere and
[1:24:54] what would you do to that child to get
[1:24:56] that child to understand who you are
[1:25:03] come on you can produce paperwork all
[1:25:05] you want to child don't care about
[1:25:06] paperwork
[1:25:09] but what would be the thing that you
[1:25:11] could do
[1:25:14] you could begin to relate your life
[1:25:17] to that child
[1:25:21] and let that child just understand what
[1:25:24] you went through in life
[1:25:27] and that child begins to comprehend
[1:25:31] well you know that's what has happened
[1:25:32] to me
[1:25:35] I've been through this also
[1:25:38] now we have something that daddy and son
[1:25:41] can talk about
[1:25:43] he said my dad died when I was four I
[1:25:45] never had an opportunity to comprehend
[1:25:47] it
[1:25:51] but I'd beg Boris steel or whatever I
[1:25:53] could do for one moment for my daddy to
[1:25:55] be sitting right there
[1:25:58] listening to me preach about God
[1:26:06] you see some of you haven't had an
[1:26:08] opportunity to have your father mother
[1:26:10] with you for a long time
[1:26:13] praise that and thank God for it
[1:26:18] you know what it's kind of an odd to
[1:26:20] think about I'm just trying to close it
[1:26:23] and you see a little old child and like
[1:26:26] I said in the story he hadn't been
[1:26:27] around daddy very long he's been gone
[1:26:29] off and maybe when he gets to be eight
[1:26:31] or ten years old they get back together
[1:26:33] and he said you're my daddy
[1:26:36] well you know what ain't an odd that
[1:26:38] that you look around at your kids
[1:26:39] sometimes and and you start walking
[1:26:42] and you've got a certain way you walk
[1:26:45] do and
[1:26:48] and then you just turn around and watch
[1:26:49] your kid for a while
[1:26:50] you know what he walked just like you
[1:26:55] maybe I ain't seen you but how come
[1:26:57] it's just a nature it's a makeup
[1:27:00] the way you act the way you life the way
[1:27:02] you do and what you cut up and do
[1:27:05] the way you perform around them will let
[1:27:08] them know
[1:27:09] more than anything in the world
[1:27:12] that you're their parents
[1:27:19] see that's the way God wants
[1:27:22] right he wants his offspring his
[1:27:24] children
[1:27:25] to love him
[1:27:27] for what he is
[1:27:31] he died did you and I
[1:27:35] could have eternal life
[1:27:38] you said what you've been talking about
[1:27:39] an eternal God dying can't but the
[1:27:42] Eternal God an eternal God can't die I
[1:27:44] agree with you 100 percent
[1:27:46] see that's why he had to create that
[1:27:48] vessel
[1:27:51] and then stepped into that vessel
[1:27:54] and lived in that vessel for 33 years
[1:27:57] but one day on the cross he exited out
[1:28:00] of that vessel
[1:28:03] God didn't die
[1:28:06] the flesh man died
[1:28:09] but you know what he's so pleased with
[1:28:11] that until about three days later he
[1:28:13] picks it up and makes it eternal
[1:28:16] right and you know what he looks like
[1:28:17] today that same God
[1:28:19] it walked ashore to Galilee
[1:28:24] she'll get a different idea or thought
[1:28:26] about beginnings and Creations and
[1:28:29] it'll help us to comprehend
[1:28:32] what's going on
[1:28:35] because you see there was a day that you
[1:28:37] and I began as natural
[1:28:39] but the eternal life that you have in
[1:28:40] you makes you a new creature in Christ
[1:28:42] Jesus is that what Paul said
[1:28:46] we're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:28:52] I had a beginning
[1:28:54] time lies I'll have an end the flesh
[1:28:56] you're looking at
[1:28:57] but the god that lives inside of me
[1:29:01] had no beginning and had no end
[1:29:05] something happens one day and I have to
[1:29:07] die no problems
[1:29:10] that eternal life will just exit out of
[1:29:12] this body
[1:29:14] it'll take my soul and it'll be beyond
[1:29:16] the curtain of time waiting for a time
[1:29:19] to finish it all up
[1:29:22] because I believe in eternal life
[1:29:25] I believe you must be born again that's
[1:29:27] what he told Nicodemus
[1:29:32] not just a new thought or A New Concept
[1:29:34] come on brother
[1:29:35] but you must be born again
[1:29:42] the original translation if you'll go
[1:29:44] look it up
[1:29:46] it says You must be born from above
[1:29:51] I love to look at the original
[1:29:52] translation sometimes to comprehend see
[1:29:54] what it's meaning because that's what it
[1:29:56] says is you must be born from above
[1:30:00] you know why because that's where Jesus
[1:30:01] come from right
[1:30:05] he came from above
[1:30:08] because you must be born from above
[1:30:11] you must be born again
[1:30:16] to do that would make us a new creature
[1:30:22] but it wouldn't have a beginning
[1:30:25] the part that come into you and I is an
[1:30:27] eternal life had no beginning
[1:30:31] has no end to it let's stand
[1:30:34] what do we got 22 in the spiral book
[1:30:38] Victory in Jesus amen anybody have a
[1:30:41] knee the altar's open
[1:30:43] I heard an old
[1:30:52] ER gave his line on Calvary to save them
[1:31:04] I was precious
[1:31:15] you believe it oh Victory in Jesus
[1:31:35] I knew him and all my love is to him he
[1:31:42] punched me to Victory evening
[1:31:47] love I heard about his healing of his
[1:31:54] cleansing power revealing
[1:31:58] in the name of Jesus Christ Our Sister
[1:32:01] is asking for somebody else is in bad
[1:32:03] shape looks like he's no hope whatsoever
[1:32:06] yet we believe in a god
[1:32:18] in Jesus
[1:32:25] My Savior foreign
[1:33:27] Jesus my Savior forever
[1:33:44] and all my love this beauty
[1:33:49] lunch meat to Victory he beneath the
[1:33:53] cleansing flood
[1:34:14] okay
[1:34:25] father you heard our brother he just
[1:34:28] wants for you to have your way in his
[1:34:31] life and the ones around our Lord and
[1:34:33] all the concern
[1:34:35] father we know that you're working or
[1:34:38] this person wouldn't have called when
[1:34:39] they're doing so we just believe you
[1:34:41] you're working on both ends and make it
[1:34:44] all work out in Jesus name
[1:34:48] anybody else and just have a need
[1:34:50] punch me to Victory beat me
[1:34:59] amen you love him
[1:35:03] see I love him because I know he loves
[1:35:05] me
[1:35:06] because he's revealed himself to me
[1:35:09] that's the way that I know her for sure
[1:35:11] where I stand
[1:35:12] I believe his word
[1:35:15] he's made himself known to us through
[1:35:17] the opening of the word
[1:35:19] because that was the way it's supposed
[1:35:20] to be
[1:35:21] and just think on these things
[1:35:25] beginning doesn't mean a starting point
[1:35:27] like we think
[1:35:29] it means a time when something can't be
[1:35:32] comprehended then it can be comprehended
[1:35:39] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:35:41] that's according to the scripture that
[1:35:43] doesn't mean you as
[1:35:45] another person
[1:35:47] that means God has come down into you to
[1:35:50] give you eternal life
[1:35:53] so then you have a creation
[1:35:56] but not a starting point
[1:35:59] God is eternal

[1:36:03] everything to you and We Praise Your
