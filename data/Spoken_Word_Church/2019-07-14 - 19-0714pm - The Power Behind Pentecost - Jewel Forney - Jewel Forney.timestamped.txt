[15:06] brother let your my singing from me if
[15:23] you got your Bible just read a couple of
[15:25] scriptures distant say a few things that
[15:28] says it'd be a blessing to you I'm gonna
[15:32] read a book Satan first John st. John
[15:35] first chapter verse 12 and it reads like
[15:40] this so but as many as received him to
[15:45] them gave he power to become the sons of
[15:50] God even to them that believe on his
[15:54] name they were gonna read one who acts
[15:57] the first chapter in a verse for a
[16:04] separate versus but yeah shall receive
[16:08] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[16:11] upon you and and ye shall be witnesses
[16:16] unto me both in Jerusalem and injured in
[16:20] all Judea and in Samaria and unto unto
[16:25] the end
[16:27] unto the uttermost part of their one
[16:31] more scripture Hebrews the fourth
[16:36] chapter
[16:38] and I want to reread a verse from there
[16:41] I actually prefer first one and two out
[16:44] there and it says right here
[16:47] Hebrews the fourth chapter verse 1 and 2
[16:52] it says let us therefore fear lest a
[16:55] promise being left us of Internet to his
[16:59] rest and uh and it is really any of you
[17:03] should seem to come short of it for unto
[17:07] us was the gospel preached as well as
[17:12] well as unto them but the word preached
[17:16] did not profit them them not being mixed
[17:20] with faith in them days early that's
[17:24] thought I'd trust God that you would
[17:26] take these few words and give us a
[17:29] sprint Lord and speak to your peoples
[17:32] one more time
[17:32] father God hasn't give me on my script
[17:35] of this service but it's so spirit use
[17:37] it for your glory in the name of Jesus
[17:40] Christ we pray amen god bless you may be
[17:43] seated one moment thank the Lord for the
[17:46] reading of the word of God just this
[17:48] evening I looked at description here it
[17:51] says the Word of God not being mixed
[17:54] with faith probably there nothing he'll
[17:57] do that was driving I was looking at
[17:59] that they heard it but it didn't do him
[18:00] no good honey in other words him hey do
[18:03] you go to church you hid a word but it
[18:05] would win you win you you and you can
[18:07] heard over and over I wanted to move I
[18:10] don't want to take I want to see the
[18:12] word what power behind it and it was so
[18:15] we begin to look at him my title would I
[18:17] had looked out of the bread a list and
[18:19] pinnacles the power behind Pentecost and
[18:22] I looked at it I thought about Pentagon
[18:24] I said what was the power if you think
[18:26] about Peter
[18:27] what power came with pinnacle and I
[18:30] thought about that slave when the word
[18:32] upended even a damn pinnacle never had
[18:34] to be like mixing heard a one heard all
[18:37] the Jesus preaching they heard Jesus
[18:39] preached and they knew two things here
[18:41] buddy
[18:42] he still was not what he want to be
[18:43] never run they were hiding in the upper
[18:45] room because there was a friend and a
[18:47] public
[18:49] it had to be sublimates and on the day
[18:51] of pinnacle he'll come to power God came
[18:54] down and took it mixed the word and
[18:57] faith together and then they start
[18:58] preaching the gospel how lose that when
[19:00] the Gusman came real to him how do we
[19:03] know her in the world so pinnacle had
[19:05] power to mix the word and faith and I
[19:08] thought about that I say you know
[19:10] mission is a when Jesus was healed in
[19:14] the Old Testament it makes he took me he
[19:17] told him they kill a lamb and eat it so
[19:21] what you know each they take those lamb
[19:22] in I want you to eat the whole lamb I
[19:24] want you to eat everything with the lamb
[19:26] how do did he says but he put something
[19:30] else in it he they but would you put a
[19:32] little bit of bit of herbs in it and to
[19:35] really put that enough for the
[19:36] experience
[19:37] honey sober you'll have a testimony
[19:40] behind it
[19:41] honey you got an express behind it honey
[19:43] they eat the lamb
[19:45] so you go through your trial you can
[19:46] look back say God brought me from there
[19:48] okay I will do this I regard was living
[19:51] in I will do I know I was the one in
[19:55] pain but I know that my god in the hill
[19:57] I don't remember that I got a little bit
[19:59] of hurt and he loved us a little bit he
[20:02] makes this messenger in the word we had
[20:05] to eat a lamb we had to eat the lamb to
[20:07] eat the whole book and I'll tell you
[20:09] what it means that it will be better
[20:11] he put a little bit of business in there
[20:13] so when we go to our trials and
[20:14] tribulations we can look back and hurt
[20:16] with an experience like this is what God
[20:18] done for me I'll I bleed the word and
[20:21] the word stuff still for me and it was
[20:24] Jesus even told at one time except you
[20:27] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[20:31] no life in you you're gonna have to mix
[20:33] me Halloween we still doing it in same
[20:36] body type communion site we still mix it
[20:38] I lose if you don't mix it how do you
[20:41] gonna have some bit of trials if you
[20:43] don't take it you will help the trial if
[20:45] you take it outward so you know what do
[20:47] you two need to go back and get on your
[20:49] knees and make it right if we gain
[20:51] ticket so begin to look at me think
[20:54] about them Baines here and I were so I'm
[20:57] think I gotta get a chance more
[20:59] departing or going
[21:00] supporter that do get rid support doing
[21:03] it but let us say here bad guy brace you
[21:06] know he give us all you know we talk
[21:08] about wraps in faith this is I'm gonna
[21:11] don't want to say a few things before I
[21:13] can survive we talk about wrap your fate
[21:15] you say I wanna I'm gonna uh I'm gonna
[21:19] I'm gonna have a wrap here I'm gonna
[21:20] wrap some faith in a way and then we
[21:23] come to the time and a trial at
[21:25] something cut my way and we forget about
[21:27] it
[21:28] we you know we see like you see like
[21:31] every commandment
[21:32] well who got you what are you God is
[21:34] letting something take place God only
[21:36] give you a chance a trial so you can get
[21:38] a gain a testimony how do you know where
[21:41] he give you something because Joe
[21:42] couldn't never a preach on the
[21:44] resurrection until he had a trial until
[21:48] he had a test and with Joe got a test
[21:51] here and we're doing tribulation
[21:52] Hollywood a joke do he saw some that no
[21:55] other prophet so he saw Jesus coming out
[21:58] a grave in the resurrection he know he
[22:00] was automated it was through trial to
[22:04] gave him the great blessing and there
[22:06] were so you know and so we all need to
[22:08] have it but I like your it make us
[22:12] either when the Holy Ghost come up on it
[22:14] make a witnesses we become we got we
[22:17] begin to become a wind we we got a
[22:18] testimony i Lou you're done let me look
[22:21] at here on here let him pull up
[22:22] something real real quick in Hebrews 11
[22:24] first five here Hebrews 11 verse side we
[22:31] can pull up enough every day and I want
[22:35] you yeah we look at inna Jesse wake up
[22:47] with a chest he didn't wake up Holly you
[22:50] know just said I believe the message
[22:52] hello he he would put skin on the
[22:54] message how they insane time for the
[22:57] message to help skin on it so by in the
[22:59] words oh hey Weiser well I got famous
[23:01] he did not only did he have faith he had
[23:03] to mix that thing
[23:05] here to make it come real to him and the
[23:07] Bible says hell that's by faith Enoch
[23:11] was translated that he should not see
[23:13] death and was not found because God had
[23:18] translated him and him for before his
[23:23] translation he had here the testimony
[23:29] hardly any testimony and he had a
[23:31] testimony that he pleased God hallelujah
[23:34] the word it was something way with him
[23:36] he does it have a still or stillbirth he
[23:40] had a birth with life-image
[23:41] he had a testimony with life in it how
[23:44] do I know that my God is real
[23:46] how do I want to testify how do we say
[23:48] it so somebody ought to testify your
[23:51] devil don't want nobody to testify by
[23:53] the way oh you like you to do this well
[23:56] how's it well how you feel today yes I'm
[24:02] gonna die I guess you wield oh I guess
[24:05] you will if you're gonna tell like but
[24:08] that's just money like you I don't want
[24:10] to say nothing I don't want to get
[24:12] nobody to think of somebody how do you
[24:14] know the devil don't want you to say
[24:15] none and he tell you that because he
[24:17] know your testimony might like somebody
[24:20] else life somebody out might hear your
[24:22] testimony and you might be the one that
[24:24] called that person who receives of them
[24:26] God does what anyone hurt he's you know
[24:31] and the Bible says we overcome him by
[24:34] the word of our testimony hi the replica
[24:37] revelation teaches of that and by the
[24:39] blood of the Lamb so we got something to
[24:41] testify so now get back a few months ago
[24:45] I went through a great great setback it
[24:49] started in March you know started
[24:51] February and it started with just
[24:53] something that brother like I said it
[24:57] just hits you at once
[24:58] all at once my throat starts to closing
[25:01] up on me and I realized something's
[25:03] going wrong in my body for the first
[25:05] time I never had this happen and all of
[25:07] a sudden I've eaten my food and all my
[25:10] food was stop right here and went go
[25:12] down then I would put a throw it up for
[25:14] 10 days and I knew something was wrong I
[25:16] said something wrong
[25:17] I said my food and now I'm losing weight
[25:20] and stuff like this and I'm just
[25:21] throwing it right back so I say tell my
[25:23] wife I said I need to see a doctor and I
[25:26] go to one doctor they look at me they do
[25:28] bloodwork they send me back home and I
[25:31] can do blood work or they wouldn't tell

[25:40] me something I'm gonna be giving out my
[25:42] blood I mean I'm never gonna pay for God
[25:47] and everything but in a way didn't kill

[25:51] to go take some something over the
[25:53] counter like in house and man I said no

[43:08] quit why you think that John the Baptist
[43:10] was in the wilderness John the Baptist
[43:13] should not have been in the wilderness
[43:14] learning learning how to be a brother

[43:22] was a daddy hello Jones you knew how'd
[43:25] it go in there like the canvas knew how
[43:27] to do the showbread
[43:28] John was a pre I born in the priests
[43:31] house but God in our danger to be a
[43:33] priest he ordained John to be a prophet
[43:36] so he need John in the wilderness not in
[43:39] a not in the tabernacle so what'd he do
[43:42] they killed Zachariah
