[0:00] just lord open these things up to our
[0:02] heart as we study these scriptures lord
[0:04] today and and unpack the things that
[0:06] paul said
[0:07] uh thousands of years ago lord we ask
[0:10] that order you'll just be with brother
[0:11] wait as he's preparing oh god and open
[0:13] our hearts lord jesus to receive what
[0:14] you have in store for us today
[0:16] in your name amen
[0:19] now we're uh you know just just to kind
[0:21] of summarize what we left off in hebrews
[0:23] you know we paul paul kind of set the
[0:25] stage that we've heard from someone
[0:27] greater than all the prophets greater
[0:28] than greater than the angels the the one
[0:31] that we've heard through as god and
[0:33] heard from as god himself
[0:35] and and uh you know paul i i
[0:38] you know you read what paul's saying and
[0:40] sometimes it's hard to understand but
[0:42] he's it's such an encouraging message
[0:44] that he's bringing in the book of
[0:45] hebrews he's telling us to do do better
[0:47] than the israelites who who who kind of
[0:50] gave up in the wilderness who got so
[0:52] complained in the wilderness and and
[0:53] kind of got bogged down with
[0:55] uh with their own own desires and and
[0:58] and lost sight of what god wanted them
[1:00] to do to make it to the promised land
[1:02] and and paul is telling us to strive to
[1:04] enter into the into the rest enter into
[1:06] the rest that uh
[1:08] the rest of god's word we're not resting
[1:10] on our own works or or what we're doing
[1:12] in ourselves but we're resting on god's
[1:14] promises
[1:15] and then you know really the theme of
[1:17] the book of hebrews is
[1:19] we'll get to it in hebrews chapter 10
[1:21] that i've got here up on the sleep on
[1:22] the slide but
[1:23] the law is a shadow all those things in
[1:25] the old testament were a shadow of
[1:27] something that we have access to now
[1:29] that we're speaking of a life to come
[1:32] the life of christ will be given to us
[1:34] and all the things that you see in the
[1:36] in the old testament tabernacle and the
[1:38] rights of the high priest and the uh the
[1:40] the way that things were conducted all
[1:42] the the the way that that everything in
[1:45] the tabernacle was built and the way
[1:46] that the priest behaved and everything
[1:48] was a shadow speaking of of christ's
[1:51] coming that he would tabernacle himself
[1:53] and us and so really you know when you
[1:55] when you read through the book of hebrew
[1:57] read through hebrews chapter seven and
[1:59] and you you begin to look at what milk
[2:01] what paul's saying about melchizedek you
[2:04] really need to
[2:05] have it within that context of what that
[2:07] is to really understand it
[2:09] that that paul's he's trying to make the
[2:11] case that um
[2:13] the chickens are moving around my
[2:15] backyard again i gotta ignore that swipe
[2:17] one
[2:20] paul
[2:21] paul is trying to make the case that
[2:23] that the the law that there's the law
[2:26] has to change that the priesthood has to
[2:28] change there's coming a new covenant the
[2:29] covenant has to change and so he's
[2:31] sitting setting all that uh
[2:33] in view as he's as he's explaining about
[2:36] who who is this melchizedek who was that
[2:38] melchizedek so hebrews chapter 10 says
[2:41] for the law having a shadow of good
[2:42] things to come and not the very image of
[2:44] the things can never with those
[2:46] sacrifices which they offered year by
[2:48] year continually make the comers there
[2:49] and too perfect so what's paul trying to
[2:52] lay out for us in hebrews that that if
[2:54] you want perfection it doesn't come and
[2:56] he's writing to the hebrews it doesn't
[2:58] come by what you think god wanted you to
[3:01] to
[3:01] you know by by trying to fulfill
[3:04] some the the law about by working it out
[3:07] and trying to try to just be a good
[3:09] person trying to trying to be a good
[3:11] person like the uh the rich young ruler
[3:13] that came to jesus and said well i've
[3:14] done all these things but he jesus told
[3:17] the rich young ruler yeah but you're
[3:19] lacking something what you're what are
[3:20] you lacking you're lacking a
[3:22] relationship with christ you're lacking
[3:24] the life of christ a personal
[3:25] relationship with christ
[3:27] all of those things could i make the
[3:29] believer
[3:30] perfect
[3:31] perfection only comes by christ and so
[3:33] that's that's really who is melchizedek
[3:36] that melchizedek is the one that can
[3:37] make you perfect
[3:40] so
[3:41] you know we we need a we need a priest
[3:43] after the order of melchizedek we need a
[3:45] priest that could uh so paul in hebrews
[3:48] chapter eight he's saying for if that
[3:49] first covenant had been faultless
[3:51] then should no place have been sought
[3:53] for the second if that first covenant
[3:55] was faultless then you wouldn't need
[3:57] another covenant you wouldn't need
[3:58] another testament there was something
[4:00] lacking in that first covenant the first
[4:02] testament
[4:03] for finding fault with them he saith
[4:05] behold the days come saith the lord i
[4:07] will make a new covenant with the house
[4:09] of israel and with the house of judah
[4:12] not according to the covenant that i
[4:13] made with their fathers on the day when
[4:15] i took them by the hand to lead them out
[4:17] of the land of egypt because they
[4:18] continued not in my covenant and i
[4:20] regarded them not saith the lord
[4:23] now
[4:24] you you last time we talked about how
[4:26] that you know that they had been
[4:27] searching for that royal high priest to
[4:29] come that they looked for you know the
[4:31] requirements couldn't be met in the
[4:33] flesh by by abraham or by isaac or by
[4:36] jacob or joseph but when this man come
[4:38] out out of nowhere melchizedek he come
[4:42] here's the one that's going to be able
[4:43] to satisfy now maybe maybe just kind of
[4:45] set in your mind what's
[4:47] what's the difference between that
[4:49] melchizedek and jesus the difference is
[4:52] the melchizedek when he came he could he
[4:54] couldn't
[4:55] he couldn't uh
[4:57] god's got to come in the flesh to be
[4:58] your kinsmen
[5:00] so the difference is that when when god
[5:02] put that life in in that manger now he's
[5:05] manifested in the flesh so that he can
[5:07] bring to pass that new testament that
[5:09] new covenant
[5:10] that uh that god could come down and die
[5:13] for your sins and pay the price for you
[5:14] and atone so so the melchizedek couldn't
[5:17] usher in that new new testament
[5:19] he couldn't he couldn't move move you
[5:21] into that new new covenant but christ
[5:23] when he came he could and it's you know
[5:25] don't get in your mind that it's a
[5:26] different people it's the same god it's
[5:29] the same person the whole time
[5:32] now
[5:33] now you you talk about um
[5:36] let me see
[5:43] okay here we go let me get my slides
[5:45] mixed up so hebrews chapter seven when
[5:47] we were reading it says uh in verse
[5:49] three it says without uh well let's just
[5:51] read the whole thing again for this
[5:52] melchizedek king of salem priest of the
[5:54] most high god who met abraham returning
[5:56] from the slaughter of the kings and
[5:57] blessed him to whom also abraham gave a
[6:00] tenth part of all first being by
[6:02] interpretation king of righteousness
[6:04] what that's actually what melchizedek
[6:06] means mel
[6:07] uh
[6:08] melky is uh is is actually the hebrew
[6:11] for king and sedek is is a hebrew for
[6:14] righteousness so you know the hebrew i
[6:17] was listening to this rabbi talking
[6:18] about melchizedek and boy he was all
[6:20] confused he was saying that
[6:22] that paul raped jeremiah's words and all
[6:25] sorts of horrible things that but anyway
[6:27] the way that the hebrews pronounced
[6:29] melchizedek because they actually
[6:30] pronounced it as like two different
[6:31] words milky cedec so you take those two
[6:35] words king and righteousness and tack
[6:37] them together and you've got melchizedek
[6:39] means the king of righteousness
[6:41] and after that also king of salem which
[6:43] is king of peace without father without
[6:46] mother without descent having neither
[6:48] beginning of days nor end of life but
[6:49] made like unto the son of god abideth
[6:51] the priest continually now consider how
[6:54] great this man was unto whom even the
[6:56] patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the
[6:58] spoils now let's just rehash what you
[7:00] know looking at
[7:01] verse 3 there without father without
[7:03] mother without descent
[7:05] you know we talked last time about how
[7:08] that that god just just flipped
[7:10] everything that the jews understood on
[7:12] his head when he this man when christ
[7:15] finally came he come out of the tribe of
[7:16] judah in other words he just
[7:19] threw out all kinds of genealogy with
[7:21] somebody i think that's one of the the
[7:23] greatest uh
[7:25] misunderstandings that people in the
[7:27] message have is that that you're that
[7:29] your new birth or your eternal life or
[7:31] any kind of relationship you have with
[7:32] god is tied to any kind of genealogy so
[7:35] you see you see how god's just throwing
[7:37] that all the way out it's not he didn't
[7:39] he
[7:40] this christ did not come tied to any
[7:42] kind of genealogy like that but this man
[7:45] doesn't have a father or mother
[7:47] he doesn't you know you think about he
[7:49] think about christ when he came
[7:52] that that the bible says in matthew
[7:53] chapter one the birth of jesus christ
[7:55] was on this wise when as his mother mary
[7:58] was espoused to joseph before they came
[8:00] together she was found with a child of
[8:02] the holy ghost so mary wasn't his mother
[8:05] he was born of the holy ghost the holy
[8:07] ghost is the one that that created him
[8:09] in the womb that created that flesh that
[8:12] that his life was the holy ghost he
[8:14] didn't have joseph wasn't his father
[8:16] mary wasn't his mother because if you
[8:18] make mary his mother like like a lot of
[8:20] the denominational ideas then you got
[8:22] some kind of you got some really a
[8:24] perverted picture of how he came he came
[8:26] into life so so this melchizedek was
[8:29] without father and mother and then when
[8:31] he was manifest in the flesh christ was
[8:33] without father and mother because it's
[8:35] the same person
[8:38] the flesh the flesh is not what matters
[8:40] you see he took he just discarded all
[8:43] the genealogy or flesh has nothing to do
[8:46] with whether you're born again i wish i
[8:48] i wish we could kind of get get that
[8:50] completely burned out and baked out that
[8:52] we
[8:53] how you come in this natural life has
[8:55] anything to do with your with your new
[8:56] birth i was talking to somebody recently
[8:58] that's
[8:59] uh uh
[9:01] you know just
[9:02] well i'm not gonna get into that
[9:04] listen listen peter even peter when he
[9:06] uh when he began to preach and began to
[9:09] unlock the door he unlocked the door to
[9:11] the to the jews and the gentiles and the
[9:13] samaritans and who did he unlock the
[9:15] gentiles and the samaritans were the
[9:17] people that the jews thought they had no
[9:19] way to receive the new birth a gender a
[9:22] gentile dog or a samaritan that that uh
[9:25] that everybody looked down on that they
[9:27] don't even know where to worship a jew
[9:30] was thinking well we gotta we're special
[9:32] because of our genealogy and here god
[9:34] flipped everything on his head and gave
[9:36] the holy ghost to people that that they
[9:38] thought were just dogs
[9:41] why because there's a promise in the
[9:43] scripture whosoever will whosoever will
[9:46] let him come
[9:51] we've got a we've got a supernatural
[9:53] family tree
[9:54] we got a
[9:55] we got a genealogy that that that a
[9:59] genealogy of above that what's our
[10:01] genealogy genesis 1 26 27 that's our
[10:04] genealogy that you were predestinated in
[10:06] him
[10:08] so so what's melchizedek melchizedek was
[10:10] that life
[10:12] now brother and was saying who was
[10:13] melchizedek he said think of this great
[10:15] person of how great this man would must
[10:18] be which is what what uh
[10:20] what paul said here in in uh verse four
[10:23] now consider how great this man was and
[10:26] to whom even the patriarch abraham gave
[10:28] the tenth of the spoils so who was he
[10:30] you as a person
[10:31] a man a personality an eternal person
[10:34] brother adam said he was god because
[10:36] he's the only person that can be
[10:38] immortal and now god changing himself
[10:41] into person the same person the same
[10:43] person all the time veiled in flesh
[10:48] he was the suit the supernatural life is
[10:50] what melchizedek that life this behind
[10:52] the veil which was what paul says in in
[10:55] chapter six he says which hope we have
[10:57] an a as an anchor of the soul both sure
[10:59] and steadfast
[11:04] this hope we have as an anchor of the
[11:05] soul both sure and steadfast in it and
[11:07] which enterth into that within the veil
[11:09] which is that flesh the veil that he
[11:11] entered into is that flesh whether the
[11:13] forerunner is for us entered even jesus
[11:16] made in high priest forever after the
[11:17] order of melchizedek
[11:20] now now you see why how we we're tying
[11:23] together uh melchizedek come out
[11:26] seemingly out of nowhere the king of
[11:27] salem and he brought forth wet bread and
[11:29] wine and we're tying that we're tying
[11:31] that in together with with one day
[11:33] christ as when that melchizedek was
[11:35] manifest in the flesh there in the upper
[11:37] room he gave his disciples bread and
[11:39] wine i i hope i hope we can tie that
[11:41] together in our mind of what that's
[11:42] that's that same one that offered
[11:44] abraham bread and wine and now he's as
[11:46] he ushers in a new covenant he's given
[11:48] bread and wine to his disciples this is
[11:51] the new testament in my blood
[11:53] what's the difference now melchizedek
[11:55] couldn't bring in that new covenant but
[11:57] jesus could bring in that new covenant
[12:00] melchize jesus could because he come to
[12:02] die for our sins
[12:04] so in in hebrews chapter 7 and verse 22
[12:07] he says by so much was jesus made a
[12:09] surety of a better testament a better
[12:12] testament
[12:13] and they truly were many priests because
[12:15] they were not suffered to continue by
[12:17] reason of death but this man because he
[12:19] continueth ever
[12:21] hath an unchangeable priesthood
[12:24] he's got
[12:26] he's entered into the behind the veil
[12:27] not not a curtain in the wilderness
[12:29] behind the veil of your heart
[12:32] wherefore he is able also to save them
[12:34] to the uttermost that come unto god by
[12:36] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[12:38] intercession for them
[12:41] so now now see
[12:42] what what is what is this new custom new
[12:45] testament that he's speaking of the new
[12:46] testament in my blood there jesus
[12:49] up in that upper room he said after the
[12:51] same manner also he took the cup that
[12:52] paul's speaking of about the communion
[12:54] when he gets up saying this cup is the
[12:56] new testament in my blood
[12:58] this do ye as oft as you drink it and
[13:01] remembrance of me what is that new
[13:03] testament the new testament the old
[13:05] testament is is putting you in prison
[13:07] that you're you to to show you that
[13:10] you're you're in prison and you're you
[13:13] as as much as you try like david
[13:16] god said he was a man after his own
[13:17] heart but yet
[13:18] he was looking at bathsheba down there
[13:20] on the roof of her building uh taking a
[13:22] bath and
[13:23] you know he there his he needed
[13:25] something to to
[13:27] brother brown when i was listening to a
[13:28] message while i was working in the yard
[13:30] the other day and he said david had the
[13:31] word
[13:32] but what he needed was the spirit he
[13:34] needed that spirit to quicken that word
[13:36] to live in him that's that's the thing
[13:38] that makes you perfect that's what this
[13:40] new testament is the life of christ and
[13:42] the believer to perfect you and change
[13:44] your heart and change the way you think
[13:46] and change the way you live and and give
[13:48] you something that can that can fulfill
[13:50] the law
[13:51] so what's the difference melchizedek
[13:53] could it wasn't able to get you out of
[13:56] the prison house but this new testament
[13:58] will will break your chains but the new
[14:01] testament
[14:03] makes a way for you to get out of the
[14:04] prison house for the law to be satisfied
[14:07] in genesis chapter 14 we looked at it
[14:09] and melchizedek king of salem you see
[14:13] abraham paid ties to melchizedek because
[14:15] he realized he was getting something
[14:16] from this man he realized
[14:19] who this man was that he talked to god
[14:24] you know when you when you come to
[14:25] church and you you realize your chains
[14:27] are being broken and you realize you're
[14:28] hearing from god and you come expecting
[14:31] then then you come with a different
[14:32] attitude you come with a different
[14:35] a different outlook on things and you
[14:36] realize like abraham did this is the one
[14:39] that fought the battle this is the
[14:40] reason that i could come with only 318
[14:43] men and defeat all these all these uh
[14:46] like the the navy seals and the army
[14:48] rangers of chittel chitterly homer and
[14:50] all of them
[14:51] that he was able because god was on his
[14:53] side and it says he gave him tithe he
[14:55] gave him tithes of all
[15:01] because he recognized who he was serving
[15:06] well you know you know uh
[15:08] brother brown laid out and when he was
[15:10] preaching who was this melchizedek that
[15:11] melchizedek is one person all the time
[15:15] one god
[15:16] and he would say we find that many
[15:17] people teach his three personalities in
[15:19] the god's head so you cannot have a
[15:21] personality without being a person
[15:23] it takes a person to make a personality
[15:25] so who when melchizedek when abraham
[15:27] paid ties to melchizedek he was
[15:29] recognizing that one god when when when
[15:32] the three men came walking to him in the
[15:34] cool of the evening and he met him there
[15:36] in the tent door he he didn't recognize
[15:37] three different people three different
[15:39] gods or three different like like that
[15:41] but he knew who he that man was somebody
[15:43] that he had met before
[15:45] that's why in matthew 28 19 it says
[15:47] jesus said go and bapt and teach all
[15:50] nations baptizing them in the name of
[15:52] the father and of the son of the holy
[15:54] ghost and then in acts 2 38 it says
[15:56] peter said unto them repent be baptized
[15:58] every one in the name of jesus christ
[16:01] because this one god and jesus is his
[16:04] name what's what's the name of that king
[16:06] of righteousness that melchizedek king
[16:08] of rochester that came and talked to
[16:10] abraham
[16:11] his name is jesus christ
[16:14] jesus christ is his name because he said
[16:16] i come in the father's name i come
[16:18] wrapped everything that i stand for is
[16:21] everything that i am all my qualities
[16:23] all my attributes i come to represent
[16:25] that god that nobody knew who his name
[16:28] was in the old testament and all the
[16:30] time of god is changing himself and
[16:31] morph and morphine means change it like
[16:33] i'm putting putting on a mask where you
[16:35] change from one character to the other
[16:39] you know that uh
[16:41] maybe i'm i'm kind of running through
[16:43] some of these quotes a little bit fast
[16:44] so i'll try to slow down a little bit
[16:46] but
[16:47] and morphe comes from in philippians
[16:49] chapter 2 where it says who being in the
[16:51] form of god
[16:52] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[16:54] god
[16:56] but made himself of no reputation and
[16:58] took upon in the form of a serpent and
[17:00] was made in the likeness of men and
[17:02] being found in fashion as a man he
[17:03] humbled himself and became obedient
[17:05] under death
[17:07] and morphy means morphy is like morpheus
[17:10] the definition of it is
[17:13] the dictionary said english has no exact
[17:15] equivalent
[17:16] unlike form in english morphe does not
[17:18] mean shape it is a philosophical term
[17:22] that means the outward expression of an
[17:25] inner essence
[17:27] so on the outside
[17:28] you might look like uh you look like you
[17:31] know melchizedek come walking on the
[17:34] outside you look like like jesus christ
[17:37] on the outside start
[17:39] on the day of pentecost god put that
[17:41] same life into the believers
[17:43] so on the outside
[17:44] you've got uh uh you know a different
[17:47] believer peter and john in them but on
[17:49] the inside the inner essence is that
[17:51] life the same life that was manifested
[17:53] in melchizedek
[17:55] so brother ram said the greek word there
[17:57] in morphy means that one person is
[17:59] changing his mass to make him some other
[18:01] character
[18:02] what's the point paul is trying to make
[18:04] that this man christ jesus that paid for
[18:07] our sins that that
[18:09] that brought in a new testament
[18:11] is that same man that walked that walked
[18:14] and talked with abraham
[18:16] he said that's what god did it's the
[18:17] same god all the time god in the form of
[18:20] the father the spirit the pillar of fire
[18:22] the same god was made flesh and dwelt
[18:24] among us and morphy brought out so he
[18:27] could be seen and now that same god is
[18:29] the holy ghost
[18:31] you look i i got a little slide of
[18:33] showing a an actor you i don't know if
[18:35] you know who this actor is it doesn't
[18:37] really matter but
[18:38] this this actor portrayed like like
[18:41] putting on a mask he put on uh in one
[18:44] movie or one film or whatever he he he's
[18:46] portraying this first character and then
[18:48] the next one he's got a top hat on and
[18:51] the next one he's he's got
[18:53] he looks different and and the next the
[18:55] next he's got glasses on and each one he
[18:58] looks a little different but it's the
[19:00] same person all the time
[19:03] and brother brandman said and who is
[19:04] this melchizedek he said changing
[19:06] himself in morphy
[19:08] from one person it was taken from the
[19:10] stage act that one person is changing
[19:13] his mask
[19:14] to make him some other character
[19:19] and brother and we'll talk about how
[19:20] that in the beginning god dwelled
[19:22] alone and he said what made jesus and
[19:25] god different that jesus was the
[19:27] tabernacle that god dwelt in seed now
[19:29] melchizedek jesus had both father and
[19:32] mother and this man never had father and
[19:34] mother jesus had a beginning of life and
[19:36] he had an end of life this man had no
[19:38] father no mother no beginning of days or
[19:40] ending of life but it was the self-same
[19:43] person
[19:44] it was melchizedek and jesus was one but
[19:47] jesus was the earthly body born and
[19:50] fashioned after sin what was he saying
[19:53] he had a father and mother he he was he
[19:55] was he was born in flesh he come into
[19:58] the world
[19:59] so that he could be your kinsmen
[20:01] redeemer there's your there's your
[20:02] difference between this melchizedek
[20:03] melchizedek and jesus jesus
[20:06] could die for your sins and and and make
[20:09] a way for that life to come back into
[20:11] the heart of the believer
[20:14] but it's the same person all the time
[20:17] and who is this melchizedek he said his
[20:18] first being was spirit god supernatural
[20:21] all right the second the great eternal
[20:23] second he began to form himself towards
[20:25] flesh in a theophany called the word a
[20:27] word body this then as the state he was
[20:30] in when he met abraham was called
[20:32] melchizedek he was in the form
[20:35] of theophany
[20:37] he was the word
[20:40] so in verse six it says but he whose
[20:42] descent is not counted from them
[20:43] received tithes of abraham and blessed
[20:45] him that had the promises and without
[20:47] all contradiction the less is blessed of
[20:49] the better
[20:50] and here men that die receive time
[20:53] what's he what's point he's trying to
[20:54] make he's trying to make the point that
[20:55] the priesthood
[20:58] paid ties to this man
[21:00] that levi the priesthood came from levi
[21:03] so levi
[21:04] not just in tight but brother man said
[21:06] in the spoken word as the original seed
[21:08] levi
[21:09] paid actually it was counted as though
[21:11] he actually paid ties
[21:13] to melchizedek
[21:14] and so the priesthood
[21:16] that came from levi
[21:18] was less than this man
[21:20] melchizedek because he's the one that
[21:23] that made them the priest
[21:25] of the old testament
[21:26] and here men that die receive tithes but
[21:29] there he receiveth them of whom it is
[21:31] witness that he liveth and as i may say
[21:33] so say levi also who receiveth tithes
[21:36] paid tithes and abraham for he was yet
[21:39] in the loins of his father when
[21:41] melchizedek met him oh you you think
[21:44] about how that that levi levi actually
[21:47] paid ties
[21:49] and and you in the same way
[21:52] actually the life that you have by the
[21:54] new birth was actually there in that
[21:56] melchizedek wrapped up in him because
[21:59] you you are actually that your life is
[22:01] actually part of christ your life is
[22:03] actually part of him that's why we make
[22:05] the statement that as christ is revealed
[22:07] as you as you read the bible and you see
[22:09] the revelation of christ being made
[22:11] known and the word unfolds that it can't
[22:13] help but also reveal you because you're
[22:16] part of him so as his word is revealed
[22:19] to you you begin to understand you
[22:21] yourself and your own journey and your
[22:23] own life and how you fit into that
[22:25] because you're part of him
[22:28] that's that's what that's what the seven
[22:29] seals reveals this but you're replacing
[22:31] you placing you're putting you in as
[22:33] part of this as part of this great plan
[22:37] and brother i will say the thought when
[22:38] it's expressed it's a word a thought
[22:40] expressed as a word but it has to be a
[22:42] thought first so it's god's attributes
[22:44] then it becomes a thought then a word if
[22:47] you have eternal life you always was
[22:50] those who have tonight eternal life was
[22:52] with him and in him in his thinking
[22:54] before there ever was an angel star
[22:57] cherubim or anything else
[22:58] that's eternal
[23:00] and brother brown he made this statement
[23:01] and who was this melchizedek he made
[23:03] this wonderful statement that i love he
[23:04] said after he thought it he spoke it and
[23:07] here you are
[23:09] a manifestation a manifestation of that
[23:12] same life back there in genesis 1 26 27
[23:16] back there that talked to abraham that
[23:17] you were in him you were part of him and
[23:19] that's the story that's that god is that
[23:21] paul is trying to unfold that levi
[23:24] actually paid tithes it was counted to
[23:26] him even though
[23:27] even though he was
[23:30] what uh
[23:31] abraham's great-grandchild abraham isaac
[23:34] jacob levi and uh
[23:38] that god thought about you producing it
[23:41] and we're going to get into something
[23:42] really interesting here but you're
[23:44] as we kind of close and the music is
[23:46] just going to go ahead and come forward
[23:47] but we'll stop on this but brother and
[23:49] we'll say even though even though god
[23:51] thought about you
[23:53] brother around in the hebrews chapter
[23:54] seven he's laying the point down that
[23:56] what what you're doing right now
[23:59] is what matters your attitude towards
[24:01] christ will make a great impression on
[24:04] what your children will be
[24:05] your life that you live before your
[24:07] family will make an impression on what
[24:09] your children will be
[24:11] because the bible said that he would
[24:12] visit the iniquity of their parents upon
[24:14] the children
[24:15] to the third and fourth generation
[24:17] and in genesis chapter 18 the reason he
[24:20] said the reason i make all these
[24:21] promises in this covenant with abraham
[24:23] was because in verse 19 he said for i
[24:25] know him abraham that he will command
[24:27] his children and his household after him
[24:29] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[24:31] to do justice and judgment
[24:33] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[24:35] that which he has spoken of him
[24:37] and we'll just stop right there you love
[24:38] the lord this morning amen
[24:41] let's be in great expectation for what
[24:43] the lord has in store for us today and
[24:45] make the lord please
[24:48] with us and our thoughts and our actions
[24:50] this morning
[25:09] you
