[6:34] as we go to joke 28 I may have to give
[6:38] me some glasses here let's see there we
[6:45] go
[6:51] surely there is a vein for silver and a
[6:54] place for go where there is where they
[6:57] find it he set up an end to darkness
[7:06] and search with all out all perfection
[7:10] the stones of darkness and the shadow of
[7:14] death
[7:26] as for the earth out of it cometh bred
[7:30] and under it is tuned up and turned up
[7:34] as it were alive were fire I'm sorry
[7:44] there is a path which no foul knoweth in
[7:47] which the vultures I have not seen he
[7:58] put forth his band upon the rock he
[8:02] overcomes the mountains by the roots he
[8:13] binds the floods from overflowing and
[8:17] the thing that is he had been bringeth
[8:21] he forth to life man knoweth not the
[8:31] price thereof neither is it found in the
[8:34] land of the living
[8:43] it cannot be gotten for gold
[8:46] neither shall silver be weighed for the
[8:49] price thereof
[8:57] the goal in the crystal can not equal
[9:01] yet in the exchange of it shall not be
[9:04] for the jewels of fine gold the topaz of
[9:16] Ethiopia shall not equal it neither
[9:20] shall it be valued with pure gold seeing
[9:30] it is hid from the eyes of all living
[9:32] and kept close from the fowls of the air
[9:41] [Music]
[9:42] God understandeth the way thereof and he
[9:46] knoweth the place thereof to make me
[9:55] wait for the of the winds and his way of
[9:59] the waters by measure then did he see it
[10:09] and they declared it he prepared it

[14:43] by thy grace in Jesus name Amen okay
[14:48] visions 2 and verse 8 says for by grace
[14:54] are you saved through faith and that not
[14:58] of yourselves it is the gift of God amen
[15:01] let's turn it over to Ezekiel 36 got
[15:05] remember what we're doing we've been the
[15:07] own salvation now for quite a while
[15:10] talking about it and that's what we're
[15:12] doing with you know there from Ephesians
[15:15] that you're being you're going through a
[15:18] journey your Christian journey doesn't
[15:22] just happen all at once and everything's
[15:24] done you're constantly going through a
[15:27] journey and when it's all to where no
[15:29] matter how much you've been in the
[15:31] journey it's still of being born again
[15:34] something taking place each day in our
[15:37] hearts and lives until we walk off of
[15:40] this earth then our salvation will be
[15:42] complete alright now let's read it from
[15:45] Ezekiel 36 start verse 24 now what take
[15:55] you from among the heathen and gather
[15:58] you out of all countries and will bring
[16:00] you into your own land now this is this
[16:03] is a promise of a holy ghost land not
[16:08] just a form of returning Israel that's
[16:11] natural that that's natural right he is
[16:17] going to return him and he did return
[16:19] them to their land but now this is
[16:21] speaking further than just being you
[16:23] know that I'll gather you from the
[16:24] heathen and bring you back to your
[16:26] country see because watch then when I
[16:31] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[16:34] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[16:38] and from all your idols will I cleanse
[16:41] you a new heart
[16:43] I'll throw what I give you in the new
[16:46] spirit when I put within you and I will
[16:48] take away this is the only heart out of
[16:50] your flesh now I'll give you a heart of
[16:53] flesh and I will put my spirit within
[16:56] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[16:58] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[17:03] them then goes right back to the land
[17:05] right
[17:05] and you sealed well in the land that I
[17:07] give you and all because of this what
[17:09] caused land
[17:10] remember you can't understand Redemption
[17:14] without looking at the world in the
[17:17] redemption plan of man is the same for
[17:20] the world and it is for mankind heart
[17:23] because the world see went through
[17:26] justification are the cleansing in the
[17:28] days of Noah the blood wrinkled opponent
[17:32] in the days of the Lord Jesus one day
[17:34] has to get a fire baptism that's the
[17:36] same thing as we're doing we're going
[17:38] through justification sanctification
[17:40] baptism with the Holy Ghost and see
[17:43] that's where here that Ezekiel is
[17:46] showing bringing the people back to a
[17:49] natural land
[17:50] I've been he's showing bringing them to
[17:52] a change of heart
[17:54] then he's showing them right back to the
[17:56] land coat it all covers and that father
[17:58] we thank you for your word and we ask
[17:59] you to just bless each one got us then
[18:01] Jesus name you may be seated the Lord
[18:04] had his blessing to the reading of the
[18:06] word as I said we've been studying for a
[18:16] while about the plan of salvation all
[18:22] right and we're talking about what is
[18:24] the plant what is the new birth okay now
[18:28] they asked the Prophet and we believe it
[18:31] asking said is ever born again believer
[18:35] have to have this three stages of grace
[18:39] he says yes so we're talking with
[18:43] someone this morning about it see and
[18:45] I've tried to explain that over and over
[18:47] you said well did Martin Luther have
[18:49] Martin Luther had to go through
[18:50] justification sanctification
[18:52] baptism when the holder goes to have the
[18:54] new birth you say well now the Prophet
[18:57] said it wasn't no no wait a minute
[18:58] there's a difference in the age that
[19:02] you're in and the individual the age was
[19:07] the age of justification right but the
[19:13] birth was the new birth which was
[19:17] justification sanctification baptismal
[19:19] or ghost or either your prophet missed
[19:21] it when he said everybody has to have
[19:23] the three processes all right so you see
[19:25] we're holding it correct so in John
[19:27] Wesley's day you had the second work of
[19:31] grace as we'd call it coming into view
[19:34] under sanctification but as far as John
[19:37] Wesley John Wesley had to have the new
[19:39] birth right so everybody has to have
[19:45] that new birth so never never forget
[19:47] that part if you don't understand that
[19:49] question me about it later - what we can
[19:52] understand the doing but I have to stay
[19:56] with what the Prophet is saying to the
[19:58] point that and to be able to for it to
[20:01] fit together that anyone who has the new
[20:04] birth has to go through justification
[20:07] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:10] because every baby's born the same way
[20:14] water blood life all right so then we
[20:18] keep it in to that point all right and
[20:21] what we've been trying to do is to show
[20:23] what happens in that new birth grant the
[20:29] disciples as we said they spent three
[20:32] and a half years in their journey before
[20:36] they receive the completion of their
[20:38] salvation and the baptism of the Holy
[20:40] Ghost
[20:41] all right that doesn't mean we have to
[20:44] go three and a half years no no that is
[20:48] it can be at one time if you believe it
[20:51] but it's according to how you can
[20:53] believe when the house of canoeists they
[20:57] believed it and that was it on the 3000
[20:59] outside they believed it that was it but
[21:02] on the disciples it took three and I
[21:03] hear why because it was going to be
[21:05] written
[21:05] this is why keep emphasizing that point
[21:08] if you see what I'm getting at it would
[21:10] be written then in the book of Acts and
[21:15] the things and the Apostles and the
[21:18] writings in the Gospels to show what
[21:21] happens in our journey in life see they
[21:27] would be going through those three
[21:28] stages you know because they've repented
[21:31] of their sins and followed the Lord
[21:33] Jesus
[21:33] they were sanctified in st. John 17 all
[21:36] right but didn't get the baptism of the
[21:38] Holy Ghost until the day of Pentecost
[21:40] all right let's see it was put in here
[21:44] for you and me what if this had not been
[21:46] put in the world
[21:48] that's my whole point
[21:50] huh what has it not been not been put in
[21:53] the word what the Apostles went through
[21:56] for three and a half years you wouldn't
[22:00] have the four Gospels you wouldn't have
[22:03] the book of Acts and you wouldn't have
[22:06] any thing to tell you and be able to
[22:10] seal your your own salvation with the
[22:15] Word of God and to be able to say this
[22:18] is what the Bible says and so I believe
[22:21] it that way aren't you following me see
[22:23] I mean I've been much driving at these
[22:25] things to try to get that point to you
[22:28] to where we can see it all right now we
[22:33] took the little draw in the profit made
[22:35] on the message on the future home to try
[22:39] to show you know what happens in the new
[22:42] birth all right so let's pull that back
[22:44] up and just run a Feist quote through
[22:46] and get over to a point and then we
[22:49] don't want I have something I want to
[22:50] bring up on that so go ahead and
[22:52] brothers if you will and pull up the
[22:54] drawing yep there you go so we draw in
[23:00] the message called a future home he draw
[23:03] two hearts okay none of me I'm I'm sorry
[23:09] saying B I believe it's the same heart
[23:11] because of how he goes through to
[23:14] redemption all right now he didn't use
[23:16] that wording he draw two hearts
[23:19] he dropped one put a snake in it he put
[23:24] lines in it or something called it sin
[23:26] and then he draw one with a dove in it
[23:31] all right the first one represents us as
[23:35] we were natural born people everybody is
[23:38] born in sin they put in iniquity spouse
[23:41] from our mother's womb and a liar well
[23:44] not everybody doesn't matter who we are
[23:48] it's the same thing for all of us
[23:51] there's no shortcut cause you kinfolks
[23:53] we don't believe it nothing like that
[23:56] see the disciples some of them would
[23:59] have been hike brothers maybe to the
[24:00] Lord Jesus
[24:01] but that didn't shortcut it they had to
[24:05] go through the journey okay now what you
[24:08] see we took it to try to show that all
[24:11] born didn't sin okay here's your sin
[24:13] okay there's your snake that causes you
[24:16] to do it he says that snake in my heart
[24:20] we just read in the Bible and that was
[24:23] reason I emphasized it we just read in
[24:26] the Bible in Ezekiel then he's going to
[24:30] give him the land right the next verse
[24:35] he's dealing with the inward man to talk
[24:38] about taking away the stony heart then
[24:41] in a minute he's right back talking
[24:43] about the land when the Bible says in
[24:47] one of those this in there about the the
[24:50] sprinkle you honor is that the children
[24:56] is got got sprinkled maybe a Methodist
[25:01] might have that point you know that
[25:02] sprinkled but I still don't agree with
[25:04] but case you see then that's what it is
[25:08] over in the scriptures i believe it's
[25:10] ephesians what five where it talks about
[25:13] being washed by the water of the word
[25:17] now how are you washed by the water of
[25:20] the word I guess you need to get a bath
[25:29] No
[25:31] it's the opening of the word that washes
[25:36] us right it is the revealing of the word
[25:42] it is God revealing himself to us is
[25:45] what drives out that unclean spirit
[25:48] remember because it goes out of
[25:50] sanctification we'll see that's what I'm
[25:56] saying we we we take things and we will
[25:59] drift what does each one of that you
[26:01] know know the Bible is trying to show us
[26:05] like I said washed by the water of the
[26:06] word so we what we need to do now
[26:08] Wednesday night I want everybody to be
[26:10] here so we're gonna have a big tub up
[26:12] here and we're gonna give everybody a
[26:14] bath
[26:14] cuz that's washing you by the water of
[26:16] the word no that's silly
[26:20] that wouldn't save us that might make us
[26:25] cleaner but it wouldn't save us huh so
[26:29] what I want to wash by the water to work
[26:31] I want to know how this guy gets driven
[26:33] out he's driven out by the opening of
[26:39] the word or the revealing of the word
[26:45] and that comes about what Pryor's
[26:47] studying searching for God believing
[26:51] that drives that unclean out of us all
[26:55] right
[26:56] and we come to the point see that we
[26:58] that were clean so bring it up to the
[27:00] Word of clean and we'll shortcut the
[27:02] message part bring bring it up to the
[27:05] one where it's just what okay that's
[27:08] what you look like when you get through
[27:10] with justification and sanctification
[27:13] you're clean that's wonderful that's a
[27:18] great place to be we remember our
[27:21] message there the other day that's a
[27:27] dangerous stage because that unclean
[27:31] spirit jesus said went out of the man
[27:34] that snake and all that things went out
[27:37] through your repentance and you're
[27:39] following God and searching human
[27:42] salvation or
[27:45] but if you don't get something back
[27:47] there he's coming back and he's gonna be
[27:51] seven times worse right okay now so we
[27:58] got to deal with that part right there
[28:01] and I I emphasize it over and over and
[28:04] the last message now what would you
[28:07] that's you that's you that's your show
[28:11] it's called a heart by the Prophet
[28:15] because of Jesus saying as a man
[28:19] thinketh in his heart so is he
[28:21] all right the heart is the center of
[28:24] anything it doesn't mean this exact
[28:28] middle part its meaning the port calls
[28:32] his act to run or a peach you know a
[28:35] seed the seed can be over to the side
[28:37] you say well that's not a sitting on
[28:39] once that's the heart the heart is what
[28:41] makes you live is what you are and
[28:45] there's a man thinketh in his heart you
[28:47] don't think with your brain you say yeah
[28:51] I do no no you you try to it works to
[28:54] that part but the Bible says as a man
[28:57] thinketh in his heart so that heart is
[29:01] the soul of man which is what you are
[29:03] your soul is your being your soul is
[29:11] your being of what you are
[29:12] it's your person cuz you don't get a new
[29:16] heart now it's what we read in Ezekiel
[29:18] I'll give you a new heart I'll take away
[29:21] your stony heart boy he just took it all
[29:25] out left it empty now see that's that's
[29:29] what our human minds like to say what
[29:33] happened what was the zekiel describing
[29:36] I give you a new heart
[29:40] what was he describing you don't take
[29:44] your heart out put another heart in but
[29:48] it's not the heart you are a being which
[29:54] that means you're a soul because that
[29:56] was what happened in the garden
[29:58] when man was created God breathed into
[30:02] his nostrils and he became a living soul
[30:06] he doesn't say became a living heart
[30:09] though he became a living soul of being
[30:13] a person all right you see that that's
[30:17] what you are you're a soul that's you
[30:19] see we just use the word heart but the
[30:23] heart is the soul of anything or the the
[30:26] what causes you to be there's a real you
[30:30] that's why the Bible says the soul that
[30:33] sinneth doesn't say the spirit and or
[30:36] the body
[30:37] it says the soul that sinneth shall die
[30:40] see the soul is the real you
[30:43] so that's worth cites you remember I got
[30:45] them all laying here you've got some of
[30:47] them so you know where that they found
[30:50] within the heart of man a little
[30:52] compartment that there's no nothing in
[30:57] it or whatsoever and science says what
[31:00] we believed that would be the abode or
[31:02] the place of the soul to me that's just
[31:05] it expression it doesn't mean we got a
[31:09] little inch compartment no more than it
[31:13] means that you think it I'm I'm about
[31:17] ten messages ahead studying you know
[31:21] that brother branham describes when
[31:23] you're born again that that new birth
[31:26] coming into your soul is like a button
[31:34] like a little bitty button
[31:41] that's exactly what that statue of a
[31:43] perfect man is you borned again but that
[31:49] don't give you everything then we got a
[31:52] long ways to go okay I'm trying to speed
[31:57] up you think I'm trying to slow down
[31:59] you think I'm dragging my feet over and
[32:01] over I'm trying to get a point across
[32:04] lean get a point across to you then we
[32:08] move on to the next point all right do
[32:10] you see one gamma that's you that's you
[32:11] it's clean that's beautiful that's your
[32:15] soul you've repented you've accepted
[32:19] Jesus Christ as your Savior you've been
[32:21] baptized to prove that you're your
[32:24] repentance is correct and you're walking
[32:26] in the Lord and you go daily through a
[32:29] cleansing of repentance and seeking
[32:32] after God and being guided by his Spirit
[32:34] and then one day the Holy Ghost will
[32:37] come and fill us but you see we haven't
[32:40] been taught the truth of the new birth
[32:43] what does that mean it's wrong that we
[32:45] haven't been taught we haven't been
[32:47] taught we Baptists Methodists president
[32:49] but even the cat I mean even the
[32:53] Pentecostals that teach the
[32:56] justification same things baptism oh I
[32:58] wonder if they know what they're talking
[33:00] about so I believe in a definite
[33:04] experience of justification a day when
[33:10] you repented of your sins and God
[33:12] forgave you and done away with that sin
[33:15] I believe that but that day you didn't
[33:19] have to get the new words because there
[33:22] was still a lot of problems we went
[33:24] through who are the Prophet covered it
[33:26] future home even when your sins are
[33:28] chopped off he said that does nothing to
[33:30] the future of your sins he says the
[33:33] thing that calls you to do it
[33:35] it still dire but brother dad I went to
[33:40] the altar and I cried and I played
[33:41] prayed and I accepted Jesus Christ I'm
[33:45] not saying you didn't go all the way I'm
[33:47] not saying that way you you take those
[33:49] wordings and you cut me off because it's
[33:53] possible to do
[33:55] but it'd be a hard thing to do to go
[33:58] throughout at one time that's what I
[34:01] keep beating on you beating on you three
[34:04] and a half years for the Apostles to
[34:06] come to a place that they could receive
[34:08] the Holy Ghost you know why so that
[34:11] could be put in the Bible to show you
[34:13] and me what it would take for us to come
[34:16] to a new work alright do you follow me
[34:21] they were just because you're swept and
[34:23] clean
[34:24] what is that soul let you come to the
[34:28] altar you repent of your sins chopped
[34:31] off you pie sin then you ask God to
[34:33] sanctify you cleanse it wash by the
[34:36] water of the word since your side is the
[34:40] Lord Jesus and st. John 17 sanctify them
[34:43] through thy truth thy Word is truth
[34:45] those through the opening of the word
[34:47] the disciples were set aside that's the
[34:50] same thing to happen to you and me all
[34:52] right but that makes us clean that means
[34:56] that soul is pure has no sin because God
[35:01] has wiped it out okay but let's give an
[35:07] example you come to the outer you prayed
[35:11] for your repent of your sins you go
[35:14] through justification you can go through
[35:16] sanctification them to be you set aside
[35:18] okay that puts you in a good place right
[35:21] now suppose it's about a week two weeks
[35:25] three months two minutes they don't
[35:28] matter before the Holy Ghost comes in
[35:33] who are you
[35:38] what are you
[35:43] I can find you by putting the snake back
[35:46] in I hope you mean know what I mean by
[35:51] putting the snake back in I can find
[35:53] your old nature are you with me I can
[35:58] put the snake back and find the nature
[36:00] of you but remember now I've got these
[36:05] where the Prophet is describing it then
[36:08] when you're born into the world as a
[36:11] baby I tried to explain that the other
[36:14] day to me that looks like a newborn baby
[36:16] to me a newborn baby has no sin no
[36:21] problems no troubles two three four
[36:25] years five years it's still it's
[36:27] beginning to do little things and it's
[36:29] not exactly right but it's not if your
[36:34] age of accountability yet all right see
[36:39] it but it's being motivated by the
[36:42] people that are around it and that's why
[36:44] I get on to your parents remember them
[36:50] children want to walk like you talk like
[36:53] you and act like you right I guess the
[36:59] tickle with Thomas I look at him
[37:01] sometimes they go walking off and here
[37:03] goes Richard Richards got that certain
[37:05] walk and he bent over just to her and
[37:07] he's walking you know and your ghosts on
[37:11] us we look like each other right even
[37:27] though it's not even born in the same
[37:29] family you wind up looking like each
[37:30] other I can explain that but we don't
[37:34] want to get into that language
[37:37] listen that baby is clean and pure for a
[37:44] long time but then all at once it begins
[37:47] to start changing the little nature is
[37:51] being born into that baby that's exactly
[37:54] what you are is a nature
[37:57] or a being or a person that little soul
[38:01] that's in there that you receive when
[38:04] you're born into this world as it was
[38:07] with Adam you come over here and every
[38:10] baby's born God breathes into its
[38:13] nostrils it becomes a living soul not as
[38:16] eternal as Adam that ain't gonna leave
[38:18] that over there but remember you're
[38:20] still a living soul right now that
[38:25] little soul starts being motivated it
[38:34] begins to act like mom and daddy
[38:38] well I'm because it's being mostly a
[38:41] nature is being made you understand what
[38:43] I mean but so would it would be born
[38:47] into a what would you call it a baby it
[38:49] would be born into a neutral state would
[38:51] that be a good word for you know what I
[38:54] mean neutral in other words it doesn't
[38:55] have anything but like I always say you
[38:58] take that little baby that's born in the
[39:01] hospital room right that little baby is
[39:06] born in the hospital room what's the
[39:08] first thing it hears nurses over there
[39:15] this is the new this is the the full
[39:18] moon and we're gonna work all night long
[39:21] do not at blankety blankety blank all
[39:23] kind of words is coming out a poor
[39:25] little old baby ain't got a tow the my
[39:31] baby didn't your note bad words worthy
[39:34] to get it I mean you go to a little kid
[39:40] it's two three years old right and a
[39:45] little kid standing there with cooking
[39:46] his hand cookie all over his face and
[39:49] you say honey did you get that cookie no
[39:54] now where'd that come from
[39:59] well I come from marvel line about two
[40:00] cookies now just don't be silly I'm
[40:03] trying to preach but it is kind of like
[40:06] we were live in it
[40:08] chiropractor of the other states when he
[40:10] was explaining about I think it was his
[40:12] grandson anyhow
[40:13] every little child was but ever it was
[40:16] they was praying for the little
[40:18] two-year-old not two-year-old
[40:19] praying for him praying for that little
[40:22] two-year-olds been have some the
[40:24] problems you know he said no Lord said
[40:27] you let Johnny you know her what his
[40:28] name was
[40:29] ain't I don't know exactly what I always
[40:31] say it but anyhow he wound up being that
[40:34] they were praying for that little one to
[40:37] listen to mom and daddy you know well
[40:42] when they finished praying the little
[40:44] two-year-old said Lord would you help
[40:49] mom and daddy to understand me okay
[40:52] [Applause]
[40:58] pretty good maybe not all the whole
[41:02] story but pretty good point
[41:04] but what are we if the unclean spirits
[41:07] going out all the things what are you
[41:09] you're clean but that's that nature
[41:14] you're just too clean Erin Roberts with
[41:20] Erin Roberts has got a nature away a be
[41:23] it he used to call me up on the
[41:27] telephone you need to be talking away
[41:30] and I'd be setting up in the middle of
[41:32] the night listening to him talking all
[41:34] at once
[41:34] it gets kind of quiet he's going wake up
[41:46] you called me on the phone I answer the
[41:49] phone you don't answer you don't say who
[41:52] is this you know my voice one because
[41:56] there's word nature's and I get what I'm
[41:58] talking about
[42:00] every one of us has got a nature not
[42:03] talking about that unclean that's the
[42:05] devil that snake represents the devil
[42:09] that unclean spirit
[42:12] since the devil I'm talking about us
[42:15] being born as people as babies and it
[42:21] takes a while for that change to make a
[42:23] nature within you right seven eight
[42:30] years old maybe what's it what's the age
[42:32] of accountability no nobody knows is
[42:35] when you're accountable so then that
[42:39] would be the point that until that age
[42:41] run-run says nothing's recorded are you
[42:47] with me
[42:48] nothing's recorded to the little feller
[42:50] till the age of accountability but he's
[42:52] already got a nature since eight years
[42:55] old okay just to the more point he's
[42:58] already got a nature he already knows
[43:00] how to lights heat steal and do
[43:02] everything we had to walk to get some
[43:05] things yesterday down at the hunting
[43:07] limb and there was Thomas come along
[43:09] behind me was having to carry all this
[43:11] stuff I said Thomas why don't you take
[43:14] the keys and go get the truck I wouldn't
[43:20] dare let him do it but we're just
[43:22] laughing about it huh let's see let's
[43:25] get what I'm talking about
[43:28] what is that between the point of
[43:31] cleanse and set aside for service of
[43:35] sanctification and the indwelling of the
[43:38] Holy Ghost to come in and live what are
[43:47] you and what are you doing well kind of
[43:49] a nature to I'll that unclean spirit I'm
[43:53] not talking about that snake being you
[43:55] that's the devil that's his doings
[44:00] that's part of his nature come in and
[44:03] stealing unto us we're all born and set
[44:06] to a certain way and we all live our
[44:09] lives we all have different natures
[44:12] different ways you know our thinking is
[44:15] different you like this car I like that
[44:18] car you like this food I like that food
[44:21] they we're all different
[44:25] let's just call that a nature a way of
[44:29] being and seeing them from the time you
[44:32] get sanctified till the baptism when the
[44:35] Holy Ghost comes in what are you
[44:44] you're what you was today before you a
[44:47] sanctified call the sanctification done
[44:51] which took the snake out
[44:52] he didn't take you out it took the snake
[44:58] out the motivator goes out right you
[45:04] still you you mean you get sanctified
[45:09] and you're so clean and perfect no
[45:11] you're not
[45:12] that's not eternal life sanctification
[45:18] don't give you eternal life that's not
[45:20] it
[45:23] it just gets you sacked or God can come
[45:26] and live so your father won't say it now
[45:32] this is clean this is and that's
[45:34] wonderful but God wants to fill that but
[45:40] did you get to point let me ask you one
[45:43] more time cuz they don't matter to me if
[45:44] you don't like the way I preach that's
[45:45] that's your business I do the best I can
[45:49] to explain something 10 times over and I
[45:53] finally get it explained maybe I'm
[45:55] explaining it to myself well alright I
[45:58] don't worry about it see when
[46:00] sanctification comes it claims that
[46:02] that's a soul that's you that's a being
[46:04] it cleans is that the snake goes out but
[46:08] you're still the same person it didn't
[46:14] change your height your higher you color
[46:16] you you didn't get young when you got
[46:18] sanctified it just takes out the unclean
[46:23] spirit and every what time it takes from
[46:27] there 30 seconds or 30 years or whatever
[46:30] don't matter whatever it takes in that
[46:33] period of time you're you you're right
[46:36] where you was the day before tonight
[46:38] when out you just lost the motivator but
[46:46] you're still an unregenerate edemen
[46:50] being I'm trying my best to explain
[46:55] salvation through the Bible
[46:58] terminologies in the prophets way of
[47:01] expressing it so we can really see what
[47:03] it is to be born again when I just went
[47:06] up the holler it accepted Jesus Christ
[47:07] my Savior you can't tell me I saved I'll
[47:09] tell you one you think it won't wait a
[47:12] minute now we're just your mean-looking
[47:15] attitude come from when I get out my
[47:18] righteous indignation give her down my
[47:23] righteous indignation gets all stirred
[47:25] up and one brother said that and one
[47:28] night in the ministers ministers meeting
[47:30] he was having and one brother said to
[47:32] the other one said when I get stirred
[47:33] after my righteous indignation the other
[47:35] one said when I get stirred up I'm mad
[47:40] he was telling the truth all right we
[47:44] get what I'm talking about
[47:45] what are you gonna do with that person
[47:47] that person is in a horrible condition
[47:54] with a wonderful condition a horrible
[47:58] because we went through the whole time
[47:59] there's where the unclean spirit can
[48:02] come back and when an unclean spirit
[48:03] comes back he becomes a religious person
[48:07] you remember that the Prophet said it
[48:10] becomes a religious nature he said
[48:15] that's why you can't tell that woman
[48:17] it's wrong to cut her her wear shorts
[48:20] and pants sometimes because the devil is
[48:27] inside the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[48:30] is in the spirit on the second room the
[48:33] bodies just are again between it too one
[48:36] day it's motivated this way the next day
[48:38] motivated this kind of way right so what
[48:43] are you gonna do
[48:48] you understand what I'm talking about
[48:50] that's a child when it becomes to the
[48:53] age of accountability and that thing
[48:56] starts going back to what it was that
[49:02] snake is trying to come back in not a
[49:04] snake come back crawling within you come
[49:08] on my brother Dale preaches like he's a
[49:12] snake crawled in there no and I'm like
[49:17] this at least you ought to be able to
[49:19] explain to your children brother Dale
[49:21] ain't talking about a snake instead of
[49:24] said why don't you go ask him I don't
[49:26] know what he's talking about myself
[49:33] there's one of them momma's and daddies
[49:35] enterings of the demons okay here's what
[49:44] I don't understand you will then come to
[49:45] help me ask me about it
[49:47] I'll try my best to explain it to you
[49:51] mmm get what I'm talking about now get
[49:55] to the point where we can move on it's a
[49:59] wonderful place to be when the unclean
[50:00] spirit goes out which is a dangerous
[50:03] place called anointed ones can come
[50:04] right back in there and that devil can
[50:08] come right back into that soul and that
[50:10] spirit can be unknown anointed with the
[50:12] Holy Ghost and you can go out thinking
[50:14] you're Christian the disciples heal the
[50:21] sick cast out devils all kind of things
[50:24] you can do every bit of that and still
[50:26] be lost okay now so we got to do
[50:34] something there we've got to replace
[50:40] that old unclean spirit an old root of
[50:45] evil and to do that the only thing that
[50:49] I know we can do is just take the word
[50:55] cause but that time we should be clean
[50:57] enough to believe what God says
[51:01] we ought to be to the bases we said Lord
[51:04] I've done maybe I don't understand but I
[51:07] believe you I believe you're trying to
[51:10] get me straight and get me lined up
[51:11] you're trying to clean me up you're
[51:14] trying to get me repentant and keep me
[51:15] that to that stage all right cause see
[51:22] now we're gonna get to this later I'm
[51:23] not doing it today but I know where the
[51:25] point and click two minutes ago so I'm
[51:28] gonna click it back okay but I ran him
[51:31] on the future home
[51:35] he said cleanse and set aside but to
[51:39] Bible when it says it and brother I'm
[51:41] used it or you're what Holy Ghost and
[51:54] with fire but the Bible says Holy Ghost
[52:01] and with fire what does it say and with
[52:04] fire I thought the Holy Ghost was fire I
[52:10] thought it was a burner and brother
[52:13] branham future home have you been
[52:15] reading there's enough of us left right
[52:17] there even though it's proved beautiful
[52:19] and clean there's enough right tired of
[52:21] still the Holy Ghost can't come in
[52:23] unless it burns out the things of you
[52:29] that's the next message maybe this
[52:31] evening we'll see Holy Ghost and with
[52:35] fire that's not two different things
[52:38] that's one thing that's taking place the
[52:41] Holy Ghost is coming in as it is it's
[52:43] just burning out all that's left
[52:47] remember if it's burning out then there
[52:50] was parts left sanctification don't
[52:55] necessarily give you a total new nature
[52:59] it just starts working on your nature
[53:02] your ways your be
[53:07] you see if there's that's why we need
[53:09] the Word of God well I don't understand
[53:12] because all I know is I just accepted
[53:14] Jesus Christ as my savior and you've
[53:16] been telling me ever since then and I
[53:17] ain't saved I ain't said that a time
[53:23] I've tried my best to leave his places
[53:26] because brother Branham did here
[53:29] this message is so wonderful that
[53:32] prophet answers ever question if you
[53:36] will take his answer he'll talk about
[53:42] justification he'll talk about you
[53:45] repent of your sins and said sure if you
[53:48] die right there you're on your way to
[53:50] heaven well you've done his repented of
[53:53] your sins right he gives an altar call
[54:00] he says come down here and accept Jesus
[54:02] Christ as your Savior then he'll turn
[54:06] around say now go in that room over
[54:08] there on the other side where they're
[54:10] praying for the baptism when the Holy
[54:12] Ghost right what's so marvelous
[54:17] everything he said you can put it in
[54:20] perfect order
[54:23] it's like justification chopping off you
[54:26] pipes then go to the invisible Union and
[54:30] read it chopping off your pipes then the
[54:33] next stage it's as though you never done
[54:35] it I'm talking about him saying it and
[54:39] then in a minute he says a real unit and
[54:41] do it well I want that real me that's
[54:48] the guy I'm trying to find is the real
[54:50] me because I'm wanting the one where the
[54:55] dove is put in and I realized if the
[54:59] dove ain't put in I'm in bad shape
[55:02] cuz I'm a religious person
[55:08] Ryan Judas was very religious
[55:15] Balaam was very religious Balaam knew
[55:24] how to contact God but Ryan made a
[55:29] statement one day to mean it just they
[55:31] just went true like that and I think he
[55:35] said to be a prophet in Israel meant a
[55:40] great thing
[55:45] you realize you cannot show me but one
[55:48] time that Balaam was wrong
[55:52] come on let's take her Bible for talk
[55:54] about it tell me anything else Balaam
[55:57] was wrong on until he faced Elijah but
[56:02] when he faced Elijah he went wrong
[56:06] there's no record that Balaam was high
[56:09] hitting and missing or he was a prophet
[56:12] of God the Bible calls you see what we
[56:18] think we know all about all of these
[56:20] things and then I come up and I say well
[56:22] hey look what about this what about this
[56:24] what about these things here your
[56:30] sanctification cleanses and sets us
[56:32] aside having our hearts
[56:38] Hebrews 10 says having our hearts
[56:43] cleansed or sprinkle by the water of the
[56:47] word or by the word being washed by the
[56:54] water of the word you realize every time
[56:57] we come to church every time we pick up
[56:59] a Bible every time we pick up a tape
[57:02] every time we start meditating on God in
[57:06] the right way you realize that can be
[57:08] our washing that we need
[57:18] every move we make
[57:21] the Bible says pray without ceasing the
[57:35] Bible said watching pray I remember a
[57:38] man down at work he said now you know
[57:40] what that means watching pray I think I
[57:43] do you know we ought to be constantly
[57:45] pray and he said no say it means you
[57:47] keep one out white prayin okay
[57:54] shake you a little bit and get you away
[57:56] from the doles part that you're in now
[57:59] let's move on
[57:59] all right so we need to do something to
[58:03] this because do you realize even though
[58:07] you're clean even though you're
[58:08] sanctified even though you washed out
[58:12] you're still not right the Dove has not
[58:17] come in you know what brother Branham
[58:22] said about Judas he said is where only
[58:25] problem was he didn't make it to
[58:27] Pentecost right had Judas made it to
[58:33] Pentecost he'd have been right there
[58:34] within the south
[58:35] well now that got to be that's okay he
[58:38] did what he wanted but listen through
[58:45] the revealing of the word is what
[58:48] cleanses us our heart our soul in other
[58:53] words washing not by taking a bath but
[59:00] washing by the water of the word so
[59:03] you're born to get it faith now that's
[59:05] the new birth the washing of the water
[59:08] of the word is what carries us up the
[59:11] pyramid you see what took this message
[59:13] Peter him preached this Peter found him
[59:16] preached this statue of a perfect man
[59:19] but they had no way to express it enough
[59:22] to where that could be brought Paul
[59:25] never speaks of the stature of a perfect
[59:27] man he
[59:30] catch that point maybe I'm talking about
[59:32] good pop the disciples preached the
[59:34] statue of a perfect man all brought it
[59:39] in to adoption cause he moved up into a
[59:41] point the here comes brother branham
[59:45] trying to show us how to go to the
[59:47] change of a body if we don't get that
[59:50] weaning worried about our nature and our
[59:53] ways and if you ain't concerned enough
[59:56] to be worried about you do it just
[1:00:01] remember when you're talking about the
[1:00:05] heart of mankind you're talking about
[1:00:07] his soul it's not just a heart to see
[1:00:14] that's why the Prophet didn't say sin
[1:00:16] see though they got he said they say
[1:00:17] that it could be the occupancy of the
[1:00:22] soul he didn't say it wasn't so he just
[1:00:29] put it detect they're explaining there
[1:00:31] was something there that wasn't in the
[1:00:33] animal life and could it be the soul so
[1:00:38] the souls not an inch square that's my
[1:00:41] point
[1:00:42] all right I don't think the Prophet was
[1:00:45] describing how that that is one-inch
[1:00:47] square
[1:00:47] well that's bigger folks who's got a
[1:00:49] bigger heart that's bigger folks got a
[1:00:52] bigger so called we've got a bigger
[1:00:54] square spot that's silly see that's why
[1:00:56] say Aaron II Aaron sitting there good if
[1:01:01] I get to trade so God want to trade with
[1:01:03] him if it's the N Square compartment but
[1:01:07] that won't work all right
[1:01:10] are you listening he then when the
[1:01:16] Prophet is dealing with it he's dealing
[1:01:20] with the point of trying to show us who
[1:01:22] we are and what's going on
[1:01:32] let's deal with that person let's think
[1:01:38] about go ahead and pull up zekiel I see
[1:01:43] I think it's number 5 I'm gonna start
[1:01:46] with these because it mentions it twice
[1:01:51] three times in Ezekiel the way is in
[1:01:58] Ezekiel only not over 36 so to keep over
[1:02:03] this it's in that in Ezekiel 11 he must
[1:02:07] have understood some things look what he
[1:02:10] said and I'll give them one heart and I
[1:02:19] will put a new spirit within you now
[1:02:22] I'll take away the stony heart out of
[1:02:24] your flesh and give them a heart of
[1:02:27] flesh now what's he talking about taking
[1:02:31] out a stony heart they'll run use the
[1:02:33] word crushed I like that one he said he
[1:02:37] crushed that old Tony are what does it
[1:02:40] mean now this is a point before we move
[1:02:42] in there I've taken out the stony heart
[1:02:47] would it not be what I was saying there
[1:02:50] I want to go that you take the snake out
[1:02:52] you take the sin out and you got the
[1:02:54] purity of the white heart so emblem
[1:02:58] standing there our heart becomes we
[1:03:04] called it hardened right you know we
[1:03:08] said well they've done hardened their
[1:03:09] heart they won't listen
[1:03:10] no that's terminology as we use and it's
[1:03:14] true in that doing but what is it saying
[1:03:20] see will use the disciples your stood
[1:03:25] Peter a stony heart
[1:03:32] but when God got through with him and
[1:03:35] I'm three-and-a-half here he'd really
[1:03:39] matter
[1:03:39] metella the old fellow died on that knee
[1:03:41] though he was still fiery end kind of do
[1:03:46] you understand what I'm talking about
[1:03:47] when you repent of your sins it's not
[1:03:51] your heart being hard and it becomes
[1:03:54] kind of mellow you know because that's
[1:03:56] your heart that's not that's the
[1:03:58] thumping gizzard that's your heart but
[1:04:02] something gives hurts not the soul the
[1:04:03] soul is who you are
[1:04:05] so God begins to work through us
[1:04:07] don't you remember that when you come to
[1:04:10] the altar and ask God to forgive you of
[1:04:12] your sins you started crying out to him
[1:04:14] you started going to church you started
[1:04:17] reading your Bible you started doing
[1:04:19] those things what had happened he
[1:04:24] bellowed your heart he took away the
[1:04:27] stony heart because the stony heart
[1:04:30] would be what was Cauldron to be stony
[1:04:31] would be the devil so he takes him out
[1:04:35] the unclean spirit there's a root of
[1:04:37] evil and now you're standing with a
[1:04:40] mellow heart not a different heart not a
[1:04:42] different soul not giving you another
[1:04:45] soul it's working on who you are and
[1:04:50] you're standing at the place that you
[1:04:52] can receive the new birth you understand
[1:04:56] that that it's not talking about taking
[1:05:00] away the stony heart he's talking about
[1:05:03] taking away the old you the old nature
[1:05:10] of you you ain't even dealing really
[1:05:13] with this unclean spirit
[1:05:15] other than that times got to go out to
[1:05:17] make it start where we can start being
[1:05:18] mellow you know what I'm talking about
[1:05:25] you remember before you become a
[1:05:27] Christian or is that you won't be honest
[1:05:33] see that's the problem I say something
[1:05:37] about somebody you know the first things
[1:05:40] I say I say you remember how you would
[1:05:43] and you sit there and say Oh
[1:05:45] maybe he's got a little discernment
[1:05:48] knows what I used to be
[1:05:49] I don't need discernment I am the
[1:05:51] discernment I'm here because I lived
[1:05:55] okay I lived I know what happened right
[1:06:02] when I joined the Baptist Church that's
[1:06:04] about all I done join the church not it
[1:06:12] took him about five years or six through
[1:06:17] the Baptist and to in this message to
[1:06:20] love me enough that he could give me the
[1:06:24] baptism when I old ago the last two
[1:06:28] years in this message before I'd ever
[1:06:30] received the baptism with the holy God
[1:06:32] and yet in that Baptist Church I was a
[1:06:35] deacon at 23 years of age teaching adult
[1:06:40] Sunday School classes you'd say well you
[1:06:47] know he was living a good life yeah and
[1:06:50] I believe God was doing that and I
[1:06:52] believe he was I believe I was justified
[1:06:54] and sanctified back there in that time
[1:06:58] of dealing with all of that I believe it
[1:07:00] because I know what happened you know
[1:07:05] it's like I told you before about it I
[1:07:08] was the type of person as a sinner
[1:07:12] not me I never was a fighter never was
[1:07:14] all kind of rowdy I was just
[1:07:17] you just didn't fool with me because
[1:07:21] that was the way I was I just didn't I
[1:07:23] just tell you don't leave me alone
[1:07:25] I wasn't argued to me if I wouldn't mean
[1:07:31] or fighting or anything like that but
[1:07:33] there was one thing that always bothered
[1:07:35] me it always bothered me that the Bible
[1:07:40] said if it's mighty on one's heat to
[1:07:42] turn the other one and I always said
[1:07:45] lord I don't know whether I got it or
[1:07:46] not because I was capable and they made
[1:07:51] this don't mean unto you but it isn't me
[1:07:52] I can understand in the old days the way
[1:07:54] they used to do you know you know how
[1:07:56] they used to do they get an argument
[1:07:57] they take gloves it's like the guy on
[1:07:59] slap him on the cheek no the Flavian
[1:08:00] they go shoot each other we said you may
[1:08:04] not be here I can understand that that
[1:08:06] was an insult you slapped him in the
[1:08:09] child it was an insult he had to answer
[1:08:12] you back I could follow that I always
[1:08:18] wondered could I live it one day at work
[1:08:27] this man was doing something he
[1:08:29] shouldn't have been doing pinching me in
[1:08:30] the wrong place they would always know
[1:08:32] what I'm talking about
[1:08:34] and I kept telling him I said leave me
[1:08:36] alone and he wouldn't do it
[1:08:45] I caught him sitting on the table and I
[1:08:52] intended to you set up on the table his
[1:08:54] legs hanging off I just walked up put my
[1:08:56] hands on his knees and I bounced on him
[1:08:59] if you don't hurt somebody that's a good
[1:09:00] way to do it just like anger knees then
[1:09:01] you'll bounce something they'll come up
[1:09:04] when he come up he come up and slapped
[1:09:06] me across the cheek boy he rung it good
[1:09:09] I just stood there and looked at I found
[1:09:19] out the end something went out I never
[1:09:25] said a word this didn't look daddy he
[1:09:33] got down off I tell you when he walked
[1:09:34] off he stayed away from me who about two
[1:09:36] hours
[1:09:37] no he's posted been working together
[1:09:39] it's homicide he went down the line he
[1:09:41] would I guess he's afraid what I'm gonna
[1:09:44] do finally he come back up apart
[1:09:47] apologize
[1:09:48] I said that's all right but I said told
[1:09:51] you not do what you're doing because you
[1:09:53] were he was painting in the wrong place
[1:09:55] and acted wrong you know what I found
[1:09:59] out at least I could stand that much of
[1:10:02] taste you ever thought like that no
[1:10:08] somebody ring myjob bless God I'll ring
[1:10:10] there's within the who we need to go
[1:10:12] back to the
[1:10:13] to the justification start over again
[1:10:16] though we ain't even got to that point I
[1:10:20] don't have to stand a big beating now
[1:10:31] but are you with me let's just read
[1:10:38] something better on them talk about and
[1:10:40] we go ahead to number four were brothers
[1:10:46] let's think about what he's saying so
[1:10:52] we've got to get that fool so it's gotta
[1:10:54] be brought full of the word let's listen
[1:10:58] to what he's saying
[1:10:59] and let him answer the questions and
[1:11:03] you'll see that he's talking about your
[1:11:05] soul and once you are what a wonderful
[1:11:11] thing it is to be it's off the message
[1:11:13] that North it not ok run it on up to
[1:11:18] paragraph 123 I'm back down excuse me
[1:11:22] pull back down a world make sure you
[1:11:23] understand because he was talking about
[1:11:26] the flesh he talking about the outside
[1:11:28] man the see taste feel feel smell in
[1:11:30] here ok you got it
[1:11:32] he's talking about that then he comes up
[1:11:34] watch him now inside of that as a spirit
[1:11:37] which you become when you're born in the
[1:11:41] earth now did we put the drawing up do
[1:11:45] we need that the white figure but sheet
[1:11:49] there that's what you are when you come
[1:11:52] in the earth the snake is what you are
[1:11:55] as you progress your life and I'm coming
[1:11:59] in and living on come on now look inside
[1:12:03] that is the spirit which you become when
[1:12:06] you're born in the earth you become a
[1:12:10] nature of being a person a spirit and
[1:12:14] the breath of life is breathed into him
[1:12:17] so God gives you the breath of life
[1:12:21] you don't give you the new birth he
[1:12:24] gives you the breath of life you are
[1:12:26] born
[1:12:27] a baby right with new with life then you
[1:12:35] start on that process then watch him of
[1:12:39] that nature cause look what he calls it
[1:12:41] that spirit is of a worldly nature now
[1:12:47] we're gonna get down to where the Bible
[1:12:49] said it'll give you a new heart and a
[1:12:50] new spirit and brother Brennan said
[1:12:52] that's where people missed it he said
[1:12:54] they think that new spirit is the holy
[1:12:55] spirit he said it's not he said that's
[1:12:57] the spirit given to you to live with he
[1:12:59] said cause you couldn't live with
[1:13:00] yourself
[1:13:03] okay that spirit is of a worldly nature
[1:13:08] now watch it more than brother anima so
[1:13:11] when he said something I read it and
[1:13:14] stepped back nothing god I wish I could
[1:13:18] be that way sometime but I don't want it
[1:13:20] all the time cuz it's too much with it
[1:13:22] I don't want what I got but look what he
[1:13:26] says because it was not given from God
[1:13:29] God can't give you the wrong nature now
[1:13:34] watch him he's just said he gives it to
[1:13:36] you but then he said it's not given this
[1:13:39] worldly nature is not given but it was
[1:13:43] given permitted by God your own nature
[1:13:50] in your ways was not given of God
[1:13:53] because God can't make you wrong how
[1:13:56] marvelous that prophet could bring it
[1:13:59] but God permits you to have a nature
[1:14:03] that you followed after you're dead and
[1:14:05] walk like him and act like him and and
[1:14:07] through your life and you become into
[1:14:09] that and you begin to act like people
[1:14:11] and do like people he permits you to do
[1:14:15] those things but he can't give it to you
[1:14:17] God can't give you something that ain't
[1:14:19] right so don't say Garten that's what my
[1:14:24] brother said he said God can't condemn
[1:14:26] me for being the way I am Methodist
[1:14:29] preacher with 12 years college he said
[1:14:32] he can't condemn me for being what I am
[1:14:34] he made me this way
[1:14:39] well what would you say I said brother
[1:14:43] he didn't make you what you are you made
[1:14:48] yourself what you are don't blame it on
[1:14:53] God it's your fault well he could kill
[1:14:57] me no yeah he could have kept us from he
[1:15:00] could have but he didn't choose to do
[1:15:01] that but look what he's saying now that
[1:15:04] spirit of a world in nature because it
[1:15:06] was not given from God than the word it
[1:15:09] didn't come from God for the wrong
[1:15:12] nature but it was given up permeated it
[1:15:15] was permitted in a clean nature that
[1:15:18] baby has nothing against it until it
[1:15:21] reaches the age of accountability your
[1:15:23] prophet said he said then God starts
[1:15:26] recording
[1:15:30] that's why babies go to heaven no matter
[1:15:34] what mama daddy is babies under the age
[1:15:38] of accountability go to heaven I love
[1:15:42] that can't blame the what else in know
[1:15:47] now you got that forever child that's
[1:15:50] born into the world is born in sin 17
[1:15:53] iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:15:55] lives you live like everybody around it
[1:15:57] that right so that person inside there
[1:16:01] is a sinner to begin with well because
[1:16:07] it's not eternal it's only permitted so
[1:16:11] it can't be nothing now it's got five
[1:16:15] inlets he's getting to this second then
[1:16:19] five endless I don't know whether I can
[1:16:20] call the runoff first I know it's top
[1:16:24] concepts and love and so I was conscious
[1:16:26] love reason there is five inlets to the
[1:16:30] spirit you can think with your body go
[1:16:32] excuse me you can't think with your body
[1:16:35] you have to think with your spirit
[1:16:44] don't tell your body you think with your
[1:16:47] spirit you can't have conscience in your
[1:16:53] body it just displays what you are well
[1:16:58] if it wasn't for this old body now Lord
[1:17:00] you made me this way thought my brother
[1:17:02] was saying he said he made my body to
[1:17:05] where it isn't he knows what it'll do
[1:17:06] nothing but he didn't make you that away
[1:17:09] you went wrong on your own okay what it
[1:17:18] has no mental faculties and it at all
[1:17:21] your body doesn't have any mental
[1:17:23] faculties you think you do you think you
[1:17:25] think we brought huh no there's
[1:17:27] something else with inside of you the
[1:17:29] Bible that's why it's so perfect then to
[1:17:31] say as a man thinketh in his heart his
[1:17:34] soul of the being of what he is but his
[1:17:36] spirit is what causes you to reason
[1:17:38] memory conscience and time but that's
[1:17:40] why did he'll get down here you know
[1:17:42] where we're getting to you get down out
[1:17:44] to the God can come on that so you have
[1:17:46] to think with your spirit you have to
[1:17:49] reason you can't reason with your
[1:17:51] physical being no reason doesn't see
[1:17:54] taste feel smell in here no I didn't
[1:17:56] tell where this is from this is one of
[1:17:58] the message and North it not 1965 8:15
[1:18:03] or 816 what if you're sleeping you're
[1:18:08] out your body is lying there dead but
[1:18:11] your spirit can still reason there is
[1:18:13] five senses that control that inside man
[1:18:16] and then into the last man which is the
[1:18:21] soul there's only one sense that
[1:18:23] controls that that is free moral agency
[1:18:26] free will to choose or to reject no I
[1:18:32] love this one no no that ain't the ones
[1:18:37] gotta go

[1:22:48] wording of what he's saying it'll
[1:22:50] straighten everything out it'll put
[1:22:53] everything into the correct order if we

[1:23:10] anointed ones can be anointed on that
[1:23:12] spirit that inside man can be just as
[1:23:15] dark as gonna be now that's bad at it
[1:23:19] the editor truth so you built on
[1:23:24] emotionalism Amen for emotionalism I
[1:23:27] love it the dealer you can shouting and
[1:23:31] oh no it's like I've always said the
[1:23:34] Bible says I'll have to give an account
[1:23:36] if the gifts don't work in this church
[1:23:44] I'll have to answer but you know what
[1:23:46] you got the gift you're gonna answer it
[1:23:48] didn't you well we don't believe in
[1:23:50] gifts at Lulla where do you get that
[1:23:52] from I ain't never told him you might
[1:23:56] hurt somebody else said thought that's
[1:23:57] what they talk about then what I'm
[1:23:59] talking about
[1:24:00] I'm the one to ask me if you want to
[1:24:02] know what I did I'm a firm believer in
[1:24:06] speaking in tongues and shouting never
[1:24:08] never spoken telling in my life but I
[1:24:10] believe in it
[1:24:11] I believe it's a part of God I believe
[1:24:16] in an emotional ism I believe anything
[1:24:18] that's got Holy Ghost is going about
[1:24:20] some emotions but now let's lay it down
[1:24:25] look through everything that shouts
[1:24:26] don't mean this got it everything speaks
[1:24:30] in tongues don't mean it's got it am i
[1:24:32] quoting the prophet see what he said we
[1:24:36] put those things on the basis of because
[1:24:39] we do this or don't do that that we're
[1:24:41] saved that ain't it yeah but what
[1:24:45] evidence of whether you're saved or not
[1:24:47] that's whether spirit in you agrees with
[1:24:49] the word if it agrees with the word you
[1:24:56] start saying they something working
[1:24:58] right what brought you where you are
[1:25:00] brother Dale sucked and guided me the
[1:25:08] bases have believed in the word you
[1:25:11] remember my story wouldn't read them all
[1:25:13] told me if you believed in prophets and
[1:25:15] we talked I said brother mo you know how
[1:25:19] to tell me nothing about brother Branham
[1:25:21] please tell me what he taught I didn't
[1:25:26] re I love them things I love to hear
[1:25:28] about all of the things that read around
[1:25:30] them doing in
[1:25:31] and the testimonies I love all that but
[1:25:37] I know too that ain't gonna save me to
[1:25:44] read the Bible ain't gonna save me to
[1:25:48] hear the prophets not gonna save me for
[1:25:53] it to be revealed to me and salvation
[1:25:56] will go with it that's why the prophet
[1:25:58] they said what he said what is the New
[1:26:00] Bern's runaround he's just a revelation
[1:26:02] of Jesus Christ personally to you all
[1:26:10] right there's the new birth well I never
[1:26:13] had no revelation brother
[1:26:14] well I'm sorry that goes that you get to
[1:26:23] a point to try to explain to them and
[1:26:25] they'll all come out and you you feel
[1:26:26] that well people thinks you're against
[1:26:28] the issuer against that I'm not against
[1:26:30] anything that's in the Word of God I
[1:26:35] always told you I believe the Bible I
[1:26:37] believe in a fivefold ministry to take
[1:26:41] this prophets message and break it down
[1:26:43] to us laity and I count myself as laity
[1:26:47] because I'm part of the body of Christ
[1:26:49] I believe in a fivefold ministry well
[1:26:54] but if some of you sisters has got some
[1:26:57] good revelation I'll listen to you and
[1:27:00] we'll make it a six fold ministry you
[1:27:05] know what I'm doing I'm not being wrong
[1:27:06] I'm telling you like it is I like
[1:27:12] brother wood we had a point he said an
[1:27:16] old Holy Ghost feel woman said self in
[1:27:19] that mountains if it serves God he said
[1:27:22] she'll help you if you'll listen
[1:27:29] talking about her brother the other day
[1:27:31] co musician next time my brother the
[1:27:34] other day and I said well they said he's
[1:27:35] why I've never believed the message I
[1:27:38] said you know why cause she's never
[1:27:40] heard if I call that name he'd just go
[1:27:46] haywire I said she never heard it
[1:27:47] because he never heard the truth right I
[1:27:53] don't blame her for not believing the
[1:27:56] message one because he never heard the
[1:27:57] truth exactly right not helpless that
[1:28:05] was to get to a place then we can
[1:28:07] believe God's Word
[1:28:10] and get settled into that of saying Lord
[1:28:14] show me if I need something show me what
[1:28:18] I need and hold my hand Lord let's not
[1:28:26] fail you understand we'll pick up this
[1:28:30] afternoon more longer the thought of
[1:28:32] what the Prophet was saying these that
[1:28:41] I'll give you a new heart
[1:28:47] okay I'll give you a new spirit he said
[1:28:54] that's still like right so then I put my
[1:28:57] spirit in you that's the Holy Spirit
[1:29:02] there's the new bar not a new heart
[1:29:05] called it can be cleaned and workable
[1:29:07] and work I'll give you a new spirit to
[1:29:12] live in to where you can get along with
[1:29:15] yourself he said but he said it ain't
[1:29:20] done until you get that God puts his
[1:29:23] spirit within you there's the Holy
[1:29:26] Spirit that's the new birth what do we
