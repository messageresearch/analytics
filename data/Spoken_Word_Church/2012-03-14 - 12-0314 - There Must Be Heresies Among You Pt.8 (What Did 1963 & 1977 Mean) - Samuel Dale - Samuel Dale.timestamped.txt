[2:52] uh wade and and johnny took me down
[2:55] today and walked me around on deer hunt
[2:57] land hoping that they would be able to
[2:58] shorten the message down tonight you
[3:00] know trying to wear me out for about
[3:02] three hours of fast walking but
[3:05] i can always sit down you know
[3:07] and not have any problems but
[3:10] we will not try not to be too long now i
[3:12] want to try to end up tonight if i can
[3:14] with the uh talking of the doctrines of
[3:17] the message and things and if you have
[3:20] anything that you've encountered you've
[3:23] heard of
[3:24] doctrines that are going around because
[3:26] there are new ones every day right you
[3:28] know that it's appearing every day among
[3:30] the message and what i've covered is
[3:32] nothing like uh all of the doctrines but
[3:35] you know just trying to cover major ones
[3:37] and but if you know of one and you want
[3:39] to
[3:40] want it to be discussed just give me a
[3:42] note we'll see what we can do and if i
[3:45] tell you i don't know then that's the
[3:47] best way to tell you know that that
[3:49] would be the answer that we do brother
[3:51] george quinn sent us a notice for us to
[3:54] pray
[3:54] about him and his journeys he's now in
[3:57] thailand
[3:59] and he will be going into vietnam and
[4:02] laos in the next coming week so he asked
[4:05] for us to remember him but the lord
[4:07] would bless him and during all of that
[4:09] time give him a safe journey all right
[4:11] amen
[4:12] any other announcements that need to be
[4:14] made
[4:17] okay
[4:19] father we thank you for your love and
[4:20] your grace we thank you for all things
[4:22] and we pray that you would just bless us
[4:24] now without understanding
[4:27] because the prophet of god said
[4:29] questions makes a strong church
[4:31] and when doctrines comes among people
[4:34] then as we read in your word there must
[4:36] need to be heresies among you that they
[4:38] that are approved may be made manifest
[4:40] so it's for our benefit
[4:42] that you allow these things to come
[4:44] among us
[4:45] because that way we will dig down and
[4:48] search out
[4:49] the truth in that way then we can know
[4:51] the truth we love you and we thank you
[4:53] just come on the scene tonight and be
[4:56] with each and every one of us bless the
[4:58] sick among us and remember the sick
[5:00] around the country the people that have
[5:02] requested prayer
[5:03] and things we ask you to be with each
[5:05] one we love you and we thank you in
[5:07] jesus name amen
[5:11] we've been on this scripture but we'll
[5:13] try to get through tonight
[5:15] and you know
[5:17] like i said if there's anything that you
[5:19] have and you want to be covered just
[5:22] give me a question and we'll try to
[5:24] um to get started on that okay
[5:28] uh first corinthians what am i in my
[5:30] second corinthians
[5:32] 18 19 okay
[5:43] i'm going to get into
[5:45] chapter 11. i'm going i still got my
[5:48] bible set where we had the communion
[5:49] okay i'm not going my marker
[5:52] i'm going the other way
[5:54] but i have a marker where the communion
[5:56] was at okay
[5:57] 11 okay 18.
[6:00] well first of all when you come together
[6:02] in the church i hear that there be
[6:04] divisions among you and i partly believe
[6:06] it for there must be
[6:08] must be also heresies among you that
[6:10] they
[6:11] which are approved may be
[6:14] made manifest among you all right
[6:17] it must be in other words it'll be there
[6:19] so you know we can look
[6:21] forward to things happening but we don't
[6:24] look forward to
[6:25] uh it coming that away but we know it
[6:28] will come because it is spoken in the
[6:31] word of god all right first peter 3
[6:33] verse 15
[6:35] but sanctify the lord god in your hearts
[6:38] and be ready always to give an answer to
[6:40] every man that asketh you a reason of
[6:42] the hope that is in you with meekness
[6:44] and fear that's right amen you may be
[6:47] seated over that is blessing to the
[6:49] reading of the word
[6:51] now on these doctrines i've tried to do
[6:53] the best that i could and i will try to
[6:55] end tonight
[6:56] with these couple of thoughts
[6:58] and uh as i've said to each one of them
[7:01] i try to base my answer
[7:04] up on the basis of what i have heard or
[7:07] know of
[7:09] and doing the best that i can of that
[7:12] and also the number two part of it is to
[7:14] always know that there are many
[7:16] different versions
[7:18] of these doctrines
[7:20] all right you you go and just say two
[7:23] souls well there's all kind of versions
[7:25] that goes with that
[7:27] and you know that these this group don't
[7:29] even agree with that group
[7:31] of the same thing but yet linking it to
[7:33] the same doctrinal point you know but
[7:37] you know so i'm just doing the best i
[7:39] can to answer
[7:40] to to this point
[7:42] now
[7:43] so tonight what we're going to cover
[7:46] we've already covered uh two souls two
[7:48] lords river jordan seven thunder virtues
[7:51] no holy ghost doctrine did brother brown
[7:53] come to john patlas uh do we believe
[7:55] right around was deity
[7:58] then we looked for another prophet to
[8:00] come
[8:01] would get adam injected seed into eve
[8:04] to save her
[8:06] like the tent doctrines and the things
[8:08] we've covered these
[8:10] and the reason i bring those out is if
[8:12] somebody just listens the message
[8:13] tonight then they can back up and
[8:16] and review and and listen to some of the
[8:18] things to the comments
[8:21] and i'm not the one with all of the
[8:22] answers you know my definition of a
[8:25] smart person
[8:27] is not one who has all the answers
[8:31] because their mind is so full until they
[8:32] got a lot of problems
[8:34] it's the person who knows where to go
[8:36] get the answer right that's the smart
[8:38] person all right so that's what we try
[8:40] to be in that form you know all right
[8:43] now
[8:44] there was a doctrine started back that
[8:47] was a matter of fact when we came into
[8:48] the message
[8:50] in 67 there
[8:52] um
[8:54] you know there was a doctrine around the
[8:56] people of the message that said
[8:57] redemption was over in 1963
[9:00] that when the lamb left the mercy seat
[9:03] come
[9:04] and you know took the book
[9:06] and revealed the word of god to the
[9:08] prophet that redemption was over
[9:11] and uh
[9:12] you know
[9:13] that was a big thing and i'm sure people
[9:16] still to till today
[9:19] believe it that way you know they still
[9:22] believe that it was over and all like
[9:24] that but what i want to do tonight is
[9:26] you know i'm not going to argue with
[9:28] anybody about it especially like with
[9:29] redemption over because it's like i told
[9:31] the people then i said well
[9:33] according to my bible redemption was
[9:35] over for the foundational world
[9:37] and then you're coming down here telling
[9:39] me it was over in a 63 or over in here
[9:42] you know and i said
[9:44] uh just go on because see and at that
[9:47] time
[9:49] what was the odd part of it was i was
[9:51] having to argue with people
[9:53] about the basis of where the redemption
[9:55] was over in 63
[9:57] and really was not born again at that
[9:59] time
[10:01] because it was 69 before i received the
[10:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[10:05] well then in 1969 they couldn't argue
[10:08] with me no more i wouldn't even listen
[10:10] to them i didn't listen too much before
[10:11] they right
[10:12] but i surely wouldn't listen after i
[10:14] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[10:16] and i had a personal experience right
[10:19] or something and you got a personal
[10:21] experience it's kind of like you walk
[10:24] out in your your front yard you know and
[10:26] and you look out there and there's an
[10:28] elephant in your yard
[10:30] well you go back in the house and you
[10:31] tell your wife said honey there's an
[10:32] elephant in the yard
[10:34] she says you're crazy
[10:36] ain't no elephants in this part of the
[10:37] country and i don't care whether one in
[10:39] this part of the country or where
[10:41] whatever it is everyone's standing out
[10:42] in the yard come on i'll show it to you
[10:44] you know
[10:45] so then that way you have something that
[10:47] you can link it all back to and then
[10:50] that way nobody can argue with you about
[10:51] it they just count you a nut and forget
[10:54] it
[10:55] and see that's what i said i'm not gonna
[10:56] spend much time
[10:57] on the basis
[10:59] of that i'm just going to make a few
[11:01] points why would brother brown give
[11:03] altar calls after 63 if there was no
[11:05] possibility of redemption that's right
[11:08] amen all right
[11:09] now you're making him a false prophet
[11:11] that's right you know by your your
[11:14] doctrine
[11:15] in other words you're making him a man
[11:17] that doesn't know
[11:19] anything and that's what a lot of people
[11:20] is trying to do today
[11:22] you know is to say brother ryan was
[11:24] wrong on this and brother ryan was wrong
[11:26] on that
[11:27] you know and uh
[11:28] you know they say the son of man
[11:31] this was one of the doctrines
[11:33] that the son of man came in 63 to
[11:36] straighten brother branham out
[11:37] well now i would invite you to go back
[11:40] into the message before 63 and you'll
[11:44] see that brother branham was
[11:46] in the office part of the son of man
[11:49] because he was having that son of man
[11:52] ministry now i know that it developed in
[11:54] higher form yes we agree
[11:56] but
[11:57] he already had the sign of the son of
[11:59] man that's right right
[12:01] right before the seals broke before the
[12:03] the 63 that people would all be talking
[12:06] about and seeing the son of man come to
[12:08] straighten the prophet out now if he
[12:10] didn't have it right
[12:12] who was it in the world to be able to
[12:14] come see those doctrines are brought by
[12:16] people
[12:18] that really in a background point in
[12:20] their mind and eventually they'll tell
[12:22] you what they're thinking
[12:24] and they'll run it back to where
[12:26] brother so-and-so
[12:29] was able to straighten out the profit
[12:32] well see then you're they're putting it
[12:34] on the basis of building themselves
[12:37] into the realm you know trying to be the
[12:39] son of man you know and all the
[12:42] different things like that so but that's
[12:44] this part beside the point
[12:47] my point's always been one thing
[12:50] it's damaging to tell young converts to
[12:53] it a message wouldn't it be something
[12:55] you're you're trying to convert somebody
[12:57] to the message
[12:59] wouldn't that be a situation you know i
[13:01] mean you're talking to somebody about
[13:03] the message
[13:04] and you say uh
[13:06] would you say 463
[13:09] but they don't even talk to you
[13:12] you know because you can't be saved now
[13:14] i mean that's what you'd have to tell
[13:16] them
[13:17] but wouldn't that be nice
[13:18] you know how would you like somebody to
[13:20] slap you in the face with that right
[13:22] when you first heard of this message
[13:24] well i wish you could be saved but you
[13:26] can't
[13:27] because redemption was over
[13:29] the prophet of god said don't you say
[13:32] those things that's right
[13:36] should we give older calls should we you
[13:38] know should we have uh missionary work
[13:40] and that he said why would you get the
[13:42] wrong idea about what i'm saying right
[13:46] well the lamb left the mercy seat
[13:49] the lamb left the mercy seat before the
[13:50] foundation of the world according to the
[13:52] bible
[13:55] but see this
[13:57] you know
[13:58] seventh seal brother said we're standing
[13:59] here watching what took place in glory 2
[14:02] 000 years ago
[14:04] why don't people quote those things
[14:06] but see it won't fit in their doctrine
[14:09] all right
[14:10] but now the main issue that i want to
[14:12] cover with you is what happened in 1963
[14:18] and then we have time we'll get to the
[14:20] 1977.
[14:21] what happened there
[14:24] everybody want to argue about this and
[14:25] argue about that
[14:27] you know and see it was saying that
[14:30] the rapture would have to come by at
[14:32] least somewhere in 63
[14:35] uh because the prophet would say that
[14:37] the end of the world will come by 1977.
[14:39] so they got to get a three and a half
[14:41] year period of tribulation to the jews
[14:44] to come in so they would say it had to
[14:46] take place in 63 and it's like i told
[14:48] you this brother called me and he said
[14:50] uh what do you think that was before the
[14:52] 63 before the easter sunday or
[14:55] good friday before good friday on 1963.
[14:59] he said what do you think about this
[15:01] uh rapture coming
[15:03] you know about easter sunday
[15:05] there in 63 you know
[15:08] and uh i said
[15:10] well i hope so
[15:13] he said well you just don't sound like
[15:14] you believed it
[15:16] i said well i'm just honest i just you
[15:19] know
[15:21] i'm just saying that
[15:23] if it comes praise the lord if it don't
[15:25] i'm going to be ready
[15:28] he said well they do have it figured out
[15:30] that they could be 40 more days in there
[15:32] because of the bible i said now you
[15:34] sound like you don't believe he's coming
[15:36] in 63.
[15:38] so you know people don't like me i'm
[15:41] sorry
[15:43] but why not just be plain
[15:45] and at least you don't have to worry
[15:47] about it that's right
[15:49] now it's on record here in this church
[15:50] and we'll get back to it after a while
[15:52] that i preached in 1974
[15:55] that we could go past the year 2026
[16:00] and not tear up what the prophet of god
[16:02] had to say about it
[16:05] and his own record has been there ever
[16:07] since
[16:09] but i wasn't looking for it to last that
[16:11] long
[16:12] no i was wanting it to come in a hurry
[16:14] but i was just saying what could take
[16:16] place
[16:18] yeah
[16:20] so then let's just get down to it you
[16:22] know and
[16:23] see that what is the mayan calendar
[16:24] supposed to run out this year
[16:26] you know everybody is i'll give you a
[16:28] little key
[16:30] you know that
[16:32] and i'm not making no doctor and i'm
[16:33] just making a
[16:34] statement in 19 and
[16:39] 16
[16:40] what was that
[16:43] i just checked this out to find out
[16:47] in that you know a tape
[16:52] in louisiana in 1962
[16:55] which was 11 27 62.
[16:59] brother branham said
[17:00] that that was the coming of the
[17:05] jubilee
[17:07] now i know he mentions jubilee
[17:09] of coming up like 1906 in 1956
[17:14] all right but he said the holy ghost
[17:16] fell in louisiana
[17:17] in 1962.
[17:22] well now you just add 50 to that and
[17:24] where are we at
[17:29] anybody counting that feist
[17:32] i'm not making a doctrine i'm just
[17:33] telling you what
[17:34] what's there
[17:36] this is 2012.
[17:38] according to my calculations if you
[17:40] added to 62 1962 you had 50 that bring
[17:44] you out to 2012.
[17:46] is that
[17:47] right you know
[17:49] i'm not making a doctor and i'm just
[17:50] saying
[17:52] that people don't even know how to count
[17:53] a lot of times
[17:56] let alone study it in a realm but see
[17:58] i'm sure that probably somebody's
[18:00] thought of that and beginning to break
[18:01] and in no way am i saying it i'm looking
[18:04] for the coming of the lord any moment
[18:05] that's right even billy graham said i go
[18:08] to bed at night looking for him to come
[18:10] he said if he don't come i get up
[18:11] looking for him to come
[18:12] now if that man could have that much how
[18:14] much more should you and i yeah
[18:16] all right
[18:17] now
[18:18] let me just say this to you about
[18:19] redemption being over in 63.
[18:22] run around let's pull that one up
[18:24] go ahead brother
[18:26] anderson let's pull that one up
[18:30] this was 1963 720
[18:34] 8
[18:35] which is after which is christ the mr
[18:37] god revealed
[18:38] after the opening of the seal and look
[18:40] what he says
[18:42] i don't say
[18:44] they're going to be eight saved now
[18:46] don't get that all wrong i never said
[18:48] that i don't know how many is
[18:51] be going to be saved in that that that's
[18:56] the that last moment
[18:58] to rapture
[19:01] the little bride
[19:03] it'll be a small group then frustrated
[19:06] again
[19:07] 1963 now after the opening of the seals
[19:11] he's saying that
[19:13] he don't know how he's going to be saved
[19:15] and he puts it to rapture
[19:20] but
[19:21] what what is matter with people's minds
[19:24] and i'll get off of this
[19:26] you mean you you've got children born
[19:29] and they're coming up
[19:31] and they're getting the age of
[19:33] accountability
[19:35] well john i'm sorry
[19:38] redemption's over 63
[19:41] you can't be saved
[19:43] now isn't that some more gospel well
[19:46] that's really
[19:48] enthusiastic isn't it you could really
[19:50] get overjoyed by yeah yeah
[19:54] i like what you said in the old
[19:55] testament when a man's prophecy and
[19:57] prediction didn't come to pass you ought
[19:59] to be killed right
[20:01] and in no way did i say that it had to
[20:03] be i've even extended it now that we can
[20:06] go to the year 2050 or 2000 or 3050.
[20:12] and i'll get to that in a minute and
[20:14] just tell you why i believe it that way
[20:17] you say well let me be on here that'd
[20:23] but it's like i told you about the
[20:24] brother you know he went and preached it
[20:26] redemption was over in 63 nobody
[20:28] couldn't be saved after then he went
[20:29] back one year later never sister in the
[20:31] church even the pastor's wife had either
[20:33] had a baby or was pregnant
[20:36] he had a quick revelation
[20:39] you know
[20:41] he said you'd be saved because you've
[20:42] seen your parents
[20:45] pretty good
[20:46] that's even better in the catholic
[20:48] church yeah at least they make you want
[20:50] to do something you know
[20:52] but now look
[20:53] church listen
[20:56] let's get down to sensible things
[21:00] what took place in 1963
[21:03] right
[21:05] they say that was the coming of the lord
[21:10] now brother branham said on the seventh
[21:12] seal
[21:13] quoting
[21:15] he said it's gone from you or maybe it
[21:18] might be questions and answers
[21:20] on it right you know he says it's gone
[21:22] from you and there's no way of you
[21:25] knowing it right
[21:27] but he said right around the coming of
[21:28] the lord now if you need that quote i'd
[21:30] be glad to get it for you
[21:34] he had no thoughts or anything in his
[21:37] mind of thinking as i said if he was
[21:40] given altar called after he believed
[21:42] redemption was over then that'd make him
[21:44] a false prophet
[21:45] because he'd be giving false hope to
[21:47] people
[21:49] of salvation
[21:50] see it just don't make sense
[21:53] but see everybody says well the lord
[21:55] came
[21:56] there's a lot of doctrines among the
[21:58] people of the message that the son of
[21:59] man came uh the lord came you know and
[22:02] all like that and i agree to some of
[22:05] what said because the son of man did
[22:07] step into his ministry right but like i
[22:10] said he had the sign of the son of man
[22:12] way before 60 before the opening of the
[22:14] seals right all right
[22:16] now you were to consider that point
[22:19] but now listen
[22:22] brother around's message didn't begin
[22:24] until 1963.
[22:28] it was not the years of preparation that
[22:29] he had to do the work of restoration
[22:33] the faith of the fathers had to be
[22:34] restored to the church
[22:36] or at least the gospel
[22:39] of the faith of the father before the
[22:41] seals could break
[22:43] all right
[22:44] that's just like when i get to it down
[22:45] there while then people throw it up to
[22:47] you about the 70 weeks of daniel brother
[22:49] rounds when it said it in the 70 weeks
[22:51] of daniel
[22:53] he said if you don't understand these
[22:55] daniel stephanie which you can't
[22:56] understand the seal
[22:59] now
[23:00] that's what he said
[23:02] but you don't hear that
[23:04] i mean
[23:06] all that was when he didn't understand
[23:09] and it's just like
[23:11] lord told me one time you know he said
[23:12] yeah we islamics we believe the bible's
[23:14] right in some places
[23:16] i said yeah in the places that you want
[23:18] to agree with right
[23:20] but before you don't want to agree with
[23:22] it you don't believe that's the truth
[23:24] right
[23:24] then because that's that's just the way
[23:26] it goes
[23:28] but now see
[23:29] you get into it so what happened in 1963
[23:34] the only person in the world who knew
[23:36] about the coming of the lord in 1963 was
[23:39] brought around
[23:40] amen now
[23:44] i mean how could it be anybody else
[23:46] right
[23:48] if he was the prophet
[23:50] you would have to come to him first
[23:53] amen
[23:54] now
[23:55] but the only way we can know the coming
[23:58] of the lord exists is for the coming of
[24:00] the lord to be
[24:02] an experience in our own lives
[24:05] so who had the experience back then that
[24:07] the prophet had
[24:08] when he says it's gone from you
[24:12] how can you claim an experience or
[24:14] something are we like the bad disease
[24:16] most of you would never know that and
[24:17] think about it but i tried to explain it
[24:19] over and over
[24:21] i walked there
[24:23] they said we got the holy ghost
[24:26] and you asked them how and they said
[24:28] cause they come over to the pentecost
[24:32] you know
[24:33] then come on that pentecostal i got it
[24:36] well where's your experience of it oh i
[24:38] just believe
[24:40] i i just accepted by faith
[24:43] i accepted my faith and he come on the
[24:45] deaf pentecost
[24:47] well where's that in the experience of a
[24:49] new birth right
[24:52] that's not an experience of a new birth
[24:54] that's right that's an intellectual
[24:56] conception right
[24:59] that's what people are doing they're
[25:00] saying that
[25:02] that god came and said the lord came in
[25:04] 63
[25:07] but when we have that experience that
[25:10] happened to the prophet in 63 then we
[25:13] can say the lord has come
[25:16] he then we'll say like the brother said
[25:19] blessed are they that believe the lord
[25:20] has come in this right what in our own
[25:23] experience
[25:26] one of the big man in the message said
[25:28] the third pool is for brother branham
[25:30] and the lord jesus and not for us
[25:34] well according to my memory brother
[25:37] brown said that the third pull
[25:39] was for the bride and the church
[25:43] and to the totally lost
[25:46] now that's my understanding if you need
[25:48] that quote be glad to find it for you
[25:52] which is the
[25:53] what took place in 63 sure god came to
[25:56] the prophet
[25:57] that was through the opening of the word
[26:00] that's through the those seals being
[26:02] broke
[26:04] but it was broke to the prophet
[26:06] not to you and i
[26:07] we wouldn't even most of us saved at
[26:09] that time or whatever right
[26:14] but see we claimed like i said we say
[26:16] like the baptist will
[26:18] i got it
[26:20] you asked most people where where they
[26:21] are in the pyramid
[26:23] and what they say oh we're right here oh
[26:25] this is the lady ocean age and the
[26:28] prophet of elijah
[26:34] they say we right here in this brotherly
[26:36] kindness
[26:38] how can you be there unless you birthed
[26:39] up to that right
[26:42] that's all i want to explain
[26:45] but you see that's where we just take
[26:46] something but the bible says no man can
[26:48] call jesus of christ what
[26:50] except it be by the holy ghost
[26:53] the prophet of god said by the baptism
[26:55] of the holy ghost is the only way you
[26:57] can say that jesus is the cry other than
[26:59] that you're just blipping what somebody
[27:02] says
[27:03] you're just quoting somebody else
[27:09] well the seals broke me because he broke
[27:11] the prophet
[27:15] now you and he read the book i don't
[27:17] need to read the book
[27:19] they broke cross the prophet broken
[27:25] i know see
[27:27] i know what people don't like me i
[27:29] understand that right but i have to be
[27:31] honest to you as a church amen that's
[27:33] right
[27:35] you know to tell you what i believe in a
[27:37] way the reason i believe it that's right
[27:40] i should be ready to give a reason to
[27:41] hold this within you
[27:47] see if you believe the lord coming 63
[27:51] and he's never come to you
[27:53] that's just lip service
[27:56] that's just saying what somebody else
[27:58] says
[28:00] when god has broken their seals to you
[28:02] then you can say the seals are broke
[28:06] until then it was just broke to the
[28:08] prophet right
[28:10] well we don't have to understand them
[28:12] things we we're just simple yeah you're
[28:14] simple all right simply idiots
[28:17] yep
[28:20] right
[28:23] that would be nice wouldn't it
[28:26] you know i always have which there would
[28:27] have been three gods
[28:32] huh
[28:33] you don't get my eyebrows over there
[28:36] because i might be able to pray to one
[28:37] of the three and get by
[28:40] you know i might get one of them on my
[28:42] side
[28:46] but that will work
[28:48] so we don't believe in three
[28:53] but just because that god came to the
[28:55] prophet didn't make god come into me and
[28:57] you
[29:00] right god comes to you and me by
[29:02] revelation god uses the prophet right
[29:06] now the only way it can come to you and
[29:09] i is by way of the prophet
[29:11] amen
[29:13] all right
[29:14] i found by being all
[29:17] about two or three weeks now that you
[29:20] ain't helped my throat at all
[29:22] saying don't worry about it
[29:24] never have
[29:26] and i thought when i would clear it up a
[29:27] little bit maybe i'll get better and i
[29:29] kind of believe it by not using it it
[29:31] got worse you know
[29:33] anything else but that's okay don't
[29:34] worry about it i whisper
[29:37] but now do you see what i'm talking
[29:38] about
[29:40] see in 1963 was a great thing that was
[29:42] when god came to the prophet that's
[29:44] right
[29:45] and by that coming of the prophet he can
[29:47] come to you and i because he could tell
[29:50] us what the bible says that's right
[29:53] right he can't reveal it to us right
[29:56] but he's not the revealer holy ghost the
[29:58] only revealer of the woman that's right
[30:01] but he could come and tell us what the
[30:03] word says
[30:05] and tell us these things
[30:07] all right we have the ability now
[30:09] to talk about the coming of the lord
[30:12] right
[30:13] whereas we didn't even have it back in
[30:15] organized religion he didn't have
[30:16] anybody talked about it at all they
[30:18] spoke a little bit of a tribulation
[30:20] coming a little bit of the end of the
[30:21] world they know what it was something
[30:23] happened this way
[30:25] but see then the prophet began to speak
[30:28] and bring forth the scriptures and time
[30:30] together
[30:31] and you could see
[30:34] right there
[30:37] but you see if you if you say that that
[30:39] he come to brother branham without a
[30:41] personal experience then run around and
[30:42] becomes your god
[30:44] right
[30:45] come on
[30:48] well i got a quote where he says he's my
[30:49] lord
[30:51] yeah
[30:54] i got one where he said if you make him
[30:56] jesus christ you'd be better off to make
[30:58] him man you make an antichrist right
[31:02] that's right
[31:04] let's see when are we going to get down
[31:05] to all of the messages we see as i said
[31:07] a moment ago now let me just get this
[31:09] point that
[31:10] rhetoric's message
[31:12] when he came
[31:13] into the world he had to do a work of
[31:15] restoration because we had gotten so far
[31:17] away from the faith of the fathers right
[31:20] it took him 30-something years this is a
[31:22] quote from him now 30-something years to
[31:24] be able to preach the stature of a
[31:25] perfect man took bread around
[31:27] 30-something years
[31:28] right
[31:29] to be able to preach it
[31:31] all right
[31:32] well if it took him that long
[31:34] then
[31:35] you know
[31:36] something was wrong with him or rush one
[31:39] and i know he want wrong lunch
[31:41] but maybe he didn't see it i'm like on
[31:43] the statue of prayer man he said i saw
[31:45] with this tied together just the other
[31:46] day out in the woods
[31:48] but people don't want to listen to those
[31:49] things
[31:52] you know
[31:53] but follow what i'm talking about now
[31:55] look at the next quote
[31:57] because i just put these in
[31:59] the coming
[32:01] he said well what what right are you
[32:02] saying that brother and his message just
[32:04] begun in this opening of the seals
[32:06] because that's what he said
[32:07] now i can find you a lot more than this
[32:09] but go to the rapture message is one
[32:11] real good one listen to it and you'll
[32:12] hear him making almost these statements
[32:14] but look what he says
[32:16] he's coming down to the point the
[32:18] admission to be revealed in the last
[32:20] days when the seven angels
[32:22] seventh angels message when not when he
[32:25] starts out doing this but when he begins
[32:28] to stay on his message
[32:31] right
[32:32] see
[32:33] not the years in preparation
[32:35] but when he begins to sound the message
[32:37] these mysteries will be revealed and
[32:40] there they are not knowing them
[32:42] and you people are a witness of that
[32:46] now
[32:47] his message begun because the others
[32:49] were the restoration
[32:52] the faith of the fathers was what the
[32:54] apostles taught
[32:55] you agree
[32:57] that's what they call that was the faith
[32:58] of the father
[32:59] that was in the bible
[33:04] so when brother brown came to in his
[33:06] message all of that years of preparation
[33:08] got him ready and sure the opening of
[33:11] the word brought god to the prophet
[33:13] amen
[33:16] it brought god to the prophet and he
[33:18] brought his own message
[33:20] go read the titles of the messages after
[33:22] the seals broke
[33:24] just take one of those little index
[33:26] books and just sit down and go in 63
[33:29] after the symbol and just read the
[33:30] titles of the sermons
[33:32] across the mystery god revealed
[33:34] who is this melchizedek future home
[33:37] marriage and divorce
[33:38] the token
[33:42] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[33:43] everything goes into eternal life amen
[33:46] why because it was the message we'll get
[33:48] back to it a little bit because he came
[33:49] on the 49th he came into seven church
[33:51] ages that's right
[33:52] to bring the message to you and i that
[33:55] to worthy we would be able to receive
[33:57] the truth in this day
[33:59] would you just say that that i know it
[34:01] because brother brown said it that's
[34:03] saying what somebody else says right
[34:08] i told you before that
[34:10] you know
[34:13] the brother in this message he told me
[34:15] and two more brothers he said i think
[34:17] y'all got the holy ghost one night well
[34:18] i know i didn't get it
[34:22] but you know those two
[34:24] until they left here
[34:27] declared they believe they had it
[34:28] because that he said they had it
[34:34] well i'm hearing some quotes from
[34:35] brother around him where he said people
[34:36] had the baptism and hold up
[34:39] but there's some arguments about some of
[34:40] the things
[34:42] of some of the people he said
[34:44] right you know what brother around said
[34:45] billy graham had the bad feeling
[34:47] or robert said the baptism went on
[34:54] was that of thus saith the lord from a
[34:56] prophet or was that a thought or what
[34:57] was it
[34:59] and just remember
[35:01] you have the baptism in the holy ghost
[35:03] every day of your life when you're
[35:04] spirit
[35:05] and still be lost
[35:09] what was he talking about
[35:14] well i want him to tell me i got the
[35:15] holy ghost that's good i don't know i
[35:17] wish he'd come tonight and just stand
[35:18] here and point out and have all of us
[35:20] tell all of us we didn't have it we
[35:21] could get down and see that'd be good
[35:23] all right but i i never ever wear god
[35:25] done it like that
[35:26] have you
[35:29] could that put your dependence upon a
[35:31] man
[35:33] my dependence upon jesus christ amen
[35:36] jesus christ was the message that came
[35:38] to the prophet turned 63 the fullness of
[35:40] the word to bring to you and i
[35:44] and without that they would have never
[35:45] been a rapture right all right what are
[35:47] we going to say as i said about the
[35:48] baptist i've got it just because it come
[35:50] on the day of pentecost
[35:54] when it comes to the lord coming 63
[35:56] brother you don't believe that yeah to
[35:59] the prophet
[36:01] i believe that to the prophet
[36:05] i don't believe you come to me and you
[36:07] right
[36:10] and i don't believe he's here just to me
[36:12] and you just because that you could say
[36:14] the prophets you know he come to the
[36:16] prophet
[36:17] we've got to have the revelation of the
[36:19] message
[36:22] it's not willing why don't we just take
[36:24] drunk and be married and go home and
[36:25] forget the whole time
[36:28] right
[36:33] but you see
[36:34] my dependence is upon the revelation of
[36:36] jesus christ amen
[36:39] you didn't say the revelation of william
[36:41] branham and you were earth it's in
[36:42] revelation of jesus christ in a new
[36:44] birth amen
[36:47] that's right
[36:50] this is the birth of the word
[36:56] i believe this message fine for the
[36:57] prophet just said is wonderful but i
[36:59] want it revealed to me
[37:02] amen
[37:04] just because he said jesus was god
[37:07] all right
[37:08] that didn't make me to understand it
[37:13] but we thought that was the baptist
[37:15] church
[37:17] come on
[37:19] baptist doctrine is one god
[37:22] i come from there i don't have to worry
[37:24] about it
[37:26] that was their doctrine
[37:28] but it was god in three persons blessed
[37:30] trinity coequal co-eternal
[37:34] they'll argue to death about one god
[37:39] then turn around and tear down the
[37:40] scriptures to try and prove a trinity
[37:42] yeah
[37:44] but then you know it's not a revelation
[37:46] right
[37:48] you know it's not right see
[37:51] but brother dallas it's the knowledge of
[37:53] it will paul run into a bunch of people
[37:55] that said one day when they had a good
[37:56] knowledge of jesus
[37:58] and he said have you received the holy
[38:00] ghost right
[38:02] since you've got all this head knowledge
[38:03] right
[38:04] right
[38:05] since you believed is that what he said
[38:08] have you received the holy ghost since
[38:09] you believe right
[38:13] that's why i always encourage you to
[38:14] seek the baptism with the holy ghost
[38:16] amen
[38:19] i've always said it and i always taught
[38:20] it i'd rather all of my life be seeking
[38:23] god to come at the end of it and tell me
[38:24] i had it all alone right then they're
[38:26] not sick of it all and come down the end
[38:27] of it he said because of your
[38:28] stubbornness you wouldn't seek me
[38:35] brother said they cried out for a
[38:37] refilling of the holy ghost in the book
[38:39] of acts
[38:43] any kind right
[38:47] maybe the reason we don't get a lot of
[38:48] things is because we don't cry out for
[38:50] it
[38:57] maybe we're not seeking god's heart
[38:58] treatment
[39:03] but donny and wade and i were talking
[39:05] today going down about this video that
[39:07] brother joe made for me about training a
[39:09] horse for
[39:10] my love or by fear
[39:12] and the man made a good statement in
[39:13] there he said the biggest portion of the
[39:15] people
[39:16] of the religious world you know
[39:17] christians we
[39:19] serve god out of fear well is that not
[39:20] what the prophet said most everybody
[39:23] serves god afraid of going to hell
[39:27] very few people serve god because of
[39:28] love right that's right
[39:30] do you love him enough that he sent you
[39:32] to hell you'd love me that's right
[39:34] that's the difference
[39:37] do you love him enough that if he sent
[39:38] you to hell you'd love
[39:40] me right
[39:43] yeah that's a lot of difference
[39:47] see fear
[39:49] will bind you to a set of rules and it's
[39:51] just what i told them
[39:53] i said don't understand
[39:56] i don't understand a human being
[40:01] people that are governed by fear
[40:05] will lay out a church
[40:08] just any time
[40:11] but if they're governed by love they
[40:13] can't wait until the door's over to get
[40:15] here amen
[40:18] amen is that enough
[40:22] so which one are we governed by fear or
[40:24] love
[40:26] you're not going to die and go to hell
[40:27] because you missed one service
[40:31] but it could be the reason you missed
[40:33] that one service might make you dangle
[40:34] to hell
[40:36] come on
[40:39] you say well they don't make no
[40:40] difference i don't have to go to church
[40:41] every service
[40:43] that idea right there in your mind
[40:46] is a false doctrine that's right
[40:50] and that's the devil talking and he's
[40:51] sure not the holy ghost because brother
[40:53] brown said the holy ghost in your heart
[40:55] he said you can't wait until the door's
[40:56] open that's right come on
[41:00] come on
[41:01] do we believe the prophet
[41:04] amen well brother dale you don't
[41:07] understand my problem huh i understand
[41:09] all of our problems that's a problem
[41:12] that's why i stay awake a lot at night
[41:14] and
[41:14] pray a lot as i understand all of our
[41:16] problems
[41:17] because i'm one of them
[41:20] look at all of that okay
[41:23] see people don't think i preach against
[41:24] this any other but they don't hear me
[41:26] when i just inject something and back
[41:27] away and go on because what good is it
[41:29] gonna do
[41:30] you can beat people all you want to you
[41:32] take a whip and hit a horse and beat it
[41:33] so much of the turn walk right straight
[41:35] to you lay his head on you
[41:39] but like brother donnie says for the
[41:41] rest of his life he'll try to wait to a
[41:43] change
[41:44] that he can get
[41:48] brother brown yet never heard him make
[41:49] the statement
[41:51] and you that never mute welcome you you
[41:53] don't know what an order he's talking
[41:54] about
[41:55] but he said i'm you will work for you
[41:56] all of his life to get you kick in the
[41:58] head
[42:02] because that memory is still there
[42:06] we used to have one that you could hook
[42:07] him up just
[42:09] change you hook up one side you better
[42:11] walk around that mule to the other side
[42:13] into a cup that's
[42:14] because you didn't he was going to get
[42:16] kicked
[42:18] he is just like he sounds asleep but you
[42:21] move that arm in the wrong place and he
[42:23] kicked the daylights out
[42:26] she's serving him by fear of love which
[42:28] one is it okay
[42:30] i enjoyed what the brother had to say
[42:32] about it that's what he was saying about
[42:33] training a horse
[42:35] you know because i could see it in my
[42:36] own christian life
[42:38] you want to do it joel would make you a
[42:40] copy of it and you can look at it all
[42:42] right now so everybody understand what
[42:45] i'm saying
[42:47] i believe god came to the prophet in
[42:49] 1963 amen
[42:53] i believe redemption was over for the
[42:54] foundational world
[43:00] but i hate to think that i could be able
[43:02] to raise a family and i have no hopes of
[43:04] redemption for them
[43:08] because of some silly idea
[43:10] that i had in my mind
[43:13] that's where we're going to get down to
[43:14] 77.
[43:17] see people say i don't make no
[43:18] predictions now i just said what the
[43:20] prophet said
[43:22] where are they now we're certainly 19
[43:25] and 1977 or quite a while right
[43:30] and i happen to know the brother where
[43:32] we first started the church i asked him
[43:33] the per question because it approached
[43:36] me with it about the 10th vision and i
[43:38] answered the question and i said what
[43:41] are you going to do with weekly 77.
[43:43] he said i'll get out of the message
[43:46] then he saw he's in front of his
[43:47] congregation he backed up and he said no
[43:49] i'd say we misunderstood the problem
[43:51] that's okay
[43:52] i gave him medicine without anyone
[43:54] didn't do it
[43:56] but a lot of people turned their books
[43:58] in sent them back
[44:00] and left the message
[44:03] but the biggest portion of the people
[44:05] just that went right on
[44:09] you agree
[44:10] right i mean there's more following this
[44:12] message today never happened that's
[44:14] millions
[44:15] like a million in africa
[44:20] it's man's following this message now
[44:24] what happened to 77
[44:30] well we don't understand that i agree
[44:33] i see you
[44:37] that's why you wouldn't talk about it
[44:43] but you see people don't want what
[44:45] brother branham had to say they want
[44:46] what they think he said
[44:53] like one brother was telling me
[44:55] you know
[44:57] about the brother and said what not see
[44:58] that what would it
[45:00] the ten commandments or something would
[45:01] not watch it
[45:03] well i know where he told him said you
[45:04] were going to watch the movie will be
[45:06] sodom
[45:07] if you want to know what the world is
[45:08] like
[45:11] but you see the computer has done a good
[45:13] job
[45:14] of quieting people's minds but you know
[45:17] what it had never changed anybody that
[45:18] had that doctrine
[45:20] because they knew they oh they just
[45:22] missed it in the computer they didn't
[45:23] hear what i heard
[45:24] i heard the prophet saying
[45:27] i was sitting there when he said it
[45:30] that's what was told me when i come in
[45:31] the message said you can't understand
[45:32] the prophet unless you was there to see
[45:34] his mannerism the way he spoke and his
[45:37] arms moving in his doings and
[45:39] his mouth was shaped a certain way where
[45:42] he could say this word
[45:49] oh that's wild and good folks
[45:51] but you know what i know i'm a sarcastic
[45:53] kind of a guy and i know that i'm
[45:55] arrogant but i'm
[45:58] playing where's all of this junk that's
[46:01] running around now that was back there
[46:02] in the in the 60s and the 70s and even
[46:05] in the 80s
[46:08] they ought to go back to the
[46:09] denominations right because they're
[46:11] already formed what in this life
[46:15] well we don't want to be deceived
[46:17] my one brother told me he told me he
[46:19] said i'm planting trees
[46:21] you know when that was 1977.
[46:24] he said i'm planting trees
[46:27] to get that spirit off of me
[46:30] i thought you supposed to repent i
[46:32] didn't know planting trees and i'm not
[46:33] making light of him but i thought
[46:35] planting trees didn't get rid of spirits
[46:37] i thought repentance got rid of spirits
[46:40] all right i know what the man meant he
[46:43] had an idea that we were going to get
[46:44] out of here and he didn't want no trees
[46:47] but at his own wedding he's going to
[46:49] plant some trees
[46:51] you know
[46:52] because he didn't understand
[46:54] that's it
[46:56] but like i said i preached it there in
[46:57] 1974
[47:00] and i've had the opportunity to preach
[47:02] that in one other church
[47:07] i preached a little bit in one church
[47:09] about it but not much
[47:11] but i have a call to one church to
[47:12] preach on that
[47:16] but you see
[47:17] i can stand here today and say 1974 and
[47:20] i got to take back here you pull it
[47:22] listen to it
[47:24] that we could pass the year 2000
[47:29] we could pass the year 2026 or more
[47:33] most of you that are here heard those
[47:35] messages
[47:37] took brother dean a long time to be able
[47:38] to break it down from
[47:40] real to real the cassettes then we had
[47:42] to get from that down to the mp3
[47:44] or cds
[47:46] but what did happen
[47:48] like i said something wonderful happened
[47:51] in 1963 right amen
[47:56] you and i are linked to 1963
[48:00] on the basis that god came to the
[48:02] prophet
[48:04] appeared to him and reveal the word to
[48:06] him amen
[48:10] that's a wonderful thing
[48:15] all of this about river jordan you know
[48:16] brother brown said that on the river
[48:18] jordan that was the greatest experience
[48:20] of all in the bible
[48:21] outside of this end time
[48:24] they don't put that one on there
[48:27] because it was a great thing that's when
[48:29] god came down
[48:34] and join themselves surely in the
[48:36] fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[48:38] amen
[48:40] tell him wait i've read over this in
[48:42] samuel reading samuel sometimes and when
[48:44] you come over with it that saul was
[48:46] going to be anointed and
[48:48] samuel told him he would be anointed and
[48:51] that god would change him to another man
[48:55] it's in the bible you won't take time to
[48:57] go back in there and find it read it to
[48:58] you since you'll change you to another
[49:00] man
[49:02] changed him to another heart
[49:05] when the anointing came on saul it
[49:07] changed him right and the baptist when
[49:09] the holy ghost come on me and you and
[49:10] they changed us
[49:11] come on
[49:12] right
[49:14] come on oh i got the baptism in holy
[49:17] ghost but not a change in my life
[49:19] well
[49:22] he was something wrong right
[49:25] but listen
[49:27] 63 was a wonderful thing
[49:31] 97 was a wonderful thing
[49:34] amen something took place in 1977
[49:40] it was wonderful
[49:44] nothing calls it i stood back there
[49:46] before then and said it could pass
[49:48] and i didn't make predictions
[49:51] i was reading
[49:53] and showing it from the bible
[49:58] i've heard sermons and you have to
[50:00] that a prediction by prophet is greater
[50:02] than
[50:03] all we could do and i agree that's
[50:05] probably right i'd rather have run
[50:06] around's predictions and all the mind
[50:08] your dust saith the lords if it ain't
[50:09] thus saith the lord but i'd rather have
[50:11] one thus saith the lord over brother
[50:13] brown's predictions
[50:16] okay
[50:18] now you see how blunt i am
[50:21] because a prediction is not a prophecy
[50:23] we're going to read that
[50:28] and i've heard sermons in a prediction
[50:29] with the thus saith the lord will show
[50:31] it to me in the bible
[50:36] but let's read some of the things
[50:38] brother randle had to say see people
[50:39] believe that that as i said they believe
[50:41] that the world the the rapture would
[50:43] have to come in 63
[50:46] because the end of the world would have
[50:47] to be by 1977.
[50:51] all right
[50:53] and see them that way
[50:56] that's been in man's mind but let's read
[50:58] some of the things brother brown have to
[51:00] say about 77 and i'll be glad for you to
[51:02] find me anything else other than the
[51:04] ones i got on here
[51:07] you know i mean i'll be glad for you to
[51:08] find me anything else he said about 1977
[51:10] and i would be glad to bring it here and
[51:12] read it
[51:13] because i run it as far as i could on
[51:15] the computer and all that i had in my
[51:17] own computer
[51:18] you know my own concordance of the rope
[51:21] but look what he says look at go back
[51:22] and go to number one on the notes now
[51:27] look what the prophet of god had to say
[51:29] you have to write it all up
[51:32] all right
[51:33] now you remember and i'll give you them
[51:35] in just a minute
[51:36] right around had seven visions
[51:39] and i'll give you between two quotes the
[51:41] seven visions that he had
[51:43] all right
[51:44] and according to the seven visions then
[51:46] he predicts so we the last one was the
[51:48] united states being smoldered over
[51:50] burning over and different things
[51:52] so look what he said this is the message
[51:55] uh
[51:56] contending
[51:57] condemnation by representation 1960 1113
[52:01] paragraph 35 all right
[52:04] now i see the united states as one
[52:06] smoldering burnt over place
[52:08] it will be the end
[52:11] then i've got it for instance i predict
[52:13] that this will take place now remember
[52:16] the lord
[52:18] that's what the lord showed now if i
[52:20] don't type i'm reading it exactly like
[52:22] he got it in there because it said now
[52:24] the lord
[52:25] in e and he said a word they couldn't
[52:27] make out
[52:28] so they put in e
[52:30] then he stuttered probably is what he's
[52:32] doing or something but he says that's
[52:33] what the lord showed now
[52:36] the lord showed seven visions right okay
[52:40] see everybody wants to bring it on down
[52:41] here and say the lord showed him it was
[52:43] 1977. now let's just read and see if the
[52:45] lord showed him it was 77 the lord
[52:48] showed him the vision we have no trouble
[52:49] with that right that's right nobody has
[52:51] any trouble god showed himself a
[52:52] division that's right
[52:54] all right
[52:55] so look what he said
[52:58] i predicted this
[53:00] that's what the lord showed me but i
[53:02] predict this will take place between
[53:04] before 1977.
[53:06] upon this prediction i base because of
[53:09] the unrushing slaughter that's coming
[53:11] now i faced that it was moving how long
[53:14] it'll take till this nation meets his
[53:16] place right
[53:18] so what does he say he predicts
[53:22] he predicted by 1977.
[53:25] they go to the next one
[53:27] this is a message conference 1960
[53:31] 1125 e7
[53:34] and he's telling the vision of those
[53:36] americans smoldering over
[53:39] and what
[53:40] and down beneath there i said not in the
[53:42] trance
[53:43] i want you not in the trance
[53:47] he's stipulating what's taking place
[53:50] but i predict remember this i guess this
[53:53] is
[53:54] take two i predict that these things
[53:56] will take place between now 1933 and
[53:59] 1977 which will give us
[54:01] 17 years more years if my prediction
[54:04] strikes right
[54:06] now there was seven things spoke of that
[54:09] would happen five of them have already
[54:11] happened there's two left to take place
[54:14] it'll be that way that's in the name of
[54:16] the lord it shall be that way
[54:19] did i miss reading
[54:21] where did i miss reading
[54:34] which will give us 16 more years
[54:39] let me really know it
[54:40] never need there i said not in the
[54:42] trance but i predict remember this i
[54:44] guess this is take two i predict that
[54:46] these things will take place between now
[54:49] 1933-1977 which will give us 17 more
[54:53] years if my for 16 more years if my
[54:56] prediction strikes right okay i said 17.
[54:58] all right correcting me that's fine okay
[55:01] go to the next one
[55:02] but watch all of these now everyone's
[55:04] got then right
[55:06] okay
[55:08] so now this is the ephesian church age
[55:10] which is church age book
[55:12] 19 no excuse me church age series 1960
[55:16] 1205 ephesians 8 paragraph 46. look what
[55:20] he said
[55:21] he's telling you which age when they
[55:23] started and where they end where they
[55:24] start where they end and all that coming
[55:27] through the dark ages and coming down
[55:29] and telling you the lutheran age and the
[55:31] ancient philadelphian aids western age
[55:33] and it lasted till 1906 and at 1906 the
[55:37] lady was seeing church age set in
[55:40] and i don't know where it'll end window
[55:43] end
[55:43] but i predict it'll be done by 1977. i
[55:47] predict
[55:48] not the lord told me but i predict it
[55:50] according to a vision
[55:53] that was showed me some years ago that
[55:56] five of those things has out of the
[55:58] seven has already
[56:00] taken place
[56:01] about
[56:02] all right
[56:04] now go to the next one
[56:08] that was
[56:10] this is the lady of sin
[56:12] this is the church age series books now
[56:14] when it's got a date on this
[56:16] it's the books individually right but it
[56:18] doesn't have it it'll be church edge
[56:19] book okay so in 1960 12 11 e
[56:23] we believe that the legacy in church
[56:25] started in
[56:27] 18 1906.
[56:29] i predict now remember predict
[56:31] especially you listening at the tape
[56:34] i don't say it will be but predict that
[56:37] it will end by 1977
[56:40] that the church will go completely into
[56:42] apostasy
[56:43] and she'll be ousted out of the mouth of
[56:45] god
[56:46] and the second coming or the rapture of
[56:48] christ might come any time
[56:50] now i could miss that a year
[56:54] now what
[56:55] i could miss it 20 years
[57:00] i could miss it a hundred years
[57:05] okay
[57:07] i don't know where it but i just predict
[57:10] that according to a vision he showed me
[57:13] and taking the time the way it's
[57:16] progressing
[57:19] i say it'll be some time between 1933
[57:22] and 77
[57:24] at at least this great nation is going
[57:26] to strike a war that's going to blow it
[57:29] to be it's see now that's pretty close
[57:32] it's awful close
[57:34] and i could be wrong i'm predicting
[57:36] everybody understand say amen if you do
[57:39] congregation says amen now
[57:42] all right so then
[57:44] predictions predictions
[57:47] okay
[57:50] i'm going to try to do these with two
[57:51] two parts here where somebody doesn't
[57:53] have it on tape
[57:57] all right so go ahead brother joe pull
[57:58] up number five
[58:01] and i'm gonna read some in between it
[58:04] off of this the churchx book
[58:07] to show you and i'll just sketch read it
[58:09] to give you the visions
[58:10] somebody on the tape somewhere out there
[58:12] might not know anything's ever happened
[58:13] on any point you know do it but look
[58:16] he says
[58:18] the legacy and age began around the turn
[58:20] of the 20th century
[58:22] perhaps 1906 how long it lies that a
[58:25] servant of god who has multiple who has
[58:27] had multitude of visions of which none
[58:29] have ever failed let me predict i did
[58:32] not say prophesy but predict that this
[58:34] age will end around 1977.
[58:37] if you will pardon a personal note here
[58:39] i base this prediction on seven
[58:42] continuous visions that came to me one
[58:44] sunday morning in 19 in june 1933. the
[58:48] lord jesus spoke and said the coming of
[58:49] the lord is drawing not all right and he
[58:51] said it's seven major things all right
[58:54] now if you'll keep on reading that's
[58:56] taken from
[58:57] page 321 of the church age book all
[59:00] right church age book 321 all right you
[59:04] keep on reading and it gives the seven
[59:06] things
[59:07] the seven things was first was the
[59:09] vision was that mussolini would invade
[59:11] ethiopia that's number one
[59:14] all right now i'm giving you off here so
[59:15] you can have this if you want
[59:17] the next vision told number two
[59:20] all right
[59:21] we're told that australia that an
[59:23] australian by the name of adolf hitler
[59:25] would rise up a dictator over germany
[59:27] number three it was a vision of the
[59:29] realm of political polit world politics
[59:33] it showed me there would be three great
[59:35] ism fantasism nazism communism the first
[59:38] two would be swallowed up in the third
[59:41] all right
[59:42] now number four
[59:44] the vision showed the great advances in
[59:46] science that would come to that would
[59:49] come after the second world war it
[59:51] headed up in a vision of a plastic
[59:53] bubble car
[59:54] you know and driving itself and things
[59:56] like that now there's not up here for
[59:57] you to read it off i'm giving you these
[59:59] coming down number five
[1:00:01] it had to do with a moral problem of her
[1:00:03] age
[1:00:04] certainly mostly around women it showed
[1:00:06] how women would do things and how they'd
[1:00:08] undress themselves that that was uh take
[1:00:10] men's clothing that's number five number
[1:00:13] six was a was the fact that they would
[1:00:16] then in the sixth vision there arose up
[1:00:19] in america a most beautiful but cruel
[1:00:21] woman
[1:00:22] she held the people in her complete
[1:00:24] power
[1:00:25] i believe that this was the rise of the
[1:00:27] roman catholic church though i knew it
[1:00:29] could possibly be a vision of some woman
[1:00:32] rising in great power in america due to
[1:00:34] a popular vote by the women so we're
[1:00:36] close to all of that right right
[1:00:38] we've done had a couple of them around
[1:00:39] running around pretty close right and
[1:00:42] the catholic church is certainly here
[1:00:43] all right the last one or the seventh
[1:00:45] vision is when he heard a most horrible
[1:00:48] explosion and he turned and looked and
[1:00:50] when he did he saw america rolled over
[1:00:52] okay go ahead with the next one now
[1:00:54] number six for the job that was in
[1:00:56] between these five and six
[1:00:58] all right this is 322 church age book
[1:01:01] based on the the seven visions along
[1:01:03] with the rapid change which
[1:01:05] have swept changes which have swept the
[1:01:07] world in the last 50 years i predict i
[1:01:10] do not prophesy that these visions will
[1:01:13] have all come to pass by 1977
[1:01:16] and though many may feel that this is an
[1:01:19] irresponsible statement in view of the
[1:01:21] fact that jesus said that no man north
[1:01:23] the day nor the hour i still maintain
[1:01:26] this prediction after 30 years because
[1:01:30] jesus did say
[1:01:32] did not say
[1:01:33] no man could know the year
[1:01:36] month or week in which his coming was to
[1:01:38] be completed so i repeat i sincerely
[1:01:41] believe and maintain as a private
[1:01:42] student of the word along with divine
[1:01:44] inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate
[1:01:47] the world system
[1:01:48] systems and usher in the millennium now
[1:01:51] he was looking for that right
[1:01:54] well wouldn't we
[1:01:56] aren't we looking for it now
[1:01:58] all right
[1:02:00] but what will it do
[1:02:04] now these will be out of the city which
[1:02:07] is dangerous number seven
[1:02:09] but now remember we've given you where
[1:02:11] he says prediction i do not prophesy i
[1:02:14] predict i predict i predict i do not
[1:02:16] prophesy the lord didn't tell me this i
[1:02:19] predict
[1:02:22] i could miss it
[1:02:24] what 20 years i could miss it a hundred
[1:02:26] years
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:30] now we don't read them because we don't
[1:02:32] want to hear that
[1:02:35] we just want to have something to happen
[1:02:37] you know look look at this one
[1:02:40] 199 of the
[1:02:43] 70th week of daniel brings to 1961-806
[1:02:50] and you're coming down about a car and a
[1:02:51] model forward he bought and everything
[1:02:53] he had just bought his model ford not a
[1:02:56] 33 model ford
[1:02:58] what did it look like and i went over
[1:02:59] there in the masonic temple were some of
[1:03:01] your old timers and i remember it's
[1:03:03] wrote down on an old paper at home
[1:03:06] it's already in print and went out
[1:03:08] around the world see that was in 1933
[1:03:11] and i predict that there would be some
[1:03:13] great tragedy happen to this united
[1:03:15] states before or by the year
[1:03:18] of 1977
[1:03:20] and he remembers me saying that look at
[1:03:22] the hands so a lot of people have their
[1:03:24] hands up all right go on to the next one
[1:03:33] this is paragraph
[1:03:35] 2 12 of the 70th week of daniel 61 806.
[1:03:41] here comes around and shows and then i
[1:03:44] predict
[1:03:45] i never said the lord told me that
[1:03:47] but standing that morning in the church
[1:03:50] i said
[1:03:51] the way progress i go back to one end
[1:03:54] and what i got back to one end of the
[1:03:56] wall and i've heard this quote by many
[1:03:58] people and there it is but around them
[1:04:00] and saying he done that
[1:04:03] he done this i got back to one end of
[1:04:04] the wall and run to the other end of the
[1:04:06] wall and i said the way progress is
[1:04:09] going on i'll predict at the time i
[1:04:11] don't know why i'm saying it but i
[1:04:14] predict that that'll all happen between
[1:04:16] right now 1933 and 1977
[1:04:19] and not knowing it god knows my heart i
[1:04:21] never know it until yesterday that 1977
[1:04:24] as a jubilee exactly the same amount of
[1:04:27] time run out
[1:04:29] time running out that he gave with
[1:04:32] israel and everything at the end so
[1:04:34] we're at and here we are at the end of
[1:04:36] the age at the coming of the 70th week
[1:04:38] all right
[1:04:39] now he he's made these statements i'm
[1:04:41] giving them to you that he's making
[1:04:43] statement and i believe he believed it
[1:04:46] but i'm trying to get you to see predict
[1:04:49] predict i don't prophesy i don't say the
[1:04:51] lord told me this
[1:04:55] and if you and i have been there we said
[1:04:56] sci-fi
[1:04:59] no i'd have been strong
[1:05:03] okay what's number nine
[1:05:10] so we'll just read this
[1:05:11] now i do not want anyone this is 1961
[1:05:14] 806 the 70th week of daniel paragraph
[1:05:16] 226.
[1:05:18] now i do not want anyone to go away
[1:05:19] misunderstanding this tape's still
[1:05:21] playing
[1:05:23] i don't want anybody anyone to
[1:05:24] misunderstand it
[1:05:26] don't misunderstand me now and say
[1:05:28] brother brown said jesus will come in
[1:05:30] 1977.
[1:05:32] i never said no such a thing jesus may
[1:05:35] come today but i have predicted that
[1:05:38] between 33 and 77 something would take
[1:05:41] place that these things that i seen come
[1:05:43] to pass and division would take place
[1:05:46] and five of them had already took place
[1:05:48] the way he says now don't say that the
[1:05:50] lord said
[1:05:52] but everybody says it stuff saith the
[1:05:54] lord
[1:05:55] that's what they said back there
[1:05:57] of course they're all mouth shut now
[1:05:58] right
[1:06:00] you know so i have people run out and
[1:06:01] finally their tongue runs out on the
[1:06:03] floor and they get stomped a dozen times
[1:06:05] you know they don't say too much after
[1:06:06] that
[1:06:07] i don't mean that's a joke
[1:06:11] it's true
[1:06:13] see people can they'll go out though and
[1:06:15] what what bothers me you know what
[1:06:17] bothers me more than anything in the
[1:06:18] world because i've been out there and
[1:06:19] heard them
[1:06:21] when i was in the philippines those
[1:06:23] brothers said we couldn't argue with the
[1:06:24] two-soul doctrine because we didn't have
[1:06:26] no quote from brother brown
[1:06:30] said we were at the mercy of the people
[1:06:31] that brought it over here
[1:06:35] that's why my desire is to try to get
[1:06:37] the message out
[1:06:40] used to build churches and do all kinds
[1:06:42] of things now my desire is to try to get
[1:06:44] the message out
[1:06:47] if it's printing books and whatever it's
[1:06:49] doing get the message out at least they
[1:06:51] can argue with them
[1:06:54] what if what if you didn't have the
[1:06:56] books that's right i remember brought
[1:06:57] him up saying one time he said that they
[1:06:59] were sitting at the tabernacle and said
[1:07:00] brother brown said see there something
[1:07:02] to this degree something that see look
[1:07:04] at adam and eve was
[1:07:06] gone and thrown out of the garden
[1:07:09] and he said we went months before we
[1:07:11] heard another tape
[1:07:13] around said there went adam and eve out
[1:07:15] of the garden and god made a way
[1:07:18] so you're at the mercy of what the
[1:07:19] people bring that's right
[1:07:23] but you see nobody wants to because you
[1:07:26] know they don't want you to be able to
[1:07:28] quote brother brown
[1:07:31] they want you to go with their quote
[1:07:35] of what they think
[1:07:38] when brother stand up in a church and i
[1:07:40] mean he had preached it over and over
[1:07:42] and i mean stood right there in a church
[1:07:44] and pointed right out to people said
[1:07:46] the women will be saved in childbearing
[1:07:50] that's no joke
[1:07:52] after the service went over
[1:07:54] i asked him a simple question
[1:08:00] i said brother would you mind quoting
[1:08:01] the rest of that paragraph
[1:08:03] the rest of that sentence that prophet
[1:08:05] said were you quoting this morning
[1:08:08] what do you mean i said what the prophet
[1:08:09] said you say to childbearing i said read
[1:08:12] the rest of it
[1:08:13] the scripture said if she continue in
[1:08:16] the faith
[1:08:20] see he left
[1:08:21] women having babies well what about
[1:08:22] women they can't have no babies
[1:08:26] where are they going to be
[1:08:29] let's see
[1:08:30] yeah
[1:08:32] always somebody like an 83 year old man
[1:08:34] at the south carolina said
[1:08:35] you shouldn't have sex with your wife
[1:08:37] anymore
[1:08:39] he's 83 years old that's right
[1:08:42] you would have said that when he's 18
[1:08:44] but you know
[1:08:45] that's right
[1:08:46] i know that's being sarcastic
[1:08:49] the truth is true
[1:08:52] am i right
[1:08:54] but now what took place
[1:08:55] he said i never said no such time right
[1:08:59] i never said no such thing that the lord
[1:09:00] jesus is coming and said to himself oh
[1:09:03] brother there no he didn't he said he
[1:09:05] come and said it's 63.
[1:09:07] no he didn't
[1:09:14] but you're not reading what he says
[1:09:17] what took place in 1977
[1:09:22] the greatest
[1:09:24] opportunity
[1:09:26] for the bride of jesus christ
[1:09:30] started taking place in 1977
[1:09:35] when people got away from predictions
[1:09:37] and thoughts and ideas and began to
[1:09:39] settle down
[1:09:41] and see what the prophet was saying
[1:09:46] did you notice that we read there
[1:09:49] right around said in 1977
[1:09:52] that we would have exactly the same
[1:09:54] amount of time that the jews had
[1:09:57] in that coincidental he said 1977
[1:10:02] we would have the same amount of time
[1:10:07] a lot took place in 1977.
[1:10:12] that's when this message come alive to
[1:10:14] me
[1:10:16] i think god had already preached that we
[1:10:18] could pass them
[1:10:20] but i wouldn't want it to do that i
[1:10:21] don't want it today
[1:10:23] i'm standing here telling you we could
[1:10:24] go to the year five thousand it wouldn't
[1:10:26] break around the message nor the bible
[1:10:29] i'll stand all night we can talk on that
[1:10:30] if you want to
[1:10:33] i'll show you in a minute why because in
[1:10:35] 1977
[1:10:36] we entered a 50.
[1:10:44] and there is no limitation to the 50.
[1:10:50] you've gone past it
[1:10:55] he said yeah but i
[1:10:56] thought is why people don't want to know
[1:10:59] what somebody has to say they can say it
[1:11:01] right and show the script
[1:11:05] to see what the prophet really said
[1:11:08] look what he said
[1:11:12] he said i never knew
[1:11:14] i never said no such time
[1:11:18] look at the next one
[1:11:22] this is the it's a pair of 196
[1:11:26] through 198
[1:11:28] of the 70th week of daniel priest
[1:11:30] 1961-806
[1:11:33] now count the time that we have exactly
[1:11:36] listen
[1:11:37] 17 years left and we will have the
[1:11:40] science span of time given to us as god
[1:11:43] dealing with
[1:11:44] us in the power of the holy spirit since
[1:11:46] 80 33 until 1977
[1:11:50] the science span of time of 1954 years
[1:11:53] god deals with us the same as he did
[1:11:55] with the jews see how about that now
[1:11:57] before any smart epic starts crowing out
[1:12:00] there
[1:12:02] i can mathematically count can't you if
[1:12:04] you take 33 off of 77 you don't have
[1:12:07] 1954
[1:12:09] you have 1944.
[1:12:12] that's in case somebody comes up you
[1:12:14] know out there and say well you don't
[1:12:15] know i know that
[1:12:17] but i will tell you one thing since 6 30
[1:12:20] 80 33 and 77 our calendars have been
[1:12:23] changed three times
[1:12:27] easily can take up ten years and the
[1:12:29] calendar changes
[1:12:31] so don't crow
[1:12:33] i preached this in 1974.
[1:12:38] showed with the calendars
[1:12:41] the gregorian calendar one of them when
[1:12:43] it came in it only was 200 something
[1:12:45] days in one year
[1:12:46] when they're throwing the calendar back
[1:12:48] to the system making it line up with the
[1:12:49] stars
[1:12:53] then we're under what the gregorian
[1:12:59] but you see that's where people will say
[1:13:01] we now we know what's the truth
[1:13:04] mr brown said we got the same amount of
[1:13:06] time
[1:13:07] how about that now mark down in your
[1:13:08] book a little scripture
[1:13:12] now we should mark down in your little
[1:13:14] book your bible or turn over there and
[1:13:17] read it
[1:13:21] all right
[1:13:24] leviticus beginning with the eighth
[1:13:26] verse
[1:13:28] so let's just read it well
[1:13:31] i may be late i got 20 more minutes
[1:13:34] if i can find leviticus mary
[1:13:41] okay leviticus 25 you don't have to pull
[1:13:44] this up joel we'll read it from the
[1:13:45] scripture
[1:13:47] leviticus 24 25
[1:13:52] beginning with the eighth verse
[1:13:56] all right let's begin with the verse
[1:13:58] and lord speak unto moses and not
[1:13:59] signing and saying speaking to the
[1:14:00] children of israel and say unto them
[1:14:02] when you come into the land which i give
[1:14:04] you then shall the land keep a sabbath
[1:14:06] unto the lord
[1:14:07] six years shalt thy soul ye i feel
[1:14:10] in six years
[1:14:11] i shall prune thy vineyard and give her
[1:14:13] into the fruit thereof but in the
[1:14:15] seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest
[1:14:18] unto the land all right everybody
[1:14:19] understand that in the old testament
[1:14:21] that was the sabbath the rest
[1:14:23] six days you rested to seven
[1:14:25] six years you were you rested the seven
[1:14:28] all right watch what's happening
[1:14:29] but in the seventh year she'll be a
[1:14:31] sabbath arrest unto the lamb a sabbath
[1:14:34] for for the lord
[1:14:36] thy shalt neither soul thy field nor
[1:14:38] prune thy vineyard that which growth of
[1:14:40] its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
[1:14:42] not reap now notice not reap
[1:14:44] you could go by and gather a little bit
[1:14:46] and eat but you couldn't reap it all
[1:14:47] right because there was nothing to keep
[1:14:48] over neither gather the grace of the
[1:14:50] vine undress for it is a year of rest
[1:14:52] unto the lamb
[1:14:53] and the sabbath of the lamb shall be
[1:14:55] meat to you for thee and for thy servant
[1:14:57] for what i made and for the hard servant
[1:14:59] and higher servant and for thy stranger
[1:15:02] that sojourned with thee and for that
[1:15:04] cattle and all like that because i could
[1:15:05] go out and just eat
[1:15:07] all right
[1:15:08] now he says leviticus 25 8
[1:15:12] thou shalt number seven sabbath of years
[1:15:14] unto thee
[1:15:16] seven times seven years
[1:15:20] now what's seven times
[1:15:22] seven oh 49
[1:15:27] we got it
[1:15:30] now we got it
[1:15:35] see in the old testament it takes a long
[1:15:36] time to show this but be glad to do it
[1:15:40] they had a sabbath there were seven
[1:15:41] years
[1:15:45] you went into bondage
[1:15:48] you could stay in bondage only seven
[1:15:49] years
[1:15:52] now that has to be explained because
[1:15:53] people don't go back and read
[1:15:57] it is not
[1:15:58] to ever slave that was bought
[1:16:03] that is not what it's talking about i'll
[1:16:05] give it to you be glad to give it to you
[1:16:08] uh exodus 21 1-6 a hebrew
[1:16:13] buys a hebrew
[1:16:16] this is not talking about natural
[1:16:18] slavery
[1:16:20] in natural slavery if you bought a slave
[1:16:24] that was not a hebrew
[1:16:26] he did not go free
[1:16:32] because that's the way it is you're not
[1:16:33] born again
[1:16:34] right
[1:16:35] right you're lost
[1:16:38] he's not an israelite
[1:16:40] he's not a hebrew
[1:16:44] it's not all slavery it wasn't that you
[1:16:46] just it's seven years all slaves went
[1:16:49] home no
[1:16:50] slaves that were bought and not a hebrew
[1:16:54] not of their own kindred
[1:16:58] he remained a slave
[1:17:01] because that's where people that today
[1:17:02] lost
[1:17:05] with no hope
[1:17:07] why because they rejected the gospel
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:10] but look and i shall number seven
[1:17:12] sabbaths and years into these seven
[1:17:13] times seven years and the space of the
[1:17:15] seven sabbath years
[1:17:17] shall be unto the forty and nine years
[1:17:21] now
[1:17:23] to explain in a hurry
[1:17:26] a hebrew bought a hebrew you got into
[1:17:29] trouble you needed to go down you worked
[1:17:31] for your neighbor
[1:17:34] and you worked for me for seven years
[1:17:36] six years the seventh year you went home
[1:17:38] free
[1:17:40] right
[1:17:42] that was the law even you didn't send
[1:17:45] him home empty-handed now i'm sure this
[1:17:47] is throughout the scripture you didn't
[1:17:48] send him home empty-handed
[1:17:50] you had to give him provisions to get
[1:17:52] him started again
[1:17:55] because he's a brother he's a hebrew
[1:17:57] it's not slavery
[1:17:59] that's right it's a hebrew by the hebrew
[1:18:04] if you're going into language to your
[1:18:05] neighbor
[1:18:10] and you can only keep the man for six
[1:18:12] years but now i'm quoting scriptures
[1:18:13] whether you believe it or not
[1:18:15] and the bible says if a man went into
[1:18:17] bondage with a wife he could come out
[1:18:18] with a wife
[1:18:19] but if he went into bondage and his
[1:18:21] master gave him a wife
[1:18:24] his wife didn't go out
[1:18:26] that's the scripture
[1:18:28] why stayed with a man because
[1:18:31] she belonged to that not to him
[1:18:34] but there was a wonderful thing happened
[1:18:36] because that would go seven sevens is
[1:18:38] 49.
[1:18:42] a gospel trumpet would sound on the 49th
[1:18:44] year
[1:18:50] in the rest
[1:18:52] that you'd go free on the 50.
[1:18:56] now i'm quoting scriptures people don't
[1:18:58] believe it go back and read your bible
[1:18:59] get in and read it read leviticus i mean
[1:19:02] read exodus
[1:19:03] uh read
[1:19:07] deuteronomy 15
[1:19:09] exodus 21 read these scriptures
[1:19:12] all right well let's just read right
[1:19:13] over here because that's what he's given
[1:19:15] that's what number seven seven some
[1:19:16] years under these seven times seven
[1:19:18] years and the space of the seven
[1:19:19] thousands of years it'll be under the 49
[1:19:21] years
[1:19:22] then shalt that
[1:19:24] then shall thou cause the trumpet of the
[1:19:27] jubilee
[1:19:28] now this is in the seventh
[1:19:31] right when it comes to the 49
[1:19:35] there were seven sabbaths
[1:19:37] and there's seven
[1:19:39] and the seven sabbaths of the 49
[1:19:41] represents the seven church ages
[1:19:43] all right
[1:19:46] there was no hopes of a rapture in
[1:19:49] chapter in in the first church age
[1:19:51] second third fourth field six
[1:19:54] but there was a freedom
[1:19:57] a rest in christ heaven
[1:20:00] but not a rapture
[1:20:02] in the seventh year you got a very
[1:20:04] special thing that would take place
[1:20:06] because through the land went
[1:20:09] a person
[1:20:10] to declare
[1:20:11] that next year everything goes free
[1:20:14] right
[1:20:15] now remember what i said if you read
[1:20:16] those scriptures i give you deuteronomy
[1:20:18] 15 or exodus 21 and you'll find it in
[1:20:20] ours explaining
[1:20:23] if you go into bondage with a wife you
[1:20:24] come out with a wife under your sevens
[1:20:28] but if your master gave you a wife the
[1:20:30] wife had to stay he went out free that's
[1:20:32] bible
[1:20:33] man
[1:20:34] it's also in there that he you couldn't
[1:20:36] send him home without having him
[1:20:38] because he's your brother
[1:20:41] all right now let's read verse nine and
[1:20:43] that's your cause the trumpet of the
[1:20:45] jubilee to sound when
[1:20:50] when is the trumpet as you believe a
[1:20:51] sound
[1:20:53] on the 10th day
[1:20:56] october the 10th
[1:20:59] yep
[1:21:00] because it don't start in january you
[1:21:01] know come on the bible don't start the
[1:21:03] jews in january starts in april right
[1:21:07] come on
[1:21:10] the seventh month in the tenth day
[1:21:12] uh
[1:21:13] in the day of atonement
[1:21:19] listen let's see where it happened
[1:21:24] let's see it's the day of the atonement
[1:21:27] in other words the tenth day of the
[1:21:28] seventh month is the day of the
[1:21:30] atonement
[1:21:31] leviticus 23 27 read it
[1:21:34] i told you
[1:21:36] can you make the trumpet sound
[1:21:38] throughout all of your land now watch
[1:21:41] verse 10 and you shall hallow the 50th
[1:21:45] year and proclaim liberty throughout all
[1:21:48] the land unto all the inhabitants
[1:21:50] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you
[1:21:53] and you shall return every man unto his
[1:21:55] possession and you shall reach a prayer
[1:21:57] turn every man unto his family
[1:22:00] now everything goes free under the 50
[1:22:02] watch it right
[1:22:04] because it's only way to type a rapture
[1:22:06] you can't top it with a bondage it'll
[1:22:08] wipe it too master gives you a wife that
[1:22:11] won't talk you got to get his family
[1:22:12] free that's right you got to give them
[1:22:14] an opportunity
[1:22:15] for a jubilee show the 50th year be unto
[1:22:17] you you shall not sow neither rick that
[1:22:19] which growth of itself in it nor
[1:22:21] together the grapes in it of a vineyard
[1:22:23] for it is the jubilee it shall be holy
[1:22:26] unto you you shall eat the increase
[1:22:27] thereof out of the field in the year of
[1:22:30] this jubilee
[1:22:32] you shall return every man unto his
[1:22:34] possession
[1:22:35] if thy sell all unto thy neighbor are
[1:22:37] vice out of thy neighbor's hand you
[1:22:39] shall not oppress one another
[1:22:42] according to the number of years after
[1:22:43] the jubilee thou shalt by of thy
[1:22:45] neighbor and according to the number of
[1:22:47] years of the fruits
[1:22:49] he shall sell unto them and according to
[1:22:51] the multitude of the years thou shalt
[1:22:53] increase the price i shall increase the
[1:22:55] price thereof and according to the
[1:22:58] fewness of years i shall
[1:23:00] diminish the price of it
[1:23:03] for according to the number of the years
[1:23:05] or the fruits that he sell unto thee in
[1:23:09] other words you can't raise the price
[1:23:12] because you can't raise the price of
[1:23:14] salvation
[1:23:16] come on we could be here price 12
[1:23:17] o'clock but i'm trying not to be because
[1:23:19] 1977 let's see what the prophet said go
[1:23:22] ahead brother with the number 10 now
[1:23:24] that we had up
[1:23:27] that we were reading
[1:23:28] look what he said
[1:23:30] go to leviticus 25 8 and begin god
[1:23:33] called the jubilee of our 49th year the
[1:23:35] 50th year was the jubilee we know that
[1:23:37] we understand that from the first
[1:23:39] jubilee
[1:23:41] first jubilee
[1:23:44] of leviticus 25 8
[1:23:47] in 1977
[1:23:49] will be the 70th jubilee
[1:23:56] making exactly 3 430 years
[1:24:01] jubilee means that going up the release
[1:24:05] multiply 50 times 70 what is it come on
[1:24:07] someone give me a math definition
[1:24:09] what is 70 times 50
[1:24:11] 3500 won't work you're off
[1:24:14] multiply 49-70 and see what you got
[1:24:20] 3430
[1:24:22] exactly the prophet gave it right
[1:24:25] he knows exactly what he's talking about
[1:24:27] you want some some real truth there's
[1:24:29] truth he could even figure it
[1:24:31] mathematically
[1:24:33] that by 1977 would have about the same
[1:24:35] amount of time did you get that god had
[1:24:37] dealt with this exactly the same amount
[1:24:38] of time that he dealt with the jews from
[1:24:40] the time he gave abraham the promise
[1:24:42] until the rejecting of the messiah in
[1:24:44] a.d 33 with 1954 years and now we have
[1:24:48] 17 years left we had about 19 30
[1:24:52] 19 30 something years we've got 17 years
[1:24:55] left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee
[1:24:59] since the beginning of jubilees
[1:25:01] and what will it be oh brother watch
[1:25:04] close now don't miss it it'll be the
[1:25:06] jubilee
[1:25:09] watching
[1:25:11] of the going up
[1:25:13] of the gentile bride
[1:25:15] and the return of christ to the jews
[1:25:18] when they go out of bondage
[1:25:21] there's three and a half years between
[1:25:23] the fact of
[1:25:24] us going in a rapture and the jews going
[1:25:26] out of bondage
[1:25:29] come on
[1:25:31] get in your bible
[1:25:34] oh don't you see
[1:25:36] from all the world and they've gathered
[1:25:38] there for that day oh my see where we're
[1:25:40] at we don't know but what time it might
[1:25:42] happen we're at the end time
[1:25:46] we don't know what time it might happen
[1:25:49] but we're at the end time
[1:25:52] number eleven
[1:25:55] and the old testament in the bible said
[1:25:56] this is taken from uh 56 7 15 the mark
[1:26:00] of the beast
[1:26:01] um
[1:26:02] e21
[1:26:03] and the old testament the bible said
[1:26:05] that there was to be a 50 year jubilee
[1:26:08] that was seven times seven years
[1:26:12] and in the 49th year
[1:26:18] that it was to be made ready for the
[1:26:21] 50th year
[1:26:22] was the jubilee
[1:26:26] 50 means jubilee it was 50 is god's
[1:26:30] jubilee number the word pentecost means
[1:26:32] 50. it was the outpouring of the holy
[1:26:34] spirit at the end of the 50 days it was
[1:26:37] also the end of the 50th year jesus
[1:26:40] comes to foreshadow it and run into
[1:26:41] people to come in the year of jubilee
[1:26:44] he said brother dale what are you
[1:26:46] getting at 50 million pentecost means 50
[1:26:48] without pouring in the holy spirit on
[1:26:50] today so we come down to the bottom get
[1:26:51] hurt or it was given forth the warning
[1:26:54] of the coming forth of the great gusher
[1:26:56] of pentecost to set it liberty everyone
[1:26:58] that was slaves to sin and bondage
[1:27:01] that's what jubilee is is to set you
[1:27:03] free
[1:27:05] what are you getting now
[1:27:08] she was looking at 77 as a year instead
[1:27:10] of a jubilee
[1:27:12] 1977 your prophet said it read them
[1:27:15] you out there on the internet you've
[1:27:16] read it off the screen you may never
[1:27:18] seen these before but there they are you
[1:27:20] you go bring them if they're not in the
[1:27:21] book come and show me
[1:27:25] if you can show me anything else he said
[1:27:27] about 1977 contrary to what i'm showing
[1:27:30] tonight i'd love to see it
[1:27:32] but i've been studying it now for 40
[1:27:34] something years
[1:27:37] 1977 you're concerned with a year
[1:27:39] instead of concerned with a jubilee
[1:27:47] with these 70th jubilee
[1:27:51] what's the next jubilee after it it's a
[1:27:53] 49
[1:27:54] 49 would come to a 50.
[1:27:58] 1977 was the 70th jubilee
[1:28:01] since the beginning of jubilees that's
[1:28:03] what he said
[1:28:04] what happened in 1977
[1:28:07] the bride that has stayed with the
[1:28:08] message has been able to
[1:28:10] do what he said be the growing up of the
[1:28:13] gentile bride
[1:28:15] the bride started going up not
[1:28:16] physically now don't get me carnal
[1:28:19] bride started elevating throughout the
[1:28:21] message
[1:28:23] in 77 you begin to become more
[1:28:26] interested to the bride people real
[1:28:28] bright people that was interested in
[1:28:30] waiting for the day right
[1:28:33] because that's where it became with me
[1:28:34] and then in 1979 i preached the seals
[1:28:37] for the first time
[1:28:40] i wasn't i saw it wasn't complete or
[1:28:41] finished and then i waited lady too to
[1:28:44] preach it again and i had never preached
[1:28:45] on it again
[1:28:47] because i finished
[1:28:49] i preached what i saw what he's talking
[1:28:51] about right lost one of the greatest
[1:28:52] friends i've ever had used to eat my
[1:28:54] home just off and on
[1:28:56] could have called me to give me he's
[1:28:58] offered me about his car to go to jeff
[1:29:00] one time because mine was a thing flew
[1:29:02] and hit the gas tank he was a great
[1:29:04] brother
[1:29:05] but because i said i had a revelation
[1:29:09] he said he didn't have one he said
[1:29:10] brother brown had the revelation
[1:29:14] well he said this is my revelation
[1:29:16] brother branham had the revelation
[1:29:18] sounded like he said the same thing i
[1:29:20] did to me now
[1:29:22] i know i'm carnal but it sounds like he
[1:29:24] said he had a revelation and i said i
[1:29:26] had one
[1:29:28] 1977 was the 70th jubilee
[1:29:31] an opportunity but it's 70 times 49.
[1:29:36] the 50th see then you could add another
[1:29:38] 50 in 1977 and where would you be
[1:29:45] i want your mathematician to count it up
[1:29:47] if you added 50 more to that which you
[1:29:48] could very easily because there's no
[1:29:50] limit with the 50.
[1:29:54] you'd wind up in 2027.
[1:29:57] 26.
[1:30:03] and if you're in a jubilee what are you
[1:30:04] worried about when it's going to be it's
[1:30:06] 5 000. praise the lord
[1:30:09] there's still plenty of privilege right
[1:30:11] i ain't run out yet
[1:30:14] never had any problems with it
[1:30:17] but what would happen now
[1:30:20] let's see what did we finish up on
[1:30:22] did we finish up on 11
[1:30:25] well
[1:30:26] okay
[1:30:28] let's read 12
[1:30:29] of our women please for just a few
[1:30:31] minutes now remember in the old
[1:30:32] testament with man lost his inheritance
[1:30:34] and a squatter come on his lane he could
[1:30:36] not hold it any longer for annihilation
[1:30:38] from the owner until 50 years
[1:30:41] after 50 years the year of jubilee came
[1:30:44] by in the year of jubilee
[1:30:47] when the year of jubilee come along and
[1:30:49] everything went back to its original
[1:30:50] beginning again all slaves and went back
[1:30:53] to the original beginning if a man was
[1:30:55] hoeing in the field and the trumpet
[1:30:57] sounded he heard it he threw down the ho
[1:30:59] and said and say i'm no more a slave i
[1:31:03] go back home to my family everything was
[1:31:05] given back it says if a squatter was on
[1:31:07] the ground he had to get off the ground
[1:31:10] that's all he got off the ground because
[1:31:12] why the real owner was coming back
[1:31:15] he had to give away hallelujah one of
[1:31:17] these days the kingdom of this world
[1:31:20] will fall and the legal owners will come
[1:31:22] in one of these days amen
[1:31:25] all right
[1:31:26] look at the next and that's it
[1:31:28] uh so we get on up into the seal to see
[1:31:31] what he says about these two believe
[1:31:33] so this is second seal 1963
[1:31:36] 13 paragraph 2 14.
[1:31:39] in the old testament when a man had been
[1:31:41] told of slavery now come a year of
[1:31:42] jubilee every 50 years
[1:31:44] 49
[1:31:46] ninth year and then the year of jubilee
[1:31:48] and when a slave heard this and he
[1:31:50] wanted to go free there
[1:31:52] there isn't nothing that can keep him
[1:31:54] from going free he can throw down his
[1:31:56] home and say so long and go back home
[1:31:58] the trumpet sounded that's right but if
[1:32:00] he didn't want to go and he's satisfied
[1:32:02] with his bloody master
[1:32:04] then he's taken into the temple now
[1:32:06] watch what he says here about this
[1:32:09] and they take an awful and you know what
[1:32:11] an all is and they pierced his ear and
[1:32:14] they put a hole in his ear now come on
[1:32:16] you sisters into your earbuds and all
[1:32:17] the things you know look what it means
[1:32:20] it's a mark that he can never go back
[1:32:24] put them in your rooms in there
[1:32:27] it's a mark you'll never hear the gospel
[1:32:29] unless god i know everything the prophet
[1:32:31] says
[1:32:33] that's all i got to say
[1:32:35] it's a mark that he can never go back is
[1:32:37] that right he has to serve his master
[1:32:39] for all the time i don't care how many
[1:32:41] more times the jubilee sounds
[1:32:45] whatever happens he's absolutely has
[1:32:48] sold out his birthright
[1:32:50] of being free
[1:32:51] what
[1:32:53] and when a man turns down the gospel
[1:32:55] truth satan marks him word at his ear he
[1:32:58] defends him so he can't hear the truth
[1:33:00] no more amen
[1:33:04] now how long can i stop there and talk
[1:33:05] about the people of this message that
[1:33:07] they've been blinded by false shepherds
[1:33:08] your prophet said
[1:33:10] right and they can't hear the truth
[1:33:13] they're afraid to hear the truth
[1:33:18] come on folks that's why we're on
[1:33:19] internet because i travel around and
[1:33:21] people say let me have your tapes i said
[1:33:22] get your password okay and i'm giving to
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:25] i can't get my pastor okay if they say
[1:33:32] but they can travel the country can't
[1:33:33] you yeah come on i've been around too
[1:33:36] long i haven't been around and heard the
[1:33:37] doctrines years ago there was one years
[1:33:39] ago that if you went anywhere besides
[1:33:42] listening to me
[1:33:44] you was committed an adulterer against
[1:33:45] me and had another husband
[1:33:48] we've been through all of them the only
[1:33:50] problem i had then was why was my
[1:33:52] husband running around
[1:33:55] because he could go to other churches
[1:33:57] and preach
[1:33:58] come on
[1:33:59] that ain't comical
[1:34:03] i didn't mean it then i don't mean it
[1:34:04] now that ain't comical
[1:34:07] he could go preach around the country
[1:34:08] but if i went anywhere else i was
[1:34:10] committing spiritual adultery
[1:34:14] that's binding you by
[1:34:16] fear that's right
[1:34:18] i am only the pastor to the people here
[1:34:21] that makes me their pastor
[1:34:24] the rest of you paying the bills
[1:34:28] i'm saying i've said it long enough
[1:34:30] you're paying the bills hey keep coming
[1:34:33] we need your money pay the bills
[1:34:36] i'm only the pastor of those that have
[1:34:38] made me their passion that's right
[1:34:39] that's right
[1:34:42] come on that's right
[1:34:44] that's what he said
[1:34:45] he didn't see him so he can't hear the
[1:34:47] truth no more in his things he stays
[1:34:50] with the group
[1:34:51] that he is with
[1:34:53] and if he won't hear the truth no you
[1:34:55] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:34:56] make you free the truth makes fruit
[1:34:58] god marks he is when they come
[1:35:02] god marks his by vindicating his
[1:35:04] promised word through them that's
[1:35:06] exactly saint john 14 12. and another
[1:35:09] thing if you want to put down mark
[1:35:12] 16 jesus said these signs
[1:35:15] you follow thee all right
[1:35:25] let's just
[1:35:26] end as i say
[1:35:29] if you can find any words brother i'm
[1:35:31] explaining 1977 any other way than what
[1:35:33] i read to you tonight i want to hear it
[1:35:40] see i'm asking you for it through your
[1:35:42] duty mine
[1:35:44] and you won't offend me if you come and
[1:35:45] tell me
[1:35:46] i'll be tickled today
[1:35:50] but you see i preached this in 1974
[1:35:54] that jubilee
[1:36:01] i thought we believed over in
[1:36:03] thessalonians that the bible said the
[1:36:05] lord shall descend from heaven with a
[1:36:06] shout right
[1:36:08] you know what the word shout means you
[1:36:09] ever looked that up
[1:36:13] come on you ever looked up shout at me
[1:36:15] jubilee
[1:36:19] go back there when joshua was telling
[1:36:22] the people walk around the walls
[1:36:26] six days remember they went one day at a
[1:36:29] time
[1:36:30] no freedom right no walls went down
[1:36:34] no church age had a freedom of a rapture
[1:36:38] right
[1:36:39] when they come to the last day the
[1:36:41] seventh
[1:36:43] joshua said go around it seven times
[1:36:47] right read your bible
[1:36:49] seven times on the seventh is 49.
[1:36:55] and he said when you do turn around and
[1:36:57] face the wall
[1:36:59] and say you shout look that word up
[1:37:06] when they shouted what joshua shouted
[1:37:09] joshua wasn't standing at the walls
[1:37:10] right he'd give him their order stand up
[1:37:12] on the hill watching them
[1:37:16] he doesn't give his orders brother
[1:37:18] doesn't give us the order
[1:37:20] he doesn't brought us the word that's
[1:37:22] right time for the ministry to shout to
[1:37:24] shout don't look that word up shout
[1:37:26] there and see if it don't mean jubilee
[1:37:30] now in the bible i'll give you another
[1:37:32] key
[1:37:32] yes you missed this in the bible it's
[1:37:35] spelled j-u-b-i-l-e
[1:37:42] now so don't go in the bible start
[1:37:43] looking for j-u-b-i-l-e-e
[1:37:46] it's not
[1:37:50] i'm just giving you that so people
[1:37:51] wouldn't know where you you stand on it
[1:37:54] but it's the word jubilee
[1:37:57] it means shout joyous festivity it means
[1:38:00] that we're ready we're going out of here
[1:38:03] we've got the message we're in the
[1:38:04] message the message what's going to take
[1:38:06] us out here
[1:38:07] when the people shouted what what joshua
[1:38:09] shouted to walter jericho fell down
[1:38:13] right right
[1:38:14] man but he walked around seven times
[1:38:19] on the seventh day
[1:38:22] and then
[1:38:23] they shouted
[1:38:25] we've had seven search engines folks
[1:38:28] time's running out of you and i
[1:38:32] i've never been one to make predictions
[1:38:34] but we don't have to make them now i
[1:38:36] hope you understand
[1:38:38] we are in the last days whether you
[1:38:40] believe it or not that ain't a
[1:38:41] prediction
[1:38:43] 50 more years okay no problem but that's
[1:38:45] still we're in a short period of time
[1:38:48] right a hundred years would be a short
[1:38:50] period of time
[1:38:53] we've written down two every day i said
[1:38:55] y'all realize in 50 years what we've
[1:38:56] changed from
[1:38:59] man
[1:39:04] that's planning you when i sit in your
[1:39:06] home
[1:39:08] out in the field all day
[1:39:16] i thank god i heard that jubilee man
[1:39:19] i thank god for 40 something years i've
[1:39:22] been pounding this thing
[1:39:23] to the people even in 1977
[1:39:26] go to the jubilee instead of the year
[1:39:30] and see what happens under the 70th
[1:39:34] then see what happens under the 50.
[1:39:37] then we get a total release
[1:39:41] let's stand come over here
[1:39:44] i like to know i don't know where we hit
[1:39:46] the second tape here or what we hit a
[1:39:48] second so it don't matter you had been
[1:39:50] out there talking for an hour and a half
[1:39:51] that's right were you at home there's
[1:39:53] some banana foods or something
[1:39:54] downstairs waiting on us
[1:39:58] you think i didn't know that while i was
[1:39:59] preaching
[1:40:07] that's why i've been surprised i'm
[1:40:08] trying to hurry it up
[1:40:10] or get downstairs to get that banana put
[1:40:12] i guess it's banana pudding i don't know
[1:40:13] she said like banana pudding so okay all
[1:40:16] right then i won't be feeling so bad
[1:40:19] but listen folks
[1:40:21] this message
[1:40:24] is to carry us out of here right right
[1:40:27] that's right
[1:40:28] the jubilee is when we get into it
[1:40:32] and we participate
[1:40:36] the lord descended with a shout but what
[1:40:38] about the bride saying the same thing
[1:40:39] but the shadows man
[1:40:42] that's right
[1:40:44] joshua said quote around them seven
[1:40:45] times
[1:40:46] and when you do just stop turn around
[1:40:48] and look wall
[1:40:52] and you think about it a wall so high
[1:40:55] and so much they could they could run
[1:40:57] chariot races around it six horse turret
[1:40:59] races you know things across
[1:41:04] it didn't fall over
[1:41:07] the ground opened up and swallowed it
[1:41:10] yeah
[1:41:12] they fed the crumbled already killed all
[1:41:13] those relatives too
[1:41:16] and these even a quote wrote a run said
[1:41:18] it failed okay
[1:41:22] but listen folks
[1:41:25] this message to me since 1977
[1:41:28] people have always talked about
[1:41:33] time you know that would come that the
[1:41:34] bride would have a revival
[1:41:36] i've been in a revival ever since i've
[1:41:38] been in this message
[1:41:40] when 1977 struck i wouldn't want to send
[1:41:42] my books home but yeah
[1:41:46] because i'd already prepared
[1:41:49] and i already said it could pass it
[1:41:52] do you think anybody wants to talk to me
[1:41:54] even about it now oh
[1:41:59] they don't want to talk to me now when i
[1:42:00] could say that
[1:42:02] they try to hear somebody that's made
[1:42:04] all the predictions and was wrong
[1:42:07] and proven to be wrong
[1:42:09] then you hear somebody can stand tell
[1:42:11] the truth amen
[1:42:15] to me as a human
[1:42:18] i might run around with
[1:42:20] if they don't believe you forget it well
[1:42:21] that's the way i am as a human if you
[1:42:23] don't want to believe it forget it
[1:42:25] but down inside of me there's something
[1:42:27] in there that won't let me forget it
[1:42:30] and i keep preaching
[1:42:32] and i keep trying to help everybody
[1:42:35] to try to get you to see jesus christ
[1:42:38] because without him there is no hope of
[1:42:39] any rapture whatsoever we know nothing
[1:42:42] about the message without jesus christ
[1:42:44] that's a personal experience in our
[1:42:45] hearts
[1:42:47] don't serve god as i say well and go
[1:42:49] becomes you're afraid you're going to
[1:42:50] hell
[1:42:53] get to the point where you said god if
[1:42:54] you cast me into hell i love you anyway
[1:43:01] i love you anyway lord
[1:43:03] one because look what he's done for us
[1:43:12] look what he's done for the little group
[1:43:14] at lulu
[1:43:15] we've had enough healings and signs and
[1:43:17] wonders no problem
[1:43:20] we've seen enough of god among us to
[1:43:21] know he's here
[1:43:24] we've also just kept on going with the
[1:43:25] word
[1:43:27] right down the road
[1:43:29] god's always made us
[1:43:34] but to other people when the towers fall
[1:43:37] before they start rejoicing i heard a
[1:43:39] tape with some people we've listened to
[1:43:41] that the last thing he was not servicing
[1:43:44] in 76 and they were just screaming
[1:43:47] glory glory just rejoicing screaming and
[1:43:49] no building just rejoicing we we're here
[1:43:53] it's time
[1:43:55] to where's those people now
[1:43:57] because when it went from 76 to 77 i was
[1:44:00] rejoicing and i'm still rejoicing i'm

[1:52:17] and 7.
[1:52:20] i see america turning his back on god in
