[4:26] and his disciples said unto him thou
[4:29] seeth the multitude
[4:30] darn indeed saith thou who touched me
[4:35] and he looked around about to see her
[4:38] that has done this thing
[4:40] but the woman fearing and trembling
[4:43] knowing that she
[4:45] had done in her came and fell down
[4:48] before him and told him all the truth

[9:33] get finished with this I'll give you an
[9:34] update on brother Mike I went over there
[9:36] yesterday and uh
[9:38] after work and
[9:41] went to visit him and uh
[9:44] he's got a long road to go
[9:49] and he's 80 years old
[9:51] but that don't mean nothing to God
[9:55] when brother Brown said brother now I'll
[9:56] shake your hand again
[9:58] brother Dowell was in his 90s
[10:01] all kind of problems and issues
[10:04] but we need to pray for him
[10:06] uh he does have a brain bleed
[10:10] they're not concerned with that
[10:12] he was T-boned the lady hit him in his
[10:16] side so that's where the most damage was
[10:18] and his head hit the hit the column
[10:22] didn't have side airbags it's a forward
[10:24] but anyway
[10:26] um
[10:27] he he told me he was still in pretty
[10:29] good spirits he said you know what he
[10:31] said somebody said if you didn't drive a
[10:33] Ford you wouldn't go in the Rapture I
[10:34] said
[10:39] you're not going to be driving that
[10:40] forward no more I promise you that it
[10:43] actually hit so hard it knocked the
[10:44] motor out of it broke the motor away
[10:46] from the transmission that's how that's
[10:48] how hard it hit and uh
[10:50] see that was pretty rough and but anyway
[10:52] so he's got a brain bleed they're not
[10:54] worried about that they had a little
[10:56] cover over his head
[10:58] um he had a strong handshake we held
[10:59] hands for about 20 minutes and and and
[11:01] talked about the Lord and talked about
[11:03] you know things that were going on
[11:06] um he was actually going to a brother in
[11:09] his church had died and he was going to
[11:12] visit the family to set up the
[11:13] arrangements for the funeral and that's
[11:16] when he pulled out in front of the lady
[11:18] and and uh and got hurt so just remember
[11:21] that family too in prayer because
[11:23] brother Mike won't be able to do the do
[11:25] the funeral and uh
[11:27] but he's got a brain bleed and he's got
[11:29] uh they're not cracked ribs they're
[11:30] broke
[11:31] because they punctured his lung because
[11:33] we hit on this side punctured his lung
[11:36] so they've drained the fluid out of his
[11:38] out of his lungs so he's doing better
[11:40] there his arm from here to here is is
[11:44] um well Sister Janet said bad
[11:48] and it was in one of those air casts so
[11:50] you couldn't really see uh what was
[11:52] going on but that's not a concern either
[11:54] he had open heart surgery a year ago
[11:57] almost to the well not to the day but to
[11:59] the month or two
[12:01] and
[12:03] um I guess being 80
[12:05] you heal slower we know that
[12:07] but when he hit it tore a piece of his
[12:11] aorta now I know you didn't know
[12:14] your medical terms the aorta is that big
[12:16] vessel
[12:18] and even the even at the time if they
[12:21] had him open and on the operating table
[12:23] that they ordered a burst they cannot
[12:25] save him
[12:30] but there's the god
[12:33] there's a blood clot
[12:35] that's keeping it
[12:36] from bursting right now
[12:39] so they're going in tomorrow
[12:41] laparoscopic and they're going to try to
[12:43] repair or put a shunt stent whatever and
[12:46] you'll you stand
[12:48] in that part
[12:51] we keep him stable
[12:53] but he is immobile he can't move he does
[12:56] have all of his wits about him yeah he
[12:59] was still joking yesterday but that's
[13:01] brother Mike sister Janet's okay she had
[13:04] to wear a neck collar she she didn't
[13:06] break anything and the first report was
[13:08] she broke her her big bone in her leg
[13:10] but that was not it just was bruised and
[13:13] so she was up there and she and I and
[13:15] Sister Sarah
[13:17] um
[13:18] I had a conversation outside after we
[13:21] left brother Mike and just keep him in
[13:23] prayer because it's going to be a long
[13:24] road long recovery for our brother but
[13:27] we need to get we need to pray him
[13:28] through this aorta part first
[13:31] that's that's that's the pending thing
[13:33] right now his his arm's not
[13:35] life-threatening he's the doctor said
[13:37] the brain bleed he's had two uh CAT
[13:40] scans and they said it's not getting any
[13:41] worse it's getting better so even within
[13:44] two days it's getting better so they're
[13:46] not worried about the brain bleed so
[13:47] we're not worried about that and the arm
[13:50] will take care of itself later on and so
[13:52] will the ribs but that aorta he's just
[13:55] listen you and I are that far from Death
[13:57] anyway
[13:59] right here today
[14:01] right
[14:03] heart just quit pumping you're gone
[14:06] have a blowout you're gone
[14:08] so by the grace of God we're here by the
[14:10] grace of God he's still here
[14:12] so we're just going to keep him in
[14:13] prayer
[14:16] and just keep holding him up before the
[14:18] Lord
[14:20] so that he'll get better again I told
[14:21] him that we would help all we could in
[14:23] our assembly we would help his assembly
[14:25] any way we could as far as
[14:27] presented preachers are taking care of
[14:30] the church work because you know what
[14:32] church has got to go on
[14:34] we don't want the Shepherd Smith and the
[14:38] Sheep scatter he's got some good sheep
[14:40] over there he's got some good people and
[14:42] I told him we'd help him so we may be
[14:44] later on after he gets out of the
[14:46] hospital I told him we'd meet at home
[14:48] and talk about that if he needed to but
[14:50] he just needs to get better now get that
[14:52] aorta fixed and get out of the hospital
[14:54] and but he's in really good care
[14:57] um there at Augusta University hospital
[14:59] so it's a really good good facility and
[15:02] they've got him in ICU so only a couple
[15:04] people can go see him at a time
[15:06] also I want you
[15:08] this is how God works
[15:10] Mark is his son
[15:13] and Marx has some problems
[15:16] and in life
[15:19] and about two years ago he turned away
[15:21] from the message and and uh hadn't
[15:24] spoken to his daddy in almost two years
[15:29] he was in there today or yesterday
[15:32] because that was my first question I
[15:34] said where's Mark
[15:35] and Sister Sarah said I don't know I
[15:37] said I don't know if he'll come visit
[15:38] him or not well Janet comes out of the
[15:39] ICU and and uh she said oh you can go
[15:43] back there now said Mark's back there I
[15:45] thought well praise God
[15:46] there he was standing beside his daddy
[15:48] the man
[15:51] I've always had a soft spot for him
[15:53] because he's really emotional and I told
[15:56] him I said God's going to take care of
[15:57] your daddy son
[15:59] Pete but God needs to take care of him
[16:01] but that may have been just to drive
[16:03] them back together again we know God
[16:05] works in mysterious ways but I'm telling
[16:07] you we got to believe that God knows
[16:09] best it doesn't matter if we don't think
[16:11] he knows best
[16:12] he knows best he's got this thing
[16:14] already figured out and like I said
[16:17] before the Lord's knows are the best
[16:19] yeses you'll ever get amen but he let
[16:23] brother Mike go down this road for a
[16:24] reason
[16:26] and we know that he'll not forsake Him
[16:29] and he'll I believe he'll bring him out
[16:31] of that amen bring him home and uh and
[16:35] Men quicker than than uh the doctors
[16:39] will ever think he'll men
[16:40] because what Janet said about his arm
[16:43] was that it was really bad but they're
[16:44] not concerned with it right now because
[16:46] of the side that was hit it was really
[16:48] crushed he could he could move his hand
[16:50] just a little bit I asked him I said are
[16:51] you hurting he said only when I cough
[16:54] or Bert he had to take some medicine he
[16:56] was making him burp well that part in
[16:58] his chest was hurting and that's about
[16:59] the only he said other than that he said
[17:01] I'm gonna hurt and of course they
[17:02] probably had him on some pain medicine
[17:03] but just keep him in prayer I needed to
[17:06] go see him he he's he's been a rock
[17:09] for this whole for our family for years
[17:11] and years and years he's he's just a
[17:13] fountain of wisdom
[17:15] and that's what I said going over I said
[17:16] God don't take that away from me
[17:18] don't take that away from your bride we
[17:20] need that man we need his wisdom and we
[17:24] need his comfort
[17:25] he's just a comfort to be around
[17:27] man we all know brother Mike and only
[17:29] for years so let's remember him in

[22:30] first Thessalonians 4 says that every
[22:32] one of you should know how to possess
[22:34] his vessel in sanctification and honor
[22:37] now this is where we'll talk a little
[22:39] bit more today about the mind
[22:42] I hadn't been able to get off of it I've
[22:43] been thinking a little bit more and
[22:45] we'll get into it as we go you know
[22:47] brother Brown said the right mental
[22:48] attitude
[22:50] 57 times I was reading you we're going
[22:52] to read them this afternoon we'll read
[22:53] them a few of them and I got them run
[22:55] off for you in there the right mental
[22:57] attitude not you're working up not your
[23:00] not your uh getting a gold star for
[23:02] reading your Bible not coming to church
[23:04] every Sunday the right mental attitude
[23:06] toward any promise of God
[23:09] we'll bring it to pass any promise we
[23:12] say well that's for healing no any
[23:14] promise this statue of perfect man is
[23:16] promised to make us into the image of
[23:20] God right now be not conformed to this
[23:22] world but be transformed by the renewing
[23:24] of reminders tell them brother Bob you
[23:26] know brother Brown spent all the time
[23:27] telling you that remember you got to
[23:29] take it from here down to here right
[23:32] that's 16 inches between here to here
[23:34] you got to have it drop from mental to
[23:37] here well now in the end time though
[23:39] we've got to take it from here and bring
[23:41] it back up to here
[23:43] because we got to have the mind to
[23:44] Christ we've got to have the renewing of
[23:45] our mind we can't be a double-minded man
[23:47] we can't be a double-minded bride we've
[23:50] got to take what's here now and break it
[23:52] up to here and then what that's where
[23:54] the body change comes you get born again
[23:55] then you start back up here for the body
[23:57] change that every one of you should know
[23:59] how to possess this vessel in
[24:00] sanctification and honor that you be not
[24:02] what conformed but transformed by the
[24:04] renewing of your mind what that you may
[24:06] prove you're proven today amen
[24:09] you're proven today one way or the other
[24:12] where God's right or the devil's right
[24:13] and we know that that was not right you
[24:15] just
[24:17] don't have the right mental attitude
[24:19] what is that good and acceptable and
[24:20] perfect will of God you may be seated
[24:22] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[24:24] the word
[24:25] just pray for me today
[24:28] I don't know why I got a tickle in my
[24:29] throat but
[24:31] remember now as we were talking about as
[24:33] we went through all this and the
[24:35] summation of everything I've been trying
[24:36] to get you to see Luke 8 verse 45 and
[24:41] brother Carly read it Mark
[24:43] remember somebody touched Jesus's
[24:45] garment and she was made whole
[24:48] so she had the right mental attitude she
[24:50] said if I can get to him if I can just
[24:53] touch His Garment not him pray not him
[24:55] do anything just me touch His Garment
[24:57] then I'll be made whole all right that's
[25:00] how simple it is what we try to do is as
[25:02] we get it up here so much so we this is
[25:04] where we muddle it up
[25:06] listen
[25:07] if you're born again in your soul that's
[25:09] God that's positive that's eternal
[25:12] everybody with me right here this is
[25:15] where the Battleground is not here
[25:17] you've already fought the Bible if you
[25:19] got the new birth now if you don't have
[25:20] any birth then you've still got a battle
[25:22] down here you got a heart battle
[25:25] you need to change your heart but once
[25:27] you get a change of heart
[25:29] and you know you preachers around the
[25:32] messages like I said you got that group
[25:34] over here that says well we got to get
[25:36] them you know we got to get um emotional
[25:38] and it's over here so we don't need the
[25:40] emotion we need the word bring them
[25:41] together
[25:43] always this church has always been
[25:45] balanced bring it together bring it to
[25:48] where we do get emotional every once in
[25:50] a while but as a man brother Bob was
[25:52] talking listen folks let me tell you
[25:53] something
[25:55] this church has no excuse to not go up
[25:58] inside to a perfect man
[26:03] none
[26:05] none
[26:07] why because you got churches that are
[26:09] still preaching to Soul Doctrine you got
[26:11] churches in the message that's still
[26:13] preaching two Lords you got people to
[26:15] message preaching Daniel 70 weeks wrong
[26:17] you got them preaching the Seal's wrong
[26:19] you got all these wrong doctrines God is
[26:22] going yes God will I promise you he'll
[26:26] bring some of them up
[26:28] but not as a body as a church body he
[26:31] can't do that he cannot bring you up
[26:33] that's not your perfect man with false
[26:34] word that's why Peter is the one that
[26:37] starred on the day of Pentecost and then
[26:39] now Peter comes to bring these Faith
[26:41] versions places Garland's brother
[26:43] kindness right
[26:44] because he
[26:46] yeah I'm gonna read your quote here in a
[26:48] few minutes but brother Brown said the
[26:49] apostle apostles were not like
[26:52] us wow
[26:54] the apostles were not like us
[26:57] they would step out preach a sermon and
[26:59] didn't care what anybody thought about
[27:00] him and they walked off I'll read it to
[27:02] you here in just a few minutes
[27:03] amen
[27:05] because remember they had all these
[27:08] virtues they didn't have false Doctrine
[27:10] sure there was Grievous wolf sure there
[27:12] was uh little things that was going on
[27:14] little foxes that were spoiling the vine
[27:16] but there was a true church there and
[27:18] that true church was being built on what
[27:20] the statue of a perfect man they just
[27:23] didn't have the headstone and that's
[27:24] what me and you got to have this right
[27:26] before the headstone can come there's no
[27:28] way you can put a roof on a house unless
[27:30] you got the walls right that's right
[27:32] oh you might want to
[27:36] Place gonna fall
[27:38] it's going to fall it's not going to
[27:40] stay steady
[27:41] brother I'm saying the statue of perfect
[27:43] answer the first thing you got to do is
[27:44] be born again I'm trying to harp on this
[27:46] more and more really don't think you're
[27:48] born again you got to know that you know
[27:50] that you know that that has dropped from
[27:52] a mental attitude down there yeah then
[27:54] let that work its way back up
[27:57] into your mind and that's where the
[27:59] battle is
[28:00] I'll read this scripture man where James
[28:02] says a double-minded man is unstable
[28:05] should I go to church should I not
[28:07] that's the promise of God
[28:11] should I
[28:12] or should I
[28:14] you see where the battle is
[28:17] listen if y'all don't have a battle then
[28:19] I'm just preaching to me and I'm gonna
[28:20] just keep preaching to me till I get
[28:21] okay all right the rest of y'all can
[28:23] just sit there and look at me with a bug
[28:25] eyes if you want to but what's he
[28:27] talking about
[28:28] no you got to become a new creation
[28:30] though you got to be able to when Monday
[28:31] comes you got to be able to what discern
[28:35] discern when the devil talks to you
[28:37] because like brothers always said the
[28:39] devil the devil is not one of these
[28:41] no he's got a nice little sweet voice
[28:45] ah go ahead yeah it's not gonna hurt
[28:48] anything just do it
[28:51] God may be the one that says hi
[28:54] dummy stop
[28:58] I'll read you a quote here this
[29:00] afternoon where brother Branham gave us
[29:03] a formula to get what we need
[29:05] he gave us a formula
[29:10] it starts with knowing the will of God
[29:11] first not your will
[29:13] be talking about selfishness we've got
[29:15] to get away there's no way we can come
[29:17] up this not your perfect man and be
[29:19] selfish
[29:21] you got to be able to give what you got
[29:24] give what you got to me that's the
[29:26] virtue Jesus gave what he had
[29:29] Peter and and whoever it was that and
[29:31] Peter and John at the gate beautiful
[29:33] they gave what they had
[29:35] silver and gold how about none but what
[29:37] I have amen not what I can go read in a
[29:40] quote book come on somebody why do I go
[29:43] to church on Wednesday
[29:45] we ought to try doing that every once in
[29:46] a while cut church on Wednesday and let
[29:49] me just get this little added no they
[29:52] were walking down the road and they were
[29:53] going probably going to Walmart
[29:55] all right let me bring it to now
[29:58] and this guy standing back her and he
[30:00] says I need some money and John Peter's
[30:02] like
[30:03] we're poor
[30:06] but what I have
[30:07] I'm gonna give it to you
[30:10] and what strength virtue went out of him
[30:12] to what give that guy what he had been
[30:16] what listen that guy had been from his
[30:18] youth
[30:20] had had that infirmary from his youth
[30:23] he said silver and gold would have my
[30:24] number such as I have Divine today rise
[30:26] up and walk
[30:29] hey man
[30:30] so now we we're commissioned this is our
[30:32] commission leave the principles of the
[30:34] doctrine of Christ as I said before
[30:36] people can make excuses in different
[30:39] places but listen more is given more is
[30:44] required
[30:45] all right so you've been given more
[30:47] we've been given more so we're required
[30:50] somebody is going to break this chain of
[30:53] death
[30:54] it just might as well be us
[30:57] amenities might as well be me and you it
[31:00] just may as well be right here in this
[31:02] congregation today start you got to
[31:04] start somewhere today is the day of your
[31:06] salvation
[31:08] let us go on into Perfection not laying
[31:10] again the foundation of repentance to
[31:12] dead works and Faith toward God
[31:15] you know
[31:16] I was thinking the other day
[31:18] in my mind
[31:21] we let that thing so overcome us
[31:26] remember I'm going to tell you here in
[31:27] just a few minutes it's all in your head
[31:30] how many times have you fabricated
[31:32] something in your head and it never come
[31:33] to pass about six million this week amen
[31:37] never come to pass it never even turned
[31:40] out the way you thought it would turn
[31:41] out that's your thinking but when God
[31:44] thinks about something that always comes
[31:46] to pass and that's why we have to shift
[31:49] into that mind of God
[31:51] yeah let this come up here
[31:54] let this come up here that's why you
[31:56] gotta be born again here let this come
[31:58] up
[32:00] into what not stinking thinking of the
[32:02] world but the thinking of the mind of
[32:04] Christ
[32:05] but the doctrines of baptism laying on
[32:08] of hands resurrection of the Dead
[32:10] we need to not get away from that as far
[32:13] as putting it to the side but we need to
[32:15] build on that we need to build on the
[32:18] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[32:19] Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone
[32:21] we need to build what build up a house
[32:24] how listen to the word of God listen to
[32:28] the apostles prophets evangelists
[32:30] pastors and teachers for what the
[32:32] perfecting of the Saints they asked
[32:34] brother Ryan one time said brother
[32:36] around we can't get perfect how many
[32:37] times you ever heard somebody tell you
[32:38] that I just can't perfect you ain't
[32:40] perfect yeah well the Bible says you're
[32:42] supposed to be
[32:43] for the perfecting of the Saints me and
[32:45] you
[32:46] for the work of the ministry the
[32:48] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[32:51] all come what to the unity of the faith
[32:53] look and see it's not a Unity at all
[32:55] we're divided
[32:57] even in the message we're divided
[33:00] amen
[33:01] but the world is so divided they don't
[33:03] know what's right they don't know what's
[33:04] wrong I went to get blood the other day
[33:06] and you know what you ought to give
[33:07] blood if you can
[33:09] sorry you're helping human beings Jim's
[33:11] like a galleon zillionaire she's given
[33:13] so many gallons of blood there's more of
[33:15] her in that building than they are
[33:16] sitting here today
[33:18] they love her buddy they get the pump
[33:20] out when she comes in though you know
[33:22] it's like fill her up or take it away
[33:24] from her anyway so I went and gave blood
[33:26] and they asked me the first question
[33:28] at Birth
[33:31] are you a male or female
[33:34] hold on a minute I'm not done
[33:37] the next question is do you still still
[33:40] consider yourself
[33:42] and you had to check one of the two now
[33:45] that you're in other words you're older
[33:48] do you consider yourself still a male in
[33:50] other words
[33:51] help me Lord
[33:54] and I told that lady said now I think it
[33:56] was Yolanda who was sitting there and I
[33:57] said
[33:58] she said you have to answer the question
[34:02] so I answered the question
[34:04] so now listen they should be no more
[34:07] gender reveal parties
[34:10] because the world says we're supposed to
[34:11] wait till they're five or six and let
[34:13] them decide if they're a boy or a girl
[34:14] so why do you need to shoot something
[34:16] and make pink go off when that girl
[34:17] wants to be a boy do you see how
[34:20] Sodom and Gomorrah wasn't this bad
[34:25] you know why Sodom and Gomorrah didn't
[34:27] have internet
[34:29] and didn't have all these sites and
[34:31] nights and websites and all that other
[34:32] kind of stuff
[34:35] but you and I if this promises we got to
[34:37] come to the unity of faith we will do
[34:39] that
[34:40] under the measure of the Statue of the
[34:42] fullness of Christ look that we
[34:43] henceforth be no more children
[34:45] be no more babies
[34:47] toss to and fro and carried about with
[34:49] every wind of Doctrine by the slight of
[34:51] men what preachers and cunning crafting
[34:54] that's where violated lion weight to
[34:55] deceive but look speaking the truth in
[34:57] love
[34:58] May grow up now the truth in love is the
[35:01] correct Doctrine
[35:03] May grow up in Him in all things which
[35:05] is the head even Christ from whom the
[35:08] whole body now you and I are the body
[35:09] not your natural body but your body the
[35:12] body of Christ fitly joined together and
[35:15] compacted like I said before you better
[35:16] make sure you get it compacted because
[35:18] the devil will absolutely stick his
[35:20] nasty finger wherever you gotta crack
[35:23] amen
[35:24] but it's promised that we're going to be
[35:26] compacted as promised it in this age you
[35:29] know a long time ago when they couldn't
[35:31] fly rocket up into the atmosphere you
[35:34] know they just got in an airplane an
[35:35] airplane as I explained to you a long
[35:37] time ago about the speed of sound when
[35:40] you get that whatever his name was Chuck
[35:42] Yeager he would get almost to the speed
[35:44] of sound or the other people and they
[35:45] would stop
[35:47] because everything starts shaking they
[35:49] thought it's gonna explode
[35:51] but what did Chuck Yeager do he said I
[35:53] don't know what I did I just pushed it
[35:55] on forward and went further when you
[35:57] broke when you break that sound barrier
[35:59] it's just like cool water
[36:01] he said it just straightened well that's
[36:02] what me and you
[36:05] push it
[36:06] I'm telling you today push it yeah
[36:09] push it to its limit because listen God
[36:11] Has No Limit well I don't know it may
[36:14] shake me shake me
[36:17] shake me but look take that stick and
[36:19] push it forward
[36:20] take that stick and push it up to start
[36:22] to a perfect man
[36:25] listen the right mental attitude you
[36:27] gotta ask God for virtue God let me take
[36:30] what I got teach me how to use it and
[36:33] that's why he gave us Apostles prophets
[36:34] Pastor teaching in advance to what to
[36:37] teach us how to do it
[36:39] to teach us how to become listen Paul
[36:41] never in his life
[36:43] everybody with me
[36:45] it's hot in here
[36:47] never and y'all gonna start falling
[36:49] asleep Aaron if you don't come come
[36:51] please come up here and check this thing
[36:52] out turn it on I know we're in between
[36:54] seasons
[36:56] it's cold outside and it's warm in here
[36:59] and then when you balance it out
[37:01] the air conditioner never comes on
[37:02] because it's cool out there
[37:04] but we need some air conditioning right
[37:06] now
[37:08] but we need the mind of Christ we don't
[37:10] need to what be conformed to the world
[37:14] so listen when we start up this statue
[37:16] of perfect man we've got to be totally
[37:19] contrary to our whole life
[37:21] our whole General Life we've got to be
[37:24] totally contrary
[37:28] totally contrary
[37:30] to everything you have grown up in your
[37:33] life whether you're 80 or eight amen
[37:36] everybody with me
[37:39] because you got to take up his cross we
[37:41] do each one of us
[37:42] it's an individual affair with God it's
[37:44] not the preacher and you it's not your
[37:46] wife and you it's you and God Amen
[37:50] mama don't go
[37:52] won't hinder me
[37:54] sister don't go won't hinder me
[37:58] that's our problem like I said before
[38:00] and where do we fabricate that
[38:03] right here
[38:05] we fabricate it right here in our brain
[38:07] I'm going to find that quote somebody
[38:09] said I'll find it somewhere and I know
[38:12] brother if I do say well brother Joe's
[38:14] up here usually when I say something
[38:15] he's up and he goes well here's what he
[38:16] said but there was somebody a doctor or
[38:19] somebody a psychologist said you'd spend
[38:21] 90 percent of your time
[38:23] worrying about stuff or about like
[38:26] Donnie what Donnie thinks of me and what
[38:29] this one thinks of me when they spend
[38:31] two percent worrying about you
[38:34] you spent 19 he's not worried about what
[38:36] everybody else thinks about you
[38:38] and they're not worrying about you no
[38:39] they got their own problems
[38:41] to worry about
[38:44] I'll find out though
[38:46] I Die daily Paul said
[38:48] but Paul never let me get back to Paul
[38:50] never heard about a seal
[38:54] Paul died before John went to Patmos he
[38:57] 'll see a one CO2 seal three he really
[39:00] never heard of the church ages
[39:02] everybody with me that he probably had
[39:04] some he knew he had something to do with
[39:06] Ephesians because he knew he was their
[39:08] messenger or the prophet I'm pretty sure
[39:11] he knew he was a prophet when he was
[39:12] pending all this thing but what he was
[39:14] doing he was pinning the seals
[39:17] so me and you can read them
[39:20] he never mentioned them
[39:23] but he said we need to know the Deep
[39:25] things of God
[39:26] we need to in other words we need to
[39:28] grow up we need to do this we need to do
[39:31] that
[39:32] you know Paul was a wonderful man
[39:36] but he died way before even John came on
[39:38] and then the then the the church age
[39:40] messenger started coming after that but
[39:42] we all look back brother Brown said what
[39:44] do we do we look back to Paul the
[39:45] pattern messenger
[39:47] so what he did we pattern after that he
[39:50] built churches he what'd he do he helped
[39:52] them grow
[39:56] spent some time
[39:58] got a brother established and he went to
[40:00] stop he didn't just say well bless God
[40:01] just do the best you can and he takes
[40:02] off no Paul was patient
[40:05] he would get him established in Ephesus
[40:07] he'd go to Corinth he may have spent a
[40:08] little more time in Corinth than he did
[40:10] anywhere else but they were Corinthians
[40:12] the book of Corrections so the
[40:13] Corinthians they had all these kind of
[40:16] like us had all these sayings and
[40:17] doctrines and all these different issues
[40:19] and Paul what'd you do he stayed there
[40:22] with him and he got a bride out of them
[40:24] because remember he listed all that
[40:25] whole stuff that we used to be
[40:27] Yes Man wasn't good people
[40:32] he said what's such for some of you
[40:35] but you're washed
[40:37] you're Sanctified in other words with
[40:39] the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:41] and Paul stood up one day and said now
[40:43] you're going to be judged by what I say
[40:45] you're gonna be judged by my gospel
[40:48] folks you're going to be judged by the
[40:49] gospels priests here yes yes you're not
[40:51] going to be judged by the gospel priests
[40:52] and Happy Valley or anywhere else you
[40:54] want to say right here
[40:56] this is where you're going to be judged
[40:58] by you're not even going to be judged by
[40:59] what said in Jeffersonville
[41:03] come on
[41:06] for so it is the will of God that with
[41:08] well-doing you may put to silence that's
[41:09] what I want to do put to silence the
[41:12] ignorance of foolish men
[41:17] you said bro wait that's kind of hard
[41:18] can we read that one more time
[41:21] I didn't I didn't say that Peter did the
[41:23] one that says you got to have patience
[41:25] the one that said you got to have all
[41:27] these virtues said for so is the will of
[41:29] God that with well-doing you may put to
[41:32] silence the ignorance of foolish men
[41:37] he was running a church brother I'm
[41:39] saying now we got to come to full
[41:40] Doctrine I like good shout meetings so
[41:42] do we we like that but now bubble
[41:44] dancing and all that stuff but when what
[41:46] and in other words when Monday happens
[41:48] when the rubber meets the road when
[41:50] you're out there by yourself and you
[41:51] can't get to a preacher you can't get to
[41:54] you know somebody that you what pull
[41:56] virtue from you got to start having it
[41:58] yourself
[42:01] you don't know where you're standing we
[42:04] must know as a church where we're
[42:05] standing
[42:06] hey man let's get back and find out find
[42:10] out what's making us do that that's what
[42:12] we're doing today let's find out what's
[42:14] making us be still here
[42:18] 60 something years after the prophet
[42:20] said the Rapture is overdue
[42:22] 60 years the rapture's overdue
[42:25] what's the problem
[42:28] look in the mirror
[42:31] no it's brother Brown's fault well no I
[42:34] don't think so
[42:35] no it's your fault
[42:37] now look brother Ryan said all right
[42:39] look but when it comes to The Showdown
[42:40] that's what we're coming to folks I'm
[42:42] telling you just like I said before God
[42:44] is going to make you make a decision one
[42:46] way or the other you've got to make a
[42:48] choice
[42:49] one way or the other before you pass
[42:51] away before you take your last breath
[42:53] are we going to fall in the body change
[42:55] you're going to have to make a choice
[42:59] one way or the other
[43:01] that's right but when it comes to The
[43:02] Showdown are you able to possess the
[43:05] thing that you profess to have that's
[43:08] the thing brother we've got to get it
[43:09] we've got to take it it's ours but
[43:12] you'll fight for every inch
[43:16] you know I'm talking about Battleship
[43:18] cruise ship you know on a cruise ship
[43:19] when we want to cruise I mean June it
[43:21] was just so nice and everybody was so
[43:23] nice and the guys would you know bring
[43:25] us like nice Linens and and there was no
[43:28] enemies on that boat I mean we just had
[43:31] a good time when you get on a battleship
[43:33] everybody on that ship including the
[43:35] cook knows how to fire a rifle
[43:37] including the cup and it including the
[43:40] janitor and including the maintenance
[43:41] man he knows how to fight
[43:44] amen and when you know what when it said
[43:47] all hands on deck it meant all hands on
[43:51] deck there would be thousands of them
[43:53] like ants that run up there on the on
[43:55] the deck and start fighting
[43:57] because it's the battle it wasn't a
[43:59] cruise ship it was a battleship
[44:01] you either get killed or killed one of
[44:03] the two
[44:05] we've all tried every Christian every
[44:07] son every child that comes to God is
[44:08] Tried by the word to see if you'll
[44:10] belong to who tries you by the word
[44:17] look at job that was job job was a
[44:20] righteous man good man did everything
[44:22] right
[44:25] look what happened to him
[44:27] but in the very end
[44:29] we're still talking about job is God
[44:32] still talking about you
[44:34] you think about that is God still
[44:35] talking about you he still we're still
[44:37] talking about Joe
[44:40] cause you're renting Epistles they're
[44:41] gonna ask you I promise you when we get
[44:43] over there they're gonna say what age
[44:44] did you come from they said well we're
[44:46] not allowed to sin they said come on sit
[44:48] down and tell me because the Bible I
[44:50] read said yo that was the nastiest age
[44:53] there ever was
[44:57] right see if you'll be loyal to it when
[44:58] The Showdown comes how many times I
[45:00] showed there's gonna be a showdown folks
[45:01] you're either gonna be ready for it
[45:03] though but now what if you took the
[45:05] battleship and the cruise ship
[45:08] and switched all the crew people
[45:14] the cruise ship over here their crew
[45:16] goes over here and gets in the
[45:17] battleship what they're going to do
[45:20] I just know how to put knives and forks
[45:22] on the table
[45:23] and he's over here said well I didn't
[45:25] I'm not equipped how can I fight with it
[45:27] but you know what then they're trying to
[45:28] fight they still gonna take that fight
[45:30] over there in that cruise ship and if
[45:32] they have to use knives and force
[45:34] they'll kill you with them same way with
[45:36] the devil brother Brown said if you
[45:37] ain't if you don't have no teeth in your
[45:39] head say gum him to death
[45:42] chew on him
[45:45] don't let that guy have any upper hand
[45:47] coach where is it at not here if you're
[45:49] born again it's right here
[45:51] right here's where we're losing it in
[45:53] the mind
[45:54] memory reason conscious affection
[45:56] imagination
[45:57] that's all in your head
[46:03] I thank God we're still going to have
[46:04] memory
[46:05] we're definitely still gonna have memory
[46:07] when we get there right
[46:08] but it's not going to be a memory of the
[46:10] bad
[46:10] it's going to be memory of the good
[46:12] it's not going to be a memory that hey
[46:14] like brother Mike I was thinking about
[46:16] that I said you know when we get over on
[46:18] the other side he's not even going to
[46:20] have
[46:21] opinion
[46:23] in his body Danny where you at buddy
[46:26] no you must scar
[46:28] that's what God will do
[46:30] that's the power of God
[46:32] they'll take your body change it take
[46:34] all the scars out of it put everything
[46:35] back if you had your Penance took out
[46:37] they put the pendants back in all that
[46:39] it's a change of the body everybody with
[46:40] me and man so you ought to be happy this
[46:43] is just light affliction
[46:45] if you ask Michael T today what here's
[46:47] your problem he said oh this is just
[46:49] light affliction
[46:51] because what is his attitude
[46:54] and he that cannot stand chastisement
[46:56] but goes on with the world he is an
[46:58] illegitimate child and not and Son and
[47:01] Daughter of God certainly not you know I
[47:03] think you know today you got Paul Paul's
[47:06] preaching away and he's preaching and
[47:08] and he's uh he's he's he's telling the
[47:12] people about the resurrection and then
[47:14] all of a sudden who is at Phillips and
[47:15] hymenius they go off and start preaching
[47:17] his doctrine that the resurrection had
[47:19] already come well you know he didn't
[47:21] mind rebuking him from the pulpit
[47:25] hello somebody
[47:26] he said Simon the coppersmith has caused
[47:30] me all kind of problems
[47:31] the seven sons of skiva they're against
[47:34] me
[47:36] yes Demas has forsaken me
[47:40] and that's in the Bible
[47:43] but the spiritually mind it catches the
[47:46] word lines up with it and the spirit
[47:48] comes down under the shed blood and
[47:49] takes that person
[47:52] you know you would be a you would be a
[47:55] celebrity if you said
[47:59] this alien came down
[48:02] Jonas
[48:04] Jonas said this alien came down and took
[48:06] me up in a ship
[48:09] he had like one eye
[48:11] he's green
[48:13] but he spoke English
[48:16] he'd be a celebrity but tell somebody
[48:18] that you had what
[48:23] and take you somewhere in your soul take
[48:25] you into another dimension and change
[48:28] your mind and make your attitude
[48:29] different you're not gonna be on the
[48:31] front page of the paper you're going to
[48:33] be in the back part with it put the nuts
[48:38] I was abducted by an alien
[48:43] didn't the Bible say we're aliens
[48:45] ah
[48:46] we're alienated we're aliens of this
[48:49] world
[48:50] when you get the new birth God comes
[48:53] down and burns out the old you the old
[48:55] world and it makes you a new Creator a
[48:58] new creature a new creation look it's a
[49:01] paradox
[49:02] remember we talked about the three
[49:03] Hebrew children we'll continue through
[49:05] that but remember
[49:07] every time you go through a trouble or a
[49:09] trial remember it's to loose you because
[49:13] the heavenly father is not going to ever
[49:14] bind you he's going to lose you so
[49:17] everything you go through
[49:20] and that's sometimes what a man has to
[49:22] do come out make his stand get the thing
[49:25] out he's talking about somebody drowning
[49:26] and get him out of the thing so he can
[49:29] get the thing out of him we got to get
[49:30] out of our stinking thinking we got to
[49:32] get out of our I can't make it I'm gonna
[49:34] read you this afternoon where brother
[49:36] Brown talks about the right mental
[49:37] attitude he said you've got to believe
[49:40] what you believe
[49:42] you gotta literally believe what you're
[49:44] thinking
[49:45] because sometimes we don't believe what
[49:47] we're thinking
[49:48] everybody with me
[49:50] why if it's of God it's got to be
[49:53] positive
[49:55] now there's a perfect way in a
[49:57] permissive way and I feel it's a God
[49:59] here on the platform can show me things
[50:00] that's been in my rooms and so forth
[50:02] it's talking about private interview
[50:03] he's able to tell me just where he wants
[50:06] me and what he wants me to do
[50:09] but I feel as long as I've got it all
[50:11] hooked up another I me I selfish me
[50:15] then he won't put his hand on it as long
[50:17] as I'm doing it and that's the way it is
[50:18] anything as long as you're going to do
[50:21] it if someone talks about you and you
[50:23] talk back about them God can't fight
[50:25] your battle
[50:27] you're fighting it yourself
[50:31] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[50:32] says if somebody speaks against you if
[50:34] you don't speak against them what does
[50:35] it do it Heats colds of fire on top of
[50:37] them
[50:38] it Heats it all back to them but now
[50:40] here we want to do we want to know we
[50:42] want to give them a piece of our what
[50:44] piece of our what
[50:46] oh it's all in the mind
[50:50] if you give them a piece of your soul
[50:52] you want to give them the Holy Ghost now
[50:53] we want to give him a piece of our mind
[50:55] when the guy cuts us off
[50:58] and body sometimes if
[51:00] back in the world you get that one
[51:01] finger wave
[51:03] why because you know what that's what
[51:05] was motivated in you though
[51:09] and I have an issue with that
[51:11] not shooting birds but I have an issue
[51:14] with people
[51:15] you know not driving right
[51:17] so
[51:18] I got another issue that I'm going to
[51:20] tell you what I'm going to do and I'm
[51:21] going to tell you right now
[51:23] the Lord has corrected me on one thing
[51:26] besides the other 700 this is one so
[51:29] 6.99 I'm not telling you about this one
[51:31] I'm going to somebody helps us to touch
[51:33] you now there you go
[51:37] you know how many times have I told
[51:39] y'all
[51:40] I like one kind of cat
[51:43] it's well known
[51:45] a dead one
[51:47] I don't like cats I never have like cats
[51:49] brother Brown even says they carry
[51:51] Spirits okay
[51:53] but I think I'm gonna go get me a cab
[51:56] I ain't even told you in that but the
[51:57] Lord listen to y'all think it's funny
[51:59] the Lord has convicted me on that
[52:03] you know what brother Brown stood up one
[52:05] day and he called them Ricky's and
[52:06] rickettas and all these different things
[52:07] and brother Branham said God took me
[52:10] behind the Woodshed in other words
[52:12] and told me he said you stopped that he
[52:14] said those are my people well God said
[52:17] you stopped that the other day he said
[52:18] that's my creature
[52:20] he said that's a part of my economy
[52:22] that's a part of my nature so I'm
[52:24] probably gonna go get a cat
[52:26] what programs they do if you don't like
[52:28] something
[52:29] do the vice versa you know what he said
[52:32] if you want to quit stealing I mean quit
[52:35] um being selfish start giving stuff away
[52:39] Micah you didn't know I was gonna preach
[52:40] on cats today did you
[52:43] the greatest weapon look
[52:46] y'all don't understand what I just said
[52:49] that's freedom
[52:52] that's Freedom just to change my
[52:54] attitude toward one item it wasn't seals
[52:58] and plagues and vowels it was a kitty
[53:00] cat
[53:03] funny I looked at him as just
[53:05] let's run over that
[53:07] but not anymore
[53:09] oh and y'all don't have nothing y'all
[53:11] just said wow we need to pray for
[53:13] brother away my Lord him and his cat
[53:15] thing well guess what come up here and
[53:18] tell me what yours is are you too
[53:19] embarrassed
[53:21] huh are you too embarrassed
[53:26] but you know what it's Freedom now
[53:29] you know what that did that bound me
[53:32] you say oh no yes it does because it
[53:35] bothered me
[53:36] and God brought it to my attention none
[53:38] of y'all did
[53:40] because you knew how I felt about it
[53:42] but God said hey that's my that's my
[53:44] that's no words that's my animal that's
[53:46] my nature I created that
[53:50] I had a guy tell me the other day we
[53:51] were we're uh we were he works in the
[53:53] Gainesville post office but he lives on
[53:55] my postal route
[53:57] and I told him I said look I said um
[53:59] I've seen so many squirrels have y'all
[54:01] not seen so many squirrels
[54:03] squirrels on top of squirrels people
[54:04] don't go squirrel hunting anymore so
[54:06] they squirrels everywhere there's one
[54:08] curve down on my route I call it
[54:10] squirrel curve that's probably 50 of
[54:12] them in there and he said well I just he
[54:15] said I don't try to dodge him I run over
[54:17] them I try to dodge them I'll wreck that
[54:19] vehicle before I hit a pearl squirrel
[54:24] my attitude versus his
[54:26] he said I just try to run over him with
[54:28] his male Jeep you know I said well I
[54:30] don't try to run over them
[54:32] I said I try not to hit them
[54:34] but you see that the right mental
[54:36] attitude though
[54:37] you say that don't mean nothing to me
[54:39] well something we may mean to you what I
[54:42] just said something you're working with
[54:43] or something you're dealing with just
[54:45] give it to God and look do the vice
[54:48] versa yeah
[54:49] yeah do the opposite
[54:51] boy that's a lot of Revelation well
[54:53] that's what the prophet said
[54:56] look it's a committal to God when you
[54:58] can't do nothing about it just commit it
[55:00] to him and God will take care of it
[55:04] what's your problem we try to take care
[55:06] of it
[55:08] how many years I've tried to save our
[55:09] kids
[55:11] let us all have a confessional today
[55:14] okay
[55:15] you can't do it
[55:19] turn them over to God
[55:21] you know best you know how to get them
[55:24] here you got me here
[55:27] right you got me here and the monk I was
[55:30] in you got me here bring them here
[55:38] amen so an Army first getting ready for
[55:41] a battle first thing got to be a select
[55:43] some soldiers they got to be dressed for
[55:45] fighting they got to be trained for
[55:47] fightings what we've been talking about
[55:48] a few minutes ago and I believe it's the
[55:50] greatest battle that was ever fought
[55:51] it's now ready
[55:54] is now ready to go into action
[55:58] now
[55:59] not 1960 what two
[56:01] no
[56:04] they fought a different battle than me
[56:05] and you
[56:08] 1962 they fought a different battle than
[56:10] me and you fight
[56:11] they're fighting just to stay alive in
[56:13] in the Christian realm you and I are
[56:14] fighting for a body change you and I are
[56:16] fighting fighting for going up the stats
[56:17] of perfect man bringing Jesus Christ
[56:19] back to the Earth and me and you that's
[56:22] what we're fighting for amen
[56:24] because that's our mandate the greatest
[56:26] battle ever fall is now ready to go into
[56:28] action I believe that God has been
[56:30] selecting his soldiers I believe he's
[56:32] been dressing them training them and the
[56:35] Battlefront is now set getting ready to
[56:37] start when we know where that's at right
[56:39] by the by the title of the sermon
[56:43] the greatest battle ever fought
[56:45] there has to be a place selected there's
[56:48] a mutual ground in no man's land and
[56:51] they fight at that place they just don't
[56:53] one fight over here and one over here
[56:54] and one run over here there's a battle
[56:57] front where they meet and test their
[56:59] powers
[57:00] where each Army tested strength against
[57:02] the other a mutual meeting place now
[57:04] don't miss this
[57:05] when the great battle started on earth
[57:07] now remember he's talking about the
[57:09] battle that started in heaven
[57:11] there was a battle of Heaven first
[57:12] Michael and his angels against the devil
[57:15] and his angels Satan was cast down here
[57:17] and now brother Brown said now the
[57:18] battle's down here
[57:20] that's why I said before Redemption
[57:22] didn't happen in heaven it was
[57:23] formulated in heaven in the mind of God
[57:25] but Redemption happens on the earth
[57:26] because something's got to fall that's
[57:28] right all right and we fell so we got to
[57:30] what be redeemed back
[57:33] there had to be a place selected for the
[57:35] battle to begin and for the battle to
[57:37] rage and that Battleground begins in the
[57:39] human mind there's where the battle
[57:41] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[57:43] place of battle where it was beginning
[57:45] that is because that decisions
[57:48] are made from the mind the head
[57:52] that's right that's what we'll talk
[57:53] about this afternoon though when you get
[57:54] the right mental attitude and you look
[57:56] at what brother Brown did the the thing
[57:58] he went through to get to the will of
[58:00] God you'll understand maybe a little bit
[58:02] more
[58:03] they never started it from some
[58:04] mechanical Affair the grounds never
[58:06] started there therefore that
[58:08] organization could never never do the
[58:09] work of God let me put in their false
[58:11] Doctrine can never do it
[58:13] false Doctrine cannot do it God is not
[58:16] in false Doctrine don't like it and
[58:18] never did he formulate false Doctrine
[58:20] where did false Doctrine come from it
[58:23] didn't come from the listen to me it
[58:25] didn't come from the Holy Ghost in their
[58:27] heart
[58:29] because the Holy Ghost can't be wrong
[58:31] where'd it come from
[58:33] right here
[58:35] he came from your mind
[58:37] any Doctrine against the word of God was
[58:40] formulated in some man's mind so I said
[58:43] before if you're witnessing to somebody
[58:44] they said oh oh y'all just like y'all
[58:47] live in the Old Testament we're living
[58:48] in the New Testament that's a bunch of
[58:50] baloney but we live in both
[58:53] but all you gotta do is say look if you
[58:55] got a girl sitting there with a pair of
[58:56] pants on and cutting her hair say who
[58:59] told you you could do that
[59:01] who told you you can wait it was all
[59:02] right for you to wear a pants some man
[59:03] had tea because the Bible didn't
[59:06] that's right at least our sisters are
[59:08] trying to live by the Bible and we can
[59:10] go back to the old our new testament
[59:12] either one and say we're trying to live
[59:14] what the Bible says not what some man
[59:16] says
[59:18] because remember everything that's false
[59:20] is in your head
[59:22] it's all in your head
[59:25] right I mean how many times have people
[59:27] told you that
[59:28] you get to stay in your pain you get to
[59:30] sell you get this problem get this thing
[59:32] holy man it's all in your head
[59:36] that's where it starts
[59:39] Eve let Satan into her mind first
[59:43] and she began to what think
[59:46] contrary to the word of God
[59:49] one word not a whole list
[59:52] the problem was is she started preaching
[59:57] hello somebody boy it gets quiet when
[59:58] you're talking about women preachers
[1:00:01] it started with her preaching to start
[1:00:03] what she should have done she said look
[1:00:05] I'm the weaker vessel
[1:00:08] let me go get Adam you know what
[1:00:09] happened to that Beast he went to the
[1:00:11] far end of the garden
[1:00:13] hey man
[1:00:15] he wasn't going to challenge Adam
[1:00:17] but he challenged Eve because of her as
[1:00:19] we were explaining last Sunday and I
[1:00:21] hope you all enjoyed that I enjoyed
[1:00:22] answering those questions last Sunday
[1:00:24] I've got some good comments off of it
[1:00:25] and I hope I've answered the question
[1:00:27] that you asked right
[1:00:30] because a woman is a weaker vessel
[1:00:32] that's just I'm sorry that's just the
[1:00:33] way it is
[1:00:35] all right
[1:00:36] but a holy ghost woman can teach you
[1:00:38] something she just can't do it from back
[1:00:39] here all right but we know that I don't
[1:00:41] have to preach on women preachers my
[1:00:43] Heavens but that's where it all got
[1:00:44] started women preachers
[1:00:48] she preached the sermon it was wrong
[1:00:51] that's my brother around said God had to
[1:00:53] what now take a double Covenant the man
[1:00:55] had to be above the woman she couldn't
[1:00:56] teach or preach the Earthship Authority
[1:00:58] in the church the man was the head all
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:00] listen when we try to urge up authority
[1:01:03] over Christ which is our head what
[1:01:05] happens to us
[1:01:06] we come out from under the will of God
[1:01:08] and we're standing out there like Eve
[1:01:10] naked
[1:01:11] and alone and here comes the Beast
[1:01:17] I'll teach you something you've never
[1:01:19] heard before
[1:01:20] boy I did I have heard some things I've
[1:01:23] never heard before I didn't want to hear
[1:01:24] them again either
[1:01:27] Aaron right amen
[1:01:30] well let's don't be selfish
[1:01:33] you think I'm trying to doing this over
[1:01:35] and over again but
[1:01:37] a selfish attitude will hurt you it will
[1:01:39] not it will not in Christianity being
[1:01:41] selfish is not a part of you shouldn't
[1:01:44] be a part of you
[1:01:47] this know also that the last days look
[1:01:49] last days
[1:01:51] all right we're in the last days are we
[1:01:53] not we're in more of the last days and
[1:01:55] even Timothy writing this in second
[1:01:56] Timothy 3 verse 1. perilous time shall
[1:01:59] come for men shall be what lovers of
[1:02:01] their own self what caused perilous
[1:02:03] times there were lovers of their own
[1:02:05] self
[1:02:06] all right Covetous boasters proud
[1:02:08] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:02:10] Unfaithful Unholy do you know what's
[1:02:12] going to happen when the squeeze comes
[1:02:14] and if y'all been reading in the paper
[1:02:16] how that Biden
[1:02:20] is trying to change the currency
[1:02:23] oh yeah
[1:02:24] you know I come out with that Bitcoin
[1:02:25] thing at one time you know but they're
[1:02:27] coming out with a thing now this is Chip
[1:02:32] and they can cut your income off or they
[1:02:35] can add your income here
[1:02:37] hmm
[1:02:39] there'll be a mark brother Brown said
[1:02:41] you won't be able to buy or sell I
[1:02:43] wondered how that could happen when I
[1:02:44] had cash if you put up cash because cash
[1:02:47] is King not when not when it's not
[1:02:49] backed anymore
[1:02:51] when it's not backed anymore you come
[1:02:53] over here and you have to do what
[1:02:56] the Federal Reserve says and the Federal
[1:02:58] Reserve says we're not taking ten dollar
[1:02:59] bills to twenty dollar bills you got to
[1:03:01] take what we give you
[1:03:03] and go to Walmart go to the grocery
[1:03:05] store it's like I told that brother that
[1:03:06] was
[1:03:07] um he was buying gold bars
[1:03:10] and one ounce of gold is like what now
[1:03:12] 1600 something like that I said you got
[1:03:14] one gold bar I said what you're going to
[1:03:16] do you're gonna pull up to the gas
[1:03:17] station and take your knife out and
[1:03:18] shave off
[1:03:19] twenty dollars worth of gold
[1:03:21] no that guy's gonna see that and he's
[1:03:23] going to say your gallon of gas is 1355
[1:03:26] dollars
[1:03:27] and you're gonna have to give me my
[1:03:28] whole bar you're not gonna be able to
[1:03:30] buy a piece off and hand it to him
[1:03:32] see what I mean about silly people
[1:03:33] trying to make it I'm just sorry for
[1:03:35] that brother because you know what he
[1:03:36] was doing all that stuff for too in case
[1:03:38] he didn't make a Rapture he can make it
[1:03:40] to the tribulation boy I don't even want
[1:03:42] to have anything to do
[1:03:44] with making it through the tribulation
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:49] I want to get out of here On Eagle's
[1:03:51] Wings not worry about it building a
[1:03:52] bunker
[1:03:54] you see the other day where those rich
[1:03:56] people are taking those old silos that's
[1:03:58] got the rockets in them and they're
[1:03:59] building layers and they're buying
[1:04:01] layers like millions of dollars a piece
[1:04:03] and that's to make it through a
[1:04:05] holocaust or make it through a uh you
[1:04:07] know disaster
[1:04:09] give me some Eagle wings
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:20] see that and there's no gold that's
[1:04:22] going to save you
[1:04:23] but he will save those that what get in
[1:04:26] the word of God get established don't be
[1:04:29] tossed to brother Brown said listen
[1:04:30] you'll take the mark of the beast and
[1:04:32] you won't even know it isn't that
[1:04:33] correct that what he said he said you'll
[1:04:35] take the mark and you won't even know it
[1:04:36] you'll be in that system and you'll not
[1:04:38] know it till you get in
[1:04:39] wow see that's your foolish virgin
[1:04:43] anybody with me I don't know why I'm
[1:04:45] saying this today but you know what a
[1:04:46] little bit of life lessons don't hurt
[1:04:47] anybody
[1:04:49] so each day I want to live not for
[1:04:51] myself if I live for myself I live a
[1:04:53] selfish life I want to live for others
[1:04:56] and give what strength I have not to
[1:04:57] myself and to my own pleasure but for
[1:05:00] the benefit of others that'll build the
[1:05:02] kingdom of God
[1:05:04] you know when we talk about in our mind
[1:05:08] we we do as human beings
[1:05:12] do unto others as you have them do unto
[1:05:14] you don't work
[1:05:17] oh I I'm sorry I'm sorry today is me it
[1:05:21] don't work for me
[1:05:28] but that's where my war is
[1:05:32] I know to go I know to do good
[1:05:35] didn't Paul say that
[1:05:37] the things I would not I do
[1:05:39] Paul wasn't lost during that whole
[1:05:42] conversation it looks like he was lost
[1:05:44] and he was saved he was lost and he was
[1:05:45] safe now he was a prophet writing the
[1:05:49] Bible he said the things I would not I
[1:05:52] do
[1:05:53] the things I do not I would there's a
[1:05:55] warring in my members not here here yes
[1:06:01] which one I'll let win
[1:06:04] chief
[1:06:05] white dog black dog
[1:06:08] let's don't be selfish because you know
[1:06:10] what when we get in the Statue of
[1:06:11] perfect man that takes all the
[1:06:13] selfishness completely out of the
[1:06:15] picture
[1:06:16] completely out of the picture why did
[1:06:18] ananas and Sapphire have to die because
[1:06:20] they were selfish
[1:06:22] they did not want to give everything
[1:06:25] they had
[1:06:26] to those disciples
[1:06:28] they wanted to hold back a little bit
[1:06:30] for themselves is that all right brother
[1:06:32] Brown said that will continue and be in
[1:06:34] the end time there'll be anodized and
[1:06:36] Sapphire Spirit come among the church
[1:06:38] what you're not giving your all
[1:06:41] and I see it happening now
[1:06:43] you can't give your half you can't give
[1:06:45] your third
[1:06:47] they probably just kept backing up they
[1:06:48] probably thought
[1:06:49] they're not going to miss this
[1:06:52] and they're not going to miss it
[1:06:54] and he got his wife involved and got
[1:06:56] them both killed
[1:06:57] and Paul said Peter said you didn't lie
[1:06:59] to me amen you lied to the Holy Ghost
[1:07:02] so they were in trouble with the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost not with Peter Peter probably in
[1:07:06] his in his Humanity didn't want to do
[1:07:09] what he did
[1:07:10] in his Humanity he didn't want to put
[1:07:12] the curse on them but you got to think
[1:07:14] in your mind see there he had to have a
[1:07:15] mind transformation that it wasn't him
[1:07:17] they were dealing with it was the Holy
[1:07:19] Ghost they were lying to not to Peter
[1:07:24] you can tell you know you can tell me a
[1:07:25] lie and we can deal with it but don't
[1:07:28] lie to God
[1:07:30] do not lie to God because you know what
[1:07:31] he already knows what you what you did
[1:07:34] before you started lying
[1:07:38] to our own selfish beings our own
[1:07:40] ambition
[1:07:41] that we could completely surrender
[1:07:42] ourselves and be yoked to him no matter
[1:07:44] what the rest of the world thinks
[1:07:49] what the rest of the world does we're
[1:07:51] yoked with the Fetters of love we are
[1:07:54] prisoners my feet are so yoked to Christ
[1:07:57] it won't dance my eyes are so yoked to
[1:08:00] Christ amen come on somebody
[1:08:03] tell life when I see these modern
[1:08:05] striptease on the street it turns my
[1:08:07] head my heart is so yoked and loved to
[1:08:09] him till I can't have love for this
[1:08:11] world anymore my will is so yoked to him
[1:08:13] till I don't even know
[1:08:15] what my ambitions are just Wherever You
[1:08:19] Lead I'll follow Lord I will be a
[1:08:24] prisoner Paul a prisoner of Christ
[1:08:28] and everybody knows this quote we have
[1:08:30] to suffer the rain
[1:08:36] you think about
[1:08:37] your life all right just think about
[1:08:39] your life for a minute
[1:08:41] and the things you've had to give up
[1:08:43] since you're as a Christian
[1:08:45] now think about the things you gave up
[1:08:47] before you were a Christian
[1:08:48] you hated to give up stuff
[1:08:51] come on somebody say Amen
[1:08:53] you hated to give it up you
[1:08:55] just up
[1:08:57] but when you become a child of God a
[1:08:59] prisoner to God a prisoner to what the
[1:09:01] heart it was easy for me to give up
[1:09:06] drinking
[1:09:08] smoking cursing you see
[1:09:11] now you say well wait a minute bro wait
[1:09:13] it wasn't easy for me yeah but look at
[1:09:16] you saying here today
[1:09:20] folks listen you can't put your battles
[1:09:23] on me and meme on you and say well you
[1:09:25] need to work it this way
[1:09:29] different to everybody
[1:09:33] nobody with me yeah man all right
[1:09:40] could you what's the worst thing to do
[1:09:42] is
[1:09:44] is you know you work on a situation and
[1:09:47] and not just your wife and Jim doesn't
[1:09:50] do this but you know if you're working
[1:09:51] on a situation and and your wife walks
[1:09:53] up and says well my dad wouldn't have
[1:09:55] handled it that way
[1:09:57] well you talk about righteous
[1:09:58] indignation
[1:10:00] because that Daddy didn't know what
[1:10:01] we're going through
[1:10:03] everybody with me we're all different
[1:10:05] individuals
[1:10:06] and we're yoked together so we need to
[1:10:08] work together I'm telling this for a
[1:10:10] life lesson for all you need to work
[1:10:11] together
[1:10:13] hey ma'am listen put the blame on the
[1:10:16] devil don't put the blame on your spouse
[1:10:19] put it on the Devil he's the one that
[1:10:21] started it he's the author of it but you
[1:10:23] know what God May allowed it for
[1:10:25] something to happen to what to break
[1:10:28] your Fetters yeah
[1:10:30] to make you start loving cats
[1:10:34] when you didn't like him at all
[1:10:38] I'm serious with that though I'm not
[1:10:40] trying to play I'm serious and you all
[1:10:42] know that I really I hate a cat I just
[1:10:44] couldn't stand to look at him
[1:10:47] but now
[1:10:49] I'm probably gonna get one June didn't
[1:10:51] know this she didn't have a clue because
[1:10:53] I didn't want to discuss it with her
[1:10:54] because I knew what happened the devil
[1:10:55] would get involved foreign
[1:11:03] character building
[1:11:05] you shouldn't hate the creatures of God
[1:11:08] now wait a minute when we start talking
[1:11:09] about rats
[1:11:11] roaches
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:15] um Rebecca snakes
[1:11:19] she called me one day and I thought she
[1:11:21] had just absolutely fell out of an
[1:11:23] airplane
[1:11:25] I heard the scream wow
[1:11:30] since Rebecca white was right after Gary
[1:11:31] had passed away and I said oh she has
[1:11:34] done jumped off the
[1:11:35] dropped off the trailer
[1:11:38] he was a snake in her bathtub
[1:11:41] it was a rattlesnake too it was about
[1:11:43] that long but it was it wasn't big
[1:11:45] enough to get over the thing if it would
[1:11:46] have it had gotten her house but she
[1:11:48] would you know how that high voice
[1:11:51] settle down what's going on
[1:11:53] then she finally said snake
[1:11:58] I said okay I'll be there in a minute
[1:12:00] well I thought it was outside she said
[1:12:02] come in I thought we're in trouble now
[1:12:05] let's go back to that back room and he's
[1:12:07] got she got a garden tub you know this
[1:12:09] big I get you call it a garden tub like
[1:12:11] a Jacuzzi type Cub tub thank goodness it
[1:12:13] wasn't shallow
[1:12:15] but we took care of that snake I didn't
[1:12:16] turn him loose outside she wouldn't let
[1:12:18] me she said I want that thing out of
[1:12:20] here in pieces
[1:12:22] I do not want them connected together
[1:12:23] when he leaves this place
[1:12:26] and I say Amen
[1:12:31] but now uh you see what I mean
[1:12:35] foreign
[1:12:39] he would shoot animals for people
[1:12:42] because he was a good Hunter
[1:12:44] you know what God gave him a gift
[1:12:47] let me tell you A Life Lesson here from
[1:12:49] a prophet
[1:12:50] right
[1:12:52] he would shoot animals for people now
[1:12:53] see that's against the law
[1:12:55] now there are certain States I want to
[1:12:57] make it right there are certain States
[1:12:58] and we'll finish right here I'll pick
[1:13:00] this up this afternoon we're not even
[1:13:01] close to memories and conscious
[1:13:02] affection
[1:13:04] but there are certain states that you
[1:13:06] can buy they call a group tag
[1:13:08] where you buy one tag for a bear and
[1:13:10] four people can go and whoever gets to
[1:13:12] Bear first they can use that tag that's
[1:13:14] not where he was hunting at though and
[1:13:16] he would go out and shoot animals for
[1:13:18] him and they would put their tag on you
[1:13:19] know what God said stop it
[1:13:21] hello somebody he didn't get caught by
[1:13:23] the game warden God called him and said
[1:13:26] you stopped that don't do that no more
[1:13:27] why because you bring a reproach what if
[1:13:29] it had got called
[1:13:32] everybody with me what if he hadn't got
[1:13:33] caught by the game warden boy oh boy a
[1:13:36] prophet getting caught by the game ward
[1:13:38] no he got caught by God
[1:13:41] hey man
[1:13:44] you have to suffer the rain the reason
[1:13:46] is this character simply is never made
[1:13:48] without suffering
[1:13:49] characters of Victory not a gift
[1:13:51] a man without character can't Reign what
[1:13:53] is rain rule over
[1:13:56] because power apart from character is
[1:13:58] what we were just talking about anything
[1:14:00] outside of the power God is of Satan
[1:14:02] there's only two Powers that's right
[1:14:04] God's power and Satan's power there's
[1:14:06] only two and remember His is all-knowing
[1:14:09] all doing all Eternal Satan's is
[1:14:11] permitted
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:14] and then she wants to share even his
[1:14:16] throne
[1:14:17] well in other words if you have
[1:14:19] character you it's fit to rule what what
[1:14:21] are you gonna rule over first
[1:14:24] rule over there first Lord
[1:14:27] all right
[1:14:28] but if you rule and what it told us in
[1:14:31] the Book of Revelations
[1:14:32] three about verse 20 something it says
[1:14:35] we will what sit in his throne and reign
[1:14:39] with him in his throne
[1:14:41] as he overcame and sat with his father
[1:14:44] in his throne not on in
[1:14:47] not on in
[1:14:49] all right and since he wants us to share
[1:14:52] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:14:54] he overcame and sat down on his father's
[1:14:55] throne
[1:14:57] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:14:59] overcome what brother random yourself
[1:15:04] well the devil just bothers me you let
[1:15:06] him
[1:15:08] black didn't go over good you let him
[1:15:12] because I'ma read to you in just this
[1:15:14] afternoon where brother around says the
[1:15:16] right mental attitude your mental
[1:15:18] attitude
[1:15:20] not your revelation
[1:15:22] not your how many times you prayed
[1:15:25] with your right mental attitude toward
[1:15:26] any promise of God he'll have to make it
[1:15:28] come to pass
[1:15:30] wow
[1:15:31] let's read this book real quick and then
[1:15:33] we'll close
[1:15:35] I'm talking about gifts of God
[1:15:37] but these gifts of God without these
[1:15:39] virtues in them makes a stumbling block
[1:15:40] to the unbeliever look it's not accepted
[1:15:43] by God he went through all the
[1:15:44] Pentecostals and they were up shouting
[1:15:46] and speaking in tongues jumping up
[1:15:48] um you see on the
[1:15:50] um on the screen the other day
[1:15:52] he was
[1:15:53] speaking and somebody spoke in tongues
[1:15:55] and interpreted it wasn't two sentences
[1:15:57] later somebody jumped up and spoke in
[1:15:59] tongues and interpreted he he was
[1:16:01] gracious to stop but remember he goes
[1:16:03] over and says all right Brown
[1:16:04] Tabernacles that's gonna be kids anymore
[1:16:06] you take these tongues and gifts and you
[1:16:08] put them in the back room you do that
[1:16:10] before the service starts don't do it
[1:16:11] while the service is going on remember
[1:16:13] all right
[1:16:14] but it's not accepted by God this has to
[1:16:17] be first and when you have faith virtual
[1:16:19] knowledge temperations Godless brotherly
[1:16:20] kindness brotherly love then the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit
[1:16:25] the same as he seals the church ages as
[1:16:27] a unit the way he makes his bride is the
[1:16:30] way he makes his individual made out of
[1:16:32] the same material like Eve was made out
[1:16:35] of Adam listen there was no denying
[1:16:37] that's why Adam couldn't destroy Eve
[1:16:41] as we said Sunday
[1:16:43] Eve didn't sell us out folks
[1:16:47] Adam sold us out
[1:16:51] but he was she was so much him she said
[1:16:54] if if she's still gonna die I Gotta Die
[1:16:57] you know what Christ said he took our
[1:16:59] judgment he said she's going to die I'm
[1:17:01] going to die for him but see he could
[1:17:03] come back and be the Redeemer Adam could
[1:17:05] not Adam could have love for his wife
[1:17:08] and and shelter and say God you gotta
[1:17:11] take me didn't know what he did with
[1:17:12] Moses and now what he did with different
[1:17:15] ones God you got to tell you not I
[1:17:16] believe that's what brother Brown did he
[1:17:17] didn't do it on him on a tape but I
[1:17:19] believe brother Brown would get along
[1:17:20] with God and he said God
[1:17:22] said look I'm gonna wipe in Pentecostals
[1:17:24] off to their their no good they've
[1:17:26] stopped loving me I'm gonna wipe them
[1:17:28] off I believe brother said Lord
[1:17:30] if you take them you got to take me
[1:17:32] coach he had the same attitude
[1:17:34] if you take them you got to take me Paul
[1:17:36] stood up with those Corinthians he said
[1:17:38] y'all are whoremongers your man remember
[1:17:40] that whole list of things in Corinthians
[1:17:42] y'all were all these things
[1:17:45] and search for some of you
[1:17:47] but you're washed in other words God
[1:17:49] didn't give up on you your church age
[1:17:51] Master didn't give up on you and God's
[1:17:53] not giving up going to give up on you
[1:17:54] your pastor's not gonna give up on you
[1:17:56] amen here's the things you can have
[1:17:59] first you can't impersonate them you
[1:18:01] can't imitate them you've got they've
[1:18:03] got to be what God sent and God born
[1:18:06] imitation only causes confusion
[1:18:10] listen to me imitation only causes
[1:18:14] confusion
[1:18:16] right
[1:18:21] we know this is a requirement magicians
[1:18:23] come
[1:18:25] this is a requirement
[1:18:27] if you're going to sit in this building
[1:18:28] today it's your requirement to live by
[1:18:31] the word of God
[1:18:32] it's my requirement to live by the word
[1:18:34] of God every word that proceedeth
[1:18:36] thousand miles of God Amen and we fall
[1:18:38] and we fail but guess what there's a
[1:18:41] provision there when we do
