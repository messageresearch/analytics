[7:05] that 50 announcements that everybody
[7:08] maybe we'll get on the internet with it
[7:10] and knows there'd be some watching on
[7:12] the internet because anyway you know
[7:15] can get everything together on that amen
[7:18] but if you'd like turning to I've
[7:21] already preached this three times so
[7:22] this will be the fourth time
[7:24] so I'm gonna try to do like an
[7:26] evangelist you know you can eventually
[7:27] he's got it made he just travels around
[7:30] the country and he's got one message and
[7:32] he just preaches it everywhere he goes
[7:34] you know then he has to keep up with it
[7:36] well this will be the fourth time and I
[7:38] want to speak on this so uh you know be
[7:41] different scripture a little different
[7:42] approach but I spoke on this at Wichita
[7:47] Kansas week before last on Sunday and
[7:51] then spoke on at brother claude's on
[7:54] Wednesday night of uh you know this past
[7:56] Wednesday on basically the same subject
[8:00] but if you'd like to turn in your
[8:02] scriptures turn to Joshua 10
[8:05] in Hebrews 1. Joshua 10 Hebrews 1 I just
[8:10] thought there was so much to be covered
[8:12] and we're not counting this in so don't
[8:15] get your numbers mixed up we're not
[8:17] counting this in the series on where
[8:19] we're speaking on on perfect our
[8:22] Perfection but this is an in-shot
[8:24] message to try to explain a few things
[8:26] and uh you know we just put it in anyway
[8:29] so we go to Joshua 10 and Hebrews
[8:33] father we thank you for this day and
[8:35] your grace unto us we thank you for the
[8:38] hour that we have upon the Earth and we
[8:40] pray that you would just bless us now
[8:41] with your presence and understanding
[8:44] that Lord that we may speak what you
[8:46] have to be said unto us
[8:48] that you come Among Us and reveal
[8:50] yourself
[8:52] you said you sent your word and healed
[8:54] us so we believe it tonight that Lord if
[8:57] we just accept what's being said that we
[8:59] can be delivered right where we're
[9:01] sitting not have any problems and and
[9:04] Lord to just walk in you we love you and
[9:06] we thank you bless each one Lord as we
[9:08] come up to this truly a great
[9:10] Thanksgiving time that Lord we are very
[9:13] very thankful for the Newfound way as
[9:17] the prophet said the the the ones who
[9:20] came over were proud to find a new way
[9:22] of religion and Lord we've not found a
[9:25] new way of religion we found the oldest
[9:27] religion that has ever been and we're
[9:30] just rejoicing in that and we're truly
[9:32] having a Thanksgiving in our hearts we
[9:35] love you and we thank you forgive our
[9:36] sins
[9:37] cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord
[9:40] sanctifies in you that we may walk in
[9:43] the light of Your Love in Jesus name
[9:49] they all seem to enjoy
[9:52] these things that we spoke on and you
[9:55] know
[9:56] so you can watch the one especially from
[9:58] Brother Pinkston if you want to pull it
[10:00] up it's not it's on the internet if
[10:02] you're going to watch it man
[10:05] Joshua 10 verse 12. then expect Joshua
[10:08] to the Lord
[10:10] in the day when the Lord delivered up
[10:12] the amorites before the children of
[10:14] Israel
[10:15] and he said in the Sabbath and he said
[10:17] in the side of Israel son stand thou
[10:20] still upon gibeon and thou moon in the
[10:23] valley of agilon and the sun Stood Still
[10:26] In the moon State until the people had
[10:28] Avenged themselves upon their enemies
[10:30] it's not just written in the Book of
[10:33] Joshua so the son stood still in the
[10:35] midst of Heaven and the hasted not to go
[10:38] down about a whole day and there was no
[10:40] day like that day before it or after it
[10:43] that the Lord hearkened them to the
[10:46] voice of a man for the Lord fought for
[10:49] Israel now we'll go over to Hebrews
[10:52] one everybody knows this one
[10:58] God who at Sunder at times and in
[11:00] diverse manner striking times paste unto
[11:04] the father's by or what are in the
[11:06] prophets now what happened these last
[11:09] days spoken unto us were in
[11:13] or by his son whom he at the pointed
[11:15] there of All Things by whom also he made
[11:17] the world you may be seated the Lord had
[11:21] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[11:23] now
[11:26] remember the the background a few weeks
[11:28] ago when we were talking about the
[11:30] atonement and uh you know you can go
[11:33] ahead and pull up Exodus 32 there
[11:36] brother Joe and we'll we'll read it and
[11:39] uh because that was where we were
[11:41] dealing with it
[11:42] and uh just looking at the the
[11:46] scriptures
[11:47] and seeing that you know that God
[11:51] the great create part
[11:54] all right the great creator
[11:57] okay now
[12:00] he created all things
[12:02] right right world life and things like
[12:06] that you know letting our visitor back
[12:08] there with us so we always say when
[12:11] you're visiting here you come one time
[12:13] your visitor you come two times you're
[12:15] part of us so we're glad to have you
[12:17] with us tonight amen all right just feel
[12:20] comfortable in the Lord
[12:22] but now God created the world
[12:27] all right
[12:28] but then when he began to
[12:31] um
[12:33] do you know in in the world coming on
[12:35] down through time
[12:37] he started using man amen because you
[12:40] remember there in the scriptures one
[12:42] time the you know they said don't let
[12:44] God Speak
[12:46] said let you go Moses get What God Says
[12:49] bring it to us we'll do it all right and
[12:53] as it was done then see then God would
[12:56] use man to do things
[12:58] and when he would be in the writing of
[13:00] the word he used man in the writing of
[13:02] the word
[13:03] right and that's God's word and and you
[13:06] know he's the one that's that's LED as
[13:08] we we say you know well the Bible is
[13:10] just what a man wrote down
[13:13] well you know that's true
[13:15] a man wrote it down
[13:17] but that man see was led that we read
[13:21] during Hebrews
[13:23] by the Holy Spirit
[13:25] to write the word
[13:27] all right
[13:30] he was led to say what he said right
[13:33] like Isaiah would say a virgin she'll
[13:36] conceive now what probably like the the
[13:38] prophet or people have said you know on
[13:39] his way home maybe he thought you know
[13:41] my Lord what did I say you know I said
[13:44] something in this impossible the Virgin
[13:45] still can see
[13:47] but see it was the word of God all right
[13:50] and the Bible is full of the the things
[13:53] the the nuggets as we look at of doing
[13:56] it and and seeing that it would be those
[13:59] prophets would be led by the spirit of
[14:01] God to speak his word
[14:05] and like I've always told you you know
[14:07] uh we read things in there and we we
[14:10] wonder maybe sometimes how they happen
[14:13] you know but Abraham you know in the
[14:18] slaughter of the Kings and to bring him
[14:19] back into things and he said Lord said
[14:22] to him
[14:23] we'll give you 10 percent
[14:25] well why didn't he say 80 or 90 or 40 or
[14:29] 30 percent or
[14:31] I mean why did he say 10 then we come on
[14:35] over see and we pay our tithes and we we
[14:38] do things like that because we're we're
[14:39] counting that as being what Abraham saw
[14:43] and uh in doing that why didn't
[14:46] he says some other number
[14:48] because he picked up the mind of God
[14:51] right see that would be written in the
[14:54] word the Bible before the world because
[14:55] we read in the Bible there that the you
[14:58] know the lamb stood strain before the
[15:00] foundation of the world
[15:01] so if there is never wish to be a Bible
[15:03] or anything to come down it couldn't be
[15:06] anything different than God had in his
[15:07] mind in the original right right so then
[15:10] it would be ten percent all right and
[15:14] that would be the same for listening
[15:16] brother Stephen Wilson today on him
[15:18] talking about how the
[15:20] um Ella easer went down to get uh Isaac
[15:22] a bride and if you'll remember Ella
[15:25] easer when he got there he was supposed
[15:27] to go down to the kin folks
[15:29] but he was still concerned
[15:31] and everything and when he got down
[15:33] there he said now Lord
[15:35] he said in other words paraphrase in
[15:37] scripture I'm going to sit down here
[15:38] about as well
[15:41] and you let the one that's supposed to
[15:43] be Isaacs right come out here and draw
[15:46] water
[15:47] and said let her give me some water and
[15:50] said didn't let her water the camels
[15:51] right
[15:53] we'll see what was he saying
[15:56] he was speaking the word of God right
[15:59] right because what he was doing was
[16:01] picking up the thought
[16:03] because as those prophets would write
[16:05] the word and the things they would do
[16:07] they would they would pick that thought
[16:10] up you remember we were talking about
[16:12] Moses it's in the seal book there where
[16:14] he said that it was first God's talk
[16:18] he said that it was given to Moses you
[16:21] know what it was Moses thought he said
[16:23] it's not the word yet
[16:26] he said then Moses went out and spoke it
[16:29] he said then it became the word right
[16:31] see and God has used man to write the
[16:34] word by transmitting his thought down
[16:38] through them to where they would pin it
[16:40] out and and the things would happen
[16:42] throughout the whole Bible and it would
[16:45] turn out to be the word of God
[16:47] so then he can say well man said well
[16:49] it's just a man wrote it well that's all
[16:51] right I don't have no problem right
[16:54] but that man was little God right right
[16:57] he would let the Lord to write it and a
[17:01] lot of times he would say thus saith the
[17:03] Lord
[17:04] you know he prophets right well I what
[17:07] did that mean
[17:09] that meant that God was borrowing a
[17:12] voice
[17:14] to speak right
[17:17] the God was using the man transmitting
[17:20] his thought down through him and then he
[17:22] would speak it out
[17:24] and he would say thus saith the Lord in
[17:27] other words the Lord's telling me to say
[17:28] this
[17:29] but if you notice Jesus never did say
[17:31] the same to the Lord
[17:33] because he was the Lord amen what he was
[17:36] speaking was the word of God but those
[17:38] prophets were being led to bring the
[17:40] word of God into being or the Bible as
[17:42] we call it whatever you want to go with
[17:44] it and that they would be doing that it
[17:47] would be God speaking to us personally
[17:50] through those people all right now we
[17:53] read that in Joshua
[17:56] that
[17:58] if the voice of a man the Bible said
[18:00] about verse 14 now at the voice of a man
[18:05] God heard a man say
[18:08] you know Joshua said
[18:10] unto the Lord we read that in verse
[18:12] about 10.
[18:15] Joshua spoke to the Lord and when the
[18:18] Lord speaking to Joshua
[18:20] it was Joshua speaking to the Lord all
[18:22] right now
[18:24] but what we went through now I want you
[18:27] to make sure you get the background of
[18:28] it because the the Bible there says that
[18:32] just that day right after that day it's
[18:34] never been a day that God's used a voice
[18:36] in other words it looks like that's the
[18:38] only time it happened
[18:39] that's what I'm sitting up there on a
[18:41] deer stand I thought well I need to
[18:42] explain that because
[18:43] and let's look a little confusing
[18:45] because
[18:47] you know he says it never before or
[18:49] Never After
[18:51] well that doesn't mean that God never
[18:52] spoke to anybody else
[18:55] he couldn't be referring that because he
[18:57] spoke through Moses
[18:59] right he spoke through all the prophets
[19:01] so it's it has to be referring to that
[19:04] specific pain
[19:06] right you know the never before or Never
[19:09] After was the son standing still right
[19:11] it has to be referring to that because
[19:14] if not then you're going to make the
[19:15] Bible come true
[19:17] because you're going to go over it's
[19:18] Moses is going to speak
[19:20] and you remember there in Exodus 32
[19:22] where we were we're using it how that
[19:25] Moses said you know if you're going to
[19:27] do anything block my name out right
[19:32] and God should
[19:34] I I won't I won't block her I walked
[19:38] stop them from going
[19:40] but remember they didn't get to go to
[19:42] the promised land right he said I'll
[19:45] deal with them which is you go on with
[19:46] him right now
[19:48] and you go on and head towards the land
[19:50] and I'll deal with them later
[19:53] but the prophet of God said he wondered
[19:55] how that Moses could tell God a better
[19:58] way of doing something
[19:59] uh
[20:00] you know God comes down you're going to
[20:02] kill him
[20:04] Moses stands up throws himself in the
[20:06] breach
[20:08] and when he throws himself into the
[20:09] breach between you know God and man
[20:14] the prophet said
[20:16] God chose Moses
[20:18] you remember I gave you the quote
[20:20] and said God could not go over Moses
[20:26] because he chose him for the job
[20:29] right
[20:32] I wish I could just do what he wouldn't
[20:34] know if God chooses you for a job you're
[20:37] you're going to do the job are you going
[20:39] to face a lot of consequences right you
[20:41] know when Moses did face a lot of things
[20:43] but still he did do it well you remember
[20:46] we were bringing out the scriptures
[20:48] there and how that Moses as he's
[20:50] explaining over later in the scriptures
[20:52] and numbers
[20:54] that
[20:55] let's see you still got an exodus anyhow
[20:58] let's cover that part and then we'll go
[21:00] on you remember the point that we were
[21:01] bringing about in Exodus
[21:03] what was the atonement that Moses made
[21:07] he said pre-adventure I'll go up and I
[21:10] that I may make an atonement
[21:12] what was the atonement that he made
[21:16] it doesn't list any animal there to be
[21:18] sacrificed
[21:21] all right and atonement there's recovery
[21:24] and all can be in many ways you'll find
[21:26] in numbers uh 16 14 16
[21:30] 47. that
[21:32] um
[21:34] God told Aaron
[21:36] the plague was falling and God told
[21:39] Aaron said go among the people
[21:41] take the sensor
[21:44] and make an atonement
[21:48] and it said the pledge were stayed
[21:51] what did Aaron use the sensor but he was
[21:55] using the words of Moses
[21:57] and what happened in Exodus 32.
[22:01] Moses went before God and said if you
[22:04] block them out block me out too
[22:07] the words of a man
[22:09] and God heard him aren't you'll find on
[22:12] over later that when he's saying it in
[22:15] the scripture let's see if I can find
[22:17] that other one
[22:20] I don't want to get all these scriptures
[22:21] in and then we'll try to get back to a
[22:23] point
[22:24] hmm
[22:27] yeah look at uh look at numbers 14 there
[22:30] what we got
[22:34] and look what happened now this is
[22:35] another case that's happening with Moses
[22:38] and this is really the one that brother
[22:40] Branham is using in his references in
[22:42] the scripture but look what he said
[22:44] heart and Moses said I received Thee the
[22:46] iniquity of this people according unto
[22:49] the greatness of thy mercy as thou Hast
[22:51] forgiven this people from Egypt even
[22:54] until now in other words you've been
[22:56] putting up with them all if you're going
[22:57] down a couple of verses I don't need to
[22:58] use it but if you're going down a couple
[23:00] of verses you'll find said they sin ten
[23:02] times
[23:03] but look what God Said and the Lord said
[23:06] I have pardoned
[23:08] according
[23:11] to Thy Word
[23:14] I have pardoned according to Thy Word
[23:19] the words of a man
[23:22] but now who is that man
[23:26] when he said I have pardoned
[23:28] according to Thy Word
[23:31] I said I don't understand in this you
[23:33] know the scripture for just rolling and
[23:35] I thought well I need to speak on this
[23:36] when I go back home maybe and I spoke
[23:38] out there a few times on it and just
[23:40] jumped about and doing but what about
[23:42] God pardoning according to a man right
[23:46] at the words of a man right
[23:49] guard would pardon
[23:53] what about brother Brown
[23:55] speaking of the grace of marriage and
[23:57] divorce
[23:58] what about the Apostle Paul that gave a
[24:00] Grace of marriage
[24:02] what about Moses that gave a Grace of
[24:05] marriage endure
[24:09] would that not be
[24:12] hardening at the word of a man
[24:15] would that not be a man speaking
[24:21] was not in a man that said
[24:23] going as you are
[24:25] I say
[24:27] report in Corinthians
[24:30] he said the law says this but I say
[24:34] right the words of a man the voice of a
[24:37] man right
[24:39] now if we could believe this is my point
[24:41] that I I want to emphasize to you
[24:43] tonight
[24:44] if we could believe that God used man
[24:48] to write the Bible
[24:51] you know and there's no contradictions
[24:53] in it everybody says there is but I'd
[24:55] like to see one right
[25:01] but at the words of a man could write a
[25:03] book so big as we have it 66 books and
[25:06] you know
[25:08] all the different authors that wrote it
[25:12] and yet not a contradiction in it it
[25:14] would have to be God using those men
[25:16] well truly if we could believe that God
[25:20] would write the word
[25:25] then wouldn't it be I mean should it be
[25:27] hard to believe
[25:29] the words of a man
[25:31] if we believe that man was speaking to
[25:34] us the word of God
[25:36] but there's a choice we have to make
[25:38] right right we can believe that the
[25:41] Apostle Paul taught God's word
[25:44] but see that's the way everybody ought
[25:46] you know everybody they're like this
[25:48] they could be Paul said it Peter said it
[25:51] John said it you know Jesus said it but
[25:53] we don't know about this William Brown
[25:55] we all talk about right
[25:57] well I don't know no problems you don't
[25:59] have to worry about it
[26:01] just don't make fun of it just go on
[26:03] right and believe right
[26:06] what you see my point is if we can
[26:09] believe that God used man to write the
[26:12] word
[26:14] why can't we believe that God used man
[26:16] to bring us to work right amen
[26:20] what should be our problem
[26:24] I know the prophet said it's hard to get
[26:26] one man to believe another man that's
[26:27] true
[26:29] but are we trying to believe the man or
[26:32] are we trying to believe that God is
[26:34] speaking through the man come on Amen
[26:36] now which way
[26:38] it was man in the Bible that I heard his
[26:40] name was Balaam all right false prophet
[26:43] caused Israel to fall
[26:46] all kind of things
[26:49] but you know what
[26:51] what God led him to say is in this Bible
[26:57] but Balaam had to say
[27:00] is in this Bible
[27:02] a false prophet
[27:04] he said I can't say nothing except what
[27:08] God tells me
[27:13] and that's even that the words of a man
[27:16] you're going to tear out that
[27:18] that road
[27:21] and his prophecy of Israel
[27:24] no
[27:26] we can't like to be the word of God
[27:28] because it was the truth
[27:30] now the other things that he brought out
[27:33] wouldn't be the truth
[27:36] and everybody that speaks don't speak
[27:38] true
[27:39] the Bible says that
[27:40] he said people will say things
[27:42] presumptuously that I didn't tell them
[27:44] in other words
[27:46] but what about the words of a man that I
[27:49] gave it to you and make their own the
[27:50] message
[27:51] and and brother random said it like this
[27:55] he said Moses actually said over in the
[27:58] numbers account there and you know one
[27:59] of an exodus he's saying you know about
[28:01] my name but over in numbers
[28:05] he says
[28:09] the people will say read right back up
[28:11] above where we were there in numbers
[28:14] did the people will say that God is able
[28:16] to bring these people out
[28:18] but not able to take them in
[28:21] he just brought him out here where he
[28:23] could destroy him
[28:24] we don't that's an odd statement because
[28:28] you know
[28:30] if God could bring them out of Egypt
[28:35] and would it be a problem
[28:37] for to do the other half and take them
[28:39] in
[28:40] right I mean but that's the way man
[28:42] speaks and that's what Moses said to God
[28:45] said the people will say
[28:47] if you destroy him out here said the
[28:49] people will say
[28:52] mine was able to bring him out he wasn't
[28:54] able to take him in
[28:56] and says you promised it
[29:00] and you know what brother random I gave
[29:01] you the quotes well be glad to give them
[29:03] to you if you want them but he said
[29:05] Moses wrote the word
[29:08] of God
[29:10] back in his face
[29:14] said you said
[29:16] you were going to take him into the land
[29:22] said you promised it
[29:26] Moses was just reminding god of what he
[29:29] said
[29:31] is not that what we're supposed to do
[29:36] if we need salvation according to Romans
[29:38] we believe in her heart and confess with
[29:40] our mouths
[29:41] the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:43] and he'll save us amen
[29:46] repeat it wouldn't be baptized in the
[29:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus
[29:50] Christ versus the scripture
[29:51] and you shall receive the gift of the
[29:53] Holy Ghost
[29:56] that scripture
[29:58] right my stripes we were healed that's
[30:01] scripture
[30:06] if you find a promise in the Bible
[30:09] what's the problem with calling God on
[30:10] the scene to answer that promise right
[30:12] right amen right why did he say it if he
[30:16] didn't mean it
[30:17] well he didn't mean it in that case well
[30:19] now who are you
[30:22] another word's a peanut brain like you
[30:25] and I that's the best way of saying it
[30:26] for all of us
[30:27] compared to the prophets and writers of
[30:30] the word
[30:31] and we take our peanut brain
[30:34] and we say God didn't mean that
[30:38] you see where would they have been back
[30:40] there if they have not believed God
[30:42] spoke to them
[30:48] you know what it in the scripture there
[30:50] it says as I was with Moses speaking to
[30:52] Joshua I'll be with you
[30:57] we know Moses had a burning bush and an
[30:59] experience of saying pull off your shoes
[31:03] unless you're standing on Holy Ground
[31:04] Rick Joshua about one beginning over
[31:07] there
[31:08] and see if Joshua he didn't need a
[31:11] burning bush
[31:15] he met the god of the bush
[31:18] he said are you fires or against us he
[31:20] said I'm not taking sides with nobody he
[31:22] said I'm the captain of the Lord's host
[31:25] take off your shoes
[31:27] he had an experience
[31:31] with God
[31:32] what about you and I
[31:35] we actually had an experience with God
[31:37] to where he's real to us
[31:40] or is he just some kind of a thought or
[31:43] an ideal and then could we come up and
[31:44] say well man wrote this we don't know
[31:46] where to believe it or not well you know
[31:47] that's where not funny but he said well
[31:49] God a man wrote the Bible I said hey
[31:51] you're right
[31:53] I got enough sense to know somebody
[31:55] pinned it right
[31:59] because see a lot of people say no that
[32:01] ain't right God wrote it they only know
[32:02] what you're talking about
[32:05] you see God LED mankind to write this
[32:07] book
[32:08] to bring it into us
[32:10] God LED Martin Luther
[32:13] you're preacher matches you're the judge
[32:15] you'll live by faith a lot of people
[32:17] protested the Catholic Church before
[32:20] Martin Luther came along
[32:22] but none of them had it right in the
[32:24] scriptural line and was called to God
[32:27] for the hour
[32:29] sure he was a trinitarian jury he's
[32:32] sitting a pub and drink beer and smoked
[32:34] a pipe and talked about the Bible
[32:37] again it was God's man that's right
[32:40] amen he was used to God to bring that
[32:43] back unto us
[32:45] John Wesley was used to bring
[32:48] sanctification
[32:49] back into the church
[32:55] extreme the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:58] came in jewson Street in 1906.
[33:02] a great prophet in the Bible I mean the
[33:05] prophet of God said
[33:07] the prophet came
[33:08] amen God himself came in those gifts
[33:13] we had people don't want to have nothing
[33:14] to do with gifts
[33:17] but you see it was a word being restored
[33:20] again
[33:21] because even though we talk about the
[33:23] Bible that we read it
[33:25] George said they can't can wear Palmer
[33:28] wearing Locust caterpillar we'd eat it
[33:30] down
[33:32] but he said it'd be restored he said
[33:34] four restoration of Bright Tree and a
[33:37] lot of times sitting right there in
[33:37] Kansas I get up every morning wake get
[33:40] up five o'clock and after I get my dear
[33:42] we I still get up with him and we'd eat
[33:44] breakfast together and pray and and he'd
[33:47] go out and Hunt I'd lay down on the bed
[33:49] and put my iPod in my ears and laid out
[33:52] our sleep and listen and sleep and
[33:54] listen and you know then I get up about
[33:56] 7 30 and I just walk and pray and listen
[33:58] to tapes and just
[34:00] I've listened to the restoration of the
[34:02] broad tree you know where the prophets
[34:03] explain it four messengers of death
[34:05] can't one problem with Locust
[34:06] caterpillar I ate it down he said before
[34:08] massive years of life what
[34:10] Luther Wesley and of course
[34:13] and the end time with the word
[34:15] do you even though we could talk about
[34:17] that man brought us this Bible
[34:20] you know we can say this is God's word
[34:25] but something has to be made personal
[34:28] about it or otherwise it's just words on
[34:31] a page all right that's right amen thank
[34:33] you
[34:34] it's just words on the page if that
[34:37] doesn't come off the page into your
[34:38] heart
[34:40] you see that's why there had to be a
[34:42] time that that had to be restored and
[34:44] the life was the word to be restored to
[34:46] us
[34:48] and then the prophet would stand there
[34:49] and say why would you struggle that
[34:52] squirrels being spoken into existence
[34:55] stormed that things out salvation comes
[34:59] and
[35:00] he said when we believe that under the
[35:01] blood of bulls and goats Moses could
[35:03] speak Flash fleeks and frogs right
[35:07] but see do we believe in the same God
[35:09] come on
[35:12] tell me that God is still speaking amen
[35:15] him
[35:19] and he pardoned Israel at the works of a
[35:22] man right
[35:25] why can't we believe he pardoned
[35:28] through Moses he pardoned to Paul
[35:33] why can't we believe all of it's been a
[35:35] part you know what uh what Martin Luther
[35:37] offered
[35:38] a pardon
[35:41] right
[35:43] Martin Luther offered a pardon for sin
[35:46] but they just shall live by faith right
[35:48] man
[35:50] John Westby offered a pardon
[35:52] sanctification
[35:56] cleansing and setting us aside for
[35:58] service
[35:59] Zeus's Street offered a pardon at the
[36:02] words of a man right you know what
[36:04] happened on the sushi Street
[36:06] you know what the man started there in
[36:08] Kansas we were talking about it the
[36:09] other day we happened to see it on the
[36:11] video and the brother was bringing it
[36:12] back to me you know that um what's his
[36:15] name
[36:16] Seymour Seymour actually started in
[36:18] Kansas and went from Kansas to Texas
[36:21] from Texas to California
[36:23] and uh started to
[36:25] the mission there you know
[36:29] but a pardon was offered those people
[36:32] at the words of a man
[36:35] a man preached that the gifts was there
[36:37] again
[36:38] and they believed it that's right what
[36:41] do you count this message to me come on
[36:43] you know what I counted to be a pardon
[36:45] Amen brother
[36:49] God used a man to bring us a message
[36:51] that's right yeah the message is my
[36:54] pardon amen right man
[36:57] I
[36:59] if I believe God spoke through the man
[37:05] she said he's speaking to me that's why
[37:07] I love that scripture behold I sinned
[37:12] Garrisonville
[37:13] you say that in the Bible
[37:16] the Brandon found it doesn't say that in
[37:19] the Bible
[37:20] the behold I send you Elijah right amen
[37:24] right do you accept to me
[37:27] amen
[37:29] call for me a pardon amen a revealed
[37:33] word amen
[37:35] an opening of the word that I could look
[37:37] at and read and find myself right
[37:40] land within that word
[37:43] at the words of a man
[37:47] that's why I was trying to thinking
[37:49] about that see
[37:50] because they're in Joshua it looks like
[37:52] that God would never use man again if
[37:54] you really read that that way because he
[37:57] would never use the voice of the land so
[37:58] I said before our after
[38:01] Lord that ain't right right but I always
[38:04] use man to speak right right
[38:08] we went back to the message that
[38:09] pre-silver and
[38:12] Moses and then the scriptures begin to
[38:14] un Oh I thought when that one of the
[38:17] numbers there Lord that there's
[38:18] something about that I go back and get
[38:20] my Bible
[38:22] and read it he said at the word to a man
[38:26] I'll pardon you
[38:33] listen folks
[38:35] I told Brother Jim
[38:38] I said I'm not a Trophy Hunter come on
[38:42] I like to do yeah
[38:45] the only pleasure they ever do maybe
[38:47] fish them
[38:50] but you know what
[38:52] I ain't always wrong
[38:54] right
[38:56] 9 seconds Listen to Three tapes while
[38:58] I'm sitting on deer stand
[39:02] I don't see why you couldn't get your
[39:04] knockout stick in your pocket do your
[39:06] work
[39:14] but you see I'm listening because I want
[39:16] to know what the man has to say
[39:19] because I believe that God was using the
[39:21] man to speak right
[39:25] he brought us the word of God
[39:30] I don't believe he stopped speaking
[39:33] when the profit went off the same right
[39:35] right
[39:38] I thought we believe in the file former
[39:40] industry dealers were farther protecting
[39:42] other states right
[39:46] I thought we believe that God was still
[39:48] speaking through the Firefall industry
[39:50] right right yeah and the people
[39:53] if you don't believe that why are you
[39:54] going to jerk
[39:57] I didn't save you a lot of trouble once
[39:59] you stay at home he said well I said be
[40:01] a star cat I didn't sarcastic that's the
[40:02] only God's on his truth
[40:05] if you don't believe that God is
[40:06] speaking through the ministry here in
[40:08] the church why do you come
[40:11] right well you got nothing else to do
[40:21] but why can't we believe God is still
[40:22] sick
[40:24] a divorce of a man
[40:28] who said we could believe the prophet
[40:30] would speak
[40:32] and he would tell us what God had to say
[40:33] all right
[40:36] but if a five-fold Ministry tells you
[40:38] the same thing the prophet said
[40:41] and who's doing the speaking because
[40:43] that was the whole point I've tried to
[40:44] make for three services and this one I'm
[40:47] trying to make
[40:48] my brother Brown said it was Moses it
[40:51] was not Moses he said it was Christ in
[40:53] Moses amen right amen all right my Bible
[40:56] said if the mind of Christ being you
[41:00] my Bible said he's Hebrews 13 8.
[41:04] amen
[41:05] and that's what I was trying to express
[41:07] while ago about it that when Abraham
[41:09] picked that thought up
[41:11] see
[41:13] and spoken
[41:15] Moses picked that thought up do we think
[41:17] Moses was just walking around he said
[41:19] Aaron okay let's get some flies get some
[41:22] please
[41:26] what's wrong
[41:28] now he picked up the thought of God
[41:30] right you're right and Joshua seen the
[41:34] battle if you remember reading the
[41:35] scriptures they had kind of busted him
[41:37] up and they were scattered but he knew
[41:39] if they got back together that that
[41:41] created a lot of problems
[41:45] he picked up the dog of what was needed
[41:49] what was needed some stand still
[41:57] where did he get that thought
[41:59] oh
[42:00] okay it was not that the mind of Christ
[42:03] amen
[42:05] speaking through Joshua come on
[42:08] you say yeah but but brother Dale the
[42:10] images should be put on the man that
[42:12] done the speaking no you got to put the
[42:15] instance on the one that's doing the
[42:16] speaking through the man
[42:18] right then it's the words of a man right
[42:20] because what if Joshua hadn't said it
[42:23] right it never happened it wouldn't have
[42:25] took place
[42:26] yeah that's right there's the point
[42:30] see if Moses hadn't said it
[42:33] he could sit back over the side and said
[42:35] Lord
[42:37] I tell you now don't don't do that no
[42:39] more no no no he had to get up and say
[42:41] it
[42:44] when he got up spoke it then that was
[42:46] Christ
[42:48] God has always been Christ in all the
[42:50] men that spoke it it was Christ and
[42:53] around him that told us the grace of
[42:54] marriage and divorce he was not William
[42:56] Bradham
[42:58] right
[42:59] it was God speaking through the voice of
[43:01] a man one says in the days of the voice
[43:04] of the seventh angel
[43:07] the defend the days of the man
[43:11] this way you can't separate the man in
[43:13] the voice well that's true
[43:18] but man can say things that's not right
[43:22] but God can't
[43:25] remember I gave you the quote there
[43:28] when I was reading it before that
[43:29] brother Brown said if God promised it
[43:32] God is obligated to keep his word
[43:36] amen so this is not Independence upon
[43:40] William Brown
[43:42] a man
[43:44] he's not built on the fifo ministry
[43:47] of Samuel Dale and and whoever would be
[43:50] in that Ministry
[43:53] it's whether or not it's not whether
[43:55] God's been using them to speak
[43:59] because the Bible says they speak
[44:00] presumptuously
[44:06] and they'll say the Lord told me
[44:10] even though these preachers say Hello
[44:12] Lord told me
[44:14] you ever notice the way I say it a lot
[44:16] of time
[44:17] that something told me right
[44:21] if it don't come to pass
[44:24] I got enough sense to know it would not
[44:26] right that's right but if it comes to
[44:29] price I got enough sense to know it
[44:31] wouldn't mean right
[44:37] all right
[44:38] Choice the voice of a man
[44:42] this is in you sisters and and you
[44:45] laughed him right to take them down to
[44:47] your children
[44:51] and to teach those children and and you
[44:54] know
[44:55] the younger the older the younger and I
[44:57] like that
[44:59] because you become the voice of God
[45:04] a dumb donkey told a prophet one day
[45:08] they expected to get killed if he didn't
[45:09] cut it out right right
[45:19] thank you
[45:21] all right
[45:26] it's divorce
[45:28] that we're talking about right
[45:30] the force of a man
[45:33] the man that's speaking is the Lord
[45:36] himself
[45:38] if those prophets could say thus saith
[45:41] the Lord that God could use them
[45:46] you notice right around him when he
[45:47] comes down to Sister Hattie right
[45:50] where he spoke to her about her children
[45:51] I believe I'm pretty sure that's one
[45:54] then he said
[45:56] you know she said unto him said that
[45:58] ain't nothing but the truth
[46:00] he said you say whatever you have need
[46:02] of and it'll be given unto you right
[46:04] amen right I say unto you
[46:07] go check that and I'm pretty sure that's
[46:08] one he seems she didn't catch it he said
[46:11] sister that is the saith the Lord why
[46:13] because she's been used to that
[46:16] she knew when he said thus saith the
[46:18] Lord
[46:19] it'll be right
[46:23] do you see
[46:26] in his divorce of a man
[46:28] the whole Bible is made by the voice of
[46:30] a man right
[46:33] the living Bible that we would call it
[46:35] like Luther the voice of a man
[46:38] or the message of the Jewish you'll live
[46:40] by faith Wesley
[46:43] Street
[46:46] the voice of a man
[46:48] the Firefall Ministry the laity the
[46:50] people it's in all of the Bride because
[46:52] it's the same voice right right when are
[46:55] we going to believe that amen what about
[46:58] brother Dale how would that
[46:59] contradiction Million Lives too well
[47:01] if I'm a liar don't worry about it I'm a
[47:04] liar
[47:06] you catch me off to work come show me
[47:11] come and tell me
[47:12] that's not right
[47:15] we're down in a certain place one time
[47:16] this big brother was there you know and
[47:18] he said we'll talk a little bit about
[47:19] this brother calling them would start to
[47:21] go sorry and uh he remembers it and
[47:25] the man said now if anything goes wrong
[47:26] said this in your own agrees and raise
[47:28] your hand well he quoted something
[47:31] amen that's raised my hand he said why
[47:33] did Brother that watch your brother
[47:33] didn't say that yes he did he
[47:37] you didn't say that brother I said
[47:39] here's what he said I'm running across
[47:40] like that this other brother was sitting
[47:42] there with him it was his partner you
[47:44] know he said he called his name and he
[47:47] said
[47:48] but then it was right another round
[47:50] didn't say that he said well I'll say
[47:51] it's my own quote I said continue this
[47:54] is your quote but you said brother Brown
[47:55] said that's right
[47:57] why when are we going to be to the place
[47:59] let's run around and said that we would
[48:01] look people in the eye
[48:04] so you're not saying what the prophet
[48:06] said
[48:08] well come and tell me if I'm not saying
[48:10] what the prophets say
[48:14] and don't worry about it if you're right
[48:15] then I don't have any trouble coming up
[48:17] here and telling me Georgia straighten
[48:19] me out because I thank God might get
[48:21] straight down I'm wrong
[48:24] I want to be right
[48:25] right
[48:27] but they gonna gain me a bit
[48:29] to be wrong I'm going to lose everything
[48:33] but if I can be right then it'd be all
[48:34] right
[48:36] words of a man you know today we're
[48:38] based on the words of a man
[48:40] right work to a man Webster real
[48:43] predictionary
[48:47] everything we do is based upon what
[48:49] somebody said
[48:51] done you know Etc made might have
[48:54] finished
[48:56] the words of a man
[48:59] what about Mark 11
[49:02] .
[49:06] we talk about that one
[49:08] verse said if you say unto this mountain
[49:10] be moved right and doubt not in your
[49:12] heart that's it
[49:15] you got two or three quotes laying up
[49:17] here and again to brother Joe if you'd
[49:18] like to see him my brother and said it's
[49:20] not what he said this is what you say
[49:23] Amen
[49:25] and I hope now that you're getting the
[49:27] state getting it in the right place
[49:30] it was Christ in Moses amen that could
[49:34] contact God and actually not straighten
[49:37] him out no
[49:40] not tell him a better way to do it
[49:42] that's just the terminology
[49:45] but could remind him of what he's saying
[49:49] right
[49:50] that's the only way he he didn't
[49:52] straighten God out
[49:55] Hallelujah he just reminded god of what
[49:57] he said all right
[50:00] you ever noticed over in the I think
[50:02] it's about Genesis
[50:04] I can't remember but you'll remember
[50:06] where it said it it's in Genesis where
[50:08] he said it it repented the Lord that he
[50:10] made man right amen now can't you just
[50:13] see that oh Lord I'm sorry who are you
[50:16] talking to that's right you know I
[50:18] didn't think it was what won right who
[50:22] was he repenting to right
[50:26] huh you don't ever read scripture and
[50:28] think like that who's he repenting to
[50:30] right
[50:33] so there's any it repented God
[50:35] what God turned repent me to turn around
[50:38] God turned around from what he was
[50:41] spending their fixing to do
[50:44] he was going to wipe out every one of
[50:46] them
[50:47] he said Noah
[50:49] you make a boat
[50:51] get them in the boat
[50:55] he had plans to screw them all
[50:58] he had plans right there with Israel in
[51:00] Exodus 32 to kill every one of them he
[51:02] done told Moses step aside I'll kill
[51:05] them all and take you and make a nation
[51:06] out of you and he could have done it
[51:08] right right right
[51:12] but that wouldn't the way it's going to
[51:14] be that's right
[51:15] because there was more to the story amen
[51:20] they had to be people to come in the end
[51:22] time could realize what it means to
[51:24] speak the word right
[51:28] not if you say unto this mountain
[51:30] I mean not if I say under the mountain
[51:32] anybody knows God can move around right
[51:34] right but if you say
[51:36] right and doubt not in your heart
[51:40] come put it together with the rest of
[51:41] the scriptures that's it and what does
[51:43] it say
[51:45] I thought the Bible said there said it's
[51:47] not you that's asking it's the father in
[51:50] you that doeth the speaking
[51:53] you want to go straight here
[51:56] it's not you
[51:59] well brother Dale if it's not me then
[52:02] it's not the words of a man that's where
[52:03] you messed it up at because that's what
[52:06] you're looking at
[52:08] God allowed man to speak his word you
[52:13] agree all right well what would be the
[52:16] problem of him today allowing it to be
[52:17] spoken right
[52:22] what's the trouble
[52:24] what's your problem today with
[52:27] with Allowing God to come on the scene
[52:34] and speak through you
[52:38] see it right there
[52:41] I advert I prophecy yeah I believe he
[52:44] speak to brother Brown
[52:45] I believe you can speak through Moses
[52:47] but see that's what the people was back
[52:49] there with Jesus
[52:52] I said We Believe monsters
[52:57] oh yeah we believe everything Moses said
[53:03] Moses spoke of me he said
[53:06] all right
[53:08] and what Jesus said
[53:11] that scripture Jesus said Moses spoke a
[53:14] man that's right
[53:17] me
[53:19] we're Abraham's children he said before
[53:21] Abraham would I am right that's right in
[53:24] other words I spoke to Abraham right
[53:28] when are we going to get down to
[53:29] believing that God can still speak
[53:39] but you know what I told her when I
[53:41] first came into the message because
[53:42] everybody in the message deals with Mark
[53:43] 11 or has been coming down and when they
[53:45] talk about one of these days
[53:49] I said if you don't get the words you
[53:51] can't speak it that's right you know
[53:53] what I mean by that
[53:56] you know that probably Martin Luther
[53:59] don't tell them how many times he read
[54:02] that scripture
[54:04] of the just shall live by faith right
[54:07] he probably preached Sherman's
[54:09] discourses I'll talk classes
[54:17] no telling you
[54:20] but one day it opened up
[54:22] that's right it became alive
[54:27] how many times did we read
[54:29] the Bible
[54:31] I don't see brother George Canada today
[54:33] and I think he's still
[54:35] in my music I believe he said 16 times
[54:37] he read the Bible or something like he
[54:38] told me a number that he read the Bible
[54:43] all right but you see we can read it
[54:47] like I lost my glasses in the airport
[54:49] and I had to borrow him out there every
[54:50] time you know from somebody that's right
[54:52] you get weights you put them on here you
[54:54] ready to get them they got there and he
[54:55] goes yeah I can read it without it
[54:59] let's see if we can read with somebody
[55:01] else's glasses
[55:03] how many times I'm not asking for a
[55:05] raise of hands but how many times did
[55:07] you read the Bible
[55:10] and before you heard this message it was
[55:12] a trinitarian believe in three gods and
[55:14] could read it right out of the book
[55:16] right
[55:19] how many times did you read Acts 2 38
[55:22] verse says repent everyone be baptized
[55:24] in the name of Jesus Christ I remember
[55:26] brother Tatum used to say
[55:28] well the Tatum said he knew there's
[55:29] something wrong there and said when he'd
[55:31] be reading the Bible he'd get over there
[55:32] Acts 2 38 said he'd speed up
[55:35] you know
[55:37] because of you there's something burning
[55:40] causing a problem
[55:42] but how many times did we read the book
[55:49] and what was our thoughts when read it
[55:52] but then when we came into this message
[55:53] and God begins to open the word it
[55:55] became a brand new book right right
[55:58] didn't change the letters on the page
[56:05] well see that's what I was trying to
[56:06] tell the people I said you got to get
[56:07] the word for you can speak it
[56:11] Martin Luther read the judge you live by
[56:13] faith many times but one day he got this
[56:15] picture he got the word
[56:17] and he went out to smoke it you know
[56:19] what it created a Revival around the
[56:21] world
[56:23] is opened unto him
[56:26] and he saw the just shall live by faith
[56:31] what about it
[56:35] at the words of a man
[56:39] our whole life depends upon the fact was
[56:41] you there when Jesus was here on the
[56:43] shores of Galilee no
[56:46] can you prove he existed
[56:50] well they got directly to the other day
[56:52] oh yeah okay yeah they make records
[56:54] anything you want
[57:04] was you there when running around to
[57:05] smoke squirrels into existence
[57:09] you don't know where he did or not
[57:13] you know the only way you'll ever know
[57:14] whether he did or not is not for you to
[57:17] speak them
[57:20] unless we need them
[57:26] but for that same God to speak to you
[57:28] about what you have needed
[57:32] brother Branham said Abraham offered up
[57:34] Isaac
[57:36] right
[57:38] he said now it's nowhere in the Bible
[57:40] for anybody else to do that
[57:51] it was a one-time to Abraham
[57:56] did something personal
[57:59] he picked up that thought from God
[58:02] he was transmitted right down into his
[58:04] life
[58:06] as this message got off the pages into
[58:08] her heart
[58:11] um or is it still just quotes that's why
[58:13] there's so much argument about it
[58:14] arguing over what brother Reynolds said
[58:17] oh I can give you a 100 quotes for that
[58:24] but what about the ones that
[58:26] the other side uses
[58:29] like I heard brother I believe it was
[58:30] brother Maloney told me one time he read
[58:32] this man one man talking about uh saved
[58:35] by faith and he said I read it said boy
[58:36] man I thought it ain't no way in the
[58:38] world nobody else could disprove that
[58:40] and he said then there was another
[58:41] fellow wrote a book you saved my works
[58:43] and he said I got through reading that I
[58:45] didn't know which one was right
[58:47] he's just honest
[58:52] what about it the words of our voice
[58:56] of a man
[58:59] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[59:01] angel
[59:03] when he begins to sound the mystery of
[59:05] God will be revealed
[59:07] do we believe that God has spoken unto
[59:10] us do we believe that spoken word books
[59:13] and things I don't have one to hold up
[59:14] here that's close that's her name I
[59:16] ain't even wrote off of it do we believe
[59:18] that to be the words of a man or do we
[59:21] read it as God's speaking through us you
[59:24] know to us through the man
[59:28] for him to say it is one thing
[59:33] that's why I've always told you
[59:36] that the way I check a Doctrine is by my
[59:40] new birth
[59:43] because there's no way I'll check about
[59:45] folks brother that was it how many more
[59:47] you want conversation
[59:50] give me any quote
[59:52] like probably by memory almost gave you
[59:54] the book it's him to tell you how much
[59:56] what the prophet seemed like he said
[59:57] something else
[59:59] what about it
[1:00:02] we'll go with the Bible
[1:00:07] we're reading the Bible where it says
[1:00:09] baptize the name of the father and the
[1:00:10] son and all the others then we turn over
[1:00:12] a few pages and we read and said and we
[1:00:14] baptize the name Jesus Christ
[1:00:19] what about you
[1:00:23] if this message just become an argument
[1:00:28] something that we cannot argue people
[1:00:30] and we love to talk to other people you
[1:00:33] know because we cannot argue them but
[1:00:35] you don't have the the information we
[1:00:37] have
[1:00:39] courage to become a crashed
[1:00:45] but around October Charlie Cox said
[1:00:47] brother Charlie said the same voice that
[1:00:49] spoke one day and told you to turn
[1:00:51] around in other words your salvation
[1:00:54] he said that same voice will speak one
[1:00:56] day and call you up
[1:01:01] and we heard the voice of God
[1:01:04] or have we heard just the voice of a man
[1:01:10] is this message just arguments over what
[1:01:12] a man had to say
[1:01:18] where is it the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ
[1:01:27] you're his voice
[1:01:32] we're running on perfect Faith said
[1:01:36] he was pleased to use Jesus's voice
[1:01:39] because he lived within him
[1:01:43] and he said if he lived in you
[1:01:47] he's pleased
[1:01:50] to use your voice
[1:01:54] he said when a Believer takes up on his
[1:01:57] heart the word of God
[1:02:00] believe that word
[1:02:02] and speaks it he said it's deity
[1:02:05] speaking
[1:02:12] but you see then everybody will get to
[1:02:13] the bases like one brother has it he
[1:02:15] said everything I say is the Lord I said
[1:02:19] there's something wrong with you God
[1:02:23] improved it
[1:02:29] it'd be nice to come along and be able
[1:02:31] to do like that wouldn't it
[1:02:34] I'm listening to a date yesterday to
[1:02:37] learn the woods hunting and listen to it
[1:02:38] and they run around and said
[1:02:41] you know how a baby gets what it wants
[1:02:44] he said it cries
[1:02:48] he said it cries
[1:02:50] it ain't got a better way in the world
[1:02:52] to figure out how to get it
[1:02:53] work and do it did he just cries
[1:02:59] he said you want something from God
[1:03:02] he said just keep crying
[1:03:06] now this is the words he said he said he
[1:03:09] loves to hear his children cry
[1:03:19] well not brother I got all these other
[1:03:21] quotes over here where I'm supposed to
[1:03:22] speak the word this just get it speak it
[1:03:28] we better do a lot of crying first
[1:03:35] is the only way we can speak his word is
[1:03:37] do a lot of crime till he gives it to us
[1:03:42] there ain't never a prayer that I prayer
[1:03:45] that I ever pray
[1:03:47] and I don't conclude one time
[1:03:50] Lord
[1:03:52] open your word
[1:03:56] Reveal Your Word
[1:04:01] because we got a hand
[1:04:04] who we got it
[1:04:11] excuse me can I say
[1:04:13] we had it
[1:04:19] come on
[1:04:20] we had it didn't we didn't we have the
[1:04:23] Bible
[1:04:28] we've had it all along
[1:04:32] but we didn't have it understood
[1:04:34] correctly
[1:04:35] that's it so now which one do you want
[1:04:39] well we understand one God do we
[1:04:41] understand one God
[1:04:47] we have we understand one God we we've
[1:04:50] got it all down do we understand one God
[1:04:54] laughs
[1:04:56] do we know that they're not the one
[1:04:58] voice of God
[1:05:03] there's thousands of Little Voices yes
[1:05:07] but they better all be saying What God
[1:05:10] Says
[1:05:21] now I got to explain that because I
[1:05:23] don't at least a loop all right
[1:05:25] we'll never around the world never get
[1:05:28] to the place that we're all saying cat
[1:05:30] and everybody around the world says cat
[1:05:31] dog or whatever
[1:05:35] you know better than that
[1:05:39] because I never have believed that we
[1:05:41] all get the same Revelation as the part
[1:05:43] of what we're getting we get to
[1:05:45] Revelation one God but there's many
[1:05:46] other there's many people who can bring
[1:05:48] and help you with that as understanding
[1:05:50] of what God has spoken to them about one
[1:05:52] God if you'll listen to them
[1:05:57] that's right
[1:06:00] people call just a big book
[1:06:03] there's a lot in it
[1:06:06] but it's all the voice of God
[1:06:11] when I'm listening to brother Brown
[1:06:16] that man is speaking to me
[1:06:19] your word
[1:06:23] to whatever my thoughts or opinions are
[1:06:30] no good
[1:06:33] like I told you sitting in the
[1:06:34] Ministries meeting one time with a bunch
[1:06:35] of preachers
[1:06:37] I laid down the criteria you the big old
[1:06:39] words you use there you know something I
[1:06:40] laid down a thing I said run around was
[1:06:43] the prophet
[1:06:45] he's the one that had domestic and
[1:06:47] you're not wrong it don't matter what we
[1:06:48] think
[1:06:49] they all agree amen
[1:06:52] about 20 something low 30 something of
[1:06:53] them
[1:06:56] I read one quote from Brother Branham
[1:06:58] and they spent an hour and a half and we
[1:06:59] never did get onto the topic they spent
[1:07:01] an hour and a half talking about well
[1:07:03] what's wrong this wasn't that way
[1:07:06] I just didn't say no more
[1:07:10] I read one quote word that right around
[1:07:12] said
[1:07:13] the bride goes up in Revelation 4 1 and
[1:07:16] not seen on 1921 and I happened to read
[1:07:18] them the one I believe is off the Feast
[1:07:21] of the trumpet Robertson that's thus
[1:07:23] saith the Lord
[1:07:27] your destiny administers running quotes
[1:07:29] and doing things
[1:07:32] well the Book of Revelation order this
[1:07:36] is
[1:07:44] I'm gonna call his name brother with
[1:07:46] women he said brother Dale I've never
[1:07:48] seen you down and out in your face
[1:07:53] I said brother
[1:07:55] when you go down the factory saying that
[1:07:57] brother random was a prophet
[1:08:00] and what he said was right
[1:08:03] and everybody else spends an hour and a
[1:08:05] half trying to tear it apart
[1:08:10] no wonder I'm down now
[1:08:13] because I thought everybody would agree
[1:08:15] that brother Randall was the prophet and
[1:08:16] he was he was the one that brought the
[1:08:18] magic right
[1:08:20] but see they were trying to straighten
[1:08:21] him out but you know one of those men
[1:08:23] today ever come back and said I was
[1:08:25] wrong brother Dale
[1:08:31] he won't do it
[1:08:35] because they never seen what I'm talking
[1:08:38] about
[1:08:41] if brother Brown says the bride goes up
[1:08:43] in Revelation 4 1 and 19 of 1921 that's
[1:08:46] thus saith the Lord he said then where
[1:08:48] are you and I
[1:08:50] that could argue about that
[1:08:52] what about Revelation 10 7 so what
[1:08:56] Prophet said it's not there well
[1:08:58] Revelation 18 4 come out I hurt my
[1:09:00] people what about it
[1:09:03] he said that's all to Israel
[1:09:06] this message folks will be what will go
[1:09:09] to Israel
[1:09:13] but not brother Brown that's right amen
[1:09:15] right it'll be through two prophets
[1:09:17] right
[1:09:22] do we believe the word or do we believe
[1:09:23] man
[1:09:27] he said what are those blue man it's the
[1:09:30] man speaks according to the word of God
[1:09:32] yes but if he doesn't he speaks
[1:09:34] presumptuous
[1:09:39] that's my brother just now got to
[1:09:41] sending me a letter about something that
[1:09:43] broke my heart to read
[1:09:45] he said please help me
[1:09:49] show us no
[1:09:55] can't send him back anything heavy
[1:09:59] he said he listens to tape so when these
[1:10:00] days I'll cover it
[1:10:04] when I cover it I pray God
[1:10:07] will allow him to hear that message
[1:10:09] right
[1:10:12] because I'm not going to get on the
[1:10:13] internet and argue with nobody you know
[1:10:15] what that does right
[1:10:19] they're just sitting out there waiting
[1:10:20] on you to do something like that and I'm
[1:10:22] not going to do it because this makes
[1:10:23] you not made already
[1:10:31] I have a little topic my last message
[1:10:33] didn't get through with it so you said
[1:10:35] what's the difference in perfect and
[1:10:37] perfection
[1:10:40] my run says you got a question and you
[1:10:41] already said it's God will put somebody
[1:10:44] on the pulpit
[1:10:45] right that's a quote
[1:10:48] but the joke came out in the office and
[1:10:50] handed me a piece of paper he said I
[1:10:52] wrote this down a couple of weeks ago
[1:10:56] you wrote what's the difference in
[1:10:58] perfect imperfection
[1:11:03] if you've got to talk to your mind
[1:11:04] something God put somebody out there
[1:11:07] little answer that no
[1:11:11] one because we believe in a living God
[1:11:13] that's right amen
[1:11:17] and I stood here and told you that my
[1:11:19] son would come back to the Lord
[1:11:22] you think that was me
[1:11:25] or was it the Lord
[1:11:29] you make your choice
[1:11:34] don't you think I'd like to say that
[1:11:36] about everybody
[1:11:39] but when he came back
[1:11:42] and also told my wife that he'd be
[1:11:44] preaching beside him
[1:11:47] was that me or was that the Lord
[1:11:54] how long could we stay here and bring
[1:11:55] out things and see if it was God or was
[1:11:58] it man
[1:11:59] what are you trying to build yourself no
[1:12:01] trying to build God
[1:12:04] because they gonna do you a bit of good
[1:12:05] to build upon me right that's right
[1:12:15] I never actually defied me
[1:12:18] like he did when I started preaching on
[1:12:20] perfection
[1:12:24] but he ain't going to stop me from
[1:12:26] bringing it
[1:12:27] blessed thank you Lord
[1:12:30] he's done everything he could close but
[1:12:33] you can't
[1:12:35] because I believe what God gives me
[1:12:38] is for him
[1:12:40] it's his responsibility to take care of
[1:12:42] it that's right
[1:12:46] what about it
[1:12:49] are we looking at a man or are we
[1:12:50] looking at God
[1:12:53] come on folks if you can't understand it
[1:12:56] God used Balaam
[1:13:00] he used to dumb donkey using a rooster
[1:13:07] it's about like
[1:13:09] that Feller said
[1:13:13] he climbed up in a tree Story Goes
[1:13:16] man walks under him and he said John
[1:13:19] you'd be looking at her words
[1:13:22] start to walk off he said John
[1:13:24] I had a while he said you're called to
[1:13:26] preach
[1:13:28] he said God's been preaching 40 years he
[1:13:30] said can I tell him that was me you know
[1:13:34] I ended up in my tree
[1:13:36] well you know what might have been the
[1:13:38] voice of God that's right all right
[1:13:41] might have just been divorce of God come
[1:13:43] on musician
[1:13:45] think about it
[1:13:49] all of the scriptures tied us together
[1:13:51] to see the voice of God
[1:13:56] when he uses man
[1:13:58] you know what I want to use your sister
[1:14:01] is that in the Bible right
[1:14:06] come on it's not just something that you
[1:14:08] don't mind you know a little monkey
[1:14:11] he uses his people
[1:14:19] he used his people to bring the word
[1:14:24] now listen as we finish
[1:14:26] then is there any problem with seeing
[1:14:29] that he's using people to make the word
[1:14:31] alive
[1:14:33] there's any trouble with that
[1:14:35] accused man to bring it people to bring
[1:14:38] it
[1:14:41] now he's using people to make it alive
[1:14:44] because that's what he's done in every
[1:14:45] age
[1:14:46] he's always had somebody to make the
[1:14:48] word alive
[1:14:50] why can't we believe we're part of it
[1:14:54] the voice of a man
[1:14:59] the son could stand still
[1:15:08] you know the story it went with the rest
[1:15:10] of that
[1:15:14] at the voice of a man the sons Stood
[1:15:16] Still
[1:15:17] the prophet said
[1:15:19] son s-o-n
[1:15:23] he said he stood still
[1:15:27] he said when a little woman needed he
[1:15:28] said he stood still
[1:15:33] the son
[1:15:36] you and I need him he'll stand still if
[1:15:39] we just listen
[1:15:40] that's right
[1:15:42] we might have to wait a little while so
[1:15:44] what
[1:15:45] as I said we may have to cry a little
[1:15:47] bit
[1:15:53] what's wrong with crying
[1:16:00] I'm blessed God I ain't gonna cry I'll
[1:16:02] just speak the word would you mind out
[1:16:03] to cry before you received too
[1:16:08] I was in the crimes when you get what
[1:16:10] you need to speak
[1:16:11] I hope you follow that point
[1:16:14] it's not if I say but if you say
[1:16:21] because it's not you speaking it's the
[1:16:24] father in you he's doing the speaking
[1:16:27] time
[1:16:29] back on these times okay
[1:16:32] 369 the red one all in here
[1:16:38] the Mighty God is Jesus
[1:17:16] Mighty God
[1:17:21] might be moving forward
[1:17:42] oh what about him
[1:17:45] he can't break it wrong
[1:17:52] it works and that's it
[1:17:57] preacher said you'll be
[1:18:02] I will say that
[1:18:04] what's up guys that's mine
[1:18:21] and what he's saying
[1:18:25] it now with your own bro
[1:18:28] I can't explain
[1:18:35] this song
[1:18:45] give me my problems
[1:18:50] but the problem was supposed to make us
[1:18:52] greater Christian
[1:18:57] far
[1:19:11] I'm probably right
[1:19:15] my way say Lord when I have the
[1:19:24] uh
[1:19:38] for him
[1:19:47] I thought we were
[1:19:50] joking I thought we were the children of
[1:19:53] God

[1:19:57] 've got children so young
