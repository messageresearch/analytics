[14:38] hey man is that your desire tonight
[14:42] sure appreciate that special i i think
[14:45] the uh
[14:46] that's a song that people that weren't
[14:48] message believers wrote i believe and
[14:50] it makes you wonder if if they knew it
[14:52] seems like that's a song that really
[14:54] only message believers really know what
[14:56] it really means
[14:58] so we just we just thank the lord
[15:01] it's good to be here tonight tonight i'm
[15:03] going to preach on
[15:05] i'm going to take a look for a little
[15:06] topic from from luke chapter 24.
[15:09] current events made clear brother bob
[15:11] you're you're plagiarizing brother brown
[15:15] uh that's i i that would be the one of
[15:17] the best compliments you could give me
[15:18] is that you're just saying what brother
[15:20] branham said
[15:21] so i'm just obviously what sermon i'm
[15:23] going to preach from tonight is modern
[15:24] events made clear by prophecy but you
[15:27] know there's a lot of things going
[15:28] around uh today a lot of things in the
[15:30] news things happening and things
[15:31] happening over the last couple of years
[15:33] and it'd be it'd be nice if we could
[15:35] make sense of all these things wouldn't
[15:36] it
[15:37] the only way we can make sense of it is
[15:38] by looking into god's word
[15:41] so let's read uh well before we read
[15:43] let's go to the author and and ask him
[15:45] to bless the reading lord jesus we're so
[15:47] grateful to be able to gather together
[15:48] lord and look into your word and we just
[15:50] lord we pray lord that tonight will not
[15:52] be a vain gathering lord we know many
[15:54] have traveled for a long way from
[15:56] different parts of the surrounding area
[15:58] and come lord not to to see one another
[16:00] or to see me but
[16:02] lord we want to see you as we were
[16:04] singing just now lord open your eyes of
[16:06] our heart lord god because we want to
[16:07] see you
[16:08] from our heart by faith lord as we look
[16:10] into your word and we just invite you
[16:12] lord to move among us tonight lord jesus
[16:14] and whatever the needs of your people
[16:16] are lord jesus you know lord i don't
[16:18] know but you know as you look into their
[16:20] hearts lord jesus whatever their need is
[16:21] their desire lord and this in the middle
[16:23] of the week here lord jesus that you'll
[16:25] strengthen them lord god and speak to
[16:27] their need lord because we know that the
[16:29] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[16:30] intents of the heart lord and we ask
[16:32] lord that tonight you'll just let it
[16:34] strike exactly where it needs to lord
[16:36] we ask that blessing upon your word now
[16:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[16:42] so luke chapter 24 reads and if you
[16:44] remember at the beginning of luke
[16:45] chapter 24 that
[16:47] jesus had risen from the grave and
[16:49] everybody was everybody had been going
[16:50] in their little groups mary and joanna
[16:53] and the other mary the mother of james
[16:54] went and and they saw the two angels
[16:57] there and with the shining light and
[16:58] they went back and told everybody and
[17:00] nobody
[17:02] everybody thought it was just idle final
[17:03] fables because you know it was it was a
[17:05] group of ladies and they went and told
[17:07] all the men and none of the men believed
[17:09] because you know sometimes that's how it
[17:11] is sometimes and and
[17:13] and
[17:14] and and uh different and then peter ran
[17:17] and he he looked into the he looked into
[17:19] the tomb and and uh he
[17:22] come on now
[17:25] peter looked peter looked into the tomb
[17:27] and he he uh he saw the grave clothes
[17:30] laying over there but he he he ran back
[17:32] to tell his story and he said i didn't
[17:34] see any i saw the grave clothes but
[17:35] there wasn't a body laying there but i
[17:37] didn't see the body so that kind of sets
[17:39] the
[17:40] the the background as we read this
[17:43] that
[17:44] everybody's looking for truth
[17:45] everybody's looking for evidence
[17:47] and and and they were wasn't it it
[17:49] wasn't clear uh something they could
[17:51] really hang on to yet
[17:53] and behold two of them went that same
[17:55] day to a village called emmaus which was
[17:57] from jerusalem about three school
[17:58] furlongs and they talked together of all
[18:00] these things which had happened
[18:02] and it came to pass that while they
[18:04] communed together and reasoned
[18:06] jesus himself drew dear and went with
[18:09] them but their eyes were holding that
[18:11] they should not know him
[18:13] and he said unto them what manner of
[18:14] communications are these that you have
[18:16] one to another as you walk and are sad
[18:18] and the one of them whose name was
[18:20] cleopas answering said unto him are thou
[18:22] only a stranger in jerusalem and has not
[18:24] known the things which are come to pass
[18:26] there in these days
[18:28] and he said unto them what things
[18:31] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[18:33] of nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[18:36] indeed and word before god and all the
[18:38] people
[18:39] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[18:41] delivered him to be condemned to death
[18:43] and have crucified him
[18:45] but we trusted that it had been he which
[18:48] should have redeemed israel
[18:49] and beside all this today is the third
[18:52] day since these things were done
[18:55] we trusted him and today's the third day
[18:57] and we haven't seen any evidence we
[18:59] we've heard a lot of stories and
[19:01] a lot of things we'll we'll we'll put up
[19:03] in that category of idle talk
[19:05] peter coming back and saying well i saw
[19:07] the garments laid over there but i
[19:08] didn't see a body
[19:11] yeah and certain women also of our
[19:13] company made us astonished which were
[19:15] early at the sepulcher and when they
[19:17] found nada's body they came saying that
[19:19] they had also seen a vision of angels
[19:21] which said that he was alive and certain
[19:24] of them which were with us went to the
[19:26] sepulcher and found it even so as the
[19:27] women had said but him they saw not
[19:30] we didn't see him they didn't see him
[19:33] then he said unto them
[19:35] o fools
[19:36] and slow of heart
[19:38] to believe all that the prophets have
[19:40] spoken
[19:41] what's he was he admonishing him for
[19:44] not not for
[19:45] not for not listening to those people
[19:47] but for not believing what the prophets
[19:49] had spoken
[19:51] all not christ to have suffered these
[19:53] things
[19:54] and to enter into his glory
[19:57] and beginning at moses and all the
[19:59] prophets
[20:00] he expounded unto them and all the
[20:02] scriptures the things concerning himself
[20:05] you may be seated
[20:06] the lord add his blessing to the reading
[20:08] of the word
[20:11] now brother branham said
[20:13] when he preached this sermon he said if
[20:15] the people in the days of the lord jesus
[20:17] would have only sought god
[20:19] and knowed what was just about to take
[20:20] place they would not have condemned
[20:22] jesus to death but the reason it was
[20:24] because the scriptures had to be
[20:25] fulfilled because the jews had to be
[20:27] blinded
[20:28] we all are aware of that
[20:31] now he's talking about the jews had to
[20:32] be blinded for the word of god to be
[20:35] manifested
[20:36] now these two cleopas and his friend
[20:38] were walking along and they were blind
[20:39] that it was held from them and brother
[20:41] branham will explain a little bit later
[20:43] in this sermon why they did not
[20:45] understand who that was talking to them
[20:47] and why did they not they did not
[20:48] understand
[20:50] what had taken place
[20:52] and brother adam said do you realize
[20:54] that that's promised again in this very
[20:56] age that we're living
[20:58] the very age that we're living those
[20:59] things those same things are promised
[21:01] again the laodicean church age this
[21:03] seventh church age that we're in now
[21:05] is naked and miserable and blind and
[21:08] don't know it this very the same church
[21:09] age is blind and doesn't realize the day
[21:13] and the hour that we're living in so now
[21:15] now think think of that what we're
[21:16] talking about tonight
[21:18] that the current events modern events
[21:20] the things that are happening today
[21:22] right now
[21:23] are made clear by prophecy
[21:25] now when brother man preached that
[21:27] sermon you would think that maybe he
[21:28] would talk about politics or maybe he
[21:30] would talk about things going on in
[21:31] current events that you could read in
[21:32] the newspaper but he never talked about
[21:34] those kind of things
[21:35] he talked about what did he talk about
[21:37] he talked about the word of god he went
[21:39] to back back to look at the word of god
[21:40] and so you know there's a lot of strange
[21:42] things that are happening in the world
[21:44] today they're the with the the war and
[21:46] uh somebody asked me i think it was one
[21:48] of my kids dad are you going to preach
[21:49] on ukraine tonight are you going to
[21:51] preach on joseph biden that's what they
[21:53] say
[21:54] are you going to preach on biden and
[21:56] there's a lot of things that there's a
[21:58] lot of things to talk about in current
[22:00] events but you know really if you want
[22:01] to see what's really going on today
[22:04] it's it's actually something that's
[22:06] something that's secret so something
[22:08] that's a mysterious happening something
[22:10] that's taken place in the supernatural
[22:12] realm something has taken place in this
[22:14] building and all around the world all in
[22:16] different churches all around the world
[22:17] something's taken place and what is
[22:19] happening is the word of god
[22:21] for this age is being fulfilled
[22:24] now now the laodicean church age was
[22:26] blind and they're they're they don't
[22:27] recognize it just the same as they
[22:29] didn't recognize it in that first church
[22:31] age
[22:32] just the same as cleopas and his friend
[22:34] failed to recognize it
[22:36] brother brown said the same as he
[22:37] blinded them back there for the purpose
[22:39] of getting his message through to the
[22:41] elected people he's promised to do the
[22:43] same thing today and when was it
[22:45] promised in a day as it was in the days
[22:48] of lot as it was in the days of noah
[22:50] when the world would be would be in this
[22:53] sin sin-sick condition and this horrible
[22:55] condition perverse
[22:57] men and women not knowing what gender
[22:59] they are what they are confused a a
[23:01] state of confusion that's past
[23:03] understanding so confusing that when you
[23:06] talk to people in the world they're in a
[23:07] state of their mind is in a condition
[23:09] where it's almost it makes you your jaw
[23:12] drops sometimes how you wonder you know
[23:14] in one place brother adam said that the
[23:16] only people that would be really have a
[23:18] sane mind would be a holy ghost field
[23:20] christian and you can just go out to
[23:22] to talk to people at work and people
[23:24] people going into a panic constantly
[23:26] constantly in turmoil and to see that
[23:29] god's word is being fulfilled and now
[23:31] look around and see that the condition
[23:33] that the earth is in and you can
[23:35] recognize
[23:36] you can begin to understand by looking
[23:38] at god's word that god
[23:40] some something is happening
[23:42] and understand with clarity get clarity
[23:44] about what's taking place modern events
[23:47] made clear
[23:48] by prophecy and brotherhood said this is
[23:51] a horrible time
[23:52] but it's the most glorious time in the
[23:54] world to preach the gospel
[23:56] think about that now this is a horrible
[23:58] time a horrible time when the whole
[23:59] world is in sin sickness and darkness
[24:02] and it's even the people that proclaim
[24:04] to be christianity now they're just
[24:06] they're just drinking starbucks in the
[24:07] church and they made they made
[24:09] christianity even like a laughingstock
[24:11] where all the all it is is showmanship
[24:13] and stuff and and so forth but yeah this
[24:15] is the the greatest time to preach the
[24:17] gospel if you really know the truth of
[24:19] the gospel because the word and its
[24:21] truth has been poured out and now more
[24:24] than any other age any other age now
[24:26] we've got something to preach
[24:28] we've really got something to preach
[24:30] what are we preaching about when now
[24:32] we're preaching the fullness as the
[24:34] whole bible has been opened up to reveal
[24:37] christ in his fullness back in the
[24:39] church again
[24:40] and it brother adam said if i could have
[24:42] stood on the brink of time before it
[24:43] come into existence and the father would
[24:46] have looked at me and said what time
[24:47] down through these ages would you want
[24:49] to preach
[24:50] i don't want it right now
[24:52] that's right just before his coming
[24:55] why why right now
[24:57] because you know i think in the days of
[24:59] luther you'd you'd be preaching kind of
[25:01] through like a little a little uh slat
[25:03] in the fence like like like it were you
[25:05] know like paul said we looked through a
[25:07] vatice or a lattice you know where you
[25:09] can't quite see the whole picture and
[25:11] the picture began to unfold a little bit
[25:13] more in wesley's day and a little bit
[25:15] more in pentecost as the gifts were
[25:17] restored but now we can see plainly we
[25:20] can see plainly what the things that
[25:22] paul preached and maybe darkness and the
[25:24] things that irenaeus preached but now we
[25:26] can see it plainly and brother ram said
[25:29] about sodom and gomorrah today he said
[25:31] it looks like it's a true time of
[25:33] perversion man are trying to wear
[25:35] women's clothes and women wearing man's
[25:37] clothes and man leaving their hair like
[25:38] women and women having hair like man
[25:41] you think about what he saw back then
[25:43] and now what has turned into now where
[25:45] where they got men going into women's
[25:47] bathrooms and men changing their
[25:49] getting surgeries that look like women
[25:51] and all different kinds of things that's
[25:53] turned into just a mess
[25:54] but it's because god's word is being
[25:57] fulfilled
[25:59] he said what's the matter with this
[26:01] people anyhow
[26:02] he said as the real people this world
[26:05] and if i say this to respect and all my
[26:07] brethren and sisters in christ one of
[26:10] these days somebody's going to say isn't
[26:12] it written that these things should
[26:14] happen first what thing should happen
[26:17] first the things that are happening
[26:19] right now
[26:20] the things what what things that god
[26:23] would send a prophet before his second
[26:25] coming that god would god would god
[26:27] would have seven messengers down through
[26:29] the seven church ages that god would
[26:31] have people in every age that god would
[26:33] have a predestinated people in every age
[26:35] and that means in this age that you
[26:38] would be part of that part of that body
[26:40] that he would call you out that he would
[26:42] he would have you set aside before the
[26:44] foundation of the world and have you
[26:46] reserved to believe this word and this
[26:49] day and somebody is going to eventually
[26:51] look back and say i thought that these
[26:53] things were going to happen and they're
[26:55] happening right now
[26:57] you see why we can have clarity where we
[26:59] can look into what god is doing look at
[27:02] look at this current events of this age
[27:04] and see with clarity why because not
[27:07] because we watch fox news or cnn or
[27:10] because we watch any news channel or
[27:12] reads any newspaper but because we read
[27:14] the news of god's word
[27:16] aren't you glad that you can look into
[27:18] god's word and read it like a newspaper
[27:21] that you can open up the pages of
[27:22] revelation and know what the seven
[27:24] church ages are and know what the seven
[27:26] seals are and know what the seven
[27:28] thunders are you can read first and
[27:30] second timothy and hebrews and know what
[27:33] he's talking about because it's become
[27:35] like a newspaper to you and you can read
[27:37] malachi 4 and you can say i find myself
[27:40] in that scripture you can read
[27:42] revelation 10 and you can you can read
[27:44] luke 17 and you can say i find myself in
[27:47] the bible because you can read it like a
[27:50] newspaper
[27:52] you remember back
[27:54] when the news would come out and it
[27:55] would say
[27:56] and say maybe well the oval orville and
[27:59] wilbur wright they made a little they
[28:01] they were bicycle people and now they
[28:03] uh
[28:04] they repaired bicycles and now they've
[28:06] they made a little airplane and they
[28:07] took off and they were able to fly put
[28:09] her around in the air for a little bit
[28:10] and then then you'd flip over the
[28:12] newspaper and you to read about how that
[28:14] now they're launching up rockets and
[28:16] they're going into space and uruguay and
[28:18] went around the earth and came back and
[28:20] then a little bit longer neil armstrong
[28:22] went up and landed on the moon and did
[28:25] all the things that he was doing it you
[28:26] know all those things are typing you can
[28:28] look at the news and see that things are
[28:30] advancing but you can look at god's word
[28:32] and see that something is advancing what
[28:35] is advancing the strength of god's word
[28:38] and his people the strength of the power
[28:40] of the holy ghost is advancing and
[28:42] brother mohammed said now we want to be
[28:44] posted to know what's to take place for
[28:46] this age that we live in
[28:48] god has allotted his word to each age so
[28:51] much to each age he said what good would
[28:54] it done wesley to continue on with the
[28:56] lutheran message
[28:58] what good would it done pentecostals to
[29:00] continue on with the mess of this
[29:01] message what good will it do pentecost
[29:04] to continue on when the bride's being
[29:06] called see
[29:07] we're right up into the sea time we're
[29:10] coming up into the sea time into the
[29:12] time where all of those things that's
[29:14] grown and it's grown until all of that
[29:17] strength is bubbling up into the seed
[29:19] everything all the power of it
[29:20] everything that went into making that
[29:22] plant grow up from a seed out of the
[29:24] ground into the shuck
[29:26] every little part of that plant is
[29:28] coming up into the seed we're right up
[29:30] into the seed time what are you saying
[29:32] brother bob i'm saying look into god's
[29:34] word and see where you're at look into
[29:36] what the bible says look into what the
[29:38] message says and see where we're at and
[29:40] when you can see where it will give you
[29:42] faith it'll give you confidence of what
[29:45] you're doing here it'll cause you to
[29:47] it'll build up your faith and what our
[29:49] faith is being built up to a place where
[29:51] we can take a body change where we're
[29:53] going to step we're going to step into a
[29:54] place where you'll see the limbs
[29:56] restored
[29:58] you'll see
[29:59] you'll see your body be able to be
[30:00] repaired
[30:01] you say well brother bro i don't i don't
[30:03] i wonder how that could even be possible
[30:05] we're talking about a body change we're
[30:07] talking about your your atoms of your
[30:09] bodies the molecules of your body being
[30:11] changed how hard will it be to for god
[30:13] to heal your toothache how hard would it
[30:16] be for god to hit your leg tonight if
[30:17] we're coming up to see time see time is
[30:21] the strength and the power of the holy
[30:22] ghost back in the body of the believers
[30:24] back in his church the brotherhood said
[30:27] we're living in the day when the
[30:28] manifestation of the word of god has to
[30:30] come to a different age than the
[30:32] pentecostal age it's got to come to a
[30:34] different age it's got to come to
[30:36] fullness what kind of fullness the
[30:38] fullness where christ is manifested in
[30:40] his fullness back in the church again
[30:45] now brother adam said notice he likened
[30:47] it to a grain of wheat
[30:49] the bride the reason that god had to let
[30:50] it go like that
[30:52] that fine real genuine church that was
[30:55] established on the day of pentecost
[30:57] had growed and grow since the day of
[31:00] pentecost
[31:01] into a great church
[31:03] it had to fall into the earth in that
[31:04] dark age and be buried like all sea does
[31:07] it had to die so we could come forth in
[31:09] the reformation again it come forth in
[31:12] the person of a reformation martin
[31:14] luther and from there just like a stalk
[31:16] of wheat coming up the first thing comes
[31:18] up there's two little blades then it
[31:20] keeps adding more blades up come martin
[31:22] luther and then zwingli and on down
[31:24] calvin and as they moved on
[31:26] finally it goes into a tassel
[31:29] now that was john wesley in the wesley
[31:31] age it had a pollen drop back from there
[31:33] come the pentecostal age so close
[31:36] just like a real grain of wheat if you
[31:38] look at the stalk but if you'll take
[31:39] that wheat and move it back there's not
[31:41] one grain in it at all it's only a shuck
[31:44] in the shape of a grain but it's set
[31:46] there for a purpose to shelter the grain
[31:48] until if the sun hits it like that it'd
[31:51] kill it
[31:52] it's got to stay in there until a
[31:54] certain time
[31:56] it's got to stay in there until a
[31:58] certain time
[31:59] and all the life now you know what time
[32:01] it is how you know what time it is in
[32:03] the natural you look at a calendar and
[32:05] you can find out what time it is you
[32:06] look at a clock on the wall and you can
[32:08] see what time it is how you know what
[32:10] time it is to look into god's word and
[32:12] you can see that it's time
[32:14] and all the life leaves the shuck as it
[32:16] left the stalk left the pollen leaves
[32:18] the shuck and goes into the wheat and
[32:20] forms again just like it was down in the
[32:23] ground and he said the life goes through
[32:25] that and goes right on to make the wheat
[32:27] and when the week comes that life that's
[32:29] traveled through that wheat the
[32:31] resurrection brings the whole thing out
[32:33] brings up for the rapture
[32:36] now see
[32:37] he talked about how in the in the life
[32:39] of jesus christ his message started off
[32:41] with divine miracles it started off with
[32:43] him feeding that feeding all the ones
[32:45] with with the loaves of fishes and the
[32:47] and the bread it started off with him he
[32:49] said look at himself when he come the
[32:51] wonderful little prophet the brabha the
[32:53] prophet of galilee why his ministry was
[32:56] wonderful he was welcome in church and
[32:58] his life his ministry went through
[32:59] different phases and you can see brother
[33:01] branham's ministry went through
[33:02] different phases it went through three
[33:04] stages it went through three fools and
[33:06] pulled and just like brother branham
[33:08] brother just like just like jesus where
[33:10] brother brown said one day he sat down
[33:12] and he said i and my father are one he
[33:15] said oh my that was out away with such a
[33:18] fella except you eat the flesh of the
[33:20] son of man and drink his blood you have
[33:22] no life and you why he's a vampire get
[33:24] away from such a person see see there
[33:26] was something had to follow that sign
[33:29] something fallen the shuck held it but
[33:31] now the pulls away it has to you can see
[33:34] in jesus's life his ministry that was
[33:37] three stages and in brother branham's
[33:39] ministry there was three stages and what
[33:41] about the church you've got to have
[33:42] three stages of your life three stages
[33:45] where you move from from grace to grace
[33:47] until finally you come into a place
[33:49] where you too can say i and my father
[33:51] are one how are you going to say that
[33:53] not because you agree with the filth of
[33:55] the world not because you agree with all
[33:57] the different churches and all the other
[33:59] false doctrines but because you have
[34:01] eaten the word precept upon precept
[34:03] lying upon line until you become in
[34:05] union with the word and to the word and
[34:07] you become one and it's christ
[34:09] manifested in you just like it was with
[34:12] jesus
[34:12] just as jesus walked in flesh on the
[34:14] earth the bride is going to walk in
[34:16] oneness in the flesh because she will be
[34:18] the word she will be that germ wheat she
[34:22] will be that coral and wheat come forth
[34:23] to manifest brother brown said we're at
[34:26] the end of denominations the wheats
[34:28] taken shape but what's the matter with
[34:30] the wheat now
[34:32] it must lay in the presence of the sun
[34:34] to ripen before the combine picks it up
[34:37] why is it gonna lay in the presence of
[34:39] the sun to ripen
[34:41] you get tall and you caught tall and
[34:43] tall and you you begin to understand the
[34:44] word and the word begins to open up to
[34:47] you but now now it's got to live now
[34:49] it's got to live and you it lays there
[34:51] and it ripens and ripens until it
[34:53] actually becomes
[34:54] what's happening is every strength every
[34:56] molecule of power in that plant is being
[34:59] funneled up into that little wheat plant
[35:01] and the whole into that corn of wheat
[35:03] and the wheat plant begins to bow over
[35:05] in humility because something is being
[35:07] trans something's happening something
[35:10] supernatural as the wheat plant begins
[35:12] to bow because life is in that wheat and
[35:14] then that corn of wheat white life is in
[35:17] that seed and you can look at the whole
[35:19] rest of that wheat plant and a lot it's
[35:21] all changed because the life has gone
[35:24] into the corn of wheat and now the life
[35:26] is back just like it was when that wheat
[35:29] plant was first planted in the ground
[35:31] when that seed was first planted in the
[35:33] ground
[35:35] my brother said now the events that we
[35:37] see taking place
[35:39] the events that we see taking place
[35:41] it's absolutely showed in the bible of
[35:44] every age
[35:45] we think we're all out of cater but
[35:46] we're not everything's moving just
[35:48] exactly with god's word
[35:50] everything that is everything that is
[35:52] happening
[35:54] everything that is happening is made
[35:55] clear by scripture
[35:57] you know you can read the bible and
[35:58] understand everything that is happening
[36:00] you can understand the king of the north
[36:02] doing things you can understand you can
[36:04] understand what
[36:06] why the world is the way it is you can
[36:08] look into revelation 13 and see the
[36:10] history of the united states
[36:12] you can look you can look through the
[36:14] bible and see exactly what's taking
[36:16] place now brother brown said the bible
[36:18] the bible is a different book from any
[36:20] other sacred book
[36:22] there's no book like the bible because
[36:24] the bible is god in word form
[36:27] now you think about that
[36:29] the bible
[36:31] is god
[36:32] in word form
[36:35] the bible
[36:36] that we read here
[36:38] is god in word form
[36:42] what what does that mean now what does
[36:43] that mean for me
[36:46] you know if you if i wrote an
[36:47] autobiography of myself my my
[36:49] autobiography might have things about my
[36:51] commute to work and how long i sat in
[36:54] traffic and
[36:55] different life events that would make
[36:56] people laugh and be funny and things
[36:59] like that but
[37:00] this bible this bible
[37:02] is not just an autobiography of god
[37:05] it's god in letter form
[37:08] now if you could take every if you could
[37:10] take everything about me for example and
[37:12] all my characteristics and things and
[37:14] put put in a book it would be it
[37:15] wouldn't just be an autobiography it
[37:18] would be me in letter form you could
[37:19] read that and get an understanding of
[37:21] all of my characteristics and everything
[37:23] about me and and and and and and
[37:26] you see what god did when he put himself
[37:29] in letter form as is everything that he
[37:32] is it's the three stages of redemption
[37:34] it's the seven seals it's everything uh
[37:37] the story the stories and and things
[37:39] that were are
[37:40] unfolded in people's lives of abraham
[37:43] and ruth they're more than just stories
[37:45] but they're actually the attributes of
[37:47] god his redemptive power and him
[37:49] manifesting himself in healing and and
[37:52] things and so he took himself and he
[37:54] actually put put himself in le that's
[37:56] why jesus said in john chapter 6 it is
[37:59] the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[38:01] prophet of nothing the words that i
[38:03] speak unto you are not just words
[38:07] they're not just words but they are
[38:09] spirit and they are life
[38:11] they're not just they're not just things
[38:13] that like an autobiography of me or a
[38:15] biography or think nice little stories
[38:18] about me but they're actually myself
[38:20] that's my the things of myself spoken
[38:23] out to you now what that means to you
[38:25] and i is if we read the bible and the
[38:28] spirit quickens what we have received
[38:31] then it will actually make it will
[38:33] transform it into god within us brother
[38:36] said a word is a thought expressed god's
[38:39] thinking expressed it his words through
[38:41] the prophets and they wrote the bible
[38:44] which is in word form and jesus called
[38:46] it a seed and any seed will bring forth
[38:48] of its kind if it's in the right
[38:50] condition the right atmosphere it's got
[38:53] to come according to the word if it
[38:55] comes from god because it's to vindicate
[38:58] or to prove god's presence and he
[39:00] foreknew all these things by his
[39:02] foreknowledge he ordained for ordained
[39:04] it's called in the bible predestinated
[39:06] every age to its place and every man to
[39:08] its place and every messenger to its
[39:10] place he is god the devil ain't pulling
[39:13] nothing over on him and he's god and he
[39:15] has ordained everything to take place
[39:18] and falls just exactly in line with his
[39:21] word
[39:22] so if we can see by his word
[39:24] by his word what age and what time we're
[39:27] living
[39:28] you'll see it right here in the bible
[39:30] these are brother brown's words you'll
[39:32] see it right here in the bible of this
[39:34] age what's supposed to take place
[39:36] at this time
[39:38] why why is that because in this bible in
[39:42] this bible is what god will do in this
[39:44] age
[39:45] in this bible are the names of those the
[39:48] attributes of those written to that will
[39:50] be redeemed in this age
[39:52] do you realize what that brother brown
[39:54] said that when when uh i think it was
[39:56] elijah when he got in a mopey condition
[39:58] and began to wonder if anybody else
[40:00] believed but him god opened up the seven
[40:03] seals to him and he began to recognize
[40:05] that there's seven thousand uh that
[40:06] believed like him that also why because
[40:09] he showed elijah the names
[40:12] i know that's maybe a kind of a mystical
[40:14] concept but when you read the bible and
[40:16] you begin to recognize your place in it
[40:18] it begins to open up because it's more
[40:20] than just an autobiography it's a
[40:23] supernatural spiritual book it's
[40:25] actually god in letter form that he put
[40:27] all of his characteristics and all of
[40:29] his attributes in a form that you can
[40:32] read and meditate on and sit in your
[40:34] closet and think about and when you
[40:36] believe it something supernatural takes
[40:38] place that the letters on the page leap
[40:41] off and they become a living reality to
[40:43] you
[40:44] do you realize what you have access to
[40:46] that smoke does not tonight that you
[40:47] have access to you can sit alone in your
[40:50] house and open up the bible on your
[40:52] table and read the words of life and it
[40:54] will come off and change your life and
[40:57] change your heart and change your
[40:59] thinking and change your mood it'll
[41:01] change your home and change your
[41:02] atmosphere it'll make you think
[41:04] different it'll make you not worry about
[41:06] ukraine and worry about covert or worry
[41:08] about the things taking place in the
[41:10] world because there's power in the
[41:12] written word of god there's power in his
[41:14] word it's not just a book
[41:20] said this book is a prophet
[41:22] it's a different from any other but this
[41:24] book is a prophet
[41:25] this book is a prophet
[41:27] the bible is the word of god for telling
[41:30] the future it foretells because it's
[41:33] forewarned
[41:34] he said if god sends anything he says
[41:36] and promised in the bible that he would
[41:38] do nothing upon the earth until first he
[41:40] revealed it to his servants the prophets
[41:43] now so this bible was written by the
[41:45] prophets by god speaking through the
[41:47] prophets bringing that supernatural
[41:50] element of himself into the written form
[41:53] and then this then that makes this book
[41:55] a supernatural book that can prophesy of
[41:58] the future that speaks of things that
[42:00] are to come and that's why when you read
[42:02] this the bible the scripture says that
[42:04] he will when you when the holy ghost
[42:06] comes he will open up these things to
[42:08] you and show you things to come bring
[42:10] things to your remembrance what's he
[42:12] bringing to your remembrance he's
[42:13] bringing to you the supernatural element
[42:15] of the things that you read and he's
[42:17] showing you things to come because he's
[42:19] making the things that you read leap off
[42:21] the page and it becomes a prophet to you
[42:23] where you don't have to stand confused
[42:25] but you can look you can look with
[42:27] confidence knowing what's happening in
[42:29] the earth
[42:30] what is a prophet an inspired teacher a
[42:33] proclaimer of the word will of god
[42:35] somebody that can speak by inspiration
[42:38] and lift from the letter of the page
[42:40] make it make it the living reality
[42:43] speaking a proclaimer of the actual will
[42:45] of god
[42:46] and brother of said and to reveal this
[42:48] word one say well i got this and bless
[42:50] god it's like that that's just the way
[42:51] it was when jesus came the first time
[42:54] everybody has a doctrine everybody has
[42:56] this
[42:57] it'll have to be something sent to us
[42:58] from god
[43:01] see a man can say anything i see why we
[43:04] had to have a prophet in this day
[43:06] because man got so confused
[43:08] a man could say anything but less god
[43:10] interprets that word see now we have our
[43:12] own interpretation
[43:14] we say it means this
[43:17] so what day are we living in
[43:20] brother and said what a time it is that
[43:21] we're living in something like a
[43:23] calendar
[43:24] you look at the calendar to find out
[43:25] what day of the year you're living in
[43:28] and you look at god's bible to see what
[43:30] age we're living in
[43:32] he said we're not living in the
[43:33] methodist stage the baptist stage we're
[43:35] living in the bride age
[43:37] what is the bride age the time not
[43:40] you're past all the little petty things
[43:42] of of of playing around like we've gone
[43:45] beyond the precepts
[43:47] we're coming into he said the calling
[43:48] bringing back to god through a channel
[43:52] that he promised to bring it back in
[43:55] through a channel
[43:56] he promised to do it
[43:59] what god has promised
[44:01] and what god does
[44:04] proves that it's god doing his own
[44:06] interpreting of his word
[44:11] i know it's wednesday night i'm going to
[44:12] slow down a little bit so we don't get
[44:14] tired
[44:16] i know how it is in the middle of the
[44:17] week
[44:19] you're like i i can't take too much
[44:21] doctrine brother
[44:27] brother said the pharisees missed seeing
[44:29] the confirmation of the promises of
[44:30] god's word being fulfilled
[44:32] the pharisees had their idea the
[44:34] sadducees herodians and oh they had
[44:36] their ideas of how the messiah would
[44:38] come but he come contrary to every one
[44:40] of them but exactly with the word
[44:42] jesus said the same thing was here if
[44:44] you would have known me
[44:46] you should have known my day now think
[44:48] about what story we're trying to tell
[44:49] we're telling the story of cleopas and
[44:51] his friend walking along the way and
[44:53] they didn't recognize who that was
[44:54] walking with him and they didn't
[44:56] recognize that the things that they had
[44:57] heard about that jesus was risen from
[44:59] the dead were true
[45:01] they didn't recognize that jesus was
[45:03] walking in flesh among them that he was
[45:05] right there beside him actually you you
[45:08] wonder you and i put that in present
[45:10] tense do you realize that that god is
[45:12] manifested in flesh again back in this
[45:14] day and he's sitting on the pew next to
[45:17] you
[45:17] he's actually in the church with you
[45:20] he's here he's moving down the aisles
[45:22] and and and they didn't recognize it do
[45:26] you recognize it do we recognize it do
[45:29] we and how will you recognize not me
[45:31] even maybe so much because of what you
[45:32] can see with your natural eyes or
[45:34] because of what you can feel with your
[45:36] emotions
[45:37] but because you look into the word
[45:41] because you look into the word
[45:43] he said jesus said the same thing was
[45:45] here if you would have known me you
[45:46] should have known my day
[45:48] you say well moses we have moses
[45:50] said why if you would believe moses
[45:53] you'd believe me
[45:55] because he wrote to me
[45:57] if you believed moses you'd believe me
[46:01] you think what a powerful statement that
[46:03] is now that that what that means is if
[46:05] you take somebody that's a believer you
[46:08] can put them in any church
[46:10] in any age
[46:11] and they're still going to be a believer
[46:13] you could take abraham and put him on
[46:15] the ark he's still going to believe be a
[46:16] believer you could take noah and put him
[46:18] in laodicea he's still going to be a
[46:19] believer that means that means now that
[46:22] means now if we if we carry that through
[46:24] by let's reason that out now that means
[46:27] if you're if you're in a church where
[46:29] you think well
[46:30] if i be over at that other church over
[46:32] there i could be a whole lot better
[46:33] believer no
[46:35] abraham wouldn't have been a better
[46:36] believer on the ark and noah wouldn't
[46:37] have been a better believer down there
[46:39] with elijah or elisha you're going to be
[46:41] a believer wherever you are you're going
[46:42] to be you're going to be a believer
[46:44] because a believer is going to believe
[46:46] a believer is going to believe
[46:48] now now now take that and meditate on it
[46:50] and drink it up and think about it on
[46:51] the way home maybe
[46:54] now in hebrews chapter one we've been
[46:56] reading uh
[46:57] it says god who at sundry times and in
[46:59] diverse manners spake in time past unto
[47:01] the fathers by the prophets and brother
[47:03] abraham said in hebrews 1 1 god in
[47:05] sundry times wrote the bible by his own
[47:07] chosen way he never wrote it by
[47:10] theologians and neither does he
[47:11] interpret by theologians there never was
[47:14] a time that the theologians ever had an
[47:16] interpretation of the word of god the
[47:18] interpretation comes only to a prophet
[47:21] and the only way we're ever going to get
[47:23] out of this mess is for god to send us
[47:25] that prophet which we believe he did
[47:28] just exactly the only way it's going to
[47:30] be done now now listen what he said that
[47:32] prophet is now he begins to compare the
[47:34] prophet that we've heard with john the
[47:36] baptist
[47:37] john the baptist had a message and his
[47:39] message was
[47:40] brotherhood said there was coming a time
[47:42] when god would make a sacrifice out of
[47:44] the lamb of god a man that was john the
[47:46] baptist message that god's going to have
[47:48] a sacrifice i'm not even worthy to loose
[47:50] the buckles on his shoe i'm not worthy
[47:53] i'm not even worthy to be i need he said
[47:54] i need you need to be baptized in me but
[47:57] jesus jesus said we've got we've got to
[47:58] go through with with all the things that
[48:00] the scripture says but go ahead and
[48:02] baptize me and john said he said he
[48:04] would know him when he come
[48:06] that john would recognize him when he
[48:08] come now come on now think spiritually
[48:11] now i know it's a little deep for
[48:12] wednesday night he said he was sure of
[48:14] his message he said he's this is what
[48:16] john said
[48:18] he said he's standing right among you
[48:21] now
[48:22] and you don't know it that's what john's
[48:24] message was his message was to declare
[48:26] that he's here right now he's right
[48:28] among you and you don't know it now
[48:30] think about the message that brother
[48:31] branham came to to preach to us that
[48:33] he's
[48:34] and you will see it in in later on in
[48:36] this message that he's here that that
[48:38] we've come back to the corn of wheat and
[48:40] he's here he's he's in flesh here he's
[48:43] manifesting himself now and
[48:45] do we recognize it or are we like
[48:47] cleopas and his friend walking along the
[48:49] way with god and flesh right next to
[48:51] them but he was veiled from their eyes
[48:53] because they couldn't look back into the
[48:54] scripture and they didn't understand the
[48:56] things that that had been taught by the
[48:58] prophets the prophets were the one that
[49:01] had written the bible the prophets were
[49:03] the one that gave us the word the
[49:04] prophet threw the prophets through the
[49:06] prophet's word and they failed to
[49:08] recognize that god was manifested in
[49:10] their midst because they didn't they
[49:12] didn't know what the prophets had said
[49:16] brother and said the man who's seen the
[49:17] vision or heard his voice
[49:19] never altogether understood it in many
[49:21] cases he didn't know talking about
[49:22] prophets they just they would speak the
[49:24] word because it wasn't their word it was
[49:26] it was god speaking through them he said
[49:28] it's god's thought expressed through
[49:31] man's lips a thought course is a word
[49:34] expressed he'd done it in every age he
[49:37] set forth a man for every age what's he
[49:40] doing in every age it's he's taking this
[49:42] word this word is being planted in each
[49:45] one of our hearts every belief there's
[49:47] there's there's there's a predestinated
[49:49] amount of believers in every age that
[49:51] are going to believe it and the word is
[49:53] sown and that actually makes the word
[49:55] being planted because romans says for if
[49:58] we have been planted together in the
[50:00] likeness of his death we shall be also
[50:02] in the likeness of his resurrection
[50:06] first corinthians says so also is the
[50:08] resurrection of the dead it is sown in
[50:10] corruption it is raised in incorruption
[50:14] it is sown in dishonor this planet is
[50:17] sown it's like the word of god is being
[50:18] planted in you
[50:20] and that's how you're going to be
[50:21] resurrected because the word of god was
[50:24] planted in you
[50:25] and if the word is planted in you you're
[50:27] going to come up from the ground even if
[50:29] you die you're going to come up it's
[50:31] sown in dishonor it's raised in glory
[50:33] it's sown in weakness it is raised in
[50:35] power it has sown a natural body it's
[50:37] raised a natural body
[50:39] there's a natural body and there is a
[50:40] spiritual body
[50:42] that's why brother brahma said if you
[50:43] were a son or a daughter of god you were
[50:45] in god all the time but he knew listen
[50:47] to this
[50:49] he knew what bed and time that you'd be
[50:52] planted
[50:54] he knew the age that you'd be planted in
[50:58] so now you're made a creature a son of
[50:59] god manifested son or daughter of god to
[51:02] meet the challenge of this hour to
[51:03] vindicate the true and living god of
[51:05] this hour what's your predestinated plan
[51:07] and purpose what's your purpose in this
[51:09] hour what's your purpose in this church
[51:10] to meet the challenge of this hour that
[51:13] means when you go into your workplace
[51:15] and you hear all the all the cussing and
[51:17] all the violence and everything you're
[51:19] you're there to meet that challenge to
[51:21] be a light to the people that you work
[51:23] with to be a light to the people in your
[51:24] church he said that's right you was done
[51:27] there before the foundation of the world
[51:28] because god always knew that you were
[51:30] coming
[51:31] well what a blessing and a promise that
[51:33] we had think about that to know that god
[51:36] always had you in his mind there on the
[51:38] cross he had you in his mind
[51:40] now now if you're planting
[51:43] if you're planted what happens when a
[51:44] seed is planted
[51:46] when a seed is planted it starts adding
[51:47] nutrients and it grows and it grows and
[51:50] grows until it comes up
[51:51] brother ryan said when a baby is
[51:53] conceived in the womb of a mother when
[51:54] that one cell goes in there another cell
[51:56] builds on top of that
[51:58] it's not one cell of a human the next of
[52:00] a dog the next of a cat and the next of
[52:02] something else is absolutely straightly
[52:04] human being
[52:05] as human cells building one on top of
[52:07] the other now now if you're feeding on
[52:09] this word of god
[52:11] then what is it building it's building
[52:13] word upon top of word on top of word
[52:15] until you come to a full stature he said
[52:19] when a man is born of the spirit of god
[52:21] he don't inject anything into his life
[52:23] it's unadulterated word of god
[52:25] vindicated for that hour
[52:27] he takes the full word of god he don't
[52:29] put no creeds nothing else into it it's
[52:32] purely unadulterated god's word made
[52:35] manifest
[52:36] among us
[52:38] so look at the bible
[52:40] look in the bible and you can see where
[52:41] what age we're living in then
[52:44] when you see these great things being
[52:47] made manifest
[52:49] what great things are you talking about
[52:50] brother bob i'm talking about the bride
[52:53] coming into fullness i'm talking about
[52:55] these great things that you as you eat
[52:57] the word it builds word upon word
[52:59] because because we're not reading an
[53:01] autobiography of somebody we're reading
[53:03] the actual we're eating from the body
[53:06] word of god and we're believing on
[53:08] something that's not just like a book a
[53:09] self-help book that you can get in the
[53:11] christian bookstore and these things are
[53:14] being added on to us until it comes
[53:16] we're growing just like a little baby
[53:17] grows in the womb until it comes to a
[53:19] place where we've been built up so look
[53:22] look in the bible and see where we are
[53:24] look in the in the calendar of god's
[53:26] word to see what time and what age we're
[53:28] living in
[53:31] brother am said when a man or a woman
[53:32] has said undecrees and coal formal
[53:34] religion if he's ordained to be a son of
[53:36] god and he sees the word of god preached
[53:38] in his power and god vindicated he's an
[53:41] eagle to begin with he'll run to it as
[53:43] sure as twos two is four he can't help
[53:45] it because his very nature loves the
[53:48] word of god
[53:49] that's what happens when you're born
[53:50] again it'll take you right straight to
[53:52] the word why because that's where you
[53:53] get your nourishment this we're running
[53:56] to our ill shadow this is like a little
[53:58] baby that gets all of his nourishment
[54:00] and all of his strength from his mama
[54:02] turns to the breast when we have
[54:03] something that we when we we know we
[54:05] need something so we turn to god's word
[54:07] and that's where we get all of our
[54:09] strength all of our source of everything
[54:11] the source of our life the source of our
[54:14] of our strength in time of trouble is
[54:16] our el shaddai and you can't help it
[54:18] because your nature loves the word of
[54:20] god
[54:21] he said now we realize that we're living
[54:23] in a tremendous time and a great time
[54:25] but when the truths of this bible
[54:28] believers have seen that vindicated
[54:30] the very vindication of it is the
[54:32] evidence that god is in it
[54:35] when you see god's word being made
[54:36] manifest in your life
[54:38] and in the church and in the bride and
[54:40] the people that you love and in your
[54:42] family it's the vending that's the proof
[54:44] the proof of it
[54:45] it's then that the promised word that
[54:47] god god's promised is made known
[54:50] the seed is bursted forth
[54:53] and they see it and they believe it
[54:55] others just can't see it
[54:58] somehow
[55:00] they'll set and look at it
[55:03] maybe like cleopas and his friend
[55:07] just walking along and said and look at
[55:09] it
[55:12] that's why the bible says in matthew 7
[55:14] jesus said not everyone that saith unto
[55:16] me lord lord shall enter into the
[55:17] kingdom of heaven
[55:20] but he hath do that doeth the will of my
[55:22] father which is in heaven what's his
[55:23] will is his word
[55:25] his will is how are you going to know
[55:27] what you're supposed to do if you do if
[55:29] you look in the word that says you need
[55:30] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[55:31] jesus christ you're going to do his will
[55:33] that's his will if his bo if the bible
[55:35] says you need to be born again then your
[55:38] heart will be set on doing the will and
[55:39] you're going to do everything you can to
[55:40] be born again now if the bible says that
[55:43] not to forsake the assembling together
[55:46] even so much as you see the day
[55:47] approaching then you're gonna do his
[55:49] will because the bible says that's what
[55:50] you need to do and you look in the into
[55:52] the bible to see what you're supposed to
[55:54] be doing and if you're not acting the
[55:56] right way and doing the right way then
[55:57] you your heart will be motivated to
[55:59] match up with that because you want to
[56:01] do the will of god
[56:03] but there's going to be a lot that will
[56:05] just say lord lord
[56:07] and not do his will
[56:09] many will say to me in that day lord
[56:11] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[56:13] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[56:15] then thy name done many wonderful works
[56:17] and then will i profess unto them i
[56:19] never knew you depart from me you that
[56:20] work iniquity
[56:23] and brother brown said there's many
[56:24] people just can't believe it even
[56:26] spirit-filled people
[56:29] i'm going to give you one that'll choke
[56:30] you these are his his words
[56:32] you think about many spirit-filled
[56:34] people
[56:35] won't be able to believe it
[56:38] he said the baptism that holy ghost
[56:40] doesn't mean you're going in not at all
[56:43] not on that don't have nothing to do
[56:44] with your soul that's the baptism see
[56:47] he said here's the inside soul and here
[56:49] what's the inside soul
[56:51] faith or doubt
[56:53] do you believe
[56:54] now not not based on whether you have
[56:56] emotion or whether you went to a camp
[56:58] meeting or whether you went to a a nice
[57:00] youth service and you and you ran up and
[57:02] down the aisle what do you believe
[57:05] do you believe
[57:07] here's the inside soul in here that has
[57:08] to come from god remember in that spirit
[57:10] in the spirit you can be baptized with a
[57:12] genuine spirit of god and still be lost
[57:16] see that means you could be baptized in
[57:17] your spirit and you can sing good songs
[57:19] in church and and you can do all the
[57:21] things that looks like a christian would
[57:23] do and and see it amongst people and and
[57:25] put on a good show but he said it's the
[57:28] soul that lives
[57:29] that was ordained of god
[57:31] it's the soul that lives now now look at
[57:33] all these examples in the old testament
[57:36] of like caiaphas that he said didn't
[57:38] caiaphas prophesy he was a devil then
[57:40] priest and great man was supposed to be
[57:41] great leaders in them days with humility
[57:43] and everything else but failed
[57:46] to see
[57:47] the word of god itself
[57:50] made manifest before them
[57:52] caiaphas failed to see the word of god
[57:55] there on the cross being crucified he
[57:57] failed to recognize that that was the
[57:59] word of god what did he fail to believe
[58:02] that that was god in flesh
[58:07] balaam when balaam went out as a prophet
[58:08] brother and said it went down there a
[58:10] bishop preacher whatever you want to
[58:11] call him he was a great man but when he
[58:13] consoled to god about going down there
[58:14] and cursing israel god told him don't go
[58:16] but he didn't believe he didn't believe
[58:19] and he said now we find out balaam of
[58:21] course he couldn't see
[58:22] he went out and looked upon the people
[58:24] and said now just a minute we're a great
[58:26] big people up here you're just a
[58:27] scattered bunch you see
[58:29] and we all
[58:31] believe
[58:32] the same
[58:33] god
[58:34] what was balaam's doctrine let's let's
[58:36] sit on this for a little bit
[58:38] balaam's doctrine was we're all the same
[58:43] what's so wrong about that
[58:46] you see where the the world council of
[58:48] churches believes that it turns into
[58:50] we're all the same
[58:51] we're all the same in other words it
[58:53] doesn't matter what you believe
[58:55] it doesn't matter if these people are
[58:57] baptized and wrong over here and they
[58:58] these it doesn't matter we're just we're
[59:00] just all you see what a great deception
[59:02] that is
[59:04] so when you begin to say
[59:06] well
[59:07] i don't understand why ministers are so
[59:09] critical of these different doctrines
[59:10] and things or i don't understand why
[59:12] you're saying these people over at this
[59:14] other church aren't preaching according
[59:15] to what brother rahm said
[59:17] are you say you got to be careful that
[59:18] you don't say well we're just all the
[59:20] same now now now let's not go too far
[59:23] and start putting people out and say
[59:24] well i don't believe they're not born
[59:25] born again or nothing well i'm not
[59:27] saying that now what i'm saying though
[59:29] is it matters what you believe
[59:32] it matters what you believe now see
[59:34] balaam was saying let's it don't matter
[59:36] what we believe let's just all mix
[59:38] together
[59:39] you're it's okay if you're if you're
[59:41] young people go marry people that don't
[59:43] that are wearing pants and makeup and
[59:45] don't even believe like us it's all
[59:46] right to do that because i just believe
[59:48] in mixing that was balaam's doctrine was
[59:51] let's mix unbelief with belief let's mix
[59:54] it all together and put it in a pot and
[59:55] stir it up and we'll just say we're all
[59:57] we're all because that's what his
[59:59] doctrine he god doesn't want mixers
[1:00:01] he wants separators what a strange thing
[1:00:04] to think about that god god wants now
[1:00:07] see what we'll think we'll think in our
[1:00:09] mind sometimes that that god wants us to
[1:00:11] just
[1:00:12] we want to be kind and loving to one
[1:00:14] another and and lead people to the
[1:00:16] gospel but he doesn't want us to do like
[1:00:18] eve and just throw down the barrier and
[1:00:19] say well it doesn't matter anymore i'm
[1:00:21] just going to go out and and listen to
[1:00:22] whatever
[1:00:24] he he wants us to to discern the word he
[1:00:27] wants us to be able to look at things
[1:00:29] with a discerning heart and say that's
[1:00:31] true well that's not true and when you
[1:00:34] say it doesn't matter anymore then
[1:00:36] you're doing like balaam see how
[1:00:38] dangerous i really want to stress that
[1:00:40] it's dangerous when you begin to say
[1:00:42] that it doesn't matter
[1:00:46] i could
[1:00:47] maybe nail that down a little bit more
[1:00:48] but i'm i'ma back off a little you see
[1:00:51] balaam
[1:00:52] balaam couldn't see the difference
[1:00:55] he couldn't see the difference you think
[1:00:57] about that statement now
[1:00:59] couldn't see the difference what
[1:01:01] difference between right and wrong
[1:01:04] you see what a great blessing it is to
[1:01:06] be able to see the difference because
[1:01:08] there's many people you know that i've
[1:01:10] talked to many people that that can't
[1:01:11] tell the difference when you listen to a
[1:01:14] wrong doctrine can you tell the
[1:01:15] difference when you listen to what some
[1:01:18] some of the things that are being
[1:01:19] preached out there does it matter does
[1:01:20] it matter to you
[1:01:22] does it can you tell the difference when
[1:01:24] somebody says it's like we're just
[1:01:27] well
[1:01:28] brother around said you can't mix that
[1:01:29] leaven with the unleavened
[1:01:31] oil and water will not mix
[1:01:34] darkness and light will not mix
[1:01:37] light's so much powerful that just puts
[1:01:39] the darkness out and so we cannot mix it
[1:01:41] together neither can you mix sin of the
[1:01:44] world together you can't mix church and
[1:01:46] denomination together
[1:01:48] you can't mix church and creed together
[1:01:51] you can't mix the world and the gospel
[1:01:53] together it won't mix
[1:01:55] come out from among them be separate you
[1:01:58] see there had to come a time when
[1:01:59] abraham separated from lot he walked
[1:02:01] along with him far enough and then he
[1:02:03] kept
[1:02:04] look as you're walking up the statue of
[1:02:06] a perfect man there's going to come a
[1:02:07] time where you have to pull back from
[1:02:09] people and say well
[1:02:11] you you know i that's great that's i
[1:02:13] love you as a brother i love you but you
[1:02:15] know we're we're marching on why because
[1:02:17] you got to stay in line with the word
[1:02:20] you got to stay with what the word says
[1:02:22] it doesn't matter what the what the top
[1:02:24] tier preachers in the message are
[1:02:26] preaching it doesn't matter what the
[1:02:27] great men of the message were preaching
[1:02:29] i'd rather stay with the word and these
[1:02:31] soda crackers and sit by a branch and
[1:02:34] all the different things preach to a
[1:02:35] fence post that then then then then grab
[1:02:39] on to the coat hails of the great men
[1:02:41] and the giants so-called great mens and
[1:02:43] the giants of the message and go let off
[1:02:45] into some something that will keep me
[1:02:47] from being able to take a body change
[1:02:50] because wow because we're coming to a
[1:02:52] place where the the life has got to go
[1:02:55] back into the grain and it's only going
[1:02:58] to go back into the grain by the word
[1:03:00] and the word is going to cause
[1:03:02] difference
[1:03:04] the word is going to cause separation
[1:03:07] you see when you begin to say well we're
[1:03:09] just all going to lump together in a
[1:03:10] great big ball of love
[1:03:13] and it just don't work because the bible
[1:03:15] is not meant to to be that way
[1:03:18] he said i come to i come to bring a
[1:03:20] sword
[1:03:21] it'll cause division in the house it'll
[1:03:23] cause people in your family to be like
[1:03:25] why don't you believe like why don't you
[1:03:26] come to our church where we have
[1:03:28] starbucks and everybody they take the
[1:03:30] pews out and everybody hops up and down
[1:03:31] while they while they have a light show
[1:03:33] in the church and oh you you can't do
[1:03:35] that because you can't just lump
[1:03:38] everything together like that
[1:03:40] because that will make you a balance
[1:03:43] balaam's could not see the difference
[1:03:47] there's a truth and there's a false
[1:03:49] there is a truth no matter how we want
[1:03:52] to just lump everything together and
[1:03:53] just say well we just love everybody we
[1:03:55] do love everybody but you can't love
[1:03:58] false doctrine
[1:04:00] because false doctrine a lie a false
[1:04:02] doctrine a false doctrine comes from the
[1:04:04] devil
[1:04:05] anything false is a lie and it came from
[1:04:08] the devil
[1:04:10] brother i said remember the sin that
[1:04:12] israel did by balaam saying they're all
[1:04:16] the same
[1:04:18] that sin never was forgiven israel
[1:04:23] the sin of saying they're all the same
[1:04:30] he said pharaoh couldn't see it
[1:04:32] pharaoh balaam couldn't see it pharaoh
[1:04:35] couldn't see it though vindicated it
[1:04:36] right before him dathan couldn't see it
[1:04:38] he went out there said you try to think
[1:04:39] you're the only one in the bunch the
[1:04:41] whole congregation is holy god never
[1:04:44] deal like that
[1:04:45] he ought to have known better than that
[1:04:48] he couldn't see it
[1:04:53] he couldn't see it what does see to
[1:04:55] discern
[1:04:56] now i'm not i'm not talking about the
[1:04:58] discernment like brother branham had the
[1:04:59] supernatural desire to be able to tell
[1:05:01] whether somebody was looking at
[1:05:02] pornography at home or
[1:05:04] sleeping around with somebody or
[1:05:05] something i'm talking about being able
[1:05:06] to tell whether something is true or
[1:05:10] false
[1:05:11] like where brother where jesus said in
[1:05:13] matthew 24 there will arise false
[1:05:15] christs and false prophets and shall
[1:05:17] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:05:18] that if it were possible they shall
[1:05:20] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:05:23] possible but the elect is going to be
[1:05:25] able to tell
[1:05:26] to discern
[1:05:28] how will you discern by what comes out
[1:05:30] of somebody's mouth
[1:05:32] and if what comes out of somebody's
[1:05:34] mouth is it doesn't matter what we
[1:05:36] believe it doesn't matter we're all the
[1:05:38] same
[1:05:40] can you not discern
[1:05:42] can you not tell
[1:05:44] brother i haven't said so close look the
[1:05:46] bible said in the last days the two
[1:05:48] spirits would be so close it would
[1:05:51] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:05:53] possible
[1:05:54] that shuck looks just exactly like the
[1:05:56] wheat but it ain't the wheat
[1:05:58] it looks like the wheat but it ain't the
[1:06:00] wheat
[1:06:01] it isn't the wheat but it looks just
[1:06:04] exactly like it
[1:06:07] it's going to church and sitting there
[1:06:08] saying i believe a prophet it's amen in
[1:06:10] the church now i'm not preaching
[1:06:12] something where we're going around pink
[1:06:13] finger pointing at one another i i'm
[1:06:16] what i'm preaching is that
[1:06:18] that we should come to a place where we
[1:06:19] know why because the strength of the
[1:06:21] power of the holy ghost has come up in
[1:06:23] the church where we know what we believe
[1:06:25] we know what we stand for and we do
[1:06:27] stand for something if you don't know
[1:06:29] what truth is how do you know what to
[1:06:31] stand for you've got to stand for the
[1:06:33] truth
[1:06:34] he said remember the wheat just keeps
[1:06:36] going on
[1:06:38] past all the carriers passed all the
[1:06:40] shock it just keeps on going going on
[1:06:42] and the resurrection
[1:06:44] all that strength
[1:06:47] of the wheat
[1:06:48] will come right up into the wheat
[1:06:51] all that strength
[1:06:53] of the wheat
[1:06:54] will come right up
[1:06:56] as it goes to make the head
[1:06:58] to come out in the great resurrection
[1:07:01] all the strength of that wheat plant
[1:07:06] that makes you
[1:07:07] that makes you as a believer it makes
[1:07:08] you unique
[1:07:10] it makes you supernaturally unique
[1:07:12] that's why he preached that sermon one
[1:07:13] in a million to think that
[1:07:15] he said what it what if i'd it'd be that
[1:07:16] way tonight there's 500 million supposed
[1:07:18] to be i think christians in the world
[1:07:20] about that figure just a round figure if
[1:07:22] the rapture would come tonight then in
[1:07:23] the living there'd only be 500 people
[1:07:25] one in a million
[1:07:27] one in a million that would go because
[1:07:31] when you believe the word it makes you
[1:07:32] unique
[1:07:35] so why didn't coral see that
[1:07:38] why didn't dathan see that
[1:07:40] why didn't they have to see that
[1:07:43] let's let's let's meditate on ahab i
[1:07:44] know the the time's getting away well
[1:07:47] i'll be closing in just a minute
[1:07:49] hang on with me just a little bit longer
[1:07:52] why didn't ahab see that
[1:07:54] and ahab king of israel said unto
[1:07:56] jehoshaphat king of judah will thou go
[1:07:58] with me to ramoth gilead in second
[1:07:59] chronicles chapter 18
[1:08:01] and he answered it i am as thou art
[1:08:04] jehoshaphat answered i am as thou art
[1:08:06] and my people
[1:08:08] as thy people and brother brown said oh
[1:08:11] he'd do it he first of all he starts off
[1:08:13] like balaam saying we're all the same
[1:08:17] but they weren't all the same now you
[1:08:19] can't help being different
[1:08:21] it's not you that says i'm going to be
[1:08:23] different but you know you're not the
[1:08:25] same you're not the same as the world
[1:08:27] you've been called out and you've been
[1:08:28] made different
[1:08:29] he said jehoshaphat being a great
[1:08:31] religious man he said well we should go
[1:08:33] up sure to our church we're all the same
[1:08:36] people but they wasn't the same people
[1:08:40] they wasn't the same people
[1:08:42] you don't look like the world you don't
[1:08:43] act like the world you don't dress like
[1:08:45] the world and sometimes you don't dress
[1:08:47] like other churches you don't act you
[1:08:49] don't maybe you don't believe like other
[1:08:50] other people do
[1:08:52] he said but in the bible it says but
[1:08:54] jehoshaphat said is there not a prophet
[1:08:55] of the lord besides that we might
[1:08:57] inquire of him and the king of israel
[1:08:59] said unto unto jehoshaphat there is yet
[1:09:02] one man by whom we may inquire of the
[1:09:04] lord
[1:09:05] but i hate him
[1:09:07] for he never prophesied good unto me you
[1:09:09] see how spirits work in the church
[1:09:11] sometimes ministers will be preaching
[1:09:13] i remember i remember growing up in
[1:09:15] church and i remember
[1:09:16] some of the older ministers preaching
[1:09:18] about how when they came into the gospel
[1:09:20] like they'd want to like run somebody
[1:09:21] off the side of the road or something
[1:09:23] because it's like you know there's
[1:09:24] something warring in you
[1:09:26] until until something strikes to change
[1:09:29] your nature
[1:09:30] and see that's why sometimes people will
[1:09:32] hate the ministers and hate the things
[1:09:34] that are preached they'll hate you and
[1:09:36] you're in your for for proclaim for
[1:09:38] standing for something
[1:09:39] because if if you the truth when the
[1:09:42] truth comes against you it it something
[1:09:45] in unbeliever will rise up and lash out
[1:09:48] ahab said i hate him
[1:09:50] he said yes brother brother said yes
[1:09:52] there is there's one micah the son of
[1:09:53] emolum but i hate him
[1:09:55] always that way
[1:09:57] i hate him because he's always just
[1:09:59] bawling out our people out and cursing
[1:10:01] me and telling me all the evil about me
[1:10:04] i hate the man
[1:10:06] he said i i don't let the king say so
[1:10:08] joshua says go get him
[1:10:10] i hate him
[1:10:11] now you see in second timothy it says
[1:10:14] that that's how people would be in this
[1:10:16] day without natural affection truce
[1:10:18] breakers false accusers incontinence
[1:10:20] fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:10:23] in amos chapter 5 they hate him that
[1:10:25] rebuke it rebuketh in the gate and they
[1:10:27] abhor him that speaketh uprightly in
[1:10:30] galatians 4 16 paul said am i therefore
[1:10:32] become your enemy because i tell you the
[1:10:34] truth
[1:10:36] because i say the truth
[1:10:41] see how we won't we want the truth the
[1:10:43] truth is what will set things in order
[1:10:46] you know honestly i even i even i i said
[1:10:49] in my mind when i got married that i was
[1:10:51] gonna if my wife gave me okra and i
[1:10:53] didn't like okra i was gonna tell her
[1:10:54] the truth i don't like
[1:10:56] you know even to this day i don't i
[1:10:57] don't like sweet potatoes and i i i told
[1:11:00] her i don't like sweet potatoes because
[1:11:01] i i don't want sweet potatoes so the
[1:11:04] truth you know a lot of people will get
[1:11:05] all drawn up they won't they won't tell
[1:11:07] their wife the truth because they're
[1:11:08] scared of her well you can say it in
[1:11:10] love i'm not i'm not talking about being
[1:11:12] being silly or something but you can you
[1:11:14] can you can have a frank conversation at
[1:11:16] your table with your family and just
[1:11:18] just speak truth to one another
[1:11:20] you can you can because the truth the
[1:11:22] truth is what will set you free now i'm
[1:11:25] not talking about be to be without
[1:11:26] discretion don't be saying saying things
[1:11:29] without wisdom to to one another but but
[1:11:31] you can say it in love and truth in a
[1:11:34] way that will that will that will change
[1:11:36] things
[1:11:37] you know if you
[1:11:38] if you know if your wife's walking out
[1:11:40] of the house with a dress that's too
[1:11:42] short or too tight you can pull over to
[1:11:44] the side and speak truth to her and say
[1:11:46] you shouldn't wear that and then she'll
[1:11:48] respect you more for it why because we
[1:11:50] want truth the truth is what will set
[1:11:53] you free
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:58] that's why brother roman said there
[1:11:59] happened to be a god to be that god had
[1:12:02] a man that they couldn't put their hands
[1:12:03] on him god had his hands on him he was
[1:12:05] just the reflector of god's truth
[1:12:10] he was the reflector of god's truth
[1:12:13] truth
[1:12:14] and the second chronicles that goes on
[1:12:16] to say then zedekiah the son of chennai
[1:12:18] came near and spoke smoked micah up on
[1:12:20] the cheek and said which way went the
[1:12:21] spirit of the lord for me to speak unto
[1:12:23] thee
[1:12:24] and micah said behold thou shalt see
[1:12:26] you're going to see on the day when thou
[1:12:28] shalt go in an inner chamber to hide
[1:12:30] thyself
[1:12:31] you'll see then
[1:12:33] brother roman said the big bishop walked
[1:12:35] up and slapped him in the mouth said
[1:12:36] which way did the spirit of god go
[1:12:39] he said because i know i had the spirit
[1:12:42] he he might have really been anointed by
[1:12:43] the genuine spirit of god but down in
[1:12:45] his soul he didn't believe
[1:12:48] he said i danced in it i've done all
[1:12:50] these things
[1:12:51] see i had the spirit on me
[1:12:53] which way did it go
[1:12:55] but he didn't believe
[1:12:57] he didn't recognize
[1:12:59] the word that micah was speaking
[1:13:02] and brother iran said i'm being a son of
[1:13:04] god or a real prophet of god he examined
[1:13:06] his vision
[1:13:08] with the word he looked back to this
[1:13:10] book he looked back to god's word that's
[1:13:12] not just an autobiography
[1:13:14] but it's a supernatural book
[1:13:17] and brother ryan said remember it was
[1:13:18] one word that caused the whole mess to
[1:13:20] come eve let's disbelieve one word of
[1:13:23] god
[1:13:24] in the first of the bible one word
[1:13:26] caused the trouble
[1:13:28] jesus come in the middle of the bible
[1:13:30] said man shall live by every word that
[1:13:32] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:13:34] and at the end of the bible said
[1:13:36] whosoever shall take one word out or add
[1:13:38] one word to it
[1:13:39] it's the whole word all the word
[1:13:42] the word of the hour what
[1:13:45] and micah said i seen god setting upon
[1:13:48] the throne he called the delegates of
[1:13:49] heaven said who can we get to go down
[1:13:51] and deceive ahab
[1:13:53] said in one lying spirit come up and
[1:13:56] fell before god
[1:13:59] a liar a lion spirit and where did
[1:14:02] brother brown say that lying spirit came
[1:14:04] from and a lot of different places he
[1:14:05] would say that lion spirit
[1:14:06] came up from hell
[1:14:08] because that's where lion spirits come
[1:14:10] from anything that's not the truth
[1:14:13] comes from hell
[1:14:15] now now you think about that
[1:14:17] sometimes it's it's human that we're
[1:14:19] talking about listening to truth truth
[1:14:22] and sometimes
[1:14:23] many times it's human nature to not want
[1:14:26] the truth
[1:14:27] that we'll we'll listen it's like almost
[1:14:29] inclination to just
[1:14:31] not not want to hear somebody tell you
[1:14:32] the truth
[1:14:34] somebody somebody will say something
[1:14:35] about your behavior or or the way that
[1:14:37] you act or whatever even even sometimes
[1:14:40] maybe maybe we we don't want to hear the
[1:14:41] truth about our children we'd rather
[1:14:44] we'd rather listen to the lie of our
[1:14:46] that our children tell us than to have a
[1:14:48] holy ghost field uh believer come around
[1:14:50] and say well your kids are not doing
[1:14:52] right or your kids are smoking pot or
[1:14:54] your kids are living in adultery or kids
[1:14:56] are going around in the in the church
[1:14:58] parking lot kissing people between
[1:15:00] services or whatever it might be i'm
[1:15:01] just i'm just coming up with examples
[1:15:04] i'm just saying listen i'm speaking
[1:15:06] truth
[1:15:07] will you bear with me as i speak truth
[1:15:08] because because truth is what we want
[1:15:12] and listen a lot of times a lot of times
[1:15:14] you know a lion spirit a lot of lions a
[1:15:16] lot what is a lion spirit a lion spirit
[1:15:18] will get on somebody to cover up
[1:15:20] something
[1:15:21] to cover up to cover cover-ups to
[1:15:23] conceal something
[1:15:31] you know
[1:15:32] herod got so offended when john the
[1:15:34] baptist told him the truth
[1:15:36] he was telling the truth and and he he
[1:15:38] began to preach marriage and divorce to
[1:15:40] him and herod herod didn't want to hear
[1:15:41] that truth because he was it would he
[1:15:43] he'd rather he would rather listen to a
[1:15:45] lie from somebody and live in his
[1:15:47] condition of sin than have somebody tell
[1:15:49] him the truth
[1:15:52] why is it human nature to prefer a lie
[1:15:55] over the truth
[1:15:56] maybe that's a question to meditate on
[1:15:59] we'd rather hear a lie out of somebody's
[1:16:01] mouth if it'll make our life more
[1:16:03] convenient it'll if it'll make more
[1:16:05] things easier for us
[1:16:08] a lie is some an untrue statement with
[1:16:11] an intent to deceive a lie something to
[1:16:14] with an intent to cover i remember i i
[1:16:15] was i was telling my family the other
[1:16:17] day i remember when i was young and i'd
[1:16:19] get in trouble and i didn't have the
[1:16:20] holy ghost and i could lie
[1:16:22] i'd lie i'd lie to my mom and she'd say
[1:16:25] she'd say well bob did you do
[1:16:27] such-and-such
[1:16:28] no and i could look her in the face and
[1:16:30] eye like a rug i could lie
[1:16:33] and then you know going on and then my
[1:16:35] kids would come around and they'd you
[1:16:37] know i would i i yes i'm gonna preach on
[1:16:39] y'all
[1:16:40] they'd come around and i'd i'd ask i'd
[1:16:42] ask him but did we'd ask did you do
[1:16:45] something like did you do such thing no
[1:16:48] no they they lie
[1:16:51] they'd lie and you see see now listen
[1:16:53] now i'm gonna tell you the truth
[1:16:55] if a holy ghost feel believer or
[1:16:58] minister comes around and points out
[1:16:59] something
[1:17:00] you better take a step back and evaluate
[1:17:02] things
[1:17:04] because your kids if they're not if
[1:17:06] they're not filled with the holy ghost
[1:17:08] they're going to lie
[1:17:10] if they're not filled with the holy
[1:17:12] ghost a little kid running around is
[1:17:13] going to snatch a cookie off the counter
[1:17:15] and say no i didn't get it are they
[1:17:17] going to
[1:17:18] put a big old dent in your car driving
[1:17:20] around and say no that wasn't me that
[1:17:22] did it
[1:17:24] and they'll they'll have it down so
[1:17:27] perfect where they can grin and look at
[1:17:29] you in the face and say
[1:17:30] no i did i didn't do it and what is it
[1:17:33] it's you know if you were if you're
[1:17:35] really living right you don't have to
[1:17:37] lie
[1:17:38] or even if you're even if you're not
[1:17:40] living right just just telling the truth
[1:17:42] will set you free if you know if you
[1:17:45] know there's a problem in your life
[1:17:47] think about how much freedom you would
[1:17:48] have if you just come right out and open
[1:17:50] say well you know i got this problem i'm
[1:17:51] dealing with i got a temper or whatever
[1:17:53] and just just say
[1:17:55] pray for me i got a temper and i don't
[1:17:57] like it i i ran into a car at
[1:18:00] work and i dinged up the the bumper or
[1:18:02] whatever and
[1:18:03] i it caused a big old mess and i i just
[1:18:05] i just need y'all to pray for me and
[1:18:07] just tell the truth just speak truth but
[1:18:10] you see what the devil is a lying spirit
[1:18:12] that that lying spirit that came up
[1:18:15] against micah where did it come from
[1:18:18] it didn't come from heaven
[1:18:20] it came from hell
[1:18:21] and any lion spirit because anything
[1:18:23] that's contrary to the truth the truth
[1:18:26] is from heaven a lie is from hell when
[1:18:29] pilate was standing there talking to
[1:18:30] jesus and he was asking he said what is
[1:18:32] truth a truth was standing there right
[1:18:35] in front of him and anything contrary to
[1:18:37] the truth is a lie and that lie come
[1:18:39] from the devil and the lie is to deceive
[1:18:42] a lie is to twist the truth a lie is to
[1:18:44] distort things so that you don't find
[1:18:47] out the truth
[1:18:49] isn't that what the devil did in the
[1:18:50] garden was distort the truth so that eve
[1:18:52] wouldn't have power over him and that's
[1:18:55] why that's what the lion spirit does it
[1:18:57] distorts the truth to keep the young
[1:19:00] people from being free it'll distort the
[1:19:02] truth from keeping your home in order
[1:19:04] that's why a lion's spirit will get on
[1:19:07] some adulterous person or somebody and
[1:19:08] they'll come home and say no i wasn't at
[1:19:10] that place
[1:19:11] no you can't look at my phone no
[1:19:16] but let's search things out and prove
[1:19:17] them
[1:19:22] and you know what the devil will do
[1:19:25] the devil get on some young people and
[1:19:26] make them do something and tell lies
[1:19:28] about it to cover up and get them get
[1:19:30] them get them in a horrible place he'll
[1:19:31] get it make a young person do something
[1:19:34] horrible get him off
[1:19:36] do something terrible and then he'll
[1:19:38] turn around and point that finger right
[1:19:40] back at you and say look what you did
[1:19:43] and then
[1:19:44] he'll make you hate yourself
[1:19:46] he'll make you get feel so rotten and so
[1:19:49] terrible now you know there's a there's
[1:19:51] a remedy for that the remedy is to run
[1:19:53] to the feet of the cross remedy there's
[1:19:55] a remedy here
[1:19:57] laying in these words
[1:19:59] because this ain't just an autobiography
[1:20:01] this these are the words of eternal life
[1:20:03] and there's a there's a remedy for that
[1:20:05] when you get in that spot and now look
[1:20:07] what the devil will do the devil will
[1:20:09] make you sometimes he'll make you start
[1:20:11] hating yourself so bad that you'll get
[1:20:13] in your claws and you'll i hate myself
[1:20:15] and you start cutting on yourself you'll
[1:20:17] start slight doing stuff that that don't
[1:20:19] make no sense and then maybe your mom
[1:20:20] and daddy will find out and what what
[1:20:22] does mama what's mama and daddy's
[1:20:23] reaction a lot of times when they find
[1:20:25] out they're kids of god in the pit of
[1:20:27] despair and the devil's making them beat
[1:20:30] up on their self and make them hate
[1:20:32] themselves the mama and daddy a lot of
[1:20:34] times they they react without wisdom
[1:20:36] and they get all they get they start
[1:20:38] yelling and and scream what's wrong with
[1:20:41] you
[1:20:42] what will i tell you what's wrong with
[1:20:44] you the devil
[1:20:46] has got them in the pit of despair
[1:20:49] and what you need to show them in that
[1:20:50] moment
[1:20:51] is not to to drop an anvil on their head
[1:20:54] but you need to love them show them some
[1:20:56] love and and lead them lead them to god
[1:20:58] and tell them tell them now listen i
[1:21:00] know the world it looks like the world's
[1:21:02] against you i know everything this ain't
[1:21:04] in my notes
[1:21:05] it looks like the world's against you
[1:21:07] and everything's against you but but
[1:21:08] there's a god in heaven that loves you
[1:21:10] and i love you
[1:21:12] you know you know you should you should
[1:21:14] always have your home set up as to be
[1:21:16] like a sanctuary for the young people so
[1:21:18] that they know no matter what they do
[1:21:21] this is what i've always told my kids no
[1:21:22] matter when they were
[1:21:24] doing things they should no matter what
[1:21:26] you do or where you go
[1:21:28] you don't ever forget that your mama and
[1:21:30] daddy love you
[1:21:32] and you always have a sanctuary here in
[1:21:34] this home no matter what you do you can
[1:21:36] always come back here because this is a
[1:21:39] place when the world gives you lemons
[1:21:41] when the world takes you down and throws
[1:21:43] you in the gutter you can always have a
[1:21:45] place where you can come come back here
[1:21:47] and sit in the rocking chair next to the
[1:21:49] fire and pull up a quilt over you and
[1:21:51] listen to a tape playing in the
[1:21:52] background and hear mama and daddy
[1:21:54] crying out that god will save you why
[1:21:57] because you got to show somebody love
[1:22:00] love is how you win one another
[1:22:05] love will conquer a lion spirit if you
[1:22:07] show somebody that you love them
[1:22:10] it'll change it'll change everything
[1:22:13] now now
[1:22:14] brother brown said now people say signs
[1:22:16] and one look at what a lion spirit is
[1:22:19] he said if people say signs and wonders
[1:22:21] don't follow
[1:22:22] it's a lying spirit
[1:22:24] because it's contrary to the word
[1:22:26] if the bible says people tells you the
[1:22:28] holy ghost ain't in this day the same as
[1:22:30] it was in the other days
[1:22:32] it's a lying spirit
[1:22:34] anything contrary to the word is a lying
[1:22:37] spirit why it because it's anything that
[1:22:40] will take from you a blessing that god
[1:22:43] has given from you or add to you all
[1:22:45] these requirements that you don't need
[1:22:47] to satis to me
[1:22:48] anything that will add to or take from
[1:22:51] the word of god
[1:22:52] is a lie
[1:22:54] it's a lying spirit
[1:22:56] it's them false prophets they're telling
[1:22:58] you a lie if the spirit just says old
[1:23:00] liberation of women and do all these
[1:23:02] other things and go out act like the
[1:23:04] world it's a lying spirit
[1:23:06] it's not lined up with the word stay in
[1:23:08] the word that's right stay right there
[1:23:12] now look look at all these that couldn't
[1:23:13] see it and i'm gonna i'm gonna wind up
[1:23:16] in just a minute he said no caiaphas
[1:23:18] couldn't see it
[1:23:19] and judas couldn't understand it
[1:23:22] but believers can see it
[1:23:24] believers can see why can they see it
[1:23:27] why why could cleopas and his friend not
[1:23:30] see it because they didn't know what the
[1:23:32] word said
[1:23:33] but believers can see it
[1:23:35] because they know what the word says
[1:23:38] believers can look into the word and
[1:23:40] they can recognize the day in the hour
[1:23:41] that we're living in
[1:23:44] now
[1:23:48] yeah let me i'm gonna close right here
[1:23:51] in just a second
[1:23:54] god sent his prophet as his word had
[1:23:56] promised of malachi 3 john the baptist a
[1:23:59] messenger i'll send before my face to
[1:24:00] forerun is his coming
[1:24:02] and watch what his message was now
[1:24:04] brother brown said his message was
[1:24:06] he said watch that foreigner of christ
[1:24:08] in that age watch what he said what
[1:24:09] happened the grain he said i now he said
[1:24:12] in this message this is what brother
[1:24:13] rahm said i hope you're not asleep
[1:24:16] [Laughter]
[1:24:19] he said i hope you're not asleep he said
[1:24:22] the grain is here
[1:24:24] the grain is here it was that bride that
[1:24:26] part of it but what did he say will
[1:24:28] happen to the stalk it'll be burned with
[1:24:30] with quenchable fire
[1:24:32] and notice in luke 17 where he said in
[1:24:34] the last days it'll come like sodom and
[1:24:35] gomorrah again
[1:24:36] have we got it we got sodom and gomorrah
[1:24:39] again
[1:24:41] in luke 17 it says even thus shall it be
[1:24:43] in the day when the son of man is
[1:24:46] revealed when it's back to that sodom
[1:24:48] and gomorrah condition
[1:24:50] and the day brother brahman said in the
[1:24:51] day that the son of man will be revealed
[1:24:53] the world will be in a sodom condition
[1:24:56] we've got it haven't we
[1:24:59] in romans chapter one for this cause
[1:25:01] gave them up unto vile affections for
[1:25:02] even their women to change their natural
[1:25:04] use into that which is against nature
[1:25:06] and likewise also the men leaving the
[1:25:08] natural use of the woman burned in their
[1:25:09] lust one toward another and god gave him
[1:25:12] over to a reparate mind to do those
[1:25:14] things which are not convenient why
[1:25:15] because they they did not want to retain
[1:25:17] god and their knowledge so they turned
[1:25:19] away from god's word and he gave them
[1:25:20] over to a reprobate mind
[1:25:23] so in the age
[1:25:25] of the maturity the maturation of the
[1:25:27] works of the devil
[1:25:29] that's when the son of man will be
[1:25:31] revealed
[1:25:33] when all the devil's works come to this
[1:25:35] mature form
[1:25:37] that's when christ is doing something
[1:25:41] you see how how you can tell by looking
[1:25:43] at god's word what day and hour that
[1:25:44] we're living in
[1:25:46] so how will he be revealed how will the
[1:25:48] son of man be revealed
[1:25:50] how will he be made known how how will a
[1:25:52] believer be able to tail and the rest of
[1:25:55] the world will not be able to tell how
[1:25:56] will you be able to how would you be
[1:25:58] how did you recognize the prophet's
[1:26:00] message as the truth
[1:26:02] how did you how could you tell
[1:26:04] out now brother i said notice how g i'm
[1:26:06] winding up right here notice how jesus
[1:26:08] made himself known to these disciples
[1:26:10] these two disciples cleopas and his
[1:26:13] friend
[1:26:15] he's here the same today
[1:26:17] as he was that day
[1:26:19] and revealing himself more today than he
[1:26:21] has in any other age since that day
[1:26:23] come through the wheat and stalk and
[1:26:25] shuck is all past now we're into the
[1:26:27] wheat again
[1:26:28] see we're back into the grain
[1:26:31] watch how he made himself known to these
[1:26:33] people
[1:26:34] he said now remember as their messiah of
[1:26:36] the promised word of the age
[1:26:39] watch him he refers back
[1:26:41] to the word of god
[1:26:44] he never come right out and told him
[1:26:45] don't you know me i'm the messiah that's
[1:26:47] resurrected he never said that
[1:26:50] see he just give them the scripture
[1:26:53] like john did and the rest of them see
[1:26:55] they have to pick that out themselves
[1:26:59] that leaves a job for you and i
[1:27:01] that you gotta you gotta discern
[1:27:05] whether it's true or not
[1:27:08] they have to judge for themselves
[1:27:11] now brother brown said again now don't
[1:27:12] go to sleep
[1:27:14] judge for yourself
[1:27:17] judge for yourself
[1:27:19] he said he as john let the word of the
[1:27:21] bible identify and what he was to them
[1:27:24] that should have been plain enough
[1:27:27] if the word had identified him that
[1:27:29] should be plainly who the promise was
[1:27:31] they was looking at
[1:27:33] now wouldn't you love to have been like
[1:27:36] you you say to fly on the wall to to
[1:27:38] listen to just kind of buzz along next
[1:27:40] to cleopas and his friend and jesus walk
[1:27:43] down the road
[1:27:44] wouldn't that be wonderful to be able to
[1:27:46] do to listen to that conversation
[1:27:48] do you believe that because listening to
[1:27:51] a prophet you can go back and understand
[1:27:54] what
[1:27:55] jesus told him
[1:27:56] that's actually what brother brown said
[1:27:58] in this sermon he said now let's let's
[1:28:00] listen
[1:28:02] to the words that he quoted
[1:28:05] think about that you can listen to a
[1:28:07] sermon and brother brown can replay to
[1:28:09] you
[1:28:10] the scriptures and the topics and the
[1:28:12] things that jesus told
[1:28:14] these two these two brothers as these
[1:28:17] two friends as they walked down the road
[1:28:19] he said
[1:28:20] would you like to hear what he said to
[1:28:22] them
[1:28:24] let's just carry their conversation
[1:28:27] everybody's awake now
[1:28:30] so this is what brother brown said that
[1:28:32] jesus said as he walked next to cleopas
[1:28:35] and his friend who did not recognize
[1:28:38] that jesus
[1:28:39] was in their midst
[1:28:41] that god was in flesh
[1:28:44] he said he started off the the bible
[1:28:46] says he started off with moses he
[1:28:48] started off with deuteronomy 18 15 and
[1:28:50] i'm going to be closing that after this
[1:28:51] he said
[1:28:52] deuteronomy 18 15 says the lord thy god
[1:28:54] will raise up unto thee a prophet from
[1:28:56] the midst of thee of thy brother and
[1:28:57] like unto me unto him ye shall hearken
[1:29:00] and zechariah 11. now brother raham said
[1:29:02] these are the things that jesus told
[1:29:04] cleopas and his friend
[1:29:06] zachariah 11 says and i said unto them
[1:29:08] if you think good give me my price and
[1:29:10] if not for bear so they weighed for my
[1:29:11] price 30 pieces of silver
[1:29:15] and psalm 41 says yea my unfamiliar
[1:29:17] friend and whom i trusted which did eat
[1:29:19] of my bread hath lifted up his heel
[1:29:21] against me
[1:29:22] and zechariah 13 says a wake-up sword
[1:29:24] against my shepherd
[1:29:27] and against the man that is my fellow
[1:29:30] saith the lord of hosts smite the
[1:29:31] shepherd and the sheep shall be
[1:29:32] scattered and i will turn my hand upon
[1:29:34] the little ones
[1:29:36] psalm 35 says false witnesses did rise
[1:29:39] up they laid to my charge things that i
[1:29:41] knew not now think about jesus as he's
[1:29:43] walking and he's he's he's where's he
[1:29:46] going black to the word and he's pulling
[1:29:48] out of the word these scriptures that
[1:29:51] paint a picture of who he is
[1:29:53] and as these words bit as the story
[1:29:56] unfolds they begin to realize
[1:29:58] that he's in their midst
[1:30:01] isaiah 53 says he was oppressed and he
[1:30:04] was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:30:05] mouth he is brought as a lamb to the
[1:30:07] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[1:30:09] shearers is dumb so he openeth and not
[1:30:11] his mouth
[1:30:12] isaiah 50 says i i gave my back to the
[1:30:15] smiters and my cheeks to them that
[1:30:17] plucked off the hair i hid not my face
[1:30:20] from shame and spitting
[1:30:22] psalm 22 says to the chief musician
[1:30:25] a psalm of david my god my god why hast
[1:30:28] thou forsaken me why thou so far from
[1:30:31] helping me and from the words of my
[1:30:32] roaring isaiah 9 says for unto us a
[1:30:35] child is born unto us a son is given and
[1:30:37] the government shall be upon his
[1:30:39] shoulder and his name shall be called
[1:30:41] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[1:30:43] everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:30:45] and psalm 22 says they part my garments
[1:30:47] among them and cast lots upon my vesture
[1:30:50] isaiah chapter 7 says therefore the lord
[1:30:52] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[1:30:55] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:30:57] shall call his name emmanuel
[1:30:59] psalm 22 says all they that see me laugh
[1:31:01] me this corn
[1:31:03] they shoot out the lip they shake the
[1:31:04] head saying he trusted on the lord that
[1:31:06] he would deliver him
[1:31:07] let him deliver him seeing he delighted
[1:31:09] in him
[1:31:10] psalm 22 14 to 18 says i am poured out
[1:31:13] like water and all my bones are out of
[1:31:15] joint my heart is like wax it is melted
[1:31:18] in the midst of my bowels my strength is
[1:31:20] dried up like a potsherd and my tongue
[1:31:22] cleaveth through my jaws and that has
[1:31:24] brought me into the dust of death for
[1:31:26] dogs have come past me the assembly of
[1:31:28] the wicked have enclosed me they pierced
[1:31:29] my hands and my feet i may tell all my
[1:31:32] bones they look and stare upon me
[1:31:34] they part my garments among them and
[1:31:36] cast lots upon my vesture
[1:31:38] and all these things
[1:31:40] were what jesus told cleopas and his
[1:31:42] friend
[1:31:43] and brother branham replayed all these
[1:31:45] things in this sermon he listed out all
[1:31:48] these scriptures that jesus quoted to
[1:31:50] them
[1:31:51] isaiah 53 says therefore will i divide
[1:31:54] with him a portion with a great and he
[1:31:56] shall divide the spoil with the strong
[1:31:58] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:31:59] death and he was numbered with the
[1:32:01] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:32:03] many and made intercession for the
[1:32:04] transgressions and isaiah 53 9 says and
[1:32:08] he made his grave with the wicked and
[1:32:09] with the rich in his death because he
[1:32:11] had done no violence
[1:32:12] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:32:14] psalm 16 says for thou will not leave my
[1:32:17] soul in hell neither will thou suffer
[1:32:18] thine holy one to see corruption and
[1:32:20] malachi 3 says
[1:32:23] behold i will send my messenger and he
[1:32:26] shall prepare the way before me and the
[1:32:28] lord whom you seek shall suddenly come
[1:32:30] to his temple even the messenger of the
[1:32:33] covenant whom you delight in behold he
[1:32:35] shall come saith the lord of hosts
[1:32:38] and he said it was now
[1:32:40] that they began to see
[1:32:42] who had fulfilled these scriptures that
[1:32:44] was promised of that day
[1:32:46] it was then after it was late they began
[1:32:49] to see
[1:32:50] as the day grew down and that sun began
[1:32:52] to sink the evening light began to come
[1:32:54] on and wha what are the evening lights
[1:32:57] the evening lights will shine in this in

[1:33:24] god and see what the word says about you
[1:33:28] that you can recognize your place in the
[1:33:30] word that you traveled the same journey
[1:33:32] that abe abraham did you came the same
[1:33:34] way that ruth did you came the same
[1:33:36] journey that david did that you did not
[1:33:39] disbelieve the word like eve did and you
[1:33:41] you came through all these battles and
[1:33:43] things like the children of israel did
[1:33:45] through the wilderness and you came into
[1:33:47] the promised land of the rest of the
[1:33:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:50] he said they knew you because see they
[1:33:52] hadn't been briefed
[1:33:54] on the scriptures
[1:33:56] but if you believe if you look into the
[1:33:58] scriptures and you believe
