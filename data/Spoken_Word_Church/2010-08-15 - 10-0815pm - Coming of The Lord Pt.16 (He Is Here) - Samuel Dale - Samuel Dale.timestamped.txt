[30:50] Prosperity Blessed Be he that in the
[30:53] name of the Lord we have blessed you out
[30:56] of the house of the Lord okay let's go
[31:00] over now to John very familiar scripture
[31:02] with all of
[31:06] us John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[31:09] word and the Word was with God and the
[31:11] Word was God the same was in the
[31:14] beginning with God all things were made
[31:17] by what by the word all right all things
[31:20] were made by him and without him was not
[31:22] anything made that was made in him was
[31:25] life and the life was the light of men
[31:28] and the light shineth in darkness and
[31:29] the Darkness comprehended it not now
[31:32] look over at verse 14 it says and the
[31:34] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[31:38] now why couldn't man comprehend
[31:42] it they couldn't comprehend it why
[31:45] couldn't
[31:47] he cuz they was looking at it in the
[31:49] wrong way the word was made flesh and
[31:50] dwelt among us we beheld his glory as
[31:53] the glory of the only begotten of the
[31:54] father full of grace and truth you may
[31:57] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[31:59] the reading of the word
[32:03] now I want to try today to just more or
[32:07] less preach a sermon to uh kind
[32:11] of uh go back and cover what we've been
[32:15] talking
[32:16] about and bring it down to uh the
[32:20] present time and that way maybe it will
[32:23] be helpful and if there's any questions
[32:25] and answers I I enjoy questions and
[32:28] answers I I ask for them I love to to do
[32:31] that and uh you know if you have any
[32:33] questions if just write it down brother
[32:35] Dale what in the world you talking about
[32:38] I don't bother me at all I just tell you
[32:40] what I'm talking about you know but uh
[32:42] you know if you have any questions don't
[32:44] worry about asking it and don't worry
[32:46] about it being a dumb question there's
[32:48] never been a dumb question there's been
[32:50] a bunch of us dumb people tried to
[32:51] answer them but there's never been a
[32:53] question that was dumb because it's
[32:55] something that's on your heart and your
[32:56] mind am m me you know so something you
[32:59] want to know about and you know so make
[33:02] sure you do that
[33:05] now that part that's used there in John
[33:09] 1 where it says in the beginning was the
[33:12] word and the Word was with
[33:15] God a lot of people has used that to try
[33:19] to prove to Gods CU see there is With
[33:23] God all right but the next part of it
[33:25] says and what and the Word was
[33:29] God they said well what about that word
[33:31] with you know I had never looked it up
[33:33] because it didn't bother me and never
[33:36] even really tried to look it up to see
[33:38] what the the definition of with really
[33:41] means and uh you know I was looking at
[33:45] it a few minutes ago and I thought well
[33:47] you know I never looked that up in the
[33:48] dictionary to just see it's got a lot of
[33:51] meaning to the word with but uh let's
[33:54] see if I can read my own
[33:56] writing
[33:59] wi is a
[34:01] word used as a function f you MCT i o n
[34:07] function word to
[34:10] indicate one that shares see to indicate
[34:14] now point out in other words shares in
[34:17] an action transaction or an
[34:21] arrangement that's what the word with is
[34:24] a it's a function word a function word
[34:26] is a uh a word expressing relationship
[34:30] right all right see I just never looked
[34:33] that up cuz it didn't matter to me cuz I
[34:34] knew it wasn't meaning to Gods but I
[34:37] knew that it had a meaning but it's it's
[34:40] it's actually indicating or in other
[34:42] words pointing
[34:44] at you know showing that there is an
[34:48] arrangement taking place a transaction
[34:51] is going on something is
[34:54] happening that we need to playay
[34:56] attention to amen and then we can share
[34:59] in it all right now you'll see in a
[35:02] minute why I was using that to the point
[35:05] but now what I want to do is I just I've
[35:07] been talking about the coming of the
[35:08] Lord and we know that it took 4,000
[35:11] years for him to complete his coming and
[35:15] that was completed by him coming into
[35:18] human flesh see they're back in the
[35:21] beginning and I believe then it shows us
[35:25] the second coming of Jesus Christ is to
[35:28] be what we we've been talking about for
[35:31] quite a while as the bride coming of
[35:33] Christ or in other words God coming in
[35:36] you right that started on the day of
[35:39] Pentecost and uh you know will climax in
[35:43] the
[35:44] Rapture of the church because we go to
[35:46] meet him in the A and he does not become
[35:49] physically you know visibly physical
[35:52] right
[35:53] way he becomes visible in this fact of
[35:56] Revelation but not in the facts of you
[35:59] know hitting on wood showing how stle it
[36:02] is or anything like that because we meet
[36:04] him in the a so we don't want to break
[36:06] the scriptures and try to say well he's
[36:09] he's physical he say well and that's
[36:11] what your Prophet said that the
[36:13] Pentecostal people that said they had uh
[36:17] blood on their foreheads and and oil on
[36:19] their hands and all kind of things he
[36:21] said they don't realize that they are
[36:24] contrary to the scriptures because that
[36:28] if you have the blood you would have to
[36:31] have the person here that the blood was
[36:35] in all right so that's you know that's
[36:38] his point of of a good way of expressing
[36:41] it but now I want to do that I want to
[36:43] just go back and and let's just take a
[36:46] little run through in the Bible and just
[36:49] uh you know look at some things and
[36:51] finish it up on this part and then if
[36:53] you have questions we'll try to cover
[36:55] them Wednesday uh or any other time now
[36:59] as I said the coming of the
[37:02] Lord that's why we kept reading from
[37:06] Isaiah blessed is he that cometh in the
[37:09] name of the Lord that's been our thought
[37:12] you know all the way
[37:13] through now I express that to you and I
[37:16] won't say but just a word because I've
[37:18] done it on many services throughout it
[37:20] but not to lose
[37:22] some uh to me to send Wade in my name is
[37:26] fine but all is present is my name right
[37:31] the someone is having to honor me in my
[37:34] name and and see that's not what it
[37:37] was God didn't send the son to come down
[37:43] to take his place right all right he
[37:46] wouldn't be a just God to do that right
[37:49] see he came himself right but the way he
[37:53] came it did it hid it from mankind so
[37:56] much until they're they're not able to
[37:59] see it but he was standing there up on
[38:01] the earth and he said if you've seen me
[38:03] you've seen my father that's
[38:05] right that's that's no problem you know
[38:08] it's just to read the Simplicity and see
[38:10] if I guess probably when I was in the
[38:12] Baptist I was more Oneness than I was
[38:16] trinitarian because I would argue with
[38:18] people about that and most of you if you
[38:21] didn't know it the basic Baptist
[38:23] Doctrine is one God but it is expressed
[38:27] th as God in three persons Blessed
[38:29] Trinity which is just trinitarian it's
[38:31] like anything else but when as I tell
[38:33] you when brother Mo said that to me one
[38:35] day he said what do you see about God I
[38:37] said one true and living God he said
[38:39] explain it I said God and three person
[38:40] Blessed Trinity cuz that's all the words
[38:42] I had he said you're as much Trinity as
[38:45] they are I said explain it sir he said
[38:48] well a person's a personality
[38:49] personality is an individual individual
[38:51] is a
[38:52] person yeah he said well you got treated
[38:55] like everybody else I looked at him it
[38:56] didn't take me no 6 months it didn't
[38:58] take a whole you know rig of marar I
[39:00] didn't have to go home and study about
[39:02] it I looked at and said I don't believe
[39:03] that no more right I didn't I didn't
[39:06] believe that anymore that was in D that
[39:08] took care of the problem with that now I
[39:10] didn't know how to explain it but it did
[39:12] take care of them three
[39:14] persons I could see that much all right
[39:17] but now see the coming of the Lord
[39:19] actually started way before the
[39:22] foundation of the world Amen that's
[39:24] right because God in his mind he had uh
[39:28] you know as he was D as Elohim the
[39:31] self-existing one right and that would
[39:33] do away with trinitarianism but but he
[39:36] was there as the self-existing one but
[39:39] he had in his mind thoughts he wanted to
[39:42] be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he
[39:45] wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to
[39:48] have a family right amen all right so he
[39:51] started a form of showing what he was
[39:54] going to do he goes through the creation
[39:56] of the world and I
[39:58] spent many years ago I spent months
[40:01] preaching out of the Book of Revelation
[40:03] on the the de the days of creation the
[40:06] six and taking each one you know to show
[40:09] what it was doing but what it was doing
[40:11] was showing that God wanted to become
[40:14] visible amen he's never wanted to be
[40:16] self-existing he wants to exist with his
[40:20] family right right but he had to bring
[40:24] his family into being right all right so
[40:28] he starts out and showing a beautiful
[40:30] picture of what he wants because he
[40:33] brings a world he brings all of the
[40:34] things down and he's the the word Lo the
[40:39] word logos or speech is used back there
[40:42] in Genesis and and even your scholar
[40:44] Scofield he shows you that the Son of
[40:47] God was the word of God that come out of
[40:51] God in the beginning right I mean the
[40:53] scholars know that because they they but
[40:56] then turn around and make a Trinity out
[40:57] of it because see see it was not his day
[41:00] and time but yet see as it was that the
[41:05] we look at it as one two three persons
[41:08] or whatever the persons or whatever I
[41:10] talked with a man one day about it and
[41:11] he said well I see it now I see it
[41:14] there's not three Gods I said hey I'm
[41:18] glad you see it he said yeah there's
[41:20] just
[41:22] two he said there's a father and a son
[41:25] oh my I said well
[41:28] we talked long enough to got rid of one
[41:30] of them let's just talk a while see if
[41:32] we get rid of one more and get you right
[41:34] but I wasn't making lot of him CU I came
[41:38] through that I knew right where he's at
[41:40] but now you think about it see that God
[41:42] in his mind he wanted all of these
[41:45] things to take place right but he had to
[41:50] to in that form of knowing he also knew
[41:54] that if he created you and I
[41:57] and he put us on a free moral
[41:59] agency that we would fall amen if he
[42:03] didn't know that he not God so what are
[42:05] you talking about a peanut brain God or
[42:07] something this don't understand as much
[42:09] as you understand you know that's the
[42:11] way the kids are and all the kids think
[42:13] you understand more than your mom and
[42:14] daddy well that's the way as humans are
[42:17] we think we know more about things than
[42:18] God does but just now keeping mind so in
[42:22] his in his creation he began to express
[42:25] himself and then he last he created man
[42:29] and he created him first in a spiritual
[42:32] being and and said now in the let us
[42:36] make man in our own likeness and all and
[42:39] as he created in a spiritual man see
[42:43] then that spiritual man was in the
[42:46] garden to control the animals and things
[42:48] but still God was lonely because that
[42:52] was not the finish of his desires
[42:55] because he could not be a Healer there
[42:56] or or anything like that because there
[42:59] was nothing wrong but he knew as quick
[43:02] as he put us in flesh that we would fall
[43:07] well he didn't make us
[43:08] fall he just knew we would now if you
[43:11] say he didn't know that we would fall
[43:13] then I say you got to peanut bring God
[43:16] that's the best way to say it I'm sorry
[43:18] I'm not hateful I'm truthful you know I
[43:21] just talk that way at least you don't
[43:23] worry about what I'm saying you know
[43:25] what I'm saying all right but in his
[43:27] creation see which came first the
[43:30] Creator or the creation that's right so
[43:34] you would naturally know that the
[43:35] Creator came
[43:37] first and he started his
[43:40] condescending
[43:42] downward to reveal himself to us because
[43:45] that's what he wanted to do it was not
[43:47] just his plan to be a Healer now listen
[43:50] to I'm point to be a savior to be a
[43:55] redeemer it was was not even just his
[43:58] full plan to be a father right or
[44:01] anything like
[44:02] that he wanted to come and
[44:07] live not just with a group of
[44:10] people he wanted to come and live in a
[44:14] group of people it's always been the
[44:16] plan you say well how you know cuz
[44:17] that's what he done in
[44:19] Genesis cuz he took that part of him you
[44:22] got to admit in Genesis 1 there where it
[44:23] said let us make man that when he made
[44:26] that man that was a spiritual man but
[44:28] Genesis 2 then he made the natural man
[44:30] that's right all right then he put the
[44:32] spiritual man of Genesis 1 which was
[44:35] eternal
[44:36] life your Prophet said Adam had eternal
[44:39] life God breed into his nostrils right
[44:41] but now he gave him eternal life now
[44:44] when the fall came he couldn't breathe
[44:45] eternal life into man anymore because it
[44:48] would make Eternal Sinners and that
[44:50] would not be God okay but see then when
[44:52] it happened then the Creator could look
[44:55] down and see his creation
[44:58] but yet still he was not capable of of
[45:02] of communicating exactly the way he
[45:04] wanted to be with that with that people
[45:09] see he he doesn't want to just as I said
[45:12] be with
[45:13] us you know or that we worship
[45:18] him right he wanted us to be a part of
[45:22] him or to be him made manifest amen that
[45:26] doesn't do away with him it's not like
[45:29] trying to give out his brother Mo used
[45:31] to explain it you know we look at it
[45:32] like giving out God like cutting up an
[45:34] apple you know you give away the pieces
[45:36] you run out of
[45:38] apple see that's not it because that
[45:40] would run out of God right it's not that
[45:44] way see the more he gives away the
[45:46] greater he gets right that's the
[45:50] understanding see all
[45:52] right now to be the Creator now I'm
[45:55] making some points so Point okay when I
[45:59] say I make a point there I better
[46:03] listen my point is that in the fact that
[46:08] he is the
[46:11] creator then he would have to be there
[46:15] more
[46:16] real or be more real than what he
[46:19] created right is that
[46:22] sensible that shouldn't be any problem
[46:25] you know just playing language right
[46:28] that the one who created would have to
[46:30] be create greater than the creation so
[46:33] as he did then I'm wanting you to keep
[46:36] this in mind because he then would be
[46:40] present right in each stage if you
[46:43] brought him down you know and you bring
[46:45] him as Elohim and he's self-existing you
[46:48] try to draw it out in a picture and then
[46:50] you see another step forward maybe
[46:52] coming towards man and you seeing word
[46:54] logos Etc and then you see him speak and
[46:58] see if you draw all of that out just
[47:00] remember it's the same person but this
[47:03] is the way we think we think he stepped
[47:07] down and there's a hole back
[47:10] there and he stepped in another stage
[47:12] and there's another
[47:14] hole you
[47:16] know that's you know I know what brother
[47:20] randam says and I believe it he said all
[47:23] God was and he said all means all but
[47:27] see preachers take that and they just
[47:29] all and all and all and all all all all
[47:31] they just keep
[47:32] going well you better remember what you
[47:35] doing if all God was he poured into
[47:38] Christ there's no more
[47:42] God and if all Christ was he pours into
[47:44] the church it's no more Christ right so
[47:47] you're right in the devil's trap that's
[47:48] trying to get you to believe you're God
[47:50] right
[47:52] right see just because the scripture
[47:54] will tell you in him dwelt the fullness
[47:57] of the godhead
[47:58] bodily and we believe
[48:01] that that's what's to be revealed here
[48:04] right but the prophet said he give us a
[48:07] message of cheer down through the
[48:08] endless
[48:10] ages in eternity all right so then
[48:13] there's more of God to learn in
[48:15] eternity so we better get our little
[48:17] words right yeah all is
[48:21] all like I said take a glass of water
[48:24] pour it over to another glass pour it
[48:26] over another glass and you got a bunch
[48:28] of empty
[48:29] glasses so just remember God can step
[48:33] down
[48:34] here and he can be right down here with
[48:37] us
[48:38] right and him and the devil's up in
[48:40] heaven
[48:42] talking amen that's right now I don't
[48:45] get so spiritual see that's what
[48:48] everybody does they want to
[48:50] spiritualize inside of me is where God
[48:53] is at well then there's the devil in
[48:56] there
[49:00] the devil can't be in your soul at the
[49:02] same time God is in your soul right
[49:04] right all right see where your language
[49:06] falls apart and I know ah you're just
[49:09] smart it well there's one thing about it
[49:11] get the fix seed in the F Holy Ghost can
[49:14] Quicken it that's right now let's move
[49:16] on if we believe him to
[49:19] be Hebrews
[49:23] 138 then whatever he was he is and shall
[49:26] always be amen so when he was Elohim the
[49:31] self-existing
[49:32] one then he was Hebrews 13:8 right all
[49:38] right now wherever he moves down through
[49:41] to reveal himself he must still be
[49:44] Hebrews 13:8 right right all right so
[49:49] then if we believe that we have zoee
[49:52] God's own life surely we would believe
[49:56] that God had that
[49:57] life all right and Zoe means
[50:01] what it's just like say using Elohim Zoe
[50:04] in things means like ever present for
[50:07] eternity it means Hebrews 13:8 whatever
[50:10] he was he is and will always
[50:12] be we change right God don't change
[50:17] right that's our problem so we don't see
[50:20] him as being as he's condescending that
[50:23] each stage of his condescending whether
[50:26] it be the great existing Elohim or
[50:28] whether he makes a step downward to be
[50:31] the word that that means that that is
[50:33] the same almighty
[50:36] God and it means he's present so don't
[50:39] forget that now don't forget that he's
[50:42] always present am
[50:45] right he's an always present God am now
[50:50] see God begins to reveal himself now
[50:53] remember the psalmist we're reading
[50:55] blessed he that that cometh in the name
[50:57] of the Lord your Prophet said one day
[51:00] blessed is he that believes that God has
[51:03] comeing this amen which was the
[51:05] revealing of the word through him amen
[51:08] all right see brother randam wanted us
[51:10] to see God is real no Prophet ever spoke
[51:15] of a God in heaven right now brother D
[51:19] got scripture where it says when J said
[51:21] Scot in heav you're not
[51:24] listening that's it that's words of
[51:28] expression Moses said God is not up in
[51:31] heaven that one should go there he's not
[51:33] over the sea that one should go
[51:36] there he couldn't Express the whole
[51:38] point of his sin of what he was talking
[51:40] about so Paul picks it up and he says
[51:43] what he's not in thee not thee in thy
[51:47] mouth in thy heart the word of faith
[51:49] that we
[51:50] preach God had a burning bush for Moses
[51:54] to stand in front of right right and he
[51:58] met God personally we talk about it and
[52:00] that one for 5 minutes in the presence
[52:03] the prophet said of the pillar of fire
[52:05] meant more than all the 40 Years of his
[52:07] mother telling him that he was to be the
[52:09] deliverer of
[52:11] Israel because it was something personal
[52:14] right he told him there at the burning
[52:16] bush he said go down to Egypt and get my
[52:19] people he
[52:21] said I'm not
[52:24] going he said go get my
[52:27] people he said well who am I going to
[52:29] tell them sent me he said tell them
[52:32] about the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[52:34] he said listen I know about Abraham I
[52:35] know about Isaac I know about Jacob I
[52:37] know there was a god there but that's
[52:39] not going to I'm not going to Egypt
[52:41] getting my head cut
[52:43] off right I try to paraphrase things you
[52:45] get to listen at it but when he said
[52:48] listen I am that I am
[52:55] right I'm ready to go go to
[52:58] Egypt why cuz he had something for
[53:01] himself right right that was real no
[53:04] Prophet ever spoke of a god somewhere
[53:07] else he spoke even as though he was that
[53:10] God Amen that's
[53:13] right that's why the language and the
[53:15] wording sometime they're actually
[53:17] speaking look at the psalmist they
[53:20] pierce my hands and my feet right yeah
[53:24] so much caught up in the spirit of God
[53:27] until it just like he was going through
[53:28] a great crucifixion think about that I'm
[53:32] sure he's sitting out there sweating and
[53:33] screaming in a holling running all over
[53:35] the place cuz he could almost feel the
[53:38] pain it was so
[53:40] real but see God has always wanted us to
[53:44] see that he was real amen that's right
[53:47] God has always wanted us to see that
[53:49] he's with us amen I know I speak funny
[53:52] I'm sorry but just I don't have no
[53:54] education to explain what I talk about
[53:56] so I just have to explain to where I can
[53:58] right a god up in heaven is no good come
[54:04] on you're no more than a totem pole come
[54:08] on right now brother D I'll have you to
[54:14] understand if you don't have a present
[54:16] god with you what kind of a god do you
[54:20] have you might as well get you an idle
[54:22] put it in your pocket and carry it with
[54:24] you oh oh no I believe in a living God
[54:30] where's he at he's up in
[54:33] heaven well there's not a religion in
[54:35] the world that doesn't believe in some
[54:37] form of afterlife or some form of a
[54:40] heaven or whatever the words may be
[54:42] different glory land you know on the old
[54:45] endan was looking for the promised land
[54:47] to come you know and all of the
[54:49] things yeah happy hunting
[54:51] ground but see Church my point is one
[54:55] thing
[54:58] if we are a creation of
[55:02] God and that's your if not
[55:06] M then he's always
[55:09] here he was back there I loved that
[55:12] today I heard the prophet say that in
[55:14] all of the problems that Israel had s
[55:17] him 10 times before they ever got him
[55:19] out of Egypt just a little piece you
[55:21] know when they got over to kades Baria
[55:23] he was still ready to take them into the
[55:25] promised land they'd send not send time
[55:27] for but when they didn't believe that he
[55:29] was able to do it he said you go out
[55:32] there until you get this thing
[55:33] straightened out and come back here
[55:35] believing I can do it right what was he
[55:37] wanting them to believe that he was with
[55:39] them right is that not what he would
[55:41] tell who was it to uh Gideon that had so
[55:44] many of doing and they took him out and
[55:46] had him to do certain things and he said
[55:48] because there's too many of you right
[55:50] you'll think you're doing
[55:51] it got it down to a few hundred and he
[55:54] said now we can do it right go and
[55:56] Conquer a whole nation with a handful of
[55:58] people
[56:00] right why because he said to who was it
[56:04] to Moses or Joshua said when you hear
[56:07] the going in the mbery bush Joshua he
[56:11] said you get ready to
[56:12] go I'm going before you you know what
[56:16] when they got there A lot of times they
[56:17] come to find out the Hornets should just
[56:18] took over and run them out they a have
[56:21] to
[56:22] fight see it was because they believed
[56:24] in the present tense God right
[56:26] if you don't believe in the present
[56:27] tense God I w't talk to you out of
[56:29] service because I certainly do I believe
[56:32] in one that's
[56:34] real not up in heaven come on but he's
[56:37] here we've always you heard how many
[56:40] times you I made this statement that we
[56:42] have spent 6,000 years trying to prove
[56:44] there's a God up in heaven and God has
[56:46] spent 6,000 years trying to prove he's
[56:48] down here now how many times have you
[56:50] heard that all right write it down you
[56:52] might want remember that all but now
[56:55] listen
[56:57] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph how long
[57:00] could we go with each one of those as to
[57:04] Abraham actually meeting God right and
[57:08] he fed him communion right how about
[57:11] Moses that had seen God in so many ways
[57:15] but then one day he said Lord and
[57:17] there's only about 10 verses different
[57:19] from when he was seeing God through all
[57:21] of the great things are in the scripture
[57:23] but he turned around and he says Lord
[57:24] I'd like to see you yes amen I just like
[57:29] to see you he said go hide in the cliff
[57:32] to the rock where he' smoked the rock to
[57:33] get the water out of you know go go
[57:35] stick your head in the cliff to the Rock
[57:37] and I'll go by cuz you can't see my face
[57:39] and live he saw the back of him that was
[57:44] the Lord Jesus Christ right amen right
[57:46] cuz that was who it was amen get what
[57:48] I'm talking
[57:50] about God came down to the people of the
[57:53] Old Testament to show himself as being
[57:56] present amen the battle is not yours he
[58:00] would
[58:01] say it is mine amen was it Gideon that
[58:04] took the the lamps and the things and
[58:06] went up you know and they broke the
[58:08] lamps and man they just man just wipe
[58:11] out a whole nation just by busting a few
[58:14] little lamps around you know because the
[58:17] battle was the Lord's it's always been
[58:19] that way but one day see that
[58:23] God of the creation
[58:26] took upon himself the form of his own
[58:29] creation and created a body that he
[58:33] might live in right amen now don't you
[58:35] think that he could say I am here you
[58:40] want scripture Les you believe that I am
[58:43] here don't you unless you believe that I
[58:45] am he right amen you'll die in your sins
[58:49] unless you believe that I'm
[58:52] real let you believe that I'm
[58:55] him
[58:57] but all in his
[58:59] life you remember the thank the quotes
[59:01] we gave the other day where that brother
[59:04] Ram said that Jesus spoke more of his
[59:06] second coming
[59:08] right you know than he did of anything
[59:11] else in his life there see because he
[59:13] was talking about it you know the
[59:14] kingdom to come I must go away this must
[59:17] happen I must give my life that's got to
[59:19] be all of the things he was speaking of
[59:22] those things but he was telling the
[59:24] people don't be afraid
[59:26] I'll go away but the comforter will
[59:31] come well he's going to send somebody
[59:33] else he said no I and my father will
[59:37] come and take up our abat in you that's
[59:39] right in other words going to be with
[59:43] you the same word
[59:45] with is in John to where it says and the
[59:49] Word was with
[59:52] God same word with is the same form that
[59:55] he is using to speak to you and I about
[59:58] the new birth on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:00] God came down to fulfill all of the
[1:00:02] things and started his second
[1:00:09] coming which would be the baptism of the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost coming to Quicken the word
[1:00:13] that the people had held right right and
[1:00:16] bringing the people and making it ready
[1:00:18] for a time that he could live in mankind
[1:00:22] which would be greater fulfillment now
[1:00:25] listen
[1:00:26] don't don't think that God started out
[1:00:28] with something great I remember seeing a
[1:00:30] movie one time and a man was explaining
[1:00:32] oh I'd have Lov been back there to seen
[1:00:34] him open to the Dead Sea I'd have love
[1:00:36] to seen him when he done you know that's
[1:00:37] our
[1:00:39] mind I I I'd love been back out when
[1:00:42] brother Brandon was here well thank God
[1:00:44] we got some Among Us it was that's
[1:00:47] wonderful but I like the
[1:00:49] Bible blessed are your eyes that they
[1:00:52] don't
[1:00:54] see
[1:00:56] but you believe it
[1:00:59] right all right right but you see he was
[1:01:03] talking about his going
[1:01:04] away and he said I'm going to go away
[1:01:07] and I'm going to come back and I'm going
[1:01:08] to start a new creation am a new race of
[1:01:11] people y I'm going to come and live in
[1:01:14] you and that's going to be my second
[1:01:16] coming the bride coming of Christ the
[1:01:18] prophet calls it coming out of the
[1:01:19] church so all the way down through the
[1:01:21] church ages it's been those candlesticks
[1:01:24] we were talking about this this morning
[1:01:26] and God revealing himself in Bride form
[1:01:29] down in the church ages as the son of
[1:01:32] man now listen in the church ages they
[1:01:35] didn't understand son of
[1:01:38] man Paul never wrote of it Peter never
[1:01:40] wrote of it John wrote what Jesus said
[1:01:43] about it but no comments of his own
[1:01:47] about the son of man because they
[1:01:48] couldn't understand that because that's
[1:01:50] what Jesus done when he said to Peter
[1:01:52] that day he said who do Man say I the
[1:01:53] son of man am right Peter said thou the
[1:01:56] Christ the son of the Living God right
[1:01:58] he said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal
[1:02:00] that but my Father revealed it unto you
[1:02:03] paraphrased it put in our language and
[1:02:05] on that I'll be my
[1:02:07] church I'll come and be in the church
[1:02:09] and live in the church but said in the
[1:02:11] end time I'll come back and explain the
[1:02:13] son of
[1:02:14] man because you got to have the son of
[1:02:16] man back in the end time because you
[1:02:17] can't go to the Millennium without him
[1:02:20] that's right you got to fulfill that all
[1:02:22] right now then in the bride coming of
[1:02:25] Christ
[1:02:27] where would it be then like I said about
[1:02:29] Moses he said God is not up in heaven
[1:02:31] God is not over there God is here well
[1:02:34] show me the writings of any of the
[1:02:36] Apostles that put God anywhere
[1:02:40] else Paul picked it up and said God is
[1:02:43] not open in heaven God's Not Over the
[1:02:45] Sea God's not the in mouth the word of
[1:02:47] faith that we preach right now show me
[1:02:49] any of the Apostles contrary to what
[1:02:51] Paul said about
[1:02:54] that see on the day of Pentecost he
[1:02:56] become present tense he was
[1:02:59] D mark this
[1:03:01] down 2,000 years ago a man
[1:03:06] Rose and the message went out that he is
[1:03:10] risen and it took 2,000 years to preach
[1:03:14] that right
[1:03:17] right yeah what will be the message in
[1:03:20] the end time cuz I wouldn't have one it
[1:03:23] made the statement we'll get to
[1:03:24] Wednesday I'm not going to today but
[1:03:26] we'll get to it Wednesday your prophet
[1:03:28] of God said
[1:03:32] that God and his church would unite in
[1:03:35] the last
[1:03:38] days to bring the
[1:03:41] message well what do you mean brother
[1:03:43] Brown brought
[1:03:44] it that's
[1:03:46] wonderful come on but has it been
[1:03:48] revealed to you that's right amen okay
[1:03:51] we'll get to
[1:03:53] that see he said
[1:03:56] I'll never leave
[1:03:59] you he said I've got to go
[1:04:02] away and there's going to be a little
[1:04:04] Gap
[1:04:05] here but said don't worry about it I'll
[1:04:09] be
[1:04:10] back but are we like Joseph and
[1:04:16] Mary that thought Jesus was in their
[1:04:19] midst but you know he never left them
[1:04:22] see we blame him for going away from
[1:04:23] them and they did too you know your
[1:04:26] father and I have sought you
[1:04:29] diligently right well
[1:04:33] now if I had a
[1:04:36] child now come on women if you had a
[1:04:39] baby and that baby was Immaculate
[1:04:42] Conception and it was God in human
[1:04:45] flesh and you told everybody about
[1:04:49] that where would you expect that God to
[1:04:52] be if you lose
[1:04:54] him
[1:04:58] I go to church looking for him wouldn't
[1:05:01] you I sure wouldn't look at him for The
[1:05:04] Honky talks and all of the
[1:05:07] Slime I'd head right back to where he
[1:05:09] supposed to be right instead of that
[1:05:12] they went in the slums no you say you
[1:05:15] don't know well you don't either so
[1:05:17] don't worry about it they went somewhere
[1:05:18] looking for him for three days
[1:05:20] right and then after a while they
[1:05:22] finally doned on them hey we were the
[1:05:24] last time we were there and the last
[1:05:25] time we seen was in the
[1:05:28] temple like I said about the songs of
[1:05:32] Solomon he loved his Vineyard read it
[1:05:35] sometime why didn't that little woman go
[1:05:38] out in the vineyard and sit down and
[1:05:40] wait on Solomon to
[1:05:42] come n she went out in the highways and
[1:05:44] the hedges and saying if you see my love
[1:05:47] tell him I'm looking for it she'd went
[1:05:50] where she was supposed to go right into
[1:05:51] that Garden or was where he was at the
[1:05:53] whole time that's what I'm trying to get
[1:05:55] get you to see God's never left us he
[1:05:58] never left Joseph and Mary he was right
[1:06:00] exactly where he was supposed to be and
[1:06:03] if listen if they were good Christians
[1:06:05] where would they have been
[1:06:07] right right okay now now listen why
[1:06:12] can't we believe then that in the end
[1:06:15] time that God would send
[1:06:17] us a
[1:06:20] prophet send us a man to be able to
[1:06:24] express and now you show me brother
[1:06:26] brandom ever talking about a god up in
[1:06:29] heaven so that's what caught me when I
[1:06:32] first started
[1:06:33] reading the thing that caught me about
[1:06:35] him to make to know that he was a
[1:06:37] prophet I was we Witnesses with brother
[1:06:39] George and brother uh Thomas back there
[1:06:44] they were there and they was telling us
[1:06:46] about it Joyce was a little bit too
[1:06:47] young and little then to tell him much
[1:06:49] about it but you know these others told
[1:06:52] us
[1:06:53] about Charlotte to is still too young to
[1:06:56] be able to tell me about that but you
[1:06:58] know they could tell about uh seeing God
[1:07:01] in a man seeing the dead raised the sick
[1:07:05] healed well that's
[1:07:07] wonderful but you know you can make up
[1:07:09] stories about anything right when
[1:07:12] brother Mo began to tell me about the
[1:07:14] healings and the signs and the
[1:07:17] Wonders I said brother
[1:07:19] Mo you tell me what the man
[1:07:23] taught and if he was a prophet I'll know
[1:07:27] by what he
[1:07:29] Tau sure he said I'm glad you said it
[1:07:32] that way so be he began to express the
[1:07:35] things the prophet had taught
[1:07:37] us and when he did I knew for certainty
[1:07:40] that he he had to be in contact with God
[1:07:43] right cuz he's greater than anything
[1:07:46] else and he could make it so simple but
[1:07:48] he never did Brother Brown never did
[1:07:49] talk about a god somewhere
[1:07:52] else the way we talk see this is the way
[1:07:55] we when I'm doing pretty good God's with
[1:07:58] me but when I ain't doing too good he
[1:08:00] ain't with me now show me that in the
[1:08:03] Bible bless I want it out of the
[1:08:07] scriptures and out of the prophet's
[1:08:09] message he don't leave you you leave him
[1:08:14] right don't ever think God left
[1:08:18] me S
[1:08:21] sa right come on God never left SA
[1:08:27] all left
[1:08:29] God why cuz he went down to the witch of
[1:08:32] indor to find out what was going on even
[1:08:34] in all the bad he done if he just stayed
[1:08:36] away from stuff like
[1:08:40] that I told you about the time we were
[1:08:43] going to send some money some brothers
[1:08:44] wanted us to help some of them in the
[1:08:46] Philippines and this brother had said
[1:08:48] something to me and I was over there and
[1:08:49] he mentioned something to me this other
[1:08:50] brother said if I was you I'd got to
[1:08:52] watch it he didn't say nothing else and
[1:08:54] he didn't know about what was going on
[1:08:55] either
[1:08:57] I decided well I better back off maybe
[1:08:59] and
[1:09:02] uh so I found out through secondary ways
[1:09:08] that the man was taking the money that
[1:09:11] was giving him and buying up a bunch of
[1:09:15] goats and you know what he was doing
[1:09:17] with
[1:09:18] them they were sacrificing them to the
[1:09:22] idols to try to get favor with the
[1:09:27] gods I'm not joking you just happened
[1:09:31] right it's because they were trying to
[1:09:33] find all of the gold it's the Japanese
[1:09:35] they know there's a bunch of gold left
[1:09:37] on on in the Philippines that the
[1:09:39] Japanese had this carbox loads of
[1:09:42] gold and they're still looking for a lot
[1:09:45] of
[1:09:46] it but see they were going to sacrifice
[1:09:48] in other words that's what he wanted
[1:09:49] money from me was to buy goats to be
[1:09:51] able to sacrifice to a go to some kind
[1:09:53] of a idol to get it and I'm glad I
[1:09:56] didn't have much to do with it cuz I
[1:09:58] didn't didn't think about that I thought
[1:10:00] of what brother randam said he said I
[1:10:03] could have told them where that oil well
[1:10:05] was
[1:10:07] at he said I could have told him he said
[1:10:09] but they doing it for the wrong thing he
[1:10:12] said they missed it they got closed he
[1:10:15] said but somebody else that was a
[1:10:16] worldly person come in and hit a gusher
[1:10:18] cuz they drilled right where he knew
[1:10:20] where the go the oil was at but listen
[1:10:22] Church what are you talking about we had
[1:10:25] had a man coming in the come in the last
[1:10:27] days that never spoke of a god up in
[1:10:30] heaven he spoke of a God that was right
[1:10:32] with us right he spoke of a living
[1:10:34] reality of God that no man had ever
[1:10:37] preached like it and he would even stand
[1:10:40] there and he'd say if I have told you
[1:10:41] the truth then let him
[1:10:45] come where did he ever fail that's right
[1:10:48] God would always step on the scene at
[1:10:51] the man's
[1:10:52] voice a great reality here's something I
[1:10:55] told you to write down how many wrote
[1:10:58] this down you remember the message that
[1:11:00] we preached on a couple of services like
[1:11:03] the appearing and the
[1:11:07] coming do you even remember the
[1:11:10] messages I hope you at least the
[1:11:14] titles but you remember what I said then
[1:11:17] what did I
[1:11:19] say I said if you'll notice that brother
[1:11:21] brandham always used the word appearing
[1:11:23] and coming in the same phrase
[1:11:29] statement up until
[1:11:33] 1962 he used the word appearing and
[1:11:36] coming after 62
[1:11:38] sure but he never used them together
[1:11:41] expressing that there's a difference in
[1:11:43] his appearing and his
[1:11:45] coming you remember I told you to write
[1:11:47] that
[1:11:48] down that I get back to it later you
[1:11:51] know well you know when I make him
[1:11:53] statements I make them hoping you write
[1:11:56] it down or when I get back to it it
[1:11:57] won't be a
[1:11:59] blank I didn't remember you saying
[1:12:02] it but see there's a
[1:12:04] reason because see brother brandham up
[1:12:06] until that time he had in his mind
[1:12:10] exactly what scripture was that there is
[1:12:13] appearing and coming and that there's
[1:12:14] two different
[1:12:16] things he's appearing and then he's
[1:12:18] coming he can appear out here in
[1:12:19] organize religion save the people heal
[1:12:22] the people but that's not his coming
[1:12:24] right right there's a difference in
[1:12:26] appearing and coming you see after 62 or
[1:12:29] especially after the opening of the
[1:12:30] seals show me brother brand I'm talking
[1:12:35] about something that was
[1:12:38] coming or something about
[1:12:42] appearing sure he would say the Lord's
[1:12:45] coming don't misunderstand me right he
[1:12:48] would say the Lord is coming yes we're
[1:12:50] looking for his coming but then he
[1:12:53] turned right around and tell you the
[1:12:54] Lord's here
[1:12:59] right like all of the prophets of the
[1:13:02] Bible he never spoke of a god coming he
[1:13:05] spoke of a God that was here right
[1:13:09] right now
[1:13:11] listen in
[1:13:17] 1982 in
[1:13:19] 79 I preached the seals 1 2 3 4 5 6
[1:13:24] 7 and I had
[1:13:27] a place there I couldn't cross
[1:13:30] over it was something I couldn't
[1:13:34] understand I know it got to be me to
[1:13:37] understand it
[1:13:39] okay and I waited but in 1982 God showed
[1:13:43] what I needed and I preached the seals
[1:13:47] again in ' 82 and
[1:13:48] 83 and on that seventh
[1:13:51] seal I said the seventh seal is his
[1:13:56] coming Brother Gary could probably give
[1:13:58] you the tape number and the the dates on
[1:14:02] it cuz he used to listen to him as
[1:14:05] well but you see I saw what the coming
[1:14:07] of the Lord
[1:14:11] was 82 yeah 82
[1:14:15] 83 I saw that what I had preached in
[1:14:20] 1969 that the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:23] Christ would be
[1:14:26] the son of man amen the word made
[1:14:29] manifest upon earth right first sermon I
[1:14:32] preached in Athens Georgia
[1:14:36] 1969 and until this day I don't have to
[1:14:39] change any of
[1:14:40] that because what I saw there in the
[1:14:43] opening of the seventh seal I didn't see
[1:14:46] God out under coming this way because
[1:14:48] that's not the
[1:14:49] word I told you the other day keep close
[1:14:51] attention to when your Prophet is
[1:14:53] talking and he'll say the seven seal is
[1:14:56] the coming of the
[1:15:00] Lord and that's what he
[1:15:02] been he's been coming for 2,000 years
[1:15:06] right see we're looking at it no it's
[1:15:09] going to be out here somewhere and when
[1:15:11] it does he'll come you
[1:15:13] know well you still got you to to doot
[1:15:16] to doot in the trumpets and the sound
[1:15:17] and all of the horns
[1:15:22] right what you see
[1:15:25] when I saw what the coming of the Lord
[1:15:27] is I didn't see him off somewhere
[1:15:31] else and you don't face a Doctrine Upon
[1:15:34] A
[1:15:35] Dream but I told a
[1:15:38] dream can you remember
[1:15:41] it I was dreaming about the coming of
[1:15:44] the
[1:15:46] Lord and in the
[1:15:49] dream it
[1:15:51] says it's
[1:15:53] reproduction
[1:15:59] I got
[1:16:01] up I didn't look up the word
[1:16:06] reproduction I knew what that
[1:16:09] meant to produce again sensible you know
[1:16:13] what word I looked
[1:16:15] up the word e n
[1:16:19] d e n d cuz brother brandham said the
[1:16:23] seventh seal is is the end of all things
[1:16:27] is that a direct quote seventh seal is
[1:16:30] the end of all things that's right all
[1:16:33] right and I knew my dream was
[1:16:37] spiritual so well how' you know that
[1:16:40] because see when something is the word
[1:16:42] end and I wish I could find the channel
[1:16:44] and and I will one day I'll get it all
[1:16:46] down get my dictionaries and I'll find
[1:16:48] it for you because the word e n d means
[1:16:51] to
[1:16:52] reproduce right
[1:16:56] no in means like the platform there and
[1:16:59] you just stepped off of
[1:17:02] it or the wall that's the end you
[1:17:06] know that's what you
[1:17:10] think the word end doesn't mean that in
[1:17:13] biblical terminologies when something is
[1:17:17] reproduced you have brought it to an end
[1:17:21] cuz it's not going to be a reproduction
[1:17:22] of the
[1:17:23] reproduction
[1:17:26] right right right when something comes
[1:17:29] to an end it's reproduced right when
[1:17:31] Jesus Christ comes in his bride the way
[1:17:35] he was here in mortal flesh outside of
[1:17:39] the body of human flesh that he in Jesus
[1:17:42] thank you but becomes visible Among Us
[1:17:45] that is the end of all things
[1:17:47] come that's right it all be brought to
[1:17:50] an end thank you
[1:17:53] Jesus
[1:17:55] but are we
[1:17:59] like Israel was of
[1:18:03] old that Moses God told Moses he said at
[1:18:08] the burning
[1:18:09] bush he said you go get my
[1:18:13] people did you bring them out
[1:18:17] here and said I'm going to come down in
[1:18:19] front of all of them and show your
[1:18:23] right
[1:18:25] show that I spoke to you I'll become
[1:18:28] visable among
[1:18:31] you
[1:18:33] well you know that's what happened right
[1:18:37] Moses told him God told me to go get you
[1:18:40] and take you out we're going out to to
[1:18:42] that same Mountain I was in and God is
[1:18:44] going to show you what I said is true
[1:18:47] because he's going to come down where
[1:18:49] you can see him
[1:18:50] y well what happened right
[1:18:57] when they got out there with a mountain
[1:18:58] on fire like I've told you over and over
[1:19:00] and over and over one more
[1:19:03] time Moses had one burning bush whole
[1:19:06] Mountain was on fire every Israelite had
[1:19:09] a bush all they had to do is get in
[1:19:11] front of it and talk to
[1:19:14] God well there well you tell me what it
[1:19:20] is but before they got there they had
[1:19:23] sinned like everything
[1:19:25] that's right and what was their
[1:19:28] statement oh they were
[1:19:31] afraid you mean the god of creation is
[1:19:34] coming down into your presence and
[1:19:37] you're
[1:19:37] afraid come on folks now they wern't
[1:19:39] afraid of the Mountain of burning and it
[1:19:42] falling down on them because they could
[1:19:43] stand back farther enough to look at it
[1:19:45] you know two or three miles if they
[1:19:46] needed to you
[1:19:48] know probably not with binoculars but
[1:19:51] they did have a lot of things back
[1:19:53] then
[1:19:55] but they wern't afraid that the mountain
[1:19:57] was going to fall on
[1:20:00] them they were afraid of the god in the
[1:20:03] mountain
[1:20:05] amen and they didn't see that God
[1:20:07] personal because Moses was afraid when
[1:20:10] the burning bush and went up but it
[1:20:12] doesn't say about Moses that he was so
[1:20:14] scared to death and he just shaking and
[1:20:16] oh Lord what no no no he was standing in
[1:20:19] a holy
[1:20:20] reverence a fear yes but a holy reever
[1:20:25] fear in front of a living God brother
[1:20:28] Brandon said when his presence
[1:20:31] comes he said you're
[1:20:33] afraid they said what about that angel
[1:20:35] brother brandom why don't you ask him
[1:20:37] his
[1:20:38] name he said you don't talk when he's
[1:20:41] there
[1:20:43] right it's a holy
[1:20:45] reverence holy fear right is not a
[1:20:48] scared shaking in your boot heals what
[1:20:50] you
[1:20:51] heal just like I tried to explain here
[1:20:54] not too long long
[1:20:55] ago there when Jesus he was
[1:20:59] asleep and they woke him
[1:21:02] up the Bible said they were afraid right
[1:21:06] they was afraid and they woke him up
[1:21:09] aren't you afraid we're going to drown
[1:21:12] he just turned around walked over and
[1:21:13] set his foot up me he said peace be
[1:21:16] still now read your Bible Mark 4 and 41
[1:21:20] read it they became exceedingly fearful
[1:21:28] what the waves was done the boat was
[1:21:34] Cal no because they seen who was in the
[1:21:37] boat with
[1:21:39] them why is the presence of God to be
[1:21:42] something that would make us afraid
[1:21:46] right the main reason is because it
[1:21:48] we're Sinners that's
[1:21:52] right but just remember one thing he got
[1:21:55] in the boat with them they didn't force
[1:21:57] him to get in that boat and ride with
[1:22:00] them I love what the prophets I said
[1:22:02] while ago said when the Jehovah the Old
[1:22:05] Testament had come down I didn't get to
[1:22:06] the Finish point he come down and he
[1:22:08] just busied himself like a father all
[1:22:10] the things that was taking
[1:22:12] place you remember old bam and B you
[1:22:15] know and trying to get him to curse him
[1:22:18] said look right here at the back Park
[1:22:20] look at all the bad things they're
[1:22:23] doing the prophet of God looked down and
[1:22:25] said I'm looking through God's eyes and
[1:22:28] I can't see nothing that they're doing
[1:22:31] amen I only see the shout of the king in
[1:22:33] the
[1:22:36] camp that's right but you
[1:22:39] see we don't actually believe what the
[1:22:41] New Birth really is
[1:22:45] Right Jesus said Matthew 28:20 we go to
[1:22:48] 2819 we love that about the
[1:22:51] baptisms but what about 20 where I am
[1:22:54] with you
[1:22:55] all didn't say
[1:22:57] always
[1:23:00] all even until the end of the Earth
[1:23:05] right brother Dale is there any way for
[1:23:08] us to stand in the presence of God
[1:23:10] yes through the atonement that was made
[1:23:14] that he made it was an advocate for you
[1:23:16] and I as
[1:23:19] Sinners or you think you're sinless I'm
[1:23:21] sinless in Christ amen I'm not sinless
[1:23:24] in myself come on I'm sinless in Christ
[1:23:27] he don't see me he's looking at the
[1:23:29] blood come on thank you Lord I'm going
[1:23:32] to start preaching some messages pretty
[1:23:34] quick once I finish this a little
[1:23:36] further and you're going to think that
[1:23:38] brother Dale has sure backslid on his
[1:23:40] preaching
[1:23:43] bless you better
[1:23:46] remember a statement of
[1:23:49] made I've preached a many of things over
[1:23:52] again right brother Gary but all always
[1:23:54] when I preach it again it goes a little
[1:23:56] higher
[1:23:58] right I'd write that
[1:24:00] down it'll go a little higher each step
[1:24:03] right but it may be so simple like this
[1:24:05] I won't even have nothing but just a a
[1:24:08] topic to go
[1:24:09] on I want you to see that God is real
[1:24:14] Amen in
[1:24:16] life now just for one
[1:24:20] minute how many over all of these years
[1:24:23] has heard me try to explain this is 198
[1:24:26] through2 that I was explaining what the
[1:24:29] word come is you ever looked it
[1:24:34] up coming is a word of
[1:24:40] travel but it says in in psalmist he
[1:24:43] that
[1:24:44] cometh cometh means to be
[1:24:47] there the word come means to be
[1:24:52] here I say to brother Mark I said
[1:24:54] brother Mark come to see me all right
[1:24:56] now he's got to get to where I'm at for
[1:24:57] that can be fulfilled right right cuz if
[1:25:01] not he's in
[1:25:03] travel but once he stands in my
[1:25:08] presence then what I said about come to
[1:25:11] see
[1:25:14] me now it's
[1:25:17] real the word come means to be
[1:25:23] here
[1:25:25] now for 2,000 years we've been preaching
[1:25:28] he is risen
[1:25:30] right now why can't we start preaching
[1:25:33] he's
[1:25:36] here now you come and show me anywhere
[1:25:39] in my whole Ministry from from the
[1:25:41] beginning until this day that that's not
[1:25:43] been my thought right I've always
[1:25:46] preached about a living reality of a
[1:25:48] living God
[1:25:52] right why because I saw
[1:25:55] God and I'm tried to explain it to you
[1:25:58] where' you see that brother Dale right
[1:26:00] here in the word amen
[1:26:04] right when it says it was with
[1:26:08] God then I know that that's not two
[1:26:12] people the way I love it is the way your
[1:26:14] brother your Prophet said he said the
[1:26:17] godhead is not
[1:26:20] complete without you amen amen
[1:26:26] Hallelujah I see people just pass over
[1:26:28] those
[1:26:30] statements they don't underline them
[1:26:32] they just it just right through the mind
[1:26:33] you know it's
[1:26:38] gone
[1:26:40] well he said he not complete without you
[1:26:44] thank you Lord he chose it that
[1:26:47] way I never chose
[1:26:49] him you didn't
[1:26:51] need he chose you
[1:26:54] well if he
[1:26:56] chose well that just means i' going to
[1:26:58] live like the devil cuz I he chose me
[1:27:02] not you got a
[1:27:04] misconception a mixed up mind a
[1:27:07] perverted Satan's
[1:27:10] place but to be just human beings and to
[1:27:13] realize that there's none of us worthy
[1:27:15] of God standing in our presence
[1:27:17] whatsoever that's right the prophet of
[1:27:19] God said on the Hebrew Book he said I'd
[1:27:21] hate to think that I was born five
[1:27:23] minutes ago yeah and how to stand in
[1:27:25] front of a living God with some merits
[1:27:27] that I would
[1:27:28] have he said cuz I born in sin shaping
[1:27:31] in iniquity spouse my mother's wound a
[1:27:33] liar
[1:27:35] right but when he said come unto me all
[1:27:37] you that labor and heavy lab and I'll
[1:27:39] give you rest
[1:27:40] right he says come boldly Before the
[1:27:43] Throne
[1:27:45] amen well bless God he owes it to me
[1:27:48] I'll go that's what the kids
[1:27:51] say you brought me into the world
[1:27:56] yeah you take care of
[1:27:58] me I can I can take you out of the
[1:28:03] world is that what you want
[1:28:07] no I'll call a def facts or what it
[1:28:14] did
[1:28:16] no I'm talking about God's here folks
[1:28:18] I'm not talking about a god up in
[1:28:20] heaven since I saw that in the prophet's
[1:28:23] message when I seen it come in this
[1:28:24] message I'm never preached to God in
[1:28:27] heaven how many remembers this statement
[1:28:30] 30 years ago probably I said I'm
[1:28:32] quitting trying to go to
[1:28:35] heaven I'm trying to preach God is here
[1:28:39] and many remers that
[1:28:42] statement God is
[1:28:46] here he's not somewhere
[1:28:49] H even if you don't have the new birth
[1:28:53] he's right there with you talking to you
[1:28:55] right trying to help
[1:28:59] you you know if you're going down the
[1:29:00] road and the car starts the wheel starts
[1:29:02] spinning and you uh you know what you
[1:29:05] call it hydroplaning on the everything
[1:29:07] and you're you're fixing to run into
[1:29:08] something you don't have time to stop
[1:29:10] and say wait just a minute now hold it I
[1:29:12] got to
[1:29:16] pray brother said
[1:29:19] Joshua did not have time to pray he said
[1:29:22] but he realized he was prayed through
[1:29:25] before the foundation of the
[1:29:29] world

[1:35:06] brother Dale how can you be like you are
[1:35:09] to stand up and preach and to stand
[1:35:11] before all of the people of this message
[1:35:14] some of you been in places that we were
[1:35:15] in to were that I had to stand and take
[1:35:18] a stand but how do you how can you do
[1:35:21] that not because I'm stubborn I'm I'm a
[1:35:24] whole lot smarter than that but because
[1:35:27] God said he would be with
[1:35:32] me we were going to a ministers meeting
[1:35:34] one night going to leave the next day
[1:35:37] and it was going to be on a certain
[1:35:39] thing on marriage and divorce and I
[1:35:41] would back in probably that
[1:35:43] corner
[1:35:47] praying and there's always one scripture
[1:35:49] worried me about
[1:35:52] it
[1:35:55] and I thought
[1:35:58] Lord be with us in the meeting we're
[1:36:00] going to have because they were coming
[1:36:03] in 20 30 preachers and some big ones big
[1:36:06] names were going to be
[1:36:08] there said I know these things are going
[1:36:11] to be brought
[1:36:14] up this scripture right here has always
[1:36:16] bothered
[1:36:18] me we there in Deuteronomy where it says
[1:36:22] that if a man finds some fault and his
[1:36:25] wife put her away she goes to be another
[1:36:26] man's wife and all the that and the
[1:36:28] other and it looks like it's saying it's
[1:36:31] okay for her to do it I said Lord I know
[1:36:33] that's wrong speak to my
[1:36:37] heart he
[1:36:39] said that means that she is going to do
[1:36:42] it doesn't mean it's okay I'm not okay
[1:36:45] and it to be done we go on to the
[1:36:47] ministers meet and still didn't know got
[1:36:50] up it was my time to speak
[1:36:54] once you got through speaking they had
[1:36:56] questions and answers for hours whatever
[1:36:58] it
[1:37:00] took and I was up there speaking and
[1:37:02] this man brought up that
[1:37:04] scripture and this man was a
[1:37:08] theologian he was a Greek
[1:37:11] scholar a
[1:37:13] theologian I'm not kidding I won't call
[1:37:15] his
[1:37:17] name he brought that scripture up and I
[1:37:19] looked right back at him as a brother
[1:37:20] with him brought it up I looked back at
[1:37:22] the brother I said now brother you're
[1:37:24] standing
[1:37:27] here where I was I was standing there
[1:37:29] and I said that can't be what that man
[1:37:33] says cuz that would mean God is okay in
[1:37:35] prostitution and that won't
[1:37:38] work he just got real quiet and wouldn't
[1:37:40] say
[1:37:42] nothing I said brother you're going to
[1:37:44] have to make a
[1:37:46] statement I said now is that man
[1:37:48] right that it's okay in prostitution or
[1:37:52] am I right about what I say
[1:37:54] that that is not what God is saying he's
[1:37:56] not saying she can he's saying she will
[1:37:58] do
[1:38:01] it he sat there for a moment I said
[1:38:04] brother what do you
[1:38:06] say is he right or am I
[1:38:12] right he shook his head to in
[1:38:14] verification I said it's on tight that
[1:38:16] the brother shaking his head to show
[1:38:18] that that man's
[1:38:19] wrong but what I'm saying is right well
[1:38:23] see I how do you think I
[1:38:24] felt I knew who was standing there not
[1:38:28] me but I was in contact with
[1:38:32] somebody that had the answer and I
